Three people play

by Laura Powers
Staff Wrder

Three Pitt students walk around
campus with a secret identity. Sepa-
rated by classes, hometowns and
majors, they unite under one mask
— that of Roc, the Pitt Panther mas-
cot.

Athletic department regulations
require current mascots to remain
anonymous. So for this article,
thefll go by Roc 1, Roc 2 and Roc
3. It’s part of their allure, they say.

“It’s something we’ve just always
done,” said Theresa Nuzzo, the
mascots’ coach. “It’s kind of like a
mystique, a hidden  as to who’s
really in there.”

Roc 2 said he enjoys" the ano-
nymity. It allows him to be more
outgoing than he normally would
be, and to have a little extra fun.

One day, Pontiac had a car dis-
played at Heinz Field, and Roc 2
decided to hop in the driver’s seat.

“I just got in the car and started
beeping the horn and stuff and the
guy was laughing,” he said. “But if
a normal man would do that, they

might call the police.”
Earning these privileges, the
mascots say, is no easy task.
Potential Pitt mascots undergo

a thorough audition process, where

Nuzzo said she looks at their athlet-
icism, rhythm, creativity and char-
acter when in uniform. Nuzzo asks
the candidates to dance and act out
a given scenario.

Roc 1, who acted as the sole
panther last year and is currently on
a break while he recovers from knee

. surgery, said he thought the audition

would only involve him speaking to
the coach. He said he was surprised
when Nuzzo asked him to dem-
onstrate how he would pump up
the crowd if Pitt was down by two

one role

with 30 seconds left in a basketball
game.

Roc 1, who had never been to
a basketball game before, said he
found the whole process “nerve-
wracking.”

After they make it through the
audition process, mascots are re-
sponsible for attending football and
basketball games, as well as charity
events and other public functions.
Some people, Roc 2 said, even re-
quest that the panther attend their
wedding. The Rocs divide the
events among themselves.

Roc 3 said he particularly enjoys
going to the sporting events, where
everyone surrounding him gets
“caught up in the moment.” He said
it’s worth getting suited up in a hot
uniform if he can help people enjoy
the game and get a good laugh.

“It’s ridiculous. I’ve literally
probably lost 10 pounds during a
game,” he said.

“As goofy a job as it is, it’s an
honor to be able to put it on and
have fun with it,” he said.

raise $2

» by Kelly Thomas
Staﬁ’ W/riter

If you think this year’s presidential election
has lasted a long time, Pitt has been on the
campaign trail way longer than that

The  Our Future Together capital
campaign was launched officially in 2000 with
a goal of raising $500 million mainly for newly
endowed scholarships, said Tom Crawford, as-
sociate Vice chancellor for corporate and foun-
dation relations. 3

The goal doubled twice, once in 2002 when
the University reached the
original one, and  in
2006 when it hit the $1 bil-
lion mark

As of this fall, Pitt has
raised $1.27 billion out of a
$2 billion goal for its capital
campaign, according to a
news release.

Crawford stated that
other targets for the money raised during the
campaign include creating endowed fellow-
ships and faculty positions and  re-
search iniﬁatives. -

“What we’rc really  to do with the
second half of the campaign is to support the
chancellor’s desire to support students,” he
said. ‘

According. to the release, Pitt created 398
new endowed scholarship funds, 32 new en-
dowed fellowship funds and 98 new endowed
faculty positions, in addition to various student
life initiatives and construction and develop-
ment projects.

Another landmark in the’ Building Our
Future Together capital campaign was well-
known engineer and Pitt alumnus and trustee
John A. Swanson’s $43.1 million  to the

School of Engineering last year.

. ﬂome<§<bmag, A€:C>C)cff>

 

October 24, 2008

billion

According to the School of Engineering’s

‘Web site, the money funded the expansion
project of Benedum Hall, which started ear-
lier this year; created an endowed fund that
will provide scholarships, fellowships and fac-
ulty support; and provided the school with an
income to help it keep up with technological
advancements.

Swanson’s donation is the largest from a
single donor in Pitt’s history, and the school
was renamed to the Swanson School of Engi-
neering.

Crawford emphasized that Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg’s main
goal, and the main goal of
the campaign, is to raise
money for new endowed
scholarships.

“There is a heavy em-

phasis on student support
scholarships,” said Craw-
ford. ”
_ Pitt set 2014 as the year
by which it wants to reach its $2 billion goal,
although it hopes to reach the goal early, Craw-
ford said. _

He added that all universities employ the
same type of fundraising and that capital cam-
paigns encompass all funds raised by the uni-
versity  a given time period.

Money for the campaign comes from foun-
dations, corporations, disease—speciﬁc founda-
tions such as the American Heait Foundation
and individual donors.

Crawford said that 37 percent of funds
have come from foundations. Some notable
donations include $13 million from the Rich-
ard  Mellon Foundation to establish and
support a pediauic research institution and
two grants totaling $21.4 million from the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation for vaccine re-
search. \ .

Nationality Rooms

 

I 

into the country's cultu-re.

by Nicole McIntyre
Staﬂ WrL'ter

Only,in Pittsburgh can students tour the
world without leaving city limits. _

Walk into the Cathedral of Learning, and
you can catch a glimpse of other cultures by
visiting one of the 27 Nationality Rooms lo-
cated on the building’s first and third ﬂoors.

Each. room represents and is sponsored by
representatives of a different culture.

, One of the newest additions to the Na-
tionality Rooms, the Welsh Room that was un-
veiled June 1, is a prime example, said Maxine
Bruhns, director of programs for the Nation-
ality Rooms. . ‘

“The Welsh Room is an example of alcha—

pel built in the late 1800s,” said Bruhns, who
gives public tours of the rooms. "They de—',
signed a simple room with a very decorative
clock.” 0

Bruhns said that in the next few years the Uni-
versity will unveil Turkish, Swiss, Filipino and

 orld tour

Korean rooms. The Turkish Room, she said,
should be ready for touring by next year. 0

“Creating a room isn’t cheap, you know,”
said Bruhns. “Today, the designing of one
room costs between ‘400 and 500 thousand
dollars.”

Bruhns said that each room is funded by
the communities that they represent.

Upon completion” of the designing and
dedication, the cultural community passes on
the key to the room to the chancellor in a cer-
emony. A '

The rooms began in 1938. The mission
was to create classrooms that would repre-
sent creative time periods and various cultures.
john Bowman, chancellor at the time, began
this effort by informing cultural communities
in Allegheny County‘ about the project. But,
eventually, nations overseas heard about Pitt’s
Nationality Rooms.

As a result, the Nationality Room program
staff gives more than 30,000 tours every year.

Tours cost $1 for children and $3 for adults

  University offers a 'menu'r of

options to potential donors

Campaign, page 10
Another 12 percent comes from corpora-
tions ‘

Take, for example, the $500,000 donation _

from the US. Steel Foundation, for scholar-
ships.
Disease—speciﬁc foundations donate 13

percent of funds. Their money generally goes *

toward  cures for or working toward the
eradication of specific diseases.

The rest of the money, 48 percent, comes
from individual donors and the Annual Fund,
said Crawford.

The Annual Fund secures donations
through mailing lists and the Pitt TeleFund.
Both target alumni, friends of the University
and current and retired faculty and staff

He said that although donors may give larg-
er gifts over a period of several years, most of
the annual  are one—time donations.

‘ Pitt generally initiates Contact with the

foundations and corporations that donate,
Crawford said.

“Most of what we do is build relation-
ships,” said Crawford.

Staff members from the Office of Insti-
tutional Advancement meet with potential
donors to ﬁnd out what the organization is in-
terested in supporting and then come back to
them with a “menu” of what Pitt offers in that
ﬁeld. - _

‘‘\We’ll keep your intent in mind,” said Craw-
ford, “but it has to go back to address a need
on our en .”

He said that both Pitt and the donor must
agree on what is to be done with the money
before Pitt can accept it.

The Office of Institutional Advancement
assigns staff members to work with each
school within the University on fundraising
initiatives.

Students enjoy classrooms,

except for the wooden chairs

Rooms, page
and are offered by appointment seven days a

week from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m.

The money raised from the tours is used to
pay the tour guides and to assure the mainte-
nance of the rooms, which are inspected every
Friday. I

“Some of the rooms were dedicated in
1938 and still look like new,” said Bruhns.

Manyof the rooms, of course, host classes
as well.

Student Courtney Strauss said the Nation-
ality Rooms have a different feel from other
classrooms.’

“I love  public speaking class in the
India Room,” she said. “It’s beautiful, and the
U—shaped seating allows for great face-to-face
interaction and class discussions.”

Student Warren Barnes agreed, for the

most part;
“I think the rooms bring a very unique
touch to the Cathedral, regardless "of how un-
comfortable the seats [are] in some rooms,” he
said.
The Nationality Room program staff will
host a free open house on Dec 7‘ to show off

the rooms’ Christmas decorations. Bruhns

noted  while the event is only one evening,
the" decorations will be on display between

. Nov. 16 andjan. _11. The open house will take
. place from noon until 4 p.m., and Bruhn an— .

ticipates that between 2,000 and 3,000 people
will attend. »

On this day, the tour guides will dress in
clothes that are traditional for the cultures rep-
resented by the rooms. Cultural performances
will take place every 15 minutes.

You can't take the panther out of the mascot

Panther, page 6

the part of Roc the Panther before
said the experience had a profound
effect on them.

Rand Werrin, who was the mas-
cot in the early ’60s, said he’s as en-
thusiastic about Pitt athletics now as
he was when he was student here.
A dentist with an ofﬁce just blocks
away from the University, \X/errin
wears his “Let’s Go Pitt” T-shirt
every Friday and attends every foot-
ball and basketball game he can.

Werrin said that when he was
a student here, he loved Pitt foot-
ball so much he nied to play on
the team. But an encounter with
Pitt alumnus Mike  made him
think twice about try-outs.

“I got into the elevator in Schen-
ley Hall, and this person stands in
front of me and he’s taking the en-
tire space. He was twice the size of
me,” said Wernn. “I realized at that
point I’d better go out for the pan-
ther, because I wasn’t going to beat
this guy out for football.”

\X/errin said he felt being the
mascot was the only way he was go-
ing to get out onto the ﬁeld.

Two Convenient Locations!

During his reign as Roc, \X/errin
said he used to do a lot of stunts
to stir up the student section. At
a game against Miami, he said he
took one of the opponent’s palm
trees and planted it in the broad
jumping pit in Pitt Stadium.

\When playing University of
Southern California, he had a joust—
ing contest against their Trojan
mascot. He even decided to milk
the Navy goat one game, and the
Navy’s student section ripped off
his  He said, though, that he
never lost when there was a wres-
tling match between him and an-
other mascot.

“When I was the panther, I used
to wrestle with them because I was
a state wrestling champion,” he said.
“So I’d always win, and that was a
lot of fun.”

Now, Nuzzo said, mascots are
only allowed to interact with each
other in ways that promote good
sportsmanship.

“They put rules across the board
for all mascots that there’s no inter-
action, per say, and there’s no taunt-

ing or anything with each other,”
said Nuzzo. “It has to be in good
sportsmanship and a good repre-
sentation of the University.”

John Ashcroft, who was the
mascot from 2000-04, said that he
once scheduled a ﬁght against the
Alabama Birmingham mascot dur-
ing a game. The ﬁght left him with
a bloody nose.

“I got my [butt] kicked by the
mascot,” said Ashcroft. “We had a
scheduled ﬁght for the third quarter
of the game, and he came out really
ﬁghting. I didn’t realize it was going
to be a real ﬁght; Usually you have
it staged, but he was actually slain-
ming as hard as he could.”

Ashcroft said that his role as the
panther has only increased his af-
fection for the University.

“I have so much love for Pitt now
because of it. I got to travel with the
team. I was there when we won and
when we lost,” said Ashcroft; “The
experience I got being the panther
has deﬁnitely been pretty rare, [and]
I don’t think a lot of students get
that kind of experience.”

 

Michael Heaterl Photo Editor
The mascots say their costumes are so hot they can sweat off pounds
during a single game. But, they say, it's worth it if the crowd has a
good time.

Butl at the same time respect the idea of the Green
Party or any party  to provide opposition or
another choice I agree that that’s good for democ-
mqg,

North also ran for US. Congress as the Green
Party candidate against Doyle in 2006 and for mayor
of Pittsburgh in 2005.

North said that Doyle is better than about 80
percent of Congressmen because of his voting
record, but he considers the standard that they set
to be low Doyle voted in favor of the government
bailout; which North said ‘ ‘is  dictatzorial pow-
ers to Secretary  Paulson, to the administra-
tion”

Instead of a massive government bailout plan,
North said he would have worked to reduce the
payments of people with housing loans so they
could continue  banks This is whatjapan did
in response to its economic crisis, which North con-
siders comparable to the current one in the United
States

Much of North’s knowledge about economics
comes from his studies in East Asia After North
graduated from Hawaii Loa College in 1984, he
moved tojapan, where he lived for nine and a half
years While  injapan, he experienced an eco
nomic crisis that stemmed from the housing sector

“The bubble was enormous, such that in 1989-
1990, the land that Tokyo sits on was worth more,’ ’
he said. ‘N1 the land in Tokyo added up together
was worth more than the land in the entire United
States.”

\When the bubble collapsed, North said, the
Japanese government tried many plans to resolve
the problem, including pushing a govemment—
sponsored bailout plan similar to the one Congress

“This bill that got pushed through Congress
—-this typeof rernedyhadabsolutelyno effect,
no desirous  When they gave money
to companies without condition, when they gave
money to banks without condition, within less than
ayear,itwas mostiyalllos ” saidNorth. “If youuse

North's love for politics  
traces to his childhood  

North, page 20
with the lan ”

For North, itwas almostas if hewas predestined
to become involved with politics He was born in
Atianta, Ga, but he grew up in Ariington, Va, with
his parents and older brother and sister. There he
foundhimself stuﬂingenvelopes at the local George
McGovern for President headquarters at age 11. As
a child, he frequentiy took buses to \X/ashingtion,
DC, where he made the US Capitol building his

personal playground

"They didn’t have all the security back then.
So the Capitol building was just like a playground
for me, and I’d run ’ said North. “Outside
the Capitol building there was this little gazebo We
[North andhis playmates] wererftreally supposedto
go into it, but we just hopped over the fence, and
underneath the gazebo, it looked like a dungeon So
we’cl just playlike itwas our dungeon”

North’s  attended many protests when he ‘

wasgrowingupduringtheV1etnam\War:Thepo—
litical activism helped him decide that he wanted to
become a politician. ‘

In 1984 and 1988, North worked on 

]ackson’s presidential  North said he acl— A

mired Jackson for  about poor people, and
not just the middle class North respected Jackson
forhis peaceful foreign policy and his proposal to cut
the defense budget during the Cold War: I

After a while, North became disillusioned. He
said due the politicians getting elected were selling
out and that he couldn’t bring in the big bucks to be
nominated by the Democratic Party, his party at the
time I

“So I went into academia So I studied it, and I
remained interested,” said North “I studied it, but
I just thought I couldn’t go out and try to raise big

_ bucks, and sell out my principles’ ’

When North moved tojapan in 1989, he began
 at Thompson Corporation, now Thomp
son Reuters, and he studied international relations
at Sophia University in Tokyo “North still works for
Thompson Reuters today,  a daily 

digest of thejapanese ﬁnancial press In]apan,'he

China,” said Tran. “You always get the best eduQ1—
tion from experience It seems like he did that ex-
perience  He’s very inspirational in that
aspect, to me”

However,Transaidshewasunsurewhatkind
of politician North would make beaause of his ran-
dom  style.

“I thinkheneeds t:omasterbeingaprofessorbe-
fore he can be a politician He doesn’t 
have that presence He’s kind of goofyf’ saidTran.

North wrote a book called “Operation Pani-
otic Toilet Seat” that was published in August. It
is a ﬁctional take on the “Big Brother” role of the
government" The ﬁctional book’s plotis about Pres-

ident Gerald Ford’s adrninistta1ion’s plan to tattoo-

barcodes on people’s butts so that the smart toilets
could keep t1ad< of people’s locations Though the
book is ﬁctional, North set the story during Ford’s

presidency because current vice president Dick T

Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and President George
Bush, Srwotkedfor Ford.

‘an thewaythtough the book, there’s this really
silly plot. It’s fun, but it’s really  Andthen, when
yougetto t:heencl,yourealizedwe’repastthat,” said
North. “We’repastthat. It’s worse thanthat” '

mitted overthepasteightyearsisthedecisionto
take military action in  o .

Following the Sept. 11 attacks, I, like much
of the rest of the country, was in shock and

wanted to seek revenge against the perpetra-
tors of such monstrous crimes. Yet seven years

later,withthe events of Sept. 11 still freshinthe .

minds of so many Americans, the United States
is engaged in a war built not upon the terroristic

" acts committed against this nation, but on false

pretenses and forged documents

Moreover, rather than  substantial
progress on the war on terror, Bush launched
an immoral and preemptive war of aggres-
sion against a nation that posed no immediate
threat to the security of the United States and
was not connected with the events of Sept: 11.
Ultimately, Bush exploited the Sept 11 attacks
as an opportunity to justify

column. Additionally, Scooter Libby, who served
as Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, also spoke to

- reporters about Plame’s identity and was later

convicted of obstruction of justice and 

Although Bush himselfdid not directly dis-
close the name of \V1lson’s wife, his administra-
tion fostered a culture of  and deceit not
only throughiits continued use of 
reasons for the Iraq war, but also through delib-
erately  a critic of the administration;

The Bush administration only perpetuated
Washingtzods culture of  deceit and
dishonesty, which has marred American’ politics
since the Nixon administration. Where is the
democratic integrity in refuting an objection to
the policies of the government ~ something
that is aﬂorded to the American people in the
Constitution — by illegally disclosing the name
of the objectJor’s CIA—operative wife? whete
is the integrity in denouncing any objector who
poses a threat to the success and approval of
presidential legislation or, more specifically, awar
founded on false pfetenses?

Throughout Bush’s administration, both
Dick Cheney and Kati Rove spearheaded criti-
cal foreign and domestic policy  spe-
ciﬁcally the Iraq war. Rove particula.rly~was the
mastermind behind the Bush administration’s
combative and secretive nature. Bush has rede-
ﬁned the signiﬁcance that the vice president and
key policy advisers play in governing the United
States, to the level that the president often teiicti
first on the advice of Cheney and Rove prior to
promoting any new legislation ‘'

Even in the wake of the current economic

ciisis, rather  strongly

a preemptive military en-
gagementin Iraq.

In 2003 former US.
Ambassador Joseph C.
Wﬂson wrote an op-ed
piece for the New York
Times titled “What I

administration’s claim that

immoral and

nation that posed no
immediate threat to the
security of the United
States.

engaging the situation duting
the earliest days of the crisis
himself, Bush yet  rel-
egated the role of chief ex-
ecutor to another: Treasury
secretary Henry M Paulson.
Prior to‘becoming presi-
dent, Bush served as the gov-

destruction, which was one of the main reasons

 __j for the United States’  engagement in 

F _

Later that year in a W/ashington Post column
by Robert Novak, the identity of \V1lson’s wife,
undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame, was
revealed. '

Karl Rove was one of Bush’s most impor-
tant advisers and is often regarded as the archi-
tect of not only  of Bush’s policies and
legislations, but also of the Iraq war. He was also
one of the original sources for the newspaper

being abipartisan leader with
a 70 percent approval 
at the end of his tenure. Rather than continu-
ing his effective bipartisan leadership that he
demonstrated during his time as governor, Bush
is leaving the United States not only 
destitute and engaged in a seemingly endless, un-
necessary war, but also even more divided along
social, political and economic lines

Pitt pofesso teach art

Professor Kenneth Batista in his studio in Thaw Hall.

by Kathryn Beaty
Staff Wrrter

Sure they can teach, but can they
create?

The artwork on display now at
the Department of Studio Arts 2008
Faculty Exhibition, an exhibition that
occurs every two or three years, in-
cludes the most current pieces from
14 professors The work ranges from
second-hand bed sheets that, when
inﬂated with air, become cars, to sil-
ver  prints of hair strands to
textured strips of colored tape.

Many of the faculty members
with artwork in the show often ex-
hibit locally and play a major role in
Pittsburgh’s art scene as well as in
other cities, both nationally and in-
ternationally. -

‘Two professors, Professor Mi-
chael Morrill and Professor Ken-
neth Batista, talked to The Pitt News
about the artwork they have in the
faculty exhibition. The work of both
professors shares many characteris-
tics in terms of process and inspira-

tion, and they had a lot to say about .

“I take the photograph and I

run it through Photoshop,” said
Batista, “which breaks it down
in pixels From there, I push and
pull the colors. I’m dealing a lot
with color transition and light.”

He uses acrylic paint to transfer
the manipulated photograph onto
the canvas. Morrill also often uses
computers as a basis for his artwork.
Morrill’s paintings in the exhibition
are black and white  formed
by the application of many layers of
paint, and they explore the relation-
ship between light and dark.

For both professors, computers
and the increased speed of the world
today are two of the most powerful
inﬂuences on their work and on the

art world in general.

“I would say that there’s beerqwy,

acceleration in the art world these
days,” said Morill, who has exhibited
for 28 years now. “Young people are
exhibiting work at a much younger
agethanartistsdid30or40years
ago. I think the idea of a long-term
evolution is getting somewhat com-

pressed.”

'Ghostgirl' author a proud Pitt grad

by Sarah Simkin
Staﬂ Wrtter

It’s easy to be miserable in 
school. ‘

Even worse than the stress of
academics and athletics, friendships
and would-be romantic relationships
is the pressure to fit in, to mask your
individuality and conform to cliches
in the hopes of  noticed and
liked. . ,

And it’s only that much harder if
you’re dead. '

Or so proposes “Ghostgirl: Rest
in Popularity,” a new novel by Pitt
alumna Tonya Hurley. '

“Ghostgirl” is the story of Char-
lotte, a  whose entire life revolves
around the desire to be liked by the
in-crowd and, more specifically,
Damen, the classic school heartthrob.

She seems close to achieving (or be-
ginning to start the  stages of
achieving) that goal when she scores
the envied role of Damen’s physics
lab partner, only to choke on a gum-
my bear and die moments afterward.
Following her ignominious death,
Charlotte must attend a  school
that is not as hellish as regular 
school is for most people In this
purgatory for the souls of unresolved
teenagers, she studies “Deadiquette”
alongside her ghostly peers. \V1th
both the aid of Scarlet, a  
who allows Charlotte to possess her,
and the hindrance of Prue, a dead 
with an irrational hatred of Charlotte,
she must discover and resolve her
own issue i
The book, which debuted at No.
10 on the New York Times bestseller

list, is targeted pnmatily at the preteen A

girl demographic but makes an enter-
 for anyagegroup
with its abundance of Halloween-
ﬂavored death puns and teen angst
satire.

latest album is called Murrfor Preiidem‘, and it
sees the rapper take on the political side of
an often—bland genre on his own terms. Murs

sets you apart from mainstream rappers?

Murs: I’m just smarter, you know? I’m
smarter and a nicer person.

TPN: How do you think your newest album,

ous albums?

Murs: It’s a lot more message—driven, and
the sonic quality of it is a lot higher. It’s like
going from a home video to the big screen,
sonically.

that time in the studio, is it nice to be back

her eyes back to Pittsburgh for inspiration.

“The Passion is a team with a great mission
about teaching life lessons through sports,” com-
mented Yee “When I had the resources, I knew I
wanted to make a ﬁlm about thern”

The Philadelphia native went into the project
with the simple mantra of  the story and
doing justice to the people the story is about”
Then the unexpected happened: The Passion
went undefeated (12-O), obtained its first playoff-
berth and won the championship in remarkable
fashion by blanking the Columbus Comets, 32-0.

“We didn’t anticipate the success of the team,”
said Yee “We followed the whole season, never

expecting to go undefea ”

Teresa Conn, owner and cohead coach of
the Passion, called Yee an  yourlg lady”
and worked  with her on the documen-
tary. ‘The stories shea ﬁlms are so inspirational,”
said Conn “We were more than happy to have
her share our story and mission with the woti .”

Even though Conn played for two years as
a free safety for the Passion, she adamantly pro-
fessed that the Passion is more than a women’s
football team “We bring together women from
alldifferentwalks of life andteachthemtlobein—
tertlally strong You get knodzed down, and then
you stand back up.” i

Players of the Passion pulvetize opponents on
the ﬁeld, but they do their part for the community
olf of it Through the Passion for Life Founda-
tion, the team found itself  its vision of
teaching valuable lessons of  through edu-
cational outreach programs that feature athletes in
the classroom, motivational  and public
service media production.

‘The city of Pittsburgh and its fans made this
team a success through a huge group effort,” said
Conn. ‘These philanthropic events are our way
of  the city”

Art‘ professors display their own Wor

F acutly, page 29
4 Batista explains that the computer is also

creating a sense of fragmentation in our cul-
ture, because anyone can go to the computer at
any time of night or day to ﬁnd out anything.
Batista likes to combine the traditional artistic
processes with technology to combat its speed.
“Working with oil paint is a very slow, old
process,” said Batista. “It slows me down; it
slows the world down for me.”

_Both professors agree that increased tech-
nology and globalization have also inﬂuenced
how students learn about art because it chang-
es how they View the world  how

to create art is different from the days when
classical Renaissance masters used to teach
students precise skills for painting ﬁgures and
perspective in their studios or the Irnpression—
ists gathered together in Paris to discuss the
movement; I

“I have no interest in creating a school of
abstraction or something like that,” said Mor-
rill. “I’m really interested in setting a condition,
stage or atmosphere in the studio where stu-
dents can probe and ﬁnd their own ideas”

Batista does not try to persuade the students
to create one type of work, but rather provides

I a_ base level of skills upon which they can apply

their own interests and build their work.
Batista sees a very ﬂuid relationship between

the classroom and the creation of artwork
“Teaching and working in the studio are

very different energies that require different

"parts of you,” said Batista. “The energy I put

out in the classroom I get returned from the
students and, in turn, I take to the studio. The
energy I get out of working in the studio, I take
into the classroom, so it’s a very nice balance.”
Both Morrill and Batista say they appreciate

k on campus

dents brings into the studio. They say that this
keeps them interested and fascinated in what’s
going on in the world today.

“One of the nice  about teaching
here, and this is why I came to the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh, is that it’s a BA. program,”
said Batista, “which means a number of our
students come from different disciplines. You
could have a freshman in an undeclared major
sitting next to a‘ graduate student in molecular
biology that’s  the class to get his or her
head out of his dissertation  everywhere in
between.”

Ghostgirl, page 29

in the ’90s,  with fond memories of
the Original Hot Dog Shop and  in Hol-
land Hall.

Hurley originally conceived of theghostgirl
concept as a TV show, later going on to write
a feature ﬁlm script. \While a ﬁlm is not entirely
out of the question, ghostgirl (dead girls’ names
aren’t capitalized) is  in print for now, in ad-
dition to her home at ghostgirlcom, an interac-
tive Web site created long before the book.

The book is set up with brief introductions
to each chapter that serve both as synopses of
the coming plot developments and mini philo-
sophical essays. Hurley said that she originally
wrote them as character development exercises
and then decided to work them into the format
of the novel.

Hurley hopes that the messages of personal
responsibility and the occasional necessity of
sacriﬁce come across to her readers.

“The whole book actually is about staying
true to yourself and acceptance. Feeling invisible
starts in high school, but it goes throughout life,”
said Hurley. “In the real world, when you get out

‘ of high school, it’s your differences that propel

you and that bnng success, that are celebrated.”

Pitt looks fo

by Alex Oltmanns

For The Pitt New I
Riding a ﬁve-game winning
streak and fresh off a convincing
21-point win over Navy, the Pitt

football team is suddenly living up _

to  the hype that surrounded the
team this offseason, as it is current-
ly ranked No. 17 in the ﬁrst Bowl

Championship Series rankings.

The next task for the Panthers
(5-1, 2-0 Big East) are the Rutgers

-»"iScarlet Knights (2-5, 1-2 Big East),

a team that has a three—game win-
ning streak against Pitt. The two
teams square off on Saturday at
3:30 p.m. at Heinz Field.

The teams last met Nov. 17,
when Pitt lost a tough game at Rut-
gers, 20-16, in which Oderick Turn-
er’s touchdown was called back for
offensive pass interference on what
would have put the Panthers ahead
late in the game.

This has been a tough season
for the Scarlet Knights and head
coach Greg Schiano. They strug-
gled through their nonconference
schedule, going 1-3, with the only

win coming against Division -1-AA
Morgan State. Rutgers is looking
to string two wins together for the
first time this season, coming off a
tight 12-10 win against Connecti-
cut.

“Rutgers may be the best two-
win team in the country."

Dave ’ 
Wannstedt

Rutgers is a program that has
experienced a, resurgence under
Schiano, going to three straight
bowl games after being tradition-

ally regarded as one of the worst 0

programs in Division I.
Rutgers fifth-year. quarterback

and team leader Mike Teel has

struggled, -along with much of the
rest of the team so far this season.

Yet, despite their record, Pitt coach
Dave Warmstedt knows the Scarlet
Knights are still a formidable op-
ponent.

“Rutgers may be the best two-
win team in the country,” said
W/annstedt. “W/ith. them winning
the game [against Connecticut], I
think it was a very big momentum
boost.” I
_ Warmstedt stated that the Pan-
thers have to_be ready for what Rut-
gers will throw at them on defense.

That defense is led by linebackers.

Ryan D’Imperio and Kevin Malast,
who is currently second in the Big
East in tackles. i

“Defensively, I think personally
they’re playing as good as any de-
fense I’ve had a chance to war ,”
said Warmstedt. “They do a lot of
movement — they pressure you a
lot.”

For that reason, it is essential

that the offensive line continues to '

play well, a ‘trend that \X/annstedt

has been pleased with recently.
“They seem to be playing bet-

ter and better each‘ week,” said

Same Kn

by Lauren Kirschman I
Staﬂ WrL'[er

Think back on the paramount I

moments in recent Pitt men’s
basketball history. L

Whether it’s the Big East

regular season title in 2002. or '

the Panthers Big East tourna-
ment crown last year, there's a
common factor appears in every
highlight: Brandin Knight.
Widely accepted as one of

the most accomplished players’

in Pitt basketball history, Knight
played for the‘ Panthers from
1999-2003. During that time, the

former All-American and Big,

East Player of the Year guided
the team to an 89-40 record, in-
cluding a 57-11 mark in his final
two- seasons .— seasons that initi-

ated the implausible turnaround"

of Pitt basketball.
His abilities and guidance
were instrumental in the creation

of _ the basketball powerhouse '

thriving in Oakland today.
But- his story at Pitt didn’t end

there. i
The player credited with Pitt’s
basketball’ resurgence returned
to,Pitt as a video coordinator in
2006. After serving as the direc-
tor of basketball operations last
season, Knight looks to lead the
Panthers from a new perspective
this year as an assistant coach. He

9 received the promotion over the

summer, after ‘ex-Pitt assistant
Orlando Antigua accepted the
same job at Memphis; '

,_ Knight said thatwith the job
‘change came a change in respon-

-— sibility.

ight, new position *

“The biggest transition is
just getting guys to understand
that my role has changed a lot,”
said Knight. “_I’m not able to
be around as much because of‘
rules.” V

.Often referred to as a coach

. on the floor during his playing , 9

years, Knight said that "his new
position allows him to take on a

leadership role similar to" the one A

he held as a point guard. Howev-

'» er, he made sure to credit the se-

niors for the guidance they offer

"to the relatively_ young Panther‘;
squad. He pointed out that many
of the players on the roster have A

never played a game in the Big
East or at the Petersen Events
Center.

Students Want

homecoming Win

by Randy Lieberman
Staﬁ’ H7/‘its/*

' Homecoming brings with it fliers
pasted in the most bizarre areas of
campus, the entourages of home--
coming court nominees hounding
innocent. students with free candy
and the annual ﬁreworks display in
front of the Cathedral of Learning.

For college football, it also marks
the halfway point in most BCS con-
ference teams’ seasons, a time to look
forward to securing a bowl berth.

For Pitt football, though, the
homecoming game has recently
been the beginning of the end for
these aspirations.

Pitt is a mere 2-8 in games fol-
lowing homecoming the past three
years, and some fans are tired of late
season ﬂops becoming the status
quo in the Pitt football program.

“It sucks,” said junior David Mill-
er. “We always look like we’re going
to get over the hump and make a

bowl game for once. But every year,
that goes right out the door down
the stret 1.” I

It was a similar scene in 2006
when the Panthers looked poised
to pounce into the top 25, facing a
homecoming showdown against
No. 12-ranked Rutgers.

But one run silenced the loud,
hometown crowd at Heinz Field.‘

Ray Rice, the former Scarlet
Knight who is now a Baltimore Ra-
ven, ran .a handoff for 63 yards late
in the fourth quarter to set up the
game-winning touchdown for Rut-
gets.

The Scarlet Knights won, 20-10,
leaving Pitt fans morose and looking
for answers. 4

“I remember him running, and
there was nobody around,” said se-
nior Andrew Ablog. “That loss was
just a joke. It was unbelievably disap-
pointing after all the talk of being
ranked.”

The loss was the first game of a

Chak-Talk

Will Shady stay at Pitt in '09?

by Zack Chakan
Aaaiatiz/zt Sparta E3£tor

I’m horriﬁed of LeSean Mc-
Coy right .now.

No, he didn’t buy a Jigsaw
mask for Halloween or appear in

' that creepy DirecTV commercial

with the dead girl from “-Polter-
geist.” Something far scarier.
McCoy’s looking good. Like,
Big East Offensive Player of the
Year good. Or Heisman Trophy

good, had he gotten off to a bet- .

IICI start.

Pitt’s super sophomore run-

ning back enters tomorrow’s
game against Rutgers with
689 yards and 10 touchdowns
through six contests. In the
last three, he’s accumulated 447
yards on only 74 carries, nearly
six yards per rush.

McCoy is on pace for 1,37.8
yards for 2008, an improvement
over last year, and 20 touch-

 

- downs. If his torrid stretch con-

tinues, he could top 1,500 yards.
So, what’s so bad about that?
I’m worried McCoy will dis-

‘ appear — to the NFL Draft,

that is.

McCoy has legitimate pro-
fessional athleticism, skill and
instincts. He combines fantastic
speed with pure toughness in the
trenches, and of course, those

patented fake—the-defender-out-

of-his-sneakers moves.

As Pitt continues its unex-
pected ascension to the peak
of the Big East, McCoy’s draft
stock climbs right beside it. And
if McCoy leads the Panthers to
a conference‘ title and a BCS
berth, scouts. and fans alike will
see his rare talent on the national
stage. 4

Imagine this scenario:, Mc-
Coy rushes for more than 1,000
yards as Pitt wins its ﬁnal six
games, including a decisive vic-
tory over West Virginia in the

team’s home ﬁnale. He notches

10 more touchdowns to give him
an incredible 1,700 yards and 20
scores on the year.

V Then McCoy torches Virgin-
ia Tech in a BCS bowl for 165
yards and three touchdowns. Pitt
ﬁnishes 12-1, and students ﬂip
over a car outside the Cathedral.

Guess what? He’s draft-eligi-g

ble in 2009. And a sure-ﬁre ﬁrst-
round selection — regardless of
Pitt’s record.

Although college sopho-
mores aren’t usually permitted
to enter the NFL Draft, Pitt fans
know all too well the lone exam-
ple of when they can.

That rule wrested away the
best player to don a Panther
uniform in the past two decades
after only two seasons‘ at Pitt:
Larry Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald was the Heisman
Trophy runner-up in 2003, be-
hind Oklahoma quarterback
Jason W/hite. That season, as a

Negrychhitting his Way to majors

Photo courtesy Pete Madi
Former Pitt second baseman Jim Negrych, shown here in a 2006 photo, batted .559 between Lynchburg
and Altoona. in the Pittsburgh Pirates’ minor‘-league system last year. He was a sixth-round pick in 2006.

by Zack Chakan
Amatazit Sparta E3[tor

When a baseball player bats .359
in the major leagues, he’s considered
a bona-ﬁde star.

When one hits .359 in the minor
leagues, he’s labeled a prospect. He’s
noticed. ’

Jim ‘Negrych accomplished ex-

. actly that this season.

Negrych, a Pitt alum, put up re-
markable numbers in his third minor
league season in the Pittsburgh Pi-
rates’ system. He spent most of the
year with the  Class—A Lynch—

"  burg Hillcats before being promoted '
to the Altoona Curve in late July.

The 23-year-old dominated
C]ass—A,  .370.with 36 doubles,
ﬁve home runs, 62' RBIs and 55
walks in 386 at—bats.

He didn’t slow down much after
moving up the organizational ladder.
In only a month at AA Altoona, Ne-
grych batted .310.

All this grabbed the Pirates’ at—

tention. After the successﬁtl year, the
team sent Negrych to compete in the
Hawaii Wmter League, where he has
already started the season.

He joins a few other touted Pi-
rates prospects, including the club’s
top minor league shortstop, Brian
Friday.

“So far, it’s been really good.
There are’ a bunch of really good
players down here,” said ‘Negrych.
“It’s just an opportunity to play an
extra month out of the year.”

Along with San Francisco Giants
farmhand Ben Copeland, Negrych
looks to break Pitt’s rnajor-league

" drought‘-. The last former Panther to

reach the majors was outﬁelderjason
Conti, who played in parts of five
seasons from 2000-04.

In fact, only ﬁve Pitt baseball al-
ums have played m the majors. Ne-
grych could be the sixth.

The talent Negrych displayed
both on and off the baseball ﬁeld
was evident when former Pitt assis-
tant coach Dan Ninernire recruited

championship might have given him more
satisfaction.

“I55 kind of like watching your kids ﬁ-

“It’s a little more rewarding sometimes
from this side because you get to watch it
and see how happy it makes all of them.”

Not long ago, Knight and his teammates
made up some of the most accomplished
teams in Pitt basketball history. Despite
that, he doesn’t want the current players to
concern themselves with the past. He tells
them to concentrate on this season.

“My thing is just trying to get them to

game in and game out, and forget about the
bad stuff.”

The left—handed  Negrych attracted
the attention of Pittsburgh scouts, who were
able to watch him play locally. The Pirates ended
up  him in the sixth round of the 2006
MLB Draft after his junior season.

“It felt good [being drafted by the Pirates] ,”
said Negrych. “I went to a lot of games there. I
love it, it’s my favorite place to be after Buffalo.
Just to be drafted by that team and knowing
what they have in the organization, it’s a feeling
that really can’t be expressed in words.”

Jordano was happy with Pittsburgh’s interest
in his second baseman.

“I was very pleased when the Pirates drafted
Jimmy,” said Jordano. “I was always perplexed
why more of our guys had not been drafted by
our hometown team. Being a life—long Pirate
fan, it was great for me and Jimmy.”

Negrych, a second baseman by trade, played
third base for much of 2008. But the organiza-
tion plans to move him back to second base for
the upcoming season.

Negrych is one of only two upper—tier pros-
pects the Pirates have at second base. The other,

Shelby Ford, was drafted three rounds ahead of
Negrych in 2006 and manned the position for
Altoona this year.

Ford, who has battled injuries throughout
his minor-league career, might move up to
AAA Indianapolis, which would place Negrych
as Altoona’s starting second baseman.

Regardless, Negrych is sure to be starting
somewhere. ,

“Right now, I’m playing a little more second
base in Hawaii,” said Negrych. “Being able to
play third base is something to keep myself ver-
satile to be able to play anywhere.”

Negrych almost immediately started at third
base this year in Lynchburg. \X71th his position
set, his offensive production exploded.

He never stopped hitting, hovering around
.370 throughout the summer months. Despite
the high average and number of doubles, the Pi-
rates kept Negrych in Lynchburg, citing a need
to improve on one more aspect of his game

That attiibute is defense.

“I have to try to get better all—around at de-
fense,” said Negrych. “Whether it’s at second
base or third base, whether it’s my footwork or
my hands or my throwing motion, I just have to
clean up a lot of things.”

By the end of July, Negrych had nothing left
to prove at Lynchburg. The Pirates promoted
him to Altoona, where he played every day and
continued to hit above .300.

Negrych’s ﬁne season placed him on numer-
ous prospect watch lists for the Pirates. Many
experts rate him among the franchise’s top—20
minor leaguers. A duplicate next year at Altoona
could lead to a promotion to Indianapolis, or
even Pittsburgh.

He certainly has support from Jordano.

“I believe Jimmy will need to improve him-
self defensively and possibly switch positions to
make it,” said Jordano. “I know his bat will play
at the major league level. They just need to ﬁnd
a position for him. I have no doubt he will get
there.”

Rutgers‘ receivers could
’ pose problems for secondary

Football, page 39

But \Y/annstedt is fully aware that
Rutgers has plenty of veteran lead-
ers of its own who know how to
win.
“I think with their experience,
it’s surprising that they only have
two wins,” said Warmstedt. “It’s
also what makes [Saturday] such a
dangerous and important game.”
Along with quarterback Mike
Teel, halfback Kordell Young and
receivers Kenny Britt and Tiquan

Underwood also lead the Rutgers

T offense.

Young has been injured much

of this season with knee problems
but has gotten the majority of the
team’s carries in its last two games.
He is trying to fill the void left by
workhorse Ray Rice, who declared
for the NFL Draft after his junior
season last year.

Britt has been a bright spot all
season, amassing 46 receptions
for 571 yards in only six games.
Underwood, a first team All-Big
East selection last season, has been
struggling to duplicate his strong
statistics from la season ago, but
Warmstedt is fully aware of the

threat that he and Britt provide.

“Britt and Underwood are as
talented as we’ll see all year long,”
said Warmstedt. ‘‘_\We’re talking
about both of those guys playing
on Sunday at the next level.”

While the renewed midseason
buzz surrounding the Panthers is
nice, Warmstedt knows there are
still a lot of games yet to play and
that they can’t afford to overlook
anyone.

“It’s nice for the University,”
said \Y/annstedt “[But] they don’t
hand any trophies out in October.”

Game Notes

All-Time Series
Pitt has beaten Rutgers 19 out of 25 times in the program's history.

Compiled by Rob Meier

Pitt Offense vs. Rutgers Defense

In its past two Big East games, the Rutgers defense has allowed only 23
points —- tied for the fourth lowest back-to-back game total in its history of
Big East play. However, the Scarlet Knights will be facing a Pitt offense that
has put up 68 points in its last two games.The unit that continues its streak
of dazzling play may decide the winner of the game.

Battle on the Mental Front
Rutgers is 0-3 this year when it commits more penalties than its opponents.
It will be facing the most disciplined team in the nation this week in terms

of penalties. Pitt ranks ﬁrst nationally in fewest penalties per game (3.33) .

and fewest penalty yards per game (23.17).

Schiano's Run Defense Dominance

Rutgers coach Greg Schiano is facing a huge task against the Panthers on
Saturday. In seven career games against Pitt, his defense has held the Pitt
rushing attack to only 622 yards on 250 attempts —just 2.5 yards per carry.
The Pitt offense this year has 1,001 yards rushing on 236 rushing attempts
— a solid 4.2 yards per carry. ‘

Star Bursting

One of the motivational speeches in the locker room for Rutgers this week
will most likely concern shutting down another running back in the na-
tional spotlight. Last week against Connecticut, Rutgers held the nation's
leading rusher, Donald Brown, to 107 yards on 27 carries. In the second half,
Brown was limited to only seven yards. The Scarlet Knights will look to halt
another ﬂashy running back, LeSean McCoy,‘in his tracks. McCoy-recently

cracked Pitt's all—time top—1 O rushing list and top-15 scoring list.

Pitt hopes
to avoid
late collapse

Homecoming, page 5 7

hellacious stretch that ended the year.

The Panthers subsequently lost their last
four games to South Florida, Connecticut, West
Virginia and Louisville to ﬁnish 6—6 for the year.
The Panthers missed the bowl gamecut 

This brings us to this year’s eerily similar
rnatchup at: Heinz Field.

The hype is there. ESPN.com Big East
blogger Brian Bennett named Pitt the “team to
beat” in the Big East the rest of the way, and his
colleague Mark Schlabach picked Pitt to win the
Big East and advance to a BCS bowl game.

Is this the year that homecoming is a spring-
board instead of a brick wall in Pitt’s quest to
capture its first Big East title under \X/annstedt?

“I think this is it I’m keeping the fai ” said
senior Tim Newman. “It has to be the year.
Wannstedt is ﬁnally playing with his recruits and
stuff, so this is his team. He should win with
his team.”

Panthers coach Dave Wannstedt isn’t con-
vinced Rutgers will go down quietly. Earlier this
week, he said in a press conference that Rutgers
might be the best two-win team in the country,
citing Rutgers’ upset over UConn last week.

“He can say that, but he knows that we
should beat them,” said Newman of Warmst—
edt’s comments. “It’s sort of like they had a
couple good years, but Rutgers is back to play-
ing like Rutgers again.”

As much as the Panthers have struggled af-
ter homecoming games, the team is a solid 2-1
in its last three homecoming games, with a win
against Syracuse in 2005 and last year’s upset
over Cincinnati.

No matter the outcome, the majority of Pitt
fans are optimistic about the game this year.
And they’re hoping the second half of the sea-
son will resemble the first.

Knight doesn't Want hype to get to Panthers

Knight, page 40
“because none of those things matter.”

Knight mentioned that he isn’t far re-
moved from the current players, knowing
many of them since his playing years. He
still understands what it’s like to be a play-
er, including dealing with the pressure and
expectations.

“On paper, I can say that all the rank-
ings are great,” said Knight. “But at the
end of the year, I want to be ranked on
top. I want to end our season with a win.”

This preseason, college basketball ex-

perts ranked the Panthers nearly unani-
mously in the nation’s top 10.

“Every year is a new year and it’s dif-
ferent,” said Knight. “You never know

what it’s going to be like in a game until

it’s played.”

Every year is different, but Knight
seems to be the familiar thread holding
them all together.

Just five years ago, Knight played his
last season in a Pitt jersey. He had a short
stint in the NBA before injuries sent him

45

 i

out. Now he stands on the brink of his ,
first season as an assistant coach for the "
program he helped guide into a golden
era.

And it almost seems as if Pittsburgh
basketball without Brandin Knight
wouldn’t be Pittsburgh basketball at all.

“This place has been like home for me
for the past nine years,” said Knight.

And although he’s had success here in
the past, he’s hoping his best days are yet
to come. i

iMcCoy will be high pick in next draft



I ,

_Cha.kan, page 37

sophomore, Fitzgerald caught 92 passes
for 1,672 yards and 22 touchdowns. How
he lost that award is still baffling.

Pitt fans were gearing upto see at least
one more year of Fitzgerald in blue and
gold until he declared for the NFL Draft.
Just like that, Fitzgerald was picked third
by the Arizona Cardinals.

You see, Fitzgerald was a sophomore,
but it was his third year away from high

school. He spent one year at Valley Forge
Military Academy, a prep school. This al-
lowed Fitzgerald the ability to become a
pro, as NFL rules state that any player
drafted must be three years removed from
high school.

McCoy ﬁts the same standards. He
spent 2006 at Milford Academy before
coming to Pitt.

Currently, Scouts Inc. rates McCoy as

the 25th best prospect for next year’s draft.
That’s third out of all running backs. If he
continues to tear apart Big East defenses,
he surely will rise. A

McCoy will have a decision to make.
Should he stay, or should he go?

The Panthers will be in some trouble
if he turns pro. LaRod Stephens—Howling
will be gone as well. That would leave
Shariff Harris, Kevin Collier, Chris Burns

and a possible freshman to inherit the
rushing load in 2009. A
There’s not a lot of experience in that

. group. Unless one breaks out in a big way,

Pitt will need to rely on Bill Stull or Jona-
than Baldwin for offensive ﬁreworks next
year.

Of course, none of this makes a dif-
ference now. And it’s not like McCoy says
he’ll go. Right now, he seems focused
on the season. He seems focused on the
team.

McCoy needs to be at the top of his
game for Pitt to be successful and churn
out victories. Anything less, and the Pan-
thers could easily slip in their quest for the
conference title. Pitt has no choice but to
go all out to win this season, as evidenced
by coach Dave \X/annstedt’s questionable
decision to break Pat Bostick’s redshirt
against Navy.

Unfortunately,

Pitt’s and McCoy’s

triumphs could come back to bite the
program later. McCoy could very easily
choose to come back and help Pitt to the
top in 2009. ‘

But one thing’s for sure: The NFL will
have more to offer Shady than just candy.
