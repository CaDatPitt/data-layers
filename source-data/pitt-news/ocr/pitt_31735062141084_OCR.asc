School Plan
Urgetl by US

By PAUL PFISCHNER

College and university students

are needed more by the world today

than at any other time in the his-

tory of civilization, according to
‘ Dr. Frank W. Shockley, director of "
 the summer semester.

The United States government
has asked the institutions of higher
learning to give students an oppor-
tunity to continue their education
during the summer to increase the ‘
output of college students, he said,
stressing three factors concerning
the summer semester:

1. The technical training which
college students receive is needed
now, not only to win the war but
to help in post-war reconstruction.

2. The majority of college stu-
dents who are called into service
before they graduate will not re-
turn for their degree after the war
is over. They havebeen out of con-
tact with college and have grown
older. The incentive for college has
left them. _

3. In later life the person who
has not completed his degree will
regret it. Dr. Shockley gave nu-
merous incidents of men who did
not complete their degree before

the last war and “They have deep-
ly regretted it," he asserted.

“These factors all point to one
thing,” Dr. Shockley said, “that the
college student must complete his
education before he is of military.
age, 20.” ’

“A student should not feel that
he is not doing his duty by not
ﬁghting in the’ front lines. He
should realize that highly trained
and educated personnel are needed
to win this war, and the only way
to get this type of person is to edu-
cate him in the university,” Dr.
Shockley said.

Father Paul J. Rock, chaplain to
the Catholic student body of the
University and moderator of the
Newman club of Pittsburgh, died
Friday at the home of his sister,
Mrs. ‘Harry J. Buerkle, of 192‘ Rich-
barn street, North Side.

Funeral services will be con-
, ducted this morning at 10 o'clock
at St. Paul’: cathedral. Friends
were received at the Cathedral rec-
tory, l08 North Dithridge street.
Burial will take place at St.
Joseph's cemetery, Bellevue road,
West View.

Father Rock was a ‘cum laude’
graduate of the University’s School
of Dentistry in 1926, and was or-
dained in 1937 at Mt. St. Mary’s
College and Seminary, Emmitsburg,
Maryland. He also attended the
Pittsburgh academy ‘ and Duquesne
university. He was born in Pitts-
burgh on December 17, 1893.

‘A machine gunner in the first
World War, he was given the
French Decoration and the Purple

Heart for bravery under ﬁre and
meritorious service.

Father Rock was appointed chap-
lain of the Catholic. students of the
University ‘and of Carnegie Tech
in 1937 by,Bishop Hugh C. Boyle,
who wished a greater interest de-
veloped’ in the Newman club -and
the Carnegie Catholic student
group. A

Father Rock's interest in young
people, his teaching ‘experience at
the Pittsburgh academy and Mt.
St. Mary’s college; his specialized
ﬁeld, social science, and his varied
career made him an ideal counselor
for such groups.

Faculty Mean W/an ts Revenge

For Ruin of Fatlier’s Statue

Dr. Waclaw Szymanoski is one member of the Pitt faculty who '

really has reason for wanting to be younger. He would like to have the
" is chance to ﬁght in the US army, and it would be a ﬁght of revenge.

Just recently the great statue of
Chopin » in the heart of Warsaw
was destroyed. It was not just an-
other statue from Dr. Szymanoski’s
point of view——-it was the greatest
achievement of his father's life. ~
‘He can remember how his father
worked to symbolize all the heroism,
greatness,and sadness in Chopin’s
face. ' ~

«He camremember when, in 1926,
musicians from all over Europe
came to Warsaw for the unveiling
of that statue. And he still has the
‘picture taken of his father after

the statuewas completed. He can 1'

see the expression of contentment
in that photo. ‘

Mrs. Szymanoski’s father was

newspaper which was deﬁnitely
.anti-Nazi. A

Dr. Szymanoski wishes he were,

younger.

Event Sclietlule
Shows Changes B

As plans for the eighteenth an-
nual. Spring festival near comple-
tion, the result of telescoping the
events from a, week to two days,
due to the accelerated program, is
noticeable. ’ - _

Unlike last year, tﬁrevwill be
no review of the ROTC, no open
house at the women's fraternities,
and no special athletic events, ex-
cept track day, but as many‘ events
as possible have been scheduled
during April 16 and 17.

ion Thursday afternoon‘, April

16, a sports jamboree, consisting‘

of a track meet and some novelty
events will take place in Pitt Sta-
dium. Thursday night will be Car-A
nival night from 8 to All o’clock in
Lilly Court, with booths decorated
on a Mother Goose theme. ‘ ’
Tap Day will be conducted Fri-
day morning. New groups which
will tap for the ﬁrst time this year
are Panther club and‘-wo1nen of the
sophomore class. ' J
Friday afternoon students will
seelthe combined ROTC and float
parade. The ﬂoats also will follow
the Mother Goose theme in their
decorations. Immediately after the
parade will be the Interfraternity
sweepstakes, on Bayard street.
The last event on the Festival
calendar will be the informal
Spring-Swing dance from 9 to 1
o'clock at the Schenley hotel.

.. ;‘‘Students Doubtful of Reasons for War”..
A a/Pitt News headline, March, 1942} in the
I midst of the greatest crisis in American his-
 tory. If the students of America don’t know
what they are ﬁghting for, then it seems to
-me that they have missed- the whole point and
the whole value of their education——and that
the Nazi evaluation of American culture may
-be wholly correct.

Here at Pitt there is an academic aloof-
» ness from the war, many students and.fac-
ulty members alike viewing it as an ex-
ternal eruption that needsto be studied,
‘analyzed, discussed, and possibly solved in
neat -historical patterns. -The post-War'I
A hangover is evident in the four per cent who
still think we’re ﬁghting “for England,” or
the ten per cent who think_ we’re ﬁghting for
m‘.‘economic reasons.” 0 ’
 If "it is reasons the American student
 . o‘ c I _
cg First of an: we are ﬁghting forthe right
to have change, the principle of an enlighten-
‘ed, free people able to guide its own destiny.
However dynamic the fascist states may

seem, it is the democracies that have been
the real dynamic forces in history.

An Axis victory would freeze the whole
poisonous system of elite classes, secret po-
lice, intolerance,‘ andicontempt for the free-
:. dom of the individual. An allied victory
 . would be the green light for continuing ‘pro-

t gress in our social relations. Very deﬁnitely
an Axis victory would end that progress as
it hasialready ended it for three hundred
million men and women——and students-—in
1'5 other countries ‘

V Secondly, I’d like; to mention a reason for
-ﬁghting that comes not so much from_the
mind as-from the heart. It is the American
tradition, stripped of all its halo a.nd senti-
ment, stemming from the pioneers and Immi-

Back from Harrisburg’s Intercollegiate Conference

 elegation of twenty.

\' They left behind them a week-end of war and

peace. planning. Future, engineers and doctors and

-teachers and soldiers talked“ about life in the new

nworld. Their world. They talked about labor, and

‘A housing, and science and. medicine. They discussed’

the aims of education, the way toward a better pub-

Llic health program. ; -

I v They urged the creation of an international gov-

“ ernment. ' ' l

A They traced in retrospect the crumbling of the big
business-isolationist-imperialist-Iaissez faire way of
living and thinking, and projected its decline into

— their plans for the post war, post all war, world. -

' approved the continuation and extension of the func-

tions of labor unions . . . I ’

. . . In Washington, NAM head William Witherow,
presidént of Blaw-Knox Steel Co., appeared before a

grants, inherent in the lives of Washington
and Lincoln, in the lives of Debs and Mooney,
ﬁghting for ‘a better America.

It is a tradition that had and has to ﬁght
against internal greed and waste, and against
:he facists at home as well as the facists
abroad. The American tradition is not hide-
bound ;_it is elastic, its greatness lying in
adaptability to changing conditions.

Lastly, there is a reason for-ﬁghting that
is essential to the fulﬁllment of all the goals
mentioned above: the building of a lasting
peace If ever a generation had’ a chance to
ﬁght the war to end war,.-it is ours. College
students, nurtured in paciﬁsm and passive
resistance, should realize that even peace
hastto be fought for.

~ If only we students could see our own gen-
eration as the one that perhaps in all history
has the greatest chance to stop war by ﬁght-
ing for that chance, then no other reasons
would be needed.

All that has been said above has been said
before, but what was lacking was a compact
presentation of the objectives for which any
intelligent college student, however ration-
al in this thinking, should be willing to lay

down his life.

on the Passing

Of A Priest

We mourn the loss of Father Rock. We
mourn the loss of a’ steady soul in a chaotic
world. , ‘

His was a clear mind, a fresh mind, with
new ideas in an institution older than any

of the civilizations in which it dwells.

In him was embodied a love of right and
a tolerance of wrong. In his ways there was
understanding, and in his words patience.

To the world ofggasoline engines and ﬂy-
ing boats and sea-going leviathans he
brought a sense of stability in timelessness
and of the’ essential sameness of human
problems from one generation to another.

The perplexities facing the student to-

day, he saw, were basically the perplexities

which faced the medieval scholar: th_e enig-
ma. of origin and future, the quest1ons_ of
. whence and whither.

These___ problems he made no attempt to
solve. Rather he emphasized the importance
of recognizing that the problems did exist.

To do so much is to advance the soul of.

mankind by still another step.

One factor which should contribute much to.the~

they ﬁght upon -the side of-_ law and that theirvictory

‘of organized internationallife. Among, the sixty—odd

nation-states th"at‘existed in 1939, practically all of
them subscribed to the doctrines of international law.
Three of them, Germany, Italy, and.Japan, avow-

tion of war ran through the statements of Hitler,"
and thextlapanese militarists. Their actions followed

regards the rules invites ultimate disaster. The wrath
of international community is slow to rise——much
too slow. __ ‘ , ,

At. first the heavily armed 'aggressor.is— met by
only a few half-prepared nations who.stand in his
immediate path. Behind these few, however, is the
community sense ofthe world’s state system, a feel-
ing which has developed rapidly in the Iast’half-
century. As aggression succeeds, sentiments of fear
and anger penetrate throughout the international
community. ,‘ ‘ . ; - '
Finally the society of nations rallies in its poorly

organized might, like a giant posse ‘comitat.us, to de-
molish the law-breaker. It is nota, coincidence that
in both world wars there has been a general inter-
national uprising agai_1_1st a f_ew,aggressors.

The United States now represent acombination of
resources that are greatly superior to those of the

That old thriller of Shakespeare’s,
“Macbeth,” comes for a week’s ap-
pearance at the Nixon, with Mau-
rice Evans (minus Helen Hayes)
and Judith Anderson in the leading

roles of that ﬁendish twosome,

Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. ‘

As for the acting of Mr. Evans
-—well, he doesn’t worry too much
about restraint and ﬁnesse and the
delicate sensitiveness of the mod-
ern audience. He sees the dramatic
moment, piles drama on drama,

blasts forth with pompish rhetoric,‘

and jars the audience into atten-
tion and out of complacency. Mr.
Evans turns on both spigots.

Toned. down ‘and modernized

though the adaptation may be, Mr.
Evans’ personal rendition of the
gory hero in “Macbeth,” is some-
thing like the way Shakespeare
would have wanted it——not too so-
phisticated.

Judith Anderson, of movie fame

as the gloomy Mrs. Danvers in

“Reb'ecca,” plays the also gloomy

wife of Macbeth. From’ murder

_ through to remorse, Miss Ander-

son gives us Lady Macbeth with .a
convincing consistency.

And there are those critics who
I have found Shakespeare's idea of a
dictatorship very timely and perti-

  

Nixon Stage 

nent this season. They sa.y, go see
this new “Macbeth;" it is quite
timely in a sense. However, that’:
propaganda, and Shakespeare
wrote timeless plays, anyway.

But whether or not We choose to
hinge some current-event onto the
story of tragic Macbeth, this pres-
ent rendering of the play is down-
right good drama, and if the"play- 
goer ‘desires unadulterated acting-4’-V
of the both-barrels variety, he
should see the way Mr. Evans and
Miss Anderson do it.

Experienced Mound Corps
Brigiitens Diamond Outlook

Still enjoying the full coopera-
tion of the weatherman, Pitt’s base-
ball team is gradually rounding
into condition for -its April 18th
opener with Bucknell. The squad
took part'~in seven inning practice
games Tuesday, Wednesday, and

' Thursday of last week and coach
V Mitterling was able to get some
- prospectus on his 1942 team.

The pitching has been satisfac-
tory with Joe Will: and Carmello
Ranii leading the mound corps,

bu.t the hitting has been weak. In’

fact the batting has been so bad

that Mitterling set Friday aside for

batting practice only.

No one has turned up to dislodge
Johnny Brown at ﬁ1'st, but there
may be some ﬁghts for the other

Frat Loop Split

positions. Milt Tall and Ed Fisher
have been working out at second
and thus far Fisher seems to hold
the edge.

Third base will see a three cor-
nered ﬁght between Davey Wil-
liams, Jimmy Alcorn, and Fred
Wilmer. John Vaiksnor, last year’:

, shortstop, reported for practice
Friday, but he is going to encoun-
ter some trouble from Bill Kosten-
bauder, who has really been doing
an impressive job of shortstopping.
Davey Williams is also trying out
for the shortstop position.

Nabors, Kable, Abramovitz, and

Zukas have been sharing the catch-

ing chores in the practice sessions
but Zukas seems tagged for first
string honors.

As Swimming Trials -End

A By EARL SURLOFF

Two new records were establish-
ed last Thursday, in the interl'ra—
ternity swimming trials staged in
Trees pool. Herb Venzer, Phi Ep
freshman, set a new mark in the in-
dividual relay when he swam the
event in :37.1. The old record was

, made by Bob Soles in 1940.

Dave Cannon, Pi Kappa Alpha
merman, clipped .4 off the old
100-yard free style mark by cop-
ping the event in :59.l. ' .
Meanwhile Phi Delta Theta, re
cently crowned I-F‘ swimming
champs, led all other fraternities by
getting nine men and two relay
teams into the LF qualifying ﬁnals.

The ﬁnal fraternity trials will be
held tomorrow at 5 o’clock at
Trees Pool.

On the mushball front, Phi Kap-
pa continued on its way toward a
second straight mushball crown by
trouncing Sigma Alpha Epsilon 5-2

in a highly contested battle. The

victory made it two straight for
the Nevillestreet aggregation and
placed them at top of the LF dia-
mond scramble.

Mike Sotak, Phi Kap’s ace hurl-
er, got off to a rather shaky start,
but excellent support in the field
coupled with SAE inability to hit
in the pinches kept him out of
serious difﬁculty.

Led by Bob Bentley and Andy
Patterson, Delta Tau Delta came
from behind in the last inning to
nose out a ﬁghting Phi Ep nine, 9-8.

The Delts jumped off to an early
lead, but the Phi Eps tied the game
in the fourth inning and then went
out in front on Jimmy Deutel-
baum’s round tripper. However,
the Delts were equal to the occa-
sion and won the ball game in the
last inning when Bob Bentley pull-
ed a Frank Merriwell ﬁnish by hit-
ting a home run with one on and
two out. The triumph kept the Delt
slate clean with two victories and
no defeats. '

In the other games on the intra-
mural schedule, Pi Kappa Alpha
nosed out the Phi Gams 2-1 in a
pitcher’s duel, Phi Delta Theta out-
slugged Lambda Chi 15-7, and the
Pi Lams upset the SAM squad, 6-0

War Changes l-M
Mushball Race;

That the war has affected intra-
mural as well as varsity athletics
became apparent last Friday when
director of intramural athletics,
Frank Carver, announced a change
in the :i'raternity mushball league
setup.

Because of the accelerated
school program it is necessary to
divide the Greek circuit into two
divisions. Thus, instead of one big
loop of twelve teams, it is necessary
to have two six-team leagues. The
winners and runners-up in each di-
vision will meet in a playoff series
at the end of the season to deter-
mine the winner of the fraternity
championship. ‘ >

This change, however, does no
aﬂt'ect the independent and engi-
neering leagues. As was originally
scheduled for these two circuits,
they will continue on the round
robin basis.

The ﬁnal playoffs for the intra-
mural mushball. title will be a single

elimination instead of the usual.

double elimination. A draw for
places will determine which team
gets the bye at the close of the sea-
son.

Pitt to Field Team 
”|l All Goes Well". 

Reports coming down from the
football practice ﬁeld seem to in-
dicate that if all goes well Pitt will
have a stronger grid squad this fall
than last season’s ill-fated team.
However, in that little phrase “if

all goes well,” lies the rub.

We are not trying to be alarm-
ists, but it is entirely possible that
Pitt may have to drop football for
the duration, schedule or no sched-
ule. Already the team has surren-
dered a number of players to the
armed forces. Before the opening
whistle blows next September the
biggest part of the outﬁt now en-
gaging in spring drills may be in
the army, navy, marines, or air
corps.

Last week Frank Carver, who
doubles as athletic publicity direct-
or and director of intramural sports,
outlined a tentative first and sec-
ond team. Of course, his analysis

may be changed by what takealw”

place. during the practice session
now being held. ‘

Nevertheless here are Mr. Car-

verls selections. Starting up on the‘, .

line he named Mike Sotak and Bill.
Lohmeyer at the ends; Jack Dar;
ishan and Joe Salvucci "tackles; Bill
Dillon and Vince Antonelli, guards,
and George Allshouse at the cen;
ter post.

01' those seven players only two,
Allshouse and Antonelli, are safe
from the draft. The former is a den-

tal student and will be allowed to 

ﬁnish school, while Antonelli has
been given a 4-F classiﬁcation by
his draft board. All the (rest may
be gone before the season opens.

For his starting backﬁeld Mr.

Carver named Walter West, Bill,-‘fl

Dutton, Jack Stetler and Frank’ '

with the possible exception of Dut-
ton, who is trying to get into the
Naval Reserve.

Todd, Glasser Describe New

First-Aid Course For Women

“This is one of the most far-
reaching and helpful defense move-
ments sponsored at the University
to date,” asserted Marjorie Todd,
and Harriet Glasser assistants to
the dean of women, in an interview
about the first aid course for wo-
men.

' Unlike the home nursing course
which is also open to all Pitt wom-
en, this course prepares the girls
to take care of minor injuries in
the home. They learn the correct
way to bandage the, parts of the
body most frequently injured.
“And they are learning that the
business of bandaging is a. compli-
cated one,” Miss Todd and Miss
Glasser remarked.

The two young assistant deans,
who teach classes themselves, be-
lieve that the lesson in artificial
respiration appealed most to the
170 girls registered in the course.

They said that the pupils are
taught to act quickly, but not so
quickly that correctness is sacri-
ﬁced. “After all,” they added,
“wrong treatment is often more
'dange1‘ous than no treatment at
all.”

and what to do in case of shock
are all part of the first aid pro-

“ gram. The girls practice on each
other and :Miss Todd feels that
each week the results -show im-
provement.

A Red Cross certiﬁcate will be
given to all those who pass an ex-
amination at the end of the course.

“It is a worthwhile course, and
I enjoy teaching it,” Miss Glasser
said. V ' a

coal" Production
Shows Increase

Business in the Pittsburgh dis-‘
trict continued to gain on a broad
front last week, due mainly to bet-
ter-than-seasonal increases in bi-
tuminous coal production, originat-
ing freight shipments, and trade.
The University’s Bureau of Busi-
ness Research reported its index
advanced to 146.5 per cent of the
.1923-25 average, the highest reach-
ed since the ﬁnal week of January.

Steel ingot operating in the dis-
trict reached 97 per cent of ca-
pacity, with one additional blast
furnace being put into operation.
Bituminous coal production was
the highest so far this year, and
increases were reported in both
‘rail and river traffic.

Department store sales rose to
42 per cent ahead of those in the
same week last year. Combined
sales in the 12 weeks ending March
21 were 30 per cent above the ag-
gregate in the like period of 1941.

Higher prices accounted for
about a third of the, gain in dollar
volume, the Bureau explained.
