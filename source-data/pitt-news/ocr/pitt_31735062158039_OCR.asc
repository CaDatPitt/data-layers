Membership Pending for NSA;
SC’s Prom Proposals Clarified

The National Student Association again proposed Pitt
membership in their organization at the SC meeting, Mon-
day, Nov. 1, although this time the NSA,president did not

make an appearance. v

Adoria Smetana, president of the Regional NSA and a

student at Mount Mercy College, gave an impromptu speech,

in the president’s absence, to

persuade the solons to make

the investment of about $173 for regional and national dues

for this year.

The main objections in past

years, to Pitt membership in

N SA were the cost of dues and the expense incurred by rep-

resentatives to NSA conventions. 9

This year’s congress members

again were doubtful as to whether

the cost of’ the conventions, well

over $'5«0'a delegate, would pro-

duce any concrete results.
. Miss Smetana gave -the NSA
publications on student affairs as
an example of constructive ad-
vice offered to NSA members
free of charge. The main func-
tion of the NSA still rests on
the ‘abstract results of the con-
ventions.

Two ‘years ago an MC repre-
sentative charged that NSA had
Communist leanings giving them
a name they found hard to erase.
In spite of a special. conference
last year to clear NSA’s* name,

SC voted down the proposal for
._ membership. ‘

Since the N SA representative
’}

 

spoke after Congress adjourned,

no vote was taken forithis year.
_.But ‘NSA still‘ needs a big uni-
versity name on their roster, and

. look to Pitt’ for an answer to

their problem.

After the meeting Emil Her-
man clarified SC’s position on the
proposed class proms.

He said the idea is rather to
supplement the dance with class
sppnsorship so that each year one
class will have the responsibility.

iOnly one-third of the sen-
iors at Pitt have taken pic-

dio photographer Whit Dela-
plane expressed disappoint-
ment in the small turnout of
seniors in that “they have worked
for four years to the time when
they can graduate.”

He felt that the, book offered
special significancehfor the last
year men because it expresses the
activities and functions held at
Pitt during 1954-55. I

concerning general student par-
ticipation and interest ¢;on‘cern-

first year that pictures. of all
students will appear in the Owl.
In the past two weeks 647 pic-
tures have been taken, “-a very
good number.” ' ,

All photographs are free. Ap-
proximately two weeks after. a
sitting, students will receive
proofs in the mail. They will be
able to choose the one which they.
want to appear in the Owl...» But

students must schedule appoint- , _

ments at the Student Desk for a
sitting.

The innovation of all school
photographs is one of many to be
included in the 19.56 Owl.

A special feature will include

40 color photographs of the

Legends Portrayed in Windows

To Complete Hungarian Room

Two of ﬁve stained glass windows to be installed in the

Hungarian Nationality Room were dedicated on Saturday,

Oct. 30 with ceremonies in the Commons Room.

The windows recount the life of King Matyas I, a great
Rennaissanceking who ruled Hungary from 1458-1490, and
of Francis Rakoczi II, a Hungarian duke who liberated his
province from the rule of the Hapsburgs in the early 18th

century:

- - ’ A.Hungarian present at-the dedication said that if Matyas,

had not died in 1490, he would probably have sponsored Co-

lumbus’ voyage to America.

Dr. Samuel Gormory, chairman of the Hungarian Room
Committee, presided at the dedication meeting. The Matyas -
window was presented by.Mrs. Josef Chesey, treasurer of

the committee.

The Rakoczi window was presented by the Ragoczi
Aid Association of Bridgeport, Conn., represented by Lajos
Varga and Albert Stelkovics, both on the cabinet of the as-

sociation.

Dr. Charles‘B. Nutting, Pitt’s vice chancellor, accepted
the windows on behalf of the‘ University. About the Rakoczi

window, which symbolizes free-
dom, religion, and love of God,
Dr. ‘Nutting stated that it sym-
bolizes “what every university
tries to instill in its students.”
Mrs. Ruth Mitchell, Director

of the Nationality Rooms said
that the longer the rooms re-
main at Pitt, the more import-
ant they will become to young
America.

Second and third in a series of
five planned for the Hungarian
Room, the windows were created

by Louis Diera, Hungarian de-
signer, Milcho ‘Silianoﬂ, Ameri-
can designer, and Howard Wil-
bert, artist in stained glass.

' Elections, both national and local, come once again to
the fore as Pitt’s politicians push for office. To say that it is
the ‘duty of every student to vote would not only be trite
but, in thermain, ineffective. ,_ . .

P . Still, each student is eligible to vote and should take
the necessary ﬁve minutes or so to cast his ballot. In years
past, a large turnout for student elections has been wanting.
Perhaps student disinterest is the basis for the national

apathy‘ which is so evident during congressional elections
and their ilk.

The almost fanatic crusades‘ for political office during

this country’s infancy have faded from the minds of the

populace and are resurrected only in the yellowing pages
of the history books. And then by history students, only a
few of which are interested enough to. thumb the pages
Without thefimpress of an.instructor’s dictates.

For the most part, the ramiﬁcations of elections are good

ones, beneﬁcial to both, the students running for office and

those who support the candidates.‘ But there are certain
offshootswhich, though not physically harmful, are detri-
mentalfrom a standpoint of University ‘reputation.

Last year’s politicing resulted in a somewhat childish
showing by, over eager campaign managers and their lieu-
tenants. ‘Chalk campaign slogans. all but obliterated the
names on ODK and Panther Walks. Posters, most of which
were badly done, sprouted on the walls throughout the Uni-
versity, buildings while the exteriors of the same buildings
bore colored, scrawls which served not to gain Votes but to

 reflect the writer’s immaturity and lack of that elemental

common sense which should possess each. vote getter.

‘' This year’s freshman class has not followed their pre-
decessors in the manner of campaign signs. A wellordere-d
slate of candidates was posted onthe eighth ﬁoor listing all
candidates for freshman class ofﬁces. ‘This not only reﬂects
the good sense of the newcomers but serves to demonstrate

. the proper means by which elections should be approached

in order to achieve‘ the ends for which they are intended.

I‘ A well ordered political campaign serves to add a note
of distinction to the school as well as to the candidate who

A Very Welco

By Jim Deweese

Sometimes it’s‘ what you don’t see that im-
presses you.‘ This was the case last Friday night
as the Pitt Playersstaged their production of Har-
vey, the story of a staggering ﬁgment of imagina-
tion whose goal in life seemed to be making peo-
ple happy.

The ﬁrst impression gained from viewing this

humor brought on by an im-

panionship of Dowd, Elwood P.
and Harvey, six feet, one and
one-half inches of. invisib1e-rab-
bit, who makes up the heart of
Elwood P. Dowd. .

l The world ‘in general and Pitt
in particular could use a" few
more guys like Elwood P. ~Of '

course, he was considered slightly eccentric to say

the least, but in many ways he represented“ the .
most sane and rational ﬁgure in what we accept

as a perpetually troubled world.
In actuality, thereiis no basis for the premise

that the world is on the brink of destruction. In- '

habitants of this tumbling spheroid have assumed
this as a part of their heritage since they stopped
swinging from trees and started swinging at each

Elwood P. Dowd represented the wa1king'an-

walks around in a blue fog, muttering about his
aches and pains and the myriad microscopic trou-

Dowd, with his seemingly naive but understand-

equal respect, from a cab driver whom he has
never met before, to the distinguished head ofa
psychiatric rest home. i To him, there is no sub-

.stance to the superﬂuous snobbery and meaning-

less protocal which dictates. the actions of the
earth's population. He accepts everyone for what
he is, not for what he tries to be. i

‘ Fight For ‘Em,’ Not With ‘Em’

Unwarranied Criticism

They hunch in the stands,
drawling, ungrounded, childish,
and perhaps even jealous, criti-
cism, toward the cheerleaders.
Not even a wink of appreciation
that the four females selected
after long controversy are game
enoughto go through their mo-
tions for K a spiritless jeering
crowd. Now that»Pitt is enjoying
a winning streak, . they have
started to cheer a little, but con-
tinue to deride. ”

It would be frightening enough
to lead a drunken throng of 500

but for the cheerleaders to face a
perfectly sober group of 30,000

which they should not be asked

HOME, SWEET HOMECOMING:

(Author of “Bizrefogt Boy ~With Cheek," etc.) .

A great number of people have been asking me lately, “What is 1

Homecoming?’ Yesterday, for example, as _I walked from my house
-to the establishment of Mr. Sigafoos, the local lepidopterist where
I had left a half dozen luna moths to be mounted —- a distance of no

more than three blocks —- I'll wager that well over a thousand people

stopped me and said, “What is Homecoming?” ‘
Well, what with company coming for dinner and the cookdown
with a recurrence of breakbone fever, I could not tarry to answer

. their questions. “Read my column next week,” I cried to them.

“I’ll tell all about Homecoming.” _With that I brushed past and
raced home to baste the mallard and apply poultices to the cook,
who, despite my unending niinistrations, expired quietly during the
night, a woman in her prime, scarcely 108 years old. Though her
passing grieved me, it was some satisfaction to be able to grant her

last wish—to .be buried at sea-which is no small task when you '

live in Pierre, South Dakota. —
With the dinner guests fed and the cook laid to her watery rest,
I put out the cat and turned to the problem of Homecoming.

First of all, let us deﬁne Homecoming. Homecoming is a weekend
when old graduates return to their alma maters to see‘ a football
game, ingest great quantities of food and drink, and inspect each
other’s bald spots. . .

This occasion is marked by the singing of old songs, the slapping
of old backs, and the frequent utterance of such outcries as “Harry,
you old polecat!” or “Harry, you old_rooster!” or “Harry, you old
ivfiombat!” or “Harry, you old mandrilll" All old grads are named

arry. _ ‘

During Homecoming the members of the faculty behave with

unaccustomed animation. They laugh and smile and pound backs‘

_ ,and_keep shouting, “Harry, you old retriever!” These unscholarly

actions are performed in the hope that the old grads, in a transport
of bonhomie, will endow a new geology building.

The old grads, however, are seldom seduced. By game time on
Saturday, their backs are so sore, their eyes so bleary, and their
livers so sluggish that it is, impossible to get a kind word out of
them, much less a new geology building. “Hmphh!” they snort as
the home team completes a 101 yard march to a touchdown. “Call
that footﬂall? Why, back in" my day they’d have been over on the
ﬁrst down. By George, football was football back in those days-
not this namby pamby girls game that passes for football today.
Why, look at that bench. Fifty substitutes sitting there! Why, in

my day, there were eleven men on a team and that was it. When you '

broke a leg, you got taped up and went ri ht back in. Why, I remem-
ber the big game against State. Harry allaby, our star quarter-
back, was killed in the third«quarter. I mean he was pronounced dead.
But did that stop old Harry? Not on your tintype! Back in he went
and kicked the winning drop—kick in the last four seconds ‘of play,
dead as he was. Back in my day, they played‘ football, by,George!”
Everything, say the old grads, was better back» in their day-
everything except one. Even the most unreconstructed of the old
grads has to admit that back in his day they never had a smoke like
today’s vintage Philip Morris - never anything so mild and pleasing,
day in day out, at study or at play, in sunshine or in shower, on
grassy bank "or musty taproom, afoot or ahorse, at home or abroad,
any time, any weather, anywhere.

I take up next another important aspect of -H’omecoming—the
decorations in front of the fraternity house. Well do I remember
one Homecoming of my undergraduate days. The game was against
Princeton. The Homecoming slogan was “Hold That Tiger!’T Each
fraternity house built z decoration to .reﬂect that slogan, and on
the morning of the gan’i: a group of dignitaries toured Fraternity
Row to inspect the decorations and award a prize for the best.

The decoration chairman at our. house was an enterprising young

man named Rex Sigafoos, nephew of the famous lepidopterist. llrx V’

surveyed Fraternity Row, came back topour house and said, “.111

the other houses are building cardboard cages with ca,rdb'oard ti: . IS -

inside of them. We need to do something different - and I’ve got it.
We’re going to have a real cage with a real ‘tiger insideof it ~ 9.
snarling, clawing, slashing, real live tiger!” 1 1
I “Crikey!” we breathed. “But where- will you get him?”
“I’l1 borrow him from the zoo,’_’ said Rex, and sure enough, he did.»
Well sir, you can imagine what a sensation it was on Home-
coming morning. The judges drove along nodding politely at card-
board tigers in cardboard cages and suddenly they came to our house.
No sham beast in a sham cage here! No sir! A real tiger in a real
cage——a great striped jungle killer who slashed and roared and

All -Winning Buckeyes

Loom as Rose Bowlers

By GENE AROMATORIO

Now that they’ve dissolved West Virginia’s Sugar Bowl
plans, Pitt’s clawing Panthers will attempt to do some rose
picking at the Ohio State campus this Saturday. ,

The Buckeyes, undefeated and untied, are almost a sure
bet for the annual Rose Bowl classic at Pasadena, and a de-
feat at the hands of the Panthers could cause a very unrosy
outlook. 9

Last Saturday the Panthers
handled. th“e role of spoiler to per-
fection as they upset the New
Year’s Day hopes of the Moun-
tineers to the tune of 13-10.
Coach Art Lewis’ young giants
played inpthe Sugar Bowl last
New Year’s Day and-they were
sweet on returning next January
1. The determined Pittites, how-
ever, cannot push the Buckeyes

NICK PASSODELIS
Big gainer against Mounties,

out of bowl picture but they sure
could cause a rumpus.
Practice Of!

As a result of the victory.
Coach Tom Hamilton pulled a
first of the year by calling off
practice Monday ‘afternoon.

This Saturday, though, the task
facing the Panthers is even more
difficult. In Ohio State they will
by meeting a team which owns vic-
tories over Indiana, California,

 

Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and

In last weeKend’s thriller with
the Mounties, the long gains for
the Panthers were supplied by
Corny Salvaterra and Henry Ford
—mostly by air. Salvaterra com-
pleted eight of 16 passes for 105
yards and gained 91 rushing. Ford
snared two aerials for big yardage
and ran a kickoff back to the
Pitt 45.

Kraemer Helps

Another big gainer for the
Panthers was Nick Passodelis who
churned up 55 yards from his
halfback post. The 180-pound
Aliquippa gridder tore through
the huge Mountaineer line for im-
portant yardage on the Blue and
Gold drives.

A big help to Passodelis and the
other backs was senior Eldred
Kraemer who played what was
easily his best game of the year.
The veteran tackle was pitted
against All-American Bruce Bose-
ly and turned in a top-flight per-
formance.

Leading the Skyscraper U. men
thus far, in both the passing and

sensation Salvaterra, who has
quarterbacked in only four games.
' . Leads in Rushing

Glancing at the triple-threat’:
chart shows 16 completions in 42
attempts for 38 per cent. Three
of the tosses were for TD’s--two
coming in Saturday’s fray with
one going to halfback Bugs Baga-
mery and the other to‘ end Fred
Glatz. In rushing, the Wilkes-
Barre product has churned up 190
yards in 46 tries for a 4.1 yard
per carry average.

Minutes from the Mountaineer Massacre:

The meeting was called to order by the referee at 1:30 with a
record crowd in attendance. Right off the bat, the noise was tremendous
because the fans sensed the importance of the contest. Never before
in this little town was so much clamor made at the opening of a game.

Those running the meeting banged at each other for almost 30
minutes before a motion was passed, or rather scored. The motion was
made by Center Dick Donaldson of the West Virginias for a three-
pointﬁeld goal. The motion was passed.

After taking a coffee break, the men ﬁled back into the Stadium
for the ﬁnal half. It was, however, almost the end of thelthird quar-
ter before discussion receded and motions began popping up left and
right.

First it was the Pitts, Corny Salvaterra and Bugs Bagamery
combining, and Bagamery, oddly enough, seconding the motion him-
self by adding the extra point.

Then the Mounties countered with one of theirs. Before anything
could be said, the Pitt Band stood up in mass and asked a point of
of order. “Yea Pitt, ﬁght tenaciou'sly,” they demanded. The point of
order. was refused and the second WVU.motion was passed——ten points
for the home team now. -

The Panther delegation then went into caucus. After coming up
with a plan, they lined up for the kickoff and started ,“Operation
Comeback” by giving Henry Ford enough space to almost reach mid-
ﬁeld’.

Here the visiting delegation appointed Salvaterra chairman of
the above operation and he responded by getting his seven imen up-
front committee to work with himself doing a little here and there.

The Bandnow screamed, “Yea, Pitt, ﬁght furiously,” and sur-
prisingly enough, this point of order was recognized. But now, the
vote. It was close, in fact, it went down to the fourth ballot before
the winner was announced as the eleven from: Pittsburgh.

The Mounties then tried everything to hold off adjoumament but

. the sergeant-of—arms, known in football circles as the ﬁeld judge, soon

closed things with his little whistle and all that was left was the talk
as the delegates left the meeting’ room. "

In the ensuing conversation, the advisor to the Pitts, Tom Hamil-.
ton, told themembers who stayed around to fold up the chairs, that

. he_ thought the difference was in the line play. Just about all agreed

and since everyone was so happy, they thought it would be nice to
honor the Mountie fans with one of the popular songs of the day,
which is also their favorite tune, “Drink, drink, drink.”

In this meet as in the previous:

His time was 26:43.? for the
five-mile course and it was the
fastest time ever run over the
Schenley Park trail.

Coach Olson, though, with-
out denying his proliﬁc runner,
anything, thinks that this year’s
record has been maintained
because of the balance on the
squad.

' He points out that “we’ve’been
winning on the fourth, fifth, and

 

  

rage which was responsible for
their first touchdown.

With ‘just 45 seconds remain-
ing in the second stanza, south-
paw quarterback Dan McCann
threw a 23-yard aerial to E!
Humeston to the State 1'3. And
on the ensuing“ play, McCann
flipped a perfect touchdown strike
to end Karl Gustafson. Charles
Abrachinsky booted _the ‘extra
point and the Panthers led at
halftime, 7-6, since Kent had
scored earlier.

Jim Theodore, breakaway back
from Wilmerding, paced the
Panthers‘ during the third period.
After the locals had moved to the
midfield stripe, Theodore took a
pitchout. swung wide around end,
received two beautiful blocks by
Dick Carr and Fred Guzik, and
rambled 19 yards to the State 30.

_Two plays “later, he hit right

tackle’ for the Blue and Gold's
second touchdown and when
Abrachinsky’s placement was
good, the Panthers led 14-6.
Coach. Steve Petro said, “I was
highly pleased the way our offen-

‘ sive eleven performed, but our

defense will have to be worked
on.”
