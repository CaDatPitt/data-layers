Saudis celebrate
national holiday
in student union

The audience cheered and whistled as
dancers took to the stage and performed
traditional dances to represent different
regions in Saudi Arabia. The performers
wore ﬂowing traditional robes and color-
ful head scarves. _

The men artfully wielded swords and
wooden sticks as they danced in patterns
across the stage while the crowds clapped
in rhythm with their routines.

The dance was part of Monday’s cel-
ebration of the 83rd annual Saudi National
Day, which marks the date that Saudi Ara-
bia became a uniﬁed nation. Members of
Pittsburgh’s Saudi community and the
general public celebrated the holiday in
the William Pitt Union from 5 to 9 p.m.

The Saudi Student House in Pittsburgh,
an organization for Saudi students at 10-
cal universities and colleges that is also
affectionately known as the Saudi House,
organized the celebration. More than 500
people, including students and members
of the Pittsburgh community, Saudi and
otherwise, attended. At the beginning of
the evening, the audience watched folk
dances, live skits and videos about Saudi

Doctor to cross Unitedstates in race for
lung disease awareness

Kathleen Fennell
Staff Wrz'ter

Patricia George said that when cycling
gets hard, she thinks of who she’s riding
for — her patients whose shortness of

breath often makes day-to-day tasks dif-
ficult. In her last race, she encountered
a problem that temporarily prevented
her from shifting gears — an issue that
cyclists call a “mechanical.”

“I literally thought to myself that

there are people with pulmonary hy-
pertension, they have a bad day, they
might have a mechanical, but they can’t
stop. They have to finish. So if I had to

ride without shifting that race, it would
have been extremely difficult. I might
not have made the time cut-off, but I
was going to do it no matter what, in
my mind,” George said.

George, a pulmonologist at UPMC
Presbyterian Hospital, will embark
upon a cross-country cycling road race
called Race Across America, or RAAM,
nextjune along with teammates Anne-
Marie Alderson, Stacie Truszkowski and
Ryanne Palermo, along with a crew of
about 12 people. This time more than
ever, George will be riding for her pa-
tients because her team, Team Phenom-
enal Hope, will race to raise money and
awareness for the Pulmonary Hyperten-
sion Association.

George works in the Pulmonary
Hypertension Clinic at UPMC Presby-
terian and researches HIV-associated
lung diseases, such as pulmonary hy-
pertension. The American Heart Asso—
ciation reports between 500 and 1000
new cases of this rare disease of high
blood pressure in the lung in the United
States annually.

Many patients with pulmonary hy-
pertension receive a delayed diagnosis
because the disease’s symptoms match
many other lung problems, such as

hospitality in the Assembly Room.

According to the Saudi Arabian Min-
istry of Higher Education’s website, the
Saudi government has sent more than
70,000 students to study in the United
States since 2005. The same program
has sent more than 75,000 Saudi stu-
dents to colleges and universities in other
countries.

covered, though there are nine available,
therapies and two more that will soon
be available.

RAAM is a coast-to-coastrace that
begins in Oceanside, Calif., and ends in
Annapolis, Md. Rick Boethling, RAAM’s

executive director, said that the event ,.

started in 1982. The race requires four
full-time staff and a few part-time staff
who work on the race all year round,
with over 200 volunteers who either
travel or stay in stationary points along
the course.

The original race had four sol/o rac-
ers racing from Santa Monica Pier to
the Empire State Building. It was not
until the early ’90s that teams began
to compete in the race. This year, Bo-
ethling expects between 300 and 350
riders to take part in the event.

7 “Sometimes you think about where
you’re riding. Sometimes it takes your
breath away,” George said. Over 3,000
miles, her team will cross 12 states and
170,000 vertical feet.

As a team of four, team Phenomenal
Hope will have to complete the race in
nine days or less, whereas solo racers
have 13 days to finish.

“I would say ultimately the most
competitive is the four-person divi-
sion, whether it be male or female,”
Boethling said.

Boethling said that one of the most

skits poked gentle fun at some of the cul-

- tural misunderstandings that Saudis, who

tend to be observant Muslims, run into
when they travel in the United States. The
subject matter of the skits included infor-
mation about Muslim prayer practices.
In one skit, a Saudi student tells his
friend that he is going to take some time
to pray. As he proceeds to pray on the
street, an American keeps trying to get
his attention to ask for directions to
the Apple store. When the student, who
is still praying, does not respond, the

interesting things about RAAM is that
it has become a huge fundraiser. Each
year, about $2 million is raised for vari-
ous charities. Individual teams have
raised up to $400,000. A
George decided to race for the Pul

monary Hypertension Association after -

attending‘ an association conference at
which the keynote address was given by
doctors who climbed Mount Kiliman-
jaro and likened climbing at altitude
to the shortness of breath experienced
by pulmonaryhypertension patients.

George said that though it is a chal-
lenge to train for such a big race event
while being a doctor, she needs her time
on the bike.

“Sometimes no matter what you do,
you can’t control the outcomes. We do

' our best and sometimes people get bet-

ter and sometimes they don’t.  That’s
part of the job.  What you can control
is your training. You can control get-
ting out of bed and riding your bike,”
she said. _ '

To prepare for the upcoming race,
she has been doing a lot of cycling, but
she isn’t limiting herself to the bike.
She has also been working on her core.
Closer to the event, she will begin to
train in increments to simulate the in-
tervals at which she will be on and off
the bike.

The cars will be driven by team Phe-
nomenal Hope’s crew, led by crew chiefs
Kate Bennett, and Greta Daniels. The
crew will be made up of drivers, naviga-
tors, medics and nutritionists: ’

Bennett, who received her Ph.D. at
Pitt, has known George for about six
years. i‘

“Basically, it’s like planning any-
thing. The racers themselves, all they

’ have to do is get on their bikes. They

have to ride. They have toeat. They
have to sleep.lThey have to do it over
and overagain  The crew chief does
the logistics for everything else,” Ben-
nett said. ’ ‘ it
Though George and her team and
crew will have invested heavily in the
race in terms of training and prepara-
tion, their only incentives are fundrais-
ing for the Pulmonary Hypertension As-
sociation and the pride that comes with
ﬁnishing such an endurance-based race.
“The beauty of RAAM is  you do all
this, you prepare for it, train for it 
and then at the end of the day you cross

finished, and that’s it. That’s the beauty
of it. You go and you do this race.  It’s
for the love of the race and you have
a feeling in yourself that you’ve done
something incredible,” George said. I

Silence is sarin: United States has
a moral obligation to act on Syria

Julia Carpey
For The Pitt News

Throughout history, our great-
est failure has not been bigotry
or ignorance; our greatest fail-
ure is silence. The current civil
war in Syria is testing the moral
compass of the United States,
much like the steady progres-
sion ofthe Holocaust did more
than 70 years ago. The ques-
tions we must ask ourselves
now are: Are we willing to let
this progress to the magnitude
of another mass genocide? If

the window of opportunity has i

closed on our ability to take
initial action, how do we do
damage control?‘

To start with, we must first
look at the parallels between
the current approach of the
United States to Syria and the
development of the Holocaust.
Many of the arguments that the
American public used to defend
its inaction in the"Holocaust
are the same arguments the
world is using today to defend
the United States’s inaction in
Syria: First, Americans were
concerned about Hitler’s in-
creasing power. Today, Ameri-
cans are concerned about Syr-
ian President Bashar al-Assad’s
brutal attempts to suppress the
populist rebellion.

Second, Americans were
against entering another world

i war that primarily concerned

major Western European pow-
ers. The sentiments are quite
similar today. Considering that
we just left Iraq and we’re still
in Afghanistan, Americans are
worried about putting more

troops on the ground in anoth-
er country in the Middle East.
Finally, citizens argued, Ger-
many was a sovereign nation
as Syria is today and, there-
fore, has the right to settle its
domestic conﬂicts internally.
But this mindset has deadly
consequences.

A stark difference between
the two situations, however,
is our access to information
and the speed at which we
can receive it. In almost every
mass tragedy in history, there
are images to prove it in the
aftermath. The images we see
today of the innocent bodies
in Syria lined up for burial ee-
rily echo those we see of the
victims of the Holocaust. Giv-

en Congress’s current lack of '

motivation, it is questionable
as to how much those images
are being used in the decision-
making process.

Professor Ross Harrison,
a faculty member at George-
town University and a visiting

‘ Pitt lecturer of Middle Eastern

politics, said: “Your generation
and social media is a huge fac-
tor here.”

Barbara Burstin, a lecturer
in Pitt’s history department
who teaches a course about
the United States and the Ho-
locaust, said, “The world is far
more connected now than it
was in the 1930s and ’4os. Now
more than ever, we cannot ig-
nore the images and videos.”

This immediacy of infor-
mation is both good and bad.
Technology allows the public
to verify the facts and can read
and see evidence of it the mo-

ment it happens. There is no
lag time in the information get-
ting out, which, in turn, also
makes the window to act close
soonen

Despite the unprecedented
access to media, we’ve wit-
nessed history repeat itself
over the last few years.

On Sept. 16, the United
Nations released statements
documenting test samples
that confirmed what the im-
ages, testimonials and videos
already have displayed: that al-
Assad used one of the deadliest
chemical weapons, sarin gas,
to murder more than 1,400 of
his own citizens.

But according to the Wash-
ington Post—ABC news poll re-
leased on Sept. 20, 61 percent
of Americans oppose any kind
of military action against Syria.
President Obama’s attempts
to gain popular opinion and
persuade Congress to approve
military intervention in Syria
have failed..

There is an eerie parallel
here with the Holocaust. Dur-
ing the 1930s and ’40s, when
the League of Nations visited
Nazi concentration camps in
Eastern Europe, there was
enough evidence gathered to
support a claim against the
Nazis. However, the Nazis dis-
played less severe working and
living conditions than were a
reality at the time. Therefore,
the League of Nations, and in
turn the rest of the world, was
able to turn a blind eye. This
subsequently enabled Nazis to

persecute innocent victims further.
With the U.N.’s recently released
report lending scientiﬁc credence to
what the images, testimonials and vid-
eos have already displayed, the United
States ﬁnds itself at a moral crossroads
again.
There is no question that it is difficult
to emotionally invest in a situation like

October 8, 2018 | The Pitt News I wvvw.pittnevvs.com

this. Many military officials and for-
eign affairs experts are harping on con-
crete numbers on the domestic front to
point to why the United States should
not act, and maybe that’s exactly the
problem._When the United States can
see the parallels between the situation
at hand and historic mass murders, it
has a moral obligation to prevent cur-
rent situations from progressing to
the magnitude of past state-sponsored
mass murders.

Nobody wants to put more boots

on the ground. But more importantly,
five years from now, nobody will want
the blood of innocent civilians on their
hands and guilt from inaction on their
conscience.

Military officials believe that the
window of opportunity for the United
States to deal with al—Assad has closed.
“There’s plenty of what’s morally re-
pugnant over there. But right now we
are ill-equipped to take action,” said
James Williams, a retired United States
military officer and current special

operatives trainer.

The question now is, if we do step
in, what is going to be the result? Are
we going to save lives? Are we enabling
positive change in the region? Or will
we continue allowing al—Assad to buy
time‘?‘?

This is not a political issue. This is
a moral decision about the obligation
we have to take action against crimes
against humanity. We have seen these
shrouds before. I

BEER COLUMN

The beer snob’s guide to picking your pumpkin beer

Jackson Crowder
Stqff I_Wrz'ter

I used to get excited about pumpkin
beer — really excited. When I was first
learning the ropes of beer snobbery,
the changing of the seasons from sum-
mer to fall represented the inﬂux of
pumpkin beers to the market and her-
alded ﬂavors radically different from
all others.

Now, pumpkin beers bore me. It’s not
that there aren’t good pumpkin beers
out there. It’s just that, by and large,
they’re all the same.

Pick just about any pumpkin beer
off the shelf and I can tell you -that,
regardless of its brewer, you’ll taste
cinnamon, nutmeg and malt. This is
largely because most brewers base their
ﬂavor profiles for pumpkin beer off
pumpkin pie. It’s also because just about
all pumpkin beer isn’t pumpkin beer at
all: It’s pumpkin spiced beer. This, of
course, means that the wide majority

of pumpkin beer out there contains no
pumpkin at all.

Traditional pumpkin pie spice uses
one part cinnamon, one part nutmeg,
one part ginger and three-fourths part
allspice, which is why most of these

ﬂavors can be tasted in any decent

pumpkin—spiced beer. Even with this
in mind, it is not the lack of its name-
sake ingredient that bothers me about
pumpkin beer. It isn’t the marketing or
the fact that it shows up injuly. It’s the
predictability.

Still, there are some exceptions.
While most pumpkin—spice beers out
there are nothing to write home about,
two in particular stand out from the
crowd. They are a bit more expensive
than Blue Moon Harvest Pumpkin or
Sea Dog’s Pumpkin Ale, but what they
lack in thrift, they make up for in taste.
Most importantly, these beers aren’t
lacking in originality.

The Boston Beer Company is never
afraid to get a little crazy when it comes

to its seasonal beers, but its annually-
released Harvest Pumpkin.Ale routinely
disappoints in both taste and creativity.

To the rescue, though, is Fat Jack,
its limited—release double pumpkin ale.
Unlike the aforementioned pumpkin-
spiced beers, Fat Jack is brewed with
actual pumpkin. A lot of it. 28 pounds
of it per batch, to be ‘exact. The more
traditional notes of cinnamon and nut-
meg are present and accounted for, as
well. They are strong in the nose and on
the tongue, but are not overpowering in
the way that they are in most amped-up
pumpkin brews.

A surprising addition, though, is the
ginger. Even though it is an essential
component to pumpkin pie spice, most
brewers leave it out of their beers alto-
gether, fearing its spicy, finicky nature.
Not Sam Adams, though. Not by a long
shot. They loaded this beer up with gin-
ger, adding a pleasing spiciness to the
otherwise thick, rich taste.

Like all of Sam Adams’ small:batch

experiments, this is a big beer. It’s
packed with both spice and malt but
tastes more like a pumpkin-based beer
with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger add-
ed than just a standard ale with some
spices tossed in . Ifyou need to have a
pumpkin beer as the weather begins to
ease into fall, Fatjack is a good choice
that will satisfy your autumnal urges
without boring you to death in the
process. Be careful, though. With all
of the ﬂavor and complexity comes an
8.5 percent alcohol by volume that can
sneak up on you very quickly.

This discussion would not be com-
plete without mentioning another truly
original pumpkin beer —— Southern
Tier’s Pumking. Made by New York
State’s finest brewery, Pumking is
easily one of the best pumpkin beers
around. Pumking has the cinnamon and
nutmeg notes that you would expect
in a pumpkin beer, but it adds other

MUSlC REVIEW

Haim sisters make Waves on surfer-sourced, immersive debut

Grace Kelly
Staff Writer

Haim
Days Are Gone
Grade: A-
Sounds like:

sun—soaked jams for a
lazy afternoon

With much of the new pop music pro-
duced either blending into ubiquitous

. obscurity or hitting high marks through

media promotion, it can be hard to find
refreshingly original music that makes
it big. But the Haim sisters quietly break
that trend with their debut album Days
Are Gone, appealing to a burgeoning
pop crowd without sacrificing a laid-
back, LA surfer-sourced sound.

Haim is comprised of Este, Danielle
and Alana Haim, a trio of sisters whose
Southern California upbringing and
debut album evokes images of shred-
ding pavement and washing down long
recording days with a vegan smoothie
in one hand and a Corona in the other.

Born and raised in the San Fernando

Valley, the sisters grew up as part of a
musical unit, as their parents headed a
family band that played covers at local
fairs. While the sisters went through
school, they retained their interest
in music, and each sister held various
roles in a variety of local hands. They
eventually came back together and
formed the core of the band that bears
their surname. Theirs was a lifestyle re-
volving around music, but unlike many
frantic, fame—motivated artists, Haim
took things slow quietly releasing of a
couple of singles and an E.P. over the
course of 2012 culminating in the offi-
cial release of its debut album, Days Are
Gone. There was no “discovery” process
and no Justin Bieber-esque thrust into

the spotlight — just old—fashioned hard
work that slowly brought recognition
to a talented band.

With Days Are Gone, Haim pairs
dusky vocals with nonchalant lyrics in
such a way that invites the listener to
become immersed in the deep tracks,
rather than forcing the music on them.
This is the kind of music you listen to
through your ear—wrapping headphones
in an oversized button-down and ﬂoppy
beanie — in essence, passive, laid-back
music.

The songs don’t start out with head-
banging introductions, but rather work
with a textured beat that forms the plat-

“The Pigeoning”

Through Oct. 12 -
937 Liberty Ave., Cultural District
Showtimes vary '

Admission: $25.

A part of the Pittsburgh Cultural
Trust’s Festival of Firsts, “The Pigeon-
ing” is both a lighthearted and meta-
physically disturbing show. Making use
of bunraku puppets — a traditional style
ofjapanese puppet theatre — the play
tells the tale of Frank-, an office worker
in the 1980s, and his daily struggles

with filthy pigeons who seem‘ bent on.

ruining his life. As the play progresses
and the avian altercations heighten in
intensity, Frank begins to wonder if the
pigeons don’t have bigger plans for him.
Though tickets are currently difficult
to come by, the show promises to be a
strange blur of theatrical styles this city
has never seen.

Human Equity Through Art (HEArt) is
an organization dedicated to exhibiting
the ways that art can be used to promote
the cause ofsocialjustice each and every
day. On Wednesday night, they’re pro-
moting this cause with performances
by two poets who encapsulate this mes-
sage. Pitt visiting professor Terrance
Hayes’ clever, vivid, conversational
poetry delves into issues of inequality
with honest eyes. Saeedjones, who edits
Buzzfeed LGBT, writes poetry that can

capture an immensity of emotion in the

course ofa couple ofwords. The combi-
nation will make for a performance well
worth traveling to the North Side to see. V

Though Tyler, the Creator, is likely
the most notorious member of Odd Fu~
ture Wolf Gang Kill Them All, 19-year-

boarding school following the release

' of his EP Earl, Sweatshirtannounced

his return to the United States and the
hip—hop world with his 2013 release,

BEER

ﬂavors that elevate it to an innovative
level. Alongside the requisite notes is
a prominent vanilla ﬂavor that adds
sweetness and creaminess that plays
well off the beer’s boozy bite of 8.6
percent alcohol by volume. Furthering
the idea of bottled, alcoholic pumpkin
pie (yum), is a curious, savory note
residing in the background that gives
the unmistakable illusion of crust —

warm, buttery crust.

It’s easy to get the idea that Pumking
is a gimmicky beer or a ﬂavored malt
beverage masquerading as something
hardier. Don’t be fooled. Pumking is a
beer that simply happens to taste like
a pie. It is sweet but not overly so, and
each element, while powerful, is in
perfect balance.

Honestly, you can do better than
pumpkin beer during thefall. It’s a
season that sees some truly remark-

able Marzens (Oktoberfests) hit the

 
      
   

market, none of which involve the W0 rd
pumpkin. Still, should you feel a han-
kering for one, there are options out
there that are sure to take care of your
seasonal craving without forcing you
to compromise on quality. I V

form for the-mellow but charged vocals.

The album opens with two of the
most ear-catching songs, “Falling” and
“Forever.” “Forever” starts with a tinny,

, island—sounding beat reminiscent of a
Laguna Beach tiki bar, something that

oddly works. The song then focuses and
centralizes with Haim’s dusky vocals
and a deep beat that pumps up the ac-
tion of the song, drawing the listener

‘into swaying rhythms. This song is a

direct harkening back to the Southern
California background of Haim, employ-
ing an extremely layered, echoed sound
that picks up and even harkens to a sort
of Rusted Root “Send Me on My Way”-
inspired tune. ' »

There is also a sense of throwback
to the 1980s, with echoing synths and
textured, throbbing beats that create a
layered sense of depth, similar to the
music of Joan Jett and perhaps a touch
of Madonna. Neither ﬂashy nor dull,
Haim straddles a line between pop and
lounge music, producing chill tracks
that invite the listener to fall into their
soothing chords, but doesn’t completely
leave you laissez-faire, jacking things
up on songs such as “My Song 5” and
“The Wire.”

There’s an appealing mix of slow and
fast, of calm and crashing. Jagged guitar
chords amp up “The Wire,” while other
songs such as “Honey 8: I”tsmooth out

and have a calmer, melodic tune. Haim ’

is considered a part of the pop genre,

-but draws influence from ’8os chords,

R and B beats and a nu—fo1k backdrop.
SoCal sunny days, surﬁng, skateboard-
ing, rollerblading and blacktop concerts
are some images that the band’s mu-
sic brings to life. Through their mu-
sic, Haim shows a lifestyle that is both
laid-back and also carries a charge that
brings out imaginative energy, culminat-
ing in appealing songs that you will hum
as you walk down the street. I

PlTT N THE NFL

Former Pitt
players struggle
in week five

Sean Corrado
Staff Wrz'ter

In week ﬁve of the NFL season, former Pan-

' thers players did not put up the incredible stats

that fans are used to seeing, yet each alumnus
found a way to push his team to victory.

Philadelphia running back LeSean Mc-
Coy (Pitt 2007-2008) had a mediocre per-
formance against his team’s division rival, the
New York Giants, as he only averaged 2.3 yards
per carry. He also snagged seven receptions
for 46 yards and scored on a goal-line carry
in a 36-21 victory.

Despite his lack of yardage, McCoy’s 46
rushing yards on 20 carries were still enough
to keep a steady lead in the race for the rush-
ing title. His performance brings his season
total in rushingyards to 514, and he nowhas a
93-yard lead over second—place rusher Adrian
Peterson, who was on a bye this week.

McCoy will attempt to stretch his rushing
lead next week against former Panther Dar-
relle Revis (Pitt 2004-2006) and the rest of
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ defense. Tampa
Bay, coming off abye week, will have had two
weeks to prepare for McCoy’s rushing attack.

Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt
2002-2003) only tallied 43 yards on three
receptions in a 22-6 win over Carolina. Fitzger-
ald has yet to pass 100 yards in a game this
season. He will have a tough time eclipsing
that mark next week against a San Francisco
49ers defense thatranksthird inpassingyards
allowed.

San Francisco punterAndy Lee (Pitt2000-
2004) continued to show why he is one of
the best punters at the professional level.
He punted four balls for an average of 48.8
yards to keep the Houston Texans pinned
deep in their own territory. The Texans never

FOOTBALL

Pitt prepares for talented Virginia Tech team

Pitt receiver Devin Street faces a tough challenge against a skilled Virginia Tech secondary. Claire Deahl | Senior Staff Photographer

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The Pitt football team began preparing
for Virginia Tech Monday. The Panthers
enter week seven of the college football
season 3-1 overall and 2-1 in Atlantic Coast
Conference play. Pitt faces the Hokies of
Virginia Tech, a fellow member of the ACC’s
Coastal Division.

No. 24 Virginia Tech (5-1, 2-0 ACC)
currently leads the Coastal Division and
enters Saturday’s game in Blacksburg, Va.,
on a ﬁve-game winning streak. The biggest
news of the day Monday, though, was that
Pitt starting quarterback Tom Savage has
been cleared to play after he suffered a mild
concussion against Virginia.

In other injury news, two starters on

the defensive side of the ball are in limbo
when it comes to their status for Saturday
— starting redshirt senior middle line-
backer Shane Gordon and redshirt junior
defensive end Bryan Murphy — according
to head coach Paul Chryst.

“With Murphy and Shane, we don’t
know how they feel,” Chryst said. “They
both did some running and other things
last week, so we’ll see. We had them doing
some stuff, but no contact.” ‘

Beyond those two, Chryst says the Pan-
thers are as healthy as they’ve been in a
while.

Meanwhile, the road matchup is just
the second for Pitt outside of Heinz Field
this season. The only other experience Pitt
has had on the road this year was atrip to
Duke’s Wallace Wade Stadium, which was

sparsely populated at best. Virginia Tech,
a perennial ACC contender, should provide
the Panthers with a more hostile game-day
atmosphere.

“With my past experiences, obviously
when you go on the road and are on of-
fense, crowd noise is going to be a factor,”
Chryst said. “We have the opportunity to
go earn some experience, and our guys
have to be able to handle it —-— and we will
try to help them.”

Another factor entering Saturday’s
game is the Hokies’ ﬁve-game winning
streak. Virginia Tech opened its season
with a 35-10 loss to No. 1 Alabama but has
not lost since.

“They’re ﬁnding different ways to win,”

Chryst D 10

i§i3iE’iF§r

Chryst said. “They’re playing pretty well
right now, and we’ve got a heck of a chal-
lenge.”

The challenges posed by the Hokies,
offensively at least, reside in the form "of
quarterback Logan Thomas. Although he
posted four interceptions while playing
poorly in Virginia Tech’s loss to Pitt at Heinz
Field last season, Chryst expects the 6-foot-
6 dual-threat quarterback to play up to
his billing.

“He’s obviously a tremendous athlete
and talented quarterback,” Chryst said.
“If he’s going, their team is going. It’ll be a
challenge for us. He’s a good player.”

Overall, the Panthers defense has to
contend with a spread offense that’s putting
up nearly 24 points per game this season.
As Chryst repeats just about every week, he
believes that assignment-sound football is
key for the Panthers to achieve success —
next to tackling well.

“Each opponent presents different op-
portunities, and we’ll certainly be chal-
lenged this week,” Chryst said. “I like where

our guys are at, but we’ll ﬁnd out.”

Defensively, the Hokies enter Saturday’s
game allowing their opposition to score
just 16 points per game. The mark ranks
No. 12 in the nation.

“They’ve got really good corners,”
Chryst said. “Therefore, if you have good
corners and a good secondary, it frees them
up to do a little bit more and bring more
guys in pressure.”

Speaking of pressure, the Panthers’
three-game win streak may ﬁnd itself in
jeopardy, as Pitt faces its second ranked~op-
ponent of the season. The ﬁrst was Florida
State, a team that beat Pitt 41-13 in the ﬁrst
week of the season.

While Pitt has yet to accomplish an
extended winning streak under Chryst,

_ the Panthers’ head coach doesn’t see such

streaks as much more than a slight boost
to the team’s collective conﬁdence.

“I thought going in that working on truly
genuine conﬁdence is something you have
to go out and earn,” Chryst said. “We’ve
got guys working and gaining conﬁdence,
but I don’t think anyone feels like they’ve
arrived yet. I would be really disappointed
if that was the case. '1 ‘don’t believe it at all.
The game makes all of us honest.” I

MEN'S secrete

Players seek to end losing
streak against Virginia Tech

Andrew Stern
Stqff Wrz'ter

The Pitt men’s soccer team (0-6-2, 0-5-
0 ACC) will take the pitch this evening
when it hosts the Virginia Tech Hokies
(3-3~3, 1-1-3 ACC). For a team riding a
streak of winless matches that spans
the Panthers’ most recent 20 games in
conference play, the matchup is a cru-
cial one, according to center back and
captainjohn Cordier.

“Tonight’s game ‘marks the second
half of the season and an opportunity
to get points in the ACC. It’s very im-
portant for us to get a [positive] re-
sult,” Cordier said. “With just six games
remaining, there are plenty of oppor-
tunities to earn points and make the
conference tournament.” ’

Series History

The Panthers and Hokies played
three times from 2001-2003, when both
schools were members of the Big East
Conference. The Hokies own a 2-0-1 re-
cord in the three matchups against Pitt.

The most recent match in 2003 was
a 6-0 home victory by Virginia Tech.

Key Player: Virginia Tech Goalie
Kyle Renfro

This season, Renfro has been critical
to the Hokies’ moderate success. Renfro
has posted three shutouts this season
and has allowed one goal or fewer in five
out of the team’s nine contests.

In a recent match against No. 13
Clemson, Renfro recorded a career-
high 10 saves to help preserve a 0-0 tie.

Last season, Renfro finished third
in save percentage, and ﬁnished atop

the conference in saves with 98. This.

season, Renfro ranks fifth in the ACC
in save percentage, second in saves per
game and fourth in total shutouts. He
is also tied for ﬁrst in saves with Pitt
goalie Dan Lynd.

Pitt Season in Review

This season, the Panthers have strug-
gled with consistency, as the team has

yet to win a game all year. Just last Tues-
day, the Panthers had their best chance
to tally the first victory of the season
in a nonconference matchup against
Xavier.

A pair of miscues, most notably a

missed penalty kick by Ryan Myers, l

combined with a pair of tough calls by
the officials cost the Panthers a victory.

Following the match against Xavier,
the Virginia handed Pitt its most lop-
sided victory of the season, when the
Cavaliers blanked the Panthers 5-0. In
the game, sophomore goalie Dan Lynd
was replaced in favor of Braden Horton
when Lynd gave up the fourth goal of
the match in the 49th minute.

This season, the Panthers have had a
pair of narrow ACC losses to N .C. State
and Boston College. In the match against
the Wolf Pack, the Panthers allowed
a golden goal in the fourth minute of
overtime. Pitt allowed two goals in the
ﬁnal nine minutes against the Eagles,

' including a goal with just 65 seconds

remaining in the contest.

Virginia Tech Season in Review

This season, the Virginia Tech Hokies
have been inconsistent at times. Af-
ter opening the season with a victory
against Binghamton, Virginia Tech fell
to the Fordham Rams 2-1.

Following the loss to Fordham, the
Hokies played well in the first three
ACC conference games they played this
season: a victory over formerly ranked
Syracuse, a tie against former No. 1 team
in the country North Carolina and a tie
against perennial powerhouse Duke.

Since the match against North Caro-
lina, Virginia Tech has lost a pair of
tough matches, a 2-0 loss to Navy and
a 3-0 loss to No. 20 Wake Forest. Two
weeks ago, the Hokies tied No. 13 Clem-
son.

This season, Virginia Tech has failed
to score in a match four times and has
scored one goal or fewer in seven ofthe
team’s nine matches!
