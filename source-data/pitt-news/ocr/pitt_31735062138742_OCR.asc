members of ESGC voted to post-

due to the late hour at which it
was received. However, a commit-

the constitutionality of the pro-

Council Solicits
Needed Clothes

In order to aid in the drive for
much-needed clothing for Greece,
the War Activities Council, in con-
junction with the Greek War Re-
lief Committee is sponsoring a
booth on the ground ﬂoor from
April 28 to May 12. Clothing con-
tributions will be reecived at the
booth from 12:30 to 2:30 o’clock
daily.

This is a part of a nation-wide
campaign to collect 20 million
pieces of clothing for a country
which has been unable to get new
clothing of any sort for almost
four years. The Greek War Relief

Committee in Allegheny county is

asking for 4,000 articles which
will be taken to two main collec-
tion centers in Pittsburgh: the
Holy Trinity Church, Sandusny
street, and the St. Nicholas Church,

South Dithridge street in Oakland.

Procedure for ,Pitt students very
simple. Just bring clothing to the
War Activities booth and the com-
mittee will take care of any need-
ed cleaning or repairing.

The articles most urgently need-
ed are: woolen suits, coats, skirts,
jackets, trousers, sweaters, men’s
shirts, simple dresses, shoes, chil-
dren’s clothing, blankets, towels,
sheets, pillow cases, and knitted
and woolen underwear.

Pitt Bond Receipts
Will Pay For Tank

“A scroll bearing the names of
all Pitt students buying bonds in
the campus drive to purchase a
landing ship for tanks (LST), will
be carried on the ship following its
completion at the Dravo shipyard
on May 30,” Anita Alman, C,
chairman of the drive, has an-
nounced. ’ ‘

The immediate Pitt goal in the
drive is $45,000 to buy one medium
tank for the ship, the tank being
included in the total purchase
price. Each student buying a bond
will receive an LST button signi-
fying his purchase.

Because all campus organiza-
tions are cooperating in this drive,
bond purchaess may be credited to
whomever the purchaser wishes, if
a bond receipt is presented at the
war bond committee booth on the
ground ﬂoor of the cathedral.

To the circulation staff and to
all of the students who volun-
teered help in putting out the
April 14 Servicemen’s issue, the
“Pitt News” gives its sincerest
thanks. The long hours that were
spent in getting out that issue
are deeply appreciated.

Men Elect Gov’t

Representatives  

 

In spite of a concerted effort on the part ‘of the newlyporganized Inlde-f
pendents, the proposed Student ‘Congress was accepted by ‘a two-to-ona‘
margin of the male vote in last Wednesday’s elections.

Engineers Advised
To Stay In School

Until Induction

E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
School of Engineering and Mines,
has advised all engineers to re-
main in, school until they are ac-
tually to be inducted into the armed
forces. Under the selective service
directive of February 15, a cer-

tain quota of undergraduate engi- r

neers in good scholastic standing
were to be deferred until gradua-
tion. While the quota did hot in-
clude all the engineering students.
it did affect most of the students
in good scholastic standing.
On April 4 the quota system of
deferments was revoked by
selective service headqquarters.
This left the engineering students
with no grounds to claim defer-
ment. Dean Holbrook intends to
place on the student’s blueprint
_a statement of his standing in the
sbhool and also the term of Army
Specialized Training for which he
is ﬁtted, in the event the army or
navy should resassign him to a
college" for further engineering
study.

This reassignment, still in the
discussion stage, would take place
after the student had completed
his basic training.

In individual cases, local draft
boards have been requested to post-
pone the induction to the end of
the quarter. The answer to these
requests, is, of course, up to the
jurisdiction of the local oards.

Under the old quota system
there were 39 senior engineers and
129 undergraduate engineers on
the deferred list.

Student Nurses Have _
Special~Chape| Service

Some two hundred nurses, rep-
resenting the schools of nursing of
Allegheny county, will take part in
a special Vesper service in Heinz
Chapel on Sunday, May 7. The
event, honoring the birthday on
May 12 of Florence Nightingale, is
the second of a series of annual
memorials.

The School of Nursing is spons-
oring the service. Mary Alma

ing the student body. .and.Gracia‘

John Whiteman, BA, and Diclﬂ
Slater, E, were elected as senior rep-1
resentatives to the Congress along
with Bill Devlin, C, Grant Lee, G.
and Bob Lazar, E, as junior memq
bers. “Following the rules set dowli
in« the Congress By-Laws,” an-.
nounced Bob Campbell, chairman of-
the elections, “we will not make
known the actual results of the in‘-
dividual elections.”

The third question on the ballot‘
concerning a semi-formal or infor-
mal Spring Festival dance resulted
111 a close victory for the advocates
of the semi-formal affair. Consider-
ation of the vote along with the
women’s desire for'a semi-formal-

Panhellenic Set For Penn

“I’ll Be Seeing You,” is not onlyqf

the title of a currently popular
song, but the catchword for all

members of Panhellenic Associa-i ‘

tion—meaning of course ' that
they’ll be in the Urban room of the.

night at 9’ o’clock for their annual
ball.

Clyde Knight’s orchestra will
supply the music for the informal-
dance, and decorations will consisﬁ
of Greek fraternity letters in gold
on a black background.

Though the dance is a “girls
invite the boys” alfair, the plant
of invitation isn't a leap year
measure, for the Panhellenic As-
sociation annual all has always
been this kind.

Ruth Becker, C,

_ Can you imagine the Pitt of the future?
Can you look out the window and see, where the imported

"Scotch grass now grows", a frat and dorm circle ‘surrounding
 s _th-e Cathedral? Instead of the red tile walls, rough with mortar
I .and protruding wires, can you envision rooms ﬁnished and
V _‘ decorated each in an individual style? Maybe there will be a
 new large swimming pool and a student union where the

“guys and gals” could da.nce in the afternoon and evening.
Undoubtedly there will be a broadening of curricular advan-

-itages and the scope of extra-curricular activities, greatly ex-

ceeding the _pre—war high before acceleration began. Imagine
a time when the stadium is ours and not only football, basket-

" ‘ball, and baseball events are scheduled, but also tennis, golf,
- track, and swimming, to mention a few. Maybe in this Pitt‘ of
the future, we’ll see helicopters hovering over the roof out-

side of the ﬁfth ﬂoor libraries. Nothing is_too far-fetched to

imagine, for if it is the newest and best, Pitt will have it.

=l= >l< >l=
~ It is rather hard to imagine such a Pitt, so changed in

‘ physical appearance. There’s a slight inclination towards envy
of those future students who will have the beneﬁt of the many

proposed improvements. Then comes a tendency to forget

_ these “daydreams” and return to “reality,” as we say.

But here is our reality—because our country is at war
and putting all its resources, thought, and energy into termin-
ating this conflict as quickly as possible, doesn’t mean that her
leaders are not planning a post—war world. We all realize that

 A it is too late to start planning when the armistice is at hand‘

and the whole world is crying for aid. So it is with Pitt. Today,

‘ she is highly geared to the war-time emergency. But, although

she is employed in war activities, she still has her eye to the

 future. Her directors also realize thefallacy in waiting till

the eleventh hour before laying rudimentary plans. This is our
reality——we never cease planning and improving.
What are we, as students, doing for our Pitt of the future,

‘ for it is as much ours as is the Blue Tuck Shop during the

lunch hour rush. Her future belongs to us equally with those
who will take our places beside the Commons Room ﬁreplaces
or walking down ODK walk. For we are laying part of the
foundation on which they will be building. _

Mrs. Starrett in the University Press ofﬁce works on pub-
licizing Pitt to the public. As witness the latest Pitt quarterly
that was sent to high school students in this area, she is doing
abeautiful job. Good will is built up by copies of the Pitt News

and the Owl that go to high school principals on our mailing

list. Why should the faculty, with the aid of publications,
work alone in spreading the opportunities and advantages at

' Pitt. As students, our View of Pitt would have a far more per-

sonal appeal to friends and relatives.

Chancellor Bowman has spent a good bit of his time at
the University in raising the necessary funds for carrying out
proposed improvements; he has buried himself in making the
University what it is. We students might be able to help him
by suggesting to people, who might not otherwise think of
it, to contribute donations to educational institutions as well
as to charities.

' Organizations and drives on campus need student sup-

‘ - port‘. Every student should feel it his duty to vote at elec- '

tions and participate in drives and social events. This doesn’t
imply that everyone should join activities; there are many who
are not interested. But it does mean that after fellow students
who are in activities put in time producing a play, publishing a

- yearbook, or planning a dance, we should make their efforts

worth while. Get behind the newly elected oflicers and their
committee chairmen; help them in their new responsibilities.
Just because you cast a ballot and elections are over doesn’t
mean that your work is done. The future of Pitt lies in your
effort and contribution. .
* * *

It has been said that the things you ﬁght for hardest

mean the most to you. How m.uch does Pitt mean to you? How

much of a ﬁght is it worth? Would you rather go on record as
one who attended classes at Pitt or one who, in addition”, helped
“build the classrooms” at Pitt?

What are YOU doing for your Alma Mater?

following is a list of‘ the aforesaid
deceased mallards:

Hollenbeck. Ken was even helping
Nancy’s fraternity sisters knit an
afghan—-for the soldiers, they say.
The Zetas think that soldiers grab
their afghans before diving into
foxholes. But maybe they do; how
do you know?

Bob Casey and Ruth Schaub sur-

becoming “a pal of mine,” for Ray
Reppert is b. m. on her list right
now. (Rep, however, is at Bucknell
with the baseball team for Pan-Hel
week-end.) Is Ursula going to be a
one-man girl?

Marianne White was ﬁdgiting all

_(she wears hispin ya know) would
get his Army furlough in time for
the Panhellenic Ball.

It was Tri-Delt prexy B. J. Bile-
man and former Pitt man Lt. Guy
Wallace in the Tuck Shop on Mon-

soon.

was truth, too. I didn’t think Bar-

everything be truth, but he did.

nomination as a write-in candidate
for the Student Congress elections
on Wednesday. 11 appreciate the
sentiment, Independents, but ———- the
fortunes of war, you know. . . . One
hundred twenty-ﬁve was a good
number this week, boys. Hope you
played it, Wednesday.

The outlook for the School of En-
gineering looks pretty blue these
days. Most of the students are be-
ing drafted into the Navy. Even the
instructors, namely: “Doc” Bishop
and Mr. Ackenheil, are singing “An-
chors Away” or will be very soon.

some as liquid perfume. Just touch ‘

reality so seemingly ﬁne and so
openly fated.

It is this remnant of a once proud
heritage that provides the tragedy
of the work, a tragedy which Bemel-
mans cannot deny. Nor will their
passing provoke mourning from the
great . mass of the people, who,
though they know little ‘of their ex-
istence, begrudge it—-the mass of
the people who care more for a
ragged doll than one from Dresden.
No, they will not be missed. Not that
they do great harm with their
short-lived fancy, but the time of
evolution has come for them to be
replaced by a more worthwhile or-
der. It is the time now when our
nation lifts its head from its stag-
nant pool and cries for liberation-
the time now for pioneers;

Leonidas Erosa,. unlike the ma-
jority of his fellows, though part
of ‘A their general bewilderment,
realized his lonely disaster. Be-
melmans sights the horizon of his
theme through the eyes of'this
character and in the ﬁnal chapter
of his work, in what seems quite
like an epilogue, voices a pro-
phetic challenge to the future. . . .
To understand it you must know
that Erosa is now dead and more
alone than ever when he calls
upon God:

“Good God, as you wish it. Now
and here if I must, and without
tears. . . . 0 God——I will be good,
I will be good--let me come back
once more to your beautiful earth.
If you would let me live once more,
for ever so small a time and in no
matter what shape, I would be good
-—.I would be kind and generous.
Once more, death Father in Heav-
en. . . .”

And what follows is both beauti-
ful and profound and after it there
is no more to be said:

“In a scene that was like the Na-
tivity, close to the moist muzzles
of the cattle that had been a wed-
ding gift, with shepherds guarding
their ﬂock-s on the horizon, the wish
of Leonidas Erosa was fulﬁlled.

“Not long after he left this life,
he started across the bridge again,
unburdened with any ills of the
ﬂesh; his new impediment was pov-
erty.

“He was the pride of the village.
He)reached out of his reed basket
and cried from full lungs. He was
given the name of Francisco. He
was well born.

Men’s Council
Petitions Due
This Tuesday

Deadline for petitions for mem-
bership on Men’s Council is Tues-
day. May 2. All applicants must
appear for interviews that evening
at 7:30 in the dean of men’s oﬁice.

Election of Council members,
originally scheduled at the same
time as the ESGC elections, has
been postponed two weeks because
of uncertainties caused by prob-
able changes in the draft status of
many Pitt men.

The rules for petitions remain
the same: all properly registered
full-time men students, other than
beginning freshmen, in the Schools
of Engineering and Mines and the
College are eligible for applica-
tion, though the draft status of
each applicant will be taken into
consideration.

Petitions may be obtained in the
dean of men’s office from Mrs. Dor-
field, to whom the properly com-
pleted petitions should be returned.
In addition to the required infor-
mation requested on te petition,
applicants should also state, as
accurately as possible, their draft
-status, expected length of future
attendance at the University, and
such pertinent draft information
as they can supply.

in will be considered together with
any new ones. Those students who
have not ﬁlled a petition, and are
eligible, are urged to do so, and,
through selection and election, try
to represent their school in Men’s
Council. There are four vacancies
to be ﬁlled: two by men in the
Schools of Engineering and Mines;
two by men in the College.

Pitt Co-eds Have
Added Glamour

“The Pitt co-eds of today are de-
ﬁnitely more glamorous than those
of 17 years ago,” s-aid Dr. John M.
Ferguson, associate professor of
economics at Pitt, in an informal
talk to the “Y” Freshman Club last
Thursday.

As a proof of this statement, Dr.
Ferguson showed pictures taken
from an old edition of the Pitt Owl
of the co-eds as they appeared in
1927. When asked what the deﬁni-
tion of glamour is, Dr. Ferguson
said he could not deﬁne it but ad-
mitted that he could recognize it.
He also added that the modern Pitt
co-eds are better students although
they don't study as much as the co-
eds of 17 years ago.

Dr. Ferguson, who is one of the
most popular professors with the
co-eds at Pitt, __is the only faculty
member who has had the pleasure
of dining at all the women’s fra-
ternities on the Pitt Campus.

Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter

By SIGNE WINSTEIN ‘

Teaching is not only the profession of Dr. Lotte Lohstoeter, assist-
ant professor of Modern Languages; it is her favorite hobby asiwelsl.
She knows the trials and triumphs of both sides of the classroom, for she
has attended universities in Germany, France, and the United States '
and has taught at Pitt for twenty-four years. For Dr. Lohstoeter, teach-
ing is not dull routine made of schedules and lesson plans; it is alive
with friendship and interest in her students. She has been an advisor‘ to ~
Women’s Self-Government Association and has followed the fortunes
of the present senior class since they selected her as their counsellor

Fresh Debaters

Get Experience
In Series Tests

Freshmen members of Men’s De-
bate met debaters of Allegheny

. Klollege last Saturday in the second

of a series of practice contests for

inexperienced speakers.

_ The ﬁrst series pitted Mount
Mercy freshmen. against four
members of Men’s Debate: Her-
bert Sheinberg, E, Lee Hershen-
son, C, Kurt Hirschhorn, C, and

’ Richard Davis, C. In the second

‘series, held in the Cathedral,
_these same debaters, with Her-
Juan Feldman, C, displacing Da-
‘sis, faced four speakers from
' ,'All,egheny..In this second group,
decisions were rendered by Ellen
M. Geyer, professor of English,
and Dr. Ford E. Curtis, associate
professor of English, in favor of
the speakers from Allegheny.

Further debates remain unsched-
Illed as yet, althoughtrips to C01-
gate and Bowling Green colleges
are under consideration. Only a few,
speaking engagements in the Pitts-
burgh district are still unfulﬁlled,
-and upon their completion, the for-
mal program of Men’s Debate will
come to an end. _
Because Harry Stark, C, man-
ager of the team, will graduate

, 4 this June, work of the associa-
 . tion has been turned over to those

students planning to be here at
Pitt next year. Tentative elected
officers, to serve for the remain-
der of the semester are Gerald
Stern, C, president, and Herman
Feldman, business manager, the
latter replacing Allan Abramson,
C, who is also "graduating.

These new oﬂicers, in cooperation
with the older ones, are scheduling
as active a program as possible for
;the coming year. To be continued
fdeﬁnitely are certain events which
have been integral parts of the pro-
igram for many years. These include

Dance

Saturday, May 13, in the Schen-

ley ballroom from 9 ot 12.

Margaret Melanos, Ed, ticket
chairman of the ball, explained
that each couple must bring in at
least two books and six cents worth
of postage to the booth on the Ca-
thedral—’s ground ﬂoor and exchange
the “2 books and a 6” for a ticket.
The stamp-s will pay the shipping
costs of volumes to the World Stud-
ent Service 'Fund in New York
which is the ageny for student war
relief. Margaret added, “Of course
everyone who brings in books won’t
be able to get tickets because of the
limited number available.”

Doris Kalmenson, C, publicity
chairman of the drive and dance
announced today that WCAE will
produce a special broadcast ex-
plaining the inter-collegiate drive
and ball to Pittsburgh. Polly Ma-
lone on her “School of Charm”
broadcast will interview the chair-
men from the ﬁve colleges.

Pitt’s War Activities Council re-
ceived a letter today from the World
Student Service Fund thanking
them for originating the plans for
an inter-collegiate drive and ball.
WSSF is going to write to all of
the other colleges of the nation and
tell them of the work of Pitts-
burgh’s colleges.

WSSF explained to the Council
that interest in life for the pris-
oners has been created by the so-
called “universities of captivity.”
In these prison camp schools, work
of full university grade goes on,
instruction provided from among
their own number by men who
were formerly» professors and
graduate students.

In the camps as many as 170
hours of work a week are given. A
regular schedule of class hours is
followed. Practically no subject is
omitted from the curriculum of the
prison camps in Europe and Can-
ada. Subjects include algebra, art,
calculus, chemistry, English com-
position, French, German, history,
bookkeeping and accounting, biol-
ogy, medicine, mechanical drawing,
etc. The most popular studies are
the sciences.

them for their assistance in the
campaign. A ’44 ‘graduate in the
College, Vic wa sa sociology major,
a member of ODK, and in addition
to other activities, he belonged
to the Heinz Chapel Choir. On his
ﬁrst Easter Sunday overseas, he
sang a baritone solo at the Easter
Services.

Stationed at Bowman Field,
Ky., ‘Lt. Mary-Ann Cook is at-
tending the Army Air Course
Schoolof Air Evacuation in or-
der to become a “ﬂight nurse.”
Mary Ann writes, “Our training
is quite strenuous both physical-
ly and mentally, but it is all
worthwhile. All of us here are en-
thusiastic about the work and ea-
ger to receive the gold wings if
and i‘ when we graduate. We’re
really looking forward to active
duty.”

Since Lt. Herbert Gall was home
last September he has piled up 500
hours of ﬂying time on training
missions. Herb is a Navigator sta-
tioned at San Antonio, Texas. He
says, “One nice thing about our
type of training is that we ﬂy to

recently been to New York, Miami,
Los Angeles, and Walla Walla on
four different ﬂights.” Graduated in
’42, Herb was active in‘ROTC, Pitt
Riﬂes, and Scabbard and Blade
while he was at school.

Three of our men were ho-me last
week: Lt. Bob Page, former Pitt
News Make-Up Editor, recently re-
turned from service overseas in
North Africa and Italy; Lt. Alex
Zelenski, who edited .the Sports
Page of the News was on leave from
his station “out West”; and Irv
Friedland, on furlough, stopped at
school to see some of the people he
used to know. Irv, a ’43 graduate
and political science major, is now
stationed at Fort Bragg, N. C.

Lt. ﬁg.) William B. Bendix,
who graduated from our Dental
School in ’42, writes from Quan-
tico, Va., that he was delighted to

demands were made upon Dr.
Lohstoeter’s knowledge and skill.
She found it a “challenge,” as
she puts it, “to work with men
who had already achieved suc-
cess in life, men of mature
minds,” and found it “refreshing
to work with AST’s younger men,
who are more like my college
students.” Her kindness and en-
thusiasm made a hit with the
soldiers, and every now and then
some of them drop her a line or‘
two. ,
Woven in her love of teaching is
Dr. Lohstoeter’s other hobby—-peo-
ple. Crowded streetcars don’t annoy
her, she likes to watch faces and
try to :t‘athom~what lies behind a
pair of blank lifeless eyes or a tense
drawn mouth. Almost every day
she ﬁnds V-mail letters on her desk.
They come from former students
whom she has known and befriend-
ed, and they are postmarked from
scattered places around the world.
Last Christmas brought a card from
dancer Gene Kelly, Pitt alumnus.

Her family, of course, holds high-
est place in Dr. Lohstoeter’s affec-
tion. Shehas a young grandson and
is she proud of him! That picture
on her desk is of no one else. There
are difficulties in juggling ration
points that just don’t crop up in a
German class, but Mrs. Lohstoeter
carries through. She enjoys prepar-
ing “home - cooked meals,” but
doesn’t go in for those elaborate
creations in Women’s magazines. Dr.
Lohstoeter will admit, with a wink,
that there have been times when
necessity has forced her to rely on
the can-opener for dinner.

But if her family is more than
a hobby, so is her writing. Dr.
Lohstoeter has contributed lin-

Book Week May 7

May 7 to 14 has been designated
as the second annual observance
of Religious Book Week. Signiﬁ-
cant religious books representing
the three great religious bodies oi
braries and book stores during this
week. i ,

William Lindsay Young, "re-
gional director, says, “In remem-

lin burning of the books which‘
‘occurs this week, it might be
worthwhile to note that if burning
books may be necessary to the
preservation of Nazism, reading
them is necessary to the preserva-
tion of democracy. Read a book
this week with spiritual values in
it, and make your contribution’ -to

‘ocratic heritage.”

Dr. 0. Leonard O’Connell, dean of
the School of Pharmacy, who is
co-chairman of the western Penn-
sylvania region, heads this 
at Pitt. .

v "What can I say of Good Night Ladies? It was.one of the funniest
plays I haveever sat’ through. And yet, it was about the corniest affair
ever to be thrust upon the legitimate theater. One of the Nixon patrons
reached something of an acme of profundity when he stated at the
‘end of the second act, “The Casino was never like this!” Not that I

..have ever been to the Casino, of course—but, Good Night Ladies was as

pure burlesque as anything‘ which by tradition is supposed to take place
in burlesque theaters.

A The question before the house is: (‘an burlesque, even when dis-
guised, be considered from the standards of orthodox drama? Or,
should we let our hair down and judge it as a burlesque? “Good Night
Ladies” contains hardly a joke which is not old, obvious, or vulgar.

Army Exhibit At Kaufmann’s
For A Two-week Showing ,

“This Is the Army, Mrs. Jones,” an oﬁicial Army Service Forces
exhibit illustrating in detail a cross-section of the U. S. Army in training
and overseas, will open for a two-week public showing in the twelfth
ﬂoor auditorium at Kau-fmann’s department store at 2 o’clock Monday
afternoon. .

The exhibit, which has completed similar two-week schedules in
Providence, R. 1., Rochester and Bulfalo, N. Y., has been designed to
prove but one point-—that the American soldier, despite the conditions

A under which he may be forced to
live and ﬁght, is being furnished
the best in food, clothing, equip-
ment, medical care, spiritual, and
recreational guidance that money
and brains can produce. The ex-
hibit provides, in short, a novel
opportunity for Mrs. Jones to ﬁnd
out for erself how Willie and a
lot of the other boys from Maple
Street have been living since they

eventual overseas duty, the exhibit
dispenses detailed information on
Army training, religion, food, trans-
portation, recreation, health, per-
sonal equipment, Women’s Army
Corps operation, and ordnance. An-
other section, “Help at Home,” is
devoted to the instruction of rela-
tives of service men. It can furnish
all regulations, for instance, that
govern the sending of V-mail and
other messages to troops overseas;
the proper methods of sending pack-
ages to prisoners of war; and ﬁrst-
hand opinions on what the average
soldier needs and appreciates most
in a package from home.

The display is constructed in
strict departure from the usual
exhibit of war equipment. Mrs.
Jones isn’t expected to look at
each display, then pass on quiet-
ly to the next. She is expected to
ask questions, personal questions
regarding the provisions that
have been made for her son or
daughter in the service. She may,
if she chooses, ﬁre the training
guns that her son used during
basic training. She may discuss
military religious programs, rec-
reation, health, or other subjects
at length with well-tutored enlist-
ed women.

“This Is the Army, Mrs. Jones”
is one of three oﬁicial ASF exhibits
now touring the United States.
Lieut. Frank X. Kiefer, commander
of the group, is the only male repre-
sentative of the Army connected
with the exhibit. This is the only
display Operated by Women’s Army

Corps personnel.

Few of the people who 
“Harry” all day long when they’1‘¢.
looking for the University elev,a,l_:0r;
dispatcher, realize that Ha.*.'ry’tl_
name is not Harry but Byron.
Byron De .Bee, to be exact. f

“About my nickname,” said Har-
ry, “it’s funny the way it started.
A Coca-Cola man called me “Hail-.
ry” one day, the Army men picked
it up, and now everyone thinks,
“Harry” is really my name.” V

Harry’s job is to supervise the
other 12 elevator operators and to
“see that everyone is happy.” The
other operators, faculty members;
and students whom he greets avg
serves cheerfully will all veri _"
that he is doing his job.

In case you don't know Harry.
he's the. smiling operator who ill
usually in the downstairs hall. Not‘
very tall, he walks slightly stooped,-
is about 45 years old, has deep‘_
brown eyes that smile when he
speaks, has half-greyed hair, and,
a long, lean face. «

“My only hobby is work” he’
frankly confesses. “I’ve done it
all my life and I’m crazy about it.-
When I get a vacation, I can’t stay
away from my work after the ﬁrst
day off.” Harry works seven days
a week, during the week from 6
a. m. to 4:15 p. m. and from 6
a. m. to 2:30 p. m. on Satur y,
and Sunday.

Harry lives in Swissvale witli
his wife and says he’s very much
married. His favorite past time
other than work is hunting and
ﬁshing. One year he raised 95 can-
aries, but he quit this hobby when
his bird family became too large.
Just incidentally, he hasn't seen a‘
movie for two years.

Before he came to the Univer-
sity, Hary drove grocery, dry
cleaner trucks. He’s done electric
welding and has been around ele-
vators for the past 15 years. 1

Next time you hear someone
calling, “Has anyone here -seen‘
Harry?” it's the friendly elevator
dispatcher they’re paging. ’

Students Meet
For Luncheons

The Student Association of the
School of Applied Social Sciences is
currently sponsoring a series of
luncheon-discussion parties on Tues-
day afternoons for its members

Meeting in the Group Work Stl£lI0
on the thirty-second ﬂoor at 12:31!
o’clock, these gatherings, which the
students have dubbed “Tunefd
Tuesdays,” ﬁrst feature luncheon
and music furnished from a large‘
collection of records owned by the
school, and afterwards, open dis-
cussion on some important social
question.

On‘Apri1 25 the Wagner-Murray-
Dingle bill now pending in Congress,
was discussed. On May 2, the stud-
ents will consider the proposed
changes in the constitution of the
S t u d e n t Association, changes,
which, if agreed upon, will be adopt-
ed at the time.

Ann Panaccio, C, chairman of the
Curriculum Committee of the asso-
ciation, will report the ﬁndings of
her committee on student opinion
on courses offered this year by the
school. To determine this, the com-
mittee has conducted a poll of the
students on this question.

Travel restrictions will "wreak further havoc with any

‘can double up at two positions in preference to one who ﬁlls,

able practice sessions. Late classes and bad weather have up

his group of hopefuls. -
i Come what may though Coach Mitterling and his spirited
‘ nine can be counted on to do their best through this, the most
trying season of Panther sports. Carrying on with what civil—
ians they have mustered and hoping they will be here for: 
another month. of competition, the hicory wielders will be in

and his diamond proteges. For nobody could be that had? At
least we sincerely hope not. C
For one thing it ‘was the initial college performance for
the majority of the skyscraper representatives and the slip-
pery conditions caused by the wet grounds did not make things
_ any easier for the Mitterling men. On the other hand the in-
C vaders had the experience of their ‘opener behind them. In
addition to this, bad breaks plus lack of a scoring punch on

ing wins have placed the Orange
and Blue as one of the powers in
this district.

Coach Ralph Mitterling will
switch his line-up around some-

‘what from that of last Monday’s

may move catcher Joe Kielb to the
outﬁeld to give that department
some much needed punch. Replac-

action in Monday’s ﬁasco; Al is a
veteran of two years ago, but was
ineligible last year due to scho-
lastic diﬂiculties. He was handi-
capped at the beginning of the
season due to an arm injury, but
it is likely that he will be able to
start tomorrow. Jim Reber, who
turned in a ﬁne seven inning
stretch of one hit pitching, will
round out the battery. “Big Jim”
was on the mound in yesterday’s
ﬁnal practice session and showed
good form.

Thirteen men will make the trip
to Bucknell. They will include:

On the mound for the Buffaloes
will be a former Pitt boy who has
been settled there through the
courtesy of Secretary Knox and
the Navy V-12 Program. He is
John Kelly (no relation to the
Commando) of Braddock. This
stocky sailor did a lot of relief
hurling for last year's Panthers.
In his initial appearance of this
season, against Bloomsburg last
Saturday, he pitched four score-
less innings in a relief role.

behind him in centerﬁeld will be
his brother Bob. Frank Burns who
romps in the right field section is
an ex-Temple boy. He played foot-
ball there and at his “wartime sub-

"stitute alma mater” Bucknell last

year. At present he is the team’s
leading powerhitter. Burns was a
pitcher last year and even got’ in

' a few licks against Pitt; but his

to the moundstrong Bisons so he

Panthefs Nosed Out, 8-7

The Panthers opened their 1944
home campaign on Monday after-
noon before a record crowd of 73
stout hearted fans who braved the
drenching downpour to jam Pitt
Stadium and watch the Pitt nine
battle Juniata. The Indians added
to the chill of the afternoon by
handing the Mitterling aggrega-
tion an 8 to 7 setback.

Starring for the Panthers in the
relief role was Big Jim Reber, a
veteran from last years squad. In
his seven innings on the mound
Reber displayed excellent form and
control throughout, holding the In-
dians to one hit. The big tackel is-
sued but three walks which did not
deal in the unearned run which
Juniata nicked him for. Pitt failed
to deliver in the clutch and left
the tying run stranded on base on
three occasions. Aiding the defeat
was the poor support in the field,
and sloppy base running. Juniata
scored it’s ﬁrst: 4 runs when Pitt

should have had the side retired.
Matthews tried to hurry the pivot
toss on a double play ball and the
throw was high over Lozar’s head.
Then the ﬁnal run which was the
margin between victory and defeat
was acounted for by a slow ground-
er hit to Reber, who threw wild
to first; then, the runner later
scored on passed ball.

RAIN BALTS GAME

George Goldberg started for the
Panthers and although he appear-
ed in only 1-2/3 innigs, it was
long enough for the lanky six fdot-
er to be charged with the defeat.
In his short whirl on the mound
Goldberg gave up four runs, by
the virtue of a walk and five solid
hits before being relieved by Pierce
who quickly retired the side. A
heavy downpour halted the game
for 45 minfutes and before it could
be resumed ditches had to be dug
in the outﬁeld and saw dust scat-
tered around the mound, the plate
and second base. Pitt made a des-

; perate try in their half of the sec:

ond to knot the score, but the best
they could do was to drive in two
runs.’ Three men died on base when
F. Eisenhart made a diving catch
of Helvonik’s low liner to turn in
the best play of the game. :.-

The ninth for Pitt provided I‘
slight chill for the invaders as the?
first man, Pager, walked and went
to second on a wild pitch. But, ad
before, the Mittei-ling; men lacked

a scoring punch, wheii, with none" ’

out they failed to score. McKee
ﬂied out, Reppert was called out on
strikes, and Reber, who could have
added a Frank Merriwell finish “,8
la Apple,” rolled to the pitcher for
the ﬁnal out of the game.

;A very profound statement was
iiecently made by a University of
{Alaska Student: “I don’t mind the

snow, but I wish it wouldn’t stay,

fon the ground.” It seems to me he
had better. move to California.
From the Navy at Ohio Wesleyan
‘University comes the crack (?) of
the week. A young army private
gwas lounging against the side of a
guardhouse dreamily smoking a
jeigarette when a captain passed
by and stopped in amazement.

_’.‘Young man, can’t you read that

 ten feet in front of your eyes
lihat distinctly says, ‘no smoking’?
bellowed the captain. “If I could

i read that sign,” he said, “I’d be in

Elle navy now.”

It must keep Lincoln and Lee Uni-
;versity students (Kansas City)
guessing as to what state they're
in. The Kansas-Missouri state
boundary runs right through their
‘gniversity.

and his band for a nationwide broadcast of the Victory Parade of Spot-

Auction goers ‘at Bucknell Uni-
versity were puzzled when a certain
fraternity chapter, forced to close
because more than two-thirds of its
members were in the service, put
up for sale one unused tombstone
along with kitchen ware, furni-
ture, and athletic equipment. Mem-
bers of the fraternity explained
that when the chapter's pet dog
was killed recently, ,a sympathetic
alumnus donated a memorial. But
the sale came along before_ the
memorial could be erected and
Fido’s tombstone went for $1.25.

Final’ joke. A Harvard lad was
showing a young visitor from the
R.A.F. the sights of Boston. The
tour included the Bunker Hill
Monument. “This is where Warren
fell, you know,” he explained. The
English ﬂier shaded his eyes and
looked up to the top of the monu-
ment. “Nasty drop! _I_{__illed him, I
take it.’’-,_“
