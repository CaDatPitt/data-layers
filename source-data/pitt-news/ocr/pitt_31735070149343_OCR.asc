Before night classes began at 6
p.m. on Monday, the line of stu-
dents and faculty in front of the
Cathedral of Learning was backed
up more than 50 feet to the Forbes
Avenue crosswalk. '
Freshmanjosh Kreidler stood in

the back of the line with nearly 70.

people ahead of him as he waited to
enter the'Cathedral for class.

He saidthe new security pol-
icy for checking backpacks and
University ‘IDs on campus, which
Pitt instituted on Monday, makes
things difficult for him and other
students in Litchﬁeld Towers, since
many pack items in case of a late-
night evacuation. The dorm com-
plex has been evacuated four times
since April 3 and was theﬁrst dorm
to receive a threat.

“We have to have everything
on us just in case something hap-
pens where we can’t go back and
get them, and then wehave to have
our bags searched,” Kreidler said.

’ “It’s just such a hassle.”

The Daily Student

Pitt implemented their new se-
curity. measures in response to the
semester’s spree of bomb threats
on campus — which hit a total of 57
on Monday after campus received
an unprecedented 12 threats.

Students who brought back-
packs or other bags stood in line
to have them searched, while

‘students without them breezed
through much faster, simply ﬂash-
ing their Pitt‘IDs to the guards.

The security at various points-

on campus was spotty, however-. At
some doors, guards did not check
everyone for IDs or search bags. At
others, such as in the breezeway
entrance to Posvar Hall, guards
stood behind locked doors.
Provost and Senior Vice Chan-
cellor Patricia Beeson and Execu-

.tive Vice Chancellorjerome Co- -

chran issued a statement Sunday
night detailing the new security

' measures.

The statement said that all
people entering “secure” Univer-
sity buildings must present a Pitt

ID ‘and that backpacks would not .

be allowed in academic buildings.
Overnight, Pitt updated the policy

The next threat’ came at 11:11
a.m. Pitt sent out an Emergency
Notiﬁcation System alert no-
tifying the campus of a bomb
threat at the University Club. The
threat also forced an evacuation

at neighboring Thackeray Hall

about a half hour later.

“I wasn’t expecting it to hap-
pen here,” said Mallory Koch, a
junior who works in the Univer-
sity Club. “And it wasn’t coupled
with anything else. It’s such a
random, small building.”

Before that threat was cleared,

unprecedented lzithreats

four_more buildings received
threats. A little before 1 p.m.,"
Frick Fine Arts, McCormick Hall,
Posvar Hall and David Lawrence

Hall were evacuated because of
- threats. '

At 2:20 p.m., three other cam-
pus buildings —- Heinz Chapel,
Panther Central and Victoria Hall
— received threats.

The buildings were evacuated,
and by 3:25 p.m. all were cleared

- of threats.

N. John‘ Cooper, the dean of
the Kenneth P. Dietrich School

email Monday morning to all
faculty outlining how best to ac-

to go home for the semester and‘

to address the lack of an atten-

for “flexibility.” ‘ .
He also used the email as a
opportunity to voice his feelings

  SGB encourages students to stay ‘Pitt proud’

By Gretchen Andersen
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt students gathered outside the
William Pitt Union Monday to show
appreciation for the Pitt police and

P the work the officers have been do-

ing regarding the threats.

Sponsoredby Student Govern-
ment Board, Pitt Pride Day drew
students with free popcorn and
pizza as they signed their names
on a bright yellow “Thank You Pitt
Police” poster. h

After signing the thank you
poster, students got their picture

taken with a" message they wrote
on a piece of paper. Some students
wrote “Keep Ca1m” while others
wrote “Hail to Pitt.” The pictures
will be used to make a Cathedral of
‘Learning-shaped collage.

Freshmanjack Pidgeon walked _
over to sign the board soon after '

the event started ,at 1o a.m'.
‘ “We’ye heard people  are talk-

ing badly about Pitt. Thepolice‘

are doing everything they can do.
I have respect for the police for
being diligent and for sacriﬁcing
time with their families,” Pidgeon
said, i

“Signing a big thank you card

is the least we can do,” Pidgeon
said.

Anna Mullin, a sophomore,
said she signed the Thank You Pitt
Police board because “they’ve been
working like crazy.”,,Mullin said
she live's‘off campus and hasn’t had
many classes interrupted.

“Theyare doing a great job in

handling this _— not overreacting

but being safe,” Mullin said.
Today marked an-increase
in seeurity on Pitt’s campus. Po-
lice searched through bags and
checked IDs before students en-
tered several campus buildings.
The .heightened security comes

after a weekend of bomb threats
and dorm evacuations.

Freshman Sharon Bomberger
said she feels police are/taking
thelright steps. Bomberger lives
in Litchﬁeld Towers and has been
evacuated from her dorm in the
middle of thenight. I

“It’s kindof annoying,” Bomb-~

has also had to evacuate from her
dorm. Francis, who lives in Suther-

of students around campus.

Louderback also plugged the

signed to encourage students to

Louderback said that, besides

McVeigh said that he has missed at least
six classes due to the threats.

“I am not frustrated, but I am worried
we are not going to finish this semester,”
McVeigh said. _

Unlike some students’ families who
have kept them from continuing to attend

classes on campus, McVeigh does not feel

that there is any real.danger to University

“Do I think a building is actually going

A representative from the University was
not available for comment. 9

Over the weekend, Pitt police announced
that thejoint Terrorism Task Force is aiding
the FBI and Pitt police in investigating the
source of the bomb threats.

The new security measures have some
students feeling safer on campus, but others
are annoyed.

‘ Marc Johnston, a sophomore global
studies and history major, said he”feels the
new security measures make the process of

evacuating buildings simpler.

“I feel like it’s the right motive, butI don’t
think the threats will stop,” Johnston said.
“I feel like it makes it easier on the police,
and we all want to make their jobs as easy
as possible.”

Unlikejohnston, other students entering
the Cathedral felt the new security measures
were counterintuitive.

Sophomore Justin Layou, undeclared,
said he feels creating large pockets of stu-
dents outside doorways increases the danger
of the situation.

i _ “I feel it’s really unsafe that they’re hav-
ing us wait in line outside in order to check
bags,” Layou said. “My friend earlier had his
bag checked, and they squashed his back-

pack as an equivalent, which is really bad
if someone is actually going to bring in a
bomb.”

Freshman Amira Soubiane, an anthro-
pology, French and history major, stood in
line at 6 p.m. with about 50 people in front
of her as she waited to enter the Cathedral
for her 6 p.m. class.

Soubiane said she tried to make accom-
modations to deal with lines but still couldn’t
avoid the wait.

“I tried to come out ﬁve minutes earlier,
but I still carried a backpack. I don’t care
what they say, they can check me,” Soubi-
ane said. “But ﬁve minutes is’ deﬁnitely not
enough for the Cathedral.” I

Pitt's new safety measures  
underscore information gap

The I new safety measures Pitt
instated Monday might be
working to make some people

in the community safer — but p

at what cost?

i As a response to the ever-
increasing bomb threats on
campus, Pitt began establishing

R heightened security in the form if

of limited access to University
buildings, required Pitt ID cards
and checked bags. This is a revi-
sion of an earlier policy that for-
bade carrying any bags at all.

In a statement, "Pitt dubbed 1

this as a ‘,‘necessary"security
step” and said these measures
would reduce the time’ needed
to clear evacuated_~buildings.
But instead of “necessary,”
this has been a disorganized
procedure that features loop-
holes and wasted time ' and

seems to be an example of ‘pub- -

lic relations in disguise.

These security measures
aren’t preventing the threats -
pens and Internet access haven’t
been forbidden, of course '— so
they seem to be ‘more reactive
than proactive. '

These measures were de-

signed, then, for three possible
reasons: 1) to make us feel safer,

2) for the sake of Pitt’s image or ;

3),in response to information
the University knows but we
don’t. In the ﬁnal case, Pitt must
tell us if these threats are, to its
knowledge, credible in any way.

With widespread fear in-
creasing each day, this campus
certainly has a post-Sept. 11 feel
to it — except that there have
only been empty threats, not
actual acts of terrorism. So with
the information that the public
has been given, the campus is
reacting to the sheer possibil-
ity of something bad happen-
ing, not any actual damage or
attacks. '

We’d be delusional if we
were to suggest that there, is
not a possibility of all this cul-
minating in something devas-
tating, but these new measures

are only instilling fear in some

while wasting resources and

valuable class time. *
Pitt says this security has

been instated to make clear-

ing evacuated buildings more
efficient. But buildings have
not been cleared of threats any
faster, and howeverrmuch time
we might makeup will certainly

be replaced by the amount of

time that it now takes to get into
campus buildings. . V _ _
“ Pitt has some real heavy hit-

“ ters involved in this investiga-

tion, so it has been tough to be-
lieve that it has been handling
this issue inefficiently. But the

increased security around cam-4

pus leads, us to start rethinking.

Perhaps a simple physical

presence —— security guards
who simply look out» for suspi-

cious activity is one thought. —— .

could serve the same purpose as
these measures without slowing
down the everyday functions of
the University.

Pitt doesn’t ‘need to instill p

such a massive inconvenience
on the community to _look like
it’s doing something. Though
we ‘ cannot. see people working
around the clock to catch those
responsible _for these threats,

we’ve trusted.that, along with.

many experts, Pitt" is takingthis

seriously and working diligently ,

to bring the threats to an end. V
But this campus, is exasper-
ated. V ‘ p ,
Prospective students can’t
explore University ‘buildings,
getting to class has been made
‘even more difficult, and, per-

haps most disconcertingly of .

all, the bomb threats have only
increased.

V So, we ask, why the new
measures? A call for increased

- security this late in the game
leads us to believe that perhaps r

we don’t know all we should
about this investigation.

We’ realize that the‘ public
doesn’t need to know all the
details, but perhaps an update
on the process of this investi-

gation would help us feel safer,

No amount of security guards
or bag searches will quell the
intense fear that is quickly
permeating this campus — we
need answers. _

We need to know that some-
thing is being done} '

What if Pitt stopped evacuating buildings when-.
ever it received bomb threats? '

In the midst of such trying times, that question
mightturn stomachs, its idea striking as short-
sighted, even callous. But we must acknowledge
the danger of marrying ourselves to a single solu-
tion to this unprecedented problem. If our objec-
tive is to resurrect Pitt’s eroding learning envi-

ronment, then we must instead commit to laying‘
all options bare, to subjecting all ideas, whatever ’

their emotional valence, to careful scrutiny and

debate. Otherwise, we risk our educational insti- I

tution perishing of self—inﬂicted wounds.

Each way of responding to these bomb threats I

carries unique combinations of beneﬁts and costs,
none of them satisfactory. Showing unquestion-
able courage and composure, our administration
has chosen the response policies that glue behind-
the-scenes investigation with entry—screening and
no-exceptions “notify and evacuate.” As part of
the debate that should be happening more broad-
ly, I’m here to contend the latter policy is exacting

A huge‘ costs -that are too infrequently discussed.

Hence, I believe Pitt —— its leadership and commu-
nity — should at least consider the merit of a less
reactive alternative: Investigating after receiving

bomb threats, sure, but not screening, evacuating, .

texting or emailing.

A contagion of fear has infected campus, and
the successive, endless nature of bomb threat-re-
lated notiﬁcations and evacuations have ampliﬁed
the hysteria, with the new security measures only
lending credence to the fears. No comfort-minded
appeals from Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, Dean
Kathy Humphrey or The Pitt News columnists
seem equipped to contain it. p

In larger numbers, students are greeting ad-
ditional emergency notiﬁcations with visceral
reactions, often not based in reason. They invent
theories, make inferences and draw spurious con-
nections, all in an effort to gain psychological
control over the uncontrollable. But, it should be

noted,.the real consequence has been a fear level
rising much faster than the reason to be afraid.

’ Despite the lack of hard, tangible evidence behind

these vacuous threats, students 4 are neverthe-
less looking over their shoulders, ﬂeeing to their
homes and dreaming about a Pittsburgh reenact-
ment of the Virginia Tech shootings.

Through the medium of notiﬁcations, screen-

I’ sings and evacuations, the bomb threats have pro-

duced a pervasive feeling of being threatened, and
this feeling has exacerbated the direct damage in-
ﬂicted upon the basic functioning of the Universi-
ty. Besides the undue stress placed on faculty,'who
have to adapt syllabi to uncertain class meeting
times yet still meet their other responsibilities, the
current threat response has forced unpleasant am-
biguity into grading, since the deﬁnition of “fair
evaluation” becomes dubious when you mix fear
with academic performance. More importantly, the

.screen—notify-evacuate-induced fear has already

compromised Pitt’s'long—standing goal to build a
“safe learning environment.” Whatever the actual
probability of violence, an environment in which
students must worry about not only whether their
classes will meet but also whether their classes’ will
be attacked is not a “safe” one for learning. _
Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect ‘of the
screen—notify—and-evacuate policy lies in its poten-

Pitt might well be acting based
on its own interpretation, but it’s
also likely accounting for the in-
terpretations of federal lawyers.
Surely, it does not appear that Pitt
is‘ legally required to evacuate, as
certain schools and universities
have -historically responded to
bomb threats without evacuat-

ing. “I can’t think of a speciﬁc law . .

follow,” Pittsburgh—based school

However, regarding notiﬁca-
tions, Pitt administrators might
be trying to avoid the massive
ﬁne and negative public relations
that could be imposed by a De-
partment of Education l-awsuit.

A The DOE enforces a 1990 fed-

eral statute called the Clery Act,
which .‘ requires higher educa-

‘ tion institutions to “immediately

notify ..the .campus community
uponfthe‘ conﬁrmation of a sig-
niﬁcant’ emergency‘ or danger-
ous situation,” and a recent DOE
handbook lists‘ under “other”
signiﬁcant emergencies the
term “bomb threat.” Pitt could
not name the laws guiding the
screen-text-evacuation ‘policy as

If indeed the Clery Act has pre— '

vented Pitt’ from fairly weighing
all alternatives, then there is enor-
mous justiﬁcation for our Univer-
sitytowork with the‘DOE to mod-
ify the department’s enforcement

perspective. Given how much

Pitt’s threat response has taken
from our community, how ican
we continue deﬁning every last
evidence—less, empty bomb threat
as a signiﬁcant emergency?

As I cannot determine the risk
of a violent activity, I cannot fully
advocate one policy over another.

For the latter part of the last cen-
tury, Oakland’s nighttime city
soundtrack featured distorted
guitar riffs and walking bass lines
mixed with the chatter of crowds.
The Decade, Electric Banana and
Graﬁiti were local jukeboxes of
musical creativity and barstool
entertainment; But by the end
of the century, neighborhood
residents needed to accept a new
musical style — silence.

Each club had a unique reason
for closing, but the owners’ per-
sonal connections to the booking’
and operation of the venues even-
tually strained both the Decade’s
Dominic DiSilvio and the Electric
Banana’s Johnny Zarra.

DiSilvio closed the Decade in
1995 with a ﬁnal show by local
rockerjoe Grushecky.

“It was a very sad time. It was
bittersweet. The main reason [for
closing the Decade] , I was getting
a little older. I had the place for

22 years. The music was getting’

louder; which it really wasn’t, I
was just getting older,” Disilvio
said. ‘

He offered the club’s owner-
ship to his children who declined

interest — a decision Disilvio did

not hold against them.

“None of my kids really want-
ed to go into the business. It’s a
very bad business for livers and
marriages, so I wasn’t too dis-
appointed that they didn’t want
to go into it. It was one hell of a
ride,” he said. V

After the Decade closed, the
building remained a live-music
venue but rapidly changed names
and management; Russ Sch-
neider, currently a guitarist with
the East End All—Stars, recalled
performing there over the course
of two years and experiencing
four different names for the loca-
tion. .

“We played there as it changed
hands three different times. It
went from the Decade, to Ribb-
itz, to Tobacco Roadhouse, to the
Next Decade — all in like ’96,” he
said. - '

A campus bar, Garage Door

Saloon, currently‘ occupies the-

property once home to the club.

_ A plaque on the Sennott Street-

facing wall of the building com-
memorates the Decade as “Al-

— most a Landmark.”

The Electric Banana closed in
2000 afterjohnny andjudy Zarra
lost interest in hosting live music
and saw a chance to take advan-
tage of the opening of a Residence

Inn across the street by convert-

ing their club into a ﬁne Italian
restaurant.

“The way it happened was it
didn’t matter what night of the
week it was and who was playing.
It just didn’t matter. The reason
we got out of it was when they
built the hotel. And I was in the

Facebookfast doesn’t lead increased prductivity

By Hope McLaughlin
For The Pitt News

It was the end of my junior year of high
school, a mere three years ago, when I ﬁrst
created my Facebook account. I was the
late bloomer; the majority of my friends
and peers had Facebooks by ninth grade,

some even earlier. Before I caved — a U

foreshadowing of the power this platform
would eventually wield — I was “the girl
who doesn’t have a Facebook.” In the three
years since that fateful day, I’ve somehow

managed to morph into “that girl who’s al- ,

ways on Facebook.”
Recently, when my 16-year-old brother
informed me of how overwhelming my

presence is on his news feed, I knew it was .

time to make a change. .

My utter lack of self-discipline and 

painfullyshort attention span are my trag-
ic ﬂaws in my battle against Mark Zuck-
erberg’s monster. I couldn’t keep myself
from typing “facebook.com” the second I
opened any web browser. I subconsciously
toyed with the Facebook app on my phone
without realizing it. p . t
_ I resented Facebook for chewing up so
much of my time — something needed to
keep me from logging in. i
This semester, at the height of my ir-
ritation, I decided to give up Facebook

7

for Lent. “Yeah right,” “doubtful” and ‘7I
give it one day” were common reactions
among those I told abut my Facebook fast.

»' The majority of people I declared my plan

to conﬁdently stated that I would never go
through with it, that I was too weakland

“addicted to endure. _ _ ,
_ The widespread skepticism was proof ’

that my technological abstinence was ab-
solutely necessary. With so many people
convinced of my imminent failure, there

was no choice but to accept my problem.

But in the received negativity, I found

iexcitement. I was determined to-‘ prove.
them wrong in my self-imposed interven-
"tion. I -

Lent is 40 days long if you don’t include
Sundays —— 46, if you do. To make this en-
deavor legitimate, I took on all 46 days.

. I_ was excited for what these days were

going to bring: I: had high hopes. The ab-' ,

sence of Facebook in my life would be
nothing short of revolutionary. I would

become diligent, attentive, productive and
“a litany of other adjectives that were never
 applicable to me.

Yet 'my,revolution was far from pro-

Even so, this long list includes only on‘-

biggest distractions, and there’s no short-

- homework. ‘ -

0 For someone with such low levels of
self—discipline, removing one of many

_ forms of communication is almost futile

and can only do so much good. But this
battle wasn’t against allmodes of distrac-
tion, and so I resolved to maintain my anti-
Facebook stance. . -

Unsurprisingly, I did have moments of
weakness that tested my resolve — mo-
ments that nearly made me break. After
all, I am only human and suffer from wants
of instant gratiﬁcation. - » .

‘I found the loss of Facebook, evenamid
other forms of amusement, was still jar-
ring from my normal routine. As with any
deviation from , consistency, I mourned.

Similar to grief, I handled the disappear— .

ance of-Facebook in stages. -

Stage One: Shock (Day 1 of 46 ‘was upon
me.) . i _ . _

I‘ deleted the Facebook app _from my
phone, removed the website from my

‘‘top sites” in Safari and announced my

departure via status update. Not seeing

that delightful, little blue square housing a
_ an “f” was unnerving. I continued to sub-
_ consciously type facebook.corn into my

browser before reality sunk —— I had to de-
fault to my.pitt.edu.
Stage one lasted two days. ‘

Stage Two: Freedom _
- I felt the metaphorical chain had been
cut from around my ankle. I was free.

» What’s a notiﬁcation? I didn’t care.

Stage two lasted four to ﬁve days. ’

Stage Three: Withdrawal

. The sad, shameful truth: I missed it.
I had been a -free bird lo_ng enough, my
wings were getting bored. Spring break ar-
rived,and my friends and I found ourselves
in Canada. This vacation’s timing —— right
in the thick of Lent -—— is not ideal for one
giving up Facebook. Post-break is a thriv-
ing period on “the Book,” and there were a
lot of things I wanted to do: stalk all of the
characters we met in Canada, look at pic-
tures from other peoples’ trips and look at
pictures from my trip over and over again
to avoid returning to reality. Standard pro-

cedure. -

’ This stage covered the days immediate-
ly before and after SB 2012 and excluded
the trip itself (mostly because I.didn’t have
Internet access across the border). '

Stage Four: Complacency do
The freedom was no longer a novelty,

but I was becoming less withdrawn. ‘Face-

, book was out of sight, out of mind for the

most part —~ I was admittedly smug be-
cause I proved the haters wrong.

Stage Five: Independence _(Note: quite
different from freedom)
The freedom one feels during stage

‘two is caused by a recent departure from

the Facebook world, and the departed is
acutely aware of this cause-and— effect rela-
tionship. Independence comes later, when
you forget you’re holding back andbegin to
regard the fast as reality.

The Facebook world stopped existing.
When I ﬁnally achieved this independence
about three-quarters of the way through
Lent, I knew that my Facebook addiction
had been mitigated. The accomplished
mental separation said that I wasn’t going
to log in to Facebook nearly as often as I
did before Lent.

At least, I hope so.

I did announce my return with astatus, f

and I’ admit I have spent plenty of time in
the past 48 hours making up for the last

month and half. But now that I feel caught.

up on all things Facebook, I’m hoping my
Stage-Five mentality will become a staple.
Yvonne Bland, mass communication
professor at Robert Morris University, led
one of her classes through a two—day tex-
ting and Facebook fast, making students
more aware of how often they turn to their

' _ phones. Bland told the Pittsburgh Post— Ga-
zette that social media “is like the oxygen

around us: we are no longer aware of it in
our daily lives.”

Bland’s-assertion is fair; I didn’t real-.

ize how often I looked at Facebook on my

phone until I deleted the application. So-.
’ cial media has ingrained itself so deeply in"
our culture that we hardly remember life

without it. __

I decided to give up Facebook for Lent
based on my perception of ‘Lent as a time
for Christians to sacriﬁce something that

they feel they cannot live without. Pathetic ‘

as it is, I was painfully aware that giving up
Facebook would be “the ultimate sacriﬁce”

-for me. With the exception of having to use

Facebook to coordinate my study abroad
travel plans'— I signed in, went straight
to the group and immediately signed out
— my suspension of Facebook lasted the
entirety of Lent.

- Honestly, I considervit a personal vic-'

tory of willpower that I managed to log in
to Facebook approximately four times and

ignore the notoriously tempting red no- ’

tiﬁcation box. That’s how “the Zuck” gets

us, you know -— with that stupid redbox, '
alluringly bright against the otherwise en-’
tirely blue Facebook layout. The notiﬁca-

tion icon would be much less enticing if it
was the same uniform blue or a less arrest-

ing color than red. . I -

Now, the colors, notiﬁcations and re-

quests are just reminders of the unhealthy f

amount of time Facebook consumed from
my life. The lesson learned was that, while
Facebook is fun, it’s absolutely expend-
able. V . V ‘A

Changing Tempo «

Exhaustion and buyouts certainly pro-
vided the death blow to the three clubs.
But during the 10-year span following the
Decade’sclosing, many less storied venues
also folded in Oakland and Pittsburgh.

Beehive and Club Laga, located on
Forbes Avenue, closed in 2002 and 2004.
Metropol and Rosebud in the Strip District
also closed in the same two years.

Zarra noted the dire condition of Pitts-

" burgh’s rock-club scene.

“The music scene was dying. There was
no more scene. The only true rock ‘n’ roll
joint in the city left. is the 31st Street Pub.
Nobody’s going to these shows. I don’t

. know where they’re going,” he said. .

Changing conditions in the music in-

dustry and Pittsburgh were factors in the

demise of the many of the city’s clubs dur-
ing those 10 years.

tional bands on attaining success by trav-
eling across the country as reason for the
present sparsity of smaller clubs.

‘At that time, groups were , traveling
more and they needed places like mine.
Now they make it big in a studio with CDs
and then, boom, theyare at the arenas.
The smaller places got caught in the mid-
dle,” he said. '

As the owner of Elko Concerts, Mike
Elko worked in concert promotion since
1986 with many Oakland venues including
Grafﬁti, Club Laga and the Beehive.,Elko
noted a generational change in the lon-
gevity of popular attention spans toward
bands as a reason for a diminished club
scene. . '

“If you look at the club scene, in the old
days, the act used to grow with every single
album. You’d start out at clubs, then you’d
go to the arenas. Now what has happened
is every band is like a one-hit wonder. The
kids move on to another act,” he said. '

‘ In the 10 years following the Decade’s
closing, the Internet exploded as the pre-

_ mier method of media. Elko cited the prev-
‘ alence of the Internet as a large distraction

for people away from live music.

“It’s all around-the country —- the same
thing has been happening. Look at social
media: Everybody can just sit on the com-
puter instead of going out and seeing a
concert. If you look at when it started hap-
pening, that’s when the computer craze
started. That’s when we started getting all
the YouTube videos and things like that,”
he said. ‘ ‘

4 These new innovations changed the way
fans experience music by allowing young
national acts to reach a global audience by
simply uploading a ﬁle, the MP3 replacing

the tour bus. According to Elko, eventually.

the younger fans picked cyberspace over
club stages. . ' . '
“Well, the younger generation, they

older generation. You have all these old-
er acts that are still the best drawing out
there. For the older music, people still go
out. They pay the hard ticket to see the
show,” he said.

Schneider found the rise of social me-

’ dia an added burden for musicians placed

by club owners.

“[Bands] have to spread all the word
on Facebook and among their friends, be-
cause the venues aren’t promoting the mu-
sic. They are relying on the bands because
they don’t want to work,” he said. H

The radio was a huge factor in promot-
ing local artists and creating a “Pittsburgh
sound” during the strength of the music
scene. Grushecky noted the importance of
these stations for the musicians.

“That- was the Pittsburgh sound in
those days. The music scene that the older
guys came out of was this real hardcore

rhythm and blues and raw rock ‘n’ roll. Be-

cause that’s what they played on the radio.
here. Every town had their own little radio
station. That was the Pittsburgh sound, it
wasn’t a Top 40 sound,” he said.

Following Congress’ passing of the Tele-
communications Act of 1996, regulations

' on radio-station purchasing were eased.

Clear Channel Broadcasting devoured the
radio industry, buying up. more than 850
radio stations in 150 different cities. The
company presently ‘owns six radio stations
in Pittsburgh.

A According to a 2007 FCC radio industry
report, from March of 1996 to 2007 the
number of commercial radio stations in

the United States increased 6.8 percent, L
despite a 39 percent decrease in the num-
ber of radio owners. ,

Grushecky credited this media con-
solidation with a less diverse selection of

music from radio stations and a reasonfor '7

change in Pittsburgh.

“The whole music industry started los-
ing steam. The playlist on radio became so
much more generic,” he said.

Pittsburgh Problems

Elko’ outlined the more tangible fea-
sibility issues for the clubs in Oakland.
Sparse parking availability hinders _ the
likelihood of any music venue thriving in
the neighborhood. '

“Oakland. has a huge parking problem
—- there is nowhere to park. Who wants to
worry about parking seven or eight blocks
away, plus worrying about whether your car
is going to get hit or vandalized? Even when '
we had Club Laga and the Beehive, there

' was always the parking issue with the city’

and the University of Pittsburgh,” he said.

The diﬂiculty of securing parking for---

artists’ tour buses’ drove’ up the booking
cost for the Oakland venues.

“If you do get parking permits, you have
to pay $15 per meter per day to the city of
Pittsburgh. Well, if you get a couplebuses
and a truck, youend up paying $200 a show
just in parking tothe city. Then you have
to raise ticket prices and you make it unaf-
fordable for a lot of people,” Elko said.

growth of Pitt was an issue for the Forbes
Avenue venues, according to Elko.

“Then when Pitt started buying stuff,
everybody tried to get extreme amounts
for rent. Well, you could only pay so much
for rent to be able to stay in business, ev-
erybody knows that,” he said.

Similarly to most of the issues that
plagued the city at the time, deindustrial-
ization played a part in the dissolving of
the music scene. Grushecky connected the
two events through the loss of afanbase
and shared culture.

“Pittsburgh changed and, once there

. was the death of the steel mills, we lost a

lot of population: People who were coming
to see us play had to move. Hard times hit
Pittsburgh pretty signiﬁcantly back in the
mid-’80s,” he said. ‘ '
According the U.S. Census, the city of
Pittsburgh’s population declined 41 per-

' cent from 1970 to 2010. The loss of jobs

scattered Pittsburghers across the country
and separated them from these venues.
The migration from Pittsburgh during
the era changed the complexion of the city.
And according to Grushecky, by the time
Pittsburgh started to recover, people spent
money on new entertainment besides live
bands. _
“Then, when it came out on the other
end, the whole culture changed. We had

MTV, cable television and video games —
everything that keeps people from going
out and seeing music now,” he said.

Elko also sees the population decline
and aging as reasons why Pittsburgh lost
so many clubs during that time period.

“First bff, therewere too many clubs
for our population and our demographic
in Pittsburgh, even still today,” he said.

The two factors also contribute to the
lack of younger national bands touring
small venues in the city.

“The amount of acts touring the club

scene is diminished. If you look at Pitts-
burgh and Cleveland, they used to be big
touring draws. Now they are towards the
bottom because we are an older demo-
graphic, so_ we don’t‘get a lot of the young-

er demographic’s music,” he said.

Grushecky noted a change in the impor-
tance of music in the city as the social scene
shifted. outside of Oakland over time.

“[Oakland] was the place to be, what
South Side is now, on a smaller scale. Oak-
land was the place where any nightlife at
all existed in Pittsburgh. Everybody was
really into the music, and it wasn’t afringe
thing like it is now. The whole city was re-
volving around the music for a while, a big
social thing,” he said.

Schneider added that some club owners
put original material as a secondary con-
cern behind crowd-drawing power.

“A lot of times, bars will put in cover
bands because they know it will draw a lot
of people, but it doesn’t really add to the
artistic integrity of the city. It’s nothing

- new, nothing really worth getting up and

going places,” he said.

b He listed the lack of media support for
local music in Pittsburgh as aconcern for
redeveloping a strong scene.

“There is no infrastructure. Don’t get
me wrong, bands are still doing it, and

- there are bands making money, but they

are doing it in spite of the scene. They
are doing it because they are just working
their butts oﬂ‘. But there really isn’t a good

internal structure. There could be so much

more,” Schneider said.

Oakland‘ remains without a showcase
club that can match the draw of those for-
mer venues. ‘

championship swagger — and it had
nothing to do with football. It did, however,
have everything to do with golf.

Growing up as the youngest of three
brothers, the idea of participating in a non-
contact sport that involved no sprinting,

diving, dunking, sliding or defense was-

considered wimpy. Certainly, it was called
things much worse than that. Watching it?
Never. , e '
But as I grew and matured, I began to
exercise patience and appreciation for the
ﬁner details of sports as the spectrum of
my fandom broadened. I started watching
tennis, reveling in the quick feet and

powerful serves of Andre Agassi and Roger.
Federer. Still, though, ,I’d dread. those .

moments when my dad took over the
remote for Sunday golf.
A Then, Tiger Woods happened. Suddenly
a charismatic, athletic-looking star who
wasn’t afraid to ﬁst pump and scream on
the green caught my attention. Yet just
.when I fell for Tiger’s swagger and the
excitement of Sunday afternoon golf, Tiger
disappeared. V ’
_ Now, even with him gone, the holiest
of golf ’s days — Sunday at the Masters ——

has still proven to be a place where mental ‘

toughness and consistency prevail. This
Sunday, the United. States’ Bubba Watson
took. ‘home his ﬁrst green jacket and
brought America to its feet with one of the
rn‘ost’exciting performances in Masters
history. As he did it, he also brought my
appreciation for golf to a climax.

You see, ‘Bubba Watsonididn’t just case at

his wayloff the tee and take a few easy
approaches to lead into a nice putt to win

the green jacket.

Instead, he ﬁrst shook off the lefty Phil
Mickelson on hole 17, leaving himself as the
last man standing with Louis Oosthuizen
at 10 under. Oosthuizen was the same guy
who hit the ﬁrst ever double—eagle in the
76-year history of the Masters. His_shot
came from 253 yards out, before rolling 90
feet backwards into the hole for_a 2.

- Then, 16 holes later, it was Watson and
Oosthuizen locked neck and neck in an
overtime playoff for golf ’s rarest prize.

Watson teed off ﬁrst and sent his ball .

sailing off into the woods. He couldn’t even
see it. When. the. dust settled and his ball
was found, Watson was sitting on a bed of
pine needles, surrounded by trees, some
’ 135 yards away from the hole. V

Oosthuizen then teed off, his shot

almost as poor as Watson’s. He was short,

on the opposite side of the green, far ‘

enough away that he actually couldn’t see
where Watson was shooting from.
- And then the shot came.

“I had no idea where he was,”
Oosthuizen said to ESPN. “Where I. stood
from, when the ball came out, it looked like

acurveball. Unbelievable shot. Thatshothe, A ‘

hit deﬁnitely won him the tournament.”

Watson’s shot was just as impressive as -

it seemed to Oosthuizen. It crept under 18-
foot high trees, turned 40 yards, traveled
another 100 yards in the air, then landed
and rolled to a position about 15 feet from
the hole. Watson’s reaction‘? a

“Hooked it about 40 yards, hit’ about

15 feet off the ground until it got under the

tree and then started rising,” Watson said. '

“Pretty easy.”

- That “pretty easy” shot was one nobody
will soon forget in the golf world. In fact,
his unorthodox style of play (birthed by the
fact that he has never had a swing coach)
that makes those shots seem so natural has
now beenjdeemed “Bubba golf.”

Watson embraces his mother in tears after winning his first Masters.

But Watson’s green jacket might not
even be the best part of his month. The
33-year—old,,from Bagdad, Fla., adopted a
son with his wife Angie just three weeks
ago after four years of trying to ﬁnd the
right ﬁt.. " -

After his unbelievable and unlikely shot
landed him 15 feet from the hole, Watson
had two putts to ﬁnish the job and win his
ﬁrst major. He played the ﬁrst one safe,
landing it just close enough for the tap in.

As he lined up the tournament-winning

' shot, Watson could hardly compose

himself. It was a girnme. Everyone knew he
would just tap it in, and"'when he did ——p the
tears started running. His emotional, tear-
ﬁlled ﬁnish got plenty of press, but nobody
could blame him.

After years of being considered a golf _

savant who didn’t care enough or want it

badly enough, Watson ﬁnally-reached his‘

ultimate dream. And he did it less than a
month after ﬁnally starting the family he
always wanted. For that, tears‘ are always

warranted. I °

With the Summer ‘Olympics quickly ap-.'

proaching, the United States will have the’.
, opportunity to put the development of its

soccer players on display for a worldwide
audience. ' ‘_ 
. At least, that was the plan.’ g _

The under-23 men’s national team lost to
El Salvador two weeks ago, erasing any pos-
sibility of its qualifying for the Games in Lon-

don. However,.the women’s national team’

qualiﬁed last month byuﬁnishing ﬁrst in The

"Confederation of North, Central American

and Caribbean Association Football. ‘

Looking at these two results, what role
does college soccer play in developing our
country’s players on both the men’s and
the women’s side?

The way college soccer operates has -

received criticism from many for its con-

'densedv season, style of play and overall

business model, all of which critics say
stunt America’s growth as a soccer power.
But Pitt men’s soccer head coach Joe Lux-
bacher' said that much of that opposition
has roots in misunderstanding of the mis-
sion of collegiate sports. ' '

A Magic tliatisfarp
' froiiitlie “NORM”!

This structure in America differs from

. how the rest of the world goes about devel-

oping players.

In professional soccer‘ powerhouse
countries like Spain, Italy and Germany,
professional clubs have youth academies
that they can recruit or sign players to at
a young age. In these academies, develop-

A ment is the main purpose. Wins and losses

are de-emphasized. The separation of sport
and school in other countries means that
people aren’t looking” at high-level youth
sports as the golden ticket to a college edu-
cation, but rather asbuilding blocks for a
professional career.

Not only that, but pickup soccer is much
more common in other places than in the
United States. Luxbacher talked about how

. pickup teaches players how to play cre-

.atively and improvise.’ The play of Ameri-
cans, according to Luxbacher, becomes va-
nilla and lacks imagination because most
don’t play in these environments.

“The goals are different,” Luxbacher ‘

added.
According to usyouthsoccer.org, the
United States isn’t looking at the registered

‘ athletes playing youth soccer and trying to

determine who is destined for glory.
In Europe, adolescents have to choose
between goingto college and pursuingapro-
fessional career. Luxbacher doesn’t agree
with such an approach, but as he points out,_
the aims of each setup are different.-

for topdrawersoccer.com, expressed simi-

play in college, citing a number of Division

soccer,‘ but just three of those did sofor
more than two years.

Part of the reason‘ Eskilson foresees _

the pro game moving away from, the col-
lege ranks as a feeding groundis because

Major League Soccer teams have begun to”

increase their role in communities through
youth academies.

The shift is by no means complete. As i

it stands now, college soccer still provides
many of the MLS’s players — all 38 of the
players "selected in the 2012 -SuperDraft
came from Division I colleges. _

But according to Eskilson, the top players
have started choosingprofessional contracts
over acollege education. Luxbacher himself
said that a couple of players he recruited in
the past year chose to pursue careers in Eu-
rope instead of playing in college.

“For developing top, players, the‘ Eu-
ropean system is better,” Luxbachersaid.
“They’re trying from the get—go to prepare
players [in order] to get that select group
that’s going to be their national team.”

Caleb Porter coached the men’s team
during its unsuccetssfuliolympic qualifying

campaign this past March. He is the head "

coach of Akron’s men’s soccer team, which
he has developed into a national power-

hous_e, winning the 2010 national cham-

pionship‘ and" ﬁnishing ‘as the national
runner—up in 2009. He has sent 14\players
on to the MLS. Hiskhiring by U.S. Soccer to

_ lead the Olympic campaign sends a deﬁnite

message, according to Eskilson. A
“Basically what they’re saying is, ‘Look,

this is the way we want teams to play 
We’re encouraged by this,”’ Eskilson said.
“You can "read the writing on the wall ‘
now.” '

Prior to his appointment as U—23 head‘
coach, Porter served as an assistant coach
on the U-18 national team for the last three
years. ‘

Luxbacher, who has coached at Pitt for
28 years, stressed that he doesn’t see his
job ﬁrst and foremost as developing pro-
fessionals.

“It’s not like. [Pitt women’s soccer head
coach] Greg Miller or I make a professional
player,” Luxbacher said. “You can’t make a
professional. You can guide him there if he
has the tools.”

With the recent folding of Women’s Pro-
fessional Soccer, the top level for women as-
piring to turn professional, the college game
is now, arguably, that much more important.

College haslbeen a necessity for the top
American women’s players. The instability

, of a professional league in the United States

has made the act of bypassing college in-
credibly rare.

Each of the players on the women’s na-
tional team played college soccer and used
all four years of their eligibility.

“There continues to be, year after year,

- more and more talented‘ kids coming up

through the youth ranks,” Miller said. “Once

they get to college game, it is imperative for
the development of our national team and
to remain a world power that we continue
to develop them in the college game.”

On the men’s side, it is a detriment be-
cause the best players can just bypass that
level if they want, which leaves college soc—‘
cer, many times, with a lower quality player.
Even those players that do go to college can
choose to go pro after a couple years and still
have structure (in lower—level pro leagues)
that allows them to continue to develop.

With the women, the best college play— ‘

ers are the best players, period. Since there
isn’t a stable pro option for women,.col—
lege coaches have more developmental re-

sponsibilities. If women’s college coaches .

don’t put development as one of their main

goals, our women’s national team won’t

be as successful as it has been. The men’s

game doesn’t have that much pressure on
it because players, if they want, have ways
in which to further their game at a profes-

sional level. Consequently, many college

programs just focus onwins and losses at
whatever the cost aesthetically.
On both the men’s and the women’s

sides, the scheduling layout of collegiate *

soqcer is seen as negatively affecting the
development of players. The season is con-
densed into two to three months’ worth
of games, which makes it hard to focus on
development when you are metaphorically
sprinting from day one.

“If you look at the women’s game,
there’s a discrepancy between the athletes.
Certain coaches compensate for that by

packing the box or putting more people
