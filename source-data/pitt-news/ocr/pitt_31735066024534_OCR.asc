Students, O’Connor debate course evaluations

By Julie Sabol

News Assistant

The creation of a course-
evaluation form that would serve
as a “consumer report” for
students was discussed at
yesterday’s Student Government
Board open forum.

Pitt President J. Dennis O’
Connor said he supported new
course—evaluation surveys but
questioned the logistics of
distributing them.

Although it would be desirable
for the SGB to conduct all the
surveys, “simply due to lack of
manpower” it is impossible, SGB
President Gil Golden said. He
proposed a joint effort by the
SGB, administration and students
to make sure all courses are
evaluated.

About 4,000 course evaluations
are currently done each term,
they are not beneficial because
such a small percentage of courses
are reviewed and the results are

State senator will fight
military law-school ban

By Michael King
For The Pitt News

State Sen. Mike Fisher will ask
PittPresidentJ. Dennis O’Connor
to lift the ban on military recruiters
at the law school.

Fisher has decided to appeal to
O’Connor after unsuccessfully
petitioning Pitt Law School Dean
Mark Nordenberg, who instituted
the ban last fall after meeting
with the Student Bar Association,
the Women’s Law Association
and the Gay Rights Organization.

These groups said the
Department of Defense policy
prohibiting gays and lesbians from
enlisting was discriminatory and
did not adhere to the law school’s
anti—discriminatory policies.

Fisher became involved in this
issue after corresponding with
the Pitt student group Concerned
Students for Equal Access. This
group is the majoropponent of
the ban on military recruitment in
the law school.

Nordenberg was unavailable
for comment on Fisher’s plans to
speak to O’Connor.

CSEA said Fisher is prepared to
back legislation which would
force the law school to lift its ban
on military recruiters.

Gay Rights Organization
Secretary Christine Biancheria
said Nordenberg is very firm
about his policy and pressure
from Fisher and CSEA will not
bring about any change.

“For every Senator Fisher there
is another person in a position of
authority who would favor the
ban,” Biancheria said.

The law school’s ban does not
prohibit law students from
working for the military. It forces
them _to go outside law-school
facilities to meet with recruiters.

CSEA member Tim Krieger said,
“What the military is doing is not
illegal. Therefore, it is wrong for
a publicly funded law school to
take such a stand.”

The controversy surrounding
the military—recruiter ban is not
limited to Pitt’s campus. Similar
bans were instituted at the
University of Virginia, Northern
Illinois University at DeKalb and
Washington and Lee University.

The recruiter ban at UVA was
lifted because of pressure from a
student group similar to CSEA
and the fear of possible legislation.
At NIU and WLU, the ban was
lifted as _a result of state legislative
action.

not made public, Golden said.
Until 1983, Pitt did publish
portions of the evaluations, but
there were difficulties involved.
“First, faculty members had to
give permission for items to be
published, and they didn’t get
published at a time that was
useful,” said Carol Baker, director
of measurement and evaluation.
To protect students, evaluations
are not returned until a course is
over, and by this time, students
have already registered for the

next term, Baker said. “lt takes a
lot of work and money,” Baker
said.

“If we have consistency, then I
don’t think money or work would
be the main issues,” Golden
countered.

For the past year and a half,
Associate Provost jack Daniel
has been working with
administrators to instill mandatory
undergraduate course

evaluations, but “it’s one thing to

Foram explores abortion rights in Pennsylvania

By Gary Knapick
Senior Staff‘ Writer

As the daughter of the doctor who opened
the first abortion clinic in North Carolina,
Candice Hoke grew up among the early
battles of the pro-choice movement. Hoke
said that her father’s clinic, which was fire-
bombed once, still remains a target of anti-
abortion groups such as Operation Rescue.

“We’ve lived through these battles,” said
Hoke, soon to become an associate professor
at Pitt Law School.

Hoke was part of a roundtable discussion
on abortion yesterday sponsored by the
women’s studies department.

Hoke, who said that her contact with the
women who came to her father’s clinic
ultimately influenced her decision to attend
law school, spoke on recent court rulings
central to the pro-choice movement.

__ I-_lok_e_ expressed h€t.diSS9.tiSf9.CLiOt1___Vj/_l|_l,l'_l

the decision record of Supreme Courtjustice
Sandra Day O’Connor, who Hoke described
as “the bane of women’s existence.”

O’Connor believes that the precedent-
setting Roe vs. Wade decision should be
diluted and that abortion is a limited right,
according to Hoke.

This ideology is rapidly gaining acceptance
among the other justices of the Supreme
Court. According to Hoke, the a woman's
right to an abortion is losing significance in
the eyes of judges. “They’re saying that it’s a
small right, that it’s not a fundamental right,”
Hoke said.

Hoke went on to say the Reagan-Bush
years have left the courts of the United States
stacked with “judges committed to
overturning Roe.”

Mary Litman of Pittsburgh Women’s Health
Services said repeated actions by anti-abortion
groups, who have picketed, blockéfclled and

abortion clinic, have not swayed the facility
from its mission.

“We remain committed  to providing
quality health care to the women of
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.”

Litman criticized the Pennsylvania Abortion
Control Act for limiting the accessibility of
abortions in Pennsylvania.

“lncreasingly, we have seen the erosion of
women’s rights, particularly in the areas of
abortion and birth control,” Litman said. “The
decision once between a woman and her
doctor has become a political issue.”

The act discourages women from having
abortions by mandating that they read an
illustrated pamphlet on fetal development
and wait 24 hours before undergoing the
procedure, Litman said. “The law insinuates
that women are not good decision-makers.
We know that women are capableyof making

legislation

State Rep. Ron Cowell said
the Higher Education Fiscal
Disclosure Act introduced
in the state senate Tuesday
“falls far short” ofhis House
Bill 1075, which would open

the financial records of state- _

related universities.

Cowell (D.—Wilkins)
sponsored the bill that
passed the house 202-] last
year and would allow for
almost unlimited public
access to’ documents at Pitt
and Temple, Lincoln and
Penn State universities.

But The Higher Education
Fiscal Disclosure Act,
proposed by Sen. James
Rhoades (R.—Schuylkill),
would only require limited
disclosure of financial
information. The salaries of
only the highest—paid
university employees would
be revealed under Rhoades’
bill, as well as “median and
mean” salaries for
employees by rank and job
classification.

Repeated phone calls to
Rhoades’ office were
unanswered.

“I’m happy on one hand
that Sen. Rhoades has tried
to address the issue,” Cowell
said. “But l’rn disappointed
with the approach. I'm going

to continue to maintain that .

House Bill 1075 is a far
better approach.”

The University of
Pittsburgh had proposed
amendments for House Bill
1075 that are “far too
extensive,” according to
Cowell. He would not
further specify what the
university had asked to
change, but President _I.
Dennis O’Connor has said
Cowell’s bill
endanger research at Pitt.

“The university should be
treated like a public
institution,” Cowell said. But
Rhoades’ legislation
assumes that state-related
universities are private,
according to Cowell.

“lRhoades’ bill] does
provide for certain

‘information to be put in

By Tara Harris

 For The Pitt News

At yesterday's Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Council meeting,
Geology Professor Victor Schmidt
asked the university to provide
its students and faculty with more
modern computer facilities.

“We’re in pretty good shape

I now, but we definitely need to

upgrade as time goes on,”
‘Schmidt said.
Schmidt

discussed the

I advantages of having I-1-Mail and

PittCAT available to students and
faculty. He said other resources,
such as a graphics lab, would
also be useful on campus.

FAS Dean Peter Koehler said
that although Schmidt's proposal
sounded like a “positive vision,”
using university funds to
implement it would be difficult.

Massachusetts Institute of
Technology has a $50 million
computer networking system and
has a diversity of hardware,

 

  AS Council discusses
university computers

Schmidt said. “Hardware is not a
major expenditure," he said.

The committee also discussed
more convenient computer-
accessing locations for students.
FAS Dean of Graduate Studies
Mary Louise Soffa said, “Students
should be able to access other
computers through the dorms.”
Koehler said the new dorm will
have a computer lab in the lobby.

“Revolutionary technological
changes are coming, and Pitt
would be wise to take advantage
of them," Schmidt said.

Soffa said the graduate studies
department is distributing a
newsletter in February for
graduate students. Faculty
members also discussed FAS
committee nominees in the
humanities, natural sciences and
social sciences.

Nominees considered were
professors Ann Harris (fine arts),
Lynn Emanuel (English), Don

Apartments, crosswozl/es
concern local residents

By Lori Bossert
For The Pitt News

North Oakland residents voiced their concerns about
dilapidated apartment buildings and insufficient crosswalks to
City Council member Dan Cohen at a town meeting Tuesday
night.

Angry residents complained about the growing numbers of
rundown apartments occupied by students and the problem
of absentee landlords.

This makes it almost impossible to insist the buildings be
properly maintained, they said.

Cohen told the residents that under a proposed city ordinance
landlords would be required to register with the city. Any
building with more than three units would be required to have
an on-site manager, and community groups would have to be
notified of any public hearings concerning North Oakland
property.

The need for walk signals at the Forbes Avenue and South
Craig Street and Forbes Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard
intersections was discussed. ,

These intersections, which currently have no walk
signals, -were considered dangerous by many who
attended.

Citizens also expressed a need for a greater number of
audible walk signals in Oakland, as well as longer signals at
busy intersections, including Fifth Avenue and Craig

English professor specias in

By Eric Engman
For T be Pitt News

Professor James Knapp has
‘taught in Germany and lived in
London, but Pittsburgh is where
he is planning to spend the rest of
his career.

“I can’t imagine a better place
to live,” said Knapp, 51, who
walks two miles to campus from
Squirrel Hill every day to teach
English literature. “I plan to do
that until the day I drop."

Knapp was born in Chicago in
1940, but he considers himself a
New Jersey native. He lived in
Indianapolis when he was a
young boy.

He started high school in St.
Louis, then moved to New Jersey
to finish high school and attend
Drew University. Knapp
graduated from'Drew in 1962,
and by I966 he had his doctorate
in modern English literature from
the University of Connecticut.

Knapp taught at the University
of Au gsburg in Germany for three
months in 1987 through an
exchange program. “German
students loved him just as much
as American students,” said Bruce
Dobler, who worked with Knapp
in Germany. A

While in Germany, Dobler and
Knapp did a lot of walking
together. “He surprised the

Germans because they think
Americans always take cars,”
Dobler said.

Knapp said he enjoys walking,
hiking and playing tennis. He
said he attends many conferences
all over the world, and he goes
early so he can go hiking before
the conference.

One of his favorite memories is
walking the 30—mile trail the

' pilgrims of Canterbury traveled

in the famous story The
Canterbury Tales.

Knapp’s interests in high school
included astronomy, physics and
theater ratherthan literature.‘ He
said he participated in a lot of
plays when he was in high school
in St. Louis.

“On the whole, I didn’t like
high school,” Knapp said. But he
liked college, and it was there
where he developed an interest
in English literature. He now
teaches both medieval literature
and modern literature, but most
of his publications and his
research deal with modern
literature.

‘ Knapp came to the University
of Pittsburgh in 1966, as an
assistant professor. His first class,
a medieval literature class of 120
students, was held in a biology
lab.

Res1dent ass1stants undergo 1ntens1ve 1nterv1eWs

By Gregory Rea
For T be Pitt News

Becoming a resident assistant
at Pitt isn’t the easiest thing in the

' world to do. Dealing with 20 to
» 40 different personalities and a

constant flow of noise isn’t
everyone’s idea of fun.

But many students said the
positives far outweigh the
negatives. On-campus housing,
$5,000 or more in free room and
board and the opportunity to
meet and inﬂuence new people
were all reasons for applying.

“It would really help me
financially,” said Jon Brisar, a

sophomore chemical engineering
major applying to be an RA.

“More importantly, I would be
able to help students who really
don’t know what university life is
really like,” he said. “Itwould be
nice to be an important role
model to other students.”

The process of becoming an
RA starts with an application that
must be turned in with letters of
recommendation. from one faculty
member and another person the
applicant chooses.

This year more students picked
up applications to be RAs than
ever before, but 30 less female
students turned in applications

than last year. The Office of-

Residence I.ife had no real
explanation for the drop—off,
especially since the new dorms
may increase the number of RAs
hired this year.

Within a week or two the
difficult steps of becoming a RA
really starts. The second step is a
group interaction session. Five or
six applicants are interviewed in
a group setting by four RAs and
one central staff member. They
look for the applicants to be
assertive, to have poise and
maturity, to express their views
or opinions clearly and to interact
with the group easily.

“The first interview is somewhat
difficult,” Brisar said. “Ifyou come
in nervous and can’t relax, then
you could blow the entire
interview. Not to mention, you
need to be able to effectively
communicate with four other
people that you’ve never met
while trying to impress the
evaluation team.”

During the group interview the
applicants must work together to
rank 16 words in order of
importance. From the 16 words
they choose five to create an
advertisement to entice students
to apply to be an RA. The group
does a quick presentation and
explains the reasoning for the
choices made.

“You have to work well with
people in your group,” said Eric
Emenheiser, a junior who is
applying to be an RA. “After all,
it's one of the most important
parts of becoming an RA. The
decisions are made very quickly,
and you need to justify and
support them.”

The evaluation team grades the
applicants from one to_ four.
Afterwards, the team discusses
the qualifications of each
applicant to see if there are any
widely conflicting views. If
applicants score high enough,
they are invited back for a second
interview. '

“In thefirst interview I look for
someone who seems responsible
and will take the job seriously,”

Tower B. “The applicants really
need to be open—minded to other
people.”

In the second part one male
applicant and one female
applicant are invited back to
interview in front of another
evaluation team so applicants
don’t feel the need to compete
against each other for a position.

“I’m looking forward to the
second interview more than the
first,” Brisar said. “The second
interview provides the evaluation
team with a better chance to
learn and understand what the
individual person is really like.”

The interview starts off with a

few simple ice-breakers, and then

« the team asks more in-depth

questions. Sometimes the
applicants are asked what they
would do if a student came to
them and said he or she was
homosexual. Later the evaluation
team adds that the same student
has a crush on his or her
. roommate.

“We really look for someone
who can work with a diverse
group of people on their floor
and with the staff,” said Cheryl

‘ Campbell, the area director for

the Office of Residence Life.
“They must also be aware of the
_time commitment involved with
the job.”

The applicants are graded
again, and the final decision is
left to Campbell. Within a few
weeks the applicant receives a

malted beer made from honey,
and it was very popular in
medieval times.

In the classroom Knapp said
he tries to get his students
involved in the class and in the
discussion.

Knapp likes a “balance
between mini-lectures and
discussion. This is hard because
a lot of classes are large,” Knapp
said, “but that’s what I want to
do.”

Knapp said he wants to get
across his excitement about what
he teaches but give his students
enough space to have their own
interpretations. ,

He is generally pleased with
the way his students respond to
his teaching methods. “I wish I
could teach more classes.” But
the administrative work that
accompanies his job as director
of graduate studies takes a lot of
time-

Steve Parks, one of Knapp’s
graduate students, speaks very
highly of him. “He acts ve_ry
concerned about his students,”
Parks said.

Parks, who has had Knapp far
many classes as an undergraduate
and a graduate student, said has
a good idea of the type of person
Knapp is as a professor and as a
person. »

“He really knows his stuff. He’s
nice, but he’s not going to let you
float by,” Parks said.

Parks said “among the grad
students and among the faculty,
Knapp is well respected.”

§ THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 30, 1992
HEMP works toward

more campus Visibility

By Eric Engman
For T be Pitt News

Help End Marijuana Prohibition
is planning to become more
visible on campus this term,

according to founder Dan-

Waterman.

The group has discussed
reserving the front balcony of the
William Pitt Union for an “open
microphone” to allow speakers
and the public to voice their
opinions about the legalization
of marijuana.

HEMP is planning to set up a
table on the ground floor of the
union after spring break to sell T-
shirts, bracelets made out of the
fiber of the marijuana stem, pins
and books. Group members will
also hand out flyers and other
information about the uses of the
hemp plant.

“One of the main forms of
information we have been passing
out is environmental," Waterman

50°/o

said. -

The group is planning a table
in the Towers lobby with
informational flyers, a HEMP rally
to be held the end of April at the
Federal Building downtown and
attending a Mawa Festival
sometime over the summer.

HEMP is not officially affiliated
with the Mawa Festival, but group
members attended the festival
last year and had a good turnout
of interested people.

The group is also planning to
visit local malls to hand out
information. “[Mallsl are middle-
class America, and those are the
ones who need convincing,”
according to Waterman. He said
he wants Americans to know that
the marijuana plant can be used
for fabric, fuel, paper, food and
medicine.

HEMP meets every other
Tuesday at 7 p.m. in Room 510 in
the WPU. The next meeting will
be held Tuesday, Feb. 11.

have evaluations for the benefit of the professors, for the
professors to learn from, and it’s another thing to have evaluations
done by undergraduates for undergraduates,” he said.

In Golden's proposed plan, the SGB and faculty would agree
on five to 10 additional questions designed to be made public,
while the rest of the review would remain confidential.

Both Golden and O’Connor agree starting with a small
number ofCAS elective courses to monitor would be a good first
step in the program.

“Now the 5GB must explain the use to which they want to put
the data. They should work to convince the faculty of the
benefits to convince them the new program is worth a shot.
We’d have to come to an agreement useful and informative to
all of us. You couldn't force the faculty to do anything,” Provost
Donald Henderson said.

A problem with students is that they "accept too much,”
Daniel said. “Students should never tolerate inadequacy in the
classroom. First they should speak with the faculty member,
then the chair of the department, and keep moving up. We have
to work together on this," he said.

In order to improve teaching, the evaluations must get back
to the instructors and be reviewed by the chairs of the
department, according to O'Connor. “I think it can be done,” he
said.

“A consumer guide for students — that's what you really want.
The issue is how you get that kind of guide,” Daniel said.

Linda Jarrett, a transfer student from a school that had course
evaluations similar to those SGB has proposed, “found them
very useful and helpful. There’s alot of reasons students need
it. We do have a right to know and look over the material.”

“As yet we still don’t have a mechanism to start this project,
but I think we have an agreement between the necessary

administrators that we’re addressing a very relevant issue. The ,

question is, where do we go from’ here? “ Golden said.

Pedestrians are given about 45
seconds to cross the street, which
some citizens said was insufficient
for blind pedestrians.

Cohen promised residents that
at least three new audible walk
signals would be in operation by
early May.

He took the names of other
unsafe intersections and assured
citizens he would take steps to
correct the problems.

“This is one case where citizen
input has really helped,” Cohen
said. ‘

The proposed Oakland
Historical district was also
discussed at the meeting.

Pittsburgh’s Historic Review
Commission and the City Planning
Commission have voted to create
the district.

“Oakland, unlike Downtown
Pittsburgh, was designed as a
grand center of western
Pennsylvania,” said John
DeSantis, current chairperson
of ' the Historic Review
Commission.

The ﬁnal steps in designation
will be a public hearing on the
issue and permission from City
Council.

In keeping with historical
preservation issues, Cohen also
announced that a “Spring Graffiti
Clean-Up Day” will be held for
the first time this year.

Although the date for the event
has not yet been finalized, it will
occur sometime in the early
spnng.

Volunteers will be provided
with solvent which removes
graffiti from building walls.

 Assocz'atz'on’s director tries to link alumni to university

.I

By Franco Bonacchi
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh has over
170,000 alumni located throughout the
country, and that number increases by
about 5,000 each year. To coordinate the
activities of these thousands of people
across the nation, Leland Patouillet was
hired last year as the alumni association’s
new executive director.

Patouillet said he welcomed the
challenge of turning Pitt’s alumni program
into one of the top programs in the
country.

“Here at Pitt I think we have a good
program that can really become great, and
I think itwas the opportunity and challenge
that really brought me here,” he said.

Patouillet came to Pitt from the University
of South Florida, where he graduated from

in 1975. Since 1986, he served as the '

executive director of South Florida’s alumni
program, which was voted third best in
the countryin the spring of 1991.

But that success was part of the reason
Patouillet decided to leave South Florida
and take the same position at Pitt. He said
he felt he had done all that could be done
with South Florida’s alumni program and
the time was right to move on to something
new.

According to Patouillet, the main function
of any alumni association is to connect the
alumni back to their alma mater.

“T 00 many times alumni associations
are out of sync with what the real needs
are for the university. The bottom line of
why you have alumni associations is to
generate support for the university. But
you have to know that this has to be a two-
way street where you have to provide

services and beneﬁts to help link alumni
back to the university,” Patouillet said.

The process of linking alumni back to
the school involves four basic steps,
according to Patouillet.

The first step is simply to identify as
many alumni as possible and keep track of
them, which Patouillet says can be very
difficult when up to 50 percent of alumni
movento new locations.

Second, the identified alumni must
receive a variety of school-based
publications that will inform them about
the current affairs of the university.

Third, the alumni must become involved
with the school. “Once you involve people,
I think you create a sense of ownership
and a greater sense of pride develops,”
Patouillet said.

‘‘I think you involve people through
alumni clubs, and we have about 40 clubs
located throughout the country. We are
about to go international with our club
program,” Patouillet said.

The fourth and final step is to have the
alumni invest their resources back into the
university. “The investment is through
their time and money and certainly their
inﬂuence, counsel and advice. Their time
and effort is just as important as their
money.

“Then there is the whole role of alumni
advocacy, which is being informed about
your alma mater and providing a
perspective from an alumnus that only an
alumnus can provide. After all they are
products, and if the university closed
tomorrow, the only thing that would be
left of its legacy is really the alumni. They
are indeed out best advertising,” Patouillet
said.

He said his goal is to work with university

administrators and alumni leaders in order
to turn Pitt’s alumni program into one of
the best in the country.

One program designed to help
accomplish this is a student alumni
association, the Blue and Gold Society.

“The purpose of a student alumni
association is to really serve as ambassadors
of goodwill to the university community,”

_ Patouillet said. “The association would be

made up oftop student leaders and would
represent Pitt at major events to the students
and alumni,” Patouillet said.

A program like the Blue and Gold
Society could help undergraduate students
become more aware of the alumni program
while they are still in school.

“It is ironic that we as alumni—association

"professionals, not only at Pitt but all over

the place, ignore the students while they
are here, but once they become alumni we
talk about how important they are although
we paid no attention to them,” Patouillet
said.

He hopes that this program will help
change thatby identifying potential alumni
leaders while they are still students.

Alumni associations have to become
much more entrepreneurial and begin
raising much more of their own operation
budget in addition to the support received
from the university, he said. ’

“Alumni associations around the country
are raising more and more money
themselves because they realize that the
university does not have it. And if we are
going to do the kind of programs and
services that we need to, we have to help
raise those funds,” Patouillet said.

One major priority of the alumni
association for the upcoming year is to
work with President J. Dennis O’Connor

and the school administration to develop
a five-year strategic plan.

According to Patouillet, the main purpose
of the strategic plan will be to review all
the existing programs of the alumni
association and eventually identify new
ideas. It will determine the directions the
alumni association needs to pursue and
develop in the next five years.

This will be the second five—year plan by
Pitt’s alumni association. In 1987, the
association created a plan whose primary
goal was to establish an extensive network
of Pitt clubs over the country.

At that time there were only three Pitt
clubs based in the local area, but because
of the success of that plan, there are about
40 Pitt clubs nationwide today.

Patouillet said O’Connor will play an \

important part in the development of the
strategic plan because he will help decide
how the university’s needs will be
represented in the overall plan.

“He is in the process ofdrafting back to
us what he sees as the key priorities and
how the alumni associationcan help,”
Patouillet said. Although it is still too early
to know the focus of this plan, student
recruitment will be one of O’Connor’s
primary Concerns, according to Patouillet.

Final approval of the plan will come,

next May at the annual alumni—association
meeting.

Clearly Patouillet and the association
staff have high ambitions for their
organization, which fits in perfectly with
Patouillet’s philosophy toward his job:
“l-ligh goals yield high results.”

‘‘I’m a big believer in the power of
positive thinking, and I think it is important
to set goals aggressively and then go out
and work hard to achieve them,” he said.

Acting, singing wins Talent Show

show with a wide selection of enter the show, they said.

By Heather York
For The Pitt News

Sophomore theater major
Marietta Pacella won first place
and $200 at the Pitt Program
Council’s talent show last night
for her acting and singing.

“lam completely shocked,” said
Pacella, whose performance came
at the end ofthe three-hourshow.
“I love being on stage, and this
was perfect.”

The talent show, part of Pitt
Program Council’s Meltdown ’92,
featured 20 student acts, including
bands, soloists, dancers and
storytellers.

‘‘It went great,” said Jane Hays,
special events committee member
at PPC. “We had a very interesting

performances.”

Second place and 3100 went to
Rudy Chichlow and Eric Nixon,
members of a steel band that
received the only standing ovation
of the evening.

The audience sang along to
Chicklow as he played a medley
of what he called “fun tunes” on
his steel drum. The set included
themes from “The Muppet Show,”
“'I'he Brady Bunch,” “The
Flintstones” and “Mario Brothers.”

“This is just phenomenal,”
Chicklow said. Nixon, who played
a drum set, said the duo got
together when Nixon heard
Chicklow playing his steel drum
in his dorm room in Lothrop Hall.
People on their floor told them to

Spare Change and the folk duo
Crackpipe tied for third place.
Each band received $50.

Spare Change had broken up
and reunited just for the talent
show. Guitarist Michael Snyder
said the results gave the band a
great chance to get back together
again.

Klayton Kendall and Justin
Chimka, the members of
Crackpipe, drew an enthusiastic
response from a dwindling
audience at the end of the evening
with “Raspberry Beret,” “Jet Plane”
and “She Drives Me Crazy.” The
duo’s response to their prize was
simply, “We have won the cold

make the decision to have an abortion frivolously.”

Litrnan described provisions of the act that require minors to
attain the permission of their parents as “Teenage Endangerment
Laws” and said that such stipulations would not increase family
openness.

“Teens have an uncanny way of looking at their families and
knowing what kind of response an unexpected pregnancy
would be met with,” Litman said. “When some of [the young
women who come to the clinic] say ‘My father would kill me,’
many mean it.” A I

Litman stressed the necessity of easily accessible abortions
for teenagers. “We don’t want our teenagers to hit the road like
they do now in Ohio. We don’t want them to have to get up at
4 a.m. to drive to Maryland or wherever,” Litrnan said. ‘

Other provisions of the act, including reporting requirements
for clinics, are designed to hassle and financially burden
abortion clinics and forestall abortion procedures, according to
Litman. ‘

Litman said much ofthe act was nothing more than “legalized
harassment” and that it placed additional burdens on the most
vulnerable women." She concluded by saying that pro—choice
marches, like the one to be held in Washington on April 5, are
the most-effective means of “showing the country that _we’ll
never go back.”

Susan Hansen of the political science department said that
her study of abortion and related policies across the United
States demonstrated the limits of laws as mechanisms of
change.

In the course of her study, Hansen discovered that tremendous
variation existed in abortion rates, which range from five of
every. 1,000 women in Wyoming to 46 of every 1,000 in
California. -

Hansen said her study revealed that legislation that restricts
abortion has little or no effect on the abortion rate of a state.

No more surprises

Registration for fall 1992 will begin on March 16. After the
usual appointments with advisers, students will venture
on up to Thackeray Hall to register for classes.

The eager students arrive exactly when the doors open.
Excited and duly registered, they leave pleased with all
classes accounted for.

But the first day of class can bring many surprises — a
favorite class selection may turn out to be the dreaded
nightmare of the upcoming semestergstudents are left
scrambling for special-perrnission slips from secretaries
and teaching assistants.

Students need critical information to evaluate their choice
of courses before they register.

Every semester, students pour over the information
contained in the College of Arts and Sciences Course
Description Guide. It can read like Egyptian hieroglyphics.

And in this case, brevity is not the soul of wit.

All you can expect from the guide is the course’s name

’ and number. The “description,” while useful, does not

necessarily reﬂect the course content.

Vital courseinformation is still missing. Students wait
until the first day of class for book prices and class
requirements. ,

One option for students would be to discuss a prospective
course with an instructor; however it may not be realistic.

Alternatively, before students register for each course,
departments could make available additional information
to students. _ _ S

Class expectations should be clearly outlined by every
department. A class syllabus could be provided to enable
students to make a better choice.

. Factors also outlined in a syllabus include test type, class-
attendance policies and a bibliography. In retrospect, the
CAS Course Description Guide can be terribly misleading
when comparing an instructor’s syllabus and the guide’s
synopsis. -

In an attempt to remedy the instructor-information gap,
the suggestion offered by the Student Government Board
and its president, Gil Golden, to initiate student evaluations
that would compile such information should be supported.

Independent of the Office of Measurement and
Evaluation, instructor reviews could be published in an
easy reference guide.

The compilations,‘ acting as a “consumer report” for
students seeking additional information, are an attractive
idea and an ideal project for the SGB to spearhead.

Considering_the amount of money and time invested by
university students, this information is essential.

A concerted effort by the Student Government Board,
faculty and administration could produce a guide which
could vastly improve the state of education at Pitt by
requiring instructors to be more accountable to their
students. ' '

Studs, suds and Swedish bikinis

Just imagine ﬁve rough, tough
and macho outdoorsmen
escaping from their wives and
families for the weekend, sitting
around a campfire frying up the
catch of the day, chewing tobacco
and telling big—boobs jokes.

It doesn’t get any better than
this. '

Except when a handful of busty,
blond, bikinied women drops
out of the sky, it gets better  or
does it? _

The Swedish Bikini Team is the
most blatant and distasteful
example of sexism to hit the tube
yet. These Old Milwaukee beer
commercials by parent company
Stroh Brewing have caused
women to do more than change
the channel— some have stepped
forward to charge the
commercials are responsible for
sexual harassment in the
workplace.

Four female employees of Stroh .

Brewing Company have ﬁled a
lawsuit against Stroh claiming they
have been subjected to obscene
and sexist comments,
pornographic magazines and
posters, slaps on the buttocks
and male co—workers following
them home.

The uniqueness of this case is
that the women argue that Stroh’s
advertising gave men the go-
‘ahead for their actions.

Aside from the posters of

Megan
Bertino

scantily clad women that decorate
the factory, the employees put
heavy blame on the Swedish
Bikini Team. ,

And why not?

Stroh is encouraging sexual
inequality, among employees by
reducing women to their most
base form asdisproportionately

figured bimbos who drop in to

be mere sex toys for those
“fortunate” men.

Of course- Stroh denies a
correlation between its ads and
the behavior of its employees.

Yet Stroh recognizes that sex
can turn even the most metallic-
tasting beer into a hot
commodity.

Men will usually buy cheap,
bland beer if it is promoted by
women with breasts large enough
to nurse a whale.

Demeaning women in heavily
circulated television ads as well
as displaying posters of scantily
clad women in the workplace
creates an environment where
women are not taken seriously.
These ads fuel threats and
intimidation.

Stroh cannot guard against
sexual harassment when the

company is promoting it.
Locker—room pinups, thinly
disguised as advertisements, are
not acceptable in the workplace.
These ads promote a negative
image of women, and they feed
the stereotype that it is acceptable
to treat women as objects.
While Stroh continues to deny
this, these four women stand as
proof. A
Butt-slapping and following
women home are dangerous

consequences of harassment on '

the job.

Stroh has a right to free speech
as much_as anyone else, but
sometimes it’s difficult to
distinguish between free speech
and sexual harassment.

The argument that the
commercial isa parody meant to
make fun of other sexist beer

commercials is ridiculous because . t

the Swedish Bikini Team takes
exploitation to a new limit.

It is unfortunate that Stroh
refuses to respect its women
employees.

Ultimately it should be Stroh’s’

decision to pull the ad, The
Swedish Bikini Team might be
Stroh’s idea of a clever satire on
sexist advertising, but the
company is just another sheep in
the sexist herd. '

Board’s decision not ‘travesty’

I would like to applaud the Student [Government]
Board's decision to appoint Melissa Smith to fill the
vacant seat on the board. She has proven herself
worthy through her involvement in various
university services and by the leadership positions
that she has held. Melissa Smith was definitely the
most qualified person running for thelempty slot.

I am sure that Melissa, a woman
with experience in the university’s
governingsystem, realizes that
her responsibility is to represent

the entire student body. Her past involvement with
BiGALA does not mean that all her decisions
concerning university issues will be biased toward
I the homosexual community. Her resignation from
her position in BiGALA indicates that she is willing

gay community has been discriminated [against] on
this campus for far too long and it is time for a

We all need to drop the pretenses that infer that
homosexuals are less than the general public; they
deserve the same rights that
blacks, Christians and Rep-
ublicans, to name a few, do. If
Melissa had been a member of
the Black Action Society, I doubt that Kevin Docherty
would have said that the students could never be
properly represented by her. Open your eyes,

The Ficldhouse Fanatics try to distract a Miami foul shooter last night. Pitt won, 82-52.

By Brian Gallagher
Slajf Writer

In one corner, the Miami Hurricanes —
possessors of the worst excuse for a four-
corners offense. They came into Fitzgerald
Field House losers in eight of their past
nine games. In the other corner, the
Panthers — losers of four in a row, slowly
living up to the expectations of preseason
pundits.

Last night’s nationally televised Big East '

matchup wasn't expected to be a thing of
beauty. And it wasn’t. But at least it got Pitt
a conference win.

‘Forward Chris McNeal scored 20 points '

and first-year forward Chris Gant chipped
in with 12 points off the bench to vault Pitt
past Big East newcomer Miami 82-52 last
night before 6,798 at Fitzgerald Field House.
Miami was led by Jerome ‘Scott, who had
15 points. V 1

The ballgame had all the makings of a
blowout in the first five minutes. Pitt
galloped through the Hurricanes’ zone
defense to a quick 14-3’ lead, shooting
perfectly from the floor for the first five
minutes of the game.

Darren Morningstar (15 points, 8
rebounds) dropped in three deuces from

the paint, and Gandhi Jordan drilled a"

three-pointer at the 15:58 mark. The rout
was seeminglyin order.

Only Miami woke up.’ Either that or Pitt
fell asleep. A

During a rather silly 10-minute span
Miami actually outscored Pitt 18-13. And
when Miami guard Jim Kieserman hit two
free throws with 5:28 left in the half, the
‘Canes climbed to within six, 27-21. But

ff‘ .that’s the closest they got, thanks in large

part to theinspired play of guard Jerry
McCullough.
Upon his entrance Pitt recovered from

’its drunken stupor with a snappy first-half

finish.

crush Hurricanes, 82-52

McCullough’s end—to—end driving layup
at 3:37 in the half made it 32-21. Then it
was McNeal’s turn.

McNeal ended the half on fire, tallying
nine straight points, including a layup at
the buzzer. Pitt took a comfortable halftime
lead, 41-26.

As he has all season, the Panther junior
recovered from a” series of subpar
performances against formidable
opponents such as Arizona (5 points, 7
rebounds) and Georgetown (6 points, 1
rebound)’to rack up monster numbers
against lesser opposition. ' ’ ' ‘

While McNeal seemed pleased with his

efforts, he said there’s Still room for
improvement.‘ ' ‘ '
“I don't think I-’m back in mygame,
where I was at the beginning of the year, ”’
McNeal’ said. “Hopefully, tonight is the

start of something good for me.”

Pitt head coach Paul Evans agreed‘ that
while McNeal’s return to form was
acceptable, his “back-on-track efforts are
needed consistently. I just want to see him
back on track against the UCo_nns and
Georgetowns,” Evans said.

The second half proved even uglier
than the first.

Pitt shot an incredible 28 free throws in

- the second half, making 18 for an almost

respectable 64 percent. .

Miami was relentless in its hacking, due‘
in large part to the slow whistle of officials
Jody Silvester, Joe Mingle and Roger
Parramore. ‘

The trio’s first-half performance, which
included 14 personal fouls called on Pitt,
encouraged ' the ‘Canes’ to play mor
aggressively. , V

At the same time Evans’ persistent
barking seemed to pay off. Miami was
whistled for 18 fouls. ' '

Evans pointed out his team’s defensive
intensity as a key to the blowout win. “Our

Shooting woes continue as Lady Pam‘/aers fall z‘oHo3/as

By Ryan Buncl1er
Senior Sports Writer

After leading 59-34 at the half,
the Pitt women's basketball team
was overrun in the second half in
an 88-77 loss to (ieorgetown last
night.

The loss, which dropped the
Lady Panthers’ record to 7-1 '1
overall, 3-6 in the Big liast, was in
large part due to the lloyas’ (M-
3, 8-1) dominance of backcourt
play during the-night. Pitt’s guards
combined to score 16 points (21-
percent shooting from the floor)
and turned the ball over 22 times.
Their Georgetown counterparts
racked up /11 points (on 59-
percent shooting) and turned the
ball over 14 times.

Kris \X/itfill, a 5—foot, 7-inch
junior who led the lloyas in
scoring entering the contest,
scored 2'5 points to go along with
four steals. I-ler partner in the
starting backcou rt, 5-3 sophomore
Niki Reid, struggled with only
two points and five ‘turnovers.
First-year player .\"adira Ricks,
who has been a solid scorer off
the bench all year for
Georgetown, picked up a bit of
the slack with 15 points.

By contrast, Pitt’s top-scoring
guard, sophomore Erin Maloy,
struggled with only eight points.
She continues to shoot nearly

exclusively from three-point
range ('1 '1 of her '12 attempts on
this night) and just isn’t making
enough of them. Starting point
guard Carol Morton contributed
nine assists but also had nine
turnovers. Top reserve Jill
Mclilhinny was not the solution,
with two points, nine turnovers
and no assists.

The Panthers did get a strong
effort from their front line. Center
Carolyn Miller had a career—high
'19 points to go along with eight
rebounds. She was seven-for-10
from the field and perfect on five
free-throw attempts. Power
forward Jonna Huemrich, Pitt’s
top scorer and rebounder on the
year, chipped in '15 points and 11
rebounds. 'l'wo players who Pitt
hasn’t been getting the usual
contributions from lately, Jill
(Iolabrese and'I'uria Ransom, had
solid performances. Starting small
forward Colabrese seemed to
break out of her recent shooting
slump with 16 points. Ransom, a
starter until an ankle injury
recently hampered her, chipped
in nine points in only 15 minutes.

Center Karen Sheehan, a 6-1
senior, held up the l-loya end in
the frontcourt with game highs in
points (24), blocked shots (five)
and rebounds (12).Junior forward
Leni Wilson hit only three of 13

College bas/eetballs tbe nation ’s most exciting sport

By Matt Silverman
For The Pitt News

Editor’s Note: Each week, a
member of the WPTS sports staff
will author a columrzforThe Pitt
News. WPTS-FM (98.5), the
campus radio station, airs its
“Spo1isjoumal”M0nday tb rough
Friday from 4:30- 5 pm.

Now is the winter of the sports
fan's content. There should be no
distractions. We are engulfed in
the heart of America’s most
eclipsing and exciting sport:
college basketball.

Many of you are likely to argue
this statement. So I will answer as
many of your frivolous excuses
for sports as I can.

To begin, football is over. The
Super Bowl once again proved to
be two weeks of hype and three
hours of John Madden’s “big,
non—fat guys.” _

Anyway, other than watching
Barry Sanders play, football as a
sport is as stale as a Bubby Brister
candy bar that was left on some
shelf in the NFL Films vault.

So you're probably asking,
“What about ice hockey, the
world’s fastest team sport?”

This cannot even be considered
because John Zeigler, NHL
president, is missing several letters
from his alphabet. Namely “T,”
“V” and all the letters that make
up the word “contract.”

There also has got to be a new
rule saying all non—American
players have to have their names

on their
phonetically.
Tennis cannot be considered
because if you are wearing shorts
and there is no shot clock, it’s not
a sport. And golf cannot be
considered a worthy enough sport
because the standings are judged

jerseys spelled

-on how much money the

“athletes” win.

As for professional basketball,
well, for all the reasons it is good
and bad, college hoops is better
and better.

The first reason is coverage.
ESPN is broadcasting 190 Division
I games this year. Add that to the
networks’ coverage, and it’s
probably well over 200 games —
far above the number of NBA
games.

I’m sure you are saying to
yourself, “I like watching the big
schools, but who cares about
Eastern Tennessee State or
Northern Iowa?"

Two things make watching
teams like these interesting and
fun. One is that a lot of great

ballplayers play on these types of
teams.Guys who have pro
potential.Imagine watching
Reggie Lewis playing at
Northeastern or Scottie Pippen at
Central Arkansas during their
college years. There are still plenty
more like them out there.

The other exciting thing about
these small teams is the possibility
of the upset. Sure, when the New
Jersey Nets beat the Utah jazz,
you can call it an upset, but nc
one will remember it a year from
now.

However no one will ever forget
Notre Dame breaking UCLA’s
winning streak in the ’70s or
unheard-of Chaminade beating
highly ranked Virginia in 1982.
Even Duke surprising UNLV last
year is memorable. It’s a cliche,
but everyone loves underdogs
and college basketball is full of
them.

Defense. Defense. Defense. It’s
easy to say that you like to see
scoring and 360-degree dunks.

There is nothing wrong with

this. But it’s more exciting to
watch a team like Indiana
(Hoosiers, not Pacers) spread its
defense out and deny any sort of
offensive penetration by a
nationally ranked team that is
constantly swinging the ball
around the court, probing for a
weakness.

Almost every NBA player can
dunk. Almost every NBA player
can hit an open jumper, and it’s
great to watch these fine athletes
play.But it gets repetitious and
boring. Year in and year out we
watch the same players in all the
same situations.

College basketball presents so
many different confrontations and
opuons

Players are only around for

four years. They have no multi-

year contracts or Bugs Bunny
commercials. College athletes are
playing for their schools and their
teams.

Pro athletes are playing for A

themselves.

Every year in college basketball
brings us surprises, upsets,
emotional last games for seniors,
cross—country matchups, state
rivalries, etc. This is where the
excitement of following sports
lies.

Now is the perfect time for the S

true sports fan because we are
into conference play, the very
heart of the season.

All you have to do is tune- in
every night and you can catch a
great matchup and some great
ballplayers.

It’s also important to watch
these games so you can prepare
yourself for March Madness and
the NCAA Tournament, which is
the single greatest and most
exciting collection of sporting
events on the face of the Earth.

At least until opening day of
baseball season.

shots on the way to nine points but did grab nine
boards. Senior forward Tricia Corace matched
Wilson on the boards and contributed 11 points.

The Hoyas, who don't count on any one or
two players to score, could afford the weak
performances by Reid and Wilson in a way that
Pitt couldn’t overcome Maloy’s weak shooting
night. lfMaloy or l»-luemrich don’t score, the Pitt
offense struggles.

Georgetown’s offense is keyed by turnovers
forced by an aggressive pressing game. They
force an average of 24 per game, and they

generated 31 from the Lady Panthers.

The Hoya style is meant to disrupt the
opponent’s game — not let them get it back
together. That can lead to periods like the
second half last night, in which the Hoyas
outscored the Lady Panthers 54-38.

The loss is the third in a row for the Lady
Panthers. Things won’t get any easier any time
soon, as Pitt hosts Providence (12-5, 5-3) Saturday.
The Lady Friars ran over the Lady Panthers in a
109-90 win earlier this season. Pitt couldn’t keep
up with the fast-paced, high-scoring game of the
Lady Friars, who average 95.6 points per game.

Wrestlers host Bloomsburg
in league dual-meet action

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Sports Writer

After five straight weekends on
the road, the Panther wrestling
team returns home to face
conference rival Bloomsburg
University this Saturday at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt’s dual—meet record is 4-4,
including a win over seventh-
ranked Ohio State. All four losses
have come at the hands of T op 25
opponents; the most recent was a
26-15 setback at third-ranked
Penn State on Sunday. The
Panthers’ EWL dual—meet season
will heat up over the next three
weeks. Pitt is 1-2 in conference
and will face EWL foes Edinboro,
Clarion and West Virginia in
addition to Bloomsburg.

The Huskies are 3-2-1 with wins
over Indiana, Drexel and Navy.
Their setbacks came at the hands
of Minnesota and Clarion, with a
tie against North Carolina at the

/Virginia Duals. _
Before the clash with Pitt,

Bloomsburg will travel to West
Virginia for a Friday night battle.
Bloomsburg’s lineup features a
first-year wrestler, three redshirt
freshmen and four sophomores.
Head coach Roger Sanders said
he expects a fierce test from the
Panthers.

“We’re a very young group, and
we’re just trying to get better every
week,” Sanders said. “Hopefully

we can turn the corner this
weekend. This is a very big
weekend for us; if we can win
one of these two matches. But Pitt
has a lot more balance than we
do.”

The big guns for the Huskies
have been Tim Casey (126
pounds), Brad Rozanski (134) and
Andy Fitzpatrick (150). Casey, a
junior from Wilkes Barre, Pa., is
14-4-1 following last weekend’s
PSAC Championships, in which
he took four straight matches and
the title. Casey finished third in
the 118-pound class at last year’s
EWL tournament and holds a

‘career EWL record of 9-4-1.

Fitzpatrick, a sophomore from
Aurora, Colo., also won his weight
class at the PSACS.

Sanders expressed concern
about facing four Panthers in
particular: Bobby Simpson (118),

Scott Hovan (158), Jeff Kloiber.

(190) and Perry Miller
(Heavyweight). He said the
remainder. of the 10 bouts will be
the big key.

“Those four guys are going to
beat us,” he said. “If we don’t win
the other six, we’re in trouble.”

Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemyer said his team and
Bloomsburg match up dead even
on paper.

“It should be an interesting
match,” Stottlemyer said. ‘‘It could
be a 5-5 split, or it could go5-4-1

or 4-5-1. Anytime you have an A

EWL match, records go out the
window.”

Stottlemyer said he feels that
Bloomsburg has a substantial
edge in the early weight classes.
He said Pitt needs to keep the
match close entering the final two
bouts in order to have a solid
chance.

The 118-pound bout between
Simpson and Peter Rinella should
be a tight contest. Simpson is still
showing the effects of a late start,
but he appears to be regaining his
form. Casey and Rozanski give
the Huskies the edge at 126 and
154, but the 142-pound bout
should be another hotly contested
matchup.

Stottlemyer said Steve Budman
should be able to wrestle Saturday.
Budman missed the Penn State
meet due to an inner—ear infection
but should be ready to battle
sophomore Stephen Lilley. Lilley
defeated Budman at last year’s
EWL Tournament to qualify for
nationals.

Panther first—year man Joe
Plouse has come on strong in
recent weeks and could provide a
challenge to Fitzpatrick at 150.
Pitt’s strengths come into effect
with Hovan and Sean Gibbs (167).

“If we’re within six points or
even eight points going into 190,
we'll be in good shape,”
Stottlemyer said. “We have the
capacity to get some big points
once we get to 90.” V

CSEA member Paul Amato said,
“We got discouraged that people
who think like we do didn’t say
anything.”

Amato insisted the group is not
anti-homosexual. “We are not
neo-Nazi or anything like that.
We are just regular guys who are
a bit to the right on particular
issues.” I

If the military were to change
its policy banning gays, lesbians
and bisexuals, he would “support
that policy and follow it to the
letter,” Amato "said. J.

Biancheria said elected
representatives of the law—school
student body voted for the ban,
and the issue is none of I-‘isher’s
business. —

“He should be worried about
the deplorable unemployment
instead of working to further the
oppression of minorities,"
Biancheria said.

Hollywood, the land ofdreams

good is measured by its blatant
mediocrity, a magical land full of
makeup artists and poorly made

can be said to be equal to the

failure as it turns out the same

Cinema group, better known for
its commitment to sequels (House

to Firestarter, only this time

This diddy premiered at the fabled

“This film may bring in teen—bopper

notice as “The Choice Is You rs” is

Future nostalgia revisted

Helios Creed
Lactating Purple
Amphetamine Reptile Records

After two solid samples of the
installment of the
International, an exhibition that
is considered by many to be the
concise compilation of the world's
best artistic statements of the past
four years, I arrived at one
conclusion: America pines
desperately for a rose—colored
vision of our current disposition,
which is tiredly referred to as

post-modern.

Yeah, sure. The International
was provoking: Paint machines
shaking to Brother James, big,
tall Franco-metropolitan squalor
and 19305 Stalinistic Soviet
capsules of towns like
Magnitorgorst, a Siberian
industrial center which is
surrounded by the richest iron-
ore deposits in the world. (You
can bet your booty that without it
today we would be surrounded
by the Teutonic hordes.)

No, I’m not trying to stomp on

UWVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

this stuff, nor am I attempting to
review it. I'm just trying to make
a contrast. One can look
nostalgically backward and be
remiss to the present day and not
even consider how this industrial
phenomenon will penetrate our
collective psyche. A partial elixir
to this disturbing trend is to grab
an earful of the latest Helios Creed
— Lactating Purple. Hey, it's
better than chummin’ with the
crew of your choice on a nasty
Jan. eve to the latest disco
compilation designed to make
you believe a decade that pur-
posely had no purpose, had one.

Like the crock-pot method of
steel making, Helios Creed
resembles the two-pronged, 20-
foot electrodes that zap a bi-
zillion watts into the 80-foot crock
of one part iron ore/one part
coked coal; this latest record
propels you into the molten, 500-
degree kelvin soup. This second

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 30, 1992

full-length on Amphetamine
Reptile wields an entropic, multi-
layered assault on the senses.
Like Max Katie's release from
the joint, this record’s aural
qualities jump from the vinyl
and leave an indelible mark
upon your cerebellum.

Take the cut “Amenti”: Images
of a burned and bombed 1944
Dresden’s 16th-century cathe-
drals —some totally pummeled,
others half standing —~ quickly
come to mind. Or try “Martin
Sperm Bagpipes,” which
muddles along like a 400- pound
catfish groundfeeding upon
Detroit bilge in Lake Michigan.
For something safer, try the
psychotropic, Ph lollipop safari
of “Modular Green.” lfyou liked
the previous 7-inch release,
“Your Spaceman,” you’ll be
pleased as punch with this one.

Returning to the visual, with
deference to the Unsane’s latest

record and Pussy Ga1ore’s Dial I

M., the cover is top-ﬂight. Here’s
the recipe: One .44 service

handgun, one ’62 tail-ﬁnned Avanti
driven by a Lynchian eye and
mouth and three colossal blast
furnace cylinders, all of which is
juxtaposed with a full frontal of a
bare, self-manipulated female
bosom. By my lights, this would be
stage center if I could conduct an

exhibition
Like their San Franciscan
neighbors The Royal Trux, Helios
Creed and cast (Paul Kirk on bass,
Paul Della Pelle on drums and Z
Sylver on samples) are on to
something. It’s similar to what Cop
Shoot Cop _is doing on the East
Coast and what Flour and thejesus
Lizard are doing in Chicago and
similar to what Chrome was doing
15 years ago. Some are attempting
the armchair method to our 1992
industrial inheritance. Helios Creed
and its label Amphetamine Reptile
try brass tacks, exposing the
unmitigated power of industry and
its frightening, grim consequences.
Ed. Note.- Helios Creed is a node

‘n’ roll band.

Milano. All this and an urban
drama about Hollywood's
homeless teenagers. This all goes
back to the dream thing at the
start of the article. You gotta love
the gritty street themes, especially
with this cast, and that word is
born.

The now omnipresent Kevin
Costner syndrome of Indians is
back with New Line and 20th
Century Fox jumping on the

’wagon trail. Lou Diamond

Phillips, “Mr. Ethnicity,” stars in
The Darle Wind about a Hopi
Indian and a Navajo who get
mixed up in witchcraft, murder
and revenge.

Fred Ward, who was supposed
to be the next “Bond; James Bond”
as Remo Williams also stars, albeit
a bad choice of word in Errol
Morris’ (The Thin Blue Line, which
was excellent) newest film. The
Fox trotters bring us what we
really need, though: a cinematic
adaptation of the James
Fennimore Cooper novel Thelast
Of The Mohicans‘. Starring

talented Daniel Day Lewis and
directed by Michael Mann, this
one is sure to make us ask, “What
ever happened to the cowboys?”

Also from 20th Century comes
the dreaded romantic—comedy
plot starring pretty boy Alec
Baldwin and Meg Ryan in “an
enchanting fable about the
immortality of true love.” The
only reason it’s immortal is
because ﬁlm executives think it
brings in money, money, money,
money. (Sing it with soul, now.)
We look forward to this like
intestinal flu and a swig of Riopan.

By Christmas, Fox should be
the rage with the release of Home
Alone ll, which, oh, by the way,
is the sequel to the third-highest
grossing ﬁlm of all time and the
highest~grossing comedy ever!
Poor Macaulay Culkin is only
getting $3 mil for this one, and
he’s underpaid! This time he gets
lost in New York and has to fend
for himself. You know what? We’ll

money.” The American dream
indeed: Get paid a lot of money
to act like a dumb ass and get
outsmarted by an 11-year-old.

Well, if this one doesn’t turn
green, Danny DeVito’s Hoffa
should be the hype of the
Christmas season. The press
release just says, “The rise and
fall of America’s foremost labor
champion.” All you need to know
is thatJack “Go Lakers” Nicholson
is the star. Hoffa never looked
worse.

One of the more immediate
releases comes from the
rejuvenated Disney/Touchstone/
Hollywood pictures conglo-
merate, which has returned to
the upper echelon of Hollywood
once again, thanks to the
animation rave. Medicine Man
stars our generation’s Cary Grant,
Sean Connery, as a radical doctor
who has a major medical
breakthrough interrupted by
Lorraine Bracco, i.e. “that damn
journalist.” Of course they fall in
love “amid the exotic ﬂora and
fauna of the sultry jungle.” Sounds
like one to sweat with.

More pathetic endeavors from
these moguls include Straight Talk
starring Dolly Parton as a small-
town dance instructor who leaves
for Chicago and becomes a
famous radio hostess. She falls in
love with James “I think I’ll go
hide in the” Woods. He should
be ashamed of himself, but the
idea of Dolly as a dance instructor
has some bounce. Then there is
Robert Duvall starring in Newsies,
a freaking musical about
newspaper millionaires of the
early 1900s.

This one has the potential to be
the season’s worst. As for Duvall,
it could be Apocalypse Now for
him. .

One flick that has some
potential is Blame It On The
Bellboy, which stars Dudley
Moore but also Bronson Pinchot
as the bellboy who mixes things
up at a hotel in Venice. It sounds
like it has the makings of an
Inspector Clouseau deal, but
Pinchot in that role is a grim
thought and one that almost
seems like he would be the perfect
stranger for that role.

T here’s more. Honey. [Blew Up
The Kids. This time Rick Moranis
zaps his kid with an enlarging
machine and the infant grows to
112 feet only to be chased into
the desert. Honey, I just blew up
Hollywood. Then there’s Whoopi
Goldberg and Harvey Keitel
(Why’d you do it, Harvey?) in
SisterAct, in which Whoopi winds
up in an orthodox convent of
nuns, where we hope she stays.

Things aren't so bad, though.
Alien3 is due soon. Ripley arrives
on an orbiting prison space station
to battle guess who (er, what).
Alien and Aliens remain the

quintessential sci—ﬁ films of our»
generation. Night And The City.

looks like a winner with Robert
De Niro andJessica lange teaming
up as connivers out to make a
buck in the world of boxing.
Maybe it’s a white man_’s Uptown
Saturday Night. Regardless, it’s
De Niro at his seedy,
downtrodden scumbag best, not
in some hokey role like in
Awakenings, where he played
some type of trauma casualty.

baseheads and their endeavors)
definitely keeps ya head bobbin’
and ya system thumpin’. “Up In
The Mountains” is a trip through
lockup, with ya path paved by a
fat track.

“Up in The Mountains” is the
second release off the album,
and you can catch it on M'lV but
rarely on the radio. The first
release was “Across ’l'he 110.”
Definitely MMG’s national
anthem.

Uptown’s in the house on this
one. Harlem! Marrs kicks the
warning signs in an odd, old—
school fashion on top ofblowin’
up a jeep beat that has that old-
school, rough-beat feel.

The second side takes a while
to get started but does. “The ice
Man Cometh” grows on ya about

the second or third listen, but “2
Black 2 Strong” hits ya the first
time around. This one is funky,
although the flow is interrupted
by some high pitched, no-style
mike. Marrs manages to keep it
tolerable.

One of my favorites, “War On
Drugs,” tells the truth about the
justice, ‘cause the war on drugs is
a war on just us. Think about it:
Scarface sittin’ up in the White
House.

“Going All Out” is, no doubt, a
song to stay away from. Pure
boodee. The guest MCs have no
skills at all. Irritation.

“Burn Baby Burn” ends the
album with UMPH.

Marrs discusses how he feels
about the US. flag. (Listen to the
title.)

Another one of my favorites.

This is an album worth
induction into the collection for
the true at heart, but to the Heavy
I) and Big Daddy Kane lovers:
Steer kleer. Ya Can’t Kick It.

Like my man Chill would say,
“But Anyway.” PEN TO THE
POCKl"I'l'.

Light Sleeperis right up our alley
with its blatant portrayal of evil
and heroin and life on the fringe.
Starring Susan Sarandon and
Willem Dafoe, it was written and
directed by (American Gigolo,-
writing credits for Taxi Driver
and Raging Bull) Paul Schrader.
It’s due in March, although it
opened to great praise at the
Sundance Festival. In April,
director Bill Duke brings us Deep
Cover starring Larry Fishburne
and}effGoldblum. This one looks
interesting with Furious playing
an undercover narcotics officer
who becomes caught up in the
drug scene. Let’s hope it doesn’t
turn into a good cop/ bad cop,
good vs. evil, Hollywood Utopian
mush plot.

More important, though, is the

Top ten Diamond
out tha house,
heading to the
' thicket.

“He harbors in
his heart a deep

furrow from
which good
councils grow.”
Peace is not the
word to play Paul,

long—awaited “Twin Peaks” ﬁlm
entitled Fire Walla With Me. David
Lynch (mob) writes and directs
this retro look back to the events
leading up to Laura Palmer’s
death.

All your “Peaks” favorites plus
David Bowie and Harry Dean
Stanton. Mission accomplished.
Don’t start x-ing the calendar,
though. It ain’t arriving til
September.

Rap and rock stars collide in
Roadside Prophets starring John
Doe, Adam Horovitz and John
Cusack with cameos from Kung-
Fu David Carridine, Timothy Leary
and Arlo Guthrie. Abbe Wool’s
motorcycle quest takes Doe and
Horovitz across the American
southwest, where they come
across visionaries, freaks and
philosophers.

Cusack’s restaurant manners
have already been labeled a
classic scene.
~ Jimjarmusch is back with Night
On Earth, which he describes as
“a sequence of five comedies
which occur simultaneously but
which span different time zones,
continents and languages.” Let’s
hope that Pittsburgh gets this in
the next five years. '

Remember: There is strength
in unity. So let’s all join as one
and demand that Naleed Lunch,
David Cronenberg’s cinematic
jaunt into Billy Burrough’s bizarre
world, be released in Pittsburgh.
Half the world has seen it, but it
looks like we won’t until the
leaves turn colors again.

Reservoir Dogs looks great.
Starring Harvey Keitel and
directed by Quienten Tarantino,

this one got major props at
Sundance with its raw, violent
and stylish focus. Old habits die
hard, so Christopher Munch is set
to unload his 60-minute
speculation of what a weekend
in the country would be like
between Brian Epstein and John
Lennon. That’s all we know, but
the ‘Burgh might never see this
one. Better travel.

The big winner at Sundance
was In The Soap, which took top
honors in film and actor.
Alexander Rockwell’s story of a
roughish and fascinatingly
charming con artist/would—be film
financier won Seymour Cassell
acting honors for his hysterical
portrayal. Shadows And Fog is
Woody Allen’s latest black-and-
white voyage, and what a cast
he’s brought along forthis 1920s

comedy! Mia Farrow, Madonna,
Cusack, Jodie Foster, John
Malkovich, Lily Tomlin and Kathy
Bates arrive to prove Woody’s
got a lot more pull than those
hulking biceps would allow us to
beheve.

And finally, although this list is
grossly incomplete and half of

these movies (except the ones,

we said were bad) will get

‘ scrapped and prove Hollywood

really to be Hollow Wood, Wim
Wenders goes everywhere in the
world and brings together actors
and actresses from anywhere in
his hip new film, Until 7heEnd Of
The World. Some will say the
soundtrack is cool, but Elvis
Costello, U2, REM. and Lou Reed
haven’t written a good song
among ‘em in 10 years, so we’ll
stick to the juice crew.

D} Ax, liric li. Vill and Prince

Jay and Curios Jorge. The jam is
new—school with an old-school
feel with classic background
crowd noises and a pass—the~
mike flavor. liusta Rhymes and
Charlie Brown ofI.eaders Of'l'he
New School team up to make
noise on the reggae-infected “Rub
Off ’l'lia Wax,” while Large
Professor lends his unique voice
and production skills on “Gots Ta
Get This.”

This track reeks of Main Source
flavor, with a lot of drum under
the vocals, and jacks the old
Steve Miller "Fly Like An Eagle
intro.” El Fishbone adds an

additional verse to the cut, proving
that Powerule is down. Other
cuts to bounce to include “Que.
Pasa? (What’s Going On?),” with
its funky organ and bouncin’ drum‘

track, and of course a sampled
horn from Marvin Gaye’s classic
street anthem “What’s Going On.”
The whole wax don’t work,
though, as Powerule throws in
some mellow, soulful beats that
kinda chug instead of grind, and
the repetitive chorus throughout
the record doesn’t cut it.
Sometimes it gets played out,
while at other times the beats are
too big and mechanical-sounding.

In a year full ofslammin’ debut
records, Powerule doesn’t come
out on any retro lists, but the
band deserves props. Back from
the depths of underground, one-
hit wonders, Powerule proves it
is for real.

A definite for all y’all hardcore
hip-hop junkies.

4. Pete Rock and CL Smooth AllSou1ed Out EP Elektra. Thanks
to Pete for bringing back the scratch and thanks to CL for his
dope rhymes.

Other Props: Main Source, Brand Nubians, Gang Starr, UMCS, De
La, Del, Powerrule,-Naughty By Nature and everyone else who
y’all pump but I forgot.

Boy, get out tha past. It’s time to look to the future, and what
could be more promising than a new UltraMagnetic MCs tape.
Yo, it seems like forever since the Bronx bombers first burst and
dropped crazy beats. The first single “Make It Happen” is the
baddest jam out and proves Kool Keith and Ced Gee are it. It’s
due out within the next two weeks and bound to explode. Lord
Finesse is also back with his newest The Return Of The Fun/ey
Man on Giantrecords as the “Funky Technician” moves to a
semi—big label. Produced by Finesse, Showbiz, Diamond D. and
Alladin, Finesse proves himself as a true lyricist once again with
roughneck yet suave style. Spend your duckets now. Boogie
Down is back, too, with the first single off the upcoming album
Sex/ind Violence, due out February 26. Kris keeps evolving by
dropping a funky loop on “Duck Down” and a tribute to the old
school on “We In There.” As usual, BDP in tha house!

Also, from Chrysalis comes the major label debut ofAndre the
Giant and Showbiz who get much props in this book. Hangin’
around the underground ofFinesse and Gang Starr fer years, Dre
gets a chance to show America his funky, funky flow and
Showbiz his delicate production techniques. Gang Starr is back
as well with its second effort on Chrysalis due in March which
should be phat, no doubt. But what might be the most awaited
record could be the Kool G. Rap and DJ Polo wax produced by
none other than Jinx, Cube, and Chilly Chill. Kool G.’s rhymes
have always been in there; match that with the Lenchmob and
it’s time to break ‘em off some’n. Oh, man. Rumors, rumors: by
now ya know Third Bass called it quits with Pete and Richie Rich
holding onto the name and Serch heading his own way,
apparently with DJ Muggs. Supposedly they’ve already cut some
tracks and something should be comin’ out soon. Also Ice Cube’s

screenplay entitled “America Eats Its Young” has been picked up .

by a major distributor. No. word. yet. as to who .will.star_but.
tentative release date is next summer. Lay-tour!
