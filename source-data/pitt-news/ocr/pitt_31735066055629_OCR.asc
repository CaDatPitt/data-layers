Down but not out

SGB, CWO lobby
for slucleni aid

By Cesar Antoneili
NewsAssistant 1

Six Student Government Board
members and three Campus
Women’s Organization members
recently attended a ‘weekend con-
vention and rally in Washington to
save student aid
. The SGB is a member of the
United States Student Amociation,
a national student organization
which hosted the conference and is
dedicated to protecting student aid,
defending affirmative action and
battling anti-irnmigration laws. '

“Every day, senators just hear
numbers and numbers,” Brian
Heffron, SGB’s Governmental
Relations Committee chair, said
“By us going down‘ there as stu-
dents, not lobbyists, we made a
difference. When you can bring
students down, and you can bring
their stories down, you have a
powerful weapon. We have at great
resource as students.”

Members got to hear a speech
by Sen. Jim Jeffards (R—Vt.) and
speak with Pennsylvania Senators
Arlen Specter and Rick Santomm
and Rep. Cohen. They also attend-
ed a press conference given by
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).

“The Senate is overwhelmingly,
resoundingly pro-student, especial-
ly Specter, Jeffards and [Paul]
Simon (D-]ll.),” Heﬁron said

Education is 1.8 percent of the

federal budget as it stands now.
602B Funds, chunks of money
allocated to each state to better
education, are the primary way the
federal government funds state
education. USSA is fighting to
keep 602Bs large because the
more funds given to each state, the
less ﬁghting within a state over
how much of that money goes to
public primary schools and how
much to higher education.

“Being involved in a national
organization like this helps fulﬁll

our duty as a student government '

board,” SGB President Andy
Wuertele said. '

In addition to trying to maintain
current levels of funding for state
education, USSA is battling to
stop cuts to federal student aid pro-
grams proposed by Congress.

“The House has a tendency to
zero out a lot of spending initia-
tives, like Stafford Loans, Perkins
Loans and State System
Incentives,” Heﬂion said

Perkins Loans and State System
Incentives were saved through the
Specter-Harkin Amendment on
March 12. In addition to these pro-
grams, $10.l billion was restored
to education in early Febmary.

“Student aid is a number one
priority,” Keith Campbell, SGB’s
legislative director, said. “With the
help of schools and state student
organizations, we’re well on our

With only his hand tapping
his thigh to keep the beat, Si
Kahn sang about the Holocaust,
slavery and women’s rights as
part of his “song-speech” and
lecture on social change enti-
tled “Baniers to Bridges.”

The 30-year veteran of com-
munity organizing, author of
“How People Get Power,” and
songwriter spoke at the Frick
Fine Arts Auditorium Saturday.
The School of Social Work
invited Kahn in celebration of
National Social Work Month.
The lecture was part of their
continuing education program
and supported the Community
Organizing Scholarship Fund,
which gave a total of $13,000
in scholarships last year.

Kahn, a native of State
College, Pa., returning home
after 36 years, used his unique
“song-speech” to talk about the
ways that race, gender and class
can become bridges to unite us,
rather than barriers that divide
us.
One of his songs told how
wars are not fought only in far
off lands or stuck in the history
books. Now in our own country

Speaker promotes
awareness through
speech and song

there are battles being fought,
like the war against women.
“Take to the streets, lift up
your voice, fight for your life
while you still have a choice,”
he sang in a song about abor-

tion rights. “Tell ‘em this is

nobody’s body but mine,” the
chorus rang on.

Kahn said he began incorpo-
rating song into his lectures
about 15 years agorbecause
he’s less nervous when singing
than when speaking. Only in
the last four or five years, how-
ever, has he perfected his
“song-speech” form, one that
he said he’s never seen dupli-
cated.

Kahn said the combination of
text and song helps him to open
his audience to new ideas.

“I feel like the songs move,
you into a different space.”
Kahn said. “It’s a way to get
people to engage themselves
emotionally. I want to break
down defenses.”

Kahn began the evening with
a song about the children of the
Holocaust. He then recounted
his trip three years ago to Nazi
concentration camps and the
home of Anne Frank. He talked
about the resistance movements

WASHINGTON — After 18

way to bargaining back every
penny of student aid No other pro-
gram has received such support,
not Medicare, not Social Security.

‘The cuts in funding to this uni-
versity affect the quality of educa-
tion we receive, not just the cost of
tuition,” Campbell continued.
“This university does a lot with
increasingly little.” Campbell sees
funding cuts as hurting individual
departments, computer and infor-
mation services, and hiring proce-
(hires.

Gov. Ridge has defended his
university funding cuts by saying
that he wants universities to make
management decisions, “like pri-
vate sector has to make everyday.”

“We sent the Governmental
Relations Committee and. the

a total of nine people,” Campbell
said. “Those nine people came
back after learning more about the
issue and how policy decisions are
made. They came back very

Their goal is to build a network

The SGB is trying to a get a ref-

November for a $1-per-year fee for
students to fund a state student
organization. Schools in several
states have the fee already.

The committee also returned
with some big goals for coalition
building in the Oakland communi-
ty to lobby to state and city ofﬁ-
cials for changes in the area, like
the proposed test closing of
Bigelow Boulevard.

“If we want that, we really have

Campbell would like to see a

Campbell cites that interest on a

a tax deduction, but interest paid

-From page 1
by the people of Amsterdam dur-
ing the Nazi occupation of their
country.

He told of how radios were
declared illegal during the Nazi
occupation. The penalty for pos-
session of one was death. On his
trip he heard stories of how peo-
ple would hide their radios in
ditches and bring them out at
night. Such acts of resistance
forced many into hiding.

Kahn said their resistance
should be a lesson to us.

“The most civil act is to be dis-
obedient,” Kahn said.

He suggests habits of resis-
tance as the only way to fight
against what he calls the fascist
attitudes in our own country;
These attitudes produce the
hatred directed against people of
color, women, homosexuals‘ and
bisexuals, Jews and the poor, all
who have had to learn these
habits of resistance for mere sur-
vival.

“We must refuse to cooperate
with injustice,” Kahn said.

He suggested we start by
developing an ability to recog-
nize evil and take action against
it, and also to refuse to make a
choice that will result in an injus-
tice.

We must stand together and for
one another, Kahn said. When a
man hears a. woman being sexu-
ally harassed, he should speak
against it. When white people
hear derogatory remarks about
African Americans, they should
not tolerate it.’

Such resistance is not easy,
Kahn said. It may require speak-
ing against a friend, family mem-
ber, co-worker or employer. It
may even be in defense of some-
one you do not like. But in order
to bridge the gaps in our society,
we must learn to practice these
habits of resistance each day
with completeness.

“This quiet power gives us
hope for the future,” Kahn said.
“In a world that is wracked by
hatred and violence, such habits

of resistance are all we have to

begin.”

Opinions
Thanks for the help

Pitt students, we are once again stunned by your apathy. This
Saturday there will be a concert held to beneﬁt Kevin Cecil, one of
our former peers. He was a student, that is, until someone shot him in
the back of the neck and made him a quadriplegic. He sat next to
some of you in classes, ate in the same cafeteria as you, maybe even
lived in the same apartment building as some of you. Yet very few of

you bought a ticket to attend the concert. V
' This benefit is not going to be a boring dinner filled with long I

speeches and lectures (sorry to ruin a possible excuse for not going);
it’s a concert Local bands, much like at the Rally Against Violence,
are performing at the beneﬁt to help Kevin Cecil. You would proba-
bly pay a cover charge to see them at a bar, so why not see the same
bands and give your money (tickets only cost $10) to a good cause?

Kevin Cecil is not a corporate charity serving faceless masses; that
excuse won’t work this time either. Kevin is a guy who was doing a
friend a favor by walking her home after dark, and now he needs
some friends to do him a favor. Even if you never heard of Kevin
Cecil before he was shot, you could easily have been in his place. If
you were, wouldn’t you want to know that the people you went to
school with were willing to help you?

Chemical arsenal mounts

According to the CIA, only the largest nuclear explosion could
destroy the chemical weapons plant that Libya is currently building
inside a mountain. Also according to the CIA, the facility will be the
“world’s largest ‘underground chemical weapons plant” (Pittsburgh
Tribune Review, March 25.) And ﬁnally, no one can stop the plant
from being built.’

The main question is this — why the hell notl? Libya, a known
enemy of the United States under the control of a known terrorist dic-
tator, is allowed to build a chemical weapons plant? The United
States is one of the few remaining superpowers, yet one of its ene-
mies is currently building the technology to destroy this country. And
there is no reason this should be allowed to happen.

The United States has met other countries in conﬂicts over lesser

causes. But now we seem to be willing to give Libya enough time to
create the weapons to kill every United States citizen. Chemical war-
fare is more tragic than any other combat, since the effects of many
weapons are unknown, long-lasting, and indiscriminate in who they
effect Entire populations of towns could be easily mowed down in a
few minutes, or over years.

The United States can not afford the risk of allowing Libya to cre-
ate a chemical arsenal. If nothing else was learned from past military
conﬂicts, we should at least recognize the potential for American sol-
diers to be tortured even after the war is over and they return home.

OK, I can’t blow off my
columns anymore. Ifl see one
more International Socialist
Organization Poster or Kathy Jo
Kramer article I’m going to
scream. '

I have to write because what is
fueling these angry "demands is
unfounded, though I think it isn’t
clear to many people why. I had
this fact reminded to me a month
ago at a Libertarian party meet-
mg.

A Democratic columnist was
there discussing issues with us (a
little more than I think he really
wanted to), and one Libertarian,
Andy Tepper, made the following
observation:

He said that government
should not just get out of the
economy for economic reasons.
As far as he is concerned, if he
sees some quadriplegic starving
naked outside in a sub-zero bliz-
zard, he should not be compelled
to help through any governmental
program. I think a better example
will suﬂice: a 15 year-old girl car-
rying her sick, newborn baby,
begging for people to help her
feed him. Andy would most like-
ly respond that he should not be
forced to support them either.

Well, he is right. However,
such a statement may not win us
a lot of friends unless it is
explained. Why exactly, you
would ask, why would you want
to live in a world .that legalized
such cmelty? My answer is this:
although. such actions should
rightly be legal, it is not cruel and,"
in fact, it is far more cruel to force
someone to support that man than
to let them choose to or not

Hmmm  I sense you aren’t
buying this. Well, I still have

3511 characters left, so let me .

explain.

The psychology that drives the
“share the wealth” belief is that
there is money right now in per-
son A’s hands that would be bet-
ter used in person B’s hands: “For
the price of that mink coat I could
have sent my children to college.”
This is true. But if it is, then my
friend, you are just as guilty as the
rich people you despise. Don’t

Let me ask you: how’s that
new CD you just bought? Or did
you enjoy that movie you saw at
the Beehive? Or how was your
Spring Break in Florida? I hope
you enjoyed them, because the
money you spent on these “luxu-
ries” could have been spent feed-
ing someone more needy than
you. If you’re not living at the
same level of the ‘most destitute
person, you are hypocritical to
complain.

Are these extreme examples?
Maybe, but where do you draw
the line? At what point do you
say that what you want is too

extravagant? Where we tend to .

do so is at other people’s posses-
sions. But most of you want to
succeed, so how will you like it
when someone tells you that

you ’re rich enough?

“But that’s what taxes are for!”
you cry. OK, then answer me
this: Suppose that I gave you
back all of the money that you
paid in taxes, ever. Would you
run out and give it back to all of
the organizations and individuals
that would have otherwise had it?

Let’s take it a step further.
Suppose you did decide, after I
gave youyour tax dollars back,
that you were going to be philan-
thropic about it. Would‘ you give
to all of the same people who
would have gotten your money?
Would you continue to subsidize
struggling small businesses, like
Amtrak?

Even if you stayed away from
corporate welfare, then we have
to bring up the cheats again. That
roommate of yours who collects

disability despite that fact there is

nothing wrong with him outside
of a shredded set‘ of morals. In the
current system he’s got your
money. Now you’ve got it back,
and he wants some. How much
will he get from you?

You may think that this is just a
question of screening, that even
though it will never be perfect,
certainly there are some people
who are undeniably deserving‘.
Like that 15 year-old girl that I
mentioned. Of course, what I
didn’t mention above is that
I didn’t inventher. She’s a real
person who borrowed other peo-
ple’s children, and faked crying in
public so that she could get
money for cigarettes and vodka.
She said it was a great way to get
sympathy.

Let’s even take away the cheats
and assume that this person
would normally have been a valid
recipient of assistance. But he is
also a totally reprehensible
human being. Just think about the
person you despise most, and
imagine him destitute. Don’t you
feel sorry for him that he’s unem-
ployed? Don’t you want to make
sure he has a comfortable life?
And there lies proof of the effi-
ciency of decentralization: no
agency could possibly make these
value judgments with your dollar
better than you, even and espe-
cially if you are attempting to
spend unselﬁshly.

There are people that I want to
help as much as possible. There

are groups that I believe in that I i

would like to give to. There are
also people, places and things that
I want nothing to do with. This
goes the same for you. And right
now, there are dollars of yours
going to people, groups and com-
panies that you don’t want to
help, while deserving people that
you may want to help have to
wait.

So I pose the question: which is
more cruel? -

Eight-step
guide to
tournament
success

    

Columnist
Kevin
Lilley

t’s here.

After almost a month of

tournament quadruple-
headers, the Final Four is
upon us. And as we anxious-
ly await the weekend specta-
cle, we take this opportunity
to look down at our pool
sheets and ponder one sim-
ple question:

“What on earth was I
thinking!?!”
Don’t deny it. If anyone

' can honestly say that they

had Syracuse and
Mississippi State penciled
into the finals, I suggest
hopping the next flight to
Vegas before your luck runs
out or some angry UConn
fan ‘beats you senseless.

We all went through it‘;
That first—round upset that
took out your pet “sleeper”
team that was supposed to ’
make the elite eight. The '
second-round match where
your surprise finalist gets
waxed by fifteen points. And
that last second buzzer-beat-
er that takesiout both your
bracket winner and your
bracket. Everyone’s been
there.

Well, welcome to post-
pool group therapy. As we
all pledge to pay closer
attention to Dick Vitale next I
season, this is a good time to
review our mistakes, and
promise each other that next
season we’ll find the sleep-
ers, pick the upsets, and
clean out the office pool
faster than Kerry Kittles can
clean out a phone card bal-
ance. '

Let’s review our vows:

Next year, we promise not
to buy into media hype.
Princeton might be good for
an opening-round upset, but

_in the end, they are still an

old-fashioned squad with no
star players and a weak con-
ference. Bobby Knight is not
a tournament wizard, Duke
does not always make the
final four, and-never, under
any circumstances, will we
pick a team because of its
coach’s acting ability in taco
or deodorant commercials.

Freshman Melucci gt down and dirty

By Armando Roggio

For The Pitt News

Freshman Lou Melucci’s

'white uniform wore streaks of

mud even before ‘last Sunday’s
home baseball game against
Davis & Elkins began. Melucci
had been smiling, diving for
balls and~rough—housing with
his teammates.

But when his team took the
field, he wore serious intensity.
He was both enjoying the game
and serious about winning.

“At this level, winning is
important, but also going out
and giving it a. 100 percent,”
Melucci said. “I know in high
school they tell you winning
isn’t the most important thing,
but you feel better when you
win.”

He got ready before the first
pitch, his breath visible in the

cold air. Unconsciously, he cov- -

ered his face with his black

glove and then lowered it to his

waist and turned it skyward.
With his face covered, he

looked like a little leaguer, but

when he set himself, he was like
an aged veteran. Somehow, he
was both child-like and experi-
enced.

“When he was little, coaches
would ask him questions about
the rules or what to do,” _said

iMelucci’s mother Karen._

Pitt baseball Head Coach
Mark Jackson probably won’t
be asking for advice, but he did
recruit Melucci without ever
seeing him play.

A scout from the Atlanta
Braves and “a number of people
told us he was real good,”
Jackson said. “It is often diffi-
cult with first-year guys, but
Lou is doing well.”

Melucci was relaxed. He
seemed to fade into his position
at short stop, but he had been
noticed. He was both a standout
player and an integral part of his
team.

“Lou does a lot of things [that
fit into our system], likebunting
and running,” Jackson said.

In the bottom of the third
inning, Melucci came to bat for
the first time in the game. His
lead-off bunt crawled down the
third base line, and he made it
safely to first.

“Do you think he likes to
bunt, or would he rather go for
power?” someone asked
Melucci’s mother.

“When your coach says,
‘Jump,’ you say, ‘How high?”’
she replied.

On his next turn at bat,
Melucci drove a chest—high shot
deep into left field between the
third baseman and short stop.
He finished the day with a .375

Pitt wrestler Pat Wiltanger placed eighth at the NCAA tournament held last
weekend, earning All-American honors. Pitt placed 24th in the country.

 

  

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

Another fairly successful wrestling season is
history. The Pitt wrestling team closed out the
year by sending five wrestlers to the national
tournament last weekend in Minneapolis,
Minn.

The top eight finishers at each weight class
earned All-American honors. Pitt had two All-
Americans, Mark Bodo at 190 pounds and
heavyweight Pat Wiltanger, and 142-pounder
J .J . Fasnacht nearly made it three. As a team,
Pitt finished in 24th place.

Bodo was Pitt’s top finisher, coming in sixth
place. Michigan State’s Brian Picklo beat
Bodo on a takedown with no time left in over-
time to snatch fifth place away. ,

“It’s not often that you’re All-American your
first time at the championships,” Head Coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “He’s an even-keeled
kid. His temperament helped him.”

The fact that Bodo was even wrestling for
fifth place is evidence of his persistence. His
consolation quarterfinal match against
Northern Iowa’s Tony Wieland went to a
tiebreaker. Bodo was working from the bottom
position and after two failed attempts to
escape, Bodo had one last chance with four
seconds left. .

“He didn’t stand up again. He opened up and
got- an escape at the buzzer,” Stottlemyer said.
“He didn’t get too flustered and he found a
way to win.”

Wiltanger had a more painful route to his
All-American status. In the quarterfinals, he
faced top-seeded Tolly Thompson of Nebraska.

“He put Pat up like a twig and put him down
hard. I thought he dislocated his shoulder,”
Stottlemyer said. _ _

That ended the quarterfinal match, and it
almost ended the tournament for Wiltanger. He
was allowed to continue, but he was forced to
call frequent time outs, something he rarely

batting average.

“Lou is a heads-up player. Usually, when you get a kid who
was coached by his father, he is a heads-up player,” Jackson said
of Melucci, whose father coached him in high school.

With his team at bat, Melucci doesn’t stand in the dugout to
wait, but rather outside, like a coach. He both plays and watch-

CS

“I like to be away but still into the game following every

pitch,” Melucci said. “I like to be the first one on the field after

three outs sometimes.”

“He is a student of the game,” Karen Melucci said. “He never
wore team logos or anything like that. He just watched the game

for the game.”

After the victory, Melucci waited for his parents. The 5-10,
170-pound short stop transforms back into the Pitt freshman
who arrived here even before his 18th birthday.

“He is very intelligent,” Karen Melucci said, smiling with

pride.

Melucci, a high school honor student who averaged 92 per-
cent, confesses that college is harder.

“In high school, they kind of spoon-feed you.” he said. “I fig-
ure I have four years of baseball left. The education is what is

important.”

Wrestling,

does.

After the injury, Wiltanger
fought off llth-seeded Jerry
McCoy. The 4-3 decision
guaranteed a top eight finish
for Wiltanger. _

“I feel really good for him.
He’s had a tough career and
his work finally paid off. He
may not appreciate it now,
but down the line he will,”

A Stottlemyer said.

Pitt’s other senior went out
in less ceremonious fashion.
J.J. Fasnacht seemed-to be

' Pitt’s designated scapegoat.

“It seemed like all the calls
that went against us went
against J.J.,” Stottlemyer
said.

Such a call ended
Fasnacht’s tournament in the
consolation round. Against
Iowa State’s Derek
Mountsier, Fasnacht was
assessed a one-point penalty
for fleeing the mat. That
point was the difference, as
Mountsier won a 5-4 deci-
sion. _

“They were about as even
as you can get. It’s a shame

that call was a deciding fac-

tor,” Stottlemyer said.

To put. salt on the’ wound,
Fasnacht- would have been an
All-American if he hadwon

that match.

“He was as close as you
can get without" getting’
there,” Stottlemyer said.

Jacob Schaus put on a
good show at his first nation-
al tournament.

“Jake loves the limelight.
He just lights it up,”
Stottlemyer said.

He upset Oklahoma’s
Byron Tucker in the first
round and in his next match,
he nearly pinned Ernest
Benion’ of Illinois, who went
on to finish second at 158
pounds. Schaus was elimi-
nated when Maryland’s
Patrick Flynn beat him by
one point on ride time.

In two previous trips to
nationals, 167-pound junior
Bryan Matusic had not won a
match. This year, he won
two,,the most impressive
coming in the first round.

With 30 seconds to go, he

was losing to Ohio State’s
Will Knight by three points.
A Matusic escape, a stalling
penalty on Knight and a
takedown with 10 seconds
left“ gave the match to
Matusic.
' Pitt finished 24th in the
cou-n_try-with 19 points. Iowa
easily won the meet with
122.5 points.

Next year, we promise not
to outsmart ourselves. Just
because Kentucky lost a con-
ference tournament game
does not mean that they are
ripe for an early upset. Just
because John Chaney has a
great reputation does not
make Temple a contender.
And just because UConn
won the Big East does not
give them a ticket to the
Meadowlands.

Next year, we promise not
to buy into tournament
myths. Sure, Syracuse
always loses early, but that
can change. Yes, the ACC is

\ a very strong conference, but

not always. Maybe UCLA
has a great tradition, but Lew
Alcindor has been through a
name change and a film
career since they were a
solid tournament selection.
Next year, we promise not

to go overboard. No more
picking teams based on
Ouija boards or coin ﬂips.
No more “good feelings”
about 13th seeds who are
destined for greatness, or

. buying UNC-Charlotte and

Texas Tech merchandise in
early March because you

' think they have “legitimate

shots” at the title.

Next year, we promise to
stay on.topic. A mascot is
not a good tiebreaker for a
tough bracket decision. A
previous meeting between
the two teams in 1968
shouldn’t have any effect on
the outcome. And no more
judging teams by how well
last year’s seniors are doing
in the NBA this season.

Finally, next year, we
promise not to listen to the
experts. Dick Vitale is not
perfect. Digger Phelps can’t
be right all the time. Pat
O’Brien...well, nobody lis-
tens to Pat O’Brien.

' There. Group therapy fin-
ished. Remember your vows,
and next season, you too can
be a tournament guru.
