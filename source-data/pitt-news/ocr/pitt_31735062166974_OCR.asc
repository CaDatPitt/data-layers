SG Awards
Travel Aid
To Students

The Student Government is
sponsoring an Overseas Travel
Award of $500 to be awarded
on Tap Day. The award is open
to anyone except seniors, since
one of the desired resul-ts of the
award is that the student return
to the University to relate his
ex-periences. The money for the
overseas travel may be used in
any manner the applicant wish-
es. Applications are available at
the SU Desk and must be com-
pleted by Feb. 23. Students
should direct additional ques-
tions to Ken Frederick or Tom
Meisner.

The Overseas Travel Award
replaces the S Award of several
years ago, which was given to
students by both Stu-dent Go-v-
ernment and other student or-
ganizations.

AWS ELECTIONS

Women’s elections for Ban-
hellenic Council, AWS, Quo
Vadis and Woman’s Chorale

Committee Chairman Cites
View of Drug Price Levels

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

The purpose of the Small
Business Antimonopoly
Subcommittee investigating
drug prices, according to
Senator Gaylord Nelson of
Wisconsin, is to explore the
areas for pricing structure, com-
petition, and advertising at the
retail level of the drug industry.

Senator Nelson, chairman of
-the co-m.mi~ttee, spoke at the SU
Ballroom Sunday night. The pur-
pose of his lecture, sponsored
by Alpha Zeta Omega, interna-
tional pharmacy fraternity, was
to “explore questions of valid
public interesting” concerning
his committee.

Claiming “no pretense of ex-
pertise in any aspect of science,”
Senator Nelson said that his

committee relies on scientiﬁc in-
formation from the testimony
of doctors, pinarmacologists, and
other members of the medical
profession. He said that the drug
industry is vi-olently opposed to
the hearings. of his committee.
He pointed out that although
every drug manufacturer in the
US has been invited to testify,
only one comp-any has volun-
teered testimony.

Nelson said that his commit-
tee is no-t anti-drug industry. He
stated that the committee is
aware of the contribution of in-
dependent research to the health
industry. He emphasized, how-
ever, that this does n-ot mean
that the drug industry is per-
fect or that certain practices do
not need reform through legis-

lati-on.

‘Hitlerism in Russia’

Pollock Studies Jew In Russia

by DIANE BLOCH

In the eyes of the rest of the
world, Stalin openly supported
the establishment of the State
of Israel, while at the same
time continued his last purge of
the Jews in Russia. This fact
was expressed by Dr. Allen Pol-
la-ck, assistant professor of Rus-
sian history at the University,
in his talk on “World War II
and After: Hiutlerism Comes into»
Russia” Monday night at the YM
and WHA.

From 1941-45, Russian was be-
ing invaded by Hitler's forces.
In the middle of the war, Stalin
resurrected the Jewish commun-
ity in order to create the Jew-
ish Anti-Fascist Committee, a
government supported commit-
tee which was formed only to
improve world sentim-ent toward
the Soviet Union. The com-mit-
tee went abroad during t-he four
years of its existence and pre-
sented a false view of the Jew-
ish position in Russia, stated
Dr. Pollack.

The Jewish community, as
such, during the Second World
War, was only a ﬁgment of Stal-
in’s imagination because there
was no organized Jewry at all
in Russia. “In 1948,” said the
professor, “the Jews were the
only nationality in Russia who
were not represented at all.”

Toward the end of Stalin’s
reign, there was an increase of
Russian national spirit. This left
no place for the Jews who were
left in Russia. The Jews had
contacts abroad and could be
called disloyal to Russia.

“In 1949, when the State of Is-
rael was established, these feel-
ings about Jewish disloyalty in-
creased. Official anti-Semitism
was intensiﬁed and literary at-
tacks on the Jews became more
numerous.” Pollack emphasized
that the arrests of Jews were
never officially attributed to an-
ti-Semitic policy on the part of
the Soviet government, but were
disguised as reaction to the con-
spiracy of the Jews against the
Russian government.

Dr. Pollack then talked about
the rehabilitation of the Jews af-

‘fer /1953. De-Staliniza-tion was

taking place during this time

and the Police State was at its
end. The Jew no longer had to
be afraid for himself, but there
was no hope of a future for any
form of organized Jewish com-.
munity life.

He then began to express the
impact of World War II in de-
termining the Russian attitude
toward the Jews. During the
war, Stalin did not treat the
Jews with any concern. He knew
that the Jews would be the first
to be exterminated when the
Germans invaded Russia, but he
did not let the Jews know ‘this.

In Eastern Europe, local colla-
boration was evident in anti-
Jewish attitudes. Lithuania, the
Ukraine, and Poland welcomed
the Germans because the Ger-
mans would protect them from
Russian rule. Thus Stalin, who
didn't want to lose the Ukraine
to the Germans, had to adopt a
policy in which he could not op-
pose the German’s anti-Jewish
views. To allow the Jews so-me
respite after the war would be
dangerous to the Russian posi-
tion and therefore it was impos-
sible.

The role of the Federal Drug
Administration (FDA) “in pro-
tecting the public interest” is in-
adequately performed, accord-
ing to Nelson, due to inadequate
personnel and -funds. He men-
tioned that reforms are badly
needed in the area of inspec-
tion of drugs at the factory and
market levels.

Nelson. stated that there is a
deﬁnite lack of reliable infor-
mation on drugs. He said that-
there is no independent list of
both generic and brand names
stating the purpose and side ef-
fects of the drugs. He feels that
prescribing practices are related
to this lack, stating that “the
drug industry has, through ad-
vertising and promotion tech-
niques, successfully molded doc
tors and pharmacists into a do-
cile captive audience.”

“Advertising by the drug in-
dustry,” stated Nelson, “is sub-
-tle and effective." He stated that
advertisements are misleading
and lead to overprescription. He
contends that testimony before
his committee showed that ad-
vertising disguised the evils of
certain drugs, and overempha-
sized their attributes. Nelson
feels that advertisement should
clearly state the limitations of
drugs. ‘

“Part of the problem in pric-
ing structure,” according tc Nel-
son, “lies in the practice of pre-
scribing brand rather than gen-
eric names.” He explained that
if industry discovers a drug‘,
they give it a brand, as well as
a generic name and take out a.

17 year patent on it.

Guitarist Folk Singer Performs
As ‘Pit’ Reopens For This Week

by BETH LAZERICK

“1 write »a lot of my own material and college audiences are a good proving ground,” corn-
mented Gamble Rogers at the opening of the second “Pit” Coffee House Monday evening. Play-
ing his guitar and singing in the Hunt Room of the -Student Union, Rogers presented a variety
original and familiar folk songs, as well as instrumental selections, during his two shows.

Rogers brushed his face and then the strings of his guitar before beginning his show. In
his modiﬁed Southern drawn he explained, “It’s an old Southern custom!” The entertainer fol-
lowed this ritual with an original song and a lively rendition of “Frankie and Johnnie” which met

with great audience approval.

‘ “The Lord gives me grace
and the Devil gives me style,”
sang Rogers. Seeming to enjoy
the humorous, the singer pres-
ented several songs that the
audience reacted to with smiles.
“In order to have a good cred-
it rating you have to stay in
debt. . . . That's what they mean
by the gross national product!”
was one of Roger's lyric re-
marks.

For the song “Egyptian Ella”
members of the Student Union
Board helped with the lighting
in order to stimulate a silent
movie. With the use of a regu-
lar drinking glass, Rogers was
able to further add to the illu-
sion presented by the ballad.

Rogers, coming from an en-
gagement at Pennsylvania State
University, will play at the Uni-
versity through Saturday. The
Coffee House is open tonight
and tomorrow night from 8 to
11 p.m. and 8,to midnight Fri-
-day and Saturday.

Scientists Appeal to US

.» Professors Ask Halt
Of Military Research

Over 400 French and Japanese
university scientists appealed
last week to their American col-
league-s to refuse to allow their
universities to be used for mili-
tary and secret research. Citing
the “ethical and professional re-
spon-sibilities” of the world sci-
entiﬁc community to refuse
willingly to permit their discov-
eries to be utilized for destruc-
tive purposes, the foreign schol-
ars indicated that a continua-
tion of military functions on
American campuses would “lead
to the determination of an ever-
growing number of world sci-
entists and universities to inter-
rupt their relations” with in-
volved US universities, endang-
ering traditionual scientiﬁc ex-
changes and conferences among
world scholars.

The statement especially des-
ignated university-based re-
search in chemical and biologic-
al warfare and other techniques
of warfare against civilian pop-
ulations as a “grave violation”
of professional ethics.” The sign-
ers suported those numerous
American scholars who have op-
posed the war in Vietnam.

The declaration, which was
initiated by a nurnber of schol-
ars including Prof. Laurent
Schwartz of the University of
Paris, is also a response to the
controversy over military and
classiﬁed research which has
wracked so many American uni-
versities in the past two years.

In ﬁscal 1967, the Defense De-
partment allocated $449 million
in research contracts to Ameri-
can universi-t.ies, and in the prior
year over 40 universities held
contracts for chemical warfare
research. In the past year, how-
ever, such schools as the Univer-
sity o-f Pennsylvania, Cornell,
New York University, and Minn-

esota have moved to eliminate -

such research.

Among the 390 French signa-
tories were Professors J. P.
Kahane. B. Malgrange, F. Bru-
hat, C. Chevalley, D. L-acombe,
J. Neveu, P. Samuel Jean, R.
Nataf, Baruch, Fetizon, Lederer,
and Magat of the Faculties of
Science of the Universities of
Paris or Orsay, Professors B.
Dreyfus and H. P. Klotz of the
Faculty of Medicine of the Uni-
versity of Paris, Professor H.
Del-ange of the Institut Henri
Poincare, and Drs. R. Balian, F.
Pham, A. Messiah, Saint-J-ames,
and B. Ayraut of Saclay.

Japanese endorsers of the
statement include Kinji Iman-
ishi, president of Gifu Universi-
ty; Seiho Nishi, former presi-
dent of Gumma University; Fu-
gio Egami, vice-president of the
Japan Science Council; and Tos-
hizo Chitani, dean of science of
Josei University.

It is likely that leading sci-
entists in other countries will
also endorse the statement or
prepare those of their own.

For more information, contact
Professor Laurent Schwartz, 37,
rue Pierre Nicole, Paris-5eme.

The scinetists’ statement reads
as follows:

TO OUR SCIENTIFIC
COLLEAGUES IN THE
UNITED STATES

OF AMERICA:

A signiﬁcant number of Amer-
ican universities are working di-
rectly for the war in Vietnam.
Some of their departments are

, /_,

 

with herbicides utilized against
crops and plants, napalm, phos-
phorus bombs, and toxic gases;
others are participating in bio-
logical research intended for
purposes of war. To us, such
activity appears to be a grave
violation of the essential com-
mitments of science as a voca-
tion. Scientists have vast ethic-
al and professional responsibil-
ities in the modern world. If
they are to work for the beneﬁt
of humanity and the integrity
of scholarship they should nev-
er willingly permit their discov-
eries to be exploited for destruc-
tive purposes. For these reasons
scientists cannot allow their uni-
versities, the most important
centers in the world for scienti-
ﬁc research, to serve as experi-
mental laboratories for military
purposes. It is a matter of fun-
damental principle that all uni-
versities are devoted to the con-
cept of open research, the re-
sults of which are freely avail-
-able to all, and they are op-
posed to research Whose nature
and conclusions are secret.

We know that many of you are
actively opposed to the war and
w-e support your energetic and
courageous actions, for scholars
throughout the world condemn
the war in Vietnam. The contin-
uation of military activities in
American universities would in-
evitably lead to the determina-
tion of an ever-growing num-
ber of world scientists and uni-
versities U0 interrupt their re-
lations with certain American
universities engaged in military
research, and this would be the

_ruin of international scien-tiﬁc

exchanges which are the main
source of scientiﬁc progress for
us all.

We urge our American col-
leagues to refuse all collabora-
tion in experiments unanimous-
ly considered as war crimes and

especially to refuse the use of
their own university for war
purposes, often done without
their consent or even their-know-
ledge.

Throughout the world, univer-
sities must remain centers of
international collaboraition, peace
and liberty.

Everyone turns in their draft
cards for “personal reasons”
noted Bob George in his talk
last Friday night at the Crumb-
ling Wall. George, a former stu-
dent who hras turned in his draft
card, was quick in pointing out
that there is no “Communist
conspiracy” involved.

George is a member of a na-
tional draft resistors group
whose headquarters is in New
York City. The purpose behind
this group is to offer legal help,
money, and publicity to those
resisting the draft. The group
will also help these resistors
ﬁnd jobs, after they have served
jail sentences——up to ﬁve years.

George outlined the proceed-
ures and consequences involved
in turning in draft cards. “The
draft cards are usually turned

“Some resisters have gone as
far as to burn their cards and
send in the ashes. After the
cards have been turned in-, the
FBI usually rn=a;kes an investiga-

“The investigation is followed
by an induction notice. When in-
duction is refused, a. grand jury

indictment follows. A Jail sen-

outcome of the trial.

George said -the young men
resisting the draft acted so that
“they could live with them-

willing to accept the responsibil-

related consequences.

 i Editorial: Honoraries-The Credibility Gap -

   

S liwednesday, ran-nary 14, 1968

With the occurrence of Tap Day in two weeks, honoraries are now
in the process of planning their tapping meetings. The names of those
honored this year may be different, but we assert that for the most part
they have quite a lot in common. And in this similarity lies the root of
the problem with our University’s honoraries.

The word “honor” has obvious connotations. Somehow, we find it

difficult to equate this quality with the actual results of the tapping
meetings of our-leadership honoraries. Oh, in principle they espouse the

I "lvery best, but in practice it has turned out to be an entirely different

story. This is not to say that everyone tapped into honoraries is unde-
serving; on the contrary, many fine people are duly recognized. What
we cannot accept is that all too many students are either chosen or
excluded for the wrong reasons. What are these reasons? Perhaps a
student’s political affiliation (in terms of school politics) has alienated

 those chosen few who are in an honorary, Or perhaps he just isn’t liked
by a sufficient number of people to exclude him from a particular hon-

orary.
We cannot deny that a subjective element is everpresent in any
form of selective process. However. this does not mean we must condone
the petty actions of those students who may have been fortunate enough
to be tapped themselves, but after being accepted prove their unworthi-

   

ness of that honor by virtue of their conduct as a member.

The problem does not rest solely with those qualified students who
are denied membership in a leadership honorary for the Wrong reason.
Another factor to be considered is the type of student admitted. All too
often a student can move from one honorary to another by virtue of
being unobtrusive. If he has nottaken any real stands, either by choice
or chance, he is anatural to be classified a leader.

Perhaps the real problem lies in our multiple definitions of leader-
ship on this campus. To some, a leader is one who has proven himself
by the stands he has taken" and his positive contribution to activities in
terms of his leadership roles. To others, it is one who has collected the
sufficient number of titles to technically qualify him as a leader. One
may meet the paper qualifications, and if he seems pleasant enough,
he’s in.

We urge those students who are members of leadership honoraries
to do some real soul searching before they attend their respective tap-
ping meetings in the next several days. We must never forget that our
student activities can only be as strong as is our student leadership.
Why deter able students" because of a purely personal reason? Let’s
make this year a real exception by restoring credibility to our honor-
aries. Let’s recognize real leadership, not a weak fascimile.

On Criticism

The Need For Support

“THE SUPPLEMENT ,WASN"i‘ necessary,”

 said one student. “They don’t have it as bad as

they say,” said another. A third noted, “The
that weren't

there before.”
And so the majority of the opinions to the

eight-page supplement to last week’s Pitt News
. Nvent. In regard t-o the attention brought to the
a. life of Negroes on campus by the supplement,

many students felt there is no prejudice here,

land the attention to the Negroes will only cause
trouble.

problems here that warranted special attention

* s more so than the life of the Negro at Pitt. Added
g to the co-mments of the students was the usual

I criticism they offer about the paper, many add-
- . ingthat they could do a much better job.

THERE IS A COROLLARY between the ma-
jority“of the response to the Negro supplement

and the fact that many students criticize The .
‘ Pitt News, the administration, Student Govern-

ment, etc. It takes a little of one’s time, energy,
pride and ideas to solve problems and to have
top-notch organizations.

If all the students offered nothing more than
criticism, there would be no Pitt‘ News; no ad-
ministration; no athletics. If all students thought
only of themselves, soon the school would be

 nothing but c1asses—and problems. Problems do
. not solve ‘themselves, as s-ome students said in

reference to the supplement.\
The attitude of the students when it came
down to the supplement was either, “I get along

W I with Negroes and I don’t think the problem is
‘as bad as they all say,” or “The problem doesn't

bother me, and I don’t really care.” In other

words, “Why expose something that isn’t on the

surface?”
W IN OTHER WORDS, “Let everything go in

 its predetermined course, I’ll just sit back and
A watch, thank you. I do as much as I can or will.”

Or, “I just don’t care, I have problems of my

i own. My fraternity is more important. My soror-

 ity is more important. I have to worry about my
: classes. My commuting takes all my free time.
" Let someone else worry about it.”

Well, students of Pitt, the time has come

 when your attitude is typical of the attitude of
I the majority of Americans, young and old. Every-

one is quick to either criticize -or admit that they
do. their share for their school, or their country.

Take a look at where the country is going:
to socialistic ideas, where the government takes

, care of its lazy people with aid, welfare, social

security, medicare. And what Clo these benevo-

lant citizens have to offer in return? Criticism.

“QUICK T0 CRITICIZE, and slow to act,”.

could well be the way the historians of the fu-
ture sum up our generation. -

So what do you, the individual, do? Right
now. Think about it. Are you thinking “He’s
not talking to me, I’ do my share,” or are you
beginiiing to formulate criticism already? Well
in eithei case, there is something you can do
about it.

The first thing to do is to re-ally think about
it. Then, if you have any ideas, send a letter to
"f-he Pill News. And, if a let-ter isn’t sufficient,
go up to the offices and write a column. Or,if
you can't write ‘that well, you must know a
friend that can. Urge him or her to try it.

BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. As many

students said, there are other problems in the
school you can help with. The first could be the
dilemma facing ‘the baseball team. If you don’t
know what it‘ is, ﬁnd out. They could represent
your school on a national level, if you support
them. A .
The other athletic teams here need your sup-
port, too. Next year's football team has unknown
potential-—but they will need the support of
every student to be their best. Next year will
also be the ﬁrst year for a new basketball coach.
He will need the support of the student body to
do his best. . '

A Student Government could use your support,
too. So could the other organizations on cam-
pus. The supplement only brought out one of
many problems here that need support rather
than criticism.

SOME PEOPLE, however, will never care.
They don’t care about the problems o-f the Ne-
gro students, or the white students, or of. any-
one but themselves. They want their degree, and
then :1 job. And when they have a job, they will
sit back and let the government take care of
the rest. What will they add to their govern-
ment? Criticism.

When the government takes care of its peo-
ple, individuality is lost. When ten or 15 men

‘~ have control of a country, ‘trouble is inevitable.

How can a few men do what is best for the
masses, if the masses offer nothing but criticism.
“Do this, do that for me. I'll do nothing, though.”

‘ Think about the supplement; think about your
school; think about your country. They are all
very different, yet they all need your help, for
they are part of your life. They all represent
problems that can be solved only by work, un-
derstanding, and personal sacriﬁce; not criticism.

What Is Wrong — I

A Case F or Spirit

by Dan Lichtenstein

The spirit at athletic events in the University is prob-
ably better than at almost any other school in the country.
There is real enthusiasm here, and there can be as great a
din of cheering in Fitzgerald Field House as ever was
heard in Philadelphia’s infamous Palestra, or as much re-
sponse to cheer leaders during a football game as Notre
Dame could ever hope to have. _

Because this support for athletics is so infrequent,
everyone assumes it does not exist. But the support does
exist, and when it arises, it is a thrilling thing to experi-
ence just because it is so rarely obvious.

There could not possibly have been more than 100
people at last week’s basketball game with Kent State‘,
and for most of the game, the loudest noises were made
by the ball bouncing off the" Panthers’ heads and by a
group of obnoxious students shouting cat-calls from be-
hind the Kent bench. Then two things happened that

turned on the crowd. Pitt began to cut Kent’s 15 point .

lead, and center Charlie Hunt tried to bounce Kent’s cen-
ter off the floor instead of the basketball. The noise and
enthusiasm that followed were genuine and in full sup-
port of Bob Timmon’s athletes. It was hard to realize that
only about 100 people were making that racket.

The scene was reminiscent of the Navy, Army and
Syracuse football games of last fall. Heart-breaking games
with Navy and Syracuse elicited fantastic support and
standing ovations for the Panthers. After the Notre Dame
debacle, the cynical loser’s attitude returned until half-
time of the Army game when in an exhibition of spirit that
could not have been topped even in the 1963 9 and 1 sea-
son, the tiny crowd responded to a Pitt lead by’ forming a

- hundred-yard tunnel for the team returning from the lock-

erroom. . -

Probably because the athletic teams have been so hor-
rible for the past few years, any indication of victory pro-
duces a gigantic response from the students, twice as great
as that of blase UCLA or Notre Dame rooters. Doesn’t
this fact make it obvious that the spirit, and enthusiasm
are there? We are ready, willing and quite able to cheer
and throw full support behind the athletes; it's just that
we’re frustrated. It’s painful to watch your team com-
pletely out-classed; so why trudge up to the stadium or
field house to watch something that hurts? You feel silly
trying to generate enthusiasm when a game is completely
out of reach; so why not amuse yourself by making cracks
and cheering for an opponent as he runs up the score?

The athletic department has no right to place all the
blame for lack of support upon the students. Don’t they
think that we would respond to a winner? They haven’t
given us one. Thousands of people turn out to watch a
Gary Beban or a Lew Alcindor. If the University coaches
want better attendance, they’ll have to start recruiting
some stars.

These are not just idealistic statements. The victori-
ous, star-laden freshman track team draws terrific at-
tetion to a “minor” sport. .

p It’s a viscious circle. Some people blame the cheer-
leaders, but they must feel ridiculous performing cheers
while hundreds of students just sit and silently gawk at
them. No one will come alive for a loser anyway. The
coaches say that better support might help, but until they
giae, us something to support, they’ll be pleading to deaf
ears Ia/Inld dumbfrgouths. '

Letters To The Editor

Student Scores
Negro Coverage

Editor, The Pitt News:

I just ﬁnished reading the
special supplement, “The Negro
on Campus,” and while I gen-
erally agree with most of the
results your reporters found, I
was struck by the fact that
what anyone might call a rep-
resentative sample was sadly
lacking. How can one hope to
get any sort of reliable picture
of Pitt's image in predominently
Negro high schools by inter-
viewing only one student each
from two schools? Furthermore,
wasn’t the choice to girls who,
I gather, were extraordinarily
involved in ext.ra-curricular ac-
tivities obviously unrepresenta-
tive of the students at those
schools.

It was also disturbing to ﬁnd
that an Article comparing the
views of Southern versus North-
ern Negroes was based ,_on the
comments of only three Negro
students. A full page article sup-
posedly giving the “typical”
wh.ite’s impressions was based
on an informal discussion of
seven white students. And I
ﬁnd it absolutely unbelievable
that neither the Dean of Wom-
en nor the white girl who sup-
posedly had to see her after dat-
ing a Negro were contacted to
see what they had to say about
the matter.

While I realize that it may
have been impossible to be cer-
tain that all views were repre-
sentative, until some effort along
these lines is done, the supple-
ment can hardly even think of

standing as the results of a
searching study. For what it's
worth, however, your general
conclusions do seem to reflect
well what I understand are the
general student attitudes to be
from my own experience and
conversation with Negro stu-
dents I was friendly with in un-
dergraduate school as well as
the spoken views of Reverend
Robinson (a Negro from Man-
chester who ran for city office
in the last pimary election) and
from a more comprehensive but
similar study done at the Uni-
versity of Michigan by the stu-
dent daily newspaper.

Better Coaching

Editor, The Pitt News:

When I heard the news today
of the “resignation” of Bob Tim-
mons as basketball coach I greet-
ed it with wild elation. However,
as I listened to the television
press conference later that af-
ternoon-and evening my elation
was tempered by disappointment
when I heard your remarks per-
taining to basketball “policy”
and the conditions under which
the new coach would have to

work. They sounded to me as if ‘-

you have no real intention of
upgrading the sport of basket-
ball at Pitt but, on the contrary,
intend to merely perpetuate me-
diocrity, only with a new coach.

Then when I heard that Tim
Grgurich supposedly has the in-
side track” to succeed Timmons
my disappointment was com-
plete. I think it would be an ap-
palling mistake to elevate Grgu-

rich to head coach. My point is
simply this: You have an op-
portunity for the ﬁrst time in
15 years to appoint a decent
basketball coach. Why repeat
the mistake that Tom Hamilton
made by appointing a person
unqualiﬁed for the job. I believe
that you owe an obligation to
the students and interested alum-
ni o-f the University to select
the be-st possible man that you
can ﬁnd.

I have nothing against Grgu-
rich personally any more than I
had against Timmons personal-
ly. It is just that he is no-t the

best qualiﬁed for the job. I

think he is too young and cer-
tainly he hasn’t got the neces-
sary coaching experience.

I believe that you should look
for the type of man who is in a
situation similar to the one that
Dave Hart was in when you se-
lected him for football coach. In
other words, someone with a
solid background in high school
coaching who is presently either
a successful coach in a small
college who has ambition to
move up in class, or someone
who is presently an assistant at
a big time “basketball school.”

I am sure that there are many
such men available who would
be eager to have the opportun-
ity to meet the challenge of

making Pitt basketball some-
thing to be proud of and not
something to be scorned and
sneered at.

Says Modern Biology Professor

Stability Product of Evolution

by ALAN E. BARR

The concept of evolution em-
bodies “change, order, and di-
rection” pointed out Dr. Rich-
ard C. Lewontin in his lecture
Monday night.

According to Dr. Lewontin,
the modern outlook on evolution
differs from the 19th century
outlook. “In the 19th century,”
said Dr. Lewontin, “evolution
was thought to have a purpose
in that it brought about prog-
ress in the species. Today, evolu-
tionists consider evolution to be
a process that results in .s-tlability
among the species leading to
‘complexity for the sake of
stability.”

Dr. Lewontin stated that evolu-
tion as an acceptable idea came
after drastic social changes. Up
until the 18th century, man’s
place in the universe was con-
-sidered to be p-re-ordained. With
the bourgeois revolution, change
became a way of life which
made way for the idea of prog-
ress.

By the time of Darwin's Ori-
gin of Species, the middle class
had risen and change and prog-
ress were acceptable things. This
accounts for the belief that evol-
ution led to progress.

Now, this idea of progress is

discounted. The bourgeois revo-
lution “gave way to a period
of consolid-ation in which we
still ﬁnd ourselves.” Evolution
is presently concerned with stab-
ility among the species. It is
the study of movement and
change “without a set direction.”

Dr. Lewontin is a professor of
zoology and the associate de-an
of biological sciences at the Uni-
versity of Chicago. The lecture
was the fifth in a series spon-
sored by the University’s Cen-
ter for the Philosophy of Sci-
ence.

Track Fever 1

by Jay Rosenstein
Sports Editor

Over the course of last weekend, this writer was se-
verely infected with a disease which track fans across the
nation call “the Fever.”

Its bug attacks without warning. A spectator can fall

. victim when he tries to sit calmly as Jim Ryun surges to

the front of a darn good crop of milers and kicks the last
five laps for a 3 :57.5 indoor mile.

Or the fever can strike when Charley Greene whooshes

60 yards, as Earl McCullouch glides effortlessly over hur- V

dies, or when Bob Seagren strains his fiberglass pole al-
most to the breaking point as he attempts 1_7 feet.

For coach Jim Banner, as with all track coaches, the
real fever hits when one of his own is performing. And for
the writer, it grabs hold only when he grasps the differ-
ence between a race in a deserted backyard alley and one on
the walnut-stained boards of a vibrating arena.

Track is human confrontation. It’s also man versus a
clock, a bar, or a distance. As a result, each of the Pitt
athletes who accompanied Banner to New York and Balti-
more gained invaluable experience in their drive for na-
tional acclaim.

A LESSON FOR DAVE GARNETT

All Dave Garnett could do was sha_ke his head after‘

his fourth place (6.4) finish in his 60 yard heat. He had
tried to jump out and get a) quick start on Charley Greene

. (6.2) and O. J. Simpson (6.3), but the starter detected a

false start. .

“I got a good start in the second false start (not his ),”
recalled Garnett. “But the third was terrible. Greene left
me and right away I stoodup to chase him. That threw
everything off. Once he was by me, he was gone.

“I had hoped to meet Greene in the finals,” Garnett
continued. “I never thought I'd face him in the first race.”
The world record holder (5.9) taught Garnett a lesson
he won’t forget.

“Greene’s so relaxed, you know,” smiled the Pitt fresh-
man. “It’s allpsychological with him. We were on the
blocks and just before the start he turned to me and said,
‘This track’s a bitch, isn’t it?’. I was about to answer him
when the starter called.”

Garnett admits he “blew it. I lose one to two tenths of
a second in the blocks.” For that reason, Garnett says he’d
like another shot at,Greene. “I’ll wait for the outdoor sea-
son an.d meet him in the 100. It might be a different story.”

Banner had one comment about his sprinter on the
plane ride back from Baltimore. “He’s trying to be great
right away, instead of trying to be good now and getting
great slowly.”

EXPOSURE FOR JERRY RICHEY

“I expected it,” was Banner’s first reaction to Jerry
Richey’s 4:10«mile and a third place in Baltimore. “He
could have won either the mile or the two mile fresh.”
Josef Odlozil had captured the mile in 4:08.7 while Barry
Brown won at two miles in 8:58.

Richey described the Baltimore mile as follows. “Friday

night in the two mile, I was tired for the last quarter. So
at the start, I was thinking in the back of my mind, ‘I’m
not going to have any kick.’
I “In the middle of the race, I was really down. I think
that taking the lead (as he did) makes you tired. It kind
of psyches you out. I was hoping someone would take the
pace and I kept thinking that someone would pass me
soon.”

The entire field passed Richey--during the middle laps.

,He continued: “On the far turn, the co-ach and Bryant
(Salter) kept yelling at me. That picked me up. I felt

‘good’ again and I passed three guys in the straightaway.”

According to Banner, Richey’s two weekend races were
worth “35 practice sessions.” Someone asked the coach if it
might have been better to enter Richey in the “Collegiate
Mile’ in N.Y. instead of in the two mile against Gerry Lin-
gren and Sebsibe Mamo. “Not at all,” Banner emphasized.
“It was better to finish third behind two Olympians in
8:48.41 than to win against a weak field in 4:12. He would
have run away from them,”»Banner pointed out.

Richey was awed by his competition for the last time.
“Before the Baltimore race,” he revealed, “I remembered
seeing Odlozi‘l’s picture in 1964. I thought, ‘he’s an Olym-
pian, what am I doing against him?” Banner grinned when
told about Richey’s initial reaction. “Two Olympians last
night . . . one Olympian tonight,” he chuckled. Then think-
ing of Richey’s bright blue uniform labeled ‘Pitt Frosh’,

* Banner said, “It’s good to see Pitt in the big time again.”

Bill DelVecchio, a former Pitt Sprinter, and now with
the Philadelphia Pioneers, still has the fever. After Rich-
ey’s mile, DelVecchio offered reassurance.

“All you need is experience,” DelVecchio said to him.
I can’t re-

Paul’s Toss-up Sparks
Cubs’ Last Second Win 9

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
The freshman basketball team duplicated the college
bowl team’s‘winning technique by scoring on two important
toss-ups. Both shots were accompanied by the buzzer.

As the ﬁnst half buzzer -sounded, Mike Riggle crossed -the mid-
court line and pushed the ball with two hands thro-ugh the 
The basket cut the Westminster JV ’s lead to ﬁve, 36-31.

In the second half, the Cubs
started to hit more of their
shots. With 16:40 left to play
the freshman cagers tied the
score at 38-38, and ﬁnally took
the lead two and one half min-
utes later, 43-42. But they could-
n’t brake the game open as the
lead -changed hands eight more
times .in the last period.

The game couldn’t have been
any closer, and with the score
tied, 63-63, and seven seconds
remaining, Mike Caldwell miss»
ed. But the Cubs scrapped for
the ball and as the ﬁnal buzzer
sounded Mike Paultook a crazy
oﬂ’-balance jump shot that made
him the hero of the night.

“I thought Oaldwell was going
to win it for us,” explained
freshman basketball’ coach Tim
Grgurich. “He had the -open shot.
But then Paul jumped way to
his side and put it in.

Raul and Riggle would have
been last night's stars even if
they didn’t hit those two clutch
shots. Riggle’s shooting kept the
Cubs‘ in the game in the ﬁrst
half; he scored 15 of his 17
points before intermission.

And in the ﬁnal half, Paul
scored 17 of his 22 points to help
the Cubs win another close one.
Paul was the game's high scorer.

score seem more respectable. i ,

and then left the game with

have scored quite a ‘few more
points. The ﬁsh was the second

  In Field House Tonight

Winless Tracksters Meet Rockets

by DAVE TIERNAN

In the won-lost column,
this year’s varsity track
team is a carbon copy of last
year's. The thinclads hope the
pattern holds true tonight at
6:30 when they host Slippery
Rock at the Field House.

The Rockets were the only
-team the tracksters beat Last
year, and after lopsided losses
in their ﬁrst two meets, a win
would cheer the spirits of the
team which has been in the
shadow of the freshmen all sea-
son.

The return of captain Paul
Greig, who missed the meets

_with Kent State and Penn State

due to pneumonia, will add a
third star to the depthless track-
sters. Roger Holly and Greg
Ellis are the other two.

Holly, who has won both the
600 and 1000, and Ellis, who
holds the school shot-put record,
are the only double winners on
the team. Between the two of
them, they have accounted for

20 01 the team's 60 points.

..Greig outlined the strategy
for the meet tonight. “Slippery
Rock has good hurdlers and
sprinters, but our distancemen
will double and triple up to gain

<|l'k‘A'**'k**k*i'****

points,’ he said.

Greig will run in the mile and
twomile races, and hopes to
ﬁnd how much damage his stay
in the hospital did. “It would
be tiring enough to run the two
races within .an hour, but since
I haven’t really had a chance to
get back in shape—well, we’ll
see,” he noted.

Tom Christie and Carlos Reis-
en will be without the aid of
Dave Brinn in the hurdles. Brinn
pulled a tendon in his foot and

will not compete. Brinn had
earned a ﬁrst and a second in
the hurdles in the first two
meets.

Another bright spot could be
the luckless mile relay team. In
the Kent meet, Carl Wooten pull-
ed a thigh muscle during the
third quarter-mile and the deﬁ-
cit was never regained. Against
Penn State, Holly missed a step
in the ﬁnal turn and lost by just

that margin to the Lion anchor- ;

man.

BOB F'EHRS—A three-time na-

pound weight class. Fehrs is
now Dave Adams’ top assistant.

 

by ROY JACOBS

For those who know
wrestling, Bob Fehrs is no
stranger. He’s a three-time
national runner-up. Those who
aren't familiar with the sport
only kno-w Fehrs as Dave Adams’
mat assistant and freshman
coach.

Fehrs’ duels with Lehigh’s
Mike Caruso in the national 123
ﬁnals were classics. They met
three years running, and but for
some subjective thinking by a
referee, Fehrs might haVe been
the national -champ the third
time.

“Of course, I’m a little biased,”
reviewed Fehrs, “but I thought
the referee missed a couple of
points. He made two calls in
the last 45 seconds that affect-
ed the result.

“I did a pancake on Caruso
and threw him down,” he con-
tinued. “The ref gave me a take-
down but n-0 predicament. Then

JOE McCAIN and a berth in
the to-urney.

The Mets gained the lsem1i-ﬁ-
nlal spot [after making the en-
gineering title and a 46-33 deci-
sion from the Civil Engineers
last week. A ﬁrst round victory
(44-36) over the Panzees, inde-
pendent champs, placed MBA in
the semis.

With Delta Sig -trailing by
two points with only ﬁve sec-
onds remaining .in regulation
play, Joe McCain arched a long
desperation s.hot which missed
the mark, but a teammate tip-

ped in the rebound to throw
the game into the two-minute
overtime.

Delta Sig scored two quick
ﬁeldens in the overtime period
to grab a 53-49 lead. PiKA trim-
med the margin. to two points
but Delta Sig came back with a
fr-eeze to put the vict-ory and
the championship on ice.

PiKA held a slim 24-23 lead at
the halftime in the contest as
the outside shooting of Sam
Cosetello and Bill Claypoole off-
set the superior rebounding
strength of Delta Sig. In the
second half, both teams matched
outside shots, While any moves
inside usually reulted in fouls.

Joe McCain, hitting on long
sets and jumpers, led the win-
ners with 21 points. “Mae” Mc-
Elheny chipped in {With 16. Cos-
tello led all scorers «with 22.
Claypoole added 14 for PiKA.

Delta Sig earned the right to
meet PiKA, the undefeated
league “B” champs, after a 49-
43 playoff victory over Sigma
Chi to determine the “A” king.
Delta Sig not only -claimed vic-
tory in the game last Thursday,
but also in the ﬁght which
broke out on mid-court after a

 

and Caruso sort of picked me
up as we rolled off. He got a
reversal. I thought it was just
an escape.”

A predicament would have
been worth two points for Fers
h-ad it been awarded. An escape
is worth one less than a re-
versal. The ﬁnal score was 7-6
in flavor of Caruso, so the two
judgments were costly to Fe-hrs.

But that was last year. Now
Ferhs is out of competition and
busily working for his Masters
in physical education. Besides
school, he is wrestling coach
Dave Adams’ right hand man,
and Adams most certainly ap-
preciates his presence.

“As an «assistant coach, I
-couldn’t have picked a better
man,” remarked Adams of
Fehrs’ choice to come to Pitt.
‘‘I don’t know how I would have
gotten along this year without
him. He’s been a tremendous

scuffle for a rebound.

In the hotly contested game,
Delta Sig jumped out to a six
point lead at halftime. After in-
termission, Sig Chi narrowed
the margin to two points, 37-35.
Trailing by two, Sigma Chi got
possession on a fast break, but
blew the lay-up. The ﬁght for
the rebound turned into a free-
for-all on the court as both play-
er-s_and fans start-ed swinging
freely until officials cleared the
court.

Chuck Winters led Delta Sig’s
scoring attack with 14 points.
Joe McCain, Ed Whittaker and
Lou Parrott chipped in with 11.
George Medioh led the losers
with 15.

Scoring was distributed even-
ly among the Mets in their title
game. Chuck Davies was high-
man with eight points and Bill
Clark, RJl‘Ch B-enedetti, and Phil
Delmar followed with six points
each.

John Mccarnthey had the
scoring honors, tapping in ten
points for the C-ivils.

Kevin McGuinness’ 14 points
paced MBA to their win and Bill
DiPietro tossed in 11 points for
the graduates.

Dean Coleman Stricves and Drives

Toward His Magic

by ART ROSENGARTEN V
The swish of water slap-
ping against the sides of the
pool is the only noise that
breaks the silence. Alone and
erect at the edge of the one me-
ter b-card stands Dean Coleman,
ready to‘ take off and perform
his diving feats in hope of
notching -a first place for the
swimmers.
Meet after meet the hopes for
a quick ﬁve point-lead rest up-
on Dean's broad shoulders. This
is asking a great deal from an
athlete who had been diving for
only six years, and having been
coached for just the last two.
“The coach and I feel that ii"
I could of had a couple of years
instruction before last year that
I could have been one of the
best in the East," said Dean.
“But I have no regrets. Diving

A ' has given me a great deal.”

for what to him is a magic
nuniber, 200 points in a meet.
“’l‘h9 b:-st that I've done is 191,
but I am gunning for 200 in the
upcoming meets; and hopefully
in the Easterns.” ’

Dean competes from both the
one and three meter boards. “I
like the low board better, but
for some reason I score higher

on the three meter. I don't have R‘
a. _11igh,.deg1jee, oft ..,di,ff§5=u1tyl .011 .

  

the three meter board which
probably adds to my success
there.

“My best dive is the same on
both the high and low boards,”
says Coleman. “On the one me-
ter I do an inward on-e and a
-half in tuck position, while on
the three meter I do it in the
pike position. This was the ﬁrst
high degree of difficulty dive
(2.2) that I learned in high
school. When I get up in the
air, I know that I can hit it and
I give it that little extra.

The dive that gives Dean the
most trouble is the back one
half summersault and the re-
verse one half summersault.
“When I'm in the air I have no
idea of ‘my position with the
water. I have to depend tota.lly
on timing.”

Although Adams thinks of
Fehrs primarily as an assistant,
Bob will have the job of di-
recting the freshman wrestlers
against Lehigh’s fresh Satur-
day night. It should be a good
test.

“They have a well balanced
team,” commented Fehrs. “It’ll
be a pretty tough meet. We have
some pretty good kids, but their
balance is better than ours.”

He explained that in a big
tournament it doesn't matter
much if one or two boys lose,
but in a dual meet more bal-
ance is necessary. To make mat-
tens wo-rse, middleweight Buddy
Morris will miss Saturdoay’s
meet, and Skip Frenzel a 167
pounder, will wrestle 191.

These freshmen are new
around the Field House, too.
But if Fehrs can imbue them
with his winning spirit, people
will be hearing a lot from them.
