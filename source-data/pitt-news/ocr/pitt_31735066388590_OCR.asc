Bill would
tie tuition

cap to Pitt’s
statefitrzols

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

lfa proposed bill is passed, Pitt
will have to keep in-state tuition
increases below 6 percent to
receive its fiscal year 1992
appropriation from the
commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

“If Pitt decides to raise tuition
above 6 percent, they will not get
any of their appropriation,” said
Mary Soderberg, budget analyst
for House Appropriations
Committee Chairperson Dwight
Evans (D-Philadelphia). The
appropriations bill is currently
being considered in the House of
Representatives. .

In the past, Pitt has participated
in the Tuition Challenge Grant
program, which gave universities
$100 perin-state, full—time student
if they kept tuition increases
below 6 percent. This money
was given separately from the
general appropriation, and
universities had a choice about
whether or not to participate in
the program.

During this year's state budget
crisis, Gov. Robert Casey cut
funds for the program by 50
percent. The proposed bill
includes a tuition cap with the
general appropriation, allowing
schools to get the full amount of
incentive money they have gotten
in the past, Soderberg said.

The bill also stipulates that Pitt
cooperate with a study of
accountability in higher
education, Soderberg said.

This is “not an effort to
micromanage universities,”
Soderberg said. ‘‘It is an effort to
have the Department of
Education start taking a closer
look at what we are doing in
higher education and where we
need to grow.”

The same stipulations are also
being proposed for Lincoln and
Penn State universities.

The bill contains no increase

A literary agent named the predominantly
white publishing industry as the greatest

barrier to black writers.

Marie Brown, who spoke at the “Getting
Published” workshop at the Black Writers
Conference on Sunday, said it is difficult
for black writers to get published because
“publishing today is very white and very

Eurocentric."

held “informal meetings” each year.

The university has hired an independent law
firm to advise the trustees about altering Posvar’s
retirement settlement, said Popper, who also
serves as secretary to the board. A new board
compensation committee will meet Thursday.

The Sunshine Act requires government
agencies, including state—related universities, to
open their meetings to the public. An amendment
in 1987 required board committees to be covered

See Sunshine, page 5 '

Pitt’s general counsel said the private
interworkings of the Board of Trustees committee
which approved Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s
retirement package and recent pay raises
probably violated the intent of the state Sunshine
Act but may not have actually broken the law.

described the trustees as
“captives of history” who were

Posvar’s retirement settlement

House Appropriations
Committee Chairperson Dwight
Evans (D—Philadelphia)
proposed last week that Pitt
not receive an increase of
approximately $3 million in its

basic state subsidy because Pitt
officials “lied” about Posvar’s
retirement settlement.

Posvar, who wrote a five-
page apology to Evans last
Thursday, expressed “profound
regret" for withholding
information about his university
retirement package.

“Our credibility has been
damaged,” Posvar wrote. He

Hariette Cole, contemporary literature
editor of Essen,ceMagazine, said few works
are published because so many are
submitted. She said the large number of
writers provides tough competition at the
editor's desk.

“At most magazines 75 percent of 
letters offering a story idea are rejected.
And that figure is probably low,” said Cole.

Few books are written about African-
Americans, Brown said.

“Those who have managed to get
through the system are not African-'
American writers. They are ‘best-selling

According to Brown, few blacks work in
publishing.

“We have maybe five black editors [at
large publishing companies]. If you don't
have somebody inside, you're going to

Pitt Senate
endorses

ROTC plan

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

The University Senate Council
has decided to support a senate
committee’s recommendation
that Pitt’s ROTC be removed from
campus in 1997 unless the
Department of Defense changes
its policy banning gays and
lesbians.

The council endorsed the
recommendations of the ROTC
committee almost unanimously,
with one member abstaining.

The committee was formed to
study the conflict between the
DOD’s policy banning
homosexuals from the ROTC, and
the university’s policy prohibiting
discrimination based on sexual
orientation.

The council’s report states that
the ROTC must follow the rules
ofthe university, just as any other
Pitt group does. In recommending
that the ROTC be removed if the
DOD does not change its policy,
the committee allows for students
currently in the program to finis
their training at Pitt. I

The recommendations will now
be given to President—electJohn
Dennis O'Connor, who will
decide whether to implement the
recommendation.

Major Beverly Ertman, a Pitt
ROTC instructor, said that she
thought the committee’s findings
were fair.

“I think they acted responsibly,”
Ertman said. “The 1997 date gives
the Department of Defense time
to change its policy.”

Pitt’s ROTC is not currently
planning to fight the
recommendations, Ertman said.
ROTC’s only role is to report
Pitt’s recent actions to the
Department of Defense.

Pitt ROTC Cadet Morgan B.
Marietta said he disagrees with
the committee’s
recommendations.

“The appropriate response by
the university is to lobby the
Defense Department to change

for five years to get his novel on the
bookstore shelves.

“Louis was rejected over and over. I
submitted it for him and was rejected and
rejected. But if he had not been persistent,
it would never ‘have happened,” said
Brown.

Cole suggests that rejected queries be
followed up. Submitting them to another
magazine is also another option, said

Surgeons at Presbyterian
University Hospital and Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh have
recently performed the first
successful small-intestine
transplants.

“All patients are doing well,"
but we have to follow them very
carefully,” said Dr. Satoru T odo,
associate professor of surgery at
the University of Pittsburgh. The
two adults and three children
who underwent the procedure
two to 13 months ago have
regained their normal body
weights, Todo said.

The patients have short-gut
syndrome, a complication caused
by the surgical removal or
underdevelopment of the Small
intestine due to traumatic injury
or birth defects. Todo said that
only two to four persons per
million suffer from it.

“Between 200 and 400 patients
per year could benefit from this
procedure. We’re hoping to make
this procedure routine within the
next 5 to 5 years,” Todo said.

The use of the experimental
anti—rejection drug FK506 was
instrumental to the success,
according to Todo.

PKS06 has been much more
successful in keeping the
recipient’s immune system from
rejecting the donor tissue than
the standard anti-rejection drug
cyclosporine.

“MoSt of_ the reported small
intestine transplants failed
because of technical reasons,
infection or rejection,” Todo said.
“But rejection is the most
important problem that we have
to overcome.” Between 1980 and
the present, most of the 25 cases
failed because of rejection.

A normal small intestine absorbs
food nutrients into the
bloodstream, but when the small‘

intestine does not function
properly due to short-gut
syndrome, the only treatment for
the patient is total parenteral
nutrition. Long-term use of TPN
may destroy the liver because it
interferes with normal liver
metabolizing functions.

Todo said TPN costs between
$60,000 and $120,000 per year
per patient. TPN necessitated liver

transplants in four out of the five,

patients who received small-
intestine transplants.

T odo said that a liver transplant
costs between $200,000 and
$300,000. .

“The best way to view the
research into small—intestine
transplants is to compare it to the

.liver transplants developed by
Dr. Thomas Starzl. The first clinical
liver transplant was in 1963, and
everybody argued against it. Now,
thousands of patients who used
to die 30 years ago can be saved,"

its policy, not to attempt to
abolish “the program,”
Marietta said. “ROTC is an
integral part, not only of
this campus, but of our
armed forces. It would be
irresponsible of V the
university to interfere with
this long-Standing and
irreplaceable source of
military leaders.”

Marietta said 75 percent
of Army officers come from
ROTC programs. 1

“As both a cadet and a
student at Pitt, I hope that
I am not to be a vanishing
breed. Our nation truly
needs citizen-soldiers, and
ROTC is where you find
them. Pitt seems to be
forgetting its role in service
to our nation, as well as to
education,” he said.

By Tom McClure
For The Pitt News

Imagine a person completing
the coursework for a doctorate in
theater, and just before writing
the dissertation deciding to start a
doctorate in rhetoric.

Since this switch, Ted Windt,
an associate professor of political
communication at Pitt, has
developed and taught Presidential
Rhetoricl and II, worked as former
Governor Dick Thornburgh’s
' chief speech writer, done political
commentary for KDKA’s
“Weekend Magazine” and worked
as a political consultant out of
Washington, D.C. Windt has also -
had four political—rhetoric books

\ published, with another book due
out in September.

Windt switched from acting,

playwriting and directing to
pursue rhetoric because he
“wasn’t sure whether the reasons
President Kennedy gave for the
Cuban Missile Crisis were
sufficient for the action that the
United States took.”

In 1968, when Windt came to
Pitt, he originally taught Dramatic

Literature, Rhetoric ofDrama and

Playwriting. But in 1970, Windt
developed _and started teaching
his Presidential Rhetoric courses,
which are some of the most highly
enrolled undergraduate, elective
courses in Pitt’s College of Arts
and Sciences.

Windt said his classes may be
in such high demand because he
shows how the choices made in
politics relate to the students,
whether they are interested in
politics or not. In his classes

Windt discussed, what politicians
were saying during the Persian’
Gulf War.

One of \X/indt’s textbooks fbr
these courses, Presidential ‘
R/9et0n'c: ]96]—Present, was “the
first anthology in the field to
concentrate solely on presidential
rhetoric. Each speech in the text
was chosen for its political
importance. These speeches are
ones that affected each president's _
ability to exercise power,” _ 
according to Windt. A '

Presidential Rhetoric is now
taught at over a dozen universities,
many using Windt’s textbooks.
Students have commented that
\X/indt combines in-the—field
experience and political relevance
with a twist of congenial humor.

Schulman attacks trustees, charges

By~Dan Wonders

" ~ ‘Sta_[7‘Wriler

Trustees

Irwin Schulman’s anger over
the size of Wesley Posvar’s $3.3
million “golden parachute”
reaches beyond the president to
questions about the competency
of the university Board of
Trustees.

“The people who should have
known how much money Posvar
was getting, didn't. They didn’t
even display natural, human
curiosity over these questions,”
said Schulman, a member of the
Senate Council and a Pitt political
science professor. “Posvar’s
package was really off the charts
compared to other universities,

‘but all this is really an issue of

accountability,” Schulman said.

Continued from page 1
‘‘It was a chromium-plated,
double—breasted, neon-lighted
,mistake,” Trustee Ruggero
Aldisert said.

The board's compensation
committee has awarded the
outgoing Posvar nearly $100,000
in salary increases. .

“The last pay raise [in 1990]
came even after 31 members of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
drafted a resolution of no
confidence calling for Posvar’s
removal,” according to Schulman.

Last week, 60 members of the
FAS, Pitt’s largest academic group,
called for the resignation of the
entire board of trustees. While
Schulman has asked only for the
resignation of the board’s
executive committee, he said he
wonders who was minding the
store. ~

simply excessive. There are

“The people who created this
fiasco failed to meet their
responsibility, but most of them
are not going to feel they should
resign. Those that are deeply
involved aren’t going to resign
either because that would be seen
as a passive admission of guilt,”
said Schulman.

Schulman also proposed
slashing Posvar’s $201,600 annual
retirement pension in half and

“O’Connor has a real

institution. It will be a unique

said.

According to M arous, the

to the university caused the
board to ignore some of

university. .

“One of the reasons we

Hafer plans audit of university ’s financial records

By Dan Wonders
Stajf Writer

Following months of accusations and
reports of questionable spending practices
at Pitt, State Auditor General Barbara Hafer
has launched an in—depth review of the
university’s finances.

“Nothing like this has ever been done I

before,” Hafer said. “\X/e’re going in there,
opening up the books and reviewing all
Pitt salaries, contracts and fringe benefits.
All Pitt monies will be reviewed, not just
state funding.”

T Hafer said she began two weeks ago to
determine how the audit would be
performed and who would be involved.

She said she had intended to conduct the
audit even before Board of Trustees
Chairperson John Marous had requested
it last week.

The team of investigators will include
personnel from the auditor general’s legal
department, the state Bureau of Auditors
and the Bureau of Investigations.

According to Hafer. the investigation
will last several months, although the
exact scope of the review won’t be
determined until next week, when Hafer’s
team meets with Pitt representatives.

Lincoln and Temple universities will
also be included in the budget studiés.
Penn State is exempt by law from this
type of audit.

Pitt is audited annually by Hafer’s office,
but that study only includes state funding.
The yearly audit determines if the university
is spending taxpayers’ money
appropriately. ’

“This is something completely different
from the normal audit,” I-Iafer said. \

If this review reveals any wrongdoing,
Hafer said that the information would be
turned over to the proper authorities.

I-lafer’s office has set up a toll-free
number for anyone with information about
Pitt spending practices. Calls can be made
to 1-800-922-8477. '

The audit was prompted partly because
of the outrage surrounding retiring Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s controversial

$3.3 million retirement package.

On Monday, Pitt’s Senate Council ‘A 
recommended to the full University Senate  -'‘‘'”=

that Posvar’s $201,000 retirement salary be r z 

cut in half.

It was also suggested that the executive

committee of the board of trustees resign.

Board Chairperson john Marous said at as ’

press conference Monday that the board
was unaware of Posvar’s full retirement

package until it was disclosed in the 

media.
“ I-l ow could the trustees be so indifferent?
Shouldn’t there have been some natural

curiosity?” saidlrwin Schulman, a political _ .
science professor and member of the "

Senate Council.

Sunshine

by the law.

But charges raised under the

Open Meeting Law, better known
as the Sunshine Act, must be ﬁled
within 30 days after a suspected
violation is discovered or within
30 days after an open meeting.
Charges can not be filed more
than one year after an alleged
violation occurs.

Since most of the committee’s
decisions concerning Posvar’s
retirement package were made
before 1987, the Sunshine Act

does not apply, _Popper said.
Posvar’s retirement package was
created in 1974.

If the Board of Trustees is found
guilty of violatin g the act, Posvar’s
retirement settlement can be
considered invalid and each
trustee could be fined $100.

Pitt retained a law firm outside
the university to maintain
objectivity while helping the
trustees decide what to do about
Posvar’s retirement package,
according to Popper.

“The Board of Trustees asked
me whatthe legal options were

. It is a rather sophisticated
inquiry, and I wanted some help,”

Popper said. “I wanted to have’

someone look at this who is not
connected with anygof the trustees

‘or the president  to get a fresh

objective. This areaof law is very
abstruse.”

.— Popper would not reveal the
name of the legal firm hired to
advise the trustees.

“I don’t think [the firm] should
be talking about their private
legal [business] with anyone but
their client,” Popper said.

According to Popper, the full
board of trustees did not discuss
Posvar’s retirement until two or
three weeks ago. “It wasn’t until
[Posvar] was approaching
retirement that the board sat back
and said, ‘Let's arrange your
departure in an orderly way.”’

“lMarous] now wishes the board
had been more aware. He didn’t
see it as a necessity” to investigate
Posvar’s retirement settlement,
Popper said. “They just assumed
it was there and it was going to
take care of‘ his retirement, so
why look into it?”

The new compensation
committee will include the
chairperson of the board of
trustees, the = two vice‘-
chairpersons and the chairperson

Economy down, internships up

By Lisa Restivo
For T be Pitt News

The downturn in the economy doesn’t mean a
decrease in the number of available internships,
said Richard Wood, coordinator of internships at
the University of Pittsburgh. According to Wood,
a company that can’t afford to pay a full-time
employee might be even more willing to take on
interns.

But there are not many paid internships, Wood
said. Students who need to be paid for their work
can find a job that could be used as an internship.

Pitt student Edith Wilson works in a law firm,
recruiting physicians and scheduling them for
professional seminars and workshops, said Wood.
According to Wood, Wilson’s supervisor
suggested that she use the job as an internship.

Patricia Carr, assistant to the director of
placement at Pitt, said, “Internships are a good
way foremployers to scout for talent. Internships
don’t guarantee a job, but they can be a real
important stepping stone in one’s career.”
According to Carr, internships give employers a
sneak preview of how well a student will be on
a job.

“For example, if a student is doing quality
work while in the internship at a television
station, why would the station go outside to hire

for a position?” said Carr. If a position becomes
available during this time, the intern could have
the first chance at the job, said Carr.

Jeff Holst, director of human resources at
Mobay Corporation, said 80 percent of interns
are hired when the corporation is satisfied with
the intern and a position is available when the
internship is completed. “We look at an internship
as an extended employment interview on both
sides,” said Holst.

Adam Kanter, a recent political science graduate
at Pitt, did two internships. According to Kanter,
some internships are clerical, while others are
flexible and provide a greater opportunity to
learn different things. Kanter said that in his first
internship, he worked in Sen. Arlen Specter’s
office answering phones and addressing
complaints from people in the district.

‘‘I was not allowed to deal directly with federal
agencies, to do the real work in the office, until
near the end of my internship,” said Kanter.

-While at his second internship, at Prudential

Securities, he started as an aide to a broker.
Because he enjoyed the experience, Kanter said
that he increased the hours of his internship and
was eventually offered a job at Prudential. “If you

’are conscious of what you want to learn,

[internships] can be a good learning experience,”

Sari/eyﬂnds increase in student drinking and driving, ,

By Catherine Goldstein
For The Pitt News

Of 1,000 Pitt students, 440 stopped
drinking long enough to respond to a
drug and alcohol survey conducted by the
Student Health Service in February.

According to Shirley Haberman, health-
education administrator, the results ofthe
survey will be used to expand substance-
abuse programs. Haberman is in charge of
analyzing the survey.

“With these surveys, we can see what
the current trends of usage are among
students. Then we can decide what
programs we design would be
appropriate,” Haberman said. A similar

survey was conducted in 1989.

The only change found between the
surveys conducted in 1989 and 1991 was
a significant increase in drinking and
driving.

In 1989, 25 percent of the students
reported that they drove while under the
influence of alcohol.

In 1991, 38 percent admitted to driving
under the inﬂuence.

Out of 19,000 Pitt undergraduates, 1,000
randomly chosen students received the
survey, and 440 responded. Surveys were
mailed to the students’ homes. According
to Haberman, this was an adequate
representation of the alcohol and drug
usage on the Pitt campus.

“From the results of the survey, it is
clearly evident that alcohol remains the
no. 1 drug of choice, and the students
have a problem with usage of it,” said
Haberman.

For example, 42 percent of students
drink more than they had originally
intended; 21 percent have blackouts, and
25 percent have had unintended sexual
encounters while under the influence of
alcohol."

“This has something to say about safe
sex and contraception,” said Haberman.

Although the survey deals with alcohol
and drug use, “the majority of students
responding were using alcohol,” said
Haberman.

7

With the exception of occasional

marijuana use, little drug use was reported,
Haberman said. ,

Students from other schools responded
to similar surveys, and according to
Haberman, “Pitt seems to experience less
problems dealing with alcohol and drugs
as compared to other schools.”

The precise results of the survey have
notyet been publicized because Haberman
is not finished analyzing them. The next
survey will tentatively be conducted in
1992 or 1993.

The Student Health Service received a
$115,000 federal grant for the survey.
Surveyssimilarto this one willbe circulated
over a two-year period.

responsibility of faculty is to
teach,” and he said he sees “no
dichotomy between teaching and
research, which feed off of each
other.”

Professor Windt, along with
about 6,000 other nominees, has
recently been nominated for the
Speech Communication
Association’s upcoming National
Outstanding Teaching Award in

A November.

Windt said his wife, Beth Ingole,
“makes time for me to write. She
also co—edited Essays in Political
Rhetoric with me and is co-
authoring a book on rhetoric of
the‘1970s with me.”

It’s surprising that Windt finds
time to write because he’s a

scholar in demand. Halfway
through the interview, Burt
Sullivan at the National journal
phoned, wanting to consult
Windt about what the change in
speech writers at the White House
will mean for the speeches
planned for the-1992 presidential
campaign.

Windt heads for the garden or
the golf course in his spare time
and admits with a chuckle, “I
watch much too much
television.”

Windt is a 1985 winner of the
University of Pittsburgh

.President’s Distinguished
Teaching Award and has recently
won the Everett Lee Hunt
Scholarship Award, which is
presented annually for works of

distinguished, humanistic
scholarship.

Windt won the award for his
1990 books, Rhetoric as a
Human Adventure and
Presidents and Pmtestors. V

Windt describes Presidents and
Protestors as being “about people
making choices, the kind of
choices that were made in the
1960s. ” Presidents and Protesters
is the first of six volumes dealing
with political rhetoric that Windt
plans to complete within the next
several years, one of which is eo—
authored with Lynn Hinds (“that’s
a male,” Windt adds, grinning)
and another which is co—authored
with Ingole. The volumes critically
appraise political rhetoric from
1945 to 1995.

Shange opens Pittsburgh 'sfirstBlack Writers Conference

By Rebecca Wilkins
Staﬂ" Writer

Playwright Ntozake Shange, keynote
speaker at the Black Writers Conference
last week, presented a piece of performance
art in six different languages that involved
her experience as a black female writer,
her theories about language and a story
about a mother and child.

“As a woman of color who speaks for
this hemisphere, 1 function as the exotic —
the other,” said Shange, a playwright, poet
and novelist.

“How can I, who does not exist except

Journalists share tips

as a transition for white people to transcend,
find a language or an image that actualizes
our reality as both conscious and
unconscious without being exploiting or
being exploited?”

Shange is well—known for her play For
Colored Girls Who Have Considered
Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf

Her performance was titled “Whispers
Inside Black Holes" or “Time Reduction of
the Star Gazers."

Shange stressed the strength and
importance of the usage of African
languages.

“African languages have refused to die,”

she said. “They will not simply go the way

of Latin and become fossils for linguistic
archaeologists to dig up.”
Shange said she supports the use of

African languages by black writers, even if

their first language is English.

“Using African tongues in written
literature is a major front in our struggle for
cultural and political aggression,” she said.

“We African writers are bound in our
calling to do for our languages what

Spenser, Milton and Shakespeare did for

English, what Pushkin and Tolstoy did for
Russian, indeed what all writers in all

world history have done for their languages,

by meeting the challenge of creating a
literature in them, which process greater
opens the languages for philosophy,
science, technology and all other areas of

Shange suggested that when people
must use a language which is not their
own, racial discrimination and stereotypes
may occur.

“The imposed language, in our case
English, appropriates all life elsewhere as
not belonging in any way whatsoever to
us — hence the alleged difficulty colored
people have with technology,” Shange
said.

African-Americans who plan to
enter the field of journalism
should be tough and confident,
said Carmen Lee, a staffwriter for
The Pittsburgh Post—Gazette. Lee
was a panelist at a Pittsburgh
Black Writers Conference
workshop on blacks in journalism.

“To get into this business you ’ve
got to scheme. You can’t just sit
back waiting for an opportunity
 Take anything you can get
your hands on,” said Post-
Gazette feature writer Tony
Norman.

The panelists said few black
writers in Pittsburgh take
advantage of free-lance
opportunities. Norman said that
the Post—Gazetteof ten has to “send
out white stringers to do work in
the black community.”

Norman, who started out as a
news clerk, recommended free-
lance writing as the best way to

earn experience.

Black writers are still
discriminated against, according
to Lee. “Being an African-
American makes the job more
challenging because you are in a
position where you have to be
better to be considered equal,”
she said.

Lee said free-lance writers and
full-ti me reporters must pay close
attention to deadlines. She said
the reporter is always “under stress
to write a lot of stories in a short
amount of time.”

Tom Erwin, who said he does
not work well under deadlines,
opted for a career as a news
editor. Erwin, who works for The

Washington Post, said his job is
to “judge all aspects of the story.”

Erwin said he always tries to
show compassion when he is
editing. “Respect the story, the
writer and the effort, but don’t be
a wimp. It is left to the news
editor,” said Erwin, “to challenge
a story’s logic, accuracy and
objectivity.”

Telling a story is like making love, said
Temujin the Storyteller. “You can’t do it
the same way twice. You might do it
better, but it will never be exactly the
same.”

Temujin, a Pittsburgh native, was one of
three panelists in a “Fiction and Folktales”
workshop at the first Pittsburgh Black
Writers Conference. Authors Carol Dixon
and John A. Williams also participated in
the workshop Sunday.

“Don’t let the printed word frighten

something, you experience it. Nobody
can feel it the way you do  When you
read, understand that whoever wrote it
filtered it through his experience.”
According to Williams, a professor of
English and journalism at Rutgers
University, “The books we need to
accomplish the teaching of our culture are
not available  We do not know African
myths. African—Americans have not had
their folktales as widely dispersed,”
suggesting that the many small, black
publishing companies in America merge
into one national black publishing house.
Williams also said African—Americans

regard to African mythology and folktales.

example, claiming that a Zairian version
preceded the well—known Greek version.

Dixon, the 1986 recipient of the Black
Writer Achiever of the Year Award, talked
of the many evils facing African-American
society today, such as drug addiction,
AIDS and the high death rate of black
males. Yet she called herself “an optimist
writer.”

Quoting the author John Oliver Killens,
she said, “Every time I sit down at my

Prof says black literature misinterpreted

African—Americans are taught
in school to despise their African
roots, according to Molefi Asante.

Asante, who heads the
department of African-American
studies at Temple University, and
Joyce A. Joyce. spoke at a
workshop on black literary
criticism at the Black Writers
Conference at Pitt last weekend.

"Africans and African-
Americans are dominated by
Europeans, and their thought in
political and social arenas is
undermined,” said Joyce, who
teaches ethnic studies and English
at the University of Nebraska.

Asante blamed ignorance of

African and African-American
culture for the misinterpretation
of black literature. According to
Asante, this ignorance affects both
blacks and whites. ,

‘‘I asked five African-American
students to name African ethnic
groups. They couldn’t, but all of
them named at least 10 European
ethnic groups,” Asante said.

Black writers are often
misunderstood or misinterpreted
because the European
perspective taught in American
schools “promotes itself as
universal.” As a result, “African-
Americans are dislocated because
they assume this perspective” is
the only one.

Joyce said African—Americans
are simply “not included in
European intellectual thought.”

There is a need for
Afrocentricity, which “is not the
black version of Eurocentricity,"

Asante said. Rather, Afrocentricity '

includes a plurality of cultures
without judging them.

The acceptance and critique of
black literature in the West is
currently being debated. A variety
of arguments have been leveled
against the inclusion of black
literature in the Western literary
canon. Early opponents said that
African-American art did not exist.
They later admitted that black art
did exist but was inferior.

The latest argument, which
Asante and Joyce addressed, is

that African-American literature

is not an art; rather, it is a rough
draft requiring Eurocentric craft
to mold it into art.

Dixon said that writing in the 21st century

should be “a go g back in order to move
forward  We need only to look and see
what is going on in our communities to
 There is
nothing wrong with returning to the old
when the new is not functioning properly.”

“The role of fiction is to make the reader
think and feel and to act on those thoughts
and feelings,” she said. “This is called
‘revolution.”’ .

Some members of the audience
expressed concern about white society
stealing from black culture. “Our culture
won’t be ours 209 or 300 years from now.
It will be somebody else’s,” one audience
member commented.

“Writing is a process. It's not just something that you begin
and you put it all out there, and it’s finished. My greatest piece
of advice is to do your very best no matter how long the
process takes,” Brown said. “For non-fiction, you have to be
concerned with your presentation. You have to have a
proposal. For fiction you just have to write it and re~write and

rewrite it."

‘Brown also suggested doing research on the publishing
business. “There are publications that give information on
who is publishing fiction, non—ﬁction topics, poetry or how_
you can get grants."

Cole gave similar advice to magazine writers. “Know about
your readership. Who is the reader? What is the circulation? Is
it local, national, international, regional? Which suits your idea?
Do you know that there is a publication that will be interested
in your perspective? Present your article in an interesting
enough manner where your reader will be interested.”

Campus crime cover-ups...

The statistics are staggering — the crime is one of
violation. The victims are angry, and most campuses are
turning their heads to avoid conflict.

We’re speaking of campus rape. Although the University
of Pittsburgh has many services to help rape victims, there
are many other universities, such as Carleton College and
William and Mary, that tend to ignore victims for the sake
the school’s reputation.

When one student was raped at William and Mary, a
dean took her to the campus police, but steered her away
from the outside authorities. After an internal investigation
was requested by the victim, she had to face her attacker
for seven-and-a-half hours of grueling questioning. He
was found guilty of sexual assault. His penalty? Barred
from entering any dorm or fraternity on campus other
than his own for four years-but was also allowed to stay
in school.

We are lucky enough to attend a university so close to
a city where organizations such as Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape exist. On most_ rural campuses, the nearest
facilities for rape victims are located on campus and are
run by the universities. This situation proves to be unfair
when counselors deter the victims from reporting the
incident to the proper authorities. - vi

Universities tend to be more concerned with their images
than they are with helping students. Carleton College in
Minnesota is being sued byfour young women who were
victims of acquaintance rape. These women claim that the
school knew that the men who raped them had had a
history of sexual abuse, yet did nothing to prevent those
men from assaulting again. ‘ —

After one girl was raped by a man she didn’t know, he
proudly told her’ his name. As it turns out, his was at the
top of the “castration list” females had scrawled in university
bathrooms to warn others. V V

The “castration list” concept began at Brown University
by women who were raped, yet silenced by the school. In
this day and age when sexual assault is so frequent, it is
alarming that women must resort to writing on walls
about others to get their desperate messages heard.

It is time for administrators to see that although a rape
may hurt their particular campus’s image, rape occurs
everywhere.

It is not a matter of how a woman is dressed or how she
acts or if she ﬂirts with a man. It can happen in a dorm
room, at a party, in an alley, or in a stairwell.

It is almost inevitable that one in six women will be a
victim of sexual assault while in college. It doesn’t matter
where it happens. What matters is that awareness and
prevention are a priority —— and most colleges aren’t
giving victims the attention and support they need.

S Rust VS. Sullivan:

On May 23, 1991, the Constitution was gang
raped. Justices Rehnquist, Souter, White, Scalia and
Kennedy stripped the great document bare and
violated it in several different amendments.

On that date, the United States Supreme Court
upheld government censorship in federally funded
farr1ily- planning programs. The Court’s decision in

(10) funding for

family-planning services began in 1970. Congress
authorized Title X programs to provide
comprehensive information and services to health-
care provider’s clients. Since that time, the funding
did not pay for abortions; it was solely for
reproductive health—care counseling which may
happen to include the discussion of abortion. Until
1988, doctors would referwomen seeking abortions
to the appropriate clinic.

That’s when President Reagan attempted to
persuade Congress to restrict Title X funding from
programs that even mention the word “abortion.”
Congress said “no,” and Reagan imposed the "gag
rule" through the Health and Human Services without
Congressional approval. Even more absurd, the
Reagan/ Bush “gag rule” restrains Title X programs
to operate in the same facilities where abortions are
performed or discussed; abortion talk can’t even be
in the next room or at the other end of the hall of a
Title X clinic. For three years, the “gag rule” was
held up in the court. Suits were filed against the “gag
rule" by Planned Parenthood, other Title X clinics,
New York State, New York City and the New York
Health and Hospitals Corporation as well as
individuals including Dr. Irving Rust.

Dr. Rust is ' an obstetrician/gynecologist with
Planned Parenthood in the South Bronx. Living as a
medical intern in Harlem during the '60s, Rust
watched women die from botched illegal abortions.
Prior to 1973, abortion was a crime in many states.

impose conditions for funding ‘in violation of the
Constitution. However in Rust, the gag rule is such
a violation. If funding is allocated for reproductive

Contradicting the First Amendment in Rust, the
Court denies doctors and even patients the same"
free speech protection in the Title Xgovernment
program. The “gag rule”— prevents health—care
workers from discussing abortion even if a client
brings up the subject. Doctors are expected to say
nothing. Even more chilling, the Reagan/ Bush “gag
rule” is lifted if doctors discourage abortion. Now
the» Bush administration is acting like the “thought
police” and mandating that his beliefs on abortion
become the only speech allowed in “his” federally-
supported clinics. Title X supported clinics benefit
women most unlikely to receive the expensive health

"care in _the private sector. Demonstrating its
indifference to the fact that low-income women I

might not receive the health care that Congress
mandated under Title X, the five constitutional rapists
quipped: lt’s not the government's restrictions, but
the woman’s fault that she is poor and not able to
enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected
freedom of choice. As in many rapes, women are
blamed; apparently, these five justices concur.

We're living in hell—we’re entering the dark ages
where we have to watch a rape and not be allowed
to do anything about it. This decision is not about
whether abortion is right or wrong.It's about our
government promoting ignoranceand denying
women their rights It’s about the right to information,
to complete medical advice, no matter how much
money you have.

lt’s about a people in government who wish to
promote their point of view regardless of the rights
they stomp on. Abortion is not illegal in this country
yet, but King George and his court feel that the poor,
dumb masses should not be privy to information
that he gets from his private doctor.

You’ve seen the commercial: “You have
to have experience to get experience.”
Well, let” me tell ye, it’s the same all over.

Take the Shakespeare Festival, for
instance. Say you’re a drama student. You
come to college to get an education (ie.
as much experience as you can lay your
hands on), but when summer rolls around
and the Shakespeare Festival with it, you
discover that all the big roles go to the big
players —— the pros. You're left with a
walk-on —— and that’s if you’re lucky.

But wait 

Before you dial the Columbia School of
Theatre Arts, there ’s something you should
know. The Young Company.

It started last year as “the idea of a group
of Ph.D. and MFA students who wanted
the opportunity to direct and act in large
roles in Shakespeare,” according to Jay
Scott Chipman, a Pitt Ph.D. theater student
who was in on the ground-level
organization of the company.

The Young Company is run entirely by
students to give them opportunities and
experience that they wouldn’t otherwise
receive.

The Company premiered with an all- _
student production of TheMer'ry Wives of
Windsor as part of last season’s
Shakespeare Festival.

Both‘Merry Wives and the upcoming
Cymbeline were directed. by Chipman
and chosen’ because of their relative
obscurity. .

“We wanted to take plays that weren’t
done as often,” he said. "Cymbelineis such
an exciting script, and it’s like something
new, because it’s rarely ever done. It puts
us in a position of introducing it to our
audience.”

Chipman feels that with a mixture of

history and comedy, Cymbeline is a,play
full of wonderful challenges.

“It’s even got a war in the middle, so
there’s the challenge of ‘OK, now how do
you stage the war? How do you present

 the love story? And the dream sequence?”’

he said.

The play revolves around Posthumous
and Imogen and the test their love
undergoes during the course of the play.

Posthumous enters into a wager with an
evil villain who tests Imogen’s virtue.

“Of course Imogen will not submit,.but

'British Anirnation Invasion’ at the Playhouse

By Paul E. Zeidman
For The Pitt News

Of all the works presented in
The British Animation Invasion,
several stand out so you think of
them after the- lights come up.
The best is “Creature Comforts,”
the‘ most recent winner of the
Academy Award for Best
Animated Short. It is presented
as a sort of man-on-the—street
interview with a twist. The
interviewees are the animals that
reside in a zoo, and they are
describing how they feel about
living in the zoo. They speak
their minds into a microphone
held by a human hand (but that’s
the only human anatomy we

v see).

Other great works inclu de Peter
Gabriel’s “Sledgehammer” video,
a piece titled “Dolphins” that is a
sort of stop-motion sketching
(not to be’ confused with

Claymation, which also makes

up a good percentage of the
whole series) set to relaxing
music, and a seven—minute short
titled “Body Beautiful” which is
about one woman’s revenge on
an over—inllated male ego. It
also includes the classic line,
“And that’s discipline, which
starts with D, which rhymes
with E, which stands for Elvis!”
spoken in a voice similar to that
of Sean Connery in “The
Untouchables.”

Many of the shorts in the film
are commercials, and they range
from a pitch for backpacks in
French to a spoof of the song
“leader ofthe Pack” for a Danish
butterspread, to a very authentic-
looking “Tom andjerry” cartoon
that revolves around British
Tu pperware.

The only bad thing about The
British Animation Invasion is
that it is occasionally too hard to
understand their British accents.

No use in beating around the

Republicans hate it anyway.
What’s going on? Raw punk
energy and drive, turbo charged
with beefy power chords and
served up with a shaken pop feel
— and the show has only just
begun.

In fact, it’s only the opening
act, Jawbox. Hailing from our
nation’s capital and home of filth

- that has spurred such beauties as
the Dischord record label, for
which Jawbox has just completed

she did,” he said.

Chipman speculates that the
play Calls for a cast of about 50.
This is a lS—member cast with a
lot of role swaps and quick
changes back stage. -

Aside from the main characters,
an ensemble of seven women
are filling in the rest of the cast.

As part ofChipman’s vision for
the play, the women is always on
stage to guide Imogen in her
trials throughout the play.

The production help Chipman
receives is also from students.

“’Ihat’s what’s so exciting about
this — that we actually can do
this,” _ he said. ~“Our own
production company — just the
experience of doing it.”

None of the company’s
excitement is lost on the audience.
Their performances are raw and

uninhibited— a great compliment
to the festival's glossy mainstage
productions.

Chipman feels that part of this
energy is due to the type ofactor/
director relationship being used.

Chi pman believes that the small
space at The Pit (formerly City
Theatre) also adds to the intensity
level. With Cymbeline, he plans
to make full use of the entrances
and exits, allowing the actors to

come in close contact with the
audience.

“It’s more fun for the audience
because they’re not passive
listeners; they’re laughing and
responding. I think that just
charges up an actor,” he said.

Cymbeline will run from June
2] through july .73, and if past
Young Company performances

are any indication, it will be well- '

worth checking out.

Prospects long on talent, strength

By Brian Berger

and Derek Willis
T be Pill News

Who needs a big man? In these
days of lightning-quick guards

"with the flying ability of a

functioning stealth bomber and

?the arsenal and payload capacity

to boot, who needs an overgrown

. behemoth to create traflic?In these

times of 6-foot~9 forwards who
jump to the moon and dunk

cheese in the planet's holes, who

needs a mass ofweight and girth

to block these astronauts’ flight

plans? Well, at last look, at least
14 National Basketball Association
teams were in dire need of a wide
body in the lane. ‘

So much for that theory.
Basketball is still a game of size
and strength and intimidation.
Who better to complete this
package than a 7éfoot mobile
robot waiting for instructions of
destruction? Somehow these
military ahalogies all tie together
because the best player in the
nation (outside the NBA) decided

that hismilita ry pops knew best. ~

The “luv shack,” Shaquille O’
Neal, will remain at Louisiana State
for his junior season and will leave
NBA general managers drooling
like Pavlov’s dogs for another
season as the 7-foot man-‘child
destroys all in sight.

So, O’Neal is staying put --
who’s left? Here’s a ranking of the
top centers eligible for this year’s
draft to be heldJune 26.

Centers: ,

1.. Dikembe Mutombo (7-2,

Certain writers for local papers
will not let us enjoy the Penguins
Stanley Cup title, while others
speak as if the other major-league
baseball teams may as well just
give up because the Pirates will
roll to a World Series victory. And
nobody is talking about the
Steelers and the impending, yet
predictable,’ holdout of top-pick
Huey Richardson. Will 'lbe Pitt
News provide a small glimpse of
sensible sports journalism? Nope,
just Brady again. That's it, get all
the groaning out of your system at
the beginning of the article.

The problem with the Pens is
that the champs may be
dismantled due to financial
constraints. The team looks like a
group just getting started, with
Kevin Stevens and Mark Recchi
establishing themselves among
the top players in the league and
most hockey experts touting
JaromirJagr as a future superstar.
(Speaking of Jagr, you would
think it might be nice if he learned
to put the puck in the net once in
a while. He is as fun to watch as
Mario Lemieux now, but it might
be nice if he would get the basics
down a little better.) Lemieux is
now far from a one-man team.

Unfortunately, Recchi, Stevens,
Ron Francis, Gordie Roberts,

Georgetown‘ University).
Foreigner has developed faster
and better than his counterpart at
CU, Alonzo Mourning. Incredible
shotblocker and defender who
runs the floor gracefully for a man
his size. Offensive skills are
continuing to’ improve
(developed a decent hook, and
he’s got a nice touch from the
free-throw line). Will be a major
factor in the NBA. Wouldn't be a
surprise if he were drafted with
the first pick.

2. Stanley Roberts (7-0, played
in Spain, ex—Louisiana State
University). A huge bruiser who
is gifted with soft hands and agile
feet. Has tremendous touch
around the hoop and can be

- explosive and dominating when

he wants to be. Word has it that
he’s determined and primed for
the NBA. Has to keep weight

down. Either a phenomvor abust,

all the talent is there. ..

3. Rich King (742, University of
Nebraska). A real, mobile big man
with a sweet touch, who has been
earning praise from the scouts
because of his size/agility factor.

"Not very physical or dominant

and will need time to develop.
4. Luc Longley (7-2, University
of New Mexico). Luc ‘has been
earning praise for quite a while
but has never earned respect
because of his poor tournament

-and camp play. Tremendous

shooting touch and the best
passing ability of any big man
available. Has been ranked as
highas No. 3 overall in some
publications because of his

Bryan Trottier and Scott Young
are free agents. All made key
contributions at times, and any
loss from the team will hurt,
especially if it's one of the first
three. The impending sale of the

team could delay the signings, '

and a new owner may think of
cutting costs by letting one or
more players go. If the Debartalos

' hold on to the team, there should
“be no problem since EddieJr. just
gave /i9er backup QB Steve 6

Young over four million per year,

and that would be plenty to sign '

the Pens’ free agents.

Those who want to trade Paul
Coffey and his big contract to cut
costs since he contributed little in
the playoffs seem to forget that he
was a major contributor in the
regular season and that his
absence was the main reason for
the Penguins’ problems on the
power play in the playoffs.

-As for the Pirates, a recent
column in a local paper gushed
about the Pirates like a little girl
about her first crush. Hey, the
Mets are not deadyet; neither are
the Cardinals, believe it or not.

‘Most people seem to think that

with the high—priced Cubs
struggling (in large part due to the
loss of ace starter Mike Harkey),
nobody can stop the Bucs.

diversity. Poor shot selection at
times. Has the talent— needs the
confidence.

5. Chad Gallagher (6-10, 1 .
Chreighton University). From the - 

same school that gave us super
bust headcase Benoit Benjamin.
A load in the paint who scores
with efficiency and is a presence.

Defense is solid, and he hits the 

boards hard. A fearless banger

-who lacks tremendous talent but
has a big frame and knows how to .

use it.

6. Shaun Vandiver (6-10,
University of Colorado). A big-
time scorer in the Big Eight who
owns a great shot and big gut.
Best shooter of the bunch who
can hit from inside and outside.
Not very agile because of a knee
injury that should hurt his chances
of playing power forward. Can’t
play defense but will outscore his
opponent on the other end.

7. George Ackles (6-10,
University of Nevada at Las
Vegas). Great athlete and jumper
who dunks like a lunatic. Excellent
defensively and on the boards
although his offensive game has
never been ‘seen because of the
tremendous talent that swam in
the Tark Ocean around him. Will
never be a great scorer, but he
could make his presence felt.

8. Victor Alexander (6-9, Iowa
State University). A true wide body
who likes to eat. A gifted scorer‘
who leans his frame on his
opponents. Excellent inside
moves and touch. Great
rebounder for his size. Could play

See Center, page 13 ‘

Ryan
Buncher

This team does have problems.
Doug Drabek seems to have
righted himself, but he is not back
to 1990 form where the Bucs need
him. Zane Smith and Randy
Tomlin have both been hit hard in
their last two starts, and just how
many innings are left in Bob
Walk’s aging arm and twinging
hamstring? Barry Bonds may have
come around, butAndy Van Slyke
hasn’t. Many writers seem to be a
bit too enthralled with a bullpen
that, with the exception of closer
Bill Landrum, has been erratic.
This includes Stan Belinda, who
despite the fact that everyone
raves about how nasty his stuff is,
really isn ‘t that effective.

Tom1in’s struggles would be of
more concern, but maybe it -has

something to do with the fact that _

Jim Leyland keeps skipping him
in the rotation. He may be the fifth
starter, but he is also the pitcher
who would be most detrimentally
affected by missing starts.
Leyland’s answer that he can't skip
Drabek, Smith or John Smiley is

valid, but what about Walk? He
hasn’t really been any more
productive than Tomlin and is far
more useful when available for
bullpen work. .

On other matters, where, oh
where, have you gone, Gary
Varsho? The acquisition of Mitch
Webster has reduced him from
key reserve to nonexistent. What

happened to Leyland getting at— ‘

bats for his bench? Not thatl really
care, but I like to pick on Leyland
once in a while, even for minor
things, just because none of the
other local sportswriters seem
willing to do it. More to an
important point, why do the Bucs
seem so interested in acquiring
former Cubs? They have four in
Varsho, Webster, Curtis Wilkerson
and Lloyd McClendon. Since when
does involvement with the
Cubbies teach one anything about
winning? Well, at least they are
just backups.

Another “at least” that helps this
team is that they can focus on the
present because the future is too
ugly to look at. As free—agent losses
due to money problems, cheap
owners, or the fact that some
people will never learn to like this
town, continue to loom over the
team like graduation looms over
college students who just aren't

   Trouble may be brewing with Pittsburgh sports

ready for re'al life (Sorry, I’m just
trying to find something good
about being a sophomore), the
powers that be in baseball are no
help. First, the Pirates had to pay
$7 million in collusion damages
with more penalties to come, even
though the team doesn’tsign high-
priced free agents —— even when
there is no collusion. Now,
Commissioner Fay Vincent has
decided to give part of the $190
million in expansion fees to the
American League, taking much-
needed funds away from the
Pirates. National League teams
may join me now in my favorite
sports chant, “Nuts and bolts, nuts
and bolts, we got screwed.”
°Steeler fans should be
encouraged to know that ﬁ_rst—

round draft pick Huey Richardson '

has an agent, but it is last year’s
f irst-round selection Eric Green’s
agent. Actually, it probably
doesn't matter; the Steelers will

find a way to have their top pick

come in late no matter what.

Even though pure free agency /’

(only in sports can purity and
greed go together) still has no
place in the NFL, they are
determined to let that old
Pittsburgh style (lack of money,
cheap owners, etc.) screw them

up.

This year’s draft conjures up past tragedy

Sports Illustrated called it the
“Death of a Dream.”

It seems so long ago, and yet it
was just about five years ago. Well,
actually, for me five years is a
long time ago. I was 16 years old,
a junior in high school and living
in Maryland. He had ﬁnished his
senior season and was
undoubtedly one of the best
college basketball players in the
country and headed for the NBA
draft.

He was the heart and soul of
what was basically a pretty bad
Division I basketball team.
Standing 6-foot—8, he looked and
performed like the ultimate
basketball player. It was said that
once he went pro, he would
redefine the small forward
position the way Michael Jordan
did at shooting guard.

Iionly got to see him play in
person once. I don’t remember
who his team was playing, or
even what month or year the game
was played in. All I remember,
vaguely, is.him. »

Iremember his standing outon
the floor, tall and muscular. He
drew double and triple coverage
from opponents, but that didn’t
stop him. He was quick and agile,
yet strong. He could dribble, and
he could drive to the basket. He

also’ was ‘a powerful rebounder , .

and inside scorer.

But his favorite shot, his
patented move, was a baseline
jumper. Likejordan when he soars
in the air or Magic on the fastbreak,

from the baseline he was a sure_2
points. Every game I saw,
especially that one time I saw him
in person, I watched for it. He
would break to the baseline, either
off a pick waiting for a pass or
driving on his own, his hands
would go up, the ball would rise
softly in the air, spinning slowly,
and the net would swish softly.
Onjune 17, 1986, just five years
and five days from now, he was
the second pick overall, drafted
by the Boston Celtics. He couldn’t

have gone into a better situation. ‘

Larry Bird so looked forward to
playing with him that he said he
would attend rookie camp if the
Celtics drafted him. He was a man
on top of the world.
Can you remember his name?

' If you cannot, there is one way
to remind you, or explain_why
you don’t know: Two days after
the draft, he died from a
cardiorespiratory arrest caused by
the use of cocaine.

There is no evidence that he
had ever taken cocaine before.
That one time was enough.

‘ (Call Todayl).

When I first heard of his death,
after the initial shock and disbelief,
I was angry. I felt, selfishly, that
he had taken something away
from me, that he had cheated me.
Who was he to take such risks
with his body? What — was he a
complete fool to do such a thing?
I stomped around my room,
throwing books, pencils and

clothes in anger. How dare he cut ‘

his own life short. Why would he
do such a thing? -

It is amazing to look back and
remember the loss I felt, a loss I
still feel from time to time. The
anger is gone, five years later,
replaced by regret and sadness,
for him, his family and myself. I
am no saint, and I realized a lot of
the feelings I still experience are
selfish. I never knew him or really
what kind of person he was,
except what little bits he let the
media see. I don’t know why he
took cocaine that night, and even
though I wanted to know then,
five years later, I realize: 1) It’s
none of my business, and 2) it
doesn’t really matter. He was the

only one cheated of anything.
At the time, so many people
‘were hit hard by his death. Now,
he is nearly forgotten, passed over
by the Kenny Andersons, the Larry
Johnsons and Billy Owens ofthe
world who are the new stars of
this year's draft. Now all that
remains is a story of wasted
potential. But I will still remember.
I su ppose that if there ever were
a strong case against using
cocaine, his would be the one.
Butl find it difficult to think that
all that is left of his legacy is a
shallow, negative example of
what happens when you do drugs.
Drugs did take away his dream.
Yet even after five years, after 15
or maybe even after 50, I will
think about the way he played
basketball. I can see him inmy
mind’s eye, taking, that baseline
jumper, and I sigh. 'I‘h::t’s all I
have left, those fading memories.

The ideal computer for college needs certain things. Like a student price and- affordable loan payments. And on a

mouse, to make it easy to use. Preloaded software, that’ll let
you create impressive papers with graphics and spread-
sheets. _And great tools, like a notepad, calendar and
cardﬁle. It should also be expandable, so it can grow with
your needs. '

The IBM Personal System/2® has all this at a special
