Buell Names

Owl Drive

Robert Buell, C, business man-
ager of the Owl, announced this
week the opening of a new drive
"by the Pitt yearbook for adver-
tising contracts. There are a num-

I ber of positions on the advertis-

ing staff which are as yet unﬁlled.
These positions consist primarily
of selling advertising space in the
Owl to national, as well as local,
-corporations. Commissions are
paid on each contract obtained.
James Johns, ‘BusAd, adver-
tising manager of the Owl, states
that his staff did a ﬁne job last

1 semester, but he emphasized that

mu-ch work is yet to be done. A
number of lucrative contracts
from last year’s Owl have not as
yet been obtained. He further
states that it is vital to the success
of the yearbook that these con-
tracts be obtained as soon as pos-
sible.

Any student who is at all in-
terested in this type of activity
should report to the Owl office at
3:30 o’clock this afternoon. Bob
Buell will interview all applicants
at this time.

Proceeds from Hedda Gabler To Be
Shared with Twelfth Floor Fund

Proceeds from “Hedda Gabler,”
the show Pitt Players will present

on Friday and Saturday, March 9
and 10, will be shared with the
Women’s Twelfth Floor Fund, the
dean of Women’s ofﬁce announced
today.

Tickets will be distributed by
Pan-Hellenic Council, Dodie Hur-
rell, chairman, stated. The ﬁrst
ﬂoor Information room will be
headquarters for ticket distribu-
tion. Price of the tickets is $1
with tax included.

The women students of the Uni-
versity are undertaking to raise
$100,000 to complete and furnish
the twelfth floor. It is their aim
to make this ﬂoor a meeting place
for the hundreds of women at the
University. When completed the
ﬂoor will contain conference
rooms, work room, dressing rooms,
and checkrooms. Plans also call
for a roof deck, a kitchen, a social
room, a drawing room memorial to
the late Thyrsa W. Amos, former
dean of women.

Many Pitt women have pledged
to bring in one hundred dollars
each, and several Women’s frater-
nities have donated to the cause.

The fund drive has made con-

donations have been received by
the dean of women’s office. One
woman writes, “With pleasure I
enclose a check for one thousand
dollars for the Twelfth Floor Fund.
I hope the girls will be successful
in reaching their goal.”

Another woman called recently
to say, “It is one of the nicest
things that has happened around
here for a long time. It will be a
real moralebuilder. I am send-
ing a contribution. Please let me
know if there is any other way in
which I can help.”

Miss Rush, dean of women, com-
mented ‘today, “I am highly
pleased by the progress of the
drive to date.” M

Hendrik Ibsen’s “Hedda Gab-
ler” will be the Pitt Players’ ﬁrst
production since “Tonight at
Eight” presented‘ last semester. It
is a play of the late 1890’s and the
action takes place in Norway.

M en’s Rushing Starts

Tomorrow Morning  

Spring rushing for men’s fraternities will get under way tomor-
row morning at 8:30 o’clock and last until Contact with rushees ends
at 2 o’clock Sunday morning. Nine fraternities are participating in

this shortened rushing schedule. They are:

Delta Tau Delta, Phi Delta

Theta, Phi Epsilon Pi, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa, Pi Kappa Alpha,
Pi Lambda Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Chi.
First rushing events carded by the fraternities will be launched

12 Floor’ Fund
Date Extended

It was announced last Friday,
February 23, ‘after a, meeting of
Senior Court, that the campaign
to solicit funds for the womens’
twelfth ﬂoor has been extended
until the end of March. The for-
mer deadline would have closed
the campaign next week.

‘The Court also wished to stress
the fact that all money collected
in the drive will be invested in
war bonds until after the war.
Only then, in peace—time, will
they consider going ahead with
construction.

To date, six women, four un-
dergraduates and Dean Helen P.
Rush and Miss Betty Teal from
the dean of women’s office, have
attained and ‘passed the $100
mark. They are:

Gertrude Blackwood, $114;
Helen Hadgis, $138; Lucille Mor-
gan, $114; Alice Soﬁs, $110; Miss
Rush, $1,175; Miss Teal, $132.

Kappa Alpha Theta, woman’s
fraternity, has donated $100 to
the drive and has pledged every
one of it’s members to collect -100.

“We are hoping,” said Lucille
Morgan, chief justice of Senior
Court, “that other fraternities and
organizations will follow the ex-
ample that the Thetas have set.
There are ‘many girls whose
names have not been mentioned
but who are well on their way to-
wards the $100 mark. If these girls,
and others, keep up the enthusi-
asm they now display, we can’t

Men’s Debate
Make Plans

Men’s Debating association is
currently making plans for its
participation during the last week
in March in the annual parliamen-
tary sessions conducted on the
Penn State campus. Over 15
schools in Pennsylvania are ex-
pected to send delegates to these
assemblies, where the subject for
deliberation may be either com-
pulsory arbitration of all labor
disputes of military service for
youth.

These assemblies follow the tra-
ditional procedures of parliamen-
tary. bodies, and each -school is
asked to prepare a bill on the
subject selected. Various commit-
tees are established in which dif-
ferent bills meet consideration
and a compromise bill is,arrived

upon. T-he bill is then reported.

from committee tothe floor of the
convention, where a ﬁnal report
is decided upon.

The purpose of the convention
is to give students practice and
experience in parliamentary pro-
cedures. The ﬁrst assemblies will
meet on Thursday, March 22, and
the convention will adjourn on
Saturday.

Because -of the restriction on
traveling enforced by the Oﬂice
of Defense Transportation, the
number of representatives from

Med Student Tells of Expedition
To Antarctic with Admiral Byrd

Although “Little America” and Pittsburgh are located at opposite
ends of the earth, Harrison Richardson, Med School senior in the Pitt
Navy V-12 unit is personally acquainted with both places. Harrison
was a member of the U. S. Navy Antartic expedition (1938-1941) com-
manded by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd.

sojourn in Antarctica, he once made a scientiﬁc surveying trip of 850

assistant meteorologist during his

miles with two companions. “That
trip was the most interesting part
of the expedition for me,” he .said.
“During it, we crossed huge crev-
assed areas of snow. That was
certainly an unforgettable experi-
ence.”

During the long winter night,
which incidentally is five months
long, the temperature remains
constant at approximately 76 de-
grees below zero. “I ha-d heard
about your breath freezing in
front of you, but I didn’t believe
it until I saw it with my own
eyes,” said Harri-son.

While on the surveying trip,
He and two companions lived on
rations and sometimes travelled
as far as 45 miles a day on skis.
“There’s a variation of 110 degrees
in the compass down there. It
makes travelling rather difficult-
but somehow we managed,” Har-
rison added.

The Byrd expedition had two
ships, the U. S. S. Bear (a sailing
vessel) and the U. S. S.‘ North

   

 

~ in .:Ea_ct

through the Straits of Magellan to
reach the South Polar region.
There are no people living in

the Antarctic region, there is no
vegetation, and the only vestige of
animal life consists of a few birds
(the oft-caricatured penguins)
and some seals. “All we saw was
mostly snow and lots of it,” Har-
rison commented. “Even the seals
migrate northward to escape the
long winter night. We always said
that anyone who hadany sense
left-—so we stayed.” '

Prior -to the Byrd expedition,
Harrison. spent some time in the
Merchant Marine and ‘made one
trip, which took him through the
Baltic sea to Russia. He was grad-
uated from Beaver high school
and attended Geneva college,
which he left at the end of his
sophomore year to join the Ant-
arctic expedition.

When asked whether he’d like
to go again, his blue eyes lit up,
and he g’rinned,j“I sure “would;

programs on Thursday and Friday,
including swimming, b o w I i n g,
smoker and theater parties. Sat-
urday evening house dances, the
only mixed events on the program,
will highlight most rushing sched-
ules.

Contact between fraternities and
freshmen is prohibited before 8:30
o’clock tomorrow morning. Dur-
ing the rushing period no rushee
may remain overnight at any fra-
ternity house, except those who
regularly live at a house. The
rushing rules, issued and enforced
by the Men’s Fraternity committee,
also state that contact with rushees
must end at 10:30 o’clock on
Thursday, midnight on Friday, and
2 o’clock on Sunday morning.

Norman Weissman, dental stu-
dent, has been selected by the In-
terfraternity council as rushing
chairman, and is charged with the
enforcement of rushing rules. He
has asked that “all members of
fraternities and all students be-

ing rushed cooperate with Inter-

fraternity council in observing
strict enforcement of all rushing
rules, and that a spirit of friendly
cooperation will prevail.”

Business Bureau
Reports Increase

A rise of ﬁve points last week
of the index of business in Pitts-
burgh district was reported by the
Bureau of Business Research, of
the University. A gain in out’-
going freight shipments originat-
ing in Pittsburgh and a sub-
stantial increase in industrial pro-
duction caused the boost which
followed an advance of about six
points in the preceding week.

Steel mill operations, bitum-
inous coal production, electric
power production, and coal and
river shipments all showed a
m a r k e d increase. Department
store sales rose moderately last
week, whereas bank debits declin-
ed considerably. Dollar sales of
Pittsburgh department s t-o r e s
showed an increase of 14 per cent
in the first seven weeks of 1945
over the same period last year.

We 24/Le Ptaneelpt ,

Six Pitt women have reached and passed their $100 pledge
mark for the 12th ﬂoor. _ And two of those women are faculty.
By mathematical ﬁguring, (6-2), we arrive at the large sum of
four undergraduate women who have met their pledges. Four
women out of 1100! That ’s something to think about.

Granted that the drive is just a little over a week old.
ranted also that there are girls other than those six well on the
way towards their goal. -Thenitoo there are probablyisomeof
you that are pounding the pavements, wearing out good shoe
leather, in door-to-door soliciting. And it is hard work and not
:‘always fruitful. All right, so you’re trying . . . some of you.

A H But in the dean of women’s ofﬁce, there’s a ﬁle of_ little
white cards. Remember theni? They ’re ‘the pledges you signed
. that Friday at the mass meeting. In case you didn’t look at them
-“very carefully, they’re white oblong cards with date lines on
A which to enter your contributions as you collect and turn them-
in.' And most of those cards are as spotlessly white as the day
they were placed in the ﬁle.

' You say, “But I’m not going to be here when the ﬂoor’s
4, ﬁnished. I’ll never get to enjoy it!” You consider that to be a
-sufﬁcient explanation. But is it: "
' * *
\Remcn1ber, that we’re the pioneers of Pitt, just as much as
~. those men and women who sat in a log cabin at the point of the
Golden Triangle in 1787. If they had said then, “\Ve’re too
old to go to school. \Ve’ll never enjoy an cdiication. Why
0 bother”3”, you can imagine where wc’d be. But those men and-
M Women were pioneers. _ They were building up their connnunity
~l for their children and the children of generations to come . . .
‘enerations of strange new settlers whom they would never
now. _ . '

 And what. if, in the 1840’s when the Academy was twice
burned down and for a period of 14 years the University was
nothing but a collection of funds and plans, what if during those
14 years, people had said, “VVhy botlier? We won ’t be here to
enjoy the school when it is reconstructed.” But of course they
iJw‘eren’t that kind of people; They worked and workedand
 orked some more with the result that you and I are going’ to
Pitt today. , _

A And during the last VVorld War, don’t you think Pitt faced
the same conditions? Pitt was a military post then, too, and an
nstruction center for the SATC, engineers, and technicians.
The Army was barracked in little wooden shacks up the hill,
many of which are still standing around Thaw and Alumni halls.‘
(And after the war, the University faced the same critical periods
_:When money was tight and she was badly in debt. But under
7Dr. Bowman the debts were cleared and the Cathedral built.
Those pioneers of the ,1920’s didn’t quit. '

V >3!‘ =ll= >X= SF

*

it , The University is nowhere near being completed; we have
just started. And till the Cathedral is ﬁnished and the proposed
dorms, student union, and labs added, we are all pioneers. We
often think of Pitt as being here such a long time. But when
"her short life is compared to schools of age——and to make the
contrast less vast we’ll conﬁne ourselves to the United States——
he is veryyoung alongside some of the “grey-beards.”

Some of you complain that you weren’t very enthusiastic
about the plan from the ﬁrst. You justify yourself by adding
that you think the plan silly, now in war-time. Well, if that’s
‘the case, why did you pledge your support, and why didn’t you,
at the mass meeting that Friday, stand up for all to hear and
istatte your case? _ If you think that outsidersglook upon the plan
., silly, and they evidently DO NOT as evidenced by the many
‘enthusiastic comments from strangers to Pitt, think how much
csillier the plan would look if we should fail. We need your
help in this campaign, and your whole—hearted help, for it will
take 100 per cent cooperation to put our drive across. As for
the war, all of the campaign money is being invested in war
jjbonds. When you support Pitt’s drive, you are supporting a
dual cause: the war effort and your school.

 What do you say? There are 1100 of us. That would be a‘
‘t .of:women’s intuition and wiles at work at the same time.
i e not going to depend uponsix women to carry our load

I Read As You Runi

Whether I am feeling particu-
larly literary or not, I can always
spend a pleasan=t—and often an
hilarious—ten minutes reading 'the
Personals column, of the Saturday
Review of Literature. The editor
speciﬁes that these items must be
“comm~unications of a decorous
nature,” so that one never sees
in the chaste pages. of -the SRL
such an advertisemen as “Prac—
tically illiterate sand hog wishes
to exchange dirty jokes with lady
taxi driver.” The typical SRL
personal ad is very mu-ch like
this one, which I quote from a
recent issue. “Somewhere on the
eastern seaboard there is a lovely

effort is likely to read, “She who
b 1 1; rs‘ 1‘ ad ‘sure
I n ,.  3, x  

lady, twentyish, thirtyish, who
would like to correspond with a
gentleman, thirtyish, who enjoys

ﬁne music, literature, theatre,
etc.” 
There are, however, several

more distinctive ‘types of person-
als, which fall easily into cate-
gories. For instance, here is an
example of the wistful type:
“Life’s routine might be bright-

ened considerably by letters from

a nice, intelligent young man.”
Then there is the poetic appeal:
“O Lassie fair and bright, Who
quiverest with joy at morning
light, And with tender melancholy
at sad, still night, Wilt thou write?
Box 638-K.” The intellectual cate-
gory is replete with challenges
like this: “Refined young lady in-
vites correspondence combining
intellectuality, understanding, fe-
licity, spirituality.” The esthetic
type plays, with minor variations,
upon this theme: “Esthetic prag-
matist seeks provocation in both
spiritual and earth-bound mores.
A delightful introvert-extrovert
with love -of writing, poetry,
drama, desires interesting female‘
corresp~ondence.” (Likes himself,
doesn’t he?)

Occasionally an ad with a real
sense of humor appears: “La-dies
dispossessed by vulture seek new
nest .” But even funnier to
the reader are the contributions of
a romantic nature like these:
“Knight Errant: Intelligent, spir-
itual maiden, thirtyish, seeks re-
lease from empty mail-box drag-
on.” “Gentleman, sincere, forty-
ish, widower, romantic, longing
correspondence lovely woman.”
And in contrast, this matter-of-
fact item: “Tree-Breeder, ex-
Iowan, would correspond with
stenographer typist interested in
plant biology. Object: intermit-
tent «collaboration, avocati-onal re-
search work on Hybrid Oak Crop
Trees.” Last of all is the provoca-
tive category, patronized by origi-
nal thinkers and believers in high-
powered advertising,‘whose typical

Dear Student Congress,
Lotsa people waltzed into the
Tuck shop last Thursdaymorning,

beaming, no less. It was the day I
after your Dutch Victory Dance. V

Larry Burwinkel was in a lee-ove-
ly mood. He stopped me and said,

“Lee, there was a great crowd*_

at the dance last night. Every-
thing went over swell.”
He would be the one to know.

But before the day was over, a

lot of other fellas and girls came
up to say they appreciated the
dance. They .a.sked me ‘to thank
youse. ,

Two‘ of th boys had ,a very
interesting question they wanted
passed on, however. I heard it
personally, an-d there was no sar-

castic i:mpl‘i~cation whatsoever.

that’s all. '

of the d.ance was... ‘Show Up or

Shut Up’. Well, we showed up.‘

What happens now?”

I guess he wants another one.
Yep, I think he’s a ni-ce boy, too.

Something that might surp-rise
you is that many of the students
feel too many of those dances
woul—d.n’t be too good a situation,
though. As one not-a-Student-

congress lad put it, “A~t:t-endance

 . Veteran_Tells of N azi Tactics
In German-Occupied France

It was 3 A. M., November 9, '1938.
Jules Kann and his father were asleep in their beds in Sarr-
brucken, France. Suddenly the sound of axes cracked at the door

down stairs and in marched Nazi storm troopers.

Once in, the Nazis

smashed the furniture of the home and_set ﬁre to it.
Thus was Jules Kann—present Pitt sophomore——introduced to the

persuasive tactics of Nazi ideology.

Jules and his father were then’

dragged out into the street. “Here
We met a hundred of our towns-
men. We were made to march
through the town cla-d only in our
pajamas,” related the twenty year
old lad. -
“We were marched to the syna-
gogue and there, were forced to
pour oil on it, set fire to it, and
watch it burn. On the w.ay to the
synagogue we were beaten and

I kicked by the storm troopers.”

Kann said that after the dem-
onstration, the prisoners whose
“crime” against the German Reich
was their religious belief and loy-
alty toward France were locked
up in the town jail for three days.
Then the one hundred men were
herded into a cattle—-car bound for
a concentration camp at Dachau,
Before reaching it,
twenty-one persons died standing
up. There was no room to fall,”
Jules added.

“At the camp,” continued Kann,
“the -citizens of Saarbrucken met
friends and relatives from all over
Germany, Austria, and other oc-
cupied territory.”

At Dauchau, Jules said he and
his father were interned for the
next three months. During this
time, he said, they were acquaint-
ed with the torture devices used
by the Germans to persuade the
captives to accept the views of
National Socialism.

Accor-ding to Jules, permission
received from the Ameri-can Con-
sul to enter the United States ﬁn-
ally released him and his father
from the camp. Before being re-
leased, however, Mr. Kann was
forced to give to the German
Reich all his property and mate-
rial Wealth. Also, Jules, then only
fourteen, was requested to» re-
main a month longer until -the last
traces of welts, received when
the curly-haired lad refused to
lick the -dirt from the boots of a
German ofﬁcver, were removed.

Jules then left the camp, and
returned to his hometown of Saar-
brucken only long enough to ﬁnd
his mother and younger ‘brother.

His family took the ﬁrst boat to
the United States.

Upon their arrival in this coun-
try in 1939 Mr. Kann brought his
family to Pittsburgh.

Jules went to Taylor Allderdice

Jules Kann

with honors.

He was studying medicine at
Pitt when he entered the United
States army in March, 1943.

When it was learned he could
speak ‘both French and German
ﬂuently, he was accepted into the
military intelligence. After three
months -of training, Jules was sent
to England, and from there, on an
invasion barge across the channel
to France on D-day. Within sight
of the French coast, a violent
storm -caused his barge 'to turn
back to England. On the way
back, he developed rheumatic
fever and was discharged three
months later.

“The funniest thing that ever
happened to me,” said Jules, “was
one day when I was riding down
a country lane in England in a
jeep. There by the side of the
road was a sign “To Hell with
Pitt, (signed) Carnegie Tech and
Penn State.”

Do you object to the midnight
curtailment of amusements? What
are you going to do instead? Your
wandering investigators pushed
their way through the Tuck shop
last week and asked various busy
scholars these questions.

Of thirty students questioned,
twenty-on-e were against the ban
and nine were in favor of it. The
majority of those in favor of the
ban were members of the fair sex.

to do instead of going to Mazer’s
or the Anchorage or any of the
other local pubs, one lovely lady
replied naively, “I don’t stay out
after twelve.” One of the most

popular answers was, “Stay at
home.” “Start early and come
home early,” was what one ‘sensi-
ble fellow said. One fair lass
blushed and said, “Please!” One
sharp character replied, “I’1l go to
my girl’s house. I h.ave more fun
there anyway.”

‘Many students are in favor of
having more house parties. Your
reporters sympathize with the fel-
low who answered, “I’m not in
favor of the ban. It kills my work.
I’m a musician.” Even though
most of the amusement places
around town will be closed after
twelve from now on, your report-
ers have come to the conclusion
that Pitt -students will not be stop-
ped from having fun. ‘

Woman Vet Enrolls
In Education Here

‘One of the four woman veterans
who attend classes at Pitt is Pa-
tricia Jane MacCleary, private in
the marine corps Women’s reserve.
Pat, who is registered in second-
ary pre-education, intends to
teach history. Before entering the
marine corps, she was a student at
Allegheny college for two years.

During her 15 months of service,
she did photographic work, de-
veloping and printing pictures for
public relations at marine aviation
bases at El Toro, California and
Miramar near San Diego.

P.at, who likes to know people,
thinks the large enrollment at
Pitt gives her an opportunity to
.make many new friends. A sports
enthusiast, she likes to watch the
fast play of football and basketball
games and is an avid spectator at
,w‘restling matches.

“Give Buck;
Don’t Pass It”

‘The 'World Student’s Service
Flllnld drive at Pitt has got under
way with Ed Citron, C, and Ruth
.Miller, Ed, chairmen, having set the
Pitt goal at $999.99. The purpose
of WSSF is to endeavor to aid sui-
dents aﬁected by the war through-
out the World by purchasing for
them books‘ and supplies. Food
and clothing in some cases will
be provided for the War prisoners
and refugees. I

Slogan for Pitt’s campaign this
year is “Give the Buck; Don’t Pass
It” since the total amount to be

collected represents approximately
one dollar per student. Each stu-
dent will be approached individ-
ually through his fraternity, senior
counselor, or guild. Steve Bucher,
C, and Peggy Strathearn, C, co-
chairman of publicity, have an-
nounced that students may also
obtain information from the booth
_on the ground ﬂoor of. the Cathe-
dral. Contributions may be made
directly or by means of pledges
payable in either the YMCA or
YWCA ofﬁces. I

In connection with the drive
a special program has been plan-
ned for March, 6. Dr. Homer Loh,
general secretary of the Chinese
Students’ Christian association in
North America, will address a din-
ner for solicitors and interested
students in the army mess hall
at 6 0’-clo-ck. At a special lunch-
eon in the Faculty club on Wed-
nesday,'March 7, the faculty will
be given an opportunity to hear
Dr. Loh. ‘So that students may be-
come more familiar with the work
of the fund, workers will have
lunch with. stu-dents in the army
mess hall Thursday at 12:30
-o’clock. ’

By Ursula Halloran

As a lethargic reaction to Hello
Week we’re proclaiming this week
as Hush Week. The idea is not to
speak to anyone, not even your
best friends. And today we’re
sponsoring a lunch in the Red
Tuck Shop where everyone sits
by himself in the corner. So re-
member—ssshhh!

Running in close competition
with the resignation of Chancellor
Bowman last week was the Chuck
(Fausto) Tremont-Betty Lou Hil-
ligas pinning. This whirlwind
event was the climax of two rrred
hot dates. —

Last week was a big Psi 0
week, or here’s another pinning.
Ray Blaine gave his pin to Jane
Turnblazer. And still speaking of
the Psi O’s, Don Comley got Jack
Scullen and Bob Verklin blind
dates with two West (Bigod) Vir-
Queens. “Burlesque, of
course,” moaned Verklin.

A pinning of week before last——
or was it the week before that?--
was med Les Dunmire’s. The girl
is Enid Mitchell, home from Wil-
son college at the time.

‘This is the little story of two
people who have designs on our
«column, all in fun of course. It
seems that this pair got their
skulls ‘together and poured out
some typewritten drivel called
Campus Parade. (They must have
a knack for original names). They
waited and waited for it ‘to ap-
pear in the News, but nothing
happened. Whereupon these two
monsters slunk back to their cave
to plot control of Pittpourri after
June graduates.

As competition for what was
reputedly the best party Phi Gam
has thrown for months, Chuck
Berg had a brawl in the true
sense of the word at his house.
The’ question puzzling those who
attended is, “Who dynamited the
hole in the middle of the living
room rug?” At the same time
Belle of the Ball on Wallingford
Street was Margie Matey, who had
not only a sharp former Fiji
prexy, but also a smooth Psi O as
dates.

Can’t we keep these Psi O’s out

of the column this week? This
week Frank Marmarose presented
our girl Jean (York, Pa.) Bischoff,
who’s eager-beavering at Magee
Hospital, with a ring, amidst the
moans and groans of all the local
swains.

Event—With a capital E—of the
Delt-Phi Ep semi-formal was the
Buddy Lenchner-Howie Lupovitz-
Dick Seewald trio. They wowed
’em with the old tear-jerker,
“Genevieve”, complete with soggy
handkerchiefs.

Fraternity men are ﬂocking in
droves to the dance for student
nurses at the Allegheny General
Hospital on April 6. The aﬁair is
from 9 to 12——everyone is sup-
posed to come early to take his
pick. Seventy nurses (how does
that sound?) and an orchestra.
Pattie Watt is being cupid’s help-
er for the dance, so see her all
about it.

We’re glad to see a Lambda Chi
pin going into circulation around

 

campus. It’s Al Dobbie’s', and the
recipient (big word) is Jearme
Palmer. An-d our tears ﬂowed like
wine. Terriﬁc was the Valentine
Walt “Pope” Popiel gave Lois
Woistman. We hear this is some-
thing worth watching.

Freshman Ginnic Barker’s Val-
entine was a huge diamond en-
gagement ring from Paratrooper
Eddie Moore. Speaking of novel
engagements, she received the ring
in an angel food cake at a surprise
dinner party.

We wrote our column this week
by the light of Jean Wyckoff’s
diamond and ruby engagement
ring. The lucky man is Dick Mc-
Cormick.

And here—a last minute ﬂash——
comes another Psi O pinning. Are
there any left? Bill Norris and
Mary Jane McGinty, this time.

Somebody suggested that we
use a fantastic Li’l Abner ending
this week, but we told him we
never read Li’l Abner. Li’l Abner
reads us! However, we feel that
Tobacco Rhoda is a character
worth a mention. In fact, we’ve
selected Tobacco Rhoda of the Pitt
Campus. See us for the name of
the lucky girl. Chop chop!

R. R. Exhibit
In Arts Gallery

An, exhibition tracing the de-
velopment of railroad station arch-
itecture from the ﬁrst half of the
nineteenth century to the present
time is now being shown in the
Fine Arts gallery. It has been
prepared by the Yale graduate stu-
dents in the history of art and is
being circulated by the American
Federation of Arts. The sixteen
display panels present pictures
and commentaries on the architec-
tural history of stations. Railroad
stations, like the more famous
world structures, often reﬂect the
times in which they were built in
style and form of construction.

The exhibit acquaints the vis-
itor with the far-reaching conse-
quences of railroad progress in our
country, which has given impetus
to the growth of inland cities, ex-
tensive erection of bridges, and
has stimulated the idea of travel
for pleasure and sight-seeing.

Department Plans Dance

“Spring Fever,” an informal
dancing party sponsored by the
music department, will be given
sometime in the near future ac-
cording to an announcement by
Evelyn Kusserow, Ed, president
of W-omen’s Choral.

The following musical organiza-
tions will be represented: Wom-
en’s Choral, Men’s Glee club,
Heinz Chap-el choir, Orchestra,
and Band. Chairman Ann Henry,
C, will be assisted by a commit-
tee made up of members of the
various organizations. The affair
will probably be held in the Ca-
thedral gym, and deﬁnite details
will be announced later.

 

Men’s Debating association
will meet today at 3:30 o’clock
in the debate office, 804 Cathe-
dral. All those wishing to travel
to Penn State must be present,
because important plans will
be announ-ced concerning the
trip. ' A

Law School Returns

To Peacetime Status

The State Board of Law Exam-
iners has indicated its disapproval
of accelerated programs of study
in law schools and has asked these
schools to return‘ to non-accelerat-
ed programs. The Board stated
that students beginning their law
studies after May, 1945 will not be
qualiﬁed to take the state bar ex-
amination if they take accelerated
work. This will necessitate a re-
version to the pre-war program.

The new law class includes two
veterans who are resuming their
studies under the GI Bill ‘ of
Rights. These men already have
their bachelor of arts degree
which is a prerequisite for entry

place.

Now that rushing is over and
everyone can again “act normal,”
speak to people, and breathe eas-
ier; fraternities have divulged
some of their secrets to successful
parties. '

The AEPhis had a Candlelight
Dessert party at the Cardinal room
of th.e Hotel William Penn on Sat-
urday night. The mothers of ac-
tives and guests were invited and
alumnae speakers participated in
the program. ,

Beta. Sigma donned formals and
made theiroappearance at Club
Beta with a host of acts including
a chorus of “Q You Beautiful
Dolls,” a barber shop quartette,
and Beta Sig’s Pink Lady.

A Garden -of the Moon party
with a wishing well, and a star
room was given by the Tri Delts.
For the occasion, grass grew on
the ﬂoors (ﬁguratively, of course)
and rose arbors were put up.

Saturday night the Delta Zetas
got together at the D Z Bar
Ranch. Their house was camou-
ﬂaged with bales of hay and
shocks of corn.

The Zetas party was a Naughty
Nineties Review with three ﬂora
doras, a barber shop quartette.
and a parody on nineteenth-cen-
tury lovers and modern lovers.

Three -Chinamen appeared at
the TPA party, alias Chris Man-
ion, Tuck Baldasary, and Tillie
Sanker, An oriental effect was ac-

'.llIIllll|lIIlllllllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIllllIIIIIIllll|I|_II||III|IlI|lllIlIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllIllIllllllllllllllllllllllg

complished with a Chinese gong,
incense, and red: and white table-
cloths. ,

A Theta Plantation was the
theme’ of the ‘Theta Saturday night
party. Their chapter room rep-
resented a boat piloted by Cap-
tain Joan igby.

The Kappas wore the costumes
of Greenwich Villagers for their
Friday night affair. Guests’ were
taken on a tour of an artist’s stu-
dio, village barn, and an Italian
restaurant.

Fish nets covered the door of
the Phi Mu apartment for their
Deep Sea Party. Highlights of the
affair were under-water relays,
the sailor’s hornpipe rendered by
two sailors who in civilian life are
Marge Torker and B. J. Bendel.

Phi Sigma Sigma held a Car-
nival party with barkers Aileen
Lavine and Denny M.iller drawing
the crowd to different booths
where Hieleen Granovitz told for-
tunes.

A Coke-tail party was given by
the Chi Os which featured imita-
tion mixed drinks. A ﬂoor show
was provided with Pauline Gu-
Zanick as Carmen Miranda.

Last Thursday was no holiday
as far as the frats were concerned.
The S-AEs, the Pi Lams, the Phi
Delts, the PiKAs, and the Sigma
Chis made’ ﬁnal preparations -for
rushing by completing their house
redecorations.

We wish a speedy "recovery to
Phi Delt Dick Smith who was

taken to the Presbyterian Hos-
pital after receiving a compound
dislocated elbow in the Phi Delt-
Phi Gam basketball game.

‘The Pi Lambs are planning for
several glorious week ends in the
near future. The reason is that
their chapters at West Virginia
and Penn State have just reopen-
ed with brand new frat houses.

The PiKAs initiated Paul Lam-
bert and Bob Nagel last week and
pledged Tommy Ogg. Then to end
up the week with a bang they had
a mad party for Abbie Steinkirch-
ner who left for Florida last Sun-
day. I

The Phi Eps gained one and lost
three this week when Mort Selt-
man, Mel Blib_erg,~ e- and Bud
Lenchner left for the navy and
Sandy Lampl came home on leave
from Great Lakes.

Last Friday the Delts celebrated

their annual alumni banquet at-

the Hotel Roosevelt. The guest
speaker for the evening was the
president of the Pittsburgh Cham-
ber of Commerce. The SAES were
much too busy working on their
house to eat, but they did ﬁn-:1
time to initiate ‘Steve Bucher. And
last but not least, the Sigma Chis
cancelled their scheduled bowling
party in favor of the movies last
Friday.

popular campus leader: take a big

helping of personality; mix it with
a large portion of popularity; sea-

son with a few bright smiles and
a dash of humor, and bake in an
oven of warm friendship until
done. The result should closely
resemble Bob Dixon, BA, one of
the most popular and well—liked

The only civilian agency permitted’
by the War and Navy Departments
to accompany our men and women of
the armed forces into combat areas
everywhere at all times, the Red Cross
brings the morale-sustaining link with
home, the little comforts that are so

' truly our heritage, the helpinghand in
time of trouble. Through the Red
Cross there is assurance that trained
nurses, blood plasma, surgical dress-

ings, supplemental clothing will be
at hand when emergency strikes.

To make certain that Red Cross
services will be continued during the
year of greater need ahead, the resi-
dents, workers and business of Pitts-
burgh and Allegheny County are
asked to raise $3,604,000 of the na-
tional quota of $200,000,000. This
amount is greater than that sought
last year because your own Pittsburgh
Chapter faces expanded needs for
service to the next-of-kin of prisoners

returning veterans.

Pitt played exceptionally well in’
their victory over the Mountain
Men and after the 3rd quarter it
was no longer a contest. The
Mountaineers jumped off to an
early lead and after a see-saw
ﬁrst period, Pitt trailed by a sin-
gle point. In the second quarter
the Phantoms displayed a dazzling
exhibition of passing and as Hank
Zeller took control of the back
boards, the Pittites forged ahead.
They had a first-half lead of 27-26

The ﬁnal quarter added a bit more
of excitement to the game with
blows about to take Piace between
Pitt center Hank Zeller and West
Virginia substitute Lopez. Lopez
and Zeller were both yanked be-
fore fists ﬂew. Dr. Carlson sent
in ‘a ﬂood of substitutes with 4
minutes remaining and the score

points before the gun sounded.

to 12-11. At the intermission the
Mountaineers grabbed a 28-19

largely upon who controlled the

The Panthers rallied to tie count

Will there be a change?

We’ve changed Chancellors, but
have we changed athletic policies?
Gone are the days of lithe power-
ful Sutherland Scythes. In their

place, squads have been ﬁelded
that served as soft tou-ch-es for
every power in the collegiate cir-
c-uit. Back in the late 30’s, when
they stopped giving Jock the type
o-f material that could match the
gruelling schedules which were
set up, the Silent Scot crisply
said, “I won’t ﬁeld a team that
doesn’t have at least an even
chance of winning.”«He was will-
ing to coach an eleven that could
go out and hold its own. It didn’t
matter wheth-er opponents were
Big Ten powerhouses and South-
ern Conference steamrollers, or
colleges like Spearﬁsh normal and
Paducah U., he only insisted that
his boys would no-t play out of
their class.

The athleti.c policy of the Uni-
versity as carried out by Jimmy
Hagan, and probably wreathed in
Dr. Bowman’s ‘tacit approval, was
of a different nature. We wanted
to crash the “400” of football——
the Big Ten. However, we were a
mite too powerful for the “cream
of the midwest,” and they hinted
that if we cleaned out our sys-
tem of subsidization they might
‘consider us. We had to clean out
ours but theirs ﬂourished. Offers
were no longer extended to entice
boys to -enroll at Pitt, yet other
top-ﬂight schools managed to lure
high school stars to their cam-
puses and thus produce top-ﬂight
teams. ‘

Did these other colleges, who
scorned our system, follow the
simon—pure process of offering
capable ‘ball-players just educa-

tional opportunities? Steve Lach
didn’t leave Altoona to play for
Duke’s Blue Devils because he’d
heard so much about Southern
hospitality. Jim Daniels, whose
brother Ave was All-American
here at Pitt and who hails from
Mt. Lebanon, played four years
of bang-up ball for the Scarlet
Scourge of Ohio State. I don’t
think the Buckeye country is that
much. pleasanter than the land at
the fork -of the three rivers. The
unwritten law of collegiate foot-
ball states that boys must ;be com-
pensated for participating. As to
the morals of it, that’s another
issue.

In our de-emphasizing only a
half—way job was done. T-he talent
no longer poured in, but the sched-
ule would have made any coach
wring his hands, shake his head,
and wonder how he’d manage to
break even that year. As a result
whenever Pitt is now mentioned
anywhere they speak of the glory
that used to «be and at the same
time (scornfully smeer, ‘‘What’s
happened to you guys?” The pay-
oﬁ is that we haven’t crashed the
Tig Ten and are about as close
to it as Yamashito is to Wash-
ington.

It’s obvious that a try was made I

and just as obvious that it was
muffed. Now what? It’s our team,
our glory or ignominy, our pride
or shame, our winner or loser.
Has the reputation of the Uni-
versity been enhanced since we’ve
become a breather on big-time
schedules? Those institutions that
decried our lack of sch"'olasti_c
stand-ing when we had ﬁne teams
aren’t so ﬂagrant in their accusa-
tions these victoryless days. About
the only ‘thing that we’ve. accom-
plished has been to humiliate our-
selves on the gridirons of the na-
tion. Our standards haven’t chang-
ed. They are now, and always
were, capable of being matched
with those of universities through-
out the nation.

L-et’s join the parade. Not every-
body’s out of step except the
University of Pittsburgh. I’m sure
that the student body will fer-
vently “Hail to Pitt,” if “We show
the worthy foe that the Panther’s
on the go.”

Will there be a change?

Hank Zeller Proves

Big Hank Zeller, Carlson’s Center

The fact that the “fearless

mediocre outﬁt was due in no
small part to six—foot-four Hank

Zeller. Without the big fellow
holding the center post, Dr. H. C.
Carlson’s cagers would have been
lucky to break even this year
instead of sporting an 8—won, 4-
lost record.

He controlled the backboards,
tipped in rebounds, set up plays,
guarded the opponents’ star, and
furnished a lot of height that re-
cent Pitt teams have sorely need-

, ed. On the night that Pitt walloped
 Westminster, he had Noble Jor-

genson tied up in a knot, while

Without him the Carlson combine
would have been like cheese with-
out apple pie—and I don’t mean
it the other way around.

Zeller started his basketball
career at St. George high and
then matriculated at Washington
and Jefferson to get his college
knowledge. He played three years
of varsity ball there and climaxed
his career by going to the New
York Metropolitan Invitational
Tournament in 1943 with Coach
Adam Sanders‘ district champs.
The Prexies, seeded seventh, plac-
ed third in basketball’s ‘‘world
series.” ~ .

A few months later he grad-
uated, joined the Navy, and was
then sent to the Pitt medical
school. Hank played for the Cor-
bett club, last year’s Muny League
champs, and so was i-n tip-top
shape when he joined this year's
edition of the Panther ﬁve.

week the Pitt ROTC
Riﬂe Team set a new record in
scoring when they defeated a total
of four teams in ﬁve matches. Out
of a possible 2000 perfect score
the ROTC Unit ﬁred the excellent
score of 1832.,

The ﬁve men responsible for this
remarkable score are:

With each man ﬁring a total of
400 rounds the chances of his
keeping a consistently high score
lessen -more and more. _ Despite
this, each man came through with
ﬁne scores.

In obtaining this
score the ROTC Team defeated
Ohio State, Michigan, Montana

State, and Syracuse while losing to _
Michigan State College by only ' '

one point.

The Riﬂe team has a fairly heavy
schedule in the coming weeks.
This week they will ﬁre against
Georgia Tech and Texas A. & M.
and next week they will compete
against N. Dakota, Nebraska, Ala-

State.

An up-to—date tabulation of the
riﬂe team record since the week
of‘February 12 shows a total of 9
wins against 3 defeats. Each time
a team lost, it was defeated by

200 points or more while the three "

teams defeating us were: Mary-

land, by 7 points; Virginia Poly-v
tech, by 5 points; and Michigan

State by one point.

Results from the recently held
Third Service Command matches
have not been tabulated yet and
no ﬁnal scores are available.

The results of the annual Wil-

tional Rifle matches were received
by the military department this
week. These results showed Pitt’s
ﬁrst team in possession of fourth
place with a score of 868 out of
1000. ‘This is excellent shooting,
considering that the University of
Maryland, which took ﬁrst honors
in the meet, shot a total of 892.
Two teams representing Western
Maryland college took second and
third pl-aces. Our riﬂemen missed
third place, and a trophy, by only

scored 725 to edge out Penn

Few of Kind
In Country

Many books are in our libraries
today that wouldn't be t-here if
it weren’t for the University Press

at Pitt. Few colleges, indeed, are?

privileged to have their own pub-
lishing house.

Like most university presses,
Pitt’s is a subsidy operating as a
non-profit organization. For this
reason, many authors in Western
Pennsylvania who iwould never
have realized success have had
their work published and have
contributed such worthwhile ma-
terial to lPennsylvania’s literature.

In 1937, the University Press
published its first book which was

written by Mrs. Agnes Starrett;

The date of publication of this
book was arranged for the 150th
anniversary of the founding of
Pitt and was titled Through One
Hundred and Fifty Years: the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Mrs. Starrett’s book is a record
of the history of the University,
of the regional cultures, of the
