Reject Un ionization Plan

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Pitt support personnel rejected
unionization by a vote of 903 to 487
yesterday, sparking a promise by
the defeated union’s representative
that “we'll see the University in
court.”

Michael Butera, a professional
/.,onsultant for the University of

‘ — fflttsburgh Support"Personnel As-

sociation (UPSPA) that lost yester-
day's election to a no-union vote,
declined to elaborate on his
statement, although it is reported
the charges may involve intimida-
tion of the staff by University
administrators.

University representatives said
they had no official comment on the
reported charges and added to

Dr. David Powers, formerly the

Both Powers’ position and duties

a memo from Provost Rhoten

Powers will continue to act as

The Commuter Association (CA)
faces possible withdrawal of its
status as a student organization
due to alleged violations of the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tion (CSO) bylaws.

The CSO held a hearing on the
alleged violations Tuesday, but
refused to make a recommendation
to the Student Government Board
(SGB) until after today’s CSO
executive session.

The hearing was the result of an
Allocations Committee request the
CS0 examine the status of the
Commuter Association, according

to C50 Chairman Hank Kearney. ,

In a letter to CSO, the Allocations
Committee stated it would be

unable to make a budget recom- ,

mendation without a CSO. recom-
mendation because of questions
regarding the Commuter Associa-
tion’_s membership. '

According to Kearney the CS0
will review three alleged violations
of the CS0 by-laws: ' .

—the CA did not hold an election
of officers;

‘—the CA did not have enough
active members:

— the CA failed to abide by its
constitution. I

change wasvmade because neither
Pitt, Stadium nor Beaver Stadium
has adequate lighting for a
night time telecast.

An announcement conﬁrming
the switch has not come from the
Penn State athletic department as
yet, because some of the details
involved in the agreement have to
be settled. ‘

The main roadblock to finalizing

the plan is the decision of who is to.

be afforded the luxury of being the
home team. Although Penn State
is listed as the host team this year,
it may be reluctant to assume the
$30-40,000 “operating costs” in-
volved in renting Three Rivers,

bylaws at a meeting Tuesday.

According to CSO advisor Dave-
Tive,- the " CSO by-laws do not
include any provisions requiring a

student organization to have
elections or adhere to its owy
bylaws. ‘ i

In CSO_ guidelines for maintain-
'ing recognition there is a provision
that permits CS0 to revoke the
recognition or privileges of a group

aime Rescheduled-

Both Pitt and Penn State will net
approximately $244,000 in tele-
vision money for the national
broadcast. The team that will give
up the home ﬁeld advantage,
however, stands to lose about
_$50,000 in concession receipts, as
has been the case with Pitt the past
two years.

Penn State Athletic Director Ed
Czekaj was tight-lipped and grim
when confronted with the report 0
the change. “I have nothing to say
at this time,” Czekaj said. “I will
wait for the release from ABC.”

You’re kidding. You mean a
month has passed since school

ended and you still don’t have a
summer job? All you do day after

 day is sleep until noon, watch

television until dusk and drink beer
until dawn? What a boring

a existence. Did you ever think of
’ 0' going out and actually looking for
i work?

Oh, you have looked for a’
job—and there just don’t seem to
.,,_be any out there? Well, turn off the

_ soap opera for a few minutes and

read on. You obviously haven't
considered all the possibilities.

GO INTO BUSINESS FOR .
YOURSELF

Why not be yourvown boss?

A There are plenty of summertime

trades an enterprising young
college student like you can get

" involved in and, in the process,
, earn whopping amounts of cash.

For instance, you could go into
business cutting grass. Throw an

, old lawnmower into the truck of an

old car, stick a pair of old garden
snippers into your back pocket and
paste a sign to the side of the car
door. Now you’re ready to roll—all
the way to the bank. That’s
providing you have an Italian-
sounding name, or pretend to have
one. Nobody will hire a “Gene
Smith the Grasscutter” to do their
lawn. So simply change your sign
to “Geno Smitini’s Landscaping

‘ Company” and you're in business.

Or why not paint houses? All it
takes is a ladder, a paint brush, a
white cap and a little note pad.
The note pad is a must if you plan
to be a successful painter. You
need to pull it out every so often
and pretend to be making
professional calculations. Then
your clients don’t feel cheated

' when they get your outlandish bill.

I

And, if all else fails, you can
always collect Coke bottles from
garbage cans in front of the drug
store. They’re worth a dime a piece
nowadays. After each day of hard,
sweaty work collecting bottles, you
might even have enough money
to buy yourself a tall bottle of Coke.
Not only will it quench your thirst,
but you’ll have a headstart on the
next day's work.

What’s that—you don’t like the
idea of going into business for
yourself? You say it’s too big a risk
to invest in a lawnmower, a ladder,
or even a wagon to collect bottles,
when you might not earn enough to
pay for them?

Naturally, there is a slight risk
involved, but...oh 0 ‘well, let’s
consider your other options.

TAKE A “SIMPLETON” JOB

Since you’re leery about going
into business for yourself, you
obviously want a job that guaran-
tees you a steady flow of crisp bills
stuffed into your ﬁst every week.
In other words, you want a normal
job. I

But don’t forget, school’s been
out for a month. - All the
high-paying jobs working in factor-
ies and hospitals and serving iced
tea at posh country clubs were
gobbled up long ago. Your only
hope is to take a “simpleton” job.

Exactly what is a “simpleton”
job? It is work designed for people
with a brain the size of a mosquito
egg, or smaller. And there are
millions of these jobs} Because the
people who are best suited for
these jobs are such simpletons they
don’t even know the jobs exist.
That’s where you cash in.

Take your pick. You can be a

HEAD FOR THE COAST

If you’re set on earning big
money, it looks like you’ll have to
make a beeline for the shore. New
Jersey, Florida, California—it

doesn’t. matter which coast you
pick. They’re all packed with places

that need to hire a lot of summer
help if they're going to soak the
tourists for every last nickel.
Whether you work in a restaurant
or on a bustling boardwalk, you can

haul in a respectable wa e._ _
What’s that—you don’ think it’s .

humanly possible to save any
money at the shore? You spend it

all on alcohol, food, alcohol,
lodging and" alcohol? Well
yes...but you’re still forgetting one
thing. ’

If you go to the shore, you just
might spend every cent you earn.
And if you go into business for
yourself or get a “simpleton” jpb,
you might even end up losing
more than you earn.

But you’ll still be better off than
you are now. Because instead of
moping around the house, watch-
ing soap operas, and complaining
about not having a job—you’ll be
doing something. And chances are
you’ll even have fun doing it.

“Past experiences indicate we

According to SCATH member
Steve Weiner, efforts to contact
SCATH’s endorsing organizations
are draining time and energy from

Kugler said organizations de-
serve an outlet for active input into
SCATH and should be kept
informed of SCATH’s activities.

No formal action was. taken to

According‘ to Chaban the CA is
also responsible for locating more

Kearney questioned whether the
organization could be serving
commuters successfully with only
seven active members. “The
organization has not held an

Kearney said. '

According to Tive, punitive
recommendations available to the

If the SGB would pass a CSO ‘

If the Board passes a CSO

become ineligible for funds from

Residents
Speak

Bayard Street residents aren't
anxious to talk about their
problems with the neighborhood’s
fraternity houses, but they admit
the problems exist.

“When it gets to be two or three
in the morning and you can still
hear the bands, that’s too much,”
one resident complained. (The
residents, all living on the 4700
block of Bayard, asked that they
not be identified by name.)

“The big problem is just
thoughtlessness,” the resident
added.

The resident said the problems
recurred every few years regard-
less of what agreements are made.
“You get students in at the age of
17 or 18, and by the time they
mature and realize you are there,
they have graduated and you have
to reeducate a whole new bunch.”

Of the five residents who spoke
to the Pitt News about the
fraternities, only one said there
was no problem. “They are just
kids. Sometimes they get too
noisy, but I don’t mind them.”

Many residents said they would
rather handle the problem without

a newspaper coverage, and said they

would prefer not to offer their
One reason cited for
not wanting coverage was the
effect publicity could have on
property values in the neighbor-
hood.

One resident termed the be-
havior of the fraternity members

“childish,” and accused them of .

more than just noise. “The houses
are run-down and look terrible,"
the resident said. “And there have
been cases where people have been
throwing snowballs and ﬁrecrack-
ers.”

The resident said the neighbor-
hood homeowners had tried to be
patient with the fraternities, but
had come to the end of _the rope.
“We just don’t feel we should have
to put up with this any longer.” _

Greeks Counter

Members of Bayard Street
fraternities have mixed opinions
concerning recent community char-'
ges of irresponsible behavior and.
harrassment, but most say the
charges are unjustified and that the
issue has been , blown out of
proportion. .

Suspension of University recog-
nition is the most severe punish-
ment that could be imposed on the
six Bayard fraternities because of
residents’ complaints centering on
late-night noise. One fraternity,
Phi Kappa Theta, is located at 4616
Bayard, one block from a row of
ﬁve Greek houses on the 4700
block of Bayard.

“The trouble is mostly down the
block," Phi.Kappa Theta member
Chuck Waskiewicz said. “We
haven’t had many problems or

complaints here.”

“It is unjustified that we should
even face suspension,“ Ray Per-
kins, another member of Phi Kappa
Theta, said. “We -make a
conscious effort to constrain any
activity that could have an adverse
effect on the community.

“We’re lucky to be by ourselves
with a neighbor on one. side only,
where the other frats are in a
group,” Perkins said.

Members of four of the five
fraternities located on Bayard’s

'4700 block said they believed the

neighbors’ charges are unjustiﬁed,
for a variety of reasons.

Delta Tau Delta’s Harry Habbel
and Zeta Beta Tau’s Lee Lillienthal
said complaints of late-night noise
were nothingnew.

“Frats were here long before
these people moved in,” Habbel
said, ‘ ‘and the reputation of frats is
pretty well established. The noise

  The Young Hacks

BY TOM WASELESKI

Ever ‘since that pair of young

hacks from The Washington Post
pried the lid off the biggest political
pressure cooker in this country’s
history, journalism has been taking
a long if not telling look at itself.

Does it necessarily follow then
that the movie version of V the
Woodward-Bernstein chronicle, All
the President’s Men, should raise
similarly painful questions about
the ﬁlm industry?

Indeed, did the movie ‘have to
follow at all?

About as popular as paciﬁsm
toward Hitler's Germany, this view
comes in the face of the casting of
Hollywood’s two‘ contemporary
heartthrobs, . rave reviews by
the critics and a story line that
surpasses all the recent disaster
ﬁlms in total voltage.

Perhaps it was said in the posh
den of some ﬁlm even years ago, or
else it could’ve been at poolside,
that such casting, such reviews and
such a high-charged plot could be
guaranteed (not to mention smash-
ing box ofﬁce receipts), so long as a
historic tragedy could be staged
and later be made into a movie.

was the arrest of the chair, long
known to be a CIA operative, and

the uncovering of the CIA’s
Operation Upholstery.

Operation Unholstery involved
more than three hundred contor-
tionists recruited from the ranks of
Mexican wetbacks, who acted as
furniture in the homes of leading
Democrats thought to be consort-
ing with the devil. ‘

The operation, which cost the
American taxpayer nearly $700,000
over a three-year period, also
entailed the extortion of varnish
from a major shellac manufacturer
in order to make the agents “look
real." in the words of one agent
called to the stand. '

The committee was on the verge
of learning more about Operation
Upholstery when one key witness
was strangled by his own tie while
on the witness stand.

Committee experts are speculat-
ing it could result in revelations
linking the CIA to certain silktie
manufacturers, as‘ well as an
exposition of intelligence-related

backingfor. a recent solar eclipse. .

Redford and Dustin Hoffman get

While newspapermen are laud-

_ing the ‘ﬁlm and expecting a

heightened rush into the glamor-
ously regarded activity of investi-
gative reporting, the only proper
way to react to All -the President’s
Men is with outrage and the
depressing realization the Ameri-
can people have been screwed over
even on the Big'Screw.

The movie delivers little more
than a host of prettier faces

about (or at least should’ve) been

newspapers.

Bernstein’s quest for the hole_ in

Pitt ROTC: 1976 E   Letters

BY CONNIE GIEL

1" Midway through Armed Forces
Week, dedicated to the more than
two million serving in the military,
Pitt’s Reserve Ofﬁcers Training
Corps (ROTC) has become more
obvious in the past few days than
it was all year.

Young men and women in
uniform this week have watched
their piles of leaflets go largely
undistributed as other students
obliviously wandered past ROTC
booths in the Student Union.

Few stopped to question or
otherwise express interest in the

/'

I

)program—but no one jeered or tore
.«.. fie pamphlets into pieces, either. It

seems the armed forces, and its
collegiate extension, ROTC, are no
longer the source of a burning
campus controversy.

Those in ROTC say it is time,
therefore, to reexamine the policies
of the 1960s, when the program
_came under heavy attack, and
legitimize ROTC at ‘Pitt;

Five years ago Pitt faculty,
spurred by vocal anti-militaristic
students, voted to eliminate credit
for ROTC courses. Enrollment
dropped in the next few years from
hundreds to dozens, since ROTC
students, in effect, had to take an
overload of 16 credits to satisfy
both the graduation andjprogram

equirements. _

3 -'The credit discontinuation af-

fected the College of Arts' and

Sciences, in which the majority of

ROTC students are enrolled as
degree candidates.

Though‘ enrollment in ROTC

‘nationally and in other area schools
has slightly increased, Pitt’s
non-credit status has contributed to
a steady decrease._ Many ROTC
instructors said the vote against
credit was, in fact, a vote against
the program itself, since the effect
has been to guarantee instability.

In 1968, the most controversial of
years for ROTC, the University

the Air Force ROTC program at
Pitt, says discussion of those points
should not be the cornerstone upon
which accreditation rests.

“Last year’s vote, (which main-
tained denial of credit) was still one
of emotions,” Goldstein said.
“The question now is one of
justice. ROTC is every bit as
legitimate a program as anything
offered by any other department at
Pitt. Why should its students be
penalized for sampling another way
of thinking?” .

Goldstein said he doesn’t think
anti-militaristic feelings are active-
ly voiced on campus today. “There
are too many other things to worry
about on this campus; the budget,
for one. «ROTC isn’t the issue for
most people,” he said.

Pitt ROTC Coordinator Robert
Nossen said several weeks ago that
the credit vote pinpointed the
general student unrest in the ’60s.
“ROTC was a visible sign of the
military, and all the “negative
values attached to it,” Nossen said.

The visible signs of the military
in ROTC have since disappeared.
Drills are largely optional, as is

A physical training.

Uniforms are worn at the
student's discretion, or to com-
memorate during special events
such as the current Armed Forces

Week.

But the program’s essence
remains. Its objectives and.
expectations are unchanged.

ROTC personnel insist the program
should be an integrated part of the
University. Its students should be
drawn_ from the whole of the
university to ensure reﬂection of
differing opinions and values. Lack
of credit for ROTC courses may be
weakening the program by limiting
participation to students willing or

able to take an additional semester

of courses.

Theclimate on campus may have
changed completely since 1968, or
feelings against ROTC may lie
smoldering, awaiting another
credit by the program’s advocates.
This time next year the uniforms
may be fewer—at the University’s
expense.

to the Editor

Isn't a Faculty
Assembly Fair?

Your May 11 issue reports
Student Government opposition to
the Governance Committee plan for
revision of the University Senate:
This is accompanied by a strongly
worded editorial in which similar
views are expressed. It is
discouraging to learn of this
response now to a plan that was
already sketched publicly in the
University Times in February and
that seems to be . receiving
overwhelming approval in the
present referendum of Senate
members. Itis also discouraging
that the Governance Committee
has received no direct communica-
tion from Student Government on
these matters.

The opposition centers on the
forthcoming introduction of a
Faculty Assembly, coequal with the
University Council. SGB and your

editorial ﬁnd it disturbing to have 4

an Assembly that is only for_ the
faculty.

May I assure you the Governance
Committeedid worry about main-
tenance of adequate student and
‘administration participation in the
Senate. It also worried that low
faculty participation is the most
deplorable weakness of the present
Senate. Creation of a small,
elected Faculty Assembly was
regarded as a device to remedy this
weakness. Under the compromise
we devised, students and faculty
will continue to meet in. Council
each month with the university
administration. Faculty‘ represen-
tatives will in addition meet
separately in the Assembly to talk
‘things over the formulate their own
thoughts. ~ .

To further understand the need
for the Assembly you must realize
that there is no existing university
body in which faculty meet by
themselves to— discuss institutional

questions. Student_leaders have
organizations like the Student
Government Board, in which they
meet without faculty intervention.
The administration has its organi-
'zations. Isn't it plausible that the
faculty should want as much?
Surely, the ‘vote in the present
referendum shows they do.

You suggest faculty bloc voting
might overwhelm the decisions in
future meetings of Council.

However, Council usually tries to‘

operate as a consensus body. What
might happen in the future is that
faculty input to the discussions
would be more carefully formula-
ted. Moreover, in judging the
votes in Council and in other
"Senate bodies, we must always
hear in mind that these votes

cannot be decisive; the Senate is an '

advisory organization.

Student‘ Government has ques-
tioned the role of the faculty. Isn’t
itifair for the faculty to have an
organization that can raise ques-
tions in return? ‘ '

than actual musical talent. It’s
image—macho, tough, black-
leather mutated rockers-—is ag-
gressively different, and would be
effective if the band's music was
not so criminally monotonous.

After its performance Monday,

night, it would be safe to say Blue
Oyster Cult likes to play
LOUDDDDI Its -members (Alan
Lanier, rhythm guitar and synthesi-
zers; Eric Bloom, vocals and stun
guitar; Buck Dharma, lead guitar;

‘Joe and Al Bouchard, bass guitar

and drums) tried to use overampli-
fied heavy metal-boogie and
stunning visuals (throbbing white
strobe lights, smoke bombs, etc.)
to wear down the audience. This is
standard strategy for tight, heavy
acts (Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple,
Black Sabbath) but can cause
numbing headaches when mishan-
dled by sloppy musicians such as
Blue Oyster Cult.

I Eric Bloom's vocals on “Flaming

' Telephaths,” “Dominance and

Sgbmission” and “M12262” were

nauseating growls, while Alan
Bouchard’s drumming was lacka-
daisical and amateurish throughout
the night. Buck Dharma is an
exciting, high energy guitar rocker
(blistering solos on “Cities on
Flame,” “Last Days of May” and
Steppenwolf’ s “Bom to be Wild”),
but not dominating enough to save
his group from the musical toilet.

, The second-billed act, Styx,
proved to be the star of the
evening. Forced to headline last
year at the Stanley Theatre (Queen
cancelled the day of the show), Styx
was unsure of itself, and, to put it
bluntly, choked. This time around,
new lead guitarist Tommy. Shaw (a
little blond pixie in musketeer.
boots) ﬁred the crowd with deft
guitar work and bouncy stage
antics. I-lis enthusiasm also has
given the other band members a
newly found stage conﬁdence,

reflected conclusively in the music. A

“Bom for Adventure,” .“Light
Up” and “22 Years” were
good-time rockers delivered with

joyous conviction on the part of the '

entire band. The ballads, “Sweet
Madame Blue” and “Lady,”
featured the crystal-clear (vocal

’band

J

harmonies of “keyboardist Dennis
De Young, guitarist Jim Young and
Shaw, while “Lorelai” and “Glory

Bound” were heavy-metal sweet-/

ened with Chicago streetblues.

Styx’s showpiece number is
“Midnight Ride,” a fast’boogie-
blues tune that exuded a bare-
knuckle, primal drive. Young
really came out of last year’s
introverted shell on this number,
engaging in a torrid, kamikaze-
intense guitar duel with Shaw.

Starcastle opened the show with
a set/ borrowed totally from the
work of Yes.. From the long-ﬂow-
ing, mystical stage apparel to the
lush vocal harmonies and synthesi-
zer-dominated sound, this Chicago
showed not one original
innovation.

Its best tunes, “Sunﬁeld” and
‘ ‘Lady of the Lake, ’ ’ were both long

, improvisations on a basic theme.’

Lead vocalist Gary Luttrel has a
high pitched, haunting style that
meshed effectively with ethereal
and complex instrumentation.
Althou,c._h,the members of Star-
castle are far from being clumsy

. thieves, carbon-copying will only

take them so far‘. ,

an innovative jazz-rock style
progress to even greater heights,’
impressing critics ‘and satisfying
fans without_ becoming repetitious
and predictable?
Yes. Return to Forever’s new"
release, Romantic Warrior, suc-
ceeas in transcending the group’s
past achievements with fresh and
original musical ideas. Like Chick
Corea’s recent solo effort, it is a
concept album loaded with musical
imagery. ' _ '
Return to Forever’s previous
albums were composed solely by
Corea, but Romantic Warrior
features pieces written by each
member of the band. This is a
positive step because,Al Dimeola
on guitar, Stanley Clarke on bass
and Lenny White on percussion
now have the" opportunity. to
contribute their own ideas.

 
   
   
   

Can a group that has developed

The album opens with "‘Medie-
val Overture,” an interesting
piece with some lightning-fast bass
playing by Clarke.

The title track, “The Romantic
Warrior,” begins with Corea and
Dimeola playing acoustic piano and
guitar, ‘respectively. Clarke adds an
acoustic bass to get the piece off
the ground. Like most of Corea’s
compositions, “The Romantic War-
rior” is built around a very simple

T71‘!

but potent theme. Dimeola start§:“f;f_

with some Latin-flavored guitar
licks, but yields to an energetic and
simply incredible piano solo by
Corea.

Dimeola’s guitarwork highlights
“Majestic Dance,” which is the
most enjoyable track on the album.
Dimeola is impressive with the
wide range of sounds he can put
out. “Majestic Dance” does more
than conﬁrm Dimeola as a top
notch guitarist; it also proves he is
a competent composer.

“Duel of the Jester and‘the
Tyrant” is very complex, contain-
ing elements of classical music.
Yet Corea manages to insert a little
comical motif that sounds 
something you would hear on a
Saturday morning cartoon show.

Romantic Warrior is Return to
Forever’s finest album. Composi-
tionally, the ‘group has matured
and technically, the sound of the
recording is excellent. On their
previous albums you could predict
the direction of the music, but
Romantic Warrior is full of
surprises that challenge the listen-

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

Recently, I saw the movie
“Rollerball” for the first time. I
was quite impressed and somewhat
startled, to say the least.

Impressed because of the game’s
make-up--men on skates and
motorcycles playing in a exhibition
where violence not only is legal,
but also encouraged. - r

And startled, because I couldn’t

/g-:4-:‘~1teep from asking myself the
“’ ‘unavoidable question--“Are we

really that far away from our very

own ‘Rollerball?’ ”

I mean, really, think about it.
After all, hockey players battle it
out with their sticks, objects which
were once used to steer the puck;
and baseball pitchers are taking
target practice at enemy hitters
instead of concentrating on throw-
ing strikes.

Though violence in sports goes
back a long time, the’ last six or
seven years has been a period of
escalation for brutality, lawless-

ness and bloodshed in sports.

An event occurring September
21, 1969 in Ottawa, Canada may
have kicked off this current trend of

.,/zzjxolence. That was the night Ted

t

 side of the net,-

c

féreen. then of the Boston Bruins.
literally had his skull split by
Wayne Maki, then with the St.
Louis ‘Blues. It was merely an
exhibition game.

Maki first speared Green at the
and Green
retaliated by. slapping Maki across
the shoulders with his stick before
skating away. The next thing
Green knew, he was lying
face-down on the ~ ice having
convulsions while the Blueswere

busy hustling Maki off the ice,.

trying to keep him from the Bruins.

Ironically, Maki died five years
later ofta brain tumor after being
acquitted in court, but was sus-
pended a mere 30 games for his
actions. Green, who was also
acquitted but was suspended for 13
games, needed a metal plate
installed to hold-‘his skull together,
but he eventually made a- come-
back. '

On January 4 of last year, Dave
Forbes of Boston dealt a similar
blow to Henry Boucha,‘ then with
the Minnesota North Stars, causing
a 25-stitch cut and double vision.
Assault charges were brought
against Forbes by the state of
Minnesota, but a hung jury
brought about a mistrial and

.l;~p-gubsequent acquittal for Forbes,

\-

who was punished, like Green and

Maki, by a meager league
suspension.

Then,» on November 5, Dan
Maloney of the Detroit Red Wings
allegedly struck Toronto’s Brian
Glennie with a stick, causing the
Leaf defenseman to suffer a slight
concussion and temporary am-

nesia. A Toronto Provinicial Court.

judge ruled Maloney must stand
trial on an assault charge.

Chances are, Maloney will be
acquitted
someone else will soon get
clobbered by a piece of lumber, if
not a baseball. -

Yes, baseball has joined in the
animosity. Several weeks ago, the
Mets and the Cardinals threw a
little beanball party, pushing the
subtle ‘sport of aseball one notch
up the ladder o a “Rollerball”
fate. Hockey h. ;a big head start.

The Cards’ L nn McGlothen hit
Met catcher Del Unser, then threw
behind John Matlack’s head before
also beaning him, apparently on
purpose. Unser had homered

previously in the game and, in

baseball jargon, “owns” Mc-
Glothen as a hitter.

Is that reason enough to bop a
man in the head with a baseball?
Or, in hockey,‘ is a hard check
grounds for retaliation with a
deadly weapon? Only in “Roller-
ball” should that be, but unless
something is done, we may see it
all come true,‘ and sooner than we
expect.

Currently, rules and punish-
ments in sports are too lenient to
deter violence. Maki should have
been barred from the NHL for life
and Green, though the victim, for

perhaps a year for taking the ﬁrst

swipe. ,

I’m not against a good old
ﬁstﬁght in hockey--in fact, I think it
is good for the game--but if a
dispute can’t be settled without the
raising ‘of sticks, then maybe we_

like the others and‘

Who AreThe- Pirates?

Z»

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

They have been called “The Lumber Company” by first-vear.Pirate
broadcaster Milo Hamilton, but the title just doesn't seem to ﬁt them
very well.

At least not when they encounter a good pitcher, as they did when

they met Gary Nolan of the Cincinnati Reds, who stopped the Bucs on , -

six hits Tuesday night. The Reds registered a 6-0 win, scoring three
runs in the first inning off Pirate starter Bruce Kison, and ended a Buc
winning streak at six. V ~

After winning their first five. games of the season, including a
two-game sweep of the Phillies in Veterans Stadium, (where,
incidentally, the Pirates had won only two games in the last two years)
there was some half-serious talk going around about the Eastern
Division race being decided by the All-Star break.

But the Pirates quickly laid any optimism to rest, and- on their
disasterous West coast excursion won only four of 13 games. Add to
that the timely ressurrection of the Phillies and the New York Mets
(New York winning 12 of their last 16), and the Pirates are suddenly in

‘ the soup. '

Would a change of venue, a return to Three Rivers, cure the early
season critics? The Lumber Co. was rejuvinated, and the Pirates came

. away with six straight wins.

Back in business, right?

Well, not exactly. .

Okay. They’re ﬁve games over the .500 mark right now. But with a
couple of games left in Cincinnati, and a weekend with the Los Angeles
Dodgers ahead of them, will they still be over .500 the middle of next
week?

You have to beat the big boys at their own game. That’s not pitching,
not hitting, and not defense. " '

It’s something called consistency.‘ The only thing the Pirates have

been consistent at is their continued inconsistency. Doc Medich, Jerry .
Reuss and Bruce Kison have looked superb this season—at times. Yet ‘
they now have a combined earned run average of close to 4.00. This is. *

especially evident in Reuss, whose 3.78 ERA belies his 4-2 won-lost
mark. In Tuesday night’s contest with the Reds, Kison (now 2-3) gave
up three earned runs without retiring a Cincinnati hitter. _ _ ' ‘ .
The Lumber Company isn’t without its good streaks and bad streaks
either. You have to be a little suspicious of a lineup many consider the
best in baseball that fold whenfaced with good pitching. Sure, they'll
go out and pound the Cubs 10-1 with 17 hits. But against the Nolans,

Seavers and Johns, they would do as well swinging the wrong end of . _ "
' the bat. _ I ‘ A‘ '

_When the playoffs come around, either the “Up and Down Gang”
will be on the way up, or they'll receive a pat on the back for being one
of the most ominous also-rans in baseball. -
