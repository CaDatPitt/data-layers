Settlement

BY BILL HADUCKL

Local 29. Pitt janitors, voted
yesterday to return to their jobs
today after a 12 day strike which
brought University maintainence to
a virtual standstill.

A settlement was reached Friday
afternoon between ‘Common Pleas
Judge Warren Watson, State
Mediator, and Union and Univer-

ﬂuisity negotiating teams, according

‘to Herman Foreman, union lawyer.

“It isn't 100 percent what we
strove for," Foreman said to a
crowd of about 300 union members
at Hotel Webster Hall, “but ‘we
think it shows a big gain.”

The new contract includes a 70
cent wage hike for the workers,
except those in Maintenance One,
mostly maids, over the next three
years. This is lower than the
union’s request of an 85 cent hike,

Advice Rendered
Free of Charge

A free, on-call service to answer
questions about ﬁling income-tax
returns begins at Pitt Monday,
February 4. sponsored by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and
the Legal Awareness Committee
(LAC) of Student Government.

The service, open to students,
members of the University com-
munity, and citizens of Oakland,
will be available Monday through
Friday, 11-2 pm in the Legal
Awareness office, 306 SU, and
Monday and Tuesday nights, 7-9
pm in the library of the University
and City Ministries [UACM]
building, Fifth and Bellefield.

Manned by approximately‘ 25
volunteers from the Legal Aware-
ness Committee, the Graduate
School of Business, and the Law
School, the service is one of many
Volunteer Income Tax Assistants
(VITA) programs conducted by the
IRS.

“We'll be manning the sites and
making ourselves available to
anyone in the University commun-
ity who needs help or wants help in
ﬁling his income tax." said Steve
Baer, LAC co-cltairperson.

“We’l| be able to answer inquiries
and to provide actual assistance in
filling out the forms if they’re
brought in.” Questions that the
volunteers cannot answer will be
referred to the Pittsburgh IRS
office.

To qualify for the service, the
volunteers were enrolled in a 12
hour course to learn the basics of
filing income-tax returns. Comple-
tion of the course certifies them as
volunteer tax assistants.

but higher than the University’s
initial offer of 65 cents. The raise
will be retroactive to January 1
when the old contractaexpired.
Anew pension plan will give the
workers an average of $125 a
month when they retire, replacing
the old plan which provided most
workers with only about $25., _
Other provisions call for a paid
lunch hour for the night shift,
eliminating two breaks, parents-in-
law included in bereavement pay,
and Martin Luther King day a paid
holiday. Foreman said, however,

"‘This will not be retroactive."

Union president David Glavin
blamed some of the

of support. “We started to fall
apart,” he said. “This made it
harder to get what we felt was a‘ fair
package.” ,

Some workers blamed last week's
injunctions limiting pickets and
permitting deliveries to cross
picket 2 lines for softening the
union’s demands. “We had them
going for a while," said one worker
at the meeting, “but when they
started letting the trucks in, we
weren't hurting them anymore. I
think if we could’ve kept everyone
out, we could’ve gotten another 15
cents. That judge, he almost
wrecked us.”

Union officials, however, were
grateful for the student support.
“If all the members gave the kind
of support the students did,”
Foreman said, “we could’ve even
came back with more.”

Although the new contract was
overwhelmingly accepted, 240-39,
there were some members irritated
by the fact that Maintenance One,
which is comprised mainly of
maids. will get only a 27 cent raise
the first year.

The third annual Women’s
Cultural Festival will be held
January 30 through February 2.

Festivities will commence at noon
opening daywith speaker Florynce
Kennedy, ‘founder of the National
Organization of Women [NOW].
Coffee hours will follow in the
Kurtzman Room, and the.events of
the afternoon will culminate in a
workshop for minority women.

In the evening, representatives of
various feminist groups in the area,
including NOW, the Women’s
Political Caucus and Pennsylvaians
for Women's Rights, will converge
in the Student Union to discuss the
Feminist Movement in Pittsburgh.

The following three days will
feature such personalities as
Sidney Abbott, co-author of Sappho
Was A Right-On Woman, Lolly and

Jeanne Hirsch, a medical mother-
daughter team, and Karen
Flaherty, a local pantomimist.
Events of unusual interest
include the Earth Onion W_omen’s
Theatre, a six-member Washing-
ton, DC group that will combine
improvisation and audience par-
ticipation to- illustrate theatre skills.
ln addition, films and workshops

of special interest to women will be .

available.

On Saturday the Earth Onions
Women's Theatre workshop will
begin at 11 am instead of 1 pm as
previously 'announced.- The pro-
gram contents will not be changed.

Union, Panhellenic Association,
and Gay Students at Pitt are
sponsoring the Festival, which is

exit through one of two gates on the
ground floor or the first floor of

properly checked "out, a door

metal bar at the exit will lock.

“We want to stress the positive

approach if someone is caught,”
Pam Vance, circulation department
head said. ‘‘If the alarm should go
off, we hope people will think of it
as a reminder--just come back and

‘Forum’ Person of Year

-A Pitt law student, Pat Miller,
has been selected “Person of the
Year” for 1973 by The Pittsburgh

' Forum, in recognition of her work

in abortion reform.

According to Tom Hennessy,
publisher of the Forum, Miller's
efforts helped lead to legalization
of abortion by the Supreme Court.

“She and another woman cam-
paigned for the nation’s first
abortion reform law in Colorado in
1967. Passage of that law created
the climate for the Supreme Court
ruling.”

The annual Forum award is given
to an individual in Pittsburgh who
has received little public recogni-
tion for positive contributions to the

/community.

Hennessy said, “Miller was
chosen primarily because "of the
impact of Women's Health Ser-
vices, lnc.. of which she was a
founder. This organization op-
erates an abortion clinic in
Pittsburgh, which has saved a lot of
women from the hardship of an
illegal abortion or of going to New
York for one."

Miller also engineered the Penn-
sylvania Abortion Coalition, a grass

roots campaign which spread into‘

other states.
Admitting that choosing an

abortion reformer as “Person of
the Year” is controversial, Hen-
nessy expressed surprise that the

Forum has not received any
complaints.

The new, system has been funded
by a $55,000 Hillman Foundation
grant and approved by the
University Senate Library Com-
mittee. Similar electronic devices
are now in operation at Temple and
Duquense Universities, and at
Carnegie-Mellon University. the
first in the nation.

“We plan to keep a log on
incidents that occur after the
system goes into effect," Rossell
said, “some of which may’ be
amusing. At CMU recently, a
Winchester-Thurston student got
caught by the detector and was so
nervous that the books fell right out
from her clothing."

The Environmental Action Club
has been recently formed at Pitt to
unite members of the University
interested in promoting and pre-
serving the environment. =
“There are plenty of environ-‘
mental groups in Pittsburgh,”
explained Club President Diane

Kearns, “but none on campus.

E30,’?

Smaller universities have them;

Pitt too, should have its own.
“Many students and faculty are

interested ._ in doing something

about the energy crisis, but they
don’t know where to go,” said
Kearns in further justification of a
campus-based organization.

The Club is presently applying for
ofﬁcial recognition by the Student

“ Caught” while testing the newisecurity system at Hillman

Government's Committee on Stu-
dent Organizations. Kearns is
hopeful that acceptance will be
soon:

“Optimistically, I think we'll be
approved by the end of this
month."

Recycling old newspapers is a
long-term project being considered
by the 50 members of Environ-
mental Action.

“This could be a major effort,
involving the whole University,”
Kearns said. “In fact. we hope to
work with the school as much as
possible in our projects. '

“For example, we are investi-
gating the possibility of working in
environmental radiation with our
advisor, Dr. Bernard Cohen, head
of the Nuclear Physics Lab."
The Club hopes to branch out into
as many areas of environmental
interest as possible, by working
with other universities, companies
such as US Steel and Westing-
house, and various environmental
groups, including Group Recycling
in Pennsylvania [GRIP] and Group
Against Smog and Pollution
[GASP].

“However, we want to stay
independent,” stated Kearns.
“That way we can both -help and be
helped by other organizations.”
Any member of the University
interested in the environment can
join the Environmental Action Club
at its next meeting on January 31, 6
pm in 524 SU. '

Student problem center

BY RITA VITOLO

A Little Help from Your Friends,
Pitt's student problem center.
recently announced plans to
become a little more help to their
friends.

Three new programs to increase
the problem center’s effectiveness
and broaden their influence among’
students are being considered,
Chairman Walt Wilson explained.

“The fact that we are a problem-

center," Wilson said, “means that
there are problems on campus that
somebody needs to reach.

“We think that everybody could
use us, even if they won’t admit it.
Everybody has problems that their
best friends don't want to hear, or
can’t help them with. We don’t say
that we are counselors. ,We’re
.people. We do say we'll talk about
anything."

Talking, Wilson said, is the
purpose behind A Little Help’s
“Lucy Booth” in the Student Union
Lobby. Presently on a trial run, the
free booth, open from 9 am until 4
pm will ‘alternate among the

‘ Cathedral, Towers, and SU lobby.

A coffeehouse in the old Bimbo’s
building with Student Health and
the Counseling Center is planned,
but not" definite as yet.

Describing the coffeehouse as
“different than the usual, not like
the one in the Union
weekends,” W_ilson explained that
the atmosphere will be “small, and

OI1_

very informal," with a priority on
conversation.

Intensified training sessions for
the 23 volunteers remains at the‘
heart of the program however.
Following an initial week’s training
period, the group conducts weekly
training sessions involving role-
playing skits and sensitivity ex-

e/p’

ercises, and continual update and
revision of the referrals list.

The referrals list operates as a
second source in A Little Help’s
outreach _to students. Calls or
problemsithat require more than
conversation are referred to a
professional source, among them

Archeologists' Dreoms

BY MATTHEW KAMBIC

Somewhere within every bud-
ding archeologist is the dream to
partake in a dig--to put to practical
use the knowledge he has been
accumulating through years of
study. Two Pitt graduate students
received that chance last De-
cember.

Bob Maslowski and Joel Gunn,
along with assistant professor
James Adovasio from Pitt and Dr.
G. F. Fry from Youngstown State
Universitv. =traveled to western
Cyprus to research the prehistoric
settlement patterns of the Khrys-
okhou river drainage system.

“This was the second trip in a
long term research project,” said
Adovasio. “The dig before this
was funded by grants from the
Center for International Studies,

Of Digging Come True

the Research Council from
Youngstown State University, and
the National Georgraphic Society.”

The National Geographic Society
contributed most of this year’s
funding and will handle the full
cost in a planned return this
December.

An added incentive for the group
was that this area had never been
surveyed before, except for the one
month expedition the previous year
by Adovasio and Fry. Before last
year the country was off limits to
archeological investigation because
of political turmoil between the
Greek and Turkish halves of the

‘ country.

“There -are UN troops all over the
island," Adovasio commented,

“Neverther1ess," he stated, “we
haven't let controversy stand in our
way in the past."

Miller, a first-year Pitt law
student, feels there is still much
work to be done in birth control,
even though the issue of abortion
as 3. legal right is over.

“Improvements must be made in
contraceptives, and there is a

terrible lack ofiknowledge and '-

information on birth control," she

explained.
“Organizations like Women's

overcome these problems by
offering contraceptive information,

“Unfortunately,’ she continued,

I ﬁnd myself wanting to say
something new about it, but quite
unable to express myself in other

for ads encouraging motorists to

You no doubt have gotten the
message--and so far I've only
discussed the substitution of the
word “fuel" for “fool."

Who's to tell where the shortage
will lead our already debauched
American language.

One foreign car manufacturer was
so brazen as to buy billboards
which call every other new car “a

lt’s enough to make one get down

have done a ﬁne job of reporting
the elections. especially in regard
to the candidate interviews.

that I appreciate very much what
you have done to revive some type
of interest in the Student Govern-
ment. I really think that this new
SG Board should try to work closely
with the Pitt News in hopes that
more fields of interest are
developed among the students. If
the 3rd and 4th floors work in
cooperation with each other, the
students of this campus will be
better served.

Indeed. service for the students of
this University is the main goal of
both groups. To work in
cooperation will assure that each
will attain this goal.

Strike Support Committee

In Retrospect

The settlement of the Pitt strike
represents a victory for Local 29
and its supporters. The Admini-
stration made concessions on
pensions, wages, and retroactivity
only after it was clear that
injunctions could not break the
strike and that large numbers of
students and faculty were siding
with the workers.

However, this strike has taught
students and workers bitter lessons
about what to expect from the
Administration. We have seen the
University hire a notorious union-
busting law firm to procure
iniunctions denying the right to
strike. We have seen strikers fired
in the course of “bargaining,” and
we have seen scabs hired.

The Administration has resorted
to almost every dirty trick in the
book to deny justice and dignity to
some of the lowest paid, hardest-
working, most oppressed people in
our community.‘ Even after
conceding a 30 cents an hour raise.
in wages, Pitt granted the lower
paid job classifications, mainly

women, only 27 cents. This
accentuates the wage differential
between men and'women workers,
rather than granting equal pay for

‘equal work as demanded by the

Union. I

The gains won by Local 29, after
almost two weeks on the picket-
lines without any strike-pay, are a
step forward for these workers, and
for all workers and students on this
campus, whether‘ organized or not
yet organized. This settlement will

 Study Abroad Considers

Limited Student Budgets

BY DAVE MAJ ERNIK
Studying abroad does not have to

be expensive, according to ofﬁcials _

of the University of Pittsburgh
program in France. This program
arranged with the University of

Rouen in France is now in its sixth

year and has provided foreign
" study experience for 40 to 50
students a year.
According to next year’s director,
Dr. Aaron Sheon, associate profes-
sor in Pitt’s fine arts department,
the program costs students the
average room and board and tuition
at Pitt per term, plus $160, plus
transportation. About $400 to
$500 spending money is also
necessary. “Students who think
they cannot afford to study abroad
can now do so,” said Sheen.
Covered by the fees are free
room and board with a French
family, free meals, free busfare to
and from school, and about three
; days of major excursions. Students
may choose to stay for one or two
terms. ‘
Admission requirements to the
program include a B average and
the equivalent of three terms of
French. Applicants need not be
French majors or even students at
Pitt. According to last year’s
director, Dr. Philip Koch, 25 to 30
-.per cent’ of the students formerly
enrolled in the program have come
from other schools such as UCLA,
Northwestern, Mount Holyoke, and
Grove City College.
“The courses at Rouen are
specifically designed for Pitt's

program and according to Pitt’s_

speciﬁcations," said Koch, “be-
cause regular courses at the
University last all year.”

The schedule for students in the
Pitt program consists of an
intensive six-credit course in
French grammer and composition,
one or two electives dealing with
topics in French art or history. and
an introductory course on French
culture taught by the program
director. Besides the introductory
course. all other courses are taught
in French by professors from the
University of Rouen.

According to Koch, living with a

French family is an important part‘

of the program. “We carefully
choose families who want to share
their French experience. Students
usually have their own bedroom,
have dinner with their family, and
go on outings with their family.
Often students refer to the husband
and wife of their family as ‘mother’
and ‘father’." he said.

Rouen, a city about half the size’

of Pittsburgh situated in Nor-
mandy, is about an hour and a half

drive from Paris and six hours from -

London. Course work for students
in the program ends at noon on
Thursday to encourage them to use
the long weekend for travel.
Sheen explained that his job as
director will be to help students

(From Handbook on Abortion)
SUCTION ABORTION AT 10 WEEKS—Over 75% of all
abortions in the U.S. and Canada are done by this meth-
od. It is like the D&C except that a powerful suction tube
is inserted. This tears apart the body of the developing
baby and his placenta, sucking the “products of pregnan-
cy” into a jar. Sometimes the smaller body parts are
recognizable as on this pictur_e. Not only does this pic-
ture have emotional impact, it is worth 10,000 words . . .
for it also stimulates response of the perceptual-cogni-
tivesystem to override cognitive dissonance that abor- .
tionists tend to suffer from. Looks like a real baby? May-

On Tuesday, Jan. 29, noon-2 p.m. in the Lower Lounge of the Student Union, there will be an SHL-I
sponsored seminar: “Women’s Rights and Positive Solutions for Distressed Pregnancies.” Please
attend. It’ll be interesting.

“Never take foolishness too seriously,” says a Chinese proverb.

Do not be conned by the abortionists that abortion is the only way. Every woman has the right to:
rediscover the true nature and value of a human being; realize the privilege and responsibility it is E
to share in the creation of new life; appreciate, love and sacrifice for the unborn child who carries
part of her with her or him; see abortion only as a symptomatic solution for reaching an answer to_ i
distressing socio-economic problems; adequate pregnancy counseling, doctor’s support and help
from the community; decent housing and living standards so she may bring her children up in dig-
nity; adequate facilities for educating and treating her child if born handicapped; humane adoption
procedures if she chooses to give up her child for whatever reason; respectful wedlock; safe ’
streets without fear of molestations.

We ask the academic community, “Why Not?” When some ask, “Why?” Should the unborn child be
-  allowed to fulfill a destiny—even if it means a little sacrifice! ! !

Lack/of worker support was one
of many complaints aired by
 striking members of union Local
29. at various locations on the Pitt
“campus. Saturday afternoon.
“There is a lackadaisical attitude
. among those strikers who have
i another job,” said one picket who
,'wished to remain unidentiﬁed.
,“The‘strike is only of secondary
_i importance to them, and they're
-not turning out for picket duty. -
1, {They're ready to go back to work
-,for a nickel raise.”
 Pickets also criticized their
negotiators for failing to set a date
for early contract talks. Their
7 previous contract expired Decem-
‘ber 31. ‘

University wasn't laid in earlier
years.”

Other pickets said they had lost
respect for the administration since
the strike.

“How can you respect people
like Dutton and Hannan (Vice-
Chancellor of Operations and
director of Employee Relations
respectively) with reputations as
anti-union to begin with, when they
tell you, in effect, ‘This is our
position, if you don’t like it,
tough,~”’ said a striking grounds-
man.

“If it wasn't for student and
faculty support they'd never settle
with us,” said another striker.

‘Among speciﬁc grievances was
the complaint of a store keeper

' /1

  
  

“When a bill is due, a person
doesn't wait until he has to pay a
penalty before he pays the bill,”
said another picket. “I can’t
understand why the groundwork
\-.,for negotiating a contract with the

  

   
  

  

 

receiver. one who inspects parcels
after they are removed from
delivery trucks.

“Although I'm technically a
store keeper receiver. my super-
VISOI‘ uses me as a mover, which
involves moving furniture around
the University. -

“But I don’t receive the mover’s _.

rate of pay, only that of store
keeper receiver. Now, if I’m going
to be paid at. this rate, why must _I
do moving jobs’ which'call for a
higher rate of pay?

“Also, as a mover, I must ride
around in an open truck. No foul
weather gear is provided. as was
called for in our last contract. All I
know is the administration must
not be budgeting its money
properly."

-Workers mentioned the use by
the University of open contracts
with repairmen and contractors,
which call for them tobe paid every
time something is repaired, no
matter how many times the same

job must be done.

“There’s been a leak in the roof
of Trees Hall since 1960,” said one
striker. “It's been patched up
frequently but only since last
January have any major repairs
been instituted. If the job had been
done properly in the beginning, the
University would not have had to
waste this additional money.

“Then the administration won-
ders where the money goes, and
decides to take up the‘ slack by
laying people off, like the 44
janitors laid off last spring. They
were never rehired. The remaining
workers had to take over their jobs
as well as do their own.

Alternatives to US field work

BY LARRY PANSINO

Expanding overseas opportuni-
ties for health profession students
is the major goal of a new
organization being formed by ten
students with such interests.

The Committee for International
Health Opportunities (CIHO) wants
to develop a field experience

alternative’ to fulﬁlling the field

to the organization's publicity
director Phillip Parr. ’

CIHO is composed of graduate
and undergraduate students in the
schools of the health professions.
They will have their first open
meeting Tuesday at 7 pm in the
Graduate School of Public Health
auditorium.

believe that by organizing and

official recognition as an organiza-

Igus and Kearney —-SRO ‘F

BY CHUCK BRAVERMAN

The first Coffee House of the
term has just ended with probably
the- biggest crowds of the year,
excepting Chis Rush’s one night
appearance last November,
possibly equaling that nights
attendance on Saturday night.

Darrow Igus has to be part of the
reason for such a large turnout,
along with Eileen Kearney who has
been on the bill since Thursday
night. Darrow Igus has come a
long way since his appearance here
last March, going on to become a
regular on CBS Rollout and
probably every up-and-coming
young comic’s dream of a guest
shot on Johnny Carson, happening
just two weeks ago for Darrow.
Just for the record, he never saw

I

' Carson, except on stage where he

looked the same as he does from
the other side of the TV screen.
Darrows’ comedy is as visual as
it is funny. Darrow considers
himself an actor, being trained in
acting, and well practiced in
pantomime, both which are parts of
his act. One of Darrow’s pieces
involved a ghetto bus driver in
Newark who doesn’t want to pick
up any junkies, beautifully mimed
by Darrow as it gives you the
feeling that he really is driving that
bus. Darrow again shows his body
control as we see Douglas
Fairbanks, Sr. being projected at
the slightly faster than normal 24
frames per second instead‘ of the

normal silent film speed of 16
frames per second. Performed on
Carson, Darrow has a routine that
has to be a classic demonstration in
slow motion instant replay as
Bronco Grabowski gets his jock
knocked off. Darrow beautifully
portrays both the quarterback and
the receiver Grabowski as he goes
through the pass play in slow
motion.

Darrow is an extremely capable
impressionist with a good ear for
street talk. Darrow’s impressions
are generally put into the context of
a situation «looked at for the
absurdity. “Walter Brennan
sounds like he is lifting weights”
proclaims Darrow as he slips into a
weight lifter’s crouch, holding an
imaginary bar bell and as he rises
gives us a beautiful rendition of
Walter Brennan saying, “This
damn thing is too heavy.” .

The master returns home from
the Civil War and is traced through
the past forty years in film. The
master is greeted by Step and
Fetch it, Sidney Poitier, and
Superfly all perfectly created by
Darrow, with a perfect Sidney
Poitier right out of Guess Who’s
Coming to Dinner.

Darrow portrays excellently the
acting that goes on in a courtroom.
Darrow sets the mood--a white
lawyer, a Black jury, a Black
judge--', “surrounded by dark-
ness.” The lawyer’s client is being
tried for rape. The lawyer works

himself into a frenzy delivering fire

and brimstone and a little smoke

from his ears as he sums up his
case for the jury.

Opening the extremely strong
bill was Ellen Kearney, accom-
panied by Don Sarlin. Ellen
opened her set with the light and
bouncy Hank Snow tune, “Cuban
Rumba”, which immediately dis-
played Ellen’s vocal talent as well
as the improvisational techniques
of her accompariiest Don Sarlin on
the electric guitar. Ellen managed
to captivate the audience with her
strong and clear voice moving from
her own compositions to notable

,tunes from other songwriters.

Ellen adds an interesting interpre-
tation to “Jamaica Farewell”, a
tune- performed’ by- Harry Bela-
fonte. Some tunes of merit that
stand out are her reditions of
“Midnight at the Oasis”, and her
own compositions, “Earl’s Crab
Shack”, “Can Someone Tell Me
Where a Good Man Can Be
Found”, “A Long Time”, and a

collaboration with her accom- -

paniest to produce “The Lullaby.”

The audience, being most
receptive, demanded an encore and
brought Ellen to the stage alone,
with just her guitar for moral
support and delivered a touching
song, “O Universe”, a cappella,
and left everyone mellow and
happy, leaving good thoughts of
the talents of Ellen Kearney and

Matmen Devour

Mounties 39-3  

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Morgantown, West Virginia--
Before you could spell Morgan-
town, George Bryant, Pitt’s 118
pound wrestler, set the tempo for
the Panthers most impressive
performance of the year Saturday
afternoon--and what a tempo it
was! ‘

With the slippery Washington
(Pa.) junior hinting the way. Dave
Adams’ grapplers registered wins
in nine of ten bouts. on way to a
39-3 shellacking. Bryant. who has
won all four of his matches since
returning to the team after a term
of academic ineligibility, zoomed to
a 16-1 lead, and though failing to
cop a pin. settled for a 19-4
superior decision over Mountie
Rick Pennis.

It was only the third win of the
season for the Pitt matmen, but
after rubbing shoulders with the
nation's top grap teams and having
them pinned with defeat, the
outclassed Mountaineers were a
welcome break.

“I think because we’ve wrestled
teams like Oklahoma, Michigan,
Michigan State, Oregon State
(twice) and Lehigh,” Adams noted,
“that it's beginning to pay off for
us now.
better condition for this match than
they were and the thing that
impressed me the most was the
way we looked out there. We were
agressive.”

Agressive was not the word to
describe the action. It was
devistating. The Mountaineers
were unable to score a takedown in
the first three matches and only
registered seven all afternoon. Pitt
on the other hand amassed 17.
And, the Cats also enjoyed the

We were definently in.

luxury of three consecutive pins in
the 158. 167. and 177 weight
classes.

Rande Stottlemyer decisioned
Craig Hilligass 6-3 at 126 pounds
for his ninth win in 12 bouts and
Bob Bailey (5-7) made a shambles
at 134 by breezing 15-3. But at 142
and 150. Adams was really happy.

Jeff Weis and freshman Bob
Kebr both registered the first Pitt
win in those weight classes for the
season. Both Weis and Kebr fell
behind early in their matches but
came back to win. Weis
deciosioned Len Wrabel 18-4 and
Kebi-’s reversal in the closing
minute put him on top of Tom
Oleszewski 7-5.

Ra-y Dallatore (158) made it six in
a row by pinning Garrett Breaking-
ton at 2:12 of the second period.
Dallatore’s win seemed to set a
different pace. Everyone was

going for the pin now. Wally
Morrell and Pual Jazenski suc-
ceeded. Morrell registered his

fourth consecutive win, by falling
Dave Hines at 1:31 in the third
period and Jazenski. subbing for
injured Jeff Minerd, copped his at
1:16 in the third.

John Achenbach was the only
Panther to taste defeat." but
considering the fact that John was
wrestling his first match in four
years--he hasn't wrestled since

high school--the 10-7 win by Dave A

Snyder wasn't /that impressive.

Carl Roba put the finishing

touches on the slaughter by beating
Frank Zatta 10-3.

Pickings might not be so easy
this Wednesday night. The
Panthers meet Clarion 18-2 and

ranked in the top ten.

The rules of basketball state that
only five men may play at any one
time. When Buzz Ridl says he has
nine starters. opposing coaches
know all too well what he means.
Ridl used his nine starters well
yesterday. as the Panthers routed
Penn State at the Field House,
83-61.

Pitt rolled to its 15th straight
victory in a game in which the
officials did not let many fouls go‘
uncalled. What resulted was
players from both teams getting
into early foul trouble. forcing
Ridl and PSU coach Johnny Bach to
go to their benches.

Ridl found it much easier to go to
his bench than Bach did his. With
players like Lew Hill, Willie Kelly.
and Keith Starr waiting to go in,
it's no wonder Ridl doesn't
hesitate to use them.

When foul trouble set in, it was
the big gun that had to sit down.
How well they could be replaced
decided the outcome of the game.

Pitt had built up a 34-26 lead when
Billy Knight picked up his third
personal foul with 4:34 remaining
in the first half. Willie Kelly, who
had performed so well against
Virginia in a similar role. came in
for Knight and scored on a twisting
layup that g.. e Pitt a 37-27 lead.

Kelly scored as ' oefore the half
ended. and Pitt left for the locker

"Banner’s Babies”, Grind   
Opponents At Invitational 1

BY RICK STOUFFER

Picture in your mind a huge meat
grinder, you know, the kind you
stick whole pieces of meat in the
top and it comes out in hundreds of
little ones? Keep this in mind
because the Pitt Tracksters did just
this to all competition at their track
invitational over the weekend.

“Banner's Babies” as they call
themselves outclassed all competi-
tion by huge margins including
highly rated Maryland and Navy.
For example. Pitt took eight firsts’
out of a possible 17 plus four
seconds and one third meaning
they placed in a remarkable 13 out,
of 17 events.

Although no team total for points
was kept because some schools
sent only their top athletes. by
referring to the well-known Stouf-
fer Method of Classing Events
(giving five points for a first place

ﬁnish. three to a second, and one to

a third)’ Pitt's overall. -dominance
shows through. The Panthers
collected 53.’ points while _the
nearest competitor, Maryland had
23 followed’ by Navy with 20, West

College with 12, Williamand Mary"
with 8, Bucknell with-,3,

and

a. pm... Roar   1. 1 5.. Straight

room with a 45-31 lead.

Penn State was also having its
problems with fouls. Ron Brown
picked up three personals before
the game was eight minutes old.
Randy Meister, 6-9 center who
dominated the boards when he was
in the game, also picked up three
fouls in the first half. ‘

Many players started the second
half hesitant to make body contact,
for fear of a foul call. The fouls
Came anyhow.

Knight picked up his fourth when
he was called for reaching over a
Nittany Lion on a rebound attempt.
He took a rest with 19 minutes
remaining in the game.

Meister got called for his fourth
foul when attempting to stop Jim
Bolla, who was driving up the lane.
Bach did not remove Meister, and
the Baldwinsville, NY junior fouled
out a minute later.

With three of his starting five in
foul trouble the entire second half,
Bach had to either substitute a lot
or play a loose game. He tried
both, but neither worked.

Penn State did manageto cut the
lead to ten at one point. 55-45. but
Knight returned to the lineup, and

-Pitt widened the lead again.
Knight played very intelligently,
knowing that he had four fouls. and
he didn't get himself into any
situations that even came close to
resulting in a foul. “Mooney" left
the game with 2:12 left in the
game, not because of a foul, but
because Ridl was clearing his
bench.

“Only a very good. poised team
can beat Pitt." said Bach outside
the losers'ﬂ locker room. “They
have a good depth."

Bach was critical of the officials, «

but didn't blame them for the loss.
“We didn't lose because of fatigue.
because of the officials. or because
of the homecourt advantage." he

The combination of rebounding
strength and fast breaks resulted in
the Cubs‘ lopsided victory.

Coach Webster attributed the
victory to his plaryers’ quickness to
learn. “We’ve been teaching them
the Varsity's defense." he stated,
“and they are really catching on
quickly."

Webster cited the fine rebound-
ing of Frank Boyd as a factor in the
victory. “He’s only 6-2,” stated
Webster, “and he pulled down 14
rebounds against the much bigger
men. ,

“Another factor was the fine
shooting of Haygood. He is losing
his football muscles. He's been
tight. but tonight he shot 10 for 16
and was our high scorer."

don’t like to set the pace. It's
better for me if I relax with
somebody else ahead of me. I did
want to break two minutes and
thirteen seconds (he ran almost a
second faster) so I have to say I’m
satisfied.”

Commenting on the two-mile
relay which he anchored, Rich
wasn’t as happy. “Our seven
minutes fifty-one seconds is not
near what we can do. Three of our
guys had run races before so we
weren’t fresh. _When we’re fresh,
we can really rip. I guess today we
were just running to win.”

"Competition wasn't as stiff
today as I though it would be,”
Markley continued, ‘‘I know we can
do better with more competition.”

High jumpers are a funny breed.
Not many people like the idea of
throwing themselves over a stick
higher than they are tall. Tim Riley
is one of the few. He also was the
outstanding ﬁeld event man of the
meet.

(Country, urbanor suburban living, whichever
you prefer. Phillipsburg is an attractive suburban
community located in West Jersey on the
Delaware River.)

An Equal Opportunity Employer, M/F

parents, an excited Tim talked of
his record-breaking leap. “lt’s the
realization of a dream. I guess it's
like a runner breaking the four
minute mile. Ever since I was a
sophomore in high school I
dreamed of jumping seven feet.
Now that I've done it, I think I can
go higher. I have to work on
consistency. After all there are a
lot of seven foot high-jumpers in
the US."

When asked if he had prepared
in any special way for the invite
Tim laughed.) “This was a lousy
week. I had a sprained ankle all
week and then Thursday I got the
flu. Friday I couldn’t get out of
bed. Even though I looked really
bad on Thursday, coach kept my
confidence up so it wouldn’t
brother me. I have to say my
success comes from him.”

With all success there has to be a
little failure, with Andre Harris
being the unlucky one. Having tied
the school record against Kent
State in the high hurdles, Andre
was expected to break the record
easily.

During warmup he felt his left
hamstring, which had kept him out
of competition last year, give a
pull. Gradually the pain got worse
with two false starts only adding to
it. Even with the pain Harris ran a
6.3. As he said, “I could have won
it. But don’t worry, I’ll do it next
time.”

Coach Smittie Brown knows the
pressure of a big meat, having run
in the invitational himself. Smittie
was the all around coordinator of
the meet, running around, icon-
stantly organizing the jumble of
track men. Very tired but still
smiling, Brown spoke on the invite.
“I have to say it was a good meet.
This invitational gives some of the
small schools their first chance to

run indoors so it was a big help for
them. Our guys did a good job. I
can't say enough. about Riley, he's
just tremendous."

“We did have a few bad
breaks,” Smittie continued,
“Andre getting hurt in the hurdles
was one of them. Then our mile
relay team, losing to West Virginia,

was another. Both teams are really

tough and if our boys had been
fresh (three out of four had run
before), the end would have been
different.”

Competition came, competition
went. It didn’t matter. Banner’s
Babies keep grinding away.

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
There weren't any fights--you

can thank the new league rules for
that. but it really didn't matter to_
the Pitt Hockey Club as it left the
Civic Arena yesterday with a 4-0
victory over the usually rowdy
Duquesne Dukes.

The new ﬁghting rules make
dropping the sticks and gloves
rather costly to any willing
participants; if two players fight,
they're out for that game and if the
fisticuffs take place in the last
period a game suspension is tacked
onto that game misconduct.
Anybody leaving the bench to fight
is automatically suspended for one
calendar year.

Those rules went into effect in
January and since there haven't
been any major infractions. as was
the case in the Pitt-Duke en-
counter. But that didn’t mean that
the spirit wasn't there. The Pitt
skaters knew what had to be
accomplished and they also knew
that they couldn’t break any rules
in accomplishing it. So it was play
the man and not the puck.
especially when the puck carrier
happened to be the Duke’s best
offensive threat, defenseman C. H.
Bender.

Bender took body checks from just
about all of the Pitt skaters as Pitt
coach Len Barcawlo smiled from
the bench, watching his strategy
pay off. And while the Dukes
fumbled around trying to mount an
attack, Pitt took a first period 3-0
lead.

Duquesne goalie Fred Wolkowitz
should have been around for the
initial fifteen minutes. He missed
most of the goals. Glenn Hyde
boomed a drive from outside the
blue line that fooled Wolkowitz to
start the scoring and it didn't take
long for the lead to grow.

Joe Testa beat Wolkowitz on the

behind C-MU.

backhand as Pitt had the man
advantage and Greg “Mad Dog"
Mintz put in the rebound of a Kerry
Browne drive to complete the first
period scoring.

'Pitt outshot the Dukes 30-26
overall but most of the Duquesne
shots were long attempts at setting
up possible rebound opportunities.
Pitt goalie John DeFazio made the
save of the game in the third period
when Tim Boylan took a pass at the
blue line and walked in alone on the
Panther nets. _

DeFazio came out a few feet in
front of the crease and just got the
right skate out in time to make the
save on a shot headed for the low
corner. _

Pitt's third goal came ‘on a
picture-perfect passing play from

Hyde to Denny Browne to Charly
Hagins at the start of the ﬁnal
period. Hyde picked up the p'uck at
his own blue line and broke out
three on one with his teammates.
Browne took it on the left wing at
the Duquesne blue stripe and fed it
to Hagin, who cruised in on right
wing and fired the rubber past
Wolkowitz.

The win keeps Pitt in second
place, four points behind Camegie-
Mellon with a game in hand over
the Tartans. Pitt will try to narrow
the margin tonight at the Kirk

prises at all." said Coach Brad-
Shaw. (‘we intended to win. but we

didn't think it would be this easy."

The Pitt tankers took ten out of
thirteen first places in the meet,
setting three new Temple pool
records and one Pitt team record.
Mike Lowler was the only Owl
swimmer to grab a first place as he
won both the 100 and 200-yard
freestyle. while his team was able
to take the 400-yard freestyle relay.

The meet was an experiment for
Bradshaw who tried to find some
new spots for some of the
swimmers on the team. Eric
Wallace was switched over to the
200-yard breaststroke from the
number two spot in the individual
medley and picked up second place
behind John Templin.

Jerry DeMuro only swam in one
distance event. the 500. and set a
new Temple pool record while Walt
Young swam in the other distance
event and also set a new Temple

set a pool record by going 5S.7:in

relay.

this one.

upset the Temple team last year
and the Owls were after some};

revenge. but were only to be

denied as the Panthers poured it on
and-. did not allow the Temple

tankers to even come close.

\‘9‘Our team has come a long way,

in one year,” said Bradshaw.

“Last year Temple faced the '
nucleus of our rebuilding program, 

and this season came up against
the‘ finished product. I didn’t

expect the team to come into its _

own so soon.”

found that Hector Bas actually took
third.

Fatyol came back in the
three-meter event to take first
place with Hector Bas a close
second and Jack Garrow picking up
thirds place. Carlos Santiago and
Mark Wallace continued their
winning ways in the 200-yard
backstroke as the swimmers have
provided the team with the needed
one-two punch in the event.
Santiago won the event while
Wallace came in second.

“Mark is swimming the 200-yard
backstroke a lot better now,” said
Bradshaw. “He has Santiago
helping him, plus the fact that he is
in better shape now than he was at

this time last season, as" is almost
the whole team.”

The Panthers simply over-
powered the Temple squad and are
looking for more victories in the
future, but they have a very tough
meet coming up this weekend
against Maryland, who could very
well be the best team in the East.

According to Bradshaw, that's
what the Temple meet was about.
He wanted to ﬁnd out how ‘he could
divide his swimmers so that he
could get the most he could out of
them and he thinks he's found how
he's going to swim it.

He must have done something
right as Mark Wallace won the 50
yard free-style and John Schepner
grabbed second place.

Gymnasts 3rd  

The Pitt Gymnastics team
found the -going a little rough
Saturday afternoon as they finished
third in their Tri-Meet with Temple
and Slippery Rock, at Trees Hall
Gym.

Behind sparkling performances

‘by Bob Kovic (50.80) and Tom

Cuyjet (49.05) the Temple Owls
streaked to first place by amassing
an- excellent 156.15 points. Kovic
and Cuyjet, both all-around men,
took first and second place
respectively in the all-around
parade. I

Slippery Rock, though copping
only a fourth in the All-Around
(Sam Matz--44.95) was supplied by

more consistent scores in every

event on way to their 142.55 team '

points.

Pitt’s Rob Pasterick managed a
third in the all-around scoring Gus
Papantonio was fifth (36.30) to
provide the Cats with the bulk of
their score. Don Stevenson,
though injured and unable to
compete in all the all-around
events, still managed to finish
ahead of a couple of Slippery Rock
participants to place seventh
(29.15).
