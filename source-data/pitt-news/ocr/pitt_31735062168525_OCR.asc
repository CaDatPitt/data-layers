b The Presidents’ Council is another innovation pro-
 vided for by the Constitution which is full of poten-
tial. The Council includes presidents of 11 major cam-
pus organizations. The simple coming together of
these leaders for purposes of discussion is of little im-

to organizing and better articulating student views
when actions are about to be taken.

days would be‘ if students simply don’t bother to vote.
Because the balloting places strategically situated

Hopes for ‘More Effective’ SG gs
Hinge on ‘Yes’ Mandate — Hyman, as

by DAN BOOKER

A student referendum tomor-
row and Wednesday will deter-
mine whether a year of planning
and drafting a constitution for
“more effective” student govern-
ment will, ‘in fact, achieve its
purpose. The referendum must
be an overwhelming mandate, if
ﬁnal approval is to be granted
the new constitution by the ad-
ministration, says Terry Hyman,
chairman, of the constitution com-
mittee.

The necessity for strong stu-
dent support of the new docu-
ment has been emphasized often
by Student Government (SG)
President Ralph Marming. Man-
ning has urged the SG senators
to spend as much time as pos-

sible to get students out to vote.
The SG president has said re-
peatedly that the overal objec-
tive of real student involvement
in student affairs can be accom-
plished only if the constitution
receives a mandate.

Voting booths will be located
in the Student Union, Cathedral,
Towers Lobby, and Engineering
Hall and will be open from 10
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. In order to vote,
students must present their ID
cards. Graduate and undergrad-
uate students may participate in
the referendum.

After the referendum, Dean of
Student Affairs Helen Rush, as
the representative of the Board
of Trustees, must grant approval
if the constitution is to become

D Phi E To Reactivate
With 25 New Pledges

by BERNIE McLEOD
Twenty-ﬁve University
women, interested in shap-
ing a new group, have be-

come the Eta chapter pledge

colonoy of Delta Phi Epsilon
sorority.

Each of the new pledges was
interviewed last week by either
Mrs. Howard G. Rossner, the so-
rodity’s national executive direc-
tor, or Mrs. Loren A. Spero, the
new, international president. They
received their bids Wednesday
evening. , ,

“While discussing D Phi E with
the girls,” said Mrs. Rossner, “We

listened for people with creative

ideas: Creativity plus hard work
are most important in organizing
this group.”

The Eta chapter is presently
considered a pledge chapter, and‘
must" wait six weeks before it
receives permanent recognition
from the national organization.
All of its members, now pledging

the chapter, will be installed as ‘

full sorority members before
Christmas.

Mrs. Peter Morris, regional di-
rector for D Phi E, will direct the

girls during their pledge period.
In. addition, Joanne Friedman, a
junior at the University and a D
Phi E: transfer from Ohio State,
will serve as pledge mother for
the - group.

For the first year, the sorority‘

will use one, of the University
rooms for their weekly meetings.
As of next fall, they hope to get
a suite in Amos Hall. A
New pledges include: Sambra
Bayer, Ilene Bergsman, Roberta
Block, Adrienne Chern, Ronna

dp Mail Can Now Be Distributed  

Mail room policy has been al-
tered by Office Services in order
to permit recognized student or-
ganizations to distribute bulk lit-
erature to men and women dor-
mitory residents via the mail-
boxes without having to specifi-
cally address it. -

Previously, all mail had to be-

addressed to each dorm. resident

Now, an organization must only

The impetus , for the policy
change came from the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee,

which met Thursday and’ voted _

to‘ recommend the new procedure
to Office Services.

Commenting on the policy
change, Men's Dormitory Coun-

Biological and Chemical Warfare
- In Vietnam Called ‘Genocide’ Here

Is a University justiﬁed in ac-
cepting contracts to “develop sys-
tems of genocide?” This was the
question that Robin Meisel, speak-
ing to Students for Peace (SFP),
asked last Friday afternoon.

Meisel is a member of the
Philadelphia Area Committee to
End the War in Vietnam and-
was a participant in the germ
warfare controversy that occur-
red last year at the University of
Pennsylvania. The controversy
began when Meisel, delivering

~ books to the Institute of Cooper-

ative Research (ICR), discovered
that the Institute was engaged in
classiﬁed projects dealing with
chemical and biological warfare,

including the spreading of such
diseases as rice blast, inﬂuenza,
and anthrax.

This discovery, coupled wi-th
the fact that the US has made
at least limited use of chemical
warfare in Vietnam, led Meisel
and his associates to ask that
the ICR to discontinue its re-
search.

Meisel‘s protest, and the fol-
lowing controversy, have not yet

succeeded in forcing the ICR out
of business. However, Meisel tried

to emphasize the moral issues in- -

volved in this type of warfare.
He characterized chemical and

biological warfare as “war against
the people,” while the war in
Vietnam is supposed to be a war
for the allegiance of the people.
The destruction of their crops can
only lead to their hatred and dis-
trust.

Meisel went on to add that this
was not just an academic point.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Cy-
rus R. Vance, referring to arsenic
and cyanide sprays, has said,
“We have made limited use of
them in the Southern part of
Vietnam, but not yet in the
North.” .

SFP, the group that sponsored
Meisel’s speech, will have a meet-
ing tomorrow at 7 p.m. in 706 SU.

On Literature Dissemination

  Poll To Reveal Opinion of Men

by GEORGE EDELMAN
“I do not wish any senator to
be goaded or duped into saying
something against the will of the
constituency,” shouted Frank Cri-I
safi, vice-president of the Men’s
Dormitory Council (MDC).
On this national, MDC over-
whelmingly approved Senator
Steve Hecht’s proposal of a for-‘+.
' mal poll» to gauge the opinions
of Towers’ residents on the lit-
erature dissemination issue.
“My belief is that this is a
representative body,” declared
Senator Hecht as he introduced
a bill for the poll. The senators
‘concurred that Hecht’s formal
poll should ‘include meaningful
alternatives to current MDC dis-
tribution rules. Hecht urged that
“opinion of men residents should
be an important factor in this
decision” on the suspension of
the present dissemination policy.
This poll proposal evoked con-
siderable response. Prior to the
discussion, President Thomas
Meiser said “whatever the dorm
council does on this subject, it
will be supported by other or-
ganizations.” Wayne Master-man
stated the “poll should be parti-
cular” and asked that MDC de-
lay the poll until after Oct. 27.
‘Paul Nielson, secretary of MDC,
expressed approval of waiting
until the end of the four-week
trial period. Nielson, stating that
the “wording of the poll is very
important,” wants the Executive
Board of MDC to see the poll
before its ﬁnal form is acted
upon.
Offering sharply contrasting
views James Pranskyan declared,
“I do not agree with Senator Hecht
that the men are well informed.”
Pranskyan believes that many
men don’t know the details of the
actual rule.” They don’t know
the rule doesn’t apply to elec-
tions,” continued Pranskyan. “It
-15 Suspended one week before.”
Addressing his fellow senators,

he queried, “Will the poll be ar-
bitrarily decided on or do we get
to see the questions?”
Preceeding the poll discussion,
the MDC senators elected Robert
Dowd as president pro-tem. In
the absence of nominees for the
recently-vacated office of treas-
urer, President Moisner can ap-

IFC Ball
To Be Held
This Friday

Final plans have been announc-
ed for the upcoming Interfrater-

dy Nudelman, chairman of the
IFC Social Committee. This year’s'
Ball will be held Friday, at the
Churchill Valley Country Club
from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. As in the
past, dress will be semi-formal.

This year, however, the Ball
will include something new: A
show will be put on by Pitts-
burgh’s Marcels during the course
of the evening. The Greeks and
their dates will dance to the rock
and roll sounds of the Napoleon-
ic Wars and the Latin sounds of
the Tijuana Trumpets. A repre-
sentative from each of the fra-
ternities can pick up his houses’

ness of the current regime in Red
China. During the summer both
professors wrote articles defend-
ing their views for the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette.

According to Dr. Chu, the
course will concentrate on un-
derstanding the development of
Chinese culture, society, and po-L
litics in the face of a rapidly
changing world. The historical
background will allow the stu-
dent to make his own analysis of
contemporary developments on
the mainland and on Formosa.

by FRANK ALTIVIAN

For the ﬁrst time the Catholic

Church officially recognized the
right of any individual to refuse

to serve in the armed forces of‘

his country on moral grounds, ex-
plained Father Donald‘McIlvane,
at a discussion entitled “Draft
Law and Conscience,” sponsored
by the Pittsburgh Committee for

' a Sane Nuclear Policy.

One of two speakers at the
meeting last Thursday, Father
Mcllvane spoke on. the “Horror
and Perversity of War” and ex-
amined the Catholic viewpoint
on the role of the conscientious
objector (CO) as seen by the Sec-
ond Vatican Council. Directly op-
posing the present draft law, Fa-
ther Mcllvane believes that an
individual can be morally op-
posed to a particular war like
the one in Vietnam and, hence,
be qualiﬁed for draft exemption.
The present law states that to
qualify for classiﬁcation asféi CO
a man must be conscientously
0DD0Sed to all War, no exemp-
tion being given for particular

wars.

The other speaker at- the meet-

ing was Marjorie Matson, attor-
ney for the American Civil Lib-
erties Union. She spoke on the
legal aspects of CO, including the

Lieutenant Tumpson left his re-

1951 draft law and the recent
court interpretations of that law.

The attorney outlined «proce-
dures for persuading draft boards
to grant CO classiﬁcation and re-
minded the C0 that he has a debt
to society that is repaid«by being
“assigned to civilian service’ in
work of national importance” in
lieu of military service. '

The most conspicuous member
of the audience was a Lieutenant
Tumpson who currently studies
law at Duquesne University.

THE LIFE AND THOUGHTIOF FRANZ RO-SENZWEIG ‘
Writing in the August issue of Commentary, Milton Himmelfarb asserted that Franz Rosenzweig, a
little known German-Jewish layman had had a greater impact upon the thought of contemporary
Jewish thinkers in America than in any other thinker, including Martin Buber. Rosenzweig’s most creative
period was during the nineteen-twenties. He was a religious existentialist and a student of Hegel. In
some ways, his career calls to mind the carer of a German Christian who has enormously influenced
American Christianity, Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Dr. Rubenstein’s course will be in effect an introduction to

(Editor's Notes’ Mr. Sack’s is
Chairrnan of the Liberal Arts

 THE, CONCEPT of educa-
tion is not static. Yet des-
pite its primary importance
to the ‘University student,
the student is often ignorant
‘:"of t'he structure and mobil-
-ity of his educational envi-
‘ -. ronment.

The blame
for this igno-
rance must be
be shared
equally by the
student, the
administra-
tion, and the
Liberal Arts
"Cabinet, the
I . SACKS liason organ-
ization between the student
body "and the faculty and ad-
‘ministration of the School of
7 Liberal Arts.

’A The basic reason for the
;'continuity in ignorance is
;due ’mainly to a’ breakdown
in communication and. en-
hanced by a negation of re-,
sponsibility on the part of
‘the student body.

A FURTHERANCE in this
--lackadasical attitude toward
the foundtions of the Liber-
al Arts’ programs can only
. be tragic. For the present at-.
—mosphere surrounding the
;School of Liberal Arts is
;f charged with change.

_ _-.. ELEVEN STUDENT lead-.
fers are evading their respon-
"iﬂsibilities. They are dealing
 with personalities and _poli-
4 tics, insteadvof the issue of

buti-on policy.

Many of the ideas circu-
lating through the Dean’s
office have been promulgated
by interested faculty or ad.-
ministrators. Interchange
with other universities has
fostered a large. quantity of
the current thought. But the
student body is the single
factor which stands to be af-
fected the most by any inno-
vations or alterations that
are installed.

And for this reason the‘
students should act not only
as a sounding board or an
experimental group, but also
as a thought provoking for-
um, initiating ideas as well
as testing, them.

IN PAST years, the Liber-'

al Arts C-abinet has failed to
assume it proper place in
the perspective of the educa-
tional community. For this
reason,‘t'he Cabinet is a non-
entity, an unknown quantity.
Exactly what its functions
are and what power it has
can’t be judged now because
of lack of precedent.

As the representative of
the School of Liberal ‘Arts,
the Cabinet is endeavoring
to express its feelings and is
also endeavoring to elicit a
response from the student
community and the faculty.

Currently high on its agen-
da. is the subject of free
electives, which would en-
able the student to take a

MDC & Mot

and (2) That rules be estab-
lished to deter any abuse of
distribution policy.

Eleven “student lea.ders”

‘opposed the requests. They

said: (1) Those faculty and
students signing this request
were “duped”; (2) The is-
sue “is a POLITICAL IS-
SUE, not a question of free-
dom,”. and (3) -That “it is
solely the right of Men’s
Dormity Council (MDC) to
decide the question.

SUCH AN appraisal rests
solely on motivational as-
sumptions. This is not a re-

limited number of courses
for credit without receiving
a grade except for a “p” for
passing work or an “f” for
failure. Courses open as free
electives would be those up-
perclass courses in which a
student has a genuine inter-
est, but no real aptitude.

ALSO CURRENT in dis-
cussions is the subject of
program majors, enabling
the the competent student
to design his own course of
study in his junior and ‘sen-
ior years for his major work.

Another task of the Cabi-
net is a competent and re-
vealing evaluation of the
major lecture courses.‘ Such
a.n evaluation would beneﬁt
not only the student body,
but also faculty members
and departments.

The Cabinet also antici-
pates a poll concerning hon-
or policy in the University.
A subcommittee is current-
ly ‘polling the faculty on the
feasibility of having all past
tests on ﬁle in the library.

The Cabinet functions pri-
marily for the beneﬁt of the
student body. For this rea-
son, it hopes to inform the
students of educational al-
terations and in turn be in-
formed by the students of
desirous proposals. As a
channel of communication,
the Cabinet feelsit is most
pertinent to function.

sponsible means of criticism.
The question is not whether
two students of the 51 stu-

dents and faculty have po-.-

litical motives. The question
is whether the dorm rules
should be changed. The “stu-
dent leaders” denied the con-
tent of the requests by imput-
ing motives to the signees.

The “student leaders” also
failed to realize the signees
were urging, not dictating, a
rule change. Distribution of
literature effects both the
distributor and recipient.
The signees merely asked
that their opinion be weigh-
ed as members of the Uni-
versity. They never said it
was not MDC’s decision.

MDC has failed to cope
effectively with this issue.
The four-week trial period is
a farce. They should have a
parliamentary ‘discussion of
the issue at their next meet-
ing. MDC representatives

and representatives of the I

Ad-Hoc Committee should
present_~their case. A time-

Look at the Issues

\

LAST WEE.K’S televised-
debate between the Pennsyl-
vania gubernatoral candi-
dates clearly brought out the
distinctions between the can-
didates and their platforms.

During his seven-minute
introductory statement, Ray-
mond Shafer, Republican
candidate, did nothing but
laud Pennsylvania’s great
economic progress. His im-
plications were that the
Scranton - Shafer Adminis-
tration was the cause of the
“great growth.” This logic-
al fallacy is an insult to the
intelligence of any educated
person.

To say that one of two
events which occur together

in time is the cause of the
other is logical absurd. The
facts are that the entire
country has gone through a
spectacular period of eco-
nomic growth,_ beginning
with the Kennedy adminis-
tration. Thus, Shafer’s main
issue is totally inept.

a While Shafer is the epi-
tomy of vapidness, Shapp, on
the contrary, has taken a
constructive stand on most
important issues.

SHAPP HAS come out as

a supporter of free higher
education. He has been a
successful businessman and
has devised
Pennsylvania would make an
investment in .its main re-
sources — the youth who
will one day lead the coun-
try. He cited the fact that
successful plans are now
working in California, New
York, and other states.

‘While statistics may be

made to lie, Shapp’s do not..

Pennsylvania annually sends

36 per cent of high school I

graduates to college com-
pared to a national average
of 54 per cent. This may be

related to the fact that

Pennsylvania has the second
highest college tuition rates
in the nation.

Shafer appears to be
against free higher educa-
tion. His only remarks on
the issue are derogatory.
Just as he attacked every
constructive bill to help
Pennsylvania while” serving
as a state senator, he now
attacks Shapp’s plan for
higher education. His igno-‘
rance on the matter came
out quite strongly when he
said, “neither California nor
New York have free educa-
tion.” Perhaps Shafer should
consult the handbook of the
University of California

The

Goo,/‘America’

a plan where

 
 

 

K},

by Robert Zavos ‘

(over 100,000 students on
eight campuses) which says.
“tuition is free to California
residents.”

BUT SHAFElR has shown

how statistics may be made
to lie. When he cites the

. great change in unemploy-

ment statistics he compares
the month of January of one
year with September of an-
other. Shafer is undoubted-‘
ly unaware that employment
ﬂuctuates. during the year
and certain months are high-
er than others. Comparing a
high month of one year with
a low month in another is a
case where statistics are dis-
torted. *

Another signiﬁcant issue
is the abolition of the milk
control commission. Shapp
has come out to say that
this is his main hope on this
issue. He would let the free
market determine retail
prices. On the other side,
Shafer has said he would re-
tain both retail and whole-

« sale price regulations.

Shapp has come out with
a constructive stand on clean
streams, transportation, tax--
ation of utilities, and the‘
proposed railroad merger.
His opponet has done noth-
ing aside from criticizing
these programs.

SHAFER’S ENTIRE cam-
paign is based on platitutes
about Pennsylvania’s great
prosperity and criticism’s of
Shapp. Even the conservar
tive periodical, The National ‘
Review, has "labeled Shafer
as a “lofty generalizer” and
“me too" campaigner.

When The Pittsburgh Press
came out as a supporter of
Shafer, it could offer no rea-
sons other than the fact that
Pennsylvania has grown dur-
ing the Scranton-Shafer ad-'
ministration. It could not
say it supported any speciﬁc
issues, because Shafer has
none. Educated readers must
doubt The Press’ credibility
as a responsibile metropolit-
an daily newspaper.

It would be a disaster if
Shafer is given the highest
post in this state merely be-
cause he served as lieutenant
governor when this state did
make some economic gains.
One can only !hope that
Shapp’s constructive pro-
grams of free higher educa-
tion, abolition of milk con-
trol on the consumer level,
improved highways, clean
streams, taxation of util-
ities, and opposition to the
railway merger receive the

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH

Way back in 1953 I started writing this column about

. campus life. Today, a full 13 years later, I am still writing
this column, for my interest in undergraduates is as keen

and lively as ever. This is called “arrested development?

But where else can a writer ﬁnd a subject as fascinating
as the American campus? Where else are minds so nettled,
bodies so roiled, psyches so unglued?

Right now, for example, though the new school year has
just begun, "you’ve already encountered the following dis-
asters:

1. You hate your teachers.

2. You hate your courses.

3. You hate your room’-mates.

4. You have no time to study.

5. You have no place to study.

Friends, let us, without despair, examine your problems
one by one.

1. You.hate your teachers. For shame, friends! Try
looking at things their way. Take your English teacher,
for instance. Here’s a man who is one of the world's
authorities on Robert Browning, yet he wears $30 tweeds
and a pre-war necktie while his brother Sam, a high school
dropout, earns 70 thou a-year in aluminum siding. Is it so
hard to understand why he writes “F” on top of your
themes and “Eeeyich !” in the margin? Instead of hating
him, should you not admire his dedication to scholarship,
his disdain for the blandishments of commerce? Of course
you should. You may ﬂunk, but Pippa passes.

2. You hate your‘ courses. You say, for example, that
you don’t see the use of studying Macbeth when you are
majoring in veterinary medicine. You’re wrong, friends.
Believe me, some day when you are running a busy kennel,
you’ll be mighty glad you learned “Out, damned Spot!”

3. You hate your room-mates. This is, unquestionably,
a big problem—in fact, the second biggest problem on
American campuses. (The ﬁrst biggest, of course, is on
which side of your mortar board do you dangle the tassel
at Commencement?) But there is an answer to the room-
mate problem: keep changing room-mates. The optimum
interval, I have found, is every four hours.

4. You have no time to study. Friends, I'm glad to re-
port there is a simple way to ﬁnd extra time in your busy
schedule.'Al1 you have to do is buy some Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades. Then you won’t be wasting pre-
cious hours hacking away with inferior blades, mangling
your face again and again in a tedious, feckless effort to
winnow your whiskers. Personna shaves you quickly and
slickly, easily and breezily, hacklessly, scrapelessly, tug-
lessly, nicklessly, scratchlessly; matchlessly. Furthermore,
Personna Blades last and" last. Moreover, they are avail-
able both in double-edge and Injector style. And, as if this
weren’t enough, Personna is now offering you a chance to
grab a ﬁstful of $100 bills. The Personna Super Stai less
Steel Sweepstakes is oif and running! You can win $1 ,O00
and even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for'de-
tails and an entry blank. Don't just stand there!

5. You have no place to study. This is a thorny one, I'll
admit, What with the library so jammed and the dorms so
noisy. But with a little ingenuity, you can still ﬁnd a quiet,

-deserted spot—like the ticket office of the lacrosse team.

‘ Or a testimonial dinner for the dean. Or‘ the nearest re-

cruiting station.

 

You see, friends? When you’ve got a problem, don’t lie
down and quit. Attack! Remember: America did not be-
come the world's greatest producer of milk solids and
sorghum by running away from a ﬁght!

* * * © 1966, Max Shulman
_The makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades

§Another Day

Panthers Flat, Middies

Excited, Fans Bored

By Tom Sacks
A Sports Editor

VIIIIIIIIIHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

For the second week in a row the Panther defense was
digging in at the goal line when thetgun sounded ending the
game. Last week it was West Virginia with the ball, driving
for wha.t would have been the winning touchdown. This
week it was Navy’s turn. But nobody really cared this time
for the game had ended a long time ago.

It just goes to show that you can never ﬁgure out col-
lege games. Across the state line in Columbus, Ohio, Michi-
gan State. which belongs in the AFL and not the Big Ten,
barely edged Ohio State, 11-8.

_ This was the weekend the Panthers were supposed to
be building up a head of steam. Against Duke and Califor-
nia, they had, lost but had not been out-
. played. The West Virginia game revealed
1 that they Weren’t born losers.

They were supposed to have momentum
Saturday. They were at home. Jim Flan.i-
gan, Dewey Chester and Greg Keller all re-
turned tothe lineup with their injuries in
the past. Navy had lost three straight
games.

There were also some personal motives
involved. For coaches Dave Hart, Jim Roy-
er and Bill Neal this was a personal home-

   

coming. Navy had been their home prior to coming to Pitt

and they would have liked a good showing. —

Instead they got the most boring game of the season.

“Naturally, I wanted more from my kids in this one
than any other one,” said Hart. “I didn’t get it. This one
was our worst. Just terrible.” ~

' As far "as generating excitement is concerned, Navy
wasn’t much better than the Panthers.

Navy’s coach, Bill Elias, begged to differ, however. “I
didn’t think we were dead.”

Budd Thalman, the Middie sports publicist claimed that
Saturday was a pretty exciting game. When you live in
Annapolis, even a ﬂat football game must seem like the epi-
tome of excitement.

Several weeks ago Hart claimed that the Panthers were
playing over their heads and he didn’t know how much long-
er they could keep it up. He found out Saturday. Or maybe
he didn’t. Because this time he said, “I think our kids are
better than this.” ,

According‘ to Flanigan, there’s not much that can be
said. “I didn’t think the defense was that bad. But before
we were hardly in t e game, it was 17-zip.”

Most of the blame has to rest with the offense. Five of
Eddie James’ passes were intercepted, but it wasn’t really

. his fault either. The ball kept bouncing out of Panthe.r hands ‘
into the Middies’. The Navy secondary seemed to know ex-

actly what each pass pattern entailed. As Mickey Rosbor-
ough ‘said, “They were set for us.” '

In the meantime, Hart claims that something is going
to be done with the offensive team. Hopefully, he won’t
make them sit through the. game ﬁlms, or they might fall

by GEORGE LIES

It was Navy’s “surprise”
play which doomed the Pan-
thers, 24-7. They used it
throughout the game, and even
Hart, who for two years coach-
ed at the Academy, didn’t know
about it.

Hart ﬁgured his friend and riv-
al, Navy Coach Bill Elias, would
try something different for the
game. And Elias said after the
game, 4“We made some changes
in our defensive alignment this
week, mainly because Dave knew
our system.

“We knew they were going to
throw the ball,’’ said Elias, and
Hart supported the. Navy coach’s
strategy saying his game plan
was to throw on ﬁrst down.

Hart anticipated somerthing dif-
‘ferent, but even when he did see
the “surprise play,” he could do
nothing to stop it. Navy built a
lead with it, and Hart could only
console his quarterback Ed James.

For it was James’ passes which
were “tipped” and caught by
Navy defenders that stunted the
Panthers. And for two hours Sat-
urday, it was Navy’s best offen-

sive weapon.

In the beginning, after -each

team punted once, James drop-
ped back to pass for the second
time. The aerial was intended
for split end Bob Longo, but it
was tipped and caught by Mid-
shipman Bob Havasy. In nine
plays, Navy’s John Church made
it 3-0 with a 27-yard -ﬁeld goal.
, Before a minute passed, Navy
pulled the play again. A “ pass
popped out -of the arms of Mickey
Roborough and fell into the
arms of Fred Bayer. Midship-
man Bayer ran 40-yards down
the right- sideline for a touch-
down. Church made it 10-0.

Before the half, Navy scored
again. It was the offense this
time, and they did it in two plays.
Quarterback John Cartwright
passed to end Rob Taylor who‘
caught the ball on the Panther
30-yard line and outraced ﬁve
pursuers to the goal line. Navy
led 17-0 at halftime.

After the halftime entertain-

In the fourth period, and with
the game out of the reach of the

Cubs Overcome Own Mistakes;
Shade Mountaineer Frosh, A 20 — 19

by ROY JACOBS

The freshman football Cubs must have
the winning material. All day Friday they
outran, outpassed, and outcaught the West
Virginia irosh; at the half it looked like a replay
of the Varsity’s games with Duke and California
with WVU leading, 13-0'. The Cubs--broke the mold
with 20 points in the third quarter for a 20-19 win
in their season opener.

Before the game it was no secret that the Cubs
were rusty from lack of practice, and the Little
Mountaineers parlayed offensive mistakes into
all three of their touchdowns. Backﬁeld timing
was way oﬂf and broken plays and patterns were
evident in every offensive series.

On the other hand, the Cub defense played an
extremely detedmined game, setting up two scores

‘ for the offense and holding WVU‘ to minus seven

yards rushing in the second half. The pass rush
was particularly effective, throwing Mountaineer
quarterbacks for a total of 29 yards lost.

“The Pass rush got better as we went along,”

said coach. Steve Petro afterward. “The ends did‘-

a good job. (Bob) Ellis and (Paul) Naponick were
excellent. -
“And we. can’t discount the backs. Collectively
they were outstanding. They had three intercep-
tions and shouldfve had at least two more.” Jeff
Barr had two, one in the end zone and one on the

’ Cub l9 to end the game.

. If there was a turning point for the Cubs Wit

   
 

came in the -third quarter after WVU took a 19-6
lead. After missing an attempted two-point con-
version, quarterback Garland Hudson was ejected
from the game for ﬁghting with Cub Frank Oliver.
The Little Mountaineers lost their top offensive
weaponand also had the kickoff moved from the
40 to 25 because of the personal foul.

After Joe McCain returned the kick to the ,_

Cub 42, coach Petro made two backﬁeld changes.‘
Denny Ferris was inserted at tailback and Chuck
Winters‘ took over at quarterback. Apparently it
was a good move because four plays later Winter
lobbed a screen pass to Ferris which covered 55
yards for a touchdown.

A minute and a half later, after Paul Bergman
recovered a WVU fumble, Winters ﬁred 21 yards
to wingback McCain for another score. McCain's
kick proved to be the deciding point. Winters, who
also had a hand in the Cubs’ ﬁrst score, was the
object of Petro’s praises after the game.

“Winters did an outstanding job,” said Petro.
“He made the offense go when the others had
difficulty.” The coach also was very pleased with
the play of Ferris, McCain, ex-quarterback George
Medich who punted and played split end, and tight
end Rod Fedorchak.

Winters was hurt in the fourth quarter, but
Petro expects hefll be ready for the Notre Dame
freshmen this weekend. The coach felt that for
this week's game the Cubs will have to improve

considerably. .

   
  

quarter. With the score 17-7 at this point, Rosborough’s catch could
have kept the Panthers close. On the next play. however, James’ at-

l

3-2 by Slippery Rock
As Ref, Whistle Prevail

V by MIKE BROURMAN
As they boarded the bus for the return trip home, the
soccer team members were shaking their heads in disbelief.
Disbelief over the 3-2 loss to the Rockets. Disbelief over
Slippery Rock’s All-America Jack Jarvie.

Jarvie was the difference in the game. He was not a lineman.
He was not a halfback or fullback. He was not the Rockets’ goalie.
He was the referee. ‘

A former Slippery Rock player refereed the game in which his
former team was participating. Jarvie’s sentiment was apparent
throughout the game; _

Item: With Pitt leading 2-0 on goals by Sal Tavares and Bob

_ Racunas, Slippery Rock made a long kick toward _the hooters’ goal.
Goalie Len Harmon ran out and caught the ball. Once a. goalie catches
the ball, the opposing linemen are not allowed to touch him. But,
Slippery Rock’s John Ferrone elbowed Harmon, and Harmon elbowed

,

him back.

Jarvie called a foul on Harmon, and gave Ferrone a penalty
kick. At this call, the booters were flabbergasted. Assistant coach
George Somer said, “I've never seen ‘a call like that in my life.”
Ferrone made the goal and Slippery Rock was in the game.

Item: Sal Tavares got free in front of the Slippery Rock goal,
and prepared to shoot. He was hooked from behind, a sure penalty
kick call, as the Rocket player later admitted. It was not called.

Item: Again it was Tavares. This time he ifaked out the goalie
who -had wandered far from the net. As Sal went around him to

 A Weekend
ToRemember

For Alabama

It was a great weekend for
Tom “Alabama” Sacks. Sure he
almost drove his bike into a
safety island. Sure he got shot
down three times for Saturday
night ‘

But so what. “Alabama” pick-
ed 13 (count ’em 13) winners,
lost only Pitt and Miami’s upset
of Georgia, and wound up lead-
ing the Yogi pack for the week.

“I’m hot after the girls,” he
warns. That’s what “Alabama”
does best. Nevertheless, he moved
into a tie for fourth place, just
two games in back of the leaders-

Fred “Blood ‘n’ Guts” Frank is
the other occupant Oif the 12-3
record. Noting the improvement,
“Blood ‘11’ Guts” asked, “Does

this mean I’m going to win?”,

When he didn’t get the answer
he wanted, “Bang” sulked away.

_,,  Steady George “Moustachio”

 Lies remained_in third place, one
game off the pace set by -the
girls and players. The Mousta-
che did something he rarely does.
He went with an upset try and
it cost him. No George, Texas
did not beat Arkansas.

Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein went
against the Bear and that cost,
him. Tennessee came close but
Alabama prevented a “Flatbush
surge.

shoot, the goalie knocked him
ﬂat with an elbow and a knee. In
all, this occurred three different
times. Jarvie’s only response was
to warn Tavares about his “dirty
play.”

With everything going against
them, and only a one goal lead,
the hooters made a fatal mistake.
They started laying back on de-
fense. When they stopped apply-
ing the pressure, they lost con-
trol of the game. Slippery Rock
scored twice and that was it.

On Wednesday the soccer team
travels to Grove City. Sommer
recalls the game there two years
ago. “They beat us 5-3. Three of
their goals were on penalty kicks,
on the fourth they had a man at
least ten feet offside. On the
other one, our goalie had caught
the ball when one of their guys
ran into him and kicked him un-

‘conscious. The ball rolled loose,

and they kicked it in. And the
ref counted it. Until today it was
the worst refereed game I’vé
ever seen.” Jack Jarvie remem-
bers that game too. He refereed it.

Ham.-gr. Upset
Handleman Sets Record

by ANDY SWARTZ
Just what is good enough for cross-country coach Jim
Banner? Saturday, Fra.-nk Handelman broke the Sehenley

Park course record by more
of 22:01.8 as the cross-country
team swept the ﬁrs-t ﬁve places,
defeating Grove City College,
15-40.

Despite the lopsided victory
for- the harriers, coach Banner
was still disappointed with the
team as a whole. At the conclu-
sion of the meet he said, “It was
a lousy meet. The boys are not
doing enough work and are Njust
going to have to work much
harder than they have been.”

The explanation for this com-
ment by— Banner can only a be
justiﬁed by the fact that the
team’s individual times were
quite varied. Following Handel-
man, Fran Shor came in at 22:50,
Larry Hubner and Paul Greig at
23:09, and Ken Lawton took ﬁfth
at 24:04. Banner has been work-
ing on closing the time gap be-
tween Handehnan and the rest
of the team, particularly Ken
Lawton, who ﬁnished more than
two minutes behind Handelman.

It was a so-called perfect day
for cross-country with a strong
Wind behind the runners almost

 Playhouse Review

 
  
  
  
   

  by cmmnms names A
 Bartold B‘recht’s A Man’s
I a Man stormed the Pitts-
burgh Playhouse this past
.week, with fantastic power.
This “Brechtian morality
play,’’ directed by John Han-
I cock, is the first of what prom-

playhouse.
- As in Marat-Sade, one of the

techniques used in this produc-
tion is to involve’ the audience.
as completely as possible.

Upon entering the theatre, we
ﬁnd that we have come to see a
draft recruitment show "of the
-1920's. The stage and theatre are
"decorated with ﬂags and signs
 such as “Join the Army and See
the World” or “Every Nice Girl
Loves a Soldier.”

The lights dim and three bizar-
re, whitefaced ﬂappers start play-

ises to be a great season at the-

-M. 3 -,—-THE pm!-‘News  Monday,’ October 1?i,'19ss

ing Brecht’s song “A Man’s a
Man." This is the orchestra. At
the same time, 12 soldiers, who
are also in whiteface, come on
stage to sing the ﬂapper’s strange
piece.

As the plot develops, we ﬁnd
that three soldiers are looking
for someone to replace a com-
rade who they have lost. Galy
Gay, a gullible farmer who only
wanted to buy a ﬁsh, is selected.
Just then, however, the curtain
comes down and the mistress of
ceremonies for the recruitment
show comes on stage. She in-
forms us that we are about to
witness the -transformation of
Galy Gay. A dupe will become a
man.

Merit must‘ go to the entire
cast for their ﬁne acting, and
especially to Charles Durning,

whose portrayal of Gay Gay was ‘

breathtaking. Mr. Hancock, the
