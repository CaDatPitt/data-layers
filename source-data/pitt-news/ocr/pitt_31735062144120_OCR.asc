Omicron Delta Kappa initiated

.two 1944 graduates, James

Hardie and Larry McBride, into
their society at their fall meet-
ing, Friday, September 15. These
men were honored on Tap Day
last spring, but their actual initia-
tion did not take place until Fri-
day. Because of their transfer to
the AS'TP, the postponement was
necessary.

The meeting was presided over
by the new president, John I.
Whiteman. Among those present
were the new vice—president, Sid-
ney Klein, ‘Dean Theodore W.
Bidle, Dean Stanton C. Crawford,
Dr. G. W. Crouch, Carl Lewin,
and James Baker. Both of the
new executive ofﬁcers were elect-

 ed to their positions last May.

139 Students Enrolled
In ASTR Program

Pitt was named one of the ﬁrst schools in the nation to train
young men in the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program last
spring. The ﬁrst group of trainees arrived at Pitt on June 8, and are

now in their second semester of classes.

In the ﬁrst term their tac-

tical ofﬁcer was Captain Simon, but at the present Major Haylak is

in charge.

In order to enlist in this program the men must be 17 years old,

but not over 17 years and nine months.
in the armed forces, these men are essentially civilians.

Although they have enlisted
They are

fed, clothed, housed,
their tuition paid by the War De-
ment. They are not on active duty
at the present time, but are sub-
ject to call on or after their 18th
birthday. They may withdraw
from the program at any time,
but this will disqualify them from
ever entering any A.rS.T. program.

During the first term none of
the trainees reached 18, but two-
thirds of them will be 18 before
this second semester ends on De-
cember 2. The men will not be
called to active duty until _they
finish their second term, although
they are 18. When they are call-
ed to active duty they will be
in the Army Air Corps and go
through the regular training.

Of the 201 men who entered
Pitt in June, only 162 completed
the ﬁrst term. There were 20 stu-
dents who withdrew from the pro-
gram, 3' who were separated from
disciplinary reasons, and 16 for
academic reasons. So far this
semester 10 more have dropped
out of the program and 15 have
been removed for academic rea-
sons. The number of students now
enrolled in the A.S.T.R.P. at Pitt
is 139.

War Fund Drive

and welfare agencies of the Com-
munity Fund and the rest will go
for Allegheny county’s share of
the 22 war relief agencies of the
United War Fund.

Dr. Safford Speaks
At “Y” Luncheon

Dr. Hurd Safford, of the Uni-
versity’s chemistry department,
will speak at the Monday Lunch-
eon Club’s ﬁrst meeting on Octo-
ber 2. His address on “Recent De-
velopments in the Field of Chem-
istry” will follow the 12:30 lunch-
eon at the Metropolitan branch of
the YWCA on Dithridge street.

The purpose of the club, as one
student expressed it, is “to let
the campus get acquainted; to
meet old friends and_ to make new
ones.” And it is with this end in
mind that Jean Kimpel, C, the
social chairman, has planned 2
series of luncheons at which stu-
dents may beeome acquainted
with their favorite professors ir
a social and informal manner.

These luncheon meetings wiI'
take place on the ﬁrst Monday of
every month. All students at Pit
are eligible to attend; the only
pre-requisite ‘being that of sign-
ing up on the Luncheon Clui
sheet which is posted on th(
ground ﬂoor bulletin board unti?
the preceding Friday afternoon
The fee of twenty-five cents may
be paid at the luncheon.

Because a great number of stu-
dents are expected to attend the
meetings, Mrs. Batz, director of
the University YW, has suggest-
ed that those hoping to come
sign uprin advance. Mrs. Batz
also mentioned that ideas from
the students about both type 0‘

War Activities Committee Plans
Novel Letter for Serviceman

Credit goes’ to the war activi-

dent body.

Registrar Releases
Enrollment Data

Although ﬁgures are still incom-
plete, registration for the fall se-
mester at the University of Pitts-
burgh will likely exceed’ any fall
enrollment since Pearl Harbor.

Dr. J. -G. Quick, registrar, calls
it “a deﬁnite upward trend.” He
says “There is every indication
that greater emphasis is being
placed upon adequate preparation
on the ‘part of those who will be
engaged in postwar activity.”

Figures have been -obtained,
only until the close of registration
Friday night, he said. ‘Since then,
others, have been enrolled. Never-
theless these ﬁgures -are well
ahead of those last year and the
year before.

“So far we have registered 726
freshmen against 580 last year, a
gain of 25 percent despite incom-
plete ﬁgures this year.-Of these
freshmen, 5-66 are in the arts and
sciences against 386 last year, a
‘gain of 46 percent. Then the

has 33 percent more freshmen than’
last year.
“There is also a remarkable in-

crease in students

classes. ‘This year we have 1469
against 1067 last year or an in-
crease of 37 percent.

Chapel Service Friday

The ﬁrst Chapel service for this
year will take place in Heinz

If, to Man, the cricket seems to hear with its legs, it is possible
that to the cricket Man seems to walk ‘on his ears.

—Anon, 19th Century.

There has been a lot of talk, since the war began, about
preparation for the post-war period. Newspaper columnists
prophesy the importance of the Big Four at the peace table;

strategists and statesmen outline vast programs of world re-

habilitation; domestic manufacturers advertise the Wonders of

C the “new machine age”, the nation’s colleges and universities
 are preparing the younger generation to administer and operate
5 intelligently. We will not be caught unprepared.

And yet, in this magniﬁcent scheme of things, very little is
mentioned, either in the papers or in the classrooms, of tolerance.
Oh, yes, it’s written in the Bill of Rights that we may worship as
We choose, that all receive identical protection from the law,
» », and that we can speak our minds if we darn well please. And

C Joe Smith next door as.serts, with that golden—rule-look on his
face, that “just so long as they let me alone, I don’t bother no
one.” But that’s not the whole story. It’s tolerance in the
little, personal ways that counts. And that kind of tolerance

 is whatwill mean so much towards making a peace that sticks.

C B Not only do we need to guarantee the rights of a people by law

 ..and~de’cree, but we must secure them with understanding and
1 ,‘ respect.

Right here at Pitt for instance, in the Tuck Shops and the
Commons Room, there are examples of intolerance on which to
practicqe. On this campus, as on every campus, there is‘ a great

T tendency for students, sheeplike, to set up irrevocable standards
pf what to think, how to dress, what clique to follow, how to
spend leisure time, and even a style of jargon. That ’s ﬁne. That ’s
normal and to be expected. But the norm is carried too far
when we ridicule and deride the actions and thoughts of the
“vindividualists” merely because they constitute a minority ‘or
deviate from the average. Nasty jibes and cutting remarks in
such public places as the Tuck Shop and Stadium are strictly
a out of order-—even in fun. Pitt, as an educational center, is
far too much the “great leveler” to permit -such indiscretions.
 At any time, but especially this year when the Four Free-
ijfdoms are so hard-fought for, here ’s a suggestion for all students.
While preparing scholastically to participate in the post-war
reconstruction, get ready to meet this new world and its prob-

." lems with tolerance.

. If, in as small a place as the University, constituted of such
~ conglomerate peoples, there cannot be more tolerance, how can
 there be hope for the whole world?

, Remember, there are two very good sides to every question.
'*yAnd' we could be walking on our ears.

Ifa stranger asked the average Pitt student what popped
into his mind ﬁrst, upon hearing the words University of Pitts-
I _,. burgh, he would probably answer the Cathedral of Learning,
and then the Commons Room. This room, cathedral—like in
, atmosphere and structure, was designed as the heart of the build-
ing and is symbolic of the heart of university life. “The Com-
-imons Room embodies within its very walls the essence of edu-
cation,” the Vade Mecum reads. Visitors to the University re-
mark the beauty of the room and repeat the inscription in hand-
wrought iron over the gate with feeling. “Here is eternal
spring. For you the very stars of heaven are new.” This Com-
"mons, created as a place for students to meet between classes
and to carry out social affairs, is digniﬁed and calm, suited to
C personal conversation and quiet meditation in its dim recesses.
It is quite a jolt, then, to see students breaking the almost
spiritual dignity of the Commons Room. with rowdy behaviour
~ that would not take second place to a Pep Rally in vigor. The

pers, and newspapers that litter the furniture and ﬂoor. It is

 There are smoking rooms and the Tuck Shops in which to
' smoke. All eating should be conﬁned to the ground ﬂoor. And
if you must wrestle and scream, there are physical education
 courses and the stadium to serve as an outlet for excess energy.

ortment, the student body should observe these few requests.

Talk Can Be Raised To An Art
B y Intelligent F orethought 1

With the world full of ‘armchair strategists, post-war world plan-
ners and dogmatists on every subject, the art of ﬂuid conversation
with its interchange of ideas is rapidly becoming submerged in a sea
of positive -declarations that brook no discussion.

John Doe has spent a few hours with a map of Burma and the
opinions of a few military analysts, and he’s bound and determined
that the company will hear; his views on just what it is that Lord

Montbatten is doing wrong. Nor

does it occur to him that perhaps

his hostess might be more inter-
ested in discussing the latest play
or his host the Yankees’ pennant
chances.

In an effort. to return conversa-
tion to the high standingewhich it
once enjoyed among cultured peo-
ple, D. C. Russell discusses the art

of conversation in the May issue
of Good Housekeeping magazine.

“Conversation is a communal
matter,” he writes. “It concerns
other people, and like all com-
munal matters should be subject
to restrictions. We are not al-
lowed to make nuisances of our
selves in our communities, for the
law would stop us quickly,
whether it be for the possession of
an angry-minded dog, the playing
of a loud—mouthed radio, or the
tendency to take something that
another possesses.”

From a wealth of experiences in
the company of good talkers, the
writer offers the following valu-
able suggestions of the art of con-
versation:

“Even if the conversation is
about something in which you are
not interested,‘ listen and perhaps
you will become interested; we
all enjoy gossip on occasion,‘ but
to -conversation as an art it adds
little except malice and indicates
chieﬂy a sterility of ideas; trying
to win by raising the level of your
voice will not raise the level of the
conversation; the point of an ar-
gument is not to show how right
and infallible you are but to draw
forth opposing views.”

Evening Bus Ad School-

Offers New Course

Five New Men 1   

Lead Cheering

“Yea, Pitt, sock it to ’em!”
The slim boys you saw, and will
see, on the edge of the Stadium

turf this football season are ﬁve of
Pitt’s youngest and most promis-
ing cheerleaders. Leader Larry
Burwinkel, Sandy Lampl, Dan
Mallinger, Dick :Seewa1d, and Jim
Ludwig will incite that good 01’
student enthusiasm at all the com-
ing fall games.

Displaying unexpected initiative
at the game last Saturday between
Pitt and iWest Virginia, they
trooped over to the school chil-
dren’s section at the half and led
the youngsters in cheers for the
team. They
couldn’t have been a West Vir-
ginia rooter “among the kids” be-
cause of the -cooperation they re-
ceived.

Also pleased with the Pittites,
the ﬁve of them happily predict
even better results after a few
rousing pet v rallys. Jim Ludwig
said that the “freshman boys
cheered well.”

“They practiced the cheers at
the freshman banquet at the Col-

lege ‘Club Friday evening,” he A

added, “and I guess that helped
a lot. ‘They certainly were right
in there with the rest of the
crowd.”

Of the ﬁve, Larry Burwinkel
and Dan Mallinger were cheer
leaders in high school, Central
and Schenley C respectively. The
remaining thre are swinging meg-
aphones for the Iﬁrst time.

“Our squad.’s kind of green this
year,” one of the boys admitted
frankly, “but we’ve been practic-
ing a lot and we hope to get better
for every game. We think we have
a pretty good team, and gosh, who
doesn’t think they deserve a lot of
cheers!”

Recreational Math
Given at University

Tired bankers, harried tax ac— A

countants, an-d just «plain hobby-
ists are offered a new course in
“recreational mathematics” this
fall at the University of Pitts-
burgh.

The evening school bulletin lists
the course as one “-designed pri-
marily for business and profes-
sional men and women interested
in .mathematics as a mental exer-
cise and recreation.”

It will survey “various types of
puzzle problems and their methods
of solution.” Included will be
“magic squares, selected topics in
the theory of numbers, diophan-

tie analysis, and mathematical

tri-cks and paradoxes.”

Its vprerequisite, according to Dr.
James S. Taylor, ’ head of the
mathematics, is “the ability to
think.” “While only a knowledge
of elementary algebra and geom-
etry will be assumed-, college
standards will be maintained
throughout,” he said.

Regular students may take it as
an elective but many not count it
as part of a major or minor in
mathematics is satisfaction of dis-
tributed ﬁeld requirements. Teach-
ing the -course will be Dr. M. M.
Culver, Dr. A. E. ‘Stain-ilanrd, and
Dr. John O. Blumberg.

Unique Dance

At Dithridge Y

Stamp and dance——that’s the
way it’s done. Simpler than walk-
ing across the ﬂoor, and much
entertaining. Anything goes from
the Russian two—step to the Amer-
ican square-dance in this folk-
dancing fest. ‘Folk—dancing—the
newest pastime to come out of the
war.

Folk-dancing is no original war-
time creation. It’s rhythm itself.
It’s fundamental. Nothing can
outmode it. That's why it has
lasted while other dances have
passed away, for folk-dancing in-
cludes essential elements that other
dances lack. It’s easy, the steps
are simple, the rhythm is clear and
catchy, it’s sociable, it depends on
the group instead of the individual,
and it’s fun!

Monty Mayo knew this when he
started the Pittsburgh folk-dance
group at the Catham street YW
where they dance the Troika and
the Hovah, and take everything in
their stride from the Varsovienne
to the Black Forest Mazurka. So
there’s going to be a folk-dance at
the Dithridge Y on October 14 for
college students. It’s free and it’s
easy, and as Monty says, “Any-

The American Telephone and Telegraph Com-
pany, its twenty-one associated operating tele-
phone companies, Bell Telephone Laboratories,
and Western Electric Company, continue to face
unprecedented demands for telephone communi-

cation.

Never before in the country’s history has there
been so much evidence of the indispensable part
telephone service plays in the life of the nation.
It makes a direct contribution to the effectiveness
of every part of the war effort.

The sense of responsibility which telephone
people call the “spirit ofservice” is in this war
the “spirit 0 f victory.” The men and women of the
Bell System, in whom this spirit lives, may be relied

upon to do their utmost.

Overseas Package

Rules Announced

This year the Christmas mail-
ing period‘ for both army and
navy -overseas forces is the same
as the previous year—September
15 to October 15. After October
15 no gift parcel may be mailed to
a soldier without the presentation
of a written request from him.
The parcel must not exceed ﬁve
pounds and must not be more
than 15 inches in length or 36
inches in length and girth com-
bined. It should be marked
“Christmas parcel” so that it may
be given special attention to assure
its arrival before December 25».

Not more than one parcel may
be mailed in any one week to the
same member of the armed forces
by or in behalf of the same mailer.

Relatives and friends who know
that the personnel in the armed
services to whom they plan to
send gifts are at far distant points,
s-hould mail their packages as
soon as possible. Last year late
mailings, causing concentration of
great numbers of packages in the
rﬁnal days of the mailing period,
threatened. to defeat the program.

It is stressed that success can be
assured only if the public gives
full cooperation through prompt
mailings of the overseas gift par-
cels from the opening of the mail-
ing period. Assure your service-
man of a “Merry Christmas” by
mailing his gifts early.

The football squad. is in ur-
gent need of boys to serve as
apprentice managers- They
will be required to attend

Hi everybody —- hope you’re
feelin’ tip top. Welcome to the
Pitt Pourri gossip shop! I’d like
to start off with a fair warning
to that big beautiful class of
Freshman women —— when you
hear that loud call, “Ho” — don’t
be confused -— it’s the new wolf
call of PiKA. This is a direct
warning to that bomb shell Betty
Mae Poﬁenberger from Vander-
grift, Pa.

Congratulations to Phi Mu Gene
Larson —- she’s now wearing a
Phi Gam pin. Larry McBride (an-
other Pitt man in khaki) is the
lucky fellow. Yep, Figi pins are
really ﬂying around.

By the way, did anyone notice
the happy and confused gleam in
Lois Westbury’s eyes? Think I
know the reason. Her little sailor,
Bill Parsons, came ‘home —— just
at registration time. No wonder it
took Lois six hours to register.
Her only remark was, “Fraternity
sisters or not — those ‘Tri Delts
certainly took good care of my
honey while I struggled thru the
mill.”

His pin wasn’t enough for Betty
Ann Crede — she had to have a
ring. Yes, Betty and Gus Wilde
really -did it up right Sept. 15
with a ;preacher, a chunk of glass,
honeymoon and everything that
goes with it. Mom and: Pop Wilde
are going to shack up at Rhode
Island.

By the Way, Mr. Robert Buhl,
just what are all those keys ﬂash-
ing and dangling fr-om your key
chain. Loaded down aren’t you?
Do I see the symptoms of a fu-
ture BMOC?

Dick Brunk, the little chemee,
whd practices hypnotism, certain-
ly put the jinx on Jean Kimpel
when he was home on furlough.
Yep, those new Lieutenant bars
did things to Jean’s heart. Inci-
dently that diamond on the third
ﬁnger left hand looks Iplenty sharp
too.

From the looks of things Bill
(Fuzzy) Heintzleman has turned
out to be a gay man about town.
One of his many night adventures
was the Phi Delt summer formal
at the South Hills country club.
His little woman was ‘Terry Gorm-
ley. Hmmmm. Romance is in the
air.

Len Matonak, a famous 2.9918
engineer is suffering from blond
trouble — 'he’s been going around
with that dazed “Oh, how I miss
you” look on his face ever since
Jane Seymour went back to Hood
College. There’s a slight gleam
in his eyes though —— it’s rumor-
ed Jane will be ‘here for the big
weekend of the Notre Dame game.

Well, it’s off to press now for
this column of gossip —— so, until
next week. “That’s all folks.”

University Evening School
Expands Fall Curriculum

The University 0-f Pittsburgh
evening school will offer the most
extensive program it has ever
given with the opening of classes,
September 25. Inclu-ded will be
courses impossible to give during
the past two years because faculty
members were needed to instruct
soldiers.

Some courses, begun as war

measures, will be retained. Among
them are. geography and climate.
A new evening course in animal
geography will deal with the
faunas of many lands, their origins
and migrations. The geography
of the far east, the Pacific and
Mediterranean will also be given.

The history of air power, new
this summer, will be continued.
Other timely courses will be the
histories of Russia, of Great
Britain, and of the ABC nations-
Argentina, Brazil, and Chili.

Three modern languages will be
given by the quick conversational
method the Army found effective.
There -are Spanish, Portuguese,
and Russian. Other languages
will be taught the traditional way.

’The physics department offers
the fullest work it has ever given
in the evening. Noteworthy will
be electronics, ex—ray testing, and
spectroscopy. The mathematics
will be a novel course. In psy-
chology, work not given during
the past two years will be re-

O‘ sumed with the fa-culty-now freed

from army duties.
In Engineering, the opportunity
this year is unique. Because men

of college age are in the Army,
the teachers who would be in-
structing them in day classes are
free for evening duties. More
courses are to be given than in the

past, some perhaps, not to be re-
peated at night.

One of the ablest and most alert
staffs in the country will conduct
classes in Business Administra-
tion. Here is a full range of work
in accounting and auditing. A
new course in commerce is of-
fered. Also one in transportation.
The course fo-r real estate men will
be repeated. Business law, eco-
nomic-s, industrial management
and relations, and personnel man-
agement will be given as well as
complete programs for the Amer-
ican .Institute of Banking and for
the Chartered Life Underwriters
of America.

The School of Education will
continue its usefulness to the
30,000 teachers in commuting dis-
tance of Pittsburgh. New em-
phasis will be placed on religious
education with three new staff
members c-onducting courses. The
School of Nursing also has a broad
program. The Bureau of Retail
Training offers six evening
courses.

The fall bulletin is not avail-
able. Dr. Frank W. Shockley, Di-
rector of Evening Classes, and his
staff consult with prospective stu-
dents Mondays through Thurs-
day evenings until registration on
September 12. Consultations will
be held. in 2701 Cathedral of
Learning.

General To Speak

On Russia, Peace

Dr. Mari-on Hathway, professor
of public welfare at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, is chairman of
the Pittsburgh Council of Ameri-
can-Soviet Friendship which is
sponsoring a meeting at Carnegie
lecture hall on Monday Evening,
October 2, at 8 o’clock. General
Victor A. Yakhontoff, an o-utstand-
ing authority on Europe and Asia,
and the author of several books
and numerous magazine articles,
will lecture on “Soviet Russia and
World Peace.”

éthis was so. He particularly liked
the "Fifth-Bigelow corner at sun-
set and so came every evening for
three weeks in August to get the
proper lighting eﬁect. The basic
sketch of the Cathedral had been
made in the morning, however,
and the shadow play on the walls
so intrigued him that he came
back t-o paint it too.

Then in September o.f the same
year, Grapin walked through
Schenley park and found the Ca-
t-hedral wreathed in fog at high
noon. “So I dashed home, got my
paints, and caught the scenec that
I had waited weeks to ﬁnd. It was
the same way with the Cathedral
in the snow; I had no hopes of
painting when I left home, but to-
ward evening it started to snow,
and as I stood by the statue of
the Spanish-American war soldier,
the ﬂakes melted and blotched my
oaints. ‘The effect was unortho-
dox, but so interesting that I left
it on the paper. Thus came about
the mottling.”

When asked why he painted in
water colors, since he is, after all,
an architect, Grapin replied that
water color was a superb medium
for his purposes, and not at all
the monopoly of amateur dab-
blers. His opinion, in fact, of
those who relegate water colors
to the level of fancy female-paint-
ed velvets is quite unprintable, if
very interesting.

Grapin explained, however,
that “an architect must know
structure and composition,
water color is an excellent medi-
um for teaching composition, since
the painter must Work with na-
ture, and Nature alone can teach
composition properly. The water
colorist must further, select from
many angles the best one, and
when he has found his position,
‘work rapidly, since time and light-
ing are his limiting factors.

“Goodnight Sweet Prince”
By Gene Fowler

On the night of May 29, 1942,
death came to John Barrymore;
actor, drunkard, lover, philand-
erer, debtor—-man. But because
he was the personiﬁcation of most
men’s hopes and fears, h-e is not
forgotten.

' Judging by the usual standards
of comparison Barrymore died a
failure. That, however, is not,
can not, be true. Before he can
properly be evaluated, one must
try to ﬁt the “jig-saw puzzle” of
his character into a recognizable
picture.

Why could he not live for long
with any of his wives, each of
whom he loved dearly? “The
bottle may have been the chief
cause of each domestic furor; yet
in this respect we can not wholly
the implications of
John's own statement, “unhappi-
ness increased the drink, and
drink increased the unhapiness.”

Was he a conceited “ham”; or
did he attempt to gloss over his
inner sensitivity with a thin veneer
of sophistication? A friend of his
summed up this phase of his car-
acter when she said, “He was the
greatest of all actors; yet he was
avid for criticism. When I had to
criticize him, he took it wond-er-
fully well. But that is always
the way with greatness. Only a
second—ra-ter makes things com-
plicated and is difficult to handle.

Impractical? Deﬁnitely. Dur-
ing his life he earned three mil-
lion dollars, nevertheless he died
a pauper. How did this happen?
“There were many just debts and
debtors; but were we to enter
into an analysis of Barymore’s
harassment by fair weather leech-
es and foul-weather bleeders who
drank at the veins of an impair-
ed memory, it would be to write
an essay on parasites.

When his health began to fail he
could have entered a plea of bank-
ruptcy. But he disregarded his
failing memory, shattered dreams,
‘impaired health, and went to work
to wipe out his debts. In order
to wipe ‘them out, during the last
two years of his life he lam-
poned himself and all he stood for
unmercifully. That, from a prac-
tical standpoint, was stupi-d; b-ut,
from a moral one, noble.

Yes, John Barrymore was an
ordinary man. He made mistakes
—a great many of them. Yet he
differed fro-m most men in this
respect, he never grumbled when
he had to pay for them. He said,
“A man properly must pay the
ﬁddler. In my case i-t so happen-
ed that a whole symphony or-
chestra had to be subsidized.”

Veterans Given
New Two-Year
Art Course

To help war veterans take their
places in civilian life as quickly
and as efficiently as possible, the
University -of Pittsburgh is offer-
ing a new curriculum with the
opening of the fall semester, Sep-
tember 25, it was announced.

The new course will run two
calendar years and will lead to
the degree of associate in arts. It
is open to those honorably dis-
charged from the service who
have completed preparatory school
or who can pass an examination
in subjects required for high
school graduation.

The degree of associate in arts
has never been given at Pitt.
However, it is a recognized de-
gree given for the completion of
work in junior colleges after two
years’ study. _

The new two year course is op-
tional for the veterans. They may
enter any school or department in

the University for ‘which they.

have qualiﬁcations. They may
decide the number of terms they
wish to spend in study. Those who
take it will attend regular classes
and may enter campus life on the
same basis as regular students.

“The shortened course is only
offered as a help,” according to
Dr. Sta/nton C. Crawford, dean of
the College. “The men who will
come to us have given months and
even years in their country’s serv-
ice. To add four college years
would delay them more than we
feel is justified. So we have short-
ened the course, believing that the
two years saved will be of utmost
importance.”

The’ University of Pittsburgh
has been asked to serve as advise-
ment center for the Pittsburgh
area. It will consult with other
colleges in the district to ﬁnd the
most effective means of helping
the veterans.

Max Scherb

The players on the Panther squad were convinced after Satur-
. ‘day’s contest that had the breaks been a little more even they could
_ have easily taken the Mountaineers by a bigger margin than the 26-13
score. More than one gridder returning to the bench after the par-
ticipationin the fray stated that the “hillbillys” were easier to run
{against than our own scrubs. Yet with a succession of bad breaks the
‘score indicated a much closer game. A holding penalty on the 11; yard
line cost the Panthers one certain touchdown. A long pass on which
West Virginia scored her second six—pointer might have been broken
up had the secondary man covered the receiver more closely. How-
ever other factors proved that the Jungle Cats had potential offensive‘
power that would improve with practice as was shown by the 19 ﬁrst
downs they rang up as for ﬁve for the visitors. An exhibition of of-
fensive power was shown in the manner in which we repeatedly took
the ball deep in our territory and had the grit to drive downﬁeld.
Pitt’s passing attack showed that it had a real cutting edge which
needed only a little sharpening.
. I . *
i The well publicized fact of ﬁve freshman in the starting line-up
proved no hindrance in winning last Saturday’s skirmish. Although
there is still no substitute for experience, the frosh members of the
squad gave a creditable account. of themselves. Both quarterbacks,
Buddy Freese and Paul Rickards, looked like seasoned veterans.
Freese handled the ball as though he were born to the role and did
‘not fumble once during the entire ball game. He ran the team in a
/J manner that would do credit to a far more experienced ﬁeld general.
. Paul Rickards, his Wheeling teammate, might be given the edge in the
passing department. Paul’s passes were repeatedly hitting their mark,
but he was unfortunate in that his receivers were in early season form.
Kelly Zimovan, Al Zellman, and Jack Peyton made successful debuts.
Zimovan looks as though he might develop into one of the best offen-
sive ends that has come out of this district in a long time. Al Zell-
man’s a former all-city player in 1936, who has just returned to
school after being discharged from the Army. Mike Roussous lived
up to his advance notices and was one of the best defensive lineman
on the ﬁeld.

Fran Mattioli ﬂashed signs of the All-American form that was
prophesied for him this year. George Ranii and Joe Defrank gave
better than average defensive performances. Gene Gaugler provided
an outstanding running and defensive exhibition, while captain
“Cricket” Kalmanir played his usual brilliant game.

introduced and members of the
team will be called upon to say
a few words, proving that foot-
ball players can both play and be
public speakers contrary to popu-
lar impression.

The cheerleaders, Larry Bur-
winkle, Danny Mallinger, Jim
Ludwig, Richar'd Seewald, and
Sandy Lampl will lead the stu-
dent body in some of the old
cheers and will attempt to intro-
duce some new ones that will be
used in the game against the
“Fighting Irish.” Records will be
used and then “Hail to Pitt” -and
the medley will be sung. Al-
though this is not a full program
and more will be announced later
it should be the nucleus for a
rousing rally. The rally will be
over about 1:15 o’clock permitting
some time for both food and
rushing to the next class.

Two other rallies planned by
the Student Congress are before
the Illinois game and before the
Penn S-tate contest. Jim Ludwig,
chairman of the rally, says, “If
the students support the rally then
the team will support the school.
Show up for the rally and show
the team that we ar-e 100 percent
behind them.”

Sideline Chatter

Pitt was deep in her own ter-
ritory. It was fourth down and
10 to ‘go. One fan who had kept
up a consistent chatter through-
out the contest, much to the dis-
gust of others, bellowed out “Pitt’s
going to punt.” Another exasper-
ated fan could contain himself
no longer and shut the chatter-
box up for the remainder of the
contest with this remark: “Stop
analyzing the game. You’re gonna
ruin my fun.” 

* * 3!:

The Panthers had the ball near
the sidelines and attempted an
end run to the short-side of the
ﬁeld, the ball carrier being forced
ou-t of bounds. A cute blond turn-
ed to her escort and inquired
“Why didn’t he run around the
other end? There’s more room
that way.” Her puzzled companion
answered her question expertly.
“It’s too far to run,” was his reply.

Irish Unveil A
Ed McKeever '-

After digesting one victory the
hungry Panthers are looking for-
ward to the untested Notre Dame

team which comes next Satur-
day. That the “Fightin’ Irish” are
green in more than one aspect is
very apparent if we are to be-
lieve Ed McKeever, acting head
coach in the absence of Frank
Leahy, now in the Navy. “We’re
green, but willing to learn” is the
information that McKeever re-
veals about his‘ squad.

This pessimism is similar to
the brand that “Cryin’.” Frank
Leahy used to toss around, and;
it is likely that McKeever’s style
of football at Notre Dame will also
bear a resemblance to Leahy’s.
McKeever served as Leahy’s as-
sistant at Boston College and
came with him to Notre Dame
where they continued to turn out
fine elevens. McKeever, on his
own for the first time, is «a per-
fectionist.

He works along with his boys
and insists that ea-ch knows his
assignment perfectly. I “That
makes a better mental balance”
he explains. “When they go out to
play a game, they are equipped for
anything the other players throw
at the-m.” ‘

Before hooking up with Leahyj
Coach Ed aided ‘Pete Cawthon iii
coaching ‘Texas Tech from 1935
to 1939. With the ﬁne ‘a‘ppentice-'-
ships he has gone through, it re-
mains to be seen if McKeever’§
own technique -will be successful.
His team has lost most of its’ ‘stars
to the armed forces. The Pan-
thers, on the other hand, have
tasted victory. This, plus an eag-
er desire for revenge over last
year’s defeat, should make‘ Mc-
Keever’s 1944 debut one to watch.

Chatham Subs for Tech

The Chatham Field Army Air
Base has been scheduled for a
game on October 28. The original
game for that date with Carnegie
Tech had to be cancelled when the
Tartans decided to drop football
for the duration. Little is known
about the air f-orce team. At ﬁrst
it was announced that the game
was to be played at Savannah,
Georgia, but since the Panthers
already ‘had three away games it
was moved to the Stadium.

Notre Dame Team
Young But Good V

If superstitious fans are to be
recognized, then -the unlooked for
will happen when Notre Dame

meets the Panthers on the Sta-
dium ﬁeld Saturday. The contest
will be the 13th in the series be-
tween the two elevens. Just what
the unlooked for event will be is
hard to say. Since the Irish are
favored, a Panther victory would
certainly upset the applecart.
The -team from South Bend is
again loaded with grid stars but
these brightspots on the team
have yet to prove themselves '-on
the collegiate gridiron. No longer
with the squad are some of the
great players from last year’s
eleven, such names as Lujack,
Miller, Rykovich, White and Yon-
akor included among -the absent.
Back for another year, however,
is B-ob Kelly, a 19-year-old Navy
trainee. Kelly was good enough
last year to take Julius Ryko-
vich’s backﬁeld position away
from him. .
Included on the Irish squad are
several -district boys who are ﬁg-
ured to give the team plenty of
spectacular playing throughout the
10-game schedule. Two of the
gridders are from Vandergrift.
Another is from Windber. The
Vandergrift players are Joe Gas-
parella, 6-foot-3, 205-pound quar-
terback, and John Mastrangelo,
6-foot, 200-pound guard. Gaspar-
ella is touted to be a better pass-
er than Angelo Bertelli or John-
ny Lujack, both of ‘whom were
outstanding in slinging the pig-
skin. The Windber boy is Nunzio
Marino, another back. Marino
sparked Windber Hig-h to an un-
defeated season last year and then
was chosen on the All-State team.
The Irish coach, Ed McKeever,
is aware that publicity has put

a heavy pressure on Gasparella‘
and Mastrangelo and has made it I

known that his two young stars
will not be in the game for the
opening kickoff. The two local
lads will get into action after
their jitters disappear. Frank
Dancewicz will probably hold
down the quarter-backing post un-
til Gasparella takes over. Others
in the backﬁeld willbe Kelly and
Maggioli or Terlep at the halves,
and either Elmer Angsman, 1943
squad member, or Freshman Rudy
Krall'will be at fullback“

The Irish line has plenty of
beef, but ‘is also lacking in ex-
perience. Mastrangelo will replace
Fred Rovai at right guard when
his nervousness wears off. George
Sullivan will hold d-own the tackle
post left vacant by the departed
All-American Jim White. Johnny
Adams, a 6-foot-7-inch letterman
is the other tackle. The only other
sure starter in the forward wall
is Guard Pat Filley—provided
that he is in condition -to play.
Filley, the ﬁrst Irish captain to be
re-elected in 25 years, is recover-
ing from operations on both his
knees.
