Summer 2012 I The Pitt News I vvx/v\/\/.piitnevvs.com

Letter from the Editor: Welcome to Pitt and The PittNews

I know the 100 pages might appear daunt-
ing, but this stack of newsprint could be
one the most valuable things you’ll come
across this summer in your effort to become
acclimated to the city. '

When I found the New Student Guide

“in my bag during Pitt Start —- buried

among all of the other useful pamphlets
ofinforfﬁation such as dining options and
transportation — it was the only reading
material that I read cover to cover. It wasn’t
because Iwanted to join The Pitt News, but
because what better way to learn about your
campus than from people who have spent

years learning its ins and outs?

Inside of the New Student Guide, we
don’t just tell you the different options for
dining at and around Pitt, we tell you which
places your peers recommend. That’s.be-
cause after being at Pitt for several years,
people learn the best meal at the foodlcarts
or the key to getting a spot in the Oakland

‘Zoo.

Our tireless news reporters, creative
A&E staff, veteran columnists and team of
sports fanatics cranked out dozens of sto-
ries, and then our editors, pagedesigners
and business staffworked for hours to pro-

   tech updavtesl;m'n text 

duce the pages that you-hold in your hands.
But we don’t stop serving the students
after the New Student Guide. The Pitt News
is your primary source for campus news
during your time at Pitt. We worked late
nights and early ‘mornings as we reported
on the bomb threats, and we had phones
glued to our hands as we covered the com-
ings and goings of four different football
coaches that passed through Pitt in two
years. \ _
About 100 students make up our edito-
rial division to produce stories, photos and
multimedia, and about 20 students make

up the business, side of our staff, selling
advertising and allowing The Pitt News
to remain an independent, student"-run
publication. ‘

But this year, we want the students to
play a larger role in The Pitt News. We’re
making the plunge into social media, but
that doesn’f‘Ynean that we just want to post
stories.on Facebook and send some Tweets.
‘We want to engage you. .

If we send out a Tweet asking for photos
from the football game, share some with
us, and we’ll share it with our audience of
more than 8,500 followers. On Facebook,
we ask for students and faculty to submit
their own pictures so we can feature them
as our cover photo. And while you’re on the
page, join the conversation-Disagreewith
one of our columnists? They enjoy hearing
opposing opinions.

If you d”:o"n’t like something we’re doing,

let us know. And if you do like something
we’re doing, let us know that, too.
If you hated the editorial or loved the al-

‘burn review, give me a call at 412-648-7985. ’

,Or Write a letter to the editor by emailing
letters@pittnews.com. Better, yet, come
up to the office at 434 William Pitt Union.
There are always people here during the
day, and sometimes we even stick around
until 1 a. m. making sure we put out a paper
that best serves the Pitt community.

You could also join us.‘
: If always being in the know, interview-
ing musicians or chatting with the men’s
basketball players sounds enticing, then
you should apply to be a part of our staff.
We’re always taking applications for our
news, opinions, arts and entertainment
and sports sections. We even have space.
for copy editors, illustrators, cartoon-
ists, photographers and page designers.
Information on all of that can be found at
pittnews.com. . ‘

You don’t”need to come in with a portfo-

lio of clips_,,photois or graphics. We’ll teach‘

you how to get information about crimes
and how to write, an interesting ﬁlm review;
The most important thing is that you’re
eager to learn. Oh, and you’ll get paid for
your efforts. It’s a lot more work than stock-
ing items ata convenience store, but the
rewards liere are"'fa'r better.

(Not only will you help to producea
better paper, but you’ll develop skills and
improve your resume. While some of our
former staff members have gone on to TIME
magazine or The New York Times, otliers
have gone on to careers unr.elat_éd'to jour-
nalism -- as lawyers, ad ‘reps and creative
directors, just to nameza f'e_w.1, . ' _

So stop by our office this summer or
in the fall once "you’re, moved-»in“ and are
comfortable. We love talking to people..: V
an amazi‘ g time in“ college]. .

Although overshadowed by the Cathedral of Learning, Heinz Chapel serves as an equally recognizable
feature in Oakland. Huailei Wang, Senior Staff Photographer

Zoe Owrutsky
Stqff Writer

Fun fact: Oakland used to be
the home of Forbes Field, the
park where the Pittsburgh Pi-,
rates played ball between 1909
and 1970. Embedded in the
floor of Posvar Hall is a glass-
covered home plate to mark the
spot where Pirates players of
yore scored their runs. in truth,
the real position for home plate
was a few feet over, in what is
today a men's room.

New students, get used to it: Oak-

land is where you’ll spend most

of yourcollege careers.
The neighborhood includes

the University’s academic build— .

ings, residence halls and off-
campus housing for a large por-
tion of Pitt’s student population.
From vast botanical gardens to a
notorious $5 pizza rivalry, Oak-
land’s diversity and intrigue nev-
er leave college students without
something to do.

Oakland is separated, geo-
graphically into three different

, sections. North Oakland encom- .

passes the area north of campus

and borders the Hill District and
Shadyside. Central Oakland sur-
rounds Fifth and Forbes avenues,

which is home to the Cathedral -

of Learning and most academic
buildings. South Oakland, the
residential neighborhood that
stretches all the way to Route
376, is the childhood home of
Andy Warhol and NFL Hall of
Fame quarterback Dan Marino.
Oakland-contains a mixture
of chain and family—owned busi-
nesses. Chains include Chipotle,
Panera and Subway, while fami-
lies own Pamela’s Diner, Fuel &
Fuddle and Leena’s Food.

. Also tucked between the hos-
pitals and the academic build-
ings are the Carnegie Muse-
ums, Phipps Conservatory and
Schenley Park, which are popular
destinations for college students
because they can access them for
free with their student IDs.

Oakland is also home to the
famous $5 pizza war. Sorrento’s
Pizza Roma and Antoon’s Pizza,
both late-night favorites among
Pitt students, are competing
pizza shops in Oakland.

Established in 1974 and locat-
ed on Atwood Street, Sorrento’s
is Oakland’s longest-standing
pizza shop. Students have voted
Sorrento’s the “Best Pizza in Oak-

land” for the past five consecu-
tive years in The Pitt News’ “Best
Of” Edition, which runs each fall.

Sorrento’s sells $5 large pies
after 8 p.m. every night and all
day Saturday. Antoon’s offers
large pies for $4.90 every day.

Manager Eric Majeski said
thatstudents love Sorrento’s
traditional recipes and fun en-
vironment. . - A

“There’s a real tradition here,”
Majeski said. “It tastes the same
as it did in 1974.” -

Majeski said that college stu-
dents are a large part of what"
makes the restaurant upbeat and
thriving.

“This place is pure Oakland,”
Majeski said. _

Less than a block past Sor-'
rento’s sits neighborhood rival

Antoon’s Pizza, which has also’

accumulated a respectable num-
ber of “Best Pizza in Oakland”
plaques from The Pitt News over
the years.

Justin Abraham has worked
at.Antoon’s — which his grand-

. parents opened in 1997 ~ for the

past ten years.

.“It’s got a great family at-
mosphere,” said Abraham, who
spends many nights working in

Oakland [>28

Shadyside a change

Em Maier
Staff Wrz'ter

Fun fact: Once a year, Shadyside
hosts the annual Shadyside Art
Festival on Walnut Street. More
than 150 artists from around the
nation crowd the street in an open-
air market free to _the public. This
year, the Art Festival will take place
on Aug. 25 and 26. ,

Bus: 71B, 75 or 71D outbound
on Fifth Avenue

Tucked within towering trees, Vic-

torian mansions and rowhouses lies -

the idyllic Shadyside neighborhood,
a popular weekend retreat for Pitt
students; ‘ ' '

,To the east of Oakland, only a-

15-rninute walk down Fifth Avenue,
the area is home to a vibrant con-
coction of young adults —— affluent
families, fresh professionals, art-
ists, musicians, undergraduates and
boutique owners. The area was once
home to the socialites of Pittsburgh
and still contains vestiges of Mil-
lionaire Row, where landmarks of
the Carnegies, Fricks and Mellons
once resided. -

Walnut Street, reminiscent of

Washington D.C.’s Georgetown or.

San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury, is
bustling with boutiques, shops and
restaurants ranging from upscale to
casual. Shoppingis abundant, includ-‘
ing national chains varying from J.
Crew and Banana Republic to Wil-
liams Sonoma and Apple.

“I love window—shopping on
Walnut, and generally, the quiet,

‘residential atmosphere. It’s a nice

escape to wander around the tree-
lined streets and be surrounded by
families, rather than students,” ju-
nior Alex Cathcart said. '

The neighborhood bars and eat-
eries are popular with students, fac-
ulty and staff from Carnegie Mellon,
nearby Chatham and Pitt. The area
is known for'its hidden treasures,

‘ including the charming Coffee Tree

Roasters and Cafe Zinho, a foodie’s
dream housed in a renovated garage.

The line out the door on a hot
summer day might be proof enough
that something special is inside Mer-
curio’s. Locals frequently stop by for
a cold treat at this award-winning
artisanal gelateria and pizzeria, Ju-
nior Wasiq Sheikh said he heads out
to the restaurant when a celebration

pacefrom rowdy
    Oakland

is in orderthat calls foralight dinner
followed by the lavish dessert.

“Not only can I go and get a fan-
tastic Italian meal, but I’m always sur-
prised to see the new daily ﬂavors.
This place is really original —— you’re
not going to ﬁnd typical ﬂavors any
time,” Sheikh said.

Mercurio’s mom—and—pop story
is not unlike many of the storefronts
gracing Walnut and its neighboring
streets. The family, who once lived 40

minutes away in Kittanning, moved ’

to Copeland Street six years ago be-
cause of the lack of frozen desserts
in Shadyside. Last year, the family
graduated onto Walnut Street, and
only afew months ago became more
of a full—scale restaurant.

“We came to Shadyside because
there was no ice cream or gelateria at
the time, and there’s a lot of walking
around here, and I like Shadyside for
numerous reasons. There are a lot

' of elements. It has a nice neighbor-

hoodly feel. There’s a nice balance
between mom—and—pop shops and
the larger chains,” said Anna Mercu-
rio, the owner of the gelateria.

She and her brother co-own the
store, having taken over from their
parents. Anna’s mother still makes
the gelato at the home creamery.

Mercurio aims to be an Italian
eatery — with wine, pizza and br-

uschetta — and then send patrons L

home with gelato. Mercurio said that
a lot of the recent success is due to the
loyalty of gelato fans, who now arrive
earlier in the evening for dinner or
after a shopping venture.

Ellsworth Avenue features more
entertainmentvenues, with upscale
independent boutiques and aﬁmkier
personality. The street bursts with
local hangouts such as Harris Grill
and the Bagel Factory. Not only does
it contain spas,jewelry designers and
antique stores, Ellsworth also pos-
sesses two of Pittsburgh’s favorite
vintage clothingvenues, Eons and

H Hey Bettyl.

— Notfarawayistheoftenforgotten
Highland Avenue, bordering on East
Liberty. There, one can experience
the whimsical delight of Oh Yeah!
Ice Cream and Coffee Co., an inde-
pendent coffeehouse and ice cream
parlor. .

cream, which comes from the parlor
located onAtwood Street, the own_-

South Side,

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

Fun fact: South Side earned Pitts-

burgh it‘s moniker “Workshop of _

the World" when the neighborhood
was a large producer of glass in
the 18005. Then, iron and steel
moved in for the latter part of
the century.

Bus: 54C, 54D, 75 outbound
on Fifth Avenue

Pittsburgh’s South Side has two
faces: During the day, it provides
a charming shopping experience,
and during the evening, people
crowd the streets for a fun night
out.

Once the center of the Pitts-
burgh steel industry, South Side
has transformed into a bustling
neighborhood with a seemingly
endless number of shops, restau-
rants and bars. The area is primar-
ily comprised of local shops with
large chains woven throughout the
neighborhood, and its location just
over the river from Oakland across
the Hot Metal and Birmingham
bridges makes it easily accessible
by bus, bike or foot.

Meg Procter, a junior majoring

East Carson Street /mbsfor eclectic retailers and night life

in natural sciences, goes to South
Side at least three times a semester
to shop and enjoy the area. She said
she and her friends go to South

Side because of the many advan— ‘

tages it has over Oakland.

“Oakland to walk around and
shop is not the ideal place,” Procter
said about the lack of shopping op-
portunities. “If we go shopping, we
usually go to South Side.”

One store that Procter particu-
larly likes is Goodwill, a thrift store
located on East Carson Street that
sells used items for low prices. She
said Goodwill is “one of the main
reasons to go” to South Side.

But Procter doesn’t limit herself
to purchasing resold items. She of-
ten frequents SouthSide Works, an
area located off East Carson Street
around 27th Street that is home
to big—name retail stores such as
Urban Outﬁtters, Claire’s, Kay]ew—
elers and Forever 21. A

And Southside Works isn’t just
an area for clothing and jewelry.
It’s also a good place for an up-
scale dinner and a movie date. The
Southside Works Cinema, along
with the Cheesecake Factory, bd’s
Mongolian Grill and other ﬁne
restaurants are all located in the

 

 

 7.1 ,_,, ,

area. And sometimes there are
concerts and other free events lo-
cated around the music stage in the
center of SouthSide Works.

Continuing down Carson
Street, students will ﬁnd a mul-
titude of shops ﬁlled with almost
anything —— from a life—size Yoda
ﬁgurine to hundreds of cigars.

For the musically inclined,
South Side has a number of shops
for both listeners and musicians
alike.

Dave’s Music Mine, located at
1210 East Carson St., has walls
lined with CDs, cassettes and vi-
nyl records. The store’s been a part
of South Side since its May 2000
relocation from Oakland.

Dave Whaley, an employee of
Dave’s Music Mine — but not the
Dave who owns it — said the store

i has a lot to offer over chain music

dealers. For one, Dave will make
special orders if a patron is looking
for something in particular.

“We are able to get a lot of stuff
you wouldn’t ﬁnd somewhere else,”
Whaley said. “We have a lot of stuff

that other places won’t have just g

Squirrel Hill a welcoming residential neighborhood

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

Fun fact: Before European settlers arrived,
Squirrel Hill was originally a Native American
hunting ground. The neighborhood’s Beech-
wood Boulevard takes the same curved path
Native Americans would take when they
went on their hunts for dinner.

Bus: 61A, 61B, 61C, 61D outbound on

_Forbes Avenue

  

Don’t let the name fool you, there’s more to
the Squirrel Hill neighborhoodlthan its signa-
ture oversized furry rodents and mini—moun-
tains. ‘ .

Only a 15-minute ride from Oakland on
any 61 bus, Squirrel Hill is home to an array
of independently-owned businesses and res-
taurants. '

The neighborhood’s business district takes
up two streets —— Forbes Avenue and Murray
Avenue — and the selection of intemation-
al cuisine options is reminiscent of Disney
World’s Epcot. Wandering up and down these

Greek, Chinese, French,_]apanese, Indian and

“There’s a ton of food up here that’s really
good,” said Zara Ostrander, 27, a sales associate
at Squirrel Hill mainstay Color Me Mine. “It’s
also a really good place for people to visit if
they’re looking for something to do.”

For those with less daring pallets, Squirrel
Hill is also home to more traditional eateries.
The neighborhood boasts no fewer than six
pizza shops.

either. Students can purchase cold treats from
Cold Stone Creamery, Baskin Robbins, Rita’s
Italian Ice, and Ben and Jerry’s — all located
on the same block of Forbes Avenue.

Of course, there’s more to this neighbor-
hood than eats. Students looking for entertain-
ment can ﬁnd plenty of options in Squirrel Hill.

The neighborhood boasts Forward Lanes
bowling alleys on Forward Avenue, a street
off Murray Avenue. Students can also bring
out their inner Picasso at Color Me Mine, a
ceramics painting shop on Forbes Avenue.

“Chances are really good [that freshmen]
forgot to bring a mug to school,” Ostrander,
said. “They should come visit Color Me Mine
and paint one. Moms love painted stuff. Dads,
too.”

Squirrel Hill is also home to the historic
Manor Theater. Renovated this past summer
to include a bar and both digital and 3-D pro-

jection, the 9o—year-old theater plays mostly
independent ﬁlms, with the occasional block-
, buster mixed in.

“There’s a ton ‘
of food up here

that’s really good.”

Zara” Ostrander

“We’re one of the only art house theaters
left in Pittsburgh,” general manager Geoff
Sanderson said. “We offer more of a quality
selection than some of the big chain theaters.
We try to retain all the art house movies but
spice it up a little bit.”

In renovating the theater, Sanderson said
owners Rick Stern and his daughter Alexa
‘Stern added touches of the past to the the-
ater, including restorations to the property’s
original marble ﬂooring and embossed ro-
tunda. They also added old movie posters and a
chandelier that replicates the Manor’s original

‘ adorned lighting ﬁxture to add to the nostalgic
motif. The Manor is keeping one 35-millimeter
ﬁlm projector on hand for use with smaller
movies only released in that format.-

.“They’re trying to combine the new and
the old,” Sanderson said.

V T Like the Shadyside neighborhood, several
upper-lend boutiques and clothing stores also
own storefronts in Squirrel Hill. For students
on a tighter budget, Avalon Exchange, on
Forbes Avenue, offers used and vintage cloth-
ing options at lower costs.

It’s also not uncommon for Pitt upper-
classmen to take up off—campus residence in
Squirrel Hill. A

“I have friends who live in Squirrel Hill,”
senior Kurt Stadterman said. “It’s peaceﬁsl.
There’s a neighborhood watch so you can’t be
rowdy. It’s a nice place to live.” I

ers have designed an innovative and
entertainingway to combine ﬂavors:
mix-ins. Frozen concoctions are ele-
vated to the next level, as ice cream is
blended with more than 100 mix-ins
from typical cookies to adventurous
ﬂavors such as avocado, fresh ginger
and smoked salmon.

For those overwhelmed by the
dazzling prospects, owner Ethan
Clay provides patrons with several
tried-and-true combinations, such as
“From Boston With Love” featuring
vanilla ice cream, oats, cinnamon
and coconut, or “The Big Lebowski,”
containing cookie dough, chai spice
and coffee grinds.

For a gourmand or one adventur-
ous to try new tastes and textures,
Shadyside boasts dozens of fantastic
fare. Soba, Urni and Casbah are three
notable and impressive eateries in
the neighborhood, featuring Pan-
Asian,Japanese and Mediterranean
fare, respectively. Walnut Street of-

fers several bars and coffeehouses 

perfect for an afternoon catch-up,
such asjitters, Shady Grove and Thai
Place.

In the summer, the area is trans-
formed from asophisticated Soho to

an open-air gallery, featuring more
than 100 artists from around the
country during the annual Shadyside
Art Festival on Walnut Street. A Fair
inthe Parkwill open on Sept. 7, just in
time for new students to get their ﬁrst
taste of Pittsburgh’s exotic art scene.

The Shadyside area is surrounded

by numerous parks and leafy av-

enues, such as Mellon Park, which

in addition to the monthly Jam on

Walnut fair, frequently features sum-
mer concerts and local pick-up sports
games.

Not only populated with bakeries
and ﬁne dining, Walnut Street also
has a few hidden local gems, such
as Kards Unlimited. A third—gener—
ation family-owned store, locals will
wander in to pick up abirthday card
and will leave amused and overjoyed
hours later. Featuring eclectic, quirky

, inventory, the store carries novels,
ornaments, apparel, political hu-

mor and, of course, cards. Students

could buy stamps claiming “WI'F”.

with varying levels of exclamations,
sticky notes expressing urgency via
profanity and checklists titled “Fash-
ion Citation” or “Things You Must Do
To Malge Me Happy.”

“Being into trying new restau-
rants, Shadyside has a boatload of
cuisines to try, as well as some nice
areas to relax and justtalk. It’s perfect
for everything,” Sheikh said. ﬂ

center in ?OO2, the area now known as
the Waterfront housed the Homestead Steel
Works. During World War II, the Homestead
Works produced more than 200 million
tons of steel for use in railroads, armor
and beams.

Bus: 61C or 61D outbound on Forbes Avenue

On the edge of the Waterfront stand 12 tow-
ering smokestacks — homage to the former
steel mills that built Pittsburgh.

Today, large and small stores, restaurants,
entertainment venues, apartments and of-
ﬁces taken the place of a neighborhood that
was the site of a violent strike that revealed
Andrew Camegie’s beliefs about labor rights.

In 1882, a famous labor and lockout strike
erupted on what is now a parking lot at the
Waterfront, one of Pittsburgh’s biggest and
most recently opened shopping centers. The
Homestead Strike, a major dispute between

« the Amalgamated Association of Iron and

Steel Workers and the Carnegie Steel Com-
pany, left about a dozen men dead and for-
ever stained Camegie’s image as a benevolent
employer.

But the once grim site of the steel mill
has since been replaced by a different sort
of bustle.

Big-name department stores such as Tar-
get and Macy’s and brand—narne retailers such
as Victoria’s Secret have set up shop at the
Waterfront. Just outside the busy commer-
cial area, residential Homestead sits largely
unchanged by the shopping-development.

There are plenty of places to grab a quick
bite while you’re shopping at the Waterfront.
Eat’n Park, Red Robin and Chick-ﬁl-A are all
readily available options for something quick
and inexpensive.

For something sweet, Custard Crossing

is a localstandout for ice cream. Drop by the

serving window for-quick $2 cones or take a
seat inside to escape the heat.

For students looking for something a little
more upscale, there are many different mod-

. .  mJ ' . ..
P.F. Chang’s China Bistro and Gran Agave.

Students looking to pair their dinner with
some entertainment have a few options as
well. Head over to the 22—theater AMC Loews
to catch the newest blockbuster movie in 2-D,
3-D, IMAX or IMAX 3-D. Students with some
time to kill during the day can get tickets
with their student IDs for $5 Monday through
Thursday before 6 p.m..

Another entertainment option is the Im-
prov comedy club, which has big names such
as Bob Saget and Wayne Brady perform on a
fairly regular basis. Younger students have to
catch their favorite comedian on a Thursday
or Sunday, because all other nights the club is
21-and-older. The ﬁrst and third Wednesdays
of every month are open mic nights, and those
are open to anyone over 18.

Manager Wintis Gibson added a note of
caution, however. “That’s subject to change,”
he said, referring to the club’s set schedule.
“Last Wednesday we had to cancel [open mic
night] for George Lopez.”

Dave 8: Buster’s restaurant, bar and arcade
is also located at the Waterfront offering video
games, prizes and food.

Senior computer science majorjoe Meszar
goes to Dave & Buster’s and then hits one of his
favorite bars in Homestead —— or sometimes
the other way around.

“The Blue Dust bar has like 25 beers on
tap, and they have a great menu,” Meszar
said. ‘Then I’ll go and spend like 60 bucks
at Dave & Buster’s on pool or basketball. Air
hockey is fun too.” A

A Kyle Stelmack, a junior and a Pathﬁnder,
likes the variety of shops and entertainment
options available at the Waterfront.

“Usually I go down there for a movie or
Dick’s [Sporting Goods], sometimes to go
Halloween shopping,” Stelmack said. “It’s
got a little bit of everything.” '

Strip District a weekend haven for sidewalk shoppers

Mahita Gajanan
Stqff Writer

Fun fact: The Strip District used to be a
who's who of Pittsburgh big business. Some
of the original businesses to inhabit the Strip

included U.S. Steel, Westinghouse, ALCOA,

and The H..J. Heinz Company. A

Bright dresses on outdoor racks ﬂuttered

The Strip District is often bustling on
Saturdays, with people looking to buy
trinkets or groceries, restaurants tend
to ﬁll up quickly as hungry families pack
together to eat breakfast. T

The Strip District encompasses a one-
half square mile area northeast of Down-
town Pittsburgh. The Strip is at its best
during the day and on weekends —— two
neighborhood breakfast staples, DeLu-

ca’s and P&G’s Pamela’s Diner, are always
closed by three in the afternoon. Many
shops are closed by ﬁve. ‘

In the Strip District, don’t look for any
big-box stores. From year—round black

Other vendors come to sell handcrafted

Tom Donaldson has come to the neigh-

Fun fact: Bloomfield is home to makeup
artist Tom Savini, the head of the
makeup effects for the 1978 horror flick
“Dawn.of the Dead,” which was filmed
in Pittsburgh. _
Bus: 54 and 93 outbound on Fifth Avenue
outbound from Oakland

Pittsburgh’s Garﬁeld, Lawrenceville and
Bloomﬁeld neighborhoodswere originally
built for the working class and mill workers,

and during Pittsburgh’s prolonged economic _

downturn, these areas fell on hard times.

But recent economic growth in these neigh-
borhoods has led to an inﬂux of ethnic restau-
rants, art galleries, cafes and bookshops that
appeal to college students who wish to take a
break from the modern campus buildings that
dominate Oakland. 4 .

“Part of its charm is that it’s this old, work-
ing—c1ass neighborhood,” saidjared Rossi, 34,
adding that his family traces its Lawrenceville
roots back for at least three generations.

Rossi attended Pittfrom 2003 to 2006 be-
fore graduating from the Community College
of Allegheny County, where he also worked in

' alaboratory for the department of endocrinol-

ogy. He currently works as a hairdresser in
Bloomﬁeld. He said that the newer, trendier
businesses appeal to the young professionals

 

he sees moving into the area.

About a mile and a half northwest of Oak-
land, Bloomﬁeld is within walking distance
of Pitt’s campus. Garﬁeld is just beyond it,
across Penn Avenue, and Lawrenceville bor-
ders Bloomﬁeld to the northeast.

While there is no direct bus route from Oak-
land to Garﬁeld, Bloomﬁeld and Lawrenceville
are both accessible via the 54 and 93.

One ofRossi’s favorite spots is the 300-acre
Allegheny Cemetery, which touches all three
neighborhoods and includes the grave of leg-
endary American composer Stephen Foster.
Rossi compared the cemetery’s rolling green
hills and surrounding wrought iron fence to
a peaceful national park.

“I go there a lot of times if I just need to go
somewhere and think,” he said.

In Bloomﬁeld — historically regarded as
Pittsburgh’s Little Italy —- Thai, Japanese and
Chinese restaurants have appeared among the
older, more traditional Italian eateries.

The area has also drawn artists recently.

Nicole Capozzi, 36, said she and her hus-
band opened Box Heart Gallery on Liberty

‘ Avenue'12 years ago.’ She said they chose the

area for their gallery, which deals in art and ﬁne
crafts by more than 400 artists from around
the world, because the shops and long-stand-.
ing restaurants provide a lot of foot trafﬁc
through the neighborhood. _ .
“It has that stability of these places that
have been here for the long haul, and that’s
why we chose here to open up an art gallery,”

   
   

rt. ‘

Awesome Books combines the aged look of Garfield’s past” with a colorful, modern

touch. Huailei Wang, Staff Photographer

Capozzi said, explaining that there are many

establishments that reﬂect the olderfeel of the _

neighborhood, such as some popular Italian
restaurants.

Laurajean McLaughlin, 46, opened Awe- A

some Books two years ago on Penn Avenue
in Garﬁeld, where weathered brick ediﬁces
still dominate over newer-looking renovated

- structures. McLaughlin said her store focuses

on books about poetry and art, although she

and her business partner, Bob Ziller, also in- I ' ~

clude new and used ﬁction as well as books on
anthropology, gardening, and other subjects.

She said that in the nine years since she
bought the building for her shop, the neighbor-
hood has become much more accommodating

l

to businesses and families. V

“It was really pretty bad here when I ﬁrst
came in. You would not see people walking
around at night,” McLaughlin said. Now, she
explained, the neighborhood has developed
into more of a community. ’

Rossi attributed much of the upswing in
the area’s economy to the 2009 opening of the
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC in
Lawrenceville. A _ - »

“It seems like [new establishments] are
doing a good job of revitalizing but keeping
it artsy in a good way,” Rossi said, explaining
that he hoped Lawrenceville and the adjacent
neighborhoods would not become “too com-
mercial.” E ’

Oakland can hop on any 61 or 71 bus for a quick
ride into town, where they’ 11 ﬁnd colossal towers
of steel and glass and buildings from an earlier
generationwith a composition ofbrick and con-
crete, such as the Allegheny County Courthouse.
At the heart of Downtown is Market Square,
an area located below the towering glass castle of
the PPG building. Menin suits and womeninpro-
fessional garb frequent the area before, during
and afcerbusiness hours. Market Square includes
‘dining locations such as Winghart’s Burger and
Whiskey Bar, My Big Fat Greek Gyro and Chipotle.
Pat Walling, a 25-year-old securities lender
for BNY Mellon, has worked in the city for two
years. He said one of the large draws to the city

‘ is the number of “big name” companies and

institutions, such as PNC Bank, Bank of America
and BNY Mellon.

‘There are a lot of opportunities,” Walling
said. “A lot of companies are still hiring.”

But it’s not just the opportunities that bring
people to Pittsburgh. The architecture and the
general, atmosphere of the town draw people
from across the countryto one ofAmerica’s most
livable cities. C

Sophia Riegel, a 19-year-old student at the
Art Institute of Pittsburgh, is originally from
Baltimore but came to school in Pittsburgh af-
ter visiting the city injanuary. On her visit, she
ﬁrst went to Market Square, where she saw the
holiday tree and skating rink. It was then that

she knew Pittsburgh was where she wanted to

' go to school. . _ .

“[I] visited Pittsburgh and loved it,” Riegel
said. “I thought [Market Square] was anice place
to hang ou ”

Ekrery November; holiday lights and ﬁreworks
light up Market Square and the surrounding
area. Ice sculptures, garland and musicians line
the street for Light Up Night, a celebration that
kicks off the holiday season.

Downtownis also acenter for sporting events.

The Penguins, the local professional hockey
team that boasts one more Stanley Cup than its
rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, reside Downtown
at the newly erected Consol Energy Center.

The Penguins share the Consolwith the Pitts-
burgh Power, a member of the Arena Football
League. The game plays at a much faster pace
than ordinary football because it makes use of
a ﬁeld that’s only 50 yards long.

The Consol Energy Center is also a venue
wheremany big—name artists come to perform.
Musicians Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and Lady
Gaga have both performed at the Consol.

Teddi Salsgiver, another student at the Art
Institute of Pittsburgh, said she enjoys walking
around the city to take photographs of Pitts-
burgh’s “fantastic” architecture. She said a com-
mon misconception about the city is that it takes
money to have fun.

“I heard from people that there’s nothing to
do in Pittsburgh if you don’t have any money,”
Salsgiver said. “But a lot of the events are free.”

She said that down by the point —where the
Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form
the Ohio River -— there are many free events,
such as concerts and festivals. Furthermore, stu-
dents can ﬁnd free salsa or cabaret dancing les-
sons at various places scattered around the town.

Although Salsgiver regularly travels through
the city and knows many of its intricacies, she
said there is so much she has yet to discover. She
added that for students to get the ﬁill experience
of Downtown, they need to check out the area
for themselves.

“You really want to look around,” she said.
“There are so many little things in Pittsburgh
you wont ﬁnd unless you explore.” Q

“We love talking to people, and we’ve made
a lot of friends.”

Abraham said the business sees “some-
thing new every week,” recalling one par-
ticular incident in which two roommates
ran under the counter and around the
kitchen, ﬁghting and yelling at each other
in Spanish. He said he called the police and
held the two off each other with his uncle
until they arrived. ,

Both restaurants — ﬁlled with college
students on any given weekend night --
said they can easily shovel out ﬁve hundred
or more pizzas in a night.

Oakland’s nightlife has come under in-

creased criticism recently, (,I_qu;ncilrna,n

Bruce Kraus said lastlfall 
an abnormallyhigh numberifofcomiplaints
from South Oakland residents concerning
students’ late-night conduct. The com-
plaints prompted Kraus to set up infor-
mal meetings with concerned residents
to address ways to ameliorate the student
revelry situation. C

so far, the problem hasn’t resulted in
any formal action taken besides«ensur—
ing that students are properly educated
on their expected behavior. All incoming
students must recite the “Pitt Promise,”
which obligates students to uphold Uni-
versity expectations and commits them to

the advancement of learning and service
to society. V
Sophomore Angela DeCandia said that
she appreciates the Oakland atmosphere
for its activeness. Pitt’s heavy involve-
ment in the larger Oakland community
has encouraged her to take a more active
role in the neighborhood by engaging in
activities such as Pitt’s Project Oakland
in March, in which students split up into
groups and pick up trash around Oakland.

Just across the street, at 1305 East Carson
St., is Pittsburgh Guitars, a store lined with
more than 250 guitars. The owner and pro-
prietor, John Bechtold, worked in the store
for 10 years before "purchasing it from the
previous owner last year. He said the store
is more of a place to hang out and talk about
music than just a business.

going to try and sell you something,”
Bechtold said. “We like talking music.”

Many famous musicians have passed
through the store, and Bechtold said Kurt
Cobain, the deceased frontman of Nirvana,
once bought a guitar there. The ‘store doesn’t
advertise, so many of the prices are lower
than other stores. Bechtold said if the store
advertised, it would haveto set its prices
according to the manufacturer’s limitations.

Carson Street is packed with bars of all
shapes and sizes, and they are not just for
those older than 21. Some places, such as
Hookah Bookah and Sphinx Cafe, oifer hoo-
kahs for tobacco’ smoking to those students
older than 18.

looking to celebrate their 21st birthday.

Pat Walling, 25, a resident of South Side
for three years, enjoys the atmosphere of
South Side, particularly after 7 p.m. He said
that for someone looking for something to
do, South Side is the place to go.

“You can ﬁnd a dive bar if you want to
relax or you can go out and get crazy,” Wall-
ing said. “[South Side] caters to whatever
you want.” '

Of course, the inﬂux of bars has also made
it a center for criticism. After a few years and
complaints from South Side residents, Coun-
cilman Bruce Kraus has been examining the
revelry that’s giving the neighborhood a bad
name because of overﬂowing trash and crime
traced back to intoxicated people.

In April, Mayor Luke Ravenstahljoined
Kraus to forge a partnership with Respon-
sible Hospitality Institute, a nonprofit
consultant group known for helping cities
manage safe and lively hospitality districts.
Under the contract with the city, RHI will
conduct a nine-month study to examine
the effects of Pittsburgh’s nightlife in three
neighborhoods — South Side, Downtown
and Lawrenceville. -

Recently, representatives from various
organizations voted to create a Neighbor-
hood Improvement District that would in-
volve imposing a special tax on residents
in the South Side to pay for litter cleanup,
safety patrols andother services.

The hope for the effort is to create a plea-
surable experience for everyone during the
day and night. I.

Gov.Tom Corbett visited Pitt in March this year to defend his budget
cuts. Kenny Ong, Senior Staff Photographer

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett
came to Pitt in March to defend his
steep budget cuts to higher educa-
tion. Angry students asked him
questions to pin down why higher
education was the target of the state
budget for the second year in a row.
“I was elected to govern and
make tough decisions, and I came
here to answer your questions to-
day,” Corbett said, as some audience
members shook their heads and a
few shouted back. “I understand that
you are angry.”
In Corbett’s proposed budget

For 20 years, Mullaney’s Harp

music and food lovers to come
together and enjoy Irish culture.
Located on the corner of Penn Av-
enue and 24th Street, the Irish pub
isffiime to different music events.

“Professional groups comevto

Every Tuesday night, profes-

different groups play acoustic mu-
sic. Musicians bring life to the pub

out of the four Pennsylvania state-

related universities — which in-
clude Pitt, Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln — stand to lose 30 percent
of state funding from the previous
year. Lincoln, by far the smallest of
the four schools in terms of student
population, doesn’t face a funding
cut. In response, Pitt student leaders
have mobilized the student body in
order to highlight Pitt’s importance
to the state of Pemisylvania.

Last year, Corbett proposed a 50
percent decrease in  toward
the state-related universities but set-
tled for 19 percent when the budget
was ﬁnally passed. Pitt’s tuition went
up 8.5 percent for in-state students
and 4 percent for out-of-state stu-

Regan mentioned that the pu

In March, Corbett discussed the
cuts with Pitt students and admin-
istrators at Pancakes and Politics,
an event organized by Pitt’s Gradu-
ate & Professional Student Associa-
tion. Corbett told the audience that
in light‘ of the state’s budget deﬁcit, ‘
tough choices needed to be made.

Corbett inherited a $4 billion
deﬁcit when he took ofﬁce in Janu-
ary 2011, so he proposed a lean $27
billion 2011-2012 budget, which in-
cluded cuts targeted at higher educa-
tion. He passed another slimming
budgetfor 2012-2013 that again took
aim at universities.

Corbett stressed that he was not
an opponent of higher education in
the state, saying that public educa-
tion accounted for 40 percent of
state funding. Corbett used the ex-
ample of a pizza to demonstrate the
portion of the budget dedicated to it.

“Pennsylvania looks at education
as its No. 1 priority,” Corbett said to
a group of students on Pitt’s campus
on March 16. “When the pizza pie
goes from an 8-inch pie to a 6-inch
pie, you still have that percentage,
but not enough money.”

Corbett also said raising taxes
to counteract the deﬁcit wasn’t an
option because of the national eco-
nomic downturn.

tempting to mobilize students in
order to speak out against the cuts.
SGB Presidentjames Landreneau

said earlier this year that Pitt Day 2

in Harrisburg attracted 500 advo-
cates, 130 of which were Pitt stu-
dents. Students met with legislators
to voice their disapproval of the cuts
inthe effortto rally legislators on the
side of students. He added that SGB
received a positive response from
legislators during the event. ' '

“Overall, I think everyone was
really pleased with how it went,”
Landreneau said. “We received a lot
of positive feedback from students
meeting with legislators, and I think
this shows how important it is to
continue this ﬁght.”

SGB also began a letter-writing I

campaign two weeks prior to Pitt
Day in Harrisburg, in which stu-
dents had the opportunity to write
letters to their legislators. In a pro-
gram called “1787 Advocates,” SGB
hoped to have 1,787 students write
letters. The number represented the
year when Pitt received its charter.

Despite the lull in student activ-
ism against the cuts because of the
disruption on Pitt’s campus due to
bomb threats in the latter part of
the spring semester, student leaders
continue spreading the message of
Pitt’s impact on the city of Pittsburgh
and state of Pennsylvania;

Robert Beecher, chairman of
SGB’s Governmental Relations com-

tlgtltﬂst sttzte hudget cuts to hzgher education

mittee, said state subsidies allow for
high—quality, affordable education
for in-state residents. He added that
under last year’s budget, state ap-
propriations provided $4,500 per
student, and $9,000 for in-state
students. ‘ ~

In response to the cuts, which
Beecher called “tremendously frus-
trating,” SGB created the slogan “No
More Cuts, Keep Pitt Public.”

SGB’s slogan reﬂects a growing
worry among Pitt’s administration:
the possibility of Pitt becoming a
private university. ' .

Pitt Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg previously said the cuts toward

the four state-related schools are

pushing the schools toward priva-
tization. _
Charles McLaughlin, Pitt’s Direc-
tor of Commonwealth Relations,
also said earlier in the semester
that a change to private status could
end Pitt’s practice of differentiating
tuition between in-state and out-of-
state students. He also said that the
cuts would most likely spell the end
for smaller academic programs,
community outreach and Pitt’s re-
gional campuses. _
“The chancellor loves the public
mission, but this is our eighth cut
in 12 years,” McLaughlin said in
March. “To maintain the integrity
of the University and the strength
of University, we have to consider
not being afﬁliated with the state.” I

Each year, nine students are given $2.3 mil-
lion with a simple directive: give it away. This
is the task of the Student Government Board.
SGB is made up of nine students — eight

‘ each year by their. fellow students. In ad-
dition to its members, the Board is also
made up of seven committees, including
Community Outreach and Governmental

Relations, which take on projects related

to their speciﬁc ﬁelds. The purpose of the
Board — whose oiﬁce is located on the ninth
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union + is to act
as a liaison between the administration and
the student body. .
p SGB’s main responsibility is to dole out
the Student Activities Fund, a $2.3 million
pool derived from the $80 Student Activities
Fee that each non-' College of General Studies
undergraduate student pays each semester.
Under the advice of the Allocations
Committee, SGB meets publicly on Tuesday
nights in Nordy’s Place to discuss how to

allocate its funds to student organizations
that have made requests. Clubs might re-
quest money to go to a conference or bring
in a guest speaker. Club sports might ask
for money to purchase new equipment or
play in a tournament. SGB has the ﬁnal say
on how much, if any, money these student
organizations receive.

But at the beginning of each SGB public
meeting, Board members discuss their proj-
ects, which are aimed at improving students’
experiences at Pitt. Board members and
committee chairpersons rattle off meetings
they’ve attended, people they’ve talked to
and progress they’ve made on their term
projects. ;,

These projects are what the Board mem-
bers based‘ their November campaigns on;
they spend most of their time on the Board
following through with these ideas. Im-

provements Board members have made in '

the past include implementing a GPS system
on Pitt shuttles and establishing a resource
center in the Hillman Library for tests such
as the GRE, LSAT and MCAT. ‘

“I ﬁnd it essential to remember that the

students elected us because of the ideas we
had to‘ help better the University,” Board
member Natalie Rothenberger said. A

In addition to the projects with which
they campaigned, Board members pick up
side projects during their terms. If a student
comes in with a particular idea or concern,
Board members may help get it addressed
by the administration.

They also contributeto general SGB proj-

"ects such as Pitt Day in Harrisburg and the

new 1787 Letter Writing Campaign, a coor-
dinated effort spearheaded by SGB President
James Landreneau to encourage students to
write to legislators about Pitt’s budget issue.

Individual Board members’ projects in-
clude that of Gordon Louderback, for ex-
ample, who has been working on bringing
wireless internet to the dorms since October
of last semester — before he was elected to
the Board. ‘

“I wanted to get started early, so that if I
got elected, I could hit the ground running,”
Louderback said. '

Louderback recently had a meeting with
Kathy Humphrey, Pitt’s vice provost and
clean of students, and was told to work on
a proposal to present this summer.

Louderback said the biggest obstacles to
the project have been cost and security, since
it would be more difficult to crack down on
illegal ﬁle sharing under a wireless system.

Board member Zoe Samudzi ran on the

Summer 2012 I The Pitt News | vwx/vv.pitinevvs.eem

Mark Nordenberg a family man, Pitt’s chancellor

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg is a man
devoted to two things. 9

‘jg/Iy life, in the main, consists of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and my family,” Norden-
berg said. “If you asked if I have any hobbies,
I would say the answer to that questionis no.”

He doesn’t ﬁsh, like his father did, and
he doesn’t collect stamps, but Nordy — as
he is affectionately known by students at
Pitt —— is an avid reader of newspapers and
magazines. He has always been interested
in current events, and he has always been
focused on work. .

L Nordenberg, whose office is in room 107
of the Cathedral of Learning, has served as
Pitt-.’v_s_, chancellor since 1995, but he was in-
volved with the University long before that.
He joined the law faculty in 1977 and has
held various positions throughout the Uni-
versity during his tenure, including dean of
the School of Law, interim provost and senior
vice chancellor for academic affairs.

Now, his duties include serving as the rep-
resentative of the students, staff, faculty and
administration to the Board of Trustees —— a
group of people who meet to decide how to
advance the University. As Pitt’s 17th chancel.-
lor, Nordenberg sets challenging goals for the

University and monitors its progress. And
while he works to improve the University as
an institution, he builds relationships with
students, faculty and the community.
During Nordenberg’s time as chancel-
lor, the University has undergone signiﬁ-
cant structural changes and has had many
students receive awards for various levels of
academic excellence. , V.
L In 1999, the University demolished Pitt
Stadium, the former home of Pitt’s football,
basketball and other athletic teams. Since the
demolition, Pitt erected the Petersen Events

Center, the home of the basketball team and ’

a venue for non—athletic events, such as con—
certs and performances. _
Furthermore,,University housing ex-

’ panded duringthe cha'ncellor’s tenure.

Bouquet Gardens and Panther Hall joined
Pitt’s housing ranks, while a former version

of Pennsylvania Hall was demolished and ‘

then reconstructed.

And since Nordenberg took the reins,
four Pitt undergrads have won the Rhodes
Scholarship, a. prestigious award given to
students who displayacademic,excellence,
commitment to their peers and strong char-
acter. Numerous other students have earned
Marshall and Goldwater scholarships.

Kathy Humphrey:
Dean of Students  
and a students’ dean

Josh Won
Stayjf Wrz'ter

During a semester riddled with bomb

threats, Kathy Humphrey was a constant A

voice of calm on campus — a testament to
her place in students’ hearts as one of the
most prominent and well-liked members
of Pitt,’s administration.

“Yes, I tried to be there,” Humphrey

said. “The students let me know it was
important for them to know they weren’t
alone. Student Affairs is just trying to keep
them as comfortable as possible.”

James Landreneau, the president of
Student Government Board, said Hum?
phrey practically lived on campus during
the constant threats.

“Even-at 4 a.m. [during bomb threat
evacuations], she was there to support
students in the tough times,” Landreneau
said. -

With seven years under her belt as
the vice provost and clean of students,
Humphrey has been the force driving the
Division of Student Affairs, providing
support to students through services for

‘health, legal matters, counseling, career
H and leadership development, disabilities,

residence life and immigration. But while
her workload is diverse, one thing remains
central: her devotion to Pitt’s students.

Shawn Brooks, the associate dean of
Residence Life who has known Humphrey
for more than 10 years, said in an email
that there is a special trait that makes
Humphrey excel at her job.

“She loves students, and they love her,”
he said. “Unlike deans at other institu-
tions across the country, Dr. Humphrey
is here on campus late into the evening
most nights so that she can interact with

Kathy Humphrey considers her devotion
to students to be her most important

her students.”

Part of Student Affairs’ initiative to
create more well—rounded and culturally
enlightened students is the relatively new

ated by Humphrey, the program endorses

lies to performances, and by attending

the right of professors to teach their classes
how they see best. Samudzi altered her plan

’ to give students the Thursday and Friday be-

fore ﬁnals weeks off so they can concentrate
on their studies. A

Samudzi tried to get the Academic Calen-
dar Committee to convene a special meeting
about the issue on April 18, but the discus-
sion was postponed until the beginning of
September.

“Hopefully we can try to come to some
kind.ofag1?e“ement that will affect the upcom-

Board members Rothenberger and Me-

‘ gan McGrath both ran on a promise to give

student organizations “a centralized ad-
vertising option on the my.pitt website,”
Rothenberger said in an email.

They decided to work together on the is-
sue and created —— with the help of Comput-
ing Services’and Systems Development -
the Student Events Calendar, a platform for
student groups to get the message out about
their events. The calendar was added onto

Junior Olivia Hallas sat cross—legged onthe ﬂoor
of the Cathedral Commons. Unlike the others
students in the commons, who were seated at
the wooden tables scattered around the room,
her attention wasn’t held by assigned readings.
Smiling, she sat between two dogs.

From 7to 8 pm. every Tuesday night, the ﬁrst
ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning is occupied by
a blend of students and canines. Participating in
an event that is part of the College Canine pro-

‘ gram, volunteers fromthe Western Pennsylvania
Humane Society bring about 20 therapy dogs on
campus to provide students and members of the
public an opportunity to de—stress and socialize.

With both handspetting different dogs, Hal- .
las balanced her attention between the canines
and a conversation with the dogs’ owners.

“This is the best—kept secret on campus,”
she said.

The Western Pennsylvania Humane Society
ﬁrst implemented the therapy dog program
at Pitt eight years ago. After hosting the event
outside of the William Pitt Union for two years,

several of these events, students can earn

an OCC certiﬁcate when they graduate.
“The OCC is about saying to students,

‘while you’re developing inside the class-

room, make sure you’re developing outside’

of the classroom,’” she said. For her, the
program is about embracing the college
experience and cherishing every moment.
Cherishing moments is something she
strives to do in her life, as well. ~
“That.is howl live my life every day — I
try by investing in the students. They are

why I exist,” she said. Having recently ~

been devastated by the passing of a close
nephew, Humphrey said that embracing

life is more important to her now than

ever. .
“Whenever it is my time to go, I want
to say I lived a fulllife. Yo,u.don’t have to

wait to do that.;,You canlive every single

day,” she said. " ' . _ .

Summer Rothrock, the assistant di-
rector in cross-cultural and leadership
development, said the dean can be seen
wholeheartedly embracing this lifestyle.

“Dr. Humphrey lives her values every
day in her work. She leads by example and
is a role model for her staff and students,”
Rothrock wrote in an email. “Her person-
ality is contagious. She is excited about
her work. It shows in her dedication and
commitment to the University.” ‘

The dean also regularly hosts activities
for students with free food and her per-
sonal counsel at her monthly Dean’s Hour
— usually hosted at the William Pitt Union.

“One of the reasons I have Dean’s Hour
is so I can hear the concerns of the stu-
dents,” she said. “I don’t want to find out
things secondhand — I love working with
students.”

This is part of what makes her popular
with the student body; so popular that, for
three years running, students have voted

. her to be the Pitt Administrator of the

year in The Pitt News’ “Best of””edition

in the fall. i
Kenyon Bonner, director of student

life and associate dean of students, has

worked with her for seven years, and, in_

that time, regularly foundher walking

around campus participating in student-

life or chatting in elevators with students.

Humphrey said, “I can tell how students

are doing just by. one elevator ride.”

"John Lea, an assistant dean and busi-
ness manager in Student Affairs, has
worked with her for six years. He said that
few encounter Humphrey without having
theirlives touched personally.

Erika Hess, who graduated last year
with a degreein applied developmental
psychology, is one of the many students
whom Humphrey has impacted. A

She particularly recalled a visit from '

the dean after the renovation of Amos

Hall three ‘years ago.,..w.hen, her sorority,

Delta Delta Delta, decorated a suite for
an open house.
“She was so amazing. We talked for a

while, and she said we were her favorite‘
suite. She toured all the ﬂoors,” Hess said.
What impressed Hess the most was

Humphrey’s intimacy.

“Whenever we’ve talked, it’s always just
been in snippets,” Hess said. “But every
time I’ve seen her, she’s remembered who
I was. She even remembered my name at
the OCC recognition dinner and awards

- ceremony.”

“That is how I live
my_ life every“ day —
I try by investing in
“the students. They
avrewhiy I exist.”

Kathy Humphrey

Kristin Kutchak, who just graduated
with a degree in chemical engineering, also
had ‘several opportunities to interact with
the dean as a First Year Mentor helping
freshmen get on track with college goals
in a program called First Year Experience.

“She knew we all worked for First Year
Experience, and she always thanked us for
our work, even though she was the one tak- -
ing thetime to check us out,” Kutchak said.‘
“She wouldinteract with students attend-
ing our events, asking them if they were

having a good time and stuff like that.”

Kutchak consideredthe dean’s presence
to be a rare privilege not common at most

universities.

“To me, it seems like if you ask people
at other schools about their dean of stu-
dents, they’ll be like, ‘I didn’t know we
had one.’ But here, a majority of students

know her,” she said.

A family woman herself, the dean has
two twin boys, Daniel and David, who are

also Pitt students. —

“I enjoy being a mom; I enjoy being
the dean. I enjoy being a-wife — I’ve been
one for 27 years. And I even still like him,”

Humphrey said with a laugh.

Asked whether she sees herself as a
maternal substitute for students away
from home, she responded with a mix of

feelings.

“I never really think about it, so it
must be an automatic mode. I just try to’
be someone who’ll listen; someone who is
part of the administration who’s pulling

for the students to do well.”~

However, she does feel an intimate con-

. nection with/Pitt... A

“There. is something very special at
Pitt,” the Dean said. “I will tell you: I truly

love Pitt students. I love‘ them.” I

Marsha Robbins, the director of humane
education at the Western Pennsylvania Humane
Society, said students ﬁequently walk straight
through the event because they don’t realize
the animals are trained therapy dogs and are
there to interact with people.

Maui, a 6-year-old poodle-Lebanese mix,
is a senior member of the program and has ac-
companied Robbins to the Cathedral since the
program moved into the building. Like many of
the other dogs, Maui began hertherapy training
at 14 months old.

owners in the program, attended training
classes at the Western Pennsylvania Humane
Society and passed a comprehensive test to
earn them certiﬁcation from Therapy Dogs In-
ternational (TDI). According to the TDI testing
requirements brochure, the 15—step test includes
portions suchas “acceptingaﬁiendly stranger”
and exhibiting calm “reactions to distractions.”
Robbins said that Maui and many of the
other dogs are rescued animals, andwhile Maui
was ‘originally viewed as untrainable and out
of control, she is now a “bad dog gone good.”
Through the certiﬁcation course, the dogs

are trained to handle loud noises, remain calm V
as countless unfamiliar people enter and exit an.

area, remain desensitized to adaptive equip-
ment such as wheelchairs and remain multicul-

turally sensitive. Such skills allow the animals
to adapt to the atmosphere of the University.
“You could beinatotalfunkand come here,

nottalk, and that’s totally ﬁne because the dogs_

will wag their tails and love you anyway,” Rob-
bins said. “Or you could come here in a total
ﬁink and they'll take you right out of it with
unconditional attention and affection.”

Dr. Tevya Zukor, Director of the University
Counseling Center, said in an email thatfor stu-
dents, any time of transition is a time of stress.

“For incoming freshmen, there is often a .

sense of excitement and anticipation about be-
ingawayfrom home, possiblyforthe ﬁrsttime,
and starting to live more independently. As
exciting as it ‘is, it can also be highly stressful,”
he said. “Many students willbe away from their

 

  

' dog champion.

closestfriends and family. Theywillbe adjusting
to "a new academic and personal environment
without the usual support systems intheir life.”

. Engaging with the therapy dogs or partici-
pating in other programs offered to students
may help incoming students to make the transi-
tion. Robbins said thatvaluable ﬁiendships are
created through studen ’ interactions with the
group and cited trends that students often pick
their favorite dogs to visit each week.

“Many people ﬁnd that being around ani-
mals has a calming effect on them,” Zukor said.
“However, stress levels can also be reduced
by connecting to new peers, exploring a new
environment, and embracing the reasons these
changes are occurring.” ,

"Zukor said that students éan also take advan-
tage of other opportunities to help reduce stress,
such as community programming provided for
the residence halls, speciﬁc groups and work-
shops for stress management provided by the
counseling center and various clubs focused on
shared interests. .

Some students dedicate portions of their

. weekly schedules to routinely visit the dogs,

while others choose to wander in when they

canﬁnd the time.

Senior Rachel -LaMarco occasionally wan-
ders up from the basement of the Cathedral -
where she works inthe Language Media Center
— when she can ﬁnd a few minutes to spare.

“WhenIﬁrst saw them last year, Iwas really
confused why there were dogs everywhere,”
she said. “But now I visit because they are your
pets away from home, and they’re adorable.”

LaMarco said the program provides a nice
stress reliever and acts as a positive distraction
from the real reason that most people walk to
the Cathedral in the evenings — to study. V

Sophomore _IshaVasudeva originally attend-
ed the event after seeingaflier for the program
and now chooses to occasionally stop by after

« her class ﬁnishes inthe Cathedral While shewas

"originally surprised to see the dogs, Vasudeva
said that sheanow expects them and that the
animals provide a environment for those
with or without pets at home.

“I don’t haveadog at home, butlfeellikethe
people who do especially enjoy it,” Vasudeva
said. -
Pitt’s collection of therapy dogs even in-'
cludes a bona ﬁde celebrity. George, a 216
pound, 6-year-old Mastiff and senior member
of the program, has acted as a trained therapy
dog since he was 14 months old.

Amy Coglio, George’s owner, said that in ad-
’dition to his duties as a therapy dog, he showed
at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show, was
crownedtheNo. 5 mastiffinthe countryin2009
among a rank of competitive mastiffs for the
year and holds titles as an international show

Despite his pedigree and accomplishments,
George spends his 'Duesday evenings alternating
between sitting up and lying on the Cathedral
Commons ﬂoor, allowing all who enter the
building to stop by-and pet him.

NORDY

Pittsburgh ties

Born onjuly 12, 1948, in Duluth, Minn.,
Nordenberg served as his father’s assistant
for household projects and auto repairs as a
kid. Nordenberg didn’t pride himself on any
particular skills that could aid his father with
such projects, but the future chancellor did
serve as a tool—grabber and wrench-retriever
when they worked together.

Nordenberg moved to Pittsburgh in his
teenage years and graduated from North

Allegheny High School. Hestarted his aca-
demic career at Thiel College, a liberal arts
school associated with the Lutheran Church
in Greenville, Pa., and it was there that Nor—
denberg met his wife, Nikki Pirillo.

Mr. and Mrs. Nordenberg had a biology
class together. During the ﬁrst week, she

‘ introduced herself to him and eventually

began trying indirectly and unsuccessfully

V to get him to ask her out. Eventually, she

switched her tactics.

“I stole his biology lab book. I just" put
my books on it, picked it up and left with it,”
Mrs. Nordenberg said. “I told him, ‘I have
your book.’\And he said, ‘Oh, why don’t you
bring it to class?’ And I said, ‘Why don’t you
come get it?”’

She said that there wasn’t much to do
in Greenville, so they spent a lot of time
walking and talking. More than 40 years
later, the couple has three children and three
grandchildren.

The chancellor said he always made it
a point to stay involved in his childrens’
lives. His career in academia allowed him
to schedule his time around special events,
so he could make it to plays, parent—teacher
conferences and athletic events. He also had
other methods of assuring himself that he
wouldattend their events.

“I felt that ifI signed up as a coach or
agreed that I was going to be an official of
one kind or another, it made it harder to say,

‘Well, I’m pretty busy today. I’ll get to the

game or the meet next week,”’ Nordenberg
said. “I had a commitment, and actually had
a series of commitments, so that was one
form of discipline I brought to my profes-
sional life.” '

Now his kids are grown and spread out .

across the country and the world. His daugh-
ter Erin works at Pitt, and his sons Michael

‘ and Carl are currently in South Korea and

New York, respectively.
Team of professionals, friends '

In his professional life‘, Nordenberg is
well respected by his co-workers. Members
of his administration call him diplomatic
and political. As head of the University,
Nordenberg acts asa representative for
the institution in all public matters, a job
which earned him a base salary of $561,000
in 2012. '

Executive Vice Chancellor Jerome Co-
chran was once a student of Nordenberg’s
in Pitt’s law school, but today, he works with
his former teacher. Cochran said that Nor-
denberg has an incredible memory and can
remember minor, details about conversa-
tions he has with people. A

Cochran said this ability transferred into
the classroom, and Nordenberg kept the
class ihterested in the topic of discussion.

“There wasn’t a waste of a minute in his
class,” Cochran said. “There were never any a
side tracks. He stayed focused onthe lesson
of the day.” . 4

Because of_his many yearsand daily life
spent at Pitt, most of Nordenberg’s friends '
come from within the University.

James Maher, who was the provost and
vice chancellor from 1994 until 2010, has
grown close with the chancellor over the
years. Their relationship extends outside
of the University, and they’ve spent signiﬁ—
cant time together traveling andat social

functions. ‘’

Maher said that he and the chancellor
tell similar types of stories, and that even
during social functions, the’ chancellor re-
mains focused. - ‘

“He and I tend to tell stories that illus-
trate the pointthat we are telling at the
time,” Maher said. “Sometimes [the stories]
are funny, some think they are jokes, but
they are also relevant to the discussion.”

Maher added that the chancellor mainly

. focuses on the University and the challenges
associated with running it, and that Norden- '

berg has built a solid team to maintain the
quality of the University. ‘

‘ Nordenberg takes a lot of pride in the
current state of Pitt, and he said that his
proudest accomplishment is the shift in per-
ception of the University during his 17 years
as its chancellor. But he doesn’t take all the
credit for himself. He said the University
wouldn’t be the way it is today if he didn’t
have the support of those around him.

- “What drove much of this was putting
together an absolutely spectacular team that
was committed to the advancement of the
University of Pittsburgh,” Nordenberg said.
“[A team] that was unrelenting in the pursuit
of these goals in good times and bad.” i

OPINIONS  

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

The Pitt experience: Learn to stop worrying

Matt Schaff
Colummst

Other freshmen at other universities have
only ho-hum, average reasons to be excited
about their ﬁrst years: professors, parties,
independence, etc. Pitt freshmen are differ-
ent. That’s because no other freshman class
has the coveted, theoretical fortune of going
to a University that allows them to interact
daily with bomb threats. It’s a jackpot that
raises your intellectual well—being at the
same time as your blood pressure.

But this privilege comes not without chal-
lenge. Making a limited exception only for
ﬁnals week, Pitt’s administration decreed
this past semester that it would treat every
single emailed bomb threat — there were
more than 100 + as a serious emergency,
no matter the lack of hard evidence or the

W amount of the ensuing disruption. Thus, in

order to make the most out of the unique
educational experience, students had to
learn how to optimally adapt to “email ter-
rorists” who were now capable of bringing
their University to a standstill before stop-
ping the threats at the end of April. A
In the event that Pitt continues its nego-

tiate—its—academic—values—with—terrorists
policies (i.e. campus screenings, text no-
tiﬁcations and evacuations in response to
all threats), the incoming class may need to
similarly ﬁgure out its best moves, especially
without any reason to believe the probabil—.
ity of another bomb threat quagmire has

somehow subsided — anyone can still send .

anonymous emails, and Pitt has not changed
its general response policies. To prevent
time wasted on reinventing wheels, here’s a
boi1ed—down advice list reﬂecting the major
bomb— threat adaptation strategies proven
effective by clever upperclassmen:

1. Send your stuff home if it can’t all
ﬁt in a satchel.

What a no—brainer —— as a resident of a
freshman dorm, you can never be sure your
room will be available from minute to min-
ute. When dorm evacuations can happen at
any time of day, newcomers would be foolish
to stock their rooms with extraneous items
that only the bomb—snifﬁng dogs would have
guaranteed time to use while they search the
rooms (unless you bring chew toys).

2. Bring a pillow and jammies to class.

With your University liable to repeatedly
evacuate you from your bed sheets at 3 a.m. ,

THE STAMATTACK

The five stages of your Market Central relationship

Nick Stamatakis
Assz'stant Opinions Editor

There are supposedly ﬁve stages of grief that

one must traverse to achieve a sense of peace
after a loss: denial, anger, bargaining, depres-
sion and acceptance. . .

Similarly, you will ﬁndthere are ﬁve stag-
es" of your relationship with Market Central
that you will traverse before you can achieve
a sense of peace with Pitt’s on-campus food.
May the road rise up to meet you.

Stage One: Utter confusion

Designing a dining area to sit comfortably
sit diners beneath three circular buildings
could ‘not have been easy. Upon seeing the
ﬂoor plan of the dining area — two largely
windowless squares squashed together, all
mixed with support beams and curved walls
—— architects and designers of the 2007 reno-
vation of Pitt’s main dining hall must have
known they had their work cut out for them.
The plan they came up with is what you see
today: a Taco Bell/Quick Zone come—and—go
area on one side and an all-you-can-eat buf-
fet smorgasbord known as Market Central on
the other. > ‘

user feel like a

goldfish swimming ~

 throughl a maze

,with glass walls. ,

‘The ﬁnal product makesithe new user feel '

. like a goldﬁsh swimming througha maze with
all—glass walls: You might know where you
need to go, but you’ll probably bump into a
ton of people or at least ﬁnd yoursélfpressed
up against some table that inatplicably seems

to cross in front of a walking area on the way_ ,
there. To a new student, parallel lines seem to ’

converge. You can walk in a straight line and
— somehow still end up where you began.‘

Furthermore, spoken directions become
meaningless in Market CentrEscher. Saying
that you’ll be in the far back corner could
realistically send a. friend to four separate
places. I dare you to try to point to Forbes
Avenue fromany spot inside. Eventually you
will learn to communicate biypexpressing a
relationship to a speciﬁc food area — 12 feet

Summer 2012 I The Pitt News | V\/\/\/\/V.plllﬂ@WS.COiTl

from the salad bar, ‘etc. — but until you learn
this, you wander in utter conﬁision.

Stage Two: Screaming excitement

Now that you can ﬁnd your way through
the maze, you are suddenly blown away by
the dizzying array of options. At home, you
got to pick from one thing to eat; at high

school lunch, you had about three options. At ‘

Market Central, you can eat from six themed
areas, with dozens of items available. Once
you realize that many of the options feature

cuisine from different countries, you soon
ﬁnd yourselfcomparing the dining hall to Ep-
cot. Eagerly, you begin searching for a giant,
costumed mascot.

But more importantly, with a‘ constant
supply of burgers, wraps and fries, you expe-
rience an ever—present calm . If one of your
crazy new dining experiences isn’t pleasant,
you know you will always have a back up.

Stage Three: Bargaining 7

With that constant supply-of burgers,

49

wraps and fries slowly forming the bulk of
your diet, you have now come to the realiza-
tion that the international options offered at
Market Central often come with a digestively
challenging dessert course._You realize your
Tier 1, Plan A, 225-swipe meal plan might not
be very cost—effective any more. Suddenly,
simply deciding what to eat becomes a"]strat-
egy session:

Donal? esta la éiélioteczz? Ledm ( orreleam) at foreign [cmguczge to respond

Naomi Borrebach

\ 0pz'nz"o7zs Editor

Freshman year is the perfect time to take large,
introductory classes where you can alternate
between going on Pinterest, napping and eat-
ing snacks, while occasionally soaking up some
knowledge about paintings or planets. Right?

 4 While giant introductory classes serve a

purpose — like ﬁilfilling those weird Creative
Expression or Non-Westem Foreign Culture re-

quirements — you might want to spice up your

days with something a little more exciting than
watching professors struggle with multimedia

equipment or staring at PowerPoint presenta-

tions typed in Comic Sans. How do you do that? .

Take a foreign language class.
Studying a foreign language will take you
out of the Intro to Everything trap that so many
" freshmen unforttmately fall into. While ‘large, in-
troductory classes provide a lot of information,
they often do not give students much oppor-
tunity for interaction with professors or other
classmates. It is also easy to zone out during a
longlecture: listeningand taking notes may not
be conducive to active learning.
In contrast, most language classes are small
(one of mine only had three students, but it’s

more common to have around 20) so you’ll actu-
ally meet other people, and your professorwill
get to know you as an person because of the high
degree of interaction in the classroom. Also,
because a sequence of language courses takes
a couple of semesters, you’ll probably stick with
the same core group of people in your classes.
Especially for students who are‘ accustomed
to large classes ﬁill of strangers, taking classes
with a core group of people can provide both a
sense of community and people you knowwell
enough to study with before exams. I

_ You might even have the same professor
for a few semesters, and you’ll develop a closer

relationship with that professor because they’ll
have been with you for an extended period of
time. Getting to know a professor is valuable
when you need advice on courses to take and
study—abroad scholarships to apply for — and
they’re helpﬁil when you need letters of recom-
mendation for those scholarship applications.
On the less academic and more cultural side
of things, foreign languages mean foreign food,
foreign music, foreign movies and foreign art.
You’ll be able to watch foreign movies without
subtitles and’ discover more varieties of intema-
tional food here in Pittsburgh. And you can get
more from a study abroad experience by com-
municating with people in their own language
and having some cultural awareness.
Speaking of cultural awareness, learning
a new language means gainingla new-found
feeling of authority to talk about it to your (inter-
ested?) friends and relatives. If you pickaprop-
erly exotic language (try Quechua or Icelandic),
the majority of your friends and relatives will

_ probablynotbeabletocontradictyourcultural

knowledge, even if you get some of the details
wrong because your professor explained them
inthe target language. ’

The foreign language classes offered at Pitt

" provide a lot of options and ﬂexibility. Pitt offers

many “less-commonly taught” languages, such
as Hungarian, Persian, and Irish Gaelic. Many
foreign language courses can be combined with
history or culture classes that are applicable
toward earning a certiﬁcate (which is similar to

l a minor) in intemaﬁonally-themed disciplines
such as Global Studies, Western or Eastern Eu- .

ropean Studies, Asian Studies, orAmerican Sign
Language. Pitt also offers intensive language
study summer programs in some_East Asian
and Eastern European languages.

Although foreign language study is certainly
rewarding, there are also a lot of challenges
involved. It requires a large investment of time,
and  may be small at ﬁrst. Often, foreign-

language learners are motivated by a larger goal '

of, say, being able to read esoteric literature in its
original language. While these goals are worth-
while, realize that elementary or intermediate
language learning is focused on the practical:
telling time, ordering tea in cafes, telling direc-
tions, etc. If you start Russian 1 with the goal of

‘ reading“AnnaKarenina”inRussian, you might

be disappointed. But ifyour goal for Russianl is
to use basic Russian to communicate, the class
can be a rewarding experience, and you may
eventually become skilled enough to read ad-
vanced literature. Also, foreign language classes
generally require signiﬁcant preparation out-
side of class, which can be a downside for those
with demanding majors (orfor those who have
demanding movie—watching schedules).

Even if you place out of Pitt’s foreign l
guage requirement because of your years prac-
ticingforeign swearwords onyourﬁiends inthe
back row of your high school’s Spanish classes,

' you should strongly consider continuingwith a

foreign language or trying a new one. Despite
the challenges, the academic, social and cultural
beneﬁts from college—level foreign-language
study make it entirely worth ﬁtting a language
course into your schedule.‘ I

.. For The Pitt News -_

When you tell your out-of—state
acquaintances you attend the’Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, you’re likely
to receive either a blank stare or a

K. H... generic compliment.

That’s not because our school
has a bad reputation — it’s because
we’re not known for anything in
particular. For better or for worse,
Pitt’s identity isn’t nearly as dis-
tinct as, say, Penn State’s or Carn-
egie Mellon’s. We are a haven for
neither party animals nor anime—l
obsessed nerds — although you’ll
encounter countless people from
both camps. As is the case at many
city schools, our student body is

r eclectic and resists standard la-

bels.

In some ways, of course, this is
ideal. Few employers will typecast
you when they see “University of
Pittsburgh” on your resume. But it
can be dispiriting when your Penn
State friends all start raving about
the same traditions —— THON, for
instance — or trading slogans
and inside jokes. Attending rural
schools often means participat-

Moving into a college dorm is argu-
ably the most exciting part of mov-

is more than just a bedroom. It’s

your new home in the vast world of

experiences that college life offers.

When you move in, you’ll have the V

opportunity to sculpt your collegiate

R, K life from a clean slate, and setting up

your dorm space is the ﬁrststep in
doing so for many college students.
But before you rush to pack up the
carand make the big move to campus,
there’s some things you should con-

while hardly ubiquitous, does help
Lmite a large number of disparate
people. But no Pitt institution 
yet fostered the feeling of intercon-
nectedness you might encounter at
Penn State or Ohio State.

What does it mean, then, to at-
tend the University of Pittsburgh?
Does our campus even have an
overarching community? After
spending four years at this school,
I can say with conﬁdence that it
does. But you won’t ﬁnd it during
your PittStart, your six-day orien-
tation or even your ﬁrst weeks of
class. Instead, our school’s sense of
solidarity emerges mainly during
crises.

Two years ago, a massive bliz-
zard — which students soon
christened “Snowpocalypse” —
engulfed the city. Forbes Avenue
became untraversable. Professors
and commuter students found

V themselves stranded miles away

from campus. Faced with the pros-
pect of injury—related lawsuits,
the University had no choice but

to cancel classes — three times. .

Needless to say, undergraduates
were elated. From my seventh-
ﬂoor McCormick Hall suite, I could
hear people erupting in cheers as
they received, Pitt’s emergency
notiﬁcation messages to their cell
phones. Many students rushed
home to grab their ‘sleds. Many
more rushed to  bars. But in
the giddy atmosphere that ensued,

everyone forgot  cliques and

petty grievances, and began be-

Textbooks: How to get them without selling a kidney, soul

Sarah Reagle
For The Pitt News

Buying and selling books can make

' for some of the most frustrating

times of the semester. During the
ﬁrst week or two, you drop hun-
dreds of dollars on mandatory
texts and course packets at the
bookstore, and then at the end of
the semester you sell them back for
a measly $20 — if you’re lucky. If
you’re extra lucky, you might even
get a light-up cup thrown in for
free.

But it doesn’t have to be like
this. You don’t have to suffer
through crazy high prices and the
ridiculously low sellback rate if you
do a little more legwork. Buying
books can be a lot less expensive
and selling them can be more lu-
crative if you put in some extra ef-
fort. Here’s some advice ‘on how to
successfully navigate the market.

Find out which books you need

This is the obvious ﬁrst step.
Most classes will have their book
lists online a few weeks before

   
  

i
,»,_ 1

classes start. The Book Center,
the main student bookstore, has
a website where you can ﬁnd book
lists for your classes, and it will
also list prices for both new and
used versions of the books. If your
class isn’t listed, you can email the
professor to ask which books you’ll
need for the upcoming semester. If
the semester’s already started, you

‘can just ﬁnd the books you need

in The Book Center, located just
outside of Litchﬁeld Towers, and
take note of the prices and whether
used copies are available. Be sure
to get the pricing from the store
so you can be sure you’re getting
a good deal later.

If you’re assigned a book that V

has multiple editions or if it’s a
novel that’s been through a lot of
reprints, ask the professor if an
earlier edition or a different ver-
sion of the novel would be accept-
able for class. Earlier editions of
books go for signiﬁcantly cheaper
prices, and sometimes you’ll al-
ready have a different copy of the
novel you need for class. You might
end up needing to buy the exact
edition for the sake of following
the pages in class, but it doesn’t

home” here at Pitt will be enjoyable.

hurt to ask.

Before deciding to buy books
online, make sure you know that
it might take a little longer to get
the books.-It might be a week or so
into the semester before you have a
book. However, this shouldn’t stop
you. Copies of books are available
in the libraries, and you can use
those in the interim. Most pro-
fessors understand the practice
of buying books online and won’t
fault you for not having your book
in class as long as you get the read-
ing done somehow.

Go online to ﬁnd cheaper prices

At this point, you should have
the list of books you need as well
as -the prices for these books, both
new and used. Armed with this
knowledge, head to the Internet.
The two most popular places to buy
and sell books online are Half.com
—— a company owned by eBay —
and Amazon Marketplace. Other
sites also exist to sell textbooks,
and I’ve used some of these myself.
However, lI ﬁnd it easier to buy
them all in one place, and both of
these sites have a wide variety. If
you want to use another site, just

.iversi   
lPolice Department  

To all the students at Pin-_:

make sure it’s reputable. p

If you’re using Amazon Mar-
ketplace and Half.com, look up
a couple of books on both sites,
and see which has generally better
pricing. If you want, you could buy
books from both, but I ﬁnd it easier
to just do one big transaction on
one site. I might have to spend a
couple more dollars this way, but
it makes my life easier.

Once you decide which is the
better site, make sure that the price
you’ll pay is worth the wait and still
a bargain once you calculate ship-
ping, which is about $4 per book.
If the book is only a few dollars
cheaper than the used price in the
bookstore, don’t waste your time
buying it online. Just buy it at the

‘bookstore, and save yourself the

hassle. If you ﬁnd that The Book
Centex;_doesn’t have a used copy of
what you want, be sure to check out
the other used bookstores, such
as Campus Bookstore on Fifth
Avenue. f

Decide the condition you’re com-

fortable with ' ’
You’ll notice that books come

in various conditions online. This

basically determines the amount

of writing in the book and general _,

wear-and-tear on the book.

If you’re looking for something
with very little or no writing, buy
“like new” or “very good.” I never
buy from the “brand new” catego-
ry, because most of the “very good”

books come from college students ‘

like us. We use them for a semester,
and that’s it. “Like new” is going
to be pretty close to brand new,
and I refuse to pay more money
for the title.

If you’re comfortable with writ-
ing — remember, that it could be
in pen —— and a bit of highlight-
ing, feel free to buy something in
“good” or “acceptable” condition.
I hate when there’s writing in my
books, so I only buy from these

categories if there’s a signiﬁcant if

price difference. If the price is low
enough for a heavily marked-up
book, I’ll buy it.

Sell your books online

At the end of the semester, stick
mainly to selling your books on-
line. This isn’t true for every single

D0n’tﬁzz'l at seeing ﬁzilure asdan integral part of college experience

Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

Let me tell you the tale of Freshman Eliza-
beth. Freshman Elizabeth thought it would
be a great idea in her first semester to
take Introduction to Psychology, a basic
lecture course that fulﬁlled a natural sci-
ence gen-ed requirement and seemed sort
of interesting. Then, a month into her ﬁrst
semester in college, Freshman Elizabeth
took her ﬁrst-ever college exam. A week
after that, Freshman Elizabeth found out
she had failed that exam.

Yes, the ﬁrst grade of my college career
was a stinging 57 percent — an F on my
Intro to Psych exam. .

And it was the best thing that could
have happened my freshman year. So here

‘ is my advice for new students: Do not be

afraid to fail. I’ll give you three good rea-
sons.

Here’s the thing about college: It’s much
more difficult than high school. It doesn’t
matter how prestigious your high school
was or how many AP classes you took; the
majority of your college classes will be
much harder than any you’ve previously
encountered. They require much more
studying and dedication. All that free time
you thought’ you would have in college?

That’s so you can work.

I didn’t realize this immediately, so I
made the common mistake of thinking I
could get away with barely studying for my
classes — like I did in high school -— based
on the idea that I was “smart.” I thought
I was getting away with it, until that first
exam. Failing that exam was the wake-up
call I needed to realize that college was a
whole different situation and thatl needed
to invest more time in my education.

Failing in the beginning of your college
career will snap you out of that inevitable
delusion that you don’t need to study much
or work very hard to get the same grades
you got in high school. Even if you think
you won’t need a wake up call, you can
never know for sure. I thought I would
avoid it, and I didn’t. —

Another benefit of failing is that it dem-
onstrates that you are trying something
new and out of your comfort zone. For
example, during my freshman year, a group
of my friends decided that they wanted
to start a prank war. My team wanted to
steal a friend’s Tom Brady bobblehead and
suspend it injell-O. Lots of Saran wrap, a
plastic jack—o’—lantern bucket and some
liquidy cherry Jell-O later, we had failed
to suspend the bobblehead. The lesson?
I’m really horrible at pranks. _

But I’d tried something new. I went out-

 Mexlcm GRILIS

side of my comfort zone to try something
with my friends, and, even though it failed,

' we had a fun time doing it“. This failure

philosophy applies with all sorts of things,
from classes to extracurricular activities.
For instance, if you always wanted to try
your hand at skiing, go on a ski trip. If
you fail, at least you know you’re not good

1 at skiing. Or maybe you think you’d be a

great hip-hop dancer — audition for one
of the crews on campus. If you fail, at least
you tried.

Sure, it sounds like a cliche, but you
can’t succeed at things you don’t try. You
will likely have the most free time-during

your freshman year, so use it to try things -

you always thought you’d be interested in.
And similar to how I-realized I’m a horrible
prankster, maybe you’ll learn something
from a failure. That will just leave the door
open to discover something else you’re
good at. 1
Most important is the ﬁnal reason for
failing: Failure forces you to face your true
character. If you want to develop and grow
as a new, independent person in college,
failures can help to test and shock your
character. Before you build a new’build-
ing, you need to knock down the old one
with a wrecking ball. Let failure be that
. wrecking ball. _
I experienced the largest wrecking ball

 

in my academic life when, as a new student
struggling with philosophy, I found that I
was a failure at reading my textbook. There
were words on the page that werejust not
translating into my brain and making any
sense. One night, I got really overwhelmed
and had a semi-mental breakdown about

' the class. After taking time to de-stress,

I learned a few valuable things about my-
self, including my susceptibility to being
overwhelmed when I don’t understand
things, the necessity of time—management
and reserving time to relax.
Understanding these aspects of my
character was essential to my growth as
a responsible, independent person and
my success in the rest of my college ca-
reer. Sometimes it takes failure to break
you down, make you take a hard look at

yourself and recognize the aspects of your a

character that need to grow or change.
Failure is an essential part of the grow-
ing process and a critical aspect of your
ﬁrst semester or two in college. Failing
can be a wake—up call, it can show you’re
trying new things, and, most importantly,
it shows you the essence of your charac-
ter. So despite what your parents or your
teachers tell you, go ahead: Fail. It’ll hurt
initially, but give it time. You’ll be better

for it in the end.

A recent graduate offers new students some advice

Mark Kozlowski
For The Pitt News

In my four years at Pitt, I ﬁgured out not only
how to get to class but also how to take advan-
tage of a lot of the offerings around the Uni-
versity. I knew how to add-drop with aplomb
back in the gentler, simpler times when that
had to be done in person. I found symphony

tickets, ball games and romance, and I had it

all ﬁgured out just in time to graduate. The
least I can do is to leave behind some advice
for the incoming class. ’ ‘

The most important thing to remember
about Pitt is that it is a big place. With more
than 30,000 students on campus, students
can easily feel a little overwhelmed. It’s vital
to remember that Pitt’s size offers both chal-
lenges and opportunities. Students can often
slip through the cracks: With so many people,
you will most likely be just a face to your profes-
sors — or if you’re lucky, a name and aface. You
are perfectly welcome tojust sit in your room
all day with the door shut, never do anything
and leave in four years an utter enigma.

Yetthis size also presents some pretty good
opportunities. There are people with literally
every interest imaginable in or around this
campus. I’ve heard bagpipes on the Cathedral
lawn, for instance. With all these interests
come a lot of groups and activities — there
are research opportunities, some excellent
lectures, cultural events, anything and every-
thing. All you have to do is ﬁnd them.

_ So the best piece of advice I can give is: get
involved. Go to the Student Activities Fair at

the end of August and see what you might be -

interested in joining. Many groups are small
and thrilled to have new members. You should
also ﬁnd out what organization functions as a
clearinghouse for whatever it is you like. I liked
going to cultural events, so I made a bee—line
for Pitt Arts. If you can ﬁnd an organization
or two to belong to, the school won’t seem so
big and overwhelming anymore. And after
you’ve met a few friends, the other thousands

' of students fade into the background. .

You should also make an effort to get to
know your professors. This isn’t especially
difficult All you need to do is talk to them after
class or during ofﬁce hours. I used to worry
that this would be construed as “sucking up,”
but it really isn’t. You don’t have to tell them
how great you think they are. Just ask a ques-
tion about the last lecture or discuss a topic
you found interesting. A lot of professors really
don’t have many students interact with them.
The vast majority of students will tramp into
class (or not), listen to the lecture and then go
home. If you talk to your professor or even just
introduce yourself, this sets you apart. Better
still, if you get involved in research or teach-
ing —— and you_should —— you’ll get to know a
few faculty members very well.

You will need to get used tothe amount of

A liberty aiforded to new college students. Use it-

wisely. Freedom means the ability to stay up as
long as you want, sleep in as long as you want

 

   

and go where you want with whomever you
want whenever you want. But it also means‘ if
you fail atest because you cut class orbecause
you didn’t study, that’s your problem. Nobody
cares. The consequences of your choices rest
squarely on you in more ways than one. You’ve
probably heard all about how a wild college
lifestyle can ruin your grades and health, but
also consider thatl saw some people who were
physically attractive when starting college and
looked much worse after the wear of four years
of hard partying. .
Whatever it is you choose to do, it is a good

      

 

idea to have a plan B. I’m directingthis speciﬁ-
cally at aspiring pre—med students, but it really
applies to everybody, in.all aspects of college.
You might not be able to take a particular class
that you planned to take. Be ready for that
eventuality. You might ﬁnd that a particular
class or a particular major is just not right for
you. You might not be as attracted to aparticu-
lar career path as you thought you’d be. That
can cause a lot of stress. Thinking ahead and
having fallback plans are two good ways to
make these four years easier.

is: relax! College is a lot of work, but it’s also a

' lot of ﬁlfl. If you spend every minute worrying "1

about what happens tomorrow, you’re not go-
ing to enjoy today. Provided that you stay on
top of things, ﬁnd a good source of advice and
think ahead, I ﬁnd that things tend to turn out
for the best. Trust me, I don’t even remember
what I worried about freshman year, as most *7’
of that stuff turned out to not really matter.
If you keep your cool, I think the story will
be the same for you. Welcome to Pitt — you’re
going to love it.

tions draw from my experience on Half.com.

After making an account, the rest is
simple. You enter the ISBN number of your
books on a form, and it ﬁnds all the listings
for you.

The next step is to set your asking price.
Unless it’s ridiculously low, I always set my
prices a few pennies lower than the low-
est price currently offered in my condition

range. If the lowest price for the same “like.

new” book is $13.94, I’ll set mine at $13.90.
Even if you paid $20 for the book, it’s better
to sell quickly and lose a few dollars overall
than to keep the price high and wait forever
for someone to by it. Consider the loss a
renter’s fee for using the book for a semester.

A The ﬁnal step is to choose the appropriate
condition and make notes for‘ the exact dam-
age incurred. I like to be as honest as possible
— “bent right corner of cover, highlighting
in ﬁrst chapter only” —— in order to assure

that my buyers know what they’re getting. «

In order to retain a good rating as a seller,
you need to be honest about condition. If you
hardly used a text, list it as “like new.” But
if you dropped it in a puddle at some point,
list it appropriately. If your buyers know that
they are getting a mediocre copy up front,
they won’t hate you when it arrives. Retain-
ing a good seller rating will allow people to
trust you online and continue to buy your
books in the future. “

It is also essential to ship your books as
soon as possible once someone buys them. I
once waited four weeks after classes started
for a book to arrive, and it put me behind on
my work. I left some nasty feedback for that
seller, and people will do the same to you if
you don’t ship your books in a timely fashion.
Stay on top of your books for sale, and make
sure you know when they sell.

When you put in the time to buy and sell
books online, you can literally save hundreds
of dollars. Just work it into your routine,
and you’ll be happy when you have a little
extra cash ﬂoating around. There’s noth-
ing better than paying $75 for eight books
when you know you would’ve spent $200 in
the bookstore. Your parents will probably
thank you, too. I ‘

Fitting travel time into a tight class sched-

ule is rough enough at a university without 1

security checkpoints. If _Pitt, in the name of
safety, were to stock building entrances with
guards who checked bags and IDs but not

pockets, hats or musical instrument cases I

(like last semester), students should not
passup any chance they get to speed their
way through the “security” line. _
4. Make friends and/to try your luck.
College students_ have many incentives
to pursue new friendships. Traditionally,
people made friends oncampus to share
common experiences, like midterm cram
sessions and 2‘ a.m. bar crawls. Now you’ve
got all that plus the chance that your new
friend is somehow involved in the bomb

sracmac MY Nscac our
Expect drastic change in relations

Tracey Hickey

I Columnist

Let’s be real: Although a lot of kids
really miss their parents when they
go away to college, a lot of kids
really, really don’t. That many stu-

dents actually. consider “getting

away from my family” a primary
draw of college life is perhaps the

‘worst-kept secret of freshman
‘year.

I That said, moving across the
state, or however far you moved
when you came to Pitt —— maybe
not that far at all — is not a miracle

cure for parental drama. In fact,
I ‘probably the most useful thing I
“can do is remind you that after

you leave the house, you still have
parents. They’re still there. They’re
still your parents. And I’m here to
tell you that keeping this in mind

I is a worthwhile part of setting out

on your own.
Take me, for example. Blogger

‘ Holly Pervocracy once said that 98
-percent of her relationship with

her mother “was good and loving
and selﬂess and, if anything, too
generous. The other 2 percent was

pretty ugly.” Although Holly’s’s re-

lationship with her mother was
much more tumultuous than my
relationship with my parents ever
was, that sentiment spoke to me.
It’s not that I don’t love my parents
to pieces — I do, and they love me
back. But while love is more than
enough to prevent you from physi-
cally killing your family, it is, in my
experience, not enough to make a
household peaceful. For my father
and I —— both intensely opinion-
ated, occasionally short-fused peo-
ple who are so far across the po-
litical spectrum from one another
that we have to pay long-distance
fees to talk about the election — all
the love in the world isn’t always
enough to stop us from getting
into shouting matches when the
news IS on.

‘Whatever your situation, you’re
not the only one. Some new stu-
dents are coming from truly de-
plorable family situations, rife
with abuse, substance addiction,
constant ﬁghting or a number of
other factors that can create a real-

ly_ unhealthy scene. Sometimes, the '

student and parents in question
have simply exhausted the number
of years they can live continuously

under one roof together without _

going bonkers. Needless to say, af-
ter a few solid years of the opinion-
fueled tension in my house, fleeing
to Pittsburgh and not spending any
signiﬁcant amount of time in Dad’s
car when Rush Limbaugh was on
was a huge relief. The truth is that a
lot of students, whether the source
of their parental conﬂicts comes
from politics or other personal

‘disagreements, experience relief _
when they get to college. But it’s

worthwhile to remember that in
most cases, your family loves you
and misses you and wants to know
how you’re doing.

Sofor the love of God, answer -

your parents’ phone calls. I’m not
just saying this for their sakes; I’m
saying it for yours. My freshman
year, I put of returning my par-
ents’ calls for a variety of reasons:
I was busy; I was hiding bad news
about my grades; my father had
learned over Easter break that I
was pro-choice and was vocally
concerned about my chances of
salvation.

Whatever the reason, put-
ting off answering and returning
calls from home, like putting off

just about anything, was akin to
shooting myself in the foot. After
10 days, my mother thought I was
dead and started repeatedly calling
my roommate. By the time I did get
back to them, they were livid —
and they had every right to be, as I
was being rude and inconsiderate.
Nowadays, it’s much easier to
remember to call my parents back
because — not having a meal plan
or decent paid employment —— if
1 dodge all of my parents’ phone
calls, I’ll starve. Which brings me
to my next point: money. Some stu-
dents are self-sufficient, but most
receive at least some help from
their parents in getting through
school, whether the help comes in
the form of tuition contributions,
room and board, assistance with
rent or spending money. L
Helping you out with school or
rent doesn’t entitle your parents to
treat you like crap; if you’re in an

hone§t—to-God abusive situation, _

it’s likely your parents point out
the incredible sacriﬁces they’re
making for you an awful lot, and
hold them over your head inappro-
priately. That isn’t cool under any
circumstances. But if your situa-

 with parents during first year

tion is more benign than that, little
displays of gratitude — remember-
ing to say “thank you”’whenever
they deposit a check in your ac-
count and generally demonstrat-
ing that you understand that your
parents are working hard to send

you to school — can go a long way

toward showing your parents that
you don’t take their sacriﬁces for
granted or see them as a paycheck.

Finally, while you don’t have to
come home every weekend that
your mother asks you to, please
remember to be considerate when

you do come home. It might be

weird to have your parents ask

. when you’ll be home when you go

out with your high school friends
during Thanksgiving break when

you’ve been pulling regular all-

nighters in Pittsburgh for nearly
three months. But this is one battle
that just doesn’t make sense to
choose to ﬁght. As my boyfriend’s
mother said in the instructional
guide she made for her sons — and
later her students in school — as
they all went off to college: “Your
parents already suspect you are out
all night doing bad things. Don’t
conﬁrm their suspicions.” l

6. Spend some time in your room. While

sound like a lot more ﬁm, spending some time
in your dorm room will build a certain level of
attachment. If you really want to have some ﬁm
in your room, grab some cheap pizzas from An-
toon’s, burn those Dining Dollars on some sodas
and snacks from Quick Zone and throwaparty
in your room. You’ll be surprised how many
people want to hang out with you when you
say you’re going to go buy pizza. So invite your
ﬂoormates over to share: make new friends,
listen to new music, play new video games —
you‘ can experience a world of things without

Alarge part of every student’s college experi-

schoolwork. Life on campus is a whole new
experience, and you should make the most of

your new collegiate life, and it will give you a
solid base to startfrom whenyou begin explor-
ing the many facets of life at Pitt.

   Oakland music scene on the upswing after years of stagnation

Jeff Ihaza
Staff I/Vriter

This past spring, local bands and South
Oakland residents convened for a night of
live music. Combining its vintage and modern
appeals, The Hideout hosted South Oakland
Fest, an evening of live performances by four
local bands made up of Pitt students, alumni
and friends.

Now is a fortunate time to be a live music
fan at Pitt. Though the neighborhood of Oak-
land and the entire Pittsburgh community
have a recent history of being snubbed by
popular acts, the past few years have shown
the beginning of a major turnaround in the

‘ ‘area.

In past decades, Oaklandlattracted many
popular bands to its various bars and music
venues. But as the neighborhood changed
over the years, so did its musical appeal,
and soon, the big names began passing over
Oakland.

Music venues suchas Club Laga, Decade
and the Electric Banana ﬂourished in Oakland
in years past. These locations hosted frequent
live performances, and since they were lo-
cated in Oakland, students could enjoy the

music in its natural form, rather than through
a set of boom box speakers.

Club Laga, which was previously located
in the present-day location of IGA and its
upstairs apartment complex, hosted many
bands and artists. .

“Imagine [the IGA supermarket] as a
75o—capacity club with dancing and live music
every night,” Manny Theiner said. Theiner has
been a key player in the resurrection of the
Oakland music scene and was the organizer
of this spring’s South Oakland Fest.

After its peak in the ’80s and ’9os, the ‘

music scene in Oakland began to decline.
The once—lively clubs shut down, and music
stores began to close. Any form of music scene
disintegrated in the area, and local shows
dwindled.

Today, however, Oakland’s music scene
is making a comeback. With the success of
South Oakland Fest and the growing popu-
larity of a few local acts, the music scene is
being reinvented. _

According to The Hideout’s manager, Rick
Schoﬁeld, the inaugural South Oakland Fest
nearly ﬁlled the venue to capacity, and was a
welcome change from the seemingly endless
drought of live music in the neighborhood.

South Oakland Fest is one _example of

“There really hasn’t been a whole lot in
the Oakland area until recently. Most of the
time, I would go to the Shadow Lounge in
East Liberty to see live bands,” Pitt senior
Paul Schillinger said.

But just in the past year, bands such as No

— William Pitt Union a full—fledged venue be-
cause of WPTS-FM, Pitt’s student—run radio
station.

The Hideout also has emerged as a re-
spectable concert venue. Originally a bar lo-
cated deep in South Oakland, The Hideout
— with the help of The Original Magazine,

‘ which presented South Oakland Fest 4- is be-
coming a focal point for live music in Oakland.

The name of the venue speaks volumes

. about its location. Nestled at the bottom of
Bates Street, The Hideout looks and feels like
its name suggest. Unlike the multitude of bars
in Oakland, The Hideout offers a1l—ages shows
for the under—21 crowd, making it ‘a good
option for younger students still looking to

' enjoy live music.

The stuffy winter months might not

pecially if schoolworkleftyouwithout
alot of time to exercise. In college, the
same time constraints will still exist,
but there is still time to get in shape
—— and the dreadful treadmill does not
have to be the answer. l

such as yoga, pilates and Zumba are '

giving students anewway to get out of
the weight room and off the treadmill

Getcredit

Studenw can take courses at Pittto
chip away at credits required for grad-
uation, or they can venture outside
of Oakland to ﬁnd something more
aligned with their interests.

At the University, students can
take these forms of exercise as courses
through the Health and Fitness Pro-
gram. This program offersyoga, pilates
and Zumba, along with other, more
traditional exercise courses. ‘

This summer, work will begin
on a brand new Health and Fitness
Program facility According to Renee
Rogers, acoordinatorfortheprogram,
“approximately 5,000 square feet of
cardiovascular and resistance equip-
ment along with two new group exer-
cise studios” will be added to the new
facility at Trees Hall. This will give the
program the opportunity to provide

T moreclassesandopﬁonsforstudents

and Staff.

Students cantakeﬁtness classesfor
one credit. For non—students, courses
range in cost from $45-$60.

Many students on Pitt’s campus
carryyoga and pilates mats to and from
their classes. These trendy workout
routines — which health profession-
als have commended as great exercise

  

regimens — promise a strong core,
a long, toned physique and a sound
mind. Yoga and pilates are two exer-
cises that many have heard of or at-
tempted.

' “Our yoga courses allow staff and
students who are working and study-
ing all day to have time for relaxation,”
Rogers said.

People can take yoga and pilates
together in a single course or sepa-
rately. The pilates course focuses less
on relaxation and more on strength
and ﬂexibility.

“The pilates course is more diffi-
cult, so alot of people like it combined
with the yoga if they are looking for
relaxation and strengthening,” Rog-
ers said.

Breathe in

Yoga gives students many added
beneﬁts besides the obvious workout.
Laura Greenﬁeld, a Pit senior, has
served as the Yoga Club president for
the pasttwoyears.As anursing major,
Greenﬁeld found yoga to be a form of
relaxation because of its meditative

_ context.

“Afterthe ﬁrst class, I realized how
great it was and how calm I felt,” she
said.

Greenﬁeld has done yoga for six

years and says she has beneﬁted great-

off the treadmill

lyfromthe exercises. When shebegan,
she could nottouch hertoes. Now, her
hands touch the ground.

“You gain muscle all over your
body. I played soccer and basketball ,

_ and tennis, but yoga made me feel the

best and the strongest,” she said.

If students live off campus or just
have the urge to escape Oakland, there
are many yoga and pilates studios to
choose from. In Shadyside, students
can go to AmazingYoga andYoga Flow.
Both studios offer aform of yoga called
power vinyasa ﬂow.

Powervinyasaﬂowyoga is aform of
hot yoga. The heat is turned up in this
class to about 85 degrees. Vinyasa is a
term in yoga that refers to the breath-
synchronized movementthat partici-
pants use throughoutthe practice. This
means thatwith every yoga pose, there
is an inhale and an exhale that incor-
porates the movements to form the
“flow” part of the exercise.

Power vinyasa ﬂow will leave
you feeling refreshed and sweaty.
Throughout a power yoga, the body
eliminates toxins inthe body through
sweat. Other beneﬁts of yoga include
increased ﬂexibility, a stronger core

A quality night out in Pittsburgh can be
expensive — dinner at a nice restaurant
followed by a live performance is some-
thing that not many college students can
afford in their weekly budgets.

But what if it was all for free?

Pitt Arts is a University program
that helps students experience and ex-
plore Pittsburgh’s local arts community.
Through the organization, students have
the opportunity to attend performances,
exhibitions and concerts that often fea-
ture additional discussions or meet-and-
greets accompanied by a meal or dessert.

The program sends emails to its mem-
bers about discounted tickets and local
arts events that students can go to for
free through the program. With a Pitt
ID, whole arts experiences can be totally
without cost.

When students sign up for a Pitt Arts
event, they receive a free night of food,
art and conversation. According to Pitt
Arts Director Annabelle Clippinger, Pitt
established the program, which is funded
by the Office of the Provost, in 1997.

Clippinger said the program has ex-
panded greatly since its creation by in-
cluding new events. She said that it “is

one of Pitt’s goals is educating the whole ‘

student. This happens not only in the
classroom,'but outside of the classroom,
as in what Pitt Arts offers,” she said.

With more than 110 events every year, -

Pitt Arts’ main goal is to expose students
to the fine arts, which it believes helps
make students more globally aware.

Pitt Arts also gives students the op-‘

portunity to visit local museums for
free. During the regular academic year,
students receive free access to the Andy
Warhol Museum, Phipps Conservatory
and Botanical Gardens, the Carnegie Mu-
seum of Art and the Carnegie Museum of
Natural History, among others.

“The Museum Visits program is also
something that enhances students’ ex-
perience while at the University of Pitts-
burgh,” Clippinger said.

A Though some people might fear they
are not the “artsy” type and would not
enjoy the events offered through Pitt
Arts, sophomore Emily Crabb contends
otherwise.

“Not all of the shows are standard.

  Fill your wardrobe

with items true to your  

personality

Anna Weldon
A €9°E Editor

Say goodbye to high school trends in the
fall. Once on a college campus, things
change drastically in the fashion circuit,
and new students will ﬁnd that past trends
are less important to their current aca-
demic environment. ‘
Certain high school stereotypes extend
to the extremes, but in college, they are
drastically less prevalent. Students who
once found all of their friends wearing po-

los, sporting spiked hair or only dressing V

in sweatshirts will find a huge difference
on a college campus.

During high school, it’s very easy to
get wrapped up in a certain persona. But
college is the place to abandon the stereo-
types, and come into a real personality
that is more originaland innate. Your
fashion choices _can often play a role in
that transformation.

Consider leaving

the loud, ’
drastic pieces
at home...»
  Simplicity is the
easiest option.

On campus, there are fewer distinc-
tions between students. Cliques and
groups are less prevalent, creating a more
equal social atmosphere. Students tend to
wear similar clothing without too many
extreme pieces that were popularin high

Andi Saptono gets his lunch from
a food cart at least once a week.
As a long-time patron of the Pad
Thai Express food cart, he knows
that his favorite entrees — fried
ﬁsh and satay chicken — don’t
appear on the menu every day.
“It’s a secret menu that
doesn’t pop up every day, so
when it does you better get it.
It’s awesome,” said Saptono, a
post-doctoral student in Pitt’s
School of Health and Rehabilita-
tion Science. ‘ ~ '
Saptono is one of many regu-
. lar customers of the food carts
stationed on Bigelow Boulevard,

across the street from the Sol.— -

diers & Sailors Memorial Hall.
These three operational food
carts have histories at Pitt and
loyal groups of patrons who can
attest to the taste of the fresh
food cooked on-site inside the

. carts. The carts, which are open ‘

Monday through Friday, have
gained a strong reputation as a

frugal alternative to on—campus ,

dining. Customers can enjoy a
full entree from any of the food

Summer-2012 | The Pitt News i \A/\/wv.pittnevvs.c0m

I Students ﬁnd inexpensive meals at Bigelow Boulevard food carts

carts for less than $6.

The carts are open year-
round, but business tends to
thrive when the often-dreary
Pittsburgh weather is nice.
During the winter months, the
carts open on warmer, sunnier
days and stay open as long as
they have‘ business. They typi-
cally don’t open if the forecast
is bleak. Each of the three food

carts varies in hours of opera-.

tion but is generally open a little
before, during and a few hours
after lunchtime.

Though centrally located,

the carts remain a well-kept se-'

cret from many freshmen and
new students, said Rita Amin,
the owner of India on Wheels,
another food cart on Bigelow
Boulevard.

“Many new students don’t
know we’re here,” Amin said.

“They don’t have class on this"

side of campus, so they never
see us.”

Kashmiri, a third food cart -
also known as Chakh Le India

.—- sits between India on Wheels

and Pad Thai Express.
India on Wheels and Kashmiri
have similar menus, featuring

many curry dishes and other
traditional Indian specialties.
Both Amin and Patidar Vinay, the
owner of Kashmiri, list chicken
tikka masala as their most popu-
lar entree. The chicken in a tradi-
tional chicken tikka is marinated,
roasted and curried. Vinay noted
his ginger garlic chicken curry as
the other most popular entree at
Kashmiri.

Both Indian carts have veg-
etarian options, as well. At India
On Wheels, vegetarians tend to
gravitate toward the matar pan-

’ eer, a dish featuring cheese cubes
andpeas cooked in a creamy ~

sauce.
Despite Saptono’s passion for
Pad Thai Express’ fried ﬁsh and

‘ chicken satay, owner Tim Vong

do'es not think those are his most
popular items. He claims that his
teriyaki chicken, pad thai, spicy
pork and various curry dishes
are the most highly sought after.
His menu usually features two
specialty items every day in ad-
dition to his 10 standard items.

Vong said his job is enjoyable
because of his friendly patrons.

“I really enjoy working here,”

Summer 2012 I The Pitt News 1 vvWvv.pittnevvs.cem

Build cl collection of essential movies to ensure college preporeclness  

Sarah Simkin
F or The Pitt News

There are certain times that call for a movie.
Whether it be with friends or alone, a movie
night always serves as a classic entertain-
ment option. With a bag of popcorn made
in a new microwave, it’s a great choice for
a night inside a dorm room.

A good collection of movies is one thing
that every student needs. From thrillers to
romantic comedies, several critical ﬁlms
are necessary for building a successful en-
tertainment arsenal.

Disney ﬁlms

The large collection of Disney ﬁlms that
served as cinematic staples during many

people’s childhoods can nowlmove into the V

collegiate sphere. Whether you’re sick or
bored with a roommate, you may ﬁnd that
nostalgia tops novelty.

These movies are not composed only of

princesses and chick-flick storylines. Many *

of the ﬁlms from the ’9os such as “The Lion
King” and “Toy Story” are gender-neutral
as far as enjoyment is concerned, and they
have relatable plots. But that isn’t to say that
you should avoid classic Disney princess
stories. Movies such as “The Little Mer-
maid” and “Mulan” offer a feminine appeal
instinctual to Disney classics.

Regardless of your taste, Disney movies
are classic ﬁlms that lend a comfort-of-
home feel to a new place and can be a good
option for bonding with new friends over

childhood favorites. .

One truly obscure cult ﬁlm

When everyone boasts about their exten-
sive cinematic experience, you can prove to
them that they have not seen everything.
Less popular ﬁlms will grant your friends
the chance to watch something new that
does not ﬁt the mold many college students
expect. _

Movies such as “Die You Zombie Bas-
tards!” and “The Man Who Fell to Earth”
are two obscure ﬁlms that many people

have likely not seen. While they might not xv
appeal to every viewer, at least they’ll prove '

that options other than the ‘run-of—the-mill
cult classics exist.

Date-night ﬁlm

Date-night ﬁlms constitute a tricky‘

category. This movie needs to be exciting
enoughto engage your date butstill boring

r.-' u.
-enough;-,to induce some advances.

It’s,_lp_ng been known that movies such
as “Gladiator” have action—ﬁlled plots that
are great for ﬁrst dates but conveniently lull
in the middle, "leaving room for ﬂirtatious

conversation.

Avoid sad, overly violent and unhumor—
ous movies, since these will leave a date
completely uninterested during the entire
evening.

Pop-culture necessities

Movies considered pivotal to the college-
aged generation and modern pop-culture
trends vary from person to person. But
certain ﬁlms such as “Rocky Horror Picture
Show,” “Fight Club” and “Mean Girls” are
too important to miss.

There is always at least one person who
has yet to see these staple ﬁlms. Though it

might seem shocking that they could be.

missed, with these movie options, you can

helplmake that person feel included in the
- pop-culture knowledge.

I The movie that makes you laugh every

time,’ no matter how often you re-watch it

This is an easy pick-me-up for days
that aren’t going very well. Movies such as
“Tropic Thunder,” “The Hangover” and
“(50_0) Days of Summer” are mood—light-
ening movies to watch when the stress of
college starts to pile on.

They have a humor that is easy to enjoy
andwill get you laughing even if you just
failed an exam. A

The movie you want to show to everyone
you meet

This is the movie that you will inces-
santly quote or reference any chance you
get. Upon arrival at college, this movie will
be something to- share with friends who
are still new and want to learn a little more
about you. A

This movie is not just one with which

you are obsessed and of which you know”

all the lines by heart — it also speaks to
who you are. "

I’m an evangelical Wes Anderson fan and
feel that most people would live more en-

riched lives if they saw the movie “The Royal A

Tenenbaums.” This movie is an important

part of my personal movie collection.
Tread lightly with this movie, and try

not to impose viewings upon the unwilling.

National Lampoon’s “Animal House”

“Animal House” is often imitated, but
never topped. It sets a standard that all
other university-themed movies try to ex-
ceed. This movie comedically exaggerates
the craziness of the college experience,
and although other ﬁlms have attempted
to reinvent this standard, the original is
still the best example of this type
of movie. g T V '3.

lFreshmen face a lot of stressors — from
moving away from home to making new
friends —‘ and without the comfort of a

V home-cooked meal, these difficulties can

seem even more overwhelming.

, But food shouldn’t-be a concern for in-
coming students. Pitt offers dining facili-
ties that provide a vast range of choices.
There are both cafeteria-style dining and
on—the—go options that help to fit’ each
student’s busy schedule. And fortunately,
Pitt accommodates food allergies, dietary
restrictions and most other special re-
quirements students might have.

Meal Plans

Students must choose a meal plan be-
fore they begin to chow down at any of
Pitt’s on-campus dining options.

All Pitt students that live in on-campus
dormitories are required to purchase a
meal plan, which include one of two op-
tions — Ultimate Access or Dining Pass
Tiers. Students can switch meal plans by

going to Panther Central during the ﬁrst '

two weeks of any semester to find the plan

' that best ﬁts their habits.

l

“We encourage
students to talk
S to us. We’re

here ‘to, feed

 Meal plans consist of two types of cur-

, rency: meal passes and Dining Dollars. ’

Though students can also use Dining
Dollars at these locations, there are other
spots where meal passes are not accepted
and Dining Dollars are the currency of
choice. Students have the option of pur-
chasing food and beverages with Dining
Dollars at coffee carts, campus conve-
nience stores and cafeteria-style eateries.

However, Dining Dollars should not
be confused with Panther Funds, which
students can also spend at off-campus

restaurants and businesses that accept
them. Panthers Funds should be treated
as regular currency placed on the Pitt ID.

Incoming students can choose a meal
plan from one of four different tiers, in-
cluding the Ultimate Access tier, which
ﬁttingly provides students with unlim-
ited swipes into Market Central or the The
Perch for an entire semester. All tiers come
with a combination of meal passes and
Dining Dollars.

69

For those less likely to dine frequently
at the cafeterias, there are three other tiers
which provide multiple combinations of
Dining Dollars and meal passes. Students
choosing a meal plan should keep in mind
that their Dining Dollars and meal swipes
do not carry over from one semester to
the next.

Recent graduate Mouna Coulibaly wanted to
take-a web design class in a more construc-
tive atmosphere than the computer science
department at Pitt, so she decided to take
the course through Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

“Intro to Web Design was a very cool
class, and it’s a good skill to have,” said
Coulibaly, a communications and French
major. “Pitt only offers courses through the
computer science department, so it was less
intimidating to take it at Filmmakersﬂ’

Students knowledge from hip-hop and vampire courses

Anna Weldon
A€9’E Editor

When professor Robert Carl Metil in-
structs the course Vampire: Blood and
Empire, he doesn’t limit the discussion
to Dracula and Edward Cullen.

“I have ﬁelded questions on subjects
as diverse as the existence of child and.
animal vampires and the nature of the
universe and the afterlife,” he said.
fit Vampire: Blood and Empire is just
’one of a variety of classes that Pitt of-
fers that exceeds the expectations of
‘academia. Less—than-traditional courses
such as Madness and Madmen in Rus-
:sian Culture, Indo—European Folktales
‘and Bible as Literature inhabit many
‘departments and can help students gain
fzredits while opening doors to different
‘ﬁelds and interests. L
A Take a look at some of these nontra-
ditional classes as examples of what you
tan ﬁnd in Pitt’s course catalog.

i
 Vampire: Blood and Empire

at Metil taught his vampire course,
{which was offered through the Depart-
‘ment of Slavic Languages and Litera-
tures, in the 2011-2012 academic year.
 a child, he was often exposed to
traditional Slavic cultures, and he trav-

 

eled throughout Eastern Europe. These
travels contribute to his knowledge on
the subject. _

He incorporates vampirism into the
discussion of different social issues such
as the breakdown of the nuclear family,
the spread of communicable diseases
and the fear of migration. He also ap-
plies it to various emotions that society
tends to suppress and the ways in which
individuals deal with grief.

“While keeping much of the previous
content, due to my upbringing and eth-
nographic experience, I have introduced
new information on Slavic folkloric and

‘historical vampirism as well as contem-

porary ethnographic case studies from
the perspective of believers in the con-
cept of the unclean dead,” Metil said.

These weighty topics directly relate
to vampirism, and though some students
may ﬁnd the material daunting, vampir-
ismhas received a fair amount of atten-
tion in past years.

Nontraditional Languages

The Less— Commonly-Taught Lan-
guages Center gives students the chance
to learn languages that are outside
the range of traditional Romantic and
Germanic language courses typically
offered at universities. Claude Mauk, the

director of the L_CTL center, explained
that the program’s main goal is to cater
to students’ desires.

“We try to look at students’ interests,
what languages students want to take,”
he said. “We try to achieve a greater
level of diversity with these different
languages.”

After 9/11, there was an increase in
the number of students who wanted to
study Arabic. Before 9/11, the LCTL cen-
ter only offered one Modern Standard
Arabic 1 course each fall semester, but

’ because of the increased interest, Pitt

now has six sections of this course avail-
able in the fall. '

Many current and incoming students
don’t realize that Pitt offers more than
25 language courses, Mauk explained. 4
The LCTL center sponsors 12 to -14 of
them each year. In the fall semester, the
LCTL center will provide 13 different

' languages other than the department-

based languages, such as Spanish and
German.

Quechua, a language from South
America, is indigenous to the Andean
region. People continue to speak this
language in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia,’
Mauk said, although it is a minority‘
language in these countries.

The language, which predates Span,-
ish, is culturally and linguistically

o

diverse and does not ﬁt into any other
departments at the University. To con-

tinue to provide it as a course, the LCTL -..,,
center offers it to students as one of its
many languages. Quechua 1 and 3 are of-
fered in the fall semester, while Quechua
2 and 4 are offered in the spring. A

“We deﬁnitely serve as a home for
languages that couldn’t be offered
elsewhere. Even languages that are
becoming more common, for example,
American Sign Language and Arabic,”
Mauk said.

The LCTL center. received 1,076
enrollments for the 2011-2012 academic
year, reaching a large group of students
at the University.

Global Hip—Hop

Another atypical course, Global Hip-
Hop is taught through the Department
of Music by professor Adriana Helbig.
Global Hip Hop focuses on the vari-
ous societal roles of hip-hop across the
globe. The course will be offered for its
third term in the upcoming fall semester.

Helbig began her research on the sub-
ject in 2005, after she viewed a picture
of an African hip-hop artist perform-
ing in traditional Ukrainian clothing.

Pizza and books eomoine to create oz delicious eoltteeztioi/z 

Anna Weldon
A €9°E Editor

Senior Alex Zimmerman, who has been par-
ticipating in an Honors College reading group
since he was a freshman, said only one thing

« kept him ‘coming back every year.

“It’s the pizza,” he joked.

The University Honors College hosts and
ﬁmds a variety of reading groups each se-
mester open to all Pitt students. Pizza and

- Plays and Pizza and Prose are just two of the

i -(57);:

NC‘

I.‘-?.~'-,

reading groups offered to students, combin-
ing food with reading in a discussion-based
environment.‘

Mike Giazzoni, the director of student
assistantships at the Honors College, runs
Pizza and Plays, which meets once a week
during the academic year.

“I got involved because it seemed like a
good way to get involved in the Honors Col-
lege community,” Zimmerman said. '

As a political science and philosophy ma-
jor, Zimmerman likes that a variety of stu-
dents’ participate in Pizza and Plays. Rather
than a select group of theater and English
literature majors, Pizza and Plays encourages
students from all disciplines to join the group.

Giazzoni, who founded Pizza and Plays in
the spring of 2003 and is its current faculty
adviser, said he sought to create an open

spacefor students from all different majors.
“We attempt to get people in the group '

from across the disciplines. So, the last thing
I wanted was all literature and theater majors
sitting around and discussing in highfalutin
literary criticism language,” he said.
Giazzoni, who has a background in Eng-
lish literature, believes that plays are a nice
length for discussion and inspire students
to expand their imaginations in the short

Prose, which started in 2001. After beginning
his job at the Honors College, he wanted to
get more involved with the students.

“We try to read the real stuff that would
be of appeal to the students across the dis-
ciplines,” he said. “That’s the hallmark of
Pizza and Prose.” .

‘Zimmerman thinks the reading groups’
are critical in creating genuine, interdiscia‘

have fruitful conversations with students

DINING

Dining Facilities

Once students are equipped with their
new meal plans, they and their empty
stomachs can then look to the various
dining locations across campus. There is
an array of eateries for students to choose
from, and each has its own unique char-
acteristics;

Located on the lower floor of Litchﬁeld
Towers, Market Central and Market To-
Go serve similar food. At Market Central,
there is a designated space for dining,
while Market—To-Go provides quick grab-
and-go meals for students, ‘but there are
only a limited number of options each day.

The Perch, located on-upper campus
in Sutherland Hall, has the same set—up
as Market Central.

In addition to the a11—you—can-eat caf-
eterias, Pitt has many smaller eateries,
stands and stores where students can
spend money from their meal plans.

‘ In Towers and Sutherland, there are
convenience stores called Quick Zone.
Here, students can spend their Dining
Dollars to stock mini fridges with items
such as fresh fruit, frozen dinners and
other food items that don’t require much
preparation. I .

The lower level of the William Pitt
Union, the ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral
of Learning and the Petersen Events Center
all contain cafeteria—style dining options.
In these locations, students have entirely
different menus to choose from, but only
Dining Dollars can be used to purchase
food. ‘ ’

Coffee carts and retail eateries that ac-
cept Dining Dollars are scattered across
campus. These include Einstein Bros.
Bagels and Taco Bell. The hours of these
locations vary, and many are closed on
weekends.

 Sophomore Samantha Levinson has
had ample time to explore her meal plan.

“In terms of Dining Dollar establish-
ments, I eat mostly at the Cathedral Cafe ——
sushi and soup mostly, because the latter
 cheap. And the Pete, speciﬁcally Pasta

Plus and the salad bar, on the slim chance A

it’s actually open. In terms of swipes, The
Perch is actually pretty good,” she said.

Dietary Restrictions

Although students can ﬁnd food to suit
a variety of tastes at on-campus eateries,
some students might ﬁnd their culinary
options limited in another way: by dietary
restrictions or medical recommendations.
3 Luckily, Pitt’s Student Health Services
also include access to nutritionist Meg
Mayer-Costa, who works with students
to coordinate diets that ﬁt speciﬁc needs
and lifestyles. Chefs at both Market Central
and The Perch will accommodate students
with food allergies by preparing special
meals for them in order to prevent cross-
contamination with potential allergens.

Susan Fukushima, the resident district
manager for Sodexo, encourages students
to speak up about their dietary restric-
tions.

“Many students don’t speak up, and
they suffer in silence. It breaks my heart
to know that they haven’t been eating,”
Fukushima said. “We’re in the hospitality
business. We encourage students to talk
to ‘us. We’re here to feed people and make
them happy.” .

Chefs are willing to accommodate stu-
dents who have dietary restrictions. A
chef in Market Central prepares meals for
students with special dietary needs, even
making items from scratch when necessary
in the effort to ensure that ingredients

won’t make students sick.

Dining Services focuses on a variety
of restricted food areas for students. Stu-
dents with celiac disease, diabetes, hy-
poglycemia and other food allergies can
receive special services. Also, students
who follow vegetarian, vegan, kosher or
halal diets can also request specially pre-
pared foods.

Though the dining services will accom-
modate students, a doctor’s note and a list
of foods the student cannot eat are neces-
sary. Students must provide this informa-
tion in order to receive their services.

If students ﬁnd that their allergies will
not be well accommodated by these ser-
vices, they can choose to be refunded for

their plan but will be charged a fee of $150.

Additionally, if a student is sick, meals
can be brought to his or her room. To set
up this service, the students will need to
have their resident assistant contact Din-
ing Services, as Sodexo does not have ac-
cess to residence halls.

V “Our biggest concern is food safety. We
don’t want to provide students with any-
thing that would make them feel worse. We
also take into account food safety and re-
frigeration accommodations. We try to get
meals to them so that they’ll be consumed
as soon as possible,” Fukushima said.

Any questions or concerns can be ad-
dressed by Executive Chefs Keith Bauman
or Matt Mantini at 412-648-1220. j

since its inception. Former Pitt students
and faculty have become bestselling au-
thors, movie stars, professional athletes
and more, spreading Pitt’s reputation.

Here is a list of a few alumni and past
faculty who excelled both at Pitt and in
their later careers.

Michael Chabon

Michael Chabon studied English as
an undergraduate at Pitt. He graduated
in 1984 and received his MFA from the
University of California at Irvine three

‘ years later. 5
Chabon’s debutnovel, “The Mysteries

in Pittsburgh, propelled his career after it
was published in 1988. He then wrote “The
Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,”
which was published in 2000.. This novel
won Chabon a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in
2001 and now acts as his claim to fame.

Orleans Saints. In 1988 he was inducted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Gene Kelly

Born in Pittsburgh on Aug. 23, .1912,
Gene Kelly became well known for act-
ing in movies, such as the 1952 comedic
musical “Singin’ in the Rain.” But};-before
Kelly hit the big screen, he wanted to be a
baseball player for the Pittsburgh Pirates
—‘a dream he never. fulﬁlled.

In 1931, Kelly enrolled at Pitt to study
economics.» One year later, he opened the
Gene Kelly Studio of the Dance, where he
taught part time so he could continue his
education at Pitt. He graduated in 1933.

' Kelly wanted to study law at Pitt, but he
was unable to because of the Great Depres-
sion. He taught dance until he received
his first job onvBroadway in 1938, which
helped him start a long career in show
business. He passed away in 1996 at the
age of 83.

Jonas Salk was not a Pitt undergradu-

ate,'but heidid work at the University of

Rebecca Skloot

Before 2010, Rebecca Skloot was not
the well-known author she is now. She
worked as a journalist and a professor
of creative writing and science journal-
ism at various universities, including Pitt,
where she received her MFA increative

John Woodruff

In 1936,]ohn Woodruff, a Pitt freshman
and track and ﬁeld star, had a lot more to
focus on than his exams. He was competing
in the Berlin Olympics. ' _

During the 800—meter ﬁnal, other run-
ners boxed Woodruff in and forced him
to stop in his tracks. After halting in the
middle of the race, he caught up with and

. passed all the other runners, making him

the first African—American gold medalist
of the games which was a slap in the face
for Adolf Hitler.

Before he ran to Olympic victory, Wood-
ruff began his education at Pitt in 1935.
The University offered him an athletic
scholarship to complete his studies. He
graduated in 1939 with a degree in sociol-
ogy, and continued his education at New
York University to earn a master’s degree.

Woodruff passed away on October 30,
2007,‘ at the age of 92, but he continues
to serve as an important ﬁgure in the Pitt
community. Last year, Pitt unveiled a new

COURSES

The artist, who was an immigrant from
Africa, altered the traditional dress in
order to ﬁt the role of a hip—hop artist
and posed in a stereotypical hip—hop
stance. The unusual image caused Helbig
to form a long—term interest in global
perceptions of hip—hop, which later led
to the creation of her course at Pitt.

The course looks at a broad geo—
graphic span, including countries such
as Japan, South Africa and Brazil, among
others. It investigates the media’s por-

trayal of these different countries’ forms -

of hip—hop and compares the various
movements. .

“It’s a great topic, but you could kill
the class,” Helbig said. “You need to base
it on what the students are interested
in.” '

Helbig explained that the course
connects a broad range of subjects such
as economics, gender roles and politics.
Though the course may have a different
focus than traditional classes, it still
relates to broader themes that students
often expect to see.

Physics and Society

For students looking to fulﬁll a
natural sciencerequirement, profes-
sor Edward Gerjuoy offers Physics and
H Society, a course that examines the need

for public policy makers to better under-

stand science.

“There are courses which are de-
signed for undergraduates who aren’t
science majors, but we’d like for them
to have an understanding in science,” 
Gerjuoy said. “This is one such course.

We feel that students should have an
understanding of science in general, and
physics in particular.”

The course looks at physics as a sub-

ject and reveals the ways in which it ap—‘£,

plies to subjects other than the sciences.
Gerjuoy stressed that certain concepts
in physics apply to other areas, such as
public policy—making, and those who are
decision makers should know how to
obtain a certain amount of information
before creating public policy.

“I don’t expect that somebody making
decisions would know all types of sci-
ence and details. But they should know
what kind of people will give them good
science advice,” he said.

Gerjuoy hopes the course will offer 3,‘
students an understanding of what
serves as credible scientiﬁc research.

These courses may not be every
student’s ﬁrst choices, but they certainly
offer alternatives to more conventional
classes. And for professor Metil, he
believes that students respond to this
authenticity.

“Students ﬁnd it appealing because
it directly stimulates both their active
imaginations and their unconscious
minds,” Metil said. % ~

came as a result of some advice she received

1 from a gallery owner the magazine worked

with.

“I know Nina, the owner of Assemble Gal-
lery, and she basically told us, ‘Just ﬁnd what
you love and ﬁgure out how to make money
doing it,’ followed by ‘Don’t you know a lot
of bands?’” ’

A The festival began as a fundraising effort,
but soon became an opportunity to host more
live shows in a neighborhood that craved a
music scene, Capri said.

The Hideout’s manager agreed. According

to Schoﬁeld, The Hideout is more than just a '

venue in Oakland.

“For the local bands, we’re one of the larger
venues that these bands can come without
charging them too much,” Schoﬁeld said. “I’m
not looking to get rich off these bands. A lot
of times I’ll work with them to bring out the
music scene here.” _ ‘ l "

A Schoﬁeld says he sees “unlimited” po-
tential for the music coming out of Oakland.

“There are so many kids out here who, if
they just played in front of the right people,
they would blow up like that,” Schoﬁeld said.

One such band is White Like Fire, made up
of Oaklancl~based indie rockers. The group,
composed of brothers Tyler and Blake Claw-
son and Joe Killian, has been performing
around Oakland for a little more than a year.

The band was one of four featured at South
Oakland Fest. According to Clawson, the event
was a success, in part, because of the venue.

“The Hideout is great because you can
have all—ages shows,” Blake Clawson said.
“Also, it reminds me of The Strokes’ ‘Hard
to Explain’ music video.” ,

Clawson also pointed to the Pitt commu-
nity as a major reason for the success of South
Oakland Fest and music in the Oakland area.
According to Clawson, the band’s growth,
like many other bands’ in Oakland, is owed
in large part to the music scene at Pitt. .

“I think the student body at Pitt is phe-
nomenal for artistic collaboration,” Clawson
said. “I think Oakland could grow into an
interesting music scene.”

SleepyV, another local act that played
at South Oakland Fest, also believes South
Oakland is an ideal place for a music scene.
Gene Vercammen, an acoustic guitarist for
the band, believed that South Oakland Fest
would increase the number of local shows
in Oakland. , V

For Vercammen, South Oakland Fest
essentially strove “to test the waters of the
2012 South Oakland neighborhood and make
known its potential for fostering an indie
music scene,” he said. ‘ ‘

'He associated the decline of the music
scene with three key elements. T
“Lack of organization, presence of faction-
and [difﬁculty] getting the attention of the
students,” he said. V

Now, with a successful start through South
Oakland Fest, bands such as White Like Fire,
SleepyV and many more have more of an op-
portunity to perform at local venues and re-
develop the music scene in Oakland. I

The Shadyside studios show that there is
something enticing aboutvinyasa flow. Amazing
Yoga was even voted the best yoga studio in the
Pittsburgh City Paper and The Best of the Burgh
in the Pittsburgh Magazine in 2011.

But Yoga Club offers courses for beginners.
It introduces students to yoga as an exercise in

Greenﬁeld ﬁnds it to be exceptionally soothing.

After sitting at a desk all day studying, relax-

Zumba is becoming more popular as fans of
“Dancingwith the Stars” get inspired by the salsa
and tango sessions that have dancers rocking
sleek silhouettes. This latin-inspired dance has
been known to be addictive and acts as a work-
out that has participants unknowingly burning
calories. Rogers immediately said that Zumba
was “very trendy among students.”

""It’s almost midnight on ajanuary evening in
Oakland, and thousands of Pitt students sit
anxiously around their computers.

Except, they aren’t studying.

That’s because the online Pitt athletics

An hour before a February 2011
home game between the Pitt men’s
basketball team and its Backyard
Brawl rival, West Virginia, a Pitt stu-
dent dressed in a gold shirt, navy
gym shorts, high white socks and
a headband stood behind a row of
courtside seats. He intently watched
the Mountaineers’ warm ups.

He paraded a mock—up of Joe
Mazzulla’s mug shot and shouted
Mazzulla’s name in an attempt to
taunt him. Much to the student’s
surprise, the West Virginia guard,
who has hadseveral run-ins with
police, came over, signed the mug
shot and then resumed his warm up.
Both walked away with a grin.

Life ofel Pz'ttfem.° Supporting‘ T

the Pam‘/aers can be up—ez7/zei-
eloum experience

Isaac Saul '
Senior Staff Writer

The life ofthe Pitt fan can be a painful
existence.
As you would expect, being an athlete
or team in the “City of Champions” —— a
popular nickname for Pittsburgh due to
the large number of trophies its teams
V have collected over the years —— comes
with incredible pressure to succeed. Simi-
larly, beinga fan in the “City of Cham-
pions” comes with blinding pride, high
expectations and an unyielding, burning
hatred for losing. _f
At Pitt, we have suffered heartbreak.
Most recently, it came in the form of an
inconceivable foul against Butler in the
2011 NCAA Tournament that prematurely
knocked our No. 1—seeded Panthers out
of the Big Dance.

We have overcome tribulations. They‘

came in the form of four head football
coaches in less than two years. .

But being a.Pitt fan isn’t all bad. This
past year was an outlier in terms of strug-

gle, and the-victories of the past continue"

to better define Pitt’s sports.

We have won championships. They
recently came in bunches as we tore
through basketball’s' most competitive
conference. On the, football field, they
came at a time when Afros and disco mu-
sic were cool and nobody could’bring
down Tony Dorsett, who won the 1976,
Heisman Trophy and led Pitt to its ‘last
national championship the same season.

And, of course, we have our rivalries.
Nothing beats the tension of Pitt and West
Virginia fans sharing a stadium or arena.

Few things compare to the buzz you
will feel when you return to Oakland
from Heinz Field or the Petersen Events
Center knowing that Pitt just dominated
those annoying Mountaineers from next
door. For the Pitt fan, there is something
unbearably ugly about that Mountaineer
blue and yellow — so similar to our blue
and gold, yet so remarkably different.

With the label of Pitt Athletics comes
a tradition few can rival.

Pitt remains one of only ﬁve Division I
schools to have multiple national champi-
onships infootball (nine) and basketball
(two) — even though those titles were
won decades ago. Names like Dan Ma-
rino, Mike Ditka and Tony Dorsett will
represent us forever, The Panther itself
is a metaphor for the school’s athletic
dominance. It was, at one time, the most
powerful animal that roamed western
Pennsylvania. '

‘ But the life of the Pitt fan isn’t just
about wins and losses — even in the “City
of Champions.” .

The life of the Pitt fan is about the
echoing deafness you’ll experience in
the Oakland Zoo student section when
the lights go out at the Petersen Events
Center as our starting lineup takes the
court. The life of the Pittfan is about the
satisfaction you feel from crumpling up
that newspaper rostter sheet and joining

the Zoo in the madness that is called col— ' S

lege basketball. , _

It’s also about camaraderie. The Pitt
fan knows camaraderie when he or she
spends a winter afternoon weathering a
Pitt football tailgate. The Pitt fan knows
camaraderie when he o.r she hears those

first notes of “Sweet Caroline” — the - »

popular tune that has recently become
a momentum=shifting traditionfor the
Panthers at the end of the third quar-
ter' —— blaring through the speakers at
Heinz Field.

Sometimes, the life of the Pitt fan can

come with some obscurity. Take pride

in, our quality wrestling program. Find
excitement in the successful Ultimate
Frisbee team. Cheer on the swimmers,
track_ runners, or even rugby and vol-
leyball athletes. The Pitt fan can always
ﬁnd someone to root for. T

And, as we’ve seen this year, the life
of the Pitt fan can be challenging. Some-
times the Pitt fan‘ is one of the stunned
faces on the Petersen Events Center jum-
botron, staring in shock as Long Beach
State leaves our building with a very rare
victory.

fan so special.

The Pitt fan knows that wins don’t
come without losses, that national cham-
pionships are not earned by quitterslor
pouters.

When Pitt fans experience those dif-
ﬁcult-to—swallow losses, they rally be-
hindltheir teams with support, knowing
that being a Panther means those wins
will come. Just this past season, when
the Pitt basketball team’s disappointing

_ season appeared to be over, the Panthers

accepted a bid to the obscure College
Basketball Invitational and won a cha/m-
pionship — eventhough it wasn’t quite
the one we wanted.

The life of the Pitt fan can be a painful

existence, butlwith that existence will.

come numerous experiences that will
make four years of college here a lot more
memorable. ‘

Professional teams give meaning to ‘City of Champions’

RJ Sepich and Donnie Tasser
The Pitt News Stcﬁ

There are two things that people who are not

* from Pittsburgh think of when they envision

the Steel City: pollution and professional sports.
Although the days of steel mills belching
smoke into the air and contaminating the city
have passed, the dominance of Pittsburgh pro-
fessional sports teams remains.
“Pittsburgh has long been a center of sport,”
said Rob Ruck, a Pitt history professor and not-

. ed sports historian. “It has an incredible record

of achievement in the 20th century unmatched
by any city of comparable size.”

With four professional sports teams ‘that
hold a combined 14 championships, as well as
competitive collegiate athletic teams at Pitt, it
would be hard to ﬁnd a better sports city than
Pittsburgh in this country. ,

Over the years, the Pittsburgh Steelers,
Penguins and — before most of us were born
—-— Pirates, have dominated their respective
leagues. And just last year, the “City of Cham-

V pions” added another professional team to

the mix — the Pittsburgh Power of the Arena
Football League.

Pittsburgh Steelers .

The Pittsburgh Steelers are perhaps the
most popular professional football team in the
U.S. Parts ‘of the “Steeler Nation” can be found
all across America — represented by jerseys,
sports bars, tattoos and other memorabilia. The
Terrible Towel,‘ the rally towel of the Steelers,
often decks out storefronts in the Strip District
and dorm rooms, among other locations.

“There are a lot of people who leave Pitts-
burghbutstayintouchwith Pittsburgh through
sport,” Ruck said. “Theymight be 20 or 30
years removed from Pittsburgh, but they keep

identifying through the Steelers.” .-

Butwith six Super Bowl titles under its belt,
the most accomplished team of the Super Bowl
era has its share of haters as well. A

“I hate the Steelers,” said Christian Fagan, a
recently graduated Pitt student originally from
Boston. “Their fans are obnoxious, and they em-
ploy several cheap shot artists on their team.”-

“I’m really glad the Packers beat them,”
he said, referencing the Steelers’ defeat at the
hands of the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl
XLV two years ago, “because I don’t think I
could take the gloating from Steeler fans for
another year.” «

The Steelers, who have appeared in eight
Super Bowls, share the 65,000-seat Heinz Field
with Pitt’s football team, but Steelers tickets
are expensive and can be difﬁcult to come by.

Pittsburgh Penguins .

After a spell of terrible play in the late ‘90s
and early 2000s, the Pittsburgh Penguins hit
the lottery interrns of draft picks. ’

In 2005, the Penguins chose Sidney Crosby
with the ﬁrst overall pick, and with otheryoung
stars like Evgeni Malkin,Jordan Staal and Marc-
Andre Fleury, they rose from the abyss of the
National Hockey League to become one of the
league’s most consistent winners. V

This rise to prominence reached its apex in

Summer 2012 | The Pitt News 1 vx/\/wv.pittnevve.e0m

2009 when the Penguins defeated the Detroit
Red Wings — who beat them in the ﬁnals the
yearbefore —— in athrilling, seven—game Stanley
Cup Finals.

“The Penguins deﬁnitely won me over,” said
Victor Konno, a newly graduated Pitt student
from eastern Pennsylvania. “I was — and still
am — a Newjersey Devils fan ﬁrst, but since
coming to Pittl have really embraced the Pens.
Going to watch the game at the big screen is a
really good time, and the new arena — which
I haven’t been inside of yet, unfortunately —
looks really sweet.” I

In what became atradition during the Pen-
guins’ last years at their former home‘ of the

Mellon Arena, the team would set up a giant
screen in the parking lot for fans to watch the
playoffs. Fans unable to get tickets routinely
planted themselves in the crowd in front of the
screen to watch the game. The screen, along
with the team, made the transition to the luxuri-
ous new Consol Energy Center Downtown on
Fifth Avenue last season.

The Pens are very student—friendly as well.

_ The American Eagle Student Rush program

reserves 200 or more tickets for-every home
game for anyone with a high school or college
student ID. The tickets, for seats that could be
located anywhere in the arena, only cost $25,

Although itis ofﬁcially unknownwhen the trans-
fer will take place, the Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence is already preparing for the arrival of the
Pittsburgh Panthers. V

The ACC recently grouped its 14 future pro-
grams into two seven-team divisions that will
oﬁicially take effect when its two newest mem-

’ bers — Pitt and Syracuse ’—— join the conference
in either 2013 or 2014.

The realignment placed the Panthers in the
Coastal Division, whichwlll" also include Duke,
North Carolina, Miami (Fla.), Virginia, Georgia
Tech and Virginia Tech. Pitt has a combined
record of 33-45-1 against these opponenm on
the football ﬁeld — seeing most of this action
against Miami (Fla.) and Virginia Tech prior to
their departures from the Big East to the ACC
in 2003.

The ACC’s other division will be named the

AtlanticDivision,vvithSyracuse,BostonCollege, 5

Clemson, Florida State, Maryland, North Caro-
lina State and Wake Forest all set to compete
against each other.

The decision comes a few months after the

armouncement that Pitt and Syracuse would be _

leaving the Big East for the ACC. '

After spendingthe previous 30 seasons play-
ing in the Big East, the Panthers and the Orange
applied to join the ACC last September. A day
later, voters representing the ACC reviewed
the application and accepted both teams to the
conference.

But Pitt and Syracuse quickly found out that
switching conferences isn’t a simple process.

For teams toleave the Big East, they must
ﬁrst give the conference 27 months notice and
pay a $5 million opt-out fee. But as West Virginia
proved last February, the length of the waiting
period is‘ negotiable.

The Mountaineers agreed to pay a combined
$20 million to the Big East in order to leave
the conference immediately following the 2012
spring sports season.

Earlier this year, Pitt athletic director Steve
Pederson said that to “protect the interests of

this institution,” Pittwill not pay more than the N

$5 million exit fee to leave the conference before
27 months pass, which could leave the Panthers
waitinguntil 2o14’before being allowed to ﬁnal-
ize the switch to the ACC.

Butjohn Marinatto, who recently stepped
down as Big East' commissioner, hinted a little
later that afterthe Big East added several schools
to replace Pitt, Syracuse and West Virginia for
2013, the conference may allow the Panthers
and Orange to join the ACC in the summer of

' 2013.

But following Marinatto’s exit, the relation-
ship between Pitt and the Big East broke down.

Tired of waiting for a ﬁnal decision about
when it will be allowed to complete its move
to the ACC, Pitt ﬁled a lawsuit against the Big
East on May 11 in an attempt to expedite its
departure from the conference and to receive

lost home games against West Virginia, Texas
Christian University and Central Florida in 2012.

“A few weeks ago, Steve Pederson met with
John Marrinato to begin the process to work
toward an exit after this upcoming academic

' year,” Pitt Athletics spokesman E.J. Borghetti
. said in a statement after Pitt ﬁled the lawsuit.

“However, attempts to contact the Big East in
the following weeks to move the process forward
have been unsuccessﬁil, leading us to conclude
that negotiations would not occur.”

Until the lawsuit is settled or the Big East
ﬁnally decides what it wants to do for the 2013
season, the fate of Pitt and Syracuse athletics
for that yearwill remain amystery. V

Pitt might still be on board to participate
in the Big~East for the 2012 football season,
but many fans are more excited for the non-
conference game next season thatwill preview
Pitt football post—transition to the ACC. On Sat-

urday, Sept. 15, Pittwillwelcome future Coastal _ 

Division rival Virginia Tech to Heinz Field.

Although the uncertainties remain about
the exact date Pitt will begin competing in the
ACC, the scheduling outlook for the Panthers
is set once they ﬁnally complete the confer-
ence switch. .

In football, along with facing all Coastal
Division opponents, Pitt willhave a primary
crossover partnership  Syracuse, meeting
the Orange every year. The Panthers will also
face two other members of the Atlantic Division,
playing each team twice over six years.

On the basketball court, the ACC will move
away from the divisional format to play an 18-
garne schedule of rotating opponents, and each
teamwillhave apartner it will be guaranteed to
face twice every season. Pitt will be paired up
with the University of Maryland, which owns a
5-2 all—time record against the Panthers.

Athletes from other sports have expressed
positive feedback about the prospect of joining

.the ACC. O _

W “It’s very exciting,” said Ethan Mildren, a
rising junior pitcher on the Pitt baseball team.
“We’ll play some good competition, some of the
top teams in the country, and hopefully we can
even keep some of our current Big East rivalries.”

Maintainingthese old rivalries is also a prior-
ity in football and basketball.

Pitt’s Backyard Brawl rivalry with West Vir-
ginia in both football and basketball might be
discontinued because of the ACC’s tight out-
oﬁconference scheduling. The Panthers will
no longer travel annually to schools such as St.

John’s, Connecticut and Villanova, which might
cause Pitt to move its primarily New England
recruiting base farther south.’ , —

This issue of continuing long-time Big East
rivalries doesn’t look likely to be resolved any
time soon, meaning the Panthers could be
forced to develop new rivalries once they en-
ter the ACC. , '

For the second consecutive spring practice
session, the Pitt football team went to work
installing new offensive and defensive systems.
Following the unexpected departure of last
season’s head coach, Todd Graham, to Arizona
State, former Wisconsin offensive coordinator
Paul Chryst was named the new head coach of
Pitt’s football team and was tagged with the
duty of implementing his system this spring.
Chryst’s system will strike many Pitt fans
as similar to that of Dave Wannstedt, the Pitt
alumnus who coached the Panthers before Gra-
ham. It is a run—ﬁrst offense looking to pass the

- ball on p1ay—action when the opposing defense

expects the run.

Wisconsin’s offense excelled under Chryst
last season.

The Badgers’ balanced attack averaged
more than 200 yards per game both passing
and rushing and ﬁnished sixth in the country
with 44.1 points per game. Wisconsin’s running
back Montee Ball also tied the NCAA record
for touchdowns in a season with 39, ﬁnished

his fast—paced spread offense even whenit

struggled, Chryst has stated that he is trying
to learn the abilities of his players and build
an offense to ﬁt them. .

“I think getting to know the system, [the
coaches] getting to know [the players] and them
improving as players, more than anything, is
important now,” Chryst said. “We don’t have
a game, fortunately, for a while, and it’s about
improving individually.”

After watching Graham refuse to alter his
offense to accommodate the skills of Pitt quar-
terback Tino Sunseri, Panther fans will ﬁnd
comfort this year knowing that, at Wisconsin,
Chryst adapted his offense to suit mobile quar-

terback Russell Wilson.

Wilson found success with that change -
the Badgers won the Big Ten championship
then advanced to their second straight Rose
Bowl. ‘

Chryst and new offensive coordinatorjoe
Rudolph planto utilize another attackingaspect
of the game more frequently: the tight end as a
receiving option. The player in that position is
often said to be the quarterback’s best friend,
and Sunseri will beasked to look to his senior
tight end Hubie Graham.

“It is a unique situation that our tight ends
coach is also our offensive coordinator,” Gra-
ham said, referringto Rudolph. “The tight ends
are such a bigfpart of our offense. It’s a great
responsibility and opportunity for us to con-
tribute to the offense’s success.”

_ At Wisconsin, Chryst produced two All-
American tight ends and saw a tight end from
his school selected in the NFL Draft in each of
the last three years. Like Rudolph, Chryst has
abackground workingwith tight ends. Hewas
once the tight ends coach for the San Diego
Chargers, and he started at Wisconsin coaching
the same position.

A history of developing a strong offensive

 

 
   

line is also something that Chryst and his as-
sistants bringwith themfrom Wisconsin, which
means more will be expected out of Pitt’s line-
men this season.

“You have to like football to be around us,”
offensive line coach Jim Hueber said. “We’re
going to coach them hard and make sure they
prepare. We’re not going to accept mistakes.
We’re going to expect nothing but excellence,
and if we don’t get it, We’re going to try and get
it the next time.”

These expectations of excellence paid divi-
dends at Wisconsin. Chryst’s Badgers produced
four All-American linemen in his seven seasons

there. g

The Panthers’ offensive line will need to
stay healthy this year if it hopes to succeed.
Chris Jacobson, who missed almost all of last
season after suffering an injury, was granted a
sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA and will be
crucial to the offensive line along with senior
center Ryan Turnley.

“I feel like I can take control out there and
really help the other guys and be a leader out
there,” Turnley said. “I thinkthe other guys look
to me and Chrisjacobson for help with grasping
this system and trying to pick it up quickly.”
Other key players with injuries heading into

 

 

the spring included returning star running

back Ray Graham, linebacker Todd Thomasg...

safety Jarred Holley and wide receiver Mike
Shanahan. Corner K’Waun Williams also was
hurt and needed shoulder surgery in the middle
of spring practice.

For the wide receivers, the system change

has been welcomed, as it has allowed them _

to get back to the same routes and concepts
learned inthe Wannstedt era, just with different
names. For this reason, Shanahan shou1dn’tbe
too far behind entering summer camp.

Expect men’s, women’s basketball
teams to recover from tough years

Nate Barnes
Staff Wrz'ter

I’m not going.to lie to you: Pitt’s basketball
programs —— both men’s and women’s —‘
were terrible last season. 3

The men endured a month-long losing
stretch that they never fully recovered from.
They ﬁnished the regular season with a win-
ning percentage barely above .500 at 17-
16, with a mediocre 5-13 record in Big East
play. Not only did the Pitt men’s basketball
team fail to qualify for the NCAA Tourna-
ment for the ﬁrst time in a decade, it also
wasn’t invited to the National Invitational
Tournament, either. Rather, Pitt’s postseason
play occurred in the third—tier College Bas-
ketball Invitational, in which the Panthers
went 5-1 to capture a “championship” on
their home ﬂoor. Don’t expect a banner to
be raised over it. V

And despite what seemed like a promis-
ing start, the women’s team never truly got
anino‘ .It.lnr-.t,i+.s=_ l:=s,t 17_o.':ame.:,and went 0-16

in Big East play, including a humil'1ating,’in- "

comprehensible 76-point loss to N otre Dame.

But last year’s turmoil doesn’t necessarily
mean that the Panthers will continue their
slump for all of your four or so years at Pitt.
Trust me, both teams pack loads of potential
and offer hope to suffering Pitt fans for the
2012-2013 season and beyond.

Let’s start with the men. J A

Although the Panthers lost both their
leading scorer and rebounder following
the graduations of Ashton Gibbs and Nasir
Robinson, the departure of the two seniors
will lead to increased minutes for a trio of
talented young Pitt players ready to replace
them: rising juniors Talib Zanna,J.J. Moore
and Lamar Patterson. Patterson, who aver-
aged almost 10 points and ﬁve rebounds and
was named co-most-valuable—player by the
team in his sophomore year, and Moore, who
raised his game in the ﬁnal 13 contests of the
season by scoring 11.7 points per game, have
both shown glimpses of their abilities to excel
offensively. Zanna’s physical presence makes
him an ideal replacement for Robinson at
power forward.

Those three have the talent to ﬁll the void
left by Gibbs and Robinson on the court, and
there is no doubt that Travon Woodall, last
season’s other co-most-valuable—player, will
be the man to take over the primary leader-
ship role. The rising senior has shown his
mettle and talent time and time again in his
past two years as a starter, and, if he can
remain healthy, he will have full control of
the Pitt offense this coming season. Despite
missing 11 of the team’s 39 total games in
his junior year, Woodall still led the team
in assists at 6.1 per game and was the Pan-
thers’ second—leading scorer at 11.7 points

3 per game.

Pitt’s depth in the backcourt could be cru-
cial for its hopes of returning to_ the NCAA

Tournament next season.

In addition to Woodall, Patterson and
Moore,JohnJohnson, Cam Wright, Durand
Johnson and incoming recruitJames Robin-
son — the No. 4-ranked point guard and No.
43 overall prospect in the class of 2012 —— will
all vie for minutes this season.

Last year, John Johnson showed off his
3-point shooting ability, making 38.4 percent
of his shots from long range. Wright gained
more playing time as the season progressed,

exhibiting defensive prowess and athleticism -

that helped him score around the basket.
After redshirting, Durandjohnson also hopes
to make an impact with his athletic 6—foot—6
frame, and Robinson might see a few minutes
at point guard as he learns from Woodall.
In the paint, the Panthers will also cause
more matchup problems for opposing teams.
Although Nasir Robinson played harder
than nearly every player on the court, his
6-foot-5 body created mismatches in favor
of the opposition at the power forward slot

— in nearly every game.

Dull [ld.V 1115 LLCLSL1-L. cu nu. [U1 vvaq. u cuxu. \.L.:.r‘-

ter positions will not be a problem for Pitt
next season.
The 6-foot-9 Zanna will compete with

* 6-foot-9 senior Dante Taylor to start at power

forward, while 6—foot-11 sophomore Malcolm
Gilbert and 6—foot-10 Steven Adams, the No.
4-ranked center and No. 6 prospect overall in
the recruiting class of 2012, will add further
depth to the Panthers’ frontcourt.

The increase in minutes for all of these
players should pay early and substantial divi-
dends for the Panthers "in the 2012-2013 sea-
son. A potential starting lineup of Woodall,
Moore, Patterson, Zanna and Adams, who
is considered by some to be the most prized
recruit ever to commit to play basketball at
Pitt, should get Panthers fans excited for
the future. A I

Another factor that will assist Pitt’s
chances of succeeding in what could be its
ﬁnal season in the Big East —-— before switch-
ing to the Atlantic Coast Conference —- is
the signiﬁcant number of talented players
from other Big East teams departing to the
NBA draft or other professional leagues this
summer.

0 All six members of the 2012 All-Big East
First Team —-— Kevinjones of West Virginia,
Jae Crowder and Darius Johnson-Odom of
Marquette, Kris Joseph of Syracuse, Jason
Clark of Georgetown and Jeremy Lamb "of
Connecticut —-— either graduated or declared
for the NBA draft, leaving the conference

bereft of star power heading into the new _

season. _

With this loss of talent, the Big East sched-'_
ule will likely not pose as much of a challenge
for the Panthers as it did last year, and this
could lead to more wins for Pitt in its quest
to return to the top of the conference.

Several other Pitt club sports programs

Blake joined the crew team her freshman

“We have people who join the team as ju-

Staclerz ts can exercise at several
locations across campus

Eric Burrage
Staﬁ’ -Wrz'ter ,

They might not perform in front of thousands
of screaming fans the  the Panthers football
and basketball teams do, but many Pitt students
stay physically active during the school year by
taking advantage of the numerous ﬁtness facili-
ties available across campus. , ‘

While students often pick their favorite facili-
ties based on their interests, it is important to
know the operating hours and locations of the
exercise centers. Recreational facilities exist
on both upper and lower campus and can be
split up -into three general categories: ﬁtness
facilities, sports facilities and aquatic facilities.

Keep in mind that Pitt identiﬁcation is usu-
ally required to enter these buildings.

Fitness

Students can lift weights and get cardio-
vascular exercise at several different ﬁtness
facilities across campus.

1, The Baierl Student Recreation Center pres-
ents the largest space and most comprehensive
set of workout equipment on campus, makingit
the most favorable ﬁtness facility in the eyes of
many students. The vast offerings also contrib—
ute to a high level of use, causing’ some to feel
that the center becomes overcrowded and less
efficient than other workout options.

Trees Hall on upper campus and Belleﬁeld
Hall —— across from Heinz Chapel —— house

slightly smaller workout facilities. Although

these aren’t usually packed to capacity the way
that Baierl can be, most students agree that the
later it gets in the day, the more likely it is that
a facility will become crowded.

Students living in on-campus housing can
take advantage of a multitude of facilities in
dormitories and residence halls. There are small
ﬁtness centers in many of the residence halls,
including Litchﬁeld Towers and Sutherland,
Lothrop, Pennsylvania and Panther halls.

Finally, the Fitzgerald Field House is an.up—
per-carnpus facility that provides a 200-meter
indoor track on which students can run orwalk
during select hours of the day.

Sports ,

As their name implies, the sports facilities
are locations at which students can engage in
a variety of recreational or organized team ac-
tivities, ranging from basketball to racquetball.

Sports facilities are available across cam-
pus at the Baierl Recreation Center, Trees Hall,
Belleﬁeld Hall, the Fitzgerald Field House and
the Cost Sports Center. Because each facility is
different, students should consider what sport
they want to play when deciding where they
plan on going. , _

Those looking to play basketball can select
from Trees ‘Hall, whﬂichlprovides three full-size
courts, and Belleﬁeld Hall, which has one full-
size basketball court open during the same
hours as the building’s ﬁtness facility. There is

also aset of outdoor courts located across from
the VA Hospitalpri upper campus.

Field sports like football, lacrosse, Ultimate

: Frisbee or soccer canbe played atthe Cost Sports

Center, located on top of the hill near Suther-
land Hall. It provides several outdoor ﬁelds for
students to use, weather permitting, and it also
contains accommodating indoor spaces for
additional ﬂexibility. The Cost Sports Center
has nine indoor tennis courts and an indoor
football ﬁeld that can be converted into four
smaller soccer ﬁelds depending on what sport
students want to play. --

Racquetball is another sport that many
students enjoy playing on campus. The most
popular racquetball facility is located at the
Baierl Recreation Center, which has a total of
four racquetball courts available for student use
during the same hours asithe rest of tire facility.
Trees Hall also provides a facility for students
to play racquetball or handball.

At Trees Hall, a rock-climbing wall and a
golf practice area await student use. Students
can rent climbing equipment for a small fee. 

Volleyball is one sport that is not always
available for student participation. Courts are
periodically set up in the Fitzgerald Field House
as well as. in. the sports  11.1 Trees Hall. Stu-
dents should look for additional information or
announcements to ﬁnd out when these facilities
may be used. . .

Also, students frequently play a variety of
sports inthefalland spring months on the lawns
surrounding the Cathedral of Learning.
Aquatic ' ’

Trees Hall houses an Olympic—size swim-.
ming pool and a smaller pool, and Belleﬁeld
Hall gives students access to one small pool.

Incorningfreshmen and new students aim-
ing to remain active in their ﬁrst year at Pitt
should not hesitate to takeadvantage of the
numerous exercise facilities available to them.
By getting afeel for all of these facilities and what
they have_ to offer, students can better decide
which ones suit them best and can give therri

Get to know the best of the rest of Pitt athletics

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Wrz'ter

While major sports such as football, basket-
ball, baseball and soccer draw the biggest
crowds and garner the most media attention
at the University level, the realm of Pitt athlet-
ics extends beyond these sports to encompass
a wide variety of competition.

Like the big—name athletes on campus who
consistently ﬁll Heinz Field, the Petersen
Events Center and the Petersen Sports Com-

. plex, the student athletes involved in more

less-followed sports also dedicate a signiﬁcant
chunk of time and effort to their teams.

' Here’s a breakdown of the lesser—known
—— but sometimes more successful — Pan-
thers sports.

Cross Country

Alonzo Webb has coached both the men’s
and the women’s cross country squads since
2002. The teams compete in meets beginning
in September and ending with regional and

national championships in late November.

Although Pitt does not have a home course,
it does participate annually in two localmeets
hosted by Duquesne and Carnegie Mellon at
Schenley Park._

This past season, current juniors Ben Kis-
ley and Rich Addison led the Panthers on
the men’s side. Kisley and Addison ﬁnished

second and ﬁrst, respectively, for Pitt at the
NCAA regional competition. Sophomore Mor-
gan Perry paced the women’s side at the meet.

Addison and Kisley also led the men at the
Big East Championships, while Perry and ju-
nior Stephanie Powers were the top—ﬁnishing
female Panthers. _ _

With young talent returning to the squad
next season, Webb anticipates a successful
2012 campaign.

“We strive to get a little better each day,
and that will carry over,” Webb said. “We will
aim to improve and come back strong next
fall.’’

. Track and Field -

Webb is also the head coach for both track

and ﬁeld teams, which begin competing in

the spring in meets that continue through
earlyjune. *

i The men’s and women’s squads do not
have home meets, so they travel throughout

the season to attend both open meets and 0

invitationals.‘
The current season has been a record-

setiing one for Pitt junior Brycen Spratling, _

who recently broke the school record for the
2100-meter dash and hopes to make this year’s
Olympic team.

Spratling, who transferred to Pitt this year
from Central Michigan, attributes his accom-
plishments to hard work and commitment.

“I have beenworking harder this year than

I ever have,” Spratling said. “I have been really
fortunate to break records for Pitt.”

The women’s squad boasts several sopho-
mores looking to continue their contributions
for the Panthers in the coming years.

Sophomores Casey Meier and Brooke
Shasteen both qualiﬁed for the Big East Cham-
pionships in the javelin competition, while
classmate Brittany Lightfoot did likewise in
the shot put event.

Swimming and Diving

The swimming and diving seasons for both
the men and the women typically begin in‘
early October with an intrasqaud Blue—Gold
meet and conclude with the Big East Cham-
pionships in February.

Under the direction of Chuck Knoles -—
six—tim_e Big East Men’s Swimming Coach of
the Year — the teams host meets on campus
at Trees Pool, across from the Fitzgerald Field
House.

The men’s and women’s teams both had
strong ﬁnishes to the 2011 regular season
with three consecutive meet victories. In the
Big East Championships, held at Trees, the
women’s squad placed fourth overall, and the
men ﬁnished third.

Knoles said he was impressed with his
teams’ performances this year.

“We had a great year on both the men’s and
women’s sides,” Knoles said after the Big East
Championships. “We set many school records

and had ﬁnalists in just about every event.”

Knoles has been the coach of the Panthers,

squads for 22 years and will return in 2012
with two talented teams.

Wo men’s Volleyball
With a nationally recognized incoming
freshman class, women’s volleyball head

coach Toby Rens is excited for the upcomfﬁ‘

ing volleyball season.

PrepVolleyball.com gave Pitt’s recruiting
class an honorable mention distinction in its
annual reports, and Rens believes that the
team’s young talent will also mesh well with
the returning Panthers.

“This class has a winning mentality and
competitive attitude,” Rens said. “We are ex-
cited to have them join the Pitt family, and our
returning players are excited for the entire
group to start working together in August.”

The 2011 squad ﬁnished with a winnin

18-15 record and, after competing in the chal—V V

lenging Big East, earned a bid in the confer—
ence tournament.

Despite an early exit in the ﬁrst round, the
experience should’ prove beneﬁcial in 2012,
as the Panthers return ﬁve of six starters and
lose only two seniors.

The Panthers play their matches at the
Fitzgerald Field House during the fall. 0

4 WRESTUNG

Wrestling team seeks fourth consecutive conference title

Dustin Gabler
"\ Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Over the last few years, the Pitt wrestling team
has ﬂourished into one of the most successﬁil

__ athletic programs on campus.

This past season, the Panthers brought
home their best ﬁnish in 23 years when they
ﬁnished in the top 15 nationally at the three-
day NCAA Tournament in St. Louis, Mo. Two
Pitt wrestlers also ﬁnished as All-Americans.

But the three—time defending Eastern Wres-
tling League champions now face the task of
replacing a trio of wrestlers from the 2011-
2012 squad, including two four-time national
qualiﬁers.

Rising senior Anthony Zanetta believes re-
placing last year’s seniors presents a challenge
to the current squad.

“It’s always hard to replace the seniors,”
Zanetta said, “but it just gives an opportunity
for someone else to step in the lineup.”

One of the members leaving the team is
Ethan Headlee, who wrestled at 184 pounds
for the Panthers and qualiﬁed for the NCAA
Tournament four times in his career.

Also leaving is 149-pound Tyler Nauman,
who ﬁnished in ﬁfth place at nationals in his
ﬁnal season and was tied late in his semiﬁnal
match with a shot at the national title. Nau-
man capped his career with his second trip to
the podium, earning All-American status for

place all-time Pitt record.

Redshirtjunior P.J. Tasser commented on
two of the wrestlers’ departures.

“It’s always tough to lose seniors,” he said.
“Especially with a group that included Naurnan,
whowas atwo-time NCAA placer, and Headlee,
who was a four~time NCAA qualiﬁer.”

184—pound and heavyweight weight classes,
respectively.

Max Thomusseit’s performance should keep
head coach Rande Stottlemyer from seeing any
dropoffatthe 184—pound weight class, despite
the team’s loss of four-time NCAA qualiﬁer
Headlee. At heavyweight, Max’s older brother
Zac will be an upgrade from sophomore Joel
Yahner, who struggled in his ﬁrst college sea-
son. .

“We have a great group of guys returning, 
cluding the Thomusseit brothers,” Tasser said.
“Our freshmen also really stepped up for us this
year. Our recruiting class is a great one, and
we are really excited about next year already.”

Tasser surprised the EWL by jumping
weight classes to wrestle as a heavyweight for
the Panthers at the conference tournament.

ﬁrst NCAA Tournament.

While Pitt’s basketball and football teams

vania high school football history. He also

V set national records by rushing for at least

100 yards in 39 straight games, and he ran

for 200 or more yards 25 times in his career.

Shell’s career yardage places him 10th all-
time nationally for rushing yards. Shell is
ranked the fourth—best running back and
2oth—best player overall in the class of 2012.
He was also chosen to play in the Semper

ranked as the fourth—best quarterback and
109th-best prospect overall in the class of
2012.

Adam Bisnowaty, Offensive tackle

6-foot—6, 275 pounds

Fox Chapel High School, Pittsburgh

Bisnowaty should add immediate depth
to an offensive line that struggled last sea-
son. Like Shell, he was chosen for the Semper

as the 19th-best offensive tackle in the na-
tion and 2o3rd—best prospect overall from

Deaysean Rippy ﬁnished his junior sea-

tackles and 17 sacks. He also had more than
700 yards and 10 touchdowns as a receiver.
With athleticism and versatility that might
help him move back to safety, Rivals.com

Young Panthers hope to compete for baseball championships

Brian Batko

Though its second year playing atthe Charles
L. Cost Field was a bit of a step back when
compared to the 2011 campaign, the Pitt base-
ball team still has high hopes of becoming
one of the best athletics programs on campus

T ‘»thanks to a slew of talented young players and

top-notch facilities.

While the football and basketball teams
garner most of the headlines, Pitt baseball
manager Joe Jordano has built a program
well worth the price of admission to games,
which — for anyone with a Pitt ID — is free.

The team plays its home games at the.

upper campus. Because of the new fan— and
player—friendly facilities, which mark a huge
improvement overthe Panthers’”old home at
' Trees Field, the college sports website Rivals.
com recently declared Pitt one of “college
baseball’s rising programs.” And Jordano,
who recently reached 700 careerwins — 400
of which he recorded at Pitt —— is one of the
premier managers in the Big East conference.
Since his hiring in 1997, he has become the
most successful baseball coach in school his-
tory by a large margin.
This past season, the Panthers snuck
into the Big East Tournament as the No. 8
seed despite a 10-17 conference record. And

l

with only three players graduating, Jordano’s
team should ﬁnd itself higher up the Big East
standings next year in what could be its last
season in the conference before moving to
the Atlantic Coast Conference with most of
Pitt’s athletic programs. g g

Mildren and Wotherspoon are two right-
handers who, along with alumnus Matt Ian-

weekend starters in 2012. A local player from
Laurel Highlands High School, Mildren was
named Big East Pitcher of the Week for the
week of April 2, while teammates Wother-

ente and middle inﬁelders Evan Oswald and

g Derik Wilson, among others.

The Panthers’ roster is also littered with
western Pennsylvania talent, featuring play-
ers frorn high schools such as North Allegh-
eny, Gateway, Allderdice and'Butler.

Despite struggling in Big East play for
much of 2012, Pitt’s season did have a few
highlights. _

The Panthers recorded a 5-3 victory at

home over Penn State — their ﬁrst win
against their in-state rival since 2010 and just
a few weeks after the Nittany Lions defeated
Pitt in State College, Pa.

“They had our number the last couple
times we played them,” Parente said, “but
we got some nice at—bats out of some guys
and timely hitting.”

The team also showed its offensive po-
tential last season. Pitt scored nine runs or
more on almost a dozen occasions, including
22 against Wofford and 14 in a victory over
rival West Virginia.

The Panthers ﬁnished the season on a
strong note by winning back-to—back confer-
ence series against Georgetown and Rutgers.

As for the upcoming transition to the ACC,
Jordano has embraced the move since it was

. ﬁrst reported and many of his players feel
the same way. ‘ 

“It’s very exciting,” Mildren said. “We’ll
play some good competition, some of the
top teams in the country, and hopefully we
can even keep some of our current Big East
rivalries.”

Jordano said that although expectations 

for the next few years are steep, he realizes
his young group of players have a long way
to go before competing for conference and
national championships.

“It’s one of those things where you can’t

teach experience,” Jordano said. “You have —

to live it.” I 4 ‘

SOFTBALL

I‘.

%ePitt softball hasn't suffered losing season since 2008

 Sepich
S]>orts'Edz'tor

Since its establishment in 1998, the Pitt
softball team has slowly become one of
the most successful athletic programs on

= campus.

After struggling to earn a foothold in
the competitive Big East Conference for the

first decade of the program’s history, the
g Panthers have ﬂourished under fourth—year

head coach Holly Aprile, who led the team

to three straight winning seasons since tak-

ing the job. — A
And even though this season has been a

I transitional one, the Panthers still ﬁnished

with a 26-26 record and sent off the" ﬁrst
«senior class in the program’s history that
has never suffered a losing season.
Perhaps the biggest contributing factor

to the transitional nature of this season
was that the Panthers" two starting pitchers
were both freshmen.

' Coach Aprile believes that the pitching
duo of Savannah King and Alexa Larkin can
help Pitt’s softball program to continue in

A the right direction.

“Together, they’re a pretty solid foun-
dation for our program, and if they can
continue to learn and get better, they can
help us take that step to the next level,”
Aprile said. O

For Aprile, that next level is for Pitt to
begin competing for conference champion-
ships. ‘

“We’ve established ourselves in the con-
ference, and now we have to be able to show
up and beat the better teams in the confer- ‘
ence on a more consistent basis,” she said.

King, who originally hails from Califor- 4
nia, already broke the school record for I
most wins in a season during her ﬁrst year
at Pitt. But she said that there is still room
for signiﬁcant improvement from both
herself and Larkin. -

“We want to take this program as far
as we possibly can,” King said. “But it’s a
game—by-game process of getting better

, everyday in order to reach those ultimate‘

goals.” ~

Larkin agreed and said that the two have
a great relationship.

“We know that we’re there for each other
and will support each other,” she said.

Although Pitt lost eight seniors from this
year’s roster at graduation, the ﬁiture of the
program remains bright with King, Larkin
and the other six members of the talented
rising sophomore class who are set to lead
the team for the next three years.

Maggie Sevilla has blossomed into one
of the team’s best hitters, and ﬁrst-year
second baseman Carissa Throckmorton has
established herself as a permanent starter

The Panthers also have another large,

by the departing seniors as Pitt prepares to
join the Atlantic Coast Conference.

The team plays its games on campus
during the spring at Vartabedian Field in
the new Petersen Sports Complex, behind
Trees Hall. Aprile said that the new facili-
ties have helped immensely in recruiting

because there is such a drastic improve-
ment over the Panthers’ old playing ﬁeld.
“When I got here, the ﬁeld was basically

a cut-out of dirt and it deﬁnitely wasn’t
spectator-friendly at all,” she said. “But

I knew the program was building, and I
wanted to be a part of it.”

Luxbacher agreed and believes that having

In a stadium that seats more than 12,500
fans, only 1,400 seats in sections 6A— 6] are
iieserved for students. These seats encom-
pass most of the lower bowl of the Petersen

. Events Center, nearest to the court.

This means that unlike football tickets,
men’s basketball tickets are somewhat dif-
ﬁcult to come by. For this reason, students
must participate in a competitive process in
which they accumulate loyalty points: . ' '
.. “I always enjoyed registering for basket-
ball tickets. It was pretty easy for me fresh-
man year, and I never had any problems,”
senior Ben Koch said. “Loyalty points are

§/vhile women’s tickets are free. Exhibition_
game tickets for the men’s team cost only $2.

 To buy tickets, go to the_my.pitt portal

and log in to your student account; Click on
“Athletics Logini’ in the bottom right-hand
garner of the.Website and then “Request/

’ Claim Tickets.” Finally, select the game you

73/Vish to attend.

The more loyalty points students collect,
the more likely they are to be selected to
receive a ticket to the next game. However,
having a lot of loyalty points does not guar-
antee a student a ticket over a student with
fewer loyalty points.

The lottery system that determines which
students receive tickets is a game of chance.
A student with ﬁve loyalty points will not
always be awarded a ticket over a student
with only one loyalty point — it’s just more
probable that will be the case. The advantage
of having ﬁve loyalty points is that the stu-
dent’s name will be entered into the virtual
drawing four more times than the student
with only one loyalty point.

For games wherethe student demand

doesn’t exceed the number of tickets avail-
able in the Oakland Zoo, all students who
request a ticket will be awarded a ticket and
loyalty points if they attend.

Students who are awarded a ticket
through the lottery system are notiﬁed of

_ their selection via email. They are then given

a two—day claim period. Students must claim
and pay for their tickets within 48 hours, or
they will be offered to students placed on
the waiting list.

While students are awarded loyalty points
for attending games, they can also be docked
points for not going to a game that they have
purchased a ticket for. To avoid penalization,
students must cancel their ticket by noon
two days prior to game day.

Getting basketball tickets is one part of
the experience. Arriving at the game is an-
other.

“Don’t be late — or you will miss the ex-

citing announcing—of—players ritual,” junior _,‘_

Allison Crawford said. T

This exciting pre-game ritual includes
heckling the other team during warm-ups,
welcoming the Panthers onto the ﬂoor, sing-
ing the National Anthem, and energizing
the crowd as the Oakland Zoo jumps up and

down during player introductions, at which "-3"

time the entire arena goes dark except for a
single spotlight on the team.

WOMEN’S SOCCER

New coezc/aezttempts to revive struggling women} soccerpmgmmil

Thirteen was an unlucky number for the Pitt

women’s SOCCCF team last season.

/‘Kg:

That’s the number of times the Panthers
were shut out en route to a 2-13-4 record
(1-8-2 in the Big East). The‘ disappointing
season resulted in the program going in a
new direction with _its head coach.

Under new head coach Greg Miller, who
served as an associate head coach for the
2010 Big Ten champions, the Ohio State
Buckeyes, the team hopes to rebound instead
of rebuild and return to the postseason for
the ﬁrst time since 2008.

“Coach Miller is awesome,” senior for-
ward Ashley Cuba said. “Our team is a com-
plete 180 from last year. He asks more from
us individually and is alwayspositive. Our

‘ “mentality is different. We were down on our-

selves a lot last season, even when we won.
This year, we expect more from ourselves,
and we are working hard.”

Cuba also said that the Panthers are al-
ready working on ﬁxing the goal-scoring
problem that plagued them last season.

“There’s always more to work on, and
so far this spring, we have done a lot more
offensive work, which was our biggest weak-
ness last year,” she said. ,

The Panthers have won more games in

their spring exhibitions alone than they did
all of last fall, opening the spring season 4-0
and outscoring opponents 9-2. They were
outscored 46-14 last season. The most telling

of these wins was a 3-2 nail-biter over 2011',

NCAA Tournament participant Maryland,
who advanced to the Sweet Sixteen last year.
“While we played some decent soccer at
times in both games, we still weren’t as con-
sistent on both sides of the ball as we would
have hoped to be at this point in the spring,”
Miller said in a press release. “What needs to
be noted, though, is there were many great
moments to build on from these games.”

He added that the new coaching staff has
been pleased by the student-athletes’ desire
to improve. ' . .

“We need to work on ﬁnding ways to
persevere despite the adversity,” he said.
“As a staff, we are extremely proud of this
group and the sacriﬁces they have made to
be better.” ' _

Leading the way for the Panthers is Cuba,
a third—team All-Big East selection last sea-
son who has already set the school’s all—time

S goal-scoring mark of 21 in just three years.

“It’s pretty awesome having the recor ,”
Cuba said. “I never expected to be able to do
it in three years, and it’s nice to have it out
of the way. I can look back on that later as a

. great thing, but right now it’s on the back

burner. I want to win.”

program.

Besides Cuba, the Panthers have a few
other talented players looking to improve
under the new regime. A pair of juniors, for-
ward Dana DelleFemine and midﬁelder Katie
Lippert, will play a crucial role in helping Pitt
score more goals.

ﬁe of the unique experiences of a Pitt student’s
 atthe school.”

 Many students arrive several hours before
5€gme’s opening tipoff to secure the best seats

 Big East games. Tickets for students cost
 lottery system. ‘ C

_.i.;;;§?“‘»‘,‘The Zoo isn’t just about everything during
egame, but it’s the pregame stuff as well
 people showing up early, camping out,”
 'cka said. “In 2009,‘we played UConn when

  
   
   

' y were No. 1, and it was a noon tipoff on

aturday. I got there around 7 or 8 in the
rning on Friday, and I didn’t leave the Pete

 Dedication to basketball resonates with
 who ﬁll the Zoo. In early 2011, Pitt stu-
 Gombos attended an 89-81 win over

Nlarquette the day after he tore the ACL, MCL ‘

and meniscus in his right knee.

“Crutching all the way up to the Pete in
snowy conditions was a feat,” Gombos said.

‘Ell/Iy two roommates carried me part of the way

ﬁﬁe you see when an athlete gets hurt. I jumped

tip and down on just my left legfortwo hours.”
 It’s almost always worth it. Despite last
 disappointing season, which concluded

p"ressive 164-19 all—time record at the Petersen

Events Center.

 “When you’re playing some of the smaller

o.

  

, schools that aren’t used to the big-time at-

mosphere, those are the teams that really get
shaken up,”Jedlicka said. ‘ .
 But the bigger schools also struggle when
tfaveling to Pittsburgh. The Panthers are 9-0
against Top 5_ opponents at home in the Zoo
era.
 E “The Oakland Zoo is where Top 5 teams
come to die,” Schroeder said. “9-0 againstTop
 teams is unbelievable, and the team always
points to the Zoo as one of the reasons for
at recor .” .
‘C Schroeder said that the Zoo helps the team
1 y when it needs motivation. He recalled
Pitt’s thril]ingcome—from-behind 98-95 triple~ _

overtime win over West Virginia in February  ‘

golo as an example.

j ' ' _. :The winning atmosphere has helped culti-
yate the Zoo’s routine. Newspapers that contain

 teams’ lineups and directions for ﬁrst— i ‘V
_ timers to the student section rest on each seat

before the games, placed thereby Zoo leaders.
 -Duringpregame‘ introductions, Zoo mem-
actlike they're readingthe paperasthe op-
 sing lineup is announced and shout ‘%ud<s!”
ggter each player’s name. After. the coach’s
name, they shout, “He sucks too!” Then, the
papers are crumbled and tossed into the air
 the lights dim, a siren blasts and everybody
Eliartsjumpingfor the armouncement of Pitt’s

  

That jumping continues into the game every
time the opposition has possession of the ball.

A fan-favorite chant occurs when an op-
posing player fouls out. The Zoo chants his
steps —- “LEFT  RIGHT  LEFT ...” — as the
fouled—out player walks back to his bench and
yells “Sit down!” when he takes a seat. Players
have tried to throw off the Zoo by running in
place or by faking sitting down. Once, a coach
instructed his player to stand for the rest of
the game. -

As silly as some of the Zoo’s antics are, the
student section’s popularity and enthusiasm
have made it a valuable football recruiting tool
for the University.

* Redshirt senior Shayne Hale attended
a 2007 basketball game against Oklahoma
State, and by the end of the ﬁrst half he had

left his seat next to then-football coach Dave
Wannstedt and donned a gold shirt with the
Pitt students. He committed to the school less
than a month later.

Zoo members had former Pitt running back
and current Philadelphia Eagle LeSean McCoy
check a box next to his name on a poster -
signaling that he would be the next athlete to
commit to the University — when he sat with
the Zoo on a similar recruiting visit that year.

“These kids in high school, these juniors
and seniors, they want to see they’re going to
go to a school that can have some fun. They
want to be with the other students,” Jedlicka
said. “If they can jump around and let loose for
a while, that’s really what they’re looking for.
It worked for guys like McCoy, Hale, Henry
Hynoski  all these big-time recruits.”

Hale recently won Pitt’s Ed Conway Award
for most—improved defensive player at the con-
clusion of spring practices. McCoy rushed for
1,309 yards for the Eagles last season, and
Hynoski won a Super Bowl in his rookie year
with the New York Giants. .

The growth of the Zoo has also brought
celebrities into the fray. Members of the Pitts-
burgh Steelers frequently attend Pitt games,
and former Panthers wide receiver and current
Arizona Cardinal Larry Fitzgerald also makes
appearances. _

“One of the things that makes the Zoo so’ 5‘
effective is the show of unity,” Jedlicka said.
“When you wear the shirt, you become a part
of something. You’re saying, ‘I go to Pitt. I’m a
part of the Oakland Zoo. That’s me in my seat
jumping around on TV all of the time.’” 1

WRESTLING

ment to win the EWL title.

The good news for Wilps is that Honeyc-
utt, along with the two other wrestlers who
ﬁnished ahead of him, graduated and won’t be
returning next year. The stakes will be high for
the 197-pounder as he might very well be the
top—ranked wrestler in his weight class heading

n into the 2012-2013 season.

Along with Wilps and Tasser, Pitt returns
NCAA qualiﬁers Zanetta and Mack at 125 and
133 pounds, respectively. Travis Shaffer and
Tyler Wilps also return for the Panthers look-
ing to build on their ﬁrst year in the starting 10
for Stottlemyer.

Senior Donnie Tasser will look to book his
second trip to the NCAA Tournament after
advancing in his sophomore season but nar-
rowly missing out this past season. ,

After maintaining their status in the top 10
of the national polls for much of last season,

_ }?itt’s wrestlers want work hard to improve upon

their weaknesses.

“Every oﬁlseason you want to focus on the
weaknesses you had during the season,” Donnie
Tasser said. “This year, I’m deﬁnitely going to
be working on my top position and tightening
up the rest of my skills.”

Mack said he also has a speciﬁc focus — mat

W1 cadhlga Ht: WUI‘K€(l 011 it the Iasttwo Sl1l'I'lII'l€I‘S ‘

and wants to continue to improve in that area.

“The past couple of off-seasons Fvejustbeen
trying to develop my mat wrestling,” Mack
said. “That’s what I’m going to focus on this

 

off-season, too.”

Zanetta has been taking abroad attack to
improve his wrestling ability.

“I’ve been working on every aspect of wres-
tling,” Zanetta said. “This off—season Iwant to
focus on my strength training and wrestling
skill set.”

As a team, the Panthers have set lofty goals
for themselves the past few seasons and met
them. This year will be no different, although
the team’s competition might be.

Because of Pitt’s decision last year to begin
the process of transitioning from the Big East
to the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Panthers
aren’t sure which conference they’ll be wres-
tling in. But they do know thatwinninga confer-
ence title remains their primary focus.

“We are still shootingfora league champion-
ship no matter what conference we are in, as
well as working to qualify all 10 of our weight
classes to NCAAs and keeping our top—10 rank-
ing,” Donnie Tasser said. ._

Mack has even higher goals as he returns
for his junior season.

“Our team goals for next year are [to be] a
top—ﬁve team in the country, [to have] 10 na-
tional qualiﬁers, multiple All—Americans and
winning another conference title,” Mack said.
“My personal goals are to get back to NCAAs
and become an All-American.” _ 3 9 _

* Accordingto Zanettagthe teamiwants to do
more than just achieve a high ranking.

“We want to be dominant,” he said.

enjoyed a winning season since 1992. To put
thelosing streak into perspective, the tea1n’s
19 consecutive losing seasons mean that very
few incoming Pitt freshmen were alive the last
time the Pirates won more games than they
lost in a season. '

But at least Pittsburghers can reminisce
about the Pirates’ proud history prior to 1992.

The team has won ﬁve World Series titles in
its history, including a championship in 1960
thanks to a game—seven walk-off home run by
Bill Mazeroski against the heavily favorited New
York Yankees. That home run, which remains
arguably the best moment in Pittsburgh sports
history, took place on Pitt’s campus at the since-
demolished Forbes Field. The home plate from
Forbes Field is subtly embedded in the ground
ﬂoor of Posvar Hall. Every Oct. 13, Pirates fans
gather there and listen to a recorded broadcast
of that game.

Despite all of their losing, the Pirates do have
a few things going for them.

A PNC Park, which sis adjacent to Heinz Field
on the North Side, is one of the best ballparks in
baseball and is amust—see for anyone newto the
city. The team also ﬁnally appears to be headed

ing a talented group of young players;

Although the team is a long way from com- ‘

petingfor championships just yet, manager Clint
Hurdle believes he can helpthe Pirates regain
their proud history in time.

“How do you eat an elephant? One bit at a
time,” he said at his introductory press confer-
ence before the 2011 season.

Pittsburgh Power

The newest team to join the Pittsburgh sports
scene is the Pittsburgh Power.

The Power is currently in the middle of its
second season as a member of the Arena Foot-
ball League, which plays a faster, higher—scoring
brand of football.

The Power share the Consol Energy Center
with the Penguins, and with Steelers season still
afew months away, fan support remains respect-
able for the team as Pittsburghers ﬂock toward
what is notoriously the city’s favorite sport.

Former Steelers wide receiver and NFL Hall
of Famer Lynn Swarm is a co—owner of the team,
and he believes the team ﬁts perfectly with the
city’s sports environment. V

“In western Pennsylvania we have a football-
rich environment,”-The said. “This kind oflove of
football provided a real opportunity for arena
football to be successful in Pittsbur .”

In the AFL, the rules are designed to produce
as much excitement as possible. With the ﬁeld
only 50 yards long, an eight player—per-play
limit and wide receivers given a running start on
each snap, arena football frequently sees games
with double ortriple the number of points of the

OTHER SPORTS

Women’s Gymnastics

Keeping up with Pitt’s recent stellar per-
formances by underclassmen, current sopho-
more Haley Bodenheimer had an impressive
2011-2012 season that culminated in an NCAA
Regional Championship appearance.

Bodenheimer was named Rookie of the
Year in Pitt’s conference — the East Atlantic
Gymnastics League —— and has three more
years to compete for the blue and gold at the
Fitzgerald Field House. ‘

For Bodenheimer, the accolade was unex-
pected but appreciated.

“Coming into this year, I never thought

I would be Rookie of the Year, but I did my
best and was rewarded,” Bodenheimer said.
“It is one of the best feelings I have ever had.”

After the squad’s ﬁfch—place ﬁnish at the
conference championships in March, Pitt’s
head coach Debbie Yohman, who has 25 years
of coaching experience at Pitt under her belt,
knows that her team will strive to perform at
an even higher level next season.

“We ended the 2011-2012 year with a
season-high team score, and you can’t end
better than that,” Yohman said. “Next year,
we can work hard and move our way up that
podium.”

Current junior Taylor Washington earned 21
singles victories in her second season and led

With the majority of the squad returning
next year, head coach George Dieffenbach
is conﬁdent that his team will be ready to-
compete and improve.

“The Panthers battle until the last ball is
hit,” Dieffenbach said. “We will learn from our
successes this season and we look forward to
competing at our best in the ﬁxture.” I

“Mike Shanahan and I were talking about
‘that, because that’s what we came in as — a
pro—style offense,” receiver Devin Street said.
“There’s a lot of familiarity with it and a lot of the
same concepts,just different terminologies. The
concepts are great, and they get our guys open.”

When Holley returns from his injury, he’ll
be re—entering arguably Pitt’s most talented

waedefensive position grouping on the ﬁeld at the

two safety slots. -

Following a great junior campaign, Holley
will be accompanied in the defensive second-
ary by juniorjason Hendricks, senior Andrew
Taglianetti and transfer Ray Vinopal, who im-
pressed both coaching staffs with his will to
work at practice. 

_ Vinopal said he was happy to ﬁnally put the
pads on and hit — as Coach Graham didn’t al-
low the practice squad to hit —— and the safety
was relegated to that squad because the NCAA
requires players to sit out a year after transfer-

 He transferred from Michigan.

 

“It’s always an awesome feeling going out
and knocking some heads around for the ﬁrst
day,” Vinopal said. “Last year, I played on the
scout team and didn’t get to go full speed as
much, and it was awesome just to cut loose for
the ﬁrst time in a while.”

The new defensivestyle has.Taglianetti ex-
cited, because the safeties are now allowed to
come closer to the line of scrimmage and work

on stopping the run instead of staying back and

focusing solely on defending the pass.

A “The thingl like about it is the safeties get
really involved, especially with the run,” Ta-
glianetti said. “A lot of times we’re down in the
box. Compared to last year, there were times
when Iwas 15 or 20 yards deep and it seemed
like I was out of the play a little bit. Now we’re
pretty much considered a linebacker. It’s a lot
more exciting, and I really think this scheme is
going to do good things for us.”

With summer camp still in the ﬁxture, Chryst
knows that if these guys keep working hard, he
will have a difﬁcult decision regarding which
two safeties to start. Until then, he’sjusthoping
they keep making it a tough decision for the
ﬁrst-year head coach.

“I think you keep playing, and that would
be great if thatwas the problem,” Chryst said.
“They need to keep going. The real competition
is within yourself, and are you being the best
player you can be. The other stuff will work out.
If you’re a good football player and you can do it
consistently, then youwillplayalot of football.”

That statement can apply to every position,
as Chryst looks to get the best 11 players on
the ﬁeld on each side of the ball. He said every
starting position is yet to be determined, and he
has challenged his players to earn their spots.

“The great thing about sports is that in ev-
ery game you have to prove yourself, and every
year you have to prove yourself,” Chryst said.
“We can all make a pretty good bet on some
spots and'who should start. The great thing
is they still have to—go out and do it. There is
nothing more important than this team and
Pitt football, and I talked to the group about
that. If you’re true to that, then your best 11
players shouldn’t sit out.” I A 1

BASKETBALL

So have faith — the men’s team will re-
bound and likely it will happen immediately.
Because of Pitt’s internal growth and poten-
tial big—time additions and the competition’s
loss of experience and talent, the 2012-2013
season should be more like what Panther
fans have grown accustomed to over the past
decade.

As for the women, there is nowhere to go
but up-in the coming years.

The tearn’s struggles have increased annu-
ally since the 2008-2009 season in which the

Panthers, led by Shavonte Zellous, reached '

the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA Tournament.
Pitt’s win totals have decreased from 16 to
14 to eight in the three seasons since that
2009 run.

But, with a team that incredibly will not
have any seniors for a second consecutive

season, the Panthers are making progress‘

toward returning to national prominence.
Rising sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel

1 led a talented freshman class last season,

and her successful ﬁrst year didn’t go un-
noticed, as the conference named her the Big
East Freshman of the Year. Kiesel led Pitt in
points and assists per game at 13.6 and 2.8
points, respectively.

In addition to Kiesel, junior guards Ashlee “ ‘

Anderson and Marquel ’Davis provided a
scoring punch for the team. Anderson ﬁn-
ished second on the team in scoring at 10.6
points per game, while Davis ﬁnished third

at 8.5 points per game.

Exactly how much the Panthers improve 4‘

next season could rest on the shoulders of a
girl taller than Michaeljordan.

Marvadene “Bubbles” Anderson, a 6—foot—
11 recruit from Newjersey who is presumably

the world’s tallest teenage girl, will bring :

plenty ofheight and attention to the Panthers

this season, and her success on the court , 1
will go hand-in—hand with Pitt’s ability to }

pick up wins.

Anderson will be joined in the Pitt front— -

1 court by junior Kyra Dunn, who ﬁnished sec-

ond on the team in rebounding at 5.6 per
game and averaged ﬁve points per game.

Junior Abby Dowd also provides a long— l »

range threat to stretch the defense. She made , V

a team—high 35 3—pointers last year, includ-

ing seven in a 23-point performance against ’ ‘

DePau1in_]anuary —— a game in which Dowd
tied the school record for 3—pointers made
in a game. I, . ~

With a young, talented group of players
continuing to improve under ninth-year head
coach Agnus Berenato, the strategy for the
Panthers is to stay on course and get better
with every game. ‘ ‘ ~

And if Bubbles can dunk a few times along 

the way, it could be a fun season for Pitt fans
watching the rebuilding women’s basketball
team.

‘ ‘Overall, prospects for hoth,.teams,lo.ok.,

bright. So go ahead, purchase those Oakland
Zoo shirts and make sure you ﬁgure out the
ticket-requesting process. The seasons to
come look to be worth following. . if
