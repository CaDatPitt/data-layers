Syndicated columnist Tony Brown
called on blacks to stop blaming their
problems on white racism and start taking

pride in themselves. Brown spoke last

night in the William Pitt Union as part of
Black Week, sponsored by the Black
Action Society.

“You have a wisdom. Preserve it. Simply
strive to be yourself, and let the pieces
fall in place,” Brown said.

It doesn’t help blacks to constantly talk
about white racism because “if you don’t
know we’re oppressed, you’re in the
wrong country,” he said.

He called upon members of the black
intelligentsia and middle class to become
role models for their black lower—class
counterparts. .

Education and affirmative action will

help blacks achieve economic equality, ‘

he said.

Brown compared affirmative action to
an NBA basketball draft, saying the worst
team always gets the first draft pick.

“If we do not practice affirmative
action ... our league will become weaker,”
he said.

The black middle class can help the
lower class by supporting black

businesses, according to Brown. He
pointed out that blacks currently spend
95 percent of their income within the
white community.

He urged the students in the audience
to compete with their white classmates
for good jobs and told them to “major in
one thing — graduation.”

Brown said blacks will only be equal
when they are economically equal to
whites, regardless of the number of civil-
rights bills passed.

“Civil rights without economic rights is
no rights,” he said. Providing jobs for
black people will stabilize the black
community, making it “safe and
free.”

Brown created the Buy Freedom 900
Network, a telephone network that
connects buyers with businesses,
professionals, churches and community
organizations.

Proceeds from the calls go toward
providing loans to start and expand
businesses, which will in turn provide
much-needed jobs, he said.

He told the crowd to ignore the labeling
of the black community as a minority
because “if you believe you belong to a
minority, you will act like a minority. Let
the world see us for who we are. They
can handle it.”

sex assaults
‘just rumors’

rnorial Hall

Although rumors are circulating
about sexual assaults on campus
over the weekend, Pitt Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary
Moses said none were reported
to campus or city police.

“They’re just rumors, and we’re
trying to trace the rumors,” he
said. No “rapes, indecent assaults
or exposures” were reported to
the public safety department
over the weekend, according to
Moses.

Detectivejames McCarthy from .

the Pittsburgh Police sexual-
assault squad said the last assault
reported to the city police
occurred on Nov. 5. No assaults
were reported over the weekend,
he said.

On Nov. 5, a female Pitt student
was forced at gunpoint to leave
Forbes Quad for Mazeroski Field,
where she was sexually assault-
ed. The assailant threatened to
shoot her if she moved, and then
he fled toward the Frick Fine Arts
Building.

Moses said campus police are
still investigating the Nov. 5
incident, and more information
should be available “maybe
toward the end of the week or
next week.”

One thing can be said for our
government: There is a lot of
paperwork. Processing
government information is the
responsibility of thousands of
bureaucrats in local, state and
federal offices. If you ever want
to know what information the
government has about you or
some other topic, you can find
out by using the Freedom of
Information Act. '

Congress passed the Freedom
of Information Act in 1966, and
the act was modified in 1974 and
1986. It’s a wonderful legislative
action. Outside of the ‘nine
restrictions and Privacy Act
exemptions on information,
anyone can access government
documents of the U.S. executive
branch.

Under the executive branch
are the Departments of Health
and Human Services (i.e., Social
Security), the Justice Department
(i.e., the FBI), the Department of

 

Defense, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and other
agencies. This legislation only
covers federal legislation. Many
states, including Pennsylvania,
have similar right-to-know
legislation. A
Question:Whattypeofreeords
can I access?

Answer: As mentioned, each
agency must make certain
information available to the public
— the information published in
the Federal Register. You can
only access your own records.
The Privacy Act, adopted in 1974,
prevents you from acquiring
someone else’s records. The FOIA
guarantees “upon any request for
records” that the agency will make
records available promptly.

Q: How do I make a request?
A: Write a letter to the agency. It's
that simple. You should address
it to the individual in charge of
the agency identified in the
Government Organizational
Manual, which can be found in
the library.

Q: Does it cost to have copies

A: In most cases, yes. There is a
charge for the search and for
photocopying. In most cases the
average cost is about $15,
according to the American Civil
Liberties Union. But in some
cases, the costs have been
thousands of dollars. Fees can be
reduced at the agency’s
discretion.

Q: What are the exemptions?

Student Government Board

2 » . ’ THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Tuesday, November 12, 1991
Gain access to government documents in your spare time

A: The governmentdoes not need
to allow access to all information.
If you want to challenge restriction
on files, administrative appeals
exist. It is also possible to
challenge a block in federal court.
Exemptions prevent access to
properly classiﬁed information.
This is probably the most
contested area of the legislation.
One exemption prevents the
dissemination of law-enforcement
files, when disclosure would
interfere with an investigation,
reveal a confidential source or
hamper a fair trial.
Q; How about a sample letter?
A: The following is adapted from
Your Right To Privacy, published
by the American Civil Liberties
Union. Begin with the salutation.
In the body of the letter, refer to
the Freedom of Information Act
(5 U.S.C. 552a). Specify what you
want.You can request all doc-
uments aboutyourself. Ask for an
explanation if a file is restricted. If
you feel the request is in the
public interest, you can ask for
the fee to be waived or reduced.

Q&A: New ROTC professor discusses future of the Army 

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Lt. Col. Michael Cassetori joined
Pitt Army ROTC this fall, replacing
Lt. Col. Michael Geoghagan, who
is now a training officer for the
ROTC Cadet Command.

Cassetori, the professor of
military science, oversees the
training for the Panther battalion
and expects to be at Pitt for the
entire four years of his assignment.

Cassetori comes to Pitt after
working with the ROTC battalion
at the University of Scranton and
serving as an air defense staff
officer for three years in Belgium
at the Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers Europe.

In a conversation with T be Pitt
News, Cassetori commented on
his experiences in the military,
the future of the Army and the
controversy about ROTC on
campus.

The Pitt News: How do you see
the role of the Army as
changing in the next few
years?
Lt. Col. Michael Cassetori: It’s
getting smaller  If you look
through history, you see that after
a lot of conflicts the Army has
gotten smaller. And sometimes
it’s good — it saves money ——
and sometimes it’s not. Sometimes
we pare ourselves down so far
that when we have to react to
other situations, we have difficulty
in doing‘ so. And that’s where you
end up relying on the Reserves
and National Guard maybe more
so than you would want to  But
it looks like we’re going to be
losing a minimum of 25 percent
of our forces by 1995  The Army
will take the brunt of that.
PN: What types of changes do
you want to make in the ROTC
program?
MC: When I first came in here,
one of the things I told the cadre
[other officers] was that I do not
want to make any changes initially
because I wanted to take a little
time to observe where the
battalion was at.

The battalion has a very

excellent reputation  When the
cadets go through evaluations,
they do very, very well. With that
kind of a track record, why do
you need some new guy coming
in to go ahead and change
everything? [.,.l

One of the things I want to do
is continue the efforts we ’ve made
toward recruiting more nurses in
ROTC. We’ve done very, very
well so far. The Army needs nurses
desperately, and here at Pitt
there’s a large population of
[nurses]. We are able to offer
many _incentives, such as
scholarships, that I think are
beneficial to them 
PN: If you had the power to
make certain changes at the
University at Pittsburgh, what
abouttheuniversitythatneeds
to be worked on?
MC: 1 don’t have any power
whatsoever'—
PN: But if you did. It’s a
hypothetical question.
MC: I just don’t think I’ve been
here long enough to properly
assess where we’re at  I’ll tell
you one thing we could do is go
ahead and increase the amount
of parking we have. That’s tough.
My goodness, it’s expensive.
PN: The university Senate
Council recommended that
the ROTC be discontinued in
1997 if the Department of
Defense doesn’t change its
policy Prohibiting homo-
sexuals from participating in
the military. What are your
feelings about the recom-
mendation? .
MC:‘[...] What people have to

realize is that [the people in the .

armed forces] did not make that
policy. We are obligated to adhere
to that policy because it is a DOD
policy. We just do not have any
latitude of implementing our own
policy. There has been a lot of
discussion on this particular issue
 And I really think, that just as
we have seen tremendous
changes in the world in the past
year or so  I think you’re going

to see some changes on this issue

also. T hat’s just my personal
opinion, but I just think that it’s

was probably also the most

a lot of difficulty seeing where we
had made a lot of progress. We
were making many short—term
‘gains, but the long—term gains,
the responsibility of them to work
on their own air defense, we just
didn’t see any progress.
PN: What role did you have in
advising the Kuwaiti air force?

force for the HAWK "missile

how to operate and deploy the

.  Professors attribute Thornburgh loss to .‘ poor planning’

By Gary Knapick
smﬁwnm

Poor planning by Republican Dick
Thornburgh’s campaign staff was partly
responsible for Thornburgh’s loss to
incumbent Democrat Sen. Harris Wofford

 5, lastweek,accordingtoPittpoliticalscience
, and communications faculty members.

“Thornburgh thought he had a birthright
to the position,” said Jon Hurwitz, an

~57 _ associate professor of political science.

“He took a lot of things for granted."
Hurwitz criticized Thornburgh’s
“smugness” and said Thornburgh should

 have spent more time campaigning on a
‘I local level. Thornburgh’s deficiency in the

area of grass-roots politics was evidenced
by _an absence of pro-Thornburgh lawn
signs during the Senate race.

A The election was characterized by “anti-
incumbent, anti-Washington” feelings

I A’ . ’, among the electorate, according to Hu rwitz.

He said Wofford was able to portray

According to Ted Windt, an associate
professor of communications, there are
four elements to any campaign: candidates,
organization, money and issues.

“Harris Wofford appeared to be running
for Senate, but Thornburgh appeared to
be running for governor," Windt said.
“Thornbu rgh was talking jobs, but jobs are
a state issue. Talking national health care
is addressing a program,” Windt said.

Wofford’s campaign was more organized
than Thornburgh’s, according to Windt.
“He used the old campaign that Casey
used in his gubernatorial races. They had
one hell of an organization.

“For the first time in my memory, a
Democrat had the funds to wage the kind
of campaign we see in modern elections,”
Windt said.

One aspect of the modern campaign is
the televised mud—slinging that left voters
confused and analysts puzzled. “When
you run a negative campaign, which both
sides did in this election, you create a lot

THE PI'I'l' NEWS, Tuesday, November 12, 1991

Windt, who claims he predicted that
Wofford would win by a five to 10 point
margin, said the large number of undecided
voters in pre-election polls made it difficult
to accurately project the outcome of the
race.

“Negative ads were used to make people ‘

who are leaning» one way or another to
think twice about the way they’re leaning,”
Windt said. In the end, “an overwhelming
majority” of the undecided electorate sided
with Wofford. Wofford defeated
Thornburgh by a 12-point margin.
Through negative campaigning
“Thornburgh made the mistake of making
Wofford’s name a household word,”
Hurwitz said. “If you’re running against an

unknown, you want to keep him that _

way.”

“When you get an issue that strikes a
chord with the electorate, people start
talking about ‘that candidate who’s talking
about national health care.’ They’ll learn
his name later,” Windt said.

 

the ’90s,” Windt said.

“National health care was not defined in
terms of policy — it was deﬁned as a goal.
He's promised only to propose it. He can’t
unilaterally implement it,” Windt said.

Windt expressed little doubt over the
workability of a national health-insurance
program.

“You’re damn right it's feasible. If we
can spend $500 billion to bail out the
S&I.s, we can spend whatever is necessary
for the health and well-being of American
citizens,” Windt said.

Windt said the Republicans could learn
much from the Pennsylvania senatorial
race. “In a way, Bush may see this election
as a blessing in disguise,” Windt said.

“The Republicans have gone to great
lengths to establish themselves as the
party of the middle class,” Hurwitz said.

“It’s impossible to win an election without *

that white, middle-class vote. They need
to regain that middle—class advantage.

Clinic alleviates fears of the dentist

By Kim Palmiero
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

C . Do you shudder when you hear

the word “dentist”? Does the
whizzing sound of dental
instruments strike fear in your
heart?

You aren’t alone, according to
Dr. Calvin Pierce, co—founder of
Pitt's Dental Fears Clinic.

“About 70 percent of the
populace has some anxiety about
going to the dentist," Pierce said.
“Five to 12 percent of the
population has some phobia
about going to the dentist.”

The clinic, located in Pitt's
School of Dental Medicine,
attempts to help people confront
and gain control of fears that
might keep them away from the
dentist's office.

The patient first has sessions
with a clinical psychologist, then
goes on for treatment in the clinic's

dental—care facility.

When patients’ fears are so
extreme that they require more
help then a psychologist can give,
enter Dr. Richard Finder or Dr.
Harvey He ntele ff, who administer
“relaxation” drugs to help put the
patient in a calm state of mind.

“Generally we start out with
stronger drugs because we want
the person to be calm and have a
positive first experience,” Finder
said.

“Traditionally speaking, people
with the kind of problems we are
dealing with were rendered
unconscious with drugs, and then
the work was performed on
them,” Finder said. But this
approach is not desirable because
the patient “is just avoiding facing
the problem.”

Pierce stressed that patience is
important. “We are not
judgmental. What we want to do
is develop trust. Whatwe consider

success is when a patient goes
out and finds their own dentist.”

In the past year, according to
Pierce, the Dental Fears Clinic
has treated about 50 patients.
“Everyone is different; some
people’s phobias relate to getting
their teeth cleaned. One patient
I saw could not handle getting X-
rays  We've seen people with
other problems, like panic attacks.
Some just can’t cope with their
environment.”

Finder attributed dental fears
to a historic association of “den-
tistry with pain. Anesthetics were
only given for extraction of teeth,
and this fear have been carried
with us up to the present day.”

Also, “the mouth is a very
important part of the body to us.
It’s our main means of
communication, so the idea of
having this area invaded can be
frightening for some,” Finder said.

The Dental Fears Clinic
admitted its first patient injanuary
1989. The clinic is the only one of
its kind in the Pittsburgh area.

“It seems to have been a domestic problem between people
who knew each other and had too much to drink,” Donham said.

Donham said no disciplinary action has been decided upon
yet. “They will go before the Judicial Board, [which] will hold a
hearing. It depends on how the board or hearing officer reacts.
We will probably make [the non—students involved] persona
non-grata,” Donham said. .

Persona-non-grata status prevents people from using university
facilities, according to Donham.

 Duke of racism

 

 
  

The upcoming election for Louisiana governor is causing
quite a stir not only in the South but also in states that-will
not fall directly under the governor’s legislative auspices.

Running for governor is ex-Ku Klux Klan member and
Nazi sympathizer David Duke, the racist notorious as of

V late for claiming that he's changed his views.

A recent article in The Washington Post begins with an
anecdote of one S. James Hintze from 1969, when he was
then a professor at Louisiana State University. When
asked why he was taking German, Duke, then a student
in Hintze’s class, announced that he wanted to learn
German in order to read the works of the “greatest genius

I 9 who ever lived.”

The greatest genius, according to Duke, was Adolf

_ Hitler.

But that was 1969, and the David Duke of today insists
that he should not be held accountable for the actions and
beliefs he followed while in college.

Sure, maybe some of us would like to forget some part
of our pasts or try to pretend they didn't happen. But how
many of us have slept under a swastika banner or dressed
like a Hitler youth on a regular basis? . _

After organizing the National Association for the
Advancement of White People in the early 80s, Duke
began a newsletter for his neo-Nazi followers. The
newsletter continually overﬂowed with anti-Semitism and
hatred fueled toward Jews and African-Americans.’

It is inconceivable that a man with such warped, twisted,

1 supremacist views could so drastically change in under

eight years. Duke was prominent in the KKK, aggroup
which “lynched helpless black Americans, murdered
civil-rights workers, burned crosses and spread its divisive
venom of prejudice across the land,” said Newsweek
magazine in 1989.

While the Republicans and the White House have
refused to endorse Duke, much of the support Duke has
garnered came from employing the same race politics as
George Bush did with Willie Horton in 1988.

Duke has never been convicted of any crimes. According
to The Washington Post, he even avoided tax-evasion
charges in 1990, when an investigation at the Louisiana
Department of Revenue and Taxation showed that Duke
had not filed state income-tax returns between the years
of 1984 and 1987. After the press released this information,
which may have damaged his election to the Louisiana
State Legislature, Duke willingly paid the overdue taxes.

Should Duke be elected governor at next Saturday's
elections, defeating his democratic opponent, Edwin
Edwards, the residents of Louisiana should justifiably be
very afraid for the well being of their state.

Duke is the epitome of hypocrisy. When interviewed by
Pitt English Professor Patsy Sims for her 1978 book, The
Klan, Duke told her, ‘‘If, indeed, America is headed
toward more, quote, radical, times; if people really feel
threatened, they're not going to want some kind of half-
measure. They're going to want somebody strong.”

True, America does need a strong leader. However
Duke should stop ﬂattering himself. He is not the strong

leader we are looking for. Rather he is a weak worm who
has used George Bush to connive his way into a political
election.

Eliminate Waste disposal plant

Anyone who was outside last
week knew from the intense
autumnal scent of burning leaves
in the air that the forests of West
Virginia were burning. Floating
over hundreds of miles of wooded
mountains, a fine, particulate ash
was waging a relentless (if
temporary) assault on the
olfactory receptors and lungs of
Pennsylvanians.

If Waste Technology Industries
has its way, the next 20 years will
see a new (and far less
benevolent) release of pollution
from a source much closer to
home.

Situated less than 30 miles from
Pittsburgh, East Liverpool, Ohio,
will be the home of the world’s
largest toxic-waste incinerator.

A few facts:

The facility, whose tank farm
alone has the capacity to_ hold
nearly 3 million gallons of
pumpable toxins, is built on the
banks of the Ohio River. The site,
an already contaminated plot
which is leased to WTI by the
Columbiana County Port
Authority, is situated directly
above a fresh—water aquifer.

East Liverpool residents live
less than 300 yards away. East
Elementary School is located 1,100
feet away at a height even with
the top of the smokestack.

The location is in violation of
Ohio’s environmental regulations,
which were revised in 1984. But
WTI’s original siting permit, issued
in 1979, continues to be valid
under what appears to be an
environmental ex-post-facto
loophole.

“Why did WTI choose such a
location,” you may ask? Because
East Liverpool has many poor,
uneducated and unemployed
residents. East Liverpool is
desperate.

Owned by the Swiss company
Von Roll, WTI plans to import
foreign toxic wastes so they can
be burned at the East Liverpool
facility. Realizing that stricter
pollution regulations and public
outcry in Europe mean the days
of European waste incineration
are numbered, Von Roll is simply
taking its business elsewhere.

WTI's buddy-buddy public-

Gary
Knapick

relations campaign, which aims
to turn the locals against outsiders
who protest the facility, is
sickening. W'I'I’s feeble attempt
at blue-collar camaraderie
reminds one of similar techniques
used in beer and pick-up truck
commercials. -

WTI, whose project has the
potential to endanger hundreds
of thousands of lives, has a history
of scientific shiftiness and public
betrayal that should earn the
suspicion of anyone who lives
east of East Liverpool. One WTI
public-relations pamphlet lists a
number of “supporters of waste
incineration." It was later
discovered that most of the
organizations on the list have
never even been contacted by
WTI. ,

The reports of “scientific”

groups who received funds from ,

W'II seem to be little more than

publicity stunts. The report »

conducted by Pitt's Center for
Hazardous Materials Research
basically stated that although WTI
was in violation of all sorts of
environmental regulations and
that it was inadequate in its health-
risk assessment, its toxic-waste
incinerator was perfectly safe.

WTI is not safe.

Perhaps more frightening than
the facility's direct threat to the
citizens of East Liverpool is the
indirect effect that it will have on
people hundreds of miles away.
While WTI’s claims thatno dioxins
will be burned at its facility may
be true, dioxins will, in fact, be
produced. Some of these dioxins
become even more concentrated
when they bioaccumulate in the
food chain. Thousands of
vulnerable farms, wetlands and
lakes will be located under the‘
shadow of W'I’I’s toxic cloud.

A particularly frightening and
relevantexample of this biological
magniﬁcation occurs in dairy
cattle. As these dioxins
bioaccumulate in hay and grains
fed to cows, they can become so

concentrated that drinking one
liter of milk from such a cow is
equivalent to inhaling the
contaminated air next to. the cow
for eight months.

Among the veritable potpourri ,

of emissions that will be belched
out of the incinerator every year
are 9,400 pounds of lead and
2,560 pounds of mercury. As an
East Liverpool resident told me
during my recent visit .to the

town, “Years ago they took the .

lead out of gasoline to keep it out
of the air. This thing is going to
put it back in.”

Mercury that leaves WTI’s.

smokestack in particulate form
has the potential to cause
incredible environmental
calamity.

It takes only 0.3 grams of
mercury to contaminate a 25-
acre lake to the extent that the
ﬁsh will be unfit for human
consumption.

WTI’s toxic waste incinerator is
not an Ohio problem. The town
of East Liverpool is only a few
hundred feet inside the Ohio
border.

While the officials in the Ohio
government and EPA may have
possessed the power to permit
the construction of the facility
and the willingness to reap the
negligible tax and employment
benefits it would ‘deliver, the
winds will spare most Ohio
citizens from paying the real price
of the facility.

Waste incineration is an after-
the-fact solution to a toxic-waste
problem that can only be solved
by working from the source. By
allowing this cheap yet highly
dangerous method of disposal to
continue, we give industry all the
more reason not to look for
alternatives to toxic materials.

-While waste incineration may
put toxic wastes conveniently out
of sight, it cannot put them out of
mind. Little more than a “landﬁll
in the sky," the East Liverpool
incinerator promises only to take
toxic waste from the dnim and
scatter it in partiailate form across
our state.

Back-to-back for Woodstra, volleyball team

By Cory Walborn
Staff Writer

Gaining momentum with each
match, the Pitt volleyball team
has again done what it always
does: Defeat Big East opponents.
With a victory over Villanova the
Panthers secured their second
straight Big East season title and
are headed into the Big East
tournament seeded No. 1.

Pitt went 7-0 this season in the
Big East's second year of round-
robin play.

Duplicating last season’s 7-0
mark, the Panthers have never
lost a Big East match for head
coach Sue Woodstra. Her
undefeated streak dates all the
way back to her first season in
1989.

This dominance has to be
attributed to the players as well
as to Woodstra.

A nucleus of six experienced
seniors has been molded to fit
into Woodstra’s style of play.
This style has left opponents,
especially Big East opponents, a
step behind.

‘‘I feel there is a little more of a
gap between us and the other Big
Eastteams,” Woodstra said. This
gap has allowed the Panthers to
continually win over the past two
seasons.-

This gap extends to the talent
of the players and to the talent of
the coaches, said Villanova’s head
coach, David Barkley.

“They have good athletes and
excellent coaching,” Barkley said
about Pitt’s success in the Big
East. “Their good, experienced
seniors hold their ground and
execute well. They are also a
beautifully coached team.”

Leading the team are senior co-
captains Sue Zonneville and Dee
MacAulay, experienced middle
hitters who have been‘ the
backbone of Pitt’s offensive attack.
Add senior Linda Zols, senior
Heather Hollands and sophomore
Ann Marie Lucanie on the outside,
and the Panthers have a powerful
and consistent all-around game.

But the biggest surprise of all
would have to be the play of first—
year setter Annemarie Mernagh.
Thrown into the fire of starting at
the setter position on the first day
of practice, Mernagh has come
through for the Panthers and looks
to be Pitt’s setter for years to
come. ’

This talent alone has put the
Panthers ahead of the rest.
“Talent-wise we are further away
from the [Big East] teams,”
MacAulay said. “We are still a
step ahead of them, but they are
getting better.”

Marcia Perparos, an outside
hitter for a vastly improved
Villanova team, pointed to Pitt’s
talent and coaching as having
brought about such good results
for Pitt volleyball. “Their talented
seniors have plenty of experience,

Despite losing the past four

Sunday's competition was no exception

the pace of the game with two consecutive

was able to set up for a goal.

Brodows prepares
to take goalie spot

By Jason Billings

As far back as graduating senior Tim Sobelman can remember,
he has played soccer. Now as his col1ege—career clock winds
down, he has helped prepare someone else to fill his goalie
gloves. Kirk Brodows, an academic sophomore in his first year
of eligibility, has inherited Sobelman’s position as goaltender
on the Panther soccer team.

Brodows, ‘19, sees his future in soccer as positive and thanks
Sobelman, 22, for helping him get where he is. At the beginning
of the season, Sobelman said he just wanted to work by himself,
but toward the end of the season he began to work with

“I wanted Kirk to be ready for next year,” he said.

The younger goalie has played soccer “for pretty much my
whole life,” Brodows said. He first sought after a goalie position
because he hated to run.

“I didn't like to run that much, and being a goalie looked like
a lot more fun than running around,” Brodows said. He used
to watch Sobelman and Jay Kapusta play college-level ball.
“Tim has a lot of experience," Brodows said. And that he

Continued from page 7

Sobelman, who began playing
for Pitt in 1987, has almost 14
years playing experience. His
soccer days began when he was
in third grade.

He played the field for a while
and started as goalie on a Mexican
team in Sacramento, Calif., his
hometown.

“Out there [on the west coast],
players’ individual skills are very
high,” Sobelman said. “They play
one-on—one constantly.”

Here on the east coast,
however, the soccer is slower-
paced. Teams tend to play “long
ball,” long crossing patterns and
passes, rather than relying on the
fancy footwork of close, “short
ball” play.

Sobelman helped lead the
Mexican team, Club de Partivo,
to a 12-1-1 record this past
summer.

Sobelman came to Pitt “to make
the team and to travel a bit.” That
he did easily, especially as a
walk—on and a redshirt freshman.
His first year on the team ended
in an injury; his next year, he
lettered. \

“I.was on a cloud,” Sobelman
said, remembering his first start
against Ohio State. He had made
a save on a breakaway and led
the Panthers to a 2-1 victory.
After the game, children asked
him for his autograph.

“I was surprised that I started a
couple of games,” said Brodows,
who now hails from Rochestor,
N.Y. but grew up in Summit, NJ.
He played a lot of different sports
as he grew up before he came to

Q an active part of our birth control choice. Is
there a feminine product which I can easily

éi buy that’s effective?

A A: Good for you! All over the counter
contraceptives are relatively easy to purchase
with little or noembarassment. However, you
should be more concerned with purchasing a
contraceptive method that you will use and feel
comfortable with. That's why a product like
VCF’ Contraceptive Film is a great choice.

Thousands of gynecologists across America have been recommending
VCF Contraceptive Film to their patients. VCF Film comes in the form
of a 2” semitransparent square that is extremely soft, most women say
they can't even feel VCF after it's inserted. VCF is one of the easiest
forms of birth control that you can buy today. All you have to do is
simply fold VCF over and insert like a tampon: VCF begins to dissolve
in a matter of seconds. No need to worry about removing VCF,
because there is nothing to remove. VCF simply washes away
naturally. Each square of VCF contains an effective amount of non-
oxynol 9, the leading spermicide recommended by doctors. SOUNDS

in the “Backyard Brawl” on a
well—deserved goal. Two games
later, he. started again against
Robert Morris College.

“I didn’t come off of the line
enough,” Brodows said.

He misjudged a crucial high
shot that ended in a goal for the
Colonials and a 2-2 tie with Pitt.
His inexperience is something
that he realizes and intends to
work on.

“I plan on lifting more and
gaining a little weight,” Brodows
said. “I pretty much have to build
from scratch and tone everything
up.”

Head coachjoe Luxbacher first
brought Brodows into the game

, to see what he could do. Since

Brodows had never seen any
regulation play, it was a must—see
situation for the Pitt coaches. They
could not go into next season
with a goalie with no playing
time.

“I think I’m a little more vocal
in the backfield. than Tim is,”
Brodows said.

Keeping players on their marks
in a man—to-man defense is a
difficult job, but the goalie has
the best perspective of the field,
he said. Brodows hopes to keep
himself involved during the off-
season.

“I’ll be playing indoor [soccer]
next semester," Brodows said.

Playing the quicker, indoor ball
should sharpen some of his skills
and help set his style.

“I’m conﬁdent with my diving, ”
he said. “I just have to get with
the players and work on my
crosses [from corner kicksl.”

A problem that he faces for
next season, he said, is playing
with a new, inexperienced
defense. . _

“It’s going to be hard to fill in
the holes,” Brodows said. Pitt's
defensive squad loses at least
four of. its players next season.

Sobelman seemed sorry to leave
his acadernicsoccer career but
plans on a job coaching as soon
as possible, he said. He said he
may play for a semipro team in
Sacramento.

Brodows, on the other hand,
has a few years of goaltending to
look forward to.

“In high school, I used to have
a lucky T-shirt,” he said. “Then I
lost a couple of big games when
I was wearing it.” Now Brodows
plans on using his own resources
and those that Sobelman helped
teach him when he starts in goal
next season.

“It’s no fun just sitting there on
the bench,” Brodows said.

Panthers countered with two consecutive goals of their own.
The ﬁrst came ﬁve minutes into play, when Barilla scored his
second unassisted [goal of the evening. Two minutes later
Crousey set Dan Fendor up to net his first goal against CM.

Although the scoring for the second period ended seven
minutes into play, the penalties continued until there was only
two seconds remaining in the period. Twelve penalties were
received during the second period (seven against CM and five
against Pitt).

As in the majority of Pitt’s games the third period was the most
physical of the competition. Only two goals were scored. The
first came from Pitt’s Kip Linse off Barilla and Crousey, and the
second was from CM’s Featherston.

Although there were a mere 12 penalties assessed during the
third period, they amounted to a total of 58 penalty minutes.
Two game disqualiﬁcations were rendered against CM, and a
bench minor was also rendered against CM. ’

is a great coach,” Perparos said.

Coaching is what takes a team
to a higher plateau, whereas talent
can only get a team so far.

That is exactly what Woodstra
has done to Pitt volleyball. She

has taken a wealth of talent and,’

with -her experience and
knowledge, propelled the
Panthers to new heights.

One example was Pitt’s berth
and first-rouhd victory in the
NCAA tournament. That victory
over Ohio State was the Panthers’
only win ever in the NCAA
tournament.

Accomplishing that, Woodstra
showed her ability and made Pitt
a volleyball power in the east as
well as in the nation.

At the beginning of this season
Woodstra admitted that last
season was a big step in the
development of Pitt’s program.

“We need another season like
1990,” she said. “We want to
show everyone that 1990 was not

The Panthers have done this.
They have gone undefeated in
the Big East and are preparing for
the Big East tournament and the
NCAAs.

Pitt’s season has shown that
last year’s achievements were no

Their Big East opponents also

know all too well that the Panthers
are no ﬂuke; they haven’t beaten
Pitt in the past three years.

Pitt’s winning ways have made
its conference foes dread playing
the Panthers.

Woodstra hoped that these
teams would say, “Oh no, not

‘Pitt, ” when they saw the Panthers

these Big East opponents have
learned to say, “Oh no. Pitt has
won another Big East title again.”

offensive success. '

Throwing for 335 yards, Van
Pelt turned in his third-best
passing performance of the
season. Van Pelt connected on 21
out of 34 passes; none were bigger
than the 38-yard touchdown toss
to senior Moore, which put the
Panthers on top 7-0 in the ﬁrst
quarter.

Moore broke down the right
side of the ﬁeld and beat his one-
on-one coverage. Van Pelt reacted
with a sharp pass that Moore
caught just as he was being hit.
However he stayed on his feet
and stumbled into the end-zone.
It was that pass that set the tone
of the game for Van Pelt.

Using a variety of routes, his
receivers spread the defense out
and allowed Van Pelt to pick
apart Rutgers’ defensive
secondary. Van Pelt praised his
receivers for a job well done.

“It was a tremendous effort by
the receivers,” Van Pelt said. “They
caught balls over the middle, but
more importantly you don’t see
any dropped balls.”

Dropping balls is not a frequent
sight when sophomore Chris
Bouyer is around, especially
against Rutgers.

The young ﬂanker caught six
passes for 116 yards and provided
key catches to keep Pitt’s drives
alive. ‘

One ﬁrst-quarter catch was a
spectacular grab in which Bouyer
was sandwiched between two
defenders as he leaped for a high
throw.

Fully extended, _he caught the »

ball and took a monstrous hit, but
he came down with the ball and
kept the Panthers’ offense
marching.

“I played with a lot of
conﬁdence,” Bouyer said. “I was
tired of losing, so I played the
hardest game I could.”

Hackett had high praise for
Bouyer and the rest of the
receiving corps. “I think what
you saw today from the receiving
corps was the future,” Hackett
said. “You saw tough catches
over the middle. That's the catch
you have to make.”

Making that catch is what tight
end Dave Moore is used to. His
reliable catches over the middle
have enabled him to catch 90
passes throughout his career,
placing him 10th on Pitt’s all-
time career-reception list. But
Moore downplayed his personal
records and achievements. He
said, “The record is just statistics.
I’m just happy we won.”

Moore also extended his streak
of consecutive games with a
reception to 20. He has 48
receptions this year and is likely
to have over 500 yards receiving
this year as well.

Against Rutgers, Moore did
what he has done all season. His
consistent hands and his durable
frame made him Van Pelt’s
primary target.

Moore only caught five passes,
but he provided the ﬁrst sign of
life in the Panthers’ offense with
his touchdown reception in the
ﬁrst quarter.

Bringing a fresh sign of life to
the Panthers’ offense was first-
year running back Curtis Martin.

Martin looked sharp, as he

“I thought Curtis did a great job

sealed Rutgers’ fate.

Harris takes advantage of startin

By Bob Maselli
Staﬂ‘ Writer

When Panther left cornerback
Tinker Harris was called on to
start in Saturday’s game against
Rutgers, he was not all that
worried.

Just because Rutgers has a split
end namedjim Guarantano, who
is one of the best in Big East

football, and this game was Harris’
first start of the season, there was
no cause for alarm. Harris didn’t
let these things bother him. He
just went out and strove for one
thing: to make some big plays
and win this game to give the
Panthers a winning season. Harris,
who played all but one series on
defense, was tested almost
immediately by Rutgers’ offense,

led by quarterback Tom Tarver.

Less than two minutes into the
first quarter, with Rutgers on its
own 45-yard line, Tarver dropped
back and released a perfect pass
to Guarantano. Just as Guarantano
pulled the ball in, Harris put a
monstrous hit on the split end,
sending the ball flying for an
incomplete pass. The hit killed
any chance for a first down,

making Rutgers punt. Again in
the first quarter, with the Scarlet
Knights on Pitt’s 14-yard line,
Harris put a touchdown-saving
hit on receiver Chris Brantley.
Two plays later, Rutgers had to
settle for a field goal.

Harris, a 5—foot, 11-inch, 185-
pound sophomore from Willow
Grove, Pa., was again in the right
place at the right time. In the

second quarter, with Rutgers on
the move, Lance Evina caught a
Tarver pass, only to be nailed by
Pitt free safety Lex Perkins. The
hit sent the ball into the air and
into the hands of Harris for the
fumble recovery. This gave Harris
his first fumble recovery of his
college football career.

“[Harris] has come on all year
long for us, and he got the start
for us today. lt’s hard to believe
he’s a sophomore by the way he
played for us today,” said Pitt
head coach Paul Hackett after the
Panthers’ 22-17 victory. “He got

I burned today a few times, but he

learned how to play against a
first-class receiver. He will be
starting forus at cornerback in
the next two years.”

Harris said he agreed with
Hackett’s comments. “I took mine.
I made some stupid mistakes and
missed some assignments and
even dropped what could have
been an interception, but I was
focused on what I had to do, and
it felt good to get the start,” Harris
said. “I was honored to be going
against a receiver ‘such as
Guarantano, but I was ready for
it. Every day in practice I go
against our receivers, and they
are the best in, the country. I was
ready.

“I didn’t get nervous out there
too much,” Harris added. “Steve
[Israel] helps me outthere, and
he won’t let me get nervous. He
kept pushing me, and he always
does, and he got me ready for the
game.”

Hard economic times
hurt graduate chances
of finding employment

By Katie Kaminski
FbrIbePﬂtNbws

Upon successful completion
four or more years of higher
education, the class of '92 will
have reason to celebrate.
However, they will also have
reason to worry; finding a job is
becoming increasingly difficult
in today’s hard economic times.

The current job market is bleak,
according to professor Mark
Perlman of the economics
department, and chances are it
will not be much better by spring.

With an October unemploy-
ment rate of 6.9% and the number
of college graduates entering the
labor force slightly higher than
the number of job openings
requiring four or more years of
higher education, many graduates
will not be able to enter the
occupation of their choice.

Professor Perlman offers his
own suggestions for finding that
first job. He stresses the

importance of graduates knowing '

how to express themselves
effectively both verbally and in
writing. “The sad truth is that
many cannot do either,” according
to Perlman.

A certain degree of ingenuity is
also needed, Perlman says. Many
graduates wait for what they
consider to be a respectable job.
‘‘It is hard to get a job when none
are offered, ‘when none are
offered in your area, look for
other opportunities. Should a
college graduate take a job in a
hospital with a largeturnover or
as a bagger in a grocery store?”
asks Perlman,” Neither is what
the graduate thought he spent all
of his money for. But, they should

get acquainted with the hospital,
it is more beneficial. “ Taking any
job to acquire valuable skills and
then using it as a "resume builder
is preferable to having no job.

Robert Perkoski, Interim
Director of the Career Placement
Center, says seniors should get
an early start and be “fairly
aggressive “_when looking for a
job. They should also diversify
their job-hunting strategies. In
addition to applying for advertised
job openings, soliciting
employment by telephone and
sending resumes to companies
without published ads can also
be effective.

The Career Placement Center,
located on the second ﬂoor of the
student union is also helpful when
looking for a job. Career c
ounselors in the Placement Center
have information on the current
job market and can help job-
searchers identify the areas in
which they can best use their
skills.

Perkoski says training in
writing effective resumes is
available as well as interview
coaching. Company represent-
atives are brought to Pitt through
the Career Placement Center
giving students opportunities to
interview on campus.

The placement center services
are free to all University of
Pittsburgh students and graduates.

Although a college degree will
no longer guarantee a graduate a
good job, Perkoski and Perlman
agree that college graduates do
have a significantly higher
earnings potential and a lesser
chance of experiencing
unemployment than those
without college degrees.
