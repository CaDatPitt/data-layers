This is the first of a series dis-
cus-sin.g the work of Pitt’s medical
research team.) ’

=3: * 5.: ’

1 By GEORGE L. SALIIVI
The prediction that Pitts-

burgh would become one of’

the world’s primary medical

A centers has been brought clos-

-er to realizations with Pitt’s
Dr.'Jonas E. Salk’s recent an-
nouncement of an effective
polio vaccine. ‘

This disclosure was the high

' ,point of a series of announcements

in which plans for the expansion
_of Pitt’s medical center, Dr. Wil-
_liam McDowell I-Iammon’s progress
‘intthe use of gammaglobulin, and

-Dr. Salk’~s additional development .
.'of -a new—ﬂu vaccine were featured.

The importance _ of Dr. iSalk’s
polio research is emphasized by
the nation’s reaction to his new
vaccine. The medical profession
and the National Foundation for
Infantile Paralysis are -very op-

timistic about the potential cure.

Hopes -are high that the Pitt re-
.se'archer’s vaccine is the answer to
m.ankin;d’s ﬁght against polio and

~ 1i_ts_—paralytic aftermath.

' Anonymity to .Fame_

Dr. Salk, at the young ageof 38,
has crossed the threshold of fame
and, successwith many years of
achievement ahead. Virtually un-
known to the public a few weeks
ago, today he is big news. Pub-
licity and reknown are his for the
-asking,‘but one of his main wishes
is to remain out of the limelight

‘so that. he can have time; time to j.

Jonas‘E. Salk entered college at

the age of 15, in a prei-medical
course at City College of New,
York. Hisinterest in research de-
layed his education -in 1935 when
he postponed his medical studies
at New York University College of

.Medicine to accept a fellowship in

chemistry. , V .

, A year later he resumed his
studies at NYU graduating in 1939.
-He was good enough to merit three
in ore fellowships in ' medical
school: the Christian A. " Herter
Fellowship in Chemistry,‘ the
Christian A. Herter Fellowship in
Experimental Surgery, and. a fel-
lowship in bacteriology.
Dr. Salk‘; married to Donna

‘Lindsay, is the father of three

boys: ‘ Peter aged nine, Darrell
aged six, and Jonathan aged three.
This, in part, explains his desire

to grow up in.

~ 11% 1947, Dr. Salk came to»Pitt as
a research grantee of the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.
The March. of Dimes outﬁt recog-
nized his ability in doing the pains-
takingly careful work needed in
polio research, and demonstrated

their faith in his progress by re-
cently giving the _ University a
blank check with which to carry
on the polio research work.

Described ‘by the people who
know him personally as a “human
dynamo,” work schedules -of. 16
hours a day, six days .a week‘ are
not‘ unknown to him. He is the ‘ﬁrst

Endless hours were spent correlat-
his ﬁndings with the results pro-
duced by. other researchers, isolat-

performing countless trial-and-

lM Setup OGr;ows 
With Uphill Push

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

 

In April 1949, Athletic Director Tom I__-Iamilton took Pitt
off its diet. He wasted no time increasing the formula—-
since his action meant a rejuvenation of the _1ntercolleg1ate
program and the birth of a giant-sizeintramural setup.
Actually the intramural program could grow only if

' the intercollegiate facilities expanded. So with that reason-

ing behind the minds at work, Pitt ** 
began to grow. \ 7 ,~
Captain Hamilton» engineered I
the big. business and his~_ﬁrst mate, F,
Leo Bemis, began to build the $3‘

1, '
{'3-) ’ <

     

    
  
 
    

 
 

   

In ’49 Hamilton had this

‘to say:‘ “The athletic problem

at present seems to be getting

“ﬁéld- space. As we get more

facilities We’ll add to the var-
‘ sity and intramural program.” ‘

Schenley Oval and Ellsworth‘ Field were added to the setup

1 imediately and right behind Hamilton’s varsity teams trotted Bemis

and his intramurals. . .
In that year enrollment was at its peak. And the AIM ‘program
also reached its peak with 3760 participants ﬂooding scattered ball
ﬁelds. Hamilton and Bemis accomplished the rare feat of building
a top-ﬂight program by ignoring geographical barriers.
V Unlike most schools Pitt doesn’t have a centralized campus
and keeping the student body interested in a cross town setup

-1

The" Athletic Department realized this cold fact and only last

.'week‘Hamilton announced that Pitt athletes—varsity and intramural

-—will get a new home.

Theeproperty set aside by the. Urban Redevelopment Authority
probably won’t be availab_l'e before 1957 because of both legal and
ﬁnancial reasons. But the campaign to centralize Pitt’s athletic plant
has ‘been blueprinted. 

A “Itwas an uphill battle to _pull away fromthe lower campus
« into a centralized area,” Bemis said, "and all the while we were
eompetingagainst so many. outside, interests.”
iTh‘e' ﬁrst, move in this direction was the Field House building
WhiCh\ houses most of the varsity athletics. As a result, the varsity

teams" abandoned the Stadium pavilion and Bemis took over. ,

Now the _in_tramural program continues‘ to grow despite a‘ drop

‘in enrollment. Last year 19‘ activities comprised -the program with

4700 participants. Bemis reveals that these ﬁgures are quite high
considering that most campus schools with a similar enrollment have
trouble interesting their studentbody. V ,

I Since 1946 the IM program has increased over 400 per cent.

‘In that year only seven sports were listed on the program and a

scant 1600 participated. « '
' One thing is certain, though, Pitt students won’t have to
wait much longer for that hilltop country club.

Even though they lost nine let-

the Panthers will have to get sec-
ond and third places at these posi-
tions to hoperfor an’ upset.

In tomorrovs/"’s meet, the Pan-
thers will have even tougher op-
position. In, addition to Big Ten
schools Michigan, Michigan State,
and Northwestern, deﬁnite entries
include Baldwin Wallace -and

Shuttle Hurdlﬁs Hope

Pitt will be entered in almost all
the events but the Blue—and-
Go1d’s chief hope is in the shuttle
hurdle relay team of Wally -Mon-

and Don Kennedy.

‘As far as the mile relay squad,
Olson is still uncertain of the ex-

will not know whether Giron can

This will be the first season that

will be in the 120-yard ‘high,

Tomorrow, the Panthers move on to Columbus to meet
