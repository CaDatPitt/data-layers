Ford stresses
eﬁcit reduction

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

The nation’s federal deficit prob-
lem must be faced and resolved in
order to avert an economic catas-
trophe, former President Gerald R.
Ford said last night at Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall. i

“If we solve the problem of the
federal deficit,” Ford said, “we will
have a healthy economy for the next
five years.”

Ford said that the Reagan admin-

istration should be able to work out
a cohesive plan with Congress
because there are no outside forces
dictating government policy.
‘ As president from August 1974 to
January 1977, Ford encountered oil
price increases that limited his eco-
nomic policies when he was
president.

He outlined his program to reduce
the federal deficit. His first point
includes reducing the growth rate of
transfer payments and installments.

Transfer payments and instal-
lments represent approximately 40
percent of the national budget and
they include social security benefits,
food stamps and government pen-
sions.

Ford's second point entailed ter-
minating social programs formed in
the 1960s whichare not needed in
today's society.

Ford’s third point to solve the
budget problem involved stretching
out President Reagan's proposed
defense budget. Reagan wants to
spend $700 billion on defense during
a five-year program. Ford suggested
stretching the program over six or
seven years. He said that eve-
ryone in society is effected by the
federal deficit.

“Everybody — older people, peo-
ple in business, people in the aca-
demic world and especially students
have a stake in whether we have a
healthy economy,” he said. “Oppor-
tunities to stay in school are

“Opportunities to stay
in school are enhanced
‘by a healthy economy.
Job opportunities when
you get out of school are
enhanced by a healthy
economy. We must solve
the problem of the fed-
eral deficit.” ’

enhanced ‘by a healthy economy.
Job opportunities when you get out
of school are enhanced by a healthy
economy. We must solve the prob-
lem of the federal deficit.”

Pitt’s Ted Windt, an associate
professor of political rhetoric,
believes that Ford’s discussion of the

deficit was timely because the prob-'

lem needs to be solved.

“The deficit really scares me,”

Windt said. “It can have disastrous,

effects on the future.”

Ford also discussed the upcoming
summit between President Reagan
and Soviet leader ‘Mikhail Gorba-
chev. He stressed the importance of
conducting hard-nosed negotiations
with the new Soviet leader.

“Gorbachev represents a totally
new generation of Soviet leader-
ship,” he said. “He’s a very articulate
person. He is smoother and slicker

than an ailing [Leonid] Breschnev or ‘

[Yurie] Andropov. And he’s more
dangerous.

“I firmly believe to help our allies,
militarily and economically, and I
think we have a lot more responsibil-
ity to help the underdeveloped

_ countries.”

Second transplant center approved despite criticism  

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Despite strong opposition from
Presbyterian University Hospital,
the Health Systems Agency
approved Allegheny General Hospi-
tal’s request for a second kidney
transplant center in the city of Pitts-
burgh on Thursday.

Presbyterian Hospital, whose.

transplant center‘ has received
worldwide acclaim in its 10 years of
operation, was against the new cen-
ter when the request was first consid-
ered and then denied by the HSA in
August. At the time, the main oppo-
sition centered on the cost of each
transplant and the question of the
ethics of using living relatives as kid-
ney donors. Since then, the issues
have not changed.

“We’ve stated our case before,”
said Presbyterian Hospital spokes-

wouldn’t be proper to rehash old
arguments now. We respect the deci-
sion and will have to abide by it.”

In August, Presbyterian Hospital
reported that the average cost of a
transplant was $25,000. Allegheny
General’s figure was $36,000. This
$11,000 difference was considered
too high at the time and was one
reason for the HSA’s refusal of the
new center. Allegheny General Hos-
pital has disputed the validity of the
figures.

“In the first meeting, Presbyterian

« Hospital wouldn’t give out their first

cost data for kidney transplants,” a
spokesman for Allegheny General

* said. ‘_‘So we gave the HSA what we

thought it would take to perform a
transplant on average. Our ﬁgures
turned out to be too high and the
figures Presbyteriangave were too
low, and at the [HSA] meeting last
week, the cost difference was practi-

Another argument against
Allegheny General’s center is that it
might unnecessarily hurt the pro-
gram already in place. However,
Allegheny General believes this con-
cern is unfounded.

“It was a business concern,” said

‘ the spokesman for Allegheny Gen-

eral. “Presbyterian was concerned
that people would go to our hospital
instead of their facility, and they
would lose business.”

“We believe that there is enough
of a market to sustain both
hospitals.”

The statistics reveal‘ that there is a
market large enough to provide
enough kidney transplants for both
hospitals. Right now there is a wait-

ing list of nearly two years for those‘

patients needing kidney transplants.

_ Allegheny General hopes to alleviate

the wait somewhat.

able to significantly decrease the
waiting list,” said the spokesman for
Allegheny General. “But we should
be able to narrow the‘ gap.”

A final argument that Presbyteri-
an Hospital presented was the ques-
tion of using living relatives as
kidney donors. Presbyterian Hospi-
tal only uses cadaverous donors.
The last living relative donor trans-
plant was done in 1982, and they
have only used ll since 1977.
Allegheny General plans to utilize
living relative donors extensively in

. its center.

“We plan to only use about 10
percent living relative donors the
first year," said the spokesman. “But
within a year of our first year of.
operation, we should be up to 25

percent. And we feel strongly that ‘

we can approach 50 percent of living
relative” donors in the future." The

nationwide average of living relative

donors is 25 percent.
“There is some medical concern

and a minimal risk for both parties” ,
involved,” said the source. “But the ,

benefits far outweigh the risks, and
we want to give the people of Pitts-
burgh an option as to which way.
they want to go.”

The transplant center is not a cer-

tainty yet, however. The request still
must go to the State Board of Health

for final consideration, and. Tom 

Chakurda said all arguments will be
reserved until that time.

“Now it goes to the state,” he said,‘
“and we’ll see what happens there.”

Allegheny General feels conﬁdent
that'their center will pass the final
test. ,

“It is very unusual for the state to
.turn down a request," said the
spokesman. “If everything goes. as
planned, we hope to start sometime

Intelligence agents arrested inGreenpeace scandal

PARIS (UPI) — The growing
scandal in the French government
regarding the sinking of a Green-
peace ship in a New Zealand harbor
continues. The French secret service
arrested two of its own officers last
night for leaking information to
news organizations. It was the
French daily Le
Monde which last week obtained
information pertaining to high-level
government involvement in the sab-
otage action and subsequent cover-
up during a recent investigation. The
Paris government is facing mount-
ing criticism from the French media
and charges that authorities de-
stroyed key evidence to avoid
incrimination.

Prices rise,
inﬂation drops?

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The
government reports consumer prices
in August increased 0.2 percent for
the fourth consecutive month. With
the slight increase in the consumer
price index — the same as recorded
in May, June and July — the annual

inﬂation rate through August stood
at 3.3 percent. If the year ends with
the same low rate, 1985 will produce
the lowest inﬂation ratesince 1972.
Most of August's increases stem
from higher housing costs.
Separately, the Census Bureau
said yesterday that orders for so-
called “big-ticket" durable goods
rose 3.4 percent in August. How-
ever, the entire gain is attributable to
defense and aircraft industries; the
gain would have been 2.5 percent
without defense orders, and there
would have been no gain if aircraft
orders are also discounted.

Hurricanes

mainland. At 9 a.m. (EDT) yester-
day, the storm was still well out in
the Atlantic, about 825 miles east-
southeast of Miami, moving west-
northwest at I5-mph. Tropical

storm Henri,’ meanwhile, continues

losing strength as it moves up the

petition
Su p re me Court

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The
anti-nuclear group Three Mile
Island Alert, lnc., yesterday sought
a Supreme Court injunction to halt
the restarting of an undamaged reac-
tor at Three Mile Island. The appeal
comes one day before the scheduled
restarting. T-M-I Alert asked Jus-
tice William Brennan to continue a

halt order due to expire at 4 p.m. .

today in hopes of gaininga full hear-

ing on the issue. In its petition to the
Supreme Court, T-M-I Alert
charged that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission did not follow estab-
lished procedure in authorizing the
restart. Justice Brennan may grant
the stay, refuse the request or refer
the matter to the full court. Gover-
nor Dick Thornburgh, who pre-
viously opposed the restart, has not
yet made a decision on the new
appeal. The reactor has not been
operated since its twin was damaged
in a partial meltdown in March
1979. —

LOS ANGELES (UPI) — The
Los Angeles Times said yesterday
that a Cleveland mob figure has
accused Mafia clans in Chicago,
Ohio and New York of being instru-
mental in the selection of Teamsters

Angelo Lonardo, an informant now

serving a life sentence on drug and
conspiracy charges, said organized
crime families also had a hand in
naming the man preceding Presser,
Roy Williams.

Nutrasweet scare

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Con-
sumer groups opposed to use of the
artificial sweetener aspartame have
lost their case before federal appeals
court. The court ruled in Washing-
ton that the government followed
proper procedures in giving appro-
val to its use. Aspartame is marketed
as Nutrasweet and is rapidly replac-
ing sacch_ariri as a low-calorie sugar
substitute. Questions about its
safety have centered on reports of
alleged severe headaches, brain
damage and harm to fetuses of preg-

Scandal in France

The overall public response to the Greenpeace affair
has been quite disturbing. Sadly, the public has exhibited
little more than a morbid curiosity into the'scandal,
' ‘hungering rabidly for further disclosures of the involve-
ment of high-level French officials. However, calls for
justice have been quite muted and infrequent. The New
York Times (Tues., Sept. 24) reports that the French
people “seem to accept [this act] as an unfortunate neces-

I _ sity to protect the national interest”— namely, the testing

I For the most part, the public seems to have failed to
appreciate the heinous nature of the crime committed by
some members of the French government. It has been
admitted by French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius that
the bombing of the Greenpeace vessel was undertaken by
the French intelligence agents in response to orders from
the French government. As a result of this act of state
terrorism, a man has been murdered.

_ The admission of governmental approval would seem
,to imply the involvement and, therefore, the moral culpa-
fbility of a good number of French government officials.

Fact or Dogma

Could the people at the Coinci-
dence Bureau be working overtime
again? In the September 20 edition
of The Pitt News, a letter about a
run-in with members of Lyndon
LaRouche’s “Conspiracy Theory of
the Month Club" was followed by a
letter containing a conspiracy
theory!

If the Rev. Robert White wants to
believe that the military uses the
ROTC program to -“[militarize_]
American higher education” instead
of to recruit college-educated offi-
cers, that‘s his right. He also has the
right to blame the high cost of edu-
cation on ROTC when, in fact,

can meet it, is what’s causing tuition
increases; after all, what can we

higher value on faith than on rea-

son? (If this is not the case, I‘ll apol-

ogize —— but I’ll also suggest that
Rev. White find an occupation more
suitable to a person who prefers fact
to dogma.)

Rev. White has these rights and
more, including the right to forget
that if it weren’t for the strong mil-
itary posture he obviously doesn’t
want our country to have, he
wouldn’t have any rights at all!

‘Star Wars’ Good Strategy For (1.8.

The American public has suc-
cumbed to the temptation of believ-
ing that Moscow approaches arms
control in much the same manner as
the United States. They have failed
to realize that there is a fundamental
difference between the strategic doc-
trine of the Soviet Union and that of
the United States.

The Soviets conceive nuclear wea-
pons very differently from the way in
which Americans do. Rather than
basing deterrence on something
resembling assured destruction, the
Soviets argue that deterrence is
maintained by their ability to ﬁght
and to win a nuclear war — if deter-
rence should fail. The United States,
however, maintains that deterrence
of central nuclear war is achieved
through a credible threat of catas-
trophic damage — more commonly
mutual assured
destruction.

The Soviet Union emphasizes
counterforce targeting (targeting of
an adversary's missiles), pre-emptive
attacks, close integration general
purpose forces and nuclear forces, as
well as civil defense.

This victory-oriented approach to
deterrence commits the Soviet
armed forces to a combination of
offensive and defensive operations,
in order to allow them to survive -
and prevail — in any conflict. This is
fundamentally different from the
U.S. approach of strategic deter-
rence; that is the threat to punish any
aggressor by devastating its urban-

J

industrial bases (countervalue tar-
geting, as opposed to counterforce
targeting) with retaliatory strikes.

It is essential that we remain sensi-
tive to this present dilemma; that is,
two nations approaching a common
problem from two different pos-
tures. We should ask ourselves,
therefore, that if the United States
attempts to develop a defensive wea-
pons system, which could theoreti-
cally counteract a Soviet capacity
for first strike, might it not have the
effect of forcing an adversary — who
believes that nuclear war is “winna-
ble” — to re-examine his adherence
to a warfighting interpretation of
deterrence? Reagan's expected
announcement that he would not
allow the Strategic Defense Initia-
tive program to become a point of
negotiation in US-USSR arms talks
would not, therefore, lead us to
believe that his is an inﬂexible atti-
tude which would halt real progress
in containing the arms race. On the
contrary, the administration’s reluc-,
tance to use SDI as a bargaining
chip could in fact have the reverse
effect — that of containing the arms
race.

If it appeared that the Soviet
victory-oriented view of nuclear war
was no longer realistic in light of the
U.S. attempt todevelop a defensive
system, would the present expansion
of arms continue? Perhaps this
expansion would be halted and the
insistence upon a war-fighting doc-
trine would be muted and trans-

formed into a more defensively
oriented approach compatible with
U.S. expectations of strategic deter-
rence. The benefits of this forced
introspection are at best unpredicta-
ble, but the possibility ofa softening
of the Soviet Union’s “war-fighting”
stance —— at any level of intensity —
seems to be worth the risk.

I do not believe that a ballistic
missile defense, which could protect
American and allied populations
with tolerably low leak rates, is a
realistic possibility. The effects,
however, of such research do have
potential positive benefits by forcing
the Soviets tore-analyze their insis-
tence to rely on an aggressive war-
fighting approach to nuclear, war.

Ironically, the Soviets are more
optimistic about the success of such
a program than the United States. In
fact, the much-publicized space
defense research helped persuade
the Soviet Union to resume arms-
reduction talks. Gromyko persists,
however, in claiming that once the
SDI is abandoned, “the possibility
will be open for a reduction, even a
drastic reduction of strategic wea-
pons and medium-range nuclear
arms." ( Washington Post, March I,
I985). This statement hides, per-
haps, the reality behind the rhetoric
that Gromyko is worried about the
U.S. potential to neutralize Soviet
first strike capabilities, thus forcing
the acquiesence of a» nation so
devoted to a war-fighting aggressive
approach to nuclear war.

Paralysis in the Face of Growing Deficit

Logic seems to have taken a

2 powder here in the United States.

Take, for instance, the current
mild panic over the trade deficit.
When I left the country nearly three

I weeks ago, this was only a potential

issue. When I returned, it had
achieved such importance that it not
only had made the cover ofthe news-
magazines, but the president himself
was paying attention. As with South
Africa, he was trying to figure out a
way to stop Congress from taking
some meaningful action.

You may ask why, after years of
massive trade deficits, everyone IS
suddenly so concerned about the
problem. After all, the country has
been running a deficit for a decade
now, and the gap has been widening
so that this year it may reach an

estimated $150 billion. You would
think that the administration would
by now have a plan to" deal with it,
and in a sense it does. It will continue
doing what it has been doing and
hope the deficit goes away.

With the exception of some scat-
tered supply-siders who, like theo-
retical communists, are waiting for
their theory to be applied in its pur-
est form, there is almost no one who
does not think that the trade deficit
is tied to the federal budget deficit.
The latter, a $200 billion annual mis-
take, contributes to the overvalued
dollar which in turn makes Ameri-
can goods non-competitive abroad.

And yet, the administration and a
lobotomized Congress does nothing
about the budget deficit. Congress
tried in the last session, trimming the

budget by about $50 billion, only to
learn after recess that it made almost
no difference. The fact is that the
government is starved for funds. It
cannot keep the defense industry
rolling in. dough and at the same
time keep taxes where Reagan put
them with his 198] tax cut. The
obvious answer is to raise taxes, but
a popular president won’t permit it.

The trade deficit / budget deficit
package is not the only area in which
presidential obstinancy stands
between the problem and a solution.
Somewhat the same situation ap-
plies in the field of arms control,
where only the president thinks that
his Strategic Defense Initiative (Star
Wars), no matter what its true merits
may be, can result in the elimination

By David Zafris

’ Staff Writer

When he stepped off the plane,
Fletcher McNeill was unprepared.

 He didn’t expect to see soldiers
ﬁt‘ marching at the airport, military
 ‘vehicles swirling around the termi-

nals, and armed guards at every
gate. He had stepped into a night-

'-j}‘_ mare. He was in El Salvador.

McNeill is a high school teacher in

 the Pittsburgh area, and part of a

delegation of teachers invited to El
Salvador by the University of El Sal-
vador. McNeill, who has worked in
Central American Solidarity organi-

‘ zations for the last four years, was

i‘ briefed in a day long meeting in

- Washington, D.C., before leaving

for El Salvador. However, when he

 saw the multitude of U.S.-backed

military in El Salvador, he was over-

f , come with emotion. Emotions, he
1" said, that he canft even begin to
 _explain.

“There is no escape from the mil-

 .itary,” McNeill said. “You walk

down the street, you see it. We sit in
our hotel room, the national guard
watches us. There are police.
Whether it’s riﬂes, machetes, it’s
everywhere. Nothing can prepare
you for that."

The United States supports the

ill right-wing government in El Salva-
I7’ dor headed by President Napolean

Duarte. The U.S. has given military
aid to this government exceeding

 $500 million dollars, despite many
’ » reports of human rights violations
1“ by government forces.

 

 

 

McNeill spoke to unions, the U.S.
Enibassy, human rights groups, pol-
itical prisoners, and refugees
throughout El Salvador, and he

i; ” heard many accounts of atrocities

committed by the military.

“Nobody ever said that an Ameri-
can tortured them,” he said. “How-
ever, we have heard many times that
there was an American in the same
room, giving instructions on how to
torture.”

McNeill was impressed by the
heroism and the strength ofthe Sal-
vadorian people. “They bomb their
towns. They destroy their crops.
Despite everything the government
does to repress them they come
back. The people will win,” he said.

McNeill described a typical
bombing raid. “The U.S.-sponsored
army is dropping napalm. They
claim it’s to burn the foliage, but the
reality is to burn the village and get
as many people out ofit as they can,”
he said. “They come in then with the

helicopters and they shoot at ran-
dom. Most people at that time are in
the bomb shelters, or dead.”
“Then the third thing they do is
' they come in on foot,” he continued.
“And what they do is generally
round up the people either for
recruitment in the army, or if they
think they’re FMLN members they
sort of disappear into prisons

throughout the country, or -they,

round them up into refugee camps.”

The -FMLN (Farabiindo Marti
Front for National Liberation), is
the main guerilla movement group
fighting against the government in
El Salvador. The bombing raids are
aimed at crippling the FMLN, but
the bombs often hit hospitals,
_towns, schools and churches,
according to McNeill. McNeill

heard one account from a woman
claiming she heard voices speaking
English on a foot patrol after a
bombing raid.

“For _those who don’t think the
United States is involved in this war,
we have one woman ‘saying she

McNeill said. O

McNeill feels that ‘Duarte is a

assesses
(1.8. policy

By Nadia Moritz
Features Editor

“The free market emerges from
the barrel ofa gun. Military suprem-
acy is the instrument for creating
economic superiority,” said James
Petras, professor of political science
at the State University of New York,
Binghamton, and internationally
recognized authority on Latin
American problems.

Petras’ address Friday night was
part of a Pitt conference on “Central
America and the Crisis of U.S. Pol-
icy,” held Friday and Saturday and
sponsored by the Central American
Mobilization Coalition in
Pittsburgh.

The issue was understanding U.S.
military intervention in Central
America. Petras, who has years of
travel and research experience in
Central America and admittedly
favors the creation of socialism,
explained the issue in terms of the
regional conﬂict in Central America
and Washington’s global
aspirations.

“Petras represents a certain per-
spective on the left," said Petras’
friend, Pitt history professor Harold
Sims. “He is an independent leftist.
He knows the system, but he is not
affiliated with any party, so his view
is unique.”

Analyzing _the deep ‘structural
links that the United- States has
developed to the global economy
and the importance of the imperial
state in sustaining those links, Petras
explained the revival of U.S. militar-
ism on a global scale, of interven-
tionism in the Third World and of

Central America

continued from page 6
bipartisan congressional support for
these endeavors.

“The basic problem that con-
fronted Carter, and later Reagan,
liberals and conservatives alike, was
that there was emerging an enor-
mous gap between the growth of
overseas U.S. financial and invest-
ment capital, and declining support
for state intervention,” said Petras.
“In the mid-19705, the banks were
everywhere; the army was nowhere.”

According to Petras, Carter used
the hostage crisis to mobilize public
support to justify defense spending.
Reagan multiplied these efforts
while bringing them in line with glo-
bal economic interests and increased
intervention policies in the Third
World.

“Anti-communism was repro-
grammed by Carter and amplified
by Reagan as a way of eroding the
pervasive anti-interventionism and
anti-militarism which remained as
powerful residual elements in the
public consciousness,” Petras said.

Central America was the region
chosen by Washington to demon-
strate its global military program.

According to/Petras, the revolu-
tionary confrontation in Central
America is rooted in the economic
expansion of the ’50s and ’60s when
“economic growth from above and
the outside led to a sharper polariza-
tion of classes which found expres-
sion in the revolutionary
movements in the l970s, highlighted
by the upheavals in Nicaragua and
Grenada and the radicalization of
mass politics throughout most of the
region.” ‘

The expansion of commercial
agriculture in Central America led
to the displacement of small
farmers, dispossessed peasants,
unemployed urban youth and ex-
ploited manufacturing workers, and
they flocked to radical social

movements.

The reaction to these revolution-
ary social movements, as Petras
explained, was a strategy adopted by-
the Reagan administration that re-
versed" the revolution of the first

“The people I talked
to are angry. They are
angry at Duarte, and
angry at the United
States.”

Fletcher McNeill
Pittsburgh participant

Teachers invited to El

Salvador

wave (Nicaragua, Grenada), des-
troyed the social movements in the
second wave, and built the military
power throughout the region to con-
tain future movements.

“The essence of Reagan’s policy
was militarization of political life

.and the subordination of every

human and political consideration
to the achievement of these three
overriding priorities,” said Petras.
“Washington is already involved in
an undeclared war with Nicaragua
that only lacks front-line troops."

Petras explained the most striking
feature of Reagan’s policy in Central
America as the disproportion
between the “massive commitment
of U.S. state capital [military and
economic aid] and the massive out-
flow of local and U.S. private
capital.”

“The enormity of the U.S. com-
mitment to Central America is indic-

ative of the extremes to which

Washington is willing to go,” said
Petras.

Such extremes, according to
Petras, include $500 million to El
Salvador alone, a willingness to vio-
late World Court and international
law, open support of Contra terror-
ism against the Nicaraguanstate,
and a willingness to support and
provide aid for the mass terrorist
regimes in El Salvador and
Guatemala. .

“Clearly, this level of commitment
demonstrates that Washington is

driven by more than a desire to
retain regional inﬂuence and control
over local economies," said Petras.

Central America, according to
Petras, has been chosen by the Rea-
gan administration to demonstrate
the projecting military power works.
The costs and sacrifices and viola-
tions are necessary to achieve the
supreme good, the defeat ofcommu-
nism. A military defeat would ques-
tion the military expenditures that
are presently justified as part of the
anti-communist crusade. ‘

The unwillingness of Congress to
oppose a president with high opin-
ion ratings, according to Petras, is
another enforcement ofthe ad minis-
tration's interventionism and
increases the threat of world war.

“Nuclear weapons may be manu-
factured and ‘stationed in Europe
but the detonators are located in the
Third World," said Petras. “Central
America can become the fuse to
ignite the rising nuclear
confrontation.”

In the meantime, military expen-
ditures to El Salvador exceed $500
million and support to the first
democratic regime in history with
45,000 human rights victims con-
tinues, Petras asserted, and the

situation in Guatemala continues,"

where mass killings of Indians have
created theconditions for controlled
electoral processes that provide legi-
timacy to unfair regimes.

“Washington’s militarization of
the region cannot prevent people
from expressing their growing disaf-
fection with free market econom-
ics,” said Petras. “Nor can their
client regimes formulate any pro-
grams capable of ameliorating the
conditions that can ignite future
revolutions in the region.

“And as the costs (if U.S. involve-
ment mount, the political conse-

quences domestically will sound the

death knell of the Reagan adminis-
tration —— and whichever Democrat
or Republican follows his imperial
path.”

With a new ﬂag line of silks being
added to the Pitt band.’s composi-
tion, a ‘larger, diversity of music
styles, a spicier routine and a new
director to implement it all, the band
is on its way to new heights. The new
band director is O’Neill Sanford and
since he was hired July 1, he has been
making his presence felt.

When David Hower resigned last
spring after 13 years as Pitt’s band
director, an intensive country-wide
search was launched to find a suita-
ble replacement. The search com_-,
mittee — consisting of band alumni,
band members and a number of

applications before finally offering
the position to Sanford. .

“Sanford was offered the position
because he was the best qualified
candidate available,” Pitt athletic
director Edward E. Bozik said.
‘Bozik also said that with the
appointment‘ of Sanford, he hopes
“to put a band on the field that is one
of quality and representative of
Pitt's excellence.”

Sanford plans to improve the Pitt.

marching band by developing‘ pro-
grams that will highlight the band as

a precision unit. The addition of the ‘

silk line indicates a more stylistic
half—time show.

Building great music programs‘

seem to be no problem for Sanford,

University of Min.nesota’s band pro-
gram into one of the finest in the
country. During his nine years at
Minnesota, he revitaliied the band
programs in several areas, including
taking the band on tours through
Spain, Mexico and Great Britain.

The Pitt band, however, will
travel only to West Virginia and
Annapolis this year. Sanford hopes,
though, that he will have the proper
funding and resources to take the
band abroad within the next five
years.

Sanford is known for his show-
manship style, which combines pre-

‘cision marching and innovative

patterning. While at Minnesota,
Sanford wrote nearly all of the’

the government in El Salvador used
to beat certain political prisoners
severely, cut off some of their body
parts, and" leave them“ lying in the-

I980.

The student program requires 12
hours of work per week and a com-
pleted interview. The liver trans-
Dlants usually are performed during
the hours of «ll _p.m. to 12 noon, but
these hours vary according to when
a donor is found, as does the student
program hour requirements.

The clinical work in the operating
room involves: taking blood sam-
ples, operating various types of
equipment’ and analyzing the data
from the operating equipment. Basic
research duties involve lab wo_rk in
analyzing plasma extracts and expo-

sure to animal research.

According to Lisa Martin, the co-
captain of the student team, the pro-
gram‘s value comes from the type of
students that are involved. “We have
an excellent program," says- Martin.
“Our staff members provide an
enriched teaching and learning
atmosphere, but-I feel that the real
reason our program excels is
because of the quality of our stu-
dents. They are motivated, dedi-
cated and very eager to learn.”

“Now it's much more sophisti-
cated,” he said. “They are trying to
make it look like human rights are
improving in that country. So
instead they burn them. Or they
drop them in the ocean.”

Even though McNeill never trav-
elled within the FMLN controlled

upset with their government.

“I’m coming back and I’m telling
you the reality as I’ve seen it, and the
reality of what the people want,”
McNeill said. “I didn’t talk to every
single Salvadorian but the people .1
talked to are angry. They are_angry

Pitt defensive coordinator
Bob J unko yesterday denied alle-
gations that he was involved in
the alleged slush fund created for
Texas Christian University foot-
ball players.

6 “The way the allegations are,

Jyou know, the way it was inthe
paper, I was not familiar with it,"
said Junko following Pitt’s late
afternoon practice session on
Tuesday. “I was familiar with
recruiting those youngsters, and
what they said in the paper was
the truth,” added Junko, “but
how this happened, and how it
got blown out of proportion is
beyond me."

The whole ordeal began last
week when TCU head coach Jim

Player payoffs

W Junko denies TCU allegations

Wacker suspended six players,
including star running back Ken-
neth Davis, after revealing that
they had received cash payments
from alumni. According to an
article in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette yesterday, a .T CU boos-
ter, Morris “Snake” Bailey,
contended he was told by other
football boosters that Junko was
included in the process of getting

- money to the players. Such a

fund is a direct violation of
NCAA rules.

This all occurred while Junko H
was defensive coordinator at the
Southwest Conference school.
He coached there for six years
under then head coach F.A. Dry.

According to an article that

-appeared in the Fort Worth Star-

Telegram, Bailey said, “I wanted
to come to Fort Worth and have
a news conference and tell every-
thing: that F.A. Dry and Junko

started the whole thing at TCU,
you can put that in the
headlines.”

An NCAA investigation into
the matter was put into effect
yesterday.

Pitt is currently in preparation
for its matchup with arch’ rival
West Virginia on Saturday. Pitt
head coach Foge Fazio was
objective about the whole
situation.

“It's an allegation,”said Fazio.
“I’ve talked to Bob, and I believe
him.” Fazio added, “There seems
to be a lot of conflicting finger
pointing going on. That’s
between TCU, the NCAA and
the Southwest'Conference. I’m
notfree to judge anybody. I’m
just worried about West
Virginia.”

A,native of Washington, PA,
Junko has been an assistant at
Pitt since 1983.

The Pitt News — September 25, 1985

By Alan Abraham
For The Pitt News

The mighty lumber company of
the l970s has used up its stock and
now seems to be going out of busi-
ness. These once-proud Bucs have
plundered into a sea of red ink. The
team is for sale and nobody in Pitts-
burgh wants to buy it — for any-
thing more than a marked-down
bargain rate.

Three Rivers Stadium has become
a morgue. You can see it in the
mournful faces of the few who
choose to attend what has turned
out to be a season-long burial cere-
mony. These are grim ﬁgures for
division-title contenders as recently
as I983 and world champions just

>4i?x years ago. The odds are stacked.

the Bucs hold true to form, they
have a very good chance of going
over the centennial mark —- in
losses, no doubt- '

Murphy's law has been delivered
weekly to 300 Stadium Circle this
year. The Pirates have won three

straight games only once this year.
They have a league-low 4.01 ERA
and a team batting‘ average of
around .240. All this, coupled with
the current attendance pace that is
expected to reach only 800,000, will
surely make the sea of ink rise to
ﬂood stage.

Fortunately for the ‘Bucs, they’re

I in the hands of the ever-optimistic

Chuck Tanner, a subscriber to
patience. “You don't look at this as a
tough year,” Tanner said brightly.
“You look at it as a year when you
have to re-group. We’re a young
team, just a couple of players away
from a contender. We could be there
by ‘87.”

Of course, the Bucs could be any-
where by 1987 — Tampa, Denver or
Washington,_D.C., to name a few.

From the outside, this organiza-

tion seems bleak. But enter Gate A, ‘

see the Bucs. Talk to the Bucs. All
the statistics, calculations of future
distresses and drug assumptions can
now leave your mind.

 

Pirate manager Chuck Tanner

-Chaz Pa!la/ The Pitt News

looks for his young talentsto lead to a strong future.

 

“You have to put the negative
things out ofyour mind,” said young
pitcher Jim Winn". “We have to cor-
rect the little things, like moving a
guy up a base or hitting the cutoff
man on a throw. There is definitelya
new attitude on this team. At the
beginning of the year the older play-
ers [Madlock, Hendrick, Holland
and Candelaria] had their own set
attitudes and the younger players
had their own. It's deﬁnitely a better
situation now.” A

After taking a few more swings in
the batting cage, he went on:
“There’s a lot of nice people in this
organization. I'm glad I‘m part of it.
I like playing for Chuck. He’s always
positive, always has something nice
to say, and he’s very knowledgeable
of baseball.”

Johnny Ray, the sleek-fielding
second baseman of the Bucs,’
couldn’t agree more. “The players
with bad attitudes have been weeded
out; now we have a new attitude.
We’re hustling moreand enjoying
the game.”

You could see these Bucs were a
new team. They were all accounted
for on the stadium floor, not in the
clubhouse watching MTV, which
Jim Morrison said was taken out of
the clubhouse because “it was taking
away from other things. It wasn’t my
decision. We mutually agreed to it."

Morrison could also see the new
attitude. “These guys are hustling
more and playing better ball," he
said. “For me it’s excitingto get a
chance’ to play and prove myself.”
Which he has done on various occa-
sions this year.

Los Angeles newcomer Sid Bream
is “enjoying the new atmosphere. In
Los Angeles, I was sitting on the
bench. I’d rather be contributing.“

Which is understandable, but
what about a pennant race? “I've
been through the races beforeand
they're exciting, but I wasn’t play-
ing,“ Bream said. “These guys all

have a positive outlook, and I'm

enjoying it here.“

There's a city just a few hundred
miles to the north of the Pirate
organization. Junior Ortiz spent
some time in that northern team

.
\.v.

  Sports

Pirates put lostseason behind, look to future

known as the New York Mets.
“When I was there, the players were
the same type that we have on the
Pirates now. The Mets had a bunch
of young guys who were talented [as
do the Pirates]. They acquired Keith
Hernandez and Gary Carter, and
now they’re one of the better teams
in baseball.”

Could Junior be implying that
this disastrous Pirate season may

‘I have some light at the end? A start of

a new team, such as the Mets who, at
last look, were winning more than
their share of baseball games? “Yes,
this team is very similar to the Mets
of a few years ago. I think that we’re
on the right track to a successful
future."

Within the stadium, there are
some 55,000 seats occupied only by a
seat number. This will turn out to be
one of the larger crowds of the week,
just under 5,000. How do the players
feel? As Larry McWilliams put it,
“The people don't want to be caught
in traffic an hour after the game.
Three Rivers is really difficult to get
in a-nd out of. They only have to do it
once a week for Steeler games. Don’t
get me wrong, though, I like Pitts-

- burgh. lt’s a good organization. I

like what Joe Brown has done. If he
stays on next year, we’ll be OK."

Ah, yes, Joe Brown, who has
returned as general manager after a
nine-year hiatus, talked of the
Pirates: “At the beginning of the
year, this team had no vitality or
exuberance."

There was dissension, however,
and Brown brought out the Ortho
weed killer and proceeded to “weed
out,” as Johnny Ray said, a few
undesirable players, or whatever
comes to mind when you think of
George Hendrick (Mr. Hustle) and
John Candelaria (Mr Closed-
Mouth). Al Holland and Bill Mad-
lock followed the same escape route.
Brown could best describe these
players as “disturbing influences."

Over by the batting cage was Frat-
tere. Lanny Frattere, the most
informed and articulate Pirate
announcer, finds no trouble in being
motivated - during these painful
_ games in which the Bucs find differ-

Page 11'

ent ways to lose. “I’ve wanted to be

an announcer since I was eight years ’

old. I have no trouble with motiva-
tion. I bounced around in the minor

leagues for many years, and my.

dream was to come up to the
majors.” When talking about the
bad image that the Pirates seem to
have, F rattere gave this explanation:

“The Steelers have 45 players, ‘

where as the Pirates have 25. Right
off the bat, the Steelers have a
number edge to circulate around.

A Also, during the course of a baseball

season, a player may have six or
seven nights off and he would like to
spend it with his family, whereas a
football player usually has every
night off during the season and

they’re able to have more free time.” A

After avoiding a batted baseball,
he gave a quick look up at the press
box and added, “You know, this
team has a newness to it. It's young
and fresh; there’s definitely a good
feeling around the team." Which is
true, but will the Bucs get a chance to

‘develop this newness in the confines
of Three Rivers next year? Without
hesitation Frattere said, “We’ll defi-
nitely be here next year. There's too
much tradition in Pirate baseball

not to preserve baseball in this city. .

We have the fans, but they don’t
come to the park for many reasons.
It’s up to us to bring the fans back to
the ballpark."

Bream, Brown, Khalifa, Orsulak,
Gonzalez, Wynne, Ray, _Pena and
Winn — who are these guys? These
are the Pirates of the-future. Yes,
these Bucs have a positive outlook.
Hustle, enthusiasm, and a love of
baseball are all qualities of this new
team. Although the outside may
look bleak, one should realize that
all is not lost. There's a light at the
end of the tunnel, and these young
Bucs are somewhere in the middle of
that major league tunnel. As many
of us have witnessed this year, a few
wrong turns can lead to a nasty sea

of red ink. But take note: A new type _

of boat rower has appeared — a type
that has a willingness to lead a half-

sunken Pirate ship into the light that —

shined on Pirate baseball during
I979. '

Athleteof the Week   

Page 12

Brian Davis

This week’s Pitt News Athlete of
the Week is freshman tailback Brian
Davis. Last week against Boston
College, Davis saw his first action as
a Pitt Panther and gained I00 yards
rushing on 15 carries. Davis filled in
very adeptly when starting tailback
Charles Gladman left the game in
the third quarter with a rib injury.

“I thought Brian Davis played
very well,” said Pitt head coach F oge
Fazio after the game. “We said all
along that he was a great prospect.”

Davis was the Parade magazine
Co-player of the Year last year fol-
lowing his senior year at Washing-
ton High School. He rushed for
l,600 yards during that senior year
and finished his high school career
with 4,478 total yards rushing. That
was the 10th best ever in Pennsylva-
nia high school football history.

His I00-yard performance in his
first outing was the spark behind
Pitt’s second-half comeback against
Boston College. The last Pitt run-

' ning back to eclipse the 100 yard

game.

1

mark in his first game was a guy by
the name of Tony Dorsett. Ironi-
cally, it was the same Dorsett that
Davis was compared to time and
again while in high school.

Boston College head coach Jack
Bicknell got nothing but headaches
from Davis and the Pitt running

“We could not stop Pitt," said a
disgusted Bicknell. “I thought Glad-
man was terrific, then they bring in
Davis. I didn't realize Davis was that
big.”

Bicknell’s All-America nose
tackle, Mike Ruth, added: “They’ve
got one heck of a running back.
[Davis] never stopped hustling. I’m
sure he’ll be heard from again in the
very near future.”

The future is now. Davis may be
the focal point of the Pitt offense this
Saturday when they travelto Mor-
gantown to play the West Virginia
Mountaineers. Fazio reported that
Gladman’s injury was worse than
originally expected, so Davis mav be

Brian Davis

penciled in at the tailback spot.

Some people say that there will
never be another Tony Dorsett, but
there may never be another Brian
Davis either.

Eunch returns to Lady Panthers’ attack

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

Playing six teams of high caliber
in one weekend is tough. Add an
injury-diminished roster, and you
won’t expect the team to win. The
Lady Panthers were forced to play
seven grueling games under these
conditions this past weekend. How-
ever, they rose to the challenge and
returned home with a string of seven
straight victories. The wins over
Dinceion (9-15, 15-10, 15-12, 15-7),
Akron (I5-3, 15-12. 15-10), Big East
rival Providence (16-14, 15-10, 6-15,
15-6) , Temple (9-15, 15-8, 15-4, 15-
7) and the championship victory
over Princeton gave Pitt the Temple
tournament title. A

Although the team was lacking‘

starter Kris Wexell (out because of a
knee injury) and Sally Gillespie
(who had a‘ med school exam), those
slots were filled quitepimpressively
with some underclassmen. Sopho-
more (Tennessee) transfer Lisa

lniuI1Lrer1Qr_t

Stewart had an excellent weekend.
Coach Collier said “Lisa is an out-
standing player. During this past
weekend, Lisa began to assert her
leadership. 1 think,she’s only just
beginning to clarify her role on the
team. She played a level of volleyball
that she’ll need to continue in order
for us to be nationally successful.”

Walk-on sophomore Carolyn

Brown, though seldom used, played

her best games to date.

Every team member was able to
rise to the occasion, perhaps because
Pitt was forced to play a variety of
lineups. Notably, freshmen Denise
Frawly and Dianne Zerby contrib-
uted a great deal to the team effort.
Frawly had 61 kills in the tourna-
ment, and Zerbyuﬁlled in for injured
captain Judy Young, chalking up
130 assists (team high). Junior Sue
Hoover made 54 kills.

Following the Temple tourna-
ment, the Lady Panthers traveled to
Seton Hall. Seton, the second Big
East team Pitt has played. this sea-
son, also fell to the Panthers.

Sunday afternoon, the Panthers
jumped onto a bus bound for Phila-

Brown is out

Pitt fullback Tom Brown will miss
this Saturday’s contest between the

’ Panthers and West Virginia at Mor-

gantown. Brown left the Pitt-Boston
College game midway through the
contest and never returned. He will

most likely be replaced in the lineup '

by senior Darnell Stone.

“We are kind of banged up,” said
Pitt head coach Foge Fazio yester-
day. “Right now the only one that
Iffioks like he is out for the game is

‘ Tommy Brown. Hopefully, he might

have a miraculous recovery some-
where along the line.’’

Running back Charles Gladman,
the Panthers’ leading rusher with
387 yards, is listed as doubtful, but
Fazio said yesterday, “G1adman’s
ribs area little bit worse than I antic-

ipated. I asked him if it hurts when.
he laughs, and he said yes. That is

not a very good sign.”

Sophomore linebacker Jerry Wall
(sprained ankle) is progressing after
missing the last two games. He may
see some action.

Cornerback Quintin Jones (calf)
is doubtful.

delphia. Villanova was the final vic-
tory in a long weekend for Pitt.
Coach Collier felt that the team
accomplished some important goals
during the action. Collier said, “We
needed to win" the Temple tourna-
ment to gain some confidence in our
playing ability. We just made the
commitment to win.”

Pitt will host Big East rival Villa-
nova Friday at 7 p.m., Seton Hall at
3 p.m. and West Virginia Saturday
night at 7. The Lady Panthers go
into this weekend with a record of
13-3. All matches will be played in
the Fitzgerald Field House. These
matches - should show the high-
quality play of the Lady Panthers,
especially the match with Villanova.

This is the first weekend, Pitt will
be playing at home. Tonight, the
Lady Panthers will besponsoring a
clinic from 4-10 p.m. under the
direction of Debbie Green, 1984
Olympic team setter. '
