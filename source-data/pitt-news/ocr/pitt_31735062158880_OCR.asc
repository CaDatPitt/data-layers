Executive Committee Investigates
Consultation In Settling
Major Campus Problems

Meeting late yesterday afternoon, the executive committee
of Student Faculty Association discussed at length and passed

over the dam, the latest. reac-
tionary red lierring seems pret-
ty well pickled.

The idea behind the move is,
politically, not a new one. When
an administration comes into pow-
er, it is no new trick for the op-
posing side, slightly wary of the
apparent success of the enemy, to
dig deep, deep into the past, rake
up insignificant muck to discredit,
if they can, the achievement of
their adversary.

President Roosevelt has ap-
pointed Senator Black to the high-
est court of the‘ United States. He
has 1nag_le'that appointment, and

the Senate of» the United. States

has conﬁrmed itin full light of the
man’s past record.

But the appointment itself is not
the issue-—it is much bigger than
that. It seems that there is a
Court plan that has been the con-
cern these many months of a cer-
tain faction of thinkers in this
country. “Here is the first move
in that direction,” they think.
“Here is the President making his
first step toward packing our
Court. Nip it, nip it in the bud, no
matter how low you have to swing
to do it."

And so was born the Black in-f

tration wishes to have the policy of freedom of expression

3. In the pursuance of this policy the action of the Publica-
‘ tion Boardiof September 3 has been rescinded.
4. The editor’ of The News withdraws his resignation sub-

an attempt to express “average” opinion, but rather in writing
on controversial subject matter a. sincere effort will be made to
present both sides of the question.

high plane, especially in the matter of courtesy toward individ-

means through which the University is training the student
staff in journalism. To this end the Editor will review ques-
tionable copy of publication with the professor of journalism,
who will act as an edvisor and consultant.

6. It is understood  there may be times when a. dif-
ference of opinion on the propriety of publishing a given

Freshmen To Meet,
Faculty Advisers

Over 600 freshmen in the Col-9

their 42 faculty advisers Friday at
12:30 o’clock in the first of a series
of conferences, whose aim is to

Held, assistant to the dean of the
college.

At this first meeting, the advisers
and their freshmen numbering
from four to 15 in a group, will
become acquainted and arrange
for the future individual inter-
views, which will carry out the
function of the personnel depart-
ment of the College.

ADVISERS ASSIGNED
Wherever possible, students
have been assigned to advisers
who are also their teachers or on
the basis of preference expressed
by the student.

This first meeting is timed so

CENSUS SHEETS USED

Advisers are sent census sheets
from the College oﬁice for each
student, which contain information
about the student’s high school
record, standing in his graduation
class, family, home surroundings,
high school activities, vocational
objective, and score on the fresh-
man psychological examination.

This student-adviser relationship
enables the faculty adviser to fur-
nish the dean’s office with very
important information regarding
the student’s personality and char-
acter. It is virtually impossible
for the Dean to become personally
acquainted with every man in the
College, and so he relies on the
advisers recommendation. in all
matters pertaining to the student.

store are being given out this
week, and the exchange will be
closed until the end of this sem-

More than $400 worth of books
were sold by the store in the few
weeks that it has been open, and
according to Robert Forsythe, C40,
many more could have been sold
had the supply kept up with the
demand. ,

on a non-profit basis, except for

council undertook to manage the

their fund.

successful in obtaining a grant
from the federal government, I be-

groi-(l addressed (,7‘alit"ornia students yesterday‘

in a l7ni\'ersit_\' meeting devoted to a belated
observance of Constitution day. _ A

lntimating dzn-klv ol’ dictatorsliip and
1_vrann_v, Dr. Perigord struck what we inter-
preted to be veiled blows at the Roosevelt ad-
ministration and told University students that
social reforin must come only in the “Ameri-
can \‘Vay."

On Constitution day we wrote no editorial
extolling the virtues of American constitu-
tional democracy. ‘Ne did this, not because
we do not respect the fiuulamental principles
of American tradition. but because we believe
such traditions have been praised more than
enough already.

This country needs less
about the constitution and liberty and justice
and more constructive thinking‘ about progres-
sive governmental action.

\\'hile America debates academic niceties
in constitutional law, men and women the
country over are crushed and enslaved by
overpowering‘ economic forces.

\ Today 21 new hope has been given to the coin-
lll0ll man, :1 hope for a “more abundant life.”
It is the ideal that :1 nation can regulate its
‘resources, plan its national economic life, dis-
tribute employmeut and through collective ac-
tion meet the problems of insecurity, poverty
and depression.

Living in an age when the free play of cap-
italistic forces injures men and women with
casual brutality, America is called upon to
demonstrate that democracy can face such
problems and come out on top.

;Editor, The Pitt News; _
Far be it for me to criticize The
1 Pitt News 4 polls ‘ taken ‘on pertinent
‘topics of discussioni, _but_let me ex-
press my incl’ign"at’ion and protest"
on the p~re‘se‘nta=tion of questions
such as “Football subsi.da~tion” and
Football “salaa‘i‘es” to such ‘an un-
fortunately biased and sport inan-
iacal group as college’ students. V
Naturally,» it, is to be expected i
‘hat student opinion should reflect
r.-hc_ viewpoint of jorecloniinarice -
vithout regard ‘.0 educational and
nte'lect.ual obligations.

Any institution, which out-
rightly pays its sport heroes sal-
aries, is forfeiting the respect of
both the community and the world
of sports. It is substituting ﬁnanc-
ial ability of a university to buy
good players for honest and sin-
cere ability to produce good play-
ers. It smacks of rotten barter-
ing and t;ading, of mercenary en-
listment, of a :e.noney—tantamount—
to-victory attitude.

Let us carry on our program of
;ports upon a clean plane of hon-
orable competition, and place all
universities in a position to partic-
ipate without regard to ﬁnances
and contractural obligations.

Certainly, this point of View
constitutes the overwhelming
ticnd of public opinion. Let us
satisfy this foresighted op nion
rather than bow to the clamor of
sport-unbalanced students.

GREEN BALK-S

It was largely because of the
fact that William Green -and his
associates were unwilling to em-
brace ihe masses of American
workers, and preferred to rest
content with skimming off the
skilled workers only, other
words, to remain a minority, that
‘John L. Lewis led his group out
of the mother organization.

Mr. Green’s piesent stand is
somewhat rem"ndful of the fran-
tic clutchings of a drowning man.
The presidency of the AFL is a lu-
crative position, and Mr. Green
has beatedly decided upon a
course of action designed to re-
tain for himself that position.

Had he shown suchdecision, de-
termination, and activity at the
onset of the present spirit in the
forces of organized labor, it is
conceivable that a working com-
promise between the two factions
would be in effect today.

Events  the past summer in-
dicate that the breech is now irre-
parable. Unfortunately for all
concerned, an imra-la-bor war isl
in the offing. Mr. Green is loading
his heavy a:til1ery for a ﬁnish
fight. He had best carefully ex-

Panther Starting

Fullijaek,  
Q‘ualr’tie1‘l’?)ack
Posts Open

In an attempt to put together
something that resembles the old-
time Panther offense, Coach Jock
Sutherland indicated Monday that
there would be some wholesale I
changes in the starting line-up
that will take the ﬁeld against Du-
quesne on Saturday.

If you can remember back to
New Year’s Day, that offensive
‘power that the good doctor wants.
to rediscover was left in the Pasa-
dena Rose Bowl. There have been
points made this season by the
Panther varsity, but the manner
in which they were scored as-
sured the Pitt staff that against
strong opposition these touch-
downs would be lacking.

Instead of improving‘ in its sec-
ond gameat Morgantown, Pitt ap-
peared worse. Maybe this was
brought about by the stronger
team that the Mountaineers pre-
sented. At any rate, the Panther
puniness was accentuated.

FOUR REGULARS

Only four men are now assured ‘
of their positions. Bill Daddio,
Tony Matisi, Marshall Goldberg,
and Curly Stebbins are the only
regulars who have given a good
account oi‘ themselves.

Sutherland‘s particular griev-
ance is in the backﬁeld whe.re he
is disappointed in the fullbacking
and quarterbacking. Frank Pat-
rick’s play was hardly that of a
Pitt fullback. He was notoriously
missing on his blocking and his
inability to carry the ball effec-
ti'./elyweakened the entire offense

There is some possibility that
Bob Dannies, third team center,
will ﬁnd himself among thelsta'rt-
ers on. Saturday. The Pitt pivot
play has not been up to standard.

DUKES" EXCEL

While the Panthers have been
appie‘a_-rir’ig- far below their usual
stan,‘cl,ard,‘- the Dukes have been
i'iding along in an. improved style
this season. Jock Sutherland
claims the Dukes are “35 to 40
per cent better this year”.

In turning back Waynesbure;
and rolling past West Virginia
Wesleyan the Dukes have givenl
evidence of a smooth—workingI
outﬁt. They were really outstand- ‘
ing in their triumph over the Bob-
cats last week’. 4 A

Over on the Bluff there seems
to be a preponderance of good
backﬁeld men. George‘ Matsik, the'
gentleman who ran 75 yards in
the Stadium one rainy afternoon,
in good backﬁeld company. Brum-
baugh, McKeeta, Onder, Gallagher,
and Karrs give the Dukes a ﬁne
scoring array.

The tickets sale has jumped tre—
mendously this week and there is
the possibility of a sell—out for the
game Saturday. The 55,000 mark
has already been reached.

Duquesne’s head football coach,
‘Clipper Smith, was once an All-
American because of his great
l:nee—churning guard play for
Notre Dame. Today, The News’
sports department nominates him
as the All-American ’fraidy cat.

Two News scribes ankled onto
the Bluff piactice ﬁeld for a
friendly word with the Duke
mentor, Monday. One of the as-
sistant managers stopped them,
and asked, “What d’ya want?”
The reportexs were ﬂabbergasted,
in fact surprised, at such English.
They recovered their equanimity
quick like and identiﬁed them-E
selves. ,

Publicity Director Pennington
had puton a weeping act about
the sick and injured Night Riders,
for our boys. He expressed dra-

matic fear that the battered
Smithmen would never, never
survive the Pitt fracas. So good

was his make-believe, that the Pitt
snoopers were almost convinced of
the Duke’s sad state. by the time
they reached the side lines.
Surprise of surprises——a couple
of scrubs were a little tired around

the ankles, otherwise the Bluff
athletes looked menacingly
healthy. But I the estimable

Coach Smith looked peaked and
acted as jittery as a prospective
father. The Clipper didn’t say
anything to the Pitt newshounds
for awhile; he didn’t know they
were there.

When trainer Brute Jackson in-
formed him of this fact, Smith
snapped up. He looked as hei
would. look ‘if Goldberg ran the i
opening kick’-off back for a touch- I
down. He barked, “If you wanti
to see me’; see me in my otnce; But’!

Although Wisconsin merely eked
out a 12-0 victory over Mar-I

powers which they have. Notre
Dame with the greatest team since
Knute Rockiies famous team of
1930. remained under wraps to
win easily over Drake 21-0. Penn
State proved that it has retained
its former position in big time
football by setting Gettysburg
back 32 to 6.

In view of these scores it seems
that Pitt is in for eight afternoons
of the hardest football that any
of its teams have been up against.

By ALICE BENOVITZ

"'I’m more than glad to be back
in the United States. People here
don’t realize how well off they
are,” said Fabian Hoffman on his

return to Pittsburgh after a three- .

month world cruise. Hoffman, a
member of the varsity football
squad, last summer worked his
way around the world as assistant
in the purser’s department on a
Dollar Line boat.

When asked what one thing had

A
V

impressed him most, Hoffman said
that in every port in which the
boat had docked he saw again and
again indescribable poverty and
ﬁlth. Instead of escaping to the
ultra modern comfort of, English
hotels and international settle-
ments as most tourists do, he vis-
ited the native sections in India,»
Malay, and China. He found sani-
tary conditions in all these, native
quarters very" bad; In Penang, a
city in Malay, there is an open
canal in the middle of the street
which serves as the only sewage
system. , _ A, ,
Hoffman had"an' unusual e$:peri-
ence in Bombay, India. He” was

present at a ceremony‘ that not
many’ foreigners see-——the burning_
of the dead". The body, surround-
ed by logs, was placed on a pyre
under‘ which a huge ﬁre was built.
Lamenting and crying, the mourn-
ers surrounded the bier. Since no
one was permitted to take photo-_

Even with the devaluation of
the American dollar, it is still

‘ worth about three dollars in China.
f Hoffman took advantage of this, -

and spent a good deal of his sal-
ary on silks and curiosities. He

_ admitted that the things he bought"
' were probably

“typical
taste,” but he liked’ them.

At least three of the largest
items in the recent news have spe-

sailor’s

' cial interest to him. When he vis-

ited China, he noticed many for-
eign gunboats in the Whangpoo
river———the same‘ river that is the
center of so much ﬁghting in
Shanghai today. In Egypt he just

missed‘ seeing the newly-crowned

king in his parade 1 through the
streets. “ ’Tis better to have
missed history than never to have
been there at all, or something.”

But it was in the waters 100

miles south of Spain that Hoffman‘

sensed’ that he’ was in history-
makingitimes. The Dollar Line
steamer re”ce“ived two distress calls
from, ‘bombed ships. Since'"the

s-inking boats were so far away, -

Government Service
Course Rates High

By GERALD ZISKIND
Under the supervision of Dr. James C. Charlesworth, the
Government Service course has gained a high position in the

the department revealed today.

University curriculum, enjoying a. large student membership of
exceptionally high scholastic achievement, a careful scrutiny of

According to ﬁgures divulged by Dr. Charlesworth total
membership of combined classes at present number 62, despite
the fact that 12 students, who were not fulﬁlling the scholastic

requirements of the course, were¢

forced to withdraw.

This class thus far has main-
tained a 2.29 quality point average
——the highest in the department’s
history—raising the department’s
status to a most favorable position
for those who seek training instu-
mental in obtaining permanent
government civil service positions.

Dealing - with such subjects as
public administration, internation-
al trade, labor relations, and for-
eign service, any one of which the
student may select as a complete
course in itself, Government Serv-
ice initiates a new line of educa-
tion in the University’s life. _

But as never before in our na-
tion’s history, Dr. ' Charlesworth
pointed out, the demand for effic-
ient pubic servants is apparent.
The rapidly expanding powers and
departmental makeup of national
government necessitate the train-
ing of students. through the col-
leges for the occupancy of these
newly—created jobs.

Most important, too, and espec-
ially to the nation’s welfare, is the

ligent labor leadership. Unions
are here to stay, Dr. Charlesworth
added, and _“we might as well face
the problem of producing good la-
bor leaders. That’s why this course
of labor relationship was inaugu-
rated.” V , -

As for students selecting foreign
service in the department, great
opportunities, are presented each
year for consular and diplomatic
positions under the State depart-
ment. Examintations given
throughout the country determine
the eligability of applicants. Last
year, according to State Depart-
ment records, 112 persons passed
the exam, 40 of which were placed
upon the eligible list.

in which a substantial number of

dents are required to maintain’ at
least a “B” average, usually ma-
joring in Political Science or Eco-
