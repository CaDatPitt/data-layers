Sporting new, monogrammed SGB
sweatshirts, the Student Government
Board gathered at Tuesday’s weekly
public meeting to hear detailed up-
dates on Board members’ projects.
Last month, Board President Gor-
don Louderback announced that he
would be implementingproject check-

. points to keep the numerous initia-

tives for which Board members are
responsible in check. The first project
checkpoint took place at Tuesday’s
public meetinginNordy’s Place, which
about 40 people attended.

The checkpoint gave Board mem-
bers and chairpersons a chance to
share their accomplishments thus
far with the public, and according to
Louderback, was a good way to show
that they had not been wasting their
time.

Louderback gave updates on the
projects he campaigned on, all of
which are complete. Most recently,
Louderback created the Fundraising
and Advertising Committee to help

student groups pursue alternate

Te|eFact’sfuture funding remains uncertain

Shruti Revankar
Staff Writer

The fate of TeleFact’s future funding
lies in the hands of administrators
who remain undecided on the issue.

TeleFact, an over—the—pho_ne
fact-ﬁnding service whose purpose
is to assist Pitt students with any
questionsthey have as they make
their journey through college, re-
ceives its funding from the Student

cally funded formula group into
question and recommended an end
to Activities Fund allocations for
the group. But the Board deferred
the ﬁnal decision on funding to the
authority of Vice Provost and Dean
of Students Kathy Humphrey, who
said in an email Monday that she
is currently reviewing the recom-
mendation.

As previously reported in The
Pitt News, the Board passed a reso-
lution to recommend that by the
start of the 2014 ﬁscal year, Tele-

-Fact no longerbe recognized among

the four other organizations —-— Pitt

are Student Life Afﬁliated Groups
that are ﬁmded yearly by ﬁxed per-
centages of the Student Activities
Fund, which the Board distributes.
The Student Government Board
developed TeleFact in 1990, and
the service currently operates from
noon to 9 p.m. seven days a week.
If the organization’s status as a for-
mula group is lost, TeleFact will be
forced to petition for funding from
Student Government Board instead
of automatically receiving 3.4 per-
cent of the more than $2 million
Student Activities Fund each year.
At the December meeting, Board
members linked the rise in promi-
nence of smartphones to a decline
in the service’s popularity, and cur-
rent SGB President Gordon Louder-

 

back said that last year’s Board, on
which he served as a Board member,
found TeleFact no longer relevant
to student needs.

“Within a 4-year span, their
call percentages dropped approxi-
mately 75 percent, yet their budget
did not change,” Louderback said,
adding that the resolution that
began the allocation of ﬁxed per-
centages of the Student Activities
Fund to the formula groups has not
been revised since it was passed in
February 2009. He said the resolu-
tion needs to be updated to re—asses
the funding provided to each of the
groups. _

Corrections: In Monday’s story, “Dance marathon raises $61,872.16,” The Pitt News misquoted event coordinator Alex Murdoch as saying that Greek Week has raised about $300,000
over the past ﬁve years for various charities. Murdoch said he does not have current information on how much money the Pitt Dance Marathon or Greek Week has raised over the past
ﬁve years, and the $300,000 ﬁgure was-intended to refer to the size of the three—year pledge to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation that Pitt Greek Week is currently in the midst of fulﬁlling.

In a Feb. 21 article on an appearance by two former workers for PT Kizone — a factory in Tangerang, Indonesia, that produced products for Adidas and other companies — The Pitt
News quoted Viveka Mandava as saying that the group Americans for Informed Democracy paid for the donation of $1,000 it made in connection with the event through funds they
received from the Student Government Board. In fact, the group received only $500 for the $1,000 honorarium from SGB. It received the other $500 through the Outside the Classroom
Curriculum Mini—Grant Program. The Pitt News regrets the errors.

bylaws pertaining to her committee, and she is
working on creating them.

As part of his second initiative, Louderback
also put together a project-proposal link on
the SGB website and Facebook through which
student groups can propose projects online.
According to Louderback, students have used
the link to give advice and recommendations
to SGB for about a month.

“So far, it’s been a great way to hear the stu-
dents’ feedback on projects,’-’ Louderback said,
notingthatthe Board had even heardfrom some
parents.

Hisﬁnalproject involved makingthe Alloca-
tions process transparent. Louderback achieved
this goal by having the Board keep a running
total of money allocatedfrom the StudentAct:ivi-
ties Fund so far this semester. Board member
and SGB business managerjohn Cordier. now

announces how much of the fund the Board '

has allocated at the end of each week’s public
meeting. This way, Louderback said, everyone
is aware of how the Board spends money from
the $2.3 million Student Activities Fund.

Board member Amelia Brause said her initia-
tive with the most momentum is her Healthy
U initiative. She has worked with other Board
members to create a Healthy U incentive pro-
gram, throughwhich theywillfocus on promot-
ing one of the seven tenets of Pitt’s Healthy U
program each month.

To kick this off, Brause plans on holding an
event at which students can do yoga on the Ca-
thedral Lawn in the fall and hopes to attract new
students to promote the program.

“Ithinkthatwillbe areally goodway to gain
awareness,” Brause said.

Brause is also working on an‘ event for stu-
dent groups called Ftmdraising Week that she
hopes to have ready to take place after the Activi-
ties Fair in the fall.

Board member David Rosenthal said his
efforts to improve bus transportation to the
Pittsburgh airport were stalling.

“I hit a bit of a roadblock,” Rosenthal said.

Because of contractual issues with Port A11-
thority, Rosenthal said there was nothing he
could do to improve the bus route to the airport.
But Rosenthal is looking into alternatives for
airport transportation, such as a taxi service.

In his effort to get a course offered that
teaches students how to cook healthy,efﬁcient

meals, Rosenthal’s said his efforts are succeed-
ing. He said Pitt’s food—service provider, Sodexo,
has given organizers the green light to use its
kitchens for the classes. He will next have to
talkto adietician and University administration
members to work on ﬁrnding and curriculum.

Rosenthal is also working on a project to
educate students who want to move off cam-
pus about tips for dealing with landlords, and
said he was looking for an accessible location
at which to hold ﬁiture seminars for students.
Although Pitt’s Office of Off-Campus Living al-
ready provides such seminars, Rosenthal said
itwould be better to hold theminearly October
or November, since students usually look for
apartments in the fall semester. . I

Board memberjohn Cordier said that he
wanted to workwith Rosenthal on the landlord-
and-tenant-relationship initiative as part ofhis
South Oal<land—irnprovement project.

Board member Mike Nites is working on
making the Allocations—request process avail-
able online, and said he has been tinkering
with diiferent programs, such as the database
Symplicity, that add ﬂexibility for the Alloca-

~ tions forms.

On her platform to improve sexual education
on campus, Board member Sowrriya Sanapala

said shelhad closely researched what the Uni-
versity offered in terms of birth control, and
wanted to help student groups put on educa-
tional programming.

“After examining what we do have offered,
I’ve decided to institute a condom—request form,”
Sanapala said.

With the request form, student groups ‘

should be able to get condoms ‘for free from
Student Health"5.nd provide them to students
at public events.

Board member Sarah Winston said she for-
malized her efforts to getatextbookswap putin
place, but did not elaborate on the details. Chair
of the SGB Academic Affairs Committee Nuwan
Perera will work to increase communication
between students and the campus bookstore.
According to Perera, the formation of the com-
mittee to formalize the textbook swap is sﬁll in
progress.

working with Sodexo on his initiative to offer
more meal plan options and with Pitt adminis-
trators to get the results of Pitt’s OMETteaching

of students and director of Student Life, who
serves as an adviser for TeleFact, validated
the argument of the Board.

“Based on data collected and reported
by TeleFact,there has been a signiﬁcant and
progressive decrease in [TeleFact] usage over
the last 5 to 6 years,” Bonner said in an email.

But Bonner said he also believes that,
in addition to call rates, students’ opinions
of TeleFact and other student-run services
should be considered in their funding. ’

TeleFact Coordinator Kayla Mormak said
in an email that despite the prevalence of
smartphones in modern society, TeleFact is

still a service worth keeping.

‘‘Nearly 50 percent of the student popu-
lation still uses a standard phone with no
Internet connection,’_’ she said. “There are
currently more students without smart-
phones on Pitt’s campus than there were total
students at Pitt when TeleFact ﬁrst opened.”

Mormak conﬁrmed that last year’s 23,265
calls fell below past yearly totals, but she
claims the decline resulted not from a de-
crease in need but, rather, from a lack of
advertising.

Mormak said that information about Tele-
Fact was dropped from the Pathﬁnders’ tour
scripts in 2009, and emails sent last fall to the
SGB advertising chair, which the organization
made in an attempt to develop more TeleFact

advertising through SGB, went unanswered.

According to Louderback, there was no
advertising chair last fall — only a public
relations chair.

“Our public relations chair was to pub—
licize [SGB’s] activities, not those of other
groups,” said Louderback, who created an
fundraising and advertising SGB subcom-
mittee just earlier this calendar year to help
interested student groups ﬁnd and develop
their own means of funding.

Mormak said that TeleFact is needed
especially at Pitt because the academic bu-
reaucracy is somewhat confusing. She said
that miscommunication sometimes arises

between different departments within the

University, leaving students unclear on

to navigate the bureaucracy.

“That’s what we do: We pull all parts of the
University together to provide an expert Pitt
service, even when the rest of the offices are
closed for the night,” Mormak said.

Mary Anderson, a freshman at Pitt, said
that she had not heard of TeleFact before, but,
after reading about the service that TeleFact
had to offer, she was willing to give it a try.

_ “Now that I know what TeleFact is, I would
probably use it to get quick answers to ques-
tions that I couldn’t easily ﬁnd the answer to,”
Anderson said.

TeleFact is currently running a “SaveTele-
Fact” campaign through its Twitter account.
Every day, service employees tweet ﬁin facts
to increase the organization’s number of fol-
lowers. Mormak said the group is up 500
followers since September. As of press time,
Telefact had 1,539 followers on Twitter.

TeleFact is also developing new question-
answering strategies in order maintain its
relevance. Mormak said she is drafting a pro-
posal to make TeleFact more technologically
friendly through the use of text messages,
Twitter and possibly live chat. She hopes
that these additional measures will help keep
TeleFact alive.

“TeleFact has been my love since I started
at Pitt in 2008,” said Mormak, who started

would truly hate to see such an interesting
and unique Pitt tradition die because we were

Google Glass and other technologies
end any expectation of privacy

Jonathan Fischer

Columnist
There’s a lot of buzz about a new set
of glasses manufactured by Google.
Although the product hasn’t been
released yet, it’s marketed as an
“augmented—reality” technology to
add to our arsenal of useful everyday
gadgets.

It’_s also a $1,500 Big Brother
strapped to your face.

Soon enough, the government
and corporations will be scratching
to get a piece of your private space
now thatthis new technology, previ-
ously never available as more than a
demo unit, will soon be sold’ to the

public. Augmented-reality—type
glasses or displays are nothing new,
but any product funded by Google
deserves special attention.

Google is such an institution,
after all, that the Oxford English
Dictionary started considering the
company name a legitimate verb in

2006. The word refers to the act of

searching for anything online.
But the company behind the term

has higher ambitions than just bell   

ing a search engine. Google CEO
and co—founder Larry Page wants
to expand Google beyond consum-

ers’ time spent online, seeking .to~ ;.

4  . 5  ssion, saying, “You
,  iagine your brain being aug-
mented by Google. For example, you
think about somethingand your cell

  

phone could whisper the answer into,

your ear.”

Google Glass ﬁts into this mod-
el. We can see in a “point of view”
teaser—video for the product that
the technology can accept incom-
ing phone calls, take instant photos
and videos and display all sorts of
information using voice commands
via a little glass frame in the upper-
right corner of the glasses.

Although the majority of Google’s
proﬁts come from advertising reve-
nue, direct advertising isn’t a compo-
nent of this new technology. Google
has already stated, “There are no
plans for advertising on this device.”

But in a much less direct way, this
device will seriously inﬂuence adver-

tising. This will be done through the
I ~ '

real problem of Google Glass: the in-
vasion into our lives. I am concerned
with real—time data being streamed
to the world and our gradual accep-
tance of inviting corporations into
our lives.

George Orwell’s Big Brother
consisted of telescreens that could
never be turned off, peering into ev-

ery crevice of the,‘ci,ty.,_If:used to its”

 V, ‘d not freely give away this

 information.

With the technology of a smart-
phone, including Wi-Fi, 4G tether-
ing capabilities. and a built-in GPS,
Google Glass provides the company
with a lot of information to give
away. Every single thing you see,
to whom and what you speak, your

purchases and what you do in your
own home are fair game. Your eyes,
in the form of glasses, become the
mobile Big Brother Orwell’s novel
portrayed.

Our society is already constantly
being data—mined for information
in order to tailor advertisements
based on patterns of interest. Gen-
erally, this takes place behind the
scenes in our everyday lives: There
is nothing so overbearing as to dis-
rupt our tasks throughout the day.
We’ve slowly accepted that before
watching content streamed on the
web, we must endure a 30—second
advertisement before viewing. It has
become annoying protocol.

Google Glass doesn’t do anything
necessarily new, but it adds an ease
of access to this information. The
glasses will ultimately lead to the
success of more tailored content
that just expands on this accepted
standard in ways beyond what we

already know and ‘acc,ep,t;,,into out ‘

pijgate lives andtlioughts.

improve Google’s databases of information. If
Google makes the majority of its proﬁts from
ads, it should be obvious that even if we won’t
see ads on the glasses, ads are the purpose of
the product. As with the intent of all innova-
tive products released by corporations, this
will generate revenue for Google Inc. We must
remember this before we continue accepting
technology so freely into our lives.

Otherwise, Orwell’s classic quote, “Big
Brother is watching you,” might need to be
changed to “Big Brother is watching through
you.” I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the editor,

I wanted to brieﬂy comment on the
editorial you published last Wednesday
regarding Downtown development. I was
pleased with its summary of previous
developmentstrategies (notably Mayor
Murphy’s attempt to create a retail dis-
trict) and its description of the current
growth of residential development in

Downtown. However, your opinion staff a

noted, in line with conventional wisdom,
that the Downtown entertainment options
are outside. the price range for students.
This is true with many of downtown Pitts-

burgh’s amenities, but not with all of them.
Furthermore, there is a real effort by the
Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership to alter
both the perception and reality in order to

‘ draw more students.

Student Government Board, as well as
the broader Pittsburgh Student Govern-
ment Council, made up of the student body
leaders from universities across the city,
recently met with a representative of the
Downtown Partnershipto discuss this very

issue. They are eager for ideas on how to-

improve this perception and are eager to
share those Downtown destinations that
are within the price range of students;

many options are no more expensive than

a typical meal at the popular Forbes and

Murray avenues intersection.

In short, I am glad to see these issues
being discussed. PSGC is working with the
Downtown Partnership to create exactly
what the article notes as lacking: a clear
plan for increased student integration. We
are always looking for feedback and insight
into how this can be possible.

 Panthers seek win over lowly South Florida

SPORTS

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Nate Barnes
Senior Stcyj” Writer

In its second-to-last home game of the sea-
son, the Pitt men’s basketball team receives
a visit from the Bulls of South Florida — one
of the Big East conference’s cellar dwellers
in the league standings.

No. 23 Pitt (21-7, 9-6 Big East) ran its
previous opponent, St. John’s, off the ﬂoor
at Madison Square Garden in New York
City on Sunday, behind a career-high 25
points from redshirt senior point guard
Tray Woodall.

“He was terriﬁc in every way,” Pitt head
coachjamie Dixon said of Woodall. “I think
every shot he took was a great shot. He
handled the ball well and he played good
defense.”

After the Panthers suffered defeat in
back—to -back games against Marquette and
Notre Dame, Woodall knew that Pitt needed
to beat St.]ohn’s and regain momentum as
the regular season nears its end.

“It was a must win. I think everybody
strapped down,” Woodall said. “I was com-
fortable. I am a senior and I should be com-
fortable out here. I wanted to try and shift
the momentum of the team.”

The Panthers should not expect to need
another game-winning performance from
Woodall on Wednesday, with South Florida
(10-16, 1-13 Big East) entering the Petersen
Events Center as the loser of nine consecu-
tive games.

USF’s only victory in Big East play this
season came at the USF Sun Dome — the
Bulls’ home ﬂoor _— injanuary against the
conference’s current leader, Georgetown.
How the Bulls won the game still bewilders
the college basketball world, as the Hoyas
visited South Florida with a completely
healthy roster.

The Bulls are led by junior Victor Rudd,
a 6—foot—9 forward who leads USF in both
scoring and rebounding at 11.5 points and
7.1 rebounds per game. Rudd almost led his
team to victory a week ago against St. John’s
with a double-double, scoring 18 points and
registering_11 rebounds.

Flanking him in the post is 6-foot-8 Toar—
lyn Fitzpatrick. The senior ranks second to
Rudd in both scoring and rebounding for

the Bulls, putting up 10.2 points per game 5

and pulling down 5.2 rebounds per game.
With these two talented players in the
frontcourt, Pitt’s big-man trio of freshman
Steven Adams, redshirt junior Talib Zanna
and senior Dante Taylor will need to ensure
neither Rudd nor Fitzpatrick has the kind
of game that could lead to an upset of the
Panthers by USF, who beat Pitt in both con-

Collins runs the show for USF head coach

points per game and handing out 6.4 assists

thus far.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

No. 3 UConn
crushes Pitt to

extend lengthy
losing streaks

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

Looking for its first Big East victory in
more than two years, the Pitt women’s
basketball team faced a team it hasn’t
beaten in 20 years.

At the home of one ofthe sport’s most
decorated programs, the Panthers suf-
fered a predictable fate on Tuesday night:
a heavy defeat. The 76-36 loss to No. 3
Connecticut extends Pitt’s overall los-
ing streak to 14 games, its losing streak
against the Huskies to 28 games and its
conference losing streak to 34 games.

The contest began well for the Pan-
thers (9-18, 0-14 Big East) after head
coach Agnus Berenato’s team snatched
an early 6-5 lead following a jump shot by
sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel.

But after Pitt hung tough for a few

more minutes, the Huskies (26-2, 13-1
Big East) used a 20-2 run to blow the game
open and head into the locker room with
an insurmountable 37-13 advantage at
halftime. L
L A 6-0 run at the beginning of the
second half showed that the Panthers
wouldn’t give up and cut the deficit to
just 20, but Pitt always faced an uphill
battle against legendary head coach Geno
Auriemma’s national-championship—seek-
ing Huskies. The Panthers would get no
closer, as Connecticut slowly extended
its lead for the remainder of the game.

Despite a poor 4—for—22 shooting night,
Kiesel led Pitt with 11 points and six re-
bounds, whilejunior forward«Asia Logan
also recorded 10 pointsﬂand four rebounds

iii the losing effort. Meanwhile.,..,soph’o-
more forward Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis
paced (3}n1;e.ct«ici1t"— winner of 13 con-

‘sfecu-tive Big East games ——- with a double-

” double of 19 points and 13 rebounds.

The Panthers hope to ﬁnally break
their lengthy conference losing streak
when DePaul visits the Petersen Events

Center on Saturday at 1 p.m. Despite
having no seniors to honor in the final
home game of the campaign, Pitt needs
no further motivation — the Panthers

want revenge for the heartbreaking last-
second defeat they suffered against the

Blue Demons in late January. I

The International Olympic Committee’s
recent decision to drop wrestling from
its list of 25 “core” sports for the 2020
Summer Olympics was met with shock
and outrage around the world.

Many countries have formed commit-
tees to assist FILA, wrestling’s interna-
tional governing body, to make a push for
reinstatement into the Olympic Games,

Wrestling World Cup. An ABC News report
video shows an ecstatic crowd cheering
for both the U.S. and Iranian teams while

  

during the opening ceremonies, where
a team member from each of the 13 par-
ticipating nations — other participating
countries included Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Hungary, Ka-
zakhstan, Japan, Russia, South Korea and
Turkey —~ held up a sign that read “Olym—
pics without wrestling: Never, never ...” in
both English and Farsi.

“Politically, 'we’re not always on the
same page with Iran, or politically with
Russia,” USA Wrestling spokesperson
Mitch Hull said in an international news

 

bringing together two unlikely allies in
an attempt to save Olympic wrestling: the
United States and Iran.

Yes, you read that right; America and
Iran agree on something.

Why can’t wrestling diplomacy work?

The blow from the IOC’s decision per-
haps hit hardest in Iran, where wrestling
is a national sport intrinsically tied to
the culture. Wrestling dates back to the
Achaemenid,Persian Empire in the sixth
century B.C., when the sportlwas included
in military training. Ancient texts describe
