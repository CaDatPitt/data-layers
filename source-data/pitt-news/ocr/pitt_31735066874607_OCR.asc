  A Christmas Editorial 0
The spirit of Christmas lives on—through 2,000 years,
and through another 2,000 years to -come——through mass
produced verse on Christmas cards,~mandatory shopping
lists, and skinny Santa Clauses dinging bells by every trash
/ basket. Cynics cannot shatter it. Their curly jeering grins - . _
are met with heartfelt smiles of pity. People are warm and  " 
joyful as they, push around Santa Clauses to ﬁnd the authen- -
tic Mr. Claus -with spirit and joy bulging over his black
‘belt buckle. T ‘ . ’ ' . r . ' » —
, . Ebeneezer.,Scrooge’s words “Out upon merry Christ-
mas! .What’s Christmas to you but atime for paying bills
‘ without mo"ney, a time for ﬁnding yourself a year older and
'not an hour richer . . .” fall dead on happy souls. .
" Ah, more than an hour richer, Ebeneezer. A. year older,
,_ yes. But a year’s growth is not a thing to be feared or to
crouch from.’ But a thing to bewelcomed, along with the
'_wealth, knowledge: and happiness’ that it brings “with it.
‘And with each year’s growth, riches that ‘ﬁll inﬁnity, not
~a"n‘ hour’s short minutes. ‘ - ' ,_
‘ And it is when the last snowﬂake has fallen on --3373-‘ii?
Christmas Eve, the last sleighbell has rung through " 
the cold [air over the hill, and the last ‘silver icicle
has been stretched over a pine needle, that, the true
Christmas takes over. , .

Christmas means many things. Memory. _ Stealing
downstairs in the dusk ‘to feel the big packages and to - 5
suspiciously eye the small ones. The memories recalled    '
by a blue 1ight’s reﬂection on tinsel, smoke curling from -  '
the ﬁreplace into green boughs on’ the mantel, the voices 
of choir boys ﬂoating through the stained glass windows,

' the moon’s thick rays tilted at warty treetrunks in the
front yard. A snowman hunching over the picket fence.
Christmas is music. Music that -must sprout from so
many happy, laughing voices. The peace in the lines of
.‘‘Silent Night,” the hope and trust in the lines of "‘Oh ‘Come
All Ye Faithful,” the festivity in the lines of “Deck the
Halls.” One could not resist throwing money and -cheers
— tola group singing “Noel” at the front door. It is contagious.
Inhibitions are discarded and more voices join in. And hap-
piness and good cheer spreads. » e
a Christmas is home. A time for reunion. _For only’ then
is happiness complete. The intimacy of the thoughts ‘be-
hind every tinted ball is only whole when shared by_ all
the far'nily——the family that has shared intimacy for years.
The years from the firs’ mil in the hospital to marriage
vows in the church. The inner warmth of carving a sizzling
turkey, of childrens’ squeals of delight at the contents of
untied packages, of thanksgiving. The time for singing
carols around the piano, poppingpopcorn over scarlet em:
bers, sipping Tom and J errys. At home love and’ laughter
have a real meaning. Home, a temple. s » _  _ 

Christmas is good will toward men. Whatever draws 0 ' _ . =  » _ . . " - _  _

Scrooge’s salvation. It is wiping the tears from a small _ ____ _ I
boy’s face ‘pressed against a store window, and leading  2 _ . _ '  ' " 
him inside by his chubby hand‘. It is the warmth that V ' ' - - " "

Nutting Defends Debate

Dr. Charles B. Nutting, vice'chancell(*«r,, defended the
right of college debaters to discuss recognition of Red China
at a banquet in the Harvard—Yale-Princeton,Club which cli-
maxed Pitt’sseventh annual Cross-Examination Debate tour-

The vice chancellor suggested that those who would
restrict public discussion of such matters as the Red China

to trust truth or to trust young

truth.

“If we allow such fears to pre-
vail,” he declared, “we may well
fear for the future of a country
where thought may be controlled

as on the other side of the iron
curtain.”

men and women in their search for "

and speech stiﬂed on this, as well

“The question raised by this ar-
gument goes to the very heart of
our concept of the nature of edu-
cation and of our political institu-
tions,” Dr. Nuttjng said. “Cer-
tainly there can be no denial that
free discussion is basic to a dem-
ocratically organized society and
to a worthwhile college education."

"Louise told her you would be a swell blind date. but

-fshe must have found out about you anyway."

Tea Often Sligh ted
Christmas and New Years are two holidays which are
not to be denied. They denote good timesand an all too
brief respite from the troubles of an unduly troubled world.
Unfortunately they also result in a rise in highway traf-
ﬁc and consequently a rise in the accident rate. Poor roads

and bad driving conditions are responsible in ajcertain
number of accidents but by far the highest toll is taken

’ by that uncontrolable variable, the man behind the wheel.

Last year bowed out as 1954 was usheredin by millions
of celebrants allover the world, but it took with it 38,300
lives, lives lost in traﬁic fatalities. It left 1,350,000 injured

persons to celebrate New Years Eve as best they could and

look back upon a year which brought to each a measure
of sorrow which need not have been. .

The automobiletoday is geared to the same fast pace’
which_ the world has set for itself. People all over the na-

-tion beat an impatient tatoo on accelerators and horns as

they hurry to get where they are going and, after they have
ar_rived, most wonder where they are and why they hur-
ried in the ﬁrst place.

And_still it continues, this protesting grinding of gears
as the cars accelerate through the towns and down the high-
ways, this tortured shriek of rubber on cement as they

lurch blindly around corners, this duet of brakes and tires;

as they screamto a halt at stop lights which.were plainly
visible two blocks away. .

Bad. roads, rain, snow, sleet, fog, all take their toll, but
their’s is a minor list when placed beside the total accident
rates for the year. - . "

Certain measures can and must be taken to keep a car

’ in the mechanical shape which is responsible for its proper

operation. Certain measures ar_e taken to keep roads in
proper‘ shape. These cut ‘down the possibilities of accidents
due to mechanical defects. 

Still there remains the one factor which is capable of

~ over-riding the limits of safety. This factor sits behind the

wheel and by the movements of his hands, and feet con-
trols, for the moment, his life and the lives of all who
tr_ave1 or walk down the road which he drives. His safety
and their’s hingesonthe ability to exercise sound judge-
ment. An easy task,’ too often slighted. ‘

, high ﬂying jet plane rolls down 

By Jim DeWeese

It was on December 17,1 1903, just two days
short of 51 years ago, that ﬁve men and a boy
stood atop Kill Devil Hill near Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina, and witnessed what has proved to be the
beginning of one of the most dramatic and inspir-
ing phases of the world’s history. On that same
hilltop there now stands a tall ‘monument to two
of these men, the brothers Or-
ville and Wilber Wright, who,
on that cold gusty day, intro-
duced powered ﬂight to a dis-
believing world.

Today that .world stops to _
listen as the thunderclap of a i

from unseen heights. But it pays 2
no more than a nodding tribute 
to the men who rip a path 5  .
through the unchartered reaches of the sky. The
men who die in unproven aircraft so that planes
may_ be made safe for the people who scurry aim-
lessly about on the face of the earth 50,000 feet
below. . ‘

Through the Barrier ,

On September 27, 1946, England was within
reach of attaining a goal for which the aircraft in-
dustries of the world had all been striving—-an air-
craft which could exceed the speed of sound. Little
was known about the legendary “supersonic wall”
but the ‘British had a plane which" they thought
could elbow its way through and into the silent
realm of supersonic ﬂight. *

On that day Geoffrey R. DeHavi1land pointed
the nose of an experimental jet plane toward the
English Channel and made his bid for the prize.
Somewherein that blinding dive his ship exploded
leaving only fragments of aluminum to fall back
to earth and mark his death. He had been chief
test pilot for the DeHavilland Co. His plane had,
been the DH-108, a design for which-his father
had-been responsible. Just two years later the
same type aircraft successfully cracked the sound
barrier and returned for a triumphal landing at
the DeHavilland ﬁeld. By his death, Goeffrey
DeHavil1and had shown the ﬂaw in an otherwise
perfect plane, a ﬂaw which had to be unearthed
in ﬂight. ’ 1

 

A Breecl Apart   

    

   

A few~—weeks ago George Welch, recognized as
one of this country’s greatest pilots, died as he
was testing the F-100 Super Sabre high above
the arid desert of California. Welch was chief test
pilot for North American Aircraft, a company long
concerned with building the fastest planes in the
world for the defense of the United States. The
F-100 had been designed expressly to exceed the
speed of sound in level ﬂight. In May, 1953,, Welch
piloted the F-100 on its maiden ﬂight and twice
cracked the speed of sound without diving.’ On
October 30 of_that year the ship set a new inter-
national record of 755 miles per hour while ﬂy-
ing at an altitude of only_5O feet, a speed far in
excess of the speed of sound.

The Air Force had already decided to use this
plane as its first line of air defense but before
they could accept delivery the ship had to be
thoroughly tested and proven safe for Air Force
pilots to fly. Three weeks ago George Welch took

the F-1O01‘into the biting cold of the stratosphere "

and literally tried to make it come apart. It stood
all the tests prescribed by the Air Force but Welch
was not satisfied. He had been an Air Force pilot
himself. He had shot down the ﬁrst Jap plane
on December 7,, 1941 and had been highly decor-
ated by the Air Force. He knew what a’ young
pilot might do if he got his hands on a plane as
powerful as the Super Sabre.

In Their Stead

So Welchfclimbed the ship until the spectators
on the ground could no longerfollow it with their
binoculars.‘ Then he unleashed all the power in
its engine and put the plane into along Vertical
dive, a ‘dive in which he left the thunder of his
passing far‘ behind. _He pushed the ship far be-
yond the limits which its builders had set. And
somewhere in" the space of the few seconds that

- it tookfor that gleaming ﬁghter to complete its

dive something went wrong and George Welch
died. He died in the stead. of uncounted young
pilots who might have been tempted to do just
what he had done.

These men are typical of those who, since that
day 51 years ago, have worked ‘to make air travel
safe. But they are typical of -no others. For they
are a breed unto themselves, these men such, as
DeHavilland and Welch who reach beyond that
pointiwhere man knows he will be safe.

Arny Landy, Bus. Ad. president
in charge -of the dance, repre-
sented the executive committee
at a Monday SC‘ meeting where
he ,was promptly ‘confused by
points of order, points of infor-

fused solons. ,
Delays and Confusion
Congress could have simply
voted on the proposal‘ to avoid

' further“ delay,’ bu-t instead, sent
V it to the social committee. Then

members debated their authority
to pass on the affair.

The presiding. officer assumed
a completely lost air and after

unnecessary discussion . referred 2

the whole problem to -a later

, meeting.

By this time freshmen were
disgusted as they well should
have been. _ .

’Now" the. wrong could have
been rectified by hearty endorse-
ment from the exec committee.
But a resitant group of officers
passed the formal only last Mon-
day and at the request of« Dean

8 Visitors Christmas in Other Countries

Prosperity Impresse

Oxford Debaters Dislike
American Tea; English.
Oppose McCarthyism,

By mv ROTHMAN

With a bit of an inquisitive
air and a spot of nonchalance,

two Oxford debaters arrived -

at Pitt Saturday to participate
in the Seventh Annual Cross-
Examination Debate tourna-
ment. ‘

Derek Bloom of St. Edmund
Hall College, and Peter Tapsell,
Merton College, have been touring
the eastern United States for the
past two months. As representa-
tive of the Oxford union society,
a British literary club, the men

‘have debated a variety of world

issues. Last weekend, in Pitt’s
public debate they argued the af-
firmative for recognition of Red
China. ‘

English Against McCarthy

However, “in England the ques-
tion is not discussed at all,” said
Peter \Tapsell. “It’s taken for
granted that we’ve granted recog-
nition” to the Peking government.
“After all, it’s been four years,”
he reminded.

Speaking on the McCarthy
issue, Tapsell said, “Englishmen
on the whole are against Mc-
Carthy.” Bloom ” quipped, “I
haven’t met anyone for him-at
least violently.”

Twenty-four year old Derek
Bloom from Northumberland has
received top honors at Oxford
University in Modern Greats
_which includes politics, philosphy,
and economics. He lists himself as
a member of the National Speak-
ers’ Panel, Conservative party.

Tapsell World Traveler

Peter Tapsell who lives in Sus-

A Sex might well be considered a

world traveler. He has visited
France, Italy, Malta, Egypt, Pales_
tine, Lebanon, Syria, and Trans-
jordan as well as Sudan, Kenya,
Tanganyika, and Uganda. He is
also an active worker in the Con-
servative party. Tapsell ‘attained
first class honors in his specialty,
modern history. Both are veterans
of the Royal Army.

“The high level of prosperity”
has impressed them most in’
their tour through the states.
Americans ‘show “great hospi-
tality” Tapsell said.

But in England things are get-
ting better. “Nothing is short. You
can buy anthing,” he said. But the
British still like to receive hams
through the mail because they are
so expensive.

A Dislike Tea Bags

One thing the visitors don’t like
however, is American tea. “Espe-
cially tea bags. They’re unbear-
able,” Bloom said. Tapsell express-
ed a more conservative viewpoint
when he pointed out, “We don’t
like American tea just as people
here don’t like British coffee.”

Both debaters turned to Pitt
Coach Robert Newman for an ex-
planation’ of cross—examination
rules. Th-ey never participated in
a tourney where debaters could

They did.

Second Hal? Splurge

Gains 2nd Straight Win

B)’ GENE AROMATORIO

, After a shaky ﬁrst half, Coach Bob’Timmon’,s Panthers
_ roared back at the Field House last night to brush off Col-,
gate 80-67 for their second straight win. The Red Raiders

were undefeated until the Panthers showed their teeth.

When the teams left the ﬂoor at halftime the score was
knotted ‘at 32 all but the locals wasted no time in taking a,

commanding 12-point lead. From there on in, the‘Panthers

A After the game Timmons re-
marked that he was pleased with
the way things went in the second
half. The ﬂoor tutor observed,
“That third quarter has been our
weak spot but this time we got
enough of a lead then, so we were
able to hold -the ball, causing them

to come out and foul us.”

Leading the Blue and Gold
throughout the game was Captain
Ed Pavlick’ with 28 points and
sophomore Bob Lazor with 1,9:
Pavlick was the big gun that kept
his teammates in contention dur-
ing the ﬁrst half with his deadly

ment.

Now, after three games in ﬁve
days under their belts, the
Panthers can rest from game com-
petition until Saturday night
when they travel to Madison
Square Garden to meet New York
University. I _

Since this game will be the ﬁrst
glimpse of the Gardens for the
Panthers, Timmons is more than
slightly worried that his hoopstérs
may be a little awed by the
surroundings. Besides this, Tim-
mons remarked, “Those New York
teams are fast and ‘they run you
a lot.”

Frosh Dump Dukes, 71-56;
Peques Leads "Fourth Victory

Led by hustling Julius Pegues, the Panther Frosh show-. ,
ed a well balanced attack last night as they beat the.Du—
V quesne Frosh for the ﬁrst time in nine years, 71-56..

This was the‘ ﬁrst defeat for the downtown rivals while

the Skyscraper yearlings are still unbeaten.
The contest which was the preliminary to the varsity

game at the Field House, was

close for the ﬁrstpﬁve minutes,
the score standing at 11-10 in

I favor of the Pittites. Pegues went

to work at this point hitting two
fouls and two lay—ups in quick
succession to give the Panthers a
17-10 lead. Julius scored 115 points
in the ﬁrst half and at the midway
point the Cubs lead by twelve.»

In the
moved to a seventeen point lead
but an eight point rally led by the
Duke's Bob Depalma cut the mar-
gin to nine halfway through the
period. The Cubs put a stop to
the Duquesne "rally here and went
on to win by the 71-56 count for
their fourth triumph.

Pegues was the Cub’s
scorer for the fourth consecutive
time. He scored 23 points to move
his season total to 84, giving him
a 21-point average.

Soph Battle Shapes Up

As Swimmers Open

It will be a battle of sophomores against sophomores as
Coach B_en Grady’s tankers take on theRed Raiders from
Colgate in the opening meet of the season tonight at the PAA

Colgate comes here with a highly-rated -young team, eight
of their 16-man squad being sop-9 ' '

homores. They will be led by Dick
Cosledge, th eir captain, who
swims‘ in the free-style events;
Bill Grohe, a junior freestyler
and backstroker; Ernie Smet-
burst, a soph distance man; and
Howard Maskof, a senior back-

I stroke and individual medley man.

Double Duty Expected
Grady will counter with a rela-

. tively small squad, meaning that

most of the Panthers will have to
do double duty, and some of them
will have to swim in three events
-—-the maximum allowed in col-
lege swimming. ‘
Probable starters for the Pan-
thers are soph Bernie Bauer, and

‘ senior Dick Finder, both from All-,

derdice, in the breaststroke events;'
Bill Furrer, senior ‘from Wilkins-
burg, Ben Sklar, soph from All-
derdice, Warne White, soph from
Perry, junior Henry Zenfgraf from
South Hills, and Jim Zurcher, the
junior record breaker from Oliver,
in the freestyle events; Skip Mon-
sein, junior from Schenley in the

rbackstroke; Roy Kaupe of Pea-

body in the individual medley;
and Ralph, Gaetano of South Hills
and Bert Marks from Kiski in the
diving events.
Colgate May Be Tired

Coach Grady and his assistant
Jim Palmer, star diver from last
year’s squad, have driven the boys
hard to get them in shape for the
early opening meet. “We practiced
long and hard for this meet and
hope to win?‘ by being in better
shape than Colgate,” says Coach
Grady.

CLOTHES MAKE THE BMOC

/' ‘\\
A few weeks agopl discussed fashions for coeds.’ I pointed out then
that any irl who really wanted to go places on campus had to be

bold and ingenious when it came to c1othes.. This is no less true,

for the male student.
Believe me, men, you’ll never get anywhere if you keep skulking

‘around in those old plus-fours. What you need is some dash, some

verve, some inventiveness in your apparel. Don’t be imprisoned by
the traditional conservatism of men's clothing. Brighten up your
appearance with a single earring, or a cavalry sabre, or a gold derby.

However, guard against gaudiness. If, for instance, you are wear-
ing a gold derby, do not also wear 9. cavalry sabi/e. This is too ‘much.

‘Wear a dagger instead, or, for informal occasions, a Bowie knife.

(Speaking of Bowie knives, I wonder how many of‘ you know
what a great debt this country—indeed, the whole world‘-owes
to the West Point class of 1836? You all know, of course, that Colonel
James Bowie of the Class of 1836 invented the Bowie knife, but do
you know of the many other important contributions to cutlery
that were made by classmates of Colonel Bowie’s’! Are you a are
for example, that Colonel Harry Clasp invented the Clasp knife‘?
Or that Colonel Harry Jack invented the Jack knife? Or that Colonel
Harry Putty invented the Putty knife? Or that Colonel Harry
Cannon invented the towel? .

By a curious coincidence, every member of the graduating class
at the U. S. Military Academy in 1836 was named Harry, save for
Colonel James Bowie. This coincidence is believed unique in the
history of American education, though, of course, quite common
in Europe.) - ' ' “

But I digress. We were talking about men’s campus fashions. Let
us turn ‘now to a persistent rumor that a garment called the “suit"
is on the verge of making a comeback. Some of you older students
may remember the “suit.’ It was an ensemble consisting of a jacket
and trousers, both of which —this’ll kill you — both of which were
made out of the same material! '

The last “suit” ever seen on an American campus was in 1941 -

. and I ought to know, because I was wearing it. Ah, 1941! Well do I

remember that melancholy year. I was an undergraduate then and
in love—hope1ess1y in love, caught in the riptide of a reckless romance
with a beauteous statistics major named Harry Sigafoos. (She is one
of the two girls I have ever known named Harry. The other one
is her sister.)

I loved Harry though she was far too expensive a girl for me.
She liked to eat at fancy restaurants and dance at costly ballrooms
and ride in high priced cars, But worst of all, she was mad for
wishing wells. It was not unusual for her to drop coins ‘into a
wishing well for two or three hours on end. My coins.

Bit by bit I sold off my belongings to pursue this insane courtship-
ﬁrst my books, then my clothes, until ﬁnally I was left with nothing
to wear but a “suit.” One night I came calling for her in this garment.

“What is that?" she gasped, her lip curling in horror.

“That is a ‘suit’ " I mumbled, averting my eyes.

“Well, I "can’t be seen around campus with you in that,” said she.

“Please, Harry," I begged. “It’s all I've got.”

“I’m sorry," she said ﬁrmly and slammed the debt.

. I slunk home and lit a Philip Morris and sat down to think. I always

light 9. Philip Morris. when I sit down to think, for their mild
vintage tobacco is a great aid to cerebration. I always light
Philip Morrises .'when I don’t sit down to think too, because
Philip Morris is my favorite cigarette, and I know it will be yours
too once you try that crazy vintage tobacco. ’

Well sir, smoking and thinking thus, my eye happened to fall on
an ad in the campus newspaper. “WIN A COMPLETE WARD-
ROBE” said the ad. “Touhy’s Toggery, the campus’s leading men’s
store, announces a contest to pick the best dressed man on campus.
The winner of the contest will receive, absolutely free, a blue hound’s

I tooth jacket, 9. yellow button-down shirt, a black knit tie, a tattersall

vest, gray ﬂannel trousers, argyle socks, and white buck shoes with
two inch crepe soles.” _

My mouth watered at the thought of such a splendid wardrobe,
but how could anybody possibly pick me as the best dressed man on
campus-me in my “suit”? Suddenly an inspiration struck me. I
seized pen in hand and wrote a letter to the editor of the campus
newspaper: _ . I .

“Dear Sir, I see by the paper that Touhy’s Toggery 1S going to
give a complete wardrobe to the student picked as the best dressed
man on campus. What a ridiculous idea!

“Obviously, to be the best dressed man on campus, you must ﬁrst
have a lot of clothes. And if you have a lot of clothes, what do you
need with another wardrobe?

“Touhy’s Toggery should give a new wardrobe to the worst dressed
‘man on campus. Me, for instance. I am an eyesore. There isn’t a crow
in town that will come near me. Three times this month the Salvation
Army salvage truck has picked me up. Esquire has cancelled my
subscription. .

“I submit that a vote for me is a vote for reason, a vote for equity,
in short, a vote for the American way.”

With a ﬂourish, I signed the letter and sent it off, somehow feeling
certain that very soon I would be wearing a complete new wardrobe.

And I was right — because two weeks later I was drafted.

Soccer Fan
Voices Opinion

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

Just last" week this desk was graced by the presence
of a letter from a soccer enthusiast who is a former member

‘of the varsity and who seems to present a valid gripe.

33.

A previously been

" sponse.

Because this newspaper strives to present student opinion as
much as possible, the following is published: '

Dear .Mr. Sports Editor, ’
Recently I read an article in one of the local papers‘"con-

cerning an All-American soccer candidate from a little school’

somewhere in the U.S. The fact that the candidate was from
Pittsburgh seemed to be his only call to fame.

But right here at the University we have a. fellow who is
in my estimation -and the“ estimation of all the coaches whose
teams he helped to defeat, one of the outstanding players in
the country today. . ,

I’m speaking of one Michael Culhane, star center halfback
for -the highly-successful Panther soccer team. Mike was born
and... raised across the sea onthe Emerald Isle where he was ac-
claimed as one of the best in Ireland‘. He made what was com-
parable to our All-American teami four years in a row and was
recently selected on the all U.S. Gaellic football team, the only
member from this district. _ I _ '4 ‘ . '

This big 230-pound stalwart seems to do his best when the
chips are down. Pitt beat'0hio State and Slippery Rock by 1-0
scores and‘ who was Johnny on the spot but Mike Culhane. With
only minutes left against Allegheny he put in the tying goal,
permitting an overtime in which Pitt emerged victorious. ’

Although his position is strictly defensive, Mike was second
in scoring with nine goals. You need no more than to ask his
teammates to discover the ability of this_'big, amiable, modest
Irishman. Let’s say we get the bandwagon and push for a
truly great All-American. = -4 '

Panthers’ “Crazylegs”

By BERNIE MORRIS

iWiednesday, December 15, 1954-—iTHE PITT  

a Court Flash -

..-.-9.,

Sports fans can daily recite the
feats of “Crazylegs” Hirsch the
great Los Angeles Ram football
star, but Panther partisans have
of late been raving about another
“Crazylegs”. He’s Charles “Crazy-
legs” Hursh, 6-4, 190-pound
freshman harwood ﬂash who is
being counted upon heavily in
future Blue and Gold basketball
plans.

The likeable Hursh passed up
offers from ten colleges, among
them Duke, George Washington,
Bucknell, and Colgate to attend
Skyscraper U. He simply says

home and liked the advantages
the University afforded him.

Currently performing for Carl
Peterson’s freshmen q u i n t e t,
Hursh has been one of the prom-
inant scorers in helping lead the
frosh to three triumphs.

Chuck is regarded as a ﬁne all-
aro " " prospect not only for his
~g ability but for his great
stency in helping to control
lg?! boards.

 Hursh attended Irwin High
School where'.he played two years
of varsity ball. There he starred

two straight years. The Knights
bested Ashley and Mt. Penn to
nail down the Pennsylvania high
school laurels. He also performed
on the baseball nine as a pitcher.
Chuck insists, though, he wasn’t
too successful in this venture.

Q ‘,
has caused the opposition many
an anxious moment.

When queried as to how he

thought the frosh would,do in
future contests “Hursh asserted,

“It’s a long season and most any-.

thing can happen, but one thing

Now if only there was a way to. boost this soccer phenom into the
national spotlight we would try, but it’s up to the coaches who select
the soccerites for country—wide mention to give Mike Culhane his de-

served praise.
