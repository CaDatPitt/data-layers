‘News’ Will Sponsor Track

llieei For Olympic Benefit

Annual I n d o o r Affair
Proceeds To Boost
American Fund

In the track house atop the Uni-
versity's own hill of “Acropolis” The
Pitt News will sponsor an Olympic
Fund Indoor Track Carnival on Sat-
urday, February 15, to aid in sending
the American Team entry to Berlin,
Germany, next summer where the
11th modern revival of the Olympic

The Pitt News Olympic Fund Indoor
Meet will be the first beneﬁt of its
kind staged in this country, being
planned expressly for the purpose of
contributing to the American entry.

Formerly, ..-this indoor festival has
gone under the name of the Freshman
and Varsity Indoor Championships,
and has been the most popular annual
University meet. This year it will
serve a dual purpose; ﬁrst, helping
the Olympic Fund, and secondly, ac-
complishing its past purpose, that of
determining indoor champions for the
winter season.

Even the competitors will pay to
take part in this affair to set out after
existing indoor records and to gra.b
off some of the ﬁrst, second, and
third place ribbons, donated by The
News, for the respective winners in
each varsity a11d freshman event.

An admission charge of 25 cents has
been set by the committee in charge
of the program. Tickets will go on
sale within the week and may be pro-
cured from members of the freshman
and varsity squads, Coaches Olson
and Potts, and sports staff of The
News.

All arrangements, including entries,
officials, the sale of tickets will be
handled by The Pitt News committee,
under the direction of Edwin H.
Beachler, chairman. It will be strict-
ly a University event with only stu-
dents conforming to Intercollegiate
qualiﬁcations being eligible for the
competition.

In interviews, both Carl Olson, head
track coach, and W. Don Harrison, di-
rector of athletics, expressed com-
plete. approval and offered to cooper-
ate with The News; in..staging the.
event. Robert X. Graham, professor
of English and head of the Uni-
versity News Service, gladly consent-
ed to be drafted into publicity work
for the meet.

Committee appointments and fur-
ther details will be announced Wed-
nesday.

Tech Faculty Member
Talks At Noon Today

Glenn Cleeton To Discuss Vocational
Outlook At Group X Meeting

Today at ﬁfth hour, -University stu-
dents will have a chance to hear just
what their chances are for getting a
job after their four years of college.
Group X, YM-YWCA organization, is
presenting Glenn U. Cleeton, head of
the department of industrial engi-
neering at Carnegie Tech, in an ad-
dress entitled, “New Facts and Your
Future.” According to Chalmers
Brown, C37, and Willard Ross, C38,
co—chairmen, the talk will be “espec-
ially pertinent to those who have not
yet decided what vocation they in-
tend to pursue in later life.”

The meeting, second in the new
Group X series, will be held during
ﬁfth period in the YMCA headquar-
ters in Room 801, Cathedral. The

meeting is open to all students.

Debating Groups
Will Hold Annual
Aﬁoir At Forum

Inquiry Forum will present its an-
nual debate by members of the two
Debating Associations this VVednes-
day at 12:30 in Room 107, Alumni
Hall.

The affirmative side of the ques-
tion, dealing with free state med-
ical aid to all, will be upheld by Mar-
ce1La Leyton, C37, and Jeannette
Swartz, C38. Israel Goldberg, C36,
and Albert Brandon, C36, will speak
for the negative.

These contests between the Men's
and Women’s Associations have been
held for a. number of years. Last
year’s debate on government control
of the munitions industry drew so
large a crowd that the debate had
to be transferred to a larger room
in Alumni I-Iall,

Katherine Monori, C36, and Ed-
ward Van Kirk, C37, are co-chairmen
of Inquiry Forum.

Miss Monori, secretary of Women’s
Debating, will act as chairman of the
debate.

F o u r S e e k Two
Festival Positions

 

Appointments Committee To Refer
Applicants To Executive Body

Petitions for the freshman dance
chairmanship numbered almost 100;
petitions for chairmanships of the
Spring Festival Week committee and
the committee for the dance number-
ed four. The four, who have already
been interviewed by the appoint-
ments committee of SFA, will go‘be-

turnout for the two positions is
claimed to be the smallest for any
chairmanship in school history.

After receiving the petitions and
hearing the claims of the candidates
last. Thursday, the appointments
committee made tentative choices or
recommendations to the executive
committee. ‘The appointments com-
mittee was under the acting chair-
manship of Harvey N. Goldstein, C3I7-,

Catholicism Is Misunderstood

By Misinformed, Says Priest

“The Catholic religion is the object
of much misunderstanding due to mis-
information.” So stated Father Pauley,
chaplain at Mount Mercy College for
Women, at the second of a series of
three luncheon-meetings at the YM-
WHA, on “Understanding Ourselves.”

Father Pauley listed several fea-
tures which make the -Catholic faith
stand as distinctive among all others:
340 to 400 million adherents in
every country on the globe; Catholic-
ity, which includes self-denial, pen-
ance, mass, and belief in Trinity;
holiness; and the apostolic doctrine.

Father Pauley suggested several of
the outstanding criticisms of the Cath-
olic religion, such as birth control,
evolution, and confession. He em-
phatically denied that the Catholic
church is opposed to ‘‘legitimate birth
control, which is really self denial.
What de do oppose is illegitimate
birth control,’ he added.

‘‘In the matter of evolution,” he
continued, “the Catholic church al-
lows a Catholic to go further than a
scientist does in this matter, but we
do say that if we have laws of evolu-

tion, God is the author of such laws.”

In commenting on the “bugaboo of,
confession,” Father Pauley continued!
that in spite of the fact that confes-I

sion is not compulsory more than
once a year, millions of people avail
themselves of its advantages several
times annually.

In concluding, he added that “this
country is over-run with broadminded
people, people broadminded enough
to accept ideas of anybody on the
question of religion. If one is trou-
pled with a question on Catholicism,
he should ask a Catholic, and like-
wise with other faiths. Much mis-
understanding is spread by those who
tI‘Y to interpret the faiths of others.”

Father Pauley denied that the Cath-
olic faith is losing its hold on youth,
and attributed the possible loss in
other faiths to lack of a central au-
thority, to correspond to the Pope.

In response to the question, “Does
it not take a great deal of faith to
believe in Catholicism?” Father
Pauley responded: “Atheism, agnos-
ticism, and materialism demand great-
er faith than do Catholicism, Protest-
antism, and Judaism.”

On Friday, Dr. Solomon B. Free-
holf, rabbi at the Rodef Shalom Tem-

ple, will interpret Judaism. John
Baker, BA38, will preside, and a
string trio will provide a musical

background during lunch, as it did
at the last meeting.

‘Tickets for the next meeting can
be secured from cabinet members of
the YMCA, the YWCA, the YM-WHA,

and from members of the Newman
Club, cnmbined sponsors of the
series,

University Plans
Adjustments For
Damage Of Fire

Class Schedules Are Rearranged;
V/"ill Bear Losses Sustained
By Chemical Students

Offices of the department of chem-
istry in Thaw Hall, were a scene of
feverish activity Friday, following
in the wake of the disastrous ﬁre
which Thursday evening destroyed
the Mines and Mineralogy building,
in which the chemistry laboratories
were housed.

Students asking questions about the
loss of equipment, chemicals and sup-
ply cards, were assured by Dr. Sil-
verman in classes Friday that every-
thing would be replaced within due
time.

Officials had not yet determined the
origin of the ﬁre, and, pending further
investigation, declined to make any

further comment as to the amount
of damage. Dr. Alexander Silverman,
head of the department, announced
that all classes were to be relocated.
The schedule of classes and the rooms
appears elsewhere on this page.

In the Trees Gymnasium about 350
feet away from the Mines and Miner-
alogy building, 40 women students of
the WAA were attending a banquet
when the ﬁre broke out. Miss Eliza-
beth Rearick, of the department of
physical education had upon leaving
the Gymnasium noticed that the sec-
ond ﬂoor of the Mines and Mineralogy
building was ablaze.

Firemen had difficulty in ﬁghting
the blaze, due to inadequate water
pressure and the combustible chem-
icals. Many indicated that if the
wind had been blowing in the opposite
direction, the ﬂames would have un-
doubtedly reached the University car-
penter shop and print shop.

Onlookers at the ﬁre called it as
spectacular as a ﬁreworks display.
The sky was painted a ﬁery orange
red, and at intervals small explosions
were heard, followed by spurts of
vari-colored ﬂame into the sky. The
heat was so intense that ﬁremen
were unable to come closer than a
distance of almost ﬁfty feet.

The watchman who makes {he
rounds of the buildings in the vicinity
of the Stadium was not due at the
building until 9 o’clock. The ﬁre was
discovered at 7:45 o’clock.

All surplus chemicals of the depart-
ment of chemistry were stored in the
Mines and Mineralogy building, ac-
cording to Mr. H. F. Easly, custodian
of supplies for the department.

Engineers’ Club Plans
Programs For Term

At their last meeting, the execu-
tive officers of the Thursday Engi-
neers’ Club, headed by Frank Lawton,
E37, drew up plans for the program
to be presented at the regular ﬁfth
hour meetings next semester.

According to Lawton, the club
hopes to prepare a program that
would assure speakers ten weeks in
advance. The programs will include
outstanding ﬁgures in the Pittsburgh
engineering world. The president also
issued an invitation to all students
enrolled in the School of Engineer-
ing to sign the club roster.

Because of examinations, there will
be no meeting of the Engineers’ Club
next week. The next regular meeting
will be held the ﬁrst Thursday of the
new semester in the conference room
of the YMCA headquarters, Room 801,

Cathedral.

Enrollment Record Set
For Pre-Regis tration

Following an all-time record day
for pre-registration, Friday, the
total enrollment for the second se-
mester amounted to 2,503. From
9 until 5 o’clock Friday, no less
than 557 students passed through
the registration proceure.

A total of 3,504 classiﬁed stu-
dents are registered for the com-
ing term, although Saturday class
registration ﬁgures, expected to
swell the total, were not available
at press time.

Registrar; J. G. Quick announced
that late registration will continue
all this week. The registrar was
greatly pleased by the number of
early registrants, claiming that the
edge has thus been taken off mass
registration.

Dance Committee
Names Andrews

SAE Becomes Business Manager
Of Greek Valentine Day Dance

Philip Andrews, M36, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, was named business mana-
ger of the Interfraternity Ball at its
ﬁrst committee meeting Thursday.

The affair, scheduled for the eve-
ning of Valentine Day in the main
ballroom of the VVil1iam Penn, will be
a dance which, according to Frank
Frederick, C36, Theta Chi, chairman
of the committee, “beats them all.”

“And I went to the Junior Prom,
too,” Frederick continued.

Speaking seriously again, Frederick,
through his mouthpiece, Al Dixon,
BA36, Delta Tau Delta, promised a
good band, a Greek Valentine Day
motif, a dance hall which I-F Council
unanimously approved, and, in gen-
eral, an Interfraternity Ball which
would go down in the annals of Inter-
fraternity Balls. ,

Other members of the committee
chosen Thursday includez, George
Harris, C36, Lambda Chi Alpha; Mor-
ton Lewis, C37, Pi Lambda Phi, and
Joel Janvier, C38, Kappa Sigma, on
the invitations body.

with publicity.

Speaker Outlines
Entrance Tactics

Registration With Law Examiners
Is Necessary For Applicants

At its ﬁrst meeting of the new
year, John Marshall Club, honorary
pre-legal fraternity, heard James B.
Blackburn, professor of law, outline
procedure for admission to the Uni-
versity Law School.

Speaking in the Y Conference
Room. 801, Cathedral, Mr. Blackburn
emphasized that all undergraduates
who plan to enter Law School next
September must register with the
State Board of Bar Examiners, at
1632 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia,
before graduation.

Upon application to the board,
blanks are supplied to the applicants,
such blanks to be ﬁlled out by the
lawyer with whom the student intends
to work out his clerkship. It is also
necessary, according to Mr. Black-
burn, to signify before February one’s
intentions of entering the University
Law School next September.

The preceptor, or practicing law-
yer, is responsible for the student’s
six months clerkship before he be-
comes eligible for the State Bar exam-
ination. It is not neccessary, Mr.
Blackburn emphasized, to present a
diploma when completing preliminary
registration, but a student must sub-
nut a transcript of his grade record
upon graduation in June.

The purpose of registration with
the State Board before graduation,
Mr. Blackburn stated, is to fulﬁll re-
quirements of State laws governing
Bar examinations, which stipulate
that a student must register for tak-
ing the examination three years be-
fore the exam is given. Exams are
given in the last week in July.

During its regular business meet-
ing, the Club, with Frank Reich, C36,
presiding, laid tentative plans for its
annual midyear tapping. In addi-
tion, it was decided to discontinue ar-
rangements for a proposed all-city
conference, preliminary to the Inter-
collegiate Conference on Government,
to be held in II-Iarrisburg, April 24-26.
The Club pledged its whole-hearted
support to the State-wide Conference.

YM- YFVCA To Discuss
Program At Joint Meeting

Next semester’s program will be
discussed by the YM and YWCA cab-
inets in their joint meeting tomorrow
at 12:30 o’clock in Room 801, Cathe-
dral. The March Intercollegiate Con-
ference, Dr. Henry Crane’s visit plan-
ned for February 17, 18 and 19, and
the Easter worship services will be
discussed.

University Bebaters To Meet

Stanford Ch Network Today

Racltoff, Seder
Head Committee

For Student Polls

To investigate student opinion on
subjects of campus and national inter-
est, the executive committee of SFA
last week appointed a sub-committee
to act in accordance with the motion
passed at the assembly meeting Tues-
day, which provides for conducting
surveys and polls.

Leonard Seder, C37, and Herbert
Rackoff, C38, were chosen as co-
chairmen. Others who will be asked
to serve are R. F. Blackburn, assist-
ant professor of statistics, Elizabeth
Black, BA36, Courtland Leigh, C37,
and William Blair, C37.

A ﬁrst, unofficial poll was taken by
Seder and Rackoff on the question of
the elimination of ﬁfth hour classes.
Each student interviewed was asked
this question: “Are you in favor of
the elimination of ﬁfth hour classes?”
Answers were recorded as “yes,”
“no,” or “indifferent.”

Of the students interviewed:

"(-3.7 per cent answered “yes.”
15.7 per cent answered “no.”
10.6 per cent were indifferent ,

Interpreted statistically, these ﬁg-
ures show that the number of students
in favor of the. elimination of ﬁfth
hour classes lies between 2,456 and
3,007.

According to Seder, it is a practical
certainty that these ﬁgures are cor-
rect. ‘He says, “Rackoff and I made
our studies and surveys independent-
ly, and found that we were within one-
tenth of one per cent of being iden-
tical, The department of mathemat-
ics wasgamazed at the accuracy of
this correlation.” _

Seder attributes this success not so
much to the committee which made
the survey, as to the science and tech-
niques of statistical procedure which
make it practically impossible for an
unbiased andcorrectly-taken survey
to return an inaccurate result,

Questions which the committee will
begin to study after the beginning of
the second semester include that of
the ideal dance price, and the ques-
tion of the sale of tobacco on campus.

McQuade Announces
SFA Dance.Committee

Series Will Be Directed By Woman,
Two Men From Each Class

For -SFA’s 1936 tea dance, a com-
mittee of two ‘men and one woman
from_ each class has been appointed,
announces William McQuade, E37, so-
cial chairman ofthe organization. All
classes will now be efficiently contact-
ed, McQuade says.

The committee is composed of Lou-
ise Kelly, E36, Howard Lutz, BA36,
and William Hughes, C36; Alice Lew-
is, E37, Elmer Schriber, BA37, and
Edwin Beachler, C37; Lucy Conn.
C38, Paul Kohberger, C38, and Jack-
son Sigmon, C38; and Mary Camp-
bell, C39, Bernard Cashdollar, BA39,
and Bernard McKenna, C39.

The aim of this year’s dance is to
make the series established campus
social affairs.’ The committee will not
work to make them outstanding ﬁnan-
cial successes but rather pop-ular
breaks in the social setup.

Although place, time, and price
have not as yet been decided, a meet-
ing of the committee in Room 801,
Cathedral, this afternoon at 3:30
o’clock will include discussion of de-
tails and formulation of plans.

4-5-Minute Broadcast
To Originate Over
WCAE At 4:15

The power of the “nine old men”
who are the Supreme Court to declare
that statutes of Congress are unconsti-
tutional has been "both approved and
condemned. Critics of the court main-
tain that the members read their own
political and social philosophy into
their decision by usurped right; ad-
vocates of the status quo question the
advisability of allowing a governing
body to pass laws unchecked and un-
restrained.

A. student viewpoint of the limita-
tion of the court’s privilege, now much
in the public’s mind because of the
recent nulliﬁcation of New Deal meas-
ures, will be thrashed out over a na-
tion-wide National Broadcasting Com-
pany hook-up this afternoon at 4:15
o’clock by debaters of Leland Stan-
ford and the University.

The debate will be on the topic:
Resolved, that Congress shall have the
power by a two-thirds vote to over-
ride decisions of the Supreme Court
making legislation of Congress uncon-
stitutional. .

Representing the University in its
ﬁrst national radio debate will be
Frank Doeringer, C36, and James
Eichelberger, C38, who will take the
affirmative side.

The negative will be argued by
James Reynolds and Gilbert Holloway
of Stanford. They will speak from
San Francisco.

The debate, to last 45 minutes, will
begin from Station VVCAE in Pitt
burgh with the ﬁrst affirmative speech
by Eichelberger. He will talk for nine
minutes, after which the scene will
switch to California for the initial
negative of Reynolds.

Doeringer and Holloway will then
present the second affirmative and
negative views, respectively. Doer-
inger will conclude with the last re-
buttal, after "Hol1oway’s' rebuttal
speech. —

There will be no chairman or deci-
sion. The speakers will be introduc-
ed by a staff announcer.

Conference Delegates
Meet For Discussion

Presidential Platforms To Be Topic;
Students Invited To Attend

 

The University delegation to the
Intercollegiate Conference on Govern-
ment will meet today in Room 202,
Alumni Hall, at 3:30 o’clock. At this
time, several members of the delega-
tion will discuss the platforms of all
political parties of the presidential
campaigns of 1924, 1928, and 1932.

The aim of the conference this year,
according to VVilliam Stark, C38, tem-
porary chairman of the University
group, is to study these platforms
with an eye toward formation of a
model platform at the state-wide con-
ference. The conference will stage a
model political convention, including
nomination of presidential candidates,
and drafting of a model platform.

The group is open to interested stu-
dents, Stark added, and all are in-
vited to attend.

Williams ‘Loops The Loop’

021 Aviation F or Engineers

By Sam Williams

According to Major Al Willia.ms,
world famous aviator, in his speech
to the AE-ME seminar Thursday,
aviation can be divided into two
classes, the physical characteristics
and the attitude of the public toward
the industry.

The fact that there are many
things created by nature that man
cannot duplicate has little to do with
the theme of his talk but it was in-
teresting to hear that experience, level
ground for airports, and the aging of
liquor can not be synthetically made
to any degree of satisfaction.

The future of the seaplane is bright-
or than that of the land plane, said
Major Williams, because it is possible
to land and take off the water without
any concern over restricted space op-
erations such as experienced by land
plane pilots.

Transoceanic ﬂights, although at
present valuable only because of the
scientiﬁc data they yield, will soon be
of great commercial value. Major
\Villi-ams believes that such routes
will create the necessary incentive for
the designing of larger and more
elaborately equipped seaplanes, be-
cause it is this type of ship that is

‘most practical for ocean ﬂights.

Instead of the 60,000 pound planes
that are considered the latest thing
in aviation, there will be “seaplanes
beyond present conception,” these sea-
planes, which he predicts will be built
before'1937, will probably Weigh about
150,000 pounds and will be equipped

with showers, berths, and “all the
comforts of home.”

A scramble for trade routes equal
to that of the 15th and 16th centuries,
with nations battling for “rights,
privileges. and prerogatives,” as they
seek control of the air routes be-
tween key cities, is anticipated in the
near future.

The ruling passed lately by the de-
partment of commerce prohibiting
citizens from using the radio beams
for personal blind ﬂights was dis-
cussed in length by Major Vvilliams.
Although his stand was neutral, he
told of protest meetings and present-
day Patrick I-Ienrys who are stirring
up much fuss because of the ruling.
Although he believes that this re-
striction hampers the progress of a
ﬁeld still in its pioneering stage, he
said, “VVe must carry people ﬁrst be-
fore we let people carry themselves.”

Foretelling the weather has improv-
ed greatly. At one time, Major VVi1-
liams nicknamed them “the anti-air-
craft boys” because they kept every-
thing grounded. However, recently
they were able to tell him within ten
minutes of the time he would strike a.
storm.

It is his belief that a radical change
in aircraft motors is necessary. The
present type of motor, especially the
radial one, presents too much wind
resistance. He pointed a ﬁnger to-
ward autos parked outside and said,
“The motors out there under those
hoods are exactly the same as present
aviation motors.”

Student Strife

The student recreation room at Marquette is being
picketed. A couple of coeds entered to spend a few
pennies on the whiﬂles tables and came out with ﬂat
pocketbooks. They quickly organized and are now pa-
rading signs bearing-_the following inscription: “This
joint is unfair to organized_whifflers.”

part of ‘the University’s
mineral collection. owned by the
geology department. More than 4,000
rock specimens, valued at $2,000, lie
buried beneath the charred ruins of
the old chemistry laboratory.

The minerals destroyed belonged to
‘the Wadsworth collection of geologi-
cal specimens, which had been pur-

“If any; of the material is retriev-
ed,” said Mr. Leighton,. “it will be
practically worthless, for the ident_i-
fying labels have burned, even though
the rock would not. We have no way
of knowing now in what particular
region of the earth those various
rocks were found.”

Just before the Christmas holidays,
Mr. Leighton decided to have the min-

Mermen Triumph
Over Delaware

In ESA Contest

Lindberg, Locke, Jones Play
Leading Roles In 38-30 Win

Over Plucky Eastern Club
Captain Russ Lindberg,
Panther swimmer,
the opportune moment on Friday eve-
ning to give the varsity natators a
hard-earned 38-30 victory over Dela-
ware University’s underrated outﬁt.

With the score standing at 33-27 in
Pitt’s favor going into the last event
on the program, the Panthers needed
at least a second place in the 100-yard
freestyle to make victory secure. For
the easterners Coach Bardo had
selected two of the fastest sprint men
in the Eastern Swimming Association
for his entry, Marty Howard and John-
ny Carey. Coach Corr was relying on
Lindy and Harry Geyer.

Earlier in the evening Howard had
nosed out Lindberg in the 50-yard
sprint to create a mild upset, and
when Howard and Carey remained on
even terms with Lindberg for three
laps in the century event, it appeared
as though the Panthers would be
lucky to pull down a third place. How-
ever, the Pitt captain put on a little
extra steam in the ﬁnal 25-yard leg to
beat Howard and assure his team a
victory in its initial league encounter.

Co—starring with Llndberg was Tom
Locke, who romped away with a cou-
ple of triumphs in the 220 and 440-
ya.rd events. In the quarter-mile race,
Locke almost succeeded in lapping
the ﬁeld twice. His time for the
longer stretch was 5 minutes, 25.6
seconds, while he negotiated the fur-
long freestyle in 2 minutes, 29 sec-
onds. _

McQui|lan Wins Diving Contlest

In the fancy diving, Red McQuillan

sounded his return to competition,
after a couple of week's layoff, with a
clean-cut win. Hymie Swartz, Dela-
ware, took second honors followed by
George Myers of Pitt.
. Joe Jones had to wait until his last
year as .a varsity competitor to pay
back a debt of two years’ standing.
For the past. couple of seasons, Bill
Croes, Delaware star, has forced Jones
to be content with second place
laurels .in the 150-yard backstroke
when the two clashed, but the tables
were turned on Friday with Jones
forcing Croes to be satisﬁed with sec-
ond place.

Sonny Kenworthy turned in a vic-
tory for the visitors in the 200-yard
breaststroke to give Delaware its
only other first place of the meet.
However in spite of their lack of ﬁrst
places, the Delaware lads caused the
Panthers a lot, of trouble by monopo-
lizing second and third places.in the

. majority of events. .

In the Pitt freshman-Turtle Creek
dual, the yearlings swamped their
youthful opponents with a 46-13 drub-
bing. Walt Nowotny made Coach
Corr’s hopes for next season jump up

a few points by bettering the varsity’s ,

time in the 100-yard freestyle event.

V\'alt did it in 57.4 seconds as com-

pared with Lindberg’s 57.8 seconds.

Georgetown Beats
Pitt Cagers, 43-42

Beaten In Extra Period Thriller;
Louck’s Field Goal Disallowed

Did Loucks sink a ﬁeld goal before
or after the ﬁnal whistle blew? That’s
the question the Pitt varsity ﬁve
would like to have answered by a ju-
diciary. The officials of the Pitt-
Georgetown cage struggle last Friday
evening decided in tlie negative, and
as a result the Carlsonmen were nosed
out in an extra period thriller, 43-42, to
suffer defeat No. 5 for the season, de.
feat No. 2 in the league, and defeat
No. 3 on a losing streak.

The regular game endedin a 35-35
deadlock, and it took a last—minute ral-
ly by the Panthers to make it that.
With 90 seconds to play, Pitt trailed
by a count of 35-29. Then Jesko, Gar-
cia, and Spotovich came through with
ﬁeld goals toleven up the count.

In the extra period, ghals by Petro-
sky and Nau sent the II-loyas off to a
good advantage, but goals by Garcia
and Roderick and a foul shot by John-
son allowed the Pitt men to forge in-
to a 40-39 lead.

Bassin and Petrosky added a trio
of points, and Johnson’s two-pointer
made the score 43-42. Then came
-Loucks’ goal which officials claimed
was thrown in after the whistle had
blown.

The Pitt boys played rings around
their conference opponents in the ﬁrst
half, leading them 21-12 at the end
of the period, Then Georgetown, re-
membering that it hadn’t beaten the
Panthers for some time, imitated Car-
negie Tech and Notre Dame to go wild
and win the ball game,

Bill Jesko and Spotovich led the
scorers for the Golden Cats with 11
and 8 points respectively, while Petro-
sky with 11 and Bassin with 10 were
tops for the Hoyas.

There were comparatively few fouls
called in spite of the heatedness of
the action and the length of the game.

Titan, Mountaineer Tests
Pfrecede Exams For Cagers

Panthers Battle Titans
Here On Wednesday;
Bennett’s Back

Final exams or no ﬁnal exams. the
Panther cagers suffer no let-up in
their schedule during this period of
“hell week,” and this week ﬁnds two
strong opponents coming to visit the
Stadium and the Panthers, Westmin-
ster’s towering Titans and West Vir-
ginia’s Mountaineers.

Wednesday will ﬁnd VVestminster
here with, as usual, another ﬁne team.
In the last seven years John D.
Lawther, coach of the Titans, has
helped his cage teams to a record of
148 victories against 28 defeats; This
season, after a faltering start that
saw the Titans break even in the ﬁrst
six games, Lawther has had his team
fall back into stride, winning the last
six games.

Headlining the Titans’ visit will be,
of course, the district and Eastern
high scorer, Wes Bennett. A senior,
Bennett again leads the scoring col-
umn this season, having averaged al-
most 15 points a game ever. since he
began college basketball. VVes is six
feet, four inches tall, deadly on all
shots from any angle of the floor, and
is again a‘rea.dy being mentioned
for a position on the~Al1-American.

Supporting_ Bennett, Lawther has
ﬁve of his last year’s varsity back this
season. Paul Backus, John Krivosh,
“Swede” Hunneke, and John Willits
form the starting ﬁve along with Ben-
nett. Hunneke and. Willits are two
of the best players in the district.
The team as a whole averages a
height of six feet, two inches, giving
the Westminster team a. distinct ad-
vantage over the smaller Panthers.

Last season, the Panthers and the
Titans met at the Stadium in the only
game played between the two teams
during the 1934-35 season, with the
Panthers handing Westminster one of
its three defeats of the season, 38-32.

Mountaineers ‘H-ere Saturday

After the Westminster game, VV‘est
Virginia trots on the Stadium ﬂoor
next Saturday night in an Eastern
Intercollegiate Conference battle with
the Panthers. Here. again, most of
the starting players on the Mountain-
eer ﬁve have been seen on the Stadi-

|um floor in previous years and again,
the Nlountaineers loom as the team to
whip if the Panthers want another
conference title. Yet there's Big" Joe

Stydahar, “Red’ Gocke, and several
others who say it’s a Mountaineer
year,

Last season, the Panthers met the
Mountaineers three times. They split
the ﬁrst two games, tying for the
league honors, but in the play-off, the
Panthers romped to a lop-sided 35-22
victory. At present Vvest Virginia and
Temple are tied for the top in the con-
ference while the Panthers ribernate
in third _place.

In both games of the week, the
Little Panthers will play the prelim-
inary to the varsity games. Wednes-
day night they face a district-high
school ﬁve, while Saturday evening
they play the VVest Virginia freshman
team.

Varsity Natators
Face Busy Week

Meet 'I'eacher’s Outﬁt Tomorrow,
Carnegie Tech On Friday '

Before meeting up with their ﬁnal
exams, which may or may not lick
them, the varsity swimmers will com-
pete in a couple of dual meets this
week.

Tomorrow, the team will journey to
Slippery Rock where it will face the
Teachers outﬁt, and on Friday after-
noon Coach Corr’s aggregation will

gagement with the Skibos.

F'o7lowing that meet, the swimmers
will be inactive until February 15,
when Penn State will be encountered
at State College. ‘On Washington's
birthday, Pitt will bump into F & M
in Pittsburgh, and a week later, Feb-
ruary 29, will exchange splashes with
the cadets at West Point.

Two more trips to New York, one
on March 7 to face lvlanhattan, the
other a week after to participate in
the Eastern Swimming Associatioﬁ
championships, will bring he natators
to the ﬁnale of the swim season, the
‘Pitt Interscholastics on the 28th of
March.

Freshman W omen
Select New Names
For Activity Units

Pantheriters, Qtuesters, Scripsits,
Sportalites To Report Plans
At Council Meeting

Freshman women’s units will havei
plenty to report in their council meet-’
ing Thursday, at 3:30 o'clock in Room
102, Alumni Hall. New projects will
be brought up and discussc-il. and the
new names of the units will be report- 5
ed.

The publications unit has ﬁnally
chosen the name “Pantheriters.” after
discussing a group which included
such names as “Tile Pi-ttwits," and the
“Co-editorettes.”

The publications unit received,
along with their new names new as-
signments, involving interviews, and
heard their last assignments critized
by Sally Harris, C36, unit adviser.

The freshman acting unit elected
themselves the “Lambda Deltas,"
after their name committee, compos-
ed of Florence Miller, chairman,
Doris Vegan, and Elsie Ekstrom, had
turned in a list of names. The name
translated means “Love of Drama.”

2 Together with the dramatic discus-
sion unit, the Lambda Deltas heard
Carl B. Cass speak on “Acting and

joint dinner also, to be given before

At the Friday meeting of
Dorothy
Davis and Edith Gerenstein read
original poems. At the last meeting
Placas and Edith Goren-
stein read some of their own selec-
tions.

“He who seeks shall ﬁnd"-—at least,
this is the contention of the mem-
bers of the freshman science unit.
They have chosen the imposing title
of “'l‘he Questers” which they believe
signiﬁes the purpose of their organ-
ization.

On Thursday, January 23, Dr.
Lotte O. Lohstoeter, assistant pro-
fessor of modern languages, will ad-
dress the unit on “The Relation of
Science to Other Fields.” The meet-
ing will be held at 2:30 o’clock at
Heinz I-Iouse.

 

Activities Group
To Collect Data
On Forum Topics

 

Although the Annual Leaders Insti-
tute is still some time off, members
of the VVSGA activities committee
are looking ahead to that event. The
job of planning the Annual Institute
is new confronting Mary Frances
Brice, Ed36, and her committee.

Suggestions submitted to the com-
mittee at a recent WSGA commission
meeting were to the effect that some
brief training in parliamentary pro-
cedure would be of value; that the
place of a committee member might
be discussed; and that a forum, with
outstanding members of the faculty
would be of interest.

Two years ago at Leaders Insti-
tute, such a. forum was held with
prominent faculty representatives
giving their viewpoint on the value
of extra-curricular activities and the
place they should have in the life of
a college student.

The activities committee would
welcome suggestions from any under-
graduate woman as to what should
be discussed at the affair this spring.
It is fol‘: that problems that have
arisen within the personal experience
of any woman participating in activ-
ities would be of value in deciding
the trend of discussion at the Insti-
tute.

123 University ii’/‘omen Contribute Free
Time To Settlement House Instruction

 

Seniors in the School of Education
are not the only students who worry
about practice teaching. Twenty-
three University women spend much
of their spare time instructing class-
es, clubs, handicraft, and recreational
sports groups at settlement houses
throughout the city.

These women receive no pay for
their services. “We enjoy it,” they
insist. “VVe are not martyrs at all,
and we gain valuable training in so-
cial sel"-rice work and in education.”

At W’oods Run Settlement, Lois
Bigge, C38, assists teachers in a civic
D1‘0jeCt, showing the children, by
means of a. model village, what the
perfect city shoud look like. Juan-
ita Carpenter, Ed37, gives piano les-
sons at the same settlement, “At
least ten women are needed to do
work that these two are attempting

to accomplish,” state settlement ex-
ecutives.
Irene Kaufmann Settlement is

somewhat more fully supplied with
student workers, with different settle-
ment clubs being led by Jeannette
Kaminsky, C37; {Ruth Resenthal, C38;
Minerva Reiter, C37; Roberta Truby,
C3; Sylvia Schwartz, C38; Sylvia
Shapiro, C39; Cecelia Maloney, C36;
Sally Hochhauser, Ed36; Beatrice
Cohen, C37; and Ruth Lazirovit-z, C36.
All these clubs are left to the indi-
vidual initiative and leadership of
their instructors.

More workers are still needed for
teaching handiwork, and taking
charge of children’s playrooms and
neighborhood visiting.

Soho Settlement has a varied sched-
ule. A glee club is conducted by
Helen Akerman, C38, a.nd Rose Anne
Boer, C37; a cooking class by Beulah
Confer, C38; gymnasium work by Eliz-
abeth Reed, C39; and dancing classes
by Jane Schmidt, C38, and Beverly

Basketball Teams Eat

in Trees gymnasium, sponsored by
the lVomen’s Athletic Association.

There were about 40' out to prac-
tice. The freshman sports unit, as
guest of '\VAA, was divided into two
teams. Sophomores and juniors play-
ed a series of practice games, all
refereed and umpired by physical edu-
cation majors.

Dinner was served at 6 o’clock. [Hot
dogs, baked beans, pickles, olives, ice
cream, and cocoa were on the menu.
After dinner everyone lined up to play
“Going to Jerusalem.” It was inter-
rupted by the beginning of the chem-
ical laboratory conflagration. The
group hurriedly adjourned to watch
the ﬁre.

Childress, C38. A handcraft class in
which the students have already made
yarn dolls and wall pictures is in-
structed by Myrtle St. Clair, Ed36.

The present workers at Brashear
Settlement House are Katherine Par-
rish, C36, who instructs an art class;
and Marie Binder, C36, who takes,
cliargc of a club group at the Negro}
center. In February, the settlement’
is hoping for new aides, in dramatics,
knitting, and social folk dancing.

Peggy Gray, C37, is working in the
library at the YVVCA Chatham House.

At the Munhall Settlement, Grace
Kovacs, C38, leading a club of girls
between the ages of 11 and 12. has in-
structed them in cooking and handi-
work; has helped the girls to make
puppet dolls; and has conducted seine
sewing lessons. Lucille Parker, C38,
conducts a club of 12-year-old girls,
who are interested in programs and
games.

Ruth Sharp, Ed37, leads a club of
high school sophomores; and Sylvia
Schwartz, C38, edits the settlement
newspaper at Munhall. This sheet
informs people in the immediate
neighborhood of the projects of the
settlement.

Students who can act as leaders for
children’s games, story telling, regu-
lar clubs, and rhythmic dancing are
needed for February. Any students
interested in helping in any of the
settlements may see Miss ‘Helen Bat-
trick, executive secretary of the
YMCA, or may approach the Social
Service Committee of the YWCA. The
members of the committee are: Mary
