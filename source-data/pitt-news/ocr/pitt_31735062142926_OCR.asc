Burnett Lauds Young Writers

iMag Editor Says
, Youth Best Time
To Experiment

by Bill Catrow
Feature Editor

Rambling humorously about the
topic, “Writing and Writers,” Whit
Burnett shared provocative opin-
ions, suggestions, and anecdotes,

gleaned in a career as author and

editor, with the near—capacity au-
dience at the Thursday evening
meeting of the annual Western
Pennsylvania Conference for Writ-
ers.

Margaret Cousins, managing
editor of Good Housekeeping mag-
azine, preceded Mr. Burnett with
criticism of Pi-tt entries in the
Doubleday creative writing con-
test and information about the
-requirements and policy of Good
Housekeeping.

Story in ‘Red’

Famous for discovering and de-
veloping young writers, Mr. Bur-
nett edits Story magazine, a pub-
lication' which has lost money
since its ﬁrst issue in Vienna in
1931 and its transfer to the United
States under the auspices of Book
of the Month and Random House
in 1933. ‘

Mr. Burnett expressed his en-
thusiasm for the stories of post-
war writers whose varied exeri-
ences and vivid imaginations, have
given their works “a sense of ob-'
jectivity, judgment, and balance.”

_Citing the axiom, “When you
are old, you are very old; when
you are young, be youthful,” Mr.
Burnett urged aspiring writing
students to write and submit their
manuscripts while “they have the
youthful audacity to express their
thoughts and experiences sincere-
1y.» \

Youth Will Gamble

According to Mr. Burnett, youth
is the only period in life when
writers will gamble; maturity

brings with it responsibility and .-

caution which stiﬂe realism and
honesty.

Mr. Burnett is credited with dis-
covering William Saroyan, Gladys
Schmi-“tt, Mary O’Hara, and Jesse
Stuart and placing their stories
before the reading public.

Eve C. Sends
Bestto Dean

Miss Helen P. Rush, dean of
(women, received the following
letter last week from Eve Curie,
author and lecturer who address-
ed the women of the University
at the annual Women’s Day cere-
monies in April.

May 14, 1947
Dean Helen P. Rush
Dear Dean Rush,

So many thanks for your kind
letter and thepictures. You are a
busy woman and it is nice to have
taken the time of sending them
to me. -

Believe me, it has meant a great
deal to me to come to Pittsburgh
and Women’s Day and to get this
wonderful welcome. I hope we
shall not completely lose track of

‘each other and will get to meet

again, lecture or no lecture.
Mademoiselle Curie.
Yours sincerely,
Please, give. my best wishes to
the girls, whom I liked very much.

Smokers Can
Now Come Out
Into the Open

Instead of furtively sneaking a
smoke under the forbidding “No
Smoking” signs in the second and
third ﬂoor corridors, the inveter-
ate Pitt addict may now enjoy his
weed with the full blessing of the
University.

Previously, smoking was per-
mitted only in the small smoking
rooms off those corridors, though
by no means conﬁned there. Due
to the inadequacy and inconveni-
ence of the smoking rooms, as
well as the routine violation of
the fast fading signs, by students
and instructors alike, the deans,
at long last instigated a move to
repeal “Pitt’s prohibition.” This,
however, constitutes the only
change in the smoking laws.

Smoking still is deﬁnitely taboo
on the ﬁrst floor and in all
classrooms, regardless of time, ac-
cording to the venerable Mr.
Daufenbaugh, head of the Pitt
marshals. Mr. Daufenbaugh, by
the way, “gives very few inter-

 

Enlarged Corps Number
To Exceed 600 by Fall

by Frank Langsdale, News Reporter
The Reserve Olﬁcers Training Corps at Pitt will be sup-
plemented by a unit of Engineers and Quartermaster Corps
next fall according to a recent directive from the \Var De-

The Quartermaster unit will be recruited primarily from
the School of Business Administration while the Engineer unit
will be comprised of engineering students only.

Colonel John I. Hincke, Professor of Military Science and
Tactics said, in announcing the addition. “The activation of
an Air Corps unit has been requested, but the Air ROTC course
would not include pilot training. It would have to be taken, if
desired, after graduation from the University.”

Col. Hincke also stated, “Instruction in the present Coast
Artillery Corps unit will be

widened to include training in
Anti-Aircraft Artillery, Seacoast
Artillery, and Field Artillery.”

, The Military Department at
Pitt Was ﬁrst established in 1918
when 1,500 students enrolled in the
Students Army Training Corps
and the University erected build-
ings to house them, becoming in
effect, an Army training camp.

During the period between the
two wars much interest was
shown in the ROTC and a total
enrollment of 800 was reached
and maintained.

The_present' unit has a strength
of 457 members and expects an
over all enrollment of approxi-
mately 620 with the advent of
the new units.

men trained in the ffngineering

Uniforms in Vogue for Dances

Veteran’s Memorial Ball

Planned for May 29

Veterans and their guests polish the brass on
their uniforms or straighten“ their bow ties for
the Veterans association ﬁrst Memorial ball, and
head for the main ballroom oflthe William Penn
hotel on Memorial day eve for four hours of danc-
ing to the music of Bob Rhodes and his orchestra.

Business manager Ken Sakraida urges stu-
dents to remember that “the dance is an open
aﬁair.”

Bob Rhodes will be remembered as the “Babe”
Rhodes who was popularly featured with Baron
Elliot’s orchestra several years ago. Tickets for the
Memorial ball are on sale at the ground booth
every day at $3 .per couple. ‘

Proceeds from the ball will be transformed into
a living memorial for the Pitt men killed in World
War II. Their families will receive beneﬁts ac-
cording to the amount of proﬁt~ realized at the
dance. Similar events for the solidiﬁcation of a
permanent memorial fund will be held each year
by the PVA.

Mary Giesey, chairman, promises an evening
full of entertainment for all students, and adds
that “B. O. Plenty is taking Gravel Gertie.”

 

Military Ball Closedito All
But Cadets and Guests

A semi-official bulletin received through chan-
nels from an unidentiﬁed source in the fourth floor
HQ of the Pitt ROTC today denied previously un-
conﬁrmed rumors that General Eisenhower was to
be guest of honor at the Corps’ Military Ball Sat-
urday, May 24. '

The statement also branded as false reports that
ﬁlm star Betty Grable would be present at Syria
Mosque accompanied by Secretary of War Robert
Patterson.

An additional communication received from the
Ball’s public relations officer, Bill Lytle, stated
that the dance, not to be confused with the Vets
Association Memorial ball on the 29th, will be
attended only by University corpsmen and their
guests. Beginning at 8 p. m, the dance will con-
tinue until midnight to the music of Maurice Spi-
ta1ny’s orchestra. .

A notation to the latter communique initialed
by Scabbard and Blade head James D. Finley con-
ﬁrmed an earlier statement that the military fra-
ternity would tap new members duning the Mili-
tary Ball’s intermission.

712a Men @d7ecl'

Men’s Council is perturbed. At a meeting last week, the
members of this august group, in representing some 8000
men students on the campus, lodged a complaint with the
Pitt News. ,

The complaint centers-about the women on campus, and,
particularly, the women’s governing groups. More exact is the
complaint against the way that the News has treated articles
concerning these governing groups. “'

It seems that we have referred to women’s class ofﬁcers as
just plain “class ofﬁcers.” We are in error in stating them as
such.

Men’s council, in the motion to advise the News of its
error, asked for a general clariﬁcation for the student body
of all things “student governing.” In as brief a way as possi-
ble,'we hope that the following helps. .

The men on Pitt campus have one group, and one alone,
which acts as their representative in the student governing
ﬁeld. This group, Men ’s council, acts as a medium between
the student body in general and the faculty and administra-
tion. It hopes, in carrying out its responsibilities, to improve
the lot of men students. i

The counterpart of _Men’s council on the women’s side, is
\Vomen’s Self Governing association. WSGA, with its judicial
unit, senior court, settles all problems of the women students.

But, in addition, the women elect inieeach class, a, complete-
. cabinet’ to maintain close coordination, between class members.

These “little units” are peculiar to the women--the men have
nothing similar, nor are they aﬁected by actions of these
groups. ~ -

To the men of the Council: when we refer to “class ofﬁ-
cers.” we mean “women’s class ofﬁcers.” We thank you for
your interest, and hope that we may keep that straight in fu-
ture articles. -

Advertising  
Exams Given

Pitt students who aspire to careers
in advertising will be given an op-

iﬁcations in this ﬁeld.

A day-long general aptitude test
will be given in Pittsburgh on
June 7, followed by a test of

ing on June 14. These examina-
tions, sponsored by the American
iAssociation of Advertising Agen-
cies, will cover all major divisions
of advertising agency activity
. . . contact, plans, merchandis-
ing, research, advertising rates
and media, copy writing, mechan-
ical production, radio production
and advertising layout and art.

Interested students may apply
between today and May 29 by
writing to the Pittsburgh AAAA
Examination Plan Committee. Box
655, Pittsburgh. Application forms.
instructions, a list of typical ques-
tions and a booklet on the struc-
ture of the advertising business
will be sent to all prospective
candidates.

As a guarantee of sincerity, a
registration fee of $15 is required
from each accepted applicant. This
is to cover the costs of giving the
examinations. According to Henry

ing committee, no assurance of
employment can be given to can-
Vdidates who successfully pass
these examinations, but it is ex-
pected that many will be helped
-to obtain employment in agen-
cies.

The tests are reported to be dif-
ﬁcult; they require inherent inter-
est in the advertising ﬁeld if they
are to be/successfully passed. This
type of test is a further guarantee
of sincerity of the applicant.

This is the ﬁrst of regular an-
nual examinations by the Ameri-
can Association of Advertising
Agencies. Through this activity, it
is planned to seek closer coopera-
tion between agency men and
those teaching academic advertis-
ing courses.

pondered a second and said: “I
think we got an awful lot out of
the practice—the only thing
wrong was that there were too
many guys getting hurt, nothing

ruin the eﬁectiveness of the train-

“What about spirit? Can Mil-

with Fesler?” He answered this
one immediately. “Fesler used
mainly psychology on as, Mike
is practical and to the point-—in
the long run I think that's a bet-

He shied away from trying to

1 mor e games

Artman than the Pitt
squad but their record is not much
better. In six matches the Buck-
eyes have copped only two match-
es. Those two wins were in the
ﬁrst two games of the season.
They are currently riding on the
crest of a four-game losing
streak.

Ohio State’s number one man is
Gordon Conklin; who with third-

man Arnie Levenstein is the -only
racqueteer that has been winning
with anything resembling consist-
tency. Besides Conklin and Lev-
enstein, Coach Wirthwein will
probably use Tom Mitchell, Dick
Cole, Jack Pickering, and Len
Schiﬁ. Austie Rosenthal, Irv Tob-
kin, and Marv Slessinger will be
held in reserve.

Coaches O’Iaughlin and Artman
are expected to send the same ar-
ray of men against the Buckeyes as
they have been planning to send
into the last seven frays. Stan
Well is top man on the squad at
present. He is followed by Bob
Bald, Ellsworth Horn, Russ Camp-
bell, John Clinton, Jack O’Brien,

V and Art Harmuth.
