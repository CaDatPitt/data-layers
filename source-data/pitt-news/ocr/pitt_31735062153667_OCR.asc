nitrogen fertilizer, as a labo -saving de-
vice, is proﬁtable in Flande Vwhere the
cost of farm labor’ is only a fraction of
.what it costs in the United States, ‘then
why do We not. use .-such fertilizer as

‘ In a game abounding in the time-

tional tension,‘ the Seniors Tc-elebrated
their_ departure from the University.
by’ troun cing I the ‘Faculty -T in}, their an-
nual game on Trees,-Stadium_L‘la'.‘st Mon-L
day aftern-oon by the decisive ‘score of
9 to T3. . The faculty presented. their
most formidable array, including in
their ranks all the old-timers and 311',‘
clent stars to beraked -up from the
teaching ranks,lbutLthe younger sen-
iors easily overcame their most per-
si»stenLt, opposition and Tpérched se-
curely on the long end of ‘Lthescorie.
Thefaculty battery ‘made up‘““as good
‘a pair as ‘ they have ever possessed,
and several“ times prevented additional
scoring on the part of "the seniors by
clever work. Graham Tpitched a fair
game for the departing ones, and was
ably assisted by his teammatesin the
T. B. Morgan was a con-
spicuous ﬁgure, oﬂiciating respectively
as umpire, ﬁelder andL score keeper.
The faculty are not convinced that his
decisions were not tinged with par-
tiality and are seriously cTonsldering

with Abel L. Klaw as assistant. The
greatest loss suffered by the monthly

‘paper is the retirement of Louis
