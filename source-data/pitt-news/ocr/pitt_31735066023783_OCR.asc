The proposed Early Incentive
Retirement Plan, originally
approved by the University Senate
Health and Welfare Committee last
spring, was discussed ‘at a_v Pitt
faculty assembly meeting Monday.

The proposal includes a pension
scale for members based on their
years of service at the university.
Under the plan, only -full-tir_ne
faculty and faculty librarians who V,
are at least 62 years old would be
eligible to participate. The decision

‘to retire early would be the faculty

members choice.

Pitt‘s Women’s Center wilfremain

year, according to center director
Cynthia Vanda. \.

The center was informed by a let-
ter from Chancellor Wesley Posvar
on Dec. 22 that 'university funding
will continue until fiscal year I982.

The decision was made after the
Office of Continuing Education for
Women (OCEW), was‘ awarded a

People's” Trading
Blood and Bodies

 .;F or Easy Money

By Bill Hess

Pitt News Staff Writer

Looking for a unique way to make

, some extra money? If being paid $10

for spending two hours lying on a
couch with a needle sticking in your
arm sounds appealing, you might
want to check out Oakland’s Sera-
Tec Biologicalsi whose business is
plasmapheresis.

According to Dr. James Crispen,
medical director of the firm, Sera-
Tec obtains plasma from donors and
sellsjit to pharmaceutical firms who
often then use the plasma to make
drugs. But Crispen said, certain risks

exist in the procedure.

“We’re required by the Food and
Drug Administration to provide
informed consent of these risks
before a donor can actually be
allowed to participate in the pro-
cess,” Crispen said. He added that
the worst thing that could possibly
happen is death of a donor.

“But this is true in all types of

. medical procedures,” Crispen said.
“In the 20 years that l’ve been in the
business, l’ve never heard ofanyone
dying from a plasma donation, and
no one has ever died from a,dona—
tion at a Sera—Tec facility.”

Student Government’s Legal
Awareness Committee supported
Crispen’s claim.

“We havcn’t heard of any prob-
lems’ with Scra—Tec from any Pitt
students,” said David Minesky, a
spokesman for the committee. “lf
someone were to get sick. they’d
have to prove that it was Sera-Tec’s
fault, whether it be because ofa dirty
needle or something else along that
line."

Eating. An essential. parjtof each]

Pitt student’s daily routine. At
lunch time,‘ the mad rush to the

to

cafeteria begins. But not allstud‘enti,s -

rely on thefood provided for by the"

university dorms; there are alterna-
tives to the cafeteria. W "
One such place is the Jewish Com-
munity Center, located at 3 l 5 S. Bel-A
lefield Ave., where" meals are
provided by B’nai Brith Hillel.
Rabbi Joseph Levine, director of
Hillel, said that although lunches
and dinners served at Hillel are.
strictly Kosher (in "accordance -with-
Jewish dietary laws), you do, not
have to be Jewish to use the dining"
facilities. _ * '

“All of our programs are open to.

everyone regardless of race, color,
religion or creed,” Levine said.

. Rabbi'Joe, as he is known to all of
Hillel’s members, said he believes
the dining area is like a home away
from home for many students.

Different meal plans are offered
to those who want to dine at Hillel.
Lunch and dinner are served daily
with ﬂexible schedules for those‘
with late classes, " according -to
Levine. - '

Sam‘ Gershonowitz, president of
Hillel, extended an invitation to eve-
ryone who at least wants to try what
is being offered at Hillel. Gershono-
witz said that those whocheck out

Left Holds Its

DC. where America's right wing
greeted the incoming president. The
scene was Pitt’s Student Union
Lower Lounge Monday night. as
Pittsburgh’s leftist community had
one last "fling before the aging ex~
movie actor took office.

The Counter-lnaugural Ball‘,Vl7Z_iT§
organized by Larry. ‘Eyaftsiaﬂnidi Eric
Leif Davin. It was made possible by
the money and efforts donated by
members of over a dozen area pro~

" gressive organizations. While some

serious political activity took place,
the emphasis of the celebration was
simply a good time.

A stage show emceed by Anne
Feeney provided entertainment. A
variety of local musicians appeared.

interspersed with cutting political.

satire by the Mighty Mill Hunk Art
Players and others. The presenta-
tions included such characters as a
saxophone~playing Ayatollah Kho-
meini, a snout—nosed Alexander
Haig draped in the American flag.
and Mr. and Mrs. Moral Majority.

The highlight of the night. how-
ever. was the party-goers them-
selves. All.dolled, up in various
inaugural outﬁts, the hundreds in
attendance were in high spirits as
they imbibed in beer and wine. The
group celebrated the arrival of the

Hostages

‘tried to complete an agreement with
Iran on Monday, but as the hours
slipped away, Carter was deprived
of a chance to greet the hostages
before he left office.

Thus, the reported freedom for
the Americans—50 men and two
women——coincided with the end of
the Carter presidency as power was
transferred to Ronald Reagan at
inauguration ceremonies in
Washington.

The hostages were seized Nov. 4,
1979 by young Moslem militants
who stormed the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran. They said the hostages
would be released if ‘the United
States handed over Shah Moham-
mad Re’/.a Pahlavi, then undergoing
medical treatment in the United
States. The shah found refuse in
Egypt and died in Cairo on July 27,
1980.

Release of the hostages would end
14'/2 months of negotiations, Ameri-
_can economic and diplomatic pres-
sure, and the failed attempt last
April to send American commando
teams to Tehran to free the hostages
by military action.

The 52 Americans the

remaining hostages from among 98
seized by the Moslem revolutionar-
ies nine months after the Islamic
revolution in Iran.

The hostages include diplomats,
Marine guards, communications
specialists, teachers and a business-
man. They range in age from 20 to
64. About 20 are servicemen.

The final push toward a settle-
ment came in weeks ofintense nego-
tiations with Algerian diplomats
acting as intermediaries.

On Dec. I9, 731‘e-Iranians
demanded that the United States
deposit $24billion in cash and gold
Algeria ‘as a “guarantee” that Iran’s
financial demands would be met,
including its demand for the late
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s
wealth. I

The United States rejected this,
and on Jan. 2 offered a counter-
proposal: only the approximately
$10 billion in Iranian government
assets frozen by the United States
would be returried, in installments
linked to arrangements for resolving
claims and counter-claims by the
two sides.

On Jan. 7, Iranian negotiator

,d’Affaires

Behzad Nabavi said Tehran “gener-
ally ’ accepted the latest proposal,
and the next day Deputy Secretary
of State Warren Christopher flew to
Algiers to establish closer contact
through the Algerian go—betweens.

Afterthe failed commando opera-
tion last April, the Iranian militants
announced they had scattered the
hostages to more than a dozen Iran-
ian cities to forestall another rescue
attempt. _

Late last year, unconfirmed
reports mounted that the Americans
had been reassembled in Tehran,
and later that most had been put ina
former resort on the Caspian Sea
and others at Revolutionary Guard
headquarters in Tehran.

Throughout most of the crisis,
three ofthe hostages—led by Charge
Bruce Laingen-
remained in custody at the Iranian
Foreign Ministry. But in early Janu-
ary the Iranians reported the three
had been moved from the ministry
to another, undisclosed. location.

was stormed by 300 to 400 youhg

Each day a staff of three volun-

prepare the food, which consists of
soup. sandwich, salad, dessert and a
beverage.

“Its a nice balanced meal. . .It’s

A wide variety of people dine at
the Center, according to Lutheran
campus Pastor Paul Sampsell.

“Both students and community

If this is true, then the thought of Reagan and hisstaff
entering the White House is a frightening one. Throughout
the campaign, and during the Senate confirmation hearings
for cabinetappointees, the recurring theme has been one of
aggressive determination to return America to her rightful ’
place on a. global throne. -

With those-words, and in the space of one hour, an era has
come to an end. It began with Kennedy, ran through J ohn-
son, civil rights, the Viet Nam War, Nixon, Watergate, Jerry _
Ford, Iran and Jimmy Carter. Columns in several newspap-

7 ers have suggested that Reagan model- his administration '-
after that of Eisenhower, and indeedthe mood of America,
at leastas it is perceived by "the media, is one of nostalgia for
those wistful days of yesteryear. -

This attitude will place us in one _'potential_lran after
another, and considering the extent of global tension and:the
nuclear capacity, of the super-powers, there is very little

' ' t oura e America and its _ _
It is a dangerous mistake o enc g mom for such blundenng

new president that the clock can be turned back to the heady
era of “the American Century.’ We are a great nation and a
powerful force in the world, but to believe that we can now
return to a role of world policeman and moral arbiter is
absurd.

Our perceptions and our goals as a nation must consider
the extensive effects of our acts on the rest of the world. If we ‘
are to achieve anything resembling peace and security for
ourselves, then we must act to establish peace and security
for the rest of the world. We must start by scrapping our old .
and distorted views, and seek to develo a new and more

accurate picture of what goes on in the world and what our
place in it should be. i  - -

The conditions that created the hostage crisis in lran are
still in place. We st-ill expect the rest of thelworld to pay
tribute and stand in awe of America the imperious, America
the eternally correct. ‘

The clock cannot be turned back, and America cannot
take its place on a global throne. We do have a role to play
and a contribution to make in the world community. It is up.
to the American people to let Reagan know how this new
role is to be shaped. /

The ‘view in Washington, among the new movers and
shakers in the White House, is that we only need to show
more muscle to achieve greater respect. But so long as ‘our

, banks, multi-national corporations, and quasi-fascist client-
“ states around the world maintain their apparatus of control’

 Graduates with Not Job’
 Can Blame Themselves

 I To the Editor,

Mr. Collins, in his column in The

Pitt News, Jan. 14 I981, got a good

point across to the freshmen and

sophomores who are confused

about what they will do with their

lives after an education at Pitt. That

point is that they should not have the
same attitude as Mr. Collins.

It is outrageous for Collins to sug-

gest that it his responsibility to tell

' freshmen and sophomores that the

work they pursue in just about any

i " field will be “useless“ or somehow

indicates_that they are “boring“ or
“jocks.” lsthis some kind ofjoke? lf

' it is, it does not say much for Collins’
responsibility. Collins could be
expressing his frustrations about not
being able to ﬁnd a job. It is not

 surprising he cannot find work with
 (‘an "attitude such as the one he
‘ .,-_ex'p_resses inhis, column.

H; is

l admit that it is not easy to sue-
ceed in planning your future but I
am not going to give up that easy. I
have appplied to medical school but
lam also making contacts and look-
ing into related fields just in case. I
am doing this because 1 am going to
get ajob in the field 1 want no matter
how hard I have to work for it.

l know that Pitt students can get
lost and waste their time but that
does not make an education useless.
These people must look at them-
selves and take on a better attitude.
If I were a freshman, I would not
heed Collins‘ warnings. Rather, I
would work as hard as I could and
get my money's worth out of Pitt
because when it comes around to
getting a job, that company isgoing
to look for young people who are
hungry to achieve something and’
williiigto work. Thatfsjwhpat I would

 
 

lncidently, the spark that started
me writing ‘was the fact that my
father is a plumber and l did not like
Collins’ statement that plumbingis a
“mindless technical field." My
father would not have a job if he
were as} mindless as Collins.~ My
father, after coming home from the
war. sold newspapers and did other
jobs to pay his way through techni-
cal school. Only apersoin who
wants towork hard to better himself
can do that.» It cannot be done by
someone who is mindless and criti-
cizes another man‘s'field of work.
My father never went to college but I
know that he is smarter and more
responsible than myself or Collins.

So I say that any senior who can-

_ not find a job has only himself/ her-

self to blame no matter what his/ her

No Goool Friday Vacation’)?

To the Editor, .

I was disgusted to read the article
in the January l4th issue of the Pitt
News concerning-the SGB’ers “wee-
kend junket to Monroeville". I find
it appalling that student _activity fee
revenue, which I am forced to sup-
plement with my tuition, is used so
that student government members
can enjoy a weekend of luxury at a
hotel.

I feel that this money should be
channeled into programs that
benefit as large a portion of the stu-

dent body as possible, instead of‘

being used so that the select few can
enjoy a little vacation. It seems very
peculiar to me that so many of our
student organizations are not given
all of the funding they request, but
there happens to be an extra $1600
available for this-so called seminar.

However, what
pointed me was The Pitt News’
rather nonchalant reporting of this
event. The university newspaper’s

responsibility is tor represent the_

common student’s interest and, I
must admit that in the past, I have
been fairly well pleased with the
manner in which the editorial staff
has handled this responsibility. But
in this instance, I feel that you have

really dissa-I

sold us out.

I cannot understand why the SGB
didn't just use the offices that they
are supplied with in the student
union for their meetings. Student
activity fee revenue should be used
for real student activities and I feel

” that The Pitt News should have

expressed this opinion in the article.
At least now I can see why so
many members of the SGB used an

Sociobiology: Never Question

To the Editor: —
STOP SOCIOBIOLOGY AT PITT

This pamphlet with this title —
printed by the International Com-
mittee Against Racism—was
handed to me by one of my students
just before we went to the first
meeting of my graduate seminarz.
Sociology and Education. I assume
that I am one of those to be
“stopped.” Professor Gaulin -
anthropology - is away this term so it

appears to be my responsibility to-

respond.
I am not a sociobiologist, biolo-

A,‘ gist or anthropologist, but rather

one who works mostly with those
planning to become school teachers
or professors of education. My
majorjob is to attempt to get profes-
sional educators to understand‘ the
larger picture of education in its
social and historical setting and its
philosophical premises. 1 am, there-
fore, very much ‘concerned with
human development and behavior,
especially in groups. I have studied
and read extensively in anthropol-
ogy, biology, and sociology for the

This particular attack on sociobi-
ology is wrong - absolutely mistaken
- in every assertion made regarding
sociobiology, but quite correct in the

charge of racists using sociobiology ‘

to promote their own sort of hate,
fear and frustration, and demon-
strate their near-total ignorance.
Some of their behavior, especially
the KKK and most military estab-
lishments, do reinforce some of the
explanations E._O. Wilson and oth-

\ ers would "predict on the basis of

involved in the Committee Against
Racism—generally good people,
igenuinely committed, although I I
doubt if they can have much effect
on contemporary students who are
-more concerned with getting into
law, medicine and engineering, and
faculty who are afraid of losing their
jobs.

There is no “racism" or even “bio-
logical determinism" involved in
sociobiology. Sociobiologists do
not claim that our behavior is “prim-
arily” determined by our genes, but,
some of it is, or at least inﬂuenced by
our evolution. Sociobiology does
not say “give in to the inevitable.” It
is a controversial subject. It is not
wholly new but it is now backed by
massive-—almost overwhelming—~
evidence, not simply conjecture of
theory—but fact! .

That we, as a ‘species, should
somehow be exempt from some
degree of instinct o_r genetically
determined behavior, is terribly
arrogant—and naive. « We are

- primates—animals—with millions

"of. years of evolutionary adaptation,
with billions of bits of genetic mate-
rial in our bodies. Evolution is not
theory. It is fact! Only the very

 to-ignorant are still trying to fight that .

century-old battle which denies the
fossil record, the human brain upon

another from reptile to human and.

our own embryonic development
which abbreviatedly reminds us of
our origins. '

Certainly people who want simple
pat answers to problems will resist
any ideasor research which suggest
complexity. Marxists believe that
humans are perfectaibleg Conse-
quently, they prefer that we are born
tabula rasa—-blank slates—so that
all our behavior is culturally learned
and can therefore be reprogrammed

 TheRight To Study It

for a Marxist society. Behaviorists
have held the dominant position in
our university, and society, for the
last several decades. .
Religious groups prefer their own
“revealed truth" literary interpreta-
tions of human origins which make
us unique and special instead of
simply a‘ dominant species which
ruthlessly destroys or subjugates all
other species and often our own as
well. Some feminists would prefer
to minimize the differences between
the sexes, which is odd considering

that nature favors females in most

respects.
Fortunately, the founders of our

I society were realists. ‘They did not

believe that humans would basically
change but rather that we would
always be prone to selfishness,
deviousness and greed. So, they.
devised a form of government pur-
posely constructed so as ‘to check‘
these tendencies, to control and con-
tain them—not to vainly attempt to
radically change them. So far they
have been correct in their basic

' assumptions".

I suppose that most people would
like to deny that we are animals, that
millions of years of evolution—of

~adaptation—-have somehowgleft us

free of that long past. Sociobiology
merely reminds us that we are not
exempt. We have consciousness and
so /we can indeed alter—and to
alter—our behavior’, often defying
what natural selection or gene pres-
ervation (The Selfish Gene) mnight
dictate. “In fact, our preoccupation
in this short life is to defy and alter
our genetic heritage. 

Yet our children are not born

“civilized” humans. They are—at
birth——essentially,.the same as the
young of our ancestors a million or

The Panther gymnastics team fin-
ished first in a three team field at
Towson State last Saturday. Pitt
won with a total score of 242.5, as
opposed to second-place finisher
William and Mary (240) and third-
place Towson State (227.l). The
Panthers were dominating despite

the close scores as they won every
event except the sidehorse.

In the floor exercises, Pitt's David
Smith (9.35) and Bob Besong (9.3)
finished first and second. These were
the highest scores registered by the
two Panthers. According to coach
Frank D’Amico, Smith and Besong
are strong possibilities for
Nationals.

“Bob and David will hopefully
qualify for Nationals," said
D’Amico. “Its still early in the sea-
son and every score will count. But
they have a chance to make the top
six.”

In the ring events, Pitt once again
‘took the top two places with David
Schandelman (8.9) and Besong
(8.85) leading the way. Besong went

on to win all—around with a totaliof

50.3 points. Frank Kratz finished
third for Pitt in all—around with 49.7.

The Panthers took first places in
three other events, Kratz (9.6) in
vaulting, Besong in T-bars (8.5) and
H-bars (9.05). The only weak event
was the horse where Pitt’s Joe Femi-
ani finished second with an 8.5. The

Panthers Fall 62-60  

PittFa1'ls to Score

in Final Three Minutes

By MIKE UICHIARA
Pitt News Sports Editor

The /Pitt Panthers, fresh off a big
86-48 victory over Delaware State,
entered the Providence Civic Center
knowing that the Rams were a far
cry from their previous opponent.
The two teams were tied for second
place in the Eastern Eight standings

with 3-l records; a win would keep '
,,,Jhe victor in contention for first

place. In a well-played game, the
Rams defeated the Panthers by a
score of 62-60. .
Pitt controlled the tempo of the
game early as they led by scores of
2-0, 4-2 and 6-2. Dwayne Wallace
,and Lennie McMillan led the Panth-
ers early in scoring, ending up with
l4 and 10 points, respectively, in the
first half.
» Pitt continued their fine offensive
display from Saturday night by
shooting a good 58 percent from the
floor and 70 percent from the foul
line. With 12:55 remaining in the
first half, Pitt took a 14-10 lead on
the strength of a McMillan jump
shot. Two minutes later, the Pan-

thers increased the margin to seven
points, l7-l0, by continuing excel-
lent outside shooting to diminish the
effect of the Rhode Island pressure
zone defense.
Wallace hit ajump shot a few min-
utes later to keep Pitt ahead by a
score of l9-l3. Sam Clancy, who
had only two points in the first half,
had to sit out the last seven minutes
of the half because he picked up his
third personal foul.

With a big offensive and defensive
threat on the bench, Chipman sent
in Paul Brozovichand put him in the

_ center of a 2-1-2 zone defense.
Rhode Island then caught fire and
tied the game at 23 in what was now
a transition basketball game. The
game was tied once more, this time
at 28, with about four minutes left to
play in the first half. The Panthers
then broke the Rams’s zone for three
straight points and with two minutes
remaining, Steve Beatty drove the

The I98] edition of the Panther

I track team promises to be an impres-
sively strong unit. Pitt showed some

of its power in New York last Sun-
day afternoon at the Syracuse Invi-
tational. Although no team score
was kept, Pitt-‘certainly would have
been among the top three finishers.

lane and hit a lay-up. He was fouled
and completed the three-point play
to give Pitt a 35-32 lead.

Pitt pressured the Rams into
another mistake and scored, then
with less than 10 seconds left, Beatty
got a rebound and fired ‘down court
to a waiting Wallace who sunk the
shot at the buzzer giving Pitt a 39-35
halftime advantage.

the Panthers came out ofthe lock-
erroom ready to play basketball and
they quicklygextended their lead to
six, 41-35. Wallace scored his 16th
point of the game on a jumper to
increase the Pitt lead to,45-35, the
biggest of the game. The lead alter-
nated between eight and 10 points
for the next few minutes as both
teams scored each time they had’ the
ball. ’

Clancy~ then took a feed from
Wallace with about l3 minutesileft
in the game to give Pitt the ten point
Lead, 5l-4l. Rhode Island then
began to chip away at the lead and
managed to whittle it down to six on
the strength of a Jimmy Wright
jumper.

With the score 53-47, Pitt, Chip-
man called a time-out to try to settle
his team down. The next time the
Rams had the ball, Wright was
called for a charge for his third per-
sonal foul ofthe game with Pitt lead-
ing 57-49 with l0:46 remaining.

Both teams then began going up
and down the court in a quick
transition-type game. Rhode Island
took advantage ofa John Ryan tur-
nover to score a three-point play by
Wright. He drew the foul from
McMillan, his thirdof the game, as
he banked the ball offthe glass to cut
the lead to 57-54.

the Rams continued the pressure
and Wright scored again to give
Rhode Island nine unanswered
points to trail by one, 57-56. On the

present Wright stole the ball from

The Pantherette hoopers have

(‘strung together nine victories,

their latest being a 76-74 win over
Northwestern. This is the longest
winning streak in the history of
Pantherette basketball. The pre-
vious record had been eight, set
(during the 1979-80 campaign...
Pitt, 13-2, must now face one of
their toughest opponents of the
season, Maryland, tognight in
College Park.

Northwestern led most of the
entire contest. The Pantherettes
were struggling with ‘two major
problems in the opening 20 min-

1‘ 9
.-«utes. One was Northwestern s for-

ward, Julie Callahan. Callahan
pumped in 17 points by halftimeto.
lead the Lady Wildcats to a 44-35
edge at intermission. Pitt also had
foul trouble, which would come
back to haunt them in the second
half.

Twelve seconds into the second
half, Pantherette Pam Miklase-
vich was slapped with her fourth
personal foul. One minute later,
teammate Gail Aughburns joined
Miklasevich on the bench for the
same reason. '

“l’m sure Northwestern felt that
getting our starters on the bench
was a key to their victory,” said
coach Judy Saurer. “Lynn Love
and Lori Arent came offthe bench
and did an excellent job for us,
though.”

At the 18:29 mark, Callahan
converted two free throws, giving
Northwestern their biggestrlead of
the second half, 51-41. Thé Pan-
therettes buckled down in the next
five minutes, allowing Northwest-
ern only one bucket. Meanwhile,
Pitt used the time to close the gap.
Lori Dolby hit two jumpers,
Penny Welsh scored on a lay-up,
and Lynn Love tapped in an errant
shot. A Carol Dugan layup at the
13:36 mark pulled Pitt within two,
53-51.

Northwestern answered -with
three quick baskets of their own,
building the lead back to eight.
Debbie Leviiis went to the bench
for a short rest, and the move even-
tually paid off. Saurer also
inserted Aughburns and Miklase-
vich back into the lineup with
about 10 minutes remaining, and
the Pantherettes began to con-
struct the comeback of the year.

Down 65-58, the Pantherettes
again starved the Northwestern
offense from the 8:14 mark to 3:41,

when Callahan hit both sides of a-

one-and-one. During this time
span, Debbie Lewis went on a tear.

Starting with a jumper from the?
top 01 the key, Lewis followed with
two driving layups. With 4:25
remaining, Lewis stole the ball and
hit a third layup, giving Pitt a 69-
65 lead. Northwestern could not
recover fast enough, and the 76-74
victory was preserved.

In a switch from more recent
games, the Pantherettes won the
game with fine shooting. Pitt hit a
hot 51.5 percent for the game,
holding a 34-26 edge in field goals.
The hot hands turned cold when
they went to the free—throw line.
though, as the Pantherettes shot a
poor 38 percent in that category.
The game also marked the resur-
gence of Pitt’s stingy defense.
Northwestern, hampered by the
blanket coverage of the Pan-
therettes, shot only 25.6 percent
from the field in the second half,
and only 35 percent for the game.

Penny Welsh and Debbie Lewis
each scored 21 points for the Pan-
therettes. Welsh also pulled down
11 rebounds. Northwestern was
led by Callahan with 33 points.
Amy Prichard contributed 13 and
Laura Augustyniak added 10 tal-
lies in the losing cause.

Pitt will face a team tonight that
they have never beaten, the Mary-
land Lady Terps. Kris Kirchner,

the Terps All-America center, has 1

transferred to Rutgers since the
Pantherettes faced them last.

The Pantherettesgdefeated Northwestern 76-74 for their ninth straight win this

season.

The Pitt grapplers dropped to 3-4
with losses to Millersville State and
Lehigh University over the weekend.
The Panthers must now prepare for
the Kent State Invitational this Sat-
urday and Sunday. Pitt will face
Bowling Green in the first round of
action. The tournament is a new
concept in college wreslting, calling
for entire teams to move into the
winner’s o'r loser‘s bracket, instead
of individual wrestlers.

Millersville outscored the Pan-
thers, 20-l5, for the win'Saturday

Fast action, hard checking, and
well-executed plays play a major
role ‘in any hockey game. All of
these elements were present in Sun-
day’s game in which Pitt and CMU
skated to a 5-5 tie.

Right from the, outset, one was
able to notice that the contest was

going to be a very physical one.
Time after time players were seen
throwing checks around.

In the first period CMU domi-
nated the play by forechecking effec-
tively against the Pitt club. Sloppy
play by both teams was quite evident
during the opening period. Because
of this, plays were not executed
effectively. ‘

Though CMU scored_ the first
goal early in the contest, Pitt
regained control and Dan
Konieczka drove in a goal that
evened the contest.

With two men in the penalty box A.

for CMU, Pitt used their powerplay
very effectively by scoring their fifth
goal early in the second period.‘ The
scoring play, originating as a shot on
goal from the point, hit the goalpost.
Tom Robinson was there to get the
rebound and sent the puck home.
The amount of action in the

second period surpassed that ofthe ‘

previous period. Checking and
more forechecking by both club
was a common sight. *
CM U35 momentum toward the

scored two goals to even the score.
The fast-paced period ended with

The third period was scoreless as
both teams were looking for the light

- at the end of the tunnel, only to find

as

no escape. It was the play of both 3‘

goaltenders in the final minutes that ‘
held the teams off the scoreboard.
Pitt’s ‘Robinson had the best
chance to end the deadlock as he was
sent in alone on CMU's goaltender,
but was not able to place the puck
into the net, as a great save was
made. 3

Coach Jim Nelson felt that the
team didn’t play to their full poten-
tial, and he hopes the team will work
harder the next game.

CMU's coach Archy' Winer was

‘proud of his club's performance.

“Pitt playeda good game, too.l
But, in view of the traditional .
rivalry,‘ I guess it was a victory for
us,” he said. The players on the
CMU hockey club felt the game was
a “moral victory.” ‘

Pitt students Steven Marﬂzen. a
politics and philosophy major from
Ann Arbor, Mich, and Michael
Alberty. a speech communication
major from Portland, Ore. won 20
of the 2| debates intwhich they par-

history of the California Swing.

Attaining such a record demands
time, hard work and collaboration,
according to Alberty.

including time spent traveling, said
Alberty. a transfer student from
Oregon’s Lewis and Clark College
Alberty remarked on the closeness
of the 20-member debating union.

“it's like a small, tightly knit fam-
ily," Alberty said. “Anybody can
start into it (debating), because it is a
lot less elitist than getting into
sports."

Marzen said he came to Pitt
mainly for the debating union. He
said Kane held a workshop on
debating at his high school in
Michigan.

“I find debating an incredibly

rewarding experience. because it
develops both communicative and
research skills," Marren said.

Kane then explained high school
debating experience is not required
for the debating union.

“A common misconception is that
you should have had high school
experience to debate in college, but
that isn't true," said Kane, a debate
director at Pitt for 14 years.

“The Union can be ‘broken down
into novice, junior varsity and
national teams with both regional
and national competition,” he
explained. “I think debating is a very
important activity, because it is the

    Ta1<esFirst incontest

only one that allows intellectual
competition. it is a chance for the
very bright students from Pitt to
compete against the very bright stu-
dents from Harvard.“

Kane added that ‘Vice President
Mondale was a successful debater
who believed being on the debating
team was the most meaningful part
of his education for “it gave him the
opportunity to learn to think
quickly.”

The’next tournament for Pitt will
be in early February at Dartmouth,
Kane said. The year_will culminate
with the National Debate Tourna-
ment in April, according to Kane.
