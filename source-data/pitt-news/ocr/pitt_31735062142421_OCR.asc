Pitt Ends Season Tomorrow

ny JERRY RIPP

Determined to salvage at
least a little glory from a sea-
son laden with heartaches and
unexpected d e f e a t s, Pitt's
football Panthers take o-n the Nit-
tany Lions from Penn State tomor-
row afternoon down at State Col-
lege in the season’s ﬁnale for both
teams.

Where the State eleven has had
another successful year, Pitt has
had an equally unsuccessful sea-
son. With only one loss and one

V tie to mar an otherwise perfect

record in seven games, the State
team can look back over their rec-
ord with satisfaction. The Pan-
thers, on the other hand, have only
three wins in eight contests and
can look back only on what might
have been.

Tomorrow afternoon’s clash will
ﬁnd‘ both teams using freshman
players freely. For the Blue and
Gold Walter Cummins, Frank No-
vak, Bob Cattrinella, George Wat-
Bon and Bob DeMar will see plenty
of action. State has been using its
first year men all season and have
found a standout among them in
halfback Larry Joe. Joe was one

. of the big cogs in the upset scored

by State over Penn last Saturday.

Since the Great Lakes game,
where the Panthers nearly scored
what wou-ld have been the upset
‘of the year, the Blue and Gold
have been anything but a good

Ufootball team. Even in winning
last week against Nebraska the
Bowsermen were ragged and only
the fact that the breaks came their
way saved t-hem from another loss.

Advanced juniors who will gradu-
ate from the 1943 summer tri-

mester will be included in the
graduating senior section of the
1943 yearbook, James Hardy, C44,
circulation manager, declared to-
day.

Graduates of the 1942 summer
semester seniors who will gradu-
ate in January and May, and juniors
who will graduate from the 1943
summer trimester all must have
their pictures taken at Gimbels
studios no later than Tuesday,
November 25. No extension of time
will or can be made as the con-

tract to take senior pictures at Gim-
bel’s studios will expire on that
date.

Decision to include 194-‘3 sum-
mer graduates was taken so that
those students could obtain the
book with their picture in it be-
fore they graduate rather than a.
year later as is the case with this
summer’s graduates.

A deposit of two dollars may be
made in the Owl office, 803 Cathe-
dral, at the booth .in the ground
ﬂoor elevator lobby, or with any of
the 35 senior salesmen. A $2 deposit
must be made before a picture will
be taken at Gimbel’s studios.

Drive Here

Commended

Comparative ﬁgures on the
faculty and student contribu-
tions to the Community and
War Fund drives for the past
three years were released today by '
J. G. Quick, University registrar.

The totals for the three years
are as follows: 1940, $9,948.44;

"1941, $10,511.78‘; and 1942,’ $13,-

160.25 has been collected to date.
This 1942 total includes only the
money taken by November 13. It
already represents an increase of
$2,648.47 or 25 per cent over the
1941 total, and an increase of

$3,211.81 or 32 per cent over the
1940 subscription. ‘

No quota was given to the Uni-
versity this year, but the quota
for the other two years was
$10,000. This year the school
adopted the motto of the down-
town drive, to “Give Double.”

Student totals for the three
years are: 1940, $2,596.59; 1941,
$3,011.53; and 1942, $3,554. The
faculty totals are: 1940, $7,-
351.85; 1941, $7,500.25, and 1942,
$9,606.25.

“It is a record to be proud of,"
said Mr. Quick. “and every‘ con-'
tributor should be complimented.”

Effects of Total War

Interested students and faculty
will meet with Dr. Edgar J. Fisher
of the Institute of International
‘Education on Tuesday from 12:30
to 1:30 in 1232 Cathedral. Discus-
sion at the meeting will center on
the affect of the war on students.

Dr. Fisher is a member of the

eral Committee and is very well
informed about the work of the
Fund in various parts of the world.

Frosh Receive

Panther Keys
December 11

Honor Court, the traditional cere-
mony honoring freshmen, will take
place on December 11 instead of De-
cember 4, it was decided at the
Men’s Council meeting this week.
At this assembly, attendance at
which is compulsory for all three
freshman classes, Panther keys
will be awarded to freshmen who
have proved outstanding in scholar-
ship and activities. Kenneth Fegley
E45, c h a i r m a n of all-student
awards committee for the Court,
has set up a point scale being based
to a greater degree on scholarship.
“We will award keys to about
10 per cent of the class,” ex-
plained Art T h o m p s o n , £43,
president of Men’s Council. “And
for the Honor Court personnel,
we plan to invite prominent stu-
dents to act as associate judges,
in addition to Council members.”
At this week’s Council meeting,
Ralph Hammond, BA43, was voted
to membership as representative of
the School of Business Administra-
tion. Hammond, an Independent.
replaces David Williams, a frater-
nity man, who defeated Hammond
in the spring election, but who has
since dropped out of school.

Arthur M. Guttery willlead an
informal open discussion at the

he Ati ol Tax Bill:

Every University student, every American,

T white, colored, Jew, Gentile, worker, employer, is

being endangered by the present ﬁlibuster being

yvaged against the anti-Poll Tax bill in the Senate. "

Brieﬂy, the bill seeks to let everybody vote—
regardless of whether or not he can pay a poll tax
-——which, in some southern states, is as high as
two dollars. And not only do you have to pa-y the
two dollars for the present year to Vote—but you
have to pay two dollars for every year that you
haven’t voted since your twenty-ﬁrst birthday.

Hardest hit, of course, by the pol1—tax restric-
tion on Voting are the southern Negroes. In fact,
the main reason for keeping this tax, which is
merely a hang—over from the idea that only prop-
erty holders, and not all people may vote--is to
keep the Negro from having his rightful share in
the operation of his government. ‘

' But the passage of the poll-tax bill is more than
the concern of the southern Negroes. Or the south-

ern whites. Or of any single group. It is the con-
cern of every single American who wants to win
the war. Because: ~

1. The effective ﬁghting of this war demands
the full support of every minority group within
our country—Negroes, Jews, Catholics, national
groups, to mention a few.

2. Global allied warfare demands the whole-
hearted cooperation of every race on this earth
toward the complete rout of Fascism. The Bur-
mese, the Indians, the natives of Africa ,the Chin-
ese, the millions upon millions of allied non-white
ﬁghters must be shown that this is not a white
man’s war to save a white man’s world. Axis prop-
aganda to the colored peoples of the world uses
the American restrictions of Negro ‘rights as its
strongest appeal. ‘

There are more non-white soldiers ﬁghting in
the cause of the Allied nations than there are
Whites. Don’t forget that. And it’s up to us to show

superiority myth. ' 
We must demonstrate that we believe in raci
and ethnic democracy, most important because _
is right, and secondly because if we don’t secu ~
the enthusiastic support of our cause from the non

Highlights '42 Pitt Season

Most of the Pitt football players
will be glad when the ﬁnal whistle
sounds tomorrow afternoon down at
State College ending a long weary
season. There is one player, how-
ever, who, because of his love for

._ the game, will genuinely be sorry
to hearthat whistle. He is Bill Dut-
ton, ~Pitt’s all-American halfback.

, Dutton, without whom the Pan--
_ thers would’ve been even more dis-'

~ appointing than they were, has
'-‘been playing football since his
' grade school days. And he’s-been
‘ good since then too. In 1938 he
was named all-West Virginia half-
; back as he completed his senior
“" year at'Weston high school. . . . . .
S The Weston Wildman was a little
unfortunate to be with Pitt during
a period of complete deemphasis in
football. His efforts on the gridiron
haven’t been deemphasized, how-
ever, as he blossomed into a ﬁrst
rate back here.

While this season has brought
personal glory to Dutton, it has
been his biggest disappointment

l. since he started playing. The high

spot in his grid career thus far,
came last season when Pitt turned

Corbetts Beat
Pitt Basketeers
in Exhibition Tilt

A fair indication of what Pitt
basketball is going to be like this
year under Dr. Carlson’s new
“blitzgrieg instead of sitzkrieg”
type of basketball may be gathered
-from the 56-54 contest the Panthers
lost to the Corbetts of the Muny
League in an exhibition game’ the
other night.

Although they lost the Doctor
seems fairly pleased with his team.
“We got out ﬁfty points,” he an-
nounced, apparently satisﬁed. At
present the Doctor is trying to
schedule some opening games at
home. Negotiations are going on
for games with Grove City and
Bethany to be played here in the
Stadium.

Another thing the basketball
mentor is working on is the possi-
bility of playing some afternoon
games. This is his solution to
t-he transportation problem. “If the
students go straight from school
to the games, the extra transporta-
tion will be cut out, and the teams
playing will be able to take earlier
trains home,” declared the Doctor.

on a powerful Fordham Ram and
won 13-0.

In commenting on the future,
Dutton declared, “I’d give my
right arm to play in the East-
West game at the end of this
season.” If chosen to play. that
would be his last game for the
duration as he is a member of the

Naval Reserve and expects to be .
in service after his graduation in -

June.

Billy Hillenbrand of Indiana and
Paul Sarringhaus,
great backﬁeld‘ star, are the best
players he's faced this year, while
Ohio ‘State was the toughest team
he played against. “They were the
best. coached team we played and
the most powerful,” the ‘Panther ace

The Lions have shown surprising power as they have
come back after an upset by Bill Kern’s West Virginians.
Since that surprise defeat. they have faced Syracuse and Penn
and have won from both. In their game with Penn last week
the Lions hit their peak as they-thoroughly outplayed the
favored Penn outﬁt and emerged the victors 13-7.

While Pitt, on the basis of comparative records should
be the decided underdogs, they may be able to come through
again as they did against Great Lakes. Pitt has the power.
Make no mistake about that. With Bill Dutton leading the
way, the Junglecats are capable of making things miserable
for their opponents if they will only

cou1d’ve made better showings had
they only put out a little more eﬂ’ort.
This was particularly true in the
Minnesota and Ohio State games.

Aside from Cornell, Syracuse,
Penn and Pitt the Lions schedule
has been minor leaguish. Teams
like Bucknell, Lehigh, et. al. are
breathers. With a schedule like the
one the Panthers had this season,
the Higginsmen would also be glad
the season is over after tomorrow.

The game tomorrow is no setup,
however, ‘ as players like Ken
Schoonover, Earl Brown, Bill Van
Lenten, Bob -Davis and Jack Ban-
bury give the State team a nucleus
for a strong outﬁt. Any team that

can come back as did the Lions‘

against Syracuse and Penn after

But, the Panthers have more than

they're going to make up a little

the chances are excellent that Bill
will become the leading ground

a total of 1260 yards gained and
is surpassed only by Frankie

Walt West has been calling the, ,

last two years, but a bad knee this

. year kept him out of the ‘starting! ‘

lineup in some of the games. He is
also a two-year letterman. — ‘

forms in the right half slot, played

bang up ball in the Great Lakes ‘ I A 

game and has not been the same
since. Stetler was injured in the
gameand has seen only limited
action since that time. Hailing from
Shaler Township, Stetler is the
other two-year letterman on the
squad.
Fullback Frank Saksa has been
a good workman-like player but he
never attracted much publicity or
attention. However Saksa has the
honor of having scored the second
touchdown against Fordham in
that upset of upsets last year.
Only man on the squad to start
in every game is Vince Antonelli
who plays at left guard. George
Allshouse has been regular center
for the past two years, but a bad
knee and the fact that he had to
play too much ball, and could not
stand up under the strain combined
to keep him out of action much of
the time this season.
