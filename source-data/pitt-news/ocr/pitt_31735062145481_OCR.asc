Three-Hour Session Needed For
Explanation, Final Approval
Of New Constitution

i

In a three-hour session Wednesday
evening, Student council approved in'
toto the constitution for the new,
Student-Faculty association of the:
University.

Point by Doint the new charter was:
discussed, with favorable action fol-l
lowing detailed explanation of thel
moot issues. Walter J, Rome, assist.-
ant dean of men, and member of the]
committee which drafted the coiistitu-l
lion. presented the committee’s view-l
point. Reviewing the history of allj
previous efforts toward reform in stu-‘
dent government, Mr. Rome showed:
that past efforts for change have al-f
ways been cinasculated from the ﬁrst,
by their division into factions. l

“The objectives of our committee":
he said, “have been two, The ﬁrsti
aim was to have all opinions repre-j
s.ented_ Mr. I\IcParland was wise"
enough to include all shades of.
thought in the group. The result has’
been that we have worked from the
ﬁrst toward a. cooperative unity among
students and faculty. Our second
goal was to eliminate any semblance
of group control from the new organ-i
ization. I believe that we have suc-
ceeded iii this, also."

Since January, it was explained,
the new constitution-drafting commit-
tee has been at work. After handing
over powers to a sub-committee. it
received the subgroup report, sent
the suggestions back for further re-;
vision, and only upon reexamination?
and further discussion approved the‘
constitution which was sent to C0llll-;
cil Wednesday. ,

Dr. ‘Vincent VV. Lanfear, dean of,
men, calls the new association “a”
splendid beginning.” He said after
the meeting, ‘‘I don’t think that I-
have ever" seen such serious effort
for the good of the entire student
body}!

Miss Thyrsa VV, Amos, dean of wo-
men, said yesterday, “The new plan,
represents the most progressive step‘
in college and university government
ever proposed at the University.

ties, Asked to explain the statistics,
he continues: “This year we're using,
more performers than ever before,j

Medical School Applicants ,
File For Entrance April 9%

 

Applications for entrance to the
School of Medicine will be available,
April 9, in Room 205, State hall. Of
the many pre-medical students ﬁling
applications, only sixty-ﬁve will be
admitted to the school. ,

Although satisfactory grades are al
major requisite for admission, marksl
do not mean everytiilng. Authorities
of the school say that individual char-
acter, health, neatness, home environ-
ment and appearance are inﬂuential
factors toward admittance. They also
advise having one science teacher
write a letter of recommendation to}
the school in the student’s behalf.’
Room has been left on the application
for the signature of two doctors, who,
by- their signature recommend the‘

nounced today. 

The University has recognized that 
many summer students will desire toi

to problems of current interest. The,
professional courses in education that ;
will be offered afford opportunity for]
the consideration of the probleinsl
which confront public school teachers
and executives. Classroom lectures
and discussions, seminars, group con-A
ferences, and opportunities for indi-l

planned with this in mind, l

In the academic ﬁelds, particularly,
in the social sciences, matters of cur-;

Dissolution Of Phil‘s Band
Causes Hurried Change .
ln Soldiers’ Plans

 

By Hy Cohen
It was almost another “Black Friday”
on the University campus as far as
the socially-minded student body was

concerned, when the Miltary Ball com-.

mittee received word late yesterday
evening that Phil Spitalnys band
would be unable to appear for the
dance tonight.

The natty uniforms and spotless
formais that had lain in storage since
the ill-fated Military Ball of last year,
were almost relegated to another hi-
bernation. But quick work by the
military science department, the
dance committee, and the Orchestra
Corporation of America rushed an-
other “name” orchestra to take the

place of the indisposed Phil Spitalny .

organization.
Vvord was received at the military
science department yesterday that

Phil SDitalny’s ba.nd had been dis-

_ solved last week, and that the play-

ers had been absorbed by other or
chestras in and about New York.
Rather than have Spitalny play at
the Military Ball with a makeshift
and pick-up organization, both the
Orchestra Corporation of America
_and Spitalny strongly urged that the
ROTC accept the services of the or-
chestra of Spitaliiy’s brothel‘.
Maurice Spitalny, an NBC artist
well known on the national air lanes,
comes to the Militaiy Ball after a
recent engagement at Radio City in
New York. Previous to that, he had
fulﬁlled a long engagement at the
Chicago theater in Chicago.

The other bands scheduled, Aaron-
5011's, P~ys1ianek’s, and Logan’s, will
be on hand on the seventeenth ﬂoor
of the William Penn hotel tonight
for the dance. Both Aaronson and
Maurice Spitalny will broadcast from
,the ball rooms over station KDKA,
ifrom 12 until 12:30 o’clock..

A new note in decorations of to-
niglit’s dance will be the naming of
the various rooms and corners, The
Urban room will be carded as the
ROTC room and the ball room as the
Army room. The corners will be
identiﬁed by letters. To keep the
dance moving the orchestras have
been synchronized so each will play
for ﬁfteen minutes. Each dance will
begin and end at exactly the same
time.

Among the notables on the guest
list are Frederick M. Clapp, president
of the board of trustees; governor
Gifford Pinchot; General Malone;
Mayor McI\'air; and Dr. John G. Bow-
man,

The sale of tickets will close to-
night at 6 o’clock and none will be

sold at the door. The cost is $3 per

YMCA Election
To Bare Relative
Factional Power

Reign Of Bracken, Wadsworth
Groups To Be Determined
Next Monday Afternoon

 

By Bernard Fleming
Next Monday afternoon's election
at 4:15 o’clock in the YMCA hut of
student members of the YMCA com-

year, beginning May 1, will be an in-
dication of the relative powers of the
two factions that are striving for
dominance in this organization. The
members of the committee of man-
agement have been kept from a com-
plete break by the tactful handling of
their executive secretary, W. W. Men-
denhall. At present the factioiial
groups are quite friendly, personally,
but all follow Mahatma Gandhi’s
passive resistance when it comes to
supporting each other’s net projects.

While no one person is quite sure
who's who or what’s what at the
YMCA hut, one division seems to be
led by John P, Bracken, C34, and the
other by Homer Wadsworth, C35.
The main point of dissension (accord-

operation. The other point is that
many of the members of the cabinet
have been doing little or nothing.

Regardless of the bickerings of the
student members, the nominating
committee under the chairmanship of
Dr. C. G. King, of the chemistry de-
partment, nominated the following:
James Ballantyne, C36, Frank Black,
E35, Edward Brethauer, C35, King
Derr, C35, Seymour Evans, BA36, Nile

Kurtz, C35, Winston McConkey, C35,
William Murchison, BA36, Kenneth
Mccracken, C35, and Homer \Vads-
worth, E35, Additional nominations
may be presented by petitions. Each
petition must be signed by 25 mem-
bers who have not signed a like peti-
tion for any one else and must be
filed ﬁve days before the election.

The method of election followed by
the YMCA is by a representative
electoral body composed of the chair-
men of all YMCA committees and
members of the committee of nian-
agement. Electors may be added to
the electoral body by petitions, A
petition on behalf of any members
must be signed by 25 members who
have not signed a like petition. Peti-
tions must be ﬁled five days prior to
election.

The elected students to the com-
mittee of management will be in-
stalled on \Vednesday evening, April
25, at the Silver Anniversary of the
campus association.

Those eligible for voting for
committee of management members

are: Dr. S. B. Linliart, secretary of

,i_ Letters To The Editor I

March 18, 1934.

 

Editor, The Pitt News:

Let me congratulate you for the excellent front-page
editorial titled “Don't Worry, Mother,” in last Friday's
News.

The actual facts it presents——-the unthinking conform-
ity of college students, and their apathy to matters of
direct concern to t.heni—are plain to anyone who will use
his eyes. My admiration isn't over the fact that you raw
these things; it's because you expressed thein without

Their duties :.hall be ,;

soft soap. and with humor, and fire, and nia.turity—and,
most of all, because you actually published it.

It's easy enough to recognize the folly of war rnd of
rule by private enterprise, and the stupidity of the
ni-asses~—and let it go at that, Experiences have shown
that people can be aroused, basic reform can be initiated,
by persistent agitation. To speak the facts plainly, to
help organize against war and its causes——these are the
difficult things. for they require the courage to risk the
disastrous “disfavor” of the jeaious gods of the status
quo, the courage to risk losing what petty advantages we
have won.

I don’t have that courage, myself. I have rio intention
of becoming a martyr for the sake of :1 bunch of numb-
skulls who “don‘t want to be savccl.” Mr. Editor, your
task of creating :1 real interest in the war question : mong
stur.leiit.s must come ﬁrst; and I sincerely urge you to
keep at it. Until you succeed, I shall have to identify
myself as a well-meaning but

APATHETIC STUDENT.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Allow me to express my personal thanks for the gen-
erous allotment of space for pub'icity in connection with
the Fifth Annual History Conference. I assure you that
you rendered not only the Pitt News and those of us
who were in charge of the conference a service, but the
University as well.

Respectfully,

' [Polish Foundation Gives
Louden Explalns l Scholarship To Warsaw

Spearman Theory

i
Psychology Forum Hears Talk On 

' I
Intelhgence Factors , {summer course.

The Kosciuszko foundation is again
.offering its annual scliolai‘sl1ip to the
lUniversity of VVarsaw, Poland, for a

Education School
Gets Applications

 

, All Students Seeking Admission
Must Pass Set Standards

Any University

 

The theory of two factors in intel-
ligeiice. which has been advocated by
Speariiian, was explained by Miss
Mary V. Loudeii, instructor in psychol-

ogy, at the Psychology forum meeting I

last Monday at 4:30.

“Spearman's doctrine," Miss Louden
said, “implies the existence of a gen-
eral ability varying in power from
one individual to the other but re-
maining constant in the one individual
and in addition a vast number of
more or less speciﬁc abilities.”

Miss Louden explained that Spear-
1nan's doctrine holds that the ability
to do something is made up of two
factors; one general, one speciﬁc. For
convenience in explanation, he has
designated the general factor “G.”

“Spearman says," the speaker con-
tinued, “that the main point of his
doitriiie of two factors is not what
is the nature of ‘G.’ but that there
are two factors.”

Another factor is that perhaps there
is sonietliiiig quantitative rather than
qualitative in the individual.

1ti;l'.l leans most detliiitely now.

Miss Louden went on to prove these
points by equations involving
‘luv-tm‘s and told of the sources from
whic=.i Spea.riiiaii had derived
‘tll‘.‘(il‘y, His doctrine has been ex-
p.n:m.le:‘i as a result of experiineni'.a-
tion. actual observation, and, finally,
iiii+'rp:'ctatioi1,

Dr. George Ellis Jones, chairman
of the Psycliology foruni, aiiiioiinced
tl::ir, Dr. Floreiice M. 'l‘eagarden, pro-
fe:-ssor of psychology, will address the
forum at its meeting Monday.

Phi Sigma
Phi Sigma, honorary biological
society, will hear Dr. John C.

Donaldson, professor of anatomy,
discuss “Changing Viewpoints in
Endocrinology” at a meeting
wliicli will take place this eve-
ning at the University cafeteria,

That is,
tlie. explanation toward which Spear-,
I

these .

his "

lseiiior or graduate student of Polish
?,exti-action who is interested in the
lscliol-a,i'sliip should communicate with
iDr. Tliaddeiis A. Starzynski, advisor
; of the Joseph Conrad club, immediate-
ly.

, The foundation was first organized
iin 1924 with an executive board com-
lposed of prominent men from Poland
[as well as from the United States. It
‘took upon itself the task of sending

i

lPolisli-Americaii students to Poland‘,

:where they could learn about the
country, the institutions, and the peo-
ple_

the six students in the United States
to receive the scholarship last year.

The present officers of the Kosci-
iiszko foundation are: Henry Noble
MacCracl<en, president of Vassar col-
lege,‘ president; Paul Monroe, vice
president; Willis ll, Booth, executive
ot' the Giiaraiity Triist company, New
York, treasurer; Stephen P. Mizwa,

tee.

Parlcz Vous?

Bridge? Yes, But Bridge
In French Isn't Quite
What You’d Think

“ ’S too bad you weren’t there.”
“We had an ’ooh, la, la, time.”
“\Vhat luck, and such grand
musici" Thus run the various
comments on the highly success-
ful ten-table card party which the
Alliance Francaise gave in the
Cathedral studio, 1309 Cathedral,
last Saturday afternoon, March 17.

Nearly everybody present knew
some l.<‘i’ench, but for the beneﬁt
of the few non-linguists, Mr. and
Mrs. Louis Celestin, co-chairmen
of the affair, erected and placed
1 the plaque bearing the following‘
i interpretations in the center of
§ the studio: Your deal (votre
1 donne); cut (coupez); did you
sliufﬂe (Avez-vous battii les
cartesi’); your lead (votre tour);
inisdeal (il y a nialdonne); club V
(treﬂe) ; diamond (carreau) ;
heart (coeur); spade (pique);
no trump (sans atout); ace (1’as);
king (le i-oi’); queen (la reine);
jack (le valet).

But the surprise of the after-
noon was the presence ‘of W'a1ter
Geiseking, famous pianist, in the
city for his Sunday concert, who
' posed for a picture while seated
l at the Nevin piano, and then, im-
'; promptu, played several Nevin
1 selections while “les cartes” shuf-

l
l
l

ﬂed on. This time the answer
isn’t, “Were you dere, Charlie,”
but “Parlez vous Francais?”

Relay Men Seek §Cats Start Trip 

Butler Relays At Indiana

Moviiig westward for the third suc-
cessive week-end, Coach Olson and
his Panther trackmen left this morn-
ing for Indianapolis, Indiana, where
the trackers will compete in the But-
ler relays tonight and tomorrow.

Leading the procession for Pitt in
the meet will be the crack mile relay
quartet whose record to date reads
“two mid-west track meets entered
and two new records set up.” The
Panthers turned in a time of three
minutes, 22.9 seconds at the Armour
Tech relays last Sa.turday and are
out to lower that ﬁne mark on the
Butler university indoor track.

Further trials during the week
found Kiger, Groat, Connelly and
Keller weathering some stiff competi-
tion to make up the team which will
do the running in the event, which
is coming to be known as “Olson’s
specialty.’' The boys will run in the
order named.

Arvel Fleming, who last week won
the 70-yard low hurdles event and
placed third in the 70-yard dash at
Armour Tech, will be entered in
those events at Indianapolis. Emil
Bonavita will enter his favorite event,
the shot~put, in which he took sec-
ond at the Chicago affair.

Riﬂemen Shoot
For Team Title

Six members of the Varsity riﬂe
team and coaches Lieutenant A. E.
\Yilson and Sergeant A. A. Gunter
left by automobile early yesterday
morning for Cincinnati, Ohio, scene of
the National Intercollegiate Riﬂe as-
sociation championships.

The members of the team who are
making the trip are those who have
consistently recorded high scores
since the beginning of the season.
Those making the trip are Charles
Zoller. Jr., Robert Davis, Robert
Weitersliausen, William Frabotta, Jo-
seph Mastrucci and J. C, Duff.

Approximately ten teams from
schools embracing Pennsylvania, Vvest
Virginia and Ohio will ﬁre for the
sectional championship today and to-
morrow. Throughout the country riﬂe
teams will be shooting under the Na-
tional Riﬂe association’s regulations
for the national championships.

It sure is a coincidence that the

“Oi1 to Atlanta” is the cry of the 
National Association of Basketball
Coaches and “On to Atlanta” echoes
the cry of Dr. Carlson and his Pitt
basketeers as ﬁnal preparations are
made for the big trek south.

At 6 o’clock Tuesday morning the
Panther party will set out on the
Lincoln highway to cover the ﬁrst
lap of their journey. At present plans
call for two autos to make the trip.
Dr, George F. Kowallis, assistant var-
sity coach, will chauffeur the ﬁrst
car and will have with him as travel-
ing companions the quintet of Noon,
Cribbs, Oclisenhirt, McCamaiit and
\Vainio. Dr. Carlson himself will coin-
mandeer the second car and will
transport the two Hughes boys and
Roderick, in addition to his family.
There is a possibility that Frank Car-
ver, director of athletic publicity, will
drive a third auto and take along
more members of the basketball
squad.

The ﬁrst night’s stop will be at
Raleigh, North Carolina. Another jaunt
of 215 miles on Wednesday will ﬁnd
the gang at Columbia, South Car-
olina, where an exhibition game win
he Played with South Carolina U.
Tliursday’s trip will bring the boys
into Atlanta in time to demonstrate
their wares at a coaches’ meeting in
the evening. In all probability the
Panthers will meet the DeKalb’ Teach-
ers’ College, winners of the Little
Nineteen conference championship, in
a 20-minute exhibition.

Friday will be a “vacation day”
with another basketball demonstra-
tion in the evening. Saturday is down
on the schedule as a “free day.”
\Vhile the folks up home are pluck-
ing various kinds of eggs from well-
ﬁlled Easter baskets, the Panthers will
begin the trip home, The journey will

be made through Tennessee, Kentucky,
Ohio and back to Pennsylvania. Every— ,
one is hoping that the Keystone state]
will be reached by Monday, April 2,!
so that the boys will be able to at-2
tend classes on the ﬁrst day of school §
following the Easter recess. ]
