Emil Herman Wins SC Prexy

Jane PicIceringiElected Veep

By TIM KOVAR 6

A tense drama reached a cli-H
max Wednesday afternoon
when Emil Herman was elect-
ed ‘president of Student Con-

Jane Pickering, this year’s
corresponding secretary received
a unanimous vote for the position
_of vice-president on Herman’s
cabinet. Pat Woods, senior repre-
sentative defeated P a u 1 i n e
Markess for the secretary’s posi-
tion. - .

IF delegate to Congress Mark
Friedman edged out freshman
Arabia for treasurer and Pauline
Markess, sophomore representa-
tive won out over Bea Pellagrino
for the position of corresponding
secretary.

Pre-election politicking brought
out three candidates for the
prexy’s job. Herman, Joe Tratt-
ner and ' Paul Petro ran on the
first ballot after minutes of dis-
cussion on each man.

Herman and Trattner had the
edge in votes with Petro elimin-
ated for the second ballot. Petro
thanked his supporters and threw
his vote to Herman and asked

now vote for “the man who would
make the best SC president-Emil

Herman a clear majority.

The results of the presidential
election ended the tenseness and
the rest of the officers were ‘elect-
ed on straight ballots.

Herman received an ovation that
was surpassed only by the ap-
plause for "out-going prexy Ross
Reese as he handed over the gavel
after the elections. '

“One Whirl”, the informal Main

Ball climaxing Spring Festival

Week, will be held at Syria
Mosque on Saturday, May 8, from
8:30 p.m. to midnight. Due .to the
cancellation of the‘ Spring Com-
mons Room Ball, the festival ball
will be the last school event of
the year.

All trophies for the shows,
ﬂoats, booths, fronts, Sweepstakes
and Coed Olympics will be award-
ed at 8:30 p.m. The Spring Fes-
tival Queen, “Miss Internationale”,
and her court will be crowned at
intermission. ' ‘

Jerry Gray and his “Band of
Today” will be the featured band
for the dance with Linda Lee as
vocalist. Gray supplied the power
behind two great bands from 1936
until 1944. He was ﬁrst. an ar-
ranger with Artie Shaw’_s band,

This year Herman served as a
member" of- the public relations
committee of SC and led the drive
to change the‘ words of ,th pep
song “Hail to Pitt.” He is’ also

Society, vice-president of

In 1940, he joined the Glenn
M i l l e r organization, arranging

eluding “String of Pearls” and

Many of Gray’s best band mem-
bers were formerly with the Shaw
and Miller bands and are now
carrying on the style and tradition
of the Glenn Miller Orchestra.

cause the committee wanted to
keep everything within the Oak-
land district, will be decorated in
an international style, depicting
scenes from the “Tivoli” shows.

Expressing optimism over the coming meet, Duff indi-

cates that he will be running the boys in the same events

that they will enter the following week at Penn,State. “The

boyswill be going all-out to turn in their best times of the

season,” he promises.

According to the youthful tu-
tor, Schenley’s Arnie Sowell has
a very good chance to break the
University record in the 440—yard
run. In addition, several’ other
records could well be topped.

Repeat Indicated

In last year’s meet with the
-Mounties, Pitt took eleven ﬁrsts as
they racked up the West‘ Vir-
ginians to the tune of 100-31. The
Panthers ﬁgure to do at least as
well on Saturday. In fact, it ap-
pears that West Virginia’s best
strength lies in the shotput and
plenty of competition from the
Blue—and-Gold.

Scordo.‘ Spangler was awarded
the Special Academic Achieve-
ment ‘ Award last Wednesday,

Adding to the “new look” at

Festival Funds
Aid Students

Spring Festival Executive Com-
mittee has decided to set up ‘an
International Loan Fund with half
the net proﬁts of Festival. This is
in keeping with the Festival theme,
“International Capers.” ,

The fund would aid foreign ex-
change students at Pitt and Pitt
students studying abroad. Foreign
students are often hard-pressed by
ﬁnancial difficulties because of fed-
eral laws limiting the amount of
money they may earn at part-time
jobs. The fund, which will be
chaired by Vice—Chancellor Charles
B. Nutting, will be administered by
the International Exchange Com-
mittee. .

In addition, the festival com-
mittee has decided to make the

tional awards at Tap Day as guests
of the committee. The awardees
to be honored are the winners of
the “S Award,” the Nationality
Room awards, and the Norwegian
Room Committee award.
