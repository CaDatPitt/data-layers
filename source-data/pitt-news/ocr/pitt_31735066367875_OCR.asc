Student Aid Cut

Students. legislators and
zulininistratois lashed"‘out at
President Reagan and banded
together‘ in an effort to tomhat
potentially lieaxjv losses of stu-
dent aid.

The first rumblings of protest
came in l“el)ru;n‘§ when the Pro-
gressive Student Network

-_.-(PS;\") organi/ed on campus as

pa‘rt"'oli a natiowitle effort to
alert Reagan to student dissatis-
faction with his proposed
cutl')a('ks.

The PSN attempted to col-
lege l0,000 signatures to sent to
Thornburgh, Reagan and the

legislature.
cIn March, the Student

Government Board's Govern-
mental. Relations Committee
sponsored a speakers’ forum on
the student aid cuts.

“Stand up and be counted

and help yourself to an educa-
tion,” state Rep. Frank Pistell
said at the forum. "Don't let the
opportunity slip by because
some drone in Washington or
Harrisburg feels you don't
deserve it."

U.S. Rep. Doug Walgren
warned that the aid cuts will hit

the broad middle-income
bracket of society.

“The public believes that
we’re cutting the budget for tax
breaks," Walgren said. “Tl1at's
the farthest thing from the
truth. The cuts are made to pro-
vide for massive expenditures in

I the military. 2

Student aid programs sched-
uled to be cut under the Reagan
program include:

0 The Pell Grant Program.
which would be cut from its
current $2.8 billion to $1.4 bil-
lion. This would eliminate one

million students from the pro-

gram and cut maximum grants
for those remaining.

0 The Supplemental Educa-
tion Opportunity Grants,
National Direct Student Loans
and State Student Incentive
Grants, in total.

o The College Work,Study

if Program, which would be

reduced from $528 million to
$400 million, forcing the elimi-
nation of 27 percent of the sub-
sidized jobs.

Academic
Reforms
Approved

In tune with a nationwide
back-to—basics trend in educa-
tion, Pitt faculty voted last year
to adopt a more conservative
undergraduate curriculum.

Students entering Pitt in 1983
or 1984 will be be required to
demonstrate a three—year level
of high school language profi-
ciency or take ‘two terms of col-
lege level study, successfully
complete at least one math
course and fulfill specifir writ-
ing requirements in courses
otttsitle the English department
and take 36 credits in certain
courses in the humanities and
the natural and social sciences.
Previously, students only had to
take nine courses from nine dif-
ferent departments to fulfill
their distribution of studies
requirement. Two years of high
school languagestudy had been
recommended and students
could graduate without ever
having taken a language, litera-
ture or philosophy course.

It took the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences several weeks of debate
before the proposals, which
were recommended by a faculty
committee headed by CAS Dean
Schulman, were approved.

Much of the faculty debate
centered on the natural science
requirement while students
argued unsuccessfully for man-
datory teaching evaluations.

The proposals will be imple-
mented by several faculty and
student committees. 0

Of 1982: Tuition

Ailing Med School
TriesTo Salvage

Pitt’s School of Medicine was
sick last year with something
that neither its brightest
students— not faculty members
.could cure—a decline in its rep—.
putation as one of the nation’s
major centers for n1_edical
research and education.

The debate over the school's
decline started last summer
when the Liason Committee on
Medical Education gave the
medical school a three-year
accreditation.

In its follow-up report, the
committee listed seven areas of
concern, including an inability
by the school to recruit chair-
men for the basic science
departments, a shortage of aca-
demic space, questionable fiscal
stability, poor communications
with students and a need for
improvement in the desicions
made within the academic
chain of command.

Shortly after the report was
released, it was announced that
tuition for med school students
would be substantially
increased. Tuition was hiked 17
percent for upperclassmen and
32 percent for freshmen and
increased to $14,400 a year for
out-of-state freshmen and

Its Reputation

$12,600 for out-of-state
upperclassmen. _

In November, a confidential
report written by the school’s
dean Donald Leon and sent to
Gov. Dick Thornburgh, was
leaked to the media. The report
revealed that the school was fac-
ing a more than $2.8 million
deficit for the 1981-82 fiscal year
and that Pitt had had to divert
more than $12.9 million from
its general operating budget
since 1975 to cover debts.

Leon wrote the governor that
“If the problems of academic
space, budget and tuition sup-
port are not solved promptly,
the school’s accreditation status
will be at risk and a major com-
monwealth resource will be
jeapordized. "

Leon also wrote that tuition
levels for Pitt’s medical students
are “extraordinarily high,”
adding that the mean four—year
debt for a Pennsylvania student
is $45,000, but with accumu-
lated interest, the debt reaches
$75,000.

Despite the turbulent year.
things are looking better for the
school. The state increased
funding it by 6 percent, and
Leon released an optimistic
mid-year report to the educa-
tion’ committee.

 

, The annual Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival was

‘ held June 17-Aug. 15 at Stephen Foster Memorial
Hall. The three plays this summer were.“Hamlet,”
“The Merry wives of Windsor,” and “The 'lZempest.”

Tuition Hiked Again

Tuition for Pitt students was
raised $240 for this school year,
a 12.2 percent hike. in. May by
the Board of Trustees.

That raises tuition costs for
the next school year from $1,970
to $2,210. It also marks the l2th
time during the last I3 years
that Pitt has hiked its tuition.

- Pitt has a $3l9.3 million
operating budget for fiscal year
I983. an increase of 7.8 percent
over that of previous years.

Also raised were the student
health fee-—from $21 to $30 per
term—and the student activity
fee——from $12 to $14 per term.

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var said state support for Pitt,
was increased 4.7 percent, was
considerably lower than the rate
of inflation and the amount
requested by’ the university,
“resulting in the necessity to
raise tuition again forthe com-
ing year.”

Pitt Finishes Low
ln College Ratings

The Pitt Panthers may do
well in the national rankings
each year, but the university as a
whole doesn't fare as well,
according to a New York Times
survey . of‘ 175 colleges and
universities.

“The New York Times Selec-
tive Guide to College" rated the
institutions on a scale of one to
five stars, five being the best.

Pitt earned three stars for aca-
demics and two each for quality
of life tllltl social life:

The ratings were based on the
results of questionnaires sent to
selected students and adminis-
strators of the schools, in addi-
tion to some Times writers.

College of Arts and Sciences
DEB“ Irwin Schulman called the
survey “simple minded.”

“I don’t think it was an accu-
rate assessment," Schulrnan
said. “It's too simple minded to
try and rate a school over all on
a few characteristics, especially
a school like Pitt, where there is
such a diverse student body.”

Carnegie-Mellon fared the
‘best of the area colleges in the
survey, with a four in academics
and a three in both social life
and quality of life. Duquesne
scored only two stars in each
area and was among the 10
lowest-rated schools in the
guide.

hoc Committee recommenda-
tion to the contrary.

FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg
said at an April meeting with
geography faculty and students

A that he will prepare a document

calling for the termination of
the department.

Rosenberg said the depart-
ment has suffered declines in
enrollment, has not made a
national impact in the rankings
of its discipline and is
“recognizably weak” because it
lacks a reputable research
phase.

Rosenberg said that Pitt will
save $140,000 by closing the
department. He said an auton-
omous geography department
is not needed because other
existing departments are doing
the work in which geography is
interested.

But history professor Edward
Muller, who was recommended
to chair the department in Sep-
tember, said the university is the
“major loser“ if the department
is eliminated.

I-le charged that the dean's
enrollment projections were
inar curate and that there is an
"overemphasis’ by the admin-
istration toward examining
strictly financial criteria with-

Political

The AMERICANS FOR DEMOCRATIC ACTION is a non-party
affiliated‘ group which informs students about liberal alternative
policies. The ARMS RACE STUDY GROUP educates students
about the realities of the current arms race and hopes to show its
danger. The COLLEGE YOUNG DEMOCRATS expound Demo-
cratic philosophy through education, guest speakers and a newslet— L
ter. The PITT COLLEGE REPUBLICANS are interested in_voter
registration and providing an opportunity for the university to
meet and discuss current political issues. The CONSTITU-
TIONAL SYNDICALIST PARTY, a new organization, wants to

promote understanding and support for constitutional syndicalism
_among Pitt students. The FRIENDS OF THE SPARTACUS
YOUTH LEAGUE prepares shows and forums to further the
understanding of the goals of the labor and socialist movements.
The PROGRESSIVE STUDENT NETWORK educates students
about the draft, cutbacks in student aid and the rise of fascist

groups.

Pitt-Oakland YMCA:

Making Connections

The Pitt-Oakland YMCA pro-
vides many students with an
opportunity to be a part of a com-
munity, and according to executive
director Julie Hill, it is the main
connection between the university
and the Oakland community.

This connection is made
through various programs spon-
sored by the Y. The programs are
totally operated by the students,
including fund—raising and the
reviewing of prospective
volunteers.

The Corrections Program
entails matching student volun-

teers with youths in the Shuman

Detention ‘Center or the McIntyre
County Child Welfare Shelter. Stu-
dents may also choose to help
youths on probation readjust to
society or to assist them in a home
for delinquents. ’

Many of the programs require a
student to donate less than six
hours of his time to the community
each week. Students who are away
from home and find that they miss
their younger brothers or sisters
can go to the YMCA and be a big
brother or sister to a child who

needs them.
Other programs offered through

the YMCA are the lMed-X Pro-

grams, the Community Youth Pro-
grams and the Tutorial Programs.

These are all designed to provide-

students with ways to serve others
and at the same time find personal
satisfaction.

The YMCA programs also create
opportunities for students to work
in their potential career fields.

The YMCA is no longer just for
men; women may and do partici-
pate in the programs also.

Pam Tokar, a Pitt student volun-
teer, teaches an aerobics class‘ that is
sponsored by the Y. This is one way
in which money is raised by stu-
dents to subsidize other activities,
such as backpacking.

“Students are tremendous,” said
Hill. “I wish we could hook up
with more.” Hill is enthusiastic
about this coming year, in fact, she
would like to see the National Con-
vention for the YMCA held at Pitt
next year.

The Pitt-Oakland YMCA is
located on the seventh floor of the
Student Union. It had been on the
main floor and now Hill is con-
cerned that students will not be as
likely to just walk in and find out
just what the Y can offer them.

Service

ALPHA PHI OMEGA, a national service fraternity, raises funds for
charities and provides programs as a service to the university com-
munity. ANGEL FLIGHT is a non-profit organization that sup-

,ports the Air Force ROTC program and holds social activieis at

Veterans hospitals. A-PHI-Q-FOXX CLUB provides peer counsel-
ing and tutoring programs. ARNOLD AIR SOCIETY promotes
the Air Force through service projects. CIRCLE K gives the students
opportunity for leadership training in a service organization and
hold activities for the School for the Blind (Jhildren and other
organizations. GAMMA SIGMA SIGMA holds bake sales and runs
:1 muscular distropliy project. Its purpose is to assenible college
women to serve the university tonnnnnity.

Students taking courses offered
by the University Honors Program
(UHP) will find themselves facing
a challenge. The UHP stresses the
importance of academics by com-
bining challenging coursework,
individual effort, outstanding
teaching and an academic

‘community.

Susan Wahrenberger, assistant
director of the UHP, said that the
program is “for highly capable and
motivated students.” ‘

An example of just how moti-
vated UHP students can be is The
Pittsburgh Undergraduate
Review, developed by Pitt student,
Robert Pape. He started The
Review because he and others
believed that many important
undergraduate papers never got
further than a professor’s desk. The
Review is unique because it is the
only undergraduate journal in the
country that is refereed by faculty

members. Analytical papers are-

now being sent from all over the
country.

Last year, UHP student Debbie
Bruce began and headed an infor-

The Honors Program
Challenges Students

, mal reading group. Bruce, a junior
chemistry student, approached
Wahrenberger with the idea
because she and ether students

were interested in reading and‘”dis- ~

cussing literature but were unable
to fit additional courses into their
schedules. The reading group will
resume activity this fall under
Bruce; it is not limited to UHP
students.

In order to obtain permission for
UHP courses, an incoming fresh-
man should have SAT scores of
1200 and have graduated in the top
ten percent of his class. An upper-
classman should ,have a QPA of
3.25 or higher. Students not meet-
ing these criteria but demonstrat-
ing high interest are usually
granted special permission.

There are also UHP courses for
engineering students in the rigor-
ous Sophomore Honors in Engi-
neering (SHE) program. Entry into
SHE is by invitation only.

Although UHP courses demand
effort, Wahrenberger said most stu-
dents achieve a sense of personal
satisfaction that encourages them
to come back and take other UHP
classes.

To Get Involved

Problem: How does a fresh-
man make friends in an urban
school that has approximately
14,000 undergraduates?

iMany students solve that‘

problem by joining one of Pitt’s
21 recognized fraternities. Pitt's
“Greeks,” as they are called, are
governed by the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), which oversees

=the activities _of 1,000 young
men.

Each fraternity, in turn, has
an administrative staff to set
policies for the individual
fraternity.

chased for $5 and entitles the

time period. Closed rush runs

_from September 13-25 for invit-

ees only.

Pitt's fraternities hold blood
drives, hoagie sales and com-
pete in “Greek Week”. Greek
Week is held every spring, with
chariot races, singing contest,
dance marathons and other
activities to raise money for a
specific charity.

Lou McLinden, IFC adviser,
said he does not expect the
crunch on financial aid to have
any effect on the fraternity pop-
ulation at Pitt.

“It’s not too much more
expensive to belong to a. frater-
nity than it is to live in adormi-
tory,” he said.

   

There is also a weekly supple-
ment to The Pitt News called

Helping Ad
To College

By PEGGY FERRI

Your roommate hates you and
your mother calls you three times a
day to make sure you're “all right.”
Tower's cafeteria food makes you
sick, you have two exams next
Thursday, a paper due Friday, and
you can’t afford a Big Mac, let
alone books.

What would happen if you ever
became sick? Or if it all becomes
too much and you fail? Or if you
need somebody totalk to? What do
you do then? -

Advisers are accessible for 16
hours or more a week, but accord-

that they want more time.

“I know that some advisers sign
registrations because they think
that the student knows his mind or
because the student’s class will be
closed soon,” Koloc explained,
“but when an adviser does that the
student should tell me or the

Barry Applbaum, the coordinator
of honors advising for the Univer-
sity Honors Program.

“Most advisers spend most of
their time with students who have
difficulties; honors students need
help too," Applbaum explained,
“but often don’t receive the atten-
tion and advising they need.”

Applbaum has a background in
genetics and calls himself a strong
proponent of a liberal arts educa-

students to explore the academic

The University Placement Ser-
vice helps students find full or part-
time jobs. The Student
Employment Office in the Lower

Lounge of the Student Union-

assists students in obtaining part-
time jobs during the school year
and part or full-time jobs during
the summer.

The Office receives job positions
from both on and off-campus,
according to University Placement
Service director Robert Hopkins.

“You can watch the ads and
pound the pavements or you can
use t‘he_alternative. We've practi-
cally done most of the work for
you," Hopkins explained.
“Employers know from experience
that our office can fill their posi-
tions and we, thereby, have become
a contact." Y

According to Hopkins. the pro-
eess begins with an initial visit dur-
ing which the student registers
with the Student Employmnt

J

Office and then makes an appoint-

ment. All job openings are posted
on the bulletin board outside of the
office.

A “There is work to be done some-
where all year long and we give Pitt
students the opportunity to do
something for money,” Hopkins
said.

“The positions change on a day-
to-day basis and the student should
check the board just while walking
through. There is a definite benefit
to being first,” he added.

Hopkins says the office also has a
computer to search all registration
entrees if an employer is looking
for unique qualifications. “There-
fore,” he explained, “there is also a
benefit to being on the list.”

Student

Services

The Student Health Service in
Brackenridge Hall offers several
services and a kind of quasi-

Frank Carter.

The services are performed by
nurses and include:

Stop Smoking Clinic——A five-
week program counseling smokers
once a week.

Family Planning——Students are
told of available methods of contra-
ception on an individual basis. An
appointment is necessary and can
be made by calling 624-5942.

Stress Managernent-—A four-
session, educational program
designed to help students cope
with stress.

According to health educator
Bob I.aCivita, stress unchecked can
cause the individual to become
sick. It can be responsible fora lack
of'(7()nct‘ntrati‘0n, high blood pres-
sure and a lower" immunity to vir-
uses, as often experienced around
finals.

“We teach techniques,” LaCiv-

ita explained, “but it’s up to the

g student to keep up with them.”

The program consists of pro-
gressive muscle relaxation, auto-
genic training (a kind of
self-hyponosis using miniature
bio-feedback instruments) and

diaphragm breathing.

“Sometimes a freshman is just
homesick and wants someone to
talk to,” said Jean Koesel, assistant
to the director of the Counseling
and Student Development Center.
But whatever the problem, if that
person wants some impartial feed-
back he can come here."

Koesel added that it is always
best t.o come before the problem is
really severe. “You could save
yourself some grief," she said.

Athletic
Suppon,

For athletes, there is the Office of
Support Services for Student Ath-

ing academic success. ’

The Support Service offers aca-
demic advising, personal guidance

to inform the student of what he
needs to be successful.

Another tutorial service, free to
all students, is offered by Phi Eta
Sigma.

To help. students through the
difficulties experienced in writing
those first few papers, English
facultyand tutors provide informal
writing instruction. The Writing

Pitt’s Student Government

Board had a fairly easy time
during the 1981-82 school year.
Aside from President Reagan's
financial aid cuts, there were
not many major issues evident
on campus. December saw the
end of Bill Abraham’s two-year
reign as president and the
installation of his protege,
Todd DeLuca. Here is a short
round-up of some SGB head-
line stories:

0 Curriculum reform:

While the College of Arts and

Sciences and the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences councils were
attempting to decipher the
semantics of the proposed cur-
riculum reform, the SGB and its
council appointees tried their
best to represent the students’
interest.

Linda O’Connor and Chip

Roth, FAS and CAS council

The Pitt News, Sunday, August 29, 1982-News

111981-82 Easy Year for SGB

The board was dead set
against the foreign language
requirement and held that
stance to the very end. It did
however, .“generally endorse”
the social science requirement,
the physical science require-
ment and ,the humanities
requirement. This was after it
had decided not to endorse any-
thing in this curriculum reform
package and proposed their
own. The members of the board
soon withdrew the proposal
after CAS Dean Irwin Schul-
man told them it did not stand a
c_ha_nc_e.

0 Resignation:

Board member Mark Stevens
resigned on October 22, citing
“other interests” in his aca-

. demic and career goals for his

retirement.

The morning of his resigna-
tion, Stevens had a discussion
with ‘then-president Abraham
about his lack of attendance at
SGB public meetings. Stevens

forced to hold hearings and
remove him from office as the
constitution requires.

Stevens planned to attend the
Culinary Arts Institute in New
York and then train in France.

The board decided not to
replace Stevens since there was
only a short time left to this
boards’ administration.

0 Recognition: .

The SGB’s recognition pro-
cess was put to the test in late
October when two groups were
trying for partial recognition
from the board.

Two religious groups were
vying for recognition when it
was learned that both groups
fell under the same parent
organization and had much the
same goals and objectives in
common. The one obvious dif-
ference, however, was the racial
majority of the two groups: one
comprised mostly of black stu-
dents and the other mostly
white.

given recognition and the other
not.

After much heated debate and
a split in the board's voting,
recognition was finally given to
the black group because the
board members said they
believed that group best met the
needs of the students.

0 Election:

Mid-November was the elec-
tions for the new board and a
surprising number of candi-
dates showed interest. Four pre-
sidential candidates and 14
board hopefuls were in the run-
off.

Todd DeLuca’s fiercest com-
petitor was colleague Collen
Clarke. They ran neck-and-
neck through the first part of
the vote tabulation but DeLuca
pulled ahead at the end.

The board race had Robbie
The, Linda O’Connor and
Chip Roth as sure winners from
the very start. Who would com-
pose the rest of the board was

Hausman, jeff Delmontagne,

and Rebecca Veronis.

0Funding policies:

At the first meeting of the
new board in January, several
changes were made in the fund-
ing policies of the SGB.

Not only did the board vote
unanimously to fund social
events for governance groups
and the SGB, but it also decided
to fund promotional items for
advertising purposes.

The board also gave groups a
24-hour grace period following
the budget deadline and
assessed a 10 percent penalty to
the group's budget.

The new board worked hard
in trying to allocate money to
the student organizations rec-
ognized by the SGB. According
to DeLuca, the board was suc-
cessful with its job.

Word leaked out that Powers
and Delmontagne might be in
violation of their own constitu-
tion. The problem was that no
one knew if they were in viola-
tion or if the club was still a
recognized organization.

After some checking, DeLuca
found that the board members
were not guilty of any violation
and the club was active, but no
one could get in touch with the
president.

Perhaps it’s the size that
makes it seem intimidating.
.The figures, the acres, the total
amounts of everything at Pitt
are staggering.

The man responsible for run-
ning Pitt—a major university
with a budget of almost $300
million—’is Chancellor Wesley
Posvar.

The chancellor operates the
university like a mayor runs a
large city or an executive man-

gages a company. He supervises

every level, from finances to
public relations. He appoints
deans and faculty members and
grants tenure.

larly to the Board of Trustees,

The chancellor is also in
charge of securing resources to
fund various university pro—
grams or special projects. This
includes an annual trip to Har-

legislature for increased
appropriations.

-

--This is at least one space where you won’t get any --

public relations hype about the University of
Pittsburgh. '

It's not that we have anything against that sort of
thing; on the contrary, we believe self aggrandize-
ment can be an effective tool for the university. It got
us here, didn't it?

But you’ve probably had your fill of hearing how
much Pitt has to offer, the benefits ofa liberal educa-
tion, your purpose in life, ad infinitum, ad nau-
seurn, etc. I.

So with the infinite wisdom we’ve collected dur-
ing our years here, we sages will offer our advice
about making it at Pitt, keeping in mind that if
you’re like most people, you won’t take it anyway.

First, to answer your basic questions:

0 Is it fun here?

This depends on your definition of fun. If you
think ‘fun is watching people mud-wrestle in the
Schenley Quadrangle, life will be a’ real party.
There’s also crowded fraternity parties, crowded
dorm parties, crowded local bars and the crowded
student section of the football stadium. Have a good
time.

0 Do I have to go to class? ,

No. Basically, you don’t have to do anything you
don’t want-to do. What’s the university goingto do
about it? Ground you? But on the other hand, not
going to class, not studying, not passing your finals
and not graduating will probably mean not getting a
job. But it’s your life; do what you want.

O|Will I get along with my roommate?

Four years from now it won’t seem important.

‘ 0 How is the cafeteria food?

N/A

0 What should I wear to class?

If you really care, you should be at Chatham or
Duquesne. ' -

0 Will getting my degree help me find a job?

Sure. All you have to do is wave your diploma
under an employer’s nose and you’ll be guaranteed a
high paying,‘ upper-level job immediately upon
graduation. This is a certainty. And if you believe
that, we have -this bridge we want to sell...

0 Should I believe everything you’vejust told me?

Of cotirse not. That was our whole point. Despite
everything—all the assurances, the advice and the
criticism—-no one can tell you what college, or Pitt,
will be like. You can spend your four years (or more)
waiting for all the things you’ve heard to come true.
Or you can do what college is supposed to do in the
first place—teach you to_question—and go ahead
with your plans and ideas. We’re not saying that will
be easy, especially at a place that boasts an omnipres-
ent bureaucracy. Go ahead and try. A few years from
now, you may find yourself telling the same things
to new freshmen, hoping all the while that they
won’t believe it either.

Col|ege’s ‘Sinister’ Purpose

By IRWIN J. SCHULMAN
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences

. Nearly everyone who comes to
the College of Arts and Sciences has
a pretty good idea of what he or she
wants out of it. Most people think
of it as a place to learn a trade-
computer science, football, busi-
ness management, physical
therapy, or whatever. Some have
heard you can really have a good

' time h€‘I”6—-f()I‘ one thing, there’s a
roughly equal number of males
and females and Oakland offers
pleasures undreamed of in inno-
cent places like Penn Hills and

Bethel Park. _

The College, for its part, tries to
live up to students‘ expectations.
We will never have enough compu-
ter science sections to keep up with
the ever growing demand, but we

i do keep trying. A couple of years

ago we started a business major
that has proved to be popular and
successful. Our earnest devotion to
the amateur ideal in athletics has
been rewarded by the remarkable
success of our football teams in
recent years. We don’t keep statis-
tics on how socially satisfied our
students are, but our record is prob-
ably at least as good as the compu-
ter dating services and downtown
singles bars.

Orientation:
To Be Or
Not To Be

By CARL PALOWITCH
And DAVID AUGUSTINE

That is the question.

Now that Freshman Orientation
is upon us, new students may begin
to wonder why there is such a thing
as “()rientation." What's the use in
playing games, atteiitling confer-
ences, dancing in the Quad and
going to mentor meetings?

Twenty years ago, orientation
was nothing like it is today. The
new students would sit in the Syria

Btit deep down the college is not

institution it appears. It has its
own purposes that are often in con-
flict with the purposes of its stu-
dents. The “secret mission” of the
college is to make you into reflec-

tive and critical thinkers. Even as it
seems to offer you simple satisfac-
tions of one sort or another-—a
career, a girl or boyfriend and a
team worth rooting for——it is also
trying to make you dissatisfied.

Now for someone who arrives
here from'the typical high school,
such a purpose can be downright
sinister. In high school, people
who try to be reflective and critical
thinkers more often than not
acquire a reputation for trouble-
making. The secret of success in
school, as in nearly every bureau-
cratic environment,
summed up in three words: don’t
make waves.
. But a liberal arts college such as
ours welcomes independence, orig-
inality, questioning, criticism and
non-conformity. (May I remind
you, however, that a loud mouth by
itself is no proof of thoughtful-
ness.) Until now, as students in ele-
mentary and high school, you have
been mere sausage casings, which
your teachers have felt licensed to
stuff with whatever they thought
appropriate.

From here on, you must stop
being sausage casings and start
learning to be thinking human
beings. One of the first questions
you should ask is: isn’t there more
to life than a good job. sexual ful-
fillment and a team to root for?

A university is not simply a per-
sonnel processing plant, a sort of
glorified employment agency thak
recruits and trains people for all or
society’s roles. It stands apart from
society, and has a greater attach-
ment to the truths of the past and
the possibilities of the future than
it does to the realities of the present.

The college, as the heart of the
university, seeks to communicate
these values to its students. The
education it offers, liberal educa-
tion, is an education for freedom.
Freedom does not mean merely the
absence of imposed restraints. It
means also a’ view of life that goes
beyond the mere satisfaction of
cravings, the well-paying job, the
vibrant social life, the approval of
one’s peers and boss and two weeks.

Human nature and its possibili-
ties are not exhausted in the roles
we play or thejobs we hold. Liberal
education is a voyage of discovery
into what it means to be human. It
is a label for all the ways we can
seek to learn about ourselves and
the world around us, so that is
knowing these truths we can
become free.

I called this purpose of the col-
lege ‘.‘sinister” and I meant it. Peo-
ple have been killed for asking
questions. At the very least‘ the
habit of doubting, analy'1.ing, crit-
icizing will cause you to suffer
from a kind of gnawing discontent
for the rest of your lives. The dis-
content is, however, the price we
pay for learning to be truly human.

To be a freshman again. What an
experience! It is a time for meeting
new friends, getting lost and con-
fused, getting used to being away
from home, probably for the first
time, partying and, of course,
learning to study the college way
instead of the high school way.

The freshmen year can be both a
positive and negative experience.
There are events that will cause the
new students to thoroughly enjoy
his first year at college and of
course things will occur that could
bring disappointments. The latter
may occur through situations
beyond the student’s control, and
some of them will be created by the
student.

There is an old adage that col-

lege is what one makes it. So it goes
at Pitt. Naturally it is assumed that
all students are here to learn—to
get an education that will lead
them to lucrative jobs and prosper-
our lives. It takes four or more years
of dedication to a discipline to
accomplish such success, and some
students may not even find the suc-
cess they want after matriculation.

It is different from the high
school experience; perhaps that is
the first lesson that the new stu-
dents should learn upon starting
college.

Getting used to being away from
home for the first time is difficult
for some students, even those who
commute from nearby homes. The
course load can be heavy, the
classes can be rather large, causing
professors to get to know few stu-
dents personally, and the adminis-

The ‘Disease’OfThe
Commuter Student

By CHRISTI NA CLINTON

For two long, lonely years, I
was a member of Pitt’s most
discriminated—against major-
ity. I couldn’t help the afflic-
tion I was born with nor the fact
that my parents were middle
class and I could not afford to
go anywhere else. I had to real-
ize that I had a disease and learn
to live with it. I was a
commuter.

This year’s invasion of fresh-
man and President Reagan’s
financial aid cuts will bring a
whole new flock of commuters
to the university, a whole new
“class” of people who will often
feel unwanted and unloved.

It’s not the people who live
off-campus that I am writing of,
but the people who live on the
outskirts of the city, like I did.
The ones who have to transfer
downtown or drive in rush hour
traffic to make their first class.
The real commuters.

PAT buses, university park-
ing (or lack of), downtown con-
struction, fast food lunches and
the inability to make friends are
all a part of the commuter’s life.

Pitt’s residents and others

cannot possibly imagine the
headaches commuters have to
put up with everyday. They are
insurmountable. Having to
wait four hours in the Com-
mons Room between classes,
not attending meetings at night
because you’re too tired to drive
back to Oakland and finding
quarters for the meters or the
bus are only some of the hassles
commuters must face.

But perhaps the biggest diffi-
culty I found being a commuter
was the inability to make
friends. When you're a resident,
you have your roommate or the
people on your floor to be with.
You can also find the time to
join extra—curricular activities.

Commuters, on the other
hand, have to rely on high
school acquaintances or class-
mates for conversation during
the day. By the time the end of
the day rolls around, most com-
muters are too tired to go to
meetings or participate in other
activities. So where does one go
to make a friend?

Well, there's always Burger

trative red tape that is often
necessary in such a large institu-
tion can be burdensome.

The freshman year can some-
times set the trend a student will
follow for the next four years.

As our welcome to Pitt, we
have borrowed from the words
of Napoleon Hill and W. Cle-
ment Stone, authors of “Success
Through a Positive Mental
Attitude.”

“Remember——your world
will change whether or not you
choose to change it. But you
have the power to choose its
direction. You can select your
own targets.”

This proviso is particularly
descriptive of the collegiate
experience. » _

We encourage you to explore
the world of Student Activities
as you embark on your college
career. There are many targets
to choose from, all of which
will offer you oppotunities to
learn, to meet others, to test
yourself, to contribute and to
achieve. All you have to do is
decide.

We concur with the authors
that all worthwhile‘-achieve-
merits starts with definiteness
of purpose. To assist you, we
have sponsored the "Emerging
Leader Program, the Freshman
Interest Survey and. Student
Activity Fair, at which you can
review over 100 campus organi-

zations that serve as vehicles for
involvement in campus life.

Major amongst these groups
are the organizations advised by
the Office of Student Activities.
These incltide: the Student
Government Board and its
eight standing committees,
social fraternities ‘ and sorori-
ties, the Pitt Program Council,
Black Action Society, The Pitt
News \/VPGH Radio, Backspace
literary magazine and the
Panther Prints Yearbook.

Now under renovation sched-
uled for completion in Sep-
tember, l983, the Student
Union is the heart of campus
activities and serves as the cen-
ter for the Division of Student
Affairs.

In summary the Office of Stu-
dent Activities provides the stu-
dent body with a comprehen-
sive extra and co—curricular
program and opportunities for
personal and educational devel-
opment outside of the
classroom. ‘

We hope that you decide t0
join us and make student activi-
ties part of your changing
world.

Good times and good
grades can go hand-in-
hand if a student learns
right away when to study
and when to play.

Friends can be made that will lasta

Good times and good grades can
go hand-in—hand if a student learns
right away when to study and when
to play. The result of too much

partying and not enough studying
should be obvious!

Even though the number one
priority here should be academics,
it should not be a student’s concern
in total. There is much more to the
college environment and it pro-
vides as much opportunity to learn
as does the classroom itself. Learn-
ing outside the classroom takes
place in various forms, particularly
extracurricular involvement.

Participation in an extracurricu-
lar activity gives a student the
opportunity to learn things that
often are not available through the
curriculum. There are activities
offered through clubs and organi-
zations on the Pitt campus that
cover practically every conceivable
arena—from sports. religion.

muters do not even have that
privilege.

At the risk of sounding mun-
dane, commuters need to get
involved in the university.
Although you may be tired or
mad or indifferent, take the
time to join something that
interests you. It’s the only way
you may keep some semblance
of sanity if you are a commuter.
Even, God forbid, go to frater-
nity parties on the weeekends.
Above all, be friendly. Strike up
conversations with students in
your class, especially other
commuters. If nothing else, you
can complain to one another

towards the program and the way it
is planned. We cannot force
anyone to learn about the univer-
sity, but we can create an atmos-
phere that makes it fun!

We hope the orientatioti of '82 is

an improvement over the prograin
of 20 years ago in the Syria Mosque.
Orientation can bejust as boringas
it was then if the students don’t
take advantage of all the opportun-
ities offered. No matter how well
we plan or prepare an orientation
program, nothing will be absorbed
if the students lack a spirit of
discovery.

Orientation '82 has been
planned so that the new students

can learn about the university (and.

have fun at the same time), meet
some of their new classmates, think
about why they are here, and also
have time to “settle in" before the
start of classes. We hope everyone
uses orientation as a tool to start off
college on the right foot. Good
luck!!

muting does have a bright side.
While‘ the residents are eating
that slop they call food in the
cafeteria, you will be getting a
good home cooked meal most
nights. While the Towers’ resi-
dents will be sleeping in a room
shaped like a piece of pie, you
will have your own spacious
room free of roaches and you
will not have to share a
bathroom with 20 strangers.
You can go to bars and other
night spots that are not filled
with just college students and
professors. You can meet real
people. If you own a car, you
can get away from dreary Oak-
land at the turn of a key and not

others.

Perhaps the single most benefi-'

cial aspect of participation in_an
extracurricular activity is learning
to work with others. No matter
what profession a student pursues,
he will be working with people.
Regardless of the academic back-

difficult to succeed in that
profession.

of being a commuter is the
price. You don't have to pay
rent, utilities or buy your own
food. That means you can buy
an_extra pair of jeans or_another
pitcher of beer and not worry
about where your next meal is
coming from.

The times that you commute
will be rough but keep your
chin tip. It can be done sanely
and without much pain if you
approach it with the right atti-
tude. Just do what I did when I
got depressed. Laugh at all the
poor people who have to go
back to their rooms to face the
roommate they cannot stand
while you go home to your own
room, where you can lock the
door and not see anyone until
the next day.

lt’s likely that at least one of the following situations will arise during the first month of
school: After studying for 45 minutes you won’t be able to look at the books a second longer;
your roommate will talk loudly on the phone or play the same song over and over for two hours,
driving you insane; you’ll actually be hungry after a delicious -cafeteria meal.

What do you do in cases like these? The Pitt News has anticipated at least some of your
questions and has come up with the following guide. It contains information about where to go
to soothe the spirit, stimulate the brain, wet the appetite and still leave enough left over to buy

books. Presenting...

Freshman
Survival

  Guide 

If the cafeteria’s breaded bread
with tasteless canned vegetables
doesn’t sound appetizing, or if you
find yourself with some extra cash,
you might want to go out for a bite to
eat. Of course, eateries are few and
far between in Oakland——there are
only about 40 places serving food in
the immediate area.- For those who
find themselves standing with gap-
ing mouths in the face of such a wide
variety of choices, read on.

Before pounding the pavements
in search of food, it helps to know
what is and isn’t available. For
instance, Oakland isn’t the best
place in the world to get fresh sea-
food. However, if you’re in search of
the- perfect hamburger, you’ve
come to the right place. On-Forbes
Avenue, there’s Roy Roger’s and
McDonald’s. We'ndy’s and

Burgers-King canbe found on Fifth .

Avenue. As a last resort, there’s
Burger--Chef in the basement of the
Cathedral, but only as a last resort.

‘If you’re looking for'fas't_-food but
not for a burger, there are a couple
of fast food places serving other vic-
tuals. Arby’s, on Forbes Avenue,
and Kentucky Fried Chicken on
the Bouvelard of the Allies are two
that come to mind. There’s also
George Aiken’s, with foods fried in
the oldest and tastiest grease
around. The Original Oyster
House on Forbes has the obvious

fare, as does Taco Vista, located

_ right down ‘the street. Cornucopia
 "features" vegetarian delights" served

Where To Eat

right next to the King’s Court
Theatre. \

lt’s likely that no one has gradu-
ated from Pitt without visiting The
Original Hot Dog Shop, better

.known as the “O.” It features hot

dogs, french fries and subs, and it’s
open until 3:50 a.m. during the week
and 4:50 a.m. on the weekends.
For fast food that’s not junk food,
try My Place on Oakland Avenue.
It features Greek dishes, home-

made soup and the world famous.»

spinach roll. Subs and other long
sandwiches are available at Blim-
pie’s on Forbes at Semple Street
and the Subway on Oakland
Avenue. Sweeny’s Deli, next to
Forbes Hall, has an interesting vari-
ety of sandwiches on the menu and
also ‘offers made-to-order
sandwiches, ,
For those who don’t like meat;
there’s the ‘Salad Company on.
Atwood, as well as. Cornucopia,

in a pleasant, relaxed .atmosphere,—
although it’s more expensive than
its neighbor. . '
What would college be without.
beer and pizza? There are a number
of pizzerias in the area, all of which
can quickly be found in the Yellow
Pages, so only a few will be men-
tioned here. In South Oakland, two
of the best places are rumored to be
Larry and Carol’s, on Semple
Street, and Sorrento’s on Atwood.

Domino’s has free delivery andfree
coke, but it’s a little more expensive.
Another popular place is Bellisa-
rio-’s, which is close to campus, on
Fifth Avenue. 1

Since Oakland is a melting pot of
nationalities and cultures, there are
a number of restaurants serving for-
eign fare. Bamboo Garden on
Forbes and House of Chiang on
McKee Place are the two local Chi-
nese restaurants. The Taj Mahal
on Oakland Avenue features Indian
food, and Middle Eastern cuisine is
available at Khalil’s on Forbes at
Oakland and the Babylon Restau-
rant on Atwood Street.

Inexpensive fine dining is featured
at Frankie Gustine’s on Forbes
"and its neighbor, C J Barney's. C J
Barney's has 17 varieties of ham-

burgers, aswell as French onion .
__ soup, quiche and .~.=Mexican food. ‘

iiWhere To Drink  

~ fl"rm-2,.-you need _'..t'oe'at to stay,

 alive; but what’s' the fun of being

alive .if you can’t drink? Along with

own character and ‘clientele. So," if

. you.;.don’t believe in studying, try hit-~

ting a differentbar and a different
special each weeknight. Here's

MONDAY: The Sanctuary, with
entrances on Bouquet Street and
Oakland Avenue has a draft beer
special, along with one of the only
dance floors in Oakland. Discos
may be dying out, but the Sanctuary
is still going strong.

TUESDAY: Another special at
the Sanctuary, this time beer and
pizza. Tuesday is also quarter beer
night at Zelda’s Greenhouse on
Bouquet Street from 8 to 12.

WEDNESDAY: Believe it or not,
the-Sanctuary has a special on Wed-
nesday, too, but this time it’s ladies
night. At Zelda's Happy Hour goes
from 4 ’til 11.

THURSDAY: This is probably
the most popular weeknight to go
Out because Oakland is full of spe-
cials. The Sanctuary has haif price
drinks, and Zelda's features “Beat

try the Decade on Atwood Street.

around and the price is right.

South Oakland has a couple of
bars not frequented as heavily by
students as some of those already
mentioned. Two of these are the.
SOD, and Danny’s Pub, a typical
neighborhood bar on Oakland
Avenue. The only time Danny’s is
inundated with students is on St.
Patrick’s Day.

Places to drink in North Oakland
include the Luna at Craig and Cen-

ter, and Mitchell’s, at Centre and 

Meiwood, both of which are popular
with fraternities and sororities.

Not to be missed is Mr. C’s on
Forbes, mainly because you can
have the dance floor to yourself
most of the time. Finally, there’s the
Pitt Tavern, a bar you’ll probably
walk by but never walk into on your
way to Burger King.

Life In The Crowded Lane

The Quad is a popular meeting place.

You’ve just moved into your
room and are wondering how in the
world you’re supposed to fit every-
thing you own into so little space.
The first thing you should do is relax
and accept the fact that whatever
won’t fit will have to be either
shipped home or thrown away.
Throwing stuff away is probably the
easiest solution; at least you won’t
‘have to worry about lugging it home.

There are many things about life
in the residence halls that will always
be annoying. Living with someone
whose very presence makes you
twitch is one of those. Sois sharing a
bathroom with the immediate
world. Also on the list are hearing
every move your next door neigh-
bor makes (the one who sets his
alarm clock but leaves before it goes
off), and trying to sign in a friend
who has no lD. But cheer up, things
could be worse. College could last
six years instead of four.

As irritating as dorm life can be,
there are times when it’s really a lot
of fun. lt’s also much easier to han-
dle when you know how things are
run (or not run), and what the rules
of the game are.

One important thing to realize is
that you’re not stuck with your
roommate for life, or even for the
school year. If you’re having prob-
lems, ‘try confronting your room-
mate first. It usually helps if the
person realizes what he or she is
doing to make you clench your fists
and bite your pillow.-

lf , talking to your roommate
doesn’t resolve the problem, try
talking to your RA. That’s what RAs
are there for and they’re usually glad
to help. If the situation is still unbear-
able, either you or your roommate
can request a room switch.
Remember, there must be other
people who hate each other as
much as you do. Your RA will be
able to help you follow the proper
steps and fill out the proper forms
for .obtaining another room.

Another important fact to realize
is that the elevator situation only
gets worse, not better. The begin-
ning of fall term is when the eleva-
tors are in good repair. Wait ’til you
see what they’re like in February.

~ The best way to handle the eleva-
tor situation is to find another way to
get from your room to the lobby.
The stairs are usually the best way
to do this, especially since jumping
out the window is frightening and
the windows in the Towers don’t
open. Keep in mind that elevators in
the Towers only stop at every third
ﬂoor, if you’re lucky.

Those who live in a residence hall
other than one of the Towers should
consider themselves fortunate,
because their windows open. Tow-
ers residents will have to find some
other way to get fresh air. They can
always leave the building or move to
another hall. Leaving the building is

faster, especially since the other
places are already full.

If you can’t open your window,
you’ll want some way, beside
screaming, to communicate with
the outside world. Try the phone.
To call anywhere on-campus, just
dial the four digit extension number.
For outside calls, dial 91 followed by
the number (exchange and exten-
sion) you want. The operator can be
reached by dialing 91-0.

If your phone isn’t working prop-
erly, telephone repair can be
reached by dialing 91-611. However,
if your phone mysteriously stops
working, it probably means you
haven’t paid your bill. Try paying it,
but don’t be surprised if you also
have to pay a $35 reconnection fee.
The phone company business
number is 91-682-5222.

What happens it you can’t pay
your phone bill and don’t have use of
a phone? You’ll have to resort to
writing letters. Cheer up; campus
mail is free. Mailrooms are located in
the lobby of Tower B for the Towers
and the Quad and the lobbies of
Lothrop and Forbes. Packages can
be mailed and received only in the
Tower B mailroom from 9 a.m. to 4
p.m. Monday through Friday.
Stamps are also available there.

One of the most frustrating and
interesting aspects of living in the
dorms is attempting to do laundry.
lt’s frustrating because there’s usu-
ally’a wait for the machines, espe-
cially in the Towers. it’s interesting
because there are always a few guys
indiscreetly consulting directions
written by their mothers. They’ll
usually ask some silly questions, like
how much soap to put in the dryer.

If you live in Towers, you might
wonder how it’s possible for so
many people to use the one laundry
room in the lobby. Believe it or not,
it is possible, but only if you like to
wash your clothes at 4 a.m. Other
laundry rooms are conveniently
located on the top level of buildings
in the Quad and on each floor in
Bruce, Forbes, and Lothrop.
Change machines are located in the
Towers lobby.

Even though you will eventually
have to do laundry, you won’t have
to wash your sheets if you don’t
mind using linen‘supplied by the
Housing Office. Linen exchange
takes place in the lobby of Tower B
for the Towers and Quad, in the
basement of Lothrop and on the
second floor of Forbes Hall. The ser-
vice is available on Mondays and
"Fridays, 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. and
Wednesdays from 8:30 a.m. until
12:30 p.m.

If something should happen to
break in your room, you have three
choices. You can learn to live with it,
fix it, or contact maintenance. The
first two are probably the easiest,
but if you can’t live with it and you’re
not handy, you’ll have to muddle
through some red tape before what-
ever is broken gets fixed.

To attempt to get something

repaired, go to the.main desk of
your building. and fill out a mainte-
nance request slip. Then wait. And
wait some more. Then fill out
another form. Then wait. Then
either give up or go back to the first
two choices. ln an emergenéy,
either pray or tell the Towers desk
(x4169) and ask for the engineer
who is on duty 24 hours a day.

The desks in the residence halls
can be alternately useful and annoy-
ing. They’re useful for things like
borrowing cleaning equipment or
asking questions. They’re annoying
when the attendants deligently
enforce the visitation policy. 9

Visitors when the proper identifi-
cation are allowed in the residence
halls between 8 a.m. and 2 a.m.
Monday through Friday, and from 8
a.m. Friday to 2 a.m. Monday morn-
ing._They must be escorted by their
host or hostess while in the building
since the person who signs them in
is responsible for them.

Overnight- guests or those who
stay past 2 a.m. Monday through
Friday must be aimember of the
same sex as the resident, except for
members of the resident’s imme-
diate family. That’s it. If you’re
wondering why grown men and
women can’t_ decide for themselves
who should stay _in the rooms for
which they pay large sums of
money, forget it. The question has
already been asked. Other ques-
tions can be directed to the Office of
Residence Life or your RA.

Because the visitation policy is
enforced and security is tight, it’s
essential that you hold onto your ID
card and room key. Keeping your
key on hand ‘at all times will save you
time, trouble, and money—keys
cost $10 to replace. If you lose your
key or it is stolen, call the Housing
Office (x4160) during working hours
or the Towers desk after 5 p.m.

Do not, under any circumstance,
lose, mutilate or allow your ID car to
be stolen. If you do, you must report
it immediately to the Meal Ticket
Office in the Towers Lobby and be
prepared to pay $10 for a new card.
Mistakes-cost money at Pitt.

All residents except those living in
Forbes, McCormick and Bruce Hall
have the option of painting their
rooms. Free paint and supplies may
be obtained by filling out a paint
request form (of course) available in
the maintenance office in the base-
ment of the Towers.

The one drawback to this system
is that you are restricted to the six
university paint colors. Painting
your room is probably easier than
moving out of it, and since it’s so
small, there’s not too much work
involved.

Living in the residence halls is a
challenge. If you can make it
through without once throwing a
temper tantrum or wishing you were
back home being smothered by
your parents, you’re one in a million.
Considering the 30,000 students
enrolled at Pitt, that's pretty good.

The 0

You might as well get used to
the looks of this place. If you’re
like most Pitt students, you'll be
spending a lot of your free time
at the ‘'‘Original,’’ also known
as the “Dirty 0.”

And with , good reason.
There's nothing quite as tini-
que as the “O” dog, especially
at 2 a.m. on a Saturday. Even
more fun to eat is the “O” brand
of pizza, which is not only
cheap, but has the kind of
cheese on top that slides from
side to side when you carry it.

Other fun things at the ‘‘O''
are the extremely large
bouncers, the ever popular col-
lection of video games and, of
course, the clientele.

Some people really like this
place. But then again, some
people like to wear deely
boopers.

, This person is probably the
only student on campus who is
constantly followed by adoring
females with fluffy blonde hair
and high plastic shoes who
would kill to do his laundry or
homework for him.

This is none other than
Oakland-bred Dan Marino,
who has done more for the
admissions office than a mil-
lion shiny brochures.

If you can't find him on cam-
pus, (that's hard considering he
travels with an entourage the
size of Bianca Jagger's) then try
catching him on network TV
saying something original like,
“Hi, Mom,” or whatever foot-
ball players say when the cam-
‘era’s on them.

Larry Lunsford has the envi-

four campus media: The Pitt

That job used to mean
thwarting attempted libel suits,
avoiding cost overruns caused
by students unafraid of stealing
Watts lines and dealing with
tempermental budding
“artists.” A

Now, of course, Lunsford
also gets to pay for any graffiti
that marks the unwashable

penthouse. At least it’s literary
graffiti; where else but the

Schulman

College of Arts and Sciences
dean Irwin Schulman kept
himself busy much of last year
battling to reform Pitt’s under-
graduate curriculum.

The reforms were eventually

approved by the Faculty of Arts '

and Sciences, but not before
Schulman had the pleasure of
sitting through faculty meetings
which included such lively
debates as what the definition or
a non-Western culture should
truly be. .

When he’s not fighting for
foreign language requirements,
Schulman is deciding the aca-
demic fate of many a student
who has skipped too many
classes or gotten too involved in
extra-curricular actvities like,
say, writing for The Pitt News.

Schulman is the one to see if
you get thatlittle notice about
academic probation. Just be
quick to get the mail before
your parents see it.

You know all that stuff you
keep getting in the mail from
Pitt? With lectures about what
college is like? -Well, credit it to
(or blame it on) this man.

Bob Firth is the coordinator
of New Student Programs at
Pitt. That means he’s responsi-
ble for organizing the orienta-
tion program, Provost’s day
and other programs for new or
prospective students.

In addition, Firth is in charge
of all those mentors. You know,
people you keep seeing who are

Those are mentors. They're
quite nice during orientation
and will even occasionally
acknowledge you during the
school year.

Todd
DeLuca

Todd DeLuca is the latest in
the line of Delta Tau Delta fra-
ternity members to hold the
office of Student Government
Board president.

DeLuca heads the nine
member board that decides on
allocations for student groups
and is the student voice in admi-
nistrative decisions. Actually, it
passes resolutions and makes
recommendations that are duti-
fully ignored by administrators.
It sounds good, however, to say
the board is the student voice.

You'll’ get a chance to see
your student leader at the picnic

intimidated. It doesn't really
matter that he's rather well-
known and you are unrecogniz-

Dana?
Polan

‘Dana Polan has the unique
distinction of being the only
professor on the campus who
truly understands his students.
If you can manage to sign up for
one of his classes, which‘ must
be done at least a year in
advance, you are assured of not
only learning something, but
having a good time in the proc-
ess. Dana, as he is known to all
his students, is known for his
grandiose choice of movies
shown in his "mm studies
courses.

Last term, the undeniable
favorite was that true classic,

“It’s Alive," which, if you don't '

already know, was about an
infant who killed people and
lived in the sewers of Los
Angeles. This year, rumor has it
that classics like “Beach
Blanket Bingo” and “I Was A
Teen-Age Werewolf” will be a
part of the curriculum.

Sometimes Dana teaches an
English course that includes lis-
tening to the Sex Pistols and
watching “I Love Lucy”
among its activities.

‘ If you’re one of the many try-
ing to get into a class of Dana’s
late, pop up to his office on the
5th floor of the Cathedral and
talk a lot about his two favorite
movies, “The Cat People" (the
original, not the Natassia
Kinski remake), and “Rock and
Roll High School.” Maybe, just
maybe, he‘ll be impressed
enough to let you in.

There’s lots more to do at Pitt
beside studying and socializing.
Within a five mile radius, there’s
enough going on to keep you busy
from now until April. The best part is
that you can do it all under_$5.

For those who don’t want to ven-
ture far, the Pitt Program Council
sponsors films every week at the
price ofjust $1 for Pitt students with
a valid ID. The films are shown in the
David Lawrence auditorium. For
schedules and information, call 624-
3344.

In addition to films, the Program

events. Included in September’s
schedule are Dr. John’s Frisbee
Show on the Cathedral lawn on
August 31, an outdoor concert by
David Bromberg on Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley Park at 2.p.m. on Sep-
tember 12, classical dramatic read-
ings by Frank Fowle III on
September 17, a debate between G.

EDIE: AN AMERICAN BIO-
CRAPHY

By Jean Stein, edited with George
Plimpton

Alfred Knopf, $16.95

It can do you in—reading about
Edie Sedgewick, that is. The hype,
the hustling, the drugs, the all-
nighters, the leather rhino (you'll
have to read the book for that
one), but most of all Edie, just Edie
and all the people who were Edie.
People like Paul America, Billy
Name, Andy Warhol, Truman
Capote, Norman Mailer, Alan
Ginsberg and Viva. The Velvet
Underground. The sixties
recreated through the life of a
mini-celebrity who did nothing at
all to be famous except live in a
tradition. A person who once said
of herself, "The real Edie is where
the fast cars, the fast horses and
people doing things are."

But who was she? The daughter
of a wealthy American family that

its money——back through the
pages of American history to the
revolution. Edie. She spent
$80,000 in six months. Wore black
tights and made them fashionable.
The star of "Vinyl" and "Ciao!
Manhattan.” A member of Andy
Warhol's clique-ish Factory. Star
of underground films that glam-
ourized her, Edie Sedgewick.

Despite all the glamour, the
glitter and the incredible accounts
of a drug addiction that rival "The
Naked Lunch," "Edie: An Ameri-
can Biography" is truly that : a
biography of a persn brought up
to personify the American dream
of sixties youth. Told in short
excerpts from the people who
knew her best, "Edie" is more than
just the life of one person, a single
mini-celebrity who lived for who
she was, the Edie on the Screen

could trace its roots——and most of .

nu

edie    

- , ,»1§,\,~«

and the Edie of the Magazines——

Media Edie.

This work also chronicles the

' whole Sedgewick way of life; the

women, the money, the constant
pressure to live up to the heights

of the Sedgewick name.

The depravity of too much her-
itage, too much money, too much
in the way of good looks; the real
depravity of this clan is shown
through Duke Sedgewick, Edie’s
father. He was the way of life. A

  

man so forceful and feared that
his eldest son committed suicide
because he did not believe himself
manly enough to meet his father's
expectations. A man who's narcis-
sism went beyond his face and
body; he strutted around the fam-

i

ily’s spacious California ranch
nearly nude in a tiny a jock strap.

Duke Sedgewick preferred
younger women—wives of
friends, friends of his children, his
own daughters. (His sculptor's
studio was to become, over the
years, a bizarre rogue’s gallery of
the many women he'd seduced.)
Incest was nothing new to the
Sedgewick way of life. Saucie,
Edie’s older sister, talks about the
time her father made a pass at her.
Later, Edie’s brother Jonathan
tells about the time Edie tried to
talk him into bed. ‘

For a work on a media child, a
person who, without Warhol and
the Factory, without thesixties all
together would have never
existed, "Edie" is an American Bi-
ography in form and content. The
format of conversational, first-
hand recollections gives a supris-
ingly lifelike picture of Edie—whc
she was, what she did. Best of all,
however, is that not only Edie
comes alive in the pages of Jean
Stein's book, but also the people
who followed her and worshipped
her. Even in their speech you can
still see how cool they're trying to
be—how with it.

The surprising thing about thi
book is that it also presents an
interesting picture of Andy War-
hol. Through the New York pop
years, Andy was Edie’s person.
She opened doors into segments
of society that he couldn't get
through before. He made her the
object of his films, introduced her
to his friends and a different,
drugged-out life style. He gave
her a sort of destructive security
by making her famous for more
than 15 minutes.

"Edie" is the story of life in the
sixties for a person with too much
money, too much style, to much
flair, too much beauty and no
sense of boundaries. An American
biography for sure.

KEITH RICHARDS, LIFE AS A
ROLLING STONE

By Barbara Charone
Doubleday Dolphin,
(approx.)

$9.99

Keith Richards. The devil or a
saint? This is a question that's
been on the minds of all of us for
years, ranking right up there with
which came first, the chicken or
the egg? But seriously, folks (pre-
suming one can take anything
having to do with rock and roll’
seriously), philosophilizing about
that walking cadaver of a guitar
player is a great pastime among
those who adhere to the rock and
roll lifestyle voyeuristically.

You have to admit that he's by
far the most interesting person in
the Rolling Stones, much less
among his peers like Eric Clapton

or Pete Townshend. About the

only thing that keeps people read-

ing about Jagger is to find out

what glam model he's been seen

with at Regine's or whether he

and Bianca still speak to one

another; Ron Wood is shoved to

the back because he joined the

group only a few years ago and is

seen as little more than Rod Stew-

art's ex-girlfriend who looks like a

Keith clone; Bill Wyman and

Charlie Watts? Who cares? But

Keith, now there's someone you

can really sink you teeth into, so to

speak.

The drug busts, Anita, Marlon,

itowase all just 
oQo°°o°°innoCent  :30

the drug busts, the haircut, the
Chuck Berry style similarities, the
drug busts, the drug busts, the
drug busts. He makes good copy.
Even my mother can report his
activities verbatim simply because
he makes the news so often.

Unlike Jagger, who seems to
love/hate publicity so much and
often seems to generate his own
purposefully, Keith never seems
to try to get his name spread
around—it’s like these things just
happen to him and there's nothing
he can do about it. Which leads us
to "Keith Richards,Life As A Roll-
ing Stone"...

Although this book was origi-
nally published a while back over-
seas, it has just now become
available to American rock and
roll junkies (no pun intended), and
Stones fanatics which include all
people between the ages of 12 and
40. If, like me, you're something of
a Stones aficianado, Barbara Cha-
rone's book is a must-—just as
important as "Up And Down With
The Rolling Stones," and, for the
Bruce crazies, "Born To Run."

It's not as slimy as "Up And
Down," but it still contains vital
information about our beloved
Keith, a lot of which comes from
his mother, Doris, who seems to
be her son's greatest admirer and
asset. There are tidbits here about
his childhood and familial rela-
tionships that l've never read any-
where else (and, seeing as my

crowd.

o
co

personal motto is "Keith Richards
is God," I've read it all), along with
the usual chronological stuff
about How The Stones Began and
Evolved, which we've all heard
before. There's even an array of
bitchy talk about Bianca forthose
of you who just can't get enough
of the Steve Rubell Studio 54

The picture presented of Keith
is definitely a positive one; Cha-
rone is much like Dave Marsh
("Born To Run") in the way she
idolizes and respects her subject.
According to her, he's a devoted
father who dressed up like Santa
Claus for his kids on Christmas
and who treats his mum like
royalty.

The heroin addiction is talked
about, but is never made to over-
shadow the man's enormous con-
tribution to his art, something
which seems to happen in real life.

So, what can I say? Most of you
are either gonna buy this book
because Keith is a hero/villain and
you love him, no matter what I
say, or else you're not because you
couldn't care less. But even for the
borderline Keith freaks who can't
yet name all of the solo songs
Keith sings on Stones albums, and
who don't know about his passion
for water rat shooting, this bi-
ography is essential.

THE DISGUSTING, DESPICA-
BLE CAT COOKBOOK

John P. Eaton and Julie Kurnitz
New Century Publishers, $3.95

Another in a long line of I-hate-
anything books, authors John P.
Eaton and Julie Kurnitz show how
to write a book and get it pub-
lished with little talent or work
required. Obviously cashing in on
Simon Bond's witty "101 Uses For
A Dead Cat," Eaton and Kurnitz
didn't even try for totally sick

humor in "The Disgusting, Despi-
cable Cat Cookbook," but rather,
seemed to rummage the kitchen
shelves of a modern up-to-date,
nowaday, a—go—go woman to get
the glossy, easy-to-prepare
recipes (so in with working cou-
ples), and added a cat for the main
ingredient.

Aside from some cute jokes, and
a couple wittily entitled dishes (a
recipe for Tempurra), this- book is
mostly bland. While the recipes

purrfectl

gusting, or despicable enough to

are entirely cookable, minus the
cat if you're a vegetarian, most
were obviously concocked to
make a pun. In the recipe for
"Bagged Cat," the final line-after
a list of ingredients including cab-
bage, carrots, vinegar, onions,
green pepers and half a cat, placed
in a bag punctured several times
with a fork to let steam escape
while baking at 350 degrees for
one hour-—tells to "...let cat out of
bag/"Er, ha, ha.

While appealing packaged—the

cover is a funny-gross drawing of
a charred black cat holding apple
in its mouth and surrounded by a
circle of onions on a bed of parsley
that's entitled "Standing Cat
Roast," and including a few clever
ideas that just let themselves
loosen up and not be so fanatical-
"The Cat Cookbook"just isn't dis-

make it a worthwhile buy.

When two bands the caliber of J.

Elvis Costello's face breaks into
a joyous smile as his tumultous
Attractions pounds through the
opening chords of ”Pump It Up.”
Elvis is simply ecstatic, and his
sweet-soaked admirers are con-
inced that he couldn't possibly be
faking his excitement.
Where is that angry, obsessed
misanthrope who infamously
ripped through 50-minute con-
erts displaying contempt for his
audience, or else failed to
acknowledge them altogether?
What is he celebrating here? How
did this man get (so) happy?l!
Having not played Pittsburgh
since 1977, Elvis burst upon the
stage before anyone could even
notice that the lights had gone
down, and began urgently with
”Oh, I just don’t know where to
begin...,” the opening of ”Acci-
dents Will Happen.” And for the
next two hours he took the
audience by force and surprise,

The Clash

icence of

Motels have a top five hit as we
speak. I can't imagine what could
have seduced you to stay away,
but it must’ve been something
mind—shattering or (mind-
altering), because, as usual, I.
Ceils put on quite a show.

Peter Wolf is a helluva per-
former. Really. Whenever I think
of the years 1980-82, l’ll think of
him: zebra shoes, ever—changing
headgear and cool clothes all
arranged on the Ichabod Crane
body of his. But more than the
visual aspect, which is mighty
impressive, that Style is what’ll be
imprinted forever. The way he
shucks and jives around the stage
like it's the main pulpit of the
Peter Wolf Church of Unrepent-
ing Sinners and he's the founder,

 

armed by the ferocity of the
Attractions and the sheer magnif-

”Imperial Bedroom,’
which brought cheers upon
mention.

The band covered over 40 big
hits (yes folks, count ’em, FORTY)
highlighted by the fresh keyboard
arrangements of Steve Nieve,
which replaced the usual lead gui-
tar inserts, and Elvis’ rhythm gui-
tar powered with Steve Thomas’
bass.

But, of course, the main instru-
ment is his emotional voice, which
is strong and self-assured.
Whether it caressed the lovely
”Allison,” or bit into the frenzied
demands of ”You Belong To Me,”
he knew exactly which of his clas-
sic lines to emphasize, leaving
them to linger in the air with the
crowd's reaction (”And it's the
damage that we do and never
know/It's the words we don’t say
that scare me so.")

His various influences were
apparent in the diversity of the
songs, and also in the several cov-
ers. The O’]ays ”Back Stabbers”

I

which, of course, he is.

His famous onstage patter is so
fire and brimstone that it's impos-
sible not to think of him as the
Oral Roberts of rock and roll.
Damn, I wish he would show up in
flowing robes on the altar of my
childhood church—l’d be a devout
church-goer for the rest of my
life. As it stands, though, we'll just
have to settle for the occasional
mass at a hockey rink every tour,
which is still something we should
be thankful for. As you've already
guessed, this isn't your typical
this-is-who—they-are—and-this—is—
what-they-played review. Yeah,
they placed all the big hits, and
yeah, everybody stood on their
seats and practically had orgasms
when ”Freeze Frame” or ”Center—

 

led into ”King Horse,” and Sonny
Boy Wilkliamson’s ”Help Me” fit
somehow into the middle of a
haunting version of ”Watching
The Detectives,” complete witha
shadowy visual effect of white
lights projecting from behind him.

Elvis’ encore exit turned out to
be more like a two-minute inter-
mission, because his assault was
only half over. Elvis and the crowd
fed off of each other’s energy for
another fifteen songs. By normal
concert standards the show was
over, but Elvis was clearly sticking
around for the fun of it.

He had his fans in his grip,
squeezing them with furious
rockers—”Red Shoes,” ”Mystery
Dance,” ”Radio Radio,” "...Peace,
Love, and Understanding”——and
alternately slackening with the
slower ”Almost Blue,” ”Watch

Your Step,” and an unforgettable,
Dylanesque version of ”I Can't
Stand Up For Falling Down.”

It is inspiring to see so much
hoesty in rock ’n’ roll, especially
from a man we found so hard to-
well——trust.

but it doesn't really matter; all
that matters is that I, Ceils is a

needs to be stated, they do so with
sincere vigor and total dedication.

So? So don’t stay away if they
ever decide .to grace Pittsburgh
again with an appearance.
Scream, dance, sing along, work
up a good sweat and get baptized
in the process.

THE CLASH
Stanley

, August 18, 1982

By scorr MERVIS

I seriously think that The Clash
have reached the point where
they've lost track of their purpose.
Or maybe they're just not being
truthful with us. I mean, do they
want to (A) play their blistering
brand of rock ’n roll, (B) become as
popular as Van Halen, or (C)
seduce us with their simplistic
Marxist politics? It even looked as

.though a pensive Joe Strummer,

who clung stiffly to his mike
stand, may have been wondering
the same thing.

Their passionate followers
came to witness the spectacle of
”the world’s hottest touring
band," and they saluted The Clash
by dilligently standing through-
out the entire show. Unfortu-
nately, spectacle is what they got,
along with 22 Clash anthems
played with little feeling and
mediocre musicianship. ’

Strummer’s raspy voice was
thin and tour-weary, their thrash-
ing guitars were muffled, and
Tory Crimes was an inadequate
replacement for Topper Headon.

      

‘ibly rude guy sitting in the sixth

 

    

got from the Pittsburgh audience.
(Uh, huh, embaras-sed again!)

 

Lead Singer Martha Davis has a
smokey slide of a voice that far
surpasses her peers Deborah
Harry or Pat Benatar. She's also a
very patient and good-humoured
woman who put up" a mostly
impassive audience and anvincred-

row who gave her a wave of his
middle finger every few minutes
just to make sure she could see it.
And see it she did, but it didn't
deter her from being a true pro-
fessional; in fact, she even tried a
bit of pleading with him through
song and when that failed, simply
smiled, shrugged, and got on with
the set. Quite a vocalist, but quite
a lady, too.

 

They weren't even in the mood to
dance. Their level of stage energy
fell several fatal beats below that
of the crowd's. They needed to fill
in the holes, rather than the giant
visual backdrops of malnourished
children, erotic commercialism
and military brutality which were
nothing but tedious, rhetorical
distractions.

But, The Clash on a bad night is
still more fun than the mundane
dribble of most rock ’n’ roll events
and certainly worthy of excite-
ment. Several of their more obs-
cure songs (”One More Time,”
”Somebody Got ‘Murdered/’
”Armagideon Time” and ”The
Call Up”) displayed a touch of
emotional brillance, while the
forceful rockers ”Brand New
Cadillac,” ”I Fought The Law,"
”Safe European Home” and
”Career Opportunities” would
have brought the crowd to its feet
if they weren't already there.

But, the standout was the
encore ’’I’m So Bored With The
USA,” and that seemed to be the
attitude they expressed best. I
thought we were a lot of fun.
Cqlme on blokes, it's only rock ’n’
ro .

...little feeling and mediocre muscianship.

Scene from ”Mephisto": When
he hears a dissident fellow actor
has been murdered by govern-
ment agents, Hendrik Hofgen
refuses to believe it, asking, "Are
we in a third—rate malodrama?
Why would the government be so
upset about an actor?”

Unfortunately, the government
in question is the Nazi party, and
as "Mephisto" shows, they

lives of "total purity"—and total
obedience.

Some Germans fervently sup-
ported the Nazis; some protested
against them. "Mephisto," a Ger-
man language subtitled film play-
ing at the Squirrel Hill Theater,
gives us a glimpse of the middle
ground, a purgatory full of Ger-
mans who disagreed with the
Nazis but compromised with
them in an attempt to carry on
thier lives as usual.

The movie's central character is
Hofgen, who is wonderfully over-
played by Klaus Maria Brandauer.
In the beginning, Hofgenis a bit
player in the provinces. At this
point, the Nazi movement is also
in its infancy. Hofgen, however,
flirts with the opposite end of the
political spectrum: Communism.
He helps sets up an experimental
theater ”for the proletariat."

Soon after their fantastic set on

assuming you did more writing
for ”Good Trouble" than for past
REO albums?

Brute: Yes, I wrote two songs for

Heart Of Gold,” both of which we
do in concert.

Hofgen through the years loses
interest in politics and devotes
himself to acting. When Hitler
wins election to the German chan-
cellory, Hofgen’s wife tries to
explain the consequences to Hof-
gen. He declares that acting is the
only thing that matters to him.

Hofgen soon discovers that he
is involved in politics whether he
wants to be or not. Although he is
now a famous and well-respected
actor, his Communist experiences
Tn the past are still remembered by
the Nazis, and Hofgen must leave
Germany for a time.

The Nazis, eager to stem the
flood of talent leaving Germany,
invite Hofgen back. Since emigra-
tion to France or England is pro-
fessional suicide for a German-
speaking actor, Hofgen accepts.

simply an inconvenience.

Hofgen’s ambition soon leads
him to ingratiate himself with the
leading Nazi art fuehrers. He par-
rots their view that the purpose of
art is to propagandize for the
”Master Race.” The Nazis, grate-
ful to have someone with artistic
credentials on their side, use Hof-
gen as a PR man with foreign jour-
nalists. They reward him with the
leadership of the state theater.

When he meets in Paris with his
now-exiled wife, she charges that
the Nazis are using him to make
themselves look respectable. Hof-
gen replies that by working for
them, he is in a position to save
some of the people and the art that
remains in Germany.

Pittsburgh, do you do different

B: Tomorrow we will do the same

old comrades from his Commu-
nist days. Although he is breaking
their laws--the Nazi laws on
racial purity, Hofgen arranges for
his black mistress’ safe passage
out of Germany. In doing all of
these things, Hofgen knows he is
arousing Nazi suspicions. But in
what is basically the only sympa-
thetic element in his portrait, he
refuses to abandon old friends.

At the end of the film, a general
leads a terrified Hofgen on what
might be a whim or the actor's
execution. Hofgen’s last lines of
the film are: "What do these peo-
ple want with me? I'm’only an
actor." But those words are no
longer true. He is now their crea-
tion, subject to their will.

The film's title is taken from
one of Hofgen’s best—known roles,

Hofgen plays the devil who
beguiles a man to sell his soul. The
irony, or course, is that Hofgen is
the one who becomes the devil's
slave.

Besides the Oscar for Best For-
eign Film, "Mephisto" won the
award for the best screenplay at
Cannes, and it's easy to see why.
Despite the film's heavy political
overtomes, the dialogue never
sounded like an essay, but seemed
to arise naturally out of the
situation.

The characters are all complex;
there were no stock characters
such as the Courageous Protester,
the Fervent Nazi or the Crazed
Nazi. Hofgen is not condemned
outright; rather the audience is
led to ask themselves, "What
would I do in that situation?” And
it isn't only the Nazis that ask peo-
ple to compromise their integrity
for their job. Ask someone who
works for the National Inquirer.

"Mephisto" poses some inter-
esting questions, tells a good story
and is well-directed by Isvan
Szabo, who also wrote the screen-
play with Peter Dodai. There are

_even some funny scenes, like

when Hofgen, during a press con-
ference before a new production
of "Hamlet/’ tries to describe the
play as ”full of action" with
Hamlet as the perfect Nazi hero.

IMPERIAL BEDROOM
Elvis Costello
Columbia

With "Imperial Bedroom," Elvis
Costello has made his final depar-
ture from adolescent sexual frus-
tration into the tragic after-world
of its outcome and consequences.
The lonely, separated spouses in
these exquisite songs have all
been through the "mystery
dance," and in the midst of their
marital hardships, they now
wonder with whom their loved
ones are waltzing. What results is
scene after scene of guilt trips,
suspicion and sexual confusion.

Complementing this thor-
oughly developed theme is Elvis’
imperial songwriting, packed with
puns, verbal twists and assorted
profundity. In "Shabby Doll" the
singer realizes that he's older now
and that his sexual encounters
with a "shabby doll" ("she's put-
ting him off and putting you on")
are self-betrayals, turning them
both into ”tired toys.” When it's
over, and he's "lying limp and
soaking," the scene fades out and

the music builds, you can hear the

shreiking cries of his conscience.

In the soulful "Tears Before
Bedtime," the husband has ended
his affair and repented, but
returns to be the victim of his
wife's resentment ("..I don't want
to fight, how wrong can I be
before I am right?") and "the bal-
ance of out love very soon turns to
hate.”

The sad stories of discarded
wedding vows, distracted
drinkers and murdered love
finally lead back to their source in
the "Town Cryer." The singer
watches all the romantic young
charmers who "say they'd die for
love, then they live it out." The
very last line states the proper
conclusion, "I'm just a little boy
lost in a big man's shirt.”

With the help of producer Geoff
Emerick ("Abbey Road") and the
textural Attractions, Elvis has
created his masterpieces. What
could he possibly have left to
prove? But didn't I reach that
some conclusion four albums ago?

; Everything about this album
seems calculated to shock. The
cover features members of the
group wearing expressionless
masks, like that of the relentless
‘Michael Myers in "Halloween,"
but the photo is distorted, colored
‘in ominous reds and pinks. Even
the title, "Pornography," carries
the implication of obscenity, but
without the need to actually be
obscene. J

The fact is, this album "should be
‘obscene and not heard.

The problem is that the elusive
skirting of the grotesque soon
oversteps the boundary into an
overt and ugly torrent of pent-up
frustration, paranoia and
nihilism.

The music begins. A pounding,
rslightly echoing, but simple drum
cadence. A counterpointed bass

"line and ethereal guitar strum-

ming which builds, and builds and
then, "It doesn't matter if we all
die...Sharing the world with
slaughtered 'pigs...Just a piece of
new meat in a clean room..." And
that's only the first song.

The rest of the album never
seems to break out of that pattern,
a dirge—like lead-in to three min-
utes of the apocalypse. There's no
relief from the constant, over-
whelming despair that fills the
harrowed grooves of this disk. So,
you just give up and become bored
with it. It does make you wonder
though, just what mental tor-
ments fill the minds of these boys.

Perhaps the lack of deserved
commercial success has drastically
warped their view of life; The
Cure always has been greatly
under-rated. Whatever the case,
forgive them, and forget this
album.

LETTEROCK
Lisa Hartman
RCA

I remember when Lisa Hartman
used to be on sitcoms; she always
played the bouncy blonde who had
a brain and was sick of being
thought of as dumb. Of courseg
that's rather ironic when you
think of the shows on which she
used to guest—star. In particular, I
recall a few "Love Boat" and "Fan-
tasy IsIand” episodes (they are
interchangeable, right?).

Well I guess Ms. Hartman got
tired of having to compete with
Lauren Tewes’ molars and decided
to get herself an image, which is
displayed all over this, her debut
album. So here's the album:

Front cover: punkish permed
hairdo, blue biker’s jacket and, oh
yeah, there's a skull imprinted on
one of the jacket's snaps.

Back cover: same jacket,
opened, and Ms. Hartman is sort

of, uh, spread on the front of a
truck showing a lot of skin
because she's only wearing a tiny
negligee.

Inside sleeve: another negligee,
sitting inside the truck with her
legs thrown this way and that.

Get the picture? I knew you
would. And the music? Unmen~
tionable, except for the fact that
the songs have the worst lyrics
since Marie Osmond's debut
album. But at least Marie would
never sing a song with lines like
these: "I still want John/But John-
ny's going upstateland while he's
goneII'm gonna make it with his
roommate.” Quick! Somebody call
Webster! The word "bad" has a

new meaning

"Oooooh, love to love ya
baby..." Remember that awful
song? Keeping that in mind, it can
easily be said that Donna Summer
has come light years" with the
release of her latest on Geffen
Records, titled simply "Donna
Summer.”

Just how far she has come might
be judged by the company she's
keeping these days. Along with
having Quincy Jones as her pro-
ducer, Summer has brought along
the likes of James Ingram, Lionel
Ritchie, Bruce Springsteen—well,
you get the idea.

"Diverse" certainly applies
here—a touch of disco, an attempt
at reggae, a hot rocker and even a
bit of lovely torch singing. The
common thread and foundation of
the album is the use of the syn-
thesizer, which despite its recent
new wave rave, has its roots in
this sort of pop/R&B (i.e. Stevie
Wonder.)

"Mystery of Love," a duet with
James Ingram, is a beautiful song
done up nice with string and horn
arrangements. The hot dance
numbers include the single, "Love
is in Control," and its probable
follow-up, "Love is Just a Breath
Away.”

As for the much bally—hooed

Summer-Springsteen collabora-
tion, it’s called ”Protection" and it
sounds a lot like the oft boo-
tlegged "Roulette"——three min-
utes of straight ahead intensity.
Roy Bittan's piano is as haunting
as ever and Bruce_lets loose with
some stinging guitar, the likes of
which has been sorely missing
from his work of late.

Throughout, "Donna Summer”
remains entertaining despite its
many styles, proving again that
Quincy Jones doesn't make bad
records. Like all such annoyances,
disco has left quietly after its bois-
terous entrance onto the music
scene and from its remains artists
such as Donna Summer are mak-
ing great music. Despite rock's
often racist summation of the
genre, it has to be said that both
artist and audience are better for
the experience.

EYE or THE TIGER
Survivor
Scotti Brothers Records

"Eye of the Tiger," the theme
song to "Rocky III'' is riding high
on the charts, but if you think that
is all Survivor is capable of you're
quite wrong. This is the third
album by the quintet. Their last
disc contained the hit "Poor Man's
Son," so they do have a past. With
material on "Eye Of The Tiger" it
is apparent they also have a
future.

Most of the songs on the album
are driving rock that will make the
walls shake. Best cuts are the title
track (of course), ”Feels Like
Love," "Children Of The Night"
and "American Heartbeat." These
songs feature lead guitar by Fran-
kie Sullivan and Jim Peterik,
strong lead vocals by Dave Bickler
and a heavy rhythm line by bassist
Stephan Ellis and drummer Marc
Droubay.

Like a tiger, Survivor is wild and
loaded with raw vicious power.
Some of it has been captured on
"Eye Of The Tiger" but there will
be plenty left for future albums
and concerts.

TOO FAST TO LIVE, TOO
YOUNG TO DIE

Robert Gordon

RCA

Robert Gordon is the master of
rockabilly. Forget the Stray Cats.
Forget Shakin' Stevens. You can
even shove the Blasters into the
corners of your raised conscious-
ness. Robert Gordon puts them all
|to shame with a fiery doo-wop or a
simple crooning of an old Conway
Twitty classic. The man's got
style, class, yeah, even integrity-

I3OBE_RT GORDON
isomething‘ practically unheard of
in rock and roll for the past ten
years.

"Too Fast To Live, Too Young
To Die" is essential for both the
small number of Gordon devotees
and for the new converts. Most of
the cuts here appeared previously
on past Gordon albums, but there
are three new ones included, two
of which are from the pen of Mar-
shall Crenshaw, music's newest
messiah. The other new song is-a
live version of "Black Slacks,"
which appeared in studio version
of Gordon's much under-rated '78
release "Rock Billy Boogie."

Old Gordon material is still
fresher than most of the stuff
around these days, so songs like

"Red Hot," "The Way I Walk,"
”Flyin' Saucers Rock & Roll," and
Springsteen's ”Fire" (pre—Pointer
Sisters—it was written especially
for Gordon back in '77) aren't
wasted by being reissued here.

The next time you turn on the
radio and a Van Halen cover song
comes dripping out, do your brain
3 faV0F and put this on the turn-
table. Someday your chromo-
somes will thank you.

UNDER THE 'BIG BLACK SUN
x
Electra

"Under The Big Black Sun" is
haunted by the recent accidental
death of lead singer Exene Cer-
venka's sister, and the grief is
channeled into the creative
energy of this record. And when I
say energy... '

X play fast, breakneck rock 'n
roll that is compelling, eerie, sad
and sometimes beautiful.

Cervenka and husband John‘

Doe entwine their voices as sen-
suously as any couple I've ever
heard, and have been compared
with Kantner and Slick so often

that I won't mention it. And if
you're looking for a guitar hero,
Billy Zoom can be heard doing jus-
tice to his name.

With all the fire that X plays
with, Doorman Ray Manzarek
(producer) manages to add a
dreamy, ethereal effect that
makes them sound like they've
been up all night doing whatever
these kind of people do. -~

ON THE LINE
Gary U.S. Bonds
EMI America

Gary U.S. Bonds is back—again.
His latest release, titled ”On The
Line," resembles last year's effort,
"Dedication," the album that
retrieved Bonds’ career from the
ranks of the forgotten.

The presence oFBruce Spring-
steen and his Jersey cohorts
stands out as the most evident
similarity. Once again Spring-
steen and Miami Steve Van Zandt
handle nearly all the writing and
production duties. ‘Stylistically,
the similarities contiue as "On
The Line" offers a mix of ballads,
traditional R&B and rockers.

Bonds has certain never been
con__sid_e_red a great vocalist, but he

can churn our good feeling party
tunes—and beer commercials, for
that matter—~with the best of
them. Such is the case in "Bring
Her Back," a mid—tempo, bouncy
tune not unlike "This Little Girl,"
and ”Angelyne," a rock-a-billy
number nicely complemented by
Danny Federici's carnival-like
accordian and some surprisingly
competent vocal help from Miami
Steve.

In a different vein lie two bal-
lads, "Love's On The Line" and
"Last Time,” whose strength
owes more to class musicianship
than to Bon/d's vocals. Joey Stann’s
sax work on the former may well
be mistaken by some to be that of
a certain E Streeter, but make no
mistake. Stann’s effort has a sub-
tlety and mood all of its own.

"Last Time” can be entered as
exhibit A-101 in the case to prove
Miami Steve Van Zandt’s musical
and creative brilliance. How many
more great tunes (ever read the
credits off aJukes album?) does
the man have to write before
someone notices him?

Surprisingly, the single off the
album, "Out Of Work," appears to
have bottomed out. It's an infec-
tious tune and a fresh approach to
musical politicking in that it deliv-
ers a message without any bad
after—taste. ,

Low points include the lengthy
and pretentious "Club Soul City"
and an inane little ditty called
"Turn The Music Down."
Although consistent, "On The
Line," overall, lacks the diverse
feel presented on "Dedication,"
which included material from
some not so shabby songwriters
such as Bob Dylan, Jackson
Browne and LennonlMcCartney.

This is not to suggest that
Springsteen doesn't belong in
such company. On the contrary, I
believe the man possesses authen-
tic genius, but nevertheless, some
of his recent songwriting efforts
(i.e., "From Small Things, Big
Things Come"), would have to be
judged as being weak. Bruce
Springsteen's brilliance is the pro-
duct of an obsession, whereas

great producing remains the pro-

duct of patient interpretation and"
discerning encouragement. Since
I doubt whether the two can be
compatible, I wonder if it wouldn't
be wise for Bonds to make his next
album a truly solo effort?

MARSHALL CRENSHAW
Marshall Crenshaw
Warner Brothers

RECORD RECIPE: 1 boy
1 girl

1 guitar, 3 chords

1 bass

A splash of percussion

NOTE: Add wit and angst to taste
YIELDS: 1 album's worth love
songs

From the songbook of Marshall
Crenshaw comes a batch of blue-
ribbon songs that, when pressed
onto vinyl, chronicle a genre-
American pop——with a deftness
heretofore unattainable by origi-
nal material.

A well mixed rehash of over-
heard hits this is not! Instead,

Crenshaw has provided a beauti-'

fully crafted debut album of his
own words and music seemingly
driven by a vision that is singu-
larly Crenshaw's, yet
American" in every sense of the
word. It's as if he's taken the
appeal of the motherland's revi-
valist twins, Edmunds and Lowe,
and set it in a boy meets girl, apple
pie and lemonade scenario.

Side one's best include "There
She Goes Again,” "Girls," and
"Someday, Someway," the latter
being one of five Crenshaw tunes
recorded by rockabilly rave
Robert Gordon. .

Side two gets even better with
”She Can't Dance" and ”Cynical
Girl," the former being the near-
est we get to a rocker, the latter a
wry love song custom made for
the eighties boasting a Spector-
like production of fuzzy reverbs
and clanging-bell percussion.

"Marshall Crenshaw" uses ele-
ments of the sparse, econo-sound
made good by both the Go-Go's
and The Waitresses, ‘ rarely
stretching the three piece band.
Such simplicity can be attacked by
some as quickly as it is applauded
by others. Is it naive to believe
that things can sound the same as
they did in the good ol' days of
rock 'n roll? Maybe, but thanks to
the likes of Marshall Crenshaw,
they don't have to sound the same
to be just as good!

VACATION
The Go-Go's
I.R.S.

JTIH

"Vacation" proves that the Go-
GO's aren't just one—album-hit
wonders. Much stronger than the
first album, it nonetheless takes
longer to kick into gear, which just
means that you'll have to listen to
it about three times before you go
bonkers, not just once like
”Beauty And The Beat."

When I first heardthe single,
"Vacation," I didn't care much for
it; Belinda Carlisle's voice seemed
too strained, almost as if she were
hitting the wrong notes, and the
arrangement didn't have the
hooks associated with "Our Lips
Are Sealed" or "We Got The
Beat." But, given some careful lis-
tening, it now comes across as
their finest work. The entire
album's like that; it's not as gloss-
ily surfaced as the debut, but with
some time, you'll discover ”Vaca-
tion" is a definite step forward.
Lyrics this time around are
leaps’ and bounds better, and the
same can be said of the music
itself. Sure, there's still enough
singles here to make Olivia blush,

but they're not just simple throw-

’s

THE GO-GO’S

aways; the melodies are more
complicated, even more melo-

dious than we could have guessed

from the first album.

In particular, Charlotte Caffey
(lead guitar) and Jane Wiedlin
(rhythm guitar) take hold of the
musical reins and let go with some
beautiful interworkings. Gina
Schock continues to show that not
only boys_can flog out a steady,
churning beat and Kathy Valen-
tine on bass rounds out the
rhythm section more than
competently. ‘

Belinda seems to represent the
entire group in that she's much
more confident this time around;
witness the controlled fun she has
on nearly..every cut, especially on
"Cool Jerk" (the only unoriginal
tune on the album) and the title
track. The distinct impression is
that everyone's more relaxed
now, perhaps a result of the con-
stant touring the band went
through during the‘ last 12
months. At any rate, ”Vacation" is

one of the best albums you could-
invest in, so don't be left behind-

give yourself a vacation from
musical drudgery and buy this.

Man Of. Thought/Man Of Action; lt’s Not All Books

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Welcome class of '86, and anyone
else who might have their eyes
fixed on these pages. For the green
beginners, are you prepared for
four years of hell? Frightened a lit-
tle, huh? Iwas-too, until everything
fell into place. Sixteen credits shy I
of my diploma, I have finally
found out what it's all about.

In time, you will learn too-
that's why you're here, isn't it?
You'll find that it’s not calculating
quadratic equations, memorizing
details surrounding the Civil War
or understanding the intracacies of

the human body.

No, it's something altogether
different. It's facing the pressure
associated with four finals. It's hav-
ing five hours of studying left three
hours before the test. It's wanting
to go out the night before an exam
and having to make the subsequent
decision——-—go out and settle for a C
or stay in that drabby room and
shoot for the A. A

It's still more. It's having to
accept the professor's opinion that
you are a C student when you know

that you're better. It's absorbing
everything tossed in your direction.
like it or not. It's the real world.

But as you embark on this jour-

 Beware

ney, there is time for a few side-
tracks. I've often chosen Howard
Cosell 'over the historians or psy-
chologists. I've‘always placed the
Steelers ahead of Pavlov and his
gang of dogs. My conditioned
response is to close the books and
turn on Fleming and Cope.

Now admittedly, I'm not an
ideal student.‘ Hitting the books are
not my specialty; watching Julius
Erving hit a 20-footjumper is more
like it. Marconi and Edison are his-
tory; Pitt's chances of a national
championship are the future;

But, the diversions notwith-
standing, I will make it-—just as
you will. First though, as ‘yet"

another threat to my survival, I
have been chosen to head these
sports pages. At least now I have a
reason to sneak over to the Field
House while four chapters await
my tired eyes.

I feel fortunate and honored--
the list of former Pitt News sports
editors is as distinguished as it is
long. Most of the names probably
have more talent than I ever will,
but how many of them can say that
they covered a team judged by
many to be the best in the country?
None of them edited while the bas-
ketball team was playing in the Big
East conference.

Editing is a relatively new expe-

rience for me, just as college is for
you. I've already committed my
share of errors—j ust as most of you
will on that first exam.

Brit don't let the big red X’s
bother you——-you'll learn from
them. The media adviser has prob-
ably used six red pens on my arti-
cles alone. I disagree with many of
those marks, but remember, one
has to absorb everything_. I keep
telling myself that it's part of the
learning process; part of my mind
argues no, the other, yes.

Either way, I'm learning here at
Pitt, and you will too. See you at
the stadium. Or maybe the Field
House.

Many preseason college football
polls have Pitt at the top of the list.
Now all that remains is the task of
winning 11 consecutive regular
season games and a bowl game
against a highly rated opponent.

It's not too far from reality, is it?
Even Playboy magazine—only
slightly more noted for its assort-
ment of garter belts than for its
football rankings——-says Pitt is the
best in the land.

On paper, the figures are con-
vincing. The football-related fig-
ures,-that is. Re-turning from last

22 starters. ,

But before the rings, jackets or
whatever they give national cham-
pions these days are fitted, there is a
small matter of history.

Three years ago, many preseason
pollsters picked the Panthers to
win the championship, but their
hopes were crushed by an early sea-

years ago, a long and frustrating
night against Florida State shot the

A title out of reach. Las't year, it was
that 48-14 disaster to Penn State.

Now comes the irony. The first
two games this season are against
North Carolina and Florida State.

later. Throw in Notre I)ame, and a

Prediction of the future dates

humans have an innate desire to
know what will be before it is.

standings in football seasons. Col-

the use of polls. These take the
form of rankings from one to 20 by

However, these polls are nothing
more than opinions based upon

determination of an official rank-

Basketball Team Ready To Step Into The Big East 

By Scott DELLETT

The wait is almost over; in a
month, the Pitt Panther basketball
team begins practice for what may
prove to be their tnost exciting year
yet as they enter play in the Big East
Conference. The tnain question to
be answered is whether the Pan-
th’ers will enjoy the same success
against teams like Georgetown,
Villavona. St. John's and Syracuse
as they did during the past two
years against Eastern Eight
opponents.

6 However, similar questions have
been asked before. Graduation
took a heavy toll on last year’s Pan-
thers, leaving Dwayne Wallace as
the lone returning starter. Contin-
uing as Eastern Eight champions
seemed highly unlikely.

But head coach Roy Chipman
not only found capable returning
players in Darrell Gissendanner
and Clyde Vaughan but Pitt also
had one of its best recruiting sea-
sons in years. Talent was available,
but experience was not.

The schedule in December
wasn't particularly taxing for a
young team. The Panthers held
tough Alabama-Birmingham in
the first half, only to lose 79-62; the
Blazers’ experience and rebound-
ing making the difference.

The Panthers reeled ‘off a five-

game winning streak. l)ut the victo-
ries were not particularly
impressive. They defeated Division
II school Davis and Elkins by a
scant two points, and even though
Pitt defeated Robert Morris and
Utica (Iollege by a large margin,
their play was inconsistent.

Next on the Panthers‘ schedule
came the Far West Tournament in
Portland, Oregon. Pitt received a
severe setback as Oregon State’s
full—court pressure forced a young
Panther team into submission in a
88-58 rout. ,

For many teams, the loss could
have been devastating, but Chip-
man was able to convince his team
to shrug off the disastrous defeat
and use it as a lesson.

The Panthers did exactly that,
they defeating Iowa State8l -56 and
edging Tennessee 55-54 on an off
balance 25-foot jump by Vaughan
with one second left.

The fifth place finish gave the
Panthers some confidence to carry
them through the season. Again, as
Pitt slid past Temple, Vaughan
was the hero, cooly stepping to the
foul line and converting two shots,
giving Pitt a 60-59 win. The game

also marked a strong performance‘

by Andre Williams, as the 6-8 cen-
ter scored l7 points-—a season
high.

ern Eight opponents. Chipman
made some changes; he inserted
Williams and another freshman
George Allen, into the starting
lineup, while keeping Gissen-
danner on the bench for the open-
ing part of the game.

This wasn't a demotion for Gis-
sendanner: rather, it was a chance
to showcase his talents. Gissen-
danner often sparked the team, as
well as the Field House crowd,
with his quick, sometimes out of
control hands and legs on both
ends of the court. Meanwhile, Wil-
liams and Allen performed like sea-
soned veterans, not scared
freshmen.

The turnaround began against
St. Bonaventure, whom the _Pan-
thers defeated 86-56. Pitt avenged
it.s earlier loss at the Field House to
Rutgers by defeating the Scarlet
Knights at their home court 48-46.

Chipman found the perfect for-
mula for his team—Vaughan with
his long-range shooting and
rebounding against the giants
inside; Williams with his soft
jumper around the key; Allen with
his undisciplined but effective
offensive play; Roosevelt Kirby

Vaughan Ready

To Fill Vacant e
Leadership Role  

By SCOTT DELLETT

Leadership is one quality not
found in many people. But having
a leader is important to the success
of a college basketball team. This
season, Panther forward Clyde
Vaughan will be called upon to fill
the leadership role that has been
held in recent years by Sam Clancy
and Dwayne Wallace.

In fact, as a sophomore,
Vaughan was ready to take over
some duties normally delegated to
seniors.

“I wanted to be a captain as a
sophomore,” Vaughan said.
“Around the middle of last season,
Coach Chipman came up to me
and told me to help out Dwayne
and Giss.”

When Vaughan came to Pitt
from New Rochelle High School,
it was obvious that he was some-
thinggspecial. As a high school
senior, he averaged 34.6 points a
game and grabbed nearly 15
rebounds per contest. These figures
earned him Honorable Mention
All-America and second place to
Sam Perkins of North Carolina for
Player of the Year in New York
State.

His freshman year wasn't any-"

thing special. With a veteran team
returning, Vaughan saw playing
time only as the first or second man

8 off the bench. He averaged" 7.4

points and 4 rebounds per game.
Still, Pitt coaches saw a lot of
potential in Vaughan. Despite his
6-4 frame, he could jump and

Craig and I stood on the
corner of Forbes Avenue and
Bouquet Street. "The buildings
in Pittsburgh look so tall,” I
said.

Craig laughed. “Tall?” he
said. “Maybe in Pittsburgh but
this is Oakland.”

I envied Craig. He seemed to
have learned so much in just
one year of law school. Iguessed
he was at the top of his class.

Craig and I were alumni of
Washington and Jefferson Col-
lege in Washington, Pennsylva-
nia: He had graduated "a year
ahead of me and was giving me
both a scenic and not so scenic
tour of the Pitt campus. Being
from a small undergraduate
college, I was excited by the city
and looking forward to my first
year of law school.

“Do you think you're ready?"
Craig asked.

“For what?” I answered.
“Torts! Contracts! Pierson v.
Post!"

“No!" he said. “Fazio and the
Panthers. Are you ready for
Fa7.io and the Panthers?"

“Well," I said. “I really
haven't given it much
thought."

“Haven't given it much

thought?!" he replied. "This is
Pittsburgh, home of the Pitt
Panthers. What do you mean

you haven't given it much
thought?"

“You said it was Oakland." I
interrupted.

“Don't play games," he said.
“Have you bought your Pitt
shirt yet? Pitt hat? Pitt tie?
Spirit button?”

“No," I said.

“No!” he shouted. “Why?"

“Well," I said, “I guess I've
always been a little partial to
Penn State."

“Shsss," he warned. “You
don't say Pitt and Penn State in
the same breath around here."

"But I only said Penn State."
I replied. ‘

“You don't even say that," he
said.

They Don’t Shoot Penn State

“Bt1t Craig, I'm from
Latrobe, Pennslyvania," I said.
“Joe Paterno's relatives live
there. He buys a paper at the
local newstand once every
summer. And Franco Harris
was a Nittany Lion."

“But Tony Dorsett was a Pitt
Panther," he chided.,.,

“But I like Franco Harris," I
replied. 6

“Then root for the Pitts-
burgh Steelers," he said. “How
about some lunch?"

I was surprised. At least he
thinks about food. I thought.

We stepped off the curb and
into a restaurant on the corner.
He ordered an ‘'0'’ dog and a
bucket of fries. Both the dog and
fries looked a little too chal-
lenging for tne. I ordered a
Coke.

“I think you've got some
things to learn," he began.

“I already know how to write
a brief," I said. "And I've read
Pierson 1:. Post eighteen times.
I'm sure Post owned the fox."

"Would you put law school

out of your mind," he said.
“Pitt football is notjust a week-
end thing. This isn't Washing-
ton and Jefferson. You're not an
undergraduate anymore.”

I was slowly losing my
patience with Craig.

“Let me explain our system,’
he said. ,

I wondered if in some mysti-
cal way Craig had joined the
Panthers.

“Ours’ is no easy task," he
continued

Again with an

. thought.

“We’ve got North Carolina to
contend with," he said “A
rebuilt program at West Virgi-
nia. Those boys from State Col-

“ours," I

lege. And our preseason
rankings in the national
magazines."

“I didn't see your name in
any of those magazines," I said.
“Not my name," he replied.
The Pitt Panthers’ name. Our
natne. Yours and mine. The
Pittsburgh Panthers."

"Excuse tne, the Panthers'," I

said.

“The only way you're going
to make it around here," he
said “is to root for the Pan-
thers. Do you understand?"

“I think so,” I said. “I'have to
root for the Panthers."

“That's a beginning," he
said. -

“Football’s not just a week-
end thing," I replied.

“You're almost there,” he
said.

“And I have to begin every
sentence with Pittsburgh!" I
shouted.

“Almost!" he shouted back.

“Almost?" I asked.

“It's supposed tobe,” he said,
“and never mention Pitt and
Penn State in the same breath."

"And never mention Pitt and
Penn State in the satne breath,"
I echoed.

“You've got it!" he cheered.

‘‘Craig?'' I asked.

“What?" he answered. '-\

“They don't shoot Penn State
fans. do they?" '

Jan Ujevich is looking to gain All-America honors for the fourth consecutive year.

By SCOTT DELLETT

Once, not very long ago,,when
the Pitt Panther men’s swim team
entered the pool area, most corn-
petitors would simply yield the
water to them. After all, the Pan-
thers had won six consecutive East-
ern championships going into last
year./

There was ample reason to
expect a seventh title in arow. Pitt

had sufficent talent returning and‘

had recruited well enough to
replace the outgoing seniors. And
the Panthers had the advantage.of
swimming in the confines of Trees
pool, the site of last year’s Eastern
championship. '

But West Virginia won the title
while the Panthers finished
second. Certainly, it was a shock
when the Mountaineers came up to
Pittsburgh and swept the Eastern,
title out from the grasping paws of
the Panthers. -

Pitt still had the talented
swimmers, but their lack of
divers—-only one performed in the

\

championship, as well as for most
of the dual—meet season—and
problems with overall depth did
them in. in fact, the Panthers
would have defended the
Mountaineers if the two were fac-
ing each other in dual—meet scoring
during the championships.

But head coach Fred Lewis and
his Panther squad are notdwelling
on a season which didn’t equal the
previous five, with a dual—meet
record of 2-3 to go along with the
runner-up position in the East.
Rather, they are thinking of ways
to regain the cherished top spot in
the East. 7

The route will not be as smooth
as it has been without the services-
o_f Rick Cart.er and Breaststroke
specialist__Sandy Pidgeon. Both, in
addition to being outstanding
swimmers, had excellent leader-
ship qualities.

J.D. McCrillis. Jerry Zaleski and

leaders this year. All three have

Last year was unquestionably
the best year ever for the Pitt Lady
Panther swim team. The squad fin-
ished eighth in the AIAW cham-
pionships, their highest finish

»ever. And Amy Jackson became
only the second woman swimmer
and fourth Pitt athlete to achieve
All-America honors four years in a
row. Certainly ample reason for
coach Dr. David Belowich to
celebrate.

However, the celebration is over.
Six seniors, including Jackson,
have left the confines of Trees pool.
To a team that had problems with
depth during the dural meets last
season, this exodus would not
appear to be a good indicator of the
program’s remaining in the top
ten. _

After witnessing the effects of a
couple mediocreyears, Belowich,

former South Florida head coach, H
. has set out to reverse these effects.

Judging from the potential of the

Class of 1986, Pitt will have some.
depth to compete with the top pro-g

grams in the nation in dual-meet
competition.

Most of Belowich’s recruits have
been named High School All-
Americas and should provide
immediate help.

For example, Barb Keller of Lan-
caster, Pa. and Kim Hayes of
Union, New Jersey should help to
improve the distance swimming
events.

“Keller and Hayes have a lot of
potential and should provide
depth to Sue Heon in the middle

and long-distance events,” "Belo-

wich said.

Another recruit that Belowich
speaks highly of is Wendy Morgan
of Oakdale, New York. 

“Wendy has the potential and
background in training to become
an outstanding swimmer,” Belo-
wich said. “She'll provide some
much needed depth. Her future is
unlimited.” _

Belowich also recruited some
speed swimmers with outstanding
credentials: Alicia Dugan (Pitts-
ford, New Jersey), Deni_s_e__Ricketts

Pitt News photo

 

By SCOTT DELLETT

They only participate in two
events, but how important these
events are. The athlethes are divers
and the events the one and three-
meter dives. While the Lady Pan-
ther divers were solid last season,‘
the Panther men’s swim team
stuggled through the season with
only one diver.

Obviously, recruiting was
important since both teams needed
to fill some spots. It was diving
coach Julian Krug’s task to find the
divers. - -

Holly Sluss and Yvone Johnston
provided some steady performan-
ces last year. Sluss has graduated,
but Johnston returns for her
sophomore season. .

“Yvonne competed in the East-
ern finals last year and she should
be a good diver for us,” Krug said.

Krug went to New York State to

"bring in two divers, Triscai Schultz

of Syracuse and Vicki Matthews of
Long Island. Krug said it may be a
while before they become outstand-
ing collegiate divers.

“Both have a lack of experience,
but both of them have a good atti-
tude and in time should be solid

divers,” Krug said. “They’ve got to
spend time learning.’’ ‘

One pleasant, surprise for the
Lady Panther diving team is the
return of Lisa Huey, who will be a
junior this year. She did not dive
last year for academic reasons.

Huey came within one place of
qualifying for Nationals in 1981
and Krug who like to see her regain
that form.

“Lisa is a pretty diver, but she
lacks strength,” Krug said.

“Yvonne and Lisa should be able
to hold us in during the dual—meet
season and l am hoping they score
in Nationals.”

While Krug recruited to stren-
gthen the women's diving squad,
he recruited to rebuild the men’s
squadf At the end of last season,
Rex Nordheimer was the only Pan-
ther diver on the men’s squad.

An outstanding recruiting year
was essential and Krug didn’t have
to leave the state to find the quality
and quantity the Panther teams
needed. -

Mark McCormick and John
Dursch should be able to contrib-
ute immediately. "Both can do a
full list of dives off the three-meter
board," Krug said.

McCormick, of North Allegheny
High School, finished second at
the WPIAL championship and

, sophomore

third at the State meet lastseason,

while Dusch, of Allderdicg, took”

the city league championships.
Both have dived under Krug at the
Pitt Aquatic Club.

"Krug recruited two other fresh-
men, both from the Eastern part of
Pennsylvania. Todd Molzet has the
potential to be asolid diver, accord-
ing to Krug, and Mike McCal1ey
has a background of tough dives,
though Krug said he needs a bit of
work to buff the rough spots.

Krug said the new divers can
help if they show progress
throughout the season.

Nordheimer returns for his
season and Krug
expects improvement from him
also. ~

“Rex has worked on his list of
dives over the summer,” Krug said.

“He really came on last season
despite his lack of experience.”

Krug has set some lofty goals tor
the men’s diving team, but he
believes they can be attained.

“My goal for the team is to get
re-established as the top diving
squad in‘the East. I feel that this is a
legitimate goal.”

Both Panther teams must dive
well in order to stay at the top of
Eastern swimming. But’ as Krug
said of both teams, “I expect to be

strong.”

Gymnasts Preparing For Russians And Upcoming Season

By BRIAN BALK

The Russians are coming!

Yes, according to Frank
D’Amico, head coach of the
Panther gymnastics team, the Rus-
sians will indeed infiltrate the Pitt
campus in the near future.

But these Russians will not he

rallying our citizens to people’s

strike nor will they be seeking clas-
sified information.

They are members of the
National University team, and
their mission will be to deflate
Panther pride. .

“This is the only time this
National University team will be
in the country,“ said D’Amico.
“This is alsoithe first international
meet Pitt has ever held.”

The Soviet squad will face only
six teams in its tour through the

states. D’Amico explained why the *

Panthers were chosen to hold such
a prominent meet, saying, “One
big reason is that we have shown

continual progress in gymnastics -

and in the promotion of the sport.”

The meet, scheduled for
December 6, is one of many on this
year’s schedule. Powerhouses such
as Ohio State and Indiana State
will visit the Pitt Field House this
year.

After last season, D’Amico
promised to revamp the schedule.
It’s not that the team hasn’t been
successful; they established a
record of 16-4 over the past two
years.

The rescheduling reflects
D’Amico’s desire to take Pitt’s
gymnastic team to the top.

“Big names not only attract.

more people, but they make the

whole program a lot better,"
D’Amico said. “When people come
to a close big meet, say, with Indi-
ana State, they are going to really
see intense competition. A meet
like this, where it could come down
to the last man on high bar, will be
extremely exciting, and it will
bring the people back.”

Leading the team in the upcom-
ing season will be junior Dave
Smith, a potential All—America
performer.

“Dave has made tremendous
gains this summer," said D’Amico.
“He is doing a fantastic job in the
all-around, and is learning tricks
on a daily basis.”

Frank Kratz is another Panther
upon whom D’Amico will depend
in the all-around.

“Frank is looking as good as I
have ever seen him,” D’Amico said.

“He has stayed in shape all
summer and is as strong as ever."

Both Kratz and Smith have been
to Nationals and D’Amico hopes
their experience and leadership
will have a positive influence on
the younger team members.

D’Amico hadone of his finest
recruiting years to date, acquiring
two state all-around champions.

The first is New York State All-
Around Champion Mark Klafter.
“He is a very strong and flexible
gymnast who executes tricks very
cleanly,” said D’Amico.

The second is Matt Peters, an.
All-Around Champion from Kiski;
Area High School.

“Matt has much potential, but
may not be in as good shape as the
others because because he hasn’t
had the facilities D’Amico
explained. “Once he comes to Pitt

Another freshman who will see.

immediate action is Kevin Garren.

“Kevin will add a lot of depth to
the team. There is a good chance
that he might emerge as the
number one man on rings or possi-
bly on parallel bars,” said
D’Amico, aware that Garren boasts
a consistent 9.5 handspring front
somersault vault.

Other incoming freshmen with
bright futures are Marty Kaminie
from Peters Township and Jeff
Shablin from Philadelphia.

“The loss of Joe (Femiani) and
Nooch (Capini) on side horse is
really going to hurt us,” stated
D’Amico. Last year’s side horse
squad was one of the best in the
East, but graduation has reduced
the number of Pitt’s side horse spe-
cialists to one, senior Mike Lloyd.

“Mike has been doing a fine job
for us all summer long. He is in
fine shape and is swinging the best
horse I’ve ever seen him swing,”
said D’Amico.

Once again the rules for colle-
giate gymnastics have been altered
by the National Gymnastic Com-
mittee. As the rule now stands,
only nine members per team are
permitted to compete in each meet.

Other meets in which Pitt will
compete include the Ohio State
Buckeye Open——where the best
teams in the country assemble-
and the Baltimore Metropolitan
Open, which the Panthers won last
year. So, gymnastics fanatics and

By BRIAN BALK

After a disappointing season last
year, Lady Panther gymnastics
coach Donna Sanft is determined
to restore the winning tradition to
the program. Her method? Devel-
oping a powerful and diversified
squad.

Sanft’s major task is to construct
such a team. ’

First, there is a need for the
proper building blocks. In this
case, the building materials come
in the form of team members.
judging from the quality of the
squad, Sanft has the material to
build an edifice of gold.’

The strongest link returning is
junior Lisa Shirk. Perhaps the best
gymnast ever at Pitt, her accomp-
lishments include: 1981 runner-up
for the National All-Around Title,
l982 National Uneven Bars Cham-
pion, All-East rankings both years
and a slew of Pitt records.

Working out at camps and clubs
at her home in Danbury, Conn.,
Shirk should return as strong as
ever. There is no doubt that she
will once again be the keystone to
the Lady Panthers’ success.

Gretchen Speich, the Panthers’
version of a robot programmed to
work, work and work, will be back
to finish her senior year. She is
known to be an excellent performer
and a very diligent worker looking
to achieve her goal of consistency.

“That’s the main thing-
consistency,” Speich said. “A lot of
gymnasts become consistent at the
end ofthe year. It would be great if

you“ cogld be consistent. at the-

beginning and hit your routine
every time.”

Babby Flock, a team member
who pulled a medical red shirt last
season, will be back. But this year,
her shirt colors will be the familiar

blue and gold.

“Babby could return and be a
great all-around performer for us,"
Sanft speculated. Flock has been
working out all summer long to
regain the power and finesse that
she displayed during her freshman
and sophomore years.

By far, the most consistent com-
ponent of last year’s squad was
Karen Martin. Expectations are set
on the highest peak for her—she
has achieved All-East‘ status two
consecutive years. Martin's excit-
ing tumbling should add a spark to
the Panther line-up, and with her
experience in almost all kinds of
situations, she could emerge as the
team leader. '

When _junior Sara Strickland
first strolledinto the gym one year
ago, it appeared that she was a long
shot to ever gain a roster spot. But,
patience, hard work and some dedi-

cation have turned her into a
potential superstar.
According to Lady Panther

assistant coach Frank Klein it takes
“about a year for an inexperienced
gymnast to mature to the level of
knowing the basics well enough
for improvement.”

Strickland is close to that level.
Strickland’s improvement over this
summer alone is amazing. She has

, made great strides in her speciali-

ties, the beam and the floor.

most divastating injuries affected a
freshman recruit, Debbie Dab-
kowski. While competing on the
uneven bars in a meet last August,
she suffered torn ligaments and
cartilage damage after a bad angle
landing on his dismount.

After undergoing knee recon-
struction surgery last November,
Dabkowski may be ready to pick up
where she left off last summer.

The untested elements of this

year’s gymnastic super structure.

are the freshmen recruits.
Although none have seen any col-
legiate action, Sanft is already
counting on them to support a

heavy, portion of the framework._

Recruits such as Jackie Caldrone,

from Baldwin, Pa., who placed

fourth in this year’s state competi-
tion, and Kristy Pieters, from Whit-
ing, Ind., who is a stellar performer

‘on the uneven bars as well as the
floor exercise.

Now back to the toiling con-
struction. There is a need for a win-
ning attitude. Gymnastics can be a
mental sport—it requires consider-
able concentration and positive
thinking.

The Panthers don't fall short in
this area. “We have a bunch of
workers on the team. Everyone is

I totally dedicated to success,” Sanft

said.

The final aspect required to cap
the Panthers’ team construction is
some luck. Last year’s team
encountered many incidents of bad
luck: Shirk’s untimely bone spur
operation and the loss to Penn
State by fractions of a point. The
team needs to have the eyes of fate
staring in its direction this year.

The Lady Panther gymnastics

program is on its way to becoming
the success that it once was. If the
solid coaching foundation, the
team members and .the winning
attitude all join forces, Pitt will
once again have a powerhouse of a
ladies’ gymnastic team.

Lady Panther Spikers
Looking To Volley Their
Way To Another Title

By BRIAN BALK

A duplication of last year’s win-
ning season for the Lady Panther
volleyball team will not be easy.
but the defending EAIW Eastern
Champions are prepared mentally
and physically to face the challenge
ahead.

Last year was one of the most
successful years ever for coach Shel-
don Collier and the Lady Panther
Volleyball team that captured the
Eastern crownat the EAIW Eastern
Collegiate Championships. I

The win entitled them to a visit
to the EAIW National Champion-
ship at Florida State, in which they
placed fourth.

“Last season we defeated two top
California teams—-Pepperdine and
Cal. State Berkeley———both are
highly regarded California teams,”
Collier said. “This was the first
time an Eastern team ever l)eat the
really big teams in California.”

Other “big wins” for the Pan-
thers were over Northwestern,
Ohio State, Tennessee and Texas
A&M. However, the Panthers cari-

not live off of last season; it’s time
they prepare for the future. But
there has been one major obstacle
halting their plans.

_ The stumbling block is gradua-
tion. And the question left hang-
ing, according to Collier, is
“Where can we seek replacements
for two of the best spikers in colle-
giate volleyball?" The Panthers
lost two of their most distinguished
players—Paula Olsen and Linda
Statler—-to the graduation eligibil-
ity’ rule. Replacing them will be.
difficult.

“This is the first time in six years
where our game will not be cen-
tered around the spikers,” Collier
said. “We just don't have that good
of spikers  we had in years past;
Paula and Linda made up 70 per-
cent of our offense."

D But Collier is not ready to sur-
render his title. because of the
vacancies. Instead, he has con-
structed a new strategy to help
retain the title.

“This year we are going to rely
on several major contributors to
pick up the slack, as opposed to

putting the heavy burden on the
two spikers,” explained Collier.
“The seniors are going to have to
play big roles—some that they are
not accustomed to.”

One key player who Collier is

depending on is setter Julie Gaul. .

“As of now, I consider Julie the
number one setter in the East,”
Collier said without a trace of
doubt in his voice. Collier’s faith in
Gaul’s ability stems from her
achievements over the summer.

The Lady Panther volleyball team is looking for more spikes of this sort from senior

Tournament and was a starter for
the Eastern squad at the summer

Two of Collier's other major
contributors are seniors Diane Zack

“Both of these girls played major

roles in last year's success," Collier

said. Collier is looking to both of
these athletes to play to their ftillest
potential this year.

Judy Young and Ulaiia Kohu-
tiak are two other returnees who
will be counted on for their
experience.

Collier went the quality route
rather than the quantity one when
he went in search of recruite. He
can boast three noteworthy fresh-
man recruits. _

The first recruit——who Collier
hopes will immediately adapt as a
starter——is Carman Tapial, a 5-11

blocker currently starting on the-

Puerto-Ricaii National team. She
helped lead them to a fourth place
finish at the Latin American
Games.

“She will be a solid addition to
the team,” Collier said.

The second player who Collier
has managed to recruit. comes from
Norwin High School. Sally Gilles-
pie was a starter and captain for her
high school squad which captured
the state title for seven consecutive
years. According to Collier, Gilles-
pie’s best attribute is that she comes
from a school with a winning atti-
tude and a ‘winning tradition.

The third and final recruit. also
originates from Puerto Rico. Re-
gina Reyes was a member of her
couiitry's Junior National Team.
Collier labels her as a player with
good skills in the game.

Not only has the roster and strat-
egy changed from last year, but the
conference has also. The EAIW,
which the Paiithers played in over
the past several years has merged
with the NCAA.

I’ll need a couple ofyears to eval-
uate the NCAA," Collier said of the
switch. “I really like competing
under the EAIW’s format. It was a
real challenge. For me, the jury is
still out.”

The major difference in the for-
mats is that in the NCAA Chain-
pionship, if a team loses once, it is
gone for good. The EAIW held
their championship tournaments
in a “round—robin” style, where an
opening round loser can still have
a chance.
llowever, the NCAA offers more
exposure than the EAIW.

The Lady Spikers have also
joined a new league this year. They
have followed in the footsteps of
basketball coach Roy Chipman

and have acquired membership iii_

the Big East league. “One of our
big goals is to win the conference in
our first year,” Collier said.

The Lady Netters have a sched-
ule similar to the Panther football
team because the toughest teams
are slated at the start of the season.
They face Penn State, Tennessee
and Ohio State all within the
month of September.

‘‘I’m looking forward to the
competition in September,” Col-
lier said. “We will compete against
the best teams, so hopefully, we
will be able to gain some confi-
dence immediately. ,

We’re still going to have to work
real hard because we are hurting in
depth,” explained Collier. “We
also don‘t have the superstars from
the past seasons to carry the team.

“Our best quality is mental
toughness. All the girls have won
at different levels and can play/‘their
best in a.lmost all situations. I think
any goal we set, we can achieve,"
Collier emphasized.

With the new conference, strat-
egy and recruits, the Lady Panther
Volleyball team appears ready fora
new season.

Panthers A Longshot To Win The National Title

continued from page one
Pitt did.

There is a certain degree of luck
involved in winning a champion-
ship, both on the field and in the
scheduling, the second -of which
the Panthers have had as much for-
tune as did the ship on Gilligan's
Island that went for a three-hour
cruise.

Its passengers are still ship-
wrecked on that small island. Pitt’s
shot at the title may be lost just as
quickly, some stiff competition,
rather than a tropical storm, being
the culprit.

There is more. Like Foge Fazio
being untested as a head coach.
Right, coaches don’t tackle the ball
carriers or snag the passes, but they
are responsible for players per-
forming those tasks at peak
efficiency.

Surely there was more than coin-
cidence involved when Johnny
Majors took the Panther football
program from outhouse-to-
penthouse in a short span.‘He was
fortunate to lure players with con-
siderable talents, but he was a whiz
at siphoning every ounce of ability
from them. Jackie Sherrill did the
same, though his teams never won
a championship.

M And now, Fazio will be making

the decisions on fourth—ar1d-one,.

verdicts which are often the decid-
ing factor in a tight game.
Remember, one‘ loss has been good

for second best over the past three
seasqns.

Last year, the loss came against
Penn State. After the Panthers
raced to a 14-0 lead, things went
downhill. Not only did the Lions
score the final 48 points, l)ut a
vicious rush knocked Panther pun-
ter Dave Hepler from the game
with a leg injury.

Which brings up another ques-
tion mark———the punting game.
After off season rehabilitation on
his leg, Hepler is said to be at about
85 percent of his normal capacity.
Fazio was not satisfied with the

punting game at camp in
Edinboro.
No one came forward and

instilled the kind of confidence
that keeps a coach free of ulcers.
Though punters have long been
the victims of jokes and laughs,
punting is important, especially
for a team searching for a
championship. .

Former Florida State punter Ron
Stark proved that two year back,
when his 50-yard punts kept the
Panthers in poor field position
throughout the game.

The loss that night was the only
one that season. It shattered all
hopes of a national championship,
and it proved wrong Playboy and
the other preseason polls that had
the Panthers sketched first on its
lists.

 

 

Panther punter Dave Hepler has still not fully recovered from the knee injury that he

suffered last season.

“Estelle and Janine provide a nice
kind of leadership as non-
scholarship swimmers. They help
out in and out of the water, and
both had their best times ever in
their events last season.”

Sue Heon is another outstanding
swimmer. Belowich calls the jun-
ior individual medley swimmer
“one of the best talents ever at
Pitt.

“Sue is a hard worker who has
done very well on the national and
international level, he said at the
end of last season.

“She had her best times last sea-
son and she has been surpassing
her achievements over the
summer," Belowich said. “She has
the potential to become a national
champion.” —

Heon finished third in the 400-
yard individual medley during the
World Games in July.

Belowich said that he is hopeful
that short distance freestyler and
butterflier Denise Sedlacek will re-
establish her record of strong per-
formances that she had during her
freshman year.

Belowich said that sophomore
backstroke swimmer Laura Barber
has improved since her freshman
year and should be ready to become
a good backstroker. He says of
sophomore distance freestyle
swimmer Barb Kozlina, “she has as
much potential as anyone we
have.”

Despite the number of quality
freshmen Belowich lured to Pitt,
they must perform to their capaci-
ties quickly. The Lady Panthers
face a difficult schedule in 1982-83.

They will meet two-time Eastern
champion Princeton, who finished
tenth in the AIAW meet; Michigan,
who finished fifth in the same
meet; and Tennessee, who earned
tenth place in the NCAA women’s
swimming championships. The
Lady Panthers will also face rival
Penn State, who according to Belo-
wich has lost one swimmer and has
had a good recruiting year.

Belowich is pleased that the
recent political charges surround-
ing the competing NCAA and the
AIAW are over and that all women
swimmers will be competing
against each other-—not the NCAA
against the AIAW.

“Last year was a loss,” Belowich
said. “It was a loss to the athletes
because of the politics. The compe-
tition was diluted in half.”

Belowich is pleased that
women’s collegiate swimming is
now under one roof—the NCAA.

“I am pleased that we are back
together,” Belowich said. “This
means that we have the best compe-
tition in the world at the college
level. It's very exciting.’-’

The Lady Panther swimming
program has entered a new era as

they are now in the Big East confer-
ence where they should be the
favorite to take the first Big East
swimming championship for
women. Belowich believes there
will be stern competition.

“The Big East was originally
developed as a basketball confer-
ence, but they are making commit-
ments to all sports,” Belowich said.
“Syracuse should be the best com-
petition, while Boston College has
some good individuals and Villan-
ova has good team strength.

This, indeed, should be a very
interesting year for the’ Lady

Panther swim ’team. With the
changes in swimming. both at the
national and local levels, along
with the excellent recruiting sea-
son, which wil give the\Pant;her
squad some much needed depth,
Pitt should be among the top
women’s swimming teams in the
nation‘ again this season.

their best year yet during the 1982-
83 season.

An outstanding sophomore class
should be able to provide help for
the Panthers. Ed Bergan, a back-
-stroke specialist who came to Pitt
with times faster than some colle-
giate All-Americas, has the poten-
tial to reach these honors in the
100- and 200-yard backstroke this
season. Ed LaNove, Greg Murphy
and Doug Condon are also very
highly regarded.

Lewis brought in one of the fast-
est high school swimmers in the
nation by signing Doug Martian, a

senior qualifier in the 200-yard.

backstroke whose best time in the
I000-yard freestyle is 10 seconds
faster than anyone currently on the
Pitt squad.

The Pitt Panther swim team can
no longer rest on the champion-
ships of years past. The competi-
tion is starting to catch up and
surpass the once—Eastern swim-
ming kings. This season will be an
important one: the Panthers may
regain the throne, a position they
have not had since 1975. Chances
are that the determination of the
swimmers can overcome any
opposition.

Vaughan To Lead Panthers To Success In Big East

continued from page two

rebound with players five inches
taller. His accurate long—range
jumpers surprised the Pitt Field
House crowd.

Vaughan came back to 'the Pitt
campus ready to play last season.
Over the summer, he lost 20
pounds and proved that he was
ready to play._

He was consistent for the first
part of 1981, but the spotlight
began to shine on him when he hit
a 25-foot shot at the buzzer to give
Pitt a 55-54 win over Tennessee in
the Far West Classic. In the next
game, he converted two free throws
with two seconds remaining to give
the Panthers a 60-59 win over Tem-
ple at the Penn Palestra, a place
where Pitt never seems to win.

There were few forwards that
played as well as Vaughan did dur-
ing the final part of the 1981-82
season. During this span, Vaughan
averaged nearly 21 points a game
while grabbing 12 rebounds. He
scored 25 points in a loss to West
Virginia at Morgantown and he
came up with a 24 rebound perfor-
mance against Rhode Island at
home.

He continued to peak during the
Eastern Eight playoffs, averaging
19 points and 13 rebounds during
the tournament. He scored 21
points and grabbed 10 rebounds in
the Eastern Eight finals against
West Virginia, which earned him
the Most Valuable Player Award of
the tounament. He was also chosen
for the All-Tournament team. /

.With his outstanding play dur-
ing the season and the post-season,
Vaughan was selected to a Big East
All-Star team that toured Europe
this past July.

Vaughan performed well on the
tour. He was the leading scorer,
one game hitting 10 consecutive
shots in one half.

“I think I played and shot bet-
ter," Vaughan said. “I was playing
with good players.” _

Vaughan, who played both
small forward and second guard on
the tour, said he was rather sur-
prised at the way the Europeans
played. V

“They were more physical than I
expected,” Vaughan said. ‘The
Europeans had a couple of great
players on each team.” ~

As for life‘ in Europe, especially
in Yugoslavia, Vaughan wasn’t

surprised by most things, but
nevertheless, there were surprises.
“The pace is much slower than

in the United States,” Vaughan

said. “The food wasn't that good,
but they had good discos, which
surprised me.”

Vaughan added, “It was a great
cultural and basketball experience.

While touring, Vaughan saw
some of the players against whom
he will be competing in the Big
East this winter.

“Seeing the players on the team
gave me a lot of confidence,"
Vaughan said. “I found out that
Pitt players and myself can play in
the Big East.”

Michael Adams of Boston Col-
lege, Dwayne McClain of Villan-
ova and Jeff Allen of St. John were
players on the tour who impressed
Vaughan.

Now, after a couple of weeks rest
back home at Mt. Vernon, NY, a
hotbed of college and professional
basketball talent, Vaughan is pre-
paring himself for his dual role as
player and captain of the Panthers.

“I’m going to help out the young
players both on and off the court,”
Vaughan said. “I'm going to be
more intense in pre-season train-
ing and in practice.”

Vaughan sets goals for himself
and the team, as do most athletes,
but he never reveals them until
after the season.

“Last season, I wanted to play as
well as I could,” Vaughan said. “I
also wanted the team to make the
NCAA tournament.”

There was one goal that he
wasn’t reluctant to reveal. “I'm
going to give 110 percent of myself
in every game,” Vaughan said.

In comparing his basketball tal-
ents to when he first came to Pitt,
Vaughan sees considerable change.

“My ball-handling and defense
is much better now," Vaughan
said, “I also improved my knowl-
edge of the all-around game.

“When I came here as a fresh-
man, my confidence was shaky. I
know it’s going to be there during
my junior and senior years.”

Vaughan realizes that the games
will be more difficult in the Big
East Conference, than they were in
the Eastern 8.

“Every team is going to be com-
petitive,” Vaughan said. “We can't
lie back any night.”

Vaughan is willing to give a pre-
diction of how Pitt will fare during
their first season in the Big East.

“I think we will do well,”
Vaughan said. “I think we’ll finish
fourth in the Big East.”

Where the Panthers finish will
largely depend on the performance
of Vaughan. And judging from
what he has done in the past, the
prediction of fourth is areasonable
one. ‘

The Pitt News, Sunday, August 29, 1982—Sports

,3 Basketball Team Vs. Big East

continued from page two
off the court.

In fact, the Panthers only lost
three of their last 12 regular season
games, including a loss to West
Virginia on.a controversial lane-
violation call, finishing third in
the Eastern Eight standings. How-
ever, in the first round of the East-
ern Eight playoff, Pitt had -to face
Duquesne, who, earlier in the sea-
son, defeated the Panthers at home.
Duquesne plays an emotional
game against the Panthers.

This game was no exception. For
the second time in the 1981-82 sea-
s()n, Williams hit the winning
basket as the Panthers won, 66-64.

The momentum continued into
the semifinals and finals of the
tournament at the Civic Arena. Pitt
took care of iRutgers 60-47 as
Vaughan scored 21
grabbed 13 rebounds. Pitt then
embarrassed West Virginia and
head coach Gale Catlett—— who ear-
lier referred to the Panthers as
mediocre—by taking a large lead
early and coasting to a second cori-
secutive Eastern Eight 79-72.

‘exceeded

points and

Vaughan led Panthers’ scoring
with 21 points while grabbing 10

rebounds en route to becoming the '

tournament's most valuable
player. Wallace added 20 points
and was also named to the All-_
Tournament team, which eased his
disappointment of not being select
to either the first or second team
All-League squad. 1
The Panthers travelled to Pull-
man, Wash. to face Pepperdine in
the first game of the NCAA West-
ern subregional. Putt couldn't cool
off the hot-shooting, high—scoring
waves of the Pacific Coast Confer-
ence. Pitt finished its season with a
99-88 loss. The Panthers finished
with a 20-10 record, which. consid-
ering how young the team. was.
most people’s expect-
ations.
Now, the past is just that, and
preparations for this season have
begun. Again, the team will l)e a
young one. consisting of only one
senior-—Tren«t Johnson—since
Kirby is ineligible because of grade
problems. Vaughan will have to
take over the leadership duties for-

merly held by Wallace, and he will
have -to supply scoring and
rebounding.

The sophomore class will dictate
how successful the squad will be in

the Big East. Williams will be —...

moved into a power forward posi-
tion, one with which he is more
comfortable. Allen will have to
compete against junior Billy Cul-
bertson. who was injured most of
last season, for the point guard
position. 6

Chip Watkins was the first for-
ward off the bench last season and
should compete for a forward posir
tion. Charles Thompson, who
Chipman considers the most
improved player on the team. will
battle for a guard spot.

Chipman again had a good
recruiting year. Perhaps the most
significant recruit will be Keith
Armstrong. who will probably be
inserted into the center spot, a posi-
tion where the Panthers have been
looking to fill for many years. Arm-
strong’s strengths are rebounding
and shot-blocking.

will compete with Thompson for a
forward spot in 1982. David, who is
considered by many the best local
prospect since Sam Clancy, aver-
aged nearly 24 points and 11
rebounds a game last year at Upper
St. Clair. Mitchell averaged 18
points, 12 rebounds and seven
assists at Lexington, (Ky.) Catholic
last year, while shooting 52 percent
from the floor.

The term “team player" fits for-
ward Matt Miklasevich, who aver-
aged 21 points and. 13 rebounds per
game in high school. He should
provide depth at the forward
position.

Wisconsin transfer Herb Lake
should also supply more depth at
the forward spot. Lake, who has
three years of eligibility remaining,
scored 21 points while grabbing 18
rebounds in his senior season at
Youngstown.

Although they are not eligible to
perform in 1982-83, two transfers
should also help the Panthers in
the near future. Jeff Robinson, a
6-9 forward from Broad Ripple
High ‘ School in Indianapolis,
transferred from Cincinnati, where
he played 11 games, averaging
three points and two rebound per
game. In his senior year, Robinson
was named Parade and Street and
Smith All—America, and was
runner-up for the 1981 Mr. Basket-
ball Player in the state of Indiana.

l—Page 11

V Chipman received a lot of criti-
cism when Duquesne Darryl Shep-

pard decided to transfer to Pitt. .

Sheppard said his move was due to
Duquesne's new coach Jim Stalin's
plan of using him at forward,
while he prefers to play guard.

Both Robinson and Sheppard
will have three years of eligibillity
left when they return to action next
September.

Although both last year’s and
this year’s team are young, the
1982-83 edition of Panther basket-
ball will have more questions to
answer. First, and most (impor-

tantly, can Armstrong and Willi--

ams handle centers such as
Georgetown’s Patrick Ewing or

'Villanova’s, John Pinone.

Secondly, can the freshmen per-
form up to the standards that last
year’s freshmen set.

Even if both answers are yes, the
Panthers still will be hard pressed
to repeat their performances of the
past two years. Even though this
year's team is probably as good or
better than the past two, there are
no easy games. Along with their
conference games. Pitt will face
Florida State, Duquesne and West
Virginia. _

In the past, Chipman has said
that the move to the Big Eastvais one
step back to go two steps forward.
The wait is almost over.

 

Christianity isn’t easy. The
concept of not asking and
just believing is far from
scientific, as the world seems
to be. But the idea is
calming...

Canterbury

Canterbury is an Episcopal fellowship of Christian ,
college students. We seek Christ Jesus and we want to _ ‘
be a part of your journey of faith. Canterbury provides
students with a well balanced environment for growth in
the Christian way. Though some who constitute Canter-
bury are from an Episcopalian background, many others
are not. This particular Christian fellowship has the
advantage of being part of a local church with people of
all ages, and is integrated with the rest of the parish life.

Our schedule of the activities for Canterbury includes:
Bible study, worship services, discussion groups, parties
and outings, community services and retreats.

Canterbury meets at the Church of the Ascension,
every Sunday night at 6:30 pm, and is located at the
corner of Ellsworth Avenue and Neville Street. We hope
you will come and share in the journey of our Christian

lives together.

Some More Predictions Involving Top Ten

 

By scorr DELLETT

It’s that time of year again. Every
writer from coast to coast is analyz-
ing, scouting and predicting who
will be this year’s national cham-
pion. People are spending money
on magazines not only to see the
experts’ predictions but also on
how to supplement thei-r salaries.

Anyway, this writer decided that
if the rest of the world is able to see
into the near future, he is too. Now,
without further delay, here are the
Top 10—from number 10 to
number one—so don’t peak ahead.

10. Clemson: It’s time for the
inhabitants of Tiger country to
defend their title. The problem for
‘head coach Danny Ford is replac-
ing the 11 starters he lost at
graduation.

The biggest losses came on the
offensive line; only junior James
Farr returns. Brian Butcher, Gary
Massaro, Bob Mayberry and Alex
Hudson are the replacement
candidates.

Quarterback Homer Jordan

returns for his senior season. The 1

Most Valuable Player in the
Orange Bowl, Jordan hit 54 per-
cent of his passes for over 1,600
yards last year. The starting back-

field of Cliff Austin and .,Jeff

McCall returns intact.

The number two defense in the
nation returns six starters; the top
players are tackle Dan Benish, nose
guards William Perry and William
Devine, end Andy Headen and
safety Terry Kinard. '

The kicking game, with punter
Dale Hatcher and kickers Donald
Igwebuike and Bob Paulling, is
solid.

The schedule again seems favor-
able for the Tigers; Georgia and
North Carolina are the only serious
challengers.

9. Southern California: The Tro-
jans are serving probation until
1984, having been caught in the act
once too often. The Trojans must
also replace Heisman Trophy
winner Marcus Allen in the back-
field. Junior Michael Harper is the
leading candidate to carry on the
respected tailback tradition.

Sophomore Sean Salisbury took
over for last year’s starter John
Masur, who headed off to Texas A
8c M. Todd Spencer will be the full-
back, unless Harper doesn’t pan

out at tailback.

The Trojans may not have to
worry about the tailback position
with the massive offensive line
returning, led by All-America can-
didates Bruce Matthews and Don
Mosebar.

Seven starters from the defensive
return, including George Achican,
a possible All-America.

Both kickers return for USC.
Steve Jordan converted all of his
extra poi_nts, while Dave Pryor
Averaged 42 yards a punt.

The schedule is demanding; the
Trojans face rivals UCLA, Notre
Dame and Oklahoma.

8. Georgia: Until the franchise
Herschel Walker broke his thumb,
the red-neck Bulldog fans were
anxious to see another national
championship come into Athens.
Biut Walker—who many of the
Georgia fans called Superman-
proved to be mortal when he broke
the thumb on his right hand.
Forget Georgia, right? Not quite.
Okay, the Bulldogs need to find a
quarterback. But the offensive line
returns four starters, including
Jimmy Harper and Wayne Rad-
loff. Tight ends Norris Brown and
Clarence Kay also return.

Thurson are among the eight star-
ters returning on defense.

Kicker Kevin Butler and punter
Jim Broadway also return. Florida
and Clemson should be the tough
games for the Bulldogs, and even
without Walker for the early
games, Georgia will survive.

7. Southern Methodist: Bobby
Collins comes in from Southern
Mississippi and takes over a team
with two outstanding tailbacks—
Eric Dickerson and Craig James.
Dickerson gained 1,428 yards while
James added 1,147 last season.

Lance Mcllhenny returns as
quarterback and Scott Gibson and
Joe Beard head the offensive line.

Leading the defense is linebacker
Gary Moten and back Russell Car-
ter. Going through the tough
Southwestern Conference unde-
feated will be a difficult task for the
Mustangs.

6. Washington: Two top maga-
zines have picked the Huskies as
number one, because of their talent
and relatively easy schedule.

Only five starters are missing
from the 1981 team. Quarterback
Steve Pelluer returns, along with
Jacque Robinson, the running
back who surprised everyone by
rushing for 142 yards on his way to

the Most Valuable Player award in
the Rose Bowl. ‘

Anthony Allen and Aaron Willi-
ams are the wide receivers; tackles
Eric Moran and Don Dow lead
Robinson to daylight. Mark Ste-
ward, inside linebacker Ken rDris-
coll and Ray Horton take care of
the defensive chores.

The kicking game includes one
of the best placekickers in the
nation, senior Chuck Nelson.

The schedule plays in favor of .

the Huskies, who only leave their
homefield twice before November.

5. Penn State: Like every other
year, Joe Paterno mourns the loss
of his seniors. And like every other
year, Penn State will turn in a good
season.

On offense, quarterback Todd
Blackledge, tailback Curt Warner,

' wide receivers Kenny Jackson and

Gregg Garrity and offensive line-
men Bill Contz and Pete Speros
return. The defense has Walker Lee
Ashley, Roger Jackson and Mark
Robinson.

Ralph Giacomarro will con-
tinue to bang out long and high
punts at Beaver Stadium.

Things will still be joyful at
Happy Valley, despite playing
Nebraska, Alabama, Notre Dame

J and Pitt.

Forget The Schedule, Panthers Can Win The Championship

co'ntinued from page one
year's Rose Bowl MVP, running
back Jacque Robinson) returning
on offense. The teams Washington
will play are not of the caliber they
have been in the past—excluding
USC, that is.‘Washington can also
boast several quality performers-
defensive back Ray Horton and
place kicker Chuck Nelson, who
compiled 77 poims last year.

College Football does not ‘place
the Panthers at the top. Instead,
they rely on the expertise of Danny
Sheridan, one of the nation’s pre-
mier football analysts, who boasts
a 68 percent accuracy rate, to draw
up their poll. Sheridan ventured
into the Deep South to choose the
Crimson, Tide for the No. 1
position.

Although this was the only poll
to assign Alabama the No. 1 slot,
the Tide is very much in conten-
tion. Bear Bryant's corps consists of
54 returning lettermen, 17 of whom
started every game last year. Ala-
bama also has one of the finest
secondaries in the country, with
cornerback Jeremiah Castille and
All-America safety Tommy Wil-
cox. Once ‘again, the rolling Tide

‘cannot be overlooked.

Now, there are some magazines
that ignore common logic and
appeal directly to the consumer's
appetite. One magazine with the
“give the reader what he wants to
hear” stance is Football Forecast.
Its resident expert, Mike Warren,
has chosen Penn State to occupy
the No. 1 position. Warren says
that the Lions’ explosive offense
and topnotch coaching will make
them unbeatable.

Paterno, Todd Blackledge and
Curt Warner are impressive—but
No. 1?

Football Illustrated nominated
the Washington Huskies as the
pick for No. 1. and the Nebraska
Corn Huskers as No. 2. The Corn
Huskers, though, have drawn a
blank in the quarterback position.
Last year’s duties were handled by
Turner Gill, who performed well.

Gill’s season, however, came to
an abrubt halt when he suffered
nerve damage in his lower right
leg. If Gill can regain the effective-
ness that he had last year, Nebraska
will be in the running.

Preseason prediction is only a
writers opinion, thus I deserve a
crack at it. Here are my top five
picks for the _ upcoming 1982
season:

1. Pittburgh: With senior quar-

terback Dan Marino at the helm,

quality receivers Dwight Collins
and Julius Dawkins and the safe-
guarding of the most effective
offensive line in the country, the
Panthers’ ability will win them the
top spot.

2. Alabama: Bear Bryant, a mas-
ter at collegiate coaching, has con-
trived a team built on experience
and speed. Once again they will
dominate the South—perhaps the
entire country. ’

3. Washington: The odds play in
the Huskies’ favor this year. With
USC on probation and veterans at
almost every position, the Huskies
might put on a repeat performance
of last year’s Pac-10 title.

Despite a difficult schedule, All-America quarterback Dan Marino can carry the
Panthers to an undefeated season.

4. North Carolina: A successful
recuperation of Kelwin Bryant’s
knee could amount to a winning
harvest for the Tar Heels.

5. Southern Methodist: The dual
team of Eric Dickerson and Craig

James at running back are not only
breaking records at SMU, but also
creating a two-fold offense that
will be difficult to squelch.

Although the AP, UPI, Sports
Illustrated and N.Y. Times polls

Roth photo

are not out yet, word has it that they
will choose the Panthers as a top
contender. -
The crystal ball is still cloudy;
however, a figure of a Panther sit-
ting on top of a stack of 20 can be
seen by many.. ’
