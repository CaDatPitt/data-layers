Petition Calls

For Lower

Voting Age

.'s'¢u' mIi'IuriuI. ])(l_Lf(' 4

A petition calling for the Penn-
sylvania legislature to lower the
voting age to 18 will be circulated
throughout the University campus
this week.

The petition states: “We the un-
dersigned agree that the voting
age requirement in all federal.
state. and local elections should
be lowered to 18. We heartily en-
dorse every effort made on be-
half of the civil privileges of the
18-year-old.“

The petition was drawn up by
SG Senator Ed Levine and IFC
representative Nate Stark.

They hope to have at least 5,000
signatures on the petition before
th e Pennsylvania legislature
meets in November. The petition
will then be presented to Con-
gressman Albert Pechan who sup-
ports the 18-year-old vote.

The State Legislature must ap-
prove this proposal twice. once in
November session and once again
in the January session. If so ap-
proved. the bill will be presented

" to the public as a referendum in

May.

Four other states have already
lowered their voting age require-
ments. The legal voting age in
Kentucky and Georgia is 18. The
two newest states. Alaska and Ha-
waii. have minimum req u i re -
ments of 19 and 20. respectively.

Undergraduate Council Develops A

Program Of Self-Designed Major

Students in the College of Arts and
Sciences can now design their own

majors, if they can fulfill the require-_
ments set up for a Self-Designed Ma-

jor by the Undergraduate Council.

The Self-Designed Major program

will be available to qualified students

beginning with the coming Winter

Term. The programs requirements

are as follows:

1. The students must have junior stat-'
us, with a minimum of 58 credits,
by ,the end-of the current term. A
second-term junior, with a maxi-
mum 75 credits, could also be ac-
cepted.

2. The student must be in good aca-
demic standing at the time of his
application.

3. The student will coordinate his
program with a faculty advisor,
who can be any regular member of
the College faculty. The student
must write a justification of his pro-
posed self-designed major. The fac-
ulty advisor must then endorse this
justification and forward it to a

Legal Committee

committee, which is soon to be
named by the Undergraduate Coun-
cil. The advisor will direct the stu-
dent’s program and register him
each term.

4. The student-’s major program must
involve work in at least three de-
partments, with a minimum of 36
credits. The student’s senior year
must include an integrative inde-
pendent study project directed ‘by
the faculty advisor.

The major must also be sufficiently
different from existing_majors. Since
the committee to approve Self—Design—

_ed Majors has not yet been named,

students may submit their proposals
for such majors to the dean of the col-
lege.

Institutionalized interdepartment-
al majors are now in the planning
stage. including majors in “Urban
Civilization“ and “Communications.”
The Undergraduate Council. which
approved the Self-Designed Major
program. consists of representatives
from departments of the College and
from the student Liberal Arts Cabinet.

Chairman Requests Fair Representation

by PEGGY ALLEN

“The basic problem facing
the Legal Awarneness Com-
mittee (LAC) is that there is

" - no clear-cut statement of Uni-

versity policy. Nowhere does
it say what the offenses are
and what the specific punishment
for each offense is." said Scott
Baum. newly appointed chairman
of LAC. “We -on the committee»
are going to request from the ad-
ministration. a detailed statement
of policy."

"Judicial Organizations." ex-
plained Baum. "are the second
problem facing LAC. There is no

, separate board to deal with com-'

m u t e r s. ' ‘ he said. "Although
Men's D o rm Cou'i.cil_ - Judicial

Board IMDCJ represents dorm
students. commuters. and frater-
nity men. the charter states that
members of Judicial Board must
have resided in the dorms for at
least two terms. This is not a fair
representation."

Baum added that .\/[DC is re-
quired to have an advisor who has
the right to comment on or to dis-
approve of all penalties passed by
MDC. This advisor. who is ap-
pointed by the director of hous-
ing. must also be consulted be-
fore a justice can be dismissed.

Students applying for member-
ship in MDC must be interview-
ed by the director of housing, the
current president of MDC, a mem-
ber of the Counselor Staff, the

chairman of the current Jjidicial

Board, and the Judicial Board
advisor. Of these five people, only
twoare students.

“What we saw as the major
problem is the overpowering in-
fluence of the administration,”
said Baum. “At Penn State. where
the idea for the LAC originated.
they found that the presence of
administrators intimidates s t u —
dents."

Baum also spoke out against
rules governing dismissal from the
University. According to the Stu-
dent Handbook. a student can be
dismissed solely by the action of
the dean of men or "the dean of
women. If the student shows “ade-
quate progress." he can be re-in-
stated. However. since there no
longer is a dean of men and a

dean of women. the rules book is
obviously outdated. "And." asked
Baum, “What exactly is ‘adequate
progress?” '

“The function of LAC will be

to provide students with a state-
ment of their legal rights and to
provide for legal assistance if any
students need it,” explained
Baum. “Eventually, we.will re-
structure or change the judicial
system of the University to make
it more equitable, less paternalis-
tic, and just. The student must
have the inalienable right to be
judged by his peers.”

"But." he added. "we do not
want to ban the administration.
We just want to put them in their
proper place — as an administra-
tion."

The most effective form of student power could be the

X power of the ballot. If the voting age were 18. the student

8 would have a significant tool—-the vote—with which he could
shape his own destiny.

Are 18 year olds qualified to vote? If given the chance
will students accept the responsibilities of this privilege-
the responsibilities of being informed. and of going to the
polls on election days?

This week the students of the University will have the

opportunity to partially answer these two questions. A peti-

tion calling for an 18-year-old minimum voting age will be
circulated throughout the campus. The response to this peti-
tion could be a crucial factor in influencing Pennyslvania

I " legislators to write into law a lower state voting age require-

ment.

A response of as least five thousand signatures would in-
dicate that students want vote power. If students show that
they want this power and that they are willing to work hard to
get it, the Pennsylvania legislature would be more apt to sup-
— port such an idea.

Many prominent persons including Lyndon Johnson. Sen-
ators Everett Dirksen. Mike Mansfield. Wayne Morse. Jacob

. Javits, and Birch Bayh have voiced opinions in favor of 18-

.year-old voters. Now it is time for 18 year olds to show that
they want the vote.

The qualifications of an 18-year-old voter have been
widely discussed. Some people feel that the present genera-
tion of students is well-informed enough to vote. Others feel
that they are not mature enough to vote until the age of 21.

President Johnson feels that “the young people of Amer-
ica in this decade. are far more ready. far better qualified. far
more able to discharge the highest duty of citizenship than
any generation of the past."

Dr. Edward Shoben, director of academic affiars of the
American Council of Education. concurs. "Today‘s 18 year
olds are well-informed . . . In fact. the scores that young peo-
ple make on achievement tests show that they know more
about the world than their parents did at the same age.“

Student involvement today is far greater than in any gen-
eration of the past. The vast majority of American_ students
have shown a willingness to work within the system. It was
these -students who made Eugene McCarthy a Presidential
contender. It is these students who despite the fact that they
lack vote power, are working for local political candidates
throughout the country.

It is students who have made the country take a good.
hard look at its foreign policy. It was student protest that caus-
ed our government to re-examine and re-structure our involve-
ment in Vietnam.

Lowering the voting ageto 18 is not a radical idea. Geor-
_gia and Kentucky have previously given vote power to their
18 year old citizens. The nations of Israel. Brazil. and Uru-
guay have an 18 year voting minimum. Alaska and Hawaii
also have lower voting age requirements. 19 and 20. respec-
tively.

Lowering the voting age to 18 is by no means a new idea.
either. In 1867. Marcus Bickford. New York legislator. pro-
posed the lowered age requirement because “men are mature
‘both in body and mind at a great deal earlier period than for-
fnerly.”

In'1776, the colonists of this country fought a war be-

Today, two million Americans, Americans who are under the
age of 21——pay taxes. Is this not taxation without representa-
tion? ’

Today, thousands of American youths fight a bloody. vio-
lent, insane war in a strange country far from home. Many of

these men are opposed to this war. but are unable to make
their oplnions count.

Eighteen year olds should have vote power. But. they will
probably not recieve this power if they do not work for it.

Friend’s?l1emCloud:7 Mirrors

Of Our Own Life’s Existence

“Of course. she's my friend. After all. how many
other people would lend me a completely new out-
fit. finance the entire evening and then cover up
when m_y parents called to check up on me after I
had promised them that I would stay in that night
and study 1"‘

To some people. this is one definition of friend-
ship. But how many more definitions can we add to
this loose onei’ Probably. a multitude of definition_s
ranging from acquaintance to love. It is clear that
there is no one universal definition.

To reach a better understanding of the concept
of friendship. a closer look is necessary. It is impor-
tant to obtain this understanding because by com-

prehending our friends. we can learn about our-.

selves.

CERTAINLY, WHEN the going gets rough.
which is almost an everyday occurrence at school.
we turn to someone that we think may alleviate our
troubles. In this case. is it a real friend that can suc-
cessfully distort the situation with a lot of sweet
words and perhaps white lies‘? Or does a real friend
make things better just by being there‘?

happily on the firm ties made with other students"
Can we honestly admit to ourselves that we are go-
ing to “keep in touch" with those same persons that
at one time we spent staying up all night together
philosophizing with. or spent hours laughing over
something as absurd as nothing‘?

TRUE, IT IS very likely when it comes to scrut-
inizing ourselves and our friends land the time
should come! .» we face more than a formidable
task. The first and hardest step is to make the de-
cision not to deviate from the facts. An even harder
task is to look hard at the people that we have ac-
cepted into our minds as "true-blue" and think that
a mistake has been made. Hopefully we can look
into the nature of our relationships with others and
know that our kind thoughts stem from a true sense
of feeling rather than from the fact that this person

did us a favor “once."

For most of us. the appraisal of our comrades is
a long and hard pI‘0C€SS.For some. it isa process
that will never be attempted at any time. The ob-
ject of this introspection and thought is relative:
the effect of such a process will vary considerably
among individuals.

Hopefully as the realization of what constitutes
a friend becomes more tangible to our minds. the
nature of our own souls will become m ‘e a a t

Editor. The Pitt News;

I regret that you encountered
difficulty in obtaining medical
care at the Student Health Ser-
vice on Sunday “ afternoon. Oc-
tober 6. I always appreciate hear-
ing from students about problems
relating to their medical care‘here
and would be pleased to talk
with you personally about this.

As I sense your particular pro-
blem. and I know only what you
wrote in your letter to the Editor.
it relates to a communication
failure. Since it might be helpful
to other students to have more
understanding of the arrange-
ments here.

As noted in the booklet. "Stu-
dent Health Service and Insur-
_ance Plan." there are notices on
campus bulletin boards indica-
ting the time of Saturday. Sun-
day and Holiday Doctors Hours
12:00 to 2:45p.m.l and the times
for telephoning the Student
Health Service to speak with a

physician «Monday-Thursday
10-11 a.m.. Friday 2-3 p.m.. and
daily 8:30-9:30 pm.)

If those visit or telephone
times are not suitable on a Scat-
urday, Sunday. or Holiday. you
should go to the Student Health
Service. Arrangements for this
are described further in the book-
let. We do not receive telephone
calls at other times. but if you
telephone the switchboard oper-
ator. she should tell you to go to
the - Student Health Service
or what to do if the physician on
duty is momentarily away from
the Student Health Service.

I do_ not understand the dial-
ogue between you and the tele-
phone operators as you report it.
The Chief Operator believes
you were given appropriate in-
structions and indeed several stu-
dents were seen on that Sunday
afternoon by the physician.

I hope that this information
will be helpful to you and others
when you need medical cure in
the future.

‘Infantile’ Vulgarity Here?

Editor. The Pitt News:

Everytime I have read the Pitt
News this Fall Term I have said
to myself: "Surely they are not
. them that young!"
As I read its lines I think ofa lit-
tle boy who likes to shock proper
‘P9-0P19 b.V Saying naughty words
in their presence. or who sur-
reptiously inscribes forbidden
symbols on public walls.

Such infantile vulgarity is not
the language of a passionate
pleader of a cause. not the lan-
guage of an intellectual presen-
ting a reasoned argument to per-
suade. not the language of a skill-
ed satirist. It is nothing more

than the language‘ of an immature
youth trying to prove to himself
that he is a man by defying the

Criticized
Editor. The Pitt News:

In reading Dr. David Houston's
proposal -to disarm campus police
for an experimental one-year per-
iod and the editorial endorse-
ment of" it «The Pitt News, 9 Oc-
toberl. I was struck by the lack
of rigor in the arguments present-
ed in advocating such a move.

True enough. we in the Univer-
sity community presumably do
not need protection from each
other by use of postols or chemical
Mace since. supposedly. we are
pursuing our academic interests.
It might be rightfully assumed

‘that. in such a situation. if isola-

ted from the rest of the hurly-
burly of life. as for example in
small college town throughout

the country. armed campus police

probably would not be necessary.

But in our situation here as in
other “asphalt" campuses. such
as Columbia. Temple‘ and the
University of Chicago and the
many.others which lie athwart
main thoroughfares and are lo-
cated in areas densely populat-
ed by persons having no connect-
ion with the University. we are
face to face with the rest of the
world.

It would be naive to assume
that the need for protection of
University life and property in
such circumstances does not exist.
It may well_be that -the munici-
pal police. when they arrived.
could adequately cope with any
adverse occurrence but having
armed campus police who are
more intimately familiar with the
campus terrain immediately
available seems to me a much
more secure. desirable and emin-
ently sensible arrangement.

Security. _no matter how it is
achieved or enforced in this
world is not something to be ex-
perimented with or taken for
granted. The need for protective
precautions will never disappear.
In my opinion. unless and until
everyone agrees to and rigorously
abides by one standard of con-
duct in which antisocial, acts of
any description are proscribed.

Harriers Win

West Virginia’s Carl Hatfield held the lead last Saturday
against Jerry Richey and his teammates for most of the race. but
sophomore sensation came on to lead the harriers to a 23-32 win.

"Hatﬁeld gave Richey a tough race. Jerry didn‘t win until the
very end.“ remarked coach Jim Banner. According to Banner. Hatfield
is a good runner. one of the three best runners that his squad has faced
this season. He compared Hatfield to .\'otre Dames Watson and Kent

State's Norris. "Richey was a lit-
tle surprised that Hatfield was
that tough." said Banner.

Hatfield displayed a strong de-
termination to win. Banner indi-
cated that the West Virginians
were looking for their star harrier
to pull an upset. At least it ap-
peared as though most of the
Mountaineer fans believed that
Hatfield could beat Richey.

“That’s one reason,” Banner ex-
plained, “that Hatfield ran such
a great race. I wouldn’t have been
surprised if Hatfield had won. I
would have been mad.”

However. Banner never really
doubted Richey‘s victory. He rea-
soned. “Richey‘s a strong runner.
and I thought he'd win. But. Iwas
shook up- a little after watching
Richey trail for the first five
mile s. Jerry wa s determined.
though.“ Banner added that he
thinks Jerry Richey can continue
undefeated for the remainder of
the regular season and throughout
the IC4A's.

by ROY JACOBS, Sports Editor
ANNAPOLIS. MD. — A feeling of hopelessness seems to be ever increas-
ing on the Panther football squad. Nobody knows what it is like to win any-
more. and as a result. nobody knows howto win either.

Victory number two of the 1968 season was coming easily here Saturday.
despite a downpour. but the Jungle Cats managed to lose. 17-16. to previously
winless Navy. After losing a 16-6 lead. the Panthers still had life until the last
27 seconds when Joe Spicko missed a field
goal from the 12-yard line. ‘

There were at least half a dozen other
turning points. although it ultimately came
back to Spicko. The Panthers had Navy on
the run in the third period. Why couldn't they
put the game away then?

Instead, after dominating the third quar-
ter, the Panthers turned conservative and were
stopped twice on downs at the beginning of
the fourth period. The second time a bad cen--
ter snap on the punt attempt led to a safety.
The Middies also pushed across a touchdown
and a field goal the two times they had the
ball in the final period to take a 17-16 lead.
Why does this always happen to Pitt? These
players were winners in high school. Why
not here‘?

“They subconsciously get tight at the end
of the game,” said coach Dave Hart. “They’re

so‘ fearful of it happening that they let it hap-

down the field. We made two fourth-down plays that had to be. All we had to
do was put the ball through to win. 2. ’

“They had to make a 36-yarder,” he added, “and all we had to do was
kick the ball like an extra’ point. Instead of following through, he_ (Spicko)
poked at the ball.”

, One of the Panthers that Hart has always maintained was a winner is
wingback Joe McCain. McCain had had his shoulder practically torn apart at
Syracuse last week but had recovered enough to make the trip. He did not play
until the final two minutes of the game. But in that brief span, Joe made two
clutch catches—both on fourth down plays. '

“Joe’s a winner,” said Hart. “He made two great, class plays. I guess
I’ll have some second thoughts on not using him to kick the field goal, but
even he said I had to go with Spicko.” ' ' .

Perhaps McCain could have kicked the field goal. But then, there might

pre-ordained to lose no matter what. There were other turning points, too: '

return punts on Friday. He fumbled because he ran into his interference. ‘

—On the fourth and two situation ‘in the last period during Navy’s touchdown-
drive, quarterback Mike Mc\'allen completed a 10-yard pass to halfback,‘
Tom Daley. They play worked all afternoon because the linebackers—wie_tli'i_
people like Ed Gallin, Lloyd Weston, Ralph Cindrich, and Ken Shumaker’
unavailable—were too run conscious. “The linebackers weren’t doing their,’
job,” blasted Hart, This key fourth down pass turned the game around. I

—The safety resulted when Dave Magyar’s snap went sailing over punter
Spicko’s head. The ball was probably slip— 
pery from the rain. Spicko kept his head and
made the right play by running out of the
back of the end zone.

—During the drive for Navy’s winning field
goal, on a third-and-one short-yardage sit-
uation, McNallen tried to cross the Pan-
thers up and pass long. Defensive back
Charley Hall read the call and had flanker
Karl Schwelm tightly covered. A near in-
terception resulted. Hall said, “I thought
I had it. I should have had it. The ball was
wet, though.” ‘The play he made was a
great one, but, oh, if he’d gotten that inter-
ception. » '

-—With a second down on the three and 29 sec-
onds remaining in the game, Panther quar-
terback Dave Havern faked a pass to Skip
Orszulak, then threw out of bounds to stop
the clock. Orszulak was open in the end
zone.

Any of these plays, conceivably, could
have turned the game around. So could have
missed extra points and other missed field
goals by either team. But the fact is, they
didn’t.

And instead of coming home with their A e .
second win of the season, the Panthers are only more deeply entrenched in the!"
mire of losing. Instead of shattering the overriding feeling of hopelessnessﬁ
the missed field goal only reinforced it. ‘

ers came before that first minute
had elapsed in both the first and
second quarters. John Thompson
headed a shot off a corner kick _at
55 seconds of the opening period
and Sezgin Ozdin checked in with
a goal at only 27 seconds of the
second stanza.

The third score came on a com-
bination of the talents of these two
Bobcat’ linemen. Ozden assisted at
17:20 of the second quarter. as
Thompson knocked in his second
goal.

So, it was another shut-out suf-
fered by the kickers, their fourth
of the season. But, Coach Leo
Bemis was not too disappointed
with his five-man line that was
supposed to generate some scor-
ing. _

“I think we had a lot more of-
fensive pressure by playing the

“We played enough to b e a t

Ho. was right, too. The chances
were there. The booters out-shot
coach Phil Roach’s Bobcats, 11 to
8, and this advantage could have
been greater. The soccermen were
constantly pressuring the Ohio
defense, but, far too often, impor-
tant shots weren’t taken.

The kickers would either try for
better control or attempt to pass
off to someone else. and the ball
would be cleared away by an
alert Bobcat defense. '

Bemis decided. “I guess we'll
just have to work on shooting
more."

He also felt t h a t the muddy
field aided the Ohio attack. “They
were a good first-time ball club,
and under these kind of conditions
that shakes you up,” he comment-
ed.

The coach was pleased with
the effort of his club. though.
