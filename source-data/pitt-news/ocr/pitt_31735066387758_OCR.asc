Pitt official considered for presidency of Florida college

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

The secretary of the Board of Trustees of
the University of Pittsburgh is one of 12
candidates remaining from the original
180 vying for the presidency of a Florida
university.

Dr. John Quatroche was informed two
weeks ago that he is a nominee for the top
position at Florida Atlantic University,
which is part of the Florida state—run
university system and has an enrollment
of more than 11,000 students.

_ ‘‘It’s a large campus with ample
opportunity for expansion,” Quatroche
said. “Right now, it’s primarily an upper-
division institution, with mostly juniors,
seniors and graduate students. But for the

past several years, they've been admitting
freshmen. It’s earmarked to be one of the
principal campuses in the state university
system in a relatively short period of time.”

Quatroche said that if he is selected, the
position will be a culmination of the years
he has invested in college administration.

“[The presidency} would represent an
opportunity  to exercise leadership at
the highest level and to hopefully bring to
bear on the position of president an
accumulation of my experience over the
years, most notably what I've done here at
the University of Pittsburgh,” said
Quatroche.

Quatroche became a member of Pitt’s
administration in 1972, after completing
graduate school at the university. His past
positions. include a four-year tenure as

one of Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s
principal assistants, before assuming his
current office as secretary of the university
and Board of Trustees that he has held for
eight years. Quatroche said his 16 years at
Pitt have provided him with the
qualifications needed to head a university.

“As a member of the senior staff at [Pitt],
Ifeell have some particular expertise and
some important insights to lead an
institution of higher education. They’re
looking for someone with a vision," he
said.

According to Quatroche, the current 12
candidates will be narrowed down to
between four and six by a local FAU
committee and the Board of Regents
Selection Committee today. Between Sept.
14 and 29, those remaining candidates will

visit FAU for extensive two-day interviews.

The new president will be appointed
around Oct. ‘ 11, according to The
Independent/ulantic Sun, FAU’s campus
newspaper, with the position beginning
sometime in January. I A

“My career to date at the University of
Pittsburgh has been a very satisfying one;
it’s been very rewarding. But being a
candidate for president represents the
ultimate opportunity for someone [like
me] who has been in administrative life
for so long. I’m a bit of a pragmatist; I
recognize my competition is very high. So
we’ll have to see where it goes. But right
now, I’m just glad to be one of the
contenders, along with some very excellent
people from other colleges and universities
around the country.”

 
  
 

For many students, fall classes

mean living away from home for

the first time. This is why Pitt
selects some juniors and seniors
as resident assistants to come to
the aid of those who need it.
There are about 80 R.A.s who
are responsible for the well-being

 of the students living in their
*1}.

dorms. Bernie Comfort, a first-
year R.A., described an R.A. as
“someone who is responsible for
a lot of floors and a lot of students.
We enforce housing rules and
regulations.” '

An R.A. spendstwo duty nights
on call, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., per
week. When on call, they stay in
their rooms and are easily found
if they are needed.

Another first-year R.A., Jerry

Beat, said, “An R.A. is never
really off—duty.” In the event of
an emergency, an R.A. is required
to take constructive action.

Duties of an R.A. range from
quieting noisy residents to
evacuating the dorm in case of a
fire.

The R.A.s are also expected to
take charge in. the event of
anything from a suicide attempt
or an assault to a mild altercation

or an intoxicated student.

Part of the job requires that

R.A.s fulfill seven duty weekends
per year. On a duty weekend,
they patrol the floors of their
dorms, enforcing policies and
providing security.
According to Brian Swank, an
R.A. in Tower B, there is a precise
way to handle violations of the
alcohol policy.

“The first thing [I would] do if

PPC opens photo exhibition

By Suzanne Sabol
Staff Writer

Loveis in the air and also on
the walls of the William Pitt Union
Art Gallery this week with the
showing of Weddings Around
the World.

‘WeddingsAround the World is
a photography exhibit displaying
ethnic wedding traditions. The
show, which is PPC’s ﬁrst art
exhibit of the year, fits in with the
PPC’s theme of “Multinational
Week.”

“This show is international. It’s
broad and not just focused on
one country,” said Martha Moranz,
who is PPC’s Art Committee
chairwoman.

The exhibit has 77 photographs,
representing over 25 different
cultures. Photographer Katrina
Thomas traveled and took photos
for 12 years to complete the
Weddings show.

Thomas’ introduction to the
exhibit explained that “weddings

a lot of hype.
I ]llSl want
something I  
can count on.”

Some long distance
companies promise you

really want is dependable,

you choose AT&T Long

which keep traditions represent
ethnic cultures in their purest
forms. Weddings are true
celebrations of cultural identity.”

Each picture is explained in a
pamphlet guide, and plaques
which describe wedding laws,
gifts and rites of passage were
placed in the gallery. Other
plaques explain the signiﬁcance
of wedding veils, costumes and
family and religious ceremonies.

The exhibit, which is on loan to
the PPC from the Balch Institute
of Ethnic Studies, will be open
during ‘he week of Sept. 11, said
Moranz.

The PPC also plans to have
more diverse art shows this year
“to attract people ’s attention,” she
said. “There’s so much going on,
there’s something for everyone.”

One example of the diversity
of the exibits can be seen at the
Marson Galleries from Sept. 26-
28, according to PPC program
coordinator Dana Keefer. This
show will be a collection of

In November, Rolling Stone
magazine will be having an
exhibit in the WPU Assembly
room. According to Moranz, “this
will be a big show.”

However, the AIDS quilt this
spring may be the most popular
exhibit of the year. The squares
of the AIDS quilt contain personal
momentos from AIDS victims.

Coinciding with the showing
of the AIDS quilt will be a dance
show by the Dance Teller, a
show _ which Moranz has
previewed.

“The dance show deals with
AIDS,” she said, “and the theme
is intense.”

The PPC Art Committee will

T 132 for a taste of South Philly

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

As a native of the city of
brotherly love, I must admit I was
skeptical as I walked through the
door of G’s subs shop on Centre
Avenue in Oakland, under the
sign that read “a taste of South
Philly.”

South Philly is to subs (or
hoagies) lovers what Mecca is to

Muslims, and it seems like every ‘

steak shop in the Pittsburgh area
offers sandwiches made “just like
in South Philly.”

I was first surprised to find
myself in a museum of pop
culture. There are classic rock
posters all over the walls,
including an entire section of a
wall dedicated to the Grateful
Dead.

If the novelty of posters for
Beatles movies doesn’t strike you,
there is the beam that is covered
with wallpaper made of old
newspapers.

I decided to give G’s the true
Philadelphia test after seeing the
sign outside, and ordered the
Original Italian Ieloagie. If there
was one word that ran through
my mind as I ate, it was “fresh.”

The sandwich was huge, on
the freshest roll I can remember
in months (I later found out that
the rolls are delivered from the
strip district every morning).
Another nice thing is that they
didn’t heat the sub, an unpleasant
surprise I got the first time I
ordered a sub in Pittsburgh three
years ago.

To top it off, the sandwich was
covered with oil. Suddenly, the

sign didn’t seem so arrogant. For
under five dollars, I felt like I was
home, like when my dad took me
out after Phillies games.

G5 is located at 4632 Centre
Avenue, where Pete’s Pitt used to

be. It is open until 4 a.m., so .

North Oakland finally has a late
night restaurant to compete with
the Original Hot Dog Shop and
Primanti Brothers. After a night in
the bars, (is would be a nice
place to grab» something to eat.

About the only thing I didn’t
like was the temperature, as the
air conditioning kept it a little
cool. Of course, this could 
because of the strange weather
we’ve been having lately, or just
be an off day.

If not, being a little cool is a

small price to pay to get South ‘

Philly food in the Mon Valley.

“Originally the entire board was
very excited about the conference,
but it ended up that Harper
Watters, Justin Lawhead and
myself were the three who would
head up the planning,” she said.

The conference was first
scheduled to take place in April

1989. It was then pushed back to
August to coincide with the Three
Rivers Regatta. Again the planning
could not be completed and the
conference was postponed again.

“We had a really tough time
getting all three of us together
over the summer," said Shepard.
“[Urban 13 is] something that
requires much more planning
than we had realized and summer
jobs took away from the time we
needed to plan.”

In addition to the time
problems, SBG member Justin
Lawhead said brochures
describing the conference sent
out at the end of July were
reportedly not received by the
schools to whom they were
addressed.

“The mailing problems we had
certainly didn't help us get the
conference plans finalized in time
for this weekend,” said Lawhead.

At present, there are no plans
to reschedule the conference.
However, according to both

Shepard and Lawhead, the I

conference is not necessarily
defunct.

“If I indeed run for [SGB]
president in November and am in
a position to try again for the
conference [I may pursue itl,"
said Shepard. “It would have to
depend on the commitment of
those people on the new board.”

Three of the 13 invited schools
had agreed to attend the now
cancelled conference. They were:
the University of Houston, the
University of Missouri at St. Louis
and the University of Missouri at
Kansas City.

R.D. But you’re not the police.
You can’t conﬁscate it or forcibly

Swank also said that he would
knock on a door if he smelled
marijuana. He also said he would
definitely call the R.D., because
“pot is much more serious than
alcohol. The R.D. would be able
to call Campus Police [while I
dealt with the situation.]"

Besides being authority figures,
R.A.s are also activities directors.
They schedule and provide the
residents with a large variety of
activities that keeps residents

informed and encourages‘

friendship. .
According to the handbook that
the R.A.s follow, the activities fall
into eight categories:
0 Community service, like blood
drives or the Special Olympics;

0 Diversity, with the
international food festival as an
example;

-Emotional, including

programs to help residents deal
with compulsive behavior and
other problems;

-Intellectual, providing
residents with tutoring and
registration tips; ‘

-Occupational, designed to
help residents find a summer job
or plan a ﬂoor trip to the
Placement Office;

0 Physical, with martial arts and
safe tanning programs among
those offered; I

0 Social, including cookouts and

_ pizza parties that let the residents

get to know one another;
-Values, such. as programs
designed to teach residents about
racism.»
“We’ve had a football game

I with the fourth ﬂoor, and a tuck-

in with a girls ﬂoor,” Swank said.

“We’ll probably have a few more

of those type of events later in the
yeah”

Swank also said that he is
planning visits to the counseling
center and the career center, as
well as programs on alcohol and
AIDS for his ﬂoor.

Finally, an R.A. acts as a friend
to the residents. He is encouraged
to get to know all of the residents
and build a rapport with each
one. He can also offer advice or
set a. good example for the

residents, and help someone

when he can.

Comfort said, “We are here to
make life easier.”

“We do our best to be role
models,” Beat said.

In exchange for all of the hard '

work that they do, R.A.s receive
free room and board for the
academic year as compensation
for the time they devote to their
jobs.

“I like my job. I like it a lot,”
Beat said.

Comfort said, “I'm having a

C311 1'€ligi011be 3 killer?   August proves a month to rernember

Some overtly religious” people believe that they should
go to church every Sunday. Others believe that they ‘
should donate as much time and money as possible to
their chosen faith. There are even people who dedicate
their entire lives to serving the church. And then there are
those who allow their children to die in the name of God.

A former Seventh-day Adventist pastor and his wife .
from Nuangola were recently charged with the starvation
death of their 14-year-old son. It seems that Larry and
Leona Cottam were afraid of losing their children if they
went to the authorities, so they allowed their son Eric to

starve to death.

It seems that the Cottarns came to distrust society after
their two children told stories of sexual abuse by their
parental grandparents and a Seventh-day Adventist leader.

Although they had $3,775 set aside as an offering to
God, the family decided to fast. They believed that to
spend that money would be the same as stealing from

God.

Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution,
:3; but there is something wrong when parents would allow
their child to suffer a death as horrible as one by starvation
when it could have easily been prevented- Didn’t they
even stop to think that maybe God would have given
them a loan in order to preserve the life of an innocent

young boy?

Like so many religious fanatics, the Cottarns believed
that God would rescue them from starvation and there-
fore, they cannot be held legally responsible for the death

of their son in early January.

It is hard to believe that there, are people in today's

society who allow their loved ones to die while they aw-ait
 a present—day miracle. The children of such people must

not be allowed to suffer for the stupidity of their parents.

September may not be the
greatest month, but at least it
rescued us from August. That
month, lest we forget, begot the
20th anniversary of Woodstock,
the deification of the moocher
generation. Maybe now we can
celebrate something more bene-
ficial, like the 10th anniversary of
the death of John Wayne.

Speaking of trifling matters, the A

prestigious Pittsburgh Press ran a
three-part series on Satanism.
Misnomered “Rumors from Hell,”
the piece did little more than
sensationalize a subject that craves
publicity. The series accom-
plished that by creating new
rumors and exhurning old ones.
Perhaps a better title would have
been “Rumors from the Boule-
vard of the Allies .”

Remember the Reverend
George Stallings, the renegade
priest who opened up a branch
office of Roman Catholicism
which served only non-whites?
Well, now he’s really done it. The
Washington Post has reported
that a former altar boy of Stallin gs
admitted to having “oral sex two
or three times a week” with the
“reactionary” back in 1977. The
report did not say whether the
former altar boy was black or
white.

While on the subject of Wash-
ingtonians under the thumb
screw, Barney Frank, Democratic
congressman, inactive lawyer,
homosexual wonderboy and

general jackass-of—all—trades, is
now not only in danger of forfeit-
ing hislicense to practice law but
also suspected of using his con-

gressional inﬂuence to negate"

parking tickets that his gay lover
acquired. Oh, for the good ol’
days when a parking ticket was a
penalty and homosexuality was
considered (gasp!) immoral.

  

Combining the religious cuck-
ooness. of Stallings and the sexual
misadventures of Frank, is the
most Reverend Jimmy Bakker.

Before Bakker was to appear in,

court, he received a divine order
to stick his head under his attor-
ney’s couch. Only the thought of
Tammy joining him persuaded
Bakker to leave. Rumor has it that
Bakker will write memoirs de-
scribing how he was railroaded
by the press. His co-author is said
to-be Lyndon LaRouche. The book
will be classified as both autobio-
graphical and science—fiction.
The entire country was rail-
roaded last Tuesday when George
Bush announced a $7.9 billion
plot to combat drugs. Funds will
be spent to make extra prints of
the classic pot movie, ReeferMad-
ness and various Cheech and
Chong films. The latter is espe-
cially successful in deterring the
youth from being one with the

doobie.

In Schuylkill County a pigeon-
shoot was protested by people
who have absolutely nothing

better to do. Across the nation in

South Park, Pa., “Mother Cluk’s"

won first place in the Third Annual 4

Allegheny County Rib Cook-off,
where no protesters were sighted.
It seems pigs are not as aestheti-
cally pleasing as pigeons.

When you think of protesters
you also think of the liberal—wing

of the Democratic Party. At least.
that’s what the Democratic Na- ,

tional Committee chief Ron
Brown thinks. Last week__ Brown
finally admitted that the extreme
liberalism of Democrats likeJesse
Jackson and Teddy» Kennedy

might be responsible for their .

futile White House quest every
four years. Brown also discov-
ered that rubbing two sticks to-
gether makes a fire and that the
world is actually round.
Rounding of f this hectic news-
filled week, a retirement home
was created in San Antonio—~ for

chimpanzees, Donald Trump will 4

have his own game show, a les-
bian pleaded “battered spouse”
as reason for wasting her com-
mon-law “wife,” and a sunken
cow was discovered off the Alas-
kan coast. Where are the animal-
rights activists when you really
need them? « *

Pitt offers dorm students an ‘independent living environment’

Just who do the powers that be
at Pitt think they're kidding,
anyway?

I have been exposed to univer-
sity policies (or lack thereof) on
topics ranging from tuition bills
to parking lots. The logic behind

. their actions has often eluded

me, but I have always assumed
the logic was present— even if in
minute quantities. However, two
recent developments in Pitt’s
policy for on-campus residents
demonstrate that this is not the
case.

Recently Pitt decided that stu-
dents living in residence halls
must purchase a meal plan. Sev-

eral reasons for this action were
listed: one was to encourage

~ students with kitchen facilities in

their suites to use the cafeterias

 

more often. Also, over 90 percent
of resident students purchase
meal plans anyway. To make
mandatory meal plans a more
palatable concept, Choice Dol-

lars was introduced.

The second development was

splashed across the front page of -

Thursday’s issue of The Pitt News.
The students in Schenley Quad-
rangle are cleaning their bath-
rooms themselves this year.
According to a memo issued to
the residents, bathroom house-
keeping has ceased in order to
offer the students “an independ-
ent living environment”

If Pitt truly intended to offer a
little independent living (and we
can only assume the faceless
people in housing who concocted
this really believe it), then why
simultaneously require students
to purchase meals through Pitt’
The idea of independence di-
rectly conflicts with the concept

of a mandatory meal plan. Unless
Pitt will admit to another motive
for their actions (revenue?), the
policies enacted are highly in-
consistent. The people in the
Housing Office were unable to
answer any questions, thereby
reinforcing my assumption that
their motives are unclear. I re-
ceived reassurances that some-
one who did know the answers
would return my call. Needless to
say, they haven't called back.

In order to help the seemingly
confused members of our bu-
reaucracy resolve this nasty little
inconsistency, I am offering a
few suggestions: 1.Doaway with

mandatory meal plans. Allowing
residents to freely choose how,
where and when they eat is deﬁ-
nitely a step toward “independ-
ent living.” And if it’s any-conso-
lation, over 90 percent of the
residents will choose a meal plan
anyway.

2. Skip the curfew for guests.
Students in an “independent liv-
ing environment" should be able
to determine when a guest has
overstayed his or her welcome.

3. And why not -- let them
clean their own bathrooms.

‘Soccer team pulls out

2-1 Victory in overtime

By Sean Heilman
For The Pitt News

Mike ‘ Blatz and Ivan Amayo
each _scored goals in overtime to
lead the Pitt soccer team to a 2-1
win over California, Pa., on
Saturday.

The victory gave Pitt its. second

‘swim in as many games this season.

The Panthers expected a tough
game from a physically strong
Vulcan squad.

“We knew they had a new
English coach [Rob Eaton] and
new English players so we knew
they would be more skilled than
in the past -

- “They are a big, strong team
similar to Slippery Rock [who Pitt

L ,_beat 2-1 last Wednesday]. But
 they are slower and not as skilled,”

said Pitt co-captain Sam Lanza.

Pitt tried to force the California
defenders into making a mistake,
especially early in the game when
California seemingly could not
advance the ball forward against
tje tough Pitt defense. However’,
the Panthers could not put the
right passes together to take the
lead.

“We had to use the ball well,”
said Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher,
“and we didn’t do that in the first
half. _

“We were playing the ball in
the air [too much]. We were very
lethargic.”

The first half ended in a
scoreless tie.

Luxbacher gave his S’ team a
motivational speech at halftime,
hoping to fire up his players.

“He said we weren't playing
well at all,” said Blatz. “He said
we were playing at [California’s]
speed.”

Luxbacher said the team played
better in the second half, but that
did not change the score which
remained 0-0.

The Panthers had numerous
chances to score in the second
half but ran into a brick wall at
the California goal.

California goalie Evan Mungai
made nine saves in the second
half alone, sending the game into
overtime.

In overtime, Luxbacher moved
Blatz from the midﬁeld to forward.

“We were playing to win,” said

Panthers up mark to 2-0 with 29-10 win over BC   

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. — A
number of bizarre first-half plays
and great defense throughout the
whole game keyed the Pitt
football team to a 29~1O victory
over the Boston College Eagles
on Saturday.

The bizarre plays started after
BC’s first possession of the game i
when the usually sure-handed
Henry T uten attempted to ﬁeld a »
BC punt that he should have let
go. Tuten fumbled the ball and
BC recovered‘ on the Pitt 51-yard
line.

. Just four plays later, BC’s Brian
Lowe set up to attempt a 50-yard
field goal. Lowe’s kick never made
it past the line of scrimmage as
Pitt defensive tackle Marc S pindler
got his 6-foot-5 frame in the air to
bat the ball back deep into BC
territory.

Pitt’s offense advanced the ball
just 10 yards, and they settled for
an Eddie Frazier field‘ goal and a
3-0_ lead. .

Pitt’s running game, which is
expected to account for most of
Pitt’s offense this season, managed '
only 77 yards on the day. Curvin
Richards, who ran for 112 yards
last week against Pacific, ran for
43 yards on 16 carries.

Freshman quarterback Alex Van
Pelt had another impressive
outing in his first away football
game. Van‘ Pelt completed 157-18
passes for 216 yards and two
touchdowns. -

Van Pelt also looked impressive if
in areas other than statistics. His
play action fakes are so good
they fool just about everyone in
the stadium. On a third-down
play in the second quarter, Van
Pelt showed good composure for
a young player. Van Pelt dropped
back and a fierce blitz by BC
linebacker David Thompson
came from the blind side. Van
Pelt got rid of the ball just as
Thompson hit him and completed if
the pass to fullback Ronald‘
Redmon for a 34-yard gain.

“I knew he was coming; I could
feel him,” said Van Pelt. 5‘The ‘
play is designed that if they blitz, i
it turns into a screen pass. I didn’t
see him catch the ball, but I didn’t
hear any cheering from the crowd,
so I figured something happened
for us." _ ,

But Pitt’s defense was the big
story throughout the game. In

fact, Pitt’s defense is so deep, two ’

different teams wéie used in the ’
hot Boston sun. ” ‘ .
“We played a lot of people.
Our whole idea is to play two
defenses,” said Pitt head coach
Mike Gottfried. “On this day I
think that may have been the
difference. it kept “uslfresh for the
fourth éjuarter:"Our’jsec6nd team
did well, there's alot of young
guysin tl1é‘re;,;I’m"very7pleased.”
Pitt is especially‘ deep in the
defensive line‘, and ‘they proved
that about eight of them could

 we had a bunch of sacks and

tackles for a loss. 1- think we're a
dominant front line, ‘I said
defensive tackle Tony Siragusa;
“We have a defense that's going

' to attack the offense. We make

things happen.” 

Pitt’s defense made it happen
again just three plays after Fraziefs ..
first ﬁeld goal.

BC quarterback
Kamphaus threw a pass that had

a similar fate to BC’s last ﬁeld‘

goal attempt. Jeff Esters got a
hand on the ball at the line of
scrimmage, and defensive tackle
Tom Sims came up with an
interception.

Six plays and 28 yards later, Pitt

Mark I

had a 10-0 lead in the first quarter.
The drive was capped offby a 18-
yard screen pass touchdown from
Van ' Pelt to Richards. Richards
caught. the ball on the 20-yard

line, put a move on BC’s All- _

American safety Rico Labbe, and
skirted into the end zone.
With Pitt leading 13-0 late in

the second quarter, Spindler and

Carnell Smith teamed up for the
Panther’s first defensive points of
the season.

Kamphaus dropped back to
pass, but all his receivers were
covered. His pass protection
broke down as Spindler and Smith
got in striking range. Spindler got
there ﬁrst, and his hit jarred the
ball out of Kamphaus’ hands.
The ball landed in Smith’s hands
and the 6-3, 260-pound defensive

end ran 57 yards for the TD,
giving Pitt a 20-Olead. _

“I was about to get the sack. I
didn’t see Marc Corning, and I
was just there,” said Smith.

'1 thought he already threw the ,

ball downﬁeld,‘ said Spindler.
“Then Ilooked up and sawthis

bowlegged guy running _d0Wn -

the ﬁeld.” V ‘ '
The Eagles had one more shot
at a first-half score. They moved
into Pitt territory, and with under
one rriinute left, Kamphaus
appeared to have wide receiver
Kenrick Skerritt open at the goal
line. Kamphaus launched a
perfect pass that was almost right
in Skerritt’s hands. That was
before Pitt cornerback Alonzo
Hampton, who appeared to be
beat on the play, dove in front of

“I really shouldn't be doing it,

_ half with a 30-yard ﬁeld goal by

Lowe with 8536- remaining in the
third quarter. Van Pelt was sacked
for a 21-yard loss four plays later
and Brian‘ Greenﬁeld was called
on the punt for Pitt.

BC All-American candidate
Marcus Cherry took the punt at
the 24-yard line, went left but
saw nothing but Panthers. He
turned, went backward aboutﬁve
yards, cut right and managed to
get around the pursuing Pitt
players. He cut back into the
middle where Tom Huebner
tripped him up around midﬁeld.
Huebner was the last Panther
Cherry had to beat or it was
smooth sailing into the end zone.

The punt return got the game
momentum in the Eagles’ favor,
and on the second play BC
tailback Mike Sanders carried the
ball inside the Panther 10-yard
line. He would have scored had.
Marcus Washington not run him
down.

The third quarter ended and
the drive went to the BC students’
end of the ﬁeld. With 4,000 BC
students screaming for their team,
fullback Ed Toner made the score
20-9. Lowe's extra point made it
20-10. ’

comeback 34-31 win still
lingering, Pitt was in need of
regainingthe momentum.

Pitt's offense responded with a
solid 77-yard drive deep into BC’s
side of the. ﬁeld. But Ronald.
Redmon fumbled on the 32-yard

line, leaving Pitt's drive empty.

The momentum was shifting
again- Pitt's defense, ‘which
already had numerous big plays
in the game, was in need of
another one.

' Pitt got that big play from Smith.
The next play, Smith sacked
Kamphaus in the end zone for
the safety. The sack not only
gave Pitt two points, but more
important, gave Pitt the ball back.
Smith had eight points on the
day, second only to Frazier’s nine,
for the team leader.

Pitt drove in for their final
touchdown on their next

possession. Van Pelt hit Tuten for .

a S—yard TD pass making the
score 29-10.

Panther Notes: Marc Spindler
led Pitt in tackles with nine. Craig
Gob added seven, Prentiss Wright,
Alonzo Hampton, Dan Crossman,
Marcus Washington, Curtis Bray
and Tony Siragusa all had four.
Carnell Smith, Siragusa, and Keith
Hamilton all had sacks for the

Panthers. Late in the fourth
quarter, Hampton came up with A

second interception. _It resembled
his ﬁrst one, except Marcus Cherry
was the intended receiver. Robert‘
Bradley had an interception on
the last BC play of the game.

Curvin Richards’ 43 yards rushing

  THE ORIGINAL Ho

 

 



Steelers

Continued from page 9

All that was missing was a half
time appearance by the bubonic
plague.

Now, it all started out fairly
innocently enough. The teams
exchanged three basic punts, and
the game initially appeared as if
it would be another grind—it-out,
rough-and-tough Steelers-Browns
brawl which would suit the
game’s 2-point pregame spread.

Then all hell broke loose for

Pittsburgh, detonated by a hinge L

in the form of the Steelers rookie
running back Tim Wor1ey’s right
arm. ',

Al Bryan Wagner punt pinned
the Steelers at their own ﬁve
yard-line, giving the team its
second possession. Pittsburgh
head coach Chuck Noll calledlfor
his troops to run a right trap to
Worley. Instantly after the hand-
off, Cleveland defensive end
Robert Banks stripped the ball
behind the line of scrimmage,
where linebacker Clay Matthews
was able to scoop it up and pop
into the endzone. 7-0, Brownies
on the drop of a Pittsburgh Nipple
Works cap.

On the very next Steeler
possesion, the high-priced Worley
fumbled again, this time at the
Pittsburgh 27. Cleveland’s Matt
Bahr then booted a field goal to
take a 10-0 "lead.

“I had a bad game,” said Worley,
after the Steelers publicity director
Dan Edwards ﬁnally convinced
him to discuss matters with the

press postgame in the locker
room. “I'm just a rookie. I’m
allowed to make mistakes. I've
had days like this before.” Keep
that to yourself, Mr.’ Worley.
People take fumbles around her

very personally. W

Continuing, on the very, very
next Steeler possession, wide
receiver Louis Lipps ran a reverse

and headed toward the left

sideline. But for some odd reason,
he avoided the daylight ahead of

{him and cut back into the mass
of bodies waiting to clutter his” 

path. Carl Hairston and

“Our mental toughness " was

On the very first play of Act II,
Worley fumbled a third time, now
at the Steelers own 27. Four plays
later, Manoa digging around in

again and this time quarterback
Bubby Brister attempted a pass
out of the shotgun formation.
This one was picked off at the
Steeler 14 and returned for a
touchdown by that Grayson cat,
who was just all over the field on
Sunday. 44-zip.

“It was the worst defeat I’ve
ever been associated with,” said
Brister. “I played a terrible game.

something it turned into a
disaster.”

He completed only 10 of 22
passes and had three intercepted,
although the other two were
harmless bombs into the endzone
that the Browns could do nothing
with. A little pass protection would
have helped matters for Brister,
though. .

“[Cleveland defenders] were in
his face all day,” said Noll. “He

anything."

“I'm not gonna stand here and
crack on my offensive line. It’s
not my style,” Brister announced
when his lack of pass security in
the pocket was mentioned. Well,
think it then, Bubby. You’d have
hadmore time standing behind a
celophane sheet taped to two
carnival sticks.

A brilliant 21-yard run by off-
season acquisition Mike Oliphant
(48 yards) early in the fourth
quarter mercifully ended the
Browns’ assault.

The game was a happy debut
for Cleveland head coach Bud
Carson, a man who takes over a
team supposedly on the
downswing. His quarterback,
Bernie Kosar (16-27, 207 yards)
was in midseason form. Even the
revamped defensive line looked
potentially stronger that it was
during any season Marty
Schottenheimer was head coach.
Rookie running back Eric Metcalf
displayed potential in his debut.

But as miserably as the Steelers
played, well, you can temporarily
put a big fat asterisk beside this
Cleveland win. All it proved was
that the “Pitts” in Pittsburgh is
now there for a reason. '

_Of all 11 positions on the soccer
field, the sweeper is one of the
most important. He is the la’
defender before the goalkeeper,
which means that a lot of pressure
comes with the position.

A Pitt’s sweeper is senior Heinz
Pak. .

“I like the pressure,” said Pak.
“It’s the only way to play.”

Pitt soccer coachjoe Luxbacher
has Pak at sweeper because Pak

can control the game from that“

position. 1 “We use him a
lot to switch ﬁelds for us,” said
Luxbacher. “He knows when to
play the ball forward and when
to turn and give it back to the
keeper.” ‘

Although Pak is the sweeper,
he fills a large role in the offensive
attack of the Panthers as well.

On set plays off free kicks in
front of the opponent’s goal, Pak
is always involved.

“I’m naturally 1eft—footed, ang
[Coach Luxbacher] likes to have
that left foot-right foot option up
there,” said Pak. “Also, Iwas one
of the leading goal scorers last
year.” I L ‘

Nevertheless, he remains strong
and solid in the defensive end.

Luxbacher also has a lot o()
conﬁdence in Pak.

“He is a leader for us. He
controls the team and the game.”

“I like to lead by example,
rather than yell and scream at my
teammates,” said Pak. “I try to
keep my teammates in order.”

Luxbacher added that Pak is an

' asset because of his speed and

experience. Luxbacher thinks that
Pak can still play at a higher level‘
After graduation Pak said he

would like to continue his soccer A

career.
“I wouldlove to go to Europe
and play. I spent six months

playing in Germany for a team
called Tus Hren, which is a
Division III team. I was scouted
by a few [Division 1] teams,” said
Pak.

Luxbacher. “I’d just as soon losﬁ
than tie.”

A The move accounted for the
first goal of the game 20 seconds
into the first overtime period.
Blatz took a long pass from Heinz
Pak into the right corner, ﬂipped

the ball over Mungai’s head, and»,
raced to the loose ball in front of “

the empty net.

Amayo’s goal came when Scott
Alexander’s shot from the right
side deﬂected off Mungai’s hand“)
to Amayo in front of the net. The
goal was scored with two minutes
left in the second overtime period.

California scored on a penalty

3 kick by Rob Aldinager with less

than a minute to go in the second
overtime period. .3,

THE PITT‘ NEWS, Monday, September 11, 1989

 

By Adam Kamras
For The Pitt News

Pitt men’s tennis coach George

"jDieffenbach is expecting this

year’s team to improve
substantially as they prepare for
their first competition slated for
Sept. 12 at Fairmont State in West
Virginia.

Dieffenbach’s squad, which
finished 11-11 overall and sixth
in the Big East Conference last

,_,year, returns seven lettermen led

by seniors Vivek Kumar and Paul

Maven. The team also returns
juniors Jeff Mills and Tery
O’Connor, and sophomores Larry
Garrard, John Tegano and Joel
Orth.

Dieffenbach said one of the
reasons why they should improve
is the addition of freshman
Terence Rosenthal, who has a
chance to gain the No. 1 spot on
the team. Mills was the No. 1
player last year, and the two will
be competing for the top spot
this year.

“The keys to victory this year

Dieffenbach’s main goals for
this year’s individual tennis
players are for them to excel
academically and for Kumar and
Maven to graduate.

As far as the tennis team is
concerned Dieffenbach said, “I
want all of our players to improve
their tennis, and to improve upon
their finish in the Big East. I want
to compile a winning record."

Yet Dieffenbach admitted that
Pitt doesn't quite stack up against
the other teams in the East.

“We're not there yet,” said
Dieffenbach, “but we can be
competitive with the entire
conference. We’re improving
steadily every year.”

He predicts Boston College,

« perennial conference winner, will
keep its No. 1 spot. Dieffenbach
is looking for a third-place finish,
but feels his team has a shot. to
battle St. John’s for the No. 1 spot.
