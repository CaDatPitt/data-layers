time since he came to Pitt last
year, said that he was glad that
he had been invited to give a

dealt with ﬁnances in relation to
the faculty. He said that he hopes

to announce to the faculty today i

an increase in their
status.”

He also informed the students
of his intentions of having a full-
time faculty and new courses for

Viruses

and both, a living organism and
a chemical substance. This revo-
lutionary discovery was further
enhanced when scientists in
California and Germany took
the virus particle apart and sep-
arated it into protein and nu-
cleic acid fragments, later pull-
ing the virus back together by
simply pouring these chemical
products into a bottle and stir-
ring. The lifeless particle was

reformed and then turned into

 

a living virus.

It would appear to the layman
that scientists are close to discov-
ering a way to create life by mix—-
ing up a batch of chemicals, but
actually the secret of God’s crea-
tion is still in the hands of the
Almighty. What is important,
however, is that the powers of the
disease-spreading virus are better
understood, which is the first step
in combatting its ill effects on
man and disdovering ways to make
beneﬁcial use of it.

The Four Ilumlrell  

As if in response to an unspoken need for a cultural
re-awakening on the part of Pitt students, some 400 stu-
dents have participated in the eighth annual Poetry Read-
ing Festival preliminaries.‘

A spirit of academic adventure seemed to set the mood
for the readings as students selected, for the most part, -the
poems of contemporary writers, Which aremore difficult

to interpret and deliver.

Some original writings yvere also presented at the read-
ings and added even greater impetus to the enthusiastic
interest of so many students in the competition.

An interest in such artistic activities as the reading of
poetry on the part of so many students should serve as a
heartening demonstration to those who have been casting

sidewise glances at the Pitt factory.
Faculty, too, caught the enthusiasm of the events and.

attended the readings in record number. Their interest
showeda genuine desireto encourage and work for the

_ advancement of such events at Pitt.

The Festival itself will be held April 25. As a result
of the overwhelming response of the students to the con-
test, two sessions have been slated for that day. The Per.-
‘cival Hunt Award will be presented at the end of the sec-
ond session. ‘

It might be a good idea for students to check off the
date as one of special interest and to attend the ﬁnal com-
petitions to hear the winning readers. It should be a date
for all to remember. A

Thoroughly gracious, vivacious, and informa-

Chase Smith captivated her audience in a lecture
at Stephen Foster Memorial Hall, Saturday even-
ing, March 9. The lecture was one of the Pitcairn-
Crab series. _

The distinguished lady, speaking primarily to
members of the University fami-y " i ' ‘ 
1y, very tactfully began her ad-
dress with contrasts of formal
and informal education. She
modestly claimed not to “quali-
fy as an expert in formal edu-
cation.” A '

She continued, saying that,
informally, she has met and
spoken with nearly all the major
She could therefore -2-
“visualize ﬂesh and blood people” when she read
of the seizure of the Suez by Nasser, 01‘ the 1n‘

 

‘vasion of the same area by Britain and France-

Mrs. Smith has been exposed on an informal basis
to a vast international education.
Courtesy prevailed in all the countries she visit-

J ed, even though some of the discussions were de-

ceitful or unrewarding. The primary obstacle to
world peace is Russia. Who 15 the man to fear
in this country? It is not Bulganin or Khrushchev,

who are here today and may be gone tomorrow, ,

as the political complexion changes. H _

Miss Smith stated that it is antindividual who
has been in ‘the background of Russian politics

Bolshevik.” He is the “quarterback” in Russia’s
program and the U. S. has most to fear from him.
With his new position, he is again in the fore-
front. At the time Mrs. Smith conferred with
Molotov, no one knew where Khrushchev was. She
asked him‘ point blank what had happened. He
told her that he was visiting unofﬁcially Red China
and the atomic installations in Eastern Russia. The
U. S. must be very wary in dealing with Molotov.
No Discontent

The senator did not see discontent among the
Russian people. She reported that it is fallacious
to think that revolution is brewing in Russia. The
people have become accustomed to communism and
exhibit little fanatical thinking pro or con. The

student demonstrations at Moscow University prove ‘ J

nothing since students often exhibit immaturity
and mental independence far in excess of what
they show later in life. _
Nasser, in Egypt, means trouble for the U. S.
and the free world. He is a “dangerous egotist,”

who will do anything to save face. Furthermore, ’

he implied in a discussion with the senator that he
is “unsure of his position in his own country.”
Even in 1954, Nasser told Smith that he would have
no recourse but to trade with the Communist na-
tions if he found no markets for Egyptian cotton
in the free world. The'U. S. didn’t believe he
would dare, but later, he traded cotton for arms
in the satellites.

A Technic's Technique .« . .

  

Molotov, Nasser And Our Allies . . .

"’°“"  Mrs.» Smith of Maine

Although Egypt was saved by the U. N. on
principle in the Suez, she shows no interest in co-‘
operation with U. N. and no appreciation for what
the organization has done. The U. S. should not
make the same mistake with
made with Hitler. “Call his bluff early,” Senator
\mith urges.

Red China was the next trouble spot dealt with
by the senator.
China may be replacing Russia as leader of the
Communist world.” Will support of Chiang involve
the U. S. in war with Red China? Smith believes
not. Chiang will never reconquer the mainland
since the U. S. will never provide him with the
wherewithall to do it. She asserted that the

whole idea of reconquest of the mainland is tied”

to Chiang and will die with him. She further
‘stated that Chiang will- not “barter with Chou

and the Chinese Communists will not take For-7”’

mosa for fear of war with the U. S.
“Our two closest allies,” Britain and France,
have become. our two “major headaches.” First

of all, they’re an economic drain on the U. S. and

perhaps more important, their “dying grasp” on
colonialism, makes other nations fear U.S. because
of our relation with them. Churchill would never
have invaded Suez, according to Smith, and Di-
Gualle, a rightist, may soon succeed Mollett in turb-
ulent France. _ .

The U. S. has exhibited little understanding for
Nehru and the other neutrals. One day, the U. S.
ﬂatters Nehru, the next is “tactlessly blunt” with

him. Perhaps loans instead of grants would be»,-~

more advantageous to U. S. “Wait till he comes
for aid, do not force it on him.” Nehru is not afraid

of the Communists; he defeated them in his own ‘

country. When Eisenhower asked the senator -for
advice concerning proper treatmnet for Nehru, she
exclaimed that he “should” talk by phone with
Nehru every now and then.” It is not necessary to
seek his advice, but as an act of courtesy, he’d
like such a thing.

Senator Smith arrived at several pertinent gen-

eralities from the total world picture she pre-

sented. Our country has lost physical security it"

once had. ' The power to destroy the world rests‘
with its nations today. The conquer of space is
in the offing.

What changes have occured among nations?

The colonial powers are in the process of “disin’-
tegration,” and with it, become dependent on the
U. S. We lose strength because they have lost.
The Asia"-African has ‘cast off its shackles” and
is suspicious of the West,-susceptible to Russia
because of the lack of previous relations with that

‘country. These countries fail to recognize that

Communism is merely “Russian Colonialism.”

The development of “Neutrals” has ushered a
third dominant force in the world today. The out-
standing development is the “big paradox.” The
U. S. pretends nothing has changed in the last
few years. It is a human tendency tolresist change.
The U. S. must either “make most of the changes
or they’ll make mostof us.”

Matmen Defend E

Peery Changes Lineup

Seeking Fourth Straight

By CHRIS GILLOTTI _

Before last week’s 14-11 loss to Penn State the Panther
matmen were odds-on—favorites to repeat as Eastern cham-
pions, and the other Eastern schools were given little chance
to upset Coach Rex'Peery’s grapplers. NoW.however, Penn
State, Lehigh, and Navy are all hopeful of upending the
locals at the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association

_(EIWA) championships at Penn State this Friday and Sat-

I

urday. .
The Blue and Gold have ruled the EIWA ever since
entering in 1954. "That year they made their presence
feltwith a score of 37 to runnerup Penn State’s 25. The—fol-
lowing year they squeezed by State, 51-50, and last year
again nipped the Nittany Lions by a single point, 74-73.
, ”Only four champions from 1956 will be returning to
ldefend' their titles. Penn State’s “Mighty ‘Mites,” Sid
Nodland and Johnny Johnston, will hold forth at 123 and
130 pounds,’ respectively. ’
Nodland, out to protect an unbeaten year, will meet his

toughest match in Ed Peery, the National champion. Peery;
‘acknowledged as one of the top wrestlers, in the nation,

ﬁnished the dual meet season with a 10-0 record, and will

 attempt to sweep both the Easterns and NCAA ﬁnals to cap

off his senior year. I

Johnston, who lost only to Peery this year, will go
against Vic DeFelice, who is. dropping down from 137 pounds
to’ tackle the tough Lion. DeFelice, a junior from Canons-
burg, compiled an 8-2 record this season. The Canonsburg
junior ﬁnished third in both the Easterns and the NCAA
ﬁnals in 1956 at 137 pounds. . A 1

Lehigh’s Joe Gratto (137) is the third returning
champ, and will be put to the test by a host of top-
ﬂight grapplers led by Panther Ted Bienkowski, unbeaten
in dual meet competition; Penn State’s Johnny Pepe,
who compiled an 8-1 mark; and Pepe’s brother, Charley
Gratto from Cornell. ’

Dave -Johnson, the ﬁnal returning title, holder, will not‘
defend his 157—poundl crown, but will instead move up to
167 pounds in an attempt to keep that championship won by
Panther Don Huff last year. Johnson’s primary stumbling
block ‘would have been Syracuse’s Bill White, but White,
the runnerup at 167 pounds last year, will be competing in
the 177-pound class. ' , C

The 1147-pound class has been thrown gyvide open by the
graduation of tough Ed Eichelberger of Lehigh, twice win-
ner of the tourney’s most Valuable wrestler trophy. Bob
Bubb will be representing the Blue and Gold at this weight,
and will face a big obstacle in Dave Adams. Adams, defeate

With the ascension of_Johnson to a heavier weight
class, the 157-pound division is a scramble among Pitt’s
-Bob‘ Richardson, Lehigh’s Ed Hamer, Princeton’s Bill
Fortenbaugh, and Temple’s Gerry Scanlan.

_ Nick Swentosky, a surprise entry for ‘the Panthers, will
try to keep the 177-pound title won last year by Ed DeWitt

 iwho has used all of his varsity eligibility. Bill‘ White of
., ' Syracuse, Ray Smethurst of Cornell, Pete Newell of Colgate,
.  Ron Marshall of Franklin and Marshall, and Doug Volgenau

of‘ Navy are the favorites in the class.
In the heavyweight ranks Ron Schirf is the favorite.

I Schirf ﬁnished third in both the Easterns and- the NCAA’s

last year, and had only one draw to mar a perfect record

I this season. Schirf’s chief foes will be Franklin and Mar-
 shall’s‘ Charles Pfrommer, Syracuse’s Chuck Dinklemeyer,
I and Navy’s Tony Stremic.

Coach.Peery admits that the tournament will be
I rough going. “It’s going to be a scramble,” he said.
I y“There’s sure to be a greater distribution of points than
 in the past three years. Look for Lehigh, Cornell, Tem-
ple, Navy, and Syracuse to be right up in there along
with Penn State and us.”
‘ Although the Panthers’ brief membership in the EIWA
makes it impossible to rank their total record‘ against Penn
State’s 70 individual titles and twe‘lve team championships,

and ehigh’s 64 individual‘ crowns and twelve team cham-
pionships, a fourth championship in four years of competi-

tion would certainly give the Jungle Cats a name” in the an-
nals of Eastern college wrestling. Coach Peery refused to
permit himself to become too optimistic. “We'll show up,”
fact will be apparent to

Hurts Chances

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

Coach Rex Peery’s grapplers, regarded by the member
schools of the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association
- (EIWA) before the Penn State debacle as ‘a mat invincible,
proved again that invincibility is non—existent in athletics.
The Panthers were rated the scourge of the East prior to,
their 14-11 sidetracking by State; a sure repeat winner in!
the Easterns at University Park this Friday and Saturday.

‘ Peery viewed the proceedings in utter amazement. There
was’ no other way for him to view the meet after escaping de-
feat for such a prolonged period. Speidel, all smiles, was like

 a small child with a new toy when 177-pound Les Walters ap-
‘plied the clinching match triumph to assure the team win. .
Although a coach dislikes to see a 26-meet victory skein ﬁzzle
in the matter of a few minutes coupled with one or two judgments,
it is perhaps better for the 54th EIWA classic at University Park this
weekend. The reversal has removed the invincible reputation of the
Peerymen, replacing it with one of less awe.
_ Previouslycthe Jungel Cats were heralded as prohibitive favor-
’ ites to capture their fourth straight Eastern title.‘ They are now, at
the most, only a slight favorite. Whereas they have escaped with
1 treacherous one-point verdicts in the last two mat carnivals, Coach
, Peery will consider his forces fortunate if they are able to ﬁnish
ahead of Penn State and Lehigh by an identical spread this year.
The major and most realistic reason why the locals are given
no better than a 50-50 chance to retain the coveted crown is not

 

because of the loss to State. Instead it is due to the ineligibility
for the second semester of 177- Or
pound Tom Alberts. ~Alberts,
one of the strong fortes in the
. 3 Peery chain, was declared scho-
lastically ineligible. B e s i d e s
weakening the 177-pound divi-
sion to where the Panthers no '
longer are a serious threat,.it
has coerced Peery into juggling
his lineup in the 147, 157, and
167 pound classes. V
Peery, interchanging men out of
necessity, will have to use the cir-
cus act more cautiously than ever
at the Easterns where the opposing
omentors will endeavor to ﬁgure
 .1‘ out what men wrestling at what

“weights will give their team
enough points to dethrone the
Panthers.
