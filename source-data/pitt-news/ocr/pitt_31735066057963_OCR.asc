Sexual assault allegations reported

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

A Pitt student, 19, has told
police she was sexually
assaulted at a fraternity party
by a gang of males who
charged into a bathroom
after she was involved in
intimate relations with anoth-
er man.

Despite her complaints, no
criminal charges have been
filed because, Pitt Public
Safety Director Rick Boyd
said, Public Safety has
run into identification prob-
lems.

'The victim told police
while at a party at the Phi

Gamma Delta (FIJI) house
on Sept. 10, she consented
to have sex with one individ-
ual. While still in the bath-
room, a group of males
entered and began to fondle
her breasts and genitals
and rubbed their penises
against her body. This infor-
mation was confirmed
by Leon Haley, vice chancel-
lor for student and public
affairs.

“Our understanding is
that the incident is being
investigated, and I will be
talking with the judicial
board director to determine
what happens next,” Haley
said.

FIJI fraternity President
Chris Nolan and
Interfraternity Council
President Brian Rifkin each
said they had no comment
on the incident. However,
Alpha Epsilon Phi President
Megan Fackler confirmed
Nolan spoke about the inci-

dent at last week’s
Panhellenic Association
meeting.

Fackler also confirmed that
Nolan said at the meeting
that despite what The Pitt
News or any other campus
organization says, at no time
was there any crime or
wrongdoing at the fraternity
house, and the university is

Faculty member challenges O'Connor

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

A Pitt faculty member said
she wants the chancellor to
stake his career on the
importance of the universi-
ty’s involvement in a tele-
scope project in Chile.

If Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor can say “‘this is
the single most important
priority in this university and

I stake my chancellorship on
it and if it fails, I fail also,”’
only then should Pitt invest
the required $8 million in the

project, said Maureen
McClure.
McClure made these

remarks Friday during the
Senate Budget Policies
Committee meeting, where
members also said that rec-
ommendations to spend only
1 percent of the university’s

total budget on maintenance,
is not enough.

O’Connor has said that
Pitt’s involvement in the
Magellan Project, the con-
struction of a six-and-a-half
meter telescope in Chile,
would make the university
more competitive. It would
give Pitt’s astronomers guar-
anteed telescope time that
would vault the university to

not taking sanctions against
the fraternity.

Boyd said more than one
fraternity was likely involved
in the assault, but the investi-
gation was halted by uncoop-
erative fraternity members.

“The fraternities were less
than cooperative in giving us
information." Boyd said.
“According-to the investigat-
ing officer who worked the
case. many questions were
not answered and many
phone calls were not
returned.”

assault

Senior Staff Writer

One in four women is sex-
ually assaulted. Many of
these assaults are never
reported, according to the co-
president of the Campus
Women’s Organization.

One Pitt student accused
several males of sexually
assaulting her at a fraternity
party on Sept. 10;

“We admire her courage to
come forward and to say that
this happened to her,” said
Stephanie Sudzina, co—presi—
“CWO is
going to be standing behind
this brave woman because
it’s wonderful that these
assaults are being reported.”

On campuses across the
country, “gang assaults are
taking place  and they tend
to take place more often in
fraternities and athletic
groups,” said Mary Koch
Ruiz, Pitt’s sexual assault
services coordinator.

From 1980 to 1990,55 per-
cent of gang rapes were com-
mitted by fraternity mem-
bers. 40 percent by members
of team sports and 5 percent
by men who didn’t belong to
any kind of organization.
according to “Sexual Assault
on Campus.” a book by
Carol Bohmer from Pitt and,
Andrea Parrot of Cornell.

According to Ruiz, the
book says gang rapes often
occur where males live
together and where alcohol

NEW YORK —— The U.N.
Security Council is demand-
ing that Iraq pull back
its elite troops from the
Kuwaiti border area and
barred any new threat to the
emirate.

The vote late Saturday night
on the U.S.-drafted resolution
was a unanimous 15-0. Russia
supported the measure after
U.S. officials agreed to some
amendments following a day

BONN, Germany —

Germany’s general election’

remained a cliffhanger to
the end on Sunday, with com-

a razor-thin majority victory
for Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s

German public broadcaster,
ARD, saw the race standing
at 48.9 percent for Kohl’s

an agreement with North

within the next few days.

Despite Christopher’s opti-

ended with no progress

Senior officials from North

unexpectedly resumed talks in

said the aim of U.S. negotia-

short of saying the Americans
hoped to disarm any existing

Imagine coming home from work and
finding your parents have locked you
out of your house and have left your
belongings outside. Or imagine your
father threatening to kill you.

Some members of the Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance can not only
imagine it, but have lived it.

The group held a meeting Wednesday
night for members to discuss their
experiences telling others about their
homosexuality, or have “come out.”
The discussion was held in recognition

of National Coming Out Day, a day for
gay people to “unite and make their
presence known, and through this unity
encourage others to come out,” said
Michelle Wirth, education chair of
BiGALA.

Most who took part in the discussion
said that telling their families was the
hardest part of the process, and some
said their parents reacted with anger.

Wirth said telling her parents she was
gay was very difficult. She said she
realized she was gay when she was
about 14 years old, but didn’t tell her
mother until she was 18. Her father was
outraged when he found out.

“My dad came home drunk one night,
because he’s an alcoholic, and he let

he didn’t have the guts to say when he
was sober. He said he wanted to kill
me, which wasn’t an idle threat. He car-
ries a gun every day and is a fourth-
degree black belt. This man wanted to
kill me because I’m gay. He’s my father
and he wanted to kill me."

Wirth said her father’s rage was so
severe she was going to call the police,
but found her sister on the phone,
already calling them. She discovered
later her father had been so loud in his
threats, 11 other families in her neigh-

Bill Gray, BiGALA’s business man-

about his own coming-out process. He
said he came out to a number of people
on campus, but tried to avoid telling his
parents.

“I went home for the summer think-I

proud to represent the universi-

Take Cavalla for the win

Bigelow lawn was decorated
in Hollywood Squares-style for
Pitt-Tac—Toe, sponsored by
PPC, which kicked off home-
coming week Wednesday.

Eight administrators includ-
ing Leon Haley, vice chancellor
for student and public affairs;
John DeVitto, associate vice
chancellor for business and
ﬁnance; and Joe Cavalla, direc-
tor of student activities,
answered multiple choice ques-
tions about the university. The
ninth position was filled by
Pitt’s mascot Roc, who only
answered true or false ques-
tions.

The administrators did not
merely answer questions: they
also joked around and playfully
harassed one another.

Two contestants competed
for a free spring break trip in
Panama Beach City.
Contestants were selected inter-
views that tested their knowl-

Hayes Davis won the game

Roll the keg

The Cathedral of Learning

Chancellor - J. Dennis

coach Ralph Willard and Haley

kicked off the event by rolling»

an empty keg across the finish
line with a broom.

Haley said he enjoys partici-
pating in activities like this,
because it brings the adminis-
trators and the students closer
together.

He added that if he had worn
his old clothes, he would have
competed in the egg toss. “I
used to be pretty good at it.”

Six teams of four competed
for three medals in single elim-
ination.

The obstacle course consist-
ed of rolling the empty keg,
shaving someone’s face with a
tongue depressor, an egg toss
and Dizzy Izzy.

Three teams representing Phi

the forefront of astrophysics
research.

The physics department
has also passed a resolution
stating the telescope project
is one of its high priorities.

But to invest in the project
“when millions of dollars
should be spent on cleaning
up classrooms for under-
grads, instead of sending it
off to Chile,  is [to me] the
height of irresponsibility,”
McClure said.

Pitt should “take care” of
undergrads in Oakland before
investing in the project in
Chile, she said.

O’Connor has committed
$1 million to refurbish class-
rooms every year, said
Phillip Wion, chair of the
Senate Budget Policies
Committee. J

But members of the com-
mittee said they did not
believe that the University
Planning and Budget
Committee’s recommenda-
tion to spend 1 percent of the
total budget on maintenance
would meet all of the univer-
sity’s needs, including the
need to refurbish classrooms.

Members agreed to write a
resolution expressing to the
UPBC that the amount of the
total budget spent should be
at least 4 to 6 percent.

If the university only
spends 1 percent of the total
budget on maintenance, it

would take a hundred years
to complete maintenance
projects that are needed now,
said committee member
Prem Prakash. L

“When you talk about com-
puters and labs, I cannot
believe that 1 percent would
even make a dent,” he said.

Maintenance needs also
include paving, lighting and
renovating varsity and intra-
mural sports facilities, Wion
said. “Pitt has deferred main-
tenance for so long, and the
longer it’s deferred, the more
serious the problems get.”

“Yeah, and [Pitt’s]
responding by sending
money for a telescope and
stadium,” McClure said. Pitt
plans to begin renovation on
stadium facilities in the next
five years.

In other business, some
committee members ques-
tioned the usefulness of the
university’s long-range acad-
emic plan. The academic
plan maps out the universi-
ty’s goals and suggestions for
improving various depart-
ments.

“But strategic planning
without budgeting is irrele-
vant,” McClure said.

In the next six months, the
university will translate the
academic plan into budget
decisions, Wion said.

The academic plan is full
of good ideas for the univer-
sity, but making these ideas a

reality will cost, so they
probably all won’t get done,
Dixit said.

The long-range plan
includes improving the
library system and “[creat—
ing] an annual fund for the
improvement of undergradu-
ate education,” among many
other suggestions.

These goals were listed in a
draft copy of “Toward the
21st Century — Missions,
Goals, Strategies and
Evaluation,” released by the
provost’s office.

The long-range academic
plan “is the product of the
first year of a three-year
planning exercise,” said Pitt
Provost James Maher in a
telephone interview.

“During the coming year,
 we will get into the details
of budgets and realistic
expectations,” he said.

The long-range plan will
be presented Oct. 21 at the
board of trustees meeting in
the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room. The meet-

ing will be open to the pub— I

lie.

In other business, Wion
announced that the chancel-
lor has formerly approved
the faculty pay raise that has
been in effect since it was
proposed to the Senate
Council a year ago.

Also, CGS has appointed
Saundra Yanchak as a student
member of the committee.

Sigma Chi.

Demming said he disagreed with Boyd on
cooperating with the investigation.

“My chapter provided complete coopera-
tion with the incident,” Demming said. “I
know that FIJI and Delta Tau Delta did as
well.’’

Greek Advisor Kerry Daley said that
she also fully cooperated with the
investigation by providing police with
full composites of the fraternity members.

Boyd said the composites were yearbook
pictures, and he added a guest log that is to
be kept was never received by Public Safety
because it was lost. ,

Daley said the fraternities were not
responsible for the guest log. ,

“It was not FIJI’s responsibility for the list.
The IFC’s social monitor misplaced it,”
Daley said.

Sexual Assault Services Coordinator Mary
Koch Ruiz said she is very concerned about
the allegations.

“I think that it’s frightening that the
fraternities can engage in this sort of
behavior,” Ruiz said.

serious, and based on those, some action
should be taken against the fraternity to
ensure that this does not happen again.”

Campus Women’s Organization Co-
President Stephanie Sudzina said if the alle-
gations are true, CWO expects a proper pun-
ishment.

“CWO backs that we will not allow this
kind of behavior on campus,” Sudzina said.

Through Public Safety’s investigation,
underage drinking allegedly took place at the
party, according to Haley. A

“Underagedrinking was also part of
the allegations in this particular incident,”
said Haley.

“Once it goes through the judicial process,
we are free to take sanctions.”

Boyd said he is not optimistic any arrests
will come soon, but the investigation is still
open.

“The investigation will remain an open
case file as long as it remains a possibility
that we can identify any persons responsi-
ble,” Boyd said. '

Koch said that during a discussion with a Freshman

fact that she was gay if she could.

“I couldn’t imagine who I’d be,” she said. “I don’t
know how I would act or be or look like if I wasn’t

Aristide returns to Haiti

Euphoria spread through Haiti on Saturday when Jean-Bertrand
Aristide finally came back from exile. This capped a historic 30
days with a U.S. invasion avoided at the last minute and a peace-
ful transfer of power.

A large chunk of credit for this must go to President Bill
Clinton. His perseverance through the ‘opposition of Congress and
the American public finally achieved what three years of sanc-
tions could not.

But this is not a fairy tale, and it is unlikely everyone will live
happily ever after. Three years ago, when Aristide was deposed,
Haiti was one of the poorest countries in the world, and three
years of economic sanctions and harsh military rule have only
made matters much worse. Haiti has about 70 percent unemploy-
ment, a chronic AIDS problem and the continued threat of vio-
lence by anti-Aristide factions after the U.S. forces leave.

Many people look to Aristide as a spiritual head of state. But
spiritualism will not put food on the table or give people jobs.
Haiti is in dire need of both internal reorganization and intema-
tional aid. A large chunk of that international aid should and will
likely come from the United States.

Some might object to our government spending our tax dollars
on a foreign country. But aid to Haiti is not a wholly humanitarian
measure. Haiti is well within our sphere of influence, and eco-
nomic prosperity in Haiti is beneficial to the U.S. economy. It is
in both our moral and economic interests to aid Haiti. Hopefully,
hard work and perseverance will lead Haiti out of misery.

Homecoming spirit

Pitt spirit is back! Well maybe.

The University of Pittsburgh student body was out in full force
this weekend for Homecoming activities. Both Midnight Madness
and the Homecoming football game against West Virginia had
strong, vocal crowds, both larger than last year’s respective
events. Other events were popular as well, and the fireworks
shook Pitt’s campus. The Pitt News applauds the students for pro-
viding such a lively weekend.

But we need to continue this spirit throughout the rest of the
year and beyond. Despite a 1-6 record, Johnny Majors has
brought excitement back to Pitt football and the promise of a win-
ning future. An active and excited student body can not only help
the team while on the ﬁeld, but can also help Majors in recruiting.
It certainly makes a difference to prospective college players
whether or not the student body is fully behind the team. It is hard
for Pitt to compete for top players when high school players see
empty seats at Pitt games, as opposed to packed screaming crowds
at Notre Dame, Ohio State and Penn State.

The same holds true for our basketball team. Though this may
be a long season with the injury to McCullough, new coach Ralph
Willard is bringing an exciting new playing style to Pittsburgh.

Let’s maintain the.spirit of Homecoming and bring back the
spirit of Pitt’s glory days.

OJ. trial is not merely a media circus

strange phenomenon
has been occurring all
. over the country.

People by the score are plead-
ing ignorance to all aspects of
an extremely important nation-
al issue. It’s even happening in
the universities, where pedants
normally are trying to prove
how much they know.

The issue in question, may it

please the court, is the trial of
Orenthal James Simpson. If
they thought you would not
brand them a total idiot, most
of the O.J. ignoramus crowd
would probably tell you that
they don’t even know who
O.J. Simpson is.
. Yet, aside from the fact that
court cases, especially those
involving celebrities, make a
great spectator sport, there are
a number of reasons why
America ought to tune into
this trial. It will have lasting
effects on the way cases are
tried, and it reﬂects on the way
our society is moving today.

The American legal system
(please note that it is not nec-
essarily a justice system)
works to a large degree on
precedent. These precedents

‘go back to English common

law, and some of thecases
were on the books before this
country was born. Precedents
can decide a case. O.J.
Simpson’s trial will set a num-
ber of precedents before it is
all over. They are already
starting to manifest themselves
in such areas as jury selection
and evidence handling.

In many ways this case is a
test of the jury system. It rais-
es a number of questions about
whether an unbiased jury can
be selected and how the courts
can go about selecting one.

This case is an experiment.
The selection process for
potential jurors will be rigor-
ous. These people must
answer a 75-page question-
naire which probes into all
aspects of their lives. The
questions" run the gamut from

“Do you own any special
knives (other than for cook-
ing), such as hunting or pen
knives?” to “Have you ever
felt sufficiently frustrated
within a domestic relationship
that you considered violence?”

According to The New York
Times, as of Oct. 1, 304 people‘
were in the pool of potential
jurors. That seems like a good
random sample of Southern
California. Perhaps sociolo-
gists ought to try to gain
access to that data and collate
it. It may reveal some interest-
ing things about that area.

The only obstacle in the way
of thisiis the same one which
faces Judge Lance Ito and the
attorneys who are to try this
case. This is thatthere are
some people with an agenda
who want to be on the jury.
One person biased in the
direction of the defense could
produce a hung jury. People
are trying to be as bland as
possible, despite having to
sign an oath, under the penalty
of perjury, promising to tell
the truth on these'question-
naires.

Police work will also come
under intense scrutiny. Should
detectives be allowed to enter
a private residence if they
think a life is endangered? The
answer is an obvious “yes,”
but other questions, such as
what criteria do they use to
determine this and what can
they do once they have entered
a dwelling are not so easy.

Science is playing a role in
the case as well. Is genetic evi-
dence admissible and reliable?
If this evidence can cause a
man to receive a death sen-
tence, some hard questions
must be asked about it.
Perhaps even more important
than whether or not it is accu-
rate is how the lawyers present
this evidence to a jury. The
jury’s role is to serve as a fact-
finding body, so their own
knowledge combined with the
information presented will

determine how this evidence
factors into the case.
Regardless, this case will
serve as a model of do’s and
don’ts for other cases all over
the country which involve sci-
entific evidence.

Those who don’t care about
the law or naivelyjbelieve that
they will never have to con-
front these issues in theirlives
have cause to pay attention to
this case as well.

The trial of O.J. Simpson
raises questions about our
society as a whole. One of the
really big questions concerns
heroes. What are heroes, and
how do we treat them when
they are no longer in the same
field as when they were per-
forming great feats? Does
scoring a touchdown 20 years
ago make O.J. Simpson less
culpable?

The prosecutors have decid-
ed not to seek the death penal-
ty. Some argue that this is to
make it easier to get a convic-
tion. Maybe hero status merits
special consideration, but what
is justice when dealing with
such a heinous crime?

Another important issue,
domestic violence, has been
thrust into the limelight at var-

ious times in connection with »

this case. If this is indeed a
case of domestic -violence,
then perhaps more will be
done to address a problem
which is all too often ignored.

These questions are reﬂec—
tive of the society, as are many
others raised by this case. Just
because tabloid coverage runs
high doesn’t mean this case is
all ﬂash and no substance.

So before you proudly apa-
thetic intellectuals leap to
change the channel the next
time you hear “O.J. Simpson,”
consider the source. Think
about what is really happen-
ing, and that update may have
much more meaning for you.

create excitement.”

Freshman Stacey Coplan said she came because she
watches the show and because “it’s fun to meet famous peo-
ple.”

“It’s always fun to come out oncollege campuses,” said
Haskell in a phone interview last week.

Purdee said in an earlier interview that being on campus
would make him feel young again and that he would just
hang out with “the young folks and talk a little about being in
the acting business.

He said he would answer speciﬁc questions about acting or
school. -

At the tailgate party, the cheerleaders performed, and the
Pitt marching band played the show’s theme. “That was real-
ly nice,” Haskell said.

Purdee said he felt alittle goofy and awkward when he
heard the theme, but it was fun.

Haskell said students were asking about storylines, but the
actors were sworn to secrecy.

Purdee, who used to play Nathan on “The Young and the
Restless,” said a lot of Y&R fans came up to talk to him.
“[Y&R] will follow me for life,” he said. -

The event was sponsored by the Athletic Department,
ABC—TV, Campus Dimensions, the Panhellenic Association
and the Interfratemity Council.’

Greek Advisor Kerry Daley said this activity provided the
Greek system with a way to get involved in the homecoming
activities.

Daley also said that having Haskell, whose storyline last
year dealt with gang rape, come would promote the preven-
tion of incidents of that sort and would promote sexual
assault issues. A

Haskell said she was open to talk about the rape storyline.
“It opened my eyes to how prevalent it was.”

She said the tailgate party might not be a place to mention
it, but she has received hundreds of letters about rape from
1 people who had no support system and no one else to talk to.

before the game. .

Columnist after trailing
Matt by 25 points.
Groff

Especially

against your archrival and clos-
est neighbor, with less than
minute left in the game, in front
of your biggest home crowd of
the season, during homecoming,
a weekend in which most Pitt
students haven’t yet seen their
football team win.

Unfortunately, not much in
the sports world is more painful
than having this all torn away
on a long pass with 24 seconds-
left.

And so it goes. Most of you
know the game to which I refer
is the roller coaster ride every
Pitt fan experienced in this
year’s Pitt-West Virginia game;
a game after which the Pitt play-
ers looked almost numb, still
shocked by the outcome and the
emotional extremes they had
experienced by game’s end. It .
was also a game which left Pitt
head coach Johnny Majors and
West Virginia head coach Don
Nehlen, both longtime veterans
of college football, shaking their
heads.

“Never have I seen a game as
crazy as that one,” Nehlen said.
“It was absolutely crazy.”

Majors said the play ranged
from ridiculous to outstanding,
with the Panthers falling victim
to Murphy’s Law more than
their fair share of the time.

“About the time you think
you’ve seen it all, you ﬁnd out
that you sure haven’t,” Majors
said.

If one thing is for sure-, how-
ever, it’s that this year’s version
of the Backyard Brawl did not
let anyone down in terms of
excitement and plays which
many people had not seen
before and may never see again.
Even though the game was ‘
characterized by poor execution
and sloppy plays, the Panthers
kept themselves in the game by
pulling off some unique plays
for which they deserve a lot of
credit.

Consider these facts:

Not often do you get to see a
defensive lineman rumble 53
yards for a touchdown on a spe-
cial teams play, yet that was
exactly what Tom Bamdt did
when Chad Askew got a hand
on a third quarter ﬁeld goal
attempt. Just as impressive was
Pitt’s gamble on an onside kick
after a third quarter touchdown,

end, Pitt and a homecoming
crowd of 38,293 were left to
lament over what could have
been as the Panthers fell to the
Mountaineers 47-41 in one of
the wildest games that anyone
has ever seen. '

“Never have I seen a game so
crazy,” WVU coach Don
Nehlen said.

That same phrase was on the
lips of the nearly 40,000 others
as they solemnly filed out of
Pitt Stadium not more than 30
painful seconds after
Mountaineer quarterback‘ Chad
Johnston hit flanker Zach
Abraham on a 60-yard touch-
down strike with 15 ticks left
on the clock that finally let the
Panthers rest in peace.

‘‘In 37 years of coaching, I

have seen about everything that
I could possibly see,” coach
Johnny Majors said. “Today, I
saw a game like I have never
been involved with in my life.”
The game featured ten plays
of over 40 yards, two blocked
field goals, a blocked punt, two
interceptions returned for
scores, a fake punt and a vari-

ety of fumbles and miscues. I

The two teams combined for
983 yards in total offense.

“There were so many mis-
takes out there today that it
would take two-football fields
to write it all down,” Nehlen
said.

But as the" smoke cleared
with _38 seconds left, it looked
like the Panthers had signed,
sealed and delivered a win to a
homecoming crowd that was as
loud and as boisterous as any
has been in the last few years.

John Ryan, who replaced an
ineffective Sean Fitzgerald and
threw for 433 yards and four
touchdowns, worked the two
minute drill to perfection and
engineered a six—play, 80-yard
scoring drive in 54 seconds.

WR Dietrich J ells caught 5 passes for 220 yards and two TDs.

The drive was highlighted by
a 16-yard QB draw by Ryan.
He capped the march by hitting
Chad Askew on a five—yard
touchdown pass that left Pitt
down 40-39.

Pitt called timeout immedi-
ately after the score, but there
never seemed to be any doubt
as to what Majors would do.

The madness at midnight continues

By Matt Groff
Senior Staff Writer

More than 4,000 Pitt fans
packed the lower levels of
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse on
Friday to get their first
glimpse of the Pitt basketball
teams this season. From their
reactions, they seemed to be
hopeful with what they saw.

“Both th women’s and
men’s teams looked better
than I expected,” Pitt student
Rhonda Barron said.
“Hopefully, they’1l win more
games than most people think
they will.”

Pitt’s annual Midnight
Madness is quickly gaining
popularity as a new tradition
here, as it is around the coun-
try. Crowds as big as 20,000
have turned out to support
their team at the stroke of
midnight on the first day of
the college basketball season.

On Friday, Pitt fans seemed
to want‘ to find out the
answers to their questions
more than anything else. With
the departure of men’s head
coach Paul Evans, newcomer
Ralph Willard brings high
expectations to Pitt fans, and
so far, not many players.

“I understand this year will
be shaky, considering Willard
is new and all,” Pitt student
Ryan Babico said. “He does
seem to be making progress
in recruiting, but I want to see
some wins this year.”

Standing in Willard’s way,
of course, are major losses
from last year including cen-
ter Eric Mobley, now with the
Milwaukee Bucks, and Jerry

to make the game close,” center
Lawson Mollica said. “I think
that in our position we will
always go for the win.”

Majors felt the same way as
Pitt lined up with four
receivers. The decay worked.
As, Ryan barreled across the
right side for the conversion,

McCullough to a knee injury.
But when the clock struck
midnight on Friday, any prob-
lems for the Pitt basketball
teams were forgotten and stu-
dents gave thunderous
applause to the men’s and

women’s teams, a hopeful -

send-off for a successful sea-
son.

Willard promised the crowd
an exciting season.

“We will be doing a lot of
running and shooting, having
fun out there,” Willard said.
“We’ll be a fun team to
watch.”

Women’s basketball head
coach Kirk Bruce said he’d
like to see more people come
out and support the Lady
Panthers.

Following player introduc-
tions, the women’s team
played a split-squad scrim-
mage, followed by the men’s
slam dunk contest and men’s
scrimmage.

Judging from the crowd’s
response, Chad Varga, a
junior college transfer,
seemed to be the biggest sur-
prise of the night with his
baseline windmill dunk in the
slam dunk contest and later a
dunk over two of his kneeling
teammates, sending the field-
house crowd into a frenzy.
Junior Garrick Thomas. how-
ever, topped Varga’s feat by
dunking over three people,
arguably the best dunk of the
night. -.

The Pitt soccer team (6-6
overall, 1-5 in the Big East
conference) received another
blow to its minimal playoff
chances as the University of
Connecticut (9-2, 3-1), which
is off to its best start since its
National Championship sea-
son of 1981, defeated the
Panthers 1-0 on Friday night.

As Pitt celebrated home-
coming, there were no fire-
works at Pitt Stadium. The
only highlight of the game
was a UConn goal by sopho-
more Steve Chirgwin with 32
minutes left in the game.
Chirgwin now has 19 goals in
his short collegiate career.
Freshman Bobby Rhine assist-
ed on the goal for the Huskies,
who are tied for third place in
the Big East conference.

“It was disappointing
because it was one of the bet-
ter games we played all year,”
senior Eric Prex said. “We had
no luck this game and all
year.”

The first half remained
scoreless as both teams
volleyed back and forth, up
and down the field. Panther
goalie Kirk Brodows (4-5) and
Husky goalie Sloan Spaeth (8-
2), denied all chances for any
goals.

The second half started with

Backup QB

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

Don’t blame John Ryan.

The junior quarterback was
given the responsibility of bringing
to life what had become a desolate
offense under starter Sean
Fitzgerald, and considering the
mess he had to try and piece
together, he did an admirable job.

“For not playing very much, he
did a good job of ﬁghting back and
being competitive,” head coach
Johnny Majors said. “He certainly
made a lot of big plays.”

It was a big play for West
Virginia that greeted Ryan’s return
at quarterback. On his first snap at
9:16 of the second quarter, he
threw an interception to Aaron
Beasely who ran 50 yards for a
touchdown. At that point -WVU
was leading 24-6.

Ryan checked into the game
after Fitzgerald failed to move the
offense.

From the opening snap,
Fitzgerald was having his prob-
lems. In an attempt to execute a
pitch to Dietrich Jells. he was
sacked by WVU defensive ends
Steven Perkins and Canute Curtis.
The Panthers subsequently lost 11
yards on the play, and it would be
one of many plays that pushed the
Panthers back for negative
yardage.

Consequently, it only took
Majors a quarter and a half to insert
Ryan in hopes of providing some
momentum for his offense.

“We decided to make a change,
and I think that it certainly added
rejuvenation to our offense at that
particular time,” Majors said.

Starting off on shaky ground,
Ryan was able to put points on the
board, but he struggled in the first
half, throwing a costly interception.
He was intercepted twice in the
second half, but more importantly
he helped the Panthers take the
lead late in the ball game and ﬁn-
ished with four touchdown passes.

“The offense was in some good
positions. but I ended up shooting
myself in the foot a couple of
times.” Ryan said. “It’s real frus-
trating.”

The loss may have been frustrat-
ing for Ryan. but his statistics for
this game match the best of his
career. His 433 yards passing
almost surpassed the all—time
record held by John Congemi. who
threw for 446 yards against Navy
in I986.

“The glaring mistakes were the
two interceptions, [they proved to
be] major factors in the game,”
Majors said.

Yet. the Pitt head coach will A

admit that it was Ryan who helped
turn the game around for his club.

“[It was] the last two touch-
downs that put us back in the
game,” Majors said.

The touchdown drive that put
Pitt ahead of WVU, for what all
figured to be the end of the game,
began at the Panthers’ own 20-yard

_ line.

Six plays, 80 yards and 54 sec-
onds later. Ryan had engineered a
drive that was capped off by a 5-
yard touchdown pass to Chad
Askew. which placed the Panthers
one point behind the Mountaineers.
40-39.

Majors and his braintrust met and
decided to go for the win with an
I attempt at a two-point conversion
with 41 seconds left in the game.

In what looked to be an option
play, Ryan kept the ball and lunged
across the goal line for two points
and the lead.

“It was a walk-in basically,”

Ryan said. “They had a 10-man

line, and our lead back took [the
11th man] out of the play.”

Seemingly the hero, Ryan
returned to the Pitt sideline as the
messiah who had delivered salva-
tion. He had led his team to a his-
toric upset that concluded as a mas-
terful come-from-behind-win.

“It doesn’t matter how many
mistakes we make, we just want to
go out and win the game.” Ryan
said. “To come out on the wrong
side of it is real tough.”

Yet for Ryan, who finished with
433 total yards passing after com-
pleting 20 of 37 attempts. the
bewildered quarterback almost
pulled off a win that might well
have turned the season around for
the Panthers.

Pitt volleyball team continues dominance

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor’

The Big East freight train con-
tinues to roll.

Still undefeated in conference
play (5-0), the Pitt Lady Panthers
volleyball team squashed
Syracuse and St. John’s on the
road this weekend, winning six
out of seven games.

B u t
compared
to last
w e e k -
end’s per-
f o r -
m a n c e s
when Pitt
crushed
Providence and Seton Hall, the
play could have been better.

l“It was not a sharp weekend,
but we’ll take the win,” head

 

coach Cindy Alvear said. “I’m
not disappointed and I’m not
thrilled. I am pleased to win six
games and lose one.”

On Saturday, the Lady Panthers
beat Syracuse in four games by
the scores of 15-7, 11-15, 15-8,
15-7.

Pitt continued to ride the play
of last week’s Big East Player of
the Week Sarah Mikla, who
cashed in another award—winning
performance. She was second on
the team with 15 kills against the
Orangewomen and had a .406 hit-
ting percentage in 32 attempts.
Not to mention Mikla’s eight digs
and three blocks.

“Sarah Mikla is lighting up the
stats right now,” Alvear said.

Sara Mitchell led the Pitt offen-
sive and defensive attack with 20
kills and 16 digs.

choreographed the Pitt offensive
outburst with 48 assists. She also
had six digs and three serving
aces. Carrie Thornton added 13
kills and 13 digs in the win.

Collectively, the Lady Panthers
beat Syracuse in every facet of
the game. The most notable dif-
ference was the two teams’ hit-
ting percentages. Pitt’s team .248
hitting percentage outdid the
Orange’s hitting percentage by
.110, as they hit a lowly .138.
Contributing to the
Orangewomen’s woes was their
zero hitting percentage in game
one. In that game Syracuse had 11
kills with 11 errors.

On Sunday against the St.
John’s Red Storm, a team that is
entering its ﬁrst season of volley-
ball competition, Pitt swept them
in three straight, but unusually
close games. Despite the Red

Storm having eight freshmen on
their roster, Pitt cou1dn’t blow
them away. The scores were 15-7,
16-14,15-12.

In what was supposed to be the
year that the Lady Panthers would
finally fall from their Big East
throne, Pitt has taken on the con-
ference with a vengeance. But
according to Alvear, Pitt’s moti-

‘vation doesn’t form from the

naysayers’ words.

“Our focus is on internal
things,” Alvear said. “We want
each individual to see themselves
as a contributor, not as a role
player. We’re working on believ-
ing in ourselves.”

The Lady Panthers will play
West Virginia at the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse on Friday at 7:30.
Then Pitt will play another home
game against George Washington
at 1 p.m. on Saturday. ’

and UConn could muster only
seven. Fouls, however, were
abundant. The Huskies com-
mitted 23 and the Panthers
were nabbed for 15. Pitt’s
Bobby Dyer and UConn’s
Rhine each received yellow
cards during the game.

The Pitt defense held
Connecticut’s top scorer Eric
Barbieri to only three shots,
and the Husky defense
allowed Prex just one shot on
goal. Barbieri leads the Big
East in scoring with 12 goals
and three assists, and is
ranked fifth nationally in
Division I scoring.

Brodows had five saves on
the night while Spaeth, who
improved his career record to
29-21-4, had six saves.

“UConn is a very good
team,” Prex said. “Next to
Georgetown, they are the best
team that we have played this
year.” '

Prex still‘leads the team in
total points with 21 (7 goals, 7
assists). Dean Astorino (10
points, 3, 4), Knut Saeter (9,
4, 1) and Jeff Porter (9, 3, 3)
trail Prex in the scoring ranks.

With only two Big East con-
ference games left on the
schedule for the Panthers,
their playoff hopes are dwin-
dling. .

“Our chances of playoffs
are realistically not there,”
Prex said. “St. John’s is a
good team, and we’d like to
knock them off, and the Penn
State game will be big
because they didn’t want to
play us for so long until this
year. So there is still some-
thing to play for this season.”

Stadium. The Panthers took
what looked to be a safe lead
with less than a minute left. But
then came Johnston’s heroics,
and a bitter defeat for Pitt,
which fell to 1-6.

“It was the best feeling,”
Ryan said. “But just seeing
them score, to go from so high,
it was like the lowest point of
the season.”

’ Mollica shared Ryan’s senti-
ments but also took into consid-
eration how the game had been
going to that point.

“I never really cashed it in,”
Mollica said. “When there are
ticks on the clock left, its still
up for grabs. It’s just tough to
go from such a level of exhila-
ration to complete devastation
in 30 seconds. I’m still in
shock.”

Pitt looked like it was in
shock in the first half as the
Mountaineers jumped out to a
31-6 lead in the second quarter.

WVU scored on the first
drive of the game on a 41-yard
field goal by Bryan Bauman.
On Pitt’s first possession,
Fitzgerald drove the Panthers
into field goal range but David
Merrick’s 41-yard attempt was
blocked by Steven Perkins and
picked up by defensive back
Harold Kidd, who raced 60
yards down the right sideline
for the score. The blocked kick
return made the score 10-0.

West Virginia made the next
blunder when Rahsaan
Vanterpool fumbled the kick off
and Eric Kasperowicz recov-
ered. Billy West, who had a
rough day with 48 yards on 17
carries, rumbled in from the 2-
yard line for Pitt’s first score.

Merrick missed the point
after, and on WVU’s next pos-
session Johnston hooked up
with Abraham on a 40-yard
bomb that left Pitt down 17-6 at
the end of the ﬁrst quarter.

In the second quarter, Majors
brought in last year’s starter,
Ryan. Majors said he made the
move to rejuvenate the team. It
initially looked to be a critical
mistake as Ryan’s first pass was
thrown directly to cornerback
Aaron Beasley who returned
the pick 50 yards for a touch-
down, making the score 24-6.

On the next possession, Pitt
punted and N ehlen reached into
his bag of tricks and burned the
Panthers on another long throw.
Johnston executed a beautiful
fake reverse that fooled every-
one, including Panther corner-
back Maurice Williams, who
lost track of Vanterpool and let
him run for a 46-yard touch-
down.

Johnston had a career day as
he torched the Pitt secondary
for a career-high 396 yards and
four touchdowns.

Ryan, who also had a career
day, answered by tossing an 80-
yard strike to Dietrich Jells.

. Beasley made a play on the ball

but missed. Jells caught the ball
in stride for Pitt’s longest play
from scrimmage of the year.
But Ryan threw the 2-point
conversion try into the hands of
linebacker Matt Taffioni, who
ran 100 yards down the left

 

 

sideline for two points.

The next time Pitt got the
ball, Ryan bounced back from
the miscue and led the Panthers
on an eight-play, 80-yard drive
that culminated with a 34-yard
strike to Billy Davis. The
Panthers ended the half down
33-19.

Ryan hooked up with Jells
again in the second half on a
high lob that Jells ran under for
a 63-yard score. Jells, whose
big day was lost in the defeat,
caught five balls for 225 yards
and two TD’s.

The Pitt special teams then
demonstrated their full arsenal
with mixed results. They recov-
ered an onside kick, then
attempted a fake punt for no
gain and finally a blocked field
goal that Tom Bamdt returned
53 yards for a touchdown to
knot the game at 33-33.

Intertwined within that whole
conglomeration were two inter-
ceptions by Ryan; fumbles by
Pitt’s Denorse Mosley and Billy
West; Davis blocking a punt by

The activities for students
began much earlier in the
night, as the events kicked off
at 10:30 with the the women’s
and men’s basketball alumni
beating the the Pitt student
All-Stars in their respective
games.

It was followed by a
celebrity free throw contest in
which Steelers Eric Green and
Ernie Mills, along with Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, battled members
of the audience.

A number of brave souls
took part in the Dick Vitale
impersonation contest as they
took turns trying to sound like
the colorful ESPN commenta-
tor. _

The Izzy Dizzy featured
disoriented Greeks rolling
around, falling all over the
place and generally making
fools of themselves as they
tried to make lay ups after
running around a baseball bat
twelve times.

The Panther Paul contest

        
   
     
   

   
 
 
 
 
 
   

  

featured a mob of people on
the court break dancing,
jumping like frogs and franti-
cally running around in an
attempt to look like the field-
house favorite.

This was followed by

Shooting for Dollars, a con-
test that offered various
amounts of money for certain
shots. The only problem was
that nobody made a shot. A
young man who blew a lay up
for $25 and a young woman
who missed two $200 free
throw shots felt the crushing
blows.

The mysterious Fieldhouse
Phantom also showed up on

the scene with a contest to
find a hidden basketball.
Different clues will be
released during home games
leading to the location of the
ball. The winner will receive
a trip to New York to see
“The Phantom of the Opera.”

But the real stars of the
evening were the players,
who have now been formally
introduced and are preparing
for the upcoming season.

The Lady Panthers play an
exhibition game on
November 19 against the
Lithuanian National Team
and move on to the University
of Nevada-Las Vegas
Tournament. Their first home
game is December 4 against
Penn State.

The Pitt men’s team plays
exhibition games November
15 and 22, against Marathon
Oil and Moscow /Spartak,
respectively. They begin their
season with a Nov. 29
matchup at North Carolina,
and their home opener will be
on Dec. 3 against Buffalo.

WVU’s Todd Sauerbrum, who
had never been blocked in his
career dating back to high
school and a 32-yard field goal
attempt by Merrick, which was
also blocked.

“We have the worst
protection of field goals that I
have had in 37 years of coach-

' ing,” Majors said in reference

to the two that were blocked on

the day.
With 5-8 seconds left,
Johnston hit Vanterpool,

who outran David Sumner
and Mosely, for 81 yards down
the middle of the field which
gave WVU a 40-33 lead.

The loss was particularly
disappointing for the Panthers,
who have found themselves
on the short end of a number
of close games this season.

“There were a lot of
guys fighting hard out
there,” Mollica said. “That’s
our third loss in a close game.
We’re 0-3 in the tight ones.
and that’s just not going to do
it.”

The Pitt News, Monday, October 17, 1994

Column

°From page 10

during a 27-2 Pitt run. The kick,
which was recovered by kicker
Todd Barton, made the Panthers
look unstoppable and sent Pitt
fans into a frenzy.

Also consider Pitt’s block of
Mountaineer punter Todd
Sauerbrum, who led the country
in kicking going into Saturday’s
game. Sauerbrum, a senior, said

, he had never been blocked in

college or high school before
Pitt. In fact, a major factor in the
game was the duel between
Sauerbrum and Pitt punter Nate
Cochran, where Cochran proved
he can hang with the nation’s
best. Cochran finished with a
46.5 average to Sauerbrum’s
47.5. Although Cochran didn’t
have any punts blocked, he did
participate on a fake punt
attempt which was squelched by
West Virginia.

In another surprising effort,
replacement quarterback John
Ryan seemed to win back the
hearts of Pitt fans after leading
off his homecoming stint with a
pass intercepted for a touch-

down. From there, he passed for
433 yards and four touchdowns,
including 80- and 63-yard touch-
downs to receiver Dietrich J ells.
In addition, he scored the go-
ahead two-point conversion on
an option play. His performance
will likely reopen the quarter-
back controversy for next week’s
game at Virginia Tech.

Of course, not all of the rare
highlights were on Pitt’s side of
the ball. West Virginia cashed in
on several fumbles and special
teams miscues for some big
gains. Not to mention a 100-yard
return on a Pitt two-point con-
version attempt in the second
quarter or the season-high pass-
ing marlcs Mountaineer quarter-
back Chad Johnston kept setting
in an explosive first half.

The Backyard Brawl more
than delivered when it came to
excitement, but the result left Pitt
fans hoping the Panthers can
sacriﬁce some of the craziness
next year and get a nice, boring
win.
