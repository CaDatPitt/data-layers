UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Gallaudet

appoints

first deaf president

By Paul Page

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —— Gallaudet
University's campus opened
Monday after a week of turmoil
with the first deaf president in its
124-year history, proclaiming the
school is ”off and running.”

Irving King Jordan Jr. was greet-
ed with a standing ovation by stu-
dents at a press conference called
on campus to introduce him and
new board Qf trustees chairman
Philip Bravin.

lordan, Bravin and the stu-
dents, whose seven days of pro-
tests for a ”Deaf President Now”
drew national attention to their
movement, said their success is
the beginning of new gains for
the hearing impaired.

”People will look at us and
study what we are doing," said
Jordan, a Callaudet graduate.

”We will prove to them, not
only can they choose a deaf presi-
dent and chairman, but that these
two will succeed,” he said.

”People will not now believe
it is impossible for deaf people to
succeed. Deaf people can do

anything hearing people can do
except hear,” Jordan said to
cheers of students who waved
their hands in the air.

"The campus is off and run-
ning, and we are back in busi-
ness, and the university is back in
business,” Jordan told cheering
students.

Jordan, 44, lost his hearing at
age 20 in a motorcycle accident.
He speaks clearly but also uses
sign language when he talks.

Jordan and Bravin were joined
at the packed press conference by
student body president Greg Hli-
bok, one of the campus leaders
during a week in which the stu-
dent shut down the campus in
protest over the hiring of
Elisabeth Ann Zinser, a hearing
woman, as president.

Zinser resigned late Thursday.

"We're back in business and
back to business, but Gallaudet
will never again be what it used
to be," said Hlibok, who spoke
in sign language and through an
interpreter.

There were only a few students
on campus Monday, the first day

give him our full support."

Jordan at first showed sympa-
thy toward the protesters and
then sided with former trustees
chairwoman Jane Bassett
Spillman and Zinser.

He publicly abandoned the
university administration a day
later, last Thursday.

’’I could never have guessed in
a million years that it would be-

said of the protests.

Pitt student organizes
creative writing group

By Lisa Molinaro
Staff Writer

Student fiction and poetry
writers will finally have the op-
portunity to show and discuss
their material with other students
tonight, as part of a series of
weekly meetings in an effort to
organize a new student group for
writers.

Currently, a group for under-
graduate writers doesn't exist at
Pitt. ”l think there should be one
so I decided to initiate this,” said
lay Katz, an undergraduate En-
glish writing major. ”They have
a magazine [featuring fiction and
poetry written by students] at Car-
negie Mellon that's put out by the
students.

”Eventually, I want to be recog-
nized and funded [by the univer-
sity], but for now, it's an
unofficial group,” Katz added.
”We really don't need all that
much funding. We just need a
place to meet and a commitment
from these people.”

Katz said he wants to organize
writing students with similar in-
terests into groups of five or six
so that they can "get to know
each other and become familiar
with each others’ writing styles."

Within the framework of these

groups, Katz believes the people
will be able to spend more time
critiquing each other's work than
they could in a writing class be-
cause of the smaller number of
people involved. Katz also said
he wants to get writers together
to see what their interests are and
”provide feedback and tips."

According to Katz, the meet-
ings will be similar in format to
the writing workshop classes
offered by the English depart-
ment. However, he said that stu-
dents will get more personal
attention at the meetings.

"I'm sure there are a lot of fic-
tion and poetry writers [at Pitt]
who are looking for a group like
this, and therefore, I feel this
group will be a success. The main
necessity is getting the committ-
ment from the members of the
group to show up,” Katz said.

While the meetings are work-
shops, Katz plans to alternate
workshops with guest speakers
when possible. He plans to ask
Pitt and CMU professors, as well
as professional writers, to speak
at meetings.

Katz said that students are in-
terested in a professor's writing
style but ”usually, in class, a
professor can't discuss his or her

Gorbachev woos Yugoslavia with ’Glasnost’

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -
Mikhail Gorbachev was informal
and good-natured Monday on the
first day of his visit to a com-
munist country that has tried,
with mixed results, some of the
economic reforms he supports.

The Soviet leader made an
unscheduled stop in a busy
downtown square and left his ar-
mored limousine to shake hands
and chat briefly with pedestrians.
A witness said he picked up a
child and kissed it.

A similar stop on a Washington
street in December, with Vice
President George Bush, created a
mild sensation. On Monday,
however, few reporters or pho-
tographers were with Gorbachev,
and even those traveling with the
official party had been taken on
to the next scheduled stop.

Gorbachev’s wife, Raisa, also
engaged citizens in conversation
as she arrived at the Peoples’
Museum for a tour at the begin-
ning of the fiveday official visit.

Late in the day, after visiting
memorials and monuments, the
chief of the Soviet Communist
Party began talks with President

Lazar Mojsov and Bosko Krunic,
head of the Yugoslav party.

During their tour, the Gor-
bachevs placed a wreath at the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
atop Mount Avala, just outside
Belgrade.

Committee:Iet drivers
decide on CAT fund

HARRISBURG — Participation
in the Catastrophic Loss Trust
Fund program would be volun-
tary under legislation approved
Monday by the House Appropri-
ations Committee.

The legislation, which now
goes to the full House, was
amended into a Senate bill by
state Rep. William Lloyd, D-
Somerset.

Lloyd said motorists who want-
ed to continue in the program
would pay an annual fee, which
would be set by the CAT Fund
board and based on the number
of participants.

Under current law, owners of
all vehicles registered in the state
must participate in the program,
which pays major medical costs
for persons injured in accidents.

NEWS BRIEFS

ASSOCIATED PRESS

The fee is $8 but is earmarked to
increase to $24 a year in
October.

The Insurance Department has
also recommended that each ve-
hicle owner pay $6 a year for 10
years to cover the program's un-
funded liability. Lloyd said his
legislation would allow the
General Assembly to decide how
the unfunded liability should be
handled after studying a report
from the Insurance Department.

LORETTO, Pa. -- Al Benedict,

bill for her late son's liver trans-
plants, the woman’s attorney
said.

Allegheny County Judge Ralph
Cappy granted, however, a re-
quest for additional time to file
preliminary objections to the
lawsuit, said the attorney, David
Jones, of Pittsburgh.

”The time they should have
been filed was back in Dece —
ber, but Mrs. DeSillers didn't
have a lawyer then,” Jones said.

The court granted 20 days for
the objections, he said.

’’I still do not believe it has
jurisdiction, but you can raise
jurisdiction at any time, and I'll
raise it later,” Jones said.

Ronnie DeSillers died last April
awaiting his fourth liver trans-
plant. Only about $161,000 has
been paid toward charges total-
ing $423,000, according to the
hospital.

Mrs. DeSillers later sued thé'3

of care her son received.

love that.”

White, a native of Pittsburgh,
said he started playing pool when
he was eight. He was influenced
mainly by his world champion
uncle, William Clearwater, and
his father. White also added that
his grandfather made billiard
balls in a shop on Fifth Avenue.

White said he started his bil-
liard career ”hustling” pool. He

claims he got out of tournaments,-

and into touring because ”you
can play only so long for money
then you have to get a job or do
this," said White.

He also added, ’’I don't like
|abor."

After Mehta played White dur-
ing the second show, Mehta said,
”It was an experience. I really
respect his pool shooting.”

Thien Nguijen, a Pitt senior,
said he ”mostly went for his
[White's] personality. He's funny;
he knows how to relate to the
students.”

”He’s very cocky," said Mark
Hart, a freshmen at Pitt. ”He has
every right to be; he's that good.”

Hart also added "it wasn't the
shots that impressed me, it was
the control he had of the cue
ball.”

J.R. Calvert, the region four
champion of the ACUI, said
"He's just like us. He's great at
convincing you of the mystique
of playing pool. He's a great
showman and really grabs the au-
dience."

own work because they're teach-
ing, and the main focus of the

class is the student's work.”

Patricia Dobler, a member of
Pitt's English Writing department,
said the idea of this group is an
appealing prospect for beginning
writers.

”The more students get
together and become involved on
their own with writing, the bet-
ter writers they'll be. I'm very ex-
cited by it. It's a terrific idea," she
said. ”I think it's one expression
of the various kinds of interest in
creative writing on this campus.
It's a healthy sign.”

The first meeting is scheduled
at 8:30 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room.

'Four letter words

in the campaigning

The number of four-letter words in the presidential field
dropped dramatically over the past week. In a flurry of voter
apathy, Gary Hart and Jack Kemp reached for their hats and

went about their careers.

For Kemp, the resignation was hardly a surprise. Since the
beginning of the campaign, his support and even his name
recognition across the country has been minimal at best. He
was forced to stand in the shadow of Bush's alleged reputa-
tion, Robertson's inflammatory comments and Dole’s charis-
ma. For his efforts, he may yet find himself called to duty at
the national convention in New Orleans.

Gary Hart's story, however, is nearly a negative of Kemp's.
Where Kemp had name recognition problems, Hart's name was

known a little too well.

After the Bimini affair, and after Hart's resignation from the
race, there was speculation that Hart's political future had been
decimated. Hart, since his days managing the McGovern cam-
paign though, has refused to play by the unwritten political rules

of etiquette.

He blamed his downfall on the press. As a candidate, he was

I dependent on the press to inform the masses of his positions.

The press, seeming to take affront, refused, as is their right, to
devote much space to Hart as a candidate. Hart as a spectacle

sold more advertising.

And so, we are left with Bush, Dole and Gore. Enough four-

Ietter words by any standard.

Looking for the problems

Pressure. Anxiety. A sense of
impending doom. Sit back and
hum a few bars of the end-of-the-
world blues.

Dark days are a’ comin’; Bush
is White House bound. Just when
things were looking up -— our in-
trepid leader was on his way out,
the CIA was being watched, the
weather was getting warmer —
the bottom fell out.

I can't really put my finger on
it, but there is something very
wrong in the wind. All the stand-
bys have gone by the wayside.
Baseball games don't draw well
anymore. Apple pie has been
linked to cancer. Chevys are be-
ing re—called. The American
dream has had its clothes ripped
off, and public nudity is a feder-
al sin. Our moral sensibilities‘are
raped on the evening news. We
go back for more each day.

Our attorney general, the
highest (there are jokes here

MATTHEW
THORNTON

about Noriega I don't want to get
into) law enforcement officer in
the country, has been investigat-
ed more often than any of his
predecessors. Ketchup is a
vegetable in our public schools,
this from an expert in such things.

The wind blows a little colder,
a little more foul.

Before we understood it, the
sun was a god. As we realized the
error of our reasoning, we moved
our gods farther from our ex-
perience. On TV, we can ex-
perience, albeit vicariously,
anything. Our money affirms our
trust in God. God's love can be
purchased with that same curren-
cy. Ask Pat Robertson.

There is money to be made in
pursuit of happiness. In providing
for the common defense, the
motivator is profit. We have ex-
changed our freedoms for the
chance to make more money.
Fundamentalism is a reaction, but
nobody can identify the irritant.

If the path to peace led to a
comfortable bottom line, our
generation would never have
known war. The biggest item in
the operating budget for the land
of the free is the killing of hu-
mans. Most of the research, the
nominally objective pursuit of
knowledge for its own sake, done
in America is directed by profes-

sional and sanctioned, even glori— J

fled, murderers.

The wind stinks, and there
seems to be nowhere to hide.’

Oh beautiful, for spacious
skies

Suffering from an AIDS information overdose

Are you a member of a high-

Orisk group for exposure to mixed

or misinformation? Have you had
visual or auditory contact with a
self-proclaimed AIDS expert?
Casual? Intimate? Repeated?

If so, by now you may be ex-
hibiting all the symptoms of
AIDS-information whipsaw. High
Anxiety. Confusion. Cynicism. A
desire to put a bag over your
head until it all goes away.

The fear of the AIDS epidemic
has spread so much faster than
our knowledge of the disease that
it's spawning whole cottage in-
dustries of ”experts,” with their
varying credentials and agendas,
all advising the public on their
sexual behavior. Some have been
manufacturing alarms, and others
have been peddling reassurance.
The results are bewilderment and
a building consumer resistance to
any information.

In the past month, we had Dr.
Robert Could, a psychiatrist, tell-
ing That Cosmo Girl in her
favorite magazine that there was
virtually nothing to worry about
from normal heterosexual rela-
tionships, beyond a broken heart.

~...~

There wasn't evidence that the fa-
tal disease was ”breaking out."

Now we have the psycholo-
gists of the sexual revolution, Dr.
William Masters and Virginia
Johnson along with Dr. Robert
Kolodny, insisting in a book
called Crisis that AIDS is ”now
running rampant in the heter-
osexual community.”

Masters, Johnson and Kolodny
studied 800 heterosexuals be-
tween ages 21 and 40 from four
cities. Half of them were
monogamous, and half of them
had had more than six partners in
the past year. Of those multiple
partners, 7 percent of the wom-
en and 5 percent of the men test-
ed positive for AIDS —— a number
far higher than any other study.

Armed with these numbers,
they accuse the scientific com-
munity of ”benevolent decep-
tion.” The Center for Disease
Control estimates 1.5 million
Americans are infected. This trio
doubles that estimate. They say
that 200,000 non—drug-using het-
erosexuals are probably infected,
a number seven times higher than
the one given by the CDC. ‘

Are you developing an immuni
ty to AIDS statistics? ”The public
has had an excess of assurance
followed by an excess of alarm
from so-called experts on both
sides,” says Dr. Harvey Fineberg,
dean of Harvard's School of Pub-
lic Health and one of those try-
ing to maintain some sort of
balance.

We get tossed between such
scientific extremes in part be-
cause we don’t have satisfying
data, but we do have a lot of fear.
Anybody can play with the prob-

abilities until they match their

, “‘y,_'..'.

own anxieties. It's been estimat-
ed, for example, that the risk of
transmitting the virus through one
act of vaginal intercourse is one
in a thousand. Is that a lot or a lit-
tle? Over an evening, a year or a
lifetime?

The triowho wrote Crisis esti-
mates that the risk for a woman
is one in 400 sexual encounters.
Does this signify a disease run-
ning ”rampant”? When asked
why she called it that, Masters
said, ”I simply believe it.”

Crisis even raises the flame on
”casua|" contact, saying that it's
theoretically possible to get in-
fected in a touch football game or
from a toilet seat. As Fineberg
said, ”It’s theoretically possible
that a meteorite could hit the
World Trade Center.”

If epidemiologists were forced
to choose between the alarmists
and soothing-sayers, they would
reluctantly choose alarmists. "But
my fear,” said Dean Fineberg, ”is
that the public will say nobody
knows anything; it feeds into the

anti-expert mood. They don't»

want to hear anymore.”

There are many reasons for the
zDI‘VIQ|V'I\v*+"‘rO'*~'iCI ops -.~‘

dueling experts. They range from
honest scientific differences to
hustles. But the public is interest-
ed in one thing: How scared
should I be? How careful should
I be? And there is a certain con-
stancy underlying all but the most
irresponsibly rosy scenarios
about how to behave sexually in
this epidemic.

Crisis offers the chilling notion
that only 10 percent of their sam-
ple with numerous sex partners
thought they were at risk. None
of them were regular condom
users.

In the face of all this, the
prescription is the same one we
heard last month, last year, the
year before. Abstinence or a
monogamous relationship with
an uninfected person is the best
protection. The use of a condom
and a spermicide every time is
second best.

And while you're at it, be wary
of unprotected relationships with
untested ”experts.” Misinforma—
tion is highly infectious.

When 200,000 students
traveled to the self-
proclaimed, most tamous
beach in the world tor spring
break last week, they expect-
ed a party.

Eventually, they got one.
But things looked pretty tense
tor a while.

"We get here, we're ex-

we're greeted by bikers,"

Clarendon Plaza, the
I4-story hotel, which, for a
week, would be home to the
approximately 250 students
who went to Daytona Beach
through the Pitt Program
Council—sponsored trip.
Aside from the native bik-
ers, Pitt students arrived for

‘the final few days of Dayto-

na Beach's first Bike Week
Festival. According to The
News-lourna/, a Daytona
Beach daily paper, "... the
festival atmosphere made
Main Street a little less in-
timidating for those who don't
wear leather."

Despite the rugged, "in-
timidating" appearance of
the bikers and the numbers in
which they combed the

__ beaches and various area

resorts, spring breakers real-
ly had no cause for alarm, as
the week resulted in only one
major incident involving a bik-

er, when a visiting biker was

fatally shot by a police officer

‘March 4.

The biker was pulled over

after a police corporal saw
that he was in a traffic acci-
dent with his motorcycle. The
officer noticed the biker was
wearing a firearm under his
jacket and commanded the
biker to put his hands up. The
biker allegedly reached for
his gun, and that is when the
officer fired.

Though many students said
they were a little less than
happy with the number of bik-
ers in the area, the weather
was more of a concern.

"Since it's our first spring
break, I've been worried
about the weather. I'm so
psyched for this trip," said Pitt
senior Staci Sheppard.

It rained the first two days,
and it looked like it would for
the rest of the week.

prevailed Monday, and the
beaches were in business
again. And students made no
bones about what kind of
business transactions they
wanted to make.

''I'm here to get ham-
mered," said Villanova stu-
dent Joe Hall.

"We're here for three
things —- girls, beer and fun,"
according to Darren A. Rous-
seau, a student from William
and Mary College who
traveled to Daytona with
seven friends in a Win-
nebago.

There was plenty of all

three of those things, and
they weren't hard to find.

There were beer specials.
There were belly flop con-
tests. And wet T-shirt contests.
Several women from the
University of Pittsburgh partic-
ipated in them.

One Pitt female explained:
"l don't regret entering the
wet T-shirt contest because
it's spring break, and you're
supposed to be wild —- and
I'm a senior. I'm glad I didn't
take off my shirt, though."

While it was true that many
of the women removed their

T-shirts by the end of the can-

test, and some removed their
bikini bottoms — iust like in all
the spring break movies
you've seen —- some men
said they didn't particularly
like that.

''I thought it was rather
gross [when the girls took off
all of their clothes]," said
Chuck Stevenson, a Pitt junior.
"The ones who kept their
clothes on have class."

"I disagree. I don't think the
girls would take their clothes
off if they didn't want to get
pleasure out of it," said Pitt

senior Chris Dublino.

”There’s nothing tasteless
about it. lt's just the girls who
were taking off their shirts
who were tasteless," said
Dan Youngblood, a Pitt junior.
Some Pitt females said they
believed the intoxicated state
of many of the vacationers
had a lotto do with some of
the activities that took place.
''I think when you're drunk,
you're not as inhibited. If
you're going to do it, you'll
do it whether you're drunk or
not, though," said Tracy
Byers, a Pitt senior.
"The time l had was out of

Frank Scarpello.

The local authorities and
security guards were there to
make sure thin s didn't get
out of control, owever.

Clerks at the Clarendon

mischief is bothersome to
other guests (other than col-
lege students on spring
break), they have not really
had any major problems. "l
had a complaint about girls
with no tops on last night,"
said one clerk.

not be cause for great con-
cern. Other types of crime ex-

A security officer employed
by the Clarendon Plaza who
asked to remain anonymous
said generally, ''I think their
[spring breakers] main goal is
to go out, have a good time
and pick up members of the
opposite sex."

The officer said that most
arrests are for open contain-
er, which consists of having
alco
hol in a public area, which is
prohibited by Florida state
law.

According to local mer-
chants, shoplifting is not a
problem during break.

Pauline, who has worked
as a clerk at Lisa's Gifts on the
Boardwalk for nine years,

said there's no noticeable
difference in the amount of
shoplifting that occurs during
spring break compared to
any other time of the year.
She said that breakers do be-
come rowdy when they're in
a group.

"The police get here right
away. The police patrol this
area all the time. l think we're
more protected on the beach
that the stores on the
avenue," she said. ,

The Volusia County Beach
Patrol was also there to keep
things from getting out of

out of the water. One of th‘e
biggest problems is that peo-
ple aren't familiar with the
wcter. The other problem oc-
-curs when you get a lot of kids
together and you have a mix-
ture of personalities. They're
not here to be told what to do
by anybody — not by the
beach patrol and not by
another college student/'§

Crisp said the patrol is in
charge of 40 miles of beach.
While the patrol tries to at-
tend to all problems that
arise, staffing during the
spring break period totals
about 90-lO0 because the
winter duty is still in effect.
During the summer, the num-
ber increases to 200.

"We just run out of person-
nel. Right now, it causes big
problems," said Crisp. ‘,

The beach patrol does not
have police authority, but
they can enforce county regu-
lotions and sign warrants.

"College groups give us
the most problems. They
come down here, and they're
wired up," said Crisp. Ac-
cording to Crisp, the patrol
averages about 3,000 res-
cues a year, 600-700 of
which occur during the
6-week period of spring
break.

One of the biggest hotel
operators in Daytona Beach,
Chuck Penrod, owner of the
Clarendon Plaza, said the

safety of his hotel guests is oft‘:

the utmost concern.

"l think we're the only hotel
on the whole beach that locks
the balcony," said Penrod.

Most hotels in Daytona do
not lock the balconies. The
caption of a cartoon that ap-
peared in The Orlando Senti-
nal seemed to best describe
the situation. The cartoon
depicted two students check-
ing into a hotel. The caption
read: "Remember, don't fall
off the balcony, and if you
do, don't land on a biker."

ln fact, on Tuesday, March
8, the second area balcony
fall of the spring break season
occurred. ‘‘

Penrod said he does not
permit anybody in the hotel
rooms unless they are
registered guests. "| spend
$7,500 a week on security.
Anyone who comes into this
hotel with alcohol is lDed be-
cause my license is in
jeopardy," he said.

According to Penrod, 99
percent of the "kids" who are
on spring break are good.
"l’m a father; l know. There
are hundreds of girls who are

attacked by guys that you -

don't even hear about," he
said.

Penrod has been in the bus-
iness for eight years, and he
should know.

However, it seems that no
matter how much security
there is, mishaps will occur.

According to the paper,
AIDS has been cited as a rea-
son for the decline of qualified
paramedics who will work for
the Daytona Beach Fire
Department. The paramedics
do not want to be exposed
the deadly virus.

Many television specials,
magazine and newspaper or-
ticles have explored the col-
lege sex scene, and by
consensus, most of them have
concluded that college stu-
dents feel they are immune,
and thus do not ractice
"safe sex” as stead astly as
has been advised.

in addition to the various
night clubs dispensing con-
doms in the men's and wom-
en's restrooms, some of the
gift shops sold them also.

Daniel Myara, owner of
Cruisin’, a souvenir and T—shirt
shop, said this is the first year
his shop has sold condoms.
"Just because of spring break
and AlDS," he said.

The store features a novelty
keychain which can hold a
condom and on them are
printed slogans like, "You get
it up, I'll cover it." "lt's fun-
ny, but it's safe," said
lvlyara.

However, the keychains
aren't moving too well. "We
haven't sold any,” said one
employee.

T.C. Costa, owner of
T.C.'s Top Dog, boasts about
his "Official Daytona Spring
Break '88 Condoms." The
sign on his hot dog shop win-
dow reads: "T.C.'s got your
weenie covered."

"We want to help fight
AIDS. We're the only one in
Daytona that has a logo.
They come in designer colors,
too. Red, blue, green and
yellow,” said Costa. "The
kids need them. |'m here to fill
their needs. It started out as
a ioke, but l really believe that
they're the ultimate
souvenh/’

Jim Nesbitt, an employee
of T.C.'s, said that sales have
been good. "l think it's great.
It's a necessity."

ClEll:ll:l

Hard to swallow as it may
be, not everyone went to
Daytona to drink.

-The Campus Crusade for
Christ has been visiting Day-

tona Beach during spring
break season for more than
20 years.

Betty Churchill, a sopho-
more at Baylor University in
Texas (where drinking is pro-
hibited) and member of the
Crusade, said "Our main pur-
pose is to tell people how to
have a personal relationship
with God."

She and her friend, Laurie
Ericson, a junior at Ba lor,
said they — gulp — on't
drink.

''I don't drink at all. l've
seen how much it hurts. lt’s
one of those things you ask
yourself, why get started?"
said Ericson.

Churchill said she is in total
agreement. "|t's the world's
way to have fun. They don't
know any better. ln the mid-
dle of the week, you begin to
realize how empty it is," she
said.

While both admitted to a
less-than—enthusiastic recep-
tion from many of the spring
breakers, they maintained
that if they could enlighten
only one student, they ac-
complished something.

Pitt student Yvonne Barnes
said she didn't come to Day-
tona to drink either. "l heard
it was the place to go on
spring break. lt wasn't what
I expected, but it was OK."

The sentiments of sopho-
more Gil Borok were proba-
bly most representative of
those who went on the trip.
"Daytona was magic," he
said.

McRae leads Panthers to seventh in nation

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

An explosive Lee McRae cap-
tured his third consecutive
55-meter dash title at the NCAA
Indoor Track and Field Champi-
onships in Oklahoma City last
weekend.

McRae’s season-best perfor-
mance (6.07), combined with a
fourth—place finish in the
55—meter hurdles by Eric Cannon,
helped Pitt to a seventh—place fin-
ish overall.

Although McRae didn't go into
the meet with the best time
among the 55—meter entrants, Pitt

coach john Vasvary was not sur-
prised by his performance.

”Lee has gotten stronger every
week. It was no big surprise.
Coach [Steve] Lewis [Pitt's sprint
coach] thought when we left
[that] Lee was ready to go. Once
you saw Lee running in the trials,
you knew he was ready," said
Vasvary.

Probably the most anxious mo-
ment for the Pitt coaches was get-
ting McRae entered in his event.
Lee had run his only NCAA
qualifying time in The Athletics
Congress Championships. An in-
dividual may qualify for the
NCAAs by running a qualifying

time in an event run to NCAA
specifications even if the meet is
not a collegiate competition.

The individua|’s school must
contact the meet officials, and the
athlete must present a Proof of
Performance sheet to the starter
in his event.

McRae and Vasvary complied
with NCAA regulations, but still
there was controversy over
McRae’s inclusion in the
55—meter dash. The NCAA voted
in a resolution making it manda-
tory that qualifiers for the NCAA
championships in the future
qualify in collegiate meets.

coaching staff wanted to imple-

Big East teams ready for tournament action

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

NEW YORK —— Less than two
months ago P.J. Carlesimo’s job
appeared to be in jeopardy. The
Seton Hall coach had lame—duck
status. His team, picked fifth in
the Big East in the preseason
coaches’ poll, was stumbling
along at 2-6 in league games.

From all indications Carlesi-
mo’s sixth season at Seton Hall

would be his last. The students
called for his dismissal. His crit-
ics prayed for it. It seemed in-
evitable.

Carlesimo had the good sense
to ask for an extension of his con-
tract before the season started. He
was turned down.

The message was clear. Win or

lwalk the plank. The Pirates

responded and started winning.
Led by senior forward Mark
Bryant, Seton Hall rebounded in

BIG EAST
NOTEBOOK

the second half to finish with an
8-8 league record, including two
impressive wins over Pitt. The
day before the Big East Tourna-
ment, Carlesimo got what he had
been looking for — a new five-

ment the policy immediately but
was voted down.

In the race itself, McRae was
able to outsprint McNeese State's
Brian Cooper (6.11) to the tape.
Cooper had come into the meet
with the leading collegiate time
of the season (6.05).

For the second straight week,
Eric Cannon turned in a sterling
performance in the 55-meter hur-
dles. Two weeks ago, Cannon
garnered top honors at the IC4A
Championships by running a
7.18. At the NCAA champion-
ships this past weekend, Cannon
ran a 7.22, finishing fourth.

Pitt’s Dave Moore suffered an
injury the day before his event —

the 800-meter run - was to take
place and was unable to com-
pete. What was first feared to be
a stress fracture is now believed
to be a deep bruise.

In spite of the fact that only two
Panthers were able to compete in
nationals, Pitt once again has
finished in the Top 10 in the
country. Vasvary has established
Pitt as a team to be reckoned
with. With only national-
champion Arkansas as well as Il-
linois, Florida, Louisiana State,
Manhattan and North Carolina
State finishing ahead of Pitt, the
Panthers are optimistic as they
prepare for the outdoor season.

Despite loss to ’Ca ts,
Panthers given second
seed in Midwest region

By john Enright
Editor in Chief

NEW YORK —— Pitt is seeded
second in the Midwest Regional
of the NCAA tournament. That
means the NCAA selection com-
mittee considered the Panthers
one of the top eight teams in the
field of 64.

But all is not well with Paul
Evans’ team.

The Panthers, 23-6 overall and
ranked eighth in the final As-
sociated Press poll, are coming
off a disappointing loss to Vil-
lanova in the semifinals of the Big
East Tournament.

Pitt players said winning the
tournament would have meant
more to them than the regular
season crown they claimed by
beating Syracuse at the Carrier
Dome March 6.

”I’d rather win the [Big East]
tournament than the regular sea-
son,” said Pitt forward Jerome
Lane.

However, Demetreus Gore
and Charles Smith said the team
is ready for the NCAA tour-
nament.

”We’re not down at all,” Smith
said.

Evans is. He may have been the
one most upset by the loss, espe-
cially considering the opponent
was Villanova. The feud between
Evans and Villanova coach Rol-
lie Massimino has been well
versed.

When Pitt beat Villanova Feb.
16, the two coaches refused to
shake hands. Massimino said

year contract. He was also named
Big East Conference Coach of the
Year.

”I’m happy. I like it here. I like
the Big East,” said Carlesimo. ”I
didn't, to be perfectly candid,
think I wouldn't be here. I'm not
being smart. I am very apprecia-
tive. But I thought it would hap-
pen all along."

Seton Hall went out and had an
impressive tournament. The
Pirates beat Georgetown 61-58 in

Evans called him a very dirty
name. This time they shook
hands, but it wasn't the warmest
of exchanges.

Evans disappointment over los-
ing to Massimino’s team was ap-
parent in the post-game press
conference.

”Obviously, it's a disappoint-
ing loss. I'm just glad we have a
week to shake it off,” he said.

Pitt has little time to ponder the
mental mistakes that cost them
the Villanova game. Mental mis-
takes such as Lane leaving Mark
Plansky wide—open for a three-
pointer after he was’ instructed by
Evans to play straight up man-to-
man defense.

Plansky made the shot, putting

Villanova ahead for good, 70-69, .

and Evans berated Lane when Pitt
called a timeout.

he rift between Evans and Lane
is growing. Evans has complained
about Lane's intensity of late, and
the 6—foot—6 junior hasn't taken
the criticism well.

Said Lane: ”That's the way he
is. It don't matter what he says to
me. What he says just goes over
my head.”

Lane has said all season he will
leave Pitt and enter the NBA draft
if the Panthers win the national
championship.

Evans’ reaction in Sports Illus-
trated: "I like that trade-off.”

The Villanova game was Pitt's
second emotionally draining loss
in 11 days.

Lane second-team All-American

BY lim O'Connell

AP Basketball Writer

NEW YORK (AP) ~ Danny
Manning of Kansas was named to
The Associated Press All—America
basketball team for the second
straight year Monday. He was
joined by Hersey Hawkins of
Bradley, the highest scoring Di-
vision 1 player in 11 years.

Joining the two seniors on the
first team were senior Gary Grant
of Michigan, junior Sean Elliott of
Arizona and sophomoreJ.R. Reid
of North Carolina.

The team was selected by a
20-member panel of sportswriters
representing the AP and member
newspapers.

Manning was the only non-
senior on the first team last sea-
son, and the 6-foot-10 forward
managed a fine performance this
year despite injury and academ-

ic problems that plagued the
highly regarded Jayhawks.

’’I think he's had a phenomenal
year considering we've had so
many problems this year, and it's
added extra responsibility to Dan-
ny and he's done a tremendous
job,” Kansas coach Larry Brown
said Monday. ”|t’s an honor to be
a repeat choice, and that doesn’t
happen too often.”

Manning averaged 22.3 points
and 8.9 rebounds this season as
Kansas went 21-1 1 and was seed-
ed sixth in the Midwest Regional.

Hawkins, a 6-3 guard, enters
tournament play with a 36.0 scor-
ing average, the highest since
Freeman Williams of Portland
State averaged 38.8 in 1977. He
is also the first player to score
1,000 points in a season since
Williams in '77.

”He’s the consummate collegi-
ate player because he has an ab-

solute great demeanor for the
game and has seen every type of
defense thrown at him and he's
unflappable yet remarkably con-
sistent inasmuch as he's averag-
ing 36 points,” Bradley coach
Stan Albeck said Monday.
Bradley, 26-4, won the regular-
season and postseason Missouri
Valley Conference champion-
ships and will be the ninth seed
in the Southeast Regional.
Grant was known as much for
his defense as his impressive 22.0
scoring average. He led the Big
10 in steals three consecutive sea-
sons and averaged 6.9 assists per
game this season as the Wolver-
ines went 24-7 and were named
third seed in the West Regional.
Elliott averaged 19.0 points and
5.8 rebounds for the Wildcats
who were ranked No. 1 for six
weeks this season and are 31-2
and the top seed in the West. The

6-8 forward shot 57 percent from
the field.

Reid enjoyed a solid sopho-
more season as the 6-9 forward
averaged 17.9 points and 8.7 re-
bounds while shooting 61 per-
cent from the field as the Tar
Heels went 24-6 and were
tabbed second seed in the West.

Pittsburgh's Jerome Lane, who
was voted to the third team as a
sophomore last season, was
named to the second team this
year, along with Temple fresh-
man Mark Macon, Duke junior
Danny Ferry and seniors Steve
Kerr of Arizona and Jeff Grayer of
Iowa State.

The third team included Sher-
man Douglas of Syracuse; Fennis
Dembo of Wyoming; Bryon Lar-
kin of Xavier, Ohio; Will Perdue
of Vanderbilt and Michael Smith
of Brigham Young.

Hockey club finishes third in conference

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

Lakevue Ice Arena is quiet
now. Only a week and a half ago,
it was filled with cheering fans.

On Thursday, March 3, the Pitt
Panther Hockey Club took on the
Carnegie Mellon Tartans in the
second round of the West Penn
College Hockey Association
playoffs.

The Panthers lost to CMU 5-1.

Two minutes into the first peri-
od, the Tartans scored their first

goal. Two minutes later, they set
the puck up for a shot, only to
have their shot deflected by Chris
Studebaker, the Panthers’
goaltender.

The second period opened
with a glove save from Studebak-
er followed by a Tartan goal more
than a minute later.

The Tartans capitalized on yet
another scoring opportunity to
bring the score to 3-0.

Withleight minutes remaining
in the second period, Todd Rai-

ble, one of the Panthers’ assistant
captains, received a two-minute
elbowing penalty off of a Tartan
holding penalty.

Less than a minute later, Brian
Owens, the Panthers’ captain,
received a two—minute minor for
charging.

With the Panthers shorthanded,
John Blackwood of the Tartans
scored their fourth goal and his
third goal of the evening.

The Panthers opened the third
period with a goal scored at

10:47 by Bill Ohnhaus with the
assist credited to Jacobs, but
CMU countered with a goal of its
own to close out the scoring.

As the final buzzer sounded,
the Panthers skated over to con-
gratulate the Tartans. Michael
Kaleina, the WPCHA commis-
sioner, then gave the Panthers the
third-place trophy.

”We played one period well,
but you don't win games by only
playing one good period. You
have to play all three,” said

Coach Jeff Bele. ”They took us in
the first two periods, and we
couldn't pull out.”

”A goal always feels great, but
I'd trade a goal for a win any
day,” said Jacobs.

”We played a great third peri-
od. Had we played the first two
the way we played the last, we
would have won,” he added.

The Tartans victory was short-
lived, however. They traveled to
Erie to play Gannon University
and lost 6-5.

Pitt

Gore's last home game.

To add to its woes, Pitt's inten-
sity was lacking in both tourna-
ment games, something that

concerns Evans.

”Vi|lanova had more intensity
than us,” Evans said.

Pitt was also flat for the first 10
minutes of its quarterfinal match-

up with Connecticut. But after
leading by only one point at half-
time, the Panthers blew out the
Huskies in the second half, win-
ning 75-58.

Connecticut coach Jim Cal-
houn praised Pitt's players and
said his team was simply over-
matched. ”We just flat-out got
beat by a better team. That was
evident to me. Normally, it isn’t.”

The Panthers face 15th-seed
Eastern Michigan Friday at 1:07
EST at Devaney Sports Center in
Lincoln, Neb.

The winner of that game will
play the Vanderbilt-Utah State
winner Sunday at 2:25.

Eastern Michigan, the champi-
ons of the Mid-American Confer-
ence, is 22-7. The Hurons are led
by 6-8 Grant Long who averages
23.2 points and 10.6 rebounds
per game.

Eastern Michigan's other start-
ers are: 6-5 forward Brad Souzie

(9 ppg, 2.4 rpg), 6-6 center Isaac
Henderson (7 ppg, 4.9 rpg), 5-10
guard Howard Chambers (11.9
ppg, 2.2 rpg) and 5-11 guard
Lorenzo Neely (11 ppg, 2.7 rpg).

Pitt and Eastern Michigan have
played one common opponent.

Pitt defeated Chicago State
89-63 at Fitzgerald Field House.
Eastern Michigan lost to Chicago
State 83-80.

”We’re always outmanned in
terms of size,” said Eastern Michi-
gan coach Ben Braun. ”Pitt's go-
ing to have a big advantage there.
it's just a matter of playing to our
potential, not worrying about
mismatches either way.

”Pitt has tremendous talent,
and we're just going to try to play
as well as we can.”

Evans has the same attitude. He
said he knows nothing about
Eastern Michigan. But he has to
be more concerned about his
own team, which has lost three

of its last six games.

Evans hopes going to the Mid-
west will help. ”After the way we
played [in New York], with the
party life, maybe that [Lincoln] is
a good place for us to go.”

Smith, Miller honored

Last night, Panther senior
Charles Smith was named Big
East Player of the Year while
Sean Miller grabbed Freshman
of the Year honors.

Smith averaged over 18
points per game and 7.7 re-
bounds in leading Pitt to a
23-6 record and the regular
season championship.

Miller averaged over 10 ppg
and 5.7 assists per contest. He
was named Big East Freshman
of the Week four times during
the season. He has hit on 47
percent of his 3-point shots.
