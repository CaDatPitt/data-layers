Miller Worries About

Conscription in Debut

Just on the chanicethat you might

have been able to forget about it,
next Wednesday’s issue of the Pitt
Panther will be devoted to conscrip-
tion.

This piece of information was di-
vulged by editor Frank S. Miller,
C41, who leered as he revealed that
the ﬁrst issue of the magazine will
emphasize “readability and sparkle.”
On the serious side will be a group
of articles on the relation of the
new draft bill to the student at Pitt.
From the comedy angle will be a
satirical piece on how the Pitt cam-
pus may be used as a site for train-
ing grounds.

To facilitate meeting “that blonde
with the green armband,” photo-
graphs of frosh lovelies will be run,

along with all important telephone

numbers. A sort of rotogravure

Men’ s Health
Service Shifts
To Cathedral

Men’s Student Health Service is
temporarily located on the thirty-
third ﬂoor of the Cathedral, but will
be moved elsewhere in the building
within a few weeks, announces Dr.
H. Clifford Carlson, director of the
service. The men’s division of the
Student Health Servic-e was former-
ly in Falk Clinic.

Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, director
of the Women’s Health Service, and
Dr. Carlson are concluding physical
examinations this week for all en-
tering fresrmen, as their ﬁrst major
step in the year’s efforts to safe-
guard student health.

The examinations, required of all
new freshmen and transfer students,
will be given in the headquarters
of both health services—twenty-
eighth ﬂoor Cathedral for women,

and thirty-third ﬂoor, Cathedral for ,

men.

“Appointments with the heads of
the Health Service should be made
as soon as possible,” the directors

request, “so that we can schedule
the students with adequate time to
discuss with us their personal
health problems.”

Hospitalization
Will Benefit
New Students

Subscribers to Make
Insurance Payment
By First of October

The far-reaching V group, hospital-
ization insurance plan, introduced
last spring by the Pitt News and
the Student Health Service as an
attempt to protect University stu-
dents against the ﬁnancial shock
of sudden, serious illness by offer-
ing them 21 days of hospitalization,
will also be made available to en-
tering freshmen.

The hospitalization drive will be
renewed with the collection of the
ﬁrst semester’s fees, amounting to
$2.50. All who signed last spring,
as well as all freshmen desiring to
be protected under the plan, should
make this payment at the treasur-
er’s ofﬁce, State Hall, before Octo-
ber 1.

Students Protected

The plan, ﬁrst of its kind ever
undertaken by a college or a uni-
versity, is regarded as a valuable
corollary to the functions of the
Student Health Service. Students
who register for the service will be
insured throughout the semester
against hospital bills and will be
granted hospital admission at any
time during the semester upon the
approval of Dr. H. C. Carlson, di-
rector of the University Health
Service.

Enthusiastically received upon its
inception last spring, the hospital-
ization plan was then as it is now
regarded as “the answer to a vital
student problem.” Members of the
administration, faculty, and student
body today alike gave the plan the
unqualiﬁed support of the entire
University, as many student activ-
ities signed up for the plan en
l’DaSSI€.

Carlson Approves

Most enthusiastic in his support 3
‘of the hospitalization

however, was Dr. Carlson, director
of the University’s Student Health
Service.

Said Dr. Carlson, “It is with the
greatest pleasure and eagerness that
I am looking forward to the incep-
tion of the hospitalization plan this
fall. Such a plan will reap untold
benefits in student health here at
the University.”

“With University students pro-
tected against the dilemma of in-
sufficient funds in time of serious
illness by a hospitalization insur-
ance plan,” continued Dr. Carlson,
“1 predict a sharp rise in the func-
tioning ability of the Men’s Health
Service, whose decisions to place
students in a hospital must many
times be disregarded because stu-
dents are not ﬁnancially prepared
to meet the" expenses.”

What You Get

Speciﬁc services rendered to those
under the plan in time of serious ill-
HESS are:

(1) Room and board in ward ac-
commodations for a total of 21 days
each school year in any of Pitts-
burgh’s 25 largest hospitals. The
student may select accommodations
in a semi-private or private room
with an allowance of $3 per day to-
ward the purchase of these better
accommodations. ‘

(2) '~‘Us'eiof the operating room as
often as necessary.

(3) Anesthesia as often as ne-
cessary. _

(4) Ordinary drugs and medica-
tions.

(5) Necessary dressings and casts.

(6) Routine laboratory services.

(7) Ordinary X-ray.

Chancellor Bowman Appeals for Interchange
Of Good Will in Address Welcoming Freshmen

By Edgar Beigel

Belaying the extent of material-
ism and “money-making” ideals
among new University students,
Chancellor John G. Bowman, in an
address Monday afternoon, called
upon freshmen to “cultivate an in-
terchange of good will,” to assimi-
late themselves with “expressions
of inspiration,” such as those cre-
ated by the beauty of the Commons
Room.

Speaking before the annual Chan-
cellor’s assembly for freshmen in
the Stephen Foster Memorial, Dr.
Bowman emphasized that “the most
expensive experiment in world his-
tory” is now going on in the United
States——education.

“The greatest safety valve for
democracy is the cultivation of a

high level of intelligence. And the
core of that intelligent group can
only develop within our universi-
ties,” he said.

“The task of the University today
is the promotion of our most pre-
cious gift—-individual ability.”

Contrasting the genius produced
by the pre-Renaissance Florentine
schools, Dr. Bowman expressed the
need of the “superlatively intelli-
gent” group of students similar to
the Oxford-Cambridge h o n o r s
course students that supply the
bulk of England’s leaders in gov-
ernment, business, and industry.

“To supply this community with
able leaders, the people of Pitts-
burgh during the past twenty years
have put $27,000,000 into building
the University, supplemented by 12

to 14 millions from the state,” the
Chancellor revealed. “The Univer-
sity labors to produce good doctors,
good engineers, and good adminis-
trators, at great expense. A year’s
education in the medical school costs
$1,030, while a student’s expense is
but $400.” Likewise the cost of a
year’s education in engineering is
double the $300 tuition paid by the
student.

“At great public cost the Univer-
sity is er.-dcavoi'ing to cultivate the
ability of students. But the re-
sponsibility is partly the students’,”
l./1‘. Bowman said. “To those of
you who accept ‘C’ as a ‘gentle-
man’s mark,’ I advise you to go
home . . . At this meeting you are
more equal than you will ever be
in the next four years. But intel-
lectual development is not itself

sufficient. Many straight-‘A’ stu-
dents have left the University and
failed. Only through social orien-
tation, through development of emo-
tions and personality proper to a
spirit of kindness and good-will,
will you be able to emerge as a
leader.”

“To give you those moments of
creative inspiration we have built
one of the most beautiful structures
in the world. And only through a
desire for voluntary self-creation
can a student’s ability receive in-
spiration for proper development.
The atmosphere has been created.
The choice is yours” Dr. Bowman
concluded.

The Chancellor was introduced
by Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear dean of
men, who welcomed the class of
19-14 to their first assembly.

Frosh Women

licized activities of the entire week,

This is the time when college editors pigeon-hole their own
misgivings and try to evaluate for the newcomers the purpose of
university life. ,

Evaluation is hard this year. There is a tendency and an op-
portunity to be pretentious and to compare the modern collegian
with the monks of the dark ages. In other words, “You’re the
boys who are to keep the torch of VVestern learning aﬂanic, etc.,
etc.” \Vestern culture may be heading fora crash but we don’t
think American college students can prevent the crash or pre-
serve the culture. The idea, however, is dismally dramatic and
unfortunately will find its way into many welcoming addresses.

    
   
 

  

‘We say unfortunately because the class of 1944 is going to .3 I 7 -A,
have enough trouble getting adjusted to the normal lTniversit.y 
routines; constant emphasizing of “duties to civilization” will put 1’
them into too great awe of college. We don’t think this awe is e§",,§;’:,,A~_

good for the orientation program.

But even if today’s college student can’t save the world, he
can serve it. He can serve it by grasping the rational and tolerant
approach that should be the intellectual badge of the educated.
This rational approach, let’s call it objective thinking, can do much
to smother the hates evidenced in every phase of today ’s life. This
rational approach can be secured in few places today. H

It is gone from our newspapers, it is leaving our forums; it
is still in our colleges and universities. It is still present, to a
greater or lesser degree, in political science classes, in the philo-
sophy courses, in the history seminars, in the humanities, in all the
non-technical. subjects which should be on the schedule card of each
fife sliman.

Conscription ‘Course’ Exemptions
Granted to University Students

The ranks of University students will not be depleted this year by the
conscription bill, according to provisions of the act promulgated last week.

FRESHMEN! Here’s One Rule
Not In The Book

OU may have to wear a freshman cap, but

there’s no rule against wearing Arrow
shirts. No doubt you’ve discovered by this
time that more college men wear Arrow shirts
than any other brand shirt. There are reasons:
The superb Arrow collar, the Mitoga cut, the
anchored buttons, and the permanent ﬁt (San-
iorized-Shrunk, fabric shrinkage less than
1%). All these extra values plus authentic
styling are yours for the small sum of $2.

The News herewith presents an excerpt from the act and a resolution
by the Board of Trustees relating
to the most discussed topic i.n the
Cathedral today.

Conscription bill: as passed by
Congress, as signed by the Presi-
dent:

“Any person who, during the
year 1940 entered upon attend-
ance for the academic year 1940-

l94.1——(1) at any college or uni-
versity which grants a degree in
arts or science to pursue a course
of instruction satisfactory comple-
tion of which is prescribed by such
college or university as a prere-
quisite to either of such degrees;
or (2) at any university described
in paragraph (1), to pursue a
course of instruction to the pur-
suit. of which a degree in arts or
science is prescribed by such uni-
versity as a prerequisite, and who,
while pursuing such course of in-
struction at said college or univer-
sity, is selected for training and
service under this act prior to the
end 01' such academic year, or prior
to July 1, 1941, whichever occurs
first, shall, upon his request, be
deferred irom induction into the
land or naval forces for such
of such academic year, but in no
event later than July 1, 1941.”

 

ance in the semester involved, and
full credit for tuition paid and for
work satisfactorily done on the
interrupted attendance shall be
given on return later to the Uni-
versity.”

Tom Brownﬁs College Hbays

Tom Brown graduated high school and wanted to come to the
lV,'ni_vei-sity of Pittsburgh. Tliat is the conventional ’ay to begin
a conventional short’ story; except that Tom Brown is X, repre-
sentative of hundreds like him.

Tom had. no money, but he was determined. -to enter college.
'l‘liere'Eorc. for iiarrative convenience, he became a bank messenger.
 y~zn‘ of this left him with VVl’lZll3lSC€lll€('?l~€l10ll{.?Tll to hold: hiin
through his first year.

He enrolled at l:’itt, worked in the cafeteria, made fairly decent
grades on his blue print.

Tom Brown was, suddenly, stricken with appendicitis. He
needed an operation, the price of which eventually forced him out
of school.

’l‘om’s a bank messenger now. He’s discouraged. He doesn’t
grive a darn whether he gets back to college or not.

Tom Brown, as we have said, is x. X could just as easily have
been you. That is, it could have been until group liospitalization

With the Ohio State battle but a _ _ 2  '
week and a half in the offing, head  it  H A if
coach Charley Bowser is sending his
grid forces through strenuous prac-
tice sessions twice daily.

Although seven first stringers are
missing from last year’s varsity
-eleven and a total of eleven letter-

mcn have walked the diploma plank,
there’s a rugged looking squad up
on Trees Field. Early season in-
juries have left gaping holes in
both the first and second team, but
there sun seems to be plenty of
football talent around.

Erstwhile tackle Al Gurczenski
has moved into a ﬁght with Junior
Stan Gcrvelis, left end understudy
last season for the left terminal
berth. The husky Jeannette senior
moves his 198 pounds with surpris-
ing speed and a temporary injury
to Gervelis has placed him in the
front slot. Joe Rettinger has shift-
ed to the right ﬂank a step ahead
of senior letterman Jack Goodridge.

Jack Benz, 210 pound senior,
pairs with Ted Konetsky, ﬁrst string,
ior the third straight year at the
tackle posts. At the guards veteran
Rudy Gradisek and junior Ralph
Fife, 20 pounds heavier than last
year and not a mite slower, form a
crack duo.

Junior Steve Si.nco makes that
pivot position look very well taken

the Panthers enter their first year under full adherence to Big Ten

Head of the Pitt strategy board,

That period should be devoted to

spective band members attend

register for the band in 803' Cathe-
dral all this week from 9 until 12

Two combined tryouts for the

day afternoons, September 23 and
27 respectively, from 4 until 5:30

dar of events which tells you that
there is a-tea dance on Wednesday,

begin January 25. Much mystery
surrounded the double asterisks at
the top ofevery lVlonday’s schedule
until some inquiring speculators
came to disillusionment by discov-
ering that they were placed on the
original copy by the dean of wom-
en’s office to indicate to the printer
that each Monday began a new
pasgc. The enterprising man acci-
dentally included them as a purely
decorative note.

The men’s Compass follows much
the same pattern as the women’s
book and is bound in startling
green. Included as a new feature
this year is a table of activities
points for every extra—curricular
actvity.

K on-0-If wee Scene

The Pitt

Above is a scene, soon to be repeated, showing upperclassmen and
incoming freshmen in one of their informal seminars at last Year’s
week-end camp at Kan-O-Kwee, near Zelienople. Lasting from Friday
through Sunday, this year’s camp sessions will offer to some 175 ﬁrst
year men a. crowded calendar including sports, discussions, a. sorig fest,
and stunt night. A contingent of 45 faculty members and student. leaders

will also be on hand.

Needy Students Apply for Aid
On NYA, Part-Tiine Positions

Freshman students desiring part-
time employment to earn a portion
of their college expenses havesome
opportunity, through the services
of the Student Employment Service
and the National Youth Administra-
tion, to work at jobs and attend
school at the same time.

NYA work is offered to about 500
needy students each year. Positions
are given to students according to
their need for employment to meet
expenses. The following types of
positions are usually open: typing,
library, research, laboratory, infor-
mation desk, and guides, etc.

Robert J. Munce, instructor in
sociology, is in charge of NYA
work at the’UniVersity. Applica-
tions are accepted in 2902 Cathe-
dral. An application form must be
filled out and the applicant must
take an oath of allegiance to the
United States. All applications
must be notarized.

The Student Employment Service
for men is located i.n 804 Cathedral
and is managed by George M. Wal-
ton. Men students who feel that
they cannot continue to attend the
University without obtaining em-
ployment should consult Mr. Wal-
ton immediately and ﬁll out an ap-
plication.

It has been explained by the serv-
ice that freshmen have diiﬁculty in
obtaining employment because of
their youth and lack of experience
and because they are not known
enough to be given an unqualified
recommendation.

Miss Frances McLaughlin, assist-
ant to the dean of women, takes
charge of part-time employment for
women at the University. About
one-half of the women apply for
work, and positions are found for
about four-ﬁfths of these.

Upperclass women are considered

The trustees’ resolution says that

The only catch in the draft bill

The moral of this catch is: don't

tion mad at you, or you may get
kicked out of school—and right in-
