f0un(lVesl- or ﬂux (‘zip aml liowii Cllll) in l9()>‘s, has stated is a goo<l
script, good music, and traditional dancing.

Author Hyde was well prepared to write his first opus. Wiile an
undergraduate he was active in literary circles, serving as copy editor
of the Pitt News and as president of the Quill club.
He receivecl his musical show training by spending
four years in the Cap and Gown chorus, ending up with
three lines in last year’s show and the vice-presidency
of the Undergraduate Cap and Gown club.

Hyde combined his experiences in producing “Head
Over Heels,” :1 saga of papers and capers. from the
Daily Star——circu1ation 98.6 degrees—to the Ballet
de Castle Shannon—mostly from Squirrel Hill.

Action centers about reporter Johnny Higgins
(Richard Lambie, C42) and Adrienne Butterﬁeld (Ed-
win Trembath, BA41) daughter of Johnny’s boss, who
is masquerading in the Ballet Russe de Castle Shziiinoii
as Camille, prima ballerina. Adrienne is considerably hampered by her
father’s ignorance of her career. his belief that she has been studying music
at a southern college, his dislike of Johnny. .

But there’s always an uncle, this time Johnny’s. He dies. leaving his
sole property, which turns out to be the BRdeCS. to Johnny. The plot
thickens, ably assisted by the newspaper associate of the hero: drama
critics Kaspar Harold Mulligan (James Dunn., C44): Mickey Finn, love-
lorn—columnist Beatrice Fairface” (Robert Soles, C43); and oft-at-the-
wedding-but-ne’er-the-bride Sadie Plotgut (William Rial, E41).

His friends serve Johnny little avail, for sure-ﬁre bill collectors Moe
and Joe (Alexander Eiidy, C44, and Harold Goltsman, C41) are after him
and the ballet.

Papa-Boss Butterﬁeld (Jerome Lieber, BA41) unknowingly, but will-
ingly. adds to the troubles of forbidding Adrienne to dance again. But the
Ballet Must Go On, says director, choreographer, designer Boris Petrov-
sky (Allen Gould, BA43) and Sadie, now known as Dolores Romona, the
Hollywood dancer. Sadie—Do1ores dances in “Ninotchka"s Dream.” _

The ballet would be a Shabelevsky nightmare_, but it provides an
hilarioiis-audieiice with a precision-dance step, slapstick. So ends act one.

The bill collectors continue to plod their merry way into act two, but
stop long enough for Adrienne and Johnny, assisted by the stall, to put
on the “Swing Ballet” with Adrienne as the lead, and the show ends happily
about 11 o’clock. '

No little credit for what promises to be one of the better of the 34»
Cap and Gown’ shows belongs to director Edward A. Morgan, of Spring-
ﬁeld. lVl'c‘iSS., who is putting forth his ﬁrst all-male venture. and to Max
Adkins who returns again to Cap and Gown from the Stanley theater for
one week as musical director.

Technical direction is by Frank Mason, who performs the same task
for Pitt Players, and the sets were designed by James Lindsay, former
Cap and Gown producing director.

The Pitt News-Stiideiit Health
service \\'asseriiiaiiii test cani-
paign opens today offering to
every Uiiive-i'sit._v student the op-
portiiiiity to secure a blood test
free of cliarge.

With facilities installed in the
Cathedral student health services
by the Pittsburgh Syphilis Control
board, the tests will be administered
under the direction of Dr. H. C.
Carlson and Dr. Auleene M. Jami-

son, directors of student health
services.

Inaugurated by the Pitt News
four years ago, the campaign this
year is expected to better the rec-
ord of 2,570 set in the initial drive.

University medical attaches are
prepared to handle an extremely
large number of students expected
to respond to the anti-syphilis cam-
paign. Dr. Carlson’s oiﬁces on the
thirty-fourth floor of the Cathedral
will test University men. Women
will be tested at the Women’s
Health service on the twenty-eighth
floor.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, and Miss Helen Poole Rush,
assistant to the dean of women,
have voiced their approval of the
campaign as have Joseph Roberts,
BA4l, president of Student—Facul—
ty association, Gene Tedick, C41,
president of the College associa-
tion, Mziry Ruth Hosey, C41, presi-
Mary dent of the Women’s Self
Government association, and Jean
Brink, C42, president—elect of
WSGA.

During the first campaign against
syphilis four years ago, 600 students
were tested the first Week.

Allresults of the tests are con-
fidential and no percentage or ratio
figures are available. The only fact
that may be revealed about the tests

The News has been asked to ex-
plain the procedure in taking
blood tests for the Wassermzmii
examination.

This test, one of science’s most
important strides, is surprisingly
simple.

Blood is taken from a vein in
the arm by means of a. needle so
sharp that it causes scarcely any
pain. A tourniquet is ﬁrst applied

above the spot the needle ig._,tq.- H,

enter. ,
When the needle enters the _
about 5 to 8 cc’s of blood’«, .,
drawn, not enough to make;_
difference to the patient,

The main work of the test is‘

done after the patient leaves. The
blood must be analyzed and test-
ed for positive or negative reac-
tions.

is that no deﬁnitely positive case,
indicating syphilis, has been re-
ported in the four years the tests
have been made.

. The main work of the blood tests
is done after the tests have been
made. The blood is sent to the
‘City-County laboratories where it
is analyzed for positive or negg,
tive reactions. The laboratory
work takes several days and some-
times a week. Complete results
are then sent to the Health services
to be Fehorted to the individual con-
cerned. '

For a Good Cause

WE JUDGE the nobility of a man's cause by
the extent to which that man is called upon
to make sacriﬁce.

For no other serious disease is there so sure
a cure. say the posters. They might have added
that no other serious disease. left untreated.
can produce such ghastly results. Syphilis
strikes at all parts of the body. It leaves it vic-
tims blind. deaf, and crippled.

The subject is not one to be treated as a per-
sonal matter. A broken leg is a man’s own bus-
iness. It hurts no one but himself. Syphilis,
however. has too many social aspects to be
ignored. There are too many innocent victims
who have been harmed by the carelessness and
the ignorance of others.

There are those who consider themselves as
having contributed to the social welfare and
health of their fellow men because they have
made a donation to some community chest. This
they consider to be their great sacriﬁce.

Those who are in charge of the campaign ask
no sacriﬁce. ﬁnancial or otherwise. The pro-
cedure is an easy one. That, however, is not our
contention. We believe that no amount of self-
denial is too great to ask in such a case.

Nor is there room for the syphiliphobiac who
is afraid that he has the disease, yet will not
take the test because he fears that he may be
“discovered.” The spirochete rides the street-
cars and the bus; it lingers on the drinking-glass
and the doorknob. Never does it take into ac-
count that its victim may be psychologically
afraid to submit himself to a test.

On the face of it, there is no reason for the
difficulty which is encountered by those who are
honest enough to present the truth to the public.
Yet the difficulty is there. Only a fraction of
those who might have been tested in the past
have pei-mitted it.

The matter
is too important to the general mass of society
to £1»: pas:'~:.e-ci oil’ lightly  an affair to be left to
the =;:ii;i>a,..'e'tion only of the person direct.if,' con-

For this there can be no excuse.

Baseball Brings Back
Pitt Parking Problem

WITH THE OPENING of the baseball season
last Friday. car-driving students were and will
be again confronted with an abundance of park-
ing tickets and a lack of parking space. During
the game numerous cars were tagged for the
violation of the two-hour restriction in the
Lytton avenue area and others were completely
blocked in by the cars of baseball fans parked
in the Plaza.

A forceful complaint by the administration
last year resulted in the removal of the two-
hour ban on the Cathedral side of Fifth avenue.
But this alone is not sufficient to accommodate
even a fraction of the student body. The out-
look this year is as dismal as in former years.

The Pittsburgh Athletic association last year
hired a city policeman to patrol the streets near
the Cathedral. He did. Chalk marked tires
and parking tickets resulted. The red tags on
cars Friday indicated that this year the PAA is
following the same procedure to assure suffi-
cient space for their members to park during
lunch hours.

To the students the parking problem is vital.
The city has never taken action to provide ade-
quate parking facilities and chances are they
will continue to remain as uninterested parties.
Our neighbors on the other side of the street are
satisﬁed to pay an ofﬁcer $6.20 per day and en-
tirely disregard the needs of the 600 student
parkers.

Ruskin ﬁeld is available for parking at ten
cents per car, but it is just a partial answer to
the question as not more than 150 students could
be accommodated. The other alternative is for
students to ride the street cars, but in many
cases this is not a possible solution.

As long as the PAA—paid cop continues to
swagger and as long as the Pittsburgh Pirates
can maintain a stronger lobby downtown than
the University, students will continue to suffer
every year when. baseball season rolls around.

;a shrewd political move by voting
to rc-ject one of the slated candi-

the coming SFA elections.

Paul Schaughnessy, C43, Sigma

Independent political move. The
rejection of Schaughnessy 35 3-
Fraternity nominee was attempt“
ed by the Independents. The
,-move was an obvious device to
weaken the fraternity slates by
.causing the removal of one house
from them.

The stroke of political good for-
tune which gave the Independents
their success in this move was a
temporary Independent majority
in the executive committee due to
the absence of the three faculty
members: Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,
dean of men, Miss Thyrsa W. Amos,
dean of women, and Theodore W.
Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men.

ing nxajority of three to two in
the Thursday meeting, which was
called for the purpose of selecting
enough additional candidates for
 to fill out the required num-
ber of 60 under the provisions of
the constitution.

Disagreement over the voting
power of the chairman was a fea-
ture of the meeting. Consultation
with Roy Umble, instructor in
speech and parliamentarian of SFA,
brought out that the chairman has
the right to vote under certain con-
ditions which existed at the time
of the rejection of Schaughnessy.
Roberts’ “Rules of Order" states
that when the chairman’s vote
would bring up the minority vote
to a point where it could tie and
thus defeat a motion, he has the
power to cast his ballot.

It is an accepted political move
to nominate men and women of the
opposition party during these ses-
sions of the executive committee

this year is, however, the first of
its kind in the memory of most
campus political observers. It was
the fact that a slated candidate was
rejected that made the action by
the executive committee so unu-
sual

Adjournment of the meeting be-
fore the full list of candidates was
chosen necessitated the calling of
another session. Scheduled for
tomorrow, the meeting is expect-
ed to bring a motion for recon-
sideration of the action taken
Thursday. There is more than a
good possibility that Schaughen-
essy’s name will go back on the
ballot.

Action to eliminate the ﬁlling of

Lately I’ve considered trying to write children’s stories.

And so

every morning of vacation when the neighbors’ children and their friends
——all their friends—yelled me out of a sound sleep, I decidedlto listen

and learn. Not that I wouldn’t
rather have poured buckets of wa-
ter down on them. But I’m tired
at eight in the morning, aren’t you?

Well, I found out that people
whose eyes overflow with tears of
tenderness at the mention of little
children at play have a lot to learn.
The sweet kids start out something
like this:
is Conversation Piece

"Bang, bang——fall down, you’re
dead!”

“I shot you first.”

“Like hell you did.
before you drew.”

“New. he shot you first, so fall
down,” eight or eighty voices
SCil‘C€;lll’l. And he falls down or else.

After everybody’s dead, they do

I shot you

something else. These kids play
inarbles. I don’t know anything

about that, and since I couldn’t fol-
low the conversation—polite word
——I’d try to sleep. I knew that if
they started something else, there
was no chance of me missing it.

0 The Children’s Hour

One morning, the next item on
the program was an argument
something like this:

“Wut"s better, Florida or Cali-
fornia?”

“Florida’s better.”

“Aw, you‘re crazy, Ca1ifornia’s

better. It got a seacoast.”

They played hide and seek next
to the rhythmical call “base hugger!
base hugger!” The gang was ex-
cited by this time. I could tell that
a ﬁght was coming. The morning
ﬁghts began with a 7/3 second si-
lence, developed into chaos, and
ended with somebody socking some-

body else for socking his kid
brother. Then everybody went
home.

I don’t wanna write children’s
stories. I wanna write like Tolstoi.

Pitt Nine Wins; Trackers Crushed

Malloy Hurls Fine
Ball Against Army

By simply combining good pitch-
ing with good hitting Pitt's base-
ball team this morning boasts it's
best won-and-lost record in the
three years since the sport was
revived on a varsity basis by the
University. The Panthers now have
won three and lost two.

Bob Malloy. sophomore right-
hander. took care of the pitching
end Saturday by limiting Army’s
perviously unbeaten nine to eight
hits. while striking out 13 West
Pointers. Panther batters. mean-
while, took advantage of ﬁve Army
errors, hit with men on base, and
pounded out a 9-3' win, six of their
runs coming in the last three in-
nings.

Hitting stars for the Panthers
were Johnny Vaiknsor, Edgar Jones,
Frank Goelz. and Johnny Brown.
Vaiknsor, who replaced George
Jacobs at shortstop after Jacobs had
started the ﬁrst four games of the
season, punched out three singles.
drove in two runs, and scored one
himself. Jones connected twice.
scored once. and batted in a tally,
Goelz scored twice and drove in :1
runner with his one hit, and Brown
tripled for the only Pitt extra base
blow, later crossing the plate.

Army went ahead 2-0 in the
third, then 3-2 in the fourth, but
after Pitt. tied it up in the ﬁfth, the

Cadets were through. for the day.
They threatened in the ninth by
loading the bases with one out. but
Malloy bore down and fanned the
last two batters to end the game.

B zz.cke_yeslTlri um ph

Probably one of the gloomiest
men on the Pitt campus today is
track coach Carl Olson. The reason
for this gloom is the 80-51 plaster-
ing hung on the Panther trackers
by Ohio State Saturday, the worst
defeat administered to a Pitt track
team since Olson became coach in
1932.

Undoubtedly. Olson is wondering
what might have happened‘ had
Happy Stickel. sprinting ace who
pulled :1 leg muscle last week and
was a spectator Saturday, been run-
ning. But even Olson must admit
that it wouldn’t have made a great
deal of difference.

Excluding a brilliant showing by
Sticke’s running,‘ mate. Bullet Bill
Carter, who took firsts in the 100,
the 220, and the broad jump, the
clean sweep scored by Panthers El-
lott, Rhoades. and Fridley in the
javelin, and the expected one-two
showing of Dusty Rhoades and Red
Jessup in the pole vault, the Buck-
eyes had things all their own way.

Grid Varsity Wins

opened the festivities a few minutes
after the opening gun sounded by
intercepting a badly thrown pass
and galloping 30 yards for the
touchdown.

After a scoreless second quarter.
the varsity combination was
brought to life by the spectacular
runs of sophomore Jack Stetler.
Ross then made his second touch-
down with a well executed run off
right tackle that made the score.
13-0.

The ﬁnal quarter saw the losers
vainly trying to stop the enemy as-
sault, but to no avail. Stetler scor-
ed from the four yard line, and
Ross added his last tally of the day.
Stan Gervelis added the three extra
points for the victorious ﬁrst team.

A new notch must be made in
the hard-luck annals of sport for
freshman Fred Davis, who twirled
a no-hitter and slammed out two
of his team’s three hits, but had to
watch his PiKA teammates drop
one to the Phi Gams, 2-1, on Thurs-

day.
The PiKA team opened the at-
tack in the third inning when

three walks off Colvin and an
error netted one run.

With two down in the fourth, Phi
Gains Colvin and Bitner walked.
Quick then hit a long ﬂy into Carl-
son’s hands, but the PiKA center-
ﬁelder dropped the ball. Carlson
then threw perfectly to Syka who
fumbled the ball as Quick slid into
second. Both runners tallied on
the play.

Slugging their way to victory,
the Phi Eps practically knocked the
defending champions, Sigma Alpha
Mu, out of the running with a 14-3
conquest.

“Red” Siliverman opened the
game for last year’s champs, but
after the Phi Eps scored three
runs in the ﬁrst and ﬁve in the big
second, featured by Hirsh’s homer
with two on, he was relieved by
Hurwitz.

Aided by a million dollar inﬁeld.,
Jay Silverberg limited the Sam-
mies to only two hits in recording
his second straight victory.

The Phi Delts lost their second
straight in a slugfest to the Delts,
14-12.

Neither team had any sort of a
pitcher and both had to depend on
inﬁeld and slugging strength for
victory. Delt sluggers Cannon and
Krunkleton blasted homers with
men on base, While Phi Delts Black
and Jones connected with the paths
clear.

In one of the day’s earlier games
the Phi Kaps beat SAE, 9-0, on So-
tek’s shut out pitching. Sotek was
aided by Hughes’ second inning
home-run with a man on the sacks.

Sigma Chi continued undefeated
as they slugged their way to a 10-5
victory over Theta Chi. Homers
by Roberts and by Ball helped Sig-
ma Chi twirler Coxey best Fred
Sneddon in this game.

Kappa Sigma took one the easy
way as the Lambda Chi Alpha out-

Coxey, Sigma Chi hur.le:', with

Kramer Leads
Pitt Golf Team

Only two lettermen return to
coach Art Underwood’s varsity golf
squad for the 1941 season. But
Underwood doesn’t worry much
about that; of last year’s crew only
holdovers Bill Kramer and Bob
Seybold were consistent perform-
ers.

Playing in the number one and
number two spots respectively,

All those who wish to try out
for the golf team should see Ollie
Stiff at the Stadium for eligibility
cards, and should contact Mana-
ger Harris Hawkins at the Delta
Tau Delta house for transporta-
tion to Alcoma Country club.

Kramer and Seybold showed ﬂashes
of the form which boosted them in-
to club championships in outside
competition.

Most promising of new Pitt pros-
pects is sophomore Harry Simpson,
last year runner-up in the Penn-
sylvania State amateur tournament.

Besides Simpson, two members
of last year’s squad and a trio of
newcomers are ﬁghting for the po-
sitions left open by the graduation
of Bill Reilly, Jim Kennedy, Larry
Geyer, and Homer McClintock.

Seniors Jack Glenn and James
Reese both saw varsity action last
year, while James Butcher, Bob
Jones, and George Gleason have
had golﬁng experience.

Independents, Engineers

Threaten Greek Marks

Everything is in readiness for
the belated all-campus swimming
meet tomorrow afternoon at 5
o'clock in the Trees pool. Some
30 swimmers, chosen because of
their outstanding aquatic ability
from the ranks of the fraternities,
independents, and engineers, have
qualiﬁed for the meet.

Of the nine events, probably the
most heated battle will be seen in
the 120-yard medley relay. Two
fraternity squads, the Phi Gamma
Deltas with Potter, Bitner, and
Mitchell, and the Pilams with Le-
Vine, Krongold, and Jubelirer will
be competing against a pair of in-
dependent trios comprised of Kur-
ran, Grossman, and Sutnick and
Bilowich, Notaro, and Homnack,
and also against a strong engineer-
ing aggregation of Mosko, Shulness,
and Shank.

The 40-yard breaststroke, the 40-
yard free style, and the 40-yard
backstroke races might produce
several surprises. In the diving bat-
tles, Yolten and Jubelirer are en-
tered for the fraternities, Patter-
son and Shulness for the engineers,
and Notaro and McCafferty for the
independents.

Swimming tor the fraternities in
the 60-yard free style relay are
Mitchell, Campbell, McNeil1, and
Roberts of Phi Gamma Delta and
Hutchinson, Ferris, Defoe, and
Nicholas of the Delta Tau Delta
house. These fellows will be get-
ting some tough competition from
the independent quartet of Hom-
nack, Rapaport, Petrone and Don-
ahue.

the PiKA’s and the Phi Gams each
have a squad entered. They will
199 C0mDet1I1g against a quartet of
independent swimmers comprised
of Mason, Donahue, Notaro, and
Sutnick. The engineers have not
entered a team for this event.

Considering the comparative
strength of the teams entered, it
looks as though the fraternities will
probably take the all-campus swim-
ming trophy for the fourth consec-
utive year. But the independents
this year show a much improved
group of swimmers and might score
an upset over the Greeks.

The Pitt News‘

Town Meeting
To Hear Geise

011. Germany

Historian to Analyze

Lower Middle Class

The role of Germany’s lower
middle class in the Nazi revolution
and the higher strategy employed
by the Nazi party will be analyzed
by Dr. John J. Geise, assistant pro-
fessor of history, at today’s Pitt
Town meeting at 2:30 o'clock in
244 Cathedral.

Dr. Geise, author of “l\’Ian and
the Western World,” history text-
book, will discuss Naziism from the
standpoint of a revolution, a social
revolution of the German people.

Explaining this method of treat-
ment, *Dr.. Geise stated. “I will talk

about the one aspect of Naziism that
is overlooked today—-that Naziism
represents a social revolution.”
Hitler and Napoleon

Developing this aspect further,
Dr. Geise will indicate the parallel
.between Napoleon's use of the
‘French Revolution as a weapon to
seize power and Hitler’s use of the
.late German revolution for the
same purpose.

Asked for his opinion of Adolph

A Hitler, Dr. Geise stated that he was

‘undoubtedly a great man in the
technical sense of the word, but
added that Hitler is great only be-
cause of the time and circumstances
in which he found himself, namely,
in Germany following the Treaty of
Versailles and in the midst of a so-
cial upheaval. “Napoleon was a
great man for much the same
reason,” says Dr. Geise.

Middle Class Support

In his talk’ before Pitt Town
meeting, Dr. Geise will show that
the main reason for Hitler’s success
is that he depends on the lower
middle class for his general person-
nel, meaning the main body of sup-
port.

Whether Naziism is peculiar to
the German people or whether any
given people in similar circum-
stances would necessarily turn to
totalitarian fascism, Dr. Geise does
not say. “Ignoramus, we do not
know,” said Dr. Geise, “I am a his-
torian, and as such I can not say.”

Dr. Geise came to the University
in 1924, having graduated from
Penn State, and took his advanced
degrees here. He also attended Co-
lumbia university and has done re-
search at the British museum.

10 ROTC Men

eye nine out of ten times, ten ROTC

ing University award for marks-
manship, the expert riﬂeman badge.

Eight of the ten who have scored
at least 360 hits in 400 attempt as

sity inter-collegiate matches will be
awarded to Brides, Brown, Cengia,
Dickinson, Haywood, Heibling,

HENRIK DAM
vitamin speaker

Dam to Speak

For Assembly
0f Scientists

Dr. Henrik Dam, discoverer of
the vitamin necessary for normal
blood clotting, will lecture in Fos-
ter memorial tomorrow evening at
8 o’clock before an assemblage of
medical and research groups.

Famous for his research on vita-
mins and sterols, Dr. Dam will de-
liver his address, “Vitamin K, Its
Signiﬁcance in Medical Practice
and in Research,” especially promi-
nent because of its relation to re-
cent advances in clinical medicine
dealing with hemorrhage and be-
cause of new leads that have been
opened in basic research ﬁelds.

The A m e r i c a n—Scandinavian
foundation is sponsoring the United
States lecture tour of Dr. Dam, as-
sociate professor of biochemistry at
the University of Copenhagen since
1929.

Vitamin K research has enabled
physicians to better the control of
hemorrhage in the new-born child
and in certain types of surgical
cases, besides providing a new tool
for the biochemist and physiologist
in their efforts to gain a better pic-
ture of liver and blood functions.

New-born children, deﬁcient in
vitamin K, often exhibit a tendency
to bleed internally, in the brain or
intestinal tract, which may be fatal.

Results of tests performed on the
new-born can determine whether
it is deﬁcient in the vitamin and, if
lacking in the blood clotting aid,
an injection into the muscle of the
arm can restore the vitamin K.

If the deﬁciency is discovered in
the pregnant mother, the necessary

injection will insure adequate vita-
min K in the child.

Monfort Jones to Address

Association of Bankers

Montfort Jones, professor of
ﬁnance, will speak Thursday be-
fore the annual dinner meeting of
Th9_ Vlryoming County Bankers ‘IS-
sociation in Arcade, N. Y. The text
Of his Speech will concern “Some
Financial Aspects of Defense.”
