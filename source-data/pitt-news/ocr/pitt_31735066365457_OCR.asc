. The General State Author-
ity approved ‘Wednesday a

.. plan ‘for Phase I of the Uni-

versity’s Forbes building pro-
gram that won the okay of
the University, the commun-
ity, and the city, who were at

.odds until Thursday.

The ‘new plan calls for the
construction of a Law School

.on the site currently occupied

by the Civic Center Motel and
the Humble Gas Station and a

--School of Education-Social Sci-

ences complex- in the Forbes
Field section parallel to Sennott
Street. ’

Exultant, Kim Fellner, a mem-

ber of People’s Oakland, termed‘
_ the GSA decision “tremendous”

and “a victory” for People’s Oak-

‘ land.

For months, People’s
land, an amorphous group of
Oakland residents,’ crusaded

' ‘against the’ University’s propos- ~

ed Phase I plan, which would
have entailed the closing of
Sennott Street and a portion of
Bouquet Street and which would
have represented. an "unecono-
mical”use of land. ,

Oak— '

-H.

Besieged by People's Oak-
land. the University agreed July
28 to suspend its original.plans
and to begin a joint planning
process with the community.
Since then. architects represent-
ing the University, the com-
munity, and the city met at
"technical’_’ meetings in an
attempt to sketch a Phase I plan
acceptable to allnthree groups.
Such a plan emerged at the
sixth such meeting. .

Ground Floors

Although. in Fellner‘s words.
"the mai_n issue is now resolv-
ed,” two bones of contention
remain:

1) provisions -for community
use of the Phase I facilities;
and » ‘_

2) mechanisms for joint plan-
ning between the University and
the community. ~

People’s.Oakland believes the 1

ground floors of the Phase I

buildings should be set aside for

joint community-university use.

Chancellor Wesley' Posvar em-
phasizes that buildings funded by
the GSA must. serve academic

_ purposes.

Countering Posvar. _Fellner

. and

argues that People’s Oakland’s
proposal for the use of the
ground floors could be consid-
ered under the rubric of aca-
demia. A Youth Center on the
ground floor of the School of
Education and a Legal Services
Center on the ground floor of
the Law School would admit-
tedly serve‘ the community but
also offer the respective Schools
laboratories where their students
could put theories to practice.
Fellner maintains.

For his part. Posvar merely
says" that the’ University is pre-

available to the community
when they are not being other-
wise employed. '

How Joint IsJoint?.

Peopleis Oakland and the
University also disagree on the
nature of the joint planning
which both say is necessary.

Fellner insists that People’s
Oakland will settle for nothing
less than “a legally established
body” with both the University
the community having
“veto power” over development
plans.

Posvar, in contrast. is inclin-
ed toward establishing a Com-

- munity Advisory Board and" has

  
 
 
 

 
    

umvg}zsrr¥'
rrrrssu aw

 

instructed his staff to draw up
plans for such a Board.

Thus, though the main issue
may be resolved, other issues
remain.

Still to be decided is whether
the University will make a mone-
tary donation to the city of
Pittsburgh, assuming the city
permits the University to build
the Law School on the site
designed by the GSA.

That site is outside the Uni-
versity‘s December 4, 1970
boundaries and no tax-exempt
institution can build on that
site, as a result of an edict is-
sued by Mayor Peter Flaherty. V

Reluctant to see city land
taken off the tax rolls, Flaherty
has forbidden expansion of tax-
exempt institutions unless ar-
rangements are made for pay-
ments in lieu of taxes.

Chancellor Posvar has indi-

cated that he cannot‘ "legally”‘

contribute state funds to .the
city, and says he ’can’t differen-
tiate between University money

by HEIDI LEVIN

The Constitutional Review Committee tentatively agreed Tues-
day that a nine-person board elected from the student body should
form the structured basis of a new student government.

Members of the Committee, which will eventually propose a
new constitution to the student body. informally decided that an
allocations, committee should be retained and that a “watch-dog"
committee to oversee all organizational planning and activity
should be established. ‘

The proposed constitution would also try to guarantee student
representation on University councils and the University Senate.
The Committee agreed that such membership would provide students
with more representation in the University decision-making pro-
cess. I

The Committee planned to further develop this structure at its
next meeting. Committee member Jan Miller agreed to contact
General Studies Cabinet Chairman Gordon Percy to get input from
General Studies on Constitutional questions.

Currently. there are no General Studies representatives on the
committee. nor have there been such representatives at any of the
Committees meetings thus far. -

The Committee's business Tuesday was briefly interrupted by
the surprise appearance of Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

Posvar said he was “very supportive and sympathetic” of the

Committee’s work, which he feels is “of crucial importance” to
the University. .

The Chancellor stressed the Committee’s responsibility to clear-

- lydefine channels of authority within a revised Constitution. Accord-

ing‘ to~Posvar. the present -Constitution provides no such syst_em.of

Pitt News -survey

Colder rooms faze few

by STEVE LUBE TSKY

Though the temperature in
some University buildings, has
been lowered to 65-68 degrees.
few students polled in an infor-
mal Pitt News survey said they
were aware of the difference.

Those who have observed a
difference indicated that the

most pronounced effect has been

in the Cathedral.

“I was sitting in my Herman
Hesse class at nine o’clock in
the morning, and it was freez-
ing,” remarked one student. “If
I had worn my coat and gloves,
I would have been too warm,
so Ijust sat there and froze.”

A. secretary who works in the
Cathedral noted that "the main
floor is freezing, and the ground
t'loor is cold. The offices aren’t

that bad yet, but I'm still
waiting. ”
Charlie Smith, a first-year

Law student, said that he’s no-
ticed ‘the cold in “some parts
of. the Cathedral and the fifth
floor library.” He hasn’t been
inconvenienced, though, since
he goes “to Hillman where it’s
warmers”

One student finds the Cathed-
ral “chillier in the morning. I

have to wear a coat in class.,”’

Referring also to Langley Hall,
he complained that “they have

the blower going. I sat next to’

it this morning, and I was freez-
ing.”

His friend said that the effect
of the coal shortage has made
his grades suffer.

"It hurts my’ concentration in
an exam,” he muttered.

Other interviewees
ed the situation an improve-
ment. One student maintained
that in the Cathedral “some
rooms are more comfortable."

Another said that “it‘s better

consider-

‘because it’s usually too hot. es-

pecially in the Cathedral."

women union meeting

A by KATHY McCANN

Action marked the initial meeting of the Undergraduate Wo-
men’s meeting Wednesday.

Forty undergraduate women planned to rally.at the Student
Health Center this morning to demand the continuation of_gyne-
cological services. The services have been suspended indefinitely
due to a cut in the center‘s budget.

The group was spurred to action by Jan Miller who said that,
“If we don’t act immediately then this is not an action oriented

The Undergraduate Women’s Union (UWU) rose, according to

one of its founders. Pepper Bulick. “from‘a feeling of basic need
among undergradwomen.

t “In the past.” she said, "if we approached the administration
and said ‘we want to do this’, they’d look at the two of us and
ask, ‘Do you represent undergraduate women?’ ” '

Its‘ organizers 'maintain that the UWU will be a representa-
tive organization attuned to the wishes of its constituency.

“The women’s organizations on campus,‘ said group spokes-
woman Ellen Ganley, “deal mainly with programming and don’t
consider more important things—like lobbying through the adminis-
tration to effect institutional change on behalf of all undergradu-
ate women. We are completely open—we’ll work for anything under-
graduate women feel they need.” '

The UWU also intends to concern itself with services, griev-
ances, and the dissemination of information. In doing so, the group
hopes to benefit from the groundwork in research .of the Advisory
Council on Women’s Opportunities and the University Committee
for Women’s Rights.

One of the problems the group plans to deal with is the psychi-
atric help at the Health Center.

“Since all the psychiatrists are Freudian, the help they offer
doesn't do much good for women students," Ganley asserted.

“Women,” Ganley added, “are also at a disadvantage at the
Placement Center. They bring in recruiters mainly in the field of
natural sciences. Social science fields are not represented.”

“Many interviewers blatantly refuse to admit women to’. their
programs,” alleged union member Gail Hornstein. “I’m only asking
that he (the director of the Placement Service) stop breaking the
law. The University is a legal institution and cannot have ‘any soli-
citors on campus unless they are equal opportunity employers.”

In order to provide day care for childreri”'6f“'women students,
the UWU wants to devise a system in cooperation with the School
of Education whereby students could receive credits for working in
the center. - ‘ ’ ‘ I ” ~ 

A task force was organized at the meeting to delve into the
issue of bylaws. I

“No one person'in the Union will wield all the power,” Gan-
ley stated. “Each active member will have a vote on the Union’s’
structure and amendments, and the voting mechanisms are design-
ed to preclude interest group voting.” ~ '

Ganley said all women undergraduates are members of the
UWU. whether they choose to be active or not.

Voucher system possible

Politicos scan state aid

by GLENDA MINSHULL

The Pennsylvania Legislature
is taking a harder look at aid to
higher education and as a result.
students and administration can

expect policy changes. said Clif-

ford Jones.
chairman.

Jones and Jim Kelley, Repre-
sentative of the State Legisla-
ture. appeared at an informal dis-
cussion with students and admin-
istration Wednesday to answer
questions concerning state aid .to
education. State Senator Ed How-
ard, also scheduled to appear. was
unable to attend due to illness.

Jones, in sketching the back-
ground of the issue, pointed out
that 60 per cent of the present
budget ($3.2 billion) is being
spent foreducation and that David
Kurtzman, State Secretary of Ed-
ucation, has projected a $5'billion
budget for education in five years.

Republican state

“The income tax rate would
have to double just to meet this $5
billion figure,” he said. “There is
strong feeling in the -Legislature
that we are going to have to cut
back somewhere.”

As a result, he said, the state is
re-evaluating educational funding
and looking at more efficient pro-
grams to insure the most for ev-
ery dollarspent.

A possible solution to the prob-
lem is the voucher system which
has been instituted on the primary
and secondary educational levels.

'By directly subsidizing the stu-
dent, rather than the institution,
the voucher system allows the
student more flexibility in choos-
ing his-own school. In effect, the
student becomes a consumer
seeking the ‘best return for his
educational dollar.

"However, all capital (expendi-

‘ tures -would have. to be financed

through state funding." Jones
said.

The present scholarship and
loan program came under strong
criticism by both officials. Only
$60 million of the total education
budget is assigned to the Pennsyl-
vania Higher Educational Assis-
tance Agency (PHEAA), accord-

ing to Kelley. He said that the bas-
is of distribution should be reex-
amined.

“Whatis a scholarship for?.To
encourage scholarship. It should
be a reward from the state to the
student in the hope. that after
graduation the student will stay in
Pennsylvania and make a contri-
bution to the state. I don’t- have
any figures on this, but I’m sure
that very few graduates stay .in
Pennsylvania,” said Kelley.

He ‘also questioned by the
amount of money given to stu-
dents attending out of state insti-
tutions, cla'iming that Pennsyl-
vania taxpayers are subsidizing
other schools as a result.

Jones emphasized the need to .

subsidize" technical and sub-col-
lege schools to meet the needs of
those seeking other alternatives
to a college education.

PENNSYLVANIA TUITION
FOR NON-RESIDENTS
Responding to a question about
in-state tuition rates for out of
state residents, Kelley said that
the court would have to examine

the relationship between a domi— ~

cilliary of a state and a resident
of a state.
not

Voting does necessarily

make a person a domicilliary with _

all the rights of a resident. he
said. Other factors. such as

where he keeps his bank account ‘

and drivers license, must be taken
into consideration in determining
residency, said Kelley.

Jones hinted at a possible tui-
tion hike triggered by the State
Legislature, if the courts grant

residency to out of state students,_

saying that the Legislature might
choose not to subsidize tuition.

“There is a tremendous Legis-
lative revolt and there will be a
tendency to penalize. all students
through a tuition hike,” he said.

Commenting on Governor
Shapp-‘s recent proposal to have
the federal government fund the
educational system as it present-
ly picks up the tab for the high-
way program, Jones said. “It
won’t work. Shapp can‘t expect
the federal government to foot

the bill—it-would undoubtably mean
more ..control—and we already
have enough of that."

Both officials see the scaled tui— ‘

tion plan as a possible plan to re-
lieve present inequities in the
system.

, Mi(lter111s halt a

impeachment

The petition to impeach the Stu-
dent Association Commissioners
and members of the Social Com-
mission remains in a state of lim-
bo.

No formal action has yet been
taken. although the petitioners

claimed weeks ago they had g'arn- _
- ered the required number of sig-

natures specified by the Student
Association Constitution.

One of the students circulating
the petition remarked that the
‘administration had informed
them that “we must have definite
proof of all accusations before the
petition could be submitted."

He said that progress has been
further slowed by mid-term
exams. “We’re not a bunch of ac-
tivists,” he said. “I’m not in
business to dump student govern-
ments; I’m here to become a
chemist.”

In the past. the development of comparative programs attending :5
have been emphasized. However. according to Dr. Stephen 'Blank.'7_'

ope have been neglected.
"It is high time that this oversight be rectified,” asserted Blank.

Since its initiation in the Winter Term, 1971, the interdisciplinary,
program has offered the undergraduate participant an agenda consist’-.
ing of a combination of the social sciences, French language, litera-
ture, and civilization studies. Thus the student is enabled to consider "
the French experience from the viewpoint of more than one discipline.

Graduates of the program should be well prepared for internation- 

any of several disciplines, or in interdisciplinary programs.

According to Blank. co-organizer of the program, considerable
interest has been shown regarding comparable programs by the Span-'
ish. German. and Italian Departments. '

In the light of such widespread interest, it appears conceivable that

He crushed the sputtering

for another box of cigarettes.
"When I came here in Decem-
ber of 1968 I was charged with
changing the entire organiza-
tion of» the Institution. It was
then almost completely security
oriented. I was to bring about
a humane treatment program."

Brierley explained that -_his
first move. ,made two days after
he took office, was to change the
visiting rules. "I saw we had
an open visiting room—that is,

'll0 SCI‘€€IlS OI‘ f€I‘lC€S'—bl.lt I'l0

visitors.” The rules gave a pris-
oner one 1-hour. visit per month
and no visits on Sundays and
Holidays. "I asked the guard
at the desk why it was like this
and he said that this is the way
it has always been."-

The Warden turned toward
the window. sucking his cigar-
ette. "Now does that make
sense—an open visiting room and
novisitors_?" . .

Brierley changed the rules.

Inmates are now permitted at

least three visits per month with
no time limit. "A man may also
request and usually receive addi-
tional visits if need warrants,”
the Warden added. ‘

This change in rules was the
first of-a number of similar
changes and new programs
brought by Brierley to remove
the "little nuisances” of prison
life; men are no longer locked

club, that plays tournaments out-
side, the prison walls. night bas-
ketball and other recreation is

available. and certain ylifers. on
occasion. have had picnics with
their family on the prison front
lawn. .

To many men these changes
portend a better life——" a better.
more humane prison system.“
To many others. these grants
are "just lollypops; pacifiers to
keep. the inmates quiet and .
theprison calm.”

"Sure." one lifer said.iwho has
lived behind the Wall for 16
years. "sure man. Brierley

‘ has improved the ‘prison over the

past regimes. But you know. like’

they’re just something to get

Someprison officials also dis-

a certain contempt for the li_ber—

The Sargeant sat behind his-
desk. licking envelopes with a
slow. deliberate swoop of the
tongue. “Is this a penitentiary?”

The Warden sat. quiet. in the

looks tired. "We do have in-

Two offices robbed,

Recently, there have been several thefts of of-
fice equipment and personal items from offices in

the Student Union.

A typewriter, an adding machine, and a calcu-
lator were stolen from the Student Activities office
on the first floor, and a tape recorder and radio
were stolen from the Student Association office on

the third floor.

There has been no vandalism and no specific

papers stolen from either office.

Bill Markus, director of Student Affairs, said
that in two out of three instances “the doors were
not damaged nor the locks 'tampered with” for the

theft.

“Apparently whoever it was had a key to the
office,” he said.

“Twin Coaches gets

Having seen all the shows at
‘Brier Hill, Calderone thought of a
dinner-theatre at Twin Coaches
and Farr and Melville was the
team she wanted.

The young 'team’s Brier Hill
Playhouse has celebrated this
summer avmost encouraging first
season. After two summers in
Brownsville, Pa., as the Browns-
ville Summer Playhouse, success
seems to be getting a little nearer
for the Playhouse.

This year nearly every perform-
ance on their all-musical calendar
was a sell-out.

"So," says Farr, "instead of
going back to New York this win-
ter, Lee and I will devote our time
to presenting the best possible
mus'.ic:al theatre at the Twin
Coaches and setting up our sea-
son for next summer at Brier Hill
which we plan to open May 17 and
run an all-musical summer sea-
son, for 20 weeks, through Oct.
1.”

Man of La Mancha at the Twin
Coaches Dinner Theatre will star
Gary Farr, recreating his role
from this past summer. He can
be seen in a major film to be re-
leased later this year.

Maazel tricks audience
F

with podium gymnastics

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

Musical London visited Pitts-
burgh this past week with both
good and bad results, as the New
iPhilharmon'ic~ Orchestra and con-
ductoraLorin Maazel continued
their concert tour of this country
with a Tuesday evening perform-
ance at Heinz Hall.

European orchestras such as
this one draw crowds with little
difficulty, even when ticket prices
are exorbitant; the packed house
on Tuesday testified to that. I do
not really know whether the crowd
was present because of the con-
ductor or the orchestra. Having

.1‘ heard this orchestra under Otto

A ' Klemperer.

my curiosity was
aroused as to just how Maazel
would handle this group.

Maazel, whose career can be
described as both prodigious and
prestigious, is no stranger to our
city. He attended the University
of Pittsburgh, played violin in the
symphony here, and served as its
apprentice conductor in the early
fifties.

Now, he not only conducts the
Philharmonic‘ but the Berlin
Radio Symphony as well. In addi-
tion, he was recently chosen as
the new musical director of the
Cleveland Orchestra, an appoint-
ment which surprised everyone,
especially the members of the

'* Cleveland Orchestra.

The beginning of the program,
surprisingly devoid of the British
national anthem, opened with a

Maazel specialty. the Sibelius
Seventh Symphony. Cast in one
movement. it broadly flows on

like some placid Finnish river in _

which its composer may have
found its inspiration.

Maazel is an exciting conductor
to watch. especially while wit-
nessing his podium gymnastics in
a work such as Bartok’s Miracul-
ous Suite. It is quite easy to un-
derstand why he used no score the
entire evening. When could he
possibly have found the time to
look at one as he jumped, knelt,
and genuflected before his orches-
tra? Hisiperformance may have
been exciting but it was terribly
distracting for the audience.

Following intermission, Delis’
Paris was given a thoughtful read-
ing. Unfortunately, this was not
quite enough to make this rather
worn work palatable. Its heavily
romanticized 19th century nature
makes it rather old-fashioned
and, to be quite frank, rather bor-
ing. Certainly there is a countless
number of better English com-
positions for an English orchestra
of this stature to perform.

Strauss’ Till Eulenspiegel and a
standing ovation for Maazel and
his musicians brought the evening‘
to a humorous conclusign._ly_I_a_1azel, i
just as the Till, beautifully
"tricked” the audience by his
showmanship rather than con-
vince them of his musicianship.

Recorded boredom

Pink Floyd: one of a dying breed  

by WILLIAM M. SMITH

A musician friend of mine.when
asked how he would categorize
Pink Floyd. replied with a rather
disgusted shrug. "They are a

. mood group. a bad one. that jams

a lot and depends on sound ef-
fects." -\

Well, Pink Floyd has a new al-
bum out on the Harvest label en-
titled Meddle which is (Guess
what‘? You're right?). filled with
jams and sound effects.

I personally found myself ac-
tually comfortable in listening to
several of the songs. This was a
pleasant change from the strug-
gle one must go through to enter
the cosmic realm of perception
wherein lies the key to under-
standing the outlook, and inter-
preting the gibberish, found on
their previous albums.

The first cut on side one, "One
of These Days,” is a psychedelic
jam, butione which contains a
more definitive quality than those
found on earlier albums.

Roger \-Vater’s bass remains
anchoring
the energized guitar of David Gil-
mour which is consistently strain-
ing to break free.

This perfectly balanced strug-
gle is propelled onward by Rick
Wright’s “Telstar” organ spurts,
all of which create an intensely
charged emotion in the listener.

“An allegorical satire of our present-day world.
A panorama of decadence. It is a science fiction
film projected into the past, not the future. A
journey into the unknown.”—FELLINI

Friday, November 12, 1971--THE PITT NEWS—Page 7

"Fearless is an inept attempt
at artfully blending Eastern and
Western music. The only Oriental
technique employed in the use of
the drone accompanied in the
background by a choral "Aum“
chant which turns into a yawn by
the time the tune has concluded.

A light 305 jazz feel permeates
"San Tropez." and some pleasing
subtle guitar embellishments are
present, making this the most
delightful tune on the album.

The group then slides down
home in their last cut on this side
entitled “Seamus,” showing how
a spaced-out English R-and-‘R
band can be just as adept at
mouthing back-porch blues as
they are at supplying gaping heads
with cosmic drivel.‘

Pink Floyd is well-known for
their heavy reliance upon sound
effects. a recurring motif being

" animal noises.

In "Grant Chester Meadows"
on the Umma Gumma album. they
use bird sounds in the background
to reinforce the attempt at pro-
jecting a serene mental picture
into the listener. The actual voice
of Seamus the dog is used as an
intrinsic part in the technical
composition of the music. '

The entire second side of this
album is taken up with 23 minutes

and 31 seconds of recorded bore-—

dom. This boredom has been
named “Echoes.” I don’t know if
the band was aware of it at the
time, but they couldn’t have chos-
en a more fitting title.

Echoes. it is, of the past. Echoes
of reverberating screams of trap-
ped trips frustrated in their at-
tempts to break free from the
graveyard of psychedelia.

Here they prove themselves still
to be one of dying breed of under-
ground rock bands. I think per-
haps this production shows they
should be makingisound effects
for Japanese horror flicks. Por-
tions of this particular cut would
have been great accompanying-
Rodan on his flights over Tokyo.

If they could see fit to burying
the spirit which pervades side
two in this appropriate gravesite,
then perhaps the budding ele-
ments exhibited in the few cuts
between would be allowed to grow
into a more musically tasteful
Pink Floyd.

ll  Let's Get It Straight

1 nmrv nouns  

While traveling in the north of Italy, a man stayed at an

7 inn where the floor was very dirty. “I was about to ask the

\ -V landlady to scrub it,” he said,
made of mud, and that the more she scrubbed it the worse

code of morality, forgetting

.—“until I realized that it was

ly..unacceptable to God, while
the poor person who sacri-
fices a dollar out of ’love -to .
God and man is accepted of A
Him. The motive makes all
the difference. But how to
acquire right motives?

God has made provision
for this by sending His Son,
Jesus Christ, into the world
to die on the cross, pay_ for
your sins, and set you free
from their penalty, which is
spiritual death. If you will
accept His sacrifice in your
behalf, and receive Him as
your Saviour, you will be born
anew. Then it will no longer
be a matter of scrubbing a
mud floor, but of possessing
a floor of an entirely differ-
ent nature, that can be
cleansed daily by the grace
of God. He offers you this
exchange right .now. '- Will
you accept ittoday?

[ Coach Leo Bemis feels that
I ,-_;;~«..the winner of tomorrow’s Penn
"“”“State (6-2-1) - Pitt (7-2-2) soc-
cer match will be the one that
will go to the N.C.A.A. playoffs.

‘*1 would say that Penn, New-

ark and Delaware are in for sure
with the fourth and final spot
up-for grabs among St. Joseph’s,

3 Penn State and us,” states Bemis.
i All three of the contenders for

the final playoff spot in this
region have two losses. However
St. Joseph's has,_according to

Bemis, “a light schedule, in
‘ comparison to the other conten-
ders.”

 To win the booters will have
 to control State’s" highly» explo-
5 sive offense which includes
; T Andy Rymarczuk (10 goals),
E €"*Chris Bahr (8) and Rick Allen
i (6)., Rymarczuk was State’s
i leading scorer last year while
E Bahr was a high school All-
} American at Neshaminy where
 his father, Walt coached him.

The elder Bahr, who now coaches
F at Temple, was repaid last
E week for his excellent coaching
; efforts by three goals by his son
- as Penn State tore Temple apart
9-0.

Allen is also an outstanding
athlete from Neshaminy who
not only plays soccer but is
iv ‘ also a ‘sprinter for the track

I so fast that at three quarters
I speed he can outrun our full-
backs "while still maintaining
complete control
- /91, He’s tough and hard to stop.”
The wily mentor rates the
entire team as ."very ‘explosive
with excellent speed, and solid
[ at all positions except for pos-
v sibly left fullback." Bemis
- scouted State several weeks ago
I  in their 1-0 loss to, West Vir-

Dykes   unfazed v by 3.5   record       

by MARK SIGMON

Kiski Area High School suffer-
ed only five football losses dur-
ing Jack Dykes’_last two years
there. Already ‘at Pitt, as his
gridiron career draws to a close,
the Panthers have appeared on
the short end sixteen times in
three seasons (1969-71). Never-
theless, Dykes, speaking for him-
self and his teammates, rejects
the notion that the ‘Cats are
downon themselves.

”i know that I play the best
I can all the time,” explained

Dykes. “Everything happens so"

fast in'a game. I know~»ever‘y-
body is trying 100 percent. It’s
justwhen our guys start guess-
ing thatwe get burned.

“This certainly has been a dis-
appointing season for me. Mis-
takes have cost us several ball-

’ games,

.“I want to emphasize that our
losing record has not been be-
cause of the ‘coaches’ fault. In-
dividual errors have killed us all
year?’

Jack refused to put the blame
on any particular person. admit-
ting that every player had flop-
ped at one time or another this
season. On the other hand. he
did stress that with thelarge
number of starting sophomores.
"there has been a lot of learn-
ing on the job. and although
they’re fine players. inexperi-
ence has occasionally caught up
with them." - 1

After an outstanding season
at defensive end last year, Dykes‘
is now the middle guard (“nose-_
man”) in Pitt"s new” 5-2 defen-
sive-'ali_gnment.. The’ transition-

“It’s a lot different,” remark-
ed Dykes. “It’s not really more
responsibility, just a lot more
physical. You’re always getting

“Against Syracuse. .16 tore a
muscle in the back of my calf.
It bothered me in the second

half last Saturday._I could not‘

get off the line quick enough.
But a shot of novocaine did the
trick."

One reason for .switching
Dykes from defensive end was
the coaches‘ fear that Jack would

not be able to recover his for—_
_ mer lateral movement.-so essen-

tial for a defensive end. How-
ever. Dykes feels he has regained
his agility and does not worry
about his former knee miseries.-

Along with guard John Simp-

son, Dykes is one of the Cats’
co-captains. Jack believes that
this fact puts him in a some-
what different position.

“As co -.. captain. I feel a cer-
tain amount of pressure. I leave
my leadership duties for the
practice field. You just can't
tell someone’ during a game

that he‘s' not doing hispjob. Our 1

of Pitt’s defensive ends protects

His heart intent on playing pro-

he will have to make it as a

here in the U.S.. I don’t care.

The officials of the race stop-

ber of their finish on their chests.
While Collins was being charted.
Hillman wasn’t stopped soon
enough as far as Collins and Jim
Banner were concerned.

Banner had counted on Collins
to complement both Dave Szabat
and Mike Shurko in the IC4A’s and
the Nationals. Now, Mickey is out
of the picture until indoor track.

For a couple ofreasons. Collins
was let down by the turn of events.

"I was really looking forward
to running in both the lC4A’s and
the Nationals,” he said. But in-
stead. he will now concentrateon
nursing his pierced heel, which
required four stitches.

Mike is only a freshman. Com-
ing out of high school in Easton,
Pa., he was the most sought after
track and cross" country athlete in
the state. Dave Merrick held that
same distinction in Illinois and
chose Pennsylvania University as
his college stomping grounds.

"I would have liked to see what
I could have done against Mer-
rick." imagined Collins. "He was
the top runner in the country last
year."

ly part with his stitches and will
begin a vacation that will end.
when most peoples is due to be-
gin, during the Thanksgiving lay-
off.

Among the least of his problems
now, Collins suffers from a mild
identity crisis. He prefers being

called Mickey, but a lot of people '

call him Mike.

Whatever people call him though.

it is quite evident that the cross
country and track record books at
Pitt will have to cope with the
name Collins for another four
years.

Before the spiking incident on
Friday. Collins was the bright spot
for Pitt. Mickey, Mike had just
run the best time of any Pitt har-
rier this year. He outdistanced

Mike Schurko by seven seconds
and finished five places ahead of
Szabat. Szab_at and Schurko have
been the standouts all year.

While Greg Fredricks and
Charles McGuire were breaking
the Schenley course record by'57
seconds, Collins ran 45 seconds
faster than Jerry Richey had ever
run the course.

Collins attributed the record
breaking times, ten all tolled. in
the Big Four race to the rapid
pace set by Fredricks a_nd Mc-
Guire. Even though he liked the
pace. Collins didn’t like the re-

' sults it was seemingly forming.

With two miles to go in the race,
Collins looked around. himself and
decided it was up to him to avert
the shutout. ‘

“I saw five Penn Staters in
front of me and a couple of them
behind me and I decided I had to
really move,” he said. “A shut-
out would have been humiliating.”

Mickey has made the transition
from high school’s two and a half
mile courses to the larger col-
lege courses very well. Training
has helped him make the switch.

As the distances became longer,”

R»

:-/

Collings found out that he got -

stronger. 7

If Mikekeeps getting stronger
through the remainder of his ca-
reer, he could really form an
identity crisis for himself.

Along with Mickey and Mike,
all-American, national champion,
and great would all be included in
his repertoire of names.

The game last year was a bit-

This year the committee de-

I Writer’s forfeit

Talk about problems! I was stuck with one on Wednes-
day night, the deadline night for today’s edition of the Pitt
News. “Cover an Intramural game at 4 o’clock,” ordered
sports editor Jerry Myers. That’s what I did—or tried to do.

" As soon as I stepped off”, the Campus bus, I was struck
by a chilling blast of wind, which to my chagrin was colder
and stronger than that at the bottom of the hill. Feeling
somewhat like Frosty the Snowman, I began the trek back to
the multipurpose fie'lds.

On the way I met John Smith, an old acquaintance of
mine who was to referee the game. He informed me that two
-dorm teams were playing. I

As I‘ was walking with him, I noticed the progress of
the new road behind Trees Hall, and the fact that there were
only four lonely figures on the entire field.

“What a day for a forfeit game,” I muttered recalling .-

with a grimace that I was responsible for a sports story.

After waiting five minutes for the other team toarrive,
the three referees and the eight Stratford House players pre-
sent decided that the trip up the hill‘ shouldn’t be wasted,
and commenced choosing up sides. _ '

Since there was an odd man they approached me and ask-
ed if I would like to play. I '

Though I usually restrict my sports activities ‘to weekly
Yogi picks, I certainly wasn’t going to waste my trip up the
hill, so I removed my glasses and took the field.

It" was decided that the teams would be the 15 vs the
16 floor with myself on the 15th floor team.

-My team, ineffectual in the air, lost ‘six touchdowns t

Vnone. But we tried up until the very end, ~

Sitting here in the office all funkey smelling from the
game and without a story, I m.ust humbly plead that you,
the reader, will accept this offering: This was what happened

in their linebacking corps. Since
Tom Cahill’s squad employs a
4-4 defense, the four linebackers
are Gary Topping, Chuck Blake-
ley, Tim Pfister, and Pete Bucha.

On offense, the Black. Knights
have several fine running backs,
with Ray Ritacco leading the
pack from his halfback slot. Com-
plementing Ritacco is Bruce
Simpson, the fastest one in the
backfield.

Quarterbacking the Cadets is
sophomore Kingsley Fink, who
Timmons rates asboth “a fine
passer and runner.” Fink earned
the position after an early sea-
son fight with veteran Dick
Atha. ~

“Fink is the better passer of
the two,” admitted Cahill. "And
he came out strong last week
againsi¥==Rutgers.” .

Injury wise, ‘the Cadets are
in very good shape. Cahill
list only center Cliff Volz as
the only starter not able to play.

DePasqua intends on using
both available quarterbacks,

John Hogan and Dave Havern,'

"at Army. The power-I will con-

. tinue to be the Panthers’ main
offensive attack with most of
the runners getting a chance
to move the ball.

 NOTRE DAME defenders combine to bring down sophomore halfback

Stan Ostrowski afterhe caught a John Hogan pass. The play took place in

the 83 yard drive against ND, the only scoring march the

muster.

Although DePasqua says that
the team suffered a lot of
bruises against Notre Dame.
only one starter was injured
severely. Ed Marstellar, sopho-
more cornerback. will be out due
to a knee injury.

Tight and Les Block, who
missed the ND game. may re-
cover enough from an elbow
injury to make the trip.

DePasqua intends to stick
with John Chatman for kickoff
returns. In the past couple of
weeks, Chatman has fumbled
the ball on returns, and the
opposition has recovered-.. '

“He’s the best man we've
got,” affirmed DePasqua. "He’ll
still be in there.” _
