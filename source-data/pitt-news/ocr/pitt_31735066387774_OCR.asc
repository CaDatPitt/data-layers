UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Grant awarded to study needy

By David W. Matta
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
will receive $5 million from the
U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, as one of 22
agencies selected to conduct a
study on improving the quality
of life for low-income families.

The grant will pay for all health
and human service needs of 120
Allegheny County families for
five years, according to Christina
Groark, associate director of Pitt’s
Office of Child Development.

Families in McKees Rocks,-

Clairton and the city’s Terrace
Village housing project will

‘ receive the money through Pitt’s

Office of Child Development.
These areas were selected for the
study because of the many low-
income families who live in these
neighborhoods. I ‘

Nationwide, 4,000 families will
be participating in the study.

Groark said that the project is
possibly the largest HHS study
since the initiation of the Head
Start child—care program 25 years
ago.

“It is an extremely big deal to
the federal government,” said
Groark. “The collaboration in

impressed the federal
government. ”
Many agencies such as social

services agencies in Pittsburgh

and Allegheny County worked I

together to decide how the grant
would be used if it was received.

“Everybody was willing to work
together to use the grant in the
best, most effective way.”

The grant will help alleviate
some of the financial problems of
the families and allow parents to
concentrate on improving the
lives of their children. .

“I think everybody now knows
that everyone tries to do the best
for their children, but other things
get in the way, especially in low-
income families,” said Groark,
adding that it should be fairly
easy to find the 120 families to
participate in the program
because of its format.‘

In order to participate in the
study, families must be expecting
a baby or already have a recently
born baby. The program will
examine the quality of the child’s
development over five years. The
project aims to see if an improved
family’s quality of life will result
in anﬁimproved child’s quality of
life.

Some of the services that will
be provided to the selected

that the university, under terms
of agreement stated in a legal
document, is obligated to uphold

stated that the university’s plans

the proposal was initiated.

It's at winter wonderland A

Mother Nature showed little mercy on the Pittsburgh area this
weekend as a Sunday morning snowstorm dumpedfour inches
of ﬂurries on the city, bringing along biting cold temperatures.

“Temperatures have been between 10 and 20 degrees below
zero most of the weekend, with winds up to 35 miles per hour,”
said Rodney Smith, meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Pittsburgh.

The hardest hit area, according to Smith, was north of
Pittsburgh in the snowbelt, with Crawford and Erie counties
receiving more than a foot of snow.

But the good news, according to Smith, is that the first
substantial snowfall of the winter season is not here to stay.

Winds will also return to normal today, Smith added. “They
should fall to about 10 to 15 mph, from the [weekend] gusts of
20 to 35 mph."

But don’t put away the long johns yet. Smith said that the cold
temperatures “will probably stay below normal for the next few
weeks even though the highs will return to above the freezing
mark probably by Wednesday.” I ’

families are employment
counseling, health care, child-
care services and rehabilitation
services.

This program focuses on the
family as a unit rather than as
individuals in need of separate
care. The HHS Administration
on Children, Youth and Families
awarded $17 million in grants to
22 agencies including Pitt to
perform the studies in their
respective cities. Other agencies
involved in this project include
universities, hospitals, social
service organizations and
government organizations.

One hundred twenty families
will also be selected as a control’
group to make comparisons.
These families will receive a small
compensation every year for the
five years in return for their
participation in the study.

Pitt received $1 million of the
grant on Sept. 30, 1989, and will
be given an additional $1 million
for the next four years. It will also
get another $1.5 million in
matching grants and donations
from local agencies. This money
may not only be used for the 120
families but also for the setting
up of social service programs i.n
the community that are needed
and not available to the families.

“The plans to build a new
dorm violate the integrity of the
agreement,” Law said.

. According to the Nov. 9 issue
of University Times, Pitt may be
forced to take legal action to
modify the terms of the Falk

Thomas Hussey, executive

Good-bye to Gottfried?  

ESPN reported Saturday night that the University of Kentucky
tendered a $600,000 offer to Pitt football coach Mike Gottfried.
No other details were revealed. '

Jerry Claiborne resigned as the Wildcats coach last week.
Gottfried is one of the top candidates to fill the position.

Gottfried was returning from Ireland, where the Panthers
defeated Rutgers 4629 on Saturday in the Emerald Isle Classic

‘II and was unavailable for comment last evening. Gottfried
would not comment on the situation to reporters in Ireland.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazettereported last week that Gottfried’s
agent visited Kentucky and that Gottfried spoke Thursday with —
Ray Oliver, former Pitt strength trainer and conditioner, who
now holds a similar position atKentucky.

‘ The Pitt News reported last week that a source close to the
football team indicated that there was indeed a very good
chance that Gottfried would leave at the conclusion of the
season. The source also indicated that recruiting coordinator

These complaints are based
on two reports released by the

A report, which surveyed 500

the faculty in our sample who
have served at Pitt for 10 or
more years make less than their
counterparts in the public
schools."

The second report, released
two weeks ago, found that

“Nearly a third of Pitt’s full-time

Medicine] are not in the tenure

considered, but the hillside next
to the Falk School was
determined to be the best.

The PTA does not see it that
way. The parents understand
the need for a new dorm, but
maintaining the existence of the
school’s playground remains top
priority. Law stated that the
university has obvious options
and did not do enough research
into these other possibilities,
thereby/neglecting the problems
the new dorm would cause the
Falk School.

“The actions of the university
are a tremendous disillusionment
to the parents and children of
Falk School. The children are
bewildered and cannot

understand why this is
happening. They thought that
they were part of the university,”
Law said.

Law added that having a
residence hall so close to the
children could possibly be too
influential on the students of the
Falk School, who are
considerably younger than the
students at Pitt.

She also said that the behavior
of the administration is not a
good influence on the students
attending the university. “They
should have been up front and
honest and should have done
their ‘homework,’ qualities every
student should possess.”

Law views the problem as
both a legal and moral issue,

concerning the treatment of the
children and the university's
obligation to the Falk agreement.
The parents, many of whom are
faculty members at Pitt, are
prepared to take whatever
measures are necessary to stop
the building plans. If this means
going to court, the PTA is
prepared to do so.

Both sides would like to avoid
taking drastic measures.

Hussey said, “This side is
looking for a compromise, and
I assume their side is also.”

He said he hopes both sides
can work together to find a fair

agreement that would satisfy

both the need for housing and
the parents’ desire to save the
school playground.

National ’I9raz'n boom ’ gives some profs prestigious salaries

Information Network

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. —— William
Glenn, an expert in high-
definition television, finds that
universities covet him like they
would a ‘ golden-armed
quarterback or a 7—footer with a
silky-smooth jump shot.

“I’m constantly getting job
offers — one every two months,
it seems,” said Glenn, one of the
superstar professors suddenly
benefiting from a brain boom on
college campuses.

Even little-known universities
seem willing to fork outup to
$150,000 to academics who will
set up nationally recognized
programs.

The offer that lured Glenn away

from New York Institute of

. Technology came from tiny, state-

run Florida Atlantic University in
Boca Raton. They agreed to pay
him $114,550 to head a high-
definition TV research team.

That means Glenn will pull
down three times the average of
his FAU teaching colleagues.

the warm climate, the university
was aggressive about beefing up
its electrical engineering program,
and they had bright graduate
students to work with,” he said.

The demand for these
professors — who typically teach
business or science —— is growing
as the pool of academics in these
fields declines. The professors
can bring such prestige to a school
that they demand and receive
generous salaries, lighter teaching
loads and state-of—the-art
laboratories.

“What it does when you get
one of these superstars is it creates
instant success in your research
programs,” said Kenneth Klieuer,
dean of the school of science at
Purdue. “You move up almost
overnight into the big leagues.”

“The competition for superstars ~

is so fierce because schools are
trying to go after the same big
talent,” said Robert Rosenzweig,
president of the Association of
American Universities,
representing about 60 elite
research-oriented schools.
College administrators are
recruiting top talent by offering
“packages” that can cost a

university more than $500,000,

The school has said it intends to

build a reputation as a center for

the study of race and gender.
Not all the superstars wind up

at Ivy League—level universities.
The University of South Florida

in Tampa, for example, snared
Shirley and Ting Chu, an
internationally known husband-
wife team of microelectronics
researchers, from Southern
Methodist University. USF paid
them a combined annual $140,000
salary, and put $300,000 into
renovating its electronics
laboratory for them.

“This team has "done some of
the most avant-garde work in the
country in electronics. We went
after them, and we got them,”
said Michael Kovac, engineering
college dean who recruited the
Chus.

But Kovac, like other
administrators, frets about the
loy 'es of purloined profs. What
if nother university dangles a
more attractive package?

“The reality,” he said, “is that
you get superstars and you have
to increase their salary every three
or four years or someone else is
going to come along with a better
offer.”

Administrators at Temple
University share Kovac’s worry.

more than we can afford to pay
them to go somewhere else,” said
Cathy Gossinger, assistant to the
president. “The situation is not
unlike the corporate world, where
[chief executive officers] of
companies are cultivated all the
time by other ﬁrms.”

Indeed, education experts
attribute the intense bidding wars
for top-ﬂight faculty members to
a basic business maxim: supply
and demand.

An unusually high number of
senior faculty members
professors who joined colleges
during America’s Sputnik era of
the 19505 and '60s — are expected

‘ to retire in the next decade. There
will not be enough newly minted
Ph.D.s to replace them.

From 1987 until 1992, there will
be 1.6 candidates available for
every college teaching job,
according to a September study
by the Mellon Foundation.
However, by 1997~2002, there will
be only 50,934 new faculty
members to fill 37,091 expected
vacancies. Hardest—hit ﬁelds: math,
physical sciences, humanities and
social sciences.

“The supply in relation to
demand is tight, so the way some
colleges have balanced that out is
by increasing prices,” said Iris
Molotsky of the American
Association of University
Professors in Washington, a union
that represents faculty members.

The high salaries for superstars

Loadea’ gun law necessary A

Not many people would argue that a little preventive

1 medicine goes a long way. The Pennsylvania chapter of

the National Rifle Association doesn’t subscribe to that
theory, however. ’

Representative Ruth’ Harper, D—Phila., introduced to
the State House in October a bill that would make it a
crime to leave loaded guns within the reach of small
children. Under the proposal, the owner of a gun which
becomes accessible to any child under the age of 18
could face seven years in jail and a fine of up to $15,000

if the use of the weapon by a minor results in injury or
death.

Faced in recent years with gun-control groups wishing
to severely limit existing laws that the NRA favors, it is no

» wonder that Pennsylvania members of the group are not

overjoyed by the possibility of a new law. According to
the NRA, there are 210,000 members in the state. The
organization also said 65 percent of the state's house-
holds have one or more guns. .

’ That’s a large contingent, but even the efforts of the
entire group could not bring back to lifeany one of the
84 children under the age of 15 who have died of gun
accidents in Pennsylvania since 1979. If it’s true that
“Guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” then
removing guns from the reach and use of children would
seem to be a step in the right direction for all parties
involved.

-T he NRA supported the passing of a similar law in
Florida and is backing another proposal in Wisconsin.
According to Alan S. Krug, the NRA’s Pennsylvania field
representative, the Pennsylvania chapter plans to op-

pose the bill because none of the state's members have

voiced support for it.

Perhaps the NRA has the right to feel a bit paranoid._
New legislature calling for more gun-control laws emerges
every day. The Constitution provides that all Americans
have the right to bear arms, and it is to the credit of the
NRA that they are attempting to make that edict stand up.

But this is not the precedence—setting type of case that
could make or break the future of the NRA and its beliefs.
Showing the public that the NRA does care about more
than “guts, guns and God,” might givethem the foothold
they need in the state's and nation’s perceptions.

And save a few lives as well.

Make a difference.

Conservatism given bad name

I could see it coming, but I
wasn’t sure just when the
moment would arrive. For the
majority of this semester, The
Pitt News has featured a fairly
articulate (he uses words like
pertinacious) columnist by the
name of Paul Kengor. Mr. Ken-
gor, who is an avowed cold-
warrior, has brandished his ul-
traconservative guns with a vim
and vigor rarely seen in other

conservative publications. He is .

exceedingly outspoken — a
brash and brave position to be
in, seeing that ultraconserva-~
tism is being increasingly ex-
posed as antiquated reactionari-
anism, and perhaps an even
worse evil than spineless liber-
alism.

His opinions were never too
complex and they tended to
border on the rhetorical. Advo-
cation of red menace fear and
the prediction that the Third
Reich was again around the
European corner [Were] stan-
dard fare. At best, Mr. Kengor’s
presence could have been seen
as a minor counterpoint, and at
least a testament to this nation’s
commitment to the protections
of free thought and speech.

But today is an important day
for Mr. Kengor and, in effect, for
all ofus. With the opening words
of Mr. Kengor’s article, “Com-
mies Abound on Campus,” he
has officially emerged from the
political closet... and further
established himself as czar of
the anti—red brigade, dedicated
to the abolition of the mythical
communist population here at
the University of Pittsburgh.
Extra, Extra, Czar Kengor’s anti-
commie war at Pitt starting to-
day. Tomorrow, no doubt, the
nauon.

I detected a slight tongue-in-
cheek orientation to Mr. Ken-
gor’s article, now proving that I
can recognize a joke. But I'm
not sure how anyone could take
the implications of this article
too lightly. Mr. Kengor, in his
giddy redneck approach to anti-
communism, wished upon this
nation a revival of McCarthyism,

an exhuming of that senator
from Wisconsin’s questionable
spirit in order to vindicate his
legacy as a legitimate response
to the imagined threat of com-
munism within the United States
during the cold war. Unfortu-
nately for Mr. Kengor, Joe

—McCarthy’s crusade was never

legitimate and never will be.
Senator McCarthy could never
get the exact number of card-

carrying communists he had on A

 

his list anyway. The McCarthy

period represents American
government at its paranoid
worst, and the fact remains that
the only contributions Joe
McCarthy left for this country
were the new governmental
ability to manufacture fear at
will and the institutional ten-
dency to squelch legitimate
dissent. The repercussions of
the McCarthy phenomenon are
sadly still being felt today.

It is unsophisticated voices
similar to Mr. Kengor’s that give
conservatism a bad name and
force more reasonably minded
folks to run for cover under
more leftist-leaning camps. The

attitudes like those expressed in '

Mr. Kengor’s column today not
only ignore the dangers of re-
peating history but encourage
ignorance and wanton back-
wardness. As patriotic as Mr.
Kengor’s clarion call may have
sounded, it is, in the end, dan-
gerously knuckleheaded.

So, I will pose a variation on
Mr. Kengor’s desire for a Mc-
Carthyist communist inquisition
and turn it back on himself by
querying, “Are you now, or have
you ever been, a knucklehead?”

As we all nervously listen for

-"the rumblings of Mr. Kengor’s

newly mustered yet terminally
ignorant anti—red brigade, let us
all lament the revelation that Mr.
Kengor is no more than a con-
servative poseur, and that The

Pitt Newshas lost the promise of
a sophisticated conservative
voice to the insidious clutches
of ideological dilettantism.

North Oakland crime wave
The purpose of this letter is
two-fold. First, it is written to

alert members of the university a '-

community who may not be
aware that a serious situation
exists in the North Oakland area,
which is the fact that over the
past several weeks the area has
been plagued by a rash of burgla-
ries, automobile break-ins, van-
dalism and assaults.

Since the area has traditionally

been known as a low-crime neigh- _
borhood, its residents may not be ‘
taking all of their available secu—-

rity precautions, thereby becom-
ing “easy pickins” for thieves and
hooligans. This, unfortunately,
may be attracting the criminal
element_and may ultimately re-
sult in change of the basic nature
of the North Oakland neighbor-
hood. Residents are urged to
examine their habits and living
situations to find if there is more
that they could be doing to pre-
vent a burglary. It may be a
simple matter of closing the front
door of their apartment building.
Things such as secure foyers and
intercom systems are added to
the price of your rent. You pay
for them whether you use them
or not. In fact, you may pay a
much higher price if you don’t

V use them.

The second‘ purpose of this
letter is to call attention to a
petition that urges the reinstate-
ment of police foot-patrolmen to
the North Oakland area for the
purpose of crime deterrence.
There are copies of this petition
inside some apartment buildings
and at some stores such as the
Centre Avenue Newsstand and
the Giant Eagle in North Oakland.
There is also a copy of the peti-
tion at The Pitt News office.

THE prrr NEWS,

Republicans goofed when they nomiated George Bush

After a week and a half of rest
and relaxation, I’ve decided to

come out of retirement to de-«

nounce another one of my for-
mer affiliations —— the Republi-
can Party.

Ever since the Republican
convention in Louisiana back in
August '88, and especially in the
last six months, my reaction to
myformer political party is iden-
tical to that of a high school
cheerleader having to dissect a

. fetal pig —— extreme nausea.

The internal erosion began at
the Republican convention, when
the party nominated George Bush
as itscandidate. I never disliked
Bush; I never thought he was a
wimp,,but much like a second-
rate football game, I just couldn't
get. excited over him. Jack Kemp

I was the man I supported. If Bush
I was the Atlanta Falcons vs. the

Detroit Lions, Kemp was a bare-
breasted women’s roller derby.
Unfortunately, no one else feels
that way.

Okay, so Bush got the nomina-
tion. It could have beenworse -
Al Haig could have been success-
ful; Fortunately for Bush, the
Democratic Party was equally

neanderthal —— they gave the
race for Dukakis to lose. About
three months and a thousand
points of light later, Bush became
our 41st president. The trouble
took off from there.

It's been 12 months or so since
the election, and George Bush is
still looking for ‘something to
include in his “Things I did as
President” term paper that’s due
for his State of the Union ad-
dress. His list will include a
piddling increase in the mini-
mum wage that would ‘send
Scrooge into paroxysmal spasms
of delight, a war on drugs that
seems more like a cap-gun fight
‘and a unifying speech to our

' NATO allies that now reads like

yesterday’s news, mostly because

’ it is. What Bush won’t be brag-

ging about is his failure on the
capital—gains -tax cut, the “save
the ﬂag” ammendment, the Pana-
manian coup fiasco and his ina-
bility to deal with Gorbachev.

, What is happening in eastern
Europe is truly incredible. The
domino theory seems to be hap-
pening in reverse. Poland, East

‘ Germany and Czechoslovakia are

among the countries playing

topsy-turvy with everyone’s Cold-
War scorecard. While it is true
that the United States should not
leap naked into the swimming
pool of Eastern European reform,
embracing every Tom, Dick and
Ivan, neither should it stand back

’offering polite ‘applause and

 

damning with faint praise. The
Soviet Union may still be shifty
and dubious in its true intentions,
but it is safe toassume that the
reforms in the eastern bloc are
not only genuine but also virtu-
ally irreversible. Can you imag-
ine what the world’s reaction
would be if East Germany started
to rebuild the Berlin Wall?

The upcoming “Saltwater Sum-
mit” between Bush and Gor-
bachev is a good first step. Per-
haps a down-to-earth dialogue
between these two leaders will
reduce the number of what

Emmet Tyrrell calls “Gorbasms”
between the Soviet Secretary-
General and the liberal American
press.

However, my disdain for the
Republican Party goes further than
the fumblings and incomplete
passes of quarterback Bush. This
past November, I witnessed two
crucial states, Virginia and New
Jersey, elect Democratic gover-
nors. New York City has also
elected a Democratic mayor for

, the umpteenth time as well. I

have no idea, nor does anyone
really, what kind of leaders newly
elected David Dinkins, Doug
Wilder andjames Florio will turn
out to be. My gripe is not with
them but with the cowardly
campaigns of their respective
opponents — Guiliani, Young
and Courter. All three stumbled
on the same issue —- abortion.

When the campaign started,
these Republicans were all pro-
life. However, when the heat was
turned up, all three men faltered.
Before you could say “political
suicide,” the three would-be lead-

, ers muttered those seven magical

In the future: 'War on Beet‘ replaces ‘War

Face it. Americans love choles-
terol. The more cholesterol that is
in our food, the more we love it.
However, this love affair is not so
good for our arteries and veins.
Based on that knowledge, I was
able to peer into my crystal ball
and make a few predictions for
the near future: I

It is 1993. Congress has just

voted on a constitutional amend-
ment that states, “After one day
from the ratification of this ar-
ticle, the raising, possession, trans-
portation, distribution or sale of
cows or their body parts; the
importationor exportation thereof
from the United States and all
territory subject to their jurisdic-
tion, is hereby prohibited.” Soon
afterward, the states vote their
overwhelming approval of the
new amendment.

Within days of declaring it ille-
gal, the price of beef skyrockets.
Ground chuck is selling for $200

an ounce. Of course, it isn’t sold
in supermarkets. Instead, it is
sold in‘ the underground econ-
omy. Beef pushers hang out on
street corners, waiting to make a
deal. Undercover cops abound,
hoping to make some arrests.
Not having the $700 that it
would cost him to buy a ham-
burger, Joey Smythe decides to
burglarize someone’s house to
get the money. But one ham-

burger isn’t enough —- he wants -

more. He has become _ a ham-

burger junkie. To pay for his

addiction, he and others like him
commit a string of burglaries. .
Housewife Myrna Thompson
is arrested for eating a steak. The
police ask her, “How could you
do such a horrible thing? That
cholesterol could kill you!” Myrna
replies, “It’s my body, and I can
do anything I want to it.”
Meanwhile, the problems are
mounting. Lured by ‘huge proﬁts,

students start selling bologna in
high schools. Ten-year-olds are
pushing meatballs. Gangs fight
over who can control the hot
dog market in their neighbor-
hood. _ l+

 

The president decides that
something must be done. She
declares a “war on cattle.” A beef
czar is appointed to oversee the
war, and the national guard is
called in to help.

But the problems are insur-
mountable. Caught in the cross
fire between two gangs fighting
for control of the beef market,
four innocent bystanders are shot

to death. _

The government institutes a
blood-testing policy. Anybody
found to have a cholesterol level
of 200 or more receives a $10,000
fine and/or one year in jail.

A new “zero tolerance” law

goes into effect. Any vehicle with

even a trace amount of beef in it
will be confiscated by the gov-
ernment. Two weeks later, the
Queen Mary comes into New
York Harbor. A passenger is
found to have a shish kebab in
his suitcase. Thevice president
gets a new boat. ,
It is becoming more and more
dangerous to raise cattle. -Old
Bessie is just too large to hide. So,
instead of raising their own cattle,
many dealers start importing beef
from South America. Others with
good chemistry backgrounds start

creating synthetic beef. The syn- ‘

thetic beef is given the name
China Brown. People who eat it

7

words, “I am personally opposed
to abortion but...”In otherwords,
“I have no guts to take either
side.” These vacillations proved
to be deadly to the candidates.
The pro-choicers sensed a lack
of commitment, and the pro-
lifers feltbetrayed. Evidently, both
sides assumed that they had
nothing to lose by choosing the
Democratic candidate.
that off, Pittsburgh didn’teven
run a Republican mayoral candi-
date to defeat the perennial grand-
mother, Sophie Masloff. The fact
that potential. candidates were
threatened by a woman with the
face of a Disney character and
the voice of a muppet does not
bode well for the emergence of
hard—ball politics in the Steel City.

So last week I-vceremoniously
snipped my Republican National
Committee card in two. In the
meantime, I’ve gone back to my
old haunt ——- the American Apa-
thy Party. We were supposed to
have a meeting yesterday, but it
was cancelled —- no one showed

up.

on Drugs’

never suspect that it isn’t real
beef. As it turns out, thousands of
people have allergic reactions to

- China Brown and die.

An average of three judges are
assassinated by beef lords every
week. The president’s husband

starts a campaign of “Just say no _

to beef!” Congress debates
whether or not to shoot down

planes that are suspected of car— .

rying liver.

After a while, someone by the

name of Wanda B. Free suggests
that beef be made legal. She is
immediately criticized for her
insane idea. “You're crazy!” cries
one person. “Legalizing beef
would destroy our country. You
are a disgrace to society."

Meanwhile, another gunshot is
heard in the distance.

’Dear’ people urge bunters to t/yin/e twice about the sport

Since everyone is always say-
ing how dearl am, I figured it
was about time to defend my
fellow deer in a way that counts.
As the only non—human mem-
ber of The Pitt Newsstaff, I guess
I am the only truly qualiﬁed col-
umnist to write this article. After
all, humans just can’t seem to be
objective when it comes to them-
selves. So, it’s up to me to exam-
ine the phenomenon known as
Deer Season.

As you may have guessed, I am i

pointedly against the whole thing.
It's unfair. Some people have
come up with all kinds of reasons
why this merciless genocide is
supposedly necessary and even
(guffaw) a good thing to do. But
I say they are just rationalizing
themselves into the ground.
Consider the arguments of the
hunter:

1. Hunting is a manly sport.
Wrong. Hockey is a manly sport.
Sneaking around in other deer’s
homes with enough ammo to
blow up the Chrysler building in
order to murder defenseless ani-
mals is hardly manly. I am not
impressed. Is it macho to blow
holes in the heads of your neigh-
bors? Is that a sport? NO! It's just
sick. i

2. Hunting is good for “male
bonding.” Is it? Whatever hap-
pened to poker games and
Monday night football? At ‘least
then you could talk to your
buddies without fear of scaring
off the game. They were also

‘much more pleasant alternatives

to getting up at the crack of
dawn, trudging through the mud
and sitting around for countless
hours waiting for innocent by-
standers to get out in the open.

And I never heard of anyone
accidentally losing an arm (or
worse) over a royal ﬂush.

3. Hunting is necessary to pre-
vent overpopulation. Why? What
are those hunters afraid of? Cor-

 

porate takeovers? Deer aren’t
capitalists. Aside from the ambi-
tious few who have become news
columnists (myself) and depart-
ment store clerks (Deers and
Roebuck), they don’t even hold
jobs. Forget about public office.
They leave that chore to the tur-
keys and the asses. Let’s also

keep in mind that there are natu-
ral predators other than people
— and there are other causes of
deer death, too. (You think green
monkeys have the market_cor-
nered on strange diseases?)

4. Deer are dangerous. (pre-
sumably, to motorists) Yeah, right.
Didn’t any of those hunters ever
see Bambi? Deer are pacifists.
And ﬂexible. They don’t mind
hanging out in game preserves
and‘ zoos. They don’t mind
making room for human houses.
But anyone can be pushed too
far.

5. A doe equals dough. Espe-
cially if the N.R.A. doesn't get its
way and somebody outlaws semi-
automatics for household use. It
seems to me that people could
find much better ways of making
money than killing bucks.

The whole concept of hunting

betrays something very basic/and
primal about the humans who
engage in the practice. They are
violent, and violence begets vio-
lence (Look at what happened to
Jimmy Hoffa.) Whether a person
shoots another person or a deer,
the essentials are the same —
snuffmg o.ut the life of a living
creature. To be able to do that
indicates a lack in moral fiber.

If hunters would only stop to
ask, they would find deer to be
really terriﬁc individuals. And they
really know how to have fun.
(Who do you think invented the
stag party?) Deer are just people
in leather skins, and everybody

knows how dear people can be. I

So I urge all hunters to give deer
a shot at life. Don’t take a shot at
theirs.

Faculty
Continued from page I

That report stated, “Since they
[the faculty] are not eligible for
tenure and have little or_ no
protection against arbitrary
nonrenewal, non-tenure-stream
faculty often do not feel free to

0 voice their opinions, defend their

academic decisions, or seek
improvements in their working
conditions.” V

The faculty» here was
disallowed the right to unionize
in March of 1987 when a hearing
examiner of the State Labor
Board released his finding that

- faculty members are managers

and therefore may not unionize.
Hence, the UF only acts in
collective representation and not
as a bargaining unit with the
university. The decision is

_ presently being appealed.

“We’re not certiﬁed, but we
do do work on behalf of the
entire faculty,” Wion said. “We
help them appeal tenure
decisions and are constantly
active in the University Senate.

“We’re working hard to use
the institutions that exist to make
Pitt a better place.”

Wion charged that the
university is blocking democracy

by not allowing the faculty to

unionize.
“Democracy is coming to
Eastern Europe before it comes

to Pitt,” he said. “If they don’t ,

think we should have a union,
fine. Let them persuade us, and
we’ll persuade them and vote
on it. That’s the democratic way. ”
The hearing examiner’s
findings were based on the 1980
Supreme Court decision in
National Labor Relations Board
125. Yeshiva University which
found that faculty are managers
and, hence, may not unionize.
Pitt University Counsel Lewis

Popper summarized the court's
ruling, “If a person recommends
decisions and those
recommendations are generally
followed, then that person is a
manager.” Under this criteria,
he said, the UP agreed that they
act as managers.

The hearingexaminer’s report
states that the UP and the
administration agreed that “in
the vast majority of instances,
[University Senate]
recommendations are followed
by the administration." The
University Senate is made up of
students and faculty.

The report also explained that
faculty serve on search
committees for new faculty

_ members.

“Service on such search
committees includes

responsibility for advertising the

position, reviewing resumes and
credentials, making initial
screenings, interviewing
candidates, providing written
responses to rejected candidates
and making recommendations
for hiring to the department
chairperson, dean and/or
provost, which with rare
exceptions are followed,” the
report said.

“We say that a manager is
hired to manage and to actually
have the power to make policy,
and that’s something the faculty
here does not have,” Wion said.

He added that since Yeshiva is
a private university, the court’s
ruling should not apply to Pitt
which is a public institution.
“Unless we have legal bargaining
power, we are in a weak place.”

“The general principle of state
labor law is that they follow
federal precedent,” Popper said.
“They don’t have to, but why
fabricate something new out of

_ nowhere.”

Even if the faculty are
managers, why should they not
be allowed to unionize?

“National labor policy says that
it’s inappropriate to have people
who manage your institution
unionized,” Popper said. “It is a
sensible‘ rule for running a
university. You can’t be organized
in a unit set up to beat
management and at the same
time sit at the table with the
president and make policy for
employees.”

Because the faculty cannot be
both management and labor,
Popper added that if the faculty
unionized, the university could
no longer beneﬁt from their
present managerial status in
which they aid in policy making.

“We should have the ‘benefit of
faculty in policy making. We
want them in a shared-
governance mode,” he said.

If the federal statute established
in the Yeshiva decision is applied

a to Pitt, which falls’ under state

jurisdiction, the repercussions on
other state institutions would be
enormous, according to Wion.

“This doesn’t just affect us here
at Pitt. This case will affect the
whole state,” he said.

For instance, he explained that
if the state rules against Pitt, the
faculty union which has existed
at Temple University for the past
15 years would be forced to
disband.

“If we lose, the administration

. at Temple will refuse to bargain

with that union,” he said.

He added that a negative
decision could have terrible
effects on teachers at elementary
secondary schools in
Pennsylvania, which are presently
unionized. He said that the
present trend among teachers of
all grades is to seek a more
professional status by seeking
more responsibility in the school.

Pitt eyes are smilin’ aﬁer 46-29 Ireland victory

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor ,

DUBLIN, Ireland - One complaint many
people from Ireland have about American
football is that it is too slow-paced and
dragged out compared to their version of
football.

But the 19,800 Irish folks that showed
up for the second annual Emerald Isle
Classic on Saturday were treated to an
action-packed, high-scoring football game
USA style, as Pitt defeated Rutgers 46-29.

“It was a game for the quarterbacks.
They both threw real well,” said Rutgers
coach Dick Anderson.

Pitt quarterback Alex Van Pelt, who
threw for 336 yards, and Rutgers
quarterback Scott Erney, who threw for
245 yards, were named game MVP’s for
their respective teams.

In the game's first possession, Van Pelt
connected with Pitt's leading receiver,
Henry Tuten, for two long passes and
Adam Walker rushed for 27 yards, including
an eight—yard touchdown run.

Erney led the Scarlet Knights right back
on their first possession. Erney’s scrambling
style kept the Pitt defense off guard. Erney
threw for 55 yards on his first two attempts.
The Rutgers drive ended with a 43-yard
field goal by Doug Griesler.

With Pitt’s lead down to 7-3, Curvin
Richards took over the game. At the Pitt 46
yard line, Van Pelt faked a handoff to
Richards up the middle, and dumped him
the ball seven yards downﬁeld. A Rutgers
defender hit him hard immediately, but
Richards somehow kept on his feet. He
broke three or four more tackles and
sprinted the rest of the way to the end
zone to put Pitt up 14-3.

“It was lousy tackling all game,” said
Rutgers linebacker Pat Udovich. “ I thought
we were getting position, but every time
we [missed a tacklel.”

Udovich also expressed disappointment

at the outcome of the game. “I think Pitt is

a good team, but I don’t think they are a
great team. We should not have letup that
many points.”

But Rutgers wasn’t going to be outdone
in front of the yelling Irish crowd. Once
again, Erney was the main weapon,
combining his running and passing skills.
The drive was capped off when Rutgers
receiver Randyjackson got behind Alonzo
Hampton and Erney laid in a perfect 24
yard touchdown pass.

Pitt failed to score on its next possession,
marking the first drive without any points.

Rutgers did not follow suit however,
and when James Cann scored from three

yards out, they had a 15-14 lead over the
Panthers.

Not to be outdone, the Panthers roared
back and took the lead once again. Richards
scored on aone yard TD run then added
the two point conversion.

Just three minutes later, Pitt extended
their lead to 29-15. Once again, Richards
put the ball in the end zone on a 15-yard
reception.

“The turning point was probably our
offense,” said Pitt coach Mike Gottfried.
“We controlled the ball and got the two
touchdowns ahead.”

After an Ed Frazier field goal put Pitt
ahead 32-15 early in the second half,
Erney put Rutgers back in the game when
he scored from two yards out.

The game shifted back to Richards, as
he got the call on five of the first six

Wolfpack
for 1st los

By Mike Rampa -
Asst. Sports Editor

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — After
defeating the Oklahoma State
Cowboys Friday evening in the
first round of the Diet Pepsi
Tournament of Champions, Pitt
was beat at its own game Saturday
night by the N.C. State Wolfpack
in the finals.

The Panthers (2-1) and the I
Wolfpack (4-1) played as if they
had adopted each other’s standard

microscope. Page 10

game plan, and as a result, the
Pack handed Pitt its first loss of
the season, 100-87.

On paper, the matchup figured I
to be a problem for N.C. State of
the Atlantic Coast Conference with
the strong, experienced backcourt
of Chris Corchiani and Rodney
Monroe, but nothing proven on
their front line to match the inside
strength of Pitt’s Brian Shorter
and Bobby Martin.

However, the Panthers could

. not feed the ball to Shorter, and
their newly adopted “run and
gun” offense wore them out in
the stretch.

But the Wolfpack was
successful in all the areas which
Pitt was looking for in its game
plan.

Corchiani and Monroe
combined for 43 points, but more
importantly both were able to
dish assists inside to tournament
MVP Tom Gugliotta (forward)
and center Brian D’Amico, who
proved to be the difference in the
game. '

Gugliotta and D’Amico both

per game last season, but they
combined for 31 against Pitt as

It was more like the North Pole than the North Side.

The winds were snapping through Three Rivers Stadium, and
the snow was ﬂying, whitening the winter hats of those on hand.
Christmas carols played over the loudspeakers. It was winter in
Pittsburgh, Pa., and the Steelers and Houston Oilers were playing
a rather important AFC Central football game.

Reverses and flea-flickers by the Steelers. In the snow? You bet.
No one is quite sure just what goes on in the mind of Pittsburgh
head coach Chuck Noll. He wanted to take advantage of Houston’s
overpursuing defense; that’s the guess here. Seven fumbles by
Houston? Not one less. It was tough operating on that white turf.

Earnest Givins was able to hold .on to this pass despite the elements and the wrestling match at mid-field. The Oilers
defeated the Steelers on a touchdown with 21 second left.

By Thomas Danyluk

The ball was slippery. “The conditions were terrible,” said Steelers
Staff Writer 5

running back Tim Worley.

All sorts of craziness on this particular day. And it was fun,
although the outcome wasn’t for the Steelers. It was one of those
games you’ll always remember, just because it was so visually
stimulating to the eye, like the Steelers vs. Bengals in 1976.

When it was all over, the Steelers’ playoff hopes were the only
thing that could be found melted on the turf of wintry Three Rivers.

Houston nicked the Steelers 23-16 on a one-yard touchdown
dive by Lorenzo White with 0:24 remaining in the game, lifting the
Oilers into sole possession of first place in the AFC Central at 8-
4. The Steelers settled into last at 6-7.

And to be blatantly blunt, it was a game the Steelers bad to win.

Pitts questionable bench cm/zse1‘0r coaching concerns

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

With the loss of Sean Miller,
the basketball team's problem of
bench strength becomes even
more grave as they embark on
the 1989-90 campaign. ,

The Panthers basically play
only six men during the course‘
of a game, and in a season of just
under 30 games, that amount of
playing time can take its toll on
thestarting ﬁve of Brian Shorter,
Bobby Martin, Rod Brookin,

Jason Matthews and Darelle

‘Porter.

In Friday evenings game
against Oklahoma State ‘in the
Diet Pepsi Tournament of
Champions, Pat Cavanaugh,
Darren Morningstar and Gilbert
Johnson all saw playing time off
the bench and alleviated some of
the pressure off of the starting
five. But as to how much they
contributed or will contribute, is
a relative question. _

The trio off the bench posted a
total of 10 points and eight

e rebounds among themselves, and

Moriningstar fouled out after
seeing only 12 minutes of playing
time. 0 P

After the Oklahoma State
contest, Matthewsisaid, “People
try to tell us we don't have any
bench this year, but I think we
proved tonight we have some
bench strength when we need it.

“Gilbert and Darren played well
at times. I think if we need help
off the bench like we did tonight,
we'll be able to come through.”

Gilbert Johnson, at 6’8", could
potentially provide some support
at forward in order to give Shorter
a rest. y

game situations.

“Gi1bert’s a tough kid to coach
because he only practices about
two days» before a game. So he
gives you that little tinge to let
you know he might be able to
help me. I L

“But the first three days [of

practice], you want to kick him
out of the gym,” Evans said.

Brookin was quick to
acknowledge the fact that a limited
bench will be a factor throughout
the season. In his transition from

they consistently beat the Panther
defense in the low post.

“We try to balance the scoring
and we knew we had’ to get some
inside scoring for us to be effective
on the outside too  that was the
key for us,” Gugliotta said.

“I think I was just in the right
place at the right time. The team
found me running the ﬂoor and I
was just getting easy baskets.”

The Panthers have been
advocating their run and gun
offense since the preseason as a
method of opening up scoring
opportunities and also to take
advantage of point guard Darelle
Porter's quickness, but the
Wolfpack ran them right into the
ground. ,

Pitt’s starting ~ ﬁve of Porter,
Martin, Shorter, Jason Matthews
and Rod Brookin averaged 37
;. ﬁinutes on the ﬂoor, and fatigue

took its toll in the second half.

“We just stopped running, ” said

Brookin, a member of the all-
tournament team, sparked by his
24- point performance in the final.

1 , “Our big men could beat their

big men down the court, but in
some cases it wasn’t that way 
we weren’t doing the things in

0 our transition game that we would

have liked to do.” ,
Pitt enjoyed the lead for over
19 minutes of the first half; at one

point as much as a nine—poi_nt
margin. They even closed out the
half » with momentum swinging
their way as Brookin swiped the
ball off of Corchiani and went
coast to coast. for the slam with
no time showing on the clock.

The Panthers went into the locker 1

room with a 49-43 lead.

But N.C. State closed the gap
early in the second half by scoring
on five straight possessions to
take a 59-57 lead with 15:39 to
go.

Then, with five minutes
remaining, the Panthers hit a cold
spell which produced only five
points and two free throws and

consequently cost them the game. I

“It was about 86-82, and they
[N.C. State] went on a big run and
we went cold. It was a two, three
minute span where they got a
couple of fast breaks and caught
us off guard,” Porter said.

Wolfpack Coach Jim Valvano
said, win or lose, it was a great
game and “exceptional
tournament basketball.”

Pitt Coach Paul Evans would
have agreed if his team had played
the second half the way they
were capable of.

“Considering the playoffs?
[Losing] was a real knockout
punch for us,” said Steelers free
safety Thomas Everett.

“We had a chance to be in the
driver’s seat,” said strong safety
Carnell Lake. “We can only hope
for the playoffs now  if we win
our last three games.”

Pittsburgh, looking for its third
straight win, battled the highly
talented Oilers evenly for most of
the game —— yardage-wise, time

_of possession-wise, statistically

through and through. Enough to
impress even Houston head coach
Jerry Glanville, not one of
Pittsburgh’s biggest fans.

“The Steelers played harder
than anybody has all season. They
played like it was a playoff game
for them. I give them a lot of
credit for the way they played.”
You see, Houston rapped
Pittsburgh 27-0 six weeks ago in
the Astrodome, and Glanville
mostlikelywasn’t expecting much

1 from the Steelers.

But Houston, a chromedome
team that is known to fall apart
when the weather outside gets
frightful — remember the 1978
AFC Championship game, in
which Pittsburgh romped the
Oilers 54-5 in a sea of icy slush?
—, played very well itself,
especially quarterback Warren
Moon.

“A lot of people say we don’t
play well in bad weather. Well,
this is our proudest moment. It
wasn’t too pleasant out there, but
the game was well—played. And
Moon, he did a heck of a job,”
said Glanville.

Moon, despite the conditions,
completed 12 of his 20 passes for
171 yards and two scores,
including a controversial 37-yard
shot to wide receiver Haywood
Jeffries on Houston’s last drive
that helped set up its final
touchdown. Debatable in the
sense that it appeared thatjeffries
had run out of bounds in making
the play. “I thought the ball was

thrown out of bounds,” said

Bench  

Continued from page 10

this year, Brookin now realizes
the limitations of the team.

“We only go six or seven deep
and it’s definitely going to be a
factor, but that really shouldn’t
matter. Anybody coach Evans puts
in there is expected to do their
best,” Brookin said.

Pitt’s inside game suffered in
both games of the tournament
this past weekend, and perhaps it
will until the guards ﬁnd a way to
get the ball to Shorter.

Porter's new role at the point

’may take him some time to get _

used to, but Pitt’s run and gun
offense is condusive to Porter's
abilites. However, Miller's role
will be sorely missed as the ﬂoor
general.

cornerback Rod Woodson, who
was in man-to-man coverage on
Jeffries. “I just stopped, and
Ueffriesl caught it.” ‘

The NFL’s rnillstone, a.k.a.
instant replay, somehow provided
no insight, and the play somehow
stood.

‘Of course, snow is nothing new
to Moon; he played six seasons
for Edmonton of the CFL, and
Edmonton ain’t exactly Miami
Beach.

Houston took a 14-10 lead into
the halftime locker room on
Moon's TD passes to Curtis

Duncan and Ernest Givins and
held a 16-13 advantage at the end
of the third quarter, but what
really saved the Oilers were the
two goal-line stands that kept
Pittsburgh out of their end zone.
On their first possession of the
game, the Steelers found
themselves in a first-and—goal
situation at the Houston 3. Three
plunges by Worley and Merril
Hoge were turned away, and the
Steelers were forced to settle for
a Gary Anderson field goal. .

Then in the second half, a 17-
play drive that consumedjover
half the fourth quarter stalled

inside the Houston 2-yard line,
and the Steelers were again forced
to kick for the three points.

“We tried to punch it in with
our best people, and it just didn’t
work for us,” said Steelers
quarterback Bubby Brister, who
was 10 of 22 for 78 yards in the
passing department. “We’ve had
trouble with it all year,” he said.

“Those defensive stands are
what saved the game for us,” said
Glanville. “No doubt about it.”

‘‘\We’d have them on the ropes,
and suddenly they'd make the

11

big play. It was frustrating,” said
Pittsburgh defensive end Tim
Johnson.

“I felt like we played our hearts
out,” a depressed Tim Worley
said after having his broken left

index finger tended to in the

training room. j“They just got the
breaks." No pun intended,
naturally.

On one positive note, Worley

, did have his best outing as a
professional, gaining 103 yards

on 18 carries. “That doesn’t matter
to me, ” he said. “All I was looking
for was a win. That's all.”

they lost to had 30 combined
wins. The Vikings went to the
Super Bowl that year. In 1988,

an average of 27.5 per game —

of 26.8 points per game — and 

missed the playoffs outright.

Something has to be done about
‘this. Install a random scheduling
‘system. Aside from divisional
matchups, allow the strong teams
to play the same schedules as the
weaker teams. None of this fifth-
place schedule stuff. Scratch the
plan B free agency. It promotes
the quick ﬁx, another parity
contributor. Let the owners build
their own teams through the draft
and unprotected free agents, then
let them shoot it out on the field.
May the best teams win.

After 13 weeks in the season,
19 teams have a solid shot at the
playoffs. Sure, i.t makes things
interesting, but where is the
substance? There are too few
exceptional teams and too few
real stinkers. Impossible as it may
seem, the NFL has become too
competitive. Upsets, if you can
still call them that,' are occurring
so frequently that it has become
numbing. Bad teams are getting
blown out. Good teams are getting
blown out. Trouble is, how can
anyone discern between the good
and the bad anymore?

Well, in this nutty season, thank
heaven for 11-2 San Francisco
and 1-12 Dallas.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, December 4, 1989

Morningstar hopes to fill holes in Panthers’ depth chart

By Mike Rampa and
Brad Fazzone
The Pitt News

It is a long way from the state
of Washington to Pennsylvania,
but Pitt’s top frontcourt reserve,
Darren Morningstar, is a Pacific
Northwest native who now calls
Pittsburgh his home.

Morningstar arrived at Pitt in
January of 1988 after leaving the
U.S. Naval Academy in January
of 1987.

I He averaged 12 points per
game and six rebounds at Navy

but claimed, “The military life
was not for me.”

According to Morningstar, the
Academy’s main ambition was
to make U.S. Naval officers out
of its underclassmen, with
basketball and academics further
down on its priority list. Since
he was not looking to the military
for a career, he decided to leave,
hoping to pursue basketball in a
different college atmosphere.

Morningstar’s desire for
tougher competition led him to
Pitt and the Big East conference,
where he anticipated being

Rutgers
Continued from page 9
offensive plays. Walker, however,
finished the drive with a two yard
touchdown run, giving Pitt a 39-

22 lead.

Late in the game, Pitt put it out
of reach 46-22 as freshman Jim
Bundy‘ got his first substantial
running experience of the season.
Bundy and Walker combined for
54 yards rushing and Bundy
scored his first touchdown of the
season from one yard out to cap
off the drive.

T om T arver replaced Erney at

I quarterback and threw the last

TD of the day, a 14 yard pass to
Jim Guarantano.

Despite the drop in attendance
from last year’s Emerald Isle
Classic (42,000), promoter Jim
O’Brien said the Classic will
continue. Both Gottfried and
Anderson expressed interest in
bringing their teams back.

NOTES:

- Curvin Richards had 98 yards
rushing, Adam Walker had 81

— Henry Tuten had 127 yards
receiving

- The Pitt defense held Rutgers
to 52 yds rushing on the day

— Erney was leading rusher for
Rutgers

— Pitt had 545 yards total offense
to Rutgers 382

coached by Pitt’s Paul Evans.

According t Morningstar,
attending Pitt a d playing under
Evans and his “fine coaching
staff” would allow him to better
his game and help Pitt’s chances
to compete for a Big East
championship and a national
title.

“I was thrilled to have the
chance to play with the type of
players Pitt has in their
program,” Morningstar said.

From February to August of
1988, the 6—foot-11-inch, 250-
pound sophomore spent his

time becoming familiar with the
city of Pittsburgh and Pitt’s
weight room.

“That time period was very
frustrating because I missed the
deadline for enrolling in the
winter term by one week, and I
took my frustrations out on the
basketball court and in the
weight room. I added 40 pounds
and a lot of muscle to my frame,”
Morningstar said.

“I also knew it would be vital
to develop new moves in the
post and increase the intensity
in my game a couple notches to

play with the kind of players

. [found in] the Big East.”

Morningstar has been absent
from collegiate basketball for
over a year due to his midyear

transfer, but he has been active -

in other competitions. He
participated in this year’s U.S.
Olympic Festival in Norman,
Okla., where he was coached
by Seton Hall’s P.J. Carlessimo.
Morningstar’s East team received
a silver medal, as he contributed
10 points and five rebounds in
the championship game.
