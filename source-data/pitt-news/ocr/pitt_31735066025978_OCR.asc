Pitt sophomore Jason Thomson
depends on PATransit to take him home
every Friday. V

He commended PA'I‘ransit for its usual
promptness while waiting for its arrival to
take him home Friday. He said he’s been
using it since he came to Pitt last year, and
that the bus has been more than ﬁve min-
utes late only in a few instances.

“Certainly there’s going to be down-
sides with the transit system, like with pub-
lic systems everywhere, but I think
PATransit does a good job, and the posi-
tives outweigh the negatives,” he said.

However, there are some people who
disagree.

Pitt student Hank Alward rides
PATransit buses every day to get to class,
although he has several complaints about
the service. His major grievance is that the
buses are “a little bit crowded in the mom-
ing, and they smell bad.”

On weekends, he said he’s had to wait
up to a half-hour to get a bus.

“It’s a little bit inconvenient,” Alwards
said

Pitt student Jenn Peters also gives the
system bad marks overall.

“’1he bus drivers are mean. They’re not
helpful. They should take the time to help
you, because if you’re sincerely asking for
help, they just brush you oﬂ°,” Peters said.

She said she believes some of them act
that way because they get hassled by riders
who don’t really need the help.

Peters noted that some rules for riding
the bus are unclear. For example, she said,
often it’s uncertain if riders are expected to
pay immediately or upon leaving the bus.

“The one time I went to pay, the bus
driver just kept saying, ‘You can’t do that)”

Like Alward, Peters also reported jam- 1

when local schools let out in the aftemoon.
She similarly said some buses are less
than sanitary.
, “'I‘l1ey’re smelly. They’re» not clean,

Peters did, however, give PATransit
high marks for its assistance of persons

‘They go out of their way to help dis-

She said PAT‘ransit does a good job of _

the bus. She also -said additional bus shel-l

U.N. to learn about agreement
made with Saddam Hussein

Around the World

BAGHDAD, IRAQ — Tomorrow the
U.N. Security Council will hear about
the deal that has been reached to open
Iraqi palaces to weapons inspectors.

That is when U.N. Secretary
General Koﬁ Annan will brief council
members. He is returning to New York
from Baghdad tomorrow. A spokesman
says he has already briefed U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and British Prime Minister Tony_ Blair
by phone.

. Annan reached the agreement with
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein yesterday.
Details of the plan aren’t being
released, but a U.N. spokesman says
time limits on inspections aren’t part of

' the deal. The United States and other

Security Council members had rejected
any deadline.

Across the Nation

NEW YORK 4 Former Connecticut
senator and governor Abraham Ribicoff
has died-

Ribicoff also served as a secretary

of health, education and welfare in the

Kennedy administration.

Family friend Barbara Walters said
Ribicoff died in a nursing home yester-
day. He was 87 and' suffered from
Alzheimer’s disease.

The Democrat’s career in public
service spanned more than four
decades. _

He began his career as a state legis-
lator in the Connecticut General
Assembly and went on to serve as a
congressman, governor, a cabinet mem-
ber, a member of the U.S. delegation to
the United Nations and a U.S. senator.

As a senator, Ribicoff gained
national prominence at the 1968
Democratic National Convention,
where he made a blistering speech crit-
icizing Chicago Mayor Richard Daley
for the strong-arm tactics used to con-
trol protesters.

WASHINGTON — The nation’s gov-
ernors are meeting in Washington,
ﬁghting to keep tax money closer to

CHICAGO — Doctors aren’t immune
to sexual harassment.

' A poll being published this week
indicates more than a third of female
doctors have been sexually harassed.

’ Overall, more than 47 percent
reported having been targets of gender-
based harassment, while nearly 37 per-
cent reported having been sexually
harassed.

Younger physicians reported higher

rates of sexual harassment than older.

most common site.

‘The poll was published in the

SALT LAKE CITY — William
Leavitt, the man arrested in the Anthrax
scare, was released from a Nevada jail
yesterday after tests determined that the
anthrax he and another man possessed
was a harmless animal vaccine.

Leavitt was freed on his own recog-
nizance, but the charges against him
haven’t been dropped.

It was later found that he is a dis-
tant relative of Utah Governor Mike
Leavitt.

The govemor’s father — Dixie
Leavitt — says the relation is 10 or 12
generations back. He says they are both
descended from an English-immigrant

THOMASVILLE, Pa. — The pilot of
a single—engine Cessna 172 died yester-
day when the plane crashed while
approaching a runway at the York
Airport.

Jackson Township Police say the
woman, who was ﬂying from Potomac,
Md., was dead by the time emergency
crews reached the wreck at the airport,
some 90 miles west of Philadelphia.

Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Jim Peters says the pilot,
whose name was not released pending
notiﬁcation of relatives, was the only
person aboard the plane. He says the
plane crashed just short of the runway
at 12:30 p.m.

Police say a crew from an Army
National Guard helicopter ﬂying near-
by witnessed the crash and was the ﬁrst
on the scene to assist.

Peters says the FAA and the
National -Transportation Safety Board
are investigating the cause of the acci-
dent. A

of. open communication between
parties.

Dr. Benjamin Eidelman, one of
the five faculty members who orig-
inally requested Thursday’s formal
meeting, expressed concern that
communication gaps have been
apparent since the proposal of the
restructuring plan, even at planned
meetings.

“We’re here today because lack
of communication is a problem. If
the [University Senate} chairmen
had brought up more information at
faculty meetings, this state of igno-
rance would not have occurred,”
said Eidelman. ,

Michaelopoulos suggested the

faculty’s shortage of information,

might result from many faculty
members’ inability to attend the
meetings.

Dr. Nicholas Bircher, another of
the five members who wrote the let-
terrequesting Thursday’s meeting,
said thefaculty should have been
made a part of drafting the unified
plan proposals from the beginning.

A recurrent theme expressed at
the meeting was that the faculty are
more concerned with opening com-
munication lines and keeping their
academic identity than with how
much they’re paid. '

Some medical school faculty
aren’t really concerned with who
pays the bills — whether it’s Pitt or
UPMC. But many fear that if some

of Pi'tt’is health schools come under ‘

the control of the UPMC, there

might be a displacement of power

within the faculty community.
“This corporate entity would

then have an enormous power, not
apparently balanced by the force of
academic procedural rule,” said
Paradise.

Dr. Arthur Feldman showed
support for UPMC Health Service
control when’ he said, “In point of
fact, we are part of the’ UPMC
already. We need to restructure, re-
engineer, and move forward.” ,

Thomas Detre, the senior vice
chancellor of the health sciences,
explained that there were two
choices: either to let a company
take overthe medical center; or to
discuss internal mergers like the
central practice plan — which com-
bines 18 UPMC-related corpora-
tions. . . ' ‘

Richard Baron, the head "of
UPMC’s radiology department,
tried to alleviate faculty fears when
he said, ‘‘I don’t‘ think there’s any-
thing inherent about the central
practice plan that’s go_ing to take
away your academic mission or
vision.”

Also during the meeting,
University Senate President Gordon
Macleod spoke of his concern about
the rumors circulating among med-
ical students. He said he was
informing Michaelopoulos of these
rumors in the hopes that the interim
dean could help allay them.

Michaelopoulos sent out a six-
page e-mail of facts in response to
medical students’ request to keep
themselves abreast of the‘ events
concerning their faculty.

Michaelopoulos said he will
hold a meeting geared specifically
for medical students in mid-March.

Academic quality not
applicant quantity

Chancellor Nordenberg armounced at the board of
trustees meeting last Thursday that Pitt is becoming
more selective with the students it accepts; the average
SAT score of students so far accepted for Fall 1998 is
almost 30 points higher than it was for students accept-

~ ed at this time last year.

Along with increases in alumni donations, and the
increase in size of the applicant pool of prospective
students, this will boost Pitt's ranking in the college-_
rating publications. V

But these facts are meaningless, as they are in no
way an indication of Pitt's academic quality.

An increase in the number of applicants isgreat,
but Penn State received 25,000 applications last year
compared to CalTech's 2,200 and Harvard's 9,000. But
would one consider’ Penn State to be a better school
than CalTech or Harvard? .

VV1th Pitt coming off a successful football season,
the temptation of any football-loving parent to send his
son or daughter here has increased. And if an applicant

. chooses according to the school's football program,‘

should he really be bothering with an application?

Instead of looking to increase its pool of appli-
cants, Pitt should-look to increase the quality of the
education it provides. Just raising admissions stan-
dards sounds a lot like those middle school principals
who, on the day of the Iowa tests, place the bad ldds in
detention, or conveniently "suspend" them from
school for the day.

Increasing the admissions standards does not help
anyone; all it does is doctor Pitt's image, without an

. real effort to improve academic quality. -

V Many students graduate not knowing how to con-
struct a coherent sentence or calculate the interest on

: their credit card bills. While Pitt's Basic Writing and
College Algebra courses do seek to eradicate ﬂiis '

problem, they appear to miss the mark with a number

it of students. The Writing Center provides advice to

those who need help with composition, but those who

‘ often need ﬂie help do not voluntarily seek it out.

Pitt might want to consider using its satellite cam-

I puses to help those students who have less college"

preparation: Farm them out to Greensburg or
Titnsville, where they may ﬁnd more help on the
smaller, more personal campuses.

The Oﬂice of Admissions should be more selec-

. tive and have tougher requirements for entry, but the

University should increase the quality of the curricu-
lum, as the expectations of those who qualify would be
higher. .

The rising tide of isolationism

Michael Berquist

Columnlst

Readers of my columns know that
I don't particularly care for the direc-
tion that politics is currently headed (I
probably wouldn't have anything to
write about otherwise.) Witch hunts

into the personal lives of our leaders,"

the inﬂuence of special-interest’ groups‘
making government less responsive to
the people and the poor quality of our

public servants are signiﬁcant prob- ‘

lems that I have written about exten-
sively.

However, there is an overall trend
in politics today that is even more trou-
bling and dangerous: It is the rising
feelings of isolationism here in the
United States.

That people are becoming
increasingly isolationist is unquestion-
able. ‘ By increasing margins,

A Americans everywhere are complain-

ing about free-trade and the globaliza-
tion of the American economy, about
foreign aid (though it is a minuscule
portion of our budget) and about other
factors they attribute to the world
becoming smaller. .

What is so worrying about the ris-
ing tide of isolationism is the fact that it
is so nonpartisan in nature. From Pat
Buchanan to Ross Perot to Dick
Gephardt, the isolationists span the
ideological spectrum.

Conservatives rant angrily about
how the United Nations costs America
its "sovereignty," an argument used by
isolationists to keep America out of the
League of Nations during the 1920s.
Labor leaders denounce trade pacts
that "expo " jobs.to low-wage, low-
sldll countries, though there is scant
evidence to support any of their accu-

_ sations. In California and Texas, politi-

cians on boﬂr sides of the aisle angrily

blame illegal immigrants ﬁ'om Mexico
for costing their constituents their jobs.
Immigrants, foreign workers and
diplomats all make wonderful punch-
ing bags for politicians, but they are lit-
tle more than convenient targets upon
which people tend to project their own
fears and inadequacies when they ﬁnd
themselves unable, or unwilling, ‘to
comprehend the world around them.
There is, disturbingly, a historical

precedent for these sorts of foolish

fears about globalization and job secu-
rity. At the turn of the 19th century, for
example, England was at the height of
its power and was invaded by books
that warned daddy about the coming
invasion of cheap German goods that
would put Britons out of business; One
book warned: "Make observations in
your surroundings  You willﬁnd that
the material of some of your own
clothes was probably woven in
Germany.  "

Replace the word "Germany"
with the word "Japan," or any other
low-wage competitor of the United
States, and you'll see "words and phras-
es that American politicians have
grown fond of using. ' -

The isolationism and xenophobia
of our present political climate are even
more frightening because of the possi-
bility that American policy-rnakers
could do real harm, not only to our

_ economy, but also to the. world econo-

my. .

In 1995, isolationist politicians
reacted angrily to President Clinton's
decision to extend loans to the govern-
ment of Mexico to help bail out that
government after the peso collapsed
The decision was a no-brainer, but iso-

‘ lationist politicians angrily denounced

the fact that our government was
"sending" American money to Mexico
(actually, we weren't —— these were

THE PITT NEWS

loans) when it should be used here on
American citizens. VVrthout the stead-
fast support of some of our wiser lead-
ers, the loan package might have been
scrubbed and the Mexican government
would almost surely have collapsed.

As one observer noted, "Anyone
who thinks it put too much taxpayer
money at risk should try to make a
realistic estimate of the cost of policing
a 2,000 mile border with a hostile and
angry neighbor."

The furor over the 1995 loan guar-
antees and trade pacts like NAFTA
underscore the dangers of isolationism.
While all evidence shows that trade has
producedanetgaininjobshereinthe
United States, organized labor has
mounted an effective scare campaign
that has convinced workers to fear their
jobs are in danger of being exported to
foreign countries. But the real danger is
that, one day, these individuals might
ﬁnd themselves in a position to do real
harm.

are all once and future presidential can-
didates who have brilliantly mastered
the skill of playing on the fears of blue-
collar workers about globalization and
the future. Behind them is an increas-
ingly large bloc of voters who sincere-
ly believe that immigrants are out to
get their jobs, and that foreign aid is the
only thing the government spends their
tax dollars on. ‘

Unforttmately, if these _ dema-
gogues continue to make their clout
felt or move higher in the halls of
power, I can assme you that the results
will almost surely be disastrous for
blue-collar workers, for the United
States and for the world. _

theater for loyal Cubs fans.

For those who didn’t, he was the
subject of impersonation by radio
morning men and stand-up comedians.

National League baseball in
Chicago meant Harry Caray. Harry
Caray meant mispronounced names,
incorrect scores, and a few slurred sen-
tences -— brought on by a lifetime love
affair with the King of Beers that only

THE PITT NEWS

ended after a stroke in the late 1980s.

Caray stood for inaccurate report-
ing. He was the poster boy for garbled
syntax. He would have thought anteri-
or cruciate was married to uncle-erior
cruciate.

That’s what made him fun. That’s
what makes sports fun — not the tech-
nicalities, but the emotion, the excite-
ment and'the energy that throws all the
technicalities out the window faster
than you can say, “Cubs win!”

Caray stood for that, too. He called
games on WGN-TV like a 5-year-old
explains’ episodes of the Mighty

Morphin Power Rangers — slowly at.

first, then, when things get exciting,
losing all control of verbal abilities and
resorting to shouts and grunts.

Strat-o-matic baseball fans — ones
who don’t know any stories about Babe
Ruth but who could tell you Sammy
Khalifa’s career on-base percentage to
the seventh digit (he’s an old Pirate
inﬁelder, for those of you scrambling
for "The Baseball Encyclopedia") —
thought Caray was an idiot. That he
made light of the serious aspects of
baseball. That he didn’t do his home-
work.

But sportscasters don’t pay rent by
doing homework. They make money
for entertaining the fans, and above all
else, Harry Caray was entertaining.

He would take his shirt off and sit

in the bleachers of Wrigley Field,
singing “Take Me Out to
Ballgame” at the top of his lungs and
swaying to the melody along with an
outﬁeld full of inebriated Cubs fans.
When the Cubs organized a giveaway
day where each fan got a pair of over-
sized black Harry Caray eyeglasses, he
put a pair on overhis already oversized
specs and called the game.

In the booth, the game never inter-
rupted a good story. Andre Dawson
could have hit a homer past the Illinois
state line,'but if Caray hadn’t ﬁnished
talking about last night’s dinner
engagement with Ron Sjanto, then

Dawson’s moment of glory would wait .

until after they tipped the waiter and
grabbed their coats. . ' -'
Stories weren’t Caray’s only spe-
cialityg; the announcer came up with
more broadcasting gems than John
Madden and Bob Costas could ever
collectively total. Once, during a White
Sox broadcast, Chicago’s Jorge.'~Orta

misplayed a fly ball.  ~.

“Aw, how could he lose the ball in
the sun?” ‘Caray asked his audience.
“He’s from Mexico!” ' ‘

Good point. White Sox fans, some-
where in the dark," kindergarten-edu-
cated recesses of their minds, were
probably thinking the exact same
thing.

Names were also subject to mas-

Cubs second baseman ever, became
“Ryan Sanderson” on occasion. Latin
players were subject to having
Gonsalez replaced by Sanchez,

and so on. A .

Mistakes? Sure. Misprouncing a
name over the air is the cardinal sin of
all broadcasters.

But, cardinal sins don’t apply to .

sportscasters, especially those older
than the pope to begin- with. Ca.ray’s
mistakes were devastatingly funny, and
unlike the kid in the talent show who
gets booed off the stage for butchering
“Moonlight Serenade” on the violin,
Caray’s blunders endeared" him to a
city and to a nation of baseball fans.
After his death, fans made the pil-
grimage to Wrigley Field to pay their
respects. Flowers adorned the side-
walk. A pile of remembrances — rang-

ing from cards to oversized eyeglasses ‘

_—— littered the pavement in front of the
ballpark. I

Among the standard mourning
materials were cans of Budweiser. And
in what may have been the best possi-
ble ﬁnal tribute to Caray, the cans were

empty.
He taught his fans well.

Columnist loses
sight of reality in
U.S.-Iraq conflict

James Maude's Feb. 18 com-
ments on Iraq vs. the U.S. should
more accurately be titled "Peace
Preferable to War," except for his
own use of propaganda in demoniz-
ing the U.S. and pitying Iraq. It's too
bad that such a high percentage of
people don't trouble themselves to
research this particular subject as it
is debated in a number of worthy
news magazines.

Let's review the facts one more
time:

1) Iraq has already been at war with
Iran. . h

2) Iraq attacked Kuwait without
provocation. The attack really was
about oil (Goshl).

3) Iraq lobbed Scud missiles into
Israel in a feeble attempt to incite
Arab brethren to attack Israel.

4) The world community con-
demned Iraq and’ pushed Hussein
back out of Kuwait. One of the con-
ditions of Iraq's surrender was
inspection of the destruction of its

 
     
 

weapons of war by an international
group.

5) Iraq has one of the biggest stock-
piles of chemical and biological
weapons in the world. And it has
been ‘gleefully’ building themgaswfast

as it can since (and probably‘be'fore)._, 

the Iran-Iraq war. + _

Granted, the U.S. has been'bum-
bling about in thp,Middle East for
some time and is -not as pure as the

but our mistakes and designs in the
Middle East are minor in compari-

chotic behavior of the dictator of
Iraq.

Up to Pitt's workers
to fight back

Q In Paul Clark's column on
Monday, Feb. 16, the true Republican
agenda is revealed: keep down the
wages of working people and prevent
them from achieving any modest
gains in their standards of_ living; at
the same time, reward those who can
extract the most from these workers
by cutting wages and benefits, laying
off workers, and replacing them with
temporary workers who have no job
security, beneﬁts or opportunities for
education. "

do have education benefits, which
allows them to attend Pitt and to send
their children to Pitt so that they can
have better life chances.

However, the administration is
hell-bent on busting the union. If they
succeed, it willbe all the more difﬁ-
cult for working people to obtain the
higher education that Mr. Clark
believes is the ticket to a better life.

Mr. Clark did actually have a
valid. point in saying that "the Pitt

maintenance workers can take care of '

themselves." Ultimately, it will be up
to the workers to fight back. If_ they
go on strike, they will have to prevent
the University from hiring replace-
ment workers.

The real question is, which side
are you on? Mr. Clark, for one, is
probably the first on-the’list to scab

on the strike. For those of you who ’

are with the maintenance workers,

you‘ need to get involved now. Get in ‘

touch with members of the ISO, or
Students in Solidarity.

It's -true that the University can't
run asa socialist institution, since we

live in a capitalist society. But, f1ght- B I

thing that will go on as long as capi-
talism exists.

For the United States, two moments
stand out from the Nagano Winter
Olympics: The sparkling smile of 15-year-
old Tara Lipinski. And the collapse of the
favored men’s hockey team

First, the good Lipinski more than
made up for several U.S. disappointments in
he Games with her stunning upset of team-

nate Michelle Kwan in women’s ﬁgure
skating. She became the youngest Winter
Olympic gold medalist ever.
’ Millions of Friday night’s television
‘viewers already knew the outcome of the
Kwan—Lipinski battle because of the time
liiference and CBS’ decision to show the

Zaped competition in prime time. But, peo-
Jle of both sexes and all ages still watched
together and in amazement

Even at one of Oakland’s ﬁnest water-

.ng holes, Lipinski’s routine interrupted
many activities including a couple’s mutual
throat-cavity search, a guy’s shot in eight-
ball, my ﬁiend’s lighting another cigarette, a
grindfest consisting of a group of _hoochy

“-rers of each sex, and me from gulping

The golden lights a top the Cathedral shined

No, not in football. Not in basketball.

The win came in men’s swimming, as Pitt col-

Thirteen became a lucky number for the Pitt
men’s swimming and diving team when they cap-
tured their 13th Big East trophy and proceeded to take
the trophy for a victory lap around Trees Pool on
Saturday night

On top of hosting the event, Pitt also became the
ﬁrst team to win back-to-back Big East swimming
‘  titles since Pitt accomplished the “two for two” feat

Woodsruns show in Lady Panthers’ Senior Night victory

Kevin Lilley

Sports Edltor

It was Farrah’s night.

Saturday was Senior Night for Pitt
Lady Panther basketball. Farrah Woods is
the tearn’s only senior. It was her night.

And she took it.

Woods scored 17 points in her last reg-
ular—season game ever for the Lady
Panthers. She added seven rebounds and
three assists to lead Pitt (6-20) past the
Providence Friars, 70-54.

“It was an incredible feeling,” she said,
as she walked toward the postgame auto-
graph signing. “I just had all this emotion
inside. I knew we were going to do good
this game. 

“Can we stop and go the other way? I
don’t want to go out there yet.”

After bullying her way past the Friars
all night, after showing no fear in a tightly
called contest — scoring all of her points
from close range and punishing enough
Friars to get her ﬁfth foul with 36 seconds
left in the game — Woods shied away from
the 8- and 9-year-old girls waiting eagerly
for their new hero to emerge and sign a
poster or two.

The girls —— representing area Girl
Scout troops and basketball squads — got
a good dose of Woods early in the evening,
as the senior scored Pitt’s ﬁrst two points
on two free throws. On the Panthers’ next
possession, Woods took a high pass from

jumper by Providence guard Kerri

three-point expert Alecia Balich drained

THE PITT Nigws

Pitt women swimmer finish
third at Championships

Matt Townsend & Jay Yander
The Pitt News

As tl1e Panther men’s swimming team
celebrated a gold, the Pitt women’s team
could only watch .

Notre Dame would take the trophy
stand for the women at the 1998 Big East
Championship meet, withthe Panthers ﬁn-
ishing a distant third — over 200 points
behind the Fightin’ Irish.

After the ﬁrst day of competition on
Wednesday, the scores read dilferently — on
the strength of Jamie Tornazich’s third-place
performance in the 1—meter diving ﬁnals and
a string of top—three relay ﬁnishes, the
Panthers took an early lead in the overall
competition over the singing Irish.

“I was really happy with the way that
the relay teams pulled their times,” said Pitt
Head Coach Marian Cassidy Keen.

On Thursday Notre Dame out-placed
Pitt in all four of the women events. The Irish
opened the day with a win in the 500
freestyle and ended it with a four—second win
in the 400 medley relay. A point swing of
nearly 100 points pushed Notre Dame to ﬁrst
place and an 81-point lead over second place
Pittsburgh. A

Samantha Chabotar swam a 4:28.30 in
the 400 individual medley, but was only
good enough for third behind a Vrllanova
and Notre Dame swirmner in Friday’s open-

ing event

Liz Perry picked up another top—three
ﬁnish in the 100 butterﬂy at a 56.29.

“Liz Perry did a greatjobin three ofthe
relays for us and especially in the 100 ﬂy,”
said Keen. '

A couple of events later sophomore
Jamie Tomazich took home another third
place in the threeémeter diving event with a
score of 496.95. The Pitt 800 ﬁeestyle relay
team also took a bronze ﬁnish, earning a
time of 7:33.48 in the event — good enough
for a spot in the Senior Nationals this April.

Also on Friday, Nicole Palombo placed
third in the 100-yard breaststroke, earning a
Senior National berth and qualifying for
NCAA Championship consideration. .

Heading into Saturday, the Irish lead

had ballooned to more than 150 points, with ~

Pitt’s lead over third-place Villanova was
only 14 points. .

Vrllanova beat Pitt in the ﬁrst three
events of the day and moved into second
place for good However, the Panthers con-
tinued their relay success with a third-place

The Panthers ended the day more than 200
points behind Notre Dame and just 22 points
back of Vrllanova.

“The main thing is that the girls should-
n’t hang their heads after the way that they
swim,” said Keen. ‘

awfully hard to get where we are at this
moment.”

Pitt clinched the championship, with
only two events remaining, after placing 1'-
2 in the 200—yard breaststroke with swim-
mers Devin Meece and Mike Pnon.

‘Theteam clinched the title early last
year,” Knoles said “But then again, we
won by more points also.”

In one of the closest Big East
Championships in three years, Pitt topped
runner-up Syracuse by only 99.5 points ——
close in swimming standards that normal-
ly allow for 100-point margins.

Senior captain Jon Haggerty came

away’ with three gold medals over the
weekend winning the 100-yard butterﬂy
for the third straight year, the 200-yard but-
terﬂy (setling a Trees Pool record) for the
second time in his career, and as a member
of the 200-yard freestyle relay team

“I wasn’t swimming as well as I want-
edto inthefall [1997],” Haggerty said “So
this year's medals mean a lot more to me.”

FROM PAGE 7

Fellow senior captain Eric Stefanski I

ended his career with his ﬁrst individual
Big East gold medal ever, winning the
100-yard freestyle, as well as being a
member of the gold—medal winning 200-
yard freestyle relay team. .

“I’ve collected too many second place
ribbons at this meet,” Stefanski said “It’s
nice to ﬁnally have a gold medal now.” ,

Meece, already qualiﬁed for the U.S.
Olympic time trials for the 2000 games,
shocked no one this weekend when he

swam away with two individual gold
medals, winning the 100-yard and 200-
yard breaststroke —- breaking both the
meet and the. pool records in the process.

“I did exactly what I set out to do,” I

Meece said “The meet is a lot longer than
I expected it to be. The key was to keep my
energy up.”

The 100-yard breaststroke proved to

be a “Panther Party,” as one team member _

described it, when Pitt placed four swim-
mers in the top six. Brian Elko won the sil-
ver, Steve Siler took fourth, Pnon placed
ﬁfth, and Adam Kotkiewicz captured sixth.

Siler also grabbed a gold medal in the
200-yard backstroke; he ranks 39th in the
world in the event. .

“I was out for a good time this week-
end,” Siler said “What’s a sport without
having some fun?”

Vlfrth the recent addition of several
new teams to the Big East, repeating as
champions, let alone winning, was not an
easy task to achieve, according to the
men’s coach.

“Miami has added a unique blend to
the Big East,” Knoles said “Every year
will be tougher and tougher to win.”

After falling behind early in the meet,
Pitt clawed their way to the Big East swim-
ming mountain once again using plenty of

determination and focusing on the job at.

hand p

“The team never lost focus at all,”
Knoles said “Our goal from the start was
to win the Big East title and to attain life-
time best scores.”

lowing a 16 to 6 Friar run, the visi-
tors had their biggest lead of the
game at 42-30. The Panthers cut the
Friar lead to 42-34 just before half-
time after Cummings slashed in the
lane for a layup and Greer put back
a Cummings’ miss.

‘‘In the ﬁrst half, Providence
had more energy, and they were
more scrappy than we were,”
Vlfillard said. “I thought we did a real
good job in the second half. We
made them work for their baskets,
and we eliminated their transition
baskets.” .

Pitt opened the second half
playing aggressive defense against
the Friars. Isaac Hawkins’ rebound

and put—back oﬂ" a missed free throw
tied the game at 53-53 with 11 min-
utes left to play. Greer’s two free
throws at 5:41 gave the Panthers
their first lead of the game at 62-60.
Pitt had a four—point lead with
37 seconds left, but a Jamel Thomas
jumper in the lane cut the Panther
lead to 73-71 with 22 ticks remain-
mg.
After Cummings made the ﬁrst
of two free throws, the Friars called
a timeout and diagiammed a high
pick and roll off of the inbounds

before Jarrett Lockhait fouled him
with one second left, forcing him to

talent.

In a postgame interview after
the eliminating loss to the Czech
Republic, U.S. winger Keith
Tkachuk said, “This was a waste
of time. I’ll be glad to just get out
of here.” .

No, Keith. It’s more like
putting off my calc homework to
watch you play was a waste of
time. V

Were the pros really that con-
cerned with winning in Nagano?

From the results, speculation
should arise that they weren’t.
The United States, Canada and
Sweden were the medal favorites,
and had the most NHL players on

their rosters. None won a medal.

In the U.S. loss to the Czechs,
goaltending looked to be the dif-
ference. After an early goal, the
Czechs’ Dominik Hasek used
every part of his ﬂailing body,
including his,forehead, to tum
back shots from all directions. On
the other ‘side of the ice, Mike
Richter seemed to catch all the
bad breaks, as pucks went in off
his skate, his defenseman’s hip
and the post- .

But besides Richter’s bad
luck, the Americans. also looked
slow and tired The NHL season
is longer and provides more bru-
tality to its players than does any-
European league. So an NHL
player goes to the Olympics after

Monday, 23 Febrary1998

 

50 or so games of getting beaten
up and lacks his usual intensity.
Lack of intensity was evident
—— there wasn’t much hitting in
these games. Yes, the larger
Olympic rink opens the game up,
but there were still opportunities
to lay someone out. The United
States, Canada and Sweden were

the biggest teams in the touma-4

ment but not one used this to its
advantage. The Russian and
Czech teams, prevailed —— they
were smaller, faster, quicker and
more exiting to watch.

Maybe they took lessons
from Lipinski.
