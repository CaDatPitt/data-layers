Pitt students prepare for-their ‘upward climb towards their final exams — so break out the strong coffee.

Staff Writer

Students who've eaten in the

’‘ Lothrop Cafeteria this academic
. year have noticed a change in

cafeteria policies. Aside from the
new bag-checking policy, the
Lothrop Cafeteria has also closed

‘off the back section of the dining
area to all Pitt students except
those on the football and basket-
ball teams.

Residents of Lothrop Hall are
uncertain as to why this new poli-

’ Icy began and who exactly start-

.ed it.

 Donavan Hughes, the director
f Housing and Food Services,

‘ §:;was unavailable for comment.

The new policy is causing

problems in the cafeteria because‘

many students say they find it
difficult to find a place to sit and
eat.

”My meal plan says I can eat
in any cafeteria on this campus,
and I think I should be able to eat_
anywhere in the Lothrop cafeter-
ia,” said Pitt freshman Missy
Magiske.

”I was really mad. The cafeter-
ia was packed, and the back
room was empty,” said Melony
Holly, another resident of
Lothrop Hall. "The football play-
ers don't even eat there until
7 p.m., so we should be able to
eat there until then.”

Mara Schubert, a Pitt sopho-

imore said, ”In our Lothrop

The Second Annual Pittsburgh
Poetry Festival to celebrate Inter-
national Human Rights Day 1987

[was held last night in the William

Pitt Union Ballroom.

The Universal Declaration of
Human Rights was adopted by
the United Nations‘ General As-
sembly on ‘Dec. 10, I948. The
Declaration sets forth all rights
and freedoms of every person. Its
preamble states that the declara-
tion is meant to serve ”as com-

‘ mon standardof achievement for

éézll peoples and all nations.”
3 To commemorate thisday, the

llforlhuman rights  

the Pittsburgh Poetry Festival for
the past two years. .

Last night's event included re-
marks on human rights given by
faculty members of the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh as well as federa-
tions that have sponsered this

event, a poetry contest for high»

school and university students
and a reading given by re-
knowned poet Lamont Steptoe.

The evening was dedicated to
a mutual friend of Dr. Dennis
Brutus of the department of black
studies ano"Steptoe, James. Bald-
win, who died not too long ago.

In opening remarks, Dr. Brutus
spoke of the importance of hu-
man values.

cafeteria, the back room has ‘not
been used any time I've been in
there. We should be able to eat
there. We have no_place to sit
half the time. The food is bad
enough, we don't need this.”

_”When there's no place to sit,
why should we be forced to wait
when there are available tables in
the back room where the
privileged few can eat in style,”
said Pitt freshman Kim Eppinger.
’’I think it's ridiculous. We pay all
this money, and most of the time,
you can't find a seat in this place.
It's usually packed in here, espe-
cially around noon.”

Samantha Steinmiller, a resi—'

dent of Lothrop, said, ’’I think it's
good for the team to have unity,

but they should let other students

Students upset with cafeteria policy

eat there first. They [the players]
don't get there until later, and the
rest of us need that back room.”

Jennifer Chuong, another resi-
dent of Lothrop, agreed: ”I think
it's good the team sticks together,
but they should leave it open
since they eat way after the other

‘students. It's not like we're going

to dirty their tables.” A

Dave Dixon, offensive guard
for the Panther football team,
said,.”|t [the cafeteria] is con-
venient that there’s no waiting
around after practice.”

’’It doesn't make a difference

that it's closed off. We're usually-

in practice in dinnertime hours,
so its good to have that there for
us,” said Eric Seaman, tight end
for the Panthers. V

charges

against    ‘ 

teacher

By William 'Young R

Assistant News Editor

Suresh Deman has filed corri-
plaints in the Magistrate Court
against the. head of the econom-
ics department, Dr. Kevin Sont-
heimer, claiming that Dr.
Sontheimer has racially harassed
him and is trying to force him
from theeconomics department.

”My academic credentials are '
very strong‘  so I don't see any
academic reason for doing that,”
Deman said. ”But I see, other ‘
than academic reasons, number

one, this guy doesn't like foreign. 
students, and a lot of foreign stu- -' ,

dents have suffered at his hand."

Deman claims that he has been
harassed both in person andiover
the phone, citing that his
teacher's assistant carrel in the
economics department was fre-
quently abused and that he
received harassing :phone calls

_ traced to theeconomics depart-

ment by the telephone company.

”I started receiving anonymous
phone calls, so we had a trace put
on the phone, and we got 25 calls I
traced from
department,” Deman said.’

Deman also claims that Sont-
heimer would frequently call him\
to his office and either dismiss
him without having said anything
or else charging him with various
things without substantiating
them. .

”He would shut the door, and
he would call his secretary, and_
he would accuse me with the
charges of theft or stealing or
breach of confidential documents
and all that stuf,” Deman said.
”I requested him to give me it in

writing, and he never gave it to _ ‘

me in writing. This has been_go~
ing on for the last two years. I
”One time, I knew he was go-

ingto do this, so I taped him, and , _ .

I have a 45-minute tape of him

accusing me of these things,but\-~~ .

he never filed anything,” he
added. .
Deman also claims that Sont-_’
heimer has verbally abused him
in public areas of the economics
department, a claim thatjennifer
Mayo, a secretary in the econom-
ics department, concurs with.
”One instance happened on

July 31 around [3 p._m.] or so,”‘ 7‘
Mayo said. .”I was going  and

I heard Dr. Sontheimer screaming

at Mr.‘ Deman‘ ’that'there would " _
 be charges of ‘theft and stealing _

Peru's entire soccer team killed in plane crash

LIMA, Peru — A navy plane
carrying Peru's first—place soccer

team crashed into the Pacific

Ocean, and all but one of the 43

8 ‘people on board were believed

killed, a navy spokesman said
Wednesday.

The navy official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said a

crew member was rescued from '
.the wreckage in the ocean six

miles north of the Lima airport.
He said five bodies were reco-
vered from the Tuesday night ac-
cident.

The spokesman said the twin-
engine Fokker’s landing gear
wouldn't lower when the aircraft
was trying to land. He said he
had no other details on the crash.

The plane's tail section was
found floating and the nose and
middle section were submerged
when rescue helicopters found
the wreckage today, the spokes-
man said.

He said the plane carried 43
people, including the six-member
crew, 28 members of the Allan-

‘ za Lima soccer team, eight cheer-

leaders and the team's coach,
Marcos Calderon.

The plane was declared miss-
ing Tuesday night while en route
to the capital from Pucallpa, 265
miles northeast ofLima in Peru's
Amazon jungle region, a navy
communique said.

NEWS BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED PRESS

Channel 5 television reported
that the plane was unable to land
at the Lima airport because of
technical problems and made
three overflights before the con-
trol tower lost contact with it at
10:30 p.m.

American ships escort

another Gulf convoy

WASHINGTON —- American
naval forces in the Persian Gulf
launched their 20th convoy oper-
ation early Wednesday,
shepherding three commercial
tankers through the Strait of Hor-
muz and into the gulf, the Penta-
gon said.

The convoy consisted of the
reflagged -Kuwaiti tankers Gas
Princess and Gas King and the

MV Patriot, an American ship un-
der charter to the U.S. Military
Sealift Command, according to
the announcement. The Patriot_is
used to ferry fuel to Navy ships
in the region.

The three tankers were safely
escorted through the Strait of
Hormuz by two guided-missile
frigates, the Elrod and the Ford,
and by mid-morning were steam-
ing northward ”uneventful|y,”
the Pentagon said.

cyanrde In Excedrin

SEATTLE — A woman was in-
dicted Wednesday in the cyanide
poisoning slayings of her hus-
band and another woman who
died in June 1986 after taking
capsules of Extra-Strength Exce-
drin laced .with the deadly sub-
stance.

FBI spokesman Joe Smith said
Stella Nickell, 43, of Auburn,
Wash., was charged with two
counts of causing death by means
of tampering with a consumer
product.

Conviction on such a charge
could bring _a maximum penalty

THE Pl'lT NEWS, Thursday, December 10, l987

of life in prison, Smith said.

The indictments were returned
by a federal grand jury sitting in
Seattle, and she was arrested,
Smith said.

Bruce Nickell, of Auburn, was
52 when he died June 5, 1986,
of what were initially believed to
be natural causes.

Five days later, Susan Katherine
Snow of Auburn collapsed at her
home and died the same day.

An autopsy found no cause of
death, but toxicology test results

‘determined she died of cyanide

poisoning. Poisoned Extra-
Strength Excedrin capsuleswere
found in her home.

Two days after that, authorities
determined cyanide was in a cap-
sule taken from a bottle used by
Nickell before he died, and test
results on June 19 degermined

Nickell died of. acute cyanide‘

poisoning.

LaRouche supporters during the
1984 presidential campaign, a
federal prosecutor told a jury
Wednesday.

Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Markham used his closing argu-
ment at the trial of Roy Frank-
hauser to portray Frankhauser as
the architect of a plot to protect
LaRouche and his inner circle
from a Boston grand jury investi-
gation of alleged credit card and
loan fraud.

But defense attorney Owen
Walker, in his closing, character-
ized Frankhauser as a minor
figure in the ”crazy” LaRouche.
organization whose advice to set-
tle with fraud victims was
ignored. '

Frankhauser, 48, of Reading,
Pa., faces up to five years in pri-
son and a $250,000 fine if con-
victed.

LaRouche, five of his political
organizations and five aides are
scheduled to be tried on similar
charges beginning Monday. Six
other LaRouche aides also are
charged in the 125-count indict-
ment, but three have been grant-
ed '
fugitives.

authentic decorations such as
crocheted tree ornaments, center-
piece displays and even baked
bread rolls.

Located on the first and third
floors of the Cathedral, the Na-

tionality Rooms ”show ‘people -

decorations that they're not used
to. Instead of seeing Santa Claus
and lights on the tree, what they
find here is diversity and authen-
ticity. People realize that Christ-
mas takes many forms,” said
Maxine Bruhns, the director of
the Nationality Rooms. _
Holiday decoration of the
rooms ”dates back to about the
1940s,” Bruhns said. Committees

. make the ornaments and deco-

rate the rooms. Quo Vadis, a
volunteer student organization of
about 25 students who conduct
the tours of the rooms, aid in the
creation‘ of some of the or-
naments. ‘

Tours of the rooms are availa-

ible by reservation Monday

through Friday from 9 to 4 p.m.,
Saturday from 9:30 to 3:30 p.m.
and Sunday from 11 to 3:30 p.m.
_ Many of the ornaments in the
rooms appear to be the same as
Americans are accustomed to,
such as trees, wreaths and
mangers. The difference is that
authenticity lies in the symbo|iza-
tion and legends behind the
decorations. ’

So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen!

It's here already. Yesterday, or so it seems, we wereall scur-
rying around madly trying to study for midterms, and now it's
time for finals. Hopefully, most of you have been studying for
the past couple of weeks because for some reason, no one saw
fit to provide a substantial reading period this year.

. The Pitt News wishes all its readers the best of l_uck for their
finals and wishes them a happy holiday season. _

On then, to other unfinished business for the term.

This is the final edition of the paper for the term. Publication
will resume Jan. 6 of next year. Until then," we're going to be

' spending our time studying and hoping for good grades.

Applications are now being accepted for the position of edi-
tor in chief for next year. The submission deadline is January

. 15. An announcement will be made sometime in the early part

of the winter term concerning the staff for next year.

As always, The Pitt News will be taking on new staff mem-
bers for the winter term, and anyone interested in working here
at the paper should stop in to the office at 441 William Pitt
Union to- pick up an application. T

We'd also like to take this opportunity to thank the many stu-
dents who took the time to write to us this term. The input was
certainly appreciated, and some of the comments have proved
invaluable. As is the case with any publication, some errors
in judgment were made over the course of the term, and some
important events were inadvertently ommitted.

In the future, we hope that by listening to the students, the
faculty and the staff, we can improve the quality of our paper
and increase its usefulness to our readers. ,

Again, thanks for reading us, and we'll see you after the new

In a nutshell   

Oh, for whatever I was able to bring
about the rebirth of patriotism. The last time
you and I talked, young people in this coun-
try thought to wear a uniform was a dis-
grace, and they were demonstrating about
all sorts of things. Today, we have people
waiting in line to enlist. T

of U.S. News and World Report about the
things of which he was most proud.

CONDRON

Celebrity campaigns too much

Bananas to Dole, to blazes with
Bush and to hell with Pat Robert-
son! I say Sonny Bono’s the guy

to look out for during the upcom- .

ing presidential elections.

Frightening but true, America's
favorite loser and former Cher-
holder in one of the most popu-
lar musical duos of all time,
reformed—restauranteur Sonny
Bono may just well be referring
to the democratic nomination
when he next croons ’’I Got You
Babe".

Well, that's not totally correct.

I don't know what party he's af-
filiated with, but word is, Sonny's
running for mayor of Palm
Springs, Calif.

It was frightening enough when

Dirty Harry decided to turn in his '

fake badge for a real one and be-
come good-guy mayor of Carmel
by the Sea, Calif. '

And we all know about
Gopher. Only in America could
someone who plays a character
named ”Gopher” on a TV show
whose best attribute is that it kept
little old ladies out of bingo halls
for. an hour, becomeja govern-
ment official.

is this all part of some deranged
plot for celebrities to take over
the country and eventually the
world? ‘i

V . Think about it for a while. The

highest ranking government offi-

‘ cial in our country used to make

monkey movies. This is the man
who is probably talking with Mik-
hail Gorbachev right now about
the future of the world.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised
if the old Gipper were trying to
turn Gorby into. an overnight
celebrity sensation here in the
United States and eventually talk
him into playing a lead role in a
movie, which Reagan will write,
direct and star in himself. (The
plot to make a movie after his
term of office has expired is just
another one of my suspicions —
but that's another story.)

According to a New York
newspaper on Nov. 30, ”Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev makes
his U.S. prime-time ,TV debut
tonight in an interview with NBC
News anchorman Tom Brokaw,
who described -him as ‘very ami-
able and very charming.’.”.

Could that debut actually have

/

SANSIG

been his screen test and part of
Reagan's twisted plan to cast him
in his movie?

It's all just a little too suspicious
to me. And now Sonny Bono?

Could you imagine, say eight
years down the road, Mr. Bono
being inaugurated as the presi-

dent of the U.S.? Who will be in— ‘

vited to the inauguration dinner?
Cher could show up in one of
those sheer numbers like the one
she dons in her latest video, ’’I
Found Someone”.

And if Cher’s going to be there,
there's going to be no drawing
the line when it comes to guests.
Why not invite Wendy O. Wil-
liams, Whitesnake, The Beastie
Boys, Ozzy Osborne, Ann and
Nancy Wilson, and anyone who

even got into Studio 54 back in’

the days when the Bee Gees were
making money? 4

At present, relatively few movie
stars hold government offices. But
if measures aren't taken soon, be-
fore you know it, our entire
minority whip could be full of
people who once did deodorant
commercials.

Some of my best bets for future
office holders include Jerry Gar-
cia, Buster Poindexter, John
Travolta; Sean Penn, Dan Rather
and Princess Stephanie.

It looks like right now, their
biggest competition .is coming
from television evangelists.
Maybe Pat Robertson is the only.
declared candidate right now, but
l’vvou|dn’t be surprised if Jerry
Falwell, Oral Roberts and yes,
even»-Ernest Angeleywere plan-

ning strategies for the 1992 elec-. r_

  

tions. I don't even want to think
what would happen to this coun-
try if any of them were elected.

What might even be the scari-
est thought of all from this whole,
convoluted idea,‘ is the possibili-
ty that the U.S. might be better
off, if in fact, it were run by
celebrities — which is obviously

‘ not saying much for our current

government.
There would most likely be a

lot of festivities, and we wouldn't -

have to worry about things ‘like
world hunger, the national debt,
and nuclear arms. We could all
just comfortably tune into our tel-
evision sets every night for the
show called World Politics.
And if we could get Gorby —
one of the most powerful men in
the world — in on the whole
deal, we wouldn't have to worry
about a Russian takeover while
we were stoned out of our minds.

I've heard somewhere that Rea? ,

gan has been using a lot of old
movie lines in his speeches —
movies he wasn't even in. And
his speeches are trite enough as
it is without old movie cliches.

It makes one wonder, if, by
chance, Mr. Bono were to be-
come president, would he pep-
per his speeches with lyrics from,
say, ah, old Sonny and Cher
songs? '

”We have nothing to fear but
gypsies, tramps and thieves.”

Too bad Cher isn't running for
office; she'd probably make a
damn good government official,
if she'd just learn to wear some
clothes. But then, I'm sure most
of you have heard of the porn star

who was elected to Italian parlia- ..

How ‘far

Earlier this year, a repeat child
molester was brought before
judge Dorothy Baker, an Oregon
state court justice. Richard Bate-
man, the defendent, has a histo-
ry of sexually assaulting children.

In one case, he was convicted

V and served a prison sentence for

his crime. In another instance, he
was accused of the same offense

' and tried, but because of insuffi-

cient evidence, the case was

dropped.

When he appeared before
Judge Baker for his most recent
offense, the assault of two more
children, he pleaded no contest,
enabling the judge to sentence
him to several more years in jail.
Along with the prison sentence,
she gave Bateman five years pro-
bation.

Thus far, the scenario sounds
familiar. Repeat offenders ac-

could probably hold a popular

you could even be her personal

that of Judge Dorothy Baker and

can our judges go to establish the law?

There are now judges ruling who
are a bit more humane and who,
hopefully, recognize the barbar-
ity of such an outrageous sense
of law and order.

Understand, I too am outraged

and disgusted by the Richard

Batemans of our society and by
the inabilty of our laws to proper-
ly and effectively penalize and/or
rehabilitate them. But for the
United States of America to allow

' a case like this to set a precedent

for the future would be insane.

Supporters of radical judicial
decisions like Judge Bakers’
search for immediate solutions to
problems. If we can't keep our
criminals in jail, or fail to convict
the guilty in the first place, then
the innocent must be warned of
the dangers. '

.But consider the aftermath of a
policy which labels and isolates
the wrongdoers and no-goods of
a society.

Violence and retribution would
almost certainly emerge if an in-
dividual were able to walk down
the street and recognize the man
who molested his teenage
daughter.

The Dead

Joyce's classic is graceully adap

By Michele Kiraly

Assistant Entertainment Editor

Don't let the title of John
Huston’s last film, The Dead, fool
you.

No, it's not about the Grateful
Dead, although a concert—movie
of this band does exist. And it's
not another horror film by
George Romero.

The Dead is the screen adap-
tion of Irish novelistjames Joyce's
first published work. The short
story of the same name was print-
ed in 1912 in the collection, The
Dubliners. The screenplay was
written by Huston’s son Tony,
whose version remains very close
to the original.

The director's daughter Ange|—-

ica stars as the solemn wife of
Gabriel Conroy, played by Donal
McCann, a popular performer of
Irish theater. - '
Set in 1904 Dublin, the film fo-

cuses on a family's after-

Christmas party, where relatives
and friends have gathered for
dancing, dining, conversation
and recitation. '

They talk of certain monks in
the countryside who sleep in
coffins to remind them of their
own mortality, which strikes a
few guests as morbid. The dinner
table conversation also revolves
around the latest play at the theat-
er, and the men speak of grow-
ing political tensions between
Ireland and England.

standing this film.

The script isn't one of Holly-
wood's pasted-together, punch
line—filled dramas. So, naturally,
the film is not entertaining in the

I sense that it makes people laugh.

. All this merriment and dialogue '

is conveyed at a painstakingly
slow pace. Although the film's

running time is about 90 minutes, '

many of those at the free screen- '

ing last week on campus could
not endure the movie and left. A
common remark was, ”What is

‘this about?”

Before giving away any plot
summaries or interpretations, one
must consider that The Dead is
adapted directly from a short sto-
ry. Therefore, the language and
dialogue are the key to under-

After reviewing my feeble
monetary capacity, I conclud-
ed there was no way to avoid
seeing friends and relatives
scowl after tearing open their
gaily wrapped Christmas
presents.

I kicked the covers off last
night and stared at the shining
digital display on my _clock
radio.

As the eerie blue l_ight
burned the image of 4 a.m.
into my retina, I discovered a
solution to my annual
dilemma. _

I'll take what cash I can bear
to part with, invest in some in-
expensive blank tapes and
record all the free new albums
I've gotten writing reviews for
The Pitt News this year! Then
I'll put all the tapes in over-
sized boxes, so my friends
think they're getting some-
thing tremendous.

Sure, the story is fictional, but it's
literary fiction by an originally ex-
pressive writer.

One wonders if Joyce would
be impressed by the screen ver-
sion of his short story, or rather
just by the film media itself. Since
his day, movie making has ad-
vanced from an industry with no
future at the beginning of the cen-
tury to the technically modern
and successful cultural attraction
of today.

Most of the action in this film
takes place through dialogue, so
it's crucial to pay attention to

what the characters are saying‘

and thinking.

Both Huston, as Gretta, and
McCann, as Gabriel, are dis-
traught. Gretta flashes back to her
youth after a song strikes up a
memory she has harbored,_but of
which she has never spoken.

Her closing performance is
touching, full of authentic emo-
tions that awakento passion. The
character of Gretta is far removed
from Huston’s richly flamboyant
portrayal of the trashy Maerose in
Prizzi’s Honor, a -role for which
she received an Oscar. As Gret-
ta, Huston is refined, mature and
rather mysterious with her far-off
expression.

Gabriel is concerned, like most
Dubliners of the era, about
Ireland's sovereignty. He_ also
contemplates whether the talk he
has prepared for the party guests
is appropriate or beyond their
comprehension.

Throughout the film, he tries to
combat his own insecurity, espe-
cially his uncertainty about the
covenant of love. '

This last ideal is the whole fo-
cus of the film: Gabriel's love for
Gretta, his aunts and the city, and

Gr'e_tta’s past love for a young, dy-

But which albums should I

I wouldn't give Motley Crue to

Sure, that's it — I'll give gross
music to my enemies, and
eventually, they'll listen to it
out of curiosity. I can cause
them pain even when I'm not
present!

Finally content, I drifted off
to sleep.

Huston believed Joyce's short sto-
ry was one of the greatest stories
in the English language.

Huston uses layers of visual de-
tail, as in his classic The Maltese
Falcon, for the film to take on a
specific meaning but with un-
deryling dimensions. Thus, the
film's slow pace has a purpose:
Minimal physical action permits
extended visuality.

The Dead has been received
with enthusiasm -at screenings in
Venice, Montreal and Dublin
film festivals. It will open around
the country in mid-December.

their seats, watching the various
dancers’ antics inspired by Win-

Another ”surprise” was Win-

This ended up being a humorous
piece as well since, as he played,
he constantly had to change har-

monicas holding one in each
hand and another awaiting its
cue, resting on the piano keys.

Songs from Winston's albums

December, ‘Autumn and the
soundtrack of The Velveteen Rab-
bit were performed. At the end of
the show, Winston received a
standing ovation and played two

encore selections from The
Snowman, ‘a seasonal children's
story. This, then, encouraged
another standing ovation from the
audience. ,

After the performance, in a
backstage room called ”The
Green Room,” some family
members and friends gathered to
hear more of Winston's compo-
sitions.

Once again, Rush returns in time for finals

By Jeff Maffe
Staff Writer

It seems that every time they
come to Pittsburgh, they come
during finals. It's not a very good
time for many students to just
drop everything and hurry to the
arena for a concert, but if you're
free on Dec. 16 for the Rush
show, get there.

Rush is a hard-rocking band
from Canada. They began as a
garage _band in the very early '70s
and gained popularity with the
release of their first album, Rush,
and the song ”Working Man.”

There are only three members
in this band, and all three excel
at what they do. Bassist Geddy

talented musicians to be seen or

heard. Watching this man play
three instruments on stage at the
same time — well and with ease
— is a sight that all music lovers
should be able to appreciate.

Guitarist Alex Lifeson is very
talented as well, and paying close
attention to any Rush song rev-
eals this. He is capable of creat-
ing obscure chords that fit well
into the band's songs, and his so-
los, unlike those of many other
rock guitarists, flow as a part of
the song instead of sticking out
like a sore thumb.

Finally, there is drummer Neil
Peart. He is the only one of the
trio who is not an original mem-
ber of the band. He replaced John

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December l0, T987 .

Rutsey after the release of the
band's first album and has stayed
to become the band's songwriter
as well. _

He is not just a drummer, but
a percussionist too. There aren't
too many people who can com-
pete with this man besides Carl
Palmer, Stewart Copeland and
the late John Bonham. He is a
treat to watch onstage.

Rush always brings a great
stage show with them, complete
with lasers, lights and a giant
movie screen that is set up be-
hind, the stage and utilized
throughout most of the show.

Of course, with the talent that
these musicians have, the music

 

for the last 13 years has been in-
credible. Some feel that the band
has sold out to synthesizers and
computerized, high tech junk
over the last three or four albums.

Regardless, Rush will play
many songs from the new album
in order to promote this latest ef-
fort, Hold Your Fire. Next, you'll
hear all of the classics the rest of
the evening, from ”Xanadu” and
”Fly By Night” to ”Tom Sawyer”
and ”New World Man.”

Tommy Shaw of Styx fame will
be the opening act for Rush at the
Arena Wednesday, Dec. 16. See
this show if you have the chance.
You will not regret it.

passing  

exemplify Porter's ,
well—rounded game

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

Darelle Porter is shooting only
29 percent from the floor and
averaging a ‘measly 4.7 points per
game, but he's averaging 25
minutes through Pitt's first three
games. So he must be doing
something right. Right?

”Darelle does a lot of little
things well. He might not show
up big on the stat sheet, but he
does a lot of good things for us,”

said Pitt coach Paul Evans.

”If you had 10 Darelle Porters,
you wouldn't have to worry

.about [intensity]. That kid just

comes to play. He wants to play,
and he works realhard every
time out there,” he added.
Porter, a 6-foot-3‘/2 freshman
guard from Pittsburgh's Perry

I High School, is second on the

team in assists (1 7) behind fresh-
man guard Sean Miller.

That shouldn't come as such a
surprise because the strength of
Porter's game has always been in

I ‘ passing.

During Porter's senior year at
Perry, he averaged eight assists
per game. ‘

Evans" said if the need arised
Porter could even play point
guard against a zone defense be-

V cause ”he’s such a good passer.”

In Pitt’s\first three games, Port-
er has displayed his strong pass-
ing skills, _ handing out eight
assists against St. Francis and
seven against Chicago State.

Porter's game definitely ap-
pears to have an unselfish quali-
ty, but he doesn't want anyone to
think it's because he can't shoot.

”Since I broke my finger, I look
to pass first, but before then I was
shooting pretty well, and I had a
total game,” Porter said. ”Now
my shooting’s not as good, so I'm
looking to pass.”

Evans said Porter's broken
finger (on his left hand) will prob-
ably not be completely healed
until January.

”His shot’s off right now. Every ’

time he gets [his finger] bumped,
it bothers him a little bit. Once he

starts shooting better it will be a’

big plus,” Evans said.

Two other injuries on the Pitt
team have led to the increase in
Porter's playing time.

Freshman Jason Matthews has
started Pitt's first three games at
off—guard and Demetreus Gore
has been playing small forward in
place of Rod Brookin, who has
been out with a separated
shoulder. I

But Gore is still not complete-
ly recovered from his injury
either — a bad ankle —, and he's
averaging only 19 minutes.

Porter has been Gore's replace-
ment, although Porter's more‘
natural position is the ‘ off—guard
spot. .

Despite Porter's lack of size,
Evans said’ he can handle the
small forward position. ”lt’s nice
if we want to go with three

guards, because Darelle’s still

strong enough to handle that
spot. In a zone we lose some
height, but he still can rebound
well enough.” _

Said Porter, ’’I’m happy with
the playing time I'm getting._I
didn't think I would get that
much, but due to the [injury] situ-
ation I'm getting more time than
I. expected.” , ~

Porter was listed by Eastern
Basketball as one of the top 125
high school seniors in the coun-
try, but many thought he would
be a late-bloomer in college, a

4 player who wouldn't contribute

until his junior. or senior year.
”I think that's what people
thought. I never think that. I al-
ways hope for the best with any
[freshman]. I've seen freshman
who came in that had great, great
backgrounds and didn't do so
well. Whereas some other kids

‘_ I've recruited hadn't had tremen-

dous backgrounds and had
fabulous [college] careers,” Evans
said.

”I think it's a big difference be-
tween high school and your first
year in college.” '

Evans said Porter has picked up
Pitt's system much faster than he
expected, and by the third week
ofpractice Porter was telling the
veterans at times where they
were suppossed to be on the

Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver?
When was the last time anybody
heard anything about him? The
Steelers, as well as Lipps, claim
a hamstring injury has chained
him to the injured reserve list.
Since the NFLPA strike? A ham-
string?? I don't know. Something

 

 

Thursday, December IO, 

is fishy.

0 Last year the Kansas City
Chiefs were a 10-6 ballclub and
qualified for the playoffsias a wild
card, where they lost to the New
York Jets 35-15. Then, in celebra-
tion of making the playoffs for the
first time since 1971, the Kansas
City front office fired head coach
John Mackovic. Supposedly,
eight or so players privately com-
plained to the guys in the busi-
ness suits that Mackovic wasn't
doing the job. So special teams
coach Frank Ganszn was hired for
1987. It's now 1987, and the
Chiefs are a ferocious 2-IO.~To
the KC front office: Ha, ha ha.
Good for ya.

Freshman Darelle_Porter does the little things well for the Panthers.

Now that Pitt has its easiest

games in the past, it's time to
, play some good (yes, good)
basketball teams.

After easy home victories
over Robert Morris, St. Francis
and Chicago State by an aver-
age of 23 points, the Panthers
will play their next five games
on the road — and against
stiffer competition.

Plus, the ‘Panthers next
home game (Jan. 2) is against
nationally ranked Florida. ‘

The 3-0 Panthers play at
West Virginia this Saturday af-
ternoon at 2 pm,‘ Pitt is 1-13
against the Mountaineers at
the West Virginia Coliseum

”It’s a great game for us. We
need that going into the Big
East. With that kind of crowd
and pressure defense, we'll get
these kids a chance to make
another step to the position
they need to be in,” said Pitt
coach Paul Evans.

The Panthers travel to Rich-.
field, Ohio, to play Akron
Dec. 21. Pitt plays Jacksonville
in Florida Dec. 26, Florida
State Dec. 28 in the opening
round of the Citrus Bowl Tour-
nament in Orlando and either
Alabama or Central Florida in

‘the final round of the tour-
nament. ' i

' Evans likes the chancelfor "

his four freshman to play in
some tough games in some
tough places before league
play begins in January. ’’If you
played at home the next five
games and then went to _
Georgetown, it could be a 4
shock. Whereas by,.the time
we get to Georgetown (Jan. 6),
these kids are going to have
[experienced] almost any situ-
ation you could be in.”

Added Pitt freshman Darelle
Porter, ”This will get us pre-
pared for the Big East. In case
we get it in a crucial situation,"
we'll already have been in
some crucial situations."

court during the team's intra-
squad games.

Another of Porter's strengths
may be that he understands his
role. He hasn't come into the Pitt

program and tried to be a star, ala -

Charles Smith or Jerome Lane.
Said Porter, ’’I just go out there

and try to do the little things right, A

and I don't try to do bigthings.”
Evans said it was those intrica-
cies that appea|ed.to him when

he recruited Porter. ’’I liked his
passing and the way he ran the
floor and his intensity.

”The kids that are good enough
to play in the Big East — a lot of
times you'll see them in high
school games and. they don't
have to play hard to score or
whatever because they're so
good. Whereas Darelle showed
intensity every night no matter
who he was playing against."

Bucs continue suit vs. Parker

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

DALLAS — Dave Parker's attor-
neys may try to reach an out-of-
court settlement to the $5.7 mil-
lion breach-of-contract lawsuit
filed against the six—time All-Star
outfielder by the Pittsburgh
Pirates‘because of his admitted
cocaine use.

Because of the suit, the Pirates

' say they won't make a scheduled

Jan. 1 deferred payment of
$997,000 to Parker, who testified
in federal court 18 months ago
his cocaine use led to a decline
in his play.

The payment in January is the
first due Parker under the five-
year, nearly $8 million contract
he signed after winning the Na-
tional League Most Valuable
Player award for the Pirates in
1978. The contract included $5.7
million in deferred money and
was then the largest ever signed
by a major league player.

"We’re not going to pay it next
month,” Carl F. Barger, the
Pirates’ recently elected presi-
dent, said Tuesday."'What we'll
likely decide to do is put the
[$997,000] in escrow until the
case is decided  but we don't
intend to pay it to Dave Parker.”

The Pirates, claiming Parker
breached the contract not only by
frequently using cocaine but also
by hiding that use from the team,
filed a federal lawsuit in April
1986 aimed at blocking the
deferred payments.

The suit, filed by the ownership
group that bought the Pirates
from the John W. Galbreath fami-
ly in October 1985, claims Par-
ker also violated the contract by
misrepresenting his physical con-
dition. Parker agreed in the con-
tractto keep himself in playing
shape and to inform the team of
any health problems.

"This suit disgusts me,’ said
Tom Reich, Parker's Pittsburgh-
based agent. "My attitude is the
case never had any merit. I've al-
ways felt it was very unfair that
he was being singled out."

But while Reich said he is "not
very sympathetic to a settle-

I

ment,” U.S. District Courtludge.

Glenn Mencer has urged both
sides to settle the case, and both"
Reich and Barger said it is a pos-

sibility.

”This case has been such an in-
trusion on [Parker's] Iife," Reich
said. "But in spite of how distaste-
ful I might find the process, you
can never rule out any options."

Barger denied the Pirates in-
itiated the.suit out of dislike for
Parker, whose offensive produc-
tion slipped noticeably in his fi-
nal Pirates’ seasons. Barger also
has denied the team's budget-
conscious new owners are look-
ing for a legal loophole in which
they can save millions of dollars.

"This is not _a personal vendet-
ta,” Barger said Tuesday night.
"But this is serious stuff. We don't
feel we should pay him the
money."

During his September 1985
testimony in the federal cocaine
trial of former Philadelphia Phil-
lies clubhouse caterer Curtis
Strong, Parker admitted he used
cocaine for several years and that
it caused a noticeable deteriora-
tion in his play.

Parker testified he used cocaine
infrequently while playing winter
ball in the 19705 and after the
Pirates won the World Series in
1979 and gradually increased his

drug use until quittingin 1982,
just before his final season in
Pittsburgh.

Parker signed as a free agent
with Cincinnati in 1984 and
played there for four years until
being traded to the Oakland Ath-
letics on Tuesday.

Once regarded as baseball's
finest player, Parker won con-
secutive NL batting champion-
ships in 1977 (.338) and 1978
(.334) and combined for 51
homers and 205 RBI those two
seasons. He slumped to a .270
average, with six homers and 29
RBI during an injury-shortened
1982 ‘season, then hit .279 with
12'homers and 69 RBI in 1983.

His numbers improved dramat-
ically after he signed with the
Reds. He hit .312 with 34 homers
and an NL-high 125 RBI in 1985.

Parker's attorneys — the out-
fielder has changed law firms
once since the suit was filed — in-
itially argued that the case should
be decided by a baseball arbitra-
tor rather than in a federal court.
The 3rd U.S. Circuit-Court of Ap-

peals upheld the Pirates’ suit last
spring and assigned it to Mencer.

‘The case is in the discovery
stage, where both sides formulate
their strategy and take written
depositions. Parker gave a written
deposition to Pirates’ attorneys
last summer in Pittsburgh.

If the case is not settled out of
court, it should go -to trial some-
time in late 1988, Barger said.

Barger is managing partner of
the Pittsburgh law firm of Eckert,
Seamans, Cherin & Mellott,
which is handling the case for the
Pirates. Barger was the team's
secretary and general counsel un-
til being elected president last
week.

Reich said Barger’s firm has
represented him in personal legal
matters and ''I like Carl Barger 
but the case disgusts me.”

Parker's contract was negotiat-
ed by the Galbreaths and former
General Manager Harding ”Pete"
Peterson. The Pirates’ current
owners, Pittsburgh Associates, as-
sumed the financial obligations to
Parker when they bought the
team from the Galbreath family.
