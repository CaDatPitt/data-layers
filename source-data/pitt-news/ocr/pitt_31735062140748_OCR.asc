Air Corps Officers Praise
Pitt, Welcome Air Crew,

First official news of the Air Combat Crew Cadet Candidates was released today by,
Public Relations Ofﬁcer Lt. William L. Levenson. At an assembly in the Stephen Fosterl
Memorial, Commanding Officer Major E. R. Bartholomew welcomed the men to Pitt and 
gave them certain recommendations concerning their attitude toward the University and-‘ in y
the city. l ' '
9 He expressed his appreciation towards the University and its officials for their “fine _

cooperation, willingness, and excellent spirit.” He stated that Pitt is the finest University, 
that he knows of for the type of training which they will receive. 
 ~. . ., Major Bartholomew explained that Pitt is the ﬁrst uniu  “7
 versity in the country to receive this entirely new method  
i training. He told the cadets how fortunate they are to bd 
, able to take this Air Combat Crew Training. ' O

but it will not be worked on a proﬁt basis. .

Lt. Levenson told the men that no automobiles will be.
allowed while they are in training. A reception room ‘will be =
set up for the men to receive relatives and friends who come, .
to visit them. _'

When questioned about the cadets’ social life, the _ -
Lieutenant explained that they would meet Pitt coeds at _
formal functions held expressly for the cadets. The cadets, 
will have Saturday evening and all day Sunday off, to do \
what they please unless reviews are ‘scheduled for this 
time. They will always have to be present for retreat. . ,

I lNew Air Raid Regulations
A For Cathedral Are Outlined

_ In order to conform to the new alert system ordered by V
the Army and instituted by the Civilian Defense organiza- , 
tion, the Cathedral of Learning will follow these rules dur-
ing future alerts. - _
The following is the new sequence of signals that will ,_j
P, be used over the Cathedral siren system:  
Preliminary alert—two-minute continuous blast.
P Action alert——two-minute intermittent blast. .

First all-clear—two-minute continuous blast.
I Final all-clear—ﬁve short blasts. 7
A ; People within the Cathedral of Learning will respond on- 
‘ ly to the Cathedral siren signals. Outside signals will be dis— ’
; regarded.
._, On the sounding of the preliminary alert, windows will
. be closed. During the daytime, shades will be left as they
: were. At night, however, all shades must be drawn at this
; signal so that no direct light can show outside. If the prelimi-
 nary alert is followed quickly by the action alarm, do not
- wait to draw shades. Close windows and evacuate at once.
 On the sounding of the action alarm, all classrooms and
_. voﬂices will be evacuated promptly. Classes ‘will follow the
’ routes marked out for them on the Air Raid Instruction post-
‘lers, ‘when provided, in going to their shelter areas. The per-
i  son in charge of each room is responsible for all lights being

On the sounding of the first all-clear, people will leave
the shelter areas and return to the rooms whence they had

the doors being closed,but not locked, when

- come. If it is a night alert, the shades will be left drawn and
«the windows closed, for the dimout will still be in force.

On the sounding of the ﬁnal all-clear, shades may be
raised and the windows re-opened.
.. g NOTE CAREFULLY: The ﬁrst all-clear may——and prob-
A ably will be—succeeded by a second action alarm. If a second
action alarm is sounded, immediately follow the same routine
as provided for by the instructions for the original action

The air corps cadets arrived
with the dawn.

As a matter of fact,_it was be-
fore dawn when the crowded troop
train rolled into the Union Station
on Friday morning. Army officers,
photographers, and a few newspa-
per reporters were their only rc-
ception committee.

They were tired after their
long ride from Atlantic City.-—
and hungry. But most of all they
were puzzled. Yet they smiled,
waved, and posed from the time
they saw the ﬁrst “gentlemen of
the press” until they boarded
chartered streetcars and headed
toward the Cathedral.

They were still smiling when

Cadets Arrive Tired, Hungry, Puzzled 

marched in double ﬁle on to the
lawn. And they were still puzzled.
Some of them did not know what
city they were in; very few knew
that they were entering the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

Two questions had to be an-
swered for every group of sol-
diers as they stood in formation
and waited. “Where are we?”
and “Is it co-educational?” They
were pleased about both answers.

When the last of the 432 soldiers

had marched up the walk before
the Ffth Avenue entrance, the en-

tire group formed into platoons.

It was impressive, to say the
least, and both spectators and sol-
diers were impressed. The soldiers

Oﬂicers shouted instruct-ihns,

and “those who have studied
higher mathematics” formed a

' small group of their own. Small

white cards were distributed and
the cadets learned on what door
they were to “set up housekeep-

  -Friday, February 26, 1943.-——This morning, in the cold,

 smog of Pittsburgh-at-six-thirty, 432 air-crew cadets

 in Union Station, vaguely anticipating a new phase in

if he process of their education for war. _ L

.  Today they began to feel out their new living quarters.

Cathedral of Learning is quite different from an army
 The sound of G-I shoes on stone ﬂoors is another sound
I l than that of the same shoes on muddy earth. Vaulted Gothic
l arches are a contrast to wooden cross-beams.

, L Today there came up the elevator shaft to us the good,

3 rich smell of great quantities of army food cooking. This was
I L Wthe year-of'—war 1943.

, . "_ For the next few months in the University there will
“exist, side by side, the military and the civilian, khaki and
§“inufti. ‘

 A’ The News has printed a list of the courses which will be

3 taught the cadets. In some respects it is a fuller and a more

.« valuable education, hour for hour, than any which has ‘ever’
“ ‘been offered you or us. It is an intensive curriculum, oﬁered

 ’ “to a group selected for their more-than—average ability.

It is a heartening thing that the liberal arts should still
go on in time of war. Certainly the totalitarian rulers do not
 _, permit the pursuit of the arts, except as they may be cm-
L , -ployed to further nationalistic and militaristic purposes.

It should.be_remembered that the cadets stationed here_
p are students of a different sort than the rest of us. They are
S ' here for no four years of leisurely learning. They are not tak-
 ing an education; an education is being giving them, with no
electives and no class cuts. For them, it is‘ a brief, compact
jtrainihg period and then off to the battlefronts of the world.

 I «r .They may like the Cathedral;tthey may not. Some have
said already that they do. They can not, like so many peace-
ﬁétime Pitt students, look to the Cathedral as a four-year home
;\and a place to return to, later, for alumni reunions.

S" For these cadets, Pitt is but one stop _in a long journey.

_ These boys come from the big and little towns of the
United States. They are the sons of truck-drivers, grocers,
yfarmers, millworkers, bankers, and ﬁshermen. They. have
_ been called together by crisis from the big and little “towns.

V. This stop in their journey brings them to Pittsburgh, a
strange city’ full of strange people. The street-cars that
«jbrought them to Oakland were not like the street-cars and
buses of their own home towns. They had not had time to
know each other very well, nor would they have time to know
very well the people they were about to meet. _
 You will not have with them as much contact as you
« ‘j have with your fellow students. In what contact you do have
V ‘with them, it would be well toremember that they are not
if?‘ so far removed from civilian life. They have not yet “ﬁlled
 their uniforms.” . » A -

They won’t appreciate gawking any more than they will
‘ ;appreciate snubbing. Social amenities should be normal; they
should be neither forced nor overly restrained.

The faculty, administration and students of the Uni-
 ; versity extend welcome to the newcomers. How hearty, how
’ ‘'1 sincere that welcome turns out to be will depend on all of us.

Thelma Weitzen, transfer from

all of her free time with Phi Ep

true. i

Idle thoughts—-Wouldn’t it be ter-
rible if the University got enough
money to put new lights in the sec-

shalls. .

First calamity of the “Knicker-

Thompson last Friday when she
tore her ﬁngernail off on her part-

girls rehearsed with the boys and
naturally June was a little nervous.

New Year of Buying Jeeps

Having established itself as a
campus institution for the dura-

tion by doing an outstanding job
*-for the past three semesters, the
University stamp and bond drive
is now going ahead with plans to

make the present term its best.
The totals for the drive have
already surpassed the $30,000

‘ mark, a ﬁgure far exceeding the

conservative pre-campaign esti-
hates.

On February 18, the committee

celebrated the ﬁrst anniversary of

’ the drive, which was initiated by

Herbert Gall, M43. now a ﬁrst
lieutenant in the Army Air Corps

* in Texas. The idea for a stamp and
-{bond drive came soon after the
" Japanese bombing of Pearl Har-
 "on December 7, 1941.

l c

' " ‘In April of last year, the com-
mittee sponsored a General Mac-
Arthur Day to honor the work

being done in the Paciﬁc. Sales
for this day set a record of over
$3,200, a total which has never
since been surpassed.

During that ﬁrst semester, stu-
dents and faculty purchased more
than $15,600 in stamps and bonds.

Although no deﬁnite plans were
made for a drive to be held during
the summer trimester, Druids, na-
tional honorary activities frater-
nity for sophomore men, took over
the work.

Last semester, however, the
committee brought about a reor-
ganization in its personnel and
methods of selling the stamps
and bonds. A new plan was in-
augurated whereby the progress

, of the drive was graphically re-
corded in terms of what the re-
ceipts equalled as measured in
jeeps.

was assumed to havethe power of

providing the Army with one jeep.

At a program held in Memorial

all on the anniversary of 'our en-
trance into the war, the committee
outlined their work and officially
presented the ﬁrst few jeeps to the
Army.

Each jeep the University pur-
chased is marked with the in-
signia of the University. To date,
the committee has been notiﬁed
of the purchase of 26 jeeps last
semester, and two, so far this
semester.

The jeeps are purely symbolic
of the type of use to which the
government can put the funds ob-

’ tained in the sales of bonds.

Chairman of the present com-
mittee is Ruth Becker, Ed44; sec-
retary, Ruth Swanson, Ed44; and
publicity director, William Pan-

“While the boys are away, the’

clares Viola Stevenson. Viola is the
ﬁrst woman student to be admitted
into the School of Chemical En-
gineering at the University.

She’ always wanted to study en-
gineering, but too often was dis-
couraged by male friends who
called engineering a “man's job."

one point«a West Virginia rooter

urged to form bowling teams to

{participate in a tournament spon-
jsored by WAA. Women’s organ-

izations refer to any fraternity or

if 7'non—fraternity group on campus.

The teams should be formed this

r Week without any delay in order

that activity may begin immediate-
ly. Due to the lack of gymnasium
facilities, WAA is turning its at-

’: tention to a sport which will en-

 

able the use of facilities outside of
the university.

Any of the women’s organiza-
tions interested in participating in
a round-robin tournament, are ask-
ed to turn in names of members
of their team—which shall consist
of ﬁve players plus any desired

pnumber of alternates—to the Dean
of Women’s Oﬂice before Friday,

March 5. Be certain that the name
of the captain of the team is in-

dedicated.

Here is a ﬁne opportunity for

some friendly competition between

There were two very important
members of this season’s basketball
Squad who never were uniforms,
were never kissed by the coach, and
who never got their names into the
boxscore, let alone the headlines.

Jack Foley and Harold Cohen

were the anonymous members of
the team. Jack is the slim dark-

haired boy who sat in the press box
and kept the scorebook. Harold ran
the clock at all the home games.

But the aforementioned duties
were only a small part of their job.
Their other duties were even less
glamorous although necessary. Bas-

ketball practice started at four-
thirty, but one of the boys always
had to get there a half hour earlier.
It was his duty to change the tow-
els in they lockers, bring out the
equipment, and get the locker room
in readiness for the arrival of the
players.-

When the players did arrive it
was the duty of the manager to pass
out any needed medical supplies.
With practice under way, one of
the managers always prepared the
hot chocolate. The hot chocolate
diet was instituted by Dr. Carlson
when getting ice cream became too
difficult.

Ordinarily the two managers so
systemized their jobs that the one
who opened the practice session
could leave when the other arrived,
usually in the middle of practice.
The “closing” manager put the
equipment away and passed around
fresh medical supplies.

On the trips Jack Foley always
took care of the tickets, the meals,
hotels, and seeing that the players

got on the right train and at the
right time. Needless to say, he
never lacked for things to worry
about .His most harrowing ex-
perience, however, was last year
when the team went up to West
Point for the Army game.

Right up to the time the train
reached East Liberty it looked like
the squad was going to go minus
Tay Malarkey who had somehow
managed to miss it. Jack spent a
frantic half hour making arrange-
ments with conductors and porters,
and Malarkey ﬁnally did make the
train in East Liberty.

Harold Cohen has been called to
active duty with the Air Corps Re-
serves and by this time should be
in- Miami Beach. Jack Foley is an
advanced course R.O.T.G. student
and expects the call to duty some-
time before the summer.

SPORTS EDITOR

The recent sub-zero temperatures serve to remind us
that Pitt baseball is, or at least should be, just around the
corner. The major leagues may just be ‘getting used to
“spring” training minus the beneﬁts of California and Flor-
ida, but Pitt baseball has always been synonymous with snow,
ice, sleet, wind, and frostbite. A

Not, you understand, that the early “spring” drills are
ever held out of doors. They are conducted in one of the sub-

terranean depths of the Stadium appropriately labeled Mit-

terling Field. However, the only difference we were ever
able to discover between having our athletes train indoors
instead of outdoors is equivalent to the difference between
spending a winter on the Siberian plains or in a refrigerated
boxcar. In other Words, one has sides.

Of course, the air-conditioned Mitterling Field undoubt-
edly has its points. It does not, for instance, encourage lazi-
ness on the part of the players. They keep in motion all the
time, chieﬂy because it is a question of either moving around
or freezing to death and the instinct for self preservation is
still pretty strong.

Mitterling Field also sports as excellent an obstacle
course as has ever been constructed. Its steel beams, props,
and cranes that bisect it at various intriguing and incon-
venient angles add much to the training of our athletes.‘ The
boy who can knock base hits through that series of ob-
structions would be a slugger anywhere. _

The art of baserunning is a precarious, but interestingly
different business here, for not only must the player learn
how to avoid ﬂying spikes, but also how to avoid decapitation

‘by one of the jutting beams _and props. . . V
This part of practice did not concern us personally, but

the weather did. But this year-we are prepared. Our over-

’ coat, snowshoes, earmuffs, and fur-lined hood are ready. So,

Play Ball!

..____..._..__...__.

We also wish’ to make note of the departure of out it C

basketball writer, Mr. MikefHerman, for. the army. Mr. Her-
man would ‘be saying goodbye himself somewhere on this

page, were it not for thefact that he unfortunately jumped

' the gun several months ago. At. that time, you see, Mr. Her-,
man happened to read the wrong edition of the paper (and,.
-forgetting that you should believe nothing you hear and only .
half of what you ‘see, concluded that he would be‘. gone ere

the new semester rolled around. .

So Mr. Herman wrote a farewell column in which .lie'

thanked everyone for the privilege of having known them,
said nice things about people in particular, and in general
dispensed good feelings and good cheer.

Only when the new semester rolled around, Mr. Herman
was still here. Furthermore, he was somewhat in the posi-

tion of the man supposed dead who returns to embarass.

the writers of his obituaries. But in this case it was Mr.

,Herman who said the nice things about people. » -

And then people were always coming up to him and
saying, “Are you still here. I thought you were gone . . . ”

and the explanations were always involved and rather futile. I

But this time Mr. Herman is really going. Goodbyes are-in
order and we hereby submit ours. . = 9

Cadet nntry

Last Friday the air cadet candidates entered the Ca-
thedral of Learning which is the center of the University
of Pittsburgh. . . ‘

Last Sunday was Charter Day at the University—a
day to commemorate the beginning of what was to grow
and become the Pitt which these air cadet candidates

have now entered. -

On a cold day in 1787 thelvillage of Pittsburgh‘ was

N. slightly agog. It was about to. acquire a new school.
.. Almost as signiﬁcant as that day when Pittsburgh

Academy was founded is the day last week when the
army men arrived to begin training.‘ It is for their bene-
ﬁt that we write this story. It is their formal introduc-
tion to the University of Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh Academy grew after its founding on Feb-
ruary 27, 1787, and in 1819 was rechartered as the West-
orn University of Pennsylvania. The famous WUP turn-

 

  

ed out leaders from its technical schools such as the school
of medicine, law, and engineering. Between 1845 and the
end of the Civil War, it was given a rugged endurance
test. Two ﬁres threatened the University during that time.
The ﬁrst, in. 1845, destroyed the original Academy site,
and the second which occurred in 1849 and destroyed the
new school on Duquesne Way.

- For the next 14 years, the University was but a col-
lection of funds and plans for reorganization. In 1855,
this reorganization became a reality and a new build-
ing was erected at Ross and Diamond streets. here WUP
survived the Civil War era.

In 1882 the University was again moved. This time it
located itself in Allegheny City which is now called North
Side. And again in 1908, the location was changed. This
time it was moved to Oakland and with Samuel Black

Pittsburgh. 2 A  
After the first World War, new problems had to  
solved. The University was overcrowded and badly in;
debt. Dr. John G. Bowman, the present head of the school.‘ .-
became chancellor in 1921 and debts were soon 
Chancellor Bowman inaugurated the project of building L,
the Cathedral of Learning. After much planning a!)d"€X-
pert salesmanship campaigns, he convinced "Pittsburghers
that such a building was the solution to Pitt's problems. _
The Cathedral of Learning is the result. It is the
only structure of its kind in the world and thousands of.
visitors come annually to see it. 4
Today another World War threatens the normal life
of the University. With the arrival of the air corp cadet
candidates a new chapter in the history of Pitt has begun.

Continuing their morale building
activities Pitt ‘Players will present
“Knickerbocker Holiday” to the

,Faculty Club Saturday night in

“ Foster Memorial.

Public performances will be
given Wednesday, Thursday, and

' r Friday, March 17. 18, and 19 at
-- 8:15 o’clock.

‘ true American spirit. Further in-

“Knickerbocker Holiday” was
chosen to end the Pitt Players sea-
son because it is a timely satire of
and illustrates the

ﬂuencing the choice was the fact
that it will be the last dramatic

 presentation for the duration. Play-

‘ers are fortunate at this time to

have available more actors than

‘ever before. In addition, members
so! the Men's Glee Club and the

University Orchestra, which are

'’ discontinuing their activity this
 semester, wanted one last chance
 to participate in a large presenta-
._: tion.

“With Buell B. »Whitehi1l direct-

 'mg the entire show, Theodore Fin-

ney, head of the Department of

‘Musical Appreciation, supervising

 the musical portions, and Curtis

Greenberg, C44, directing the men’s

and women's dance routines, Knick-
erbocker Holiday should be really
good,” claims Ed Rose, C44, pub-
licity agent for the show. “Enter-

out and risk their lives to go
against the policy of their govern-
ment.” Mr. Weston asserted.

The South American people are
more skeptical and realistic than
we are. They enjoy life and are
not always as worried and busy as
North Americans. This is evident
from their daily lives. Two of their
meals are very large and consist
of all kinds of meat. At present
they do have a meat surplus. Fol-
lowing the evening meal, which is
served at 10 o'clock at night, the

“Women are definitely looked

ning they are forbidden to leave

Drive Beginspl,

Headed By Cwcns, Druids

The University’s Victory Book
Drive, designed to collect books for
the service personnel, begins today
with the opening of a booth on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral.
Thursday will be the last day of
the drive, giving the students and
faculty of the University only
three days to contribute books.

Cwens, honorary activities fra-
ternity for sophomore women, and
Druids, sophomore men’s activities
fraternity, have been chosen by
the ESCG to organize and promote
this drive. The presidents of these
organizations, Jean Swope, C45.
and Wilbur Newstetter, C45, are
heading the drive and at the same
time taking charge of the schedul-
ing and shipment committee. Rob-
ert Verklin, C45, is publicity chair-
man for the entire drive. Diedre
Baird. will direct art and poster
work.

Cwens will be stationed at the
Victory Book Drive booth on the
ground floor every hour today, to-
morrow, and Thursday.

' All fiction books published af-
ter 1930 are requested. Western
oi‘ mystery stories of any pub-
lishing date will be accepted.

The present best sellers, the
books that are now being read, are
those wanted by soldiers. “They
are giving their all for our coun-
try; good reading material is the
least thing that the people of the
nation can give them,” said New-
stette1'.

“Student reservists being call-
ed to /active duty will appreciate

the want for good books in the
near future and can realize now
the need for giving what they
can,” he continued.

Books collected by this drive will
be turned over to the main Pitts-
burgh collecting depot, the (‘ar-
negie Library on Friday.

Army Arrives,-
Students Leave c

When the Army moved into the
Cathedral, the students moved out.
Relocating of many classes, school
ollices, and departments has caused
students to do a lot of walking dur-
ing the ten minute intermission be-
tween classes. Most of these class
changes have been from the Cathe-
dral to State Hall.

Within the Cathedral, the School
of Business Administration was
moved from the thirteenth to the
twenty-sixth floor. The oﬁices of
the Dean of Men, Pitt News, Owl,
Pitt. Players, and YMCA, all for-
merly on the eighth ﬂoor, have been
shifted to the thirtieth floor. The
University News Service, which
was also on the eighth floor, is now
located along with the Student

Health Service on the thirty-third, A

ﬂoor. The Military Department,
Music Appreciation, and Mathe-
matics Dcpartment occupied the
fourth ﬂoor but are now located. on
the sixteenth, twenty-third, and
twenty-fourth floor
The Dean of Women’s oﬂice is now
on the first and YWCA in 617 Ca-
thedral. «

 Receives New Acting Pitt News Publishes Guide

Editor As -l:r“ovaioIi Leaves

Party Tomorrow

For Pitt ERC

Esther Berland, C43, chairman of
ﬁve Emergency Student Govern-
ment Conimittee, announces that
a farewell party will be given for
Pitt Enlisted Army Reservists who
will depart in the next two weeks.

This is the initial social af’t'a'u-
presented by the ESGC. The fu-
ture soldiers will be feted lldarch 3

at 3:30 o’clock in the C'()1'nmon;<

' Room.

Elaine Biersdorfer, C44, chair-
man of the Social Committee, is as-

~_ sisted by Peggy Holland, Ed44,

Dick Kramer, 044, Sylvia Morri-

‘ son, Ed44, Herb Nicholas, E44, and

Lee McFadden, BA44. They, antici-
pate a crowd of 150 reservist
guests and approximately 200 well-
wishing students and faculty.

At present, John G. Bowman,
Chancellor of the University; R.
H. Fitzgerald, Vice Chancellor;
Elmer Allen Holbrook, dean of the
School of Engineering and Mines;
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of the
School of Business Administration;
Stanton C. Crawford, dean of the
College; and Einar W. Jacobson,
dean of the School of Education,
have been contacted with enthusi-
astic response. ‘

The entire affair will be given
over to fond farewells and last min-

‘ ﬂute reminiscing. There will be no

speeches and informality will be

ﬁle keynote of the day.

The war may prove a hard nut
to be cracked by some organizations
but to the creators of this year’s
Owl it is just another hurdle to be
leaped. V

With the calling to active duty
of August Trovaioli, C48, Editor
of the Owl, the publication staff
was in line for a revamping. When
the smoke had cleared away, Viola
Boydjieﬁ’, C44, WSGA 1*ep1*esenta-
tive, emerged as acting Editor. Ed-
ward Rose, C44, was appointed as-
sociate Editor and Arline Chak—

'mak, C43, as assistant editor.

At present the yearbook is al-
most complete. “The entire staff has
labored long and without pause to
present an edition to Pitt students

-that will vividly represent college
life,” said Trovaioli.

Trovaioli, who leav s in two
weeks for service with ncle Sam’s
Army, stated, “I have tried to in-
clude in this book an impression of
four years of college, two years of
which were under the strain of war-
time exhilaration. This Owl has
been treated not only from a des-
signed point of view but an asthetic
point of view. I know that under
the guidance of the new staff, the
Owl will be completed in the same
manner in which it was begun.”

As Aid To Air Cadets

Air-crew cadets should have no
trouble ﬁnding their way around
the University, but this little guide,
written somewhere on the third or
nineteenth or is it the forty—ﬁfth
ﬂoor, may make their orientation
easier.

Anyone with the temerity and
time to remove forty-one stories
of solid rock and peer into the
ground ﬂoor will find there the
various Tuck shops. The ﬂora
is nil and the fauna is just what

you’d expect to ﬁnd under forty-
one stories of rock.

One becomes quickly accustom-
ed to elevator schedules. (Editor's
note: ah - ha - ha - ha.) Elevators
painted green stop on the first to
thirty-sixth ﬂoor, excepting two,
three, seven and a horrid blank
wall where the eighth ﬂoor used
to be; express elevators stop by
means of a crowbar inserted
through the outer door; local ele-
vators stpp everywhere except in
girdles, lingerie, housecoats, going
up-but that was another job,
wasn’t it? E

Libraries are located on ﬂoors
ﬁve, six and seven, unless you want
the Petty-girls Room, as who
doesn’t and if you ﬁnd it tell us
where. '

Stephen Collins Foster memo-
rial is on the Forbes street side.
The capacity is somewhat limit-

: ed and we think it perhaps no-

cessary that you know the cor-
rect and accepted social pro-
cedure when you cannot "find a
seat: ﬁnd the smallest man in
‘the auditorium. throw him (flat)
on his back.

Grind your heel into his eyes,
lift him, insert a ﬁnger in each of
his nostrils, remove his nose quick-
ly from his face and turn him over
to the nearest usher. Be quick
about it, though, as someone may
by now have taken the seat and he
may be a little larger than the last
one.

This series may be continued un-
less someone ﬁnds our hiding place.
