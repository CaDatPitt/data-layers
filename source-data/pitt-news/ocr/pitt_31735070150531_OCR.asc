Letter from the Editor: Here’s to 225 years of progress at Pitt

Pitt’s humble origins started back when stu-
dents — then only men — learned in a small
-log cabin that housed The Pittsburgh Acad-
emy. Now, 225 years later, this University is
known for its academic and research advance-
ments, athletics and global outreach.

Pitt has come a longway in those 225 years.

The log cabin on the American frontier
would eventually give way to a location of the
University to a building in downtown Pitts-
burgh, and later to the Cathedral of Learning
in Oakland. -

In 1865, the Allegheny Observatory, which
holds the third-largestrefracting telescope in
the world, was donated to Pitt. In 1893, Wil-
liam Hunter Dammond became the Universi-

ty’s ﬁrst black graduate. In 1898, Pitt admitted 7

its ﬁrst female students, sisters Margaret and
Stella Stein, who tied for ﬁrst in their class. In
1936,]ohn Woodruff, running the 800-meter
event at the Olympic Games in Berlin, became
Pitt’s ﬁrst Olympic gold medal winner.

Through the years, Pitt has made progress
in the areas of academics, research, the arts
and athletics, and while names such as Jo-
nas Salk, Gene Kelly and Tony Dorsett stand
out as notable achievers in those categories,
hundreds of thousands of people have passed
through this University, leaving an indelible
mark upon this institution in their own re-
spective manners. .

It would be quite a feat to encapsulate all
of the achievements and history that this
University has to offer in 40 pages. With this

   

commemorative edition, we’ve tried to pres-
ent a collage of stories that will be enjoyable

for students currently taking classes in the’

Cathedral of Learning as well as those who
took classes in the same rooms 40 years ago.

It included rereading the charters that
established the University, both of which are
on display at Hillman Library. Reporters read
books about the Cathedral of Learning and
interviewed relatives of some of the Univer-
sity’s most formative personalities.

Our visual staff hashed through years of old
photographs to choose ones that represent

Pitt’s” achievements. Our goal was to create.

a balance of the school’s different aspects,
because it’s all of these intertwined that
makes Pitt one of the best places to learn in
the country. .

We hope that we were able to achieve a ﬁn-
ished product representative of the progress
made at this University. And as the year con-
tinues, we’1l publish more stories in our “225
Years” series to commemorate the school’s
history. _ ' ,

Here’s to 225 years of a University that has
contributed signiﬁcantly to the betterment of
society. There’s no tellingwhat this school and
those devoted to it —— teachers, administra-
tors, alumni, guests —- will be able to achieve
in the years to come.

Hail to Pitt!

Whenjohn G. Bowman arrived at Pitt in 1921 to
begin his new job as chancellor, he couldn’t ﬁnd
the campus and neither could his taxi driver.
Sixteen years later, ‘Bowman laid the ﬁnal
cornerstone into the ground of the Cathedral

 Commons, ﬁnishing a long, tumultuous proj-

ect that began two months after he became
chancellor. The 42-story Cathedral claimed the
title of being the tallest academic structure in
the Western Hemisphere, at 535 feet tall and a
noticeable feature of the University.

Despite the numerous setbacks due to the

Great Depression and stock market crash, the
' building — which turned 75 years old this year

— fulﬁlled Bowman’s wildest dreams.
“They shall ﬁnd wisdom here, and faith —
in steel and stone, in character and thought ——

_, they shall ﬁnd beauty, adventure, and moments
: of high victory,” he said during construction.

Uncertain ground

Bowman hired Philadelphia architect

Turn to Page 17 for a columnist’s
open letter to Chancellor john
Bowman arguing against the

Cathedral ofLearning’s construction.

Charles Zeller Klauder, an expert in Gothic

- design and an accomplished desigier of col-

legiate buildings — with previous works at
Yale, Princeton, Cornell and Duke. Both men
sought to evoke a triumph — but there was
initial dissent. ‘ ' V

“It was neither a temple,'nor an expres4

sion of courage,” Bowman said of Klauder’s
ﬁrst plan.

The architect insisted hisdesigns were
sound. Throughout 1924, they argued, and
the ﬂoor of Klauder’s apartmentbecame littered
with rejected sketches. _ ‘

In frustration one night, Klauder put on a
record from the opera Die Walkure, composed
by Richard Wagner. The two men listened to the
swelling music, waitingfor its culmination. The
music denied expectations — peaking again
and again. As they listened, they were.struck
by the composition’s majestic arcs. Two hours
later, they had a plan. ' b

On Friday, Nov. 6, -1924, in the University
Club, the plan was revealed. After Bowman
showed pictures of the plans —— a 52—story
building costing $10 million — the room fell
silent. _

William Holland, the former chancellor,

. criticized the plan, claiming that the proposed

site contained dangerous quicksand.
Bowman jumped to his feet, explaining

that engineers had designed a safe mechanism

around the quicksand. '
Holland apologized.

Money matters

The campaign for funding was a long and
arduousjourney, and many believed Pitt could
never raise the project’s required $10 million.

“My life is tied up in the idea that the pro-
posed structure will be the most beautiﬁil and

-outstanding building ever erectedfl am con-

ﬁdent that Pittsburgh will build it,” Bowman
wrote in a letter to Klauder on Dec. 2, 1924.
Traveling throughout the city, Bowman
sought help. He went to steel workers and their
families in Carnegie to promote the construc-
tion. He was met with enthusiasm. ‘

Awoman stood up with a baby in her arms

and said, “We have no money, butwe go Without
meat for aweek at our house and give you tha .”

Then, a man stood up. “I’ve got no money.
But I wear this suit of clothes another year and

give you the price of a suit of clothes,” he said. i

U.S. Steel, after a large kick-off dinner,’ do-
nated $250,000 inthe form of steel equipment.
It was one of the ﬁrst instances of corporate

‘ philanthropy, accordingto the historian Robert
- Alberts.

Beginning in March of 1924, Bowman start-
ed a series of radio talks discussing his vision
through the University’s campus radio.

As many as 97,000 local children donated a
dime apiece in the famous Buy a Brick campaign
to help ﬁmd construction. The idea, encouraged

Jonas Salk versus polio: the ﬁght that began, ended at Pitt

Amy Friedenberger & Zachary
Harr
The Pitt News Staff

Jonas Salk’s eldest son can still remember the
day in 1953 when he received his father’s ex-
perimental polio vaccine.

“One of the things I hated most in life were
needles,” Peter Salk said. “For some reason of
fate, it didn’t hurt.”

Peter Salk’s father, Dr. Jonas Salk, would
become one of the most venerated medical
scientists of the century just two years later.
On April 12, 1955, Salk and his research team
released the ﬁrst successﬁil vaccine for polio,
developed at Pitt while Salk headed a university
virology lab.

A crippling disease that affected tens of
thousands of lives each year around the peak
of its epidemic in 1952, polio, formally known
as poliomyelitis, is a viral disease that can affect
nerves and can lead to partial or full paralysis.

On the day of its release in 1955, people lined
up in the Cathedral of Learning and around the
country to receive the vaccination.

Coming to Pitt

Salk grew up in New York City and was the
ﬁrst member ofhis family to go to college. Origi-
nally enrolling at the City College of New York
to study law, he soon realized that he was inter-
ested in medicine and refocused his academic
efforts toward getting into medical school.

3601 Bivcffofte I

After he earned his medical degree at New
York University, Salk worked as a research fel-
low at the University of Michigan with his men-
tor, Dr. Thomas Francis, to develop an inﬂuenza
vaccine at the request of the U.S. Army.

In 1974, Salk became the head of the Virus
Research Lab at Pitt. While continuing work
on improving the ﬂu vaccine, he also started
studying the polio virus in the hope that he
could develop a vaccine for that, too.

“The opportunity in Pittsburgh was some-
thing that others did not see, and Iwas advised

 

 1; 
-: 

against doing something as foolish as that, be-
cause there was so little there,” Salk told the
Academy of Achievement when he was inducted
in 1976. “However, I did see that there was an
opportunity to do two things. One was to con-
tinue the work I was doing on inﬂuenza, and
two, to begin to work on polio. Thatwas avery
modest beginning.”

. With the help of the National Foundation
for Infantile Paralysis, Salk would_spend the
next eight years of his life developing avaccine

against polio.

tory. Courtesy University of Pittsburgh Archives Service Center

His family lived in the Wexford and Squirrel
Hill areas while he worked on the vaccine. Peter
Salk said that his fatherwas “very tied up in his
work,” but he still made some time to vacation
to Deep Creek, Md., to drive the farnily’s boat
while others water—skied.

Sticking to what he knew about vaccination
when developing the one for the ﬂu»— that
if the body could be artiﬁcially exposed to a
harmless form of a disease virus, the body will
then produce antibodies that resist or kill the
virus if later exposed to thesame strain — Salk
used formaldehyde to killthe virus while keep-
ing it intact, so as to have it trigger the immune
system. —

The breakthrough

Salk’s efforts paid off.
He started testing his vaccine ﬁrst on mon-

keys, then on patients at the Watson Home for '

Crippled Children, which housed children who
already had polio. In the next step, he inocu-

latedvolunteers,includinghislaboratorystafl, '

himself, his wife and their three sons with the
vaccine ‘made from the killed virus. Next came

, the “polio pioneers” —— the 1.8 million children

who received either a vaccine or a placebo in
testing trials .

“Once the injections started, Dr. Salk gave
them at the rate of one a minute,” wrotejohn
Troan in the Pittsburgh Press. “Yet he appeared

Pitt basketball program finds consistency in last decade

Kelly Flanigan
Stcyff Writer

In the last decade, Pitt men’s basketball
transformed into a prestigious and talented
program, envied in many corners of the
country.
But it hasn’t always been this way.

success, change and instability plagued the ' I

program, which was established in 1905.

But through it all, Pitt managed to at-
tract talent that maintained a certain level
of respectability, despite playing in subpar
facilities in the Fitzgerald Field House for
many years.

The foundation of today’s basketball pro-
gram, led by head coach Jamie Dixon, was
built by the recruiting ability and shared
hard—nosed mentality of Pitt’s former
coaches. ‘

After advancing to the Elite Eight in 1974,
the program has failed to reach this level
of competition again, earning bids to just
two NCAA;Tournaments in the next decade.

But that would change under Paul Evans,
head coach from 1986 to 1994, who amassed
a 147-98 all—time record as the leader of
the Panthers. His ﬁrst year as head coach
underwhelmed fans, as he ﬁnished with a
10-18 overall record, dropping 10 out of 11
Big East games injanuary 1986 alone.

Then-assistant—coachjohn Calipari, now
head of the storied University of Kentucky
basketball program, gained collegiate coach-
ing experience under Evans at Pitt.

As Evans learned to better utilize his tal-
ent on the court, his team earned Big East
regular-season titles in 1987 and 1988 and
several top-10 rankings in the polls. All-
Americans Charles Smith andjerome Lane
led the squad, followed by Sean Miller, Brian

“That was the Pitt dream team,” long-
time Pitt basketball fan Lorraine Dees said.
“Sean Miller was great to watch — he was
so smart on the ﬂoor. Charles Smith was
just fabulous — he was unbelievable. He
carried the team.” /

Dees, who has been attending Pitt bas-
ketball games since 1968, saw many teams
play_at the Fitzgerald Field House, where the
Panthers played their home games before
moving to the Petersen Events Center.

She recalls a signiﬁcant member of those
teams, Lane, who famously shattered the
backboard on a slam dunk during a 1988
contest against Providence.

“He wasn’t that tall, but he sure could
crash those boards,” Dees recollected.

Evans saw the Panthers to a No. 2 rank-
ing in the country overall. During his tenure
at Pitt, his teams advanced to ﬁve NCAA
Tournaments and one National Invitation
Tournament, but these postseason appear-
ances did not end in championships’.

Despite the wealth of talent on the Pan-
thers squad, Evans struggled in the early
’90s, and those failures eventually led to
his replacement by Ralph Willard, a highly
touted coaching prospect from Western
Kentucky.

After taking over in 19 94, Willard prom-
ised to rebuild the program by recruiting
big-time talent, including Mark Blount,

Vonteego Cummings, Michael Gill and Kel-
lii Taylor. But in his second year, Willard’s
hopes for a successful season were squashed
by Cummings’ nine-game recovery from a
hand injury and Taylor’s season—ending back
injury. Taylor also faced team disciplinary
issues. Despite Evans’ continued excellence
in recruiting, the team appeared in only one
NIT in his ﬁve-year tenure.

When Willard left Pitt to return to his
alma mater — Holy Cross — in 1999, Pitt
athletic director Steve Pederson hired rel-
atively unknown Northern Arizona head
coach Ben Howland, who took Pitt to its
ﬁrst NCAA Tournament appearance in nine
seasons.

“When Ben Howland arrived at Pitt, he
walkedjnto a dingy Fitzgerald Field House
and a tattered Pitt program,” said Chuck
Finder, a 25-year veteran sports writer and
columnist with the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette.

Finder was one of the ﬁrst members of _

the Pittsburgh media to meet and write
about Howland.

Howland’s ﬁrst order of business was to
dismiss senior star player Kellii Taylor from
the team due to disciplinary issues.

“Taylor was just another piece of remod-
eling the new guy was forced to undertake,”
Finder said.

For two hours twice a week, the Belleﬁeld
Hall auditorium swells with the sound
of some of the University of Pittsburgh-’s
most talented voices. Sopranos, altos,

_tenors, baritones and bassists take the
stage, blending together to form the
Heinz Chapel Choir, one of Pitt’s most
celebrated vocal ensembles.

The Heinz Chapel Choir features some
of the most gifted singers Pitt has to of-
fer, and the group has been doing so for
a long time. A very, very long time. The

“We need enough fairly simple piec-

able to learn and polish them in just six

mind quite frequently!”

One of the choir’s most popular events
is the Holiday Concert it puts on every
year, drawing more than 2,000 people to
the chapel each December. The concert
is broadcast live over WQED-FM to lis-
teners not only in Allegheny County, but
around the globe.

choir’s decision to begin touringA,inter—

wherever we went, we

ing our University,” said
Rachel Labosky, Pitt se-

member. “We bring a
strong sense of tradi-

then on, the choir be- .

came an official “concert” choir, increas-
ing its members from about 25 to the cur-
rent number of about 50. _.

The choir is led by longtime directo
john Goldsmith, who-was brought in to
help restore the choir’s quality in 1989
after years of neglect by various grad stu-
dent directors who were too busy to de-
vote the necessary time and attention to
the choir. '

“The [choir] provides Pitt students an
opportunity to sing in-an a cappella choir
of very high quality, and our greatly var-
ied repertoire attracts capacity audiences
who appreciate hearing fabulous music in
the glorious acoustics of Heinz Chapel,”
Goldsmith said.

After directing a high school choir and
two professional choirs and then becom-
ing a member of the famous Chanticleer

vocal ensemble, Goldsmith was asked to ,

direct the Heinz Chapel Choir and has
been here for the last 23 years. Under

his steady tutelage and stringent atten- -

tion to his singers’ ability to stay in tune,
the Heinz Chapel Choir became the re-
nowned and notable ﬁxture on Pitt’s cam-
pus that it is today.

To keep the concert program fresh,

tion to the campus, and
we carry that tradition
wherever we go.”

While some groups and clubs at the
University have come and gone, the
Heinz Chapel Choir has-remained stead-
fast. The choir’s popularity can be attrib-
uted to the beauty of the songs included
in the group’s repertoire -and the quality
of the singers themselves. They share a
sense that participating in the choir isn’t
simply “just singing” but somuch more.

“Making music together bound us to
one another in an enduring way,” said
Kristenlsukalac, a member of the choir
from 1989-1994. “The emotional bond
to the choir’s traditions, to the chapel, to
the other members, to the director you
serve under, to thememories associated
with the songs and to Pitt in general is
strong and withstands time.”

The choir also serves as a release for
a lot of the singers. It’s an escape from
the stress and monotony of textbooks,
homework assignments and exams.

“The Heinz Chapel Choir is an oasis
for the singers,” Goldsmith said. “They
can leave their academic worries at the
rehearsal door for four hours every week
to immerse themselves in beautiful mu-
sic.” . 1

Bowman realized the need to involve the
adult community, as well, and in 1926, he pro-
posed that any nationality with a signiﬁcant
number of people in Pittsburgh be allowed to
design a nationality room for the Cathedral.
He appointed a young sociology professor,
Ruth Mitchell, to direct the program.

Pittsburghers were thrilled. They raised
money through bake sales, church events and
gifts from foreign governments. The Federal
Baking Co. created an edible model of the
building; a local grocer used milk cans, coffee
and sugar to depict the rising building.

Maxine Bruhns, director of the Nationality
Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs,
said the rooms were celebrated and beloved
by the communities.

“The Yugoslav room did a Kennywood
Park fundraiser every summer for 16 years,”
Bruhns said. “The Russian committee would
have tea ceremonies. The French earned their
money by offering a transatlantic trip as a
prize. The Greeks raised it mainly through
food fairs.”

Digging through the night

After two years of painstaking arguments
over the design and ﬁnancial issues, plans
for construction ﬁnally began on Sept. 27,
1926, on land bought with aid from the Mel-
lon family —- coveted land which held a few
dilapidated buildings scattered tl1roughout14
acres of uncluttered ﬁelds. To prevent any ﬂir-
ther opposition, construction began quietly.

The local community initially was dis-

pleased by the plans, despite the numerous‘

awards Klauder had won for his fusion of
the modern skyscraper and Gothic ideals.
Trustees complained of the extreme height,
worrying of potential danger due to the inter-
national ridicule and the possibility of running
out of funds. —

“[It’s] the world’s largest keep—off-the-
grass sign,” the famous architect Frank Lloyd
Wright said.

Bowman was undaunted; he relented to a
design of 42 stories.

Many alumni refused to donate out of spite
—- Bowman had been too busy to meet with
them earlier in his term. Others ordered their
donations be used for anything but the build-
ing’s construction.

A.J. Kelly Jr., the man who had recruited
Bowman,'visited his residence, demanding
Bowman stop work immediately. Kelly sug-
gested populating the area with numerous
small constructions.

Bowman argued vehemently, and he or- 6
dered the contractors to work around the

clock. .

The manager of the nearby Schenley Hotel
— now the William Pitt Union — complained.
The noise was disturbing his guests. Construc-
tion was limited to 16 hours a day.

The Cathedral posed “quite an interest-
ing engineering and construction problem,”
according to Frederick Crabtree, the ﬁeld en-
gineer. A strong foundation bed was required
to hold the building’s weight, as well as force
clue to the strong Pittsburgh winds.

In October 1929, three years after the
ground was broken, an American ﬂag was
placed atop the ﬁnished steel skeleton. The
building was 525 feet tall.

Three days later, the New York Stock Ex-
change crashed.

Hard times

Yet work continued. On Feb. 28, 1931, the
Cathedral held its ﬁrst classes in unplastered

' rooms.

Barely a month later, all construction
ceased. The ﬁnancial well had run dry. Bow-
man was -exhausted ~— he’d ignored his physi-
cian’s insistent orders for rest and relaxation.

The Cathedral stood unﬁnished. Stone-
work had been partially placed on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor, but from the street, it appeared as if
Bowman had begun construction on the ﬁfth
ﬂoor. Rumors circulated that Bowman had
designed the methodology so disgruntled

Ranking the top athletic icons in Pitt sports history

Dave Uhrmacher
Stczﬁ” Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s athletic programs
have been graced by numerous stand-out stu-
dent athletes and coaches over the years.

Each era has boasted its share of stars both
on the ﬁeld and on the sidelines who have lit up
collegiate athletics, butaselect few stand outas
sporting icons that hail from Pitt.

These ﬁgures not only had an effect on
their respective sports, but also inﬂuenced and
united the University as a whole, bringing the
national spotlight to Pitt numerous times as a
direct result of their superior performances
and achievements.

As selected by members of The Pitt News’
sports staff, here are the top 10 ﬁgures that have
earned legendary status inthe 17varsity sports
and 125 years of Pitt athletics:

10. Brandin Knight (men’s basketball,
point guard, 1999-2003; assistant coach,
2008-present) '

Big East Co—player ofthe Year and third team
All-American in 2002, Knight was the driving
force behind the success of the Pitt basketball
team early in the decade.

When he graduated, Knight held school
records for career assists, assists per game,
steals, assists in a season and minutes played
in a season.

The deﬁning moment of the point guard’s
career was in 2003, when he played through

the game. “We ﬁnally got over the hump, over-

His jersey number, 20, was retired by Pitt
basketball in 2009, and he remains avital part
of the basketball programas anassistantto head
coachjamie Dixon.

9. Shavonte Zellous (women’s basketball,

shooting guard, 2005-2009)

The only Pitt women’s basketball player ever
to have been drafted in the WNBA, Zellous fol-
lowed up her record—setting career with the
Panthers by cementing herselfas a solid profes-
sional player. She still plays signiﬁcant minutes
with the Indiana Fever.

During Zellous’ four years at Pitt, the Pan-
thers’ women’s basketball program experienced
unprecedented success, qualifyingfor the NCAA
Tournament three times and advancing to the
Sweet Sixteen for the ﬁrst two times in school
history.

Despite being lightly recruited out of high
school, Zellous ended up at Pitt after head coach
Agnus Berenato noticed her raw talent.

“Nobody was after Shavonte,” Berenato told
ESPN in 2008. “But we were horrendous my
ﬁrst year here — we had six wins. So we were
looking for anything.”

Zellous ﬁnished third on Pitt’s all—time scor-
ing list, racking up 2,253 career points and earn-
ing Third Team All-American status after her
senior year.

Pitt band director stepsdown, dynasty ensured for future

Anna Weldon
Impulse Editor

Jack R. Anderson’s ﬁrst steps onto a
Pitt home ﬁeld took place before he
could even physically pick up a drum.

“I’ve been here since I was 3 years
old,” Anderson said.

Anderson, 64, works as Pitt’s
band director — a leader in recreat-
ing Pitt’s on—ﬁe1d musical traditions
and entertaining fans who religiously
attend each season’s games. Ander-
son has greatly impacted many band
members and Pitt students through-
out his career. But after 18 years as
ﬁill-time band director and 27 years
total of dedication withhis part-time
assistant position included, Ander-
son has chosen to leave his respected

‘position, marching into retirement.

Turning 65 in November, Ander-
son has a gray head of hair and kind
eyes that squint to his hairline when
he smiles. While working in his office
before a Friday practice in September,
he donned a Pit hat and matching
Pitt Windbreaker — a signature look
that preserved a sense of his devo-
tion to his post even off the ﬁeld. In
his large office located in the Trees
Hall band room, he has pictures lin-
ing the walls and armoires ﬁlled with
awards and gifts from past students.

He touched the photographs gently as
he admired them, fondly looking at
family members and musicians from
the band. After such a long afﬁliation
with the Pitt band, Anderson looked
at home in the band room amongthe
instruments and uniforms that the

band uses at practice and on the ﬁeld. ,

Growing up with Pitt

His father and namesake, Jack
Anderson, worked as Pitt’s assistant
band director from 1948 to 1970.
Because of his father’s involvement,
Anderson developed a huge respect
and affection for the Pitt band and its
role in the University. As a fan of the
band’s music and traditions, ayoung
Anderson would frequently march
along the ﬁeld to the band’s music

_ and choreography.

“So, basically, I grew up on the
sidelines of Pitt football,” he said.

The Pitt band was assembled for
the ﬁrst time on Oct. 14, 1911, on
Forbes Field at the Pitt versus Ohio

Northern game, and it has played at‘

football games since then under mul-

tiple band directors. The Pitt students V

in the band spend each night of the
week preparing andpracticing for
their pregame, halftime and garne-
time performances at the games.

drum major — a coveted role in the
band that demonstrates his student
leadership and musical capability ——
knows of Anderson’s long affiliation
with the band. . '
“It’s not the Pitt band, it’s thejack
R. Anderson band,” Bowers said.
For Bowers, the Pitt band and An-
derson go hand-in—hand, and, with
the band director’s we1l—known his—_
tory, Bowers sees the organization
intertwined with Anderson’s life.
“This is What he grew up withj’
Bowers said, referring to how An-
derson’s entire childhoodwas rooted
in the band from the amount of time
he spent on the sidelines with his fa-
ther. When he was in fourth grade,
Anderson would even perform the
choreography for each weel<’s half-
time show in front ofhis class. He had
a miniature uniform he would wear
to feel like one of the band, and after
spending so much time at practices,

Anderson learned the marches by
heart. ” I

I “I’m a band geek,” he joked.
Anderson attended Pitt as an un-

dergraduate, and while he studied
music at Pitt, he played the drums in
the marching band. Like" current band
students, Anderson felt the rush of
excitement from the fans each time
he entered onto the ﬁeld.

band along with his father, also

director. Courtesy Jack R. Anderson

“It’s something you never forget,”

he said.

He graduated withadegree in mu-
sic in 1970 — the same year as his
father’s retirement — but he didn’t
realize the management baton would
one day be passed to him, though he
did dream of one day holding the
position.

In 1969, a year before his gradu-
ation, Anderson met his wife Peggy,
aﬂute and piccolo player in the band‘

 

who studied English. In 1970, the two
graduated together, and in1971, they
were married.

From ﬁeld to household

Once he left Pitt, Anderson con-
tinued on to Edinboro University to
receive his master’s degree. In 1972,
he graduated with his master’s in mu-
sic and a certiﬁcation in education so
he could return to Pitt to teach.

Just because Anderson left the
University to further his education
doesn’t mean he left the Pitt band.
During his time at Edinboro, Ander-
son did not miss abeat of the group’s
action as he continued to participate
as the band’s percussion director after
his graduation until 1974 —— a very
important year in Anderson’s life. ’

In the fall of 1974, his wife Peggy
became pregnant with their ﬁrst
child. At the time, the two lived in
Greenville, Pa. That Thanksgiving,
Pitt played Penn State at Three Riv-
ers Stadium, but the in-state rivalry
wasn’t the only thing that made the
couple nervous.

Peggy was soon due with the
couple’s child and was fearful that if
Anderson left forthe game, she would
go into labor. Luckily, their ﬁrstbom
would wait.

coaches across the country, and his Panthers
will seek their fourth consecutive Eastern Wres-
tling League title this season.

The ﬁve-time EWL Coach of the Year has
coached more than 20 All—Arnericans and three
national champions in his long tenure.

“It’s a great honor being named in the top
10,” Stottlemyer said. “It just goes to show you
what hard work can do. I had a great wrestling
career here and followed it up with a very ful-
ﬁlling coaching career. I’m happy to have been

helped to create this great program.”

As a wrestler at Pitt, Stottlemyer compiled
a 68—16—2 record and was a three-time All-
American.

7. Roger Kingdom (track and ﬁeld, 1981-
1984) « ‘ —

Originally attending Pitt to play on afootball

scholarship, Kingdom excelled on the track, not .

the football ﬁeld. .

After winning NCAA championships in the
110 —meter hurdles and 55—meter hurdles, King-
dom represented the United States at the 1984
Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

He won a gold medal in the 110—meter
hurdles with a then-Olympic record time of
13.2 seconds. He also won gold in the same

South Korea.
But his incredible careeras a sprinter never

. might have happened if the Pitt football coaches

hadn’t planned on makingKingdom afree safety
instead of a ball carrier.

“I would have liked to have stayed at run-
ning back,”Kingdom said to Sports Illustrated
in1988. _

6. Larry Fitzgerald (football, wide re-
ceiver, 2oo2-2003)

Referred to by New England Patriots coach
Bill Belichick as “one of the all-time greats, may-
be the best ever,” Fitzgerald is the epitome of a
professional athlete —— today with the Arizona
Cardinals in the NFL.

His play on the ﬁeld and superb effort off it

distinguishes him as one of the premier players
to ever compete for Pitt.

He rewrote the record books in his two years
as a Panther,,catching an incredible 34 touch-
downs in just26 games and tallying2,677 yards.
He still holds an NCAA record for pulling in a

V touchdown.pass in 18 straight games.

And Fitzgerald has been just as good in his
professional career, making six Pro Bowls and
almost leading the Cardinals to a victory over
the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII.

5. Henry Clifford “Doc” Carlson (three- 2'

sport athlete, 1915-1917; men’s basketball
head coach, 1922-1953)

After playing football, basketball and base-
ball at Pitt, Carlson took over the basketball
program in 1922 and held the position for more
than three decades, earning 367 career wins. _

During that span, Carlson’s Panthers won
two national championships —— in 1928 and
1930 — and reached the modern NCAA Tour-
nament’s Final Four for the only time in school
history in 1941.

Since his death in 1964, Carlson’s legacy
lives on with his “Figure 8” offense, which many
other coaches in college basketball began utiliz-
ing at the time. ’ ‘ ‘

4. Hugh Green (football, defensive end,
1977-1980)

_ Green dominated during his time at Pitt as
one of the most productive defensive players in

' college football history.

He ﬁnished his four-year career with 460 "
tackles and 53 sacks, and he narrowly missed
the rare feat of winning the Heisman Trophy
— an award given armually to the best player
in college football — as a defender, ﬁnishing
second in 1980.. «

Former Southern California head coachjohn
McKay believed Green was one of the best de-
fensive ends ever to play college football.

“Hugh Green is the most producﬁve player at
his position I have ever seen in college,” McKay
said.

Despite‘ an injury-plagued pro career with
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Miami Dol-
phins, Green was inducted to the College Foot-

. ball Hall of Fame, and his jersey number, 99, will

never be worn by another Pitt football player.

An open letter to’ Chancellorjohn Bowman
Alex “Aloysius” Zimmerman, student '
Dear Chancellor Bowman,

As you are aware, our University has
erupted in controversy over your mis-
guided plan to erect an academic cathe—

dral. I feel compelled to speak on behalf ‘

of my fellow students, for we have grave
concerns about your commitment to con-

structing an elitist limestone Gothic mon- _

strosity that so obviously jeopardizes the
mission of this ﬁne University. '

Not only will this “cathedral” buckle un-
der the weight of its own’ self-importance,
it is quite physically unsound. We implore
you to heed the warnings of our beloved
former chancellor, William Holland,
whose expertise in the difference between
stable earth and quicksand is unparalleled.
In the words of Chancellor Holland: “Oh!
Ho! I feel forced to tell what I know about

the ground chosen for this building. I am ’

speaking as a geologist. Under the surface
where it is proposed to put up this struc-
ture there is a deep bed of quicksand. ‘It is
lucky the quicksand is there. This whole
plan is nonsense.” It is peculiar that you in-

sist on ignoring the dire warnings of Chan- '

cellor Holland’s sand-pit theory, given that
your head is clearly buried in it.

What’s more, such a tall structure will
undoubtedly sway violently in the wind,
since there are no other close buildings
of equal height that could shield the mas-
sive structure. We fear that in particularly

ﬁerce windstorms, students, being stu-

dents, will have little time to escape its
violent oscillations before being thrown to
their deaths. Though these fatalities will
be a welcome reprieve from dimly lit study
sessions in your “common room,”‘which
seems to have a suspicious penitentiary
motif, we worry that the resulting psycho-
logical trauma will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
freshman retention rates. Further, the in-
evitable ﬁeld of debris that will result from
the tower’s collapse will endanger our
pristine pastoral landscape.

Susceptibility to wind isn’t the only
structural ﬂaw in your cathedral design.
You claim that students will efficiently

glide from ﬂoor to ﬂoor in modern eleva- ’

tors — balderdash! Everyone knows that
robust elevator technology is more than a
century away. Yourlpretentious tower will
have us stuck between ﬂoors for hours on
end. Students will be forced to ride the el-
evators one by one for fear that they will
be trapped in a brutish, Hobbesian state of
nature’ with their professors.

You claim that the cathedral will “sing
of courage and bring delight.” This could
not be further from the truth. Instead, it
will attract an unsavory combination of
tourists, polo—wearing tour guides, disori-
ented migratory birds and the inebriated.
Even just one of these creatures would dis-
rupt -the quotidian rhythms of university
life.

If completed, we know the adminis-
trative powers that be will be unable to

resist plastering the image of the cathe— I

dral on everything and overburden our
postal system with promotional material.

The campus will revolt in a ﬁt of jealousy -

when students come to realize you love the

cathedral more than you love us. We just
want to be loved as much as an inanimate
building — is that too much to ask?

Your half-brained attempt to fund and

construct the cathedral will likely leave it

incomplete. You _have proposed recruiting

‘children to help build the cathedral brick

by brick. There are several reasons chil-
dren make bad cathedral builders. First
of all, they are prone to distraction. It’s
impossible to get children to line up in an
orderly fashion, never mind construct a
535—foot skyscraper. Second, children cry
when you make them do manual labor out-

side for 16 hours at atime. Crying children
are bad. Also, children aren’t good at pick-
ing up heavy objects.

When all we’re left with-is a swaying,
half—built, unfunded, unventilated cathe—
dral to nowhere, your legacy as our 10th
chancellor will be forever tarnished. The
Board of Trustees will treat you with con-
tempt, and President Harding will call for
your resignation. Please, Chancellor Bow-
man, webeg of you: Don’t build this cathe-
dral. I '

I’m sick of waiting for all of you. The situ-
ation on this campus is deteriorating. It’s
getting out of hand. Last week, I’had to
wait an hour in the computer lab.

Yes, an hour, just to use the 3-D print-
ers. I couldn’t believe it. It’s 2037, and

_all our advanced technology still hasn’t

discovered a more efficient way to print.
Even with the advent of Google Goggles
and wireless electricity and 3-D monitors
and inkless printers, there was still a line
out the door at noon when my column for
Pitt’s 250th Anniversary Edition was due
at 12:30. I

As I waited, I tried to guess ‘how long

I’d be there. I spied a student playing
3-D Tetris in the corner of the lab, and
another student telling her computer to
organizeeher digital planner. In fact, as

I looked around the lab, I saw very few.
. students typingor speaking any work

or printing anything at all. C’mon guys,

I had stuff to do. My wait would take me if

past the deadline. _

I took out my phone to call my mom
to try and eat up some time. She gradu-
ated from Pitt 25 years ago, so I thought
she’d understand my annoyance with
these tech-addicted drones. I stood in
line listening to her phone ring, when
an idiot kid on a hoverboard swooped
into line trying to get ahead and almost
knocked me over. I dropped my phone,

though lucky for him, the new anti—drop
technology on the iPhone72 let it bounce
right back into my hands. _

Finally, my mom answered, and as I
told her I was waiting in line at a print-
ing lab, she was empathetic. “We had
the same problem when I went to school
there, and they had the same problem
years before that. No matter how ad-
vanced we become, the printing lab will
be crowded.” Smart words from my mom,
but I still wanted to bite someone’s head
off. Something needs to be done.

So, unruly youth, I demand you stop
wasting my time. Follow these rules and
get out of my way.

1. Get your work done early — I know
there are many things to be ‘distracted

by, from 3-D television to the holograms
walking down the street to robots per-
forming on the street for some spare
change after being outdated for factory
work. But get your act together, put down
your iPod and ﬁght procrastination, and
you’ll have a lot more time to get to the
computer lab and 3-D print your work
before class. .
2. Avoid peak times — Most classes on
campus fit into certain time slots during
the week. A second of logical thinking
tells you that the minutes before an hour
mark during the day are going to be the
busiest times, as students are rushing to

For years, international ‘students have found a home at Pitt

Daniel Okwaisie
Colum7zz's2.‘

Editor’s Note: Since shortly after WWI,

Pitt has served as the academic home of
countless international students. Start-
ing in the late 1940s, Pitt’s Oﬁice of In-
ternational Services has offered help to
students making this drastic transition.
One of these students is columnist Daniel
Okwaisie, who recounts some of his feel-
ings and experiences since arriving from
Ghana.

My own ﬁrst brush with this brute
reality came after I had interacted with
Richie for_ about 10 minutes. As I walked
up to him, his blank stare and teary
eyes made it seem he was looking right
through me. I got closer and asked,
“What’s wrong?” Richie, an international
student from China, holding back a few
tears, said, “I am so far away from my
home. Yes, I can talk to my family, but I
am not there with them. What if some-
thing happens‘? I can’t do anything about
it.” .

For foreign students such us Richie
and me, the day comes swiftly when our
parents and loved ones escort us to the
airport with brave faces and full knowl-
edge of impending goodbyes. We share a
few hugs, some tears roll down, and then
we step on board a plane to venture into
uhfamiliar territory. While some get the
luxury of having parents on board, this

‘or a college team

only delays the eventual harshhgoodbye

until it is bestowed right-in front of our

dorm rooms.’

In those few hours of ﬂiglit; you make
a big transition from one life to another.
Life seems so foreign. You try not to be
out of place, but some things are sim-
ply too jarring

contemplating. You must adapt as fast as

possible, so it doesn’t become a dragon
‘ your academic priorities.
But it is in this acclimatization pro— ~

cess that you-realize the greatness of the
University of Pittsburgh. You also realize
that learning is fundamentally rooted in

diversity: in the di-

fully. You stumble
through, in ret-
rospect, awkward
questions about
whether the Steel-
ers are a pro team

—— a, ’ few people
give-clueless looks
that make you feel
bad. But others are

ing your questions
to become friends.

alize that you are
indeed in a country
of opportunity, and
that, regardless of
'your- background,
you will encounter

one that cannot_be
simulated —— it is
only possible_when you are in a different
culture. _ «
All freshmen enter university con-
templating what lies ahead of them aca-
demically and socially, but most of this
thinking is done within a frameworhhof
cultural familiarity. As a freshman "inter-
national student, you don’t have this lux-

‘ ury; you don’t even know where to start

never-ending op-

portunities to grow
beyond whatever humble roots you may
have at a school such as Pitt. You even
learn to laugh at your initial naivete and
culture shock: I can’t forget walking
around aimlessly my freshman year try-
ing to get used to my new environment,
when the most gorgeous girl sauntered
by a few feet away from me. I looked up
to the skies and said, “thank you.”

Outside the classroom, the unity, spir-
it and affection of the Pitt community
settle you right in. As a foreign student,
it doesn’t take you long to begin incorpo-
rating strong, feelings for the University,
because in the Pitt community, there is
this deep feeling of togetherness — so
strong that even when bomb threats"dis—
rupt the community, Facebook abounds
with chants of solidarity.

These days, I still see Richie, albeit
sparingly, riding on his bike to and from
classes with a smile on his face. He and
I, like many otherinternational students,
still realize we are far from home and
that Thanksgiving or spring break might
mean staying in the dorm by ourselves.
We often do miss our families, but Skype

helps us keep in touch with them. How- ’

ever, we stroll across campus every day
‘knowing we have a new family —— the ‘Pitt
community.’ ,_ .

The strangest part is ‘that there is no
one in particular to thank for this: per-
haps I should just walk down Forbes
Avenue and randomly shake hands —
everyone makes this community work.
As international students, we help con-
tribute tothis University’s diversity and
global excellence in learning. And Pitt,
with 225 years of excellence’, _takes.us

from a long time ago, says my mom) still
hasn’t come true, ‘we can’t turn back

time. It’s much better to get to the lab I

early in the morning or later in the eve-
ning when fewer classes are happening
so that you’re not late. Because once you
get in the printing lab line, then,, you
can’t go back.

3. Keep the fun to a minimum — It’s

simple. Since the University started re-
quiring students to come prepared with
quantum laptops, we all have comput-
ers at home. Much nicer ones than in the
computer labs. So skip playing games,
organizing your schedule, sending vocal
email or whatever it is you do in the com-
puter lab and instead just sit, print, leave
and make way for those of us who have
real work to do.

4. Back up your work — Just in case
you get to the lab and realize that you
neversent the email to yourself contain-

ing your paper, backing up your work
will save you valuable time searching for
it. It’s simple. Put your work in the cloud.
Keep it organized, start a folder just for
work that needs to be printed and save
your work to the cloud. Then you can just
choose what you need hassle—free, and
let it rain down into the printer.

5. The main thing is courtesy j—— If-

you’re in the computer lab and you see
a line starting, be aware and mindful of
what you’re spending your time doing.
If there’s no line, by all means do what-

ever you want. But if hoverboarders start

swooping in and forming a line, be kind
and save whatever you’re doing for later.
Just a simple awareness and courtesy to-
ward other studentswill help keep the
printing labs more orderly.

Not to mention, if you focus on your

work, maybe you can be the one to in-'

vent an advanced, yet easy, way to print
quickly and efficiently. Then, possibly by
Pitt’s 275th Anniversary, the printing lab
problem will be gone. I I

Way past ‘Go’: The marathon lMonopoly game

In 1961, Parker: Brothers ms/om’ $1 million in play money to Pitt on om amnored tmc/eforgame to continue

Joe Chilson
Staff I/Vriter

Monopoly’s game board is a street—by—
street replica of Atlantic City, NJ. But
the game’s most historic moment may
have occurred right here in Pittsburgh.

On Monday, Nov. 27, 1961, four Pitt
students sat down to play a game ofMo—
nopoly. By the time they stopped, they
had made a mark on the history of the
iconic game that stands to this day.

The record for the longest Monopoly
marathon ever played was set here at

Pitt in 1961, when brothers from the‘

Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity played for
five days straight.

The original players were Sigma Al-
pha Mu brothers Eddie Leeds, Howard
Finkel, Allen Paulenoff and Sherman Fo-
gel. As they played, the brothers pooled
their resources and split into teams —
Leeds and Finkel versus Paulenoff and
Fogel. But with the players working to-
gether, it became much harder to knock
anyone out of the game.

“Somebody had a Monopoly game,
and we started to play this thing. And
sooner or later, we realized that we
couldn’t end it,” said Eddie Leeds, who

According to Leeds, the game
dragged on for hours into Monday
night. When it still hadn’t ended by
Tuesday morning, the brothers all de-
cided that they couldn’t just stop. They
wanted to let people know that they
weren’t going to. So Leeds called KDKA
Pittsburgh’s local news affiliate and
told them, “Hey, we’re in the middle of
a Monopoly game that we can’t end, and
we’re going to keep this thing going.”
Leeds told KDKA that they could
send someone down to the fraternity
house on Dithridge Street if they want-
ed to see the game for themselves. At
3 a.m. on Tuesday morning, a KDKA
representative found the brothers still
hard at play and decided to pick up’ the
story. _
By the time dawn rolled around on
Tuesday, the four brothers needed to
think up a way to keep their game go-
ing and still attend to their other com-
mitments — like class. They started
playing-in shifts, with other fraternity
brothers and pledges playing for the

ANDERSON  

- Anderson attended the iconic game to playin
the band, and Peggy didn’t go into labor. On Dec.
7, 1974, baby Carriewasborn, and Anderson knew
he had to cut something from his life.

“Once that happened, Ihad to give something
up, so I quit the Pitt band,” he said.

Katie, the Andersons’ second daughter, was
born in 1977. The girls attended Pitt for their un-
dergraduate studies and participated in the band.
Carriewas aﬂutist and piccoloistinthe marching
band andan oboistinthe concertband; Katiewas
a baritone homist in the marching band.
Composing a career

Anderson began working at Keystone Oaks
School District in the South Hills in 1977, ﬁrst as
a band director and later as a music teacher. In
order to teach music, educators must be able to
play and teach every instrument, Anderson ex-
plained. From kindergarten songs to the violin,
Anderson had to have at leastan understanding of
every instrument, even ifhe couldn’tbe an expert.

\ Duringhis time as amusic teacher; Anderson
began working part—time as an assistant band
director at Pitt in 1986, and in 1995, he left. his
position at Keystone and begantoworkfu]l—time
as Pitt’s band director, the same position he holds
today.

Stephen Kendro, a radio chemistry supervi-
sor in a lab at UPMC, was the ﬁrst drum major
underAndersonin1995. Kendro, who majoredin
chemistry, said Andersonwas part of the reason
he stayed in the band after his freshman year.

“When [Anderson] took over, there was a

better retention of students, there was better
recruiting, and we were playing better music,”
Kendro said.

One of his favorite moments as dI‘LlI‘I1 major
was during a Halloween-themed halftime show.
The band performed a choreographed produc-
tionto songs includingthe “Ghostbusters’ ’ theme
and Michael]acl<son’s “Thriller.” Students dressed
up in Halloween costumes, and the band turned
the old Pitt football stadium’s ﬁeld into the stage
of a frightening musical production.

“It wouldn’t be college football without the
band,” Kendro said.

Kendro explained that in 1995, there was a
complete change m the athletic department at
Pitt. Because itwas the same yearAnderson took
over as band director, he had more free reign to
make changes. And with Kendro as drum major,
the two focused closely on teamwork, commit-
ment and pride — all of which they centered on
a foundation of discipline.

And through Anderson’s leadership, the band
has grown considerably. Some students in the
Pitt band have a high enough level of talent to
study music at a more musically focused school,
Anderson explained, but because they came to
Pitt to study academic—based specialties, the
band’s talent has increased signiﬁcantly. Bow-
ers, for example, has excelled as drum major but

* continues to stay dedicated  his demanding

pharmacy major. *
'“We’ve grown in numbers and we’ve grown
in quality,” Anderson said.

Tyler McGaughey, the band’s drum major
from2007to2009, oftenreurrnsto help withthe
band’s practices. McGaughey graduated in201o,
and like Anderson, he has noticed a signiﬁcant

change in the talent of the students.

“The type of students are higher quality,” Mc-
Gaughey said, commenting on the all—around
performances of new recruits.

Spreading spirit through the crowd

Even with developments in marching band,
Anderson continues toview the program’s main
goal as a simple one: “We’re there to entertain,”
Anderson said.

And to do that, the Pitt band needs help from
alumni. McGaughey explained thatall of the staff
work as volunteers, except for the directors.

“We’re the guys that go ﬁnd the problems and
go out and ﬁx them,” he said.

The home game process proves lengthy for
fans, and the band strives to provide entertain-
ment each step of the way. The Pitt band begins
playing two hours before the game when it
welcomes the football team to the ﬁeld. Then it
moves to the amphitheater for a pregame show
and, afterward, it moves to the student tailgate
atjerome Bettis Grille 36, the parade and, ﬁnally,
the on-ﬁeld pregame show.

“We are part of the pageantiy of college foot-
ball,” he said.

Stepping down from the ladder

Despite the passion Anderson has for col-
lege football and the marching band he led for
decades, he knows that it’s time forhimto retire.
Anderson has attended more than 50 years of
band camps since his original affiliation with

° the organization, a challenging job for anyone

because of the amount of physical activity that
comes with learning the music, ﬁeld formations
and choreographyfans getto see at home games.
“I don’t feel old emotionally, but there’s a lot
of wear and tear on this body,” Anderson said.

‘f   s tiiiiriii’

That doesn’t mean the band wasn’t surprised
at the announcement of his departure.

Bowers explained that the night that Ander-
son decided to tell the entire band he would retire
at the end of the season was a tough one. As he
stated his decision, many ﬁfth—year members
wiped their eyes, atributetothe connectionthey’d
established with the beloved director.

McGaughey expressed similar shock.

“It’s asurprise. It’s suchaﬁnal thing,” he said.

ButAnderson looks forward to retirement so
he can take time to do things he hasn’t been able
to inthe past. Anderson andhiswife plantotravei
to Europe, or“wherever she wants to go,” he said.

Anderson also has two grandchildren and
one more on the way, and he said they keep him
occupied. Anderson’s grandson Andy turns 5 .in
October, and he already knows the music and cho-
reographyto the band’s songs.]ake,whoturns 2 in
December, has also showed interest intl1e band.

“The two boys already march and know all
the songs. They go to band camp,” Anderson
Said. “They can march pregame on the sideline.
I have to keep them off me ﬁeld so they don’t get
runover.” S A

McGaughey, who has known Anderson since
histime inthe bandthree years ago, doesn’tthink
that this ends the Anderson legacy.

“Hisgrandkidswi]lgotoPittandwillbeinthe
band,” McGaughey said conﬁdently.

AndAnderson feels hopeﬁil that theywill act
on the band gene and receive the same musical

joy that he did in their potential ﬁiture career.

“Not too many people get to realize their
dream job. And since I was a little bo_y, this was
whatlwanted to do, andI got the opportunity to
do it,” he said. “So, why wouldn’t I smile?” I

Memorable sports moments

  

G

 

comprise Pitt’s proud  

Sean Corrado & RJ Sepich
The Pitt News Stqff

Almost every year in Pitt athletics, there’s that
one moment. ‘

It’s that moment when students, alumni and
fans join the athletes in absolute delirium after
a stunning touchdown, catch, shot or victory.

While Pitt hasn’t won any national champi-
onships for many years, there have still been
numerous moments and memories that Pan-
thers fans look back on with fondness.

Here are 10 of the greatest moments in the
recent history of Pitt sports, selected by mem-
bers of The Pitt News’ sports section:

10. Levance Fields’ shot defeats Duke in
overtime (Dec. 20, 2007)

In one of the closest games in Pitt basketball
history, guard Levance Fields stepped back to
hit a game—winning 3—pointer in overtime, as the
No. 9 Panthers downed No. 7 Duke. _

The shot sent the Madison Square Garden
crowd in New York into pandemonium. After
Duke missed two chances to win the game, Pitt
held on for the memorable early season upset,
65-54. '

But just minutes before Fields’ shot, Pitt

senior small forward Mike Cook — one of the

team’s leaders ~— went down with a severe knee
injury that ended his season. Head coachJa-
mie Dixon got choked up after the game when
asked how he was feeling after such an emo-
tional night.

“This is the most bittersweet night of my
coaching career,” Dixon said. i

9. “Pistol Pete” stuns the Mountaineers
in the Backyard Brawl (Nov. 28, 1997)

Late in triple overtime, Pitt quarterback “Pis-
tol Pete” Gonzalez hitjake Hoffart with a deep
pass to convert a fourth-and—17. He then found
Terry Murphy inthe back of the end zone to end
the Panthers’ ﬁve—game losing streak against
their West Virginia rivals. i

In what was at the time the longest college
football game ever played, Pitt shocked the
Mountaineers in Morgantown, 41-38.

After the game, ﬁrst-year Pitt head coach
Walt Harris struggled to contain his excitement.

“I think the Lord was a factor tonight,” he
said. “Finally, we’ve done our part to make this
more of a rivalry.”

8. Dejuan Blair ﬂips Thabeet (Feb. 16,
2009)

Early in a crucial matchup between the No.
4 Panthers and No. 1 Connecticut, Dejuan Blair,
a 6-foot—5 Pitt forward, flipped 7—f0ot—3 UConn
star center Hasheem Thabeet over his back
after grabbing a rebound, making a statement
in a game that Pitt would eventually win, 76-68.

Despite being almost afoot on Thabeet, Blair
demonstrated his strength on the national stage
as he led Pitt to the upset victory by recording
22 points and 23 rebounds.

“That was the most physical game I’ve ever
played in my entire life,” Blair, who now plays
in the NBA with the San Antonio Spurs, said of
his dominating performance.

7. Last game at Pitt Stadium (Nov. 13, 1999)

The Pitt football team’s 1999 season will

‘ always be remembered for one game — the

last game at Pitt Stadium.

teams in their absence.
According to Leeds, different people

would take shifts of about anfhour or an ’

hour and a half, and there were about
30 people who played in the game at
one time or another over the course of
the ﬁve days. -

On Wednesday, the game ran into
trouble. As" anyone who’s even brushed
with Monopoly will be aware, a player
receives $200 every time he or she
passes the space “Go.” The Sigma Alpha
Mu brothers had passed “Go” so many

times by this point that their bank had

run out of money. So naturally, the play-
ers wired Parker Brothers,ithe makers
of Monopoly, to suggest a course of ac-
tion.

As recorded in The_Pitt News story
about the debacle, the coverage of the
gamein the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity

magazine, and the current directions -

to Monopoly itself, Parker Brothers did
not let this stand. Upon receiving the
message of~the marathon gamers’ dis-
tress, Parker Brothers President Robert
Barton wired them back.

“Refuse to let bank-fail. Rushing one
million Monopoly dollars to you by air-
mail — carry on.” _ ‘

According to The Pitt News story

from 1961, the brothers loaned back,

some of their Monopoly money to the
bank so they could continue playing
while the reserve funds were being
ﬂown to Pittsburgh International Air-
port. » '

The $1 million in Monopoly money
was picked up at the airport by Brink’s
Security armored trucks and driven to
the fraternity house, arriving on Thurs-
day night, by which time the brothers
had broken the bank again.

‘ At this point, the story was picked up
by major news outlets across the coun-
try, including The Wall Street Journal.
According to Leeds, thejournal thought
the game was an excellent representa-
tion of inﬂation. _

dents watch the game and see how the
value of money can be deflated when
too much ofit is in circulation.”

“That’s how a story went.viral in
those days,” Leeds said.

The game went on for two more
days, but with ﬁnals fast approaching,
the brothers knew it would have to end
sometime. According to the Sigma Al-
pha Mu magazine, they decided toend
it on Saturday, Dec. 2 at'the fraternity’s
Founders Day Dinner.

“You get pretty crazy after playing

Copies of University charters on display in Hillman Library

Mahita Gajanan
Staff Wrz'ter’

Last December, Assistant University Librar-
ian Michael Dabrishus drove to Harrisburg
on a special mission. His job was to pick up
the documents representing the foundation
of Pitt’s existence as a University. When he

2 2 arrived at the state capital, officials present-

ed him two 200-year-old documents — one
in acid-neutral ﬁle folders and another lay-
ing ﬂat in an archival box.

These documents were two original
Pemisylvania charters —— the documents
that established Pitt as the University origi-
nally known as the Pittsburgh Academy.
Though the original charters were retumed
to the state capital this past May, copies of
both documents are currently displayed on
the ground ﬂoor of Hillman Library.

Three display cases in Hillman exhibit a

 timeline of Pitt’s commemoration of the Uni-

versity’s 225th anniversary. The cases, lined
with scenic backdrops containing pictures of
Pittsburgh and other areas of Pennsylvania,
hold short biographies of Chancellors Hugh
Henry Brackenridge, Robert Bruce, Samuel
Black McCormick and other inﬂuential lead-
ers who established Pitt as a university. -

As part of the timeline, copies of the char-
ters, which were tom and tattered upon ar-
rival but since mended by the University Li-
brary System’s Department of Preservation,

are on display through Homecoming Week-
-_, _

end.

According to Dabrishus, the ﬁrst charter,
drafted on Feb. 28, 1787, only ten weeks be-
fore the Constitutional Convention in Phila-
delphia, officiated The Pittsburgh Academy.
Both The Pittsburgh Academy charter and
the U.S. Constitution were written in the

1 same year, in Philadelphia.

“What the [ﬁrst] charter did was essen-
tially incorporate the institution, because all
corporations until well into the 19th century

.had to have a legislative act,” said Van Beck

Hall, a professor of American history at Pitt.
The Pittsburgh Academy began in a small
log cabin on the western frontier. Today, a
log cabin rests adjacent to the Cathedral of
Learning as a landmark that symbolizes the
University’s origins. Z I

The second document, drafted on Feb.
18, 1819, re—chartered ' the school as the
Western University of Pennsylvania, after
the Pittsburgh Academy grew and required
more advanced education.

“The later document changed the name
to the Western University of Pennsylvania,”
Dabrishus said. “In addition, each document
points to and identiﬁes people and/or fea-
tures that the respective institution needed
to havein ‘order to embark on its mission.”

The two written documents deﬁne the
University’s rights and privileges, and de-
scribe the institution’s functions.

tion of youth in useful arts, sciences and lit-

tion 2 of the ﬁrst Charter.

The original charters were put on display
in Hillman in February 2012 and were re-
turned to the State Archives in May, accord-
ing to Dabrishus.

“You see, whenever legislation is passed
by the General Assembly and becomes law
— which is what happened with the Pitts-
burgh Academy — those documents are re-
tained by the government,” Dabrishus said.
“It is an official record, owned and kept by
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

Dabrishus feels that the documents offer
a lot to consider when thinking about their
historical signiﬁcance.

After surviving a semester with more than
140 bomb threats, the Pitt community has
shown its strength. But it doesn’t always
take a crisis situation to unite a campus.
With 225 years under its belt, the University
has also produced a few comfortable, unify-
ing traditions it clings to.

Pitt has developed several well-estab-
lished activities and events for students to
participate in during their time at the Uni-
versity. From sports rituals to a welcoming
ceremony for freshman women, the Univer-
sity gives students something, more to take
part in to solidify their sense of belonging
and identity. '

Lantern Night

The 225—year-old Pitt community ‘has.

traditions that date back almost a century.
Take, for instance, Lantern Night —- Pitt’s
oldest known tradition at 92 years old.
Lantern Night began in 1920 as a wel-
coming ceremony for women coming to
the University, in which knowledge and the
light of learning were passed from one gen-
eration to the next. As a gesture welcoming
them to Pitt, the women of the freshman
class were invited_ into the ‘secretary of the
University’s home, wherethey would each

receive a candle to signify the beginning of

their higher—education journey. '
The women then embarked on a proces-

sion across campus —— all in white dresses
with candles in hand —— to the University
Women’s Center, located in the Sarah Heinz

‘House, a building dedicated exclusively
to Women’s activities that was located by

Alumni Hall" during the early part of the

20th century. As more and more women be-_

gan to attend Pitt, the tradition grew in pop-
ularity. The ceremony _eventually moved to
the Cathedral of Learning Commons«Room

and then to_A1umni Hall. In the mid—1940s,

female students even had to earn their way

into the ceremony. In the month leading up —

, to Lantern Night, then held in October, they

would learn facts about the school’s history,

as well as cheers, chants and other ways to

outwardly support Pitt. 1

Currently, Lantern Night is held in Heinz
Chapel on the night before classes begin in
the fallpterm, and the ceremony is open to all
incoming female students.

' Several different types of lanterns have
been used since the tradition’s inception.
Following the original candles, the ﬁrst lan-
terns were Japanese paper lanterns. After
World War II, the paper lanterns were no

longer allowed because of_Iapan’s role in the
war. Metal lanterns took their place, and
variations on the ﬁrst, basic design have‘
been used ever since.

Lack of funding would have ended Lan-
tern Night many years ago if it weren’t for
the ﬁerce dedication of Pitt’s passionate,
committed alumnae.

Though the ceremony has evolved great),
ly over the years, its meaning remains the"
same.

Julia Shepard, a 1990 graduate of the
College of Arts and Sciences and a 2003
graduate of the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, participated in
Lantern Night as a student in 1986, when
it was still held in the Cathedral Commons
Room. '

“I remember having an amazing sense of
awe at the ceremony when I saw the com-

munity and the family that I was becoming .

a part of,” Shepard said. a
Shepard worked for Pitt as the director

‘ of clubs and constituent groups from 199'8

to 2006 — a job that put her in charge of
Lantern Night. She spoke at Lantern Night
the year after she stopped working for the
University. Though she no longer works
for Pitt, she still helps the Alumnae Council
plan and run the event. A

Remembering the Panthers’ worst athletic moments

Donnie Tasser
‘L _ Szfaﬁ" If/rz'z-‘er

Over the years, the University of Pittsburgh
has had its fair share of athletic success. In-
deed, it is one of the more accomplished uni-
versities in the country in regard to college
sports.

(T, But, like most schools, Pitt’s athletic his-
tory is fraught with low points, as well.

In fact, as many jaded Pitt fans will tell you,
the running theme for the last decade or so
could be labeled “disappointment.”

So, as the University celebrates its 225th
birthday, my inner cynic compelled me to cre-
ate a list of the worst moments in Pitt’s long
athletic history.

8. Pitt men’s basketball misses NCAA
Tournament for ﬁrst time in a decade
(2011)

Starting off the list is a disappointment

.;-.fresh in everyone’s mind.

Last season’s Pitt men’s basketball team . I

began the year as the preseason No. 10 team
in the country, but the Panthers didn’t even
come close to living up to that ranking.

Pitt, a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament
just a year before, not only didn’t qualify for
the 2011 tournament, but was also passed

‘ over by the National Invitation Tournament

1 and had to settle for the College Basketball

Invitational — a tournament most Pitt fans
didn’t even know existed.

Oci0berl12, 2012 I The Pitt News I vwvvv.pitir1evve.c0m  

Against such college basketball- power-
houses as Wofford, Princeton and Washing-
ton State, Pitt won the CBI and also avenged
its memorable 2010 loss to Butler in the pro-
cess. ‘ .

7. Recent football head coaching carou-
sel (2010-2011) ' ’

Following a disastrous 2010 campaign,
Pitt football coach and alunmus Dave Warmst-
edt resigned under pressure from the athletic
department. Let the embarrassment com-

mence.

Pitt turned to Miami (Ohio) head coach
Michael Haywood, who was described by
athletic director Steve Pederson as “a man of
integrity and character.” . V

About two weeks later, Haywood was ar-
rested after an alleged domestic dispute and
was subsequently ﬁred by the University.

Then, Todd Graham entered, with his

. “high-octane” offense and talks of character-

building.

After this reputed offensive genius sput-
tered to a 6-6 record in 2011, he asked per-
mission to interview for a position at Arizona
State. When this opportunity was refused to
him, he abruptly resigned, refused to meet
with Pederson or Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg and announced his decision to leave with
a mass text message to his players.

It is still unclear whose character he was
trying to build during his short stay.

6. Pitt loses Big East title after blowing
21-point lead against Cincinnati (Dec. 5,
2009) -

Behind freshman running back Dion Lew-
is, the No. 14 Panthers stunned the No. 5 and
undefeated Cincinnati Bearcats by jumping
out to a 31-10 lead in the ﬁrst half of the 2009
River City Rivalry, a game that would decide

the winner of that year’s Big East charnpion— ‘

ship.
Then, Pitt dramatically blew its chance at a
trip to the Sugar Bowl by allowing big play af-

_ ter big play as Cincinnati tied the gamefin the

fourth quarter. .

. But the worst play of the game camewhen
holder Andrew Janocko ﬁ1mbled a perfect
snap on an extra point after Pitt had retaken
the lead with less than two minutes remain-
1ng. "

Naturally, the Bearcats‘ scored with 33 sec-
onds left, kicked the decisive extra point. and

4.- Death of the Pitt-Penn State rivalry
(2000)

One of the biggest rivalries in college foot-
ball suffered a slow and painful death when
Pitt and Penn State left the ranks of the “Inde—
pendents” for the life of consistent conference
play in the'Big East and Big Ten, respectively.

Although the rivalry managed to stay alive
for a few years, scheduling opportunities be-
came slim, and Penn State would only agree
to the rivalry if it was given a disproportionate
number of home games.

Rumor was that late Nittany Lions head
coach Joe Patemo was mad at Pitt for not
headlining an all-atliletic “Eastern League”
with Penn State, and his pettiness strangled-
the rivalry to the point of near-nonexistence.

The two teams have not played since Pitt’s
12-0 victory in 2000, but fortunately for both
parties, a home—and-home series has been
scheduled for 2016 and 2017.

3‘. Discontinuation of the women’s bas-
ketball program (1927)

Pitt had an opportunity to be one of the
frontrunners of women’s sports well before
Title lX_demanded support of such programs,
but the University let it slip through its ﬁngers.

In the 19205, basketball had become a pop-
ular sport for women who liked to stay active.
But in line with the then-held belief that wom-
en were too fragile to play competitive sports,

Marino was intercepted in the end zone,

‘ and Pitt never came close to scoring again. ,

Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions scored 48 un-
answered points, triggering the rout.

“We killed ourselves,” Pitt head coachJack--

ie Sherrill said after the Panthers committed

13 penalties and had seven turnovers. “We had.

plenty of chances. Plenty. But you don’t win
with seven turnovers. That’s when theloco-

motives start going the wrong way, andewhen,

that happens, you can sure get run over.”

The Panthers have not come close to com- ’

peting for a national championship since.

1. Code Bowman (1937)

In the 1930s, Pitt was a football power-
house behind Hall of Fame head coach Jock
Sutherland, winning ﬁve national champion-
ships in 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936 and 1937.

But then University Chancellor John Bow-
man and athletic director Whitey Hagan

attempted a policy of de—emphasizing the

school’s athletic programs. A
The plan —— nicknamed “Code Bowman”
_—. called for cutting athletic scholarships, dis-

allowing athletic recruiting and putting mas-

sive restrictions on practice times.

Following the 1938 season, Sutherland re-
signed arnid pressure from the administration
and personal dissatisfaction with the direc-
tion of the program. In 1939, Pittstarted the
season 3-0 and attained a No. 1 ranking" be-
fore stumbling to a 5-4' record and ushering in
eight straight losing seasons.

CHARTER   .-

“When the Pittsburgh Academy came
into existence, Pittsburgh was at the west-
ern edge of American civilization,” he said.
“People who lived in Pittsburgh, including
Hugh Henry Brackenridge, who promoted
the Academy, thought that education was
crueial to the development of the region and
society in general.”

Hall pointed out that the charter is impor-
tant because the legislation gave officials the
power to run the school.

“Without it, they couldn’t have done any-
thing,” Hall said. “The charter makes the in-
stitution into a perpetual body.”

According to Hall, some of" the original
provisions in the charter still apply today.
“I remember looking at it several years

ago, and one of the provisions says that the

faculty has control over what they teach,”
Hall said. “I think they’ve honored that pret-
ty well, and the faculty has a good control
over what they develop in programs.”

Hall said that it is important for students
to be aware of the charter, but to regard it as
a necessary stepping stone for the University
instead of as a set of rules. He advised that
students look at the University Bylaws and
Procedures to ﬁnd material that establishes
the rules of the University. 5

“It is an important document,” Hall said.
“It’s not, however, a document that really
states what’s going to happen.” j

pare the Lanterns a few weeks before the

Qeremony. We also have a great group of
people who help to usher, guide, and direct
on Lantern Night itself,” she said.

Shepard particularly enjoys selecting
and listening to the ‘Lantern Night speakers
each year.

W “We’ve had some tremendous speakers
come and give keynote speeches over the

.years. It’s a great task to pick the women
who may have participated in Lantern Night
as students up to so years earlier and won-
derful to hear them share insight with new
students,” she said.

With the exception of Dean Humphrey,
who spoke at Lantern Night in 2005 when
she ﬁrst came to Pitt, the speaker is always
an alumna. .

“Every year, I still get that certain thrill
when I see the lanterns coming across the
lawn from the Cathedral toHeinz chapel for
the ceremony, and it only gets better when
they leave. By that time it’s dark and you can
see the lanterns more clearly,” Shepard said.

Home plate in Posvar Hall

Outside of Lantern Night and other
school—organized traditions, Pitt’s campus
itself offers students opportunities to em-
brace traditions that relate to the larger
city community. Pathﬁnder and Pitt senior
Rosie McKinley’s favorite tradition is step-
ping on home plate in Posvar Hall when she

gives tours and before she takes tests. The
home plate marks the former site of Forbes
Field, a place that Pittsburghers and base-
ball fans of all ages remember quite fondly.

McKinley, the president of the Pitt Path-
ﬁnders, sees home plate as a tradition that
has directly affected her experience at Pitt.

“Home plate is important to me for sev-
eral reasons. I think I ended up as the presi-
dent of Pathﬁnders because I’ve stepped
on it every tour. But aside from that, home
plate is a perfect example of how Pitt in-
teracts both with history and the greater
surrounding area of Pittsburgh,” McKinley
said.

And. for McKinley, the relic of the former
baseball park also acts as a symbol for the
school. » . -. ‘

“We say ‘the city is our campus,’ and
home plate exempliﬁes that. The Pirates
are obviously not a Pitt team — but they’re
a Pittsburgh team. The history of Forbes
Field isn’t even just a Pittsburgh thing, it’s
a national thing. Babe Ruth stood at home
plate when he hit his last three home runs,
and he’s a national symbol,” she said.

At Forbes Field, The Pittsburgh Pirates
defeated the New York Yankees in game
seven of, the 1960 World Series, shocking
the world‘ in one of the most memorable
games in sports history.

McKinley also described some other
ways in which Forbes Field earned histori-
cal signiﬁcance. .

“Of course, that home plate is most re-

membered as the spot where Bill Maze-

roski hit the only walk-off home run to ever ‘ ‘

clinch a World Series victory,” she said. “It
was a true David-and-Goliath tale. No one
expected the Pirates to win. But ﬁtting to
Pittsburgh tradition, they were playing in

I the ﬁrst all—steel—and-concrete stadium.

Roberto Clemente was a young star for
the Pirates, and he represented how Latin
[American] players could play in the major
leagues, despite racism against them.”
McKinley has now stepped on home
plate more than 200 times. I
“I love stepping on home plate, because

‘ when I give tours, dads freak out about it,

which always remindslme of my dad. My
dad instilled my love of sports in me, which
is part of the reason I like Pittsburgh — it’s
such a sports town,” she said.

Junior Brittany, Mitlo -also loves the
sports traditions that unify Pittsburgh and
the Pitt community.

“My favorite Pitt tradition is taking the -

busses from campus to Heinz Field for the
football games, because I think it’s one of
the best bonding experiences for Pitt stu-
dents. Everyone on the bus is always en-
ergetic and excited about the game — it’s
where you feel and see the most Pitt pride,”
Mitlo said. '

_ Of course, men can’t participate in Lan-
tern Night, and not every Pitt student loves
sports. But on a, campus ﬁrmly supported
by passionate alumni, in a progressive city
with a rich history, no student will graduate
without a tradition or two to cherish. I

iii alum Mahmoud Jibrif headed the Naticmailfransitioai ﬁauncii after rebellion

_ —
broke out in Libya. MCT Campus , i ll

Gideon Bradshaw
Stqfj’ W rziter

Not many Pitt graduate students dream of
taking the reins of authority in ﬂedgling
democracies. But Mahmoud Jibril did just
that when a rebellion broke out in Libya

_ last year.

Jibril, who earned a master’s in 1980
and a Ph.D. in 1985, both from Pitt’s po-
litical science department, headed the
transitional government, the National
Transitional Council, as prime minister in
the North African nation during the revo-
lution against dictator Moammar Gadhaﬁ.
Though Jibril stepped down from power
following the overthrow of the Libyan
leader, Jibril has played a signiﬁcant role in
a pivotal moment in Libya’s history.

Vijay Prashad, who analyzed the Libyan
uprising in his book “Arab Spring, Libyan
Winter,” published last May, said that prior
to the revolution, Jibril oversaw a devel-
opment project with Gadhaﬁ’s politically
prominent son, Saif-al—Islam. Following
the outbreak of the rebellion in early 2011,
Jibril joined the rebel forces.

Bert Rockman, who is currently a visit-
ing scholar at Pitt and who was a member
of the political’ science faculty when Jibril
attended the University, remembered the
Libyan politician as “open—minded” and
“brilliant.”

Rockman said Jibril worked with the
Gadhaﬁ regime because he saw a chance to
improve conditions in Libya. ’

“[Jibril] took the civil service job, I
think, because he saw it asa way to mod-
ernize the country,” Rockman said.

Sami Hermez, a visiting professor at
Pitt who lectures on contemporary inter-
national issues, characterized Jibril as a
leader who consolidated power success-

fully around himself during the early days ‘

of the uprising.

As a political leader for the rebel forces,
Prashad said that Jibril, who had achieved
advanced degrees in the U.S. and lived
outside of Libya, communicated more ef-
fectively with Western leaders like then-
French-President Nicolas Sarkozy than
-with many of the rebels’ military leaders. ‘

‘Many of the latter, Prashad explained,
While experienced in ﬁghting, also sub-
scribed to Islamist ideology.

“[Jibril] became the acceptable face of
the rebellion in Benghazi,” which was the
rebel.capital city at that time, Prashad said.

Jibril headed the National Transitional
Council until Gadhaﬁ’s death in October of
last year, at which point he stepped down
from power. Since then, Jibril has contin-
ued to play a role in Libyan politics and
currently heads the National Forces Alli-

- ance.

Hermez remarked that with the fall of
Gadhaﬁ’s government, many government
institutions also collapsed. Additionally,
a large number of the rebel factions, of-
ten with their tribal and political loyalties
that may supercede those they hold for
the central government in Tripoli, have re-
mained armed. Consequently, the central
government must work to consolidate its
authority while rebuilding many state in-
stitutions. . ”

However, Rockman acknowledged that
the task cut out for Jibril and other Libyan
officials is not an easy ‘one, as the new gov-
ernment rebuilds itself and works to con-
solidate authority.

“Anybody who’s founding a new regime
has their work cut out for them, especially
if they’re trying to do that in a way that is
civilized and democratic,” he said.

The Libyan government did not re-
spond to multiple requests for comment
on this story. I

Pitt athletic facilities improved
by ‘Quest for Excellence’

Dave Uhrmacher & RJ Sepich
The Pitt News Staff

When recruiting athletes to play colle-
giately at a Division I school such as Pitt,
the quality of the athletic facilities are
paramount in landing talented student-
athletes.

And Pitt has hadnumerous athletic fa-l

cilities over the years — both state—of—the—
art and out-of-date.

In recent years, the University’s “Quest

for Excellence” — an initiative developed
by the athletic department to enhance the
quality of facilities —— has resulted in im-
proved playing environments for almost
all Pitt sports, allowing for coaches to re-
cruit higher—caliber players and experi-
ence greater team success than in recent
years.

Here’s a rundown of the evolution of

Pitt-’s on- and off-campus‘ athletic facilities: '

Pitt Stadium (Opened -—— Sept. 1, 1925;
Closed — Nov. 13, 1999)

At a time in 1924 when the Pitt football
program enjoyed great success, more fans
wanted to watch the Panthers than Forbes
Fieldcould allow. "

So the University made the decision to
build an on—campus stadium to ﬁx the seat-
ing problem. .

Finished at a cost of about $2 million,
Pitt Stadium, previously located where the
Petersen Events Center currently stands,
became the home of numerous athletic
teams, including Pitt football, both soccer

teams, track and ﬁeld and even the Pitts-

burgh Steelers for a short time.

At a full capacity of about 60,000, Pitt
students, alumni and other fans were able
to ﬁll the stadium for the Panthers as they
pursued conference and national champi-
onships.

Located underneath one of the gates of‘,
Pitt Stadium, Pitt Pavilion was home to the

Panthers basketball program from‘ 1925 to
1951. .

As the stadium aged, Pitt made the deci-
sion to move the football program’s home
games to the new Heinz Field and demol-
ish Pitt Stadium in favor of a new basket-
ball arena and a dormitory.

At_the last game at Pitt Stadium in No-
vember 1999, more than 60,000 attended
as the Panthers upset Notre 'Dame, 37-
27, prompting mass celebrations as fans
rushed the ﬁeld with nine seconds left in
the game.

“The game is not over. The game is not
over,” Pitt Stadium’s public announcer fa-
mously yelled.

The students and fans didn’t care.'They
wanted take a part of Pitt Stadium home
with them, including pieces of the ﬁeld,
seats and even parts of the bathrooms.

A few weeks later, nothing was left of

Pitt Stadium after it was demolished in De-
cember 1999. «

Fitzgerald Field House (Opened — Dec.
15. 1951) ’ A

Named after former Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald, the Field House is the cur-
rent home ‘of Pitt gymnastics, wrestling,
volleyball and indoor track and ﬁeld.

In terms of amenities, the on-campus
building houses a spacious athletic train-

ing and ‘weightlifting facility, impressive “

new locker rooms just added in the most
recent renovation and a new wrestling
facility. The wrestling team now enjoys a
matted practice room, new -cardio equip-
ment and a video and recruitment room
for coaches and athletes. I

“Our facilities at the Fitz are some of
the best in the country,” wrestling head
coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “The Olym-

pic sports weight room has every possible ‘

piece of equipment that we could ever use.
Our wrestling is heads and tails above
where it was [before it was renovated].” .

“It really is one of the top wrestling
rooms'in the country,” he added.

The Fitzgerald Field House also housed
the Pitt basketball program for more than
50 years (1951 to 2002), and some of the
most memorable moments in the build-
ing’s history took place with the Panthers’
hoops squad in action, such as Jerome
Lane’s«famous backboard-shattering dunk
in 1988. ~ '

Heinz Field (Opened — Aug. 18, 2001)

Heinz Field has been the home of the
Panthers’ football program since the 2001
season. v _

The athletes enjoy their very own 5,000
square-foot locker room, while PantherVi-
sion, the Great Hall and all the other great

’ features that Heinz Field offers keep fans

comfortable in the home of the Pittsburgh

' Steelers.

, Despite the off-campus stadium on
Pittsburgh’s North Side having its critics,
65,000 fans are able to enjoy the beauti-
ful views of the Pittsburgh skyline and Mt.
Washington from Heinz Field.

And there are no signs that Pitt football
will want to leave the stadium for an on-
campus site anytime soon, especially since
the Steelers also work with the Panthers at
the incredible UPMC Sports Performance
Complex on the South Side, where Pitt
football practices.

April 27, 2002) H -

tiful upper campus, the Petersen Events

Students attending Pitt in the early ’60s expe-
rienced a much different University than stu-
dents encounter today — and not just because
of the decade’s cultural climate. For one thing,
Pitt was a private university.

In the bitter ﬁght between Pennsylva-
nia and the University regarding Pitt’s state
ﬁmding, University officials threatened the
unthinkable: turning Pitt_back into a private
school. While Pitt spent most of its 225 years
at private status rather than public, in recent
decades Pitt has subjected itself to a number
of regulations and conditions in exchange for
partial ﬁnancial support from the state.

Tuition prices, faculty salaries, gover-
nance, endowment investment, renovation
requirements and several other issues are im-
pacted by a university’s status_ as public or pri-
vate. At a public school or state-related school

’ such as Pitt, rules governing these issues de-

pend on the state and state ﬁinding.

James Garland, author of “Saving Alma
Mater: A Rescue plan for America’s Public Uni-
versities” and former college dean and presi-
dent at Miami University of Ohio, said that

. there are “ﬁle cabinets full” of state regula-

tions that are imposed on public universities.

According to Pitt’s online timeline outlin-
ing its 225-year history, the University went
state-related in 1966 when Pennsylvania Gov.
William Scranton signed the bill, making Pitt
part of the Commonwealth System of Higher
Education. Transitioning from a private insti-
tution, Pitt lowered tuition and accepted state-
appointed members, on its Board of Trustees.

Garland said Pitt became a public insti-
tution at the point when the typical public
university received close to 70 percent of its
revenue from the state government and the
remaining 30 percent came from student fees,
tuition and gifts from alumni. At this time,
students could pay a college tuition with sum-
mer job earnings, as the state assumed a large
portion’ of remaining tuition burdens, some-
.thing that Garland said is now impossible.

“It’s all a part of the tragedy that-we are see-
ing,” he said. “It’s the devastation of America’s
public university system.”

Garland said that America’s public univer-
sities educate 80 percent of the nation’s col-
lege students and that over the past century,
state support for public schools has dimin-
ished to focus on other demands, such as in-
frastructure, health care and prisons.

According to Pitt, “Pennsylvania’s contri-
bution to Pitt’s armual budget has diminished
steadily, from more than 30 percent in the
rnid—197os to less than 10 percent in 2011.”

In February, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
spoke before the Pennsylvania Senate Appro-
priations Committee and said that in Pitt’s

1960s decision to turn to a public institution '

“there was _a desire both to meet the growing
demand from Pennsylvanians for reasonably
priced but high quality university experiences
and to invest in anchor institutions that could
help fuel both social vibrancy and economic
growth in Pennsylvania’s two major urban ar-

3!

-....«.

Pitt talks move to private status

Nordenberg described the creiitirfn threi

State System of Higher Educatioiii;  ;‘c/at—r
egorized Pitt, Penn State and Temple as “com—
monwealth universities” focused in research,
as he argued against disproportionate budget
cuts proposed by Gov. Tom Corbett’s state
budget plan, which included $41.7 million in
cuts to Pitt’s state appropriations.

“Given this impressive record of success,
the Commonwealth’s current retreat from
support for its public research universities
must be viewed as very problematic by any-
one concerned about the next generation of
Pennsylvanians or about Pennsylvania’s next-
generation economy,” Nordenberg said in his
statement to the committee.

This summer, the state legislature decided

to maintain Pitt’s $136 million appropriation --

from the last ﬁscal year, and the University
increased in- and-out—of—state tuition by 3 per-
cent at the end ofjune.

Tuition is often one of the top concerns
when comparing public and private schools.

Scott Jaschik, an editor and co—founder of
Inside Higher Ed, an online news source of
higher education issues, said that Pennsylva-
nia is an unusual state, as there are multiple
cases where universities were once private
and turned public. But the transition, he said,
depends on perspective.

“Pitt, as a state-related institution that
only receives partial public funding, is largely
affected by state appropriations,” he said.
“But on the other. hand," most privates don’t
have endowments the size of public schools
and largely need to support their budgets by
their students. So people often have a concep-
tion that privates live on easy street, but I am
not sure if that is “true.”

Jaschik said that public schools often have a
different sense of mission than private schools

' and place the issues of states and regions ﬁrst.

“So Pitt may ask, ‘What are the needs of
Pittsburgh?’ or, ‘What are the needs of Penn-
sylvania?’ instead of focusing on issues of the
University itself, such as tuition,” he said. “It’s
a large issue of accountability. If you are Carn-
egie Mellon, you are not going to get hauled

‘in front of legislature all that often to answer

questions aboutbudge'ts.”

Garland said that if a group of university
presidents and chancellors are in a room, the
possibilities of a public school going private
always come up.

“Ifs talked about incessantly,~and in many
cases they can make a good case for it,” Gar-
land said. “I believe that many would move to
privatization, but there are , forces opposing
universities, such as state legislatures who
aren’t willing to relinquish control.” a , 7

Jaschik agreed that it would be diﬂicult for
a school such as Pitt to revert back to a private
status. He said that while there are possibili-
ties for public schools to receive more auton-
omy,. states often play a role in constructing
university. buildings or own portions of cam-
pus property —

Garland said thattransitioning Pitt back to
a private school to decrease some of the stress
from state ﬁinding cuts is a theoretical possi-

unhurried and confident. Though usu-
ally serious looking, he was grinning

‘broadly today and frequently joking with

the youngsters. The whole thing went off
with clocklike precision, despite the hub-
bub created by reporters and cameramen

P witnessing the start of the biggest tests
— yet to be conducted with the Pitt vac-

cine.”

Dr. Robert Korns, Francis’ deputy
director of the vaccine evaluation pro-
gram, lauded the vaccine in a 113-page
evaluation report. .

“In strong statistical language, the
historic trial of the vaccine and its subse-
quent analysis was revealed,” the report
said. “There can be no doubt now that
children can be inoculated successfully
against polio. There can be no doubt that
humanity can pull itself up by its own
bootstraps and protect its children from

the insidious invasion of the ultra-micro— I ' ‘

scopic disease.” .
According_to the Salk Institute for Bi-
ological Studies — which opened its first
laboratory in -1963 —_in the two years
before the vaccine was made available,

the average number of polio cases in the '

U.S. was more than 45,000. By 1962, that
number dropped to 910.

Peter Salk said his father wanted the
vaccine to be named after Pitt to empha-

size that the research and final product’ ‘
I of the vaccine was a team effort, but even

when it was used in the media, Salk was
viewed as the hero.

In 1956, Salk was awarded the Con-
gressional Gold Medal, the-highest civil-
ian-honor granted by the United States
Congress, for his work with the polio
Vaccine.

It would be years before Salk would
be able to go back to his laboratoryin
Pittsburgh without the media attention
and accolades overwhelming him. On his
first day back at the University, he spoke

to reporters.

“I have a laboratory furnished=by pub-
lic funds. Do I use ‘it, or do I become a

a movie star? No more scoops.”

Salk’s connections and relationship
to the University still remain evident on
campus today, more than 50 years after
the vaccine was made public and more
than 15 years since his death in 1995.

The building where he conducted his
research now bears his name. Salk Hall
houses Pitt’s School of Pharmacy and the
School of Dental Medicine and is con-
sidered a historic landmark by the Pitts-
burgh History and Landmarks Founda-
tion.

In April 2005, Pitt hosted a three—day

reception and symposium to celebrate
the polio vaccine’s 50th anniversary.

   

Peter Salk also started his own pro-
gram named for his father, the Jonas
Salk Legacy Foundation, and its website‘
states that it isl“dedicated to preserving
and extending the contributions of one
of society’s great scientists and humani-

‘ tarians.” Peter Salk serves as the organi-

zation’s president, and Pitt Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg is one of the six board
advisers. ‘

Peter is dedicated to bringing even
more of his father’s legacy back to Pitt’s

campus. The legendary doctor’s son said

he’s been in talks with the University to
plan an event for 2014 to commemorate

‘what would be the year of Jonas Salk’s

100th birthday.

Peter Salk said his father was very
interested in his own philosophy, which
is evident in the publication of his four
books between 1972 and 1983.

“He was thinking of where we are as at’ '

species,” Peter Salk said. “He asked the
question: ‘Are we being good ancestors?”’

administrators would be unable to prevent
him from completing the project.

In 1933, the University received an
early Christmas gift from the Civil Works
Administration: a $300,000 labor grant
for work on the looming tower. Labor re-
sumed its 24-hour-a-day schedule, em-
ploying 1,259 laborers until April of 1934,
when the program ended.

A second campaign began with the
practical slogan of “Finish the Cathedral”
and the hope of raising another $2.6 mil-
lion. Failing miserably, i it raised only
$635,000. But in October, the ﬁnal exte-
rior stones were put into place.

However, the Commons Room, what
Bowman had dreamt of being “the heart
and soul of the building [...] a room that
will so grip a boy that he will never enter
it with his hat on,” was nowhere near com-
pletion. Bowman returned to Andrew Mel-
lon, seeking another half—million dollars.

Mellon agreed on the premise that no
publicity about the gift was to be made.

Finally, on June 4, 1937, Chancellor
Bowman placed the ﬁnal stone — a gift
from the graduating class — into the Com-

mons Room. Within the “ho‘llow‘ capsule‘ to
be usedéas the ‘ﬁnal block lay a copy of The
Pitt News, a list of donors, progress photo-
graphs and other documents —- all printed
on paper designed to last half a century.

The building containing 17 Nationality
Rooms, 87 classrooms, 113 laboratories,
19 libraries, 80 conference rooms and
dozens of other rooms, had ﬁnally been
completed.

Walter Albert Jessup, president of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching, called it “the most daring and
the most beautiful thing ever attempted on
a university campus” at a commencement
speech onjune 9.

The work Bowman and Mitchell started
is still continuing, mainly due to Bruhns’
work with the Nationality Rooms. Since
Bruhns’ arrival in 1967, numerous rooms
have been created, along with several dif-
ferent study abroad scholarships.

“I’m still building rooms, and we’re
working on another room  a Korean
one. And I’m doing my little bit to bring
this to completion,” Bruhns said.

- “It’s the pride of the community to de-
cide to raise a room, and then they stay to-
gether to raise money so Pitt students can
go study for ﬁve weeks in their country. It’s
international awareness brought to life.”I

set to be demolished after the season, the Pan-
thers prepared to face favored Notre Dame —
wanting to ensure that Pitt won its last game
at the storied stadium.

More than 60,000 fans showed up to wit-
ness Pitt upset Notre Dame, 37-27, and, after-
ward,’ many fans rushed the ﬁeld and dug up
bits of the turf to take a piece of Pitt Stadium

. home with them.

“Itwas a pressure—packed and emotionally
charged game, and the fans were there from
the start,” Pitt head coach Walt Harris said
after the game. “I don’t know what we can do
for an encore.” _ ,_

6. Tony Dorsett rushes for 303 yards to
upset Notre Dame (Nov. 15, 1975)

After losing 12 straight games against Notre
Dame, Pitt entered the 1975 matchup against
the No. 9 Fighting Irish with a secret weapon
— junior running'back Tony Dorsett.

As a preview of what he would accomplish
in the next season, Dorsett carried the Pan-
thers to their ﬁrst victory over Notre Dame in
more than a decade. He rushed for 303 yards
on just'23 carries as Pitt upset the Fighting
Irish at Pitt Stadium, 34-20. I

Not only did Dorsett set -the Pitt all—time
record for rushingyards in a single game that
day, he also set the record for most rushing
yards allowed by a Notre Dame defense.

5._]erome Lane’s shattering dunk (Jan.
25, 1988)

Arguably one of the greatest dunks in all
of college basketball history, Jerome Lane re-
ceived a pass from Pitt point guard Sean Miller
and slammed the ball home with so much fe-
rocity that the backboard literally exploded.

Lane’s power brought down the frameof

the backboard in the Fitzgerald Field House
and sent glass pouring all over the court. The
jaw-dropping moment gave the fans some-
thjngto remember for years, while also giving
ESPN a highlight to run for ages.

To this day, Pitt fans will often mock the
famous call by ESPN’s Bill Raﬁery by yelling,
“Send it in, Jerome! .

4. Pitt’s ﬁrst Big East Tournament cham-
pionship (March 15, 2003)”

A list of top moments in Pitt history would
be nothing if championships were absent.

In Ben Howland’s last season as head coach
of the Pitt basketball team, the Panthers would

‘win their ﬁrst Big East tournament title over

UConn, 74-56.

Pitt only led by one at the half, but thanks -

to Brandin Knight —— who played in the game
with a heavily sprained ankle —Jaron Brown

and Julius Page, the Panthers pulled away in

the second half.

After the game, Knight — now an assistant
for Coachjamie Dixon —— told reporters that
if he could walk, he could play.

“I wasn’t going to miss this game for any-
thing,” he said. “The only way to miss it would
have been if I coulc_ln’t walk.”

3. Pitt wins the 1982 Sugar Bowl (Jan.
1, 1982)

With 42 seconds remaining and down by
three, Pitt quarterback Dan Marino heaved a
pass to the end zone on 4th-and-5 from the
Georgia 33-yard line.

In one of the best plays in college football ‘

history, tight end John Brown hauled in the
pass despite taking a big hit, earning a 24-20
victory for the‘Panthers over the Bulldogs.
' Brown didn’t even know the ball was com-
ing until it was already out of Marino’s hands.
“When I looked up, there was the ball,”

BASKETBALL

Despite Tay1or’s departure, Howland’s
squad did not suffer from a lack of talent.
Senior standout guard Ricardo Greer and
future Al1—American Brandin Knight, one
of Willard’s recruits, led the charge for
success.

“[Howland] had to talk Knight into
sticking with his commitment to Willard.
And he had to sell leftover players on the
idea of working hard, playing defense and
sharing in the motion offense. [Howland]
credits Greer with helping to build their
program. He bought in — he convinced
the others,” Finder said.

With Howland came change and con-

sistency, two things the 'Pitt program had ‘

been missing for decades. In his second
season, the Panthers surprisingly ad-
vanced to the Big East Tournament cham-
pionship game and the NIT. The 12,508-
seat Petersen Events Center was built to
provide the Panthers with a more ad-
equate practice facility and a competitive
home—cour1: advantage.
Then began the most successful decade
of Pittbasketball since the 1920s.
The Panthers won back-to-back Big
,-East regular season championships in
2003 and 2004 and won the Big East tour-
nament in 2003. The team advanced to the

Sweet 16 in 2002 and 2003. Coach How-

land was named the Big East Coach of the
Year and Naismith College Coach of the

Something’ wa  t bhflt 1-M3-
land. His style of coaching and his recruit-
ing tactics attracted players that were
good matches for the conference’s physi-
cal style of play.

“[Howland and Dixon] won with ath-
letes from the suburbs. They had them
shoot 3-pointers, made them into tena-
cious defenders,” Finder said. “They still

went after the athletes — the kids who"

. work and teach and draw on each player’s

selﬂess personality. They wanted guys to
stick around foﬁyears, lending leadership
and «charac-teiilGuys they could build ban-
ners around,” Finder said.

After Pitt dominated Connecticut in the

knowledged that the Panthers were an ex-
tremely tough team.

us down with their mental toughness,”
Calhoun said. “They held us to 19 points in
the second half and won the game with de-
fense and by doing a terriﬁc job of control-
ling their own offense and defense.”
- When Howland left Pitt in 2003 to ac-
cept’ his dream‘ job as head coachof UCLA
— ﬁnishing with an 89-40 recordlat Pitt
— it seemed only right for Dixon to take
over- the program.
Dixon has continued the style of play

that Howland taught him and has amassed
an incredible cumulative 238-77 record
since he took over.

“What Ben Howland did in resurrecting
the program, and the wayjamie Dixon has
continued that [success], is phenomenal,”
famous basketball anchor Dick Vitale said
in a broadcast.

Though last year ended in disappoint-
ing fashion for the Panthers .— tied for
13th place in the Big East and missing the
NCAA Tournament for the ﬁrst time in a
decade — past success indicates a bright- '~’
er future for Dixon’s squad in the 2012-
2013 season.

One thing is certain: Change is coming
for the Pitt basketball program, but not in
the form of a new coach, just a new con-
ference. As the team plays its ﬁnal games
in the Big.East, Coach Dixon will have to
adapt his recruiting game and perhaps his
team’s playing style, as well.

“When a Steven Adams comes with the 7
possibility of a short career,‘it seems to
signal a change,” said Finder of Pitt's new
recruiting tactics. “It will be interesting to
see if Dixon recruits the brawn, physical ‘
player in the Atlantic Coa_s_t’Conference,
where more ﬁnesse and speed rule.” -

Despite their respective struggles, Ev-
ans, Willard and especially Howland built
the foundation for Dixon’s success.

And even though the caliber of players
committing to Pitt has greatly improved,
the ideals of teamwork, toughness and re-
siliency will always make the Pitt basket-
ball program a proud one.‘ I

attended Central Catholic High School before
coming to Pitt. '

Although a national title eluded Marino, the
most memorable game of his collegiate career
was the 1982 Sugar Bowl as the quarterback
led the Panthers to a last-minute victory over
Georgia.

Still a raw talent entering the NFL Draft,
ﬁve other quarterbacks were drafted above
Marino before the Miami Dolphins selected
him late in the ﬁrst round. It was a decision
they wouldn’t regret.

Marino torched NFL defenses and rewrote
the passing record book from 1983 to 1999,
earning nine trips to the Pro Bowl and one MVP
award as he threw for more than 60,000 yards.

Marino was later inducted to the Pro Foot-
ball Hall of Fame in 2005, and his j ersey num-
ber, 13, is retired by Pitt.

2._]ohn Bain “joc ” Sutherland (football,
end, 1915-1917; headcoach, 1924-1938)

Simply put, he is still the greatest coach in
Pitt football history.

Sutherland compiled arecord of 111-20-12,
and his teams. lay claim to ﬁve of Pitt’s nine
national championships. Along with Pop War-
ner, Sutherland was one of the true engineers
behind the national powerhouse Pitt football
became in its early years.

Sutherland was an All-American player at
Pitt, playing for the famous undefeated 1917

team dubbed “The Fighting Dentists” because
most of the players, including Sutherland,= were
dental students. .

After leaving Pitt to coach the Brooklyn
Dodgers football team, Sutherland fought in
World War II and, upon returning, coached the
Pittsburgh Steelers for two years.

His contributions to the University were
further recognized in 1992, when a residence
hall bearing his name opened on upper cam-
pus.

1. Tony Dorsett (football, running back,
1973-1976)

Not everyone gets a street named after him
or her outside Heinz Field.

Still considered one of the greatest college
football players of all time, Dorsett was truly a
once—in—a-generation talent.

He led the Panthers to their most recent
national championship-in 1976, rushing for

1,948 yards. That same season, he set the all- »

time collegiate rushing mark a 6,082 yards
— a record that stood until Ricky Williams of
Texas broke it in 1998. /

Drafted second overall by the‘Dallas Cow-
boys, Dorsett enjoyed a pro career equal to his
stellar collegiate career.

Earning four trips to the Pro Bowl and help-
ing the Cowboys win Super Bowl XII, Dorsett
ﬁnished with 12,739 yards and 92 touchdowns
when he retired in 1989.

Dorsett remains the only Pitt football player
to win the prestigious Heisman Trophy, and
his jersey number, 33, was rightfully retired
by the football program. I

Pitt’s last national championship was nearly
orchestrated solely on the athletic ability of
senior running back Tony Dorsett.

The 1976 Heisman Trophy winner led the

nation that year with 1,948 rushing yards — _

setting college football’s all-time rushing re-
cord in the process -—- to propel the Panthers
totheir ﬁrst undefeated season since 1937.

The entire season proved to be a declara- -

tion of supremacy for Pitt, so when the Pan-
thers met Georgia in the SugarBowl with the
national title on the line, there was never any
doubt who would win. Behind Dorsett’s 202

Debating Pitt’sathletic identity:

Jasper Wilson
Assz'sta7zt Sports Editor

Although at times it seems like neither is
true, I’ve often wondered whether Pitt is a
football or a basketball school.

What are the criteria for answering -
such a question? History, fan support, suc-
cess or name recognition, perhaps?

_ These are just a few standards that I
used to help ﬁnd the answer. _ _ ‘

Pitt’s lack of an on-campus football sta-
dium greatly hinders .its clout as a_ football
school. But there-are football schools that
have made the arrangement work, such as
Miami and Southern California. A constant
between both of those programs has been
continued success throughout the years.

For many years now, Pitt hasn’t had the
sustained level of signiﬁcant success to
consistently attract fans to football games
or get them to stay all four quarters.

Meanwhile, the shock response to the
Pitt men’s basketball team’s struggles last
yearwas much greater nationally than that
of the football team.

But the impending move to the Atlantic
Coast Conference may shift the balance
back to football. I doubt head coach Paul
Chryst would’ve left a high—proﬁle coordi-
nator position at Big Ten power Wisconsin
to come to Pitt if he didn’t think it was a

When applying to Pitt as a high school
senior, I’knew about the moderate success
in football at the beginning of the new mil-
lennium, but the reputation of the basket-
ball program had a greater inﬂuence on my
decision. _ .

M Pitt Stadium’s demolition in 1999 and
the subsequent erection of the Petersen
Events Center in 2002 showed that the
administration saw potential in basketball
and believed that Pitt could be both a foot-
ball and a basketball school.

Van Beck Hall, a history teacher at Pitt
since 1964, said last spring that the build-
ing of the Pete sent an undeniable mes-
sage. . ’ - ‘

“Replacing the [football] stadium with
the Petersen Events Center really showed:
‘Hey, basketball is No. 1 on campus. It’s
here,’” Hall said. - ‘

Hall, who had season football tickets
at Pitt Stadium, stopped going to foot-
ball games once the team moved to Heinz
Field.

“When they moved to the North Side, I
said, ‘I’m not going to go over to the North
Side. That’s bullsh*t,”’ he said.

While the basketball team started expe-

riencing great success at the beginning of .

the century, the football team also began
to recover from its mediocre record during

a Does football or basketball rule?

the ’90s, according to recently deceased
Pitt alumnus, former sports information
directorand ESPN college football pundit
Beano Cook. .

“Football had more support until they
became miediocre for so many years. It
started in the ’9os — that’s when it got
pretty bad,” Cook said last spring.

During that decade, Pitt averaged four
wins a season and failed to win at least half
of its games for eight of those ten years.

Pitt men’s basketball attendance has
never ranked among the_top 10 or 25 Di-
vision I programs, but this is understand-
-able, given the relatively small capacity
(12,508 seats) of the Petersen Events Cen-
ter. ~
But to see how students feel on the mat-
ter, look no further than the Oakland Zoo

student section. Despite the team’s poor _

-record last season, the Zoo drew large
numbers of students into the stands.

“For Rutgers, Louisville, Georgetown
and West Virginia, the Zoo was at 90 per-
cent full or better, with Louisville-and West
Virginia being sell—outs,” Zoo leaders re-
ported in a post on the group’s website at
the end of February.

While last year, with the football team
also struggling to a 6-7 record under head
coach ‘Todd Graham, students routinely
left "football games in droves after the sing-

ing of “Sweet Caroline,” if they bothered to 5
show up at all.

The student showings at the two
weekday-night ESPN national broadcasts‘
were also poor. The trend of students not
making a collective effort to attend these
games proves that basketball is where the»?
students’ primary interest lies.

Pitt athletics doesn’t release records of
student ticket sales for either sport.

Pitt has an established history in foot-.
ball going back decades and has existed
since 1890, but that history — eight of
Pitt’s nine claimed football national cham-
pionships came before World War II -- is
no longer relevant to the athletic identity
of the school.

“There’s just no interest in the Big East
football because it’s by far the worst [Bowl
Championship Series] conference,” Cook?‘

‘said.

Basketball hadn’t had constant success
for many years until Ben Howland took
over as head coach in 1999, ﬁnishing in
the bottom half of the Big East standings
in almost every year during the ’90s. The
program has existed since 1905.7

Cook said a more pivotal moment than
the events of 1999 occurred with the for-

lighting has also made evening games pos-
sible for the past two years.

“The Petersen Sports Complex is a
great step for our program,” said Dani-
elle Benner, a redshirt junior on the Pitt
women’s soccer team. “Playing where we
did before ——— Founders Field — was like
playing at a neutral site. It was 45 minutes
away, so we really didn’t have home games.
It just never felt like our own.”

‘ “‘The new facility is something that’s
ours, something special, something to play
for,” she added. “We have a great view of
downtown, and it kind of reminds you that
you are playing for more than yourself.”

‘ To accompany the current facilities, a
new track—and—ﬁeld complex will be built

mation of the Big East and Pitt’sl joining the

‘conference as one of its charter members.

And now, the upcoming move to the
ACC was one undeniably dictated by foot-
ball and the money that goes along with it,
according to Dick Groat, a western—Penn—
sylvania native who has covered college
basketball for 33 years as a Pitt basketball
radio analyst.

“Obviously, football is the reason [for
the move], and the money that’s involved
in the ACC is much bigger than the ‘Big
East,” Groat said last spring.

But Groat, an All—American college bas-
ketball player at Duke before starring for
the Pittsburgh Pirates, thinks it’s possible
for football and basketball to succeed si_—
multaneously at Pitt.

“There’s no reason why the University

can’t be tops in both basketball and foot— »
’ ball,” he said. ' _
For example, Chryst’s former employer, _

Wisconsin, has had signiﬁcant success in

, both sports in recent years.
But Groat believes Pitt will be a basket— _

ball school as long as_Jamie Dixon is the
head coach. A
“As long as [Dixon’s] here, Pitt will be

"a dominant force in whatever conference

they play in basketball-wise,” he said.
I agree.
