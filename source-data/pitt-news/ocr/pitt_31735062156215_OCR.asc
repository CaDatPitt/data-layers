Asked By Legislators

Student Congressmay exhume the late Student Faculty

Blennds this -year.

I

Acting on a motion by Adele‘ Marraccini, the legislators
decided thatthe ‘program of informal get togethers for stu-

dents and faculty should be tried 0’ "“'  A _
 ‘Hotel ballroom. He explained that 5

again.

In the past, the so called
“Blennds” have been relative fail-
ures‘for what one SC member
called “two reasons: ﬁrst, not

enough faculty.”
Publicity Poses Problem '

. Better publicity seemed to be

 the recommendation of the group

  

V the

‘ erings,

 

‘noted that

to the new Blennds chairman who
is not yet appointed. Larry Adler
regardless of the
amount of publicity, students and
faculty people will not attend un-
less they are “sold on them.” 3

Congress Prexy Jack Burwinkel
asked members of SC to think

about capable people for the job.

In her talk for the revival of
Blennds, Adele Marraccini
said thata creative and imagina-
tive chairman could make the
events popular and regular gath-
She said that the entire
project should not be considered
in the light of last year’s failures.
V The plan to" revive the Blennds
was passed with one dissenting
vote. .
Owl Sales A Problem

The problem of OWL sales
came up again in SC. Dan Berger
Warned that due to poor circu-
lation this year, "the proﬁt made
by previous editions of the year-
book might be used up, and that
next year’s volume might suffer.

He asked if Congress ‘couldmake
a recommendation to the admin-
istration that the price of the OWL
be-included in each senior’s grad-
uation fee.

Larry Adler, publications board
representative, told the group that

_ previous Congresses had _brought

up the same idea, and the appro-
val had reached a high level in
the University’s proceedural chan-
nels, but that it had never gone

‘ all the way to the trustees.

Panthers, Get Into Act

Bob Osterhout, still working on
the almost forgotten live panthers,

“reported _that the latest scheme,

the one to house the Panthers in
the University, may have to con-
sider the Pemisylvania State

because of the midwinter date of

She Says Before
Passing Out

Being chairman of the annual
blood drive takes a lot out of a
person. .

Jim and Jean Rock, co-chair-
men of last year’s drive, both
fainted (as many he-men do)

‘when the needle was taken out
of their arms.

, Isabel Lubovsky, co-chairman
of this year’s drive, said, before
giving her pint of, plasma, “Of
course I won’t faint,”

v She did. That makes the sec-'
ond successive year ‘that the co-‘
chairmen have fainted. At Pitt
that’s a__tra.dition! '

Withf‘Cou11seling, Activities; 
No Time for Mystery Stories . 

BY JACK FITZGERALD

If Dr. Paul H. Masoner’s ‘salary varied directly with
his amount of free time, he would surely be a poor man.

An associate professor in the School of Education, he".
divides his day—devoting nine-tenths to counselingjand the

including teaching. "

-Prior to his arrival at,_,_Pitt in
1945, Dr.“ Masoner became very
,much interested in the ﬁeld of
counseling. He. held the role of
counselor as» well as teacher and
vice principal at Bellevue High
School, and was once Administra-
tion Head at P.enn State.

Started Here In 1945

In 1945, his initial job at Pitt
was connected with the Veterans
Guidance Center. Since -then, his
work has been’ concerned primari-
ly with counseling.

In this ﬁeld he has met many
students, both graduates and un-
dergraduates. He says that with
each one his lrnowledge of stu-
dentproblems has increased tr}e-
mendously.

During his stay here, Dr. Mason-
er has been very much impressed
with the school in general. In his
opinion, the large college can be
just as personal as the small one.
According to him, Pitt proves this
point adequately. '.

‘ Faculty-Student Relations Good

He states, “I have never been
any place other than Pitt where
the friendship is as close as that
between the faculty and students.”
He admits that the real pleasure
he receives from his job stems
from his genuine interest in peo-
ple. '1

Dr. Masoner has some advice for
the large number of undergrads
who use college as a period of ori-
entation. To avoid this, he recom-
mends that freshman students give
more serious thought to their fu-
ture. According to Dr. Masoner,

receiving guidance from a com-
petent counselor. and using voca-

Women Offered Comissions

Second Army Headquarters has announced the schedule
of active duty reporting dates for women volunteers.

According to Major M. A. Alex, senior unit instructor
of the Organized Army Reserve Corps Center of the Pitts-

burgh District, inquiries from
women applying for commissions
must be received at headquarters
in Fort Meade, Maryland, six
weeks before the reporting~dates
of Jan. 3'0, Mar. 27, or May 8.

Under the present reserve pro-
gram, eligible college graduates
can apply for commissions up to
the grade of captain in the Wom-
en’s Army Corps.

The eligibility requirements are

\

abachelor degree, minimum age
of 21 years, mental, moral and

physical ﬁtness, unmarried status
and United States citizenship.

Applications blanks may be ob-

tained from the ORC; Center or .

town Gap Military Reservation,

tional aids are two of the best

-ways to reach a ,dicision. '

If this were accomplished, he

, feels certain that -future ‘frustra-

tion could be avoided. His ex-

perience with many similar

cases has led him to this con-
clusion. ’

Counseling, however, is not his
only interest. Some of the many -
organizations with which he is af- '
ﬁliated include Kappa Phi Kappa,

YMCA, of wh_ich he is vice presi—. r

dent, Pitt Chest committee, High
School Day committee and Omic-
ron Delta Kappa. ‘ Concerning the

latter, Dr. Masoner states, “The '

greatest honor bestowed on me

was being tapped to an honorary
fraternity such as ODK.”

Has Three Children
"A native of Middletown, Ohio,
Dr. Masoner earned his B.A. and
M.A. degrees at Ohio State Uni-

versity, and later his Ph.D. at Pitt‘. ‘

in 1949. Presently a resident of

Ben Avon, Dr. Masoner is the
father of three children. The
eldest Paul, Jr., is a college soph-
omore.

‘Aftpr a day's work, Dr. Mas-
oner readily admits that little
time remains for his favorite
pastime, reading mystery stor-
ies. This matters very little.
since Dr. Masoner ﬁrmly be-
lieves that the best way to kill

‘ time is to work it to death.

Reading Ability

PARKVIDLE, Mo. (IP)—“Im-
provement of Reading Week,” an

innovation during opening school-

_week at Park College this year for
all freshman and transfer students,
featured a required reading test
and ﬁlms and lectures on improve-
ment of reading skills.

A reading laboratory is con-

‘ducted for those whose perform-

ance on the test proved them un”-
qualiﬁed to cover the‘ amount of
1' e a d in g required in 5 college

courses. During the school year a
student attends sessions in the lab-

" oratory and has his reading rate

and comprehension speeded up
through the use of special reading
ﬁlms, reading _ accelerators and
other mechanical devices.

Heiress Different
From Usual Work

Pitt Players admit they are
excited about their new pro-
duction, “The Heiress,” which
will be presented in Stephen
Foster Memorial Dec. 11, 12
and 13. The play is completely
diﬁerent from anything the Play-
ers have tried before, and even

‘Harvey Pope, the director, con-

fesses that he is enthusiastic
about it.

A psychological drama, the play
has in the leads two new students,
Juan Cliff O’Callahan as Dr. Slop-
er and Shelia Elias as his shy
daughter Catherine. Other mem-
bers of the cast are Marie Hren
as Marian Almond, Nancy Ryland
as Mrs. Montgomery, Paul Hur-
ley as Arthur Townsend, Patty
Goldberg as Elizabeth Almond,
Bonnie Lee,Ch.arlton as Maria, the
maid, Anna Lou Alex as the heir-
ess’ Aunt Lavcinia and John Wall-
hausser as Morris Townsend.

“The Heiress,” which ran suc-
cessfully on Broadway and as a
movie, is the Players’ second at-
tempt of the year.

At Du Pont, men ‘with "many types of training trans-
late laboratory developments into full-scale production

 

Roger Jones, B.S. in Chem., Haverford College ’52 (right), and operator
check temperature control in the conversion of furfural to furan.

7 Among the most interesting ﬁelds for

engineers at Du Pont is the design of
plants and equipment.

It takes ingenuity of a high order
to translate a small-scale laboratory

foperation into all-out commerical
production. Design engineers cannot

always use purchasable equipment
to scale up research ﬁndings, even
with considerable adaption. About
half of the time at Du Pont, entirely
new equipment must be designed be-
cause of the novelty of the process
developed by research.

For example, a number of unusual
problemswere involved in designing
the equipment and plant for a process
in which hexamethylenediamine, one
of the intermediates, for nylon, is
made from furfural, derived from

_ such’ agricultural by-products as
 and ,  f__ of; Tcottonseed

In this conversion, these steps are in-
volved: " ' '

C4H3OCHO ”°°' , clmo
furfural catalyst furan
2H2 C4H8O
3 tetmhydrofurun
ZHC‘ c1(cH2)4‘c1
) ‘ dichlorobutano
2N°CN NClCH2l4 CN
' adiponifrile
4H2 \ H2N(CH2)6 NH2
) hexamethylenediamine

Here are some of the special problems that
were encountered:

‘I. Design of equipment with close
temperature control for converting fur-

fural to furan. The design ﬁnally settled

on employs a large number of tubes con- ’
 a catalyst, with a coolant circu-.. _

Med"   ., .

‘ Special

    

Scale model of a part of the plant where adi- ’
ponitrile is made from furfural.

timers were devised for operation of the
valves controlling production and re-

’ generation cycles.

2. Design of high-pressure agitated
autoclaves for the hydrogenation of
furan to tetrahydrofuran.

3. Selection of corrosion-resistant 1
equipment for the hydrochlorination of
tetrahydrofuran to dichlorobutane/at!

high temperatures.

4. Design of a unique ﬁve—step distil- -
lation train to obtain high-grade adi-
ponitrile without trace impurities.

Although most of these problems
involve a great deal of chemical en-
gineering, also needed on the design-
ing team were mechanical, electrical,
civil, metallurgical and industrial en-
gineers. Thus design work at Du Pont,
is open to men with many types of
training, and there is abundant op-
portunity for all.

For Unfair Tactics

— Lest I forget to do so later on, allow me at this point
to thank Mr. Green for placing my name in his column. .-
As a former undergrad at Pitt for four years, I realize that I

the distinction of being referred to in the Pitt News after

graduation is a very rare on
indeed. . ~
Just -what it is your reporter
is attempting to prove in his
column, “Progress or Patronage
for M.C.?” in the Friday, Nov. 14
Is it that
Pitt’s student governing bodies
indulge in politics? "Or that
groups of fraternities tend _to
work‘ together and favor each
other? Or that certain students
are disliked by others? No-—-I
don’t think so! I hardly think
that even Mr. Green would take
the time and space to convey
thoughts known to just about
every undergrad at any college in
the land. _ ’
’ Rather, it seems to me that Mr.
Green has very cleverly taken
advantage of his position on the

' Pitt News to accomplish the very-
_same thing he pretends toblast

in his column--unfair favoritism.
What right, has any reporter on
the one and only school news-

4 paper to declare that this boy,

“fa_r outshines the qualiﬁcations,”
of the opponents? Just who does
Mr..Green imagine himself to be
-Walter Lippmann, Stewart‘ Al-
sop, or Drew Pearson? It occurs
to me that for a man who has
never been iii student govern-
ment, this reporter certainly
takes great liberty in setting him-
self up as an authority on student
leaders.

As to references made to the
“Wecht machine,” let me assure
you that my correspondence with
present members of Pitt’s student
body includes no weekly orders
on how to run the school. If I
chose to dislike and/or “cut”
anyone when I was at Pitt, I can
only hope to justifymy actions
on the basis of my having beenea
politician, or, if Mr. Green ‘pre-

' fers, “a political glad hander.”

But please, Mr. Editor, person-
alities aside, don’t let your ﬁne
newspaper become another New
York Daily News or Chicago
Herald Tribune by publishing a
completely biased story, loaded
with half—truths, based on erron-

_ eous -and grossly misconceived

assumptions, and written by a
student who most obviously still
carries grudges in remembrance
of thedefeat he and his bosom
buddy received in the spring
elections at the hands of the so-

called “Wecht machine!”

Top vote getter on the offensive

Carl.son’s Veteraii-Studded Cagers   
Expected To Better 1951-52 Record

By RUSS FRANKE , _
With virtually the same
team returning from last sea-
son, Dr. H. C. Carlson and
his“ cagers embark on the
’1952—53 schedule Saturday
with experience as their‘ main as-
set. .

Right now the Panthers have»
a month of practice behind them,
and will travel to Ann Arbor,
Mich., to take on the Wolverines
before returning to host West-
minster. Tuesday, Dec. 9 at. the
Field House in’ the home opener.

A host of veterans with ﬁrst
and second string game experi-
ence strongly indicate a better
team than last year, when the
Panthers won ten and last twelve
with Mickey Zernich and Clar-‘~
ence “Dutch” Burch expected to
lead, the way in scoring again.

Mickey Top Scorer
Besides Zernich and Burch,
Carlson will probably go along
with Art Boyd, Don Virostek and

Dick Deitrick, Jim McClure and
Chet Palesko as relief men. ‘, »
S Last yearzernich, at forward,
led in scoring with 334 points, fol-
lowed by Burch with 225, Virostek

That Stuff in the Ballot
Box Ain't Hay

Once there was a Senior who
faced a Financial Impasse.
He was, in 9. word, Broke-—
due to heavy extra-curricular
Operating Expenses. He was
discussing with his room-
mate ways and means of
climbing‘ hack Aboard the
Gold Standard. “Simple,”
_ said the roommate, “just tap
the Male Parent for an Ad-
vance.” “Don’t be Dull,” answered Our Hero,
“I’m already four months ahead on my sl-
lowance. And besides, the Head of the Clan
is in a Grim Mood. He Dropped 8. Bundle on
the election results.” “Oh-ho," said his side-
kick, “listen. . . .” Out Boy listened. Twenty
minutes later he steamed into the Western
Union ollice, his brain-cells bulging with
Strategy, and dispatched a vital message. To
wit: “Dear Dad—-Went broke backing Steven-
son. Know you’ll understand. Like father, like
son. Please wire me ﬁfty, Urgent. Love.”

The cash arrived within the hour. By West-
ern Union money order. Our Boy is now
working for 8. Practical Cause——campaigning
for presidential elections every year instead
of every four.

The moral? Simply this——-when you’re Pro-'
specting for Pesos, there’s no more productive
probe than n Telegram. Saves time, saves weal:
and tear, saves answering embarrassing ques-
tions. Try it.--and don’: overlook Telegrams

A full-scale scrimmage
held Monday with Duquesne’s
Dukes at the Field House, and by
this time Carlson is fairly certain
of which players have earned a
berth on the team. He termed last
Sat.urday’s exhibition game against
Akron Goodyears “quite satisfac-
tory.” O

The Goodyears, a top-ﬂight am-
ateur outﬁt, found Pitt ahead at
the three—quarter mark but man-
aged to breeze ahead later and
win, 84-65.

"I always smoked Chesterfields in college iustlike
my Friends", says New York secretary, Elizabeth‘
Lydon, "and here in New.York it seems like almost

everyone smokes them."

‘  Tﬂidau DUKE '51

 

A responsible consulting organization reports a study by a
competent medical specialist and staff on the effects of smoking
Chesterfields. For six months a group of men and women

T smoked only Chesterfield—1O to 40 a. day—their normal amount.
45 percent of the group have smoked Chestérfields from one to
thirty years for an average of ten years each.

At the beginning and end of the six-months, each smoker was
given a thorough examination including X-rays, and covering
the sinuses,‘ nose, ears and throat. After these examinations,
the medical specialist stated . . .

“It is my opinion that the ears, nose, throat and acces-
sory organs of all participating subiecfs examined by me .
were not adversely affected in the six-months period by
smoking the cigarettes provided."

Remember this report and buy Chesterfields . . . regular or-
king-size. ’
