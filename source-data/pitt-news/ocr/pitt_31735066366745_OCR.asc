Soldier’s Essay

Relays Commitment
Editor, The Pitt News:

The following is the prize win-
ning essay written by a soldier
, enroute to Vietnam to join the
Allied Forces in the war against
the Communists of North Viet-
nam.

_ The contest was conducted
aboard a Navy transport taking
’2,000 American soldiers to the
war zone. The author of the arti-
cle is Second Lieutenant Arthur
Ruff. My brother, Ensign Robert
Codori, who is serving aboard the
transport, sent this essay to me
V and in his letter said, “Lt. Ruff
echoes my own thoughts.”

The essay follows in full:
“Why I am ﬁghting in Vietnam
would really not be the proper
question for me to try to answer,
to explain my presence in that
country. The question for me to
try to answer instead would be:
‘-‘What right do I have not to ﬁght
in Vietnam?’ By this I mean,
could I as a freedom-loving Amer-
_ican think of any valid reason
why I should not be willing to
‘risk my life to preserve that
freedom?

“Since“I was a small child, I
have lived in the richest and
most democratic nation the world

has ever known. I grew with the
certain knowledge that my own
personal fortune would be limit-
ed only by my ability and ambi-
tion. My religion was my own,

freely chosen; my ideas were my *

ow'n, freely discussed; my"’friend-
ships were my own, freely cul-
tivated. As a child these things
were taken for granted.

“As I grew older, though, I
realized that all the world was
not as rich or free as my. nation
was, I also realized that this
wealth and freedom did not come
about A my accident. Neither did

it come about through diplomatic

maneuvering. The wealth came
from ambition and hard work.
The freedom started from an
idea. To make that idea a reality
required the blood of thousands
of men almost 200 years ago.
“Since that time in 1776 many
attempts have been made to erase
that idea from the page of his-
tory. Each time in an attempt
was made, diplomats tried to rea-
son a solution. In most cases they
failed. In the ﬁnal analysis, .the
price that had to be paid to re-
tain freedom was always the
same-—human blood—the lives of
dedicated men rea.dy to risk
everything in order that a na-
tion such as our should not per-

Honoraries --
University honoraries, possess _static, unimaginative programming-
‘:? Most have a typical calendar of activities encompassing elections, tapping
I sessions, and an occassional luncheon, tea, or dinner. They rarely present
‘fa critical analysis to the student body of a University or student issue.-
, Honoraries supposedly select campus leaders—-people who can mam-
tain a balance between a good academic record and significant leadership
in extra-curricular activities. Once such people are tapped into an honorary
 their talents should not remain passive.
A -— They should be mobilized as an action group by giving critical evalua-
: tion of University and student problems and sponsoring programs on‘stu-
 dent, national, and international issues for the entire student body.
For example, a symposium on Civil Rights, Vietnam, or the Role of
Student Organizations would be a worthwhile endeavor for an honorary.
I Not only could one honorary sponsor such an activity, but a men’s and
_. women’s honorary might provide joint-sponsorship. \
‘A Only one such program was attempted this year when Quax and
Mortar Board sponsored a discussion on “Women and Careers.” These types
 of programs expose students, faculty, and administrators to one another
in an informal atmosphere—-+one which is often more conducive to the ex-

tition. Dormitory, fraternity, sorority, and campus organizations would
have teams ‘participating in a round-robin tournament dealing with all
ﬁelds of the liberal arts. Prizes might be donated by local groups or by a
consolidation of monies from various groups.

Another improvement in programming involves taking the men’s" and
women’s honoraries out of isolation. Cwens, Thyrsa Amos Society, and
Mortar Board parallel the men’s Phi Eta Sigma, Druids, and ODK+they

utilized.

“Today, we are faced with a
new attempt to crush freedom.
The name of this is Communism.
Make no mistake, this menace
has sworn to bury us. Should I
then rely on diplomats to appease
this scourge? Do I have the
right to sit idly by and let some-
one bully me out of the heritage
bought for me with the lives of
countless thousands? Do I have
the right to appease these inter-
national gangsters in the hope
that I will not have to ﬁght to-
day, but that my son will ﬁght
for me tomorrow? What reasons
do I give God for not defending
everything that I hold sacred? Do
I have the right to tell Him I
was afraid? Fear is no excuse
for cowardice. Do I have the
right to tell Him that I didn't
think war was the right thing?
Not when the blood of innocent
victims still runs in the villages
and towns of Vietnam where
they were murdered.

“Why then am I ﬁghting in
Vietnam? I have no right not to
be.”

For instance, ODK and Mortar Board might sponsor monthly.“bull
“sessions” where group members would discuss some significant University
or national problem. Guest faculty, administrators, or community leaders
might be asked to such sessions. These would not only let the leaders of
the respective sexes mix mentally, but‘ provide the honoraries with an
active program—-a sense of intellectual purpose.

Honoraries are groups which “honor” the best students in the liberal
arts tradition. These students serve as a repository for campus leadership,
having valuable opinions and ﬁne qualities of leadership, having valuable
opinions and fine qualities of leadership. Such talents should not only bene-
ﬁt the honorary, but the entire student body.

The present stature of honoraries merely recognizes these talents,
but does not perpetuate them. We feel that activism of honorary programs
would insure the maintenance and use of recognized campus leadership.
We urge that these people not merely be recognized, but-their talents

q The Art of Guitar

Lesson One

Although the folk music craze seems to be on the wane
the guitar fad is not, as the sore ﬁngers of youth and the
swelling wallets of the musical instrument barons can testi-
fy. Guitar factories work overtime -and still fail to meet the
demand. And every week hundreds more decide to become
part-time strummers.

Naturally the demand for guitar teachers is enormous
and their fees reflect it. Thus many new guitar owners ﬁnd
that they are unable to acquire the basic
skills .without investing a great deal of
money. ‘To remedy this situation I, as an
ardent guitar fan, have relinquished my
space this Week to give a brief instruction
in basic guitar terminology and technique.

The two maineparts of the guitar are
 the fat part and the skinny part. , e skin-
- ny part, or neck, is*held firmly in the left
‘ ‘ V hand. This is known as choking. The fat

CIKOSKI part,-or. body, is «placed across the lap with
the right hand resting over the central opening, or hole, as
though stifling a yawn. Thus seated and facing the audi-
ence, or clods, the player is ready to begin making music.

 

At this point the player should notice the strings, run- _

ning the length of the instrument, which appear to be in the
way. They’re not and if you have cut them off as such you
should immediately replace them, unless you have already

' mastered the advanced technique of “faking.” Barring this,

the player places the ﬁnger tips of his left hand each upon

. one of the strings in a ‘random fashion. The position of the

ﬁngers in relation to the subdivisions of the neck is not im-
portant for these have only been added to produce the illu-
sion of difficulty for the clods. .

The ﬁngers of the right hand are then made to vibrate

. and tremble, dart hither and yon and generally make fools

of themselves over the’ hole. This is the basic “strum” and 

the sounds which issue from the instrument are termed
“music.”

To vary the music, as indeed it should be although not
necessarily a must, the ﬁngers of the left hand are moved
about on the strings, up and down the neck. To amuse him-
self While playing the musician may wish to pretend that

. his ﬁngers are little legs and that they are walking and

‘Waltzing on a long black sidewalk, sometimes even playing

a little game of hopscotch or step on a crack, break your
mother’s back.

Once the new "guitar owner has mastered the techniques

and terms presented here he can count himself a true mem-

ber of the musical community. He will be invited to parties
where he can impress and amaze his friends. He c\an-learn‘
advanced technique. He may even become a star- But best
of all he will learn that even an artist can be popular.

lor Dr. David Kurtzman on “The
Student and the State” Thursday
at 3 p.m. in the Student Union
Lower Lounge. The talk will also
be presented in conjunction with
Associated Women Students, In-

change in the trimester system.
Dr. Kurtzman will answer ques-
tions from the audience and will
also make an opening statement
on the University and its develop-
ment.

Dr. Kurtzman, a former state
cabinet officer with a career in
public ﬁnance, came to the Uni-
versity last July at the height of
ﬁnancial difficulties. He was ap-
pointed acting chancellor last
month when the late Acting
Chancellor Stanton C. Crawford‘
suffered a fatal heart attack. Dr.
Kurtzman has been working in
conjunction with the Trustees to
work out a satisfactory state re-

Early Payment Date
ForDormitoryDeposit
To Aid Upperclassmen

The deadline for payment

housing was moved up so
that upperclass students who

desire to live in the dormi-
tories would be guaranteed at
room, said Vice-Chancellor for
Student Affairs Helen P. Rush.
Both men and women must pay
their $100 non-refundable depos-
it by April 1 instead of in the
summer as in previous years.

One the number of upperclass-
men desiring dormitory space is
known the University will be
able to know how many fresh-
men and transfer students to ac-
cept for residency in the dormi-
tories, she said. Since the num-
ber of new students admitted is
controllable, the new policy will
insure those students presently
enrolled at the University ﬁrst
choice of available campus hous-
ing.

Miss Rush admitted that the
new policy could inconvenience
students but that “either way
we're trapped. A student might
not get off-campus housing and‘
then ﬁnd the dorms are ﬁlled
with freshmen.”

VICE CHANCELIDR RUSH
Explains Housing Change

To help alleviate the housing
shortage, the. University will hire
a housing coordinator to help
students ﬁnd oﬂf-campus housing.
The co-ordinator will ﬁnd what
is available, inspect the places
and make a card ﬁle on them.

He will be a full time employee,
Miss Bush said, and will “handle
problems between students and
landlords.” About a half dozen
people have been interviewed by
Miss Rush for the job but no one
has been hired.

Many landlords do not at this
time know what housing will be
available in September, Vice-
Chancellor Rush said in explan-
ing why the co-ordinator has not
yet been hired.

, Cager n Analysis

, _ By JAY ROSENSTEIN
Panther coach Bob Timmons had a lot
to say at the basketball luncheon Monday

.~.1«<. -

‘afternoon. Unfortunately, with a 5-17 rec-
rd‘ there wasn’t much enthusiasm in his
analysis of the season.

;- The prime topic, of course was the
‘I cum of injuries suffered by the squad. “This is
evﬁrst year in.my 30 years of coaching,” Tim-.
ns said, “where I’ve had so many ﬁrst string
Juries. We lost-Bollens, Falenski, and then Lovett.

“That not only hurt our offense,” he continued,
it forced us to change our defense too. We had
I use a zone and combination defenses when play-.
rs like Bollens couldn’t run.”
‘The Panthers started the season in a man for
_n type defense. They’use.d it until the first Penn
"State game and it worked well. But once. the in-
 Juries piled up-' and Timmons had to resort to other
A‘ ijdefenses, they registered only one more victory
_; "for the rest of the year.
 j That win was over Carnegie Tech, also beaten
 the Panthers in the season opener. Other vic-
j _ ious moments came against George Washington

9 in the Steel Bowl, Rochester in the Kodak Classic,
nd Westminster at Fitzgerald Field House.
, - .According to Timmons, the worst games were

‘;,the last two. “We ran into red hot ball clubs in
Westminster and Penn State,” he said. “I think
"that State played their best game against us.”
' The Panthers, met other teams in addition to
.enn State that are headed for the NIT. St. John's.
irginia Tech, and Temple all have received bids.
They all defeated the Panthers. Syracuse did too
"and. they will play in the'NCAA tournament.
The /rough schedule, as Timmons pointed out,
1 gave Jim LaValley a chance to gain experience
_;frorri someof the East’s best big men. Perhaps La-
alley made some of the high points of the season
 or Panther fans when he stuffed Sonny Dove, Jim
*-Williams, and Carver Clinton.

{_‘‘He gives it everything he has,” Timmons said.
monly sorry that he had to learn things the hard
way, underneath the basket.”

 

1 - Lavalleyz ﬁgures in Timmons’ plans for next
, year.-He, along with Stan Falenski and Ken Bol-
';-leris (when healthy) have started this season.
ince co-captains Larry Szykowny and Bob Lovett '
raduate, Tirnmons sees at least one forward spot
nd one backcourt position open.

_ “With the freshmen coming up, and our cur-
ent sophomores and juniors returning,” Timmons
ted, ‘‘we’ll have reserve strength that we haven’t

_ d for three years. I’ll haveveight or nine bal1- '
layers that can deliver.”

Gaze Past Tourney
Into Hopeful Future

By TOM SACKS, Assistant Sports Editor

The climax of the Eastern wrestling
season, the EIWA tournament, is coming
up in roughly a week and a half. But despite
the fact that it's going to be held at the
field house, it doesn't promise to be much

of a climax for Dave J ohnson’s wrestlers.
The sophomer dominated wrestling team closed
out its dual meet season last Saturday with Penn

‘ State on a losing note, 22-10. Considering the fact

that only three years ago the wrestlers were
spoken of as a major powerhouse in the East, this
year’s record of 2-7 is doubly depressing. _

The Eastern tourney doesn’t promise to pro-
vide any relief. “Facing the facts,” said Johnson,
‘‘we’ll be lucky to place as high as sixth or sev-
enth. -With Dino Boni injured I can’t think of any
potential winners. '

Despite the disappointments of this season, and
there have been" quite a few, Johnson has still
kept his hopes high. On the surface, thepoor rec-
ord doesn’t promise much. But underneath, each
meet provided the wrestlers with all important
experience that they will be able to“ capitalize
on next year. ,

“With a little bit of luck in recruiting W
should be back» near the top in the East,” pro-
phesized Johnson. - -

Two people Johnson will be especially looking
forward to are freshmen Billy Welker (123) and
Larry Cuba (130). This still leaves the upper-mid-
dle weights in needy condition.

And that's where Johnson plans to concentrate
most of his efforts in his recruiting tour next

month. Johnson, in his ﬁrst year here, has already 2

sent out letters to all of his friends inthe tri-state
area in search of tips. Later on he plans to spend
about a week personally combing the area.
“I've developed a lot of friends among the high
school coaches in this area and I'm pretty conﬁ-
dent that they're going to come through for me,"
said Johnson- ' -
Among those already. on the team that might
provide some points for Johnson in next. week's

' Easterns are Ron Schuchert and Jack Williams.

Schuchert has cruised through the season with a
6-3 record. If Williams can get his arm back in top
shape, his performance in the tournament might
surprise a lot of people. -

Withthe exception of Boni, Schuchert and Wil-
liams are the only wrestlers that have posted a
winning record this season. Dick Shildt is 4-4-1;
Terry Hoover, 4A-1; and Clair Riley, 3-4-2. Randy
Kahler and Jim Rhone have each posted two vic-
tories. Among the remaining matmen—-Tony Lib-
erati, Cliff Zolikoﬁ, A1 Traunsteiner and Tim
Trax-—only three victories were recorded.

By ROY JACOBS

To most basketball players
the role of sixth man ranks
along with that of a brides-
maid at a wedding. Yet, a
good sixth man is essential
to “every good team, a fact
demonstrated by John Havlicck
ol' the Boston Celtics and Kenny
Washington of UCLA.

And, as the freshman basket-
ball season rolled on, Tim Fisher
was faced with the same role. He
is destined to make the same con-
tribution on the varsity next
_year. That doesn't mean he has
to like it, t.hou_g‘h.

‘‘I’d rather play the whole
game. and I think Iican play the
whole game." says Tim. “It just
seems I do better when I come
in like that. It's not that I'm
trying harder, it just goes that
way."

Fishcr’s play didn't just go that
way. His insertion into the line-
up sparked several freshman vic-
tories, notably against Point Park
when he scored the last four
points in a one-point victory, and
against Duquesne when his four
points in the last two minutes
sent the game into overtime in
an eventual Cub victory. Yet,
Tim’s performance doesn’t agree
with his outlook.

“I have more trouble getting
warmed up. It takes a while to
get adjusted. It was easier when
I started. Then everybody was in
the same situation.”

The biggest adjustment for Tim
was defense. In high school, Steel-
ton played a combination zone
and man-to-man, and Tim wasn't
forced to work hard. This year,
the freshmen used a man—to-man
exclusively and he had a hard
time adjusting.

“In the beginning of the year,
I was just standing there. I've
improved, but there’s still a long
way to go.” i

“I shot better when I was a
junior. When I moved to guard
last year, I didn’t get as many
shots but handled the ball more.
I definitely think I’m a guard,
but I may not be fast enough.
The teams we’re going to play
now have big forwards. It would
be hard to work against them.”
Still, Tim ﬁnished the season as
A1 DiFrischia’s replacement at

- center.

Fischer’s coach, Tim Grgurich,
likened him to former Panther
star Dave Sauer who came off
the bench frequently as a. sopho-

more and junior to spark varsity
rallies. Saucr started as a senior.

“Tim's improved tremendously
on his bad habits," said Grgurich.
“Coming oil the bench is tough
to do. It's easy to start. The

coaches thought he did a good
job and he'll probably have the
year."

/

While Grgurich was talking
about Fishcr’s improvement, he
brought up the matter of the
rest of the freshman team. The
Cubs posted a 12-5 record. and
only a late season slump kept it
from being‘ better.

“Each one of them improved
something individually, With
some it was just little things.

But they all learned to be a
team. They're gonna go a long
way. They’ve got a lot going for
them that a lot of other teams
haven't had.”

The high point of the season‘
was the Cubs‘ eight-game win-
ning streak, including victories
over Duquesne and West Vir-
ginia, a feat that hasn‘t been ac-
complished since the freshman
clay of Brian Generalovich and
Calvin Sheffield. That speaks for
itself.

Engineers and Scientists:

Let's talk about a career at Boeing...
50-year leader in aerospace technology

Campus Interviews, Wednesday through Friday. March 9 through 11

The most effective way to evaluate a com-
pany in terms of its potential for dynamic
career growth is to examine its past rec-
ord, its current status, and its prospects
and planning for the future, together with
the professional climate it offers for the
development of your individual capabilities.

Boeing, which in 1966 completes 50 years
of unmatched aircraft innovation and pro-
duction, offers you career opportunities as
diverse as its extensive and varied back-
log. Whether your interests lie in the ﬁeld
of commercial jet airliners of the future or
in space-ﬂight technology, you can ﬁnd at
Boeing an opening which combines profes-
sional challenge and long-range stability.
The men of Boeing are today pioneering
evolutionary advances in both civilian and
military aircraft, as well as in space pro-
grams of such historic importance as
America's ﬁrst. moon landing. Missiles,
space vehicles, gas turbine engines, trans-
port helicopters, marine vehicles and basic
research are other areas of Boeing activity.

There's a spot where your talents can‘
mature and grow at Boeing, in research,
design, test, manufacturing or administra-
tion. The company's position as world
leader in jet transportation provides a
measure of the calibre of people with
whom you would work. In addition, Boeing
people work in small groups, where initia-
tive and ability get maximum exposure.
Boeing encourages participation in the
company-paid Graduate Study Program at
leading colleges and universities near
company installations.

We're looking forward to meeting engi-
neering, mathematics and science seniors
and graduate students during our visit to
your campus. Make an appointment now
at your placement office. Boeing is an
equal opportunity employer.
