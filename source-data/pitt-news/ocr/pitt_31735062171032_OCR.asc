‘Before discussing unions as
they relate to social change. Pow-

Powell went on to explain that

there are over 82 million people

who work in the US and only ap-
proximately l9 million belong to
unions—l3 of which are affiliated
with the parent body AFL-CIO.
“This leaves over 63 million who
do not belong to unions because
many companies try to make sure
workers do not become union-
ized.”

Powell maintained the second
function was political action.
"Most unions are more political
than the Republican and Demo-
cratic parties and if you don't be-
lieve me just look at their meet-
ings around election time."
said.

Research and education was the
third function that Powell em-
phasized. He pointed out "many
companies do not have education

‘departments. "

He cited community action and
development as the fourth func-
tion. “Most unions are merely
concerned about workers’ wages,
hours, and working conditions,

munity and the University lev-
el."

Speaking to a predominantly fe-
male group at the University and
City Ministries (UACM), Camp-
bell was “very concerned" about
making the feminist organization
a respected one.

She pointed to the work being
done on two of the'Oakland .\O\\ ‘s
task forces: education and rape.

"in the education task force.
we'll probably decide to talk to
parents. teachers. and children
to let them know that they don't-
have to play sex roles. which. for
example. are brought out in the
popular Dick and Jane books used
in primary school." said Camp-
bell.

She added that the task force
will “probably concentrate on
dealing directly with people in
letting them know about all forms
of sex discrimination rather than
relying on the distribution of lit-
erature and pamphlets.”

Carroll said public schools have
been guilty of perpetuating the
traditional roles of women in so-

Unions -Relate 7 to Change

(Continued from Page 2) L

Powell emphasized ‘that unions
have problems often obstructing
their operations. such as "youth
vs. age." As an example. he
noted. the average steelworker is
only 28 years old and said it is
difficult to form"contracts which
meet the aspirations of all ll1V0l\'-.
ed because of this fact.

[he "no roots" problem can be
seen in the fact that people are no
longer tied to the community".
Powell explained. and this causes
additional problems. He maintain-
ed that current means of trans-
portation cause a lack of coin-
munication among. not only work-
ers.- but people in general. he
noted that people even have their
own recreational facilities now.
causing further communication
gaps and isolation.

A fourth problem, Powell noted
was what he termed the “human-
izational”

more human. Workers don’t want
to do any more than necessary
when dissatisfied.” To illustrate
his point, he cited the case of the
garbage man who was given the
title of “sanitary engineer” and
a whole new image.

Thurs., May 3rd

becoming

Turning to the core of his lec-
ture.-Powell said that cities are
"dens of inequity’—
businesses and people are mov-

* ing out into the suburbs. He noted

that housing is fast becoming a
pressing crisis. and though these
developments are occurring. the
unions are not speaking out.

How can change occur'.’ Powell
suggested a start "may be at ttie
union meeting" which now ‘sut-
fers from lack of attendance.

‘Powell concluded, “Unions re-
flect the attitudes of society. At-
titudes on the job are brought
home. Unions have a responsibil-
ity, not only to their member-
ship, but also the community.”

News in Summary

Compiled from
the Associated Press
by KAREN BURGIO
President Nixon is being strong-
ly urged by White House aides
just below the top level to sweep
out all those involved in the
Itatergage scandal. according to
a staff source.

Sen. Charles ’Percy,'R-Ill., an-
nounced that he introducted a res-
olution yesterday calling on Nixon
to take the case out of the hands
of his appointees in the Justice
Department and to replace it
with a politically independent
special prosecutor or irreproach-
able reputation and “impeccable”
integrity. ’

Percy said. however. that he
hopes t\ixon will seize the initia-
tive by making a full statement on

,the case and by firing all those

members of his staff who have
lost public confidence.

Vice President Spiro Agnew
said Sunday that if he goes into
the 1976 presidential race. "1 11
run to win. and I can win."

“The fact that I have been in a
fairly "constant position with a
broad cross-section of the public

The last time we were gathered here I prom-
ised to go on with my intemerate views of Liber-
ation. Actually, I’ had endorsed most of the real
aims of Women’s Lib, but I did take a moment to
chucklein a rather nasty manner about some of the
more obvious idiocies being committed in the name
of an otherwise worthwhile movement. I am still‘
pleased about having been nasty. but it is time to
go on. , '

(If you ever have to write a column, never
make promises for the -future." I could be crowing
over Watergate just like everybody else if if it

" ’weren’t for this.) .

The text for today’s.sermon is as follows:
“_Child-rearing and’ Housework Are Demeaning.” -

Thisis not the time for any‘ person to stand up

, and announce that he or she. never said any such

thing. You did not have to ;" it was said over and over
in your behalf, and you never jumped_up to correct

_ ,the3speakers.Si-t down. _ .

‘I’ have "never thought housework‘ was demean- _
. ing. In _my youth, which is past, I washed a great
_many‘ d_ishes,_,a_'nd hated every minute of it. It was,

hard. dirty.work, and it didn‘t pay} well at all. but it

"only made me tired, not demeaned._I have scrub-
bed the-oc-casional floor, and it made me sweaty

and angry,.bu_t notdemeaned. . b _ .

I have fixed dinner after a day of work, but I
enjoyed the job and generally found the food even
better for the effort that went into it.

’‘ Sofar this is a stanard bit of bullshit from ad

dilettante. _a‘-man who goes into the kitchen every» -

couple of months, leaves a spectacularmess for V

V someone else (female) to clean up, and announces

that cooking isn't such a bad deal after all. ‘

I have met dozens of them, and" might have’ been
one of them at one time, butnow Ihave improved
my credentials-., ‘ A ' .

We are three. My roommate and I were trying
to be coy when we made announcement, and I think

we succeeded.’ The information involved is true,'.

though. By our mutual efforts we have produced a
very small .human_be‘ing. This is nice, but'not.in-

teresting. We are not the only-fertile people in the’ '
I world’; thetrick‘ of reproduction has been done he-
". fore. " ‘ ' ' l '

 . Now‘ the‘ small differences begin. I am a stu-
dent. or. I would _not be‘ writing here..Students are

notoriously poor." Nobody -‘who had a choice would 
I pick a student__fora parent. Fortunately’ there is a I
_ breadwinner in the family. ' I 

Corry is a nurse. She is a nurse-with _a ven-_
geance. She studied nuifsingin Europe, and isregis-
‘tered there.‘ Whe'n~she came to-Pennsylvania..she'
went through the whole mesh _of bureaucratic non-

sense and managed to get her certificate as a reg-
xisteredrnurse her_e.:She can support us-all, the ‘baby.

the' calico cat and me, but there isa catch, She

.4 has to go’ to_ work.

‘It isn’t easy, but I have managedto have my

I" schedule at ‘Pitt match up to her work schedule. I

finish‘ classes just in time to pick her up and take
her to work. She brings Bozo (a fine name for an in-

,fa'nt)' tolthe bus, and we go to the hospital. After

that, Bozo and I are onour own. _
He doesn’tmii_id', and I kind of enjoy it.
4- Corry leaves bottlesof her own milk for Bozo‘.

_in t’he~fridge. Bozo sleeps for awhile, and wakes up

hijrigry in the middle of the news. For his supper. I
mash up a banana with a ‘little’ Turbinado sugar.

Then I spoon it“ into him. This is not always easy 5
E with a person who is only ’eight"weeks.old; he is in-

clined to stare at things across the room instead of‘
paying attention to-his spoonful. When his face is

. turned to‘-the side, the mashed bananaruns, out of
‘his, mouth. towards his shoulder. If I catch it in‘

time: I shovel it back into his mouth.-He‘doe'sn‘t
mi-nd.‘ ' 7 ’ . ‘

' If I mi_ss~, it’s' gone, and I don’t, mind. _

Bozo also needs fresh trousers pretty often. He
has just learned to recognize a wet diaper. and he
does itevery chance he gets. Nobody else seems
to be home, so I perform the service. —

All of this sounds like a lot of work, and it is.
But it is not a full-time job. Bozo needs about six
hours of attention every day, and the six hours are
spread out evenly among the twenty-four hours of
the average day. But in between he sleeps, or at
least does‘ not sing too loud. I'get a‘ lot of free

‘ time, and I still get credit for watching him for

nine hours or so. Notabad deal.‘ . ' g
I’ cook and wash the dishes on days when

Corry works, too. Since I know the dishes are

mine. I cook very carefully-,' using as few pots

and spoons as possible. Again. it is almost noth-
ing. and- I enjoy having

a. meal ready when she
comes home. - - '

Still, there is a lot. of time left over. and I

don‘t feel even'a'little'l bit demeaned. If it were. I
‘somebody 'else's_monstrous offspring.‘ I would ‘feel I

more than a little putupon, but Bozo is ours. I ,'

pass’ the debt ._along. My_ parents raisedme. and

_ Bozo inheritsthe obligation of raising some strang-

er when histurn‘ comes. - "
_ 7For instance_,_I havejtime to write" this non-
sence. ’ " ' » °
This has gone on long enough. It is not sup‘-
posed‘ to be an autobiography, just‘ a column. I
think the point has been made; housekeeping and
child-rearing are not demeaning. They are hard
work, and poorly paid, but they are not demean-

ing. If it is your ‘own house andyour own child. -

the work brings more“ pleasure than fatigue. ,

A Watergate Water Under The Gate

by MILLIE HENRY

I was afraid for a lo'ng time
that the Watergate was going to
just go away and none of the peo-
ple involved was going to be incon-
venienced. by the whole mess.
Last week showed that that wasn't

_ going to happen. While we were

watching live and in color on the
news on all the networks the bur-
glars were being caught, even the
ones who were disguised as Cabi-
net officers or private servants

1 I’ of the President himself.

6 .

Back when it still looked like

all of Nixon’s friends were going .

to get away clean I thought it
would be a good idea to make a
symbolic protest and send a copy
of the. Constitution to the Pres-
ident himself, maybe with some
footnotes to show where his idea
of executive privilege wasn't ex-
actly what was meant to go with
his high office. But then I thought
about it, and it seemed‘ unlikely
that anything as_radical as the
Constitution would ever get
through the screen of bureaucrats
who protect Nixon from any con-
tact with the peo'p1e‘whom he is
the servant of. Then I thought
that an indirectapproach might
work better, by way of somebody
like the Vice-President. , I

But this was a crisis. There
wasn’t time to wait until the class-
ic comics people came out with
their version of the Constitution.
It looked like I would have to wait
until an honest man turned up
among all the thieves that are
running the country, and that look-
ed like a pretty long time. That
was my mistake. It might be 20
years before an honest man turns
up among N ixon’s friends.

Does it bother you that I keep
talking about an honest "man"?
Instead of an honest person. or an
honest being? ‘

There is a reason. Except for a
few scattered appointments for

"female" things like Consumer.

Protection and a secretary for
Pat. there are only men in the
magic inner circle of Nixon’s
friends. That used to seem unfair.
but now I think I understand why
there weren’t any women among
the closest advisors to the Pres-

ident. There aren't any women’

like Dean and Haldemann and
Mitchell. Maybe it would be im-
possible to find any women like
them. Women aren‘t allowed to

play football in this country. and

maybe that is a good thing. We
don't have that old‘ team spirit.
we aren't willing to do anything.
anything, for the good of the team.

Can’ you imagine a woman At-

torney General standing up ‘in ’

front of the whole Senate, or a
Grand Jury, and denying that she
had broken the law over and over,
even when she knew that she
would get caught in a matter of
time.‘ Can you imaginea woman
taking a risk like that just so the
coach could get elected again?
And knowing that even ‘if the

' coach did get elected again, she

would get caught, and the coach

_would say he didn’t know any-
. thing about it? -

No woman in her right mind
would do such -a thing. No man in
his right mind would either. but
the President seems to know a lot
of men who are not in their right
minds. In fact, that seems to be
the best way to get a job in the
White House. You don't have.to

know how to do anything, you just
have to be ready to do your best

And then the Gipper turns you

loose on your own—but he might
pay your expenses while you‘re

‘in jail. Of course. if he gets caught

at that, the guy that brought the
money goes to jail too. and your
payments get cut off.

Mister Nixon is opposed to
quotoas in hiring. but he seems to
-support what he calls goals. May-

be he ought to set himself a goal

of a few women on his secret
cabinet. Martha Mitchell would
be a good start. At least she al-
ready knows what‘s going on. Or
he might let Pat in on the dirties
of the President business instead
of assigning her to full-time sim-
pering. They might not be the best
women in the world. but they‘d be
smart enough to avoid Water-
gates.

I think I‘m being facetious. but
there‘s a better chance of getting
women into the inner circle than
there is ofmaking any more fun-

It seems like an even bigger
shame when you think about how
many times Nixon has said that
history will prove what kind of a
President he was. He might be a

Small Town Residents Speak Out on Watergate

by PETER ARNETT
AP Special Correspondent

.\'ORTH ARLINGTON, N. J. -
The breakfast regulars at Dannys
Diner on Ridge St. put aside the
sports pages one day last week
and for the first time in the mem-
ory of Mary. the waitress. they
discussed the Watergate affair.

Much of what was mumbled
over the coffee and Danish by the
bleary-eyed clientele was lost to
‘history. But the significance was
not so much -what was said about
Watergate, but that it was dis-

'cussed at all.

North Arlington is a borough of
neat brick houses across the Pas-
saic River from Neward, N. J.
It is predominantly white, middle
class, and propsperous.

The residents have a lot on their

, minds, "like real estate. taxes.

education costs. safety on the

' streets," said Harry Handrack. a

certified public accountant.

They relate personally to events.
“Around here if a neighbor dumps
leaves on his backyard a person
gets more excited than if he hears
the government is falling tomor-
row." laughed Beverly Murphy.

-managing editor of the Weekly
_ North Arlington Leader, only hall

in jest.

A reporter who spent election
day last November in the bor-
ough found it solid Nixon terri-

" - tory. That day the voters shrugged

off" questions about the Water-
gate affair as they went to the
polling places. It was too remote
an issue, too impersonal. I

Today the people of North Ar-

lington have stopped shrugging"

off Watergate and are starting to
face up to its implications. Ev-

"_ eryone contacted during two days

of interviews last week said Wa-
tergate was becoming a ma-jor
topic of conversation.

"I must spend about a third oi
my time with friends discussing
Watergate." said Lois Palaski. a
young housewife with two chil-
dren. "The rest of the time we
talk about the high food prices."

John O'Connell, a freight man-
ager who voted Republican for the
first time last November, said:
_“Watergate is a big issue when
I’m with my friends, and at work.
We’re concerned about it.”

A men‘s clothing store owner.
Philip De Angelis. said his friends
are concerned. “its all these
headlines." he said. "llow can we
possibly ignore them 1""

Brother Clement. the principal
of the Queen of Peace Boys High
School, said Watergate has come
up in his social studies classes.

Many North Arlington residents
interviewed still have faith in
President Nixon.

Freight manager O’Connell said
he still doesn’t regret crossing
party lines to vote for Nixon. "The
President is just too big to get
involved in something like _this.
Its one of the biggest scandals to
hitfthe country. but he has to be

. above it."

But some of the Presidents
supporters are concerned he may
become more deeply involved. "li
they could tie Nixon into this
thing. then 1 would say. ‘God-
damn. it is bad.” said accoun-

- tantlHandrack.

Clothing store proprietor De
Angelis said, “I would still have
voted for Nixon. But if this thing
continues, it could hurt the gov-
ernment seriously.”

Advertising man 'l‘o‘n_v Cornell
could scarcely contain his anger
over Watergate. "l ama regis-
tered Republican. and I voted for
Nixon last November. but l say
now they should take all of his
stall and hang them." Cornell
said. *

Cornell was the only voter en-
countered in ;\'orth Arlington who
said he would now vote for George
McGovern if he could do It all
over again. "1 would vote for Mc-
Govern. it only for his honesty.’
he said.

But while Watergate is becom-
ing topic number one in conver-
sation, the people of North Arling-
ton haven’t figured out what they
are going to do about it.

"Many people around here
think it is just an extra thing that
has gone wrong.“ said managing

editor Murphy. "Compared to lo-
cal issues. it is still remote. And

faith has been shaken before. We
can bounce back.

at Mosque

Standing Ovation Show

By G. W. STEVENS

Steve Miller has brought his
band to Pittsburgh three times in
the last year. However, each time
his band has been comprised of
different musicians. Two weeks
ago, on Sunday night, Steve Mill-
er again appeared at the Syria
Mosque,‘ bringing with him a
group of three new performers.

The band opened the show with
some fine rock and roll. They
first performed "My Dark Hour"
and continued on to “Love
Shock” and several other tunes
from Miller’s earlier albums. Here
Miller combined his talent as
lead guitarist with some equally
fine vocals.

But this was only the begin-
ning. The band now turned to
playing the blues. Steve Miller
has always been famous for his
blues music, and the reason was
quite evident. He has a style
all his own, accented by his
fast hand and comical lyr-
ics. His performance of “Blues
Without Blame” was the high-
light of this portion of the show.

In compliance with the re-

Pitlsburgh Symphony

quests of the crowd. the group
now got into some of Steve‘s
more popular songs.

After they did "The Gang-
ster" and "The Gangsters Back."
the group performed the tradition-
al "Space Cowboy.“ Next.’bass-
ist Larry Taylor, organist Ben
Sidran, and drummer Dave New-
man put their talents to good

‘ use on “Living in the U.S.A.".
-freeing‘ Miller from his guitar

and vocals. This‘ gave him an
opportunity to demonstrate his
mastery of the harmonica.

At this point the band left the
stage only to have Steve return
with his acoustic guitar. He mov-
ed to the front of the stage and
finished the concert on his own.
He performed “Baby’s House,”
“Kow Kow,” and “Seasons. He
left the stage, followed by a tre-
mendous ovation.

Steve Miller has always been
an excellent composer-perform-
er who leads his band well. ‘As
I stated earlier, no matter who
heplays with the results areal-
ways the same. And this concert
was no exception. .

0 Lucky /vlan not So Lucky

By JOHN SMITH

The team of Lindsay Ander-
son and Malcolm ,McDowell is
back on -the screen again with
0 Lucky Man and even though
this is what Anderson has call-
ed a spiritual sequel of If my
advice is let the buyer beware.

The two films bear little
resemblance to each other ex-
cept in the names at the end of
the show. And, judging from
the public relations treatment I
got, the snow will fly when
the movie opens in the summer.

Past laurels are liable to pro-
vide a strong enough influence
to sell what the PR fact sheets
are calling the hottest flick
since Gone With the Wind.

The story itself is a simple one.

Our hero is Malcolm McDowell

he shows his luck by immediately
distinguishing himself as a cof-
fee salesman.

mad scientists. seductive land-
ladies, cruel businessmen, goes to
jail. comes out reformed (from
crimes he never committed).
finds out that idealism isn't the
answer, and in the end. every-
thing‘s groovy and life is really a
ball even though it isn't all
good.

For three hours this goes on.
These episodes are peppered lit-
erally with a boppy soundtrack
by Alan Price (the theme should
be hitting WIXZ before
long). When I walked out, all I
could say was “So what?”. .

Although McDowell did as
well as possible with this rath-
er superfluous script, any_impact
the film could have possibly
made was completely negated by
the incredibly poor judgement of
Anderson.

The movie was made incon-
grous by the insertion of studio
scenes of the Alan Price band

singing songs which were sup-

too,

posed to comment on the action.
Also chopping apart the contin-
uity was silent movie type open-
ing sequence and later, another
gimmicky silent movie insert.

These annoyances, coupled with
the unbearable length ofthe film
and the incessant moralizing of
Anderson, put this movie at the
bottom of the things to see list.

However. it’s a perfect exam-
pie of what’s been plaguing mov-
ies recently. That is, when will.
directors (especially superstar dir-
ectors) start giving audiences
well-told, well-constructed stor-
ies, instead of insipid, lengthy
drivel which is usually nothing
more than the director’s self-in-
dulgences.

If film making is an art——and

I have my doubts at times—it_
must leave us with some sort of ~

unified impact. Something which
0 Lucky Man fails to accom-
plish.

Recently the much acclaimed Deep Throat made its second
short-lived appearance in this City. I waited in the line for the
9 p.m. showing at a porno theatre on Liberty Avenue, with a
group of perverts that would make your skin crawl—married cou-
ples, businessmen, yes, even college students.

But, just as it came time for me to lay down my cash and
see for myself what the furor was all about, I was saved in the
nick of time by well-known model of morality DA Duggan. How
fortunate we are here in Pittsburgh to have a man who knows so
well what's right and what’s wrong. A man who will defend vir- ,

we at any cost.

So, Mr. Duggan, this is my thanks to you for helping to
keep this town lily-white and iust one clean step behind the times.

‘Compo ny’ Good Compci ny

There is a new Company in
town. and it is good Company in-

deed. The new theatrical com-

pany is called ‘Camelot Produc-
tions. and the musical. COM-
PANY, is their second produc-
tion. They are staging the play
in an old‘ movie theater on Lib-
erty Avenue in the Bloomfield
section of the city; until recently.
it had been used for Italian-
language films on Saturdays and
occasional Bingo games.

Camelot has shined the old Pla-
za upinicely, and they are offer-
ing a splendid brand of lively
theater on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday evenings from now
through May 20. The location
may seem a little odd. butVCOM-
PANY is worth the trip.

The songs by Stephen Sond-
heim, are dandy, although only
one of them .(“The Ladies Who
Lunch”) has received any atten-
tion outside of the play. It is a

. musical; what. little plot there is

in the book by George Furth is

"easy to follow and unlikely to dis-

tract your attention from the mu-
sic and the well-staged prancing
around.

Both of the Co-Producers ap-

pear in prominent roles. Nan
Sommers plays Amy. who wears

_ not

a wedding gown almost every
minute she is on stage. This is
disconcerting. as her wedding is
scheduled until halfway
through the show. The opening
scene is a birthday party some
time before the wedding; her
gown is very noticeable. and
makes her easy to follow. Nan
Sommers has a small pleasant
voice. and carries her share of the
first act. This is more than we
have a right to expect from the
average co-producer.‘ but" she
improves on it in a splendid bit

of patter-singing. She .. sings as’

fast as a computer printout; not
only faster than the ordinary
mouth could manage. but about
as quick as the ear can. follow.
And it all comes out even.

..Jerry Comunale, Jr.. the other
co—producer, sings and speaks the
main role. Robert. Robert is sin-
gle. and has been for a long
time. Except for three girls who
pop up now and again. he is the
only unpaired character. His ten
friends are really five couples.

and they almost invariably ap--

pear as couples, to emphasize

his single state. What story there

is concerns their efforts to ’ join
the ranks of the married. He is
visible almost all the time. and

does a'.good job most of the

. choreographer.

Q Theater. lA_

time. The only quibble I have
is that, good as his voice is, he
seems to think it is even better.
Mr. Comunale can fill the
whole place with his voice. and
does so from time to time. wheth-
er it is strictly necessary or not.
No matter. He keeps things mov-
ing at a lively pace in his many
functions. '

The settings are nicely done;
a set of platforms at varying
heights provide half a dozen act-
ing areas, and serve equally well
as a park, a terrace or a living
room with the addition of a lit-
tle furniture. . .

The background suggests New
York City convincingly.

Among the credits is a listing
for master carpenter; his name is
John Genre. At first the setting.
although it does use the limited
space cleverly. wouldynot seem
to justify the mention. In the
second act a portable bedcham-
ber appears; Mr. Genre is indeed
a master.

Among the five couples, Jen-
ny. and David, done by_Marilyn
Stone and Gorman Lowe are
great fun. They are both large
persons, and take advantage of
the fact, ending every ponder-
ous motion with a delicate ges-
ture.‘ Though round, they are
square and proud of it; when
they get stoned with Robert,
they are the perfect blend of
euphoria and responsibility.

Sarah and Harry (Michele
Rakiecz and Bud Mellottt prob-
ably shop at Sears. She is into
karate. He is on. the wagon. They
suit one another well. and expose
Robert to their brand of domes-
ticity. ' '

Susan and Peter (Corinne Tut-
tie and John Appelt appear from
time to time with bits of their
own story; they get a divorce.
but do not separate. They are
given little to do. but do it fine.

‘Galen Girvin plays Paul, the
groom to go with Amy in the
bridal outfit. ‘He has little to
sing and less to say, but he does
his one thing just right — for
two and a half hours he looks ex-
actly like the little man on the
top of any wedding cake you care
to name. i .

Larry. the prosperous third
husband of Joann. is done by
Jack Kelly. He is appropriately
stiff and stuffy. ‘

Ruth Cotton. as Joann. is a
pip! She is bawdy. blowzy. and

2

a bit boozy around the edges.’

She is raucous. rowdy, and a
rip-snorter with ’a song. She
makes a powerful effect. and
you will have to see it because
I cannot describe it. She sings
about the ladies who lunch. a
fine song even if it has nothing
to do with the play; she makes
it work.

Amy Scanlon, Sherry Earl and
Barbara Deutsch do their best
with the sketchy parts of the
three girlfriends; they sing well

and move nicely, but they don’t«

have enough to do.

The stage at the Plaza is shal-
low ‘— the whole gang manages
to go through some fine dance
numbers anyway. There is no
Mr. Comunale.
as director. has arranged to keep
the cast moving but never in
danger. '

The music is splendid. Before
the second act the orchestra
plays alone. and it is .worth- cut-
ting intermission short.

tertainment. It will onlyula-st a
few weeks. For students it costs

' $2.75. Nuff sed.

Below, Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar looks on, trying to bear up
to the cold, damp weather that plagued the drills.

As if he wasn't busy enough with recruiting and the drills, Majors
sponsored a high school coach's clinic over the weekend, which was
termed a big success by those who attended. With spring drills ending
Saturday, Majors will have some time to evaluate his personnel and

determine what weaknesses must be filled at the August Johnstown

. E ?Jews for Jesus? Yes. Quite a number of

Jewish, students arelturning on to Christ ‘

I ’ nowadays. Not seven out'of eight as we
show'her"e, tongue’ in cheek, but it,i‘s'a*

significant trend allover the nation.
Why? we don’t have..a’ny’ "simple answers.
Allwet know is that a lot of‘people’s
lives,-are beingchanged.

How‘? -Sojmeésay that the deep emptiness '
. -they used to feel is gone. ‘Others tell A
"a show anxiety and loneliness have been

replaced bylove and a new sense of

 fbelonging.‘All of,them are convinced of
one thing. They have discovereda deep 
. ‘personal experience. V ,. . ' A

. It's not easy to explain about*J_esus. How
7 1 he works in people's lives. Orihow he
' fills-the emptiness and lon'eliness.;The
..‘ - only way a person can understand is to
‘ experience it personally. '

‘  How does that happen? it starts by ‘rec-
ognizing a need. If you don’t think you

have any, Jesus said he couldn't help i

you. But if you -feel you have some 1

needs, an.d would like an answer, just

ask Jesus.‘

'- e is itlreallythat simple? That_‘depends on 1

you. Take, for-instance, the seven stu-
dents in the above picture. Each of them
‘simply prayed and told God they didn’t

El understand'all_this, but they believed a 
-- -Christ could’ change their lives. I

It worked! Something happened. For
the first time, they experienced a close-
ness to God. Only one thing happened
they‘ didn’t expect. The feeling didn’t go
away. It stayed, and grew stronger each
day. I I ' _.

Can this experience happen to you?
Maybe. If you’recogniz'e a need in your e \
Ii-fe an‘dr'eally.w'ant Jesus to meet it «-4

"i he will. Christ "said that he came to give“ I

you ‘a more _abundant‘life.

If you want that tonhappen just ask him". '
right now. But don’t play with Him‘. If .
you. ask really mean it_. That's the only

V way Ch ristcan make it happen to you.‘

If you do, we can promise you one thing.

_It will probably be the greatest experi-

ence of your life.

'_Then<just give us acall right here in.

you did, and it.worked. You’won’t have
to explain. We'll Iunderstand. 1
