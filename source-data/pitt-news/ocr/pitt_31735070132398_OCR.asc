Sooner or later, you are bound to be
confronted with an evening that has to be
absolutely perfect. Whether it be a birth-
day, anniversary or ﬁrst date, you will need
to step out and splurge. For these occa-
sions, you may want to visit Baum Vrvant.

Make no mistake; this is not a restau-
rant for those on a tight budget. You don’t
swing by for a bite before the - game. But it
does offer an elegant, intimate atmosphere
that is a sure pleaser when you are out to
impress. This Shadyside restaurant is
owned by Toni Pais, who is also the chef.
He specializes in French,_ Northern Italian,
Portuguese and American ﬂavors. Take
your next date to Baum Vrvant for a
romantic evening, but don’t forget to dress
up, and be sure to bring some extra cash.

Cafe Sam
5442 Baum Blvd.
$$$

Finding a nice restaurant with afford— 

able prices can be quite a task these days.
Cafe Sam, with its romantic atmosphere,
delicious food and reasonable prices, could
be just the restaurant you’ve been search-
ing for.

The dimly lit restaurant has a gourmet,
classy feel, without being overly formal.
The menu includes more than 100 appetiz-
ing options, including many steak, chick-
en, ﬁsh and pasta delicacies. Dinners are
usually dished out in large portions,
accompanied by tasty, optional sides. Ifbig
helpings aren’t your thing, Cafe Sarn’s
lunch menu offers many of thesame entic-
ing foods in smaller portions. -

Service is prompt and polite, makin

_ Cafe Sam a perfect place to take almost

anyone. Your date will love the pretty

atmosphere and the complementary cook-

ies at the end of the meal, and your parents
will love the wide variety and economical
prices. Cafe Sam is an appropriate restau-
rant for almost any occasion.

— Rachael Dizard

 

Whether you’re looking for a restau-
rant to cap off a trip through the Carnegie
Museum of Art or are just looking for a
place to eat without the hustle and bustle of

places closer to campus, the Carnegie Cafe 5

is for you.

p Offering a variety of daily specials and
regular menu items ranging from dirmer-
sized salads to sandwiches to “Pittsburgh’s
best omelet,” the Carnegie Cafe has some-
thing to appeal to everyone.

, But it’s the atmosphere that sets it
apart from other restaurants. Situated at
one end of the museum, restaurant—goers

. will ﬁnd the lack of congestion in the din-

ing area of the Carnegie refreshing.
Flanked on one side by the artistic
fountains near Forbes Avenue, and facing
the entrance to the museum, which
includes a piece of modern art, patrons are

treated to a unique dining environment that I

gives cult11re along with the entree.

Order a cup of tomato ‘soup and a
grilled cheese sandwich to go with your
cup of tea. Entrees such as ﬁsh and chips,
and roast beef and mashed potatoes can be
found on the menu as well. Order a cup of
tea and a slice of lemon meringue pie to top
it all off.

Sit, talk and relax, letting the outside
drift by — it’s OK, you’re warm and cozy,
drinking your spot of tea.

Fuel & Fuddle

Panther Funds \

The menu of the restaurant deﬁnes
“fuel” as something that is consumed, or
something that heightens or maintains the
level of activity, and “fuddle” as a state of
confusion usually associated with intoxica-
tion. Fuel & Fuddle deﬁnitely provides
adequate amounts of all of the above.

.\V1th a large range of selections on the
menu, featuring names like Rosemary’s

‘ Breasts and Heartburn. Heaven, the restau-

rant offers unique combinations that ﬁt
almost any person’s desire for fuel. The
drink selection also echoes the name, with
sufficient varieties of alcohol to get even
the hardiest drinker “fuddled.” There are
10 types of beer on t_ap and more

beer, from around
the world,
offered by the
can or bottle.

If food crav-

late at night, the
extensive half-price

option between 11
p.m. and 1 a.m. The
atmosphere of casual
chaos with brick walls-
and loud crowds is upped
on Tuesday nights, when a

live band performs in the restaurant, and on
Saturdays, when the feature is a ‘live,
acoustic guitar performance.

Another popular choice is any of the

20—ounce mixed drinks, such as the Jolly

Rancher and Bahama Mama,’ that come

adorned with a candy necklace or ring pop.

Hemingway’s is also appealing because,

with its spacious back room, it is one of the

few places in the area that can accommo-

date a large group.

you love the biweekly tomato soup—and-

za? Whenever you try to make grilled-
cheese sandwiches at home, they just
aren’t as satisfying as the ones you
devoured at camp. _

Short of driving back -to Maine or
Maryland or Montana, order the delectable
sandwiches from the LI-IAS Coffee Shop
at UPMC Monteﬁore and recapture .a bit of
your youth. If you love the crunch of a
well-grilled grilled—cheese sandwich and
the most exquisitely crispy, delicious fries,
the Monteﬁore coffee shop will not disap-

But the Monteﬁore coffee shop does-
n’t just make fantastic grilled—cheese sand-

South Oakland has Uncle Sam’s,
Primanti Bros. and the Wing Pitt — and
North Oakland has Mitchell’s. Located
smack in the middle of North Oakland, at
Melwood and"Centre avenues (just behind

Mitchell’s Tavern), Mitchell’s has the low:

key decor of a place where the focus is
good, greasy food. In particular, their
cheesesteaks are the best this T side of
Harrisburg —— as Philly ernigres will be
happy to hear. No deli-style meat and
evenly applied cheese slices here — we’re
talking beef or chicken, sliced and diced,
smothered in gooey -cheese perfection.
Whether you’ve got the beer munchies or
a case of eastern Pennsylvania homesick-

~ ness, any night’s a good night to stroll on
over and treat yourself to a good, old—fash— '— ’

ioned sandwich, North Oakland style.

Often voted best breakfast in the
‘Burgh, Pamela’s is sure to have a line
outside on weekend mornings. Famous
for their eggs, potatoes and pancakes,
Pamela’s is worth the wait — even as the
wind blows down Forbes Avenue on a
cold Winter morning. "

Pamela’s is open’ for breakfast and
lunch seven days a week. Beyond the

egg and potato standard, Pamela’s offers '

some of the best pancakes in. town ——
both traditional-style and crepe—style.

Served with a huge dollop of butter, the»
crepe—style ones are not to be missed by

any pancake fan.

Pamela’s also serves a variety of
lunch foods, including soups, salads and
sandwiches. As one looks around the

restaurant, though, it’s no surprise that
Pamela’s is a breakfast‘ joint ,— even

well after noon, the majority of cus— "

tomers will order eggs and potatoes or
pancakes.

Certainly, Pamela’s caters to this
reputation, even serving a platter called
“the Morning After.” Served with cof-
fee, for around $5 customers can get
Pame1a’s‘own hangover helper, a good
—ol’ greasy breakfast.

Pamela’s re lars know to bring
cash, because the restaurant doesn’t
take credit or debit cards. But it’s worth
the extra stop at the ATM to satisfy a

craving for Oakland’s most famous

breakfast. “-

Ritter’s might be a bit far from cam-

certainly isn’t too far when a comfort-

away, Ritter’s offers customers home-

Ritter’s is a traditional diner. It’s the
sort of place where grandmotherly wait-
resses call customers “hon.” It’s the sort
of place where caffeine—deficient
studiers can set up camp during ﬁnals
‘week and always find a cup of hot joe.
It’s the sort of place where the smoking
section is twice the size of the non-
smoking section.

No matter what the hour — Ritter’s
is open 24 hours —— someone with a

breakfast craving can find satisfaction. ’

Eggs any style and home fries ﬁt the bill
any time of day. No wonder there’s
always a moming—after contingent on
weekend mornings. A
More than comfort breakfast foods,
Ritter’s serves all the traditional diner
fare, from burgers and‘ fries to soups and
sandwiches. Ina relaxed setting, with
low-key service, Ritter’s is Oakland’s

Ali Baba Restaurant
404 S. Craig St.

(412) 682-2829

’$$

An icon of Oakland’s ethnic food

. scene, Ali Baba’s is one of only a few

Middle Eastern restaurants remaining in
Pittsburgh. Located on South Craig
Street, it’s only a few blocks away, for
curious students eager to get away from
the greasy cheeseburger cuisine of cen-
tral campus. '

Offering an assortment of standard
Middle Eastern foods, Ali Baba’s is a
safe place for those who are a bit hesi-
tant about ethnic foods. From Greek sal-
ads with traditional lemon and herb
dressing to meaty shish kebabs, every-
one’s likely to find something of interest
on the menu. For vegetarians and veg-
ans, Ali Baba’s provides options cus-
tomers are unlikely to ﬁnd elsewhere in

Oakland —— from hummus and salads to A

grape leaves. ,
Ali Baba’s is casual dining for the

, both lunch and dinner hours. The restau-
. rant is small and quaint, but ’ ’

the wait staff is fast-moving
and friendly. It’s a good bet
for someone who’d like a
sit-down meal, but is still in

the 15 tables in the restaurant, the por-
tions are big and the food is tasty.-
The menu includes traditional

iMiddle Eastern dishes like hummus,

falafel and shish kebabs. The parsley-
intense tabbouleh is a standout. If you
aren’t feeling particularly adventurous,
or ‘you justineed to get your cholesterol
ﬁx, cheesesteaks and burgers are on the
menu too. _ _ . '

If you’re hungry and alone, tl1at’s
OK — you may find yourself dining
alone,.together with a cute cardiologist
at the next table.

Who can argue with the “Original
House of Shish Kebab”? Khalil’s II
boasts some of the ﬁnest Middle Eastern

cuisine in Pittsburgh. The restaurant

received numerous awards from the
likes of Pittsburgh Magazine and the

 

Pittsburgh Post—Gazette. The chicken
and lamb shish kebabs are particularly
well-regarded. It also serves shrimp and
beef shish kebabs. Also notable are the
homemade soups.

If meat isn’t your thing, don’t worry.
There’s ‘an extensive menu of vegetari-
an-friendly. dishes. In fact, the restaurant
seems to be a local favorite of vegetari-
ans. ~
‘Moreover, they have a variety of
specialty cocktails, along with a full-ser-
vice bar. The atmosphere is casual, and
parking is no problem. Next time you
crave quality meat on a stick, visit

The enormous refrigerator cases of
imported cheeses are the first things you
see. The ﬂoury smell of warm pita is the
first thing you smell. And the first thing
you bump into is the cell phone kiosk.

Salim’s, the tiny, Middle Eastern
delicatessen on Centre Avenue, is an
unlikely place to buy a Nokia, but rose-'
water, dolmades and cell phone service

are all available. Off to the left of the lit- .

tle shop is an even smaller dining room
where you can have a seat and a sand-

a bowl of lentil soup.

When Friday night rolls around, Pitt stu-

too classy, some are too crowded and others

At the top of this category sits Peter’s
Pub, located conveniently within walking
distance of the most of South Oakland’s res-
idences. If college bars released a brochure,
Peter’s Pub could grace the cover. Its classy
but not over-the—top atmosphere is ideal for
hanging out ‘

Last year’s audience winner for
Pittsburgh’s best college bar on
Citysearch.com, Panther Hollow Inn
looks, to the ‘newcomer, to be an
average bar, but it has a special place
in the hearts of the locals. '

Located between Carnegie
Mellon University’s campus and
Craig Street, the bar usually has more
student patrons from CMU than from
Pitt. CMU football players come on
Mondays for $3 domestic pitchers,

and CMU alumni come back for their
reunion.

Known as “Phi—bar” or “P—H—I,”
Panther Hollow Inn has a dartboard,
several televisions to broadcast every
Pittsburgh team and a jukebox filled
with classic rock. The booths that line
the wall are accessible even when
there’s a crowd and are perfect for
eating the pizza, which, of course,
goes well with beer.‘ The pizza is
made in the back of the bar in a small,
Italian kitchen known as Pizza Paul.
Besides being one of the best—kept
and best-tasting pizza secrets in
town, students can get a plain pie for
only $6.50 any night of the week.

words like “KenTacoHut,” o_r
“Ohmagadthisiscool.”

That means you can have refried
bean pizza smothered in mashed pota-
toes, provided you’re willing to get
downright messy with your food.

But for the traditionalist, it means
you and all of your friends can come
to the same place to eat, and everyone
will likely find something he or she is
happy with. Though each third of this
super—restaurant doesn’t havethe full
menu of its stand—alone counterpart,
the creators of this institution have
picked the more sought—after foods
from each venue.

Get personal pan pizzas, bread-
sticks, drumsticks, thighs, burritos,
tacos and so much more. Mix and
match for added enjoyment, and
you’ll no doubt walk away happy and
filled.

‘ ‘Of course, if you’re determined to
consume obscure menu items from the
various entities making up this fast-
food conglomerate, you can always
check out the KFC, located at 4915
Baum Blvd., or the Taco Bell at 5205

It’s refreshing to visit a coffee shop

that’s one of a kind. And not only is Craig '

Street Coffee unique, it’s more than a cof-
fee shop. II1 addition to a nice array of the
caffeinated stuff, the shop offers sand-
wiches, soups, salads and desserts. ' The
extensive sandwich menu can ﬁx you up
with something grilled, something deli-
style or even something vegetarian. There
are alwaysplenty of fresh baked goods;
the chocolate chunk cookies are the
largest you have ever seen.

The shop’s coffee beans are supplied
super—fresh by a local roasting company
—— you can buy them by the pound to
grind on your own if you like. There are
many espresso drink choices and the spe-

' cialty concoctions are tempting." You can

order to go or eat there. Try to nab one of
the sidewalk tables if the weather is pleas-

Ah, coffee —— that heady, life-giving
elixir.

At Crazy Mocha Coffee Company,
the employees, well-versed in coffeeo1o-

lowliest cup of drip decaf to the most
decadent mocha creation. Its signature
drink, the Crazy Mocha, is a fantastic cre-
ation made with espresso, steamed milk,
chocolate and ice cream. .

But there’s more than just the
delightful jolt of caffeine and chocolate at
Crazy Mocha. You can also get pastries,
like the almond mele, a buttery pastry

‘pocket filled with sweet, fragrant

almonds, or a panini that’s plump with
spinach and feta cheese. '

gers turning pages of classic literature,
it’s easy to forget that Kiva Han isn’t a
library. The main differences? You‘ can
talk as loud as you want, you won’t have
to use any of your print quota and —-— of
course — Kiva Han serves a variety of
beverages that Faulkner and Descartes
could never provide.

Both of Kiva Han’s Oakland loca-
tions sell the spectrum of coffee bever-
ages, from your standard joe to the fanci-
est of Arabica coffee bean lattes. Have a
pastry with your coffee or, on a warm
day, ditch the hot stuff and sit outside
with a cup of iced coffee or juice. Plus,
Kiva Han advertises a special brew every
month. ‘

Founded in 1993 by Ed Wethli, Kiva
Han is supposedly named for history’s

fancy, eclectic pick—me-ups.

Starbucks offers everything from hot
chocolate and iced lattes to coconut
Frappuccinos and chai tea. Employees
know their stuff when it comes to cus-
tomizing and preparing the drinks. There
is always a regular-, decaf- and breakfast-
coffee blend of the day. There are 18 vari-
eties of coffee beans — which range
from $5.10 for a half-pound to $11.95 for
a pound — and the array of coffee acces-
sories are essential for at-home coffee
consumption.

- Drinks come in tall, grande and venti
sizes, and the most expensive drink on
the menu is $4.10. Food prices range
from a 35-cent shortbread cookie to a
$2.25 piece of crumblebeny coffee cake.

Although it continues to ﬁght anti-
capitalism protesters, this Starbucks will
also continue to provide its customers
with velvet couches, The New York

coffee. - '

Korea Garden is a hidden treasure of

some authentic Korean and Japanese dishes.

One such Korean dish is bulgoki, a gen-

sliced beef in a delicious, sweet brown sauce.
A bowl of rice and six small vegetable gar-
nishes accompany the meat. Another
favorite, bi—biIn bap, includes a bowl of rice
topped by beef, various vegetables and a
ﬁied egg, and is served with a tangy, smoky
red pepper sauce. The myriad of colors, tex-
tures and tastes here contribute to a pleasur-

Of course, you might want to go with
the old—school, and Sushi Boat can accom-
modate. They serve kani, avocado and raw
salmon in sushi rolls, as well as vegetarian
fare, various noodle and rice bowls, and an
excellent Miso soup. ,
A meal of one sushi roll with ginger and
wasabi and a bowl of soup ranges from $5 to
$8.

It was a sad day for all Pitt students
when Szechuan Express ﬁxed its trademark
line “We are also have fun food you are
never ate before” on its awning.

Fortunately, the now—grammatically-
sound “Schwan” is no less authentic in its

food preparation than it ever was. Long rec— .
ognized as the pinnacle of South Oakland : -

Chinese take—out restaurants, the Schwan
specializes in noodle dishes from all manner
of Asian cooking styles, including Taiwan
noodles, pad Thai and Vietnamese noodle
soups.

Often for less than $5, Oakland dwellers
can also enjoy the staples of Chinese food,
like General Tso’s chicken and beef with
broccoli, all served promptly and with gen-
erous portions over rice.

The charm of the Schwan is largely in

its lack of pretense. While it is perhaps a lit-
tle intimidating at ﬁrst, after a few trips, any
regular will become used to the cashier talk-
ing on her cell phone or the small child run-

_ ning around behind the counter, and accept

both as hallmarks of a family-nm eatery.

When Chinese take-out is no longer
enough to tingle your taste buds, cuisine
ﬁom Thailand may provide a ﬂavorful alter-
native. Heavy use of spices like lemongrass
and coriander allows Thai food to retain
deep, tantalizing ﬂavor, whether it’s prepared
spicy or mild.

t..-..... . ".¢n .. I z-

The Thai Place Cafe, located on South
Craig Street, masters all of the ﬂavors of
Thai cooking and offers them to the college
community at reasonable prices. A good
measure of any Thai restaurant is the quality
of the pad Thai, a traditional noodle dish, or
the torn yum soup, a spicy, mouth—waten'ng

soup that is a sure cure for any cold. A key
ingredient to Thai cooking is coconut milk,

which the Thai Place uses subtly in the torn
kha soup and the curries, which are served
over rice. 4

A nephew to the award—winning Thai
Place restaurant on Bellefonte Street in
Shadyside, the Thai Place Cafe has lost none
of the family-run feel in its branching out.
Don’t come in a hurry —— be prepared to
repeat your order slowly and to be asked

While most Mexican restaurants try
to simulate the theme of Mexico for their
patrons, entering La Fiesta truly makes
you feel like you’ ve stepped south of the-
border. \ - ~ ,

. After walking past the wooden wind
chimes, the first thing that hits patrons is
the jaunty Mexican music, full of guitars
and quick verses ‘in Spanish. The bright
orange stucco walls are accented with
jeweled sombreros, red maracas, acoustic
guitars and miniature scenes ‘of Mexico.

The friendly servers and complimen-
tary fresh salsa and corn chips add to the
experience. The food is served in tradi-
tional Mexican style and is made by
Vmcente Valdez, who learned the recipes
from his grandmotherwhen he lived in
Mexico.

Order any combination of burritos,
tacos, enchiladas and a variety of other
Mexican foods in either apre—designed
platter or separately. Or, to satisfy the late-
night Mexican cravings, skip the madness
of Taco Bell and take advantage of the
authentic La Fiesta food served at half

price Monday through Saturday between .

$$

Only about 45 Mexican food fans at a
time can fit into the sexy restaurant at 370
Atwood St. But it’s not unusual to see
hordes of people waiting outside for up to
an hour at a time to get a seat in the shiny
wood pews or at the curvy copper bar
inside Mad Mex. _ .

Part of the Big Burrito group of
restaurants, ‘Mad Mex serves tasty
Mexican-American fusion food in a —
shall we say — womb-like atmosphere
(it’s dark, it’s warm, it’s cramped).

One of the reasons Mad Mex attracts
such huge, patient crowds is that both ‘
meat eaters and vegetarians alike (vegans,
too) can ﬁnd‘ something yummy on its
lengthy menu, ranging from traditional
burritos and giant plates of nachos to tofu

. enchiladas made with soy cheese.

Another reason Mad Mex has so
many ardent fans is the many ways to eat
and drink cheaply. VV1th $6 lunch specials,
half-price meals with student ID, half-
price margaritas, drafts and wings during
happy hour, and late—night specials after»
