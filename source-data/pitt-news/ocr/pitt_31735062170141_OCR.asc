Tiny Analyzes -War, Sex

by PEGGY ALLEN
Staff News Writer
Tiny Tim is sexy. He’s tall, in-
telligent, gentle, sincere and mas-
culine. While at downtown Kauf-
mann’s last week to autograph
copies of his book, Beautiful
Thoughts, Tiny (as his manager
called him) talked seriously about
the war, sex, religion, and music.

“I want peace,” said Tiny, who
was wearing a yellow, blue, and
orange stripped tie and a peace
necklace. “There’s nothing like

and a .right‘kind of peace. The
wrong way is to just let the enemy
take over. If someone comes into
your home, you have to protect
yourself.”

Mr. Tim, who describes himself
as an extremely religious person,

One of . Americ -

     

then stated his views on sex. “I
don’t believe in kissing before
marriage,” he said, but added,
“I’m no saint myself, I have kiss-
ed girls, but the good Lord has
brought me back. I thank God that
I’m still a virgin.”

Tiny, who was almost married
two weeks ago, explained that he
is not against sex. “I don’t think
that it’s dirty —— just wrong before
marriage. Basically, kissing can
lead to something else. I would

_ love to keep every beautiful girl in;
peace, but there’s a wrong kind '

the world, but, God’s Law says
that it must be kept until marria-
age.” Tiny then pulled out the
Bible he carries in his coat pocket
and quoted several verses which
warned to flee fornication.”

When asked if he ever turns on,
Tiny gasped and said, “no, no. I

i

stay away from all drugs. To be‘
honest, however, I sometimes
drink beer — to relax after a base-
-ball game, but never drugs. Ugh,
even the smell of marijuana
makes me sick.”

“The reason that most people
take drugs is because they don’t
know the meaning of life — and
that is to find the kingdom of God.
I find my greatest relaxation by
listening to records, especially
from the l920’s, and day
dreaming about the gread adven-
tures that I’ve had.”

Tiny’s manager interrupted him
to say that it was time to leave for
the airport. Tiny said “good-bye”
and apologized for not being able
to eat dinner with The Pitt News
staff in Oakland.

 Houston, Four Others

Join Bramhall, ASCRC



by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, Pitt News

Five members, including Eco--
nomics Professor Dave Houston,
were selected by the Under-
graduate Council yesterday to
serve on the College of Artsand
Sciences Curriculum Review
Committee (ASCRC ).

The other four members, who
will join Houston and chairman
Dr. Dave. Bramhall (in addition
to three students to be selected
in the fall by the Student Cabin- '
et) were: Dr. Orlando Taylor,

Speech; Dr. Barrett ‘Mandel,
English; Dr. John Townsend,
Physics; and William Loerke,
Fine Arts.

Should any of the above, ex-
cept Houston (who was pres-
ent at the meeting and indicated
that he ‘would be able to sit on
the committee,) be undable to join
the committee, their replacements
are: Dr. Alfred Moye, Chemistry;
Dr. Marcia Landy, English; Dr.
Allen Janis, Physics; and Dr. Mar-
ilyn Frye, Philosophy.

Dr. Houston was the .topic of

‘discussion at the outset of the

meeting. According to Scott

Ritenour
  * Programs.
Director

Dr. Walter M. Ritenour, known
to thousands of University grad-
uatesias director of the Universi-
ty’s Placement Service, has been
named director of Special Pro-
grams at Pitt’s Graduate School
of Business (GSB).

The announcement was made
jointly by Assistant Chancellor
Jack B. Critchfield,. under.whose
direction Dr. Ritenour handled
the activities of the Placement
Service, and Dean H. J. Zoffer of
the Graduate School of Business.

In his new post, Dr. Ritenour

it will be in charge of student re-

cruitment, alumni relations, and

 placement liaison in the business. t

- Baum, one of the five students'sit—

ting on the Council with six
faculty members, Dean Jerry
Schneewind’s opening ;rémiarks
about the fact that Houston should
be treated as a special case were
correct.

Baum stated that students, who
were instrumental in establishing
plans for the committee last'win-
ter, were promised in the original
agreement that they would be al-
lowed to select the chairman of
the committee from the faculty.

Houston had been the first:
choice of the students, but they
later submitted the names of
three candidates from which the
faculty chose Bramhall, also of
the Economics department, chair-
man.

“Had the students not been of
the belief that Houston would

automatically be on the committee .

if he were not the chairman,
their‘ action in placing three
names would have been differ-
ent,” Baum noted. '

According to Baum, Mike Fab-

ricant, student representative to '

the Liberal Arts Cabinet, submit-
ted the names with the belief that
Houston was on the committee.
Because some faculty members
felt his political posture would be
disadvantageous to the commit-
tee if he were chairman, Hous-
ton’s name was not placed as one
of the three by Fabricant.

Although there was no record-
ed formal committment by the
Council, Houston was voted upon
separately, and received enough
votes to gain membership to the
ASCRC.

After the Council voted un-
animously to place a black mem-
ber of the faculty on the ASCRC,
Taylor was nominated. He will
arrive here from the University
of Indiana in the fall, and several
members of the Council and ‘a few
members of the audience spoke
highly of his work in the field of
experimental
ment. He was selected to the com-
mittee by a unamious vote.

The three vacant positions were
then filled by Mandel, Town-
send, and Loerke.

In his opening remarks, Dean
Schneewind ‘accented the need of

radical proposals from the .

' graduate Council

speech develop- Y

He stressed the fact that in addi-
tion to the Undergraduate Coun-
cil, the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences Council and eventually
the full Faculty Senate would
have to vote on the proposals of
the ASCRC.

After the ASCRC members
had been selected, Dean Schnee-
wind briefly mentioned other
new business that would have to
be discussed at future meet-
ings. '

He remarked that Dean of Stu-
dents Ronald Pease, University
Attorney, Jim Wolf, and himself
had met to discuss social rules.
Dean Schneewing pointed out
that a report by Joe Kociebus had
shown many problem areas in the
current dicipline procedures,
and that the meeting produced
a well needed step in the. direc-
tion of clarifying existing rules.

In the future, Deans will be
notified of students under his
jurisdiction who face possible

explusion for disciplinary action. ~
Also, the Dean of Students will be p

notified of all students facing

academic probation, suspension
or explusion.
In future meetings the Under-

will discuss
special CAS courses, “I” grades,

‘and the Physical Education re-

quirement.

Dean Schneewind
that the first special CAS course,
CASI_, would go into effect this
fall. CAS1 is the course in Sex
and Sexuality which no depart-
ment wanted to add to its cur-
riculum. Funds for the course
were raised by students and fac-
ulty interested in offering the
course. ’

According to Schneewind, the
possibility of such courses ex-
isting as special courses for a
maximum of two years and then
either being picked up by a de-
partment or being dropped will
add to the spectrum of experimen-
tal courses within the College of
Arts and Sciences.

Orientation Hosts Hove
Final Trcumng Session

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Availability and awareness became the catchwords of the
all-day .training session for the 60 students who volunteered to
serve as hosts and hostesses for the Freshman Orientation per-
iods this summer. The group met Saturday, chaired by Orienta-
tion Committee co-chairmen, Dave Guydan, Scott Dragan and

Ed Gill.

Ron Cowell, associate dean of students and coordinator for
the program, suggested that the philosophy of Orientation has
changed over the years. Cowell urged the prospective hosts to
go further than only serving the function of source of informa-

tion and reference.

“What you must do is to challenge the freshman to sit down

and think of his expectations of
college life,” he added.

Another point stressed was ori-

Posvar
Peace Trustee

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
has been elected to the Board of
Trustees of the Carnegie Endow-
ment for International Peace. His
election was announced in New

~ York City by the chairman of the

endowment, Whitney North Sey-
mour.

The endowment was established
in 1910 with a gift of $10 million
from Andrew Carnegie for the
purpose of promoting peace and
understanding and cooperating
with organizations having similar

_objectives. Income from the en-

dowment is used to finance re-
search, publications and other ed-
ucational activities administered
by the endowment staff to further
Mr. Carnegie’s expressed objec-
tives “. . . to hasten the abolition
of international war.”

The endowment’s trustees are
leaders in higher education, mass
media, international law, and cor-
porations. Headquartes for the en-
dowment are in United Nations
Plaza, New York City. Twenty-
five full-time and several part-
time trustees sit on the endow-
ment’s board. Dr. Posvar is a full
trustee.

— In his announcement of Dr. Pos-
var’s election, Mr. Seymour call-
ed attention to the chancellor’s
years of service in the field of ed-
ucation “specifically in policy as-
signments focussing on interna-
tional relations.”

He continued:

“He (Dr. Posvar) has written
extensively on international poli-
tics and decision making and has
served as‘ research associate at

     
  

. the MIT Center for International

entation vs. indoctrination. “Don’t . ‘ ,

let.your own impressions of the

- school and your own interests in-

fluence the freshmen too much”
was the maxim reiterated by a

number of the guest speakers who

came to fill in details. ' -
Donna Kwall Smith from the
Housing office, appeared to in-‘
form the group about dormitory
regulations and scholarship pro-
blems. Dean of Students Ronald
Pease discussed the personal ad-
vising program undertaken by the
Dean of Students staff. They meet

with groups of freshmen to talk .

over problems and perceptions.
Guydan spoke expansively on

the Orientation program struc- '

ture. When questioned on why an A

'ROTC program had been'sched- ‘A if

uled for each Orientation session,
he revealed that it was included so ‘
that “students may decide what to

. do about it before they makeup

their schedules.”
At the present time, engineer-
ing students are the only ones af-

fected credit—wise by ROTC since .
it has been transformed to the . ,

status of extra—curricular. They"
may take it as a substitute for phy-
sical education. '
- A recommendation that this seg-'
ment of the Orientation be includ-
ed only in the two out of four ses-
sions which prospective engineers V
attend was overruled by the Chan-
cellor. According to Guydan, the ‘
ROTC program has scheduled in
all the Orientation sessions.

' Also being continued this year is I

the Pitt Issues '69 forum initi- A

ated last year. The forum consists
of four students who speak on and
debate the campus events of the
past two terms. This year Scott

I Student Idealism Must Be Channeled
Into Reforms That Will lmprove Society

PART II

by PAUL R. SEBASTIAN
Graduate School of Business

(Editor's Note: This is the concluding segment of a
two part article discussing methodology for change at

 the University. In the first part, presented in last Fri-
, day’s edition of The Pitt News, Mr. Sebastian recom-

mended that change come after rational thought,
calm discussion, methodic procedure, and by working
through the establishment to change the status quo

I ’i rather than by completely scrapping the system.)

There are all kinds of little opportunities to in-
fluence the environment—even through many con-
versations and bull sessions. A suggestion to the
right person at the right time can be the one rock
that sets off the avalanche. Any idea has its origin
in one person. At the same time one has to keep in-
formed on the day’s issues and all points of view;

 then he’ll know what he’s talking about and be able

"to convincingly influence. Then too—instead of apa-

thetically accepting the candidates that the party

I C bosses dictate, why not take an active part in the
' party of your choice. Maybe you can run yourself

someday. Sure, politics is dirty. Politics is dirty be-
cause good men don’t do anything to make it clean.

We hear so much about something ought to be
done about the problems of the ghetto. Or, the gov-
ernment ought to do it—spend a $100 billion a year
and all our problems will be solved. How about the
many opportunities we as students have to help out
in the city on a part time basis? One can tutor, help
out in youth groups, participate in one of the several
“Y” programs crying for help, wherever feasible

. help with credit unions, cooperatives, recreation,

cultural enrichment of youth, legal advice, health,
housing, adult education, advise small business.
community organizations, help to develop local_
leadership, encourage local citizens to become in-
volved, etc. Hospitals are always open for volunteer
work with the patients. Make the Jaycees, Lions,
etc. social forces instead of social clubs. Take an
active part in campus and community organizations.
One leader who cares can give an apathetic~organ—
ization new life.

IF ONE OPENS his eyes and imagination, there

‘are countless ways to contribute. True, a green su-

burbanite with a paternalistic heart going in to save
the ghetto, will make a mess of it. Any volunteer

~ , must realize that he must learn a lot from the local

1 V their dogs from armedvservice.

i$Student Faints;

citizens in working with them before he can become

really effective and accepted.

 Just ‘the other day, I was told that something
like five Boy Scout troops have gone out of business
in the Hill. There are certainly enough of interested

52%. Problems Of

 

kids, but adult leaders don’t seem to care——neither
black militants, white activists, nor anybody else.
Oh sure——the Boy Scouts only teach white middle
class values. It’s old fashioned. I couldn’t think of a
better way to erase prejudice in the budding stage
than to have kids of all races working, playing, and
learning together at a Boy Scout camp. Such experi-
ences leave lifetime marks. .

But all of this grass roots work takestime. That’s
work and drudgery. It’s so much more exciting and
glamorous to raise hell, get the cops out and appear
on Huntley-Brinkley. Unless somebody does the
grass roots work, inidvidual WASP’s and WASP
companies are educated to their individual respon-
sibilities to the community, and Whites as well as
Blacks-change their attitudes and learn to cooper-
ate; everything is going to be the same if not worse.
Our tactics are shutting people off. If we can speak
with a record of constructive accomplishment in
the community, follow due process, and can sell our
ideas; I’m convinced that the establishment will
listen. After all-—we are their sons.

THIS WELL INTENTIONED activism is setting
dangerous precedents to freedom when the -will of
any minority group is imposed by force on the ma-
jority. That’s not democracy, SDS. If the majority
of the readers right and left don’t listen to my
views, do I now have a right to organize my own
group and force my views on you? If this line of
thinking becomes a way of life, our country will de-
teriorate to an anarchic second class power within
a few chaotic generations. Temporary and transi-
tory tyrann imposed to achieve worthwhile goals
consistently ends up as being permanent. Hate isn’t
going to change attitudes. It will only strengthen
them. There are many ways to sell your ideas.

We indeed should have a voice in running the
university, but we still are not prepared to run it
-ourselves. After listening to all sides an adminis-
trator must administer according to his conscience.
If there is to be order, he must have the last word.
If he runs the school by simply yielding to the most
powerful faction which can cause the most trouble,
he’s a pretty gutless leader. Can we learn from
student mistakes of other countries or are we too
going to learn the hard way? If we‘ can’t put our own
houses in order, somebody else will—the govern-
ment.

History has shown—you don’t change a culture
overnight. It takes years of grass roots work. Do
our campus activists have the commitment to do so
throughout their lives or will they too join the su-
burban status, money, and comfort clubs once the
youthful rebellion is out of their system? Every lit-
tle bit counts and really adds up after a time. What
will you do?

Last Thursday, a student pass-

class. A Tuck Shoppe waitress,
surveying the scene commented
that the girl “must have taken
dope.” Nothing could be further
from the truth. Far from being
a junkie, she is an epileptic.

Epilepsy is one of what doctors
call a “hidden handicap.” Such

Medic-Alert, Medi-Guard, or a
host of other names, stands for
emergency medical identification.
Any person with allergies, epilep-

 

sy, diabetes, or other “hidden
handicaps” should have that sign
on him. It will be either worn as a
necklace or bracelet, or carried

easily accessible wallet or purse.
People must make themselves
aware of this insignia and for what
it stands.

When someone suddenly films
or otherwise takes ill, don’t moral-
ize. Look for a Medic-Alert tag,
bracelet, or card and follow the in-
structions written on the back of
it. If there is no insignia, don’t pan-

In Elm City, Mrs. John Smith appeared at

“This is absolutely inhuman,” said Mrs. Smith.
“My Skippy will never set one of his four feet on a
battlefield. He might get killed in Vietnam.

Skippy was one of thousands of dogs drafted by
the Armed Services recently as a result of the Wash-

gers and special fighters. ’

before Congress, asked “What kind of barbaric
country are we living in that we offer up our house-
hold pets for wholesale slaughter? We must be for-

Congressman Albert Greenlove has charged the
White House with “cruelty more vicious and call-

Despite the promises of most institutions of higher education to
open their doors to larger numbers of minority students, blacks today
attend state universities in numbers so small they could be called token.
That, at least, is the finding of a survey of state university enroll-
ments compiled by the Southern Education Reporting Service of Atlan-

ta and released last week.

About five per cent of America

survey reported, but a majority of
them are enrolled in all-black or
mostly-black colleges and univer-
sities.

In 80 leading public and state
universities, those that “tradi-
tionally have served whites” but
which in theory are open to all,
blacks are less than two per cent
of the students.

Blacks make up about 11 per
cent of the American population
at large. One of the demands be-
ing made of many schools by black
students this year is that the
schools up their black enrollment
to 11 per cent, to match the per-
cent'age.of blacks in the society at

large. Some colleges and univer-

sities have even accepted this fig— -

ure as a goal for their admissions.

Other schools and educators
have proposed that universities
set as their standard for minority
admissions the percentage the
minorities make up regionally or
intheir cities.

How far universities currently
fall short of even that standard is
immediately apparent in a read-
ing of the SERS figures:

Of the 80,universities surveyed,
28 are in Southern and Border
states, where blacks make up
about 20 per cent of the popula-
tion. Their black undergraduate
enrollment percentage is 1.76.

In 11 schools in the East (whose
total black population is about 10
per cent), blacks are 1.84 per cent
of the student bodies.

In the Midwest, with 15 univer-
sities and a regional black popula-
tion of 10 per cent, black students
are 2.98 per cent. ' "‘

In the West’s 26 universities,
black students are 1.34 per cent of
the total student population.
Blacks make up five per cent of
the West’s population.

Altogether, the 80 schools en-
rolled 1,222,382 undergrad-
uates ‘ last fall; only 23,630,
or 1.93 per cent, were black.

Student Power Exists
Editor, The Pitt News:

In his recent letter to The Pitt

News, Mr. Grindlinger repeats

the angel/devil theory of the uni- ’

versity which one has come to ex-

pect from naive proponents of Stu- ,

dent Power. The theory suggests
that student power is an abstract
good in itself — power to do what
is seldom discussed. The admin-

istration, by this theory, is an ab-’

//‘"\.

stract evil in itself which is de— '

vted to repression of student pow-
er and therefore of all meaningful
university reform.

For students who wish to pro-
pose and pursue creative changes,
clear channels exist for making
those plans known. The Student
Government, with offices in "305
Schenley Hall, has shed the Mick-
ey Mouse image which it had in
the past. Student Government of-
ficers and representatives now
have regular access to the policy
shaping councils of the university
and most of those councils are
ready to listenand to act.

Committees of the Faculty Sen—_.-«.;'w‘.~\

ate often initiate changes in reg-
ulations and policy. A serious pro-
posal from one or more students
will receive acknowledgment and
a careful review from one or
more of these committees. A list
of these committees and their
members can be obtained from
the Student Government Office.

Let us hear from a student who
has seriously sought to change the

. university through these or other

channels that exist. If his ideas

have a wide acceptance and,yet../_-..

they are ignored or continually
stalled, then his charges of stu-
dent powerlessness will sound
far more convincing ‘than the ab-
stract complaints of’ Mr. Grind-
linger. - - ~ -

Radical, Conservative, Liberal, Easy. All labels, but meaning
what? Many people indulge in the habit of labeling others. It may be an
attempt at psychological security. It may as well be the result of psy-

chological laziness.

By placing others in a category and giving it a name, people do not
have to deal with others on an individual basis. They can set up a speci-
fic set of responses for certain “types of people” and react to those

they meet from this storehouse.

While this restricts interper-
sonal contact and communication
to an oblique level, it also is gross-
ly unfair to the individual who has
been classified, assigned qual-
ities- and shelved away for future
reference, because of his friends,
activities, appearance, or ideas.

Discussing certain taboo sub-
jects, subjects usually considered
socially “untouchable,” can cata-

pult intellectually-honest people

into the petty “canning compa-
nies” of others.

This happened to me and two
other women who spoke out on sex
roles and female sexuality at a
symposium last term.

Last week, one of the partici-
pants received a telephone call

, from a “fraternity.” The caller

insisted that he and his brothers
were so impressed by the content
and the openness of the forum
that theywished the three of us to

‘lead a “sensitivity session” on

the subject of sexuality at the
house. » .

When pressed to explain the
structure of this “sensitivity
group,” the caller outlined his fra-
ternity’s plans for us. “You’ll
each have. three,” he said. “You
can come over to the house, have

 

a few drinks, go upstairs and blow .

three guys.”

He obviously assumed that wom-
en who were not reluctant to speak
freely about sex and sexuality
must be “easy 1ays.” Instead of
dealing with our ideas, the “fra-
ternity” found it simpler to label
us easy and proceed from there.

The situation is rather pessis-
mistic for those who are striving
to bring new ideas_and taboo con-
cepts out into the open. Is it worth
it to run the risk of being proposi-
tioned and ridiculed because a
great number of people in this so-
ciety feel threatened by honesty?
When the motivation for change is

stronger than the fear of laughter 

and even ostracism, the risk is

1 worthit.A .

In Forty-School Competitiion

by BOB LEDERMAN

During the past several
weeks, Jim Banner’s thin-
clads have developed the de-
lightful habit of breaking records.
So, it was not unusual this past
weekend when the trackmen put
yet another record by the books
and equalled a second.

The tracksters were in Bowling
Green, Ohio, for the Central Col-
legiate Conference championship-
ship meet, an annual affair which
this year, drew no less than 40
of the finest track outfits in the
nation. T

The Blue and Gold, finishing an
impressive ninth in the meet, post-
ed their first points on the board
with a record breaking perform-
ance by the mile relay team. The
thinclad quartet of Wally Swiger;
Carlos Reisen, Rudy Hufnagle, and
Smitty Brown placed fifth in the
event behind Michigan State’s
3:10.5. The trackmen’s effort of
3212.3 was more than adequate
to lower the previous school rec-
ord of 3:13.1.

The 440-yard Intermediate Hur-
dles competition, capably handled
by junior Carlos Reisen, was an-
other event where the thinclads
picked up points as they once
again ignored the record books.
Reisen, in racing to a fourth place
finish, tied the University record
of 52.9 set by Paul Trash in
1958.

Jerry Richey, entered in both
the three-mile and six-mile races,
finished fourth and second, re-
spectively.

Commenting on Richey’s sec-
ond place in the six-mile, Banner
noted, “It was Jerry’s first time
running the six—mile race in over
a year. I think his inexperience in
that particular event may have
hurt him.”

Dan Kouvolo, improving upon
his effort a week ago in the IC4A’s
(221-4) , captured a third
place in the javelin with a 227
toss. Kouvolo’s third place effort
was an encouraging note for the
sophomore hurler who, in recent
weeks, has had some well-below-

V par throws.

Ridl. Announces Another
Tcill Roundball Recruit

Coach Buzz Ridl announced last week that Randy Arnold,

The men of Banner tallied their
final points on the strength of
Bryant Salter’s 47-2 leap in
the triple jump. Salter, now fully
recovered from an early season in-
jury, captured a sixth in the event.

This weekend, the thinclads will
be off to Lexington, Ky., where
they will participate in the Na-
tional Federation Championship
Meet. The tracksters will, how-
‘ever, be going with the mile relay
team which failed to qualify.

Banner hopes the tracksters
don’t break their habit of shatter-
ing school records.

Even if tennis coach Ben Pope was an expert at solving pus
zles, he still might have difficulty figuring out a most awesom

puzzle which faces him now.

. Somehow, someway, Pope must build his net squad piece by:
piece into a. respectable unit. After losing all of 13 matches}.
this past spring, one would normally expect the team to depend.

upon new faces.

Yet, attempting to mold a new
tennis picture isn’t quite so easy.
True, freshmen‘ will be eligible to
compete in varsity tennis from the
start of the schedule next year.
But, if the present trend continues,
the frosh who do arrive at Sky-
scraper U. just may not be enough.

Pope said, “Most of the boys A

want to go to school out of town. I
felt sure some good boys were
coming to Pitt; then they ended up
going elsewhere.’ ’

During the past season, Pope
uttered the same kind of state-
ments — seemingly pessimistic,
but always realistic. Recently, he
stated that he has a good chance
to recruit three outstanding tennis
players.

Pope, however_, feels another
important change is essential to
the well-being of the tennis pro-
gram. “If the school switched to a
fall schedule, it could change the
picture,” Pope said, explaining
that the weather and number of
matches would remain about the
same, and that more netmen
would try out for the squad.
