Class Room Talks
Given by Students
Climax Fund Drive

Pitt Chest current drive
was highlighted today by a
series of talks in class rooms
during fourth hour. The talks
were given by volunteers

from various school organiza-
tions. « I

“The drive is off to a good
start,” said Sam Reich, Col. ’57,
chairman of the Pitt Chest Com-
mittee, “but a big push on the
part of students is needed to reach
the goal.”

Contributions have been re-
ceived from the Dental School
and the Freshman class of the
Medical school. The Medical frosh
donated $50, and each student
from the Dental school gave $1.

The service fraternity, Alpha

SC Committee To Investigate
All Student Governing Bodies;
‘Improved Operations’ Sought

. By MILLARD AMDUR
Student Congress announced at their weekly meeting
Monday, Nov. 5, formation of a committee, the purpose of
which is to examine the existing student governmental bodies
at the University and their relationship to one another, and
to suggest possible improvement for more relationship to

one another, and to suggest possible improvement for more
effective operation of the groups}

Dave Bender, Col. ’57, president
of SC, says of the committee that
“it should be able to deﬁne the
areas in which WSGA, SC, and
Men’s Council operate and to sug-
gest some concrete proposals
_through the implementation of
which we may improve our stu-
dent government.”

‘ Chairman of the committee is
Irv Rothman, Col. ’57. Under
him are four undergraduates,
one alumnus, and two members
of the faculty. Carol Fine, Col.
’58, Karen Maegerlein, Col.’ ’58,
Bob Lancaster, ‘Bus. Ad. ’57,
and Tom Tarolli, Eng. ’57, are
the four undergraduate mem-
bers of the committee. Bob Dick-
inson, past ODK man of the
year, is serving as the alumnus;
Dr. Edward Cooke of the politi-
cal science department and Miss
Emily Irvine are the faculty
representatives. “ .

Rothman, when asked about the
function of his ‘committee, stated:
“The committee will progress
quickly but logically, considering
carefully the value and merits of
all student government organiza-
tions now in existence at the Uni-
Versity, in the hope that we may
recommend to the student body

the means to make our student

body more functional.”

He makes clear that no de-
cision made by the committee
will be binding to the govern-
mental organizations. Bender
asserts that, should any import-
ant change be suggested by the
group, MC and WSGA will be
presented with the proposals for
their  consideration. .

M a n y administration ofﬁcials
have expressed the belief that
changes are necessary in the or-
ganization of student government
at the University. This committee
will endeavor to search out a
feasible solution to the problem.
The work of the committee will
be complete by January.

Howie Rossen, Col. ’58, moved
and congress passed that SC
should appoint a committee to
work with staff in editing and
distributing the 1937-58 Polaris.
and that the editors and busi-
ness managers should appoint
the editors and business man-
agers of the publication. - ,
Robert McCabe, Col. ’57, was put
in charge of a group to set up _a
workable plan for the establish-
ment of an SC Judicial Commis-

sion.

    YWCA   I l)irectIor Tells

oint Office Brings
‘New. Cooperation’

To Group Efforts
By .DAVID BREAKSTONE

YWCA has been moved
from the twelfth ﬂoor and
now occupies offices adjoin-
ing the YMCA on the eighth
ﬂoor. The change has been
successful according to Miss

Olga’ Krill, new director of the
“Y” who said, “We are enjoying

"“‘-he new cooperative effort.”

Miss Krill is a Pitt alumna who

r. .1 today admitsshe came to Pitt ten

years too soon. The new YWCA
director talked excitedly about
the .great changes which Pitt is
undergoing and how her new or-
ganization will be affected by
them. She comes to Pitt after‘ a
brief occupancy as an elementary
school teacher.

Miss Krill became interested
‘in guidance and received
master's degree in that ﬁeld at
evening school. “When the op-
portunity to return to my Alma
'_Mater occurred, I jumped at

I  the chance,” she said.

It is hard to get Olga Krill to
talk about herself for whenever
~h‘er train of thoughts heads to-
ward “Y” activities, she invari-
ably begins talking about “her.
kids” —- the ‘Y’ members.

“Her kids” work in a beehive
of activity. As part of the ‘.‘Y”
object of social responsibility, a
Halloween party for under-
privileged children was held.

The four major ideas of the
YWCA, acording to Miss Krill,
are Christian heritage, social re-
sponsibility, world relatedness,

and personal and campus related-
ness. ‘

Out of these abstractions have
come such tangibles as U.N.
Week, a campus program which
has included district high school
participation, Caritas, and the
new faculty -—— student discussion
groups. ’

About this last activity Miss
Krill seems particularly enthusi-
astic. This idea corresponds to the
new direction on the campus, she
said. “The plan,” Miss Krill con-
tinued, “has the tendency to bring
unity and friendliness to an urban
college.”

  Poetry Picking:  

A program was launched at the University last Thurs-

day with theaim of beneﬁting all students in the school

whether they be engineering or English Majors. Pitt’s Poetry
Reading series, sponsored‘ by the Humanities Society, has
outlined a series of discussions for the purpose of “making
available to the student body a living contact withthe
world’s great literatureff The group last semester proved
itself one of the most successful of its type and for that
reason was asked to be continued this year. I .

The program is offering a variety of discussions. Par-
tial plans include a reading of parts of “The Divine Come-
dy,” the‘ love letters offulane Welsh and Thomas Carlyle, a
discussion of poetry and art, and a reading of poetry from

the Bible. These subjects, being led by outstanding mem-

bers of the faculty, should make ,a highly informative and
interesting session.

. The series has been planned not only to supplement
coursesbeing taken by the English majors in the Univer-
sity but also to beneﬁt students who are not able to work’
into their schedules the English coursesoffered by the De-
partment. The series is not meant to duplicate that which
is ‘being taught in the classroom, but instead to have a

distinction all its own in acquainting the student with out-

standing works of both English literature and foreign litera-
ture. Certainly, one of the most unique features of the en-
tire‘ program will be the presentation of bilingual readings.

A committee of faculty members has been appointed to

They include Ruth Haun, assistant professor of speech; W. A

George Crouch, chairman of the English Department;
Michael McHale, assistant professor of speech‘ and director

of Pitt Players; Putnam Jones, dean of graduate faculties;
’ Lorena Garloch, University libr_arian; William C. Panetta,»

assistant professor of Classics; George B. Fowler, professor
of history ,and Jack Kolbert, assistant professor of modern‘
languages.

The next meetings for this group will take place every
Thursday——with the exception of today’s-at 3:30 pm, in
the Aldred Room. The students attending these meetings

will in every sense of the word be rewarding themselves.

The Suez: A _Question  V. 

Usage And pUsulrp,al’rion

By Irv Rothman V
That the Egyptian government is entitled to
ownership of the Suez Canal is indisputable. But
the manner in which Nasser has taken over owner-

‘ : ship of the Canal is the issue in the current Middle

East crisis. - -
In November 1854 the Viceroy of Egypt and
Mr. Ferdinand de Lesseps signed the basic agree-
ment for the Construction and 
Operation of the Suez, Canal j,
which was to last for, a period
of 99 years, beginping with the
date of the opening of the canal 
between the Red Sea and the _
Mediterranean sea.

The Canal was opened in
November ’17, -1869. Thus, in
November 1968 the Egyptian
Government, under international

   
   

 

agreements could legally take over “all its rights T

without reservation and shall enter into full pos-
session of, the canal between the two seas . .‘ .”
Impatient Nasser I

But Nasser could not wait those twelve years.
His reign exists only upon his ability to show
Egyptian leadership and to assert Egyptian strength
in the Middle East. When the opportunity arrived
for him to drive British and French inﬂuences out
of the Suez Canal area, he quickly jumped at it.

For almost a year, Nasser negotiated with the
United States for economic support for the Aswan
dam project on the Nile which would ultimately
have increased land productivity, so he claimed.
But U.S. government .researchers discovered that
the Nasser dam provisions were not adequate for
the growing need of the country. A ’

Nasser had asserted throughout the agreements
that it had received lower bids for the project from
the Soviet Union, claims which laterlproved un-
founded. Calling his bluff after realizing the proj-
ect impractical, the United States withdrew its
offer. -
Violation in Retaliation

In retaliation, Nasser seized the assets of the
Suez Canal Company and claimed it free and sov-
ereign for the Egyptian government. By this move,
he violated the contract of 1854. ~

That which challenged the Western World was
the refusal of the head of a sovereign state to
honor economic contracts -made under the inter-
national law. This was the only basis for argu-
ment. -

The failure of Great Britain, France, and th
United States government to realize the crux of
the situation’ and the terms of Nasser’s violation
threw the whole Middle East crisis into a furor with
Nasser in command and Russia behind him one-

as they.were concerned after the failure of the
Users’ Association, sent troops and planes to pro-
tect their interests in the Middle East, for no other
plan had been offered either through the United
Nations or through the United States.

‘Seeking Stars

Toward the end of October Nasser had gained
prestige i.n the Arab‘ countries; with the West split
he turned to his second troubleybspot, the States of
Israel. In the excitement of the Canal seizure, the
Egyptian government had eased up its commando
attacks in the Gaza strip; but with conﬁdence never
higher, Nasser set into motion his plan to unite
the_ Arab nations with he as leader.

Syrian forces moved into Jordan gnd the Egyp-
tian armies 'moVed into the Gaza strip encircling
the Sinai peninsula. Of course, since the 1949
Armistice agreement Arab troops had been at-
tacking Israel and there had been retaliation raids
on the part of the Jewish State.

Surrounded by an Arab pincer movement, Israel
had no choice but to act quickly. Premier David
Ben-Gurion mobilized forces and last week the
Israelis thrust into Egypt.

Israel, with its back to the sea, quickly de-
falted dictator Nasser. And the armaments Israel

I was not able to obtain from Western nations be-

cause of varied boycotts and United States pres-
sure for defense, it obtained from ﬂeeing Egyptian
troops——Russian tanks and Russian ammunition.

‘ Allied Attdcks  

Almost immediately after the Israeli attack,
French and the British attacked Cairo, in an at-

tack probably aligned with the Israeli thrust al-_

though such claim cannot be based on fact. How-
ever, Israel was in little position to refuse any
such offer. We are not sure what the British and

.French can cl.aim as their excuse for attacking

but to protect the private interests of their in-
dividuals and the assets of individuals in the coun-
try.

But we cannot see hasty; and unenlightened con-
demnation of the State of Israel in the United
Nations. The Israeli thrust may more easily be
considered retaliation in light of the fact that since
the inception of the State of Israel the Arab coun-
tries have been warring with it.

The plurality of Arab states have not even

‘recognized Israel as a State although an Israeli

representative sits in the United Nations.
Today victorious Israeli armies in the Sinai

Peninsula and Britain’s bombing of Cairo becloud

the original issue of Nasser’s wanton seizure of
the Canal in” violation of international law. As
long as that issue is not considered, then French
and Britishattack is aggression. But when we con-
sider the brash policies and lustful hopes of Nasser

then Israel, Britain, and France have only retali-

ated.

College Press Freedom

 

By Gordon Clowney
A college newspaper exists for
two main reasons. It’s ﬁrst pur-
pose‘ is to keep the student body
informed, and the second, to
provide an outlet for the crea-
tivity and opin-
ions of those-
students, who
wishing to ex-
. tend their edu-
cation beyond
the classroom
see ﬁt to spend
their time and
energies work
ing on such a
publication.
Even though
the actual writ-
ing, layout, and in some cases

I even the printing is done by the

students, there A remains the
question as to who should have
the ﬁnal say about what ma-
terial should or should notbe
incuded in the paper. In other
words, should a college paper be
censored, and, if so, by whom
and to what degree? This is a
perpetual question on college
campuses throughout‘ the coun-
try each year.

There exists two schools of
thought on this problem. Some
educators believe, that if ﬁe
paper is entirely or partly sup-
ported by an allocation of stu-
‘dent funds, members of the ad-
ministration, through such chan-
nels as a publications board, or

student faculty advisor, have the ,

right to guide student policy ‘on

controversial ‘issues. This line of ~
reasoning points out that if a

 

 

college or university is perform-
ing the duties of publisher,
meaning .to supply the paper
with necessary funds, then it
also has the corresponding right
to dictate editorial policy.

Mr. Robert U. Brown, Presi-
dent and Editor of “Editor and
Publisher,” and an outstanding
proponent of censorship, in cases
where the paper is connected
with the university, says in, a
recent article appearing in his
magazine, that “the Constitu-
tional guarantee of a free press
gives us all the right to use a
printing press to express our
views. We either can buy one
or hire one to have our say. But
it doesn’t give us the right to
use someone 'else’s printing press
indiscriminately without permis-
sion. -

Give Editors Authority

While technically Mr. Brown
is correct in’ stating that pub-
lishers have the right to dictate
editorial policy, student editors,
if properly selected, should have
thegright to dictate the editorial
policy of their respective publi-
cation.”

After all -when you come
right down to it, the job of the
student paper, just as the job
of the city paper, is to (1) pre-
sent the news as it happened,
and (2) to comment on said
news, both by column, which re-
present one person’s viewpoint,
and by editorials, representing

‘the combined attitudes and opin-

ions of the editorial staff.

So why allthe "fuss about cen-
sorship, if the facts are straight,

   

and the criticisms or evaluations
well thought out, columns and
editorials can do no more than
provide food for thought. Com,-
bined with news stories, and the
experience and ‘judgement of the
individual reader, they merely
offer the opinion of an indivi-
dual, or group of individuals
which can be either accepted or
rejected, according to the read-
ers own opinions, or thoughts on
the matter in question. ‘
Reader Should Think ’

In other words, they are not
published as the gospel on the
subject, but merely in an at-
tempt to arouse interest and stir
the reader to think for himself.

“Dwight Bentel, of the Uni-

 

versity of Texas, Journalism De- ‘M

partment, in an article appear-
ing in the April 14, issue of
“Editor and Publisher,” pretty
well sums up the case for college
press freedom. 7
Says Mr. Bentel,
cial considerations that enter in
to the freedom.of the campus
newspaper are educational. It is
not the purpose of a college or

“Thine spe-

university to restrict student V A

thinking or restrain its out-
spoken expression. It is not the
purpose of a college or univers-
ity to condition the country’s
future pewspapermen to accept-
ance of authoritarian control of
the press.” ’ .

“It (the paper) exists on the
campus as Part of the educa-
tional program, and it serves its

purpose educationally ‘when it

permits free

editorial expres-
sion.” I ‘ ‘

Says ‘Americans
Are Treated Well
If They Behave’

By SUE GOTTERER.

“If an American behaves
himself in Europe, he will _be
treated well. Anyone who
looks for trouble can ﬁnd it
wherever he goes,” said Lt.
Col. George E. Weigand,

Col. Weigand, assistant profes-
sor ofVAir Science and Tactics,
has spent much time in Europe in
"the Air Force. He has traveled
from Norway to Istanbul.

Col. Weigand says that there

I’ is no general feeling toward the

U.S. in Europe. Norway tolerates
the Americans while Denmark
couldn’t care less. West Germany
is rather friendly to Americans.
In Paris the feeling is against
the Americans. It is there that
signs saying “Go Home” are
posted. In England the relation-
ship depends on the class of the
individual with whom one
comes in contact.
In Rome and Naples the people
are very happy to see the Amer-
ican soldiers. \

In Turkey, according to C01.

' Weigand, the people are pleasant

and nice to get along with. In
Instanbul one Turk, who spoke
excellent English, showed him
through the Oriental
and other parts of the city.

The vast majority of the
Turks are illiterate. Col. Weig-
and explains that they carry on
their business by means of pub-
lic stenographers. Each stenog-'
rapher has a bridge table,
chair, and typewriter. They sit
in rows on the street and write
letters for a fee. Some of the
more afﬂuent have offices.

Col. Weigand, entered the Air
Force 39 years ago. He served one
year in France and then served
with the Army of Occupation in
Germany. After that he went to

In Final Dual Meet

On Friday afternoon, at 3

compete in their ﬁnal dual
meet ‘of the season when they

over the ﬁve—mile Schenley 1°ark
course. The meet will be the Blue
and Gold's ﬁnal competition be-
fore the IC4A championship meet
in New York on Nov. 19.

The Panthers, who have yet to
lose this season, are being coach-
ed by Carl Rees who has taken
over for Carl Olson, the Olympic

I bound track and - cross-country

mentor. i

The all-winning hill and dalers,
however, may be in for their
toughest test of the season in fac-
ing Chick Werner’s Penn State
Lions.

Moore Injured

The Oaklanders were supposed
to have-run a dual meet with
Army last Friday, but suffered
food poisoning when they reached
West Point, and the meet had to
be cancelled.

The illness not only cost the
Panthers some top-notch com-
petition, but also left them in
a weakened physical condition
from which several, notably
Vince Timon, have yet to re-
cover. Adding to the woe of
Coach Rees, Jimmy Moore, one
of the Blue and Gold’s best and
most consistent performers, is
still suﬁering from a groin in-
jury that has reduced his ef-
fectiveness.

Not only will the locals be in
poor physical condition, but, in

Panther Triumph V
Would Give Irish
Worst Grid Chart

Before the 1956 fotball season
began, reports had it that Coach
Terry Brennan was deviating
from the policies of former coach
Frank Leahy. Brennan was going
to attempt to win against the
powers by recruiting only local
South Bend material. "

The talent-laden high schools
of Western Pennsylvania, which
had contributed so much to Notre
Dame grid success in the past,
were going to be disregarded
whenever Notre Dame wanted a
top-flight football player.

This is Brennan’s third year
at the helm of the Fighting Irish
who are realy ﬁghting this year
-—ﬁghting their worst season in
history. A

If the Panther gridders can beat
the South Benders this Saturday
at the Stadium, they will inflict
the sixthiloss of the season on the
Irish record. This would be the
most number of defeats ever ex-
perienced by a Notre Dame team
from its ﬁrst season of football
which dates back to 1887.
Maybe Brennan should recon-
sider Western Pennsylvania ma-
terial? .

‘ Armed with a new offense

and renewed life, the bruised

and battered Panther soccerites are getting set for their
toughest physical test of the year, a weekend trip into the
neighboring state of Ohio where they will meet Ohio State

and Denison on successive days. 6

On Friday the locals will be at
Columbus for an important tussle
with the Buckeyes, and then they
will take the short jaunt to Gran-
ville to meet the Big Red of Den-

Reginella was sidelined with an

is expected to be ready as is Bill

I The Panthers faced both of
this weekend’s opponents in
1955, winding up victorious in
each. They shut out Ohio State,

. 1-0, and downed Denison, 3-1.

Bemis is looking forward to
rough games with the pair,
“We beat Ohio State,
last year by playing our best
game,” he claims. “The Buck-
eyes are a passing team, and
that is the type of offense that
has given us the most trouble.”

Speaking of the Big Red, Bemis
says, “Besides the fact that they
have a good team, they will have
an advantage physically since we
play them on the second day. We
will probably be especially slow
in the first quarter.”

work. Sepsi, who scored three
touchdowns and completed ﬁve
of seven passes, refused to bask
in his glory. “It’s not hard to
run behind blockers like Curt
Plowman,” he said.

If it was possible to set this
spirit down on paper, names like
Bob Rathi, Dave Helsel, Chuck
Marranka, and Bob Longfellow,
fellows who make a habit of play-
ing 60 minutes, Nort Seaman, who
played the last two games with a
sore sohulder, Ivan Toncic, who
returned from the hospital to play
the second-half against Navy,
and many more would fill the
page.

Could Press’ Varsity

But this spirit cannot be seen-
it can only be felt. As Petro puts
it, “.The coach can only lead and
encourage", but its up to the play-
er whether he will produce or
not.”

Petro, Dick Deitrick, and Rudy
Mattioli have led and encouraged
and the squad ﬁnally produced.
Next year is another story. With
the varsity hard hit by gradua-
tion, there is a good chance that
a lot of these boys will see ac-
tion. It may even be that some of
the varsity will be pressing them
for a position. .

Waving ﬂags and declaring
emphatically that it wasn’t a

reverently_ﬁled their way into

Butchock, Wiley, Jelic, Koltiska,
and a quivering, shivering Ray.

The Loyal Order of Seers also

was amendment 22-B to the

“The Game of the Weak”
ﬁnds the Redlands Bulldogs
playing the San Dimas Broncos
in the battle for ﬁrst place in the
Roughrider Conference. So far
both of these mighty powers are
undefeated, untied and unscored
upon.

In fact the Redlands have
such an amazing defense that in

the ﬁrst nine games they have
held the opposition to no gains
through the air lanes. Their
looping-blooping line not only
stops the ground game, but
sieves passes out of the air like
a magnet picking up tacks.

Says Ray: “I’m banking on
the Redlands.”

This week’s guest from the
football team is fullback Ralph

Herman Canil who came up
with a 3-7 slate last week.

Seventeen commercial and military models of aircraft are in
production at Lockheed. '

Development projects are even more diversiﬁed, include

jet and propjet transports, ﬁghters and bombers far exceeding
present—day planes in performance, radar search planes,
nuclear applications to aircraft and a number of signiﬁcant
classiﬁed activities.

This capacity to develop and produce such a wide range of
aircraft is important to career-conscious engineers. It means
more scope for your ability, more opportunity for promotion
with so many projects in motion. It means more security-—-
because your career is not restricted to one type of plane.

mus ANDREWS my.-

‘Wérzly, o Professor Ygg/723
among wogozz°nes./ ”

Julie Andrews, twenty-one-year-old British girl, plays Eliza
Doolittle in the sensational Broadway success "My Fair Lady"
-—a musical adaptation of Gedrge Bernard Shaw's “PygmaIion."

11- Miss Andrews, had you ever been away from yourfamily betore you
arrived in this country two years ago?

I. Never, and I still becomedreadfully homesick. But I do talk with them

several times a week. i

Q. By phone? A

A- No-—byl phonograph. We talk into recording machines, and airmail the
records. They are so clear I can even hear my brothers arguing in the back-
ground about whose turn is next. It is as if we were all in one room.

'\i\

Q. You never exchange the usual kind of letter?

A. Very seldom, I ’m afraid. But we post back and forth bits of particular
interest—like newspaper reviews, and favorite articles from The Reader's

Q- Just the Digest?

A. Oh, no, there are others sometimes-but the Digest is our magazine.
Mummy and Daddy have always read it, and I began when I was twelve,
playing music halls. I had to miss school, and my teaching governess went
through every issue with me on the run. It was partof my lessons.

* Q. Do you still read it on the run?
A. Oh, yes—waiting for assignments, waiting for buses, even waiting for
curtain cues. I hope I never have to be without it. When I wish to be

amused,.the Digest amuses me; and when I need to be scolded or instructed,
I can always ﬁnd an article that talks to me like-—

0- Like a Dutch uncle?

A. No, much more delightfully—more like Professor ’Iggins in “My Fair
Lady” showing a new world to Eliza Doolittle.
