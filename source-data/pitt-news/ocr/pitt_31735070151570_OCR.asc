AE:-3°E Editor

A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh has in-

dicted an Oakland man on two charges of

violating narcotics laws.

According to court documents, Car-
melo Rojas-Perez, 31, was in possession
of about a kilogram of methamphetamine
smuggled to him from Mexico. The drug
was allegedly hidden within the frame of a
religious picture, according to a statement
U.S. Attorney for the Western District of
Pennsylvania David Hickton’s office re-
leased Wednesday.

If Rojas-Perez is found guilty of the
charges, he could face a minimum sen-
tence of 10 years in prison. The maximum
sentence for the crime is‘ life in prison in
addition to a $10 million ﬁne. A

Rojas-Perez was arrested at his home
on the 300 block of Atwood Street.

The statement from Hickton’s ofﬁce
did not indicate the date Rojas-Perez was
arrested.

The investigation leading to the indict-
ment against Rojas-Perez was conducted
jointly by Homeland Security Investiga-
tions and U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection.

Neither Rojas-Perez nor Hickton’s ofﬁce .

could be reached for comment. I

Chancellor Nordenberg, along with
other University administrators, hon-
ored late Pitt alumnus Wangari Maathai
on Wednesday by planting twinred ma-
ple trees, representing her dual roots
that grounded her in both Pittsburgh
and Kenya.

The circular garden in which the

trees now reside symbolizes her global

vision of preserving the environment
and empowering women and children.
In the center, a small tree is planted,
Nordenberg said, to represent the

idea that one small seed can change '

the world.

About 40 people, including members A

of the Pitt community and of Maathai’s
family, sat outside of the Cathedral of
Learning’s Fifth Avenue entrance to see
University officials dedicate a plaque

and the garden to the late Nobel Lau-

Maathai, who was born in the vil-

in 1960 as part of then-U.S. President

Pitt, Maathai launched into social, po-
litical and environmental activism in
Kenya. This led to sustainable living
for women and childre-n alike and had
a lasting e'ffe_ct on environmental con—
servation.

Alice Kindling, a member of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees, recalled her interac-
tions with Maathapi. '

“As dynamic'of a speaker she was, she
was ten times dynamic of an individual,”
Kindling said.

Maathai is widely recognized as the
leader of the Green Belt Movement, an
organization that she established in Ke-
nya in 1977. The movement focuses on
community empowerment and educa-

spread to many African villages since
its creation. It has been successful in
revitalizing hundreds of economies.
In his speech, Nordenberg said that
Maathai’s years of research in Kenya
spurred her development of an econom-
ic model for African villages. The plan
consisted of planting trees in order to
sustain land. Then, the trees would yield

« crops, bring income to the small villages

and supply wood, fodder, fencing, shade
and, in some cases, nutritious food.
Maathai recognized that trees-‘had the
potential to heal the land and bring birds
and small animals into the ecosystem.
Nordenberg described this process as
having the ability to “regenerate the
vitality of the earth.” , V V

audience how she views the University
of Pittsburgh as one of her homes.

“Pittsburgh taught me to not waste
any opportunity, to do what can be
done. And there is a lot to do,” Norden—
berg recalled Maathai saying.‘

For Humphrey, the meaning of the
garden transcends its physical appear-
ance.

“For some it will just look like a

much more. For me, they are a symbol

critical article

I Cristina Holtzer ;
Stqff Wrz'ter

Abigail Salisbury is an enemy of the

state of Ethiopia because of an op—ed .

column she published online.
Salisbury, a student in the Gradu-

‘ ate School of Public and International

Affairs, spoke about her article to an
audience of about 10 in a “Let’s Talk
Africa” lecture on Wednesday in 4130
Posvar Hall from 1:30 to 3 p.m. The
Ethiopian government blocked her ar-
ticle, titled “Human Rightsand the War
on Terror in Ethiopia,” one day after
she published it online.

While in Ethiopia, Salisbury no-
ticed an extreme lack of freedom of
speech and press for Ethiopian people
and decided to write the piece, which
criticizes the Ethiopian government.

Salisbury was working as an assis—'
tant professor at Mekelle University
Law School,‘a small college outside of
Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia,
when she published the article. After
the university administration discov-
ered her article, Salisbury said the

university “basically asked [her] not I

to work there anymore.” .
“I was told that, based on what I

' wrote, that if I had been an Ethiopian

person, I would have been put in pris-
on,” Salisbury said. “I don’t think they
want me back.” '
Ironically enough, Salisbury said,
she was in the country teaching inter-
national human-rights law, a class re-
quired for graduation from law school
in Ethiopia. .
Anna—Maria Karnes, a representa-
tive of the Africana studies department,
also attended the lecture and interject-

ed throughout. Karnes, whose parents
live in Ethiopia, has a thorough grasp
of the political climate in the country.

“Skype was outlawed two years ago
in Ethiopia,” Karnes said. “There were
people jailed for using Skype.”

When Karnes first discovered the
Skype law, she worried that she would
not be able to get in touch with her par-
ents because that was their primary
source of communication. But Skype
was illegal only for Ethiopians, not for
foreigners.

“As a Westerner, you are treated dif-
ferently,” Salisbury said. “Better.”

Ethiopians subscribe to a differ-
ent race and caste system than many
Americans are used to. Salisbury said
that when African-Americans traveled
to Ethiopia, they were treated the same
as whites. Ethiopians believe that every-
one else in Africa is black but that they,
themselves, are red skinned.

Salisbury recounted a story of when
someone in the street approached her
and asked, “Have you seen any black
women today‘.3”

Salisbury said she was surprised by
the scale of differences between the
learning environments in Ethiopia and
the U.S.

Because of the country’s limited re-
sources, students learn to memorize
verbatim what professors say in lec-
ture. Salisbury said she’s seen students
reproduce a lecture right down to the
“ums” and “likes.” f "

Ethiopian education also differs
from Western education because, Salis-
bury said, there could be “watchers”
present at any time, in any classroom.
Watchers are government representa-
tives on the lookout for those speaking
out against the government.

“Whatwould creep me out if I were
in that class?” Salisbury said. “I don’t
know if I would be raising my hand with
opinions.”

In addition to an extreme lack of

freedom of speech, Salisbury said Ethi-
opians also struggle with tough racial
tensions and “ethnic federalism,” or
preferential treatment for one ethnic

group that is ofﬁcially recognized by
the government. With Ethiopia locat-
ed in a contentious part of the world,
Salisbury said U.S.-Ethiopia relations
are crucial.

“Ethiopia is really instrumental in
the U.S. agenda and the global war on
terror that we’re engaged in,” she said.

Salisbury and Karnes opened the
presentation with an activity about
African knowledge. They divided the
audience into small groups and asked
them to label a map of Africa with the

one was able tolabel the entire map.

“You can’t know the whole of Africa,”
Director of Africana Studies Macrina

If those extraterrestrials

realism in the ﬁlm certainly adds to the
interest level and relatability that a lot of
suspense crime dramas lack.

The ﬁlm deals with a horror that every
parent prays they will never have to expe-

rience. Amazing performances by Jack-
man, Terrence Howard (D oVer’s neighbor)
and their wives — played by Maria Bello
and Viola Davis —— perfectly display the
emotions of grieflstricken parents. The
helplessness of the characters is very real,
allowing the audience to empathize with
them throughout the ﬁlm.

The majority of the plot hinges on '

Dover’s search for his daughter. Slightly
unstable after her disappearance, Dover
tries to blame both Detective Loki and
Jones for why his daughter has yet to be

On Nothing W/as the Same, Drake displays lyrical depth

Jeff Ihaza

Nothing Was the Same
A-

Sounds like: Driving along Highway _
59 in Houston. Alone. Thinking about
“her.” ’

“Dropped the mixtape, that sh*t sounded
like an album” Drake boasts on the lyri-
cally lopsided posse cut “Forever.” When
“Forever” was released, Drizzy was still
shaking off his Degrassi background and
disses aimed at the fact that his name is
Aubrey. At the time, his breakthrough mix-
tape, So Far Gone, was getting unprec-
edented radio play and was even being
sold at Borders (R.I.P.). The 22-year-old
child star had plenty to boast about. His
signature voice inundated the radio, and
it seemed like he was only getting started.
Now, nearly four years after the release of

n*gga gonna spend on the intro?” that we
get on the bass-heavyiend of the opening
track, “Tuscan Leather,” is representative
of where Drake is as an artist. He’s made
every right decision, so much so’ that the
perils of seemingly bad moves are innately
apparent. That’s where the brilliance of

_ Nothing was the Same comes’ from: Drake

is in on the jokes.

Take the outright gender—ﬂipping “Wu-
Tang Forever.” Aside from an almost indis-
tinguishable Raekwon vocal sample, the

song is the exact opposite of a Wu—Tang

cut (Inspectah Deck is none too happy
about it, either). Instead of head-busting
violence, we get Drake offering himself up
to'a past lover a la Rihanna’s “Only Girl (In
the World).” His crooning is borderline
uncomfortable, but irresistible in perhaps
the oddest way. By the time the song segues
into “Own It,” the inclination to skip the
pillow talk is gone and you’re awoken from
a trance with a sly jab from Drake.

“I swear n*ggas talk more than b*tches

these days,” he reminds us, blurring the
line between femininity and the stereo-
typical machismo of the hip-hop world.

Much should also be said about the
immaculate production on the record.
Tracks blend together seamlessly like a
vinyl, and as a project, Drake rejects the
instant-gratiﬁcation, Vevo—centric man-
ner of production, instead working for
something complete that begs to played
from start to ﬁnish. _

The bona ﬁde hit “Hold on We’re Going
Home” feels like a crackly vinyl classic by
the likes of Curtis Mayﬁeld or Whitney
Houston, both of whom are sampled as
bookends to the album. The song hop-
scotches on a Miami Vice drum pattern
that beats out Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” as
the song your parents will dance to at your

wedding. The cheesy bar mitzvah feel of

the song somehow works to Drake’s advan-
tage. It’s infectiously treacly and he knows

Lil Bub, Colonel Meow and
the rise of the cat celebrity

September 26, 2018 I The Pitt News | vwvvv.pitmevvs.cem

Kayla Sweeney
WPTS Contributor

It wasn’t too long ago that the funniest thing
on the Intemetwas awebsite full of pictures of
cats with blockywhite text plastered on them,
saying hilariously human and grammatically
incorrect things (because they’re cats, get it?).
The website I Can Has Cheezburger blew up, to
the point where a television show (that would
later fail) was created about the behind—the—
scenes of the website. -
Despite the intemet’s undeniable love of
cats, the cat—loving masses have today gone
elsewhere, and memes no longer hold the
crown of intemet cat royalty. That title be-
longs to modern cat celebrities —~ cats who
are impressive and individualistic enough to
generate their own devoted following and
sometimes even generate their own income.
Take Lil Bub, for example. She’s atwo-year-
old cat with a deformed lower jaw, enlarged
eyes and a bad case of osteopetrosis. She also
has over 22,700 followers on Twitter, her own
clothing line and aVice-magazine-made docu-

In the competitive world of celebrity cats, Lil Bub is the undisputed champ.

mentary. The documentary, called “Lil Bub
and Friendz,” also features the likes of Grumpy
Cat —— perhaps Lil Bub’s more famous coun-
terpart — and Colonel Meow, a consistently
angry—looking gray furball of a cat.

This documentary marks an important
milestone in the history of Internet cats. For
the ﬁrst time, people care who these animals
are. They follow their every move through
various social-media outlets, they stop on the
street when they see these animals walking
from various meet—and—greets and they wear
their faces on T-shirts, sellingtheir images to
the world.

So what changed?As with many things, we
mostly have social media to blame. Yes, we had
things like YouTube back inthe “Cheezburger
Era,” but the trend of the erawas quantity, not
quality. These cats, albeit ﬁmny, were essen-
tially anonymous. This marks a huge change
from today, where the cats are characters we
know and love. Thanks to new social-media

“Anticipation has a habit to set you up for
disappointment.”

That was front man Alex Tumer’s open-
ing line on Arctic Monkeys riveting debut LP,

, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m

Not. Little did he know how prophetic that
line would be for the career of the undeniably
promising yet somewhat mercurial British
rockers. After setting the bar high with its
2006 debut and stellar 2007 follow up, Fa-
vorite Worst Nightmare, the band decided
to undergo a serious shift in its sound over
the next six years that has made many lis-
teners scratch their heads in confusion. For

fans of the indie—rock outﬁt’s obstinate, hard— ,

drinking early years, it felt as though 'I‘urner
and company had lost their way.

On AM, the band takes this shift to new lev-
els, shedding any semblance of the ﬁ1n—loving
group of rapscallions it once was. Instead,
they’ve discarded their naughty nights for
niceness and produced a collection of slow-
going, sweetly crooned tracks with arena-
rock stylings that are touching at best, boring
most of the time and sickeningly sappy at
their worst. I

The album isn’t without any merit. The
opening two tracks show distinct promise.
On “Do I Wanna Know?” Tumer’s sad—lover

shtick comes across as arrestingly honest.
With lines like, “There’s this tune I found/ that
makes me think of you somehow/ and I play
it on repeat/ until I fall asleep,” he pours his

. heart out over an old ﬂame as the band slowly

adds layer after layer of intensity, without
ever losing theundertones of a sad, drunk
and lonely night. .

“R U Mine?” kicks up the intensity, albeit
with a drop in quality. With driving, slightly
fuzzy guitar riffs and the oft-repeated refrain
of “Are you mine?” Turner and company man-
age to eke out a track that, though it may be
a cookie—cutter radio hit, is at least catchy
and ‘engaging. i

The rest of the album doesn’t fare quite
so well. The band buries their exciting for-
mer selves with languorously slow songs that
somehow still manage to draw from the clas-
sic-rock guitar work of bands like Black Sab-
bath (there’s atinge of “War Pigs” to trackfour,
“Arabella”) and also maintain Alex Turner’s
undeniably sexy vocals with some overplayed
falsetto backing vocals. The result is a confus-
ing blend of styles that, though it can border
on sexy, is more likely to bewilder the listener.

Few of the tracks onithis album are out-
standingly awful; they simply lack the same
sort of brash originality and personality that
was so glaringly obvious on previous Arctic
Monkeys releases. In its place is a mellowed-
out sound that seems content to resemble
poppy tracks from scores of different eras. All
of these are pleasant enough to slot in nicely
on the radio, but none are bold enough to

it. It’s like being on a road trip with Drizzy
and he suddenly pops in George Michael.
Then you realize that you’ve always really
liked George Michael.

For all of its sonic pleasures, Nothing
Was The Same also maintains emotional
density. Drake’s perspective is complex:
Whereas calling out exes on his early mix-
tapes probably felt therapeutic, something
about the jabs on his latest record feels dev-
astatingly lonely. By now the rapper truly
has everything, but if the past four years
have found Drake trying to ﬁll a void, Noth-
ing Was The Same is a strange admission
that emptiness doesn’t disappear when
your life is a completed checklist.

The beautiful track “Too Much” near
the end of the album ﬁnds Drake airing it
all out: the impact of fame on his family
life, isolation from his friends and self-
inﬂicted pressure to be the greatest. -The
song feels like the abstract for the album.
Don’t be fooled by “Started from the Bot-
tom.” For Drake, the metaphorical “here”
is a lonely place. I

platforms such as Instagram and Vine, the
owners of these cats can make accounts that
share more intimate infomiation about these
animals, allowing followers to get to know
them, in a way.

- That-’s the trick to celebrity Internet cats:
By simply subscribing to these animals’ vari-
ous social—mediafeeds, people are essentially
considering these animals apart of their lives.
We’ve created an entirely new class of celeb-
rity, akin to Hollywood stars. One day we very
well may have celebrity-cat paparazzi, as well.

But until that day, you still have some time
to ﬁnd a cat celebrity of your own. Here are
some tips to ﬁnding a ﬁiture cat celebrity:

1. The key is genetic mutations. That
sounds really dark, but it’s true. Grumpy Cat,
Lil Bub, Princess Monster Truck — one thing
they all have in common is that their faces are
messed up. This will set your cat apart from
the rest. Imagine aworld where Grumpy Cat’s
mouth had beenformed inthe right way. How
sad, right?

2. If you can’t ﬁnd a cat with genetic mu-
tations, your next—best shot is to ﬁnd what I

call an Instagram—able cat. These cats tend to
have ﬂat faces, big eyes and super ﬂuffy fur.
They tend to bepopular because of a scientiﬁc
concept known as neoteny. Neoteny describes
adult animals that still appear young (like Lil
Bub). These animals tend to attract humans
due to their nevér—aging cuteness.

3. Make sure you have Twitter, 'Dumblr,
Instagram and Vine accounts for your cat. All
are necessary to increase the exposure of your
kitty. Do not share an account with your cat.
Your cat is the celebrity here, not you.

4. Make friends with another up—and—
coming Internet cat celebrity. The two cats
can easily gain traction using each otl1er’s
fame. This is a cat-eat—cat world, after all. For
example, Smoosh the cat was friends with
Lil Bub, and now that Lil Bub is a celebrity,
Smoosh is famous, as well. You can even-buy
Smoosh and Lil Bub Christmas cards. Now
that’s fame. _

Just remember: Though the economy
might be in shambles, the Internet cat bubble
has yet to burst. So get out there and adopt a
soon—to—be famous cat of your own. I

satisfy fans who are still waiting for the 
to revert to their former brash glory.

If anything really makes this album adisap-
pointment, though, it’s the lyrics. Although his
ﬁrst foray into the role ofheartbroken and sen-
sitive singer is touching, 'I‘umer quickly wears

out his welcome. His voice carries enougg

sensitivity with it to make nearly any line ﬁt for
a bedroom romp, but as the album progresses,
the come—ons get worse and worse, ﬁnally
reaching their low on the last track, “I Wanna
be Yours,” inwhich Turner croons, “I wannabe
your vacuum cleaner/ breathing in your dust.”

It’s hard to listen to AM and not long for the
days when the Arctic Monkeys werethe bards
of drunken Sheffield, England, streets, ﬁ1ri—
ously tearing through raucous adrenaline— and
booze-loaded songs — Turner shooting his
smart mouth off about knackered Conversesn
late night battles with bouncers and brutes
with badges..

As baseball legend Casey “The Old Perfes—

up without growing old.” Arctic, it’s a shame
baseball never caught on across the pond. I

if his acﬁons are a bit extreme.

Villeneuve uses various cinematic strate-
gies to keep the audience in suspense through-
out the ﬁlm. One that is essential, though
which might go unnoticed, is the ﬁlm’s use of
silence. Many of the scenes have no soundtrack
to back the actions of the moment, which is
a brave tactic that is often overlooked, even
when it is successful. The lack of outside noise
creates a slightly uncomfortable environment
for the viewer — perfect for a horror ﬁlm.‘
Additionally, Villeneuve implements the use
of ﬂashlights — the quintessential lighting for
any good horror story — in a few key scenes

to dial up the suspense.

Although other viewers have criticized

 the length of the ﬁlm, I did not feel that the

length wasan issue. Every scene is necessary

 l for building up to an ending thatwill not only
*1 : satisfy the audience, but  also leave it up to

them to decide how it truly ends.
The performances of Jackman and Gyl—

lenhaal make for an incredible movie—going

experience. The juxtaposition of their two
characters — Keller, aﬁrrnly religious, family-
first father, and Loki, a tattoo-covered loner
detective eating by himself on Thanksgiving
-— create a riveting outcome.

A frequently repeated quote in the ﬁlm
that embodies its major themes and plot is:

0 ,“Pray for the best, expect theworst.” Though

revealing any more would spoil the plot, it suf-
ﬁces to say that anyone who sees this ﬁlmwill
not regret it. Now when watching the Oscars
next March, viewers will know what everyone
is buzzing about. Those who do attend should
take Keller’s words to heart: “Be ready” for a
gripping cinematic experience. I

Football: 2-1, 1-1 ACC V .

Pitt football is the only sport to see the

Panthers post a victory in ACC play 4 the

team’s 58-55 victory over Duke Saturday.
The Panthers rang up 598 yards of total
offense and are averaging 40 points per
game after the offensive explosion.

The season took something of a down-

’ . turn right at the start when Pitt lost 41-13

to No. 11 Florida State. Pitt took a 7-0

lead on the game’s ﬁrst drive, but the” ‘

Seminoles dominated the rest of the
way behind 356 passing yards and three
touchdowns from quarterback Jameis
Winston to show Pitt what the class of
the ACC looks like.

The Panthers have a golden opportu-
nity to go above .500 in conference play
when looking at Saturday’s Homecoming
game against Virginia. The Cavaliers (2-1,
0-0 ACC) were chosen to ﬁnish sixth in

the ACC’s Coastal Division in the conferx:

ence’s preseason media poll.

Virginia is one of two teams picked
to ﬁnish behind Pitt this season —— the
Panthers are expected to ﬁnish the sea-
son in the conference’s ﬁfth spot. Duke
sits in last place in the preseason poll.

Pitt’s defense not cause for
concern ust yet

a

v

Lafayette Pitts and the secondary needs time. Sheldon Satenstein |AssistantVisual Editor

Dustin Gablerl 1
Senior Stcyj’ Wrz'ter

Pitt football’s‘58—55 victory over Duke
raised a lot of concerns among fans, and
many called for defensive coordinator
Matt House to be ﬁred only three games
into his career as defensive coordinator.
But this View isn’t based in reality by

 any means.

For one,;House’s tenure has spanned

only three 'galrnes,=which‘ is ,,not'li1early

‘lenoughjof a sample size to justify calls

for his termination. Onanother note,
 it also takes time for agdefense to come
 into its own. ‘

Look no further than the 2012 season,

. when Pitt’sWdefense“ﬁni'shed in the na-
 tion’s top 25 in yards allowed per game. .
 In its first six games last year, the Pitt

defense allowed averages of 25.2 points

per game and 343.5 yards per game and

had eight takeaways. -
Unlike most teams, Pitt had a fairly

balanced schedule in 2012. The Panthers
faced two FCS teams — Youngstown
State and Gardner—Webb —- in the first
half of the season, and ‘saw Big East bot-
tom feeders —— such as Temple and South
Florida — in the second half.

Pitt had future Sugar Bowl champion
Louisville in the first half and national-
title game competitor Notre Dame in

‘ the second.

Chryst’s squad beat two ranked teams
last year — one in each half of the sea-
son. Pitt beat Virginia Tech in the ﬁrst
half and Rutgers in the second half. The
two teams met in a bowl game and the
Hokies won 13-10 in overtime.

With the ﬁrst-half defensive stats in
mind, take a look at what the Pitt defense
did in the second half. It allowed 14.2
points per game, 308.2 yards per game
and 12 forced turnovers. That’s 11 fewer
points per game, approximately 35 fewer

light on the play of a defense that al-
lows its opposition to take many quality
chances at its ﬁnal line of resistance.
Women’s soccer: 4-5-1, 0-4 ACC
Like the men’s contingent, Pitt’s wom-
en’s soccer team is yet to post a victory in
conference play. But the women posted

four wins in non—conference play to at '

least get on the board in that category.

Similarly to the _men’s side, the Pan-

thers were picked to finish last in the
' ACC this season out of the 14 conference
teams;

So far, the Panthers have been shut out
in threeof their four conference games
and own a goal differential of minus-eight
in four games.

Pitt started its conference slate with
back—to—back losses in front of its home
crowd’, losing 3-0 to Boston College in its
ACC debut. The Panthers followed that
with a 1-0 loss to North Carolina State
and then lost 2-0 at Clemson.

Pitt’s best effort came against the na-
tion’s No. 3—ranked team, Virginia, _who
was ranked No. 1 when the Cavaliers

visited Ambrose Urbanic Field this past .

fig-_stfin,i the} preseason ran

weekend. Pitt took a 1-0 lead in the ﬁrst
half, its ﬁrst lead in any conference game.
But that lasted for just 15 minutes,
after which Virginia tiedthe game in the
27th minute and scored twice in the sec-
ond half to put the match away.
It doesn’t appear Pitt has the best

yards per game and four more turnovers.

Now, Pitt does have a new defensive
coordinator this year in House after
Dave Huxtable was more or less shown
the door, but it’s rather common for
offenses to excel early while defenses
struggle.

Continuing with the coaching, it

would be more of a story if the Pitt of-

explosive Wisconsin offenses and is con-
sidered one of col1ege’s premier offen-
sive minds. Also, two of his biggest hires
from his time at Wisconsin are currenfze.
offensive coordinatorjoe Rudolph and
offensive line coachjim Hueber.

After a full offseason to groom Tom
Savage into a big—armed quarterback,
it would be a lot more worrisome if the
Panthers’ offense was struggling. :«;*~<'

rent rate of 41 points per game and 474
yards per game. A dip from there will
still leaye the Panthersin the mid-30s
in points per game and averaging over
350 yards per game.

A good place to dip will be the turn-
overs. Stats and common sense show
that Pitt won’t continue to average 2.3
turnovers per game. .

As those turnovers disappear, the de- '

fense will be placed in less compromis-
ing positions. Pitt’s defense will improve
with better field position.

Currently, Pitt is 102nd out of 123

' in yards per game and 118th in points

per game. The defense will improve. It
almost has to.

If the Panthers can pull together an
average defense, about 25 points per
game, their offense will carry them very

' far.
