Cadet Brigade Not Represented

Kocibues,

“We are not saying that those
people in ROTC aren’t learning
anything but this is not the ques-
tion,” said Ken Holecko. one of
the speakers on the WPGH for-
um concerning ROTC; “Academ-
ic freedom is the main question:
freedom from outside control.
ROTC is not a program of the
University. It is controled by the
Secretary of Defense.” Holecko
went on.

No representative for ROTC‘

was present at the forum. so the
forum was presented as a dis-
cussion. although it was announc-
ed that anyone who felt that they
could present valid points for the
ROTC side was welcome to do so.
The ROTC Brigade did issue a
statement as to why they were
not able to participate in the for-
um. which had been planned to
be a debate. The statement from
Jack Lapietra. president of the
Cadet Brigade Organization of
ROTC said that the organization
regretted not being represented
at the debate, but that they were
not consulted in time and did not
have adequate time to prepare
themselves to discuss the subject
of ROTC. The CBO did offer an
alternate date. Nov. 22. to discuss
the subject.

Holecko said that he was deep-
ly disappointed with the ROTC
Cadet Brigade. but that he would
be willing to meet with them at
any time to discuss the matter.
"ROTC is not just an ordinary
academic department.“ said Hol-

AWS RECEPTION

AWS sophomore class repre-
sentatives will sponsor a wel-
coming reception for the West
Point Cadets. Any girl interest-
ed in serving as hostess may
leave her name in 552 SU. It
will be held in the Commons
Room from 4-6 p.m.

The University Social Commit-
tee passed the long awaited Resi-
dence Hall social rules at a meet-
ing held last Friday.

The new social rules will apply

to all University operated resi-
' dence halls. In presenting recom-
mendations for new dormitory so-
cial rules, Nick Gervase. presi-
dent of Men’s Dorm Council felt
that “the University should get
away from the father image. Stu-
dents have to learn to grow" up
before they get out of college.“
Joni Amdur of Women’s Housing
Board co-sponsored the recom-
mendations indicating that “wom-
en want more freedom . . . open
houses on weekends . . . and boys

- in their rooms when they like.”

Dorm wide open houses will
now be observed at the following
times: Men’s residence Halls-
Sunday, 2-5 p.m.; Wednesday, 8
p.m.-12:15 a.m.; Friday, 8 p.m.-
2:15 a.m.; Saturday, 2%} p.m. and
8 p.m.-2:15 a.m. Women’s Resi-
dence Halls—Sunday. 2-5 p.m.:

Friday and Saturday, 9 p.m.-1
a.m.

Permission for special ope n
houses may be granted if request-
ed at least 24 hours in advance
from a Resident Assistant.

Sexual activities in violation of
state or local laws will not be
permitted.

Resident students who are 21
years of age or older will be per-
mitted to consume alcoholic bev-
erages in their rooms as long as

they register with the Housing.

Office. These students are per-
mitted to exercise this freedom
as long as they do not allow per-
sons under the legal age to drink.
Use of dormitory house funds for
the purchase of alcoholic bever-
ages is prohibited.

No unescorted men will be per-
mitted in the women’s dorms
above the first floor. Unescorted
women will be permitted in the
lobbies of the men’s dorms only
during an open house. Unescort-

Holecko Attack ROTC a

ecko. “The University does not
control the department.”

Joe Kociubes, the other speak-
against ROTC, brought out the
point that the main argument
ROTC has used to justify its ac-
creditation is that the Undergrad-
uate Council was not fully pre-
pared to make a just decision con-
cerning ROTC, and that ROTC
was not represented on the coun-
cil. “Dean Halliday told Richard
Ross, the ROTC coordinator, that
he could bring any students to the
meeting of the Undergraduate
Council that he wanted,” Kociu-
bes pointed out. “So ROTC did

have the opportunity to be rep-
resented at that meeting where
the decision was reached to take
away ROTC credit.” -

Holecko and Kociubes attacked
ROTC from many sides. “The
professors have no academic free-
dom,” they said. “An ROTC pro-
fessor is.on a tour of duty the
same as if he were stationed over-
seas.” He can be ordered what to
teach. and what not to teach, they
went on. They attacked a resume
from the Military Science De-
partment. which compared ROTC
courses with other courses at the
University. It was brought "out

Despite Laryngitis

that the University, by allowing
credit to exist for ROTC courses.
is in reality allowing the ROTC
student to take a whole term off
from school to get a military com-
mission, for this is what the 14 to
16 credits that a student earned
in ROTC amounts to.

They concluded that ROTC is
not a true University course, and
that “If ROTC is allowed to exist
on campus accredited, businesses
like General Electric should be
allowed to come in and establish
courses since they, too. would be
preparing students for their fu-
tures, like ROTC is doing.”

Audience Entertained By Lettermen

Such cliches as “the show must
go on” came to mind as the Let-
termen performed in concert at
the Syria Mosque before a capa-
city crowd Saturday night.

Letterman Jim. who was suf-
fering from -an acute case of
laryngitis. was unable to sing his
solos and harmony up to par. But
rather than fake their way through
the show. the group explained
Jim's position and more than
made up for his condition with
other solos. comedy. and contact
with the. audience unlike any
concert performers that have play-
ed here before.

Old favorites were sung by the
group after an extended period of
applause brought them back onto
stage for an encore. The applause
was earned by their rendition of

"recent hits. ranging from “Born

Free" to "Light My Fire."

The highlight of the show,
however, came when lead singer
Tony urged the members of the
audience to join him in his part
of “Kansas City.” Many of the

 

amateur. vocalists did quite well.
Two fellows exhibited fine mu-
sical ability, and another indi-
cated that he would reach Kansas
City even if had to take a"‘trip”
to get there. '
The group summed up the show

DESPITE THE fact that Jim

  

l’ImIu by Bob l\m'ni2
( far left) had laryn-
gitis and couldn’t sing as well as usual, the Letter-
men entertained students at the concert Saturday I
night to such an extent that they gave the group a
standing ovation. The group was so pleased with
the audience’s response during their show that they
ended the show by promising that they would re-_
turn when they could sing up to par.

at the end when they said that it
takes a good receptive audience
to make a good show, and the au-
dience was so great that they
hoped they could return h e r e
sometime in t h e future ‘w h e n
their voices were at full strength.

This inquiry would serve as a stu-
dent survey on racist attitudes
here at the University. A variety
of questions were offered as sam-
ples for the questionnaire. The
topics ranged from the student re-
action to -the demands of the
Black Action Society (BAS) to in-
terracial dating. Other questions
dealt with “law and order” and
the role of the white person in the.
racial situation of today. Two of
the proposed questions may reap
some ‘very interesting answers in
thesurvey. One of these is con-
cerned with favorable or unfav-
orable reaction to a request fo_r
all black houses in - the dormi-
tories if such a request were made
by the majority of black students.
The second deals with_the prob-
lem of admitting black students
who don’t meet the regular Uni-
versity requirements.

The group also discussed is-
suance of an official endorse-
ment of the demands of the BAS.
They decided to circualte a peti-
tion among students and faculty

under the direction of Dean of Students Ronald Pease. From
the beginning, Dean Pease and the members of his committee
realized that they had a great task before them.

' ggjwhen. the committee _held its first meeting, its members
came to the astonishing conclusion that there was no all-
encompassing, all-‘ inclusive document of University social
rules. The various social rules have been presented in six
different documents, the Student Handbook, the Guide to
Residence Hall Living, the Housing Contract, the Pitt Woman,
the Interfraternity Council Social Standards, and Univer-

_' sity Housing Office regulations governing Social Events in

Men’s Residence Halls. For the first time these rules were

. consolidated into one package. In the future, the Social Com-

mittee will work to eliminate the ambiguities presented by
the various documents, and to emerge with one clear-cut all-
inclusive list of University Social Rules.

The Social Committee is_ currently involved in an inten-
sive examination of itself, and examination to determine

. what the functions of the group are, or should be, and to de-

termine which groups of students should be represented on
the_Committee.

The‘ Social Committee is currently wondering what
effect all of its work would have if it is subject to the re-
jection of the Assistant Chancellor of Student Affairs. Re-

' presentation on the committee is ‘also in question. The
' group is represented by Associated Women Students and Men’s
- Dormitory Council, but not by their counterparts, Men’s
. Council and Women’s Housing Board. The Committee will

also decide if other groups should have representation.
The Pitt News hopes that the Social Committee will be

A able to solve these problems of organization, purpose, and

equity. In light of their present accomplishments, we feel that
they can. i H

The Social Committee, in a series of lengthy meetings
held during a period of several weeks, was able to approve
significant proposals that were presented by Men’s Dorm

 Council and Women’s Housing Board.

The three most important areas of the new Residence
Hall Social Rules involve open houses, alcoholic beverages,
and privacy. -

The new rules allow for more and longer open houses.

their rooms for the first time. In addition, students are being

. allowed more privacy, such as the right to close or lock the
‘ door when a member of the opposite sex is visiting.

The Pitt News heartily endorses the liberalization of the

Residence Hall Social Rules. We urge Dr. Critchfield to
. ‘ approve this legislation as soon as possible.

If approved the University will have severed many of its
paternalistic bonds. Dormitory residents will be treated on

March to discuss the effects of the dorm laws, we hope that

, the University residents will have acted in a manner of high

responsibility as is dictated by these rules.

 

Twenty-one year olds will be permitted to consume liquor in »

a more adult basis. When the Social Committee meets in.

Fifty years ago today, World War I ended. The
great war, the war to end all wars. it was called:
the war to make the world safe for democracy.

But that was before the second World War. and
that was before Korea, and thank God no one was
taking bets because that was before Vietnam.

Fifty years ago, the names were St, Mihiel.

Belleau Wood, and the Argonne.
Today, the names are Khe Sanh.
Da Nang. Quang Tri. A Shau Val-

i ley. and the Mekong Delta.

THOSE NAMES, the ones that
remind people of death, always
change. But names like John.
Chuck. George. Bernie. Gary.
Tom, and Mike never change.

War, the mighty game, leaves
deep impressions. It scars. And
though one wants and tries to for-

get, there are always the nightmares and the cold

chills of memory.

It’s that way for John. When he returned from A
. the animalistic proving grounds. there was noﬂl
American reality for him. It took him two months
to adjust. to find where he stood. and to realize

he still had a mind.

Two months; he drank because that was a fine
way to forget. Two months; he beat up faggots in
Shadyside becasue he had been taught to kill ugly,

Is ROTC Afraid To Debate?
Maybe . . . It’s Their Breath

by DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

Debates are funny things; it
usually takes two sides to have

one. I went to the Student Union ~

last Friday to hear a two-sided
debate about the ROTC issue that
turned out to be very one—sided.
The reason was the boys from’
ROTC never showed. This was
very unfortunate, because there
was no one around to stifle my
lauthter when.Joe Kociubes quot-
ed a Military Science One text-
book that contained. instructions
to “brush your teeth twice a day”
and “Change your underwear
twice a week.” Hmmmm.

Yet it was A
more than a '
coincidence
that the ROTC
faction was
in i s s i n g .
Throughout
the entire ac- ,
credidation ar-  ~ ._ .  
gllmentv the PTO" ROSENBLUM
ROTC group has been trying to
avoid a debate at all costs. Their
usual reasons are they are two
busy, they have other things to
do, they cannot speak for the en-
tire ROTC program, and other
familiar run-arounds.

But for this particular discus-

_sion, which was sponsored by

WPGH. they came up with some-
thing new. According to Jack
LaPietra. chairman of the
Majority of Concerned Students,
his group was not_consulted when
this meeting was arranged, he
was informed of the forum four
days in advance, he had a busy
weekend (don’t we all), and that
WPGH gave him what amount-
ed to an ultimatum to appear at
the discussion.

LaPIETRA’S EXCUSES ap-

peared feeble at best, but I de-
cided. to check with Jack Tannen-

' baum, Operations Manager of

WPGH, just to make certain
that LaPietra was talking through
his hat. Tannenbaum told me
the following.

“The comments that Jack La-
Pietra made were not quite the
truth. On Nov. 2, La Pietra was

A

    

  
   

only an existence as a part of nothing just as he

Ln:

had known for over a year.

FOR CHUCK and Bernie, the story of trying
to forget is almost the same. Chuck has a mous-
tache now, takes a shot and a beer for supper, and
looks more confident thant ever. His body is one
piece, but he remembers the nights in the jungle,
and that deathly blackness.

Bernie doesn’t talk about it. How does one for-
get the faces of buddies who fall down dead( Now
' he talks of getting married,eand at the same time,
he speaks of his two brothers in tones of fear be-
‘_ cause they enlisted. -

George, an Army journalist. wrote home about
the guys in war. He was on the front alot, and
would bring them things they asked for; ordinary
things like soap and razor blades. Often’ times, as
he has said, “I knew I -would never see them agian.” -

FOR MIKE and Tom, the war goes on. It is still
their life. and as a life, it is a struggle. But it’s a
life that ends too quickly; one that has no goal, and_

accomplishes _really nothing.

‘That’s the way it was for Gary. He didn’t have
to readjust to another life. He didn’t have to worry
about an education, or a career. or a girl. He did-
n’t have problems with this, or troubles with’ that.

For him, life ended. Over there.

ended all wars.

told about tentative plans for a
ROTC discussion that would
take place on Nov. 8. This was a
notice of seven days. Ken Hol-
lecko and Joe Kociubes, who were

going to argue against the ac-.
credidation of ROTC, were also

informed on the same day as La-
Pietra.

As far as an ultimatum being
issued, this is also far from the

_ truth. I spoke with LaPietra and

Dave Ehrenworth on Nov. 4
trying desparately to arrange a
convenient time. However. every
date and time I suggested seem-
ed somehow .inconv'enient.

“THE TRUTH is that WPGH
did not fail to coordinate, but
rather that ROTC failed to co-
operate. Even during the SG
elections, the candidates would'al-
ter their schedules to fit ours,
because they felt it was impor-
tant that the students should

know the issues. Apparently, ROTC
‘ does not share this feeling.”

I must add that I agree whole-
heartedly with Mr. Tannenbaum.
LaPietra has said that he did not
feel that four days notice was
enough time to prepare for a de-
bate. Aside from the fact that
WPGH gave them seven days no-
tice, I took it for granted that

when LaPietra began defending,

the ROTC program, he knew what
he was talking about. ' '

Apparently he felt he was well-
informed when he took his case
to Dr. Peake; he must have pre-
sented valid arguments to our
Provost. They why did LaPietra
say he did not have enough time
to prepare a case‘? Why is he so
desparately trying to avoid a
debate?

It is irrelevent that he had a
busy week-end schedule. If
his facts were organized, it
would have taken him only an
hour to present and -defend
them. And if LaPietra found it
impossible to spare the time, he
certainly could have found two
people from his petition that was
signed by 2300. to defend ROTC.
Or maybe the petition signers
didn’t know the real issues when
they signed.

I

Yes. todayis an anniversary. It is the celebra-
tion of the end of a war 50 years ago. The war that

 

   

LET US NOT be naive enough

to believe LaPietra’s pathetic ex-
cuses. Up until this moment he
has been avoiding a debate be-

cause he is ‘afraid to meet Mr.

Kociubes or Mr. Holecko ‘in any
type of form, discussion, debate.
or any other name you care to
give such a confrontation.

One member of the ROTC
faculty told me that the reason he

opposed a debate was because

speaking ability was an influenc-
ing factor’. Of course it ‘is! It
would be an ideal world if the
facts were able to present them-
selves, but there is no way for this
to happen. This particular fac-
ulty member suggested that some-
one should write questions to C01.
Clagget, who could answer them
in the Pitt News. This would be
fine except for the fact that it
would be impossible to ask ques-
tions about the answers with-
out having a two, to four day,
time lag. This would remove the
continuity of the argument, which
is probably what this faculty
member would like to see.

MR. KOCIUBES has told me
that he would not like to write
any questions to the colonel.
Rather he would like to see the
colonel defend his position
against another faculty member
in an open discussion. But in all
probability the colonel would de-
monstrate the same reluctance
to this idea that LaPietra is de-
monstrating with Kociubes- and
Hollecko. And this is certainly
unfortunate.

LaPietra’s group has scheduled
a forum for Nov. 22. He can be
assured that Mr. Kociubes and
Mr. Hollecko will be there.
I only hope LaPietra’s group
doesn’t have another busy week-
end. And I certainly hope that
LaPietra isn’t going to have an-
other student _ referendum before
his forum. He couldn’t possibly
be waiting for another unin-
_forrned vote to be taken. I just
Eknow he wouldn’t _do something

_j like that. Would you Jack‘?

ROTC; Study In How To Kill

Editor, The Pitt News:

 While many are bickering

about the academic accreditation
of ROTC on this campus. I would
like to view ROTC for a moment
from the perspective of the ulti-
mate end of ROTC. That is the
training of future or potentially
future officers f o r the armed
services of the United States.

Now, whether one is a hawk or
.a dove, if one possesses any hu-
man sanity, one should abhor war
—i.e., organized killing. '1 can un-

‘ derstand those who would study

the history of man as a history of
a succesion of organized kill-
ings. But to suggest that an aca-
demic community take up the

study of how to kill — to prepare
‘the skills of killing in students-
is a prostitution of the goals of
academia of the most sordid mag-
nitude. Are we a university or a
branch of the Pentagon?

That element on this“’”campus,

training in the manner that war
departments train. should not ex-
ist on a parallel basis with the rest
of this academic community.

Let them train killers as a func-
tion of war preparation — not as
an academic pursuit.

Abolish ROTC accreditation!

‘Democracy’

Editor, The Pitt News:

Richard Nixon was elected to
the highest and most crucial of-
fice in the United States. As I
think back through this year I
can’t help but feel frustrated with
the political system in our coun-
try. _

It was a year of candidates run-
ning and then not running and
then running again.

It was a year when Robert Ken-
nedy decided that he couldn’t let
Lyndon Johnson or Hubert Hum-
phrey run on his parties ticket.
He knew he would split the par-
ty but wasn’t it worth it to lead
the United States out of an un-
wanted war and away from in-
ternal problems at home? His
death wasn’t worth it.

This year should have showed
the American people that they
have very little say in what is go-
ing on. Eugene McCarthy led a
fantastic campaign and he told
it like it was. He was elected in
Pennsylvania’s primary by a sub-
stantial majority. And yet Penn-
sylvania’s delegation voted for
Humphrey at the convention. It
was like this in almost all the
states.

Is this how the people are rep-
resented?

Nixon wo n by an extremely
small margin. considering over 60
million people voted. In light of
this it is easy to imagine that the
vote could have gone to the elec-
toral college. Once again the peo-
ple would not have had a say. Is
this a democratic system, where
the President can be elected by a
few men who are supposed to rep-
resent 211 million Americans?

, Most.students._ reading this let-
ter will be voting soon. The frus-
trations and anger which they
must feel after this political year
should force them to give a damn

Sports ‘Loss Weekend’

by BILL NAAB _

In the Saturday morning 38 degree temperature, the Penn

State cross country team downed coach Jim Banner’s harriers,
20-41, handing them their first dual meet loss.

Banner stated. “They were just as tough as I thought they would
be. I was afraid of their four seniors. We have a good-team. and we

just met a better one.”

Jerry Richey’s 21:09 placed well
ahead of the Penn State harriers.
Richey mentioned. “It was a fast
first tw 0 miles.” He a d d e d.

“Those guys were much tougher
than what I had thought.”

State’s Ray Smith, 21:25, and
Mike Schurko, 21:34, finished sec-
ond and third, respectively. Steve
Gentry, Al Sheaffer, and Phil Pe-
terson captured fifth, sixth, and
seventh place for the Lions.

Junior runner Paul Zink’s 22:03,
the squad’s second best time, took
seventh. Greg Rodgers trailed in
eighth, while Ken Lawton and
Mark Vornhagen finished 12th
and 13th, respectively. Harriers
John Crozier, Mike Nolan, and
Bill Matajasic followed in the
16th, 17th, and 18th positions.

Banner’s squad apparently felt
dejected and amazed by the
strength of th e Penn State dis —
tancemen. Paul Zink stressted, “I
ran as hard as ever. Penn State’s
amazing. They moved ahead, and
I couldn’t go with them. I could-
n’t believe it. That’s the best time
I ran in my life. They caught me
going ‘uphill. They just run well
in a pack and we run scattered.”

At the midway point Zink ran
a strong third, while Jerry Rich-
ey held the lead, and Greg Rod-
gers was running fourth. Both Rod-
gers and Zink attributed the late
Penn State surge to their ability

’* to run well in a group. Lion coach

 Ray Groves stated, “Our object is

’‘ to get five guys to run together.

This can be a strong factor in a
big meet.” -

Groves also indic_a_ted_ that hi_s
team usually gets off to a slow
start. He added that the running
of Steve Gentry and Mike Schur-
ko pleased him a great deal.
“Gentry did real well since he
had a bad stomach cramp. and

 

 

 
  

EARLY IN THE race harriers Paul Zink (front, center), Greg Rodgers
(front, right) and Mark Vornhagen (front, left) held position on their
Penn State opponents. All, however, dropped back significantly as

Penn State came on to win, 20-41.

Schurko had been hurt. He’s a
month behind in conditioning,
and he’s going to do a lot better,”
said Groves. 0

Banner mentioned th at his
squad might feel disappointed but
everyone ran their best times ex-
cept for Richey. He singled out
Mark Vornhagen in particular.
“Mark did a tremendous job. This
was the first time that he’s run
since the first meet,” Banner re-
marked.

Banner indicated that the fresh

‘ had a bad day. Lion Greg Fred-

ericks won the race with a 22:12.5
time. The first of Banner’s har-
riers to finish the race was Bob
Hagner in 24:21. Dave Cobb ran
right behind Hagner in ninth
place, while Ken Balkey, Doug
Poust, and Fred Rossman finished
.13th, 14th, and 15th, respective-

ly. Penn State won decisively,
15-50.

Some men think the only
way to get a good, close shave
is with a blade.

If that's what you think,
we’d like to tell you something
abouttheNorelcoTripleheader
Speedshaver@. .

In a very independen
laboratory, we had some very
independent men shave one

   
 
 

©1968 North American Philips Company, Inc., 100 East 42nd Street, New York, N.Y._10017

ing stainless steel blade, and
the other side with a new
Norelco Tripleheader.

The results showed the
Tripleheader shaved as close
or closer than the blade in 2
out of 3 shaves. '

The Tripleheader has
three rotary blades inside new,
thin, Microgroovem heads that
‘float,’ so it follows your face,
to shave you closer.

\

The Tripleheader has a
pop—up sideburn trimmer. A
handy, coiled cord. And a 110/
220 voltage selector.

It comes in both a Cord
and a Rechargeable model. -I

And it won't pull or nick
or cut.

, Becauseit shaves your
beard.

Not your face.

you can't get any closer

Boot Victory
Tomorrow

The freshman soccer team re-
turns to action tomorrow after a
two week layoff. The booters will
attempt to win their second game
in four starts against the Com-
munity College of Allegheny
County at 3 p.m. at Kennard
Field.

Since the last game, the frosh
have scrimmaged the varsity sev-
eral times in hopes of improving
their overall play. In the first
three contests, the squad has con-
sistently outplayed the opposi-
tion, but has encountered consi-
derable difficulty in their scor-
ing attempts. The defense has al-

lowed only six goals in these‘

games.

he gets," said George “Mousta-
chio” Lies. “the better. He
smells.” According to latest ru-
mors. the bloated wonder hasn't
showered in eight weeks.

“I’m not proud.” admitted
“Bubba" needlessly. “Besides.
I’m afraid that if I was. I won‘t
win again. It’s been good luck
not to shower.” -

“It might be good luck for

_‘Bubba,”’ said Paul “Benito”

Stoller, “but it’s not for us. Every
time he comes up to the Pitt News
office, I have to keep spraying
air-freshner all over.”

“Benito” wouldn’t mind that
much, but the air-freshener is ex— >
pensive. Especially when yo u
consider just how much has to be
sprayed to clear the air of the
bloated wonder.

“I use up about six cans every
deadline night,” explained the
dictator. “and one can every day
after.”

But beleive it or not, “Bubba”
insists that he doesn’t smell that
bad.

“You guys are just jealous of
my lead,” said the bloated won-
der. “If I wasn’t winning. you’d
leave me alone.”
