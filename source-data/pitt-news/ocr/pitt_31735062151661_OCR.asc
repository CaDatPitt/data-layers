Tomorrow

Newly-Formed Group Ends
First Successful Term
After Tech Game

 

Tomorrow afternoon at 1 :30 o'clock,
the newly-organized cheering block
will perform for the last time this
year. '

Originated in the executive commit-
tee of SFA last year and through the
work of Louis C. Bearer, E37,_ SFA
chairman of the block, and Theodore
W. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men, the block has attained much
importance on campus.

Introduced at the Duquesne game,
the block was hailed as a deﬁnite
jinx. But subsequent games have dis-
proved that misconception. The cheer

_, leaders, advised by "William -Brinker,

assistant professor of chemical engi-
neering, have directed the block
stunts.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, commented: “This is something
new in the East, and Pitt students
‘have done a wonderful job. Most
schools use cards in their formations,
which don't allow for a permanent
picture. In our block, the members
wear jackets allowing for a quick
about-face and a stationary formation
This is an absolutely novel idea, and
should warrant the support of every
student.”

Designs for the block have been
created through the effort of John M.
Nutt, CE37, who has spent many
hours working out the patterns with
the help of Irwin W. Short, instructor
in civil engineering, who has acted in
an advisory capacity.

Bearer said, ».“I am happy in the
realization that we have done a good
job thus far. It is up to the indi-
vidual members of the block to co-
operate tomorrow to make our dem-
onstration the best of the year. I
know we can do it.” 3

Deﬁnite formations for tomorrow's
game will include: A -Scotch Terrier,
a Panther with a wagging tail, a
-big “C," a turkey, and the standard
HP."

Holiday Meeting Between Traditional.Riv-als To Close
Local Football Season As Panthers Seek Revenge;
Tartans After First Win In Eight Years

There is going to be no smell of roses, no touch of city title
but Pitt and Tech will be out there at 2 o'clock in the Stadium
tomorrow afternoon putting on their annual Turkey Trot. And
even without the ﬂowers‘ or the title the grid game is looming

up as a typical Panther-Tartan
worth something.

When these two teams have a get-
together it usually ends into a pretty
fair afternoon. Look at last year.
Tech came up to the end of the sea-
son with a somewhat sad record and
the Panthers were favored to" whip
the kilties .off’n the Tartans. But then
Tech tied the Panthers, 0-0, just as
an extra dressing to a heavily dressed
T~hanksgivi.ng. ‘ -

This year’s Turkey Trot resemble
that of last year in several ways. Last
season the Sutherlanders had won all
but one, with a scoreless tie with
Fordham thrown in, and the Harp-
sters had a poor season. As the 1936
season winds up, these records ex-
ist: Pitt, ;won six, .lost one, tied one;
Tech, won two, lost four. All of
which just paves the way for another
upset of some kind or another.

Panthers Move Up

And from the way this dizzy foot-
ball season has been revolving some-
thing just like that might happen.
Tech may wallop Pitt and again Pitt
may wallop Tech. And to make mat-
ters stretch a bit further, Pitt, if the
latter happens to happen, may even
get a Rose Bowl bid. It's all just a

Presbyterian Minister,
Union Executive Speak

 

Dr. Hudnut, William E. Hill
Discuss Soviet Russia
At Two Meetings

By John Martinco

Two impressions of Soviet Russia, ‘

one that of a Presbyterian minister,
the other that of a Negro trade union
leader, were presented before student
groups on the campus Monday.

The theological viewpoint was given
by Dr. Herbert B. Hudnut, pastor of
the Bellevue Presbyterian Church,
speaking at Inquiry Forum. William
E. Hill, executive secretary of the
Urban Industrial League, discussed
labor’s reactions to the Russian pro-
gram before a meeting of Inter-Cul-
tural Associates.

Dr. Hudnut reported both the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of the
Russian system, as he saw them. He
ﬁrst reviewed three important facts
which struck the observer in Russia,
which, he said, we would condemn as
Americans.

First among these, he named the
denial of civil and political liberty.
“Liberty in Russia, as in other dic-
tator-controlled countries,” he de-
clared, “means the liberty to applaud
the fine things a dictator does. Lib-
erty and freedom as we know it ‘in
this country do not exist in these dic-
tator nations."

Emphasize Militarism

The second condemnable point which
he listed was the tremendous empha-
sis on militarism. “The whole world
over there seems to be thinking about
one thing, and that is war.”

Thirdly, is the “horribly dogmatic
attitude towards everything," accord-
ing to Dr. Hudnut. He summarized
the Russian attitude towards religion
as being: “We are for science. Sci-
ence is against religion. Therefore
we are against religion."

Mr. Hill, addressing ICA, cited
some advantages of the Soviet system
gleaned from a trip he took through
the U.S.S.R. recently. Some of these
were that all property and land be-
longs to the state, that no worker
pays for rent in excess of 10 per cent
of the family income, and that there
is no unemployment in Russia.

Exploiters Gone

“Russia," he said, “has practically
solved the whole problem of national
minorities by removing the exploiters.
of the minority groups. Replying to
the customary retort that travelers in
Russia see only things that the gov-
ernment wants them to see, he said,
“It is virtually impossible to travel
5,000 miles, as I did, without seeing
bad features as well as the good
ones.”

Russia does not have all the com-
forts of America, he stated, but there
are many things to offset this. One
of these is the remarkable advance
in culture, he declared. Others he
listed as maternity care to mothers,
and a complete system of social se-
curity.

“The people have faith in their
own system and believe that they are
going places,” he said. “There is
certainly not a millenium in the coun-
try, and there are many faults, but
we must pay tribute to the courage
and perseverance of the people.”

 

Juniors To Ban Usual
Receiving Line From:
Tea Next Wednesday

Juniors will abandon tradition at

their annual Mothers’ Tea next‘

Wednesday when they have no receiv-
ing line at Heinz House to greet
guests. The affair will last from 3
to 5 o'clock.

Instead, acting as hostesses and
mingling informally with the mothers
will be Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean
of women; Miss Helen P. Rush, as-
sistant dean of women; Miss Frances
McLaughlin, assistant dean of women;
Miss Helen C. Battrick, executive sec-
retary of the YWCA; and Dr. Adaliiie
Wagner, instructor in classics, who is
faculty advisor to the class.

Margaret Billingsley, C, is chair-
man of the event.

  

Crunh, Crunh!

Feathered F owl Nonplussed
As Dance Approaches

   

“But he doesn't gobble,” an at-
tractive young lady remarked.

“Of course I don’t,” retorted the
brown-gray and mutton-colored aris-
tocrat, stretching his feathers. “You
college students are all alike. You
only know what you read in the
papers. Crunh, crunh.”

In between P crun-hs, Herky the
Turkey glared at the metal door
plates on Room 107, 'Alumni Hall,
and peeked profanely at his image.
Unaccustomed to crowds, especially
college people, the bird seemed non-
plussed.

“All you can do is stand there and
talk and gawk at me. Why, just Mon-
day a young fellow walked out of
Inquiry Forum in that room." Herky
pecked at the door again. “The rap-
scallion, V snickering to
pointed at me and said ‘Heh. You
just wait for the hatchet man. You’ll
get yours.’ Guess he thought he was,
smart, just because he knew how to
talk in Inquiry.

“By the way, I'm from the Her-
kay Grocery,” the bird punned.

“Another thing I can't stand is the
idea that you're using me for an ad-
vertisement.” He motioned to the
large sign announcing the College
Association Formal. “You put an
itchy collar around my neck, tie me
up with a rope, and tell the public
to go dancing. And you say you're
going to give them the bird. Crunh,

crunh. And you mean me. It's a rot-~

ten shame. Crunh, crunh.”

affirmative against Bernard Trumper,
BA38, and Robert McKee, C37, on
the utilities question.

The week's ﬁnal appearance for the
debaters will be at Westminster Col-
lege in New Wilmington, Saturday
afternoon. Competing with represen-
tatives of 14 other colleges and uni-
versities in the tri-state district, a
University group will compete in the
annual Westminster College tourna-
merit.

Freshman Dance
To Hear Gentry

Next Friday Night

Freshman Dance committeemen are
all a lather. Their fan mail has
suddenly taken on a threatening note.

From the poison pen of Michael
Aloysious Flannigan, self-styled suc-
cessor to One-Eyed Connolly, famous
gate-crasher, comes the news that he
will crash the dance next Friday eve-

 

Benn ballroom.

Flannigan, to all reports, is not a
piker. he has crashed such famous
places as the drawing room where
King Edward proposed to Mrs. Simp-
son, the egg-rolling contest on the
White House lawn, and the unveiling
of Gandhi's statue. The only im-
portant event to which he has not
been the first arrival was the birth
of the Dionne quintuplets, where he
was sixth.

If Flannigan does crash, he will
hear the scintillating rhythms of
Tom Gentry and his Ambassadors.
He will receive a program which will
set a new style in dance programs.
And, incidentally, he will have the
honor of crashing the ﬁrst yearling
dance featuring a “name” band.

Gentry comes_to the dance with his
music following a series of successes
in Chicago, St. Paul, and Memphis.
The maestro is a former movie star.

Tickets for the dance are two dol-
lars per couple and may be obtained
from any member of the committee or
at the Dean of Men’s office, Room
801, Cathedral.

This is a story about Oscar and
Joseph. , Itis a story both funny and
sad. But let us tell you about it. It all
happened. on the Pullman coming
back from‘New ‘York and the Pitt-
Fordham game, the game where all
the scoring went for naught.

Well, it seems that Oscar and
Joseph were re‘stle'3s'or maybe they
were.’ fuel "a wolple as little devils,
for they retsode‘-up rand -down the -
aislee looking Jeri something ,to do. A
FiIllly.;"IL!¢'}__.‘lII_ “smack into a
bunch of Pitt ‘gentlemen who were
somewhat cad over the outcome of
the game. And Oscar, always a
quick thinker, .said "Hello" shy-
likeiaid tolléweii :*that* up with e.
“we're P,itt‘gl'ad|_sat,a,e- and we think -
that Pitt  *,have'' won and
¢°|d|>¢'r_s -all-7'04 i Iwcet game."

That broke allnsignspof ice, thatis,
if the Pitt, gentlemen were drinking
theirs without. icefand Oscar and Jo-
seph we're‘ joyfully accepted into the
group. Oscar, the spokeman of the
combination of Oscar and Joseph,
went a little deeper into their life
histories and confessed that they

were graduated in‘ the" ‘class of '04 “

a’_nd wer‘e“Bis ’Adders. Butthat didn't
make any-’dif'fere‘nce and they were
still “good” fellows."
It’ only 'to'oi_' Oecar -and _ -Joseph" a
short  =-to-~-and .1 elm: the — train
was-«going ,-slow "and time . waa-‘ drag-.
ging and awastisi’. So Oscar shyly
suggested. a friendly...game.of dice,

But.‘ luck, just " like underwear,
changes quickly, and when the train

Panthers, Tartans Do
Some ‘Turkey Trot’

(Continued from Page 1)
re-hash of “Anything can happen.”

For, while the Panthers were idle
last Saturday, the results of major
football games merely boosted Pitt
football stock again. Notre Dame's
surprise trouncing of un-defeated
Northwestern, Georgia's Bulldogs tak-
ing a bite out of a California-bound
Fordham Ram, and Duquesne’s stop-
ping of the Marquette avalanc-he, all
went to help push the Panthers higher
in the nation's rating.

So that although two Southern
teams, Louisiana State and Alabama,
take favored Rose Bowl positions, the
Pitt team has moved up to a No. 2
rating in the country. Minnesota’s
Galloping Gophers have again taken
over the lead which they lost to
Northwestern for several weeks.

Returning to the theme, however,
the Tech-Pitt game tomorrow will at-
tract something like 30,000 to 40,000
fans, people who don't mind cold tur-
key. Both teams have- had 11 days
of rest since their last game and are
in the best condition of the season.

Howdy, “Howdy"!

Over on the Tartan side of Oak-
land, Coach Howard Harpster has
been playing his usual lineup in prep-
aration for the Panthers. And if it's
the same Harpster that led the Tech
team to their last victory over the
Panthers, eight long years ago, there
will be surprises and tricks aplenty in
the Tartan play. In Lehman to R0-
senthal, Howdy has one of the best
passing combinations in the East. Lee,
sophomore fullback, and Kopscak, vet-
eran quarterback, round» out Tech’s
probable starting backﬁeld.

In front of these four men isone
of the three best lines in Pittsburgh
circles. It’s " built around Captain
Nester Henrion, a crack guard and
paired with him is'Chyczewski. At the
ends are Miklausic and Patt, ends
who put an end to end runs, and the
tackles, two big boys, are Hudson and
Yeknich. The center of the line is a
fellow named Miskevics,-who is plenty
good defensively.

And now, trotting back to the Pan-
ther side of Oakland, Sutherland will
in all probability start the same

lineup _that husked and husked a

Huskerteam out in Nebraska 11 days
ago. That means Bill Daddio-and
Fab Hoffman at ends, Tony ,Matis-i
an-d Ave, Daniell at tackles, Biff
Glassford and Walt Raskowski, at

guards, and: big" ol’ Don Hensley at

center. In the backﬁeld is Johnny
Michelosen at quarter, Biggie Gold-
berg and Bobby LaRue at halves, and
Frank Patrick at fullback.

Eight Panthers Graduate

Tomorrow's game is the 28th in
the traditional rivalry betwixt the
Techers and the Pitters. The latter
has taken 21, been taken ﬁve, and
played give and take once, that being
last year when the scoreless tie was
played. Also in tomorrow's game will
b-ethe parting of the ways of eight
Panther footballers and the 1937
team. Only three of these, Biff Glass-
ford, LaRue and Daniell, can be classed
as first string regulars this season.

Of the others, two ﬁne halfbacks,
Johnny Wood and Leo Malarkey,
and Arnold Greene, quarterback, were
on the second team and when given
the chance did some mighty ﬁne play-
ing for the Panthers. Rounding out
the graduation-ers are Bobby Mc-
Clure, quarterback, John Dougert,
fullback, and Clean Linderman,
guard, each one of the-m doing a good
job when called upon.

5 l:Fo~r Coming Season

Coach ‘Schricker’ Releases (Schedule ‘For Leather Slingers;
S'tatc.,.Bucknell, Tech, Temple, West Virginia Carded

After three weeks of sparring with their shadows and trying to out-
smart a punching*bag,- Coach‘Jack Schricker's varsity and freshman leather-
slingers will “raise the beat” in their drills today following the release of
the 1936-37 ﬁght schedule. According to the new list of engagements, the
‘Panther will loseitschance to re-vengiihe defeats suffered at the hands of

Syracuse and Wisconsin last year, as‘
both these teams have been dropped, -

but Penn State's.powerful ringmen
will show here for the ﬁrst time in
Pitt's boxing history, bringing the
number of meets‘ carded up to seven,
one less than last" year.“

Catholic ‘University -will provide
the -ring as-"well as the boxers for
the local punchers in_ the season's
opener for both aggregations on Feb-
ruary 6. The" Schricker‘ men will
then hurry‘ back to home “canvas”
for the ﬁrst of their two scheduled
local appearances, this one with Penn
State on Tuesday, February 9, and
then will conclude a busy six days
when they shuffle over to Wash-Jeff
to swap punches with the Presidents,
Friday, February 12.

Following a week's rest, the Blue
and Gold ringsters. visit Tech and
Temple, whom they defeated last
winter. Bucknell will be the attrac-
tion at the Panther’s second and last
stadium showing.  West Virginia,
held to=a surprise-t,-I tie ayes: ago,
waiting to knock Hie hide ‘off the
Panther at Morgantown in the sea-
son’s ﬁnale on‘ Much :13. ‘

L.._-.

Coach Schricker’s hopes for a bet-
ter-than-average season have suffered
considerably because several ﬁghters
whom he was counting on to be key
men in the present squad have failed
to report for training. Al Paslowski,
125-pound captain of the ’35-'36 team,
has decided not to box. George Dines,
‘regular 155-pounder, is ﬁnding medi-
cal studies a little too steep to make
use of his last year of ineligibility,
and heavyweight Ted Schmidt is still
undecided but probably won't be back
for his second season. The only let-
termen deﬁnitely returning for an-
other taste of leather a la intercol-
legiate are Abe Konick, 135 pounds;
George Kennedy and Herb Cummings,
145 pounds; Art Leonard, 165 pounds,
and Captain Cleon Linderman, 175-
pounder.

New men showing class in the bag-
punching and rope-skipping drills are
Bob Gray, Ray Bombi, Ralph Dorand,
Mike Ianuzzi and Al Lupinacci, all up
from the frosh squad. Among this
year's freshman aspirants Johnny
Wargo and Jedro Curzi have im-
pressed Schricker and his first assist-
ant, Willie Davies. . _.

when he gets ready for the kick-

Pitt Natators
Meet Canton
Y Next Week

There will be more than the usual
amount of splashing in the Trees
Gym pool when the c—ombined‘Pitt
varsity and freshman tank teams dive
into the water in an effort to out-
splash the Canton (Ohio) Y natators
in a practice meet December 2. one
week from tonight.

Nothing d-epends upon. the out-
come of the meet, since it was sched-
uled merely to give the regulars their
ﬁrst taste of competition this seas-on
and to see how the freshmen and
untried varsity candidates will stand
up under pressure. Sure bets to be
in the diving are Red McQ_uil-lan and
Bill Brown, the varsity expert board-
men. The freshman team will have
no representative in the diving event
as candidates for that event on the
freshman squad. are as scarce as
scores in a Pitt-Fordham game. Russ
Lindberg, the assistant tutor of the
tankers, said that even a mediocre

 

diver would be made welcome and 

sure of a position on the team.

Tom Lock-e is a certainty in the
440-yard free-style, while Nowotny
and Bob Keck are certainties in the
100, with" Bill Dill and Bob Schra-
der as company from the freshman
outﬁt.

In the 150-yard backstroke Bernie
Delake from the varsity and Al Slo-
bodian and Al Beacon, yearlings, will
be featured. Tom Anderson and the
two Ledersteines, the latter two

from the frosh mermen, will take ‘

the part of the Panthers
breaststroke.

Lelake, a sophomore who made a
place for himself on the ﬁrst year
squad in 1936, is turning into a good
breaststroker, although his specialty
is the backstroke, which he swam ex-
clusively last year. He will not be
able to swim both of these events
in one meet. 0

Showing ' the most improvement
over last year's performance is Bob
Keck, a senior this year. Bob is a
short distance free-style artist. Jim-
my Lavine is. still disappointing in
the time it is taking him to getinto
proper form, but he will probably
be much improved by the time the
ﬁrst scheduled meet comes around.
Tom Locke and Walt Nowotny are
doing well, and will be ready along
with the others for the ﬁrst meet. .

Defeat Phi
Delts, 13- 7

Stage Set For Final Game
With Fijis Next Monday
Trees Gym Field

 

Kappa Sig’s touch football
congregation marched right on
down into the finals by demol-
ishing a Phi Delt ambition to
upset the laurel bearers in a
good rip-roaring thriller on
Trees Gym ﬁeld Monday after-
noon that ended 13-7 in favor
of the defending champs.

Scoring on a pass from Charley
Groat to Morrissey in the middle of
the opening quarter and piling up
the extra point on another pass in
which the same two players ﬁgured,
the Kappa Sigs rolled up an early
lead. A last minute aerial that was
still en route from Cashdollar to
Chuck Wright when the whistle end-
ing the quarter blew put the Phi
Delts back in the running. When
Wright snared Schoo1ey’s pass into
the end zone" to even up the game,
the Phi Delts returned on an even
basis.

Getting Their Groat!

Action was stymied until the last
quarter when Groat executed a shoe-
string catch of a pass unleashed by
Cashdollar to give Kappa Sigs pos-
session of the ball in midﬁeld. The
tables were reversed when Cashdollar
pulled down a pass of Groat’s intend-
ed for Morse.

An exchange of kicks in the ﬁnal
quarter brought the necessary break
of the game for the Kappa Sigs.
Schooley, Phi Delt standout on the
defensive, received Groat’s kick close
to the corner by the side lines; he
turne-d and hurled a lateral across the
field in the general direction of
‘G1-osscope, who let the ball elude him
and roll out deep in the Phi Delt
coﬁin corner.

Cashdollar, who had been kicking
the Phi Delts out of danger a.ll after-
noon, booted from behind his own
goal line, but McCutcheon, Kappa

Sig center, crashed through the line’

to block the kick and send the ball
toppling into the end zone, where
Jimmy Shields, Kappa Sig end, fell
on it to put the defending champs
out front again, 13-7.

The Interfratern-ity touch foo-tball
tourney reaches its climax next Mon-
day when Kappa Sigs battle the Phi
Gams in the ﬁnal-s.

Student Opinion

HE exact function of a student newspaper

often cannot be accurately deﬁned by the
students who attempt to express student opinion
through the editorial columns.

It is therefore even more remote to believe
that the large bulk of students should appreci-
ate the signiﬁcance of a student newspaper.

With this in mind there appears elsewhere on
this page, which should represent and express
student opinion, an invitation for contributions.
This, we believe, is a good thing.

A student newspaper has ﬁrst of all the func-
tion that is the fate of all newspapers. The news
must be printed. It should be presented as
straightforwardly and accurately as possible.
The style should for the most part be simple and
almost primitively understandable to allow com-
munication to varying types and classes of people.

However, at a University, where it is ac-
knowledged the reputed “better minds” gather

for daily conferences, the thing should go a bit
further.

Student opinion should be an important part
of a student newspaper. News is news. But
opinion is something different. It must be
creative expression as concluded following a
close inspection of the salient facts. When a
student paper expresses such things then it may
achieve its chief purpose.

The Grindstone

Early tomorrow morning thousands of farmers
throughout the country will be happily “grinding their
axes’ in anticipation of the killing of some thousands
of fat turkeys for Thanksgiving feastboards. Some time
next week these same farmers will be turning over the
same grindstones, but perhaps with a different mien.

From time to time all of us have grindstones to turn.
Sometimes we turn them with alacrity, other times with
bold determination, or with forlorn hopelessness. Be-
fore this column turns over for the last time it is our
fond hope that many student axes will have been “put”
to the wheel. It is our desire to set up the grindstone,
supply the power necessary to turn it, and depend upon
students of varying shades of opinion to bring their axes
to have them sharpened and made ready for the uses to
which they should best be put.

Of the several thousands of undergraduates there
is not one who at some time has not had “an ax to
griiid,” and who would not have welcomed the oppor-
tunity to have his opinion listened to and concurred in.
or criticized by, his fellow students.

There is none among us who has not at one time or
other longed for the opportunity to set forth opinions
on The News, SFA, Men's Council, school dances, the
American Student Union, the Band, Pitt Players, or the
various groups or institutions connected with our col-
lege life.

There are two types of persons who like to “blow off
steam”: Those who feel that the whole undergraduate
student body is going to ruin unless they “get in their
licks.” These will criticize destructively for no good rea-
son at all. Then there are those who will speak, not for
the sake of hearing themselves talk, but because they
sincerely believe that their statements are of some
importance, and that their suggestions may be of some
use to the University. We should mention still another
group——a deﬁnite group of persons who take no interest
in campus life, or campus improvement. This is the
group that refuses to express opinions in public, and
then raises a wail when something takes place which
they have opposed right along.

We will try to satisfy all three groups by allowing
them to grind their axes at the grindstone. Certainly“,
some students have opinions on the Spanish situation, on
American foreign policy, on football teams, and a
million and one other subjects.

Surely, you will say, why not let the authorities man-
age these things? Yes, we say, leave it to authorities, but
there is as yet no one person who has cornered a mon-
opoly on ideas, on methods. Also, there may be some
undergraduates who might lighten the burden of these
authorities.

From the “outside” there may be some who see things
in a different light, from a different angle, than do the
so-called student or non-student authorities. It is to
these people, who are desirous of “sharpening their
axe_s,”_ that we issue the blanket invitation to contribute
their ideas, and Judgments for the beneﬁt of all of us.

A student newspaper should try to lighten the burdens
of the students for whom it is published. A student legis-
lative association is established to further the welfare of
the students for whom it is created. Without cooperation
neither group is able to _do its best job. The student on
the outside has worthwhile opinions, and these opinions
are to be sharpened and made effective at the grindstone.

The grindstone 1S created!. The motivating power is
supplied! Now let us_see how long the line-up will be of
those wishing to “grind their axes”.

Statements addressed to “The Grindstone,” care of
The Pitt News, Room 709, Cathedral, will be published

Ti}? Talked To Himself

. By Milton Lehman
FREE VERSE ANo"ri-iE YOUTH
Red hot radishes
With a touch of bitter

Biting pepper
Is (I say it sotto voce)
Like you, who

   

Are
Red Hot.
A dream fantasy? A rebellious touch of the coni-
monplace? A gripping, fervid plea to the ages? Not
at all.

More as a premise than a promise, an unsympathetic
typewriter and I dashed this off. It has little sense, is a
stupid smear of words, and, even if it could be sincere,
is just vague enough to be pointless. It represents, if
nothing else, a typical poem of “inspired” youth.

And, believe me, you too could dash oif reams of
similar tripe without even trying. But if you crushed
this up in a ball and shot it into the nearest waste-
basket, we could forgive you. The trouble is that you
would probably type it out neatly, slap on a title such
as “Rebellion” or “Youth” or “Sadist,” and promptly
send it to Scribners. And of course the printed rejection

slip would annoy you.
*

* * *

I can never imagine that Walt Whitman wanted
to encourage youth to pound out nonsense and call it
free verse. True, he attempted to liberate poetry
from over-rigid stylistic devices. True, he desired
to take the minds of poetasters away from Cupid
and Venus and the “glory that was Greece and the
grandeur that was Rome.” True, he, ﬁrst of them
all argued that the Glory of the Commonplace was a
large enough ﬁeld for modern writing.

all all as as

But Mr. Whitman, even by stretching our imagination
as well as his principles, never advocated RED HOT
PEPPERS (and sotto voce, at that). Youth simply
misinterpreted.

“Then aren’t there any little snatches of free verse,
sharp and brilliant in their suggestiveness, that are
poetry?” you ask. “What about A-my Lowell? And
have you seen Vachel Lindsay's “Congo”?

Yes, this free verse was, for the most part, poetry.
The Congo” with its fervid “boomlay, boomlay, boom-
lay, boom” is free verse, and it is stirring and dramatic.
and it creates an intense emotional impression. The
crux of the matter is that Miss Lowell and Mr. Lindsay
had something to say, they knew how they wanted to
say it, and they said it vigorously.

* II! III 5|‘

Is there any test for modern poetry?. How are we
to recognize it? Probably the only test for a poem is
the sincerity of the writer. Nervous dilettante who
write out a few stanzas between bridge parties are to
be excluded.

I have never seen a deﬁnition of the word “poetry”
that could not be criticized and disputed. Edgar
Arlington Robinson said: “Poetry has two outstand-
ing characteristics: one is that it is, after all, unde-
finable. The second is that it is unmistakable." That
pretty nearly strikes home.

Go ahead and write your emotions in iambs and
dactyls, and put four or ten to the line, if you like.
Then read it aloud, tearing it apart line by line. Write
it again. Work on it as long as your inspiration lasts,
and then read it aloud.

Ask yourself these que-stioiis: Do I have something
to say? Have I said it? Will anyone else understand
what I mean, and do I know what I mean myself?

* * * *

Am I able to defend this piece of work, and can I
fight for every word and every line I have written?
Can I justify what I have said?

If you cannot, tear it up. Don’t tell yourself that
you have a neat phrase here in “strawberries drop-
ping hard against the mud,” and a unique ﬁgure there
in “the sun looked like a red tennis ball being Iobbed
over the net.” That isn’t poetry, and you are not
justified.

And Robinson did say, “poetry is unmistakable.”

 

News Reviewer Declares
Show [Disappointing

By Raymond Maclntyre

Before two fairly large audiences at the Frick Train-
ing School auditorium Monday and yesterday evenings,
Pitt Players presented their second major production of
the season, “'l"he First Mrs. Fraser” by St. John Ervine.
With the exception of the performances of perhaps two
members of the cast, the show was, to put it charitably,
disappointing.

It was Shirley Rugh and Michael Kozey who, in this
reviewer’s opinion, supplied what aesthetic pleasure
there was to be had from good acting. Miss Rugli played
Janet, the first wife of James Fraser, who, deserted by
his second, trotted home with the expectation of resum-
ing with his first. Janet, quite naturally, was unwilling
to be resumed so peremptorily, and handsome James,
cleterinined to win, was forced to begin the courting
process over again.

One thinks of Janet as a good-looking, well-bred
woman with considerable warmth of heart, inasmuch as
she held no bitterness toward her strayed husband, and
was willing to receive him as a friend in her home.
Miss Rugli acted the part, we thought, with feeling and
excellent judgment, adding no little to her performance
by her clear voice, with careful though unstilted diction.

Michael Kozey Performs Creditably

Michael Kozey, whose work is also deemed credit-
able, portrayed Philip Logan, a cultivated, dapper little
Englishman of middle years, a man-about-town, a wordly
fellow whose two main interests were ﬁshing and the
pleasure of Mrs. Fraser. Kozey showed an acute ap-
preciation of the humor of the situation and the dia-

logue, augmenting the general satisfactoriness of his.

work with a well-articulated English accent.

A colloquy between him and Mrs. Fraser in the sec-
ond act, where the two are discussing Logan’s having
seen. the second Mrs: Fraser at a country inn with
Mario, a night clubdancer, struck this reviewer as par-
ticularly good. A proposal scene, the same two ac-
complished smoothly in the third act. Both episodes
were a joy to behold—especially by comparison.

Another member of the cast who merits a word or
two of comment is Robert Madden, C37. Madden
played his part with some feeling, certainly. Further-
more, he was at ease on the stage, slouching on chairs
and the sofa as though he really were at home, although
his squirming did distract a bit. But the point against
Madden is that he failed, at least in our opinion, to
realize the character. He looked, acted, and talked
more like Grove City ’39 than Oxford.

_ Jean Delmore, as Mabel the Maid, proved quite sat-
isfactory. However, when she upset the teapot, nothing
ran out, and this seemed all wrong.

_Rex Lod_er as.Jaines Fraser left a great deal to be
desired. His voice was resonant and clear, but his
S0m€What m0I10t_0n0_us booming baritone was artiﬁcial.
on the Purely 1311??-Sical side he was irritatiiigly uncom-
fortable 9“ the Stage, ﬁdgeting and shifting in his chair
and looking for a place to put his hands.

‘The First Mrs. Fraser’ Is ‘Last’

Robert Gump as Murdo Fraser, the Older brother of
Nlnian. might as well have had his book along and read
the lines. As nearly as we can recollect, Mary Annette
Campbell, who played Alice, his wife, Was Slightly bet-
t9I'- And it may be said in all fairness that Babette
Braude, who played Elsie, the second Mrs. Fraser-—-a
hard, brazen young woman who was out for What she
Could get-‘”W0_“1d hardly have sent even Podunk Valley
theater goers _into ecstacies over the feeling and expres-
sion she put into her role.

The Play itself was nothingto stand on one’s head
about. It was pretty thin stuff. There was clever dis-
loérue 11} Sp0tS. and laughs were drawn, but we feel that
“The First Mrs. Fraser” is not oine

posterity will cherish_

of those plays which

ETCYAETIJRA

I might have known Grandma
would be right: she always is. Just
the other day I said, “Pitt Players are
having another first night. ‘First
Mrs. Fraser.’ All about a woman and
her ex-li. and his wife.” Grandma
looked up from her annual novel like
most people do from a dish of ice
cream. “So what?” she stumped me

A lot of nice people ﬁrst-nighted it.
Charles Byron Holstein, the “By
Ron” man of a past generation,
brought along a nice case of acute
alumnity; and Eugene Cohen, last
year’s Players’ president, came
around just for the fun of it. Was
he glimpsing or gloating?

The time—mellowed handshaker, Al
Berkowitz (Berky to everybody but
Chaney), shook hands. Berky, you’ll
remember, was the popular man-
about-campus who was never oflicially
recognized, even though he collected
handshakes like a philatelist collects
philatels.

Charles Foreman was there, too;
but then, being technical director of
the play, he did have a moral obliga-
tion. Irene Matveak, playing Mentor,
swept in with a trail of corsaged
freshmen. Our new Date Bureau
must have been fresh out.

I felt a litle disappointed when
George Seibel didn’t show up for the
second act, but was quite pleased to
ﬁnd that Thomas Wolfe didn’t show
up, either.

Before the ﬁrst curtain and be-
tween acts, the orcliestra established
a nice, playhouse atmosphere with its
light pieces. The girl who always
wears her hat while ﬁddling her music
wore her hat.

About the play:
ushers did look nice.
