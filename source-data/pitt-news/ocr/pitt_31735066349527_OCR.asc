Student Observer Status

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) is
the only union so far to officially

respond in favor of a Student’,

Government Board (SGB) proposal
for. student input in the collective
bargaining process.

See‘ pg. 8 for union positions.

The SGB proposal, which receiv-
ed unanimous support from the
AAUP executive .and administra-
tive committees, calls for full
participation in bargaining pre-
caucuses and observer status at the
bargaining table for students.

The Pitt Professional Union
(PPU) and the Pennsylvania State
Education Association (PSEA) have
not made ofﬁcial statements on the
SGB proposal.

With the Moser proposal for student negotiators and the subsequent
Student Government Board resolution calling for only student
observers, the contending unions had yet another opportunity to mak
political hay out of the subject of student concerns. -

The executive and administrative committees of the American
Association of University Professors (AAUP) endorsed on Friday the
concept of student observers at the bargaining table. But even the
AAUP leadership admits this is no guarantee of student participation
until the collective bargaining councils approve it.

The Pitt Professional Union (PPU) offered a vaguely worded
proposal for student involvement, the extent of which would be decided
later by a specially appointed committee. It has yet to respond to the

.. question of student observers.
Q»? The Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA) has given no
statement of support for any student role at the bargaining table. For
this attitude, we have nothing but a strong sense of disgust and the
knowledge that the PSEA is unmoved by students’ precarious position

in negotiations between administration and faculty.

(Continued on Page 4)

  Gets AAUP Approval

“I think it’s unfortunate and
possibly detrimental that the PSEA
and the PPU could not and would
not reply to our proposal,” SGB
President Barry Weisband said.

PPU head Van Beck Hall said the
SGB should have a reply to its
proposal by this afternoon. PSEA
head Donald McBurney said the
PSEA probably would not reply
until after the union elections this
week.

AAUP President Seth Spaulding
said Friday’s AAUP’ executive

committee endorsement is not an '

ultimate guarantee that students
would have full participation in the
pre-bargaining table councils.

He said the executive committee
would strongly recommend accep-

Through Oakland

iBusLane

BY BOB comiii

The reverse-ﬂow bus lane on
Fifth Avenue may be extended
through the center of Oakland in a
move to aid_,the financially troubled
Port Authority Transit (PAT).

PAT and the City Council have
been working together on the
project. A

The reverse-flow lane, in which
buses travel _outbound against

inbound trafﬁc, now ends at Craft,

Avenue. The new plan calls for an
extension to Bellefield Avenue,
permitting greater ridership..

The project would eliminate 73
parking spaces in the Oakland
area.

According to Larry Chaban,
president of the Commuter Assoc-
iation, the only advantage will be
for older people who are going to
the Medical Center.

a Monday, March , 8, l976

Keep your eyes on these people: they’ll be the ones to know about the

tuition hike first if the state releases an austere budget soon. From
left, Student Government President Barry Weisband, Vice Chancellor
of Business and Finance Joe Dutton, Chancellor Wesley Posvar and

tersl” hessaid. “Most of_the

-spaces eliminated will be the

24-hour spaces.”

Chaban said the new plan
probably will affect night students
most because they often come‘in
for one class and park in two-hour
spaces.

The pl-an was initiated by
Councilman Richard Caliguiri and
was one of several considered. The
City may be able to save PAT
$240,000 per year under the plan.

Other suggestions for cutting
PAT costs included the City taking

Pitt Official Answe rs.  
Directory   Complaipntsl A 

BY STEVE SYBERT

Efforts at taking legal action
against the University by students
whose names appeared in, the
Student Telephone Directory with-
out their consent would prove
fruitless, claimed Alden Bowen,
coordinator of the University
Student Judicial System.

‘The controversy began when the
names, addresses and phone
numbers of several students
appeared in the directory after they
had signed waivers supposedly
excluding such a listing.

One General Studies student
contemplating legal action for
invasion of privacy. Other students
have cited. a violation’ of the
Buckley Amendment, which says
an educational institution may not
release information about a student
without his consent.

Bowen said, though, that print-
ing a student directory is permis-
sible‘ if the option to omit
information is announced to the
students. Inaction by students is
cznsidered tantamount to their
c nsent to having their names in
the directory. Three hundred
waivers reportedly were signed.

Bowen said the University in no
way can be blamed for the

   

University Senate President William Brown.

Extension Planned

potholes between ‘PAT’s ‘streetcar-

rails on city streets. ; ~ ~ “

‘At present, the City patches" PM 
potholes outside the tracks, and the

authority takes care ‘of the area

A Other suggestions includ_e“d__help-
ing the authority with sign-‘painting

a bus-only road.

In return, vCalig'uiri asked ._ the ‘

authority to come'up with ways to

“With everything I checked out, 0

no one was negligent in performing
their function in this whole chain of
events other than the students
themselves,” he said. “Every,
University employe involved at-‘
tempted to do what they were
supposed to do.”

An investigation by Bowen has

revealed several possible reasons ,

for the unwelcome inclusion in, the
directory.

According .to Bowen, students“
possibly gave the signed waivers to
the wrong office or did not
accurately give their full names and
Social Security numbers, leading to
improper keypunching or computer
mistakes from faultv information.

Sloppy writing-by the students
involved also may have led to
oversights by the people who
compiled the book, Bowen said. O

“The University apologizes to
the people affected,” Bowen said.
We changed what we're going to
do for next year, so even that can't
happen again."

The directory was compiled not
by the University but by Ultra
Media Systems, the publisher, and
the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity.

tance of the plan once the collective
bargaining councils are formed in
the Provost’s area and the Health
Professions area after the election.

“The collective bargaining coun-
cils. are semi-autonomous, and
since they have not been formed,
we cannot demand student partici-
pation,”__Spaulding said. “But
with unanimous support from the
AAUP chapter leadership, we can

 Iertainly inﬂuence the councils to
‘K iliicorporate student input in collec-

tive bargaining pre-caucuses.”

Weisband said if both parts of
the SGB proposal are accepted, it
would not mean immediate SGB
support for the unions.

Hall said he would encourage the
PPU executive council to use the
SGB proposal as a basis for student
participation in the collective
bargaining process.

“Right now, the proposal is a bit
vague,” he said. “We’ve received
communications from night stu-
dents and from the regional
campuses, and we don’t know how
to incorporate their input.”

The council would have to
examine the similarities between

forum on unionization, Hall said.
The PPU proposal said the PPU
would establish a special commit-
tee to discuss specific proposals for
student involvement. -It also said
the faculty contract committee
would entertain student proposals

of mutual interest to faculty and
students.

Hall said the PPU also would
examine implications of observer
status for students.

“We have to examine the
necessity of a secrecy requirement
and the administration’s reactions
toward student observers at the
bargaining table,” Hall said. _

Director of University Legal
Services William Hannan said in
the event of unionization, the
administration would "welcome
student input.

“We would welcome students as
observers as long as they are
official representatives and would
not interrupt normal negotiations,”
Hannan said. i

The PSEA has not had’ a chance
to react to the SGB proposal,
McBurney said. , ’

“We have previously stated we_
have objections to student obser-
vers,_although once you deal with
student participation there are
problems," McBurney said.

McBurney said student partici-
pation in pre-bargaining caucuses
could result in a loss of strategy for
the unions in their negotiations.

“We would want to meet with
students to talk about parti_cular
issues that effect students, but as
soon as you have a third party in on
your strategy session, you lose the
strategy,” McBurney said. _

He also said the nature of
collective bargaining is not condu-
cive to third-party participation.

The University Health Center of

The plan involves a consolidation

POSVAR SAYS TUITION HIKE

“If we have to do it, we would
want it to be a limited amount,”
Posvar said, adding he is very
reluctant to speak about tuition
until after the state appropriation
process is ﬁnished. \

He pointed out that tuition «at

in response to a question concern-
ing the effect another tuition hike
might have on students.

He said a recent drop in the
number of Pitt students coming
from blue-collar families might be

Posvar blamed the need for an
increase in ‘ state appropriations

Tomorrow's Election...

{ Continued from Page 1)

Faculty voting in the union elections unavoidably will reflect on what
this disenfranchisement of students by the union leadership means.

Did some faculty unions simply ignore student interests in the race

to get elected? If so, this reﬂects poorly on their ability to handle more
than one narrow interest at a time.

Did they ignore student interests because they judged students to be
powerless and therefore unworthy of notice? If so, reflect on what kind

' of power is deemed suﬂicient to garner support by a faculty union, and

more importantly, reﬂect on whether you have enough of it to make
"your individual needs felt at the bargaining table. _
, Did certain faculty unions‘ ignore student  out of %sheer
political fears of open-ended "three-party negotiations? If so, consider
what is so terrible that only the eyes of hardened union leaders and
‘attorneys may look upon it. .
 fdthey ignore student interests because they assumed “student
interests” are too amorphous and that studnets can’t really handle the
complex matters of collective bargaining? "If so, then think twice about
the vast variety of faculty interests in the Provost’s area, and think
‘twice’ about who makes the decision on which point of view is
" competent and which point of view "is unsophisticated, even
. ‘ ‘student-like. ’ ’

Did some faculty unions ignore student interests because they were
afraid an outright stand would jeopardize their political solvency? If so,
judge whether you will been the right side of the scale when your turn
comes.

' This is simply the first phase of faculty unionization at Pitt. By voting
against contenders who refuse to deal‘ with students, you will give
those union organizers a message: Nextvtime be honest, or at least
have enough consideration to lie skillfully. .

There must be a change in the power structure of this University, but
in light of the disenfranchisement of student interests by certain
faculty unions, there is a disturbing feeling that beneath it all lies the
same old power politics, as fresh as ever. «

...And Who Must  Win

Ifnothing else, certain faculty unions’ stand on student participation
is frustrating in light of how little it really would have taken to
recognize legitimate student interests.

I The Pitt Professional Union (PPU) and the Pennsylvania State
‘Education Association (PSEA) informed student leaders quite clearly
that student seats at the bargaining table would not be given in a
faculty union scenario at Pitt. _VVith these statements, they stripped
themselves of whatever trappings of collegiality, academic concern and
professional interest they might have summoned in the course of their
campaigns.

It is simply the case of these unions turning on students with the very
tools of ambiguity, rhetoric and empty promise they profess to dislike
in the Pitt administration.

It is a tragedy, because faculty unionization, as a tool, holds great
promise at a bargaining table at which students, faculty and
administraiton could discuss and ﬁnalize priorities at the institution.

The Mgser proposal the faculty unions cynically buried with
supposedly reviling “management tactics” of disenfranchisement and-
neglect asked simply for faculty and administration to come across with
an act of good faith. The faculty unions could not bring themselves to
sign a piece of paper that would recognize the existence of student
ooncems.

Instead of an act of good faith, students were handed empty, hollow

, ‘statements: “Even though a strike now might hurt students in the

To the state legislature:

A W’ay to Save the Schools

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

An open letter to any member of
the state legislature:

For the second year in a row
there is speculation on the
possibility of a tuit.'on hike, and for
the second year in a row we are
being told that the money is just
not.available to prevent it. Last

' year, thousands of us from across
the state wrote to you, appealing to

your humanitarian instincts, ex-'
plaining how a tuition hike would

hurt the underprivileged.

Your answered itis unfair for the
middle class to bear the burden of
sending these people to school.
This year, your arguments sound
much the same.

What is ironic is that most of us
agree with you that the middle
class is overburdened by taxes.
What puzzles us is this; while you
tell us that you are concerned about
the burden on the middle class and

the furthering of higher education,

you show us no action.
Instead you throw a question into

' ourxlapz “Where would we get the

money?” implying it.is our
responsibility to solve the ﬁscal
problems you were elected to
handle.

Well, rather than bother with
another futile mass letterwriting
campaign, a few of us‘ have some
suggestions to offer.

The simplest way to raise money
would be .to install a truly
graduated income tax. You are
right, there is no need to increase

taxes for the middle class if you
simply institute a one or two
percent surcharge on the upper
ﬁfth of all wage earners. The
Talmud teaches that one of the
purposes of obtaining wealth is to
distribute it tothose who need it.
Are there any worthier traditions to
uphold?

But if the political pressure is too
great against instituting tax re-
form, here is an alternative. Lower
the drinking age to 18. The
increased revenue brought into
state liquor stores could be/applied
directlyto higher education. This
is appropriate, since stores with the
greatest increase in business would
be ones near college campuses.
One advantage to this is it does not
cause any great reversal in
accepted morality. In fact,
Pennsylvania lags behind all of its
neighbors in_ reforming "its drinking
age. So Pennsylvania would only
be keeping in step with other
‘states.’

There are other, more radical
plans, which we feel merit
consideration; » They include the
legalization and taxation of certain
vices, namely gambling, prostitu-
tion and marijuana.

« - Consider marijuana ﬁrst. Its
legalization presents the least

V amount of problems since no new

agency would be required to
supervise its sale and regulation.

This could be handled by the liquor
control board. It is also apropos
because it would mainly affect the
college campuses, so there is again

Letter to the Editor

the possibility of funneling monetf;

made from college areas right bac
into higher education. .

Legalization of prostitution
would help healthwise, as well as
raise additional money for the
state. But it would also cause a
great outcry from Pennsylvania
preachers.

Legalized gambling, on the other
hand, would probably cause the
least outcry. We already have a
form of it in the Pennsylvania
lottery and horseracing’. .Why not
allow the establishment of casino/
hotels like those in Las Vegas, with

the state claiming part of 
revenue. Not only would the state "

profit from the gambling money,
but also from the revenues
generated by the many tourists
who would be attracted from out of ~
state.. .

We realize that some of these
proposals go against certain
systems of morality. But a choice
must be made; either you enact
some of these reforms or the
middle class must go on paying
higher -taxes in order to save its
outdated morality.“--»

In any case, funding to" higher
education must increase. To fail to
do this will bring about the

eventual demise of many of thoi-“'ﬁ_$;.

institutions which ‘you now cherislf.‘ '
If you sense a veiled threat, you are
correct in doing so. The current
calm is only the eye of the storm.

A Suggestion of Collusion

I take forceful exception to
Provost Rhoten Smith’s intrusion
into the orderly pre~election activi-
ties of the faculty. ' In a letter dated
Feb. 23 addressed to his collea-
gues, Smith came out against
unionization at Pitt. His argument
was almost fact for fact, reference
for reference, the same argument
given in both printed handouts and
the Friday Senate meeting, by the
Teachers for an Independent
Faculty (TIF). This similarity of
argument suggests collusion be-
tween the provost and the TIF. I
find it delightfully ironic that those
who wish independence can coop-
erate so well amongthemselves.
Ipersonally resent Provost Smith
addressing us as his colleagues. He
is not my colleague. Neither he nor
Chancellor Wesley Posvar nor

Dean Jerome Rosenberg is my
colleague—they are all my bosses.
They do not teach courses atthis
University; they are not engaged in
the same activities I am. engaged
in: they are concerned with the
balancing of their budget and the
maintenance of their own power.
What collegiality / they have,
consists of encouraging _faculty to
take part in the Charade of

. governance and ignoring whatever

faculty really wants. That they are
not my colleagues" was definitely

decided by the Pennsylvania Labor

Relations Board, which ruled that

they could not vote in our election.

That the Provost chose to

publicly back one side. on an issue’

in- which he has not vote and on
which he should have maintained
strict, neiltrality is reprehensible‘.

short run, in the long rim it would strengthen faculty, which is good for
students.” “Student proposals at the bargaining table would be voted
down anyway.” “Faculty interests are the same as student interests.”

Are these the same faculty that instruct students so they can take an
intelligent role in the activities of society?

Are these the same faculty who are tired of having no “input” in‘

administration affairs? Yes. 5,

Are these the same faculty that sneer at suggestions that
administration and faculty interests are similar? Yes.

The contradictions speak for themselves. The faculty unions referred
to here have revealed that in the guise of a benevolent change in
decision-making at Pitt, students are faced with the same old message:
Get your own gun or get out.

There can be no consolation in the thought of electing a union that
doesn't clearly advocate student participation at the bargaining table.
It's obvious a change is needed in the way decisions are made at Pitt.

While faculty unionizaton holds a certain amount of promise for
students, that, unfortunately, is all students have at this

time—promises.

Students and faculty must take whatever steps "are necessary
tomorrow and Wednesday to ensure no faculty union unresponsive to
student concerns wins election on this campus.

What is worse is that he chose to
back an element whose hypocrisy
stinks to heaven: , out of their

mouths come words like “coll ' _

5-

giality” and “moral” and “rati'orx~“-=‘s‘\"

A al," but it was one of their own, the

chairman of the chemistry depart-
ment, who chasedout of “his”
building—when "did he get pro-
prietary rights-+graduate students
who were engaged in the absolut-
ely rational and moral activity of
preelectioneering. -It is doubly
demeaning for the provost in
involve himself, ﬁrst, where he had
no business, and second, where the

language is the language of noble ‘

intent and the actions are those of

petty dictators. What we need, it '

seems, is less quasi-excellence and
pseudo-collegiality and more hu-

manely informed intelligence.  §‘

That the provost chose to support’

resources of his office is a violation
of fiduciary trust and a most
serious misallocation of University’
funds. We at the PPU rent an

- office and buy our own paper; we

are running against three other
agents for representation.- For the
University to take an official policy
and to use its funds to back one
party is an irresponsibility that
cannot go unchallenged by faculty
or ’students. If any of my
colleagues (those who teach, not

those who administer) still wonder. »

why we need a union at Pitt, let
Smith's actions be the answer: we
need a union to keep administra-
tion honest, to make sure that they
do their job, and not interfere with
the activities of faculty; to mak
sure that student and state moneys
go for educational programs and
not for politicking against the will
of the majority of the faculty.
There can be neither legitimacy nor
respect when there is questionable
behavior.

Are my interests the same those
of administration? Fellow collea-
gues, ask yourselves the same
question that I asked myself: Since
a vote for TIF is a vote for the
administraion, do I really want the
administration to represent me, or
do I want people with like interests
to represent me? I want me to
represent mc.

 Minorities and
Union Bargaining

As the University faculty go’ to H

the polls tomorrow and the next
day to decide the issue of collective
bargaining or unionization, the
issue of black and other minority

people’s security becomes crucial V

and needs to be clariﬁed.
- In the long historical haul toward
,...§.uality, opportunity and responsi-

’ fility, many historical forms .of

action have arisen in the protection
of black minority interests. In the
long view it is out of the ferment of
black, minority and worker. pro-
gress that the unions emerged as a
form, but this is not our primary
concern at this moment.

5 We are_ presentaly concerned
with the much shorter view;

beginning with the emergence of

the Civil Rights movement and
speciﬁc aspects of the black power,

black consciousness revolutionary
humanist movement which result- -

ed in a signiﬁcant black minority
presence on this
campuses throughout the nation.
In these terms signiﬁcant means
;¢‘04}Tpre, better ‘and more better
" ~6‘rganized' self-afﬁrmative black

minority constituencies. (For sure’

the black minority presence in
higher education _in America
continues to be minimal; thus, the
nature of institutional racism.)
Most important however, is the
fact that whatever gains have been

and other

made, have been made as a result
of the ﬁbilant action of the black
minority community itself. Speciﬁ-
cally the self-afﬁrmative vigilance
and activity of the black community
of Pittsburgh, on-campus and off,
has resulted in an inreased access
to this University at the profes-
sional teaching, nonteaching and
student levels. (We need not
delude ourselves reference pesonal
qualiﬁcations; many of us had been
personally qualiﬁed in the past and
had continued to deliver mail and
open the doors to Cadillacs for

‘others. Finally, we are qualiﬁed

and we only have the opportunity to
properly apply these qualiﬁcations
to the extent that we are vigilant
and politically active!)

Vigilant black action has also
resulted in increased, interface
between University resources and
the black indigenous communities
of the city and locale. (Though to be
sure, ‘a subtle, unannounced
retrenchment has occurred inmost
areas, there remains a sense of
power ‘among the black/minority
communities here.) ,

While a casual scrutiny of the
campus appears to reveal a
fragmentized and personalized
power base, there is still solidly
existent the self-afﬁrmative politi-
cal dynamite of mass action. Yet,
again, this is a'tool among the
weaponry of academic and political
self-sufﬁciency which all hesitate to
utilize, it is, in objective terms,
merely the right to strike, as seen
through other historical circum-
stances, disruption.

The question of black/minority

 

people's security within the collec-
tive _bargaining system at Pitt has
to be addressed to the issue of
“base of power."

At present the afﬁrmative action
programs on campus receive the
least priority. This is due not only
because the ofﬁcer in charge is
administratively appointed and has
been since the inception of the
ofﬁce. yet also because of the
general subjection of the affected
minorities and faculty - to the
dictatorship of the University
administration (control of appoint-
ments and tenure on most minority
programming is in the hands of the
administration).

To effectively tackle the afﬁrma-
tive action issues, therefore, it is
obvious that black people and other
minorities need ﬁrst to join in the
struggle-to regain administrative
power through collective bargain-
ing or unionization (which is
another vehicle for effectively
articulating and systemitizing the
described on-going struggle of the
black/minority communities at the

' University)‘.
So far, . only the PPU has_

provided for an-.afﬁrmative- action
committee-which, in order to be
effective, must be controlled by
black/minority conscious workers
on campus. Black/minority faculty
workers must demand that other
unions and bargaining agents
create such committees and make it
clear their intentions to give over
such concerns to the affected
black/ minority communities.
Issues which affect the black and
minority communities will be
issues of access, governance,

power and permanence, i.e., initial’

hiring, rank, title, salary, tenure,
abilities to control and define
programs which effect their con-
stituencies and participation in the

. general governance of the Univer-

sity.

We feel that only by integrating
_our efforts for the success of
collective bargaining and maintain-
ing an effectively vigilant and
self-affirmative black/minority
community, will the interests of all
workers (teaching\and nonteach-
ing) be guaranteed on this and

.regional campuses of the Univer- ,

sity of Pittsburgh.

The satisfaction of the aspira-
tions of any faculty (black/ minority
and otherwise) or administrators
(chairmen being barred ‘from
representing their colleagues and
others so afﬁicted need seriously to
think of their own professional
bargaining needs as do students,
graduate and undergraduate. . . .
what if, the Student Union really
was...!) lies in bringing about his
elevation _of faculty power and

responsibility.

It appears that the upcoming
elections must need afford a
self-affirmative black minority
community the opportunity to
maintain itself along necessary line
of power and inﬂue_nce.- Certainly
the arguments pro and con
(particularly con), union or anti-
union (particularly anti-) make it
clear as black spokesmen/women
proclaimed in the '60s “that the
University is ﬁnally a political
institution, harboring certain poli-

; tical interests in dominant positions
.and having an intended result- of

spreading the ideology of the status
quo.” .

It remains clear that within the
stagnant quotes, threats of re-
trenchment and assaults upon the
quality of black/minority self-in-
terests; that a vigilant black/ minor-
ity community must take care of
itself, otherwise it becomes a target
community.

Br CRIS HALL

‘ ~-. What they lacked in number,

they made up for in enthusiasm.
Five of Pittismore game Greeks

sat down before plate upon plate of

ice cream yesterday ‘ afternoon,

, hoping to bring -fame and glory to _

their respective fraternities or
sororities and make some money
for charity while doing it.

The rules governing the second
‘annual Alpha Epsilon Pi-Delta Phi
Epsilon Ice Cream Eating Contest,
held from 3 to 5 p.m. in the S.U.
Kurtzman Room, were simple—
contestants would devour as much
chocolate chip, chocolate marsh-

f‘:+~.g__4mallow, chocolate, strawberry and

1;,’

 

 

 

Vani-Ila ice‘c_r_'eam as possible in two
45 minute "sessions, with a 15

minutes break after the “first~eati_ng

period. .

The game plan called for the
fraternity or sorority which the
contestant belonged to to contri-
bute 25 cents to the Allegheny
Valley School for Exceptional
Children for each scoop consumed
by that person. And the winner
would get a trophy. ‘

Simple, right?

That's what the ﬁve hopefuls—
Drew DiMaccio and Tom O’Shea
from Delta Tau Delta, V..l. Kofﬂer
of..Theta Phi Alpha, Rob Lepre of

. Alpha Epsilon Pi and Shula Freedel

of Delta Phi Epsilon—thought
when they first embarked on their

 

seemingly happy mission.

Cries of f‘I love ice cream,”
“Boy, am I hungry,” and “Let’s
get started” ﬁlled the air as the
ﬁrst orders were taken.

“Gimme ﬁve scoops of chocolate
chip! ” shouted_ an eager DiMaccio.

Orders for “Three scoops of
chocolate marshmallow” and
“Four strawberries” ﬁlled the air.

Soon it was three o’clock, and
each of the ﬁve was face to face
with a plateful of his favorite ﬂavor.

Greek Week co-chairman Marc
Katz gave the signal, and 'they
were off, amid the popping of
ﬂashbulb and the cheering of
well-wishers. _ '

DiMaccio was the fastest starter,

-putting down his ﬁrst ﬁve scoops in

no time.

Freedel, on the other hand,~

maintained — a steady,- albeit slow,
pace,

extremes.

“I was a judge last year,”
conﬁded Freedel, “and 1.. saw
people who started offin a hurry
didn’t come back after the ﬁrst
break.” -

The contestants ate with varying
degrees of heartiness for a short

while, but soon more time was‘

being spent mashing the ice cream
than eating it.

“This stuff sure is cold,”
Greek said. “Sure is,” echoed the

Greek Week Events 

Pitt’s fraternity and sorority

.members are among the busiest‘

students on campus now, as Greek
Week is in full swing. I

Greek Week began the weekend
of Feb. 27-28 when the Greeks
sponsored a carnival at Allegheny
Center on Pittsburgh’s North Side.
Sev‘en game booths were set up and
the $315. raised was contributed to
the Allegheny Valley School for

Exceptional Children, as will be all

money raised during Greek Week.

Feb. 28 was also the day of the-
ten-mile walkathon. Seventy
walkers took part in what Greek
Week co-chairman Marc Katz
called “a pretty successful after-
noon.”

“American Firsts” is the theme

of Greek Week ’76, and banners 1,

revolving around that theme
decorated the University until the
banner judging, which took place
Friday afternoon. The Pi Lambda
Phi-Triangle-Fiji-Chi Omega coali-
tion’s depiction of King Kong

ﬁrst place. A
Saturday night’s Greek" ’Sing,

All the polls taken recently at our University indicate that a majority of our colleagues favor collective
bargaining. The fact that three organizations are competing for this pro-collective bargaining vote makes
“N‘o.Representation " the front runner at the moment. This internecine warfare must end. One organization
has attempted to effect faculty unity: PITT PROFESSIONAL UNION.

If elected the vollective bargaining agent your colleagues in the Pitt Professional Union pledge the
following plan for faculty collective bargaining unity: I ‘

PI'I"I' PIICFESSIONAI. UNION FACULTY UNITY PROPOSAL‘

I. There shall be established a Faculty Contract Committee composed of representatives of. the Pitt
Professional Union, the AAUP, and the PSEA.

II. There shall be established a joint Faculty Negotiation Committee. composed of representatives of the Pitt
-Professional Union,'the AAUP, and the PSEA. A

III. The Faculty Contract Committee will, in accordance with the Constitutionlof the Pitt Professional Union,
include representatives from schools, regional campuses, and programs included in the bargaining unit.

(4%;

 

IV. The ioint Faculty Negotiation Committee will, in accordance with the Constitution of the Pitt Professional‘ 

Union, include members from such schools, campuses, and programs when matters’ concerning their

interests are negotiated.

V. The Faculty Contract Committee shall solicit suggestions for contract proposals from ALL members of the
.-bargaining unit, irrespective of organizational membership.

VI. The contract negotiated by the,Negotiation Committee will, in accordance lwith _our Constitution,
;A be submitted to ALLindividuals within the bargaining unit for ratification by-a secretballot election.

This plan will 'preserve'the -integrity of the competing organizations, permit participation by all
sections and units within the bargaining unit, provide for a democratic ratification procedure, and enable the
faculty to present a united front at the bargaining table. To do less can only postpone the day when we can
enjoy the benefits and protections of our first collective bargaining agreement. ‘

Faculty Vote
/Tues’. - Wed.
 Unions

1‘ ‘V BYMATTHEW KENNEDY

-The faculty union elections ~
?__scheduled for tomorrow and
 Wednesday will mark the ﬁrst time
. n Pitt history that faculty will vote
I’ on the question of unionization.

’ Since the passage of state labor
Act 195 and the Temple vote for a
yimion some three years ago, union
, activity at Pitt has steadily
increased, culminating in the
. scheduled elections.

_ The elections tomorrow will be
 conducted by the Pennsylvania
/‘Labor Relations Board, and the
I ballots will be counted this coming
Thursday at 3 p.m. in the S.U,
Kurtzman Room.

At that time it will be known
‘ whether or not the runoff elections
tentatively slated for March 30 and
.31 will be required. If any one
option gets ‘one more than half of
. the votes cast, it will be declared
‘the winner.

I It is expected that regardless of
who wins, either at Thursday’s
count or a count following the
probable runoff later this month,‘
there will be a considerable amount
"of legal work required. Exactly
how many exceptions may even-
tually be ﬁled against decisions by
the State Labor Board is not known.

Some important items impinging
upon the faculty union elections
‘tomorrow and Wednesday:

j , —The State Labor Board recent-
f ly handed down a decision splitting
the University into ﬁve separate
'parts for the purpose of a labor
§ election. Those five units are: The

Medical School, the Law School,
the Graduate Schools of Health, the
Dental School and all other schools,
which were lumped into the
Provost's area. Of the five, only
the, Dental School will not be
;participating in the union decision.
 The Labor Board decision was

polling place other than the one

have not voted elsewhere.
Q.-—The options in the Provost's
area will consist of the Pitt
Professional Union (PPU), the
Pennsylvania State Education As-
_ sociation (PSEA) and the American
’.:.’- .Association of University Profes-
I sors (AAUP), as well as No
Representative. ‘
—The options in. the Graduate
 Schools of Health will consist of

tive. '"
_ --Faculty uncertain as to their
status in the election can check

f you have received any amount of
union literature, or the recent
letters,by the Chancellor and the
Provost, chances are you are
eligible to vote.

AAUP

Seth Spaulding serves
as the current head of the
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP). The AAUP is
on the ballot’ in the Provost's area
and in the Gradute Schools of
Public Health. ..

Q: What changes would the AAUP
make in the tenure and awards
system at Pitt?

A: The general positions we’ve
taken will be polished by the full
membership after the elections,
but all kinds of awards at Pitt must
be dealt with by peer review. That
review should be reasonably ﬁnal.
We don’t reject administration
input, it’s just that faculy judgment
should carry more clout. We also
must push for more clear-cut
procedures and a decentralization
of awards systems to the depart-
ment level.

Q: What changes would the AAUP
make in grievance procedures at
Pitt? - V

A: Grievance procedures need to
be more deﬁned. The system we
are looking for would be mostly
internal, with a time limit set for
each step. A grievance would go to
binding arbitration so that faculty
members‘could have answers to
their grievances with two or three
months.

Q: How would the AAUP deal with
academic issues? /

A: Academic issues must remain in
the hands of the faculty. So as ‘far
as we’re concerned it is not a
bargainable issue. We would build
up existing senate committees by
writing them them into the
contract; right _now they’re just
advisory bodies.

Q:How would the AAUP deal with
management issues?

A: Act 195 deﬁnes what the’

administration must bargain about,
but doesn’t ultimately limit what
may be dealt with between a union
and administration. There is a legal
precedent in this state for faculty

PSEA

Don McBurney, is
serving» as the head of the
Pennsylvania State Education As-
sociation (PSEA). The PSEA is on
the ballot in the Provost's area, the
Medical School and the Graduat
Schools of Health area. - A
Q. What changes would the PSEA
make in the tenure and awards
system at Pitt?

A: Procedures for faculty tenure
and awards will be established and
set down in a contract to put teeth
_in them. It will be a faculty
decision as to who merits what in
terms of tenure, merit and awards.
We don’t see changing the way
these ‘decisions are made unless
faculty want achange.

Q: What changes would the PSEA
make in grievance procedures at
Pitt?

A: The ﬁrst step is to go through
established procedures in the
departments and schools and then

a unit-wide grievance hearing-
. Finally the grievance will

be
submitted to binding arbitration by
an unbiased third party.

Q: How would the PSEA deal with
academic issues?

A: First of all, we must establish
the authority of faculty in academic
issues through the union, by
setting down the current system in
writing, to back it up with union
support.

Q: How would the PSEA deal. with
management issues?

A: Well, ﬁrst off, the talk about
Act 195 is a smokescreen. Those
‘things which touch on the terms
and conditions of employment of
faculty are open to union interest
and at Pitt that could be almost
anything. The University could
bargain with _us on anything; we
don’t think this will be the ﬁrst
‘University to pull a strict deﬁnition
of Act 195 out of the hat. ‘

Q: How would the PSEA deal with
wages? “

SETH SPAULDING

discussion of management-type

issues where it impacts on faculty

working conditions and terms of

employment. Besides, I don’t think
the administraiton would withdraw
from discussing these matters.
Q: How would the AAUP deal with
wages?

A: To become more competitive as
a University we must raise salaries
over a period of time, but this can’t
be some dramatic raise overnight.
it will take patience and work. We’
do need salaires indexed to the cost
of living, merit funds allocated by
peer groups for outstanding faculty
work. and inequity funds to correct
salary inequities in certain areas,
for instance the case of women
faculty.

Q: How would the AAUP avoid an
adversarial, relationship with ad-
ministration? ‘

A: As faculty learn the tricks of the -

trade I think there may actually
come a withering away of profes-
sionals, except when_there is a
particularly knotty problem,
Q: How would the AAUP inﬂuence
decision making in Harrisburg?
A: Faculty should get out to
Harrisburg; having the faculty
straight-talking with the legislators
with what we need right _now. Then
“they can see- what we are
committed to as a research
university. This must be done in
concert with the University.

    

DON MCBURNEY

A: Obviously we want a signiﬁcant
increase in compensation and we
would bargain on minimum pay
scales, cost of living and merit
increases. We would establish
peers as those who determine merit
increases. The idea is that faculty
should decide about faculty.

Q: How would the PSEA avoid an
adversarial relationship with ad-
ministration?

A: If the University says “don’t
unionize because you’ll create an
adversary relationship,” you have
to realize it's a smoke screen. The
fact we have to organize indicates
we already have an adversary
relationship with the administra-
tion. When it comes to bargaining,
however, if the University refuses
to talk with us then they will have
made the adversary relationship;
otherwise it will be simple
negotiations between intelligent
people.

Q: How would the PSEA inﬂuence
decision making in Harrisburg ?
A: The PSEA is the most effective
lobbying force in Harrisburg. We
have a staff of seven lobbyists, and
it's like-a time-sharing computer.
Some have accused us of having too
many interests, but with time.

PPU

Van Beck Hall is serving as
current head of the Pitt Profession-
al Union (PPU). The PPU is on the-
ballot only in the Provost’s area.
Q: What changes would the PPU
make in the tenure and awards
system at Pitt?

A: We would try to make two basic
changes in the University tenure
and award system; ﬁrst, that
criteria for tenure and awards be
made more speciﬁc and, second,
that we reduce the role administra-
tion plays in these sort of decisions.
The idea is to get faculty input up

' there. .

Q: What changeswould the PPU
make in grievance procedures at
Pitt? '

A:" Well there is no grievance
procedure, now. We’d have to set
up an informal internal procedure
that has deﬁnite channels and
steps with eventual outside binding
arbitration. ~ Other factors are to
actually deﬁne what we mean by a
“grievance/’e to limit the time at
any one step and to limit the
number of ' steps so a faculty
member can get fast action on the
grievance.

Q: How would the PPU deal with
academic issues?

A: The bylaws of the University
generally leave the decision on
academic matters to the-faculty at
the school level. I can’t see any
change in that except to set these
sorts of things down in a contract.

Also we'd have to increase the '

scope and responsibility of the
Senate and Senate Council, es-
pecially concentrating on those
areas of the Senate that will have
more effectiveness. .

Q: How would the PPU deal with
management issues?

A: Act 195 actually has rubber
walls to it and doesn’t limit ”
discussion on other matters not set
down in the act. Besides that, any
union movement that draws sup-
port from a lot of faculty-can put on

Ned Arnett
is

appear on any ballot but

advocating that faculty vote “No 

Representative,” or no union.

Q: What impact will unionization .

have on tenure and awards at ‘Pitt?

A: The important thing is that no .;
one can tell for sure; if you go by 

what happens at other universities,
the whole system will become a lot
more complicated than it is right
now. There are fewer occasions of
ﬂagrant injustice, but we have
relatively few of these anyhow. The
point is that once lawyers get
involved, well, trouble -is their
business. They begin to encourage
- every grievance in sight. As faculty
try to avoid controversial situation
the standards are relaxed and the
quality of the faculty suffers.
Q: How will unions affect the
management and academic issues
of Pitt?
A: How will unions affect manage-
ment? Well, that's still being
thrashed out in the courts and
that's where the gray area comes
in- Not everyting you write a
position paper on can be bargained
at the table. A union can’t promise
to, cover all of the ground the
University Senate does with legal
teeth; there are some things, such
aas bread and butter issues, but
. other than that no one can be sure.
In academics the Senate is involved
right now in many areas that a
union might have a hard time
pressing a case in, for instance
freedom and tenure, the library,
the budget and other matters. V
Q: What changes do you think the.
unions will make in wages at Pitt?
A": Again no one can predict for
sure. But look at these options.

everyone knows. to state money,
tuition money, research grants and

we may have our disputes, faculty
are going to -have a great deal to
say about the management of this
University through many pressures

that we’re looking for in terms of

'Q: How would the PPU avoid an_ _

adversarial relationship with ad-‘-

ministration?

A: Right now I can think of a couple
of places where there will be a lot of
union and administration coopera-
tion, as a matter of fact. The

University needs more money from '

Harrisburg and the union must
cooperate there, and both the union
and administration I think are
trying to strenghten the University.
Q: How would the PPU inﬂuence
decision-making in Harrisburg?

A: As a union we work with the
state-wide AFL-CIO and the AFT
groups around this. area, and we’re

all working for long-term policies 

for higher education. These are"
very powerful groups and I feel in
the long run the association will
prove beneﬁcial to the University.

unions are clamoring about their
clout, clout which is still a matter of
great debate. Now, if state money
doesn’t increase, you cut back
facilities, which -nibbles at the
research grants and the contribu-
tions you receive. What does this
leave? Tuition. .

In short if the state promises of the
unions don’t materialize on sche-
dule and the University is forced to
lock up increasing amounts of
money in a contract the overall

effect will be to decrease the money -

available for important support
functions and the hiring of junior
faculty. '
Well, I suppose we can look
forward to all sorts of feather
merchants typing up forms and
writing memos to each other.

Q: What is the TIF alternative to
unionization in solving some of the
problems facing Pitt. ‘

A: Simply a stronger faculty
senate. A faculty senate with guts.
In our ﬁnal handout to faculty, the
TIF says that this is really the job
we must _get down to after this
.union stuff is over. In fact, we’ve
been wasting precious time on this
union stuff because the real issue is
revitalizing and reconstituting the
senate system. We need a
representative senate along _ the

guidelines that are before the

inertia, devised by the earliest
scholars of pie-throwing. Trans-
lated, it reads: “For each action of
insanity (handing a pie to a college
student) there is an equal and
opposite reaction of insanity
(namely, seeing the same pie
rubbed into someone’s face).”

Using this fundamental law, I
ﬁgured it would ‘be- simple to
accurately determine the level of
craziness of campus. The formula
was:. The more pies thrown, the
higher the level of insanity. It’s
simple inertia.

of a wobbly-jointed card table,

sign hastily taped to the front of it,
which urged people to buy a “fresh

Suddenly, his face became
distorted with disgust. He must
have noticed a few clumps of green
grass poking through the melting
shaving cream. “No, man; I
thought you had real pies for sale,”
he grumbled and started to leave.

“Wait a minute,” I said, twirling
the strawberry cream pie in front of
his nose. “This is real pie. And
you can have it if you throw one of
these other pies in someone’s
face.” . ‘

“What? You mean I’d get that
pie free?” _

“That’s right. All you have to do
is throw one of these pies at
someone—anyone. ’ ’

He looked around with a sly
smile on his face. The idea
obviously appealed to him. “I
could even throw it in your face?”

“You sure could,” I laughed
devilishly. He looked down at the
10 pies lined up on the table, right
within my grasp, and thought
better of it.

The poor fellow hemmed and
hawed for a good 15 minutes, but
he just couldn’t bring himself to
throw a pie at anyone. Finally,
rubbing his empty stomach, he left.

people to take advantage of my
offer, but the same thing happened
every time. As soon as they were

Imagine an order of 22,000 priests and brothers in 73
countries around the world. (That's a pretty big family.)

But that's what the Salesians of St. John Bosco are all
about — a large family of community-minded men dedicated
to the service of youth. (And no one gets lost.)

in the 1800’s a chance meeting between a poor
priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such
success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the
priest who brought youth back from the streets — and

back to God.

He reasoned that a program of play, learn and pray would
make useful citizens of the world. He crowded out evil with
reason, religion and kindness in a (what was then unheard of)

atmosphere of family spirit.

The ideals of St. John Bosco are still with us today. His
work goes on in boys clubs, technical and academic schools,
guidance centers, summer camps and missions. And his very

. human approach is very evident in the family spirit of the
Salesians. This is the way he wanted it. This is the way it is.
The Salesian experience isn't learned — it’s lived.

little angel whispered “naughty,
naughty” in their ears. How
depressing.

“Give me one of them pies,” a
voice demanded. I turned around
and saw a dangerous-looking
young woman marching towards
me. I cringed against the pie
stand.

“C’mon, give me one. I’m
gonna smash it right in that jerk’s
face,” I heaved a sigh of relief,
knowing she wasn’t after me, and
handed over a fresh one. I pointed
to the bottom of my sign, where the
words “Proceeds Go to Benefit

shoved ﬁfty cents into my palm.

“Thanks, miss,” I said humbly,

A happy-go-lucky fellow, wear-

looking around sinisterly. I've
always wanted to throw a pie at

to Jeff, who was still studying

“I don’t know...”

“Listen. I'll come up right

The points in favor of sanity were

 ANOPEN LETTER To THE FACULTY
     or THE UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

From Professor Edward Weir, Member of the
PSEA/NEA —Pl TT Organizing Committee

  

 

we of PSEA are charged, ‘of all things, of being in association with the faculties of public schools, com-
munity colleges, and state colleges. That is true. But as a member of the Pitt faculty, I do not feel that
the purity of my academic gown has been besmirched by such association, as some of my colleagues
apparently do. ' ' A

A

U have always assumed—and l still do—that all of us whoare engaged in the educational enterprise at what-
ever level share a mutual concern: The fullest possible development of the human potentialities of the
young and the advancement of knowledge, however distinctive our differing approaches might be. For the
life of me, I cannot comprehend how any memberof the University faculty can in good conscience support
an organizational elitism which lifts its nose and gathers its skirts and skitters primly away from-the danger
of being tainted by the touch of the plebes in other areas of the educational community.

 

N ot to be overlooked is the pragmatic advantage of being in association with hundreds of thousands of
 colleagues across the state and nation. Can the Mandarins of University administration bring that kind of
" vote to bear in the legislative battles that will increasingly determine the _future of the University? As a

political scientists, why does the Chancellor not recognize this elemental fact of political life: Academic

titles and prestige count, but votes clout. Why does the Chancellor not join hands with us in a common

struggle for the integrity of the University? ' P

A nother charge is that any contract negotiated. by PSEA at Pitt will necessarily follow the model of con-

- - tracts negotiated in the public school and state college sectors. Horror stories are rife about 12-hour teach- a . 
ing schedules, office-hour time clocks, salary schedules which make no provision for merit, de-emphasis « - ‘ - 
upon the research mission, etc., ad nauseam. Such charges are totally false. PSEA will negotiate the kind of ’ ’ "
contract which the Pitt faculty feels will meet its own unique needs, regardless of contract models establish- '
ed elsewhere. _ ~t

;..»»-. " The charge is made, that PSEA/NEA—PlTT is controlled and its policies dictated by "outsiders.” I can
attest that this charge is also totally false. We are publicly pledged to the principle of autonomy for the Pitt
faculty. From the beginning, PSEA/NEA—PlTT policy has been developed by Pitt faculty. It shall continue
to be so. Our lnterm Statement of Policies and Goals was written by faculty and went through four revi-
sions at the suggestion of faculty. It was deliberately constructed in an interim and general fashion, since we
wanted the fullest possible faculty participation in determining policy details after the election.

other organizations have stated their policies in detail before the election and before full participation of
all of the faculty in determining policy. One can assume’ that the rest of the faculty willbe required to
accept pre-structured policy if one of the other organizations should win the election.

I can personally attest from some two years of personal experience that PSEA staff members are here to
 I help us decide what we wish to achieve in the interests of the University community as a whole, and of the
5  - faculty in particular. They bring a wealth of resources, expertise, and academic dedication to this task. I see
nothing reprehensible in the fact that they are ambitious, energetic, highly trained, and reasonably well-
paid. I have no doubt that the "outsiders” which the administration hires to fight the faculty are also ambi-
tious, energetic, highly trained, and extremely well-paid. And I should certainly rather be represented in
negotiation or arbitration by skilled professionals than by sincere but naive amateurs.

Finally, PSEA/NEA—PlTT is charged with the heinous crime of being "wealthy." Faculty is told that
PSEA/NEA—PlTT is ”big business." Well, the University already is ”big business," and the administration
is increasingly seeking to manage the University in the “big business” mode|—administration as manage-
ment, faculty as workers, students as products. At the present time, the_only means available to usas we
seek to protect the University as a central institution in a humane society is for the faculty, through collec-
tive bargaining, to assert the ancient principle of col|egia|ity—”Power and authority shared among equals”-
in University governance. E

 

. The organization and the non-organization which chastise PSEA for our wealth of resources are making a

. virtue of their own necessity. They have not typically brought into the University governance process the

3-” strength that PSEA can bring. They will not be able to do so at Pitt. And the facutly will sorely need all the
strength it can command when we confront the power and wealth of the University administration.

with scepticism. Obviously, it was

atmosphere of Herman Hesse’s

of Pitt’s YMCA and is held in the
Lutheran University Center.

“Who would go to a girl-scout-
cookie-affair like that on a Saturday
night," I reasoned with a fresh-
man's _cynicism, “except high
school girls too young to cruise the
frat party route?”

Upon paying my 50 cents at the
door, my worst suspicions were
c nfirmed. The room was a
. iddling-sized, lightly painted,
and except for a few stray posters
on the wall (which reminded me of
an orthodontist’s waiting room); it
looked remarkably like a Sunday

doubles for bingo Thursday nights.

Surprise! Not only did -1 notice no

group seemed to range from early

. to mid-twenties, there were a few

middle-agers and an obvious
grandfather type at the table above
me.

Still undaunted, I decided that
these people were here for some
laughs, and I watched with
malicious anticipation as Jon
Brunelle, the magician, took the
stage.

Brunelle’s angle was to teach
magic tricks to the audience; while
he was no Doug Henning, there’s
no denying he was good, particu-
larly with his ﬁnale—the “ancient
Chinese method” of linking eight
silver rings which totally befuddled
the volunteer he’d selected from
the audience.

‘ ,_ “People have a great deal more

“They like to believe that can do it,
too. College students are my

favorite audience; They’re the first
to jump on a bad performer, but are
the first to enthuse for a good
one.” .

Greg Rosen, I found ,myself

While the duo was a bit too
countriﬁed for my taste, Martin
and Rosen played some excellent
ragtime music (including Scott

introduced a couple of sing-alongs.

Waits, Bukowski, And

BY DOUG GEBHARD

Appearing Friday and Saturday
nights in the lower lounge of the
Student Union will be America's
new folk legend and maestro of
beer-drinking—Tom Waits. Also
performing will be Perry Leopold, a
guitarist from -Philadelphia whose
style and lyrical content matches

Leopold will play the two
opening shows (8p.m.).

For the closing shows, both
nights, a very special man will be
present. He is considered the tie of

hippiedom and the beat genera- .

and figurehead of hip literati.
Bukowski is a special treat.
Waits _has said his biggest
inﬂuence is Bukowski, and anyone
familiar with Waits’ music can and
will see the link. Bukowski’s poetry
is the closest thing America has to

cannot afford to leave behind.

As for Tom Waits’ story, one
thing is certainly clear: Success
does not come overnight for the
truly talented. Waits’ vocals and
musical style have been lost in the
shufﬂe for fame in the music world.
The fallout from all the bombs
called talented cats has left Waits
crawling out of this quagmire.

__I guess I would call Waits a
pleasant mixture of Ella Fitzgerald

and Richard Daley. He has‘

Fitzgerald’s rhythm and sense of
time, but the abrasiveness of Daley
from Chicago, only in a small way.
Waits’ music recalls the roots of
contemporary rock with his small-
combo approach and jazz inﬂuence.
His poems and sonnets ﬂow
between the lines and stanzas of a

run the keg dry is common

Possible Pop Hits

BY TOM WASELESKI

Jorge Calderon, City ‘Music,
Warner Bros. BS 2904.

If you’ve heard groups called
The Vultures, The Livin’ End,
Space,_or Beans &' Rice, You’ve
heard Jorge Calderon. But most
people haven’t. A solo album-
which this is—isn’t much of a solo
album if you haven’t first heard the
group. _ _

Calderon has an obvious Latin
touch (he was born in San Juan)
that seems to turn up, at least

‘ brieﬂy in every song on the album.

He has a strong voice, the kind
you think you’ve heard before, and
can move easily into both mellow
and rocking spots. He writes his
own stuff,'arranges it, and with a
little help from. guys like Paul
Stallworth and Jim Keltner (cour-
tesy of George Harrison’s Dark
Horse label) does a freshly
fantastic job.

Calderon’.s music is about middle
range, sure to enthrall Harry
Nilsson, John Lennon, and Ameri-
can fans. A great feel for strong,
solid pop makes virtually every
track on the album a possible hit

' single.

“City Music,” the title cut, is a



well-developed piece, using strong
backup vocals from Tessie Coen
and Yvonne Rankin, who also help

, out on other songs. Calderon comes

 

off like Barry Mannilow at his nasal
best and there’s a strong horn and
drum section in the middle of the
track that lends power to the
second half of the tune. '

Corea 's NewLP-Different

i BY GEORGE FAINES

The Leprechaun, Chick Corea,
Polydor PD-6062

\ Chick ‘Corea has been doing a lot
these days. '

Down Beat « magazine’s No. 1
electric pianist and composer/ ar-
ranger for 1975. Beside touring and
recording with his band, Return to
Forever, Corea has released a very
interesting and different solo
album titled The Leprechaun.

” The Leprechaun is a very
creative album. It is full of musical
imagery and it tells the story of a
leprechaun’s ventures in its private
dream world.

The music on this album is
constantly changing and it sounds
at times like the soundtrack for a
motion picture. Corea’s previous
recordings were predominately
piano oriented, but The Lepre-
chaun finds him using a brass
section, a string quartet and vocals.
The result is a recording that is so
individual and innovative that it
cannot be classified.

“Looking At The World” and
“Soft and Gentle” feature the
beautiful vocals of Gayle Moran.
Her voice is crystal clear and
possesses a magical quality. This
is very evident on “Soft and
Gentle,” which is the fairy queen’s
love song to the leprechaun.

“Nite Sprite” is a very energetic
piece that has Corea on synthesizer
and Joe Farrell on soprano sax. The
two of them keep answering each
others’ improvisations, each one
getting more intense as the piece
builds up to its climax.

“Lenore” is the Leprechaun’s

tri_bute'to‘ his-fairy queen. Corea-

switches off on piano and synthe-
sizer and‘ really displays his

Sander’s Photo Show
  Personal Portraits

The photographs of August
Sander, one of the most remarkable
photographers of the 20th century,
are on exhibit in Gallery D at the
Carnegie Museum of Art.

Sander devoted himself to
capturing the German people with

a camera. His photographs form an .

objective portrait of the individuals
from all walks of life that made up
German society.-

Soundtrack LPs: Original and Classical  

BY PAMELA EUSI

Original Soundtrack from The
Hindenburg, MCA* MCA-2090
Music from the Soundtrack of

0 Barry Lyndon, .Wamer Bros.,
,K56l89

.0 . Sountracks from movies have
‘ .been mediocre and downright dull

lately. The soundtrack from The

" Hindenberg is an LP with some

different things to’offer if you’ll
take the chance to listen. But you

have to be into the classical area to, I "

enjoy the music from the movie

 '_ Barry ‘Lyndon.

The Hindenburg starts off with a
newsreel that sounds very authen-
tic and givesvplenty of background

by material on the airship itself. But

the interesting music comes in the
“Main Title.” The theme involves
a few woodwind solos and a soaring

spirit of the zeppelin.

“The Letter” sounds full of
mystery and intrigue. Brass choirs
break the nervousness with tense
phrases that remind me of the
segment dedicated to Mars,
bringer of war from Holst’s The
Planets.

“Colonel Ritter and The Count-

  

?/

ess’’ deals with a bland subject and
the results are even more bland.
The music is the same. Lush
strings, serve to emphasize a dead
relationship. Side two provides
more of the same. All that is
changed is the orchestration.

A song with lyrics (at last) lends
a little life in a satirical vein.
“There’s A Lot To Be Said For The
Fuehrer,” takes a few stabs at the
Nazis a la Cole Porter as the
singers ride one of the supreme
heights in Nazi achievement—the

Hindenburg.

Finally the “Retrospective and
End Title” comes after the human
misery of the explosion scene,
which are clevely spliced with shots
of the film’s actors. The eyewitness
broadcast by Herb Morrison is a
moving account of a reporter being
in the right place'at the perfect
time.

 

On the other hand Barry Lyndon
contains some really ﬁne classical
selections. Stanley Kubrick is a
master of ﬁlmmaking and he
selects all the music for his
creations personally.

If yousaw Clockwork Orange you
arrived home shuddering and
cringing every time you listened to

-  . . "SK

 

   

Beehoven afterwards. Barry Lyn-
don’s music doesn’t have this
drastic effect.

Kubrick spent over 1,000 listen- ﬂ

ing hours to choose the right pieces
for the right moments. The main
theme comes from a sarabande by
Georg Frederick Handel.

Folk music plays an interesting
part in the early half of the ﬁlm.
“Women in Ireland”
OTRiada (performed by the Chief-
tains) adds a plaintive air to Barry’s
love affairs. “Tin Whistles” by
O’Riada and the traditional “Brit-
ish Grenadier” point out more than
ever the hallowed customs and

T roots of these country folk and the

swagger and pride of the King's
Army.
If your taste in soundtracks runs

.in the classical vein, or in the

originality of the Hindenburg’,
you’ll enjoy these LPs.

  Bulletin No. 7

 Thoughts on Election Eve

OUR PREDICTION: On March 9 and 10, faculty members, research associates, and librarians in the Provost's area will cast
votes of decisive important for the future of Pitt as a major university. Welpredict that, provided two conditions are met, a
majority of the voters will cast their ballots for NO REPRESENTATIVE, thereby extending the unbroken string of defeats
dealt to unionism by the faculties of the leading universities that make up the.Association of American Universities. .

The first condition is that all eligible persons vote. The second is that they vote their true convictions.

We are concerned, for example, by those who oppose faculty unionization but who hesti.tate to vote NO REPRESEN-
TATIVE for fear that their votes will be interpreted either as a vote of confidence in the Administration or as indicative of
satisfaction with the status quo. We wish to remind them that there are far more constructive ways to express their dissatisfac-
tion with the Administration than by saddling their colleagues with a union.

Why are we confident? Consider these facts. The only impartial public survey oflfaculty attitudes toward unionization
at Pitt, a study conducted in Marcy, 1975, by 18 undergraduates under the supervision of Professor AMi‘ch‘ae| Margolis of the
Department of Political Science, revealed that, exclusive of Medical School faculty, 43%~of the faculty reject unionization, 2‘-4%

   support the AAUP, 13% PPU, 7% PSEA, with, I 3% undecided or unin-teirested.‘ Doubtless these percentages have changed some-

what”oi/erfthe‘ past year.as faculty members have.become"'ino're informed about collective bargaining. Still it is plausible to infer
that the number of faculty who now reject‘ unionization outright is at least equal to the combined support of the three unions,
as it was in. March, 1975. This inference is probably conservative in view of the substantial number of faculty members in the
Provost's areawho have publicly identified themselves with TlF’s position, the decisive defeats suffered by unionism at all other
AAU universities (at Nebraska and NYU within the past two weeks), and the weakness of the case for unionization as presented
by the three contending unions. These facts suggest the March 9-10 election will result in a NO REPRESENTATIVE victory.
And that is just what we think will happen, provided only that faculty -members turn out to vote and then vote their true
convictions. V . ' -

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AAUP. We acknowledge the debt that university facultyowe the AAUP. For nearly, three-quar-
ters of a century the AAUP has fought for academic freedom, forthe‘ principles-of tenure and due process, and for adquate com-
pensation. The academic profession would be mu_ch poorer,‘both literally and figuratively, had there _not been an AAUP. Yet we
"must not get our gratitude cloud our perception of how the AAUP achieved its impressive successes. In every case they were
. accomplished by the power'and persuasiveness of academic values, not by the tactics of collective bargaining. Indeed, we suspect
that the authority of the AAUP to speak for the academic profession is compromised when some of its chapters turn to union-
, ization. We urge faculty, therefore, to distinguish the Pitt chapter of the AAUP qua professional society chapter from the Pitt
chapter qua union local. We oppose only the union local. ' - ‘ ‘

A few faculty members who oppose unionization have speculated that they should perhaps vote for the AAUP union
local just’ to keep the AFT (PPU) and the NEA (PSEA) out of Pitt. They fear a run-off election between PPU and PSEA. We be-
lieve this strategy unwise -and their fear unwarranted. Note, firstyhow little support PPU and PSEA have been able to muster.
There is little danger that we will have an AFT or NEA local bargaining for us. Second, note that the presidents of all three
‘unions have predicted that there will be a run-off election between NO REPRESENTAT_lVE~and‘one of the Unions. So a run-

— off election—if there were to be one—would probably pit AAUP against NO REPRESENTATIVE, not PPU against PSEA. But ~
even in theunlikely event that the AAUP lost out in the first election to one of the other unions, AAUP members could vote
solidly for NO REPRESENTATlVE‘and against the’PPU or PSEA in the run-off.

.aw1- uucra.::;.-€:a4-iv:'...;z-.&.L;::.:..*m;i.~t.....aa:- ; =...'.-..u.- .«  . ~ ..: ~,: 3 . ,'

' A “NO REPRESENTATIVE” VICTORY. We have predicted a NO REPRESENTATIVE victory and explained our reasons for

expecting it. We are unhappy, however, with, the word “victory.” A vote for no agent in no way indicates contentment with the

’ . status quo. There is, nevertheless, a measure of truth in the unions’ claim that of itself a vote for no agent is no guarantee of
change. A union vote does indeed guarantee change, but, we think, change for the worse.

What, then, do we stand to gain by voting NO REPRESENTATIVE? For one thing, we avoid a backward step. For an-
other, we gain time to put our collegial house in order, time to make our administration more sensitive to faculty interests and
concerns, time to resolve many of the bona fide grievances pointed out by the unions. If the energies and talents that have gone
into the efforts to unionize Pitt had been turned toward these tasks, we might be farther along in solving many of the problems
that beset us. a ' , _

The Univer's’itySenate, its Council, and its Committees have lately shown signs of becoming viable instruments of faculty
initiative and consensus. Witnesstheir recent actions on the budget, on tenure for part-time faculty, and on library appropria-
tions. We are encouraged by these developments because we believe in a collegial university where administrative officers, them-
selves part of the faculty, reponsibly carry out institutional policies framed by the faculty. Unionization would invert this rela-
tionship .by defining faculty as employees and administration as employer. In so doing unionization would bury the collegial
model of the university beyond hope of resurrection. -

Our immediate challenge is to defeat unionization. Then comes our real challengezl to breathe new life into the idea of a
collegial university at Pitt. '

  Recruits-Prizes

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

 

It.has been rumored the Pitt Panther basketball program is on the
upswing. Has anyone wondered how the Cats intend to make that jump
item the also rantothe, nationfs oligarchy? , . _, _ , , _

E Panther coaches Tim Grgurich, Bob Hill, and Fran Webster have.
3 And in one of the most aggressive recruiting campaigns in the school's
Erecent history, thecoaches have decided to do something for Pitt's
Evaulting ambition. V
5 Two years ago, Grgurich, as chief recruiter, landed a prospective
lksuperstar in Melvin Bennett and the Panthers were onvtheir way to an
Q18-11 season and a trip to the National Invitational Tournament in New
} York's Madison Square Garden.

 Last year Grgurich plucked a 7-foot center named Kelvin Smith from

I  hearby Schenley High and the Cats seemed destined to succeed their

 two straight tournament berths with another. Unfortunately, Smith
i:=was declared ineligible, and the 1975 campaign went downhill from
.'-'.there.

 Now it.’s the 1976 recruiting season, and the coaches have been
' iunior-college talent that will nick the Panthers up again.

’ The basketball ofﬁce has issued one name to date and a ﬁne start it
is. The player is 6-8 forward Mike Rice of Maryland.

This, however, is not to say that Rice is deﬁnitely coming to Pitt next
fall. He has signed a letter of intent, but those letters aren’t binding
until sometime in mid-April. Rice is an excellent ballplayer and is
sought by many of the country's basketball elite, most notably Left
Drisell of Maryland. The Panther front office is a little reluctant to say:
“Yes, he's ours.”

“I was in Maryland just last week,” Assistant coach Webster said.
‘'1 don’t foresee any problems at the moment, and Mike has given me
every indication that he will play for us next season.”

One can’t help recall a similar situation last year, when the Cats had
all-star center Phil Hubbard all but signed. He was all set to come here,

-but at the last minute—well, to make a long story short, freshman
Hubbard is now starting center and averaging 15 plus points per game
with the Michigan Wolverines.

But Rice isn't the only crop the Panther coaches hope to reap this
recruiting season. The list of talent in the Western Pennsylvania are
alone is enough to make any coach drool with insane delight and give
him delusions of roundball supremacy.

, ‘ running rampant across the country, looking for that high-school and

Galore In WPIAL

And there are a number of reasons why that basketball talent might _

well be lured to Pitt. One of those is not the Pitt facilities.

“Sure, we don’t have the arenas that South Carolina, Notre Dame or
some of the other top schools have,” Webster said. “But we do have a
few factors going our way.

“The ﬁrst is our schedule. We play a major college schedule, which ’

will include both Cincinnati and Maryland athome next year. And now

‘- we have a division of our own, which will promote our rivalries with

Penn State, Duquesne, and West Virginia, as well as‘ bring George
Washington and Rutgers to the Field House. The East indies will be a
tough division to win, and the exposure we'll get on the East Coast will
really beneﬁt the program.”
So how about these hot-shot high school blue chippers?
“We have a lot of leads right now,” Webster said, with an air of
confidence in his voice. “We’re recruiting for positions right now and
can offer maybe as many as six scholarships this year, but if we corral
three or four of our top prospects, we'll be happy.”
Perhaps the top prospect on the Panther’s list is a center. And
around these parts lurks the makings of a potential All-American in
Baldwin's 6-11 Ed Scheuermann. All Scheuermann did last week in
kBaldwin’s stirring first-round WPIAL tournament win over Laural
Highlands, was score 37 points, pull down 19 rebounds and block six
shots. He had a decent night.

. “We’ve been talking to Ed a lot recently,” Webster said. “Actually,
has been following himfor, a‘ couple of years now.,I know he

figure out,

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

There are three inevitable things
in life—_death, taxes and ﬁghts at
Pitt-Carnegie-Mellon (C-MU)
hockey games. Why people die and
why we pay taxes are enough ‘to
without having to
explain why Pitt and Carnegie-.Mel-
lon can’t play a clean hockey game.

It was a good, clean, hard-check-
ing game, until the 9:41 mark of the
ﬁnal period, when things all of a
sudden turned sour (or,-if you’re a
boxing fan, got swe'eter.). I

The fisticuffs started when
C-MU’s Dave Cornelius slashed
Pitt goalie Larry Newill at the side
of the Panther goal. Then, when
Newill’ attempted to get. to the
bench on the delayed penalty call in
favor of a sixth attacker, Cornelius
caught up with Newill again and
high-sticked him.

Now, there’s one thing you don’t
get away with in hockey and that’s
picking on a goalie. Several Pitt
players went to the aid of Newill
and that’s when the, ﬁreworks
began. Oh, yes, Pitt won the game
8-2, but that fact seems to take
second-place to the question of who
won the ﬁght/s. ‘

Pitt came out on top, in each of
four main events. Rick Vernon took
care ‘of Jim Morse, while Jeff
Saunderskdecisioned his opponent.
Then Frank Scuilli‘, the ‘Tartans’
small goaltender, made the mis-
take of his life by hitting Pitt’s
rugged defenseman, Russ Stump,
in the face with his goalie’s stick.
Stump easily avenged the action
before Newill and C-MU’s Larry
Steuver started to go at it.

The referees, who stood and

watched while all the ﬁghts were in A

progress, ﬁnally took some action
when they decided to call the game
with over ﬁve minutes remaining.
It wouldn't have mattered anyhow
—C-MU was halfway to the locker
room by then.

Though the Panthers are not the
cleanest players in‘ hockey, they
can't be blamed for their actions at
the Civic Arena yesterday. Starting
the fighting is one thing, ﬁnishing

' it (though it should’t be condoned)

is a whole other story.

“All Russ told the Carnegie
goalie was ‘get out of my way,”’

Pitt coach Len Barcalow said. “He '

then hit Russ on the face with his
stick. From then on it was a
one-round knockout.” _

Before the ﬁghting began, the
Panthers had rolled up a 6-0 lead in
the first two periods. After Pitt
failed to muster much of an attack
in the opening moments, _Curt Hetz
opened the scoring with 1:02
remaining in the ﬁrst period- by
taking =a pass from Vernon behind
the net and putting it by Scuilli.

The Panthers wasted no time
extending the lead in the second
frame. AFter only 11 seconds, Gary
Fries scored his eighth goal of the

A season on a wrist shot from 10 feet

away. Vernon did the same thing
22 seconds later to give Pitt a 3-0
margin. ‘ " " V .

Defenseman Rick 'Petracca
scored his ﬁrst goal of the season a
minute later, taking the draw from
a face-off and driving home a
35-footer with the Panthers .a man
short.

After Newill was forced to come

up with some big saves on good

shots from C-MU‘ players milling
around unmolested in front of the
Pitt goal, Vernon put on a show for
the small gathering of spectators.’
The Panther captain picked up a
loose puck at the Tartan blue line,

stepped" around on defender and

faked another, before launching a

You can’t help but pick the Red “ ’

have not lost anything in the

bolster a rotation of Luis Tiant, Bill

The Sox’ pitching has been

of Jenkins should solidify the staff,

good shot at signing him.”

The problem right now, as far as getting aplayer to make any
deﬁnite decision, is that most of these top-notch players are in the

midst of their tournament schedules.

Another top prospect comes out of Tom Richard’s alma mater, Moon
Twp. high school. He's a 6-2 guard named Joe Fryz, whom Coach Hill
called “probably the hardest worker, as far as basketball goes, that

I've ever come in touch with.”

Fryz’s statistics, "25 points per game, compare favorably with
another Pitt prospect, Valley High’s Baron “BB” Flenory, the WPIAL
scoring leader at a 28-point per game clip. In his team’s ﬁrst round
game, he_equaled the mark set the night before by Scheuermann,

tossing in‘ 37 points.

talked a few times with a couple of excellent prospects in Chicago, and

NEW YORK

The Yankees gave up a lot when
they traded Bobby Bonds, but the
addition of Doc Ellis, Ken Brett and
Ed Figuera to a pitching staff of
“Catfish” Hunter, Rudy May and
Larry Gura could make up for that
loss, although it will be hard. The

ctandem of Dick Tidrow and Sparky
Lyle provides. a tremendous one-
two punch from the bullpen.

Another addition to New Yor_k’s
pretenders to the Eastern Division
crown is the ﬂeet-footed Mickey
Rivers. Rivers stole 70 bases last
season, had a .282 batting average,
and should replace Elliot Maddox
in centerﬁeld. Maddox may be
traded, since he and manager Billy
Martin don’t seem to get along.
Maddox has already been traded
from two Martin teams.

If Maddox is not traded, the
outﬁeld of Rivers, Maddoxand Ray
White is- sound, although Oscar
Gamble and Lou Piniella may
challenge those positions.

Gamble’s power potential (15
homers in limited play with
Cleveland) could earn him the job.

BALTIMORE

The Orioles made no trades in
the off-season, showing that they
have plenty of conﬁdence in their
present players. Jim Palmer, last
year’s Cy Young Award winner,
leads a staff of Mike Torrez, Mike
Cuellar, Ross Grimsley and Doyle
Alexander.

This mound staff is much better
than that of _the Red Sox, but
unfortunately the birds do not have
the tremendous hitting the Sox
possess. Paul Blair may be the
best centerﬁelder in the American
League, but his hitting does not
measure up to that of his American
League rivals. Mark Belanger is a
ﬁne shortstop, but his hitting can
only be described as anemic.

Remember Brooks Robinson, the
perpetual winner of the Golden
Glove Award? Well, that star
faded last year with a .201 batting
performance, and at age 38 it is
doubtful whether or not the old
man has any good years left in him.

Ken Singleton, Lee May, Don
Baylor and.Tommy Davis provide
all the power for the Orioles, but
that’s not going to be enough to
unseat the Red Sox. Unless the
Orioles can come up with replace-
ments for Blaire, Robinson and
Belanger, the Birds willcontend
but shouldn’t go very far.

talent to work with this season,

Pantherettes Third  
In EAIAW Swimming

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Just as Mark Spitz was the big
name for the University of Indiana
swimming team, Kathy Stetler is
the star in Pitt’s lineup. While the
Pantherette entries in the Eastern
Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (EAIAW)
swimming and diving champion-
ships accumulated 329 points
collectively for a third-place ﬁnish,
super-freshman Stetler was third to
no one (and second only once—in
the 200 yard freestyle). V

She captured three first-places-
the 50-yard frestyle (:24.255),
50-yard butterﬂy (:26.181) and the
100-yard freestyle (:52.732).

Setting new EAIAW records in
both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyles, Stetler shared top
honors with Princeton’s Lis Os-
bourn, who also hit the top slot
three times with victories in the
50-, 100-, and 200-yard breastroke.

Rutgers ﬁnished first overall

‘with 711.5 points and Princeton

followed with 529.5. West Chester
(287) and Penn State (267) ﬁnished
fourth and ﬁfth respectively, and

Surprisingly, with such giants as
Princeton and Rutgers hitting the
water, tiny Clarion State College
completely dominated the one- and
three-meter diving, with Chris
Seufert claiming ﬁrst place in both
events. Clarion also placed four
divers in the top seven places in the
three-meter. Pitt’s Connie Heister
took ﬁfth in the event.

All-American Angie Lopez
brought in the Pantherettes’ only
other second place for the 50-yard

breastroke. Christy Elston came in-

ﬁfth in the 200-yard freestyle and
14th in the 50-yard backstroke.

Pitt also captured third in two
relays. Both teams were anchored
by Stetler.

“I’m very satisﬁed with their
performances,” Pantherette coach
Kate Mathison said of her team.
“We entered only eight partici-
pants against Rutgers’ 16 and
Princeton’s 14, and we placed in
every event.”

The next stop for Stetler, Elston,
Lopez, Heister, Jennifer Price,
Jenny Brooker, Nila de Jesus, and
Jamie Conley is the National’s

Bailey Hits “Big Time”

BY JIM LEWIS

It's a story which would make
Cinderella proud.

In the past couple of years, Bob
Bailey’s name was not a familiar
one in the Pitt wrestling‘ team's
starting lineup. He only started
eight times last season.

And why not?" With wrestlers
like Kevin Nellis and George
Bryant (now an assistant coach)
ahead of him, it would be
impossible for Bruno Samartino to
try to crack into the starting
rotation.

But this year, Bailey got his
chance to start regularly. And he
made the most of it.

Bailey, who compiled a 14-5
record this year and helped the
19-ranked Panthers to a 12-4
record, is one of ﬁve Pitt wrestlers
who will participate in the NCAA
championships in Tuscon, Ariz.,
next Thursday and Friday. The
ﬁve include Kevin Nellis (118),
Rande Stottlemyer (134), George
O’Korn (167) and Bill Bailey (190),
along with Bob Bailey (150)..

“This is what you work for,”
Bailey said. “Dual meets are
nothing but warm-ups for nation-
als.” '

Despite his success in his
starting role, Bailey has felt he
could qualify since the season’s

“I thought I could quaIify,"
Bailey claimed. “That’s not meant
to sound cocky—that’s just a
positive attitude. If you want to do
anything, you have to set your
goals high.”

But no goal seems to be too high
for Bailey. He fought his way
determinedly through a tough ﬁeld
of 142-pounders to ﬁnish third in
the Eastern Wrestling League
tournament, thus earning himself a
berth in the NCAA’s.

“This was it—this was my senior
year. I had to do it this year,”
Bailey said.

“But I’m a bit leary. I’ve never
been to a national tournament.
Just the impression you get of a
tournament like this—it really
psyches you out. With a little luck-,
I’ll do pretty good.”

If he and the others do well, Pitt
will deﬁnitely improve on their
ranking. This team has the
potential to go places Pitt hasn’t
been to in a long time.

“Everybody’s been working
hard this year,” Bailey said.
“Everyone’s fully dedicated and
closer than we have been in the
past. We stick together—talk to
people, get others’ heads straight
when they’ve got troubles. We are

making things happen.
the potential to improve on our
ranking."

Bailey also cites the knowledge
of Bryant and Head Coach Dave
Adams as one of the reasons for the
team's success.

“Both Adams and Bryant have a
huge knowledge,” he claimed.
“They know the ropes—they’ve
both been around. "They try to
institute aggressiveness in us-—en-
courage us not to quit.”

Which is one of the many
reasons why this Pitt team is one of
the best Bailey has ever been on.

“Overall attitude, toughness anﬁéat

togetherness—~in those areas, this
is the best team I’ve been on,”
Bailey said. “We have the talent,
but we don’t have superstars—we
stick together and work hard.”

And how far can the Panthers
go?

“I don’t know,” Bailey answer-
ed, “But everybody’s been work-
ing hard for this tournament.
We’re going out there to do
something—we’re not just going
out for the trip.”

This year, we’re not going out
there to lose.”

If Bailey’s words are true, the
glass slipper will ﬁt Pitt's foot
perfectly after midnight- Friday.

ITALIAN FASCISTS CHARGED!

MILAN, Italy (AP)—Forty
seven persons including two
members of parliament have been
indicted on charges of! attempting
to revive the outlawed Fascist party
of World War II dictator Benito
Mussolini, a state prosecutor
announced Sunday.

Trial was set for April 6,
although the court needs authori-
zation from parliament to proceed
against the two legislators, Fran-
cesco Servello.and Francesco
Petronio, both members of the
rightist Italian Social Movement
Party. ‘

A 1952 law made it a crime to 15;:

attempt to resurrect the Fascist
Party. I .
