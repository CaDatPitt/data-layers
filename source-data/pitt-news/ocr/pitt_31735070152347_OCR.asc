FOOTBALL
Street’s record

day 
of last—second
loss to Navy

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

Devin Street wrappedaip his high school
playing days as anunheralded wide receiver
prospect from Liberty High School in eastern
Pennsylvania. Pitt and Connecticut were the
only Bowl Championship Series-caliber teams
that had presented offers to Street, but the
6—foot-4 wide receiver had a vision. ’

On Saturday at Navy, Street became the% I 

al1—time receptions leader in the history of
Pitt football. 1
After the game, he claimed he saw such a V

‘ feat coming.

“I accomplished what I came here to do,”
Street, a ﬁfth—year senior, said without hesi-
tation. i -

Street’s moment came early inJthe second
quarter. Deep in Pitt’s territory, he reeled in a
pass from quarterback Tom Savage, good for
7 yards and the record. .

With the catch, Street pulled ahead of Latef
Grim on the list, who penciled his name at the
top in 2000. The 5—foot—11, 185-pound Grim
shined under Walt Harris—led Pitt teams of
the late 1990s, catching 178 passes in three
seasons.

candidates, as well as campaign managers
and current Board members, in room 527
of the William Pitt Union. He designed
the workshop to inform candidates about

workshop was a mandatory event in order
for candidates to familiarize themselves
with the campaigning regulations and the
Elections Committee. ‘ l
The Elections Code, which is available
on the Board’s website, is a formal docu-

ment that contains rules for the candi-

dates’ conduct during their campaigns.
In various sections, the rules outline
qualiﬁcations necessary to run, campaign
ﬁnancing and election day.

The Elections Committee is respon-

suring that candidates abide by the rules.

According to Gish, the candidates still
have to be approved by Kenyon Bonner,
the director of Student Life, who serves
as SGB’s adviser."

ers were located as far as Champion, Pa, an
hour and a half from campus.

This year’s, PMADD saw an increase in

- participation from last year. According to
‘T Mary Mallampalli, who coordinated last

year’s PMADD, about 3,000 students at-
tended last year’s event, for which 4,000

frsigned up, and the event included 63 work

Frisch said that she did not have the of-
ﬁcial amount spent on this year’s event, but

.Mallampalli said that more than $35,000

was spent on PMADD last year.

. Participants met and signed in at the Wil-
liam Pitt Union at 9 a.m. before leaving by
bus for their assigned locations. Groups of
students, undeterred by the early start time,

T held garbage bagsor other tools while work-

ing to beautify’ neighboring communities.

Turman said that he and his brothers
from Pi Kappa Alpha plan to participate in
PMADD in future years. “The owner was
incredibly grateful that we took the time
to do what he physically was unable to do,”
he said. _ '

Sarah Cassatt, a sophomore health and
nutrition major, spent the day mulching and
planting seeds at a community garden in
East Liberty, a neighborhood in Pittsburgh’s
East End.

“It was cold, but we were working for a
great cause, so it was completely worth it,”
she said. “I wish I had become involved [with
PMADD] earlier in my [college] career.”

Although the weather was cold, students’
energy was lively and contagious.

Kristen West, a freshman social work
major, said she is excited to participate in

Turn your empathy outward: Global
conflict warrants more attention

Natalie Russell
‘ Columnist

Video footage of the conflict in
Syria went viral this past year,
providing a real-life comple-
ment to the inanimate statis-
tics we read in print. Numbers
turned into rows upon rows
of child-sized body bags. The
footage evoked a range of re-
sponses from active support
for overseas intervention —
humanitarian or otherwise
— to passive surrender, to a
feeling of powerlessness. For
Laila Al-Soulaiman, it wasn’t
just matching numbers with
distant faces, but recogniz-
able ones. She learned about
the death of her 19-year-old
“cousin from one of those You-
Tube videos.

In publications fromlthe
Post-Gazette to Pop City Me-
dia, Al-Soulaiman’s back-
ground composed a large por-
tion of the" reporting on her
public activism projects. Her
personal ties with a war-torn
country explains her empathy

toward the issue. But should-

people have to have a personal
connection to such conflicts
to feel the way Al—Soulaiman
does? Shouldn’t these videos be
enough to provoke people from
all backgrounds to experience
anger and a sense of solidarity

" A with the victims?-Asimpressive.

as she may be, Al-Soulaiman’s
personal story should pale in

comparison—to the cause she A

promotes.  virtue of being
human beings, we should all
be equally active and’morally
outraged.

‘  ' '1Narrati-ves in these publica-

tions have ranged from “look
at what‘ this young woman
has accomplished” to “look
at this poor, girl.” As almost a
knee-jerk response, journalists
seemed more drawn to her in-
spiring, overcoming-adversity
narrative than to the conflict
itself.

“I’ve become a face of the
conflict within Pittsburgh,”
said Al-Soulaiman, a Syrian-
American and‘ first-year Pitt
student, “and I don’t like it at
all.” Narratives that celebrate
young activists for their

dedication, while focusing
little attention to the cause of
raising awareness about the
suffering

in Syria itself, are part of

the problem, she said. “Peo-
‘ple want that sensationalized

story, but my story is not out
of the ordinary.”

Al—Soulaiman was born in
Dubai. Her mother is a Pitt
graduate who met her father,
a Syrian native, while visiting
the United Arab Emirates. Her
paternal family currently re-
sides in Daraa, Syria, where
the revolution started.

Her activism makes her
stand out, but the death and
suffering of her extended fam-
ily is no different than that of
the hundreds of thousands of

civilians under Syran President A

Bashar al—Assad’s regime. Since
the conflict began in'March
2011, Al—Soulaiman has lost
18 of her family members.
The Syrian Observatory of
Human Rights reportedion Oct.
1 that the death toll in the on-
going civil war is estimated to

be about 115,000. The actual
count, according to Al-Sou-
laiman, is likely much higher.
“They can’t ﬁnd the bodies,”
she said, “but nobody wants
to say that.”

Hard news such as the con-
ﬂict in Syria is often juxtaposed
with Miley Cyrus critiques and

'YouTube videos of cats, the lat-

ter of which seems to be more
popular. Just take a look at the
follower count of news sources
compared to the follower count
of celebrities on Twitter: Mi-
ley Cyrus, 14 million; The New
York Times, 9 million; Kim
Kardashian, 18 million; BBC,
4 million. This observation is
usually met with the response

that Americans are just stupid,»

but I would argue that popular
media and advertising condi-
tions us not to be troubled with
bad news. These conditions are
what make it easy to look the
other way. It’s why we all still
buy Apple products and eat at
McDonald’ .

Reading about violence and
death tolls in the Middle East
is emotionally draining and de-
pressing, and for some it may
provoke a feeling of defeat and
numbness. But Al—Soulaiman
says that’s necessary. “When
you feel pain, you experience
a capacity for empathy,” she
said. “Looking at the stuff you
don’t want to see can expand
your humanity.”

She described her journey
to activism as one largely driv-
en by emotion. “It all started

with an inability to deal with _

my emotions,” she said, “A lot of col-
lege students can understand that feel-
ing of being out of control, especially
when we’re oversaturated by the me-
dia.” Political activism was a way for
A1—Soulaiman to channel her emotions
into action. She argued’ that anyone
capable of feeling empathy is capable
of makin_g_a,d_ifferettqe.-,, ., M   K’

Students who feel empathy must
make the attempt in doing so.

Conﬂict Kitchen is one outlet Pitt
students can use to make a difference.
From programs such as the Lunch
Hour to printed excerpts of speeches
regarding important political events,
Conﬂict Kitchen is a budding activist’s
best friend. Jon Rubin, one of the pro-

prietors of Conflict Kitchen, said the

restaurant is a platform for activists
such as A1—Soulaiman. Rubin said em-

to the countries whose food it features
and conduct long—term investigations to
gain a better understanding of conflicts
overseas. Last February the company

sent three representatives to gather

information on the political environ-
ments in Cuba and North Korea.

But beyond having lunch in- Schenley
Plaza, there are plenty of ways that stu-
dents can learn more and get involved
in helping those affected by the crisis
overseas. Tonight, A1—Soulaiman, Dr.

Basel Termanini, a local physician who

was. born in Syria and Mohammed Ba-
myeh, a Pitt sociology professor, will
speak at an event called Crisis in Syria:

_ New Developments, hosted. by FORGE

Pittsburgh. The event will run from 8
p.m. to 10 p.m. in the O’Ha1a Student
Center.

Personal ties might be a catalyst for
humanitarian action, but it shouldn’t
make the involved‘ person more ethi-
cally responsible for speaking up.ﬁ

Panthers’
miscues late
cause loss in
  Annapolis

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt won’t rue the day it lost 24-21 to Navy be-
cause of the way- the Midshipmen executed
their triple-option offense. Instead, the Pan-
thers began the second half of their season
by failing to play a full 60 minutes of football
as Navy scored 10 unanswered points in the
game’s ﬁnal six-plus minutes with the assis-
tance of multiple Pitt miscues.

From defensive ineptitude, to a wavering

' offense to a 20-yard punt, Pitt might not have

handed Navy avictory, but it certainly didn’t do
much to prevent one. N avy’s win culminated
in a3o—yard ﬁeld goal by Nick Sloan that split
the uprights as time expired. .

“They beat us. They ﬂat—out just beat us,”
receiver Devin Street said. “Credit to them, but
we beat ourselves too. We can’t keep coming
out here and keep playing two teams at once.
We shot ourselves in the foot.”

Street and the Panthers looked like the
superior team for about 54 minutes Saturday.
In the ﬁrst quarter, Navy’s ﬁrst two drives ac-
cumulated just 7 yards on six plays, and the
Midshipmen did not record a ﬁrst down. '

The next Navy drive resulted in a 58-yard
touchdown pass from Keenan Reynolds to
Marcus Thomas. Thomas reacted to catch
the pass after its intended receiver could
not handle the ball and instead, batted it to
Thomas’ direction.

Beyondaﬂuky play, though, Pitt’s defense
seemed well—prepared for Navy’s unique of-
fense. The only drive Navy sustained inthe ﬁrst
half came in the ﬁnal 1:41 as the Midshipmen
drove to the Pitt 23, but Pitt corner K’Waun
Williams intercepted Reynolds at the 1-yard
line with 36 seconds left in the half. V

BASKETBALL

Exhibition reveals ﬂaws Panthers must correct

J ererny Tepper
Stczﬁ’ Wrz'ter

As history has shown, college basketball

exhibition games mean very little. They’re
a time to work on weaknesses, try different
lineups and plays and match up against
different playing styles.

But if Pitt’s 72-59 victory Friday over
University of California San Diego showed
anything, it’s that head coachjamie Dixon’s
team needs quite a bit of work.

“I can tell you that nobody in that locker
room feels good about how we played to-
night, and that’s good,” Dixon said. “We
are deﬁnitely not going to be overconﬁdent
after this, that’s for sure.”

Ideally, Dixon’s team would have played
like a well-oiled machine, running crisp
offensive sets, ﬁnishing high—percentage
shots, being in the right spots on defense
and dominating the boards like Pitt should
against a much smaller team. .

This was the team’s ﬁrst game, though,
and ﬁrst games often reveal more kinks
than anticipated.

These kinks were apparent from the

very start. The ball handling was sloppy, '

the defense struggled with its switches,
and the offense aimlessly passed around
the perimeter until settling for poor-quality
shots at the end of the shot clock. _

For most of the game,_ it appeared as
though the Panthers would put away their
opponent. But UC San Diego stayed in the
game and fought back from small deﬁcits.

With 3:48 left in the game, the Tritons
even had a chance to take the lead on a
wide-open 3-pointer. The shot missed,

though, and the Panthers went on an 11-0

run to seal the game.

One who didn’t watch the game might
assume that the Panthers won easily just
by looking at the ﬁnal score. The stats,
however, tell the story of Pitt’s struggles.

A quick glance at the ﬁnal stats reveals
a number of statistics that will surely make

Dixon angrily run his hands through his_

hair: 10-for-27 (37 percent) shooting in
the ﬁrst half, 20—for—32 (62.5 percent)

Lamar Patterson scored 16 points in the win. Zach Schaffer | Senior Staff Photographer

free-throw shooting and a mere 33—to—29

rebounding advantage over a team whose

tallest starter is 6-foot-6.

“Obviously we should win and out-
rebound them by more than we did, and
that’s the thing that really stands out to
us,” Dixon said.

Part of the Panthers’ struggles can be
attributed to injuries. Because of junior
center/power forward Derrick Randall’s
injury, senior Lamar Patterson was forced
to start at power forward, while freshman
Mike Young logged signiﬁcant minutes
at center.

Both played out of position, as Young

is a natural power forward and Patterson
is a natural small forward. Dixon acknowl-
edged that this was one of his team’s issues.
“The game just didn’t ﬂow for us, and
we didn’t seem to sustain it,” Dixon said.
”We played guys at different spots, so that
probably didn’t help. The lineup we had out
there we kind of did out of necessity with
Derrick being out. It’s been how we’ve prac-
ticing lately with Mike playing the ﬁve.”
For the most part, the game served as
a learning experience, especially for Pitt’s
freshmen. Out of the 11 players who logged

ceptions totalto 186. And aside from surpass-
ing Grim’s previous milestone, Street also slid
into third place on the all-time receiving yards
list, passing Grim and Larry Fitzgerald. Street

-has now racked up 2,692 career receiving

_ yards behind only Dietrichjells (3,003) and

Antonio Bryant (3,061). _

Street’s accomplishment went unknown
to Savage, and Street did not spend too much
time talking about it himself, saying it was
marred by the last—second loss.

' “It’s bittersweet,” said Street. “We got to
put the puzzle pieces together. They’re scat-
tered right now.” ‘

Penalized Panthers 4

Entering the contest, Navy was the least-

penalized team in college football, averaging
just three per game. Those numbers didn’t lie
Saturday, either.

The Midshipmen were penalized four
times for 27 yards compared to Pitt’s 7-for-45.
Additionally, Navy is now second in the nation
in penalty yards per game with just 29. Head
coach Paul Chryst tipped his cap to Navy’s
discipline while pointing to free yardage as
a prime reason why Pitt is 4-3 and not 5-2.

“We "hurt ourselves with penalties early
in the second half. So all of a sudden, We’re
backed up. We’re still third-and-10 or ﬁrst-
and-20 or second-and—20,” said Chryst. “Their
ﬁeld position changed a little bit. We didn’t

do a good enough job with changing ﬁeld A

position.” .
V T_o reiterate what Chrysthad said, Street
and Savage repeatedly used the same idiom.

“We shot ourselves in the foot,” they both
said. .

Chryst speculated that Navy also schemed
well. He said the team made some necessary
adjustments in the locker room during half-
time to keep Pitt’s offense from pounding the
football. '

“I thought early, we did a good job at rLm-

 ning the ball consistently. They made some

adjustments and made some plays, so we
couldn’t just run atwill. And that’s the game,”
Chryst said. ‘

As for Pitt’s defense, Chryst said that be-
cause the Midshipmen rarely touched the ball
in the ﬁrst half, he wasn’t able to judge what
they wereaiming to accomplish until it was
too late. Alter all, Pitt had dominated the time
of possession in the ﬁrst half, 22:18 to 7:42.

“We didn’t really know what their attack
was. We didn’t see enough plays, whether they
weren’t getting to [their offense] or what,”

_ Chryst said.

Street walked out of me locker roomafter
Saturday’s loss clutching a marked-up game
ball. He tried his best to conceal it as he took
blame for Pitt’s second-half collapse, saying

L that “little things” keep the Panthers from

being great.

= “I don’t think we are an average team. I
thinkwe are a good team who has the potential
to be a great team, but in order for us to be a

- great team, we have to do the little things and

not shoot ourselves in the foot,’.’ Street said.

BASKETBALL

minutes for the Panthers, four were fresh-
men. Of those four, Young was the only one
who impacted the game positively, ﬁnishing
with 11 points while looking quite comfort-
able bodying his opposition in the post.

Meanwhile, Young’s backup, Jamel Ar-
tis, struggled on both ends of the court,
guardjosh Newkirk played tentatively, and
redshirt freshman guard Chris Jones just
looked completely out of sorts.

Despite the growing pains of Pitt’s fresh-
men, Patterson was impressed with their
efforts, especially those of Young.

“Mike, he did a great job today, espe-
cially at the end of the game,” Patterson
said. “The other two, they did good today,

but like every other freshman they had
minor mistakes that they can grow from.
They’ll be good, they’re in good hands, so
they’ll learn.”

'Pitt’s two most tenured players — se-
niors Patterson and forward Talib Zanna -—
performed steadily throughout the game.
Zanna scored 17 points and grabbed 11 re-
bounds, while Patterson scored 16 points.

As a player who knows his coach’s sys-
tem inside and out, Patterson was conﬁ-
dent that his team’s issues are minor and
correctable.

“If we get the defense down pat, they
don’t get those threes, and the scoring mar-
gin’s a lot bigger,” Patterson said. “Just little
stuff, that’s all we’ve got to work on. I think
everything else is pretty ﬁne. Those are
deﬁnitely things that are ﬁxable, and We’re
deﬁnitely going to be right at it.” I
