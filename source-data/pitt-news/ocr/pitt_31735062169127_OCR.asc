UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Kurtzman   Appointed State

Debates

Out — of - State Ratio,
Commuter Problems

by DAN BOOKER

“I value highly a cosmopolitan atmosphere . . . but hav-

ing 30 per cent out-of-state students is not the only cri-

teria,” said Chancellor Wesley Posvar in a WPGH Round-
table with student leaders recorded Tuesday.

Not only must we have out-of-state students, but they

must come from a varietyof states, continued Posvar. He

added, “We also must mix students of different racial and

family backgrounds.”

These comments were a reaction to a remark of Stu-
dent Government President Ken Frederick that he was “impressed
with the quality of in-st-ate students, but worried about the low
number of out-of-state students in the entering freshman class.”

Posva-r explained that much of the problem arose from a lack
of dormitory space and difficulty in getting qualiﬁed ou-t-of-state

students to apply. He remarked that the University needs to be

more “vigorous” in get-ting such students to apply. ~

Jim Smythe, general manager
of WPGH radio, commented that
besides limited dorm space, the
very location of the University
dictates that there will always
be a high proportion of com-
muting students. He wondered,

however, whether a supposed

“commitment to the city (Pitts-
burgh)" might make this pro-
portion too high.

The Chancellor answered,‘

“There will always be a concen-
tration of, Pittsburgh students,
but we -"won't accept lower abil-
ity students ,just because they
live in the city.”

In planning’ for physical ex-
pansion, mentioned Chancellor
Emeritus David Kurtzman, the
University keeps the city in
mind “because we -are part of
the city.” Kurtzman said -that

- one reason the University is de- y
veloping a "Master Plan for

growth is “to let the community

know where we are going."
Here, SG President Frederick

charged,» “Perhaps the city isn't

cooperating with us.” He point-~.

ed out that commuting students
very often have trouble With bus
transportation. Students coming

from many-parts of the Greater

Pittsburgh area very often can-
not come directly into Oakland,
and students just outside walk-
ing distance have to pay the
same fare as riders going down-
town, Frederick.

Linda Goldstein, "editor of -the
Pitt News, supported Frederick.
She warned that the University

‘needs to help ease the student

"parking problems and work
more closely with the Port Au-
thority Transit (PAT), or .stu-

: dent activities will suffer.

Posvar noted that the prob-
lem with bus transportation is
one that needs studying. “I think
this would be a good area of
investigation for Student Gov-
ernment,” he said. If the study
showed a real problem and con-
crete suggestions came ' of it,
Posvar promised he «would sup-
port suggestions to PAT fully.

The Roundtable will be broad-

Besides the number of out-of-

state students and commuting-

problems, the discussion hit
three other topics.

informed at a press confer-
ence Wednesday afternoon
in the 'Chancellor’s Office.
Dr. Kurtzman, who served
as Chancellor of the University
until Dr. Wesley W. Posvar as-
sumed the post June 1, will be-
gin his new position «Sept. 1.

Associated with Pittsburgh Sports

University students who -walk
down Forbes St. from now on
will miss one -of the most color-
ful -news-store owners that Oak-
land has ever seen. Gus Miller,
owner of "Miller’s Wonder
Store,” d-ied Sunday in Presby-
terian-University Hospital.

“Wonder” was a perfect ad-

jective to describe not only 
ler’s store, but Miller him-self.

Miller began as a newspaper
“sa.lesman”.in 1892. To boost his
sales, he would jump on to a
streetcar and sell the papers to
the passengers. Miller was also
chief usher at the Pirate games
from 1901 to 1947.»S‘everal years
ago, he threw out the ﬁrst -ball
of the season. Because of his
connections with the sports
world, many sports celebrities
visited his store.

Student shoplifters may be a

bit of a problem to other store
owners in the Oakland district,
but they weren't to “Gus” Miller.
Miller devised his own harmless
yet humorous method of dis-
couraging them. He would place
a few trick cigars on his shelves
as decoys, which would explode
like ﬁrecrackers if anyone tried
to steal them. .

Miller, 86, operated his store

at the corner of ‘Forbes and At- V

wood Sts. for over 60 years.

Board of Trustees. It read: “We

are delighted and proud to learn . I‘ it

of Chancellor Emeritus Kurtz-
man's appointment as Superin-

tendent of Public Instruction of _
Pennsylvania. At the same time, "

we are deeply sorry that we
shall lose the beneﬁt of his daily
counsel and competence.” I

The statement pointed out
that Dr, Kurtzman “is one of
the able-st public servants in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

His experience in educatibn, gov- ,

ermnent and public ﬁnance were
invaluable to the University of
Pittsburgh in the last two years.
His contributions to this insti-

ptution were of historic propor-

tions.”

When asked to comment on
how he felt leaving the Univer-
sity, the Chancellor Emeritus
emphasized, “This has been the
most interesting two years of
myentire life. I have made my
contribution to the University
and I hope we got the University

on the ﬁnancial track, for I «

wouldn’t leave if I thought I
was leaving the University in
the middle of its most important
problems.” — '

Dr. Kurtzman stated that “from
a personal viewpoint, I just love
this University. I've made so
many friends that it’s really dif-
ﬁcult to tear myself away from
such friendships.” ‘

New Innovation

Medical School toStart New Curriculum

The School ’ of Medicine
this fall will introduce a new
curriculum aimed at making
the medical course more

. like other types of graduate _

study and deviating from
the philosophy that all phy-
sicians need exactly the
same basic educational pro-
gram. '

Essentially, the new curricu-
lum will give the medical stu-
dent more time for independent
study and greater freedom to
put together an educational pro-
gram that ﬁts his individual
background, interests and needs.
The entire -fourth year of medi-
cal school, in fact, will be de-
voted to elective -study, and ap-
proximately half the hours of
the week during the first two
years will be unscheduled‘ and
thus available for the student's
own self-directed learning.

Under the present curriculum,

students have a full schedule of ,

required courses d-uring all but

eight weeks of the four-year
‘ medical program. Also, the pre-

sent fourth year schedule large-
ly -repeats a third year series of
clinical experiences that give the
student exposure to various
areas of medicine. ‘

While a number of American
medical schools in recent years
‘have_undertaken similar major
departures from traditional. U.S.

order to in- '

   

still more ﬂexibility in their cur-
ricula, the greatest break with
the past in the new program at
the University—and the one that
made possible all of the other
innovations—is a change in the
philosophy, objective and nun»
ber of laboratory courses.

At present, the laboratory is

used to illustrate facts present-_

ed to the medical student in
lectures and textbooks. Under
the new curriculum, the labora-
tory will be used to give the stu-
dent‘ an intensive experience in
experimental biology designed
to teach him the attitude and
method of critical inquiry in
science so that he may continue
his self-education throughout his
medical career.

As a result, -the -total required
lalboratory time will be more
concentrated, releasing several
hundred instructional hours for
independent -study. . _ '

Announcement of the changes,"
which were approved recently
by the medical school faculty,

was made by Dr. Francis S. ‘

Cheever, dean of the School of
Medicine and vice chancellor for
the health professions.‘

“The new curriculum,’’‘ Dr.
Cheever said, “is an attempt to

provide students the opportunity .
‘to select different pathways in

their basic medical education. It
recognizes -that -students coming

to medical school are not" horne-

geneousfirl their academic -back-_

    

does ‘not turn out a completely
standardized product. It also rec-
ognizes the great change and

improvement in pre-professional

education today and the -great
accummulation of medical know-
ledge with which the modern
physician has to deal, "We hope
to give students a more inten-
sive understanding 'of speciﬁc
areas of medicine, while permit-
ting -them to become more broad-
ly educated men, ﬁtted for life-
long -self-education in the rapid-
ly changing health sciences.”
The new curriculum will not
result in ‘any reduction in the
length -of the medical course at
Pitt. In fact, the academic year
is being lengthened by two
weeks for each of the ﬁrst two
years of medical 'school—from
36 weeks to 38 weeks. And the

four-year course will be follow- ‘

ed -by the usual periods of in-
ternship and residency.

But with the time added to the
school year and save through
the restructuring of the labora-
tory, students will -have more op-
porttmity for developing their

-special interests in medicine "in

depth. In addition, the new cur-
riculum provides better integra-
tion of the “pre-clinical” or lab-
oratory-classroom phase of med-
ical education with the “clinical”
or hospital-patient care phase.
The curriculum revision is an

. outgrowth. of faculty study and

Curriculum. Committee which co-
ordinated .the work is Dr. Ken-

neth Rogers, who is chairman’
of the Department of Preventive

Medicine at the School.

In explaining the key change A

in «the -laboratory portion of the
medical curriculum, Dr. Rogers
said: '

“Tlhe ever-increasing body of
biological knowledge over the
years has made it clearly impos-
sible -to illustrate through labor-
atory exercises more than a
fraction of the total -knowledge
in '9. -ﬁeld, despite the fact that
hundreds of curriculum -hours
have been devoted to this pur-
pose. Our faculty became in-
creasingly aware that the tradi-

tional- objective of laboratory .‘

teadhing was not being and
could not be achieved. More 
portantly, the faculty question-
ed whether it was -still appropri-
ate and- desirable. Their- ‘conclu-
sion was that a new objective
should be identiﬁed.”

The Pitt Medical School's De- C

partment of Physiology ‘has pio-
neered in the development of

this new kind of laboratory, ‘
teaching and has demonstrated -
its effectiveness. In such a lab-..

oratory, ..,the ‘student does not

  Farewell

When The Pitt News published its recent two-page tribute ‘to our
Chancellor Emeritus David H. Kurtzman, we were unaware that he
would be leaving the University so soon to tackle another challenging
position. But although his leaving is a great loss to the University, we
cannot really be too surprised: men of Dr. Kurtzman’s calibre are hard
to find. It was really just a matter of time until he was offered the
type of assignment that appealed to him. _

Unfortunately for the University but fortunately for the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, our Chancellor Emeritus was asked to serve as
Superintendent of Public Instruction of Pennsylvania, a position certain-
ly worthy of his many talents. Our happiness at this recognition is
dampered a bit, however, by our sadness at seeing him leave the Uni-
versity. , . , . «
Dr. Kurtzman remarked that his two years here “have been the
most interesting two years of my entire life.” In his relatively brief ten-
ure at the University, he made a contribution that few could achieve in
a lifetime. His success was not only his guiding our institution to its
current state-related status and tackling the massive problem of the

I huge financial debt’ ($19.5 million) facing the University when he first

became associated with our school as Vice-Chancellor for Finance.

Dr. Kurtzman’s real contribution must be regarded as_his ability
to take that walk out of the Chancellor's impressive office and meet
faculty members and students, in addition to administrators, at every
opportunity afforded him. He delighted in participating in student events
and engaging in discussions with the student leaders serving on the

Chancellor's Student Affairs Advisory Committee. To him, direct con-
tact with students was a vital part of his job. His humility allowed us
to forget about his overwhelming accomplishments and regard him as
a friendly, interested person completely devoid of formidability.

Dr. Kurtzman willingly discussed issues of student concern, ome of
the mostimportant of which was the question of the policy of the Uni-
versity Book Center. He stated to The Pitt News that he would support
a student discount, even if it could only be a five per cent discount for
students, faculty, and staff. Dr. Kurtzman also established the current
Committee on the Book Center Policy to review the situation, choosing
for participants three students, three faculty members, and three ad-
ministrators.

We can only hope that our Chancellor Emeritus’ efforts on such
questions as the Book Center policy and a_ possible student discount will

be effectively carried out. But we must be thankful that his term at the I"

University allowed him to assure the success of so many projects he
undertook and, of course, the most important one: putting the University
on the road for attaining even greater accomplishments than have been
achieved in the past. Our current encouraging outlook would have been
impossible without Dr. Kurtzman’s expert guidance.

We can only wish Chancellor Emeritus David H. Kurtzman the
very best in his new position, confident that he, of all people, knows just
how to achieve this. And though we are reluctant to see him leave the
University, we thank him sincerely for doing so much for us during his
tenure here. His was indeed a rare contribution.

Slum Housing

Subhuman Conditions

" “THE CONDITIONS are

‘not just deplorable, they’re

subhuman,” stated WIIC-TV
newsman Wes Sergeantson
in a recent documentary on
housing conditions in the
Manchester district of Pitts-
burgh’. _ .
Sergeantson’s ,-report was
made in conjunction with a
new attack on the housing
situation in Manchester spon-
sored by the Northside Com-

munity Action Program

(CAP). For years Manchest-
er residents have been forced
to live in slum conditions

I I dueto proﬁteering by land-
lords and inactivity by city_

and county agencies charged
with maintenance of housing
codes. Now, in one motion,
the Northside CAP plans to
remedy the subhuman condi-
tions by the end of the sum-
mer.

‘ Manchester, located on

-Pittsburghfs Northside, is a

Negro ghetto composed of
100 year old dwellings orig-
inally built to house immi-
grant workers for Pitts-
burgh’s iron foundries. ‘Due
to the displacing effects of

....Urban Renewal in other

parts of the city, Manchester
has become a dead-end street,
a place to go when all other
hopes for housing have been
buried by the bulldozer.
NATURALLY, ALONG
with the inﬂux of people into
Manchester, came those

whose goal was proﬁt. Since‘

there were not enough homes
to house the increased popu-
lations, these profiteers

would buy up a structure,
subdivide rooms with ply-
wood partitions, and then
charge rents of $75-110 per
month for two rooms made
into four. Compounding the
high rents was the fact that
the landlords guilty of these
practices refused to make
structural repairs necessary
to the comfort andsafety of
the occupants.

One ‘of the largest proper-
ty owners on the Northside

’ is M. G. Mosites, head of a

contracting ﬁrm and the ﬁrst
target of CAP's ﬁght for
better housing. The CAP of-
ﬁce _on North Avenue had re-
ceived many complaints

0‘ against _Mosites and decided

from the nature of the com-
plaints to ask the landlord
for a cut in rents, a general
extermination of his proper-
ties, the repair of all defects
in his properties, and the
stopping. of intimidation
against tenants.

‘At a May meeting with

' Mosites’ tenants, CAP staf-

fers, and ‘interested neigh-
bors, the landlord appeared
and, with loud protestations,
signed an agreement with
the group embodying a 15
per cent cut in rent along
with the other demands. Re-

. pairs and extermination have

since been started and will
be continuous throughout
the summer. ”

HOWEVER, IN conduct-
ing research on propery con-
ditions for its confrontation
with Mosites, the CAP work-

ers realized that the housing
issue in Manchester was not
solely the result of the land-
lords, but also was due to
apathy by the Health De-
partment, the Pittsburgh
Housing Authority, and the
Urban Renewal Authority..
After demanding inspec-
tion by the Health Depart-
ment of Mosites properties,
CAP found that the landlord
owned previously condemned

properties with people living_

in them, a ‘clear violation of
the law. Yet the Health De-
partment itself, which con-
demns buildings, had not act-
ed to prosecute.

Public Housing contributes
to the situation by not plan-
ning enough low income
housing. The waiting list for
a project apartment is over
a year for an average family
Urban Renewal, on the other
hand, acts more like Negro
Removal and forces over-
crowding of already packed
districts by tearing down
homes to build factories and
parking lots.

CURRENTLY CAP is
working on "a number of
projects in conjunction with
its housing ﬁght. In the past
week it has gone to battle
with realtor Edward Talen-
feld, who evicted an epilep-
tic widow and her 11 chil-
dren because she was paying
her rent into a specal es-
crow account until repairs
were made. CAP moved the
woman back in and forced

the city to promise that she

would not have to leave until
she had found a place to live.
CAP is now hiring neighbor-
hood teenagers to help or-
ganize the Manchester resi-
dents and inform them of
their legal rights to decent
homes. By involving the peo-
ple themselves, CAP hopes
that its goal of better hous-
ing will be a -reality without
the necessity for riots or vio-
lence. But if this is to be the
case then Pittsburgh must
wake upto the situation of
housing in Manchester. The
day of the "slumlord is past;
he must no longer be per-
mitted. to deal in misery

. whilethe city shuts its eyes.

   

 

In Allocations

Vested Interests

. by Dan Booker

Most of a long, important job was finished last Sat-
urday when the Student -Government Senate approved 39
of 45 recommendations of the Allocations Committee.
Nearly $116,000 was given to student groups. Only six
requests must be reconsidered by the Committee. But at
least half of these demonstrate a significant flaw in the
present procedures for review of the Committee's recom-
mendations. «

This flaw may be discovered by examination of the
reasons for the return of the six requests. One request, of

the Pitt Photo Club, was returned because of lack of infor- '

mation. Another, by the Army ROTC Cadet Brigade, was
rejected pending review of the organization by the Recog-
nitions Committee. Associated Women Students request,
the largest of those returned, caused the Senate to question,
whether buying lanterns and training senior assistants was
a student or administrative function.

Such concrete reasons for review of Committee recom-
mendations are not present in the remaining three requsts.
They were returned primarily because what was a value
judgment by the Committee was not accepted by the Sen-
ate. Such value judgments, considering the limited amount
of funds and the overwhelming demand for monies, are

unavoidable. _Yet, in making them, all information on a .
group’s program and its place in the total programming‘

must be considered. It is only in the Committee that this
total view o-f data is available. _

Sitting in the Senate were the Business Manager of
the Pitt Capsule, the President of the Engineering Student
Cabinet, and the acting Treasurer of Druids. The requests
of these three groups are the remaining ones returned to
the Committee. Partly by the presence of these Senators

‘and their stout defense of allocation requests they them-

selves submitted, the Committee's value judgment was
rejected. .

These three groups were given an opportunity not
,g'iveIn to Ideas and Figures, the Owl, Students for Peace,
Phi Eta Sigma, the University of Pittsburgh Theater, or
any other of a number of groups whose allocation request
was cut considerably. A Senator’s vested interest entered
the scene'when the situation called for dispassionate re-
view of a program's place in the panorama of a year’s stu-
dent activities.

The necessity for understanding the panorama and 
assessing each program’s place in it, combined with the ’

desire to keep the decision making on fund allocations on
an objective plane, is a basic. reason for the existence of
the Committee. If it occurs that a Committee member has

§\

a special interest in a particular group, rules dictate that »

he sit out of the Committee when that group’s request is
being reviewed.

This rule is needed when the Senate reviews Commit-
tee recommendations; A senator with a vested interest
gives his group an unfair voice in thefinal decision. Giv-
ing this voice, backed by avote, to all groups would de-
feat the goal of dispassion and the careful consideration
of the total picture.

In the Fall, the Committee will present recommenda-
tions on the requests turned back to it. Itmay or may not
make different recommendations. However, these recom-
mendations will not be reviewed on a par with other stu-
dent groups as long as the Senators representing these

favored organizations remain seated when their respective 3 ~

requests /are considered’.

Grgurich has been seeking

Where the really encouraging

namely recruiting. Soon, for the
ﬁrst time in years, these teams
may be armied with enough real-
ly good performers to compete
on an equal basis with their op-

due to an increased number of

full or partial aid. His top pros-

Jerry Richey, hurdler Bill
Downes, and javelin thrower
Bob Kouvalo.

In all, Banner has performers

Ohio, New Jersey, and two great

BEN POPE

Abrams believes that he can
ﬁeld a top team’ with four or
ﬁve. -full scholarships a year.
This year he has four; starting
‘next year he will have ﬁve.
Adams, who is considered a
great recruiter, has al-ready sign-
ed two state champions. In ad-
diton, he will -have the services
of Ralph Cindrich -and Joe Spic-
ko, football signees who are top

A wrestlers.

Likewise, gymnastics coaxch
Warren N ei-ger, soccer’s Leo Be-
mis, Lewis, -- Pope, Perry -and
other coaches are bound to bene-
ﬁt from the program also. That
is, if they are able to recruit.
Carver does not expect each
coach to producea world~beater.
He does expect their teams to
be respectable. And that, in
many cases, would be a great
improvement.

L ,National Implications

Out-of—State Tuition Rapped

(Editor-’s Note — The following
article is reprinted from the
Michigan Daily at the University
of Michigan.)-
by PAT O’DONOHUE

A 24-year-old law student at
the University of Iowa is now
challenging the right of state
schools to charge the higher tui-
tion. While his suit is’ Qlirected

. at the Iowa Board of Regents,
» which governs the University of

Iowa, Iowa State University and
State College of Iowa, the na-
tional implications of the suit
are obvious.

The student is Stephen Johns
of Wilmette, IH. An an out-of-

' state student he is paying $970

a year to attend the Iowa law
school, while resident law stu-
dentspay $380.

John contends that Iowa’s
specifying higher

out-of-state students in Iowa are
unconstitutional in that they de-
-prive these students of their
rights under the equal-protec-

_tion caluse‘of the U.S. Constitu-

tion. _

_ Johns is asking the court for
a permanent injunction prohibit-
ing the Iowa Board of Regents
from enforcing its higher tui-

tion regulations against citizens
of other states. A second action
would seek to recover nonresi-
dent tuition already paid by stu-
dents at the three colleges gov-

‘erned by the board. The suit
will be ‘heard by a three-judge
panel in Des Moines in late sum-
mer or early fall.

Another student at the Iowa
law school last year was success-
ful in having himself reclassi-
ﬁed as an Iowa resident for tui-
tion purposes. That was an in-
dividual case, -however, and the
new suit chalenges all nonresi-
dent tuition at the institutions
controlled ‘by the Iowa Board
of Regents. .

Charles Clarke, one of Johns’
lawyers, from Detroit, claims
that the current practice among
states of charging nonresidents
a much higher rate of tuition
than that charged residents
makes an “interstate education
primarily the prerrogative of the
rich.” Thus “persons of modest
means must make tremendous
sacriﬁces to receive such an edu-
cation,” he continued.

Clarke reportedly believes the
states have been given too much
freedom of action in this area-
and that they ﬁnd the opportun-
ity to charge “outlanders” all
that the traffic will bear “too ir-
resistible to forego.” _

“Naturally,” he said, most
states retaliate at least as a mat-
ter of self defense, if not to
avoid being cast in the role of
generous fools.” He said those
state university that “exert a
top draw” for out-of-state stu-
dents have a very proﬁtable
stake in the continuation of the
“discriminatory tuition practice
that now exist.”

Johns and his lawyer have in-
troduced a plan under which
the court could -order the states
to establish reciprocity agree-
ments in educating each other’s
students into the suit. .

Under the plan, each state
would work out with all other
states a procedure under which
a certain number of students
would be “exchanged” each year.
These students would pay resi-
dent tuition.

:(Continued .from Page 1)
a special committee was review-
ing book center policies but that
a ten per cent discount is prob-

ably more than the University
can afford to give. Posvar has
“no strong feeling opinions one
way or the other” and is wait-
ing .for the Com-mittee’s report.

> The Trimester Calendar. Dr.
Kurtzman said that a poor re-

sponse during the spring session

and the relatively good response
for the summer session may
mean that two semesters with a
strong summer session would
be best. Dr. Posvar asked the
students whether a trimester

system in any form is prefer-
able to the traditional calendar
of two semesters.

Miss Goldstein said the pre-
sent calendar is very accommo-
dating for students. Frederick
said a possible calendar might
have each trimester start and
end a month later than at pre-
sent,

  

cation will be submitted July 7.

uate in August should apply im-
