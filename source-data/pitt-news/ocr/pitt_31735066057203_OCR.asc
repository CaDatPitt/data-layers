BAS, CR3 clash
over proposed
cultural center

By Beth Kovaly

Asst. News Editor

BiGALA sponsors Networking
on its way to Washington, D.C.

College Republicans say that the Black
Action Society resorted to “scare tactics” on
former CR President Kevin Docherty while
promoting a Black Cultural Center on cam-
pus.

Docherty said that Tuesday’s meeting with
BAS Chair Keith Davis ended with Docherty
feeling personally threatened.

Docherty had questioned the need for a
Black Cultural Center on campus after the
Student Government Board resolved Monday
night to support BAS in its project. Davis and

, BAS Deputy Chair Michael Barge arranged to
meet with Docherty and newly elected CR
President Eric Lurie.’

The meeting raised questions such as how
the Center would be funded, where it would
be located and whether it would benefit all
students. ‘ _

It left both BAS and CR members with the
feeling that nothing was accomplished.

“I’m very concerned with the tactics Keith
Davis is using to suppress discussion about a
Black‘Cultural Center,” Lurie said. “By sup-
pressing discussion he is going to cause a
racial war on campus and College
Republicans will have nothing to do with .
this.”

Davis, CR members and SGB member Tom
Grassia had agreed to meet formally
Wednesday. evening face to face, but Davis
decided not to attend. . ,

‘‘BAS decided that it is not in our best
interest to respond publicly,” Davis said. “I
see it as just going around in a circle. If they
want to meet informally, I am willing. But
nothing is going to get accomplished in the
press.”

Davis did respond to accusations that he
used “scare tactics” on Docherty.

“I don’t know what he is talking about,” he
said. “I tried to shed some understanding on
an issue. Iconfronted them about informa-
tion [about the proposed Center] they had
put in Tbe Pitt News and In Pittsburgh,
which was totally unfactual.”

In a letter Davis sent to Grassia on
Wednesday, he advised the board member to
“stop supporting the College Republicans”

Gone are the days when
successful collegqograduates
enjoyed the sound"o'f three or
four employers beating down
their doors to offer them jobs.
Now college graduates are
pounding down the doors of
Pitt’s graduate schools in
search of continuing their
education and making them-
selves more marketable.

According to Robert
Perkoski, director of The
University of ,Pittsburgh
Placement Office, today’s
newly streamlined companies

are not looking for as many
people because of the reces-
sion.

“Companies have learnegl to
produce the same amount
with less,” Perkoski said.
“Now that they have learned,
it would be a waste of money
to hire on more people when
[the economy] begins to pick
up.”

“There is no doubt that
more and more students are
going to graduate school,”
Perkoski said. “There are
fewer companies recruiting
on campus so students have
to make themselves as mar-
ketable as possible when they

come. What companies like is
a lot of experience in the
work place and graduate
degrees.”

What are Pitt’s graduate
schools offeringtheir stu-
dents that makes them attrac-
tive to undergraduates in
search of graduate degrees?

According to Dean Davis
Bobrow of the Graduate
School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA),
the school is ‘offering one of
the best educations compared
to other schools with similar
curriculums.

“GSPIA is well into a way of
renaissance,” he said. “It’s

good and getting better. It’s
the non-teaching aspects as
well as the teaching that
make an impact on a
prospective student.
Applicationsare up enor-
mously.”

Among the opportunities
offered by GSPIA are alumni-
sponsored job fairs held
annually in Washington, D.C.,
and internships or other
experience. ‘

According to Bobrow, the
future looks good for GSPIA
graduates in part because of
Clinton’s promotion of work

in the public sector.

THE PI’IT NEWS, Thursda , A ril 22, 1993

End of year brings a mix of emotions

s I have written in earlier
articles, the end of an acad-
emic year brings with it mixed
feelings of accomplishment and
loss. While it’s a happy time of
year, it is also a time for saying
goodbye to people and things
familiar.

This can be problematic for
some students. It is a particularly
poignant time for seniors, but
other students may also feel a lit-
tle emotionally unsettled.

These feelings of uneasiness
are normal and predictable. The
end of a school‘ year is a time of
transition, and such times tend to

elicit complex emotions in all of

us.

It is a time of both anticipation
and loss. There is a loss of rou-
tine, old friends and support net-
works. For seniors, there is the
loss of a college-student identity
that has provided a certain feel-
ing of stability for the last few

years. ,

Transitional periods may also
touch off hidden emotions. Every
step of our growth process, from
infancy to the present, has

counter a new transitional peri-
od, we need to deal with the
anxiety that may arise from these
old memories.

The uneasiness or mild feeling.

Some of these transitions may

to acknowledge our present loss-
es and do a little thinking about
past losses as well.

Such activity helps» us to make
sense of at least some of our con-
fused feelings at this time of year.

The good news in all of this is
that the losses we have experi-

enced in the past and may be
experiencing now are a neces-
sary part of continued growth. As
Judith Viorst states in her book
Necessary Losses, “The road to
human development is paved
with renunciation.”

We grow throughout our lives
by giving up some of our deep-
est attachments. In confronting
these losses we present ourselves
with opportunities for new
growth.

Viorst also tells us that we can-
not love deeply without becom-
ing vulnerable to loss, and “we
cannot become separate people,
responsible people, connected
people, without some losing and
letting go.”

So take the‘ time you need to
mourn your losses. Then draw
strength from what has gone
before and use it to help you
make the most of the opportuni-
ties that lie ahead.

Attention all current and prospective
photographers: There will he a meeting at 5:00 today
at 429 William Pitt Union. All interested may attend.

Students suffer without
Study Abroad dollars

By Rachael Devine
Sta_[7‘Writer

David Paroline wanted to have a
competitive edge when he went to
Washington, DC, with his Italian
degree from Pitt, but unlike a lot of
his competition he could not study
abroad

Paroline wants to be a translator,
but ornnot participate in PitI’s Study
Abroad program due to a lack of
scholarship funding. With 10,050
College of Arts and Science students
at Pitt and S10,(X)0 available for Study
Abroad sdiolarships —— that amounts
to 99 Cents per student.

“Going through the classes at Pitt
just isn't enough,” Paroline  “You
don’t get to use the language."

In November 1991, it looked like
Paroline and other students would
be able to go abroad A referendum
was proposed by Student
Government Board President Brent
Saunders, Pitt Study Abroad Director
Angie Yucas and CAS Dean Mary
Briscoe, that would add $1 to student
tuition.

That dollar would go for Study
Abroad scholarships. If students
voted in favor of the referendum
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor said
Pitt would match the money.

The referendum passed with 72
percent of the 1.500 students voting
in favor.

‘We were ecstatic at the thought of
having a scholarship fund close to
$52,000,  Yucas 

In the past, financing to study
abroad was limited to a $10,000 

arship funding for the 1992-93 acad-
emic year, Briscoe told the Study
Abroad Office to give the entire
$10,000 away during the summer
months.

“We were told, through the chan-
cellors office, that the money would
be in place,” Briscoe said.

The scholarship money never

came. But the Study Abroad Office
received many applications for the
fall Study Abroad program. To deal
with the inﬂux of applications, The
University Center for International
Studies (UCIS) gave an extra $5,000
to the Study Abroad Office. The
money given by UCIS was for the
entire year.

According to Yucas, only 2 per-
cent of the student body studies
abroad. The national average is 4
percent.

A task force funded by the federal
government and consisting of the
Association of International
Educators, Council on International
Educational Exchange and the
Institution of International Education
recommended that 10 percent of all
students should study abroad.
Syracuse University and University of
Virginia both send 15 percent of their
student body abroad and Penn State
sends 7 percent

The chancellor’s office said
O’Connor held a senior staff meeting
April 15 to find an answer on the
issue of Study Abroad Scholarship
funds. His office refused comment
on that meetings results.

Yucas said that while a proposal is
being drafted in principle. students
are losing time.

“Our students are missing out and
iue unable to compete with students
coming from study abroad back-
grounds," Yucas said

Attorney Edgar Snyder:~

A fresh ta/ee on #99 law profession

By Victor Wallace
Staff Writer

He has one of the most recognizable index
fingers in Western Pennsylvania.

Edgar Snyder is the balding, bearded,
broadcasting barrister pointing that finger.
His promise is that there will be “no fee
unless we get money for you.”

This Pitt Law School alumnus‘ ubiquitous
ads pop up among daytime reruns or
between‘ the late-night infomercials. With
this method, Snyder considers himself an
innovator in self-prornotion.

“It used to be that the only way lawyers
could get legal business was by word of
mouth,” Snyder said.

His mouth is transmitted into millions of
homes daily. While this method has made
him a lot of money, he says Pitt and most
other law schools do little or nothing at all to
teach lawyers how to market themselves.

“Law schools still don’t train students to
what business means,” Snyder said. “They
don’t send them out understanding that they
can open their own business. It is very hard
to get a job.”

Snyder’s road to becoming one of the most
well—known lawyers in Pittsburgh took him
through strange legal briefs.

Growing up in Squirrel Hill. his parents
asked him if he was going to become a cloc-
tor or a lawyer. After his first  in chem-

istry he chose the more rhetorical route law’

had to offer.

He graduated from Pitt’s School of Law in
1966. Immediately afterwards. he opened his
own office in Duquesne, Pa. The office was

outside a steel mill and business picked up
almost immediately. Most of his clients were
steel workers leaving their shifts and seeing
his office open.

During this time he was a lawyer’s version
of the jack of all trades. Most of his cases
involved criminal law with only a few per-
sonal injury cases, which is now his forte.

At the same time. Snyder was a trial lawyer
for the public defenders office. He says all
he did those years was go to court every
day. That is how I learned to try cases.

"During the ‘70s, I represented some of the
highest profile homicide cases in Allegheny
County,” he boasts.

In his stint in the public defenders office,
he had one of his strangest cases.

Out of fear of the verdict, Snyder’s client
threatened to commit suicide by climbing to
the top of the Allegheny County jail and to
jump. As the other inmates yelled “jump.“
Snyder was asked by the warden to climb up
to the roof and ask him to come down.

“Fortunately, he did come down. I always
felt that that was well beyond my scope of
employment,” he said.

A 1978 ruling by the Supreme Court gave
lawyers the right to advertise. The case com-
pletely changed the way lawyers were able
to attract business and also changed
Snyder’s legal course forever.

Sandy, his wife, owned a marketing firm.
In 1982. she suggested the thought of adver-
tising almost on a whim. It was that whim
that brought his first ad. which appeared in
'/‘be Pittsbzutgb Press.

Shortly after that ad. they learned his first

If you can't sell your  
books, donate them

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

Instead of throwing away the books that cannot be
bought back, students can donate textbooks and novels
to the “Bridge of Knowledge.”

“The Bridge of Knowledge” program, sponsored by
the University Book Center and Student Government
Board, will take all of the old editions and out-of-
prints collected and send them to developing coun-
tries.

SGB member Tony Moody said that students who
cannot sell their books back after finals week now have
three options —— “keep them, throw them away or
donate them to people who can use them.” i

The program, which is under the National Association
of College Stores (NACS), will have several drop-off
sites around campus until April 30.

Students can bring their books to the William Pitt
Union, Lothrop Hall, Sutherland Hall, The Book Center
and Schenley Quad.

The books collected could be sent to Asia’s poverty-
stricken. NACS donated 150,000 books to Asia in 1991.
The leaders of a Chinese delegation visited the Bridge
of Asia Foundation and reconfirmed the need for

‘ 500,000 to 600,000 books.

“We ISGBI feel it’s an important community service,”

he said.

Pittsburgher wins literature prize

By Maral Halajian
For The Pitt News

This year’s winner of Drue
Heinz Literature Prize is a
native Pittsburgher who
presently teaches creative
writing at Cornell University.

Stewart O’nan, who grew
up in Breezewood, was cho-
sen out of a field. of 526
published writers to receive
the literature prize for his
book In The Walled City.
O’nan, the 13th winner of
the annual prize, will
receive a $10,000 cash
award and his book will be
published by the University
Of Pittsburgh Press in
September.

In Th_e Walled City is a
collection of short fiction
about people making diffi-
cult choices often dealing
with family situations. It
tells about people who are
isolated and lost looking for
reasons to go on. Not all
episodes end happy, but
O’nan is quick to point out
that they are not negative.

“Some people will
describe it as pessimistic or
grim, but I don’t think so. I
think it contains a lot of
hope,” he said.

Tobias Wolff, the final
judge of the contest,
described In The Walled
City as “A remarkable book,
striking in the authority of
its storytelling, the direct-
ness of its language and the
depth of its moral imagina-
tion.” S

In a recent interview,
O’nan expressed his surprise

of being awarded the prize.

“I was astonished,” he said.

He was hoping to get the
NEA (National Endowment
for the Arts) grant, and on
the day he received his
rejection letter from it, he
got a phone call informing
him that he had won the lit-
erature award.

“The call came five min-
utes after I finished reading
the rejection letter,” he said.

O’nan, who said he has
eaten his share or hot dogs
at the “O,” took six years to

outdoor cafe

By Donald R. Lankey

For The Pitt News

The new outdoor cafe on the
William Pitt Union patio will open
this week. -

“We’re trying to offer students
more ﬂexibility with the outdoor
cart program, and we’ll develop
it more as we get responses
from the students,” .said Jim
Jenkins, the general manager of
operations for Marriott at
Put A’

The food stand, which is oper-
ated by Marriott Catering, dis-
plays sandwiches, salads, fruits,
chips and soft drinks.

“I’m really happy with the the

trying to make food more avail-
able for students and to enjoy the
outdoors,” said Betsy Farina, the
director of food services at the
university.

because CR “has a tendency to
attract bigots, racist and pigs.”

Lurie says that Davis is a
spokesperson for BAS, and as such
has attacked College Republi-
cans.

“When BAS, or Mr. Davis, calls
College Republicans racists, bigots
and pigs he is gravely insulting
myself, my board and the group of

Pitt’s college Republicans.”

Lurie demanded that Davis give a
public apology to Docherty, CR and
SGB member Grassia.

Grassia added that he has no
intention of halting his support of
CR, of which he is a member.

Student apathy will not improve,
Docherty said, if students cannot be
allowed to raise questions.

“What message does this send to

students? When a situation arises
you ask questions and you are
called a racist, bigot and a pig?”

‘CR Public Relations Director Chad
Devinney said that he wanted to
keep lines of communication open
with BAS.

“We don’t want this to be taken
as ‘us against them.’ Right now we
cannot argue against this, but we
can raise questions,” he said.

while the march on Washington is a
national event it has very strong
local consequences.

“You must let your community
know you are a part of their soci-

ety,” Young said. “You are respon-
sible for attaining your rights and

Student Andrew Greiner said that
he addressed Pittsburgh City
Council yesterday because he want-
ed to let the city of Pittsburgh know
he wasn’t going to tolerate sexual
discrimination. '

‘‘I told [City] Council there is a

difference between written rights
and actual rights. And the actual
rights have 21 long way to go,”
Greiner said. “We have protection,
but the protection to sue or press
charges after the crime is not help-
mg us.”

City Council handed Greiner a let-
tet that said Pittsburgh endorses the

Graduate

Continued from page 1

Another reason GSPIA graduates
have bright futures is because of the
steps GSPIA takes to prepare its stu-
dents and make them as attractive as
possible to future employers.

John Rinello, an international
affairs student in GSPIA, believes the
school helped him develop his own
personal strengths that will make
him a valuable asset to employers.

“We are trying to make our stu-
dents as marketable as possible,”
Bobrow said. “The [next five years]
look very encouraging to place peo-
ple. Things are definitely looking
towards a international and non-
profit trend. These are the types of
environments we train our students
to work in.”

“This degree gives me the flexibili-
ty to go public or private sector or to
go business or government ifI want-
ed,” Rinello said. “Employers really
like flexibility in a potential employ-
ee, they see it as an important
asset.”

Mark Nordenberg, dean of the
School of Law, faces a tough task of
preparing students from the Law
School for the future given the stag-
nation‘ in the law field.

“The market for lawyers is tight
right now,” Nordenberg said. “That

means the Law School has to make
every attempt to help its students be
aware of. the programs available to
them.” “

According to Nordenberg, the Law
School’s strength lies within the fac-
ulty.

“For a student, nothing is more
important than the quality of teach-
ing at a school,” he said. “We contin-
ue to be a school with a faculty that
has achieved a lot and
has a good reputation.”

Nordenberg said Pitt Law School
graduates are attractive to prospec-
tive employers because of the diver-
sity in its offerings.

“We have an array of degrees
offered in conjunction with the law
degree with other graduate schools
at Pitt and Carnegie Mellon
University,” he said. _

Frank Guadagnino, head recruiter
at Reed, Smith, Shaw and McClay,
one of Pittsburgh’s biggest law firms,
is pleased with the recruits he takes
from the Pitt Law School.

“Pitt [Law School] graduates do as
well at the firm if not better than any
other schools, including the ivy
league schools,” he said. “Three
people who were made partners last
year at the law firm were Pitt gradu-
ates.”

According to Guadagnino, his law

.. firm continues to recruit from Pitt

because of the graduates’ track
record.

“The overwhelming thing is the
historical success rate of people
here from Pitt,” he said. “.When we
take people from Pitt, it is not a risk.
People have done historically well
here.'Pitt graduates hold their own.”

Dean H.J. Zoffer, of the Katz
Graduate School of Business at Pitt,
said he is proud of the M.B.A. pro-
gram and the students at the school.

“Katz is a different kind of school,
we take from a wide range of

majors,” he said. “We want more -
balanced people to take on our .

M.B.A. program, the more well-
rounded our students are, the more
successful a manager they will be
when they go into the working
world.”

According to Zoffer, the Katz 11-
month M.B.A. program is a rigorous,
intense training for future business
workers that gives them a sense of
work ethic training. Recruiters who
come to Katz are impressed with the
program, he said. V

“With the exception of the
University of Michigan, Ford Motor
Corporation has more M.B.A.’s from
Pitt than any other school,” Zoffer

said. “Swissbank in New York only
takes M.B.A.’s from two schools in
this country, Pitt is one of them.”‘

David Cappezzuti, a Pitt M.B.A.
student with a concentration in
Human Resources, said he is happy
with the education he is receiving at
Katz Graduate School of Business.

“I feel the pacing was adequate
and helpful in preparing me for a
job down the road,” he said. “I had
to learn a lot of time management
and how to deal with a lot of pres-
sure. That will help me if I look for a
high—powered career. For the time
and money, I feel it’s really worth
it.”

Dean George M. Bernier of Pitt’s
Medical School said the curriculum
offered at the school is appealing to
students and it has raised the inter-
est of applicants.

“We really offer the students an
exciting first two years,” Bernier
said. “The school has created an
integrated approach to sciences and
clinical medicine.”

The integration between science
and clinical medicine is a problem-
based learning method presenting
medical students with imaginary
cases that require them to offer
solutions to the cases through
research.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, April 22, 1993

Snyder

Continued from page 3

lesson in advertising. “We moved the ad from the news
pages to the sports page,” he said.

His ads were aimed at the new drunken driving laws in
Pennsylvania. The new law could send the drivers to jail if
convicted. In two years, he had thesbiggest drunken dri-
ving practice in Pittsburgh, just from that ad, he explains.

He said, “I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life
defending drunk drivers.”

Defending innocent people who were injured rather
than the drunks who caused the accidents was more
appealing to him. That is when he decided to devote his
efforts toward the more profitable personal injury law.

While he somewhat changed the cases he was taking on,
he continued his advertising efforts. During this period it
managed to grow from one ad in The Pittsburgh Press to
ads in 27 newspapers all over Western Pennsylvania.

I was not the first area attorney to use advertising,
Snyder said. DeMay, DeMay and Donelly P.C. holds that
honor with Spector Law Offices. Snyder said he was the
first to go at it aggressively turning himself into a televi-
sion personality.

His television ads first appeared in the Johnstown area
where he opened his second office. Next he put an office
in Altoona and moved some of his commercials there.

In 1987, he added Pittsburgh to the cities in which his
commercials appeared. They turned out to be successful
here, also. '

A year later he put an office in Erie, Pa., advertising
there with his toll—free telephone number.

“[The Erie Bar Association] came out with an ad, for lack
of a better word, that said why you shouldn’t hire a lawyer
with an 800 telephone number,” Snyder said.

The Association’s plan backfired because he found out
that the more ads the bar association put on TV, the better
his business became. '

James Smith, executive director of the Allegheny Bar
Association, described Snyder as a pioneer whose com-
mercials are done well. He said there is nothing wrong
with lawyers that advertise when it is done tastefully, and I
believe Snyder accomplishes that.

Snyder explains that legal advertising is not a new thing.
Some people are just not as assertive about it.

“I recently read an article that said 75 percent of law
firms do some form of advertising or another,” he said.
Advertising is not just television or newspapers. It is also
yellow pages.

He added, if you pick up your yellow pages you can see
up to 45 pages of lawyers who advertise.

Snyder said, “All of the big law firms in the city of
Pittsburgh market, they just don’t do it on television.”
Adding, “Today the views [on advertising] are changing,
the only place where they are not changing is in the law
schools.”

There are a huge number of jobless lawyers out there.
Schools are not graduating them, considering they could
go out and open their own business, Snyder said.

Marketing involves" the act of moving goods from pro-
ducer to consumer. The lawyer is the producer and the
goods they produce is their knowledge of the law.

Snyder said students are not instructed in it because the
people within the law schools have not accepted market-
ing and advertising as being professional.

Professor Jules Burkoff of the Pitt Law School disagrees.
He claims marketing would not resolve the problem of the
growing number of workless lawyers.

“[The problem is] we can’t get lawyers to people who
need them or those cannot afford them,” Burkoff said.

Smith of the Allegheny County Bar Association agrees

with Snyder’s standpoint. He believesimarketing is impor-’

tant and law schools should add classes in that area.

He says, “Schools should teach how to start a practice
and how to market themselves.”

He says people who are injured in accidents are scared
and hurt. Law offices can be intimidating, so he makes
them feel more comfortable and visits them in their
homes.

When Snyder started his advertising and other innova-
tive ideas, he had one lawyer and one secretary working
for him. He started at a small storefront in Duquesne. Now
in all four of his offices over Western Pennsylvania he has
65 people that work on his staffs.

Today, when you step off the elevator on the 16th floor
of the Gulf Building in Pittsburgh, it is easy to realize he
occupies the whole floor. He says he uses most of another
one in the building also.

It is those types of ads that helped make Edgar Snyder
and Associates the 15th largest legal advertiser in the
United States, he said, and the number—one advertiser in
Pennsylvania.

HeKe, Kip...
You LOOK
THE. MOST.
DQSPQRGTQ.

It has been a long—standing tia-
dition for the out-going editors of
The Pitt News to write mushy
farewell columns. Although I am
all for tradition, I would rather
not bore you with weepy senti-
ment about how I have five
years of higher education under
my belt and will probably be
delivering pizza for a living. No, I
would rather take this rare col-
umn opportunity to do some-
thing I. have always wanted to
do: vent my frustrations.

You see, I am a conservative
journalist trying to break into the
industry that fuels my frustra-
tions. I have kept my burning
anger at the credibility given to

" idiots on both political extremes

inside for so long that Ivam on
the verge of explosion.

But I need a job. Somehow, I
have to keep my cool to have
any prayer of being hired in this
ocean of liberalism. So as step
one of my 12-step recovery plan,
my therapist recommended that I
release some of that tension now
in print before it is too late. So,
to preserve my sanity, here it
goes. I -

It has not been very fun being
a conservative for this traditional-
ly liberal newspaper. My col-
leagues have been pounding at
the remnants of Ronald Reagan
and the presidency of George
Bush and have ‘called me an
insensitive lout for not falling
into line with yunz’ bleeding-
heart agenda. Note.- I will address
you liberals as yunz. If you are
not from the ‘Burgh, go immedi-
ately to the South Side to find an
interpreter.

Yunz loved to criticize Bush’s
every move, the most popular
target being the United States’
involvement in the Gulf War.
Remember? That’s when all those
pseudo—ﬂower children, post-
modern hippie wanna-bes held
protests and free concerts on the
Union lawn. Guess what kids,
that gig’s been done before. It’s a
broken record and that’s why
nobody listens to you. It was

Parting Shots

A closet conservative comes out to vent and reflect

called the ‘60s. Just look at what
the real hippies are going to do
to our country now that they
have their anointed one in
power.

Speaking of the anointed one,
I thought the sparrow lady was
right and the world would end in
three days once I succumbed to
the reality that Bill Clinton was
our president. My road to recov-
ery will be paved by the mis-
takes this man will make and the

Jim
Lakely

daily pleasures it will give me to
slam him just as the liberals have

slammed my guys in office. Just’

remember that no one has ever
taxed a country into prosperity.

I feel better already. Now that
my head is cleared, I am going
to share some of my $10,000-
worth of wisdom with you with
more predictions.

Environmental extremists, from
Al Gore and Greenpeace at the
top to Pitt’s SEAC at the bottom,
will continue to preach pseudo-
science and gloom and doom
eco-apocalypse. And they will be
wrong. It has always annoyed
me that the unsubstantiated
opinion of a few scientists has
been able to whip this country
into an environmental frenzy.
Hey, guess what you tree-hug-
ging druids: The sky is not
falling! There are just as ‘many
reputable scientists who have
evidence that global warming is
is a myth, but they are not as
loud and obnoxious. Ignored by
these scare—mongers is the fact
that one volcano in the Pacific
rim spits more greenhouse gases
in one eruption than we have
done in our entire existence.
Look it up. Hey people (and you
know who you are), get a life,
get informed, get a job and get a
clue.

I want to close on a serious -

and certainly controversial note
with one last prediction: The

‘ Black Action Society will contin-

ue to complain loudly about any-

thing and everything. Let’s under- —

stand that this is a major part of
its job. Without raising hell, the

, BAS, like any other group, will

be ignored by the university
community. If no one pays atten-
tion to it, it loses its power. Its
rhetoric is elitist and separatist
and does much to alienate those
who would otherwise have sym-
pathy for its constant struggle
with Pitt administration and stu-
dents. Over the .years, “It’s a
black thing, you wouldn’t under-
stand” has been interpreted to
mean “Gimme what I want. Shut
up. You are stupid.”

C But right or wrong, through all
the crap, the group has always
been loud, and you may be sur-
prised to read that I am glad.
Whether or not you agree with it
or its methods, and personally I
often do not, you have to greatly
admire the political clout it has
gained and its organizational
skills. ’

With all the hell the BAS raises
and the eyeballs it has forced to
roll into the back of heads,
including my own very often, it
conducts a great service to all
students at Pitt. The group,‘ raises
awareness to black concerns in

the white community as much as »

blood pressures. Fused in
between the lines of the propa-
ganda and the political correct-
ness of its agenda are positive
messages for all students to learn
and grow from. I pray that peo-
ple do no_t grow tired of the
yelling and, like loud music in a

bar, phase it out. Then we all _

lose.

Whew! I’m all done. Now it is
time for me to grab my empty
McDonald’s cup and take my
place on the street along side the

other beneficiaries of the Clinton l—
economic plan. See ya at the .

welfare office.

THE Pl'l'l‘ NEWS, Thursday, April 22, 1993 . 9

Q New world order includes chaos, uncertainty and insecurity

As the end of the academic year comes to
a close, it seems an appropriate time to
remember the issues of the past and possibly
gain some insight into the future. Over the
past year, I have written a dozen articles over
a whole range of topics, both international
and domestic. I have written about the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
China, Quebec, Israel, North Korea and
South Africafl have written about the presi-
dential debates, Bill Clinton’s campaign
promises, racism in America, ‘ government

waste and social responsibility. What do they '

all have in common? Nothing? Look closer.
Look closer and you’ll see the shattered
dream of the New" World Order. Look closer
and you’ll see the future. And you’re not
going to like it

During the Cold War, the international sys-
tem in which we lived was rigid. Nations
were on one side or another and everyone
knew where things stood. Those nations that
didn’t take sides stayed quiet to avoid being

See the World and enjoy it

pulled into the fray. But now the rigid world
order of the Cold War has been shattered
and the world breathed a sigh of relief. “We
are safe,” they said. “No longer do we have
to live in fear for the future.” The world
seemed ready for a new order, a New World
Order that would usher in a period of peace
and cooperation in a world desperately in
need of a rest. But the rest is liable to be
short-lived and when the '

grow, the “little guy” would be protected
from his hostile neighbor and worid peace
would prevail.

Or we could all wake from our collective
dream and  a look at the harsh reality. It
is far more likely that the new order will be
built around not one, not two, but several
power bases. The opposing sides of our pre-
viously bipolar world will split and go their
separate ways. With no

pieces are picked up and
put back together, there’s
no guarantee what the
picture will be.

There are two possibil-

Mike
Brittingham

single, monolithic conﬂict
to threaten the world,
international cooperation
xx :1? lwmme a thing of the
past (rt it ever really exist-

ities. We may be able to construct a new
order around a single power base that is
acceptable to at least most of the worid. Such
a system would replace the anarchy of inter-
national relations with a single arbiter (like
the UN?) that wzould project the rule of law,
international law, around the world.
Democracy and freedom would spread and

ed). Anarchy will continue. Large nations will
continue to prey on their smaller neighbors.
World peace and the rule of international
law will remain the stuff dreams are vurde of.
It may give you a warm, fuuy feeliwrinside
about some utopian future, but it isn : reality.
The truth is, if we wake ourselves up and
really look at the world, we’ll see it dividing,

not coming together. NAFTA and the EC are
splitting the Western world into rival trade
blocs. China risks being torn by external
pressures for human rights and internal pres-
sures for economic growth. Quebec, Israel
and South Africa are struggling with varying
degrees of ethnic strife. North Korea and
Yugoslavia risk embroiling the world in
regional conﬂicts. Even in our own nation
there are devisive forces from growing social
problems to :1 growing national debt, endan-
gering our futrue.

The era of the Cold War is over. And with
it ends a certain degree of stability. The
pieces have been picked up, the puzzle is
being reconstructed and a new order is slow-
ly taking shape.

But it is not the New World Order that
many have envisioned. It is a New Worid
Chaos that threatens to make the future a
very risky place. And it is likely to be with us
for a long, long time.

Have a nice summer.

I walked into my economics class, late
as usual, and realized that the professor
wasn’t talking. Rather, it was a female stu-
dent from the Study Abroad Office. She
was talking about all the different places a
Pitt student can go in order to study
another language, experience a new cul-
ture or just see a different lifestyle than
our own. I never thought I would be able
to go abroad because_I didn’t have very
much money. I have to pay for my tuition
here at Pitt with financial aid and loans,
how could I go to a foreign country?!
When she mentioned that all of Pitt’s
financial aid can go toward Study Abroad
and how many scholarships were avail-
able, I got so excited that I went up to 4G

Forbes Quad right after class was over.
The interns in the Study Abroad

Resource Center were able to

American and Italian, so we learned things
from a variety of perspectives. And, since
all of the professors lived within the villa,
I got to know each of one of them very

well —— both in and out of the classroom.
Here I am, six months later, after the

best experience of my life. Going abroad
was a part of my life that I will always
remember. My mind was challenged every
day by new and exciting adventures. I
learned much‘ about myself but it was
through the eyes of another culture. I was
able to explore a different part of the
world while continuing with my educa-
tion. The things I was learning were right
in front of me. If I had to study a piece of
art all I had to do was go Downtown to
look at it! If I wanted to practice the lan-
guage I went to ‘a café and talked with the

people over a cappuc-

direct me to a program that
would suit me best. I wanted
to learn another language, but
I wasn’t quite ready to take
classes that weren’t taught in

cino. It was the most
fun I have ever had in
my life and I would
probably not be the
person I am today

had I not studied

English. I discovered that I I
could go anywhere I wanted.
Virtually every country I could
choose from had a program

people who are differ-
ent from myself I
remember what it was

guage of that country.

I decided that I wanted a program that
would allow me to study art history (my
major) and travel a lot. Ilfound a» program
in Florence, Italy that had everything I
wanted: classes in English, art history and

short class weeks so I could travel every

weekend. I lived in a renaissance-‘style
villa on the outskirts of the city. It had
beautiful formal gardens with fountains,

cooks were Italian, so you can imagine
how the food tasted. The professors were

like to be the
American in a foreign culture. I was the
one who was different. I remember how
friendly and helpful some of the Italians
were because they were curious about my
background. I learned there is always
something interesting to learn from other
people. I appreciate and treasure every
opportunity now. Instead of wondering
what could happen I make it happen.
Studying abroad opened the door in my
life to all of the opportunities that are pos-
sible. This is an experience that no Pitt
student has to miss!

Now when I meet_

The law does injustice to rape

Most rapists do not Ii.»-cc their vic-
tims to have sex at knife—point using

coaxing words.

Traditionally, a rapist has been
viewed by society as a deranged per-
son who commits an act of violence.
Many people cannot accept that
someone who would verbally coerce
his or her date into having sex may be

a rapist

Whether or not you think someone
should be convicted of a frrst—degree
felony for telling a date who refuses
sex, “Relax, you’ll like it,” the
Pennsylvania law believes it's OK. For
this reason, date rapists will continue
to slip through the cracks of justice.

Sexual inter-
COUYSC without con-
sent is rape. But the
law says rape is sex-
ual intercourse f‘by
forcible compulsion

or  threat of forcible compulsion.”

It is difﬁcult for anyone to view,
“Don’t be so uptight, you’ll like it,” as
forcible compulsion. It is not difficult

_ to view, “I’ll blow your head off if you .
 as the threat of forcible com-
pulsion But most date rapists use the

former weapon.

If a person is a child, unconscious
or mentally challenged, then he or she
has a good chance to convict the
rapist Engrging in sexual intercourse
with a person incapable of consenting
to sex is clearly defined under the law
as rape. But most rape victims do not
fall into these three categories. If the
victim is a third-year law student who
wasn’t raped at gun point and was
capable of consenting, it is nearly

impossible to prove in court he or she
was a rape victim. She, too, slips
through the cracks of justice.

Traditionally, society has viewed
sex as a husband’s “right” and a wife’s
“obligation.”

And so has the law. Before 1976
there was no such thing as a husband’
who raped his Wife. The law believed
that a woman, who agreed to mar-
riage, was therefore oblrgated to have
sex with her spouse anytime he
desired. Even today, the law makes it
more difficult for a woman, simply
because she is mzuried to her rapist, to
convict him. An out—dated clause that
forced women to file rape charges

months of the

rape victims ——

Casey

except those
manied to their rapists. According to
the law, the rapist has only commit-
ted a second-degree felony when that
victim is his wife.

Our legal system has been extreme-
ly harsh on victims and has been
extremely lenient on the majority
(those who do not rape children or
unconscious people or use a gun to
violate the most intimate part of a per-
son’s body) of rapists. lenient to the
point of being blind.

The law must make room for
rapists who are college—educated,
church—going, all-around nice guys.
Those who carry no weapon, just a
mind that believes what society has
taught him or him —- that it’s OK,
even when she says No.

When I think of Pitt I'll laugh a little and remember the fun

Only nine days left Thafs when
graduating seniors like myself ven-
ture out ofOakland and into a worid
where anything goes. One thing is
certain though, we will always carry
with us those precious and uncanny
memories of Pitt

These days, everything around me
is sentimental. Even on a routine
walk to class an encounter with nos-
talgia is imminent. So, whether its
some annoying sorority girl chatter-
ing about her hair in front of the
Union or some nervous guy in
Hillman library panicking about bro
kenprintersandapaperthatisdue
in 10 minutes, the scenes of Pitt are
going to be remembered

ter opened in my life. Take, for
instance my macroeconomics teach-
ing assistant. All this guy did was
chuckle at everything he said I never
thought supply and demand could
be so funny. ‘ ’

On a more sullen note, I found
out that college is not the romanti-
cized place where students party late
and skip classes. This revelation
came one late night on a dark South
Oakland street two years ago.
Walking down Parkview Avenue,
the kind of street where old Italian
couples casually stroll along as
though it is a sleet in Venice, some
guywalkeduptomeandbrokea

I sustained six stitches and an eter-

nal loss to my personal security.

— aside from writing for the Pitt
Aeus, off course — was spending a
semester abroad last spring at Tel

around with some of the best people
I have ever met give my life a new
perspective on how to appreciate the
world and myself. One time, while
standing in the middle of the Sinai

other than arid mountains and the
crystal blue sky. There was no law

and no parents, only a free-spirited
soul trying to ﬁgure out the world.

Back at Pitt life wasn’t quite a
scene out of :1 Bruce Springsteen

some treasured memories at some of
Oakland’s most unprecedented
places. I’ll always remember the ﬁrst

French fries. \Vrth his eyes busting

those greasy ﬂies hit his stomach, he
darted for the bathroom screaming
that he would never go to the

How about that accidental discov-
ery that Winners Oriental Restaurant
actually had good food and not just
cheap beer (that a toddler could pur-
chase)? Talk about surprises. How
about the fact that the cashier at
Jerrys Records isjerty?

Of course any discussion about
the unknown must mention some of
those grindy South Oakland base-
ment parties. You never know what
could pop up in the corner of some
of those places.

And I guess that’s what college is
— a quest to find out whats in the

Hurl spits out the word on themselves and local scene

By Michelle Kleinsak
Sta_17'Writer

I used to be able to say I’d never
seen a band kicked off stage for sim-
ply playing too loud That was until
last Friday afternoon when Hurl
took the corner stage at CMU’s carni-
val and played for a brief frve min-
tires, not including its sound check.
Apparently CMU security doesn’t
like the groups music good ‘n’ loud
like the rest of us. "

Matt Jencik, bassist and vocalist,
sarcastically addressed a waning
audience, “Thank you very much.
We’re Hud, the Pittsburgh band that
gets screwed the most” At that point
the woman standing next to me said
something to the extent of “They
wish.” Minutes later I found out that
she was Matfs mom.

After the musical strip tease, I
talked to the guys at Scotland Yard
and got the answers to the questions
the 10 people who are reading this
article might have. For being a band
fresh out of diapers, Hurl has a
sound rich enough to get even the
non-believers swaying in their
Chuck Taylors. The band consists of
Jencik (19), drummer David Brunger
(19), guitarist Mat Daly (18) and
newest addition, guitarist Dan
Wilson (22). Here’s what they had
to say:

MK: How did you guys meet’

DB: Dan landed on our ClOOIS[€p in
a basket.

MJ: Mat and I went to high school
together.  sernetinres went to
the same high" school when he went
to school. Dan’s way older. He’s
almost graduated frorn college. We
were a three—piece now we’re a
fotusome because Dan joined the
band.’

MIC Why did you think it was nec-

essary to add a second guitarist?

M]: For a full, thick sound It’s a real-
ly long story how Dan got in the
band.

DW: It’s actually pretty random. It
just sort of happened.

MJ: One of the reasons we don’t
play out much is because our gui-
tarist, Mat, goes to Syracuse.

MIC W'rll you be playing more this
summer?

DB: Oh yarh, every day. We have a
tour planned for the tri-state area.
MJ: Yeah, we have a Brazilian tour,
EOO.

MIC How did you guys pick your
name?

DB: Well, originally our name was
Clutch. And a friend of mine was
from Maryland, just outside
Washington, D.C., and he stole 210’s
name. They called themselves D.C.
210 because he thought that the
Pittsburgh scene was pretty cool. He
liked the name 210. So anyway, he
took our name of Clutch after I told
him that we were playing out under
that name.

M]: I was looking through a vinyl
catalog and I saw the Clutch 7-inch
and I was like, “Wait we haVen’t
released a 7-inch yet.”

DB; And I looked at the address and
it was the kids that Iknew.

MJ: And instead of. going through
the drawn-out  of picking a
name. I said, “Hurl-to throw. That
sounds cool.”

MD: It does not mean to blow gro-
ceries.

M]: We were sitting around my
kitcher: table and we said “hurl.” It’s

a short word. It’s like clutch, grab.
Unfortunately, the W/ayne’s Woﬂd
thing came out around the same
time.

DB: I hadn’t even heard of Wayne’s
World before the movie. I went to
Eide’s and I saw the poster. “You’ll
laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll huri.” But we
kept it anyway. We stuck to our
guns.

MIC Alright, who would you say are
your biggea inﬂuences? (Directed to
Matt) I see you’re wearing a Bitch
Magnet T—shirt. I’d say
“Americruiser” was an inﬂuence on
“Turnip.”

MD: That song, deﬁnitely.

MJ: Yeah, Seam are probably our
biggest inﬂuence.

DB: Sooyoung Parks. The man, the
legend. He demands respect I think
we all have different inﬂuences.

MD: Yeah, I deﬁnitely think we are a
multi-inﬂuence band.

MJ: We’re always compared to
Codeine and Slint and Bitch Magnet,
but we really don’t sound like any of
them. There are various moments
when we might sound like any of
them

DB: They span the entire 15-year

history of indie rock.

MK: OK, so what’s up with the
record deal’

(Unanimously) ‘We don’t know.”
MI: Iet’s just say that anybody who
even bothers to read this article will
know by now because it’s been

announced on the radio. We dis-
cussed this on the phone.

MK Well I’ve heard rumors 

DB: The rumors are ﬂying that we’ve
been signed to Geffen but we
turned them down. Warner Brothers
we did consider (laughter).

MJ: There’s one place that were
pretty much probably gonna do but
there's other things that we're con-
sidering that we want to leave open
just in arse.

DB: We’re positive about one.

MK: The only thing I’ve heard is
Alias.

M]: Yeah, well tlretes other places
that we like but we haven’t heard
any feedback from yet..

A brilliant look at the Faust legend in Havel's Teintatio

   

By Lori M. Bossert
Staﬂ‘ Writer

What is truth’ Whose version of
this truth should we believe? And
who should we trust’

These are questions that have
been keeping philosophers (and
the rest of us) up all night since the
cavemen got beyond food and
shelter. It’s been a long time since
Ive seen them so brilliantly treated
as in Temptation, by Vaclav Havel.

Produced at the City Theater,
Temptation is Havel’s brilliant
reworking of the Faust legend.
Doctor Faustus was the archetypi—
cal scientist of the Renaissance. He
was devoted to the study of science
and the pursuit of the higher truths
behind science. According to leg-
end, his search for these elusive
truths became his downfall —— lead-
ing him first to the devil then death
and hell. Perhaps the best—known
version of this legend is
Christopher Marlowe’.s famous
play, The 'lrcigi'ccilH1'str)ijyo/‘Doctor
l~'aiistzis. written in 1583.

Temptation revisits these scenes
in the context of a nameless, totali-
tarian society of today’s world. All
but two of the characters are scien-

_tists employed by “The Institute.”
Initially, we don’t know much
about “The Institute,” has two
major goals — the advancement of
science and to combat all beliefs

other than pure science. As is the
case with many totalitarian regimes
of today, science is the only*allow-
able religion in Havel’s nameless
society.

Havel then retells the Faust leg-
end against this politically—charged
background. The play opens with
a blackout. A single candle is lit,
illuminating the face of Dr. Henry
Foustka (Larry John Myers). He
proceeds to light five more candles,
draws a chalk circle around them
and begins to recite an incantation
from a leather tome. A knock
comes at the door, and he guiltily
starts then quickly replaces the evi-
dence. It would not do for Foustka,
one of the premier scientists of the
institute, to be caught practicing the
taboo “black magic.”

The play unfolds from there.
Foustkas visitor is an eerie, hunch-
backed man calling himself Fistula
(Martin Giles) and claiming to be a
sorcerer. He offers to introduce
Foustka to the world of black

magic. Foustka accepts his offer to

explore this forbidden ground —— a
decision which ultimately will
destroy his career, his relationships
and his soul  although not in the
conventional sense.

Myers is sensational as Foustka, a
man who is searching for the truth
and ﬁnding it to be an elusive quar—
ry. The inner struggles his character

It appears that something
big is happening. You can lis-

you can read about it in Spin
and every alternative dish rag
you can get your paws on.
And I, in my final article, get
the pleasure of writing about
it. Actually, it’s them  Come,
the Indie world’s new critic’s
darlings, surging past
Pavement, Superchunk and
others to be honored the
throne that they probably

never wanted.

Come, by now you’ve heard
of ‘em, or it. They're really not
sexy or romantic, in fact
they’re kinda dirty, dark,
brooding, slow and melodic.
But damn, critics and fans are
lapping at them. Lets observe:

Bob Mould, former Husker
Du-er and now Sugar—coated
said Come’s debut LP (read:

Records, Eleven.-Eleven was his
favorite of the year, so he told
Spin magazine, who in turn
plugged Come into their heavy

funny. The New Yorleer (I’m .

tellin’ ya they’re big time)
called ‘em “mesmerizing.” But,
they described Live Skull as
art-rock in the same article.
There’s a connection here,
because Thalia Zedek used to
be in Live Skull, now she leads

now present off-shoot Royal
Trux, which someone once
described as the Rolling Stones
if they took a lot of drugs.
Which led me to ask if that
person had ever taken any
drugs. And now, it’s Come that
is bearing the Stones’ moniker.

I’m starting to get pissed.
“Come’s bleak, gnarly music
sounds like a postpunk deriva-
tion of the miasmic Exile On

Boston quartets Eleven: Eleven
is Exile On Main Street from a
darker place” (RIP). You bet,
it’s from that dark place that

write ridiculous false analogies
so people will think you know
what you’re talking about. I’ve
done it, but I’ve never been
stupid enough to compare any

Zedek used to be a heroin
junkie, but she’s become a bit
more social these days and her
band is surging. It seems
everyone likes them, putting
me in a minority that I prefer.
But, I’ll be there anyway to see
Zedek. You can say anything
you want about Come, but not

about her, especially when .

DCDC bringing alive the African-American spirit of movement

By Michelle Grant
Staff Writer

“How shall we dance about the negro?” said
dance historian Cynthia Sithembile West in a recent work-
shop, “\Vho shall we be?’
* 4 These are questions African-American
dancer/choreographers have been and are still asking
, themselves, regarding their heritage in the dance world.
They were either proving they could dance like Europeans
or being comfortable and proud to dance their own lega-
cy.
Members of The Dayton Contemporary Dance
 Company (DCDC), along with three dance historians from
 the American Dance Festival, including Joe Nash, Cythnia
Sithernbile West and Dr. Gerald Myers, who is the projects
director, have been presenting workshops to dance afr-
. cionados and students at city schools and Pitt during their
week—long residency in Pittsburgh. A stay that will come to
a close when they perform at the Fulton Theater this Friday
and Saturday.
The DCDC is described by many acclaimed dance
critics is a “young, ﬁery, energetic, emotional and talented”
group of dancers. Its diverse repertoire includes the works
of African—American choreographers including: Tally
Beatty, Eleo Pomare, Kevin Ward, Donald L cKayle, Alvin
Ailey and George Faison. Works by some of the aforemen-
tioned choreographers will be performed this weekend.
Jeraldyne Blunden is artistic director of DCDC and
founded it in 1968. Her vision is to see the company
become one of the foremost in the world. And with that in‘
mind, the company has an eclectic and varied repertoire of
African-American works, classical and avant garde.

They recently came off a tour in Russia and
Gemiany and, after Pittsburgh, they will do residencies and
performances in New Mexico. They’ve increased their
touring schedule in part, due to support from The
American Dance Festival, which initiated a project to dis-
seminate the works of great African-American choreogra-
phers and to preserve classic dance works. The
project, called The Black Tradition in American Modern
Dance is toruing because many of those choreographers
have chosen DCDC to reconstruct their works upon the
16 dancers. Dance historians have also toured
with the company to further elucidate the contribution and
impact of African—'American choreographer/dancers and
‘ traditions.

Many of the early African—American choreogra-
phers got their inspiration from religion, spirituals, poets,
writers and music — especially jazz. The black
dancer/choreographers, according to Joe Nash, dance his-
torian, “contributed their heritage and hope for a better
future.”

Parity dominating hip-hop, MC Champion Wanted!



By J. D. and Pugs
The Pitt News '

In 1992 (and ‘93 to date) We
saw superstar hip-hop artists
lay their big reputations on the
line — artists like Heavy D, Ice
Cube, Dr. Dre and Naughty By
Nature. With these big reputa-
tions come expectations —
expectations to produce bril-
liance. A pair of these artists,
Dre and Heavy D., solidified
their place in hip-hop history
through their recent efforts,
while Cube and Naughty may
have taken a step backwards.
Here is a glance at what went
down with these artists, as well
as what new artists look hot at
the moment.

-Dre’s solo debut, The
Chronic, should be considered
one of the finest rap LPs ever,
boosted by his superior pro-
duction and the tremendous
writing of Snoop Doggy Dogg
and the D.O.C. With cuts such
as “Let Me Ride,” “Lil’ Ghetto
Boy,” “B—tches ain’t Sh~t” and
the massive hit “Nuthin’ But A
‘G’ Thang,” Dre has cemented
his foothold among the truly
elite in hip-hop. The writing
and smooth lyrical flow of
Snoop Doggy Dogg leaves you
waiting for his solo debut,
Doggv Style, set for release later
this year.

-Heavy D. came back with
the single “Who’s The Man?”
reminiscent of his first single,
“Mr. Big Stuff,” where Heavy
demonstrated his trademark
braggadocio lyrical flow. With
tracks produced by DJ. Premier
and Eddie F., Heavy planted
himself firmly back into the
limelight.

-Now Ice Cube is a point of
contention for us. J.D. says the
Cube made a big mistake by
changing up his style, sounding
too much like Da Lench Mob.

Another glaring weakness on
most tracks was the conspicu-
ous absence of Sir jinx and DJ
Pooh. Pugs agrees to a point_,
but feels The Predator was still
one of the most solid top to
bottom albums of the year. J.D.
believes that Cube could have
risen to a level all his own by
staying with the format that
made AmerileleIea’s Most
Wanted and Death Certificate
classics. Pugs warns that Ice
Cube’s rep is still in tact and
with a return to that old crew,
he could be back on top auto-
matically.

-As far as Naughty By Nature
goes, J.D. and Pugs are in com-
plete agreement on this one.
19Naug/9tyIII was a major dis-
appointment. With the com-
mercial smash of “Hip Hop
Hooray,” ]ersey’s finest kept its
sales but lost some of the ﬂavor
that was prevalent on its stellar
debut effort.

-J.D.’s Top New School
Artists:

1. The Pharcyde —— a definite
best buy. _

2. Onyx — rugged.

3. Biggie Smalls — look out
for it.

4. The Beatnuts

5. The Coup

6. Illegal — given some matu-
rity and nurturing by Erick
Sermon, this duo will be one to
look out for.

7. Boss

8. 3rd Eye

9. Erick Sermon — not a new
jack but now on his own.

10. New Basix/Chilly Most

-J.D.’s Hot Picks

1. Super Cat — “Dolly My
Baby”

2. Funkmaster Flex —-— “Six
Million Ways To Die”

5. Pharcyde —-— “Passin Me

9. Flavor Unit MCs——— “Roll

10. Geto Boys —— “Six Feet

-Pugs’ Hot Picks

1. Onyx — “Slam”

2. Pharcyde —-— “Passin Me

3. Dr. Dre — “Dre Day”

4. L.L. Cool J (Featuring Lords
of the Underground.) — “No

5. Flavor Unit MCs— “Rol1

6. Naughty By Nature —— “The

7. Boss —-— “Deeper”

8. House Of Pain — “Who’s
The Man”

9. Geto Boys —-— “Six Feet
Deep” 9

10. Erick Sermon — “Hittin
Switches”

-With the breakup of EPMD,
we lost one of hip hop’s truly
consistent acts. But with acts

like Onyx,
Beatnuts, J.D. says hip hop is
definitely back on track. Look
out for A Tribe Called Quest’s

third album Midnight
Marauders- Undoubtedly, the
Tribe has the ability to garner
the rap throne. Its smooth style
flows from coast to coast,
impressing even the hardest of
the hard. The title is Tribe’s for
the taking.

it was the “Break up with your
 record of the year.

M]: I hope someone’s watching our
equipment.

MK: Being from the suburbs, how
do you feel you fit in to the
Pittsburgh scene? .

M]: We are the Pittsburgh scene.
DB:Therearesomanybands.There
is ‘no Pittsburgh scene.

DW: Yeah, there is.

MK: I remember talking to you
before and you said that it was hard
at ﬁrst being from outside city limits
when most of the other bands are all
ﬁom around Squirrel Hill.

M]: We weren’t that accepted at first
DW: That’s not true at all.

DB: I think we’re accepted better
outside the city than in the city.

MJ: That’s not it either. It’s not the
people here. Well, see, the ﬁrst few
times we were played before we
even played out, we were compared
to Bitch Magnet and Codeine. When
we played we still hadn’t even got-
ten our style yet because that was
before we even did the record. We
were still beginning. So people saw
us and, unfortunately, we were
given a tag and they said we didn’t
sound like that. Then we gradually
fomied into that. I think we took to
the scene because we don’t sound
like anybody else. One thing that’s
cool about Pittsburgh now is that the
bands are all so different There’s a
common tie to each of the bands.
But, you really can’t notice it unless
you listen to all of the music. It‘s like

  

  

  
 
  

  

you can’t compare us to Don

Temptation

Continued from page 12

grapples with are present every
moment he is on stage. His face
twists, his lists are clenched and
he is totally absorbed with
himself at every moment.
As his career and relationships
unravel, he weaves a web of
lies so complex and double-
dealing that he is caught and
immobilized within them.
Myers’ emotional energy is
seemingly boundless as the tor-
tured scientist. He discovers
the depths of his character’s
dark side with vision and pas-
sion -

Equally impressive is Martin
Giles as the devil’s advocate,
Fistula. From the moment he
slithers into Foustka’s apart-
ment,‘ he is an eerie, controlling
presence in the scientist’s life.
Giles is truly creepy in this role.
He leers and cackles his way
through the show, yet poses
questions to Foustka that tor-
ment many. “I am a catalyst” he
 “I bring out that which is
already present within you.”
Fistula helps to take hold of
Foustka’s alienation and fear
and pushes him to utilize these
emotions ——- to his eventual
destruction, of course. But at
the end of the play, he merely
points out that Foustka’s fall
was ultimately of his own mak-
ing.

The supporting cast arelalso
strong performers as well.
Laurie Klatscher is a complex
Vilma, playing the role with an
interesting’ mix of aggression
and T vulnerabiility;’°‘”‘5"T§rom
Delventhal, Kelly Buzalka,

Douglas Rees, Patrice DeGraff-
Arenas and Paul Mochnick all
turn in fine performances as
Fouska’s colleagues. And Gene
A. Saraceni’s director is perfectly
corrupt. ,

Director Mladen Kiselov’s
interpretation of Havel’s script is

unusual and compelling. There

is an unreal feeling to the play
as if we were watching a grace-
ful nightmare. Beautifully
staged, the characters are artful-
ly placed in every scene often
revealing their alliances and
emotions with a single gesture.
This sometimes gives the play
an almost vision-like quality.
This quality of nether-reality
gives an interesting feeling to
the play. It has a very stylized,
formal feel at times. This
approach is extremely well suit-
ed to the production, but some
theatergoers may find it harder
to relate to than more traditional
offerings.

The play’s ﬁery climax is a
dense macabre of trust and
betrayal, the greatest of which is
Foustka’s betrayal of his own
ideals. Left in a hell of his own
making, he is alone with his tor-
tured soul and his memories.
The playsﬁnal, silent image of
Foustka staring into a single, lit
candle as his one remaining
friend looks on speaks more
eloquently of his suffering than
any wordscan. B , , V

Gurus

By Brian er
and Rob Pugliese
NBA Gurus

After dealing out our individual props
yesterday, we’re back to wax prophetic
on the hectic lunacy known as the NBA
playoffs. Mark Jones is still sleeping so ——
hey, ESPN, can we get a job?

BG’S EASTERN OUTLOOK: Clearly the
stronger of the two conferences, the
NBA’s Eastern half of hoops features three
of the four best teams in the NBA: the
Chicago Bulls, the New York Knicks and
the Cleveland Cavaliers. Plain and simple:
one of these three teams will win the East.
Why? Team leaders.

While all three squads boast a different - 

fomiula for success —— high—skilled bruis-
ing defense in New York; transition attack
in Chicago; and precision offense in
Cleveland — there is one common rea-
son why this trifecta stands apart from the
rest who will challenge for the NBA
crown: a master ring leader. -

You’ll be hard pressed to find three
tougher competitors who get more from
their respective skills than Cleveland’s
Mark Price, Chicago’s Michael Jordan and
New York’s Patrick Ewing. What they
mean to their squads transcends the stat
sheet and translates to victories. That
alone makes them three-stride favorites
over young but playoff—innocent teams
like New Jersey, Charlotte and Orlando.

The matchups. While there are a few
spots to be had at the bottom of the east-
em half, the only real matchup of note to
be decided comes this Sunday. That when
the Bulls and Knid<s play for the No. 1 seed
in the Eastern playoffs. Not only will the two
squads play for the right to own homecourt
advantage during the first three rounds of
the playoffs, they’ll be fighting for a chance
not to meet Cleveland in round two of the
big show.

Cleveland is the hottest team in hoops —
winners of a season—high nine straight.
Although most NBA gurus have labeled the

Cavs a soft playoff team, neither the Knicks
nor the Bulls wish to meet this potentially
dangerous squad any sooner than the
Eastern Conference finals. Of the two teams,
the Bulls have had the least success with the
Cavs in ‘92-’95 —— going 2-3 versus the
Richfreld Gymrats.

Whats going to happen’ Here goes. Look
for the Knicks to grab homecourt with a big
win Sunday, which in turn will pit Cleveland
and Chicago for their umpteenth playoff

 \‘-

series — this one in round two. Of the five
teams seeded three through eight, the pre-
tenders outnumber the contenders 3-2, with
New Jersey and possibly Orlando causing a
bit of a ruckus in the early rounds.

Bottom line prediction: the Bulls will lose
their throne to the Cavs in the second round
—— Cleveland will finally exorcise the
demons of M] and the Buzzer-Beater.
Unfortunately for Cleveland fans, the Cavs
will then yield to the gamey Knicks in a

seven-game battle for the Eastern throne.
PUGS’ EASTERN OUTLOOK:

Three titans ready to cause a giant

ruckus — in New York, Chicago and

  

conferences.

The physical Knicks are the tough-
est team in basketball, the Bulls — the
ringbearers and two—tirne defending
champs withmaybe that one more run in
them and the oft-forgot but oh-so-lethal
Cavs are the most disciplined club in the
NBA.

Three different flavors, all capable
of putting together the brilliance it takes
to win four straight series in the intensi-
fied, death—struggle known as the play-
offs.

Take your pick.

It will be these three, and the rest
can just play for the experience. A
healthy New Jersey outfit, with both
Kenny Anderson and Chris Dudley in the
lineup, might have made a difference.
But the Nets have not been anything
close to healthy in months and will settle
for a brief appearance in the second
round at best.

Aside from Jersey, the only other
club that should cause some discomfort
in the early rounds is Charlotte. But the
Nets, Hornets and Magic are here just to
learn the rules in ‘93. The only real ques-
tion at this point is who will enjoy the
homecourt advantage for the expected
Knicks-Bulls war -—— more importantly,
who will avoid the scorching Cavs, a

fine—tuned motion offensive machine.

The Knicks will knock off M] and crew in
Sundays regular season finale, earning the
the top seed and breeze-easy route to the
Conference Finals. Once there, the nasty-
boys of NYC will be tough to take out.

‘Gonzo’ solidiﬁes shortstop, leads
early surge by Panther baseball

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther baseball
team has soared to the upper
echelon of the Big East, win-
ning two of three against St.
John’s, splitting games with
UConn and Villanova and,
most recently, sweeping con-
ference powerhouse Seton
Hall.

No one player has had more
to do with the winning than
junior spark plug
Gonzalez.

Gonzalez has given the
Panthers what they have sorely
lacked for the previous few
seasons — a steady shortstop.

“He’s done a great job in the
field and he really solidified
shortstop,” Jackson said. “That
was a real problem with us a
couple of years ago. Danny’s
like a bona fide shortstop —— he
can make all kinds of plays.”

But Gonzo, as he is known
on the team, transcends steady.
He currently‘resides ninth in
the order but first in the Big
East batting with a .500 aver-
age. Despite his 5-foot 8-inch,
160-pound frame, the man can
hit.

“He’s not a big guy, but
when he gets up in clutch situ-
ations he does the job,” second
baseman and double—play part-
ner Brad Reese said. “When
you get up there as a nine bat-
ter it’s supposed to be an auto-
matic out and Gonzalez is just
the opposite.”

“[Opposing head] coaches

‘think that he’s an out when
they look at him and see his

size,” head coach Mark Jackson
said. “Of course, if they got a
stat sheet, which‘all teams do,
then it’s got to be obvious to
them that he’s hitting the ball.”
Gonzalez has moderated his

Danny .

stance just slightly since the
beginning of the season, and it
is paying huge dividends.

“I made a couple little
changes from earlier in the
year — I’m throwing my hands
a little bit more,” he said. “But
I’m just lucky to be hitting this
well.”

“This well” is seven straight
hits during the Seton Hall
series and a total of seven RBIs
in the two games.

“I knew I was doing well, but
I didn’t know how well,” he
said. “I try not to think about it.
You just go up there and hit
the ball.”

Despite his lofty offensive
numbers, 14-24, with an on-
base percentage of .586 (sec-
ond in the conference) and
with nine RBIs, the East Pearl,
Pa., native has impressed the
crowds at Trees Field with his
immaculate glove at short.

“He takes control out there,
and that’s all you can ask from
your shortstop,” Reese said.

With Gonzalez a fixture at
short, it provides a steady dou-
ble-play combination for pitch-
ers and the rest of the defense.
Reese, a senior, says he has
worked with no one better in
his career.

“I work with him better than
I’ve worked with any other
shortstop in my career,” Reese
said. “He’s just a duplicate —
we always know what each
other is thinking. As far as
communication goes, that’s a
plus for us.

“I feel we have one of the
best double—play combinations
in the Big East and I think our
pitching staff and our whole
team is aware of that, which
definitely helps the pitchers
because when they get a guy
on first and they hit a ground-
ball they know there’s going to

STUDENT 

GVERNMEN T

Student Government Board

be a double—play. That gives
them a little bit of confidence.”

Gonzalez’s consistency in the
field is a product of a most
obvious characteristic on the
field —— intensity.

“His style of play is just very
aggressive, which tends to
make people be like that and
tend to make people play like
he’s playing,” Reese said. “He’s
always mentally in the game,
which is another plus. You got
to show up there but you have
to be mentally in the game,
too.

“He’s an extremely competi-
tive person, and of the kind of
guys that you want to see up in
that situation, he’s one of
them,” Jackson said. “He’s
always in the game —- you hear
his voice over here all the time.
He’s very vocal.”

Gonzalez played on a nation-
al championshipteam last sea-
son at Essex Community
College in Baltimore. A mem-
ber of the All—Region Team, he
was also named Outstanding
Defensive Player at the ‘nation-
al tournament.

“I know he was a big part of
the reason they won, not just
because of his performance but
because of his leadership -
he’s real enthusiastic,” Jackson
said. .

The praise Gonzalez has
received is hardly menial. It
has come from one of the
University of Pittsburgh’s best
all-time second basemen: Brad
Reese, who resides atop the
conference’s batting charts
with a .500 average and is 10th
in the league with 10 runs
scored.

“I’ve never worked with a
better shortstop,” Reese said. “I
think that Mark Jackson’s best
recruit was to get him, and it’s
beginning to show.”

Pitt men's track runs
into the Penn Relays

Byjason Feuchtwanger i
Staff Writer

It’s time for the Pitt
men’s track team to get
excﬁed.

The team will travel to
Philadelphia to start com-
petition today in the
biggest meet of the season.
Sure there are the Big East
Championships coming up
next week and there is the
NCAA National
Championship meet at the
end of the season, but
nothing is like competing
in the Penn Relays.

“You can’t help but get
excited, you’re going to be
in front of 40 0 50,000 peo-
ple,” Pitt head coach John

“ Vasvary said.

According to Vasvary,
the Penn ‘Relays is like no
other meet in the country.

“You go to the Penn
Relays and it’s alwhole
new experience,” Vasvary
said. “It’s a carnival, it’s a
circus, people are selling
T-shirts, food and all kinds
of trinkets. You have the
field events, the relays,
high school competition
and people warming up all
at the same time. It’s a real
zoo.” 1

Senior Brian Whitley,
who will run the 400-meter
leg on the distance medley
team, said he is excited
about the meet because of
the numbers of people that
will be there and that he
will have his family in the
stands.

“I want to go out and run
my best. My mom and dad
will be there, and there are

_ put and discus, said the

just so many people that
are going to be there,”
Whitley said.

The Panthers, however,
don’t need the crowd to
get them excited. They are
looking forward to facing
some of the best competi-
tion they have seen all sea-
son.

“This is the best competi-
tion they will see all year
[besides the NCAAsl,”
Vasvary said. “You want to
stand up and be counted,
so to speak. For the young
guys, this will be a learning
experience. For the juniors
and seniors, they’ve been
there before and they want
to accomplish something.
It’s a great opportunity to
perform at your best 
This is the national cham-
pionships, in a way, for
some kids.”

“You have to focus. This
meet is the big one,”
Whitley said. “You want to
make Pitt look good.”

Mike Umbleby, who will
lead off for the distance
medley team with the
1,200-meter run, says he is
excited about the competi-
tion as well.

“The competition will be
great,” Umbleby ‘said.
“We’re excited. It’s my first
time [running in the Penn
Relays], so I want to make
a good impression.” 0

want to do well, it’s just a
matter of keeping your head
on straight and not letting all
the people get to you,” Monk
said.

The Penn Relays come at a
good time for the Panthers.
Team members say_ they want
to make a strong showing at
this meet and feel that they
are peaking at the right time.

y“We’re all confident,”
Umbleby said. “A lot of_us
have run PRs [personal
records] in the past few
weeks. Last week’s meet [the
Panther Relays] gave us a
good workout and showed us

where we are [in terms of per-

go.”

I threw my best in the dis-

“If I go [to the Penn Relays]
and come home with a PR I’ll
be happy.”

Hurdler Johnathan Dixon
tuned in his best performance
in the 110 hurdles last week-
end as well.

Hopefully, for Pitt, they can
use the encouragement from
last weekend’s meet and the
excitement of this weekend to
turn in their best perfor-
mances of the year at one of
the biggest meets of the year.

baseline and Tony Campbell ready
to provide that occasional pinch of
instant offense, the Knick front-
court has no equal.

The big story in the East, howev-
er, will be the T oo Nice Crew from
Cleveland. Sony M] lovers, but the
Cavaliers are playing tremendous
ball and now have the conﬁdence
necessary for derailing the Chicago
express. Brad Daugherty has the

series of his life and Mark Price

owns BJ. Amistrong during the
Cavsf second-round KO of the
Bulls.

The key to-the Eastern Finals
could be John Starks. The most
explosive Knick (both his game
and his attitude) holds New York’s
title hopes in his streak—shooting
hands.

Look for Pat Riley to use both
Doc Rivers and Greg Anthony at
point in an effort to wear down
Price. The Cavs will perform much
better than they did in the regular
season against NY, but the Knicks
take the series in six.

BG’S WESTERN OUTLOOK:
Two words sum up the battle for
Western supremacy: Phoenix-

Seattle.

No one else matters, no one else
can compete.

Simple. Direct. Dominant.

Like the Suns and Sonics.

The reason things are so clear
cut in the West comes down to the
two ingredients needed to win a
championship: defense and a
major league leader. Seattle and
Phoenix each have a facet of the
formula ——- the Sonics stomping
opponents with suffocating
defense; the Suns riding the
overkill tactics of Charles Barkley,
the 1993 NBA Most Valuable
Player (if there is any justice). The
rest of the‘ West consists of one-
man shows (San Antonio,
Houston) and ﬁrst-round pack it in
squads (both Los Angeles teams
and Utah).

The decision as to whether the
NBA Finals will feature a Round
Mound or a Green “D” Machine.
That will ride on whether Phoenix
can play defense — plain and sim-
ple.

The Suns have the best talent in
the league. (How does Dan
Majerle, Richard Dumas, Kevin
Johnson and Danny Ainge throw

..

ya?) But they’ve yet to consistently
shutdown opponents on the
defensive end. Then again, they
haven’t had to, yet.

Bottom line prediction: Forget
the early rounds save the San
Antone-Portland hookup. Wait ‘til
Houston and Seattle meet in
Round Two. A

If Seattle is able to manhandle
the Rockets in five or less, look out
Phoenix. Otherwise (and most
probably), look to Phoenix as the
cream of the Western crop.

The Suns will play defense.
They will satisfy their looning fol-
lowing. They will upstage Seattle’s
guard show in six games.

They better, because whoever
they face for the NBA crown —— be
it New York, Chicago or Cleveland
— they’ll be head and shoulders
better than any squad they face in
the West.

PUGS’ WESTERN OUTLOOK:
The land of lost opportunity.

Portland’s prime has passed it
by. Ditto for Utah. San Antonio’s
ﬂash of brilliance has fizzled.
These clubs have lost the magic,
while a perennial playoff frustra-
tion victim, retooled Phoenix, is

poised for a hell-bent run towards
the Finals.

Charles Barkley and his boys
have only two real obstacles,
Seattle and Houston — the young
guns and the one-man wrecking
crew.

The Sonics have their ups ‘n’
downs with funky dunkmaster
Shawn Kemp leading the charge.
George Karl will have Kemp, Gary
Payton and Derrick McKey primed
for the playoffs.

This trio is not new to the gruel-
ing postseason grind. While still
young, Seattle does have signifi-
cant playolf experience and cagey
vets in Rickey Pierce and Sam
Perkins. Do not underestimate the
value that Perkins brings to this
club, not just in the boxscores, but
with his savvy.

The Rockets cannot seriously
threaten for the Finals despite their

tremendous regular season and

unstoppable force in Hakeem
Olajuwon.

The reason: depth. Phoenix and
Seattle will run too many players at
the Rockets.

Look for Portland to take out
San Antonio in an entertaining

- THE pm NEWS, Thursﬂ, April 22, 1993

first-round matchup. The Blazers
will then get bounced by Phoenix
in five. The Sonics and Rockets
wage war in round two with the
green machine prevailing to the
West ﬁnal.

But Phoenix is too much.
Regardless of questions about their
defense and small frontcourt, the
Suns have the most lethal transi-
tion game in the league and two
intangibles that make them the
overwhelming choice —— heart and
attitude. Barkley, along with
Danny Ainge, Dan Majerle and
Kevin Johnson have bonded into
the most intense group of leaders
in the game. With young horses
Richard Dumas, Cedric Ceballos
and Oliver Miller, Phoenix has the
deepest and most talented club,
just too much in a seven—game
series.

Phoenix takes Seattle in six.

BG’S FINALS OUTLOOK:
Defense and frsticuffs, the Knicks
