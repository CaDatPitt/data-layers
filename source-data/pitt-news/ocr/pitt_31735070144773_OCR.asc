Sparta Editor

It’s just after 3:30 p.m. on Tues- ’

day afternoon, and Diejuan Blair is
the center of attention.

Preparing to board the team bus
to the airport, Blair‘ answers ques-
tions from a crowd of reporters
about "his upcoming matchup with
Xavier, the pressures of playing in
the Sweet 16 and, mos_t of all, the
chance at making history in the

'  Tournament.

Turns out, at least in the-city of

E ‘ Pittsburgh, Blair mightibe closer to

history than even he 
Turn back the calendar 80 years

' to when Pittsburgh, as diverse a c'ity
, as any at the time, is host to two of

the greatest Negro League baseball
teams ir1 history: the Homestead
Grays and the Pittsburgh Crawfords
Like Blair last season for the Pitt has-
ketball team, an 18-year-old righty by
the name of Josh Gibson was be—
corning the heart of his sport.

chasing Pittsburgh history

So what could Gibson, a Hall of
Fame Negro ‘Leaguer who thrived
in the 1930s have in common with
Blair, a center for the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team? It takes a history lesson
to really understand. '

’ 1’ Gibson moved from_ .Georgia
to Pittsburgh when he was 11 and
lived in the  District He played
baseball for both the Grays and the
Crawfords throughout his entire Ne-

gro League career before his death in

1947. ‘ _

Speed ‘dating’ event sparks business relationships

11:25 a.m.

Pairs of men and women don-

Bhojak sat alone two rota-

relationships are all business for

For 14 businesses and more

the Innovator’s Speed Dating
Event on Tuesday created new
relationships, but not of the to-

Business representatives sat

At the end of each period, an

You’ve i probably. seen the ‘ads
around campus: The inside of the Pe-
tersen Events Center is shown in. full

in NCAA glory; but in front of the shot I.

are two ﬁgures with their arms raised
in celebration ——~ silhouettes with _the
words “suspend ” and “on proba-
tion’.’ across their chests. The message
is clear and unambiguous’, but in case
you missed the point, the test in the
ad endswith the words “celebrate re-
. sponsibly.” The subtext: “Or you’ll get
burn ” .
February/s Super Bowl riots seem

to have sent a shockwave through the -

Pitt community, and now, with the po-
tential for another major celebration

All of this is a marked change from
February, which apparently caught
both police and University ofﬁcials

by surprise Since then, the University

has made it clear exactiy what kinds of

"The students vomd on aititle for
the concert They thought that would
be like  from normal life,

Susan Gillis—Kruman, adviser and di-
rector of Pitfs Dance Ensemble

"This year’s guest‘ choreographers
were local Dance Alloy Theater edu-
cation director Greer Reed-Jones and
former Dance Alloy Theater dancer
and adjunct Pitt dance instructor Mi-
chelle Hall Dawson.

New Orleans,” said Reed—]ones about
her choreographed work, “Hot Jam-

and modern dance’ styles, includes 18
ensemble dancers .

“It was ‘awesome. I wasn’t familiar

to see what they could handle,” she
said

Dawson’s piece, “In the Station,” is
set to Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sona-

Dawson said that her original in-

experience of  informed of a

was aware of her grief She said that it A

made‘ her aware of the importance of

simple acts of ldndness of strangers
“You don’t necessarily talk to

someone on a train or know what

know what effects even a simple ges-
ture of kindness might have on them,”
she said - ‘ .

“In the Station” uses straightfor-
ward movements as a metaphor for
these “simple gestures” The work has

been performed several times’ since

Dawson choreographed it in Septem:

Band comes out of the

basement and into rillobox

Deseree Kuzel / Staff Photographer

Josh Verbanets knows. how important it is to connect with his audience.

Important People, page 14
I’ve been  for this for a year — to ﬁnally
have the record and be able to send it out and get
an incredible response already is exciting,”‘said
Verbanets . S

' The resulting 10-track record is ﬁlled with
more singialong hooks than some bands man-
age in years Like a more—p1ayful Spoon or a less
whimsical Band of Horses, the ba.nd’s brand of
harm0ny—heaVy indie pop is fun without being
silly,  without  mucous i

And‘ after just one listen to the impossibly
catchy “Mothers Pay More” or “I Know_Every
Street,” it’ll be hard not to hum along for the
rest of the day. And though it may impede prog-
ress at each of the band members day jobs, they
have the same problem.

‘Tm a ﬁnancial analyst I’ve got a job job.
Vi/hat I do could be a career  if I wasn’t con-
stantlywalkingdown the hallto singariewmel—
ody to Matt, I could really get ahead in my job,”

said Verbanets. “Maybe Pm either immature or v

narrow—minded, but I’m too excited to get my

work done and get to work on my ban ” P
Miller, who works in Oakland with Verbanets,

couldn’t agree more '

“Hard to concentrate? THat’s an understate "

 

rnent,’7 he said.

\X71th Saturdays record release party at Bloom-
ﬁeld staple Btillobox, the band is ready, in its ﬁrst
headlining show,’ to take its music to the masses
Or, at least, the relative masses ‘

“Most of the people that come to the shows
are people in other bands or involved in music
somehow I’ve never been in a band that’s played
to a bunch of, if youwill, civilians,” said Verbanets

Bubenheimconcurred:“Everyone’stherehop-
ing you’ll see them and come to their show, too.”

Still, the fact that Pittsbu.tgh’s music scene is
saturated with fellow musicians, to Meeting of
Important People, isn’t necessarily a bad 

If anything, it seems to breed a crosscurrent
of musical ideas and bring new hands into the
forefront

“You get more exposure  in a band in
Pittsburgh — great bands don’t stay hiddenfor
very lo ” said Miller ,

Bolstered by The  Western and 
Blanc, two other recently uncovered great bands
in Pittsburgh, Saturdays show will bring these
important people out of the basement once and

~ for all

Be prepared to leave humming for days .

Blair, page 1

In short, Gibsorfs talents A on
the ﬁeld had him standing out like a

. tutbo—charged Mack truc.k in an Indy

race.
Rob Ruck, a Negro League his-
torian and senior lecturer at Pitt, said

‘the power-hitting catcher delivered

some of the longest home runs in ‘

history and may be the greatest black
hitter of all time Professional baseball
recognizes it, too. Gibson’s plaque 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame,

which he was inducted into in 1972, _

credits him with hitting “almost 800”
home runs. . '
But it wasn’t just how Gibson

- played that brought_him so much

attention, it was what he did off the
ﬁeld, -too.

In a time that blacks weren’t al— .-

lowed in the Major  Gibson

. became black Pittsburg;h’s poster boy. _
His smile and happy-go-lucky per- _’

sonality earned him respect and admi-
ration around the communitywhere

he had made his home. The talents on

the ﬁeld didn’t hurt, either.

“People can really call Josh 

hometown hero,” said Sean Gibson,

. _losh’s great-grandson. “You have an
icon in the Negro League that you can I

mentionanywhereintheUnitedStates,
and people will know about him.”

Gibson, who heads the Josh Gib-
son Foundation in the Hill District
and works closely with kids in‘ the
community, said that Josh Gibson
was the kind of guy who embraced
the idea and loved the support.

That’s one of the places that Blair »

comes in. Today, Blair is  tum-
ing into ‘a major face in the city and a

national ﬁgure After leading Schenley '

High School to’ a state title  senior

. year,Blairhadaseeminglyendlesslist

of scholarship offers. Hecould’ve gone
anywhere in the country, but stayed in
his hometown, just a ﬁve—minute walk
from the Petersen Events ‘ Center.
His decision to embrace the city and

stay close to home is the  that’s’

boosted his popularity even more.

“I think the key part is that you’Ve

. got two Aftican—American athletes, a

guy who grew up and lived on the Hill
in Dejuan, and a guy likejosh Gibson
who lived on the Hill and played for
the great baseball teams,” said Sean

Gibson. “It’s a great concept to put .

the two together.” ,

. Physically, they 4 match.

,€€ 

I wish we bad old pictures, S I

i - because we couldn't even ﬁnd

pants for him. He had to have

been about 6—foot—3.
Sean. 1 .  2
Gibson
Both show broad 9 shoul-

ders and are deﬁned by power._

And personality? Blair ﬂashes
his famous court-wide smile on
just about every occasion Wheti he

dunks, it sttetchesto= the other free- ‘

throw line \X/heni he blocks a shot,
the same  Even when a referee

‘calls him for a foul, he’ll sport a 

like he justunwrapped a new set of
Legos under the Christmas tree. ‘
“Gibson had the smile and the
personali ,” said Ruck. “It’s= this up-
beat, happy guy with an infectious

smile It’s very much a Dejuan Blair V

persona.”

Turns out that Blair grew  just
blocks from where Gibson’s Morgan
Street home stood And when Blair
was 11 and 12, he played in the Josh
Gib‘son.Littie  where he got to

_ know Sean Gibson.

“I wish we had old pictures, be-

cause we couldn’t even ﬁnd pants for ’

him,’,’ said Gibson. “He had to have

p been about 6-fo'ot—3.”

That height might be the big-
gest’ difference between the two. At
6-foot-7, Blair stands about 6 inches
taller than Gibson did; But Ruck said
that back then, it’s not  6-foot-1,

Blair mimics   Gibson off the Collilfti ,

215 pO_uncls was small. In fact, Gib-i‘

son wasone of the biggest players
around Include that with the success
at such an early age, the close connec-
tion with Pittsburgh ahd dominance

in their respectivegames, and 78 years
isn’t nearly enough to separate them.

When shown a picture of Gib-

son,,Blair showed that same evapo— _

rating smile that’s been seen by so
many opposing players and coaches
throughout the season. He embraces
the idea that Pittsburgh  city, and‘
somanyare startingto-look athim as
their basketball player.

And if he does lead Pitt further
into the NCAA Tournament, he
might" have a shot at joining Gibson
as a legend not just on the Hill,.but in
the city hecalls home « n"

“I hope I can,” said Blair. "A-I‘hat’s

why I came to Pitt”

Staﬂ Wrder
After narrow victories in the
ﬁrst two ‘rounds. of the NCAA

' Tournament, the Panthers travel to

TD Banknorth Garden in Boston
to takeon the Xavier Musketeers in
the Sweet 16. i
The No. 1-seeded Panthers and
the fourth-seeded Musketeers each
avoided early round upsets at the
hands of pesky teams such as East
Tennessee State, Oklahoma State

‘and Wisconsin.

The Panthers narrowly got past

_ Oklahoma State last Sunday, escap-

ing with an 84-76  The team
was again paced by the strong play
of its “Big Three”: Levance Fields,

_ Dejaun Blair and Sam Young.

“I really feel conﬁdent in my

team this year to get past the Sweet ‘

16,” said sophomore guard and

forward Gilbert Brown. “We’re '

well prepared, the players we have

— -on the team are more athletic, and

we’re a better rebounding team
than before.”

Amain reason for Pitt’s success
has also been the play of guard
Fields. And speaking of point
guard play at Pitt, Xavier coach
Sean Miller is about as familiar as
they come with the Panthers.

1 Playing at the Fitzgerald Field
House. from 1988-92, Miller was

. the Big East freshman of the year

and led Pitt to the NCAA Tourna-
ment three tim'es.“Miller ‘has since
moved on into-coaching and has
already left his mark on another

- program, Xavier, through only his '

ﬁfth season. .

After leading them‘ to the Elite
Eight last season and losing several
key players from that team, Miller
and the Musketeers reloaded this
season.

. v This year’s team is _led by senior,
forwards B._]. Raymond and C].

Anderson at 14.1 and 1f) points per
game, respectively, while junior for-_

ward Derrick Brown contributes
nearly 14 a game, as well.

These players highlight a deep
roster that is full of athletic and ex-
plosive players who should give the,
Panthers frontline a challenge ‘

“They’re real tall and athletic
and they play a different style of
pace,” said Fields. .

The Musketeers, regular season

champions out of the Atlantic 10.. ~

for the third straight‘ year, come-
into this game after having defeated

Portland State, 77-59, and W/iscon—_ '

sin by a score of 60-49.

-While the Panthers have already A

gone down in‘ the history books
this season, garnering the pro-
gram’s ﬁrst ever No. 1 ranking and
No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, they know there is still more
history to be made.

“Now that I have the opportu-*'
nity to [get past the Sweet 16],” said ‘

Young, “we don’t want to let that
opportunity slip past us.”

NCAA Tournament «

Breaking down

by Kyle Craig I
Staff Writer

\X71th the ﬁrst weekend of March Madness

ﬁnished, many are left to lament their busted A

bracket and ‘wonder why theyfve  wasted

another ﬁve bucks in a tournament pool \Wake_

Forest all the way? Maybe next year.

So far, boxing brackets have been rewarded.’

For theﬁrst time in NCAA Tournament history,
all No. l, No. 2 and No. 3 seeds have advanced
to the Sweet 16. This feat surely beneﬁts the’
fourth—grade boys who are now leading their fa-

" ther’s ofﬁcepool.

\While the success’ of the top-seeded squads
might be disappointing for Cinderella—lovers, it
certainly provides a fair share of marquee match-
ups for Thursday and Friday. Here’s a preview of

_ some big Sweet 16 rnatchups and a look at the

players that should make a difference.’ '

theElite Eight for the second time in his tenure

_ For Pitt, the table is set for the program to. '
' ﬁnally get over the hump. Xavier, an Atlantic-'10

team-that struggled near the “end of ‘the regular
season, gives Pitt its best opportunity to ﬁnally
advance past the Sweet -16. It is absolutely crucial
that the Panthers don’t think ahead to a possible
game against Duke or Villanova, because if they
do, they’ll be going home 

No. 2 Duke vs. No. 3 Villanova, Thursday '

9:57. p.m.
Key Players

Anyonehwho has taken a peek at ESPN’ dur-
ing college basketball season is probably familiar

with Duke junior Gerald Henderson. 

the Blue  iniregular season scoring is no

small feat, considering Henderson did it while A

playing alongside proliﬁc scorers like Kyle Sin-
gler and Jon Scheyer. ' .

The Storyline

The honeymoon is ﬁnally over for Vrllanova,
as it’1l actually have to leave the city of Philadel-
phia in order to play its third game of the Tour-
nament After suffering a scare against American
University, the VVldcats showed they weren’t in-
timidated of traditional powerhouses — stomp
ing UCLA by 20 points i‘

Villanova lacks the big man to challenge
Duke inside the paint, so this game might come
down to perimeter shooting. The team that con-
trols the pace of the contest and is able to hit
shots in transition will win

The West (Glendale, AZ):

No. 1‘ Connecticut vs No. 5 Purdue, Thurs-
day 7:07 p.m.

Key Players

Despite being the co—Big East Player of the
Year, Connecticut’s Hasheem Thabeet, was a
non—factor in the second round of the Tourna-
ment. Forward Jeff Adrien and guard A]. Price
picked up the slack with impressive perfor-
mances in the first two rounds Adrien gives the
Huskies an athletic, powerful scorer, while Price
provides scoring ability from beyond the arc

Purdue was able to squeak by \X/ashington
largely thanks to the play of Jajuanjohnson. The
6—foot—1O forward has been admirably efficient
during the Tournament, scoring 36 points in two
games and shooting 43 percent from the ﬁeld It
will be up to Johnson and his teammate Robbie
Hurnrnel to match ,Connecticut’s physical pres-
ence on the inside. -

The Storyline:

The Huskies have impressed the competi-
tion  their dominance during the ﬁrst week~
end of the Tournament. Connecticut displayed
why it was  a No 1 seed and isn’t showing
any  of slowing down. If Thabeet can re-
turn to "his regular form, Purdue might ﬁnd itself
joining the formidable group of Big Ten teams
eliminated from the Tournament

No. 2 Memphis vs Na 3 Missouri, Thursday
9:37 pm. '

Key Players

Memphis has four players averaging double
digits in scoring, but its most dynamic player has
to be true freshman Tyreke Evans In the first
two Tournament games, Evans has 34 points
and 10 assists Although Evans has struggled
shooting 3—pointers throughout the year, he is
dangerous when  things happen off the
dribble and is aggressive when Memphis is on a
fast break , P

For Missouri, senior Leo Lyons is getting
hot at the right time. Against Marquette, Lyons
racked up 18 points, and .against Cornell he
scored 23. Lyons and fellow senior DaMarre
Carroll will need to keep their team in the game
when Memphis pushes the tempo. -

The Storyline:

. One  this game will settle is which team
is the best M-something Tigers in the nation. But
that’s not the only reason to watch this game, as
both Missouri and Memphis tout high—octane
offenses -

Both teams” like to run up and -down the
court and attack the basket in transition. This is
a contest for people who enjoy fast breaks The

'ﬁrstteamtofallbehindthepaceofthe_game

will be waving goodbye to a prospective trip to
Detroit. ’
