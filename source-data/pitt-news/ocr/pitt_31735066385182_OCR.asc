‘Middle

East crisis

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

Two’ conflicting viewpoints
held by American Jews about the
establishment of a Palestinian

J . state in the Middle East were ar-

gued at a United Jewish Federa-
tion‘ debate last night at CMU.

Fred Schechter,_ Israeli Shal-
iach, moderated the debate be-
tween Pitt Professor Michael
Zigmund and CMU Professor
Nechemia Chigier, both of whom
are interested in the preservation
of Israel as an autonomous
nation.  -.

”I am Jewish, and I have spent
sometime in Israel,’’ said Zig-
mund. ’’I am interested in the sur-
vival of Israel as a nation, on one
hand, and I’m interested in a just
and stable solution between Jews
and Arabs on the'oth.er.”

Zigmund said he is displeased
with the Israeli government's
refusal to negotiate with the
Palestinians over the creation of
a new Arab state.

He said the Palestinians would
be pleased to hold an election at
any time and elect representation

‘other than the Palestinian Liber-
ation Organization to negotiate
with the Israelis.

Posvar commends UHC at Senate

Approximately 35 people at-
tended the annual fall meeting of
the university Senate yesterday to
hear reports from Senate leaders
on the status of the university.

The university Senate is com-
prised of full—time faculty, tenured
part-time faculty, full—time librar-
ians, university President Wesley
Posvar, deans of all the schools

within the university and students
selected by various student
groups.

The university president also
appoints I2 administrators to the
Senate.

University Senate President
Herbert A. Chesler suggested that
primary interests of the Senate
this academic year will include
determining how Pitt will be af-
fected by the removal of the man-
datory retirement age for faculty

members scheduled to take effect
in 1994.

Chesler said further study of af-
firmative action policies and
procedures and the development
of a strategy to protect faculty
salaries from the reductions in
purchasing power caused by in-
flation are other areas of concern
for the Senate. .

University Senate Vice Presi-
dent Robert J. Ertel reported that
the Senate Council had discussed

Under the SGB elections code,
a candidate who fails to meet the
established deadline may still

Problems with the cafeteria sys-
tem, the Student Government
Board elections and SGB parl-
iamentary procedure were the is-
sues addressed at last night's SGB
meeting. ,

Improvement of cafeteria food '

quality and line delays is current-
ly being examined by SGB mem-
ber Curt Toll. _ ‘
Toll met with Housing Direc-
tor, Donovan Hughes and Peter
Rix, the general manager of the
Dining and Kitchen Administra-
tion. They discussed different al-
legations involving the cafeterias.
Concerning food quality, Toll
said that Hughes and Rix were
very disturbed about the poor
condition of the meats, and they
vowed to examine this further.

Students are encouraged to ’

register complaints with any one
of the four managers who are
present in the cafeterias at all
times. The managers wear a tie or
identification badge to be
recognized. ’

Other concerns or complaints

can be reported to the adminis-
tration office located on the Tow-
er C side of the cafeteria. ’
. According to Toll, long cafeter-
ia lines have become a much big-
ger problem this year. Also
according to Toll, Rix was very
disturbed regarding the results of
a new demographic study which
shows that 21 -percent of the stu-
dents utilizing the cafeteria eat
lunch between 12 and 12:15
p.m.
Toll explained that some ideas
to remedy this, besides eating at
a different time, include taking
the salad bar off the line or begin-
ning a “seconds” line.

Toll will be joining the Towers’
Food Service Committee to help
out.

In other business, SGB Presi-
dent Craig Jackson spoke with
Jinx Walton, of the Computer In-
formation Systems, on the
progress of the Computer Leasing
Program, designed to enable stu-
dents to lease computers. Jackson
said it appears that all the ad-
ministration offices are in favor of
this program; however, they lack
the funds to implement it.

Walton stated that lack of funds
is the only problem now facing
such a plan.

Jackson also met with Tara

Former sheriff arraigned for child molestation,

PITTSBURGH (AP) — A form-
er Somerset County sheriff, who
pleaded guilty three years ago to
pressuring six prisoners to have
sex with him, was arraigned
Wednesday on charges that he
took a 13-year-old boy ‘to an
Ohio hotel for sex.

Guy H. Davis, 45, of Somerset,
was arrested by FBI agents on
charges he transported the boy
from Mount Pleasant, West-
moreland County, to Willough-
by, Ohio, "with the intent [to]
engage in sexual activity."

U.S. Magistrate Robert C.
Mitchell ordered Davis held in
the Allegheny County Jail pend-
ing a preliminary detention hear-
ing Friday, said a clerk in
Mitchell's office who declined to
give his name.

The FBI said the victim told
Mount Pleasant police about a
trip he took with Davis on Sept.
28 and 29. The victim said he
met Davis at a Mount Pleasant
pet store and Davis asked him to
come on a business trip to Ohio,
according to authorities.

Davis has been a salesman
with a pet—food supply firm in

Wycliffe, Ohio, authorities said.

FBI spokesman Jeff Kimball
said Davis was placed in the
Somerset County Jail on Monday
for violating his parole.

Casey endorses
unemployment bill

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Gov.
Robert P. Casey endorsed legis-

The unemployment fund,
which pays benefits to jobless
workers, slipped into debt in the
19705 with the collapse of the
steel industry and the onset of a
recession. With the fund under
intense pressure, the state bor-
rowed liberally from the federal
government to cover benefit pay-
ments, and the debt ballooned to
$2.7 billion in 1984.

The bill, signed by Casey, will

The Panhellenic and lnterfrater-
nity Councils are sponsoring the
Alcohol Awareness Program, Our
Choice, in the William Pitt Union
tonight beginning at 6 p.m.,

Our Choice stands for "Our
Concerns Harboring Over In-
creased Campus Education.”

The main speaker at the event
will be Dr. Tom Goodhale, edi-
tor of Alcohol and the College
Student. He will be speaking on
”Drinking Responsibility” at 7:30
p.m.

”Michelle Jedlica, Panhellenic
president, and I had the idea of
our group since March 3, last
year. It's been in the making for
the last eight months,” said

Chuck Farinella, IFC president.

”This program is aimed
towards campus education,”
Farinella said. ”These programs
aren't just geared for Greeks but
for the individual students in
general.”

Farinella added, ”This is a
seed. I see Our Choice as a vehi-
cle of education for the campus‘
as well as Greek education.”

According to Marge Lyons, Stu-
dent Health educator, the Health
Education Office was invited by
the IFC to perform demonstra-
tions before the Alcohol Aware-
ness presentations begin.

The Health Education Office
will be demonstrating how the
breathalizer works. Health edu-
cators will be discussing how im- .
pairment occurs in a person

when one begins to consume
alcohol.

Lyons said the Campus Police
will be providing information on
underage drinking laws.

”Campus police will be walk-
ing students through the process
as if they were pulled over for
drinking [while driving]," said
Lyons.

Students will be informed of
the testings that Campus Police
regulate, such as walking a
straight line.

The Our Choice program be-
gins at 6 p.m. for the Alcohol
Awareness Exhibit in the WPU
Ballroom. ‘

The Resident Student Associa-

tion and other campus organiza-

tions will pass items out such as
candy, keychains and buttons.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The
number of AIDS cases in the
eight—county Philadelphia area
will almost triple, to at least
2,990, in 1992, at a cost to the
health care system of $160
million to $240 million a year,
according to a study by the
Philadelphia Commission on
AIDS.

The study also found that
the Medicaid system in Penn-
sylvania presented major
problems for AIDS patients
and that it is "virtually impos-
sible” for people in Pennsyl-
vania afflicted with the deadly
virus to obtain nursing home
care.

The study was written by
Peat Marwick Main Co., at a
cost of $90,000 for the
Philadelphia Commission on
AIDS. The commission, fund-
ed by the Pew Charitable

Trust, was set up to study all
aspects of the AIDS epidemic
in the Philadelphia area.

”The AIDS problem is seri-
ous. It should be treated seri-
ously, and based on numbers
I will show you, it appears to
us that it will get worse before
it gets better,” Gerald Katz, a
Peat Marwick partner, said as
the study was released at a
news conference Tuesday.

”One has to be both im-
pressed and dismayed with
the numbers,” Katz said.

The study projects that the
current number of AIDS cases
in the eight—county region
[I ,093] will increase to 2,990
in 1992. Peat Marwick said its
estimates were 10 percent to
20 percent higher than earlier
projections developed by the
national Centers for Disease
Control.

Number of AIDS cases rises

The study recommended
that the state rethink policies
for Medicaid and use its
licensing powers to create
more nursing home beds for
AIDS patients.

It also recommended:

Adult day care should be
provided for people with Ac-
quired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome who need care in a
non-hospital setting.

One or more dental clinics
should be set up for AIDS pa-
tients, to address one of the
most serious problems they
face.

All hospitals in the region
should appoint AIDS co-

By Linda Micco

For The Pitt News

For the past two decades, U.S.
Rep. Joseph M. Gaydos has been
attempting to increase govern-
mental awareness of the infiltra-
tion of American businesses by
foreigners. In a recent statement,
Gaydos said that foreign owner-
ship of American assets has tri-

- pled over the past seven years to

$1.5 trillion.

”We seem to be marching
backwards to a time when the
[United States] was nothing but a
colony with production and eco-
nomic power and control in the
hands of foreign interests,” said
Gaydos.

Congress is now beginning to

vital raw materials and natural
resources. On Oct. 6, 1988, the
bill which Gaydos had proposed
passed in the House with a vote
of 250 to 170.

When this bill becomes a law,
foreign nationals who own more
than 5 percent of an American
business that is worth more than
$5 million or that grosses more
than $10 million in annual sales
will be forced to identify and
itemize their holdings to the Fed-
eral Commerce Commission.

Foreigners who hold invest-
ments in American businesses or
property worth more than $20
million will also be required to
report their holdings to the Fed-
eral Commerce Commission
once this bill is enacted by the
government.

The final edict of this legislation
proposed by Congressman Gay-
dos will force corporations
owned by foreigners to provide
extensive profit sheets and to dis-
close the identities of its officers
and directors.

Gaydos said that this legislation
is critical because the govern-
ment currently lacks the basic
data necessary to analyze the ef-
fects of foreign ownership of
domestic assets on the nation’s
economic independence and na-
tional security.

The congressman has said that
he understands the reasoning of
those who see foreign investment
in the United States as a source
of revenue and appreciates what
a job in a foreign-owned plant
means to a worker who might,
otherwise be unemployed. ll 

However, Gaydos said/‘I have
deep misgivings about foreign
domination over American wor-
kers. A foreigner can hire and fire
at will, close or relocate a plant,
take his profit and run, leaving
behind unemployment, frustra-
tion and chaos. Is that good for
the American worker?”

Intimidation is not

civil disobedience Will‘ P

‘After spending 2‘/2 years behind bars, anti-abortion ac-
tivist Joan Andrews was released on Tuesday from Alleghe-

ny County Jail.

Andrews, a member of the radical anti‘-abortion group
Operation Rescue, was arrested and jailed for entering an
abortion clinic and attempting to damage a suction
machine. She vowed to continue ”rescuing” unborn chil-

dren from abortions.

Operation Rescue was issued a restraining order to keep
its members from blocking the entrance or protesting on
the property of abortion clinics.

Andrew's actions bring up some questions about the
choice of abortion and what is the proper way to protest
the stance of the law. Many of the pro-life supporters feel
strongly about the issue, Andrews obviously being one
of them, and feelthat they are ”rescuing” children.

By the book, it is simple. Andrews broke a law; she
should be punished. The law she broke had nothing to

do with abortion.

As an attempt at civil disobedience, however, Andrews’
move to protest abortion was a poor one. Violent action,
such as trespassing and attempted destruction of property,

is wrong. Other ”radica|s”

have bombed clinics and

harassed people for similar reasons.

Theseattempts on the part of Operation Rescue to in-
timidate people into accepting their beliefs is abhorrent.
Andrews claims to be ”rescuing”,babies. Her wording is
a bit off. What she is actually doing is trying to intimidate
women from using the rights they have by law, thereby
forcing an unwanted baby on them, while she goes on

to harass others.

clothes even after a firm, personal
vow to stop. Who would’ve
guessed the first lady of the Unit-
ed States of America (land of the
very affordable K-Mart) didn't
even have a decent dinner dress
of her own?

Even though she wasn't re-
quired under the Ethics in
Government Act to report her
”loans,” she promised. And
you'd think that if the first lady
made a promise, she'd stick to it,
by gum.

We would have understood
her borrowing habits and not
complained if she would have
just told us some of her hubby's
cutbacks to help lower the na-
tional deficit were made in her
wardrobe allowance, because,
gosh, we do want her to look
good, seeing how she does

represent our country and all. ‘But
she must have undergone some
severe internal. conflict that result-
ed in her decision to quit borrow-
ing. But I don't understand why
you kept on borrowing after you

promised, Nancy.

So while fancy Nancy was daz-
zling us all in her Bill Blass gowns
and Galanos outfits, she was all
along betraying us, and she knew
it. But most of all, Nancy, you
were betraying yourself. I sure
hope you can live with yourself.

Since she apparently feverish-
ly advocates such borrowing,
maybe she wouldn't mind loan-
ing out some of her clothes.

Way back in 1982, she said she
was borrowing the clothing to
help the fashion industry, but her
efforts were “misunderstood.”

My wife and I were eating din-
ner in the kitchen last Wednes-
day evening and watching Peter
Jennings on ABC news.

I didn't hear his exact words,‘

but Peter indicated that, on the

basis of a nationwide poll, ABC

had given the election to George
Bush.

”Is that it?” my wife said. ’’Is
it over?”

”Dukakis is a dead fish,” I
rep I i ed.

”But Election Day isn't until
Nov. 8. How could they an-
nounce the results in October?”

”One guy with a clipboard
spoke to 10,000 people, and
based on those results, Bush has
all rights to the White House ten-
nis court.”

She seemed shaken. ”If the
ABC poll is correct, why should
anyone bother to vote?”

”You don't have to if you don't
want to,” I told her. ”But ballot-
ing in this country is a tradition.
We don’t do it for ourselves, we
do it for the children.”

"You’re not taking this serious-
ly. That poll just took my ballot
away from’me. Why should I go
out and pull the lever if I can’t
make a difference?”

"Look, it had to come to this
sooner or later,” I told her.
”Remember the election nights
when they used to concede states
to the presidential candidates by
8 .m.? Now the technique is so

Usually, the word ”heIp” implies
some degree of sacrifice on the
part of the helper. What a
sacrifice it must have been for her
to wear gowns worth thousands
of dollars and not have to pay for
them.

And what a threat this human
billboard for petite designer
clothing must have posed to high
fashion models such as Paulina
and Christina Crawford.

What's most important,
though, is that we, the public,
were informed of Nancy's beach.

‘ Nancy's photo appeared three -
, count ‘em — three times on the

front page of The Washington
Post this Tuesday.

She has accomplished the cre-
ation of a media event that rivals
Imelda ”two-thousand—left-feet"
Marcos.

I'm really disappointed that
Nancy couldn't even own up to
it herself. You're a big girl Nan-
cy, why not? No, you had to get

retined that they can give you the
results in October. It wouldn't
surprise me if the next time
around, they declare the winner
on the Fourth of July. I am glad
it's over. Bush was starting to turn
into a nice gm’ "

"Are they going to give up
campaigning?” she asked me.

’’I imagine so. There's no sense
spending all that time and money
when the results are poll-
ordained.”

”There is something fishy
about this wholething. Both sides
are urging their troops on, the
dirty commercials have just been
released, and the hecklers are
stretched out in the streets. How
can anyone declare the election
is over?"

"You can't fight computers.
They not only know who lost but
why he lost. Once you crunch
the numbers, there is nothing left
to do but put your hand on the
ChiefJustice’s Bible and solemn-
ly swear.”

"You sound happy that they've
announced who next President is
going to be.” .

"I'm not happy about it —— I'm
just realistic. If we can be in-
formed a month in advance who
won, the time will come when

you.” Bet you had one of your
friends write your absentee ex-
cuses from school, too.

I would have liked to have a
chance to talk to Nancy's mom,
seeing as Nancy could use some
scolding. Her c|othes—borrowing
habit probably started early in
life. It probably began as a sim-
ple, ”Can I borrow that scarf?” to
a junior high girl friend.

In senior high, she probably
started raiding mom's closet.
”This will make me look sooo
grown up.” Then, as an actress,
she probably borrowed from her
fellow Hollywood starlets. ”That
ruby necklace sure would look
nice with my black cashmere,”
she'd say.

Another distressing part of this
whole, sordid ordeal is that Nan-
cy Reagan is basically a politi-
cian. Therefore, she has betrayed
politicians nationwide by break-
ing the one rule politicians are

olls, why hold elections?

we don't have to have an election
at all. We'll go out on to the side-
walk, tap someone on the shoul-
der, and the next day we'll have
a new Cipper in the Oval
Office.”

”I thought we were going to
have an election night party," she
said.

”VVe were,” I replied, ”but I
didn't know they would an-
nounce the winner tonight. That's
the only part about jumping the
gun I don't like. The pollsters
never give you enough time to
stocI< u on s9I<_:I guts."

”WeIl, what shall we do on
Nov. 8 if there is no suspense?”

“Maybe the candidates will

have another debate just to kill .

time. Besides, there is a lot more
to election night than choosing a
President. You get to see the fa-
milies of the winners and losers.
The political experts tell us what
the losers did wrong, and maybe
Dan Quayle will finally reveal
what his grades were in school.”

My wife said, ”The people I
feel most sorry for are those who
live in California. In the East we
now know who our next Presi-
dent is, but they have to wait
three more hours before some-
body out West is permitted to
give them the word."

By Jessica Coville
Staff Writer

New York's They Might Be Gi-
ants, named Best Rock Band on
an independent label at the 1988
New York Music Awards, have
released their second album, Lin-
coln, on the Bar/None label.

Their first album, entitled They
Might Be Giants, elicited rave
reviews and Lincoln has now sur-
passed those.

The first album contained 19
songs with genres from art pop to
country to polka. England's Melo-
dy Maker maintained, ”they have
a strong undercurrent of lyric seri-
ousness to otherwise witty, word-
intensive tunesmithing.”

The band includes: John Flans-
burgh (the one with glasses) and
John Linnell (the other one). Hav-
ingmet in grammar school in the
suburbs outside of Boston, Lin-
nell and Flansburgh separated for
a number of years, each pursuing
his own path in. the music field.
The two didn't get together mu-
sically until they both moved into
the same Brooklyn apartment
building on the same day.

Discovering that they had writ-
ten over 300 songs combined,
they decided to institute their
Dial—a—Song service. This enabled
their fans to call and hear a new
tune every day or so.

The team shares the songwrit-
ing duties (Flansburgh plays gui-
tar and Linnell plays accordion
and sax live, to the accompani-
ment of prerecorded tracks), and
they agree that the idea behind
TMBG is ”speaking with one
voice.” Flansburgh said, ”We’re
not the most experimental rock
band in the world, but I think it's
unusual that we get people into
it, considering how far off the
beaten track we really are.

”The way we approach tech-
nology is sort of a second-
generation use of synthesized
music. Our music is completely
based in the present, not in some
high-tech vision of the future.”

When speaking of influences,
Linnell talks of the Beatles mak-
ing a good foundation for the
band and adds, ”For myself, I
liked mostly The Ramones and
Elvis Costello. Costello seemed
like a guy you could base a
whole music theory on.”

Lincoln is not so much a depar-
ture as a natural continuation for
the Giants. Flansburgh said, ”The
big difference with Lincolnlis that
we've done hundreds of shows
since that first record, so as in-
strumentalists, vocal performers
and songwriters, we’re just that
much more developed.

’’I think we've also learned that
our arrangements might actually
be less fussy than they used to be.
We tend to leave the kitchen sink
in the kitchen now.”

The Giants are currently plan-
ning a U.S. and European tour in
support of Lincoln, and the future
looks limitless. Flansburgh states
the TMBG motto: ”Have a good
time, all the time.”

Ducts. Electrical Wiring. l\/lar-
ble slabs.

For the uninitiated, a first—time
visit to the l\/letropol is nothing
short of a small shock. A
Confetti-ite might think he's in
the middle of an almost-
constructed building, what with
the abundance of steel fence
and I-beams blatantly not co-
vered up with walls; The
l\/letropol smacks of tid—bits
seemingly stolen from the set of
Terry Gilliam's l‘/385 film, Brazil.

”l've never seen Brazil,
although lots of people tell me
they think l\/letropol is styled af-
ter it," said Robin Fernandez,
oresident of the club. "l grew up
here; raw steel was the image
I had of this town. It was also a

-‘way to save cost while trying to

/I

build something artistic.

Selling Pittsburgh entrepeneurs
on the idea of a club with ”ar-
tistic integrity," as Fernandez
calls it, was something close to
impossible. Fernandez was con-
tinually told that his idea of a
club wouldn't wash well in Pitts-
burgh and that Pittsburghers
were just too closed-minded for
rheidea.

”People initially supported the
idea, but when it came time for
them to sign a check, they sud-
denly had to buy a house or
take a three-week vacation and
had to decline,” Fernandez said
without hiding his sarcasm.

Lack of enthusiasm from Pitts-
burgh sent Fernandez fishing
elsewhere for the needed capi-
tal: namely Chicago. Fernandez
rounded up l8 investors from
Chicago who had never seen
anything about the /\/letropol ex-
cept a letter soliciting monetary
backers. Money in hand, Fer-
nandez went ahead and built his
Club.

"l wanted to fill a void in the
market here. There was a whole
group of people who had no
place to go; there was no night-
club to satisfy some tastes," Fer-
nandez said of his intentions.
”Other clubs never change any-
thing and always have the same
types of people. l wanted a
place where everyone could go
and feel comfortable.

”People were frightened of
the change, at first, but now
they're starting to come
around."

Fernandez is careful to avoid
having the l\/letropol branded as
anything other than a "venue."
He doesn't want the club to be-
come associated with one sort
of music type or crowd of
people.

"We are not a disco," he
said emphatically, ”we are a
venue. We try to sponsor art ex-
hibitions, fashion shows and
concerts as well. This is sup-
posed to be a place where
businessmen, progressives, gays
and yuppies can all stand stand
around together and feel at
ease. That's what we're all
about"

TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

A sponge is a hardy organism
that can absorbs much moisture,
or as Chris Theoret put it, ”some—
one who freeloads off of his
parents.”

Theoret is the lead singer of the
Pittsburgh band, the Sponges,
and he confided that the latter
definition is where his band's
name originated.

’’I started the band when I was
just in high school, and it [the
band’s name] came from “spong-
ing off of our parents,’ ” he said.

Six years after its conception,
The Sponges are still going
strong. The line—up has changed
a lot during the years and their
potential has developed over
time, but the premise behind the
band is still thesame —— to create
and perform music with a catchy,
”commercialized” beat.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 20, I988

Cleaning up local music

The Sponges, in addition to
founding member Theoret, or
”The Rat” as he jokingly calls
himself, consist of: Dan Osborne

(guitar), Kurt Lorence (bass), Bill.

Ferchak (keyboards and sax),
John Wilson (drums) and Lisa
Klein (backing vocals).

Getting into the mind of a
Sponge is a difficult task. These
guys are young, spirited perform-
ers who joke around incessantly
about everything —- including in-
terviews. No one will ever accuse
them of taking themselves too
seriously.

But deep down, they take their
music seriously. After proclaim-
ing that ”Barry Manilow writes
the songs,” Theoret admitted that
he is the main songwriter as far
as lyrics go and that he usually
writes about relationships and
personal experiences that are
probably nothing like those of
Barry Manilow.

As for writing the melodies,
that is a group effort. Someone
may come up with an original
idea, but everyone tries to ex-
pand on it.

The current group of Sponges
is the tightest ever, both musical-
ly and friendship-wise. According
to Lorence, the band members
are all close friends and they all
work together well. This type of
relationship can only help to
streghthen their music.

Each member of-the Sponges is
a talented musician in his own
right and each one has his partic-
ular influence. Jazz, pop and rock
all have found a place in The
Sponges’ music. Theoret made a
point of mentioning Lorence’s
bass playing, citing that his
”funky” style is the backbone, if
not the inspiration, of the music.

An important characteristic of
a Sponge is his laziness, joked
Wilson, one of the newest mem-
bers of the group. In reality,
though, The Sponges are any-
thing but sluggish or lazy when
it comes to their music. In addi-
tion to the many years of live per-
formances in the Pittsburgh area,

The Sponges recently spent some
time performing in clubs through-
out New York City.

They also have two local
recordings under their collective
belt. Both their EP, referred to as
”The Blue Tape”, and their cas-
single sold well. Local airplay on
WPTS has helped the band as
well. Work on their latest project,
which was recorded in Florida, is
being finished and, with any luck,
will be released in December.

The Sponges have been criti-
cized for sounding too ”commer-
cial” in the past, but Theoret
questions that argument.

”We play original pop music.
That’s what makes us different
from other pop bands. Not many
other bands can play two hours
of their own stuff. Our musical
style just happens to be catchy
and accessible. There's nothing
wrong with a pop or commercial
style, especially when we are do-
ing all original material,” Theoret
explained.

Tina Scaglion, manager of the
band, hesitates to describe The
Sponges as a ”glamor” pop band,
but does feel that they are more
mainstream or commercial than
most other area bands. There is
no denying that The Sponges pos-
sess a smooth, frothy sound and
a definite pop flair.

”We joke about wanting air-
play on B-94, but realistically, our
sound sort of fits their format,”
Scaglion said.

When The Sponges aren't busy
terrorizing reporters or the report-
ers’ cats (OK, they didn't terrorize
me, but they did scare Tiger),
they're more than likely working
on their music. If you're interest-

‘ed in a good time dancing to

some light, catchy tunes, check
out The Sponges. You'll have the
chance this Friday night when
they play at Graffiti with
Christopher Truth and Cleve-
land's Exotic Birds.

SITHEENS

The Smithereens: Mike Mesaros, Pat DiNizio, Jim Babjek, Dennis Diken

By Tim Azinger

Assistant Showcase Editor

Base roots of '60s rock, com-
bined with a nuance ofdistinctly
original pop, vividly portray the
Smithereens’ musical smartness.

Pat DiNizio (vocals), Jim Bab-
jek (guitar), Mike Mesaros (bass),
and Dennis Diken (drums) com-
pose this New York quartet.

The group officially came
together in March of 1980 and

" released their first EP, Girls About

Town, only six months later.

This EP was followed by a sec-
ond, Beauty & Sadness, which
was released in June, 1983.

Both EPs were self—produced
and released on D—Tone records,-
the band’s own label.

The Smithereens spent time
touring Europe, and after their
return to the United States, they
were signed to Enigma Records in
October of 1985.

Their first Enigma-produced LP,
Especially for You, received gran-

. diose praise and made the Top

100 LPs of T987 in Billboard
magazine.

Especially for You contained
the infamous singles “Blood and
Roses” and ”Behind the Wall of
Sleep” and captured Best Debut
LP in the NYC Music Awards.

The Smithereens spent over 18
months promoting Especially for
You on a tour that encompassed
the United States, Canada and
headline shows all over Europe.

It is rumored that DiNizio craft-
ed the Smithereens’ most recent
release, Green Thoughts, in a
scant four weeks. Even more im—
pressive is the fact that the album
was recorded and mixed in only
'16 (lays.

The frenzied production of

and gives you the sense that their
earlier endeavors have helped
them mature and come together
musically.

The songs on Green Thoughts
still contain the rigorous realities
of love and romance, disguised
under a blanket of brisk, alluring
musical arrangements, the same
trait that received attention and
captured fans on their earlier
works.

”Only a Memory” and ”House
We Used to Live In” are proba-
bly the album’s best—known
songs, due to the amount of air-
play they received and their
rough, bouncy, upbeat style.

”Especially for You” contains
a riveting saxophone deluge from

Shorter says he's not another Lane

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

It's only Oct. 20, but basketball
season is already starting to kick
into full gear. Pitt coach Paul
Evans’ team is no exception, as
they have been working out at
Fitzgerald Field House for the
past five days.

Watching the guards practice,
you might think there is no differ-

     

ence between this team and last
year's 25-8 squad that was elimi-
nated from the NCAA Tourna-
ment with an 80-74
second—round overtime loss to
Vanderbilt.

But sneak a peek at the big men
as they're running the fast break
and hitting the glass. Can’t seem
to find that No. 32 guy, or 34, for
that matter.

Even that No. 33_, "Meech/,’ _

isn't around.

For the first time in four years,
center Charles Smith and swing-
man Demetreus Care will not be
in the lineup; for the first time in
three years forward Jerome Lane
will not be banging the boards.

This makes for an entirely
different frontcourt for the season-
opener Nov. 26 against Oklaho-

ma State, the first of six consecu-

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 20, l988

‘ Continued from page 14
tive‘ home games.

Taking over at the inside spots
will be the expected starting trio
of Brian Shorter, Bobby Martin
and Rod Brookin.

Martin and Brookin have faced
Big East competition before;
Shorter has not, and he has some-
thing to prove.

’’I’m ready to go. I've been
working out all off-season, and I
know that they're going to be de-
pending on me to do some
things,” the 6-foot-7, 235-pound
sophomore said.

Shorter, a highly recruited for-
ward who transferred from
Philadelphia Simon Gratz to Oak
Hill Academy in Virginia, sat out
last season due to Proposition 48.

Now that he's back, he'll do
whatever it takes to see the play-
ing time he missed in 1987.

’’I’m just going to do what the
coach wants me do,” said Short-
er, who was 383 points shy of
Wilt Chamberlain's city scoring
record before making the move
to the private academy.

Inevitable comparisons to
Lane, the 1986-87 national re-
bounding champion, have haunt-
ed Shorter since he enrolled at

‘ Pitt. And why not? Shorter’s re-

bounding prowess is well
documented: 13 boards, 24
points per game as a senior; 15.8
rebounds, 31.6 ppg and 2.6
blocked shots per game as a
junior.

But Shorter doesn't like being
compared to Lane, nor does he
want the characteristics of this
team to-rest on the history of
Smith and Gore.

”’They’re gone, and we can't do
anything about that.”

Instead, he stresses the positive
points of this year's team.

”Most of the players on this
team all came in together as
freshmen,” Shorter said,.referring
to sophomores Sean Miller, Bob-
by Martin, Darelle Porter and Ja-
son Matthews.

”We’re very familar with each

other; we all know each other,” .

he said.

Shorter also gave a favorable
nod to Gilbert Johnson, a 6-8,
225-pound transfer from Lees-
McRae Junior College in North
Carolina. A

”He’ll be the big guy that will
come in and take up space and
get the boards,” Shorter said.

Although the loss of Smith,
Lane and Gore will be hard to
swallow, Johnson is confident
that they will not be missed as
sorely as some might think.

”Shorter, Mas [Steve Maslek],
Big Bob [Martin] and I can cover
pretty well,” said Johnson, who,
with his flattop haircut might be
mistaken for West Virginia's Chris
Brooks.

But Johnson knows there is a
potential problem there.

”We just don't have a lot of big
men,” he said.

Martin and Maslek rate as the
tallest members of the team at
6-9, with Johnson and Shorter fol-
lowing just behind.

But in a league that sports a
man 6-10 or over on nearly ev-
ery roster, that may not be
enough.

”|fy we play hard, if we play
together, we shouldn't have too
much trouble,” Johnson said.

depleted — but Middie coach El-
liot Uzelac has been pleased with
his team's offensive production,
which amounts to 387.5 yards
per game, 286.7 yards on the
ground via the wishbone.

”Our offense is better than last
year — we're more productive
with it —- but we still aren't real-
ly consistent with some of the
things we are doing. 4

”I honestly believe if we didn't
have some of the injuries, we'd
even be better yet,” Uzelac said.

The Navy offense starts with
quarterback Alton Grizzard, who
leads the Midshipmen with 395
yards and five touchdowns on the

ground. Backup QB Gary McIn-
tosh has run for 227 yards and
four touchdowns.

Halfbacks Luther Archer and
James Bradley have combined for
588 yards and four touchdowns,
while fullbacks Bert Pangrazio
and Deric Sims have churned a
total of 262 yards and two
touchdowns.

Uzelac has taken advantage of
14 groundmen enroute to 1,720
yards and 15 touchdowns.

Obviously, Navy is a run-

oriented team, and’ Grizzard’s
343 yards passing and only two
touchdowns, compared to Dick-
erson’s 11,003 yards and seven

touchdowns, certainly doesn't
hide that fact.

But Pitt features a high-geared
ground game of its own, casting
freshman tailback Curvin
Richards, who has rushed for 523

yards and four touchdowns in six.

games, in the lead.

Dickerson has also torn up the
turf, rushing for 283 yards and
five touchdowns on the option.

Both coaches praised the abil-
ity of Dickerson.

”Darne|l is a great athlete, and

he can really throw the football. ‘

There's a quarterback who can
run and throw the football really
well,” Uzelac said.

Dickerson could present a
problem for a Navy defense
whose second leading tackler has
but 47 takedowns.

”Darne|l right now is develop-
ing into one of the top young
quarterbacks in the country,"
Gottfried claimed after Dickerson
had back-to—back career games.
”| just think he's going to get bet-
ter and better, and that he will be
one of the best quarterbacks in
the country.”

Dickerson’s talent is not the
question, however. An injured

The passing game is a danger-
ous weapon when a football
team can get everybody working
together. Last season, Pitt didn't
use a passing game as part of their
offensive scheme, devoting them-
selves almost entirely to the run.

This season started out just
about the same. Tailback Adam
Walker was the No. 1 guy, rush-
ing for 374 yards during the first
four games.

Then Walker went down dur-

” ing the West Virginia game, rein-

juring his groin -and freshly
injuring his ankle. He started the

Boston College game but was
taken out after two plays and
hasn’t played since. He is still day
to day.

As a result, the Panthers have
had to rely on a very inex-
perienced group to spearhead the
attack. Freshman Curvin Richards
emerged at the top of the pack,
gaining 523 yards so far this sea-
son (Richards has played in all six
games, but only started the Tem-
ple game).

Then Notre Dame came into
town and the Pitt offense moved
to a passing game, trying to ex-
ploit their smaller defensive
backs. The plan worked and the
offense was able to move down

the field.

Quarterback Darnell Dickerson
threw for 209 yards against the
fighting Irish, but Pitt lost the
game 30-20. They used almost
the same game plan last week
against Temple and it worked
again.

The Panthers moved the ball
down the field with virtual ease
during a 42-7 win. Dickerson set
another personal best with 287
yards passing.

”The concepts that Pitt is using
now on offense will give us
problems,” Navy coach Elliott
Uzelac said. ”Dickerson is a very
good quarterback; he can throw
and run with the football.”

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 20, T988

The connection that is working
best for the Panthers right now is
Dickerson to split end Henry Tut-
en. They have been able to be-
fuddle opposing defenses so far
this season. ’

Tuten leads the team in receiv-
ing with 21 catches for 401 yards
and three touchdowns. He has
become a big-play receiver.

”Darnell and myself and the
rest of the receivers have a mutu-
al understanding. We know what
we have to do to get open," Tut-
en said. ’’If I'm supposed to run
a 15-yard square route, I know
the ball is going to be there.”

Tuten has improved this sea-

son, due in large part to havin

"I stayed up here during the

used to stay out after practice for

Yet, Dickerson is quick to say

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 20, T988

Tide could turn fortunes of Lions for the worse

This weekend in Birmingham,
the Penn State Nittany Lions will
play what could be the pivotal
game of their season. The 4-2
Lions must defeat Alabama or
else face the very real possibility
ot enduring their first-ever losing
season under Coach Joe Paterno.

_Why should Penn State panic
it they lose to the Tide? After all,
their record would still be above
.500 at 4-3.

Consider the fact that, of their
remaining four games, only one
is a sure victory (Maryland). The
other three games are at No. 6
West Virginia, home for an ap-
parently recovered Pitt team, and
away at No. 2 Notre Dame.

Sure, Penn State is Penn State,
and that means they are capable
of winning any of those three
games, but they are also capable
of losing all three. Is a 5-6 season

VINCE
LONGO

in store for Hapless Valley? This
week's game may decide.
Last week — 6-2 (.750), For the
year —— 45-19 (.703)
Alabama-24, Penn State-22

Don't think the Lions aren’t

aware of the fact that they could

be the first team to present JoPa
with a losing season. Neverthe-
less, the Tide will roll back into
the Top 20 with this victory.

Iowa-31, Purdue-10

Is Purdue really that good that
they beat Ohio State in Columbus
last week, or is OSU just that
bad? Here's guessing that the

Buckeyes just plain stink. Ohio‘

State coach John Cooper will be
granted one year to flounder, but

he’d better produce next year, or
they will be screaming for his
head in Buckeyeland.

Pitt-38, Navy-3

The Panthers can name the
score in this one. lt’s just a mat-
ter of how hard they feel like
playing. Like the Temple game,
call this game a ”character test.”

Picks

Continued from page 18
Upset of the Week
Indiana-21, Michigan-17
What could be better than the
Hoosiers’ going to Pasadena? For
Indiana to beat Ohio State and
Michigan (they've already beaten
OSU) two years in a row would
be unreal.

Georgia Tech-28, North
Carolina-14

For Tech to break their
I 5—game losing streak against Di-

. vision I opponents by blowing

out previously eighth—ranked
South Carolina is bizarre. What
can you say but that the Game-
cocks must have been vastly
overrated?

Wisconsin-19,
Northwestern-10

The fact that this game is rated
a toss—up says a lot about the state

of the Wisconsin program.

Nebraska-52, Kansas State-14
There should seriously be a law

_ against Nebraska playing Kansas

State. If K—State and Kansas
merged, they might be able to
overtake Iowa State in the Big

Eight.
Oklahoma-28, Colorado—24
The Buffaloes lost to the

”other” team from Oklahoma by
20 points. Nevertheless, Colora-
do matches up well with the
Sooners, especially along the
offensive and defensive lines, and
this will keep the game close.

West Virginia-35, Boston
College-10

Seven down and four to go for
the undefeated ’Eers after this
game. Next week's game with
Penn State will .be televised na-
tionally by CBS.

Clemson-27, NC State-10

N.C. State beat Clemson last
year, but this year, the 5-1 Wolf-
pack will not have the element of

surprise on their side.

Navy

Continued from page 15

”Against Temple, we played
above injuries,” Gottfried said,
noting a refurbished offensive
line and a young running back
corps in particular.

”Right now, Navy's playing
with confidence. They're coming
off an open date, which should
give them a chance to heal,”
Gottfried added.

Gottfried’s team has to wait for
another week before they receive
a gift in the way of an off—week.

But a victory this week would
suit them just fine.

 

Henry Tuten has been Darnell Dickersonfs favorite receiving target this season.

good/’
Midway through the season,
both players are confident in the

offense and feel that it has made

great strides.

”After the Notre Dame game,
we made a commitment," Dick-
erson said. ”Everybody has the
right attitude right now. I think
we're doing pretty good.”

Tuten agreed, but did see one

fS\

  :9

problem.

”I think the offense is doing a
wonderful job,” Tuten said. ”We
are putting a lot of points on the
board, but we've been making a
few mental errors, especially
close to the goal line. I believe
that we are going to start to peak.

”When we do that, we are go-
ing to have our streak. We lost
three, and who said we can't win
six in a row?”

Plant

Continued from page 12
have outshone the other, Zeppe-
lin was clearly at the pinnacle of
rock ’n’ roll.

As if the music Zeppelin
produced wasn't enough, the
stage presence evoked by Plant
and Page put the band in a realm
all their own. Plant continues to
separate himself from his peers
with his music and the back-
ground that has made him one of
the most influential artists of the
last 20 years.

Bands such as The Cult and

Kingdom Come have vaulted to

success by carrying the same
chords that put Zeppelin at the
forefront of the music scene.

Some critics have claimed
Now and Zen is lacking in lyri-
cal creativity. Others have called
it a masterpiece, filling the void
between the masterful rock of the
1970s and the new music of the
l980S.

Regardless of his intentions,
Plant has blended his past with
his visions of the future to
produce what will undoubtedly
become a classic album. His
forthcoming stage show should
he no less original than the mu-
sit‘ Zeppelin created and fans so

-eagerly awaited for the 10 years

that Plant and Co. sat atop the
rock world. ’

Paul Kelly and the Messengers

the Velvet Underground, the
Beach Boys, Jimmy Reed, the
Clash and the Ramones for their
style.

The combination of these two
distinctive bands, the Smith-

Messengers, should turn the

i§ILLY BRAGG 

By Erin Flynn
Staff Writer

Billy Bragg, Michelle Shocked,
and Weddings, Parties, Anything
will be performing in their post-
punk traditional folk fashion at
Carnegie Music Hall tonight.

Billy Bragg has been accused
by Elektra of being a ”leading
post—punk exponent of the Anglo-
American protest song tradition.”
He calls himself a ”doubter, dis-
senter, nonconformist, and in-
rlividual in the broadest sense.”
His latest album, Workers Play-
time, proves that, yes, politics can
be personal.

Avoiding glamorized cliches,
Bragg’s songs deal with the real
world and range from the eco-
nomical and personal brutality in
the Thatcher era, to military
memoirs, to a narrative of prison
life.

wonderful jokes, personal stories,
and of course, his own political

I guess that sums it up.
However, she forgot to mention
that she toured the United States
in '88 with Billy Bragg, toured all
of Europe, and has had over 150
gigs so far this year.

When she was younger, her
mother admitted her to a mental
hospital, and there she stayed un-
til the insurance ran out, and the
hospital declared her ”normal.”
Shocked headed towards Amster-
dam, never to speak to her
mother again. Gosh, mom would
be proud now.

Last April, her first album,
Texas Campfire Songs, was
released. The title came from the
fact that it was recorded on a
portable cassette player,‘ while
she sat around a campfire in

Texas. It is a combined sound of
her voice, an acoustic guitar, the
noise of a pick-up truck switch-
ing gears, and very, very loud
crickets. Campfire is the only
known record to have cost less to
record than to buy.

A black and white photo of
Shocked being choked by police
at her arrest incident adorns the
cover of her new August album,
Short, Sharp, Shocked. Her song
ideas have ranged from her
youthful pranks to an actual let-
ter that she received from an old
friend in Alaska.

What is Shocked like? Twenty-
five—year—old Michelle is used to
people wondering whether she is
a boy or a girl. She writes about
caring and surviving. Steering
clear of romantic images, her un-
conventional songs deal with
such issues as sexism, racism and
runaways.

You have to believe her opin-
ions, too, because she has had to

for your time.

handle these situations in her
own life. She considers herself a
”country-blues singer by nature”
and does not write songs that
have painted-up images. She, like
Bragg, reflects on the memories
of society, keeping within the
”real world” mode.

She writes about struggling and
surviving but has such a gentle,
ringing voice that her songs are
wonderfully spooky and
haunting.

The last of the three acts tonight
is the distinctive sound of Austra-
lia’s Weddings, Parties, Anything.
Keeping on the same track as
Bragg and Shocked, WPA is a
mixture of folk and rock, with a
thin coat of punk. Their refresh-

S ing songs give social and histori-

cal perspective, with women
being their dominant theme.

Mirror.

WPA consists of the scratchy
voice and bass of Michael Tho-
mas, Mark Wallace on the piano
and accordian, Paul Clark on gui-
tar, and Dave Adams on drums.
When forming WPA, the three
things that the band members
wanted were harmonies, an ac-
cordian, and traditonal songs in
the /\ustralian—lrish sense.

Their album, Scorn of the
\\7omen, paints a picture of Aus-
tralia's past. The subject matter of
the title track is World War ll. Be-
sides this angry song, they stick
to folk music because they like to
touch people with the directness
of their words.

This three—act performance will

start at 8:30 pm. this Thursday at
Carnegie Music Hall. Tickets
went on sale last Friday at the
William Pitt Union and Carnegie
Mellon Skibo information desks.
Ticket prices are $8 reserved, and

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 20, l988

By Guy Darst

Associated Press Writer
W/\Sl'llNCTON(/\P) Twelve
lawmakers worried that the na-
tion’s nuclear deterrent may be
compromised by safety problems
at U.S. weapons plants asked

. President Reagan on Wednesday

to reassure Congress the facilities
are being operated safely before
their reactors are restarted.
’’Unless we solve the current
problems at U.S. defense produc-
tion facilities like Savannah River,
we will provide the ultimate
unilateral concession the
unilateral disarming of our
nuclear deterrent,” said one of
the 12, Rep. Bill Clinger, R-Pa.
The Energy Department shut

the only active weapons reactor
at the Savannah River plant near
Aiken, S.C., in August after the
plant operator, Du Pont Co., ig-
nored an unexplained power sur-
ge while restarting the reactor.

The department has said it
plans to start one of the three
operable reactors in December or
January, after completing safety
reviews and improvements, with
the other two following later in
1989.

In a letter to Reagan, the 12
lawmakers said ”Restoration of
safe operations and reliable
production are essential to the
defense and security of our
nation."

There were these other de-

velopments Wednesday in the
nuclear weapons manufacturing
story:

Sen. John Glenn, D—Ohio,
chairman of the Senate Govern-
mental Affairs Committee and a
longtime critic of the depart-
ment's weapons production ac-
tivities, said he did not agree with
a call by Gov. Richard Celeste of
Ohio to close the Fernald, Ohio,
uranium processing plant. Recent
congressional testimony revealed
that the department for years had
told contractors to ignore en-
vironmental pollution there.

The plant is closed by a strike.
On a visit to Ohio on Wednes-
day, ‘Reagan was asked whether
the plant should stay closed. ’’I

have word from the secretary of
energy that the plant will not be
opened unless it's absolutely
safe,” Reagan said.

Energy Secretary John Herring-
ton said the department plans fur-
ther increases in its cleanup
budget, which doubled to $1.5
billion this year. In appearances
on NBC—TV and CBS-TV morning
news shows, Herrington said
safety and environmental protec-
tions were adequate but not up
to modern requirements.

The Natural Resources Defense
Council wrote Herrington that it
would sue to prevent the Savan-
nah River reactor restart unless he
pledged by Nov. 11 to compile
an environmental impact state-

27

.Lawmakers ask Reagan to reaffirm nuclear safety

ment. The department said it be-
lieved no statement was required.
Recent congressional testimo-
ny by DOE safety officials has
revealed a 30-year history of mis-
haps at Savannah River, often not
communicated to the depart-
ment, and a disregard of safety
among department managers.
The signers of the letter to the
president Glenn, Clinger and 10
members of the House, including
three committee chairmen asked
Reagan to direct the department
not to operate the reactors until
the department’s new Advisory
Committee on Nuclear Safety
”concludes that public health
and safety will be adequately pro-
tected during reactor operationsf’

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, October 20, 1988

SGB

Continued from page 1
Guseman about the fact that only
Kent Baldauf submitted an appli-
cation for SCB presidential can-
didacy. Jackson and Guseman
discussed the idea of opening up
the petition period. '

As it states in the SGB Election
Code, there is an availability for

write-in candidates. Jackson
therefore concluded that there is
no reason for the board to open
up the petition period.

There is an opportunity,
through writing-in, for those who
do want to run for president or
board, but failed to meet the
original deadline.

The requirements of a write—in
candidate are a 2.5 grade point
average and that he or she sub-
mit his or her transcripts to the
board by Oct. 26.

The last time the SGB elections
included a write-in candidate was
1984.

Committee said that he noticed
that the SCB was becoming lax
in its ways concerning parliamen-
tary procedure.

’’I would like to see the meet-

He also noted that the success
of the University Honors College
has resulted in the ”greatly in-
creased frequency with which
Pitt students are winning major
scholarships.”

Posvar said the development of

the Center for Hazardous Materi— if

als Research has attracted posi-
tive attention to the university
from the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency and other research
groups.

Thomas Detre, senior vice
president of Pitt’s Medical and
Health Care Division, said the
university's participation in the
development of the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute and the Center
for Sports Medicine has also at-
tracted positive responses from
the community.

Detre also recommended
several additions to the programs
offered by MHCD, including the
development of a medical ethics
center, a human genetics pro-
gram and a strengthening of the
bioengineering program.

Provost Rudolph H. Weingart-
ner said the reports of several of
his Working Groups on Under-
graduate Education have been
completed. ,

Another group headed by the
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, Mary L. Briscoe, will at-
tempt to ”determine how to inte-
grate the recommendations of all
units ofthe university” according
to priorities and feasibility, Wein-
gartner said.

He also noted mathematics
Professor Eugene Deskins has

been appointed associate dean_

for CAS.
The Senate did not discuss any
new business.

compromise. They are ready to
bend over backwards to com-

promise and negotiate with the Is-

raelis,” said Zigmund.
Zigmund added,”The moral
capital the Jewish people have
accumulated over 18 centuries of
persecution is beginning to be

used up."

Chigier condemned the idea of
a separate Palestinian state next
to the Israeli border. However, he
said that he will not rule out the
possibility ofJews and Arabs liv-
ing in different parts of Israel
itself.

or partition in which Jews are in
one section and Palestinians are
in the other, all under the military
rule of the Israeli army," said
Chigier.

Chigier said that the existence ,

of a Palestinian national army
would be ’’completely unaccept-
able” to Jews. Chigier justified Is-
rael's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza strip by saying
that the boundaries of most na-
tionsare set by war.

”Israe| has learned from giving
the Sinai Peninsula back to Egypt
that handing over territory to the
Arabs does not guarantee peace,”
he said. a

Chigier said that he believes
the situation has ”reached the
point of no alternatives. The PLO
must be removed as the Palestin-
ian leaders for there to be peace-
ful coexistence in one Israel."
