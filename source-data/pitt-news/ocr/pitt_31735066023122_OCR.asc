The Pittsburgh Pirates, led by Willie Stargell and
Bill Robinson each with two runs batted in, clinched
the National League East title by beating the Chicago
Cubs 5-3 in their final regular season game Sunday.
The Pirates’ _98th victory of the season, coupled
with second-place Montreal’s 2-0 loss to
Philadelphia, sends the Pirates into the best-of-five
National league playoffs Tuesday in Cincinnati
against the Western division champion Reds.
Stargell, who ‘struck out three times and made a
costly throwing error in a loss to the Cubs Saturday,
‘rapped a sacrifice fly and a solo homer that helped
Pittsburgh to a 3-0 lead through five innings’ off loser
Lynn McGlothen, 13-14.
Dave Kingman hit a solo homer in the Chicago

sixth off Bruce Kison, who left the game after that
inning with a’ blister on his throwing hand. And

I Chicago scored single runs in the seventh and eighth

innings off reliever Kent Tekulve.

But Bill Robinson rapped a_bases-loaded, two-run -

single in the Pirate seventh, and Tekulve held on for
his 31st save of the season, tying the team record he
set a year ago. It was also his 93rd appearance, two
more than the old Pirate record he set last season.

Kison, 4-0 in the month of September this season,
raised his season record to 12-7. \ He. is now 23-6
lifetime in September.

In the Pirate first, Tim Foli walked, took third on
Dave Parker’s single and scored on a sacrifice fly by
Stargell. ’

‘Phil Garner singled home another Pittsburgh run

in the fourth and Stargell drove his 32nd homer of
the season in the fifth.

With one out in the Pittsburgh seventh, Omar
Moreno walked and Foli was hit by a pitch.»
Both runners advanced as Parke_r grounded out, and
Stargell was walked intentionally before Robinson’s

hit. - R 
After Larry Bittner singled home a Chicago run in _
the eighth, the Pirates learned in the bottom of the —

inning that Montreal had been beaten.

“The magic number is 1,” said the scoreboard
message at Three Rivers Stadium.

The Pirates’ season total of 98 victories was the
highest by a Pittsburgh team since 1909 when-the
club won 110 games and went on to the World Series.

Secretary of Education Says ‘E very Child Unique’

By MARK COLLINS

“These words—every child uni-
que—should be engraved in every
classroom, every district ofﬁce,
every educational research organ-
ization, every school of education,
and most of all, every person who
works in these institutions,” said
Dr. Robert G. Scanlon, Common-
wealth Secretary of Education in
his keynote address Saturday at
Pitt's two day Reading and Writing
Workshop. .

Quoting extensively from educ-
ational scholar Danial Prescott

«who spoke at a similar conference
at Pitt 25 years ago), Scanlon
stressed the Prescott maxim that
“learning is as needed, as ‘natural,
as sought afterias food or sleep.
But it’s also unique for every

person. What a child perceives
when he reads, or hears, or
sees..*.depends_on what has shaped
him.”

The “folly of making broad
generalizations” about what goes

, on in a child’s mind is especially‘

tragic, in light of continuing
advancements and research in
diagnostic and perscriptive teach-
ing methods, said Scanlon. He
emphasized that the ﬁndings of
research all too often remain in the

teaching labs, instead of being

. utilized in the classroom. Scanlon

commented that the Pitt conference
did much to alleviate this situation.

Dr. Scanlon also spoke on media
relations vs. the schools, claiming

‘ ‘bad schools’. always make good

press. We must ﬁnd a way to make
good schools make good press.
Overall, the schools of Pennsyl-
vania are good schools, and we
really do a good job in educating
our children...teachers can make a
difference. A competent, know-
ledgable and understanding teach-
er is the single; most important
variable in student achievement.

Named Secretary of Education in -

January of this year, Dr. Scanlon
was formerly executive director of
Research for Better Schools, Inc.. a
regional educational laboratory
located in Philadelphia. The lab

‘ has worked extensively in the area

of individualized instruction, and is
a major educational resource center

for _ Pe_nn_sylvania,‘.Delaware .V and..

New Jersey. »

The Pitt annual conference is
sponsored by the Language Com-
munications Faculty of the School

of Education, in conjuction with _

area colleges and universities.

'I‘his year, the conference pre-
sented more than 50 national
reading and writing specialists,
bothin general session and small
group workshops. The topic of
“Every Learner Unique” examined
the reading and writing needs of
the learning-disabled child, es-
pecially gifted children, and a
variety of language skills learning
problems. The workshops stressed

An End to

On September 21 Jews around

“It is a unique holiday to Jews.-

Pirates clinch National League East Pennant, Beat cubs 5 -   3 j

   1, 1979

WASHINGTON AP—If you’re
an American wife and want to
”murder your husband, the way to
do it with reasonable safety is to
make him join the armed services
and get him assigned with you to a
foreign country. But you had‘
better stay out of the forces

’ ~ ‘yourself.

' There’s no sex discrimination. A
husband could get away with
murdering his American wife. if
she's in the military and he isn’t.

The main thing is to make sure

‘ you’re in a country that doesn’t

care much about what Americans

do to one _another on its soil.
There are several such countries’
though U.S. authorities are reluc-
tant to name them.

The General Accounting Office,
the investigative body for Con-
gress, has dug up the case of a U.S.
serviceman and his wife in West
Berlin who decided they wanted to
kill another serviceman.

“Indications are,” says the
GAO, “that the conspirators
researched the question of jurisdic-
tion through legal channels before
committing the murder.” '

A Pentagon lawyer on inter-

national matters, who aked not to
be identified, said he was puzzled
about how they could have done
that. The murder occurred about
three ‘years ago and the first report
was that the wife had done the
actual killing, but later it appeared
that the husband had.

A military court jailed him for life
on charges of complicity and
conspiracy. She drew a sentence of
57 months from a German court for
aiding and abetting, was put on
probation and returned to the
United States, where she could not
be prosecuted further.

As far back as 1957, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that U.S.
military courts could not. try
civilians in peacetime for crimes
punishable by death, when the
crime was committed overseas. In
1960 it decided that the military
could not try American civilians for
anything.

As a result, the GAO said, the
United States now has virtually no
way to prosecute civilians who have
committed crimes and offense
overseas. Since these rulings,
thousands of offenders-from jay-
walkers to murderers-have escaped

‘ The    Way to Murders Your Husband...Send Him Ahmad

punishment.

The GAO found a case in an‘
Asian country where there was a.
conspiracy between husband and’

wife like the one in Berlin. The

husband was sentenced to life in
prison by a military court. The wife;
was returned to the United States-

without being prosecuted at all.
In a European country, a’ wife
shot and killed her serviceman
husband. She was ‘arrested by local
authorities but the judge ruled that
his country could not be “expected
to grant priority” to the case. She
was also released and sent home.

  Copyrights
Up for Grabs

‘In response to a new copyright law that gives em-
5 ployers the legal rights to own the written work of an

/ employee, the'University of Pittsburgh has drafted a

proposal that would allow Pitt in some circumstances
to own and to receive part of the royalties from
works published by professors and other employees.
The Proposed _policy would include’ any written
material in one of three categories, depending-on
who created the idea for the work and’ the amount of
university facilities used to complete the work.

The university has made sensible suggestions to
handle works written at an author’s own initiative
with little use of Pitt’s facilities, or publication com-
missioned by Pitt. The works included in this first
category would be owned by the author who created
it, and the writer would collect all royalties and other

i proceedsfrom publication. Materials commissioned
by the university would become the complete proper-
ty of Pitt, which would receive any proceeds.

These two proposals are quite fair.
authors, whether or not they are employees of the

Original

university, should receive the financialreward their
work produces, and likewise the university should get

the gains from any publication written under its

initiative.

Less sensible is the proposed treatment of
published works that are written at an individual em-
ployee’s initiative, but that require considerable use
of Pitt’s computer, secretarial staff, research
laboratories, or other facilities and resources. Under
these circumstances, a University Patent and
Copyright Committee would decide’ whether Pitt
should ,own an interest in the publication. If the
committee believed the university should retain an in-
terest, a contract would be written to specify who
would own the copyright, and how the proceeds from
publication would be split between the university and
the employee who wrote the book. \

Understandably, the initial’ reaction of many
professors who have seen this proposal is one of

shock ‘and dismay. Reaping the proceeds from any

original publication always has been one of _ the
traditional privileges of professors, whether‘ or not
they take advantage of their access to university
facilities to complete the work. It now appears Pitt is

considering taking that privilege because copyright '

laws would allow this act at a time when the univer-
sity could use the money. _

These, professors ‘see the obvious dangers of the
university’s apparent greed in this case. Not only
would this proposal stop professors from collecting

l

Page 4-Monday, October 1, 1979

small financial incentives that help to push a
professor to spend the time and‘ effort publishing.
If this incentive is curtailed, professors might hot be
as willing to spend the time necessary to create a first-
rate book, and the caliber of teaching at Pitt would
decline because the teaching staff would lack the
initiative to do the research that keeps them abreast
with new developments in their field.

If the university was a profit—making corporation,
the assumption in the proposed copyright
regulations, which holds that Pitt deserves some
return for the use of its facilities, would be valid.
But, the university is a non-profit organization ob-
stensibly seeking to further man’s knowledge, and so
Pitt must accept professors’ use of facilities as an ex- ’
pense they must underwrite to encourage the growth
of learning.

Any university must maintain an atmosphere
where professors and other researchers can work in
an environment free from the hassles of squabbles

. over the royalties for copyrighted materials that they

have written. As it is worded now, the proposal on

copyrights would create an opposite atmosphere,

where professors would be too preoccupied with in-

ternecine political battles about proceeds fromitheir

writings, and not concerned enough with their classes

and other work. Such a development must be.
avoided and Pitt can stem it by allowing professors to

collect all proceeds from their work, whether or not

they take great advantage of the facilities available to
them. ' "

victory‘ is slim over Connally and
Baker.

Scene Three—Baker, Connally
and Reagan have split the midwest
evenly,‘ Kennedy holds a strong
lead over Carter in that area.
Scene Four—Brown becomes
prominent in the western primaries

and Carter beneﬁts, closing in on
Kennedy’s lead. The democratic

party has become split three ways. ,

Reagan is winning western states,

but not by as clear a margin as he

had hoped for. "
Scene Five: Republican party

leaders are in turmoil because they

realize the democrats are split
down the middle but have no
strong candidate among their own
ranks to turn to: Baker, Reagan
and Connally are even-up but polls
show» Carter or Kennedy would
handily defeat all three.

Scene Six—Enter Gerald Ford,
billinghimself as the “compromise
candidate” who is acceptable to all
factions of the Republican Party,
offers to become the party’s
candidate. Polls show Ford, while
still trailing Carter 55-45 and
Kennedy 60-40, is considered a
stronger candidate than the other
three.

The ’76' roles have been reversed,
with Ford, the man on the outside,‘
chiding Carter ‘for his inability to

act presidential and uses the Oval
Office as a hiding place.

‘‘It wasn’t so bad when I was

Scene Eight (1-B)—Kennedy

Ford attacks Kennedy’s National

Health Insurance plan’, his liberal

record in the Senate and the media
overplays Kennedy’s personal life.

‘‘It wasn’t so bad when I was

the country. He narrowly defeats a
Kennedy/ Mondale ticket.

In the spirit of Grover Cleveland
and Richard Nixon. Ford will

    Schubert Kicks Temp|e’sHope

By SAMUEL SCUILLO
Pitt News Staffwriter
PHILADELPHIA-—As the season
progresses, the Pitt football team
looks more and more like last
years’ squad, because of striking
similarities.
’\ Despite Pitt’s 10-9 victory over
" the Temple Owls Saturday night at
Veterans’ Stadium in Philadelphia,
all is not well with our pride and

joy, our source of unrestrained‘

ecstacy on campus on Saturday
afternoons.

As usual, the Pitt defense_bent
but didn’t break, and held Temple

when it counted most--late in the ‘

game when Pitt was trailing 9-7,
and when the Owls were trying to
move into position for a game-win-
ning ﬁeld goal.
But once again, the Pitt offense
» borea close resemblance to a turtle
stuck on its back. The running
game, led by Randy McMillan and
Fred Jacobs, - Artrell
Hawkins and Rooster Jones, was
as good as it’s been in some time.
but the passing game a little less

    Pantherettes Spike Competition to Win Invitational 8  

By JEFF DUROSKO

Asst. Pitt News Sports Editor

A ﬁrst place trophy from the Pitt
Invitational, so elusive for the last
two years, is ﬁnally in the hands of
Pitt lost
only one game in totally outclassing
the rest of the competition at the

\

third annual tournament held here
Friday and Saturday.

The Pantherettes ﬁnished sec-
ond two years ago and a very
disappointing ﬁfth last year.

“We just couldn’t seem to win
our own tournament...until now,”
said head coach Mike Hebert.

“It's still early in the season,
though, and we can't place too
much importance on this win.”

Scoreless . Booters Tie Temple

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pill News Staff Writer

Finally, after one-third of its
season has passd, the Pitt soccer
team has something to be happy
about. Although the Panthers
didn’t win on Friday night against
Temple, they did hold the number
one-ranked team in the East
scoreless, 0-O. \

The Panthers shut out the Owls

' in an impressive overtime contest,

their fourth of six games. Once
again the Panther defense perform-
ance was awesome. The defense
allowed 19 shots to be taken on
winning goalkeeper Scott Thun-
berg. Thunberg recorded 18 saves
on the night.

Junior Jim Hackworth especially
played well against the Owls.’
Hackworth is starting his ﬁrst year
on the Panther squad and cleared a

' number of potential goals from the

net area against Temple.
Offensively, the Panthers were
able to take 18 shots on goal.

, Although he didn’t start the game,

freshman wing Eric Tiedtke shot
four times, as did midﬁelder Danny
Hamm. A couple of Tiedtke’s shots
came in the final minutes of the
second overtime period. Temple
goalie Jeff Kraft was too quick in
stopping these shots which pre-
vented the -Panthers’ ﬁrst win.
The key to the remaining season
may be inﬂuenced by the Temple

contest. With an outcome like this,
the Panthers could develop a better
attitude and drive for the games to
come. ,

“We have to get back to the
fundamentals of the game, and put
everything together out there on
the ﬁeld if we want to keep things
going. With a tie against Temple

‘on our side, we should be more

psyched-up for the games ‘this
week against Mt. Union /and

Bucknell,/’ ’ said Hamm.

Pitt will travel to Mt. Union
College in Ohio Tuesday afternoon
for its ﬁrst away contest of the
year. Mt. Union is coached by
former Panther Joe Luxbacher.
After this game, the /team will
return home Friday for a game
against Bucknell. The Panthers

weredefeated by the Bisons last.

‘The Steelers, who won their last

State and easily handled the Lady 5

Lions 15-4, 15-7. .

With these wins, Pitt was the
number one team in its pool and
therefore received a bye in the first
round of championship play.

Buffalo was again up againstthe

»Pantherettes and couldn’t handle

Pitt this time either. Pitt jumped
off to.a 12-0 lead in the ﬁrst game
before the Royals could ﬁnally
score. The game ended with Pitt
on top 15-1» It --

In the second game, Buffalo got
as close as 8-5 before Pitt pulled
away by 12-5. At this juncture of
the game, Hebertinserted all the
freshmen spikers into the lineup.
Paula Dukewich, Julie Gaul, Robin‘
Kukalis, Ellen Mangus (a starter),
Tina Newton and Shelly Rie-
mersma all played well enough to
hold Buffalo to-one more point
while winning the game 15-6.\

“The Buffalo match was-pretty
weak,” said Hebert after
match. “Penn State is our next
competition and we beat theme
pretty easily in pool play, but
they’ll be better in the playoffs.”

The coach was right: In the ﬁrst
game of the semi-ﬁnal match, the
Lady Lions downed the Panther-
ettes 15-12. Penn State was led by
the superb play of sophomore Ellen
Crandall, whom Hebert calls “one
of the top players in the east.”

The Pantherettes actually led
State 5-1 before the Lions got their

game going. With the score tied at

seven, Penn State reeled off seven
unanswered p_oints_ to lead Pitt
14-7. Pitt then began a comeback

of its own pulling to 14-12 before '

State ﬁnally scored the last point.

in game two, Pitt played as if
playing for a national champion-
ship; spiking, blocking and serving
point after point on the Lions. Pitt
scored 13 straight points before
PSU could get on theboard. When
theypdid score, it was too late, as
Pitt downed the Lions 15-2 to set up
the -rubber game of the match-

the _

the third game, but that was as
close as they got as Pitt won 15-8.
At one point, however. Pitt led
14-3, and then the Lions scored ﬁve
straight points threatening to stage
an upset.

The victory over PSU set up the
matchup which was predicted since
the outset of the tournament; Pitt
vs. Rutgers. These two teams had
last met at the Eastern Regional
ﬁnals last spring with Pitt being
victorious. '

Pitt again defeated the Scarlett-.’~

Knightsl15-5, 15-11. The ﬁrst

game belonged to Pitt. Rutgers was 8

getting the side outs, but just

couldn’t take advantage of .the'

situation to score.

Game two was a little different,
as Pitt had to ﬁght back from
behind throughout the game.
Rutgers had leads of 6-1, 8-4, and
11-8 before Pitt could tie the score
at~11-all. Then, off some great
serving by Paula Olsen, Pitt pulléd
ahead and eventually won the
match on an ace served by Cindy
Chambers.

“We played consistently
throughout the tournament,” said
Hebert, “but the caliber "of
competition was not nearly as good
as what we played out west.”

—- Hebert was pleased with the
entire team’s performance, but
said that Pitt didn’t play as well as
when on their western‘
because, “you only play as well as
your competition pushes you to
play.” .

j The coach added that in the
Rutgers match, Olsen really took
control at the end to help the team
come.back. He also lauded the play
of setter Maria Perez during the
entire tournament.

“We really gained a lot of
conﬁdence on the trip and were
able to approach the tournament
with a good attitude,”_Hebert said.
“We will get better as the season
progresses-” 8
