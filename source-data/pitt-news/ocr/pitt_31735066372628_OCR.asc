after graduation thus giving the
student more “marketability.”

“This program will constrict the
time spent in getting both degrees
separately. Although still in its
embryonic stages, if the program is
ratified, it will gix its recipients
educationally both lines of analytic
thought. It will give students a
broader perspective of percei_ved
problems,” Murray said.

Murray said other schools across
the country employ this program
and that “the dual degree programs
that we have observed work really
well.” ' -

‘Children's Gets
Grant

A doctor from Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh has
received a grant of over $120,000
to study infections in infants.

Kenneth E. Shuit. M.D. Ph.
D., will study certain immuno-
logical mechanisms that must
be corrected or augmented to
enable infants to deal with
infections more effectively.

The three-year grant was
awarded by the National Insti-
tutes of Health through the
National Institute of Allergy
-T , and Infectious -Diseases.

’ 4‘ “The number of serious-
infections in infants, especially
prematures, and their poor
response to therapy suggest that
the newborn is unable to deal
adequately with infection,” Dr.
Shuit said.

Dr. Philip Fireman of Chil-
drer1’s received a grant from the
Lilly Research Laboratories to
establish one of two national
referral centers to study the
recently developed human
insulin for the treatment of dia-
betic patients.

are trying to rally other faculty
to join them in warning stu-
dents about the dangers of"
nuclear war.

Physics professor Dr. Allen
Janis said the idea was to seek
out faculty members who have
dealt with the nuclear war
threat_ in order to gain informa-
tion and disseminate it to other
interested faculty. The goal is
for faculty members, “where
appropriate," to include some
of this information in a lecture,
Janis said.

“The biggest danger we see is
that people aren't as worried
abbut nuclear war as they ouggh t

to be in that theyfindit 2it'tet)t;i- ’

real possibility of surviving a
nuclear war." Janis said. “They

think it is a monplace
occurance rather V n the terri-
ble threat it is——. ese are the

people we worry about. This

issue is one of great urgency
right now.”

Janis said if information
among Pitt faculty is accumu-
lated and widely distributed, it
might possibly be easier for
them to include it in a lerture.

In November, a two day con-
vocation was held at Pitt to dis-
cuss and assess prospects of
nuclear war. Jointly‘ spon-
sored at Pitt and Carnegie Mel-
lon University, this convoca-
tion included a series of events
such as lectures, discussions,
and films.

According to Physics profes-
sor Dr. John Townsend, the
current effort is being pursued
because there was such a large
response at November_’s
seminar. Both faculty and stu-

PittAoademio Administrators To Be Evaluated

By LAURIE MacLEOD

Students, faculty and courses
have always been evaluated at Pitt,
but a recent policy change will now
add academic administrators to the
list.

The Performance Review of Aca-
demic Administrators, which is a
new evaluation policy prepared by
senior administrators and revised
by Chancellor Wesley Posvar, is
designed to improve performance
through counseling and
information.

Three administrators will be
evaluated each year and a full per-
formance review will occur at least
every five years. The administra-
tors to be evaluated this year are
School of Nursing Dean Enid
Goldberg, College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Jerome Rosenberg
a

Evaluatees were chosen by a pro-
cess of elimination, according to
Robert Hickey, assistant vice chan-
cellor for health sciences and a
coordinator of the evaluation
process.

The final review reports of the
three, which will be prepared by
the provost or vice chancellor for
health sciences and submitted to
the chancellor, will include:

0 a retrospective appraisal writ-
ten by .the administrator being
reviewed

0 a fact-finding committee
report, prepared by the administra-
tor’s supervisor and an appointed
committee, containing facts, com-
ments and constructive criticism of
the evaluatee by students, alumni
and other constituents

0 an agreed performance plan

Hickey stressed the confidential-

of gossip in the fact-finding com-
mittee report, saying that all facts
gathered about the administrator
under evaluation would exclude
malicious items and would be kept
confidential. He said committee
members would screen out anony-
mous, irrelevant or malicious
criticisms.

“We don't want to shut people
up. If people want to talk, the com-
mittee will listen,” Hickey said.
“Integrity, validity and confiden-
tiality are the governing principles
for the process.”

According to Hickey, reports on
Goldberg will be submitted toward
the end of the term. »

Goldberg said that although she
is not plased with the mechanism
used for evaluations, because the
process is not spelled out, she has
no concerns about being one of the
first evaluated.

“I’m just one of three, and I
think it’s necessary and appropri-

ate to be evaluated,” she said.

Rosenberg, another evaluatee,
said he feels the evaluation is a
good idea because administrators
are constantly being evaluated by
their supervisors, but now the
faculty can participate. He added
that he didn’t mind being picked as
a “guinea pig” for the experimen-
tal year.

‘‘I was chosen because I’ve been a
dean as long as anyone. But I’m not
close enough to retirement that it
can’t improve my service,” Rosen-
berg said. “Something useful may
come out of this, and we may learn
something.”

Hickey said that the university
deans, in general, will be interested
in seeing it the process is profes-
sional, confidential and objective.

“There has always been evalua-
tions, but not with this elaborate
network or procedure,” he said.

Just how elaborate the evalua-
tion process is, is evident in the

selection of the evaluation
committees. -

While each committee will
report on the contributions, leader-
ship, interpersonal and profes-
sional relationships and influence
with governmental agencies of the
administrator, the selection of
these committees is different for
provosts, senior vice chancellor for
health sciences and deans.

For deans, a seven-member com-
mittee from a panel of twelve
nominees will be chosen, while for
a provost evaluation will entail a
13-member committee. The evalu-
ation of the senior vice chancellor
of health sciences will conducted
by a l2—member committee.
committee.

Committees have been’chosen
and evaluations of the three are
underway.

“We have no track record,”
Hickey said. “It will be interesting
to see how the first round goes.”

Top Technical Graduates

Have you wasted time interviewing with companies that came to your
campus with no intention of hiring —— companies that sent rejection
letters to everyone they talked to, or maybe even cancelled the interview
the day before it was scheduled?

We don’t think it’s fair. That’s why the Equipment Group of Texas

Instruments wouldn’t offer interviews unless we had something else to
offer, too —— CAREERS. We’re as serious about hiring as you are about
getting started in the business world.

We’re looking for engineers and computer science graduates to work on
hundreds of small projects involved with government electronics at our
Dallas, Austin and Sherman, Texas locations.

If you’re interested in state-of-the-art design, manufacturing or software
development, drop by and talk to members of the Equipment Group
(check our schedule with the Placement Ofﬁce).

and, according to Janis, this is
in “formative” stages.

Townsend concluded, “The
educational process can
increase students awareness and
make the facts and dangers
more widely known. Arms con-
trol negotiations have been dis-

therefore our alternatives are
limited. at best. We must exert
whatever pressure we can to
keep the topic a concerned

Kreskin To Perform

By ARPI ASDOURIAN

“I am not a psychic.”

"I am not an occultist."

“I am not a fortune teller."

“I am not a mind reader.”

“I am not a hypnotist.”

The above were stated by the
world's most famous mentalist and
practitioner of E.S.P. (extrasensory
perception)-the Amazing
Kreskin.

A master live performer and a
showman, Kreskin will appear at
Pitt's David Lawrence Auditorium
this Thursday, Feb. 4 at 8 p.m.

Kreskin began developing his
powers at age eight. By 11 he was
already a performing magician and
hypnotist. Kreskin, who no longer
believes in hypnotism, says that
what he does is “inherent in
everyone.

“I try to create wonderment," he
said of his unusual abilities. “I
dramatize whatever ability I have. I
Stimulate curiosity into the world
of science.”

A scientist at heart, Kreskin
injects both research and investiga-
tion into his performances. When
he performs, he demonstrates

supreme concentration through
the use of his dynamic stage per-
sonality and persuasiveness.

Kreskin has hosted an
internationally-syndicated TV
show, TheAmazing World ofKres-
kin, and has appeared as a guest on
major television talk shows includ-
ing “The Mike Douglas Show,”
“The Tonight Show,” and “The
Dick Cavett Show." He performs
regularly at clubs and colleges
around the country and is also the
author of the best-seller “The
Amazing Kreskin.” The “Kreskin
E.S.P. Game”, which is marketed
by Milton Bradley, is yet another
brainchild of Kreskin.

In his performance here at Pitt,
Kreskin will demonstrate his abil-
ity to perceive thoughts through
E.S.P. in his “check test”-—an
audience member will hide his per-
formance fee somewhere in the
room and Kreskin must find the
check within ten minutes or forfeit
the payment. V

To reinforce his credibility,
Kreskin offers $20,000 to anyone
who can show he had an

accomplice.

By CAROL PICCOLI

W-hen Joe Carducci entered
Pitt as an undergraduate, it
wasn’t chords or lyrics that
occupied his mind, but Men-
del’s Genetic Theory and parts

f the human cell.

Carducci graduated in 1974
with a biology major. He began
to further his education, also at
Pitt, but after one term, Car-
ducci decided he had had
enough school. He quit and
found a job in order to support
himself.

Currently, Carducci is a sub-
stitute teacher for the Mt.
Lebanon school district.

While Carducci attended col-
lege, he had no special interest
in music. His fascination didn’t
'come until a few years later.
“Although, I did have lessons
when l was a kid,” (Iarducci
added.

“I had originally written a
large selection of songs for
myself. Someon-e told me that
they sounded like children’s
songs, so I decided to make a
simple-to-read book out of
them,” Carducci said.

Musical Coloring Book, is
“easy to follow” so that young
and old non-musicians can
learn to play contemporary
songs on the guitar and piano
in a short. period of time. The
right pages in the book are all
lyrics, and the left pages are
filled with musical notes. There
are 80 different selections in

Carducci’s book, called the

“If you know four or fiv

eof

the most common chords, then
you can play almost any song,"

Carducci added.
In December, Carducci
his own television special

had
on

WTOV, channel 9 in Steuben-

ville, Ohio. Shortly after

the

show aired, Carducci and a
friend recorded 12 of the songs
that were on the T.V. special for

an album called “Songs
Children from the
Coloring Book”. It will
available at
Record Marts this month.
Recently, Carducci be

t The Students’
Side to
Supply-Side

The first year of President Reagan’s presidency is
over, and magazines, newspapers and Congress
abound with criticism and praise for Reagan’s
accomplishments and disappointments. While his
supporters constantly remind us that the hard times
this nation now faces—a nearly 9 percent unemploy-
ment rate and an 8 percent inflation rate—are the
result of overspending by previous admnistrations,
the advocates of supply-side economics can hardly
consider themselves void of any responsibility for
many of the woes students now face.

To fill you in on Reagan’s track record thus far, we
offer you the following facts:

0 The Reagan administration’s recent tough
stance on those who default on student loans. While
we would not wish to condone or sanction this prac-
tice, we feel the approach approved by the current
administration may encourage the very activity it
was designed to prevent. High interest rates and the
strict policy agianst negotiation, combined with an
economic situation in which job opportunities for
graduating seniors are dim, may very well force
many former students, whether they’d like to or not,
to default on their student loans. They simply won’t
be able to make the payments.

0 Social security payments to students will be
reduced 25 percent each year until 1985 when the
entire program will .be eliminated. This may not
drastically concern those graduating soon, but those
who have rushed to the admissions office for early
registration, as well as continuing students, will
certainly feel the pinch. Food, clothing, books, shel-
ter and many other “unnecessary luxuries” of col-
lege life will have to go.

0 If social security won’t help you pay your way
through college, students shouldn’t expect work
study to either. The Reagan administration plans to
eliminate 250,000 work study jobs.

0 It seems obvious that not only is the current
administration denying us our right to work and pay
our rent, but it is also denying us the right to low-
interest loans, which don’t require payment on the
interest until graduation. The new policy will
demand that interest on the few loans that aren’t cut
be paid while students are still in school. Without
work study and without social security, one wonders
how many students are going to accomplish that
‘task.

It is no wonder to us why the current administra-
tion is cracking down on loan defaulters. With all
the new requirements and the circumstances under
which a college education Wlll be tinancea, the mea-
gan adminstration realizes that in a few years there
will be no more defaulters to crack down on.

Of course, one also has to wonder if'there'will be
any students from middle class families attending
college.

Programming

Dear Editor: -

I would like to respond to Eric
Nagel’s ]an.24 letter in The Pitt
News(“Concert Programming

‘ ‘Incredulous’ ”) about our efforts

toward concert programming at
Pitt. First of all I would like to
correct a few inaccurate figures.
The attendance at the Pablo Crui-
se/ARS Homecoming Concert was
1300 and not 3000 as reported in the
original Pitt News article. I have
no idea whence Larry Lederer, the
author of the article, drew this fig-
ure but a referral to Showcase’s.
review of the concert will leave no
doubt that the concert was less than
amply attended. I would ask Mr.
Nagel,_who seems to have an idea
how much such presentations cost,
to use his calculator and figure out
how much we would have had to
charge to each of those 1300 stu-
dents to break even. Yes, we lost “a
substantial amount.”

Second, the“agency and promo-
ter heat" of which Ed Kelley, the

former concert chairperson, spoke i

was indeed real and not a perceived
conspiracy as Mr. Nagel suggests.
For "example, our contract with
ARS explictly stated that our pro-
motional efforts must be restricted
to campus media. This is an exam-
ple of “promoter heat” because the

local promoters, as well as ARS, _

did not want to decrease the
group’s marketability for other
Pittsburgh dates. Another exam-
plezwe were very close to booking
the Commomdores last term. We
were dealing. directly with the
group’s management and nearly
had a deal completed when they
told us, again explicitly, that they

Cottam Exce

‘Inflammatory
Musings ’

Dear Editor:

When a professor of political
science has the audacity to compare
the fundamentalism of the Rev.
Jerry Falwell to that of “Ayatol-
lah” Khomeini (as Dr. Richard W.
Cottam attempted in vain in the
Jan. 27 issue of The Pitt News), the
old saw about a little knowledge
being a-dangerous thing enjoys a
new incarnation.

Not only has Dr. Cottam
exceeded the limits of his scholarly
expertise in his pontificating, but
he also can be charged with,irre-
sponsibility as a scholar insofar as
he has allowed a college newspaper
to quote his inflammatory mus-
ings. The last time I checked; Fal-
well and the Moral Majority had
not executed any “liberals”, nor do
they intend to do so. Nor had they
named or even described the
“satanic forces" or “Antichrist”

-: .mtl;Iat Cetitamrc-omends they see

were unable to play at Pitt because
the Pittsburgh promoter they
worked with did not like the idea of
the Commodores doing extra Pitts-
burgh dates, dates in which they
did not have a piece of the action.
The list goes on and on, as in the

-cases of David Brenner and Carly

Simon Pitt dates which fell
through because we were outbid by
our Pittsburgh competition.
Furthermore, I would not betray
the promoter’s confidence, but let
me say that the telephone conversa-
tions we had with promoters have
been less than “cooperative,”
though we have tried to work
together with them. "

At Alfred Universtiy, Mr. Nagel,
where you say you gained your
concert programming experience,I
doubt, as you suggested, that you
experienced promoter pressure.
Alfred, is not in either the Roches-
ter or Buffalo markets; Alfred is 70
miles from Rochester and even
further from Buffalo! Pitt is in
Pittsburgh Is this significant?

involved in the “liberal
community”—whatever that term
is supposed to designate.

As a Greek Orthodox Christian
who does not identify theologically
w American Protestant funda-
.talism, I am nevertheless dis-

difficulty programming any dates

because of promoter pressure,
Slippery Rock State College, about
50 miles north of Pittsburgh, often

gets groups who have just played

in Pittsburgh the previous day-
for half price! I submit, Mr. Nagel,
that you know absolutely nothing
about concert programming in an
urban setting.

Lastly, I would like to comment
on Johnette Howard’s cartoon in
the ]an.29 The Pitt News. Despite
our difficulties in concert pro-
gramming we have presented Pure

A 1):

Prairie League, Maynard Fergu- ;

son,Spyro Gyra, Pat Metheny, and
Pablo Cruise and the Atlanta
Rhythm Section (both high on the
charts at the time of their date).
Coming attractions are Chic and
the Outlaws. Some fish and seals

  Inside Story

Job H unting :

/

. ‘ The Pitt News, wednesday;reiB;aaiyi1‘3,‘n 1582*‘

; Looking through the want ads can sometimes help in the job search.

Roth Photo

You’ve been preparing for the day
for many years now, and for Pitt
students graduating in April, the
time has finally come——the time to
enter “the real world.”

The prospect of entering into the
job market can create anxiety for
many students. But if a person is

properly prepared for job hunting,“

these anxieties can be alleviated.

Whether you are graduating in
April 1982 or August 1985, it is never
too early to begin working on
resumes arid cover letters.

Having a resume can be advan-
tageous, even when looking for a
summer job. ‘

If you have any questions regard-

ing career plans, resume writing or ‘

job hunting, Pitt has the staff and
facilities ready to help.

Career Counseling Center

The Career Counseling Center is
not just another name in the long list
_of Pitt’s services and facilities. It is
possibly oneof the most pragmatic
departments in the university.

The Career Counseling Center is
part of the University Counseling
and Student Development Center,

which also includes Learning Skills,
Psychological Services and Dis-
abled Student Services. The cen-
ter’s services are free of charge to all
members of the university, past and
present.

The center consists of career
counseling, seminars, planning, an
extensive career library and an

— internship office. Marti Moore and

Teddy Fakles are the full-time

career counselors, along with some ,

Pitt graduate interns who do part-
time counseling.

The career counselors serve
undergraduates who have no idea
what to major in and. alumni_ who
have been out of school for thirty
years and want to start a new
career. They see students who
know in which particular career
they are interested and need advice
on what they should be doing now to
plan for it, as well as women who
have been out of the job market for
years and want to re-enter it. In
other words, they serve a diversity
of situations in the course of a day.

One of the main attractions of the

Career Counseling Center is the _
Career Library, an up-to-date and "

comprehensive collection of career
information. It carries materials

“Internships are a wonderful
way to make contacts and learn
about business,” explained
Sheila Quinlin, a recent graduate
of Pitt who is now a management
trainee at KDKA-TV. Quinlin
interned for the station’s Pitts-
burgh Today show in the last
term of her senior year and

the management trainee
position.

“It made a big difference that I
here when I was an intern,”
Quinlin remembers. Quinlin

.believes that “an internship is a
valuable experience for all
students.”

Why is an internship reward-
ing? According to Nancy Den-
hart, internship coordinator at
Pitt, an internship is “a work
experience that has a substantial
learning component.’_’

“You go there with the under-
standing, ahead of time, that you
expect to contribute to an organ-
ization,” she continued. “Also,
you expect to learn something
related to your career interests.
And you hope to be able to dem-
onstrate that learning to a faculty
sponsor for academic credit.”

To arrange an internship, an
interested student must first reg-
ister with the Internship Office,
located in room 213 of Schenley
Hall. A student can choose an
advertised or a selfdesigned
internship.

Advertised internships are

‘ those that companies offer to
students. These internships are
listed in catalogues in .the intern-
ship ofﬁce. The ‘available intern-

ips:

ships are divided up by majors.
For example, they offer business
management, computer and
information science, health-
related, social services, political
science and communications
internships. They are located in
Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and
Washington, D.C. Students can
look through the catalogues and

._choose from among the 300

internships listed. After check-
ing with an internship advisor, a
student can apply.

If a student chooses to self-
design the internship, he should

first contact an employer or an,

organization for an interview or
talk with an internship advisor
for help in locating an internship.
Having found one, the student
then interviews with the pro-
spective on-site internship
supervisor

After the student follows the
steps for an advertised or self-
designed internship, he must
find a faculty sponsor who will
evaluate the internship work for
academic credit.

Then, the student completes,
with his faculty advisor, an
internship agreement that
includes all the necessary infor-
mation about the internship.
Finally, the student registers for
credit and is ready to begin the
internship.

The office holds briefing ses-
sions to aid students through the
internship process.

“One thing our office can do is
help you investigate what
exactly you will do at the intern-
ship site. Also, we send evalua-
tions to the sponsor at the end of

Effort

the internship,”
Denhart.

Most internships don’t reward
students with money but with
credit. Denhart describes an
internship as “very much like
entry-level jobs in a given organi-

explained

zation.” She also explains that,

even though interns are not paid,
the experience is invaluable.

What are the qualifications for
prospective interns? -

“They (employers) want a stu-
dent who is prepared in their par-

’ ticular area—a person who has
had at least two years of college
and has most of their basic
courses out of the way, concen-
trating on their major,” Denhart
explained.

More and more students are
participating in internship pro-
grams, according to Denhart.
She believes that students want
internships because “they are
realistic about their future. They
understand their career is impor-
tant and it is a developmental
process in getting a job.”

According to Denhart, being
an intern is important to employ-
ers. “A representative in a major
advertising agency wanted to
see students participating in
internships because those stu-
dents would have tested their
skills and they would know what
that job is about,” she said.

“When they (employers) go to
hire somebody, they look at
experience. They see that you
have already been working hard
to prepare for your future, so
you must be interested in that
career,” Denhart concluded.

careers, and when the staff finds
they don’t have much information
about a particular field, they will do
‘their own research and write their
own materials.

They offer directories for gradu-
ate schools and a fairly complete
collection of information on colleges
around the country.

Materials may usually be checked
out for two weeks, with the excep-
tion. of those listed as reference.
Assistance is always available from
career librarian Caroline Grundy
and the work-study employees with-
out an appointment. .

“Without question,” said Moore,
“the resume is the most important
single ‘tool available to the job
searcher.”

The center offers weekly resume-
writing workshops, and anyone can
make an appointment to have their
resume looked over by a counselor.

The Internship Office, also part of
the Career Counseling Center, is
directed..by Nancy Denhart and
offers paid and unpaid positions
both in the Pittsburgh area and else-
where, including many in Harris-
burg and Washington, D.C. If a stu-
dent handles it properly, he or she
may land an internship that offers
both a salary and college credit.

Appointments may be made with
the Career Counseling Center by

University Placement
Service

Pitt is not only a leader in academ-
ics and athletics, but also a leader in
technology when it comes to the
Universityiof Pittsburgh Placement
Service. A

The Placement Service, located
in- 219 Schenley Hall, helps students
find full time career positions when
they graduate. The staff at the
Placement Service helps students’

-organize material-for the job search -

through the use of video tapes,
career library, individual counseling,
special workshops and on-campus
interviewing. Some workshop top-
ics include resume writing and inter-
view skills.

“What you learn here at the
Placement Service can be useful
throughout your life,” said Robert
Hopkins, director of Placement
Service.

Hopkins also speaks of two uni-
que features of the Placement Ser-
vice that “contribute to Pitt’s
reputation asone of the’finest uni-
versity placement services in the

country.” Both features involve the
use of a unique computer service.
First, is the “sign-up” system by
which students are scheduled for
interviews with prospective employ-
ers by computer. This system ena-
bles students’ interests and employ-
e_rs’ qualifications to be more effi-
ciently matched. However, when a

- company’s recruiting-needs are too

limited to send an interviewer, or
they are located at a distance from
Pittsburgh, or their needs are imme-
diate, the Placement Service has a
second computerized program to
bring a company and student
together.

This system is called the CATCH
system. Here the students provide
information on degrees and majors,
special skills, geographical prefer-
ence and career objectives. This
information is filed into the CATCH
data base. When a company calls
the Placement Service, a computer
search can be performed “catching”
those current students and alumni
who fit the needs of the company,

- according to Hopkins.

In addition to becoming part of
the CATCH data base, upon regis-
tration, a student receives a Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Handbook, which
describes what the Placement Ser-
vice offers, and advice on job hunt-
ing. They also receive the College
Placement Annual, a national publi-
cation which lists approximately
2,000 potential employers.

An appointment is-not needed to
register with the Placement Service.
The office is open from 8:30 a.m.-
5:00 p.m. Tuesday through Friday,
and 8:00 a.m.—-7:00 p.m. on
Monday.

These students are participating in a career workshop offered by the University
Placement Service.

The Resume’

The resume’ is one of the most
important tools available to a job
searcher. It tells a prospective
employer what you know, what
you have done, what you can do
and what you would like to do.

0 A resume’ is valuable as an
“advertisement” and digest of

. your job qualifications; your first
formal introduction to an
employer. It is important that
your resume’ does justice to
your qualifications, emphasizing
your strengths and playing down
your weaknesses.

0 A resume’ should be long
enough to include all necessary
information about yourself, but
short enough to read quickly.
One page is sufficient for the
average graduating student.
Only information that the
employer requires in order to
properly -assess your back-
ground should be included; for
example, name, address, phone
number, education, experience,
and activities. ,_

0 It is allowable and to your
advantage to “slant” your
resume’ in the direction of your
career objective. Highlight your

strong points and achievements,
and stress aspects of yourself
that would appeal to an employ-
er’s interest.

0 Also include any awards
received, high grade point aver-
age, summer and part-time job
experience and internships.

0 ‘Many students choose to
have their r_esume’s printed pro-
fessionally as a means of obtain-
ing copies. It insures top quality
and a professional-appearing
resume’. Xeroxing is also ac-
ceptable if high-quality copies
can be made.

Cover Letter

0 In some situations a well-
written cover letter is the key to
getting an interview. For a major-
ity of executive-level positions,

. 4) Would you mind relocating? 

Job Tips

Resume, Cover Letter
And Interview

the screening process begins
with the reading of an applicant’s
letter.

9 Make sure to include basic; ,
information such as the type of

— job you are seeking, why you are)
qualified for the position and
what you can contribute to the
company to which you are
applying.

0 Since the letter must create
a good impression to a prospec-
tive employer, use high-quality
business stationery.

0 Correct spelling, grammar
and punctuation are very impor-
tant, so be sure to proofread
your letter before mailing it.‘

0 Be sure to use the correct
name of the prospective
employer. If necessary, call the
company to which you are apply-
ing and ask a secretary for the
name of the person who does the
hiring. " —

0 Always use the proper form
for the letter and envelope
address, and keep a copy of each
letter sent.

The Interview ,

Doing your homework is an
important part of preparing for a
job interview. You will definitely
feel more confident if you have
thoroughly prepared for it.

0 Know something about the
company to which you are apply-
ing. Some sources of informa-
tion are business directories,
professional magazines, a local
chamber of commerce, current
employees at the firm and knowl-
edgeable people in your pro-
spective field.

0 Be prepared for any ques-
tions a prospective employer
might ask. Some examples are:

1) Why would you like to work
for us?

2) Tell us about yourself. "   l

3) What are your future plans? 5:

5) What are your hobbies?
6) How will your skills fit into this
organization?

Worrying Chipman

 ,,ay AMIN GHOSSEIN

It may be Wednesday, but for the
Pitt basketball team it’s still Friday
night. Steve Beatty is still at the
foul line awaiting the ball from
referee jack Prettyman. And then
the call and the emotional sag.

“Monday’s practice was -terrible.
The kids still haven’t recovered. I’ll
have to wait for Wednesday’s prac-
tice to see if they’ve recovered,” Pitt
Coach Roy Chipman lamented
yesterday.

With a four-game road trip star-
ing his team in the face, Chipman
is anxious to get the team thinking
of the future-—the immediate
future such as Rhode Island on

-;;:_.~§l1ursday night.

The Rams, who have on1y.a 1-6
record in the Eastern 8 and a 6-11
overall mark, have been snakebit-
ten, according to Chipman.

“They’ve lost six games by one
point. They took West ’ Virginia
into overtime once, and lost by two
the next time. This will be a very
‘tough basketball game.”

It’s hard to fathom how Claude
English’s Rhode Island team has
lost so many games. You couldn’t
predict it from the team’s statistics,
Rhode Island has no less than three
players among the top 10 in scor-
ing in the Eastern 8.

Marc Upshaw; a 6-6 forward, is
the leading scorer in the league

with a 20.4 points per game aver-
age, while guard Horace “Pappy”
Owens is ninth with a 14.1 average,
only one point ahead of teammate
Kevin Whiting.

“They’ve got four starters back
from a team that won 21 games, so
you know they’re going to be
tough. They just haven’t had any
luck,” Chipman said.

While Rhode Island looms as a
sleeping giant, a giant that Chip-
man hopes will stay asleep until
after Thursday, the second-year
Pitt coach has to worry more about
his own team’s problems.

A major problem right now
appears to be the play of senior
guard Dwayne Wallace. Or lack of
play. Against West Virginia, Wal-
lace, who was touted as a pre-
season All-East candidate, looked
awkward, tentative, and lost.
Remember this is the same man
who almost singlehandedly took
control of games last year (against

.WVU last year, he scored ten

straight points). 1

“I don’t know what the problem
with'Dwayne is. I wasn’t happy
with his performance against West
Virginia and I don’t think he was
either. We’ve tried to be patient but
I am getting a little upset,” Chip-
man said of his senior point guard.

Against West Virginia, Chip-
man inserted Billy Culberston

Pitt Coach Roy Chipman was still upset yesterday with the controversial outcome of
Friday’s Pitt-West Virginia game. Chipman hopes the ill effects of the team’s heart-
breaking loss following an official’s call won’t carryover into Pitt’s next game,
against Rhode Island, the Eastern 8’s sleeping giant.

Sophomore Gary Groshner
starred as the Pitt Panther men’s
volleyball team placed second in
the Nittany Lion Invitational this
past weekend.

The Panthers’ only loss came at
the hands of defending Eastern
champion Penn State in the finals
10-15 and 9-15, as the No. 3 Nittany
Lions went on to win the tourna-
ment for the second straight year.

The field was divided into two
groups of four teams each. The top
two teams from each group went
into the semi-finals.

Pitt won its group, defeating
Edinboro State 15-8 and 15-4, Army
15-10 and 15-12 and Western Onta-
rio of Canada 15-7 and 15-4.

The Panther spikers overpow-
ered league foe George Mason in
the semi-finals 15-10 and 15-1, to
advance to the finals.

Pitt Head Coach Ray Reilly was
enthused with his team’s season-
opening performance.

“I was very pleased with things
that happened,” said Reilly. “It
helped to see things we can
improve. The tournament was a
good season opener. It was strong
enough to push us to win.”

Groshner, - the team captain,
turned in a fine performance
throughout the tournament at the
leftside power hitter position.

“Groshner had‘ a great tourna-
ment,” said Reilly “So did Dave
Baird, our setter, Bill Knuth and
Brian Devine. In fact, Icould name
all the players. They did a fine job
this past weekend.”

“Our success this weekend

.,..._ Tu...-...... ..-..-1-.» .. . .

Pitt Spikers Finish Second At Tourney

shows we can beat Penn State,”
said Groshner. “Our passing was
good through all the games, but
not against Penn State. We played
terrible against them, but still lost
by only five points.”

Both Reilly and Groshner
believe the squad has improved tre-
mendously over last year.

“We’re definitely way ahead of
last year,” said Groshner. “Our
defense is much better. A couple
more tournaments and we’ll be
decent." ’

The Pitt spikers will be working
this week to improve their block-
ing, something Reilly believed was
weak in the invitational.

The Panthers’ next competition
is this weekend, when they travel to
Ohio for the Ohio State
Invitational.

The 12-team field includes two
top 10 teams, Ohio State and Ball
State, along with Purdue and
Tennessee.

According to Reilly, this tourna-
ment will host some top national
talent.

“It's a strong tournament,”

- -- ~ av...

 

Reilly said. “The competition. is,

excellent. Our major challenge
will be to do well. We’ve never done
very well in this particular tourna-
ment.” Coming off his strong
showing at Penn State, Groshner is
looking forward to getting back
into competition again.

“I was lucky this weekend," said
Groshner. “I've gotten back out of
the hole I was in the beginning of
the season. We’ll see.what happens
this weekend. Ohio State and Ball
State are top-ranked teams. We’ll
have two good teams to work
with.”

Gymnasts Place 4th inTourney *“

By BRIAN BALK

The Lady Panther gymnastics
team took a respectable fourth-
place finish at the second annual
Cat Classic at the University of
Missouri Saturday.

The Lady Panthers met up with
five of the strongest teams in the
nation.

According to Pitt head coach
Donna Sanft, “It was a very com-
petitive meet. Every team there was
nationally-ranked.”

The winning trophy was cap-
tured by the Penn State Lady Lions
with a score of 143.25, followed by
Louisiana State University with
142.05, and the host team, the Uni-
versity of Missouri with 139.65.

The Lady Panthers came in fourth
with a total team score of 136.6.

Sophomore Karen Martin
turned in one of the finest perfor-
mances of the meet. She not only
took a second place in the vault
with a score of 9.1, but also cap-
tured a fifth place in the uneven
bars with a stellar 9.2 routine.

Among the hundreds of compet-
itors at this meet, senior. Holly
Martino was another Lady Panther
who displayed national-caliber
ability. Martino’s execution of her
well-choreographed floor exercise
routine won her an eighth-place
finish. She also took a fifth in the
vault_with a score of 8.95.

ies, she suffered a torn quadracep
muscle in the process and was
unable to compete in the finals.

“I thought it would be prudent
not to put Regina in. I didn’t want
to take any chances,” said Sanft.

A welcome surprise for the
injury-riddled Lady Panthers was
the performance of senior Karen
Zandi. Zandi qualified for finals in

Sanft said she is hoping Shirk
can return to her accustomed all-

year at Pitt, Shirk consistently led

Sanft and the Lady Panther
team, which finished llth-ranked
last season, got a much-need ’
boost from the many high scores
they received at the meet. Accord-
ing to Sanft, the scoring by the
more-adept national-caliber
judges was higher than the marks
the Lady Panthers routinely
receive from local judges who are
less experienced at rating highly
accomplished gymnasts such as
Pitt’s. Thus, according to Sanft,
such local judges generally score
the gymnasts lower.

Whatever the reason, the Lady
Panthers’ Martin, one of the team’s
stars of the meet, was pleased with
her marks.

Panther Eric Tiedtke retained the scoring touch that marks
his outdoor play, as the Pitt soccer team won thespirit
Indoor soccer tournament this weekend at the Civic Arena.

Indoor Booters Win

LISA GRENEVICKI

The Pitt Panther indoor soccer
team captured its first victory of the
season, taking first place in the
Spirit Indoor Soccer Tournament
this past weekend at the Civic
Arena.

Junior Eric Tiedtke, leading
scorer for the Panters this past fall,
led the team with four goals,
including the winning goal in the
championship game.

Pitt was joined in the competi-.
tion by four Keystone League ama-
teur teams consisting mainly of
area college players. Each team
played four games,.with the top
two teams advancing to the finals.

The Panther booters defeated
Dunlevey 2-l, Harmarville 3-1 and
Upper St.Clair 2-l. Their only loss
came, 1-0, at the hands of Beadling.

With only one loss, Pitt
advanced to the final for a rematch
with Beadling.

In the championship game, it
took Tiedtke, playing with a taped
ankle he injured back in the fall
season, only 15 seconds to rocket a ~
shot into the Beadling net. That
was all Pitt needed, as they went on
to win 1-0.

Beadling did challenge the
Panthers, in the last two minutes,
constantly getting off shots, but the
Pitt defense held them off.

In addition to Tiedtke’s goals,
juniors John Hagenbuch and Tom
Trempus, sophomore Nick Wilson
and freshman Jim Steele each
scored a goal for Pitt in tourna-
ment play.

The Panthers were also aided by
a fine performance in goal by new-
comer Jay Hirt.

“Hirt is an upperclassman who
was ineligible to play for us this
fall because he was a transfer,” said
Pitt Head Coach Leo Bemis. “He
did a fine job in the net for us.”

“We did a fine job in the tourna-
ment considering it was our first
competition as a team,” added
Bemis. “We played a good defense
and had good intensity."

Tiedtke credited the Panthers’
success to teamwork.

“Indoor soccer is a different
game (than outdoor soccer) ," said
Tiedtke. “You have to\keep hus-
tling and it takes more skill and
effort. It's a closer game, much
more tighter. It takes more of a
team effort. When you feel like a
team, you play better. I have good

, teammates. I couldn't have scored

if they didn’t pass me the ball.”
The Panther hooters’ next tour-
nament will be this weekend, when
they travel to Wheeling College in
West Virginia.
Pitt will be competing 2820.",

nia Wesleyan, Geneva College and
Indiana of Pennyslvania. The
teams will be split into five-team
pools, with the top two teams
advancing to the finals.

Bemis expects the Wheeling
tournament to give Pitt a stiff
challenge.

“This tournament will have

much stronger competition over-
all,” said Bemis. “We’ll have to
keep playing together and keep a
winning attitude. We’ll have to
have goodball control and do a lot
of shooting—-—accurate and hard.”

“We’ll have to learn to use the
(side) boards and space better,” said
Tiedtke. “We’ll just have to keep
playing as a team.” *»

age 15

By scorr DELLETT

After training five years with
the Pitt Aquatic Club, Jan Uje-
vich believed a change of
scenery would help her swim-
ming career. It took a two-year
cross-country swimming jour-
ney for Ujevich to find out that
the right place for her was back
at Pitt.

Ujevich’s path into competi-
tive swimming differed from
that of most swimmers. She
started out at the late age of 11 at
the YMCA in Sewickley. While
she attended Center High

.School, Ujevich took first place
at the Pennsylvania State Meet
in the lO0—yard breaststroke and
the 200-yard individual medley
three consecutive years. This
was an outstanding feat, con-
sidering that Center High
didn’t have a pool:/

Ujevich said her lack of com-
petition on a high school team
was a benefit, not a deterrent. to
her swimming career.

“I didn’t have to swim dual
meets, which gave me breaks
away from the training,” Uje-
vich said. “Swimming two or
three dual meets a week takes a
lot away from a swimmer.”

Instead of continuing train-
ing at the Pitt Aquatic Club and
representing Center, Ujevich
decided that training in Texas
during her senior year in high
school would benefit her swim-
ming career and ease her adjust-
ment into collegiate competi-
tion.

“I asked Coach Bergen (the
women’s swimming coach at
the University of Texas) if I
could train down there and he
agreed," Ujevich said. “At that
time, Texas was my first choice
of schools, but the coach and I
had a conflict and I returned in
December and trained with the
Pitt Aquatic Club for the rest of
the year.”

After wiping Texas off her
list, Florida and Pitt were the
schools Ujevich considered
attending. After visiting the
Florida campus in Gainesville

Nordheimer:
The Honing of a Diver

By SEAN BARNES

Rex Nordheimer has emerged

alone as Pitt’s only diver as next.

month's NCAA Eastern Regionals
quickly approach. Injuries and
academic problems have put Pitt’s
other two divers out for the season,
so No-rdheimer must face the pres-
sure of being the defending Eastern

Champion mens’ diving team’s.

sole representative.

Nordheimer is improving at
each practice, but he knows his cur-
rent limitations. Joining Pitt’s div-
ing team under Coach Julian Krug
was a difficult step for Nordheimer
in his freshman year last season. He
knew he was joining a team known
nationally, as well as regionally.
With a minimal one-meter diving
repertoire and no three-meter div-
ing experience, he set out to watch,
learn and work.

Nordheimer had good back-
ground for diving—he is a very
agile and active person involved in
skiing, gymnastics, skateboarding,
frisbee and photography. All these
involve either an excellent sense of
balance or an appreciation and
knowledge of art. Diving is both
physically exerting and artistically
judged.

His enjoyment of diving off a

iEtl1eri

.board was first nurtured while he

was a student at Concord High
School in Wilmington, Delaware.
When his parents moved near Phi-
ladelphia his senior year in high
school, Nordheimer commuted
with his father into Wilmington.
He had a good year diving that sea-
son under a tough coach, but felt he
could do better.

At Pitt, under a coach such as
Krug, Nordheimer’s skill acceler-
ated on both the one- and three-
meter boards.

“Julian is the best thing that has
happened to me,” said Nordhei-
mer. “I’m amazed at the confidence
I’ve gotten in trying new dives. Ido
miss not having any other men on
the team to watch and learn from,
but if I dive at a couple of his
(Krug’s) age-group practices, my
spirit picks up and my fears dimin-
ish,” Nordheimer noted.

Krug coaches an age-group div-
ing team in the evening after his
coaching of Pitt’s divers in the
afternoon.

“His age-group team has nation-
alists as young as’l3,” Nordheimer
said. “I like the pressure of wanting
to do better than they, yet I also like
the relaxation of being around
them.”

Krug lets. his male and female
divers help coach his age-group
practices. This way, his divers get
to watch others and their faults so
they can better see the faults they
may have.

Nordheimer is shooting to place
within the Top 16 in the East thi:
season, even if it involves some
pain to get there.

“Sometimes you shoot out just a
bit early, or lean back too much on
the takeoff, and you land flat on
your back," he explained. “But it is
then that you learn the most. You
have to get right out and do the dive
again. I wouldn’t have gone from
nothing on three-meter to a college
list, including a two-and-one-half
reverse, if I'd let a couple bad dives
scare me from trying more.”

Having originally joined Pitt’s
diving team for the fun of diving
and feeling of accomplishment the
sport gives him, he now has an
additional motivating factor-
helping last year’s Eastern Cham-
pion Pitt swimming and diving
team defend its title.

With facilities such as Pitt’s and
a coach such as ‘Krug, Nordheimer
is achieving the control he needs to
overcome the pressures of being the
Panthers’ one—man diving team.

A Ujevich Ta

on a recuiting trip, Ujevich
decided on Florida. A

“I felt a change might be
good for me,” Ujevich said.

Unfortunately for Ujevich,
the change didn’t turn out as
she expected. Despite being an
All-American swimmer in five
events (l00- and 200-yard frees-
tyle and the 200-yard breast-
stroke) at Florida, she was not
satisfied with her progress.

“It was a combination of a lot
of things,” Ujevich said. “The
coach trained the team as a
whole, not as individuals. I told
the coach during the AIAW
championships that changes in

'  my training would help me, but

‘he didn’t do anything.”

Ujevich’s low point at Flor-
ida was after the 1980 Olympic
trials in Calfornia. When she
tried out in 1976, she finished in
the top six at the breaststroke.
However, after a poor perfor-
mance in the 1980 trials, Uje-
vich made her decision to leave
Florida.

“At the airport, I told the
coach that things were not
working out for me,” Ujevich
said. “When I returned to Flor-
ida, I made my decision to
leave.”

Since Pitt was the only school

with the Aquatic Club, she
returned to the more familiar
confines of Trees Hall. Despite
her disappointments at Florida,
Ujevich still believes the expe-
rience was worth it.

“I don’t regret the decision,”
Ujevich said. “If I would have
gone to Pitt first, then I would
have wondered how it would be
like at Florida.”

career next season.

Returning to Pitt still didn’t
satisfy Ujevich at first. Despite
earning All-America honors in
the 100-yard freestyle and the
100-yard individual medley,
Ujevich was having problems.

“I started out really fast dur-
ing the early part of the season,
but towards the end I was slow-
ing down,” Ujevich said. “This
was due to my lack of a good
attitude towards swimming. I
gained 30 pounds. No matter
how strong you are, you are
going to slow down gaining
that much weight.”

In fact, due to her bad attitude
towards swimming, Ujevich
even had thoughts of quitting,
despite her past success.

“This summer, while train-
ing. with (men’s coach) Fred
Lewis, I felt I needed a break,”

te her great success n swimming, Pitt’s Jan Ujevich 6:

Ujevich said. “This summer I
took a month and a half break,
which was long enough to redi-
rect my goals in swimming. I
made up my mind to change my
attitude. I told myself, ‘Hey, I
only have two years left in
swimming, make the best of
IL,”

Another thing that has
helped Ujevich this year is the
arrival of Dr. Dave Belowich as
head coach.

“Coach Belowich is very
individualistic about his
swimmers, which is beneficial
to me and the other swimmers,”
Ujevich said. “I think him com-
ing in is beneficial to the team.
His enthusiasm and new ideas
have really helped out. He tries
hard to make the training var-
ied. We did some running,
which is excellent for training,

and we do Nautilus lifting,
which has increased my
strength.”

While Belowich was coach-
ing at Florida State, he got his
first look at Ujevich and was
duly impressed.

“When she swam against
Florida, she was doing a nice
job," Belowich said. “I heard
she was a dominant force in
high school swimming and
ironically I was interested in
working with her as a coach.”

Belowich said Ujevich’s suc-
cess is due to her strength, both
physically and mentally.

“Probably her biggest asset is
her mental aspect, although the
Lord blessed her with a strong
body,” Belowich said. “She is
very tough and competitive and
will do anything in order to
win. She is consistent in work-
outs and she seldom misses one.
She is in as good condition as
anyone on the team.”

After her own bout of indeci-
sion toward swimming, Uje-
vich has turned toward
motivating her teammates this
season.

“She doesn't talk a lot about
her leadership role. She leads by
actions. Many times she stays
after practice to help out other
members of the team,” Belo-
wich added.

An example of Ujevich’s
changed attitude is her

ton meet, where she broke
school records in the 50-yard
freestyle and the 100-yard
breaststroke and beat Princeton
All-America swimmer Char-
lotte Tiedemann.

“I was really psyched up for
the meet, because 'I wanted
revenge for the event that she

- beat me in at Easterns last year,”

Ujevich said. “I was nervous
going into the meet, but I,per-
form better being nervous. It
was a nice feeling. I was never as
keyed up that much last year.”

Although she still has more
than a year left in her collegiate
swimming career, Ujevich
doubts she will pursue swim-
ming after college.

“Swimming has been enjoya-
ble, but after 10 years of it, I
would like to try something
else,” Ujevich said. “I don’t
think I will try out for the 1984
Olympic team.”

The highpoint of Ujevich’s
swimming career came, she
says, when she finished first in
the 200-yard breaststroke in
East Berlin, Germany, as part of
a United States national team.
She enjoyed going against the
world’s best in that European
tour, but she admits winning at
Nationals, her current goal,
“may be more exciting.”

An old saying states, “You
can never go home.” Jan Uje-
vich has disproved that state-
ment emphatically.

Dupre nixes Pitt...

Marcus Dupre, generally consid-
ered one of the nation’s top high
school football players last season,
has apparentﬁr eliminated Pitt
from his list of prospective
colleges.

The .6-2, 220-pound running
back from Philadelphia, Miss. says
he has narrowed his choices to
Texas, Oklahoma, Southern Mis-
sissippi and UCLA. Earlier this
week, Dupre had announced he“
would sign a letter of intent with
Texas, but his mother later vetoed
the decision. Dupre now says he
and his mother will discuss his

options and choose a school
together. Texas is still in. the
running.

Because of his size and speed,
some scouts have called Dupre the
second coming of Georgia’s star
tailback Herschel Walker. In his
hometown, Dupre has been
honored with billboards, signs,
and recently, a “Marcus Dupre
Appreciation Day.”

Sherrill spoofed...

Ex-Pitt football coach Jackie
Sherrill’s unprecedented $51.5 mil-
lion salary to coach and serve as
athletic director at Texas A8cM has
caused ripples throughout the
sports world.

While Sports Illustrated and sev-
eral other national magazines have
examined the implications of Sher-

rill’s high salary and A8cM’s
methods in hiring the former
Panther coach, the sports-oriented
comic strip “Tank McNamara”
has been parodying the obvious
importance the Aggies have placed
on football.

Recent strips have depicted the
A&M Board of Regents discount-
ing the importance of building a
new library since the construction
won’t be completed until after
recruiting season, and assuring the
university president he’s in charge
of decisions such as building satel-
lite campuses but not more impor-
tant tasks such as hiring a new
coach.

Try as they might, A8cM still
can’t shed the onus of those Aggie
jokes. ’

‘he says, in his heart, he does not

‘Matey said in a phone conversation

 The sigh which punctuated the

of the decision Matey has wrestled
with inconclusively since Sherrill
left Pitt nary a fortnight ago.
The-dilemma; join Sherrill, a
man who Matey has spent all 14
years of his collegiate football

at A8cM to check out his prospec-

pitch, which Matey expects to
include a job coaching the A&M
defensive line, a part-time post like
the one he currently holds at Pitt.

Matey will, however, talk to
Sherrill by phone, and fully
expects his old mentor to be per-

 

Everybody’s hair needs a friend to lavish attention to its detail
and shape-—a friend who is always there if you’re thinking of a change

suasive, even if he is miles away on
a recruiting trip. '
“I know Jackie. We’ve been
together so long, it’s like having a
partner—you know how they’re
gonna turn, how they’re gonna
move,” Matey said. “Yeah, Iknow
Jackie. It’s going to be tough 
If the past is a prelude, a betting
man would wager on Matey’s relo-
cation to College Station, just as he
has followed Sherrill from Iowa
State to Pitt, then refused Johnny
Maj or’s offer to coach at Tennessee
to welcome Sherrill back to Pitt in
1977. Even Matey admits that“peo-
ple just automatically thought
when Jackie left, I’d go with him.”
Some published reports quoted
Sherrill as saying Matey would
accompany him , an error Matey
shrugs off byexplaining, “Some-
times Jackie does my thinking for
me. Iguess hejust assumed. . .we’ve
been together a long time.”

Still, Matey maintains that,

long-time loyalty aside, he is “a lit- ’

tle older now, a little smarter” and
presumably, a little more set in his

681-9243

ways. Matey repeatedly insists he
hopes to stay at Pitt and would not
leave unless he had the chance to
move upward, not laterally. He
also stressed his deep affection for
his current defensive line charges,
especially starters Bill Maas, J.C.
Pelusi and Dave Puzzoli.

“I’m hiding from them. I don’t
know what to tell them. You
become attached as you work
together so much,” Matey said.
“It’s just tough—damn tough. It’s
almost as if they become your kids.
And besides, they may beat me up
or something if I see them”

With that thought, Matey man-
agedone of the rare laughs in an
otherwise melancholy conversa-
tion. After talking with Fazio on
Monday, a meeting apparently
highlighted by each man trying to
convince the other that, yes, Matey
owed it to himself to check out the
Aggies’ offer, Matey left for A8cM
with Fazio’s blessing.

“FOge and I have known each
other a long time too,” Matey said.
“It’s tough. I had to choose

between (Johnny) Majors and
Jackie in ’77, and I have to choose
again, between Jackie and Foge
now.”

For a moment, Matey paused
thoughfully, then added, “You

know, most people think Jackie’

and I don’t care much fOr.each
other because we fight too much.
Neither of us are the kind of person
to back down. A lot of people were
suprised to hear he wanted me to go
with him.”

Matey stopped to chuckle again,
then continued, “But at least I
didn’t get fired this season. Last
year I got fired on the sidelines a
couple of times. Quit a couple
times too,” Matey added, some-
what proudly. “That’s the kind of
conversations we have on the side-
lines. Through the years, you learn
to respect a man like that.”

Respect—-it’s a sentiment Sher-
rill and Matey obviously share for
each other, as their long-time assow

ciation seems to show. Whether the " it

partnership will continue or not
should be known by tomorrow,
according to Matey, when he con-
cludes his visit to A8cM.

_“I’ll be back here Thursday
night. I’ll make up my mind by
then.” he said. “I’d like to stay
here.”

Still, something in Matey draws
him to A&M and pushes him into
fits of uncertainty as he agonizes
over his pending decision, a choice
between friends that he'd rather not
make.

. “Then again,” Matey said and
sighed. “I guess it’s better than no
choice at all."
