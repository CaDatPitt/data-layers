ESP Called Sensitivity

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
Staff Writer

The man billed as “Mr. ESP”
and “The Amazing Kreskin" is not
the mysterious person that one
would expect. Instead. he im-
presses one as being quite nor-
mal; a man with an inexhaustible
supply of energy and a ready
laugh, a congenial person who
knows well his business. ESP lex-
trasensory perception).

At 34, Kreskin is one of the
forerunners in his field. He is co-
editor of the magazine Fitness for
Living and has appeared on 38
Mike Douglas Shows and also did
numerous guest shots on the Merv
Griffin Show and the Johnny Car-
son Show. He also has his own syn-
dicated television program.

In a Pitt News interview, Kres-
kin spoke of himself as “a conser-
vative in an extravagant field." He
doesn’t claim to possess superna-
tural talents but attributes his
abilities to an advanced form of
mind communications. He be-

lieves that everybody has the
same powers as he does. After a
pensive moment, the slight man
smiled and said, “It usually man-
in tragedy.

should it be limited to this? It
shouldn't."

Kreskin later mentioned that
ESP can occur when a group of
people reach a common point of

-sensitivity. He hopes that one day

the initials, ESP, will be revers-
ed with the letters PSE, represe-
senting Phenonoma Scientifical-
ly Explainable.

“Of course there has been com-
mercialization,“ stated Kreskin,
“but it is no longer a kooky inter-
est. There is experimentation at
every level of society . . . but lab
tests are not really good. They are
too restrictive. A lot of perceptive
ability on an unconscious level is
lost. A lab is too cold; it drains it-
self of the human quality. . . . Peo-

inspired. Unfortunately. things
can't be controlled outside of a
lab.“ '

Kreskin has definite ideas as to
what the term ESP encompasses.
"I don‘t think that ESP is one spe-
cific thing. It's many things." He
prefers to think of telepathy as a
special form of sensitivity. “I also
avoidvthe term psychic. I don’t be-
lieve that there is a specific state
called hypnosis. Hypnosis has
been extracted. It is no longer con-
sidered a part of ESP."

In an article he wrote for The
Sign, a national Catholic maga-
zine, Kreskin said, “I don’t hypno-
tize people any more—haven’t now
for three or four years—because
it finally dawned on me that there
is nothing on earth that you can do
with a person hypnotized that you
can’t do with him wide-awake.”

ESP Called Sensitivity

Seances (spiritual communica-
tions with the dead) are also not
included in Kreskin‘s concept of
ESP. "Even if spiritualism did
exist," noted Kreskin, “there is no
way of proving it. It can be ex-
plained by telepathy. If something
is already known then it can be at-
tributed to either clairvoyancy or
telepathy. I don’t believe that
seances evoke any spiritualiza-
tion. They are held in dark rooms;
the people become nervous and
they lose their sense of percep-
tion.

Prophecy~—a la Jeanne Dixon-
like hypnotism, seances, and re-
incarnation is discredited by
Kreskin. He spoke of the impossi-
bility of predicting future events,
adding that if one becomes aware
of governmental (or other) infor-
mation, the chances of making a
right guess are enhanced. “We
tend to remember what prophets
say that comes true," warned
Kreskin.  . . I like to think that
she’s (Jeanne Dixon) a sincere

person, but out of her ten major

predictions last year, not one of
them came true.”

What Kreskin does believe in
can be put into two words: mind
communications. He is able to
both send and receive thoughts in
his quest for awareness. “We all
can make different paths to reach
the point of awareness: Zen Bud-
dism, self-hypnosis, prayer . . .
but people expect too much. There
is a tremendous amount of absorb-
tion and study that is necessary
to reach this point and most peo-
ple are not willing to involve them-
selves to the extent that is need-
ed."

  To You, The Student

About Our Pitt News

, So now I, Don Marbury am editor of the Pitt News. What
does it mean? Will the paper change? What do I see as the
paper’s purpose? '

The Pm News is one of, if not the most important student
organization on campus. Contrary to many of our critics might
say we are useful. We are very much needed. Without us this
campus would have a tremendous void. Itmay sound patronizing
4. for me to say it because this phrase has been used by organiza-
 tion heads just to hide their real desires of complete control, but
I I’m going to say it anyway. The Pitt News does not belong to me;

to the other editors and staff members; or to any administrative
office. The Pitt News, more than to anyone else belongs to you,
the student. We are your student newspaper. We are dedicated
to printing the news which concerns you. In essense you are the
Pitt News, because without you we have no reason to exist.

We are one of the greatest student newspapers in the coun-
try. You don't think so, do you? Well let me acquaint you with
some facts about the Pitt News. In the last Pi Delta. Epsilon
(the National journalism fraternity) writing contest held last
year, Pitt News articles literally swept the competition. The
staff captured six of their national editorial and newswriting
honors—more than any other college newspaper. And we don’t
have a school of communications or journalism, like all of the
143 Pi Delt chapters that entered the contest had. ’

THE NEWSPAPER was cited by the Associated Collegiate
Press as an All-American award winner for the Fall Term, 1968-
69—the second consecutive term.

.Following the Western Pennsylvania Collegiate Press Associ-
ation contest in 1968, The Pitt News earned 13 individual awards-
more than twice as many as any other college newspaper. And in
the 1969 contest, held recently the Pitt News equaled that re-
cord of 13. ' I

And that’s the paper that you’ve been wiping the mud off
your shoes with, been wrapping your lunch scraps in, and been
littering up Fifth Avenue with; all without even reading the
paper.

I CAN'T emphasize enough how important the student at the
University of Pittsburgh is to the Pitt News. You determine many
of the types of things you see in the paper. When you want to
see changes or alterations in your paper, don't write us a letter
simply saying, “the” Pitt News Sucks". Tell us what about
‘the paper makes you feel this way. If you think the paper is
fine as it is, tell us why you think this also.

Well, enough of this. Since you’ll be reading editorials by
the editor, I think I should give you a brief idea about myself
and how I think so you’ll be prepared as to whether you will
be writing letters agreeing with me, or going out to find little
dolls, in my likeness that you can stick pins in.

Look at the picture at the top of the column. For those of you
who didn't know, surprisel! That's right, I’m Black. Concerning
Black and White people, I believe that neither race has time to
go around hating one another, and putting their main emphasis
how to deal with each other. There's too much to be done, baby.
for that. People have to be mainly concerned with erasing the
brainwashing, to end all brainwashings, that they have undergone
in this country.

I COULD go on and on about each little individual thing

I which I am concerned with, but space just won't permit it. But

-, just keep reading your student newwpaper, The Pitt News. You‘ll

' see your new editors viewpoints, those of the staffs, your on.

plus features, news stories, analysis, reviews, sports, pictures,

debates, supplements, and a host of others, all contained in The
Pitt News 1970-71, a great student news paper. ‘

A Public Thanks

by jerry gruebel
former associate editor

As a concerned student at the University of
Pittsburgh, I find myself unable to disregard one
particular supposed -administrative problem_ as
out-lined by the former editor of The Pitt News
David Tiernan. In Part III: Final Gripes, which
appeared in The Pitt News Friday, March 6, Tier-
nan called for the dismissal of the Director of
Student Publications Mrs. Esther Kitzes.

Tiernan suggested that the problem is a “small
and very personal one, but one which affects
many students”. And that “the Director of Stu-
dent Publications has grown disgusted with the
attitudes of both students and fellow administra-
tors”.

That Mrs. Kitzes has grown disgusted with the
attitudes of both students and fellow administra-
tors may very well be true. She has been witness
to a rather ludicrous minority group of concerned
students, an alarming Silent Majority of pacified
students, and a rather quantitative number of do-
little or do-it-slowly administrators caught in bur-
eaucratic processes." But dissatisfaction with"the
existing conditions at the University appears to
_be a rather inadequate reason for dismissal.

SUCH REASONING BRINGS T0 MIND slo-
gans directed at disenchanted American citizens.
Like, “If you don’t like it leave." Should Mrs.
Kitzes be dismissed because she doesn’t like what
is happening on campus? I think not.

Mrs. Kitzes, despite her»-dissatisfactions, has
remained more than sincerely concerned with
those students directly affiliated with student
publications. And what is more, she has remain-
leg a benefactor in the process involved in the
p oduction of student publications.

That, as the former editor of The Pitt News
suggested, the problem is a “very personal one”,
may very well be true too. There was a very de-
finite lack of communication between the Editor
and the Director of Student Publications during
this entire past year.

But who’s to blame? I could not begin to
count the number of times Mrs. Kitzes stopped me
and asked, ?‘Wliere is David?” And yes, by the
winter term the questions were worded a bit more
sarcastically. Like, “Where is the Editor?” Or,
"Where is Mr. Tiernan?” Or, “Who’s running The V
Pitt News?”

AND THAT f‘the replacement of Mrs. Kitzes
with a younger person who is more familiar with
thefinancial aspects of student publications would
benefit the entire University” may very well be
true too. If you believe that younger people are,
by definition, more beneficial than older people.
And if you actually believe that Mrs-. Kitzes, as
former Business Manager -Burton Hirsch also sug-
gested, offers little in terms of “professional
advice”

But does the former editor of The Pitt News
know what and how vmuch the Director of Stu-
dent Publications has to offer‘? ‘I tend to doubt
that. It appears, rather, that Mr. Tiernan has
been misled as a result of the control with which
the former business manager handled the busi-
ness matters of The Pitt News.

. I am asking for no apology from either Mr.
Tiernan or Mr. Hirsch. I simply wish to disagree,”

‘and in doing so, public-ly thank Mrs. Esther Kit-

zes for her somewhat unrecognized contribution
to student publications. ‘

Williams--True Rcicliccil

  

by RUSS TRUNZO.
Contributing Writer

Robert F. Williams is one of
the most advanced revolutionary
activists in the United States. '

Like the Panthers, Williams
was persecuted for his militant
stand. Officials in Monroe, North
Carolina —- where Williams and
other Blacks had formed a rifle
club — were afraid to deal with
him in the normal means, so they
turned to the system they use
when ‘ ‘murder and summary
lynchings are too distasteful —
they brought him into court.

During one of the nights of
demonstrations in Monroe,
Williams had kept a White
couple in his house for three
hours, apparently for their own
protection. The so—called law
enforcement people of Monroe
pressured this couple until they
brought kidnapping
against Williams. Knowing that
no Southern court would find

him innocent, Williams» fled to.

“The Crusader,” and broad-
cast a radio program called Ra-
dio Free Dikie, which was

charges ~

,bearned_ at _Black,.. people,» in the '-

  
 
 

Both the newsletter and the
radio program were pioneers in
urging Black people in this
country to defend themselves-
including instructions on organ-
izing and building defense
mechanisms of all sorts.

After a time Williams went ’

to China, where hecontinued to
publish The Crusader, then he
traveled throughout much of the
world, finally returning to the
United States last fall in a bliz-
zard of ‘world headlines gener-
ated by the refusal of commer-
cial airlines to- fly him “for
fear of. being hijacked.”

Williams, together with a num-
ber of people, including Betty
Shabazz (Malcolm X’s -widow)
and Milton Henry (Detroit
Lawyer) has formed the Re-
public of New Africa organi-
zation, whose long range goal
is. the establishment of a separ-
ate Black nation in five southern
states. They intend to take those
states by force if necessary.

Not since the emergence of
Malcolm X has any one person
or organization caused so much

. upset and soul-searching among

the self-styleyd radicals and lib-
erals who masquerade as revo-
lutionaries in this country today.

The negro and white liberals
have hurled all the standard epi-
thets at Williams:

“He’s a racist" (anyone who
was born and raised in this
country and says he isn’t some
kind of racist is either a vege-
table or a liar)‘

“He's suicidal” (being will-
ing to give your life for what
you believe inonly seems sui-
cidalto cowards )-

“In this country it’s self-
destructive for Blacks and White
radicals to have guns” (the only
person, who wants .an unarmed
public"‘«' is ~ a . wolf, that Wants‘ .to

lunch

make us his

   

 

. only . , 

       
   

“He’s a CIA agent” (that’s why
he was well-received in Cuba,

China, Algiers and Tanzania and

put in jail in England).

When you take all the fancy
language and political ‘rhetoric
away, what it comes down to is
that Williams is a genuine rev-
olutionary, and he’s come back
to a country in which many of

_the people who call themselves

 

Sr

 "°"‘ M9» ""3 E'"t°' InDefense Of Mrs. Kitzes 

revolutionaries are stone phonies .

—and they know that eventually
the spirit Williams represents
will blow their game in the
Black community.

Many ofi.us who knew about
and admired Williams in the past
were afraid that he wouldn’t
be willing‘ to emerge as a leader
in this country now. But recent-
ly he appeared at a Black Pan-
ther rally in Detroit and said:

‘.‘Many people have tried to _f4-5‘

bring division among us. We‘

have been divided into groups.”

“We have been divided in_to
all ‘kinds of nationalists : cultural
nationalist, Marxist-Leninist
nationalists, Blacks and Whites,
and all kinds of things. But the
thing that is most important
now is unity, because through
unity we can find strength, and
through strength we can have
power, ‘and with power we can
do anything. . .I came here to
show my support for /the Pan-
thers and for the decent people
of America, no matter what
organization they may belong to,

“But I‘ know that we have a

as’

common struggle, and I’m _liap- 

py to come and to identify with
the honorable people in America
tonight. And ‘I'd like to say in
closing that I look forward ,to
working with the decent people
in America, no matter who they
may be.” _ '
Robert Williams is a true rev-

olutionary activist, as are Huey
P. Newton and William “Preach-
erman” Fespermann. The United
States is now engaged-‘in a revo-
lution, and Robert Williams has
returned to be one of the lead-'
ers of that’ revolution. — “arid if

How Our Readers See It

Are You 30 Different From The Others, Dave?

The Pitt News:
Open Letter to Dave Tiernan,
Dear Former Editor:

I was moved to write to you af-
ter reading your first“farewell”

. editorial (March 4) and confirmed

in my intention by your second one
in which you listed me as a re-
spected teacher. I respect you too,
as I think you know, and so my cri-
tiscism of your editorial on Pitt
students is not meant to be des-
tructive.

You have looked atPitt students
and found them for the most part
plastic, status conscious, corrupt,
unwilling to resist the draft, home-
towners with second rate educa-
tions, husband seekers, and scar-
ed—above all, scared. Sure, you
can find all those characteristics
without looking very hard, and I
agree with you that they are char-
acteristics which don’t auger well
for America in the ‘ decades to
come.

But have you gone the next step
and considered how many of these
traits you (and I) can still find in
ourselves, and how recently you
have probably become aware of al-
ternative ways to face life? Aren’t
you scared part of the time? ‘Don’t

you still find yourself responding‘

to status without thinking? Don’t
you wonder how_ plastic you may
still find yourself? I think we all
do.

Further, then, can’t you see the
potential in most of the Pitt stu-
dents to find direction and cour-

conditions under which they can
become strong, creative, individ-
uals capable of dealing with the
tremendous problems we all face

that; many more will. It’s too easy

by JERRY MYERS

 Nine tired mermen returned
home after three full days of com-

finish 18th out of the 36 schools
_,,that‘ entered.

j top ten was David Wessel. Wessel
, captured sixth place in the one-me-

that Wessel dove better than his
tally indicates, but “he just didn’t

in the low board event and 11th in
the high.

The over-all winner of the meet
was Yale University. Yaledecided
to compete and had little trouble
winning the contest. Yale will not
go on to the Nationals, though, in
accord with a ruling by the NCAA
which prohibits them from com-
peting in any NCAA tournaments
this year.

Other top finishers at Hanover,
N. H., last week were Princeton,
Navy, and Dartmouth. Villanova
finished high and Syracuse broke
into the winner's circle when their
sophomore flash Brian Crouse
captured the 1650 freestyle event.

The meet was almost,complete-

- ly dominated -by the Ivy League

schools with Syracuse being the
only outside independent breaking
into the limelight.‘ The best Pitt
could do in the swimming events
was 14th in the 400 yard freestyle
relay event and Rick Rowe’s 18th
in the “1650.”

Coach Grant had no regrets
though. “I was hoping that Morris
could get in there and we also had
a goodoutside chance in the relay,

1 Swimmers Finish 18th    

but we just didn’t have enough. As
it was our freestyle relay time of
4:23 was two seconds better than
our seeded time.”

Individually the mermen made
a good showing. Rick Rowe shat-
tered a Pitt school record with his
time in the 500-yard freestyle and
Mark Cohen did a “really good
job” in the relay. “He turned in
his best relay time, and Al Morris
had a good time in the IM.” '

According to team manager
Barry Simon, Tommy Hayes re-
corded a time of :22.73 in the 50
yard freestyle event but failed to
match his best time in the 100
yard ‘race. / ‘

Coach Grant further announced. 0

that the freshman ruling that pre-
vailed for this season will stay in
effect -for 1971. This means
that againthe tankers will have to
bow to the wishes of their oppon-
ent as to whether freshmen can
swim or not.

Pertaining to the condition of
the mermen after three days of
hard competition, Coach Grant

commented, “After all, they’re ~~
. just normal guys.”

e For Fifth In Easterns
  Mark Payne Finishes

Second In 142-Class

by SHEP GOLDBERG
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.—Before it began, the 15,000 wrestling
fans who attended the 66th_ annual Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling
-Association Championships were in general agreement regarding the
Pitt team. Even the headline in Thursday night’s paper read: “Pitt—

One Year Away from Contention.”

2:‘

Everyone felt that ‘despite the fine 10-4 record compiled during the I I
dual meet season, the Panthers would not have the power to challenge
the other Eastern schools until next year.

The Pitt wrestlers left the talking to others and when the bodies
finally stopped falling at Penn State after a weekend of wrestling, Pitt
had placed three men in the finals and finished high in the team stand-

ings.
Mark Payne placed second at
142, Bob Kuhn came in third at

158, and Dave Wylie grabbed a ’

fourth at 134 to account for the
bulk of the Pitt scoring. The Pan-
thers earned 26 points and finish-
ed in a tie for fifth place with
Army. Last year’s grapplers fin-
ished in ninth with 22 points.

Navy, however, proved to be the
strongest team in the East as they
swept to their third straight’EIWA
championship in royal fashion.
The Middies scored a record 103
points and, won six individual

titles. Penn State was the only;

team to give Navy a challenge as
the Lions finished‘ second with 89
points and fourindividual cham-
pions. Between them, Navy and
Penn State controlled the ten
weight classes. No other school
could boast a champion.

Both- Kuhn and Payne scored '
impressive victories, in the two
_day affair. In the_quarter finals,

Payne demolished Keefe" of Penn

. Stat,e,—22-.8. It‘was_the most points,

scored by a wrestler in theentire
tournament,-Kuhn»_ won his first

- two matches-with-falls, one of only
five men to record-twin pins on

the first day. . -"

Kuhn’s second victory was es-
pecially impressive because he
was trailing 4-0-.late in the match.
With two minutes remaining, how-
ever, he brought down Stone of
Penn State and pinned. him with
his arm while almost on his back
himself. A

Delts Maintain Big Leadi

In Frat

by VINCE Di NARDO

Since last September the Pitt
fraternities have been involved in
competition for the “A" and "B"
League All-Sports trophies. There
is a lot of prestige for the winner
so the competition has been tough.

The hot competition continued
last Thursdaynight at Trees Pool
as the swimming events were held.

Seven events were held. In the
100 yard freestyle Phi Gamma
Delta took the honors with a time
of 48.4. Theta Chi placed second
and Pi Kappa Alpha showed third.

Bray (Theta Chi) won the 50
yard breast stroke with a time of
34.9. Two Phi Gamms, Depamplis
and Bolin, took second and third.

Natali of Delta Phi Epsilon won
the 50 yard butterfly with Kradel
(Pi Kap) and Brandtonis (the Phi
Gamms) claiming second and
third. These same three took the
individual medley in the same or-
der.
