City Council dedicated the month of Sep-
tember to engaging local students in the
political process before their meeting yes-
terday morning in the City-County Build-
ing, Downtown. The Council. declared this
month Student Civic Engagement Month.

'Togetheraw_i,th Pitt’s Student Govern- .-
ment Board and the Graduate and Profes- V
' sional StudentAssembly, city officials said

they hope Student Civic Engagement Month
will i_ncrease voter turnoutin November-’s
midterm elections. '

Pitt’s student governments, along with I

13 other universities in the city, will par-
ticipate in the effort by circulating voter
registration forms in dormitories in an
attempt to make registering a convenient
and easy task. A

At Pitt, the official kickoff for voter reg-
istration will be held at the beginning of

lawn at 8:30 p.m. Thursday. SGB and GPSA
will set up tables for students to register
to vote. I

Additional tabling will occur daily i
Towers Lobby as well as in front of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union throughout September.

Pitt students gathered Downtown

goalof bringing more voters to the polls in

many different places, itfis a1mostimpos-

’ sible notto get ourselves involved in the

political process,” said~Madeline Beyer, a

A sophomore communications major. _

Later this month, SGB and GPSA hope

‘ to hold a number of other political events,

including a potential gubernatorial debate
as well as a candidate forum in collabora-
tion with thePitt-College Dems and Re-
publicans.

“Traditionally, students are not seen as a
voting population, but if we do not vote our
voices will not be heard,” GPSA president
Nila Devanath said.

Patrick Dowd, representative council .

of District 7, spoke, at the mid-morning
council meeting. He,‘ too thought it was
important for students to play an active role
in the political process —— especially in a

resigns

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

Student Government Board lost another
member at its ﬁrst meeting of the se-
mester last night when Ali Noorbaksh
resigned his position over a disagreement
with the Board.

His resignation brings the number of
empty seats on the Board to two.

Noorbaksh said he is resigning “be-
cause certain things. were sacriﬁced for
the sake of expediency, and certain people
were brought in without full discussion
by the Board.” ’

“Some things upset me this summer,

the way the board brought in our new ad- _

visor [Director of Student Life and Asso-
ciate Dean of Students] Kenyon Bonner,”
Noorbaksh said at the meeting in Nordy’s
Place. “This isn’t the same Board I joined
last year. With that being said, I think
these are all excellent people and I fully
support this Board and their mission.”

SGB President Charlie Shull said he was
not fully prepared. to discuss the resigna-
tion, as neither he nor the other Board
members were notified of Noorbaksh’s
intentions before the meeting. Bonner
declined to comment saying he had not
yet spoken to Noorbaksh.

“I have to discuss this issue with Ali
before I can comment,” Bonner said fol-
lowing the meeting. “I wouldn’t feel com-
fgrtable otherwise.”

Shull said he did not discuss Bonner’s
appointment with the Board and thought

A that it could potentially be the reason
for Noorbaksh’s ‘resignation. The choice .
to appoint Bonner as the~new’SGB ad- , .

viser was made in -the interest of bring-
ing SGB closer to Pitt’s ad—ministration‘,

' Shull said.

-‘p‘Whereas the Board formerly operated

‘under the Cross- Cultural Leadership and

Development Ofﬁce, the shift to Student
Life will help us provide more services for
students,” Shull said.“‘I did not see this

tax would have levied a 1-percent tuition
tax on local students but was tabled after
public outcry.

Pitt and several other local universities
eventually agreed to increase public support
of the city, but details about the agreement
were not released.

To further connect the city government
to local universities, SGB and GPSA have
helped form the new Pittsburgh Student
Government Council to serve as an interme-
diary between students, council and Mayor
Luke Ravenstahl. The council consists of 10
student leaders from Pitt, Carnegie Mellon
and Carlow, among other schools.

Pitt’s goal, explained Devanath, is to
register 1,000 voters before the Oct. 4
deadline. —

“This month is a good time to get voters
registered, as students are just arriving on
campus and have the opportunity to get
involved as soon as possible,” said Stephanie
Hoogendoorn, a GPSA adviser.

That feat should not be impossible,
Devanath said, as Pitt is home to close to
30,000 graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents. I -

After Noorbaksh’s announcement, the

Board reviewed about 10 allocation re— »

explained the process through which

SGB will not host another election to I

replace former members Noorbaksh and
Phil LaRue, who resigned from the Board
this summer. Students interested in ei-

ther seat will instead be able to submit —

applications to be reviewed at a public
meeting, in accordance with the Board’s
constitution. »

During the meeting, Shull said he hopes
to have the applications available within
one or two weeks. The tentative deadline
for applications is Sept. ‘17, followed by
interviews Sept. 21. --

Shull said the appointment deadline
is Sept. 28. ' ' ,

“That gives the new members October
and November to serve, and they would
be allowed to run again for re-election,”
Shull said. I . '

EDITORIAL

‘stealthy’ is

Industry take note: Stealthy ﬁghter jets might
be worth the investment, but stealthy ﬁber
is not.

Trying to satisfy a burgeoning demand for
foods with fewer calories and greater nutri-
tional value, food manufacturers are adding’
“stealth ﬁber” to their products, according to
Reuters Health. While marketed to the public
as high in ﬁber and consequently as a healthy
diet choice, foods conminingthis additive com-
monly cause indigestion —‘ and consumers
shouldn’t let their GI tracts be misled. ,

This “stealth ﬁber,” or inulin, is a complex
carbohydrate existing naturally in bananas,
wheat and other foods, but since it’s found

in high concentrations in the chicory root,
industries can extract the inulin and use it
in processed foods. Labeled as chicory root
extract, oligosaccharideor oligofructose, the
inulin additive has sneakily crept its way into
everyday foods, especially meal—replacement
food bars.

And inulin’s creeping around has not ad-
vanced the collective quest for a healthier diet.
Cargill, Inc. conducted a study of 26 men and
women and found just 5 grams of one inulin
form and 10 grams of another could cause
serious gastrointestinal problems — like gas,
bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and con-
stipation — to germinate within the partici-

pants’ bellies. The wrapper might be pretty,
but not the ending.

Most people would agree with the thought
that ahealthy dietis a good idea. The issue here

. is whether they choose to act on their answer

and, of course, how they act. Making processed
food a dietary staple. has never been a proper
way to act. Not before and, although some
“high ﬁber” labels would like you to believe
otherwise, not now. i
Nutritionists have for years preached that
adding natural forms of ﬁber to your diet, like

~whole grain breads and pasta, helps speed

along the digestion process. So consumers
are taught to equate high ﬁber with nutritious

n’t always healthy

and nutritious with “I better buy more of that
stuff.”

Calling inulin-inﬁised foods “nutrient—en-
riched” falls short of false advertising— “high
ﬁber” means something totally different than
“healthier” — but it comes awfully close. The
fact is such marketing practices mislead the
honest consumer, someone who’s clearly trying

' to improve his dietary habits. ;

And with a scourge of obesity and diet-
related health problems sweeping the country
and driving up health care costs, the country
can’t spare a single one of these consumers
who wake up.and decide, “Yes, I will stgp the
rhetoric and start eating healthier.” I A

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN

 

Elections are important,

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 

According to some website that everyone
uses to cheat on homework, some of the
most important rights enjoyed by college
students include the right to party, the right
to sleep until noon and the right to vote. Of
these three, the right to vote is perhaps the
least understood. MTV and other networks
rely on top celebrities like Diddy and Ke$ha
to rock the vote, but surveys show that fewer
than one in 1,000 people, under the age of
30 have ever participated in an election that
wasn’t hosted by Simon Cowell. Given ‘our
commitment to raising consciousness, the
Moustache Column of America has decided
to produce a guide to the 2010 elections that
will inspire this apathetic Pepsi Generation
to put aside its Playstation 3 controllers and

» handheld poker games and cast its ballots

for change.

Government

There sure is a lot of it, isn’t there? And what
does it really do? Let us lay it out straight and"
true for you: Nobody knows. Those college
boys just sit up in their corner offices in the
capital city and crunch numbers. All day long,
they’re crunching numbers. But why? What

has the government ever done for you? Still, O

the government should do twice as much as
it does now, regardless of what that is. When
you’re voting this fall, in October or Novem-
ber or whenever people vote, you should keep
this in mind.

Taxes —
Taxes are one of the big issues in this elec-

tion. There are either too many of them or
too few —— it depends on the situation. Taxes
ﬁnance pork, which is what spending bills are
full of, and this leads to gridlock. Almost all
taxes are directed at the middle class, so you
should vote for any politician who promises
to reduce the burden on these long-suffering
people.

The economy

Boy oh boy, this economy! It sure isn’t like
it used to be, is it? Remember when a man
could earn an honest wage for an honest
day’s work? Things were a lot simpler back
then, when there wasn’t so much gridlock, a
decent hot dog cost less than 50 bucks and
people weren’t building all these mosques to
nowhere in Alaska.

Health care

Health care is atop problem for all of us. You
can’t even go to a hospital nowadays with-
out having to sign over the mortgage to your
house — and that’s just to get treatment for

the common cold. When you’re casting this -

vote of yours, make sure you vote for politi-
cians who promise to put our lazy scientists
to work developing improved health. The cur-
rent state of American health just isn’t cutting

. it, what with the indigestion, erectile dysfunc-

tion and hair loss We’re facing today. Once we
get this better health out there, we can just do
away altogether with the hospitals.

Tort reform

Most of us have heard the horror stories about
those greedy lawyers out there. Our courts
are overloaded with frivolous lawsuits while
the guiltiest criminals never even set foot in
jail. You need to vote for a candidate who

and you

will put a stop to that with some honest-to-
goodness tort reform.‘After all, do you really

i want a ﬁve-time child molester winning a pot T

of gold because he spilled some hot coffee
on his lap?

Gay marriage

Gay marriage is a hot topic these days, espe-
cially with the straights. Atﬁrst we thought
it was a great idea, butthen we realized that

- once gay people start marrying, there’s a good

chance they’ll take all of our eligible ladies.
Have you ever watched that show where gay
men teach those straight slobs how to dress
and maintain their ﬁlthy apartments? Once
gay men get out there on the dating scene,
straight men will have zero chance with the
world’s most eligible bachelorettes. Keep this
in mind when you’re casting that precious
vote. - -

Cola Wars

The Cola Wars have been raging since the G

19605, with no end in sight. Millions of un-

compensated survivors have claims for dam-

ages, ranging from people who experienced

mild stomach indigestion after drinking Co-

ca- Cola with Lime to the unfortunate few who

suffered post-traumatic stress disorder from

cPepsi’s covert Crystal Pepsi project. Since

you can only vote once, you should vote for a

candidate who is willing to demand account— A
ability from these evil corporations. ‘

Glenn Beck

It seems like Glenn Beck is everywhere, in-
cluding Washington, D.C., and your televi-
sion set. We think he’s running for president
against the various communist—socialist-
fascist—progressives who have been secretly

should too

running this country since Lincoln’s assas-
sination. Although we admire his ﬂattop and
chipmunk cheeks, we don’t want you to vote
for him. He’s crazy! ’

Governor of Pemisylvania

This is a hotly contested race between two
people of whom you’ve probably never heard.
One of these two people raised taxes on booze
in Pittsburgh, so as a good, self-respecting
college student you should vote against
him. We have it on good authority that his
completely unmemorable opponent is a real
sweetheart. V G

The issues that matter to college stu-
dents ’ '
If you’re like everyone else in the 18—to-24
demographic, you probably want legalized
marijuana, more lenient DUI laws and less-
sass from your parents. We’re sure there
are candidates who support these things,
so ﬁguring out who they are should be your
top priority.

If you’re wondering whom We’re going to
vote for, you’d better take alter Zach Galiﬁ-
anakis, and “Check yourselfbefore you wreck
yourself.” Why should we vote now and throw
our vote away? You get only one vote per elec-
tion, and We’re saving ours up for a contest

— that really matters: Celebrity Survivor. The

smart money is onjoey Fatone. _ ~

ART

Exhibit mixes nature and technology

Courtesy of Pittsburgh Filmmakers

Michael Sherwin uses social media to create art that comments on users’ relationships with nature.

447 Melwood Ave. «
Runs until Oct. 17

Monday through Thursday: 12-7 p.m., Fri-
day: 12-6 p.m. '

Michael Sherwin ﬁnds comfort in nature.. .

Growing up in southwestern Ohio, he
spent most of his time outdoors, and today,
when he isn’t spending time hiking, camping
or taking his young daughter for walks, he
channels his passion for nature into art.

But if you’re looking for photographs
of pretty sunsets or rolling hills, you won’t
ﬁnd them anywhere in his collection, titled
“Divided Sky,” at the Pittsburgh Filmmakers
Gallery on Melwood Avenue. Instead, you’ll
ﬁnd elements of nature mixed with something
many of us are much more familiar with: me-
dia and social networking.

The series ‘of prints titled “In the Clouds”
is a perfect example. i

Sherwin took daily photographs of the
sky behind his house and placed them side
by side. The photos each reﬂéct a certain
mood - some days the skies are bright blue
and scattered with clouds, while others are
overcast and dreary. Over the top of the clouds

ﬂoat yellow-printed Facebook status updates
of his friends, with lines like, “I hope today
doesn’t suck,” and,‘ “I should probably‘ get
out of bed.”

“They’re both sort of ‘updates’ but in an
opposite way. I guess it’s a subtle commentary
on contemporary social phenomenon; We
connect through wires, but are disconnected
with the outside world,” he said.

“In the Clouds” is one of the few pieces
with Sherwin’s original photography; the rest
are made up of images craftily pulled from
technology. A

To make the “True North Archive” se-
ries, he took tile-sized images from a foggy
webcam at the North Pole and placed them
together like a mosaic.

Similarly, for his piece titled “World Wide
Web,” Sherwin “virtually-circumnavigated”
the globe using Earthcam.com, a website that
hosts links to thousands of webcams across
world. While it took Magellan three years to
circumnavigate by sea, it took Sherwin only
one week to click on every webcam the site
had to offer. « -

“A lot of webcams I found were broken
or just deadpan pictures of "courtyards or
backyards. Some of them are still transmit-
ting images but you have no idea what you’re
looking at,” he said. '

‘He spent a day and a half creating a grid
on the wall with strips of adhesive vinyl to

represent lines of longitude and latitude and V

’ then placed selected images in respect to their

webcam’s geographical location.

Up close, it’s hard to tell what exactly the
fuzzy images of “World Wide Web” represent,
but after a few steps back, the photos take on
abroader meaning.

“After putting the images on the grid,
shapes of continents began to form  Eu-
rope had an abundance of webcams, but they

~ started to trickle off in Africa. It turned into

a social statement that I never expected,”
he said. ‘

In the gallery, next to “World Wide Web,”
lies the most epic piece of the exhibit: “It’s All
Relative,” a 5o—channel video installation of
a solar and lunar eclipse.

Unlike atypical ﬁlmmaker, Sherwin gath-
ered all of his material from YouTube. The
videos slowly appear on the wall, each one
chiming into the cacophony until it’s hard

to tell which shots are by amateur stargazers _

and which are by scientists.

But it’s not really thephases of the moon
that mystify him —— it’s the need human be-
ings have to connect with one another.

‘ “The phenomenonessentially becomes
ourfascination with this event, becoming
bigger than the actual eclipse itself,” he said.‘
“It also represents the ‘constant chatter’ we
experience every day.” _ ’ ' '

iiid college
cooking
dilemma

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

There’s a downside to coming out from under
your parents’ watchﬁil eyes and into the college
world of freedom — the necessity of feeding
yourself.

This might not seem so difficult until you’re
staring at the empty shelves in your pantry or
fridge, daunting displays in the grocery store or
pricey restaurant menus.

It can be tempting to buy entirely pre-made
or fast food, but cooking for yourself might be
cheaper, healthier and certainly yields a certain
satisfaction. V

Still, stocking a new kitchen from scratch
isn’t easy, cheap  or impossible. Acquire a few
basic provisions and you’ll be well on your way
to preparing a myriad of simple and delicious
recipes, requiring only an additional ingredient
here or there. _

A few spices and sauces are worth having
—— garlic can enhance almost any savory meal,
steak seasoning is more multipurpose than its
name implies, teriyaki is the transformative

ingredient in turning vegetables and meat in a

wok into a veritable stir-fry, and pasta sauce is

' self-explanatory. Don’t bother going all out on

afull set though. Items like tarragon, bay leaves
and other more obscure spices aren’t necessary
for most day-to-day cooking.

I If time, space and money are at a premium
in your kitchen, by all means enjoy fresh fruit
and vegetables, but for others, canned and fro-
zen foods are an accessible and nonperishable
option. For occasional fresh splurges, there is
a farmer’s market in Oakland at Sennott and
Atwood streets every Friday from 3:30 to 6:40
p.m. until Nov. 19, and other farmers markets
can be found around the city.

As for carbohydrate basics, rice and pasta
are good to always have in stock. Bread’s shelf
life can be increased by freezing it, which still
leaves it perfectly usable for toasting or thawing
out for sandwiches.

And for the time-crunched students who
need to stock their cupboards, a few cans of
soup won’t go amiss in a city with an intense
winter like Pittsburgh, but be on the lookout for
outrageously high sodium contents.

A way to save big is to use memberships to

can share just the basics like milkand eggs or

divide the entire grocery bill between you. The ,

key advantage to the last option is the ability to
cook for each other, say, once aweek. Wouldn’t
it be nice to come home from a long day in the
classroom to a home‘-cooked meal?

a Of course, most ofthis only applies to kitch—‘

ens with cooking‘apparat11ses and space for

kitchenette — basically differentiated from a

 appliances‘, with which ‘notevery st1‘1'4 T
dent living space is equipped. If you’ve got a ‘

kitchen by the lack of a stove and from a random
nook by the presence of a sink — your options
are restricted, but all is not lost.

A sink leads to messier creations requiring
immediate rinsing of dishes, like oatmeal. Check
with your RA before setting up any additional
appliances — you don’t want to be the kid who
got written up for having an illegal hot plate.

_ Then the last living accommodation pos-
sibility: The classic bed-and-desk set-up dorm
with only a mini—fridge and a microwave for
food preparation if you’re lucky. You’re going to
have a hard enough time storing your clothes
and belongings, let alone food, so enjoy your
meal plan and the occasional Easy Mac or ra-
men noodles. 5

It’s not that culinary creativity is impossible
in a dorm room — I’ve seen microwaved lava
cake —— but it can be unsafe and is almost al~
ways unpalatable. For instance, the lava cake:
an unsettling‘ creation that tasted vaguely all
right but strongly resembled a lunar landscape
in aesthetics and had the consistency of chewy
cardboard. So make microwave cooking and

Sherwin often ﬁnds that students, and even

himself, get caught up in the “constant chat— .

ter” of texting and computing. To escape the
clamor of everyday life, he offers a photog-
raphy workshop for aspiring student artists
injackson Hole, Wyo.

“We don’t just take pretty pictures. We look
for the connection between nature and cul-
ture. The goal is not to be negative — rather,
it’s to observe and ask ourselves what we think
of the world around us,” he said.

The workshop takes place nextjune, and
he encourages any interested college students
to apply.

Concerning his work at the Filmmakers

Gallery, Sherwin admits his use of appro-
priated images might seem mysterious and
ambiguous at times.

“I like that the viewer has to work a little
bit to try and make sense of the piece. Even
if they don’t always understand it, I’m enjoy-
ing the fact that some of the work is kind of
open—‘ended,” he said.

1 For those interested art lovers, Sherwin
will discuss his artwork and process at the
Filmmakers Gallery on Sept. 30 at 6 p.m., with
a reception following immediately after.

tography workshop go to http://art.ccarts.

THROWING A KIRSCH B LL

BCS allows for no missteps

MCT Campus

Boise State receiver Austin Pettis pulls down the game winning touchdown against Virginia Tech. But thanks to the BCS, evenan un-
defeated season might not be enough for Boise State to win a national championship. Pitt is already out of the picture after one loss.

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

 

In 2005, the North Carolina men’s basketball I

team lost its ﬁrst game of the season on the
road to Santa Clara; 77-66. _ I

This was the perfect cue for the cries of
“overrated” and accusations that the Tar
Heels were only ranked so high because
of their North Carolina pedigree. But after
their initial stumble, the Tar Heels went on
to have a pretty good season. ’

They won their next 14 games, lost only
three more the rest of the season and eventu-
ally took home a national championship.

Nobody was talking about Santa Clara
that April.

There are two morals to this story:

1. Pitt’s football season isn’t over.
Good things can still happen. Everybody
breathe.

2. I hate the BCS. It’s a little early in
the season for this rant, but Pitt’s loss just
brought up the feelings. ‘

First off, one loss doesn’t deﬁne a sea-
son — or at least it shouldn’t. Pitt can still

win the Big East and go to the BCS Bowl. A

season-opening loss against Utah doesn’t
end all hope for the elusive Big East title
that slipped through the Panthers’ ﬁngers
last season.

And if Pitt goes on to beat Miami at the
end of the month, odds are the loss to Utah
will be quickly forgotten. Pitt fans tend to
run extremely hot and cold that way.

But unfortunately for Pitt, the BCS system
doesn’t allow for missteps, not even early in
the season on the road against quality op-
ponents. The BCS doesn’t care that a team
that loses the ﬁrst game of the season might
end up being the best team in the country
by the end of the year. -

Now I’m hardly saying that Pitt is the
best team in the country. I want to make that
clear. I’m simply making a point: A_ team,
any team, shouldn’t have all hopes dashed
of winning a national championship because
of one early loss.

Sure, you can say that the bowl games
allow more than one team to go home happy,
but quick, who won the Roady’s Humanitar-

Pitt men
strong in
Duquesne
Duals  

Kelly Flanigan, J

Staﬁ Writer

..-For some students, running through Schen-

ley Park is simply recreation or exercise,
but on Saturday, the Pitt cross country
teams ‘ran through the park with higher
stakes.

The men’s and women’s cross coun-
try teams kicked off their seasons in the
Duquesne Duals with the men taking fourth
and the women placing eighth, both out
of ten teams. ' ,

After a disappointing performance at
last year’s Big East tournament — the men
finished 11th and the women finished last
out of 16 teams—~ this event was an op-
portunity for Pitt to come out and begin
anew. , '

The Saturday morning meet included
teams such as Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon,

Canisius, St. Bonaventure, St.]oseph’s, St.
Louis, St. Vincent, Xavier and Youngstown
State.

“I would give it an 8 for overall perfor-

-o

"as

mance on a 1—to—1o scale,” assistant coaches.

Clint Bell said.

Last year at the Duquesne Duals, Pitt’s
women’s team ﬁnished 5-2 in head-to-
‘head matchups. Junior Miyajohnson was
a key performer for the team in last year’s
race.

“Miya Johnson, who led the team last 

year, will deﬁnitely take her place among
the top of our squad as the season progress-
es, as well as Rachel Erny,” Bell said.

For the men, current seniors Joshua
Christopher and Teddy Miller finished in
the top 10 runners in last year’s race. Both
turned in great times again this year with
Millerplacing sixth at 25:44 and Christo-
pher placing 18th at 26:20. ,

As the men ﬁnished 6-3 in head-to-
head competition, two other Panthers

also placed in the top 25. Andrew Cerritoﬁ

Cross Country 4 7

ﬁnished 24th with 26:42. Vinnie DePalma
wasn’t far behind with a 27:12 finish. .

“The men’s team is still strong at the
top but lacks depth with Chase Broussard
not returning and Greg Kareis who is red-
shitting this cross country season due to
a back injury,” Bell said. “I am looking for
a sixth and seventh man to step up and
ﬁll a void.” A »

Bell speculated that these people may
be Dontave Cowsette and Wesley Washing-
ton, buthe will “know more as the season
progresses.” . _

“Kevin opened up one minute faster
than last season, and Cerrito opened
over a minute faster than last season,”
Bell said. .

College football only

ian Bowl last season?

Yeah, that’s what I thought.

[The list of BCS screw-ups and controver-
sies is long. Everybody remembers the split
national title between USC and LSU in 2003
and Auburn being left out of the champion-

. ship picture in.2004 despite an undefeated
season in the highly competitive SEC. .

For teams like Pitt, that play in confer-
ences not considered among the top in the
country, one defeat is all it takes for national
title hopes to slip away. _ ‘

Sometimes for those teams, even going
undefeated isn’t enough for a national cham-
pionship opportunity (see: Boise State 2007,
Cincinnati in 2009). ‘ '

The BCS just seems like a good way to

discourage teams from playing challenging .

out-of-conference schedules. .

The risk is greater than the reward when
it’s one loss and you’re out of the picture.
The BCS system doesn’t allow for upsets or
the idea that teams improve as the season
goes on. ,

But it should.

For the women, sophomore Ernily’Barno
and senior Carrie Mavrikis recorded per-
sonal bests to kick off the season. Barno led
the Panthers with a time of 19:42, shaving
almost two minutes off her time from last
year’s duals. . s '

“Elesia Wilson had a great opener
as a freshman, and freshman Susannah
Feinstein had a good opener as well,” Bell
said. ~

While the individual performances ‘
weren’t enough to earn the teama higher‘
place ﬁnish, they were enough to win Bell’s
conﬁdence. - ' ‘

The women won all seven of their head- A

to-head competitions, including knocking
off Carnegie Mellon bya narrow 28-27
margin. The women won their matches in
convincing fashion, defeating St._]oseph’s_
by 35 points. ~

“Everyone ran faster than they did last
year. This year’s team is a better team. The
upperclassmen are stronger, and the fresh-
men are a surprise. The team is young, and .
we have a lot of room for improvement,”
Bell said. '

The teams will run again at Schen-
ley Park on Sept. 18‘ in a tri—meet with
Duquesne and Bucknell. I

keeps the regular season exciting, but it’s
not very exciting when teams are hesitant
to schedule quality opponents for fear of
being left out in the cold — look at Penn
State’s schedule in 2009. '
‘ I, for one, found thosegames against
Akron and Temple absolutely thrilling.

In college basketball, teams play for
seeding throughout the season, and more

emphasis is placed on the end of the season ‘

when it comes time to make up the brackets.
Thecollege football season would remain
just as exciting if the teams were playing for
seeding instead of bowl games.

Think about it: What other major sport
decides the national champion without some
sort of playoff? Umm... - S. ‘ .

_ Imagine the excitement that college foot-
ball playoffs would bring: pitting the best
teams against one another to determine 0
a national champio.n on the ﬁeld, where
it. should be determined. ‘Instead, the two
contenders are determined by an odd com-
bination of polls and computers. _

It’s a good thing for North Carolina that
college basketball does things differently. [
