Government Day Features
Lingren, Party Spokesmen

By JIM DeWEESE

“Political aspirants must c

lose ranks and work for the

good of all. Cooperation from those who failed to win ofﬁce
is necessary for the effective operation of student govern-

ment.”
So said Dr. Vernon C. Li

ngren, associate professor of

education, in his keynote address before a small group of
student leaders last Wednesday. Placing the accent on stu-

dent leadership in school politics,
he stated that the groups (gov-
erning bodies) must “. . . move
' carefuly so that their programv
won’t be damned by rashactions
or leadership.” V
Party Chairmen Talk
Each of the three party chair-
men was slated for a four minute
talk. Dave Guyol, V.I.P. party
chairman, pointed up the fact
that for the first time in the
school’s history fraternities were
supporting independents and visa-
versa. He restated the party’s
aim in striving to place the best
students in office. I P
In line with this aim, Guyol
stated that there has been no
actual merger bctwen the V.I.P.
and Pitt parties. Rather the two
organizations have chosen simi-
lar slates in order to insure the
best possible student govern-
ment.

Due to the absence of party
chairman Joe Trattner, the Pan-
ther Party spokesman was Paul
Balles. Balles stated that, “This
is the time we can afford to make
mistakes.” He added the hope
that no animosities would result
over the campaigns.

Independents Needed

Paul Petro represented the Pitt
party in the absence of Bob Dick-
inson.lPetro stressed the need for
more recognition of independent

' students. He concluded that, un-

der the present regime, Greek
Week and Spring, Festival were
designed “predominantly” for the
fraternities and sororities leaving
only Religion-In—Life week and
perhaps registration for the unaf-
filiated students.

' The prime purpose of the one
hour session was to acquaint
present and future political
leaders with the functions of
government within the Univer-
sity. S. C. President Emil Her-
man called on each committee

dress, Dr. Lingren offered his,ad-

For High School
Publications Day

By JACK OLENDER.
The 1955 High School Pub-
lications Institute, to be held
Saturday, Mar. 26, at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, will be
attended by an estimated 1600

school journalists. The vari-
ous phases of editing and pub-
lishing will be discussed by high
school students under the chair-
manshi} of Pitt editors.

Awards will be presented to
the high schools submitting the
best student newspapers and
yearbooks for criticism. Miss Vir- ,
ginia Delp, President of the West-
ern, Pennsylvania School’ Press
Association, Dean of ‘Men Theo-
dore Biddle, Dr.“ D on a l d E.
Swarts, Director of Student Pub-
lieations, James DeWee-se, PITT
NEWS editor, and Alan Skirboll,
OWL business manager, have
been designated as principle.
speakers at the awards meeting.

Dr. Swarts sees great signific-
ance in the growth of the Insti-
tute from a 400 attendance at the
first Institute four years ago to
1400 ‘last year. It was originally
established by the late Robert X.
Graham, former head ‘of the De-
partment of Journalism, and Dean
Biddle. , -

“Since its inception it has been
beneficial to both high school and
the University,” Dr. Swarts fur-
ther observed. “It is the largest
student-sponsored effort which
brings outstanding high school
students to the University. Gen-
erally speaking, the sharpest high
school students are those who are
interested in newspaper and year-
book work.” ,

Co-chairman Skirboll and De-

Weese both expressed optimism

The entire faculty of the gradu-
ate School of Retailing, headed by
Dean Albert B. Smith, opened the
clinic with a panel discussion on
“Launching an Executive Career
Through the School of Retailing.”

Members of the panel, Pitt
alumni, presented their ﬁrst-hand

experiences in the business ﬁeld.‘

Doris Lienen, Gimbel’s buyer. and
Shirley Tanner and Howard Roth-

Lots Bought for

 

Medical School  

The ﬁrst step in the con-
struction of the Graduate
School of Public Health has
been completed. The Urban
Redevelopment Authority has
ﬁnished negotiations for the
land on which the proposed
building will stand.

L. W. Monteverde, president of
the Real Estate Company Ofpitts-

‘burgh, announced Monday that the

last of the 46 properties in the
Oakland area necessary for the
construction of the building has
ﬁ’nally been acquired. .

A starting date for construc-

,tion of the $5,000,000 building

has yet to ‘be announced. When
completed, the school will serve
as one of the key buildings in
the redevelopment program now
under way at the Medical Cen-
ter of the University. The ac-
quired properties form the block
bounded by Fifth Avenue, Bou-
quet, O’Hara and DeSoto Streets.

According to Monteverde, all of
the property owners involved in
the transfer realized that the land
would better serve the public in-
terest as a site for the expanding
Medical Center. The properties
included six commercial sites but,
according to the real estate presi-
dent, “All tenants were very co-
operative.”

Demolition has been begun on
the buildings now standing on the
tract. Almost all of ‘the present
structures have been razed.

Woman Prepares To Teach

Korean Takes Pharmocognosy

By JIM MARINO

Not even Syghman Rhee’s
presidential order could pre-

vent Chung Sook Parklfrom '

coming to the U. S. to study at
the Pitt Pharmacy School.

Miss Park stated that she was A

“caught in the middle” of
Rhee’s prohibition of examina-
tions in English which pre-
vented draft eligibles from
obtaining Visas.

She ﬁnally secured an as-
sistantship, however, through
the efforts of the Pitt Pharma-
cy School and the foreign student
advisor. She is now doing gradu-
ate work in pharmacognosy, the

study of drugs obtained from nat-’ "  ' —

ural sources.

According to Dr. Edward P.
Claus, professor of pharmocog-
nosy, the only'diﬂ"iculty which Miss
Park. has encountered in her
studies is" with the English lan-
guage. Although she is beginning
to think in English, she still can-

not keep pace with her rapid lec-

turers.

» Communists Stop Studies

With Dr. Claus acting as in-
termediary, Miss Park told of her
intermittent education at the Ewha
Women’s University in Seoul.
She recalled that during the Com-
munist occupation of Seoul, she
“had to stay at home,” unable to
attend classes.

Her father had to give up his
medical practice and go into
hiding, “because the Commun-
ists wanted to take all the edu-
cated people to North Korea.”

Before the second Communist
invasion of Seoul in 1950, Miss
Park moved to Kyung Sang Nam
Do, a province near Pusan. Tem-
porary facilities had been set up
in the city of Pusan by the Wom-
en’s University. .

Miss Park had no college text-

books when she arrived in the
U.S. Recalling her unpleasant re-
turn to Seoul, the 35 year-old
pharmacist said that her home had
been ransacked, the windows had
been broken, and everything had
been stolen, including the furni-
ture. '

Commenting on pharmacies in
Korea, Miss Park stated that
there were “fewer drug stores in
Korean cities than in the U.S.,
but Korean drug stores sold
only drugs and ‘sick room sup-
plies.” She was surprised to see
soda fountains and toys in the
super drug 'stores here.

Miss Park admitted .that her
choice of pharmacy as. a career

was inﬂuenced by her father and.

brother, both of whom are M.D.’s.
She .“did notwant to be a medi-
cal doctor,” but had a strong .de-

sire to study the sciences.

at Pitt, Miss Park hopes “to ‘return
to Korea and teach courses in
pharmacy.” ' 1 -

which originated a joint slate
composed of veterans, fraternity
men, and independent men and
women. These two parties feel
that student government should
have representatives of all groups
of campus life, stating that good
leaders cannot be found in one
group alone.

In their campaigning, the
Panther Party has blasted Stu-
dent .Congress laxity, -dema-nd-
ing explanation of wast e d
money and wasted time in SC.
Panther also has stressed pro-
gress which their party has
made in Men’s Council, as well

as class-sponsored activities.

The majority of the Panther
Party’s opinions have been'ex-
pressed in controversial hand-
out sheets, which have kept the
name “Publius” in campus con-
versation.

“Publius” Important
The stem‘ of this idea 6nce

early history of our country.
Alexander Hamilton, John Jay
and James Madison wrote many
articles in defense of a strong
centralized government and a
strong national constitution from
the period of October 1787 to
April 1788. These articles, which
appeared under the pseudonym
“Publius” in New York journals,
later were incorporated into the
famous “Federalist” papers.

Women at Pitt finally have
antactive say in elections. Pitt- C
V.I.P. slated. eight co-eds for
positions in SC. An equal num-
ber were to of run under the
Panther wing, but have wished
to be classified “independents”
for unexplained reasons.

The parties have only three school
days of campaigning to sell their
platforms to the voters. On Wed-
nesday the polls will'be open at
four locations; Commons Room,
Engineering School, Nurses School,
and Pharmacy School, from 9:30
a.m'. to 4:30 p.m.

With the innovations employed
to boost this year's campaign, a
record number of ballots cast
would be no surprise.

Annual Party Held

program with the annual Guild
party today from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m.

satiric sketches on school life, the
women will emphasize important
phases of extra-curricular activ-

apart from their parallel upper-
class activity. Under the present
revised system, co-eds participate
in recognized clubs, under the
advisorship of a guild chairman.“

However, to bring together

Five Meta Sequoia trees, similar

fully, “in 100 years.” .
Wants Ideas

One of his prime interests in his
new position is helping young
men and women. He encourages
new student ideas, “telling groups
frankly» when their plans are
rotten.” But he will sincerely
strive to effect a student plan
which he thinks is good.

Captain Fisher has always taken
time‘ off from his supervision,
whether over brooms or battle-
ships, to work with his wood
carpentry. “My wife even uses the
furniture I make,” he said proud-

His relation to the University’s
current building program is “go-

the University viewpoint.”

The physical plant head “really
hopes for an improved cafeteria.”

Student Congress Year Report

‘Highlights Pitt Chest Revision,

Discount Service, Damage Pact

Initiation of an Inter-Collegiate Council, a Student Dis-
count service, and the ‘revision, of Pitt Chest were some of
the highlights of the Amid-year report issued by Emil Her-
man, president of Student Congress, at a recent meeting.

The list of projects included achievements this year and

‘those carried over from the last Congress.

The Student

Union committee has been integrated into a largei group

composed of faculty and-adminis-6

tration, since the planning of the
proposed building.

‘Inter-City‘ Collegiate Council,
initiated by Pitt, was created to
achieve b e t t e r understanding
among the five local colleges and
is composed of their respective
student presidents. .

Student Discount Service, un-0

der the direction of Al» Boll, “has
made good progress” in obtain-
"ing .a discount for students of the
five local colleges. The project
has been carried out on the
strength of an extensive poll and
the rep orts of the committee
representing the five local col-
leges.

Negotiations to complete the
Damage Rally Pact are still be-
ing c_arried on, with Carnegie
Tech, the only holdout. It was
Tech that held up the pact dur-
ing‘ the last Congress.

P-itt Chest, headed by Jane
Pickering, was turned over to SC
this year to be revised, The re-
vision, eliminating divided au-
thority and administration, re-
sulted in an increase in total col-
lection and a decrease of ex-
penses.

Student Discussions

Helene Marino and her com-
mittee have held Student-Faculty
teas‘ and discussions to -further
cement their relations and have
now initiated a series of student
discussions in 151 C1. every Mon-
day, fifth hour.

Revival of the Panther, for-
merly a literary-humor magazine,
has been aided by a poll conduct-
ed by Tony Arabia and his com-
mittee. The newly proposed mag-
azine will be of a higher calibre
than the old effort, according to
the poll’s explanation.

Special free hour programs
such as last week’s variety show
are arranged by Paul Petro,
assemblies committee chairman.
Other program plans will in-
clude guest speakers, musical
and cultural programs.

Student Congress Day, on
Mar. 23, was planned to explain
to the students the function of
SC and encourage regular at-
tendance at meetings.

,_ Las.t;W_ednesday’s Student Government Day, poorly at.
tended though it was, ﬁlled a deﬁnite need, although time
V willhave to decide how effectively.

Dr. Lingren, the keynote speaker, put into words the
general concept of student government and how it must
function in order to best serve the student body and re-
main clear of administrative veto. _

Dr. Lingren pointed ‘' out that individuals as well as
groups must weigh their various ideas and views ca_refully
to avoid the damnation of their entire-party as a result of

’ rash actions" and leaderships.

Such points: as the demonstration by a party that they
are capable of servinggthe best interests of the University,
and the fact that political duties, no matter how menial,
must be assumed with the sincere trust and conﬁdence
vested in the office holder. ’

,— Dr. Lingren emphasized that for the effective opera-
tion of any political group a unity of purpose must be ar-
rived at following the election. Even those who fail to gain
oﬂice must “close ranks” and work for the common good.

Emil Herman stated that students gaining political of-
ﬁce should look upon their trust as a service rather than a
glory’-gaining honor. ' _

The political campaign is thus far lacking in several of
these aspects. At present,‘ the smears and accusations leave

some doubt as to the ultimate combining for the good of the .

student body. But primarily such a disorderly campaign
serves best to point ,up the shortcomings of its originators.

A Direct Service

. By Jim DeWeese
Two months ago the News ran a series of ed-
itorials and columns on the possibility of reinstat-

ing a student magazine at Pitt. The need was ”

then, and is now, clear. Since that time a format
for the proposed magazine has been compiled. In
addition, copies of magazines ranging in style from
the New Yorker to Cincinnati
Proﬁles have been gone over i
and checked for possible types
of material. These are the re-
sults of this survey. .

The proposed magazine would

long dead Panther. Style, make-
up, and content would be on a
higher level, a level guaranteed
by the editorial’ policy now be-
ing compiled for the magazine.

Humor would form a neces-
sary part of such a publication, but would be on
a level .which would credit University students,
rather than insult their intelligence. The New
Yorker contains one style of humor which can be
approached by student authors. The Saturday Eve-
ning Post devotes a full page to their “Postscript”
columns which again not only can be, but actually
have been, done by students.

“ The Perfect Squelch” is another-,Post feature
which has gained wide readership. Within the Uni-
versity there are hundreds of almost perfect
“squelches” delivered daily by harrassed students
or instructors.,And a good cartoonist would pro-
vide drawing comparable in quality to those found
in the Post, Colliers, and other such publications.

Dissipating With . . .,

 

All of this humor could relate directly to the Uni-
versity. _ '

The Reader’s Digest carries a brief column
called “Slips of the Tongue” in which mistakes in
newspapers and magazines are recounted for the
enjoyment of readers. This paper could supply
such to the magazine. I blush. »

Also to be found within the pages of the Digest
is a humorous feature titled “Life in These United
States.” Why not “Life in This University.” Such
incident as took place on the day ‘that a prom-
inent professor fell out of the windowof his ﬁrst
floor‘ class, or at the time another professor scaled
his text book through an open window on the 26th
ﬂoor would serve admirably in this capacity.

On the serious side of the page wesﬁnd the
creative and feature writing which now has scant
outlet in the University. Students of creative writ-

-ing would have the opportunity to have their short
stories published and read all over the city‘ and

beyond. A continued student novel could be in-
cluded in much the same style as the Post.‘

As for feature news articles, we need only look
at the confusion of the current political party sys-
tem to realize that a full length, detailed story on
elections wouldi aide not only the voters but also,
ironically enough, the politicians. ' -

‘And of course there is a constant need for‘com“-

.,plete stories on such men as Dr. Fitzgerald, Dr.

Liu, Dr. Peterson, etc. The list could go on indef-
initely. , . i
If the magazine is realized it will be more than

'a.student publication of exceptionally high ‘qual-

ity. It will be a very direct service to the Uni-
versity. ’ ‘

Panther Publiii  I a

By Joan Thomas
And now we» are back to the
mud-slinging days of Andrew
Jackson. The Panther Party has
gcome out with a Publius Number

from desperation, to slander of
individual personalities. So the
political p a r-

ties did not

sition-to unwilling readers.
Criticism of excellent ideas is

Politics Goes . . .

Underground

By ‘Judy Gotterer G

Some female students around
these parts are pussy-footing

. about .student politics, evident-

ly ashamed or afraid to support
their party platform openly by
releasing their names for public

' recognition.

They are call-
ing themselves

receiving full
support from

Party. What-
ever the rea-
sons for this

be, these students are doing the

Congress, and want real Student- ,

Faculty relationship.
No Specific Planks

That is their platform for which
they are asking students to vote.
They have not one speciﬁc plank.
We want to know what the con-
tinuation is going to be, how they
are going to cut down waste, how
they are going to improve re-
lationships. They propose no

plans to make a Student Con- A

gress active.

T h e Vet e r a n-Independent’

Party has presented a mature,
concrete platform. They state,
realistically, that they cannot
promise to push through all of
their ideas. But they‘ tell the
voters exactly what they are

going to try «to do. And I think

they will. ,

No Hedging *

They do not hedge in their
platforms by using superﬂuous,
worn phrases. They will seek
construction of a University
library, swimming pool, and
parking areas. They will give the
student body the long-sought
explanation as to how the Uni-
versity fee is expended.

The Panther "Party proposes‘

that something be done about
Student Congress. The Pitt-lnde-
pendent Party supplies the

port in ideals which should have

have suddenly decided to run
sans publicity. ,

Last Friday’s issue of the News
carried the list of. candidates
running on party slates, the per-
fect. opportunity for free cam-
paigning. The Pitt-VIP party
frankly announced their slate in-
cluded women and released their
names. The Panther Party re-
fused to permit publication of
their female candidates.

A party aﬂiliation should be a
dedicated position, a promise of
dedication to student interests.
To deny students a fair choice of
candidates is to deny the party
system its worth.

The purpose_ of

Permanent Parties
The Panther Party, proposes
advancement in the newly recog-

nized party set-ups. Again the .

Guyolmen are "more . speciﬁc.
They advocate permanent politi-
cal parties, making elected stu-
dent leaders responsible to the

i electroate.

The Panthermen, in not pro-
posing ‘any deﬁnite, plans for. a

-regime that they might control,

blast the present one. The Pitt-
Independent Party says: “Imple-
ment and preserve Jthe gains of
previous governments.” 1 . ~

Paul ‘Balles, prominent ﬁgure ‘

in the Panther Party organiza-
tion'and campaign, stated at last

ment day: .“This is the time we
can afford to make mistakes.“I
hope that there will be no
animosities as a result of the
campaign.” » I

No timeis the time for drastic
mistakes, M-r. Balles. Nor could
you call a long term plan, formed
by people who were cognizant, at
at the time of its birth, of its
rotten implications, effects, and
results, a mistake.

If students are afraid to carn-
paign openly for what they be-
lieve, they cannot expect the
support of the student body. In
an important organization such

as Student Congress, we need.

who will not be frightened by

Fear of banishment from other -

major activities may be a basis

for this withdrawal campaign.‘

Yet, women should realize that
this is not one of the qualities of
the Senior Queen, the “ideal”
senior woman.

The queen must show devo-

tion to the University. Practic-
ing deception in student affairs is
not showing devotion to the
school.‘ It reveals a lack of faith
in the student body, faculty, and
administration —— certainly n ot
qualities of a senior queen nor
an ideal woman.

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Some of collegiate wrestlings’ finest grapplers are _all
set to open the 1955 National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament this afternoon at Cornell’s Barton Hall with the
prime target Oklahoma A&M. _

Four champs are back from last year to defend their
titles. They are Dick Govig (123) of Iowa,-_Joe_ Solomon

(1.91) of Navy.

For both individual and team
titles, an East-Midwest battle.ap-
pears to be in the making among

the Big Ten’s top team, Michigan,

the Aggies of the Big Seven, and
Eastern titlist Pitt. Penn State’s
Nittany Lions, though, are not out
of the running by any stretch of
the imagination. '
Peery in Tough Class

Joe Solomon, 177-pound East-
ern champ and last years 167-
pound National champ, is the

, Blue and Gold’s best bet‘ to go all

the way. Main resistance‘ is ex-
pected to come from Joe Gattuso
of Navy--167-pound Eastern titl-
ist.

Ed ‘Peery, 130-pound Eastern
titlist, will be performing in the
123-pound class where there is
an abundance of top-notch mat-
ters headed by Jerry Billings of
the Aggies, Sid Nodland A of Penn
State, and defending champ Dick
Govig of Iowa.

Cook Ends Career

Another Jungle Cat who should
make his presence felt is Bill Hul-
ings, the East’s top 123.-pounder.
Little Bill will be weighing in at
115 in his first bid for a national

V title.

Captain Bob Cook closes his
collegiate career for the Panthers
as heseeks his first tourney title.
The Munhall senior was the vic-
tim of a referee’s decision in the
Easterns, and would like to
avenge that loss by winning at

Cornell.

Washington’s Ed DeWitt, un-
beaten in the regular season, is
‘given a good chance to cop the

hamper Ron Schrif (191) as he

soned veterans in defending
champ Pete Blair ofiNavy, Wer-
ner Seel of Lehigh, and Bill Ob-
erly of Penn State.

  Mitters Open Tough Schedule ‘
Next Weekl Against Buckeyes

In just one week the Panther baseball team will bite
‘into What Acting Coach Bob Lewis calls, “One of the tough-
est baseball schedules we’ve ever had at Pitt.”

The diamond men didn’t pick a softie to start things
on with either gince the first game is slated against Ohio
, State’s Buckeyes at Columbus, Apr. 1. ~

After this ‘starter, Lewis will send his charges against
the Buckeyes in a doublebill theé

next day and will then start one
southward jaunt which will show
the Panthers tangling with a pair
of first—rate. service teams——two
games with the Naval Air Station
at Norfolk and a single game with
the Quantico Marines.

Although they will have played
nine games in a two-week span,

, local fans will not get to see the

Panthers in action until Apr. .19
when they take on Westminster’s
Titans at the Mellon Field.

Lewis is a little wary to offer
any predictions on "the team’s
chances just yet but he does
admit that the pitching depart-
ment is causing him quite a ’bit
of worry at present. _

With Veteran Don Miller the A

only starting holdover from last
year’s mound corps, Lewis is
faced with having to pin much of
his hopes on the sophomore hur-
lers along with some relievers
from ‘the ’54 squad.

Lewis does express the opinion

Riflemen Hosts

To Mountaineers
By JOHN FAY

Seeming to have recovered well
from their loss at the regionals

last weekend in Buffalo, the Pan-

ther sharpshooters will entertain
a highly-touted Mountaineer team
from West Virginia tomorrow at
the Stadium riﬂe range.

Tom Shepard, team‘ captain, will

lead the shooters into this all-
important match. Hopes are high
for a victory which would enable
the Panthers to move into second

place in the Greater Pittsburgh

Riﬂe League. At the present «time
the Blue and Gold is in third
place with a 3-2 record behind
West Virginia and Duquesne who
are tied for the league lead at
4-1.

Completing the top’ ﬁve are
James Cleary, Dave Jacobson,
James Flynn, and Tom Klaric.
The other riflemen who will com-

pete in the meet are Bob Zwahlen, ‘

Dick Green, Dick Konis, Bob
Thompson, and George Evans.

Meeting Ohio State University’s
powerful team Apr. 2, at the
Stadium, the shooters hope to
close their dual team meets with
a victory. A- triangular meet with
West Virginia and Washington &
Jefferson at the Mountaineer’s
range will close the indoor season
for the Panthers Apr. 16.

Firing for the Blue and Gold
next Tuesday against 0 the Du-
quesne ROTC team will be John
Benacquista, Jack Brown, James
Flynn, Ronald Fry, Paul McCurdy,
Dick O’Reilly, Zwahlen, Al Hur-
banek, Al Lonergan, and John
Schneider. The Dukes team is
composed entirely of varsity
shooters so they should furnish
the ROTC with a very tough meet.

Early in May the varsity ﬁring
squad will compete in the Out-
door Intercollegiate Meet at Rose-
dale. Shepard and Cleary will be
among those men who will close
their college shooting with this
meet as they are graduating this
June. ‘

“We iMust Like
What We Have"

By DAVE MAZEB
Sports Editor

 

To a college student, gripes are the usual thing what with class-
mates, teachers, and everybody in general always having some com-
plaint. = '

Similarly, when a college sports editor hears the 'woes_ of a
coach, he usually just adds them to his daily collection and continues
on his merry way. But comes the dawn and once in a while these
complaints are worth a hearing. ‘ ‘

Such I think is the case with a few recent remarks concerning
athletic facilities here. Now with a million-dollar Field House a
reality, it might be understood that the place to practice and play has
been solved for the teams that need it.‘

Two sports, however, swimming and track, are still‘ struggling
for their rights. . '

The swimmers have practiced in various pools around the city
with the Pittsburgh Athletic Asso-
ciation pool providing the bulk of
the workouts during the past few.

The other squad, the trackmen, thought their problem was solved
with the erection of the Field House. In the past they"had to travel
out to Schoonmaker Hall in South Park for their daily workouts.

The athletic department tried to remedy this latter matter by
setting aside funds for the construction of removable bleachers. Evi-
dently not enough was appropriated because the high, schoolers
are still playing there and the thinclads aren’t.

so’, the swimmers and trackmen continue to battle for better
faciilties but amazingly enough, still keep their respective place in
collegiate athletics. The Eastern swimming championship and prod-
ucts like _Arnie Sowell attest to this.

must like what we have.” 

H elrnet-Bumping Gridders Step

By GENE AROMATORIO .

The baseball team has nothing on the footballers. While
the diamond men are having batting in the Field House, the
gridders are running through a batting session of their own
——only they are cracking helmets together at Trees Field.

The occasion for all this was the second day of spring
drills. After a cold day for a starter last Tuesday, the grid-
ders were really put through their paces Wednesday after-
noon and they seemed to relish it. Anyway, they ran through
a mess of fundamentals and a practice scrimmage with real
enthusiasm. 9

Five Panther mermen are in
the midst today of competing

mers in the nation at the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
swimming championships in Ox-
ford, Ohio.

The events got underway yes-
terday with the swimming of the
1500 meter freestyle and will end
tomorrow evening.

Chief Panther hopes are Jim
Zurcher in the 2.20 and 440-yard
freestyle and Skip Monsein in the
100 and 2010-yard backstroke
events. Both Monsein and_Zurcher
captured ﬁrst place in these
events at this year’s Easterns.

Another Blue and Gold Eastern
champ, Warne White, will partici-
pate in the 150-yard individual
medley, while team Captain Bill
Furrer already has competed in
the 1500 meter freestyle event.

The ﬁve Panther mermen will

then combine their efforts and I

participate in the freestyle’ and
medley relay events. Monsein,
Roy Kaupe, and White will com-
pete in the medley relay while
Zurcher, Furrer, Kaupe and
White will swim in the freestyle
relay.

Points are awarded to the ﬁrst
six men in each event, and the
ﬁrst ten to ﬁnish are considered

WHAT’S TH IS?
For solution see
paragraph below.

 

YOU'LL GET A BANG out of the Droodle above The title is: Daredevil enjoy-
ing better-tasting Lucky just before being shot from cannon. Luckies are
going great guns everywhere. The reason for their booming popularity is '
simply this: Luckies give you better taste. They taste better,‘ﬁrst of all,
because Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. Then, that tobacco‘ is toasted
to taste better. 5‘It’s Toasted_"—the famous Lucky Strike process—-tones up
Luckies’ light, mild, good-tasting tobacco to make it taste even better . . .
cleaner, fresher, smoother. Enjoy yourself when you smoke. Have a little
fun. Light up the better-tasting cigarette . . . Lucky Strike.
