A Pittsburgh rally and march ,to
protest violence against women will
be held Friday, Oct. 19 as part of

"‘Rape Awareness Week.” The

Pittsburgh march, sponsored by
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape
(PAAR), is one of several planned

violence against women; on the
street, in the home, at the
workplace and in the media,”
posters advertising the march
claim.

The march route will begin at the

‘PENN Central Railroad parking lot
at 7530 p.m. and proceed along

Liberty Avenue before a rally at
Point‘ State Park.

. Domestic violence, racism and
sexism, pornography and sexual
harassment will be subject of
speeches at the rally. The rally will
also feature a self-defense demon-
stration and ‘a “music by woman”
program. .

According to -PAAR’s October
newsletter, one out of three women
in the United States -willbe raped
and half of all married women are

' victims of “battering.”.‘

Crime statistics say a women is
raped every three seconds, one is
beaten every 18 seconds and that

_one out of every four women

experience sexual abuse before the
age of.l8.

Approximately 24 groups, in-
cluding Pitt’s Womens Center,
have announced support of the
march.

complaints arose, according to Ted
Kokladas,. cafeteria manger.

Some students said the types of

.food served in the cafeteria are

q good but often cold.

“The menu is basically good but

’ " if the food is served cold, it doesn't

make any difference,” said the
student. .

Kokladas said one reason for the
cold food is that cafeteria workers
often allow large numbers of

prepared plates to sit in the open,
rather than in the steam-heated
containers. ' '
“Sometimes, they also turn the
heating down (on the steam
heaters) so they can clean up
easier,” Kokladas said. A
“They try to make it easier on
themselves,”, . Kinderman added.
Another student complained
about rude cafeteria workers who
often are unfriendly and dis-
courteous to students. ‘

student. “They all seem to dislike
their jobs.”

“I don’t think these people are

Tom Albert, director of auxiliary
services, said students may com-
plain to cafeteria management
about rude workers. If the

complaints. are valid, a grievance

process may be instituted.
Students also complained about

an insufficient supply of dishes and

silverware during the dinner hour. _

\

One student employee of the
cafeteria said theproblem may be
due; in part, to students using
more dishes than needed.

Fred Anderson, a resident
student who eats‘ in the cafeteria,
said a small piece of metal become

lodged in between 0 his teeth,
cutting his gum after biting into a
piece of meat.

Anderson also found a piece of
meat that was covered with a green
substance. ' '

A spokesman for the cafeteria’s

meat supplier said the source of the '

metal is still unknown but the
green substance may have been
“vegetable ink” from the box the

meat‘ was packaged in.

Safety Measures  
Due for  

Crosswalk

A just-awaken student half walking, half run-
ning, hurries to his 8 a.m. class, for which he is al-
ready late. Meanwhile, a second student, also late"
for class, is anxious to find a parking place for his
car. The pedestrian glances at his watch and realizes

V just how late he is for his first class. He darts across
Bigelow Blvd. at the crosswalk between the Student
Union and the Cathedral. The motorist, having just

/

spotted a parking space across from the Syria

‘ Mosque, attempts to beat the light at Fifth before it

changes red. A fatal accident occurs, one which
could have been prevented.

Of course, this hasn’t happened yet. However,
given present conditions, the possibility of an
accident is not the least bit unlikely.

This area of Bigelow Blvd., one of the busiest I

crosswalks in Oakland, has been the scene of many
near-miss accidents between pedestrians and
motorists. In January 1978, the Student Government
Board sought the installation of a safety signal in the
vicinity. According to William Rodgers of
Pittsburgh’s Traffic Planning Office, “a solution to
the problem has never gone any further than
suggestions.” e

Because of the crosswalk’s closeness to the
intersection at Bigelow and Fifth, the use of a stop
sign or ﬂashing red light isn’t practical. The
installation of an underpass or an overpass, as

Page 6--Friday, October 12, 1979

suggested by the original Student Union renovation

plan, may be impractical as well because of the cost

and the length of time involved in its construction.
“Since the crosswalk is not at an intersection,

the motorist always has the right of way,” said '

Inspector Horace McDaniels of the Pittsburgh Police
Traffic Division. “The only reason that it (the
crosswalk) is there is so that people don’t get arrested
for jay-walking. ” .

The only real working solution may be a ﬂashing
yellow light on both sides of the crosswalk, to give
oncoming motorists the necessary warning of a
potential danger. A sign calling for the reduced

- speed of 15 miles per hour, the usual limit set for

school crossing areas, should be posted along with

' the light.

Some action should be taken soon, either by
university or city officials. These conditions have
existed for many years without correction, and it may
not be too long before a serious accident does occur.

Letters  

Fans and reporters covering the
1979-80 Pitt football team have
made it clear through articles in the
paper that they want a winning
football team, another national
championship team—PERlOD. No
unranlred team with a “Mediocre”
offense is wanted or will be put up
with. The offensive unit has been

- nick-picked since the beginning of

spring training in March. This has
been pursued to the extent of
comparing and contrasting the
coaching abilities and personalities
of Johnny Majors and Jackie
Sherrill.

The obvious reason behind this
public pressure is to encourage
Sherrill to start superstar. fresh-
man Dan Marino instead of proven
successful, junior Rick Trocano.
Well, in my opinion Panther fans
Your
frequently used freedom of speech
has been backﬁring. Instead of
encouraging Sherrill into switching

, his tactics, it is putting undue

pressure on Rick, Dan. and the
entire offensive unit.
In Rick's case there is no doubt

that preparing mentally for a game
is getting tougher and tougher.
Any lack of confidence he has in
himself or the offensive unit has in
him is no fault of his own but of
yours. It is tough to be a leader
when people doubt your ability,
even after proving it time and time
again (.15 games to be exact).

Dan is in the same boat,
however, at the other end. He is

getting all the glamour and cheers, ’

which‘ he well deserves, but is it
totally fair to him? Can he be
expected to run and perfect an
offense in a Terry Bradshaw
fashion his freshman year. This
public pressure can cause a great
mental strain and either make or
break an athlete. In this case let’s
hope for the former.

Forget the critical analysis and
let Coach Sherrill run the team not
the public with its pressure. Let
us, the fans and supporters of the
Panthers, be behind them during
both the good and the bad times (in
this case the Trocano and Marine
times) and apply the pressure not

request. ‘

Problems Need
Pope Trip Funds

With all of the hoopla centered
around the Pope visiting Catholic
centers of the world, Ireland, South
America, Mexico, Boston, Phila-
delphia. New York et. al., I was
wondering if for one minute, the
crying millions that surround him
to hear his humble words knew all
along what he was going to say.
And if they had heard it all before
(i.e. man must interact in peace
and harmony. Peace be with all
man kind. blah, blah, blah etc.)
Think of how much money would

be saved by the Vatican and by all‘

of the cities and countries had they
not spent the money on the Pope
and his entourage (who is a very
wealthy man in reality but
committed to poverty by his
ideals), and channeled the money
towards more logical programs:
creating jobs. alleviating poverty
and producing better housing.
Maybe then what the Pope
preaches could actually occur.
instead of a big festival with
rhetoric going .in one ear and out
the other.

Of course this is unrealistic and
idealistic on my part because there
will always be poverty. unemploy-
ment and inadequate housing. and

people will always hear what«they--

want to hear, but maybe, just
maybe, if the money could be
appropriated more thoughtfully
without the fanfare . and bureau-
cracy, everything could be reduced
to a more manageable level.

ROTC Article

Deficient
I am writing in reference to an
article about
published in the Pitt News October
8, 1979. There are several aspects
of the article written by Cynthia
Cohen which should be addressed.
Initially, I feel that most of the
quotations were taken out of
context. Otherwise, why would the
Professor of Military Sciences
' make such statements as “we don’t
go’ out of our way to degrade
people” and “I don’_t feel that we
are to blame for the military
carrying out the decisions of the
president..."
Secondly, the term “ROTC” is
not all-encompassing. Here at Pitt
there is an Army and Air Force
program—each is a separate
entity. The Department of Aero-
space Studies (the Air Force ROTC
program) is “alive and well" at
Pitt! We operate under a consor-
tium arrangement with other
schools in the Greater Pittsburgh
area. In the Air Force program, we
have 160 students enrolledand 95
are Pitt students,

I issue, the fact

ROTC which was

With regard to the accreditation
is that several
schools accept more than a “small

\number” of credits. The School of

Education grants 14 credits,
Nursing School and School of
General Studies 12 credits and the

‘Engineering School 5 credits for

AFROTC.

I am absolutelypositive that you
would not be able to ﬁnd an
AFROTC cadet who regards
anything about his or her enroll-
ment as “degrading” or that, upon
his/her commissioning in the Air
Force, he/ she sould feel as though

he/she would have to share the

“blame” for carrying out the
President’s orders. After all, we
are talking about the defense of our
United States, aren’t we?

With reference to female partici-
pation, 45 of our AFROTC students
are female. 22 of those are enrolled

_at Pitt, and 13 have been awarded

scholarships by the U.S. Air Force_.
The ﬁgures quoted in Ms. Cohen's
article are hardly representative of
the AFROTC program at Pitt.

In point of fact, much of Ms.
Cohen's article misrepresented the
facts. I am sure that it was
unintentional. but that is beside the
point. The point is that the
AFROTC program is “thriving" at
Pitt, -and we feel that we have a
viable program which is attractive
to many‘young,men and women in
the Pittsburgh area.

Grand Prix   at Watkins Glen:   Party, Racing and Party   -0 ,.

By BRUCE GERSON

The 21st annual Toyota Grand _

Prix of the United States was held
last weekend in Watkins Glen,
N.Y., before a crowd of approxi-
mately 200,000 people. Canada’s
Gilles Villeneuve, racing for the
Ferrari team, received the check-
iered ﬂag ﬁrst, and France’s Rene

Arnoux of the Renault-Elf team
ﬁnished second in a ﬁeld of 35
drivers. '

The cross-country-type, 3.1 mile
track put the drivers and their
Formula I race cars through 59 laps
of difficult turns and curves: The
Formula I cars, which are geared
for Grand Prix racing, reach about
200 miles per hour down the

straightaway before the drivers
must downshift and reduce speed
in order to negotiate the intricate
S-curves and sharp turns.

Such top names .as Mario
Andretti, Carlos Reutemann, Nicki

~' Lauda, Jody Schecter and Emerson

Fittipaldi were among the ﬁeld of
35 starters at Watkins Glen.
The Woodstock-type crowd was

treated to a full weekend of racing
before the big race took place on
Sunday. Camping out on the track
inﬁeld, the racing enthusiasts let
loose and went crazy. Good music,
alcohol, and drugs were rampant.

On Friday and Saturday, time
trials were held to determine the
positions of the drivers at the start.
Other races also took place during

these two preliminary days. The

$30,000 Celebrity Race included ._

Paul Newman, Dean Paul Martin,
Gene Hackman, Jan-Michael Vin-
cent and Kent McCord. The
Historic Race also took place,

featuring more than 30 race cars '

from the 1960s and early 1970s.
At night, the crowd was

  Booters Upset Davis and kins  

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Led by two Jeff Tissue goals, the
Pitt soccer team defeated Davis
and Elkins College by a 2-0 score
Wednesday night. The win was
only the second of the season for
the Panthers, who boosted their
record to 2-5-2.

“I just _don’t understand this
season,” said Panther midﬁelder
Bob Hughes. f‘We ‘play great
"against good teams as our record
shows but then when we play other
teams we just don't get up for
them.”

“It’s only natural that you get
more psyched up to play those
teams that are known to be tough
and are more publicized,” agreed
Tissue." “What we have to do now
is play each game as we did against
Davis and Elkins. If we can
accomplish that, we can be very-
successful for the rest of 'our
season.”

The Panthers took’ command in
the‘ contest early ‘when Tissue
scored his ﬁrst goal of the night
with -only eight minutes gone in the
ﬁrst half. Fullback Torn Kunkel,
who is ‘having an excellent season
on defense’, carried the ball ‘upﬁeld
and found Tissue open. Kunkel
completed a long pass to Tissue,

who made a head shot for the
score. I V

From that point, the game was
solely in the hands of the Panthers,
although Pitt ended the night with
just 16 shots-on-goal.

The Panthers took a halftime
lead into the locker room for the
ﬁrst time this fall. Momentum

stayed with Pitt when they took the ~

ﬁeld_for the second half, and, for
the ﬁnal 45 minutes, the Panthers
controlled their opposition.

“The entire team played a much’
better game against Davis and
Elkins,” said Coach Leo Bemis.
“Jeff (Tissue) looked _ good
throughout the game as did many
others. “We played more as a
team,” Bemis added. . “We were
more relaxed, and our passing was
much more accurate. The game

«showed me that the team is starting

to ﬁnally play up to the potential
that we have had all season long.”

The second Pitt goal came with
ﬁve minutesremaining in the game
when Panther wing Eric Tiedtke
was fouled by a Davis and Elkin’s
player within the penalty area.
When a foul takes place within that
area, the 'team being fouled has, a
chance for a penalty kick. Tissue
was elected to take the shot, which

was good enough to secure the.

Panther victory.

Goalkeeper Mark Robertson
recorded his second shutout of the
season as he has been in goal for
both Panther victories.

Panthers substituted _freely
throughout the evening, as is
common practice.

“I think that a‘ lot of credit should
be given to Al Adelmann and Eric
Tiedtke coming off the bench,”
said Werner Woodman, one of the
Panther midﬁelders. “They both
went into the game and played 100
percent all the time» they were in
there.” ’

The Panthers next face' the’
Edinboro Scots in their ﬁnal home
game of the 1979 season Wednes-
day. Pitt defeated’Edinboro last
year, 3-1. Edinboro should prove,

to be one of those lesser teams the .

Panthers seem to be havingtrouble
with so far this year. But, with a
week to work before the contest,,
the Panthers should be ready.

' “We’re ﬁnally starting to look
like , a team out there,” said
Hughes, “and we’re going to keep
it that way. I think we have all had
more than our share of losing this
season. From now on, it’s going to
be nothing but wins.”

Pm-Cincy BaﬂIeGood Tune-upfor Washington

Tomorrow morning’s football game between Pitt
and Cincinnati should be a good tune-up for the

  InstantReplay

team in that San Clancy, Sammie Ellis and Carlton
Neverson are back. Throw in Ed Scheuermann, -the

Panthers’ battle With Presently Undefeated and SiXth- by Sam Scjuﬂo '6«foot-ll center who missed last season with a foot

The UC Beareats are Pr0bablY a m0re exciting ° ~ last/season’s 18-11 record and second-place finish in

team to watch than Boston College, and they plan on
bringing several busloads of fans to the game. Pitt,
along with North Carolina and Florida State, are the
Top-20 teams on UC’s schedule, and the boys from
the Queen City would love nothing better than to
knock off a big-time power such as Pitt.

With a big win tomorrow, the Panthers will put
themselves in an excellent position going into the
Washington game. Despite talk to the contrary, Pitt
is still very much in the running for a major bowl bid
and a spot in the Top 10. Syracuse is the -only team
ranked ahead of Pitt in the East, and Navy is
undefeated. Pitt plays both of those teams later this
season at Pitt Stadium, which gives the Panthersa

. decided advantage.
5 Pitt’s other Eastern opponents, Army and West,

Virginia, will be played on the road, but the
Panthers’ pure talent should enable them ‘to. escape
each team’s stadium unscathed, particularly
Mountaineer Field.

The season finale at Penn State should again be a
truly great game, and thebowl bids will be out before

' it is played. The Lions are no longer in contention ,

for a major bowl bid but, with the exception of
Washington, are the best team Pittrwill play during
the regular season (yes, they are better than North
Carolina). .

One way or the other, next week’s game with
Washington will be televised on Channel 4. The
game will either be telecast locally or picked up by

Pitt Athletic Director Cas Myslinski will have 10
find someone else to push around the Fieldél-louse
this winter. ’

That’s right, “Tiger” Paul Auslander, Pitt’s.

unofficial, yet most effective cheerleader, has '

decided to pack his bags and head for the sweltering

heat and fancy nightlife in Las Vegas, where he’ll
‘ work in a casino. T

For you freshmen who are unaware of Tiger’s
existence, simply ask an uppercla sman who he is and
what he does. If not, tune in the orld Series games
this weekend from Three Rivers Stadium. Don’t be
surprised to see “Tiger” dancing up a storm on the

While on the subject of Pitt basketball, coach Tim

Grgurich’s team begins practice this Monday. The
basketball Panthers should be similar to last year's

« . . : . . . .

the Eastern Eight Tournament. -

But asserious Pitt fans, know, a season wouldn’t

be complete "without one or two catastrophes prior to
the first jump ball. And they could happen.

This past summer, Clancy collapsed after a

summer league game, and had to be hospitalized for
several days. Doctors still don’t know the cause of
the incident, and Grgurich will probably go easy on
his star player throughout practice. I

Scheuermann, who has increased his weight to ,

about 217 pounds, has been hampered , by a blood
disorder, but he should be ready to play, although his
stamina will be tested severely. .

~ And, last but not least, comes the news that Ellis
may have to go into the hospital because of an injury
to his left side. '

But all news is not bad news for the Panthers.

Three players who figure prominently in Grgurich’s
plans—Dwayne Wallace, Dave Olinger and junior
college transfer Lenny McMillan—are said to be
playing. well, and should help cushion the loss of
Terry Knight, Wayne Williams and Pete Strickland.

Another key addition could be John Ryan, a 6-

foot-1‘ guard from Wilkinsburg. \ -

And for those who may have missed it, Valley's

Bill Varner is at Notre Dame, and Schenley’s Larry
Anderson’s at Nevada, Las Vegas. ‘

  Fast Freddie Jacobs:  
  ‘”Bn"ng on ‘Home Boys’

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

This week’s game against
Cincinnati is a special contest for
one of the Panther players. It's a
sort of homecoming away from
home for Fred Jacobs, who hails
from the city by the river." As he
anxiously awaits the game, the
senior halfback realizes that the
offense has not performed up to
expectations, but also waits for the
day when the unit puts it all

'7.6gether.

“I’m playing as hard as I can,
but things just haven't worked out
that well. I expect things to
‘change, but as far as the press
getting on me that's okay because
that's their job. It doesn’t bother
me but I am aware of it,” he said.

Although he is all too well aware
of the fact that the offense has not
played up to its potential, Jacobs
seems disappointed in the Panther
fans. A ,

“We’re playing our h/earts out,
but the fans are booing constant-

“I just feel sorryvfor the team
that we play when we put it all
together. We have been playing
good ball but every time something
seems to stop us,” the senior
halfback said.

“After all, how can you expect to
score when you’re being penalized»
or when the halfback is. always"
fumbling,” he added with a wry —
smile. It is this carefree attitude
that has helped Jacobs overcome
some early-season criticism by the

ly,” he said. “They’re quick-to
jump on the bandwagon when we
win, but I just wish they’d stick
with us through the rough times.”

Jacobs is a speech and commun-
ications major who someday hopes
to become a disc jockey, but right
now he is concentrating on football.
He would like to try a professional
football career because, as he puts
it, “I really owe it to myself to try;
after all, football is in my blood.”

The.Cincinnati game is going to
be a treat for Jacobs, who is eager
to perform a/gainst players he faced
and played with inhigh school.

“Playing against my home boys
isgoing to be great,” he said.

“I also would like to show those
other teams around the nation that
we’re not dead,” Jacobs added.
“Wejust need to get off to .a good
start and then we’ll romp. -- We'll be
ready for Washington.”

Jean Balthaser and Jim
Boila, coaches of the women's,

basketball team, will conduct
tryouts for anyone interested.

1     1NOWConvention Held in Los Angeles

LOS ANGELES—Feminist author Betty Friedan told the
National Organization for Women on Sunday that political
candidates will have to provide guarantees of commitment
to the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to get support
from women voters. _

 ~ “I will not support Teddy Kennedy no matter what, until

' I have guarantees about women’s rights...about the Equal

Rights Amendment,” said Ms. Frieclan, one of NOW’s
founders.

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has not announced
his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination,
although he’s considered a strong contender.

“We will not forgive. We will not forget,” she said of
past NOW-endorsed political candidates who failed to keep
their promises to support ERA ratiﬁcation after they were
elected.

Ms. Friedan’s remarkscame in the ﬁnal day of NOW’s
three-day 12th annual national convention here. _

’ . “We were had by Carter,” she told reporters later.
“We will have to get guarantees. We got words of‘ promise
from Carter, but we didn't ‘get the muscle. We re not
going to support anyone who doesn’t deliver the goods.

Ms. ’Friedan said that if President Carter ‘were to use his
inﬂuences to get the ERA ratiﬁed in Florida and 'Illionois,

the remaining unratiﬁed states would be vying for the right
to be the ﬁnal state that makes the amendment a part of the
U.S. Constitution. ‘ ,

The ERA, which would outlaw discrimination based on
sex, must be ratiﬁed by 38 'states by J une 30, 1982.

So far, 35 states have ratiﬁed it, although ﬁve states have
voted to rescind their ratiﬁcations.

ever, was predictable—a ‘certain
ritual at Watkins Glen. Every year,
numbers of cars are taken to a
section of the inﬁeld known as the

“Bog.” There, these cars are set _

on ﬁre, and people watch these
bonﬁres all night long. This year
about 20 cars, including a 1979
Corvette, were torched. -

Why? Because it’s tradition at
“The Glen.”

The soar of the Formula I cars on
Sunday was an alarm clock of sorts

to the partied-out crowd. Everyone
gotupand started all over again.

Other Grand Prix races are held
in ‘Italy, Canada, Monte Carlo,
Spain, South Africa, and at Long
Beach, California. None of them,
however, gets quite as wild as the
Watkins Glen. ’

On Sunday night, spectators took
to the road themselves, some of
them traveling as far as Michigan,
