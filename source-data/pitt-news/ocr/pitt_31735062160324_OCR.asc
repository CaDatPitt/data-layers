Police Refuse

BY N.J. BROWN

The Campus Police are still
working without a contract despite
the negotiated settlement with the
University reached August 31.

The settlement was typed into
contract form by the University and
submitted to the Police (Local
Union No. 249) for their signatures.

The Union’s negotiating re-
presentatives discussed the sub-
mitted contract and voted not to
accept it.

“We didn’t sign soley because it
wasn’t what we agreed upon,” said
Officer Robert Kolesky, who
participated in the negotiations.

According to Kolesky, there
were numerous differences be-
tween the contract the Union
agreed to and the one which the
University submitted.

One of the major alterations,
Kolesky insisted, was the way in
which vacation pay is determined
for part-time employees. Ac-
cording to the typed form of the
contract: “Part-time employees
shall be granted a prorata share of

vacation entitlement based on the a

number of hours worked in the
prior calendar year.”

According to photostats of notes
which Kolesky identified as those
made by Superintendent Joseph
Gil during contract negotiations, it
was agreed that this section would
read: “Part-time employees shall
be granted a -prorata share of

Activities Fair To

Publicize Campus

Clubs & Programs

BY MARGARET PICKING

Pitt will hold its annual Activities
Fair, September 19-21. The fair,

sponsored by Student Govern-
ment’s Committee on Student
Organizations (CSO), will take

place on the Student Union lawn.

The fair will offer University
students the opportunity to famil-
iarize themselves with the various
clubs and organizations on campus.

Representatives of the organi-
zations will be available to answer
questions. Students can also sign
up for the activities which interest
them.

Response to the fair from student-
organizations has been favorable.
Approximately 50 organizations
will be represented, among them
the Interfraternity Council and the
Panhellenic Association. Accord-
ing to Rich Tarquinio, co-chairman

of CS0, the fair will offer
something for everyone.
Students will also have an

opportunity to meet members of
the Student Government Board,
who will discuss any problems
which students have encountered.
Tarquinio added, “Student Gov-
ernment has been very helpful.
They have a well-selected Board

Contract

Campus Police hit snag in contract negotiations.

vacation entitlement based on the
equivalent number of whole years
worked.”

The original agreement, Kolesky
said, based vacation time on
accumulation of seniority. The
altered form ignores seniority, he
added.

Kolesky explained that if full-
time officer switched to part-time
and worked only 20 hours per
week, his vacation pay would be
based on his 20 hours, regardless
of how many years he had been
with the force previously. Had the
original provision remained in the
contract, Kolesky said, such an
officer would add one-half year to
his seniority total.

Seniroity in the Campus Police
Department, Kolesky added, is a
process of accumulation, including
both full and part-time jobs.
Kolesky felt this was a fair system
and should be utilized in awarding
vacation time, especially since it
had been agreed to by both sides in
the negotiations.

Other problems the Union
negotiating board members saw in
the submitted contract included:
“The University reserves the right
to review and determine the
number of employees necessary for
the prosecution of any University
case or matter.”

Kolesky commented that if he
were the one involved with the case
and the one who had first hand
knowledge of the case, it is he who

Photo by Wilson

P should determine which ofﬁcers he

needs to help prosecute his case.

The University, he says, is not as
qualified to make this kind of a
judgement.

Another problem with the
contract as submitted, Kolesky
said, is that it leaves the University
an open door with respect to
contracting out security work. This
was threatened in an August letter
from the University to Richard
Peluso, representative for the
Police Union.

The contract article in question
states: “The University will not
contract out work normally per-
formed by members of the
bargaining unit unless the em-
ployees who are employed on the
date of this Agreement are working
normal workweeks (40 hours).

According to Kolesky, there are
17 overtime jobs available per
week, because the force is not up to
full capacity of 72. He derived this
figure from the number of mobs
which were re-bid on during this
past summer.

“According to this contract they
want us to sign,” Kolesky said,
“the University could contract
those 17jobs out to an independent
security outfit."

Kolesky also was informed by
Union representative Peluso that
the Blue Cross-Blue Sheild plan
listed in the contract is not the one
which was agreed upon and differs

University to Charge $5
For Add—Drop Service

BY CATHY TUTTLE

A $5 add/ drop fee and a 25 cents
charge for the time schedule will go
into effect winter term.

The time schedule will be sold at
the bookstore. “It costs us $15-20

1 thousand dollars to print them, but
' kids take them and then don’t use

them. Janitors find time schedules
all over the campus--in waste-
baskets by the dozen...every-
where,” says Frank Reed, Regis-
trar.

Students this winter will be
permitted one free add/ drop.
“We’re not doing this to make
money. It costs us several times
the $5 to process the add/ drop.
We’re doing this to stop the
students who abuse the system.”

Reed added “They sign up for
courses they don’t plan to take.
Students may add/ drop three, four
or ﬁve times. lt’s totally ludicrous.
We’re doing this just to keep the

,1

seats in the closed sections open.”

Reed says the number of
students who add/ drop has grown
at an alarming rate. “The curve of
growth of students who add/ drop
has been phenomenal. lt’s gone
straight up-—from a couple thou-
sand students a few years ago to
15,000 this year.”

About the cost of the schedules
Reed says, “We’ve run up a utility
bill alone of $800,000 extra. We
need to save money...Penn State

and Temple charge for their
schedules. We’ve just joined the
crowd.”

If a student must add/drop
because of poor advising Reed
s'ays, “That’s going to be rather
tricky. If the student can prove his
advisor was wrong, he can have his
$5 refunded. We have to go
through this procedure to make
sure all students don’t try to get
their add/ drop fee withheld.”

No End In Sight For

Parkway Construction

BY MITCH BERRY

The rash of recent road construc-
tion which has plagued Pitt
commuters during the summer
months is destined to continue for
some time. “

The most extensive work being
done is on the Parkway West,
affecting all eastbound traffic in the
one-mile zone between the new

Interstate 79 and the Rosslyn
Farms interchanges. As of
Monday, September 10, those

interchanges were restricted to one
lane. ’

According to a Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation
(PennDot) spokesman, work on the
Parkway is deemed necessary in
order to complete construction of
the interchanges by adding to and
tying in new lanes to the present
roadways.

The Rosslyn Farms interchange
will be finished in about two weeks,
while work on the Montour
interchange will be prolonged until

WQED to Promote Programming A

BY MICHAEL CLINTON

WQED-FM will bring its road-
show to Pitt's Student Union lawn
Tuesday.

According to Jack Sommers,
station manager of WQED, the
roadshow is being held at area
colleges to help inform people that
the station exists.

In an effort to develop a fine arts
station in the Pittsburgh area,
WQED began broadcasting seven
months ago.

The programming developed
included classical concerts, poetry
readings, lectures, and also the
entire season of the Pittsburgh

Symphony Orchestra.

Since its inception, the radio
station has received excellent
reception from the community,
according to Sommers, and is now
ranked as the 19th leading public
radio station in the nation.

Special programming for Pitt will
begin on Monday on the FM
station. Although normal pro-
gramming will be broadcasted,
special musical programs from
various Pitt musical organizations
will be included. ‘

Some of the special program-

ming will be performed by the
University Marching Band,

the ’

Women's Choral Group, Pitt Glee
Club, and from various individuals
in the music department.

Sommers explained “The best
way to reach the students and to
expose them to fine arts radin is to
visit the campuses in the vicinity.”

He added that he hoped the
student community will be as
receptive to the station as the rest
of the community has been.

For all students who are
interested in listening to the three
days of special broadcasting,
WQED is at 89.3 on the FM dial.

at. least the end of October, the
PennDot spokesman added.

In another area of the City,
dedication for the Liberty Tubes
rehabilitation will be held Friday.

Beginning November 1, the
Liberty Tubes will be closed one at
a time, and commuters should be
prepared for some traffice
congestion in the area of the Tubes.

PennDot has also announced that
starting next spring they will
launch an all-out renovation of the
entire Parkway system which,
according to PennDot “will affect
traffice in a big way.”

City roads are also receiving their
share of construction with Baum
Boulevard being the major area.
According to Lee Goldman of the
City Road Maintenance depart-
ment, work is now under way for
the demolition of the old Baum
Boulevard Bridge and the erection
of a new one. The completion date
on this project is unknown.

Work is also being done on both
Negely and Millvale Avenues in
The City, although traffic is being
maintained, and Pitt commuters
should not be affected, according to
Goldman.

More extensive work is being
planned for these City roads, but
Goldman said, “We may or may
not follow through with these
plans.”

Of particular interest to com-
muters is the road construction
work being done on Center and
Craig Streets and Bigelow Boule-
vard in Oakland. While much is
being done in these areas, neither
the State nor the City claims
jurisdiction over the streets, and as
such, neither the spokesman for
PennDot nor Goldman of City
Maintenance were acquainted with
details of construction.

News Analysis

Dorm Curfew Policy Contrary to Student Interest

Since the ordering of the 1 a.m.
dorm curfew was handed down
from high places in the University,
administrative and student react-
ions have shed at least some light

on the problems.

Yet contradictions in the practi-
cal argument between the two
factions leave the student body
waiting impatiently for solutions.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar has
said of the situation: “The physical
safety of the students is more
important than petitions or student
opposition. Dr. Moye and I are

responsible for injury to our
students and are aware of the
seriousness of the problem.”

There is a problem. The rape
which occured in the Towers this
past July illustrates this very
clearly. However, there seems to
be serious contradictions in this
new University policy.

Dr. Posvar is correct in his plea for
tightened security, but this does
not explain the current plight of the
Campus Police. They have recently
had contract disputes involving an
inter-departmental trial board
which would, in the end, improve
campus security. The request for
that trial board was rejected by the
University.

“The situation presented an

urgency for common safety that
outweighed consideration of

student input. We had to get the
security system planned during the
summer so it could be implemented
in the fall,"Posvar said at the
recent SAAC meeting.

However, students brought the
need for increased security to the
attention of the Administration as
early as last October during the
security crisis. Has it taken the
University almost a year to decide
that security is an urgent problem?

There are points of contention
in this security crisis.
Rege Kaufman and others have
proposed viable alternatives to the
University’s dorm curfew policy.
The University administration
should consider these alternatives
or come up with a better rationale
for their own policy.

New Dorm Curfew

Lac/<5 Po/ice

According to a poll, Campus
Police are not very enthusiastic
about the new curfew which
prohibits access to the dormitories
by non-residents after 1 A.M.

Most officers feel the curfew will
not cut down theft or vandalism in
the dorms because of loopholes in
the curfew plan. For example, a
person may enter the dorms at
12:55 A.M. and remain there after
1 A.M.

Many officers also predicted the
new dormitory regualtion will lack
vigorous enforcement and will
simply act in restraining student
mobility.

However, Superintendent of

Campus Police Joseph Gill denied A

the curfew would inhibit student
freedoms. , T

Gil praised the intentions of the
curfew saying it was meant to
enable students to “live in safety

Support

and pursue their studies.”

Many police mentioned a higher
crime level in the Towers than in
the Quad. They suggested that a
sign-in system, similar to the
Quad’s be instituted in the Towers.

Gil however attributed the
difference in crime rates to the
difference in student make up in
the Towers and the Quad. He felt a
sign-in system in the Towers would
not increase security there.

There was unanimity among
police interviewed that student
cooperation would be most effec-
tive in mitigating the security
problem in the dorms.

Campus Policeman Rege Clif-
ford, who patrols the dorm area,
suggested that more cooperation is
needed between resident students,
Campus Police, and the Judicial
Board. ‘

this year and they’re really looking
out for the student’s interest.”
An Activities Fair has been held at
Pitt for the past four years, but,
according to Tarquinio, has not
been successful. He attributes this
to a bad location. Tarquinio
continued, “This year it’s in a good
position. Hopefully, the student
body will be able to attend without
going too much out of their way.”
Beginning last April, CSO under-
took an extensive study of student
organizations, for the purpose of
“weeding out” dead organizations

which exploit University funds. At
the Activities Fair, CSO will take an
inventory of the organizations and
the materials these organizations
have purchased through Student
Activities funds. The results of
their study will be posted in the
Student Government offices, 305
Schenley Hall. ,

Tarquinio feels improved location,
good participation, and an active,
concerned Student Government
promise to make this year’s
Activities Fair a success.

The hours of the fair are
Wednesday, 12-6; Thursday, 12-8;

He would like to place more men,

Column and a Half

BY JOHN METCALFE
'It has been a good while since I said anything
about President Nixon here, and even longer since I
said anything favorable to the man, here or

v anywhere. I will attempt to clear up at least one of

these problems.

It is already well known that a bill to raise the
minimum wage from $1.60 per hour to $2.00 per hour
was passed by both houses of Congress and sent to
Richard Milhous Nixon, who vetoed it. He said it
would be inﬂationary, and would create unemploy-

’ ment among those who are obliged to work for the

lowest pay permitted by law. Some of Mr. Nixon’s
critics have claimed that he acted out of concern for
the interests of employers and a lifelong indifference
to the economically unfortunate. All of this may be
true. I am prepared to offer good odds that Nixon is
both business-oriented and hard-hearted. But it is
not enough.

Lately I have been trying to find some justification
for purchasing one of those clever pocket calculators,
about the size of a fancy cigarette lighter and
incredibly clever about solving the most complicated
calculations_ and displaying the answers in lighted
numerals. This might seem a foolish purchase for an
English major whose budget is limited by the
generosity of the Veterans Administration, but I want
one of these gadgets anyway. I am working out_
excuses for the purchase even as I write here.

I will surely get one, as the price drifts downward.

and my determination grows. I am already in the
habit of finding or inventing mathematical
relationships in everyday events, and passing them
off as important. Once this habit is firmly enough
established. it will be a simple matter to explain the
purchse of a calculator on the grounds it will relieve
the awful burden of doing arithmetic with pencil and
paper.

This is getting complicated and tedious, but I want
to make it perfectly clear that there is a purpose to
this essay beyond the usual desire to give the
Presidential nose yet another tweak.

If Mr. Nixon had failed to veto the minimum-wage
legislation, the consequences would have been
shocking. At the new rate, it would have taken only
ﬁfty people working at the lowest level to equal the
salary of the President, rather than the sixty-six and
two-thirds laborers currently required. I suspect that
the two-thirds of a worker is someone with too many
dependants,vthough he might just happen to be sick
four months out of every year. Most people who earn
a minimum wage do not get paid sick leave.

To study the arithmetic from another angle, the

new law would have allowed a humble worker to earn
in a single year as much as Nixon gets for week,
rather than the more sensible ﬁfteen months it now
takes.

The intent of Congress in passing this insidious
legislation is clear. If Nixon had inadvertantly
neglected to veto it, it would have meant that a
worker at the lowest level of our society would be a
full 2% as prosperous and important as the President
himself. That worker is already l.6667°7o as good as
Nixon, and damned lucky to be that high.

(In the interest of fairness, I am considering only
the $200,000.00 Mr. Nixon receives as salary, and not
the $50,000.00 he is given as non-taxable expense
money, even though very few earners of the
minimum wage have expense accounts. We are
concerned with salaries here, and besides, the
arithmetic is a lot harder with a figure like
$250,000.00.)

Mr. Nixon is also concerned that the higher
minimum wage would cause unemployment among
those who can least afford it. His concern is noble
and commendable, but I do not understand his basic
assumption. He says that jobs would vanish, but not
how this would happen. Does he mean that the tasks
now done for $1.60 per hour would no longer get
done, and we would have to get along without
whatever comforts we now extort from the poor? Or
does he assume that none of the work done for $1.60
is important anyway, and that one two-dollar worker
can easily replace two or even three of the cheaper
variety?

Would work for the very young vanish, because
adult workers could be gotten for the same price?
Would McDonald's go out of business? Or would
they be forced to raise their prices (and profits)?

Unemployment among the school-aged would be
tragic, by the way. Just last week one of Mr. Nixon’s
henchmen ‘was allowed to speak on television about
the growing crisis in school lunches--the money
allocated no longer suffices to buy a nourishing
lunch--and he said that the thought of increased
Federal subsidies “is not very high on our
priorities.” Clearly the new law would have led to an

Why Should Students Pay More?

. BY CATHY TUTTLE

This winter we're going to have
to pay $5 for Add/ Drop as well as a

wasting money on utility bills (up
$800,000 from last year), in heating
and air conditioning buildings that

do challange the $5 fee, will make
extra administrative costs in
paperwork. Imagine too, 30,000

quarter fee for a Time Schedule.
We’ve already had a $15 hike in
tuition.

It won’t be long before the
“free” campus bus will cost 25
cents, a swim in Trees pool, a dime
and the use of the john will cost
who knows what.

Can’t the University better
create funds by cutting back on
athletic spending; on events that
only a tiny fraction of the students
are involved in? Can’t they stop

are practically empty? Can’t they
eliminate some of the questionable
positions of Assistant to the
Assistant to the Assistant Deans
and instead turn to positions and
programs that clearly benifit the
entire student body?

Appartently not.

Students, inaccurately advised
by their counselors, or students
whose courses have been cancelled
cannot or will not bother to get back
their $5 Add/ Drop fee. Those who

students in the bookstore, lined up
to buy their time schedules.

In making policies that are
unfair, wasteful, and time con-
suming, the University has
defeated its goals of saving money
and helping the students. In fact,
they have done just the opposite;
they have wasted money and made
Add/Drop difficult for the stu-
dents.

Sure, the University needs
money, but there must be better
ways of getting it.

Letters to the Editor

Abortion

To: The Pitt News
Dear Mr. Johnson:

To pull the fulcrum line for this
reply, I quote Mr. Johnson's
interesting line: “The Medical
Action Committee of Student
Government has already agreed to
make all the necessary arrange-
ments for this debate. All that is
now needed in an affirmative
response from Mr. Buzonas." My
answer. of course, is yes: with
certain demands made upon you
and the Medical Action Committee
of Student Gov.

Curiously, you use the sentence:
“It is time to put-up or shut-up.”
Are you quite sure that you are
capable of doing either? I say this

I because Women Concerned for the

Unborn Child and Pennsylvanians
for Human Life have been after
your kind a long time for a public
debate. It always seems that
towards the end of A.lA's pathetic
forensic efforts Women Concerned
had trouble to get you select

‘individuals to come out for a

rigorous showdown. From what
I’ve heard and observed, pro-
abortionists are not too eager to
really come out into the open where
certain equalizers are at play. And
here is where the demands will be
made on you and anybody else who
will wish to be on a debate panel.

You say in your letter: “...let it
be mentioned that there is
absolutely no evidence to support
Mr. Buzonas’ claims of increased
sterility, prematurity, etc." You
are a paradoxical baloney pedaller,
absolutely. Upon reflection,_you
are enough to put any pro-lifer into
laughing hysterics. You make
another assumption about my
making a statement on Rh factors:
“His lack of knowledge is clearly
shown when he mentioned the
possibility of Rh-sensitization may
bearproblem." You make all these
grad assumptions that I pull these
points out of the air, like a rabbit
out of a hat.

In ABORTION AND SOCIAL
JUSTICE, edited by Thomas W.
Hilgers and Dennis J. Horan
(Sheed & Ward, 1972), Hilgers
does an essay “The Medical
Hazards of Legally Induced Abor-
tion” in which I excerpted some of
his key quotes, giving the specific
references for them, to point out
how dangerous abortion is. There
are 179 footnotes in his book, too
much to reproduce. I brieﬂy
mentioned things like sterility and
such things since it gets wild and
hairy to quote extensively, supply-
ing footnotes. Hilgers’ biblio-
graphy will give you a sampling of
pro-life documents and articles
which negates this pharse: “there
is absolutely no evidence...”
Perhaps no evidence exists for you,
Roger, because you do not wish to
admit their existence. As far as the
Rh-sensitization goes, there are
certain women who are Rh
negative, who tend to develop
antibodies against their child which
can destroy the child’s red blood
cells. First-borns are rarely
effected, but subsequent preg-
nancies can mean mental and
motor retardation. Anti-Rh-
negative gammaglobulin (Rhogam)
has been developed to treat this,
but Hilgers remarks (p. 74): “In a
study conducted by the New ‘York
State Department of Health of
women having abortions in all of
New York State 48.7% of women
known to be Rh negative were left
untreated, and thus unprotected

from the possibility of sensitization’

and its inherent risks in future
pregnancies (l45).”

I’ll be in contact with you about
the debate. My meagre back-
ground in pro-life demands that

experts speak, but I'll be a youth:
representative of pro-life, a partici.
pant-observer, to bear out my
testimony. You asked for a debate.
Well. if you accept my terms,'this
campus will see one of the most
hard-hitting, power-packed, and
controversial scenes ever.

As you said: It is time to put-up
or shut-up!

JAMES A. BUZONAS
STUDENTS FOR HUMAN LIFE

Hitching

Dear Editor:

I noted I with interest your
reference to Edmonto, Alberta, as I
have just returned from a year in
that city. Hitchhiking is quite
common in Edmonton. However, I
disagree that the practices you cite
from the “wilds of Canada" (your
phrase, not mine) apply I anyway
to Pittsburgh or the University of
Pittsburgh. Just because space
suits are worn on the moon does
not mean they should be worn
here.

Let me expound and, perhaps,
clarify.

For many reasons, the U.S. citi-
zenry's attitude to automobiles,
pedestrians. strangers, and women
is different from the Canadians’
attitude. If we compare the
Eastern U.S. and Western Canada,
this difference is even more
pronounced. It makes hitchhiking
and picking-up-hitchhikers a totally
different thing in the two regions.

Consider: In Edmonton pedestri-
ans have the right-of-way over
motorists. In Canada the govern-
ment encourages and subsidizes
hitchhiking through the Canadian
Youth Hostels Association which
provides free or near-free lodging
and cheap meals in the park areas
and the major cities. In Edmonton
there are relatively fewer “full-
time” motorists [Full-time motor-
ists cannot be trusted. Witness
their disgusting behavior in the
pedestrian crosswalk between
Schenley Union and the Cathedral
of Leaming.] and relatively more
full-time pedestrians than in
Pittsburgh.

These contrasts which I have cited
contribute to a totally different
attitude toward hitchhiking. There

are other differences. Trafﬁc
moves faster in Edmonton. The
terrain is. different (I once drove
four miles out of my way to take

three thumbers home to an area of '

Edmonton I’d never been in before.
Imagine trying that in Pittsburgh.)

1 do agree with your idea about
hitchhiking zones, but not with
your use of the University of
Alberta’s practice to support the
idea. The hitchhiking zone idea
(put into effect more than a year
ago--where did you get that AP
story?) didn’t work out too well in
Edmonton, partly because it’s so
easy to get rides there that few
persons used the zone. Since it is
harder to get rides here and since
Pitt has a more compact campus
than the University of Alberta,’ it
might work.

Finally, the last sentence of your
Column-And-A-Half begins, “If
our city: is "more backward than
Edmonton, Alberta,...” The
implication of this clause is that
Edmonton is backward. Can you
support your implied contention?
Is this perhaps excessive national-
ism on your part as was, perhaps,
the phrase “wilds of Canada?” Or
were you just trying to be funny?

There is a type of so-called humor,
prevalent on the U.S. television,
which is based on the assumption
that the audience splits into two
groups. The first group accepts the
remark at face value. The second

-.Dr.Frie e PoysHomoge to SoIvadorA ende

BY RICHARD SWARTZ

Dr. A..l. Friele, a professor of
political geography at Pitt and a
lifelong associate of the late
Chilean Marxist President, Salva-
dor Allende Gossens, meditated
upon the circumstances surround-
ing the ruler’s life, struggles, and
sudden death, which sounded the
end of this turbulent three-year
administration last Tuesday.

Friele, whose friendship with
Allende flowered upon their initial
encounter in 1936 at the founding
of Gossens’ Chilean Socialist party,
characterized his colleague as “one
of the most clever politicians I have
ever met in my life.

“He always declared his strong,
Marxist convictions, and he lived
up to his promises,” Friele
reflected. “He was a man who
knew how to run a person with his
left hand and work him with his
right. Nobody can deny he tried to
feed the people properly and to
raise the salaries of the poor
workers."

Friele concurred with the opin-
ions registered by Prof. Osvaldo
Sunkel, a Chilean economist, that
despite the many failings and
errors committed by Allende’s
administration, “it attempted to

redress (the Chilean) economic and
and social structure by funda-
mentally democratic means."
“He fiilfulled his promises of a
national milk program and con-
tinued the nationalization reforms
started by his predecessor, Frei,"

Friele rejoined._ “He was
essentially an honest leader.”
Friele also elaborated upon

Sunkelis contentions that the role
of the multinational corporations in
Chile during Allende‘s reign had a
significant impact on the collapse
of Chile’s experiment with a
popularly elected government.
“The multinational corporations
have no nationality whatsoever.
Unfortunately, the United States
government is backing these
corporations,” Friele affirmed.
“Among some of the more
well-known are IT&T and United
Fruit. But there are others such as
Kennecott and Anaconda that
people do not know about.
“These corporations are hurting
the political status of the U.S.
government. They have done
almost every absolutely inconceiv-
able thing to gain a few more
dollars; actually, in this case, it’s a
few more billion dollars," he
maintained. “So on the one hand,

  Letters to the Editor

group laughs (with the narrator) at
the first group.

This type of humor is okay, I
suppose, if “everybody” agrees
that the first group deserves to be
laughed at. Do you think the set of
persons who believe that Edmon-
ton is a backward city in the wilds
of Canada deserve to be laughed
at?

I think they deserve pity. Along
with those who think’ that “Our
medical care is the best in the

400 SCHENLEY HALL

world.” Or “Our electrical power

is the best and cheapest in the

world.” Or “Only in America--”
Well?

Martin Marsden
Mathematician

we are the ‘big givers’, and on the
other hand. we are the ‘big
takers."'

Friele advocated that the federal
government should divest itself of
any responsibility whatsoever for
the actions of these mammoth
corporations, and let the Chileans
deal with them as they see fit.

Friele was also highly critical of
the official State Department
reaction to the coup d’ etat. He
scoffed at any notions that the U.S.
government had prior knowledge of
the military’s overthrow attempt.
This contradicts published reports
whch alleged that Washington did
have advanced notice, but refused
to intervene.

He ridiculed the State Depart-
ment’s refusal to offer its sym-
pathies to Allende’s widow.

“That is a very bad move,”
Frield lamented. “It is customary
that when a Head of State dies, no
matter if he is your enemy, the
State Department expresses its
condolences. Particularly when he
dies this way.”

Friele, wounded by the earlier
assertions of Dr. Hugo Nutini, a
Pitt anthropology professor, who
stated that Allende was not an
influential Chilean ﬁgure until his
coalition solidified in 1970, re-
sponded sharply to Nutini’s de-
claration.

“Nutini has no right to say a
thing or a word about Allende. He

“Balance” Tips the Scales

BY M.C. PILECKI

The movie fan who goes to a
“sneak preview” is taking a
gamble. He pays his money to see
a flick--title unknown--not yet
shown in the area. Often he comes
out ahead on the deal getting an
early look at a good ﬁlm.
Sometimes he just plain loses.

Persons who -attended the

g Chatham Cinema’s sneak last week

felt deprived of more than the price
of _ admission. The movie, a
subtitled Swedish import named
The Indelicate Balance, was so bad
that one point when the screen
went dark, the audience applaud-
ed. When the ﬁlm resumed, there
was weeping and the gnashing of
teeth.

Blance used a slight variation on
the standard movie theme: boy
meets girl, boy marries girl, boy
screws mother, girl screws sister-in
law, etc. Never has sex been so
boring and badly done.

Usually, when a ﬂick is really

i bad, it’s funny. The best this flick

could produce was periodic burst of
accidental humor, such as that
occasioned the love-starved-sheep
look of the mother as she seduces
her son.

The music is inappropriately
overdramatic, the acting is on the
level of a kindergarten Christmas
pageant, and even the quality of
the print is poor. The film’s
greatest asset is that it makes every
other movie you’ve seen look good.

One unlucky member of the
audience, on hearing that the film
was rated “R,” commented “It
should have rated ‘DG,’ for ‘don’t
go9.99

The Chatham gets a chance to
redeem its reputation (tainted by
its recent bad luck at the box ofﬁce)
with its newest, Bang The Drum
Slowly. It’s not really that great a
ﬂick, but in a baseball town like
Pittsburgh it should go over well.

At ﬁrst glance, Drum seems like
baseball’s version of Brian’s Song,
although the original novel pre-
dates the award-winning TV movie.

It concerns the close friendship of
Arthur, Michael Moriarty, and
Bruce, Robert DiNiro, a shrewd
successful pitcher and a naive,
not-so-great catcher, respectively,
for the New York Mammoths.

The movie begins with the pair
learning that Bruce is dying from a
rare disease--unnamed until nearly
the end. Some of the dialogue at
this point is downright embaras-
sing, and seems like Sports
lllustratedfs version of Love Story
for pure schmaltz.

Fortunately, it picks up, and the
movie is a very good look at the
inner workings of baseball. Arthur
‘is the “new”.-modern player:
college-educated, career-minded,
nicely contrasted to the “old”
traditional, backwoods boy Bruce,
uneducated, undirected, and gen-
erally “out of it.”

The story is often juvenile: the

dying Bruce has his greatest
season of his career, even when
delirious, and the Mammoths win it
all. But the acting is generally
good, as ,is the study of
relationships of‘ such a social
phenomonom as a travelling sports
team. The presentation of
desparate members of a group
uniting in a common goal and
seeking to overcome personal
difficulties is the movie's strongest
point, and makes it worth seeing.

Non-sports fans may not appre-
ciate Drum, or even understand the
many baseball details, so be
warned. But in the waning days of
the baseball season, Bang The
Drum Slowly is sure to ﬁnd an
audience in Pittsburgh.

ATHENS, Ga’. - As Secretariat was winning the Marlboro Cup
Saturday, a horse called “Annihilate ‘Em” finished out of the money.
At about theisame time that day, Johnny Majors discovered that the
Georgia Bulldogs were not going to annihilate the Pitt Panthers, and‘
that there aren’t many teams in the nation who can.

Pitt went into that game as 17-point underdogs, and the 7-7 final
score did not reflect the degree to which the Panthers outmuscled the
Bulldogs. As a Clemson scout put it after the game, “Pitt kicked their
butts. It will go down in history that in their 1973 opener, Georgia had
their butts kicked."

All of those grueling drills in the blistering heat of Johnstown paid
off. “We were in better shape at the end of the game than Georgia
was,” declared assistant head coach Jackie Sherrill.

Throughout the afternoon, the fans and the Georgia team were
waiting for the Cats to tire from the 85-degree temperature. It was the
Georgia Dogs that did the tiring.

The Panthers dominated the Bulldogs in every statistical area except
one, punting. Freshman Larry Swider, understandably nervous,
averaged 32.6 yards for his eleven kicks, nearly ten yards shorter than
Bulldog Don Golden’s 42.6.

The Pitt defense was unbelievable. In the first half, All-American
candidate Andy Johnson threw seven passes, and the only one he
completed was a backﬁeld pass to tailback Jimmy Poulos, who was hit
immediately for a seven yard loss. The compliment Majors paid
Georgia before the game must now apply to Pitt as well. You can't
move the ball up and down the ﬁeld on the Panthers.

Majors called the Cats’ play Saturday, “the most outstanding team
performance I’ve ever witnessed, as a coach or a player.” Although
the players still wanted a victory, the Pitt locker room scene after the
game was that of a winner. The Georgia locker room was reminiscent
of a funeral home.

The Panthers did come much closer to winning the game than
Georgia did. With 3: 10 left in the game. Carson Long was sent in to try
a 32-yard field goal. The snap to holder Billy Daniels was very low, and
Daniels amazingly got the ball onto the tee, although in a crooked
fashion. Long’s kick was definitely high enough, but was Wide t0 the
right. _

Long was quite unhappy after the kick, but the miss was not his fault
at all. A placekicker starts his motion as soon as the ball is hiked. If
the snap from center is bad, there’s not enough time for the kicker to
adjust. “When I saw the snap, I didn't think we were going to get the
kick off," recalled Majors.

Long’s kickoffs, by the way, were excellent. The opening kickoff of
the game went to the goaline, and was returned to the 19. The kick-off

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

Athens. Ga. -- A new football
coach with some new players and a
season opener; add some rigorous
pre-season training and condition-
ing with enthusiasm and you have
the ingredients that sent the
Georgia Bulldogs limping out of
Sanford Stadium amidst a chorus of
hometown boos after tying Pitt.
7-7.

Bulldog coach Vince Dooley
warned his team last week saying,
“I tried to tell everyone you never
know about a new team with a new
coach and a lot of spirit.
Apparently, I didn't get through to
anyone." ,

,_Dooley's laments could have
been worse. Pitt barely missed
winning the contest when freshman
placekicker Carson Long's 34 yard
field goal attempt with 3:25 left to
play in the game went wide to the
right. Long got the kick off even
though the snap from center was
low and Bill Daniels did a good job
just teeing the ball up.

The game opened, and closed, as
a battle of defenses. After Pitt
kicked off to open the game, the
Bulldogs were assessed 15 yards
and a loss of a down on the first
play from scrimmage for offensive
pass interference.

After a Georgia punt, the
Panthers took over at their own 38
yard line and quarterback Bill
Daniels guided the Pitt offense to
immediate success. Daniels let
freshman Tony Dorsett make his
collegiate debut on the ﬁrst Cat
play and the celebrated high school
star proved to be the backbone of
the offense. Dorsett tallied 101
yards in 26 attempts for the
afternoon.

A pair of Dorsett runs (for five
yards) and a pass to tight end Stan
Ostrowski put the Panthers into
Bulldog territory at the Georgia 44
yard line. An illegal procedure
penalty (one of many called on Pitt)
put the Cats back to the Bulldog 49
and Daniels went to Dorsett once
again, for two yards. .

The Georgia front defense held
the Pitt backs in between the forty
yard lines so Daniels went to the
air. This time ﬂanker Todd
Toerper hauled in the pass for an
11 yard gain. On third and two,
Daniels sent fullback Dave Janasek
up the middle but the play fell short
of a first down by one foot. With
the ball at the Georgia 36 and
fourth down, Pitt coach Johnny
Majors elected to go for it. Daniels
stretched over the middle of the
stacked Bulldog defense on a sneak
and picked up the necessary
yardage with room to spare.

Dorsett then scampered around
the left end on a pitch out for 9
yards to the Georgia 24. Janasek
took the ball up the middle again
for three tough yards and another

Pitt first down. Dorsett slanted off
right tackle for four yards to begin
the series but the highlight of the
drive came on the following play.

Daniels. who earned the number
one quarterback job and Majors’
praise in pre-season camp, rolled
left on an option, kept the ball and
deftly manuevered into the corner
of the end zone past a flat-footed
Bulldog defense. Long split the
uprights as the 52,005 spectators
fell silent with Pitt leading, 7-0.

Long’s following kickoff sailed
high to the goal line and excellent
Pitt coverage nailed Dick Conn at
his own 12. The Panther defense
once again stopped Bulldog
quarterback Andy Johnson and Co.
and the punting battle began.

Both clubs exchanged a pair of
punts but the Bulldogs got a break
late in the first quarter when
Freshman Pitt punter Larry Swider
shanked the ball to the right, giving
Georgia excellent field position at
the Cat 47.

On fourth and two at the Pitt 21,
the Cats were called for illegal
procedure and the Bulldog attack
stayed alive. Fullback Horace King
and tailback Jimmy Poulis com-
bined to take the ball down to the
Pitt four yard line and Johnson
wiggled over on a quarterback
sneak. The Bulldogs converted and
with 14:16 left in the half the
scoring ended for the afternoon.

After exchanging punts again,
Pitt drove down to the Bulldog 30
but a Daniels’ pass was deﬂected at
the line of scrimmage by Bulldog
Jim Cagle and then picked off by
Keith Harris to stop the drive.

The two teams exchanged punts
and this time it was Pitt’s turn to
grab an interception. Dennis
Moorehead picked off the first of
two Johnson passes at the Pitt 33
and returned it for six yards. Pitt
failed to move the Georgia defense
and Swider saw action for the sixth
time in the first half. The Bulldogs
elected to run out the clock, in
respect to the power of the
Panthers.

Early in the third quarter
Johnson went for the bomb but
Moorehead picked off his second
interception of the day. The
Panthers couldn’t capitalize on the
break and Swider was called into
service again. The froshi punter
was having a bad day but managed
to get a fairly high, twisting boot
that resulted in a Georgia fumble
and a Pitt recovery.

Pitt started the series in Bulldog
territory but wound up on the other
side of the midfield stripe when
fourth down rolled around, forcing

Boas Do wn 0n Dogs

Swider to punt again. This time he
put the foot into it and the ball
bounced inside the ten but the Pitt
specialty squad failed to down the
ball before it skipped into the end
zone.

After another exchange of kicks,
Pitt started a drive from their own
18 yard line. Bill Englert got the
call at fullback and split the middle
of the Georgia defense for an 28
yard gain. Englert might have

., gone all the way but was tripped up

by one of his teammates, who was
leading the blocking for him.

The Cats edged into Bulldog
territory once more but were
immediately shut off. Swider had
another opportunity to kick for the
coffin corner but the pressures of
his first collegiate action were
reflected in another poor kick, this
one of 15 yards.

The defensive units for both
sides took over and the punters saw
more action. The Bulldogs almost
received another break via a Pitt
frosh when Bob Haywood fumbled
a Don Golden punt on the Pitt 17
but managed to fall on the loose
ball. The Cats then marched to
their last scoring opportunity, the
Long field goal attempt, but again
did not get the breaks going their
way.

The Dogs took over but a few
plays later fell victim to their own
mistakes when a Johnson to Rich
Appleby pass was caught, then
fumbled and recovered by Rod
Kirby at midfield. Once more on
the attack. Daniels threw the final
interception of the day to end Pitt's
scoring threat.

Johnson tried desperately for a
last minute score via passing but
the Pitt defense dropped into
prevent and allowed the Dogs to
complete the short passes, shutting
the door on the long threat.
Johnson cranked up a last second
bomb in desperation but the ball
fell into a crowd, incomplete.

“There’s no way to express what
our performance meant to me,”
Majors said in the locker room after
the game, a locker room that looked
more like a winners. “It’s the most
outstanding performance I’ve seen
as a coach or a player.”

Statiscally, Pitt won the battle:
rushing, 225 yards to 174, passing,
60 yards to 56 and first downs,
.14-12. Daniels was 6 for 17 passing
with two interceptions while
Johnson was 7 of 19 with a pair of
interceptions.

More appropriately, or according
to Coach Dooley, “Pitt just kicked
the hell out of us."

(Continued from Page 

following the Panther touchdown was taken by Bulldog Horace King on
the three, and he was tackled at the 12. Long’s kicks had height as well
as distance, and the Pitt specialty teams covered the kicks superbly.

The Pitt offense moved well, considering that it was going up against
a strong Bulldog defense. Daniels ran the team smoothly. He ran the
option play particularly well, and when he didn't keep the ball, he had
number 33, Tony Dorsett, to pitch to. Dorsett, in his college debut,
netted 101 yards. “It was a good start,” related a cool Dorsett on the
return flight.

The Pitt Panthers are a completely different team from last season.
In just_ one game, Majors has revived all the past glory that is
associated with Pitt football.

When the fourth quarter began, the entire Pitt squad had their heads
up high, their hands proclaiming that it was the fourth quarter, and
that Pitt was very much in the football game. I

When the game ended, the Georgia faithful hung their heads low as
they slowly left Sanford Stadium, and even the Bulldog atop the
scoreboard seemed sad, as if the Jungle Cats had ruined a season that
just began.

Ionically, the Dogs may have sealed their own fate. Late in the
game, the clock was not stopped for Pitt first-downs, as it should have,
and the extra time may have come in handy for Georgia, as their final
drive ended when the clock ran out.

Guard Reynold Stoner summed up the significance of Saturday’s
game. “Against Georgia, we learned how not to lose. When we play
Baylor this Saturday, we’re going to learn how to win.”

One thing's for sure, Majors doesn't have to worry about getting
annihilated.

Bucknell Takes Piﬂ Gift

BY YAIER LEHRER

The score is tied at 0-0, there are
six seconds to go in the soccer
game. but suddenly Pitt scores to
make it 1-Qand Bucknell wins the
game.

Yes, Pitt scored and lost,
because the goal the Panthers
scored had found its way into their
own net, handing Bucknell the
victory on a silver platter.

Evidently, there was a cross-up
of signals when one of the Panther
defensemen kicked the ball back
towards the net so that goalie Bill
Haines could handle it and kick it
out of the Pitt zone.

Haines said that he had it and
that the rest of the Pitt booters
should let it go, but Chester
Venanzi, either in an effort to get
the ball to Hanies a little quicker,
or just not having heard Haines,
gave it a little push, but instead of
the ball going to Haines, the ball
trickled into the side of the net,
giving the Bisons the winning
margin.

This is not in any way to demean
the play of either the Bucknell team
or the play of the Panther defense.

It was the defensive play of
Fernando Cariguiry that was a

. constant thorn in the side of the

Bisons. Every time it looked like
the Bucknell team was mounting a
successful rush on the Pitt goal,
Fernando, with help from Ray Rex,
would clear it out of the goal area
and stop the scoring threat.

Even with some good Panther
defensive play, it was the Bucknell
offense that clearly dominated the
game with an organized passing
attack. ,

The Pitt team was only able to
get one shot on goal through the
entire first half, but that shot was a
good one by Dennis Kohlmeyer,
only to be blocked on a great save
by Petterson, the Bucknell goalie.

Bill Haines also had a good day
in goal, contending with a lot of
pressure by the opposing team,

and making an excellent save on a
shot by Matt Lowe of Bucknell in
the second half.

The Cats had one other chance to
score, and they missed that one by
inghes as Alan Jutca fed the ball in
from the left side but Joe
Luxbacher was just a second too
slow and missed the head shot into
the goal.

“Joe had to slow down quite a bit
today,” said Coach Bemis. “He
was playing with a pulled groin
muscle and couldn’t play up to his
potential.”

The biggest problem for the Cats
was that they couldn’t seem to play
together and establish a good
passing attack, while the Bisons
were able to play together using a
pin-point passing attack but just
not being able to score on the home
team.

“They just outplayed us,” Bemis

told his players after the game,
“and we made a couple of mistakes
but it only took that one mistake to
beat us.”

“l’ve been trying to teach them
all this time that you don't kick
back to the goalie,” Bemis
commented, “and I don’t think
you’ll be seeing it happen again
after what went on today.”

There were a couple of times

when it looked like the Panthers

might be coming to life and gaining
some momentum, but they were
foiled at every turn by a tough
Bucknell defense.

The goal, credited to Scott

Strausberg of Bucknell for the _

record books, was the first one
scored against a Pitt soccer team by
Bucknell in three years. Maybe
two ties in one weekend was too
much to ask.

 

The ball attracts a crowd in front of the Pitt goal and three Pitt
fullbacks race to the defense. The booters lost to Bucknell Saturday at
Pitt Stadium on a fluke play that involved a Pitt booter putting in the

goal in his own net.

an excellent team effort, , what

really defeated the Georgia Bull-'

dogs was the Pittsburgh Mad

that has been given to Pitt's

“We're going to get a lot
better," promised a satisfied

It had been a trademark of Pitt
teams to collapse in the second

reduced to three. The three varsity
sports represented will be:
gymnastics, basketball and swim-
ming. Volleyball, a former varsity

"Q-sport is included in long-range

 

plans for expansion along with
tennis and fencing.

Ms. Margaret E. Covert, Co-
ordinator of Intercollegiate Sports
for Women at Pitt, stated that the
budget is holding back expansion.
She further explained that by
concentrating funds in these three
sports, those who qualify for
eastern and national championship
meets can be assured the expenses
to attend and compete.

The Association of Inter-
collegiate Athletics for Women

r ﬁnalized policies on scholarships

for women. Previously, under
AIAW rules, no athletic scholar-
ships could be given to women.
Under present rules, scholarships
are now allowed and several
colleges and universities around
the country are already granting
aid to women.

“We have no athletic scholar-
ships for women at the present
time, but we are hopeful to make

these available in the near future,”
added Ms. Covert. '

New to the coaching staff this
year is Ms. Deborah Wells, taking
over as gymnastics coach for Ms.
Gail DiCicco. Anxious to begin a
successful new season, Ms. Wells
will begin practices on Monday,
Sept. 17. Returning as basketball
coach is Ms. Sandy Bullman.
Workouts will begin later in the
fall. Also returning this year is Ms.
Virginia Grindle as coach of the
swim team. The swimmer’s season
has been expanded this year. The
season begins in October and
extends into March, aiming at the
eastern and national championship
meets.

All women interested in joining a
varsity team should contact its
respective coach at ext. 4397, Trees

Georgia was,” said Sherrill.

Another factor that contributed
to the Panther victory was Majors’
tricking Georgia into thinking Pitt
was running a four-four defense.
“We were expecting an eight-man
defense (four-four),” admitted
Dooley. “We sure were surprised
when Pitt came out with a
five-two.”

The Mad Dogs’ pass defense was
the dominant factor of the game.
Bulldog quarterback Andy John-
son, an All-American candidate,
completed , seven of nineteen
passes, and most of these came in
the final few minutes, when short
passes had to be conceded.
Georgia gained only 56 yards in the
air, the longest single play a

14-yarder.
In the first half, Johnson threw
seven times, and the only

completion resulted in a seven-yard
loss, as Monster Mike Bulino
whistled in to greet tailback Jimmy
Poulos almost as soon as Johnson’s
flair-pass reached him.

Defensive secondary coach Joe
Madden, who naturally deserved a
lot of credit for the play of his
charges, attributed the success to
the entire defensive unit. “The
whole team did an outstanding
job,” he said. “The front line put a
lot of pressure on, and the backs
were just great. We were alert
from the first play on, and it’s a
good thing we were.”‘..

Having been assured by Geor-
gia’s assistant sports information
director, Bill Hartman, that the
Bulldog’s first play would be an
off-tackle slant, and that I should so

inform Majors, I wasn't totally
surprised when Johnson faked the
up-the-middle play, then uncorked
along pass to Poulos. Fortunately,
Panther safety Dennis Moorehead
was also alert, and he easily broke
up the pass. “We were well
prepared mentally and physically,”
summed up Madden.

The secondary contributed many
key tackles to go along with its
excellent pass coverage. Bulino

had six unassisted'Tackles, and
Moorehead, whose key second

quarter interception thwarted a
Georgia drive, had three solo
tackles. A blend of the old and new
Panther, Rod Kirby and Kelcy

Daviston, each participated in
eleven tackles, high for either
team.

When the Bulldogs tried to run
up the middle, they. discovered an
immovable fortress called Gary
Burly, and it only moved when it
wanted to. On many passing
occasions, that fortress decided to
pay a visit to the quarterback, and
Johnson often found himself gazing
at the Georgia sky immediately
after releasing the football.

Burley, the top-ranked junior
college linebacker from Columbus,
Ohio, made four solo tackles and

_ sure thought it was,”

assisted on four more. “Gary
controlled the center of the line,"
drawled Sherrill.

The defense’s seven-point yield
surpassed last year's low-mark of
ten against Syracuse, and it could
very easily be that low again.

Dog Tracks -- Opinions varied on
whether the Johnstown training
camp was hotter than athens. “I
said Tony
Dorsett. “It’s much more humid
down here,” said coach George
Haffner, who called down plays
from the air-conditioned press box.
“I broke out into a sweat in the
pre-game warmups.”....The Pitt
players, trainers, managers, and
cheerleaders all wore visors to
shield them from the sun's
scorching rays....While traveling to
and from the stadium, hotel, and
airport, the team’s buses were
escorted by the Georgia Highway
Patrol.....Ugga III, Georgia’s mas-
cot, spent most of the game in his
giant fire hydrant, having little
cause to come out during the
afternoon....The largest group ever
to attend an away game alumni
function showed up at the Athens
Holiday Inn for a pre-game brunch.
