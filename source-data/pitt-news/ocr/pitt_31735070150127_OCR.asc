President Barack’ Obama and Re-
publican presidential nominee Mitt
Romney revamped their’ arguments
against each other’s policies dur-
ing the second presidential debate
Tuesday night at Hofstra University
in New York. _ A

Afterwhatwas widely considered
an underwhelming performance in
the previous debate by Obama, the
president attacked Romney for what
he called an economic plan that laid
the burden of budget-balancing ma-
neuvers on the backs of middle-class
families.

Jeremy Epstein, a college student,
posed the ﬁrst question for the two
candidates, asking them how they
planned to reduce college graduate
unemployment, an issue that has
been hotly debated between Obama
and Romney throughout the cam-
paign season. =

Both men acknowledged the nee
to create new j obs that would require
skilled workers with college degrees.
Romney used the question as an op-
portunity to bash Obama’s term in
ofﬁce. ’ ' V

“The middle class has been
crushed over the last four years, and
jobs have been too scarce,” Romney
said. “I knowwhat it takes to get them
back, and I’m going to do that.”

Countering Romney, Obama said
he “wanted to build manufacturing
jobs in this country again,” While

gNobel Prize

. Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sci-
ences announced on Monday that
former Pitt professor Alvin Roth

had won the Nobel Prize for his _

decades of work using economics
to efficiently match people with
services they need.

Roth, 61, shares the honor

of winning the Nobel Memorial ‘

Prize in Economic Sciences and
the $1.2 million prize attached to
that honor_with Lloyd Shapley, 89,
professor emeritus at the UCLA.
Roth Worked on the application,
and Shapley worked on thetheory
of allocating resources through a
matching process.

“Even though thesevtwo re-
searchers worked independently

of one another, the combination of .

Shapley’s basic theory and Roth’s
empirical investigations, experi-
ments and practical design has
generated a ﬂourishing ﬁeld of
research and improved the per-
formance of many markets. This
year’s prize is awarded for an out-
standing example of economic
engineering,” The Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences said in a press

' release announcing the winners.

During his tenure at Pitt, which
spanned from 1982 to 1998, Roth
held the position of Andrew W.
Mellon Professor of Economics. At
Pitt he devised a system to match
kidney donors with those in need
of a donation. This project was
one of the earlier aspects of the
work that ultimately earned him
the prize this week.

Students might be able to swipe into Market
Central with less of a burden on their bank
accounts next year.

Student Government Board member Ju-
lie Hallinan announced proposed meal plan
changes to an audience of about 20 people
gathered in Nordy’s Place Tuesday night for
the Student Government Board meeting. The
Board is responsible for distributing ﬁmds
from the more than $2 million Student Ac-
tivities Fund. ’ _

Hallinan met with Jim Earle, director of

Housing and Food Services, and Sodexo rep- '

resentatives to discuss meal plan changes that

would reduce current plan options and adjust '
the meal prices per swipe. The issue of meal *“

plans has been one that past Board members
have talked about in their campaigns. . -

“Now we are seeing that many plans have
costs of over $10 per swipe, and one even has
an average cost of $14 per swipe,” Hallin
said. -

As the system stands now, there are ﬁve
options for students selecting meal plans: an

Ultimate Access Tier allowing for unlimited‘

dining hall swipes, three dining pass tiers that

‘ allow for respectively lower amounts of din-

ing swipes, and an apartment residents and
commuter meal plan for students who reside
off campus. _
Proposed changes would remove one of
the three dining pass tier options and would

require on-campus sophomores to join fresh- ‘

man in purchasing within the top-two dining
pass tier options.

Hallinan said that this change would not
be an extreme alteration from current student
selections and that she is optimistic about the

City police blocked off part of North Belle-

squad detonated two bottles of soda that
had been turned into explosives.

Detective Michael Burns said police re-
ceived the report at about 7:30 p.m. when
someone heard an explosioncoming from
the bushes near 130 N. Belleﬁeld Ave.

When police arrived on the scene, they
learned that one soda bottle had exploded
and saw two more soda bottles expanding.
According to Burns, soda bottles can ex-
plode when their contents are mixed with
aluminum foil.

“Depending on whether they put shrap-

To avoid any potential for danger, the ,

police bomb squad detonated the other two

Panel discusses lessons learned from Cuban Missile Crisis

Kathleen Fennel]
For The Pitt News

Fifty years ago this week, the United States
and the Soviet Union faced a nuclear weap-
ons standoff in the cold waters near Cuba.

In the time since the Cuban Missile Cri-
sis, students of history have uncovered
many hidden details about the events sur-
rounding the 13-day confrontation, but
more secrets are left to unravel, according
to expert Peter Kornbluh.

Kornbluh, a senior analyst at the Na-
tional Security Archive, gave the keynote
speech at the Graduate School of Inter-
national and Public Affair’s Matthew B.’
Ridgway Center for International Security
Studies’ daylong event titled “Cuban Mis-
sile Crisis: 5o Year Anniversary”..

In hisrrole with the National Security

Archive, Kornbluh directs the Cuba, Chile ,

and Brazil Documentation Projects, which
aim to open formerly secretive documents
surrounding foreign affairs for public con-
sumption. He participated in the confer-
ence marking the 40th anniversary of the

’ Cuban Missile Crisis in the presence of

American, Soviet and Cubanleaders, and
speciﬁcs about the historical event contin-
ued to be revealed.

Phil Williams, the director of the Ridg-
way Center, introduced Kornbluh as an
“incredible fountain of knowledge.”

“Fifty years down the road, we are still
learning new things about the Cuban Mis-
sile Crisis,” Kornbluh told an audience of
about 40 people.

He revealed that historians have dis-
covered that the crisis was much more
dangerous than U.S. officials understood
at the time. ‘

Kornbluh stressed that officials kept
certain aspects of the Cuban Missile Cri-
sis secret, which led historians and the

public to draw skewed conclusions from"

the event, but 50 years later, with more
evidence, we can come to a more complete
determination.

For instance, he described the deal
President John F. Kennedy made with
Soviet leaders to remove United States
missiles from Turkey in exchange for the
withdrawal of missiles in Cuba. Kennedy
did so without the majority of his advisers’
approval, and the deal was kept a secret

and even left out of the president’s book, _

which was perceived as containing the most
accurate depiction of the crisis.

Kornbluh acknowledged that diplomacy «
 often cannot be open to the public at the

time of such crises and “in this day and
age, we see secret diplomacies going on
all the time,” but in the context of history,
oﬂicials need to reveal such details for the
world to learn from them.

Historians frequently list dumb luck as a

factor in the peaceful resolve of the Cuban
Missile Crisis, but Kornbluh disagreed with
this analysis.
“Looking at the entire record, luck had
little to do with the resolution,” he said.
He chose instead to focus on Kennedy’s
commitment toward ending the crisis as a
major factor in the peaceful outcome.
Kornbluh concluded his speech with the
remark, “We all were the winners of the
Cuban Missile Crisis,” and proceeded to
answer questions from the audience, which
allowed him to expand on his understand-
ing of the role Fidel Castro played in the
crisis, the causes that lead to the event and
the multiple facets of diplomatic secrecy.
In addition to Kornbluh’s keynote
speech, the conference included several
speeches by experts on the crisis, includ-
ing Pitt faculty members, and a conclud-

.ing paneldiscussion, which scrutinized

the crisis, the context of recent research
surrounding the crisis while also focusing
on ways the information derived from the
crisis can be used in the future.

Before giving Kornbluh the stage, Wil-
liams touched on 21st century aspects that
could affect the nature of any future crisis
of international affairs. He pointed to con-
cepts such as the larger number of players
on the world stage, the level of improved

NOBEL 

spent more than a decade teaching at Har-
vard Business School. He left that position
this fall for a teaching position at Stanford
University.

Roth earned his doctorate in operations
research from Stanford University In 1974.

Over the course of his career, Roth has
also teamed up with other economists to
work on systems that match American
medical students with residency programs
and New York public school students with
schools.

Roth explained the nature of his work in

_ an interview with NobelPrize.com on the

morning he learned that he earned the prize.

‘He exempliﬁed the concept of students being

matched with a school in order to explain his
work. He said students will put forth their
school preferences, and schools will present
their student requirements. Through match-
ing economics, Roth’s system determines
which student will go to which school.

“That’s what matching’s about. Who gets
what. We try to make that happen in a way
that’s efﬁcient,” Roth said.

In a post on his blog yesterday, Roth com-
mented on his Nobel Prize achievement. '

“Well, I had an unusual day yesterday.
But I’m not much further along digesting
it,” he wrote. I

Romney wanted to “let Detroit go bankrupt”

‘ — a reference to a New York Times column _

written by Romney in 2008 that advocated

a structured bankruptcy for General Motors. I
Obama and Romney also clashed over for-

eign policy, focusing speciﬁcally on the death of

- late U.S. Ambassador to Syria]. Christopher Ste-

vens. Defending his administration’s response, .
Obama said Romney attempted “to score politi-
cal poin ” after Stevens’ death.

“That’s not how a commander in chief op-
erates. You don’t turn national security issues
into a political issue, certainly not right when
it’s happening,” Obama said.

Romney responded by criticizing Obama’s
choice to campaign in Los Angeles and Las Vegas
just days after Stevens’ death.

As he responded to Romney’s criticism over
his campaigning,'Obama characterized the kill-
ing of Stevens and four other Americans as “an
act ofterrorism,” a remark that Romney said
differed from the administration’s original label-
ing of the attacks as spontaneous.

erator Candy Crowley, who said Obama called
the attacks an “act of terrorism” in the days

A after the attacks.

Aswasthe casein the previousldebate, much
of the back and forth between Romney and
Obama focused on each candidates’ economi_c
policies.

Repeatinga claim he’s made throughout the
campaign season, Obama said Romney’s tax '

plan disproportionately favors those earning
over $250,000 per year.

“[Romney] was on ‘60 Minutes’ just two '

weeks ago, and he was asked, ‘Is it fair for some-
body making $20 million a year to pay a lower
tax rate than a nurse or abus driver, somebody
making $50,000 ayear‘?”’ Obama said. “And he
said, “Yes, I think that’s fair.’”

Romney ﬁred backat Obama, saying his plan
supported small businesses across the country

by loweringtax rates and thereby encouraging '

growth. -

' “If you bring [tax] rates down, it makes it
easier for small business to keep more of their
capital and hire people,” Romney said. ‘And for
me,‘ this is about jobs. I want to get America’s
economy going again.”

Obama and Romney will participate in their
ﬁnal debate on Oct. 22. I

But Obama asked forclariﬁcaﬁonfrom mod-

proposed pricings. '

“Most sophomores already do buy plans in
those upper tiers,” she said. “I was so pumped
leaving that meeting. I will he graduated next
year, so I won’t be here to experience these
changes. But all underclassmen will, and I’m
working with [the Resident Student Asso-
ciation] to get the word out and get student
inpu .7’

Hallinan said that Earle also proposed a
change that would allowdining dollars to roll
over from fall to spring semesters as long as
students stay within the same meal plan or
move up tiers from their current selection.

Hallinan said that while she could not give
speciﬁc numbers on the costs of the plans be-
cause ofconﬁdentiality, she could promise that
the new prices are more reasonable. "

While students might see dining changes
in the upcoming school year, they will not see
additional “reading days” included in the aca-
demic calendar. Reading days would provide

students additional class-free days leading up-

to midterms and ﬁnals.

Board member Zoe Samudzi said her meet-
ings with the academic calendar committee
did not end successfully. Samudzi said that
because of “built-in constrain ” in the cur-
rent calendar, additional reading days would
not be feasible. .

“If this change had been made years ago,
before spring breaks and fall breaks were built
in, additional days may have been possible. But
now, additional days would not be conducive
to the way that the academic calendar is cur-
rently constructed,” Samudzi said.

The Board addressed unﬁnished business
from the last public meeting and conducted a
vote that rejected an SGB voting referendum
that would allow students to vote for eight
Board members instead of ﬁve Board members
as it currently stands.

Board member Megan McGrath shared her
reasons for voting against the referendum,
citing the need for a diverse Boardand the
prevention of slate monopolizations.

“I understand that the point of the refer-
endum is to createaa Board that most satisﬁes
student needs and views as they see ﬁt,” Mc-
Grath said. “But I believe that if students were
allowed to vote for eight [Board members],
you would see a third—sister slate trend arise.”
Sister slates occur when two slates campaign
together. -

McGrath said she feels the current voting
system creates a Board that is more representa-
tive of the student body as a whole.

“I am for having the most democratic way,”
she said. “But if you are voting for Board mem-

bers who align with your views, ﬁve is still a
majority, so they are still representing your 8 A

_When citing studies, presidential A
candidates should focus on the facts

Rohith Palli
For The Pitt News

“My study is better thanyour

- study” can sometimes be the start

of a productive conversation.
But in this year’s presidential
election, that hasn’t been the case.
Perhaps the most emblematic
instance occurred during the
ﬁrst presidential debate, when
Gov. Mitt Romney responded to
President Barack Obama — who

'_had quoted a study in opposition

to Romney’s position — with
this argument: “Now, you cite a
study. There are six other stud-
ies that looked at the study you
describe and say it’s completely
wrong. I saw a study that came

out today that said you’re going to ‘

raise taxes by 3[,000 dollars] to
$4,000 on — on middle-income
families. There are all these stud
ies out there.” ‘

Well, that’s helpful.

This attitude is dangerous
and undermines the wealth of
information that academic and
intellectual — read: “think tank”

~ — studies provide to inform pub-
lic policy. If “there are all these
studies out there,”~ Romney’s job,

 

in conjunction with his staff, is
to dig through them to ﬁnd the
truth. Two contradicting studies
can’t both be right; the key is to
analyze assumptions and meth-
odologies involved in each study

and see which one, if either — or ‘

any — is directly applicable to the
situation.

The key,
insight here
is that not all
studies are
made equal.

In other words, disagreements
of this sort warrant a legitimate
discussion of validity rather than
simply throwing hands in the air
and quitting.

The key insight here is that not
all studies are made equal. One or
two studies cannot simply destroy
a consensus. Although they’re of-

 

ten conﬂated in popular litera-
ture, a peer-reviewed scientiﬁc
study is starkly different from a
study from the Cato Institute —
a conservative think tank —- or a
study from the Center for Ameri-
can Progress —— a liberal think
tank. The latter institutions have
an explicitly partisan bias in their
presentation of issues, whereas

academics are merely trying to,
' get‘a.t the truth.

There is also a key difference
between the nonpartisan, service-

Colleges should require internships to foster practical experience

Tiemoko Ballo
For The Pitt News

In an ideal world, every able person would
attend a four—year university solely to broad-
en perspectives and develop as an individual.
In the real world, a continually shrinking
portion of the population can actually af-
ford to receive an education, and a four-
yeardegree is quickly becoming the bare
minimum for desirable employment. Given
the often-crippling cost of student loans
and an increasingly competitivejob market,
shouldn’t universities do everything possible
to prepare students for a viable career? The
answer is yes. And the best way to do so is
by requiring students to intern at an outside
company before graduating.

There is no substitutexfor real-world ex-

perience. The classroom is just a theoretical

incubator. Though much of what you learn
in school will apply to your event_ual.career,
seeing your craft in practice at a business
is much different than reading a textbook.
Submitting an assignment is not the same
as meeting a project deadline. Doing a class-
room group presentation is not equivalent
to working with alteam to create a report
for an executive. The classroom can’t teach

- you the politics of a workplace environment,

the standards of corporate culture or the
practices of a rapidly adapting business,
Just the process of landing an internship
—— job hunting, submitting applications,
networking, interviewing -4 prepares the

student to “do it for real” when the time
comes to get that ﬁrst full—time position.
And having relevant experience and refer-
ences on your resumé greatly increases your
chances of getting hired, particularly if your

competition can only showcase coursework. J

Being an intern gives you the opportunity
to experiment, learn by trial and error and

narrow your professional interests through -

exposure to your intended ﬁeld. The intern
experience is invaluable. -

to nearly 70per_cent of their interns in 2008.

Though not all internships are paid, the
ones that are tend to pay relatively well.
NACE’s 2009 Experiential Education Survey
found that employers offered an average
hourly wage of $16 to $18 to interns working
toward a bachelor’s degree. Interning can be
a huge help to students who work during the
school year by offering good pay in addition
to relevant work. - , _ -

Doesn’t it make sense then, given the

What good is that expensive piece

ofpaper. if? you can’i.;show concrete

evidence of_.iisil worth ?  

That’s not to say that all internships are

created equal. Everyone has friends with
horror stories about alphabetizing paper-
work‘ for eight hours a day as part of an
“internship.” It’s true that some students
complete low-level or menial tasks as in-

e terns. But many companies treat students

like regular staff, challenging and providing
them with an opportunity to do work that

matters. And should that work be of notable ,

quality, then most companies will offer their
interns full-time positions. According to

the National Association of Colleges and .

Employers, employers extended job offers

beneﬁts of interning, to make the comple-
tion of an internship a prerequisite to gradu-
ation? Absolutely. If you can’t show that
you’ve applied your skills — that you can
actually use your degree —.— then maybe
you shouldn’t even have one. What good
is that expensive piece of paper if you can’t
show concrete evidence of its worth? Some
.people might complain that a requirement of
this kind would be too much of a burden to
place on students, that ﬁnding an internship
could prove difficult and delay graduation.
That argument is moot. If you can’t ﬁnd
a single internship, that might be a good

choice of major, improve your GPA or redo
your resumé. ’ ‘

Pushing students to intern is not a radi-
cal or new concept. Computer Science and

rolled out a new program that placed a high

' initiative, offered through the Univer_sity’s

Office of Career Development and Placement

that’s left to do is to establish a requirement

sides seem to be staking the election on
their economic plan, largely based on a
vision for the national budget. If they think
that voters are going to entrust them with
the presidency because of a budgetary vi-
sion, they are obliged to understand the nu-
ances of accounting and economic theory
that go into evaluating such ideas, along-
side explaining to the American people, in

detail, why their vision is correct.

This means that they should understand
in full what their budget and their oppo-

than throwing his hands in the air, I urge
Mr. Romney to respond by describing why

cause it indicates a lack awareness of these

the legendary musician’s decision to honor all
donations, no matter how big or small.

Women’s soccer ends "season on good note with victories

Staff Wrz'ter

Following a nine-game losing streak that
kept it from making the Big East tourna-
ment for the second straight season, the
Pitt women’s soccer team entered its final
two games talking about playing for pride.

And after defeating conference op-
ponents Connecticut and Providence by
2-1 and 2-0, respectively, it appears that
the team’s pride is a pretty powerful tool.

Head coach Greg Miller encouraged
the players to finish the season strongly.

“We didn’t have anything else to play
for other than pride,” Pitt head coach
Greg Miller said in a press release. “We
want to end the season on a good note.

play wants to be playing their best soc-

That doesn’t mean we can’t be playing our

Prior to this past weekend, the Pan-
thers (7-10-2, 2-6-2 Big East) had gone
through their ﬁnal season in the Big East
without a conference win." But they broke
through in a big way, ﬁnally igniting a
sputtering offense that had scored only
six goals in the past 12 games — going
1-9-2 over that span — after opening the
year 4-1 and averaging nearly two goals
a game. The 2012 team’s strong finish
allowed it to finish with the fourth-most
wins in program history.

Redshirt sophomore goalkeeper Nicole
D’Agostino made 12 saves on 13 shots over
both games, finishing the season with 87

“It obviously feels good to be recog-

that,” D’Agostino said. “My coaches said
it was a long time coming, but it felt bet-
ter to help the team end the season on a
high note.”

Pittsburgh’s AIDS Task Force will directly
receive some of the charity money raised at
the event. '

“We try and go to as many different cities as
possible and leave the money that we raise from
that night in that city,”John said. “If the people
inthe community are goingto turnout and give
us money to see us play tennis, it’s only right
that we leave some of that money in the city.”

John’s motivation to start the charity came
ﬁ'om a boy named Ryan White from Indiana
who died of AIDS in 1990.

“H_e knew he was going to die and had so
much dignity,”_]ohn said. “He just wanted to be
a regular kid, didn’t want to be a celebrity. My
life was completely and utterly out of control.
What that boy taught me was that if I decided

to get well, I would do good things. He’s been ’

my inspiration ever since.”
John still regrets not being involved when

Pitt didn’t waste time improving on
Thursday’s success, as Meier tallied the
eventual game—winner on a penalty kick
just 16 minutes into the contest. Junior
Katie Lippert was taken down in the box,
giving the Panthers the PK opportunity
that allowed Meier to drill a shot into the
bottom—left side of the net for her first
goal ofthe season. ‘

Pitt had many scoring chances in the
second halfbut managed only to convert
on one in the 55th minute. Charlebois
tallied her third goal of the week when
she headed in a corner kick from fresh-
man Roosa Arvas. It was'Arvas’ eighth
assist on the season,‘ second most in Pitt
history. Charlebois was named to the Big
East honor roll after her threeigoal week.

“Itfelt great to play that well to close

    

both of their games over the week—

out the year but bittersweet at the same
time,” D’Agostino said. “It stinks that we
waited until the season was over to really
start playing our best soccer.”

D’Agostino registered three saves for
the shutout and Pitt outshot the Friars
1'5—1o (6-3 on net).. -

With the season over, the Panthers now
wave goodbye to the Big East conference
and shift their attention to the off-season
and the preparation necessary to compete
in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

“The ACC is the toughest conference
in college soccer,” D’Agostino said. “They
have eight teams in the top 25, and we
will have to play top teams like UNC and
Virginia. But we have a strong group of
recruits and ﬁnished the season on a high
note, so hopefully that will carry over to

“The fans were great and obnoxious. I loved

Before the event, Agassi recalled playing in

get revenge on Agassi. Roddick defeated Agassi
in two of the three of their meetings, including

The participants joked around among ev-

any forms of payment, allowing for all of the
money raised to go to charity. "

“I’m so thankful that all the players are here
playing. A lot of people don’t do charity events
unless they get paid,” King said. “I really ap-
preciate it because that means there’s more
money that stays locally and that goes to Elton’s

. foundation.”

King spoke to the impact that AIDS has on
everybody, not just the homosexual commu-
nity. She called it an “everybody problem.”

‘‘It’s a very straight issue,” King said. “It’s an
everybody issue. I hope everybody realizes that.
