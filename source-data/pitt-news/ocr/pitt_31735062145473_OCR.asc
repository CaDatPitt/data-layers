Eddy Describes
European Heads

Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin Given

Limelight At Inquiry
—*—_ I

The most dangerous of men, a.
robber of liberty, and a shrewd poli-
tician, characterize respectively Hit-
ller, Mussolini and Stalin, Europe’s Big
Three, in the opinion of Sherwood
Eddy, speaker, author and world trav-
eler, in an address to the crowded
Inquiry forum at Heinz House VVed-
nesday.

“While Hitler, as the ﬁrst orator
in Germany, is the storm center of
the present European situation, he is
‘uniting the people far more effect.
ively than did Frederick the Great or
Bismarck,” stated Dr. Eddy. ,‘His
ability to unite Germany, however,
-does not detract from the fact that
he is the most dangerous man in the
world today and its greatest menace
to peace,

“Whatever good Mussolini might
have accomplished, he has robbed 42,-
000,000 people of their liberty. He is
half gbnius, half charlatan, ruthless,
cynical and immoral,” continued Dr.
Eddy. “Stalin stands as a contrast
to Mussolini, who is termed the states-
man of Europe, for Stalin is a shrewd
politician, rather than a statesman.”
According to Dr. Eddy, nothing would
happen in Russia if Stalin passed on.
Trotsky is a far more brilliant and
dangerous man.

Shifting to the general Russian
drama, Dr. Eddy made this statement
to over 100 students crowding the
room: “Communism can not be over-
come through false propaganda de-
scribing the starving of people right
in the center of the biggest bumper
wheat crop in Russian history.”

Council Overrules Junior

Prom Petition Rejection

Relations Group
Action Reversed

McParland Scores Pitt News For
‘ ‘ Misrepresentation’ ’

By Israel L. Goldberg
VVith only Ray McCune, E34, chair-
man of student relations Committee.
dissenting, Student council Wednes-
day evening overruled the action of
the relations group in refusing the
petition of the Junior Prom.
Student relations had voted, 3 to 2,
at its meeting in Heinz House Mon-
day, to refuse the Prom petition on
the following counts:

1. The petition was submitted
11 days before the affair, Com-
mittee regulations call for sub-
mission at least three weeks be-
fore the date scheduled,

2. Contracts were signed with
the orchestra and the William
Penn hotel, and tickets and post-
ers for the dance were printed,

before the petition was submit-
ted.
3. The -hours, from 9:30 until

2, were printed in the News be-
fore being approved by the com-
mittee. In like manner, the names
of the chaperong were printed
without permission. ,
Mc-Cune, in reporting to council the}

action which his committee had‘
taken, declared:
“The Junior Prom violated

every one of our regulations in

submitting the petition. I talked

with the chairman (H. Ellsworth

Miller, BA35) several days ago,

and asked him when he would

present his petition to us. -‘He re-
plied that there was no hurry, and
added, ‘What if we don’t?’ That
is what our committee wanted
to know: What if they don’t?’?

President Jack McParland, D34, re-
plied to McCune:

“I have talked with Mr. Miller
He told me that the committee
was compelled to choose both the
orchestra and the hotel during
the holidays. These are exten-
uating circumstances. I further
believe that the laws of student
relations committee should {be
ﬂexible enough to cover a multi-
tude of sins.”

Jules Green, :C35, was then given
the ﬂoor, and censured the committee.
He said.

“I believe, ﬁrst of all, that the
committee was not discreet in this
action. Secondly, I know for a
fact that the Sophomore Hop vio-
lated several committee rules in
presenting its petition; yet the
petition was accepted. Thirdly,
I notice that this is not the ﬁrst
time the committee has made an
issue of petty things.”

Pitt News Censured

At the beginning of the meeting,
President McFarland called the Pitt
News, and speciﬁcally its editor,

Speaker At Commemoration Exercises
Here Tomorrow Extols Stephen Foster

John Tasker Howard,
Noted Biographer,
Lauds Songs

By Marjorie Reich

The commemoration exercises of
the 108th anniversary of the death of
Stephen Collins Foster will take place
tomorrow, and it is to John Tasker
Howard, Foster’s most recent bio-
grapher, that the honor is tendered of
delivering the principal commemora-
tion address. Mr. Howard will ad-
dress students at the University this
morning on Mr, Foster,

Genial, vibrant, with a personality
reﬂecting the brilliant scholar that
he is, Mr. Howard revealed for the
ﬁrst time yesterday in an interview,
that he is contemplating writing a
biography of another Pittsburgh com-
poser, Ethelbert Nevin. He said: “It
seems to me to be the most logical
thing to do. I am very much inter-
ested in the subject of a Nevin
biography, and I have spoken to Mrs.
Nevin about it. I am considering the
work very seriously, but when I shall
begin it I do not know.”

Mr. Howard, as an author, is best
known through his “Our American
Music"; as an editor, through the
music division of the United States
George Washingtos bicentennial com-
mission; as a composer, for the music
for Percy Mackaye’s masque, “Wake-
ﬁeld,” produced in Washington with

_Margaret Anglin in the leading role

last year; as a contributor to general’
and musical magazines; and as a
presenter of radio musical programs.

Asked about Foster’s place in the
music of the world, Mr. Howard said:
“Stephen Collins Foster was the great-
est composer of people's songs, not
only of America, but that the world
has ever produced. In his own ﬁeld
of simple songs, Foster is without a
peer. I know of no other composer
from any nation who has written as
many songs of their kind that have
lived as have Foster’s. It is within
the last quarter of a century that mu-
sicians as well as laymen have come}
to realize that they are a genuine
folk expression; that Foster assimi-
lated the native inﬂuences with which
he was surrounded and gave them an
expression that was natural and un-
affected, unmanufactured and spon-
taneous. '

Mr, Howard believes that Mr. Fos-
ter’s most signiﬁcant song is “Old
Folks at Home,” which, together with
“Old Kentucky Home,” is typical of
the type of Foster song which deals
with the nostalgia and homesickness
of the composer. The second division
which Mr. Howard makes of Foster’s
songs is that of the carefree type_of
nonsensical music as depicted in “Oh
Susannah” and “De Camptown Races.”

Concerning the songs, Mr. Howard
said: “Stephen Collins Foster’s songs
reﬂect the character and the tem-
perament of the man who wrote them
——they are truly an art product. The
200 songs and compositions that Fos-
ter wrote—the best and the worst-—
form a biography of the man who

wrote them. The man who under-

Foster, the man_

“Stephen Foster, America's Trouba-
dour,” the biography of Stephen Col-
lins Foster, written by Mr. Howard,
was released Monday. Concerning his
work, the greatest living authority on
American music said: “I have en-
deavored to do two things in my
book. Whether I have succeeded or
not I do not know. First, I wanted to
write a human story of Stephen Fos-
ter and his music, and second, to
write a complete record of his life and
his works through contemporary
documents.”

In tribute to Foster Hall, where Mr.
Howard received much of the mate-
rial for his book, he said: “The
shrine is unique in that it is both a
repository of documents and factual
material about Foster, and yet also
preserves the living spirit of the man
himself.” "

So it was to the inceptor and
founder of Foster hall, Josiah Kirby
Lilly, that John Tasker Howard paid
homage‘ in his Foster biography by
dedicating it:

“To one who is truly

A dear friend and gentle heart,

Josiah Kirby Lilly,

Both Teams Will
Start Veterans

Carlson Ca-gers Seek First Victory
Over Rivals

 

By Charles A. Ruch

Riding on the crest of a victory
wave that has now reached 20
straight games, the Duquesne basket-
ball outﬁt invades the stadium tonight
to test its strength against the Pitt
Panthers in what promises to be the
outstanding attraction thus far in the
current district cage season.

While Pitt has yet to win a game
from the Duquesne men in the three
contests played between the city
rivals, and while the long list of wins
that the Davies passers have com-
piled in the past two seasons indi-
cates the power of the Dukes, never-
theless, Dr. Car1son’s men are conﬁ-
dent of turning the tables on their
opponents.

This will be the second appearance
of the Duquesne team on the stadium
ﬂoor this week. Tuesday night the
Bluffmen met the Westminster Titans
and came out ahead after a tough
struggle, winning by a 35-31 score.
The recent victory over the Titans
was earned only through Duquesne’s
superiority at the foul line, since both
teams scored an equal number of ﬁeld
goals.

The Panthers have been inactive
since last Saturday, when they tripped
the Temple Owls in an Eastern Inter-
collegiate conference game. The
week of rest is expected to have the
Pitt boys in excellent shape for the
Duquesne encounter, The whole
squad along with Coaches Carlson and
Kowallis, was on hand for the Titan-
Duke game Tuesday and had a good
chance to refresh their memories of
the Davies system of play.

A note of interest in tonight’s game
is that both lineups will be composed
of four men who played in the mem-
orable battles of last season. Don
Smith, Pitt forward and captain, is
the only Panther lost from last sea-
son’s starting ﬁve and “Bunk” Mc-
Geever, Duke center and captain, is
the only Bluffman who has concluded
his collegiate competition since last
year.

Coach Carlson is standing pat with
his same lineup that started the
Panther season. This means that
_Don McCamant and Skip Hughes will
be at the forwards, Claire Cribbs will
jump center, and Russ Ochsenhirt and
"Charley Hughes will be at the guard
positions,

Against this array Coach “Chick”
Davies is expected to send a. combina-
tion of Feldman and Birch at for-
wards, Brenner at center, and Moore
and Reiter at guards. Meyers,’ a cen-
ter, and Murphy, a forward, have seen
quite a bit of action in the ﬁve Du-
quesne games this season and are
likely to break into tonight’s game 111
the early stages,

The probable varsity lineup:

Pm; Duquesne
McCamnnt ______ __F ________ ..... Feldman
W. Hughes ...... __F —————————— —— Birch
Cribbs __________ -_C .......... -_ Bren_ner
Ochsenhirt ..... .._G —————————— —- Reiter

Enrolled To Date

Advanced Registration To Close
Wednesday, States Quick

Figures just released from the of-
ﬁce of John G. Quick, registrar, show
that a. total of 969 students had com-
pleted registration up until yesterday
morning. Although this is trailing
last year’s advance registration, Reg-
istrar Quick pointed out that each day
the number of students registering
increases.

The ‘manner in which students are
taking advantage of this advance reg-
istration is a clear indication of their
appreciation of the fact that the sys-
tem is for their beneﬁt and conveni-
ence, Mr. Quick -said.

Up until yesterday morning, the
ﬁrst seven days of registration, the
totals for the various schools were as
follows: College, 584; Business Ad-
ministration, 170; Engineering. 67;
Mines, 18; Education, 77; and Gradu-
ate School, 53, This total of 969 falls
below last year’s ﬁgure at the same
time, when 1140 students were regis-
tered. .

Register Quick stated that those
students who have not registered
should do so at the earliest possible
time. The ﬁnal day for advance reg-
istration is next Wednesday. This is
the last day the advisory service Will
be available until the regular setup
for registration in the Cathedral dur-
ing the mid-year between semesters
vacation. He also declared that stu-
dents registering late can’t be sure
of their sections,

large number of students have gone
through. ‘Thursday morning room 3,
State hall was ﬁlled to capacity with
students ﬁlling out their registration
cards, and even more are expected to
complete the procedure today,

the Pitt News office too late to make this edition,
are evidence of the fact that University students
are interested in reductions in trolley fare rates.
For the ﬁrst time in years student comment to the
campus publications has assumed respectable pro-
portions. Several suggestions oﬁered in the letters
may be practical enough to be considered seriously
by members of Student council who might do well
to ponder this question. If council is still wonder-
ing whether or not students are interested in trol-
ley fare reductions, let them read the letters on
this page.

A special student assembly to voice the opinions
of students on the question should be considered.
Coming from an interested student reader, this
suggestion is invaluable. It indicates that students
want something really tangible to work with.
Council hasn’t given them anything tangible.

O THINK THAT a special trolley fare reduc-

tion for students alone can be effected is fool-
hardy. There is no logical basis for thinking that
students should get special reductions while mill-
hands, stcnographers, store clerks, and others still
pay the same rates. But a decent—sized student
demonstration at Pitt will attract enough interest
from the people of Pittsburgh to get some deﬁnite
action started, at least. A student-appointed com-
mittee to appear before the mayor and City coun-
cil with the case of the student-body is another
possibility.

The ﬁght for trolley-fare reductions is, ﬁnally,
becoming a student ﬁght. VVhen Student council ’s
committee proved ineffective, students on the cam-
pus decided to take matters into their own hands.
It is now, really, a student ﬁght!

A voluntary student committee to call a special
assembly will get results. Campus organizations
might organize committees to concentrate on the
affair. The Pitt News continues its editorial stand.
Pitt students want trolley fare reductions and in-
tend to ﬁght for them. Let us have an assembly,
a demonstration, anything. Only show that we are
interested!

   

Today’s Conference

HE YM AND YWCA OPEN another in their long

series of conferences tonight when delegates gather
for a discussion of Communism, Fascism, Capitalism,
and Socialism. Whether anything really important
comes out of this conference, depends upon John P.
Bracken and Marguerite Swank, co-chairmen in charge
of the affair.

The reports which the committees will offer at the
la.st session of the conference will indicate whether stu-
dents have been thinking about the political situation
of the world, or whether this conference, like so many
others in American colleges and universities, is a sham
affair to give the school some semblance of “liberalism.”
Pitt conferences, on the whole, have been good ones.
Students have stood up on the conference ﬂoor and
have defended their opinions. The reports that have
been turned in were intelligent, student opinions on
important questions. -

ODAY’S CONFERENCE gives us an opportunity to

recognize the YM and YWCA organizations as the
really liberal groups on the campus. Most of the activ-
ity concerning discussion of pertinent world social, po-
litical, and economic affairs, has been sponsored by these
organizations. Taking no stand on any question as or-
ganizations, these groups maintain free speech on the
Pitt campus and sponsor intelligent and open contro-
versy on all questions.

We expect honest, sincere student opinions from the
conference. Reports colored by thoughts of faculty ad-
visers, Y secretaries, prominent speakers, or any others
will have little value. If students are going to have a
conference, they should express their own opinions.
That is all the campus cares about.

The Only Logical Course

HE REVERSAL BY Student council of student rela-

tions committee’s decision on the Junior Prom peti-
tion Wednesday night was the only logical step that
could have been taken. Student relations committee left
itself open for considerable criticism for its rejection of
Chairman Ellsworth Miller’s petition.

Scabbard and Blade recently had a similar occurrence
in turning in certain reports late. The affair was passed
by the committee and nothing more was heard of the
incident. Several other dances this year have turned
in late reports and have been passed. This information,
from the ofﬁce of Walter J. Rome, assistant dean of
men, indicates that the committee had either taken it-
self seriously all of a sudden or had something against
some member of the Junior Prom committee.

Council’s reversal of the com.Inittee’s decision should
call for drastic action regarding the future of student
relations committee. Student government at Pitt is in
a sorry state.

Dr. Eddy Comes Again
HE YMCA BROUGHT Dr. Eddy to the campus again

Wednesday. Dr. Eddy made a nice speech in Heinz
House. Liberal ladies and gentlemen applauded Dr.
Eddy’s remarks. A good time was had by all!

Freshmen have heard this speech by Dr. Eddy for
the ﬁrst time. They have three more years to be thrill-
ed. Sophomores have heard the same speech twice; ju-
niors, three times; and we old timers, four. It’s a good
speech, but it is getting a little time-worn.

Dr. Eddy told us everything we've been hearing in
political science and economics classrooms for four
years. He dressed it up nicely in his best oratorical
ﬁnery, and ended with a plea for a society to include
the Culture of Greece, the Order and Law of Rome,
the Moral and Spiritual Insight of the Jews, the Scien-
tiﬁc Movement, and Social Justice. He waxed oratoric-
ally dramatic at “Pagan Pittsburgh.” It was a nice
little speech while we munched our chicken-salad sand-
wich. ,_

Dr. Eddy prophesied war in Europe in two years. Dr.
Eddy does not believe a war between Japan and Rus-
sia in the East will be a world struggle. Dr. Eddy is
closing his eyes to the militant imperialistic policies of
Japan which have antagonized not only the United
States but Russia and Great Britain. Japan will start
off the next world war—but ah, we’re being dogmatic,
so much like Dr. Eddy!

I Opinions Of Student Readers

The Pitt News will publish all signed letters to the editor.
will be omitted at the request of the writer, but all letters must be signed.
The Pitt News editor reserves the right to omit any vituperative or irrelevant

remarks.

lifollght about by general reductions
throughout the city, then we are in
favor of that too. Student demon-
strations on this subject should be
urged by the Pitt News. as active tes-
timony to the fact that students are
anxious to get things done on this
question.

We students who have to commute
from outlying boroughs are even more
heavily hit than the rest. Most of us
have to “shell out” twenty car checks
a week. Approximately two dollars
every week! I go to school on Satur-
days downtown. That means two more
car checks, another quarter. Even
a 25 per cent reduction, as you sug-
gested, would mean two more lunches
a week for me. And two lunches, ﬁfty
cents for both, in these days is a
great deal.

Many of us are considering return-
ing to school for the second semester.
Of those who drop out next semester,
ﬁfty per cent will do so because
missing three or four luncheons a
week is too much ofaphysical strain
while going to college. A reduction
in street car rates would add a lunch
or two. Skimping on books and pen-
cils and paper MIGHT add one more.
Maybe some of us might come back
next semester.

The Pitt News should maintain, by
all means, its editorial stand on this
question. It is the livest topic of dis-
cussion on the campus today. It should
be kept alive. But more action than
our passive Student council has
shown will have to be demonstrated.
Why doesn’t the News call a, mass
meeting somewhere? If you've got
spunk enough to ﬁght this far, you
can go the rest of the way. Pitt and
Pittsburgh should get trolley fare re-
ductions. By all means keep ﬁghting
for them. Even though student coun-
cil prefers not to.

A DORMONT COMMUTER.

Editor, The Pitt News:

In your editorial “Trolley Rates-
Again and Again!” in the Friday is-
sue of The Pitt News, you continue
your stand for a reduction in student
trolley rates. We students like this
attitude of the News because news-
paper talk stirs up interest in a mat-
ter of such importance and results in
action.

When we try to get an organiza-
tion like the Pittsburgh Railways com-
pany to reduce fares, however, we
are trying to move a stone wall with-
out machinery. We can liken the re-
cent petition to machinery that is not
quite strong enough to move the
stubborn ofﬁcials that are after the
almighty god, money. The petition
circulated around the campus was not
signed by nearly as many students as
could have signed it. A lot of stu-
dents like myself did not even see
the petition.

There is only one hope and that
lies in the fact that Congressman
Ellenbogen is opposed to the high
rates charged by all public utility com-
panies. Mr, Ellenbogen is truly rep-
resentative of the people and no doubt
many of our students have seen some
of his literature sent to their homes,
urging them to give him their
economic and social problems. All we
can do is to wait and see what our
mayor does, then if he does not act
I will be willing to write a letter to
Congressman Ellenbogen in behalf of
the citizens of this city, urging him
to put his powerful machinery into
action. If all the students would write
personally or send a petition to the
Congressman, I feel sure something
would be done about it.

In concluding, I see no reason why
the whole city of Pittsburgh can not
have a ﬁve-cent fare or at least the
“four for a quarter” fare. There are
many working men and women who
would be greatly relieved by the new
fare price. 9

W. EDGAR GALBREATH, JR.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Apropos of your editorial in The Pitt
News of this date, concerning the re-
alization of the long-awaited and
much-discussed proposition of having
a student-written Cap and Gown pro-
duction, I have taken the liberty of
addressing to you this letter, in which
I will attempt to convey the attitude
of the Graduate club of that organ-
ization upon the matter-.

I feel that I am in perhaps a better
position to express this attitude than
many of the members older in service
than myself, in that while I am a
member of the Graduate Cap and
Gown Club, I am also stilla student
in the University, and can therefore
appreciate the point of view of both
graduate and undergraduate from per-
sonal contact with ‘each.

The Graduate club, as you know,
is a group of men, all veteran Cap
and Gowners, and nearly all business
or professional men, who have volun-
tarily given their time and efforts for
many years in order that an annual
show might be successfully produced.
They give their time willingly, be-
cause each of them have a real loyalty
to their old activity. They have ab-
solutely no ﬁnancial interest in the
show and would hever think of mon-
etary remuneration.

Some of my fellow students have
asked me at different times, “Why
does the Graduate club have any
active part in the production of the
undergraduate show?” This can be
answered without hesitation, The pro-
duction of a musical show requires
the effort of a. large staff. The budget
on which the show must work is pared
to a narrow margin, in oifder to
achieve the maximum effect with the
minimum outlay. To hire a staff of
experienced persons to handle all the
details which cannot be taken care of
by student managers would entail
such prohibitive cost as to make it
practically impossible to put on a

Signatures

The same attitude is

show on the scale of a Cap and Gown
production. This is where the Grad-
uate club does its bit. Some one must
ﬁrst of all see that there is a book or
a play suitable to produce. Some one
must see that it is such a play as
can be staged within the income of
the club. Some one must see that a
suitable director is employed, and
that costumes are available at a rea-
sonable rate. The music must be
chosen or provided by some one, or-.
chestrated and rehearsed. The Cap
and Gown Graduate club has done
this gratuitously. And in addition it
has in the past reached down into
its own pocket and provided a ban-
quet for all the members of the pro-
duction.

The undergraduate who complains
that the graduate members of the
club always write the show and the
music and do not want a. student-
written production are either com-
pletely misinformed or entirely unin-
formed of the facts. It has long been
the aim of the Graduate club to spon-
sor an entirely student show. But
year after year there has been little
or no response to repeated notices in
the Pitt Publications that student
shows he turned in at the activities
ofﬁce at a certain time. Those re-
sponsible for production of a com-
pletely rehearsed and staged show
cannot accept a mere scenario, out-
lining an idea for a show, and tell
the writer that he shall be the author.
This year, if I am not mistaken, was
the ﬁrst year that anything like a
completely ﬁnished book was turned
in. Unfortunately either the idea was
not of the type that Cap and Gown
could produce, or else costs of staging .
the proposed play would have been
prohibitive. It was for this reason
that a revue type of show was ﬁnally
decided upon. Such a plan will give
every person who has turned in worth
while scripts a chance to put his ef-
forts before the audience.

The members of the Graduate club
are glad that Pitt men have at last
reached out and taken their oppor-
tunity. They can sit back now and
know that at the last minute, after
having waited till time for rehearsals
to begin (and futilely) for a student-
written show, they will not have to
sit up- all night waiting for one or
two of the graduates of known ability
to dash into words a hastily con-
ceived idea.

Those interested in the fate and
fortune of the Cap and Gown club
productions should, if they believe
they have any ability along the line
of composing music, writing lyrics for
songs, or writing a clever, clean skit,
write it down and finish it, and turn
it in as soon as possible. If it is good,
or has possibilities but needs polish,
then it will be accepted right away
or changes will be suggested, as the
case may be. But students should
rest assured that a show by them is
a dream of the Graduate club as well
as of the student body, and it has at
last come true. By complete co-
operation between both groups, the
old Cap and Gown motto may best be
carried out: “Last Year’s Show VVas
Good, But This Year’s Show Must Be
Better.”

Very Sincerely,
JOHN M. ST. PETER, Law ’35,
Secretary, The Graduate Cap- and
Gown Club.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Whatever else Student council has
not done, its failure to grasp the real
signiﬁcance of the trolley fare ques-
tion is its outstanding failure this
year. To the inarticulate Pitt stu-
dent, Studnt council and the Campus
publications are the mouthpieces
through which student opinion should
be voiced. Council has failed to do
its part.

The Pitt News editorial, “Killing
the Trolley Question,” is one which
every Pitt student can understand. It
marks a milestone along the road to
real Pitt student government. I am
sure the student body will back the
News to the limit in its editorial
stand on this issue.

However, a more tangible expres-
sion of student opinion should be
given. An assembly, featuring Mayor
M..cNair or some other Pittsburgh
leader interested in fare reductions,
would give the student body a chance
to show that it stands squarely be-
hind the issue. The Pitt News should
suggest and advocate such an as-
sembly.

It is refreshing to see suddenly
awakened a student interest in campus
affairs. The appearance of the Campus
Index, along with the constant ed-
itorial hammering of the News, are
indications of this awakening. And
the longer Student Council remains
reactionary and politically self-cen-
tered, interested in petty politics and
dance chairmanships, the sooner will
be hastened its downfall. Trolley
fare reductions are demanded by Pitt
students! If Council doesn’t care to
act, the student body will. Now what,
Mr, Editor? W. C. K.

NE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT meetings of the YMCA polit-
ical conference beginning today should be the discussion of Cap-

italism, especially in its relation to the NRA. The NRA. has been,
since its inception, subject to terriﬁc ballyhoo, some criticism, and

a vast amount of confusing words.

Little clear understanding of

its real purposes and possibilities has been evidenced by any of those-
who have spoken of it, even by persons in high public position. The

meeting in the symposium may clar--4*

ify the situation concerning the NRA;
certainly it should illuminate it to
some extent.

There has been 9, misunderstand-
ing of the real nature of the NRA
ever since it was ﬁrst promoted, and
it is only recently that men are be-
ginning to realize exactly what the
NRA can do. It was ﬁrst conceived,
I believe, as a -substitute for the
Black and Connery hills which had
been up before the last Congress.
Both these bills provided for a scale
of maximum hours to be established
in industry, the limit of hours to be
30. The Black bill had already passed
the Senate, and the ‘Connery bill
seemed likely to pass the House.
These measures set up no administra-
tive machinery of any extent and thus
were not acceptable to President
Roosevelt. Furthermore, the Cham-
ber of Commerce and other powerful
business interests felt that the maxi-
mum hours had been set too low and
brought pressure to bear against the
bills.

Some substitute was necessary for
these measures, however, if the pro-
gressives in Congress were to be
willing to withdraw them. President
Roosevelt, in conjunction with his
advisers and the Chamber of Com-
merce, then brought forth an act call-
ed the National Industrial Recovery
Act, designed to give beneﬁts not only
to labor but also to business.

dent Roosevelt, was passed, and the
NRA became law.

The 3
act, under the forceful push of Presi-’

Because of the title of the act and
because of a failure of the President
and his aides to clearly comprehend

their own measure, the NRA came to,
be regarded as a recovery measure,.
one which was to bring prosperity
back to the coun-try. All the ballyhoo
back of it was of a nature to have
the country look upon it as such. 1
ESPITE THE ballyhoo, it is now!
clear that the NRA is not a re ;
covery measure. It should never;
have been called such. Rather, it is
what may be designated a reconsti uc-
tion act, a bill to consolidate and
make permanent any recovery that we
may obtain. The recovery program
of our country today lies in the pub-
lic works program, and it is idle to
expect the NRA to bring back pros-
perity.

There is little question that the
NRA, under General Johnson, has not
been the liberal force that was expect-
ed when it was ﬁrst put into effect.
The maximum hours are much too
long. According to Stuart Chase.
even if we do reach a 1926 level of
production, there will be 12,000,000
men out of work, with the 40-hour
week in effect. The minimum wage
is too low. Fifteen dollars a week is
not enough to enable any man to de-
cently support a family. Further-
more, it does not guarantee a mass
purchasing power large enough t0
absorb the greater part of the indus-
trial products.

But the most serious tendency of
the NRA thus far has been its swing
towards favoritism to big business,
and against labor. General Johnson
has outspokenly denied the right of
labor to strike, and the collective
bargaining provisions have not been
upheld. Trade associations have been
given almost complete power over in-
dustry, labor has been shoved aside
and the consumer has been totally
disregarded. The-se tendencies seem
likely to intensify, as long as men of
the type of General Johnson remain in
control. And such tendencies will
be instrumental in preventing the con-

solidation of any gains that we may
make. Nor will we, if some pick up-
should be seen, be capable of reme-
dying the defects of the NRA. VVe
can wrest control from big business,.
raise wages, and lower hours only
when times are bad. When times are
even fairly healthy, then no one is in-
terested in making necessary changes.

HILE THE NRA is not a recov-

ery instrument, the public
works program is. In this program
we ﬁnd» the government spending

money and spending it in such a way
that the majority of it reaches the
poor man who will use it. This is the
logical way to attempt to get recov-
ery. Of course, the amount now al-
lotted to the program is not sufficient.
It must be increased. But, neverthe-
less, the present public works pro-
gram is something in the nature of a
start.

The distinction between the possi-
bilities of the NRA and public Works
should be clear. The only logical
way to bring any resumption of busi-
ness is immediately to increase mass
purchasing power. Public works will
do that through the government‘.
money that is poured out. The NRA
will not immediately increase mass
purchasing, although it may, if its
hour and wage scales are changed,
make the increase permanent. As a
matter of fact, the effect of the NRA,
along with other inﬂationary meas-
ures, has been thus far to hamper a
possible recovery. That is, the result
of the codes was to ultimately raise
prices, even though it did decrease
unemployment and increase payrolls.
The rise in prices offset the rise in
payroll; and real wages, which is the
important thing, remained stationary.
From September to about the begin-
ning of November, there was a sharp
decline in business, which had im-
proved greatly previously, especially
in the two months before the NRA
went into action. This was because
of the failure of total real wages to
grow. Since early in November, de-
cline in business was checked, be-
cause of the distribution of funds by
the public works administration.

There are, of course, other incon-
sistencies in the administration pro-
gram, The fundamental purpose of
the “New Deal” is to increase real
purchasing power, The AAA program,
which calls for an increase in prices
of farm goods, contradicts the at-
tempt to raise wages in industrial
centers, since rise in prices of food
stuffs nulliﬁes the effect of payroll
rise. The inflationary tendency of
the ten billion dollar borrowing pro-
gram of the government will further
raise prices, again destroying the fa-
vorable effects of the wage increases-

The inconsistencies of the “New
Deal,” some of them unfavorable, will
hamper recovery. This is becoming
clear to all observers. It is also be-
coming ever more evident that the
only real manner in which to cause
more prosperous business is to in-
crease and increase greatly the spend-
ing program of the government. Only
in this way will any business recov-
ery be achieved.

But it is also becoming evident that
the NRA must be put into the hands
of different administrators, if we are
not to be delivered into the hands of
big business. Under the NRA, the
consumer must be protected and labor
must have its rights preserved. Fur-
thermore, control of administration
of the codes must be taken out of the
hands of industrialists and put into
the hanads of public spirited govern-
ment officials and labor. (Labor, busi-
ness, consumer, and government
should all have a voice in the man-
agement of the NRA. If they do not.
then we will ﬁnd ourselves living
more truly than ever in a land of a
business dictatorship, run by busi-
ness for business, and heedless of the
rights of the poor and the worker.

Miss Amos Talks
To Senior Women

 

-Program For Coming Semester
Also Presented To Group

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, spoke to the women of the
senior class at a tea last Wednesday
in Heinz House. Miss Amos’ subject
was, “Looking Toward Graduation.”
She said that the things one should
get out of college were: something
practical, the “why” of education, and
a sense of beauty. It is this last that
is the most important, and it is se-,
cured through a deeper appreciation?
of things, ideals, people, and self.

The history of the senior corona-
tion was also reviewed by Miss Amos. ‘
The present custom originated only;
after the plan of having a May;
queen had been tried and had failed.i
The senior breakfast, at which a pro-
gram was presented, has now become
the coronation breakfast. This year’s
coronation will take place on Tues-
day, June 5, the day before com-.
mencement.

A program for the coming semester I
was issued at the tea. An event has
been planned for each month until
June, and the social calendar includes:
a luncheon and senior dress fashion
show in February; a mother’s tea in
March, a buffet supper in April, a
faculty tea in May, the senior dinner
and class night in May; the Sunset
dinner, baccalaureate, coronation, and
coronation breakfast services in June.
The estimated budget required for
graduation was also included on the
program. This budget covers all the
social events, the dress, sheep skin,
cap and gown, Owl subscription, class
dues, and invitation. The total esti-
mated cost is $29.50.

The executive board for the senior
class this year is as follows: Presi-
dent, Jean Wilson; vice president,
Ruth Drum; treasurer, Vera Werlin-
ich; secretary, Mary Davis; social
chairman, Jennie Ritchie; publicity
chairman, Marjorie Bernatz.

“That editorial was not founded on

us has misrepresented the actions of

it would be better if the student body
was not represented at our meetings
by the Pitt News than to have our
actions misrepresented in the news-
paper.

Scott Turner then read the report
of his committee which is printed 9159.
where on this page.

Program Presented

McFarland outlined to Council the
results of the work of the executive
committee, which met Friday after-
noon to consider a new program for
the coming semester. He announced
that student representation on the
publications board of the University
would be looked upon favorably by
the Chancellor, who appoints the
board.

Council then adopted the following
point: Student representatives on
‘the board shall be two senior stu-
dents not members of Council who
shall be elected by and responsible
to Council. The President shall ap-

, point a nominating committee which

will chose the list of names from
which these two will be selected.

On the question of revision of the
Doint Scale system, the group decided
that the President shall aplloint a
member of Council who will be stu-
dent representative on the scale com-
mittee. This member will himself
appoint a committee to aid in the re-
vision of the present scale.

OWL SUBSCRIPTION BOOKS

Students having Owl subscrip-
tion books are requested to return
them immediately to the Owl of-
ﬁce, so that a. ﬁnal check-up can

ten Duke fans, and begin their chant:

Listen my children, and you shall hear

Of people strange and tongues to fear,

Of Duquesne fans who still will claim

Though they scored naught, they won the game,
And a barber, Sam, who's willing to bet,

But what and how, no one’s seen yet

And game time still nine weeks away.

is terriﬁc. Two white-collared. wheat-skirted Dukes enter, plank their kale
on the bar and sing . . Bells chime. New Year’s 1934.

You scored seven points in football
But we beat you just the same

You kicked, you passed, you ran the ball
But we beat you just the same.

They cast off their shoes and two blue and gold clad wenches scatter
thumb tacks on the floor. They face the rabid Pitt fans, the brothers S. and
sing . . .

We’re city champs, you must admit;
We beat you twice last year.

Around that champion’s crown we’ll ﬂit
Of you we have no fear.

You lost your star from last year’s team,
Your pavilion’s in decay;

We'll win quite easily it seems
On the Road to Mandalay.
When Caesar built the one hoss shay

Between midnight and morn,

Our gallant Dukes won many a fray.

And that’s why darkies were born. 3

Music In The Air As
Fraternity Women
Sing And Sing

Fraternity women on campus will

.be ready to pour out the best that

their throats have to offer next Mon-

day evening in Heinz House, if they

don’t get foggy voices from over-

joyed yelling at the new changes in.
the interfraternity sing. At a special

meeting of presidents’ council in
I-Ieinz House last Wednesday, the
time length for each fraternity song-
skit was extended from five to eight
minutes. The contest will begin at
7:30 o’clock instead of eight o’clock
as previously stated in the rules for
the contest. These changes were in-
stituted at the request of several of
the fraternities who stated that ﬁve
minutes would not permit them
enough time to present their entire
skits as they had planned to give
them.

A ten-inch silver loving-cup will be
awarded to the winning fraternity on
the basis of the spirit of the group,
presentation, musical quality, and or-
iginality of music and words in its
skit. *

Judges selected for the sing are
Mrs. Lotte Lohstoeter, assistant pro-
fessor of modern languages; Mrs.
Robert D. Ayars, director of the W0-
m.en’s glee club; Dr. John J. Geise, as-
sistant professor of history; Dr. Da-
vid B. Rogers, assistant professor of
sociology; and Mr. M. A. DeVitis, as-
sociate professor of modern lan-
guages.

Club Hears Mrs. Mitchell

Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, advi-
ser to the Nationality rooms in the
Cathedral, addressed the Ben Avon
Heights Community club at its mouth-
ly meeting Wednesday. Mrs. Mitch-
ell’g, talk dealt with the interior dec-
orations of the nationality rooms.

Command For Day;
Fraters Burn

And you, Mr. Grand Superior, chase
up to the diner and bring me back
two hamburgers with mustard. And
step to it!

What is this? Insubordination in
the ranks? Mutiny among the
Greeks? Colossal impertinence? Or
it is a hitherto meek enough and
humble little freshman, a pledge, mak-
ing this demand to the head of his
fraternity? And the hamburgers arei
brought back, with mustard, in prac-
tically no time at all! Unprecedent-
ed!

The occasion is the annual pledge-
frater day sponsored by Phi Epsilon
Pi fraternity, during which the neo-
phytes (Which any member of the
News staff will tell you means
pledges) become the big-shots of the.
ranch—for twenty—four glorious hours.
Promptly at 12:01 o’clock last Sun-
day morning, the boys who had been
taking all the directions and running
all the errands since the end of sil-
ence period this semester, took com-;
mand. The active members were sub-
jected to a rigorous program of run-
ning hither and back to you for nu-
merous errands, of maintaining com-
plete silence at meals, and of taking
care of all duties around the house.

Saul Cohen, C37, president of the,
pledge group, was the typical “king
for a day,” and in that capacity Mon-

Tomorrow night at 8:15 o’clock, in
the Stadium pavilion, Pitt boxing fans
will get their ﬁrst opportunity to see
the Panther boxers in collegiate com-
petition this Ybar. Coaches Dave Be-
loﬁ’ and Irv Kutcher will bring their
team to Pittsburgh to oppose Coach
Joe Orsini’s Panther boxing team,
in the ﬁrst conference match for
either team.

The team which meets Pitt tomor-
row night will be strong in all of

the weight divisions but two. Tem-
ple’s 175-pound boxer, Joe Pilconis,

has been kept out of practice by a

football injury, and their lightweight,}
Manny Finestein, has been sick for‘

the past two weeks. I

Coach Orsini is deﬁnitey set on his"

Very little chance of getting in shape
after his recent illness.

Jimmy Gianatti, who boxed at 135
pounds last year, will step up one
division to take over the 145-pound
assignment. Mike Catanzaro will box
Gianatti ll’! what may be the 111051;
scientiﬁc boxing bout of the evening.

The Pitt captain, Jack Schricker,
155 pounds, will box Edward Catan-
zaro, a left handed boxer, who has
had considerable experience.

In the 165-pound class, Joe Kopp,
member of last year’s varsity, will
meet another left hander in John
Konopka. Kopp has developed into a
clever boxer, but he does not rely too
heavily on his boxing skill, for he has
used slugging abiity to good advan-
tage.

The Temple coaches do not know
exactly what to do as yet for a 175-
pound boxer to oppose Verne Baxter,
P1tt’s entry in this class. If Pil-
conis ‘is not ready to box by tomor-
row night, Konopka, 165-pounder may
be moved up a class to represent Tem-
ple in the 175-pound division. In that
case, Tom Crossan would step in to
ﬁll the 175-pound division.

So far, no Temple man has been
named to box in the heavyweight
class. Coach Orsini has named Arnold
Greens as the Panther heavyweight.
Greene, for a big man is surprisingly
fast, and is always on the offensive.

The bouts will take place under the
intercollegiate rules. Cheering is not
permitted while the boxers are in ac-
tion. Bouts will be three rounds, each
of two-minute duration and a one-
minute duration and a one-minute rest
between rounds.
