Players Score Again
In Outstanding Play

Of Modern Writer

By BERNICE RIVLIN

.

It’s about time Pitt realized it had a polished drama

group under its very nose.
You no longer need go to

type of drama. Pitt Players can produce the same thing, and

proved that it could last night in?

completely new to Pitt audiences.

The entire cast could easily be
compared to a Tech group for
their apt portrayal of the super-
stitious Greeks. Ruth Schwartz as
the tragic Electra gave a particu-
larly real and emotional interpre-
tation to her part. Her voice, like
that of the rest of the cast, was
strong and carried throughout the
hall. —

Jack Ingrim as her brother Ores_tes appeared at home
inhis part, except for a few rather stiff motions. One of the
high tension points of the play was created by Ed Nestor, the
high priest, during his fanatical prayer to the dead.

It was not the acting alone,
however, that made this produc-

tion the greatest dramatic innova-
tion Pitt has seen. Experimental

The one noticeable ﬂaw in

the production was the rapidity

of the lines. Too often theileadsg“

tried to hurry over their speeches,

S which in some cases must have
been real tongue-twisters. Because
, of this, a good bit of the dialogues
were lost.

This also occurred during the
speeches of the ﬂies and towns-

so jumbled that they produced an

Sense-Les I

By LES GALLAGHER

In the last issue of this throw-
away sheet I read a very inter-
esting article. Some studentsmay
be heard to remark that there
never was an interesting article
in this paper, but that’s OK; we’ll
make allowances considering the
source. '

Trying to please everyone is
harder than petting a porcupine.
But, as I was saying, this inter-
esting article dealt with the new
Marriage Course. They call it Ori-
entation 102, .a nice non-de-
scriptive title. This course will be
offered during the Spring Semes-
ter and all those interested should
apply at the College Office, 1801
Cathedral. v

If your application is accepted
your slip will be sent to you’ in a
plain brown envelope so as not to
cause you any undue embarrass-
ment. So, fell free to apply; your
postman will never know and you
can tell your mother that you are
taking Orientation 102. But just
to let you know that youi‘ secret
is safe is not the aim of this col-
-umn. »

Instead, I am wondering if you
have to pass any type of entrance
exam to take this course. If you
do, you should read this informa-
tion which I laboriously gathered
without hardly asking anybody.
Test Samples ,

Suppose that one of the test
questions was, “What is the his-
tory of marriage?” Maybe you

. know. Maybe you don’t. But we’ll

run through it for the stupe sit-
ting next to you.

Begin: History of Marriage: It
all started in the year 25,000 B.C.
Anything before this is consid-
ered null and void by the various
Circuit Courts around the coun-
try. Of course I don’t like to
throw asparagus on the morals
of mortals before the aforemen-
tioned date -but we must stare
cold facts in the face- Neander-
thal man didn’t observe too many
of the niceities; it was .a catch as
catch can, love ’em and leave ’em,
hooray for Gunga Din proposition.

But from this dark abyss of
‘nefarious, nocturnal desire sprang
one_ hard, gem-like ray of salva-
tion. The night was the twenty
sixth of October in the year 24,-
312, approximately, that Farquar
Oop, distant relative of Alley. said
to his beloved, “I’d like to marry
you.”

This was the ﬁrst time this word
had ever been spoken and the
young lady in question just about
leaped out of her moleskins.
“What did you say?”, she breath-
ed. “I don't know,” he breathed
back. And breath wasn’t all it
should have been in those days.

“You asked me to marry you,"
she said. “Where did you learn
that word???

“Oh, I picked it up down at the
club. Thomas Manville Oop. was
tossing it around.” “Oh, Farquar,”
_ she remonstrated, “he's such a bad
boy, why don’t you play "wit
‘Artie Shaw Oop?” .
Tricky Questions

So much for history. On to the
next question. Who may get mar-
ried? The answer is boys and
girls, but watch it. It may be a
trick question. Any course which
deals with something as promis-
ing as this marriage course and

something to be suspicious of.

Next question: “What happens
when the union is blessed with is-
sue?” To the unsuspecting test-
taker this may immediately
sound like a few lines from Lin-
coln’s Gettysburg Address, _lC'Jt
be on your guard. These are times
that try men’s souls. Horray for
Gunga Din!

In reality the answer to the
third question is nothing more
than into the wedded bliss of
wedlock a child has been born.
Usually this is a multiple choice
question.

Another question is, “What do
you think of marriage?” I don’t
care what you write in here but
as for me, I look at it as some-
thing like the little kid in the
third grade when he was asked to
spell cat. “C-A-T,” he spelled.
“That’s good,” said the teacher.

“Good, hell,” he smiled, “it’s per-
fectl” ' V

 

Tuition Rises Force Students 
Away From Private Schools

lege of Liberal Arts of the University of Iowa, who took part in
formulating the report of President Truman’s Commission on‘
Higher Education, has revealed some of the behind-the-scenes
discussions that went on not included in the formal report.

the commission wished to make

One point not included was a warning some members of
to private institutions concern- I

ing the raising of tuition fees. Ac-
cording to Dean McGrath, “The
constant raising of tuition fees is
driving students into public insti-
tutions and is placing~private in-
stitutions in such a position that
in the event of a depression, for
example, private institutions will
have to turn to public support.”
He added, however, that the high-
est percentage of increase in tui-
tion fees inthe’ last 25 years has
been in public institutions.

The obstacles a young American
encounters which Dean McGrath
considers foremost are—(1) the
fact that a student’s educational
Opportunity depends largely on
the economic position of his fam-
ily; (2) ﬁnancial differences exist-
ing between states and regional
inequalities; (3) discrimination
against minority groups-—termed
by Dean McGrath “one of the
greatest stains on American edu-

lege curricula.

Commenting on the latter hin-
drance, he said that “our college
programs have been designed
principally for those of high. ab-
stract intelligence” and that many
young people are much more in
need of la diﬁerent type of edu-
cation. ' '

Two of the commissions most
important recommendations were
(1) to provide higher education
accessible to everyone through the
sophomore year of college by
eliminating fees and providing
federal grants-in’-aid; and .(2) .t'QT

establish in all states community ‘

colleges, providing a "two-year
general education ‘or quasi-pro-
fessional training.

Dean McGratlr_ believed ' the ﬁrst
recommendation should have ex-
tended to enable a student to com.-
plete sufficient studies for a bach-
elor’s degree, but the majority -felt

Marching Band DrumSec
Claims TitleAs America's Finest

When Capt. J. D. Hunter ﬁrst
took over the job of band drill
coach, he said, “It is my ambi-
tion to have sometime in the fu-
ture an all rudimental drum sec-
tion.” This year’s section fulﬁlls
his ambition.

The cymbals, scotch, and bass
drummers are the back—bone of
the rhythm of the band. They are
the ones who maintain the 200-
plus cadence that the students
hear as the band propels out of
the hole (Gate 3) on to the ﬁeld
prior to each football game.

The ‘tenor drummers’ work is
two-fold. Besides keeping the

color and ﬂash to the section. The

tenor drums work hand in hand

iEngineer Cobb Takes Vows
On ‘Bride And Groom‘ Show

By BILL SCRIVO
Richard F. Cobb, E 51, of Pittsburgh will remember his

And if his memory happens to get a little hazy, he’ll have
a recording to remind him of his marriage to Anne Elizabeth

For you see, Dick exchanged vows with Anne during the
airing of the national “Bride and Groom” show. '

The couples’ application was
chosen from among hundreds of
entries as “the most unusual and
appealing story.”

After correspondence from the
“Bride and Groom” oﬁices to iron
out details the prospective newly-
weds boarded a train (at their own
expense) for Los Angeles, the 10-
cale of the show.

The program took place in the
El 'Morocco Room of the Chap-
man Park Hotel with John Nelson
as master of ceremonies.

Miss Skiles appeared in a gown
of white satin with a lace veil.
The bridegroom wore a dark suit
with a maroon tie and handker-
chief.

M. C. Nelson drew from Dick
and Anne the story of their ro-
mance, to the delight of the lis-
tening audience.

It all started when Dick joined
a choir of which Anne was a
member. Nothing developed until
the evening of a concert the group
-was giving. Dick asked Anne~to
autograph his program.

This led to an exchange of
phone numbers and a dare to
Anne to call Dick.

Anne took the dare and a double
date was arranged. Dick went to
the wrong rendezvous, but all was
soon forgiven and more dates fol-
Iowed.

Oddly enough Dick ﬁrst real-
ized he loved Anne after she hit
him over the head with her um-
brella for standing her up.

After the story of the romance,
Nelson-distributed ﬂowers to the
bride and maid of honor. Stars
of the show walked down the
aisle and out the door to be mar-
ried at a Spanish chapel nearby.

The double-ring ceremony was
read by the Rev. W. S. McLean,
Dick’s former minister.

Twenty minutes later the new
Mr. and Mrs. returned to survey

their gifts which included a Servel
refrigerator, a dinette set, a set
of sterling silver, a wedding photo
album, a roaster, iron, pop-up
toaster, and a complete recording
of the show. '
Nelson then described the

honeymoon at the Casa Del Ray‘

Hotel in Santa Cruz planed for
Dick and Anne.

The newlys immediately board-
ed a limousine to take them to the
plane which would magic-carpet
them on their fabulous honey-
moon.

Coed Tutoring

Carol Nunes,‘chairman of the
scholastic honors committee of
WSGA announced that any wom-
an in need of tutoring in her ma-
jor. minor, or elective subjects
may secure help by signing with
the scholastic honors committee
on the twelfth floor next week.

Furthermore, all junior or sen-
ior women who can devote time to

are invited to add their names to
the list in_the women’s floor of-
ﬁce.

This is the ﬁrst time in Uni-
versity history that a tutoring

policy is due to the scholastic hon-

ors committee’s movement to en- V

large its services.

The aid which women of the

Caught Here  

A 26-year-old father was ar-

rested by police Wednesday on a
morals charge growing out of an
incident in the Cathedral involv-
ing two coeds.

He was not a student here.

Held Tuesday night by police
on a charge of open lewdness, the
man was ordered held over for

morning in morals court.

According to the dean of men’s
office, the man accosted two coed
Wednesday afternoon on the’

caught _him in Schenley Park.

Taken to the dean of men’s 01,-_‘

Now, in 1948, there are many aluminum
trains to ride. In the past three years
alone, 450 passenger cars have been
ordered. in Alcoa Aluminum. 103 freight

cars. 412 tank cars.

One reason for the railroads’ swing to

Alcoa ran the advertisement above before
being able to make big aluminum beams for
railroad cars——in fact, before the railroads
even showed much interest in aluminum.
Believing the idea was sound, Alcoa took a
chance, built costly machine y to make
beams, then went out and sold them. Result:
these days you do ride on aluminum trains.

This is Iypihal of the history of Alcoa. In 60
short years, Alcoa Aluminum has found its
way into thousands of useful things: uten-
sils that cook better, buildings that last
longer, planes that ﬂy faster. But this is only
the beginning. New developments, now in
the laboratory stage, are pointing the wan)’
to even wider uses for aluminum tomorrow.

Beat Weak OI

.1“; -_

The Educators successfully opened defense of their basketball

IM championship, outclassing a

game but weak Olympian ﬁve,

33-15, Monday on the Stadium ﬂoor. ‘
Paced by center Ralph Short, the winners took the lead late
in the ﬁrst quarter and were never headed. Short topped the game’s

scorers with 13 points.

Leo Skladany and Lindy Lauro also contributed to the short-

handed Educator cause, scoring
ten and eight points respectively.
Only ﬁve men were on hand for
the champs, with regulars Carl
DePasqua and George Radosevich
missing.

Specials Nip Raiders
With Amazing Rally

A Two last minute ﬁeld goals pro-
vided a dramatic ﬁnish to a Trees
gym IM basketball game Mon-
day night.

After trailing a fast Raider ﬁve
for 39 minutes, the slow-moving
but relentless Twenty-One Spec-
ials, with Phil Hydovitz and Har-
wood Dorman netting ﬁelders,
nipped them, 31-28- hoop ver-
;sion of “The Tortoise and the
31-Iare.” '

The Raiders steamrolled to a
20-4 lead midway in the second
quarter and looked like sure win--
ners. But with Hydovitz, game
high-scorer with ten points, lead-
ing the way, the Specials began
to creep up toward the stunning
triumph.

A well-balanced Monessen Pitt-
ster quint subdued the Band
dribblers, 34-26, in the opener oi
the triple-header at the gym.
Band’s John Verno led the scor-
ing parade with 11 points, but
didn’t outshine Monessen’s Christy
Runfola and Bill Opathiawicz.

IDK, a new squad in IM play,
so new, in fact, that nobody seems
to know what the initials stand
for, crushed the Dent Frosh Drill-
ers, 48-22, in evening’s ﬁnale
IDK’s Robert Goob and Mike

points apiece.

KOPELMAN

The time has apparently not arrived when the critics can
laugh in the face of Dr. H. C. (VVe’ll win ’em all) Carlson.
DOc’s Panther basketball team tomorrow meets a Bethany Col-
lege ﬁve that does not appear capable of ruining his team’s un-

Tomorrow night’s game, scheduled for 8:15 at the Sta-
dium, precedes a series of away contests that will keep the

'Pitts off their home court for al-
most a month.
Lost Only One

Although graduation cost Beth-
any only one regular from last
year’s_ squad, Coach Glen John-
son’s boys do not ﬁgure to be
tough. His holdcvers were able
to win only four games out of 20
last year.

And the basketball depression
still ﬂourishes at Bethany. This
season the Green and White has
been swamped by powerful West
Virginia, 71-42, and edged out by
California Teachers, 61-60.

The only hint of an upset to-
morrow night comes from the
obvious improvement in Beth-
any’s scoring punch. A substitute
center, John Vujnovic, burst into
the spotlight against California
by racking up 16 points.

Bisons Seek Center

For several years the Bisons
have been searching for a center
who,can hit the laces with regu-
larity. Because they like to build
teams around their pivot man
down Bethany way, the lack of a
scoring center has been painful.

Perry Bowden, a 6-4 giant from
Brentwood, was given a crack at
the job last year, but his shots
simply couldn’t ﬁnd their way to
the net often enough. ~

This season Jim Mewhirter, 6-1,
has been shifted from his old for-
ward. post to the center position.
Still, it was Vujnovic, only 5-11
and an ex-guard, who had to step
into the pivot post to do it justice.

Mewhirter at Center

The new look in the Bethany
lineup, however, is not conﬁned
to one position. When Mewhirter
moved from forward to center,
Don Harris, (5-11), slid into the
front court position. .

Stewart Mayer (5-10) has been
promoted to a regular job by rea-
son of the graduation of Bill Dum-
baugh, last season’_s captain. The
only regulars operating from the
same site as last year are guard
Karl Grizzell, ( 5-11), and forward
Ed Martin, 5-6).

Purdue Ranks With Irish, State

On Panther All-Opponent Eleven

By BOB VAN ATTA

Respect. for Notre Dame and
Penn State as evidenced by
the Panther gri(lde1's’ All-Op-
ponent selections was antici-
pated, but the recognition giv-
en Purdue and the lack of
same accorded Southern Meth-
odist came as a surprise.

The Nittany Lions and Purdue
Boilermakers each placed three
players on the selections made for
the Pitt News. Notre Dame notch-
ed a pair of berths while Ohio
State, Indiana, and S o u t h e r n
Methodist accounted for the re-
maining trio. ‘

Bill Fischer,
great guard and
t a c k 1 e f o r
Frank Leahy’s
Irish, was the
only u n a n i-
m 0 u s choice.
Fischer also
polled a large
m a j o r i t y of
votes as the

Jutst a n d i n g

Fischer

lineman the Panthers faced.
Fischer actually polled enough

support to win a position on the

A.l—Opponent lineup at both
tackle and guard. Since there
were two other guards and one
other tackle who ﬁgured promi-
nently, he was placed at tackle
on the ﬁnal listing.

Hurricane H a r r.y Szulborski,
Purdue’s 169-pound halfback star,
was named the outstanding back
among the many who displayed
their wares against Mike Milli-
gan’s men. Szulborski lacked only
one vote of being a unanimous
choice.

Leon Hart was named by three-
quarters of the Panthers to one
end post, and polled another vote
at tackle. Sam Tamburo, Penn
State’s All-American terminal,
ﬁnished well ahead of SMU’s
Raleigh Blakely for the second
position. '

Union Military Academy, Dick
never went in for swimming. The
Uniontown lad was a track man
then, participating in the low
hurdles and the high jump.

“Nothing sensational there,
though,” he admits. “I was just
on the track team.”

Petro, only an advanced sopho-

more, is eligible for two and a

half years of competition, which
should please Grady, who is h_op-
ing for his second consecutive un-
defeated season’. _

Dick credits -Grady with con-
tributing to his sudden success as
a college swimmer. ”He’s a great
coach,” Petr,o frankly asserts.

Swimming is no doubt Dick’s
main interest, for he participates
in National AAU events on the
