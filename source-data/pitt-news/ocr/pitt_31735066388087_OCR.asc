OLUME EIGHTY-FOUR, ISSUE TWENTY

  

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

What began as a night out at

9 an Oakland bar nearly ended in

tragedy for a 22-year-old female
college student.

After leaving central Oakland
at nearly 3 a.m. on the evening
of Wednesday, Sept. 13, and
walking down Atwood Street,-
the Point Park College junior

ad Dawson Street resident was
grabbed on her porch by an
gassailant who held a knife to her
throat and covered her mouth
with his hand. The following
incidents were an experience in
terror for the woman, an
education major who granted
this interview on the condition
of anonymity.

Her assailant was arrested the
following day by Pittsburgh
Police and identiﬁed as Paul R.
Jones, 23, a second—year Pitt law
student from Shavertown who
resided two blocks from the
woman. Police contend that it

was his second assault within
two hours and charged Jones
with two counts each of burglary,
terroristic threats and reckless
endangerment and single counts
of robbery, criminal mischief
and unlawful restraint.

“He was right behind me. He
put his hand over my mouth,
and he had a knife,” said the
woman. “He told the, ‘Don’t

scream, I just want your money.’ .

He told me to go up to my
apartment. I was outside my
apartment door, on the third
ﬂoor, and it was like ‘I’m not
letting you in my apartment.’
Whatever he was going to do,
he’ll do anyway. I’ll let him do it
in the hallway.

“So I was taking my time with
these keys, and he grabbed my
neck and said, ‘This isn’t your
apartment.’ He made me go
down a ﬂight of steps, and there’s
three guys who live on the
second ﬂoor, and I thought, ‘I
don’t care, I’ll let him think this
is my apartment.’ Thenl dropped

my keys —I had ﬁve keys on my
key chain — and I picked them
up. He was holding my neck the
whole time, and he had a knife.
I said, ‘Here, you try. I just
moved in here, and I’m not sure
which key it is. He was trying
and getting all frustrated because
none of the keys were working
in the door.

“He was making me go toward
the front door. He went to grab
my purse, and I grabbed it; I
don’t care about the value of my
purse;sI didn’t want him to have
my ID or know who I am, and
then I screamed really loud, and

V the boys who live on the second

ﬂoor came out, and I ran in their
apartment.”

The woman saidJones ran for
the front door and freedom, so
she assumed she had seen the
last of him for the evening. That
would not be the case.

“Our front door is really hard
to open, and he .couldn’t get
out. He ran back upstairs, kicked
their door in and said, ‘Let me

Assault victim recalls night of Dawson street attack

 

out, I just want out of here.’ And
then he went through the kids’
bedroom and jumped out the
window.

“He started going through the
kitchen window, but he put one
leg through and saw it was a big
drop.”

Jones ran through the
apartment to the bedroom and
jumped through two panes of
glass onto a roof, where he
dropped the knife that police
later found. Blood was also
found on the broken window
panes. He reportedly went to
West Penn Hospital for treatment
Thursday at 1 p.m. Police had
informed all hospitals to be on
the lookout for the injured man,
and he was arrested as he was
being treated for cuts on his arm
and hand.

“They [police] had five
Polaroid pictures, and I picked
him out. They got a search
warrant and went to his
apartment and found the clothes
I said he was wearing and bloody

rags. He had a steak knife, and

‘ they found another knife that

matched that one, but they had
his ﬁngerprints anyway,” the
woman said. ‘

The woman said she had seen
Jones in an Oakland bar before.
“I don’t think that’s why he
came after me like he knew
me.”

Both this woman and the other
assault victim, a 27-year-old
Dawson Street resident and Pitt
student, are scheduled to pick
their assailant out of a police
lineup on Oct. 24. A preliminary
hearing scheduled for Sept. 25
was cancelled when his attorney
asked the woman if she would
drop the charges and allowJones
to undergo psychiatric help, the
woman said.

When she asked police where
Jones would be until the
scheduled lineup, she said they
told her “that he’s not in school
now, and he’s back home with
his parents.”

Average SAT scores climb
for incoming Pitt freshmen

By John Jacobs
For The Pitt News

lfhough national averages for
OAT scores for high school
seniors have slightly declined,
the average score for Pitt’s
Oakland campus has continued
to climb.

For each year from 1985
through 1987, the national

average for composite SAT
scores was 906 out of a possible
1,600. However, the average for
1988 dropped to 904.

Meanwhile, the average score at

of Management Information and
Policy Analysis later this month,
and Director of Admissions Dr.
Betsy Porter expects to see Pitt’s

upward trend continue.

Porter said Pitt has become
more selective in choosing
freshmen classes. “We had a 23
percent increase in number of
applicants from 1987-88, but we
have a cap on the size of classes,
so we have become more
selective. " The greater selectivity
means that Pitt will experience

In 1985, heart disease killed
990,000 people. The American
Heart Association believes
100,000 of them could have been
saved with a technique that is
almost as simple as its name-
CPR.

Last week, Pitt offered a course
to teach the life—saving
procedure. The class consisted
of ‘students and adults under the
teaching of Jeff Heckman, CPR
instructor—trainer for the
American Heart Association.

“Response was excellent to
say the least,” said Heckman.

Eventually, he would like to
see everyone learn CPR.

“If millions and millions
continue to die of cardiac
disease,” said Heckman, “I’d feel
as if I failed as an instructor.”

There were two mandatory
meetings. The first one was a
lecture on symptoms of cardiac
alert, the Heimlich maneuver
and proper technique.

The second was for answering
questions, practice and the actual
test. Once someone passes the
test, he or she is certiﬁed for one
year

The reason for such a short
term validation is that people
tend to forget the technique
when out of practice. It takes at

least three to four years of .

certification before someone
becomes proficient.
There’ are “good samaritan”

_l laws in effect in Pennsylvania

that protect certiﬁed individuals

r‘ from lawsuits as long as they

follow the proper procedures. It
becomes a personal decision if
someone should perform CPR
after their certification has run
out.

Many professions, especially
health-related ones, require
knowing CPR. Kristin Clickett, a
nursing student, said that nurses
have to be certified.

There are other reasons as
well.

Laura Taylor, a Pitt student
taking the course, said, “I would

'I'HF.iPI'lT NEWS,

Pitt class oﬂers lzfe-saving techniques

love to help someone like that if
they needed it, instead of just
standing around." '

Another student, Sekou
Coleman, also took, the course
“just in case.” Coleman was at
one time a life saver but wants
to brush up.

The few moments it takes for
an ambulanceto reach a heart
attack victim can be deadly, but
CPR reduces some of the risk.
However, the situation is almost
never like the practice scenario
where the “victim” mannequin
lies ﬂat on his back with his shirt
opened, exposing the chest.

Heckman, who is also an
emergency medical technician
(EMT), recalled the time when

the victim was slumped around I

a toilet bowl in a bathroom the
size of a closet. He had to be
dragged out of the bathroom
before anything else could

1 possibly be done.

According to Heckman, CPR
can be a handy thing to know.
Sometimes, it’s the only thing
that lies between life and death.

lineup of stories. With the
large number of stories in a
broadcast and the exact time
constraints, he explains that it
is vital to accumulate a small

v amount of knowledge on a

broad range of topics in case it
becomes necessary toad-lib to
fill the time.

“The best thing for my job is

_ to know a little bit of just about

everything. Know a lot about a
few things, but a little bit of
almost everything,” Cannon

 says; “So. if you're‘ getting [the

signal] to stretch, stretch, stretch,

T‘ you can do it.”

Cannon’s history—oriented
background occasionally
comes to his aid when frll-time
is necessary. It is noteworthy,
however, that only after he
broke into radio broadcasting
did he decided to pursue a
college degree. ’

Growing up in Lawrence,

‘ Mass., he began working at

age 18, performing the duties
of “staff announcer” at a local
radio station. “You were
everything, and you did
everything,” he explained,
which included writing, disc
jockeying, signing the station
on, and in some instances,

sweeping the floors — all for a
dollar an hour.

After a few years, he realized
he was over his head and
needed higher education.
While pursuing his history
degree at Boston University,
Cannon found time to work for
a local radio outﬁt, enabling

, him to get a job broadcasting
out of Chicago. When his.
contract was not renewed for -

the radio job, he was hired for
a television news show.

It was in‘ June of 1969 that
Cannon found. his way to

Pittsburgh, and through time '

and work, he found" a friendly

V niche in front of thecameras of

Channel 4. ,

At 4:50 p.m., Cannon excuses
himself to get made up and
ready for the 5:300 p.m. show.
As'if his exit activates a signal,
the newsroom rises to fever

, pitch. Two staffers argue over

why copy will notgfeed from
the printer. A young woman
rushes past, murmuring
Obscenities repeatedly. The
lights go on in the booth, and
heads turn to the monitors to
see the product of their hours
of work.

The opening sequence runs,
and Cannon introduces himself,

and following a few
introductory lines about
Hurricane Hugo, the camera

cuts to Joe DeNardo, who

explains what the Pittsburgh
area can expect in terms of
Hugo fallout.

An hour passes.

When he returns to the
cubicle, Cannon’s attitude
seems to have changed. He
insists he isn’t down, but his
tone of voice confirms his

unhappiness with production V ,

flaws in the ‘C just—co_rnpleted
broadcast’.-.5 . ' .~

- “It's been a rough week. We
haven’t had a nice, clean show
in ‘a few days,” ‘he says, taking
a mouthful of ‘coffeerout of his
NBC mug. “Last night, a mike
didn’t work; today a page was
turned too quickly. We’re just
trying to assess the damage
and find out how to prevent it
from happening again.

“Some days, you get the bear,
other days the bear gets you,”
he sighs. “Today, the bear won.”

With a sheepish grin,’Don
Cannon brushes himself off,
finishes his coffee and begins

preparation for the 11 p.m.,

Borok urges the SGB to spend the reserve fund money

Tbe—Pz'tt News editorial of Sept.
26 raised some interesting issues.
You are right; the Student Gov-
ernment Board Reserve Fund has
become a reservoir for unspent
activity fee funds. As the newly
appointed allocations chairman, I
have expended much time and
effort to remedy the situation.

[Two weeks ago], I presented a _

proposal to theDirector of Stu-
dent Activities, outliningthe pol-
icy and procedures by which

reserve funds could be spent. The.
reason for my excitement about

this plan was hardly “rhetorical”-

for the first time since the estab-
lishment of the Reserve Fund,
elected Pitt students and not
administrators will administer the
fund. » ~

I was disturbed by some of the
misrepresentations made about
the allocations process in the
Sept. ‘26 editorial. As the ap-
pointed Chairman of SGB’s Allo-
cation Committee, I am respon-
sible for the supervision and
administration of student activity
funds. Because I am not an
elected official of the Student
Government Board, it is beyond

my constitutional jurisdiction to
propose expenditures from the
Reserve Fund. Clearly, this task
belongs to the eight elected

0 members of the SGB. Unfortu-

nately, until now they have been
restricted in their ability to initiate
transactions due to the lack of
policy and procedures. However,
pending approval of the Director
of Student Activities, SGB will
soon have the mechanismneeded

to initiate expenditures from the I

Reserve Fund. At that time, Iwill
join The Pitt News in ‘urging SGB
to investigate the best uses of
these funds.

A Stronger Case for Legaliza-
tion

This letter is in response to Dan
Brawdy’s column of Sept. '28,
“Legalization is not the answer.”

Dan Brawdy says that if drugs
were legal, their price would
“probably” decline. This is an
understatement. If drugs were
legal, their price would probably
be less than 5 percent of their
present cost.-

[...l Most burglaries are com-
mitted by people trying to sup-
port drug habits. One drug user
may commit several burglaries
every week. Legalizing drugs
would likely cut burglaries by 75
percent. Car thefts and muggings
would also be reduced.‘

When people take drugs, they
harm themselves. When drug laws
make drugs very expensive, there
are innocent victims of burglaries

and other types of theft. In addi- V

tion, the user does not know
what is in drugs purchased on

the street. People died from China ’

White because they did not know
how strong it was. If drugs were
legal, the package would say
what it was and how strong it
was.

Mr. Brawdy assumes that if
drugs were legal, the govern-
ment would have to be the one to
sell them. This is absurd. There
would be nothing wrong with
private businesses doing this.

According to my libertarian

principles, I own my body; not
George Bush, not Congress, but
me. Until this is recognized, the
drug problem will continue to
get worse.

The Last Letters Ever On Gun
Control ‘
This letter is in response to Mr.

Patrick McCray’s letter of Sept.
28. Mr. McCray: You ended your
letter with the ideological, well-
meaning call of “Let’s have a war
on war.” Well, Mr; McCray, con-
trary to what you might naively
think, stricter gun control laws
are not the key to crime reduc-
tion. Only when we have a crimi-
nal justice system intent on pro-

~ tecting the victim and punishing
- the criminal — instead of the other

way around — will you see a

~ reduction in the crime rate.

Most insulting to myself and

, many gun owners is your insinu-

ation that people who buy, guns
are dangerous and/or rednecks.
The average shooter, whether an
National Rifle Association mem-

ber or not, is not a psychotic or

redneck named Billy Joe Bob
who can barely score 700 on his
SATs and to quote Mr. McCray,
“cheers the censorship of artists
and authors." This shows aston-

ishing naivete. [...l I

A more accurate stereotype is
of the gun control advocate who
fears guns because he or she has
never fired one and having
watched too many poor cop
shows on TV, ignorantly thinks
all guns are bad and all shooters
are psychotically attracted to
death and destruction.

The Constitution is just as
applicable to our modern world
as it was to the time of our
forefathers, Mr. McCray. They had
violence in the streets just as we
do. Two hundred years ago, the
musket and Kentucky riﬂe were
the “assault riﬂes” of the day. It
was precisely these arms that the
writers of the Constitution wanted
in the hands of private citizens as
protection from the oppressive
central governments that do still

exist. Perhaps you read about the
nastiness in China a couple of
months ago? Or maybe you think
it could never happen in our
beloved, secure America. Naivete

strikes again. >**?

" John Haller

Yes, Pat, it is true, people kill
people. Thousands die each year
because’ they don’t pay attention
while driving. In spite of this
there is no congressional effort ti?
outlaw inattentive drivers. l...l.
Do you really think that most of
the estimated 500,000 owners of
“assault weapons” are any differ-
ent? They know that they could
go to jail for shooting someone or
at least that they will be sued into
the ground for aggravatedlassault
or attempted homicide. You say
that killing has become too easyy.
For whom? Given that there are
70 million handguns out there
don’t you suppose that it is a little
tougher than one would be lead
to believe?

I guess the main reason that so
many gun owners dislike waiting
periods is because manyof these
involve allowing authorities to
make the decision aboutwhether
or not someone should or should
not have a handgun. It just isn’t a
“cooling off’ period or a chance
to make a “background checﬁ?’
that is part and parcel of many
waiting period bills that have
been introduced into the legisla-
tive stew. No, it is really an at-

. tempt to allow local authorities to

decide whether or not there will
be handguns and “assault weap-
ons” in the hands of people honest
enough to come forward and be
law abiding. In my own home
county, our sheriff will not alloa
anyone to buy a machine gun, at
least legally. He refuses to sign
anyone’s forms. Why should I
encourage a law to come into
being that gives anyone the dis-
cretion to make the same deci-
sion about handguns? What if the
sheriff doesn’t like handguns?.f)..l

  joy to the world, the Catholics omdAnglz'coms um'te?

1.?’ Late last week, Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie, head
of the Anglican Church, began
his first official visit to the Vatican
to greet Pope John Paul II. The
object of his visit was todiscuss
the uniﬁcation of the Anglican
Church and the Roman Catholic
Church. Many people might see
this move as admirable and edi-

iilfying. The word I prefer is pre-

carious.
The two religions split in the
16th century when the Vatican

refused to annul one of Henry.
VIII’s many marriages. The divi— ,

sion started for the want of a
divorce and has progressed from
there. When I say that the unifi-
cation is precarious, I apply that

G to both sides.‘

In the 300 years plus that the

“schism has existed between the

Catholics and the Anglicans, the
Protestants have discarded nu-
merous traditions that are still
fundamental within the Roman

Catholic Church. For the Angli-

cans, the pope is no longer infal-
lible on church issues, priests no

administration felt satisﬁed with

the 1979 overthrow of the Nicara-

guan dictator Somoza, but didn’t
realize it would produce an even
more ominous Sandinista regime.
Ext what does time teach us
about our Vietnam involvement?

Many ’60s peace activists assert
that we learned a “lesson”, in
Vietnam: the U.S.

fairs. We’re constantly reminded
of this “lesson” in Hollywood’s
cinematic slanders of the Viet-
nam War. But what has been the
real lesson of Vietnam? How come

“imperialism" haven’t provided,

importantly, transubstantiation is

 

disregarded.

Obviously for unification to
occur, massive compromises must
take place. This would require
the Anglican Church to discard
some of its beliefs .and move to
the religious right. This would

also mean that the Roman Catho- ‘

lic Church must sacrifice some of
its history and uniqueness and
move to the left (“stepping into
the 20th century” as liberation
theologists would say). Either step
would compromise the authority
and validity of the two religions.

Archbishop Runcie sees uni-
fication with the Vatican as prob-

.,The Vietnam War

what has happened in that coun-
try since our pullout? Perhaps the
truth is too hard to swallow —— let

' alone admit.

The protesters cried that we
should let Vietnam take’ its own
course, without U.S. interference.

By 1975, all U.S. troops had left‘

Vietnam, and the protesters got
their wish. However, since that

time, the Vietnamese Commu-
nists have seized control and the ‘

results have been terrifying.
In 1975, quickly capitalizing on

the U.S. pullout, the Vietnamese _

government installed their own
puppet ruler in neighboring
Cambodia—— Pol Pot of the Khmer
Rouge. The Khmer Rouge then
promptly murdered 2 million
Cambodians. Hence, more people
were murdered in the first two
years of the Vietnamese “peace”
than all the years of the ‘US.
involvement. Another 350,000
were murdered when the Viet-
namese removed the Khmer
Rouge in 1978. Currently, the
Khmer Rouge is a strong threat to
overthrow the Cambodian gov-

able in the 21st century. Even
though that gives the two sects
110 years to reconcile differences,
they still have a long way to go.

If I was an Anglican, I'd be
damned angry if 10 or 20 years
from now, the archbishop of

Canterbury told me that my

church was being changed to
accommodate the Roman Catho-
lics. Even the smallest matters of
differences will bring about a
volatile clashing of ideologies.
For example, the Holy See doesn’t
recognize the consecration of
female priests, but the Anglicans
do. What would happen to the
women already consecrated if
the Anglicans stop recognizing
women priests? Would they have
to leave? Would there be a grand-
mother clause (so to speak) al-
lowing formerly consecrated
females to remain in the priest-
hood? Would they have to be-
come nuns? Bishop Barbara
Harris, “Get thee to a‘ nunnery!”
What if the Anglicans waived
the notion of letting priests many?
Would the marriages be annulled?

These points mentioned are just
a penny in the collection basket.
What about the more important
ones? ’
Unlike the Catholics, Angli-
cans do not see Pope John Paul
II? as being infallible concerning
church matters. In many Protes-
tant eyes, the pontiff is at best an
amiable, though misguided, holy
man. At worst, he is, in words of
Rev. Ian Paisley, “the anti—Christ.”
What would Anglicans and their
American offspring, the Episco-
palians, think if — overnight ——
they were ‘told that the bishop of

Rome now has the last word on»

their religious doctrine? _
Worse yet to Anglicans is the
theory of transubstantiation.

_Devout Catholics believe that

when they take the sacrament of
Communion, they are actually
eating and drinking the body and

blood of Christ. This is done by

the priest, through the interces-
sion of Christ, when he conse-

vcrates the bread and wine. Most

Protestants believe that the bread
and wine is only agsymbol of

Christ’s body and blood. Imagine

being told that from now on I

transubstantiation would be in-
corporated into your official

church dogma. Too many Catho- ~

lics disbelieve this practice, life-
long Anglicans will be hard-
pressed to do any better.

The other alternative is for
the Roman Catholic Church to
com promise. If history has taught
us anything, it’s that the Catholic
Church is hostile to change.
Besides, what would be the point
of the Vatican becoming more
liberal when there are already
scores of “enlightened” religions
pandering to the religious left? If

you don’t believe in the Catholic .

dogma, then don ’t go to a Catho-
lic Church,_ but let the church be

ernment and return to power.
How has Vietnamese commu-

 

nism performed economically?
Their inﬂation rate of last year
stood at 700 percent; the govern-
ment has defaulted almost all of
its foreign debt of $3 billion; their
foreign exchange reserves have
dropped to a mere $20 million;
they can’t produce enough rice
to feed their own people and
asked for foreign assistance in
1988 for the 4 million that were
“near starvation." All this despite
$2 billion of Soviet economic aid
each year.

In fact, the Vietnamese people
have been so pleased with their
government that an estimated 1
million have ﬂed South Vietnam
since 1975; 361 thousand left the
country for the United States
between ’71 and ’80; and«188.5
thousand have fled to the United
States from ’82 to ’87. Currently,
there are approximately 56,000
Vietnamese living in boats along
the shores of Hong Kong; 9,200
of these refugees left in May
alone. H

’ The ’60s protesters told us that
the Soviet Union backed North
Vietnam only because we were a
threat to the Soviets. But once the
U.S. Congress cut aid by 75 per-
cent to Saigon in response to the
1973 Paris Peace accords, the
Soviet Union increased its aid to
Hanoi. Today the Soviet threat is
firmly established in the form of
Soviet naval bases at Cam Rahn

Bay and Danang where they can L

threaten Japan’s oil lifeline to the
Persian Gulf. Also, Soviet military
aid has helped give Vietnam the
fourth largest army in the world

(despite economic crises in both
countries). _ .
If we did anything wrong in

Vietnam, it was how we went 3

about doing. it. Ultimately, our
goal wasn’t a hegemonic or
imperialist one, but a good one;
we didn’t want a Communist and

Soviet inﬂuence in Southeast Asia '-

politically disastrous Laos and

Cambodiacare also Communist. , A

Time has proven that our goals in
Vietnam were noble ones through
the catastrophes that have oc-
curred in Southeast Asia in the
past 15 years — which we aimed
to prevent. I

We did learn a ‘-‘lesson” in
Vietnam: our government’s pre-
dictions about the evils that would

follow a U.S. pullout were cor-

rect and the protesters were
wrong. Perhaps they were just as
wrong back then as they are with
Central America today. Butwhy
aren’t they saying it?

Allow me to tell the tale of my
arrival here in Pittsburgh only a
few short weeks ago. I had just
come from the interstate and
pulled onto Fifth Avenue looking
for a place to unload, when
suddenly, I was cut off — not by
a ﬂaming red sportscar or even
by a ﬂaming red bicycle. I was cut
off by a horde of matriculating
Pittsburghites. Had I not replaced
my brake pads the day before,
Fifth Avenue would have had yet
another resurfacing.

Little did I suspect that this was
not an isolated incident. Rather, it
was an example of what is obvi-
ously the acoepted means of trans-

portation in this city.

How odd! When I consider the
myriad of dangers that await the
unwary pedestrians —— not the
least of which are the maniacal
Bus Driversﬁom Hell — I cannot
think. of a single good reason
why anyone would take his life
into his hands this way. Sure,
pedestrians have the right of way.
But some of these people are
getting a little carried away. And
if they’re not careful, they’ll soon
be literally carried away.

Maybe it’s an ego thing —- the
old “it’ll never happen to me”
theory, but in a different context.
I had a cat (Fells ﬂatus) that

apparently held this opinion —
the operative word being “had.”
(Anybody ever see Pet Sema-

tary?)

Cats, of course, do not have
egos. Neither do lemmings. But
people do. They can ponder the
consequences of their actions.
Thus, I am left wondering just
who the “dumb animals” really
are.

Perhaps lam getting all worked
up over nothing. After all, I once
knew a guy who made a living
stepping in front’ of traffic and
then suing the drivers for any
“emotional damages” that might

ensue. Hist bathroom was bigger‘

than my house!

Panthers content with WVU comeback tie...

...but stalemate
not uncommon
in Pitt history

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

MORGANT OWN, W.Va. — While the
means of Pitt’s comeback against the West
Virginia Mountaineers was not typical or
predicted, the end result, a 31-31 tie, was
not surprising in the face of Pitt history.

It was the 41st tie in Pitt history, the third
against West Virginia and the second in
head coach Mike Gottfried’s four-year
tenure in Pittsburgh. Kansas also recorded
a tie in'1983 while Gottfried was the head
coach there. ‘

“A tie’s a tie; it’s not a win," said Pitt
center/guard Dean Caliguire, a fifth-year
player who has been involved in three
collegiate ties — one underforrner head
coach Foge Fazio and two under Gottfried.

But this tie left Caliguire in a good
mood. “The good thing about this tie was
we came back and we held together, and
nobody gave up on this team. That's the

nice thing about it, and later on down the‘

line, that’s going to pay off for us. A tie’s
not a win, but it’s also not a loss. We're all
alive for everything we have, for the goals
we have set in front of us, to win the east
and contend for a national championship.
I think that’s all still very well alive.”
Gottfried’s second stalemate leaves him
tied with former coaches Joseph Thompson
and Fred Robinson for fifth on the all-time
Pitt list. Jock Sutherland, who coached
from 1924-1938, leads all coaches with 12
ties. John Michelson (1955-65) is second
with seven; Glenn “Pop” Warner (1915-
23) third with four; and Fazio (1982-85) is

of football fans

Everybody likes to second—guess the
coach’s calls. If a risky play works, the
coach is a genius, if the play ﬂops, the
coach has thousands of people screaming
their displeasures at him. Pitt head coach

'Mike Gottfried had many tough and

controversial calls to make in the West
Virginia tie. Here's a brief analysis of some

 

V of those calls:
1. The main decision. Go for the tie in t

final seconds, or go for the win? Gottfried
went for the tie, although he saidif he was
at home, he would have gone for the win.

Why even consider going for the win at
all? At this point in the season, Pitt has
nothing to lose by tying West Virginia,
who was ranked higher and was favored
before the game. A tie leaves Pitt very
much alive for the Lambert trophy (given
to the best eastern independent team) and
even the national championship. _

If they would have gone for the

touchdown and missed, the loss would
have severely hurt these chances, especially
considering the weak remaining WVU
scheduleﬁlf they would have gotten the
touchdown and won, sure it would have
been nice, but it wouldn't really mean that
much more to them as far as rankings are
concerned. Good decision on Gottfried’s
part.

game, Gottfried sentjeff Van Horne out to

Lookfor Rea’ Wingsto repeat in Norris Division

The National Hockey League
begins its season on Thursday.
The league’s feature attraction
this season is the addition of
seven players from the Soviet
Elite League. These players will
get their first chance to show
their talents to North America this
season.

Today, we begin our preview
of the 1989-90 season with a look
at the league’s best division
(Smythe) and the league’s worst
(Norris).

NORRIS DIVISION

The Detroit Red Wings are the
defending regular-season Norris
Division champions, but they
were quickly eliminated by the
Chicago Blackhawks in the first
round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs,
and now many people are
wondering if the talent is there
for the Red Wings to win the
division again. A young St. Louis
Blues team is the squad most
likely to challenge Detroit. They

added youth at every position,
Iwhich, along with their

improvement at the end of last
season, makes the Blues a team
to watch in the weak Norris

Division. The Minnesota North
Stars are making strides in the
right direction. For the first time
in three years, the Stars enter the
season with the same coach and
general manager they had at the
end of last season. The
Blackhawks, coming off their
surprising playoff performance
in which they made it to the

 

Campbell Conference Finals,
need to add depth to do what
they did in the playoffs over the
whole season; so watch for a
letdown in the \Vindy City. Finally,
the Toronto Maple Leafs will need
a major miracle to even make the
playoffs, but since we are talking
about the Norris, who knows?
Toronto could ﬁnish ﬁrst.

The main reason the Detroit
Red Wings will repeat as Norris
Division champions is Steve
Yzerman. Yzerman, with his
outstanding performance last

year, has made the elite duo of
Lemieux and Gretzky into the
elite trio. He is capable of carrying
the Wings, and it looks as if they
will need to be carried at times
this season. The goaltending
tandem of Greg Stefan and Glen
Hanlon is competent, but they
have been unable to push the
team over the top in the playoffs.
Detroit added some experience
with the additions of 38-year-old
Borje Salming atdefense and 32-
year-old Bernie Federko at center.
The moves were mostly made to
add character to a team that was
ripped apart last year with the
problems involving Bob Probert
and Petr Klima.

The St. Louis Blues made a
move toward youth in the off-
season by trading to the Red
Wings Federko and Tony
McKegney for Adam Oates and
Paul MacLean. Another move
toward youth took place in goal,
where 1 1-year NHL veteran Greg
Millen’s starting status was placed
in jeopardy when the team signed
rookie free agent Curtis Joseph
from the University of Wisconsin
to a $1.1 million contract. The

overall team offense is solid with
the play of Peter Zezel and Brett
Hull. The defensemen themselves
are weak, but under coach Brian
Sutter the Blues have become
one of the strongest forechecking
units in -the league, which takes
some pressure off the
defensemen. With a solid backup
goalie in Vincent Riendeau, the

 

Blues could afford to trade Millen
for a solid defenseman. That
would sure up their most glaring
weakness and push them to the
top of the division.

The -Minnesota North Stars
are in search of a goal scorer and
an offensive defenseman. They
attempted to end the search with

the late season additions of Mike '

Gartner and Larry Murphy from
the Washington Capitals for Dino
Ciccarelli. That trade capped off
a 19-point improvement for the
Stars last season. Now the Stars

are looking for a little more
offensive punch to keep moving
forward in their quest of regaining
respect in the NHL. The solid
goaltending of Kari Takko and
Jon Casey and the improved play
on defense with Murphy and
former Penguin Ville Siren took
the North Stars from the worst
defense in hockey to the best in

Women finding it easier to break into sports journalism

By Mike Rampa
Ass’t Sports Editor

It has been 10 years since
women have become involved
in sports journalism. Ten years of
dealing with ridiculing, crotch-
grabbing athletes in locker rooms,
ten years of sitting in mostly all-
male press boxes and ten years of
attempting to gain respectability
in a field traditionally dominated
by men.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette senior
copy editor Sharon Eberson is
one of the lucky women who
have had the “privilege” of
breaking the barriers and making
sports journalism her career.

In her editorial position,
Eberson is currently responsible
for deciding which stories are to
appear on the front of the sports
‘page, in addition to editing articles
turned in by the Post-Gazette
sportswriters. She has become an
integral part of the top of the
sports Eberson’s route to success
was surprisingly easy. “I was very
lucky. All through my career, I

never had to make a call to get a
job. That never happens, I’m very
unusual.”

A native of New York and an
avid hockey fan, Eberson’s first
break into sports journalism cam
after her graduation from
Brooklyn College. Friend and
Mentor Stan Fisher made her the
assistant managing editor of his
periodical side project, Action
Sports Hockey. All of a sudden,
Eberson was thrust into the elite
company of prominent New York
sportswriters as she began to
cover the New York Rangers and
New York Islanders with
regularity.

As Eberson recalls, hockey was
a sport which was pioneered for

her by New Yorle Times writer ’

Robin Herman. Herman served
as a “test case” for women in
sports. After an NHL All—Star game,
she was the first woman allowed
into a professional hockey locker
room. .

“I was very lucky. Other women
had done it for me [broken the
gender barrier] so that hockey

was very open. It was no big deal
going into a locker room,
especially in New York, ” Eberson
said.

Somewhat surprisingly,
Eberson’s real test of being a
woman in a man’s locker came
when she covered the now-
defunct indoor soccer franchise,
the Pittsburgh Spirit.

“The Spirit was where you really
got tested as a woman in a locker
room situation. Not many people
covered them so when you
walked into the locker room,
they’d do all kinds of things to try
and rattle you  throwing jocks
at you and playing with
themselves when you were trying
to talk to them,’ Eberson said.

Eberson came to Pittsburgh in
February of 1980 after being
referred by a colleague who was
getting offers from newspapers
that were speciﬁcally looking for
women. She was hired on the
spot by the Post-Gazette which
was short—handed on personnel
at the time, and was one of the
papers recruiting women to fill
the space.

Eberson realized that talent
alone did not get her the job.
Perhaps. the old adage, “it’s not
what you know, but who you
know,” should be changed to “

it's not what you know, but, what
you are,” to fit Eberson’s job
offerings. She stated that it helped
to be a woman in landing her
jobs. ’

When Eberson was in her stages
as a sportswriter, many women
were interested in the field. She
cites a marked decrease in the
number of interested women in
today’s job market. Eberson finds
this fact surprising as well as
distressing, most of the gender
barriers have been broken.
Eberson does not knowiwhy this
disinterest is so prevalent.

But Eberson answered her own
questions as she explained that
the future is moving more toward
television and broadcast
journalism; thereby dictating a
general decrease in interest
among men and women in the
print media. “There are so many
towns in the U.S. that are
becoming one—news papers towns
that it is frightening,” she said.

Also, interviewing rights to
athletes are being granted to
television first, and print media
second. “Reporters are trying to
talk to star athletes ‘and they’re
being denied because television
claims them for post game shows.
There is no way an athlete has
time to do a TV spot and then

come down and talk to reporters.
And in that way, the print media
is being denied,” said Eberson.

Considering the job market for
women in sports journalism is
fairly easy to crack, according to
Eberson, the one major problem
she says all women will face is
the age old controversy of women
in male locker rooms.

‘A lot of interviewing situations
are gross. It’s a hot room with
showers and you’ve got these
sweaty guys who stink and you’re
in a hurry to meet a deadline.
Some guys are gentlemen and
know that there will be women
in the locker room, so they wait
five minutes to take off their
pants. Others will harass you just
because you’re a woman and
that affects your quotes and story
in general,” Eberson said.

As an editor, Eberson is satisfied
with her position because she
states that not many women are
presently doing what she is and
the feeling of knowing that she is
in demand is reassuring. ‘

Eberson is quick to encourage

women with a serious interest in '

sports journalism to follow their
goals, because the road to success
may not be as hard as they think,

I as this female sports editor can

surely attest to.

Coach

Continued from page 9
the score. He called the kicking
team back in and sent out his
Offense for one more play.

This was a Very risky call, but
one he had to make. The Offense
could do no wrong in the fourth
quarter, and Van Horne hasn’t
attempted a field goal in Over a
year. The offense needed about
10 yards to get into Frazier’s range,
who hit a 42-yard field goal in the
first half already. But with less
than seven seconds to work with,
the offense had to hurry and be
Sure to get out of bounds to stop
the clock. They did, and Frazier
hit his second 42-yarder.

A 3. The last drive was set up by
a WVU punt from the Mountaineer
12-yard line. Alonzo Hampton,
Pitt’s return specialist, was back
to receive. As soon as West
Virginia punter Greg Herzog
kicked it, Hampton’s arm went
up to call for the fair catch.

Hampton had at least 10 to 15
yards of open field in front of
him; why fair catch? The clock
would have stopped as soon as
the run back was Over. All the fair
catch did was save a few seconds.

Hampton is considered by
many to be one of the best punt
returners in the nation; let him
run it. With the 10 to 15-yard
head start and Hampton’s
breakaway capability, who knows

.what could have happened?

4. Hampton was involved in
another questionable game—p1an
call. With 21 seconds remaining
in the first half, West Virginia had

‘ 58 yards to go for a touchdown.

It doesn’t sound good for a score
before the _half. But never sell
Major Harris short; you can never

tell what the Heisman Trophy '

candidate can do.

Harris launched a pass to Reggie
Rembert, WVU’s All-American
candidate wide receiver, who beat
Hampton’s man—to-man coverage
and caught the ball at the 4-yard.
line.

There’s no reason that with 21
seconds left and ‘ Harris at

quarterback, there should be man-

to-man coverage on a receiver as
dangerous as Rembert. Even

though Hampton is an All-

American candidate himself at
cornerback, he should have had
at least one other safety deep
with him.

5. Another questionable
decision at the end of the first half
was when Pitt went for more
points instead of running out the
clock with 1:23 remaining. It didn’t
work, and Pitt paid for it, but it
was a good decision.

At the time, Pitt was down 14-
9 and were deep in their own
territory. Deep in your own end
of the field, you want to run
down the clock, but Redmon
took the first handoff out to the
Panther 50- yard line. Why not try
to get some more points now that
things are moving? The rest of the
drive didn’t work. Van Pelt made
a mistake by throwing the ball
out of bounds on third and eight
instead of waiting for a receiver
to break open or run around and

have killed any hopes the
Panthers had of coming back. Pitt
started the drive on their own 40
with 49 seconds left and no time
outs remaining.

The first offensive play is a
Ronald Redmon off-tackle run.
Not only did it gain just two yards
and waste a down, it kept the
clock going and ate about 15 to
20 seconds.’ A fourth-down
completion from Van Pelt to Tuten
was the savior of the drive.

Apparently, the running call
was to try to catch the West
Virginia defense off guard. With
no time outs left, a running call
that doesn’t head toward the
sidelines is a very suspect call. If
Pitt has to run, at least give the
ball to Curvin Richards who has
more breakaway capability.

7. Speaking of Richards, why is
he returning kicks? He only got
the chance to return one, and
he’s probably just a decoy so
opposing teams kick away from
him, but why even risk having

 

your main offensive weapon on
the kick return team?

Kickoffs are brutal; it's 11 guys
running full speed with disregard
for their bodies just itching to hit
someone as hard as they can.
Pitt’s other kick returner, Steve
Israel, is out for the season with
a knee injury from a kick return
in the third quarter of the WVU
game. Why risk having Curvin
back there?

8. Another kickoff-related
decision. Pitt won the toss in the
beginning of the game. They
deferred and ‘decided to kick
instead of return’. This doesn’t
happen often, but in this case it
was a great decision.

The 69,000 Hoopies in
attendance were still buzzing from
their’ tailgating and were all fired
up at the beginning of the game.
Definitely put the highly ranked
defense out there first to face the
uproaring instead of a freshman
quarterback, and let the offense

start the second half when
everything is settled down.

Didn't work quite as expected
since WVU scored on their third
play from scrimmage, but Pitt
answered and scored on their
first possession also. It was the
second week in a row that Pitt
and their opponent Scored on
their first possessions of the game.

9. Gottfried broke one of the
most important coaching axioms
in the book. He took points off
the board. Pitt had a field goal
late in the fourth quarter that
made the Score 51-24.

I wouldn’t even have
mentioned this, but somebody
actually commented that Gottfried
shouldn’t have. On the next play,
Richards took it in from the six
and made the score 51-28. There ’S
no question about it; he had to go
for the TD. Who ever mentioned
that they shouldn’t must have
been watching a different game.

Visions of acrobatic saves by
Mike Vernon are still dancing in

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

TheIwomen’s tennis team
went to Trenton, N .J., last
weekend for the Women’s
Intercollegiate Tournament
,and Pitt coach George
Dieffenbach desrcibed it as a
good championship in which
the team . gained valuable

‘ experience.

The most successful singles
performance for Pitt was by
Chris Orie, who was the only
member of the team to win a
singles match when she
defeated Doody of Pace
University 6-3, 7-5 in the
opening round. She then lost
her second round match to her
Georgetown opponent 6-3-, 6-
2, and the consolation final to
Rochester 6-1, 6-1. .

Although Julie LoPrinzi, Lisa

Heidi Price did not win any
singles matches, Dieffenbach
stressed the importance of the
tournament experience.

The team experienced more
success in the doubles
competition. Dieffenbach
praised the efforts of the
number one team of Erika
Devins and Loprinzi. He said,
“They won a lot of big

Women's tennis team
getting Valuable time

Kinney, Gwen McIntyre and ‘

matches.” Included in these
big-matches were teams from
Rochester and Drexel which
they won en route to winning
the consolation final.

The number two doubles
team of Kinney and McIntyre
also fared well.

Dieffenbach said, “They won
in the main draw which is
tough. They had a big win
over Cornell’s number two
team, 7-6, 6-4.”,

The number three doubles
team of Price and Orie did not
have the same success as their
teammates; they dropped their
two matches to St. Johns and
George Washington
University.

This tournament was
different than traditional
tournaments in that it was an
individual competition rather
than a team competition. There
were no team standings, just
individual standings.

Dieffenbach was more
concerned with the experience
than theresults. He said, “It
got us tournament—tough and
ready for the rest of our season
which includes a real tough
match match against Penn State
followed by the Big ‘East
Championships.”

The 1936 squad, under the
direction of Sutherland, won the
national championship with an

Those were the only teams in Pitt

While Gottfried cannot yet lay
claim to a national title, Saturday
