On Thursday at noon, the
University of Pittsburgh
Faculty for Social Responsibil-
ity will be showcasing an in-
ventory of 1 10courses offered
by 19 departments that relate
to world peace. A ’

Dr. Robert S. Marin, presi-

- dent of the FSR said, ”This is

a listing’ of courses being

. offered throughout the year, in

almost any discipline, that

deal with peace, world order,

social justice and ecological
balance.”

Thecourses are all part of an
attempt by the FSR to begin a

and World Studies. The pro-
gram would consist of a series
of classes designed to raise
consciousness among students
in all areas of world problems.
”We want to increase peo-
ple's consciousness in this.
area,” Marin said. ”The course
we are offering next, term
through the University Honors
College — Rethinking Securi-
ty in the Nuclear Age — is
designed to examine the risks
of nuclear war and the possi-
ble consequences, in terms of
scientific knowledge.”
According to Marin, the ,
class is ”a way to directly ad-
dress the issues of security.”
They've gathered 15 faculty
members from the university

World Peace Certificate being considered

to come in and guest-lecture
the UHC class and look at the
basic questions of war and
peace, according to Professor
John Townsend, one of the
two co—teachers of the class.

”The class could probably
be called ‘Everything you
wanted to know about nation-
al security but were afraid to
ask,’ ” continued Townsend.

Townsen_d also said the
guest lecturers are going to talk
on a variety of subjects, and
that they've alreadyisecured a
professor from the law depart-
ment and ‘several political
scientists. ”We’re still looking
for an ROTC representative,”
he said.

Marin said that the course

intends to look at the different
topics and possible solutions
to world problems.

”We will be looking at secu-
rity at a global level,” Marin
said. ”We want to explore al-
ternatives to military moves in
the event of a conflict.”

According to Marin, the
course is designed to cause a
”rethinking of one’s own
values and the exploring of
one’s own positions on peace
and world order.”

"we want them [students] to
develop a sense of knowledge
about things in our own coun-
try and the world,” Marin con- .
tinued.~ ’’I care about the world
because I'm concerned about
people, period.”

Officer

uses CPR 

to save

man's life 

By Merritt Neale Jr.
Staff Writer

Pitt police reported various in-
cidents at last Saturday night's
Pitt—Penn State football game, in-

cluding a Pitt policeman’s life-»

saving treatment of an elderly
man.

According to a police report,
Officer Frank Ku|w_ik responded
to an emergency call at gate No.
5 in Pitt Stadium at approximate-
ly 7:30 p.m. Upon arrival, he
found an elderly man uncons-
cious. on the ground.-

Thereport said that it was be.-

lieved that the unidentified elder-
ly man suffered a cardiac arrest,
and when Kulwik arrived, the

man was considered dead. Police .

notified paramedics of the situa-
tion when Kulwik and another"

unidentified man began to ad- g

minister CPR.

Within minutes, the man began
to breathe. The man was then
transported to Presbyterian

' Hospital, where he was listed in .

critical but stable condition.

Walt Waters, assistant director ‘
of the campus police, said that

the City Medic Command con-
tacted him and said that they

were ”impressed” by Kulwik’s ‘

actions. I

Kulwik said that any praise to
him was not neccessary. ’’l was
just doing my job," he said.

After the game, police report-
ed 17 arrests for public intoxica-
tion and eight for disorderly
conduct

Police also said a fight broke
out between several Pitt and

Problems with teenage suicide discussed at Pitt

Lisa Molinaro
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh's
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic Services for Teenagers at
Risk pvresented a conference to
alert people to the problem of
suicide. ’

The event was held Monday in
the William Pitt Union Assembly
Room and was aimed especially
toward educators, school ad--
ministrators and other profession-

A Ials -inrthe youth service field.'.

Allen Kukovich, representative

_ of the 56th Legislative District

(Westmoreland County), dis-
cussed’ the efforts of the State
Legislature to meet the needs of
teenagers considered’ at risk of
suicide. A

David Brent, M.D., an assistant

I professor of child psychiatry and_
co-director of STAR, described .

the ”teenager at risk.”

”While it is true that most peo-
ple who talk about suicide don’t_

do it, they are still at -_a higher risk

rnent of a teenager who has at-

than those who don't talk about
it,” said Brent.

According to Brent, teenagers
at risk are likely to be impulsive,
feel hopeless, exhibit poor social
and problem-solving skills and
have a tendency toward perfec-
tionism. These teenagers are also
likely to live in a social environ-
ment where there is violence or
abuse, exposure to’ suicidality
and the availabilityof ‘at lethal
agent
‘ When ‘STAR _is faced with treat-

 

terhpted suicide, its first mode of
action is to make up a verbal no-
suicide cont‘ract_with the patient
and his family. The contract asks
the patient to promise not to hurt
himself and to contact his coun-
selor if the suicidal urge returns.
Mary Margaret Kerr, also co-
director of STAR and associate
professor of child psychiatry and
special education, explained how
the school system could help to
identify students at risk. ’-‘School
information is extremely impor-../
tant andwill help in the di,a8n6,s-

 

 

tic process,” she said.

Charles Goldstein, clinical
coordinator for STAR, discussed
treatment of teenagers at risk.

Goldstein said most suicidal
teenagers have maladaptive cop-
ing skills like cognitive disorders
or poor affect regulation. He said

their main tactic for helping sui- .

cidal teens is to get them to iden-

tify their feelings and to learn

how tocope with them. The pa-
tient has to identify his problem
and list and choose alternatives

Republicans wonder: ‘Will-Ro

WASHINGTON — Establish-
ment Republicans are waiting for
a sign that Pat Robertson's early
surprises in the 1988 presidential

. race were aberrations not likely
« to be repeated once the contest

gets serious.

They didn't get their wish when
the latest test was held Saturday
in Orlando, Fla.

The best that could be said for
the straw poll at the Florida
Republican Party convention was
that Robertson and Vice President
George Bush managed-to defy
the law of physics that says two
objects can't occupy the same
space at the same time.

Both were able to claim victo-
ry. The other four GOP presiden-
tial contenders took a ”so—what”
approach to the event they
claimed was rigged to produce a
certain majority for Bush.

On the face of it, Bush came
away with what his campaign
manager called ”a good healthy

_ win.”

The vice president received 57
percent of the votes while form-
er television evangelist Robertson

' got 37 percent.

Robertson had embarrassed the
vice president in earlier tests in
Michigan, South Carolina and
Iowa.

”|’m claiming victory on our
terms,” said Robertson’s cam-
paign manager Marc Nuttle. ”|t’s
now a two-man race in Florida,
a Bush—Robertson race.”

Senate GOP leader Bob Dole
would dispute that assessment. A
recent opinion poll in Florida said
Bush was the leader with support
of 43 percent of Republicans;
Dole was second with 24 percent
and Robertson third with 9
percent.

In vestigators open up

airline crash probe

ROMULUS, Mich. — Federal
investigators Monday opened the
public portion of their probe into
the crash of a Northwest Airlines
jet that killed 156 people, but the
panel was faced with conflicting
transcripts of cockpit conver-
sation.

The hearing by the National
Transportation Safety Board was
expected to last all week on the
crash at Detroit Metropolitan Air-

port exactly three months ago.

The only survivor of the crash
at the Detroit Metropolitan Air-
port was 4-year-old Cecilia Ci-
chan, whose parents and
6-year-old brother were among
the 154 passengers and crew
killed. Two people on the ground
died.

Although the NTSB isn't ex-
pected to issue a report for
months, some parts of its investi-
gation have been made public.
Much of the information has fo-
cused on the airp|ane’s flaps and
a cockpit alarm system. ,

Trouble apparently began even
before the plane began its roll
down the runway on Aug. 16.

A transcript of the cockpit voice
recording released by the NTSB
indicated that Capt. John Maus
and co-pilot David Dodds failed
to check the plane's flaps during
a pre-flight check. When extend-
ed, flaps provide additional lift at
low speeds during takeoffs and
landings. ' ‘

Investigators have said the

BAS Black Week not

just for black students

The theme of Pitt's 1987 Black Week was ”A Celebration
i n‘ Pride,” designed to increase awareness and pride in black
culture. Black Week events scheduled throughout last week
included lectures by prominent black figures, gospel and dance
performances and a minority jobs fair, in which students had
the opportunity to speak with representatives from 70 region-
al and national companies. 

The Black Action Society, sponser of Black Week, encouraged
’students..of every nationality to ‘participate in all scheduled
events. However, the general response among the non-black
student body was apathetic.

Though Black Week is _a celebration for blackpeople, it is
also a valuable opportunity for everyone to experience black
heritage, views and aspirations. The recognition of all minori-
tiesis imperative to healthy relations in our society. Yet, to ex-
press one's culture and nationality is not enough. All minorities
must recognize and understand one another. Too often, socie-
ty merely tolerates the existence of its minorities rather than
appreciating them.

The events held last week were not exclusively designed to
please only blacks. Anyone with an interest in politics, music,
job opportunities and food could have enjoyed themselves.

Tensions between races can only dissipate when communi-
cation is established. If races can not communicate on a sched-
uled level, what hope do they have of abolishing prejudice?

Black Week is aprogressive step torward racial harmony.
However, withoutthe significant involvement of everyone, it
is wasted.

World order is a vital
interest in Pitt studies

Pitt's Faculty for Social Responsibility is attempting to organize

_a new certificate program called Peace and World Order

Studies. Similar programs exist at over 150 universities across
the country. If Pitt truly offers a program of liberal education

for its students, it would be highly advantageous to incorporate

this program into the university curriculum.

If Pitt aspires to be as great as its new motto, ”Pioneering
the Future,” then exploring the all-important field of peace is
something that cannot be ignored. There is no excuse for not
offering a program that could only benefit the student body and
enhance understanding of world affairs. The world is infinitely
more complex than it was a generation ago, and it is only get-
ting more difficult to interpret. To be the ”Campus of the Fu-
ture,” Pitt must allow students the opportunity to learn how
things that happen today affect what will be tomorrow.

In a nutshell 

It's horrible to think you've got-
ta be a miserable son of a bitch to
write a good song.

Talk about/pop muzik. Shoo be
doo be do wop.

Pop music is back. It is now
cool to speak lovingly of, the
mega-successes of Bruce Spring-

steen and Prince. There are even

some folks, if you can believe
this, that have publicly expressed
interest in Michael Jackson.

In an interview in Creem, the
guitarist for R.E.M. said, ”Some-
one like Springsteen, who is real-

Vly good, made a’ conscious,

calculated concession to have a
really huge hitwith Born in the

U.S.A. And that's fine —— anartist A

of that type sometimes makes
sense only in front of a million
people.” 4

Which, I suppose, is to say that
the audience and their sentiments
have become an inseparable part
of music, and that their percep-
tions of whatthe artist is saying
can be more important than what
he or she is actually saying. Pop
music has become an ex-

perience, a way of life and a way '

of reckoning.

Bruce plays to a stadium of
70,000, and it means something.
He plays on your stereo at home
and, well, you can dance to it.
There must be a piece of think-
ing here that's eluding me. When

we beginto make distinctions

about the environment in which
music has meaning, the music
becomes a part of. the evil it
hopes to change. Witness the
ticket sales for a Bruce Spring-

steen show. A huge amount of .

money is taken in from people
who can obviously afford to
spend $17 + for a concert ticket,
and the loot is then split between
the performer, the managers, the
concert hall and a raft of other
hangers—on.

Thus, the audience has paid to
hear about the problems of the
common man, the singer gets
paid to sing about the problems
of the common man, and the
common man, predictably, re-
mains unaffected by the whole
business. Sure, an occasional
check is written to help a local
food bank or a school for the
blind, but the amounts always
fade into insignificance when
viewed against the total take.

The world goes to hell, and we

sit idly by — tapping our feet. But 4

the beat is great, man. Like, you
know, I can dance to it. Like, hey
dude, this is, like great.

Aaaaack, to quote that venera-
ble pop philosopher that happens
to look like a burned—out house
pet. Berke Breathed speaks for
the masses in that one little word.

There is another head to this
monster. There is underground,
(alternative, punk, hard-core? —
call itwhat you will) which is lit-
tle more than a collection of ele-
gantly dropped social stigma, a
walking portrait of angst, music
that sees no problem with ‘being
unlistenable. The world is un-
listenable. The problems are un-
changeable. My clothes are sooo
black. What's the point of doing
anything. Truly a viable alter-
native.

Take, for example, the rise in
popularity in ”underground”
labels. What the hell does that
mean? Wouldn't a band cease to
be identifiable as underground as
soon as they get popular? Or is
it more of the ”I’m going to ex-
press my individuality by wearing
leather like all those other peo-
ple” syndrome?

Maybe none of that says any-
thing about the current state of af-
fairs in , popular music. Upon
reflection, I suppose it's no worse
or better than the pop trash of a
decade ago now being pawned
off on an unsuspecting public as
oldies. ‘

It is also possible (I say with a
grimace) that pop is getting bet-
ter, that the audience is becom-
ing educated and demanding a

 

fore. Nahh. Wishful thinking at
best. ' ’

I don't know whatbrought all
that on. I like a little pop music.
There are some songs in the Top

40 that I actually enjoy listening .

to. In private, that is. I wouldn't
want anyone to know I secretly
switch the channel to

WBZZzzz... on occasion when I. ‘

need a little pick-me-up.

I heard a song by some lady
named Tiffany, ”I Think We're
Alone Now,” that wasn’t too bad
for a remake. Not that I have any-

thing against a good remake. Jimi-'
Hendrix did some really interest— -

ing things with Bob Dylan's ”All
"Along The Watchtower.” ‘
In the end, there are going to
becontradictionsin any exami-
nation of popular culture._There
are going to be good songs that

are misunderstood. There are go-V

ing to be honest sentiments
which are sloganized, and there
are going to be fun, happy-go-
lucky songs that wind up having
a great deal of impact.

It seems important to remem-
ber, though, that music, unless
you make your living playing it,
is a diversion. It is entertainment.
Entertainment that can occasion-

allyteach us something, but en-I

tertainment nonetheless.

Take a song out of its popular
context, and it can wind up
meaning very little. Take a star
out of his arena, and he can mean
even less. The myth and the style
surrounding music and discus-
sion of it are just trappings.

THE PITT NEWS

Tuesday, November l7, I987:

Noll will start struggling Malone next week

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer ‘

The Pittsburgh Steelers offense
is one of the NFL’s least produc-
tive, and Mark Malone has the
league's lowest quarterback rat-
ing, but Coach Chuck Noll said
Monday he isn't going to bench
the oft-booed Malone. _

Noll lifted the struggling quar-
terback in the second half of Sun-
day's 23-3 loss to the Houston
Oilers but said at his weekly
news conference that backup
Bubby Brister won't start this Sun-
day against the Cincinnati
Bengals.

”Bubby’s got to ease into it a

little more,” Noll said. ”Bubby V

needs time.  Mark is the guy we
feel we can win with, and we're
going" to go from there.”
Malone has completed only
41.5 percent of his passes —— by
far the worst percentage of any
NFL starting quarterback —— and
was only seven of 22 for 89 yards
and an interception against
Houston. But Brister, a second-
year pro, wasn't much better,
completing three of seven for 10
yards and two interceptions.
”Bubby was under a lot of pres-
sure, but sometimes you want to
see what a guy can do under
pressure,” Noll said. ’’In a sense,
it wasn't fair to throw him in there

Freshmen play big
part-in Pitt's 86-80
win over Canadians

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

Paul Evans didn't care if his Pitt

' Panther basketball team defeated

the Canadian National Team in
last night's exhibition game at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Evans wanted to use the game
as an opportunity to work his four
freshman into the lineup and he
did just that. Pitt still won, 86-80.

Freshmen Jason Matthews and

Darelle Porter started the game ‘

and Sean Miller and Bobby Mar-
tin received plenty of playing
time. The four played 89 minutes
combined — close to half of Pitt's
200 minutes. I

’’It was a good opener in that .

we got a lot of minutes for our

‘four freshman, which is some-

thing we wanted to do. We wer-

» en’t really concerned with the
score,” said‘Evans.

' Matthews finished the game
with 15 points, while Miller had
six points and five assists. Porter
added four points and Martin had
six, all in the_ first half. ‘

Pitt fans even got a glimpse of
what could be the Panthers’
inside—outside combination of the
future when Miller hit Martin
with a perfect alley-oop pass for
a slam dunk with :31 left in the
first half.

Pitt center Charles Smith, who
led the Panthers with 25 points,
10 rebounds and four blocked
shots, was very impressed with
the play of the freshmen.

’.’[The freshmen] played real
well. They took the challenge. Ja-
son knew he was guarding their
best player (guard Jay Triano) in
the beginning of the game. He
was up for it and he did a good
job. He should be proud of him-
self,” Smith said.

Matthews, who was informed
by Evans over the weekend he
would start, said,”In the man
defense I did a_good job. In the
zone I need some work because
[Triano] got some shots of.”

Matthews said he wasn't ner-
vous about starting, but Evans
wasn't so sure that was the case.

”Jason comes from a high
school where they get 150, 200

kids a game, so when the (Pitt)
band blasted that first note, I
thought he was going to head for
the locker room,” said Evans.

Miller played 21 minutes at
point guard, while sophomore
Pat Cavanaugh,iwho started the
game, played 19. Evans said this
wasn't an indication of a possible
position change at point guard,
but he wanted to get Miller some
quality minutes.

”Sean has come in here with a
lot of pressure. Everybody knows
him (Miller is from nearby Black-
hawk High School) and he's ex-
pected to come in here and be a
savior. I think he played very well

tonight,” said Evans. ‘

‘Smith also liked what he saw
of.—Mil|er. ”Sean did exactly what
I didn't think he was ready to do.
He ran the team totally. In the first
half he was sort of quiet, but in
the second half he picked up and
ran the whole ballclub. He was
telling me and Jerome [Lane]
what defense we were in, and
that's exactly what we need. Sean
stepped in and did the job.”

Pitt led 33-19 with 6:11 left in
the first half, but Triano hit four
three-point baskets, leading
Canada to a surprising 42-40 hal-
ftime advantange. Triano finished
the game with 39 points, 30 of
which came on 10 three-point
field goals.

”fTriano’s] a good player. He's
been scoring 25, 30 points a a
game against the Big East teams.
Hecould play in the Big East with
no problem,” said Evans.

”When we were up 13 or so
the reason [Canada] came back,
and I'm not taking anything away
from them, is we made the errors
that put them back in the game,”
said Smith.

In the second half Pitt took the
lead for good, 48-47, on a Mat-
thews.’ layup on a fast—break pass
from Cavanaugh with 15:28 re-
maining.  ‘ 2

Canada was only able to come
within two points of Pitt the rest
of the game. __

Evans said he was disappoint-
ed in Pitt's work on the-boards,
although ‘the Panthers had ’a
37-29 edge in the rebounding

under those kind of conditions,
but that's the catch—22, to get him
the experience he needs without
playing him.”

Noll said the fans’ increasing-
ly negative reaction hasn't helped
Malone, who has been booed
heavily since the players’ strike
ended last month. The jeering is
even worse than that Terry Brad-
shaw received in the early stages
of his career, when fans once
cheered because he had to leave
a game with an injury.

”I’ve never seen anything like
it,” said Noll. ”There’s no doubt
about it that it has affected Mark
and other players, too. And it
won't get‘ better until things start

/

going well. The fans are angry,
and it's just not here, it's all over
the country.”

The Steeler offense has gener-
ated only seven touchdowns in
the regulars’ six games, only three
more TDs than their defense has
scored. Their usually productive
running game has often struggled
because Malone’s poor passing
has allowed opposing defenses to
key on stopping the run.

Malone has completed only 78
of.188 passes for 919 yards, five
touchdowns and nine intercep-
tions and has a 45.9 quarterback
rating. He has been hampered by
the loss of his chief deep receiv-
ing threat, Louis Lipps, who

hasn't played since the second
week of the season because of a
hamstring injury.

The Steeler offense also was
without its top rusher, Earnest
Jackson, for most of the Oilers
game after he injured his back on
what Jackson claimed was a late
hit by nose tackle Charles Martin.

Television replays showed
Jackson was speared by Martin a

split-second after being tackled -
by linebacker Robert Lyles. No ’

penalty was called, 8

”The guy who did it knows he

took a late shot at me,” Jackson

said. ”He just came with 300. I

pounds and dove on my back.”

department. Lane, who led the
country in rebounding last sea-
son, had to be the main reason
for Evans’ criticism as he only
pulled down four rebounds.

Evans also said Pitt needs to im—”

prove its zone defenses.
Overall, though, Evans was
pleased with the outcome of the
game. ”We wanted to get 10
minutes out of our 1-=2-2 defense

Panthers crack Top 20 in AP poll

By Hershel Nissenson

Five days before their annual‘

shootout, Nebraska replaced
season-long leader Oklahoma as
the No. 1 team in The Associat-
ed Press college football poll.

The Cornhuskers were idle last‘

weekend — their game with
Colorado was switched to Nov.

games.

Nebraska, 9-0, received 32 of
60 first-place votes and 1,164 of

17-13, rece ved 20 first-place
votes and 1,128 points.

The remaining eight first-place
votes went to Miami of Florida,
which is No. 3 for the eighth
week in a row. The Hurricanes,
8-0, defeated Virginia Tech 27-13
and received 1,101 points.

Neither Nebraska Coach Tom
Osborne nor Oklahoma's -Barry
Switzer was overly concerned by
the switch, which spoiled Okla-
homa’s bid to become the first
team ever to be ranked No. 1
from the preseason throughthe
postbowl poll.

’’It doesn't really matter much
one way or the other,” Osborne
said. ”Nebraska and Oklahoma
are going to play, and it ‘will be
settled on Saturday.”

Switzer said he ”didn’t expect
to be (No. 1) after the way we

leg, and they would twist it when

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November I7, I987

Matt Gerhard and the restof the Panther wrestling team will begin their season tomorrow night against Waynesburg.

Wrestlers ready for season despite injuries:

By Vince Carey’
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team starts its
new season Wednesday night at
Fitzgerald Field House against
Waynesburg University at 7:30.

”We have a good lineup th-is
year,” said Pitt head coach Rande
Stottlemyer. ”We have a few in-
juries to start with, but it is some-
thing we are going to have to
work through.”

At the 1 18—pound weight class,
Pitt will go with Brian O’Korn. In
an elimination match that took
place last week, O’Korn was able
to beat out Matt Rizzo,_ last year's
starter. ‘ '

There is no change at 126
pounds, where Matt Gerhard will

V try to pick up where he left off last

yeah . -

The stronghold of the Pitt
lineup is at 142 pounds with All-
America Pat Santoro. ”Without a
doubt, Pat is our thoroughbred,”
said Stottlemyer. ”We expect him
to be our best.”

Last year, seniors Gary Bolin
(150 pounds) and Eric Wertz (158

pounds) were able to follow-San-

toro in the lineup. To start off the
season, Pitt will go with freshman
Scott Hovan and junior Mike Ros-
si, respectively.

”Scott is our top freshman,”
said Stottlemyer. ”He was a two-

. time Pennsylvania state champi-

on in high school. He is a real
treat to work with. Mike [Rossi]
is a key on the mat. He is one of
the guys that has to come through
for us.”

The rest of the lineup isBiIl
Lewis at 167 pounds, Mike Ton-.
gel at 177 pounds and Matt Ar-
mour and John Owens at
heavyweight. »

”Last year, I could pinpoint"
. who the horses.were,” said Stott-—-_

Iemyer. “This team is hard to peg.
We have a great bunch of guys,
and they all have been working
hard. We'll just have to wait and
see who will be able to jump out
of the pack.” I

The key to the Panthers this
season will be Gerhard, Tongel,
Owens and Rossi. If they can
have a successful season so will
the Pitt team‘. ‘

’’I am very pleased with our

A heavyweights,” said Stottlemyer.‘

”This is the first time in a long
time that I have had true
heavyweights to work with. Itwill
be no comparison with last year.”

The Panthers have a very
young team going into the "sea-
son. There is only one senior
(Tongel); so, some might say that
Pitt is heading for a rebuilding
season.

But Stottlemyer sees it different-
ly, ”We have a young team, but
a very solid team. Plus we have
much more depth on the team.
Overall, we are better now than

Again, this year, Pittis a part of
the very tough Eastern Wrestling
League. The best is Penn State,
but the rest of the teams aren't
very far behind.

”At this -point, we are not ex-
actly sure what we are getting
into,” said Stottlemyer. ”Every
team on our schedule is tough.
You could either see this as a big
challenge or get scared by it. I'm
not afraid, and I'm excited about
it. ‘ ‘

”Waynesburg is a- good team to
open with. They aren't a division
one school, but they will get us
ready for the grind of the season.”

A‘ few Pitt wrestlers competed
in an open tournament at West
Virginia this past weekend. San-
toro captured Pitt's only first
place of the day. Rossi and Ton-
gel each took seconds, and Ge-
orge McCormack pulled off a
fourth place.

”The guys wrestled well. I was

very pleased," said Stottlemyer.
”I am looking forward for the sea-

last year.”
