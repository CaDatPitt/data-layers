Posvar Witness to Coup

' by SHARON SEXTON
Editor

On Tuesday. Chancellor Wesley
Posvar returned from Kabul. Af-
ganistan. where. for six days. he
had been an eye-witness to the

military take-over engineered
there by.Sadar Daud I
Posvar. accompanied by his

wife. arrived in Kabul last week

to visit friends in the diplomatic “

corps and also to meet several
University students participating
in Pitt's “Project Afganistan" in
Kabul. _

-On Monday, July 16, Posvar

and his wife attended a reception

for government officials. During
the course of the reception they
were introduced to several high
Afghan officials, including the
Minister of Defense. /

Several hours after Posvar re-
tired for the night. the Minister of’
Defense. along with the royal
family and other important poli-
tical figures of the old regime
were arrested in what Posvar
called a “classic and magnificent-'
ly staged military coup.“ A

Posvar ‘awoke the following
morning "and "unaware of the
events. of the night before. ven-
tured into the street for a walk be-
fore breakfast." ,

He_ found the streets deserted

and silent with the exception of a
platoon of soldiers. "Still unsus-

pecting, he returned to the home
of the American ' ambassador
where he was a guestand re-
quested a car. A servant informed
him that this wasimpossible as

the night before the King had been H
A deposed and the city was under”

siege. The Ambassador soon re-
_turned home and confired this.

Reports since the takeover
have talked of a "bloody revolu-
tion." Posvar says this seems to
have not been the case. The coup
involved only a few hundred se-
lected military personnel and only
a few Soviet-built tanks. Posvar
believes that because it took the
country by complete surprise
there was no chance for any or-
ganized resistance. He speculated
that only a few dozen people ac-
tually died in the revolution. al-
though many more were impris-
oned. .

During the six days that he re-
mained in Kabul. Posvar was al-
lowed to travel within the city the
city. though several sectors. in-

cluding the palace. were off-lim-_

its. He claims that the army
personnel. who stood guard at vir-
tually every street corner in the
city. were not unfriendly. The
Chancellor did say. however. that
they all carried machine guns
which they waved \nonchalantly.
and rather disarmingly from their
hips at anyone who approached
them.

Scaife Museum on Course
fo Fall '74 Comp/efion

by MICHAEL CLINTON

Late last year the Carnegie In-
stitute announced that a_ new art
gallery. currently under construc-
tion. was being presented to the
Institute and to Pittsburghers as
a giftfrom the Sarah MellonScaife
Foundation and the Scaite family.

The $12 million‘ dollar Sarah M.
Scaife Gallery is named after the
late sister of the late Richard
King l\/I'el_lon. one of Pittsburgh's
most noted philanthropists._

NEW BUILDING provides backdrop for fuimiliar statue. ; R‘ I .

The gallery will take up five
acres of land"adding to the exist-
'ing five-acre cultural ‘and educa-
tional ‘center, in the Oakland sec-
tion and will‘ provide a home for
the collection of works acquired
for the Institute by Sarah Scaife
before _her death in 1965.

In a recentarticle in Carnegie

Magazine, plans for the construe» ’
tion of the building were detailed,

by the architect. Edward Lara-
bee Barnes of New York.
(Continued on Page 3)

 

Posvar explained that there "is
in the city and the surrounding
areas a fear of a later stage of
bloodshed. The possibility of a
mobilization of the Afghani hill
tripes and an apprehension over
the future role of the Soviet Union
in the new regime are both very
real fears for many Afghans.

In the meantime. Posvar ‘says
that there is a net feeling of grati— .
fication. The youth. unhappy with

' a monarchy which had on occasion

been violent against students.
were generally pleased with the
takeover. Lower income‘ and So-
viet-trained citizens were also
happy to see the last of the old
government. '

Posvar and his wife left the
country on the first plane to fly
out of the Kabul airport after the
coup.

Convictions Reconsidered

Poi Laws Beings Revised

by CHRIS CIEPLY
Last year‘s easing of Pennsyl-
vania laws regarding marijuana

has not made things easier for all '

convicted pot offenders.

Although possession of mari- .
 juana is now classed as a misde-

meanor. about 20 Pennsylvanians
are in jail and 600 others are on
parole from felony- convictions
made when 1951 laws were in ef-

fect. , I

A bill now awaiting Governor‘

Milton J. Shapp’s signature,‘spon-
sored by State Rep. Joseph
Rhodes, Jr., D-East Liberty,
would allow resentencing of those
convicted before implementation
of the June, 1-972, code changes.

Student pot offenders. however.

I are often, still subject to other

penalties._Earlier this year. the
Pittsburgh Pre/ss told the story of
a Pittsburgh.area student at one
"of the state colleges whose driv-
eifs-license and state aid were
stripped from him due to a felony
charge he received for pot posses-
sion. Although individuals have
vouched for his character. there
is as yet no word‘ as to whether
he will be reconsidered.

In May, two Robert Morris Col-
lege students were suspended for

‘possession of marijuana and hash-

ish in violation of college regula-
tions against “narcotic drugs.”
Even under the new _laws. it
would be inaccurate to say that
pot has been "decriminalizedi"
Possession of pot or hash for per-
sonal use iunder 30 grams of pot
or eight grams of hashi can still

_ draw a 30-day jail sentence and or

a_$500 fine or both.

Persons who have more than
theseamounts. or any amount at
all of illegal drugs other than pot
or hash. are subject to _a one-.
year sentence and or a*$5.000,

= fine‘, For first-Atiinje.-pot off'en.dei;_s.

'_:.;,

probation without verdict is often
possible.

The original 1951 law. which
classified "marijuana as a f'nar-
cotic." specified a maximum five-
year sentence or a $2.000 fine. or
both. -for offenders. State legis-
lators approved the 1972 bill as
the “most. realistic“ approach
short of ‘legalization. and also to
bring Pennsylvania codes into line

I with those of surrounding states.

..Cool<ing — Serious Business

  - by CHRIS CIEPLY
 "‘What’s cooking?"

 i, If the question is put to Joseph
0’,-Parrotto during his typical work-
 ing day. the answercould be any-
ylgthing from sauerbraten to scallo-
- _ "pine to a spicy Indian curry dish.

,_ H Parrotto, chef at the presti-
" V __."'gious University Club, ‘describes
himself as a cook who specializes

ily. Parrotto admits that his
schedule is difficult for his family
to adjust to. '

The kind of gourmet cooking
Parrotto likes to practice is. he
said. rapidly vanishing from pub-
lic restaurants because of the ex-
pense involved.

Besides the regular array of
menu choices, Parrotto and his

assistants prepare specialties
from other nations on designated
‘_‘International Nights” at the
Club: “German Night_ and ‘Italian
Night are the most popular,” he

’ said. “On those nights we get
. 300 to 400 people here easily.”

‘The well-fed looking-chef says

he taste-tests everything before
it goes out to be served. to make
sure there are no mess ups;
"That‘s about 90 different dishes.
It‘s a lot of food.

Culinary affairs have been part
of Parrotto’s life since he was a
teenager. After his graduation
from high school. he studied for
two years at the Culinary Institute
of America. and get his first res-
taurant job at age 20. "It was
just kitchen chores and helping
the cooks. but it was still a job."

Parrotto worked in public res-

taurants for two years. He spent
his summers in‘New Hampshire

I and Massachusetts, and "his win-

ters in Florida.

A six-month stay in Montreal
soon followed. “I think if I would-
n't have had to worry about taking
Canadian citizenship. I might
have stayed on there." -said Par-
rotto. ' -

Upon his return to Pittsburgh.‘

he took the position of chef at the
Carlton House Hotel and remain-
ed there ‘for two years before
switching to the University Club.

When the chef is at home, it is.

Parrotto’s wife who does the
cookingfor him and their two
sons. The family usually prefers

‘Italian food-

"Spaghetti is the kids" favor-
ite." he grinned. "Me. I don't have
a favorite.-I like everything."

Food and its possibilities have
provided both pleasures and hard-

ships for Parrotto. Nevertheless.

he would not trade his work for
any other- "I knew before I got

into this What it wouldvinvolve. If

I didntenjoy being a chef I.would-
n'1 have stuck with it for so long."

Budgets l~°ossed, Union
Fee Discussed Al S.G.

by KAREN Bunoio

Student Government announced at Tuesday night's meeting that
the quick thinking of a University student has repealed the 10C check

cashing fee installed by the University last month. The action was re- V

plealed because it did not meet the Presidents Phase Four budget in-
creases. . .
The informal SG meeting passed all four proposed budgets—Com-
muter Association. Student Government. Black Action Society. and
Greek Week. with a minimum of discussion and acceptance of the A110-
cations Committee’s recommendations. I -

In the president’s report, Rege Kaufman said that he is meeting
with Registrar Frank Reed to discuss invoices policy. ‘Reed hasAsug-

Igestedthat invoices that are not received in the Registrar's Office by

the duedate will bevoided, unless the student had some difficulty
meeting the due date. . -

Reed told Kaufman that as many as 1.000 students do not pay their

invoices on time. take classes and drop out before the ter’m’s end. cost-.
ing the U.niversitymoney. ' "

Kaufman also announced the possibility of chartering a train to the-

first Pitt football game of the season at Georgia. - . -
_Janet Toth reported that‘ the Homecoming Committeelost the bid

for Emerson, Lake and Palmer and Lily Tomlin for the Homecoming‘

Concert and that this year’s Homecoming favors will be blue and gold
visors. . ' -

The possibility of a,Student Union fee to provide revenue for a
new Union or-renovation was also announced. but the Board is checking
with the National Student Association and pending the information
from that inquiry might hold a referendum on the matter. .

The Intercultural House. an ex-
periment in inter-racial living.

has recently become an experi-

ment in cneducation.

. Miriam 'Klaiman became the,
first female member of tthe”House.

which for the three years of its
existence has had only male mem-
bers. on May 1 of this year.

“I am siﬁcerely committed to
feminism, and so the IC House,
with its goal of an openvexchange

of ideas,_ can become a chance for '
better ‘understanding among all .-

humans,” said Klaiman, who is a
senior.

After attending a House Sem-
inar and being "impressed by the

stimulating intellectual and inter-

personal atmosphere of the

V House." Klaiman decided to put in

a membership application."

She :;plained that the applica-
tion was- fa form of protest
against the heretofore ‘entirely
male membership.“ 

When Klaiman was later inter-

viewed by IC House members she’

was. again “impressed by their
straight-forward questions and
the totally non-sexist attitude of
questioning.” ' "

Terry Sadler. a House -member.
explained that there wasn‘t the
least bit of interest. in the fact
that Klaiman was female.

"We were only interested in her

intellectual and humanistic qual-

ifications.“ said Sadler. "since
she believes in. this attempt at
letting members of differing cul-

- tures live and work together. then

that's all that matters."

Another House member, Zoila
Silva, sees Klaiman’s admission
in terms of “thoroughly huminis-
tic approach to living” that it pro-
poses. '

"Living with Mimi (Klaimani
is ess_entially no different than
. living with men._Communication
is communication. If you accept

the premise that we-are all human-

beings and undertake it at this
level. that's the ‘crucial thing." ex-

. 5 plained Silva.

Klairna-n stressed the impor-
tance of gaining female members
for the-IC House. which is still

taking- applications for the fall

and winter.

"Anyone interested in supple-
menting‘ their intellectual exper-
ience here at Pitt with animal-
uable social experience should
certainly apply to the House.“
said Klaiman.

(Continued from'Pzrge 1)

He explained that the gallery
"must stand on its own as a sep-
arate building. yet relate grace-
fully to the present 65-year-old
Institute building." He stressed
the importance of flow. so the vis-
itors "'will not be conscious of
leaving one building and entering
another."

, Barnes also added that “al-
though it is a totally new building,
it must also be an extension to the
past.”

The gallery. which is construct-
ed of gray granite. was especially
selected to blend with the grayed
sandstone of the existing gallery.

RQJ. Gangewere. staff member
of the —Institute's public relations
department and associate editor
of Carnegie Magazine, described
the set-up of the building and how
the completed work will appear
to the public.

He explained that "at the Forbes
Avenue, entrance. visitors will
find ‘behind the glass facade a
great lobby which will include a
cafe. and an enlarged art shop,

“A 180-"seat auditorium, appro-
ximately -one-third the size of the
present Lecture Hall, and a chil-
dren’s room will be located on
the lower level at the rear of the
building.

"The second floor will be oc-
cupied by exhibition galleries sky-
lighted with a new kind of metal

  Resignation?

by SCOTT MacLEOD

Since the beginning of the-Wa-
'tergate investigations, there has
"been much hostility directed. to-

‘ wards the free press of this coun-

‘ try, and toward the increasing

' number of anti-Nixonites. Recent
"letters to editors have bluntly,
stated that. Senato/r,Sam Ervin

can "go straight to hell.”

 This anxiety is unmistakenly a

 reaction to what the Nixon lo_val-

A _ists have described as an un-

,  necessary and unwarranted at-

 ‘ tack upon the chief of the Repub-

f . _' lican Party.

 _ Even the President himself, ac-

 cording to the New York Times.
has told his closest aides that he

 — feels the Ervin Committee “is'out

 to get him.”

A’ These hostile and defensive re-
actions are absurd. Doesn't Rich-
ard Nixon know about the loyal
opposition? I’

.  _ -In 1940. after his election defeat

A. ‘ to Franklin Roosevelt. Wendell

 nWilkie delivered. a speech en-

 titled “The Loyal Opposition." He
said. “A strong. alert. and watch-
ful opposition in the balanced op-

_'eration of democracy is a vital

._ "eleVment."' - -

  
  
  
   
  

1.‘ _ “ "We who stand ready to serve
;.;". our country». .  _he continued.
 "retain the right. and I will say
I .r duty. to’ debate the course of our
""cou_ntry.“ ’ _

 “It will be from the suppression
 ‘T of the opposition that discord and
_-1 ‘jnrdisunity will arise,” Wilkie con-‘
 eluded.

 In this time of national crisis.
_-u A {we have been summoned to play
 the role of the loyal opposition
' once again. Here the players
must answer a vital question:
j',';I‘o answer the question of the
President's ability-to govern, we
j._must look at the situation both
. practically and theoretically.

, I Theoretically, it seems clear
 that the President will not. be able
 tocleanup his domestic policies
{ and clear up the Watergate Affair
a in time to pass much needed leg-
.s islation. - ' ’

i Practically, Mr. Nixon is in
 dangerous trouble. Regardless of
— any new revelations about his se-
cret actions and involvement, the
 President has already proven his
»_ guilt in a number of other areas.

 {Independent of any assump-
tions is Nixon’s admitted office
 and telephone bugging, which is
2 _illé‘gal according tofederal laws
I-passed" by our representatives.
 And the $2,000,000 landscaping
_  work done in San Clemente is no
longer a secret.

.y _ Constitutionally, his broad and
 sweeping claims of Executive
I’ Pri-vilege and immunity leaves

     
 
 
 
  

 

 
     
  

much to be admired. Politically.
his closest ally in the Senate.
Hugh Scott, has begun to have
some new ideas about Presiden-
tialpower.

Last. week Scott voted for a
measure that would reduce the
authority of the President in all
war‘-making decisions. The bill,
Nixon has said, will be vetoed, but
Senator Scott maintains that he
would still have to vote to over-
ride. ' ,
- With other issues such as eco-
nomic inflation. the Cambodia
bombing. coupled with his own
personal. legal. _and constitution-
al problems, it seems that Presi-
dent Richard Nixon will not be
able to function properly in that
role in the coming three and one-
half years.

Using this brief account as a
background, supplemented with
the reading of daily newspapers,

I would not hesitate to call for a

Presidential replacement.

There are two methods. im-
peachment with conviction. and
resignation.

Historically, impeachment has

been a popular idea in prosecut-'

ing public office holders. but in
terms of removing a President it
has proven unsuccessful.

I-share the belief that in the
case of removing President Nix-
on, it would be an unwise action,
if only because it would add con-
fusion to confusion.

 Along with the legislative,Wa-

tergate hearings. along with the
Archibald Cox investigation. along
with rising food prices and ab-

surd and unstable economic con- -

trols, we would have confusing
constitutional confrontations with
the beginning of impeachment
proceedings.

Indeed it would be chaotic. How-
ever, I reject the idea of many
that it would throw the govern-
ment into an unstable state of af-
fairs. This wasnot the case in
Andrew Johnson’s impeachment
trial.

Impeachment would prove to me
that our American democracy is
a strong system of government.
with proven capabilities of han-
dling internal crises.

But I maintain in these confus-
ing times, that we need some
immediate action. Removing the
President through the long dra-
matic process of impeachment
will delay the mending of our dom-
estic wounds, and the prosperity
we all hope will follow.

So, in playing the role of the loy-
al opposition. an opposition for
this nation, and not against. I be-
lieve the time has come to ask for

s a resignation.

Where’s the Sassafras?

joys of Warm-Weather   Learning

by GEORGE ZRUST
This‘ being the first time that I
am attending Pitt -Spring and
Summer Sessions. 1 am experienc-

_ing also for the first time the

unique joys of warm-weather
learning.
Like idiotically fast-paced

"courses with all the work of re-

gular 14-week offerings.

Likelhallways unpopulated by
courteous crowds of pushy stud-
ents. -

Like a relatively empty, almost
pleasant Student Union.

But enough. Unfortunately. I
cannot continue my laudatory
statements. As usual I have some-
thing to complain about. some-
thing which reminds me of a
mediocre popular song of a while
back called "Hot Smoke and Sas-
safras" (correct me if I'm wrong.
which is unlikely 1.

Actually, my problem is not
really “hot_ smoke” as such, since
this phrase so borders on tautol-
ogy that i is nonsensical." Rather,
I am suffering from the “hot”
and the “smoke” as individual

entities, but often in combina-.

tion. The sassafras is absent.

Let me be more specific.

If anyone has been following
my columns from the outset
(which is as unlikely as my be-
ing wrongi. then he. she it will
know of my position on smoking

(cigarettsi. Ihate it.

What people do. to their own
lungs is their business. but I
prefer my tar undershoe where
it should .be covering a pothole
or two. Yet smokers around me in-
sist on having me breathe the
foul humours of their coffin
nails.

This is bad enough. although

being the practical man that I

am. I seldom do or say any-

'thing. ,True.'I have written of

blowing the . smoke back into
smokers" faces. but this is hardly
standard practice with me.

_What is worse than cigaret
smoke, though, is cigaret-smoke
trapped in a hot classroom. . '

I have long found it’ uncon-
ceivable that people would close
the windows '
ditioned room on 80- and 90-
degree summer days. _I equate it"
with walking through an Alaskan
blizzard, while wearing .but a
loincloth.

People close the windows,
though, and they close the doors’,
too. Interestingly enough, often
the ,very people who believe in
a practice such group suffoca-
tion, are also the same people
who smoke heavily.

Witness my one class in the
Cathedral very recently. A heal-
thyyoung maiden. sitting by a
window] reached up and began

pulling down the sash. When she

in- an _un-air-con- .

proved inadequate for the task.
a second healthy maiden gave
her _a hand. and together. they ac-
complished the feat of closing the
window.

The first maiden showed a too-
thy smile of thankful glee to her

helper, Later, blue smoke be- ‘

gan to emanate from these good-
ly girls, who together had‘ just
created. a closed ‘classroom situ-
ation. Such comraderie. " '

"With other people in the room
-smoking. the characteristic stag-
nant haze hung over desks and
li-ghts. Granted. this was not the
hottest day. but similar situations
have indeed o”ccu-rred on the
swelterers. ,
In any. case. the classrooms
atmosphere was still oppressive.

Don’.t _ get _me wrong," though.
Iknow many people" who have a
smoking problem, and I have no
plans of making any big. issue
‘out of their death wish. I will
even let them be my friends. .

Sol don't really -hate the peo-

ple who like_ to -smoke when a_

room is closed to fresh. cooling
air. Ijust feel sorry for them. and
wish they would comeup with
either a cleaner or more private
way. of satisfying theirrcraving
for smoke when itis hot.

Maybe that is where the sassa-
fras comes in. ~

Column anda Halfk

by JOHN METCALFE
I was going to have a cartoon on this page.

a project the Mayor did not like and could not
attack on any rational ground. , '

and it would have been a dandy. Unfortunately.
drawing is one of the few things I do badly, -and
none of our cartoonists rose to the bait, so we'll
have to do without it. A pity. It would have
shown the gaping excavation in front or (behind?)
the Student Union with a bunch of idle workmen
around it. In the foreground would be a foreman.

-explaining "We had to quit. About eight feet

down we hit a paper street.",,, '

Another cartoon which will not appear would
have shown a student sneering at a Meter Maid
“You can’t get me. It’s a paper car and I parked
it on Girts Way.” It seems a pity you will never
know about these cartoons.

The only reason I have devoted so much of
my limited energy to the subject of paper streets
is that I have been completely unable to under-
stand the recent difference of opinion between
the University and the City on the‘ subject of
the vacation of streets which exist only on some
moldy surveyors chart. These are thorofares
which‘ are not and have not been in public‘ use in
living memory. Some have never been in general

' use. but were private driveways. Others never did

exist in a paved condition. but were only inform-
al notes on somebody’s chart of a good place to put
a street if anyone happened to want one.

Long before construction of the Law School-

was threatened. the device of paper streets was
used to hold up part of the Skybus, Patwa_v project.

The Girts Way dispute is different, however.
The fact that it is.a dispute might suggest to the
ignorant that the two parties to the dispute are sep-
arate and independent. They are not; they are as-‘
pects of -one man.

Peter F. Flahert_v.- the Mayor of Pittsburgh.

is also. ex officio, a trustee of the University of
Pittsburgh. I have no doubt in my mind that Mr.

Flaherty discharges the responsibilities of his"

Trusteeship as diligently as he exercises his May-
oralty. A project as large‘ as the erection of the
Law School must have been discussed by the
Trustees; as a responsible man. the Mayor must
have been present; still. there is no record of his
saying “Halt! "There(is an obstacle; one of my
paper streets is on the very site you are choos-
ing!"

\

There is no record of his having said anything I

about the matter until construction as well under
way. This is curious behaviour on the part of a
member of the University Community. I have
tried to ask him about this. but he does not ans-
wer his phone. ’ '

I have been told that it is poor taste to mention
my cat in this column, and worse taste to use
this space for advertising. Forthese reasons, I
am unable to tell you that my Manx (tailless) cat
is available for adoption. Too bad. ‘ -

eLETTER

   

To THE EDITcJIa

 " (Editor. The Pitt News:

' I The Shah of Iran is making an-
other visit to the United States. In
everyvisit to the U.S. the Shah

s ’ has. among other things, aimed to
" persuade the American public
that he is_ the "benevolent mon-
arch" of a progressive and free
, country. According to him. Iran
 is an “Island pf Stability" in the
;_ Middle East and is making unpar-
 -allelled economic progress.

. " _ However, let us note some char-
acteristic facts about the country
 and the Shah's 32-year-old rule.
 up over it:
‘ . ’_—_72 per cent of all living quarters
' in Iran are made of straw or’
mud.

3-41 per cent of all families‘ of five ‘
or more live in single room

I dwellings.

-75 per cent of houses have no
electricity and 85 per cent no
water.

—There are less than 8.000 phy-
sicians in Iran for a population
of 30 million. ’

—About a third of all children die
before the age of five. '

—Average life expectancy is about
38 years (all according to gov-
ernment and western sources».

——Strikes are illegal and police
freely gun down the strikers. In
1965 an AFL-CIO observer re-
ported “persecution. imprison-
ment. exile. or perhaps “mere-
ly” dismissal and black listing

. is the characteristic treat-
ment of any worker trying to
assert his dignity in Iran to-
day." , A

Clearly. when such miserable _

living conditions prevail. strug-
gle becomes inevitable. And as
clearly. when there is’ struggle on
the part‘ of the people to better
their lot. there is repression on
the part of the government to put
them down. The more the strug-
gle. the greater the repression.

Let us note some more character- I

istic facts:
——Shah has a 200.000-man Amer-

ican trained army and a se-
cret police force of 60.000.

——The government budget for Min-
istry_of War (i.e. war against
the people) in the period 1963-
1971 has been six times that of
the budget for Ministry of
Health and three times that for
Ministry of Education.

—There are more than 30.000
political prisoners in Shah's
dungeons. ‘ I

--In the last two years alone.
more than 128 political dissi-
dents have been executed by fir-
ing squadsor otherwise mur-
dered by the police (most of
them students, engineers and
other professionals i.

—To top the earlier billions of
dollars of U.S. military aid to
Iran. that is U.S. taxpayers'
money that goes into perpetuat-
ing a fascist dictatorship. the
Pentagon has just concluded a
$3 billion arms deal with the
Shah. the biggest deal in Penta-
gon's entire history.

These undeniable facts speak
more clearly than anything else
to. the realities of the Iranian sit-
uation. We must also remember
that the Shah has been given the
"honor" of gendarming the Per-

- sian Gulf. in which more than

two-thirds of world's known oil
reserves are located. in the in-
terest of international oil mono-
polists. The so—called "energy
crisis" propaganda in this coun-
try also has great bearings on this
fact.

When we remember all these
facts. then it becomes increasing-
ly clear that Iran is indeed a "free
country. albeit "free" from its
own people, and "free" to be
plundered by ‘local and interna-
tional gangsters.

The pondering persists

by DAVID WARE

“Any officer who intends to ini-
tiate criminal proceedings against
‘ owners and employees of an estab-
lished commercial motion picture
theater for the exhibition of an ob-
scene motion picture must person-
ally view the motion picture and
prepare a report, describing the
general content and plot of the mo-
tion picture, as well as the alleged-
ly obscene portions.”

—Special Order No. 2-67 to all
commanding officers in the
city of Pittsburgh
“ADULT XX MOVIES FIRST PGH.
SHOWING . . . UNBELIEVABLY
REAL . . . TRUlSM"
—Signs outside the
L'Amoure Theatre

On June 21 of this year. the Unit-
ed States Supreme Court deliver-
ed a 5-4 ruling which placed por-
nography restriction under the
control of state law enforcement.

Chief Justice Warren Burger
stated that "nothing in the First.
Amendment requires that a jury
must consider hypothetical and
inascertainable ‘national stan-
dards' when attempting to deter-
mine whether certain materials
are obscene."

The court reasoned that “It is
neither realistic nor constitution-
ally sound to read the First
Amendment as requiring that the
people of Maine or Mississippi ac-
cept public depiction of conduct
tolerable in Las Vegas or New
York City.”

Burgers statement contained
examples of what could be defined

as offensive. ‘The list included
“representations and descrip-
tions of ultimate sexual acts. nor-
mal or perverted. actual or sim-
ulated" and "representations and
descriptions of masturbation."

In response to the ruling. po-
lice in Orlando. Fla.. confiscated
Deep Throat, and a Caldwell. N.J..
councilman seized Andy Warhol's
Flesh and Lonesome Cowboys,
calling them an “affront to com-
munity standards."

Nonetheless, films in a number
of Liberty Ave. movie houses rep-
resent sex acts which are very
definitely ultimate, and last
week an Atelier Theater produc-
tion of Michael McClure’s play
The Beard ended with Jean Har-
lowe stimulating herself in front
of the bewildered and disappoint-
ed Billy the Kid.

In an attempt to discover wheth-
er the people of Pittsburgh accept
public depiction of conduct found
tolerable in Las Vegas or New
York City. I contacted several of
the adult film theaters that line
Liberty Ave.

Some of the theaters were not
very receptive to my inquiry. The
Art Cinema refused to grant an
interview. The manager of the
Penthouse Theatre stated simply
that the Supreme Court's ruling
has had “no effect" on business
and would not give his name over
the phone.

“They’re scared,” was the hy-
pothesis given by L’Amoure The-
ater manager Fred Young’ when
I told him about the inhospitality
of his competitors.

“They're probably worried. I'm
not. because I know I'm not doing
anything wrong. I'm not hurting
anybody." he said.

When asked whether he felt
threatened by the new ruling. he
replied. “Not yet."

“Why not yet?”

“Because it may change. It de-
pends on the politicians who are
in power. Some politicians will
just do their work according to
the law. Others will get pressure
from somebody with enough mon-
ey and then they'll start crack-
ing down on pornography regard-
less of whether they care about it
or not." "L

Young stated that a hardening
of pornography laws would be an
economic hypocrisy: "I paid $25
for a license for that sign out
there. I had to pay the city of
Pittsburgh for a license to run
this place. Nobody refuses the
tax dollars I pay from the mon-
ey I earn here. and they're are all
kinds of taxes in this country. It
seems to me the only reason there
isn't a tax on pussy is that no-
body's figured out how to install
meters down there."

According to Young, the prose-
cution expenses for a pornogra-
phy trial run close to $4,000. “It’s
a waste of money,” he said. “That
money could be going to reduce
the crime rate. People get all ex-
cited when they read an article
about a pronography bust but they
take it for granted when a news-
paper tells about someone being
caught with three or four thou-
sand dollars worth of heroin. The

city should worry about that sort
of thing first. Once they’ve clean-
ed up really dangerous crime they
can start worrying about harm-
less things like pornography.”

He views pornography laws as
an infringement upon the rights
of the individual: "It's nobody‘s
business except the patrons. It
the American people didn't like
pornography it wouldn't be a five
billion dollar a year industry. The
type who complain about porno-
graphy have never seen any. They
think my theater's full of devi-
ates. perverts. bums. and hobos.

“But look at the people coming
in. They're A wearing business
suits. They're judges and law-
yers and ministers and business-
men. Sometimes we get guys off
the farm who just come once to
see what a show's like. Some-
times we get Europeans. and
they're completely used to this
sort of thing."

Carol Coleman, L’Amore’s cash-
ier supported much of what young
had to say.

“The men behave themselves
very well. It's just like they were
watching a film in school. Some-
times we get a clown or a rowdy
but that can happen anywhere."

“There's nothing filthy about
what I'm doing." said Young.

"What is filthy is people being
napalmed or a kid in the black
ghetto with his rib cage showing
from hunger or somebody shov-
ing a needle into his arm. That's
pornography. And nobody's ever
come out of' here and gotten into
a car accident and killed some-
body because he was under the
influence of pornography."

Young felt that. the Supreme
Court was “just buck-passing.
They're scared to touch this stuff.
But I don't see how localizing it
will help. If people living next
door to each other can't agree
about things. how can an entire
city decide what's pornographic
and what isn't‘? If the city really
wants to decide. they should have
a ballot and let everyone vote. If
the voters are against pornogra-
phy. they can close all these

places."

are due to report to Oakland on August 24.for pic-.

' Details are yet very sketchy. but talk is abun-
dant about a basketball conference for Pitt——pos'si-
bly as soon as the 1975 season. The conference_ha's
no name. but it will be an Eastern group and would
include Penn State. Syracuse. West Virginia. Bos-
ton College. .Army. .\’ay‘y. and possibly Temple.
along with the Panthers. « , _ .

An immediate benefit to the member schools
would be a grananteed bid to the conference
champ in the annual NCAA basketball tournament.
Only Temple. which belongs to. the_ Middle ‘Atlantic

 Conference. would have to switch conferences’f._as

the other schools are all independents. ’

It is not known at this time

the claim that since he wasn't_

shouldn'tbe suspended. 4 H

Relying on a devasting bench
and top—notch pitching through-

League counterparts Tuesday by
a score of 7-1.

It was the tenth victory in ele--_
ven years -for the nationals. and
gave them a series edge of 25-18. .

_ Starting pitcher Jim "Catfish"

ball bounced off Hunter’s thumb.
and he was forced to leave the
game.-.

Ke‘n.H_olzman. an Oakland A‘s

managed to hold the Nationals
scoreless. ‘

The American league took a
brieflead in the second inning
when Amos Otis of the ghost Kan-

outstretched glo'v.e of Cincinnati
second’ baseman Joe Morgan,
scoring Reggie Jackson, who had
doubled high off the center field
wall. .

single to left that scored Morgan.

and the Ni. was ahead to stay.
tarter Rick Wise picked up the

win. allowing one run in two inn-

ings. while Blylevin was charged
with the loss. V

The American league could only
put one man on third for the re-
mainder of the game. Buddy Bell
of Cleveland. but he died there.

number one spot, and the Cubs
trail them by just half a game.

"Pennant Fever" is starting to
hit Pittsburgh again. Since the
Pirates were expected to run away
with the eastern flag. many fans
gave up quickly when -the Bucs
were floundering nine games out.

The recent acquisition of Dal
Maxvill from Oakland has been
‘a big factor in the Pirate charge.
Although not a heavy hitter.
Maxvill is one of the best‘ at
shortstop. and the number of dou-
ble plays are going up steadily.
as are the number of victories.

Maxvill _has played shortstop
every game since becominga Pir-
ate. and with Richie Hebner side-
lined with a slight injury. Gene
Alley has filled in quite well at
third. If the Pirates can keep up
their hitting. look for Bill Vir-

  20th Century American Women Poets

Accident of Gender

'2

by JOHN METCALFE
"RISING TIDES 20th century

' American Women Poets."

Pocket Books. $1.95.
The publication of this book is

‘an economic and social event,
- the book itself is art. I recom-

I ., mend it.

Publishers are businesspersons

’more often than the_y are artists.

1..

/ Euripides.

Just now there are pressures on
publishers to produce works by
women. or about women. or in-
tended exclusively for women. A
market exists. and nobody wants
to be the publisher found want-
ing. As an extreme example. the
publishers of RISING TIDES. the
Pocket Book people. have chosen
to select ‘four of their standard
editions tb select four ‘of their
standard editions of the plays of
all of which have

«women in their titles. and reis-

sue them as "Four Plays About

'. Women“.

Other] publishers and other
editors have been snatching up

.. anything which has even remote-

   

ly to do with the female gender
and printing it. I am pleased to
report that this is not the case
with RISING TIDES.

All of the poets in this book
are women; the selection of them
and of their particular works is
based at least partly on the acci-
dent of gender. With a few ex-
ceptions, though these poets
are included for being poets, not
for being women or for sharing
some peculiar ideology accessi-
ble only to certain women.

If you happen to own an an-
thology which ‘claims to present
American poetry of this century.
it is probably defective in not
offering the works of the women
in this collection. Some of them
will be there. of course. Gertrude
Stein. Marianne Moore. Muriel
Rukeyser. and good old Edna St.
Vincent Millay. but they will
be a small minority. Other names
will be absent altogether. like
Nancy Willard. or even Nikki

Giovanni. They are here.

I admit I had never heard of
many of these poets before I found

‘book are page after page of co-

pyright credits: most of them re-
flect original publication in the
most obscure of the few journals
which still print poetry. Very lit-
tle of this material first appeared
in the Atlantic orthe New York-
er; it managed to reach print
catch-as-catch-can; wherever un-
known poets were willing to ac-
cept the glow of finally being pub-
lished as a substitute for material
success. I
The work has survived, and I
applaud the power of the women’s
movements in making this book
more likely.

There is a political bias visi-
ble here: for instance. Marianne
Moore is represented only by a
poem about marriage. tending to-
ward the negative. This is fine.
but the‘ whole woman is not giv-
en. I miss the finest fan of the
game of baseball the old Dodgers
ever had. because she was that
as well. I also miss the artisan
of verse intended only to please-

without that.

The organization of the book
is another matter. It is sexist by
definition. as only women appear.
but it is agist as well. The autl1—
ors appear in approximate order
of their dates of birth. For those
of us who are old enough. this is
alarming; at some point the book
consists entirely of people who
were born after we were. and they
all have something to say. (This
is only true if you were born be-
fore 1950. i '

A few of the selections seem
to have been made with an eye
to the obvious message. This is
annoying. Most are not. The poets
here are home because they are
poets, not because they are wom-
en. The tired phrases of female
power, just as tired as the phras-
es of any narrow movement to.--
ward power, refresh by their ab-
sence. These are poets.

This book is very nearly as
good as the opinions printed on
its jacket. This is a rare event.
For this reason, I abandon my
preference for soft-back books.

‘PLAYING HOUSE is a story
of growth. of a personmoving

through perceptions of the world A

and so forth. It is almost picar-
esque. It will be compared to
Joyce‘s Ulysses and to a dozen
novels of growth and experience.
unfairly. It is neither a copy nor
a restatement of the existing lit-
€I‘atuI‘e; it is a thing in its own
way. It is good.

The woman of PLAYING HOUSE
is real. She is not just a new Syl-
via Plath. She follows her life.
and the reader must follow her.
She is herself. not a new expres-
sion of what has gone before.
and she deals with herself.

For the simple, the book is the
story of a destruction; humor sav-
es it. For me, it is the real life

of an imagined person. I will

not trifle with the details of her
life here. She will tell it better.
