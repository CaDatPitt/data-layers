Hoax
suspect 
sentenced

Gideon Bradshaw
News Editor

A federal district court in Western
Pennsylvania sentenced one of the
men charged with threatening Pitt
over the Internet to one year and one
day in prison on Tuesday.

In addition to the prison term, '

Alexander Waterland, who pleaded
guilty to conspiracy to commit ex-
tortion over the Internet, will also
undergo two years of supervised
release after his prison term.

According to an FBI affidavit,
Waterland — who worked as a com-
puter technician for Express Scripts
Inc., in Mason, Ohio, at the time —
and a colleague posted avideo April
26, 2012, to YouTube titled “Anony~
mous Message to the University of
Pittsburgh.” The video’s narrator
claimed to possess students’ ﬁnan-
cial and personal information and
also claimed to represent the “hack-
tivist” group, Anonymous.

In the video, a digitized voice de-
mands that the Pitt administration
apologize to its students and faculty
for failing to protect students’ per-
sonal information. They also post-
ed a comment May 2, 2012, again
threatening to release students’
information if Pitt administrators
did not comply with their demands.

The comment also denied that
the user who posted the video was
responsible for the dozens of bomb
threats Pitt had received before the
posting of the comment, saying that
violence would violate the user’s
“rules of engagement.”

Ultimate Frisbee wins second straight championship

Jasper Wilson
Senior Stqff Writer

Trent Dillon looked at the disc,
which had just fallen to the ground,
put his head down and began to
sprint. .

A University of Central Florida

A back pass midway through Pitt’s

half had not found its target, and
resulted in a turnover. With no UCF
defenders back, Dillon had nothing

- but open space in front of him -
more than 50 yards of it.

Rising junior Marcus Ranii-
Dropcho picked up the disc and
hurled it forward through the air.

An opponent player gave chase
to the streaking opponent and the

high, curving projectile, but had no
chance: score, Pittsburgh.

“Speed kills,” second year-
head coach Nick Kaczmarek said
on Tuesday. “Speed just killed in
that game.”

On Monday, Pitt men’s ultimate
team, En Sabah Nur, repeated as
national champions with a 15-8
triumph over the Dogs of War. They
are only the ﬁfth team to do so in
the sport’s history.

Isaac Saul, a graduating senior
and key cog in the ultimate lineup
talked about conditioning being
the driving factor for repeat titles.

“There’s no doubt in my mind
we were in better shape than every-
one we faced,” Saul said. “Everyone

in general felt that they were in
better shape for this year’s nation-
als than last years which is saying a
lot because we put in a lot of work
last year too.”

For a team that lost three start-
ers from last year’s team, players
knew the task wouldn’t be easy,
according to rising senior and tri-
captain Aaron Watson.

“We knew at the beginning of
the season that one of the toughest
things todo in sports is to repeat
and it would require a ton of fo-
cus and dedication from the entire
team and our coaching staff,” Wat-
son said. “And the result validated
all those efforts.”

Pitt 15, UCF 8

Watson described a scene early
on in the contest following a Pitt
score that showed the differing lev-
els of conditioning between teams
and foreshadowed how the game
would unfold.

“They had their hands on their
hips and were standing there
catching their breath and walk-
ing real slow to the line, just visibly
dejected and worn down,” Watson
said of UCF.

Nationals is one of the few four-
day college tournaments, so being
in shape is vital to a team’s success.

“We set the goal at the begin-
ning of the year to be the ﬁttest

They also emailed Pitt police and adminis-
trators May 14, 2012, claiming that Pitt had a
week to comply with their demands.

“We are the students and faculty of Pitt!” the
email said. “We are your worst nightmare! The
intemet is here! You will now Expect [sic] us!”

Assistant U.S. Attorneyjames Kitchen, who
prosecuted the case for the federal govern-
ment, said the U.S. Attorneys’ Ofﬁce asked that
Waterland be sentenced to between 18 and 24
months in prison, which is consistent with
federal sentencing guidelines for the offense.

Kitchen said that Waterland’s defense coun-
sel requestedlthe judge sentence Waterland
to probation. V »

Anthony Bittner, who served as defense
counsel for Waterland, could not be reached
for comment.

Brett Hudson, Waterland’s former co -work-
er who allegedly suggested to Waterland that
the pair target Pitt, is scheduled to appear in
courtjune 18. According to court documents,
Hudson is pleading guilty to a charge of con-
spiracy.

Adam Stuart Busby, the Scottish nationalist
who is charged with 35 counts of fraud, trans-
mitting false information and international
extortion in relation to the bomb threats Pitt
received in the spring of last year, is currently
awaiting extradition from Ireland. I

F or The Pitt News

Residing north of Pittsburgh,
Shaler Township has inadequately
utilized the vast amounts of rock
that lie underneath its land, con-
trary to the suggestion of its name.
Although this township hasn’t
honored these massive sheets
of stone, which stretch beneath
much of Pennsylvania, shale is
still enjoying the bit of spotlight
and subsequent controversy it has
garnered in other states. This at-
tention stems from access to what
this rock has held for thousands of
years thanks to a new technology:
fracking.

As it stands, fracking has be-
come a technology with repercus-
sions and moral implications that
have evoked high-minded theories
similar to those of intellectuals
from the time of nuclear ﬁssion’s
invention. Where nuclear ﬁssion

presented the dilemma of abun-
dant electrical power versus the
potential for the same technology

- US. Energy information

to be used as a powerfully destruc-
tive force, fracking, in a less-dra-
matic sense, has presented its own
predicaments. ,

Although it might seem far-
fetched, fracking and its future
consequences have almost reached
identical levels of speculation. On
one hand, fracking is viewed as a
technology that has the power to
free us from the bonds of foreign
oil and ﬁnancial debt. On the other
hand, it’s also viewed as a tech-
nology that’s sure to ushergin a
dystopian future devoid of nature
and ﬁlled with pollution. Although
these are extremes, there is one
undoubtable truth: While people
know a lot about the potential im-
pact of fracking, they know little
about the technological process.

Originally developed in the
‘8os, fracking presented a new
alternative to drilling. Simply put,
fracking, or, more speciﬁcally, hy-
draulic fracturing, is the process
of pumping pressurized water in
to expand existing rock ﬁssures,
resulting in the expulsion of either

petroleum or natural gas. Frack-
ing can access these resources
more quickly, efficiently and from
deeper within the earth’s surface
than drilling.

Fracking, although a simple
concept mechanically, isn’t as
clearly innocuous or harmful as
either political side would like to
claim. In essence, there are two
camps: the conservatives who at-
tempt to ignore or dismiss those
possible dangers of the technology
and the liberals who are quick to
jump to conclusions before evi-
dence is solidiﬁed, resulting in
potential overstatements of real
dangers. However, when taking a
look at the facts gathered over the
years, it becomes apparent that
despite the evident beneﬁts of

vfracking, it does have its pitfalls.

At ﬁrst glance, fracking might
seem like a win for both political
parties. The advantages of natu-
ral gas are clear. At their core, oil
and natural gas are essentially no

different: Both are hydrocarbons, a chemi-
cal compound that can be used as a fairly
efﬁcient source of energy, and both can be
used in similar ways.

Second, the environmentalist can take
solace in the fact that natural gas, in effect,
ﬂoats out of these ﬁssures. No need to worry
about nasty oil spills, as natural gas simply
dissipates into the atmosphere.

Third and foremost, in the minds of
conservatives, fracking provides a solution
to the problem of discovering a source of
domestic energy, thus, lowering American
dependence on oil from less-than~cooper-

ative countries. In fact, it’s not true that
Middle Eastern soil is actually wealthier
in hydrocarbons, but rather, that those
hydrocarbons are typically liquid — i.e.,
petroleum —— and more readily accessible.
Fracking seems like a way to easily level the
playing ﬁeld.
So what are the drawbacks?

, Well, the ﬁrst issue is the water and
the fact that it isn’t just water that’s being
pumped into the ground during this pro-
cess. Fracking uses water that is chemically
treated to make the process more eﬁicient.
So what chemicals — in these millions of
gallons of water — are being pumped into
the earth? Well, therein lies the problem:
Most people don’t know. Many companies

aren’t required by law to disclose what
chemical additives they use for fracking.
This knowledge is considered “trade se-
crets” and property of the company. What
chemicals we do know are often ones such as
benzene and methanol, and there has been
recent evidence of water being polluted with
these chemicals near fracking locations.
Other concerns regard the correlations
between fracking and increased earth-
quakes as well as the ever-elusive issue of
global warming, which could increase in
severity as a result of the release of methane
gas into the atmosphere during fracking.
Now, considering these facts, Three
Mile Island comes to mind, with memo-
ries of a young, cleaner and more efficient

energy technology’s disaster, which had
a huge impact on the progress of Ameri-
can nuclear power. As a result, the United
States has been frozen, waiting decades
for a new nuclear power, plant: an energy
source proven to be cleaner and more ef-
ﬁcient than natural gas.

If the past were to repeat itself, it
would seem wise to halt fracking until it
has proven itself safe and reliable and turn
our sights on utilizing this other, already
reﬁned, clean and efficient power source.
A stretch? France has never had a nuclear
meltdown and actually produces enough
power through their nuclear powerplants
to export electricity. I

Anti-F|ag’s Chris No. 2 talks about Pittsburgh, punk and its future

John Lavanga
Impulse Editor

Perhaps one ofthe most outspoken punk bands
of the Bush era, Pittsburgh’s own Anti—Flag
became notorious for its raucous live shows,
short, driving songs and the unyielding rage it
expressed during the Iraq War.

Now, with two wars winding down, punk
bands such as Anti—Flag face a different politi-
cal climate. On Thursday and Friday, Anti—Flag
will join Mr. Small’s Theatre in celebrating its

10th anniversary as avenue. But more recently,
Anti—Flag bass player Chris Barker spoke to The
Pitt News by phone about the state of punk and
of the band itself.

The Pitt News: Punk is sort of a nebulous
termwithalot of different deﬁnitionsforalot of
different people. What does punk mean to you?

ChrissBarker: I believe that the deﬁnition
from its inception until now has changed many
times. For me, punk rock is all about realizing
that people in this world are often in a place
where they feel alienated and feel like they

can’t be themselves. Punk rock shows and the
punk rock scene has always given me a place
where it doesn’t matter what you look like, it
doesn’t matter what the color of your skin is,
it doesn’t matter if you’re straight or gay ——
you’re welcome.
TPN: While growing up, where did you ﬁnd
punk in the city of Pittsburgh?
CB: We had tremendous forefathers in punk
inthe city ofPittsburgh, with bands like The Bad
Jeans. Then probably the most internationally
known punk band to come out of Pittsburgh

was Aus—Rotten, and both of those bands were
doing it before Anti—Flag was.

Also the fact that Pittsburgh was such a
working—class town, all of us had someone who
worked at a steel mill in Pittsburgh, and we saw
when they closed all the steel mills down and
opted for the cheaper overseas steel. We saw the
direct impact that corporate greed had on our
city. I think that’s what kind of politicized the
city and, in turn, politicized the music scene.

SNL must showcase female cast’s
talent in order to succeed

Sophia Al Rasheed
For The Pitt News

The season ﬁnale of Saturday Night Live that
aired May 18 was bittersweet for several fans.
Avid followers had to part with not only one,
but two favorite cast members: Bill Hader,
who it seems won our hearts just yesterday
with his unforgettable “Stefon” persona; and

. Fred Armisen, the only cast member versa-

tile enough to feed audiencesthe ﬁrst Barack
Obama spoofs and to ﬂawlessly impersonate
Ira Glass.

In hindsight, the end for these actors
should not have come as much of a surprise
—~ SNL tends to emphasize exiting cast mem-
bers in the weeks leading up to their dramatic
ﬁnales, as we saw last year with Kristen Wiig.
An issue that rose from the show’s tactic this
year, however, is that while both Hader and
Armisen left with the praise they deserved,
the writers did little to broadcast the talents
of other, lesser-known cast members. The
transition from the familiar faces to the new
— who, incidentally, are not so “new” at this
point — has usually been buffered by the in-
corporation ofboth types of members in skits,

allowing for audiences to warm up to the faces -

they will see in upcoming seasons. Season 38
of SNL did not provide us with this buffer, and
we can expect quite an awkward transition for
the following season. .

This might not seem like a pressing issue.
After all, it would take a lot to deter the loyal
SNL fanbase from its beloved show, and fans
have dealt with awkward transitions before.
But because the show placed so much em-
phasis on female cast members — such as
Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant and Cecily Strong
— in the recent hiring process, there is quite
a bit at stake for the reputation of female com-
edy. While the initial “Bridesmaids”—inspired
agenda of hiring the actresses was a start to
highlighting female talent, the manner, in
which they carried these hirings out over the
course of the season left much to be desired.

Since screenwriters preoccupied them-
selves with showcasing the talents of the male
leads who would soon leave, female actors
were left to portray stereotypical “female”
personas, such as former porn stars turned
infomercial spokeswomen or girls at a middle
school slumber party talk show. It also didn’t
help that the week’s host normally served as
the focal point of the skit itself. Regardless
of whether the skits themselves generated
laughter — they usually didn’t — they did
nothing to prove that women can step outside
of typical character boundaries and be funny
simply because they are ﬁinny — the reason
that SNL alumni such as Hader and Armisen
became so loved in the ﬁrst place.

If SNL writers hope to showcase the talents
of female cast members, that is, display that
they are naturally funny, they should treat

L veens ch as se ig hie
when given nuanced roles. MC-T Campus

their skits the same way they treated the skits
of other SNL favorites. The cast members that
we grew to love did not garner such admira-
tion by ﬁtting into the molds of characters and
skits that were carved out for them or for their
gender. Instead, they received enough air time
to allow their personalities and their humor to
break through the characters they embodied.

Interestingly enough, this is afeat that SNL
actually accomplished in previous seasons, as
past female favorites indicate. Rachel match,
for instance, received the simple persona of
“Debbie Downer” —— someone who never
fails to add bad news to a conversation. The
skit wasn’t successful because screenwriters
felt that it would broadcast her potential as
a female cast member, it simply showcased
Dratch’s natural humor, namely, the side srnirk—

frown, which followed. her “downer” lines. _

Kristen Wiig’s “Target Lady” skit followed a
similar technique. It was funny because it exag-
gerated the believable concept of someone who
just loves Target (If you’ve seen the excitement
of some Target customers, this skit isn’t that
far from the truth). Screenwriters likely did
not anticipate Wiig’s pronounced lower-jaw
voice and slightly backward—inclined posture,
which characterized the persona. But no one
could have.

It’s difficult to part with any cast member
of SNL because, unlike most other television
shows, SNL gives us real personalities on
screen with which we can build a relation-
ship. We’ve had the pleasure of seeing both
Hader and Armisen fearlessly putan incredible
amount of themselves into their performances,

_ and their shoes will prove very difficult to ﬁll.

But hopefully ﬁiture SNL writing will once
again allow for that to happen.

ANTI-FLAG

TPN: What’s your band’s relationship with
the city of Pittsburgh now?

CB: It’s interesting because much like all over
North America, punk rock has kind of receded
back into a much smaller subgenre of music
than maybe it was in 2006 or 2007. For us, in
Pittsburgh on this tour We’re gonna play a500-
cap venue, and it’s one that we have close ties to.
It’s called Mr. Small’s Theatre, and we actually
recorded The Terror State in that theater.

It’s not like in Pittsburgh we play to 10,000
people or anything. We do the same in Pitts-
burgh as we do anywhere else. We’re not home-
town heroes, but tl1at’s OK. We like it that way.
We like to just play our shows there and be with
the kids that like our band and like punk rock
and are part of our community.

TPN: What do you think is the cause of punk
rock’s popularity falling off?

CB: I think that punk rock is apolitical agen— '

da, and I feel like with all the effort that went
into the anti-war movement and the anti-Bush
movement that when Barack Obama was elected
we all breathed a collective sigh of relief like,
“Oh, that’s over.”

We felt like we had accomplished some
semblance of a goal. In that, I think it’s kind
of made it easier for people to say, “OK, I need
something different.”

Music is cyclical. Being in a band for 20
years, you get to see 1996 when punk rock isn’t
really happening at all. Then, all of a sudden,
it turns into this huge thing. Then it goes back
down again. E

I just know that we know how to survive
through all of those things. We know how to
put out and record our own records. We know
how to book our own shows and play to venues
that the kids that like punk rock want to be a
part of, so we’re gonna survive whether it’s hit
a high point or a low point. I

as  Pair of losses’ to Notre Dame
ends Panthers’ season

Nate Barnes
Assistant Sports Editor

Pittbaseball enjoyed arguably its best
season in program history in 2013.

But the accomplishments of Pitt’s
ﬁrst 40-win season and the team’s
multiple selections to All-Big East
teams couldn’t help the Panthers (42-
17) this weekend, when two losses to
Notre Dame bounced them out of the
Big East tournament.

The second loss to the Irish — a

tively ended the Panthers’ season,
as Monday’s selection proceedings
for the NCAA tournament omitted a
Pitt team that was ranked in all ﬁve
national polls just two weeks ago.
Game 1: Pitt 10, St.]ohn’s 2
In the Big East toumament’s ﬁrst
game, No. 3—seeded Pitt trounced St.
John’s as it had earlier in the season.
At Bright House Field in Clearwater,
Fla., not even a rain delay could stop

runs on four hits.

The pitcher for the Red Storm,
senior Sean Hagan, did not make it
past the ﬁfth inning as the Panthers
scored seven runs oifSt.]ohn’s starter
on seven hits. Pitt scored four in the
third, and, after St._]ohn’s scored two
in the fourth to pull within two runs,
Pitt tacked on three more in the ﬁfth
to put the game out of St.John’s reach.

Sophomore Elvin Soto, junior
Steven Shelinsky and seniors Evan
Oswald and Ronald Sucre led the Pan-
ther offense, each battingintwo runs.

“We needed to win that ﬁrst ball
game, and I thought that we played
good, hard baseball,” Pitt head coach
Joe Jordano said. “We came up with

position, and Ethan pitched out-
standing.” .
Game 2: Notre Dame 5, Pitt 3
The Pitt offense proved unable
to any its strong performance into
3 round two as Notre Dame’s sopho-
more starting pitcher, Pat Connaugh-
ton, allowed just three runs on nine
hits over six innings. Then, manager
MikAoki handedthe balltofreshman
Nick McCarty and junior Dan Slania,
who combined to pitchthree shutout
innings and close the door on Pitt’s
chances to win its second game of
the tournament.

junior Ethan Mildren from pitching ,

“We did not play clean baseball
today, and that ended up hurting us,”
Jordano said. “Give credit to Notre
Dame. They came up with some big
hits with runners in scoring position,
and they pitched well, and that was
the difference.”

- Pitt ended up leaving nine men on
base Thursday and, ultimately, lost by
two runs. Pitt trailed by a single run
for most of the game and certainly
had opportunities to take the lead.

Notre Dame struck ﬁrst for four
runs off Pitt starting pitcher junior
Matt Wotherspoon in the ﬁrst four
innings, with two runs coming in
the second inning and two more in
the fourth.

Trailing 4-0, Pitt showed some
life in the top of the ﬁfth. Junior
outﬁelder Casey Roche delivered a
two—RBI single, and seniorthirdbase—
man Sam Parente brought in another

, runwith an RBI single of his own. At

the end of the inning, Pitt cut Notre
Dame’s lead to a single run, 4-3.

But from there, the Panthers
failed to score over the ﬁnal four at
bats. Notre Dame tacked a run onto
its lead in the ﬁfth to go up 5-3, and
Pitt recorded just one hit overthe last
four innings.

Game 3: Pitt 7. Seton Hall 6

In a matchup of the No. 2 and
No. 3 seeds in the tournament, Pitt
outlasted Seton Hall over 12 innings
and notched a comeback victory on
a two-out, RBI double by third base-
man Sucre to stave off elimination.

Pitt trailed for most of the after-
noon, with Seton Hall leading the
Panthers 5-1 after ﬁve innings.

'0n the brink of elimination, the
Panthers ﬁnally showed some life,
scoring two runs in the sixth inning
to pull within two runs of the lead, 5-3.
Seton Hall scored another run in the
top of the sevent.h,’but the Panthers
rallied soon after.

Back-to-back singleswith one out
by Soto, and sophomore outﬁelder
Boo Vazquez put men on ﬁrst and

second for the captain and senior
leader, Parente, whose double scored
two runs and brought Pitt within one
run. Parente then scoredﬁom second

team in the country,” Watson
said. “So we planned on being
the ﬁtter team.”

Never trailing in the game,
Pitt ﬁnished with its best margin
of victory of the event.

“I think our conditioning
program had a lot to‘ do with
that,” Watson said. “Nationals
is just more taxing on the body
and we’ve been to Nationals the
last nine years, so we know how
tough and grueling that is and we
spent the whole year training to
prepare for the energy that that’s
gonna require.” '

Kaczmarek added that the
team got better as the weekend
went on, making its ﬁnal per-
formance its best a sentiment
graduating senior Isaac Saul
echoed.

“The most important thing of
the tournament was that we got
better every game and played
the best tournament we played
all year, and did it at the right
time, ” Saul said.

Pitt needed to impose itself
on UCF early to have success.

“We thought [UCF] was going
to be a very reactionary team and
were gonna have trouble dictat-
ing as long as we went out and
dictated offensively, as long we
really tried to control the pace
of game and we were aggressive
with our speed,” Kaczmarek
said. “And that’s what we were

The Ultimate Frisbee team celebrates after winning the national title.

and I think that certainly showed
in the game.”

Pitt 14, Oregon 11

The UCF outcome stood in
stark contrast to a back and
forth semiﬁnal matchup with
second-seeded Oregon. Oregon
jumped out to an early lead,
bringing something said by as-
sistant coach Ari Weitzman be-
fore another tournament game
to fruition.

“In each game we feel we’re
really well prepared, so it’s just
a matter of that we can wake
ourselves up or will there have
to be something that wakes us
up,” he said. ,

The latter proved true in this
case.

But Pitt, the first team to
eight, went into halftime up by
a score and wouldn’t surrender
control.

‘The Panthers had their hands
full throughout the game though.
Oregon had a capable and even-
ly-matched squad that, like Pitt,
depended on its speed. It includ-
ed junior Dylan Freechild, this
year’s recipient of the Callahan
Award, . ultimate’s equivalent of
the Heisman in college football.

usual mistakes resulting in turn-
overs. V

“He’s such a great player, if
youlet him just throw whatever
he wants all game, he’s gonna
nail it,” Kaczmarek said.

This attitude held true for
the rest of Ego, as the squad is
known, and the result was the
same.

“We wanted to make them
make the most difficult throws
possible and, if you watch that
game, Dylan had some‘unchar-
acteristic turns [turnovers] and
I think we hopefully we frus-
trated him to the point that he
was taking shots that weren’t the
easiest shots and if we can gener-

ate those turns that way that’s _
great,” Kaczmarek said. “And

that’s exactly what happened.”

winning point of the champion-

“I feel like this is something

Nkanata among five headed
to National Championships

Dan Sostek
Staff Wrz'ter

This past Saturday, the Pitt men’s track and ﬁeld
team competed at the NCAA East Regionals
in Greensboro, N.C., with an opportunity for
athletes to earn berths to the NCAA National
Championships in Eugene, Ore., which tak
placejune 5-8. V ‘
Highlighting the competition was Pitt junior
sprinter Carvin Nkanata. N kanata, a transfer
from Iowa Central Community College, placed
sixth in the 200-meter dash and is a member
of ‘the 4x400 relay team that also qualiﬁed to
compete at the NCAA nationals. '

Nkanata’s career-best time in the 200—meter a

dash is 20.32 seconds, which he recorded two
weeksago at the ECAC—IC4A championships. At

a the time, itwas the second-fastest in the nation.

The Pitt News had a chance to talk with the
rising star of the Pitt track and ﬁeld squad as
he prepares forthe ﬁnal race of his junior year.

The Pitt News: You have a very interesting
story regarding how you ended up at Pitt, as
head coach Alonzo Webb ﬁrst saw you in a
You'I‘ube video. What were some of the reasons
that you decided to enroll at the University of
Pittsburgh?

Carvin Nkanata: There were a couple of
deciding factors. One was the location, as I’ve
got family up there. I also really enjoyed my
relationship with the team. They’re all really
good guys. Also, the academics were a big de-
ciding factor as well. Pitt is known for being a
good school academically, and that’s always
important.

TPN: webb' said that after the NCAA East
Regional meet Saturday, you were not 100 per-
cent healthy. What was bothering you? Did it
affect you at all during the race‘?

A CN: I had a little sickness going on before
I ran that day. I ran as hard as I could. I put on
for my team and did the best thatl could so that
we could get to nationals, and we succeeded.

TPN: You competed in front of your parents
for the ﬁrst time in your college career Saturday.
How much of that was on your mind during
the meet?

CN: It was on my mind pretty much the
whole meet. I wanted to qualify for nationals,
and we did that. But with them being there, I
also wanted to make my family proud.

TPN: Going into the NCAA championships,
you are going to be one of the favorites to win

Edz't0r—z'n-C/my”

This isn’t the Pittsburgh Pirates team that I
have come to know.

The team I’ve followed for the last 10 years
wouldn’t have ﬁve capable starting pitchers, at
least two impact bats and a front office willing
to make the decisions necessary to win.

In fact, the team I’ve painfully — and some-
times regrettably — followed wouldn’t have
sniffed ﬁrst place in the National League’s Cen-
tral Division. It’d be ﬁghting for fourth place
with the lowly Chicago Cubs as the St. Louis
Cardinals buried them on the scoreboard and
in the standings.

No, the team I’ve watched this year has
something that Pirates teams have lacked
since 1992: the willingness to put it all on the
line for a win.

And fans can attribute this attitude to the
team’s manager, Clint Hurdle.

Take, for instance, Sunday’s matchup
against the defending American League
champion, the Detroit Tigers. Facing peren-
nial all—star hurlerjustin Verlander, the Pirates
encountered a loss excusable under most ac-
counts. Verlander entered as arguably the most

dominant pitcher in interleague play, holding
a career 20-2 record, and the Pirates had just
taken two out of three games against the Mil-
waukee Brewers at Miller Park, a location that
has haunted the Pirates for years now.

This time, the battlin’ Buccos didn’t plan
on making excuses. Though they eventually
lost 6-5, the Pirates scored three runs on seven
hits off Verlander -- an accomplishment in
and of itself. But it’s the manner and timing in
which they scored these runs, and the runs after
Verlander exited the game, thatare worthy of
a second look.

Twice during the ballgame the Pirates fell
behind by three runs, and twice they battled
back, bringing the deﬁcit within one in the top
of the seventh inning (4-3) and top of the eighth
(6-5). If it weren’t forabaserunning blunder by

utility man Josh Harrison, the Pirates might‘

have tied it up in the eighth.
Clearly, something is happening here.
Whether it’s center ﬁelder Andrew Mc-
Cutchen’s “BUCN” (Buc Nation) hashtag on
Twitter, or the Zoltan sign the players make
when they execute a crucial play, it’s clear that
the Pirates have found an identity that has re-

the 200—meter dash. Do you pay any attention
to these expectations?

CN: I don’t really pay attention to them. I

just try to focus on running fast and working
as hard as I possibly can. If the time’s going to.
come, it’s goingto come when it needs to come.

TPN: How are you planning on preparing for
your ﬁrst trip to the NCAA nationals in Oregon?

CN: 1 am going to keep doingwhat I’ve been
doing, working hard at practice, just continuing
with my routine, and hopeﬁilly I’ll be able to
succeed at nationals like I know I can.

TPN: How have you made such a big leap
from competing in junior college to becoming
one of the best runners in the nation?

CN: I told myselfwhen I got out of junior
college, where I didn’t have a great sophomore
season, “When I get to Pitt, Iwant to be one of

the best runners in the nation.” I just want to
keep improving and keep getting better, and,
so far, that’s what I’ve done. '

TPN: Who have been some of the largest
inﬂuences in helping you adjust so well to a new
environment at the University of Pittsburgh?

CN: Coach Webb has been really great in
terms of letting me feel welcome. My team-
mates and family have been really great. It has
made it feel like ahome away from home for me.

TPN: Are you planning on continuing your
running career after college? Do you have the
Olympics on your radar?

CN: That’s deﬁnitely one of the things on my
radar. I’m going to try to get there. I’m going to
keep working hard and, hopefully, after college,
try to get a pro career. I,

mained elusive for years.

And havingan identity is atrend among the
successful Pirates of the past. Look at the “We
Are Fam—i-ly” squad of 1979, the last year the
team won the World Series, or the underdog

‘Pirates team that took down the powerhouse
New York Yankees at Forbes Field in Game 7
of the 1960 World Series with second baseman
Bill Mazeroski’s walk-offhome run.

So why does this change in identity matter?

It’s simple: The Pirates’ roster turnover has
plagued the team for two decades now.

Chemistry has been hard to come by, and,
as a result, so has winning. Having a team
identity promotes the “us against the world”
mentality that I fondly remember from my
years of high school sports.

The people around you aren’t simply your
teammates, they’re your brothers.

It’s pretty clear that Hurdle is the mas-
termind behind this transforrnation. In fact,
this new atmosphere has been evident since
he became manager about three years ago.

Though the team struggled during Hurdle’s

ﬁrst season, fans witnessed a new emphasis
on playing the game with tenacity and an at-
tention to detail from opening day forward.
Hurdle has espoused these ideals throughout
his career in baseball, emphasized by his suc-
cess in leading the Colorado Rockies to the
2010 World Series.

But, of course, Hurdle would be nowhere
without the players, and, for once, the Pirates
have a group that’s dedicated to improving
as individuals and as an organization. Mc-
Cutchen, second baseman Neil Walker and left
ﬁelder Starling Marte highlight a lineup that
displays a level ofhumility and dedication that
Pirates fans haven’t seen in quite some time.
They have graciously accepted the role as the
faces of the team and will hopefully remain as
such for a longtime.

After last season’s second—half meltdown,
I’m reluctant to make predictions. As a Pirates
fan, it’s unwise to set your expectations high
unless you’re someone whohas grown to enjoy
disappointment.

But, with that being said, there’s one mes-
sage baseball fans nationwide should embrace:
The success of this year’s Pirates team is not
a ﬂuke. I
