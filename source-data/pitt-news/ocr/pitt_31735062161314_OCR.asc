On Commons Room Dance

. Players Open

  Tomorrow Nite

“The Pitt Players production,
“Suspect,” will open tomorrow
‘night at 8:30 p. m. in the Stephen
Foster Memorial.

A reception for all ﬁrst nighters

will follow tomorrow’s perform-'
= ance in the‘ social room of the

memorial.

The psychological drama will be
" given Thursday through Saturday.

The play concerns the attempt
of a newspaper publisher to deter-
Vmine the guilt orcinnocence of a

Woman suspected of murdering
her father“ and step—mother with
an axe. ~

‘In the role of the publisher is
Melvin Silver;. Ruth Schwartz
plays the suspect.

A The woman’s son is portrayed
‘by James Hoobler.

V Two newcomers to Players, Je-
rome Meyer and Tom Piemme,
"have had acting experience in
high school and in other dramatic
“groups.

Others in the cast are Sue Del-
_ph~ey, Dolores Morgret and Doro-
thea Greninger.

Helping Harvey J. Pope, director
of Players, is Mary Malanga. She
‘K a lecturer in the speech depart-

ment of the University and has
directed a number of other shows.

Tickets are now on sale at the

Student Desk on the ground ﬂoor.
Single tickets sell for $1.00. Sub-
scription booklets of ‘ four tickets
may be purchased for the price of
three. All seats are reserved.

9 Student Congress prepared today to ﬁre its best shot

in its semester-long attempt to secure Commons Room danc-
ing. ‘

At a special meeting of the University Social committee
today, Bill McKinley, chairman of SC’s Commons Room com-

-mittee, will present a petition for permission to hold a Senior Grad-
uation Dance in the Commons one
June 8.

The petition advocates Commons
Room dancing on three counts.

First, it says, the Commons
Room h a s strong sentimental
value, and a dance there “would

be something that seniors would
always remember.”

Secondly, the letter states that

such a dance is “deﬁnitely feasi-
ble.” A plan has been drawn up
whereby such a dance could be
held at a cost of $142.

“In comparison with the $4010
rental fee for the Hotel Schenley,”
the letter says, “the above ex-
penses seem very small.”

Third, “Student Congress can
think of nothing that would pro-
mote school spirit and school loy-
alty any more than the establish-
ment of an annual, traditional
school dance such as the one now
being proposed.”

Apparently in answer to a state-.
ment made last week by Dean of
Men T. W. Biddle, the petition
goes on to say that Commons
dancing ‘‘would not in any way
militate against Student Union.”

“When facilities are not avail-
able”, the letter concludes, “we do
not mind substitutes, but when
facilities are available and yet are
not employed to the fullest ad-
vantages, we feel that the Univer-
sity is not doing justice‘ either to
itself or its students.”

Vets Get Warning

William F. Saalbach, director

status under the GI Bill.

" If the Vet does not heed the

warning or if the situation is not
adequately cleared up he will be
dropped from the University and
his VA beneﬁts stopped.
A Drastic Step
Saalbach admitted that this
was a rather drastic step.

“But in order to maintain the

standards set up by the VA,”

he said, “it must be carried
out.”

“Few students have been guilty
of this act,” Saalbach said, “but
last semester we had between 5
and 10 vets dismissed for viola-

According to the plan, one-third,

the rest of American society, ac-_
cording to Harold A, Goltz, as-7*

sistant director of student person-
nel at Macalester College.

“Unless we use the ‘group dy-
namics’ approach with campus
leaders in the practical laboratory
of student activities, we will not
afiefluately prepare our future
CIVIC leaders in the group process-
es they will face after graduation.

.‘‘A College group, given suffi-
-cient authority to fulfill its pur-
-pose, will usually demonstrate re-
sponsibility far above and beyond
what was expected of them a few
years ago.

If the colleges fail to channel
the energies and talents of stu-
dents_ into healthy educational
pursuits, these energies and’ tal-
ents will ﬁnd their reward in ac-

"i . Anyway, war hysteria has swept the campus, and the
"accompanying disintegration is well under way.
 ,_ Only it’s the administration that’s hysterical. The stu-
 dents, after the ﬁrst panicked rush to the recruiting office,
fihave settled down to await the expiration of their draft post-
ponements or are angling for jobs in essential industry.
" But the deans, the trustees, the registrar, the treasurer,
.and even the chancellor have given way to hysteria, pure
and simple.
‘ Enrollment and tuition will hit rock bottom, they’ve
decided, and isn’t it awful. Cancel the building program,
lay off the hired help, get ready to ﬁre a few hundred in-
.. structors, hold down faculty salaries, reduce the size of the

In other times, in’ other places, that is. Here at Pitt, the

and Invention-was stillborn.
Steps have been taken, of course. Model bills deferring
college students in ‘essential’ studies have been drafted and
sent to Congress. Chancellor Fitzgerald, we believe, was a
" prime mover in this effort, which may eventually do some
good after the worst harm has been done.

For the retrenchments go on, and the planners talk about
a student body of 3000 come next fall, while other schools
step up their recruiting programs (already far ahead of
‘Pitt’s) and drag in this J une’s crop of high school graduates,
,knowing that they’ll be able to salvage a good percentage
after the Selective Service swings the axe. In place of foot-

The cardplayers watched them.
Finally, there was an animated
group at the windows looking
out.

But everyone was getting on
famously. They were becoming
friends. An air of good will'per-
vaded the place.

But the air was as phony as the
smiles on the hostesses faces. Ev-
erything was forced. The profes-
sors tried their best to get on with
the troops, but you could see that
they were trying.

All they lacked up there was
a couple of kegs of beer with a
few pounds of pretels and potato
chips to go with it. Add a lot of
cigarette smoke‘ to this scene and
you would have had a real, rootin’
tootin’ party.

Maybe there would have been

a minor brawl or two. But they 
wouldn’t have amounted to much. 
If things got too rough for the 
profs, they could have sent some 
of their more energetic colleagues "3

But whatever beer did to the 
conclave, it would have been for 

the better. Can you think of any-

Signs of the times are plentiful these days. Take this one
for instance—Yesterday morning Pitt News photographer
Jack Warren glad-handed a friend of his he met walking one

“How are you?” chirped

him with a sad, sad look on his
face, “1-A.”

And California has again come
up with the unusual, this time an
optimistic man. Out in Los An-
geles Andrew T. Jergins has of-
fered to bet $100,000 that Russia
won’t attack the United States this
year. Furthermore he’ll. lay a
cool $200,000 straight down the
line that she won’t do it in 1952.

So if there are any Young Pro-
gressives left at Pitt who have a
hundred grand and an axe to
grind, here’s their chance.

We see that the latest defense

It will soon be time for Scholar’s
Day again, that dismal ceremonial
for a scattered hundred or so
spectators at Foster Memorial. In
the three years we have been at
Pitt it has been made clear to us
that merely dismissing classes for
an hour will not necessarily guar-
antee enough of an audience at the
Memorial to make the event
worthwhile. ‘

So we would like to advance the
suggestion that the traditional day
which honors the Universityfs rea-

new artiﬁcial rainmaking methods

Employment won’t be hard to

this year ,especially if one hap-

While the Panthers have been
working out under the Stadium
for the past two weeks, Coach
Ralph Mitterling has continued
his search for a capable pitc-hing
staff. -

Bob Russell is Mitterling’s sole
holdover. However, the Panther
coach has two hurlérs from last
year’s team who appear likely
prospects to join Russell on the
mound. .

Jim Markle, senior righthander
from Mount Lebanon and Elmer
‘Lefty’ Guckert, junior southpaw
from Oliver high, have been im-
pressive in early practice sessions.

“Mark1e and Guckert pitched
only a few innings for us last sea-

The Phi Eps didn’t have to wait
long to revenge their basketball

them in two straight games, 15-1

dethroned the Peps as IF basket-

When Baierl’s former team

600 Visitors Attend Open
House Display on 12th Floor

Over 600 visitors attended the combined Open House and ,
kitchen display which formally opened the kitchen on the : sic, playing accelerated rhythms
12th floor of the Cathedral Monday afternoon and evening.

The main interest in the Open House, which included a j
tour of the entire floor, was the kitchen and the display of

borrowed samples of furnishings.’
On display were sample table
settings, kitchenware, table linen
and silverware. “Starter” supplies?
of these have come from the H. J.
Heinz Company,_Pi Lambda Theta, j
the Zonta Club of _Pittsburgh, from 
Mrs. D. D. Lessenberry, and froml
Judge Sara Soffel. 3
Guests included coeds and their‘
mothers, wives of members of the
faculty, administration w 0 in e n,
graduate students, and members
of independent women’s groups on
campus and in Pittsburgh.
Donations to help with the costl
of furnishing the room were
dropped into miniature houses.
These houses will be set up on the
12th ﬂoor and in the Information
Room during the week to receive
any further contributions, accord-
ing to Marie Homisak, chairman
of the WSGA 12th floor committee.
Miss Homisak and her committee;
were in charge of the event.

Hadacol May Relieve cause of Troubles

B2, Nlacln and Iron, that Interfere with
Fun and Studies!

 

The marvelous beneﬁts of HADA—
COL, today's great nutritional
formula, are equally helpful to
young and old alike who are suffer-
ing from a lack of Vitamins B., B2,
Iron and Niacin.

Here’s what these two pretty
coeds, who may have been suﬂ'er-
ing from such deﬁciencies, have to
say: “We are two college students
writing you this letter. Before tak-
ing HADACOL we were nervous,
restless and unable to sleep at
night. We found we were foggy
all day and ached all over. Now

ACOL we are different persons.
We are full of life and energy and
our aches have completely disap-
peared. Thank you for your won-
derful discovery of that remarkable
product, HADACOL."

This is typical of thousands of
letters telling how HADACOL re-
lieves the real and basic cause of
deficiency distresses. For HADA-
COL provides more than the mini-
mum daily requirement of Vita-
mins B., B., Niacin and Iron, plus
helpful quantities of Phosphorus
and Calcium. It builds up the
hemoglobin content of the blood
(when Iron is needed) to send
these precious Vitamins and Min-
erals surging to every part of the

 

body and to every body organ.

Ra bbiSays We ’ve LostFaith In Life

“We have fallen out of love
with the world,’ Rabbi Solomon
B. Freehof said at the ﬁnal
meeting of the Religion-in-Life
conference, Thursday, March 8.
“We’re out of love not only with
the individual but I also fear we
are out of love with our native
land.”

Modern man has forgotten the
faith in the inborn decency of
human life, he said in his talk at
the Stephen Foster Memorial be-
fore students and guests of the
conference.

Modern View Pagan

We, the moderns, “view an
apocalyptic future of sudden ex-
plosion and death.” This modern
view, he added, is “psychologic-

ally dangerous and pagan. It is
pagan in the sense that it is anti-
religious.”

He then said it is our responsi-
bility, as Christians and Jews, to
recapture the f_ith of the Bible,
which says at the beginning of
Genesis, -“And God sa-w that ev-
erything that He has made, and
behold, it was good.”

“Religious sentiment,” said
Rabbi Freehof, “still lives as a

mood in America.” But he said
that we have lost the sense of this
mood.

Prophets Found Hope

The speaker continued, saying '

that every prophet of the Bible,
regardless of his own personal-
ity, found words of hope. “We no
longer have the prophetic faith
in the human decency of people,"
he said. We have lost faith in our
country.

With‘ silica, water and imagination
Du Pont scientists have found

How to Tame’ Slippery Floors

Teen-agersin high schools used to
have great, if hazardous, fun running
and sliding on newly waxed corridor
ﬂoors. Of late many of them haven’t
been able to do that. For numerous

schools, as well as oﬂice buildings

and institutions, are now using waxes
that have been made skid-resistant.

The product that is taming slip-
pery ﬂoors is “Ludox” colloidal silica
-—adapted by Du Pont chemists to
ﬂoor, wax through cooperative re-
search with the wax industry.

If you mix plain sand with ﬂoor
wax, you’ll have an anti-slip surface,
but it would be unsightly and thor-
oughly impractical. With “Ludox,”
you are using a water suspension of
invisible colloidal silica particles less
than a millionth of an inch in diam-
eter.

A problem child

“Ludox” was quite a problem child
to scientists who developed it. For
instance, research men had to know
how silica would act in the presence
of ﬂoor wax. So they turned to the
electron microscope and learned that
the little silica spheres attach them-
selves ﬁrmly to the surfaces of wax
spheres ﬁve times their size.

But it was also necessary to ﬁnd
out how “Ludox” affects a waxy ﬁlm

“Ludox“ particles (dark, in this electron photo-
micrograph) surround the larger wax partlcles

as well as safer. Other wax qualzttes—gloss,

after it is laid down on a ﬂoor. While
a polished waxed ﬂoor looks smooth
enough, it is actually a series of hills
and valleys and these irregularities
have an important bearing on the
behavior of a surface.

Working with a waxed surface pre-
sented difficulties. The electron mi-
croscope functions only if electron
beams can pass through the mem-
brane upon which the specimen is
placed. And electrons can’t "see
throug ” a ﬂoor!

Study in duplication
Often, problems like this have been
solved by preparing a thin replica or
copy of the surface for examination
in its stead. However, the conven-

tional method for making a replica-Hg

  

Cross-section of wax film shows how pressure

the one frequently used in studying
metals—requires solvents. These
would dissolve andruinawaxsurface.

So it became necessary for the
chemists and electron microscopists
to develop an entirely new ‘way to
make a replica of a surface. This they
did, as part of a research program
that lasted several years.

With it some remarkable pictures
were made. They showed that many
"Ludox” particles stay at the sur-
face of a wax ﬁlm, even though they
are denser than wax. As you walk on
a ﬂoor, your shoe presses the tiny
silica particles down into the wax

spheres that make up the ﬁlm. This ’

sets up a snubbin g action which keeps
you from slipping-

Much more could be told about
Du Pont research on colloidal silica.
For example, chemical and” mechan-
ical engineers had to develop manu-
facturing equipment, including a spe-
cially designed ion exchange column.
Organic and physical chemists used
research ﬁndings to formulate better
waxes, as well as silica-containing
adhesives and anti-slip treatments
for rayon fabrics. Like practically all
Du Pont achievements, “Ludox” is
the result of close, continuous team-
Work of men and women trained in
many ﬁelds of science.

it costs more than $10,000 on the average to
provide the tools, machines, factory space
and working capital for an American worker.
Du Pont’s average operating investment per
employee is $17,800.
