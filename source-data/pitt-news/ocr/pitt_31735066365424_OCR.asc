Anti-war

protest

set, in Cleveland’

This Saturday, 17 regional rallies are planned to reinforce op-
position sentiment to the Vietnam War and social injustice.

Sponsored by two national anti-war groups, National Peace Action

Coalition (NPAC) and People’s

Coalition for Peace and Justice

(PCPJ), the rally for students and non-students in the Ohio, Western
Pennsylvania, and West Virginia areas will take place at Cleveland.

Ohio.
Persons wishing to reserve a

seat on one of the five chartered

buses should contact the Peace and Freedom Center.

Paul LeBlanc, a senior History major and member of the Pitt
Chapter of the PCPJ, explained why he felt constant pressure should

be applied to national policymakers.

“Nixon’s ‘tenacious’ resistance to the Mansfield end-the-war-
amendment indicated that he is still considering the anti-war senti-
ment. With this in mind, we have to continue to mobilize rigorous op-
position, or the war won't end," he said.

Speakers representing_the Angela ~Davis Task Force, Welfare
Rights Organization, Clergy and Laymen Concerned, Penal Reform,
United Auto Workers, and two mayorality candidates from the Cleve-
land area will speak at Cleveland’s Public Square, which is located

near Cleveland State University;

The Nov. 6 rally is part of an ongoing program of opposition to the
war and the inequities of social justice. Last Oct. 13, the NPAC and
NCPJ organized local rallies and marches as antecedents to the forth-

coming regional gathering.

A national convention of anti-war components is planned" for early
December to serve as a forum for discussion of future direction of the

anti-war movement.

“It’s an ongoing process of building opposition to the war." Le

Blanc said.

New committee studies implications    

of “unfair”

An‘ individual’s home address
is rarely considered a legal mat-
ter. But for about 40 out-of-state
Pitt students, residency and legal

procedure are a serious matter. -

The Committee to End Unfair
Residency Requirements is pre-

H iller criticizes abortion P agency“

by SUE HOENSTINE

Quantity does not necessarily
imply quality, at least in the case

of abortion.

This is the contention of Marc
Hiller. director of Pitt's Health
Service Organization (HSO). Hill-

er has voiced his concern against '

Women’s Ab0rtion‘Referral Serv-
ice (WARS). a Philadelphia agen-
cy which boasts the largest na-
tion-wide volume in abortion re-
ferrals and is presently carrying
on an extensive publicity cam-
paign on Pittsburgh area cam-
puses.

WARS presently refers abor-
tion cases to New York City hos-
pitals with package prices be-
ginning at least $15 over those
provided by HSO. Although coun-
seling is offered, it is not required
and paymentmust be presented
before the operation is performed.

HSO, which provides free abor-
tion referrals, contacted WARS
in an attempt to substantiate the
cost and quality of medical facil-
ities that the agency provided.
Hiller charged that the Philadel-
phia agency does not inform the
woman of where her abortion will
be performed and reported that a
general anesthetic is used on
those patients referred by WARS.

Comparing the efforts of the
HSO and WARS, Hiller said. “Our
referrals (HSO) are in the best in-
terests of the students from an
economic and medical point of
view. while WARS is just out to
make money."

Hiller explained that the H80
has established "city—wide com-
munication with (;~lei‘g'_v Consulta-
tion, Planned Parenthood. and the

n ret'erra:ls

 

f’i.ttsburgh Fm .C1inic for abet’ 

Accordingito Hiller, 90 per cent
of the HSO cases are referred to
Dobb’s Ferry Medical Pavilion,
Park East Hospital and Pelhem
Medical Group in the New York
City area. Urgent cases are refer-
red to Magee’s Women’s Hospital
or West Penn Hospital in Pitts-
burgh. -

A paracervical block. which ac-
cording to Hiller is safer and re-
quires less "hospitalization than
the general anesthetic is adminis-
tered to most HSO patients. A suc-
tion-aspiration method is used at
the New York clinics affiliated
with the HSO. Hiller estimated
the time for an operation to be 30
minutes, with 60 minutes for re-
covery.

A trained counselor meets the —

patient and follows her through
the entire procedure. The cost of
the entire operation is $150. Hiller
said.

plications of state residency and
tuition rates at public universi-
ties and colleges. And eventually
the group may take their case to
court. W

State Senator Benjamin Dono-
low recently predicted that the
Attorney General's decision to
permit student voting on college
campuses could lead to the aboli-
tion of higher tuition rates for
out-of-state students. I.f such
cases’ succeeded in court, Dono-
low estimated that it could'_cost
the state $10 million.

Bob Nelson, a graduate student
in Earth and Planetary Science,
reported that a law firm is pre-
sently being contacted to advise
the grpup. The committee is also
approaching other out-of-state
students who could provide sup-
port and financial backing for

eventual court cases.

Eileen Reiselt, an in—state stu-
dent who is working in sympathy
with the committee, said that any
legal cases would be referred to
the Federal District Courts. "The
chances’ of. legal victory are bet-
ter in federal courts and in the
event that a case is appealed it
gets a wider jurisdiction.

"Now we are attempting _to con-
tact organizations like our own
that may be forming at other
schools and we will encourage the
formation of such agencies." l{ei- _
selt said.

Kerry would

“Ultimately we’d like to see -'

residency regulations struck down
nationwide,” Nelson added. “Then
all public institutions would have
uniform tuition rates regardless
of where the student is from.”

Ken Spindler, a junior political,

science major, defined the group's
concerns as "a purely legal mat-
ter. What we’re arguing is a vio-
lation of the equal protection:

clause of the constitution,” Spind-i A 

ler said.

Spindler and Nelson maintain
that state residency requirements

for college students and legal 

residency requirements are two

‘different things:

“There is a large percentage "

of students without real residen-
cy anywhere,” Nelson contended.
“A student can be a bona fide
adult and live in a community for
years, but he is still denied rights.
of in-state tuition because he can’t

prove his intention to stay until  .

he quits school and works in the

state for a year,” Nelson declared. V

Simmonds predicts faculty union success

gaining representative of the fac-
ulty, the PPU must win the votes
of more than750 per cent of all the
faculty in the University in an
election.

Presently, 'the faculty is not
represented by any bargaining
agent ,

Despite these obstacles PPU
President Paul Simmonds speaks
optimistically about the progress
of the Union. ‘ '

“We started a little over a
year ago and have been growing
very fast,” he said. “I’m very
pleased with the way we've been

recruiting members.”

Simmonds claimed that one
reason for the present success of
the Union is that it takes issue
with problems manyfaculty are
concerned about.

Another reason. he said, is that
“people are not too satisfied with
the way existing organizations
have been dealing with these prob-
lems." The AAUP (American As-
sociation of University Profes-
sors) doesn‘t do much of anything
on this campus, nor does the «fac-
ulty) Senate."

It was Saturday afternoon, as a red, white and
blue blur—the Pitt Camaro—sped around the Pitt
Stadium field. The vehicle stopped abruptly and a
familiar red-haired figure shot out onto the ground;
none other than Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

 How did all this come about? According to Ca-
maro driver Bob Fryer, the idea had first been cas-
ually suggested to a number of administrators, “but
they felt the Chancellor might not be very inter-
ested;”.  

“Then, about two weeks ago,” said Fryer, "the
Chancellor, heard of the idea and became very en-
thusiastic about it. You might say that he actually
provided the momentum for us to drive him in his
exciting grand entrance.”

Fryer admitted that he was quite impressed

the driver from getting crushed in case the car
turns over. _

"You can’t ‘just step out; you really have to
climb out the window,” said Fryer.

“We showed him (Posvar) several ways. and
he just picked the way that was most comfortable.
He must be in pretty good condition—getting out re-
quires grabbing the bar and pulling yourself up. The
Chancellor accomplished all this with great ease.“

The Chancellor actually exited from the Ca-
maro head first, his back to the crowd. He then
swung his legs around and set himself down on the
ground. '

Fryer pointed out that the Chancellor had at
one time been a test pilot and this may partially ac-
count for his prowess.

He added, “I think all the students should make
a strong effort to get to know him; there’s some-
thing very special about him—I just can’t determine
what." .

real power to do anything except
give advice," hesaid.

“The faculty,” he continued,
“participates in all kinds of advi-
sory capacities about the running
of the University. But everything
they do is advisory.”

Simmonds refused to divulge
the exact membership total or the
names of any PPU members.

“A lot of people are afraid for
their membership to be known,
for fear of retaliation." he ex-
plained. “The fact that people are
suspicious and are afraid to re-
veal their membership in the Un-

.. 6%

 

ion says something about the way
they’ve been treated.”

Dr. Jerome Rosenberg, Dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences, labled Simmonds’ fear of
reprisals “totally unfounded.”

“I see no reason why they (Un-
ion members) should fear any
reprisals,” Rosenberg added.

Simmonds said that a unionized
faculty would be of great help to
the administration in its negotia-
tions with Harrisburg. He said

A that the existence of a bargaining ,
agent will lend the Chancellor’s _
budgetary requests greater weight.

Pitt accused in

a11ti-P()]]uti0n suit Classics series: 'for.adults only’-

The Allegheny County Pollution Control Bureau recently placed
formal charges ‘against the University of Pittsburgh and the ‘J. J.

Gumberg Management Company for violation of the County‘s air "

pollution standards.

According to Lawrence A. DeMase, legal counsel for the Bur-'

eau, an investigator found that an incinerator at the Mayflower
Apartments registered a smoke density of “two” on the Ringelman
scale for five minutes, which is illegal by law.

The single chamber incinerator has been operating illegally
since July 1 of. this year, when such devices were declared as un-
acceptable means of refuse disposal by the Bureau.

A hearing scheduled for last Monday in Squire Chan_dler’s of-
fice downtown was postponed because of a schedule conflict with
another case. No new date has been set for the hearing.

A spokesman for the management company, which has leased the
apartment from the University, said that the firm will comply with
whatever the bureau requires and does not plan to contest the charg-

ES.

.1

Kay Bash of the University Treasury Office, which directs leas-
ing transactions, said that the “Gumberg firm is handling the prob-

lem.”

  Black Studies bridge

 Itjis an open secret that dialogue between blacks and
whites ongthis campus is barely beyond the whispering

  

 
  
 

ished in 1969.

A According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences figures.
_ ewer than 1,700 students took a Black Studies course dur-
_:ing the 1970-1971 school year.

. _ < Although unofficial statistics indicate that , over 90
per cent of the undergraduate ‘student body is white. an
qual number of blacks and whites appear to have enroll-
 ed in Black Studies courses, according to an estimate by
jDr. Jack Daniel, chairman of the Black Studies Depart-
,'"ment. In short, a black student is at ‘least nine times more
" likely than a white student to take a Black Studies course.

Why do so few whites takelcourses which couldlgive
hem insights into the black experience and help tear down
.—;the barricades of racial misunderstanding?

 

   

 

   

 

 

  

   
  
   
    
  
   
    
   
    
   
   
  
  
  
  
   
   
   
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
   
   
   
  
  
 
  
   
    
 
  
 
    
  
  
    
   
     
    
   
      

.. , Daniel attributes the disappointing enrollment to a
5 lack of informationabout Black Studies among students,

‘know what a course in African politics or African social-
_ ism i_s about," Daniel laments.

“Many - freshman students .don't even know Black
j_Studies is a Department,” he complains.

‘I gap about Black Studies. 3

However, it is clear that the College of Arts and Sci-
--ences Advising Center is doing precious little to remedy
the problem. .

A Over the summer, the Advising Center distributed an
.-outline to its advisers, listing possible academic pro-
grams to be brought to the attention of freshmen du_ring

'. Jewish Studies and Women’s Studies were.

Presumably, Black Studies was omitted from the
outline because it is not brand new. To incoming fresh-

gmen are probably as ignorant of Black Studies as they are
‘,of Women’s Studies, and the Advising Center should at
7the very. least inform freshmen of Black Studies exis-
=.tence.

, ,_ Furthermore, the Advising Center does_not equip its
advisers to inform students adequately about the,Black
“Studies Department. At orientation sessions for advisors
'-‘earlier this fall, no synopsis of Black Studies was pro-

gress, or course offerings were discussed.

Finally, it appears that some advisers steer white
.7-students away from Black Studies courses where they
- might feel "uncomfortable.” According to Connie Carroll
of the Advising Center, advisers discourage white stu-
;.dents from taking “consciousness-raising”courses in
«Black Studies, suggesting. instead courses where whites
 are more likely to feel accepted. -

The roots of this unfortunatehpracticelie in Black

'_-informally that they are made to feel unwelcome upon
 entering a Black Studies class. '

One white student reports that a Black Studies faculty
I member told whites on the first day of class that the
course was designed for blacks. The student walked out
_ of the room and dropped thecourse. Another white stu-
“dent dropped a Black Studies course after black students
V complained about the presence of whites. .

“Some students are afraid to take Black Studies
“courses,” Daniel admits, but argues that people. have
“unwarranted images” of Black Studies classroom ex-

I institutional racism of America,’-’ Daniel explains. “That
emakes many white students uncomfortable. And they al-
I low their discomfort to take them to some false conclu-
v sions about Black Studies courses.”

Unquestionably, a white will be challenged in a Black
Studies course. Undoubtedly, a white will find a Black

Such stimulation, however, must stop short of har-
rassment, and the Black Studies welcome mat must ex-

i. tend .to whites as well as blacks—not just officially but in

spirit as well.

Asked whether charges of racism in Black Studies

courses are true, Daniel says. "I can’t call it a lie.” How-'

ever,_ he emphasizes that Black Studies are open to stu-
dents of all colors. “I would appeal to any student of any
color who’e ever been rejected in a Black Studies to make
a personalvisit to me,” Daniel urges. His office is located
at 400 S. Craig St.

Unfortunately, white students do not complain_to
Daniel when they encounter racism in Black Studies
courses. And advisers in the Advising Center are often ill

’ equippedto allay a white students fears about taking

a Black Studies course.

One white student recently asked ‘his adviser wheth-
er he would feel unwelcome in a Black Studies course.
The adviser couldn’t say, so the student decided not to
take the Black Studies course. rather than run the risk.

This absurd cycle of suspicion must stop. \

No adviser should steer any white student away from
any Black Studies course. If a white student finds that a

If, on the other hand, the. white student encounters
racism in a Black Studies course, the experience must be
reported to Daniel, so such racism can be eliminated.

If racism does exist in Black Studies courses, it will i

not be ended by whites‘ eschewing courses that are con
sidered “unsafe, ” ’

Most importantly, the Advising Center must not aid
and abet this process. through false sympathy for the
white student.

The Advising, Center can play a major role in helping
bridge a racial gap that more closely resembles a chasm
these days. _

The Center must make students aware-of the oppor-
tunities which exist in the Black Studies Department-
white students in particular, because they are less like-

' ly to hear through the grapevine.

And advisers must refrain from reinforcing the fears
of white students. The implicit racism of the Advising
Center. is as deplorable as that which occasionally rears
its ugly head in Black Studies courses.

 

Under this plan the city would establish educa-
tional standards for all school children which would

Pittsburgh needs a little revolution. The city’s

public schools should be liberated from the omnipo-

, / tent control of the existing Board of Education. Con-

trol of the schools should be returned to the com-

munities. In other words, local control of local
schools. “

The first step to this end would be to elect the
city’s Board of Education and expel all the appoint-
‘ed bureaucrats who now dictate school policy. The
new Board would be composed of nine voting mem-
bers—eight elected from separate school districts
and one chairman elected at large. This Board
would: '

V 1. Collect revenues to pay for the operations of the
city schools;

2. Establish minimum educational and social stan-
dards for all of the city’s school children;

3. Negotiate contracts with the employees of the
city school system, and

4. Plan and direct all programs dealing with the
maintainence and construction of school build-
ings.

Local control would come with the creation of
community school boards. Each school board would
be responsible for the control of one high school and
all of the schools with lower grades which send a
majority of children to that high school. It would
be composed of five voting members—four elected
from separate neighborhoods in the community and
one chairman elected at large.

This community board would:

. Reserve the right to surcharge the community's
schools to collect additional revenues beyond
what is allocated to the community’s schools by
the Board. of Education;

Establish specific educational and social stan-
dards, which are either not covered by or go be-
yond the standards establishedby. the Board of
Education; * """“-‘   ‘

\ jurisdiction, and , -  V.

be. equitably supported by all the citizens. But it

would also allow some parents to tax themselves

more to pay for a better education for their kids.

The provision for local control would permit
communities to emphasize -different aspects of an
educational program. One community might want
more vocational education preparing its students
morerealistically for the job market.

Another_ community might‘_ want to introduce
more college prep courses, while a community
could instead establish pre-school programs to pre-
pare young children for school and provide day care
services for working mothers.

In general, this plan would provideea chance for

greater flexibility and creativity in making educa-.

tional policy. This new dimension would in the long
run enhance the quality of education.

Many die-hard elitists will complain that people
aren’t qualified to control their schools.

Well, if suburbia can do it, so can the city.

A more meaningful complaint by some is thata.
plan like this is inherently negative towards busing.
control works best when it’s neighborhood control.

Admittedly, it’s possible to somehow gerryman
der the jurisdictions of community school boards if
children were bused to non-neighborhood schools.

However, local control with busing would not
work very wellbecause it’s hard to support a

school that belongs to a community that is not your

own.

More important, if this plan is going to be politi-
cally viable it would have to de-emphasize busing,
especially when most parents are against it. This
human and political reality is seen dramatically in
the latest Gallup Poll where 76 per cent of those
people who have heard or read about the issue are
against busing.

«So, if put into effect. this new school plan would
accomplish two objectives long lost in the present
school bureaucracy. It would re-affirm the intrinsic

merit of neighborhood schools an_d give control over , .
the schools to the‘ parents. ’ .-

‘°Anti-ripoff’ businesses prosp

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Even without the wage-price
f'reeze, many concerned citizens
have been imposing their own,
particularly on food, records, and
other miscellaneous items.

.Although record prices have
risen to $5.98, discount record
stores have done their best to
minimize the cost to customers_.

One of the largest of such
stores in Pittsburgh is the Free
People’s ‘Store, on Meyran St.,
run by Joe Anderson and Dick

Low. Prices there are $3.60 or,

$3.70 for albums that usually cost
$5..98’s, and $2.99 or $3.09 for al-
bums priced $4.98 elsewhere.

Organized a year‘ and a half
ago, the Free People’s Store, An-
derson explained, was formed “to
eliminate rip—offs on records.

‘ We’re on a subsistence economy

and not in it to make a lot of
money.” It

Since its inception, the Store
has expanded and has been deal-
ing in‘ other commodities as
well as records.

“We’re selling more things
than a year ago,” Anderson com-
mented, “guitars, books, move-
ment things.”

According to Low, the store has
been j“moderately successful.
But we’re still broke — we put

I our money, back into the Store.”

Heads Together, located on

FMurray Ave. - in Squirrel Hill,

became one of the earliest low-
price stores when it‘opened four
years ago. Records sell for $3.59
and $2.99 there. '

Owner Larry Kosht said that
his objectives are “to fight infor-
mation and’‘ -to stop ripping off
people with high record prices-
there is no need for it.” ' ,

Explaining why he is_abIe to
sell so cheaply, Kosht said that
he operates at “high volume. We
have a small employeeship and
long hours. You have to be there
when people need you.” 0

To date, Kosht said. the store
has enjoyed “moderate success.”
Commenting on the rapid growth

that they minimize costs of ov- .

She reports that thus far the
response “has been great. Peo-
ple come in and compliment the
store. It’s part of the aims of the
business.” '

"You can afford to sell low if
people buy." Hoechstetler said,
“and people do take advantage
of it." He added. however. that

the store is suffering from “lack '

of publicity."

In addition to record stores,
recent years have seen the ad-
vent of cooperative marketing.
Numerous stores throughout the
country sell food and various con-

" sumer needs at minimum prices.

In Boston, 1200 people belong
to 17 different co.-ops, while

co-op members divided among
24 different cooperatives.

  Handel oratorio
performed here

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

Pittsburghers will soon be treat-
to a rare and unique musical
event: the first performance in
the eastern U.S. of Handel’s ora-
torio Athalia.

Long neglected by most musici-
ans. Athalia has been termed the
"first great English oratorio” and
has received its recent American
revivification by Professor Don
Franklin of the University’s mu-
sic department. .

What makes this performance
even more important is that the
majority of its participants are
Pitt faculty members and stu-
dents. Joining the 20-piece orches-
tra and six soloists will be the
Heinz Chapel Concert Choir with
Franklin conducting, in the style
of Handel, from the harpsichord.

The concert, sponsored by the
music departmentand COTA will
be given this Sunday at 3 p.m. in
Heinz Chapel. Although not the
sort of baroque church in which
the oratorio would have been per-
formed in Handel’s day, it is what
could be termed a church of “bar-’
oque” proportions. Not the most
ideal setting, but certainly an ap-
propriate one.

Athalia, composed around 1733,
is based upon a biblical episode

. from the Old Testament drama-

tized by Jean Racine some 40
years before Handel set the story
to music. '

As in the Racine play. the chor-
us is of primary importance. Dra-
matic action excludes much of the
repetition and embellishment
found in many of Handel’s other
dramatic works and, for all prac-
tical purposes, it ‘is a work which
moves swiftly by way of short,
concise arias and lively choruses.

Soloists certainly make or
break any performance and the-

listing for Athalia is a promising.

one. The two leading female roles
will be filled by sopranos Carole
Bogard, a nationally known, ar-
tist from Boston, and Mary Ann

During the weekend of Nov. 5, Dr. Thomas R. Verny,
Psychiatrist, will conduct a marathon weekend: ~

Filling the leading male role
will be Daniel Collins. one of
America’s leading countertenors
(a male voice with about the same

Rounding out the cast will be
Thomas Dean, baritone; Ronald‘

will act as organist for the per-
formance. -

Attendance at recent rehears-
and a conversation with
Franklin convince me all the
more that this coming Sunday is
a red-letter date not only for mu-

sic in Pittsburgh but for music

throughout the country as well.

’We have long recognized Handel’s

genius through such works as
Messiah but have largely ignored
him and his other works for near-
ly two centuries.

It is quite possible that the re-

could be the spark to kindle a new
and greater interest in some of

It does not matter that_the in-
terloper (Elliott Gould) is a mad,
twisted archaeologist who mut-
ters in foreign tongues while

‘ making love. ‘

And it does not matter that the
directorof The Iouch is Ingmar
Bergman. His soundless sequenc-
es and imaginative -photography
are like so many jewels languish-
ing on the lifeless mannequin

Said plot issimple enough. A
happy couple (Bibi Andersson
and Max ..von. Sydow) find their
marriage foundering on the shoals
of adultery.

Gradually, Andersson begins to
feel greater love for her paramour
than for her husband. Or does
she?’ She never seems to know,

.vacillating between the secure
but staid life with her husband

and the exotic, forbidden passion
of her lover. ‘ . —

The tragedy--~of Cher: .faithle's's- -1

ness is not the wreck she has
made of her husband and home,
but the-repeated failure‘ of any
of the triumverate to accept
the consequences of his actions.

Relations between the woman

— and each of the men reel among
unmet ultimata and empty threats.

Andersson and Gould have breath-
ed ‘the touch of life into each oth-
er, but neither is strong enough
to nurture that life. . —

Despite their rather stock roles,

-Andersson and Von Sydow per-

noid, trot out any of the terms

Yet, for all his mania,,Gould’s
character is curiously underde-
veloped.. With so banal a plot,
Bergman might have salvaged the
film with insightful glimpses into

his ‘characters which, after all,‘

are more dramatic than the mere
act'of infidelity.

Also disconcerting is the stilt-..

ed dialogue.‘ The screenplay
sounds as if it were written in
Swedish and translated ‘verbatim
into English.

Missing in The Touch are ‘the
qualities - marvelous‘ intricacy,
subtle and not-so-subtle symbol-
ism, metaphor-that have establish-
ed Bergman as the most crea-
tive, if not the best, contempor-
ary director.

For the average fan, the names of players take on a second-

This is especially true where players on the opponents defense

are concerned. But Saturday, Panther loyalists may be inter- I

ested in familiarizing themselves with a few very big names
and numbers, concentrated around the Notre Dame defensive
line. ' ’

Note, for instance, giants like Walt Patulski (6-6, 260)’, Mike

Kadish (6-5, 260), Greg Marx (6-5, 235), and Fred Swendsen-

(6-4, 235). Their presence on the Notre Dame front four goes a
long‘ way toward explaining why Irish opponents have only tal-
lied 44 points in seven games this year. ' '

Note also that Notre Dame’s 6-1 record includes three shut-
outs and that the Trojans of USC have accounted for 28 of those
44 points scored against the awesome Irish. Quite a fitting list of
credentials for a defense that is considered by many as the best
in the country.

“Perhaps, from what I judge, from what I can see, in all the
years I’ve' been aroii”iid"Pi’t’t‘s‘b’1'i’rgh, "I’*d"g’o“on record"‘as"saying
this is the finest defensive team that Notre Dame has ever had,”

announced Pitt Coach Carl DePasqua at the football luncheon I

yesterday. H_=_ _ , V
Zeroing in on the defensive line DePasqua continued, “They

have a big line, »it’s more ofa gigantic line. The real, true es-

sence of the front four is indicative in the number of tackles that

they. have made. You see!’ the front. four have almost all the

3

tackles, when you total them up, compared to the other mem-
bers of the squad. '

“Normally ‘your linebackers end up making most of your

A tackles, but these big giants from the Midwest are pretty active.

But the Panthers are not planning to lie down and play dead
when gametime rolls around Saturday afternoon.

“We’re going to fight them,” DePasqua said firmly. “We’re

I going to see if we can slug it out with them.”

‘ing along in the last couple weeks, accented by the effective exe—.

 

It’s true that the classic Pitt-ND battle looms as one pitting
strength against strength. With the Cats’ offensive game com-

cution of the Power-I, the Panthers have a store of ammunition
to pick from. Whether they can tame the Irish defense is_ an-
other story but, as'DePasqua indicated, they are certainly go-
ing to try. ' ~

With Bob Medwid out for the season, Dave Havern has been
given the starting nod for the contest. Havern makes up in pass-
ing what he relinquishes on the running game and as offensive
co-ordinator, Coach Bimbo Cecconi said after the Syracuse
contest, “I hope Havern can make up the slack.”

Since the men from South Bend haven’t produced offensive-
ly in any great quantity this season, a touchdown or two may
make the difference. DePasqua is hoping for good field position

and an early tally or two which is a big order considering the‘.

evidence. But then again, Syracuse was suppose to beat the
Panthers too.

stud Big Four race

by VINCE Di NARDO

-For a change. the Big Four
Cross Country Meet scheduled
for this Friday afternoon at
Schenley Parkfs Flagstaff Hill
promises to shape up to be more

than a dual meet between Pitt

and Penn State.

The action Friday will start at
3 p.m. and Banner indicated that,

he’ wouldn’t mind a few people
there to witness a well balanced
meet as well as to encourage his
harriers. '

The inability by both West
Virginia and‘Syracuse to provide
solid competition in the past has
resulted in lopsided victorious
performances by either the Nit-
tany Lion or Pitt, runners in track
and cross country.

This time around _h,o,wever. pick-
ings might not be so rosey for
Banner and Harry Grove’s PSU

_ squad. Pitt and Penn State both

have strong teams but the less
dominant Big Four members have
come up with respectable teams
of their own.

“This meet will probably be
one of the best meets to be held
here in a long time,” Pitt coach
Jim Banner enthusiastically com-
mented as be surveyed Flagstaff.
“All four teams have at least one
big gun. It’s going to be a tough
meet all around.”

The big guns that Banner re-
fers to include some very famil-
iar names with one more year’s
experience. ,

Greg Fredricks anchors the
well balanced State group, which
like Pitt, has yet to be -defeated
this season. To complement_Fred-
ricks, the Lions also sport bal-
ance and depth, as do Banner’s
athletes. '

Bill Huntington and Morgan

.Mosser definitely ,make/ ‘West

Virginia a force tobe contended
with. Two weeks ago, Hunting-
ton and Mosser finished third
and fifth respectively  a dual

- with Pitt meet at the same Schen-

ley Park Course. Only a more
balanced showing by the thin-
clads enabled them to edge the
Mountaineers 25-32.

Orangemen harriers with their
main punch. The New Yorkers
have a—very talented crew of
younger runners to complement
Fisher and they by no means de-
serve‘ to be counted out.

. While Banner was commenting
on the meet, his thinclads read-
ied themselves for their first prac-
tice of the week. John Black test-
ed his leg injury and is hopeful
for the meet.

Pitt’s one two punch, Dave
Szabat and Mike Shurko, will be
ready and for the\_ first time
since the Cleveland ‘State meet
over a month ago, the Banner-

'men could be at full .strength»i_v

if Black is ready to go.

"I hope John (Black) is ready,”
said Banner. “He‘s a heck of a

competitor to have going for you. ;
He’d go through that tree if he}-

thought it would help him beat‘

you. It's hard to tell about his in- ,-
jury though. he runs hard and,;',—

puts a lot of pressure on his legs.”

Banner will also count heavily,
on the rest of his squad to pro- ',
" vide backup strength. Lately there ‘-
has been a stress on togetherness . e

by the runners and if they can
finish close together—as they did.

last week in Buffalo——victory will 

be a much more vivid reality.

A two—year starter at outside linebacker for the
Pitt Panthers, senior Joe Carroll is not particularly en-
thused over the newly installed 5-2 Cat defense.

, “I like playing at linebacker,” related Carroll, "but,
I’d much rather be an outside line-backer in a 4-3 de-
fense than one of the two inside linebackers in a 5-2.

“In high school (Warren. Ohio), I was an offensive
and defensive end. It was easier to switch to lineback-
er in my freshman season here than it has been adapt-
ing to the new assignments this year. With the 5-2 set-
up; there is more physical contact. but my range is lim-
ited.iEven when I see a play developing and trying to
make the stop, I have to step over so many bodies that I
can’t get there in time.” -

The entire Panther defensive unit played Linspired
football against the Syracuse Orangemen in the second
half. Joe feels that confidence has finally spread through-
out the squad. -

“We started to relax more on Saturday. Instead of
worrying about making silly mistakes. everybody is
now concentrating on just playing the game.

“A lot of the juniors and seniors are playing the 5-2
for the first time.” added Carroll. “We are finally get-
ting the confidence that is necessary for a good team.
All season, the defense has/been holding the opposition
in check «play after play, andfthen wham, we're down

“I was fooled pretty badly in the Boston,'College_'

back out of the backfield to entice me out of my prop-

The Pi-tt Ice Hockey Club will
meet its first and perhaps most
difficult test of the 1971 season

 I this Friday as it travels to Erie,
 Pa., to take on the icemen of Gan-
non College.

In their only encounter last
year. Gannon whipped the Pitt
skaters, 6-3.

Gannon boasts eight returning
starters from last year including
junior Larry Russell, who tallied
33 goals in 14 games. Also back
for Gannon is goalie Jerry Greg-
ory who maintained an impres-
sive 1.94 goals against average
last season.

Mark Lieberman will return to
the nets for Pitt while the first
line will be comprised of center
Bill Glanville and wings Dan
Browne and Frank Williams.
Skating on. the.-second line for Pitt
will be center Tom Lang and his

.linemates Mike Kohl and Jim

Richter. A third line has not been
comprised, but probable candi-
dates are Dave Bahnson, Rich
Baginski and Tim and Tom Pav-
lick.

 Gu”nnon offers skaters
 tough season’s opener

and Phil Gesky, a grad student
here.

Although the Pitt skaters have
their work cut out for them, op-
timism is running very high
among the team members.

Club President Joe Testa re-
marked, “I think we can beat
them this year. We .have better
organization than last year and a
better attitude.”

According to Testa, Pitt will at-
tempt to play an offensive game.

“Our chief offensive threat is
our improved. teamwork,” noted

Testa, “And besides, even though

we lost to Gannon last year we
outshot them. Their goalie made a

I   lot of lucky saves.”

 

JOE TESTA

The defensive chores have been
assigned to Terry Browne, Duke

The coaches for the hockey club
are Dr. Ken Metz. a professor in

Luck or no luck, this initial

iexhibition contest should prove

to be a difficult but accurate as-

Bootersi stone Rockets

in finalhome contest 

by STEVE WILLIAMS

“We’re -tough,” exclaimed a proud left winger Bill Rex after the
soccer team drubbed the Slippery RockRocke_ts, 8-1, yesterdayafter-
noon in the Stadium. The game was the final home one for the booters.

A “We passed real good in close," he continued. “Ocassionally the

team was really together.”

By together he might have
meant the-scoring pattern of the
team, in bunches, together. Kev-
in Crowley,-Chucho Valencia, and
Fernando'Cariquirry chipped in

with one goal apiece in the first

period as did Joe Luxbacher,
Crowley, Gus Theofilos, and Bill
Rex in the fourth period.

Rex scored his first and Pitt’s
only goal in the second period,
which at that point put the ‘game
out of reach at 4-0.

Commenting on his third and
fourth goals, of the season, Rex
said, “I played better today than
I have in the last four games.”

“The whole team did a good
job,” Coach Leo Bemis explained.
"The defense was good, but at
times got a bit lax, being that they
were ahead 8-1. '

Incidentally, the entire. season

11 games was only eight goals.

Along with this triumph the.

team also earned the Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Soc-
cer Conference Championship.

The Western Pennsylvania Soc-
cer Conference is composed‘ of
Carnegie—Mel1on University,
Grove City College, Indiana State
University, Edinboro, and Slip-
pery Rock. The booters have de-
feated all these teams enroute to
their present 7-1-2 record.

Coach .Bemis made no attempt_
to run the score up against the
less talented team Slippery Rock.

"I took the third string goalie,
George Hull, and had him playing
halfback,” he explained. “And ev-
eryone on the team was in there

commented Luxbacher. "I live in

Earlier this season, the boot-
ers had difficulties scoring goals:
Their scoring ability has steadi-
ly improved and Luxbacher’s
transfer to Pitt proved exception-
ally profitable in last Saturday’s
game against Edinboro State, a
match in which Pitt swamped

“I wasn’t aware that I could
break the record until after the
third quarter when the coach (Leo
Bemis) sent me out after a rest
and told me to go out and break
the record,” related Luxbacher.

“Once everyone knew that I
was within reach of the record,
they tried to set me up for the
record. Everyone was really
passing well-—they were really

' giving me some great passes.”

Luxbacher felt that the success
of the-booters in Saturday’s con-
test was due primarily to the im-

In an article in Black Action

nounced that he has quit the track
team as a result of a run-in with
-track coach Jim Banner. Schatz-

ble standard in the-athletic de-
. partment’s recruiting and eligib-
E ility practices and that his schol-
arship was removed due to a lack
of credits.

Schatzman quits in scholarship gripe

Schatzman also leveled a blast
at Casmir Myslinski for "showing
little concern for the general wel-
fare" of Pitt athletes. The two-
year member of the highly touted
mile relay team also insisted that
undue distress was put on him as
a result of previous statements in
the Pitt News.

Schatzman was upset about
losing his scholarship. consider-
ing he would have enough credits

to qualify when track competition
would begin in the winter.
Myslinski, in trying to clarify
the situation, contended that the
athletic department had no say in
regards to the whole affair.

"Every fall. before the athletic
competition begins, the Senate
Athletic Committee—a school or-
ganization—votes on what ath-
letes are or are not eligible to
compete for the upcoming season.

THE PITT WOMEN'S varsity volleyball team is hosting a quad meet

I have no vote. I had no say in the
casef'

Concerning the disagreement
with Banner. Myslinski termed it
an absurd accusation.

"Jim Banner has a fine reputa-
tion with his athletes. Schatzman
himself has often said to me that
Banner was the best coach Pitt
had. Now. he is suddenly the
worst.“

About the double standard.
Schatzman stated that he was
once denied access to a training
table because he was a partial
scholarship athlete as opposed to
the full scholarship athletes.

“That’S ridiculous,” Myslinski
answered. "the only way an ath-
lete can’t use the training table is
if his sport is not in season.”

“I have never reprimanded

Schatzman for his previous state- .

merits,” Myslinski stated in reply
to Schatzman’s accusation that he
was put under fire because of his
views.

In the article in the new Black
Action Society publication,
Schatzman also stated that be-
cause of both Banner and Myslin—

ski, 19 quality athletes have been

forced to quit running track in the
last three years.

"I understand we have had a
pretty good track team in the last
three years,” said Myslinski. "I
don’t see how Banner could have
had a good team with so many
quality athletes quitting. The only

  it

DENNIS SCHATZMAN
Airs Gripes
ones I know of have been (Dave)

Garnett and (Bryant) Salter.
They didn’t quit track. they just
chose to participate in football
instead. It all depends what you

.mean when you say quality ath-

lete.”

Myslinski also indicated that if
Schatzman would have enough
credits in the winter, he should at-
tempt to go out for the track team
again and win his scholarship
back.

"It’s regrettable that Schatz-
man chose to pop off the way he
did,” continued Myslinski. “Why
didn’t he come up and talk to Al
Smith (assistant AD). Smith is
black. He could have tried to talk
it out with him.”
