Talk Held on Discrimination CA5 Search committee
S ’ Formed to Select Dean

by LOIS ELDER

“Racism and‘Sexism" was the
topic of Monday's Women’s
Studies Colloquium. with Mark
Senick. an attorney for the Penn-
sylvania Human Relations Com-
mission. as guest speaker.

Senick said. "There are many
racial discrimination cases re-
garding employment. We get
complaints usually dealing with a
small employer—with about 15 to
20 people working for him—who
has hired all white employees.
Cases also deal with large indus-
tries wl/iere blacks are employed

but given men/dial jobs. You don‘t
see any blacks as supervisors.“

According to Senick. the media
industry is one place where racial
and sexual discrimination is be-
ginning to decrease:

"Now were beginning to see
black faces. and now women
aren‘t always theweather girls."

Sex discrimination is not «de-
cided by skin color, but by roles,
according to Senick. “Very often
employers won’t hire women be-
cause ‘they can’t do the job’ even
though they’.ve never tried to see
if they can o'r'not.”

Regarding sex discrimination in
employment. Senick said. "Very

- often. as in the case of grocery

stores. men are hired as stock-
boys right on the spot without be-
ing tested. and women are refused
the job because employers feel

they can‘t.d0 the work. But some-

’times it turns out the men can‘t
lift boxes and need‘ help.

"A major discriminatory field
is in air-flight attendants. Wom-
en were always hired. obviously.
for their appeal. Now airlines are
opening that area for men."

On the topiciof maternity leaves,
Senick said, “Most school dis-
tricts in the Commonwealth have
maternity leaves‘ that are dis-
criminatory to women. Some rule
that women must leave 90 days
prior to the expected date of the
child’s birth.” But, if they can’t
prove it. she doesn’t have to leave

Femnisi Magazine

Several local women have re-
cently put out the first issue ofa
new feminist magazine. entitled
Woman Becoming. Its purpose is
to allow mostly local women to ex-
press their emerging conscious-
ness in many forms-from the po-
litical polemic to fiction. and from
poetry to drawings and photogra-
phy. The first issue has 100 pages
and costs $1.

There are four short stories in
the first issue. Three stories are
about female experiences such as
seduction. abortion. and mother-
hood. all showing friendships be-

,,_,,.tween women from a different

‘perspective. The fourth story is
about an old man. The stories are
written by Virginia Joyce. who
fromerly wrote for the Pitt News
and the Forum; Natalie Petesch.
who has previously published fic-
tion in several national periodi-
cals: Kathleen Searle. and Maria
yon Bolschwing.

There is also an analysis of the
sexism in Mother Goose, articles
on self defense and organizational
problems faced by the Pittsburgh
Women's Center, autobiographi-
cal sketches, and the work go
eight womenpoets. ~

zine are Jan Laude. Juli Loesch.

"Also. some school districts buy
‘male. head-of-household. full
family’ insurance for their em-
ployees. Married women who are
heads of households don‘t get ma-
ternity payments with Blue Cross.

"The school says a woman isn't
the head of a household because
shes married. In one school dis-
trict. approximately 30 women
had’ to pay a difference of about
$20 a month to get head of house-
hold coverage because the school
didn't take out that coverage.“

Senick also cited an \example
where a woman on maternity
leave at one of the steel compa-
nies in Pennsylvania wanted to
come back to work and found she
lost her seniority.

“The company said she was like
a new employee on lay-off status,”
Senick said, “Her name would be
put on" a list and she would be call-
ed. when they needed her. ‘As a re-
sult, she was out of work for eight
months and had a seniority date of
1970- when it should have been
1956, the year she began to work
there.” A '

Senick ended his presentation
with his own view of sexism and
racism. "Racism in days gone by
was a conscious hatred of blacks.
Today many whites are still racist
without realizing it. and some are
racists and won't admit it.

“Employees haven‘t learned
how to be as subtle with sex dis-
crimination as they areiwith ra-
cial discrimination. ‘wind that
makes sex discrimination easier
to detect." concluded Senick.

‘Tube’May Be Permanent

by LARRY PANSINO

The new video tape programming medium——introduced by last
week's showing of Groove Tube—-may become a permanent program-
ming device here at Pitt explained William H. Markus and Daniel Me-
loro. both of the Office of Student Activities. They described the use
of the tapes by the Student Union Board as experimental. with the fu-
ture of the medium's use at Pitt dependent upon its success this term.

i “This is a new dimension in programming." Markus said. "We
started with Groove Tube because of its light subject matter. and plan
to expand to public affairs material. There will be three more video
taped programs this term. plus one more during the spring term.“

, The tapes are commercially produced packaged programs which
the Student Union Board rents from a New York company named Video
Tapes Network. The monitors and other equipment used in the showing
of the tapes are obtained from the Audio Visual Department; S _

The College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) Dean Search Committee
has been formed to select nomi-
nees for the position of Dean of
CAS. a post to be vacated this
summer when Jerome B. Schnee-
wind‘s resignation becomes ef-
fective. The committee is made
up of 11 members. of which eight

are faculty members and three .

are students.
Jiri Nehnevajsa. a professor of
sociology and the chairman of the

Search Committee. outlined brief- _

ly the goals and the guidlines
which motivate the committees
work. "We will accept both nomi-
nations for the deanship and ad-
vice from all students and faculty
members." Nehnevajsa said.
"and we will consider and dis-
cuss every name that comes be-
fore us." _

Besides identifying outstanding
candidates for the position of
Dean, the committee will also be
expected to come up with a final
list ,of three to five nominees,
which will then be sent to the Pro-
vost and the Chancellor for their
final joint decision on the name of
the next Dean.

According to the a chairman.
there have been 15 nominees
brought before the committee. of
which all but two were faculty
members. Nehnevajsa refused.
however. to divulge any of the
names of the candidates.

Qualifications for the deanship
vary with each individual com-

nam Conflict. One of the eligibil-
ity factors is thatthe member of
the armed services must have
served after January 31. 1955.

Students in the POW, MIA de-

pendents category who qualify for’

the/state scholarship aid under the

special program will be eligible.

for up to $1.200 assistance each
year. To qualify they must dem-
onstrate a need for the help, but
their eligibility will be determin-
ed without regard to the financial
status of their parents. The de-
pendents may attend any college.
technical or nursing
school of their choice either in or
out of state and on either a full-
time or half-time basis.

“This is a special legislative
program intended to help the de-
pendents of servicemen in these
critical situations to further their
education. It is most timely and
appropriate now that a prisoner
release is expected to begin with-
in a few days,” said Kenneth R.
Reeher, executive director of
PHEAA. He also said that exactly
how many dependents will be in-
volved in this program is unknown
at this time.

One of the rules of eligibility is
that a POW MIA serviceman

-must have -resided in Pennsyl-

mittee member. each of whom
have different priorities. How-»
ever..some of the most obvious

qualifications pointed by Nehne-
vajsa were: fine scholarship. good ' 
leadership. initiative. an execu- 

tive mind. and an ability to relate

to all constituencies. that is. ‘to 

the students and faculty. as well
as to the rest of the University-
community.\ —

Nehnevajsa is looking forward

to suggestions and nominations by P‘ "

as many student and faculty mem-

 

bers as possible, and he pointed  

out the many meetings which have
been scheduled for the purpose of,
airing nominations. There will be

two meetings on Feb. 13 and I4, I;

Jobs for Engineers Increase

by JAMES GERSTENZANG
Associated Press Writer

NEWARK, N. J. (AP)—There‘s
good news for those entering the
engineering field. The slump that
hit the job market in the late
1960s is disappearing because of
an improved economy and a drop
in the number of graduating engi-
neers.

But the combined forces are
contributing to a shortage of en-

gineers that may become serious.

When the job market tightened

major step toward controlling
pollution from what county offi-
cials say is the region's principal
source of air contaminati0n—U.S.

improvement revenue bond to
be used for new desulfurizing
equipment and improvement to
existing facilities at the sprawl-

authority or to the county, and
no costs whatsoever” to individ-
ual taxpayers.

The Clairton works has been
the target of several environmen-

CMU Announces Ari

Lecture Series '73

Carnegie—Mellon Universitys College of Fine Arts will inaugurate * H
a lecture series Feb. 7 dealing with the relationship between artistic *

theory and practice. .
Speakers in the 1973 Lecture Series will be distinguished factuly

members who will discuss problems that have developed in their dis- 

ciplines.

“The discussions will have an intellectual thrust,” said Akralm.-. ,

Midani, dean of the College of Fine Arts, “but at the same time they
will relate to the problems which are emerging from the professional
education and training in the college.

“I am a believer in the aspect of authenticity in education." he

added. “The relationship between the intellectual aspects of the arts
and the practice of the arts ought to be authentic and precise. leaving ',

no room for dabbling or superficiality."

The first speaker in the series will be Dr. Howard Saalman, An-A
drew Mellon Professor of Architecutre. who is. known for his studies f

in Medieval and Renaissance architecture and the history of cities.
Dr. Saalman, who has been on the CMU faculty since 1958, will dis--

cuss “Rational Architecture” at 8 p.m. tonight in the College of'Fin,e 

Arts faculty room. The following week, on Feb. 14, he will speak on
“Irrational Architecture.” —

A native of Germany, Dr. Saalman is currently working on a two-’

volume monograph on the Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi.

Among his recent publications is a volume on Medieval Cities and a r ” '

study in G. E. Haussman, Paris Transformed. —

Other speakers in the series will be Dr. James L. Rosenberg. play-A   
wright and professor of drama at CMU, and Dr. Orville M. Winsand. ,

head of the University’s Department of Painting and Sculpture. I

Saint Richard

by MIKE MILLER
After considering Senator Hugh Scott‘s proposal to nominate Pres-

ident Nixon for the Nobel Peace Prize, the Pitt News haszdecided to be— '

stow further honors upon him by recommending that he be canonized.
‘We are not advocating violent assassination. but rather. nominating
him for sainthood.
In order to achieve sainthooddcertain qualifications must be met.
Among them, the candidate must lead an exemplary life,‘ he must per-
form miracles and the body of the candidate must not be corrupted.

Whatever "one can say about Mr. Nixon‘s life. it certainly has

I been exemplaryj

_ The qualification of an uncorrupted body is stipulated because
_sainthood usually conferred upon deceased persons. However, Mr. Nix-

‘ on, though very much alive can certainly prove that he is free from
, _corruption.

After the Watergate trial. it is
clear that although there may be
some sinners among the Presi-
dent's disciples. he is above sus-
- picion.

In addition. the residents of San
Clemente have -recently voted
down proposals for the floridation
of water, insuring that his body
will remain uncorrupted.

On studying Mr. Nixon‘s ac-
complishments it is evident that
he has performed many miracles.

The most notable of these was
his resurrection from the dead.
After he gave up the ghost by an-
nouncing that the press would no
longer have him to kick around, he
resumed his political life as the
“New Nixon.”

He also resurrected Jimmy Hoffa like Jesus raised Lazarus.
 He has rained fire and brimstone on North Vietnam.
He has converted the Soviet Union to the doctrines of the Pepsi

 7 Generation.

  
 
  
  
 
   
 

 3 ' By two passes of his hand and clever use of revenue sharing, he

'_;_e_Iiminated welfare. * '
He has cancelled plans for cleaning up inland water ways so that

 I he can walk on them. -
 I He addressed the nation with five loaves and two fishes in front

,,of'him and ate it all, leaving nothing for school lunch programs.
, Mr_. Nixon’s canonization would provide a needed econornic boost.

they could depict him on a cross of gold.

The Sound of Registration

by GEORGE ZRUST

Once more the time for regis-
tration draws near. and once
more it is time for the majority
of Pitt students to concentrate on
determining the way school will
treat them next fall. and maybe
over the coming summer..too.

Well. at least they are going to
try to determine h_ow school will
treat them‘.

I don’t think I have to tell any-
body how easy it is to lose a
“great” schedule when the girl
in Registration finally begins to
pick out the class cards. There
has been plenty of weeping, heart-
breaking, and gnashing of teeth in
the Cathedral’s G-17.

This emotional atmosphere
hardly fits the large. light-blue
room that is so quiet and empty
‘when there is no registration or
add-dropping. ‘

An occasional student will drift
into G-17. take care of a little busi-
ness. and quietly shuffle out again. /

All to the sound of. the low mu-

' sic that is piped into the room.

A picture of placidity.

, The part of this "picture“ that
fascinates me is the music. It‘s
the kind of music I associate with
the cheap night clubs in the
movies,—. or with the dignified.
"good ‘music" radio stations
around Pittsburgh. ’

By no means do I stand at the
door of G-17 and drink in these
pleasant ‘tunes, but what I hear
of them mostly falls into one of
two classes: distorted instrumen-
tal versions of popular songs that
in their pristine form sound good
or fairly good, or instrumental
versions of other nondescript in-
strumentals that never sound
good or even fairly good.

This kind of music may be suit-
able for G-l7’s "off season.".but
it is hardly appropriate for the
hustle-bustle of signing up for the
next term’s courses.

It might’ be an interesting pro-
ject f'or some deserving electron-
ics enthusiast to rig the Regis-
tration office in such a way that
the music, and even certain sound
effects, would fit the mood of the
situation at any given time.

Campaign

by KAREN BURGIO

Politicans are notorious for
not keeping campaign promises-
it's something we all gripe about.
Granted, when an elected official
takes office. his opinions are
bound to change, for he sees
things in a different perspective.

. But it seems slightly disgusting

that “high“ political regularities
have filtered down to our own
Student Government (SG ).

-In an interview in the Jan. 24.

1972. edition of The Pitt News,
newly elected SG President Tom
Bailey said. “I‘ve been against
salaries for SG people since the
issue first came up."
. From the Jan. 31, 1972, edition,
Board member Terri Weaver
said of S_G salaries, “I really
think if you ran you wanted to—-
and you should get out of it the
satisfaction that you're serving.
. . . Personally, I think it’s ridi-
culous.”

At the last meeting of the old
SG on Jan. 25. 1973. the proposal
of the Remuneration'Board Com-
mittee. chaired by Terri Weaver.
was passed by SG. under Presi-
dent Bailey. This gave salaries to

, all student leaders, which are to

be paid from the student activ-

Such a person could presum-
ably be located by running ads in
campus and area publications.
One more person on the Universi-
ty payroll could hardly make a
difference.

, It's. beyond me as to how the
electronic wizardry would achieve
the desired edd. but I should like
to see it executed.

Registration would take on a
new dimension. a new excitement.

As the students mill around the
door before the office has opened,

a recording would be played of a ,

horse racing track, just prior to
the race. The sound of impatient,
snorting horses would simulate
quite nicely the students waiting
at G-l7’s “gate.”

A bugle blows and the students
line up. A bell rings. the doors
are flung open. and the registra-
tion race is on.

Some stirring march is played
as the first students. having the
first crack at the courses. breeze
right in and right out.

As registration wears on, the
music becomes slower and more
melancholy as students contend
with an increasing number of clos-
ed classes. But a student becomes
red with anger and threatens to
strangle one of the girls behind
the counter—a pounding, mind-
rattling piece of hard rock blares
over the loudspeaker.

- The difficulties are ironed out.
and peace again returns to the
room. ,

A soft. soothing melody fills
the air. as if a war had ended and
a new dawn had arrived.

Near the close of registration,
a flustered freshman staggers
into G-17. So far, he has repeated-
ly failed to get every original and
every alternative course he had
in mind.

Taps are sounded.

To be sure. sound effects for
the Registration office is a pretty
crazy plan. ‘

But. then again. registration is
a pretty crazy time.

Promises Peter Out

ities fee. The Pitt News is the
only student activity excluded
from this proposal, for it has an
independent funding contract and

‘pays salaries to its staffers from

funds generated from advertising
income.

Weaver has stated that there is

no other way to fund a remunera- \

tion to student leaders and that
some sort of payment is deserved’.

This exemplifies that both BaiI- ‘

ey and Weaver have done com-
plete “about-faces” on the sub-
ject. It may be refreshing to note
that on this stand, Board member
Terry Sadler said in a Feb. 11,
1972, interview, “If salaries are
warranted, I don’t believe that
they should be paid out of the stu-
dent activities fee,” and he hon-
ored his pledge by arguing against
the usuage of the fee for payment.

Bailey also stated in that Jan.
24. 1972. interview that although
the Board was‘ entirely Greek. ‘'1
don’t think there are any Greeks
involved that are going to carry
their interests to SG.

This reporter has witnessed SG
meetings that have allowed up to
an hour and a quarter of discus-
sion on the Greek Week budget.
No other student activity budget.-

.l.

‘although Engineering Week has

come close. has received so much\
time or attention.

The former SG set up a Pro-
gramming Committee to insure
that all University programs
were spaced out so that activities
would not be bunched onto the
same night.

Last Monday night. the Pro-
gramming Committee sponsored
Col. Herbert, for the same time
as the Student Union Board's Al-
ternative Life Style Conference.

People, based on thier human-
ness are not perfect. But for some
strange reason. it seems that po-
litical platforms were not meant
to be kept.

 

THE Pitt News is open to sug-
gestions for a new column, en-
titled “The Course of the Week." I

Shakespeare in Sf. Louis, Louis?

by JOHN METCALFE

I was inclined to doubt it. too.
M i g ht not have if I did
not know that Joseph Papp has at-
tempted some of the oldest things
in our theater. and generally got-
ten away with it.

Prime time is considered much
ado. and network television is
mostly nothing. but when it all
fell together last Friday it worked.

Let’s get this organized.

Last Friday. in prime time on
network television. we were of-
fered Joseph Papp's staging of
Much Ado About Nothing, by Wil-
liam Shakespeare. It was good.

(Wow. Sometimes the new jour-
nalism is hard to do. ) i

The restaging in Middle Amer-
ica, circa 1910, complete with
Keystone Kops, Seventh Calvary
style military uniforms, and faint-
ly Southern belles worked. The
military are there because back
then they were -well respected,

ception the words are just as Bill
Shakespeare wrote. If you did not
see and hear the play last Friday.
your stomach is probably writh-
ing. It is mistaken. That works
too. and even suggests that once
we were a courtly people.

Costuming is ornate and just

right. The play is a bit silly. and"

so were we in 1910.

I would list the actors and sing
their praises individually and se-
verally, except that I don’t know

~ who they are. No cast list was

provided in the newspapers, and
the credits rolled by too fast to be
copied. I knew they would, so I
didn’t even try.

I did recognize one face fami-
liar to all who loved the Great
American Dream Machine before
its sad demise. Marshall Efron
was a dandy Balthasar. He may
be evenbetter at Shakespeare
than at improvisation.

I will neither praise nor blame.

anyone I don’t know. They were
all good. More than good.

As I mentioned, the text was
mostly Shakespeare’s. A few cuts
were made to avoid too much ob-
scurity, a very few.

The‘ division into acts was modi-
fied. presumably to accommodate
the timing of commercials. Most-
ly. they never missed the actual
end of an act by more than one
scene.

In only a couple of cases was
Shakespeare tidied up for a fami-
ly audience. For instance. in the
first scene of the second act.
where Beatrice says:

“I am sure he is in the fleet.

"I would he had boarded me.“

She is made to say:

"1 am sure he is at the dance:

“I would he had danced with
me.”

(All right. You caught me. Yes.
I did follow a copy of the original.
-But you should recognize every
line a critic cites.)

I liked the play. I have only gone
on at such length because it may
turn up again. perhaps on Public

you to miss it twice.

Just   Wants_ Teagarden

They've gotten to know each
other pretty well on the mat; on
the street they nod “whats goin‘
on" and walk on. No bursts of
emotion, only a mutual respect.

“I guess I’m the wild dude,
and he’s quiet. I see him some-«
times in the summer. He knows
me— we get along,” Bryant said.

Theseason has been something
of a disappointment so far for
Fuddy. but he feels that the team
can do okay in the Easterns. com-

ing up February 23-24, here at ~

Pitt.

"We're a better team than our
record shows." Fuddy said. "Some
meets we could have won. Navy
wasn't better than us. and we
looked good at Clarion. We

shouldn't have lost to East S'troud- .

sburg, either.“

One has to grin. at the matter- ’

of-fact confidence of this skinny-
legged dude with the bum knee,
ligament-spliced ankle and arth-
ritic back. After all, how many
wrestlers do you know who walks
onto the mat complete with a
brass earring run through the left

Fuddy Bryant knows his head~—
"Sure. I'm a popoff. I say what I
think"—but unlike many great
egos of our time he can handle
the prospects ofbeing clammed
up. A loss doesn't shatter him into
bite-sized bits.

"I expect to go the nationals.
I'll be showboatin'. whether I
get beat or not." Maybe I‘ll be
thinking about the Olympics in
‘T6. . .I‘llbe all right."

Fuddy is somewhat dissatisfied
with himself this season, He

thinks he should have more pins,-

but was reminded that. he in-
variably draws the other team’s
baddest dude—a Jim Brown, or a

Browne Paces Skaters

By BART MACK

Take one look at the standings
of the Western Pa. Intercollegiate
Hockey Association and it won't
be hard to see why Pitt is once
again the favorite to repeat as
league champs. The answer lies
only partly in the columns lab-
eled won. lost. tied. and points.

The real evidence behind Pitt's
excellent chance to successfully,
defend the championship can be
found in the goals for and goals
against averages. Pitt leads the
entire league in goals scored with
71 in nine games while running
second to C-MU in goals against.

That tremendous offensive at-
tack has the Lush Line going for
it and. in particular. left wing
Denny Browne. Browne leads
the team in goals scored. having
found the red light 18 times so
far this season. . X

An assistant captain, Browne
has taken up the leadership role
and has played
throughout the season. One
thing Browne has going for him
is the fact that he has kept up
his scoring pace despite his high
number of minutes spent in the

_, penaltybox.

'Those minutes off the ice as-
sessed to the bruising winger usu-
ally have come via his extremely
rough style of play. Browne laid
out an Indiana skater in Pitts
most recent contest with a fore-
man to the mouth but was called
for elbowing by the referee. It
was a typical Browne check in
the scramble for the puck.

Browne has also shown the ten-
dency to drop his gloves at the
slightest hint of trouble and has
acquired quite a reputation-around

inspiringly '

the league for the way he will
handle himself when cl1alleng-
ed. A very solid six feet tall.
Browne has exceptional balance
and finesse on skates and uses it
in every aspect of the game.

That combination of strength
and balance makes Browne a
tough body to move away from
the crease. Browne has an ac-
curate wrist shot from the slot
and can stick-handle through a
maze of players in front of the
met to put the puck past the
goalie. .

Even though» the Lush Line
has accounted for more than a
third of those 71 tallies. all three
line members do not posses any
kind of a phenominally blazing

slapshot. The trio works out the

finer points of passing the puck
to perfection. keeping the op-
position's goaltender in fits with
needling wrist shots. Browne's
bruising style of checking adds
another dimension to the line
that makes them hard to stop.

won't

 

 

Pitt currently trails C-MU by
two points but has a game in
hand. The idea that the Tartans
could actually beat Pitt for the
crown seemed ridiculous to
Browne when he said. “There's
no doubt in my mind that we
‘beat Carnegie-Mellon.
Were going to kick their ass and
that all there is to it.

"They were just lucky when
they beat us before." Browne
continued.

Bolla Is Back

Yes Buzz Ridl there still is a Jim Bolla on your team.

And. Monday night the burly junior gave the Cats a lift when
they needed it. helping Pitt to its ninth win and satisfying cop of ri-
val West Virginia. V

Bolla came in with nine minutes to go in the crucial game and
the cagers immediately increased their shaky lead. Holding a 54-52
lead over the Mounties the hoopsters beginning to get sloppy and the
game was really on the line.

Bolla. who hadn't seen to much action recently both because of

the emergence of Lucius Keese and some disciplinary action. prompt- I

ly tipped in a missed shot and scored a reverse
layup that had to be seen to be believed.

On defense Bolla pulled down 4 rebounds as
well as giving the Cats a physical show.

“Due to the fact the Jim hadn‘t played much
lately. he came off the bench and gave us a much
needed lift." Ridl said after the game. ";At that
point we needed it too."

For the Canavin High School native. who had
maintained a smile despite his apparent demise. .
the performance did not come as a surprise. for the game was play-
ed on a Monday.

 

"I always have a good practice on Monday.“ the: 6‘ 8".-'215

pound center noted. "Against Rutgers (where Bolla led the‘ team‘ 

to a win) the game was also on a Monday night. It‘s too bad we
don‘t play to many games on Mondays." he joked.

Mondays aside. Bolla ’entere(' the season as the team's best
leaper and was expected to win the starting job at the pivot post. But
admittedly. Bolla had failed to produce and has remained unheard
from. ‘I ’
