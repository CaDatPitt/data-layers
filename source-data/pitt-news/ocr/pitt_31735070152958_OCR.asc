Less than a minute of surveillance video
clearly shows the events that led up to
the fatal shooting of Zach Sheridan. But
before Judge Jeffrey Manning ruled on
the case, he said he had to consider the
defendant’s state of mind, something a
video alone could not illustrate.
“What is certain is that the defendant
brought a pistol to a ﬁst fight, a fist ﬁght
in which there was almost certainly a

' consumption of a signiﬁcant amount of

alcohol,” Manning said before he gave
his verdict Monday.

I Manning found Isiah Smith, 23, guilty
of voluntary manslaughter in an Allegh— ‘

eny County court Monday. Manning de-
livered not guilty verdicts on charges
of first— and third—degree murder. He
said he would not give a verdict on an
additional charge_of involuntary man-
slaughter, having already ruled on the
voluntary manslaughter charge. Sen-
tencing in the case is scheduled forjuly

20 years. '

evalute need for

policy

Danielle Fox
Senior Stqff Wrz'ter

In today’s digital era, University faculty

, might have to watch what they say and what ‘

they type.
The University Senate committee on ten-

ure and academic freedom voted yesterday
during its 2 p.m. meeting in the Cathedral
of Learning to establish a subcommittee to
examine whether or not Pitt needs an online
speech policy for faculty. The subcommit-
tee will be comprised of a mix of parent
committee members and faculty volunteers
who will conduct an internal review of Pitt’s
current policies and look into different av-
enues, such as email disclaimers and revised
academic freedom policies. During their
evaluation, subcommittee members will
determine if adding guidelines or clarifying
current documents is necessary to improve
policy and protection of faculty. _

Barry Gold, a co-chair of the commit-
tee, accepted the position of chair of the
subcommittee. g

Carey Balaban, vice provost of Faculty
Affairs, suggested the newly formed sub-
committee should examine the vemacular of
the policies and consider adding guidelines

Liquor enforcement cites l\/Ii

Ranchito for underage drinking

Taira Alabi
Staff W riter

Mi Ranchito, a popular Mexican restau-
rant and bar in Oakland, was issued a
premise citation for underage drinking
early Friday morning before its 2 a.m.
closing time.

The Pennsylvania State Police Bureau
of Liquor Control Enforcement raided
Mi Ranchito, commonly referred to as
“Mi Ranch,” on Atwood Street at 1:30
a.m. Friday. Pittsburgh-based liquor
enforcement ofﬁcers conducted an
open inspection for minors at the bar,
according to officer Eric Swartzwelder,
which was based on a random selection
of establishments to check for under-
age drinking.

According to Swartzwelder, ofﬁcers
issued citations for underage drinking
to seven individuals, six of which are
Pitt students. One of the seven individu-

als was also issued a citation for provid-
ing false identification to an officer.

Swartzwelder said the restaurant will
not be forced to shut down as long as
the owners pay the citation;

Glen Titler, supervisor of the Bureau
of Liquor Control Enforcement, arrived
on the scene after the initial raid. He
said ofﬁcers decided to raid the building
because a number of individuals at the
bar looked under the legal drinking age.

A representative who asked to re-
main unnamed from Pittsburgh Police
Department Zone 4, which includes the
Oakland area, said city police were not
involved in the raid, except for provid-
ing backup to the Bureau of Liquor Con-
trol Enforcement. The representative
also confirmed that the raid was con-
ducted because of underage drinking.

A manager at the restaurant declined
to comment on Monday afternoon. I

VERDICT  

Smith. It also shows Sheridan strik-
ing a woman before Smith produces a
handgun, according to Manning. Two
seconds later, while Sheridan is running
away, Smith fires.

“It all occurred in 44.6 seconds, all in
the twinkling of an eye,” Manning said.

Although the video showed the
events of the shooting, Manning added
he would have to consider what Smith
and others involved were thinking at
the time. ‘

He said his conclusions about their
states of mind were based on testimo-
nies from Smith and other witnesses.

Smith had testified previously dur-
ing the trial that he was acting in self-
defense.

Manning said the law stipulates that
a defendant must reasonably believe he
or she is in danger for a self—defense
plea to hold merit.

The judge said he was convinced
Smith felt threatened, but added this
belief was not reasonable. Sheridan was

fleeing by the time he ﬁred.

Manning added that he thought
Smith didn’t realize he had harmed
Sheridan. In the footage, Smith and his
companions calmly walk away shortly
after he fires.

While Manning said Smith’s actions
were reckless, he said Smith acted in
the heat of the moment, rather than
through premeditation or with intent
to kill.

Manning said he also recognized
Smith had no prior record of violent
or criminal behavior, that he had a carry
permit for his gun and that witnesses
had spoken about his good character.

Aaron Sontz, a public defender rep-
resenting Smith, did not immediately

respond comment Monday.

SPEECH

to help faculty members navigate the rules.
Maria Kovacs, also a co-chair of the tenure
and academic freedom committee, said fac-
ulty members expressed strong opinions
about online speech policies at the last fac-
ulty assembly on April 1.

Kovacs added that there have been in-
stances across the country in which faculty
came under ﬁre from university administra-
tors, news outlets and groups outside of
academia for expressing personal political
opinions online. .

Kovacs sgid the subcommittee should

compose a comprehensive, coherent docu-

ment on;-the University’s speech and aca-
demic freedom policies. She said some of
the documented policies and procedures are
difficult to locate, and one coherent state-
ment would give faculty better access to the
information.

A Kovacs also suggested considering add-
ing a disclaimer to faculty emails stating
that the contents are not conﬁdential and
represent the opinion of the individual, not

g the University.

Online speech policies have spurred de-
bate within higher education circles after a
number of faculty members’ statements that
were made online have traveled outside of
the academic sphere.

An article in The Chronicle of Higher Ed-
ucation titled “One email, much outreach”
reported that Rachel Slocum, an assistant
professor of geography at the University of
Wisconsin-La Crosse, emailed her students
last October during the government shut-
down to explain that they wouldn’t be able to
ﬁnish their assignment without information
from then—suspended government websites.

“Some of the data gathering assignment
will be impossible to complete until the
Republican/Tea party controlled House of
Representatives agrees to fund the govem—
ment,” Slocum wrote in the email.

According to the article, one of her stu-
dents took a screen shot of the email and
shared it on Twitter, where various news
agencies and political groups picked it up.
Slocum and Wisconsin-La Crosse found
themselves at the center of a digital con-
troversy that continues to threaten Slocum’s
career. Slocum remains employed by Wis-
consin-La Crosse.

Other contentious issues have originated
from faculty members’ statements outside

their respective universities. ~

University of Kansas associate professor
David Guth was put on indeﬁnite adminis-
trative leave last September for comments
on his personal Twitter account that “caused
disruptions in the university’s learning en-
vironment,” according to a statement from
the university. .

According to The Chronicle of Higher
Education, Guth tweeted in response to last
September’s shootings at the Washington
Navy Yard, “the blood is on the hands of

OPINIONS

  Digital age poses new concerns
for academic, faculty freedom

A number ofU.S. universities, including Pitt,
must update their seemingly antiquated
speech policies to adapt to the digital age.
Professors and students converse about
course material via email, web—based course

management systems and social media plat- 

forms. Although the Internet offers efficien-
cy, the permanent and distributable nature
of speech intended to be private has sparked
a new debate. The ease of disseminating
faculty members’ online communication
muddles long-ingrained policies that deﬁne
a university’s stance on the open expression
of ideas, employee privacy and work-related
versus personal discourse.

As university administrators at Pitt and
other institutions discuss what employees
should and should not  online within
the boundaries of the First Amendment,
these decision makers must separate such
discourse between personal and profession-
al speech. Faculty members must maintain a
professional presencewhen communicating
publicly or privately online about university
activity as representatives of their respective
workplaces. This isn’t a matter of barring
faculty members from expressingpolitical,
religious or otherwise personal views, but
rather holding communication forwork to
a high level of professionalism.

As a rise in cases of online speech have
caused a ruckus on campuses across the
United States and incited a subsequent me-
dia frenzy, universities face a new decision:
whether to review, revise or add policies
regulating faculty members’ online speech.

One such instance was reported in The
Chronicle of Higher Education last month
regarding a professor at the University of
Wisconsin-La Crosse. The professor sent
an email to 18 students in her introductory
geography class on Oct. 1, 2013 — the first

day of last year’s government shutdown
— regarding revisions to a class assign-
ment. The assignment required students
to compile government data, which they

temporarily could not access because of
the shutdown, so the professor informed
students that “some of the data-gathering
assignment will be impossible to complete
until the Republican/tea party controlled
House of Representatives agrees to fund
the government.” ' S '
Astudentinthe class who feltthe profes-
sor’s message was politically charged took
a screen shot of the email and posted it on

in this case, the
professor’s con-
demnation of the
Republican and
tea parties within

a class assignment
was ill—advised and
unprofessional.

her Twitter account accompanied by the

tweet, “Can’t do my homework for class; -

govt. shutdown. So my prof. blames Repub-
licans in an email blast.”
The predicament went viral. A number
of news outlets, groups suchasthe American
Association of University Professors and
various political and free-speech groups,
along with administrators at the Wiscon-
sin college, rapidly became aware of the
situation. A number of other private citi-
zens bombarded the professor; who is still
employed, with hate mail while she feared
for her job. As a result of the incident, the
chancellor at the University ofwisconsin-La
Crosse issued an email stating that the pro-
fessor’s political reference “did not deserve
the protections of academic freedom,” ac-

cording to the Chronicle, because it didn’t
advance her students’ educational experi-
ence and might have troubled people with
differentviewsy 1 S‘ l  " '
While it’s clear the onslaught of criticism
rapidly blew this exchange out of propor-
tion, it poses a question about whether a
professoraddressinghousekeeping inatters
 a classroom should express his or
her political views. In this case, the profes-
sor’s condemnation of the Republican and
tea parties within a message about aclass

assignment was ill—advised and unprofes-

sional.

During the aftermath of this incident,
the Chronicle compiled information from
more than 70 four—year universities across
the United States and found that about half
of those polled do not have policies in place
regulating faculty’s online speech.

A committee organized by Pitt’s Univer-
sity Senate, the governing body that deals
with tenure and academic freedom, has also
begun to examine the University’s policies
on online speech. The committee discussed
the agenda item during its meeting on Mon-
day and voted to establish a subcommit-
tee to conduct an internal review of Pitt’s
policies on academic freedom to evaluate
the need for and potentially devise such an
online speech policy at Pitt.

The Senate was wise to set up a forum
on its website that allows visitors to sub-
mit their opinions on instituting an online
speech policy, and the Senate should be ap-
plauded for the democratic move as longas
the newly formed subcommittee considers
the responses when draﬁing such a policy.

The role of a professor to guide intellec-
tualdiscourse withinaclassroomis speciﬁc
to stimulating discussion and advancing the
critical thinking of students, not to impose
his or her political, religious or otherwise
personal views upon the students. The same
policy should hold when communicating
online. I

When ‘data
journalism’
doesn’t add up

There is a 42 percent chance of precipitation
this evening. The Pirates" are favored over the
Cubs by two points. With a three-point margin
of error, Barack Obama is projected to be the
next president of the United States.

Statistics, probabilities and estimations
pervade most decisions we encounter from
day to day, whether it’s to don an extra layer
before heading out the door, or to stock up the
safety bunker in preparation for the next pres-
ident’s socialist tyranny. But to Nate Silver,
the high-proﬁle statistics guru who recently
launched the data journalism site FiveThir-
tyEight, they should be telling us even more.

In a lengthy preface he penned to inau-
gurate the ESPN-owned site in rnid-March,
Silver laid the case for a “nerdier” model of
journalistic news analysis. Although he brieﬂy
gestured toward grand ideas such as the value
of good style and anecdote, he spent much of
his 3,500 words criticizing non— quantitative
analysis of the news, even unleashing “dis-
dain” for opinion columns. But if there was
ever an argument for old-fashioned opinions
writing, it is the weakness of Silver’s nerdy
analysis.

Silver’s primary, though often unclear,
argument diminishes the value of anecdotal
speculation on the part of columnists and
analysts. He takes to task the list of failed
presidential election predictors that relied
more on ideological assumptions than sta-
tistical inference. Fair enough, but you don’t
exactly need Bayesian statistics to explain why
“yard signs” and a feeling of energy aren’t
reliable predictive measurements.

He conﬂates news analysis and opinions
writing, however, to resultingonly in muddled
mass of confused claims. It makes sense to

criticize naive attempts at predicting
empirically testable claim-s without sta-
tistics, just as much as we-mock someone
who doesn’t wear a coat because he can
just feel that it won’t be cold. But not all
claims worth holding opinions about are
empirical or predictive. In fact, the most
fundamental ones aren’t at all — that’s
why people continue to disagree about
them. _ .

In the popular SportsCenter model of
political discourse, normative debates on

who ought to be the president give way _

to predictive debates on who probably
will be. Professionally raised in ESPN, it

makes sense that Silver operates within.

this model. It’s not inherently bad, either
— someone needs to make -predictions
about elections and policy preferences.
And just like on SportsCenter, it helps to
see diagrams and numbers to make sense
of the information. V

But there’s a big difference between
saying “the Seahawks will beat the Bron-

cos on Sunday” and saying “the United
States will be a better country if the Se-
ahawks beat the Broncos.” No such dis-
tinction exists in sports discussions. It
does, however, in politics.

Therein lies the beauty of opinions

writing done well. We all have fundamental ‘

beliefs about public

and economic journalists should certainly
inform any thoughtful stance, but it can
only go so far. Even if ‘a graph can show

bolstered by personal anecdotes can
accomplish what opinions writing does
best —— elevate the level of democratic

_ discourse, not settle it.

Take, for instance, the contentious de-
bate on the increase of the minimum wage.

Statistical analysis supplied by economists ~

clear and elegant

writing, can thrive.
Such values do not appear in Silver’s
discussion. As opposed to the rigor behind
statistical belief updating, he contrasts

. the open-ended genre of opinions writ-

ing, which, he argues, does not seem “to
abide by any standard at all.”

But why is that a bad thing? The rigid '

space, the num- '

methodologies of statistics are necessary
to provide reliable information, but Silver

 and his colleagues must recognize the lim-

ited familiarity of the general public with
such methods. So rather than provoking a
reasoned response, such statistical argu-
ments serve largely to dazzle those who
agree and turn away those who disagree.
A layman won’t easily argue with a graph,
so he’ll instead disregard it and look for
one he likes. ‘

Though ‘his call to increase the nu-
meracy, as opposed to the literacy, of
the American public is admirable, Silver
can’t responsibly begin the task simply
by inserting graphs without explicating
the method.

It would be naive to say_that an original
voice like Silver’s has nothing to say about
journalistic practice. Indeed it has pro-
voked what I hope has been the thoughtful
response which you are about to conclude.

So far from ending the dispute with el-

egant graphs, Silver has provoked one
with inelegantargument. Maybe he’s more
of an old-time columnist than he would
care to admit. I

With a complex past, continued U.S.

recent presidential elections, Afghanistan
has been a staple of our news over the past
12 years. Often, the perception we are left

has used the cuisines of foreign nations to

tion for these nations’ unique, and often
misunderstood, cultures.

According to Conﬂict Kitchen co—di-
rector Dawn Weleski, Afghanistan’s na-
tional struggles often cause us to forget
that the culture of the country is still alive
and thriving. Since the kitchen originally
opened in East Liberty in 2010, it has
been using food from countries around
the'world as an entry to cultural under-

_ standing. Weleski said that the purpose

of serving food from Afghanistan is not to
provide a political commentary, but rather
to “create a public dialogue.” And what is

' a better medium for dialogue than food?

Just as in many other cultures around
the globe, Afghan food is not only ‘sus-
taining —’ it’s part of what brings people
together. Afghan specialist and professor

International Affairs Jennifer Murtazash-
vili said in an email, “As in most cultures,
food plays avery important role in hospi-
tality. If you enter [an Afghan] home, you
will be offered tea (chai) and then food.”
In order to try and present an authentic
Afghan menu, Conflict Kitchen had a mul-
tifaceted andinvolved approach.
According to co—director and founder
Jon_Rubin, Rubin and Weleski “found reci-
pes from cookbooks and tested everything
with the local Afghan community.” They

then carefully listened to the feedback of .

the natives and adjusted the recipes ac-
cordingly. Although Conﬂict Kitchen did
have a version of Afghan food in its previ-
ous East Liberty location, they expanded
the menu in this second manifestation.
One of the most popular recipes, ac-

cording to Weleski and Rubin, is the Ka-

Cultural Exchange; Conflict Kitchen debuts Afghan

buli Palow, which is a slow-cooked lamb

with candied carrots, rice and raisins — a‘
simultaneously sweet and savory combi-

nation.

Although the food may be a large draw,
the information provided on ﬂiers and
many of the wrappers and packaging that
the food comes in creates inter-cultural
dialogue that enhances the experience. *

Brett Yasko, graphic designer for Con-
ﬂict Kitchen, says this atmosphere has
been a large part of the establishment’s
sustained success.

“Yes, the food is great and it’s probably
still the No. 1 reason people come. But

TPN’s resident beer nerd
picks the best spring brews

Hop Sun is among the top choices for spring beer.

Jackson Crowder
Senior Staff If/riter

At long last, spring is springing. The
lingering traces of winter are (slowly)
disappearing and the sun is shining a
bit more brightly than it was just a few
weeks ago. What does this all mean?
New beers to drink, obviously.

Spring is a versatile beer season —
not so cold that it demands something
heavy but not so hot as to demand
something light, either. A good spring
beer occupies the comfortable middle,
loaning itself well to drinking while
watching the NCAA Tournament inside

or while kicking back on your porch and
enjoying the sun.

Here are a few suggestions for good
beers to get your spring started off
right.

Brewed for summer but perfect
for spring, Southern Tier Hop Sun is
a widely available, can’t—miss choice.
Like a lot of choices that go well with
the emerging season, Hop Sun is wheat-
based, but is hopped to the point where
you might not guess it. It’s light on body

AMERICA

Although Marvel has recently had
difﬁculty making these smaller, post-
“Avengers” ﬁlms memorable and distin-
guishable from one another —— released
less than six month ago, “Thor: The
Dark World” is still a strain to recall ——
Cap’n’s latest solo outing is a substantial
and conﬁdent step in Marvel’s genius
money-making ruse.

Since “The Avengers,” Steve Rog-
ers (Chris Evans) has been adapting to
modern life in Washington, D.C., and
assisting S.H.I.E.L.D. in its espionage
endeavors. In his most recent assign-
ment, Captain America must help res-
cue an ally ship under attack. During
the mission, Rogers ﬁnds agent Natasha
Romanoff, aka Black Widow (Scarlett
johansson), secretly stealing informa-
tion from the vessel’s computers. Back
home, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)
attempts to decrypt the information,

but is unsuccessful. S.H.I.E.L.D. is later
compromised by assassins led by the
Winter Soldier, a stealthy and danger-
ous foe equipped with superhuman
strength and a burnished metal arm.
Afterwards, executive Alexander
Pierce (Robert Redford) meets with
Rogers, believing he is aware of what
information Fury stole. When Rogers
confesses his lack of knowledge, Pierce
labels him a fugitive. With the help of
Romanoff and Rogers’ friend, Sam Wil-
son (Anthony Mackie), Rogers must

The initiation will be held in the

overlooked, please contact Prof. Herbert Chester, Prof. Edwin Floyd, or Prof. Illichael lrVest'.

go undercover to unveil the corruption
surrounding S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to
prevent global disaster.

Needless to say, things get a tad con-
voluted, but the film is seldom unin-
teresting. While the story reaches for
the grandiose, the importance of “The
Winter Soldier” feels inevitably lim-
ited. But even though large portions of
the ‘Captain’s sequel are decidedly un-
remarkable, brothers Anthony and Joe
Russo stimulate the ﬁlm with startlingly
adept direction, most exemplified in
the handful of well-executed action se-
quences and the speedy pacing. Two

hours and 15 minutes has rarely gone

byso quickly.

The action should not be dismissed as
mere childish fun — the Russo brothers
have crafted an expert style of supplying
comic book thrills. Teetering between

ycartoonish and gritty, “Captain America:

The Winter Soldier” blends harsh vio-
lence and the typicallylcolorful visual
scheme with unexpectedly tantalizing
results, particularly in the hand—to-hand
combat moments. In Marvel’s movie
world, Captain America is about as real
as it gets, free of the sillier fantasy and
science fiction elements of our other
beloved Avengers. So with a more promi-

_ nent essence of realism, the ﬁghts are

grainy, dizzying and ‘brutal — the less
CGI, the better.

Evans is appealingly straightilaced
as usual, Johansson overcomes her oc-
casionally mediocre dialogue and is as
alluring as ever and charismatic Mackie
as The Falcon makes for an excellent ad-

' dition to the Marvel cinematic universe.

The Winter Soldier is also a formida-
ble villain — shrouded in mystery and
genuinely intimidating. It is thrilling to
see Captain America meet his physical
match with this nearly silent nemesis.
Atits worst, “The Winter Soldier”
may be overly slick and manufactured,
but on the whole, there is some brisk,
exciting and serious fun to be had.
Enjoy the appetizers while they’re
here — the main course is soon to come.

SPRING BREWS

pale ale. Refreshing, ﬂavorful and just
complicated enough to keep its drinker
coming back, Hop Sun will never lead
a springtime consumer astray. Brewed
since 2004 and now a stalwart in South-

ﬂern Tier’s seasonal lineup, H_op Sun is

available just about anywhere that sells
good beer.

For the more adventurous out there
in search of a more dangerous brew, try

Green Flash’s Palate Wrecker Doubled

IPA. True to its intimidating name, Pal-
ate Wrecker is a big, strong beer, weigh-
ing in at 9.5 percent ABV. Though it’s one
to be careful with, it’s also one of the
more rewarding beers available today.
If nothing else, it certainly wakes the
palate up after a long Winter of stouts
and porters. Palate Wreckeris one of the
more hop-'forward beers available, but
for those experienced with the curious
little green ﬂowers, it’s also one of the
more nuanced ales out there. Behind
the hop bitterness is a strong flavor of
grapefruit that helps mask i-ts high alco-
hol content and takes some of the sting
out of the hops. This characteristic adds
tremendous balance to the beer, giving

. it a refreshing quality that is missing in

many double IPAs.

Finally, every season has a go—to beer
that just seems too perfect to ignore. For
spring, this is Harpoon’s UFO White.
This rather ubiquitous -wheat beer is
available pretty much anywhere from
beer distributors t_o gas stations — de-
pending on where you are —, but always
seems to get the jobldone. Its body, thick
with wheat and yeast, can stand up well
to colder temperatures but is also light
enough for when the weather begins
to turn. The pleasant orange peel and
coriander notes, as well as the forgiving
4.8 percent ABV, make it an ideal beer
forjustabout any spring situation. It’s
perfectly appropriate for-a cookout, a
baseball game, a cool night by the fire
pit or for just soaking up some long-
absent sun.

Spring is ﬁnally here and it couldn’t '

have come fast enough. Fortunately,
there’s a bevy ofgood beer to ease us all
out of the cold and on toward summer.

COLUMN

Questions still abound before student-athlete compensation is decided

4 Dan Sostek
Stqff Wrz'ter

t The recent decision by the Chicago dis-

trict of the National Labor Relations
Board to allow the Northwestern Uni-
versity football team —— in a movement
led by former Northwestern Wildcat
Kain Colter — to unionize thrust the al-
ready prevalent issue of paying college
athletes even further up to the forefront
of discussion. ‘ _

The list of reasons for compensat-
ing college athletes is long and valid,
as most of the logic boils down to uni-
versities generating immense amounts
of revenue without having to pay the
revenue generators —— primarily the
athletes —— by hiding behind the veil

of amateurism.
However, despite all of the reasons

I to pay college athletes, there are still
plentyof questions that need to be an-

swered‘, precedents that need to be set
and fears that need to be calmed before
implementing a system of student—ath-
lete compensation.

There are still three big questions
that I would like to see answered:

1. How will the pay be determined?

This is the most important question.

Will it be a standard rate for every
athlete, or will different factors such
as position affect the athlete’s pay? For
instance, there is reason to question
whether a walk-on basketball player
would make as much as the starting
center, if pay would be determined by

- performance at all.

But perhaps an even bigger issue
would be whether different universi-

ties would have different rates of com- '

pensation. If so, this could potentially
turn recruiting into a bidding war, _or
into a collegiate free agency. The bal-
ance of power would shift and greatly
favor programs that would be willing
to spend more.

The NCAA would have to ensure that
this does not happen, and the best way
to do so would be to issue a standard
rate of pay while also allowing the ath-
letes tq proﬁt off their likeness. This
would allow elite players to benefit
from their superior talent.

2. Who would be getting paid?

The payment debate is almost always

centered on football and basketball,
but what about the other athletes on
campus?

One option would be to pay a stan— .

dard-rate for each sport based on pro-
portional revenue. But to rehash the
walk-on basketball player example,
there would be plenty of gripes with
the fact that a walk-on would be‘ paid
more than the ace ofthe baseball team
or the top sprinter on the track and
ﬁeld team.

Then there is the looming issue
of the impact on students who aren’t
athletes but are involved with athletic
departments.

Would members of an elite-level
