Havel
struggles
toward

2 democracy

By Eric Hoch
sum Writer

In the past year Ivan Havel and
other members of the Civic Forum
in Czechoslovakia have been busy
with the transition from the
totalitarian regime to the new

. democracy now forming in that

(A

country.

“Since the revolution many of
us have been so busy we could
not even appreciate the revolution
— not even enough time to enjoy
it,” said Havel in an interview
yesterday. “There is so much to
do, and it takes a lot of time
because very few have the

_ administration skills to set up a
I democratic government and free-
market economy.”

Since the beginning of the
transition, the biggest obstacle
has been getting the citizens to
understand what is going on,
according to Havel. Havel is the
brother of Vaclav Havel, the
president of Czechoslovakia. Ivan
Havel spoke at Pitt Saturday and
Monday about the revolution and
where it is at today.

, “Convincing the people to just
let the Communists go and not
have revenge on them was one
problem, as well as getting them
to trust any government at all,”
Havel said. “You see, with
democracy, the people must trust
the government, and because of
the Communists many people do.

“Spoiling” the minds of the
people in this ‘way has also
affected the people’s reaction to
a free-market economy, according
to Havel. -

ROTC honors Veterans and POWS

goldﬁsh

By Michael P. King
For The Pitt News

The Pitt chapter of Amnesty
International held a Save the
Goldfish campaign in the Towers’
lobby yesterday in an attempt to
raise public awareness of the
prisoners of conscience around
the world.

“We are detaining goldﬁsh for
the same reasons that political
prisoners are being held,” said
Jennifer Coopie, president of
Amnesty International at Pitt. The
event was held as part of Human
Rights Week.

Reasons for detainment such
as, “I am being detained because
I housed political refugees,” and
“I am being detained because of
the color of my skin,” were written

0 on the cups, which held goldfish
that could be won by bouncing a
ping-pong ball in an empty cup.

Surrounded by trees marked with the traditional
yellow ribbons of remembrance, the Pitt Air
Force ROTC held a Veterans’ Day memorial
ceremony on the Cathedral of Learning lawn
yesterday.

The ceremony honored the 2,296 American
soldiers who are missing in action or were
prisoners of war in the Vietnam conflict, and it
involved the entire Air Force ROTC detachment
and several members of the Army ROTC Panther
Battalion.

Pittsburgh-area families of POWs and MIAs
were special guests, “as a show of support to
them,” said Cadet Col. Amy Shalikashvili,_ Air
Force ROTC cadet corps commander.

This gesture was especially comforting to
Edward and Mary Rykoskey, parents of a Marine
Corps corporal missing in action since Aug. 18,
1966.

“You know that people care about you,” said

Mary, who said that she and her husband attend
“every one of these ceremonies.”
Edward stresses that no one should be allowed

‘to forget that there are still servicepeople

unaccounted for. “If there’s another war, people
should know what they’ll have to go through 
families gotta wait and suffer for the bodies to be
returned,” he said.
They have heard nothing further about their
son since the day he was declared missing.
After cadets read a partial list of names of
Pittsburgh-area MIAs and POWS, Shalikashvili
acknowledged the accomplishments of these
soldiers in preserving American freedoms.
“Today we come together to honor them and
remember what they did for us,” she said.
Army ROTC Cadet 2nd Lt. Rich Howett urged
a combined effort by all Americans to recover
their missing. “We, as soldiers, are here today to
lend our support to the program to bring us
information on those still unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia,” he said in a speech at the
See Veterans, page 3

the goldfish being detained and
the detainment of political
prisoners, Coopie said.

Instructions on how to feed the
goldfish and clean their water
were given out with the fish in
hopes that the new pet owners
would take good care of and
enjoy their new pet.

Not everyone was taking care
of his or her newly attained pet,
though.

“One guy said he was going to
feed it to his piranha, and another
guy swallowed it right away,”
said junior Kitty Petruccelli.

Petitions to free political
prisoners were available, and a 4-
by—5-foot wooden cage similar to
the ones used to hold prisoners
in Columbia was set up to give
people an idea of the horrible
conditions in which prisoners are

down on people who wish to be
successful businesspeople, and
this will hinder the creation of
capitalism in Czechoslovakia,”
Havel said.

Besides the problem of having
to re-educate the people to show
them that they can trust
democracy and capitalism, the
Civic Forum must also deal with

"‘“e.a failing economy and an

environment filled with polluted
air and water, both of which
were left by the Communists after
they were ousted from the
government, according to Havel.

However, some changes came
quickly and easily. The three
biggest changes have been

«opening the borders, ending

censorship in the newspapers

Gree/es begmfood drive to az'd1?az'nbowKz'tc/yen

By James Wechsler
Sta1fW7i1'ter

Members of Kappa Alpha Theta and Sigma
Alpha Mu have cooked up a project that is
making mouths water.

These Greeks have initiated a food drive to
benefit The Rainbow Kitchen, a community-
service agency based in Homestead, and the
area residents whom it assists.

“Since it’s around Thanksgiving, we wanted
to get in the spirit of the season and make
other people’s holiday a little happier,” said
Debbie Schweikart, community service
chairperson for KAT. “We’re asking each
member to bring in two non—perishable food
items.” ' -

Schweikart, who organized the program,
said the target is _200 food items.

“The goals of our food drive are to increase
the social consciousness of our members to
the plight of , the hungry and to make a
positive contribution to our society,” said
Schweikart. “We, as college students, aren't
really exposed to that situation  except for
the vagrants on the street in Oakland or
downtown asking for money, but a lot of
times you just walk by," she said.

Schweikart added that the food drive is part
of an attempt by the Greeks to take a more
active role in society.

“We do need to have our food stores
replenished,” said Donna Finnie, 61, of The
Rainbow Kitchen. She said the kitchen
sustained smoke and water damage, as well
as the loss of some of its pantry stores, as the
result of a ﬁre in a neighboring bar.

“The community has been very responsive,”

said Finnie. “Since the fire we've had all these
people calling and wanting to have food
drives for us. It's made us more visible,”
Finnie added.

“We’re just trying to help them out,” said
Mark Corsi, fund—raisin g chairperson for SAM.

Finnie said that The Rainbow Kitchen
receives massive amounts of baked goods
and juices, but he added that it would like to
see more donations of coffee or another hot
beverage because of the cold weather.

According to Finnie, much of the food
donated to The Rainbow Kitchen is consumed
through the hot-meal program, which is
offered every weekday from 11:30 a.m. until
1 p.m. Finnie said that about 1,200 families
are registered in this program.

“We go through a terriﬁc amount of food
here,” said Finnie.

Editors’ note: The following is
the sixth column in a series
entitled ’’Know Your Rights, "
published bl-weelely Timdays in
The Pitt News.

First Amendment, U.S.
Constitution

Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof; or abridging the
freedom of speech, or of the
press; or of the people peaceably
to assemble, and to petition the
Government for a redress of
grievances.

Your basic rights stem from
these powerful words. Everything
from the separation of church
and state, your freedom to read,
your right to association and a
long list of derived freedoms come
from these mighty words: The
First Amendment.

As a part of your First

Amendment guarantees, the
freedom of political protest is
not as “free” as one may believe.
Rules govern political rallies,
campaigns and protests. The
large rallies in Washington, D.C.,
like the 1987 March for Lesbian/
Gay Rights, can draw hundreds
of thousands of people. Events
like those require planning and
plenty of work. People cannot
just show up and protest in
numbers as large as these without
bureaucratic maneuvering.
Below, I have outlined general
guidelines for local political
action. S

Q. What should I know about
picketing and protesting in
Pittsburgh?

A. You must stay on the sidewalk
unless you apply for a permit to
occupy the street. In Pittsburgh
you need to contact the
superintendent of police to obtain
the permit. Give the
superintendent at least 24 hours
to grant your request to picket.

A. It’s illegal; Duquesne Light

owns the telephone poles.
However, everyone from local

workers does it

Q. What about rallies or
leaﬂetting at the University
of Pittsburgh?
A. In order to rally or leaﬂet in
front of the William Pitt Union,
you must contact WPU
reservations at 648-7817. Flyers
to be posted in the union must
be approved at the information
desk. The union staff will post
your material. To post ﬂyers in

Havel

Continued from page 1

‘Marxism in the schools, Havel

said.

Although Havel knows that the
times ahead will be hard, he feels
that transition has several good
reasons to continue.

“The Velvet Revolution was
comprised of many intellectuals
who had different ideas about
how a government should work.
These people have worked very
closely together in order to bring
about the revolution, and
knowing that they can trust each
other will make the transition to
democracy smoother, ” Havel said.

“Also, many of the youth have

"5 helped bring about the revolution

as well, which shows that the
youth, who will one day run
Czechoslovakia, have genuine
interest in having democracy and
capitalism in the country.”

Furthermore, the people show-
ed strong support for the
revolution.

“Through the most extra-
ordinary method, the dissidents

Veterans

and the people communicated
their ideas to each other each day
before the revolution by word of
mouth. This relationship was an
awesome thing to see,” Havel
said.

Another thing that helped the
revolution was lack of military
intervention by the government,
according to Havel.

Before the Velvet Revolution,
Havel, who has a Ph.D. from
Berkeley in computer science,
was a research scientist at the
Academy of Science in Czech-
oslovakia, until he refused to
sign a petition condemning
Charter 77. 1

According to Havel, Charter 77
was composed by the intellectual
dissidents in January of 1977 and
called for more human rights in
Czechoslovakia. The Communists
wanted to stop this movement
and asked prominent intellectuals
to sign a petition. When Havel
refused to sign, he said that he
was no longer permitted to
conduct research.

During the next few years, he
held group meetings where
people discussed the need for
change in Czechoslovakia. These
meetings were kept secret
because they were illegal.

In 1981 Havel helped to write
and publish reading materials on
change in the government. This
action was illegal as well, and he
and several other people were
arrested when a truck carrying
these materials was stopped and
searched by the secret police.

“I spent four days in detention,
and during that time I could only
visualize what would happen to
me,” Havel said. “I had nothing to
read, and I was all alone. One
could only visualize the worst
possible outcome. I kept thinking
about scientiﬁc concepts and
problems to get my mind off of
the situation.” -

Havel said that upon his release
he was told he would be tried for
his crimes, but this never
happened, due to the revolution
which came eight years later.

Continued from page 1
ceremony.

“We Search today for the
meaning of such a war as Vietnam
— why we fought, why we died,
why some of us never came
home,” said Howett.

The POW/MIA ﬂag, a black
banner with “You are not
forgotten” printed on it, was
lowered to the ground, followed
by a moment of silence for the

hundreds of thousands of troops
involved in Operation Desert
Shield in the Middle East.

The possibility of war against
Iraq seems to be even more
pressing on Veterans’ Day, said
many of the cadets.

“This has more meaning for
those of us who are in the service.
In another 20 years they might be
calling out our names,” said Cadet
Maj. Doug Brick.

The Arnold Air Society
sponsored the ceremony for two
reasons, said Cadet Maj. Meg

Hasper, commander of the
society.
“First, to educate the

community about POWS and
MIAs because they still exist —
they're not something from the
past. Also to honor the families
and to honor the people that are
still lost,” she said.

Extra fo rces unnecessary. .. A

Operation Desert Shield is quickly becoming Operation
Desert Sword. '

When Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the world
condemned Iraq and vowed that Saudi Arabia would not
become the next victim of Iraqi aggression. That honor
may be given to the United States.

America sent an estimated 230,000 troops into Saudi
Arabia to defend that country. At that time, President Bush
told the nation that this move was purely defensive in
nature. _

Last week, however, two events occurred that turned
the American presence in the Persian Gulf region into a
threat for all involved. First, Secretary of StateJames Baker
went on an eight-day world tour, trying to drum up
support for an offensive campaign, should it be needed.

Soon after Baker’s trip began, Bush and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney told the world that the United
States would be sending 150,000 more troops into the
region, nearly doubling the existing force.ﬂThey openly
stated that this force would now be considered a potential
offensive threat. .

The United States does not need to have these extra
troops in the region. They are only going to antagonize
an already tenuous situation, one which has the world on
the brink of war.

Though Iraq has a large standing army of one million
men, not all of them are massed on the Saudi border. The
effects of an eight—year war with bordering Iran cannot be
diminished‘ with a few nice words. Turkey, a member of
NATO, lies on its northern boundary and also cannot be
ignored. Iraq must keep some of its troops in reserve in
case one of these groups attacks.

230,000 is easily a sufficient force to keep Iraq out of
Saudi Arabia. In a defensive mode the troops already in
place could keep Husseinat bay.

There have already been more than 30 casualties in
three months among the troops of Operation Desert
Shield because of various accidents, such as plane
crashes and soldiers who have been run down by jeeps.
Should war break out, many experts estimate that 30,000
people will die within a few days.

With 230,000 American troops already in the region,
tensions are already at a breaking point. With this
addition, one shot —— even an accidental one — could
trigger a war that, once started, could be very hard to
control.

When Desert Shield began, it was a rallying cry for the
United States to keep this as a conﬂict between Iraq and
the world. With this offensive move, however, the
situation is becoming more and more like the United
States against Iraq.

Budgeting blunders abound

Not too long ago, I attended a~rally along with
approximately 50 other Pittsburgh-area residents
to protest our nation's solutions to titanic economic
problems and to demonstrate my skepticism of
our organized political system which, seemingly,
isn’t very organized. More speciﬁcally, however,
it was recent tax hikes that motivated me and other
troubled Americans to exercise

to other countries. If we are a capitalist, democratic
republic that has confidence in our system, then
we shouldn’t have to buy allegiance from other
countries. We must stop bartering for allies and
start to invest in ourselves. I

How can we trust other countries when the
people that we have elected in our own country
have purposely avoided telling

such constitutional rights as
freedom of expression on a day
dubbed “Taxpayers’ Action Day. ”

Concerned citizens in over 200
cities across the country formed

Spencer
Borisoff

us the truth for years? Our deﬁcit
didn’t just creep up on us. It isn’t
a result of a planned sneak attack
by Saddam Hussein. Our deficit
has been a truth that Congress

picket lines and held signs to
protest a national deficit‘ that is .
so lofty that the figure doesn’t even fit into an
average calculator. '‘

The most maddening aspect of this economic
disaster is that we, the people, are expected to
shoulder the burden of our government’s boundless,
budgeting blunders. It is we, the people, that are
required to rescue the country from this national
deficit —— a deﬁcit that not even Indiana Jones
could dig his way out of.

Our government, in response to the deficit, has
proposed a $496 billion deficit—reduction plan that
opts to cut spending on Medicare, to increase
income taxes and to levy taxes on airline tickets,
tobacco, alcohol, gasoline and luxury items. At the
same time, our elected body of officials has
schizophrenically endorsed wasteful, moronic
programs such as the $500,000 investment to
restore the boyhood home of Lawrence Welk.

Equally senseless is how we keep lending money

Furthermore, taxation without representation is

illegal. Sure, we have local and state spokespeople

0 who supposedly represent the interest of the

people. However, if youlthink about it (or even if
you don’t think about it), it is plainly evident that
these representatives do not ask us about our
concerns or tell us where our money is going. On
an individual basis we have no voice as to how we

would like our money spent. Investing $500,000 in .

restoring the boyhood home of Lawrence Welk is
like throwing money in the sewer.

In short, let me just say that to me, it sounds like
our government is telling us that freedom isn’t
really free. With all of these taxes it’s like we’re
paying alimony!

with an open mind (not as if one
were listening to a “nut case”) to
what Rabbi Kahane had to say

This article was some “tribute”
indeed! I would like to clarify
several issues in his letter, having
spoken personally with Rabbi
Kahane in the past.

Rabbi Kahane did not believe
that all Arabs should die. What he
did believe in was the right for a
Jew to defend himself. If the Arab
wished to live in peace under
Jewish law (i.e., with civil, but
not national rights) in the Jewish
state, then he was welcome. The
problem is that, understandably,
no self-respecting Arab would
want that. Given that situation,
the Arab then has two remaining
choices — move out of the Jewish

of their one tiny State. The Arabs
have chosen the latter course.
Since they have chosen to kill,

  Letters

any self-respecting Jew would
then be obligated to defend
himself and his land, killing if
necessary to survive. Therefore,
Mr. T atusko’s point about Rabbi

‘ Kahane setting up militantJewish

groups with the sole purpose of
defending themselves is correct

Furthermore, I fail to see how
anyone could listen directly and

and come away with the feeling
that he hated Arabs simply

' because they are Arab. Numerous

times he has wished them well,
in their own lands. The fact is that

he understood that the Middle I

Eastern culture is very different
from that of the West. I don’t
think even Mr. Tatusko, if he
were capable of defending
himself, would attempt to sit down
and chat in his own home with
someone holding a gun to his
headl...l

Season of anguish...

Hackett's

By Rob Mazur
Stat)“ Writer

It’s a tough job to take over the
reins of a major Division I-A
football program that is waning
from its past success and glory
and to restore the pride and honor
to a once-great gridiron power,
Throw in a young, inexperienced
team, and it turns into a tough,
discouraging first season. Such is
the case for University of
Pittsburgh head coach Paul
Hackett.

Having been an offensive
coordinator under some of the
best National Football League
coaches of all time (Bill Walsh
and Tom Landry‘) and having
coached some of the NFL’s most
productive quarterbacks in Joe
Montana, Danny White and Brian
Sipe, big things were expected
out of Paul Hackett when he

became the offensive coordinator
for then-head coach Mike

style offenseled the,Panthers to
one of the highest offensively
productive years since Dan
Marino’s tenure and also led them
to their first bowl victory since
the 1982 Sugar Bowl.

Gottfried fell under heavy

criticism last year by school
officials and was fired. A push
was made by the players to hire
Paul Hackett to be Gottfried’s
successor. Many even threatened
to transfer. In the words of then-
center Dean Caliguire, “If Paul
Hackett isn’t hired as head coach,
there is something seriously
wrong with the University of

Pittsburgh.”

So, Hackett was officially made
the head coach before last year's
John Hancock Bowl.
Immediately, fans and players
began speculating on the big
things to come this season.
Through all of this talk, Coach
Hackett maintained that people

should not overestimate his team.
Many seniors, who had played a
vital role in the Panthers’ success,
had been lost.

The ability of the team to exceed
last season’s goals depended on
the ability of the current personnel
to step forward and "Raise the
Level” — this year’s battle cry.

Brian Ku biak/The Pitt News
Coach Paul Hackett has been forced to use walk-onslike fullback Lance Markel (40) in major roles this year.

The current players have not
stepped forward and shown the

ability to take the team to bigger-

and better things. In fact, they
have gotten worse. Much worse.
3-6-1 worse. However, the players
are not totally to blame for this
regression. Injuries have
decimated the defense this year,

debut produces disappointing results

producing unlikely starters
midway through the season. This
would not have posed too big a
problem if Pitt had played teams

such as Boston College during ‘

that stretch. But the Panthers
played a strong Louisville team,
Notre Dame and longtime rival
West Virginia, which all left the
Panther defense looking as if it
was standing still.

To make matters worse, the

I I offense hit the skids at the same

time. With the defense as banged
up as the winner of a demolition
derby, the last thing Coach
Hackett needed was for his
offense to go south. But it did,

' and the rest, as they say, is history.

“I never dreamed of my first
season being this tough,” said
Hackett. “We got a lot worse

, today against Temple. You saw a

live Temple team and a comatose
Pitt team. I thought that the Miami
game was the bottom, but I guess
it wasn’t. The only place we have
to go from here is up. We can’t
get any lower.”

One theory was about the level
of play sinking since Pitt’s tough
loss to No. 1 Notre Dame. “Notre
Dame is our bowl game,” said
Hackett. “It has all the makings of
one. It’s a sellout crowd. It’s on
national television, and they are
highly ranked.”

Hackett now admits that_

perhaps he made a_ mistake in
making that big of a deal out of
one game. , .

has happened to our football.

Volleyball team wins two of three matcloes at State College

By Linda Holley
Staff‘ Writer

After a disheartening loss to the Penn
State Lady Lions, the Pitt women’s volleyball
team remained on top this weekend at the
Penn State Tournament, making its overall
record.27-5.

The Lady Panthers fell in three games to
Penn State on Friday, 15-1, 15-7, 15-6, but
returned to the court Saturday, ready for a
win.

Pitt went a grueling five games with
Texas-Arlington, 16-4, 11-15, 15-13, 13-15,
15-13, and William and Mary, 15-3, 14-16,
15-11, 6-15, 15-11, defeating both
opponents to maintain its 18th-place
position in the national rankings and to
stay tied for fourth place in the region.

Losing to Penn State is always hard for
Pitt to swallow, but Pitt head coach Sue
Woodstra had only good things to say
about the Lady Lions.

“They play well in all areas of the game,”
she said. “Any team that hits 80-plus balls
and has only four errors is doing something
right.” Penn State is ranked among the top
10 teams in the nation.

Woodstra believes that Friday’s loss

I showed how injuries were affecting the

team. Ann Marie Lucanie, who had been
outwith an ankle injury, returned to play

this weekend. She had been a starting
hitter at the beginning of the season.

Outside hitter Linda Zols believes Pitt
played better than the last time it faced off
against PSU. “lBut] it just wasn’t enough,”
she added.

Play was intense Saturday, with the two
matches lasting five and a half hours.

‘‘It came down to a mental game at the
end,” said Zols. ‘‘It was a test to see who
could hang on the best.”

Woodstra was concerned about the
team’s inconsistent play. “We played very
streaky—up for 15 minutes and down for
five.”

Senior co-captain Jenelle Lantagne and
Zols were praised by Woodstra for
emerging as leaders during the tournament.

Zols was named Big East Player of the
Week for Nov. 5 after her performance
against Seton Hall, when she had nine
kills, to raise her hitting percentage to
.562.

“She’s a solid player. She works hard
and pushes herself. It’s a lot of pressure
playing on the left side -— usually getting
the last chance to set the ball —— and I was
glad to see her get recognized,” said
Woodstra on Zols’ honor. '

after plays against Temple

After a penalty, the scoreboard
ﬂashed “Flag Day,” and after a
play without any illegal activity it
said, “And no ﬂags.”

Coach Hackett realizes that his
team is receiving far too many
penalties. He doesn’t blame them
on the officials, however.

“Starting this week, we are
going to hire an official to be in
practice and call us when we do
something wrong. We are going
to continue this practice for as
long as I'm at the University of
Pittsburgh.”

While Hackett has had a very
tough first season as head coach,
this is not uncommon.

Who remembers a certain NFL
coach who came to town and
took over a perennial loser and
won four Super Bowls a decade

V later? _

“Whenyou start a new program,
you can’t build it completely
overnight. It takes time. We’ve
had a lot of changes. It just takes
a while to get used to the new
system, " said Hackett. “It's been a

humbling experience but also an
educational experience. It's
definitely not what I wanted.
However, it’s really been an eye-
opener.

“We've seen some things where
we’re weak, like the injury
situation. All that we can do is
learn from it and work hard to
make sure it doesn’t happen
again.”

Hackett is not planning on
losing all the time but feels that
losing should be channeled into
a way to learn from it and begin
to want to win again.

“I called time-out at the end of
the game so that the players
could just feel the defeat, and I
told them that on the sideline,”
said Hackett, “If you don’t feel
the defeat and hate it and never
want to lose again, then you will
never get better. '

“If you feel it and you do
something, then it’s a learning
experience. If you lose and you
don’t change, then it’s an
afternoon wasted.”
