Leon Falk Family Presents
Old Shadyside Academy

University oﬂicials today announced the acquisition  the old
Shadyside academy building and grounds, a gift from the family of the

hte Leon Falk.

The property, long a landmark in the Shadyside section of the
city, is a three and one-half acre plot, bounded’ by Ellsworth avenue,
Morewood avenue, Bayard and Amberson streets. The buildings include
two connection brick structures, one two and one-half stories high and

Pre-Meds, Dents

Ollered Course
Chemistry

Pre-medical and pre-dental stu-
dents will be offered a special in-
tensive course in organic chemistry
beginning May 25.

The Schools of Medicine and
Dentistry are planning to admit
students early in 1943, Dr. Stanton
3. Crawford, dean of the College
announced.

Students who are now freshmen
and who hope to be admitted to one
of these professional schools at that
time face a problem of including
the necessary sophomore science
courses in the summer and fall sem-
esters, he explained.

“With the opportunity of getting
the first half of the organic chem-
istry course before the beginning of
the summer semester the student’s
diﬁiculty in fulﬁlling these require-
ments is solved,” Dr. Crawford
said.

“The special course will also be
of value to sophomore pre-dental
students from this and other schools
who may not have included the re-
quired organic chemistry course in
ﬂieir schedules and who expect to
enter the School of Dentistry in
July, 1942,” he added.

Robert H. Steiner, graduate stu-
dent assistant in chemistry, will
teach the course. Registration will
be conducted at the first class meet-
ing on May 25.

Pitt oﬂicials said that the prop-
erty is needed by the University
and will be a valuable addition to
Pitt. Play ﬁelds surrounding the
structure, they said, are needed for
physical education and recreation-
al activities.

For the last two years the Uni-
versity has been using the build-
ings, under a lease from Shady-
side academy,’for Engineering, Sci-
ence, and Management Defense
Training courses, offered in coop-
eration with the United States gov-
ernment, and for the department
of physical education. -

It is expected that the property
will be used as a quadrangle for
dormitory purposes, but no deﬁnite
plans yet are under consideration.

The older part of the building
was built in 1895 and the newer
addition was constructed in 1900.
The building .contains 30 rooms
and a gymnasium.

the Board of Trustees.

Annual anti-tuberculosis cam-
paign, sponsored by the Men’s and
Women-’s Student Health services
and the Pitt News, begins today
for two weeks of free tests to Pitt
students.

First injections will be adminis-
tered today and be given tomorrow
and Wednesday in the Men’s Stu-
dent Health service, thirty-fourth
ﬂoor, and the Women’s Student
Health serviceolfice, 2809 Cathe-
dral.

“One minute; one drop” says Dr.
Carlson, director of Men’s Student
Health service, “and you can be
sure that you are not a victim of
tuberculosis, for the passing of a
previous test only means that you
did not have TB at that time."

Students will be required to re-
portback within 48 hours after the
ﬁrst injection to have the results
observed. Following this, an injec-
tion of increased strength will be
given April 21, 22, and 23.

If the result of either test is posi-
tive, as’ will be the case of about 60
per cent of those who take the test,
it will indicate the presence of the
tubercular germ. After this the sec-
ondary test, x-ray is the only sure
way to detect the presence of tuber-
culosis.

Costtoﬂhe‘ student for the x-ray
will be $2.00, the cost of the ﬁlm.
Each year, the x-rays show that a
few persons have contracted the
disease. -

Medical School

By McEllroy-A

How the University’s School of

Medicine will schedule its. acceler-
ated program was revealed today
by Dr. William S. McEllroy,’dean.

Operating on a 12-month basis
for the duration, the School will ad-
mit and graduate a class every nine

vided into three trimesters of eleven
weeks each.

The ﬁrst session under the new
plan will begin July 6, and will end
sometime in March, 1943.

There will be no increase in en-
rollment nor any lessening of re-
quirements, Dean _McEllroy ex-
plained. Neither will the curricu-
lum be altered in regard to work
covered or subjects taken.

BULLETIN!

Saturday morning-.-l0:50 o'clock. Soldiers’ and A
Sailors’ Memorial hall auditorium has been already '

rented for next Wednesday and will not be available
for student elections. This was discoveredthrough
a routine check-up of election plans by the Pitt
News. Persons in charge of rental of Memorial hall
told the Pitt News that there was "little possibility"
of the University's getting the hall for election pur-

poses. Having assumed that the hall would be avail- .

able, SFA executive committee must, according to
Ed Tait,_ SFA president, meet Monday to decide
what to do. It may work out that SFA now will de-
cide to accept the plan of the Student-Faculty-
Administration Advisory committee on student elec-
tions, to hold the voting in the Cathedral, in State
hall, and in the Dental school. Any disagreement
between this bulletin and the election story and edi-
torial is due to our having no knowledge of the hall’:
being ‘rented at the time they were written and set
into type. ‘

By mwm nos:-1N _

There is going to be another general election held Wed-
nesday.

Since the Student-Faculty-Administration Advisory
Committee on Student elections recommended that polling
places‘ be set up at advantageous spots on campus, in order
to facilitate the expression of student opinion, it is probable
that the voting will take place in the Cathedral, in State hall,
and in the Dental school.

Students, however, must be prepared to vote either at’

one of the above named places or at Soldiers’ and Sailors’
Memorial hall, since it still remains for SFA executive com-

mittee to ratify and accept the recommendations of the ad--

Identiﬁcation cards will be required for Wednesday's elections.

All students must present them in order to receive a ballot. As a"

measure to insure against double voting, this time identiﬁcation cards
will be collected after the student has ﬁnished ﬁlling out his ballot.
They will, of course, be returned later.

visory committee, which it is probable that they will do. ‘
Wednesday's Pitt News will carry the complete infor-
mation as to_ where the e1e..ctions.wi1l be conducted.

 

Lasti‘Frid'ay, following attempts of fraternities to stall‘ P P. ‘

for time—time to tighten up their political lines, and time to
wait for student interest in a re-vote to wane, the Student-
Faculty-Administration Advisory Committee, chairman of
which is Dr. Ben H. Williams, offered its recommendations
for re-election plans in its report to SFA executive commit-
tee, the group which empowered it to act. . '
Set up by the offices of the dean of men and the dean of
women as an impartial group to decide on a plan of action
following Independent charges of fraud at the recent election,
the advisory committee decided on its recommendation after

a long session Friday afternoon. ’

The report submitted to SFA follows:
“It is our recommendation that three polling places be
set up:
d 1. In one of the Dental school buildings for Dental stu-
ents. '
2. In State hall for Engineering and Mines students.
d t3. In the Cathedral of Learning for other eligible stu-
en s.

We make this recommendation for the following rea-
sons: '

1. It makes the expression of student sentiment at the
polls easier.

2. It appears to be practical of administration.

3. It is in accord with general practice in American
elections to make voting places accessible to voters.

We further feel that the American and the University

of Pittsburgh ﬂags should be displayed at each polling place '

to symbolize the responsibilities and privileges of American

and University citizenship.” c,,,,,;.,,,,,g 0,, 9,3, 4

In order to determine the ration
of sweet to swing numbers the dan-
cers want Jarrett to play, the
dance publicity committee will op-
erate a poll today throughout the
campus.

During the intermission, a “boo-
gie-woogie" piano contest will be
held. All students who wish to
compete should sign the entrance
blank on the Owl office bulletin
board; in 835 Cathedral.

Favors will consist of wrist cor-
sages of gardenias and the decora-
tions will be “fountains of ﬂowers"
according to Ed Byers, C43, dance
chairman.

A ticket booth will be set up on
the ground ﬂoor today. Tickets
will be sold through Friday and

and the interfraternity sweepstakes
will take place.

V With the opening of another
 baseball season set for this Satur-
:_:f day afternoon, the outlook for an-
” other successful diamond record is
5: ‘far from bright. The practice ses-
sions held up to now reveal that
the Panthers will ﬁeld a good de-
fensive outﬁt against Bucknell, but
offensively they will leave much to
be desired.

Coach Ralph Mitterling had en-
tertained hopes of another good
year this season. However, the un-
expected loss of such key men as
Bob Malloy, Guy Guaclagino, and
Edgar Jones, all of whom supplied

has left the current Pitt baseball
entry without a concentrated at-
tack.

The way things shape up now the
inﬁeld will show Johnny Brown at
ﬁrst, Ed Fisher guarding second,
Johnny Vaiksnor on short, and
Fred Wilner holding down the hot
corner. The possible first string
outﬁelders at this writing‘ are
George Jacobs, Bill McCullough,
Herb Feldstein, Aldo Icardi, and
Jim Delong.

Either Joe Wilk or Carmn
_Ranii will pitch the opener, while
the other half of the battery is still
undecided. Finding a suitable catch-
er has been Mittei-ling’s biggest
problem besides the weakness in
hitting displayed by the team. '
Art Bariska, who had been
counted on for first string ._duty,
hurt his leg in one of the opening
practice drills and is out for the
remainder of the season probably.
Last week George Zukas, the ten-
tative number two receiver twist-
ed his angle, and will not be able
to play on Saturday.
Thus the -catching assignment
falls to Harry Abramovitz, who is

       

JOHNNY BROWN
reaches for high one

the punch for last season's team, ‘

,Phi Delts Win All-Campus

a better than average slugger, but
who has a very weak throwing arm.
If he were able to control his throw-
ing a little more he would probably
be the starting catcher without the
-benefit of injuries.

Another possible aid to Mitter-
ling in his quest for hitters is ﬁrst
sacker “Lefty" Brown. Last sea-
son he had a terrible season with
the willow, but is capable. of doing
much better. This writer has seen
him play sandlot ball for the past
two seasons and has watched him
drive the ball high and far on many
occasions. What caused his down-
fall at the plate last year is a mys-
tery for he really can hit.

In preparation for the opener
this weekend Mitterling put the
team through its ﬁrst nine inning
practice game last Saturday. Up
to this point only ﬁve and six in-
ning aifairs had been played.

Meet; Phi Eps Runner-Up

Already crowned Initerfrateinity
- champion, Phi Delta Theta once
again proved their strength and
power by capturing the all-Campus
swimming meet at the Trees pool
last" Thursday for the ﬁrst time in
the history of their house.
—The Phi Delt mermen took'three

places and two seconds as they

  
   

up a total of thirty points to
ce far ahead of a. powerful Phi
in the

runner-up ‘position with nineteen

Ep crew which ﬁnished

tallies.

The most surprising pa.rt of the
meet was the total collapse of the
Independent forces.’ Winning the
title last season, the Independents
were expected to. present another
strong group of aquatic sta1's. How-
ever the best the Independents were
able to do against the powerful fra-
ternity teams was a second place in
two’ events. ‘

Swimming the 40-yard back

" stroke._Pomy Fountain placed sec-

ond-_to._-Bob Smith, ’PiKA freshman.

This-. second place, coupled with

that of the 80-yard relay team,

gave the Independents fourth place
with nine points.

‘_‘once again it was the relay
teams“ that were the mainstays of
the. Phi Delt attack as both the
120 medley and the 80-yard free
style squads copped their events

with comparative ease. Doyle
Rhoades also contributed heavily to
the Dithridge St. boys’ cause. Be-
sides being a member of winning
free' style relay team, Rhoades cap-
tured first place in the 100-yard
free style event.

Top honors for the best individ-
ual performance of the day went to
Herby Venzer. The Phi Ep fresh-
man has been more or less of a one
man team all season and‘ last
Thursday’s meet proved to be no
different. Venzer won the 40-yard
free style and placed a close second
in Individual Medley Relay and the
40-yard breast stroke event.

In this last event, Herby was de-
feated by Vety Shulness, Engineer-
ing star, who ﬁnished half a stroke
ahead of him.

80,000 men per year will be accepted under _

this new plan. If you are between the ages
of 17 and 19 inclusive and can meet Navy
physical standards, you can enlist now as an
Apprentice Seaman in the Naval Reserve.
You will be in the Navy. But until you have
ﬁnished two calendar years, you will remain

"in college, taking regular college courses
under your own professors. Your studies‘

will emphasize mathematics, physics and
physical training.

After you have successfully completed 1%
calendar years of work, you will be giyen.a
written examination prepared by the Navy.
This examination is competitive. It is de-
signed to select the best men for training as
Naval Officers.

How to become an Officer

If you rank sufficiently high in the examina-
tion and can meet the physical standards,
you will have your choice of two courses
-—each leading to an oﬂicer’s commission:

1. You may volunteer for training as an
Aviation 0/ﬁcer. In this case you will be per-
mitted to ﬁnish at least the second calendar
year of your college work, after which you
will be ordered to active duty for training
to become an officer-pilot. Approximately
20,000 men a year will be accepted for
Naval Aviation-

2. Or you will be selected for training as a
Deck o_r Engineering Oﬁicer. In this case you
will be allowed to continue your college

work until you have received your degree.‘

After graduation you will be ordered to active
duty for training to become a Deck or En-
gineering Oﬁicer. Approximately 15,000 men
a year will be accepted.

If you do not qualify for special ofﬁcer’s
training, you" will be allowed to ﬁnish the
second calendar year of college, after which
you will be ordered to active duty at a Naval
Training Station as Apprentice Seaman.

Those who fail to pass their college work
at any time may be ordered to active duty
at once as Apprentice Seamen.

Your pay starts with active duty.

Here’s a real opportunity. A chance to
enlist in your country’s service now without
giving up your college training . . . a chance
to prove by that same training that you are
qualiﬁed to be an officer in the Navy.

Re-election . . .

Qontinued from page OIC

When notiﬁed of the rec-
ommendation of the advisory
committee to hold elections
at various locations throughout
the campus, SFA president Ed
Tait immediately set into motion
plans for an executive commit-
tee meeting of SFA, to decide
whether to accept the recom-
mendations of the Student-Facub
ty-Administration Committee, or
to insist upon the plans previous-
ly drawn up for election by the
executive committee of SFA.

SFA executive committee’s.plans
ll for, among other things, elec-
ons at “the usual place-Memo-
ﬁal hall.”
Executive committee, consisting
. S ﬁve fraternity members and one
Edependent, drew up the follow-
g election plans:
5. 1. There shall be at all times
) representatives from both parties
at the polls, endeavoring to main-
tain equality in numbers between

‘ 1 the parties.

A. Leaders of both parties shall
be responsible for supplying the
; watchers.
1 B. Watchers shall be from the
l junior and senior classes and shall
not be a candidate for any office.
i C. Lists of watchers from both
; groups must be submitted by Tues-
day to the elections committee for
final approval.
2. Elections shall be held at the
V usual place—-Memorial hall from

- 9 o’clock to 5:30 o’clock.

3. Student identiﬁcation cards

i shall be initialed‘ with crayon at

the time of voting for SFA nomi-

nees, and as the voter enters the
booth.

! 4. All identiﬁcation cards shall
be collected by the watchers at the
Men’s Council booth and may be
called for later at the ofﬁces of
the dean of men and the dean of

Women.
5. Watchers shall not enter the
booths at any time. *’
‘ 6. There shall be no proxy vot-
ing.
7. A complete identiﬁcation

card, stamped for the second sem-
S ester 1941-42 is required.
8. There is to be no electioneer-
I ing inside the polling area.
4 9. No loitering shall be allowed
within the polling area.
A 10. The three-minute rule will
be enforced.
as -as as
in short:
Since the impartial advisory
ﬂommittee on student elections, cre-
ted by the deans of men and wom-
W1 recommended that elections be
eld inlthe Cathedral, State Hall,
ﬁnd the Dental school, these will
host likely be the polling places.
tudents must be prepared to vote,
ither in one of these places or in
emorial hall,’ however, should fra-
rnity dominated SFA executive
mmittee decide to ignore the rec-
mmendations of the advisory com-

Summer Plans Announced l

The School of Education will
take part in the accelerated sum-
mer program by offering a six
weeks course, to be preceded and
followed by two week sessions. An
evening session will also be offered.

Though the above program is
only the usual summer schedule
for the School of Education, it is
timed so that a student may ac-
celerate a full semester by taking
the required education subjects
during the first two weeks and sup-
plement them with the required
courses offered during the second
six months of the College session.

Students wishing to take a full
semester schedule of 15 credits
were cautioned by Einar W. Jacob-
sen, dean of the School of Educa-
tion, to indicate their plans at reg-
istration for the ﬁrst six weeks
session, this in order to comply
with state regulations.

Students in the School of Edu-
cation will be limited to 12 credits.

s s as

To permit law students to ﬁnish
part or all of their courses before
entering the military service, the
School of Law will again offer a
summer term.

E. A. Gilmore, dean of the

School of Law, announced today '

that the 13-week summer session
will begin June 11 and end Sep-
tember 9. lt will be divided into
two terms of six and one-half
we-,ks each.

Beginning students may enter in
June, September, or February.

“A student beginning his law
study in June of this year may
complete the ﬁrst year’s work by
the end of January, 1943,” Dr. Gil-
more explained. “By attending six
successive sessions a student may
complete the three year course in
two calendar years. Students who
do not wish to accelerate their
studies may continue to complete
the course in the reghlar three aca-
demic years.”

New students entering the Pitt
school in June are required to sub-
mit applications and statements of
pre-legal statements training as
soon as possible.

Most of the students in the Col-
lege as well as incoming freshmen
are expecting to return for the
summer semester.

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean
of the College, today announced
this result of the survey made dur-
ing the January registration and
from conferences with College stu-
dents. ,

“From all indications a majority
of college students plan to return
to the campus for work in the sum-
mer semester,” Dr. Crawford said.

“Hundreds of courses will be
available’ in the College. These in-
clude both courses required by
freshmen and sophomores, and also

the electives needed by upper class‘-
men."

“I anticipate that the new fresh-
men class will be about equally di-
vided between the group entering
in J une and the group entering in
September. The freshmen entering
the University in June, 1942, will
be able to graduate in February,
1945,” he concluded.

At present one-third of the Col-
lege students are women and Dr.
Crawford expects the same division
between men and women during the
summer.

The maximum number of credits
which can be carried during the
summer is 18, but not all students
will be able to arrange their sched-
ule to carry this number of credits,
he said.
