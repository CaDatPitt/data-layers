Dr. Ferguson To Retire

By DONNA CONSIDINE

Originally a music major
intent on becoming a pianist,
Dr. John Ferguson was side-
tracked into 30 years of teach-
ing economics, a career which
will end with retirement this

August.

He made the switch from mu-
sic after receiving his bachelor
of arts degree at Harvard be-
cause Columbia University of-
fered him a three year fellow-
ship in the ﬁeld of economics.

A write up in the 1948 Owl de-
scribes him as follows: “A profes-
sor in learning but a student at
heart is Doc Ferguson.” . . . . . . 

“Pitt’s Mr. Chips,” as he has
beeh dubbed by local newspapers,
was thus cited by the yearbook
for his frequent attendance at
student dances, sports events, and
other campus activities. He is

known more commonly to his stu-
4dents, however, as “Fergie.”

_ According to the retiring pro.-
fessor,’the students and papers I

OUTSTANDING—Mitchell Kozikowski was honored Thursday as

letter: “From the Tuck Shop
Gang, 1945,” which he admits
he prizes highly in spite of his
protests over too much public-
ity. ’

It was at Columbia that he
earned the degrees of master of
arts and of law and doctor )f
philosophy. He received a doctor
ate in jurisprudence from the
University of Leipzeig in Ger-
many and taught at Vassar for
two years before entering the air
corps in World War I.

Shot down without a parachute
between enemy and allied lines,
Ferguson suffered a broken back
from which it took about ten
years to recover. He spent these
years in travel'and study, ﬁnally
coming to Pitt in 1927.

Dr. Ferguson is now writing his
sixth book, a history of economic
thought. His ﬁrst book, “Land-.
marks of Economic Thought,"
traces the history of economic
thought from early Greece until
the present. It was translated into
Spanish; French, and German.
Another of his works dealt with

the, German railroad system.

Pitt Sports Editor
To Be Questi.on,e~d

Steve Butchock, 1956-57
Sports Editor of the Pitt
News, will be a guest of the
Pie Traynor-Jack H enry
Sports Show this evening on
radio station KQV at 6 p.m.

Butchock" has stirred controversy
with his column entitled “Uncer-
tainty l\/larks Pitt Grid Future"
which appeared in the May 20
issue of the News. In the contro-
versial article, Butchock predicted
that Pitt. football‘ prospects would
decrease in the next few years due
to Chancellor Edward H. Litch—

ﬁeld’s plan to raise . academic
standards here.
Immediately a f t e r b e in g

printed in the News, the article
became the topic of discussion
among football enthusiasts in
the district. Grid experts in the
City and surrounding area have
been divided in their opinions
on Butchock’s predictions thus
far.

On the KQV Sports Show to-
night Butchock, who is graduat-
ing next month from Business Ad-
ministration, will further present
his views on the subject as Tray-

. nor and Henry put their questions

to him.

- Curbstane Bandits

For the past several years the parking situation around
the Pitt campus has grown steadily worse. The cause of this
regular increase in parking difﬁculties seems to be the Traf-
ﬁc Planning Department of the City of Pittsburgh. Every

City with new regulations and newly ridiculous restric-
tions. ‘ »

which were marked “No Parking.” These signs were put
up after most of the students were already parked for the
day and attending classes. All were tagged and no excep-
tions were made by the City. When a protest was launched,
after most of the ﬁnes were duly paid, Public Safety Direc-
tor David Olbum said that all the signs were posted the
previous afternoon. The protests of the Pitt News and Stu-
dent Congress went unheeded.

Earlier this school year, after the University opened
the 200 car faculty parking lot, the Carnegie Library ordered
the park police to “crack-down” on the one—hour parking
facility on the diagonals in front of the library. The park
police now have a constant check on the cars parked on
the _-diagonals. Very often the diagonals are empty while
students, who must park for three or four hours at a time,
were forced to drive around and around waiting for the
one—in-a-million chance that someone would move from
the Plaza’s no—time—limit parking areas. P e

The area in front of the Information Booth in the Plaza

- will hold four sports cars——and there are plenty at Pitt-

“No Parking.” This was recently enforced for the ﬁrst time
in four years. There is no conceivable reason for this re-
striction. ,

And now, on top of all the outrages done to students,
the City has put one and two—hour parking meters in along
a two—block area and down Forbes Street they have in-
creased the number of meters and reduced the size of each
space while modern cars get longer and longer.

- This protest will be mailed to the Mayor, to Safety Di-
rector Olbum and to the City Council. It Will’also go un-
heeded. After all, someone has to pay for the hundreds of
gallons of yellow paint for restricted parking areas. It
might just as well be the students since they are receiving

By Murray Chass

Excitement, heartbreak, and hard work were
plentiful during the recent Spring Carnival. The
unusual increase in the amount of these three was
due mostly to the opening night wash—out.

The violent wind and rain storms that struck
only an hour -before Miss Metropolitan was to have

’cut the ribbon to get the 1957 Carnival under way
caused temporary dip in the .
spirit of the students involved.
But the Pitt men and women
showed that they had that great
comeback V drive when they
cleaned up the destruction and
immediately set about to pre-
pare once again for the Carnival
opening.

This display of “esprit de
corps” should have convinced
onlookers of two points. First, groups of students
can work together tirelessly for a certain goal they
want to reach, and second, it takes something such
as Carnival to bring this out. ‘

Actually, these students have just two events
in the school year during which they are able to
express their combined ‘competitive efforts. There
is Homecoming in the Fall semester, and of course
Carnival in the Spring.

With so ,many new features expected to be in-
troduced or caused by the new administration and
its “new era,” such as a three—semester academic
year, a rise in tuition, and a decr_ease in Pitt foot-
ball power, there is no reason why a rumor con-
cerning Carnival should not be passed around.
Carnival Rumor

This latest rumor which was a popular topic
of conversation _with students during Carnival has
it that certain administrators have hinted their
dislike for the Spring gaiety. In other words, the
students seem to feel that come May, 1958, there
will be no more Spring Carnival.

Although neither Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld or Dr. Charles H. Peake, assistant chancellor
of Student Affairs, were available for comment on
this so—called rumor, two high—ranking oﬁicials
have expressed their individual opinions of Carni-
val. ’ ..

Dean of Men, Theodore W. Biddle, and Dean
of Women, Helen P. Rush, both agree that Car-
nival is a good idea. Dean Biddle started his com-
ments off by saying, “The students need an out-
ing program such as this. It gives them an op-
portunity to perform and show their originality.
Yes, I can support Spring Carnival.”

Dean Rush stated, “I think it is good to have
a fun celebration.”

Needs Time Reduction

They both feel, that Carnival is carried to
extremes. “I think we go overboard in our en-
thusiasm for it,” said Mr. Biddle. “We go over-
board in our competition with others and in our

wish to do well. Too much time and effort is spent
on it.”

Just The Facts

   
 

On Carnival

 

throng

When asked how he would suggest cutting down
the length of Carnival, thereby reducing the amount
of time students would have to put in on it, the

Dean said that the controls the students themselves V

would exercise would be better than anything the
University could do. As an example he pointed out
that the ﬂoat parade, which previously was a part
of Festival, this year was woven into Homecoming
instead.

Dean Rush oﬁered her reasonsas to why she
thinks Carnival is too stretched out. “It takes
more time than students can afford to give, es-
pecially at that time of the year. The seniors have
their ﬁnal papers to write, and it is difﬁcult for
the new freshmen because they are preparing to
take ﬁnal examinations for the ﬁrst time.

“‘If it were less elaborate, thesame end-prod-
ucts, fun and proﬁts, could be achieved.‘ With Car-
nival as it is now, the enthusiasm tends to be
spread among a more limited group. Some stu-f,
dents have told me that they would like to Work
on it, but can not because of the extensive time
they would have to spend.

“With these limitations, Carnival should go
on,” she concluded. .

Wider Participation I

At this point, once again both Deans agree on
another possible ,and very logical, alteration in
the Spring festivities. -“Somehow or other we must
develop other things for students not in fraterni-
ties and sororities,” the Dean of Men commented,
“These people comeinto it only as spectators and
customers. A higher percentage of the student
body has to become developers and promoters in
Carnival.”

’Miss Rush did not stop with saying that more

students should participate in it; she speculated ,
as to how it could be done. “We could turn Car-' I

3'7‘

 

nival over to the four classes and let each one

have a show. If they would want to put on more
shows, let them. The fraternities and sororities

have their Homecoming days when they decorate ,

their houses. Let them compete for members—-
that’s all right. But it becomes problematic when
they try to take over everything else.”
Class Spirit .

Then she returned to the explanation of her
Carnival plan. “We would like to build up class
spirit, and this would be a perfect way. They
could have parades with banners and other suclri,
items. We could build a little bit of the spectacu-7%‘
lar around the classes,” she explained as she her-
self became somewhat enthusiastic.

“The ‘fraternities have their rituals and pins;
we could use these kinds of devices (banners, etc.)
to build up the class spirit.”

Thus, two of the University’s oiﬁcials who are
close to the students are in accord on the subject
of Carnival: it should continue, possibly, with a
few alterations. \Anyway, the rumor about Car-
nival is just a rumor. As long as some high-ranking
members of the administration are in favor of
Carniva1’s continuance, there seems to be no im-
mediate danger of it being otherwise.

The Lion and The Throne by
Catherine Drinker Bowen, will
cenrtainly satisfy every reader
who has had enough in the all
too common marriage of fact
with ﬁction and who longs for
simple, unadulterated historical
accounts, together with the an-
alysis aifd interpretation which
a novel would contain. The vol-
ume itself deals with the career
‘of Sir Edward Coke, Attorney
General under Queen Elizabeth
and Chief Justice under James I‘.
The accounts cover the time
from the reign of Queen Eliza-
beth to Charles I in relation to
Coke, who “surpressed the con-
spiracies against Queen Eliza-
beth and fought for the Com-
mons against James I and Char-
les I.”

quately acquainted herself with
the material to be presented.
The volume’s excellence, how-
ever, lies not only in the mater-
ial itself, but in the way this
material is presented. Miss Bow-
en’s presentation has escaped the
gaudiness which would have re-
sulted in a blending of ﬁction
with fact; it has portrayed .Sir
Edward Coke as the infallible
hero of the novel but as a man,
subject to human weakness as
well as its greatness; it has en-
compassed and developed a View
broad enough to express both
sides in the struggle of two fac-
tions in 16th and 17th century
England —- that of the crown
and that against the crown.
One realizes what a ﬁne por-
trayal is that of Sir Edward
Coke. First of all, it is syste-
matic. It gives in respective or-

Ritenour has asked the News to make it clear
that the Fedreal Service Entrance Examination is
designed to recruit non-technical personnel for any
job in the U. S. Civil Service which a Liberal Arts
College Graduate can perform. There is a wide
variety of positions open to those who qualify

In Health Building;
Invites Browsing
" By GARY STEIN

In his speech earlier this
year to the student body Dr.

Edward Litchﬁeld spoke of
the “New Era” at Pitt and

how his new administration?

would try to improve the

academic standards and student

facilities of the school. ‘
Among the many improvements

the Chancellor had in mind was 7

the development of a new book

store for the University. He told 
the assembly, consisting primarily ‘

of students, that the book store
of a great University should do
more than distribute required text
books;
intellectual curiosity among the
students.

While the Chancellor was
speaking to the undergraduate

schools, work was being done on‘

a similar bookstore in the School
of the Health Professions. This
new ultra-modern bookstore, now
completely ﬁnished and in opera-
tion, was officially opened to the
professional schools last Febru-
ary 15. .

VALEDICTORY "

Wlith this column I complete my third year of writing
for Philip Morris.

It has been my custom in the ﬁnal column of each
year to forego any attempts at humor, because you, dear
‘readers, have had your funnybones so frozen by the cold
wind of impending ﬁnal exams that it is futile to try to
get a laugh out of you; and because in this last column
of the year we are saying goodbye, and goodbyes are
occasions for sweet solemnity, not slapdash foolery.

Today my heart is full. I am grateful, first of all, to
the Philip Morris Company who make this column pos-
sible. They have given me a completely free hand in the
choice of subject matter; they have not tampered in any
way with my copy; they have been unfailingly courteous
and helpful. I wish to take this occasion to extend heart-
felt thanks to the makers of Philip Morris for their most
touching kindness, and to notify them that if we renew
our association for another year, I shall require a sub-
stantial increase in salary.

Second, I should like to tender my thanks to you,
dear readers. A writer’s life is not an easy one. There
are an appalling number of hazards—a drought of ideas,
for one; catching your necktie in the roller of your type-
writer, for another—and when a writer is blessed, as I
have been, with an audience as alert, as bright, as intelli-
gent as you, dear readers, then he must take his hat in
his hand and his necktie out of the typewriter and humbly
give thanks. .

  

19réz’/225 /é'.7oer5. ’

This, dear readers, I now do. Thanks for being dgar.
Thanks for being readers. P «

Finally, I wish to thank the tobacconists of America
who make it possible for us to buy our Philip Morris
Cigarettes by the pack. If there were no tobacconists,

’we should have to buy our Philip Morrises direct from

the factory in boxcar lots. This would present grave
storage problems to those of us who live in dormitories
and other substandard dwellings.

I hope, by the way, that you have been to your tobac- 0

conist’s lately and bought some Philip Morris Cigarettes.
I have been trying to beguile you into smoking Philip
Morris Cigarettes, by means of What advertising men
call the “soft sell.” Indeed, I have occasionally gone
beyond the soft sell into the “limp” or “‘ﬂabby” sell. I
hope my pulpy merchandising has had its effect, for here
is an enchanting cigarette, pure, natural pleasure, a joy,
a jewel, a haven to the storm-tossed, a bower to the weary.
And in addition to being a haven, a bower, and all like
that, Philip Morris is a boon to the absent minded. No
matter which end you light, you’re right!

And so goodbye. Go in peace, go in content. May
good fortune attend your Ventures, may love and laughter
brighten the corners where you are. See you, hey.

©Max Shulman, 1957
ll’s been a great pleasure for us, the makers of Philip Morris,
to bring you this monument to the soft sell each week. Till

As Panthers Succumb to State

By HAROLD LEINER

The powerful Penn State golf team, who ﬁnished second
in the Eastern Intercollegiate Golf Association, defeated the
Panther golfers last Saturday, 5-2, in match play. 1

The loss was the second of the season for the locals and
they now carry a record of six wins and two losses into
the ﬁnal match with Duquesne. Navy, who won the E.I.G.A.,

was the bnly other team to defeat%

~-Cormack

the Panthers so far this season.

Ron Schwarzel, the sensa-
tional sophomore from Brent-
wood who was voted the most
valuable player on the squad
by his teammates, again was
the standout for the Blue and
Gold as he shot a two under par
67 to defeat the Lion ace Pat
Rielly by a single stroke. Bob
Hixon also played good golf for

the locals as he shot one under
par 68 to be the only other Pan-
their to register a victory.

The scoring in match play is
brought about as each golfer plays
individually against another one
for 18 holes andgthe player win-
ning the most holes scores one
point for‘ his team. Each team
uses seven golfers who attempt
to add points to their team’s score.

Coach Dave Mccormack hopes
to conclude the season with a vic-
tory over the Duquesne squad this
Wednesday which would make
the Blue and Gold’s record for the
season a successful 7-2.

Last season the locals ﬁnished
with a record of 6-4 and even if
they lose to the cross town
Dukes they would still finish
with a better record than last
year. 4

Flynn Places High
In NCAA Classic

James Flynn, - captain of the
Panther riﬂe team, has just been
named as the 34th best marksman
in collegiate competition after a
tabulation cf the various NCAA
regional tournament results across
the nation.

Last month at Buffalo, N. Y.,
Flynn ﬁred a 282 which was good
enough for second place in the
regional.

The ﬁnal tabulation of all the
NCAA regionals disclosed that the
Blue and Gold ace was 34th out
of 900 collegiate shooters.

Coach Joe Gromko was highly
pleased with the proliﬁc eye of
the Panther sharpshooter who was
voted the outstanding riﬂer by his
teammates at the fourth annual
All Sports Banquet of the Uni-
versity last Thursday.

Coach Gromko was also pleased
by the performance of the fresh-
man team which ﬁnished sixth
in the nationals.

except Joe Volanski our 7th man.”
The golfers that McCormack was
referring to were Schwarzel,
Wade Herpsberger, Hixon, Dave
Brown, and Bob White. ~

Penn State Netters
Blank Jungle Cats

In Season Finale

The Panthers traveled to Uni-
versity Park last Saturday after-
noon but found the" Nittany Lions
a little too tough as the Penn
Staters won every match to re-
cord a 9-0 decision.

This proved to
straight victory for the Keystone
Rivals against six defeats. The

Lions lost their ﬁrst six starts
before ﬁnding the victory trail.
The Jungle Cats closed out their
season with a 3-4 record, after
posting a 9-3 record last season.

The Staters in winning this
meet won every set except one in
both the singles and doubles. In
the singles, Bob Swany of Sky-
scraper U. won the ﬁrs.t set from
Charles Bibleheimer, 6-1, but then
faded in the next two sets 6-0 and
6-2 to lose the match. ‘

Fred Trust of State started
off the meet by defeating Bill
King of the Panthers in two
straight sets, 6-2 and 6-4. After
Swany dropped‘ the second
match, Don Isaac representing
the Blue and Gold lost a tough

be the ﬁfth

ﬁrst set by a 6-4 decision and V

then went on to drop the sec-
ond set, 6-2.

In the last three singles matches

the Nittany Lions had very little
trouble. Joe Galiardi proved too
strong for Neal Zweig as he won
two straight sets 6-1 and 6-2.
Bernie Ravish of the Blue and
Gold dropped two sets to Pete
Dedad 6-1, 6-3; as did Fred Bone-
brake, 6-0, 6-0, to Dick Jacobs of
State.

After losing six matches in the
singles events, the Panthers were
unable to. do any better in the
doubles with the Lions taking the
three. doubles on straight’ sets.

Well-Balanced Panthers

By ED KOLTISKA

Only four more practice days remain before Coach Carl
Olson’s thinclads close out their 1957 track season with an
attempt to place high in the IC4A meet this coming Saturday
in New York. For the ﬁrst time in four years, Coach Olson
will be taking a team to the IC4A’s that is betterbalanced
in potential point winners than in any of the other years.

The only drawback hindering the Panthers is the need
for individual winners. With the graduation of Arnie Sowell,
the Jungle Cats lost one of their best point getters. Sowell
won the 880 yard event three years in a row at the IC4A
meets.

The bright spot on the traveling squad is the mile
relay team comprised of Paul Thrash, Zinnerford Smith,
Dick Doyle, and Charles Heﬂin, ’Against Penn State,
this winning combination ﬁnished 40 yards ahead of the
Nittany Lions. ’

Filling in for the missing Sowell will be Jim Moore
and Wendell Harford in an attempt to continue the reign
in this event for the Blue and Gold. Moore, the co-captain
with Heﬂin, will also be entered in the mile or half—mi1e
events along with Vince Timon and Harford.

In the high hurdles, Bob Russell will try to pick up
some points in his initial performance in the IC4A compe-
tition. Thrash and Timon will make their bid in the low
hurdles. '

The Panthers will be well heeled in the sprint events

come Saturday. Both Herb Carperf and Jim Donahue will‘

taken the 100 on two occasions in 9.7 seconds with Carper
matching this feat only .once‘this past season. .
Moving over to the ﬁeld events, the Jungle Cats
will be a little stronger this year than last. Looking"
exceptionally well this season is Bill Smith in the pole
vault. Smith, undefeated this season, broke the stadium
record last year in dual meet competition with Penn
State with a height of 13 feet, 8 inches, ,
Added strength is Wesley King in the discus and shot-
put events. King, sophomore from Greensburg, broke the
Stadium record for the discus throw that has stood for the
past 30 years. His heave of 156 feet, 4’;é'inches surpassed
the old mark of 146 feet. Teaming up with King in these
two events will be Larry Och. Rounding out the ﬁeld events
are Smith, Heﬂin, and Templin entering in both the high
jump and broad jump. “ ' .

The High Spots ‘
Were Numerous .

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

 

If I had to sit down and select the outstanding performance
which gave me my greatest sports thrill during my four years of
writing for this paper, I do not think that I could do it for the
rapturous reason that every time a Pitt team triumphed it provided
me with a thrill. The sport, iwhether it was football, basketball,
wrestling, or track, did not matter. The importance was contained
inlthe fact that these teams represented the school I was attending
which was more than reason enough.

There are two instances, however, which I would like to men-
tion as far outstanding all others in a game Where one loses fame
much faster than he acquires it.

The first incident occurred during my sophomore year when
Arnie Sowell anchored the Panther mile relay team to a win
over the teams from Army and Ohio State in a triangular meet
at the Stadium. Sowell was just beginning to show signs of
developing into one of the ﬁnest middle distance runners in the
world. The indefatiguable and smooth-striding Arnie smashed
the barrier of greatness by covering the quarter-mile in a time
which bettered the world mark’.

SoWe1l’s time could not be recognized as a world record be-
cause it was registered in a relay which allows the contestant to
make use of a runningstart in the exchange of the baton. But wow!
He sure picked them up and put them down that day!

The second high spot ‘was the Pitt-Minnesota game at Minneapolis
last year where I also had the fortune of meeting one of the great-
est coaching celebrities in collegiate football history—-Bernie Bier-
man. Prior to the Panther-Gopher game there were many nostalgic
stories reiterated about the bruising games these two teams had
played during the -1930’s when Mr. Bierman had matched wit with
the late Dr. John Sutherland.

These stories were ones of awe, triumph, and pride. Hear-
ing all of these memories being retold the night before the game
caused me to wondr if the present-day teams would ever play a
game which 20 years hence would be viewed and talked about
caused me to wonder if the present-day teams would ever play a
the 1930’s. All apprehension of disappointment was dispelled the
next day when the Golden Panthers and the Golden Gophers
played the most rock blocking and tackling game I ever wit-
nessed.

Mr. Bierman, gray-haired and with wrinkles of victory and
defeat clearly visible, was sitting on the Minnesota bench. His
presence may have been insigniﬁcant, but it seemed to give the
‘Gophers an inspirational lift against Coach John Michelosen’s grid-
ders.

In two short seasons under Michelosen the Panthers had re-
gained their stature as a national power. The Panthers performed
«admirably before bowing, 9-6, on a last-minute field goal ‘to the
.team from the land of lakes and Indians. This was more than an
ordinary football game; it had too much of the past and the future
wrapped together,

Q. Future look pretty good there?

A. Great! They’ve expanded their engineering staff
seven times since 1945. And with all the new

their biggest growth yet. '

Q. What’s the bulk of their work-commercial or

defense?

A. I’d say commercial, for sure. They’re a leader in
\ business machines and data processing equip-
ment. And that means plenty of work in mechan-
ics, electro-mechanics and electronics. But they're

in the thick of defense work, too . . . that involves
