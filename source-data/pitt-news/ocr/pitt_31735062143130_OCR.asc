Blacklist Rule A-

Major changes in the academic
tenure of professors during the
last decade have erased the black
cloud of censure imposed on the
University administration in 1936
by the American Association of
University Professors.

At a conference in Boston, lV[ass.
last week-end, the association vot-
ed unanimously to reinstate Pitt
to the list 01? accredited univer-
sities. Dr. M. R. Gabbert, chair-
man of the University senate com-
mittee on academic freedom and
tenure represented Pitt at the an-
nual meeting.

The University was “blacklist-
ed” in 1936 for violation of the.
“principles of academic freedom’.’

At that time, it was charged.
that the University was not offer-
ing the academic freedom set up
in the standards of the AAUP.
Upon its recommendation, changes
were made in the school admin-
istration which resulted ir. lifting
the 11-year ban.

During the period of adminis-
tration censure, the status of pro-
fessors already at the University
as well as those entering the pro-
feSSl0l‘??Te here was 10l altered

Slow, Steady Progress Marks
University ’s 160 - Year History

Pitt’s star has not always beene

bright but it has risen higher in
the heavens‘ through 160 years.

The progression from a’ three-
room log cabin near Fort Pitt to
the Cathedral of Learning in met-
ropolitan Pittsburgh faltered but
never stopped.

On an evening in 1786, Hugh

Henry Brackenridge, graduate of
the College of New Jersey
(Princeton) and destined to be-
come a judge on the Pennsylvania
"Supreme court, gathered with 21
of the local pundits in Marie’s
tavern ‘to formulate plans f-or a
school that would take local youth
beyond the three R’s.
S Over their mugs of Mononga-
hela brew Brackenridge "and his
companions founded the Pitts-
burgh academy which was char-
tered by act of the state legisla-
ture on Feb. 28, 1787.

Believing that the title “Acad-
emy” was not in keeping with the
spirit of the institution, the di-
rectors in 1819 had the school re-
chartered as the Western" Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, a name
that survived for nearly a cen-
tury. ,, ’

The ﬁre that destroyed 20
blocks of -Pitts-burghin 1845 level-
ed the university. A new building
was constructed but this also
burned.

In 1855 the university moved
into a third building which show-
ed signs of permanency.

At Allegheny observatory, ac-
quired by WUP in 1865, Samuel
Pierpont Langley conducted re-
search which was to make him
“the father of aviation in Ameri-
ca.” ~

Cramped by an expanding busi-
ness district, the university moved
from the Golden Triangle to Per-
rysville avenue in old Allegheny
in the early 1880’s.

Members of Phi Beta Kappa-
on the instructional, adminis-
trative, and research staffs of
the University are urged to
attend, if possible, a luncheon
meeting in the small dining
room of the Faculty club at
12:30. p.m., Friday, March 7..

  
 

    

From a log abm an the shadow
of Fort Pitt to the Cathedral of
Learning in 160 years.

During the same decade the
school was relocated on Observ-
atory hill in the same district.

Suspicions of instability were
voiced when, in 1908, the name
was changed to the University of
Pittsburgh and the school packed
its educational wares and moved
to the Schenley Farms district in
Oakland.

Following the first World War
the University was over-supplied
with students but precariously low
on classroom space and "funds.

In this period of virtual crisis,

“How do high school and col-

Initiations and snow seem to

Tri Delts reached for the moon

two keys to Pinky Balquist and

also initiating Caryl Garman-—It
better be a good show since their

far the PiKA’s. Saturday after-

Sparkman from Alabama, national
president Packer, andhundreds of
actives and alumni from the Pitt,

chapters will be on hand to make
it the biggest affair in 'PiKA land.

DODO

CANTERNA

Pitt and its basketball mentor, Dr. Red Carlson, were deﬁn-
itely happy to welcome Dodo Canterna back from the war. Many
remembered that big night in 1944, when Dodo bucketed 37 points
against Westminster,
the Stadium ﬂoor.

Canterna was as modest and shy when a little shaver as he is
today at 20. At ﬁrst, he had no inclinations towards athletics, but
was practically pushed into it to uphold the family name. Dodo, the
youngest of six boys in the Canterna family,
watched his ﬁve older brothers ride to, fame at
Freeport high school and he was not to be outdone.

BEGINS AT EIGHT

.V He began his basketball career in the eighth
 grade at St. Mary’s grade school and continued
I , tossing them through the hoop at Freport high,
_" where he was a varsity letterman all four years.
Dodo also held down the shortstop post on the
baseball nine and the end slot on the grid squad.

After 18 months inithe Air Corps, Canterna was
released and he headed straight back to Pitt. He
. was in ﬁne physical trim,ihaving played basketball
at MacDill Field, Florida. While engaged in service competition, Do-
do_ became acquainted with’ George Senesky, a former’ great at St.

Practice drills begin Mon-

The workouts will serve a

Year Against WestpVa.  

Golightly

Pitt ’s cagers windup an 18-game schedule tomorrow night
when they oppose West Virginia at Morgantown.

It’s a. tough obstacle but

the Panthers will never have

a better opportunity to enhance their prestige. The Mountain-
eers have already tucked away a bid to the National Invitational

tournament on March 15.
It will mark the fourth time in

six years that West Virginia has

participated in the annual Madi-
son Square Garden event. They

‘copped the crown-in 1942.

The .high scoring Mountaineers,
who average’-~74 points per contest,
rank “ﬁrst in the East and second
in the nation. At home, they have
run-up a 27-game winning streak.

The Lee Patton—coached aggre-
gation has won 15 games and lost
one, which was a close decision
to _Navy at Annapolis.

Earlier‘ this month West Vir-
giniai was stymied for three quar-
ters before its superior manpower
overcame the. Panthers, 52-41.
Since then, Pitt has decisioned
Allegheny, Geneva, and West-

» minster.

Pitt needs this game to ﬁnish
the campaign at the .500 ‘mark.
They have won eight and lost
nine. Tomorr0W’s contest will
round—out four years of varsity
competition for Nate Apple, Pan-
ther captain. ' __

Pitt will have Apple and Bill
Cieply at the forwards. Ed Latag-

Y Court Team
Wins Twice

The Pitt YMCA basketball team
started, the second half of the
Metropolitan Y league season with

‘a bang. Led by Tony Razzano and

Leo Skladany, who have scored
97 points between them, the Pitt
team has copped two of its ﬁrst
three games. V '
The Y opened with a 54-36 win
over Coraopolis, lost one to the
ﬁrst—half champions, -.Allegheny,
61-57, and then bounced back to
beat Sharpsburg, 57-48, Pitt had
little trouble in trouncing Cora-
opolis and Sharpsburg. The tilt
with Allegheny was a thriller. Al-
legheny made four free throws in
the last 60 seconds to break ‘a tie.

All four fouls Were called against
Carl DePasqua of Pitt.

Razzano has been acclaimed as
the deadliest shot in the league
since his great performance
against Sharpsburg. In that con-
test he scored 23 points with 11-
ﬁeld goals and one foul. He now
has 55 points to his credit, slight-
ly less than 19 points per game.

For Meet W7ith
Slippery Rock

With revenge on their mind, the
Pitt aquatic team, coached by
Howard Waite, has been working
extra hours at the Trees pool in
preparation for their dual meet,
at Slippery Rock State Teachers
college on March 4. '

The Panthers suffered their on-

ly ‘defeat of the season when the ‘ 

Rockets visited the local pool in
January. ' ~
Much emphasis is being stressed

by Coach Waite on relay work,‘ .

since the free-style relay victory
by Slippery Rock was the decid-
ing factor in the future teachers’
win here January 28.

“The meet will be a tough one,”
the Jungle Cat coach predicts.
The Rockets are strong in many
of the positions in which the 10-
cals are weak. '

.* Past performances indicateithe

Pittites will probably take the 50-
and 100-yard free style, the back-
stroke, medley relay,.and' possibly
the 220—yard free style. Slippery
Rock is a favorite in the other
events of this dual meet.

Most of the work this past week.
has been devoted to conditioning.
Further stress hasvbeen placed on
improving form and improving
times.’

Tomorrow morning at 10 am.
the Panthers will meet Geneva

college in a practice meet at the 

Trees pool. This will be the Cove-
nanters’ ﬁrst competition of the
season. ‘
