Wherein Foster
Memorial As Dramatic
Arena Is Discussed

By OSCAR GOODSTEIN

\Vith Pitt‘ Players’ “Fresh
Fields” heralding the ap-
proach of the University enter-
tainment organizations’ season,
we are reminded that this yea.r
Foster Memorial will serve as
the home theater for these
groups. The entertainment
groups at the University may
be listed as Cap and Gown,
Men ’s and VVomen’s Glee
Clubs, the University Band,
and the Orchestra and the
Players. ‘

All of these feel that a home
theater such as the Foster audi-
torium will prove a distinct ad-
vantage over the set-up whereby
they had to give their perform-
ances off campus.

Smaller Rents . . .

There will be, for one thing,
smaller rental obligations—in fact,
rental fees will be limited to the
cost of ushers, lighting, and other
overhead expenses. Added _to
this, a “home” atmosphere sur-
rounding the performances will
make them more University of
Pittsburgh affairs.

Among the above named organi-
zations, there exists a feeling,
however, that the social room and
other facilities of the theater
should be opened, particularly to
them. They feel this, despite the
fact that an announcement was
recently made that these facilities
would not be opened to them.

Pitt Players, for instance, want
to offer dances to their group,
which by the way numbers some
200 people, and other guests who
attend their shows. Every year
the Men’s Glee Club follow their
home concert with an informal
dance affair.

C. Stanford Belfour, assistant
director of University Extension
division and of the Summer Ses-
sions, who represent the Univer-
sity control of the building, un-
derstands the need of the students
for an on-campus student union
house. He explained to this writ-
er that as such the Foster Memor-
ial is wholly inadequate.

A Student Union?

“Someday,” he said, “we hope
to erect a building that will be

.a complete student union house—
' containing rest and billiard rooms,

library, swimming pool, gym,
theater, and a home dance hall.
But until that day, we will have
to go along under the present con-
ditions; we cannot allow dances in
the social room to one or two
groups, because then even the
most inactive clubs on campus
would be knocking on our door to
ask for its use.”

This writer cannot help feeling,
though, that the entertainment or-

ganizations have a primary claim ‘

to the use of the dance hall in
conjunction with the use of the
auditorium.

The building is for entertain-
ment and for the entertainment
groups, why not for their adjunc-
tory social affairs?

The other activities will hardly
feel slighted when they consider
a ruling to that effect from this
angle. The administration would
not detract from the exclusiveness
of the Foster Memorial, nor from
the digniﬁed atmosphere sur-
rounding it by granting such per-
mission.

Club Welcomes

New Members

At their second meeting of the
year today, at 2:30 o’clock, in 126

Cathedral, the German Club will.

The afternoon business meet-

something of their life there.

Plays in German will be pre-
sented at some of the evening
meetings. According to Gertrude
Broido, C40, president of the club,
the members expect to have “Die

Women who are eligible for fall
rushing will be better able to
answer questions that might be
puzzling them, after they are ad-
dressed by several members of
Panhellenic Council to-day at
12:30 o’clock. This guidance meet-
ing will be held in the dean’s con-
ference room, on the eighth floor
of the Cathedral.

Instructions will be given to ad-

for women in the fall, the council
seeks to help the rushees make a
wise choice.

Technicalities of Rushing.” Betty
Batty, C40, will explain “The
Basis for Choosing a Fraternity.”
Following these talks, members of
the Council will answer all ques-
tions that the audience might ask.

Sunday, November 14, is the
date set aside for each fraternity
to entertain. Teas and informal
parties will be offered by the
groups so that they may become
better acquainted with the new
women, and so that those being
rushed will be better able to make
their decisions.

W assermann Tests
Arouse Interest

Dr. Jamison Hails Campaign
As Men’s, Women’s Health Services y

Continue E-Blood Examinations

By MELVIN ROGOW
immediate response to the story in Mon-
free VVassern1ann
. tests, the Men ’_s and Women’s Student Health Services are
going ahead, taking the blood tests for any University student.
Dr. Auleene Jamison, head of the Women ’s Student Health
Service, said yesterday, “I am very proud of the girls who have
been so prompt in responding to the notice in The News. It
shows a thoughtfulness on their part, as well as an acceptance

VVith an amazing
day’s News, regarding

of civic responsibility.

“The more people who respond to this call, the more likely
we are to catch that small per-¢

centage of positive reactions. Any
young woman who is looking for-
ward to a profession, homemak-
ing, or a. business career, can ﬁnd
adequate reason for waiting to
know positively whether she has
become an innocent victim of
syphilis.

“Our response here is merely
indicative of the unusual interest

. our girls take in.scientiﬁc activi-

ties which will help well-being.”
COOPERATE IN PLAN

The plan is being worked out
with the cooperation of the Stu-
dent Health Services, the City of
Pittsburgh’s Department of Pub-
li-c Health and The Pitt News. Dr.
H. C. Carlson, and Dr. Paul Zeh-
fuss are taking blood tests for the
men, and Dr. Jamison for the
women.

City laboratories are making the
analysis of the blood, under the
direction of Dr. I. H. Alexander,
head of the Department of Pub-
lic Health.

The campaign at the University
is being held in conjunction with
the nation-wide attack on syphilis.

DR. LANFEAR APPROVES

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, approves the tests as being
“most. beneﬁcial to public wel-
fare.” He said, “I would like to
see every University student take
the Wassermann tests being offer-

Ordinarily, the charge for such

$1. Dr. Alexander, who is chair-
man of the Anti-Syphilis League
in this city, made the statement
yesterday that due to the pres-

Panther Issues
Picture Book

Panther fans who are also in-
terested in pictures will have a
chance to follow an eight-picture
story appearing in this month’s
Panther, which appears on camp-
us today.

Bearing slight resemblance to a
certain national photo-news mag-
azine’s feature photo-stories, the
pictures will show the evolution
of the University yearbook, the
Owl.

“And besides this will have our
usual where-and-when c olumn
and our student index, which will
give the faculty the lowdown on
the students; and the women’s and
men’s fashion pages, featuring
eight freshman as models, and

rest of it to appreciate it; we have

man examination.

This test, one of science’s
most important strides, is sur-
prisingly simple.

Blood is taken from a vein
in the arm, by means of a
needle so sharp that it causes
scarcely any pain. A tourni-
quet is ﬁrst applied just above
the spot the needle is to enter.

When the needle enters the
vein, about 3 to 5 cc’s of blood
are drawn, not enough to make
any difference to the patient.

The main work of the test is
done after the patient leaves.
The blood must be analyzed,
and tested for positive or nega-
tive reactions.

University students could get the
tests free through the health ser-
vices.

place to start all educational cam-
paigns,” he said.

Pete Gimber To Lead
Pairs Through Steps
Of Big Apple Friday

. It seems l.ike a vicious circle,
but winners of the fancy-dress
contest at the Cap and Gown
masquerade, Friday, will be
awarded tickets to the Soph
Hop and the College Associa-
tion dance.

Other feature of dance will
be uninhibited rendition of Big
Apple led by Delt Pete Gimber,
credited with introducing the
craze to campus. Something will
be dug up for most efficient Big
Applers. According to Cavalier,
C38, dance chairman, Gimber do-
ing the big Apple is as the turning
of a worm.

Baron Elliott, beater-outer of
rhythms, will jam from 9 to 1
o’clock at the Twentieth Century
club, scene of the session.

Costumes will be judged for
originality and humor by compe-
tent observers. Names and com-
petency experience will be” given
in later issues.

Tickets, priced at $1.50, will ad-
mit two persons to the club and
entitle holders to enter all festivi-
ties. These may be purchased
from any member of Undergradu-
ate Cap and Gown club.

Spanos again wishes to deny the
report of 20 beautiful aides aiding
anybody at the dance.

Players Present ‘Fresh Fields’
In Foster Memorial Next Week

Comedy To Open
..  New Theatre
- Wednesday Night

 When Pitt Players bring their

"widely heralded comedy, “Fresh

Fields,” to the Stephen Foster the-
ater next Wednesday and Thurs-
day, the University will have two
good reasons to go.

‘ First, the show will provide a
chance to see the new Foster the-
ater, which will be the Players
new home from now on.

Second, students will find out
if director Carl Cass’s “Fresh
Fields” is as funny as reports say.
Written by Ivor Novello, “Fresh
Fields” was produced on Broad-
way last year and received favor-
able notices.

NINE IN CAST

The cast of the first Players
show of the year numbers nine,
five of who have been in the dra-
matic group’s shows before. Of
the five, three hold leads in “Fresh
Fields.” Last spring Bill Hoeveler,
C39, -was teamed" with Ione Wil-
liams, Ed38,..,in “Goodbye, Again.”

tute of Technology. From Frick
come Phyllis Post, Ed39; Roberta

HUMOR IN LINES

As a comedy, “Fresh Fields” de-
pends on humorous lines rather
than slapstick. Its situation invol-
es a titled English family whom
’29 caught short. Making up for
their large household’s expenses is
an Australian family; but, of
course the money they pay is not

subjects, according to John Mar-
tinco, C39, co-chairman. The
series has not been planned as a
debate between Republican and
Democrats, he says.

That long-awaited and once-
cancelled debate between the two
Pittsburgh mayoralty candidates is
really going to take place.
Robert N. Waddell, Republican
candidate for mayor, and Mayor
Cornelius D. Scully, Democratic
nominee, will debate at Pittsburgh
Community Forum on the eve of
election day——-unless political de-
velopments once again cause plans
to go awry. The Forum meeting

November 1, at 8:15 o’clock in the
Schenley high school auditorium.

Postponed from Monday, today’s
meeting will follow the regular
procedure of Inquiry Forum. Ma-
yor Scully will speak for the first
half—hour. He will answer student
questions in a forum period until
the end of the session, 1:30 o’clock.

Hears Address
By NYA Head

Continuing the series of voca-
tional conferences sponsored by
the information committee of
WSGA, S. W. McGowan will speak
today at 3:30 o’clock in 108 Ca-
thedral.

Mr. McGowan, who is the West-
ern Pennsylvania head of the
Works Progress Administration

tration, will have as his subject,
“What Is the Place of NYA in
Colleges and Universities?”

othy Dering, C39, and working in
cooperation with Miss Frances
McLaughlin, assistant dean of _wo.-
men in charge of employment, the
committee has. three main. pur-
poses: to make women on campus
vocation-conscious; to aid those
who cannot decide on a vocation;
and to assist those who have al-
ready chosen a vocation by show-
ing them the opportunities or dis-
advantages of the field they have
chosen.

Women who have already been
assigned to NYA positions, those
who have applied for work, and
students interested in government
service are especially asked to at-
tend today’s conference. The meet-
ing is open, however, to anyone
else who wishes to hear Mr. Mc-

At Meeting Today

Pitt Peace Council will make
plans for the year’s program at
its ﬁrst meeting of the semester
today at 12:30 o’clock in 329
Cathedral.

Business before the meeting,
according to John Fritzmeier,
C39,.chairman of the group, in-
cludes presentation of a concrete
program of action for the year,
election of members of the execu-
tive committee, and a discussion of
problems confronting the Peace
Council.

First action to be undertaken
by the Council, says Fritzmeier,
will be an Armistice Day peace
program. He also hopes to widen
the scope of membership in the
Council to include representatives
from all campus organizations.

Today’s meeting is the ﬁrst of

— :a series of Peace Council sessions

to be held during the year. Be-
cause the work of organization
and program planning will be in-
itiated today, the meeting is im-
portavnt, Fritzmeier said.

‘ tudents who wish to associ-
ate themselves with an organiza-
tion vitally interested in peace ed-
ucation and action should be pres-
ent,” he declared.

In a meeting last week, the
Peace Council committee was ad-
dressed by Don Royer, student di-

_ rector for the Emergency Peace

campaign. Royer emphasized the
need for an active peace group on
campus.

Practice  
Gridders Play
Shady Side
In Gameﬁrill

Harv-ey Booker, head man of the
intramural program, sent his
green junior varsity gridders
against the Shady Side Academy
aggregation Monday for their first
taste of organized ‘ team‘ action.
The Pitt Jayvee—Shady Side con-
test brought together two Suther-
land products and exponents of
the Panther system, Rooker, and
Bobby LaRu-e, now coaching at

I ~ the Academy. ‘

Rooker was pleased with the
showing of his club. They have
not had very much training, and
"Booker inserted every‘ member of
the squad into the game in order
to get a better line on his material.
He won’t announce a regular
eleven until the boys play another
game.

Coach Rooker says; “We have
better material than the small
colleges. With two months of
training we could lick Westmin-
-ster and Geneva. Hagan’s new ath-
letic policy should encourage more
‘students to try out for the junior
varsity.”

Outstanding in Monday’s tilt
were, Bennett, John McNeil, a
young fullback with plenty of
drive; Howdy Brien, former cen-
ter for Schenley Hi, who was eas-
ily the star of the game. Brien, if
he were heavier, would be varsity
material. His snap backs are per-
fect, and he really nails a man
when he tackles him. Howdy rip-

ped thru three times to nail Shady’

Side backs for substantial losses,
and block two kicks. Captain Pow-
ers, at quarterback, is the LaRue
type of, player. ‘He’s,peppy, alert,
fast, and tough.

‘At -.present *the junior varsity

When an apparently strong,run-

in the offing.

All of which leads up to the
fact that there will be quite a
"football game at the Stad'um on
Saturday. Just the other day Bill
Kern issued his opening pre-Pitt
game blast.

Kern took the Tartan starting
line-up and gave it a thorough
jumbling. Chief change was that
which sent Captain Charley Mis-
kevics to the bench and brought
up sophomore Schmidt to a start-.
ing position.

Varsity Qliance
~ And F1111
Await Entrants

Young and inexperienced play-
-ers will dribble all over the Sta-
dium basketball court beginning
next Monday; because at 3:30
o’clock on that day, the novice
basketeers’ tournament will begin

under the guidance of Dr. H. C.
Carlson, varsity basketball coach.
The dribbling is open to all un-
tutored players who want some
good fun, and a chance to show
the coaches what they: might pos-
sibly do on a varsity team. It-costs
nothing and hasn’t many require-
ments. All you haveto do is to
fill out one of the coupons -printed
on this page and take it over to
the student health service in Falk
Clinic on Fifth Avenue. Then on
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday or
Friday round up your own set of
gym equipment and go up to the
stadium. ‘
EVERYBODY PLAYS

First come, ﬁrst served, is the
rule Dr. Carlson has laid down, so
the minute ten men are on the
floor, a game begins. These ten
men will play an eight minute
quarter while the next ten men.
assemble. While the first team
rests, the second team plays, and
vice versa. In this way there will
be plenty of time for everyone to
play.

There will be no “subs” or ex-
tras. If you come to the floor in
your gym suit, you play. Every-'
one will play. That’s the sponsor's
guarantee.

The varsity team will send sev-
eral of its members over to referee
the’. games andto help Dr..Car1-
son as observers. Many of these

ament and since 1929, no fewer
than three ’ steam c_aptains were
discovered by Coach Carlson when
they played in the tournament.
Willie Artura, Wunderlich, and
Ted Roderick, were team captains
who got their starts as novices.
So, there really have been oppor-
tunities that have been had in the
tournament. Of course there have
been manytothers, not captains,
who have played varsity ball
that have had little experience be-
fore coming to Pitt, and have got-

ten their starts in this way.

Wasserrnann Tests . . .

ITH this issue is recorded the progress,

made in the program of free Wassermann _
tests begun Monday through the cooperation
of the University’s student health services, the ’
City’s department of health and The Pitt,
News.

More than the expected number of students
turned out for their tests the first day; others I
made appointments for later this week. Indi-
cations point to a large number of students
taking it in the near future.

That some people will mis-interpret the pur-
pose of the test is expected, but The News
hopes that this number will be small, especially
after the statements of commendation issued
by Dr. Auleene Jamison, women’s health di-
rector; Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, director of
men’s student health service; Dr. Vincent
VV. Lanfear, dean of men, and Dr. I. H. Alex-
ander, City health director.

In subsequent issues, the question of the
anti—syphilis program, especially its place on
campus, will be developed by experts in the
ﬁeld.

In the meantime, the student health services
are open daily. ,

Take the VVasserma.nn test or make an ap-
pointinent for taking one.

Boost For Dr. Hovde . 

NE of the men on the faculty of the Univer-
sity, a.t present on leave of absence, has
been receiving high praise in his position in
the Mayor Scully cabinet. .
The man, Dr. B. J. Hovde, associate profes-
sor of history, and at present director of the
City’s department of welfare, has always

 

His teaching, according to students who have
taken his courses, has been above par, his re-
lations with students, from the student stand-
point, perfect. ‘

And so, it is not surprising to read in a col-
umn of last Sunday’s Pittsburgh Press, that
Dr. Hovde “has, all things considered, made a
better impression on more people at City Hall
than any department head named since Mr.
Scully became Mayor.”

University associates can vouch for the state-
ment that “Mr. Hovde professes to be no poli-
tician. He has had no political career. As a
Pitt professor he frequently criticized the poli-
ticians, sometimes at apparent risk to his em-
ployment. ’ ’

That Dr. Hovde carried into his City work
the same conscientiousness that marked his
academic career, may be seen in the following
extract from a hard-boiled political writer:
“But there can be no doubt . Director
Hovde has worked at his task and has probed
the whys and wherefores of his department . . .

“The people who like Dr. Hovde,” the col-
umnist continues, “point to his forthright man-
ner, his disinclination to waste words (an at‘-
tribute, suﬁcient to make nearly anyone popu-
lar at City Hall), his direct and industrious
application to his job, which he didn’t take be-
carse he needed the money and which he ap-
pears to enjoy.”

“Certainly,” concludes Mr. Kermit McFar-
land, writer of the article, “he has shown as
VVelfare Director that there are men who can
get along with the politicians and still not
stoop to some of the petty practices of the
trade.”

At’ present we are looking forward to seeing
Dr. Hovde back teaching his undergraduate
classes next semester-——since he did so well last
semester in both positions.

True Love? ? ?

The Rover boys led by Bob Schooley, believing that
their heart—throbs were keeping the home ﬁres
burning, due to the fact that they felt inclined to
do the high spots strictly stag, were quite taken

back upon ﬁnding their fair damsels in someone
else’s arms at the last spot they visited . . . No
more stagging it for the Rover boys . . . Last

Sat. evening paper led us to believe that Don
Bestor was to play for the Soph Hop which was
to be held at Webster Hall . . . Monday’s news
states that Phil Levant’s orchestra will furnish
the music . . . A reliable source leads us to be-
lieve that Webster Hall will be unavailable and
the Grotto may have to be resorted to . . . Well
at least there is going to be a Soph Hop . . . we
hope .

initials only is requested.

Editor, The Pitt News:

The other day I was told of an incident that
seemed utterly incredible. A male member of the
teaching staff smoked in the Commons Room. But
that was not the worst of the offense. Having ﬁn-
ished smoking the cigarette, he turned to the near-
est pillar and crushed out the ﬁre in the cigarette
butt on it. An old friend of mine told me and I
believe the story.

The man who thus disﬁgured the superb Com-
mons Room by his conduct should not only not have
done so, but should, as a member of the teaching
staff, have lent a hand in enforcing rules against
improper conduct in thee Cathedral. I am old-fash-
ioned enough to believe that part of my duty as a
member of the teaching staff lies in helping en-
force the rules and regulations of the institution
with which I am connected.

The very great majority of our students cooper-
ate most excellently well in upholding the dignity
of the place. But there are still those, particularly
among the budding embryonic barristers and stu-
dents of the Evening Division, who ﬂount our rules
about smoking in the Cathedral. A little discipline
applied to these offenders should put them in their
place.

What would you think of a fellow who comes into
an office scattering the stenchy stuff from the bowl
of his pipe on the ofﬁce floor A man came into my
office the other day doing just that thing. The man
did not know what he was doing, and I did not tell
him about it. The stench should have sufﬁced.
“What fools we mortals be!”

Words Of  Wise

Modern Barbarism
Dr. Bernard C. Clausen, pastor of the First Baptist
church, in Sunday night sermon:
“Newest fashions for women are "barbaric in
their luxurious display and repudiate all the sim-
plicity and efficiency which produces ordered life.

Worst of all, they are deliberately seductive.”

S I  .-  Upon 192‘9,TF1‘e‘e;:m,gs -
' A A  ” By Josnrn MccLosKr.v

During the last two weeks, the nation has been treated to a
repeat performance of November, 1929. The stock market con-
tinuing its dizzy descent, has wiped out thousands of small in-
vestors who thought that a 55 percent‘ margin requirement made
“dabbling in the market” as safe as going to church on Sunday.

More and more, the fact becomes evident that the little boys

get ﬂeeced. And I suppose that¢

we cafi"t° be, too harsh-in our con-
demnation of the big boys in the
market, for after all, most of us
get a savage thrill out of taking
one or more of our fellow men for
a ride.

But as to causes of the latest
plunge: was it the natural reac-
tion of an inﬂated market? Most
people thought that a high margin"
requirement would prevent an in-
ﬂation. And when stock prices
were doubling themselves, follow-
ers of the market were proclaim-
ing it the herald of returning
prosperity, the surest indication
that frozen ‘capital had thawed
out. Possibly, however, a few
shoestring, players crept in the
back door to upset the dope.

DELIBERATE MANEUVERS

Was it the result of war scares,
the capture of"loyalist strongholds
by the rebels in Spain; the re-
pulse of Japanese at Shanghai;
the Hitler-Mussolini conference?
Hardly. Such scares and threats
have ﬁlled the air ever since Hit-
ler came to power in Germany
and Japan carved Manchukuo out
of China in 1932.

Was it the reaction to the an-
nouncement of the Second New
Deal by President Roosevelt? Is
private capital deliberately man-
euvering to discredit the adminis-
tration by bringing on the ap-
pearance of a repetition of the late
unlamented depression? A selling
wave is relatively easy to start so
that such maneuvering is not be-
yond possibility. And if this is
true, it constitutes one of the

strongest indictments which can
be hurled against ﬁnance capital-
ism: if a few manipulators sitting
in their offices in Wall street can
scare enough capital out of circu-
lation to induce another depres-
sion despite the existence of every
other indication to the contrary,
then government intervention is
absolutely necessary.

FASCIST DELIGHT

Perhaps, however, the interests
hope to induce another depression,
(or the appearances thereof), for-
get about blaming it on the admin-
istration, and direct all the re-
sponsibility to the shoulders of
the labor unions of the nation.
Herein lies the greatest possibil-
ity of danger in the present situa-
tion. If the interests can rig up a
plausible case against labor
unions, particularly that bloc of
unions under the aegis of John
Lewis and the Committee for In-
dustrial’ Organization, the dear‘
pee-pul may be so misled as to
demand the liquidation of the la-
bor unions. And the liquidation
of labor unions is one of the prin-
cipal delights of a Fascist govern-
ment.

ABBING a bit of moisture from his eyes at his unknown team of

ﬁve years ago “that didn’t look strong enough to kick its way out

of a paper bag,” Coach Jimmy Conzelman, of Washington University in
St. Louis, tells you how his team now comes to play such notables as
Southern Methodist and Army. How he did it, with the aid of a percus-
sive banjo, wow speechmaking, de luxe character building and what not,
is probably the most hilarious football gossip you ever read. You’1l weal:
out your copy of the Post this week showing it to friends.
