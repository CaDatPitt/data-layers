Gays, lesbians

Coming Out Day

By Jenna Ferrara
T be Pitt News '

Defrocked Methodist minister James Hawk
condemned the Chrisitian Church as
overwhelmingly homophobic at a National
Coming Out Day event Friday.

“The message the church gives is not the
Good News. It’s not the message that God
gives to God’s people: It’s not who you love,
but how you love them,” he said.

Hawk, who was expelled from the ministry
for being gay, spoke Friday as part of the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance’s
celebration of National Coming Out Day.

BiGALA also sponsored a table in the student
union, where students could pick up
information about understanding
homosexuality as well as buy brightly colored
stickers which read, “I Love Militant
Homosexuals.” ‘ '

Hawk was raised in a close-knit Methodist
community. He said he learned “the most
important thing Christians are supposed to be
doing is loving other people.”

Hawk said in college he “fought not to be
a homosexual.” He dated a woman, but it
didn’t work out, “laughing uncontrollably for
15 minutes” when she tried to kiss him.

“They- speak of [homosexuality as an]
unnatural sex act. It seemed unnatural for me
to be doing that with her, and we broke it off,”
Hawk said.

After being ordained, Hawk felt compelled

to tell his bishop that he was a “self-avowed, -

practicing homosexual. If I was going to take
a church, I could not deny who I was.”

The board of ministers overwhelmingly
voted “not to join hands in proclaiming the
Good News to lesbians and gays” and
prohibited Hawk from being a minister, he
said.

“It was the first time I was ever ashamed of
my church,” Hawk said.

Hawk now works in Nashville, Tenn., for
the National Association for Rabbis, Priests
and Ministers.

There are homosexual themes in Christianity,
including the love between Naomi and’ Ruth
in the Book of Ruth, Hawk said.

“I am not above saying Jesus was gay. He
was fully human  and for Jesus to be fully
human he had to have attractions to men.

T en students attacked in North Ooz/elomd

By Renee Crespy
Asst. News Editor

A group of 10 students was attacked early
Sunday morning by seven unidentified males.

The group was on S. Neville Street heading
towards Fifth Avenue when the suspects,
who were sitting on a porch,'started yelling
Obscenities and following them. -

“They started yelling things like, ‘Wh
don’t you come party with us?’ and, ‘Find
some real men,”’ said one of the victims.
“They also said, ‘You think we’re not a bunch
of bad gangbangers. Well, watch out.’ We
thought they were kidding. They were a
bunch of little punks who couldn’t have been
more than 17,” said the victim.

suspects began throwing rocks at them..- At
that point one of the suspects pulled a knife
on the group and began "waving it at them,
while others began punching and kicking
several of the victims. '

/ One of the victims was taken by ambulance
to Shadyside Hospital, where his condition is
listed as good. .

After approximately 10 minutes, a friend of
the victims drove up, and they yelled for him
to call the police.

“As soon as they heard the word ‘police,’
they took off,” said one of the victims. By the
time the police arrived‘, the suspects had ﬂed
on foot. ‘

The police report, which was filed by
officer Doug McMeekin, stated the suspects
werereported to have been at a party before

the incident at either 201 or 203 S. Neville
Street.
. According to one of the victims, the police
did not go back to those addresses.
“To my knowledge they didn’t go back to
the house. The officer I spoke to was kind of

clueless,” said the victim. “He said he would‘

have to speak to the other officers.” None of
the officers were available for comment._

According to one of the victims, this crime
is a perfect example to warn students “to be
cautious.”

“They say, ‘Don’t go out alone,’ but I
thought we’d be safe in a big group. I just
want everyone to know that they are not
really safe. even if they think they are,” said

one victim. “Just becauseit’s Pittsburgh and"

  Campu split 

on Thomas
allegations

By Kim Palmiero '
sum‘ Writer '

Controversy. surrounding
Supreme Court nominee Judge
Clarence Thomas has divided Pitt
students and has caused some to
question the integrity ,of the
senators themselves.

Oklahoma law professor Anita”
Hill’s accusations of sexual V
harassment by Judge Thomas I
created a bitterdispute on the
ﬂoor of the Senate. Thomas’
confirmation vote, which was
originally scheduled for last
Tuesday, was postponed for one
week so that the Senate Judiciary

from both Hill and Thomas. The
controversy has created what
many say is “a fatal split between
Republicans and Democrats.”

The allegations have also split
campus political organizations- -

Senior Bri-a-n...~De-iderick, . a
’ member of the College .
Republicans, said Thomas is being
done “an incredible and huge
wrong.

“I don’t really know if I think
he is being treated fairly. [Senate
members] knew about the
accusations. All of a sudden the
Democrats realized that he would
get the vote, and "so they tried to
ruin him,” Deiderick said.

Despite the allegations, the
issue is Thomas’ judicial
performance, according to
Deiderick.

“T 0 bring something like this
out on almost the eve of the vote
makes me think that some people
were against him. The question
becomes, ‘How will it affect his
ability to judge cases?’ It’s a tough
question to ask,” Deiderick said.

Deiderick would like to see
Thomas elected because “he has
a track record of looking at both
sides, and it seems like he follows
his conscience.” "

College Republicans President 0
Jacinta Dvorak could not be,
reached for comment.

Joel Leonard, president of the
College Democrats, doesn’t see
the accusations as an attempt by 0
Democrats to ruin Thomas’
reputation.

“I do think that we are taking
the _right course of scrutiny
because this man is going to sit
on the highest court in the nation,”
Leonard said.

Leonard said he believes Hill is
telling the truth.

“I don’t think it’s likely that she
wouldn’t be telling the truth. She’s
agreed to take the polygraph test.

‘Alumni club aims to improvelife for black students

- By Franco Bonacchl
For T be P!!! News

-What started as a
communications class project led
to the formation of the African-
Amercian Pitt Alumni Club.

l)uring her last semester as an
undergraduate .\'ona R. Martin
designed the club as part of an
assignment for her Written
Professional Communications
class. Martin got the idea after
reading the Black Action Society's
letter that discouraged African-
American students from attending
Pitt until the- academic, social
and cultural environment for
black students on campus
improved.

Martin took her project to
Assoctiate Provost Jack Daniel,

‘and together they brought the
idea before the Pitt Alumni
Association's Board of Directors,
which ratified it in August.

a" The AAP./\(I was proposed l)y

Marlin partly in response to the
BAS concerns and partly because
she felt there was a need for such
an organi/.ation on-campus.

“I thought the main reason for
such an organiration was to
actually improve conditions for

S KABOOM...
(SEE MIDDLE!)

  STUDENTS.’

You are cordially invited to an

OPEN HOUSE

black students here at Pitt. In
response to some of the demands
that BAS was asking earlier in the
year, I felt there should have

been some sort of mechanism to

help lI5ASl and help the African-
American students here on
campus," Martin said.

In order to improve conditions
for black students at Pitt, the
AAPAC hopes to establish
educational programs as well as
scholarships. AAPAC plans to help
the black students that are already
here as well as encourage
other black students to "enroll at
Pitt.

“()ne program we would like

.to see started is a mentoring

program where African-American
alumni would interact and form a
partnership with African-
Arnerican students and help them
graduate. One of the problems
with African-American students
here at Pitt is that three out of l()
students graduate, and I think
that is a poor performance rating,”
Martin said.

According to Martin,
the reason for that low number is
that students have a hard time

making the adjustment to the.

campus environment. She hopes
the AAPAC can assist in making
that adjustment much easier. “'lhe
reason why students are not able
to stay here and why we are not
able to obtainstudents is more

and

said.

“The alumni association hopes
to find out from the students
what exactly [they] need in order
to stay here at Pitt. If you don’t
know what is going on on the the
campus you can’t do anything for
the students,” Martin said.

The club would also like to be
active in the recruitment process
ofminority students, Martin said.

' “\\"e would like to work with
the admissions office and talk to
parents of potential Pitt students
to ensure them that their lchildl
will have an alumni community
with resources they can draw
upon," Martin said.

When parents realize what
resources are at Pitt, it makes it
easier for them to decide if their
child should attend Pitt, according
to Martin.

Martin said the club is in the
process of developing the new
programs through its ?>2—member
steering committee, which serves

as a governing body and will‘

hold its officer elections in the
spnng.

Marta liffinger, chairperson of
the Black Action Society and
member of the club’s steering
committee, feels that the club is a
way for African-American alumni
to give back and assist black
students who have not yet

-graduated. “Because they have

graduated already, they can give
some type of support and insight
into what we need to do and how
they made their lives better while
they were here,” Effmger said.
The African-American Pitt
Alumni Club has sent out
approximately 2,400 applications
to individuals who might be
interested in joining the group.
The club membership is open
to anyone that the alumni
association is open to and the
only requirement is that all

members must work toward the _

goals of the organization.
Martin said the initial reaction
to the formation of the club was
tremendous acceptance. “Every
person that I've approached about
this program in the university has
been overwhelmingly receptive,
and I think it just confirms that
everyone wanted to do it. I think
even on the part of the Alumni
Association, they felt it was
something that was needed,” said
Maitin, .
: Martin said the overall goal of

the organization is to bring more 7

African—Americans into the alumni
association, which does not have
a large percentage of minority
members.

“It has been a dilemma for the
alumni association because they
want to get minorities involved,
but they're not sure how to do it,”
Martin said.

Flash ﬂood gave O’Neill ‘big break’

By Skip Leezer
Staff Writer

You might not think being washed through a
storm sewer during a ﬂash ﬂood could ever be
a positive experience, but for Brian O’Neill, it
was his “biggest break in writing." ‘

A native ofCarle Place, i\'.Y., O’Neill graduated
from Syracuse University in 1978 with a dual
major in newspaper journalism and English.

“I didn’t write for the school paper,” he said,
admitting that as a “cardinal mistake. I just didn’t
have the time.”

Without experience, O’Neill set out to find a
job. After several months and many turned-
down resumes, 7beDanville Register in Virginia
finally offered him a job covering city hall.

After covering city hall for over a year, O’Neill
took the advice ofa friend and applied for a job
at the Roanoke Times and World News in
January 1980. He spent eight years in Virginia,
five as a columnist, before coming to Pittsburgh.

While in Roanoke, O’Neill wrote his “big
break,” a personal account of what he saw
while caught in a ﬂash ﬂood. The article
eventually appeared in several larger papers,
including The New York Times.

O’Neill said he learned a lot while in Roanoke
and credits much ofit to the writing seminars he
attended while there. “They put things in a way
that have always stuck with, me. It’s not enough
to just get the facts in there and spell every word
correctly,” O’Neill said. _ ’ 0

‘‘You’ve got to tell the story in a way that won’t
let them leave, that demands that they read the
next paragraph. If you give [the readers] an
opportunity to drop you once they’ve picked
you up, they’re going to do it.” ”

An editor at the Roanoke T imestold O’Neill of
an opening at The Pittsburgh Press.

After a couple of months, O’Neill decided to
call and see if the job was still open. It was, and
he applied.

Months went by, and he heard no response.

Assuming the job had either been filled or left
vacant, O’.\'eill forgot about it. But then the call
came, and the rest is history. ‘

O’.\'eill has worked as a columnist at The
Pittsburgh Press since December of 1988 and
writes four columns a week.

He has received several awards since coming
to Pittsburgh, including best columnist, awarded
to him by Pittsburgh Magazine in 1989.

O’Neill explained that he would rather write
three columns a week, but “if you're in a paper
fourtimes a week, it's easierto build a readership."

By appealing to a large variety ofthe population
with his blunt style, O’.\'eill’s readership has
grown steadily since arriving here in Pittsburgh.

His columns, which appear on thefront page
of the local section, are often humorous pieces
on controversial issues. For example, O’.\'eill
recently wrote about Pitt spending S3/t(),0()0 to
remodel President J. Dennis O'Connor’s home,
which the county appraised at $400,000.

O’Neill said he has a hard time justifying the
expense because the amount Pitt is spending on
repairs is three to four times the value of an
average house.

“You couldn’t put S3/t0,000 into my house,
even if you tried,” O’.\'eill joked, saying that the
money would still eventually come out of students’

' pockets.

O’Neill’s average day is anything but average.
One day he’s on the phone.calling for information;
the next,he’s on a committee to improve the
work place or speakinggto a 10th-grade linglish
class.

“More and more I’m using the phone [to get
information for articles], which I don’t think is
good,” O’Neill said.~“Columns are almost always
better if you get out and meet people.”

' O’Neill seems to have an opinion on everything,
including politics and drugs.

The Republicans in the '80s wanted to get the
government “off the people’s backs,” according

\ to O’Neill.

C GS agrees to /yelp

coalition

acquire

cbila’ care subsidy

By Sandy Lasswell
For Tbe Pill News

Inadequate university policies
for child care will be examined in
a joint effort by two Pitt
organizations. .

The College ofGcneral Studies
Student Government Council
agreed at its meeting last week to
assist the Pitt Coalition for Child
Care, which is seeking university-
sponsored child care that is
affordable and available to
students who have variable
schedules.

According to Christine Ross, a
coalition representative, a task
force on child care had previously
recommended that child care
should be available to students
and should be subsidized by
Pitt. * . —

Instead the university provided
space for an outside contractor to
provide care, whichis used
primarily by faculty and staff
members, neglecting the needs
of student-parents.

To dramatize the need for child
care on the linivcrsity of
Pittsburgh campus, the
coalition is sponsoring an
informational event on the

William Pitt ljnion lawn on Oct.

30. ,

Students can learn about the
childcare situation at Pitt, and
children can visit face painting
booths.

‘the

in other COS business, council
President Marcie Roberts reported
that she has made the university's
administration aware of
C08‘ displeasure with the

plans for an undergraduate‘
Business _

College of
Administration.

Under the proposal, the C08
business degree would be
eliminated and would result in a
1/i—percent decrease in
enrollment. '

The Council agreed to sponsor
a blood drive to be held on .\'ov.

“Of course, then they moved
the government in front of you
and made you piss into a bottle to
prove that you weren’t on drugs, "
O’Neill said, referring to drug
testing.

People often tell O’Neill that

_ his columns are biased, he
said.

“Some people don’tunderstand

what a columnist is supposed to

d/o,” O’Neill said.

“I'm not supposed to have the
last word. I’m supposed to spark
discussion,” he said. A

When O’Neil1firststarted at the
Press, his columns were 15 inches
long.

They soon grew to 18, then 21,
which took away from front-page
space.

O’Neill explained that his editor,
whom he calls “a blunt and honest
man,” called him into his office
and said, “You’re growing faster

than your readership. Cut it.”

‘‘I’m forced now to tell my story
in a certain amount of space,”
said O’Neill, who believes this
helped make his columns
better.

“It’s harder to write a short
story than a long story because
you’re making every word
count”

Stuck to the side of a computer
a few feet from his cubicle rests a
sticker: “Editors are always Write.”

said.

Connett said the only “safe and
sensible” way to build an
incinerator was to not build it.

Connett, who referred to WTI’s
consultants as “scientiﬁc whores”
in a speech delivered at Chatham
College in September, was highly
critical of the evaluation
conducted by the Center for
Hazardous Materials Research, a
member of the University of
Pittsburgh Trust.

“It was obvious that their
science was not physical science
but political science. That report
was a public-relations effort paid
for by WTI,” Connett said.

After the remarks, the protesters
marched to the offices of the
Columbiana County port
authority, located adjacent to the
WTI facility. The port authority,
which had posted a banner
reading, ‘.‘Don’tWaste the Earth-
Support WTl,” leases an already
contaminated riverside plot to
WTI. ~

The protesters, who were
escorted by Greenpeace—trained
“peacekeepers,Z’ chanted, “I won’t
die for WTI,” on their way to the
facility.

Terri Swearingen, a member of
the.‘ Tri-State Environmental
Council, said she was appalled
by the site of the facility.

“It’s located over an aquifer.
It’s on the banks of the Ohio
River. The nearest resident is less
than 300 yards away,” Swearin gen
said. “This is a testing ground.
lWTI] picked the worst place
they could possibly find. They
wanted to see what they could
get away with.”

“Political and regulatory
agencies have been very
unresponsive. Oh well, what can
we expect? [Ohio governor
George] Voinovich’s brother
builds incinerators,” Swearingen
said.

Swearingen was also critical of

destruction and removal-
efficiency tests, which are focal
in determining a facility’s
regulatory compliance.

“lDestruction and removal]
efficiency is not measured during
the actualburning. It’s measured
only one time under very
controlled circumstances and with
certain chemicals,” Swearingen
said.

Local activist Vincent Eirene,
who invited Sheen to the protest,
emphasized the importance of
Ghandian non-violence in civil
disobedience.

“Those who spoke of anger
and revolution in the ’60s are
now selling antiques in
Manhattan. We don’t need them,”
Eirene said.

Connett was critical of the
government’s environmental
agencies.

“People turn to organizations

like the EPA, who are supposed
to be looking out for their health
and for their environment,”
Connett said. “These agencies go
into action all right. But instead
of protecting the people, they
protect the companies.”
Colorful armbands designated
the members of a “core group,”
consisting of Sheen, Swearingen,
Connett, Newman and other
protest leaders. 'When the

speeches ended, the core group ~

said an “Our Father” prayer and
made its way to the fence at the
main entrance to the facility.

“These people are putting their
bodies where their consciences
are,” Sheen said.

Minutes later, Sheen climbed a
fence, followed by the rest of the
core group. Once inside the
facility, Sheen knelt in the dust
and began to pray. Sheen and the
others were then arrested and
taken to Columbiana County jail.

Hard times in East Liverpool
caused opinions to be divided.

“If_ someone offered you $10
an hour, wouldn't you take it?”
asked Zane Jackson, whose wife
works at the facility.

“When that shit comes up out
of the valley for your kids to
inhale, will $10 an hour cover it?”

  Safety a priority at Pitt

A university's responsibility to a student's safety does
not end once the student steps out of “on-campus”
territory.

Crime Stop, a program implemented by the ljniversity
of Pittsburgh Student Government Board, has been
honored for its participation in campus safety. The
program is a communication network through which the
department of public safety can relay_crime information
to and ' from on—campus students via residence hall
captains and resident directors. _ .

’l‘he assistance Crime Stop has given students living in
Pitt residence halls since its start has helped to deter crime
by forcing students to be more cautious of the dangers
surrounding them.

But what about off-campus students? They hear about -
.crime on their streets from the media or from second- and

third—hand informants. It is about time the University of
Pittsburgh administration and student government aid
those who were not fortunate enough to select a winning
number in the housing lottery and those who willingly
chose to live off-campus.

Crime Stop tried in March to assist South Oakland
residents by beginning a program similar to that of the
ones in the residence halls. In conjunction with the South
Oakland Citizens Council, Crime Stop attempted to
organize block captains, who would be in charge of
informing the residents on their streets of recent crimes in
the area. Conﬂicts then arose between permanent residents
and student residents, forcing actions to be “placed on the
back burner." ~

' . Meanwhile, on the “front burner," the organization for

the distribution of rape whistles and defense classes are
considered a priority, and still students living off-campus
are relatively clueless to the danger around them.

I Rape whistles and safety-defense classes can be sought
by students who want them outside university jurisdiction.

’ Although they are preventative measures, knowledge will ’

do students more good than whistles. Students can't be
the only ones'in charge of their own safety.

It is obvious that the SGB, the Pitt administration and the
department of public safety acknowledge their
responsibility ‘to off-campus students. Ilowever these
organizations must realize that because the solution isn’t
readily available that it shouldn't be placed on the “back
bttrner.”

Because the SGB changes each year, the attention of its
membership can fluctuate, and Pitt's administration thinks
it can hide behind this excuse. It can't. ‘

The recent reports of groups of students being attacked.

by other groups of people only prove that there is no
longer safety in numbers.

Patrols are necessary and should be increased. The
lighting in South Oakland must be improved because
dark streets have been known to be major crime areas
worldwide. Although South and .\'orth Oakland are not in
the jurisdiction of the campus police, the appearance of
police cars on patrol through the Oaklands would
intimidate criminals, subsequently reducing crime.

South Oakland, .\'orth Oakland and other municipalities
surrounding the Pitt campus contain large percentages of
students living in low-security buildings. In order to gain
an education, the safety of these students should not be
placed in jeopardy.

The right to choose how we live our lives is a very
precious possession that can be taken away from us
all too easily. The best way to preserve our freedom
is to have as little government involvement in our
lives as possible.

According to the Federal Information Line, the
federal government has not spent any money on
abortions since the Roe vs. Wade court decision in
1973. This makes a lot of sense. Roe vs. Wade was
a victory for pro-choice advocates, and so was the
stoppage of using federal funds for abortion.

Men, it is about time we start getting
our act together. (Women, please
continue reading, as you might gain
insight into the male character.)

We have let ourselves deteriorate so
completely that among females, with
the exclamation, “Menl” all is
understood. We have become very
predictable and frankly quite boring.
We are too eager to fight and too slow
to admit we are wrong. We are men.

To be born male is to be born into the
ultimate club. Until now this has=been
a man’s world. We have held a virtual
monopoly over the powerful positions
in the United States and the world.
When women strive to be equal, they
strive to be equal to us. Televised sports
are there for us to watch. So why do we

V continually fight among ourselves? We
are brothers in the ultimate fraternity.
We are men.

As I walked through Oakland the
other night, I stopped to watch two
men who were standing next to their
cars in the middle of the street. One of
them had decided to stop square in the
‘middle ‘of Bouquet, blocking the one-
way traffic. The man behind him had
no desire to stay there, so he began to
honk, and then they did the male thing:
They each got out of their car to argue
about it. They left their female
companions in the car to step out and
display their masculinity. They also
displayed their cursing skills. No
punches, no shoves, just words. They
finally stopped yelling and continued
in the flowfof traffic. The guy who
parked did nothing but embarrass his
girlfriend, and the guy behind him has
a pretty good story to tell the guys on
.Monday. Of course, they will be
impressed. They are men.

this legacy we have borne a world

for grades, money, women and other
things we deem important until we
have them. Then we want the upgrade.

If we want more sex, we get a mistress.
We can ‘never have too much.

good at becoming the men other men
want us to be. We are men. .
As men in America, we have special

News

The country has been astounded by this
weekend's graphic testimony at the
Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings,
where sexual terms never heard before in
the Senate have dominated the discussions.

It has emerged as more than one
woman’s allegations against one man, and
has escalated into a bitter fight between

» Democrats and Republicans, conservatives

and liberals, women and men.
This last conflict has shadowed the
proceedings.

“It was lurking under Sen. Arlen. Specter’s ’

belief that this harassment really hadn't
happened because Hill moved with
Thomas to work at the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.

It was there when Orrin Hatch said Hill
had invented some of her allegations with
help from other law cases and the novel
Tbe Exorcist. '

Anita Hill’s assertions are being evaluated
by a panel of men who do not and cannot
understand the dynamics of sexual
harassment.

Fourteen men who haven’t experienced
the repeated, unwanted sexual comments
of bossesor co-workers are attempting to
piece together Hill’s credibility by judging
what they would have done in her place.
This is unfair to Anita Hill and to Clarence
Thomas.

They have attacked her credibility
because she did not reveal these charges
until the FBI asked for the information.

Do they understand that many women,

‘some as distinguished as Hill, some not,

are afraid of the intense questioning and

Jenna  
Ferrara

disbelief they will face if theycome forward?

Do they know that in a case where it is
a man’s word against a woman’s, a boss’
word against the employee’s, a woman
charging sexual harassment is at a distinct
disadvantage? ,

Thomas’ supporters view her’ complaints
as a plot against Thomas, not as valid
objections to his credibility. Not to take
her word seriously is insulting to Hill and
to allwomen. '

Anita Hill has been described as “cut
from the same cloth” as Thomas, a
conservative who reluctantly came forward
with her charges after the FBI report was
leaked to the press.

The evidence is shaky that her charges

I are part of an intricate plot to keep Thomas

from the court.

At first the all—male members of the
Senate Judiciary Committee had satisfied
their questions about Thomas’ guilt of
sexual harassment by looking Thomas in
the eye and asking him, “Did you do this
thing?” Specter, among others, "satisfied
his curiosity in this way.

It’s an injustice that the same respect
wasn’t shown to Anita Hill. The “old boys"
network was in full force.

Seven women members of Congress
stormed thejudiciary Committee last week,
demanding that Hill’s allegations be

 

Iraq in danger of Hussein again

Joe
Babinsack

"So we have another fiasco involving
Iraq? Amazing, isn’t it, how a country can
rebound from a defeat as humiliating as
the one handed to Hussein by the United
States? The way we’ve been celebrating
over here, you would have thought that
the belligerent nature of that country was
crushed forever. But that madman Hussein
is still going strong.

The big bully on the block got a little
miffed when someone else played his
game, so big bad George Bush taught him
a lesson he'd never forget. Too bad
George’s target was off-line. The only
lesson learned was by the people of Iraq,
who now know to shut up and listen to
their government.

Right now 170,000 innocent children
are dying because of our massive show of
force against the evil of Saddam Hussein.
But Hussein still lives, and we claim a
victory. How. many times did «Bush say,

“We have nothing against the people of ,

Iraq?” If the struggle was against a man
readily compared to Hitler, why didn’t we
kill him? War is killing. How can it be

, justified to ‘avoid destroying the brains

behind a world problem and instead
murder a million people not involved in
the decisions?

It would have been a lot easier (and a“ lot

_ cheaper) to put a bounty on the head of

Saddam Hussein. Let’s say $10 billion.
That way the next man in charge would be
ingratiated to the point where he would
gladly back down to dictate to his
newfound country. And ignore another

4 vicious madman, you ask? Certainly. It’s

not like we had any problems with Hussein
for the last decade or have any difficulty
swallowing an alliance with Assad of
Syria. I ‘ ' ~

When he was running for election, Bush
was often charged with being a wimp. The

  Sexual harassment not laughing matter

investigated.

They did this not to say that her charges
were true; instead they wanted the all-
male committee to give the same respect
to her word.

And the vote wasn’t delayed because of
some sudden respect for women’s rights.
Thomas’ supporters were afraid they
couldn’t get the votes necessary for
conﬁrmation without a delay.

Sen. John Danforth’s comment last week
that the vote was delayed “with regret for
the deep injustice done Clarence Thomas”
is unfounded. _

There is nothing wrong with delaying
the vote in an attempt to discover the
truth. '

Admittedly, the truth is hard to find in
this case.

It’s her word against his. We’re never
going to know the truth about what really
happened behind the closed doors of
their offices 10 years ago. It all comes
down to who you believe.

But Congress must be more
representative of the constituency it makes
laws for. There are two women senators,
and 29 of 435 members of the House are
women.

The blatant disrespect shown to Anita
Hill before and after her testimony is just
one more reason why women, who
comprise more than half the U.S.
populatiorr, must be represented more
fairly in their own government. .

Study‘ abroad increase

Over the past few weeks, we have
heard a lot about a proposed $1
tuition increase to fund study—abroad
scholarships. Within days of the
announcement, the Study Abroad ‘
Office had managed to collect
hundreds of signatures in favor of the
proposal. Recently, however, the
Student Government Board has
literally changed the rules in the middle
of the game. To increase voter turn-
out in the upcoming SGB election,
they have opted to turn the study?
abroad proposal into a referendum.

Voter tum—out for past SGB elections
remains around 800 students. This is
not at all a favorable sampling of the
university population. l...l The support
that the SAO have received from SGB
President Saunders has been excellent.

l...l. Although many study-abroad
programs are no more expensive than
going to Pitt, this fund would give
many students who never dreamt of
going abroad the opportunity to
enhance their education. I would urge.
readers to go out and vote “yes” to the
Study Abroad Referendum l...l

Tight end Dave Moore (far left) and the rest of the Pitt bench anguish over their performance in South Bend, Indiana. Pitt lost to Notre Daune for the fourth straight time.

Iris/9 use ground game to band
Panthers tbeirﬁrst defeat, 42- 7

‘ By Rob Maz11r

Sports Editor

SOUTH BEND, Ind. —— Two
years ago Pitt went into South
Bend unbeaten and hoping to
knock off a higher-ranked Notre
Dame. They lost 45-7.

This year the Panthers again
entered South Bend undefeated
again hoping to beat the highly
touted and higher-ranked Irish.
They lost again, this time 42-7.

What happened to Pitt on
Saturday was no ﬂuke. Notre
Dame has proven time and again
that it can play with the best
teams in the nation.

While the Irish entered the
game with a 4-1 record, their lone
loss was to the Wolverines of
Michigan. Notre Dame arguably
plays the toughest schedule in
the country.

The Panthers, on the other
hand, hoped to gain some respect
from the rest of the nation and
prove that their fast start was not
a mirage. Pitt’s schedule so far
has not been nearly as strong as
the Irish’s.

Pitt entered the game coming
off of two hard-fought wins

against two less—than-stellar
teams. They managed to escape
Minneapolis with a one point-
victory. The big play that helped
the Panthers was a blocked punt
for the special teams.

Last week they thwarted a last-
minute Maryland drive to escape
with a four-point win. The key
plays in that game were made by
the defense. One came when
free safety Lex Perkins jarred the
ball away from Terp Richie Harris
on third down. The other came
when Doug Whaley intercepted
Maryland quarterback Jim
Sandwisch’s pass at the one—yard
line. '

The defense and special teams
have held the Panthers together
this year. They got the ball rolling
in games when the offense could
not even score from the opposing
teams’ 20-yard line. ,

However against Notre Dame
the defense could only hold on
so long with the offense
sputtering. The offense was not
only not on track, it got left
standing at the station. The special
teams, a bright spot for the
Panthers all year, seemed to have
stayed home in Pittsburgh.

The offense had all its options
limited against the“Irish. It could
only get what the defense gave
them. N otre Dame’s defense came
out in a nickel package that had
shut down the Stanford Cardinals
a week before, and it shut down
Pittsburgh as well.

“I did not think that theycould
shut down the running game as
well as they did,” said head coach
Paul Hackett. “I thought that we
were prepared for their nickel
defense, but we never were able
to get in our rhythm. I think this
is a fine Notre Dame team and
that they are as strong as anyone
in the nation.” "

Pitt held Notre Dame scoreless
in the first quarter but could not
score themselves. Then the Irish
took the ball and drove it down
the Panthers’ throat. When the
Panthers got the ball back, they
could not do anything with it.
The ensuing punt by back—up
punter Leon Theodorou was
blocked by Notre Dame’s Reggie
Brooks, who went through the
Panther line untouched and
recovered it for a touchdown.

After that the rout was on.

Special teams play

key role in Pitt loss

I By Derek Willis

Asst. Sports Editor

SOUTH BEND, Ind. -— It shouldn’t be very surprising that Pitt
lost to Notre Dame 42-7 Saturday. After all, according to their
head coach, the Panthers only played one—third of the game
well. .

“We played reasonably well defensively,” said Paul Hackett,
.“but offensively, we could not get anything going.”

And then there were the special teams. Normally a strong
point for the Panthers this season, they suffered through two
fumbles and a punt block in South Bend, Ind., putting the team
in big holes against a tough opponent.

“Terribly disappointing,” is how Hackett put it.

Senior kick returner Steve Israel, one of the biggest reasons
for Pitt’s successes this year, dropped two punts. One set up an
Irish score. There were other lapses as well. V

Notre Dame blocked a Leon Theodorou punt, which was
recovered for another touchdown. One of Theodorou’s
successful kicks could have been downed at the Irish one—yard
line, but the ball bounced throughthe hands of special—teams
veteran Vernon Lewis and rolled into the end zone for a
touchback. ‘

“We’ve been winning games with our special teams,” Hackett
said. “Thatis been our forté.”

Indeed, coming into the game, special teams had been an
important factor in the five Pitt victories. Israel was the Big East
Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance against
Minnesota on Sept. 29. In that game he compiled 124 total
return yards. Before Saturday’s game, Israel ranked fifth in the
country in kickoff returns, averaging over 30 yards a try.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 14, 1991

Game

Continued from page 10
Notre Dame continued to run at

will .over the hapless Panthers.
They racked up 327 yards on the
ground on 60 attempts. While
quarterback Rick Mirer had a
miserable day passing (5-15, with
one TD and two interceptions),
he made the big play when he
had to. He had 48 rushing yards
on eight carries, with one rushing
TD in the third quarter.BroOks
opened up the second half with
a 42-yard kickoff return, setting
up Notre Dame’s third score of
the day. Then Mirer added his
score, raising the total to 28-0.
After Panther tight end Eric
Seaman scored a touchdown at
the beginning of the fourth

quarter, the Irish responded with
two more of their Own, providing
for the final margin. The last
Notre Dame touchdown was
scored by third-string quarterback
Kevin McDougal.

“They have the state—Of—the-art
power offense in football today,"
Hackett said. “Rick Mirer is_in
more control of the offense this
year than when we faced him last
year. He benefits from the strong
running game. He does not burn
you with his speed, but he can
get you with a quick move when
he needs to.”

The loss of the game was not
the only blow that the Panthers
suffered in Notre Dame. They
lost starting tailback Curtis Martin

after the first series to a sprained
big toe. Martin is listed as doubtful
for the upcoming Syracuse game.

“He was not able to even put
weight on-it when he came out,"
llackett said. “He got hurt the
very first play ofthe game. I think
he’ll be back as soon as he
possibly can.”

The already thin backfield also
lost running back Glenn Deveaux
to :1 sprained ankle later in the
game. He, too, is listed as
doubtful.

“We need resiliency to bounce
back from this,” Hackett said.

t“’l'he seniors carried us Over the

summer through all the problems,
and we need them to step forward
and lead us again.”

Rugby blanks CM, 54-0

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

The Panther Rugby Football Club remained undefeated with
a 54-0 trouncing of the Carnegie Mellon team Saturday in Lower
Frick Park.

Seven players scored for the 2-0 Panthers, who have a new
coach and new style of play. Jerry I larper, -Don lluber and Mike
Dewitt each tallied two tries (scores) apiece, while Tim Mraz,
Neil Scott, john Lewis andjohn 'l'omc:I.ak added one each. The
after tries (like an extra point in football) were provided by
Brian I lannen and Emil Nagengast. Nagengast replaced Hannen
after a first—half injury.

“The game waswell—contested, but they are not as well-
coached as we are,” sai Pitt captain Bill Reed.

Pitt’s new coach, Tim Miller, is the Allegheny Rugby Union’s
college coordinator. lewis Credits Miller for bringing organization
to the team. “l le’s done a really good job of getting us ready,"
Lewis said. “We're still a little rusty; we had a lot of dropped
balls, but it was a good afternoon of rugby.”

Miller previously coached rugby at llaverford College in

eastern Pennsylvania. According to Lewis, Miller is shaping the
team’s style after the U8. national team, which lewis described
as more straight—forward. “lt’s different from the way we played
last year,” he said.

“lt’s much more disciplined and organized than last year,”
Reed said. “lMillerl is very concerned with presenting a positive
image for Pitt.”

112/olleybozll defers T/irginiaforﬁ/"z‘b5tm

By Ryan Buncher
Staff Writer

Despite a strong Virginia
defense, confusion on its own
defense and the latest bad luck to
strike the team, the Pitt volleyball
team won its fifth straight match
Saturday. ,

The Panthers struggled in the
first game, trailing 11-14 before
coming back to win 16-14. Pitt

had some problems with‘

miscommunication on defense,
which head coach Sue Woodstra
attributed to some changes they
are making. '

“We’re doing some things
differently defensively,” Woodstra
said. “We’re changing our
defenses around a little bit,
changing some responsibilities.
For the most part, I think it «was
good?

Pitt took advantage of Virginia
‘errors to take the second game
15-10. The Panthers dominated
play in the third game, charging
out to a 13-3 lead and struggling
a bit before winning it 15-6.

“Once we had control of the
match, we started to slack off a
bit," Woodstra said.

The team is winning again,
with its record now at 1 1-5 (1-0 in
the Big East), but it still isn’t
healthy.

Senior co—captain Sue
Zonneville still isn’t totally
recovered from mono. At times
she was limited to playing front
row, with ﬁrst-year player Chelsea
Hemingway playing back row.

“Sometimes I feel it,” Zonneville

, said. “Aerobically, I'm notreally
: back into it yet.”

Backup outside hitter Bridget
Gary missed the match against
UVA due to food poisoning.

“I hope that's everything that

. could go on," Woodstra said. “I

know there will be something
else. These things happen to every
team. People go down. They
come back. Other people go
down. I think the team’s done

3 pretty well to battle back, using
people in different ways.”

Zonneville’s play time may have

30°/0

ig/9 1‘ win
been a bit limited, but she had a
strong match when she was in
there, with 11 kills and only one
error on the way to a team-high

kill percentage of .400.
Linda Zols and Ann Marie

Lucanie also had 11 kills, with

Lucanie also racking up 13 digs.
Heather Hollands continued her
solid play, with seven kills, one
error and a team-leading 15 digs.

Virginia, whose record fell to
11-9,. entered the game as an
unknown to Pitt.

“We didn’t know what to expect
because we hadn't heard much
from them,” Zonneville said. “We
knew they had some good outside
hitters. They are very good
defensively. They dug balls that
normally would go down against
the Big East teams.”

One of those outside hitters, 6-
foot, 1-inch senior Gretajansson,
gave the Panthers a very hard
time with 14 kills, one error and
an outstanding kill percentage of
.464.

Anne Marie Hammers lead the
Cavs in digs with 17, but she ‘also
had six errors to only ﬁve kills
and a percentage of -.034. Junior
middle hitter Dana Spencer had
five errors and zero -kills (—.238
percentage), and ﬁrst—year outside
hitter Amy Peters had a
percentage of -.308. That was
indicative of the whole team,
which ended up with a
percentage of .077. _

Next up for the»Panthers is a
stretch of four matches in three
games this weekend -— three
against Big East teams. They go
to Boston College Friday,
Providence Saturday afternoon,
Rhode Island Saturday night and
Connecticut Sunday. '

“Physically, I think ‘we’re in
pretty good shape. We have
people coming back. The last
three weeks have been pretty
good workouts — at least the last
two and a half weeks, maybe up
to Wednesday. The girls are in
pretty good shape. Mentally, we're
in good shape. We’re ready to
start playing these teams.

A, Pens’ slo

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

Four puck games into the
season and the Pittsburgh
Penguins are in fourth place -in
the Patrick Division. Worried?
Maybe they’re slippin’. “No repeat
this year,” yOu’re thinking. Don’t
fret, it’s a foolish thought. The
Pens have come out of the box
and played solid hockey, although
Saturday afternOon’s whupping
in New Jersey might say
differently. I

The new-faced Devils are really

the old Devils in disguise.
Newcomers Scott Stevens,
Stephan Richer, Claude Vilgrain
and Tom Chorske all. seem to
have molded well into the
brui-sing style of hockey the Devils
are known for. Physical,
Occasionally cheap, but always
Icausing problems for the
Penguins.
On Saturday a pair of Claudes
got the Devils in front early.

Claude Lemieux drilled a 30-
footer off left wing Claude
Vilgrain’s ankle, and the puck
took a strange hop between Tom
Barrasso’s pads into the meshing
behind him._ While the high-
powered Pen line of Mario
Lemieux, Mark Recchi and Kevin
Stevens seemed to be napping,
Jaromir Jagr, Jiri Hrdina and Phil
Bourque continued to play
aggressively. They nearly
converted on a couple of first-
period shifts, only to be stymied
by Devil goalie Chris Terreri,
who went basically untested the
rest of the day.

New Jersey came out for the
second period like gang—busters,
swarming the Penguin net and
finally beating netminder
Barrasso. Richer netted his fourth
of the season, chipping a loose
puck under the sprawled goalie
after Gordie Roberts went off for
a five-minute major for high-
sticking. The Pens got back what
looked to be a huge goal as Paul

Coffey moved a step closer to
immortality by blasting a shot
from 15 feet past Terreri, But the
Devils answered late in the period
as Lemieux took a great clearing
pass from Stevens (that’s Claude
from Scott), raced in two—on-one
and smoked one high and off the
far post of the Penguin net.

New Jersey cruised from there,
eliminating any Penguin Offense
with excellent forechecking. The
Pens almost seemed willing to
except what little the Devil
defense was offering them. Peter
Stasny iced the victory from 75
feet into an empty Penguin cage,
and the Devils went to 4-0 On the
young season, while the Pens
dropped to 2-1-1.

The Devils appear to be for ‘

real. Coach T om McVie has ‘em
playin’ solid two—way hockey with
four-deep lines‘ and an
outstanding corps of blueliners.
Richer is a massive pickup for
N]. He’s a guaranteed 30-goal
scorer, but a possible 60-goal

to start not indicative 0fteam’s play

man if happy. He appears to be
thriving in the Meadowlands as
the marquis scorer.

Though the Pens struggled in
N.J., on Thursday eve in
Philadelphia, the Pens put
together their finest performance
of theseason.

Larry Murphy scored two times,
and the checking line of Brian
Trottier, Bob Errey andjoe Mullen
dominated as Pittsburgh spoiled
the Flyers’ home opener 6-3.
Trottier continued to prove his
immeasurable value to the squad
with a goal and an assist to get the
group jumpin’ Off to a 2-0 lead.

Jaromir Jagr is still looking for
his first goal of the season, but his
passing has been superb.’He set
up Coffey for the Pens’ third goal
after swerving through two Flyer
defensemen, then sweeping a
perfect pass to a streaking Coffey,
who lifted it Over Ken Wregget.

Scotty Bowman’s troops appear
to be schooled. They’ve learned
to listen and learn and remain

what appears to be a coachable
unit. Barrasso has been splendid
in the nets, coming out of camp
the strongest he’s ever been as a
Pen. The defense is deep and
playing smart, fundamental puck,
while the offense is not a worry.

The Pens still need to sign Ronnie

Francis.

Bowman has been going with
only three lines which are fine for
the time being, but as the season
goes on and inevitable injuries

occur, an all-star like Francis is a I

must. Francis could also play
with Jagr and Bourque, allowing
Hrdina to team with Troy Loney
and whoever on a fourth line.

The Pens might not win the 

division without him and the
options he could give them.
Pittsburgh takes its Patrick road
show to Long Island on Tuesday
to face the hapless New York
Islanders. The Pens have played

three straight division games and _

follow with four of their next-five
against the tough division.

Special
- Continued from page 10

Not only had the return game
been consistently good, but the
coverage teams had also been
excellent. Pitt has allowed
opponents an average of six yards
a punt return and just over 23
yards a kickoff return. But Notre
Dame came up with the big plays
on’ special teams on Saturday
and left Pitt behind. “The blocked
punt was critical,” said Irish head
coach Lou Holtz. ‘_‘It' was a
designed play to block it.”

If that was the case, the play
came off smoothly for ND, as
Reggie Brooks burst around the

Pitt line untouched. He smothered
Theodorou’s kick and recovered
the ball in the corner of the end
zone for the score. “We had a
base set of rules [for punt
blockingl,” Hackett said, “and we
got fooled. What’s' so frustrating

for me is that for five weeks »

we’ve probably had no one even
close [to blocking a punt].”

And it couldn’t have come at a
worse time. The Panthers were
down 7-0‘ in the second quarter
and looking impressive
defensively against a powerful

Notre Dame team. “To have one V

in aball game of this magnitude

and that place in the field (Pitt’s
26-yard line), that’s a big play,”
Hackett said.

But perhaps it wasn’t very

surprising. Theodorou was

punting for the eighth time this
season. For the second week in a
row, the walk-on sophomore
handled the punting chores in
place of the suspended Kevin
Leon. What might have been
more surprising was to see Israel
drop the ball on a punt just 11
plays earlier, The senior from
Haddonfield, N.J., had not
dropped a punt. all year before
Craig Hentrich’s kick bounced

away from him at the Pitt 31-yard
line. ND’s Irv Smith recovered,
and soon after fullback Jerome
Bettis scored to put the Irish on
top, 7-0. “Steve Israel is normally
a sure-handed guy,” Hackett said.

The coverage team showed
that it could have a bad day, too.
On the opening kickoff of the
second half, Reggie Brooks once
again put Pitt in a hole by
returning the kick out to midfield.
Not all of the coverage problems
could be blamed on Pitt, though.
“Our [special teams] had a very
productive day,” Holtz said.
“That’s the best we’ve -blocked

The Irish got good special-team
play throughout. They downed
one of their punts at the Pitt one-
yard line and limited Israel to Oné
kick return over 17 yards.

For Pitt, it was a game of
mistakes on special teams, and
that contributed to its downfall as
much as any other phase of the
game. “It was just like a, chain,”

Hackett said. “Boom! We fumble .

the punt. Then boom! They block,

Out

Continued from page 1
Perhaps Jesus was the ultimate bisexual,"
Hawk said.

He invited members of the audience to
explore their own spirituality.

“To really live, one must begin to affirm
oneself. Live as you were called to live.
Dance the dance of life,” he said.

BiGALA co-President Melissa Smith said
coming out is important for the gay
community because “we're invisible. You
can't tell if a person's gay just because of
what we look like  People don't think
they know anyone who’s gay You can't
ignore us, We're here. There's millions
and millions of us in the United States.”

A Kinsey Institute study has estimated
10 percent of the US. population is
homosexual.

She responded to the criticism that
homosexuality is wrong because it is
“unnatural.” “Is this natural, not to show
affection? It is unnatural not to express
feelings for people_you love," Smith said.

The BiGAI.A information table extended ‘

support to gay students who haven’t “come
out of the closet,” Smith said. “It's
empowering if you are closeted and you

come out of class and see a table for
people who are bisexual, gay or lesbian."

Being in the closet is “hell,” according to
BiGALA co-President Todd Kinavey

"People assume you're straight and say
homophobic things. It's empowering to
say, ‘You're not going to tell me how to
live my life. I'm gay.’ I'm not ashamed of
it," Kinavey said.

At the meeting Friday BiGALA member
Scott Nespor described his coming-out
process.‘

“I always knew I was gay. I always
knew I was really different. I was raised in
the Church, and it was an abomination. I
didn't want to be an abomination to God,
but I had these feelings, and there was no
way to stop them.”

His parents kicked him out ofthe house
for the weekend when he told them he
was gay.

“They made me promise that when I
came to college I wouldn't do anything
like this, join BiGALA. But I’m here,” he
said.

Kindergarten teacher Tony Woods said
he has been coming out since he was 6
years old.

I lc said he came out to his mother when
he was in high school. Woods was on his
way to a Lou Reed concert and tried to
sneak out of the house with pink-orange
hair, heavy theatrical makeup, a white,
full—length, fake fur and black, skintight
pants.

“My mother saw me and said, ‘What are
you, a big queer?’ I said, ‘No, Mom, I'm just
a little one,’ and ieft.” She has since

accepted his homosexuality but not his 
husband, who is black, according to 

Kinavey.

Woods said coming out meant

. developing pride in himself. ,

“I show shame when I closet myself :
When I’rn out, loud and proud, then:
people know there's no shame,” \X’oods 

said.

I-‘ree-lance writerjohn Kurlevich is suing
a former employer for demoting and firing
him for being openly gay. I le talked about
the growing strength of the gay community
in Pittsburgh.

“We're ﬂexing our muscles in this city
for the first time,” he said.

lliGAl.A members criticized Christian
churches for using the euphemism “pro-

family” to mean “anti-gay.” Gay people
also have families, they said.

The groups also attacked state Rep.
Ron Gamble for condemning ‘the
Pittsburgh (}ay..and Lesbian Film Festival
as promoting “illegal and immoral”
activity.
