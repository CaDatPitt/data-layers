' ithelocal plan, A A ~ -

j Rosenhain said in part in his art-
icle:-A A“AThe range of industrial ﬁelds
is so ‘widethat there is room for far
more workthan the institute can‘ un-
dertake without recurring — to ﬁelds

A already dealt with. Also, ﬁrms do not

seem diposed to abandon the ﬁeld of
researc_hV upon which theyhave. em-
barked, andfrequently. a series of re;
search fellows are-employed to con-

tinue research in _a given‘ ﬁeld for a.

considerable number of years, the men

passing into the direct service of the ‘
,industr'y'as:thAe results of their work

come to betranslated into industrial
"practice. 5 . . V

7 “The” institute thus serves -not" only
asV‘a research laboratory for dealing
with industrial problems, but also as

‘a ‘training ground for men who after-«

wards apply scientiﬁc methods’ and
results within the industries them-
selves.’ ' ’  '

“There can be -no doubt that the
institute thus renders most valuable
service, and if this is ‘supplemented,
as isnow to be the case, by more
fundamental research work initiated
by the institute itself, that service
will be increasingly effective. Actual-
-ly, secrecy is" not so universally in-
sisted» upon as might be imagined, and
a considerable number of the re-
searches ‘con’duct_ed in the~Me1lon In-

.stitute are more or less completely
V described in scientiﬁc and technical
papers published by past or presen

research fellows." .
