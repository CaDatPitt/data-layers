WPTS celebrates firstanniversary
as professional FM radio station

By Nadia Moritz
Features Editor

Saturday marked the , first
anniversary of Pitt’s radio station,
WPTS-98.5 FM, and to celebrate, a
party was held on the William Pitt
Union lawn.

Despite the humidity, the
gathering attracted more 8 than. 250
students and nine bands. The live
music and dancing continued from 1
p.m. until ll p.m., with a very
enthusiastic and exhausted WPTS
staff setting _ up‘ stages and
performing live air shows.

‘ “The whole thing was a raving
success,” said station manager Chris
Kramer. “Nothing of this caliber has
been done in Pittsburgh for a long
time. This day has generated so
much excitement on the staff.”

But according to Kramer and
WP-'I'S’s program director, Theresa
Colaizzi, running a professional
radio station is not always easy or
much fun.

“At a college radio station, people
are there to get experience, but on
the same hand, they have a lot of
other r,espo_nsibilities,’_’— ‘. said

'“At a college radio station, people are there to get

Colaizzi. “And then there are those
who are there just to have fun, and
that conﬂicts with the professional
format of the station.”

“It’s a college station, but you
have to learn how to do professional
work,” added Kramer. “You can’t
just goof around.”

Another problem, Colaizzi said, is
dealing with the sometimes volatile
emotional nature of college-age
workers. “The emotions get mixed
in with the professionalism,” said

_ Colaizzi.

But according to Kramer, peer
pressure helps to keep everyone in
line. “Even though people get
emotional -and lose their

. professional .gra§p,_s,ometi1nes,,. we

can usually keep things In control
through communication. There is
always a reason why, and it is always
for the good of the station,” said
Kramer.

“Everyone usually understands
that, and. we’re at the point now
where we are more like a family, so
peer pressure keeps everyone
working . for the family cause,"
Kramer said. g '

Prior to last August, WPTS was a
student-owned, student-operated
radio station, operating on Carrier
Current, a type of cable radio
transmittable only to the Pitt dorms.
The idea originated about seven
years ago, according to _Kramer,

Pittcombats disease through immunization clinic S  
Measles hits campuses

By David Zafris
The Pitt News

The Allegheny County Health
Department is holding a free
immunization clinic for Pitt
students on Sept. I2 in the Litchﬁeld.
Towers Lobby from ll a.m. to 2
p.m.

“We would like to make it a
requirement, but we really can’t

enforce it,” said Dr. Pamela Bowen, A

medical administrator of Student
Health Services. “We strongly
recommend that students be
vaccinated.”

College students have an
increased risk of contracting
vaccine-preventable infections. In
I983, the University of Illinois at
Bloomington had a large measles
outburst. Bowen attributes, this to a
short-lasting vaccine. “Any people
given measles shots prior to I969 are
not immune,” Bowen said. “That’s
why we're having outbreaks on

college campuses."

Since children generally receive
measles shots before their second
birthday, most of today’s college
students were immunized prior to
1969. “Measles is an extremely
serious illness. That’s the one we’re
most concerned about,” Bowen said.

Other diseases against which

students will be vaccinated include -

mumps, rubella (German measles),
tetanus and diphtheria. Measles,
mumps and rubella vaccines are
given in one shot, tetanus and
diphtheria in another. Polio
vaccines will also be administered.
However, no student should receive
more than two shots.

The free clinics have been held
since 1981 and usually attract less
than 200 students. “We’re hoping for
a larger turnout this year," Bowen
said.

Many students are hesitant to be
immunized because of the side
effects of the vaccines. These side

Symphony opens
59th concert season

By David Zuchowski
The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Symphony, after
returning from a successful summer
European tour, will open its 59th
concert season on Sept. l3, i985.
The 24-concert season is heavily
weighted toward the traditional and
classical repertoire of Beethoven,
Mozart, Brahms and Bach. Some of
the more contemporary composers,
however, such as Shostakovich,
Prokofiev, Ives and Schwantner,
will also be represented.

The symphony will perform under
the aegis of Lorin Maazel, who will
assume the duties of music consul-
tant and also conduct the orchestra
in two concerts. Twelve guest con-
ductors will lead the symphony for
the remaining 22 concerts.

V A A special student subscription ser-

-

 

ies has been designed this year, offer-
ing eight Sunday afternoon concerts
for $28, or just $3.50 per concert.

' Four performances have been sche-

duled for each semester, and the
dates_ have been carefully chosen to
avoid scheduling them concurrently
with final exams. Call 392-4821 for
information on student subscrip-
tions.

Highlights of the 1985-86 season,
several of which are included in the

student subscription, are: guest
artists, guest conductors and major
compositions.

effects range from soreness and
redness in the immediate area of the
shot to a slight fever and discomfort
in the joints. But usually these
reactions are temporary and
relatively mild. .And each.student
must sign a consent form before
being immunized.

If unable to attend the
immunization clinic on Sept. 12,
students are urged to visit the
Allegheny County Health
Department, 3333 Forbes Ave.,' for
free immunization, Monday
through Friday, 9-1] a.m. and

Service will be holding another
immunization clinic during the

. record. A second vaccine will do no

harm. “When in doubt --

immunize,” she said.

By Lisa Podrat
Staff Writer

Measles, once thought of only as a childhood disease, has taken its toll on ‘ I

college campuses throughout the country. According to Dr. Frederick
Rubin, associate head of Monteﬁore Hospital’s infectious disease unit lab,
measles will continue to affect college campuses unless university officials
come together with a strict immunization policy.

“Every country in the world but the United States has measles as a '

prevalent disease. The United States has almost whipped measles. There
used to be tens of thousands of cases a year, and now, there are several

hundred cases a year. So we’re right at the point where we can just about see 3
it disappear in this country — except for outbreaks ‘on college campuses.”

According to the July 26, 1985 issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, college campuses are excellent targets for measles outbreaks for
several reasons. First, in the 1960s and early 1970s, when the first measles
vaccine was administered to children, many never received the vaccine.

Some were not vaccinated because their elementary schools did not require

an immunization against measles.

Those who did receive theevaccine were vaccinated with a “killed vaccine” “

—— which was later found to give only temporary immunity to measles. Some
of these patients were never alerted by their doctors to get the new “live

vaccine. ”

Thailand government overthrown in coup

BANGKOK, Thailand (UPI) —
Thailand’s government has
apparently been overthrown in a
military coup. A group of military
commanders, identifying themselves
as members of the “Revolutionary
Party,” took over major radio
stations in Bangkok and announced
that they overthrew the goverment
of Prime Minister Prem
Tinsulanonda. The prime minister
was out of the country. As tanks
rolled up to government buildings,
the coup organizers warned military
personnel and police against
interfering with the takeover.

Banned groups
to meet in S.A.

(UPI) — Some South African
businessmen plan to meet with
leaders of a banned black nationalist
group sometime next week.
However, President Pieter Botha
warnedthat it would be “unwise and
even disloyal" for. white
businessmen to meet with black
African National Congress leaders
in Zambia. The nationalist group
called for the meeting in a bid to
curb racial unrest in South Africa.

The New York Times reported

that President Reagan may take
action today to head off
congressionally imposed sanctions
against Pretoria, South Africa.
Administration officials reportedly
said Reagan may announce a ban on
the sale of gold Krugerrands if he
gets an OK from the general
agreement on tariffs and trade.

No comment from Pretoria on a -

report that the South African
government is considering ' a
partition of that mineral-rich

country.‘ According to the black
newspaper City Press, the plan calls
for creation of three black states on
the southern tip of Africa to be
divided by a white-ruled corridor
containing the nation's mineral
wealth.

Plane crash
cause sought

(UPI) — Federal investigators
looking into the crash of ajetliner in
Milwaukee have found some

important clues that could help
pinpoint the cause. They found parts
of an engine along the runway that
was used by the Midwest Express
DC-9 just before it crashed at Billy
Mitchell Field on Friday, killing all

31 .people aboard. It was not
immediately known whether the
engine parts were from the DC-9 or
from some other malfunctioning
plane. It was determined, however,
that the parts were from the same
kind of engine on the Midwest
Express plane.

Gas damages
immune systems

(UPI) -— A Pittsburgh researcher
said a poisonous gas leak at a Union
Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, may
leave some of the 2,000 injured with
permanently damaged immune
systems. Seventeen-hundred people
died in the gas leak last December.
Dr. Meryl Karol issued a report on
the method for studying the
after-effects of the disaster in a paper
presented today.

Employee shot

(UPI) — The Press Trust of India
reported that Sikh gunmen shot and
killed an employee of the ruling
Congress Party in Punjab state
yesterday. The killing raised fears
that Sikh militants may try to

disrupt elections later this month.
The state-run news agency quoted
local authorities who said two
unidentified Sikh youths shot the
employee about 225 miles northwest
of New Delhi and escaped on a
motorscooter.

Troops sought

(UPI) — A Lebanese official is
asking Syria to send troops into west
Beirut. The request from a moderate
Sunni Moslem envoy to Damascus
came one day after Syrian troops
began helping to keep order in a
Christian town in eastern Lebanon.
There was no immediate response
from Syria to the appeal for military
intervention.

Pope blasts
abortion

(UPI) In his strongest
anti-abortion statements since
becoming pontiff seven years ago,
Pope John Paul called abortion a
“repulsive crime” yesterday. The
pontiff made those statements in a

nine-and-a-half-hour visit to
Lichtenstein, a tiny European
principality considering

liberalization of its anti-abortion
laws.

The Pitt News - September 9, 198S

Students advised to mark valuables ..

in effort to prevent loss by theft

Students living on campus may
have brought typewriters, stereos,
televisions, musical instruments or
even personal computers with them.
However, protecting these items
from loss because oftheft is often an
overlooked task.

The Society of Chartered Prop-
erty and Casualty Underwriters has
devised a list of tips for college stu-
dents on how to protect against
crime on campus.

The first step for students is to
have valuable belongings engraved
and registered at the local police sta-
tion. Students can stop by the police
department either at home or in

their college town and fill out a few '

forms. The participating police
department will issue a number and
register it on a card file. Then, this
number can 'be engraved on the
items to be protected. Items can also
be protected by having a social
security number or some other iden-
tifying number engraved on them.
Marked items are less likely to be
stolen. Burglars are interested in
reselling the merchandise for quick
money, and /those who buy and sell
stolen goods will not buy goods with
engraved numbers on them.
Students should‘ keep a record of
their assigned number, serial
number, the locations of each item,
the name of the manufacturer and
the model name of each piece being
engraved. It is a good idea to make

putt

ou CII

DDCCDNF

three copies of this list, keeping one
in a safe deposit box, one at home
and one at school. If goods are
stolen, there will be information
about them ready to give to the
police.

Engraving property can help re-
cover it or deter a thief from taking
those articles, but there are other
ways to make a campus room an
unlikely target for a thief. The fol-
lowing tips can help college students
-prevent loss due to theft.

0Don’t go anywhere without lock-
ing your door, even if you live in a
dorm and are just going down the
hall for a minute. It’s easy for some-
one to walk in, take money or
jewelry and be gone in seconds.

0Don’t store money in such
obvious places as desk drawers, and
don’t leave jewelry on top of furni-
ture. The harder it is for a thief to
find valuables, the more likely it is
the intruder will give up and move
on to an easier target.

0Don’t tell friends where you keep
money. They may mention the hid-
ing place to the wrong person. In
most crimes, the criminal and victim
know each other. ,

0Don’t list your room number
when advertising for rugs, books or
rides. First name and phone number

are sufficient. The moreinformation ‘

about what’s in your room and when
you won’t be there, the easier it is for

a thief to steal your valuables.

0Many criminals know when a
local college is off for a week or so
and will choose this time to break in.
First-ﬂoor rooms are especially
vulnerable. It is important to close
curtains, lock windows and put the
stereo in the closet or under the bed.
Then cover it with a blanket or put it
behind something to make it harder
for the burglar to find. A burglar will
strike the easiest target — the rooms
with open curtains and a stereo in
plain view.

0Make sure that you have ade-
quate insurance. Typically, parents’
homeowners policy will cover prop-
erty stolen away from home up to a
limit of 10 percent of the contents’
coverage. For example, if a family is
insured for $60,000 for their house,
they are insured for $30,000 for the
contents of the house. This means
that there is up to $3,000 of insur-
ance coverage, minus the amount of
the deductible in the policy, for
belongings at school.

There are also specific dollar lim-
its on certain kinds of property,
including watches, jewelry and cash.
Be sure to ask your insurance agent
what is the exact amount of "cover-
age you have. If there is not enough
coverage for thevaluables kept at
school, students will" need to buy a
special individual policy called a
ﬂoater. .

Morbidity and Mortality stated, “In May 1983, the American College
Health Association adopted a pre-admission immunization policy, recom-
mending that, by September 1985, colleges and universities require all
students to present documentation of immunity to measles and other
vaccine-preventable diseases as a prerequisite to matriculation or registra-
tion. The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee has likewise recom-
mended since 1980 that college and university administrations strongly
consider establishing such requirements."

Despite these recommendations, a 1984 survey revealed that only 16
percent of 1,86] surveyed colleges required their students to take measles and
rubella shots before they could attend. '

All-American hustle

Yesterday, Pete Rose, player/ manager for the Cin-
cinnati Reds and veteran of 23 seasons, singled to right
center field off of Chicago Cubs pitcher Reggie Patterson
to tie the record for career base hits. This is a record, set
by Ty Cobb of the Detriot Tigers in 1928, thought by
many for many years to be unbreakable. Rose now is in a
position to prove them wrong. He has been known for
years as a unique player with a drive to win that is beyond
comprehension. He’s also been known as a player of the
old school. He appears to love the game at least as much
as himself.

‘The point is that this is baseball, a sport that is hope-
lessly tied to American culture. Youth in America once
looked to baseball for inspiration and a set of values to
which they could aspire. Today, kids look to baseball for

V the latest scandal or depraved economic scheme.

Today, the game is different. It reflects change in our
culture — a shift of values. It, like Hollywood and the
presidency, has lost its innocence.

This is not to say that Pete Rose or the players of
yesteryear actually differ in substance or character from
today’s players. The point is that it appears that way and
not by accident. ‘

There was a time, we’re told, when players saw far
enough beyond their own egotism to recognize the
responsibility inherent in the player/ fan relationship.
The fan agrees to clap and make the player wealthy. The
player in turn agrees to play hard and clean, and not
embarrass the fan in front of his/ her children by letting
his greed or vices reach the headlines.

Rose is one of a dying breed who understands this. He
has been criticized lately for capitalizing on his impend-
ing record, but what, other than baseball, could be more
American than that? He has nonetheless held up his end
of thedeal. He’s performed with an underlying respect for
the game and the people who watch it. Along the way he’s

V made the record books. He’s also brought back the plea-

santry of saying “to the winner goes the spoils!”

Simply Speaking/George Kresak

Conscience: asset orinconvenience

Very early in life, we come to
know guilt. Thereafter, at every
turn, feelings of shame creep
insidiously through the human

psyche and, in no time, an individual -

will have acquired a fully-developed,
autocratic conscience. Signiﬁcantly,
the conscience has come to exert
even greater control over human
behavior than either. MTV" or a
tight pair of jockey shorts.

Simply put, the human conscience
(much like studio wrestling) is, to a
large degree, a side effect of the
attempts by the forces of civilization
to conquer the ‘willful human spirit.
More than anything, the conscience
is responsible for the confused and
chaotic state of passions that are the
human experience. This we must
recognize before trooping
light-heartedly off to the
marketplace with cash in hands and
smiles on our faces.

‘ Very often, cases of neuroses and
psychoses can be traced to a
zealously rigid and stem conscience
and unresolved feelings of guilt. For

instance, I’ve always felt that my
brother’s obsession with power tools
and metaphysics is directly
attributable to his overwhelming
sense of guilt for having neglected to
build a fashionable wardrobe. ’

Sanity belongs to none but those
whose consciences have been thrust
neatly "aside, thereby allowing the
free and gleeful expression of the
baser instincts known to
humankind. These may include
singing “My Sharona” at the corner
of a busy intersection or drooling on
oneself unabashedly while dining at
a fine restaurant. Invariably, to
those natures that are essentially
guiltless belong happiness and
probably some form of venereal
disease. '

' I know of few such people. My
friend Franz is one. Innocent and
childlike, he is free of the anxieties
that plague modern man and he
rarely finds cause to perform acts of
violence upon himself or others. But
Franz is a bad example, as he has

been in a coma for the past ﬁve
years.

One other person comes vividly to
mind. While others choose to vilify
Madonna for what is judged to be
lewd behavior and a poorly
developed fashion sense, I find that
I must commend her on her healthy
and_ sane approach to her own
sexuality. Hers is the kind of
guiltless self-indulgence that leads to
tranquility and contentment.
Unfortunately, it will also often lead
to pregnancy and obesity, but who
said that life was entirely free of its
little trade-offs?

Perhaps it is time we junk the

harsh standards of morality. lrres- .

ponsible pleasure-seeking seems
inﬁnitely wiser than a course of
self-denial and virtue, and it requires
less stamina. If I'm not mistaken,
the human soul has long been
thirsting for an. orgy of sensual
delight. However, I could be wrong,
in which case we should all meet at
Three Rivers Stadiuim for a Pirate
baseball game.

with a petition to the university. “We
said, ‘Hey, we are the biggest school
in Pittsburgh. Why don't we have a
station.’ ”

Last August, however, the
university officially purchased the
station’s non-profit broadcast
license. Now, Kramer claims that
WPTS is the most professional
student radio station in the city.

Colaizzi attributes this partly to
the fact that both she and Kramer
have outside communication
positions. Colaizzi is presently
working at WWSW-F M, while
Kramer is at WJ PA in Washington
County.

“No one here is teaching us, plus
Pitt doesn’t even have a
broadcasting program,” said
Colaizzi. “We need the input from
the professional radio stations to
help us operate as a professional
radio station.”

Both Colaizzi and Kramer did
note, though, that the competitive
atmosphere in the professional
stations is much less intense and
more cooperative.

“Everyone does their jobs without
complaining, and if they don’t,
someone else picks it up without
complaining,” said Colaizzi. “But I
think the power struggle is present
more in college media because this is
where you start off. This is where the
competition begins.”

because it‘s preprogrammed

“We started out
playing the same stuff as
the commercial stations
like WD VE, but we went
in our own direction.
Now we are ahead of

WD VE in terms of when
we get the new music.”
— Chris Kramer
Station Director, WPTS

WPTS’ location on the FM radio
dial provides an added incentive to
maintain professionalism.

“We are right in the middle of the
dial. If we screw up, people are going
to hear it,” said Colaizzi. “[W]RCT
is at the end of the dial. If they screw
up, no one is necessarily going to
hear them. We’re in the middle of the

biggest commercial stations in
Pittsburgh.”
WPTS is located between

WHYW-“Y97” FM and WISH-100
FM. According to Kramer, WPTS
is the only college radio station in
the country between two prime
commercial stations. A

tions — like definite integrals,

the station running along
professional lines. “Since our
administration owns the license, we
have to be more careful in order to
keep the station student-operated,”
said Kramer. “We can’t screw up on
the air.”

So far, WPTS has not had many
encounters with “screw-ups” on the
air. The worst encounter occurred
when one of the disc jockies
accidentally fell asleep during his air
shift. But in most cases, Kramer
said, the staff has been overly
enthusiastic and increasingly
professional.

The development of a consistent
style of music has recently been met
with more enthusiasm, respect and
cooperation. “Every jock has his
own tastes, and when we first
started, we were free-form and
everyone was allowed to play his
own tastes, but now we have to form
a consistency,” said Kramer. “If we
didn’t have a constant sound, we
would not be able to go anywhere.”

The sound of WPTS is one that
Kramer refers to as eclectic,
progressive and album-oriented
rock. “We’re eclectic because we
play a diversity of music. Our
audience is college students, who are
diverse in themselves,” said Kramer.
“We’re progressive because we play
the new stuff, and we don’t just play
single hits, we play albums.”

The musical blend of WPTS,
Kramer said, is the newest ofthe new
music as well as commercial pop.
“We don't play any heavy metal,”
said Kramer. “It doesn't mix well.

“We started out playing the same
stuff as the commercial stations_ like
[W]DVE,” continued Kramer. “But
we went on our own direction. Now '
we are ahead of WDVE in terms of
when we get the new music.”

Being a non-profit student radio
station is also advantageous in terms
of experimentation. “We can

Kramer. “For instance, we recently
added urban music to our program.”

This experimentation also
extends itself into the underwriting
operations of the station.
Underwriting is a restricted form of
commercial message that involves
small grants to the station and is a
source of income for the station.

“Not having to worry about
advertisers allows us to be more
creative and employ more ingenuity
and discretion with the presentation
of underwriting,” said Kramer. I

This year,xthe university has also
hired a professional news director to
teach new writing to the WPTS
staff. But the main thing, according
to Kramer, is that the WPTS staff
gains as much experience as possible
and is able to secure the bestjobs. He
is conﬁdent that this, too, is
improving the station. _

“We train our people better here
than in any other "radio station
because we have to do things
professionally and at the same time
have to do things on our own,” said
Kramer. “But I have people getting
internships all over the city, and that
is what’s important, getting people
hired. After that, it's OK to have

fun.” WilliamiPitt.Union lawn.

most recorded classical instrumen-
talist in history. He has been
awarded the Grand Prix du Disque
for a number of his recordings and
has achieved remarkable success on
television and has appeared on “The
Tonight Show,” “Merv Griffin,”
“Dick Cavett,”CBS’s “60 Minutes,"
and PBS’s “Gala of Stars.”
Rampal has performed with virtu-
ally every major American orches-

'4 tra, and since his conducting debut _

at the Mostly Mozart Festival in
New York, he has led orchestras in
the United States, Europe and
Japan. He will perform Bach's
“Flute Concerto in C Major” this
season in Pittsburgh.

Isaac Stern — One of the most
inﬂuential cultural forces here and
abroad, and one of the foremost
violinists of this century, Stern’s
concerts are invariably sell-outs, and
many of his best-selling recordings
on CBS Masterworks have earned

_ Grammy Awards.

He began his career in San Fran-
cisco and, in 1936 made his San

 Francisco debut playing the Brahms

“Concerto.” Other debuts include
the New York Symphony in 1937,

Carnegie Hall in 1943 and the New

York Philharmonic in 1944. He is an

‘ avowed champion of contemporary

music, having performed premieres
by Bernstein, Hindemith, Pande-
recki, Rochberg and Schuman. In
Pittsburgh, he will perform Brahms’

. “Violin Concerto” this season.

Andre Watts -— Born in Nurn-
berg, Germany, he is the son of a
black American GI and his Hungar-

‘ ian wife. Watts began playing his

first musical instrument, a miniature
violin, by age 4. At age 6, he chose
the piano over the violin and, at age
9, won a competition entitling him
to play a Hayden concerto at a Phil-
adelphia Orchestra children’s con-
cert. At l0, he was selected to to play
the Mendelssohn “G minor Con-
certo” on the orchestra’s series at
Robin Hood Dell. He returned at
age l4 to play the Franck “Sym-
phonic Variations” in the Philadel-
phia winter subscription series.

At 16, Watts was introduced to
CBS television viewers as soloist for
a New York Philharmonic young
people’s concert and three weeks
later was presented by Leonard
Bernstein to the philharmonic’s reg-
ular subscribers as a last-minute
substitute for the ailing Glenn
Gould. In the ensuing three years, he
made sensationally successful
appearances in recitals in most of the

major United States cities and as a '

soloist with a dozen major sym-
phony orchestras.

. This season, he will perform

Liszt’s “Piano Concerto No. 2” with
the symphony.
Guest" Conductors

Michael Tilson Thomas — Tho-
mas started playing the piano at age
5 and is the third generation of a
family that has followed theatrical
and artistic careers. In 1968, he won
the Koussevitzky Prize at Tangle-

  

~ Lorin aazel

wood. A year later, he was
appointed assistant conductor of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra and
achieved national renown less than a
month later when he suddenly
replaced the orchestra’s ailing direc-
tor, William Steinberg, in the middle

of a concert at Lincoln Center. As a ‘

result, he directed 37 additional con-
certs of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra and was appointed its
associate conductor.

Thomas remained with the Bos-
ton Symphony until 1974. He regu-
larly conducts major orchestras in
the United States: Chicago, Boston,
Pittsburgh and San Francisco have

been on the list. He will lead the

Pittsburgh Symphony this season,
performing Mahler's “Symphony
No. 9.”

Christoph Eschenbach — Long
been regarded as one of the world’s
leading pianists, ‘Eschenbach won
several prizes in his teens, including
the Steinway Young Pianist Compe-
tition in Munich. He began his
active career with extensive tours in
I963 and first performed with an
American orchestra in 1967, soloing
with the Cleveland Orchestra Euro-
pean Festival Tour. Under the direc-
tion of George Szell, he performed
for the first time in America with the
Cleveland Symphony, playing
Mozart’s “Piano Concerto No. 19.”

In the last decade, he has come
into prominence as a conductor. In
1975, he made his first American
podium debut with the San Fran-
cisco Symphony. Since that time, he
has conducted major American
orchestras including those of Bos-
ton, Cleveland, Chicago, Pitts-
burgh, New York, Los Angeles,
Houston, Minnesota and Cincinatti.
Eschenbach will lead the Pittsburgh
Symphony in four concerts this sea-
son as well as conduct and perform
Mozart’s “Piano Concerto in C
minor.”

Rafael Frubeck de Burgos — De
Burgos was born in Spain, where he
was music director of the National
Orchestra in Madrid for IS years. A
frequent guest conductor of
Europe’s major orchestras, he has
appeared with the Berlin, Vienna
and Royal Philharmonic Orches-
tras, the London Symphony, the
Orchestra of the Conservatoire of
Paris and many others.

The Pitt News - September 9, 1985

De Burgos has toured extensively
in Japan with European orchestras
and has conducted all the major Jap-
anese ensembles. He will be the prin-
cipal guest conductor
National Symphony Orchestra in
Washington this season. De Burgos
will lead the Pittsburgh Symphony’s
performance of Dvorak’s “Sym-
phony No. 8,” Rimsky-Korsakov’s
“Scheherezade” and two pieces by
Spanish composer Manuel de Falla.

Zdenek Macal — Born in Brno,
Czechoslovakia, Macal gained
international attention by winning
two prestigious contests: the 1985
International Conductor’s Competi-
tion in Bescancon, France, and the
Dmitri Mitropoulos Competition in
New York. He made his American

debut in 1972 with the Chicago Sym- .
phony after numerous appearances -

with major European orchestras.

In 1973, Macal led the Pittsburgh
Symphony for the first time and has
returned here on numerous occa-
sions since. In the 1985-86 season,
Macal became music director of the
Sydney (Australia) Symphony
Orchestra, principal guest conduc-
tor of the Milwaukee Symphony
Orchestra and principal conductor
of the Grant Park Symphony. Pitts-
burgh is fortunate to have him here
this season for two concerts, when
he will conduct Beethoven’s “Piano
Concerto No. 5 (Emperor),” Proko-
fiev’s “Symphony No. 5" and
Mozart’s “Piano Concerto in B-ﬂat
Major.” '

Soccer team beats

Cal Llniv. for first win

' By Bill Deegan

For The Pitt News

The Panther booters remained
cool on a humid Friday night to
commence their 85-86 campaign
with a 2-0 victory over visiting Cal
State. The season opener was
accented by rough .play, but the
maturity of the squad showed as
they were able to regroup and
adhere to their game plan.

“It’s nice to open the
season with aiwin, but
there is a lot of hard
work ahead of us.”

— Joe Luxbacher

Early on, the Panthers were
caught up in Cal State’s
kick-and-run game, but after the
half, Pitt came back to the field
determined to play their own game
and to dominate the second half.

Pitt’s first goal came at 40:35 in
the first half. Scott Reimer, a
returning sophomore letter winner,
blasted a shot from 16 yards out that
left the Cal State goalie flat-footed.
Sparky Lucke recorded the assist.

The second goal was made at
12:27 in the second half. The goal
was a product of a well executed set
play evolving from a direct kick 19
yards from the left of the Cal State
net. Todd Smith toyed w_ith Cal
State defenders before passing the

Moss controlled the ball well and
proceeded to rocket a shot
pointblank past a helpless goalie.

Despite several golden
opportunities, the Panthers were
unable to score again. With the shots
on goal ratio at 22-5 in Pitt’s favor,
Cal State was fortunate to leave Pitt
Stadium with a 2-0 loss. '

Pitt’s defensive ability was again

reaffirmed for Big East opponents.‘

The Panther “back four,” consisting
of Dan Liberati and U20 Chibundu
in the middle, Brian ‘Casey and

‘Andrew Adelman on either side,

exhibited their usual style of solid
defense.

Pitt goaltender David Torrence
was left vitually uncontested the
entire game, recording two saves on
his way to his 14th career shutout.
Torrence, a senior, is trying to enter
the record books by surpassing the
old mark of 14 shutouts held by
Frank Bucci.

Coach Joe Luxbacher was
pleased with the Panther’s
performance. “It's nice to open the
season with a win," said Luxbacher,
“but there is’a lot of hard work
ahead of us. The team has not
reached its full potential. There are
still some areas of the game that
must be smoothed out."

The Panthers’ next game will be
Wednesday night at 7: 15 p.m. They
will host Mercyhurst College at Pitt
Stadium.

Lady spikers get off to fast start,

beat Michigan, win Kent State Classic 4

By Kelley Butt
For The Pitt News

What are the chances of the Pitt
Lady's Volleyball Team bringing
home another Big East title this sea-
son? According to Coach Shelton
Collier, Pitt is a strong favorite to
win the Big East Championship
again.‘ However, Collier and his
Lady Panthers are not taking the
lofty rating for granted.

“We’ve got to get out there and
win, and we have to improve to do
so. Being ranked 18th in the country

. is a definite motivator. We want not

onlyto win the Big East, we want to
go on to the NCAA. Our goal is to be
among the top 16, or even top eight
teams in the nation this year. We
need to win the Big East before we
can go on to the NCAA.”

If this past Saturday’s events were
any indication of the season to
come, watch out! The Lady Panth-
ers returned home from the Kent
State -Classic sporting a 4-0 record
and the tourney championship. Col-
lier believes,“This is a step inthe
right direction. We’re learning a lot

this season, and it will take us.

awhile to gel as a team, but I saw
signs that we will be very.competi-
tive this year.”

Led by senior Captain Judy
Young, with 167 assists, the Lady
Panthers were able to win three
matches in the round robin tourna-
ment. The University of Dayton was
the first to fall: 15-8 15-10 and 15-4

Pitt" soccer goalie David ‘Torrence is quietly approaching the school record for.

shutouts.

 

Kent State was next: 15-4, 15-10 and
15-7. Michigan proved to be a
tougher foe, going the full ﬁve
matches. Pitt won the first two
matches, with scores of 15-10 and
15-11. Michigan retaliated and
chalked up two wins, 17-15 and 15-
13. The Lady Panthers came up with
a 15-10 victory in the final match of
the series. -

In the championship game, Pitt
again had to face the troublesome
squad from Michigan. Michigan
won 15-9 in the first match only to
have the Lady Panthers - bounce
back with a 15-10 victory. Then, the
tide turned again with the Panthers
going down in defeat 11-15. After a

« quick pep talk, the Lady Panthers

marched onto the court, took con-
trol and handed Michigan a 15-4
loss.

During the final match of the
championship game, some doubts
surfaced in Collier’s mind. The
Panthers were behind 8-12 when the
things clicked and they come back to
win 15-13, capturing their first title
of the season. Coach Collier sta-
ted,>“We played a demanding fifth
match, and I was pleased with the
way things turned out."’

Offensively, the Panthers were
paced by juniors Sue Hoover and
Kris Wexell with 61 and 41 kills,
respectively. Pitt also -played three
first-year players. Denise Frawley
had 38 kills, freshman Nora
Mulvihill had 35 ‘kills and
soph e L' St

   
  
 

423%‘

kills. Freshman Dianne Zerbey was
used as serving specialist, racking up
11 aces.

By winning their opening
tournament bid of the 1985 season,
the Panthers assured their national
ranking for at least another week:

Coach Collier was pleased with the '

win and the maintenance of their
rank of 18th in the nation.

Pitt travels to the I1linois.State
University tournament next

weekend, there they will be facing ‘

teams of top 10 caliber, such as
Stanford (last year’s NCAA
runner-up) and nationally ranked

. Illinois State.

Coach Collier is looking ahead to

the tournament and is confident that A

the players are tough kids who are
used to winning and want to win.
“They showed a lot of maturity, and
the younger players excelled as well
at the Kent State matches. One of
our goals this season is, for the time
being, to hold onto our national
ranking. _

“I think we are fully capable of
doing so. We’re trying to perfect a

new offense involving a lot of ‘

deception and quick sets. We’re still
in the early stages, but once
mastered, Pitt will no longer be
playing traditional volleyball. This

will lend more excitement to the

game."

And that’s something
competition may not be expecting
from the Pitt Lady Panthers.

CHICAGO (UPI) — Cincin-
nati Reds player-manager Pete
Rose went into yesterday’s game

’ with the Chicago Cubs needing
only three hits to pass Ty Cobb
as Major League Baseball’s all-
time career leader in hits. Well,
he got two of them, tying Cobb
with 4,191 career hits.

Standing at the plate with a
count of three and two, Rose
lined a single directly over the
head of Cub second baseman
Ryne Sandberg. That hit came
off Cub - pitcher Reggie
Patterson. _ ' .

 
 

Rose catches Cobb  

In his first trip to the plate on
Sunday’, Rose drilled a single
into left-center to pull within one
hit of the legendary Cobb. Rose
tied the mark. in his l3,761st
career at—bat. Cobb had set the
standard in 11,429 trips tolthe
plate.

The_ historic single was
handled on one bounce by Cub
right fielder Keith Moreland,
who returned the ball to the_
infield. lt was then retrieved and

immediately relayed to the Reds’?

   

Rose stood on first base, clap-
ping his hands with excitement
and tipping his cap. In right field,
Moreland applauded.

The fans, many who appeared
late with the surprising news that
Rose would play, gave the 44-
year-old man a loud ovation.
They had been standing during
his entire session at bat.-

Rose had not been expected to
play in yesterday’s game, but a
last minute injury knocked
scheduled Cub starting pitcher
Steve Trout from g the lineup.

The 15th-ranked Bruins ended the
Cougars’ 25-game winning streak
after it appeared that BYU quarter-
back Robbie Bosco had engineered
another miracle comeback. Bosco
gave the seventh-ranked Cougars a

24-19 advantage when he scored on
a quarterback sneak with 2:54
remaining on the clock. On the ensu-
ing UCLA drive, quarterback Matt
Stevens hit Mike Sherrard with a

62-yard pass, and moments later, .

Green scored the game winner.

1983, for the Cougars and‘ their first
setback at home since September
1982.

Bruin place kicker John Lee
added four field goals, and safety
Craig Rutledge returned an inter-
ception 65 yards for the other UCLA
touchdown. Bosco completed 29 of
41 passes for 340 yards and two
touchdowns. It was his sixth consec-
utive 300-yard passing game.

Penn State, 20; Maryland, 18 —
Seventeenth-ranked Penn State
knocked off No. 9 Maryland 20-18
on Saturday for its 21st straight win
over the Terrapins. A touchdown
and 2-point conversion early in the
second half rallied Maryland to an
18-17 lead, but the Nittany Lions
went ahead for good two minutes
later on Massimo Manca’s 46-yard
field goal.

Penn State’s John Shaffer threw
for one touchdown, and safety
Michael Zordich returned an inter-
ception for another. The Terps saw

iley heads for Nebraska, now justsa bad memory

 

Danteley osidrd himself to b in a cls by
himself, but wound up as just a chapter in the lost

season of 1984.

File Photo/ The Pitt News

Pitt's 31-30 victory over Purdue
on Aug. 31 was the first step in eras-
ing the sour memories of the 3-7-1
season of a year ago. Now with the
announcement that former Pitt
safety Dante Wiley has enrolled at
Nebraska, another step has been
taken in wiping out the 1984 season.

Wiley came to Pitt out of
Jeannette High School, where he
was a Parade All-America defensive
back. He burst on to the scene dur-
ing the summer of 1984 with a pro-
clamation that he would be the start-
ing quarterback when Pitt opened

- its season against Brigham Young.

Well, it turned out that Wiley was
long on confidence and short on
heart. Pitt fans will better remember
Wiley for his punt returns, in which
he headed straight for the sidelines
time and again, and for his prowess
in the defensive backfield, where it
seemed opposing running backs ran
through his arm tackles like a tiptoe
through the tulips.

Wiley’s brief career at Pitt
included time at several different
positions. He spent time at quarter-
back, wide receiver, safety, and punt
returner before settling in deep
down on Pitt's depth chart as a cor-
nerback in the spring.

Wiley’s troubles at Pitt grew last
winter after several altercations with
a student in Lothrop Hall. He
wound up paying over $700 worth of

medical expenses in order to avoid
legal action against himself. The
icing on the cake came when it was
released that he was academically
ineligible during late August.

Now he is at Nebraska, a school
that recruited him out of high school
as a quarterback, and he may fit in
there as well as anybody. For the
time being, his absence fromthe Pitt
roster will not be missed. With the
emergence of Ducky Lewis and
Keith Tinsley at the corners, and Bill
Callahan and Troy Washington at
the safeties, Wiley may have been
just another behind on the bench.

I am sure Pitt fans would rather
watch Keith Tinsley take a kickoff
straight up the middle than watch
Wiley take a kick and head for the
sidelines.

Remember Nebraska quarter-
back Turner Gill? Well, three years
from now, Wiley may parallel Gill in
terms of accomplishment, but it will
be all the better that it happened at
Nebraska, and not at Pitt.

Wiley has to sit out a year before
he can play for the Huskers, but he
may be a year too late. The Huskers
struggled against Florida State _over
the weekend, losing their season
opener to the Seminoles, l7-l3. The
loss will more than likely drop the
Huskers in the polls . '

Speaking of the polls, has anyone
noticed that three of Pitt’s next four

opponents are ranked in the Top-20.
Ohio State has not played a game
but is ranked third. South Carolina,
ranked 18th, struggled to beat
Appalachian State, a real football
powerhouse, 20-l3. Then there is
Boston College, who, at l-l (losing
to Brigham Young and beating
Temple), occupies the No. 20 slot.

As for Temple, Coach Bruce
Arians’ dream of an undefeated sea-
son was quickly wiped out with the
Owl’s 28-25 loss to Boston College.
Arians, who earlier indicated that an
undefeated season is not out of the
question for the Owls, must now
concentrate on the rest of his sched-
ule, which includes Penn State,
Brigham Young, Syracuse, Pitt and
West Virginia. What bar was Arians
in when he laidclaim to the unde-
feated Temple season? Maybe he
and Wiley should get together.

Look for the polls to be a bit dif-
ferent this week. Ohio State will
probably drop due to the loss of
Keith Byars, and Nebraska will no
doubt go down, along with
Washington, Brigham Young,
Maryland, and Illinois, all of whom
lost this weekend.

Also, for the first time in a while,
look for Pitt to crack the top 20.
After the win on national television,
the Panthers are bound to get some
votes.
