Graduation scheduled for the Civic Arena

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor

. Spring graduation is being held at the
Civic Arena, not the Cathedral of Learning
Lawn. The minors can now cease.

"There was talk of doing it on campus,”
said Ron Gigliotti, assistant director of spe-
cial events and commencement director.
“But there was never any official statement
saying it would be held on campus.”-

Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor made. the
decision about two weeks ago that gradua-
tion would be held at the arena, according to

Gigliotti.

The cost and the lack of a viable rain plan
were the two main factors in the decision,
Gigliotti said.

“The expense of doing it on the lawn
would have been more than renting out the
Civic Arena,” Gigliotti said, “and if it were
to rain, there’s no place on campus big
enough to move it to.”

The ceremony will be held on April 30 for
graduates.

Gigliotti put to rest another rumor about
the restriction of guests. Since the ceremony
will be at the arena, there will be no restric-

tion on the number of guests, Gigliotti said.

“That’s one of the problems having
the ceremony on campus. We would have
to restrict the number of guests.” Gigliotti
said.

And there shouldn’t be 'a problem with a
change of date like in past years, according
to Gigliotti, when the ceremony was forced
to move to Mondays because of the
Pittsburgh Marathon being held on the ﬁrst
Sunday of May. The calendar falls -in favor
of a Sunday graduation this year.

“We should be all right until 1999,”
Gigliotti said.

Volunteers help
translate for Pitt
medical patients

By Erica Glasspool
Staff Writer

Analyst cites no real
reason to vote Democrat

Ines Schaffer, a 58-year-old retired school teacher,
not only fills her days and nights by taking classes at
Pitt but also by helping medical personnel communi-
cate with non-English speaking patients.

“Being a patient is hard enough, let alone the little
old lady from Oakland, to someone from across the
world who can’t communicate with their doctors,”
said Maria G. Scalise, an International Relations
Liaison.

Schaffer volunteers for the Volunteer Language
Bank at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
(UPMC), and speaks six different languages, including
English.

, The language bank is a listing of volunteers that
Scalise can pull from to help in translating and inter-
preting.

Even though Scalise tries to exhaust the volunteers
that also work in the hospital, she is trying to expand
the help from the university and community. _

Volunteers are used for everything from explaining
complicated transplant surgeries to making sure the
patient knows how to take the prescribed medication.

“I didn’t know if I could look at what the surgeon
was doing,” said Schaffer recalling her first job in
cataract surgery in the operating room.v“The patient
was under local anesthesia and I had to explain to the
patient what they were doing. But [the surgeons and
anesthesiologist] were so nice that it wasn’t bad. The

WASHINGTON The
Department of Agriculture
announced new_ long-term
changes to update the antiquated
meat and poultry inspection sys-
tem.

The proposed changes are
aimed at making meat and poul-
try safe from bacteria and other
contaminates.

The changes, which are esti-
mated to cost the meat industry
$700 million over the next three
years, involves requiring meat
processing plants to have a writ-
ten standardized operating sys-
tem for handling the carcasses.
They will be required to wash
the carcasses with an anti-bacter-
ial agent and refrigerate the meat
immediately after slaughter.

The plants will also have to
randomly test meat production
each day for salmonella, a bacte-
ria that is known to cause food-
bome illness..— Reuters

WASHINGTON — The Dairy
Coalition, which represents the
dairy industry, announced this
week that milk consumption in
the United States rose 0.8 per-
cent in 1994 in the face of dire
predictions of losses by anti-

Last year the government
approved recombinant bovine
somatotropin, a synthetic bovine
growth hormone, which would
boost the production of milk in
cows. Activists opposing the use
of the growth hormone predicted
that milk consumption would
drop by 25 percent because of
the changes.

Representatives for the milk
industry also point to Gallup
polls citing that consumers have
not changed their consumption
of dairy products in the face of
increased public awareness
about the growth hormone. -

Services at Pitt and a guest

MYTH OF THE MONTH:
“Rape is a women’s issue.”
There appears to be a
societal propensity to place
the responsibility of
rape/sexual assault, on
women. In a court case in
Miami, Fla., an alleged

fore, they should not be
surprised when a boy
attempts to take by force
what he thinks he deserves
and wants. It is only his
“hormones talking.”
Women and men are edu-
cated to believe that men
are not responsible for their
“hormones.” Women are.
The circulating myth that
rape is a women’s issue has
done a serious disservice to
victims. Victims are afraid
to come for-

rapist was
a c q u i t t e d
based on what
the victim had
been wearing
at the time of
the rape. A
female Pitt
student, upon
being ques-

 

ward because
they buy into
the myth and,
consequently,
blame them-
selves for
causing the
rape to occur:
“I must have

tioned by her female
friends afte_r she had dis-
closed that she had been
raped, was asked, “Why
did you go to that party?
You know what happens at
those parties. Why did you
drink so much?”

Women are constantly
bombarded with messages
about setting limits in rela-
tionships, saying “no,”
drinking in moderation,

trusting their instincts,‘

being aware, etc. They are
led to believe that “boys
will be boys” and, there-

been leading him on. He A

wouldn’t have done this,
otherwise.” And, if the vic-
tim does not blame him-
self/herself, the pervasive
fear is that somewhere in
the systemic process,
someone will — be it a
police officer, a rape coun-
selor, a jury, a parent, etc.
Consequently, many vic-
tims on campus live alone
with their secret and, some-
times for the remainder of
their lives, have difficulty

tionships, trust, identity, etc.

It is imperative that people
begin to view rape as a soci-
etal issue. Men and women
are responsible for the pre-
vention of sexual violence,
specifically date/acquain-
tance rape, as that is most
prevalent on the Pitt campus.
The following risk reduction
strategies are important for
both men and women to put
into practice in order to help
prevent sexual violence at
Pitt.

TALK
DIRECTLY:

It is necessary for individu-
als to establish personal sexu-
al limits and self—expecta-
tions. In every relationship,
these limits and self-expecta-
tions need to be communicat-
ed, respected and accepted by
the other person.
Communication about sexual
desires and limits needs to
occur as early as possible in
relationships. If communica-
tion is lacking or has not
been accepted, sex could
become rape. And, remem-
ber, “no” can be communicat-
ed nonverbally as well.

REGARD PERSONAL
BOUNDARIES AND FEEL-
INGS:

Unconditional regard for
another’s feelings and per-
sonal space is a necessary
dynamic in every relation-
ship. Another individual’s

OPEN AND

personal boundaries and feel— _

ings may conflict with your
own sexual desires and/or
expectations. However, it is
‘imperative that you accept
and regard the decision of
another individual, even if it
differs form what you want or
except. Sexual assault is the
result of not accepting the
decision of another person. It
is the act of violating another
person’s boundaries and dis-
regarding the feelings of
another human being.

BE RESPONSIBLE:

Alcohol and drugs play a
significant -role in acquain-
tance rape. Responsible deci-
sions are compromised while
under the influence of alcohol
or drugs. Intoxication inhibits
effective communication and
active listening. Responsible
drinking is an important
ingredient in the prevention
of sexual exploitation.

BE AWARE OF MYTHS:

Many individuals subscribe
to the abounding myths per-
taining to sex: men must
always initiate sex; sex and
masculinity are one and the
same; popularity among male
peers will increase with more
sexual exploits; men don’t
talk about their sexual limits
or desires; women don’t like
to initiate sex. Believing in
these myths will only create
misunderstandings and misin-
terpretations. Asking your
partner what she or he wants
may feel initially uncomfort-
able. However, it will allow
for the development of
healthier relationships and
more fulfilled individuals.

Language-

anesthesiologist taught me a
lot.”

Besides doing things like

surgeries, volunteers are needed

to escort patients to places like
the Falk Clinic for check-ups.
Volunteers are also encouraged
to just visit and talk to patients
in order to get their minds off
their problems and bring their
anxiety level down.

For the most part, volunteers
are needed on the spur of the
moment. A nurse usually calls
down to the bank and says that
they have a patient that only
speaks Italian. Scalise then goes
through the bank looking for an
able volunteer.

Volunteers are needed from a
half-hour or longer if the patient
is in the Intensive Care Unit. If
the patient is going to be in the
hospital for a couple of days the
volunteer will be notiﬁed ahead
of time.

“Sometimes it’s as simple as
knowing that they need a drink
of water,” said Scalise.

In one instance, Schaffer had

"to repeatedly tell a French— _

speaking women that in order
for her to be cured, she had to
take her medicationiall of the
time.

“I had to drum it into her so
she wouldn’t get sick. I remem-
ber her saying to me that I was
the only friend she had in
Pittsburgh. It feels very good
when you help someone out,”
said Schaffer. -

promise only to “bring up for a
vote” the proposals put forth in the
contract, said Smith. “The national
media has done a spectacular job of
not remembering that.”

Smith guaranteed the contract
will be fulﬁlled because all of the ,
items contained within it will be
brought up for a vote in Congress,
and he claimed this alone will be a
success for the Republicans.

“The fact that [the contract] will
be brought up for a fair hearing is a
victory,” he said.

But for any of their proposals to
become law, Smith said it is irnpor—
tant for Republicans to gain a
Democratic following.

“Republicans as a voting popula-
tion are still the minority party. We
can’t do anything without
Democratic support,” he said.

While Newt Gingrich was credit-
ed with being “one of the most
visionary people who has ever rep-
resented the wishes of the
Republican party,” Smith was criti-
cal of some of his party’s former
leaders. He said Ronald Reagan’s
lack of interest in the deficit and
George Bush’s breaking of cam-
paign promises is what contributed
to Bill Clinton’s election in 1992.

“One thing the American elec-
torate will not stand for is messing ’
around with their taxes,” said
Smith. He added that the electorate, '
and particularly students, should
become more involved in local
government campaigns, and that
they “must not let elected leaders ~
forget the promises they make.”

same.

“If the Democratic Party
does not care about poor peo-
ple and their lot then we
should cease to exist,”
Murphy said.

He suggested learning from
the Democratic Party’s history
of utilizing churches and pub-
lic schools as a forum for
increasing awareness of prob-
lems such as homelessness.
He attributed the inability to
do so in recent years because
parents assume that a private
school provides a better edu-
cation. 1

He cited that removing
more children from public
schools and placing them in
private ones adds to the segre-
gation problem in
Pennsylvania.

Murphy told stories of par-
ents who work jobs at mini-
mum wage to provide for their
families and in return pay in
excess of $100,000 in hospital
bills for emergency opera-
tions. In one story, when he
inquired as to why they did ,
not go on welfare to get more
inexpensive coverage, one
mother replied, “When my
daughter goes to college and
is sitting in her freshman ori-

APARTMENTS AILABS“ 

entation, I want her to be able
to say that her mother has a
job.”

In Murphy’s eyes the fault
does not lie with these parents
but with unresponsive
Democratic representatives
and senators not willing to
take a stand and back a
Democratic president on any-
thing. ,

He concluded the meeting
by calling on the young
Democrats of today to
increase awareness in their
fellow students and call the
university on recent disturbing
events such as the brutal
assault of David Orsbom, who
was attacked on the Towers’
steps. Murphy said he feels
that being able to walk from
class to class should not be a
matter of life or death.

If he had to construct the
perfect life for himself,
Murphy said that he would go
to a housing project some-
where in the country and put a
sign on his door that said, sim-
ply, “Knock if you need me”.

According to Murphy, peo-
ple are still knocking just as
hard as they did years ago, but
the difference is the
Democrats are not letting
them in.

Get rested

How well do you really know your current significant other?
Perhaps a more important question is, how involved are you?

The warning, though it has been sounded many times before,
has gone unheeded. AIDS is now the the leading killer of
Americans between the ages of 25 and 44 years old. According
to a report in The New York Times, AIDS is also the leading
cause of death in 70 of 169 American cities with a population of
100,000 people or more. '

How long will it take for America to wake up and realize that
we are living in a plague year? As of now, there is no cure, no
vaccine and very little hope of obtaining either in the near future.
The only real way to protect yourself against the disease is to
become aware of the ways in which‘it is’ transmitted and avoid
contracting the disease. '

AIDS is increasing in all segments of society, showing that

people are not taking appropriate precautions. While abstinence
from sex and avoiding intravenous drug use are the only ways to
be fairly certain of signiﬁcantly lowering your chances of con-
tracting this disease, anyone who has been sexually active or had

a blood transfusion since the onset of the epidemic in the early‘

1980s must acknowledge the risk of infection.

People should not only practice safe sex, but also have them-
selves and their partners tested before engaging in sexual rela-
tions. The Allegheny Health Department offers free testing and
can be reached at 578-8080, though no appointment is necessary.

Support recycling week

As Theodore Roosevelt once said, conservation involves
construction as well as just setting aside natural resources.
Therefore, it is important that people take a more active role
in saving America’s natural resources than just paying taxes
to support wildlife preserves and national parks.

One way to do this is to recycle. In order to promote this,
Pitt’s Student Environmental Action Coalition is organizing a
second recycling week in February. The week of Feb. 6-10
has been named the second recycle week. Students should
begin saving recyclables now in order to contribute next
week. Glass, paper, aluminum cans, corrugated cardboard and
paper will all be taken as part of recycling week.

Pitt students should not see this as a one—time event, how-
ever. Recycling bins in the residence halls should be used
properly as well throughout the year. It is important to sepa-
rate the recyclables and place them in their appropriate bins.
In addition, trash must be kept separate from the materials to
be recycled. If trash is mixed in with the recycling bins, the
material in the bins is considered contaminated and discard-
ed. ‘

In this manner, recycling will be turned into a daily reality
as opposed to an event. The issue is no longer one of political
correctness or ideology, but one of making the best use of the
resources available to the country. i

the sun’s shine, my thoughts
are of the helpless prehistoric
dinosaurs. My time-traveled
kinship to those times is
because of our present day
inability to do anything about
the weather. Much like the
dinosaurs, what can we truly do
about the weather?

I suppose one could just fold
up camp or close the cave and
relocate. However, the weather
can turn bad regardless of
where you live.

. We’re stuck! We can’t relo-
cate, and it’s a dismal affair to
stay here. We in the Northeast
huddle under meteorological
conditions which must resem-
ble the period right after the big
meteorite supposedly hit Earth
back during the Stone Age.

If you are not familiar with
the meteorite theory, it goes
something like this -
“Brontosaurus and the Boyz”
were merrily devouring giant
redwoods and gulping glacier
spring water when much to
their surprise, they were
knocked on the noggin by a
chunk from the galaxy. ‘Due to
the rock’s impact, the sky
turnedto dust. Any dinosaur
that survived the initial heaven-

ly punch choked to death from_ .

overpollution.
Their demise was total, a

wake attended only by para-

sites who slobbered‘ over
stegosaurus carcass, munching
the bodies down to the bones.
The remains fossilized as
today’s petroleum supply was
being created. This part of the
meteorite theory is known as
the parallel parasite theory.

It is important when dis-
cussing the meteorite dinosaur
theory to state the parallel para-
site theory. Parallel parasite
theorists believe that after the
ﬂying syringes were finished
with the dinosaurs, evolution
took over and the parasites
evolved to be present day tele-
marketers.

As difficult as it is to avoid

persistent solicitors, it’s harder
to go out and meet the winter
weather. To embark and forage
under winter’s foreboding skies
is disconcerting. Too many
question need to be answered
before acting on the simple
task of putting one’s foot out
the door. Is a torch needed to
light the dark created by the
absence of the sun’s rays?
Shall I throw on some extra
garb to hold my body’s heat?

I hate to keep dressing myself
with layer after layer of clothes
in order to keep warm. If I do
this, after I am finished dress-
ing, I’ll feel like a large bulky
human sandwich. My appetite
is more for warmer, brighter
days, when I would be in pic-
nic attire and not be scurrying
away from the Tyrannosaurus
imprints of winter.

Shouldn’t we be able to do
more about the weather other
than play multiple dress-up?
Maybe change the weather? As
I attempt to answer my winter
weather questions, my spirit
turns strangely cold.

What if there is a scientist
trying to rearrange molecules
well beyond the weather? Is the
fortitude that I must muster to
face our winter also needed to
confront a molecular DNA
experiment gone bad?

You know scientists. Once
they discover how to change
something in one area of study,
they immediately try to apply
their discovery to other unrelat-
ed fields. Typically at first,
with unpredictable results.

For example, I can see the
newspaper _ headline,
“ M o l e c u 1 a r
Biologist/Meteorologist Doctor
Danielle and Big Bad Giant
Dino Gone Bad!” Doctor
Danielle, of course being from
France,,would give an exasper-
ated explanation to the Press,
“ze molecules went ze boom
boom!”

What rights do the scientific

communities have to be tinker-

ing with the weather or the
DNA code? For the potential
benefits? Well, if it’s warm,

at yet another cloud-
covered sky suffocating .

weather all year round, what
would happen to the
Burlington Coat Factory? If
DNA research cures the com-
mon cold, wouldn’t Kleenex go
bankrupt?

Speaking of money, or lack
thereof, I would much rather
have Dr. “D” apply her synaps-

-es to “personal finance”

research. Perhaps to research
that discovers how I can make
my social life prosper by hav-
ing the molecules of my money
supply auto-regenerate on com-
mand. In slang terms this con-
cept is noted in the phrase.
“slip me a fin!” Expressed sci-
entifically, “graft me a 20!”

A quick second look out my
window and upward toward the
sky and I modify my personal
forecast from dismal and dark
to cool and crisp. Crisp much
like the smacking sound made
from lips about to be warmly
kissed by a hot dish. Today is a
day to consume crisp, spicy
soups, or a tangy chili, versus
having the day consume me.
(As an aside, it is difficult to

say if any “hot” culinary.‘

species exists at the William
Pitt Union food barn.)

I walk away from my win-
dow and I forget about the
times known thousands of
years ago. Instead, I embrace
the present conditions and all
that they hold, be it cloudy or
cold. Much like nature’s
clouds, I’ll puff and whirl
toward my horizon and natural-
ly adjust as the elements and
molecules present themselves
to me. Well, all right, what I
mean to say is I’ll occasionally
lose and regain my balance,
and I won’t be inebriated.

The weather isn’t that bad. If
nothing else, it has caused
some warm introspection and a
heartier forecast for today and
tomorrow. ,

As for the dinosaurs, let me
at ‘cm! How dumb could they
have been to be surprised by a
meteorite?

Columnlst tragedy come
D-‘=lYid to life in the  
Sallba depths of the

Fitzgerald
Field House. As the crowd
fills the arena, encompassing
the hardwood that lies as
centerstage, head coach
Ralph Willard and his cast
are ready to entertain. And
entertain they have.

Although many games
have been heartbreaking
losses, they have held a
quality of entertainment
unmatched of late, leaving
the audience caught in a
whirlwind of emotions. Six
games have been lost by
four points or less, and three
of those were lost by a mar-
gin of two.

So who do you point the
finger at? The head coach?
The players? Let’s take a
look at the latter for a
moment. The cast of players
Willard puts before us, game
in game out at center stage,
is an unruly bunch. They
scrap and fight, never letting
up. But when the proverbial
curtain closes and the stands
empty, heads shake from
side to side while reliving
the one play that justmight
have led them to the other
side of the record column.

Remember though, they
are still entertaining. It’s a

"show, and in the case of the

Panthers, it has taken the
form of a Shakespearean
tragedy.

The overweight and bald-
ing man, who once shut
down Larry Bird, points his
finger in dissatisfaction of
the event at hand. The audi-
ence takes the form of this
man. It singles out a charac-
ter or two, mainly those who
forget lines or drop basket-
balls. It witnesses the rise
and fall of a character and
the calamitous events that
occur with unhappy, endings.

Orlando, Orlando, why
must thou lose thy ball?
Hold to it with both hands.
Square thyself to the basket
and maintain thy balance.

The taunting and jeering
of the audience arises as the
final scene commences.

Eagles land first Big East win

  

Pitt News File Photo

Orlando Antigua burned the Eagles with 23 points in a los-
ing effort as the Panthers fell to 1-9 in Big East play.

Eagles’ first Big East victory
of season.

“The bottom line in this
game is you have to make
plays at the end of the game,”
head coach Ralph Willard said.
“We needed that one rebound.

That’s the basketball game
right there.”

qualify

for IC4As at Terrier Classic

By Diavail Smith
For The Pitt News

The Panthers’ men’s and
women's track teams came
out fighting as they posted

some of

t h e i r

b e s t

times of

the sea-
son at
1 t h e
e t ’ Boston

Terrier Classic last week-

end.

“Pound for pound, we
might be the best fighter in
the world,” coach Steve
Lewis said.

Time was the most impor-
tant thing to both

, teams, and it showed, with
several individuals qualify-
ingfor the IC4A’s in the
process.

The men showed up big
as the 4x800-meter relay

 

team, which includes Mark
Bufalini, Ed Adamson,
Scott Curry and Frank
Nesko, ran its best time of
the season with a time of
7:45.16 and a second-place
finish to qualify for the
IC4A’s.

Nesko, a fourth-year run-
ner, also demostrated his
individual skills by hitting
his best time of the season
in the mile (4111.59) to
impress Coach Steve
Lewis.

“Frank ran his best mile
ever,” Coach Lewis said of
Nesko’s qualifying time.

And third-year sprinter
Jay Jones lashed out of
the competition in the
200-meter dash with a
season-best of 22:10 sec-
onds.

And don’t forget about
the women, who also
showed that they’ve got
skills by posting some of

their best times.

Second-year runner
Angie Morton showed
off her skills in the 800-
meter run with her
best time of the season
(2:10.38) and a fourth-
place finish.

But Martin wasn’t fin-
ished. She also helped the
4x400—meter relay- team of
Tonya Mullins, Joetta
Purter and Najuma Fletcher
capture their best time of
the season (3:44.ll) _and a

third-place finish to quali-

fy. . '

“That was a work week,”
Mullins said of the Terrier
Classic.

They did do some work
last weekend, but Coach
Lewis believes that the
leadership is coming from
many different places.

“We have a great group of
leaders, from the seniors to

0Track, page 7

they improved to 7-10 overall.

“We did a poor job of mak-
ing decisions,” Willard said.

This was glaringly evident
after the half when the
Panthers committed nine
turnovers while the Eagles
only had three.

The Panthers, who held a
six-point lead at halftime, were
outscored 47-36 in the second
half. The bulge stretched as
high as seven when Pitt cashed
in on free throws from a tech-
nical foul, but then things fell
apart for the Panthers.

BC coach Jim O’Brien was
tagged with the technical for
arguing a foul that was called
when a shot by Panther center
Jaime Peterson was apparently
blocked.

Peterson made both free
throws and Andre Aldridge
made one of two technical free
throws to give Pitt a 41-34
edge.

After Pitt failed to score on
their subsequent possession,

BC counterered with a 16-4'

run which was broken when
Jaime Peterson scored inside to
pull the Panthers within three
at 50-47.

The BC lead swelled as high
as eight at 57-49 when Mike
Molinsky sank two free
throws.

Pitt answered with a 17-9 run
that was paced by two three-
pointers and a jump shot by
Orlando Antigua which knot-
ted the game at 66.

Antigua, who has been in a
recent shooting slump, broke
out of it in a big way as he
poured in 23, including five of
eight from three-point land.

But Antigua’s big game was
overshadowed by the play of

For The Pitt News

Junior Jason Lannie is
poised and ready to take
over the role of the No. l
all-arounder for the Pitt
men’s gymnastics team
this season, a role previ-
ously held by Genaro
Seveiino, who graduated
last year. He is used to
being in the spotlight after
concluding a stellar high
school career. He was a
two-time all-around state
champion, a two-time

member of the all-state team
and was also named an All-
American.

Lannie attended Liverpool
High School in Liverpool, N .Y.,
just 15 minutes from Syracuse
University. But for him, that
was just too close to home to
continue his gymnastics career
and education. Pitt had every-
thing he wanted —— it was far
enough away from home and
had a good engineering pro-
gram.

Lannie’s success carried over
into his freshman year. Then,
last year, the injury bug that was
being passed around the entire
team caught Lannie by the foot.
In the third match of the year he
broke and tore ligaments in his
ankle.

With his injury fully rehabili-
tated, Lannie is looking forward
to taking over this season, and
after the first two meets, this
appears to be the case. Two
weeks ago at the Navy
Invitational, he set career highs
in the all-around (53.5) and
rings (9.25).

“Right now I’m trying to stay
consistent, I’m trying to hit all
my sets,” said Lannie. “Since I
go later on in the order, if you
see a couple guys miss, you
know you have to hit.”

Lannie, who is also a co-cap-
tain along with senior John
Shapiro, likes the pressure of
going later. He feels it is easier
to concentrate and that leads to
better scores.

“We all have confidence in
ourselves, but we all have confi-
dence in each other,” said
Lannie. “Even if two guys miss,
it won’t matter because we still
know, ‘Hey, I’ve seen him hit
this in practice a hundred times,

' he’ll hit it now.’ It’s key that we

have conﬁdence in each other.

“I try to lead by example, by
doing by sets [in practice] and
lead with your voice. It’s a bal-
ance,” Lannie said.

There is also a balance in the
leadership styles between the
two captains.

“John’s always doing some-
thing to make people laugh, to
keep the team loose,” said
Lannie. “I keep the team more
structured. It’s an awkward bal-
ance, I think.”

Lannie has his goals set for
his future, both for this year and
beyond. After he graduates he
would love to coach at some
level. It depends on if he ﬁnds a
job as a civil or environmental
engineer.

“[Gymnastics] has been part
of my life since I was like eight
years old. I just want it to be
thereall the time,” said Lannie.

As far as this year goes,
Lannie hopes to go to Nationals

' with the team and also as an

individual. Right now he is
working on polishing off what
he has, working out little execu-
tion errors.

With those adjustments, his
scores should go up, causing
Nationals to become a reality.
And if things go the way they
did at,Navy, a team berth at
Nationals could also become a
reality.

the coaching staff,” Coach
Lewis said. “They’re into a
tradition of working hard.”

And speaking of working
hard, one of the hardest
working women on the
track team, Zenia Ayrton,
did some work by posting
her best time of the season
in the 200-meter dash with
a time of 24.67 seconds,

, qualifying with a third-

place finish.

If you talk about leader-
ship, team co-captain
Stacy Suggs also qualified

in the 55—meter hurdles by.

hitting a time of 7:93 sec-
onds.

With everyone hitting
their best times and work-
ing hard, Coach Lewis
believes that. the team is
simply that good.

The Pitt track teams will
again try to prove their
coach’s theory this week-
end at the Hardee’s
Invitational in West
Virginia.

side all night as he matched
Antigua with career-high 23.

Pitt was never able to stop
him as he continually rained
jumpers from all over the
court.

“You have to go out and
make him drive,” Willard said.
“We didn’t do a good job of
game focus.”

Pitt looked lackadaisical in
the second half as they just
simply ran out of gas. "

The rash of last—second
defeats has apparently taken

ably draining.”

“It comes down to we’re
asking some people to do what
they can’t do. I can’t get angry
because they’re giving every-
thing they have. This is the
toughest thing that I have ever
gone through in my life.”

It doesn’t get any easier
Saturday as Villanova comes

“They’re playing exception-
ally well right now,” he said.
“They’ve got a very good bas-
ketball team.”

5_5 points of leader has been cast to
Jaime Peterson and at times
Chris Gant. But where is the
other senior? Where is
Orlando?

He’s there, but he has
been cast in another role. He
plays the emotional leader.
His role is not one of the go-
to-man, nor is it to be part
of the curtain call.

“Emotion rarely, if ever,
wins games,” cries the
heavy, balding man. “Points
win games. Offensive
rebounds lead to second
chances which raise the pos-
sibilty of scoring more
points. Defensive rebounds
lessen the chance of the
opponent from gaining
points, thereby increasing
the chances of your team
winning.”

With his 6—foot—7 frame of
a player who should be a
main character for the
Panther team, Antigua needs
to become more physical —
banging the boards, getting
rebounds and drawing the
fouls.

Most importantly, he
needs points. Drive to the
hole, draw the foul, create
the play.

“But that isn’t his role,”

‘ recants a faithful follower.
