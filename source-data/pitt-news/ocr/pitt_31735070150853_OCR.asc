Oakland Career Center provides
  new opportunities for locals

Parthena Mosiadis-
Staff Wrz'ter

After years _of moving between dif-
ferent venues, the Oakland Career
Center has decided to start anew in
Central Oakland. '

A group of benefactors, employ-V

ers, tutors, neighbors and friends
convened at the Oakland Career
Center on Semple Street to witness
its grand-opening ceremony on
March 13.

The Career Center, operated by
the Oakland Planning and_Develop—

- ment Corporation and leased from

the city of Pittsburgh for a dollar a
year, opened in September of 2012.
The OPDC is a community-deveb
opment corporation that focuses

 

on neighborhood-planning efforts.
Earlier this year, OPDC released the
Oakland 2025 Master Plan, a collab-
orative effort to improve housing,
transportation, greenery and rela-
tionships between long and short-
term residents in Oakland.

The OPDC raised a little more
than $210,000 for renovation costs

‘ through partner ﬁmders in town,

corporate ﬁinders and private dona-
tions. Bryan Perry, assistant director

A forworkforce and strategy at OPDC, V

explained that the city has granted
a ﬁve—year renewable lease to the
center. Essentially, the cost of what
the center wouldhave paid in rent
far exceeds the cost of renovations.
The newly renovated Career
Center now houses two programs

focused.on career development:
School 2 Career andjob Links. Each
program helps local students and
adults, respectively, develop skills
that will increase their likelihood of
ﬁiture employment. ‘

Perry said that School 2 Career
is a youth leadership programthat
immerses students from Pittsburgh
public schools into mentored work
experiences. These students addi-
tionally attend the Oakland Career
Center for routine after-school tutor-
ing sessions. ,

Pennsylvania legislators approve liquor privatization in House

Brett Wilson
Staff Wrz'ter

A bill to privatize liquor sales in Pennsyl-
vania is one step closer to implementation.

The Pennsylvania House" of Rep resenta-
tives passed House Bill 790 on March 21 to
privatize liquor stores in the state of Penn-
sylvania. The bill, which has received strong
support from Republicans, passed through
a Republican-controlled House by a vote of

5.103 to 90 and will now-head to the Senate,

where Democrats hold a 27 to 23 majority.
The bill would phase out a number of the
613 state—run liquor stores and replace them
with private vendors, though some counties
could retain the former business format. But
if fewer than 100 state—owned stores remain
after the proliferation of privately-owned
stores as a result of the increased competi-
tion, the state government would move out

ties and Pitt for tutoring. School 2 Career cur-
rently claims to have a 100 percent graduation
rate and 99 percent college—attendance rate for
students who are members of theprogram.

Perry said the School 2 Career program did
not have a stable home prior to the establish-
ment of the Career Center on Semple Street. In
fact, three different locations housed School 2
Career in the past 10 years.

Karla Stallworth, program director of School
2 Career, said the program was last housed in
a small three-bedroom home on Carlow Uni-
versity’s property. The new location, she said,
was speciﬁcally designed with School 2 Career
in mind. She added that the new Career Center
is a far more conducive learning environment
than the locations where the programwas pre-
viously housed.

“[The Career Center] is like a mansion com-
pared to where we were,” she said.

The School 2 Career program beneﬁts ﬁ-om
the ]oAnn Fountain Community Room, a spe-
ciﬁc room in the Career Center that Stallworth
said provides ample space for the 40 students
enrolledinthe program. .

Dynae Shaw, a high school senior from the
Barack-Obama Academy of International Stud-
ies, has been inthe School 2 Career programfor
three years and said she loves how the location
was customized for student needs.

Shaw attends the Career Center two to three
times a week in order to complete homework,
attend tutoring sessions, learn workplace eti-

quette and undergo Microsoft Oﬂice training.

Stallworth said that many of the students

of the liquor— distribution business entirely..

The bill would also create 1,200 wine and
spirit licenses for businesses to purchase,
and it would allow the sale of wine in super-
markets. Currently, only restaurant sections
of supermarkets are permitted to sell wine.

Additionally, beer distributors, which are

only allowed to sell beverages by the case
under current law, will be permitted to sell
products irrsix-' and 12-packs.
Pennsylvania is one of 18 states in which
the government controls the distribution
of alcohol in some capacity. Under current
state law, wine and spirits stores are run
by the state, and malt beverages are sold
by thecase by licensed dealers. Other es-
tablishments can also sell malt beverages

Democrats argue that this privatization

had the opportunity to see the transformation
of the Career Center on Semple Street from
before and after renovations.

“Our students could see the buﬂdingbefore
itwas under construction — see the trash and
debris — and see how it is now. They see be-
cause of this program that they’re’ making an
impact by being part of an organization that is
concerned with the community around them,”
she said.

In addition to a newfound stability, the
School 2 Career program also "now beneﬁts
from access to the Job Links program. Perry
said that from a ﬁnancial standpoint, hous-
ing both programs in one location cuts down

'on overhead costs. But there is also a practical
advantage to the arrangement.

“Because both programs are career focused,
one with kids and one withjob seekers, there’s
some natural synergy between the programs,”
he said.

For example, Perry said shared space allows
for students to reap some of the beneﬁts ofjob
Links, such as CPR classes if a student wanted to
be certiﬁed for babysitting or lifeguarding jobs.

In additionto CPR classes that attractawide
range of people,]ob.Links also provides two oth-
er types of classes to job seekers: certiﬁed nurse
assistant courses and home health aid classes.
Perry said that althoughjob Links succeeded in
placing people in dozens of different careers, its

best niche is in health care placement.

“We’ve strategically placed folks to ﬁnd work
in aplace where there’s a lot of hiring,” he said.

Unlike in past years, when Job Links was
forced to borrow space from local churches or
nursing homes to hold these health care classes,
the new building includes a lab that allows for
the classes to be held on-site.

union. They also argue that privatizing li-

quor stores will raise prices, an issue that-

Republicans dispute.

Eric Shirk, deputy director of communi-
cations for Gov. Tom Corbett, said it’s more
likely that privatization would drive down
prices through competition.

“You know in big cities like Pittsburgh,
there will be competition between stores
over the prices of their alcohol,” Shirk said.
“This‘)will,_ as privatization of most things,
hopefully drive prices down.”

‘ Another point of contention between
Republicans and Democrats is whether the
privatization of liquor will end a lucrative
revenue stream for the state. Rep. Brendan
Boyle, D—Montgomery, said four states that
have recently privatized the liquor industry
have faced negative ‘consequences.

Iowa, West Virginia, Maine and Washing-
ton were the last four states to privatize their

liquor sales. According to reports by The
Washington Post, Iowa and West Virginia
each made less than $20 million up front in
sales of liquor licenses to private vendors..
Information regarding revenue ﬁgures since
privatization wasn’t readily available for
Maine and Washington.

» “Each of the four saw the same thing —
revenue projections following privatization
never met what was promised,” Boyle said.

But Corbett hopes that, through the
sale of private liquor and beer licenses, the
state will raise around $1 billion, which will
be used for a one-time monetary surge in

education funding to beneﬁt Pennsylvania

public scliools. ,

Shirk believes that the momentum of ,

the bill’s passage in the House and the “will
of the people” will drive the Senate to pass
the bill, stating that “around 70 percent of
people in Pennsylvania believe that liquor-
stores should be privatized.” I

While Perry said classes cost those enrolled
“an appropriate amount,”Job Links also offers
services that are free to the public. Such services

include resumé development, mock interview .

training and online job searching.
As a result of the renovations, future em-

ployees now also have access to 14 computers V

for online job searches or to send cover letters
and resumés viaemail. Perry said these services

‘are particularly useful for those who don’t have
v a computer or a srnartphone in their homes.

He also said thatjob Links focuses programs
toward those without a college education.

“They may ‘have had a bad high school ex-
perience or need a GED, but they are having

, trouble ﬁnding the right entry-level niche,” he B

said. . '
While students looking for ﬁ1ll—time employ-
ment after graduation are welcome to stop by
the center, Perry said that Pitt students would
be equally well served utilizing Pitt’s Career
Development services —which offer assistance
to students applying for internships, gradu-
ate school orﬁ1ll—time careers ‘-- because they

are geared toward those receiving a college

education. ' ’ ‘- -

MCKINLEY  

parents’ reaction to my “coming
out” was largely anti—climactic

— certainly nothing that would

ever inspire a teary episode of
“Glee.”

This is not to discredit the
incredible pain so many of our
gaybrothers and sisters endure
in a world that still just wants
everyone to condescendingly
tolerate us; the 40 percent of
homeless teens who are gay is
just_one example of how growing
up gay can be disproportionately
difficult and wildly painful.

But not all of us have been
victims because of our sexual-
ity. I, for one, can fortunately
say that I have normally lived
and enjoyed my life regardless
of my sexuality.

Yet, as I get older and begin to
fall in what I perceive to be love,
I have realized that my protected
life in small—town Danville, or
in the friendly, socially liberal
confines of our Oakland cam-
pus, will not last forever. And
come April 28, I will be thrust
into a larger, national context
that deems me lesser.

In Pennsylvania, my boss can
legally ﬁre me because I am gay.
If I am attacked because I amlgay
— which, given the concerning
number of hate groups in the
Pittsburgh area, is not entirely
unlikely — the crime will not

be classified as a hate crime
because Pennsylvania, like 18
otherstates, does not catego-
rize assault against gays as a

‘ hate crime, as it would attacks

on someone’s other immutable
characteristics, such as race or
ethnicity.

The Supreme Court cases be-
fore us today represent a giant
leap in expanding civil rights to
the gay community, yet it is a
small step in the evolution of
human rights to all. Either way,
marriage equality represents

forward movement in our al- ’

legedly secular society. p

As a Catholic, I long ago ac-
cepted that I will never walk
down the aisle of St. Paul’s. I am
not asking to be married in my
church. And I am not asking to
be married in yourchurch.

I am demanding that I be mar-

. ried before the law. Perhaps your

God can determine the supposed
sanctity of one love over anoth-
er, but no court and no man can

determine the legitimacy of my

love for someone else.

' I deserve the same legal rights
that my brothers and their wives
will receive. Rights including
federal tax exemptions and any
of the other 1,100 legal beneﬁts

granted to heterosexual married .

couples. And as long as law de-
ﬁnestheir relationships as mar-
riage, then I want my relation-
ship to be called that, too. Not
a “civil union,” nor “domestic
partnership,” nor anything else

separate from the legal institu-
tion of marriage.

Growing up, we assume that
gay people came into existence
around the same time as anti-
war movements and Wood-
stock, but homosexuality has a
far older credibility than some
passing fad or modern phenome-
non. Being gay in America didn’t
start with Ellen DeGeneres or at
Stonewall.

In fact, the word “lesbian”
can be traced back to the 6th
Century B.C., when Sappho, a
female poet, declared her love
for other women on the Greek
island of Lesbos. More recently,
Jane Addams became the first
American woman to win the No-
bel Peace Prize in 1936. What
your textbooks don’t mention is
that she openly lived in love with
other women, and she wasn’t the
only homosexual of the Progres-
sive era. I I

Gay people do not exist in his-
tory books because historians
have glossed over or ignored
their sexuality. But they did ex-
ist. , '

Now is our moment to rec-
ognize those unwritten pages.
Now is our moment to advance
this great American experiment
one chapter further. And now is
our moment to once again learn
that a nation that reserves cer-
tain rights for some is inherently
unequal for all. I

LETTER To THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to Matt Schafl"s column in Tuesday’s Pitt News, which took a
pessimistic and decidedly arrogant approach to the OCC program. I would like to preface
my arguments by saying that I have not completed the OCC.

The OCC never says, “Do this or you are not awhole student.” It is a way for the University
to recognize students for being involved. Dr. Humphrey cares about her students, so she
put a program in place to recognize students for even the small things they contribute to
the University. You can print out a resume, whether you complete the OCC or not, which
lists the activities outside of the classroom that you have done.

Students may have done these activities regardless, but they are being recognized for
doing so. I sat in on a parent event about the OCC during orientation, and an admissions

counselor from a graduate program stood up during the Q—and—A session and applauded
Humphrey’s efforts because he recognized that this program does something unique by
providing solid documentation of activities that he looks for students to be involved with.

Thus, the OCC makes Pitt students more competitive. Other schools in the country are
already emulating the OCC program, so other schools have seen the beneﬁts of having a
program like this.

I would put my money on school administrators from reputable institutions knowing
what is best for their university before the pretentious Mr. Schaff. V

Sincerely,
Adam Gaus

Pitt Ballet Club presents a Va-
riety Showcase featuring “Alice
in Wonderland”

April 6

Bellefield Auditorium, 1
and 5 p.m.

Admission: Free, -but donations
will be accepted

p.m.

The Queen of Hearts parades across the
stage in her pointe shoes, twirling and
chasseing with comedic pompousness. The
King of Hearts looks lovingly on his prima
ballerina, clapping daintily to comply with
her need for attention. As the Queen sur-
veys the crowd for her next victim, thejack
of Clubs and Jack of Spades glance away
from her stare, which “invites” them for a
dance. She has her way with them, though,
stumbling through a partner dance and

fuming at their —— really her:— inadequa- »

cies. The scene ends with the grandiose
ﬁnale: Her arm swipes across her neck in
triumph, declaring, “Off with his head!”
On Saturday, April 6, at 1 p.m. and 5
p.m., the Pitt Ballet Club will present its
Spring Showcase featuring “Alice in Won-
derland.” The ﬁrst half of the show is des-

_ ignated as the club’s annual Variety Show-
case, a collection of dances from several ‘

dance genres. The second half, however,
will be a condensed production of “Alice
in Wonderland,” a completely student-
run and student-choreographed ballet
designed by club members.

IMPULSE
Ballet club takes quirky fantasy to stage

The ballet club will perform “Alice in
Wonderland” for its spring show. Zach
Schaffer | Senior Staff Photographer

The Pitt Ballet Club is perhaps best

known forits annual production of “The A

Nutcracker,” which it puts on toward the
end of each fall semester. Senior Devon
Antonetti, co—president of Pitt~Ballet Club

S and theyunofﬁcial creative director of the

show, said “The Nutcracker” is a welcomed

tradition, as it evokes feelings of Christ-
mastime and gives the audience what it
wants: a story. _ - -

“I think an audience likes a story,” she
said. “We Wanted to incorporate that feel-
ing into the spring [show].”

The past several years have seemingly
marked a heightened interest in Alice and
the “wonderful” world into which she fell.
While many remember watching with ado-
ration the slightly creepy, yet lovably inno-
cent, Disney ﬁlm, Tim Burton transformed
the story in 2010 into something dark-
er — and psychedelically bizarre. After
three years of simmering on the idea and
researching other dance companies’ ver-
sions of the show, Pitt Ballet Club decided
it would release its own creative take —— a
sort of comedy or parody.

“We ﬁnally have the numbers to be able
to pull off a production that large,” said se-
nior Angela DeVito, the other:co—president
of Pitt Ballet Club, who handles the logistics
of the production. Since the current co-
presidents’ freshman year, the club has
grown from 20 to more than 85 members.

Antonetti added that the club mem-
bers “also [have] the personalities. ‘Alice
in Wonderland’ [is a] crazy story. [It] has
some really out—there characters and some
really crazy ideas. I think you need certain
people to be able to pull that off in a funny
way and to make it really successful, [and]
we’re really conﬁdent in our members this
year, enough to throw this at them.” A

TELEVISION REVIEW
“House of  
Cards” has i

Spacey up sleeve

Kenny Ong
Visual Editor

“House of Cards”

Developed by: Beau Willimon
Starring: Michael Kelly, Kate l\/lara,
Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright
Grade: A+

The protagonist of “House of Cards” is more
than an anti-hero — he’s an evil mastermind.
And like all evil masterminds, Congressman
Frank Underwood has a secret plan — so secret,
not even you, the viewer, can know it.

“House of Cards” is a dramatic political
thriller that Netflix has adapted from a BBC
showbased onanovel writtenby Michael Dobbs,

a former politician in the U.K. The Netﬂix ver- .

sion follows Democratic Congressman Frank
Underwood (Kevin Spacey) as he enacts long-
term vengeance on the politicians who denied
him the office of secretary of state. The show
doesn’t tell you how or what that vengeance
involves, which might seemlike playing hardto
get so you come back for more. But each episode
carries its own share of suspense, twists and
reveals, making every watchworthwhile without
the ultimate resolution. Also, Spacey’s perfor-
mance as the ruthless, imposing, manipulative,
lying and somehow still likable Frank carries
not only the rest of the cast, but the show itself.

- Not that the rest of the cast and show are bland

—— they’re actually pretty memorable. Frank is
just unforgettable.

Episode one of “House of Cards” starts with
Frank crouching over a whining dog that’s been

‘hit by a car, compassionately shush-ing and pet-

ting away its suffering. Then, he looks into the
camera and says, “I have no patience for useless
things,” in a slow, southern gentleman’s drawl.
Frank then snaps the dog’s neck, quieting its
pain. It’s a powerﬁil openingthat lays the founda-
tion of Franks character and sets the tone of the
showinless thanaminute. Other shows dedicate
entire episodes to the same goals.

Frank’s a man who can dirty his hands witl1-
out dirtying his conscience. He’ll offer a hand
while hiding the knife that will ﬁnish the job.
At one point, Frank comforts amother after her
child’s death solely as political leverage, and it
works in Frank’s favor. He’s a politician out for his
thousand-year reign. Frank’s actions and inﬂu-
ences complete avery dark, depraved picture of
Washington’s shiningwhite palaces — buildings
with a single coat offairness above mountains of

rotting corpses and wriggling maggots.

WPTS V

Strong female artists should  
take back music industry

Sammy Wagner
WPTS C07zm'butor

Our popular soundscape has been waging an
insidious war against the image of women.
We’ve been turned into mindless, gyrating
automatons, lewdly virginal teenagers and
stripped-down objects. And I’m not going to
take it anymore. -

Women have been playing nice with patriar-
chy fortoo long — it’s time to introduce a little
common—sense, feminist anarchy. Pop culture

is ours, and we have the ability to shape it to "

our Will. If we identify, complain about and set"
ourselves against misogyny in the culture sur-
rounding the music industry, popular opinion
can change. ~-

First, become everything popular music has
told you not to be. Be a loser, be crazy, be an
outsider, be unknown. I’m tired of infantilized
pop stars reinforcing the same tired gender
roles and calling it romance, and I’m even more
tired of these mewling women trading their
sexuality for success and setting the standard
for female musicians everywhere.

The culture around the music industry
allows women to be either the whore or the
Madonna. Taylor Swift, the most notable Ma-
donna in popular culture, has apure, innocent

image and an audience of predominantly young 4

girls to whom she sends a particular message,
whethershe intends to or not. Her lyrics tell
these girls that they must think about them-
selves only in relation to boys. In the world
Swift has created, girls passively wait for true
‘ love, enter into relationships that they know
are bad for them and view their virginity as the
only thing they can give to a boy. _
On the other side of the spectrum is the
whore. Ke$ha is a speciﬁc ‘example among
female musicians who rely on overt sexuality.
Her persona is built on the “party gir ” image:
all sex and alcohol. But this doesn’t mean that
she is at fault or an actual whore in any way — it
just means she has no other option if she wants
success. Her fans do not understand this and
view it as the norm. It’s the start of a dangerous
line of thought that ends with girls thinking
they have no worth beyond their bodies and

V

no means of expression except scandal.
Women are made of more than their sexual-
ity — or lack thereof. Female artists deserve
to be as complex as their male counterparts.
Give me angry Riot Grrrls — the underground
feminist punk rock movement —— like the mem-

‘ bers of punk band Bikini Kill, who refused to
be taken lightly and infused their music with

feminism. Give me Pussy Riot, who never shies
away from its political beliefs, using pink ski
masks when performing so the focus is on the
music. Give me Janelle Monae in menswear,
dancing to display her’ skill and not to turn
men on. These are the women who break the
rules — as they should ——— and do it with style,
becoming more than their image.

Since when has a woman’s ability to shred
a guitar become dependent on the poutiness
of her lips? Why should her weight dictate her
success? Men are attractive because they are in
a band; women are in a band because they are
attractive. We need to cut bff female musicians’

reliance on sexuality until it can be stripped of A

its dependence on the male gaze.
And by becoming independent from an
industry that bases its aesthetics on the desires

. of straight men, female artists can ﬁnally own

their images and sexualities. After that, after
the war has been won, then women will be
free to do and be whatever they want outside
the conﬁnes of the Madonna—whore complex.

We have the power to draw the line. Help
femaleartists realize they do not need to work
within patriarchy. Ask why those who work in
the music industry depend so heavily on an im-

age, particularly one that caters toward men. .

When Tyler, the Creator raps, “Beat your b*tch
in her mouth just for talkin’ shit,” give him hell
forreinforcing sexist stereotypes while prop-
ping up destructive views of masculinity. The
next time a journalist evaluates female artists
purely on their images, shame the editor for
simplifying living, breathing human beings
into pairs of lips, breasts and legs. Call your
local radio station out for onlylplaying music

made by overtly sexualized and submissive

teenyboppers instead of kicl<—ass, independent

SPRING

Director Harmony Korine doesn’t generally

‘..-work with celebrities, but in this case, he ral-

lies together two former Disney stars, Vanessa
Hudgens (Candy) and Selena Gomez (the aptly-
named Faith); ABC Family actress Ashley Ben-
son (Brit); and his wife, Rachel Korine (Cotty) to
ﬁll his movie’s lead roles. Why exactly the three
«former women signed on is unclear. An act of
deﬁance? Do Gomez and Bensonwant to show
that they can act beyond the average good—girl
roles that they play on their respective television
shows? Perhaps the risk will pay off in the long
run. Regardless, it works for Harmony Korine.
“Spring Breakers” follows the story of four

bored college—age women who desire noth-
ing more than to cutloose and experience life
beyond the hometown they apparently rarely
leave. But they need money to get to St. Pe-
tersburg, F1a., so three of them hold up a local
restaurant with little water pistols and hammers
to come up with enough cash. Meanwhile, the
aptly-named Faith is at church, where her buff
pastoris shouting that he’s ‘jacked up onjesus.”
They make it to their destination, but after
afew days of drinking and using drugs, apolice
crackdown ends with the fourwomen tossed in
jail. “This wasn’t supposed to happen,” Faith
sadly whispers. Throughout, Faith maintains
this romanticized and profound concept of
Spring Break as a time to explore who you are
and forge an identity. But shestill serves avalu—
able role in the ﬁlm as a character who has some

morals and is shocked when things go too far.

A pseudo—rapper gangster by the name of
Alien (James Franco) is there to bail the girls out
and take them back to his crib to show off his ex-
tensive collections of shorts and machine guns
—— with “Scarface” playing on repeat. “Look at
my sheeyit!” he shouts as he bounces around
his bedroom.

If there’s anything this ﬁlm has taught us
about the talented Franco (who stars in the
family-ﬁiendly “Oz, the Great and Powerﬁil,”
also currently out in theaters), it’s that he’ll sign
on to anyﬁlm because he just loves working. The
ﬁrst time Franco appears on screen, you almost
can’t tell it’s him. Sporting cornrows and grillz
while rapping to a gyrating phalanx of intoxi-
cated spring breakers, he comes off as similar
to Britney Spears’ ex—husband, Kevin Federline.

Franco charmels Spears later in perhaps the
most indelible moment of the ﬁlm when Alien
plays a renditionof Spears’ “Everytime” on a

' grand piano while three of the girls dance along
like ballerinas in theirpink balaclavas and with
their guns.

The music in “Spring Breakers” meshes
perfectly with the dreamlike state and sudden
bursts of wildness the ﬁlm utilizes. Skrillex
teamed up -with ﬁlm composer Cliff Martinez
to score the ﬁlm. And let’s cross ourﬁngers that
Skrillex gets some accolades for the original
songthat Franco creepily sings as Cotty realizes
she’s not having ﬁm anymore after a gangster
shoots her inthe arm. “Four little chickies came
down to da beach,” he quietly sings while play-

ing the piano. “Four little chickies got out of my ‘

reach. One little chickie got shotinthe arm. That
little chickie went back to the farm.”

' Critics describe Harmony Korine as being
an eclectic director, someone who goes against
the grain. His ﬁlms aren’t for theaverage viewer,
and sometimes they don’t even make it to the big
screen. His 1995 “Kids” (which he wrote, but did
not direct) provided averyraw look into sexu-
ally active teenagers in New York City, including
the issue of AIDS. Several messages could be
pulled from that ﬁlm. But “Spring Breakers” is
a sharp departure from inost of his past work,
andeit’s hard to ﬁnd a clear message, let alone
an insightful one.

There are two fundamentally different ways
to leave feeling about this ﬁlm. One is that what
you just witnessed is a partythat puts Keith
Richards’ past behavior to shame. Theother is
a horriﬁc feeling in your gut that you spent 93

minutes laughing hysterically at sexually objec_- .
. tiﬁed women toting guns alongside a gangster

while searching for their true identities and the
American Dream —— but not quite knowing what
all of that means. .
But that’s what Harmony Korine wants. He
wants viewers to immediately dismiss his ﬁlm

as raunchy and in poor taste and then to think :

about what is really there underneath the neon
clothes and piles of cocaine. I

er, believes there’s a tangible excitement
surrounding the creative process of the
production, especially “ﬁguring out how
we want to portray those really quirky
characters.”

“I think that it is the fact that it’s a kind
of non-traditional ballet,” McPherson said.
“It’s newer [and] doesn’t have the history
associated with other ballets like ‘Sleeping
Beauty,’ ‘Cinderella.’ People know less about
how the ballet normally goes, which gives
us more freedom to do what we want to
do because there’s less expectation about
what should be done.’

Because they “didn’t have anything to

“It’s easy to choreograph ‘The Nutcrack-
er,’ because it has been done so many times
before. But for the Poppies scene [in ‘Alice

them to think of,” she said.

Due to a very limited budget, Pitt Ballet
Club also had to get creative with its cos-
tume designs and sets, relying more heavily
on the choreography and dance movements
to create the Visual effects desired from
the story. For instance, during the scene in
which Alice falls into the rabbit hole, the
dancers themselves serve as the hole in an
impressionistic way, dressed fully in black.

Pitt rallies

past Penn

State thanks to another

offensive explosion

Nate Barnes
Senior Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

The Pitt baseball team traveled
to Penn State Wednesday and
picked up a 10-8 victory in a
battle of offensive might between
the Panthers and the Nittany Li-
ons at Medlar Field in State Col-
lege, Pa.

Hitters in the middle of the
lineup paced the Pitt offense,
with sophomore Eric, Hess, ju-
nior Casey Roche and redshirt
junior Steven Shelinsky Jr.‘ each
recording two hits.

Pitt (16-6) needed every single
one of its 10 runs to defeat Penn
State (5-15) after the Panthers
trailed 5-0 at the end of the first
inning. Penn State chased Pitt
starter Luke Novoselwith just

-— one out in the opening frame, and

he ended his day responsible for
four of Penn State’s five runs in
the inning.

“That was a solid win for us,”
head coachjoejordano said in a
press release. “Obviously, it was a
cold day, and then we fell behind

5-0 in the first inning. But I re-
ally liked the way that we battled
hard, had some quality at-bats
and fought back.”

Pitt chipped away at the deﬁ-
cit in the ensuing innings, scor-
ing one run each in the second
and third innings. After Penn
State scored a run in the fourth,
Pitt responded with five runs in
the top of the sixth to take its ﬁrst
lead of the game at 7-6.

Two Nittany Lions runs in
the bottom portion of the sixth
inning, however, put the hosts
back on top, 8-7, headed into
the ﬁnal third of the contest. But
from there, redshirt junior relief
pitcher _].R. Leonardi (2-2) shut
Penn State out the rest of the way
to pick up his second win of the
season and allow Pitt to complete
the comeback.

_ Pitt tied the contest in the sev-
enth inning when junior Stephen

by freshman Bennette Hill, and
the Panthers retook the lead by

What will it take for the U.S.
men’s soccer team to be inter-

 nationally competitive?

Tuesday night’s 0-0 draw be-
tween the American and Mexi-
can national teams was seen as
a victory for the Americans, but
the scoreboard does not show
just how dominant the Mexicans

’ really were.

This question has plagued
soccer analysts, coaches, players
and fans for the past 30 years,
since many predicted the Ameri-
can soccer program would break
through in the 1990s.

Some said it would take a
World Cup hosted in the U.S.,
but that didn’t work. The 1994
World Cup, held in nine cities

cord. '

The Americans lost that year
to eventual tournament champi-

' on and traditional soccer power

Brazil, 1-0. Even -though soccer
grew in popularity after the 1994
World Cup, almost 20 years later
we can say that the competition

GABLER

Stewart, argues that NCAA regu-
lations on college soccer limit
Americans who choose to play
the sport in college.

“I see logistical problems in
the United States, and [NCAA
limitations on practice time in
college soccer] make it diffi-
cult,” Stewart said in an ESPN.
com article. “It all goes back to
repetitions —— hours and hours
and hours. Kids

in Tuesday’s match — Mexico.
Mexicans, and Hispanic peo-
ple in general, are the largest
minority in the U.S., and their
number will continue to grow.
It was clear that the Mexi-
cans boast the better squad after
watching Tuesday’s match. So
how does the U.S. get to the level
of our southern counterparts?
The answer is simple: recruit
Mexican—Am,erican players.
Currently, the U.S. battles
with Mexico to get American
citizens who

“It starts with being a cultur-

worth said in the same article.
“The key period of development
for a young player is at an early

_ age, when their acquisition of
technical skills is so important.”

Culture may be something
that can be changed, and to see’

' how it_ will be changed, look at

the team that wore the black kit

with the U.S.

and want to ‘

stars and stripes.

Someday the red, white and

like Hernandez and dos Santos
alongside Dempsey and Dono-

just maybe, the Americans will

SEPICH

of the more pessimistic Panthers
supporters: Put your worries about
the football and basketball teams

to the side for a little bit, and focus-
your Pitt fandom on some of the ,

University’s other sports.
Give the baseball team your at-
tention. -’ .
The Panthers are on the verge
of breaking into the top 25 of the

national rankings, and rightfully so »

after pulling off road sweeps of tra-

. ditional powerhousewichita State
and defending Big East champion‘ 

St.John’s already this season._
Head coach Joe _]ordano’s club
earned its fourth consecutive vic-

tory on Wednesday afternoon, .

beating Penn State 10-8 to follow
the three impressive triumphs
over St. John’s last weekend. All
four wins came on the road, and
Pitt pounded out at least 10 runs
in all four games. — 
With an offense consistently
posting big numbers, the team
plays an exciting brand of baseball

' and could earn a berth in the NCAA
tournament if it keeps performing A

at this level. _ e .

A day at Pitt’s beautiful new
Petersen Sports Complex on up-
per campus to watch the baseball

team play —— the Panthers welcome a
Tewsenfqrthreegamssthisweeks 
eTfidi:l5“efo‘ré hosting“1i ‘more games 7

throughout April -1- might be the

‘perfect cure for any downtrodden
Pitt football and basketball fans.

Give the softball team a chance.

Head coach Holly,Aprile’s squad

' also earneda series victory against , _
St. John’s last weekend, beginning
, the Big East season with a 2-1 mark.

Pitt softball also plays its home

.-games in_ the Petersen Sports Com-

plex, and with two star sophomore

. pitchers in Savannah King and Al—_

exa Larkin to go along with a large
and talented freshman class, the
team has avery bright future ahead
of it.

But that doesn’t mean the Pan-
thers don’t havehigh hopesfor this
season, as well.

Pitt hosts South Florida, Penn
§tate, Notr¢Dam.¢.andPrwzidencec
in the coming weeks, and those
matchups could determine whether
the Panthers earn any berths to
postseasontournaments.

_ _, And be sure, the ﬁery Coach
Aprile won’t accept mediocrity
fromgher team.

Give the gymnastics team your
support.

The Panthers earned their first
invitation to the NCAA Regionals
since 2007 earlier this week, and
head coach Debbie Yohman’s group
wants to cap "a great season with a
quality performance at the _six—team
meet on April 6_ in Gainesville, Fla.

If Pitt can ﬁnish in the top two of l

its region, which includes Florida,
Minnesota, Auburn, Maryland and
Bridgeport,_§‘;§ihe gymnastics team
will be headed to the NCAA champi-

, Honsvhip  Los:An_’geles later in April.

‘ C The Baseb51i,l‘§6ﬁba1I and gym-
nastics  all ﬁnding success
rightnow,  stop there as a.
Pitt sports fan.

Check up on the women’s tennis
team to see how it’s doing. Follow

play for the

,‘bv

the swimming and diving team as v

it competes at nationals. And don’t
forget to keep up with the progress

of the track team as it begins a sum—":.

mer ﬁill of competition.

With the football and basketball
teams constantly letting devoted
Pitt fans down, it only makes sense
to turnto some other squads of Pan-

_ thers competing at a very high level.
The athletes of these less—ap—
preciated sports work just as hard
as the football and basketball play-
ers do. a ' , .
And in many cases, they work
even harder.
So make yourself a more well-

rounded Pitt fan. Support all of the ’

Panthers. I , ._
