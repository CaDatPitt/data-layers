by James B. Acher, chairman of
the Board of Trustees of Indiana
State College, after an 18-month
search for a successor to the re-
tiring president.

According to Acher, “Dr. Rank-
in’s wide range of administrative
and academic experiences and
his broad perspective of the lib-
eral arts and general purpose col-
leges especially qualify him for
the ISC presidency.”

Indiana State’s on—campus en-

pected to reach the 13,000 mark

Dr. Rankin came to the Uni-

Chancellor Litchﬁeld and Asso-
ciate Professor of Political Sci-
ence in 1956. He became Assis-
tant Chancellor for General Af-

fairs in 1958 and added Student
Affairs to his title in 1961. In an
informal change last summer he
received his present title of vice-
chancellor,

“Mrs. Rankin and I will miss
particularly Pitt students who
have been most understanding
and constructive members of the
University community,” Dr.
Rankin commented. He explain-
ed that “the rare privilege of
having worked so closely with
Chancellor Litchﬁeld, who is, I
believe, America's most creative
educational leader, will be an
enormous help to me as I assume
new and larger responsibilities.’-’

Commenting on the loss of Dr.
Rankin, Chancellor Litchﬁeld
said: “Losing Alan is like losing
my right arm. He has been with
me since World War II, in the
tropics and at Cornell.” He called
Rankin’s appointment an “oppor-

tomorrow, Friday, and Saturday at 8:30 p.m. in Foster Memorial and

a matinee Saturday at 2:30 p.m.

«Performances of the University’ Theatre’s production
of Reynard, The Fox, a children’s play produced by the
University Theatre, will open tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. in the
Stephen Foster Auditorium. Subsequent performances will
be given on Friday and Saturday at the same times and one
matinee performance on Saturday at 2:30 p.m.

Reynard, written by Arthur

Sanquez, will not use all the ela- '

borate stage machinery used in
Measure for Measure, according
to Dr. William. H. Kingsley, di-
rector. Although Measure for
Measure’s scenery and costuming
were done entirely in black and
white tones, Dr. Kingsley said
that Reynard “does have color.”
Stereophonic sound will be used
for the first time.

The cast includes Hanish Pat-
rick as Reynard, Ben Hayllar as
Tiecelin, Paul Pennock as Ysen-
grin, Alfred Andrews as Noble,
Jane Glassner as Lendore, Stan
Bernstein as Epinard, and Rob-
ert Horowitz as Brun.

Ann True has designedthe cos-
tumes, Mrs. Brenda Foguel is
choreographing the duels and
Mrs. Dorothy Aldrich is doing an
experimental study of the play’s
philosophy of life on two special
audiences of children.

Miss True’s costume designs
demand the use of a special har-
ness that looks like a chicken
coop with streamers which go
onto the shoulders of the actors
and help to support the heads of
the “dog suits.”

Dr. Kingsley explained that a
“dog suit is a stage term for an
animal costume that covers the
entire body.”

Admission for the play is 50
cents and may be paid at the
door. Ticket reservations may be
made at the Student Union Desk,
the Student Desk in the Cathe-
dral, and the Towers Desk.

The Office of Cultural and Educational ‘Exchange
(OCEE) held a conference on summer study, travel and
work opportunities abroad last Saturday. Dr. Kolbert, Chair-

man of the Department of Romance Languages opened the

program. David Hoppes, Assistant Director of OCEE was
the panel moderator.

Mellon Lecturer Discusses
Meaning of Medieval Music

By J. n. GLASSER
Roman de Fauvel, an illustrated manuscript with mus-
ical interpolations served as a chief example of medieval
polyphony in the Mellon. lecture Monday night by visiting
Andrew Mellon Professor Dragan Plamenac. . '
Professor Plamenac, who lectured on “Music and So-
ciety in the Late Middle Ages,” indicated that present day

students of 14th century poly-
phony are indebted to this manu-
script for much of their informa-
tion about music of the period.

Polyphony is the positioning of
one melodic line against a sec-
ond_ in such a manner that inci-
dental harmony is produced while
the horizontal structure of the
two or more melody lines is
maintained.

Roman de Favel, which is a cri-
tical poem, uses the music and
illustrations to reflect the politi-
cal and social corruptions of the
period. This is done through the
life of the central character, a
stallion named Fauvel,

Historical crises such as the
Babylonian Captivity of the Pope
and the power struggle between
church and state are shown in the
music of the period, Professor
Plamenac explained.

French domination of the mu-
sical world lasted through the
late 13th and early 14th 0311'
turies. _'_I‘heir major type of mu-

Students Hit
Problems of

LA Advisors

Jim Watson, the head of
the Liberal Arts advising
center announced at an SUB
Forum panel discussion last
Friday that the advising cen-
ter has taken “deﬁnite steps
forward.”

The typical audience reaction
gave the impression that the ad-
vising center was taking Lenin's
proverbial two steps backwards
to achieve one step forward.

The discussion, entitled “Ad.
vice and Consen ,” was paneled
by Dr. William B. Crafts, dean
of men; James G. Watson, assis-
tant to the dean of liberal arts;
Nancy Delaney, feature editor of
The Pitt News, and Tomas Zaret,
chairman of the Liberal Arts
Cabinet. Dr. Warren T. Hill, di-
rector of the University Counsel-
ing Service, moderated the after-
noon discussion.

Watson admitted that the lib-
eral arts advising center is “by
no means a perfect system,” but
did claim that “there is now suf-
ﬁcient time for the students to
see their advisors,” and that the
advisors at the underclass level
do act as efficient “information
centers.”

Panel and audience reaction to
these statements produced con-
tradictory information. Where
Watson insisted that a half-hour
is alloted to each student with
an appointment to make out a

schedule, three students in the .

Vf-‘audience claimed that they were
jbrought to feel that a visitation
'to the advising center lasting
iflonger than ten minutes seemed
5-;"i“an imposition” or “an abuse of
L; Fa privilege.”

“Perhaps,” said Miss Delaney,

', “the reason that 100 ‘hours of
ffeach advisors 250 hours of ap-
j-Ifpointment time are not being.
; [used is that the advisor does not
hiiput forward the desire to talk
 to-the students.”

“In answer to Miss Delaney’-s

" "question, Watson replied, “It isn’t
,,_ all that bad if the advisor doesn’t
 know about the courses being of-
. "fere_d. TI: is just as -valuable to
5 take a bad course as it is to take
7. a good course, because you learn
‘fwhat bad courses are like.”

Curriculum proved to be an

 impasse in the discussion. Wat-
; .son insisted that curriculum was
3‘part of the framework within
j,’ which he had to work. The dis-
 tribution of studies program as

set_ up by the curriculum com-

7: mittee is part of the University’s-
': interpretation of a liberal educa-
 tion. To the student unwilling to
;.'accept these limitations, Watson
1 could only suggest one answer,

 YIAIIINDO

I e the advising center, has given that long-awaited answer to undergraduate

complaint about the inadequacies of his department—If you don’t like it,
leave. '

I It's a direct answer, expressed as simply as he could have said it.

-  meant: I am ‘being paid for my administration position. I refuse to com-

mit.» myself to any innovation or to challenge any of my orders for fear of

‘T » my job. My job is more important to me than your complaints, no matter

how justiﬁed. Complain as much as you want, but if you’re serious about
it, leave.

Watson’s case does not stand alone. It echoes of other answers to
other ‘requests. First come rationalizations. If pus-hed there might be a
promise which is usually followed by a meaningless compromise, a com-
promise which gives the administration the right to say, See what we did

I , for you, but one which neatly avoids the original question.

   

decision, and they point next door. Or, I’m sorry but that’s not my area.
I just do my job; I really don’t h:ave any power. But if forced to an honest
answer, like Watson, they give it-—No.

It is tragic when a University, of all places in society, will not even
admit to stimulation and change within itself, when freedom of thought
is something to be humored rather than cultivated, when the same amount
of energy is spent on avoiding change as it would take to incorporate it.

It is ironic that a University should be the hotbed of such conserva-

'tism—and not a legitimate conservatism at that. Conservatism implies a

value on thelstatus quo after all avenues have been considered. Here there
is too much fear on the part of these administrators to even question the
status quo so that they _can decide if it is the best way. '

If you don’t like it, leave—an astounding answer from an open, intel-
lectual community, a leader of the rest of society. The University has cer-
tainly come a long way. It's a cold, efficient business now. And don’t you

All of this is done nicely: I’d like to help you but he makes the

forget it.

Editor, The Pitt News:

A ‘ University has participated in the
__ . Carnegie Foundation’s Europe
A Summer Research Program. This

_ program has been sacriﬁced be-. .
cause of the University’s present ‘

effort to cut spending.

_ _ Each summer approximately 16
‘ students, from major universities
C such , as Princeton, Columbia,
Reed, Swarthmore, Colgate, and
Occidental, are sent to Europe to

do research on a project that the
student himself has designed.
The money provided by the Car-

-negie Foundation is 'matched by3 ‘ ' "

the home university and inﬁthis
way the student is ﬁnanced. Even-

'. tually, the student presents a
thesis that is the result of his

' research.

, — Last summer I was priviledged
to be .a participant in this pro-
gram. The University, I believe,
contributed ﬁve hundred dollars
toward my expenses. The in-

in tellectual experience that I had
cannot be measured‘ i.n__ dollars and

‘cents. For the ﬁr'st'time in my
-life I knew what it means to
push my intellectual capabilities
towards their fullest potentials.

This past October, information
" was again sent to the participat-

 Carnegie Program. Since there
was no money allotted for this

what priority have salary in-

Faculty Can Only Blame Themselves

Editor, The Pitt News: ‘

Pitt’s faculty has no right to complain. If they suddenly ﬁnd themselves ranking in ﬁnancial prior- ‘

ity somewhere behind the put-a-monkeY'°n'MarS" program, they have no one to blame but themselves.
They should not be surprised at either new-foundstatus or their treatment. Lord knows, enough evi-
dence of the general trend of things has been available free—just for the looking.

One upon a time, students were important people, too. Yes, Virginia, even here. They aren't
any more. The faculty watched their de-personaliza tion, watched their reduction from inefficiently cod-
dled, "punch-cardless boobs to streamlined goal-orien ted, pre-professional? scholars.

The faculty watched as the educational system here was remodeled in the corporate image of

‘its Maker, watched as every non-efficient second of reﬁection was antiseptically removed as just" so
much waste. And when one of their number ﬁnally had the guts to protest publically, they laughed be-
hind his back and called him a pompous old ass. Then they'went back to their monograph writing.
Publish or perish, you know.

AND THE FACULTY WATCEED as deans and their assistants, liberal and otherwise, conduct-
ed their personal vendettas against the possibilities of gaining an education at Pitt. They watched as
.a mockery was made of the concept of a liberal education by a combination of restrictions—aca-

demic and social—under which creative development is effectively thwarted. They watched as, des-

pite opposition budgetary considerations began to dictate admission policy. And they’ all made their
own little jokes about the library.

’ So now they’re feeling the pinch where it seems to hurt. If they do in fact ﬁnd themselves
“just .another material factor on a graph of growth,” then gentlemen, welcome to the club. You watched
as administrators told us that this University is not being run for the undergraduate student, And
you left us to ﬁght our own battles to change that situation. So now you've been told where you stand,
too. Perhaps you don’t deserve any better. And like the man says, if you don’t like it here, you can
always go somewhere else. «

_ In 499 B.C., Socrates was condemned to death. Plato tells us that in his trial Socrates called him-
self the “gad-ﬂy” of the Athenian people. Gentlemen of the faculty, are you gad-ﬂies or drones?

It is now almost two years since any portion of the faculty has chosen to commit itself publicly
on an issue of importance to both the University community and the general public. The momentous
occasion was the appearance at a University Convocation of Edward Teller. A group of physicists from
the University saw ﬁt to condemn his appearance, Then Professor Lawrence Lee of the English Depart-
ment stated that the University was favoring brawn over brains—-or was it brains over brawn? A com-
mittee was appointed to investigate this dastardly charge, but its report, if one has been made, has
been lost somewhere under a stack of IBM_ cards. V

Why has no professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, or graduate assistant
chosen to write a Letter-to-the-Editor concerning the war in Viet-Nam? Why have there been no letters
related to the Congo crisis, where human beings have been eating other human beings alive? Where
is there any debate about the University’s role inthe civil rights revolution.

Thus far, there have been few gadﬁies. It seems that the faculty has. been effectively silenced.

THE BULLETIN OF THE School of the Liberal Arts states as “The Value of a Liberal Educa-
tlon” on page 1 that “Education is not conﬁned to the school and university. . . . A university educa-
tion is successful when it stimulates an expanding intellectual curiosity. A lifetime characterized by
activity of thought and its application is the mark of an educated man.” The University community as
a whole has lost sight of these goals. The American univers-ity system is not producing educated men.

We are producing robots who walk through life without permitting life to touch them.

It would’be much more effective to be able to hand each and every faculty member a subpoe-
na and to force him to defend himself. With what would he defend himself? The role of the educated
person in today"s society is still the same as it was over 20 centuries ago: to be a judge of the status
quo. Gentlemen where is your indictment?

As the writers of this letter, it is evident that we have been administered a bitter taste of
hemlock. Our education, whatever there is of it, is much too valuable to us permit us to sign our names.

Names were withheld on the above letters at the request of the writers.

 

'étndent.wh° so desires t° Pursue -

his education at the graduate lev-
el, then the sacriﬁce of the Car-
negie Program is unforgiveable.

It is too late to reverse the
decision and participate in 1966.
Applications are due Dec. 10. Yet

I cannot help thinking that the.

decision not to participate was
made all too quickly. I don’t know
who made it. If the University is
again invited to participate it
would be highly regrettable if
money were again the obstacle.

Bigots Told to
Go Elsewhere

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a tower dweller, I am thor-
oughly ashamed of theactions of
a few of the people I reside with.
In a state which encourages free:
dorri of religion, race, and creed,‘
it is shame to have to ﬁnd such
anti-Semetic remarks as one ﬁnds

scribbled on the walls of the

tower elevators.
,Any person who would lower
himself to such underhanded and

immatu1:e- ..,methods_ .is obviously A

   

too much afraid of his own so-
ciety to present his thoughts
openly to the public. This is a
free university, in a free state,
in a free country, and if a per-
son does not approve of the peo-
ple he is living with, he is free
at any time to leave this univer-
sity, state, or even country.

I suggest that these persons in-

volved either make plans to at-_

tend a university catering only
to their religion (if they have
one) or to keep their comments
to themselves.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR   E

Soccer Player

Continues Feud
Editor, The Pitt News:

It amazes me how fast experts
are trained in The Pitt News
sports section. I am referring to
Bill Cabin, the reporter cover-
ing the soccer team’s progress
throughout the season.

He ﬁrst started reporting about
soccer at the beginning of the
past season, approximately the,

V ﬁrst week in September and

since then, in a span of three
months, has become an expert
on soccer, or so it seems.

If I remember correctly he
did not have any previous soccer
knowledge and I believe if he
were shown a volleyball and a
soccerball today, he could not
discriminate between the two. Of
course, Mr. Cabin picked up all
the knowledge needed to criticize
a coach, who has been connected
with soccer here at Pitt since its
beginning, in three months.

But that is not enough. He also
disagrees with the organization
of the team. I would like for Mr.
Cabin to tell me, basing his de-
cision on his “long” experience
with varsity sports, what the

duties of a captain or co-captain _

are if not to communicate be-
tween players and ‘the coach.

Harm to a team can come in
many ways, and poor reporting
by incompetent personnel can
just as surely ruin the morale of a
team as "any other cause. I sug-
gest that Mr, Cabin base his
opinions on knowledge about the

‘game instead of hear-say!

organization there will be a

charge.

Any interested student can ﬁnd
means to travel abroad. There
are student ships and tours and

Schottenheimer, Popp   

Join AFL, NFL Teams;
Ready for Challenge

By BILL CABIN
Linebackers Marty Schottenheimer and Ray Popp sign-

ed professional football contracts last week, but they will be

in different leagues. Schottenheimer signed with the Buf-
falo Bills of the American Football League, while Popp
joined the New York Giants of the National Football League.

Schottenheimer rejected an offer from the Baltimore

Colts, the Western Division Cham-
pions in the NFL, to sign with
Buffalo. “Money was not a fac-
tor,” Schottenheimer said, “since
both teams offered me the same
amount. I also had no preference
for playing in either league, be-
cause I feel they’ll be the same
in four or ﬁve years.”

The key factors in his choice
were the city of Buffalo and
Tom Gallagher, Buffalo’s General
Manager. “Mr. Gallagher has
been in contact with me since
last June," Schottenheimer said,
“but the Colts didn’t contact me
until a week before the draft.”

“My father originally lived in
Buffalo,” he continued, “and he
knows the people and says it's a
great sports town. It's the type of
place where _I _might like to set-
tle down. I had no knowledge
about Baltimore.”

Schottenheimer rebukes critics
who say that he went to the AFL
because it is easier. “I feel I
could make it in either league,”
he said. “Ironic as it may seem,

, there may have been more oppor-

tunity on the Colts.” He also
feels that if he reaches 240
pounds, he might be used as a
defensive end.

Popp, however, was drafted by
the New York Jets and theGi.ants
as a junior eligible last year. “I
chose the Giants because I want-
ed to make the NFL," Popp said._

RAY POP!’
Accepts Pro Challenge

“The NFL is more settled and
they play a better brand of foot-
ball. It means more to me to
make a team in a better league.

Although Popp admits it's tough
for any linebacker to make the
pros, he accepts the challenge.
“It’s tough for any linebacker to
make a team, because the pros
are bigger, faster, and more ex-
perienced.”

 
 

By FRANK SMIZIK
' The basketball team is
having their problems with
shooting so far this season.

They're averaging less than
forty per cent and it lost
them one game and almost

another.

In the VPI game the Panthers
shot 31 per cent, and also had a
dismal 57 per cent at the foul
line. According to Coach Tim-
mons, the team beat VPI only
by forcing them into mistakes,
and not by their Offensive play.

Against Carnegie Tech, the
hoopsters shot 48 per cent to
Tech’s 42 per. cent, while out-
shooting the Tartans by 21 shots.

The poor shooting was at its
peak in the Miami game. “Miami
didn’t play any defense at all,”
said Timmons, “and although we
had so many free shots, our guys
had trouble with the arena bas-
kets.”

Hoopm Offensive pm. 
Hindered by Shooting Skill 

To compensate for the shoot-
ing problems, the hoopsters have
played an agressive defense. “Our
guards would drop back to help
on Rick Barry and we'd double
and triple team him. The guards
would constantly switch-off to

keep the other team confused,”

said Timmons.

Timmons kept switching guards
and forw.ards in an effort to im-
prove shooting. No one could
shoot consistently enough to give

   

T?
the team momentum. They hus-
tled on defense and stole the
ball from Miami on numerous in-
tercepted passes, despite the lack
of offensive momentum.

Timmons was trying to slow
the Hurricanes down, but the in-
experience of his ball players
played havoc with his game plan’?
“We either came down and shot
too quickly, or we held the ball
too long and lost it,” said Tim-
mons.

Physics Prof.
From China

  At Titusville

By BOB ZALZNECK

Dr. Shih -chi Chang, as-
sistant professor of physics
at the Titusville campus, was
born in 1933 in the Province
of Honan in the central part
of China, only four years

before the Japanese inva-
sion. Thirty years later, he re.

ceived a Ph.D. in physics from
Kansas State University.

Dr. Ch.ang’s family was forced
to move to the mountains "of
western China‘ during the inva-
sion years.  the war they
lived for a few years at Shang-
hai until the Communist troops
besieged the city, in 1949, when
they moved to Formosa.

Although the situation was
difficult, Dr. Chang received reg-
ular schooling, ﬁnishing his high
school education at Chien Kuo
Middle School, Taipei, in 1951.
Thereafter. he entered Taiwan
ﬁaivetsify in the‘ same city,

where he majored in Electrical ,

Engineering, In 1955, he obtain-
ed his B.S. degree, and in 1956,
he came to the U.S. to study
physics at Kansas State Univer-
sity. He was awarded his M.S. in
1958 and his Ph.D. in 1963.

Dr. Chang explained that in a
modern Chinese school, along
with courses in Chinese, mathe-
matics, science, and physical edu-
cation, English is taught from
seventh grade until the ﬁrst year
of college.

In the remaining years of col-
lege, the student frequently uses
English textbooks, although he
usually lacks opportunities to
practice speaking English.

Dr. Chang started to speak
English only after he arrived in
the United States. His eight years
of experience of speaking English
provide Dr. Chang with the abil-
ity to assume the responsibility
of a teacher.

Since Dr. Chang did research
for his master’s thesis on the dif-
fusion in solids by using radio-
active tracer techniques. For his

Ph.D. he studied X-ray, crystal-

lography. After that, he worked
as a post-doctoral research asso-
ciate at the Crystallography Lab
at the University’s Oakland cam-
pus for almost two years.

Dr, Chang has found teaching
an enjoyable job. He may con-
tinue to work as a teacher of
physics, however, it is also his
desire to teach some advanced
courses -and to participate in ac-

tive research in the meantime.

Remain Numerous

Although the curriculum at Titusville is still limited,
the social life is not. Since the ﬁrst day of the trimester,
Titusville students and faculty have attended receptions,
dances, football games, movies and lectures.

The sophomore class sponsored a student-faculty picnic
and dance on October 17; the freshman class sponsored a
dance at the Titusville Elk’s Club to which they invited

Edinboro State College students.

Campus Centered in Historic,
Spectacular McKinney Mansion

By CALVIN RITCHEY

The Titusville Campus of
the University of Pittsburgh
is housed in the former L.C.
McKinney estate mansion, a
monument from the Town’s
wealthy, oil-splashed past.

Built in 1870 at a cost of $35,-
000 by Mr. and Mrs. John C.
Bryan, the 25-room building and
grounds were valued at nearly
$150,000 when Mrs. John S. Has-
kell of Titusville gave the prop-
erty to the University last year.

The story of the mansion is
not only the story of the oil-
made fortunes of Titusville, but
is directly linked to the begin-
nings of the oil and steel indus-
tries in northwestern Pennsyl-
vania.

Oil was ﬁrst discovered at
Drake Well, only two miles from
the mansion in 1859. By the end
of the Civil War oil was king at
Titusville, During the oil boom.
when Titusville boasted more
than 10,000 residents and listed
more than 30 multi-millionaires
among the town’s society, Mc-
Kinney Mansion was built.

The 94-year history of the man.
sion began Sept. 3, 1870, when
the Bryan ‘family bought four
lots on Brown Street for about
500. The Titusville Herald of Sept.
21, 1871, published a list of new
homes in the town that year. In-
cluded in the list of new build-
ings on Main Street was “John
C. Bryan, two-story brick man-
sard, 62 by 83 feet, $35,000.”

Bryan sold the house in 1872

BUILT IN 1870 at a cost of $35,000, the L. C. McKinney Estate is now
the home of the Titusville Campus of the University of Pittsburgh.
The mansion is modeled after a French chateau and has marble ﬁre-
places throughout the classrooms. The University bought the mansion

in 1963.

for a proﬁt of $8,000, and there-
after the building changed hands
several times. In 1882, John D.
Archbold, then owner of the
house, sold it to the Standard
Oil Co. for a price of $1, accord-
ing to official deeds.

In'1925, the McKinney family
purchased the property for $17,-
000, and reportedly spent one
million dollars remodeling it. The

THIS FIREPLACE is one of ﬁve which adorn the classrooms at the
Titusville Campus. All are hand-carved marble or stone and were
imported from Italy in 1927. Another classroom feature is wall-to-

wall 

 

McKinneys lived in the home un-
til 1957, when it was sold to
Haskell, again at the price of
one million dollars.

The University “bought” the
property from Mrs. Haskel in
1963 for $1. A campaign raised
$430,000 to subsidize the campus.

* About $170,00 of this amount was
used in remodeling the building
to accomodate the college.

The mansion is modeled after
the exterior plan of a French
chateau, the name and location
of which have been lost. Much
of the original art work has been
retained in the renovated college
building. In the main foyer a
chandelier hangs from the two-
story ceiling adorned with Ita-
lian art between the walnut
beams. Hand-carved marble ﬁre-
places are located throughout the
classrooms.

The southwest classroom on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor contains a mural
of the entrance to the mansion.
Its book shelves are walnut.

Paintings from the John Jacob
Astor house in New York are
framed in the ceiling of the first
floor conference room. a master-
piece of Venetian architecture. A
cone-shaped fireplace, intricately
carved with spirals and lion-heads,
and the polished glazed-brick
floors are authentic Italian st les.
Doors leading to Presidem Joe
M. Ball’s office are of leaded
glass, highlighted with stained-
glass inserts.

This will be the last of the

four regional campuses supple-
ment pages in the Pitt News. The
stories and pictures were prepar.
ed by the students at the indi-

vidual campuses.

Individual faculty members
have also entertained the stu-

dents. Mr. and Mrs. Riggio of the _

Romance Language Department
showed slides of France and
Spain. They have also planned
informal discussions of music
composers.

The movie series, presented at
the library auditorium, consists
of Classic movies selected by Mrs.
Buckwalter. The series includes

From Here to Eternity, The Prisr‘

oner, Orson Welles’ Macbeth, A
Raisin in the Sun, The Mouse

Waterfront, and Lost Horizon.

Mrs. Buckwalter, the librarian
at Titusville, planned a faculty-
student coffee hour at the library.

In December, some faculty mem- ’

hers will present a reading of
Dylan Thomasn’s “A Child*s
Christmas in Wales.”

After attending a ministerial re-
a t t h e Presbyterian
Chuch, the clergy and students
organized a Young People’s Fel-

Increase in
Enrollment

Campus Goal‘-

By 1970, school officials said
there will be from 500-700 stu-
dents attending the University at
Titusville. To accommodate this
increase in students, the campus
hopes to expand its size and the
number of courses offered.

Expansion will
acquisition of more ground for
buildings, both for classrooms and
for student activities. It will be
necessary to build dormitories for
men and women. College officials
also hope to acquire land for rec-
reation and thus expand its intra-
mural program.

Scholastically, the University at’

Titus .ille hopes to expand its un.
dergraduate program on the
freshman and sophomore level.
This would include an increase
in the number of departments as
well as the courses.

“There are absolutely no plans
for a four-year institution here,”

the Titusville Campus of the Uni.”
