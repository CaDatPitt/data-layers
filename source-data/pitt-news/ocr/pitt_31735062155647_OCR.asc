 Tech snubs
his Rally Pact

' \

 

By JOHN NEY

The “rally damage pact”
which was drawn up at Car-
negie Institute of Technology
Oct. 1, was -rejected by the
Tech Student Council. last
week.

The proclamation, (drafted. by

student leaders and faculty rep-
resentatives from Pitt, Tech,,Du-
quesne and Pennsylvania College
for Women stated that each
group will “assume financial re-
sponsibility for
done” by students from those in-
stitutions. The whole thing was
“vaguely worded and loosely
phrased,” according to" Tech Stu-
dent Council President Ray «Se-
bulsky. '

The Tech Tartan reported that
“various views of the members
of Council were that the resolu-
tion was loosely phrased and sub-

ject to many and varied interpre- ,
added that
“they (Student Council) didn’t ‘

tations.” Sebulsky
like the idea .of dealing severely
(with stud_ent violators” as recom-
mended by “the pact.” -

The Tech Student Council-will
meet today to draw up anew
proclamation. According to Sebul—
sky, if this document is passed it
will be submitted to ‘Pitt, D_u—
quesne and PCW for approval.

Even if it is not approved by

_the other schools Sebulsky says
“it will be our view on the situa-
tion.”

Although Pitt Student Congress
signed the original document,
President Ross Reese said, “It (the
pact) seemed clear to us but we
will be glad to consider any new
proclamation.”

Wlmit/'3 The TraubIe? 

Carnegie Tech’s Student .,Con-
gress recently defeated a motion
to_ accept the so-calléd ‘_‘Anti-Vic-
tory Rally” pact that has been ap-

proved by Pitt, That they disap-

proved of the agreement‘ is not so
startling until one discovers that

_, the "Tech delegation conceived of

the idea to formulate the pact,
presided at the meeting of the
school representatives, and even
had one of their number complete
the ﬁnal draft of the statement.
But, when the motion was placed
onthe block, the dissenters won
their point with a’vote that con-
trasted sharply with the Pitt Stu-
dent Congress unanimous»appr9v-
al.

,Now we don’t believe that
Tech’s solons are so superior to
ours that they can discover hidden
ﬂaws that were not discernible to
the Pittites nor do we believe that
two such similar groups could
take such opposite stands on the
phraseology of the pact.

Tech congressmen complained
that the whole thing was “vaguely
worded ‘and loosely phrased.”
They further opined that it was
“subject to many and varied in-
terpretations.” It hardly seems
possible that their opinions could
have changed overnight or that
the views of the Tech congress-
men could be completely at odds"
with, their representatives who
originally helped .compose the

document. Thepreasons behind this

turn,-about are beyond us and *

   
 

Pitt’s congressmen who are mildly
ﬂabbergasted and slightly confus-
ed and have adopted a" “wait-and-
see” attitude. Of course they may
have to wait until Tech hashes, re-
hashes and scrambles the matter
but then Tech doesn’t seem to be
in any hurry to take steps to pro-
tect their campus or ours. The
ﬁrst victory rally might speed
things up but the horse will _be
far away and the barn door will

_swing shut on an empty stable.

 

Oklahoma 5
In Agreement

A news release from the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma tends to agree
with the result of last year’s con-
troversy which prohibited wives
and sweethearts from having tick-
ets for the student section at Pitt’s
football games. '

The Okies have had, for some
time, a system whereby wives and
sweethearts of students were given
tickets to attend their games in the
student sections; University offi-
cials have found that these _ducats
were being peddled to outsiders at
considerable proﬁt. _, '

Back-checking has revealed that
legally married spouses were get-
ting four tickets, two for their own
use; the other two being sold to
outsiders. . ' ‘ ' t ‘

Scandinavian Groupi

Offers European Tour
' ' ' By IRENE RCZAKIS
Students who want to see Europe can travel with a 30-

member seminar this summer on a Grand Tour of the con-
tinent sponsored by the Scandinavian Traveling Seminar of

Washington, D. C. .

The trip will include 66 days in England, France, Switzer-
land, Italy, San Marino,. Austria; ,

Germany, Denmark, and Holland
at the price of $770, not including
transportation across the Atlantic.

If the student wi-shes to exclude
the visit to England, he can join
the group in Paris, and travel the
remaining 57 ‘ days at a cost of
$685.

Students Examples of Normal

‘ Americans

According to'Arne Sorensen and
Karen J orgensen, representatives
of the Danish government, the
Scandinavian group‘ would .like to
help erase the common misconcep-
tion held by Europeans that the
average American is a Senator
McCarthy, a Robert Taylor, or an
Ava Gardner. ’

This, they feel, can be accom-
plished by sending over groups
of students who represent the
normal American.

From June 30 to July 6, the
group will visit such places as
Westminster Abbey, Parliament,
and Stratford-on-Avon in Eng-
land. They will travel to Paris to

see the Louvre, Notre Dame, and
Napoleon’s Tomb.

They will spend four days in
Paris. At Tours,‘ France, the sem-
inar will see the famous castles of
the Loire valley, then travel to
Montignac in Southwestern France.

~When Student Corigress and the’ Pitt News began plan-

- ningrthe bus trip to Northwestern, some parties felt that

the Northwestern -game and‘ visit to Chicago _would not
packnenough drawing power for the price ‘involved. Now
that the trip has been cancelled, we can sit back and second-
guess. The trip failed because there was no punch behind

it. Publicity was mediocre and lacked enthusiasm and spirit.

Few people talked about ‘the -trip in ‘anything more than
curious tones and those that did were generally ignored.-

-,There was just no feeling behind the project," Casting no-

slurson Northwestern university, they still do not have the

 attraction of a trip to Wes_t'Point, Notre Dame .or Michigan _
rState,‘which were the locations of the three previous trips.

Frankly, we can’t ‘blame the students for refusing to meet’
the $19.25 bustrip fee for the sake of a game and six hours
in Chicago. It will probably be a good game, and Chicago

is awonderful town, but it just isn’t worth it.

Don't ,Forget . ..

pi, Dances, rushing, Hallowe’en parties, football games, are

foremost in_ collegiate minds these days, crowding out for

the most part the desire for quiet contemplation, or the
' serene and unhurried perusal of books.

There are books, shelves and shelves of them, and hush-
e_d, sunlit rooms. to read them in on the ﬁfth and sixth
ﬂoors. There’s the cool austerity of’ the periodical room,
the busy rustle of. the reference room and the reserve book
rooms, _and the Alldred Room, comfortable as a living room,
with a selection of "books to make_ any bibliophile’s.—mouth

It seems a shame to let the libraries go to waste.

   Woro|s Are Inefficient

By Ruth Heimbuecher

Words “are, for the most part, ineﬁicient de-
vices for communication. In some cases, they ful-
ﬁll their mechanical duties—-like telling the.grocer
how many pounds of tomatoes to weigh out, or
saying a number to the telephone‘ operator, or giv-
ing directions to the nearest gas station.

But usually, do words convey what is actually

stant use, do words gradually
lose their meanings? The English
language, or any language, is fill-
ed with phrases that are suppos-
ed to be symbolic of the speak-
er’s emotions and yet, what does
“thank you” mean, after all?

Doesn't Express Feeling

We say it for a piece of bread,
as well as for a diamond. We
thank people for compliments. But the simple
phrase can never express the depth or shallowness

_ of feeling behind it.

“Congratulations” is another overworked word.

' It seems to be apropos for every occasion, from

winning a golf match to becoming a father.

talk, to say “I’m . sorry” for misdeeds. So when
little Dennis" kicks Uncle Herbert in the shins, he
immediately saves himself with “I’m sorry” While
he is inwardly chuckling at the red creeping up
Uncle Herbert’s neck, like mercury in a thermo-
meter. D

“You have my “sympathy” we say to the be-
reaved, yet while our hearts are aching with their
sadness, the automatic phrase is almost meaning-
less in comparison.

T/‘ieanings Dulled

' There are other phrases: happy birthday, pardon ~'

me, .bon voyage, welcome home, God bless you, good
luck. Their meanings have been dulled by time,
obscured by overuse, or are just plain inadequate
To carry the burden of feeling they'shou1d.
There is no solution. Articulateand facile speak-
ers may experiment with new combinations of
words, but the inarticulate must plod along with‘ the
handiest words and phrases, knowing they can never
come close enough in, speech to what they mean,
struggling dumbly to portray their feelings of love,
sorrow, anger, joy.-’ - - L L ‘ '
Our ancestors in Eolithic times ,may not have‘

Tech Editor «Visits Pitt

1 "By Jim DeWees_e _
Dick Durstine, crusading editor ofthe Carnegie

Tech Tartan, condesended to pay Pitt a visit last
Monday. ’ - ' ’

Durstine was interviewed in the Dean’s ofﬁce‘
on the eighth floor. He stated that he had traveled .

from his oﬂice at the “institution” to speak to the
Dean of Men regarding the throwing away of his
papers sent to Pitt. 4‘ V " .

“I’ve got an idea -‘who the culprit_ is” mut—,
tered Durstine. “But I can’t disclose this “informa-
tion ,of course.”' A sly glint appeared in his eye
as he growled “I. just thought I’d put in a gripe
to the Dean.”_

A Bit of Logic .

When queried about the P_itt—Notre Dame foot-
ball contest Durstine gave a terse “No comment.”
“I’m not much of a football fan but I‘ do know you
lost?’ I had to admit-that his clever deduction -had
trappedme. He was irrevocably correct in thispbit
of logic. L

Durstine was dressed in a light blue suit and
one could have walked right past him before realiz-
ing that he was indeed a newspaper man. When
offered a smoke, he declined. He may have feared
poison, and then again, he simply may not smoke.

A Cafeteria Possibility  . .

'TL’|1e Case for Pizza

The Tartan is put out once a week by the in-.
trepid newsmen at Tech. Durstine stated that his
staff is comprised mainly of engineering students.
He personallyputs in about “2O hours” per week ‘
on,» the paper while studying Industrial Manage-
ment. This may have some bearing on the quality
of the Tartan. - I '

~ Durstinei Downcost

. Durstine seemed rather downcast, so, in an effort
to make a smile appear on his sensitive face, the -
statement that‘ was made that the Tartan was by C
no means an amateur paper. A cascade of pride,

. which immediately poured from this light haired‘

lad in the form of happy? vocal agreement, almost
swamped the oﬁ"ice. , A
At this point in his verbal exchange he stopped
in the foyer of the Dean’s Office and leaned with
nonchalance upon the Panther. The joyous ut-
terings which had burst fgrth momentarily had,
once" again subsided so he stood in wordless con-
ﬂic_t while a couple of photographers made trial

runs on their cameras.

"Rover" Durstine V

_ One of the secretaries from the Dean’s oﬁice
called Mr.'Durstine’s name and his ears cooked
in recognition as he trotted into -the office.

Why not introduce pizza to
cafeteria patrons? ‘At ﬁfteen or
twenty cents a slice, you cOuldn’t
go wrong. The University
wouldn’t have to hire an.Italian
chef either, for everyone’s con-
cocting the. succulent substance
nowadays.

For instance, when I was in
New York for the Pitt‘-Army

game last year, I stopped in one i

of the many - pizzerias . lining
Broadway. After tasting the tan-
gy treat, I remarked to the cur-
ly - haired, dark - complexioned
vendor, “Que pizza buon!” (What
good pizza!) -

Best Not Enough

No answer-.—and the Italians
are ﬁrst to acknowledge a com-
pliment. I repeated the phrase,
using the best Italian I could
muster.

Still no answer. So I resorted ’

to English. This brought results.

I blandly reprimanded the guy

Which all goes to show
universality of pizza. The stuff

pizza and pronounce it correctly

the pizzeria (accent over the i),

s and the baker is the pizzaiulo

(.you-got'me on that one).

This dish ﬁt for a king actually
got its start that way. In the
17th century, King Ferdinand
noticed one of his subjects pat-
ting a piece of dough into round
pies (Ughl), ate one and ordered
the. baker to the royal palace.
There an oven was installed and
pizzes were made for the king
and his court.

In its classical form, pizza is a
wafer-thin stretch of bread dough
laden with tomato paste, cheese,
olive oil, garlic, pepper, and Ore-

DEW-59_!_i1l5eekS To Nip Letdown

Northwestern Next Foe;lF§e::;nd Half Story

Aerial Attack Stressed

By DAVE MAZER

One of the hardest problems Coach Red Dawson faces‘

this weeklas he preps his "squad for Northwestern‘ is that
all-important‘ psychological eﬁ“ect._ _ i » i ,
After playing Notre Dame in such a high—strung battle,
the team'is due for a letdown and Dawson knows it. “This
usually happens after a game like that, and it happened
to us last year, but we’ll try to prevent it occuringagain,”

. Panther

 

was the head- mentor’s_ answer .

when asked about a possible let-
down.

‘Northwestern will be the first
of two Big Ten foes the Pan-
thers engage this year and, al-
though they have a 2-2 record,
they have shown a good enough
oﬁense to down
Army.and Iowa
State while
putting up“ a
tough struggle
before bowing
to Michi ga n

20-12.

The Wild-
cats’ other de-
feat was a solid
blasting by Big
Ten power -
Minnesota, 30-12, the Blue and
Gold’s opponent next week.

Dawson

Dawson has been followingsthe .

sarnelpattern as in the past as far
as practices are concerned this
week, but a deﬁnite stress on
passing can.be seen.

To date, the Panthers have ex-

hibited a ﬁne running game, but

once an'aerial "offense is needed,
the Pitts fall short} In_the four
games, fullback Bobby .Epps has
gained more ground than the en-
tire Pitt passing attack.
Epps Way Ahead

Other teams have come to dis-
regard the Parither’s passing and
have concentrated their defense
to stop Epps and the rest of the
ground gainers. The
Swissvale ,lad has stepped 253
yards in 61 attempts for a 4.1 av-
erage, and that is 50 yards better
than the Panthers have accumu-
lated in 54 passing attempts.

Also, the Dawsonmen have yet
to complete a touchdown pass, but
have not allowed an opponent to
cross the goal line via the air,
either. -

This situation, however, seems

Boote/rs Meet
Gators Today

The Pitt" soccer team will be

looking for its ﬁrst win of the

season today as they meet rugged
Allegheny College at Meadville,
Pa. The Panther record, not in-
dicative of the type of soccer play-
ed, shows a loss to Grove City and
and a ‘1-1 tie with Indiana.

Leo Bemis, adviser to the team,
rates Allegheny on an even par
with Grove City, conquerers of

"Pitt by 5-0 last week, but indi-

cates that the game will be a lot
closer because of new additions to
the squad.
. Besides strengthening the squad
with more capable players, a new
type ‘three-man defense has been
added which, when coupled with
Pitt’s sharp short-passing attack,
should make things tough for the
Gators. The boys have evidenced
a lot of spirit on the practice ﬁeld,
and it can‘t be-more than a matter
of time, it is felt, until Pitt wins
her laurelsl on the soccer ﬁeld, too.

In the recent elections held by
the club, Gil Simons again made

Harriers Poe Icet Sixth;
Point F orA rmyF riday

By PAUL HARRISON‘ _
Panther harriers proved Saturday they could outdistance
two teams as easily as they conquered single opponents when

they romped over Columbia and Rutgers in New York for
their sixth consecutive victory.

Coach Carl Olson’s men not only
walked off the course victors over
the two annually strong squads but
also scored_ their ﬁfth straight
shutout ‘in as many meets. The
scores were: Pitt 15, Columbia_57

' and Rutgers 71.

lEla'ted over
-their victory,
the thinclads
have now set
their sights on
the Army har-
r i e r s wit h
w h o m t h e y
will tangle on
Friday at West
P o in t. This
contest is con.-_ Olson
sidered “the” meet by Olson be-
cause the Cadets have already ‘
disposed of the only other ma-
jor threat to the-Panthers, Villa-
nova, by theiscore of 29-31.

The future vArmy officers now
show a four and one record with
only thepowerful Providence be-
ing able to knock them off. In a
triangular meet last season, with
the locals and Syracuse, the Army
aggregation came out second best
to; the Orangemen' while .Pitt
placed third. \ _.

Last -Saturday, for the ﬁfth time.
this season, four or more Olsonmen

  

tied for ﬁrst place in the four and
a half mile jaunt. Running true to
form, co-captain Don DelliGatti,
Walt Starz, bob Cherry, and Allen
Gunderson humbled the opposition
by crossing the tape fully 50 sec-
onds before their nearest rival at
26:07.3. .-

Co-captain D'a n S o m m e r

liant try to nose out the front
. runners but had to settle for’

the Panther varsity by checking ’

in at 27:07.

the Pitt harriers swelled their vic-

U Sad   Travails
Of a Spotter

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

 

 

It is not the purpose of this column to offer any bad criticism of

,_.a fellow journalist trying to make his way in this world, but per-

haps you will appreciate the following if only for its humorous ele-
ments. The writer of the letter below, Carroll Cook, has spotted a
number of times for various broadcasters, not to mention being Chet
Smith’s private proof—reader, before his moment of great disillusion-
ment when he ﬁnally got his chance to work with a major network
announcer. His report: i
This letter is not intended to take anything away from Notre
Dame, which has probably the best team in the country, but let
me tell you what happened last Saturday at South Bend.

I had the privilege of spotting for Harry Wismer, who was bring-
ing a description of the Pitt-ND game to theater viewers through-
out the country. , - .

A Although I thought Wismer was’ prejudiced toward Notre Dame,
Ithought that he did an adequate play—by-play of the g<'=1me- When
the game was /over, Wismer paid the Notre Dame spotter and. me
ten dollars each. As I prepared to leave the booth, the Notre Dame

_ spotter, a senior, grabbed me and told me what he thought of Wis-.

\

mer’s‘ announcing. ,-
“I wanted to grab that mike,” he said, “and tell the P1501318
what a great team Pitt is. I never knew how prejudiced these
announcers were. If I were you, I would be boiling mad-

“Although nearly all the people who watch this game at the-

theatre are Notre Dame fans, there is no reason why they cannot -be
told what a great team Pitt is. Announcers do not have to be so
one-sided.” -.

As I think back over the game, I now realize how correct this

:observation was, although I was too wrapped up in the game to
notice it at that time

In the ﬁrst place, Wismer always -reminded the audience how
Notre Dame’s second team moved against the Panthers, but never
did he mention that Red Dawson also used his "second string at
the same time. ,

Wismer’s helper, Whose name escapes me at the moment, was
very pro—Notre Dame. At half time, he was urging the ‘people to be
sure to buy tickets to the Georgia 'I‘ech—Notre Dame game.

“This game will bring together two unbeaten teams,” he told the
audience. _ S , 5

At the time, Pitt was leading, 14-7, but this fellow knew all
the time that Pitt was going_ to lose.

I wonder if Frank Leahy did.

This same gentleman kept informing the people in the first
quarter what a great, diversiﬁed attack the Irish had. At that time,

the Pitts were pushing Notre Dame all over the-turf. However, this —.

did not matter to him. . ,
During the second half, Wismer informed the audience of
_Notre Dame’s great comeback and kept mentioning the names
of Neil Worden, Ralph Gugliemiiand Johnny Lattner. Very seldom
did he point out a Pitt player for his outstanding play, although
he did mention Dick‘ Deitrick’s name once or twice.

As usual, a few telegrams were read to the fans, although not
as many as in the past. Wismer’s helper said a cheery “hello” to
all the theater managers.’ , i '

But, to me, the funniest incident "concerned Bobby Epps and Dick
Groat. I had told Wismer that Epps attended the same high school
as Groat. . . \-

AAfter Epps had made a nice run, Wismer toldythe fans,’
"That was Bobby Epps who went to the same high school as
Dick Groat, an All-American in football, basketball and baseball
at . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .” '

Suddenly stopping, he whispered in my ear, “What college?”

“Duke,” I said. a _

Quickly returning to the mike, he said, “At Duke University.”

By the way, Groat never'played football in college.

Although very prejudiced, Wismer. is a great guy. ‘But I think
the impression that he gave to his audience last Saturday was terri-
ble. A person who was unaware of what was happening would have
gotten the idea that Notre Dame was the only team on the ﬁeld.

But after seeing Ralph Gugiliemi’s face on television Sunday
night, it was evident that Pitt at least showed up for the game.
