CMU incidents prompt Pitt Police increase

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Department of Public
Safety has stepped up its patrols
after a series of sometimes violent
attacks against students around
the Carnegie Mellon University
campus.

Walt Waters, first assistant for
Public Safety, said that none of
these incidents have occurred
here at Pitt, but he added, “I’m
keeping my fingers crossed.”

Waters said that campus police
have increased patrols of both
walking police and police car
beats. “Our patrols are bei 1g more
vigil because of this,” he said.
“We just have to be extra alert,
because you never know whether
or not it will happen here.” L

However, the Pittsburgh Press
reported that a foreign Pitt student
was involved in an incident similar

to those reported at CMU. The
actors posed as law enforcement
agents and attempted to coax
money from the woman.

Sergeant William Ricci of CMU
police said that three attacks have
taken place so far. “Two people
were robbed at the Mellon Bank
[automatic-teller] machine at the
corner of Fifth Avenue and Craig
Street,” he said. “Another student
was taken into a car, robbed,
beaten and stabbed with a small
knife. He luckily managed to get
away.”

Ricci said that, along with
increased patrols of the area, the
policetforce has also increased
crime prevention programs for
CMU students. “We have an
ongoing crime prevention
program at the university,” he
said. “Right now we are increasing
the programs in the dormitories.
We are going to try to beat this

two ways: through training and
education and with increased
patrols.”

Waters said that Pitt has a similar
program for the students, but that
the program is set up by the
dorms. “If the RA’s in the dorms
ask for a program, we have
somebody from our community
relations department come in and
talk to them,” he said. He also
said that although the dormitories
have asked for such programs in
the past, none have. asked for

» them since the attacks.

“Two incidents haven’t really
alarmed students yet,” he said.
He added that this could change
if an attack takes place here.

Waters said that one possible
reason Pitt hasn’t had a similar
problem is because of a greater
number of both campus and city
police. “The area around Forbes
Avenue and Bouquet Street is

almost always occupied,” he said.

Waters said that the attacks are
not just “dark street” abductions.
“One of the women was attacked
in the middle of the afternoon, in
broad daylight,” he said.

He urged Pitt students to start
taking more precautions.
“Hopefully students will take extra
precautions, like walking in
groups,” he said. “Also, students
should report any suspicious
activity that they see.

Ricci said that there are three
suspects. “All three were black
males in their 20’s,” he said. “One
is approximately 5 feet 10 inches,
wears glasses, has short hair and
is of medium to heavy build.
Another is approximately 6 feet 2
inches, of thin build, and short
hair.” He said that the third suspect
was similar in build to the first,
but between 5 feet 10 inches and
6 feet 1 inch. I

Credit — no entry?
Posvar says ROTC apart, but schools accept credits for graduation

By Scot Ross and .
Jennifer Calabrese '
The Pitt News

Even though Pitt President Wesley Posvar
separated the Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps as a “voluntary organization” not
under the auspices of the university anti-
discrimination policy, credits from the
military science department can count
toward degrees in both the Schools of
Engineering and Nursing.

According to Larry Shuman, associate
dean of academic affairs of the School of
Engineering, students taking ROTC classes
are permitted to apply three of these
credits as either non—technical or free
elective requirements. As well a
spokesperson from the School of Nursing
said that ROTC courses can count up to

nine elective credits for graduation;

In compliance with the contract signed
between Pitt and the armed forces in 1965,
a Department of Military Science was
created and adjunct professor status was
granted to several officers, who in turn
teach the military science courses.

Upon completion of the second level
military science class, cadets may be
contracted by the military. In this instance,
they are required to actively participate in
the armed forces. Before moving on to the
third year of training, cadets must sign a
document, in which among other items,
they must admit if they are a homosexual.

.“If you openly admit you are a
homosexual it is a disqualifier and you
cannot move on to the advanced course,”
said ROTC Captain Raymond Horoho in a
February interview with The Pitt News.

Heidi Rae White/T he Pitt News
Dr. Dennis Donham is a candidate to become the new vice—president of Student Affairs.

While only commissioned cadets receive
scholarship money from the government,
Pitt maintains that the third and fourth
year military science courses are open to
everyone. ’

Posvar responded to the ROTC’s
apparent policy contradiction with the
university’s anti-discrimination policy on

the basis of sexual orientation, and said.

that, “We shall insist that credit classes be
open to everyone.” Posvar said at the time
he was unsure if there were any ROTC
courses that count toward a Pitt degree.
He was unavailable for further comment
about ROTC being separate from the
university in light of the military science
credits counting in the nursing and
engineering schools.

Though these courses are open to
everyone, there are currently only two

purpose and for one purpose only: so that

Geoghagan said most students are
unwilling to take ROTC classes without
contracting with the armed forces, because
they would not receive any reward for
their efforts.

‘Survival is the name of game for Pitt '5 newest club

By Amy DiMarco
For The Pitt News

The Survival Club, one of Pitt’s

T newest student—run organizations,
has something to offer those who
are motivated to do something a

;. little more physically demanding

on weekends, besides studying.

The club’s main activity is
playing simulated war games on
Saturday or Sunday mornings.

“It’s just like real war—- there’s
no calling timeout,” said the club’s
vice president, Ron Ruch.

Since Pitt’s campus. does not
have the right setting necessary’
to play these games, the club

I‘ plays at one of the area ﬁelds

designed for this purpose. Fields
are located in Wexford and
McKeesport, but club members
play mostoften at a field in Butler
because it most resembles a real
war field. Complete with woods,
fields, trenches, gullies and
valleys, it is conducive to the
execution of the best war tactics.

Started by club president Bob
Paiani and Ruch back in January,

the group was approved in
February. Paiani and Ruch
publicized the new organization
by setting up a display in the
Concourse of the William Pitt
Union and by posting signs.

According to Paiani, about _70
percent of the initial 40 members
were friends of theirs.
Membership has grown in the
last few months to about 1 13, but
“sad to say, only about 13 of them
are girls. We are definitely looking
to up our female membership,”
said Paiani. «

Players claim that the game,
although aggressive in nature, is
actually quite relaxing.

“It’s a different experience. I
go with friends a lot, too,” said
sophomore member ‘Robert
Velarde, who has been playing
for about three years.

Members are not required to
buy their own equipment, since
the ﬁeld rents out all the necessary
items: guns, pellets and safety
goggles. Helmets and camouﬂage
clothing are optional, but wea ring
them makes the game “so much

more realistic,” according to
Paiani. The mineral-oil gelatin
capsules shot from a carbon-
dioxide—pressured gun are non—
toxic, non—staining and
environmentally safe. Provided
that the players. are wearing their
protective equipment, “paintball
is one of the safest sports. Only
about six injuries out of 1,000
[games] occur, as opposed to 500
out ofevery 1,000 joggers getting

,injured,” said Paiani.

_ Despite the game’s safeness,
the club president and vice
president must sign a waiver at
the field stating that any injuries
that occur are not the university’s
responsibility.
they go on any hunts, every
member signs a general
agreement saying that the club is
not responsible in the event of an
injury. Anyinjuries that do occur
due to faults in the playing field
or the rented equipment are
covered by field insurance, which
is included in the equipment-
rental fee. I

In turn, before

half an hour to 45 minutes, with
the club usually playing for a
total of five hours per trip. The
field provides each team with an
unbiased official who helps it
prepare a war strategy and deal
with any emergency situations
that should arise. About 15
members are randomly assigned
to each team.

There are several variations. of
these games. In “Survival,” the
one most often played by the
Club, the goal is to shoot
individuals from the opposing
team without being shot. A team
wins when all members of the
opposing team have been shot.

“Capture the Flag” employs
more of a cooperative effort, with
each team trying to steal the
other team’s flag. The winner is
the team who successfully.

captures another flag before all
of its own members get shot.

If funds permit, some games
can be played in which each
warrior gets his or her own radio
to make inter-team
communication part of the
strategy. Extra guns are also
available so the players needn’t
take time out,.to reload their
weapons when their ammunition
runs out.

Some games are played with a 0

different scoring system in which
points are obtained with each
successful kill and deducted for
missed targets. However, with
so many players, it would be
difficult for Pitt’s club to use this
system, according to Paiani.

ROTC

from the College of Arts and
Sciences; however, the policy was
altered during the Vietnam
Conflict when the Faculty of the
College of Arts and Sciences voted
to eliminate the credit. Presently,
no credits are given towards
graduation in CAS, but grades
earned in ROTC classes are,
calculated into a student's grade
point average.

Geoghagan said that he thinks
the Department of Defense will
someday change its policy
towards homosexuals.

“I don’t care if a person’s pink,
purple or they like animals. I
don’t really care. And that really
down deep is the Army’s [feeling],
it just doesn't make any difference.
However, this has been the rule
for as long as I can remember,”
he said.

“Eventually they will change. It

Although the members do not
have to pay club dues, each
player is responsible for his or
her own rentals and
transportation to and from the
field. Paiani and Ruch hope that
the $25 to $30 cost of rentals can
be cut in half for members after
allocations are received and funds
are raised. Currently,
membership is open, but after
funds are acquired, interested
students will have to get a club
member to sign them up.

In the future, Paiani and Ruch

hope to make action—pursuit ,

games a more popular_ pastime
at Pitt, incorporating them into
intra-fraternity competitions,
various social events and even
having different schools or

According to Robert Gallagher,
the Student Affairs representative
on the committee, “[Donham] is
being given serious consideration.
He is a very respected person on
campus.”

Gallagher said that the
committee expects to make a
decision by the first of July.

It was during the 1960s, when
Donham was an undergraduate
at Southern Illinois University,
that he decided on a career in
which he could help students
with their education. While he
was an undergraduate, there were
many anti-war, civil—rights and
freedom-of—speech protests at
SIU. 1 Many students were
disillusioned with society and
were dropping out of school.

“I was very concerned about
some friends of mine who were
leaving school for bad reasons.
The dean of education
encouraged them to continue the
education By the time I

graduated, I was pretty sure I
wanted to be part of that kind of
program. Iwanted to keep people
involved in their education. I, was
very idealistic,” he said.

After receiving his bachelor’s
degree in history, he went to
work as assistant to the dean at
SIU.

country. He lived in the
mountains of the Himalayas
where there was only one road,
overcrowded buses which broke
down often and water that was
so unsanitary it was “lethal.” He
was also suspected to be a CIA

different from himself. He also
gained a sympathy for the
underdog.

After returning from Nepal in
1977, Donham served as vice
president of the University of
Maine for three years.

Donham came to Pitt and was

needs] as soon as possible.”

—Dr. Dennis Donham

vice president of Student
Affairs in May 1980. '

“Many things attracted
me to Pitt, especially
because it reminded me
of home,” he said. He
also was impressed by

him that he had made the
right career decision.

“You must be sensitive to the
issues of the students and
understand what’s important to
them,” he said.

Donham returned to school to
obtain his doctorate in student
personnel. For his dissertation,
he went to Nepal to do research
on financial aid. Donham
encountered many hardships in

agent and was followed by the
police for three weeks.

He said, “I was able to test
myself physically and mentally.
It helped me more than anything.
I thought I could do anything I
would ever want to do because
of my ‘experience in Nepal.”

culture, Donham became more

the diversity of the people
at Pitt. “The University of
Pittsburgh is unique in having
the Nationality Rooms. lt’s the
first thing I noticed — that the
different cultures could express
themselves,” Donham said.

He also remarked on the
acceptance he has found here.
He said, “One can find friendship
and affiliation, not just at Pitt, but
in the whole town.” ,

As vice president of Student

to accomplish

Affairs, Donham works to
improve undergraduate
education, residence halls and
student life. He is also responsible
for fulfilling the needs.of the
students, which mostly include
tuition, security and housing.

He said, “We have to find ways
[the student’s
needs], as soon as possible.”

Donham feels that right now
the university is going through a
reflective period in which it is.
looking for ways to improve
student life.

“When students tell us their
needs are changing, we’ll change
what’s out there for them. We are
advocates for students and a
liaison for them so that they are
not the lowest priority,” he said.

He also explained that a variety
of programs is necessary to
develop students into leaders and
to give students a chance to test
their ideas. It is also important for
new groups to get in the system
quickly and easily, he said.

Ready, I breathe  tum /eey

At a time when drunken drivers pose ominous safety
risks to sober drivers, a new technology to eliminate those
risks is coming: the Guardian Interlock system.

The system, comprised of a breathalyzer connected to
a motor vehicle’s electrical system, requires the driver to
blow into the system and pass a pre-set level for blood-

A alcohol concentration, usually about 0.02 percent, before

the car will start. (The driver—intoxication level for Penn-
sylvania drivers is 0.10 percent.) That may seem like too
low a level, but then again, these are convicted drunken
drivers. A broader use of the device should probably
require a blood-alcohol level closer to the 0.10 level.
The device requires the user to give a “breath pass-
word,” followed by a sequence of short and long breaths
that activate the system. The “backseat driver” would play
v.seco_‘nd" fiddle to this device]  , l f ’
Installation of the system is on a voluntary basis. As an

- incentive, participants -—-— usually first-time offenders in

druvnken-driving cases —’ receive only a one—month
license suspension, as opposed to six months, followed
by the installation of the Guardian Interlock system for
varying time periods. The device would allow the volun-
teer to prove to the'court or a probation officer ahead of
time that he will not attempt to drink and drive again.
However, there are problems, such as deciding who will
bear the cost of the device and its installation. It costs
participants $48 to $54 per month to have the system
installed in their vehicles. »

Another problem is that the use of mouthwash can

make the device fail on the first try. Also, there is the

‘ possibility of the driver push-starting the car. However,

the newest devices require the driver to give follow-up
breath tests, or the vehicle’s horn will blow.

But the main question is whether or not installation of
the device should be mandatory for all drunken drivers.
Perhaps it would be wrong to require first- and possibly
second-time offenders to use the device. However, a case
can be made for the system’s use among chronic offend-
ers, not to mention medically proven alcoholics.

After all, if seat belts are mandatory under Pennsylvania
state law — a law designed to protect safe drivers from
reckless drivers — then why shouldn’t mandatory breath
tests be used to protect the lives of innocent drivers who
are subjected to the recklessness of drunken drivers?

Drunken drivers kill people. just as many argue that
there should be background checks to prevent hardened
criminals or murderers from purchasing handguns, so
should there be a device to prevent drunken drivers from
killing people with their automobiles.

This system is not depriving drivers of transportation;
they can always call a cab — which should be their first
option anyway. The only thing that the device deprives
drunken drivers of is time in prison for drunken driving
or, at worst, vehicular homicide-.

Qmo ‘Hi

This past weekend in Forbes
Quadrangle, myself and mem-
bers of Tower C [Resident Stu-
dent Association] had a booth at
the 12th annual Hand—in-Hand
festival. At first, when I volun-
teered my services for the day, I
was a bit optimistic due only to
the fact that it was run by stu-
dents, and only students. I have
never been involved in this Pitt
ritual, so I took the chance and
decided to go for it. Boy, was I
surprised.

This was probably the most‘

successfully run function that I
have been at in my two years
here at Pitt. There [were] plenty
of people around to help you or
give you whatever you needed.
These facilitators» were always
around when you needed them
the most. Also, when the men-
tally/physically [handicapped]
children came to our booth to
throw a pie at our faces, the one-
on-one [who] goes with the child
for the entire day was always
there toencourage and support
that person — all just to make the
kids [who] attended happy. and
very content. And I know for a
fact that everyone did his or her
job to their fullest because this
student-run activity was the best
it could have been.
Everywhere you looked,
whether 10 a.m., when it started,
or 4 p.m., when it ended —— all
you saw were smiling faces of
children who haven’t quite had
all the advantages that you or I
have had and sometimes take for
granted. I think that the title of
the festival, “Put a Little Love in
Your Heart,” said it all. Everyone
who helped make all the 400
children feel so happy and ac-
cepted like they never have [felt]
before did what it took. All the
hours, all the blankets with ﬂashy
signs, all the advertising and
planning, all the commitment,
and all the love paid off because
everyone [worked] together. As
told to me by a young boy named
Josh: “You made my day the
best." Believe me, Josh, I am
grateful that we can provide such
an event and also grateful that I
was part of such a “class act” that
the students of the University of

Gays in the ROTC

It is regrettable that the univer-
sity’s anti—dis<:rimination policy
does not apply to ‘outside’ or-
ganizations such as [the Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps]. But it is
simply inexcusable for President
Wesley Posvar to suggest that
ROTC does not, in fact, discrimi-
nate against gay and lesbian stu-
dents. According to The Pitt
News (April 10, 1990), Posvar

Letters

said, “I don’tsee how you can say
that students are being discrimi-
nated against. ROTC is a volun-
tary organization. Nobody is
required to enroll in the ROTC.‘

This reasoning is absurd.“ The

University of Pittsburgh, after all,

is a voluntary organization.
Nobody is required to enroll at
Pitt. Does Posvar think that if Pitt
were to exclude students because
of their race, religion or sexual
orientation, this would not con-
stitute discrimination against
them?

The simple fact is that Pitt’s
ROTC chapter does not allow
gay and lesbian students. to par-
ticipate in its third- and fourth-
year programs simply because
they are gay and lesbian stu-
dents. This is a serious form of
discrimination, and many people
justifiably find it objectionable. If
President Posvar believes that this
discrimination is morally accept-
able, he is certainly entitled to his
opinion. But it is offensive for
him, particularly as a representa-
tive of the entire university com-
munity, to deny that it is discrimi-
nation. He owes us an apology.

Twisted logic

Jeff T atusko’s suggestion to cur-

tail violence during the Grey-

hound strike is inane [“A writer's
notes on currentgevents," April 2].
Using his logic, one could sug-
gest that Pitt randomly expel 10
students for each item found in
the campus police blotter. The
violence during this strike has
been something to take seriously.

The emphasis should be on find- I

ing the criminals who may or
may not be strikers. Mr. Tatusko,
tbinle before you write. It is easy
to generalize, but these are real
people who are both on the
picket lines and being injured.
This situation cannot be helped
by il1—conceived, off- hand com-
ments.

From Cold War to Trade War

From the end of the Cold War,
estimated to have ended in 1962,
the world has become progres-
sively better — and worse. The
bi-polar relationship between the
United States and the Soviet
Union has had its ups and downs
since the Kennedy administra-
tion (nothing as grave as the
Cuban Missile Crisis of October
'62), but now the Soviets are
facing a more than plausible
breakup of their Union. This and
Gorbachev’s glasnost, in Amer-
ica’s eyes, could possibly be the
beginning of the end of Ronald
Reagan’s “Evil Empire” terminol-
ogy once and for all. That in itself
brings long-awaited sighs of re-
lief from many peoples of the
world, and some may even smile,
but where on earth will Ameri-
cans turn their views of aggres-
sion now? The answer has actu-
ally been forming for quite some
time, and the island of America’s
future hostility is roughly the size
of California and lies just off its
Pacific coast. Any more hints?

Japan’s population of 125 mil-
lion has been the recipient of
America’s “_Japan—bashing” for

quite a long time, with its roots -

reaching even further than World
War 11. And the Japanese, in the
eyes of some Americans, are
dangerously close to taking over
our country and miniaturizing
everything in sight. Grounds for
that conviction are ridiculous,
considering that all foreign-
owned firms in the United States
constitute less than 5 percent of
the American work force — a
percentage far too small to be
considered “taking over.” But a
problem that does arise is the fact
that the United States has $600

billion of unpaid loans from the
Japanese. If something drastic
were to hit Tokyo, such as a large
earthquake, the Japanese econ-
omy, as well as ours, would get
some overwhelming damage.
The “Buy America First” and
“Made only in the U.S.A.” cam-
paigns of the late ’80s were good
ideas but seemed to spark more
Japan—bashing than was really

 

Jason
Billings

appropriate. What most people
in our country need to concen-
trate on is that the Japanese are
people (and capitalists), too. They
tend to work longer hours than
us, give up vacation time if the
company needs workers for
overtime and shy away from
unions — those messy beasts
that we put up with. Look at one
example of the great American
system: Greyhound vs. its un-
ions. Striking workers are shoot-
ing cab drivers and busloads of
people with guns and arrows,
just for a bloody raise. The Japa-
nese look at our good examples
and simply shake their heads
and think, “stupid American ter-
rorists.”

I think that our aggression
toward Japan is deﬁnitely misdi-
rected; it can only take what we
are willing to give it. We need to
turn off our Sony televisions and
move ourselves out of our Ko-
rean-made La-Z—Boys if we really
want to kick the worldwide stere-
otyping of our ways of life. A lot
of foreigners see us as lazy work-
ers, hell-bent on reaching the
weekends and doing just what is
absolutely necessary during the
working week to get by. And the
funny thing is that in many cases,
they’re right. Our aggression
should be aimed at ourselves,
not at Japan.

Tokyo’s recent stock- market
crash sent chills down investors’
spines and inspired some Ameri-
cans to think that the Japanese
businessman isn’t as infallible as
some would care to believe. But
if our aggression doesn’t end
soon, it will most definitely esca-
late into something that none of
us would like to see.

For years now, both countries
have been close allies and have
been economically linked to-
gether. But now, since the Soviet
bear is gradually receding back
into its cave and licking its
wounds, the Rising Sun seems to
be picking up the slack from
America’s “anti-anything” views.
We’re growing too close to be-
coming totally anti-Japanese, and
if our views continue to clash, a
full- ﬂedged trade war, first be-
tween the United States and
Japan, and then possibly with the

Soviet Union, will be raging on,

our home turf within the next 10
years.

Some predictions for next semester

With the winter term gradually
winding down to an end, I have
found myself in a rather uncer-
tain position. Because of costs, I
may have to transfer out of Pitt
for a few years. I know my many
fans would be traumatized if this
travesty indeed occurs, but fear
not! I will always be here in spirit,
if not in print.

I thought I’d write out my fall-
term columns now, just in case.
This requires a little guesswork
on my part, but I’ve got a grip on
the pulse of Pitt, and I think-I can
do the job.

So, without further ado, I pres-
ent my predictions for the hottest
news stories for the 1990-91
school year at the University of
Pittsburgh. _

10. Aug. 27, 1990 — Engineer-
ing students are shocked to learn
the program now requires two
years mandatory study of an East
Asian language.

9. Sept. 13, 1990 —— Minor
confusion broke out at the fresh-
man-activities orientation fair
when it was discovered that both
the Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps and the Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Alliance were using the
same slogan. The situation was
resolved without incident.

8. Sept. 29, 1990 —— A campus
police officer reported that his
hat, badge, wallet and car myste-
riously disappeared after he was

. approached by a man asking for

a pen.

7. Oct. 18, 1990 — In a tragic
homecoming matchup turned
sour, a riot ensued after Pitt upset
the Fighting Scottish. The statue
of Mike Gottfried that had been
erected on the 50-yard line ear-
lier this season was destroyed in

 

Wevchsler

the ruckus. Two students and
one Golden Panther were re-
ported missing.

6. Nov. 7, 1990 — Student
Government Board candidate
Warren Q. Addlethrop III wins
the presidential race in a land-
slide election. Addlethrop prom-
ised in his campaign to acquire
Batman for the Hillman Library
collection and to extend the
choice-dollars program to include
C.J. Bamey’s.

5. Dec. 2, 1990 — A) In a
surprise move to increase uni-

versity revenue, Roy Rogers

Restaurant is evicted from the
basement of the Cathedral of
Learning. It is replaced by a similar
fast-food establishment,
“Wes1ey’s.”

B) Proposition 48 amended!
Athletes need only spell their
own team's names.

4. Jan. 1, 1991 —-A) Pitt tramples
Duquesne to take the national
title!

B) Pitt Program Council ad-
viser, Lester Misurauble, an-
nounces the 1991 spring-break
Trip will be to Passaic, N.J.

3. Feb. 6. 1991 —— Peace re-
turns, as the 19-day siege of the
new Ravsop student dormito-
ries, erected on the old Schenley
Plaza, ends. Kay Jatz, spokes-
man for the group of students
calling themselves “The Com-
mutants,” who led the sit-down
resistance, said an agreement was
reached when the university ad-
ministration agreed to build a
parking garage beneath the new
dorms.

2. March 11, 1991 — A Liquor
Control Board raid of Theta Nu
Gamma recovered the large neon
rendition of the Cathedral of
Learning and a panther that for-
merly hung in the William Pitt
Union.

1. April 1, 1991- The new
University Shop sells official
Panther Condoms.

Homelessness:
Zoning is the culprit

Mosf people know that homelessness is a big problem in the
United States. What most people are probably not aware of is
that local governments are a big cause of homelessness.

Zoning is one of the biggest causes of homelessness in the
United States. This policy, which is administered by local
governments, states what property owners can and cannot do
with their land. Zoning laws often prevent low-cost housing
from being built. ’

A study was conducted by Professor Bernard Frieden of
M.l.T. He studied six housing projects in or near San Francisco.
In each of the six cases, developers were planning to build
between several hundred and a few thousand units of low- to
middle-income housing. In every case, there were objections
by nearby homeowners. They put tremendous pressure on the
local government to block the developments. The government
imposed all sorts of long regulatory delays and huge legal fees
on the developers. In the end, the housing that did get built was
less dense (i.e., fewer units of housing per acre) and much
more expensive.

Last summer, an apartment owner on my street wanted to
add some units to his building, but the government would not
permit him to do so.

A recent news program
described a developer in
California who was plan-
ning to build over 1,000
units of housing on several
hundred acres of land.
Nearby residents objected.
They reminded the devel-
oper of a local zoning law
which would permit only
14 units of housing to be
built on that land.

Zoning serves only one
purpose: It prevents what
some people consider to
be “undesirable develop-
ment.” Those who already own homes often object to any new
construction near their homes. These people are often in favor
of zoning laws.

 

Daniel
Alman

A free market exempt from government interference will -

provide a supply wherever there is a demand. Zoning laws
interfere in the marketplace and prevent the supply of low-cost
housing from meeting the demand.

The price of any commodity is related to the supply. If the
supply is scarce, then the price will be high. Zoning limits the
supply of housing, thus causing prices to rise and homeless-
ness to increase. ’

In most areas of the country, the local zoning laws would
prevent me from purchasing an empty lot and building low-
cost housing on it, even if I wanted to do so. Simply put, in most
areas of the country, there is a shortage of low-cost housing
because it is against the law to build it.

The owner. of a piece of land should be free to build on it
however he wants. Zoning laws take away this freedom. Our
founding fathers were against zoning laws. Before 1915, there
wasn’t a single zoning law anywhere in the United States.

Today Houston, Texas is the only major city in the United
States that does not have zoning. A recent study by CATO
Institute, a private think tank in Washington, D.C., described
the housing market in Houston. There is a very large supply of
low-cost housing in Houston. Landlords are desperate to attract
tenants and keep their prices down very low. It is a common
practice for landlords to offer two months’ free rent when a
one-year lease is signed.

An article in the May 1990 issue of Reason magazine also
described the housing market in Houston. “In 1982, in the teeth
of the recession, the Houston area built 60,000 new homes —
one of every 15 new units in the country. Despite enormous
population growth, rental vacancies have remained above 15
percent for more than a decade, Condominiums and starter
homes still [in 1990] sell for $30,000 (that’s the asking price, not
the down payment), and homelessness has been extremely
low. ...” V 4

That same article described attempts in San Diego to reduce
the zoning restrictions in that city. After one of the zoning laws
was changed to allow more freedom for developers, S65 low-
cost housing units were created, and plans have been drawn
up for 1,500 more. That was just one zoning law that was
changed in San Diego. Abolishing all of San Diego's zoning
laws would lead to the creation of even more low-cost housing
in that city.

Eliminating all the zoning laws in every city would lead to the
creation of an abundant supply of low-cost housing throughout
the entire nation. I wonder "what impact that would have on

Pitt introduced new head

The university needed to

better way to do that than

was to recreate a positive

25-game losing streak ends for baseball te

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

After failing in their previous
25 Big East contests, the Panther’s
baseball team squeaked by the
Boston College Eagles Monday
with a 3-2 victory at Trees Field.

With the score knotted at two
in the bottom of the eighth, Chris
Cioffi clanked a two-out double
that scored Blane Vucci for the
winning run. The victory was the
first conference win in two
seasons for the Panthers. B.C. i
had beaten Pitt in both endsof a
double header on Sunday.

“Fred Iriti pitched a three hitter,”
said Lewis. “Too bad two of them
were solo home runs, but he did
keep us in there.”

Iriti pitched eight innings,
improving his record to 2-1 and
dropping his earned run average
to 3.65. Iriti has been named the
Big East Pitcher of the Week for
his performance.Tim Gralewski

The Univer_s_ity of Pittsburgh rowing club
proved that last week's oil spill on the
Allegheny River did not hinder their’
performances at the John Hopkins Invitational
at Baltimore's Inner Harbor last Saturday.

Because of the oil spill, the members of the
rowing club were unable to practice during
the first week of April, but they were able to
come home on Sunday with three gold
medals under their belts.

Rowing against the Panthers last weekend
were the Stockton State College Ospreys,
John Hopkins University, the La Salle
University Explorers, the George Washington
University Colonials, the George Mason
University Patriots, the Bucknell University

: Bison, the Carnegie Mellon University T artans,
the Duquesne University Dukes, the Loyola

The format for the invitational consisted of
qualifying heats of four racing lanes with
three heats. For the ﬁnals, the fastest boat
from each qualifying heat would race the
boat with the second— best qualifying time
during the heat. A _

The rowing club started out the competition
with the men’s varsity lightweight boat racing
the lightweight boat from Stockton State
College. The Panthers took both the Ospreys
and the gold medal with ease.

Rowing in the Panthers’ boat were starting
from stroke (the rower sitting closest to the
coxswain): Bob Falk (the club’s president),
Dennis Smarta, Eric Howard, Mike O'Connor
and coxswain Betty Weingartner.

During the Panthers’ second heat, the
women’s novice boats, both of Pitt's boats
qualified for the ﬁnals. Of the two Pitt boats,

Lady Panther recruits shoul

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Just because the women’s swimming
team has won the Big East championship
every year since Pitt joined the conference,
do you think Coach David Belowich is
content with what he has? No way.

Every year Belowich wins the
conference, and every year he improves
the Lady Panthers even more with a good
recruiting class. As usual, Belowich is
cautious about predicting another Big East
championshi p for next year, which would
make nine straight, but a solid team is
secured by his returning veterans and his
new class.

“We return most of the team, and with
the freshmen filling some of the spots,
we’re going to be all right. I'm excited
already," said Belowich. '

Here is a look at Belowich’s recruiting
class for the 1990-91 season:

Candy Burke —- An individual—medley
swimmer from Baldwin, Pa., Burke is a
good example of the student/athlete. Burke
will enter Pitt with a Provost's Scholarship,
in- addition to athletic aid.

"‘-noo«csqsus""—*"."'
.

“We pride ourselves on being a good
academic program and Candy fits right in
with that. She’ll be a real asset to our
program,” said Belowich.

Belowich is probably even more excited
about what Burke can do in the pool. As
an individual—medley swimmer, she will
complement established Pitt swimmers
Laura—Lee Sullivan, Karin Masal and Suzi
McManus in that event. The individual
medley event combines the butterfly,
breaststroke, backstroke and freestyle.

“The other girls have a specialty stroke
and aren’t true IMers. You must have four
good strokes for this event; you can’t
have a weak stroke. Candy has four good
strokes,” said Belowich.

Jennifer Burns — A backstroker and
freestylist from Lowell, Mass., Burns will
fill a vacant spot in the Lady Panther
lineup.

Sandy Albright, a school-record holder
in two events, will be leaving the Pitt
team due to graduation. Burns will join
Trina Thames and Janine Atiyeh as Pitt's
top backstrokers. V ‘ .

Belowich’ saidllurmisfromasvvirnming

program with limited membership; in
fact, she was the only representative
from her club atJunior Nationals. Despite
this, Belowich is confident about her
ability.

“We have to replace some needs from
the graduating students,” said Belowich.
“In backstroke, we’re graduating Albright,
and it’s difficult to replace a school-
record holder. But I think in four years,
when all is said and done, I’ll be‘ saying
the same about Burns. She’s a tremendous
backstroker.”

Margaret McClurg —— McClurg, from
Lakeland, Fla., is a freestylist who will
add versatility to the Lady Panthers.

“She’s as versatile a freestyler as they
come. She does everything from the 50-
yard all the way down to the mile,” said
Belowich. “It will be intriguing from the
standpoint of her versatility. We don't

‘really have a pure sprinter to replace
Laure Walczak, so we'll need her
ﬂexibility. She should make quite an
impact on the team.”

Belowich said that with the addition of

Leopards were scratched from the race. This
meant that the Panthers and the Ospreys
would be racing head to head.

The Panthers took the qualifying heat and
prepared for their final heat, but the river
conditions took a turn for the worse. The

Laura N erone Nerone is a

than her swimming times.

“She has tremendous people skills. She “

a team is often just as important as the top
performers. She may not get all the first
places, but she will have a tremendous
impact on the team,” said Belowich.

Pitt diving coach Julian Krug is adept at

according to Belowich.

“From everything I know, she could be
a really good diver,” said Krug. “Her
background is weak in diving, but anyone-
with that kind of [gymnastics] background
warrants a degree of interest

“Basically, she hasn't been exposed to

Pirates ' front office bad, but no match for Vikings ’ gang

The Minnesota Vikings released
quarterback Tommy Kramer at
his own request on Monday.
Kramer was Minnesota's first-
round draft pick in 1977 and
served the Vikings for 13 years.
Kramer holds team records in
many passing categories and is
second in most of the others.
Those are the facts.

The most disturbing word in
the above paragraph is released.
Kramer wasn’t traded. Kramer
didn’t retire or quit. ‘He was
released.

I think the Vikings’ board of
directors has been hanging
around the front office of the
Pittsburgh Pirates. In the past
few years, both teams have let
talented players leave their
respective organizations and
received little or nothing in return.

The Pirates’ idiocy started with
the acquisition of Rey Quinones.
The Bucs weren't wrong in getting
him from the Seattle Mariners in
a trade for Mike Dunne; that was
a good move. But when
Quinones went sour for the

Pirates, they just let him go. They
didn’t even attempt to trade him.
They could have at least tried to
get something. Anything.

Next, the Pirates traded Glenn

 

Wilson to the Houston Astros for
Billy Hatcher. Wilson was one of
the few bright spots for the Bucs
last year. He displayed a pleasant
mix of power and consistency -
not a good enough combination
for the second—to-last-place Pirates
of a year ago. Hatcher came in,

mainly to lead off and let Barry ~

Bonds get more RBIs, and
basically stunk for the Pirates.

As if the Wilson-for-Hatcher
trade wasn’t bad enough, Hatcher
gets traded to the Cincinnati Reds
before this season for two
unheralded players. So basically,
Glenn Wilson turned into two
unheard-ofs.

But don’t fret, Pirate fans. The
Vikings’ release of Kramer is
much worse.

Three seasons ago, the
Minnesota Vikings were a
dropped pass away from the
Super Bowl. Wade Wilson threw
a fourth-down pass into the hands
of Darrin Nelson at the goal line
with less than a minute remaining
against the Washington Redskins
in the NFC Championship game.
It was a difficult but catchable
pass that Nelson missed.

Where was Kramer through all
this? “Tommy Gun" was on the
sidelines, looking on. Actually,
Kramer had been on the sidelines
throughout much of that 1987
season. Repeated injuries to his
shoulder and neck gave Wilson

his chance.
Withthischance, Wilsondearly
emerged as the better

quarterback, especially in the
playoffs. Kramerstaited thewild-
card game, but once again was
injured That’s when Wilson took
off. That’s when Wilson started
his emergence as a million—dollar
quarterback Wilson guided an
absolute shredding of the Saints
in that wild-card game. Wilson
continued his playoff victory

‘ march with an impressive outing

against the San Francisco 49ers.
Wilson and Anthony Carter
teamed up to make a mockery of
the 49er secondary. Wilson was
then one step away from the
Super Bowl- He and the Viking
offensive line had a sub-par
performance and still almost beat
the Redskins. But Nelson’s bad
luck meant a 17-10 defeat.
Despite them not making the
big show, all of a siidden Wilson
was a hero and a great
quarterback. Kramer didn’t have
a chance against Wilson now.
Viking fans wanted Wilson, and

with good reason. The Vikings
had to go with Wilson for 1988;
he proved he was better.

But what to do with Kramer?
Maybe his injuries made him a
question mark to compete with
Wilson for the 1988 starting-
quarterback job, but everyone at
the time seemed to have forgotten
that Kramer was the top-rated
passer in the NFC for the 1986
season.

Kramer's stock was still high.
The Vikings should have traded
him then. Right after that 1987
season, when Kramer still could
have been a quality starter for a
football team, the Vikes should
have said goodbye. Sending a
top quarterback to the right team
could bring in valuable riches.
The Vikings had some holes to
fill. Their offensive line was
suspect; their linebacking crew
needed depth, and another
running back wouldn't have hurt.

Kramer could have brought in 8

some quality players for those
positions, and there was a long
list of teams that needed a good
quarterback. LA Raiders, Detroit,
Dallas, Kansas City, Pittsburgh,
Indianapolis, etc. 

But what did the Vikings do?
They decided to let Kramer and
Wilson fight it out for the starting
spot. All that was accomplished
was endless bickering of both
quarterbacks: “I can’t start with a
gun to my head.” “It’s tough to
play knowing that one mistake
and I’m on the bench.”

The Vikings made the playoffs
again in the 1988 season, but
were destroyed by the 49ers, the
same team they destroyed one
year ago. What if the Vikings had
traded Kramer for some quality
players to fill,some holes? What
if, what if, what if  ?

People can “what if" all they
want, but one thing remains clear:
Kramer was a quality quarterback
who could have brought some
needed players to the Vikings.
Kramer was released on Monday.

Take heart, Pirate fans.

Hancock Bowl victory over Texas
A&M —— Hackett’s first game at
Pitt and his first victory.

The first half of the season was
important because it gave Hackett
notoriety for creating a
quarterback in freshman Alex Van
Pelt, who also rose ‘to national
fame for coolly guiding Pitt to an
early 5-0-1 record.

This was Hackett’s rise to power
in Pitt football. It was the
convincing factor for Pitt to hire
him after Gottfried’s dismissal.

Gottfried’s name was only
mentioned once during the
meeting -—— near the end of the
film. Pitt did not want to discuss
the negative, and Gottfried’s era
was negative.

In fact, one would not know
Gottfried was coach last year by
watching the film. The only Pitt
coach who appeared in the ﬁlm
was Hackett. He spoke about the
comeback tie against West
Virginia. The main point made by
the film about that amazing game
was Van Pelt regaining his

Hackett’s calls.

The highlights of the movie
were the West Virginia game and
the John Hancock Bowl. The
crowd cheered for both.

Everything was upbeat. Only
the positive was mentioned. Pitt’s
athletic department feels the

program is headed in a positive

direction.

It should feel that way. It has
the perfect man for the job — a
man from the National Football
League who stresses learning in
the classroom and fundamentals
on the field.

Hackett knows what it takes
for a player to be successful at the
highest level. He is an offensive

a genius. He has coached the

offenses of Super Bowl
champions and . national

champions. He has worked with

players like Joe Montana,
Herschel Walker, Tony Dorsett
and Jerry Rice. He also worked
with quarterbacks Danny White
and Brian Sipe at the professional
level. He coached USC’s Vince
Evans when he was the 1977
Rose Bowl’s Most Valuable Player.

Hackett said that for Pitt football
to be successful, he needs the
support of the whole university
—— from the Golden Panthers to
the players to the students
cheering at the games. But for
him to receive that support, he
must work with all levels of the
university, so that each individual
who is involved with Pitt football
can relate to his and the
university’s goals.

ESPN coverage of major league baseball up to opening day standards

It might have started a week
late, but baseball season ﬁnally
had its opening day on Monday,
and it was an opening day to
remember.

The biggest highlight of the
day might have been the start of
ESPN’s season—long coverage. If
you live in a dorm, I suggest you
find a friend with an apartment
and pay him a visit.

As a journalist, I felt it was my
obligation to watch the majority
of ESPN’s tripleheader coverage
while lying on my bed in a
catatonic state, purely for
evaluation purposes.

The ﬁrst game of the day
featured the surprise team of 1989
—— the Baltimore Orioles —
against Bojackson and the Kansas
City Royals. It was only fitting
that the first game ever on ESPN

’Went 11 innings. The Orioles

pulled out a 7-6 victory,
highlighted by Sam Horn’s two
home runs in a game that he had
dedicated to his sick mother.

At the conclusion of the first
game, we were shown the

conclusion of the game between ’

the Padres and the Dodgers. After
constant reminders that Bruce

Hurst had a no-hitter going

through six innings, he naturally
gave up a hit to the first batter
shown to the television audience.

Announcer Chris Berman, who
might have felt some
embarrassment for hyping up the
potential no-hitter, quickly
redeemed ESPN when he _told
the viewers that as far as they’re
concerned, he has givenup a hit
to every batter thathe has faced.

This game, like the first, went
down to the wire. The Dodgers
came back from a 2-0 deficit to
win, a victory highlighted by
newly acquired Hubie Brooks’
three—run home run in the bottom
of the eighth inning.

ESPN then used the break
between games to show us Sports
Center and its newest show:
Baseball Tonight, complete with
a catchy tune.

The final game of the
tripleheader was between the
defending division champion
Blue Jays and the Rangers, led by
the ageless wonder Nolan Ryan.
Ryan, the all-time strikeout leader,
was still throwing smoke at age
43, pitching five no-hit innings
and picking up his 290111 career

win. The Rangers felt that it was
more important to take Ryan out
after throwing 90 pitches than
having him pursue his sixth career
no-hitter. It was the right choice.
The Rangers lost the no-hitter but

still won the game 4-2.

If Monday’s three games are
any indication of what is to come
on this season on ESPN, it should
be a very exciting one.

They did some things very well,
such as their frequent updates of
other games around the league.
They also kept viewers informed
as, midway through the game,
the lineups were shown on the
screen showing how each batter
had fared on that day.

   
  
 
 
  
  
 

Opening day also had some
other memorable moments. In
Boston, Wade Boggs collected
his 1600th career hit as the Red
Sox beat the Tigers 5-2. A surprise
member of the Red Sox roster
was Bill Buckner, best
remembered by Red Sox fans as
the goat of their 1986 World
Series with the Mets. Buckner,
who admitted he was nervous
about how the Fenway Park
faithful would respond to him,
was pleasantly surprised when
there were many cheers at his
introduction.

In Houston, they celebrated
the 25th anniversary of the
Astrodome, but it was the Reds
who did the celebrating, after
Barry Larkin’s bases—loaded triple
in the 11th inning led to
Cincinnati's 8-4 win. The Reds,
who traditionally play the first
game of every season at home,

were forced to start on the road
for the first time since 1966
because of this year’s lockout.
By this point, you’re probably
asking yourself, “Why isn’t this
guy talking about the Pirates
thrashing the hated New York
Mets?" I figured you already knew
everything about the game. The
question I’m asking myself is:
Why did this whole‘ university
suddenly remember that I'm from
New Jersey? While I will admit
that the Pirates looked tough, I
have to remind you that there are
still another 161 games to go.
This year’s opening day totaled
three extra-inning games, all

decided in 11 innings. The third
was the Cardinals’ 6-5 victory
over the Expos. Willie McGee
was the hero in his first attempt to
rebound from an injury-plagued
season by getting the game—tying
hit in the ninth inning and the
game winner in the 11th.

The Cubs were to have their
first evening home opener ever,
but it was rained out. The first
night game ever at Wrigley Field
was also rained out. The purists
will say that it is a sign from
above that Wrigley Field shouldn’t
have lights. I say itjust happened
to rain on those two nights.

This weekend, the
Panthers will be hosting a
grudge match with the

I CMU Tartans and the

Duquesne Dukes.

“This is a grudge match,”
said Alpern, “because we
all share the same boat
house.”

The race will be held on
Saturday morning from 9
to II on the Allegheny
River. The race will start at
the 51st Street Bridge, and
the ﬁnish line will be at the
16th Street Bridge.

‘It was a great game to watch.
The game was close the whole
way,” said Lewis. “Even after we
got the lead in the eighth, [Boston
College] loaded the bases in the
ninth, but the lead held up, and
we finally got one."

Vucci, a catcher for the
Panthers, scored all three runs
for Pitt Ciofii, a second baseman,
had two mns batted in, the last
being his second game—winner
of the season. Outtielder Kirk
Dornanick had the other RBI.

The Panthers were 0-17 in Big
East play last season and were 0-
8 this year before their victory on
Monday. Pitt's overall record this
year is 4-12.

Afterthe B.C. sweep on Sunday,
Pitt's captain and first baseman,
Matt Bianco, said the Panthers
were having trouble focusing on
winning."

‘We play [to scorel runs, not [to
getl the win. It’s sad to say, but
sometimes it does seem that our
team objective is not always to

' “Everyone is welcome

said Alpern. “You can see
the race from the sidewalk
