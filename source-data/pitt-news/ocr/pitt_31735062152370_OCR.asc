Quarters In Nearby
Hotel Sclienley

The Faculty Club must vacate its
present quarters, January 15, be-
cause of building operations on the
new Presbyterian hospital. This an-
nouncement was made today by the
Board of Governors of the Club.
headed by Dr. Anthony Goldberger,
president. The building will ‘be
razed to make room for the new
hospital structure, shortly after the

removal of the club.

A recommendation to move the
club quarters to an assembly I00!“
in the basement of the Hotel Schen-
ley has been made in a letter ad-

 

‘ dressed to all club members by a

Committee on the Future of the
Club. Members are being asked ,’°°
vote on this proposal and a. deﬁnite
policy will be determined on the
basis of this vote.

Advocate Hotel

In the report of the committee‘,
the quarters as provided by the ho-
tel will include a space 41 feet by
26 feet, which may be converted
into two club rooms. The quarters
have a separate outside entrance
and an inside entrance from the hp-
tel. Luncheon facilities_ are avail-
able for club. members in the din-
ing room of the hotel pro er. The

rice for the quarters wou d be one
hundred and ﬁfty dollars. per
month on a yearl rental basis. All
the facilities of t ~-e hotel would be
available to the members of the

- club.

Commenting on the future of the
organizations, the Board of Govern-
o' in their letters to members 53317:
“ e have been _unable to ﬁnd with-
ii reasonable distance of the cam-
pus and Cathedral any quarters
which.‘- would allow_ us to continue
our present club with 1'00m111Z and
eating facilities. We believe that
the Faculty Club should be_kept ac-
tive auxin the period which must
elapse _ ore we can have rooms
in the Cathedral, and that the_ quar-
tors in the Hotel Schenley will en-
able us to continue our social con-
tact: and group meetings in a place
even more convenient to the major-
ity of members than the present
clubhouse.”

The Committee on the Future of
the Club includes among its mem-
bers the following: Dean Elmer Al-
len Holbrook, of the School of En-
gineering and of the School Of

Constitution F or

After two weeks of investigation

the Men’s Self Governing Associa-
tion or the Men’s Co-operative Coin-
mission, will meet at dinner --next

Wednesday night at Heinz House 

report their ﬁndings. «

The thirty men attending the ﬁrst

meeting, held two weeks ago, were

divided into four committees, name-
ly, general, executive, legislative and

judicial, headed by Emanuel Fish-
kin, Bus. Ad. ’31; Charles Seidle,
Col. ’31; Edward Crowder, Col. ’81;
and Maurice Naumoff, Bus. Ad. .’31.

According to Fishkin, a member
of Student Council and the guiding
spirit of the proposed organization
in its trip through Student.Council,
the suggestions and recommenda-
tions as set forth next week will be
considered by the constitutional
committee and incorporated in the
ﬁnal draft. He said that it is pro-
posed to submit this constitution to
a student referendum of all men un-

dergraduates before the end of the

present semester.

Grad Students Must
File Applications

The December issue of the Uni-
versity Bulletin contains a notice
that should be called to the attention
of all the members of the graduate
school. It is in reference to their
degrees.

The method formerly used -was
the one in which the professors sent
in a list of the eligible candidates
for degrees. This became difficult
as the number of students studying
for degrees increased.

The method now adopted resem-
bles that of the undergraduate
school. Applicants must ﬁle peti-
tions for degrees not later than De-
cember 19. This does not mean that
they will be given degrees, but no
degrees will be ‘given that have not
been petitioned for. ,

Oh! How C oeds Love Sleep!
’ Rest Room Beds Rushed,
Come 01:, Move Over!

 

There's no rush season in Dr.
»Shephard’s rest room—it’s crowded
all the time. In fact, there's al-

ways someone waiting for a bed_as
soon as it’s vacated.
The ﬁrst women’s rest room was

‘V down in State Hall when Dr. Shep-

hard had her office in that building
f in 1920, but when the office was
' moved to Alumni Hall, the adjoin-

ing room was used as a rest room.
The five beds‘were donated by the
Simmons Bed Company about three
ears ago and, it seems, haven’t
ad a moment's rest since.
Monday, Wednesday and Friday
are usually the busiest days, with
the big rush coming at 11 o’clock in
the morning. Most girls are just
resting from strenuous class work,
or perhaps catching up on last
night's lost sleep. The life of a
Pitt coed must be fatiguing for the
fest room seems to be quite popu-
ar.
. Speaking about the medical office
itself, Dr. Shephard remarked’ that
it has been‘ busier this year than
at any other time. In October alone,
there were 615 calls in the office.
Dr. Shephard expects to be espe-
cially rushed this month on account
of the changing weather.

Coeds Debate Topic
Of Current Interest

The Women’s Debaters gave '-their
initial campus. debate December 8,
at a luncheon meetin of Y. W. C.
A. The question which is used by

“Resolved that the several states
should adopt some form of co -
ulsory unemployment insurance,”
is especially interesting new that
there are new phases of the question
developing every day.

It was a. coincident last Monday
that the affirmative of the debate
was upheld by Marie Hocksmuth, a
senior, and Hannah Taimuty, a jun-
ior, while Gladys Pyle, a sophomore
and Marjorie Hanson, a. freshman,
defended the negative.

Next Tuesday, December 16, the
same question will be presented be-
fore the Shriners at a luncheon at
the Win. Penn Hotel with Marie
Hocksmuth, Ed. '31, and Sara‘Jos-
selson, Col. ’32, affirmative and
Louise Linn, Ed. ’32, and Gladys
Pyle, Col. ’33, negative. ‘

The ﬁrst intercollegiate debate is
scheduled for January 22 with Seton
Hill Colle e at Greensburg, Pitt
debating the negative. The policy
of non-decision debates will be fol-
lowed out in inter-collegiate as well
as intra-mural debates.

Festival To Open Donation
.Of Money, Food To Poor

,“Fill your pockets with quarters

beforepyou start for the Yuletide
Festival,” urges the committee as it
adds a new feature to the Christmas
program. “Santa Claus will be
there to receive money for poor fam-
ilies in Pittsb"urgh.’,'
, “Dive into the pantry and bring
up a can of beans or a loaf of bread
to continue the Festival
Friday. Or rummage around the
closet and bring out that coat you
‘lbought three years ago, for the do-
nation box" in Alumni Hall” is a
ﬁnal suggestion. ,

A With the realization that this
Christmas will be a. cheerless occa-
sioii among the many poor families
in Pittsburgh unless those who are
more fortunate do something’ to ‘help
them,.the Woman’s Self—Government
Association, in co-operation with the
Men’s Self-Government Associa-
tion, is sponsoring a Pitt Student
Welfare drive, which will be held
_Thursday and Friday, December 18
and 19. -

Opens With Dance

The drive will begin next Thurs-
day evening at the Yuletide Festi-
val dance in the Hotel Schenley,
where a large Santa Claus and a
chimney will be placed in the ball-
room to receive monetary returns.
Then, on Friday, a large box will
be put in Alumni Hall which will
be a receptacle for canned goods,
toys, clothing, as ‘well as money.
These donations will then be given
over to a charitable organization.

The idea originated at W. S. G. A.
commission meeting held "last Thurs-
day, when the women decided "that
in-~view»of~ the present» economic.dc-
pression, it would be a worthwhile
undertaking to have a charity drive
at the University ‘before the Christ-
mas holidays. The association wished
to extend to Pitt students rather
than a W. S. G. A. movement, so
they asked the aid of the Men’s
Self-Governing Association in put-
ting it over. Then, with the deci-
sion to make the drive a part of the
Yuletide festivities, the two associa-
tions asked the help of the Student
Relations and Yuletide Festival

committees.
Students on the committee in
charge of the drive are: Hermine

Ruoff, Col. ’31; Naomi Ericson, Ed.
’31; Elaine‘. Foraker, Col. ’32; Sara
Josselson, Col. ’32, and Ruth Ham-

Hasten Work
On New Clinic

Med Structure To Be Ready
For Occupancy By March

 

The Falk Clinic, latest addition to
the University medical center, is
taking on ﬁnal shape. The stone-
work on the structure on Fifth ave-

_nue,,is almost ﬁnished. Soon no‘

more "masons will" 'be“8e'e‘n and by
March the building will be ready
for occupancy, according to the su-
perintendent of construction.

In March, Dr. J . Barrett will take
up his duties as director of the clin-
ic. The medical staff is undeter-
mined as yet, but announcement of

the personnel is expected soon. The’

clinic is to be equipped with the
most modern improvements along
medical lines.

The window frames have already
been painted black, offering a strong
contrast to the limestone walls. All
windows are in and are marked for
protection. A twenty-foot extension
is all of the outside that remains in-
completed and this work is progress-
ing rapidly.

All rooms on the second, third,
fourth and ﬁfth floors have been
partitioned and the plasterers have
already begun work.

Wiring in the building is to be
completed after the plasterers have
ﬁnished. At present, a temporary
lighting system is in use. The build-
ing is sealed and is being heated by
a temporary heating system, so that
the cold weather will not interfere
with the progress of the interior. In
January, this temporary system will
give way to a permanent one.

All of the plumbing ‘and heating
pipes are to be well insulated, and
will be concealed by the walls. All
ﬂoors will be of either marble, ter-
razzo, asphalt tile or rubber tile. In
order to eliminate fire risk there will

Can you imagine taking a course
in which it is “the thing” to wear
a. bathing suit to class‘! That doesn't
sound enticing just now, but Helen
Hilsman and Louise Mc_Kain, both
senior zoology majors in the col-
lege, found it was a good idea In
the ﬁeld zoolo y trips they took at
Cold Spring arbor, Long Island,
last summer.

One of the occasions when a bath-
ing suit came in handy was in hunt-
ing for squilla. These animals, a
form of crustacea, live in mud holes
near the. sea. shore, and must be
hunted at low tide, as they ‘are sub-
merged when the , tide is high.
“Sometimes -we'd have to wade in
mud up to our hips to find any,”
Helen said very calmly, just as If
wading in mud was 9. common mat-
ter in the life of a zoology major.
Another exciting thing Helen and
Louise did, was to go dredging forty

fathoms for deep sea life. They
used large nets, thrown over the
side of the boat. In fact, nets were
a very popular article for they al-
ways carried their little “butterﬂy”
nets, too. to catch any insects they
wanted.

For a research problem, Helen and
Louise worked out the life history
of the mud-dauber wasp. Interest-
ing insect, this! It builds its nest
of mud, then lines the nest with
spiders which it has stung and
anaesthe-tized, so that -the larvae
will have fresh food to feed upon
when they hatch. .
The girls were sentto the session
by the Collembola Club scholarship.
Both are members of Quax honora-
ry scientiﬁc fraternity. Helen plans
to do research work in zoology in a
museum oi'w‘university when she
graduates from Pitt, and I_:(.‘L1_lS... in-

Faculty Talk
Series Opens

Collins‘ Discusses Trip To
Find Man’: Origin

 

 

The ﬁrst of a current_series of
faculty lectures was delivered by
Professor Henry Homer Collins, de-
lpartinent of zoology, Wednesday‘,_at
Alumni Hall. Professor Collins
spoke on “Recent Trends. in Bio-
logical Research" in which be dis-
cussed- some of the recent phases
of experimental morphology, the
experimental study of heredity, evo-
lution, emergent evolution, eugenics
and of the expeditions to find the

On the subject of experimental
morphology, Professor Collins men-
tioned the recent experiment in
which the halves of two different
frogs were drafted together to form
a living c,ompos1_te frog. Another
experiment mentioned was that in
which a piece of tissue from the
heart of a chicken has been kept
alive in a laboratory for twelve
years. .

On the subject of experimental
heredity, Professor Collins spoke of
the success of a Texas scientist
who caused 1,000 mutations to ap-
pear in fruit flies. .

Study Mongolian Man

. Speaking/of recent American ex-
peditions to Mongolia to prove the
theory that man's. origin was there,
Professor Collins said they proved
rather disappointing, but that dis-
coveries? of the Peking man have
substantiated the theory that man
did have his origin on the continent
of Asia before he migrated.
“Biologists in increasing num-
bers have taken up emergent evolu-
tion,” Professor Collins said in dis-
cussing some of the aspects of hi-
ology and philosophy, “a.s*'an escape
from the V’ mechanistic and vitalistic
theories." Biological research to-
day, according to the speaker, ex-
'bits an experimental trait.
Six similar lectures will follow
during the course of the year. The
pur ose of these lectures is to ac-
qua nt other members of the fac-
ulty, their families and friends,"’and

of contemporary studies in the vari-
ous ﬁelds, and with the opinions of
specialists on problems of general
interest.

Dr. Evan" T. Sage, head of the
Latin department, is chairman of
the College Lecture committee.

showing that this opinion is far
from true--at least as for as the
University of Pittsburﬁ is con-
cerned. ’

Last year of 4,191 students,
representing all students in the
four undergraduate schools, there
were but 290 who indicated that
they had _no religious preference;
and “having no religious prefer-
‘ence” certainly does not mean that
these students are tbeists, or even
agnootics. Catholicism was given
as the religion preferred by 685,
and Judaism had a following of
668. The remainder, or 2,548
embrace all other religions.

happy one doesn't need education.
Education tends to make -one less

. happy by making him loss satisﬁed.

She also said if one wants to be
happy, it will come. not through in-
trospection, but through contact

with other people in ﬁnding out his '

own faults. -
— The next meeting of Quax will be
held at the I-Ieinz House the eve-
ning of December 16. Dr. H. H.

No upfserclassmen to manage
everything and keep the school in
good working order-—it sounds like
chaos to juniors and seniors, but
some freshmen and sophomores seem
to like the idea. .

In the Junior Colleges at Johns-
town, Uniontown and Eric, they
“muddle along" without -uppei'class-
men, and never miss their lg-uiding
hands, acdording to women w 0 have
come from these centers to the Uni-
versity.

“I think it is a good idea to have
only freshman and sophomorewom-
en in the school,” declares Ida Glea-
son, Col. '32, former social editor of
the Panther Cub at Jobnstown, “be-
cause it puts them on a more equal
basis and develops their own initia-
tive. They must learn to depend
upon themselves as leaders since
there are no older women to take
the responsibility.”

“It works very well to have only
freshman and sophomore women in
school. There is an intimacy among
them impossible in a. large univer-
sity. It is not necessary to have
more experienced people in school.”
This is the opinion of Mary Alice
Reilly, Col.‘ '31, treasurer of W. A.
A. at Johnstown.

Ethel Fye, Ed. '31, who was pres-
ident of W. S. G.-A. at Johnstown,
adds, “Having only freshmen and
sophomores, the women work to-
gether and make it more like one big
class.”

Vll‘ inia Duff, Col. '31, editor of,

the C if? Dweller at Eric. is not so
sure. “It works splendidly to have
only freshman and sophomore wom-
en, but it is better to have more ex-
perienced women, too," she states.

Upperet     ;
Yes, No, Say Center Coeds

   eIp

This coed is even more doubtful.
“Without more experienced women,
a. high school spirit prevails,” ob-
serves Marian Rae, Col. ’32, active
in the social organization at Erie.
“It is more like college to have jun-
lots and seniors.”

But it took four coeds from Un.
iontown to veto the idea, Modest
Cricchi, Bus. Ad. ’32, former chair-
man of the Rooms committee at Un-
iontown; Marguerite Newcomer,
Col. ’32, treasurer of W. S. G. A.;
Pauline Kough, Col. ’32, vice presi-
dent of W. S. G. A., and Pauline
Abel, Col. '32.

As far as having only freshman
and sophomore women in school,
they all agree that it doesn't work.
At Uniontown there was too much
rivalry between the two classes, and
the _could not work together in any
9-¢t,V1l‘-Y. they explained. More ex-
perienced women in school who
know about college life can help the
Undperclassmen out when necessary.
There Is enough difference in the
ages of the women for them to work
In harmony, they concluded.

Ballots To Record Choice Of

Five Class Committee:

A plan for~the internal organiza-
tion of the class _was the most impor-
tant matter considered by the newly
elected officers of the women of the
freshman class at their first meet-
ing held at 1:30 Monday, December
8, in Heinz House. _

Careful thought. given by the exec-
utives to the formation of the vari-
ous class committees resulted _in
deﬁnite plans for the organization
of the following groups before the
Christmas vacationz. _Class sports,
hostess, social, publicity, and Why

Club
Amateurs Play

Concerning the class sports group
the primary feature emphasized by
the organizers is that  commit-
tee is not ogien for physical ed. ma-
jors, but is or the purpose of giving
the women interested_ in the various
sports an opportunity for inter-
class competition. In this manner
the class teams will not be made up
of experienced women, but _of stu-
dents interested in sports as a form
of activity.

The women of the hostess com-
mittee will assist the Y. W. C. ‘A.
and W. S, G. A. hostesses at Heinz
House each ~ day, besides assisting
at W. A. A. Play Day.

The social committee will prepare’
lunches for special group meetings
as well as assist as a sub-c_ommit-
tee to the major organizations at
Play Day, Coronation, etc. ,

The women who are members of
the staff of the Owl, Pitt Weekly,V.or
Panther, will comprise the publicity
committee; also those women .inter-
ested in making posters. .

The freshman Why Club, a Y. W.
C. A. organization of freshman wo-
men, meets each month at a din-
ner” meeting and discusses problems
of vital interest to the members.

Send Ballots

.A committee consisting of Ethel
Steffy, Bus. Ad. chairman, Joan
Stouck, Col.; Suzanne Philips, Ed.;
Jane Stover, Ed.; Cornelia Briarly,
Col.; Enice Natali, Ed., was ap-
pointed to take charge of sending
out mimeographed ballots with the
list of committees» appearing on it.
Each freshman woman will receive
one of these with the request that
she check only one committee to
which she wishes to belong. These
ballots will go out sometime this

- week.

The appointment was also made of
a committee to draw up a constitu-
tion for the class. Norma Cibula,
Ed., was selected chairman, and the
other members are Betty Quarrie,
Col.; Nellie Vugenovic, Col.; Doro-
thy Hargrave, C01

The class dues which amount to
50 cents a member are to be paid to
Doris Custer, treasurer, before
Christmas. 1

Naomi Ericson, Ed. ’31, chairman
of the organizations committee who
has been supervising the women
said, “The women are particularly

interested in organizing class-V teams-

for basketball, volleyball and other
sports lwliich will not be comprised
of the physical education majors,
but the students who are interested
in this form of activity from a
recreational point of view. They
feel that if the otherpclasses do like-
wise’ a very interesting series of in-
ter-class competitions will be ar-
ranged.”

The officers of ‘the freshman class
are: president, Marie Arnold, Bus.

Jolinstowners Plan
Organization Here

Formation of a club composed of

I former students of Johnstown -'un-

ior college is now being planne by
Harold Price, Bus. Ad. ’31. The
purpose of the club will be to con-

duct social affairs among the stu-
dents and to aid the incomin stu-
dents from the Center to etter

adapt themselves to Pitt life, ac-
cording to Price. Approximately
100 Johnstown students are at the
University at present.

At a meeting held Dec. 4, Price
was elected chairman of the commit-
tee and appointed the following
‘members: Robert Dumeyer, Eng.
’31; John Pardoe, Eng. ’31; Agnes
Timbo, Col. ’31; Mary Alice Reilly,
Ed. ’31; Olive Marley, Ed. ’32;
James Connell, Col. ’31, and Robert
Bishop, Eng. ’31.

The committee is planning a din-'
ner meeting to be held at the Fac-
ulty Club, when a permanent organ-
izafion will be elected and a consti-
tution drawn up. The committee
will then petition Student Relations
commitee for recognition. All former
students of Johnstown Junior col-
lege will be invited to become mem-
bers in case of recognition.

Pi Tau Phi Plans

For Dinner Meetings

A comparative newcomer in the
ﬁeld of honorary organizations at
the _University is Pi ;Tau Phi, or-
ganized in 1925, when Dr. Russell
Sage, head of the Latin department,
saw the need of an organization to
honor those students who had ex-
celled in the scholastic ﬁelds.

Every summer the fraternity is
host to honor graduates of all the
high schools in Allegheny county
an the principals of the schools at
a luncheon given at the University
Club. At this luncheon the deans of
the schools of the University also
are present. A round-table forum
is held in which all questions of in-

 

are discussed. This year plans are
being made for dinner meetings at
which speakers of ‘interest will ad-
grass the members of the organiza-
ion.
One of the features of Pi Tau Phi
is that membership is open to stu-
dents of all campus schools. The
upper ‘ten per cent of each school
is eligible to membership. Tapping

Roxanne Silverberg, who is the

senior court is concerned, is certain-

that, when she was able to talk _the‘

her. . .That reminds me of the

that we curled up in our boots and
died and what’s more you are able

came out of it. . .Likes do attract,

We like a certain woman on this
campus. She’s so unassuming and
yet——if we had what it takes tobe
like her, we'd put ourselves all over
thefront pages. We can imagine
her at some future day as the most
lovely model in the world, or the
most distinguished society matron,
or the most famous_ actress‘ ever
known. But you would never know
she's around if you waited to hear
about her from herself. She is Em-
ily Irwin, Kappa Alpha Theta, and
she is hereby nominated for this

Mortar ‘Board-Cwgenl
Beneﬁt Is Success

The beneﬁt theater party given by’
Mortar Board and Cwens atthe Pitt
Theater last evening, Thursday, was
declared extremely successful by
both groups.‘Atte.ndance was very
good, and the net‘ results, although
not completely known as yet, are es-
timated to be satisfactory.

The funds received from the show
will go to ﬁnance the activities of
the two organizations, Cwens and
Mortar Board, for the coming ear.
If the returns are sufficient,‘ neither
organization will ﬁnd it necessary
to give any other money-making af-
fairs the rest of this year.

Mor'eover, if the returns come up
to what is expected, this Pitt night
affair, heretofore conducted by the
Student Loan Association, will be-
come annual, given by Mortar Board

To Argue “Unemployment’
{With Cleveland Team

 

Four representatives of the Men’s
Debating Association were the cen-
tral ﬁgures in an open forum 0
unemployment insurance held in
Monongahela _ City High School,
Tuesday evening, when they argued
the question “Resolved: That the
Several States Should Adopt the
Wisconsin Plan of Unemployment
Compensation.”

The - members of the squad who
took part in the featured debate
were Paul Otto, Bus. Ad. ’33, and
Cyril-Jacobs, Bus. Ad. ’32, for the
affirmative; D. J. Butler, Bus. Ad.
’32, and Jess Spirer, Col. ’31, for
the negative. This was the fourth
squad to present an extension de-
bate so far this season.

Under the Wisconsin Plan of un-
employment compensation, which is
also known as the “discharge wage”
plan, the employer insures himself
against the payment of compensa-
tion to discharged employees. This
is one of the most popular plans for
compensation yet proposed by any
group, and offers excellent possibili-
ties for debate.

Debate Ohio School

Edward T. Crowder, Jr., Col. '31,
Men’s Debate Manager, is working
on plans for the debate with West-
ern Reserve University, scheduled
for January 15. Crowder announced
this week that in addition to the
evening meet with -Western Reserve,
the squad will present a debate be-
fore the downtown Kiwanis Club, at
the noon luncheon of that organiza-
tlon. This will have been preceded
by an extension debate in one of
the city high schools the same morn-

138

Following the noon engagement,
the Debating Association will hold
an openforum in the Heinz House
for students and faculty members.

This meeting will be featured by an-
other debate of the unemployment "

question between four members of
the squad. Crowder states that this

will be an excellent opportunity for‘

students of economics and others in-
terested in the unemployment situa-
tion to take part in debate discus-
sion and hear the arguments of the
debaters-without traveling from the
campus.

The idea in having four ,debates V

in one day, explained Crowder, is
to enable the team to become
adapted to appearing before various
types of audiences in close succes-
sion.

More Advice About Success

“I have watched the growth of the
-University with much interest.
fore settling down in Oakland, Pitt
moved -to Allegheny. As it contin-
ued, and became more powerful, it
spread. When I look at the gigantic
Cathedral, it actually makes me feel
old. I would never have predicted
that it would some day attain that
height. Yes, I must be getting old.”

‘ Mr.’ .Wilson’s formula for success
. is hard work and ambition, to help
accomplish the work. With his son,
Joseph Charles’ Wilson Junior, he
manages quite ‘a large concern suc-
cessfully. He plays golf and wants
it to be known, that it is the great-
est exercise in the world to keep one
t.

Mr. Wilson sets a ﬁne example
for college students which would be
well to follow. And, believe it or
not, we are going to get down to
work, study our lessons, surprise
perhaps someoday,
too, we will be like Mr. Wilson.

“World politics aré in a terrible
mess right now. South America is
a cauldron of revolutions- Italy is

brought about a depression in the
world's economics because she has
standardized gold as currency for

When the’ lid pops off-—it’s going to
be too bad and things will happen!”

This was the main context of an
interview with Lt.-Colonel E. J.
Cullen, professor of military sci-
ence and ‘tactics at the University.
The Colonel discussed at length the
present ‘unemployment situation, in-
ternational relations, the Nicaragua
Canal and the causes and effects of
wars.

“In. the successful culmination of
the Civil War is to be found the
seed of the astounding growth of
the_ United States. It is in the aims

~“'I'ha.t’s simple t.o see,” replied the
Colonel. “Men are prone to have
opinions. -‘We are evidently differ-
ent as individuals; so naturally our
opinions will differ. Our paciﬁst
friends see things in a certain way;

  Lieutenant-Colonel Cullen

 

‘ “Hardly. A recent decision of the
attorney no longer made compulsory
military education. It hasn’t been
done away with, however. The num-
bers have just been lessened. And
another thing. They say that stu-
ents taking R. O. T. C. work are
the laziest in the school. Why we
have the-finest bunch of fellows
here in the school. R. ‘O. T. C. men
are the leaders on the campus. And
our curriculum here won’t allow
azy men. They just can't get by,
that's all.”

“But how about the charge that
you sponsor education for war in-
stead of education for peace. ' Is
that true?”

Wants Peace

And the gray haired veteran
laughed. “No truer than the fact
of the medical. students. After work-
ing for six years cutting up people
in the laboratory do they become
criminals and murderers? Of course
not. ‘Neither do our men become
murderers. Look at me. I’ve had
all the war I want. All the mili-
tary education I want. And there
isn’t a stronger advocate of peace._”.

He laid down his pipe and con-
tinued. “The R. O. T. C. builds
leaders for Pitt. We are building
men who are loyal to the Univer-
sity. You can see that by our work
with the band and the appearance
of the cadet cheering sections at the
games. We have the ﬁnest boys in
the school. .

“-They don’t want war. A mili-
tary man doesn’t want war. It is
only the turn of events that makes
war necessary-—-and then he has to
ﬁght it. You don’t go to a butcher
to have your Ford repaired do you?
Of course not. There has to be a
specialist for everything. The same
holds for war.

“Politicians make the wa.rs—~we
merely risk life and limb in an
attempt to ﬁght them successfully.
There has always been war-and’
there always will be. If we have
to spend millions on an army (the
police) to guard our property and
rights from our own people here at
home, how can be expect much more
from a- foreign people? I tell you
it’s sad--but inevitable."

Folk Songs Feature
Glee Club Program

Glee Club develops a love for mu-
sic and an interest in the classics,
says Mrs. Robert Ayars, coach of
women's club. Girls enjoy good
music and have great fun in just
singing.

Mrs. Ayars_is using quartets and
octettes in preference to soloists, as
she feels that the voices of ' ls of
college age aren't strong e ough
nor suﬁiciently trained to do solo
work’, and that group. singing is
more effective.

Polish and Russian folk music is
of particular interest to Mrs. Ayars,

sort in glee club programs. Dur-

This story is told about Sally
Moore. Whether it happened or not
can be veriﬁed by asking her.

Sally‘ purchased an apple from
one of the unemployed on "Smith-
ﬁeld street and began eating it.
Suddenly she stopped, looked at the
apple and timidly approached the
salesman.

“Look.” she said with indignation,
"there’s a tiny little worm in this
apple.”

“Lady, lady,” deprecated the ap-
pleman, “what do you expect ft‘ a
nickel—a boa constrictor'."’

The Westward Apple Movement
should affect Oakland soon. In this
elite district, however, apples
might not be the thing. Neverthe-
less any day one might look forward
to seeing an unemployed miniature
8‘01f manager selling dwarf pears!

During the intermission last
night of the Cwens and Mortar-
board Theater party at the Pitt, a
group of the'boys were smoking in
the lobby. An elderly man walked
past with a beautiful, pure white
German police dog on a leash.

“My,” said someone, “look at that
marvelous white police dog.”

"‘Humph,” said Jack Morley, “po-
lice dogs aren’t white. Anybody
knows that’s a plainclothesman.".

Organize Cultural Group

 

Last year the women Physical Ed-
'1C3.E1OIl majors at Pitt organized a
club for all physical education ma-
Iors at Pitt and called it Physical
Education of Pitt Club, taking the
name from a previous physical ed-
~ica_tion club of Pitt having Pep as
their name. The officers for last
year were: Alice lton, Ed. '31,
president; Elizabeth avis, Ed. ’3 ,
secretary; Alice Keffer, Ed. '32,
‘;reasurer; Dorothy Lee, Ed. ’33, so-
rial chairman; Florence Schneider,
Ed. ’32, by-laws and traditions.

The purpose of organizing this
-:lub‘is as Miss Margaret McClen-

ahan, adviser, states: “To bring the‘

girls in contact with outside. ﬁelds
and to broaden their scope and not
narrow to physical education.

Last year the club held monthly
dinner meetings at which some out-
side speaker waspresent. Atthe
meetings the group discussed vari-
ous political and social conditions.

The officers for this year are: Lu-
iille Glenn, Ed. ’32, president; Alice

. Chatter

By 303 LYTLE

A few weeks ago the Panthers
prowled to Columbus to play a
footbgll game; after all the shout-
in was over and the last quarter
finished, the Buckeyes were ahead
and the Panthers had to trudge
homeward with a beating tacked to
their record. Tomorrow evening
the Panthers will again be in Co-
lumbus; this time as a. basketball
team which_1s ﬁghting‘-mad and con-
ﬁdent of winning.

Ohio has a mighty good team,
and the Pitt outﬁt was anything but
good against Western Reserve. In
ordinary circumstances, everything
would point to a Buckeye victory
and another. Panther setback. Doc

Carlson, however, has a team which
Is quite_ou of the ordinary. No
one realizes. tter than the players
.themselves just how terrible they
were last Saturday, and they are
determined that this week will be
entirely different. Hank Shank,

_ . that clever boy from Mumpwa, saw

the Western Reserve game and
thinks that the game was a part of
Dr. Carlson's clinic and that the
doctor was showing the crowd how
. basketball games can be lost easily
;, and without much effort.

 

g _ Last Saturday's game is over, and
5 it has taught t e boys a few things
:.tha.t practice sessions cannot teach.
; Overconﬁdence will be one thing

1 1-ithat this year's team will do with-

:out the remainder of the season.

‘ 7‘-They are still cocky and conﬁdent
§Pan_thers_, but never again will they
’ ;‘ underestimate a rival’s ability.

Doc Kowallis and Don Smith are

, 1 two boys who can, and will, do big

things basketballically (ah) this
winter. Doc is beginning his sec-
ond year as a varsity man and is
all set to have his greatest season.
He is best at guard, but at present
is holding down a forward berth in
a. manner which leaves nothing to
be desired. Don Smith has come
up from last year's unbeaten fresh-
man team, and has started out like
a veteran. Don learns from every
mistake and is a real ball hawk. He

' can also play center as well as he

does guard, and isone of therea-
sons why Carlson is conﬁdent of
turning out another great team.

Although football is practically
over for the year, the rumblings
and murmurings are still in the air.
It is an accepted fact that the N otre

 

Dame team is the champion of them

-. all, but numerous discussions are‘.
taking place about just where it
ranks in comparison to other cham-
pionship outﬁts of past years. Last
week I was talking to a man who
is prominent in football circles and
who has seen every outstanding
team of the past twenty years. He
ranks the present Rockne machine
among the best but claims that one
team which had an edge on it was
was the-great Pitt team of 1916.
1 Comparisons of this sort are of lit-
tle importance, but it is good to
hear that a Panther team is among
those present in “immortality row.

Blues Defeat Golds
In Preliminary Tilt

The Blue team won the prelimi-
nary game to the Pitt-Western Re-
serve basketball tilt at the stadium
last Saturday over the Gold_s by a
25-15 score. Both teams were com-
posed of members of the freshman

asketball squad.

The winners’ lineup consisted of
Hughes and McBride, forwards-
Harapas, center, and Macamant and
O’dell, the fresh football player,
guards. The losers started the
game with Beck and Bogda, for-
wards; Ochsenhirt, center, and
Brourman and Hunt, guards.

Brourman led the scorers from
both_ teams with nine points to his
credit. Macamant was not far he-
hind with eight points on his tall
sheet. Bogda and Hughes eacli
scored four points.

Both teams used the same style
of attack. The boys played well
and hopes are high for them to go
through another undefeated season.
Pitt freshman basketball teams
have not lost a game since the early
part of the 1927-1928 season.

The freshman team will play its
first game on December 23 with
Schenley High of Pittsburgh form-
ing the opposition. This game will
be a preliminary to the Pitt-Dart-
mouth game.

Gridiron Stars Turn
Independent Cagers

Several members of the Pitt foot-
ball team who played basketball in
111811 School have banded together
and have formed a cage team which
will play the leading amateur teams
-in the district. This te is called
the Panther Collegians.

;‘ The roster of this team includes

RIP" Collins, “Eddie” Hirshberg,
_Pai_1l_ Reider, Paul Cuba, Rocco
Cutri and Warren Heller. This
team held its ﬁrst workout last
T‘18_3d3Y when they scrimmaged
against the local Y. I. H. A. team
and made a good showing.

Collins was a former star at Cen-
t1‘81' H1811. Sioux City, Iowa. Hirsh-
berz was an all-W. P. 1. A. L.
guard at McKeesport High. Cuba.
and Reider were regulars on the
New Castle High team which won
the W. P. I. A. L. championship in

On A__ll-Team

Pitt Gridders S e le c t
All-Opponent Team 3
Mullins, Fullback

Four Notu Dame players, three
Carnegie Tech players, two Ohio
State men, and one man each from
Syracuse and Nebraska were named
on the all-opponent team picked by
the members of the Pitt football
squad. -

“Jumping Joe" Savoldi of Notre
Dame was considered‘ as the best
fullback to play against the Pan-
thers this season but due to the
fact that he did not complete his
collegiate career_he was not picked
on the team, Larry Mullins, 
teammate, being given the ﬁrst
string plunging berth.

The other three backﬁeld men
were Schwartz of Notre Dame and
Eyth of Carnegie Tech, halfbacks,
and Frank Carideo of the Irish,
quarterback. Carideo was consid-
ered the keenest quarterback to
play against the Panthers this sea-
son and every player on the Pit‘.
team considered him the greatest
player to play against them.

Fesler Honored

At the ends, Fesler of Ohio State,
and Ted Rosenzweig of Carnegie
Tech received the nod. Fesler was
named as the best end to ever don
cleats. “It is easy to see,” re-
marked one of the Pitt boys, “why
he has been chosen on practically
every all-American team for the
past three years.” Rosenzweig

 

earned hispost; mainly through his’

offensive value.

Bill Bell, colored tackle from Ohio
State, and Broadstone, rock-ribbed
Nebraska. tackle, were placed at
their favorite positions on the first
team. Broadstone was considered
the cleverest tackle to play against
the Panthers for many years.

At the guards, John Dreshar of

Tech and Bert Metzger of the Irish
received the nod. Dreshar has
played a stellar role for the Tartans
in their meetings with the Panthers
for the past three years. Metzger
was the best offensive guard to play
a ainst the Panthers this year. A
Pitt tackle said that on some plays,
Metzger took out three men him-
self. He reminded the Pitt boys of
Alec Fox, the best offensive guard
to don a Panther uniform._
Berger At Center

Berger of Syracuse was chosen
as center on the all-opponent team.
The Panthers consider him as the
greatest center of the year and
they are also wondering why he
has not received more mention on
the All-American selection-s than he
has thus far.

Two of the men placed on the
second team were especially praised
by the Panther gridders. Selby of
Ohio State was the fastest guard
to op ose Pitt this season while
Gene osephs, Mountaineer end, left
little to be desired at his post.

The entire roster of the first and
second teams is as follows:

Panthers Honored
On Opponent Team

Seven Pitt football men were
honored on the All-Opponent team
picked by the West Virginia Moun-
taineer gridders. Only those men
who took part in each of the ten
games on the West Virginia sched-
ule balloted. Pitt placed more men
on the gridfers’ selection than any
other school met by the West Vir-
ginians.

The only Panther to receive a first
team position was Ca tain “Eddie"
Baker, who was place at the quar-
terback post. Three men were picked
on the second team. There were
“Rip” Collins, end; Tully, tackle, and
Daugherty, center. McMurdo, Quatse
and Hart Morris were given honor-
able mention.

Phys. Eds. Trounce
Dent Gridders, 10-0

Last Saturday afternoon at the
Trees Gym ﬁeld, the Dents went
down to defeat before the Phys.
Eds. by a 10-0 count. This game
established the Phys. Eds. as foot-
ball champions of the University of
Pittsburgh. The victors were
coached by Ray Montgomery, all-

 

11, American guard at Pitt last year,

and the losers were under the tute-
lage of Tom “Pug” Parkinson, full-

First Meet

Pitt Relay Team and Hanna
Break Pool Records

 

Pitt mermen emerged as victors
in the practice meet held with the
Homestead Library Club last
Wednesday, defeating the Home-
stead club by the score of 39 to 27.
Two former Pitt pool records were
shattered by Pitt boys. The relay
team composed of Reilly, Woold-
ridge, Norton and Adlersberg broke
the 100-yard relay record of 1:19
and established a new time of
1:15 4-5. Reilly, who swam the first
leg of the relay, did it under 19
seconds, while Wooldridge showed
remarkable form despite the fact
that he had not participated in a
meet for some time. The other rec-
ord was broken when “Mike”
Hanna, brilliant sophomore, estab-
lished a new 220-yard record of
2:25 4-5 over the old time of 2:31.

The relay, the ﬁrst event of the
meet, was the most thrilling of all
the races from the standpoint of
the spectators. Reilly, swimming
ﬁrst, gave Wooldridge a slight lead
which he increased to ten feet.
Norton, swimming third, increased
the lead to ﬁfteen feet, and Adlers-
berg, anchor man, ﬁnished with a
twenty-foot lead over his opponent.

Lindberg was the outstanding
star for the losers and also high
point man of the meet. In win-
ning the 150-yard backstroke and
the 100-yard free style, he displayed
remarkable ability.

Independent Teams

Will Open Season

With basketball season having
been officially opened by the Pitt-
Western Reserve game at the sta-
dium last Saturday, the department
of Physical Education is turning its
attention toward the organization
of the independent league, open for
any group on the campus other than
fraternities.

Although the league will not
open its season until after the holi-
days, Director Dambach urges all
the campus organizations intending
to enroll in the league do so before
the holidays,
schedule may be arranged at an
early date. The number of teams
competing in the league has not yet
been determined.

Director Dambach also stated
that the officials for the games will
be carefully selected to avoid con-
troversy between teams that have
characterized others years‘ playing.

Greeks Next

After the independent league is
started, the call for inter-fraternity
representatives will be sent out.
The inter-fraternity league is open
to any fraternity on the campus.

It is advisable for all houses to
have their rosters ready when the
call for competing teams is made.
This will greatly lessen the work of
the department of Physical Educa.
tion in compiling the schedule, and

All Pittsburgh Team Vie:

With Westerners

_._....__~

Tomorrow night the University
of Michigan swimming team, Big
Ten Conference champions in 1929
and 1930, will invade the city to
meet an all-Pittsburgh swimming
team, made up of the various local
clubs and school teams, at the Key-

stone Athletic Club pool.

Pitt varsity mermen who will
swim. in the meet are: Captain Fred
Wooldridge, Hanna, Swenson, from
the fresh squad; Norton, Carik ‘and
Adlersberg. “Buss” Wright, for-
mer Pitt captain and leader of the
P. A. A., and some of his team-
mates will support the local team.

For the Pitt boys, Jack Hanna
will probably swim in either the
440 or 220 free style; Captain Wool-
dridge will swim in the 150 back-
stroke; Carik will be a leading
entrant in the dive and possibly the
backstroke; Swenson will swim the
backstroke. Norton will swim in
the 100. or 50 free style, and Ad-
lersberg will swim in the free style
relay or breast stroke.

The Michigan team has been one
of the strongest college teams in
the country. Matt Mann's mermen
not only have won the Big Ten Con‘-

but they have always been well rep-
resented in the all-American swim-

- be met by the Panthers

ming teams.

 

Panthers Meet Buckeyes

Tomorrow In Clinic Game 

 

‘Somewhat dismayed by the defeat which they suffered in
their opening tilt of the season and only the second loss of Pitt
basketball teams at the stadium in the last four years but ‘nev-

ertheless a team still full of ﬁght and pluck, the Panther cagers »

will board a train tonight forflolumbus, Ohio, where tomorrow
evening they will play the Buckeyes in the feature of the latter

/\
V

school's annual basketball clinic.
This game will also be the first

. one on the Panthers annual western

trip. 1Heretofore, it has been the
custom of the Pitt team tomeet

. only teams in the “Big Ten” Con-

ference but the Buckeyes. are the
lone team from that group who will
on this
trip.
Meets Zone Defense ,

The other games will be played
with Marquette University, at Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin, on December 17;
Nebraska at Lincoln, Nebraska on
December 19, and Creighton Uni-

versity at Omaha, Nebraska, on the -

following day. _
The Panthers will have their
hands full throughout this trip. Lit-
tle is known of the makeup of the
teams whom the Panthers will be
called upon to meet except for the
fact that each-likes its basketball
players over the six-foot mark and
Creighton and Marquetteboth em-
ploy the zone defence. 8. system
which has always proven trouble-
some to Carlsons type of offense.
Wesley Fesler and Larkins, two
Buckeye football stars, will be in
the lineup for the Buckeye bas-
keteers.. Fesler was captain of the
team last year which forced the

‘ Panthers to go an extra period he-
. fore the bacon was put away safely

on the Pitt side of the ledger. The
score of that game was 38-33.
Buckeyes Have Chance .

The Buckeyes have been meetin
the Panthers .on the basketbal-
court for the past three years and
never once have the Ohioans re-
turned the victors. Their best
chance will come tomorrow and no
doubt they will seize this opportu-
nity of giving the Panthers the
game of their lives.

Marquette, the next team to be
met by the Panthers, has been prac-
ticing since October 15. Twenty
men took part in these workouts
and seven more came out for the
team at the end of the football sea-
son.

Marquette is an up and coming"
school inlthe ﬁeld of sports.‘ For
the past few years they have placed
at least one man on the All-America
hockey team and their football
team -this year was undefeated un-
til the ﬁnal game of the season.
Iowa, conquerors of Nebraska, was
one of the teams to fall before the
Milwaukee boys.

There is some confusion over a

Phi. The game was not played as
scheduled and the victory was glven
to Omega Delta who calmed that
since the Pi Lambda boys did not
show up, the latter had forfeited It.
However, the Pi Lambda boys pro-
tested, claiming that they under-
stood the game to have been post-

Hope Speaks
On Aristotle

Adam... Social s cience
Seminar On Reasoning

 

“For Aristotle, existence in gen-
eral and the life of man in particu-
lar, rest upon a physical basis, but
tend towards an ideal completion.
Thus nature is viewed as a. process
of development which eventuates in
the reason,” declared Dr. Richard
Hope, associate professor of phi-
losophy, in an address delivered be-
fore the Social Science Seminar on
“ ‘The Reasoning’ in Aristotle’s De

Anima.” An abstract of the ad-
dress follows:
“Reasoning is furthermore re-

garded as the natural culmination
of life no less than nature, includ-
ing what we do as biological organ-
isms and what we say as rational
animals. Reasoning is therefore a
natural, biological and logical fact.
Among the terms employed by
Aristotle for reasoning are such as
have been taken from lower proc-
esses, such as speech and sight. The
latter especially grow out of Aris-
totle’s advocacy of the spectator at-
titude in knowledge, according to
which an intellectual would view
the universe and life as a spectator
in the theatre. I
Reasoning Ideal ‘ ‘
“All these modes of speech imply
that reasoning originates in the im-
pinging of the material world upon
the bodies of rational beings, but is
itself an ideal fulﬁllment of the
physical. ' i '
“Thephysical and biological ori-

gin and the logical and terminal“-

character of the reason imply that
nature and man, rooted though they
are in the physical, realize their
destinies in the realm of the ideal,
and that logic can be subordinated
to ‘life only because life is subordi-
nate to logic.”

labor and the greatest consumers
of the products of other industry.
The Government needs our great

5% railroad system as the nation’s

largest corporate taxpayer. Railway
taxes aggregate more than one mil-
lion dollars daily.

However, the popular question to-
day is: “What is the matter with
the railroads?” Intellig“tn«t consid-

0 eration of this inquiry suggests an-

other question: “Do we really need
our railways?” The railways con-
tinue to handle the great bulk of

_the nati-on’s freight traffic with

great efficiency. They have served
as a national relief agency and have
always recognized their obligation to
-the public. In addition they have
responded to every governmental
request for relief in emergencies.

_. “Railroad Strategy” was the sub-
ject discussed by Dr. Kidd. He
maintains that the ﬁeld of business
education is advancing greatly and
that stress is now laid on thinking
power. The greater part of his
speech dealtlwith railroad consolida-
tion and diplomacy.

Mr. -John M. Fitzgerald and Mr.
Theodore A. Siedle, secretary of the
Downtown Division and Instructor
in vocational education were initi-
ated as honorary members. ‘

ticularly the peasant art of V the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The plans which were drawn by
Dr. Andrey Avinoff, director of the
ﬁne arts department of Carnegie’
Institute and instructor in the ﬁne
arts department of the University,
are now completed. Work on some
parts of the furniture has already
begun with the help of the Russian
wood carvers residing in Pitts-
burgh. For many centuries wood
carving of every descri tion has
been popular in the nort ern prov-
inces of Russia where forests are
abundant.

With simple tools the Russian
craftsmen fashioned objects of the
household and decorated parts of
his dwelling and furniture in keep-
ing with the ancient tradition of mo-
tives and styles. In the years pre-
ceding the war, remarkable publica-
tions were issuedwhich made ac-
cessible to the student of art numer-
ous and notable examples of native
carved wood, as preserved in pub-
lie and private collections. The
decoration and furniture of the Rus-
sian room were planned in accord-
dance with these sources of infor-
mation.

The ‘chairs and benches will be
carved with cross-like openings
which are characteristic of furniture
and fences in the northern prov-
inces of Russia. Since genuine, old
Russian chairs and benches usually
had perpendicular backs and were
not particularly comfortable, the

The University employment .. bu-
reau reports two positions avail-
able in the technical division of a
large oil company, ‘ .

The ﬁrst requires ﬁve years of
mechanical engineering experience
in a steel mill. Power or mainte-
nance experience would be partic-
ularly desirable. The applicants
must be between thirty-three and
_forty years of age and must pos-
sess J. thorough knowledge of the
lubrication of modern steel mill ma-
chin-erry. This position is in West-
ern Pennsylvania and pays approxi-
mately $4,500 per year.

The secon-d position is similar. ex-
cept that the steel mill experience
is not required. Power plant ex-
perience would be desirable. This
position calls for a man between the
ages of thirty-two and thirty-eight
and pays approximately $3,600» per

backs of the chairs for the class-
room are being changed slightly, giv-
ing them a slight curve.

The professor’s table will have
an inclined top like those used for
reading the Scriptures in the Rus-
sian churches. The conference ta-
ble for the students will be of solid,
simple workmanship, following ex-
amples of woodwork in northern and
central districts of Russia. In one
of the corners of the rooms will be
placed a cupboard which will be
adorned by images in colors of the
sirin and the alcanost, the legendary
birds with the heads of women. A
small carved table will bear an ar-
chaic geometrical decoration found
in various regions of Russia. All
furniture is to be of massive oak.

The blackboard on the wall will
be shaped as a triptych, the re-
verse of the two wings being carved
in a manner similar to that used on
the professor’s armchair. On one of
the walls will be hung an embroid-

Vladimir cycle created in the “Holy
Russia” of past ages and still lin-

  Gory Pirates

In New Play

Sober Brandishes Sword For
Beauty and Booty

 

“Captain Applejack” may wave
a beer bottle aloft when he leads
the pirate crew in that bloody
chanty, “Fifteen men on a dead
maii’s chest; Yo-ho, and a bottle of
rum” in the second act of the Pitt
Players’ production which will be
presented February 19 at the Y. M.
and Y. W. H. A. auditorium. This
role is being played by Clarence
Sober, Dent. ’3l.

In the second act, the pirate ship
will be the setting. Against a back-
ground of flashing swords and bran-
dished pistols, the valorous captain
mus-t defend his ‘gold and the cap-
tive womaii (who, by the way, is
Barbara Ann Hartman, Col. ’33),
from his mutinous crew. The crew
and the captain cut cards for the
treasure and the lady, and the au-
dience is given two guesses as to

act is interesting is that Elaine
Blauvelt, Col. '34, plays the part of
the cabin, boy.

“I think this is an excellent one,
because it has all the elements usu-
ally lacking in plays of today,” said
Carl N. Cass, when questioned about
the merits of “Captain Applejack.”
“It has an element of make-believe
and romance; strictly speaking, it is

stage presentations.”

The play was sub-titled “An Ara-
bian Night's Adventure in Three
Acts” by the playwright, Walter
Hatchett.

Tickets for p“Captain Applejack”
will be sold in the hallway of Alum-
ni Hall for several days before the
‘night of the play. And if you want
to capture a little of the fun and
frolic of a pirate ship buy a ticket.

Chinese Student Life.
Subject For Tea Talk

A lecture on “Student Life in
China,” by Dr. James Henry, for-
merly president of Canton Chris-

sity, the presentation of a Hunga-
rian etching by Mr. Mihok, presi-
dent of the Hungarian Student Club,
and negro spirituals by the Tuske-
gee Institute quartet featured the
International Tea held at the
Heinz House last Wednesday after-
noon. The program was arranged
by the World’s Fellowship Commit-
tee of the University Y. M. C. A.

Dr. Henry expressed the interest
the Chinese student evidenced in pol-
itics and social enterprises. The
Lingnan University -has instituted
student government, and the stu-
dents show vital interest in its un-
dertakings. The etching oresented
by Mr. Mihok was given by the Hun-
garian students of the American col-
leges in appreciation of the help

Don’t let anyonekid you, times
are tough! At practically every
downtown corner, you can see men
selling apples. Even midgets are
selling crab apples. Three apple
vendors patrol the Pitt campus, and
inveigle the unsuspecting students
into parting with their nickles for
the pleasure of biting into a big,
luscious, red apple.

Lewis Marcus, colored, is sta-
tioned in front of Mellon Institute,
He had been living a life of leisure
for thepast year, not being able to
get any kind of work. He reports
that his business is “in the red.” He
believes that Pit‘. students should
eat more apples, because not only
“will an apple a day keep the doctor
away,” but if you purchase a; ples,
you help keep the wolf away ‘from
his door. However, we forgot to
mention to him that even doctors
mhit live.

and Blade, starting this year, to the
best rated battery; and the unit
selling the most ball tickets will be
granted ﬁfty per cent toward the
