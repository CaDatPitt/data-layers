Nationality roomcomes alive

By Beth McLaughlin
Staﬁ'Wn'ter

The Polish nationality room’s design history is like
a fairy tale.

The room is a replica of a castle in Wawel where
Polish kings lived and heros were put to rest. King
Sigismund married an Italian princess from the Sforza
family. To make her feel at home he brought in

painters, sculptors and craftsmen from Italy to redo’

the castle. Polish woodcarvers, painters and silver-
srniths added their ethnic touches. The castle was
transformed into a 16th-Century combination of
Poland’ s golden age and Italy’s renaissance styles.
Professor A. Szyszko-Bohusz, famed for restora-
tion of Polish castles, designed the Polish room. The
-18-foot Gothic beams cover the room’s ceiling. The
beams are of Italian design, but the richly painted pat-

terns on them are Polish style. A suing of garland,

painted in Italian ‘style, goes around the room like a
wallpaper border.

“The _furniture is Polish and very strong and sturdy,”
Holly R Smiﬂr, a nationalityroom tour guide, said. “It
is modeled after the state dining room in the castle.”

Above the table hangs a brass chandelier with sev-
eral naked light bulbs. Perched on top of the lights is

an eagle, a symbol of Poland Beyond the tables and

chairs is a huge stained-glass bay window. Coats of
arms from various Polish universities give color to the
window. The cornerstone is taken directly from
Jagielonian University in Krakow, which was estab-
lished in 1364. The stone was taken and set here
almost 600 years later.

Another original piece of history in the room is in a
glass case in the comer. It is the original manuscript to
the opera Manru, the only opera written by
Paderewski. He was a Polish patriot, as well as a

(Editors Note: This is the ﬁrst of a
two-part series on animosity
between Greek and non-Greek
students at Pitt. )

Anyone who hasn’t been living
under a rock for the past couple of
years is aware of the animosity
between Greeks and indepen-
dents, especially throughout the
past few months. .

Many Greeks say that they are
tired of being perceived as beer-
guzzling, perverted jocks and
brainless, materialistic snobs.

Many independents say that
they are tired of being perceived
as either blue-haired, body-pierced
Beehive regulars or pocket-protec-
tor computer nerds.

There are few things that these
two sides have in common, but

the one pointof agreement is that r

they both feel prematurely labeled
and ignorantly misjudged.

Many people, including social
psychologist Keri Ryan, feel that
these two groups could learn a lot
from one another and get much
more accomplished if they
stopped stereotyping on a general
level as Greeks and independents
and began communicating on a
personal level as students. -

Studying abroad is experience of a lifetime

The Pitt News

The weather stinks. The Cowboys won. The school work seems end-
less. At a time when all seems hopeless, there is a place tucked away in
Forbes Quad (4G to be exact) where you can seek refuge. If youhave
ever considered studying abroad, now is the time to do it.

Pitt Provost James Maher has recently approved a $10,000 grant to
the Study Abroad Oﬁice to -assist students who have previously been
underrepresented in study abroad programs. The result is 10 $1,000
scholarships divided among minority students, students in the schools of
library and information science, engineering, nursing and the College of
-General Studies. Some scholarships will be for some of the Pitt-devel-
oped programs, including the newest exchange program in Australia

Through researching programs in the Study Abroad Ofﬁce you will
learn that the possibilities for studying abroad are endless. A student in
any major can study overseas. New programs are being created in
Mexico for engineering students and more programs are being created

_. These are two-way exchange programs where a Pitt student goes

Pitt-developed study abroad programs have been designed by depart-
ments, programs and schools within the university. The costs for these
programs are about the same as Pitt, with a few exceptions. Pitt offers
semester, year-long and summer programs in England, France, Italy,
Japan and Germany. Applications are currently being accepted for the
summer programs in Paris/Nantes, Rome and the new architectural
studies program in London.

Another easy way to study abroad is through Pitt exchange programs.

abroad and a foreign student comes to Pitt. The cost is usually the equiv-
alent of Pitt tuition, fees, room and board. Study abroad choices include
England, France, Japan, Mexico and Wales. A brand-new opportunity
for students is to study at the University of Newcastle in Australia
Pitt is also afﬁliated with some intemational organizations through
which a student can choose to go abroad. Besides studying abroad,
internships and work opportunities are also available. Vlfrth programs in
all comers of the world, you’re sure to ﬁnd the one that is right for you.

Medicare trust fund loses money for first time in 24 years

E? World Events

ILIDZA, Bosnia and
Herzegovina — The latest
United Nations-brokered agree-
ment permits the Serbian police
to remain for 45 more days as
long as they honor the laws of
the Muslim-Croatian federa-
tion. The police were due to
withdraw on Saturday as part of
the transfer of the Serbian-held
suburbs to the Bosnian govem-
ment.

The arrangement is part of a

last—ditch effort by the United
Nations to allay the fears of the
50,000 Serbs in the five sub-
urbs of the capital who say they
will ﬂee once the Muslim-dom-

inated Bosnian government-

takes control. The New York

BEIJING — China mobilized
its military for rescue work and
appealed for international assis-
tance after a powerful earth-
quake leveled thousands of
mud-walled village homes
Saturday night and killed more
than 200 people in the southern

province of Yunnan.

Rescue workers struggled to
cope with 14,000 injured resi-
dents, 3,800 of them seriously
injured, the state-run New
China Agency said. The New

WASHINGTON — New gov-
ernment data show that
Medicare’s Hospital Insurance
Trust Fund lost money for the
first time since 1972, suggest-
ing that the financial condition
of the Medicare program was
worse than assumed by either
Congress or the Clinton admin-
istration.

In April, the administration
estimated that the amount in the
trust fund would increase by
$4.7 billion in the 1995 fiscal
year, which ended on Sept. 30.
In fact, officials said in inter-
views that the balance in the
trust fund fell by $35.7 million,

. to $129.5 billion. The New York
Times

LOS ANGELES — Even
though Los Angeles voters
approved a- multimillion-dollar

bond issue more than three
years ago to build a modern 911
dispatching system for police
and fire services, a record num-
ber of 911 phone calls went
unanswered last year, LAPD
statistics show.

Last year, more than 325,000
calls, or 13 percent, were not
answered, the highest number
of unanswered calls in any year
since the system was installed
in 1984, according to statistics
that were made public last
week. The New York Times

WASHINGTON — The
squadron commander of the F-
14 pilot in the Nashville crash
that killed ﬁve people last week
has been relieved of his com-
mand, the Navy announced.

Citing three accidents over
the last year, the Navy decided
to reassign the commander,
Fred Kilian, because of “a loss
of trust and confidence” in his
ability to lead the squadron,
said a spokesman, Cmdr. Gregg
Hartung.

Fighter Squadron 213 had
developed by far the worst safe-
ty record among the Navy’s 13
F-14 squadrons, with four
crashes over the last 16 months,
three after Cmdr. Kilian became
its leader. The New York Times

“Greeks are perceived to value

certain things that independents
don’t, like money and prestige,”
she said, “whereas independents
are perceived to value academics
and individual character.”
_ Ryan said that some indepen-
dents say they would like to join
the Greek system, but are unable
to meet certain ﬁnancial criteria

“The continuous increase in
cost for higher education is a full
responsibility for many students,
especially those who pay their
tuition independently,” she said.
“The Greek system adds another
layer of ﬁnancial responsibility
that many students can’t affo .”.

Ryan said that the unequal bal-
ance of available resources con-

. tributes to the animosity.

“Greeks have more access to

obtain leadership roles on cam-

Ryan said that the accumula-

tinues to aggravate the situation.

“I have been talking to Greeks
who are strongly concerned about
the negative publicity that they
have been receiving from the
public,” she said. “The national
membership of certain fraternities
are no longer held in the highest
esteem that they once used to be.”

Ryan said that people feel
threatened that the security of
their social identity will be dimin-

Pitt's morality police

Hello, this is the morality police. Open your door and let the
university see who’s in your bedroom.

This sounds like a bad line from a horrible bastardization of
Animal House, run only at three or four in the morning. But no,
it’s here in living color. Or at least in print. The University of
Pittsburgh has issued a decree, resulting from the actions of an
anti-sexual harassment task force, which prohibits relationships
between instructors and students.

Doesn’t this sound just a tad bit intrusive to anyone?

While it may be unethical or unprofessional for an instructor
to be “involved” with a student, it is not the university’s job to
decide who can and who cannot see whom. Exactly how will the
Powers That Be determine whether or not an instructor is seeing
a student? If someone notices a, more-than-usual-length eye con-
tact between the two, does that mean they are sleeping together?
Are instructors not allowed to have lunch with students any-
more? Exactly what is going to be forbidden by this proclama-
non?

The student-teacher relationship policy is going to present
several problems. First, what about students who have been dat-
ing someone for a while, who just happens to teach a class the
student needs to graduate. There would be absolutely no connec-
tion between the relationship and the class, and any instructor
with any sense of ethics would keep the relationship out of his
or her judgement regarding the student’s class work. This might
seem like a far—fetched scenario, but it has happened in the past
and will probably happen again.

What happens when an instructor meets a person in a social
setting, likes the person, asks him or her out, then finds out the
person is a student in a 300-seat biology class? Or what happens
when two people are simply compatible and enjoy each other’s
company? Is it really the university’s place to say who you are
allowed to date? No. v

The rationale‘ behind the dating policy is supposedly to protect
students from unfair treatment by teachers. We have all heard
the stories of a professor calling a student to his or her office in
order to ‘’improve’’ their grade.(nudge, nudge, wink, wink)
There is’ nothing at all funny or justifiable about this kind of
behavior. But there are other avenues available for a student to
pursue this kind of complaint. Instructors who practice this kind
of “teaching” should be thrown in the street, directly out of their
jobs. ' - ’ ‘

Dating a teacher or student is truly risky business, and we
don’t recommend it. It could easily be misinterpreted by others
as something it probably isn’t, and it could have very negative
repercussions for either party if the relationship ends in the mid-
dle of a class.  ‘

However, it is not the university’s place to make an official
policy prohibiting behavior outside of the classroom. Unless you
have sex in the instructor’s office, who would know anyway?

A shorttime ago most politi-
cal pundits thought that affir-
mative action would be the big
issue for campaign ‘96. The
Governor of California, Pete
Wilson, went so far as to abol-
ish all state affirmative action
programs in an effort to jump-
start his political campaign
(Wilson ended up dropping out
of the race). With the religious
right pushing the Republican
Party’ towards social conser-
vatism, affirmative action
seemed to be a huge issue.
However, in the past month, the
whole 1996 campaign has been
turned on its ear. It seems that
the only issue being talked
about now is whether.or not
America should have a ﬂat tax
system. We have one man to
thank for this: Steve Forbes.

Before he began his run for
president last year, Steve
Forbes was little more than an
eccentric multimillionaire and
the leader of the Forbes finan-
cial empire. Now, with the cru-
cial" Iowa Republican
Presidential Caucus rapidly
approaching on Feb. 12th,
Steve Forbes is climbing quick-
ly in the polls thanks -to his ﬂat
tax proposal. In the past month,
Forbes’ ﬂat tax has pushed him
from fourth place in nationwide
Republican vote to second
place behind the front-running
Senator Robert Dole. With the

news media sensing a potential

rival to the five-term Senate
veteran, Forbes is sureto get
increasing attention in the com-
ing weeks. Recently, both
Newsweek and Time magazines
have featured stories about

Forbes and his ﬂat tax on their

covers. It’s a shame that a care-
ful examination of Forbes’ tax
plan shows that it is a bad idea
which should not be enacted
into law.

' Polls show that the American
people favor the idea of the ﬂat
tax, but when it comes to the
actual details, support drains
away. The American people
reject Forbes’ idea of taxing

Opposing Mr. Flat Tax Forbes

Michael
Berqurst

everyone’s income at a ﬂat rate
of 17 percent by a margin of 48
percent to 41 percent Fifty-ﬁve
percent of Americans would
oppose a ﬂat tax if it eliminated
tax deductions for state and
local taxes. Fifty—seven percent
would oppose such a tax if it
targeted wages and not profits
from sales of stock and real‘
estate. Sixty percent oppose ‘a
ﬂat tax if it eliminated tax
deductions for home mort-
gages. A whopping eighty-ﬁve
percent would oppose a ﬂat tax
if it increased the budget deﬁcit.
In each case, Forbes’ ﬂattax
would do all of these things.

Unfortunately, Forbes’ plan
will do considerable damage to
the federal budget. The
Department of the Treasury has
projected that a rate of 21 per-
cent will be needed for Forbes’
tax to be revenue-neutral. When
asked how his plan would bal-
ance the budget, Forbes replied:
“Who says it has to be revenue-
neutral?” Projections show that
under Forbes’ tax system the
government would lose $200
billion a year. Forbes has been
cavalier in assuming that eco-
nomic growth will close the
budget gap, which is the same
sort of thinking that resulted in
the federal budget deﬁcit.

Under Forbes’ plan, people
living on interest, dividends and
capitol gains will pay zero
taxes. Allan Sloan, who former-
ly worked at Forbes magazine,
has criticized this inequality in
Forbes’ tax because rich bil-
lionaires like Bill Gates can
simply sell their stock, pocket
the tax-free proﬁts and live the
rest of their lives tax-free, while
their employees will still have
to continue to pay 17 percent of
their income in taxes for the
rest of their lives. Unfair? You
better believe it.

The rich will receive a signif-
icant boost. under Forbes’ plan
while the poor will suffer.

Under Forbes’ tax, a married
couple that makes $20,000 a
year will not have to pay any
taxes, but they will lose their
$355 dollar tax rebate that they
receive from the government
(which is essentially the same
thing as a tax increase). A mar-
ried couple making $75,000 a
year would see their taxes drop
20 percent from $8,999 to
$7,470 dollars. Another married

couple making $300,000 ayear’ in

would see their taxes fall 80
percent from $77,220 to
$42,933. Under a ﬂat taxrthe
rich will simply get richer and
the poor will get poorer.
Forbes’ own taxes would
decrease by $128,000 a year.

Undoubtedly a ﬂat tax will

favor the wealthy.
Forbes’ success in the polls

has led his Republican rivals to I

jump on the ﬂat tax bandwag-
on. Senator Phil Gramm of
Texas has proposed a ﬂat tax
system with -a rate of 16 percent
and isolationist Pat Buchanan
has proposed a ﬂat tax of 15
percent. Perhaps the sole GOP
candidate giving the American
public a straight talk on the ﬂat
tax is long-shot businessman
Morry Taylor. Pointing out the
unfairness of not taxing profits
on the sale of stock, Taylor says
to audiences: “I sold $15 mil-
lion of stock to get into this
thing. I paid $5 million to Uncle

.Sam."‘Under Steve Forbes’ plan

I wouldda paid nuthin. The
guys who work for me would
pay 17 percent on what they
earn, and I would have paid no
tax at all. And that is wrong.”

While Forbes may have some
interesting ideas and his desire
to change America’s badly
flawed income tax system is
laudable, his ﬂat tax would
make an already unfair system
even worse. Forbes’ plan may
merit an “A” for creativity, but
it must receive an “F” for its
speciﬁcs.

Pitt puts forth a good effort
of making opponents feel

schools also follow this pat-
tern. ’

Villanova University,
which prides itself on emu-
lating the Ivy League, is an
exception.

During Saturday’s 88-55

competition. Cornell was not a fac-
tor in the meet, as Pitt won 188.275
to 168.7.

The Lady Panthers focused on
maintaining Pitt’s lOth—place
national standing in the floor com-
petition, nailing a dismount and
adding a new degree of difficulty
to a program. The top three finish-
ers, Stevens, Robin Senior and Lori
Buck helped break a team record in
the bars with a total of 47.35. The
previous team—high set in 1993 was
47.2. - '

Michaelene Myers also set a new
school record of 9.8 on the beam.
Myers, a senior, broke last week’s
school record of 9.775. She gave a
solid, unwavering performance
with two back handsprings. into a
layout, and the judges rewarded her
effort with their scores.

“Toni Curtis is a hard judge.
That’s amazing,” said former
Panther gymnast Meg Johns in
response to Myers’ scores.

“Last week I broke the record,

there’s still improvements,” said
Myers. “There’s still more difficul-

“Robin’s having a really nice
year,” Yohman said. *‘She’s one of
the top all-arounders in- the East.”
Yohman just added a second rota-
tion to one of Senior’s ﬂoor routine
tumbling passes. The new element
“added another bonus point to her
routine.”

Senior’s performance was part of
an overall consistent effort for the
whole team.

Stevens had been out of the all-
around due to an injured ankle.
Asked about the injury, “It feels
strong,” Stevens said. “Now I want
to get my difficultyiback on the
floor.” ‘

Stevens executed her floor rou-
tine for the first-time this season.

She brought an extra “sting” mat
out to cushion the impact on her V

first tumbling pass. The routine
went without an error until the end.
Stevens ended up facing in the
wrong direction and did not com-
plete the final seconds of her pro-
gram’s choreography.

“She was not quite ready with the
new routine,” said Yohman. “Yet, I
knew with the tumbling that she
would be a score for us.” Stevens

Pitt track freshman, Smith, leads team at WVU

By Geoff Moak
Staﬁ Writer

There’s a new kid on the block

in the Pitt track and ﬁeld circles.

Actually, Trecia Smith has quietly
been having a monster freshman
season, but her performances
have often been overshadowed
by Najuma Fletcher, the “other”
superstar on Pitt’s team. Last
Saturday, at the Brooks Classic at
West Virginia University, Smith

finally had the spotlight all to her-.

self.

Smith won the triple jump by.

nearly five feet with a jump of
41-3. That is the second best
jump in the East this season,
behind only Fletcher. With her

jump, Smith qualified for the,

NCAA championships in the
event. Pitt’s Gennifer Washington
was a distant second in the triple
jump with 36-9. '

J Smith also had an outstanding
performance in the long jump,
leaping 19-5, the sixth best jump
of the season in the East, but only
the second best jump of the meet.
West Vuginia’s Pat Itanyi jumped
20-6 1/4, putting her in second
place in the East.

With nobody else to steal the
show, Pitt Head Coach Steve
Lewis gave most of his praise to
Smith. .

“We have anew potential star

rising,” Lewis said. “Smith just

had a great day. She’s the biggest
story we have going on now.”

In addition to her performances
Saturday, Smith was already
ranked seventh in the East in the

-high jump, sixth in thevshotput

and ﬁfth in the pentathlon.
The Panthers’ main goal as a

’ team was accomplished Saturday

when the women’s distance med-
ley relay -team qualiﬁed for the
ECAC championships behind
Angie Martin’s 3/4 mile leg and
the mile leg of Amy Francy. The
team’s time of 12:18.2 was good
for second place behind West
Virginia.

“It was important for us to get
it qualiﬁed. That’s more scoring
potential for us in the ECAC
meet,” Lewis said.

Allof Pitt’s relay teams have
now qualiﬁed for their respective

championship meets. The focus

will be on getting the most points
from each of them, so despite the
performance of the women’s
DMR, Lewis may shufﬂe the
lineup before the ECAC meet.
Lewis was less pleased with
the men’s shuttle hurdle relay
team, though he declined to say
exactly why. They finished in
second place with a time of 30.14
seconds, but that was nearly 1.5
seconds, an eternity by track starr-
dards, behind West Virginia.

blew it. We just made a mistake
that I’d rather not talk about. Our
guys are tough. They’ll be back.”
Individually, Pitt’s Jay Murphy
and Orrel Green did well on the
hurdles. Murphy posted Pitt’s
fastest time so far this year in the
55-meter hurdles, 7.53 seconds.
The top collegiate runner at the

meet, Murphy ﬁnished in third

place overall behind two unat-
tached runners. Green was not far
behind. His time of 7.67 put him

in sixth place overall.

In anticipation of some big
upcoming meets, many‘ Pitt ath-
letes did not compete in West
Virginia.
