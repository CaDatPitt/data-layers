Pitt deals with alcohol-related death

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

James Cox, alcohol specialist
for Pitt’s counseling depart-
ment, said that the lethal level
of alcohol could range any-
where from .4 to .6 percent.

After celebrating his 21st
birthday, Pitt student Atif
Bhatti’s blood alcohol level was
.474 percent.

He died of chronic alcohol
overdose, pending further
investigation by the Allegheny
county coroner’s office.

Bhatti’s death is not an isolat-
ed incident on college campus-
es. A student at Virginia Tech
University died four hours after
drinking a 32-ounce bottle of
tequila in a 15 minutes in 1991.

“He was a l9—year-old—stu-
dent majoring in Electrical

Engineering,” said Betty
Hayben, editior—in-chief of the
Collegiate Times, the student
newspaper at Virginia Tech.
The Vice President for
Student Affairs at Virginia
Tech, Tom Goodale, said the
student was at an off-campus
party and no one around him
tried to make him stop drinking.

SEAC demands recycling improvements

When freshman Sharon Praissman walks to the
trash room in Tower A, she intends to throw her
Coke can into the aluminum bin and her paper
into the paper bin.

But when she looks down and sees aluminum
products mixed with other trash, she surrenders
her recycling effort.

“I try, but if it’s all together anyway, I just
throw it all in,” Praissman said.

Pitt currently has separate bins for aluminum

3 and for other trash in its residence halls, but

members of Students for Enviromnental Action
Coalition said there are still some serious glitches

' in Pitt’s recycling program. Students will make

more of an effort to separate their trash if Pitt

Resident Student Association discussed their
recycling concerns yesterday with Robert
Hopkins, director of housing, and Gil Schaeffer,
assistant general manager for housing support
services. _ .

Hopkins said Pitt will improve its recycling
program by‘ making separate recycling bins in the
residence halls more visible and more accessible.

SEAC members had met with representatives
of housing services twice before in the last two
weeks to discuss ﬂaws in the implementation of
Pitt’s recycling program in the residence halls.
They suggested that Pitt put clearer labels on the
bins at the outside collection sites and inside

With the help of a guest
speaker, tensions between
Pitt’s Black Action Society
and Hillel have begun to dis-
sipate.

African—American Jewish
writer Jeannine Amber dis-
cussed her experiences while
growing up and how she
dealt with the cultural differ-
ences in her background.

After her lecture on
Sunday, she held a luncheon
with various student and
community leaders during
which she discussed current
relations between African
Americans and Jews.

Student Government Board
member Eric McKinley, who
organized the luncheon, said
the primary purpose of the
discussion was to clear the
air between BAS and Hillel,
the Jewish student organiza-
tion at Pitt.

“The basic point of the
luncheon was to find an
agenda intersection between
the two groups so they could
sit down and work together,”
said Eric McKinley.

While the meeting focused
on these student groups,
McKinley saidrthe discus-
sion could serve as an exam-
ple for all students groups.

“It showed how student
groups in general can reach
out to one another and find
some kind of common
ground so the university
doesn’t seem like sepa-
ratists,” said McKinley.

At last night's SGB, meet-

_ ing, Mc-Kinley said he was

pleased with the turnout at
Amber’s lecture, which was
close to 75 students, and was
happy with the outcome ‘of
the luncheon.

Amber speaks about importance of cultural diversity

By Linda Wisniewski
Staff Writer

Two completely different
cultures came together on
Sunday night in an effort to
break down the barriers of

stereotypes that exist in our

world.

Jeannine Amber, a free-
lance writer from New York
City, is an African American,
Jewish woman who says that
we have a lot of work ahead of
us if we are ever going to be
able to abolish, or at least
reduce the widespread bigotry
in our society.

As part of the programs in
celebration of Black Week ‘94,
the lecture was also co-spon-
sored by Hillel, the Jewish

Community Relations
Council, the Pitt Student
Government Board

Multicultural Committee and
by a grant from the Ethel Stept

Social Awareness Lectureship
Endowment Fund of the
United Jewish Federation
Foundation.

“To see people as humans,
you have to see them as com-
plicated, and that is not what is

going on here,” she said.

WASHINGTON — An air-

small planes because they
have a higher accident rate
than larger jets.

The International Airline
Passengers Association said
yesterday that between the

with fewer than 31 seats had
more fatal accidents than
medium-sized and large

look out for somebody else,”
Goodale said. “Alcohol is a
mood—altering chemical. It is a

drug.”

Cox said it depends on body
size when determining the
amount of alcohol that could

. kill someone. According to

Public Safety Director Rick
Boyd, Bhatti weighed 135
pounds.

“I was shocked, but not totally
shocked, because I have seen
students that abuse alcohol,”
Cox said, about Bhatti’s death.

“I was very sad and very dis-
appointed because this death
was unnecessary. But I was not
surprised,” said Michael Kaizar,
the president of the Student
Anti—Alcohol Movement.

Pitt has initiated a special

campus—wide task force to try
“and reduce the severity of the
problem of alcohol abuse,”
according to Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor.
\ In 1974 when Goodale
worked at the University of
Florida, he co~founded BAC-
CHUS, an acronym that he said
stands for Boost Alcohol
Consciousness Concerning the
Health of University Students.

“We have about 700 chapters
in the United States, Canada
and Mexico,” Goodale said.
“It’s probably the largest student
organization of its kind in the
country.”

Dr. Bob Gallagher of the

counseling center is in charge of
forming the task force at Pitt.

“Before this incident hap-
pened, Dr. Haley had asked me.
to begin putting together an
alcohol abuse task force,”
Gallagher said.

Gallagher cited a book titled  

Alcohol on Campus, by Donald
Gehring and Christie T. Geraci,
written in 1989.

“College students as a group
are heavy drinkers,” wrote
Geraci and Gehring. “Alcohol
consumption has long been a
part‘ of the collegiate experi~
ence.”

Boyd said alcohol affects the
brain in stages [and] before the
body will allow you to poison
yourself you will pass out.

“Virtually, the only way that

someone is going to overdose
on alcohol is if they chug alco-
hol,” Boyd said.

Cox and Kaizar agreed that
there can be peer pressure
involved when students drink
alcohol.

“I do hear quite a bit of
stories from students involving
pressure [to drink],” Cox
said.

‘‘I think there’s incredible
pressure to drink to give the
members [of a fraternity] a rea-
son to be a member,” Kaizar
said.

ANOTHER 1st AT THE “O”!

Kaizar said he hopes students
will learn from this incident.

“People always say, ‘It’ll
never happen to me.’ I certainly
hope [the death] will make stu-
dents think.”

Goodale added that students
need to control their alcohol
drinking.

“I’ve been working in this
field for 25 years, and we just
have not been able to put alco-
hol in it’s right place.”

Schaeffer’s staff had also paint-

Schaeffer said his staff will
work through each residence
hall, painting the walls behind
the bins, and placing labels on
the walls that designate the pur-
pose of each bin.

SEAC member Matt Peters
said he would also like “to see

other so that people just cannot

Each recycling bin should sit
next to a regular trash can,
Curry said. Students then can
separate their trash at one place
and will not have to walk to the
other side of the room or build-
ing to drop off different types of
trash.

Inside bins should also have
different types of lids. _A lid for
an ‘aluminum can’ bin should
have an opening that only an
aluminum can could fit
through, Peters said.

Schaeffer said he will order

bins like that.

Some students think that trash
all ends up together regardless
of whether they separate it or
not, said George Kline from
RSA.

-SEAC member Michael
Kaizar said he saw a trash col-
lector from A. J. Phillips
Hauling Co., Pitt’s contracted
hauler, mix cardboard with the
rest of the garbage outside
Lothrop Hall Wednesday night.

According to Act 101, which
outlines Pennsylvania’s recy-
cling laws, cardboard should

remain separate.

“I went up and watched the
loading dock and watched him
throw all the garbage in there,
and then he got a big dumpster
of cardboard and dumped the
entire thing in the trash truck,”
Kaizar said.

But the driver said the dump-
ster was contaminated, which
means that other types of trash
had already been mixed in
when he picked it up, said A.
Phillips, owner of A.J. Phillips
Hauling Co. Inc. When trash is
already contaminated, the col-

lectors do not have to separate
it, he said. _

Schaeffer said Pitt has sepa-
rate outside bins for recyclable
materials, but sometimes people
come from off the street and
mix trash in with the recycling
bins, therefore contaminating
them.

Schaeffer said he talked to A.
Phillips and said he will watch
the situation closely.

“We’re evidently going to
have to police a lot closer,”
Schaeffer said.

sity could not say, ‘If you put
this in this bin, it’s going to be
recycled,”’ said Knauer said.

The university’s recycling
program should get to the point
where Pitt can guarantee that
everything put into the recy-
cling bins will be recycled, he
said.

Also at yesterday’s meeting,
Hopkins opposed the charge
that Pitt has failed to comply
with Pennsylvania State Act
101. SEAC made this charge in
the recycling proposal the
group gave to Hopkins.

Hopkins said in some areas
Pitt should improve its compli-
ance, but it does meet the basic

requirements of Act 101. The

basic requirements are to pro-
vide separate bins for card-
board, paper and aluminum.

The city doesn’t have the per-
sonnel to monitor compliance
to Act 101, said Rosanne
Casciato, assistant director for
the Department of Public
Works. But the commercial
hauler Pitt contracts must sub-
mit a report that breaks down
the tonnage it picks up every
year.

According to a report submit-
ted to Pitt on March 18, 1994,
A.J. Phillips Hauling Co. Inc.
picked up 2,514.22 tons of rub-
bish and 95.6 tons of recyclable
material last year. The amount
of recyclable materials is more
than 25 times less than the
amount thrown away, Kaizar
said.

Act 101 does not mandate
how many tons of recyclable
materials should be picked up,
but “if [Pitt] had a full recycling
program going, they would be
recycling a lot more,” Kaizar
said.

Hopkins said he will look at
SEAC’s proposals more closely
and will meet with them again.
The proposals are broken up
into immediate, short-term and
long-term concerns.

According to the proposal,
immediate concerns include
clearer markings for recycling
bins. Short-term concerns
include going beyond Act 101
requirements by implementing
glass and newspaper recycling
programs. The long-term con-
cern is to “establish the
University of ‘Pittsburgh in an
environmentally conscious role
in the Pittsburgh community.”

Toward the end of the meet-
ing Hopkins held up a sticker
that had been posted across
campus. It said, “Pitt Lies!”"and
had a line through arrows sym-
bolizing recycling, implying
that Pitt doesn’t recycle.

Posting the sticker on signs
and on trash cans on campus is
“a particularly inappropriate
action for individuals who pro-
claim the values of recycling,”
Hopkins said.

SEAC had nothing to do with
the stickers and “in no way sup-
ports vandalism,” Curry said.

Hopkins said he will try to
find the individual(s) responsi-
ble, adding that he is relieved
that SEAC members did not
post the stickers.

"She said she always had

She said she never really knew

She said she was looked at
differently because people did
not understand how she could
be both black and Jewish.

“You don’t get,press for

theorizing why she thinks the

attention than if a white person
does it.‘

She said the Nation of Islam
does not scare her because
they are not violent like the

“They have an agenda for

“These people scare me.”

“You will be shocked and

Wake up call

The death of Atif Bhatti has sent shock waves through Pitt’s
campus. Bhatti died Friday morning of alcohol poisoning, two
days after drinking 16 shots in less than an hour while celebrat-
ing his Zlst birthday. An honors student on his way to medical
school, Bhatti had everything to live for. His death is an unfor-
tunate tragedy.

There are many .lessons to be drawn from this incident. We
have all heard the horror stories of drinking, but most often
those horrors involve drunk driving or sexual assault. This
incident should serve as a wake up call to all of us, especially
men. I

For women there is always the added danger in getting drunk
of being taken advantage of, and this is a danger most women
are very conscious of. But for men, as long as you don’t drive,
the perceived danger is not that great. Everyone has heard sto-

- ries, or had experiences themselves — but what was the worst

that ever happened? A really bad hangover? Or perhaps you
passed out at a party and pissed your pants? These might have
been embarrassing and painful experiences, but they certainly
were not life—threatening. Now that has changed. Atif Bhatti’s
death is not merely a horror story, but a reality.

We all should have a greater awareness of the potential life-
threatening dangers of alcohol, especially to those who do not
have that great of a body mass. Bhatti weighed only about 135
pounds, according to Rick Boyd, public safety director. If/he
weighed 235, he probably would not be dead right now. These
are things people must think about, and hopefully the next time
someone is egging someone on to have another drink, they will
remember what can happen if you drink one too many.

Drinking is as much a part of college life as football, perhaps
even more so. Not everyone does it‘, but a significant number
do. There is nothing wrong with drinking, but it should be
done responsibly. Bhatti’s death and the recent sexual assault
serve as reminders of what can happen if drinking is not done
responsibly. V

As for the university administration, The Pitt News recom-
mends that it treat this incident with moderation and not to
make any radical changes in response. However, there is one
change which we suggest and that is the inclusion of alcohol
awareness in the Freshman Studies courses. The majority of
freshmen take this course, which generally serves as an intro-
duction to the university. A class is taught on sexual assault,
which includes a discussion of alcohol; however there is not a
class dedicated to alcohol awareness. We suggest dedicating

’ one class to alcohol awareness, with a expert guest speaker.

How much good this will actually do is hard to tell, but you
can never go wrong by providing information to the students.

The Pitt News expresses our condolences to Atif Bhatti’s
family. This is an unfortunate tragedy, but hopefully we can
learn from it so that similar tragedies do not occur in the
future.

A|umni's view

As a graduate of Pitt who
has begun his career in engi-
neering, I am very interested
in the various projects that
Pitt is undertaking, both
social and scientific. I would
like to see Pitt progress into
the world class university
that it has the capability of
becoming. However, there
are a number of indications
that Pitt is in serious danger
of becoming a “second-rate
school with first-rate prices”
if it continues to conduct its
administrative affairs in a
draconian, sophomoric fash-
ion. As an alumnus, I cannot
donate money to a school
that at least does not attempt
to represent my views and
beliefs in an equitable man-
ner. I" am not the only one.
This is evident with the
recent business school fund-
raising fiasco. Our chancellor
seemed to_ take the arrogant
position that alumni were not
seeing the “big picture” by
their failure to donate their
hard—earned money to the
paws of the Panther. Quite to
the contrary, they see the
extravagant mismanagement
of school resources to
advance certain individuals
and programs that have dubi-
ous educational merit.

Secondly, student leaders
and the SGB continue
to wrangle over the student
activities budget. Over
my four years at Pitt,
the SGB has consistently
taken a rather condescending
attitude toward students
that did not “get involved
on campus” and tended
to overcompensate groups
that really did nothing

other than to raise the collec- -

tive blood pressure of
the campus. Such an attitude
is appalling. Instead of

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

trying to build bridges, Pitt
student leaders like to
advance questionable agen-
das that very few people sup-
port. If you don’t go along
with these programs, of
course, you are branded
“insensitive,” and your views
need changed. While you
may be able to hold this over
another student’s head, it is
quite impossible to browbeat
alumni into donating vast
monetary resources to your
school.

The university’s best
approach is to show alumni
why it is in their best inter-
ests to donate to this school.
Right now, Pitt subscribes to
the belief that cultural diver-
sity is more important than
academic excellence, and
where you came from is far
more important than where
you are going. I would sus-
pect that the Pennsylvania
taxpayers (who subsidize
Pitt’s projects) and the
majority of Pitt graduates
hold contrary views. More
projects are in jeopardy until
this school realizes the grave
consequences of their short-
sightedness.

Cultural center

Only after wading through
almost all of Michael S.
Barge’s article on the
Stephen Foster Memorial did
I ascertain the true goal of
the author: to use the exis-
tence of the statue to pressure
the University of Pittsburgh
into funding the construction
of an African Cultural
Center.

I certainly do not have any
objections to the existence of
such a center. What I do

object to, however, is the
university funding its con-
struction. If Pitt were to
announce that it was building
an exclusive club for, say,
Native Americans (who have
suffered just as much as, if
not more than, African-
Americans), the opposition
would be . formidable.
However, this is exactly what
the African Cultural Center
would be: a “members only”
club for black students.

Members of the Black
Action Society have already
responded to this argument
by stating that the center
would be freely open to stu-
dents of all races. However if
other black students (who
would assumedly be the pri-
mary users of such a facility)
share the obvious vehemence
towards white people (the
“evil oppressors”) that Mr.
Barge displays in his article,
I sincerely doubt that any
Caucasian student would feel
comfortable or welcome in
the African Cultural Center.

Any money spent by Pitt
should go toward the benefit
of all students, not just a
select few — no matter how
loudly they complain or what
tactics they employ. If Pitt
wants to build a cultural cen-
ter, it should build a cultural
center dedicated to all races
and cultures. But if the mem-
bers of the Pitt Black Action
Society (already the highest
funded student organizations)
and the black student com-
munity in general want to
build an African Cultural
Center for their own use.
then they should raise the
money to build it by them-
selves.

The Pitt News, Tuesday, November 15, 1994

Columnist shares liberal viewpoint on politics

ether or not having an opin-
ion on politics is a good thing
or not remains to be seen,

especially given the overwhelming con-
servative majority on the Opinions page.
Now, normally I despise politics —
thinking, talking, writing about it makes
me ill —— but I feel a bit left out since
that’s all my colleagues seem to care
about. I also feel the liberal side of the
spectrum is getting a bit neglected.

I am proud to say that I am a “bleed-
ing-heart liberal.” There’s nothing wrong
with being liberal. There’s nothing
wrong with being conservative. In fact, I
think there’s way too much emphasis on
party divisions. No one is necessarily
“wrong” in any political scenario, it’s
more that some people are more correct
than others.

Liberal people believe in socially cur-
ing the masses. Conservatives believe in

curing the individual, socially that is.
This is what 20 years of growing up in a
split-party household has taught me. I
don’t claim to be an expert on political
parties, but constant exposure to a
Republican and Democrat together has
showed me that no one is right, every-
thing is relative.

One might think that I would be con-
servative, but I’m not. There are more
issues that I disagree with conservative
people on, i.e. abortion, capitol punish-
ment, crime, euthanasia, etc, so I decided
to agree with liberals. These aren’t fun-
damental aspects of my every day life.
They are, much more simply, ideas and
beliefs I have formed based on experi-
ence, talking with others, and the reading
of people who supposedly are educated
in the ﬁeld of politics.

I think the fatal mistake made by both
parties, and government in general, is

politicians try to legislate morality. This
is virtually impossible, mainly because
everyone has their own idea of what is
morally right and wrong, hopefully. The
masses will eventually retaliate when
pressed too hard.

I suppose that is my biggest problem
with the Republican Party -— they seem
to shove morality down everyone’s
necks. Prayer in school, family values
(which I never understood), political
character, etc, all say to me they are
wasting their time. They are trying to
achieve the impossible, and will
inevitably fail.

Everyone has their own remedy for the
sickness ailing our country, yet no one
knows how to implement it.

People in general, parties aside, are
simply too impatient concerning politics.
Everyone expects a “quick fix” to every
social problem. This is impossible, espe-

7

cially with our slow—moving political
process. Given a chance, I think most
presidents could have made a real differ-
ence (with a few glaring exceptions), but
either were publicly destroyed by the
media, or were not given a chance
because of Congress or something.

With all the personal hang-ups people
have on public figures’ personal lives,
it’s a wonder some people don’t demand
the word “God” be taken off the dollar
bill because God hasn’t parted the
Mississippi River, or something. Maybe
we should all calm down and take a deep
breath. No one’s perfect; did you hear
me politically obsessed people out there?
Those who voted for Ollie North and
Jesse Helms? NO ONE IS PERFECT.
Not even Harry Truman.

News.

Stephen Foster

As curator of the Stephen
Foster Memorial, and as an
educator and historian, I am
pleased to respond to
Michael S. Barge’s opinion
editorial (Monday, Nov. 7,
1994), which asserted that
the “Stephen Foster
Memorial and statue [are]
and insult to blacks.”

The statue he described is
not part of the University of
Pittsburgh; it is owned by the
city~of Pittsburgh and stands
in the city’s Schenley Park.

Even if we disagree with the _

symbolism and connotations
of the visual imagery of the
statue, we must acknowledge
that as public sculpture it
reflects part of our communi-
ty's history. Whether the
sculptor intended it or not,
the statue embodies the racial
attitudes of people who
erected it in 1900, nearly a
century ago, during a period
of widespread enactments of
“Jim Crow laws” and lynch-
mob rule. Since that time we
have had a long and painful
battle against discrimination,
and that battle is not yet won.
The statue represents one
moment in that history,
before the great advances of
the Civil Rights Act, Equal
Opportunity Act and many
other victories in the 20th
century and our own life-
times.

We who are part of an
educational institution have
a responsibility to study
and understand the past,
and to help future genera-
tions learn from its mistakes
and its successes, so that
life can be illuminated by
knowledge, not clouded by
ignorance. We have wit-
nessed in this century the
systematic destruction and
misrepresentation of history,
especially in Nazi Germany
and the former Soviet Union.
So let us not adopt the reac-
tionary attitudes that call for
demolition of cultural arti-
facts, or other attempts to
cover up the historical record
and hide or ignore the atti-

tudes, thoughts or actions of
earlier times that we repudi-
ate today.

The statue DOES indeed
misrepresent blacks. The
Stephen Foster Memorial has
participated in scholarly
studies that have documented
this. But viewers should be
aware that the statue ALSO
misrepresents its intended
honoree, Stephen Collins
Foster. It is a fiction to depict
him seated on a rock above
an African American musi-
cian (“Uncle Ned”), or copy-
ing onto paper (and steal-
ing?) the music he heard a
musician perform; there is no
evidence that he ever saw
himself as a superior white
male, or a black man as infe-
rior. The statue is, in fact,
quite possibly the opposite of
how Stephen Foster would
have viewed himself. It mis-
treats both the white song-
writer and black musician.
But it does represent how its
sponsors and donors thought
a century ago. The statue is a
depiction of the public mem-
ory of that time, not of
Foster’s lifetime nor of our
own; we don’t have to agree
with it, but we should under-
stand it. _

Foster was, in fact, the first
songwriter to try to reform
the American entertainment
industry’s degrading images
of African Americans. He
said that he wished to get
“refined” (middle- and
upper—class European
American) society in the
1850s to have compassion
and pity for the subjects of
his minstrel songs, who were
people forced to live as
slaves. He warned performers
that these tragic songs should
be done as comedy. And he
gradually persuaded some
performers to drop the dialect
and the offensive depictions
of African Americans on
stage.

The first of Foster’s songs
in which audiences recog-
nized anti-slavery sentiments
was, ironically, “Uncle Ned,”
published in 1848. To readers
a century and a half later the

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR S

words seem derogatory, but
they were written when
America was a very different
place. This was the first song
written for minstrel perform-
ers in which a black man
“emerges  as a gentle, kind-
ly human being. This song is
an elegy,” according to popu-
lar-song historian Charles
Hamm of Dartmouth
University.

The first popular song that
depicts an African American
man and woman as faithful
husband and wife is Foster’s
“Nelly Was A Lady,” pub-
lished in 1849. It was alone
one of the earliest publica-
tions that seriously called an
African American woman a
lady, a term reserved for
European and European
American women of
the highest class. Other songs
in this series to depict
African Americans as people
of dignity were “Old Folks
at Home” (“Swanee River”),
“My Old Kentucky
Home” and “Old Black
Joe.” These songs were
not written, as Mr. Barge
asserts, to “glorify the ante-
bellum South and its system
of legal and constitutional
terrorism,” although postbe1-
lum culture has interpreted
them that way. They were
written to evoke compassion
for a race of people that most
northerners had never
encountered, and some music
historians would argue that
they did more to bring about
emancipation than any other
body of literature, written or
sung.

There is much more to the
story of how Stephen Foster
sought to change America, to
alter the mass-culture notion
of African Americans from
that of chattel or buffoon to
one of fully human beings,
with the same capacity for
affection, hope, dreams, spir-
ituality, dignity and noble
spirit that people of any other
ethnic origin may have. The
Stephen Foster Memorial 
includes a research library —
one of the most important
ones for 19th century

American music — where
students, teachers and the
general public can review
this material for themselves.
We welcome and encourage
the active use of the original
materials by the students and
faculty of Africana Studies
and other departments.
During the past decade, the
memorial has sponsored
research, teaching and public
programs, focused in part on
Foster’s music in antebellum
America and in later genera-
tions, digging beyond the
negative and unbalanced
stereotypes about him that
have been so widely circulat-
ed in the mid-20th century.
The memorial hosts school
groups and tours, offers lec-
tures, classes, radio and tele-
vision interviews and pub-
lishes articles, to try to get
this message across to
students and the public.
The curator has worked
with the American
Association of Blacks in

Energy, with members of.

Pitt’s former Black Studies
Department and the History
Department, with the Center
of Black Music Research and
other organizations in this
effort. As part of the univer-
sity, the memorial is an ally
in the battle to combat racism
and discrimination, andto
help bring about equality and
justice. But this battle must
be fought through open and
honest research and educa-
tion, not through the reac-
tionary and systematic
destruction of selected cul-
tural artifacts and the histori-
cal need.

Dr. Deane L. Root, curator

Marion Barry

I would like to take this
opportunity to express my
compliance with the opinion
of the editorials of the last
few weeks or so. The opin-
ions seemed -to be well
thought out. With the elec-
tions now only a day old, I
expected to see a slew of
information about the

turnouts — the Republicans
taking over, now looking for-
ward to ‘96. But nothing.
This comes as a big disap-
pointment to me. The
Pitt News editorial board is
usually on top of things. In

.a way I am kind of happy

The Pitt News didn’t publish
anything about the elections.
There was enough on the
TV to make you sick,
thank you for sparing the
university community the
boredom.

There is one thing that
strikes me as odd. Out of all
the national and state gover-
norships being talked about
on the tube last night, ther
was no mention of the re-
election of the former
District of Columbia Mayor
Marion Barry. The editors of
The Pitt News I am shocked
at you as well. ’

Marion Barry, who was set
up by the government, con-
victed of drug use and spent
time in prison, received no
air play. I am a resident of
D.C. and a member of the
Democratic Party, and I do
not support the re-election of
Marion Barry. He stands for
a lot to the people of
Washington, D.C., a lot I
don’t understand. It’s as

-though he is some kind of

superhero who can solve the
city’s problems in a single
term.

The mayor who took office
after his problems with the
law had to tackle the prob-
lems Barry left her with. The
problems weren’t corrected
in his four years away from
office, remember these are
the problems he left, so what
makes the residents of D.C.
feel he can correct the prob-
lems he had no strategy for
tackling in his previous 12
years of office?

I am interested in reading
what The Pitt News has to
say about this issue. Do we
comply here as well?

Mar-

finally
made his
decision.
The
preseason
Columnist Heisman tro-
Keith phy candi-
Pompey date, who
only played
in the first
two games of this season
due to an ankle injury,
decided to end his football
career at Pitt after this sea-
son.

Martin’s decision was one
of the hottest topics in the
Pittsburgh area.

Some people said he

 

didn’t have anything else to A

prove on the collegiate
level.

Others felt if he didn’t
stay, no professional team
in their right mind would
draft him.

His teammates even got
into the debate. Defensive
end Zetti Moody said, “If
Martin came back for
another season, he was 100
percent sure Pitt would play
in a bowl game next year.”

Well, that might be true,
but for now Martin will
always be remembered for
leadership role on the field.

Do you remember last
year when he rushed 206
yards against Syracuse?

How about that time when
his 80-yard touchdown run
decided the outcome of the
Temple game, which Pitt
won 28-18 a year ago.

You can’t forget the first
game of this season; he
rushed for 251 yards versus
Texas.

Regardless of whether or
not Martin makes it in the
NFL, he did it all for Pitt.

“Curtis Martin is one of
those marquee players who
reminds you of so many of
the great players who
played for Pitt over the
years,” said West Virginia
coach Don Nehlen in the
Pitt Media Guide. “He’s a
north—south guy, and he
makes great cuts —— a very
special back. Obviously,
you don’t want to give him
a chance to show what he
can do.”

Syracuse coach Paul
Pasqualoni added, “Martin
is one of the most elusive,
productive tailbacks we
have faced. He’l1 earn his
place among the most elite
ball carriers that have come
out of Pittsburgh.”

These are very high prais-
es for a guy who first
played football in the 12th

eligible to receive a medical
redshirt for next season, but
declined.

‘Majors said Martin didn’t
give any specific reason for
leaving.

“It was his gut feeling,”
Majors said.

“Sometimes I go with my
gut feeling. Sometimes it’s
been good, and a few times
it’s been bad.”

The 6-foot, 200-pound
Martin received advice from

 

Majors and professional
scouts to play a fifth year to
prove he can play a season
injury-free.

“That’s his decision,”
Majors said. “I advised him
that I thought it wasn’t a
good decision before.”

His elusiveness and ability
to change directions in a
split second landed him the
nickname “Cutback” Curtis
and ultimately made Martin
Pitt’s fifth a1l—time leading
rusher with 2,643 yards.

Fans’ last memory of
Martin at Pitt Stadium was a
record—breaking one.

In the season opener
against Texas and the only
full game he participated
this year, Martin exploded
for 251 yards, the most
Texas has yielded in its
illustrious football history.

go on to break Martin’s
mark.

However, Martin says he’s
ready to play against
Rutgers this weekend.

game plan for the Rutgers
game,” Majors said.

distraction, and I don’t think
it’s a distraction from my

The NCAA rule for players

Pi ft '5 five -point loss
encourages Ma/ors

By Matt Groﬂ‘
Senior Staff Writer

After Pitt’s 17-12 loss to No. 5
Miami, head coach Johnny
Majors said nobody in the locker
room was happy about the
gaIne’s outcome.

“We thought we could win,”
Majors said.

Majors’ statement may be true,
especially since a win would
have given Pitt one of the top
upsets of the year and knocked
Miami out of the hunt for a
national championship.
However, as the Panthers’ 1994
season winds down, nobody can

deny the positive impact this I

ﬁve-point loss in the Hurricanes’
Orange Bowl will have on the
Pitt football team and its faithful
supporters.

‘This was the most encourag-
ing performance of my two years
here,” Majors said. “I don’t know
if I’ve ever had a team give a bet-
ter effort in my entire career.”

First and foremost, Pitt running
back Billy West’s performance
silenced any doubters of his abili-
ty who said his Big East leading
statistics are the result of a high
volume of carries against soft
teams. West, who has filled in for
the injured Curtis Martin since
the Sept. 10 Ohio University
game, proved his case by gaining
160 yards on 34 carries, averag-
ing nearly five yards per carry
against the best defense, statisti-
cally, in college football.

“We had an idea that we could
run the ball if we kept it between
the tackles,” West said. “Miami

has such a great defense mnning
side to side because of their
speed.”

Prior to the Pitt game, the
speedy Hurricanes limited their
opponents to less than 90 yards
per game rushing. Miami was
coming off a Virginia Tech game
in which they gave up minus 14
yards, its third straight game of
limiting opponents to less than
50 yards on the ground.

West’s performance made him
the only running back to have

gained more than 100 yards.

against the Hurricane defense
this year. The last player to gain
more than 150 against the ‘Canes

Piﬂ hockey slips again, 4-29

By Tom Schneider
Staﬂ Writer

“Anything that can go wrong

usually will.” —— Murphy’s
Law, as it pertains to the game
of hockey.

It’s something that the Pitt
Hockey Club should know
_ painfully
\ well after
its 4-2
loss to
Carnegie-
Mellon in
t h e
WPCHA
opener
for both teams on Friday night.
The Panthers entered the
game fully expecting to leave
with a victory, and it wasn’t
hard to see why. They out-
worked, outmuscled and basi-
cally outplayed the Tartans for
the entire game.

quicksand, however, it’s any-
body’s game.

The unseasonably warm
weather on Friday made the ice
surface at Golden Mile Ice
Arena feel more like a giant
Sno-Cone. The Panthers, whose
goal—scoring is built on quick
rushes and timing, could not
adapt

“The ice was just a huge fac-

tor in the game,” Hockey Club
president Matt White said. “It
was very soft and slow, and our
scoring punch is built for when
the ice is fast and hard.

“The ice was choppy, pucks
were bouncing all over and it
was hard to make good passes.”

The slow ice took away Pitt’s
speed advantage, and the
uneven surface produced a few
unfortuitous bounces for the
Panthers, some leading to costly
CMU goals.

The Panthers and Tartans
traded goals through the first

two periods of play, with Pitt’s
Bill Elliott and Carter Leonards
scoring to keep the two teams at
an even keel.

Midway through the final
period, a loose puck was
bounced around near the
Panther goal and somehow
found its way into the net with
what appeared to be a bank shot
off the goalie’s mask.

That ﬂuke goal proved to be
the backbreaker for the
Panthers, and CMU finished off
the scoring with another baf-
fling goal on a quick shot
directly off a faceoff.

Despite the 4-2 loss and
inauspicious start to the 1994-
_95 WPCHA season, White and
the Panthers are not at all wor-
Iied.

“Everything [within the game
plan] looked really good,”
White said. ‘The timing was
on, and we were making a lot of

tance coach Mark Schwartz
said.

The stand-out runner has
led the Pitt team with top fin-
ishes all year.

“Mike is a class act,”
Schwartz said. “I can’t say
enough about Mike, he’s a
great guy.”

The finish of teammates
Dennis Kuntz and Ed
Adamson helped the Panther
team finish 21st overall.

“I thought the first three
guys did very well,’’
Schwartz said.

For Adamson, the meet

proved to be disappointing.

According to Pitt’s coach;
he tripped during the race and
suffered a hip pointer.

Yet, it was his determina-
tion that kept him running, as
he finished the race with a
time of 32:14.

Finishing just ahead of
Adamson with a time of
31:50 was Kuntz.

“For Dennis, this run‘ was

his personal best,” Schwartz

said.

On the other hand, it was
the recurring theme of inex-
perience that resulted in a
31st-place finish for the

women at the ECAC.

Another year—1ong theme
has been the leadership of
sophomore Angie Martin,
who finished in 50th place
with a time of 18:23.

“She started out good and
she came on hard at the fin-
ish,” Schwartz said.

The second-place finish on
the team was Stacey
Anderson, a performance that
impressed her coach.

“She did very well,”
Schwartz said. “It was a per-
sonal best for her.”

Rounding out the women’s
team were freshman Amy

Francy (20:14), sophomore
Stephanie Ellsworth (20:16)
and junior Melanie Ishman
(20:35).

Schwartz was encouraged
by the women’s performance.
The ECAC was a good expe-
rience for the women’s team,
and they will only get better
from here, Schwartz said.

Looking back on the team
as a whole, Schwartz is con-
fident for the future.

“We beat some good indi-
viduals and some good
teams. We’ll improve next
year.jIt’s been a successful
season.”

°From page 8

“This will not change our
game plan for the Rutgers
game,” Majors said.

“We hope it won’t be a
distraction, and I don’t think
it’s a distraction from my
point of view.”

Martin will practice this
week, but will be in a back-
up role to Billy West.

About whether Martin will
play, Majors says it’s “possi-
ble,” and he’ll decide during
the course of the game.

And as for Martin’s NFL
future: “I hope he has good
success,” Majors said.

hurt, which leaves Willard
with one option.

“Right now, the backup
point guard isa manager,” he
said. '

Adding to Pitt’s depth
woes, walk—on Jake Allen

That leaves the Panthers
with only two walk-ons, who
round off a skimpy 10-man
roster.

but the difference between this
year’s game and last year’s illus-
trates Majors’ statements
throughout the 1994 season that
Pitt’s improvements are showing
on the ﬁeld but not in its record.

Last year at Pitt Stadium, Pitt
faced a lesser Miami team and
was down three touchdowns 20
minutes after the coin ﬂip. When
the ﬁnal numbers were in, Miami
had won 35-7. The line on
Saturday’s game was 32 points, a
predicted margin of victory even
bigger than last year’s destruc-
tion.

Facing a Hurricane squad
which is making its case for the

national title, Pitt rose to the
occasion and followed its game
plan. A

“We came out and we execut-
ed our game plan almost to per-
fection,” Pitt quarterback John
Ryan said after the game.

If anyone should realize the
huge difference in this year’s
game, it is Ryan, who was sacked
nine times for a total of 56 yards
in last year’s contest.

This year, Ryan completed 10
passes in 17 attempts, with one
touchdown and no interceptions.

“We just needed to come up
with a big play at the end of the
game and we would have won,”
he said.

Hockey——

good passes that were just hard
to control because of the ice.

“This was just one of those
times when you say, ‘Oh, well,’
and look forward to the next
game.”

The Panthers finished the
weekend with a 9-4 pum-
melling of the Pittsburgh Junior
Stars on Saturday night. That
was their first victory of the
season, and the Panthers take a
1-4 record into next week’s
WPCHA showdown with
