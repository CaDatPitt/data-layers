Enlightenment, is a courage in which individual self-af-
firmation includes participation in universal, rational,

which affirms itself but the individual self as the bear-

According to Harold E. Hoel-
scher, dean of the School_of Engi-
neering, it is imperative that en-
gineers understand the social, po-
litical, and economic consequences
of their work.

Committed to this conviction,
Dean Hoelscher intends to expose
engineering students at the Uni-
versity to a “new dimension in en-
gineering education.”

Primary emphasis in the School
of Engineering will continue to be
on design and development, but a
new attention to the effects of en-
gineering projects will appear.

In a Pitt News interview, Dean
Hoelscher explained that through-
out history, engineering feats
have profoundly affected the so-
cial, political, and economic
makeup of nations, regions, and
the world. ‘

Recently, technological prog-
ress has been so rapid and its re-
percussions so significant that,

in Dean Hoelscher’s opinion, “the .

engineer can no longer ignore the
results of his work.”

Bolstering his contention with
allusions to the past, the balding
administrator discussed the ef-
fects of thechnological break-
throughts on conditions and atti-
tudes in America.

Various household devices have
lightened the workload of the
American woman, allowing her
free time in which to fight for so-
cial and political equality. ,

' The invention and perfection of
the washing machine for example,
has had a profound impact on the
social relationship of the sexes in
America.

The proliferation of automo-
biles, due in great part to techno-
logical progress, has also influ-
enced American society in many

\ ,-ways.

As mobility became real to all
Americans, traditional attitudes
towards job stability and the home
changed drastically.

With the past as a guide, it is a

_ ' fairly simple process to deter-
 mine what the effects of an engi-

neering project will be.

Applying the new approach to a
hypothetical case, Dean Hoelsch-
er cited the changes which the
construction of a power plant
would’ bring to an underdeveloped
nation.

First, the country’s economy

, would improve substantially, and

industrialization would most like-
ly proceed at a rapid pace.

Second, the nation’s class struc-
ture would be altered, as the
ranks of the wealthy and the mid-
dle class swelled.

Finally, the political power of
the nation would grow as econom-
ic progress led to military strengh
and political prestige.

“Before building a power

plant,” Dean Hoelscher conclud-

ed, “one ought to look at these ef-
fects to make sure what's going
to happen is desirable.”

Although the full force of Dean
Hoelscher’s “new dimension in en-
gineering education” will be felt
sometime in the future, one major
step has already been taken in this

field.

Recently, Dr. William Garrison
was appointed to the newly estab-
lished Edward R. Weidline Chair
of Environmental Engineering.

A geographer, an urbanologist,
and an engineer, Dr. Garrison will
relate the consequences of tech-
nology to technology itself and
help engineers to understand the
ramifications of their work.

Engineering students at the
University can expect to exposed
more and more to the new dimen-
sion Dean Hoelscher and many of
his colleagues consider so impor-
tant.

Dental School  
Instigates Change

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ
Staff Writer’

Revolutionary things are hap-
pening at the Dental School. A re--
vision in curriculum, implement-
ed last September at the Universi-
ty School of Dental Medicine, has
put into practice a system in
which students receive no grades,
tests do not count, and teachers
sometimes play it by ear.

The curriculum is divided into
four areas. Human Biology is
classical or basic science. Clinical
Biology and Technology is applied
knowledge, and is sometimes re-
lated to Human Biology. Methods
of Science teaches students how
to write reports, how to interpret
statistics, and how to read scienti-
fic journals. In Professional and
Social Perspectives, the student
learns about the role of dentistry-
in the community.

Under the new curriculum a sys-
tems rather than a subject ap-
proach is used. Systems (exam-
ple: the muscle system) are stud-
ied individuallys, with emphasis
on the anatomy, microanatomy,
physiology, pathology, pharma-

cology, and biochemistry of each
system.

Courses are coordinated so that
all teachers cover the same area
at the same time. Actually, what
teachers are doing is teaching the
same system from different points
of view. Some students find that
they are learning more, since they
can relate knowledge from all
their courses. ”

Exams are given, but they don’t
count for a grade. The purpose of
the exams is to see whether in-
structors are communicating the
material to the students. A com-
prehensive exam, given at the end
of each term, is designed to test
all aspects of the curriculum at
once.  ‘

TEST DATES FOR NATIONAL‘
TEACHER EXAMINATIONS

College seniors preparing to
teach school may take the Na- V
tional Teacher Examinations on
any of the four different test
dates annouced by Education-
al Testing Service, a nonprofit,
educational organization which
prepares and administers this
testing program.

New dates for the testing of,
prospective teachers are: Nov.
8, 1969, and Jan. 31, April
4, and July 18, 1970. The
test will be given at nearly 500
locations throughout the Unit-
ed States, ETS said.

TICKET SIZE

All tickets handled by the Pitt
Student Union Ticket Office
must be of professional size,
11/2" in 31/2”; The reason for
making this request is that the
professional ticket racks will
hold only that size tickets.

INFORMATION

The numbers for information
have been changed. The new
numbers for the information
Centers are 7191 and 7196.
The numbers ring in both the
SU and in the CL. It is hoped
that the increase in personnel
will providsbetter service to
the University community. To
coordinate the two lnformati.on
Centers, the Information Serv-
ices Office has been establish-
ed. This /new office will aid in
the wider dissemination of in-
formation. Also, the new office
publishes “Today in the Uni-
versity" and will authorize the
posting of signs.

  Hoelscher   Adds Dimension Liberal Arts Cabinet 

 

Discusses New Plans 

Chairman Mike Fabricant and
other members of the SG Liberal
Arts Cabinet (LAC) met Wednes-
day to discuss the goals of the cab-
inet for the coming year. Fabri-
cant announced that his primary
goal will be the re-establishment
of the Free University in the facil-
ities that have been provided by
the University in the Social Sci-
ences Building.

The members of the LAC dis-
cussed possible organization of a
student board to help oversee the
running of the Free University.
The discussion also involved pos-
sible coordination of the Univer-
sity.-based Free University with
the University City Ministries
Free University.

Fabricant mentioned investiga-
tion of the personal files on Uni-
versity students (which were sup-
posedly destroyed), careful consi-
deration of University expansion
into the surrounding community,
and a thorough examination of the
forthcoming report issued by a

in the near future.

It was emphasized throughout
the meeting that the LAC will at-
tempt to focus on one issue at a
time and carry that issue through
to its conclusion in order to
achieve its goals. Fabricant point-
ed out that this method was em-
ployed by Joe Kocuibes, last year's

tively bring about the many
changes instituted in the liberal
arts program.

The LAC spent a good deal of
its time discussing working with-
in the individual departments to
help the continuation of the typ
of innovative education that can
be obtained at the University. The
effectiveness of this within the
English and‘ psychology depart-
ments was mentioned. Though
many starts have been made to-
ward more viable departments,
Fabricantpointed out that much
research and discussion is need-
ed to create the type of dialogue
that will produce definitive re-
sults. A

 Editorial

“Courage to be as oneself, as this
is understood in the Enlightenment,
is a courage in which individual self-
affirmation includes participation in
universal, rational, self-affirmation.
Thus it is not the individual self‘ as
such which affirms itself but the
individual self as the bearer of reason.
The courage to be as oneself is the
courage to follow reason and to defy
irrational authority.” — Paul Tillich,
The Courage To-.Be

In the of mankind, very few,

‘if any, have‘ “shown the courage to
,_be as oneself. Thus, on this campus,
in the past year, very few, if any,
have shown the courage to be as one-

‘ self.
This . statement includes those
from the lowliest of freshmen to

the‘ highest of administrators. The
past year exposed followers -— follow-
ers of the left as well as of the
right. The past year exposed reac-
tionaries — on the left as well as on
the right.

In retrospect, The Pitt News dur-

I ing the past year showed very little,

if any, courage to be asitself. None
- of us followed reason nor defied irra-
tional authority.

As everyone else on this campus
and campuses across the world, we
. were caught up in the grand and glor-
ious ‘movement.’ Last year’s first is-
sue called for student power and

the freeing of the student as a ‘nig-
ger.’ We all sat in, protested, wrote
firey editorials; we all followed the
lead of our radical leaders.

But that was last year. This year
there will be no statement of poli-
tical position of The Pitt News, for
we will strive to allow all those on
this campus, who have a little cour-
age, to write what they want in their
paper.

Hopefully this year we will see
alittle courage from some others, too.

Many, people felt Chancellor
Posvar showed little courage to be as
himself last year. Although we un-
derstood his precarious position be-

tween the State Legislature and the I

Student body, we hope for more
courage in dealing with both this
year. That goes for the rest of the ad-
ministration, too.

Of. the entire University com-
munity, probably the faculty showed
the greatest lack of courage to be as
oneself last year. According to
Youth In Turmoil, the book compiled
by the Editors of Fortune Magazine,
the faculty is the strongest part of
the University community. “One part
of the University, the faculty, so over-
shadows the other three that there
can be no question of a power strug-
gle on broad questions of educational
character and policy” the book says. I
agree. All the student power and ad-

 

ministrative ultimatums aren’t «worth a
dime if the faculty doesn’t respond.
Last year, their sole expres-
sion of any semblence of courage
was the decision to abolish credit for
ROTC. That decision may well be
reversed by the Administration this
year. ‘

But in times of turmoil, change,
possibly even revolution, the major-
ity of the faculty showed little or no
courage to be as oneself. Almost all
either continued to hide behind the
facade of the grading system and the
lecture-reguritation type of classroom
situation or followed the example of
one or two "pioneers” and threw all
structure out the window. But from
neither did any origionality, genius,
or individualism stand out. Followers
of reason or defiers of irrational au-
thority they were not.

And, last but not least, the stu-
dents here showed very little courage to
be as themselves last year. .There
were long hairs and short hairs; left-
ists and rightists; activists; passi-
vists, conservatives and radicals; the
mass of apathetic students; but all show-
ed little or no courage to be as them-

i selves.

When I say apathetic, I don’t mean
students didn’t cheer at pep rallies
or vote in the Student Government
elections. I mean they never even ask-
ed themselves what the hell they were

 

  The Courage To Be As Oneself

doing. They didn’t even have the
courage to be as themselves with
themselves.

Maybe we were all just human
last year. Maybe we will all continue
to conform to being human this
year. But. it’s much harder. to at-
tempt to be oneself. When John
Lennon says "Christ; you know it
ain’t easy," he’s saying it all.

But then, maybe John Lennon’s a
freak. Maybe The Pitt News is a
waste of time. Maybe we’re all on an
ego trip. Maybe, because as man, were
the only animal that knows he must one
day die, were afraid to be ourselves
while were alive. «

Tillich says in his book “Education
showed that emphasis on the free de-
velopment of the individual child
does not reduce the changes of his
Becoming an active member of a con-
formist society.” True, and there is no
shame in conforming if that is being
oneself. ’The shame is not in con-
forming, or in not conforming, it is in

not thinking about things and ex-,

pressing the courage to

be
what one is — an individuals. ‘

And, as has been said before,
long hair and bell bottom pants do not
determine an individual. Nor does a
4.00 QPA. Nor does writing an edi-
torial for The Pitt News.

 

Up To You

 ‘J J- I Staff Columnist

Ah! It’s back to school again!

Some things look like they’ll be pretty goodthis year. There’s
, u going to be a wet rush; rumor has it that Vanilla Fudge will be here
I for‘ Homecoming; and there’s even hope for the football team to

‘ makeadecent showing. ’ '

  ~But, strange as it may seem, there’s a lot more to your life here.
  Or there should be.

, Open your eyes, my friend, and try to see beyond things like
the lack of cute freshman women. Look, for example, at the kids in
the Towers Lobby.

One or two of the kids down there are DJ ’s on WPGH. They set up
their broadcasting facilities» where they could be seen in an effort to.
raise money for the American Cancer Society.

 You know, cancer wipes out thousands of Americans every year.

  t But could ‘it be that there is asizable majority of University stu-

 A dents who won’t even stop and look, let along give them a quarter
I or ‘so? I’ll bet.

, A pretty criticism, you say? Well, that may be. But there are
A‘ J , even more important things happening on campus.

Like, for example, we got a new dean in CAS this summer. He
 and a few other new administrators are genuinely interested in lis-
 7‘ tening to students’ criticisms and complaints; and they’re willing to
 L ymake changes.

Since it’s your education (and, -ultimately your future) at stake,

  you should feel an obligation to make some comment on how you
~ think your courses are being handled, even if it’s just a small gripe.

Read it, my friend. There are new opportunities by the dozen
around here. And believe it or not, it’s all up to you. b

The day was just beginning to
warm up. The rain had stopped
and the chill in the air had dis-
appeared. The clarity of the sun

wrinkled bagginess of our clothes
and our eyes ringed from lack of

sleep and endless hoursof wait— *

Our sign was marked with wa-
ter stains. -

‘ Ian was sitting on the-grass. We
had made it to our third turn-
pike exit out of Philadelphia
and it was my turn to hitch.

The beige Volkswagen pulled
up and two young guys leaned
out of the window.‘ “Where are
you heading?”, the redhead ask-
ed.

Ian got up and we walked over
to the car, leaving a pile of as-

Hitching

O brother, I thought, as soon
as they see Ian’s hair and his
paint-blotched bells, they’re go'-
ing to find an excuse to leave.
“We’re going to New York,” Ian

told them in his English ac-

The Line Up ,

by MARC SIMON
‘ Staff Columnist

And so I found myself standing in the invoice
line for the eleventh time in my college career. I
really used to hate standing in line because it
seemed so tiresome —- you know, inching along,
sweating, going over the cards again and again to
make sure you didn’t forget your social security
number, how many cavities -your great-grand-
mother has had in the last two years, and other
such pertinent crap. But now ‘I sort of like stand-
ing in line. I like it not because it’s any dif-
ferent now (it isn’t), but because I’ve come to ap-
preciate the beautiful predictability of it. The pre-
cise tedium, the shicking regularity of standing in
line has the same type of appearl to me as does
Mayor Daley; that is, you think you know what’s
going to happen, and it always does, bad orrgood.

Everyone should know the script by now. You-
’ll be standing in line, see an acquaintance, and
start the stock conversation of “What’s happening?”
“Where. are you living this year?” “How was your
summer?” “How did you do last term?” All you
really have to do in reply is shake you head and
mumble something, because most people aren’t
really interested in your answers, anyway.
_‘.__._While_ I don’t see anything “wrong? with ex-

"» changing ' the 'us‘ua1‘ ‘g‘re‘éfi"rig's'?‘and ‘saluationsv, you i

must admit that it becomes rather tedious when
you repeatedly say the same things.iTherefore, if
you haven’t come to appreciate the boredom of
the whole scene as I have, why don’t you try to
make these stock conversations more interesting?
For example when someone says, “How are you?”
answer, “Oh, just fine now that they’ve removed
my left lung — well, they had to after they
discovered it was diseased while they were trans-
planting my new heart.” Or, to the question,
“Where are you living‘?”, reply, “Oh, I thought I’d
free-load off of you for a couple of months until
I find a place for next term.”

Then when you finally reach the counter you
can pull out a water gun and tell the girl,‘ “Ok-
ay, this is a stickup. Give me forty credit hours
worth of class cards in small demoninations and
all of your cancelled-invoices.” Or, you could start
spreading a rumor like, “Say, I heard the language
requirement had been completely dropped, but any-
one who is registered for a language and has al-
ready paid his invoice must take the course.” See
how fast the place would clear out.

I guess what I’m getting at is that you must
find some to relive the agony of standing in line,
whether it be through appreciating the boredom
or rebelling against it. After all, we’re more than
elephants who stand in a row~‘and holdweach

 Responding to the Student Publication Board resolution that

Vice Chancellor Edison Montgomery convene a committee to act
on the Pitt News financial crisis, Mr. Montgomery informed Pitt
News that the students henceforth will be empowered to set the
Student Activities Fee in advance of each trimester. The fall tri-

iméster fee of $6 for each full—time undergraduate student was

set by the administration after ‘discussion with representative
students. I

The,Office of Student Affairs has been given the task of set-
ting up the mechanism for determining the will of the students as

tmthe size of the fee. One possibility would be to assign this re-

sponsibility to Student Government.

Mr. Montgomery said he understood that some student or-
ganizations might be hard pressed during the fall trimester. He
stated that if the Pitt News wished a larger appropriation, it
should make its needs known to whatever group is established
to set the fee. If the fee is increased sufficiently, additional funds
could be allocated not only to the Pitt News, but also to all other
student publications or student organizations now being financed
by Student Government allocations, whose budget requests were

not met by current appropriations.

Mr. Montgomery admitted it will be “tough sledding”
for some student organizations for the fall trimester. He
strongly urges the Pitt News to petition the Student Gov-
ernment to raise the Student Activity Fee with the under-
standing that additional sums raised through this assess-
ment will be allocated not only to The Pitt News, but all
other student publications or student organizations now be-
ing financed by Student Government allocations, whose

‘ budget requests were not met by current appropriations.

William Neff, coordinator of Student Activities in the‘
Office of Student Affairs‘, says the resolution can be intro-
duced:. (a) by having a student senator introduce a resolu-
tion to raise the student activity fee, (b) approaching Scott
Baum, president of Student Government, and asking him
to put it on the agenda.

. In my conversation with Vic Willem who sits on the
StudentGovernment Committee on Allocations, I was in-
formed that that committee “will definitely recommend an
increase in the Student Activity Fee for the winter trimes-
ter.” If I understood Willem correctly (and I may have er-
red—-because ‘this was a conversation on-the-run) the A110-
cation Committee will total up all budget requests, then set

the Activities Fee to equal the grand total requested’ (Nat-

urally, the Allocations Committee will have screened all
budgets submitted.)

’ ' 7 The Allocations Committee is also investigating meth-
ods of» tapping graduate students for activities fee revenue

. Willem said. (The Pitt News had suggested that graduate

students, faculty, and administration also be assessed a
fee, in lieu of subscription fee, for their free copies of The
Pitt News. A letter requesting such an assessment, and ad-
dressed to all department chairmen brought an overwhelm-
ing negative response.)

If the graduate students, faculty, and administration
staff continue to receive f-ree copies of The Pitt News, it
would appear only fair that this sizeable help underwrite
the operating costs of the Pitt News which serves as a ma-
jor communications medium for the University commun-
ity.

The University administration, of course, has the
choice of seeing the Pitt News cease publication, and be-
stow the title of “official campus newspaper” to The Uni-
versity Times.-The latter is a University-financed publica-
tion—no funds are raised through subscriptions or adver-
tising—whose staff members, unlike those of the Pitt News,
are salaried employees.

BURTON M. HIRSCH
Business Manager

The Pitt News will begin publi-
cation this year in spite of severe
constraints placed on it by the un-
willingness of the University to
share in the funding of the paper,
and the inability of the Student
Government Allocations Commit-
tee to meet the fiscal requests of
the paper.

Like most major college news-
papers across the country, The
Pitt News must seek a portion of
its revenue from sources other
than advertising and off-campus

subscriptions since the paper is dis-

tributed free of charge.

The usual sources are a sum of
money given by the Student
Government, with funds coming
from a student activity fee, or a
University allocation.

In the past, at Pitt, the Uni-
versity gave the Student Govern-
ment a fixed allocation of $5 per
each full-time student — the
monies coming from “a mixture
of‘ sources” including the stu-
dent’s activity fee and the Student
Government distributed the
money to some 45 student or-
ganizations, including the Pitt
News.

This year, the Pitt News was

i   1, - imonday. September ii, l9§9i—THENVEWS-.-.-Page:j5«-  3‘

ewsraces

given less than half of its request.
The Student Government Alloca-
tions Committee suggested the
rest of the money “an additional
$11,500 be funded by the Uni-
versity for faculty and staff use of
the paper —- either from the to-
tal University budget or from
departmental or individual sub-
scriptions.”

I wrote to all department
heads requesting a lump sub-
scription fee and the results were
negative. -

In response to a resolution pas-
sed by_ the Student Publications
Board that “faculty and staff pay
their fair share of Pm News sub-
scription costs and that the Vice
Chancellor of Finance ( Mr.
Montgomery) and the Senate Coun-
cil work out an equitable solu-
tion.” Mr. Montgomery sug-
gested that the Pitt News ap-
proach the Student’ Government
and ask them to increase the
present $6 Student Activities
Fee. -

With the University refusing
to fund the paper and the Stu-
dent Allocations Committee un-
able to procure additional funds
for the Pitt News unless the Ac-
tivity Fee is raised, the~Pitt News
has three choices :-

1.To continue publication

 

until funds‘‘ru‘nout.’’ , V
2. Cut down the number: of

drop off distribution points.
At present we have a press ’

run of 11,000 and 20 drop-
off points on campus. We
will cut our press run to 6,
000 and

drop-off -points, servicing only
those areas

for the paper will have eas-
iest access to their news-
paper.

The University has this addi-

tional choice it would appear to ;

me. It can pay a subscriptionfee
for an approximately 5,500 faculty,
staff and employees who now

read the Pitt News free of charge. 

A precedence is already setrfor

such an action. The University un- ' ‘ V 
derwrites the complete cost of its   ‘
own publication The University ,
Times, which is distributed free I-
to the entire campus communi-* . »
ty. ., . A

It would appear that the Pit N‘

News, which presents the stu-
dent’s point of view, and which

raises 3/4 of its operating ex-0

penses receive a flat subscription

fee from the University for the

servicing given the campus corn-
munity.

In Shirley Jackson’s eerie short
story, “The Lottery,” a village
holds a drawing each year to de-
cide whom they will stone to

’death. In our colleges and univer-

sities, we do it twice a year. I

One character is Miss Jack-
son’s story raises a question about
why the villagers continue to
perform this inhuman ritual, but
an elder quiets him with, “We

. have always had a lottery.”

So it is with grades, and mid-
terms, and true and false ques-
tions, and multiple choices, and

4), and bell-shaped curves, and
Dean’s lists, and no-doz, and blue
books, and crib sheets, and proc-
tors and the rest. We have al-
ways had them —— or something
akin to them.

We have indeed always had them,
although there is literally not a
shred of research evidence which
supports the present grading
system. They are about as accur-
ate as the gas mileage statements
out of Detroit and about as ob-
jective as an old maid telling you
her age. That we have tolerated
grades for so long makes me ser-
iously question whether we have

Grades must go. Their only gen-
uine function is to serve cer-
tain administrative conveniences.
They do allow the registrar and
members of the deanery to de-
cide who is on probation, and who
can take an honors course, and who
sits on the dais at Phi Bet ban-
quets, etc., but they are too des-
tructive to be allowed to continue
to debase what a university could

Grades separate students and
professors into two warring camps
both armed with dangerous
weapons, none of which have any-
thing to do with a notion of a
community of scholars. The grades
keep student from teacher and
teacher from student as effec-
tively as if each worse the sweaty
jerseys of two arch-rivals fight-
ing for a bid to a bowl game.

A student cannot praise a pro-
fessor’s teaching within earshot
of other students, or he would be
slashed to ribbons for “brown-
nosing.” However, in the com-
fortable privacy of a profess0r’s
office, the slippery students keep
their appointments, and get in
the brownie point which, they have
well learned, are one of the prac-

tical ways to up their grade
point averages. Sadly, this same
information keeps many students
with integrity away from the pro-
fessor’s office.

If praise can’t be given, open
criticism of a professor to his
face is even rarer. It simply would
not be politic. Even if you had
some hint about how to make
his course better, the implied
disapproval would surely earn
retalliation. So it’ passes that
students and faculty — the two
groups on a campus which most
need to find each other —- are
separated by a wall as im-
penetrable as barbed wire, and it
is called a transcript. Grades over-
reward the wrong people and of-
ten punish students who need to
be punished the least. There is
something‘ basically immoral about
a system which passes out its
highest institutional appreciation to
ameritocracy based on memori-
zation, clever use of mnemonic
devices, test-wisdom, and various
symptons of anal compulsiveness.

The Dean’s list is made up of
just too many such people — grade
grubbers who seem to lack a
certainspark of creativity, sensiti-
vity, and humanity. The finely-

sifted ones who make the hon-
orary societies are often not
necessarily dishonorable, but their

unmitigated self-advancement tends

to make you wonder why the uni-
versity makes so much fuss over
such people at graduation. The
world is dying from selfishness
and yet the academic world gives
asterisks for it on commence-
ment programs.

At the other end of the con-
tinuum, grades have been used
systematically to screen out black
students, to decide who to ship out
to Vietnam, and to firmly re-
mind those who will not conform
that they are failures. It be-
comes increasingly clear that
those who" knuckle under to the
grading system and learn what
reality is all about (“Look, the
guy likes Buber, so I give him
Buberisms all semester,”) are the
ones who reap the ‘rewards.
Those who question the system or
resist it often get flunked out,
neatly and sometimes finally.

Grades tend to destroy what
learning should be all about. Stu-
dents sign up for
crap courses they neither need
nor want, but which give a sure
“B” without requiring many pa-
pers, or much reading, etc. Stu-
dents avoid courses which they
might be curious about but can-
not afford a low grade in because

it would mess up their “cum.”

Craftier students soon learn to
balance their 15-18 semester hours
with a mixture of hard markers
and easy markers, and like
good consumers, they budget their
time each night and study a lit-
tle of this and a*little of that.
Passionately wanting to go and
learn something in real depth is
somehow looked upon -as slightly
uncouth. After all, those “meaty”
courses with a mid-term, a term
paper or two, a final and three
snap quizzes scattered here
and there (so we can divide by
5 and get a good, objective aver-
"age in order to give you a good,
objective grade) have to be spread
out carefully if one is to “keep
up.”

plays which are not assigned, and
no one except a fool spends more
time in the library than he needs
to padout, with the right num-
ber of footnotes, a paper which
the student guesses the professor
will like (whether the student
cares deeply about it doesn’t
matter). Grades make it almost
thinkable to consider writing a
paper which might later be sent
as an article to a magazine like
Moderator.

Pragmatism, then requires stu-
dents to .begin approaching the
selection of courses like the di-
rectors of a conservative mu-
tualfund picking out a portfolio
of safe investments——everything in
moderation. It is little wonder that
so many graduates later join the
Book-of-the-Month Club to -he
told‘ what to read and all the
Theater Guild to pick their drama
for them. Grades reinforce an ar-
“completion”
which may well turn out to be
deadly in the l9’70’s. Sure, life is
competitive", at least if you
are in’ the business of selling
storm windows or aluminum sid-
ing. Yes, Ford, Chevy, and Ply-
mouth would like to slice each
other’s throats for a bigger chunk
of the market, and all three of
them would like to rub Volkswagen
off the map. Nevertheless, the
skills of competition.

veins. Most of our efforts to make
our neighborhoods and com-
munities healthier and happier de-

pend on some complex forms of co-

operation. And almost everything
the college graduate does today
to make a living demands cooper-
ation. Almost everything gets done
through committees, and the
really valuable co-worker knows
the intricate skills of group
process, and has the humanity
necessary to control his ego and
his competition; the beast in us is
instinctively competitive. But we

own slightly sullied advancement
into the above $20,000 brackets. Al-
truism and a sense of commun-

leges and universities. , Too

books, making one of thoseclasses
where the prof proudly tells you he
will give as many F’s as A’s, just

won’t find many people who will

Four years and more of this
kind of competitive treadmill
might prepare a college graduate
for ruthless dashes down the ex-
pressway at rush hour, but I surely
would not want to be the first
Negro to move into his block. Of
all the destructive things grades
do, probably the ugliest is that they
contribute " to debasing a stu-
den~t’s estimation of his own
worth. The emphasis and extremes
focus upon grades, term after
term, seems to squeeze a student’s

identity and self-image within the;

narrow confines of his transcript.

Students" everywhere are in a
quandary. They have too little else
upon which to test themselves.
They are saddled with an extended
adolescence. They have no real
opportunities to be either independ-
ent or courageous or to test un-
der duress their love of their fel-
low man. As a consequence, stu-
dents often stake their identity,
almost from misguided interpreta--
tions of their significance.

How could we have allowed
those numbers to spew wides-
pread feelings of inadequacy, in-
feriority, and lack of power
among perfectly useful and de-
cent people? Have you heard of
students who have given up car-
eers because they tought they just-
don’t “have it” when they receiv-
ed a low grade in a basic course
in their major? The worshipping at
the shrine of numbers is a king
of madness which we accept
almost without. reflection, and
which has about as much validity
as treating a cancer with a
spray deodorant.

The pursuit of grades has dri-.
ed up the average student’s sense
that he can shape and change the
world around him. With his eye on
the carrot at the end of the
semester, he does not really be-
lieve that he can make a course
better. He doesn’t really believe
that students can and should have
some stake in evaluating their ed-
ucation. It is almost heresy for
him to believe that he has some

valid insights into_ the hiring and
firing of professors. Not wanting to
antagonize the grade givers, he
does not complain about large
classes, irrelevant lectures, inap-
propriate assignments, unneces-
sary prerequisites, or even an un-
readable textbook.

How many of our students sim-
ply do not know who they are be-
cause for so many years they
have been jumping hurdles put
up by other people? Finally, on
their own, they do not seem to
have the resources for making
meaningful choices of build-
ing values to live by. Otherwise,
would so many of them end up
like the characters in John
Cheever’s Shady Hill suburb?
Those urban, handsome, ivy-league
types going off to high-paying jobs
that they hate, (made tolerable by
martinis at lunch), marrying at-
tractive-but—shallow girls, raising
children who greet them with,
“What did you buy me?” and tol-
erating terrible abuse from their
bosses so as not to get fired and
thereby? jeopardize the country
club membership the $40,000 de-
development house, the vinyl hard-
top, and their credit with the

iothodontist: Is that what a col-
lege education is supposed to pro-
duce?

Over and over I hear the
phrase, “Well, that’s reality.” I
think we are long overdue in ex-
amining a greater reality behind
the grading system. It may be
called “reality” to say, “All col-
leges have grades,,” but all col-
leges do not have them. It may be
reality to_ say, “Grades are the
only thing that graduate schools
are concerned about,” but the
best of _the grad schools are not all
that concerned about them. When
people say, “Well, that’s the sys-
tem,” I want to shout, “Systems
have been changed.”

I believe we ignore at great
peril the greater reality of a
learning environment in which
students and professors become
increasingly alienated from each
other, where cheating and
the con-man are daily operative,
and where what a student gets
out of a course can be boiled
down to a single, crude letter of
the alphabet.

I am convinced that a real on-
slaught upon the grading system
could have dramatic and imme-
diate positive impact upon our uni-
versities. If nothing else, many
of the most flagrant academic

   
  
  
   
   
  

abuses might be flushed out into
the open.

Professors who can’t teach will
be forced to face that truth if
we take awaythe protection of
their dangling A’s and F’s. Profes-
sors who can teach but who get
more of the institutional rewards
from doing research or playing
to teaching. Busy—work assign-
ments will be challenged and ‘so
will those fraudulent reading as-
signments (2,000'pages a week-
end?). V

Students will shape and change
many assignments they now mer-
ely accept. Assignments will be
more individualized and the cur-

riculum will take on a new rele- '

vancy. It is no wonder that
the old guard, including those Un-
cle Tom students who say, “Why
I don’t see what’s wrong with the
grading system. Mister Charlie,
he treats me real good, especially
at transcript time.” will resist
doing away with the present grad-

ing system.

Change is coming, however. The

‘danger is that we may merely be

satisifed with a little tinkering
hera and a bit of adjusting there.
A limited pass-fair system will
not be sufficient to remove
thatinane cry from our colleges,
“Wadjaget?”

What we really need is a sweep-
ing awareness among students that

they are being short-changed at

that supermarket they call alma
mater. They need to realize that
they are the customers and , as
such, they have every right to de-
mand that they get a real educa-
tion. They must learn to see
through our ruses. They must not

‘allow themselves to be bought off

with green stamps which they
glue into their transcripts and
turn in at the redemption center
at graduation time for creden-
tials. Grades must go.

Ho Named 
New Dean  

Dr. Monto Ho, professor on the
faculty of the University of Pitts-’
burgh Graduate School of Public , ,
Health (GSPH), has been appoint-_
ed chairman of the school’s De- _
partment of Epidemiology and I 
Microbiology. Announcement of
theappointment was madeby Dr.
Herschel Griffin, dean of the  .
GSPH. Dr. Ho will succeed Dr. a
William McD. Hammon who was .
recently retired as chairman of . 
the department but will continue '
to serve on the faculty.

Dr. Ho, a magna cum laude and
Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Har-
vard University and Harvard ‘ 
Medi al School is certified by the ‘
American Board of Internal Medi-
cine and is a diplomate ‘of the ,
American Board of Microbiology. ' 
He has studied under Nobel laure-
ate Dr. John Enders and was a
1966 recipient. of a Fulbright _
Senior Fellowship for study at the 
Max Planck Institute of Virology,
Germany. Dr. H0 is a well-known! 
authority onthe role of interferon '~ 
(an antiviral substance) in the gr
development of immunity. ' ”

He completed an internship and
residency at Boston City Hospital '
and held post graduate study and a
research fellowships in medicine,
bacteriology and immunology at. 
Harvard Medical School, Boston’ 
City Hospital and Children’s Med- 
ical Center, Boston. _ I P 

Dr. Ho has served on Pitt’s fac-
ulty since 1959 and, beginning, in .
1965, has held a joint appointment .
as professor in GSPH and associ-I
ate professor of medicine in Pitt’s J-
School of Medicine. ’ ‘

 

 
 

Of Dr. Ho’s appointment, Dean-I
Griffin said: “We are delighted ‘
that a man of Dr. Ho’s background "
and training has agreed to assume
the responsibilities of directing-
and carrying forward the out- A? 
standing record and goals of the . I D
department.” a

Major James P. Byrnes, acting '
professor of Military Sciences, Y
stated that the enrollment was 
“considerably lower” in this‘ 
year’s freshman class. Statistics
given by Major Byrnes verify this L, by
statement. Last year’s freshman‘ by I
class of officers had 174 en'- 1
rolled. The number of freshman of- r f
ficer trainees registered for fall} ﬂj__‘
term is a meager~34. ' A

Enrollment in the sophomore. 
and advanced levels of the officer) A 
corps remained about the same as 7' I f
it has been in the past, these two? 
levels still retaining their accred— N
itation.

Asked what he thought about the
future of ROTC, Maj. Byrnes opin- V r
ionated that if the freshman en-
rollment continued to be, as low
as this year, it could become too
expensive for the Army to conin- V
ue the program. At the present 
time the ROTC is still operating 
with the staff at full strength. ' I

Although ROTC has been dis-
credited by the CAS, the School of
Engineering, School of Pharmacy
and School of Education still main-"
tain accreditation, according to
Maj. Byrnes.

The people of Berkeley must

2. We will create our revolu-
tionary culture everywhere.

Everyone should be able to
express and develop himself
through art — work, dance, sculp-
ture, gardening and all means
open to the imagination. Mater-
ials will be made available to all
people. We will defy all puritan-
ical restraints on culture and sex.
We shall. have media——newspap-
ers, posters and leaflets, radio,
Tv, films and skywriting—-to ex-
press our revolutionary com-
munity. We will stop the fefiling
of the earth; our relation to na-
ture will be guided by reason and
beauty rather than profit. The vil-
ilization of concrete and plastic
will be broken and natural things
respected. We shall set up urban
and rural communes where peo-
ple can meet for expression and
communication. Many Berkely
streets bear little traffic and
can be grassed over and turned
into people’s parks. Parking
meters will be abolished and we
will close areas of downtown and
South Campus to automotive traf-
fic. We shall celebrate the holi-
days 0 liberation with fierce
dancing. ’ V

3. We will turn the schools into
training grounds for liberation.

Beneath the progressive facade
of Berkeley’s schools, students
continue to be regimented into ac-
cepting the existing system.
The widely - celebrated integra-
tion of the schools is nothing in
itself, and only perpetuates many
illusions of white liberalism. The
basic issue is creating an edu-
cational system in which stu-
dents have real power and which
prepares the young to partici-
pate in a revolutionary world. Stu-
dents must destroy the senile dic-
tatorship of adult teachers and
bureaucrats. Grading, tests,
tracking, demotions, detentions
and explusions must be abolished.
Pigs and narcs have no place in a
peop1e.s school. We will elimin-
ate the brainwashing, fingernail-
cutting mass production of junior
cogs for tight-ass America’s old
age home war machine. Students
will establish independent educa-
tional forms to create revolution-
ary consciousness while contin-
uing to struggle for change in the
schools.

sity unless it serves the people.

is not only the major oppressive

institution in Berkeley, but a major
brain center for world domina-

tion. UC attempts to kill radical

politics and culture in Berkeley

while it trains robots for cor-

porations and mental soldiers

to crush opposition from Delano

to Vietnam.

Students should not recognize
the false authority of the re-
gents, administration and faculty.
All students have the right to
learn what they want, from whom
they want, and in themanner
they decide; and the right to take
political action without academ-
ic penalty. We will build a move-
ment to make the University rele-
vant to the Third World work-
ers, women and young people
searching for human values
and vocations. Our battles will be
conducted in the classrooms and
the streets.

We will shatter the myth that

UC is a sacred intellectual insti-
tution with a special right to ex-
ist. We will change this deadly
Machine which steals our land
and rapes our minds, or we will
stop its functioning. Education can
only begin when we’re willing to
close the University for what we
believe.
5. We will struggle for the full
liberation of women as a neces-
sary part of the revolutionary
process.

While the material oppres-
sion of women varies in differ-
ent classes, male supremacy per-
vades all social classes. We will
resist this ideology and practice
which oppresses all women. As we
struggle to liberate ourselves,

many of the problems of in- B

equality, authoritarianism and
male chauvinism in the.Berkeley
movement will be overcome.

We will create an unfettered
identity for women. We will
abolish the stifling masculine and
feminine roles that this society
forces on us all. Women will no

drug busts will be defined as
political and we will develop all
necessary defense for those ar-

8. We will break the power of the
landlords and provide beautiful
housing for everyone.

Through rent strikes, direct
seizures of property and other
resistance campaigns. the large
landlords. banks and developers
who are gouging higher rents and
spreading ugliness will be driv-
en out. We shall force -them to
transfer housing control to the
community, making decent hous-
ing available according to peo-
ple’s needs. Coordinated hous-
ing councils will be formed on a
neighborhood basis to take re-
sponsibility for rents and build-
ing conditions. The Housing coun-
cils will work with architects to
plan for a beautiful community.
Space will be opened up and
living communes and revolutionary
families will be encouraged.

9. We will tax the Corporations,
not the working people.

The people cannot tolerate es-
calating taxes which are wasted in
policing the world while business-
men are permitted to expand
their profits in the midst of des-
perate social need. Berkeley can-
not be changed without confront-
ing the industries, banks, in-
surance companies, railroads and
shipping interests dominating the

Bay Area. In particular, Univer-
sity of California expansion
which drives up taxes should be
stopped and small homeowners
should no longer pay property
taxes. We will demand a direct
contribution from business. in-
cluding Berkeley‘s biggest bus-
iness —— the University. to the
community until a nationwide
assault on big business is succes-
sful.

10. We will defend ourselves
against law and order.

America’s rulers, faced with
the erosion of their authority in
Berkeley. begin to take on the
grotesque qualities of a dicta-
torship based on pure police pow-
er. We shall abolish the tyrannical
police forces not chosen by
the people. States of emergency,
martial law, conspiracy changes
and all legalistic measures used
to crush out movement will be
resisted by any means neces-
sary -— from courtroom to armed
struggle. The people of Berkeley
must arm themselves and learn the
basic skills and tactics of self de-
fense and street fighting. All op-
pressed people in jail are politi-
cal prisoners and must be set free.

We shall make Berkeley a san-
ctuary for rebels, outcasts and
revolutionary fugitives. We shall
attempt to bring the real criminals
to trial; where this is impossible
we shall implement revolutionary
justice.

11. We will create a soulful so-
cialism in Berkeley.

The revolution is about our
lives. We will fight against the
dominating Berkeley life style
of affluence, selfishness, and social

apathy — and also against the
self-indulgent individualslm which
masquerades as "doing your own
thing." We will find ways of
taking care of each other as com-
rades. We will experiment with
new ways of living together
such as communal families in
which problems of income. child‘
care. and housekeeping are mu-
tually shared. Within the Berkeley
movement we will seek alter-
natives to the stifling elitism, ego-
ism, and sectarianism which
rightly turns people away and
creates organizational weakness.
We have had enough of supposed
vanguards seeking to manipulate
mass movements. We need van-
guards of a new type — people
who lead by virtue of their mor-
al and political example; who
seek to release and organize
energy instead of
mg or curbing it; who seek pow-
er not for themselves but for the
people as a whole. We firmly
believe in organization which I
brings out the leadership and»
creativeness existing in everyone.

12. We will create a peoples
Government.

We will not recognize the au-
thority of the bureaucratic and un-
representative local government.
We will ignore elections

involving trivial issues and per- 
sonalities. We propose a referen- ‘

dum to dissolve the present gov-

channeh 0

ernment. replacing it with
one based on the tradition of di-
rect participation of the people.
People in motion around their own
needs will become a decentral-
ized goverment of neighborhood
councils, workers councils. student
unions, and different sub-cultures.
Self-management in schools, fac-
tories, and neighborhoods will
become commonplace. Locally
chosen “people’s mediators” will
aid those desiring to settle dis-
putes without referring to the
illegitimate system of power.

13. We will unite with other
movements throughout the world

to destroy this motherfucking
racistcapitalistimperialist sys-
tem.

Berkeley cannot be free until
America is free. We will make
the American revolution with
the mass participation of all the
oppressed and exploited people. We
will actively support the 10-
point program of the Black Pan-
they Party in the black colony; all
revolutionary organizing attempts
among workers, women, students
and youth; all Third World
liberation movements. We will
create an international Liberation
School in Berkeley as a training
center for revolutionaries.

for which they have met the sta-
ted departmental prerequisite.

The first course in a second or
third language will count toward
Distribution of Studies. Language
level two must be taken in order
for the credits for level one to
count toward graduation. Only
the first course in the second or
third language will count toward
satisfying the Distribution of Stu-
dies requirement.

The Pass/Fail option for jun-
iors and seniors has been changed
to a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory
option for all students.

S represents A.B. C. grades and
counts as credit toward gradua-
tion. but will not be used in com-
puting the QPA. U represents D
and F‘ grades and carries neither‘
credit nor quality points.

Students may elect one S/U

44444-V-V~¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥~¥¥¥¥¥¥

. 682-3738

course of their own choosing
each term (a maximum of eight)
in any area, including that of the
major unless specifically prohibi-
ted by the major department.

A S/U course will be indica-
ted on a special card included
with invoices. The card should
be given to the instructor of the
course selected by the time
final examinations begin.

Students engaged in meeting the
language requirement have the
option in language one. two.
three. four. ten. and eleven either
to take courses for quality
grades <A.B.C.D. or F) or to elect
the S/U grading system.

A required language may be
taken S/U in addition to the eight
optional courses.

If the student wishes to exer-
cise the S/U option for both the
required language and another
course in the same term. he
should apply at the College Of-
fice for a second S/U card.

Several ways of satisfying the
language level four have been
approved. One alternative has the
same foreign literature content
as the current language four
course.

‘Another alternative, also listed
as language four, stresses culture
and is presented primarily through
the foreign language.

A third alternative has courses
designated by each of the for-
eign language departments as ac-
ceptable alternatives to language
level four. which may be checked
with individual advisors.

If the student has already tak-
en one of the courses designa-
ted as an alternative by his
language department. the re-
quirement is considered met.

Ideally, the student should
take the alternative during the
term in which be normally would
have taken language level four.
However, since not all courses
are taught every term, and since
several of the alternatives have
prerequisities, the requirement
will be that the student must com-
plete one of the alternatives some
time prior to graduation from the
College.

A course taken as an alternative
to language level four also satis-
fies part of the Distribution of
Studies requirement.

The language level four alterna-
tive may be taken on the S/U
basis in addition to the eight op-
tional courses.

Instead of 124 credits neces-
sary for graduation, CAS students
will be graduated with 120 pas-
sing credits, provided all re-
quirements are met.

CAS students beginning this
term will not be required to
take physical education nor to

‘complete the sequence if it has

been started. If any student wish-
es. he may take up to four one
credit physical education courses
to apply toward his degree of
120 credits.

Physical education elective cre-
dits may be taken only on the
S/U basis. It will be in addition
to the other optional S/U courses.

These credits in physical edu-

~ Curriculum Requirements Revised

cation will not be counted as
part of the 12 credit non- CAS
course maximum available to each
student.

Official double majors may be
earned by CAS students if re-
quirements are fulfilled in both
departments. Graduation certifi-
cation will be done by both de-
partmental advisors and both ma-
jors will appear on the final gradu-
ation transcript. However. the
diploma will show only one de-
gree. Bachelor of Arts or Bach-
elor of Sciences.

Undergraduate students may
take graduate courses during any
of their undergraduate terms and
have credits counted toward the
CAS baccalaureate degree. No
minimum QPA will be required,
but the student must have writ-
ten approval of his advisor and the
instructor of the course.

There is no limit to the num-
ber of graduate courses a student
may take in a term, and the cour-
ses may be taken on an S/U basis.

With departmental approval a
graduate course could be sub-
stituted for a course in the ma-
jor.

Arrangements have been made‘
for a Post-Baccalaureate year.
A University graduate may re-
turn to the College for not more
than two terms to register with
his former major advisor to take
additional courses of his choos-
ing.

The student must present a ra-
tionale to the Dean of the Col-
lege before he is accepted for a
post-baccalaureate term or year.
These credits will not be counted
toward a second degree in the
College.

The same opportunity is avail-

’ able to graduates of other univer-

sities.

Is Body So Ethereal

 Touch Is Defamation?

by DON MARBURY
News Editor

You’re sitting on a crowded bus and notice the middle-aged wo-
man sitting across from you. For a split second your eyes meet un-
expectedly, and you both turn them away, totally disturbed and em-
barrassed.

Your eyes involuntarily fall upon a young woman’s glittering
medallion hanging around her neck, but they are again forced away
as you notice the angry stare of the young woman your eyes have
seemingly violated.

You’re walking through a crowded street and ‘your hand acci-
dentally brushed against some man’s arm. He looks at you coldly,
awaiting the expected, and you guilty appease him with the words
“excuse me.”

[recently read a science fiction novel, which tried to outline
what the world would be like hundreds of years from now. Its
main concern was the personalities and mores that people would
have during this time.

The people in this age were forbidden to touching or even look-
ing directly at or speaking to each other.

On my first reading I found myself smiling knowlingly to my-
self and thinking “man, even for a science fiction novel this one is
way out There isn’t any way in the world this could happen.”

But then I started to wonder. I began to think about all the times
some fine young woman had caught me admiring her with my eyes,

and I had quickly turned them away. I remember getting cursed at '

for looking at a person a second too long for the most innocent and
simple reasons.

How many times when a complete stranger says hello to you as
he passes, do you turn around to look at him as if he were some un-
believable nut"? When a stranger picks up a conversation with a girl,
he immediately considered to be out for some sex.

People aren’t supposed to speak to, or start a conversation with

people they don’t know, but how do you get to know someone unless

you speak to, or start a conversation with them. ?

How often do you brush against different people everyday, and
how often do you say: “I beg your pardon,” “I’m sorry,” or “please
excuse me,” no matter how slight the act of brushing was? Is the hu-
man body such a perfect, such an-ethereal thing that the act of
slightly touching it is a defamation?

You may say to yourself something like “with all the problems
in the world this fool’ is concerned with people not speaking to each
other, and being afraid to touch.”

But -isn’t this the essense of most of the problems in the world --
the fact that people cannot communicate with each other? These are
seemingly little extraneous things I have been talking about, but they
are the basis for all these big things that are plaguing mankind.

Maybe, just maybe, that science fiction author will be right in a
few hundred years; that is if there are any people left not to look
at each other, not to speak to each other, not to be allowed to touch
each other, and not to communicate with each other, by that time.

They’d Rather Switch Than Fight

FAS Seeks New Dean

by SANDY DeVIRGILIO
and VIRGINIA PADUON0
Staff Writers

Background notes: Beginning
with the resignation of Dr. David
Halliday, who left his position as
a Dean in the College of Arts
and Sciences (CAS) for health
reasons, five administrators have
resigned their University posts.

—— Dr. James A. Kehl, dean of
the CAS, and Dr. James Wat-
son, Assistant dean of the Col-
lege, returned to teaching.

—— David Ginevan, director of
housing, and William Markus,
assistant dean of Students, left the
University to enter the business
world.

— Dr. Jack B. Critchfield, as-
sistant Chancellor in Student Af-
airs, assumed posts with the North
Carolina Board of Higher Educa-
tion and Rollins College in Win-
ter Park, Florida.

-— Miss Lorraine Sibbet, asso-
ciate director of Housing, also re-
signed. .

These changes call attention
to new names and faces in the ad-
ministration, some new to the Uni-
versity, and some new only to the
posts they assume.

-— Dr. Jerome B. Schneewind as-
sumed the post of Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences.

—— Dr. Edward Barnes was ap-
pointed Associate Dean of the
College.

—— Dr. Schneewind appointed
Tobias Dunkelberger of the
Chemistry Department as Asso-
ciate Dean, and Ralph Proctor
as an Assistant to the Dean.

—— Bernard J. Kobosky, former
Director of Admissions, became
Dean of Student Affairs.

—- Fred Robie was appointed
Acting Director of Admissions.

— John Vrana, former Director

placed Ginevan as Director of
Housing.

— Daniel McFadden became
Director of Student Affairs Plan-
ning, the post vacated by Vrana.

— Chenits Pettigrew assumed
the position of Assistant Dean of
Students.

Change has over run the Univer-
sity administration in recent
months. Dr. J. Steele Gow is one
administrator who must be es-
pecially aware of this. Since
early March he has seen his pos-
ition as Assistant Provost of the
University’s Division of Instruc-
tional Experimentation put aside
while he was asked to fill such
positions as Dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences and Dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences Council. (FASC).

Since Dr. Gow is serving
only as acting dean of FASC, a
search committee has been or-
ganized to find a qualified ad-

ministrator to assume the post. -’

Half of the search committee is
elected from FASC, while the re-
maining half is appointed by the
Provost and Chancellor. Two stu-
dent representatives have also been
included. According to Max A.
Lauffer, chairman of the search
committee, the group has not yet
met but a meeting is tentatively
scheduled for next week.

Gow, commenting on the quali-
ties the search committee may
look for in a newdean, believes
dedication to be the prome pre-
requisite for the position. Gow
contends that this particular dean-
ship requires “a person with a
strong committment to faculty
quality.” He dubbed the position,
a “super deanship,” demanding
someone who “enjoys the trials
and tribulations of administra-
tion.”

Faculty Group Try
To Support Blacks

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

Faculty, staff and students at
the University have become in-
volved .in the recent attempts of
the Black Construction Coali-
tion to penetrate the union com-
plex in Pittsburgh.

The Campus Supporters of the
Black Coalition, an ad hoc group
numbering about 25 participated in
the demonstrations last week
and have been in communica-
tion with city groups to plan fu-
ture maneuvers.

A petition was launched last
week by Dr. Robert Marshall of
the English Department, addressed
to the Chancellor, recommending
that the University assume a
leadership role in the controver-
5y- .

Sporting more than 200 sig-
natures, the petition also pre-
sents an agend‘ for action.

It was addressed to the Chan-
cellor, and read :-

“You have undoubtedly, dur-

’ ing your absence, been kept in-

formed of the tension that has
existed irr the City of Pitts-

_ burgh for over a week. This

issue is the long-standing dis-
criminatory practice of the con-
struction unions. The cause of the
evil, and the cure, this time as
rarely before in such crises are
clear, precise and well docu-
mented.

  WPGH is broadcasting round

the clock all this week in the
towers lobby to raise funds for

  cancer research.

ARE WE DOING IT FOR OUR
  HEALTH???

The Campus Supporters stated in
the letter that they felt the Uni-
versity had a serious obligation to

provide an example of moral lead- -

ership to the community, and that
the percentage of the Univer-
sity participating in the City’s
construction ‘effort was of lit-
tle importance. “The impact of
a practical committment by
the University to the clear course
of justice on the City’s con-
struction leaders would be im-
measurable,” the letter stated.

The letter urged the Chan-
cellor to suspend all construc-
tion at the University over which

he has no control, and to re- .

quest the commonwealth to take
similiar action with its con-
struction at the University, “un-
til,” the letter read, “a just and

firm settlement to the dispute has

been achieved.”

The Campus Supporters’ agen-
da will be concerned with the
University’s own construction
works, bail and bond money, and
future demonstrations.

According to James Cunning-_ ‘
ham of the School of Social Work,

more than $6,000 was collected by

the University group in alignment.

with civic organizations, such as

the Catholic Interracial Coun- C

cil and the Peace and Freedom
Center to provide for bail and
bond expenses.

To facilitate communication, an
inter-University telephone net-

work has been set up. Dr. Henry ‘

Finck of the Medical School will
start the chain and handle all of
the Health Professions. ‘

Dr. Arthur Tuden, of the an-
thropology department, is taking
care of the Social and Natural
Sciences, while Dr. Marshall plans

to alert faculty members from»
the Humanities when they are need-

ed to express their support for a
planned demonstration.

Mr. Cunningham has hopes of
extending the crusade agains
the closed door practices of the
unions into all areas of Univer-
sity employment. He expects
the electricians and the steam fit-
ters unions to be especially un
cooperative. ‘

(Editor's Note: This is the first of a continuing series dealing with the
course on French Existen tialsim taught by the Rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein.
The personality of the professor and his approach to philosophy and to
life in general provide the theme for the series.)

by george lies
Contributing Editor

It was 12:45 p.m., Thursday. The traffic was jamming Forbes Ave-
nue, outside Common Facilities. A ‘siren whined, somewhere at a dis-
tance. It was muggy, and hot. Inside CF, the faces were the same faces;
young and smiling; sideburns were longer. dress much more fashion-
able.

It was 12:50 p.m. Many, literally hundreds, turned toward CF
120. Rabbi Richard Rubenstein course was ten minutes away from
another term. He teaches French 180, existentialism, a word too
many people feel is over their heads. And that's a shame.

THERE WAS a rumor that this would be hisdlast term at Pitt. That’s
why well over 500 students registered for it; most of them getting in
after the course was closed. It was a false rumor. The Rabbi returns
next fall, after a eight-month sabbatical leave. He’ll probably teach the
course again. And again, it will be just as different as the one before. It
all depends on the man.

It was 1 p.m. The seats in the back of the room were already filled,
but with so many in the class. the seats in the front were filling.

At five minutes after one, the Rabbi walked down the left aisle; as
usual, he was wearing dark sunglasses. He appeared calm, and you
might add, cool. In a moment, he would begin to end a decade. The
1960’s have only four months of life left.

REBELLION, DRUGS, racism, the moon, Neil Armstrong—the
60’s, weaned them, but as we, the 60’s must come to accept the ulti-
mate. Death.

Man’s technological blunder — a missing microphone —— loudspeak-
— held up the Rabbi’s opening address for about 15 minutes (why strain
a voice for 80 minutes, he thought).

Then he outlined the course. He doesn’t like grades, he said; French
180—for those who cared about grades——was always an A, B course.
A student evaluation survey over a yearago, discovered that stu-
dents felt the course was graded too easy. Dean James Kiehl (remem-
ber him from last year) called him and told the Rabbi: “I think you
should grade on a curve.”

THE COURSE is scheduled to study the major works of Jean Paul
Sartre and Albert Camus. Usually, the same books are covered. The
course is taught, however, as a reflection of Rubenstein, the man.

It will be taught for the personal life style of the student. The Rabbi
doesn’t know which student is ready for what. He doesn’t claim to lead
young people in any way.

From birth to adolescence to death, a person lives, influenced by
what’s happening. The Rabbi realizes you can’t do anything you please.

“There are always consequences,” he says. “You must be willing to ac- H’

cept the consequences.”

“It’s a question of finding limits which you can tolerate,” he said
in an interview following his class.

  

THE RABBI returned to Pittsburgh, after a stay in Franco, Spain.
He owns a home in the town of Deya, on the island of Majorca. Literary
and movie people also live there; some, Robert Graves for example
stay there year-round.

He didn’t want to return to Pittsburgh. But he said, he’s hung up on
Pittsburgh. “It’s a love-hate relationship,” he says. -

No one would return anywhere, after a look at what he said was a
more or less daily schedule: breakfast early in the morning. write and
read until lunch, rest and then to the beach for a swim or two. after-
wards, a cocktail or two (no one drinks scotch there, brandy’s only five
cents a shot, supper, and then “You’re too tired to do anything else but
go to sleep.

“One of the temptations of Spain is that I found I could live in
Spain. We’d listen to five minutes of news on the BBC at 10 o’clock'_ ev-
ery night in order to keep up with the outside world. We knew if China
declared war on the United States, the BBC would manage to sneak it
through between cricket.and lacrosse.”

IN SPAIN, Rubenstein found the life he probably wants. He did not
delay his appreciation of life. He enjoyed it then, at that time in Spain.
His return to Pittsburgh, according to what he feels he’ll be teaching in
the course. is putting off enjoyment for tomorrow; saving it in an “emo-
tional and financial bank account."

In life's turmoil, especially today, the Rabbi sees two different at-
titudes toward life. If you feel tomorrow is important, he says, you will
be a part of man‘s technology which will ultimately attempt to over-
come death, the natural end.

If you’re like Camus, he says, you will accept the fact you’re‘going
to die. There is no God. All there is is this life. and you're not going to
have another. ‘

His course will develop the ideas, he says for in these times, there
are problems.

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

The Black Paper for Black Studies de-
buted this summer along with a series
of changes and expansions in the area of
black studies at the University.

Co-written by Dr. Jack Daniels of the
Speech Department and Curtiss Porter of
the Black Action Society (BAS), the
Black Paper defined the need and struc-
ture for a comprehensive program of black
tudies.

The lengthy program set up a dia-
gram for a school of black studies here.
The proposed curriculum was explained by
Porter as “full knowledge of the place of
ﬁthe black man in the world.’’ - ‘

y.

   
    
 
   
  
 
  

In order to avoid the guidelines of
the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences as to
grades and appointments and because they
consider the black studies program to be a
unique venture, the composers of the
Paper suggest that a school of black stu-
dies be under the aegis of the Black Stu-
dies Council.

The structure of the school works as
follows:

—— Departmental divisions coordinated
by_a vice-chancellor of Afro-American Af-
fairs or a black Provost. The school would
be headedby the Dean of the School of
Black Studies.

— Community institutes, designated geo-
graphically, extending University work and
dealing with community issues such as food

MR

«> Qyproblems, sanitation, etc.
— Research institutes.

Under the present University struc-
ture, a self-designed major may be ar-
ranged in Black Studies. The project-
ed school idea would provide a degree in
Black Studies.

According to Porter, the all inclusive,
i.e. circular, curriculum of the proposed
school will affect black students in a five
step pattern.

“The first step,” he averred “is aware-
ness —— awareness of the situation of the
world today and the black man’s place in
it. This would lead to reconditioning the
minds of the black students.”

The stage following awareness is cath-
arsis, “vomiting out the unclean lies
about self, readjusting the sights and mov-
ing past romanticism.”

From awareness and catharsis evolves
black functioning. This involves taking
the education back into the community.

The fourth stage deals with work in
communal groupsings, thus the emphasis
in thd black studies program on the com-
munity.

The final evolution is liberation. “That
will not occur in the University,” impres-
ed Dr. Daniels, “but in the community
where black people are.”

It came out as at summer session meet-
ing of the Faculty of the Arts and Sci-
ences Council (FASC) that the Chan-
cellor, Wesley Posvar, and those sympa-
thetic to the tone of the Black Paper did
not see eye to eye. ‘

“Because the University must serve the
interests of the entire community and in-
deed the interests of the entire state and
nation, we cannot accept a concept that
might contribute toward greater separa-
tism in our society,” wrote Dr. Posvar in
reference to the Black Paper.

The Chancellor furthermore endor-
sed the idea of a department as opposed to
a school of black studies, adding that any
department “must conform and be con-
sistent with established University poli-
cies and procedures.”

At the present time-, it appears that a
Department of Black Studies is in the
making. The FASC, representing the en-
tire faculty, supported the concepts em-
bodied in the Black Paper, welcomed “the
prospect of a Black Studies Department”
and urged a greater budgetary allowance
for it.

Biacit Situdents Broadcned

 

. 

In an earlier meeting the FASC voted
to support financially and otherwise another
black studies program, the tutorial or
transitional program.

In response to a University statement
concerning “social injustice programs,” a
special committee from the Admissions
area, headed by Bernard Kobosky, newly
appointed Student Affairs Assistant Chan-
cellor and former Director of Admis-
sions, set up the program.

Transitionals are a group of black stu-
dents selected for .admission on the basis
of SAT scores, high school records and / or
recommendations from High school coun-
selors.

A special schedule of studies has been
established for the students who need ad-
ditional services as University students.
It was suggested by the tutorial com-
mittee that the admittees take a pro-
gram of twelve credit hours for each of
their first two trimesters at the Univer-
sity.

Specially designed courses include two
trimesters each of English and remedial
Mathematics, along with one term of Afro-
American History and Psychology, Black
Studies 88.

The Tri-M Scholar Program, going in-
to its second year here, involves another
special admissions group.

At its inception, the program admit-
ted 50 students on the basis of “personal-
ity, group functioning — how the stu-
dent identifies with black people and posi-
tive feelings toward himself,” according to
Dr. Edward Barnes, assistant Direc-
tor of the University Community Educa-
tional Programs (UCEP). V

- Altogether 225 black students out of an
expected 300 have enrolled at the Uni-
versity this Fall. 97 of them are involved
in the Tri-M (Malcolm-Martin-Markus)
Program as first and second year students.
Another 80-90 are transitional admittees.

Hosts °Sell’
I University
To Entrants

by KATHY JOYCE
Staff News Writer

Students with “pride in their univer-
sity” -— the Pitt Hosts has a place for
you. According to Pitt Hosts’ advisor
Miss C. C. Bronder, the program will be

expanded to give all studentsabetter in- ‘

sight into the University community.

The group was “originally formed to
sell the University to prospective stu-
dents” by means of campus tourns, con-
tinued Miss Bronder. Additions to the
curriculum of the tour now include dis-
cussion groups on student activities, prob-
lems, and ideologies.

Tours on campus will be flexible, she '
went on, “to provide specialized tours.

for specific interest groups.”

Miss Bronder added that Pitt Host
President Martha Proco, and Vice-Presi-
dent Bruch Schuster have decided that
members should schedule hosting duties
for two hours a week and that meetings
should be kept at a minimum.

As “official welcomers of the Univer-
sity,” she went on, “plans for the group
also include participation in summer or-
ientations and the operation of tour guide
stations in the campus housing units.” Miss
Bronder feels that with these plans, both
bus tours and walking tours could be
available to the student at anytime.

I’m looking,’’ she concluded, “for the
student who has pride in his University
and is willing put his best foot forward.”

Interested students may Contact Miss
Proco or Mr. Schuster at the Admissions
Office or visit the Pitt Host concession at
the Activities Fair Today or tomorrow in
the Student Union Ballroom.

Our Purpose - Service

The Book Center is owned and operated by the University of Pittsburgh.
The primary challenge facing the Book Center today is one of extending
service to the students of the University, its many departments, faculty,
staff and alumni.

Organizational Structure

The Book Center is a departmental operation. Merchandise or services
offered are catagorized into four given areas or departments. These are
textbooks new and used, trade, supplies and sundries. All buying for these
areas is premised on three basic principles. First the item must be required
for a given course or program of the University. Items of this type are
naturally the textbooks, used books, and paperbacks. Second, trade depart-
ment items are made available that are necessary to supplement and com-
plement the course study and to enhance the cultural and academic signifi-
cance of the University. Third, supply department on the lower floor has
supply items for your every need, paper, notebooks, typewriters, and hun-
dreds of other items. Fourth, sundries department has all the professional
items, engineering supplies, art supplies, records, pens and pencils and the
availability of many items extremely professional.

Newly published BOOKS OF GENERAL INTEREST, both hard cover and
paperback are on the street floor. More than 16,000 paperback and 12,000
cloth titles are displayed in separate sections by subiect catagories. Period-
icals and JOURNALS (scholarly, literary, professional, and technical) are
displayed in this area.

SUNDRIES

This section carries engineering supplies, pens and
pencils, records and many other educational needs.

ART COLLECTION

To the right of the entrance is an area devoted to the
Fine Arts. This section carries reproductions of paint-
ings and other art prints, and reproductions of sculp-
ture and related art objects. The walls here and else-
where in the Book Center enable a generous display
of prints. A

 
 

TEXTBOOKSL AND SUPPLIES

The Textbook Department on the lower floor has a
capacity of more than 250,000 volumes. The books

are shelved as in the stacks of a library. Here, how— 
ever, the arrangement of books is based upon the 
school and departmental divisions of the University.

Supply items for your every need: paper, notebooks,
typewriters, and hundreds of other needed items.
Courteous store personnel are always willing to serve

you, whatever you need.

pushed through innovations ef-

.; If life is a game, then the object should be to
njoy the playing. Man originally invented his
machines to help him play and to give him more
“me to enjoy the sport. But, in the twentieth
entury, it seems the player has lost his impor-
‘nce and that the equipment has became the star.
n .science, the quantity of research becomes
"ore important than the quality; in education,
he degree becomes more important than learning;
nd-2 in technology, the computor becomes more
mportant than the man. But, with the enjoyment
one, is the game still worth playing? ,

The Last Man Is Out, a novel by Marvin Kar-
ns, deals precisely with this problem. On the sur-
ace, it is a story about baseball, about a losing
team’ that is trying to win thepennant. But Kar-
em,-, a former assistant professor of psychology at
e-‘University, has ingeniously turned the story
to an allegory of man’s preoccupation with

With the abolition of the phy-

only 120 credits are now needed
for graduation. The UC authorized
Dean Schneewind to set up ex-

vided that their enrollment

visor and of the instructor giv-
ing the course. Students may now
also take double majors for credit

The Council also approved a

elor’s degree to continue taking

two terms. At the same meeting,
Council members agreed that a
separate review board be set up

er. As Matt begins to realize his life-long dream
of playing in a world series game, he also be-
gins to realize that individual dignity, love and

' even human lives are being nonchalantly sacrificed
for the pennant. ‘He talks to an old groundkeep
er who tells him what the game used tobe like.

“Most of the other owners, you know, think
baseball is a business. They think every thing’s jus-
tified if the team makes a good showing for the
season. But not Samuel. (the former owner) Every
game counted by itself . . . . You've got to keep
playing because its true — the game is never over
until the last man is out. ”

In a mind—chilling and all-too relevent ending,
Matt perhaps the last human man left on the de-

humanized and computerized team, takes a stand to
preserve his own humanity, by standing up to the
computer. But then, when the last man is out, the
game is truly over.

Changes in the administration
also occured. In addition to var-
ious new appointments, three new
alumni trustees were elected.
They are Robert G. Mac Don-
ald. John M. Arthur. and Arthur
J . Brosius.

Freshman orientation was held
— but not as usual. This time, dis-
satisfaction with the regular
program led to a “Disorientation”
and a slightly revised program
with freshmen and upperclass dis-
cussing topics relevent to the Uni-
versity.

Dissatisfaction with society
produced the numerous rallies
and demonstrations. A May Day
rally on the Cathedral lawn,
sponsored by Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society (SDS) stressed the
bond that ‘the speakers hoped
would develop between students,
workers, and minority groups. A
march for Peace and Justice May
24 featured Rennie David from
the National Mobilization to End
the War in Vietnam. The parti-
cipants, some 3,000, wove their

way through Pittsburgh streets to

Point State Park.

While there, the audience
heard Scott Baum, SG president,
read a war opposition statement
that had been presented to the
Duquesne Club in downtown Pit.ts—
burgh that Friday. At the Du-
quesne demonstration 10 mem-
bers of the University com-
munity had been arrested.

The most recent demonstra-
tion occurred during the last two
weeks when the Black Coalition
of Pittsburgh protested the clos-

ed construction unions. Construc- I

tion on several building sites
including the University, was
stopped. At lest two University
members were arrested at the
major demonstration in down-
town Pittsburgh, one for incit-
ingariot.

Innovations Season Summer Term

SDS made the news again this
summer when the University
chapter voted to dissociate from
the national organization.

A boost to “student power” was
the estabiishment of a Book
Center Coop. Under the new set-
up, profits at the end of the
year will be paid as dividends ac--
cording to the individuals
purchase. Students were also in-
cluded in the ad hocommittee
to examine alternatives to the
ROTC program in the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences. The com-
mittee, chaired by Professors
Richard Cottam and Joseph
Zasloff, will report its recom-
mendations to the faculty.

For entertainment, the Univer-
sith Theatre provided Little Mal-
colm and His Struggle Against the
Eunichs, which drew good-sized
crowds and favorable comment.

Speakers like Al Rojas from
the Grape Boycott and Senator
Strom Thurmond presented vary-
ing viewpoints of society and
government.

The campus had its share of un-
constructive excitement as well
when a homemade pipe bomb ex-
ploded in a Tower B dorm room.
Another harrowing incident occur-
ed when three University stu-
dents were assaulted by a gang
of “high school kids.”

But the University involved it-
self in quite a different way with
the “free high school,” some-
thing like Pitt’s Free University.
Several University members taught
informal courses for high shcool
students at the Rodef Shalom
Temple.

Last (but not least) the Univer-
sity hiked up tuition $80 a term.
No summer of change would be
complete without a tuition raise.

‘istence, Hieronious is

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

.‘.Few people can look back on
their lives and see the games
they have played, the others
they have hurt and their mis-
takes. But Hieronious Merkin
did.

In a slapstick mixture of fan-
tasy and -reality, the film now
running at the Shadyside Theatre
offers a structure as complicated
as its title. Can Hieronious Mer-

’ kin Ever Forget Mercy Humpe and

Find True Happiness?

introduces a, forty—year old ac-
tor who discovers that he has
been controlled his whole life by
an unknown “dragon.”

The format of the movie sup-
ports its theme. The flick starts
with a middle—aged Hieronious
showing the film rushes of his life
story to a group of movie moguls,
critics, and his two children and
mother.

Critics offer cruel, “objective”
comments about the content of
Merkin’s movie, i.e. his life.
Writers and directors suggewst
cuts and revisions of assorted
scenes, while Hieronious refuses
to delete (repress) the parts of his

‘life that give him shame.

, For the first time in his ex-
facing
almost ‘objectively what he has
done wrong, for the first time he is
being honest with himself and
for the first time, his adoring
public completely rejects him.

Can Hieronious Merkin

Find True Hap

    

The film within a film traces
the development of the protagonist
from his days as a puppet child
through his emergence as a su-
perstar.

The symbolism in the sequences

is obvious. It is more than ob-

vious; it is playful, paragorical,
devastating. In a series of scenes,
Hieronious literally watches him-

self as his alter ego clad in iron
mask performs.

His major hand up, sex, is hand-
led symbolically throughout the
movie. While still a puppet child

piness?

yearning for a life in the theatre,
the star meets Little Eddie Filth,
a thinly disguised caricarture of
the devil.

As his relationship with Ed-
die deepens, Heronious begins to
change physically from a child
to a sex symbol. The growth por-
tion was sex. But ironically, he
keeps singing the same old song,
literally, in his bit as a comedian-
actor. I

He comes-to realize late in his
lifespan that sex is not the an-
swer, that sex does not make one
a man. But by that time, he
could not change the hurt he had
given to people, the broken hearts,
the female corpses, including that
of his wife and Mercy Humpe,
a child goddess that he had “lib-
erated” and left behind.

His honesty “did not win him
friends and influence people.
Rather, it opened the door for
people to express what they real-
ly thought of him.

The movie hints heavily of auto-
biography. Anthony Newley as
Merkin used his real life wife,
Joan Collins and his own chil-
dren to portray ‘the same roles in

the film.

Hieronious Mei-kin is a very
complex movie. It is colorful,
and obvious, but it is also very
real and painful. If you can trans-
cend the shock value of the flick,
you can come away with a lot to
think about. -

rHunkus is seized with a

, barbaric

  

  age,

by DAVE ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

Good morning class. Today I
will begin a series" of lectures de-
voted to the Homo Sapien forms
that are indigenous to the land
area in and around the University
of Pittsburgh, located in the gar-
den spot of the western hemis-
phere, Oakland, Pa. For the first
lecture. we will be concerned with
the female genre of the species,
known properly as Hunkus Co-
edae.

Hunkus Coedae is an unfortunate
animal that has a life span of only
four years. During its first year
tre-
mendous urge to engage in social
activities with every male of the
species that will acknowledge her
existence, as long as the act of
mating is’ not included in the en-
gagement. Hunkus will also car-
iry her nose at a slant that con-
stantly remains at a forty—five de-

gree angle to the ground she.

walks upon; it seems. however, as
the Hunkus gets older, more des-

parate, or horny for a mate, this

angle depreciates considerably to
the joy of no one in particular.

Duringher initial month of life,
Hunkus must undergo a strange
native ritual known as Lantern
Night. While the details of this
celebration are a
scrupulously kept secret, it is be-
lieved‘ that every Hunkus must
spiritually engage in conjugal du-
ties with the great god of Hunkus,
Pa Pitt. This is the only time of
the year this supernatural en-
tity is worshipped, but what
Hunkus lacks in quantity of de-
votion is made up by her total
lack of quality. It is believed Pa
Pitt is really a ‘girl anyway.

If Hunkus is especially super-
ior (in. herown mind) wears short
hair with a fall, is rich or pre-
tends she is rich, and is either of
Jewish or WASP ancestry, she
will undoubtedly join the elite of
the Hunkus Coedae who form
small, socially obnoxious packs
known as sororities. Once in a

sorority, the first year Hunkus 

will not converse with any Hun-
kus who is less, or more, super-

ior than herself. She will also
limit all social activities to assoc-
iation with males-belonging to sim-
ilar groups called fraternities.
These groups will be discussed
later.

 

‘\

For the remainder of her first
year Hunkus will initiate ac-
tions that are totally. insipid and
completely devoid of any impor-
tance whatsoever. lf -Hunkus has
a short right leg that causes her
to lean in that direction, she will

imbibe alcohol, regurgitate in the .

presence of fraternity males to
gain stature, swoon over pic-
tures of RGTC cadets on the drill
field, cower in fear from any male
whose hair is longer than 1/16th
of an inch, and hate other Hun-
kus Coedae who have short left
legs, known in her vocabulary as
“Disgusting Creatures.” The wit of
the right—leaning Hunkus is bay-
onette sharp.

As for the Hunkus Coedae with a
short _left leg, she will imbibe
grass, drop acid in the presence
of SDS males to gain stature,
swoon over pictures of Cong cad-
ets on the drill field, cower in fear
from anyimale whose hair is less

 

We Amapoam  

than sixteen inches, and hate
other Hunkus Coedae who have
short right legs, known in her voc-
abulary as "Disgusting Crea-
tures.” The wit of the left-lean-
ing Hunkus is every bit as sharp

There is really no sharp dilin-
eation between the first and sec-
ond year of the Hunkus. At the

“age of two, Hunkus merely in-

creases in banality and, doubt-
fully, promiscuity. But precisely
after the third month of the sec-
ond year, the Hunkus will look in-
to a mirror and see what a to-
tal waste she is. It is at this point
that she becomes, what is known
as,"a “political activist.”

This consists of attending ROTC
rallies and being goosed by hy-
per—sexual cadets, or attending
SDS rallies and looking up all
the bigwords in her handy dandy
pocket dictionary that was never
used during her first year of life.

As Hunkus becomes more poli-
tically experienced, she may, if
she thinks for_an hour or two, say
something relevent or maybe (but
donft count on.it) important. This

will happen to most Hunkus Coe-
dae with the exception of the sor-
ority Hunkus who only increases
her unattractive repulsiveness by
engaging in such meaningful acti-
vities as decorating a slab of
chicken wire or desperately seek-
ing a fraternity male to give her a
shiny piece of glass to signal his

future intentions. This sorority Hun-

kus will do anything, even engage
in the dreaded act of mating,
to secure a male companion.

The third and fourth year of
the Hunkus are incredibly sim-
ilar. All actions center around

,mate hunting. Right, left, and

sorority Hunkus die if they be-

lieve they are doomed to a

lonely existence; but by this

time at least they have prob-

ably mated at least once so that

their death is not completely mean-
ingless. In fact, when referring to

death, most fourth year Hunkae

can be heard to say, “I can’t wait

to get out of here.”

by DIANNE ULYON
Staff News Writer
in Consultation with
Dean of Students N. Ronald Pease
Director of University Housing
John Vrana
Chairman of Legal Awareness
Committee Sy Adler

For the first time an attempt is
being made to assure that stu-
dents’ rights are protected at the
University. During the winter and
spring terms the Student Affairs
Social Committee, SG Legal

Awareness Committee, .’Women’sg

Housing Board, Men’s Dorm Coun-
cil, Associate Women Students,
Men’s Council, the Assistant
Chancellor for Student Affairs,
the Dean of Students, and the Di-

rector of Universi-ty Housing have

tried to clarify, and changes
where necessary, University reg-
ulations and establish a judicial
_process.

The following information is the
only available source of the re-

sults of this work in comprehen-

sive form. It would also be advis-

I able for all resident assistants,
mentors, and presidents of organ-

izations to post a copy for use in
fulfilling their duties. ’ ,

While this information reflects
the strides that have been made
toward protecting student rights,
itshould be noted that there is
still a need to clarify some policy
areas; i.e., matters regarding
-double jeopardy, specific state
or federal penalties regarding the
use of drugs and alcoholic bever-

ages, the jurisdiction of campus‘

and city security officials.

REGULATIONS AND JUDICIAL
BOARDS GOVERNING
ALL UNIVERSITY FULL-TIME
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS

Regulations
’ The Student Handbook is the of-
ficial guide to University regula-
tions and will be distributed to

A ‘ freshmen, resident assistants, the
1 president of student organizations,

to Student Affairs staff, mentors,
and the University Information
Center. The Student Handbook will

I * be available later this month; The
’ Pitt News will carry an announce-

ment of the handbook’s availabil-

‘ ity.

The following regulations have
been excerpted from The Hand-
book: ' ‘

ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
University members are expected to abide
by civil laws governing the use of alcoholic
beverages.

a. Only those students over 21 years of j

age will be allowed to possess or consume

alcoholic beverages on campus. ‘

1). Dormitory residents may keep alco-
holic beverages intheir rooms, if they have
registered with the University Housing Of-
fice, Towers Lobby. Such registration re-
quires presentation of a Pennsylvania Li-
quor Control Board (LCB) card.

2). Students over 21 may participate in
University events at which alcoholic bev-
erages are served.

b. Student organizations may serve alco-
holic beverages subject to specific regula-
tions available in the office of the Director
of the Pitt Student Union. 502 SU, ext.
7174. -'
CIVIL PROSECUTIONS

It is generally improper and unnecessary
for a university to duplicate the law en-
forcement functions of the civil state. How-
ever, when a student's behavior makes him

liable to the civil authorities and at the -

same time offends the standards of student
life, University sanctions may be imposed.
DRUGS

The University of Pittsburgh prohibits
the illegal possession, use, or distribution
of marijuana, LSD, or other hallucinogens
and narcotic drugs. This policy arises from
the University‘s concernifor the emotional
and physical welfare of its students as well
as its recognition of the laws of the Federal
Government. the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania. and the City of Pittsburgh.

Any student known to be distributing such

drugs will be dismissed from the Universi— i
ty. The University will not differentiate be- ,

tween violations occurring on and off the
ca pus. ‘ r1‘
he University considers problems asso-

cia ed with the use pf dru s to be persona .

them in that light. All medical and psycho-
logical resources of the‘University will be
made available to a student needing assis-
tance with a personal problem of drug ad-
diction or habituation. When all resources of
the University fail, or when the student re-
fuses such assistance, suspension or dis-
missal from the University may result.
ADVERTISING, SALES,
AND SOLICITATION ON CAMPUS

Commercial advertising circulated on
campus may be solicited only by business
staffs of student publications. Students so-
liciting off-campus advertising for personal
profit may not use the names “University
of Pittsburgh” or "Pitt” in any way that
may associate the University with their en-
terprises. Sale or distribution of commer-
cial products (including free cigarettes) is

" not permitted on the campus or in any Uni-

versity building. Similarly,-no form of ad-
vertisement of commercial products is per-
mitted except in the usual purchased space
in student publications.
‘ FIREARMS

The University considers the personal
possession of firearms'as unnecessary to
an academic community. No student is per-
mitted to carry or have in his possession
firearms of any kind while on the Universi-
ty campus, even when the arms are regis-
tered with civil authorities.

GAMBLING

Gambling by students is not permitted on

University property or in fraternity houses.
SUMMONS BY MEMBERS OF
FACULTY OR ADMINISTRATION

Students are seldom summoned by
faculty or administrative members of the
University. When they are, it could possibly
be for an important or urgent reason. Quite
often such summonses relate to the stu-
dent's family or personal affairs. A student
is required to respond immediately, in per-
son or by phone, to determine the nature
and urgency of the summons.

KEYS

Keys for student activity areas in the SU

may be obtained at Student Office Services,

, 510 SU, upon presentation of membership

card at the organization and a student ID
card. Students may not have duplicate keys
made for use ofothers, nor may they pos-
sess or retain keys to any University door,
file, or facility except with proper authori-
zation.

PHOTOGRAPHS FOR PUBLICATION

Photographs for commercial publication
purposes must not be taken in University
buildings except with the approval of the

University News and Publications Depart- ,

merit.
STUDENT CONDUCT AT PITT STADIUM

Greater efforts are being made to enforce
the following stadium regulations. Anyone
violating these regulations will be refused
admittance or will be removed if his viola-
tion is detected within the stadium.

1. Alcoholic beverages may not be brought
into the stadium_.

2. A person who exhibits disorderly con-
duct or behavior that is injurious to others
will be requested to leave the stadium, or he
may be removed by a security officer.‘

If a student is required to leave the stadi-
um. the officer will confiscate his identifi-
cation card and forward it to the Dean of
Students.

STANDARDS FOR THE EXPRESSION

OF FREE SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY

All members of the University commun-
ity have an important stake in peaceful as-
sembly, in the free exchange of ideas, and
in orderly protest. These values deserve
recognition and protection in a university
dedicated to the challenge of diverse ideas.
University decisions and policies, as well as
political or other issues, may be the subject
of assemblies and demonstrations. What-
ever the subject of protest, those involved
should take into consideration that the same
right which justifies their protest a:so justi-
fies protest also justifies the presentation
'of views by those whom they oppose.

However, assemblies and demonstrations
need not and must not be at the expense of
or cause physical abuse to persons and pro-
perty. They must not interfere with the free
use of, ingress to, and egress from any por-
tion of University premises or with the reg-
ular functioning of the University.

Though spontaneous and un-registered
protest rallies and demonstrations period-
ically occur, it is requested that all rallies
and - demonstrations be registered -24
hours in advance with the office of the As-
sistant Chancellor of Student Affairs. 159
CL. '

OFFENSES TO THE PERSON

A student may not cause, attempt to
cause, damage to the property of the Uni-
versity or to the property of others on Uni-
versity premises.

OFFENSES INVOLVING WRONGFUL

ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY

A student may not obtain anything of val-
ue belonging to the University or on Univer-
sity premises, or attempt to do so, by false
pretense, theft. or other wrongful means;
nor may a student represent himself as an
agent of the University, a student organiza-
tion or as another student for purposes of
personal benefit. except as he may be auth-
orized to do so. .

H  I IDENTIFICATION CARD

The University of Pittsburgh has ism-

lished an institution-wide multipiirpose

,1 . .. . _
iw,,m9ﬁ,°§w...e.i<‘i§atiDfIif2ahsn sllRi~caisrl.q'§le9adua1 Caiairisc

card and a paper term validation certifi-
cate issued each term. Both cards carry a
student‘s name and student numbers and
are required as means of identification
throughout the University.

When requested by University officials.
students are expected to present their ID
cards. Such a request is made only to insure
the security of University premises and to
protect against the unauthorized use of Uni-
versity facilities.

HOW TO OBTAIN AN ID CARD

The permanent blue plastic card is issued
to a student upon enrollment and is valid
throughout the period of matriculation.

The term validation certification is is-
sued each term upon personal presentation
of the blue plastic card and a paid academic
invoice to Student Accounts G-35 CL. Do not
send the plastic card in the mail with pay-
ment of academic invoice.

USE "OF ID CARDS

University identification is valid only
when a student has both cards. Though for
some services, check cashing G-35 CL, use
of athletic facilities, the students may not
be asked to show his validation certificate;
these services can be deniedif a student does
not have the validation certificate. For ad-
mission to University events and voting in
campus elections, the validation certificate
is used to record a student's participation.
Additional uses——recreational facilities in
Trees Hall and SU, identification for off-
campus shopping and check cashing.

LOSS OF AN ID CARD

The loss of either card should be prompt-
ly reported to Student Accounts G-35 CL. A
fee of $5 is charged for replacement. A stu-
dent should also notify the library and other
service areas to protect himself from‘ the
possibility of the use of his ID by another
person. , «

VOIDANCE OF AN ID CARD

The blue plastic card becomes void upon
termination or-interruption of enrollment.
If a student leaves the University for a per-
iod in excess of one term, the ID card should
be returned to the Dean of Student's Office.
Changes in a student‘s enrollment should be
reported to Student Accounts G-35 CL.

MISUSE OF AN ID CARD
A student who has loaned his ID card to

- an individual not enrolled at the University

is subject to verbal discipline or judicial ac-
tion, depending upon the nature of the case.
Though a student could ultimately be denied
his ID card and any privileges in most cases
the ID is confiscated and a student must pay
$5 for a new one.
JUDICIAL BOARDS
The Men’s Judicial Review
Board is composed of two repre-
sentatives of Men’s Dorm Coun-
cil, Inter—F‘raternity Council, and
the Commuter"s Association who
sit on this six member board.
These justices are elected from
their parentrorganizations to serve
one academic year.

The Women’s Judicial Board is
currently being organized by As-
sociated Women Students. It will
be in‘ operation early this term.

Jurisdiction: The boards will hear cases
of any student who is charged with violation
of University regulations which do not oc-
cur in the residence halls or the violation of a
residence hall regulation by a non-resident

student. They will not hear cases involving ’
psychological problems, civil authorities. .

thejurisdiction of residence hall, fraterni-
ty. or sorority boards.

Decisions: These boards may decide any
penalty which they deem just for the viola-
tion once a student is found guilty. They
shall only have the power to recommend
the suspension or dismissal of a student
from the University. A written notice of the
decision, penalty. and avenue of appeal will
be sent to the student involved.

Right to Appeal: A student may appeal a
decision of these boards to the Dean of Stu-
dents. The Dean of Students will in all cases

consult with a students academic dean be-:

fore enforcing a decision to suspend or dis-
miss a student.

licies, regulations. and judicial
boards, contact a member of the

REGULATIONS AND JUDICIAL
BOARDS GOVERNING ALL
UNDERGRADUATE
DORMITORY STUDENTS

General Housing Regulations
The following regulatons have
been excerpted from the Guide to
Residence Hall Living and they
govern those students living in
University dormitories. A student
‘charged with a violation of one of
‘these regulations may have his
case heard before "tli‘e“Men's or
. Women's Residence Hall Judicial
Board or the Director of Univer-
sity Housing. John Vrana.

SOLICITATION of students in the resi-
dence halls is strictly forbidden. Solicitors.
whether they are students or not, should be
reported immediately to the Resident As-
sistant or the Head Resident. This regula-
tion is designed to maintain students’ pri-
vacy and to protect students against frau-
dulent operations. '

DAMAGE to students rooms is always as-

signed to the occupants; if the responsibil-'

ity for the damage is not theirs, it is their
responsibility to ascertain who committed
the damage. Thus, it is to be emphasized
that students are responsible for proper
use of residence hall facilities. Whenever
damage occurs in a student room or to any
equipment within a house, a report should
be made to the Resident Assistant immedi-
ately. University personnel are also respon-
sible for reporting damage whenever noted
(during cleaning or special room inspec-
tions as they may be authorized by the
University). If the University is unable to
assign damage to communal facilities or
the residence hall phsyical plant, there is no
other choice than to assign the responsibil-
ity to the entire living group which utilizes
those facilities or lives in the particular sec-
tion.

ELEVATOR EQUIPMENT is essential to
the operation of the residence halls. Any
tampering, over-loading, or other misuseof
elevators is strictly prohibited and will in-
volve serious disciplinary action by the Uni-
versity.

The illegal use of any DRUGS is a viola-
tion of University regulations, as well as of

civil law and will be dealt with accordingly. 1

Anyone distributing such material will be
dismissed and not permitted on campus.

FIRE SAFETY EQUIPMENT is essen-
tial in the case of an emergency, and there-
fore any tampering with fire hoses, fire ex-
tinguishers, or fire alarms is strictly for-
bidden. Violation of this rule may lead to
dismissal from the University. SETTING
FIRES and using EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
are also expressly prohibited.

SECURITY for student rooms is the re-

sponsibility of the occupants. Each student
should keep to a minimum any valuables he
brings to the campus and doors should be
locked when students are out of their
rooms. Special attention is needed in the
Towers when students leave rooms briefly
to answer the telephone, take a shower, or
visit fellow students in the residence hall. If
a loss is noted, the student should immedi-
ately report it to the Resident Assistant or
policeman on duty at the main desk in the
evening.
' WINDOWS in the Towers are to remain
closed. An open window always presents a
safety problem. In addition, the air-condi-
tioning and heating system requires a seal-
ed building in order to operate efficiently. In
the Quadrangle residence halls, window
screens must remain in the windows at all
times.

The SUNDECKS can present a real danger
in terms of safety, and therefore orderly be-
havior is particularly important in this
area. Any conduct which jeopardizes the
safety of a person on the sundeck or on the
ground below will subject the student to im-
mediate disciplinary action by the Univer-
sity. The sundecks are open only during the

spring term and operate«on a fluctuating’

schedule. No furniture is permitted on the
sundecks, and there must be an attendant
present.

NOISE is always a problem when large
numbers of people live and study in close
proximity to each other. Therefore. stu-
dents are expected to show a certain
amount of courtesy-and concern for others
on week nights, in particular, by refraining
from extended conversations in the halls, by
keeping their record players or radios turn-
ed down, and by keeping their doors closed
if they are listening to music or talking.

ANIMALS and PETS are not permitted in
or around the residence hall.

A HOUSING CONTRACT is signed for
two terms, fall and winter; a new contract
is issued to each resident returning for the
spring term. Contracts may be broken, nor-
mally, only if a student withdraws from the
University. students abroad under Univer-
sity approval of his academic dean, or is
dismissed for academic reasons.

When returning after the dorrs are lock-
ed, a woman will find an officer in the secur-
ity office; he will check her identification;
she will sign her name on the designated
sheet; he will walk her to the dormitory and
let her in.

A woman may leave the dormitory at any
time. When leaving after the doors are lock-
ed, it is her responsibility to be sure that the
door is locked behind her and that she ha
signed out. -

In residence halls such as Tower C, where
lobby doors remain open all night, a desk
man will be on duty all night to handle all
procedures. I

Any registered guest of an eligible stu-
dent receives the same privileges as her
hostess. However, she must sign out her
full name on the guest sign-out sheet. She
must sign in upon her return. When return-
ing after curfew, she must also show some
sort of identification that includes her sign-
nature. She need not return at the same time

HOUSING
JUDICIAL BOARDS

The Men’s Residence Hall Ju-
dicial Board consists of seven jus-
tices chosen by an interview com-
mittee of the housing staff and
students who screen applicants
who have submitted a written ap-
plication and two letters of rec-
ommendation.

The Women’s Residence Hall
Judicial Board consists of five
justices and their alternates. A
similar interviewing process
screens applicants.

Jurisdiction: These boards will hear the
case of any resident student, who has vio-
lated ahe above regulations or those regula-
tions listed in the Student Handbook within
a University Dormitory.

Decisions: These boards may decide any

penalty which they deem just for a dormi— '

tory violation. If the student is found guilty
they shall have only the power to recom-
mend the suspension or dismissal of a stu-
dent from the University. It is, however,
within these boards powers to suspend or

Tuck Shoppe Brighter

by JOY MANDEL
Staff Reporter

The Tuck Shoppe has a new
look this year thanks to the ef-
forts of Sylvia Middleman, a
’69 graduate of the School of
Education. With all the long-term
projects scheduled by Student
Government and the adminis-
tration, Mrs. Middleman decid-
ed that "one of the many small
things that needed doing” should
be brought to the attention of
the student body and the admin-
istration.

In a time of student charges of
lack of administrative coopera-
tion, she found that the use of

"proper channels” was in her"

favor.

However, student support of

the project was necessary to con-

vince Mr. Theodore Bowman of

 

the Physical Plant division of
planning at the University of the
validity of her project, so Mrs.
Middleman devised and circula-
ted a questionnaire to determine
student sentiment about the Tuck
Shoppe.

She chose a questionnaire “ra-
ther than a petition because of. the
uncontroversial nature of the sub-
ject and the fact that so many pe-
titions have been circulated lat-
ely.

A questionnaire gave her an
opportunity to learn more “spec-
ific responses. The results of the
questionnaire appeared in the
February 14, 1969 issue of the
Pitt News. Slightly more than
80 per cent of the students sam-
pled disliked the color of the Tuck
Shoppe Walls.

With this student backing, Mrs.
Middleman sent a letter to Mr.

 

Bowman and waited a month for
a reply before sending another
letter. An interview was final-
ly arranged for Mrs. Middle-
man with Mr. Bowman and an ar-
chitect designer who had been
selected to choose a color scheme
for the Tuck Shoppe.

She learned that it had been ten
years since the Tuck Shoppe’s
last painting.

It was thought that perhaps ‘stu-
dents should have something to
say about the color scheme. A plan
was selected and it was “run
through” a fewstudents. How-
ever, the final planning was left
to the architect. '

According to Mrs. Middleman,
this was a wise decision consid-
ering “the fact that the current
color was chosen originally by a
group of students.” -

’ : Sisyphus In Uniform
O
O
O
: by JERRY GRUEBEL
. Sports Editor
. .
C

When the UCLA Uclans and the Panthers line up
for the kickoff of the 1969 season, new head football
coach Carl DePasqua will pick up where Sisyphusleft
off.

As a result of the coaching derby that began with
Dave Hart’s resignation last November 25, DePasqua
inherited the unenvied task of producing a Panther team
capable of coping with the sucidal schedules the Blue
and Gold face year after year._ But with less than two
weeks of practice left before the first play at the Col-
iseum, the Panthers are not much better equipped to
beat their opponents than they were in each of their
last three dismal 1-9 seasons.

This is not to say that the Jungle Cats are not an
improved team, they are. The turnover of coaches clear-
ed up the cloud of dissention that haunted last year’s
squad. That is particularly evident in the attitude of the
players, and the top physical shape that most of them are
in.

 
 

The Panthers have also learned how to block and
tackle more effectively. Last year, when the gridders
surrendered 2,385 net yards rushing and 1,990 yards pas-"
sing, it was particularly evident that they were bet-
ter prepared for touch football.

This year’s defense is not about to give away 4,375
yards and 393 points, not with that pro-sized front four
that they have in Paul Naponick (6-4,246), John Stevens
(6-2, 242), Howard Broadghead (6-4, 254), and Bob Ellis
(6-2,215). And an improved linebacking and secondary
corps is finally being taught how to tackle.

. But despite the improvement one has to wonder how
much better off the Panthers will be this year.

“We’re up against teams that are better than us
when you compare their players with ours, one by one at
each position,” admitted DePasqua, “That presents a hell-
uva problem.”

How many games can the Panthers hope to win with
the UCLAs, the Oklahomas, and the Notre Dames dom-
inating the schedule again this fall‘? The answer isn’t a
very pleasant one for rational Panther followers.

Last year, the opposition scored an average of al-
most 30 points per game more than the Panthers. All
but three of last year’s opponents return to claw the De-
Pasqua - led Jungle Cats, this fall. it seems more reas-
onable to hope for a successful season in terms of nar-
rowing the margin of defeat.

“One degree of success,” explained DePasqua, “is
progress in building a foundation.”

If any crew of coaches could build such a founda-
tion despite the presentathletic program at the Univer-
sity, DePasqua and his experienced assistants appear
qualified for the task. But with the schedule as it is, it
seems doubtful that they can lift the gridders above
that foundation this fall. DePasqua just might have the
same kind of task Sisyphus had in Hades.

  
     
   
   
     
     
   
   
   
       
   
   
      
    
     
     
     
     
   
     
       
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
     
     
     

"Western Pennsylvania” Style

by ED CONLEY

In the late 1940’s when Carl
DePasqua was playing every-
where in the Panther back-
field, he was also enrolled in a
Logics class. The DePasqua strat-
egy for his first season as head
coach of the same. grid squad
would indicate ‘that he hasn’t for-
gotten some of the lectures.

“Pitt is in Western Pennsyl-
vania, Western Pennsylvania has
its own style of football. So, Pitt
will play Western Pennsylvania’s
style”—-that’s DePasqua’s idea.

“You take a_ look and you see
that Pennsylvania boys are all
over the place; it’s the hot—bed.
You see the individuals with coal
dust behind the ears,” reasoned
DePasqua.

“The other coaches like the
boys from around here. They’re
the tough players and the opposi-
tion knows they’re in for a war
when they face them.”

This type of thinking means that
the Panthers will stay on the
ground this year, banging into the
line more often than not. Keeping
the ball on the ground may reduce
the dreadful total of interceptions
suffered last season, but DePas-
qua is not forgetting about a pass-
ing attack.

“You never forget your quar-
terbacks. We’ll be minimizing
their responsibility, and we’ll do
our best with them,” he noted.
“We have no real experienced
men, and none of them have ever
been under fire.”

DePasqua has to talk about his
quarterbacks (plural) because he
is undecided as to whom his start-
ing signal caller will be in the sea-
son opener against UCLA Sept.
20. The top man last year, Dave
Havern, will miss this fall’s ac-
tion because of a bout with mono-
nucleosis.

That leaves the battle for the
all-important position up to Jim
Friedl,. Chuck Winters, Frank
Gustine, and Ray Reppert, and all
DePasqua will say is that “I’ve
got those four.”

One good — reason for the new
mentor’s inability to find the best
man for the job is the fact that his
offense hasn’t had an abundance
of “big moments” against the de-
fense in the scrimmages.

But DePasqua stresses, “The
defense always has the upperhand
this early. One advantage the
defense has is that the offense

.,a.  J  f:I,

DePasqu.,»9 Panthers Tm.-

\

has only worked with seven or
eight plays. So the defense knows
what to expect.

“The initiation is good, though,”
DePasqua said. And the attitude,
it’s extraordinarily well.

The

CARL DePASQUA
New Style

players understand what J the
coaches want. They understand.
the formula.”

The players aren’t the only ones ’

who have to adjust, however. Al-
most all of DePasqua’s assistants
are instructing these athletes for

the first time, and the entire group j-

of mentors is entering its first
year as a unit.

“It’s just a matter of knowing]

the system,” DePasqua mention-
ed. “You teach it. And, I have
some real fine teachers.”

The new assistants are Lou

A “Bimbo” Cecconi, Tom Fletcher,

Serafino “Foge” Fazio, Paul_
Kemp, and Charles Gottfried. The
one returning coach is Steve Pe-

tro, tutor to the defensive tacklers. - f

But DePasqua is the most im-

portant “teacher,” and he brings 

plenty of experience into what he
knows is going to be a big strug-
g1e.- His most recent experience

came as the defensive line coach

for the Steelers last year.

“That pro experience helped, .

but any experience helps,” he stat-

ed. “As you are learning, you’re -

progressing, and so much the bet-
ter.”

DePasqua and his crew are hop-

ing their players will progress,

with any experience gained in
practice because a plan may be

logical on paper, but it may not 2

work on the field.

Frosh Gridders Await Work

This fall marks the first crop of DePasqua-recruited foot-
ball stars. and the limited number of 1969 Cubs will soon learn

the DePasqua style from frosh grid coach Bill Quinter.

Only 18 freshmen gridders
and Quinter doesn’t expect more
than about ten to 12 walk-ons.
But a 30-man squad is nothing
new to the Wheaton, Md., native.

Quinter played professional
football in Canada for five years,
and in that league the squads nev-
er totaled more than 31 men.

Quinter can also boast of a long
list of other football experience
which seems to make him more
than adquate to handle his post un-
der DePasqua. He was a three-
year letterman at the University
of Indiana, where he played offen-
sive and defensive ends. He also

received scholarships this year,

Quinter began his coaching ca-
reer as offensive line coach at In-
diana State of Terre Haute. While
he and Bimbo Cecconi directed
,the Indiana State offense last
year, the team won nine of its ten
contests and averaged better than
30 points per game.

“Well try a power attack," ex-
plained Quinter. That was the
style offense used at Indiana State
and that’s the same strategy De-
Pasqua wants to use for the varsi-
ty and frosh this fall.

“The freshmen will be doing

.the same things a;S.ﬂ¥¢_varsit’y,” _ A
  andaInen!f1‘la5.?m; , i _ 

    

'3

u

:said Quinter, “but they

basic fundamentals even more

than the varsity. We had a sound '
(at Indiana '

offense last year
State) because of the basics, good
blocking mostly.” ”

The Cubs will practice onthe
All-Purpose Fields‘ behind Trees‘
Hall, and for the most part they’ll
be working apart from the varsi-
ty. But that plan will inevitably be
abandoned once the Panthers see
action. The grueling football sea-
son usually results in a long list of
injured gridders.

When Quinter is not busy with
the frosh, he will work with the
varsity offense. ‘During the spring

ANALYSIS BY MARTHA HARTLE

Sept. 20

    At UCLA

 A After suffering his first losing season in four years at UCLA
.  ‘._ last year (3-7), Tommy Prothro promises that his Bruins will be
 ‘  better in '69, “with real improvement in the offensive line and
 _ ~ atquarterback.”

The improvement at quarterback may come from experience
.. ‘and depth, if nothing more, with the return of last year’s two
1 _ top signal callers, senior Bill Bolden and junior Jim Nader. Both
W - were effective against the Panthers last year as Nadar tossed
;f;j-'~ _"_ ﬁfour touchdown passes while Bolden passed for one and ran for
 ‘ another before being sidelined with an injury. The starting job at
 I ‘quarterback, however, may go to junior college transfer Dennis
' «-  Dummit,a 1968 JC all-American.

  The Bruins will also be strong on the ground with two year
_ vet Greg Jones running at half and powerful Mickey Cureton at
_ full back.

‘ _ On defense, Prothro claims he’s worried about the secondary,
5. -' = but three junior college transfers should ease his worries. Other-
 ‘ wise the unit appears strong, with tackle Floyd Reese and line-

 L backer Mike Ballou the strickouts.
  _At Oklahoma ‘ Sept. 2 7

Oklahoma’s advance publicity expresses concern over incon-

 
 

 

   
  

 I” - sistency in the offense, but with All-American and Heisman tru- -

 ‘ _phy~candidate Steven Owens in the backfield it’s hard to label
  ' the offense inconsistent.

, Owens is supposedly bigger and quicker than last season
when he ran through enemy defenses for 1,536 net yeards. He
 .needs only 331 yards this season to break Gale Sayers career
‘mark in the Big 8.

_ But Owens is not the only Sooner .threat. Tight and Steve

Zabel (6’4”, 235) is also a strong all-American candidate and soph

quarterback Jack Mildren completed 62 per cent of his passes
' last season guiding the frosh to a 4-0 mark. Center Ken Mend-
 allhall. a second team All-American selection, is big and quick
 and will anchor the offensive line.

». Defensely, the Sooners are strong all around and will go to a
.~ .-more aggressive type of play as opposed to the containing type
‘  _ which coach Chuck Fairbanks employed over the last two seasons.

,._At Duke Oct. 4
I‘ ’ ’ There’s optimism in the Duke camp and the main reason for
 -this optimism is Leo Hart, an all-conference quarterback last
year as a soph. Hart’s total offense credentials last season were

'_..-the sixth best in the nation as he broke 12 school and confer-
’ ‘ ‘ence marks.

_ Hart will have plenty of targets as well as the Blue Devils
have a crop of experienced receivers returning. Wes Chesson, Jim

"Dearth and Marcel Courtillet accounted for 1,509 of the team’s
2,653 passing yards last year.

Inexperience and lack of depth dominate the defense, how-
ever, especially at the end and tackle spots. All-conference line-
A backer Dick Biddle is the top defensive man, while soph Rich
A __'Searl, who intercepted eight passes in five frosh games last year,

‘  should help strengthen the secondary.
~’  Navy Oct. 11

The Middies have a new coach in Rick Forzano, but the prob-
-'lems will‘be much the same as last year when they plunged to a
. 2-8 mark. Only sixteen lettermen return from that team and four
of these have been lost to the team for the season, already in-
cluding top defensive man Rich DeCario. There is an evident

' P lack of depth, experience and size at most positions. »

‘, Forzano cites his receivers as the team’s strong point yet _of

g ‘the three top men, only Scott Monson has game experience and

_ even he has never caught a single pass. There’s experience in the

backfield, but little of it. Mike McNallen returns as the signal

caller and co-captain Dan Pike leads the rushers. Pike gained
 500years last season.

_ _ Defense is still a big question mark, as several offensive line-
:men have been moved over and a number of sophomores are al-

A so tagged for starting roles.

At West Virginia Oct. 25

The athletic department put down a new carpet of Astro
turf in Mountaineer Stadium over the summer, but there’ll be
a lot of familiar faces around to break it in. Twenty of 22 starters
return from last year and Mountie fans are predicting the best
team in the school’s history. '

The same old passing duo of Mike Sherwood to Oscar Pat-
rick returns and that in itself is a chore for opposing defenses
to handle. The Sherwood-Patrick duo broke 14 school records in
’68 as Sherwood finished 14th in the nation in passing. In a rec-
ord breaking performance against the Panthers be connected for
416 yards through the air.

In addition to Patrick, Sherwood will be throwing to wing-
back Wayne Porter, full back Jim Braxton and tight end Jim
Smith. Head coach Jim Carlen found the running game weak in
the spring, but it should be adequate with Braxton, EddieCSil-
verio and Bob Gresham all returning.

Ten of eleven starters return on the defense which held the
Panthers to 15 points last year. Middle guard Carl Crennel is
touted as one of the nation’s best at his spot. —

Nov. 1

Ben Szchwartzwalder has produced 19 straight winning teams
at Syracuse and this yea r’.s edition should be no exception.

Graduation took a heavy toll on. the defense, which ranked
as fourth best in the nation last year. Art Thoms and Tony Ky-
asky are the notable losses, but 12 lettermen from that unit do
return. The Orangemen suffered a blow, however, when it was
learned that All-East end Lou Gubitosa will miss the entire
campaign due to a leg operation.

Ten of eleven offensive starters return, including fullback
Al Newton, who was the leading‘ rusher last year as a soph,
quarterback Paul Paolisso, who passed for almost 1000 yards, and
tight end John Massis. Paolisso, however, underwent leg surgery
in the spring and was still hobbling on crutches last month.

The Orangemen will be big, strong and experienced and they
could challenge Penn State for top honors in the East if they stay
healthy. '

Syracuse

Notre Dame Nov, 8

Don’t weep for Notre Dame. They lost Terry Hanratty, Jim
Seymour, George Kunz, Bob Gladieux, Coley O’Brien et al, but
don’t weep. Ara Parsegien always seems to come up with some
type of offensive weapon and it’s doubtful this year will be any
exception.

This year’s weapon may be Jeff Zimmerman, or Joe Theis-
man or some green soph named Andy Huff. Zimmerman was in-
jured most of last season following a fine soph campaign, while
Theismann was impressive in filling in for the injured Hanratty
at the end of last year.

And if the offense scores, you can bet the defense will do
its share. Eight starters return, including 270 pound giant Mike
McCoy, and linebacker Bob Olson, both of whom are tagged as
All-American candidates. Teaming up with McCoy on the big
Irish line will be 260 pound letterman Bob Jockisch and 240
pound Pat Mudron. The secondary is also experience. The Fighting

At Army Nov.‘ 15

Gone are Mr. Everything quarterback Steve Lindell and All-
East fullback Charlie Jarvis along with eight starters on defense
from last year’s.7-3 squad and coach Tom Cahill has only 15
lettermen and a sub-par crop of sophomores to plug the gaps.

Co-Captain Lynn Moore will move over to Jarvis’ fullback
spot and will be the top offensive threat. Quarterback is still up
for grabs. Two year lettermen Han Andraejczak returns at one half-
back spot, while Bill Roden has the inside track on the other
running slot.

. Irish will be tough again.

The defense lacks an individual standout and will be inex-
perienced, but despite all the apparent problems, the Cadets
will most likely finish with a winning record due to the peren-
nielly weak schedule.

Penn State Nov.. 22

With a 19 game winning streak on the line, the Nittany Lions
have the potential to go undefeated again this season if they stay
away from major injuries and stay hungry for victory.

The defense should be one of the best, if not the best,. in the
country with nine of eleven starters returning. All-Americans
Mike Reid and Steve Smear give the Lions the best pair of de-
fensive tackles in the nation, but Paterno must find replacements for
his two graduated ends, Spaziani and Lipponcott.

All-American Dennis Onkontz leads a strong corps of line-
backers, while the secondary returns intact.

Ted Kwalick and Bob Campbell will be missed on offense,

but all-American candidate Charlie Pittman should be the best
halfback in the East. There’s a lot of depth behind Pittman. Quar-

terback Chuck Burkhart will be throwing to Greg Edmonds,_Wa_yne

‘Valli Of Hope

  

‘With Naponick, Broadhead, Stevens, Ellis

by MARTHA HARTLE
Associate Sports Editor

“No one knows what the Pitt football team is going to do this
season but at least the defense will have a professional look in size
as well as in the style of play up front,” the Pittsburgh Press.)

All through pre-season drills, on - lookers have been siz-
ing up the Panther defensive line. literally. And there's plen-

ty to size up.

There's an abundance of beef and muscle up front this
fall, and there's plenty of game experience to go with it. The tenta-
tive starters on the front four right now average 6’3". 230 pounds and
, three of the four are returning letter winners.

Tackle Howard Broadhead
and end Paul Naponick are the
giants on the line with Broad-
head weighing in at 248 and Na-
ponick tipping the scales at 230.
Naponick, a two-year veteran,
trimmed off 15 pounds during the
summer and is looking forward
to a good year. “This is my last
year and I hope it’s a good one,"

quipped Naponick. “I’d like to give
pro ball a try if I can."

Beoadhead, who was redshirt-
ed last season due to an ankle
injury, is beginning his first sea-
son with the varsity and has mov-
ed right in to challenge for a
starting role. Broadhead reinjured
his andle last week and was out

of contact work, but should be
back in action in a few days.
Like Naponick, the Middletown,
New York native has hopes of
reaching the pro ranks some day,
but “I have to take things one at
a time. But I have about it (pro-
ball) ever since I played
ball,” commented the big tackle.

Flanking Broadhead at the
other tackle spot on the line
will be either Bruce Harkiewicz
or John Stevens. Both are jun-
ior lettermen and both saw con-
siderable action last year. Stevens,
a former Big 33 star from Sharon.
is 6’2”, 242 pounds, while Hark-
iewicz measures 62’, 227.

Two-year vet Bob Ellis, a
quick 6’2”, 215 pounder, is hold-
ing down the other end spot. Ell-
is has been one of the top de-

Spicko’s Goal--To Be Among Top

by MARTHA HARTLE
Associate Sports Editor

It's much too early to make
any predictions about the ’69 Pan-
thers, but it’s almost a certainty
that much of the team‘s fortunes
will hinge on the toe of Joe Spic-
ko.

Spicko, a junior from Green-
ville, Pa., is the team’s kicking
specialist and will be handling
both the punting and the
placement chores this season.
“Hopefully, I’ll be handling all
the kicking,” he explained.
“My leg is in good shpe and
I’ve spent most of the practice
sessions working on my punting
and kick-offs.”

Last seast, Spicko was the 22nd
leading punter in the nation with
a 40.6 average. At one time, he
ranked sixth, but “due to the num-
ber of times I was punting, there
was more opportunity for bad
kicks” and his average suffered-.
“I hope we reduce the number
of times we have to punt this sea-
son. “I hope we reduce the num-
ber of times we have to punt this
season, and I think I’m capable of
improving on my average. I’d like
to be among the top punters in the
country.”

When the Panthers meet UCLA
in two weeks, Spicko will be
matched against one of the
best punters in the country in
Zeno Adrusyshyn, who ranked
first in the nation two years
ago, and fourth last season.
“That’ll be a challenge for me,”
Spicko continued. “I’d sure like
to top him.”

In addition to kicking for dis-
tance and average, Spicko is
noted for his high, towering
boots. “I’ve worked on the height
of my punts,” he explained.
“Good height comes mostly from
bringing the leg through the

9 ball and then following through.”

Although hoping for less
punts, Joe admits that he hopes

he added. “Accuracy is the main

Gold the past two seasons.

Naponick and Ellis are not
without competition, however, as
Jack Dykes. Lloyd Weston and
Fred Tolhurst all battling for
starting roles. Weston is a convert-
ed linebacker. while Dykes has
been moved from the offensive
line. Both Dykes and Weston
weigh in at about 240. Tol-
hurst. a tall, lanky senior, (6-5.
226) has been plagued by injur-
ies over the past two seasons.

The Panthers will be play-
ing a .4-3 pro-type defense this
year, with the defensive ends play-
ing right off the shoulder of the
tackles. The physical size should
provide a formidable wall to oppos-
ing offenses, but only time will

ductions this year.

natural thing and there's not a

With two years of college ball
still ahead of him, Spicko
would eventually like a shot at
the pros. “Right now, I’d have a
better chance as a punter, but I

Not only will all games be play-
ed on University fields this year, —
but the completion of lighting in-
stallations over the past several
months will permit the inaugura-
tion of night athletics.

For many years the University
has been far behind other schools
in providing proper facilities for
operating an intramurals pro-
gram outdoors, limiting the lM’s
potential for growth. The acquisi-
tion of the new playing fields. lo-
cated behind Trees Hall, opens the
door not only to increased partici-
pation but also to expanding the
current IM program.

With the acquisition of the new
playing fields the University has
failed to meet one of the most
critical needs in any athletic pro-
grams; the need for safety. Al-
though the fields have been well-
leveled and well lit, the surface of
the field itself is something less
than desirable.

Any student who has had the
misfortune over the summer
months to play ball on the new
fields, probably has learned of the
disaster which awaits anyone dar-
ing to slide on the sand-gravel
type surface. The nature of the
sand-gravel material does not al-
low anyone to secure any type of
firm footing while running.

The football intramurals will be
even more hazardous than that of
softball.

 Brightens Picture For Fall As AS Harriers Train’:

Booters Sharpen For Bucknell

by BOB LEDERMAN

Coach Leo Bemis is a hap-
py man these days. Not only
does he have the use of the
former grass - covered football
practice field for his booters, but
he also has an abundance of en-
thusiastic, talented soccer play-
ers.

Thanks to a fine recruiting job
during the past six months, Bem-
is has gotten rid of a depth prob-
lem that has plagued his team
over the last season. In addition,
the newly allowed eligibility of
freshman players guarantees the
booter’s mentor plenty of reserve
ability in case of injuries.

“Last year,_ depty was really
a problem,” lamented Bemis.
“We’d have three or four fel-
lows out with injuries and we’d
be hard pressed to fill spots. Now
with freshmen eligible to play, I
can see no real depth problems.”

The new Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Conference (ECAC)
ruling which places freshmen in
eligibility this season, will not be
in effect for at least one or two
games during the fall campaign.
Although the new ruling when
voted upon was passed by a maj-
ority voice, a few schools with-
ing the conference refused to ac-
cept it. One such school, Buck-
nell, will be the booter’s first op-
ponent when they open the 1969
season at home September 20.

In practice sessions this year,
unlike in the past., coach Bemis
focused on barl control and
playmaking. Last season, the em-

pnasis was placed on condition-
ing.

“This year we’re doing every-
thing in practice with the ball,”
explained Bemis. “We haven’t
even been doing wind sprints. I
think that we can be in good
physical condition and also be a lot
sharper in execution if we do all
of our running with the ball in
practice.”

Overall, the current 45 man
squad appears stronger than that
of last year’s 3-7-1 squad. The
major difference this season be-
ing the eligibility of a large num-
ber of freshmen ball players. The
additional able—bodied soccermen

Without the services of their two best runners, Jerry
Richey and Mike Nolan, the cross country team is in a des- 
perate situation. As the season approaches Coach Jim Ban- . 
ner will have to rely heavily on a bunch of enthusiastic fresh-
men and his three seasoned veterans, Mark Vornhagen,. Craig

Rogers and Ken Bulky.

Richey, who had both legs
operated on last summer for hern-
iated muscles is working out
very lightly and most likely will
not participate in a meet until
late in the campaign. Mike Nol-
an, also on the injured list, is
now in the process of receovering
from a severe fever. He too will
be ready by the end of the sea-
son.

“The team is training as if
Richey were not running at all,”
commented Coach Banner. “The
attitude is excellent and every-
one has a winning spirit.

The cross country squad has
to face stiff competition in this
Fall’s campaign. The harriers
will open against Kent’State and
Ohio University on September 20.
At the Ohio University field.
Late in November they will
travel to both the IC4A and
NCAA _championships in New

York City. The season comes to a ‘

close with the National Federa-
tion meet at Penn State Novem-
ber 26.

Despite the loss of Richey and
Nolan, Banner is optimistic
about his team's chances. “The
only problem is that we don’t
have enough time before our
first meet on the twentieth.” At
present the team meets twice
a day for practice, running an
average of twenty miles a
day.

All the cross country courses
range from four to six miles long.
The championships are run for
a distance of six miles. Banner
hopes to enter as many runners as
he can into the competition.

From a field of as many as
300 runners, with almost 25
teams competing, only the first

Shaw Ex-Marshall Mentor
Appointed Banner Assistant.

by a Jack Shaw, a head coach at Marshall. '

The thirty—one-year-old Shaw,
a native of Kane, Pa.- will be in
charge of field events under
head coach Jim Banner.

“I’m extremely pleased to
have such a good man joining our
program,” Banner said. “I’ve had
nothing but high recommenda-
tions on him. and I’m sure he’ll
be a big help to our program.”

about selecting diamonds?

ucts, selecting a diamond is most like choosing.-_._-__  .
A. a watch B. Savings bonds C. a steak D. a new car

Here’s bow to score your answers. (But
please, don’t read any further until
you’ve answered all tbe questions to
tbe best of your ability.)

I'll!

1. If you checked answer “D,” you’re abso- clearly written little booklet, easy to un.

color of their own whatever. They merely blaze
’ iwith all thecolors of the light that enters them.

  
    

lutely right. The ﬂnest diamonds have no

If you checked “Blue-white,” be careful. The term
is fraught with many meanings and loopholes. It is
used as a sales aid by some jewelers to help sell diamonds

I of inferior color. Because “blue-white” is inexact and mis-

leading, we forbid the use of this term in referring toiany

' diamond at Hardy & Hayes.

2. If you checked “ﬂawless,” you’re right again. A ﬂawless dia-

pmond is not necessarily a “perfect” one, however. The Federal

Trade Commission’s ruling on the use of this term states that
besides being ﬂawless a diamond must not be of inferior color or
make. There really is no such thing as a “perfect” diamond.

, Like the term “blue-white,” the term “perfect” is forbidden
at Hardy & Hayes.

» 3. You are right if you chose answer "B.” Diamonds are cut in
. different styles, ,such as round, oval, etc. There are Ideal angles

and proportions for each style.’

» ‘When a professional refers to cut, he is talking about the
human factor of a diamond’s beauty. Just how well has man done
his job? If the cutter deviates from the precise angles and propor-
tions of the Ideal, your diamond would have less beauty and
should therefore cost you less than a more precise cut.

“4. If you chose any one of the four C’s, you’re partly right. A
diamond’s value is determined by all four.

The price you pay for a diamond includes more than the value
of the gem itself; the value of the ring or other setting, for in-
stance. A portion of the seller’s cost of doing business also is in-
cluded, as is his proﬁt.

Because all Hardy & Hayes diamonds are obtained directly,
via New York cutters, from the London sights of the Central
Selling Organization (marketing arm for all jewelry diamonds
in the world) our price does not include the profits and expenses
of intermediate brokers, wholesalers or agents. For this reason,
you often pay less at Hardy & Hayes than you would elsewhere
for a diamond of comparable quality.

Judge for yourself. We’ll give you a booklet* that explains
how the various characteristics of a diamond are rated and
how the professionals compare one diamond with another. It's a

_,__J

 derstand. We’ll answer any questions you
may have and, if you have time, show you
examples of the characteristics you’l.l want to
watch for.
Then shop around.

5. Buying a diamond has something in common with all
four possible answers, of course. Watches and automobiles,
being manmade, can be standardized, however. You can usually
expect one new car to perform as well and ride as comfortably as
another of the same make, model and equipment. But nature
never does anything quite the same way twice. I '

Savings bonds have but one variable——their size, or dollar
value. You look at the denomination and you know what each
one’s worth. Not so a diamond. ‘

Selecting one is thus most like choosing a steak. No two are
quite alike. Price per pound (or carat) is only one of several
considerations. Color and clarity are as important in a diamond
as tenderness and ﬂavor in a steak. And cut, certainly, is vital to
both.

Of course, one way to be sure of getting a good steak is to go to
a good butcher. \We’ll spare you the rest of this analogy.

If you got four of tbe five questions right, your /enowledge of A

diamonds is above average. But even  you missed only one, it
would be wise to find out all you can about diamonds before
you actually invest in one. We’ll bedeligbted to /yelp you learn
as much as you care to. Don’t feel you’d be imposing. After all,
tbe more you know about diamonds,’ tbe better for us.

booklet the day we get your card.
