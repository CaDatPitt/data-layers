Labor board hearing may not be  
necessary in United Facultydispute

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

in a recent series of meetings, the
United Faculty group and Pitt's ad-

L ministration have come closer to

solving their differences without the
need for litigation.
The United Faculty, formed two

years ago, is seeking recognition as.

the collective bargaining unit for the
Pitt faculty. If the meetings are suc-
cessful, the hearings before the PA
Labor Relations Board at the end of
this month will be unnecessary.

’’I’m very heartened by the prog-
ress being made,” said Lewis Popper,
legal counsel for the University.
”However', some difficult problems
remain to be worked out.”

Philip Wion, a Pitt professor in the
English department and organizer for

the United Faculty, agreed with Pop-
per about the progress.

”We’re working on a description
of'the government system for the
university. I'm sure we'll reach an
agreement,” Wion said. ”We are go-
ing to argue that Pitt faculty, accord-
ing to state law, are professional
employees, not managers.”

Management employees ‘are not
permitted by law to form a collective
bargaining unit.

Popper said the faculty participates
in the governing of Pitt to an extent

..that they should be considered

managers.
’’If the faculty were to unionize, the
university would be deprived of their

- managerial abilities,” Popper said.

Wion countered, ”Faculty all over
the country have _ had collective
bargaining for years. The faculty and

administrations develop a com-
plementary relationship. I think that
[Mr. Popper's] comment is complete-
ly unfounded."

Wion said that the union would
give the faculty a greater degree of
control over the decisions affecting
them.

.”At the Faculty Senate meetings,
we [the faculty] are consulted but the
decisions ultimately come from the
administration,” Wion said. ”That
puts us in a subordinate position.
With a union, we would be more
equaL”

However, Popper said, ’’If the
faculty were to unionize, it would
lead to a polarization of interest for

them. They would become adver- _

saries in a certain sense. I think there
would be a separation of |oyalties.”
Popper's main concern is that the

union would break the university in-
to a class of rank and file employees
and a class of administration.

’’I think it would seriously mar the
quality of government at Pitt should
the faculty be removed from the
governing body,” Popper said. ’’It
would be detrimental.”

Wion said,”The faculty is constant-
ly put in a position of having to ac-
commodate the administration. We
have no recourse/"

There will be a meeting today be-
tween the attorneys and represen-
tatives of both sides to agree on the
remaining issues under discussion-so
that PLRB examiner Elliot Newman
can reach a decision on the legality
of the union's position.

”We are certainl-y making progress;
I'm sure both sides are going to reach
an agreement,” Wion concluded.

Sigma Alpha Mu fights drunkdriving

By Bill Murray

For The Pitt _News

Two Pitt fraternities have joined
Brothers Against Drunk Driving, a
program to educate high school stu-
dents about alcohol use and abuse.

The organization formed six_

months ago when Phi Gamma Delta
expressed concern with the number
of high school alcohol-related deaths.
Fiji members asked all Pitt fraternities
to actively participate in the program.
However, Sigma Alpha Mu was the
only fraternity to respond, and the
two are now working together.
The BADD organization at Pitt is
trying to reach out and explain the
responsibilities of drinking to area
high school students. ”We’re trying
to become a big brother image rather

than an authoritative figure,” said
Todd Safranek, one of the Sammy
chairmen.

Unlike the Mothers Against Drunk
Driving organization, which is
against alcohol abuse, BADD is try-
ing to teach common sense. The
brothers at Sammy are also trying to
explain to the high school-age crowd
that there is more to college than just
going to parties and drinking.

”You can have fun at college and
not drink,” said Joel Slesinger, a Sam-
my brother. ’’I think dry rush was a
good example of that.”.

The BADD organization, which is _

still in its infancy here at Pitt, is try-
ing to educate its members. Lawyers
have visited the Sammy fraternity and
have explained some of the implica-

tions and liabilities of having parties. -

They have also visited Inter-Fraternity
Council meetings and explained
what might happen to a fraternity
should a law suit be brought against
it. ’

Sammy brothers Matt Tolbert and
Tom Growchski gave BADD presen-
tations to local church and camp
youth groups in Lancanster County
over the summer.

”Often, youths are threatened by
parents and teachers to stay away
from alcohol,” said Tolbert, ”which
naturally makes [them] tempted to try
drinking. The tremendous peer pres-
sure out there doesn't help either.
Tom and I have conducted these ses-
sions to give youths the opportunity
to express their feelings about drink-

ing in the presence of their peers and

ask questions about alcohol.”

Tolbert said that the results this
summer were very positive. ’’If we
could change the attitudes of kids in
Pittsburgh, like we did with the youth
in Lancaster, about drinking, I doubt
they would ever drink and drive.”

Right now Sammy is working in
conjunction with the West Penn AAA
and members of the Western Psychi-
atric lnstitue to try to prepare for the
visits to area high schools, planned
to start later in the fall. The program
which would ideally be in full swing
for the upcoming prom season is still
in its infancy. However, the members
are very optimistic about visiting the
high schools.

At the present time, Sammy and Fiji
are the only two fraternities involved

in the BADD‘program. They would

ficials speculated the action would af-

fect the stance of Pitt's board of 

trustees on divestment. A

The board's present stand against
total divestment has sparked a con-
troversy throughout the university,
and many await the outcome of the
board's vote on the issue at the Oct.»
l4 meeting. . ’

Pitt President Wesley Posvar said ’

he supports the governmental sanc-
tions ”as the only effective means‘
that pressure can be put on South
Africa.” However, he said,”The ques-
tion ofdivesting the small number of
stocks and investments that the uni-
versity has with certain corporations

is really not going to effect the situa- .

tion.”

Posvar was unwilling to predict the
effect, if any, the Senate's decision
may have on the board's eventual
resolution of the question.

”They’re going to have to get the", ‘

committee report and make their
decision then,” Posvar said.

Barbara Sizemore of the black
studies department said she is
pleased by the Senate's decision, call-
ing it ”a signal to South Africa that
the United States is a champion of
freedom and civil, social, human and
political rights.”

She said she is unsure of the effect
the decision will have on the board, ’
but she hopes the trustees will ”take

the lead of Congress and vote to --

divest.”

Sizemore speculated, ”!'m sure
that some board members, if they had"
to choosebetween money and
freedom, even their own, would.-.
choose money.” '

Posvar disagreed with Sizemore’s ‘— ‘

speculation.

Rezoning
postponed

The consolidation of the Pitts-
burgh Police stations, which
would redefine zoning, has been
postponed indefinitely, according
to local police.

The controversial consolidation,

would move Oakland's Station
No. 4 to Squirrel Hill.

In a memo dated Oct. 2, Pitts-
burgh Police Chief William
Moore said, ”The Oct. 6, 1986
consolidation of the stations is
rescinded,” according to Station
No. 4 officer Jay Fuller.

According to the memo, ”The
[Fraternal Order of Police] and the
Bureau of Police are working on
a plan that will simplify the tran-
sition.”

The consolidation of stations
has been placed on hold until the
plan is finalized.

 

S dieon Soviet nuclear sub firein Atlantic 9.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon
said that U.S. Navy-planes spotted
smoke coming from a crippled Soviet
nuclear sub early yesterday morning,
but the smoke later died down.
The Soviets said a fire aboard the

- ‘submarine killed three people last Fri-

day. The sub began moving under
her own steam but later stopped
some 400 miles east of Bermuda.

A Pentagon official said a Navy
ship is standing by and is available
to help — even to tow the submarine
if necessary. Three Soviet merchant
vessels are also near the sub, ap-
parently as part of the rescue
operation.

A Reagan administration spokes-
man said the Soviets may have been
thinking about this week's summit
when it quickly announced the news
of the fire. The Soviet Union told the
White House about the blaze early
on Saturday morning.

‘U.S. and Soviet officials said there
is no danger of a missile accidental-
Iy firing or radiation leaking from the
sub, which is carrying nuclear
weapons.

Reagan endorsed
anti-terrorism plan

WASHINGTON — A report in the
Washington Post said President

- Reagan approved a plan that em-

braces a wide range of covert,
diplomaticand economic efforts to
discourage Libyan-sponsored ter-
rorism.

A State Department memo dated.

Aug. 6 suggested a plan to exploit
Moammar Gadhafi’s paranoia that
could lead to ”a coup or assassina-
tion” of the Libyan leader.

The plan that Reagan finally en-
dorsed, however, made no reference
to encouraging the overthrow or
murder of the Libyan leader.

The White House issued a state-
ment last week on the matter that
said, ”support for assassination in any
form has never been and is not now
a part of administration policy.”

President Reagan and Secretary of
State Shultz also denied that the
White House lied to the U.S. media
about a ”disinformation” program

against Gadhafi. /

Shultz said any misinformation
given to the media was done ”against
policy.”

Some senators believe that a U.S.
disinformation campaign against
Gadhafi has undermined the ad-
ministration’s credibility.

Israel manufacturing
weapons, report said

LONDON — A London newspaper,
The Sunday Times, reported that
Israel ranks as the world's sixth-
largest nuclear power, even though
Israel denies that it manufactures
nuclear weapons. I

The report said Israel has spent the
past 20 years secretly putting together

we

as many as 200 nuclear weapons.
Israel reportedly hid a nuclear
warhead factory from spy satellites by
burying it under a harmless-looking
building next to a desert nuclear
power plant. By-products from the
plant's reactor are allegedly used to
make the nuclear weapons.

The report was based on 9
photographs and testimony from a
laid-off employee at the power plant.
‘Israel is not commenting on the“"‘

worker was employed at the atomic j

plant.

The Wisconsin democrat said the

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 6, I986

By Dirk Kaufman

Managing Editor

John Walker is the man behind
the Panther snarl.

While the cheerleaders go about
the business of urging crowds to
root for the team, the Panther
mascot entertains. More than a
cheerleader, Walker provides
humor and interesting distractions
for the crowd. I

”It’s very different than most
people realize,” Walker said.
”Everything you do is being
watched by someone, so you have
to be doing something all‘ the
time.” ~

He has been the mascot since
last year, taking over for Troy Lar-

' son, who joined the cheerleading_

squad.

As with most entertainers,
Walker develops a feel for the
crowd, learning what they most
enjoy. He said his attitude during ’
the games depends a great deal
on how the crowd is acting.

”At the Big East tournament last
year, the whole place was really
behind us," he said. ”They were
really cheering because we were
the underdogs and were still doing
pretty well. That was the best time
I've had being [the] mascot.”

Walker rarely goes into the
stands during the games. Fans
have damaged. the suit in the past,
and because of the padding he
wears and the limited vision from
inside the Panther head, he isn't
aware of the damage.

The task of entertaining up to
60,000 people is something he
has grown accustomed to.

Pitt's Panther
The man behind the mask

"It was very awkward atfirst,"
he said. ’’I was intimidated by the
crowd. 4

”I really have to keep thinking
of new things to do,” Walker con-
tinued. ”When the game is on tel-

‘ 

You reach a point
where you just can't
get any more tired, and
you go on after that.

evision, it seems like they have a
camera assigned to you.

"What bothers me is, I don't
know what's on TV and what

_ isn't. A lot of times I walk away

from it [the camera].”

Since he is not sure who is
watching, Walker doesn't recall
many particular instances of em-
barrassment. His most embarrass-
ing moment came during his first
game, at Temple, last year.

The crowd, unknowingly, found A
- it humorous.

”Temple had parachutists com-
ing down on the field, and some-
one told me to go out and join
them,” he said. "I ran out there,
and onerof the parachute strings
got caught underneath my helmet.

"The guy didn't know I was
caught, and he was dragging me
across the field. I was cut on the
back of my neck, and all this
blood came out. No one really
knew what was going on, and

_ they thought it was funny." ’

What he does on the field is up

to him. Walker comes up with his
own gags each week, trying to
make himself more entertaining.
He will occasionally put on roller
skates before the game has begun
and roll around visiting children
and fans as they come into the
stadium.

”The children are a lot of fun,"
he said. "They're the ones 1 ap—'
preciate the most."

While on the field, he occa-
sionally joins the cheerleaders.
Though he is not always around
the squad during games, he goes
to practice during the week and
works out with the squad.

The head of the Panther is ac-
tually a covered football helmet.
Underneath the suit, Walker wears
a chest pad and usually shorts and
a T-shirt. It means an extra load
for him, and a lot oflost weight
throughout the season.

He said he initially lost 10
pounds, but his weight now re-
mains consistent. Through a three-
hour football game, he gets a
thorough work-out.

”You reach a point where you
just can't get any more tired, and
you just go on after that,” he said.

Though he has another year of
school after this, he is not sure yet
if he will be returning. Walker
said if he is able to make the
squad he would like to be a
cheerleader next year.

Being the mascot is enjoyment
enough for now.

”A lot of people say, ’Hey,
that's something I'd like to do,’ ”
he said. "I just wanted to do
something that had to do with
Pitt.” ’

Homeless man  
says he threw awayv

opportunities;

, By Frances Sansig

Sta ff Writer

I met a man named Forbes this
Sunday. He lives in Pittsburgh, as he
has_ all his life. _

I met him at a bus stop. He was sit-
ting hunched over, just enough to
hide his wrinkled face and chilly blue
eyes. I asked him .if he knew what
time it was, and what he thought of
the weather. It was sleeting outside,
the first sign of imminent bad weather
I had seen this fall. 6

Forbes and I went to have coffee
in the lounge of the William Pitt

Union. He began reminiscing about ‘

the days when it was the Schenley
Hotel — when he used to bring his
girlfriend there for ballroom dancing.

”I had a lot of gooéftimes in my
life,” said Forbes.

At 69, he is part of the homeless
population of Pittsburgh.

He's been that way for a month
now. It wasn't that he didn't have
enough money. He gets Social
Security and two other pension
checks, which total about $600 a
month. He said it had something to

do with an alcohol abuse problem he,

once had.

”I haven't had a drink for over a
year and a half. I haven't lived in an
apartment for a month, and the
reason is between me, myself and my
landlord,” .he said.

He told me a little bit more about

He said that's where Welk got his

said things were a lot tougher back
then, but he was fortunate. "

"My father and mother built a

I went to'Westminster."

”I was a» sergeant with the Marine

Forbes said he started drinking after
the war. ’’I was at Vet's Hospital three

He said this was not the first time
he has ‘been without a place to live.
”My mother died in 1975. I lived.
with her until then. When she died,
I got even worse [his problems with

C’mon SGB, let's

 see you do more

’’As far as I ’m concerned, it's the media '5 job to inform the public."
— SCB President jim Mumma
Oct. 2, 7986

Yes it is  and we did. I -
We informed the public of the inactivity of the Student Govern-

ment Board. We stated it last week, and we will state, it again.

On Friday, the SGB informed us that it was "spending considerable

- time and effort carefully allocating the student activities fee." Bravo.

The*SGB is also ”investigating" the possibility of implementing an
escort service for late-night studiers. Also, it is "involved in main-
taining the academic quality of the university by being involved in
the selection process of the new provost and by investigating prob-
lems with members of the‘ faculty. _ I
. ”In addition, student government is working to counter apathy and
increase awareness by encouraging student involvement in this year's
bicentennial celebration through voter registration drives and by spon-
soring programs designed to increase voter awareness during this elec-
tion year,” said Mumma. -

The Pitt News has not witnessed any SGB-sponsored voter registra-
tion drives, and even if it had, how would voter registration drives
increase student interest in Pitt's bicentennial celebration?

Furthermore, allocating the student activities fee is a yearly task
for the SGB, nothing out of the ordinary.

Where was the SCJB when Pitt students were being taken advan-
tage of in the weekend war zone two weeks ago. After the media
informed the public of the situation at the corner of. Forbes Avenue

. and Bouquet Street, the police finally took action —— the situation was
' remedied. '

The SGB should not settle into a pattern set for it by previous boards.
Instead, it should attempt to make new strides in representation of
the student body. ' ‘

  We need our own

stadium lighting

It was a great game on Saturday. A little'moist, but the fact that
it was a night game made it almost tolerable. This was the second
night game so far this season. The fans seem to prefer them to day
games, and night games apparently are more successful from a finan-
cial point of view. There's an excitement in the air at night that's just
not there in the afternoon. '

The idea of installing permanent lighting in the stadium has been
a hot topic of discussion among administrators, students and fans alike
for the last few years. Everyone seems to be in favor of it, so why
don't we have it yet? The cost is almost prohibitive and there are pro-
blems with the stadium itself that would make the installation dif-
ficult. But Pitt has overcome obstacles in the past, and we can do
it again. The time is right to install permanent lights in Pitt Stadium.

If the previous night games we've had are any indication, revenue
and attendance will increase: And that's what it all boils down to.
Football is a business, and the athletic administrators have to do as
much as they can to make our home games as profitable as they can
be. Permanent lights are an excellent way to make all of the necessary
increases in attendance and profits for which they've been striving.

The national press has become a fairly well—estab|ished audience
member in the past few years. When we're not being covered by
any of the three major networks; local TV and syndicated broadcasters

are generally there. Because of this, we have an obligation to show

off our school. Rented lighting does not do so good a job at this. It
makes us look cheap. We look like a school that can't afford to be
in the big leagues. Even though that is not the case.

So, if we're going to be "in for a game” let's make them night games
—— games with Pitt's own equipment.

I am a second-year student here at
Pitt. Being an upperclassman, I have
grown "accustomed to the laughter
and joy that "Bloom County" has
given me. But alas, "Bloom County”
has gone the way of Foge Fazio and
can no longer be found in The Pitt
News. Why?

Who is Zippy? What is Zippy? Why
is Zippy? The man looks -like a
refugee from The Upstage. Being
from simple, hard-working folk,
perhaps Zippy is beyond my limited
abilities to understand [him]. On the
other hand, (and I suspect this is the
case), could it be that Zippy is a lame,
inane comic strip? Zippy is about as
enjoyable as Math 23. I laugh at Zip-
py about as much as I laugh at my
tuition bills. And who is Bill Griffiths,
anyway? A recently released Western
Psych patient? - . '

Why not bring back ”Bloom Coun-
ty”? Or replace you’-know-who with
a popular strip? After all, this is a mat-
ter of Panther pride. Just think (God
forbid!) if Penn State had a better

’ comic strip than Pitt did’? I got enough

abuse from last year's game, thank
you. -
Oh well, maybe this isall a bad

' dream". I'll awake from my slumber

shower, crazy 35 €V€I'.

Dry rush

Well, it was a long two weeks, but
the fraternities survived one of their
most controversial challenges: dry
rush. Although the doomsayers
speculated that fall rush would be\a
disaster, the results, based on tradi-
tional objective measures, indicate
that it was actually very successful.

Four traditional criteria are used to
measure success: the percentage of
registered "rushees who pledged/asso-
ciated, the total number of pledges/
associates, retention of pledges/
_associates and scholarship. In terms
of the first measurement, there has
been a significant increase over the
last two fall rush periods. In fall 1984,

'32 percent of the registered rushees

pledged/associated. In the fall of
1985, that figure dropped to 25 per-
cent while this fall it shot up to 40
percent. Not bad for a start!

As for the total number of men who
accepted bids from fraternities, last
fall 198 became pledges/associates,

cle ”Coalition for /Literacy seminar
addresses problems of illiterate at
home and abroad,” the statement,
"nearly 40 million people in America
and one billion in the world are il-

literate". was attributed to me, Alice 1,

Scales. I cannot take credit for that
statement. However, I would like to
offer an explanation of how such
statistics might be true or false._
Statistics regarding illiterates that
we have heard on TV and have seen
printed in newspapers are estimates.
Such estimates depend on the man-
ner in which literacy is defined. If we
define literacy as all people who have

completed 8th grade, then that group '

of people who have not [completed
8th grade] are illiterate. If we define
literacy as all people who have com-
pleted 12th grade, then we have
room to count many more illiterates
than we could count for_ the 8th-grade
ceiling. By using a variety of defini-

tions to define illiterates, we could
generate statistics that might be con—-

sidered true or false.

My response is not meant to
diminish the problem of illiteracy but
to add some clarity to how ‘statistics
might be generated to account for the
number of illiterates in the world. -

I believe that the Pittsburgh Police
did a great job in diffusing the crowd
along Bouquet Street in Oakland last
Thursday. There were at least two
fights along. the street in a matter of
five minutes, and if not for the quick
response-timesof the police, things
could have gotten quickly out of
hand.

I have one complaint, however,
and this goes out to the owners of
Zelda's and CJ. Barney's. I had been
standing just outside Zelda's talking
with friends.when the police started“
to clear the street. We decided to
comply by going into Zelda's. My
friends went inside as I stopped to
talk withvanother friend. Then when
I went to the door, I was not allowed
admittance. Funny thing, since I was
the only one over 21 in the group.
When I inquired why I was not al-=
lowed admittance, I was told that I_
was involved in the fighting! That was
news to me, but there was no reason-
ing with the bouncer at the door. I
then decided to go to C.J. Barney's,
but when I got there, they would not
let me in because, "I got thrown out
of Zelda’s." I tried to explain that I
had not even been in Zelda's, but
once again this was futile.

Well, they say the third time is a
charm, and thank God for Caleco’s
for both carding me and allowing me
to spend my money in their estab-
lishment. ‘

while this fall the figure was 193. As
a matter of fact, the figures for the last
four fall terms have been rather con-
sistent. With the first term ofdry rush
behind us, the fraternities are sure to
do even better next year.

The last two measures of success
have yet to be taken, but their impor-
tance is worth noting. Measuring the
retention of pledges/associates, that
is, the percentage initiated as
members, provides an indication of
the quality of and the effectiveness of
the mutual selective process that
begins with r_ush events and culmi-
nates with initiation after participa-
tion in chapter education programs.
We're willing to bet that more
pledges/associates are initiated than

usual

' Finally, there is scholarship. Al-

though it is premature to draw a
cause-and-effect relationship be-
tween dry rush and better scholarship
as measured by chapter grade point
averages, it is believed that the
aforementioned results will have a
positive effect on chapter academic
performance.

Let's put all the quibbling aside for
a moment and face the facts. Not on-
ly does dry. rush work —— it also makes
sense. By emphasizing the positive

aspects of brotherhood without the ’

use of alcohol, we not only proved
to the university community that
there is more to fraternities than
drinking beer, we also proved to
ourselves that we could successfully
rush without alcohol. So what's the
problem" with dry rush? If we allow
the results to speak for’ themselves,
there doesn't seem to be any.

THE PI1T NEWS, Monday, October 6, 1986

The biggest news coming out of the
U.S. Open tennis tournament was the
first-round defeat of John McEnroe.
McEnroe lost in four sets to a relative
unknown named Paul Annacone.

McEnroe, who used to be the top-
ranked player in the world, was
described by reporters as distracted,
listless, tired, lacking in energy,
sparkless and old.

The "old" part is what many
writers stressed. They said that
McEnroe will never again be able to
be a dominant force in tennis; they
said thathis time has passed, and that
it is time for younger players to take
oven

McEnroe is 27 years old.

In Chicago, in a development that
received far less national publicity
than the McEnroe defeat, a football
player named Brian Baschnagel was
cut from the roster of the Chicago
Bears. _ ‘

Baschnagel was an eager, en-
thusiastic player who seemed to be
universally admired by the men with
whom he played. He was in good
health. He had been playing ex-

Callinga spade a spade isnot mudslinging

This column is addressed to SGB
president, Jim Mumma, to those peo-
ple who enjoyed my piece from last
Wednesday and to those who didn't.
Neither I nor The Pitt News at-
tempted to discredit the Student
Government Board, nor conduct a
personal assault on President
Mumma..Hopefully, this will be the
last word said in the Pitt News vs.
SGB matter.

The impetus to write my column
last week was to let people know
what I thought about the SGB. My
opinion has not changed, especially

after Mr. Mumma’s letter attempting 

to vindicate his organization and
himself, but that isn't to be addressed
now. What should be addressed is
the reaction and name calling that en-
sued after last Wednesday's Scandal-
ous Attack. Did Mr. Mumma think
that a nasty letter and some heated
phone calls would change the facts?

During the ride on the 11:15 p.m.
Amtrack to New York City, we
stopped at a small New Jersey station
just outside north Philly. Three new
passengers boarded there. One was
Bruce Springsteen. _

The seats on Amtrak passenger
coaches are designed to maximize a
rider's comfort. A passenger has ple_n-

'ty of leg room between each seat row
while the seats themselves are
upholstered with a soft, gold, fuzzy
fabric and can recline to 1 5 different
positions. I'm positive it's 15 posi-
tions because I was fooling around
with my seat’s adjustment control
counting each reclinement position
instead of noticing Springsteen sitting
down in the seat across the aisle from
me.

He wore his characteristic faded
blue jeans jacket along with a gray
pair of cords and a white oxford shirt,
and he propped his dirt-stained Ree-
bok sneakers on the foot-bar attached
on the seat in front of him. I didn't
notice him propping his Reeboks on

the foot attachment either because‘

my attention was focused on count-
ing the six various positions to which
I could adjust my foot bar. Night train
rides, you see, usually bore me.

The other passengers in the train
compartment, however, did notice
the Jersey rock god.

By the time I bothered to look up
from my foot bar I still hadn't noticed»
Springsteen. I did, however, notice
half of my fellow train passengers
lined up in the aisle to my left, armed

cellently during pre-season drills. The

only reason he was cut was because

of his age.

Baschnagel is 32.

That must be the most melancholic
feeling for an-athlete .— being judged
an old man while other men of his
age, in other professions, are still be-
ing thought of as whiz kids. If
McEnroe or Baschnagel did anything
for a living other than play profes-
sional sports, they would just be
entering the stages of their careers at
which their talents would be
recognized and rewarded.

Baschnagel told a reporter on the
day he was,cut, "The thing that
frightens me is I don't know if I'm
ever going to be able to find anything
I can enjoy as much as playing foot-
ball."

BOB GREENE

For athletes who leave their sports J

while still in the primes of their lives
— as they all do —— that thought must
indeed be a scary one. You have to
figure that when a professional
athlete has to step down because he
is too old, that is probably the first
time in his life that he has been told

I don't really know the guy, but I had

hoped that the person representing

me had a little more political savvy.

I thought that I had called a spade a

spade, and that the actions after
Wednesday's publication only
proved this to me. I made a sugges-
tion to Mr. Mumma in my column
which he deemed a personal attack.
I made my suggestion to Jim
Mumma, the SGB president, not to
Jim Mumma, the clean-cut guy you
seetrotting around campus.’ Most
readers saw this, but President
Mumma didn't. If he plans to con-
tinue his political endeavors, he must
realize that anybody in so visible a
position as his will be scrutinized by
the press. Why did Richard M. Nixon
have such a rough time with the
press? Why did John F. Kennedy have
such a good rapport with the press?
The answer lies not in their perform-
ance as president of the United

with scraps of newspaper and torn
pages from Amtrak magazine along
with a colorful variety of crayons
some little girl up front had generous-

ly distributed from her Crayola box .

to those lacking a writing utensil.

Naturally, I was curious who was
doling out the autographs. That's
when I noticed Springsteen sitting
across the aisle from me, signing his
name furiously with a green Crayola
crayon.

About 10 minutes later, Bruce had
finished signing his last autograph
with a weak smile still on his face.
From up front I could hear some guy
excitedly informing hisunconcerned
elderly mother, "The Brhskie, mom!
I can't believe you don't know who
Springsteen is!” To this she respond-
ed calmly, "I'm sure he's a nice boy,
Tom."

The rest of the passengers in the
compartment were either still gawk-
ing at the rock god with their mouths
opened as wide as their unbelieving
eyes, or still sleeping in their comfor-
table Amtrak seats with their mouths
drooping open too.

My mouth belonged to the former
group of passengers.

The god turned to glance at me,
then his eyes focused on my face. He
spoke with a grin. .

"Has your mouth always had that
problem?”

I immediately shut mytrap. My
neck had never turned so crimson
faster or redder thanat that embar-
rassing moment.

he is not good enough. If you make
it to‘ the pros, that probably means
that you were never cut in grade
school, in junior high school, in high
school or in college. You were
always a certified star.

So, after 20 years or more of being
among the best of the best, it has to
be a very uncomfortable feeling
when, for the first time, you're on the
outside of the playing field looking
inithrough the fence.

Springsteen looked out the win-
dow again at the New Jersey night
rushing by and then turned back to
scan the train compartment, his eyes
darting from passenger to staring
passenger and then to the still-
gawking me.

''I guess you want my autograph,
too, right?" he asked me.. ' —

I don't have many days when a
rock star speaks to me, the lad whose
only public appearance closest to
MTV was when I was 10 and had to
speak one line on the live Sunday
morning Magic Cocoon show (broad-
casted locally to farmhouses
everywhere in south central Penn-
sylvania) that I still forgot despite
hours of rehearsals when my moment
came. Naturally I was not
accustomed to seeing, let alone talk-
ing to, one whom housewives across
America revere more than their own
children.

What made my situation even
more awkward was that I don't like
Springsteen. I mean, he is a pleasant
guy and all, but I cringe when I listen
to his monotonous lyrics_and rasping
singing voice. I'd rather change sta-
tions and put up with Madonna.

So I told_the god the truth.

"Not really,” I said.

i The camaraderie alone has got to
be a wrenching thing to give up. If
you're an athlete, you spend your en;
tire life in the company of other peo-
ple who do the same thing that you
do. If you're a John McEnroe, those
people are the other tennis profes-
sionals on the world tour. If you're
a Brian Baschnagel, those people are
your teammates in your football club.

You eat together, you travel to-
gether, you virtually live together.‘
Your performances appear on na-
tional television, and your name and
your photograph are constantly in the
newspapers. There is a lot of current
talk about drug use among athletes
—- but it's hard to imagine that any
drug could be more mood-altering or
more addictive than the drug of sim-
ply living the life of the pro athlete.
Probably you get used to it, but there
still has to be an aspect of getting up
in the morning and hardly believing
that all of this has happened to you.

So what do you do when you're
John McEnroe, 27, or Brian Basch-
nagel, 32? In McEnroe's- case, he

got bad press, thus a bad public im-
age. Take heed Mr. Mumma. This is
to what Ernest Hemingway referred
in the phrase, "Grace under
pressure."

In the midst of the mud slinging,
several accusations were made
against The Pitt News, particularly
the perspective section editors. It was
said that The Pitt News never
covered the proceedings at SGB
meetings. The Pitt News had actual-
ly been told by the SGB that there
was nothing of great importance go-
ing on. This information was the in-
centive to investigate the SGB in the
first place. Then, Mr. Mumma’s
"Presidential Address," printed last
Friday, came back with claims like
"fighting student apathy." I know
few, if any, students who wake up in
the morning and thank Mr. Mumma
that they feel less apathetic.

Springsteen's lips parted, which for
a rock god probably represents one’s
mouth falling completely agape like
those of thepassengers listening to
our conversation, and then quickly
pursedthem. "Why not?" he asked.

I told him another truth. ''I can't
stand your songs.” ‘

The god grinned. "Can I ask why?"

"I go to school in Pittsburgh, where
the radio stations play your music
over and over and over again until
your songs sound dead and my head
is on fire from your dull moaning
lyrics. The radio stations overkilled
your stuff, Mr. S——”

"Bruce," he interrupted with a
warm smile. "Just call me Bruce.
Everyone does."

I grinned, still feeling a bit embar-
rassed but now more comfortable
talking with him. My soft, comfor-
table Amtrak seat helped loads.

"You know,” he went on, "very
few people tell me they don't like my
music these days. I remembera time
when if an audience didn't like one
of the band's songs, they'd toss bot-
tles at us. Now everyone supposed-
ly loves our music.”

"Almost everyone,” I reminded
him. _ '

Bruce laughed softly at that remark,
which deeply pleased me. Not many
people have the opportunity to make
a famous singer like Bruce laugh.

"Could I ask you a question, .-

Bruce?" Using his first name didn't
come easily. Using his last name
wouldn't have felt much better either.

"Old before their time”, —— trite but true»

most likely never has to work another I of"

day in his life; his winnings and his
endorsements no doubt have made

him financially secure many times 

over. In BaschnageI's case, he will
have to go out and get a full-time job.

In both of their cases, though, they ' :2

will have to deal for the rest oftheir
lives with the public’s perception of
who they used to be. When they are
40 and 50 and 60 — the ages at

' which most men are approaching the

peaks of their careers — they will still
be answering strangers’ questions
about what they did when they were
little more than boys.

McEnroe may end up making
television commercials parodyinghis

former on-court manner; Baschnagel -

may go on to be.a genuine success
in business. But neither of them will
likely forget the summer of 1986,

when they both paid the price for A

their unforgivable crime.

That crime was to grow old in-a  '
world with a separatetimetable from

the one the rest of us are allowed‘ to
live with. The sentence is life.

C’mon, let's wake up and smell the
coffee. The Pitt News wasn't on a
witch hunt. After the articles were
printed, a former prominent SGB
figure commented that the articles

were factual and was pleased that ‘J
something had been done to promote

student awareness. Instead of taking
the criticism as areason to improve
themselves and their image, they

took the easy way out and claimed '

persecution.

,

As I said, I hope that no moremud
is slung. That promotes nothing.
What I do hope happens is that the

SGB buckles down and improves ‘

their performance, not just going
through the motions of the mimimum
requirements. . -

By theway, I still hate soggy Cap'n

night. I

maybe, if he hadn't made it big as a
singer, he could have lived a life like
yours and mine.

Bruce nodded his head. "What are
you doing on this train?" I asked.
"Don't you have your own private jet,
or limo to take you to New York?"

"I’m doing research," he said with
a quiet smile.

"Ah, then perhaps there is
something I find admirable about
your music.” ,

"Why thanks. ..." he paused. "I
never got your name."

"Matt."

And then instinctively and instan-
taneously we both extended our
hands across the aisle and shook-
them. ,

We talked a little longer, and then
Bruce spent the rest of the ride sleep-

ing while I psyched myselfto see my 

girlfriend waiting for me at Grand
Central. When our train finally ar-
rived, Bruce waited in his seat while
I anxiously jumped into the aisle. He
smiled at me one last time, and lsaid
with a wave, "Take it easy," and I
made my way out of the train and in-
to Robin's waiting arms.

Students pour on the pre-game spirit

By Eric S. Poole
Staff Writer

He called himself Harpo Jack, and
he looked frighteningly like Max the
dog in his reindeer garb in The
Grinch That Stole Christmas. I
couldn't resist. I had to ask — even

. though I knew that I would regret it.

”Why do you have those tree
branches tied to your head?”
”It’s in honor of the beginning of

‘ archery season tomorrow [Sunday]/’

said Harpo. ”I’m the only 20-point in
Pittsburgh.” '

Tailgate parties can literally be a
circus. Last year's Phi Delta Theta
_Pitt-Penn State tailgate featured a big
top-style tent andeightkegs of beer.
”We brought our own furniture and
bought a quarter of the parking lot
[behind the Syria Mosque],” said a
gentleman who identified himself as
Crash.

Typically, the Phi Delts rent four
spacesin the Syria Mosque parking
lot. I was looking for the best tailgate‘
there, and the U—Haul that they had
rented seemed pretty good. Once I
reached the U-Haul’, I encountered a
huge keg cooler. -

”This isn't one of the bigger parties
because everyone knows that Pitt is
going to win," said Crash. ”The
Miami tailgate will be a really big
one. -

’’Another reason might be that it is
Parent's Day, but |"d'just bring mine
along.”

The Phi Delts also plan to journey
tr. the Happy Valley tailgate for the
Penn State game. ’

”We have a really big chapter
there,” said Crash. “Jack Ham was in
the Penn State [chapter of] Phi Delta
Theta." -

Penn State, incidentally, has a
reputation forincredible tailgate par-
ties. But Paul, another Phi Delt

brother, ‘ corrected that miscon-
ception.

”They have food there,” he said.
”That won't work; it dilutes the ef-
fects of the alcohol.”

Sure enough, there was no Food at
the Phi Delt party — just beer, and
more beer, diluted only by the Old
Grandad in the flask of an avid
tailgater.

The brew of choice for the Phi
Delts was Old Milwaukee. The main
consideration for that choice was, of
course, price.

The ” Old Swill,” as it is known to

Pitt students, went for a little more

than $20 a keg.

By the time I got to the tailgate, one
of the three kegs was empty.

On the tailgate of the U-Haul sat
an official-looking man.

”You look like you're in charge,”
I said, and then introduced myself. It

turned out to be Crash, and he wasn't
in charge.

Then the Phi Delts revealed their
secret weapon — a third keg, cool-
ing inside a red cooler which
resembled a miniature grain silo.

I then met an obviously refined
gentleman named Sloth Jr. (of slight-
ly lower rank, I assume, than Sloth
Sr.). He was complaining because the
beer was too cold.

”You can’t chug it ’cause it burns"

your throat,” he said.

A few minutes later, the empty
cooler (and the keg inside) was
loaded into the U-Haul for storage
until after the game. Paul left to see
the Pitt Panthers lose $25 for him.
(He had a bet with a friend of Harpo
Jack.)

Speaking of Harpo Jack, I hope he
remembered to get those tree branch-
es out of his hair.

was sold. After living in another
apartment for a short period of time,
he stayed at a shelter in East Liberty.

Now that he no longer has an
apartment, I asked him how he
passes the time. '

”l’m not doing much of anything.
I play the numbers on the lottery. I
just niissed it the other day.”

He confessed he isn't really happy.

Forbes said he is looking for a place
to live. ”This time of year, the
weather's been lucky. But that's no
excuse to be sleeping outside,
especially when you know the clif-
ference between right and wrong.
The thing that makes it worst of all
is the fact that l had the opportunities
and threw them away.”

He doesn't want to drink anymore,
but Forbes said he has lost the ambi-

tion and persistence he needs to get

his life back together.

He said the homeless in America
are like the people in Calcutta — they
exist from day to day.

Maybe you've seen Forbes. Or.

maybe you've seen someone like
him.

”There’s a lot of people a hell of
a lot less fortunate than me,” he said.

Next Wednesday: A look at what
kinds of shelters and rehabilitation
centers are available-for people like
Forbes, both nationally and in
Pittsburgh.



I  WI1y Be A
Do-Gooder?

Quakers are chronic do-
gooders. The government
adopted our scheme for prison
education 100 years after it was
started as Quaker volunteer
work. There was a Quaker
plan for state endowed medi-
cine 250 years before Medicare.
Quakers worked to abolish
slavery 175 years before Aboli-
tion.ﬁAnd the checker-board
pattern of American cities was
originally based on Quaker
town planning, on the principle

What started all this?
William Penn said, ‘True God-

liness does not turn men out of
the world, but enables them to
live better in it, and excites
their endeavor to, mend it."
Friends are not apologetic
about being do-gooders. They
don't feel that they have to
"justify" helping others in need,
working for a just and fair soci-
ety, or endeavoring to bring
aboutpeace in the world. "Do-
gooding" is serving that of God
in every human". It is a way of

life.

good is not so bad? If so, per-

THE PITT NEWS

Splish, Splas  

Pitt
takes

a bath

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer ’

The Pittsburgh Panthers were on
the rise, slowly establishing"

‘themselves as a force in the world of

eastern college football. In their two
outings prior to Saturday's game, Pitt
had rung up 89 points in sacking and
pillaging Purdue and West Virginia.
Both of those games were first-quarter
struggles which evolved into second-
half laughers. Coming up on Oct. 11
was a trip to South Bend and a battle
with Lou Holtz's ever-so-popular
Fighting Irish.

Enter Philadelphia Bruce and his
Temple Owls of Doom.

Pretty silly but, hey, so was Pitt's
performance in Saturday night's
19-13 monsnoozer of a loss to Tem-
ple. Earlier in the week, the same old
coaches’ pre-game dialogue had hit
the media. "Temple is a tough foot-
ball team,” Pitt coach Mike Gottfried
said at Tuesday's football luncheon.
”They have great skill-players and
their quarterback is experienced.
We're in for a tough football game.”
Right,. and-so were Penn State and
Brigham Young, who trounced the
Owls 45-15 and 27-17 respectively.

The case here was probably the old
"looking back — looking ahead” syn-
drome. The Panthers were coming off
of a big win, and Notre Dame was
just around the corner. Pitt may have
been resting on their Laurels, while
these Hardys from Temple came in
and knocked their blocks off.

Whatever the cause, the Owls
outplayed Pitt and had no business
doing so. Nationally, the Panthers

No.7 inAmerica way too high forPanthers  

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Last Thursday, I was walking home
to" my apartment, and‘asil walked
down Forbes Avenue, I stopped by
Gus Miller's Newsstand to gaze at the
new tabloids displayed in the
window.

Something caught my eye im-
mediately. Sport magazine has its col-
lege basketball preview issue out
already. On the cover was a familiar
face, Syracuse's Rony Seikaly. So I
decided to stop in and take a look.

Being the big Pitt hoop fan that I
am, I was anxious to see if the Pan-
thers were rated in the Top 20.

Don't ask me why.I would think
such a thing. Remember,- Pitt finished
sixth in the Big East last season with
a dismal 15-14 record.

But as I turned to the basketball
section, a weird sensation passed
through me. Something told me that
I would see the Panthers ranked in
the Top 20. Then I saw something
that I couldn't believe. Sport has Pitt
rated seventh in "the country! Yes,
seventh in America! That's not the
end of it. In terms of talent, they say
Pitt has the second best talent in the
nation. A

The next question I had to ask
myself was quite simple: Why? How
can a team go from a sixth-place

finish in the Big East to a pre-season _

reason.

were rated seventh against stopping
the run, holding opponents to an im-
pressive 59 yards per game. Temple
churned out 129, which still“isn't im-
pressive when figuring that the Pan-
ther’s Craig Heyward compiled a
bruising 171 on his own. Temple
quarterback Lee Saltz only had 152
yards through the air. The key to the
Owl's victory was that they produced
the yardage when they needed it,
especially in the first quarter.
Temple jumped out to an early 3-0
lead on their second posession. Saltz,

ranking of seventh in the entire na-
tion? It simply doesn't make any
sense. When I told a member of the
Pitt sports department about this, he
told me that he had already seen the
tabloid. And what was his reaction?
He just laughed — and for good

  

The Panthers have some talented
players, but that's it. They don't have
any depth. Having nine scholarship
players just doesn't cut it. I do realize
Pitt's ranking was inflated because of
its new coach, Paul Evans, who did

 

flooding the._Pi.tt secondary with five
receivers, drilled a 39-yard strike to
receiver Keith Gloster to set up Bill

.Wright’s successful attempt. Not an

insurmountable lead. The Panther of-
fense again stalled, and again Saltz
drove his team down the field. Mix-
ing up his passes with runs by Paul
Palmer and Todd McNair, Temple

moved into position -for another"

Wright field goal. 6-0. The Owls had
over seven minutes more in poses-
sion time than Pitt in the first quarter.
Things could have been worse.

wonders at the Naval Academy and
has a good reputation.

. But what is most upsetting to me
about all this is that the last thing
Charles Smith and company need to
hear is how good they can be. They
don't need a pat on the back or some-

one to tell them that they are good.
And believe me, they could be
very good, possibly even a Top 10
team, if everything jells this year and
they can avoid injuries.
In my opinion, Smith, Curtis.Aiken,
Demetreus Gore and Jerome Lane

Paul Palmer is slip-slidin’ away from the Pitt defense in Saturday night's game. A torrential downpour turned Pitt
Stadium into a giant swimming pool during the third quarter, but the rain only spurred on the student sections.

In the second quarter, Paul Palmer
made sure they did. On- a crucial
third and three play at Pitt's 45, he
took a pitch-left from Saltz and blew
upfield to the 14, a gain of 31 yards.
Three plays later, Saltz teamed with

tight end Mike Hinnant for a_

touchdown. Arians decided on trying
-for a two-point conversion. It failed,
and the decision almost came back
to haunt Temple in the late moments
of the game. 12-0.

The Panthers aren't total strangers‘

to rather big deficits in this 1986

are a foursome that can't be matched
by more than 10 teams in America
in terms of natural individual ability.

But they don't need to hear those
things. They need to hear how bad
they were last season. Charles Smith
needs to be reminded that he didn't

improve in his sophomore campaign.
Demetreus Gore needs to be told that
ball possession is vital. His number
of turnovers last season, 95, was

atrocious. Jerome Lane needs to be _

told to play with more intensity,
while Curtis Aiken needs to be more

I also feel a certain amount of sym-

What is very clear from all of this". v?
is- that the expectation level of the Pitt I

other sports magazines. But Panther * 
fans will undoubtedly pick up onthis  
prediction, and other high rankings‘ 

 

that are sure to follow, putting an’ 
enormous amount of pressure on 

Evans. .
But hey, don't worry Panther fans. 1 I‘ ‘

Apparently the national media likes

Pitt's chances. And even if they do

fall flat on their faces, I wouldn't be 
surprised if the Panthers were a pre- »

There weren't many positive things
that came out of Pitt's 19-13 loss to

' A the Temple Owls. As Panther coach

‘ Mike Gottfried put it afterthe game,
”There’s nothing to be happy about.

A We lost and I didn't see anything

good that came from this game."

' ll_saw both good and bad. The
magnificent play of sophomore
tailback Craig ”Ironhead” Heyward
was a bright spot for the 2-2-1 Pan-
thers, but what has happened to
junior tailback Charles Gladman, an

-All-America candidate entering this
' season? - ‘

Gladman was benched by Gott-
fried after the Purdue game because
of his problems hanging on to the
football. In Pitt's first three games
Gladman dropped a few passes and
fumbled twice.

"Heyward, who started his second
straight game in front of Gladman,
rushed for a career high 171 yards on
26 carries and one touchdown.

He also caught two passes for 26
yards during Pitt's futile fourth quarter
drive when the Panthers drove from
their own 18-yard line to the Owls
12, only to see the clock run out
before quarterback john Congemi
could get off the snap on a fourth
down play.

Heyward was unavailable for com-
ment after the game, but even the
devastated Gottfried, who has en-
dured two tough losses and,a tie this
year, was very impressed with his.
tai|back’s play.

"Craig played great. He was about '

the only bright spot for us," said Gott-
fried. ”He played well the whole

Heyward the only bright spot in Pitt loss

And that wasn't the only time
Heyward was impressive. In the first
half when no rain fell at all,
”lronhead” carried the ball 10 times
for 83 yards. His best run of the night
set up Pitt-’s first touchdown in the
game.

Down 12-0 late in the second
quarter with the ball on Temple's 25-
yard line, Congemi pitched out to
Heyward, who broke a few tackles,
leaped over a defensive back and was
finally dragged down at the one-yard
line. There was no sense in fooling
around at this point. Everyone knew
what was coming next and Gottfried
didn't try to sneak one by anybody.
Congemi handed off to ”Ironhead”
for the touchdown, giving Pitt some
momentum going into the locker
room.

But on this night,, the Panthers
would need more than momentum.
While Gottfried and his staff were in-
side at halftime preparing for the sec-
ond half, the skies above Pitt Stadium
opened, and rain, along with high
winds, turned the field into a slip-
pery, hazardous area.

Passing the ball in this rain seemed
impossible, so both teams went to
their running games. Heyward
seemed to enjoy it as he scampered
for 88 second-half yards, including a
nifty 28-yard run off right tackle
which got Pitt out of bad field posi-
tion late invthe third quarter.

Despite the loss, Pitt fans had to en-

Pitt lost.

So what.

The most interesting performance
of the football game between Pitt and
Temple had nothing to do with the
football game between Pitt and Tem-
ple. Rather, it had everything to do
with those soggy people sitting in the
student section of Pitt Stadium.

JOE ZEFF

The student section has been
apathetic this season, sometimes
moreso than the team they come to
watch. Cheerleaders no longer en-
courage students to perform The
Wave; too often have the students
responded with The Trickle. They
cheer -whenever the Panthers score,
blame Mark Brasco whenever the
Panthers fail and drink mass quan-
tities of alcoholic beverages
whenever the opportunity presents
itself.

They spent the first two quarters of
the Temple game hurtling mustard
packets at each other. Until that point
it was their most valiant effort toward
distinguishing the Pitt student section
from others around the country. Sec-
tions 6, 7 and 8 had all the at-
mosphere of the Zelda’s Greenhouse
patio.

The antidote was finally discovered
during halftime.

Just add water. I

it rained-. And rained. And ‘rained.
Pitt coach Mike Gottfried said he had
never coached in such atrocious con-
ditions. Probably, Noah had never
navigated in such atrocious condi-
tions. But the student section did not
desert. The students stayed, spawn-
ing an uproarous wet T-shirt party at
Pitt Stadium. The students splashed
in ankle—high water. The cheerleaders
plopped into puddles. We're talking

underwater Panther pushups, fo|ks._

Uproarious behavior was the norm,
even though Pitt had fallen behind
against one of its lesser opponents.
Gottfried said afterward that
nothing good had come from this
game. He was wrong. The student
section has seldom been so suppor-
tive.’The students risked contracting
the common cold to root for the Pan-
thers. It was encouraging. It was in-
spirational. It was fun. Hopefully, the
student section will continue to be as
enthusiastic during the three home
games which remain this season.
Before the Temple game, Gottfried

authored a guest column in The Pitt-
"News in which he asked for student

support and stressed its importance.
He posted at least one victory Satur-
day evening, as the student section

.was more vivacious than ever.

Congratulations, students.

The Lady Panther volleyball team
has been very patient. On Sept. 5, Pitt
began the season with a second—place
finish at the Villanova Classic. A
month of second- and third-place
‘finishes passed. The Lady Panthers
came home last night with the
Georgetown Classic championship.

Pitt, playing without Denise
Frawley, won nine straight games.
The Lady Panthers defeated Maryland
15-9, 15-7 and 15-11 in the first
‘match of the tournament.

Pitt then dropped conference foe
Georgetown 15-10, 15-8 and 16-14.
The Hoyas, one of the stronger teams
in the Big East, were at full force
against the Lady Panthers. ”This was
a real important win versus George-
town,” said Pitt coach Shelton Col-

lier. ”We not only defeated them on’

their home court; we won in three
games.”

Howard University was Pitt's last
victim, falling to the Lady Panthers
15-11, 15-11 and 15-1.

Lisa Stewart led the Lady Panthers

in kills with 29, while senior Sue
Hoover chipped in with 22. Louise
O’Shaughnessey turned in three ex-
cellent matches. ”As a first-year set-
ter and floor leader, Louise has done
a great, job,” said Collier. ”She has
an excellent ’team—oriented’ attitude.
This is significant towards the team's
success.”

The Lady Panthers, 13-5 overall,
continued to play their high-caliber
style in the Classic. A style good
enough to win nine straight games for
Pitt. ”Most certainly, our goal going
into the tournament was to come out
with first place,” said Collier. ”We’ve
reached our short—term goal. Now,
we need to prepare and meet our.
long-term goals."

During practice this week, Collier
will be emphasizing Pitt's matches
next week with Kentucky and Penn
State, although he will not overlook
this weekend's Pitt Invitational at the
Fieldhouse. ”We are not overlooking
the Pitt lnvitational,”
”We are using our practices and the
invitational as tune-ups. The Wildcats
and Nittany Lions both will provide
stiff competition. i think we'll rise to
the challenge.”

This past weekend the Pitt men's
cross country team traveled to the the
Frostburg State Invitational held in
Maryland, where running conditions
were muddy and slippery.

The conditions would have been
perfect for a mud wrestling contest
but not for running over a cross coun-
try course of five miles.

Fifteen teams took part in the in-
vitational, with each team carrying
seven runners. ”The meet was very

competitive and the men's team ran

well,” said Pitt assistant coach Jim
Lear. '

Pitt finished fifth in the team stand-
ings, led by All-Americajoe Daniels.

Daniels finished sixth as the top run-

by another All—America, Tim Manes,
who finished 18th.

The other Pitt runners were Joe
Turner, Wilbur Bailey, Thomas Bog-
gan, John Herrock and John Hart-
man. All of these runners finished in
the top half of the field.

Daniels said he had intentions of
running well going into the meet. The
All—America rose to the occasion to
be a team leader. In past meets
Daniels has always run well and ap-
pears ready to make his mark on the
East in cross country competition.

Pitt's seven-runner squad consisted
of half-milers running cross country
for conditioning strength. Last year,

aided in their success. The team
probably would have scored higher
had Dave Moore made the trip, but
due to illnes he couldn’t run.

The Pitt cross country team has
proven to be a powerful squad. The
team has the ability to be among_the
elite at any meet. This upcoming
weekend, the team will be com-
peting at the Lehigh Invitational.

The meet will serve as preparation
before the Big East Championships

on Oct. 25. The Lehigh Invitational .
* will include some of the top competi-

tion on the East Coast.

”With the ability and talent of our
team, I think they will run well and
prove to be one of the better teams
on the East Coast,” said Lear.

He said Pitt will take its seven top
runners to the Lehigh meet.

same. Gottfried’s fancy for the pass-

ing game is one of the reasons Pitt's.

running attack has gained only a lit-
tle more than half the yardage that

Congemi’s aerial show has produc-_

ed so far this year.

Saturday night though, Pitt was

forced to run the ball, and they did
that quite well. Heyward’s perfor-
rnance may open new avenues for
Pitt's offense. A more diversified at-
tack could be the solution. Congemi
agrees. ”We can’t live and die by the
pass, but I think we did an effective
job running the football tonight,” said
Congemi. ”Craig hada super night.”

Bringing back the running attack
would possibly aid the Panther of-
fense. It would not only help

¢

Heyward, but Gladman as well.
Gladman carried the ball only four
times for 13 yards and didn't exactly
help eradicate his status on the bench
by fumbling early in the third quarter.

Two plays later, Temple scored what

proved to be the
touchdown. V

But Gladman is no doubt a great
running back, as is Heyward. A
backfield of those two would be a

devastating combination. I'm not sug-

winning

_gesting that senior fullback Tommy

Brown should be demoted. He is a
hard-nosed kid who brought the Pan-
thers back into ‘the game with a
29-yard touchdown run in the third
quarter. Also, Brown has been Pitt's
offensive player-of-the-game twice
this season.

But Gottfried should give Gladman
a chance in the backfield with
Heyward. We're talking about two
very good pro prospects here. I don't
mind Pitt passing the ball 30-40 times
a game, but I'd like to see Heyward
and Gladman get 30 carries between
them a game.

I'm aware that that is exactly the
number of rushing attempts they had
against Temple, but Gladman needs
more action.

If Gottfried "doesn't try the two
together in weeks to come, there can
hardly be any question that Gladman
is in the coach's doghouse. And that
isn't a good sign for Pitt's running at-

tack, which I believe is vital to any‘

success the Panthers hope to enjoy
in their last six games.

20. Congemi opened by firing a
perfect strike to Chuck Scales for 13.
After tailback Charles Gladman lost
seven on a pitch, the quarterback
drilled two completions to Tom
Brown, setting up an extremely
crucial fourth down play, two yards
needed for the first. Shrewdly, on the
quick count, Congemi dived over
center, easily picking up the yardage
needed to continue the drive. A 16-
yard spiral to recently converted
receiver Keith Tinsley brought the
Panthers to the Temple 40.

Five small-yardage plays later,
Pitt's ”monster car-crasher” tailback
Heyward took a pitch-off tothe right,
bulled upfield, hurdled tacklers
around the 10, then carried Owls on
his back till they dragged him down
at the -1. After such a magnificent run,
the least the Panthercoaches could
do was let Heyward polish it with six
points. So, he was again handed the
ball, like the 40,000 plusonhand
predicted. Touchdown. Temple, 12-7
at the half. _

Then Mother Nature turned on the
sprinkler system, converting-the Pitt
Stadium turf into a water slide. The
monsoon, though, was not the cause
of Charles G|adman’s fumble on
Pitt's first possession of the second
half. Cutting through the middle with
breadloaf in hand, the sopping ball
was easily stripped, then recovered
by Owl defensive back Larry
Brewton. Two consecutive Palmer
carries had Temple in the end zone
for the second time, giving the
visitors a 19-7 lead.

Pitt scored only once in the second

 

half. After a poor punt by-Temple

midway through the third quarter,
fullback Brown took a handoff and
rain-danced his way into the endzone_

to cut the lead to six. The aquatic .
conditions again played havoc on the.

game.

The Panthers had two shots to win
the contest late in the fourth quarter.
With 3:45 remaining, a botched snap
from center was the anti—climatic end-
ing to a fourth down play at»Temp|e’s
28. The defense bravely held, giving
Pitt posession at their own 18. Con-
gemi again caught fire, hitting five
straight passes, moving his team
downfield to Temple's 40, then a
pass interference call on fourth down
placed the ball on the 12.

‘By this time, the clock was being
kept on the field. ’’I couldn't get any
cooperation from the referees at'all
down there near the end. We were
trying to yell and ask how much time

_ was left, but they wouldn't answer,”
said Congemi. Two incompletions ‘
and a sack, then it was all over for

Pitt.

”Now,” Congemi quietly stated in V

the locker room, ”we have to make
up for a game we should have won
with our eyes closed.” Traveling to

Notre Dame next weekend, Pitt had ' ‘I

better have its eyes wide open.

The scoreboard-clock mystery is solved

 

. These are only some of the things

‘A that went through my mind as I-

waited for my shoes to dry on Sun-
day morning:

0 It's 9 a.m., and my shoes are a
dark gray. They were light brown

' before I walked into that lake, other-
' wise known as Pitt Stadium. l read

two different Sunday papers as I
waited for my shoes to turn brown

again, and both dealt largely with "the

clock situation at Pitt Stadium in the
waning moments of the game.

Time, which was being kept by the
officiating crew, expired as Pitt lined
up to get one last play off. One paper
said it was a clock malfunction, while
the other said the game-clock went
out. Both were mistaken.

Late" in the game, I was standing on
the sideline at the 30-yard line on

Temple's side of the field. I noticed
a man in front of me wearing zebra
stripes, holding a switch in his hand.

. It was the game clock operator. He
shall remain nameless.

With 2:18 showing on the clock,
time was called, while referee Tom
Thamert and umpire Dave Hicks,ap-
proached the timekeeper. They ex-
pressed — rather vividly — dis-
pleasure with his work. Temple
coach Bruce Arians also approached
the group, but he was ushered away.

Finally, Thamert told the
timekeeper to ”forget it. We have the
time from here on in.”

With that, the timekeeper put his
switch down. His job for the day was
completed; 2:18 showed on the
clock for a couple of plays, then it
was erased. .

 

John Congemi ‘was guessing at how
much time was left on the clock from
there on in.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 6, T986

Don't blame the timekeeper. If he
made an honest mistake, there is
nothing you can do about it.

What about the officials? If the time
on the clock (2:18) was wrong, why
not correct it and continue running
the clock on the scoreboard?

It could have made a major dif-
ference if that clock was on. I bet
John Congemi could have taken that
last snap before time had expired.

0 Getting back to the rain, the stu-
dent section was nuts when the man-
soon began. When the rain finally
slowed down to a torrential
downpour, it seemed like there were
more students there than before.

Pitt should get the fire department
to hose down the student section dur-
ing all home games. Perhaps if the
school did that, the student section

would be as good as it was Saturday
night. V

0 Pitt drew 40,000-plus fans to a
game that began 90 minutes after a
hard downpour. The weather forecast
was also calling for a 60-percent

chance. of showers, and they were

playing Temple.

I think it is safe to say that night
football works at Pitt.

0 The next step is for Pitt to install
permanent lighting at the stadium. If
they are going to keep renting
MUSCO lights, Pitt might as well just
have Servico flashlight night at Pitt
Stadium. It can give out free
flashlights and have all the fans aim
those babies at the field. There would
probably be less glare and more light.

They might even attract more fans.
I know I could use a free flashlight,
couldn't you?

0 Mike Gottfried said in camp he
was not happy with Craig Heyward’s
physical condition. Well, he has got
to be happy now.

Heyward is still rather large, but he
showed little or no sign of fatigue as
he carried the offensive attack (1 71'
yards on 26 carries) for Pitt on Satur-
day night. '

0 On the other hand, there is
Charles Gladman, a 1,000-yard
rusher last year. He carried theball
four times for Pitt on Saturday night.

Gladman was originally removed
from the starting lineup, in part for
not holding on to the ball. He finally
gets a nice hole on his fourth carry
against Temple, and he takes a hard
second hit and fumbles.
