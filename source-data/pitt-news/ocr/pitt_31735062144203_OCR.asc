Student Congress Begins
Book Drive Tomorrow

In an attempt to partially solve
the textbook s*horta.ge, Student
Congress will launch its book
drive tomorrow. .

Because of paper and labor
shortages, book publishers were
unable to ﬁll completely the order
placed by the University. As a re-
sult, many ‘Pitt students are faced

with the prospect of taking
c(;u‘ses without textbooks. In

some courses as few as one-third
of the students have books. There
is little hope of receiving some
necessaly textbooks until. as late
as the and 01' 1\/'lr.1'ch.

Faced with this situation, Stu-
dent Congiiess f rmed a plan which
would provide a library of text-
l)(r-ol;.3 in the University. The plan
calls on Pitt stud-en.ts wlio have
no use for the scarce t.e:<tbool<s
to lend them to Student Congress,
which in turn will establish a
textbook library in the Reserve
bookroom. A shield with the own-
er’s name will be attached to each
lzook. The owner also will receive
a receipt for-his book from the
Student »Congre.~.s library commit-
tee.

Boo}-:s will be c-oller,-ted. by the
members oi‘ the conmuittee every
day in the ground ﬂoor booth 05;’

Pitt Prepares

F or Conference

in Harrisburg 
l

The ﬁrst’ meeting of the Pitt:
del;eg«ation to the Intercollegiate
Con-feren-ce on Government was
held on Tuesday, February 19.
Details for the conference were
submitted to the delegates by the
chairman, Martin Rothman.

The ICG is an organization oi
Pennsylvania colleges and univer-
sities, devoted to providing for
students of government a prac-
tical insight into the workings of
,.€government. The ICG was organ-
ized in 1934 and met annually
until 1942, when war-time travel
conditions made such meetings
impossible. Previous meetings
liave taken the form of state

iegiislatures, pol.itical conventions
or peace conferences.

This year the convention will
take the form of a model Con-
gress and be attended by repre-
sentatives from over 45 Pennsyl-
vania schools. The ‘Convention
will meet in Harrisburg from
March 29 to 31.

Expenses for transportation and
accommodations will be shared
by Pitt, which has appropriated
$175, and the delegates them-
selves.

Nutting Joins
Law Faculty

Another new campus personal-

'or of law. He was an associate so-
i-citor of the ‘Department of. Agri-
culture and the War Food admin-
‘stration in Washington from May
‘.942 until January 1946.

He was in charge of legal work
11 connection with administering‘
regulatory laws within the juris-
iiction of the de-partmeht. The
'aws concerned enforcement of or-
1-ers regarding distribution of
Iood. The department handled a
live million dollar food. purcliase
daily for lend lease and dctern1in-
ed the quotas on the amount of
milk, beef, and other commodi-
ties to -civilians during the war.

At the State University of Iowa,
Mr. Nutting received his bachelor
 arts degree in 1927 and doctor
of laws in 1930. Two other degrees
include a master of laws~from
Harvard in 1932, and doctor of
juridical science in 1933. He
taught at the Universities of Ne-
draska and Texas until 1942, when
he resigned his faculty position to
enter the Department of Agricul-

ture.

On The Town-
It’s Colossal
It’s Stupendous

It has color! Comedy! Fresh-
ness! Originality! What does? “On
The Town,” of course. So says
Ward Morehouse, of the New
York Mirror.

Other well-known critics are
equally enthusiastic. Lewis Nich-
ols of the N ew York Times, wrote,
“The -freshest and most engaging
musical show to come -this way
since the golden day of ‘Okla-
homa.’ Everything about it is
ri-gh .” New York News reviewer

Coeds To Usher
On Monday Night

Coeds attired in evening gowns
will add a note of formality to
ushering and candy-selling at the
Pitt beneﬁt performance of “On
the Town” at the Nixon, Monday,
March 4.

According to Betsy Briant,
chairman of the ushering com-
mittee, 56 women selected from
all classesof the University on
the basis of leadership in activi-
ties and scholastic" " standing as
typifying the ideal Pitt woman.
will serve as ushers. They will
wear pastel evening gowns to
distinguish them from the candy-
sellers who will be dressed in
white formals.

Quarter-pound boxes of Mc-
Donald’s chocolates will be sold
during intermission, the proceeds
of which will go to the beneﬁt.
Candy chairman Melrose Fleming
reports the women are fashion-
ing gold and blue trays for bear-
ing the sweets to prospective cus-
tomers.

A partial list of candy sales-
men is: Adrienne Aldisert, Lor-

‘ etta Rosenbloom, Mary Lou Gest-

ner, Shirley Wilkins. Jean Muel-
ler, Mary Ellen Lambing, Sarah
Demase, Penn Burke, Sammy
Round, Judy Malone, Betty Sea-
ton, and ‘Miriam Drumm.

 

Nancy Walker

John Chapman contributes his
share of approving adjectives. “A
WOW it is bright, fresh,
funny, witty. The lyrics are ex-
cellent and intelligent and the
score is cleverly imagined.”

Little Red Riding Hood thought
she had troubles with one wolf.
“Miss Subway” of “On The Town”
finds herself followed by three
wolves . . sailors, that is. The
plot of the musical hit centers
around the sailors and their search
for “Miss Subway,” played by
Miss Nancy Walker, during a
week-end leave in New York.

“I recommend it with no reser-
vations at all’. I had a wonderful
evening.” That was the comment
of Wolcott Gibbs, the New Yorker
critic. The evening of March 4
will be a wonderful one for you
if you attend, so buy your ticket
now!

Ticket sales will end at 5 p. m.
today, Wednesday. After Wed-
nesday, however, they can be
bought at the Nixon ticket office.
Remember, there are no BAD
seats at a musical s-how. Even
“peanut heaven” buyers will be
able to see and hear well. And
EVERY seat must be sold if the
University is to make a proﬁt.

The latest rep-ort from the ad-
vertising solicitors shows that
$3400 worth of advertising has
been sold, and approximately
$1400 has been contributed to the
twelfth ﬂoor benefit by patrons.

A THE PITT NEWS

W7o:mei1 Play
Vital l.’ai.'t In
Cariipus Alf airs

Fifty years ago two women
started Pitt little knowing that in
1946 approximatel_v 700!) women
would be active members of the
Pitt (.‘?.il’lpLlS.

Toﬂav women are not only in
the “icollveg-3. but also in bustineszr
ar.lmEni.-‘tration, nursing;. engineer-
ing, denti=.try, medicine. law. rc-
tail trainine, and p'narma«.ry. Wam-
en have undertaken t3 learn of
every occupation and profession.

They have created their own

organizations and traditions. A
high school relations committee
contacts high school girls intro-

ducing them to the university in
their city. Senior mentors, cus-
toms committee, guild programs,
interclass sing, a University hand-
book——the Vade Mecum—a Wom-
en‘s health service. and a recep-
tion; sponsored by fraternity wom-
en are among the plans made by

women for new women entering‘

the University. The ceremony of,
Lantern Night handed down from
year to year is a tradition which
ﬁrst makes the freshman women
a real part of the student life.

The Women’s Self Governing
association with its many com-
mittees and programs give the
women a campus life apart from
the men. They serve as Univer-
sity hostesses in the Nationality
rooms, at Commons Room teas,
and on their own twelfth floor.
The tradition of Coronation is a
ceremony for every -gradu-ating
class.

'I_‘here are many activities spon-
sored jointly by men and wom-
en. Women are a part of campus
publications, the Owl and the
Pitt News; they belong to Pitt
Players, Student Congress, dance
committees, choirs, religious
clubs; they work together on
money raising campaigns,‘ em-
ployment committees, Spring Fes-
tival, Scholars day, and the Chan-
cellor’s reception for parents.

Besides attending classes as did
the first women students at Pitt,
the women today are a part of
at least 50 different organizations.
They are a part of every plan and
program at Pitt.

Regulai:io11 Issued
Concerning Leaves

Under recent War department
regulations Arm.y or Navy offic-
ers on terminal leave may now
receive educational ‘beneﬁts un-
der the GI Bill of Rights. Prior to
January 1, 1946, an oﬁi-cer on

terminal leave had to pay his own
tuition charges. Under the new
ruling, an officer is eligible for
government paid‘ tuition, supplies,
and books. However, no subsi_ --
ence will be paid until his
terminal leave is over.

Many ofﬁcers avoid return-
ing to school because they are
either unwilling to pay their own
way or fear that their Army pay
may be withheld from them.

Making their first appearance
in the basketball tournament, the
senior women easily defeated an
outclassed junior quintet last
Wednesday, 21-10. The upperclass
team took over at the opening
whistle and glided to an easy vic-
tory, sparked by the sharp shoot-
ing of Ruth Czapiewski, who scor-
ed 12 points for her team. Clara
Papuga -was high scorer for the
losers, racking up six tallies.

The sophomores turned the
tables on the seniors «Monday,
however, chalking up a 10-13 win
in a spirited battle. The game was
marked by a high degree of de-
termination on «both -sides, but t-he
sophs proved more accurate in
their shooting. Charlotte Weil led
the winners with ten points while
Ruth Czapiewski gained for the
losers. The next -game on the
schedule has the sophomores tan-
g-ling with the (freshmen today at
12:30 in the Cathedral gym.

Bowling started on its way last
Thursday with a general practice
session for all wo-men interested.
Five teams of ﬁve each were
formed: the ‘Starlets, the Alley
Cats, Meade’s Open, the Tenpin
Terrors, and the Gizmo Five. Any
women who are -still interested
are asked to be present at the
University Alleys this Thursday
at 12 and more ‘teams will be
formed.

The competition will get under
way this week. Spirit is keen and
many promising bowlers have
signed up to play, according to
Mary Balinski, bowling manager.

The downstairs alleys have all
been reserved from 12 to 2
and people who have 1:30 classes
are assured of getting back to
the University on time and with-
out rushing.

$niﬁcant to note is the fact that

team 2 is composed entirely of
first year freshmen.

The highest individual score,
189, was made by T-homas Pug-
lisi of the School of Engineering.
Pitt’s team placed ahead of such
expert opponents as University of
l\/Iaryland, L e h 1 g 11 university,
Western ‘Maryland College, Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, and Car-
negie Tech.

The team that won 31 out of
33 matches is composed of Ben-
kart, Kish, Teles, Krantz, Har-
grave, Ahwesh, Speilman, Pug-
lisi, Short, and Gigliotti. These
men «ﬁred -the highest score ever
made at Pitt with a total of 1867
out of 2000. They were topped
last week only by Michigan State’s
1893. In the individual matches
Pitt again display-ed its winning
form by defeating Ohio State,
Maryland, Ohio U., Syracuse,
V. P. 1., Montana State, Nevada,
Idaho, Tuskegee, and Michigan
university.

Pitt ROTC will meet stiff oppo-
sition this week when they ﬁre
against Niagara U., Xavier U.,
Georgia Tech, Texas A and M.,
N. Dakota, N. Carolina State,
Iowa U., New Mexico. and N .Y.U.

The varsity team lags not far
from the ROTC team for win-
ning top honors. Tlhey garnered
the highest score in Pitt’s riﬂe
history when they tallied 1406
out of 15-0-0 shots losing only to
formidable Michigan State. This
week they will attempt to repeat
this performance when they
tackle Georgia Tech, Oklahoma
A. and M., Clarkson Coll, New
Mexico A. and M., and N.Y.U.
The team is sparked~by the ex-
cellent work of Reidl, Herlinger,
Gordon, Benkart, Kish, Carter,
Hodil, Speilman, P-uglisi, Koontz,
Ahwesh, and Calder.

THE PITT NEWS

Sports Editor

 

Who will be the next Pitt coach? By next week this question
should be answered. Mr. Hagan has been interviewing, and studying
the qualiﬁcations of the many applicants but let’s hope the new coach
doesn’t meet the same stone wall that met Clark Shaughnessy.

In an International News Service interview Clark Shaughnessy
was asked why he had left the University of Pittsburgh. Shaughnessy
replied: “It was the alumni. If they don’t win every game they
holler. The university is okay but the alumni have been divided
for years and I was caught in the middle.” .

Shag has something there. Everyone wants winning football. but
no onedoes a thing about it. The present “simon pure” policy which
the univers~ity has been following for the past seven years stops Pitt
from competing with other colleges in getting top football material.-
Our present football. crop has tuition and books provided and a job to
earn some spending money and that’s all the farther the university
goes. '
 .Whcre the university steps is where the alumni should begin. .If
they want winning football, then l.ct the members who can do so,
take a player under their wing and give him a little gift at the end of
each month. The Big Ten Code doesn’t consider this an illegal prac-
tice. ‘ . c

If the Pitt Alumni want that winning ball club this year, the
time to start doing something is now. Trouble is now brewing
amongst the enrolled gridders. As things stand at least a half of
dozen first string gridders intend pulling out at the end of the semes-
ter. In fact one did so already and as talk goes he is headed for
Purdue. Others have been getting offers from Southern schools, Big
Ten universities, the Ivy League, and from colleges out west. Many
of the,l1i’gher-ups are taking all of this talk lightly. for they say it's
the same talk every year. This might. be the year the talk material-
izcs.

At the, present time the only candidate for the coaching post who
actually knows and realizes the situation is Doc Ilartwig. Doc more
or less grew up with these problems the past few years and if anyone
is capable of combating it, it is this former Pitt All American.

Pitt Panther Reconversion _

What‘ Panther athletics as well as Pitt intramurals and physical
education program needs most is a Field House in a convenient loca-
tion. ;

Pitt sports,are on the upswing. Track was resumed this past fall,
tennis and gzolf will be resumed this spring if sufficient interest is
shown, and swimming, boxing and wrestling has a more than better
chance to start if we get a satisfactory place to carry on.

Where can a Field House be built which can be considered a con-
venient locadion? Our suggestion is the vacant lot on the Fifth Ave-
nue side of the university across from the Masonic Temple. The City

-of Pittsburgh has possession of the lot due to a couple 100,000 dollars

back taxes. If a compromise could be reached with the City by pay-
ing so much for the lot and over a span of years give tbema dozen
dates to hold events in the Field House, maybe it could be obtained.

Let’s hear your suggestions.

Panthers Finish Cage Season
At Morgantown Saturday Nite

West Virginia’s Mountaineers——wl1o go boxing one better with their one-two—threc scoring punch

The Panthers, with an unimpressive 7-6 record for the year, could assuage the brunt of a three-game

In the other crucial game of

battle. Dick Smith led the way
for the Phi Delts While Irv Scha"f-

Real Revelation

Of A Situation

By Teddy Termite
Do you have that fenced-in
feeling lately? Do you feel that
the elevators are crowded or do
you prefer your trouser creases on
the sides? Do you have trouble

breathing in the hallways? If you .

do—then, congratulations broth»
er, you’re normal.

In other words to state it a bit
more -colloquially——“Dis joint is
crowded!” Or to bring the point
home to both of our more schol-
any reads-rs—-—“The recent inﬂux
of World War II veterans has re-
sulted in an overcrowding of con-
temporary facilities for higher ed-
ucation.”

However, as usual, Pittites are
taking the situation in stride an.d
trying to look on the -brighter side
of things. After all, we do have
the new Tuck shop addition with
its luxuriant wooden furnishings
and appurtenances which some
wag-a philosopher, no dou-bt-
has dtubhed the Gloom ro-om. Of
course, he was only jesting sljnce
what could be more relaxing than
wooden benches-especially. after
having to put up with those hor-
rid old overstuffed seats all
through the war! Then, too, men
are in abundance now and, bear
traps and lassos are fast becom-
ing 3 drug on the market.

The sudden preponderance of
men seems to have caught some
coeds off guard, such as one Tuck
shop iwolfes-s who recently re-
m.arl:ed, “Gosh, there’re so many
of them—I just don’t know where
to start.” So there she stood,
ainoozed an-d confoozed, but def-
initely interested. We asked Chris
l\/[anion what she thought about
the return of the male element
and garnered the following,
“'What; can I say? I don’t want to
be quoted, I don’t want my name
in print, I’m just happy—that’s
all!" That’s enough, Chris old gal,
that’s enough! <

Stag parties anc (1 lot of hard
work in cleaning frat houses was
the order the day the last
‘weal:-end due to women’s rushing.
(The men had some time to them-
selves.) At the Phi Delt house
there was a bee-hive of activity
as they welcomed back Jack Bam-
bury and Leo Kelleher. Acldin(2,‘ to
their st.re,ngt.h they iniii:1ted,,Bob
l\‘='i>;on and pledged Bill Hagelin.
On Wallingford Street at the Phi
Geam house a big‘ alumni smokes:
was much in evidence. Down the
street at the Delt ‘house another
stag party was in progress. Today
the Belts put on their best bib and
tucker as they entertain the
Thetas at a tea dance. When we
saw the Sigs troop into the Web-
ster hall with dates we discov-
ered a dance held in honor of re-
turned Sigs from the service. Fol-
lowing 3 Phi Ep up to the Pilot
House we found great prepara-
tions being made for the Phi Ep
elate affair this Saturday. On
North Bellefield we found the
SAE’s spi*-ucing up their lions’
lair for the AID-Pi desert dance to
take place there I5‘;-icl.'ay night.
Next door he Phi Kaps were

The chorus line of bedecked gals
in old-fashioned nineties was,
shall we say, interesting.

Chi Omega will hold a dance at

Speaking of dances the Thetas will
trip the light fantastic on Saturday
