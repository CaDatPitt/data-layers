akland water main breaks

Tuesday’s 9o—degree temperatures

_. even made the ground sweat. .

At least, that was the scene on
one Central Oakland street after a
12-inch water main burst around-1
p.m., scattering chunks of cement
and crushed asphalt across the road.
Police responded quickly to the
gushing break, closing a two-block
‘stretch of South Bouquet Street be-
tween Bates andjoncaire streets.

OPINIOES

It is unclear exactly how many
residents lost water service because
of the break, which opened a 2—foot
hole in the ground‘ and turned the
road into a murky stream, but resi-

dents along South Bouquet Street V

reported losing water shortly after
1 p.m. ‘ -

One Pittsburgh Water and Sewer
Authority worker said the sweltering
summer temperature likely played a
hand in the break. "He and his crew
were investigating the cause and said
full water service would be repaired

by Tuesday night.

,“These things are always temper-
ature, in both the summerand the
Winter,” said a worker. “When you
get ﬂuctuating water temperatures
coming in, that puts stress on the
lines. Add that to the ground shifting
with the temperature and you can
get a break.”

He said a 12-inch line is “big, but V
not the biggest kind of line.”
Whatever the line’s size, it caused

water and asphalt for at least 20

minutes andreached a height of 3
to 4 feet, according to eyewitnesses.
Water ran swiftly down South Bou-
quet, then banked sharply right to
descendjoncaire.

“We watched it break up the
ground,” said Oakland resident and
Pitt student Mattie Moran, who lives
in the apartment building standing
beside the ruined street. He de-

' scribed the blacktop carnage from

the shade beside the road.

Assistant News Editor

Christine Hrbek didn’t shy away
from challenges in athletics or aca-
demics. ‘ .

Her family, friends, teachers and
coaches often noted her determined
attitude and workethic, which stood
out in the classroom, on the ﬁeld and
on the court. V A r — V

“She could be the tough guy on
the sidelines or the compassionate
kid who worked at the Special Olym-
pics,” her father, Michael Hrbek,

' said.

Hrbek, who was entering her
senior year at Pitt, died June“ 24 in
Kunkletown, Pa.

State police in nearby Lehigh—
ton, Pa., are still investigating, and
a cause of death has not been de-
termined.‘ 1

‘‘It’s been 'a tough time for us,”
her father said. “Her kindness was
just unbelievable, and that is what
I think people will miss the most
about her.” '

Most details about her death
have not yet been made public, and
the cause of death may not be re-
leased for several months, according
to police. - ‘

Hrbek was born in Hackensack,
N.J., and lived in Effort, Pa. She

graduated from Pleasant Valley

High School in Broadheadsville, Pa.
in 2007. Hrbek attended the Col-

“I was about to go on my daily Rite Aid trip,
but the road was a river,” said the shirtless
Kaisely, his long red hair hanging damp inthe
sweltering summer afternoon.

The water crew started reconstruction
work by 3 p.m., a process which involves dig-
ging up the road, cutting out the length of
broken pipe and replacing it with a pre-cut
copy. In ideal conditions, such aﬁx should take
no more than eight hours, workers said, but
there’s no way to know until its done.

“You never know what can happen once
you start digging and replacing lines, but we’ve
got our crew together, and we’re already mov-
ing,” one crew member said. “This kind"'ofstuﬂ'

During the repair process, workers used
a backhoe and high~powered cement saw to
break up the damaged stretch of concrete, and
with some deft shovel maneuvers they were
able to dig an approximately 1o-foot-by-10-
foot hole, exposing the damaged water line so
it could be repaired.

' One Oakland resident, walking by the re-
cently stopped break, said he is worried this
break could prove as difliculttoﬁxasthe ongo-

A funeral service was held at 10 a.m. Tues-

Hrbek is survived by her parents, Michael

Amanda and Samantha. .

Christine was buried at the George Wash-
ington Memorial ParkinParamus, N.]., abush-
lined cemetery ﬂanked by apark and a country
club in northern Newjersey.

In the time since her death, the community

I sprang up to support Hrbek’s family. More than

100 people have commented on legacy.com,
an Internet memorial site, expressing their
condolences at the family’s loss and sharing
their memories of Hrbek.

Those comments varied widely. Some were
written by family friends and high school class-
mates. Others were college ﬁiends and Hrbek’s
teachers at Pitt. ,

‘Hrbek said that the outreach from what
he called Christine’s “Pittsburgh family” sur-
prised them, with students making the trek

across the state forthe viewing and service to *

offer condolences to a-family they had never
met before. —

Lauren Keating, a Pitt—Greensburg student
who played basketball with Christine since
ﬁfth grade, said that she would miss herfriend‘
very much. _ '

“She was a great person,” Keating said.
“She lived life to the fullest.” _

Christine Hrbek, herfather said, grew close
with the girls she playedsports with when she
was younger. I

of a beauty queen and the courage of, well, yes,

night,” her former coach,]im Taylor, said. “She
loved the competition.” _
She took to the court with a passion, Taylor

” said, and “didn’t bat an eye” at the opposition,

no matter whom she faced.

During her senior year,‘ Hrbek played as
a point guard. Although she was a bit taller
than the position usually demanded, Taylor
said that herjntelligence and determination
allowed her to succeed. '

Taylor — who had known and coached
Hrbek from junior high — said that her com-
petitive nature and determination made her
an asset to the team.

“No matter what, she played hard,” Taylor
said. “She was good to have on your team and
not against you.” 5

Scott Caffreygcoached Hrbekfor three years
on the high school’s softball team, the Bears.
He described her as a “tough-nosed kid,” who
did whatever she set "herself to do.

That determination brought her the defen-
sive player of the year award while playing at
third base her senior year at Pleasant Valley.
She committed very few errors, said Caffrey.

While she wasn’t the best hitter in the

In basketball, Hrbek “played tough every

world, Caffrey said that Hrbek brought the
same attitude to the plate, and —— whether it
was hunting or just getting on base — she did
whatever was asked of her.

“She could give you an impression that she
was a tough kid,” Caffrey said, “but she was
really caring.” -

Caffrey remembered that his daughter, 5
at the time, looked forward to watching the
games when Hrbek played.

After the games, Hrbek would carry Caf-
frey’s daughter around on her shoulders.

Christine Hrbek, Caffrey said, valued her
family very much and would often go to watch
her brother Daniel’s baseball games. V

Michael Hrbek said that the two siblings
were close, and Christine Hrbek would help
her brother with anything.

“Christine could be doing anything, and.

whatever it was, she would drop everything
and support him,” he said. ,1

Michael Hrbek said Daniel Hrbek spoke
at the service for his sister, saying that he was
inspired by her and hoped that he could be like
her in the future. A

Now, Michael Hrbek said, they hope that
their familywill come closer as they heal from
a tragedy that has been “really tough to swal-
low” for all ofthem.

“Sometimes you’ve just got to hug your
loved ones a little bit closer,” he said. ‘ »

Don't rent, or
don’t smoke  

y e all have reasons to hate
our neighbors, whether
it is for their obnoxious

Chihuahua or the fact that they
constantly call the cops on your
raging parties.

But what if your neighbor’s
habits were actually endangering
your health?

An essay published in The New
England Journal of Medicine ar-
gues for a ban against smoking
in all public housing complexes,

stating that one person smoking’ '

in the building exposes others to
seeondhand smoke, toxie gases and

ickoff, one of the fi%per’s authors.
The essay also notes the toxic
chemical residue of cigarettes that
gets absorbed by things like carpet-
ing and clothing even after smoke
has cleared."

If these risks are legitimate, the ’

ban should also apply to all apart-
ment buildings.

Many landlords already have
policies against smoking, just like
many have policies against keeping
pets. Well, except smoking is bad
for everyone and not just for those
with allergies. -’

Although we would support
a smoking ban in public housing
complexes as well as all apart-
ment buildings to move toward
a healthier society, it might only
be practical to leave the smoking
policy up to the building owner’s
discretion.

If you’re worried about your
neighbors smoking habits seep-
ing through the paper-thin wall you
share, seek out a building with‘ a

_ non-smoking policy. And if you

don’t want to strain your damaged

lungs by moving your smoking out— '

doors, seek out a smoking friendly
building, don’t rent or, well, don’t
smoke.

ranking. Some contest a weighted

ers say the class’s diﬁiculty provides
merit. Yet with multiple Valedictori-

over such ﬁne points.

We hadn’t gone to a comic conven-
tion since 2006, but before that we
went to them all the time. It’s not
that we likedspandex soap operas or
anything, because that would have
meant we were really nerdy and pa-
thetic. No, we wentbecause we were
part of the hipster indieground —»
whatever that means — and we were
obligated to cover such things.

That’s right, we covered them
all as serious working members of v

the alternative press, including the
hugelyipopular Comic—Con in San
Diego. I '

I Charlotte’s Heroes Convention
is one of the largest and longest-
running independent comic con-

ventions in America. HeroesCon

prides itself on bringing together

a bunch of mainstream and avant-j

garde comics creators without a lot

ated with massive productions like

_ sion panels were hosted by industry

insidersand, with the exception of
“3o Rock’s” Scott Adsit, the show
could boast of few celebrities from

Instead, HeroesCon focused on
comics -— and in that respect was
quite satisfying. Among other no-
tables, Pittsburgh-based artist Jim

’ Rugg was on hand to promote Af-

rodisiac, a blaxploitation-inspired
work that pays careful homage to a
variety of his creative inﬂuences.

Given the high quality of the »

rial on display, we wasted little time

tinuity has always been intricate,
and only people without interest-
ing lives could possibly follow the

comic convention

recent exploits of their favorite DC
and Marvel characters.
Featured guest Rob Liefeld —

creator of such titles as “X-Force,” I

Liefeld several times in the hotel ﬁt-

workouts and he did some routine
that involved quarter-motion move-

On Afghanistan, hard to believe Stee|e’sright

Molly Oreen
Columnist

 

Republican National Committee
chairman Michael Steele’s efforts to
win the respect ofhis party are about
as ﬁuitless as his attempts to bring “off
the hook” back into popular usage.
His reign as chairman has been salted
with embarrassing gaffes, a contro-
versial surprise — and not in a good
way — book release and several very

public feuds with certain members of -

Republican leadership.
Most recently, Steele was caught

on tape blasting the war in Afghani-

stan, which might not have been such
a good idea, since —— newsﬂash! —— the

Republican Party, as in the political
party he represents, has been con-
sistently supportive of the war since
the United States entered it almost
nine years_ago. Now, Steele is taking
more heat than John Boehner’s tan-
ning bed, from Democrats and Re-
publicans alike.

Steelewas speakingataConnecti—
cut ﬁtndraiser when he commented

that Afghanistan “was awarof[Presi—
dent Barack] Obarna’s choosing,” ac-
cordingto MSNBC. He then suggested
that the war was not even winnable.

“If[Obama’s] suchastudent ofhis-
tory, has he not understood that, you
know, that’s the one thing you don’t
do is engage in a land war in Afghani-
stan,” Steele said. “Because everyone
who’s tried, over a thousand years of
history,—has failed.”

Predictably, within hours of its re-
lease on You'Iube, Republicans such
asjohn McCain,]im DeMint and Tom
Cole began the savage mangling of
Steele. They ripped on his credibility
and some called for his resignation.
They all left him for dead — like a
herd. of antelope abandoning its

 weakest member to be picked off by
1}'.polit:ical talk shows, Democrats or

Liz Cheney, if she could only get her
hands on him.

Steele’s words were described as
“embarrassing,” “inaccurate” and
“an affront, both to the honor of the
Republican party and to the com-
mitment of the soldiers ﬁghting,” —

that last one coming from the loving

desk of Bill Kristol. Kristol’s letter
urging Steele to resign — which was
addressed,“Dear Michael,” no less
— reeked with passive-aggressive
restraint. ' .

The Democratic National Comn1it—
tee, never missing an opportunity to
damage the ﬁne, upstanding reputa-

_ tion of the Republican Party even at

its own expense, had this hypocriti-
cal tidbit to say hi an official press re-
lease, according to the Washington
Post: “... The American people will
be interested to hear that the leader
of the Republican Partythinks recent
events related to the war are ‘comi-
cal’ and that he is betting against our
troops and rooting for failure in Af-
ghanistan.”

The problem with this attack on
Steele is that, well, -since when is the
DNC the political party that implies

- others are unpatriotic or “against” the

troops just for being philosophically
opposed to a war?

In fact, the saddest part about
Steele’s political beating is that his
comments actually had some merit.
Without a doubt, the content was far

from accurate. Implying that Obama, .

initiated the war in Afghanistan and
then denying any Republican respon-

sibility for it is beyond laughable, be-"

yond hypocritical, though, frankly,
not beyond Steele. Of course,’ there’s
always the chance he managed to

. do that which I’ve only dreamed of:

memory loss of George W. Bush’s
presidency, in which case he must be
lauded respectfully. T

Yet despite these inaccuracies,

the rest of Steele’s comment is actu—i '

ally true. The war in Afghanistan is
likely un-winnable. To this day, 1125
American soldiers have perishedwhile
serving in Afghanistan, according to

The Washington Post. That’s not to v
mention the deaths of thousands of .p .
Afghani citizens, which, accordingto
U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, occur ‘.‘on av; v

daily basis.” .. -

The United States has lostthe sup-
port of theAfghanpeople, according
to Afghan Ambassador Said Tayeb
Jawad. It costs $1 million per year to
keep one soldier in Afghanistan. No
military tactic has been successful

in correcting these problems. And,

‘ necesS_a1'yone.’?  _   A
‘ And once again, the real truth.——

ﬁnally, we are no closer to ﬁnding

, Osamabin Laden, which, let’s notfor-
. ge_t,wasthechiefreasonforinvading

A Simply put, Steele had it right.
We need to getlout of Afghanistan,
andsoon. Butnaturally, after being
properly b*tch-slapped from every
direction, he was quick to retract his
statement and offeran“explanation”
for  iprevious corn_rnents,;though
it ,didn’t' address l_iis‘factualfae_rror_s,
merely stating, “For the sake of the

wheeled around carts containing
boxes of action ﬁgures and comic
books. Quite a few engaged in multi-
tasking, double-ﬁsting theirnachos
while negotiating the price of a ﬁrst
issue of “The Immortal Iron Fist.”
To our surprise, Liefeld wasn’t
the only person concerned with
physical ﬁtness at HeroesCon:]arnie
Eason, ful1—time spokesmodel for
Bodybuilding.com, appeared in sup-
port of an artist who sold airbrushed
images of her dressed up like Power
Girl and various other super heroes.
We had no idea who she was, but our

traveling companion and de facto
cameraman informed us that she
was some kind of big shot in the ex-
ercise world.

Since Eason was at that point
relatively unmolested by fans —— a
fact that struck us as odd, given that
tables staffed by elderly, unprepos-
sessing men were drawing sizeable
crowds —— we scored an exclusive
interview. She demonstrated her
deep understanding of real ﬁtness by
knowing the components ofvarious
CrossFit workouts, then proceeded
to tell us that we should pursue a

career in ﬁtness modeling.

“Like we don’t already . know
that” would have been our elegant
rejoinder if we were capable of either
elegance or a rejoinder after sever-
al hours spent wandering around
20,000 square feet of comics para-
phernalia. ’

Unfortunately, our interviewing
skills had become dull with disuse,
and as a consequence, we learned
very little about what Eason actually
did. Bodybuilding.com is some kind
of website for and about bodybuild-
ers, which was all the’ research we

wereable to do on a tight deadline

like this one. We didn’tvisit the site,
though, because this has been a re-
ally busy month for us. Besides, what
with the economy the way it is, who
has the time? . .

We had hoped that this column
would capture the essence of He-
roesCon, and now we realized that

. we’ve succeeded. Allow us to sum-

marize our ﬁndings: There were
some really good artists there, as
well as a bunch of obese people
and people in silly costumes. There
weren’t as many women as men. Fi-

The meat mysteryofSPAM 

A Jordan Struessnig
Staff Writer

SPAM. It’s a great source of 
SPAM.

As college students, some-
times we’Ve got to take some risky
ventures when it comes to our
cuisine because time and money
are short. But should we go so far
as SPAM? What exactly is it that is
lurking behind that well-known
label, anyhow?

According to the package,
SPAM consists of pork shoulder
meat, ham, salt, "water, modi-
fied potato starch to bind all the
yumminess together and sodium
nitrate to maintain that vibrant,
appetizing pink color.

SPAM was first created, in
1937 and was originally called
Hormel Spiced Ham. When mar-
ket share began to fall, Hormel
launched a naming competition.

‘According to WordIQ.com, SPAM

has been said to be an acronym
for Shoulder of Pork and Ham by
a Hormel official. .

However, the public has come
up with its own ideas for what
SPAM really stands for. Specially
Processed Assorted Meat, per-
haps? Or better yet, _Something
Posing As Meat? We might never
know for sure.

The ambiguity of the name,
however, has not stopped people
— college students and beyond
——- from downing can after tasty

can of the stuff. ,

SPAM saw a particularly large
rise in popularity during World
War II, especially in Hawaii where
meat was difficult to come by. Ha-
waii is still the biggest consumer
of SPAM in the world per capita,
according to WordIQ.com, con-
suming on average 5.5 cans per
second (compared with the Unit-
ed States’ 3.1 cans per second).

SPAM comes in many variet-
ies including SPAM Hot & Spicy,
SPAM Hickory Smoked and SPAM
Spread for those who’d rather just
smear it on rather than waste
their precious between-class
time slicing.

SPAM mania doesn’t stop with
just eating it, either.

' SPAMarama, a public fair ded-
icated to the consumption, ver-
satility and overall fun of SPAM,
takes place in Austin, Texas an-
nually since 1978. A

The fair is known for its no-
torious SPAM cooking competi-
tion, which has included recipes
such as Doug Holloway’s Stuffed
SPAM with Sauce a la‘ Pepto, Carl
Hickerson’s Kosher Gas Attack,
SPAM brownies and even SPAM

' ice cream.

Because SPAM, dare I say it,
doesn’t always taste great when
eaten for dessert, each judge is
allowed three “passes” for those
porcine concoctions that are less
than appealing, and, in addition

Pinter
plays on
display

Kelsey Shea
A S‘ E Editor

..From London to Pittsburgh, the
name Harold Pinter has a whole
lot of meaning in literary circles
— and this summer,’ Pittsburgh
Irish and Classical Theatre will
promote it with a festival to com-
memorate the famous writer.

Before the PICT puts on the
festival to celebrate the life and
achievements of Pinter, called
“Hearing Noise (and Laughter)

-in the Silence,” it previewed

works that the famous writer
influenced, with a series called
the “Pinteresque Storytellers
Series.”

The ﬁnal performance in the
four-part series will take place
this Monday,’]uly 12, withjoe Or-
kin’s play, “Ruffian on the Stair”
— an adaptation of Pinter’s first
play, “The Room.”

Pinter was a London-born
playwright whose plays, “The
Birthday Party,” “The Homecom-
ing” and “The Betrayal,” were
major staples on the interna-
tional theater scene in the late
’so_.s and ¢ar1y’6.0S-

He won the Nobel Prize in Lit-
erature in 2005 and the French
Légion d’honneur in 2007.

“It’s been very well received,”
said Melissa Grande, the asso-
ciate artistic director at PICT,
of the reading series. “I think
people are excited about Pinter’s
works.”

While the reading series will
end on Monday, the Pintar festi-
val will feature six plays fromjuly
22, when “The Hothouse” will be
performed, to August 22.

As to why PICT chose Pinter
to honor in its festival, Grande
said the reasons are obvious. -

«“He’s a Nobel Prize winner,
and he’s certainly one of the
most, if not the most, inﬂuen-
tial writers of the late 2o“‘ Cen-
tury,” she said. “He’s inﬂuenced
so many writers.”

Sometimes shoegaze music rocks — exam-
ples are bands like Yo La Tengo, Broken Social
Scene, Dinosaur Jr. and the Cocteau Twins.
But sometimes the genre can trip up artists
and lead them into a trap of hiding talent and
actual creativity under layers of fuzzypedal
effects and lo—‘ﬁ nonsense. Such is the case
with Weep’s new album, Worn Thin.
Surprisingly, Worn Thin’s title track is ac-
tually one of the albums weakest points. It
drones on and on with repetitive lyrics and a
steadystream of fuzzy rock that doesn’t really

 

The problems with “Worn Thin” are pretty
consistentwith the weaknesses throughout the
album. The band needs some sort of slightly
sharpened switch up inthe songs — lyrically or
musically —— to make the listener pay attention.
As it is now, the subtle vocals and lo—ﬁ tracks
just kind of drift off into the background.

Weep’s album certainly isn’t bad by any

means, though. It sounds good. Tracks like A

“When I’rn Wrong” and “Over Now” are solid
songs. ‘

The problem is that as a small-name band,
Weep needs something to distinguish itself
from the thousands of other bands out there

trying to score a bigger audience, and Worn

   

catch the ear. Thin just isn’t it. '

Grade: B-

Rocks like:

Regina Spektor and

Bethie Girmai
Staﬁ Writer

Fans of Kate Nash and Regina Spektor,
pay attention! Julia Nunes‘ is fast follow-
ing in their footsteps.

Nunes’ mellow sound and powerful
vocals create a balance that eludes most
novice musicians. Nunes’ latest EP, I
Think You Know, serves as the artist’s
declaration of empowerment.

Although Nunes’ music is teeming with
potential, her lyrics leave something to
be desired. Her words lack feeling and
give the impression that she’s trying too
hard.

 

However, Nunes makes up for what she
lacks in her lyrics with her aptitude for
melodies and multi-tasking instrumen-
tals. In addition to all the vocals and lyrics    p
on the EP, Nunes is also responsible for r ‘

the song harmonies and beatboxing.

She even plays the ukulele and the
guitar. As if her instrumental versatility
wasn’t enough, Nunes released her album
under her own record label, Rude Butler
Records. Her accomplishments exceed
those of many of her more established
peers and colleagues.

Since Nunes certainly hasn’t reached
her peak, her fans can look forward to
watching her grow as an artist.

an award for the worst submission, ac-
cording to Hubpages.com. Partying with
SPAM is a win—win situation.

Then of course there is the SPAM eating
contest, SPAM toss and SPAM tug-of-war,

' which takes place on either side of a large

pit of the meat of the hour, SPAM.

But like I said, it’s otherwise your typi-
cal, run-of—the—mill shindig.

SPAM]am, held yearly in Austin, Minn.,
is yet another celebration of this little
meaty joy. *

According to WordIQ.com, in addition
to parades, games and ﬁreworks, guests at

SPAM Jam will likely come across “copious ‘

amounts of blue and yellow [the colors
of the packaging], and myriad dancing
men and women in large SPAM can cos-
tumes.”

As Austin, Minn., is the location of the
Hormel facility that produces SPAM, it
has got even more to offer fans than the

diets across the country c

festivities of SPAM Jam.

It is also the home of the SPAM mu-
seum, where visitors can take a guided
tourthrough the history of SPAMdom, led
by an official)“SPAMbassador,” according
to Roadsideamerica.com. .

Upon entering the museum, one is con-
fronted with a large wall o’SPAM, consist-
ing of 3,390 cans stacked to the ceiling.
There are interactive activities so that

people can get an idea of what it would .

have felt like to work on a SPAM assembly
line before the advent of machinery that
does the job.

The SPAM museum also features a S
small theater — which plays a 15~minute

film about SPAM — a gift shop boasting
SPAM memorabilia, and as visitors make
their way through the facility, “the ‘Monty
Python’ cast” can “be heard singing ‘SPAM’
through a loudspeaker, over and over.”

Mmmm, I can just hear it now, and it’s
making me want to toss a can in my back-
pack for later.

Zanna ready    

for spotlight

Nigerian feeling at home on Pitt basketball team

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

' For redshirt freshman Talib Zanna,
it’s all about family —- two of them,
to be exact.

Growing up in Nigeria with

three brothers, two sisters and.

. parents who supported, him in all

N of hislendeavors, it is clear that

his immediate family played a big
role in his life. _

Now in his fourth year away
from his family while playing

basketball in the United States, .

Zanna still has some occasional
problems adjusting to being in a
foreign country without them, but
his teammates on the Pitt basket-
ball team have taken it upon them-
selves to be his second family in
his new home.

“He ﬁts in great even though
he’s from a djfferent country,”
sophomore teammate Travon
Woodall said. “We all embrace
him. That’s the good thing about
this team is that we’re always to-
gether, so we make everybody feel
comfortable.”

“We’re all close,” Zanna said.

“.We’re like.family. Wejoke around

and have fun.”

Although he may be thou-
sands of miles away from them,
the 6—foot—9 Zanna still talks to his
family on a regular basis over the
phone. But he can no longer talk to

the one person in his life who has .

meant the most to him.

Zanna’s father, whom he con-
siders his idol, died shortly after
Zanna committed to Pitt.

“That was a real tough mo-
ment for me. It’s a tough thing to
handle,” Zanna said. “But I had a
lot of people who gave me support
and gave me good advice.”

Zanna has a picture of his dad in
his locker and touches it before ev-
ery game while saying a prayer for
him. He can speak ﬁve languages
and hopes to one day follow in his
father’s footsteps and become an

0

international businessman, which
is why he is majoring in business.

He wasn’t able to make it back
to Nigeria since being in the United

States — even for his father’s fu- .

neral —— and his family has never

been to the United S.tates,’but he’

hopes they can take the long trip to
Pittsburgh to see him play.
Playing soccer as a kid, Zanna’s
brother encouraged him to try
basketball because of his height
advantage, and he was ﬁrst discov-
ered by U.S. high school basketball
coaches at a big man camp in La-
gos, Nigeria, run by his mentor
_and former Georgetown player,
Godwin Owinje. ‘
It was at that camp four years
ago where Bishop McNamara High
School coach Marty Keithline rec-
ognized Zanna’s abilities, and after
a lot of long talks and paperwork,
Zanna decided to leave his family

to travel to the Forestville, Md., W

prep school to pursue his dream
of playing basketball against top
competition in the United States.

“I was scared because I was at
a young age,” Zanna said. _Yet his

family stood by his decision be-

cause they knew just how much
basketball meant to him.

Zanna instant1y‘be’c”ame ‘a star

at McNamara, averaging a double-

before eventually guiding themvto a
No.‘ 3 ranking in the state his senior
year, when he averaged 14.6 points
and 11.8 rebounds per game.
While playing there he lived
with a host family, the Bazilios,
who treated him like he was one of
their own and made him feel like
he was a part of the family. One
of the main reasons Zanna felt so

at home there was because Ralph.

Bazilio ‘was from Guyana and be-
came a successful businessman in
the United States.

“He’s somebody like me,” Zan- '

na said. “We talk probably two or
three times every week and they
visit me sometimes.”

them in Maryland, he moved on to Pitt upon
as one of the most coveted recruits in the
D.C. metro area, a region loaded with high
school talent.

He believes the redshirt season this year
will be beneﬁcial for him, allowing him to
take a year to further acclimate to the Ameri-
can lifestyle as well as giving himself more
time to grasp head coachjamie Dixon’s sys-
tem.

“The redshirt’s going to help me a lot,”
Zanna said. “It’s going to make me learn a
lot from offense and defense and get ready
for next year.”

It seems to be paying off already, as he has
been one of the top players in this summer’s
Pro—Am league in Greentree. Through four
games he’s averaging 12.8 points and 10.3
; rebounds per game. H
 While that might be a surprise to some,
 the people who watched Zanna in practice

last season saw this coming.
Former Pitt guard Jermaine Dixon com-
‘ pared Zanna’s natural abilities to a recent
Panther great, saying, “If he works on his
; ball handling I think he can be as good as
 Sam Young. His rebounding is great, and he
 can shoot the ball.” . _ ' Photos courtesy Pitt‘ Athletics

 Stanley Cup visits

Burke 4 10

ed the Chicago Annual PrideParade on
behalf of the Chicago Blackhawks, this was
hardly the case. Sopel was simply holding
it because the true champion of; the day
was no longer around t_o do so.

In February, 21—year-old’Brendan
Burke’s, car skidded outof control and
collided with an oncoming truck, killing
both him and a friend. Burke is the son of
Brian Burke, the general manager of the
Toronto Maple Leafs and Team USA. .

Brendan Burke made headlines backin
November when it was revealed to the Mi-
ami University (Ohio) men’s hockey team,
for which" he was a team manager, and to
multiple news outlets that he was gay.

In the weeks after he came out, Burke

1 and his family told the story of his journey,

and he quickly became a trailblazer for gay
athletes everywhere. Members of his fam-
ily (whom he had come out to in 2007), the
members of the hockey team and countless
figures in hockey circles applauded Burke’s
strength and courage. '

The Stanley Cup’s appearance in Chi— 1

cago’s pride parade was the result of a
classy, honorable_move by Sopel and the
Blackhawks —_ one that speaks volumes
to the impact that Brendan Burke had on
both the world of hockey and the sports
universe as a whole. ,

While those who knew Burke began to
reconsider their stances on homosexual-
ity within athletics, many in the sporting
world have not. ‘ '

There have been a wide variety of reac-
tions to cases of notable athletes coming
out, both positive — as in Burke’s case
— and negative.

Chicago Pridg Parade  

“iuqlfy.

*A Even in the most liberal places, homo-
geixual stereotypes can make the life of a
gay athlete remarkably stressful. Pitt fans
might remember the late Ed Gallagher, a
defensive tackle for Pitt’s football team in
the late 1970s, who attempted suicide in
1985 because he was unable to reconcile
his sexuality with his perception of what
it meant to be an athlete.

* While American society has become
increasingly progressive in its percep-

. tions of homosexuality, athletics have been

slow to follow suit. The problem is that
athletes are socialized to follow a model
for success. For instance, little leaguers
are t_aught to use a certain batting stance
because it worked well for many players in
the past. When it comes to sexuality, there

aren’t many legendary athletes who were

openly gay, which can make homosexuality
especially difficult for athletes.

What Burke, hissfamily and his team-
mates did was so groundbreaking, because
they simply did not make a big deal out of
Burke’s sexuality. They didn’t cast it in a
negative light, and they didn’t celebrate it.
They made clear that nothing had changed
and that Burke was still the same person
he always had been.

As they told their story to the world,
they taught athletes and fans a valuable
lesson: that sexual orientation has nothing
to do with athletics.

The sporting world still has a long way
togo before sexual orientation becomes
as unimportant to sports as race is today.
However, after the Stanley Cup’s landmark
appearance at the Chicago Annual Pride
Parade, the future looks bright.
