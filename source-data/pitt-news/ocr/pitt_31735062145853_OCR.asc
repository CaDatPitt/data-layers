Seven per cent of the Freshman
class, and sixteen percent of the
"Sophomore class are on the academic

honor lists of their respective classes, .
according to an announcement made.

by B. F. Ashes. undergraduate ad-
visor. Quantity has been considered

for the first time this year in deter-,

mining the lists. According to the
newly adopted. system the
who carries a heavy academic load
and still maintains a high duality of,
work, receives greater recognition
than the one, who with a lighter load,-
makes the same --grades. ,
Rankings of the students have been
computed in the following manner:
Each, grade is given a ~‘ numerical

-value, for example, “A”, the highest

grade, has the value of ‘11, and “F”,
the lowest grade, is rated at 1. The
value of the grade is multiplied by
the number of -credits a course car-
ries, and the resulting total is known
as the product. In this way the stu-
dents total number of products is ob-
tained, and added together. Honor
students must have a total number
of points of 100, or over.

In keeping. with thelalmost univer-

training in the education of the mod-
ernstudent, the University Council
has taken steps that will place'Pl1ys-
ical Education and R. O. T, C. on the
same level as academic subjects by
granting credits for gym and R. O.
T. C. training. The new regulation
reads: / 

“Physical. education and the work
of the -R. O, T. C. will be allowed
University credit, the proper amount
of credits in each department being
included in the 120 credits now re-
quired for graduation. This"is strict-
ly a Freshman and Sophomore re-
quirement. The swimming test re-
quirement is sti11.,in effect.”

The above ruling is effective imme-
diately and applies to all Freshmen,
Sophomores,.and Seniors. Junior stu-
dents are required to show evidence
of four passing grades (not credits)

for graduation. The Department of

You won t fumble this cap!
1 _ Professional jugglers could handle the old-
1 style shaving cream caps and never once drop
one down the ‘drain or under the bath tub.

But for most of us, this new Williams.Hinge'-
Cap puts an end-to an-ancient nuisance.

. Williams Shaving Cream is just.as fnuch
pleasanter to use as isrthe Hinge‘-Cap. _It
softens the. heard with uncannyspeed. The
thicker lather holds the moisture in against
the skin where ‘it is needed. This lather lu-
bricates the skin, too, so that painful ‘razor
friction is eliminated. And when your shave -
is done, ,that famous ingredient in Williams A
which helps the skin, leaves your face cool,
soothed and refreshed. No coloring matter
is“ used in Williams ——it is a pure, natural-
white shaving "cream. ‘ ' «

Shaving Cream.

  Owes to Faith

HE pioneer harnessing of Niagara Falls
in 189%, like all great engineering’ feats, . .
was the result of the co-operation of many_ V
able and constructive minds. here were no
“older engineers” on this work, with younger
assistants, as is now common, because‘ there
were no ‘ ‘older’ ’ engineers then. All of them were
young men in a young business, optimistic,‘
enthusiastic and willing. to take long chances.
The original Niagara installation‘ represented prog-
ress based largely on-faith because there were many
feaiuresﬁof construction proposed at that time -which
Westinghouse Engineers -refused to accept, and which
time has shown to be utterly impracticable.
Thus, in effecting a "compromise, the three funda-
mental features of heating-, insulation and regulation
of the 25-cycle machines as built, were vastly different
from the original designs.
ment, the ten original generators operating success-
fully for -more than a quarter of a century.
Looking back, it is gratifying that those young men
served engineering so courageously, because truly, it
was an undertaking that taxed their faith to‘ the limit.

 plan for the annual presentation of a. cup to the University of Pitts-

 recognition of tennis ability been given to any individual.

Each year the individual cllampion’s
