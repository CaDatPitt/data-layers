This is Claude Huyghes, a little
Frenchman. His hair is blonde
and his eyes are green. He has
1000 fathers, a mother, an older

brother. and a sister. 0
Members of the IF council have
‘adopted’ Claude to help ﬁnance
-. his schooling and to give him a"
start in.America. His father, who
was in the Fesi:-:tance movement,
was seized by the Germans .and
publicity executed. With an abun-

‘'-*dance of doting fathers at Pitt,

"Claude can once again, smile.
He and his family knew much

last year,” Balaban explained.

Various choral groups have
planned a series of carols for the
event. Women’s Choral will sing
Brahms’ “Lullaby”; and Men’s
Glee- club, Bach’s “Now' Let Every
Tongue Adore4Thee.” The Pitt
Singers, a mixed group, plan to
sing “Lo What a Beauteous Rose,”
by Praetorius.

Gel  7/re Banal Wagm

“Pitt sure ain’t what it usedto be.” There ’s a wistful

which" occurred in his alma mater while he was away to the
wars. He longs for the good old days for, despite the unpre-
cedented throngs thatt elbow through Cathedral halls and the
revival of activities that closed shop in the spring of ’42,
he is disturbed by the lack of one of the intangibles that should
. characterize normal college life. An atmosphere of indifference

that pervades the place makes even the lean years‘ seem to
him a hectic memory. ‘

The unnatural apathy can be attributed in part to the
inﬂux of veterans who did not have the opportunity to attend
. college before the war and who stubbornly insist that they want
._no part of collegiate ex'tra—curriculars along with their edu-
cation. A goodly percentage of them are tacitly organized into
a distinctive class of individuals who want nothing from Pitt
abut to clutch their sheepskin four years hence and, in the
meantime, to. be left very much alone.

If they participate in. activities it will be as “Vets”
rather than as college students. In the spirit of this p_recocious
faction, a petition was submitted to the Public’Uti1ities Com-
mission recommending special rates for veteran students only——
this nothwithstanding the fact that there is many a commuter
who is going through Pitt on -a ﬁnancial shoestring and would
I have proﬁted from a saving in reduced fares. With the same
shortsightedness a group of engineers took a rather perverse
V pride in sponsoring a semi-formal dance which bolted univer-
‘ sity tradition for noapparent reason——there Wercweak mur-
murings about convenience. These same iconoclasts feel that
enthusiasm for athletics is adolescent, membership in organiza-
tions only for the “wheels,” and attendance at Pitt socials
restricted to the country-club set. ‘ _

This anti-social attitude is more puerile than the vet
imagines campus participation and cooperation to be; here
is the embryo of a cast system which the veteran admittedly
detests but which he now inadvertently supports on the
basis of wholly erroneous precepts. The case is clearly cut:
Does the ex-serviceman prefer to have colle e a. mere dip-
loma factory or an institution where he mayg seek personal
as well as intellectual development. If the student of today
achieves the success to which he aspires, he then will as-
sociate with former collegians in pleasure as well as in
business. Savior faire is recognized as contributing as much
to advancement as academic enlightenment but there are
as yet no classes inpersonal growth and social graces. »

» It is impossible to look at the college world through GI
glasses and get anything but a distorted perspective. Educa-
tion and its social ramiﬁcations belong to a civilian world. A
change to multi-sentiments should be as pleasant as was the
change from khakies to tweeds and cravats. The discharge but-
ton commands respect but it is not a skeleton key to success.
When the “I had it rough” complex has been packed away in
mothballs, initiative and independence will bring the veterans
to the position at Pitt left vacant pending his delayed anima-
tion. I .

j _ The guys who were at Saipan, the Bulge, and Iwo can shift
Pitt into high gear; when the cry “c’mon Pitt” rings out, let’s
hope they’re on the bandwagon.

Editor, Pitt News:

Regardless. of what some of the
Pitt students think, I wish deﬁ-
nitely to go on record as disap-
pointed in the vet movement at
the University of Pittsburgh. We
who have been on campus for the
past few years have waited anx-
iou/sly for the return of a full
population and especially for the
veterans. There was a group of

older, more serious men who
could get things done, we were
told. At least our hopes were real-
ized: they came, not by hundreds
but’ by thousands. Our college
was on, its way back to the old
pre-war style. Again it was pos-

the Schenley High sch-ool students
on Fifth avenue. Mature, hand-
some, pipe—smoking “college men”
were back. We waited for the re-
sults.

A few weeks were required for
orientation to the new mode of
life. But we were not worried:
the vets were organizing. A num-
ber of ideas were said to be brew-
ing. At last they were orientated;
they were going to attack a ma-
jor issue, we heard. A new stu-
dent rate on the city’s street car
system was to be obtained. But
we who watched and waited, and
secretly hoped, were disappointed.
The vets were going the way of
all self-centered», special-interest
groups with the proverbial axe to
grind. A fraternity group could
have been no more discriminat-
ing. ‘The veterans with all the
training in democratic living that
their very rghame implies were

public utility —— for vets alone!

What of the thousands of other
people who attend Pitt, those too
young for service, rejected, or the
female population? Shadyside, for
them, is just as many blocks away
and the temperature will become
just as cold for all. If Pitt can be

Earson Well Pleased     1
With Hard Court Five

They’re great! That’s Dr. Har-
old C. Carlson’s opinion of this
years Pitt cagers.

You might expect a gloomy out-
look after the Panthers dropped
three games in their second west-
ern .swing. But Carlson sums it up
this way:

“We could have won two of
the three. I don’t say we were
better than Butler and North-
western but we lost by two-
point margins in both games.”
He was high in his praise of,
Illinois, “There’s no doubt that
they outclassed us.”

“That’s the fourth year the
Whiz Kids have been playing
together. Too much experience.
We trailed by ten points at one so
time but they -poured in fresh
subs and overwhelmed us with
15 points in ﬁve minutes.”

A ﬁrst year squad usually com-
mits plenty of errors and Pitt is
no exception. However, the Pan-
ther‘ mentor ﬁgures -the mistakes
which lost the ﬁrst four games
will play dividends later in the
season.

Pitt does not have a permanent
practice court which may be one
reason for the poor showing. They
have .been using Trees gym when
it is available. Other practices
have been held at the second floor‘
gym of The Gardens.

‘A New. Range of Color Eﬁects

After the method of transferring wet
pigment particles -had been established,
the second development in this program
was the practical utilization‘ of precipi-
tated ferric hydroxide. Although it had
been used for a long time as an inter-
mediate for the manufacture of dry fer-
ric oxide pigment, ferric hydroxide in
the wet form as a pigment had been ap-

_ plied only to as very limited extent and
its true value had gone unrecognized.

. When used in conjunction with the new
process, wet ferric hydroxide produced
a lacquer of unusual brilliance and dur-
ability. ‘In combination with other pig-
ments, a whole new range of color effects

Because of their extremely small pig-
ment particle—size, the Metalli-Chromes
are somewhat translucent, having a dis-
tinctive, soft innerglow. This lustrous
depth is further enhanced by introducing
into the ﬁlm aluminum particles which
act like mirrors to reﬂect the light with- '

Not only are these new lacquer ﬁn-
ishes more lustrous and more beautiful,

' but_they are also more durable, as proved
by four years of laboratory and road-
testing. "Duco” Metalli-Chrome lac-

Honored This Mbnth .

Thirteen modiﬁed football rules, two peach baskets, “a soc-8
cer ball, and eighteen players made up the ﬁrst basketball game

55 years ago this month.

It happened in 1891 at the International YMCA training .
school, now _Spr-ingﬁeld college. The creator was Dr. James Nai- 
smrth, physical instructor at the school. One of his classes, a.
group of prospective Y secretar-O ‘ I

ies, had lost all interest in gym-
nastics. So Dr. Naismith sat at
his office desk and groped toward
a solution.

It was while analyzing Ameri-
can football that, like Archimedes
and his disc,overer’s cry of “Eure-
ka,” he jerked erect in his chair,
snapped his ﬁngers and shouted,
“I’Ve got it!” .

With two peach baskets obtain-'

ed from the school janitor, a has-
tily written list of 13 rules, and
a soccer ball, Dr. Naismith faced
his class the following morning.
He divided the group of 18 into
two opposing teams and posted
them on the improvised court.

Success was instantaneous.
Word spread through the school
that “Naismith’s class was having
fun.” Basketball was born‘. By

Christmas time, 1891, the hoop
sport had invaded the far corners
of the country, carried aﬁeld by
vacationing Y students.

The game spread faster than a
nasty rumor. In three years it was

Frenchmen played the game in

1901. Today there are millions of, '

 Alpha Phi Alpha Supports
. Movement To Oust Bilbo

A The Pitt Sphinx club, a member of a national organization of
Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity pledges, has joined a nation wide move-
ment to oust Senator Theodore G. Bilbo from the United States
Senate, according to Joseph Jordan, head of the Pitt committee.

The group petition reads: We, the undersigned, urge you to
do all in your power to see that Theodore Bilbo, Senator ‘from
Mississippi, will be denied a U. S.¢
Senate seat tc which he has been
recently elected. We solemnly feel
that he is unﬁt to sit with honest
representatives in a respectable
legislative body.

Stopped in an effort to obtain
University backing by Pitt’s non—
political policy, the club is pro-
ceeding on its own to ﬁll the pe-
tition which will be submitted to
Senator Edward Martin.
