UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

GSPIA to Hear
Housing Authority

The ‘seventh fall assembly of the Graduate School of
Public and Internati‘onal Affairs (GSPIA) will be held
Nov. 24, at 8 pm. in Stephen Foster Memorial. Richard
C.‘ Weaver, administrator of the Federal Housing and
Finance Agency and an authority on the problems of
urban housing, will speak on “Public Service in an Urban

Society.”

Weaver received his baccala-
urate, his M.A. and Ph.D. at Har-
vard University. In 1933, he be-
came the associate advisor on Ne-
gro affairs in the Department of
the Interior, becoming the ad-
visor in 1934.

He also served as consultant
with the Housing Division of the
Public Works Administration, un-
der which the ﬁrst public housing.
and slum clearance projects were
built as part of the emergency
program during the depression.

In New York, Weaver has serv-
ed as a member of the board of
directors of the Citizens Housing
and Planning Council. He has
been a director and a member
of the Executive and Research
Committee of ACTION, Inc., a
national citizens organization
which advocated renewal of
blighted urban .areas and assists
local communities to combat
slums. President Kennedy swore
him into present office in Feb-
ruary, 1961.

Mr. Weaver, in addition, has
written two books: Negro Labor;
3. National Problem and The Ne-
gro Ghetto, on the minority hous-
ing problem. He has received
honorary degrees from Temple,
Rutgers and Howard universities,
and Boston and Elmira Colleges.

The Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs was
formed seven years ago. It has
an enrollment of approximately
200 persons from all over the
world and offers degrees in pub-
lic administration, urban affairs,
economic and social development,
and international affairs.

The students are preparing for
leadership in public and inter-
national service.

Mellon Talk
Set Tonight

Professor Alexander Parker,
visiting Andrew Mellon profes-
sor of romance languages and lit-
eratures, will open the Mellon
Lecture Series at 8:15 p.mm. to-
night in the Public Health Audi-
torium. “The Picaresque Novel in
Spain” will be his topic.

Parker, professor of hispanic
studies at the University of Edin-
boro, is considered an expert in
the Golden Age of Spanish Liter-
ature. Dr. Rodolfo Cardona, act-
ing chairman of the romance lan-
guages department, considers him
“one of the best Hispanists in the
World today. Since the picaresque
is a universal genre, students of
any nation’s literature, should be
interested in Professor Parker’s
lecture,” Cardona said.

Parker will give a second lec-
ture Thursday on ‘_‘Literature and
the Delinquent.”

Dr. Dragan Plamenac, Mellon
professor of music, is scheduled
to deliver the third talk in the
series Dec. 7.

Greek Week Planned for March; »
Schedule, Chairmen Announced  
Program Includes Service Project

FUN AND frolic maybe paramount to these students in the ons
Room as one tries to see the University from perhaps a new and bet-
ter angle. In short time, however, ﬁnals will make all angles “blique.”

The annual Greek Week
Program, scheduled this year
for March 8-13, will include
a service project which will
help either the University
or a charitable organization.
It will be the ﬁrst time such
a project has been included
in Greek Week activities.

Tentative plans call for the
weekend to open Monday,
March 8, with a fun night.
The evening will consist of
skits, games and a chariot
race.

The following night has
been set aside for studying

Ray De Fade’s

By nanny SHAW

Two things are necessary for a big band
to make good music. Not only must the
musicians themselves be first rate, but they
must sound like a coordinated group, held
together by their conductor and their ar-
rangements. The Ray De Fade. Jazz Band
had just these qualities at the PM Series
Thursday night.

The De Fade band was originally formed as a
student band from Duquesne University, but it has
greatly expanded to allow membership to any mu-
sician in the Pittsburgh area. It has taken ﬁrst
prize at the Villanova and the Three Rivers Jazz
Festivals.

Playing old standards, as well as up to date
compositions by Sonny Rollins, Thelonius Monk,
and members of the band, and through the use of
creative accompaniment, the big band actually

served to highlight the musicianship of the soloist.

Credit for all this, must go to Ray De Fade. Most
of the arrangements were by him, and when others
Weren't S010iI18‘, he was improvising on the saxo-
phone or ﬂute. In “Fly Me to the Moon” the ﬂute
soared above the hushed band, in a ﬁightly effect,
perfect for this number. In “Rica’s Dream” and “I'll
Remember April,” De Fade soloed on the saxo-
phone in an equally effective manner.

The other soloists proved that they could meas-
ure up to De Fade in every way. Nelson Harisson,
a University student, soloed on the bass trombone,
in “When Sunny Gets Blue.” His style, reminiscent
of Harold Betters was especially bluesy due to the
muted trombones in the accompaniment. Paul Hu-
binon’s crystal clear tones on the trumpet, per-
meated every number that the band did, and the
drum solo by Lou Carto was a lesson in furious‘
rhythms and sustained co-ordination.

R’eviews:

By MATTHEW NEVISKY
William S. Burroughs has

;fij_ fallen victim of the Grove
;:j.,Press syndrome —- or sin
drone, if you will.

The author of that sub-

 terraneanly - praised book,

Naked Lunch (Grove Press;

Of 255 Pages; $6), publishes his fall
‘ , with the fall publication of his

latest effort, Nova Express (Grove
Press; 187 Pages; $5).

For the uninitiated, Grove Press
is a publishing company which
specializes in obscenity, mild lit-
erary experimentation, gibberish
and, occasionally, some of the
ﬁnest serious literature of our
day. Included in the Grove stable
are Henry Miller, Jean Genet,
Jean-Paul Sartre and a horde of
other, lesser known, but noisy
writers.

The Grove Press Sin Drone is
this: a ‘ writer of promise, for
some inexplicable reason, breaks
his promise and begins submerg-
ing his worth in a helter-skelter

" spray of dirty words, phrases and

scenes, experimental but ineffec-
tive punctuation, and surrealistic
but slap-dash literary structure.
The Grove people complete the
job with their high prices, cheap
bindings, and typically poor typo-
graphy job: Naked Lunch, for ex-
ample, has enough misprints in
it to remind one of those porno-
graphic typewritten stories that
used to be circulated around the
dormitory, even though the book
is now in its seventh printing.
Burroughs knows this route
very well. In Naked Lunch, he
promised and, to great extent,
delivered. In Nova Express he

Two Law School
Students Speak
At Moot Court

Two University law students
will represent the Law School in
the 15th annual National Moot
Court Competition Friday and
Saturday. Louis J. Timchak and
Robert D. Rowley, third year stu-
dents, will compete against seven
other schools in the regional com-
petition in Newark, N. J.

The 21 winners in the regions,

- which were arbitarily established

according to the geographical dis-
tribution of law schools, will go
to New York for the ﬁnal com-
petition the second week in De-
cember, The competition is spon-
sored by the Young Lawyers
Committee of New York City's
Bar Association.

The law students will present

I an appellate court case, before a

panel of judges for a reversal or
upholding of a lower court deci-
sion. Timchak and Rowley are
arguing for a reversal of the law-
er court decision in hypothetical
jurisdiction and products liabil-
ity case called “Mike Mitosis,
respondent, against Honest Sam's
Fission & Fusion Ltd. and Nu-
Kitchens Inc., appellent.”

The judging is based two-thirds
on oral argument (30 minutes
long) and one-third on the
strength of the brief.

topon, diocodid, diosane, opium,
demerol, dolophine, palﬁum and
a ‘host of other addictive and
non-addictive drugs for close to
20 years, originally published
Naked Lunch in bits and pieces
in a number of quarterlies over
a number of years. It was ulti-
mately organized and re-shaped
into hard-cover form in 1959, and
has just been released again with
Burroughs’ new book. Lunch re-
cords impressions, experiences
and ideas of the author while
under the inﬂuences of the vari-
ous kinds of junk. _

The book’s introduction and ap-
pendix affords a fascinating guide
to the various scenes of the book:
the reader may amuse himself by
ﬁguring out which drug has
caused which hallucination. And
while the book lacks a formal
structure — Burroughs calls the
book “notes” and not a novel — a
kind of structure emerges, as the
narrator climbs deeper and deep-
er into the hell of druggery, and
then back out. Through it all
runs splendid threads of descrip-
tion, inventiveness, anguish, hun-
ger and, oddly enough, brilliant
humor.

Nova Express has none of the
virtues of its predecessor -— a

 ‘Naked Lunch’

  

pure product of the Grove Press
Sin Drone. It has foul language
without even the strength of foul
thought. It exhibits experimental
punctuation and phrasing but
with traditional grammatical
scheme. If it is prose it has the
structure of hot saurkraut in wet
kleenex. If it is a long poem, it is
devoid of any poetical devices.
It has unfunny humor, stale in-
vention and only one unifying
element: monotony. That we can
bet by staring at the dust jacket.

The author’s satiric talent, of-
ten so highly-touted (often by
Burroughs), is completely lost
here. The interplanetrary cops-
and-robbers motif, effective if
handled carefully, is quickly
nixed by a ﬁix in the first few
chapters. If we must have inter-
planetary adventures, make my
Burroughs Edgar Rice. The sum of

Nova Express is an inter-galactic * *

zero.

So the Grove Press people have
struck again: a talented and in-
telligent writer has succumbed
to’ Grove Pressure. Naked Lunch

is a fascinating document, but‘

Nova Express, this new package
of phrases strung together with
hyphens, cannot even be consi-
dered a bad book.

‘Playboy’ Philosophy
Protestant Product

By Bob Supansic

Rabbi Richard. Rubenstein
spoke last Wednesday in Din-
ing Rooms A and B of the
Student Union on “The Play-
boy Philosophy.” He spoke
without the use of notes (as

usual) or visual aids (unfor-
tunately).

Playboy publisher Hefner's
philosophizing, the Rabbi said,
was the product of a peculiarly
Protestant environment. He traced
the modern, embivalent attitude
of complete abstention in sexual
mores or unbridaled libertinism
.as a tradition dating from St.
Augustine who at one point in
his writings says, “. . . give me
chastity, oh Lord, but not yet . . .”

Martin Luther’s Reformation
was a move away from Thomas
Acquinas back to Augustine; thus,
the duality of ﬂesh and spirit
found its way into Protestant
thought.

Hefner," he went on to add, re-
ﬂects ’ this attitude because the
Playboy Philosophy represents a
crusade against the concept of
abstinance on one hand without
attempting to qualify its position
on the other. That, he remarked,
is always promised in “some fu-
ture installment.”

Looking at the rest of Playboy
from a psychoanalytical point of
view, he found the magazine dis-
turbing, He felt thatthe maga-
zine’s obsession with certain
parts of the female anatomy and
its refusal to reveal the full fe-
male ﬁgure as being “teasing,”

  
 
   

    

stimulation without gratiﬁcation.

Enlarging upon this, Rabbi Ru-
benstein explained the b.asic
Freudian interpretation of sexual
growth in the boy and the girl.
The socially accepted sexual re-
lationship between a man and a
woman is a secondary develop-
ment after the traumatic redef-
inition of the objects of sex
drives in childhood. The only sex-
ual freedom is of .a “genuinely,
mutually gratifying sexual ex-
perience. “The best relationship
for allowing the mutual gratiﬁ-
cation to occur is the marital
one; only then can the slow pro-
cess of overcoming the obstacles
to adult sexual gratiﬁcation.

A spirited question and answer
period followed.

The advising system for
underclassmen at the Uni-
versity has reached a peak
in effectiveness and efficien-
cy, according to James G.
Watson of the Liberal Arts
Advising Center. Yet, fresh-
men, who are supposedly receiv-
ing maximum beneﬁts, are not
altogether satisﬁed with the re-
sults.

A poll taken among University
freshmen shows that for every
three students who are satisﬁed,
there are two who are not, al-
though procedures have been es-
tablished to insure the prepared-
ness of the advisors and, to im-
prove the system in general.

Two years ago, Watson said,
the center evolved a strict system
and stabilized its hiring policies.
Each .applicant must be in an ad-

vanced stage of his graduate
work, fulfilling a minimum re-
quirement of one year.

Hired in ‘the spring term for a
two-year period, the advisor par-
ticipates in an orientation session
for one-and-a-half weeks. During
this period he is familiarized with
the curriculum and its purpose.
Each department is carefully
gone over,. course by course.

Each advisor, who is assigned
to an average of 150 students,
spends 15 hours each week in the
Advising Center during the aca-
demic term. During the ﬁrst two
weeks of each trimester, he is in
his office eight hours a ‘day. In
the ﬁve-week registration period,
the advisor schedules 30 half-
hour appointments a week.

Complaints are prevalent, how-
ever, concerning the inefficiency
of the system itself and of the

individual advisors. One fresh-
man girl stated that hervadvisor
had not been familiar with the
latest bulletin for the School of
Education during her ﬁrst term
and had therefore failed to in-
form her of the requirements.
Another boy’s advisor was un-
acquainted with the electivesfor
engineers.

One student’s advisor told her

Deﬁciencies, such as discrepan-

several students, show that the

improved from the center of a

from fulﬁlling its goals of per-
fecting and stabilizing itself.

No Chance To Get Nervous

Sylvia Shapiro Sings to Johnson

By LINDA WERLINICH

Singing to the President of
the United States is enough
to make any college’ student
nervous. But liberal arts
sophomore Sylvia Shapiro
never had a chance to get
nervous when she sang to
President Johnson at the Civic
Arena. She wasn’t sure she was
singing until 15 minutes before
she went on stage.

Miss Shapiro said, “No one
was sure who was singing. There
was another singer who was sup-
pose to do it. Finally a man came
up and ‘told me I was going to
sing “Hello Lyndon” to the Presi-
dent in 15 minutes. I was afraid
I’d forget the words. I don’t even
remember the man’s name.

“There were so many people
. . . I had dreamed of singing for
the President, but I never expect-
ed the dream to come tru .”

About two weeks before Miss
Shapiro sang for President John-
son, Nate Firestone had chosen

her to sing “Hello, Hubert” for‘

senator Humphrey when he spoke
at the University. Firestone was
coordinator of Young Citizens for
Johnson-Humphrey for the ﬁve
Pittsburgh colleges and two jun-

ior colleges. While she was wait-
ing for the band to start playing,
Senator Humphrey shook her
hand and asked her name. “He
acted just like he was my favor-
ite uncle,” she remarked.

Miss Shapiro, a French major,
started singing when she was
three-years-old. When she was 12,
she appeared every Sunday morn-
ing on the “Children’s Hour,” a
two hour program.

.“I enjoy singing in college,” she
said. She also remarked that she
likes to sing all typespof music
‘but particularly enjoys contem-
porary songs and show tunes. “I
don’t think I want to go into the
entertainment world, though.”

A couple of weeks ago, she had
been planning to cut a rock and
roll record for Dot Records. Dot
was worried ‘because Miss Sha-
piro is 18-years-old and they had
previously signed some minors
who had broken their contracts.

Realizing that the expected
personal appearances would in-
terfere with her school work, she
and Dot both decided against re-
cording the record. She intends
to wait until after graduation be-
fore deciding whether or not to
»make a record.

j lifetimes.

  

The proposal to be discuss

' the option of having no hours. "The ‘seven senior women who proposed this did so to

encourage responsibility, to permit those women eligible to be able to choose the way

Since they“ submitted this idea to Women’s Housing Board‘ several weeks ago,
however, the reaction has been most curious. There have been those who have considered
the proposal in the spirit in which it was made, and have decided that it is a decision
which i's the right for a senior woman _to make._ And there have also been those who

H‘ have reacted without thinking, both pro or con, and it is to these students that Wednes-

 

 day’s panel and.Thursday’s vote will be a challenge.

\

_ , On the one hand therehave been women who automatically vetoed the proposal
,_ ;’~with a type ofrighteous .ho",r_ror.‘ .-Despite the fact that seniors will be out on their
is  own within a few months, they are not old enough now to start accepting responsi-
 pbility. The University must protect them until they are no longer responsible for

them.

Equally unthinking  the 8iroup_that looks upon this option as a license rather
than a responsibility. The idea, glimmers as gay abandon-—until they stop to think.

 I The women of this University owe it to their educational experience to let them-

 selves be challenged by thinking through this proposal, by attending the panel dis- _
 cussion Wednesday with an open mind, by being honest with themselves rather than
 operating on an unthinking prejudice one way or the other.

' " This proposal itself is a mature one, suggested by women who have proved ‘their
own distinction and are urging the rest of the women students to recognize their re-
sponsibility. And the ﬁrst signs of it must come with their basic consideration of the
proposal and of‘ themselves beforewe know if this campus is ready for sucha mature

 ' step.

The New Society

By Irv Garfinkel

Fundamental changes in
our economic system are re-
sulting from automation._

.  Some men, as I pointed out
 in my last article, believe
» that our economy will be un-
able to provide jobs for up
to‘2.0 per cent of our work-
ing. population. They pro-
pose. therefore, that we di-
3   vorce -income
 from work,
:sthrough a
} government
guaranteed
Income. First
V -I would like
‘ to consider in
greater detail
the objections
, ‘ ' Ihave to such
GARFINKEL a solution.
Then I wouldplike to offer an
alternative. ‘

This group that didn’t
‘work would in all probability
become a class apart from
the _rest of society. Instead

of increasing mobility with-
’- in the social structure, lead
a plan would, I think, lead
to a. rigidiﬁed class structure.
At the bottom wo11ld be our
20 per cent of unemploy-
ables, an alien group. I would
like to consider one more
objection.-

   
    
 
  
 
    
     
    

dignity I believe, by contri-
buting at least something to
his society. While I am not
worried about the supposed
degenerating inﬂuences leis-
ure would have on the mass-
es, I am concerned about the
effect of telling a sizeable
minority of the population
that there is nothing they
can contribute to our society.

M YET I DON’T think it is

necessary to tell a sizeable
- I minority of our population
" ‘that there are no jobs for
‘ them. Automation is elimin-

fating jobs. The jobs being

 

A man derives a certain _

The

in production. Automation

enables us to produce more

and more with fewer and
fewer men. But these people
can be employed in the serv-
ice area of our economy.

For example right now
one of the fastest growing
industries in the country is
recreation. As our population
and the available time for
leisure increases, recreation
will grow even faster. We
need many more people to
run _and care for our nation-
al, state and local parks.

Our cities are disgraceful-

ly ugly. We not only have to A

rebuild them so that they
are beautiful, but we have
to make sure they stay beau-
tiful. Automation makes us
wealthy enough as a society
to be able to build, not
just economically useful, but
beautiful cities. I jokingly
told a friend that I'd like to
run for political office on the
plank of a “park on every
street corner.” Just think
how many more gardeners
we’l1.need ! I only hope every-
one is aware of the serious
thoughts underlying the jest.

There are many other serv-
ice areas, that will require
manpower. Every one of our
social services for example
needs to be expanded. We
need more teachers and so-
cial workers just to take two
areas. In order to ﬁll these
needs, however, We will -have
to drastically improve the
quality of our educational
system.

BY NOW IT should be be-
coming apparent from this
brief discussion that automa-
tion will bring about a fun-
damental shift from an em-
phasis on the private sector
of the economy to an em-
phasis on the public service
sector of the economy. Not

‘ only will the _. national gov-

ernment have to set broad
plans to guide the private
economy as Senator Joseph
Clark suggests, but all lev-
els of government will in-
creasingly become major em-
ployers.

The national, state, and lo-
cal governments will have to
provide these jobs for two
reasons. First the private
sector‘ of the economy can
not possibly generate enough
jobs now, let alone ten or 20
years hence. Second, these
new jobs will be in the ﬁeld
of community service or in
the non-proﬁt sector of our
economy.

Some people, however,
cringe at the idea of an ex-
tension of community serv-
ices. These people scream
“socialism.” While is it pos-
sible that such an extension
of community services could
lead to socialism —— I only
wish that it was as certain
as these people say—govern-
ment participation in the
economy per se is not social-
ism. The distinction must, I
think he made. I wiii attempt
to draw this distinction in
my next article which will
be the rst of a series on

’ socialism.

Student Faults
‘News’ Writer

Editor, The Pitt News:

Mr. Allan Schlosser, an out-
spoken adherent to the belief that
problems in our society are com-
plex in nature, has in his arti-
cle, “California Calamity” (The
Pitt News, Nov. 11) reverted to
the elementary attitude he has
so severely criticized.

Stating that “some 60 per cent
of the Negroes interviewed re-
acted favorably to it” (referring
to Proposition 14), Mr. Schlosser
strongly implies that Proposition
14 was aimed at the Negro pop-
ulation of California.

Mr. Schlosser does not take
into account the large Mexican
population in Southern Califor-
nia. The Mexican situation play-
ed a large part in the introduc-
tion of Proposition 14 and could
conceivably be considered the
overriding .issue.

Mr, Schlosser also fails to dis-
tinguish between a right, that
which man derives from the “law
of nature,.” and a privilege, that
which is conferred upon individ
uals by society. ' -

Government in this country has
the function of protecting the
natural rights of “life, liberty,
and property.” (14th .amend-
ment). In legislating the priv-
ilege. of not allowing a property
owner to discriminate, govern-
ment is legislating against the
“natural rights” of property.

' * In making a value judgment, I,

for one, am unalterably opposed
to government legislating a priv-
ilege to one over the rights of

others. Similarly, I am opposed '

to govermnent legislating .a priv-
ilege requiring racial segregation
in these institutions deemed as
private property.

Each time the question of
rights and privileges is raised by
Mr. Schlosser, he has seen fit to
register it as a conﬂict between
the “ultra-conservatives, neo-Mc-
Carthyists, and white suprema- '
cists of the Deep South,” and the
“American liberal who is the
guardian of civil liberties.”

- It is interesting to note that
the true liberals — John Stuart
Mill, John Locke, _ and James
Madison — who formed the prin-
ciples upon which this govern-
ment was founded are being cor-
related by Mr. Schlosser to the

 ‘iul F8 :.90nS¢rYativ9S  and : white ,_

supremacists” of today, This is
indeed giving the white suprema-
cists quite a bit of respectability.

Read thewords of the new ex-
tremists. John Stuart M111 stated
that man obtained “a recogni-
tion of certain immunities, call-
ed political liberties or rights,
which it was to be regarded as
a breach of duty in the rules to
infringe.” .

Extremist number two, John
Locke, said, “The commonwealth
comes by _a power to set down
what punishment shall belong to

, the several transgressions which

they think worthy of it, com-
mitted amongst the members of
that society . . .; and all this for
the preservation of the property
of all the members of that so-
ciety as far as is possible.”

And that greatest of all ex-
tremists, James Madison, stated,
“The diversity in the faculties of
men, from which the rights of
property originate, is not less an
insuperable obstacle to the uni-
formity of interests. The protec-
tion of these faculties is the ﬁrst
.object of government.

“From the protection of dif-
ferent and unequal faculties of
acquiring property, the posses-
sion of different degrees and
kinds of property immediately
results.”

James Madison in stating that
government has the duty to pro-
tect “the unequal faculties of
acquiring property” has commit-
ted, according to Mr. Schlosser
the most unforgiveable sin of
all, and to think that such an
extremist as James Madison was
.a President of the United States.

_ DITTO FOR DOOMED FOOTBALL
WEST POINT — Paul F. Dietzel is another one of those
eastern football coaches who thinks eastern_ football is in-

. ferior to football played elsewhere in this country. He
doesn’t say it in so many words, but that's what he
thinks.

' ,, One‘--reasoi_i the blond.-haired Army coach. gives for
theitveakness "of eastern football is the recruiting stan-
 dards. As’ mentioned__ here several weeks ago, ‘many of
 ’ ‘ the. better football players in the country are ineligible
 for schools with high’ academic standards. “We could. go
into a place like Monongahela, and want as many aS_11
football players there,” Dietzel said, “but we 1ose_n1ne
off them before their records get past the principal’s

0 ice.’’ ‘
After Dietzel knows that there are only two ball-
players he can even consider, all he has to do_ is con-
vince them that they want to go to West Point, and

 

that the military life is the best life. That’s like trying .

to talk a pre-med student into becoming a bricklayer
after being accepted to Johns Hopkins.

,: WHEN DIETZEL COACHED at Louisiana‘State Univer-
 ~ sity, he did not have that problem. If he spoke to 11 foot-
‘ ball players, ‘ten of them would want to go to L.S.U., and
the 11th would be the son of a Notre Dame alumnus. I
don’t mean that it’s easy to recruit for L.S.U., but it’s
as hard to ﬁnd takers for football scholarships down

there as it is to give chocolate to Korean orphans.

In addition to having lowerrecruiting standards,
southern schools, like L.S.U., recruit as many as three
times the number of football players eastern schools,
like Army and Pitt, recruit. Dietzel spoke about his
Army team like it was a piece of onionskin. “We’re
thin,” he said, f‘very thin. _

“Just look at what we had out there today. We
didn’t have the personnel to stop Pittsburgh,” he said.

 it THERE’S MORE TO having a_ winning football team than
depth, but Dietzel considers his paucity of material as his

main problem. “We only have one super-athlete,” he

said, referring to his quarterback Carl Stichweh.
“When Stich calls a play, and looks at the other
members of his backﬁeld, he just doesn’t. have any
friends. He doesn’t have anyone he can. give the ball to
that he can besure will do the job. '
A. We haven’t been healthy all year because of in-
juries. And when you have a squad like ours, you can’t
.,. afford to lose anyone. Panther coach John Michelosen
 . could echo those sentiments. So could Penn State coach
1' Rip Engle and Navy coach Wayne Hardin.

IN ADDITION to the difficulty of getting basic talent, Diet-
zel has a problem with the size of his ballplayers. He admits
that at West Point he could never have the 235 pound
linemen that Ara Parseghian has at Notre Dame.
 #2 Neither can Dietzel recruit the boy who wants to
'1' ~ “ become a professional football player. A boy who is dedi-
cated to football could not possibly consider attending
West Point. Unless, that is, someone changed his mind,
For going to West Point means giving up eight years o".-
life instead of the usual four.

Except in rare instances, giaduates of the cadet
corps must serve in the regular army for four years
immediately after graduation. It we ‘ake about
as much sense for a- would-be Otto Qraha.-. attend the
United States Military Academy, as it would for a pros-
pective truck driver to attend dental school.

STILL, DIETZEL PREFERS coaching at West Point to
' coaching aat L. S. U. “Don’t get me wrong,” he sai-d. .“I like
I it- here. I’m much happier here in the East, and I don't
want to go back.”

 

 

er than coaching L.S.U.’s Tigers? “Coaching is always
hard. It doesn’t matter if you coach at L.S.U., or here,
or anywhere else.”

But Dietzel did admit to there being less talent, in
quantity at least, in the East. “Let’s just say that it
makes coaching more challenging he concluded.”

- It * *
LAST YEAR, AFTER having played a total of 30 games,
Pitt, Army, and Navy had a combined record of 25-5. The
Panthers were 9-1, Navy was 9-1, and Army was 7-3.
This year, after a combined total of 27 games, the com-
bined record of the three teams is 9-15-3. High acad-
demic standards, no redshirting, and relatively small

squads are factors that .must take their toll.

Surprise Starter‘
By BOB SMIZIK

WEST POINT, N. Y. —
Pitt won its ﬁrst‘ game in
ﬁve weeks here Saturday,
but Army coach Paul Dietzel
didn’t want to give them .any
chance to take much pride in
their 24-8 victory.

To be sure, Dietzel came through
with such coachly cliches as “they
just whipped the pants off us,”
and “Pitt has a real ﬁne team,”
but he made ‘it no secret he felt
a sound Army team may have
made the outcome of the game a

think Pitt was ﬁred up,” he said

,with traces of bitterness and as-

tonishment in his voice.

Then he got into his real case.
“We just had, too many people
not playing for us to beat .a team
like Pittsburgh. Our quarterback
(Rollie Stichweh) had to do
everything for us. He just didn’t
have too many friends in the
backﬁeld. Our regular fullback is
out -and our regular wingback is
out.’

Scores Touchdown

Whether the Panthers were
ﬁred up or not is open for de-
bate, but they played the type
of precision football that was
reminiscent of last year’s team.
They moved the ball almost at
will against the Cadets and
wound up with a total offense of
328, compared to 151 for Army.

Fred Mazurek and Barry Mc-
Knight let Eric Crabtree get into
the show thislweek and the jun-
ior halfback came through with
his best game of the season. After
carrying the ball only ﬁve times
against Notre Dame, Crabtree
was given the ball 18 times
against Army and ran for 86
yards. He scored on a two yard
plunge and on a 30-yard pass
from Mazurek. He was voted
Pitt’s outstanding back. I

McKnight ran for 77 yards and

scored the Panther’s ﬁrst touch-

down. Mazurek had a perfect
passing day, six for six, and had
another scoring pass called back.

But it was more than just an
offensive show for the Panthers.
The defense was superb through-
out the game and Army did not

manage to score until the closing
minutes, just after they had been
halted on the one yard line.

The Panthers’ front four of
Brian Generalovich, Phil Dahar,
Jim Jones and surprise starter
Fred Hoaglin made numerous
stops at the line. If they didn’t,
the four linebackers, Marty Schot-
tenheimer, Ray Popp, Jim Flani-
gan and .alternating middle guards
Jim Irwin and Bernie LaQuinta
made the tackle. The middle
guards were dropping on the line
Saturday.

The defensive backs were left
out of the picture. The Panthers
most proliﬁc tackler in recent
weeks, safetyman Tippy Pohl,
had little chance to practice his
specialty against the Cadets.

Besides naming Crabtree the
Panthers’ outstanding back, ‘a
vote of sportswriters tabbed
Schottenheimer as the outstand-
ing lineman and Mike Rosbor-
ough, who caught three passes,
as the outstanding sophomore.

The football players had their
own poll. They gave the game
ball to captain Ray Popp.

Poor Shooting Plagues ‘Team

Bucknell Degrades

By BILL CABIN
Inaccurate shooting

'plagued the soccer team

again as they lost to Buck-
nell Saturday, 4-2. The loss gives
the booters a 4-5 mark and their
fourth consecutive defeat, while
it is only Bucknell’s second win.
“We came a little unglued,”
said coach Leo Bemis. “Often we
didn’t have a man in position
when we, got the ball in. Our ma-
jor fault, however, was that we
just didn’t put the shots in.”
The Panthers outshot Bucknell,
19-12, but as usual ‘their shots
were over, and around the goal
instead of into it. This has been
their habitual fault all season,

because they’ve outshot every op- ,

ponent except Maryland, but
have lost ﬁve games,

“We had enough chances,” said
Bemis, “but we didn’t make them
when we had the chance.” Be-
mis has made similar statements
-after six of the team’s nine
games, constantly pointing to
the team's ability to penetrate
the opponent's defense, and their
inability to have a “strong ﬁn-
ﬁsh.”

Bemis assumed that the play-

ment in practices. His assump-
tion was wrong. “This team
doesn’t have the individual ﬁ-
nesse and skills I thought they
had. They’re not ﬁnished ball
players, and we should have
worked more on basic skills.”

Apathy among several players
has also hindered the booters in
ending their losing streak. After
the loss to Grove City, they lost
their impetus. “Once you start
losing,” said Bemis, “you need a
lot to combat it, and we haven’t
had enough. Several players
haven’t put out enough in the
last ﬁve games.”

The booters conclude the sea-
son Thursday at 2:30 p.m. when
they play Penn State at the Sta-
dium. “They’ve got a. ﬁne team,”
said Bemis, “and they’ll be up for
us.” Penn State has a 4-4 mark
after downing Gettsyburg last
week.

Although both teams are not in
consideration for the NCAA play-
offs, the game means a differ-
ence between a winning and los-
ing season. If the Panthers win,
they will have a 5-5 record, like
last year. ,

By GEORGE LIES

Phi Epsilon Pi routed the
Electrical Engineers, 32-0, to
win the All Campus Football
Championship last Wednesday at
Schenley Oval. Phi Ep outscored
their opponents 136-6, while com-
piling a perfect 7-0 record.

After forcing the Double E’s to
punt on fourth down, Phi Ep
employed a series of short pass-
es by quarterback Rick Rogow to
move to the Engineers’ 28 yard
line. Rogow climaxed the drive,
throwing a screen pass to George
Prussin who ran 30 yards for
the touchdown.

Phi Epsilon Pi, again using
short runs and passes, seized a
two touchdown edge when Prus-
sin caught a Rogow pass for 15
yards. Rogow passed to Tom
Lundy for "the conversion and a
13-0 half time lead.

The Double E’s had the ball four
times within Phi Ep’s 020 yard

Greensburg Student
Frosh Representatives

Two freshman students
have been appointed to rep-
resent the freshman class in

sociation (SGA) at the

Greensburg campus. The two
students — Louis Kleid and
Lynn Erickson — Will work with
for sophomore members of SGA,
William Ford, Mary Ann Ciotti,
Fred Halsted and Chuck Snyder.
The SGA is co-operating with
various community associations
in an effort‘ to initiate a tutorial
service. Mrs. Alice Moore, history
instructor at Greensburg, is work-
ing with representatives from Se-
ton Hill and‘ Saint Vincent Col-
leges in an attempt to co-ordinate
this project. Under the project,
an hour and a half of instruc-
tion will be offered weekly to
junior high students of the area.
This program will conclude the
second week in December and
will be resumed in January.

SGA is sponsoring the second
annual Christmas Dance to be
held in the Crystal Room at the
Penn Albert Hotel on Dec. 22.
The Don Wade Orchestra will
provide the music.

The ﬁrst SGA planned event
of the Fall trimester was Fresh-
men Orientation which included
speeches and a get-«acquainted
picnic. The week of Sept. -9-16

vided funds for the SGA treas-
ury, This money is used through-
out the year to sponsor general

composed of 12 sophomores who
have a minimum QPA of 2.75.
