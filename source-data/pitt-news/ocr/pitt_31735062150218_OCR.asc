First Honors in Carnival Contest

The Early American village, bar-
ricaded in the southeast corner of
Lilly Court last Thursday night, was
the top-paying attraction of Carnival

directed by Ruth McClain, C41, the

the heaviest turnover of the seven
nationality villages and won for its
sponsors the $25 ﬁrst prize in the
Carnival Night competition.

Second in the running was the
Chinese Village, the work of the
YMHA, YMCA, and YWCA, followed
by the English village, “-Sherwood.
Forest,” in third place. Scabbard

Pitt Players collaborated on the lat-

ter.

Student Opinion Favors Crew Racing

Vfhicli way is the wind blowiiigi’

Subsidization:  ever. this subject persists in plaguing those
who direct our educational institutions. For more than a year now,
those who have been determining and those who have been executing
policy at th.is University liave emphasized stringent interpretation of
the regulations designed to curb this “evil. practice."

This stand more than once was justified by the claim that this
was the “trend." It was only last. November, during one of the re-
-curring athletic crises that had been awkwardly blurbcd across the
-country, that we were told: “’l‘hc University's action in the present
-controversy will determine the trend of intercollegiate athletics in
America for the next fifteen years.”

And then again, when the University tied up in the “unofficial"
way with the Big Ten. it. was‘ said that the time was drawing near
when the line would be more tightly drawn between those schools
which subsidize and those which are “honest and fair." No less an
authority than Major Griffith himself said words to this effect in ex-

,plaeining"'tlie‘reason why Pitt and the Big Ten illiltl sometliing in

conimon.

This was all said during the middle of last winter.

Only a month ago, the Major seemed to reverse his ﬁeld coin-
pletely when he come out and said, in effect: “If certain soutliern
scliools don't stop subsidizing so ﬂagrantly, the Big Ten will let down
its bars’?

Recently‘ it‘ was brought to our attention that the VVestern ("on-
ference will inaugurate a one-meal-a—day training table for football
players. This  deﬁnitely out of ste pwith the Code Bowman.

Now, from Ann Arbor comes further indication of the Big Ten
trend. The Student Senate, representing Michigan undergraduate
body, adopted a resolution Tuesday that “subsidization of athletics
be made a regular practice by the University.” The senate unani-
niously adopted a tliree-point‘ plan, which will be presented to the
:athletic board. Its provisions included an extended training table,
covering all three meals during the season. scholarsliip provisions,
and Big Ten Conference standardization of subsidization rules for all
conference schools. Assompanying the report was the statement.’ that

ﬂowers, green grass, college students,
and ﬂies, the warm weather has
brought out Dr. H. C. Carlson’s “re-
verse offense” '

While Mendlow, was _A striking out

Almost every one of the 3587 registered undergraduate students
on the Cathedral campus thinks that the University should sponsor
9 crew racing as a major varsity intercollegiate sport.

' The fact, revealed today in a campus survey by the Student
Opinion Surveys of Anierica. adds substantial backing to the present
cominimity movement. to have the sport established at the three local
schools. James Hagan, University athletic director, has indicated
that‘ student opinion would be his chief guide-post in considering the
sport for Pitt consumption.

In this survey. a carefully selected cross-section of the ‘@6111;
ibody was asked: “Are you in favor of crew-racing at. Pitt?" The
vote of the student body as a whole is:

Yes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .98%
No . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2%

In eﬁ‘_'ect', llniversity students are saying to the sponsors of the
project: “Go right ahead, were right behind you.”

Most interesting to the surveyors, alongside the unanimity of
opinion. was the entlnisiastic reply. The question was generally
greeted with, “Deﬁnitely,” “Absolutely,” “By all means,” and
Hg. , 77 ’

Lille.

Typical of the spirit of this response is that of a senior in the col-

lege. who says, “ \e’d even follow the team up to Poi1glikeepsie.”

_ The comments of students, male and female, in all schools of the
l»niversity, show that there are four main reasons why Pitt students
want to have the sport‘ of Pitt:

1—Belief that the nature ofthe sport would raise the prestige.
of the school. It is considered the “sport of gentlemen,” and
identified with Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard.

2-—’l‘hat as long as we have excellent natural facilities, it would
be foolish not to participate in the sport.

3-—It will open the active ﬁeld of athletics to more students and
will ‘enable _a greater portion of the undergraduate body to
participate in intercollegiate athletics.

4—It will be “fun to watch.”

ford and not enough like Pitt.

Even greater in the unai1i.n1it_v of opinion was the response to
the q_uestion: “VVould you actively support the crew by attending
its home races?” The answer to this was:

Panther-Temple
Game Cancelled
After Rainstorm

A chilling wind and a steady rain
put an early end to the Panthers’
scheduled diamond clash with Tem-
ple last Saturday, so early that bat-
ting practice had barely been com-
pleted before the umpires and the
rival coaches decided to call the
whole thing off. “ D"

The postponement was scarcely

welcome since it meant that there
would be more than a week elapsing
between the Penn State double-head-
er and the next Pitt match, that with
Indiana State Teachers this Saturday.

The layoff has giv‘en "coach Mitter-
ling a chance to overhaul the ﬁelding

‘of his proteges and sharpen up their

batting eyes. Prior to the State bat-
tles, ﬁve regulars were swinging in
or close to the .300 class but after
the two game series, the averages had
plummeted to a feeble level.
Especially serious is the slump en-
tangling Bob Foliart. Belting Bobby
had the second highest average on
the team after the southern trip, but
has run into a slump that came to a
head against State. In two games.
Foliart contributed one home run
with a man on base, rolled out twice,
and fanned four times.

Nick Kliskey is still working on a
rush order, that" of making up a
freshman team by Friday. Practices
began ijust Monday, but Kliskey’s
cherubs have a game with the State
Lion cubs this Saturday at State Col-
lege, probably their only engagement
of the year. '

Linksmen Drop
Three Matches

To Easterners

,Pitt wound up its Eastern Inter-
collegiate«Gclt' Association play last
week-end by dropping three matches.
Georgetown opened the holocaust
with a 7-2 lacing, Princeton followed
up with a whitewash, and Pennsyl-
vania cilimaxed the Panther nosedive
with a 6-3 win.

Despite the feeble attack of the
Pe.nthe1‘s last *..veek-end two names
stand out for their Association play.
They are Tony Kaye, who regained
his to-rin and took Georgetown’s pre-
viously undefeated Burke in the in-
dividual play and had a hand in his
defeat in the best ball match, and
Bill Daddio who ﬁnished his career
with but one defeat. Pitt’s Reilly
pulled a surprise when he took Penn
linl-zsman Stern 1 up.

The only match that the Panthers
were remotely close to winning was
the Penn fracas, during which two
matches went extra holes. Both
were best ball matches, one going
nineteen holes with Pitt on top 1 up
and the other took twenty-two holes,
Penn getting the edge_ 1 up.

Princeton repeated its Mid Atlantic
Division feat by knocking oﬁ all of
its Association rivals to cop the title
a second time.

Theological Text:
Published in M75

In unpacking some old books,
librarians recently found a book
printed in 1475, J. Howard Dice,
University librarian, has reported.

The book is in remarkably good
condition and shows few signs
that would indicate its age. It is
a theological treatise entitled The
Last Judgement and was written
by Alexander de Alis.

Printed entirely in Latin, the
book is somewhat smaller than a
large collegiate dictionary. It fea-
tures illuminating printing. The
value of the book is not known.

An inscription in the front of
