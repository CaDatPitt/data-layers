Correction:

Friday’s story, “SGB candidates might face an easy win,” incorrectly stated the number of signatures someone must get to run for SGB president.
Aspiring candidates must get 500 signatures. Because of an editing error, the article also incorrectly stated the gender of Ali Noorbakash, a male
student running for SGB, and the referendum on which students will vote a Nov. 19. Students will vote on mostly grammatical changes to SGB’s
Constitution. The Pitt News regrets the errors. - ‘

Author discusses history of unruly students, medieval beer bongs

Audience restless for the guest speaker ’s lecture on unruly college students

Lindsay Carroll
Assistant News Editor

It was an ironic Friday evening
for many freshmen who attended
a professor’s lecture on unruly
college students throughout his-
tory. '
University of Oregon history
professor Ian McNeely spoke to

almost 2,000 people on Friday
night at Carnegie Music Hall.
Most of the audience was com-
prised of Pitt freshmen whose
attendance at “Nine Hundred
Years of Unruly Students” was
mandatory because the Ofﬁce
of Freshman Programs required
students taking Introduction to
Arts and Sciences to read Mc-
Neely’s book.

McNeely spoke over constant
chatter from the audience. Some
students waved their cell phones
to spell words, others laughed

loudly orshouted, and more than ,

half of the students rushed out of
the theater immediately after the
lecture, skipping the question-

and-answer ‘session. 
At one point, McNeely paused,
and waited for the freshmen to,"

stop talking, but otherwise ig-

nored what he said might have
i been the unruliest crowd_he had

addressed.

“I felt it would almost be hyp-
ocritical of me for calling them
out on it,” McNeely said after the
lecture. A

The lecture, accompanied by a

PowerPoint slideshow, addressed 0
the changing moral‘ and intel— ._

lectual mission of institutions of
higher learning in the Western
tradition. McNeely discussed
’ universities from medieval times
to the 18th and 19th centuries
and today.
Audience members seemed
surprised by some activities Mc-
Neely described, such as medi-

 eval binge drinking. He showed

few minor setbacks and a second phone call to

Reilly said staff members at the OMET oflice
ﬁxed the problem quickly and that students
should not worry about the machine affecting
their grades.

She also said the problem had nothing to
do with a change in answer sheet format. New
sheets use hexagons instead of circles.

Steve Zumbrum, a-psychology major, said
he heard rumors that machine errors could
negatively affect grades.

“I was deﬁnitely a little apprehensive taking
this test,” Zumbrum said shortly after complet-
ing a midterm Monday. “My professor kept
stressing that if we change an answer, we have
to make sure to erase it completely. A few times,

and lower my score.”

In spite of concerns like this, Reilly said she
did not thinkthe machine problems could nega-
tively affect students’ grades. .

“Our machines are as accurate as they can
possibly be,” she said. “Of course, no machine
is 100 percent accurate, so it‘s always up to the
instructor and the student to make sure tests
are graded properly.” V j _

She said the OMET ofﬁce notiﬁed all instruc-
tors who scanned their tests with the new ma-
chine to recheck their reports to see if it affected
any students’ exams.

On the grading report given to instructors,
a pound sign shows up for any question the
machine reads as double-marked. ,

The pound sign, Reilly said, should let the in-

~ structorknowthatanyanswerdouble-marked

is not necessarily wrong, but rather that the ma-
chine had a problem grading that question.
“If we ever come across a problem, we leave
it up to the professor and the student to make a
human judgment,” Reilly said. “A machine can’t
do that. A machine is just a machine.”
The OMET office sent a letter to various

deans in the academic community, explaining ,
I and apologizingfor arecent delay inthe ofﬁce’s

ability to return tests quickly. A

The office is usually able to return tests the
next day, but two weeks ago, it was only able to
process tests in 48 hours.

Reilly said an inﬂux of midterm tests, not
problems with the scanning machine, caused
the delay. '

Pitt psychology professorAllanZuckoff said
he heard about the potential problems with
the new machines in late September, after he
had given his ﬁrst exam. When he ‘received his
students’ grades for that exam, he said he no-
ticed something strange about the number of
questions recorded as double—marked.

“Because OMET provides us with raw data,
where you can actually look at exactly which

- questions individual students got wrong, I

was able to see there were an unusual number
of questions where students had apparently
marked two answers,” Zuckoff said.

Zuckoff did not have much trouble ﬁx-

ing the problem, though, and said he did not‘

think it could have lowered any ofhis suidents’
scores. '

“It was only a minor inconvenience having
to go back through the tests,” he said. “If I had
not had all the raw data OMET gives back to
instructors andl actually had to go back through

, the Scantronsheets,itwould havebeenanenor—

mous amount ofwork. The way OMET provides
instructors with the raw data made it easy.”

Zuckoff said his job would be much harder
without the services OMET provides.

“This is my ﬁrst semester teaching full-time
in the psychology department,” he said. “I can‘t
imagine having to grade my tests by hand. I
have over 350 students in my Introduction to
Psychology class. If I were to grade by hand, I
would probably need four, ﬁve, a half—dozen
TAS.”

Editorial , p
Don’t |etSGB election

go gentle into the night

' year’s SGB election could be
one forthe historybooks —but
may not be the most memora-

ble.. So far, current SGB board mem-
ber Charlie Shull is the only candidate
running for president — a situation
that hasn’t happened on Pitt’s campus
since 1992, SGB adviserjoyce Giangarlo
said. '

And what about those eightvacan—
cies for board members? Well, there
are exactly eight students runningfor
board member positions. It appears
that Pitt studentswillhave to leave their
trust — and, as a portion of every stu-
dent’s semesterly fees goes toward the
SGB regulated student activities fee,
their money — with these nine indi-
viduals.

On part of the election system and
Pitt’s studentbody, however, it’s too bad
that only the minimum of candidates
plan on rtmning. Current SGB board
member Nila Devanath told The Pitt
News that she suspects the low can-
didate rate is a result of the heavy
criticisms SGB members constantly
face, which assuredly is a signiﬁcant
deterrent.

Most recently, in the aftemiath of
the chaotic G-20 Summit, SGB dealt
with student criticism in its handling
ofworkingwith studentswho said they
were wrongly arrested. Historically,
The Pitt News has been vocal when it
comesto condemning SGB’s actions, or
inmany cases, inaction, andwe recently
wrote an editorial criticizing SGB’s re-
sponse in dealing with G-20 Summit
arrestees. There’s no doubt about it,
potential SGB members had better be
ready for some heat. Atthe same time,
we never hesitate to commend mem-
bers ofthePittcommunitywhenwefeel

they deserve some public recognition.
For example, we also ran an editorial
discussing how the Pitt police stepped
up duringthe chaos of the G-20.

While a reasonable deterrent,
criticism helps to circulate prevalent
issues within the student body. The

‘ candidates’ platforms bring attention
to avarietyof ISSUES atPittfromthe op-
eration of SafeRider, to the workings of
our dining services, to the ﬁmctioning
of student groups. Part of SGB’s job ‘is

‘ to instigate change within the Univer-
sity, and, through criticism, it’s able to
recognize and shape those changes.
Ifstudents and organizations didn’t
raise concerns, there’d be no measure
to ensure issues — whether part of a
members platform or not — receive
adequate attention.

Politicians face scathingfeedbackin

theirprofessions every day, and campus
politics should be no different. And,
as all of the SGB members are leaders
among the student body, part ofbeing
a leader is learning to face, cope and
learn from criticism.

SGB handles asigniﬁcantarnountof
student money,and theyfre not getting
much coverage from the Post— Gazette
these days. So ifThe Pitt News doesn’t
hold it accountable, who will‘?

Students can still ﬁle to run for an
SGB position until Nov. 11. Pitt never
ﬂaunts high numbers when it comes
to voter turnout for SGB elections,
with about 4,000 students voting in
last year’s election. We hope that more
students will plan to run, as an already
overtly apathetic student body should
have more reason to vote — and in-
variably attune themselvesto issues on
campus — ifthere are more than just
shoe-in candidates on the ballots. A

Malt liquor is a type of beer,

Malt liquor comes from real

The4O is the drink of real men slu

Today's difﬁculty level: Very Easy

a rule.

Sometimes, malt liquor comes in 16-,

ounce cans l— heavy enough with which

to exercise. It’s the biggest size of cans in "

the world. _ _
Other times, malt liquor comes in titanic
40—ounce bottle drums, if you will. This

is three and a half times a normal beer '

bottle, for a consumer who is three and a
half times the man. Also, because there’s

, 50 percent more alcohol, the 40 packs the

punch of ﬁve or six beers.
A 40 is so big that you keep the 40 in

the paper bag in which it’s sold, so you can
hold on better. But the paper bag is not just.

a necessity —— it engenders mystique.
Wine also comes in big bottles, but no

one walks around with a bottle of wine in -
a paper bag.

Even drinking wine straight from the
bottle feels weird. You’d want to pour it in

a glass no matter how cheap the wine is. '

On the other hand, a paper bag is the
4o’s natural gown. It’s naked without the
paper bag, and if you go so far as to peel the
label off  well, that’s just pornographic.

Meanwhile, it is a historical .fact that
malt liquor has never been poured into
a glass. Go ahead and say it: “I’ll have a
tall glass of Four 0 Malt Liquor, please.”

‘ It sticks in the throat. -_ '

Now, when you roll up to the party with A

the 40 in hand, literally every dude will
gape and nod at the 40. It’s like you walked
in with a falcon on your shoulder. They’ll
say, “What up? Rockin’ the 40 ounce!”
Through all smiles, these dudes fear the
40, for it" is grand and linked to rappers

A of ﬁerce renown — awesome men who

replenish their ﬂuids with little else.

, Others at the ‘party will have good beers,
which everyone calls “brews,” because
these are the only types of beer that are

brewed. .

They have names like, “Sand Bag Sum-
mer-in-a-Leap -Year Chrysanthemum Ale.”
The problem with brews is that people
constantly ask to take a sip and steal them
from,the fridge. Mononucleosis and heist
are the brew’s constant company.

In contrast, once you start on your 40,
no one asks to take a sip. The reason is
partly that the specter of backwash is too
glaring, but mainly the signature taste
of malt liquor sears the dainty palates of
lesser men. Everyone who can handlethe
40 already has one.

Another peril of beers is that you must _

be careful for what you wish. Some beers

are made especially for dandy ladymen-

Sipping on the wrong beverage can get you
banned from the armed forces.

Not so for 40s.

As long as you clutch a fo—dog of any
make at all, you can traipse — nay,'.skip —
merrilythrough a Klan meeting in a “Sexy
She-Devil Costume” and evoke naught but
the deepest awe i-n your fellows. '

There is simply no “ladyman” major
at 40 Ounce University, no direct ﬂights
to Ladyman International Airport on 40
Ounce Airways, no hit single from The
Ladymen on the Top 40 Ounce Countdown.
That’s because, while brewing malt liquor
to strength depends on copious amounts of

sugar, spice and everything nice are kept ‘

at great distance ,— replaced instead by
lion piss and everything needlessly ag-
gressive. * _ A q A

The most important thing you can learn
about 4os,’though, is to drink responsibly.
With just one 40, you’re already drink-
ing like a man. There’s'no need to die like
one. - »

Taking Back Sunday revamps music

8 p.m.

Veteran Brooklyn rock band“

_'Taking Back Sunday is back with
. a new album, a new guitarist and

a new outlook on its music. _
Taking Back Sunday’s Matt
Rubano, who plays bass and lends

‘ his vocals to the band, explained

how his band’s music has evolved
since the release of its last album
and how the most recent lineup
change has affected its music.
“With each record we’ve done,
we have wanted to take "a step
forward and have always wanted
to grow and develop the sound of

the band. On ‘New Again,’ it was
really important for us to really
feel like we were redeﬁning what
it means to sound like Taking
“Back Sunday,” Rubano said.

The departure of lead gui-
tarist and backup vocalist Fred
Mascherino led to Matt Fazzi
joining the band as Mascherino’s
replacement, also pushing the
group to reinvent itself.

“Matt Fazzi joined the band
and brought with him a very
open—minded and fearless kind
of approach to writing music.

“That sort of spread to every-
one else, and we were all vibing
off of [the approach] in the re-
hearsal space,” he said.

Rubano claimed that there
isn’t much you can do to prepare

' in the event of members rotat-
ing in and out of the band except
hope that the new members will
fit organically into the band and

take its music to a new level.
“It’s not the kind of thing you
prepare for or anticipate, and you

just deal with it the same way you _

do when your boyfriend breaks
up with youdut of the blue. You
just kind of go, ‘Oh well, that
didn’t work,’ and you keep go-
ing,” he said.

Rubano said that the symbol-
ism for the title of Taking Back
Sunday’s fourth studio album,
New Again, is both personal and
musical.

“We were enjoying what we
were doing. We just used our raw

instincts to move forward, and as‘

a result it was a really fun record
to make, and it felt like we had

a little bit of an energy rebirth

while we were working on it.”
One of the deciding factors
that distinguished New Again
from the band’s prior records
was its source of inspiration.

Tybout: Grand plans forthe

Andy Tybout
Columnist

Last Monday, my ﬁnancially inclined
friends brought me anexcitingpiece
of news: The rights to the “Termina—'
tor” franchise are up for sale.

Being the die-hard “Terminator”
fanatic I am — it’s my third-favorite
James Cameron movie —— I jumped
at the opportunity, and I’m pleased

to armounce my bid for the rights.

Now, the company selling these
rights might be skeptical of an un-
known like me — and perhaps
rightly so. A quick evaluation of
my Panther Funds will reveal I’m
not the millionaire mogul some of
the bidders are.

‘ But what I lack in monetary
wealth, I make up for in cinematic
prowess. ‘

My ideas for the series are as
subversive and ingenious as Sky-
net. Like Joss Whedon, “Buffy the
Vampire Slayer” creator and fel-

low bidder, I believe such story-
blending sequels as “Terminator
of the Rings” would serve to widen
the franchise’s appeal andthicken
our wallets. -
But I propose something even

I more radical: a new story arc. Don’t

worry, “Terminator” fans, I’ve go
this one covered. , —

“Terminator 5”: After realizing
the horrors of dystopian war, the
cyborgs and the humans attempt
to craft a treaty, but special inter-
est groups threaten to undermine
it with legal loopholes.

“Terminator 6”: The treaty fails,
leading to another war of epic bat-
tles, romance and vehicular homi-
cide. If we’re still tight on budget,
we can just splice in stock footage
from previous ﬁlms.

“Terminator 7”: More of the
same. We’ll end this one on a cliff-
hanger to give the illusion of narra-
tive progress. V 7

“Terminator ’ 8”: Arnold
Schwarzenegger goes back in time

to try to save theifailed experiment
that is California. Instead of sav-
ing it, though, he just sits around
saying stuff like, “I think that gay

-marriage should be between a man

and awoman.” The state — and the

There is no ?Terrninator
15,’ the crew decides,
because the series died
long ago.

movie franchise — gets worse.
“Terminator 9”: An epic, “This-
might-really-be—the-last-movie”

' movie, wherein ﬁnal battles are ‘

fought, memorable catch phrases
are exchanged, and overbearing
choirs sing songs in a minor key.

(Cm

, in the halls’ of power.

‘Terminator’ series

“Terminator 10”: In the same
vein as “Indiana Jones” and “Pi-
rates of the Caribbean,” it turns
out this isn’t the last movie. One of
the T-800s has survived the human
“victory.”

“Terminator 11”: Another Terrni—
nator goes back in time to stop the
original Terminator from running
for governor. Intense “Which one
should I shoot?” sequences ensue

“Terminator 12”: The T—8oo that
survived dies.

“Terminator 13”: Schwarzeneg-
ger backs George W. Bush during the

2004 campaign, thereby ensuring V

a human apocalypse.

“Terminator 14”: Upon ﬁnding
that the—set’s brunch menu doesn’t
include the nutritionally superior
“wheat bread,” Christian Bale
erupts, declaring that he’s “done,

professionally.” As the cast and
" crew watch Bale storm off the set,
they silently reminisce on the days
when they didn’t have to deal with

his Batman bullsh*t.

“Terminator 15”: There is no
“Terminator 15,” the crew decides,
because the series died long ago.
“Terminator 3” was kind of good ——
not “Judgment Day” good, of course,

but good enough to end the series. ,

Instead, the crew realizes it’s been a
steady downhill slope, what with the
loss of the main actor, the increased
reliance on spectacle over thought
and the general narrative quagmire
of having a deﬁnite ending planned
out since the ﬁrst movie. I sell the
movie rights, now worth about
as much as a 1992 Buick, to Tyler
Perry. “Terminator 15” becomes a
heartwarming comedy about the
real meaning of family.

Anyway, that’s the trajectory I

foresee, should my bid be accepted. :
‘As I tell my ﬁnancial team, I can’t

promise a budget surplus, but I can
promise a fun surplus.

. Also, as a side note, the produc- -

ers should know that I can only pay
in Dining Dollars.

Christmas doesn’t come early in Dickens update

“A Christmas Carol” packs stunning visuals, but leaves audiences Scrooged with muddled messages

Patrick Wagner
For The Pitt News

“A Christmas Carol” ~
Starring: Jim Carrey, Gary Oldman
Directed By: Robert Ze-meckis
Studio: Walt Disney Pictures
Grade: C-

Christmas movies might be the most
exploited of all exploitation ﬁlms. Taking
one of the world’s most beloved holidays
and trying to create a touching cinematic

~_ experience often results in a less-than—de-

sirable product. This is not a rule though,
and, infrequently, a good "holiday ﬁlm is
possible. Disney, usually the first to bring
family-friendly fare to the masses, is start-
ing this holiday season with the third ad-
aptation of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas
Carol” that it has released in the past 30
years, and sadly, it’s not the classic that
many were hoping for.

Directed by Robert Zemeckis (“Back
to the Future,” “Beowulf ”) and using the
“performance capture” technique he pio-
neered in “The Polar Express,” the age-old
Dickens classic tells the familiar story of

heartless moneylender Ebenezer Scrooge,
who learns, through visits from three
spirits, the true essence of the Christmas
season and kindness toward his fellow
man. 1

Jim Carrey —— who portrays Scrooge
and the ghosts of Christmas past, present
and future — is joined by Gary Oldman,
Colin Firth and several other Hollywood
regulars who bring both their vocal and
corporeal movements to the screen. Ze-
meckis’ technique is something of an
acquired taste, but here it really shim-
mers. The ﬁlm is visually ravishing. With
a generous and apt use of 3-D technology,
in addition to some captivating cinema-
tography, “Carol” brings early Victorian
London to stunning animated life. In the
opening scene, Scrooge travels by jovial
children, street shoppers and people
generally bustling about the snow—laden
streets and tall dark houses to get to his
accounting house. Throughout the scene,
the 3-D technology creates a layered View
and allows the moviegoer to experience a
house in the background, a person in the
foreground and an arm that seemingly
pokes into the people in front of you — all

“On New Again in particular, songs re-
ally came from every way imaginable, and
some of the seeds for what these songs be-
came were planted years ago. Some [were
inspired] while jamming in the back of the
bus,” he said.

The three-year gap since the band’s last
album, Louder Now, allowed the band to
come into its own and gave it the opportu-
nity to focus on the music it were inspired
to make rather than feeling the pressureto
rise to other people’s expectations.

“All of the inﬂuences and opinions and
little tiny voices — if you really know what
you’re doing, they don’t mean anything
because most of those opinions aren’t
weighted in anything that matters to mu-
sic. Most of those opinions are business-
related,” Rubano said. '

_The bassist explained that two of the
three years in between Louder Now and
New Again were spent touring.

The last year was spent working on

Adam Littman

After a dominating 37-10 win against

teamis rankedinthe top 10 for the ﬁrst
time since 1982.

The Panthersareranked No. 8 inthe
Associated Press poll and No. 9 in the

No. 12 inthe Bowl Championship Series
poll, which is Pitt’s highest ranking in
that poll since it was created in 1998.

In1982, the Panthers were the pre-
season No. 1, but quickly fell to No. 2
the third week of the season behind
Washington even though the Panthers
hadn’t lost yet. Pitt reclaimed the top
spot on Oct. 25, thanksto a6-0 record.

Senior Staﬁ Writer

' The Pitt men’s basketball team held.

Coker College to just six ﬁrst-half
points as the Panthers rolled to an
83-40 victory yesterday to conclude
their exhibition season. ,

While it did hit two free throws,
Cokerdidn’t make ashotfrom the ﬂoor
until3:55 remained inthe ﬁrsthalf. By
then Pitt already built up a 32-4 lead.

Pitt coachjamie Dixon said he saw
developmentinhis team after issuing
a challenge of Sunday—to—Sunday im-
provement after lastweek’s 75-,64exhi-_
bition victory over Slippery Rock.

“We moved the ball better today,”
Dixon said. “We stressed penetration
to kick—out instead of forcing drives
and playingin crowds. Ithinkthatwas
our biggest adjustment.”

The Panthers shot nearly 55 per-
cent from the ﬂoor for the game to
Coker’s 30.8 percent.

Despite the score discrepancy
during the game, point guard Travon
Woodall said the Panthers remained
focused on their effectiveness.

“We aren’t really looking at the
score,” Woodall said. “These games
help us to prepare for the season, so
we’re focused on offensive and defen-
sive execution.”

Woodall led the Panthers with
21 points and three assists, shooting
.8—of-10 fromthe ﬁeld and 3-of—5 from
beyond the arc.

Among the highlights from his
performance was a combination fast

Despite his offensive success,
Woodallsaid he wished he accumu-

“I’ve been talking to Levance

to me,” Woodall said. “It’s kind of like
how Brandin [Knight] was to him. I’ve
worked hard all summer, so hopefully
it pays 0 .”

Gary McGhee was the only other
Pitt player to reach double figures with
13 points on 4-of-5 shootingand 5-of-.8

There are no more mouse traps
left on Pitt’s schedule. After
overcoming a -slow start, the
Panthers rolled over Syracuse
in the second half on their way
to a 37-10 victory Saturday at
Heinz Field.

Trap game? It certainly ap-
peared that way as Pitt nursed
a 6-3 lead late in the second
quarter.

However, a stellar defensive
play by linebacker Greg Williams
seized momentum and relieved
Pitt from its malaise.

Williams intercepted a pass
from Syracuse quarterback Greg
Paulus and returned it 51 yards
for a touchdown with 1:20 left in

“ the first half.

Jumpstarted by the turnover,

the Panthers (8-1, 5-0 Big East) .

outscored the ‘Orange 24-7 in the
second half to en route a com-
fortable victory.

Pitt coach Dave, Wannstedt

was well aware of the possible
pitfalls when playing .a lesser
conference opponent with much
more difficult games on the ho-
rizon, especially after handily
beating South Florida 41-14 two
weeks ago.
“When you have a week off and
you win the way we won against

Plenty of NHLshocks  

Through the season’s frrst month, a lot seems upside—do.wn

Greg Trietley
Staﬁ Writer

I think I’ve been holding my newspaper up-
side—down.

Most people at the start of the season ex-
pected the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washing-
ton Capitals to sit near the top of the confer-
ence, but nobody expected Colorado to pace
the West and Detroit to falter.

Let’s take a look at a few of hockey’s sur-
prise teams — both good and bad —— this

' year.

Colorado Avalanche

The Avalanche entered Sunday tied with
San Jose for ﬁrst place in the conference, an
unexpected start for a team that ﬁnished last
by 10 points, just a year ago. ~

With career backup Craig Anderson in goal,
most publications picked Colorado to miss the

_ playoffs. But Anderson now sits near the top of

the league with a .934 save percentage. _
The retirement ofjoe Sakic injuly left the
team without any recognizable stars on of-

fense. Two months into the season, though, '

rookie center Ryan O’Reilly has 14 points in
17 games, and ninth-round draft pick David
Jones has ﬁve goals.

In the end, though, Colorado is a pretender

—. Anderson, having never played more than A

31 games in a season, will fall back to Earth.
Anderson played like this last November and

_ stole the starting j ob in Florida only to give it

back up shortly thereafter.
New York Islanders '

The Islanders make about six moves every
olfseason that you’re allowed to chuckle at.
This summer, with goaltender Rick DiPietro
already under contract for 12 more years,
they signed both Martin Biron and Dwayne
Roloson. They inked Mark Streit last summer,
a high-scoring defenseman who most people
saw as a liability in his own zone.

New York is getting the last laugh. Streit
plays about 25 minutes a night against op-
ponents’ top lines, and Biron and Roloson

are carrying the load in goal while DiPietro

nurses a bad knee. 1 ‘ ,

Add in ﬁrst overall draft pick-John Tava—
res’ 13 points, and the Islanders are fun to
watch. Don’t be surprised if they sneak into
the playoffs. R

Buffalo Sabres

If you’re' looking for the league’s top de-
fense, you probably wouldn’t look to upstate
New York where the Buffalo Sabres usually
run an ofl'ense-ﬁljst, defense-when-necessary

. style. ' 

But before recent losses to Philadelphia
and Boston,ithe Sabres averaged two goals
against per game. Rookie defensemanlTylerg

Myers, standing at 6-foot-8, hears a Zdeno
Chara comparison once a week.

Still, the Sabres won’t go far this season.
Goaltender Ryan Miller plays almost every
game. Without a capable backup — former
Penguin Patrick Lalime sees the ice once a
month —— Miller will tire in the spring, when
he will play for Team USA in the Olympics in
addition to his workload with Buffalo.

Boston Bruins

I.
J

The Bruins won the East last year, but the
salary cap compelled them to trade away
36-goal scorer Phil Kessel, and the team has
struggled to score this season.

Don’t think Boston won’t: contend this year,
though. Injuries are to blame for its current
7-7-2 record. Milan Lucic, the hardest hitter in
the league, hasn’t played since Oct. 16 because
of a broken ﬁnger, which he probably suffered
while wrestling abear. Top center Marc Savard
has a broken‘ left foot, and David Krejci has
the H1N1 virus. '

Once these players return, the Bruins will
climb back up the Eastern Conference stand-
1ngs.\

Phoenix Coyotes ‘

With all the ‘relocation talk, it might shock
you to hear that Coyotes still play hockey. It

might shock you even more to hear that ‘the ‘

Coyotes play hockey well.
The Coyotes sit sixth in the West with 20
points entering Sunday’S games. Starting goal-

_ tender Ilya.Bryzgalov leads the league with

three shutouts.

The Coyotes’ roster looks like a “Where are
they now?” list, with veterans Robert Lang,
Adrian Aucoin and Edjovanovski all contribut-
ing. I owe a cookie to whoever thought Vernon
Fiddler would have eight points already this
season. -I I

If the franchise’s money problems ever

. sort themselves out, the Coyotes could have

a nice little future in Phoenix or whereve
they end up. '

The Central Division
The Central Division is a Twilight Zone-

esque journey into the unexplainable. Brian
Rafalski and Nicklas Lidstrom are two of the

top 10 defensemen in the game, yet Detroit»

can’t stop opponents from lighting up Chris
Osgood. The losing team in the Finals usually
falters at the start of the following year, an
the Red Wings are no exception. ‘ ‘
Meanwhile, Calder Trophy-winning goal-
tender Steve Mason has given up four or more
goals in six of his 13 starts thislyear, but his
Columbus Bluejackets still lead the division.

St. Louis ﬁnished last season on a several ,

month-long hot streak, but the Blues arejust
5~6—3 this year.

is not going to inﬂuence me.”’

With Syracuse out of the way, Pitt
shouldn’t have trouble focusing on its next
three opponents. The Panthers will con-
clude the season with three huge match-
ups: Notre Dame, at West Virginia and No.
5 Cincinnati. 1

If the Panthers want to take the next
step as a football program, as Wannstedt
has said since becoming coach, they need
to rise to the occasion in’the upcoming
weeks.

These three marquee games are a ba-
rometer for the progress Wannstedt has
made in his ﬁfth year.

The Panthers are actually a second—half
collapse away from being undefeated and
in the national title picture.

However, the Panthers blew a third-
quarter 31-17 lead, getting out—scored 38-31

to close out the game. ‘
Pitt will need three 60-minute perfor-

mances to achieve greatness, because there

are no breathers during the stretch run.

A The infamous concept of the next level
I that critics of Wannstedt have lampooned

appears to be within striking distance.
Perhaps the most notable part of Satur-

day’s game was that Pitt avoided a loss that *  >

jaded fans would consider typical. '

Losing to a less talented team wouldn’t‘
exactly be ‘uncharted territory. 1

Just last season, the then—No. 25 Pan-
thers lost to Bowling Green to open the
season, and, after ﬁnally re-joining the
rankings at No. 17 later in the year, lost
54-34 to a 2-5 Rutgers team.

Yet, this team has done a lot to prove
that it isn’t the same old Pitt team. So the
question remains: what kind of team is
this? .

Well, the stage is set to discover that
answer. There are no more mouse traps

left on Pitt’s schedule —— there are only

titanic conﬂicts.

Basketball 4 11

turnovers.

The ﬁrst halfsealed the game for the Pan-
thers, as.Coker shot 12.5percent from the ﬂoor,
including o—of-5 from beyond the arc.

Coker’s 16 shot attempts in the ﬁrsthalfto—

' taled fewer than Pitt’s 17 made baskets as the V

Panthers went into the break with a 41-6 lead.
“If we learn something, then it was a good

experience,” Coker coach Dan Schmotzer said.

“We’ve played alot of D -1 teams, butwe’ve never
played one of this caliber. We’re grateful for the
experience.” -

Schmotzer said the Panthers’ depth and

Robinson dislocates finger but should play Friday

quickness in the postwas too much forhis team
to handle. He noticed improvement in Woodall
and McGhee from last year, and said Taylor, Pitt’s
McDonald’s All—American freshman, has the
potential tobe special. V

One of the few statistical categories that
remained close was rebounds, with Pitt only
out-rebounding the Cobras 38-32. Dixon said
thatwas a concern and wants to see rebounding
improvement from the Panthers’ frontcourt.

Another negative for Pitt was when power
forward NasirRobinsonleftthe game with13:46
remaining in'the_ ﬁrst halfand didn’treu1rn. Dix-

on said the starter dislocated eitherthe middle

or ringﬁnger onhisleft hand but shouldbeable"

to play in Pitt’s season opener on Friday.
Dwight Miller, who led the Panthers with

V eight rebounds, started the second halfin place

of Robinson. «
The Panthers open up their season Friday
against Wofford at the Petersen Events Center)

V at 8:10 p.m. If the team continues at its current

pace, it expects to be even better by then.

“The team is improving everyday,” Woodall
said. “We are staying together and helping each
other out.”
