Affirmative action still
an issue for Pitt blacks

By Jim Tezak
Asst. News Editor

Recent United States Supreme
Court decisions have “put a halt
on affirmative action,” according
to Terry Tinen, chairwoman of
the Black Action Society.

“I think that it’s because most
people think that ‘innocent
whites’ are no longer preferred
[by potential employers] over
blacks,” Tinen said.

According to T men, the
Supreme Court’s recent decisions
are a complete reversal of the
court’s earlier stands for
affirmative action. As recently as
1987, the Supreme Court upheld
an affirmative action case from
Alabama.

Tinen feels that there is still a
need for affirmative action,
despite the rulings by the Supreme
Court.

’ “I think affirmative action is not

,a racial preference to ethnic

groups that are being
discriminated against. I think it is

a quota that has to remedy

discrimination against ethnic
groups in the work force in
mainstream America. Affirmative
action is not for the promotion of

blacks, but of qualiﬁed blacks,”
Tinen said.

Although the University still
has an Office of Affirmative
Action, the Student Government
Board no longer has , an
Affirmative Action Committee.
That committee was dissolved
early last year, according to Gil
Borok, who has been active in
Pitt’s student government over
the last few years and is presently
the chairman of the SGB
Allocations Committee.

Borok said that the SGB voted
to dissolve the committee because
“it wasn’t receiving any
complaints" and “it was not
fulfilling the purpose it was
designed for.”

Despitethe dissolution of the
Affirmative Action Committee,
Tinen said that the BAS still has

. an SGB liaison and that the SGB

and BAS still work well together.
“There is still a rapport. I don’t
think we’ve suffered at all from
not having the Affirmative Action
Committee,” Tinen said.

Officials from the Office of
Affirmative Action had no
comment on the Supreme Court
rulings at press time.

PPC makes plans for
year of diverse activities

By Suzanne Sabol
Staff Writer

The Pitt Program Council has a
year of activities planned that
will broaden your mind, whittle
your waistline and expand your
horizons.

The Pitt Program Council will
continue to sponsor programs
that appeal to a wide range of
students, according to PPC
student coordinator Melinda
Holben.

As a reflection of this
philosophy, one of the first events
the PPC has planned‘ for this year
is an event called “Celebrate
Diversity.” The week-long event
will include food, dance, films,
music, cultural experiences and
sports frornfaround the world.

“This isaa very exciting event. .

We hope‘ it will get bigger and
bigger every: year,” said Holben.

The next major events planned
center around Homecoming,
which is early this year, on Oct.
14. The PPC is trying a new
format after many activities were
cancelled last year because of
» in.

“It was painful for Homecoming
to be cancelled last year. It was

devastating to me,” said Holben,
who was Homecoming
chairwoman last year.

“lThis year], we trashed the
parade,” Holben said, “and went
with a Mardi Gras night instead.”

The Mardi Gras will include
casino—style gambling and a live
band after the game. There will
also be fireworks Friday night,
weather permitting. '

“A lot of [other] committees
needed to be revamped this year,”
Holben said.

For example, the Leisure
Learning committee is offering
more types of aerobics classes
this year, at more convenient
times. There is also a self-defense
“street smarts" class being offered.

Also. available this year will be
the “finals survival workshops,”
which were very popular and‘
successful-last year, according to
Holben.

The Coffeehouse committee
will also be changing format
because of declining attendance
last year. This committee
sponsored the bands which
played in the Student Union on
Friday nights.

“We’ll try to change it to

Master of the martial arts...

Pitt instructor honored for 5/etlls

By Adam W. Richter
Staff Writer

Master Kyuha Kim is the martial
arts man of the year.

The National Federation of
Martial Arts bestowed this honor
on the Pitt physical education
instructor and inducted him into
its Hall of Fame. Kim, also the
1980 NCAA coach of the year,
teaches judo, tae kwan do, and
self-defense;

Induction was based on his
performance in the art as well as
that of his students. He has sent
students on‘ to win the Junior
Olympics, the NCAA Judo
championship, and other
international tournaments.

Kim explained that tae kwan

do is becoming increasingly
popular with the world
community andas well as among

Pitt students. He explained that '

tae kwan do is perhaps the easiest
to learn and is effectiveas a self-
defense technique.

“Tae kwan do is more popular
now than any other martial sport,”
he said. The sport was accepted
on the exhibition level at the

L 1988 Summer Olympics.

“Pitt students seem to
appreciate the self-defense aspect
of the program," he added.

Despite the increasing
popularity of tae kwan do, Kim
said that its recognition as a sport
among athletic federations is
recent. It was recognized in the
United States by the Amateur

Athletic Union in 1974, 10 years
after South Korea had done so.
Kim said that enthusiasm among
younger practitioners of i the
martial arts has helped the sport‘s
overall popularity. 

Kim was inducted to the Hall of
Fame on Aug. 9 in Cleveland
with Dorothy Nicholas, a former
student of his who was named
female judo instructor of the year.
Nicholas.has taught under Kim
for the past 10 years at Kim's-
Martial Arts and Fitness.

In addition to Kim and Nicholas,
Richard‘ Nicholas, from Kim’s
martial arts school, was inducted
into the Hall of Fame and named
male judo player of the year.

Murder capital’ didn't live up to negative expectations

4 By Jessica Coville

Asst. Managing Editor

It doesn’t matter how many
times I go to Washington D.C. to
visit my mom, as soon as I see
those marble monuments that
have been permanently etched
in my memory since I was a child,
I get this intense feeling of pride,
because: I’m in the nation’s
capital!

However, lately there have
been a. lot of little nasties being

‘said about the place where

important political jobs in the
United States. If you haven’t heard
the rumors and rhetoric, basically
“the capital of democracy” has
turned into a Biblical “den of
thieves.”

As my roommate and I were
driving to Washington, D.C. for
Labor Day, many things I had
recently seen in the papers and
on television ran through my
mind.

The media has dubbed D.C. as
the “Murder Capital of the World”
because there are more murders
committed there every day than
in any other city in the world.

(SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1989, 12:10 PM

(Previously, Detroit held thi;
dubious honor.) Most of these
murders are drug-related.

If this blast of good news wasn't
enough about our capital, it was
recently exposed that there is a

 

Columbian drug cartel (those
people who are causing our
legislature a lot of headaches
these days) and the drug lords of

Washington, D.C.

P Thisweek The Washington Post
ran a series on who and what was
involved in this bi—continental
drug ring, enumerating names of
people who are largely
responsible for most of the
cocaine that comes into the United
States. It is pretty easy to surmise
then, why Washington, D.C. has
become the murder capital.

If that’s not enough for you to
consider an alarm system for your

home, there are the rumors of ‘

Washington’s mayor, Marion
Barry, also being linked to various
drug dealers in the city. This is

because certain friends of his
happen to be known dealers.

All of this in mind as we cruised
down the turnpike, I began to
consider which serni—automatic
weapon (foreign or domestic?) to
carry as I ran into my mother’s
new home.

Is this the mind of a paranoid
working overtime? One who’s
seen too much Geraldo and can
repeat Oprah’s philosophy by
rote? No, I hope not.

I decided then to turn to the
people who would know the city
best, not to those cheesy television
commentators, but the ones who
actually lived there.

My friend Rusty gave me the
best survival tip of all for living in
D.C., “A1l you’ve got to do is act
crazier than the other guy,” he
said as he demonstrated this to a
passenger in the car next to us by
screaming, “What the @i#* are
you looking at?” The other person
looked a bit taken back by this
outburst and just turned away.
“See what I mean?” he said
laughing. T 8

So our Pittsburgh Labor Day
entourage finally made it to hell
town and the first thing I saw was
this old man walking his poodle.
Not quite the terrifying visage I
was expecting to see after playing
this horror movie in my mind.

I watched this guy meander
down the street, apparently not
too concerned about walking his
dog on the streets of the murder
capital of the world.

-Fear then lead to philosophy.
How can such a cityhave all of
this filth dwelling, beneath its
postcard beauty? Who created
the demand for the drugs? Did
Mayor Barry grow up in a broken
home? 4

My mind was reeling until I got
inside, got something to drink
and told my mother about all of

my classes. It was an exercise in 2 ‘

familiarity and I quickly forgot
about being in the ’90s answer to
Dodge City. V

The rest of the holiday weekend
was not terrifying and actually
quite nice. The weather was
pleasant, people walked their
dogs, and families had picnics in
their back yards. And much to
our joy, President Bush ﬁnally
caught a fish.

So what did I deduce from a
in hysteria?

Washington, D.C. is a big place,
it has some problems, and it also
happens to be where our nation’s
leaders live and work. And to
those 20/20 commentaries, the
people who find ugliness are
usually the ones who seek it out.

Racial Tensions:

Alive and   well in America

is it 1989 or 1959?
judging fr()m the racial tensions that have been brewing
in many areas of the United States, it is impossible to tell.
Virginia Beach has recently been the site of such

problems between blacks and whites. For the past few.

nights, black youths from local, predominantly black
colleges have been celebrating the end of summer by
committing acts of violence and looting stores. Let’s hope
this does not become a traditional way to celebrate the
arrival of fall all over the United States.

There were more than 650 people arrested and approxi-
mately 50 people injured, some of them severely. What a
great way to start out the new school year — freshly
released from iail or the hospital.

What has caused the black youths to go to such ex-
tremes? It seems that they felt Virginia Beach whites were
not receptive to their needs. Whether or not this is true
(and it may well be), violence is not the way to "get their
attention. Dr. Martin Luther Kingjr. gave hislife to stand
up for his beliefs -— he did not need to commit acts of
violence to get people to listen to him.

Of course, there were warning signs that the authorities
chose to ignore. Many of the black youths have expressed
feeling that they were not welcome in Virginia Beach;
however Virginia Beach Mayor Meyera  Oberndorf
merely dismissed their feelings as “poppycock.”

Oberndorfs refusal to take this situation seriously is a
large part of the problem. There is no excuse for the
violence and looting, but the situation could have been
handled much better than it was. According to one junior
at Hampton College, much of the violence occurred as a
result of the police moving in to clearcrowds of people
who were not doing anything illegal.

To put an end to racial violence and discrimination once
and for all, the existence of such problems must first be
realized. There is no obvious scapegoat — both blacks
and whites are to blame. White people need to be more
aware of their tendencies to discriminate and black
people need to stop looking for it where it may not even
exist. Both sides must realize that violence is not the
answer. Only then can blacks and whites finally live in

peace.

Linebacker Gob digs
 in to fill Olsavsky Void

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

Jerry Olsavsky was too small,
too slow to be drafted by an NFL
team, his detractors, and even his
fans would say.

Olsavsky was drafted by the
Pittsburgh Steelers on the tenth
round of this year's draft.

Even after 367 career tackles,
he was still too small, too slow to
make the cut on an NFL roster,
they said.

Jerry O, only the second man
to record three consecutive 100-
plus tackle seasons for the Pitt
football team since the early
1970s, made the 47-man Steelers
roster Monday.

Now it’s Craig Gob’s turn to
take the heat, and the junior from

- Bethel Park sees no reason why

he should not meet the lofty
expectations set by Olsavsky at
the middle linebacker slot in the
Panther defense.

“Jerry O. was a great leader to
me and a great friend. I learned a
lot from him,” says Gob, who at
6-foot-1, 225 pounds has an inch
and eight pounds on Olsavsky’s
playing weight.

“I’m really not even that big,”
Gob conﬁdes. “I'm about 6 foot,
220 pounds. Speed-wise, I’m
average. I think I get by on
instincts and knowing the
defense."

That was Olsavsky’s claim to
fame in the middle. “A football

‘3sense,” Pitt head coach Mike

Gottfried calls it. And he believes
that Gob, with 38 tackles in just
over two seasons, has it, too.
Which is funny, considering
that Gob, the backup to Olsavsky
last season, was not even the
front-runner for the starting spot
this year when Olsavsky’s

eligibility expired. Gottfried
moved Nelson Walker, a junior
who played defensive end last
season, to the middle, where the
job was seemingly his to lose.

Having that competition made
Gob push himself a little harder,
something not lost on the coaches.
“He won the job,” Gottfried says

“Competition breeds betterness
in players,” Gob says. “It’s only
going to make us better.”

Gob and Walker, however, are
on a rotating system with eacl
seeing their fair share of playing‘
time. Walker sprained an ankle
in Pitt's 38-3 victory over Paciﬁc
last Saturday, and consequently
sat out of practice Monday night,
but Gottfried said that he would
practice yesterday and “should
play” at Boston College this
weekend.

“Taking over the middle
linebacker spot,” says Gob, “it’s
not really taking over. There’s
always Nelson coming in. It’s not
like Coach Gottfried has a 1 and
1A team.”

While the two can flip-ﬂop
positions, Walker was the
prohibitive favorite as the starter
prior to fall camp. Gob believes
his familiarity with the linebacking
scheme was certainly in his favor.

“I did have a good camp. We
really installed a lot of new plays
over camp, and I already knew
the other plays.”

On the heels of Saturday’s
whipping of the Tigers, Gottfried
feels good about the prospect of
having Gob, who collected ﬁve
tackles against Pacific,
quarterbacking the defense.

“I think he did a good job
Saturday,” Gottfried says. “He's
got some big shoes to ﬁll, thou gh.”

That's the part of the deal that
has Gob concerned. “It’s hard

because he was such a great
player for Pitt," he says. And as
far as his performance against
Paciﬁc goes, Gob says, “I made a
lot of mistakes, as did a lot of
people on the team."

Gottfried says Olsavsky was
the kind of player who could
make a mistake, realize it, correct
it with anyone knowing the
difference. “I didn’t want anybody
to know he was gone," Gottfried
quips.

Then again, he’s just on the
other side of town. That's 329
tackles away for Craig Gob.

NOTES: Asked if he was surprised

when Olsavsky made the Steelers
cuts, Gottfried replied, “I would
have been surprised if he didn’t
make it. ”  Tony Siragusa, moved

It’s another one of those years again. As
was 1979. And 1969.

Time for another changing of the guard,
the deca-annual ﬂip-flop that signiﬁes the
demise of one conference in the National
Football League and the reemergence of
the other. In '69, a right arm owned by a
guy named Joe Namath passed the New
York Jets of the exciting but credibility-
starved AFL past the powerful Baltimore
Colts of the NFL, thereby ending nearly 10
years of strict NFL supremacy (at least at
the ticket ofﬁce). Although the two leagues
didn’t start going head-to-head until 1967,
Green Bay and Baltimore of the stuffy NFL
basicaliylcalled the shots in pro football.
Before Namath, the AFL was playground
stuff.

{Then in 1979, it was Terry Bradshaw of
the Pittsburgh Steelers leading his team to
its fourth and ﬁnal Super Bowl win of the
1970s, an era in which the Dallas Cowboys

were the only NFC club to capture an NFL

. title. Pittsburgh, Miami and the Oakland

Raiders were the reigning triumvirate
through those wild years.

And ﬁnally, the 1980s. Only the AFC’s
Raiders were able to win championship
rings during this decade. The National
Conference's San Francisco, Washington,
Chicago and the New York Giants
suffocated the AFC in Super Bowl match-
ups.

NFC, AFC, then NFC. A span covering 30
years of dual-conference professional
football. It’s 1989 and what goes around,
even despite the greenhouse effect, acid
rain, and Miami Vice going off the air, still
has a fairly good chance of coming around.
And, hey, guess who's coming around.

Buffalo, Houston, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
Seattle, and Indianapolis will all challenge
for the Lombardi Trophy this season. And
one of them will win it.

Welcome back, AFC — you wild—eyed
devil, you.

THE AFC EAST

A year ago, actually even three years
ago, the Buffalo Bills were my baby, in a
Rotissiere sort of sense. The Bills were an
up-and-coming bunch that had seen its
share of lean years and were ﬁnally getting
the right ingredients to the recipe together.
The defense was forming. A sharp
quarterback was developing. Running
backs coming around. Itwas fun watching

them build through the newspapers, and '6

it looked like it was going to be fun in
Buffalo.

Then came the 1988 season. Sure the
Bills ran up an impressive 12-4 record and
the fans sure enjoyed the wins, but, boy,
they sure bored the pants off the league
getting there. The defense, anchored by
linebackers Shane Conland, Cornelius
Bennett and the second-best defensive
end in the league, Bruce Smith, is likely
the best in football. It holds this team
together, like most good defenses do. But
offensively, they putyou to sleep. Watching
Buffalo’s offensive performance against
Houston and Cincinnati in the playoffs last

winter was on an even scale with standing
in a big, fat Russian cheese line. Marv
Levy, turn your guys loose this season..
You’ve got way too much TNT in QB Jim
Kelly and wideout Andre Reed to be
fooling around with sparklers. 11-5.
The whole key to the success of the
Indianapolis Colts this season, and this
is no fantastic revelation, is the emergence
of quarterback Chris Chandler. If he comes
through, Indy is a playoff team. If not, Indy
goes 8-8. Head coach Ron Meyer has a
one-man mnning game in Eric Dickerson,
a solid offensive line, a ﬂashy new receiver
in rookie Andre Rison and a defense
competent enough to help win the division.
Chandler, a second—year pro out of
Washington, went 9-4 as a starter last
season while completing 55.4% of his
passes for 1,619 yards and 10 touchdowns.
What else can be said? Chandler, you can
grab this team by the reigns if you want it.
It’s game time, pal, let’s see what you've
got. 9-7.

Denver won, 21-10. The Patriots
are not good enough not to start
Flutie. They may lose some they
should win, but they’ll sure win
some they should lose.

The emergence of second-year
running back John Stevens gives
the Pats its best player at the
position since Sam Cunningham.
And while the loss of linebacker
Andre Tippett for the season due
to injury would be a crippling
loss to most teams, New England
has proven to be one of the most
versatile and compensating teams
in the league on defense and
should still fare well. But with the
bottled magic that Flutie is behind

even better. 7-9.

Lageman is not exactly what this

Enough speculating, though.
The Jets need to keep oft-injured

Netters ta/ee tourney

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

The women’s volleyball
team opened its season last
weekend by stomping their
way through four opponents
to win the Akron Volleyball
Tournament.

The Lady Panthers quickly
disposed of Kent State (15—7,
15-1, 15-4), Cleveland State
(15-7, 15-3, 15-2), and Loyola-
Chicago (15-41, 1 5-1, 15-7), but
stumbled a bit when it came to
host Akron. Head coach Sue
iWoodst,ra’s troop overcame
two losses in the first three
games to the Zips, but
dominated the last two to
capture the tournament crown
14-16, 15-8, 11-15, 15-4-and
15-3.

Woodstra would not point
out any exceptional individual
performances, but she was
pleased with her team’s
performance in her coaching
debut.

“It was a total team effort;
everyone contributed
positively. They responded
very well despite it being very
early in the season,” said
Woodstra. —

However, she pointed out
that it will take a better effort
this weekend, when the Lady
Panthers travel to Illinois for
the Illini Volleyball Classic. At
the Classic, Pitt will take on
Memphis State, Nebraska-
Omaha and host Illinois,
ranked fourth in the Country.

“I think we can beat Illinois,

because it's early in the season, .

they might not be ready. ‘But it
will take‘ an exceptional effort
on our part,” said Woodstra.
“We’re going to work on some
things this week, like
transitions and defense, and
we need a ‘ little more
consistency.”

The Lady Panthers open their
home season tonight against
Cincinnati at 7:30 p.m. at
Fitzgerald Field House.

"?’of the season. They always are.

There's just never enough to get
over the top. 7-9.
Like said of Tom Landry, has
the game of pro football passed
. Don Shula by? The head coach of
the Miami Dolphins would
never acknowledge the issue, but
the Dolphins are reaching lows
not seen since Shula was in

fix Baltimore and George Wilson was

the head man in Miami. The
team’s six wins last season were
the least the Dolphins have had

since 1976, and their 10 losses
were the most ever by a Shula-
coached squad. And the
foreboding coaching staff shake-
up last winter can only be taken
as a move of desperation. Things
seem to be falling apart.

“Our idea of a balanced attack, ”
says ownerjoe Robbie, “has been
the long pass and the short pass.”
In other words, QB‘Dan Marino
is all the offense the Dolphins
possess. Running back Sammie
Smith, a first-round pick from
Florida State, was supposed to

help matters, but in the dash for
cash, Smith and Robbie have yet
to agree on contract terms.
Defensively? Keep holding your
nose. 5-11.

Champions of the AFC, 1989. If it
weren’t for their powder blue
uniforms, you’d think they were
the Oakland Raiders incarnate.
Mean, nasty, likes lots of penalties,
hits like a case of Nightrain. Yep,
that’s Houston. They play the

be successful in the 1990s. The
weapons are there on both
defense and offense and have
been for a few years now. What's
finally different is the team
attitude: positive, cocky,

aggressive. That playoff
experience last season didn't hurt
matters much, either, although
only 18 points from the offense
would have beaten Buffalo. The
only downside is that the team
lost 15 players to free agency,

nearly one-third of the squad.

Kind of breaks up some
continuity. 13-5.

You’re in lab doing some
bizarre, uninteresting experiment,
like testing the effects of 1,000
molar hydrosulfuric acid on the
disposition of the gerbil. So you’re
breezing along, plotting the data,
you’ve got this real smooth curve
going, looks like you’1l‘be out
two hours early, then WHAMO!
A strange, unexplicable data blip
shows up on the graph paper,
screwing up the whole
experiment. That blip was the
1988 Cincinnati Bengals.

Two years ago, the coach had
a foot and four toes out the door,
the team finished last in the
division, no defense, crazy losses,
the whole. thing was in shambles.
Then Presto! AFC Champions 3565
days later. Cincy even should
have beaten the 49ers in the
Super Bowl, had any pass rush
materialized against that final Joe
Montana drive. Says head coach
Sam Wyche, “I've written letters
to all our players‘during the off?
season. I told them: ‘We had a

tremendous vear in 1988. a
storybook year in a lot of ways.

Now we’re going to find out if
we’re a truly good team, or just a

team that put together one good g

year.”’ Strange, strange situation
here, folks. Didn’t help themselves
in the draft much with RB Eric
Ball. NT Tim Krurnrie’s recovery
from a celebrated broken

leg in the Super Bowl should be
interesting. 9-7. —

Didn't like the Cleveland I

Browns’ decision to harass head

coach Marty Schottenheimer out I
‘of the organization, but it V

happened and things must go on
in Cleveland. A step away from
the Super Bowl two of the past
three years, the Browns appear
to be fading. It's up to new coach
Bud Carson to put some color
back into the team. The team
needs QB Bernie Kosar now more
than ever -— not a good position
to be in; see Miami Dolphins -
as the rushing attack has ' been
decimated by the trade of Earnest
Byner and the drug conviction of
Kevin Mack. Rookie Eric Metcalf,
a scatback rookie from Texas, is
all Cleveland has to brag about in
that department. The key, though,
as it’s been the last three seasons
for the Browns, is finding a solid

pass rush. And that is Carson's

specialty. 8-7-1. ,

Another rebuilding year for the
Pittsburgh Steelers, which
basically sums up the 1980s for
the franchise. The team's coaches
are excited about first-round picks
RB Tim Worley and OL T om
Ricketts of Pitt, but when one of
your starting cornerbacks is
waived outright in training camp,
you know something is dreadfully

.wrong./ QB Bubby Brister has 2

talent and attitude to be an
eventual all-pro. 5-11.

Continued from page 9
what is known as a good, old-
fashioned last hurrah. WR Steve
Largent is in his last season. QB
Dave Kreig is getting up there in
age. RB Curt Warner has his better
days behind him. Even head

. coach Chuck Knox seems to be

getting ready to move on soon.
The defense is an interesting blend
of youth and experience. This
team reminds me of the Steelers

of 1982. Talented, but old.
Determined, but tired. Knox is
gathering his troops for one last
run at the Super Bowl. 10-6.
Ever seen a more talented team
that stinks as bad as the Los
Angeles Raiders do? Probably
not. Well, maybe those Gerry
Faust teams at Notre Dame in the
early 1980s. And what did Notre
Dame do about that particular
problem? They hired Lou Holtz

and won a national championship
three years later. The players
haven’t responded to second-year
head coach Mike Shanahan as
well as ownerA1 Davis had hoped.
He should be gone after this
season. One interesting change
going on in Lzk the team is
cleaning house on defense. Matt
Millen, Mike Haynes, Otis Wilson,
Linden King —— all waived. A

the best thing for this stale
franchise. 7-9

Watch what new head coach
Marty Schottenheirner does for
the Kansas City Chiefs. If anyone
can turn around a Vagabond
franchise, it’s the young
Schottenheimer. RB Paul Palmer,
thought to be the savior of the
running game when he was
drafted two years ago out of
Temple, has been waived, so that
area needs some revamping. Also,
KC can’t expect to win with age—
old QBs Steve DeBerg and Ron
Jaworski hobbling in the pocket.
Look for the Chiefs to deal for
Dallas QB Steve Walsh and take
off into the 19903. 7—9.

The Denver Broncos are the
Dolphins of the AFC West. No

rushing game, no defense, just

QB_]ohn Elway*s right arm. Coach‘

Dan Reeves will squeeze a few
wins out of this team on his
genius alone, but that isn’t going
to make owner Pat Bowlen the
happiest of people in the Mile
High City. 5-11.

The San Diego Chargers are
starting from scratch also. Dan

Henning left his assistant job with”
the Redskins to take the insecure‘ C

head coaching job. The team
also acquired QB Jim McMahon
from Chicago to spruce up

a desolate position. Lots of talent
in San Diego, although much of
it misguided. This could once
again be a fun team to watch,
but... 4-12.
