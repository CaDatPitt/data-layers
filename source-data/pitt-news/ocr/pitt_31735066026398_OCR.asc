The Pitt News

In the rowing community, a boat christen-
ing is much like a baptism: filled with ritual
and hopes for the future.

But the Pitt Crew Club’s new boat sparked
controversy when last year’s SGB allocated
the $10,000 for the boat out of the money that
was supposed to be allocated by this year’s
board.

Adding to the questions raised is the fact
that one of the SGB members who voted on the
grant was a member of the crew team.

Despite the controversy, most of the Pitt
Crew c1ub’s 70 members braced themselves
against the driving rain on the front lawn of
the William Pitt Union yesterday as Coach
Tom Ridenhour and team president Eric
McDonald poured champaign over the bow of
the boat and officially named it the Johnny
Eaton 0’Meara.

David Teeters, a member of the rowing
club and a member of the SGB when the boat-
funding request was made, said his member-
ship wasn’t a factor in granting the funds for
the boat.

“I didn’t do anything unorthodox or uneth-
ical. But when it came to being an advocate for

Despite meeting deadline, Panther Prints is still on life support

Despite a new editor and adviser
and making its deadline for the first
time in recent years, the same old prob-
lems plague the Panther Prints
Yearbook — a decrease in buyers and
an increase in debt.

For the past few years, the Student
Publications Board has tried to boost
sales, but students still aren’t biting.

So why won’t anyone buy year-
books, and why is there so much debt
each year?

According to those who have been
involved with the yearbook, missed
deadlines and financial instability have
always had a home at the Panther
Prints. A lack of communication
between staff members has added to the
turmoil.

Also, the University has made it
clear that it wants a yearbook, but so far
has not made any strict committment to
continue funding it.

“If [the University] doesn’t make a
commitment, I don’t think [Panther

Prints] is going to be around much
longer,” said Student Publications
Board Chairman Kurt Saunders.

But the problems aren’t all within
the Panther Prints, and they aren’t
unique to Pitt. Universities all around
the country have had problems getting
students to buy yearbooks.

“Some colleges and universities
have just abandoned yearbooks alto-
gether,” said Saunders.

The Publications Board is waiting
to see how far Pitt will go to keep
Panther Prints alive.

The board is developing a new pro-
gram that it hopes will revive the dying
yearbook and once again make Pitt stu-
dents get excited about the tradition of
a university yearbook.

Financial instability = a

sinking ship

But making its deadline doesn’t
mean the yearbook is out of trouble.

In fact, deadlines are the least of
its troubles.

It seems the only tradition

embodied by Panther Prints is its
financial instability. For years, the

publication has been close to shutting
down due to lack of student purchas-
es and yearly debts of around
$20,000.

“Since I’ve been on the board,
the yearbook has been an ongoing
concern,” said Saunders, a member
since 1990.

The expenses for the 1998 year-
book are projected to be $68,000,
according to Saunders, but even if the
Panther Prints achieves its goal of
selling 980 books this year, it will
only make $49,000, leaving a
$19,000 debt.

Panther Prints is not expected to
make its goal. As of now, its editors
have only sold 500 books.

however, that these
problems also occur-
ring at campuses other than Pitt.

No one is biting

In the 1960s and 70s, when many
current students’ parents were in col-
lege, school spirit seemed more evi-
dent.

More people showed up for foot-
ball and basketball games than today,
and everyone sought to participate in
as many activities as possible.

And students bought yearbooks.

Times have changed, and so have
students. They just don’t care any-
more, mostly because students at
large colleges don’t want to pay the
high price for a book of photos of
people they don’t know.

“It’s different than a high school
yearbook,” said Pitt freshman Luca
Covi. “I probably won’t know anyone
in it.”

Tynen said he has met through
the years with numerous media
advisers from universities all over the
country who have voiced the same
concern —— people aren’t buying.

“Today’s students have so many
other responsibilities and concerns

CREW

Pitt Crew, I guess I was,” Teeters
said. “Other organizations consis-
tently get large sums of money
throughout the year, and [consider-
ing] how active Pitt Crew is, I
believe that it’s a completely justi-
fied amount to spend.”

Current student-government
members say the crew club got such
a substantial amount of money
because last year’s SGB thought
there was a surplusof funds. This
happened after it miscalculated the
allocations money and approved
$70,000 worth of equipment that the
allocations manual forbids. The SGB
has the power to overrule the manu-
al.

The allocations manual requires

1 the Allocations Committee to deny

funding for equipment used for
“direct competition” —— such as the
crew team —— with other schools.
Funding, however, can be used for
intramural sports. 5

Current Allocations Committee
Chair Chris Boback said he thinks
the previous board granted the
request because it miscalculated the
money available and started granting
“dream requests.”

He said doing so was not a wise
move for last year’s SGB to make.

“I would have known how much
money was left for emergency

“Our expenses are huge, our boat
bay costs $15,000 a year to rent,” he
said. ‘‘All we asked for were alloca-
tions for the boat. We had no say
whether or not we got the funds.”

Coach Ridenhour also defended
the allocation, saying, “It’s impossi-
ble for us to raise enough funds to
but this type of equipment.” He
added that the SGB “should count
their money better.”

Team member Michael Simon
adopted a different tactic in defend-
ing the new boat, saying he thought
that the criticism was unfair.

“The money could have gone
towards helping a lot more clubs
out,” said Simon. “I think it was our
year to get this stuff. We’re just as
money-hungry as everyone else.”

Because the current SGB had\

only $37,000 to divide between all
student groups this year, many
groups got considerably less than
they claim to need. A

One of these groups ‘was the Pitt
Hockey Club. Head Coach Wade
Chouinard said he is disappointed
with the amount of money the team
received and that the players will
have to raise funds to make up the
difference.

“We run costs up to $40,000 or
$50,000 a season,” he said. “We
were basically asking for a third of
those costs. We were originally ask-
ing for [$20,000]; we got [$9,000.]”

that they don’t have the old—time
school spirit,” explained Tynen.

And large, metropolitan schools
like Pitt have other factors to worry
about, such as a higher number of
commuters and more activities to
“draw students away from the cam-
pus,” said Kusniez.

Penn State’s yearbook La Vie,
which has always sold strongly, has
seen a slow decline in interest in
recent years. Its sales remain around
3,000 per year but are dropping.

“Out of 33,000 students, 3,000 is
still not Very good,” said La Vie’s
Business Manager Michael Kostic.

Matilde Consales, assistant editor
of L’Esprit du Dac, the yearbook of
Duquesne University, which gives its
books away for free
said
many seniors don’t
even bother to pick
up the book unless
they know their
picture will appear
in it. .

Lack of stu-
dent interest
reflects on
yearbook
staff

The history of
Pitt’s yearbook
staff has been one
of editors quitting
before their tenure
had expired, leaving the rest of the
staff and the advisers to put together
an unfinished book.

Saunders said these resignations
can be attributed to students’ decreas-
ing lack of interest in buying year-
books.

“The editor bows out before the
end of the year because their time
isn’t producing something the people
really want,” said Saunders.

Many times, the rush to get the
book done on time leaves the remain-
der of the staff disorganized. Staff
members are left disgruntled and
uninformed, contributing to their
frustrations and causing many of
them also to quit.

“There should be much more
communication between layout and
photographers,” said Rodgers.

Isadora Murphy, co-photo editor
for the yearbook this year, said she
has noticed a lack of communication
among the staff and that she also is
rarely notified of changes.

She said she never knew the year-
book made this year’s deadline and
couldn’t understand how this is pos-
sible, considering the stacks of photo
assignments she still has to complete.

“There were a whole lot of com-
munication problems the first semes-
ter,” said Biedrzycki.

She said she has tried to keep in
touch with the 15 other staff mem-
bers, but it is difficult to work around
their conflicting schedules.

Murphy is also frustrated by stu-
dents’ lack ‘of interest.

“I don’t know a single, solitary
person who is going to buy one,” said
Murphy.

Murphy said she has even spoken
to students who didn’t know Pitt even
had a yearbook.

The solution?
The University has helped by

He Said

paying the book’s
debts for the past
few years. The
problem is, the
Publications Board
does not know how
much longer the
school will pick up
the tab.

In trying once
again to revive the
book, the
Publications
Boards’ Panther
Prints committee
came up with a
plan last week to
try to boost sales.

The plan
would entail asking
the University to
help fund the book,
either from its own pocket or through
an extra fee incorporated in students’
tuition. ,

“I voted in favor of the resolution
because, if for no other reason, I’d
like the University to take a position
on the yearbook,” said Saunders.

The board wants the University
to take a stand to support the year-
book because its tradition and history
are strong and important to the
school.

“It’s been let known that the
University wants tradition,” said
Kusniez.

If the plan is accepted, the fee,
which would be a few dollars per stu-
dent per semester, will guarantee
every senior a yearbook when he
graduates. ‘

This will, in turn, lower the cost
of yearbooks for underclassmen from
$35 to only $15, said Biedrzycki. The
more yearbooks ordered from the
company, the cheaper each additional
one will be. ‘

This plan, the board hopes, will
both be accepted by the University
and restore yearbooks to their level
of popularity 30 years ago.

Slow to recognize evils in the world

John Lacny

A book full of nothing
really memorable

So, not many people are buying the Panther Prints
yearbook. ‘

Big surprise.

Let's face it: Pitt is a big commuter school, and it just
doesn't lend itself to the kind of a c1ose—knitsocial struc-
ture that made high school yearbooks valuable keep-
sakes. '

Of the 30,000 students in the University, most peo-
ple will meet only a fraction of a percent of those.

Pitt is not like high school in this regard. When we
graduated from high school, we usually knew every
senior in the yearbook. At the very least, we. had seen

everybody in the book once in our lives, even if we

weren't the best of ﬁiends.

But if you're an average Pitt student, the odds of
ﬁnding many people you know in the Pitt yearbook is
s .

That is, you probably won't know a thousand other
Pitt students unless youre a member of a big organiza-
tion, like the Greek system or the club sports. But those
organizations who would beneﬁt most from a pictorial
record that captured their histories aren't featured in ﬂie
Panﬂier Prints book \

Instead, there will be lots of photos of big crowds
and people you don't recognize, like shots of the Liberty
Bowl in Memphis that aren't very likely to capture you
or anybody you recognize. And they certainly won't
include photos of you and your pals at the pub before the
game.

Those are the college memories that most of us want
to keep with us forever, but don't expect to ﬁnd them
recorded in a $35 volume that features the kids who
thought "Shoot Yourself" cameras were a cheaper way
to claim their place in history than buying senior photos.

VV1thout context, and without you or people you
know in them, those pictures will mean nothing, because
your college memories will be about what you did and
whom you met.

Or as Pink Floyd put it: "All ﬂiat you touch, and all
that you see, is all that your life will ever be."

If you're going to spend almost $40 on a record of
college memories, you would be much wiser to buy ﬁlm
and take pictures yourself. At least then you would have
photos that will mean something to you in a few years.

If the yearbook is ever going to sell, it must be aimed
at the people who will ﬁnd it to be a valuable memoir of
their college experiences: Greeks, athletes and active
members of large organizations.

Anything else is a waste of material.

columnist

The late Archbishop Oscar
Romero of San Salvador once told
his fellow Catholics that they had to
"repent the sin of [their] church
when it fails to denounce injustice
in our world." For taking stands like
this —— including asking the U.S.
government to stop funding the
murderous Salvadoran military —
Romero paid with his life.
Especially around Easter time, such
words might be cause for reﬂection
among Catholics. But one recent

event ought to be bringing the issue

of repentance to the forefront for all
Americans, regardless of religion
(or irreligion, for that matter).

Maura Clarke, Ita Ford and
Dorothy Kazel of the Maryknoll
religious order, along with Jean
Donovan, a church layworker, were
four American women who took the
injunction of Oscar Romero very
seriously. They left the United
States to stand in solidarity with the
embattled poor of El Salvador, a
country then in the midst of a
bloody civil war.

On Dec. 2, 1980, these women
were raped and shot to death by
members of the Salvadoran
National Guard. In 1981, Alexander
Haig — then secretary of state
under the Reagan administration -
put forth the brilliant theory that the
three unarmed nuns and their lay
companion had been killed while
trying to run a military blockade.
For the most part, though, U.S. and
Salvadoran ofﬁcials would not go
so far as to justify the murders,
claiming instead that the nuns‘

assailants had acted on their own, -

and that the crimes were apolitical.
On March 28 of this year, how-

ever, all four of the National
Guardsmen involved in the killings
ﬁnally armounced from prison that
they had acted on orders from
above, and that the heads of the
original ofﬁcial committees of
investigation had organized a cover-
up. This is further vindication of a
1993 UN Truth Commission report,
which concluded that National
Guard Director Col. Carlos Eugenio
Vides Casanova and Minister of
Defense Gen. Jose Guillermo
Garcia had protected the ofﬁcers
who gave the order.

Despite this further evidence,
the U.S. government is refusing to
admit the truth; State Department

spokesman James Rubin has said

that the United States is "unclear"
about the "veracity" of the confes-
sions. This is unsurprising, since the
truth is still potentially embarrass-
ing to the United States. After all,
Vides Casanova and Guillermo
Garcia are now both living in
Florida, having been granted resi-
dence in the United States. This is
their reward for helping to carry out
counterinsurgency operations in El
Salvador with the aid of the United
States, which in this case included
the murders of four American citi-
zens.

Dead American citizens are
particularly embarrassing for the
U.S. government because it has the
potential to spark demands for the
cutoff of military assistance to
regimes like the one that ran El
Salvador in the 1980s. Therefore, it
was necessary for the newly
installed Reagan administration to
claim that the nun killings were not
ordered by officers of the military it
was ﬁmding. The issue of U.S.-
sponsored political violence goes
beyond assaults on American citi-

THE PITT NEWS

zens, of course, although in this case
(as elsewhere) it tended totake at
least several hundred dead
Salvadorans to make the same kind
of impact on the U.S. national con-
sciousness as did four dead
American women. And in most
cases, the subservient U.S. media
buried such stories quickly.

In early 1982, for instance,
Raymond Bonner of The New York
Times reported that a Salvadoran
Army battalion had carried out a
massacre at the village of El
Mozote. The Reagan administration
quickly dropped the insinuation that
Bonner (and, by extension, the "lib-
eral media" represented by the
Times) was an agent of the Kremlin,
and Times Editor Abe Rosenthal
quickly indulged his masters at the
White House by recalling Bonner to
New York.

Ten years later, a UN forensic
anthropology team recovered over
750 skeletons at El Mozote, many
of them young children who had
been shot with U.S.—made bullets.
The massacre was carried out by the
sadistic Atlacatl Battalion, whose
commander — Domingo
Monterrosa —— was a graduate of the

notorious U.S. Army School of the —

Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia.
Unfortrmately, the truth comes
too late to help El Salvador. U.S.
sponsorship of the military and its
death squads was never out off even
at the height of the killing. Perhaps
these latest revelationswill inspire
repentance among those who
ignored the truth during the time
when it might have saved lives. I
wouldn't hold your breath, though.

John Lacny dreamed he saw Che
Guevara last night, alive as you and
me.

Hoop dreams

(and cash) spur

early exits

“Thanks, but no thanks.”
T‘hat’s what a record 20 college basket-

ball players said to their respective schools,

teammates and coaches following the 1994
season.

The mass exodus of college-hoops tal-
ent that has visions of illegal defenses and
canying veterans’ bags on roadtrips has
begun yet again this year.

And yes, we oﬂicially have our ﬁrst
prep star bypassing the world of academia
for the pros in'Hargrave Military Academy
phenom Korleone Young, who armounced
his plans to become eligible for the June 24
NBA draft.

Since the Kentucky Wildcats took
home the NCAA Tomnament crown earlier
this month, ﬁve players (at least at press
time) have decided to forego the remaining
years of their amateur eligibility to take their
shot at the next level.

Only two, arguably, of the ﬁve have a
better-than-average shot at making an NBA
roster — Michigan’s Robert Traylor and
Kansas’ Paul Pierce, both juniors. But in the
day and age of expansion, parity throughout
the league, combined with pesky agents and
a lack of motivation in the classroom, has
caused an armual going-away party on cam-
puses across the country.

The other three players that have Just
Said No to continuing their education are
Iowa freshman Ricky Davis, Florida State
junior Randell Jackson and Tyronn Lue, the
Nebraska junior who is making an attempt
to become the ﬁrst Asian-bom player to
make an NBA team

Unforttmately, the press conferences
aren’t over yet and the end doesn’t look to
be in sight

Do all these players feel that they have
nothing left to prove in the college game?

Maybe not _

Many of the budding young stars in
college sports, not just basketball, were

. -forced to grow up under unfortunate cir-
c\ ?lII1SIal'lCBS —— both ﬁnancially and socially.
. The ﬁnancial windfall known as the
NBA offers them an escape from a some-
times penniless youth, where a keen jump
shot or a good drop step is their only ticket
out of impending doom.

Granted, this isn’t the case for some
college athletes, but it is the unforttmate
truth for many kids who need these paydays
to help family and friends escape unhealthy
living conditions.

But all pity aside, with some it might
simply be greed

Vikings clown Pitt
in rainy matinee

Kevin Lilley

Column, page 10

Sports Edltor

Pitt designated hitter Bill Brown liked
yesterday’s home plate umpire until the
game’s ﬁnal pitch.

In the bottom of the ninth, with the
Panthers down 5-4, Brown stepped to the
plate with a runner on second and two outs.
The count went quickly to 3-2, and with his
sixth pitch of the at—bat, Cleveland State
pitcher Mickey Moses ﬁred a high fastball.

Brown took the pitch and trotted
toward ﬁrst

He got about ﬁve stops before the
home plate umpire punched the air and
called strike three, ending the game and
handing Pitt its 15th loss of the season.

“That was the worst pitch of the day!”
Brown screarned_at the arbiter before leav-
ing the ﬁeld Ten minutes later, after a
chance to cool off in a postgarne team
meeting, Brown hadn’t changed his mind

‘That was horrible,” he said. “That
was the worst way to end the game. We’ve
been here for four hours, with the [rain]
delay and all  he screwed the game up on
that call.”

The delay actually pushed the game to
about three and one-half hours, but no one
was counting. In the bottom of the seventh,
with Pitt behind 4-3, the rain began to fall.

The game kept moving anyway, as
Panther leadoﬂ hitter Chris Delsignore hit a
ﬂy ball out to third base and Jason Oliver
struck out swinging.

Before Pitt shortstop Lou Melucci

 

reached the plate, the
drizzle became a
downpour and the
wind knocked the
speaker system over.
Melucci’s foul ﬂy
out to ﬁrst base drift-
ed so far out of play
that Cleveland
State’s Jeff Hasse set
himself three differ-
ent times while
attempting to catch
the ﬂy.

Eventually, he
caught it. And before
the top of the eighth
started, the ﬁeld
caught it, too. Water
rushed down fast,
prompting the
grounds crew and
the Pitt players to
race for the tarpau—
lins.

Twenty minutes later, the game was
back on. Viking hitter Marty Healy began
the post-shower eighth with a ﬂy out, but
Keith Lillash followed him up with a hard
shot that landed at the base of the right—cen—
ter-ﬁeld fence.

Lillash rounded ﬁrst on his way to at
least a double, before slipping and falling
ﬂat on the wet Trees Field grass. He settled
for a single. On the very next pitch, Hasse
smacked a double that landed in the same
spot, scoring Hasse and chasing Pitt pitcher

 

Jory Cougenhour, the eventual game loser,
from the contest.

Pitt righty Matt Irvin came in to stop
the bleeding, pitching the ﬁnal one and
two-thirds innings without giving up a run.

The swampy inﬁeld would come to
Pitt’s aid again in the bottom of the eighth,
when Brown’s slow roller to second
stopped rolling and stuck in the mud, giv-
ing the DH an inﬁeld single. He moved to
second on a strikeout, then moved on to
third when a pickoff attempt bounced off

After Saturday’s 43-43 tie in the annu-
al Blue-Gold game, the Pitt football quar-
terback situation looked a little clearer, as
ﬁfth—year senior Matt Lytle may have
tossed his way into next season’s starting

’ job. Two other quarterbacks, Tony

Zimmerman and Matt O’Conner, look to
challenge Lytle for that position in sum-
mer training camp, but as far as the com-
petition goes, the sophomore contender
sums it up in few words.

“We’re all competing for a spot on the
same team, which kind of makes things
difficult at times,” said Zimmerman.
“Everyone is pushing themselves, and I
think it’s great competition, because we’re
all working harder to beat each other.”

TONY ZIMNIERMAN

Zirnmerrnan’s high school numbers
were so impressive that he made a verbal
commitment to Pitt at the beginning of his
high school junior season — a junior sea-
son that he rnissed due to reconstructive
knee surgery, mind you.

But the former Penn-Traﬁord quarter-
back rebounded the next season, leading
the WPIAL in passing yards and being
named a high school All-American. As a
result, the Trafford, Pa., native was one of
the most highly touted quarterbacks in the
country but already knew where his foot-
ball future was leading him.

And now that his football future has
become the present he is in a tight compe-
tition with Lytle for the No.-1 quarterback

 

  
    

lylle  in st ’s 1 starter e lez

THE PITT NEWS

spot, the territory is still a bit unfamiliar to
Zimmerman.

“I’ve been in the system for two years
now, and I should be picking up most of
the plays,” Zimmerman said. “But even
though I’ve been in this system for this
long, this is the ﬁrst time I’ve really taken
reps, so it’s still pretty new to me.”

The 6-3, 225-pound Zimmerman has
gotten to take some snaps in his two years
at Pitt. In his freshman campaign, he
appeared in six games as a substitute for
Pete Gonzalez, but was relegated to back-
up duties during his sophomore season.

Despite some oﬂiseason controversy,
(he was involved in a minor scuﬂle at a
well—known restaurant) Zimmerman
returned to the ﬁeld for spring drills,
poised to be Matt Lytle’s top competitor at
the quarterback spot. But after a disap-
pointing showing in the Blue-Gold game,
Zimmerman vowed to make improve-
ments over this summer.

“I’m really going to dedicate myself.
I’m going to check myself and see what I
need to be doing. I’m going to talk to the
coaches to see what I need to be doing. It’s
just about time for me to sell out and do
whatever they ask and whatever they want
for me to play.”

MATT LYTLE

Lytle has hidden in the shadows of
Pete Gonzalez and John Ryan for the past
four years, but now he is considered to be
the ﬁont-runner for the starting quarter-
back position. Lytle strengthened his grip
on the starting job with a solid Blue-Gold
outing, but as he insists, it’s not simply the

  to 

gunsllngers  

fact that he’s been with the program for
the past few years that has gotten him
ready for the possible role. Self—motiva-
tion made this spring a productive one for
the signal-caller.

“Ever since the end of the bowl game,
I decided to make a commitment to work
as hard as I can and not look back,” he said
after the Blue-Gold scrimmage.

Part of working hard included watch-
ing game tapes over and over during the
off-season, improving an already vigorous
conditioning program, and essentially, as
Lytle put it, “picking Coach [Walt] Harris’
brain and doing what I’m coached to do.

“I‘here’s a long way to go in those 1.7
weeks, but I think that  I’ve got to pre-
pare myself from now until the day of the
Vrllanova game, and I’m not going to stop
working to get better. The more I practice,
the better I’ll get, so I’m going to take it
ﬁom there.”

Like Zimmerman, the Wyomissing
Hills, Pa., native came to Pitt with high
accolades. A USA Today honorable-men-
tion AH-American player, Lytle wasn’t
known for his football talents as much as
he was known for his baseball prowess -
he was courted by major league scouts
during high school and American Legion
baseball.

But the 6-4, 225-pound Lytle chose
Pitt football, and although some fans tend
to forget this, Lytle has more experience at
quarterback than both of his competitors
combined.

He started in nine games at quarter-
back in 1996 (replacing Pete Gonzalez
after Gonzalez suffered a season-ending
knee injury), and after three seasons at
Pitt, Lytle entered the 1997 season at No.
14 on the school’s all-time career passing-
yards list with 1,549.

Although he was relegated to the No.-
2 quarterback slot behind Gonzalez during
last season, Lytle cited Gonzalez as one of
the prime components in his growth as a
quarterback.

“Pete set a good groundstone for the
program, as well as for the quarterbacks,
and I deﬁnitely learned from what he did,”
said Lytle. He did a lot of good things, and
I want to learn the goods from the b .”

MATT O’CONNER

A transfer student from Aloha, Ore.,
Matt O’Conner is used to the West Coast
offense, and he hasn’t had a problem ﬁt-
ting in with Walt Harris’ scheme. Thanks
to this experience — experience neither
Lytle nor Zimmerman can match — the
junior quarterback is making tremendous
strides in his ﬁrst spring with the Pitt foot-
ball team.

“I’m really pleased with Matt
O’Conner,” said Harris. “For a guy who

just came in here and has gotten every-
thing thrown at him, he’s shown sparks of
a guy who could possibly play at this
level.”

After using the West Coast offense at
Saddleback Community College in
Mission Viejo, Ca]if., O’Conner’s transi-
tion to the Pittsburgh game hasn’t been too
tumultuous, but he sees plenty of room for
growth in his game.

“It’s obvious from today that I came
out here to play, and my performance
today isn’t going to get me on the ﬁeld, so
obviously I need to make a lot of improve-
ments,” O’Conner said about his perfor-
mance in the Blue-Gold game.

O’Conner has a lot of room to grow
into the system; last season at Saddleback
Community College, the lanky quarter-
back completed only 31 of 70 passes for
470 yards in 10 games. However, these
statistics are deceiving — six of those
passes were touchdowns, and O’Conner
threw only one interception all season.

Luckily for O’Conner, his spot on the 3

roster won’t solely rely on last weekend’s

performance (he completed seven of 15 :

passes for 88 yards). But fellow quarter-

back Zimmerman can testify to)

O’Conner’s improvements.

“Coach Harris is letting Matt grow
into the system, not really pressuring him,
but expecting him to know something
when fall camp comes around,” said
Zimmerman of O’Conner.

 FROM PAGE 7

Out of high school, many athletes
who have shown the ability to compete
on the college level in their respective
sport are stripped of their individuality
and become a commodity rather than a
human being.

College coaches solidify their
front lines and prepare for months‘ in
the trenches when the bidding wars
begin for these prodigies.

Campus visits are made, and

instead of thinking about national"

championship banners and the pursuit
of a degree, prep stars are looking at
college as a pit stop — a stint in the
minor leagues of the NBA, if you will.

All of these questions are raised
about how schools and the NBA can
team up and attempt to curb this out-of-
contnol retreat from education and a life
in the pros that may never even begin.

Mark Blount, Pittsburgh’s own 7-
foot sophomore who improved expo-
nentially between his ﬁrst and second
seasons, just didn’t seem to be cut out
for college. An agent convinced him
that he could take his talents and devel-
op them in the NBA. ’

It’s not that easy.

I Yes, Blount was drafted in the sec-
ond round by the Seattle Supersonics,
but he didn’t last one week in camp
before being cut. He has since explored
opportunities to play in the CBA and
overseas without much luck.

Rather then building oﬁ‘ a solid
junior year in which he could have led
the Panthers to the NH semiﬁnals,
Blount is nowhere to be found in the
basketball world

At least not the one that Mr. Agent
convinced him he could thrive in

Irl 1979, Magic Johnson was one
of four underclassmen to jump to the
NBA.

He has become a lock for the Hall
of Fame and is arguably the best point
guard to play the game.

James Worthy and Michael Jordan
both left North Carolina early for the
NBA, Worthy with having a stellar
career with the Lakers and being
named one of the 50 greatest players of
all time.

Jordan has done pretty well in the
league over the years, too.

But for every Magic and Michael
there are many more Dontonio
Wmgﬁelds and Mark Blounts.

The Final Four this year could
have included the likes of Allen
Iverson, Stephon Marbury and Shareef
Abdur-Rahim —— three of the most
exciting young players in the league.
Instead, you would have to go to the
ESPN vault for tapes of the last time
these young men played a college
game. '

Rather than making public service
armouncements encouraging students
to stay in school — like the announce-
ments that the NBA’ s two top rookies,

THE PITT NEWS

Trrn Duncan and Keith Van Horn have
done — these budding stars push any-
thing ﬁom overpriced athletic shoes
and apparel to sports magazines.

Right now there is a college kid
talking to his coach about how he has
always dreamed of buying his mom a
new house or being able to get his fam-
ily the simple things in life that they
never could afford. No one has the
right to take those dreams away from
these kids, but someone has to make
them understand that patience is a
virtue. -

After his senior season at Wake
Forest, Duncan was expected by many
to forego his senior year and j to
the pros. Instead, he said, “I’ve been
poor for 21 years, what’s one more?”

Van Horn, who also was expected
to leave Utah following his third sea-
son, kept a promise he had made to his
fatherpriortohisdeath—tostayin
school all four years and earn his
degree.

More of today’s players should
leam front men like Duncan and Van
Horn, but rmfortnnately this isn’t likely
to happen any time soon.

For now, we must deal with most
messages from young players to even
younger audiences that consist of the
advice, “All nude. Tastefully done, but
deﬁnitely all n .”

the CSU shortstop’s leg and into the outﬁeld.

The delay in the action gave the grounds crew a
chance to spray-paint home plate white — it had been
buried under mud since the game restarted — before
Pitt’s Danin Lenhart came to bat.

‘ The new target didn’t help Viking pitcher Jim Rieke
much —— Harry Ciavarella smacked an RBI groundout to
pull Pitt within one. Then, despite the glossy home—plate
ﬁnish that was visible (not to mention noticeable by the
paint fumes) from the next state, Rieke walked two
straight Pitt batters, earning him an early exit.

He was relieved by Moses, the second sidearm
pitcher of the day for Cleveland.

“It’s the ﬁrst time I think we’ve seen sidearm pitch-
ing,” said Melucci, “but the ball doesn’t come to home
plate any faster.”

Moses and his sidewinding delivery easily retired
Panther Kevin Foley, ending the inning./And other than
a one-out double by Joe LaMarco, the Vikings went qui-
etly in the top of the ninth.

'Ihat brought up Pitt’s half of the inning, which
Delsignore began with a single to right ﬁeld He
advanced to second on a sacriﬁce bunt by Oliver, setting
up Melucci for a game-winning hit.

Instead, Melucci delivered a weak grounder to the
third baseman, who juggled the ball a bit before throw-
ing Melucci out by a step. Delsignore did not advance on
the play —— he would not advance on the game-ending
called strikeout by Brown, either.

“We’re just beating ourselves,” Brown said after the
contest. “We’ve just got to keep our heads in it  and los-

much.”
