Spring Festival Committees Plan

Nationality Villages

for Carnival

Carnival Night committeemen, hav-9

ing formulated a new policy for the
Thursday night festival feature, an-
nounced this week ‘theft "the carnival
will adopt for its ‘theme-nationality
villages.

Booths at this year’s Carnival
Night will be decorated -along the
lines of the Nationality rooms in the
Cathedral. Most campus organiza-
tions will participate by setting up
amusement bootlis.

According to the tentative plans,
the six villages will be decorated in
early American, Chinese, German,
Italian, Russian, and English village
style by 18 campus honorary and ac-
tivity organizations; three will co-
operate in the decoration and man-
agement of each village.

A $25 prize will be awarded the
best decorated village according to
Wilford Sklar, BA40, business man-
ager. This award will be distributed
among the three organizations par-
ticipating in the village.

With an eye on the income, the car-
nival night committee has decreed
that the entire proceeds of the re-
freshment booths will be divided
among the 18 participating organiza-
tions. The booths will be under the
supervision of the committee in
charge of Spring Festival.

Held at Trees Field behind the Sta-

dium, Carnival Night is scheduled for

'1‘hursda,y, May ll. Robert Boucek,
C40, is .chair1n:a1'i of the even:-'1.*1‘1g

W'illianns Rewards
Critical Stuck-asst
“Vials Candy Bar

In the midst of a profound and
impressive hush, Dr. Bengamin H.
Williams, professor 61"" political.
science, presented the B. H. Wil-
liams prize for distinguished
critical scholarship to Michael
Berardino, C40, in world politics
class Wednesday.

Prize was a candy bar, valued ~
at a nickel.

Berardino’s contribution to the
cause was made when he discov-
ered that there was no “u” in the
word “contrary;” a mistake he
discovered in Dr. Wil1:'a.vn’s text on
the diplomacy of the United States.
The announcement was made last
week, and Dr. Williams spent the
week end preparing his address
of _prcsentaticn, which was, accord-
ing to Bernard Mclienn C39,
men’s debating manager, “a lit-
tle masterpiece of ambiguity, yet
in keeping with the great and
fundamental issues that were tied
up in the question concerned.”

“In these troubled times,” de-
clared Dr. William.s, “a scholar
is left out in the cold. The B. H.
Williams prize attempts to remedy
that condition. The candy bar
merely serves  a little symbol or
recognition.”

Dr. Williams, apparently choked
with emotion, was: unable to pro-
coed.

provided for the incorporation of la-

the incorporation on an entirely vol,-
untary basis. Esther Marcuson, C41,
was selected as secretary for this
committee by the executive director.

Some opposition to a provision re-

. ported by the Natural Resources com-

mittee was aroused in the Saturday
morning session because of its sup-
port of Government control and
ownership of the coal industry in the
state. The student assembly passed
the bill amid cries of “socialism.”

state revenue, namely, a personal in-

of Zr.-’.o12d.ay entitled “A Release from the Educators.”

t‘.riey had no ltnowleclge of any such manifesto, would
have sig'1.er.l it on the spot had they known. Whether
or ‘co’-7 such a petition reached the Un.Zve:'si.ty, we have
no way of knowing. It  directed inainly toward

but this is all beside the point. Vv'e still "think

Even with such things as inanifcstos and threats

degree of l1U.inifl.iz-3-tioz-.1, that we were quite interested in
the .re=.u.l‘s of last .‘Fri.da.y’s elections.

We were particularly engrossed in glancing through
a downtown paper the other day and reading the 5501116-

has no i.mmediatc political objjectives,
that its treasury is developed from
dues paid by members and not by l\/loscow gold.

The purpose of the club, as we understand it, is to
provide . . .

dollars for University dances, who are, in the main, un-
able to join fraternities, and who heretofore. operated

There is not written evidence to back this up. but it 
seems that in the spring, seniors succumb to a profound
nostalgia. Anyway, a few of us from the old freshman:
survey class four years ago were looking back, and to’

were nostalgic and lugubrious would
be no exaggeration of lac .

They were.

For the survey days were the

palmy days. There were about 30
of us, I believe. We went to the
ame classes tcgether, crammed to-
gather, dated together, and, with
typical freshman coclciness, believ-
ed that our professors were‘ the best
and that we were the finest people
who ever had anything to do with
the University.

It was a funny kind of education.
We were a little ashamed of it at first.
were enrolled in good, solid courses such as geology
and sociolcgy and introductory ethics; we were enrolled
in a nebulous creation called the “survey.”

,Landscape Paintings Featlwe

Latest Fine Arts Exhibition

By John Brosky

Striking characteristics of nature
with a strong rendering of atmos-
pheric effects describes the land-
scape paintings now being shown in
the University’s ﬁne arts gallery,

tinue until May 17, includes the

works of art by some of the greatest
F;.ench masters of the Barbizon
school during the 19th century. Bar-
bizon is affixed to certain landscape
painters who employed the same
technique and spent their life at the
French village of Barbizon.
NUTTALL IS OWNER

Owner of most of the paintings is
Richard V. Nuttall, one of Pitts-
burgh’s well known art collectors.
Other lenders are the Knoedler com-

pany, Dtirand-ll1.1el museum, and
Jacques Scligimann compan, Mrs.
William Stimmel. J:‘., museum of

modern art, and French art galleries.

The paintings do not create ex-
citement, but they do make the ob-
server feel a touch of Spring by the
cool, tranquil mood in which nature
is painted. C

ln the pastoral scene by Theodore
Rousseau, the great master in land-

-cra‘*es. there is a beautiful play of,
light on the leaves, and the tips of '

2p’;-cadi:.n.g branches have been done
with care.
 - RUIN SHOWS

fiT.xccll.cnt wok is shown in a por-
:"raiture cf a princess painted by Ma-
de: no Lo }3r1_i?n_. Corot is represented

.pa:'n.ti.n.<._: of a

pieces being displayed.

""l‘wili_ght” by Jules iDujore shows
how trees play a valuable part in the
decorative scheme of pictures. Cur-
bet was also a ﬁgure painter. His
painting of “Nordler, the Younger”
is  superb piece.

Some of the paintings are of the
Impressionistic school of art. Artists
in this ﬁeld include Troyon, Pissaro.
and Sisley.

Technical Staff Plays important
Part in Road Tour of ‘Brother Rat’

Thirty members of Pitt Players
presented , their hit production of
“Brother Rat” at three Ohio univer-
sities last week. Universities visited
included Denison university in Gran-
ville, Bowling Green State univer-
sity, and Ohio State university in
Columbus.

The traveling company included
not only the actors in the show, but
also a complete staff of technicians
and stage crew.

The truck which carried the equip-
ment and the sets for the play, and
the technical staff preceded the ac-
tors in order to unload and set up
the stage for each performance.

Under the direction of James Lind-
say, technical director, and John Mc-
Kee, assistant director, 11 students
erected the sets, fixed the lighting,
and did other phases of production
for the past month.

For this play, three sets of scenery
were prepared, and the barracks
scenes were exact duplicates of the
ones located at VMI. Plans for this
play also included one-minute scene
changes.
