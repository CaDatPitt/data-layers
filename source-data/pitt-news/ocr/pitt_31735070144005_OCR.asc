Candidates to form

slates,

SGB, page 1

Next month, Pitt students will be
able to vote for their picks online at the
mypittedu Web portal.

In the annual election, students can
vote for ﬁve board candidates and one
president, said elections committee
chair Patrick Moroney in an e-mail

To  to run, students must
have more than a 2.5 cumulative qual-

ity point average, a petitionwith 200 I

signatures and a statement about their
intention to run, as well as a longer
personal statement, said Moroney.

He said that although the deadline
to  out an election packet and turn
it in ended 5 pm. yesterday, the elec-
tion committee will accept late bids for
candidacy, as long as students get an
additional 200  and
why they were late

He said that these elections are im-
portant for all Pitt students, especially
student organizations, since SGB is
responsible for allocating about $2.4
million from the Student Activities
Fee to organizations throughout the
ﬁscal year

“If you don’t feel your group gets

run together

enough  or if your group

doesn’t get any money from the SGB, .

you should take this into consideration
when deciding to run or vote,” said
Moroney V

During the election, the candidates
will  allowed to form slates of three
For instance, two board member can-
didates and a presidential candidate, or
three prospective board members

Last year,  board members
Gary Sanderson and Lacee Ecker ran
with current president Sumterlink on
the‘ “Students First’ ’ slate

He said that the top eight vote—'

getting board member candidates and
the presidential nominee who gets the
most votes will form the 2009 SGB.

‘ ‘With the tight people in place, the
board has serious potential to improve

the lives of Pitt students,” said Mo-

roney.

Last  3,401 students out ‘of
17,246 eligible voterseundergraduates
not enrolled in the College of General

King said that the software veriﬁcation could have
happened two months ago through t:he National In-

“\X/hatyouarelookingatis stallanddelay,without

Kingsaidtha_tatestof18machinesis notenough

ingthe bestof ahorrible setup,” accordingto King

“In the big picture, these machines are not secur-
able,”  _

In addition to the extra precaution of the software
veriﬁcation, the County Elections Board took several
other precautions,  a mock election held on
all of the countyfs 4,700 machines held before Elec-
tion Day,  to Elections Board spokesperson
l\/Iankwolosile _

The CPA ﬁrm of Parente Randolph will also
come in on the Election Day and empirically test a
random sample of the machines to guard against
software  said \X/olosik.

Allegheny County is the only county in Pennsylvania
that does this, Evantr) said ' _

On Nov 4, the Elections Board-will also hand
count 2,000 votes and match them against the elec-
tronic results, according to Wolosik A

Evanto said, “We believe it is the right to do
and are conﬁdentin the security of the systern’ ’

Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in
2002 in response to the controversy over ballot count-
ing in Florida‘ during the 2000 presidential election
Part of the bill teqnites all 3,000 counties in the United
States to   an electronic voting system.

The states determine which systems meet the
standards of the act, and counties have the choice to
purchase any of the approved systems. Pennsylvania

is ﬁrlly compliant with the Help America Vote Act .

and certiﬁes the systems according to federal stan-
dards

Michael Shamos, a C1\/[U computer science pro-
fessor, is also an examiner of electronic  ma-
chines for the Pennsylvania Department of State He
examined and approvedin 2006 the Election Systems
& Software 1Votronic voting systemthat 

Countyis  this election

When Shamos submitted his report to the Penn-
sylvaniasecretaryof state,he saidthe systemwas
approved for use in Pennsylvania with certain restric-

tions Resnictions are normal, because manufacturers . vi 0
cannot design systems meant for use nationwide to .

adhere to the details of votinglawin all 3,000 counties,
 to Shamos ,

Of the 17 voting systems the Pennsylvania De-

= A A Election bureaus should
safeguard against. fraud 

A Allegheny County takes the ‘lead in .
A verifying polling equipment  

If there were a perfect system.
to assure every vote was counted
and every voting booth was
tamperproof, the states’ elections
bureaus would all adopt it.

But in the meantime,
Allegheny County is working
hard to make sure this year’s
presidential election is as fair
of a ﬁght as possible. The
county certiﬁed Monday that 18
electronic voting machines were
free from hacking and voter
fraud. ‘

' While the county didn’t begin

testing electronic voting software

_ until it received pressure from

various voters’ rights groups,

it was still the ﬁrst jurisdiction

to do so in the nation, The Pitt
News reported.

“We believe it is the right

thing to do,” said county

- spokesman Kevin Evanto, “and
we are conﬁdent in the security
of the system.”,

If only every voting precinct

AA A in the country would follow

suit. In an effort to encourage
all citizens to take part in the
3 democratic process of electing
I America political leaders,
advocacy groups and politicians
A alike remind us that every vote
counts.

D With Pennsylvania as
.a perennial swing state in

presidential elections, it’s
_ admirable that Allegheny

County has taken the initiative to
certify the accuracy of its voting
machines. .

haven’t

Election bureaus
always been this vocally
proactive.

In the 2000 election,
discrepancies over hanging

chads and butterfly ballots in
Florida brought into question
the accuracy of paper ballot
counting machines.

This year, we’re again facing

a hotly contested Election Day
where the race may be close 3
in states such as Florida, Ohio,
North Carolina, Nevada and A
Colorado. For that
jurisdictions across the nation
need to follow Allegheny ‘
County’s lead and verify the
security and accuracy of their
voting software. ‘ ’
President George W. Bush
won Florida in 2000 -——. and
subsequently, the election — by a
margin of 543 votes. Considering
how close presidential elections
have been‘ in recent years, one
rigged voting machine could.
make the difference in 2008. i
The ability of citizens to
choose their leaders is a point of :
pride that sets the United States’ j
political system apart from 1
countries with less freedomsand A
less—representative governments. I
But no matter A
idealistically fair and democratic ‘
our elections process is planned ~
to be, we can’t naively assume 3
that electronic voting machines 5
are infallible. M
When computerized vote— *~
counting practices can’t ensure .
that every vote will indeed be M
counted, election bureaus should ‘
double-check their accuracy to 
ensure fraud-free elections. , .
If Allegheny County wants to, 3
set an example in conducting fair ‘
and secure elecdons, it should
back up the voting machines
with an extensive paper trail. A A
And while we appreciate the 
county’s initiative, we’d feel more
secure if all voting machines were A
certiﬁed long ago, instead of just 

reason, 1

.months before this election.

At least Allegheny County A,
has made the effort. Let’s hope _
we’re protected against voting 
fraud elsewhere in the nation, 
where some counties are leaving ‘.0’:
it to luck.' A

Times are tough these days We’ve
all been pretty patient, but  are
slowly becoming more unreason-
able. The Economist ran a cover
story two weeks ago titled ‘‘\World
on . Edge,” addressing, among other
things, the need for personal cut-
backs. Among the losses included
in my recent restructuring program

are NFL Sunday Ticket and weekly

excursions to CD Warehouse If

us with an opportunity to do the one .A

thing our generation is best at: riot-

It’s not that we can’t be accommo-
dating when the time calls for it -—-
but we, speciﬁcally, are a generation

raised with rebellion ﬂowing through ' .

our veins. Our iconic forefathers are
Bart Simpson and Macaulay Culkin.
Unlike our predecessors from Gen-
eration X, we’re so impossible to
peg that we don’t even have a gen-
erational character assignment; We
drink Surge, ‘smoke  Blacks

and even partly remember the music
video for “Smells like Teen Spirit”

AWe’re just an antsy bunch by nature

- I personally got the fever in me

at a young age. After devoting hours _

on end to learning the guerilla tactics
used in “Home Alone,” I tried them
out on my extended relatives, with
mixed results. My mother would call
my days in elementary school 
I now cite them as the beginning of
my transcendental transformation.
By the ninth grade, I moved on to
the big leagues. When the United
Steelworkers went to Washington,
D.C., to insist on protecting domes-
tic production with increased tariffs,
I was there. I was there beside the
rugged factory workers and shrewd
union organizers chanting, “40 per-
cent for four _ years!” I was there
when President George W Bush
could no longer ignore us and came
out to announce that he’d do a com-
promise at 20 percent for two years

— or maybe just rescind the tariffs,

Living the 'American Dream‘ not exactly a dream

by Erik Hinton

Colunz/zidit

    
 

I detest the American Dream.
This is not because I love feudalism.
or rigid class structure. Truth be told,
myelanvitalissitrgularlyfedbytlre
principles of meritocracy. However,
as much as its fans would like to think

otherwise, the American Dream in

practice shares very little in common
with the American Dream in theory.
Envisaged as a philosophy in which
plucky Horatio Algers could become
presidents and doctors, the American
Dream plays out as a clever bit of

-sophistry to defend impropriety and

woo the public into accepting absurd
practices
Consider our current economic

'morass Many would point to the sub-

prime mortgage debacle as one of
the causes: folks buying homes they
cannot afford. Why would someone
spend like this? Well, the American
Dream of course If one is  out-
side of his means in a rigidly casted

society, he is a fools, strains on the so-
cial fabric, Balzac If one lives outside
their means in the American Dream,
though, he just.,“wants a piece of the
pie” We work  we deserve a

grandiose house with a white picket

fence and a yard in which all the chil-
dren —— that we are too busy to site
’." can P13)’-

Actually, you don’t; Promoting
home ownership for all as a logical and
desirable end of American achieve-

ment is dangerous No matter how_

much you work, you shouldn’t be able
to ﬂaunt an inefficient lifestyle and call
it a dream. If Joe, of plumbing fame,
cannot afford to buy the business into
which he poured  blood, sweat and
other liqueﬁed metaphors for ‘mas-
culinity, he should not buy it; Sadly,
America is convinced that not only
should he buy this business, but that
any ﬁnancial plan that would prevent
him from doing so is “getting in the
P way of the American Dream.” Please,
get in the way already.
This is only one example of many
of how popular Culture can takepoor

planning, slap a coat of American

A Dream on it and sell it back to Amer-

ica as a treasure Young Jeezy, rapper
extraordinaire, pumps his coffers ﬁill
of moneyiby  lyrics about get-
tingrichviaaddictivedrugs “]eezy the
snowman / I make it wintertime 
lot of dead white boyz equal money
in da bank” In less dreamy societies,
the Jeezy Snowman would be driven
out of town. Under the ever—loving
branches of the American Dream,
he’s rags to riches, just  his piece
of '_the pie

. How did it come to this? Language
is a Salome  for the head of
reason. Like so many other nuggets
of rhetoric, the American Dream was
introduced to language as a healthy bit

V of ideology, rosy—eyed with the prom-

ise of a truly capitalistic and demo-
cratic country. It rang out, ‘‘We can
change our lives” ‘
However, ever so  language
shifted and the American Dream
stopped  the potential for
success and started  the prod-
ucts of that success As soon as this

shift took place, the phrase got a carte
blanche to label  it pleased ‘as
part of this American Dream: light
colored fencing, impractical amounts
of money, owning a house, owning a
business, building a drug empire, etc
As no one wants to censure the origi-
nal spirit of the American Dream, no
one dares censure the new manifesta-
tion of it. 1

Therefore, we go along drunk on
this dream and gobble up mansions
and Mustangs Then, when our econ-
omy collapses we throw our hands up
like exasperated Fred Wﬂlards and ask,
_“Wha’ happened?” Reason lies decap
itated on a silver 

What we need to do is toss away
the American Dream. It is too corrupt '
— how many boys go to bed under
Scarface posters every night? — to be
salvaged Like all language that has lost
its way, it needs to be replaced before it
seduces anyone else Instead, we need
a phrase that doesn’t implicitly argue
thattobeagainstitis to be againstthe
country. ‘

I propose we change the ‘Amen-

can Dream” to the “Spirit of Mobili-
ty.” Precision of language is a wonder-
ﬁil attribute that prevents mythology

s from  rampant. It would re-

quire some serious sleight of hand to
argue that jeezy embodies the Spirit
of Mobility, such would be like saying
that burglary embodies the spirit of
capitalism

Furthermore, as the Spirit of Mo-
bility is just a spirit, it suggests that the
phrase is only a suggestion, a 
principle, but nothing set in stone
]oe’s entrepreneurship may be a great
instance of the Spirit of Mobility, but
that doesn’t mean it is practical. Amer-
ican reason can trump the Spirit of
Mobility. American reason stumbles
over the American Dream.

Nietzsche once -commented that
truth was “a mobile army of meta-
phors ...” Take this piece as a battle
cry against the seduction of American
Dream. Stop allowing rhetoric to con-
quer your reason with language Don’t
dream, reason. "

gods, with the scent of the Seahawks’
defeat fresh in the air. Rabid, towel-

 students spread to the streets

by the thousands and unleashed pure

insubordination. Business signs were '

smashed, cars ﬂipped over — I even
stood by without doing anything as
two rambunctious and unapologetic
youths ripped a parking meter right
out of the sidewalk. It was as if we
were  our voices as one: ‘‘\We
are only  to take so much of

oh, we won? Nice You still wanna

jump on the steps of the Cathedral
until they crack? Lets go!”

Now, they say, “One man alone is
not a rebellion,” and that is true. But
behind every great intellectual move-
ment there has been "a namesake, a
face to attach with the movement
—— Thomas Jefferson, Henry Da-
vid Thoreau, Kevin McCallister. We
need one man, or woman, who can
just get out there and rip it up, social
order be damned, and get the rest of
us behind them. It seemed to work
pretty well for Jerome Bettis when

he ﬁimbled against the Colts in the
AFC Divisional playoffs three years
ago, maybe we can get him back.
And as a veteran spokesman for the
“Campbell’s Chunky” soup lineup,
he’s got the leadership qualities that
we can all agree will help us  uh,
oh shit, what were we rioting about

Hasidic reggae artist turns from Phish to faith

by Justin Jacobs
Ac3E Editor

Matisyahu

Saturday, Oct. 25 .
Mr. Smalls, Millvale
8:30 p.m.
412-821-4447

If you know one thing about
Matisyahu, it’s probably that he’s a
Hasidic Jewish reggae artist.

But with a new, hip—hop ﬂa-
vored record about to dropearly
next year, which will likely push
him well into the mainstream,
you’re about to ﬁnd out a lot
more. -

One thing you probably didn’t
know, though, is that Matisyahu
wasn’t always who he is today In
fact, he was far from it — born
Matthew Miller in 1979, the future
Matisyahu didn’t grow up in syna-
gogue, he grewiup in the temple
of Phish, the Grateful Dead-like
musical trippers that gathered a
cultish following unlike few bands
before it.

“It was a combination of the
music and the lifestyle,” said Mati-
syahu in a recent interview with

H _The Pitt News. “That first Phish

show was a life—changing experi-

ence for me. I saw kids my age
who, all they did was chase the
experience. They weren’t bound
by school or parents. It was like
Never Never Land.”

Soon Matisyahu joined in the
chase, following his favorite band
on tour around the country. But,
as the story goes, he soon want-
ed more from life and fell into a

group of Hasidic (ultra-Ortho—’

dox) Jews in Brooklyn and em-
braced Judaism. In another rather
sudden move, Miller adopted the
moniker Matisyahu (a Hebrew
translation of Matthew, meaning
“gift of God”) and quit the Phish—
following altogether.

But music reared its head in
Matisyahu’s life before long, and
by 2004 he’d recorded his debut
reggae record, S/Jake of t/ye Dzm‘ 
Arise. Performing in full Hasidic
garb (long beard, prayer shawl
worn under clothing, all black-
and—white garments), he ‘was an
odd-duck among the highly'sexu-
alized contemporary music crowd
and quickly garnered mainstream
attention from both fans and the
press.

It’s an unusual story for a cer-
tainly left-of-center musician, but
it’s one that was so highly pub-

Hasidic Jew reggae artist Matisyahu tries to look tough for the camera, but we know he's try-
ing hard not to ‘smile behind that big bushy beard of his. O

licized, one’s got to wonder if it
overshadowed the music.

After all, a Hasidic Jew singing
reggae songs about God (often in
Hebrew) with a faux- amaican ac-
cent isn’t exactly commonplace on
the top 40.

But it’s a struggle Matisyahu is
willing to deal with in the name of
staying true to his faith.

“All too often, in a lot of towns
across America, being Jewish isn’t
something you’d want to put out
there. I came to the scene showing

that there was something truth— '

ful and real within Judaism,” said
Matisyahu. “That’s my inspiration,
so that’s what I put out there. In
that ‘sense, I feel good that people
can connect and open their eyes to

something they may already know
but couldn’t put their finger on.”

' \With his second record, Live
at Stubbfr, Matisyahu brought his
fusion of styles to a much wider
audience. The record’s first single,
“King Without A Crown,” was
picked up by radio stations all
across the country and played in
heavy rotation on MTV. Slowly,

The Jungle is coming out of

_ the basement and into the South
, Side.

Longtime Pitt student band
The Jungle, which was a house-
party staple when the members
were underclassman and has
since moved on to play at venues
like Oakland’s Peter’s Pub, is play-
ing at Club Cafe this Friday.

But for a venue best known for
quiet, singer—songwriter fare, The
Jungle might come as a shock ——
the band’s brand of groovy funk-
rock is more Black Crowes than
Sheryl Crow.

Made of singer and guitarist
Hans Lorei,’ lead guitarist Alex
Keirn, bassist John Bixby and
drummer Jay Maul, The Jungle
has been sharpening its funk as-
sault since before all of the now-

college seniors were even settling a

into their freshman dorms. And
since even then,‘ the band’s al-
ways been more than just another
gang of students playing classic
rock covers — a Jungle live show
features the full-tilt boogie-down
grooves of the band’s recorded

songs played with more energy
than the Oakland Zoo.

With opening spots from
Kansas and- Jefferson Starship
under its belt, as well as a new
EP produced by Phil Nicolo,
who’s worked on projects by Billy
Joel, Santana and The Police, the
band is primed to outstretch its
home in Oakland and truly make
a name for itself outside the col-
lege scene.

And Friday’s show is the be-
ginning-

“We’ll be playing a lot of
new material. It’s also the first
time we’Ve ever played the South
Side,” said Lorei. “It’s hopefully
the start of us. branching out of
Pitt’s campus into Pittsburgh.”

at the Southside Cinema last win-

Beliard called SafeRider, Pitt’s nightly on—call shuttle
The SafeRider dispatcher instructed Beliard and her friends

to cross the Hot Metal Bridge into Oakland, where 4

Beliard said she “wasted two hours of her life waiting on
SafeRider”

‘Tm glad I have a car now, so that I do not have to rely ‘

“The mission of SafeRider is to provide safe trans-
portation for students, faculty and staff to move about
campus when spedal, non—emergency needs arise,” said
Kent McGaughey, the manager of Transportation and
Travel atPitt

The shuttle service began as Van Call in 1992 and
operated for 11 years until it failed to meet its intended

safety mission and a student-led Transportation Committee _

redeﬁned the mission _

“Van Call was being used as a convenience and resem-
bled a taxi service,” said McGaughey. A

In August of 2003, Van Call became SafeRider.

The current SafeRider system runs throughout Oakland
and Chatham University, within the boundaries of Baum
Boulevard" on the north, Carnegie Mellon University on the
east, the Center for Biotechnology and Bioengineering on
the south and Trees Hall on the west;

Two vehicles run from 7:00 pm to 3:00 am Sunday

through Wednesday, and three vehicles run from 7:00 pm.
to 5:00 am. Thursday through Saturday nights.

While Devanath said that students still abuse the
SafeRider, McGaughey disagreed

“Some students just don’t understand what the system
is to be used for,” he said. “Students continue to expect
SafeRider to be a taxi service andefforts are  made to

emphasize that students should ﬁrst look to campus buses"

for transportation and that SafeRider is to assist people who
 themselves located off scheduled bus routes.”

Last spring, Devanath launched a  to bet-
ter inform students about SafeRider’s boundaries and
regulations and to obtain more phone lines and vehicles.
She coauthored the _manual “Helpﬁil Hints for Using
SafeRider’ ’ with Kent McGaughey, which details instruc-
tions on how to use SafeRider. '

The guide is currently available online, and Devanath

. said she expects that it will be published soon.

Many of the complaints McGaughey receives stem
from the call system

The former SafeRider communication system held
six callers at a time and disconnected additional-callers as
the amount of calls overloaded the System. The upgraded"
system no longer drops calls

Last year, the most calls came in on Thursday, Friday
and Saturday nights And on Saturday, the busiest night,
SafeRider picked up nearly 200 passengers »

“The challenge is to efﬁciently utilize available resources
to meet the demands of SafeRider,” said McGaughey.

Neighboring universities like Duquesne University have
established similar shuttie systems to meet the needs of the
campus. S

Duquesne University runs two shuttles on separate
routes Friday and Saturday nights during the school year.
The transportation company Express Shuttie owns the
vehicles and employs the drivers of the shuttles

Duquesne students placeicalls  to the cell phones
of the shuttie drivers to request rides at designated stops on
a route, called The Loop, along the South Side and through-
out the Downtown area, Oakland and the Waterfront

According to Andrew Hoover, Duquesne’s student

Devanath knows how it feels to be stranded in South

ride, the driver told her to make the call and wait;
While she waited on SafeRider that night, Devanath
decided that something needed to change. Since Devanath

SGB board member, she decided to attempt a reform of
SafeRider.

JUST IN IT FOR THE MUSIC

by Justin Jacobs
AC?9E Editor

Last Saturday, during an excursion to the
North Side, I found heaven. It was really
messy. It had a certain musk, too, and a great
jazz collection. It’s called Stedeford’s Record
Shop, and you should go. .

Like, now. You’re reading this in class right

now? No matter, you could learn more from

Stedeford’s than Intro to Whatever any day of
the week.

You see, Stedeford’s Record Shop is among A

a near—extinct breed of real record stores, with
vinyls piled up in every corner, CD and cas-
sette tapes lining the wall and employees who

In other words, it’s not FYE. Or Sam

Best Buy, W/al—Mart or any of the other giants
of shopping. In those stores, along with on-
line outlets like iTunes, music is a mere com-

one — stores like Stedeford’s, or ]erry’s in
Squirrel.Hill (one of the best collections of
vinyl’s anywhere, ever), are more about the ex-
perience of searching for records — ﬁnding

. new music, checking out theart, the lyrics, the

relation of one artist . to another, the move-
ment of music trends and the great sound of
a needle scratching a record — than anything,

else. And so these stores, while they certainly .
‘don’t have consumers streaming in like Circuit

City, have buyers who are loyal customers.

And don’t get me wrong —— while I’d love
to say I’m a local longtime customer at Sted-
eford’s, I know I’m just a kid who wandered
in. But there’s nothing wrong with that —— be-
coming a regular "could take months, and I’ll
be out of here come April.

The real record store, the cavernous,
wonderful beast that it is, is a dying breed.
Not only are people buying fewer albums,
but when they do, it’s more and more often
online. It seems the world has turned and
left Stedeford’s here, along with all the little
neighborhood record shops where the mys-
tery and aura of rock ’n’ roll still live. If that’s
an aura you dig, skip iTunes, skip Circuit City
and deﬁnitely skip Wal—Mart. Check out a lo-
cal record store.

But look through the Yellow Pages —— true
to form, Stedeford’s doesn’t even have a Web
site.
