National Education Legislation Passes

-By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer
Legislation establishing a new

"L U.S. Department of Education won

narrow approval by the House of
Representatives last week after
opponents of the bill had tried for
months to weaken it by adding
controversial amendments. ‘

The House approved a Senate-
House compromise of the legisla-
tion, 215 to 201, while the Senate
passed the bill 69 to 22 earlier in
the week.

Establishment of the 13th

Opposition to the bill in the
Senate was miniscule but in the
House, it was a different story. A

a number of liberal Democrats
joined forces to oppose the

Homecoming ’79: A Promise   e
New Improved Activities

By BOB WARMKESSEL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Homecoming Week starts Sun-
day at Pitt, and the organizers of
the week-long activities guarantee
a ‘.‘new and improved” set of
events.

“We think this year’s Home-
coming co-chairperson, shares
DiMaccio’s sentiments and added,
“Spirit—that’s our main goal for
Homecoming this year.”

Roslyn Moncini, also Home-
coming co-chairperson, sentiments
and added, “Spirit—that’s our
main goal for Homecoming this
year.” '

The theme of this year’s
Homecoming Week festivities is
“Here’s to Pitt: I Love You
Pittsburgh.”

“The media, city organizations,
and other parts of the community
have all given us a lot of help in
planning Homecoming,” said
Moncini. “That’s why we decided

to-' include the city name in the
theme.”

After a student leadership dinner
kicks off homecoming activities
Sunday, the festivities spread
throughout the campus on Mon-
day. At that time, the voting for
Homecoming King and Queen will
take place. There will be five
locations on campus to cast ballot.

When students go to vote, they
will receive the homecoming
program and a brand-new in-
novation—the “horrible hanky.”
The “janky,” which was partially
funded by Stroh’s Brewing
Company, is a blue and gold
handkerchief which students are
urged to bring———and wave——at
Saturday’s football game.

“It’s important that everyone
who comes to the game brings their
hanky,” said Moncini. “It’s a way
that everyone can show‘ their
(school) spirit.”

Two new events will highlight
Tuesday’s homecoming .agenda.

One event, the premiereof the play
“Leave it to Jane,” will be

' presented by Studio Theatre in the

basement of the Cathedral at 8
p.m. The other new event,
“Oakland Night at the Bars,” takes
place from 7 p.m. to closing at six
area taprooms. Reduced prices for
drinks will be given to bar patrons
who wear Pitt T-shirts.

DiMaccio and Moncini promise a ‘

new-look homecoming carnival on
Wednesday night in the Quad.
In addition to food, games, and

amusements; a local disk jockey’

will spin records and put on a light
show, and the announcement of
Homecoming King and Queen will
be held. \

‘ Many of Friday’-s events ae also
brand-new or revised. On Friday
afternoon on the Cathedral lawn,
an Almost Anything Goes/ Keg Roll
will take place. Forty-eight teams
will compete on an obstacle course

including such events as a keg roll, ‘
_a grease’ slide,» and a sack race.

ally and supporter of liberal causes
in the past.

In order to arrouse wide
opposition to the new department,
opponents of the legislation offered
ammendments which would:

—Make one of the purposes of
the department to allow voluntary
prayer in public schools,

—-—prohibit the department from
mandating public schools to bus
students in order to achieve a racial

balance,

4not allow racial quotas to be
used in making admissions deci-
sions, and,

—prohibit the use of department

facilities by colleges and universi-
ties who use mandatory student

fees to pay for abortions, except in _

the case where a mother’s life is in
danger. ‘

The amendments nearly cost the

._ bill its life, but many of its original ‘

supporters voted to send the _bill to
a House-Senate conference
committee hoping the committee

members would drop the contro-  

versial amendments.

Once the bill cleared the"A

conference committee, minus the

amendments, passage of the 

legislation was assured. -

Practical Experience:

Path to Job Opportunity  

~ By CINDY HECKATHORN
Pitt News Staff Writer

On-the-job experience can be a
student’s most valuable asset when
entering the job market according
to several successfully employed
Pitt graduates. ‘

Most of the former students
found their experience helped them
apply classroom knowledge to life
situations, and to make important
contacts with prospective employ-
ers.

Tammy Haddad interned at
KDKA-TV for two terms before
landing her current job as
production assistant for Pittsburgh
Today, a KDKA-TV afternoon talk
show. —

As an intern, Haddad did not get
paid, but earnedecollege credits.
After her internship period was
over, she was hired for her current
position. Her duties include

Q writing scripts, booking guests,

and briefing talent. In addition,
Haddad is a part-time producer for
KDKA radio"s Perry Marshall
Show. ‘ "
“Most of the people hired at
KDKA were previous interns,”
Haddad said. She said her
internship allowed the manage-

ment at KDKA to see that she was ,

“dedicated and enthusiastic.’ ’

Members of Lamda Kappa Sigma Pharmacy Fraternity held its Fall term

Although Haddad learned of the
open internship position at KDKA
through -a friend, she said that
internships can be found if a
student is motivated enough to look
for one. ' v P

“If you want an internship, write

to the person in charge.-—the~“ 3
general manager or whatever, and 2’,
follow it up with a phone call,” '

Haddad said.

Many services exist within the A A A A

university to help students locate

career—related internships and _»
temporary jobs. ' - i .

Pitt’s Internship Office, located a
on the second ﬂoor of the Student 
find 

Union, helps students
positions in areas they're interest-
ed in. Brenda Manning, coordi-_
nator of the Internship Office said

that internships offer vstudent's‘~ 

many benefits.

“The most obvious way way "it

said. “Anything that you can put

The intern period can give
students an indication if they

would like to continue in a field -

the right major,” Manning said.

Some 500 high school students
from the tri-state area were on
hand yesterday for the annual

light of National Yearbook Week.
“What is a Yearbook?” was the

theme stressed throughout the
day’s agenda, which included
guest speakers and a variety of
workshops.

Speaking at the morning intro-

the most important aspect of any
yearbook. _

“Memories make each yearbook
unique,” Howell said. “Twenty
yearsifrom now you will pick up
your yearbook and say, ‘That is
how it really was’.’’ 5

He also emphasized looking at
everyday occurrences as memories.

“What happens in the lunch-
room and on buses daily are a big
part of student life,” he said.

“There is more to a lot of events:
A than meets the eye.”

“These are memories that might
be worth capturing,” he added.

The afternoon was devoted to
small workshops covering topics

"ranging from‘ design to photo-

graphy to advertising.

Abe Orlick of Davor Photography
Inc. said, “You are working on the
ﬁrst book of the 80s, and you will
set standards for that decade.

“As photographers your aim
should be to make time stand
still,” he added.

Davor is the company respon-

»sible for senior pictures for the

The event, co-sponsored by the A
Owl and Herff Jones Yearbooks, g

also included speeches by teacher-

author Dr. Mary Raye Denton and .

several other prominent national
yearbook authorities.

Working in a professional

atmosphere can also give students '

conﬁdence, Manning said.

“Just knowing how to act, what
to say, how to dress and what
people feel is important.”

“Students always say ‘I want to
be a professional.’ You can’t get

to fit into an organization,”
Manning said.

future reference are another

said.

Pearson began as promotions

Legal Awareness Lends Aid to Student-landlord Problems

By ROBIN LUB_IC ‘
Pitt News Staff Writer

Seminars usually inform but
rarely do much to entertain. That
wasn’t the case Monday, though,
when an undercover man and wife
landlord team attended the Legal
Awareness Committee’s seminal:
on tenants’ rights.

Committee chairperson Josie
Gagliardi said the couple, dressed
in trenchcoats and allegedly
carrying hidden tape reéorders,
approached her, apparently trying

to test the legitimacy of the

“The woman wanted to know
what she could do about getting
back her son’s security deposit
from his old landlord. Then the
woman started‘ quoting figures
which were exactly like a case
which we have been working on,”
said Gagliardi. A

The woman seemed to be trying
to encourage Gagliardi into giving
out legal advice, which Legal
Awareness Committee members

are not qualiﬁed nor permitted to

“I told her to have her son come
in with his lease -and whatever
other papers he had and meet with
our attorneys at four o’clock today.
The woman made the excuse her
son was out of town, so neither him
nor his roommates could be
reached,” said Gagliardi.

“The woman left completely
unsatisﬁed that I didn't tell her to
sue. After she left,- someone told
who she and her husband were,”
she added. A

Security deposits, sums of

money paid to landlordsin advance
to cover damages after a tenant
moves out of his/_her apartment,
was one of the main topics
discussed at the seminar.

“Security deposits are the
biggest problem. at this time
because most leases ran out
August 31 and by the Landlord-
Tenants Act of 1951, the deposits
should be paid back in full or in
part within 30 days,” said Glenn
Meyer, Legal Awareness Commit-
tee Researcher. _

“Here it's October and still no
money,” he added.

TUCK SCHOOL

A Top Graduate School
of Business in Hanover,
‘ . New Hampshire!

Tuck School -is living proof that a leading
business school need not be located in a
big city. While Executives-in-Residence
and other representatives of the.business
community form a steady stream of
visitors to the School, Tuck students -
enjoy the fine facilities of Dartrﬁouth
College in a beautiful New England set-
ting. The problems of city life can\be put
aside, at least temporarily, in favor of
academic concerns.

Murdough Center, built in 1973, provides
modern classrooms, a 358-seat audi-
torium, and the excellent services of
Feldberg library. Adjoining Murdough
Center is the rest of the Tuck complex:
three dormitories, Stell Dining Hall, and
Tuck Hall, where faculty and administra-
tive offices and additional classrooms are
housed. These, together with the cultural
and recreational facilities of Dartmouth
College and its environs, make the Tuck
'~: School attractive to students, faculty,
and visitors alike. ’

During the past year more than 190 com-
panies sent representatives to Tuck. to
recruit from its 135 graduating students.
(A Placement Report is included in the
Tuck Bulletin.) And, each year 25 man-
agers from industry come to Career
Expo, a two-day symposium, to share
their knowledge and experience in their
respective fields. Numerous guest
speakers participate in the classroom
throughout the year, and distinguished

Government Board face the difficult problem of fin-
ing the best time when the seven members can come
together for a meeting. Like most students trying to
attend classes, study and have some social life, their
time is limited, so finding a convenient meeting time
is difficult. But the members should be willing to
sacriﬁce time for student government, since all
voluntarily ran for office.

The attitude demonstrated by the board with such
late meetings seems to be one of permanent concern
for themselves and little for those elected them, a
view more appropriate for aristocrats than for
student representatives. . '

The decision to hold meetings late in the evening

shows at least somemembers of the board are not ‘

willing to make that sacrifice, and students who have
the right as voters to attend these meetings are the
people who suffer the most. Commuters, who make
up more than 50 percent of Pitt's population, are
denied the chance of attending the metings unless
they inconvenience themselves severly by waiting un-
til after their afternoon classes to come to the
meeting, and then by traveling home by bus or car at
9 or 10 p.m. ‘ -

In this case the situation is even more deplorable
because the board is holding meetings late at night
mostly to accommodate one member, Tom Kunkel.
Kunkel has been unable to attend afternoon meetings
because he has labs and other classes to attend, and
also plays on the soccer team, which practices during
the afternoon.

Page 6-Friday, October 5, 1979

Kunkel’s reasons might be excusable if he attended
the meetings and contributed to the public work of
SGB, but Kunkel has missed all or part of the last
two evening meetings. One he missed because of a
soccer game, the other he arrived late because he was
having his picture taken as ,a candidate for
homecoming king. _

“Both are actually pre-board things,” Kunkel told
the Pitt News. “I played soccer long before I was on
the board...What can I tell my coach; and I start and
everthing.” But Kunkel also added: “Even if we got
only five or six members of the board together for an
afternoon meeting, it would be better than a night
meeting.”

It is absurd for the student government to be ad-
versely affected because one person, who originally
showed the willingness to sacrifice his time for his
fellow students, has found he no longer can find the
time at attend SGB meetings at a reasonable hour.
It also clashes with the democratic principles on
which the board is based. .

To correct the problem and return some semblance

of a republic spirit to the working of SGB, meeting
/should be scheduled during the afternoon, when all
students, commuters and residents alike, can attend
the sessions convenientlyif they wish. If any member
of the board has a problem committing one after-
noon a week so that meetings can be held at a time
that allows maximum attendance, perhaps I that
member should consider resigning from their
positon. ’

Reader: Food Service from Mediocre to Bad in 4 Years

Finally. a group of Pitt students
has gathered together to try to do
what the student Food Committee
could‘not: improve the quality of

‘ the food service in the residence

hall cafeteria.
Ted Kokladas,, manager of the
cafeteria, wonders why students

‘are enraged so early in the year.

As a. senior, I have watched the
food in the cafeteria go from
mediocre to unbearable, and the
repetitious serving of veal was the
straw that broke the camel's back.

Mr. Kokladas also said the the
student had not had enough time

, to, “have a real feel for the food."

If the management admits the food
has to be gotten used to. then there
surely must be something wrong.

But to find the real truth, all you
have to do is ask the students about
their experiences in the cafeteria,
and you will get the whole story.

Personally. I have found bones,
hair,'and bugs in my food. Now I
approach a meal as a box of
Cracker J ack——the first thing I do is
check inside for the prize!

Still the food service defended
the quality of the food in The Pitt

» _ News on Sept. 28. This was not to

s.

reassure the students, but to
reassure the people in the
Cathedral that everything is O.K.

The food service is trying to
downplay this, but if 1200 students
are dissatisfied, there certainly
must be something wrong. My
only hope is‘ that things will not
take their usual slow pace, and
something will be done before
April.

No More
AP Please

I'm tired of seeing very little
campus news in the Pitt News, so I
decided to take a look at it. The
October 3 issue stacks up this way:

Pitt News Articles: 3 for 27%
column inches.

Associated Press Articles: 6 for
94% column inches.

No credit shown (not local
stories): 3 for 33 column inches.

A mere“21% of the news is

campus news! The other four-
ﬁfths is readily available from other
sources. Idon't want to see in the
“official student newspaper” the
same news that local papers, radio
stations, and television stations
have covered more quickly and
efficiently.

There are exceptions to the rule
of covering only campus news, of
course. The annual budget debate
in Harrisburg. which determines
how much support Pitt gets is such
an exception. In those cases, I’d
like to see interpretive stories
which tell the effect of the event on
students. I don't want to see
Associated Press copy—EVER!
This is supposed to be a student
paper-so give us news for
students!

There is a good side to ‘our
paper.’ Sports is coverd well. In
the October issue sports came out
ahead of news:

Pitt News Articles:
column inches.

Associated Press Articles: 2 for
39 column inches.

Why can't news be covered as
well as sports? I'd like to see the
Pitt News’ budget in a future issue.

5 for 66

I think students would find it an
interesting story. How much
money goes for the AP machine
which-you seem to depend on too
much? How much is the News
paying its staff? It will un-
doubtedly surprise some students
to see that writers are paid. Per-

haps that information will attract
more people to your staff...people
who are sorely needed, from the
appearance of the paper.

‘ about a national championship...

After a Major Change and National Championship...

This is the first of a two-part series on Pitt football
during the reign of coaches Johnny Majors and
Jackie Sherrill. Today’s column deals with their
coaching strategies.

As Pitt enters tomorrow’s game with Eoston
College, there exists a general feeling of disappoint-
ment over the Panthers’ less than inspiring play un-
der the guidance of Jackie Sherrill. ..

Many fans (students and alumni) are after
Sherrill’s neck. They feel the man who inherited an

undefeated national championship team has let them

   

After the Major change in Pltt football brought
down. More and more fans are upset because John-
ny Majors, the smooth talking wheeler-dealer, left
Pittsburgh to coach at his alma mater, Tennessee.

Just how crippling was the loss of Johnny Majors?

’ And is Jackie Sherrill capable of taking Pitt back to
A the top of the heap?
What follows is a closer look at the principals, ‘

Pitt fields a football team for many reasons, the
most important of which—to the school’s ad-
ministration—yield publicity and money at a univer-
sity whose need for each is substantial.

The more common level of interest is that of Pan-
ther followers who seek amusement and entertain-
ment.

4 Pitt’s current football fortunes—the Panthers,
who aspire to produce top-level football, are not
ranked and do not deserve such honor—have not
much affected the corporate aim. Though inﬂuential
backers are grumbling, Pitt still sports a big-league
program of which such contributors will pay to be a
part. There is no problem here-—yet.

But to those who seek simple amusement, the re-
cent and accelerating decline of Pitt’s football
program is no longer cause for the friendly debate
that makes sport such a popular pastime. Panic isn’t
necessary-—a game and not nuclear war is being
discussed—but cause for concern has been found at
Pitt Stadium since the Panthers returned ‘from fall
camp. ‘

‘ The Panthers no longer have the awe-inspiring
ability that once (thrice?) made them superior to

 nearly every team in the nation. The few outstanding

performers Pitt has not lost to professional team,

A graduation and other colleges often are misused by

current Pitt plans and. the record—four loses last
season and the three-game 1979 start that includes an
embarrassing loss and an equally embarrasing win at
Temple.

It would not be fair to take that evidence and con-
clude the Panthers are on the descending side of the
rollercoaster track that took them to the top. But it is

' obvious Jackie Sherrill must make some tough-to-

50.: «

Sports Talk

By SAM SCIULLO

  

Majors and Sherrill, from an observerwho has seen
every Pitt home game since 1966, and who has more
than a casual fan’s knowledge of how the Pitt foot-

1 ball program has suffered, prospered and been pam-

pered by fans, administrators, coaches and players.

Johnny Majors accepted the Pitt job in December
1972. When he came to the Steel City, he hit the
hungry Pitt fans like a storm, preaching Pride and
Enthusiasm and shaking more hands than a presiden-
tial candidate. Make no mistake about it, a football
coach needsto' be a politician, and Majors’ rapport
with fans and writers was a thing of beauty from Day
One.

Majors and .his staff, led by his number one «

assistant, a rugged fellow named Jackie Sherrill, em-
barked on an extensive recruiting campaign which
brought approximately 70 new players to Pitt for the
start of the 1973 season. Among that group were
many outstanding players, including Tony Dorsett

(recruited primarily by Sherrill), Gary Burley, Don’

Parrish, Jim Corbett, Carson Long and Al Romano.

/ Pitt finished 6-5-1 in 1973, which had to be con-
sidered a success, because Pitt’s last winning year had
been 1963. The Panthers were finally defeating
teams which had consistently clobbered the Panthers
in previous years. And Majors and Dorsett were hot
items in Pittsburgh.

One of the major criticisms of Jackie Sherrill has
been that he can’t win the Big Game. This may be
true, but Majors didn’t.beat a good team until his
third year at Pitt, when the Panthers whipped Notre

-Dame asDorsett rushed for .303-'yards.: ~ . .- -V J 
If Majors was such a shrewd judge of talent, why

was Matt Cavanaugh a second-string quarterback at
the start of his junior year? Had it not been for a
knee‘ injury to Robert Haygood, Cavanaugh
probably would have been nothing more than that, a
second-string quarterback.

But 1976 was the year Pitt was gunning for.
Sherrill had since departed, taking the head coaching

a job at Washington State. Everyone knows what Pitt

tackle decisions soon if the uncertainty enveloping
his program is not to lead Pitt to a plunge.

Jackie Sherrill is a good man who represents his
school well. He even, at times, appears to care about
items other than 40-yard dash times,_ height-weight
tables and won-loss records. The belief here is that
Sherrill may come out of his programfs recent slip,
and guide Pitt through some fine seasons of football.
The fact on which his future rests is that he must
begin more-productive decisions before and during
the games he seeks to win. ,

Sherrill was the foundation‘ on which John Majors’
Pitt-pushing success was built. He was the finest
assistant coach in the country, a man to whom
players looked for the certainty and reassurance
necessary to the winning attitude Pitt once could
claim as a weapon. It is difficult to imagine who has
taken his place at Pitt. ’

Sherrill appears to panic during important games .

when his team falls behind; this is natural, since Pitt
chronically has relied on its defense and since its
current and acute offensive slump threatens to crip-
ple the team. He first seemed to respond to
fright—instead of with confidence, logic and a
knowledge of his team and its opponent——when Pitt
fell behind Penn State at the Stadium during the Nit-

tany Lions’ 15-13 1977 win. He last seemed to aban-
4 (Continued on page 9) '

accomplished in 1976, and when Majors announced
his intention to go to Tennessee, Sherrill was almost
immediately named as his successor.

Sherrill was welcomed back with open arms. At
Golden Panther meetings, he was cheered en-

» thusiastically by the same people who now want him

fired. , ‘

So, a new era in Pitt football was set to begin on a ‘ 

clear September day in 1977 at Pitt Stadium. Pitt was
defending its national championship against’ Notre
Dame. Missing were a few key players’ who had
played important roles for the 12:0 squad, including
starters such as Dorsett, Long, Larry Swider, Jim
Corbett, John Pelusi, George Messich, John
Hanhauser, Romano, Don Parrish,_Cecil Johnson,
Ed Wilamowski, Arnie Weatherington and Jim
Cramer.
’ But that was nothing to be concerned about. Pitt
fans believed all they had to do was show up, remind
everyone that “Pitt is It” and remember past vic-
tories to carry the Panthers to another undefeated
season. _

Then Matt Cavanaugh broke his wrist, and
everyone blamed Sherrill because there weren’t any
adequate backups. Pitt fans thought their’ team

should have beaten Notre Dame without Cavanaugh.

but all the preparation in the world couldn’t have
made up forlthe unbelievable difference in ability
between Cavanaugh and the next man in line.

So while Pitt followers were blaming everyone and
his brother for the loss ‘to Notre Dame, nobody
remembered the role Majors might have played. Af-
ter all, he failed to recruit a major college quarter-

back to Pitt after his second year. He even turned '

down.a Sto Rox quarterback named Chuck Fusina,
who went on to beat Pitt three out of four times while
he played for Penn State. “ ‘ -
The message is this: although the Pitt team ap-
pears to be slipping, there is no reason for a major

shake-up, lespecliallynowl. Sherrill seems to have the«-

horses to be a big winner. Tomorrow, he will get one
more chance to juggle the lineup. Will he go with the
veterans, or with his fairly large group of promising

. newcomers? .

Booters Fiainon Union  

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer I
After Tuesday’s win over Mt.
Union College, the Panther soccer

team may be ready to employ an

old Indian rain dancer. When it
rains it pours, and when it pours
the Panthers seem to play better

- soccer.

Pitt (1-4-2) has been consistently
successful in the rain. The two
Panther ties came on wet Pitt
Stadium turf against Slippery Rock
(3-3) and Eastern powerhouse
Temple (0-0), and the team’s first
win (2-0) was played on a very
soggy,-muddy Mt. Union ﬁeld. -

Pitt went in to the contest against
undefeated Mt. Union without the
services of ace sweeper back Tom
Liebenguth. Liebenguth, who was

‘ out with the flu, was replaced by

freshman Karl Heimback. Heim-
back looked good in his first start in
the Panther defensive unit.

Also putting in a ﬁne perfor-
mance on defense was Jerry
at outside fullback.
Tomasetti hustled throughout the
game and controlled the ball many

times to prevent Mt. Union from"

scoring.

Although the two teams battled
to a 0-0 halftime score, the initial 45
minutes of play did not lack

A excitement. The Panthers took 15

shots on goal and held the
opposition to only four. Slide
tackling, ‘led by midfielder Danny

'Hamm, was in prime form. on the

slippery grass ﬁeld. Also, the

referee saw ﬁt to hand out his first
yellow card warning to Panthers’
midfielder Al Adelmann. Adel-
mann was reprimanded midway
through the first half for voicing his

-opinion on the ﬁeld.

‘The Panthers opened up scoring
at the 14 minute mark of the second
half. Adelmann let his foot do the
talking this time around as he
passed the ball to teammate Bob
Hughes. Hughes then placed a
perfect shot into the net for the
ﬁrst Pitt goal. Two _minutes later,
Hughes once again put the ball
past the Mt. Union goalkeeper, but
the goal was erased; Hughes was
called offside before the play.

The Panthers showed they
weren’t about to settle for only one
goal when Jeff Tissue scored his
third goal of the season. Tissue
received a pass from his right wing
Olabode Anise and took the ball in
for the score. The Panthers were
on top to stay, 2-0.

Although the rain‘ stopped
midway through the second half,
the yellow cards kept on coming.

Pitt fullback Jim Hackworth was-

given a yellow card, and the entire
Pitt bench was given a warning for
their overly enthusiastic conduct.
The only threat by Mt. Union
was on a shot that crossed the ﬁeld
and came within inches ofthe goal
net. Pitt defender Tom Kunkel
came- from his outside fullback
position to clear the ball from the
Panther goal. His ﬁne perfor-
mance helped Panther goalkeeper

Mark Robertson secure his shutout
and become the ﬁrst to record a win
in goal.

The Panthers, after this initial
victory of the season, "still believes
they can salvage a successful
season from the contests that
remain on their schedule.

“-That ﬁrst win, even if it was a
little later than we had hoped, still
did wonders to boost our conﬁ-
dence,” said Adelmann. “What
we need now is to keep that
conﬁdence growing and put things
together like we did on, Tuesday
and we can keep on winning.
Against Bucknell tonight we should
fare very well——I’m sure we can
have another sin-.”

If the Panthers keep on winning, A

they can still come up with a
successful record. There are eight
games remaining, which provides
the Panthers with more than ample
time to redeem themselves.

‘There’s no place for the booters to

go but up, and against Bucknell

tonight they hope to move up the-

ladder.

yet to give his team, his fans and -—-perhpaps—himself

any reason to hold enthusiasm for either of Pitt’s .-

quarterbacks. The decision seems simple—stay with
Rick Trocano, who is competent but who never will
become an outstanding major-college quarterback
counted on to lead his team past any obstacle, or
switch to Dan Marino, who someday will be the Pan-
ther passer, but who may not yet be ready to make
the best of his spectacular talent. A .
There are other personnel problems—the team's‘

best sprint runner, J o] 0 Heath, plays defensive back;

its best receivers rarely have been targets; its long-
awaited big back is not being (employed often; and
few players are secure in first-string status’. Pitt

seems to have _more than enough runners, kickers,

throwers, catchers and tacklers who might be ableto
do the job but no,one who is trusted to perform. .

This has led to a recent past that is less than glori-
ous and a potential future that may be worse. Sher-
rill must (and can) grab his program, set its aim
straight. and accomplish this soon because Pitt will
panic once the program's backers do; as has been’
shown on the football field, fright-fueled action

rarely scores. . »
And since neither casual'fan nor contributor nor

television audience wishes to watch a team that can’t_ A
score, Pitt would do well its currently available '
