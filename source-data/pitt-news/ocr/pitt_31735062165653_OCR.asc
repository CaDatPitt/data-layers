spring trimesters, yet we are now
receiving more from just the fall
trimester,” stated Miss Kimel.

By BARBARA LANGE
Anthony P. Athens, assist-

: ant registrar, reports that re-

gistration is coming along
very well, but that total stu-
dent registration will not be
known until students have
their tuitions or made partial pay-
ments on the deferred payment
plan.

Mr. Athens said, “We have no
complaints and hope that most
students share our feelings.” Ac-
cording to him, most of the lines
have resulted from the many stu-
dents seeking changes in courses.
He reminded that all course
changes must be completed by
January 12.

Opinions Mixed

Students had mixed opinions
about registration. Most felt that
it was a waste of time and temper;
only a few felt that most of the

confusion was the result of stu-

dent error.

An unidentiﬁed night school
student who was adding two
courses said disgustingly, “After
three years at a small college
where everything was done for
me, I feel that this procedure
is'a real waste of time and red
tape.” ,

William Einhorn, liberal arts
ireshman, feels that registering
and changing courses is very in-
,eﬂ‘icient——especially when it takes
four hours just to change the time
of the course. “It’s stupid to wait

in line for hours just to see your
faculty advisor,” he added.

More Help Needed

Terry Holder, pre-med sopho-
more, commented that a lot of
time could be saved if the Office
of Student Records would put on
more help during these rush per-
iods.

Marcelline George, liberal
arts freshman, and Robert Bran-
denstein, engineering senior,
were among those with favor-
able comments. Miss George
believes that “for a big school
the University does well for as
many people as thev have to
handle.” Brandenstein said that
registration is much more effi-
cient than two years ago.
,iAthens stressed the fact that

much confusion could be elimi-‘

hated if students would take ad-

vantage of the registration—by-
mail service when possible.

Circle K‘ Presents

Semiformal Ball

The Circle K Club of the Uni-
in conjunction with the
Kiwanis and Circle K clubs of

"Division "six, Pennsylvania Dis-

trict, willisponsor a semiformal
ball in January 12, 8:30 p.m., in
the Student Union Ballroom.
Dick Nichol’s five piece combo,
and hypnotist Elliott Brodie will
be featured. A limited number of
tickets at $2.50 per couple are
available at the student desk in
the Cathedral of Learning.

THE FACULTY at Muskingum
College recently approved the
adoption of new attendance
regulations, allowing the indi-
vidual professor to determine
his policy on attendance re-
quirements.

Annual Report

Deadline Nears
“All foreign students and visi-
tors on non-immigrant visas in
the United States are required
to ﬁle an annual report card, be-
tween niw and January 31,” Miss»
Renee Lichtenstein disclosed.
“The cards are available at all
post ofﬁces and must be handed
in to the post oﬁice, they must
not bemailed. Any foreigner fail-
ing to fill, and ﬁle. the cards be-
fore the due date face action by

She also requested that all the
students let her know about their
address change since last term’
and also give her a copy, of their
class schedule this term.

Miss Lichtenstein said that

ing foreign students will be held
early next week. The final date

nounced as yet.

bers—in—course ‘to their chapter, the Xi Chapter‘ of Pennsyl-

vania.

They also elected two honorary and two alumni

members. The tapees will be initiated at a special ceremony
January 18, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the

Chapter. 9

Seven of the students elected
graduated at the end of last tri-
mester, two will graduate in
April, and the other two in Au-
gust. ‘

Graduates

Those who graduated are Irene
Epstein, Rochelle Braunstein,
Robert 1. Davis, Allen Schweins—
berg, George Myters, Jonathan B.
Towne, and Leland McKeever.
Graduating‘ this term are George
Kukich and George Doschek. The
August graduates are Mrs. Joy
Ane Lindau‘er and Robert Baloh.

Emily Irvine, professor of‘
English at the University, and

John K. M. Tibby, Jr., editor
of Sports Illustrated and asso-’
ciated with Time, Life, and

Fortune Magazines, were elected

alumni members. “Herman Hail-

perin, Rabbi of the Tree of Life .

Congregation, and Mrs. Agnes

Turnbull, a novelist," are the
' new honorary members.

Each chapter is allowed to elect
a certain per cent. of. the gradu-
ating class, according to Profes-
sor Lawrence Lee, president of
the University chapter. Students
usually have a 3.5 QPA or over
and they are predominantly in
the School of‘ Liberal Arts, Lee

- Recognizes Values
“Phi Beta Kappa is not meant
to separate one man orswoman
from his fellow students, but it
is meant to recognize early de-
votion to issues and values larger
than the self and to support such
unselﬁsh moral and intellectual

dedication,” Lee stated. _

Six alumni and three hon-
orary members may be elected
in a three year period. “From
the beginning Phi Beta Kappa
has initiated alumni thought to '
have achieved distinction" and
certain honoraries not members
of the institution,” Lee con-
tinued.

Tibby was elected on the basis

on his intellect contributions in

American society both in war and
peace. He served as a naval rep-
resentative on one of the highest
boards in the European theatre
and/also helped setup the Gallop
poll. '

. ‘A literary ﬁgure, Mrs. Turn-
bull has written novels which
give a wholesome insight into the
American Isociety, "according to
Lee. She was elected for her in-
tellectual qualiﬁcations and very
affectionate interest in America as
represented by the Pittsburgh
area.

“Miss -Irvine, is one of the

_most successful professors here.

' She is an", excellent teacher, is

‘in the finest student organiza-

tions, and gives great encour-

agement to the better student,”

Lee stated. ,“We felt her liter-’
ary devotion should be recog-

nized.”
A man of great force in the

community and throughout Juda-

ism, Dr. Hailperin, as a scholar,

has contributed tolChristian-Jud-

aic relations, Lee explained. He
was chosen for his.moral and

' literary character.

cigarette advertisementssimilarly banned from The Pitt

C The Health Director’s latest step has been to inspire
— and/or join the University’s Auxiliary Enterprises officials
 _in a campaign to place “thought-provoking messages” on all
2‘ the cigarette vending machines and sales counters on

_ These signs, according to John Langstaff of Auxiliary
Enterprises, which are now being printed and will be dis-
; played “in about ten days,” will warn customers that the

Thompson, who conducted a survey of numerous Amer-
ican college administrators last year to determine what
their policies toward student smoking were and found that
most of them had none, fully supports the vending machine
‘scare stickers. He states that it has been done at other

sity.” ,
Langstaff, however, reports that similar attempts were
, made in several cities in England and while_cigarette con-
sumption dropped off for a short period of time, sales soon
, returned to normal, as the effect of the warning signs ap-
parently lost its strength.

‘ It is felt here that the vending machine signs would
not be a very effective means to discouraging cigarette
smoking. In the first place, the signs would be reaching only
Students Who already smoke; the warnings would not be
reaching the non-smoker, about whom Thompson has ex-
pressed great concern. In the second place, the signs would
probably lose whatever effectiveness they may have in a
short period of time, as happened in Great Britain.

It is further felt that Dr. Thompson would perhaps get
better results by attempting to educate students with his
ﬁndings of the relevancy of smoking and disease than be
trying to scare them out of dropping their coins into the

' Other Viewpoints in Fiction .':;

    The Wrys Eye

Successful fiction today seems to be_character-
ized by the narrator with the wry eye. -He is
usually the protagonist of a story, but he may be

A ‘ the non-omnipotent observer. This narrator is sen-

sitive to his environment, but he
can laugh at himself. Compared
to the other individuals that
populate his/ﬁctional world, he
is refreshingly different. Occa-
sionally he is even a bit irrever-
ent. But, when he stands along-
side the protagonists ’ in’ most
modern fiction, he appears to~be
a brother to all of them.
Usually he has at right to
view the world with a wry eye.’ " 

 

‘He may be like Ralph Ellison’s I

invisible man, learning the hard way how rough
the world canbe. or, he may be like studs Loni-
gan, growing up in a tough, dreary environment,
livingdesperately between small hopes.

He,can be bitterly cynical—Tom Wolfe’s George
Webber cursing the‘ society he feels uncomfortable
in, or he can be ‘pathetically hopeful'——Maugham’s
Philip Carey thinking happy thoughts because Mil-
dred has agreed to go out withhim. Although the
possessor of the wry eye conforms to a certain type,
his mannerisms still can vary. They can include
the brash adolescence’ of Holden Caulﬁeld and the
babbling yet perceptive hatreds of the man whose
notes from the underground Dostoevsky gave us.

'Awo|('es to Realities

‘If this protagonist doesn’t_go‘through the pro-
cess of‘ awakening to the realities of life during" the
narrative,'then "probably he has done so before it
began, and, then. the story may chronicle his vari-
ous struggles as viewed through the wry eye.

In writing courses at this University one realizes
that many beginning writers also Jare trying to
utilizethe wry eye: They use autobiographical in-
cidents, looking “back at them" with the wry’ eye,
and illustrating their thoughts on life with the
actions and observations of their protagonists.

' \

By Barry Gross

These protagonists are young men or young
women infused with an ability to perceive their

own misfortunes and shortcomings and to laugh at ‘

them. And, although the laughter may contain
cynicism, it also contains elation, because they are
sensitivevenough to_feel that being alive is good
in itself.

This laughter, this wry eye, animates these pro-
tagonists and gives them a deep burning drive. It
is probably of the author’s own spirit and, when
successfully transferred to a work of ﬁction, gives
the work a desired force and honesty.

Thisnis a good way to write and a good way to

view the world, but is it the onlyway possible '

today? _ . ..

One professor" has suggested that the wry eye
is a reaction to the sentimentalism found in earlier
fiction, that it‘ might be the‘ only alternative to
sentimentalism.
Jusi-One Method

I think not, for  believe that the wry eye is
just one literary method for conveying arrhonesty
of thought and emotion. When the. wryleye is used,
the protagonist is closely identiﬁed with the author.
The author uses his own experiences, but -gives his
protagonist an understanding that comes only from
hindsight, an understanding that the protagonist,

, often co'uldn’t possess in the given situation.

Is it not possible to view_the world ‘without
using the wry eye, yet still 'maintain‘ and honesty
and forcefulness of thought and emotion?

Perhaps it is possible to de-emphasize the wry

eye, to give protagonists other outlooks, other atti- _

.tud'es. How does" the young man or young woman.
who ’/is ‘thick-skinned ratherthan sensitive, dull and
plodding rather‘ than imaginative, oppressive rather
than oppressed, react? These people exist.’ They
should not be relegated to secondary roles only.
Some "writers, both - amateur and professional,
should study and then write‘ about the actions and

’ emotions of _these types, rather than conﬁning
. their viewpoints to that of the wry eye.

  The C0ml3|ex Wink

Harvard" University has an athletic program.
according to, The New Yorker, “that prides itself
on its complexity, rather than its sheer bulk, and
is designed primarily to attract and give’ pleasure
to -individuals.” ' ”

In this respect, it is typical
of the intramural -programsaof
several‘ Eastern colleges, al-"
though it is larger and ‘better

Perhaps this is why Harvard
is the vanguard in the newest
and zaniest intercollegiate sport
which has occupied theearnest
efforts of some twenty-ﬁve col-
leges this year and already gen-
erated a legend and language
of its own.

It centers around an innocent parlor pastime
of children turned. diabolicalin the hands of more-
or-less grownupsz- tiddlywinks.

By strict deﬁnition, tiddlywinks, now quoting
Daniel Webster, is“‘an unlicensedpublic‘ house; a
beerhouse.”‘ Tiddlywinking, according to the same
source, is “idling, droning, or cheating.”

Knowing this, it seems scandalous that the “us-
and-God Ivies” would even touch the sport. But
the novelty was introduced by the English, most
proper students of Oxford at that. This makes it
quite the thing.

Tiddling Infected _

Intercollegiate tiddling infected America ‘last
fall when a team from Oxford came to the United
States. English students had ‘been winking it up
since 1955 and felt like showing off in the colonies.

They had grafted on to it “a complexity worthy
of a country which had produced such bizarre.
complications as cricket and English grammar,”
reported Time. ,

Tiddlywinks has become much more complex
than the infant‘ idea of simply snapping a chip into
a cup.‘ College-educated people corrupt everything
simple in like manner. " ' .

harrass the anxious coeds who are still trying to
master the meanings of an inside right, a ﬁeld goal,
wing-T, andibase on balls.

The two basic terms of the sport are “squidge”
and “squop.’? The “squidge” is the basic winking

. shot,,the shooting of a disk into the‘ tiddlepot, or

cup. The .f‘squop” is a, crucial defensive maneuver
thatimmobilizes an opponent by landing your disk
on top of his. A

A squopped wink cannot be squidged again until
it is ‘de-‘squopped, either by the original squopper
or by a squopped player’s partner who manages to
squidge a third wink atop the second and spill the
squopper off. ' '

The squop shot is new to Americans and usually
the death knell. The_ British have a cry: “Well

a squopped!”

Harvard lost to the Oxonians. Hating to be
second, best to the old mother country in anything,
Harvard formed its own varsity and besides some
Ivy Leaguers, they played Mt. Holyoke, Simmons
and Wellesley. —

The Crimson Bandit-~
Later they set up two’-man units, each with a

I

powerful squidge and a canny defensive squopper

known as the "Crimson Chinese Bandit.

Peter Freeman, the team captain of Oxford,
said the sport of tiddlywinksis a national asset.

“There is an enormous amount of physical
strain on wrists and elbows and to the squidging
ﬁngers,” he said. “There  terriﬁc mental pressure
and unbearable tension. The game provides exce1-
lent mental conditioning. Had the Empire been
built on tiddlywinks, perhaps we would never have
lost it.”

Sports publicist Beano Cook was asked what he
thought about adding the sport to the school pro-
gram. He is a press agent who has withstood the

-barrage of enthusiasts‘ advocating cricket, judo,"

 Consultant Encourages

ii"I'Grads for New School

By NANCY FUCHS

To break down the stereotype of the librarian “as a lone-

ly maiden lady conﬁned to

stamping books and seldom

speaking above a whisper” is themission of Carol Vogel,

Library Career Consultant and Assistant to the Dean of the ‘

University’s Graduate School of Library Science.

Only 26 herself, Miss Vogel, a6

graduate of Chatham College who

ence degree from Carnegie Li-

brary School and worked in Car- L
negie Library, Falk Library off:
the Health Professions, and thei
St. Margaret Memorial Hospital;

Library, is obviously a contradic-
tion to the stereotype.

» Provides Encouragement
It is her job to encourage young

"”\'~-and middle-aged‘ college- gradu-

o

   
 

ates‘, both men and" women, to
enter the library‘ profession, one
of the most understaﬁed profes-
sions in the country.

In August, 1961, the Pennsyl-
vania Legislature passed the
first bill giving state aid to li-
braries, which was to be ad-
ministered by the State Library.
The Pennsylvania Library As-v
sociation, an organization of all
professional libraries in the
state, induced the'State Library
to give a- grant to the,Univer-
sity’s new Graduate School of
Library Science to recruit'li-
brary personnel.

The University used this $20,-
-000 grant to establish ‘the posi-
tion of career consultant, which
was ﬁlled by Miss Vogel’.

Navy Researcher Joins F aculty ,

Scientist Appointed

Dr. David Minard, a Navy
scientist ‘who has devoted
much of his career to the
study of environmental ef-
fects on human beings, will
join the faculty of the Uni-

versity’s Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health in August of this year.

Presently the head of the Stress
Physiology Division at the Na-
tional Naval Medical Center,
Bethesda, Maryland, Dr. Minard
will tentatively assume his posi-

'. tion as professor and head of the

D e p a rt m e n t . of Occupational
Health upon completion of twenty
years-of service in the Navy. _
Extensive Background
Originally from Fargo, "North
Dakota, Dr. Minard attended

f North Dakota State College and

received his B.S., Ph.D;, and M.D.
degrees at the University of Chi-
cago. He also received his Master
of Public Health degree ' with
honors from Harvard.

Dr. Minard has taught physi-
ology at the medical schools of
the University of Louisville and
the University of Illinois and
lectured on heat and cold stress
in the Naval Medical School.

His research experience, in-
cludes work" in both civilian and
Navy medical schools, ﬁeld studies
of physiological effects of combat
stress in Korea, probes of blast in-
juries in the Texas City disaster of
1947, and studies’ of survival
equipment in the tropics of
Panama and frozen wastes of
Newfoundland.

In the mid-1950’s Dr. Minard
and several associates, including
Dr. Harwood Belding of the Uni-
versity’s" Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health, conducted a study aim-

ed at preventing heat casualties,
using leatherneck recruits at Par-~

ris Island, South Carolina.

Last August Dr. Minard and
his associates studied the reac-
tions of about 100 Navy volun-
teers and medical observation
officers who. spent ' two weeks
underground in a shelter de-

ical and biological attack, radio-
active effects and blast.

The same volunteers had spent

two weeks _in the shelter the
previous December. To those test
conditions, high temperature and
humidity were added in the Au-
gust trial. Dr. Minard the medical,
psychological, physiological and
related effects of the period of
isolation and the suitability of the
shelter itself. '

Dean James A. Crabtree feels
that Minard “will bring a unique
background of training and ex-

Swimmers Outsplash
Princeton Tigers, 51-44

By FRED NIARCUS
The swimming team marked the ﬁftiethhanniversary of
the ﬁrst school meet here with a sparkling 51-44 victory over

highly heralded Princeton in
night before overif’-00 fans.

The teams were deadlocked at 44-44 before the

Trees Hall’s debut Saturday

lﬁnal

event — the 400—yard free style relay.

The fans looked like they wereO

telling fish tales when it was all
0ver—most stretching their hands

‘apart, about the span of a good-

sized trout.
Relay Wins

The Panthers dashed the Tigers’
hopes by that much as the crack
relay combination of Rob Levine,
Tom Ribarchak, Steve Ganong
and Rick Pctterson splashed home
in a record-shattering time of
3:24.().

The old mark of 3:3l.0 was
set in 1961 by Tony Sarsﬁeld.

Carl Warnes. Rich Rush and
Bart Haas.
'1‘hrce other school standards

were broken in the hectic duel.
Ron Levine posted a time of 2:10.7
in the 200-yard individual med-
ley to break his 1962 mark of
2.17.5. In the 200-yard butterfly,
he sliced his 1962 record of 2:l5.0
down drastically to 2:052.

Ribarchak splashed through in
51.5 in the 100-yard free style
to break Jim Zurche/r’s 1956 mark
of 52.0, the oldest record’ on the
books. Rob Levine got the other
first, copping the 200-yard free
style event in 1253.9.

After watching the double-
winning Levine twins in action,
Bart Haas, last year’s_captain,
now simply a rabid fan, said,
“Those kids are just amazing.
And see what a pool can do for
you.”

During a short ceremony before
the meet, Chancellor Litchlield
and Athletic Director Frank
Carver spoke about the import-
ance of the pool to the ideals of
the University.

After whipping the sixth-rank-V

ed team in the nation, one of the
swimmers quipped, “Maybe the
new ideals include winning.”

John Carr, who could. develop
into Pitt's first top-notch pinner in
a long time, put Dave Post’s

The other sophomores didn’t do
as well. Tom“Heniff made a ﬁne

with Ralph Bahna to score a 6-6
tie. Tom Baily was outclassed by
Dave Dozeman, 6-3, in the 137

wrestled well for two periods be-
fore falling to Wilkes Tournament
champion Lee Dietrick, 5-3, at 147

In the upper weights Jim Har-

The athletic department is now seeking entries in its up-
coming intramural basketball program which is scheduled
to begin this week‘in_ the Stadium Gym.

The deadline date for the fraternity and engineering
leagues isitoday while the deadline for the dormitory and
independent leagues is Wednesday. Both dates will undoubt-

edly be extended as will the'start0

of the competition.

The league has. been overhauled

this year in an attempt to mini-
mize’ the forfeitures and maxi-
mize continuing interest. A ten
dollar entrance fee must be post-
ed.
Lessen Forfeits

If a team doesrnotiforfeit any
of its games the full amount will
be refunded. Five dollars will
be returned of a team forfeits

p one game and the total amount

‘will be held if two games are
forfeited. A twice-guilty team
will also be dropped from the
league.

The entry fee must be payed
before a team can be scheduled
for competition. The fee can
be paid at the ticket office in
Fitzgerald Field House."

The leagues will also be con-
ducted on around-robin basis in-
stead of last year’s double-elimi-

 nation system. .

Both new innovations, were
suggested in a Pitt News article
(Nov. 12), which set forth ways
to rehabilitate a sagging intra-
mural program.

The new set-up will ‘probably
reduce the number of entrants,
but a sincerely interested group,
knowing their money will be re-
turned after earnest participa-
tion, should enter without any

,_f‘-' misgivings.

Gymnasts Prep
For Opener;
Vets Look Good

. Achieving precision in routines
is the main objective ‘of Coach
Warren Neiger asvthe gymnastic

team prepares to open _its season
at Syracuse on Saturday. .

Several of the veterans have
looked very sharp in workouts,
according to Coach Neiger. Ed
Zamecnik, the .team ace, has
shined on the horizontal’ bar and
has shown good form in the other
events.

Roland James, who was the
top man in the side ‘horse last
year, has looked impressive in
an effort» to retain his position.
Bob Pingatore, another. key
man, is showing top form in the
long horse, his main ‘event.

The supposedly weak ‘events,

_the still rings and free exercise,

have been strengthened, John
Lehner, has looked good. in some

of thestill ring routines, but needs.

work in several others Jack
Schwar, a, sophomore, has im-
proved considerably in the free
exercise.

Coach Rex Peery’s great
sophomore prospect Mike
Johnson-* gave an indication
of what can be expected of
him during the collegiate season
when he ﬁnished second in the
Pan—American game tryouts at
Stillwater, Oklahoma in the 125.5
pound class.

Wrestling against the nation's

iﬁnest grapplers, Johnson entered

.into the three man roun,d—robin
ﬁnals leading by the_ complicated
scoring system that_is used.
Johnson tied Oklahoma State’s
Dennis Dutsch, 1-1 in. his first

dle, 1-0. Since Johnson had led
Dutsch, who also lost "to Riddle,
going into the ﬁnals he was placed
in the second spot.
Killian Fourth

Duﬁf Killian placed fourth in the
115.5 pound class.
Dino Boni, the other Pitt repre-
sentative, failed to place.

At the Wilkes College Tour-
nament, where the remainder
of the team wrestled during the
vacation, the -team ﬁnished a
disappointing third with Jim

match and then lost to Bill Rid-'

Cleary’s win was termed “a big
surprise” by Peery, especially
since it was over Bethe] Green-

sidered one of the best 130-137
pounders in the East.
