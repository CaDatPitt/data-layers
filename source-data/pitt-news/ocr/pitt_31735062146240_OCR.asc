1. Only one foot -on the ﬂoor at a
time, ‘please. Two makes it twice as
crowded.  -'.
2. Care -must be taken not to

 

scratch the furniture, while dancing;

for example, under’ the baby grand.

3.’ In dancing ‘over the ceiling, be-4 _

ware, lest the fresco-work be muti-
lated. '

4. In skidding along the walls, Abe-

watchful of certain large picture-
hooks, which are detrimental to the
shoe-shine. ' ‘ «

5. Partners must dance sufficiently . .
far apart that the crowd may dance 1
‘ through between ’em. This mitigates
(consult Webster) the necessity of a

traffic cop. x 7

6. Those wishing to imbibe of the
juice of lemon, please supply them-
selves with a 10 or 12-foot straw, in
order to prevent any atmosphere of
-closeness about the cut-glassery.

ing. r . ' * ~ S.  "
“To Lieutenant Colonel Thompson: 
you are athletic officer of the Second Army
and that you intend to visit our town, Satur-
day. I will be very glad to see you as it 18
a‘ pleasant ~su-rprise to run across some one
from Pittsburgh. In the nine months that I
have spent here I have seen no one from that
part of the country. We are ‘laboring under
rather adverse conditions with our football
team as We have nothing in the way of equip-
ment except footballs. It is therefore a big
help to us when you turnover the unif_or’ms.”‘
_* First Lieutenant--“Pete" Hell. 
Now, just a‘ word a‘oout.“Old Joe;.'-’_
ll-l_e'refers to “Pete” Heil as be’ing..a‘
lion with his "men. And that is ex-
actly. the" ‘name all the men call‘f»‘.loe”,
when they get back here. He; is de-
scribed" as one of ‘ the most popular
and nervy officer's that battled,
against the Hun‘. And. he‘ had hi_s
men with him‘ a hundred per cent.
Recently Charles’-.J.~ ; Doyle, special
Pittsburgh Gazette" Times staff man,
wrote the following article. in which
he told of “Joe:” 1
“The writer has, just completed _a tour of
the district occupied by the Keystone (llVlSi0l:l,‘
where he found hundreds of Western Penn-
sylvania-boys. Among the exceptionally popu-
lar ﬁg_:ui-es is that sterling Beaver county citi-
zen, known in army lists as Lieutz. Col. Joseph
H. Thompson, although the. doughb_oys_ of. ﬁhlﬁ
regiment, who witnessed his -exploitson the
front line, always feel like calling h1m"Joe'.’ »
“The former Pitt football star’ and coach‘
proved a real inspiration" to the boys~;in_y~'the
ranks, and had greatinfluence over them._ All
display deep affectionfor him and seem anx-
"ious that the public should ‘knowthis. - -_
‘.'At the beginning -of the year_‘._loe’ was
‘made’ athletic ‘director of_ the entire Second
Army, which included *7 dxv1s1ons,'- or approx-
imately 200,00_0 soldiers. ___He _hes1ta/ted. about
leaving.the‘"Keystone diVlSl0n but when Gen-
eral» Ballars, commander -of the, Second Army.
assured him that he would be returned later
to his‘ ownzdivision, he, took hold of _the_ work
with his usual ‘pen’ and now athletlcsm the
Second Army is abrxght’ feature of the A. E.

Following is a "copy of “-Joe s” of-
ﬁcial citation, .which was handed us
recently by one of our alumni. it
has already been published ‘in; one

L. K, Mccurdy was appointed as
team last week, after one of the keen-
est competitions for basket ball.man-
agership that Pitt has ever had. Mc-
Curdy lives at 166 Prospect avenue_,
Ingram, Pa. He served as apprentice
manager for the 1917-1918 season, and
as an assistant manager for the 1918-
1919 season. Next year he will be a
Junior in the School of Engineering,
and stands very high in his work, as
the Dean of Engineering highly rec-
ommended him for the position of
' manager. iVIcCurdy is a member of
the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity.

Next year's schedule will be started
immediately. This schedule will be a
little more ambitious than the 1919
card, and more of the large Eastern
schools will be played. It is likely
that Colgate University. will appear
here, as they have already asked for
a game. ' '

students who were granted diplomas
by the Board of Trustees because they
had entered the service just before
the end of their Senior year, are the
names of Jack Thompson, former
Varsity football manager, and Foxy
Miller. a member of the Varsity‘ for
four years

“JACK” THOMPSON A

Jack was manager of the 1916 team

fore the close of the year. He served
in France in this service as a.-First
Lieutenant. Jackhas been activein
other lines while at Pitt, his special

Foxy Miller enlisted in the 0rd-
nance before the end of his Senior
year and was a Sergeant at Wasliing-
ton when discharged. Time and again
he thrilled the spectators at football
games with his long‘ runs just at tlge
e

ous injuries that kept him out of

ELEHIBILITY RULES  
RElllIlllfll_Al rm

Many Barred From Pitt Ath-
letics By Failure to Comply
With Rules——-All Athletes
Should Know Them

___.—_______k__._

In view of the ‘fact that it has been

' necessary to debar several men from

competition in University athletics
during the past few years, Graduate
Manager K. ‘E. Davis recommends
that all candidates for University athl
.letic teams acquaint themselves thor-
oughly with these following eligibility
rules:. .

' Section 1. No one shall be allowed
to represent the University of Pitts-
burgh in any inter-collegiate athletic
contest. either individually or as a.
member of a team, _unless he can
satisfy the _Eligibility Committee
that he is, and intends to be
the academicyear, a
bona ﬁde student in the University,
taking a full year’.-1 work as deter-
mined by the faculty of each school.

Section 2. No student shall be
granted permission to participate in

inter-collegiate atlile-tics unless his
scholarsliip is- satisfactory. Should
his scholarship fall below the re-

quired standard and his work not be
satisfactory, he shall be dropped
from the team and debarred from
athletics until all back work has been
made up in a manner satisfactory to
the faculty of the school in which he
is enrolled. The faculty representa-
tive of each school. shall submit to
his Dean within ten days’ of. approval
by the Eligibility ‘Committee, a list of

names of all candidates froni his
school.
Section 3. No students shall take

part in any athletic contest without
a certiﬁcate f.rom proper medical au-
thority that he is ﬁt to enter such
a contest. Violation of this rule de-
bars‘the student from all further par.
ticipation in ‘athletic contests until

-on such teams, even after the sea-

son, without talking the matter‘ over
with ‘Director Miller, as many of
such teams are in bad repute with-
the A. A. U. and are playing pro-
fessionals. It is very ‘easy, -if a'man
desires to play in an outside game
and merely for the sport—-such as for
a Y. M. C. A. team, a. school alumni

Seldom ‘has a,basket ball season
turned out so favorable as the re-
cent. one. Although the success of
the Varsity was a; surprise to the
entire student body and the public
at large, the interest and “pep” that
was__brouglit about between the fra-
ternities and the wonderful material
that was produced in order to “cop”
the coveted cup given to the success-
ful fraternity team, was a much more
surprise to those interested in the
contest. The league closed its sea-
son when the Phi Gamms won the
.“cup” by dcfeatiiig the Delta Taus
in a spirited game. It was during.the
preliminary games to the Varsity that
the organizations through its efforts
to place a successful and represen-
tative team on the floor, surprised
the spectators and the athletic au-
thorities, by',th_e skill and the knowl- ’
edge of the game as was displayed
by the members of flit; different
teams. .

The league has brought forward
such ‘unlocked for material among
the various fraternities in the form
of floor stars with a. comparatively
short season, due to the S. A. T. C.
that one wonders the possibilities of
teams with such stellar performers.
with a regular season in which to
dyevelop their skill. -

‘tars who would do justice to any
team and :;.-Tome of whom look like-

“Tom’* Davies of-last season’s foot-

TEAM _Wl_lllllS lllllllllllllﬁ

   

The University of Pennsylva.nia’,s
twenty-fifth annual relay carnival to
be held at Fganklin Field, Philadel-
phia. April 25 and 26, promises to
reach pre-war standards. Reports
from all over the country point to a
big revival of interest in college
track and ﬁeld athletics. Scores of
star athletes who left college to go
into the service have "returned so
that the standard
should reach or surpass the high
mark attained prior to the war.

The Relay Carnival will be the
ﬂrst big intercollegiate meet of the
year. Assurances have already been

received from all the big colleg s of

the East and most of those from the
Middle We-st. that they will send
teams. In addition, the University of
Washington and the Univer;-’ity of
Southern C-aliforniaare seriously con-
sidering sending relay teams.

Donnley h.as surprised‘ all who

clever jumping, knack of getting
