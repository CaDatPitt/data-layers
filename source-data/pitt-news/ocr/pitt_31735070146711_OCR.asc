Congressman Joe Sestak answered
questions from Pitt News readers
after a rally in the Steel City on Satur-
day. Sestak, a Democrat, is running
for U.S. Senate against Republican Pat
Toomey.

Michael Scottwas known to be on the

 ‘ quietside,andthosewho knewhim

described him as a great listener.
After starting his freshman year,
Scott planned to major in biology
and eventually become a doctor. He
graduated from Gwynedd—Mercy

V Academy and La Salle College High

School near Philadelphia He ran
track and played soccer at La Salle.
Pitt police found Scott unrespon-

sive in his Lothrop Hall room last '

month. The county coroner and po-
lice concluded that the death was an
apparent suicide. ‘ A

Theson of David and Alicia Scott,
he was born in Abington, Pa. He is
also survived by a younger brother,
Matthew Scott.

David shared some memories of

 ' Michael lastweek. David said he used

to give him hair cuts once every two
weeks, a tradition theycontinued
for about a year before he moved to
Pitt.

“I looked forward to that hair

cut because it gave Michael and me
a chance to talk and become close,”
David said.

Michael and his brother Matthew
also were very close, David said.

“Michael and Matthew went from
just living in the same house as broth-
ers to becoming close friends,” David
said. ,

David said that he and Alicia
enrolled Michael in La Salle College
High School to help him develop
friendships -and memories beyond
the classroom. 4

David said that La Salle seniors
typically went to wing night each
Tuesday at a local restaurant. .

“It was amazing that Michael had

. homework every other night of the

week except Tuesday for his entire
senior year,” David said during the
funeral service. “He would usually
remember when he got home that
he might have afew homework items
that he had forgotten.”

David said that Michael’s friends

were like “blood brothers.” They A

used to spend the night at the Scotts’
home and Alicia and David would
make pancakes and bacon for them

in the morning. i . A
James Dilviezza attended the same
high school as Michael, and said he
knew him for almost 13 years.
“Hewas probably one of the most
loyal people I knew and he always
went out of his way to help you out
with something that was going on,”
DiMezza said in an e—mail.
DiMezza said that one of Mi-
chael’s best characteristics was his
sense of humor. _
Michael could often keep a
straight face for longperiods of time

.« while making a joke, and his friends

sometimes called him “the one-face
Mike Scott.”

“For some reason we could not
stop cracking up,” DiMezza said.

Michael spent two weeks over the
summerin Germany and France with
his friend Max Oster, with nothing
but backpacks. Having. known Mi-
chael since their elementary years,
Oster didn’t second guess himself
when he approached Michael about

accompanying him through Eu-
. rope. ' A ‘ - '

“I couldn’t have asked for abetter

legislation to small businesses.

For example, CongressmanToomeywhen he
was on the Small Business Committee slashed the
small business administration budget in half.

I’ve been on the Small Business Commit-
tee. I’m the vice chairman. We’ve now reversed
[Toomey’s actions.]

[Toomey] focuses on wall street and ‘large

‘corp and waits for wealth to trickle down. Wealth

is driven up by small businesses.

How do you think we’d ever want to torpedo .

our economy again by privatizing social secu-
rity‘? ‘

He wants to take that and put itinWall Street
and let the broker take the security out of social
security. ,Do you think that a broker is going to
walk up and say ‘I’m sorry seniorl lost your sav-
ings but I’ll back it up?’ The only wealth security

that happens is for that broker.

TPN: How would you reform social secu-

Fity’?

Sestak: Easy, sit rightthere and realizethatwe
need to preserve the beneﬁts of social security.

So you sit back and you say Congressman
Toomey, you let the majority of tax cuts go to
the top lpercent, the wealthiest of the wealthy,
and afteryou did thatyou didn’t evenpay for it. It
added two trillion to the national debt 

Why don’t we go backto the years where the

top 1 percent, during the Clinton administra-
tion, just paid theirtax rate then, and we created
23 million jobs. That would keep social security
absolutely solvent for 75 years, and that’s just
one way to do it.

TPN: If you were elected to the Senate, how
would you try to get that cost transparency for
universities through?

Sestak: Reach across the aisle. In the ﬁrsttwo
years when I was down inthe House ofRepresen—
tatives I had more piece oflegislation passed than
any other congressman of my class.

TPN: How do you feel about the Tea Party?

Sestak: I think people are upset, concerned

and I respect that. But there are elements in it

that are too extreme, and Congressman Toomey
supports them and I don’t agee. I don’t agreewith

them, butI respect those in the Tea Party whose -

lives were slammed.

Representatives from Toomey’s campaign
could not be reached for comment. The dead-
line for voter registration is today. The election
is Nov. 2.

utes outofthetimetheywaste Fa- ‘

ebookcreepingandreadingPerez
Hilton and instead took a brief power
nap. Accordingtothe Huﬂington Post,
they’d be more productive.

Inareport,“Comparingti1e beneﬁts
of caffeine, naps andplacebo onverbal,
motor andperceptual memory,’ ’former
 researcherSaraMednickﬁnds
thatnaps enhance alertness, attention,
some forms of memory and perfor-
mance on procedural skills.

‘The best time for a nap, reports
the Huffington Post, is between 1 and
3 p.m. In addition, the nap should not
be longer than 30 minutes, to prevent
the napper from entering the deeper
stages of sleep.

Whereas the research behind the
beneﬁts of shortnapshasbeenaround
foravvhile, companies haven’tbeentoo
quick to encourage employee napping,
and employees are frequently reluc-
tantto accept the efforts companies do
make. The HuliingtonPost reportsthat
“a growing number, including Google,
provide napping pods and renewal
rooms. That’s a greatﬁrst step, but it’s
scarcely the norm to use them.”

The Pitt News is always down for
a little snooze. We acknowledge that
people aren’t productive 100 percent
of the time they are on the clock. In
addition, we understand that hours of
continuous work can take a toll.

I Whereas we love naps and the idea
of napping onthejob, thereare acouple
of issues with this extremely atuactive
idea. ,

Firstisthe problem ofwhere people
should nap. Ifyour workplace doesn’t

, have napping pods like Google, or

enough couchesforeveryone, perhapsa
yoga mat on the ﬂoor would suffice.

Butsome might notbe comfortable
with sleeping in public anyway. Keep
in mind you’re in a professional(ish)
setting and not in a situation where
you’re the ﬁrst to fall asleep at a slum-
ber party, but there’s always the risk of
someone Sharpie—ing male genitalia
on your face.

Then there’s always the problem
that whereas naps leave you feeling re-
freshed, they also leaveyou notlooking
so fresh. Bed head — or desk head —
could be troublesome, as well as wrin-
kled clothing and smeared mascara.

Despite these miniscule setbacks,
we think companies should still con-
sider naps as a production-boosting
option.

We think longer “European style”
lunch breaks would provide similar

beneﬁts to nap breaks, or even the '

perfect opportunity for a quick siesta.
A shorter workweek could also be an
option. Whereas the 35-hour work-

. week is no longer imposed in France,

it’s still the “reference length for the
French workwee ” accordingto Time
Magazine. ,
Even though all this might sound a
little lazy, the Hufﬁngton Post reports

that“it’snotthenumberofhourspeople '

work that determines the value they
create, but rather the energy they’re
capable ofbringing to whatever hours
they work.”

We agree.

to the point where Colbert was askedwto
submit his statement in writing and leave
the committee room. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-

Congress should not deal with fiction, at

Ultimately, this column is not about
Stephen Colbert. It is about the calling
of dumb congressional hearings and the
questioning of questionable witnesses.

ties to test-ify. That. allows congressmen
to look like a bunch of fun-loving, regular
folk who love good jokes as much as the
next person who loves pork, “the othe
white meat.” - ‘

The waste of time generated by these
hearings and witnesses is not unimport-
ant. The average Congress-creature and
its staff has mountains of paperwork to
wade through: answering constituent let-
ters, researching the 251 bills that became
public laws during the 111th Congress,
ﬁguring out how to vote in the 565 roll calls
in 2010 alone, appearing at functions to
do things like pin the blue ribbon on the
heaviest cow bred by a member of the 4H
club in Box Butte County, Neb. — useful
things like that.

Congress should not deal with fiction,
at least any more than it usually does.

fied having" Stephen Colbert testify.

The Colbert hearing was at least about
a serious issue on which both parties agree
Congress. must act: illegal immigration.
But some hearings haven’t even been on
serious issues, my favorite example be-
ing the BALCO hearings about steroidsin
baseball. What concern is it of Congress
that-some Major League Baseball players
used steroids? Congress is not responsible
for the prosecution of crimes. If a crime
has been committed, it falls to thejustice
Department to investigate and prosecute

that crime and to the judiciary to adjudi-

cate the case.
Unless Congress was proposing some

law on regulation of steroids not already '

on the books, these hearings had no point.

V ESPN.com reported that some thought the

hearings were relevant for showing the
youth of America that crime doesn’t pay.
I would argue that a federal indictment
of-a baseball star, and perhaps testimony
of a baseball star in front of a grand jury,
would have the same effect. »

This is not to say that these hearings are
pointless. Calling hearings and less—than-
expert witnesses allow political points to
be scored. In the case of steroids in base-
ball, both sides of the aisle could look big
and tough for saying “that dangerous and
illegal behavior is dangerousand illegal”
in the apt words of George Will.

Hearings give Congress the appearance
of doing something, and doing something
everybody agrees with, like procrastina-
tion on serious assignments. There are
equally good reasons to summon celebri-

Now add to thisaspecial commission
to do something Congress has no busi-

ness doing, like re-open both 0.]. Simp-

son cases. Our congressman now has one
more dumb thing that has to be attended
to, researched and checked on with the
folks at home.

Calling silly witnesses or having silly
hearings also means that serious hearings
and serious witnesses are overshadowed.
The President of the United Farm Work-
ers, Arturo Rodriguez, testified alongside

Colbert. This gentleman no doubt had a’

distinct point of view, research, expertise
and policy prescriptions he’d like Congress‘
to enact. . .

Though I might disagree with what

t he had to say, at least I can see why he

would be talking to Congress.‘ Oh wait.
Who remembers what he had to say? We
remember only that he testified with a
celebrity. By the same token, there were
no doubt things more pressingvthan the
steroid crisis in baseball that Congress

' held hearings on. Who remembers what

they were?
Whereas it might not be as bad as the
other things congressmen have done —

like running up a huge deficit, waiting for

Social Security to collapse, keeping 90
grand in the freezer or molesting pages
— the pattern of political grandstanding

in hearings is still pretty bad. Congress V
should stop the levity and focus more on _

the pressing issues of today.

Real vampire comeback

‘Let Me In’ movie pays homage tolegends and folklore of the past

Jeffrey Ihaza
Staff Writer

“Let Me In”

Starring: Kodi Smit—McPhee
and Chloe Moretz

Directed by: Matt Reeves

Film Company: Hammer Film
Productions

Grade: A

Vampire movies have become
somewhat of a joke in recent
years.

With movies like “Twilight”
chipping away at the fabric of
classic vampire folklore, it felt
almost safe to say that the genre
was dead. Fortunately, a reprieve

I comes in Matt Reeves’ “Let Me

In,” a remake of the 2009 Swed-
ish book adaptation “Let the
Right One In.”

“Let Me In” tells the story of
Owen, a 12-year-old boy who is
tormented by his classmates and
whose parents are in the middle
of a nasty divorce. Owen’s life
changes when he meets Abby,
a mysterious girl who moves in
next—door with an even more
mysterious elderly man. The
elderly man is revealed to be a
murderer responsible for a string
of cult—like killings in the area. All
of his victims are drained of their
blood almost ceremoniously as
they are hung upside down.

As the ﬁlm progresses, we

learn that the man’s killings are
actually orchestrated by Abby in
order for her to survive on the
victim’s blood. The plot thick-
ens when the man botches one
of the murders and is caught by
the police. ' I
Owen and Abby meet in the
courtyard of their apartment
complex and quickly become
friends despite Abby’s warning
that she can’t have anything to
do with him. The dynamic of
their friendship epitomizes the
childlike innocence so prevalent
in the source material. After a
string of horrific events, Abby is
revealed to be a vampire — the

ALBUM REVIEW

Milk in rock ‘n’ mu
Cheerios still diluted

Jeffrey Ihaza
Staﬂ" Writer
Safari
Maybe Tomorrow
Unsigned

Rocks Like: That cover band you and
your friends started in eighth grade
Grade: D-

_ Ohio—based Safari’s third album Mqybe To-
marrowwas supplosedlyimade in response to
the “Kool-Aid drinkers and posers diluting
the milk in your rock ‘n’ roll cheerios,” ac-
cording to the group’s MySpace page And,
while the band’s whopping 22—minute—long
EP deﬁnitely wants to have an effect on our
collective rock ‘n’ roll breakfast cereal, it
falls tremendously short.

The CD’s opener, “Connie Gets What
She Wants,” starts off relatively familiar —
guitar riffs reminiscent of some alternative
rock song that you swear you’ve heard. It
leads any unsuspecting listener to expect
somewhat pleasurable listening. Then,
something strange happens — you hear
lead singer Nico Walker do what sounds
like a Neapolitan of famous lead singer

.. impersonations, making italmost impos-
sible to understand any of the lyrics.

Sadly, the incomprehensibility of most
of the lyrics is a plus for the album. Aside
from consisting of a relatively small scope
of words, Walker’s songwriting is full of
a certain sense of self-importance. In his
own statement, he describes his song-

writing as “at once brash and melodic,
lacerating and sweet.” When listening to
songs like “Texas” or “Banger,” where
phrases are literally repeated over and
over again, it’s easy to wonder where the
self-proclaimed “melody” exists.

In essence, Safari is just another one
of those bands that considers itself “the
hardest working band in the business”
without actually doing anything very origi-
nal. Its new album consists of hackneyed
song structure, pedestrian" lyrics and bor-
rowed vocals. * j

tomers about Afghan culture through ﬁrst-
hand accounts handed along with the food.

“We’re tossing around ideas of how to
display-the information in a new and cre-
ative way,” said Angel Gonzalez, an intern
researching Afghan culture for the kitchen.
5‘Dawn talked about actually presenting the
information on the pastry by making etchings
on the grill.” '

Part ofthe challenge has been collecting in-
formation directly from Afghans in the United
States and abroad. .

“It’s been quite a bit more difficult to engage
with Afghans than Iranians just from a matter

- of being able to literally contact a person,”

Weleski said. “I haVen’t met an Afghan yet
living in Pittsburgh ... If anyone knows any
they can contact us.”

_ ' Although she was hesitant to say too much
about the Afghans’ opinions for politically
sensitive reasons, Weleski found a common
thread of ideals between individuals she man-
aged to contact. V

“The one thing that has struck me the most
is that even from the diversity of opinions

* politically, everyone wants «security because

it’s been quite some time since they’ve felt
that,” she said.

Weleski said she and her collaborators
chose Afghanistan after Iran to juxtapose the
two cultures that might be seemingly alike
because of their geographic proximity toeach
other, especially to unknowing Americans.

“Ethnicities in Afghanistan are more varied
than Iran. People in Afghanistan feel more
belonging to their local tribe than country 
it’s very different from being Persian or Ira—_
nian,” she said. p

Another difference will be the content of
additional programming events the kitchen
hosts. Over the summer, the Kubideh Kitchen
hostedtwo live Skype events between Pittsbur-
ghers and Iranians — one was a live dinner and
the other was a YouTube cultural mash-up.

“Afghan culture does not celebrate music
or singing, but instead emphasizes visual arts,
poetry and calligraphy,” Weleski said.

While the kitchen continues to promote
dialogue among customers and the commu-
nity, the collaborators realize that not all of it

“We’re going to get some negative feedback
from people that don’t really understand the
scope of the project or that have family that
are in Afghanistan and are going to be sensi-

to take a step back from the situation and say,
‘We do support the people risking their lives
in Afghanistan and the mission of the United
States, but it’s important in ending the conﬂict

Dadijaa Bliudzius I Staff Photographer

Ray Graham breaks free for a 79-yard touchdown run in Saturday’s 44-17 win over FIU.

He put on about 10 pounds of muscle

in the summer and now has the ability to
‘break tackles that he might not have last

season. He’s always been a shifty runner,
but he seems more willing to initiate con-
tact this year, with the strength to get extra
yardage after first contact. 1

The twobacks are quickly turning into
one of the best tandems in the country.
The team needs to find a way to get them
in the game at the same time, and I think

I it will.

Yes, I know that fullback Henry Hynos-

ﬁeld and is an NFL—caliber player, but with

Just think back to Ronnie Brown and  g -

Cadillac Williams in the same backﬁeld

you need to know about how effective two
running backs can be.

“The way we want to run the ball, I’ve
gone through four tailbacks in a season,”
Wannstedt said after Saturday’s game.
“We’re going to need them both.”

Lewis should be healthy for this week-
