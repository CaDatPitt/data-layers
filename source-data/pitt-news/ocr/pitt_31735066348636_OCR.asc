conducted in 1973 and presents a
detailed economic analysis of three
alternative underground garages
on the Schenley lot site with
capacities of 320, 671 and 921 cars.
Adjusted capital cost estimates for
the three plans are $4,030,000,
$0,350,000 ’and $8,580,000.

Ramp recommends the 921-car
plan because it “would produce the

Pitt's possible involvement in

guaranteeing a bond issue would’_
‘be based on a commitment to the

city to develop 600 parking spaces,
according to Joseph J. Wozniak,‘
executive director of the Public
Parking Authority.

However, the University is under_
no" obligation to accept the
underground parking garage con-

cept and can choose to find parking '

facilities" elsewhere.‘

Although Schenley Plaza is
city-owned property, Pitt's partici-
pation in underwriting upto 2/ 3_of
the bond issue is necessary to the
project, Wozniak said. ' '

The garage would be owned by

the parking authority, which would
also guarantee part of the bond
issue. ‘ ~ '

If the garage failed to generate

anticipated revenues, the bond,

_guarantors would be responsible

for cost and operating deﬁcits.

Because Pitt would be ‘the major
guarantor, the parking authority
would lease the garage to the
which could then
choose its own operator, Wozniak
said.

After yesterday’s meeting with
the parking authority, Chancellor
Posvar told the Pitt News, “We’re
going to have to look very closely at
the cost and feasibility and the
demand for a parking garage."
This “look" will include an
investigation into the accuracy of
Ramp’s ﬁgures, he said.

“I don’t think a decision (by Pitt)
is going to be made for three or
four months,” he said.

Ramp suggests the 320-car plan
should be rejected because of the
high cost per parking space relative
to the other two alternatives, the
high parking fee that plan would
require and the marginal addition
of only 97‘ new spaces after
accounting for the loss of the 223
parking stalls the Schenley lot now
provides. - , .

Based on its cost ﬁgures, Ramp
estimates the parking fee for either
of the two larger garages would
have to average about $.50 per

What can you do -when the/depiart_ment in which you are
majoring» offers most of its classes only at certain times of
the day? Or changes coursejnumber and content without
‘notice? '.  » ' _

These are the problems faced by Pitt Spanish majors.

Spanish majors have contacted Livewire complaining that
nearlyall courses are offered between 9 am-2 pm.‘ This
creates two problems for them..

First, classes often conflict with others they need for their
major. Thestudents must wait till next term.and hope no

classes due to scheduling conflicts, some parts of their day
are empty because the classes they need are not offered

then. .
_These students expressed to Livewire the ‘desire to have _
_j _ new..s,ect,io'ns ;opened,.at more conve,nient_,times. .

J 

   

 A Those _?s'tudents who had taken 150 had _to “go.back”

 

According to a source at the Room Scheduling Section
(G-18 CL) of the Registrar’s ofﬁce, students who wantnew
sections of a class should present a proposal to the
chairman of that department. Policies concerning new
sections vary among departments, due to budgetaiy

' reasons.

Spanish Department Acting Chairman.Herschel Frey
explained classes once were held outside these hours, but
were dropped due to lack of interest. He said in an
interview with Livewire that the department would
certainly beiwilling to hold classes at 8 am or after 2 pm,
but couldn't offer classes for only ﬁve people. He
requested those students interested in new sections to
Contact him. » ’

In a related.incident, the same students complained of
departmental decisions not made in their best interestg
They cited Spanish 150 and 151 ,as an example.

Sometime after fall term, 1974 and before the current 4

term, Spanish 150 and 151 were. changed to 50 and 51.‘

take 51, interrupting the sequence courses of their major.

Students complained their input was not sought by the’ _

department when it made the change. But Livewire‘:

discovered that student input is not necessary for"7—.

departmental policy changes. 

The students claimed it was improper for the department: 

to go ahead with this action without informing the
students. ‘ V »

Frey maintained the change was not published in the "H 3

course description catalog becauseit occurred after the 
_~‘;\

deadline for submitting material. He blamed the long time

between the submission deadline and actual publication for , V f

the lack of communication.

As aﬁrst step, Spanish majors should discuss the matter, .

with Frey, since he is the department chairman. This
advice also holds for majors in other departments who have
similar problems. . ._ ‘

between Student Government and
the AUE,” Harmon observed,
f‘has been communication that we
have initiated.” Siak contended,
“Student Government just isn’t
listening to use and our problems.
Communication between us has
been almost nil.’-’

The Allocations Committee, how-
ever, maintains the opposite.
“There was a notice-and a letter

sent to each organization about

-attending an allocations procedural
meeting,” Barry Weisband, a
member of the SG Allocations
Committee, .pointed out.

The procedural meeting was de-
signed to explain how to submit a
budget for allocations. According
to SG statistics, AUE was not
present at the meeting and missed
obtaining budgetary information.

Pat Cooper, also of the Allocations
Committee, said organizations
were notiﬁed of budgetary pro-
cedures. “At the beginning of the
year we. handed. out .a set of
guidelines for allocations to each
student organization. We really try
‘to give them all of the information
that we can,” she said,

Harmon, however, said no letter,
notiﬁcation or guidelines were ever
received to help them with bud-

_ getary problems. “None of us even

knew about the budget deadlines,”
said Harmon. “We had no, idea
about how to go about anything.
We were given no guidelines or
information concerning budgets.”
Liasons also were assigned from
the Allocations Committee to stu-
dent organizations to advise them
on allocation problems and pro-

   

cedures. Barry Weisband was the
liason to the AUE. A,
numeroustimes to get in touch
with the AUE,” Weisband said,
“butvl couldn’t conta_ct'them.” _ .
Because of the problems they
have had with SG over allocations,
the AUE contends it was not

prepared when it had to go before.

the SG Board. The Board meets

with all organizations and decides

on allocations._ . 
“One day before we were sup-

posed to appearbefore the Board,
.we got the recommendation of our K

budgetback from the Allocations
Committee,” Harmon said. “They
told us it would be ready a week

before; but it was overfive days?!-‘V;

late.”

.The Allocations Committee re-
commends how much money
should be granted to each organ-
ization, and gives. rationales for
their 2 recommendations. These
recommendations are sent to the
SG Board for approval.

.“In many cases,” Siak main-

" tained, “the rationales given by the ‘-7 

Allocations Committee just weren't
justiﬁed.”

“Also,_" Harmon pointed out,
“the AUE was given no informa-
tion about how to defend our
budget before the Student Gov-
ernment Board.” For this reason
the AUE drew up a1new budget
rather than develop a rebuttal,
which is the usual procedure for
groups dissatisfied" with alloca-
tions. ; 
No increased funds were granted to
the AUE and it received less than a
third of the funds it had anticipated
for the coming year.

BY KEN GORMLEY

Environmentalist Michele
Madoff, who hopes to become the
first female Commissioner in
Allegheny County’s history, has
entered the political arena by
attacking the failure of Commiss-
ioner William R. Hunt to take a
firm stand on environmental
issues. I

A Democrat, and founder of the
Group Against Smog and Pollution
(GASP), Madoff will be running
independently this ‘fall in the
general elections for a County
Commissioner’s post.

She opened her campaign by
insisting it is time for» Hunt, the
Republican minority Commiss-
ioner, to commit himself on
environmental matters.

“Local industries have promised
to clean up for 25 years,” she
claimed- “But theair and water

_ are just getting dirtier.’T

Madoff said Hunt should end his
laxity with industries and take a
stand in defense of the common
man.

“He should start to think in terms
of the rank-and-ﬁle people,” she
said, “and speak out about the
health and welfare of average
people...people in the coke mills.”

She is convinced the Com-
missioher has not done this so far.

- makes the devices, and

And she said Hunt’s refusal to
vocally support workers in their
environmental plight is evident.

People working in the steel mills,
Madoff said, are in poor health and
are even dying as a result of lenient
pollution laws.

Stricter enforcement of these
laws, she pointed out, will not have
-to result in a shut-down of
industries or a widespread loss of
jobs. ‘  ‘ .

“A healthy environment produces
a healthy» economy. Pollution
control put 800 million people to
work‘ in the past few years,”
Madoff said. “Who do you think
installs
"them? People.” .

She ‘claimed Hunt and the other
County leaders pretend not to see
the advantages of pollution control,
and are content with being
noncommital on environmental
problems.

A member of the Governor’s Air
Pollution Advisory Board, Madoff
was at Pitt last‘ week, in an effort to
get the 5,000 petition signatures

, needed to have her name placed on

the ballot in November. '

’ ‘Hunt refused to comment on any‘

of Madoff’s statements. “She’s
not. running against me in the
primary,” he said. ‘

An editorial in the Pitt News
inadvertently brought up a dis-
turbing point. It dealt with Ameri-‘ ~
ca's plans for coping with the
impending New Ice Age. The idea
of a mass migration to Mexico
was quite intriguing, but under
close scrutiny, the problems of-
such a move might far outweigh the
beneﬁts. Not the least of these
problems is “Who will be minding

Views on Racism
Hinder Equality

To the editor,
in the interest of the free flow of

‘ideas, 1 would like to reply to the

two letters from Nick Erickson that
recently appeared in the Pitt News.
The first was concerned with the
issue of interracial dating, and

groups of economically, socially
and educationally deprived black
children to the comparative intel-
ligence of the black and white
populations as a whole are obvious.
The fact of the matter is that black
children are not as compe'tent as
white children because they come
out of rotten schools and a major
factor contributing to the inferior
quality of those schools is that they
are segregrated--separate and un-
equaL

Such views as Mr. Ericks0n's can

ships.
why some couples decide to defy
the lingering aversion to interracial
relationships strikes me as mis-
guided at best. It would seem far
more productive to investigate the
rationale of those who share in the
“general dislike for such unions in
the US." I think we would ﬁnd
their motivations to be much less
metty than any thinking rightly or
wrongly attributed to the couples

, with whom Mr. Erickson has had

experience.

The second letter dealt with an
issue that is particularly important
against the background of the
struggle for school desegregation.
In it, Mr. Erickson claimed that
blacks are intellectually inferior to
whites and that such a claim can be
substantiated through scientific
testing. Anyone familiar with the
educational scene, however, knows
the tests that form the basis of
these assertions were invalid and
have been discredited by nearly
every reputable educator and psy-

"ciiologist. The dangerous political

implication of extrapolating from
the IQ figures scored by a few

 

our educational institutions to let
them go unanswered. The US
Supreme Court and various lower-
level bodies have established the
right of black children to educa-
tional opportunities equal to those
enjoyed by whites and that this
means the right to attend inte-
grated schools. Efforts to obstruct
desegregation seriously infringe
upon the rights of black students to
an equal education. Rather than
looking for reasons to divide our-
selves, it is time to recognize that
all children have a rightto a decent
education and a chance to achieve
their full potentials

to spend more on money-raising
sports than on women's sports
makes sense only if you look at it
from the point of view of one
university, but not from that of the
whole system of universities. Of
course, it is to Pitt's advantage to
spend considerable money on
recruiting, coaching, etc., and all it
takes to develop a winning football
team, since a winning team brings
in money in several ways. But if all
universities do this, will they all be
better off? Idoubt it. One school's
victory is another school’s defeat,
and the number of each will be
equal no matter how much is spent.

much anymore. You could see him

counting the money’ in the Mosque "

where Rich sits now. Somehow
Richie Engler has gained those
responsibilities, willingly or unwil-

‘ lingly (and I think the former would

have his wallet smile a lot more),
and has done quite a formidable job
against his foes. DiCesare was a
respected man for his talent pro-
ductions and it appears as if Richie
is bucking for the same status.
Butwith the depression on us and
talent popping up (and rock ’n roll
stars needing to feed their faces),
concerts are still a hot commodity.

University of Pittsburgh

day/April 4’5   1

Lots of people_are going...maybe
not as many as before...and they
are eager for a quality show for
their money. This puts the strain on
the promoter. Who do you bring
in? An unknown reeking with talent
or a CROWD pleaser? Hell--you

know who... folks that’ll rake in the,

cash. A wise man can do it right by
mixing concerts with a little of
both...Er_1gler does it well... _
I can see my reﬂection through
the doors that lead directly into the
hall _on the outside doors...the
black of a December evening gives
the background with a few street-
lights lighting up early comers who
have cuddled up waiting to get in. I
always feel silly running around
with my parka on and notebook
hanging out of my pocket but it's

‘really the only way I can keep

secure...knowing where that note
pad and pen are. As 'l_wrote down
some things, my reflection caught
my eye as I noticed it blending with
real people outside.

‘A few young girls, obviously
dressed up to see their hero, were
smoking a joint, and smiled when I

‘looked out. They probably thought .

_I was important or something.
Rich popped out of the office like a
Pop-tart and stood in the hallway.

/‘What's up?” I asked‘ him. “Oh,

nothing really. I gotta make sure

-they have the downstairs opened

up." He gazed around and/then

slipped around the corner into the '

dressing room. He looked as if he
were walking on clouds...snow
clouds for tonight...his small
framed body whisked by and onto
the stage, retrieving Jim.

It was getting kinda hairylwhen ‘I
decided to slide onto the floor. Two
seconds later Todd ran through the
doors and onto the state. The rest
of the band_followed. And‘ln a few
more seconds there was music‘. It
was phenomenal...how fast they
were. I slid back up the wall and
cruised on into the hall.

Todd was playing with dials and
switches and doing a sob at the
same time. Rich was below the
lights on stage left, scratching his
head.

Rich moved over to the other side
and talked to the lighting man and/
the roadies ch_ecking out the situ-

ation...everything was groovy 2lI_1__Clm:';'.~_-.:l

ready to go...even Todd.

Buzzing around the stage like an
uncontrollable lightning bug with
his strobe lights cranked up, Rich

‘left and went into the hallway

where I tried to intercept him. Too
late. He and the woman in charge
of the Mosque during those shows
were talking about something and
Rich was . ‘trying to be coy. His
hands were behind his back and he
shook his headv“yes" to everything
she said. He better, because she’s
been giving everybody shit about
rock ‘n roll concerts and those kids,
if they burn or stand on these new

seats, they cost us a lot of money;~’aml.

there will be no more shows! l!

The two other promoters here in
town are on shaky grounds with her
and are ass-kissing ’til their noses
are so brown they look like gene
freaks. But he isn’t kissing ,no-
body’s ass...just a light smooch
and acting like a ten-year-old who
wants something when you pass
through the toy department in
K-Mart...‘Yes, mommy,” “No,
mommy,” “Fuck you, Ma’am...” I
can-hear him now. But it’s some-
thing he has to contend with if he
plans on doing any shows here.

The Arena is spruced up as is the ~ ' if

Stanley Theater since they put/the
bucks into it...the seats were
unmarked until Rich decided to
dump some cash into marking
them, thus eliminating angry
crowds and hassles of management
and gaining some favors at the
same time.“

He keeps to himself so much of
the time. Even on the‘ phone...curt‘
and. precise, his sweet teenage
voice demanding attention and
getting it. A raspiness that matur-
ing hasn't cleared up doesn’t help -

.for a tough-guy-solid-promoter

image. With the ladies...well, that
another story...

Pretty Boy Meets the Man

...shit, there ain't nothin’ to do. I
wish the concert would start. These
nifty little programs Todd made are
OK. Holy Christ...not that chick

again. She's really fine. But
leechev.
“Hi, how are you?" Boy. who's

this with you, kiddo?

“Oh, hi, fine. Remember that guy
I told you about," she says as she
looks at her partner and I look at
her partner. “Well this is him. We
did the Zappa concert together,
huh?"

“Yeah."
woman.

“This is my sister Diane and this
is...uh...“

“Doug...Pitt News!" This chick is
really dumb. She fuckin’ did an
interview with Zappa and I had to
tell her everything.

“Is he giving interviews?” bat-
ting her ready-made eyelashes.

What a good-lookin'

~ “Nope. Not talking to anyone!

Rich told me no one allowed
backstage."

“Oh, well, I’ll talk to Rich...where
are you sitting?" Not with you.

“We have tickets to this show...
Row E. Hah.”

“Oh...oh, there’s Rich. Rich.”
And over she walks to Rich.

“Rich! Remembers me from the
Zapa concert,” she says, flashing
her enormous breasts
retina as Richie becomes all her
man, her rock promoter hero.

“Oh, yes, from Beaver...” most
carefully searching her every
movement and anatomical struc-
ture.

“Yes, Did you get my tearsheet?”

“No, 

“I sent it to Kenny J...”

“Well, he no longer works for us.
Jim takes care of all that now. Did
you get a packet on Todd?" Not
giving a good shit if she did. What
he wants to know is: Who is the
other girl?

r~’K"‘*“No. Oh, by the way, this is my

sister Diane.” Diane saunters up,
shakes her head hello, and ﬂips her

hair to make her sweater stretch

tighter. Say hello Richard and
compliment her. “Are you her
older sister? No! Oh, you look
older. Your sister’s ,right...when
you get on in age, it may be older,
but better also...”

“Excuse me, Rich, but can we
work out someting with passes?”

“Well...uh."--if you'll perform
bizarre sexual acts maybe--“maybe
we can arrange something. Here.
See if you can find a good seat. I've
got to go now. See ya‘ later? After
the show?" Sure kid. Now we got

...“Hel|o, may I speak to Rich

“Who's calling?" “Doug Geb-

“Just a moment... ‘I'm sorry Mr.
Engler is on another line and
expects to be a while. Can you
leave a message?"

“Well, I'm doing a story on him
and must talk to him. Can I call
back?"

“Around four."

“OK, tell him I called and will call

back, OK?" '

Four o’clock: “Mayl speak to Mr.
Engler please?”

“Mr. Engler isn't in now, may I
take a message?" A’

“I called earlier--Doug Gebhard.
No, I'll call tomorrow." '

Next day: ‘DiCesare/Engler Pro-
ductions.” .

"May I speak to Rich/Mr. Engler
PLEASE?"

“Just a minute, please...I’m
sorry, he has a few people in his
office and plans to be tied up the
rest of the day. ‘May I help you?”

“No, I have to speak to him about

an article for the Pitt News. Thank

you anyway.”

And that's the way it went for a
solid week. He was on the phone,
entertaining business associates or
out of the office. A busy man...and
quite obviously a man reluctant to

- talk.

From the outset he knew the type
of stuff I wanted...to see him in
action. But it became apparent that
I wasn’t going to get the inside
material I wanted. His associates,
including the one that was “no
longer working for him’..’ [who I
later found out was fired] said that
Rich was a tough guy to see
through. One said that not even his
wife could know all about him.

People who knew him from high
school and whose parents loafcd
with his parents presented an
image contrary to what you see...
his father is a boisterous mill hunky
who sits at the bar with his loving
wife and tells stories and jokes to
get plastered by. “Engler was the
faggy kid in high school...you,
know, had nothing to do with sports
or liked them and always dressed
daintily. _

“Friends of mine used to make
fun of him," said one kid. And
even today, despite the permissive
dress styles America has tolerated
and supported, he still looks like

the kid you kick sand in his face and
get away with it. ’

His silence at concerts is seem-
ingly to ward, off questions and
favors, to put the loud mouth in his
place...beneath the dignity of
speaking to him. But he's too small
to pretend that he’s tough. Anyone
would kick the shit out of him.
Mess up his hair and he'd fall
apart.

On the other hand he has an
authorative way of handling prob-
lems...he can delegate responsibil-
ity and TALK down a hyper
situation. That’s the only way, I’m
sure that DiCesare/Engler Pro-

 

 



ductions has survived the Mosque
hassles....Richard Engler can
sweet-talk the fuss-budget into
submission with his cutsie attitude
and walk away and call her a pain
in the ass...

...“Thank you very much, Pitts-
burgh. We love you.”

“Fuckin' Todd Rundgren, eh?"

“The show was tremendous,” I
said. There’s Engler. Hands on
hips and staring out into nowhere. I
wonder if he got off as much as we
did? I wonder if he understands
where Todd’s head is at? He

probably knows where his money is
at. That‘s for sure.

My ears for a full day after that
show buzzed like I was picking up
signals from Saturn. My eyes stung
from the bad dope smoke that came
from in front of me. When my ears
popped and I could ﬁnally hear I
called up DiCesare/Engler to talk
to Rich about this article.

“DiCesare/ Engler Productions.”

“Hi, may I speak with Rich

“If we provide parking, it is

‘Although the park idea is part of

Pitt students interested in health
careers can get on-the-job exper-
ience as summer volunteers in Pitt
YMCA's Project Medex at Shady-
side Hospital. .

The May-August medical exper-
ience program will create 25
volunteer jobs to supplement
classroom preparation in medicine,
dentistry and other health careers,
and may involve actual medical
training. ‘

“A volunteer at Shadyside learn-
ed how to take blood samples, and _

that's very unusual," said YMCA
Director Tom Huff. “Volunteers at
other hospitals empty bedpans and
do general custodial work.’
Shadyside encourages volunteers
to work with patients and get a real
feeling for the job."

The experience may help students
applying to graduate -and profess-
ional schools. “There’s extreme
competition among medical school
applicants," said prem'ed student
Adriana Selvaggio, coordinator of
Project Medex. .

“A 3.9 grade average or a 600 on
the Medical College Admission
Test doesn’t guarantee admission
anymore. Schools are looking for
other indications of qualiﬁcation,

tour of duty is over.

wish.

and volunteer work shows dedica-
tion. enthusiasm and real interest
in patient care," said Selvaggio.
Shadyside Hospital also will
beneﬁt, according to Shadyside
Volunteer Director Jae Brown.
“Dedicated volunteers who really
want to learn from their work will
help us function smoothly and more
efficiently," Brown said. “We

don't want holdovers from the V

candystriper era who just stand
around and make eyes at the
doctors; we want people who-will
help us get the work done," ,said
Brown. 0

Interested students who have
completed four terms and can work
at least six hours a week can apply
at the Pitt YMCA ofﬁce, 507 SU,
until April 18. _

Plans for fall include volunteer
programs at St. Francis dialysis
unit, Pittsburgh Free Clinic Ven-
ereal Disease Counseling Center
and Magee Women's Hospital.

LETTER TO THE STUDENTS

The governor's budget for our school imposes a financial problem"
on every faction in the University. Only a 3.75 percent increase in state
appropriations haS,been granted to us for the coming school year at a
time when the annual rate of inflation is approximately 12 percent. With
state appropriations comprising one third of Pitt's operating budget, this
will leave us with a several million dollar deficit.

As a result tuition could be raised by more than $100.00 a term next
September, unless the state legislature allocates more money to Pitt. In
addition, academic programs will be curtailed, and faculty will not

receive a compensation increase for inflation. Not only the cost of '
. tuition, but the quality of education at this university are at stake.

In response to this developing crisis, the three Student Govern-

V ments have organized a mass-media program to start on April 3rd. This

is called START-UP day (Students Against Rising T\uition, University of

Pittsburgh). It will kick-off our campaign to Convince legislators that

students cannot afford a massive tuition hike. ,

Letter-writing booths will be set up all over campus. At these stations,
volunteers will have lists of all the state representatives, ‘their ad-
dresses and phone numbers and writing supplies. We urge you to write
to your legislators, explaining how a tuition hike would adversely affect

. your academic or financial status. We also request that you ask your

parents to write to their legislators.

Open phone lines to Harrisburg will be available in the student
government offices for those who want to directly call their legislators.
The operation locations of both the open phone lines and the letter
writing booths appear in this .special Supplement. --

It is important that all levels of the University participate in‘START-
UP day. We either start up now, or pay later.

, IMPORTANCE OF THE /
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES

Several months ago, the University Administration explained Pitt's
financial needs to the Executive Branch of our State government. With
(or without) these needs in mind, the Governor's Office made a specific
recommendation concerning the State appropriation to Pitt.'The mqny
problems with that recommendation are now well known.  

The next governmental body to consider both the University's needs
and the Governor's recommendations will be the Appropriations
Committees in the State House of Representatives and the State Senate.
At the end of this month (April 23 and 24) these Committees will hear
testimony from University officials, student leaders, and other in-
térested individuals. Shortly thereafter, an’ appropriations bill for Pitt
will be drawn up by one or both of these committees. It is likely thdt the
amount specified in this bill will be accepfedby the entire legislature.

The need to contact your legislature becomes especially crucial if he
is a member of either. of the appropriations committees. A list of the
members of these committees is available at each letter-writing station.
See if your Representative or Senator is on the list..

The particular time--‘before the

in for irony (the morning after, and
all that), and to give the audiences

Producer Papp Pounds

New Policy: Wrong Kind

BY TOBI ROSEN‘

“...No other tool of civilization can provide the kind of perception that

i the writer brings to bear on the crisis in us in our society. The living

playwright therefore is a resource we must treasure, nourish and
produce. He speaks to us and for us. The Beaumont (Theatre) at
Lincoln Center shall be his major platform."

Bullshit.

Or so it seems. »
When idols come crashing down, they hit harder than most people.
And Joseph Papp, producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival, has
struck the earth's core. Just three weeks ago, Papp renigged on his
“New Plays for Old” policy. It seems we have been sold up the
“classical” river. _ .
Beginning next season, the Lincoln Center lineup switches from a
platform for new American playwrights to a shrine for the classicists.

As if Shakespeare had no where else to go.

But where are the new playwrights to go? Old and‘ now familiar
Pappian proteges such as David Rabe or Michael Weller will remain in
the arms and workshops of Papp’s Public Theatre. But after a while,
playwrights like these and others have earned the public’s (and critics’)
praise. But the tide of public opinion has turned. And so has Papp.

No longer does he vow to defy public scorn as he “reﬂects the great
issues of our time.” Papp peddled his play not to “fit” an audience,
but for the audience to “fit” the play. Young people, blacks, Puerto
Ricans--these_ are the people he wanted to attract, to put on plays by,
with‘ and for. i ’

And he did so quite successfully, for a while. Short Eyes was dubbed
“Best American Play” in 1974. Sticks and Bones received numerous
awards, including a Tony or two. That Championship Season sent the
-mailman ﬂying to the home of Jason Miller, where he received a
Pulitzer Prize. And so Papp grew content. Perhaps too content.

So the ivory towers grew higher and stronger. After irate public and
critical reaction to this season’s opener, Anne Burr’s Mert and Phil,
with Bill Gunn’s Black Picture Show second on the bill, activity at the
box office cooled considerably. Yet he denies money is a factor ,
responsible for his change of heart. But the audiences of Philadelphia
and New York did little to relinquish their disapproval. For a big
money-maker such as Papp’s A Doll’s House, starring Liv Ullmann,
they flocked to the uptown theatre in droves. ‘ '

Papp got allthe positive reinforcement to last for many seasons to
come. And so he’s decided to repeat his act. Liv Ullmann will headline
next year’s lineup, starring in Shaw’s St. Joan. Others expected to
grace the Beaumont Stage are Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Vanessa
Redgrave. Be expected to experience (that’s the only proper word)

Robert Redford and Barbara Streisand in The Taming of the Shrew.” L ‘

In a Pitt News interview dated February 4, 1975 Papp mentioned a
play he had always loved--Trelwany of the Well. In reference to/his
afore play policy,-he said, “Oh, I love old plays (Trelwany)-. Butif I5 =
have to make a decision whether to do an old play or a new one--if I
must make that choice--I’ll do a new play. Because then, I’m
furthering the present life of the theatre.” ’ -

Arthur Wing Pinero’s Trelwany of the Walls will adorn the classic‘?-,2’
catastrophe that Papp has brewing for Lincoln Center. I ’

“Furthering the present life of the theatre,” hah. Stagnation is" just
one of the serious repercussions that will hinder. the growth of
American theatre. ‘ ,

‘Papp has been stashing letters of enthusiasm‘ from subscribers
offering redemption to a man who has learned the lesson of his errored
ways. Cheers of “Hurrah” are exclaimed by the crowds. But tl"c
victory is a shallow one. - ' ’ '

Shampoo is not a movie many
people will enjoy. Women will be
repulsed and men will be angered
by the ridiculous super-macho role
they see portrayed. Unless they

while the strings echoed the theme
repeatedly with the brass. Then the
mood changed to one of lyrical and
reminiscent qualities.

The Andante used only strings

survivors. Stepford Wives doesn’t
even come close to matching that
tacky sci-ﬁ ﬁlm classic. ‘

Now back to the fantasy from the
Hollywood we all know and love.
The Four Musketeers is a “big"
movie in the old sense of cast,
settings and grandiose storylines
that Cecil B. DeMille thrived one.

As you may know, Four Muske-
teers is not really a sequel to last
year’s highly successful (and
enjoyable) Three Musketeers.
Rather, the two were filmed
together and then split apart to
make two movies and double the
producers’ pleasure at the box
ofﬁce. So Four is more a
continuation or, rather than a
sequel to, Three.

Four Musketeers is less ornate
and overwhelming but richer in
ironies, going. full circle, in
essence, to the original state of
affairs in Three Musketeers. Four
also relies much’ less on its huge
“all star_” cast of glittery figures
and more on those few, cast
members who can act.

Principal among ‘these is Faye
Dunaway as the deliciously male-
volent Milady, whose quest for"
vengeance against D’Artagnan
:Michael York) gives the film
subtitle. Dunaway’s sultry, sexy
methods of convincing give evil a

good name once more. Virtue was —

never so dull by comparison.
The movie is filled. with the plots

areligious war that gets its due in
fine, satiric lines, dryly delivered
by Aramis (Richard Chamberlain).

The Four Musketeers is more of
an adventure than a real story, as
there is little concern for the
individuals involved than for the
tapestry weaved by the entire look
of the movie“ Death, even when it
happens to the" “good guys,” is
seen as no less‘ tragic than the
many deaths incurred in the
upheavals of the times.

This flick is more serious in
subject matter than the light-
hearted romp that preceded it, and
the many ironies help it transcend
the realm of comic costume
spectaculars. The humor is seen as
more wry and human than the false
comedy usually associated with this

genre, and the slapstick is cut to a

minimum (as are the appearances.  if 
of Raquel Welch and York, the-_ ,8  

chief practicioners of that worn-out
device). — '

So The Four Musketeers is an,’ 
enjoyable movie, all right, and _' 
manages to be more than just a" 

mindless comedy. But please don't '

be mistaken that this is a “family 8 A 8‘

    Pgh. Lacrasseﬂlub
0ff and Sticking  

BY G. W. STEVENS >* .
Over the past few "years, the
number of colleges and universities
with varsity lacrosse teams has
increased greatly as more and more
5*?-§.Americans discover the ‘excitement
of Canada’s first national sport.
There also has been "a recent
increase in the number of club
teams. A local squad, the Pitts-
burgh Lacrosse Club, recently
started its 1975 season. '
Lacrosse is a fascinating game
invented well over two hundred
 years ago by North American
‘ A’; i'\Indians. At that time, the rules
were not well-defined and it was
not unusual for entire villages to
participate in the game. Often
there were no boundaries and the
length of the field varied from
several hundred yards to several

miles. Games sometimes went-on '

for _days.
The sport interested early settlers
in the colonies and Canada, and
More people began participating in
‘ the brutal action.— Later, when
many club teams were formed, the
rules were adjusted and the sport
began to resemble «its present
form.
— The game is played now on a field
about 100 yards long and 75 yards
wide, which extends several yards
beyond the goal, to facilitate play

- behind the net, The goal crease-

surrounds the entire goal. Protec-
tive equipment is used to prevent
injuries common to Indian partici-

pants. and the most important‘

piece is a helmet -with a bird
‘ cage-type face mask.

The object of the game is to put
the ball in the net. Players use a
stick, or crosse, with a netted end
enabling the players to either carry

the ball, pass it, or fire a shot. The
ball is made of compressed rubber
andcan be shot at great speeds.
The game is extremely fast-paced,
with lots of hard hitting and
aggressive, wide open play. There

are ten players on each team, and -

every one is given a particular, area
for which he is responsible, al-
though players often switch off to
help each" other out, much like in
"soccer or hockey. The game is
extremely exciting and the specta-
tors are often caught up in the
-exuberanceof the game.
The Pittsburgh Lacrosse Club
started its season two weeks ago
and is currently 2-0, with lopsided
victories over Carnegie-Mellon and
~West Virginia. The team, a
member of a league comprised
primarily of‘ teams from Ohio
(although one league team is from
Chicago), is made up of graduates
of prep-school and varsity lacrosse
programs. They play an exciting
game with style and ability.

The team practices and plays its
home games in Pitt Stadium.
Practice seeesions are every Mon-
day and Thursday at 6 pm and are
often as exciting as“ the games
themselves. ‘

The squad's next two games will
be at Cleveland April 6 and
‘Bethany April 12. Thevteam’s next
home-game will be a league contest
against Marietta Sunday, April 13
at 1 pm. The squad also will play
-two more home games this month
against Allegheny and Bethany
April 26 and 27, respectively. The
Allegheny contest will be at 9 am
and the Bethany contest at 1 pm.
There is no admission fee for home
games.

The Pitt football squad will have
its hands full this year when it
visits Norman, Oklahoma to do
battle with the Sooners; It's bad
enough to play in a stadium where
all the people ‘look like bloodsoaked
bodies. But what's worse, Okla-
homa Univesity (OU) has the power
to make every team it plays just as
red. I '

The Sooners lost 35 lettermen
from last year’s undefeated squad.
This may sound like a large group,
but 38 are returning--21 defensive
and 17 offensive players.

Head Coach Barry Switzer plans
search for replacements for the 10
starters lost to graduation. Rod
Shoate, the_ Sooners‘ three-year
All-American. and Gary Gibbs
were lost _from the linebacking
corps. .Randy Hughes,_ an All-

‘American safety, and left_ corner‘-
back Tony Peters were also defen-
sive stalwarts on the team that led
the nation in rushing, total offense
and scoring in 1974.

Ron Waters, a strong defensive
end. also is gone. On offense, the
entire left side of the line will be
missing. _

During spring ball Switzer will be

taking long looks at redshirt soph-
omore Obie Moore, senior» Jamie
Thomas, and sophomore Russ Wil-
liamson to fill the linebacker du-
ties. _ - .

Tight end is a problem for the
Sooners because two-year man
Wayne Hoffman, who caught six

passes for 98 yards in '74. has left]

for the real world.

Keith Thomas.’ a junior college
transfer. will be tried ‘at the
position. but
question. as he is coming off a
knee injury.

Dennis Buchanan, another red-
shirt,‘ will be the next Sooner
center. Chez Evans and Jaime
Melendex are expected to fill the
offensive tackle and guard posi-
tions. . M

In the backfield only the right
halfback position is vacant. Grant
Burget. _who was sixth in rushing

- and second in scoring last year. has

departed. His backup, Elvis Pea-
cock. actually rushed for more
yards than Burget (432 to 392).
However. Horace Ivory. a junior-
college transfer from Navarro, is
expected to push Peacock’s tail
feathers for a starting position.

Coach Switzer deﬁnitely lost some
key people, but what he has
returning will make any opposing
coach turn his eyes skyward for
help.

For starters--how about Joe
Washington? Although only 5’11.”
and» 180 pounds, “Little Joe” ran
for 3,124 yards---1-,320 of them last
year--and finished third in the
Heisman Trophy balloting. I

Washington needs only 744 yards
to break the record of former
Oklahoma back Steve Owens’, now
the the pro Detroit Lions, and
should get it rather easily.

To no one’s surprise, the
University of Southern California
won its second consecutive NCAA.
swimming title, edging second-

. place Indiana by nearly 100 points.

Tennessee finished third in total
team points, Alabama fourth, and
UCLA fifth.

The Pitt Panthers‘ representa-
tives, although competitive in some
events, failed to score in the
three-day meet last weekend at

‘ Cleveland State. ‘

Jerry DeMuro ﬁnished 30th in the
1650-yard freestyle, his time nearly
twenty seconds behind his personal

‘high of 16:04.38.

“I think it was a very fine meet for
us,” said Coach Dick Bradshaw.
“Most of the kids came off the best
times of’ their careers in the
Eastems, and I think they were a

little intimidated by some of the‘

competition there.-

“It was quite an experience, and I
think we can be more competitive
in the future. Everyone swam
about the second-best times
they've ever had. I- wasn't

‘ disappointed at all." V

Diver Dave Reeder finished
thirtieth out of 90 in the
three-meter diving event. He was
ranked as the third best freshman
in the diving competition.

“The divers were pretty good in
general,” Bradshaw said. “They
made a "few little mental errors, and
you really can’t do that with. the
competition they were up against.

“We‘ve had the best season in
Pitt history this year. All but one
pool record was broken and new

7 team records were set in "every

t

   

event.‘ We finished second in the
Penn State Relays and second Ill‘
the Easterns, places where Pitt
swimming has never been before.

“Eric Shultz is our only loss for
next season and I know the guys we
have will be better next year.- We
are recruiting for next season right

now, so anyone we pick up will be

icing on the cake."

The University of Pittsburgh will
host the Midwest Intercollegiate
Synchronized, Swimming Routine
Championships for the first time
Saturday and Sunday at Trees Hall.
Pitt will compete against nearly 25
universities and colleges.

Ohio State and the University of
Michigan, two big rivals and
members of the Big Ten, will
participate with schools from Wis-
consin, New York, Illinois,‘ Penn-
sylvania, Ohio and Michigan.

Ohio State is the Midwest team

champion, and the University of

Michigan is close behind. The
favorites are bringing more than a
hundred members to the meet.
The routine competition will be
divided into solos, duets, trios and
teams, which consist of at least four
girls. Pitt will be competing in six
different routines, the largest
number it has ever entered.

BY ANDY BEHREND
Associate Sports Editor
‘E The Pitt Athletic Department has
‘graciously granted its baseball
team a mindboggling total of 18
‘games. Eighteen measly games.
That’s not 18 different teams,
mind you. Naw, that would be too
-much to hope for. Three teams [U.
of Buffalo, Clarion St. and
Westminster] will play double-
headers with Pitt, while _one
squad--West Virginia--has four
games scheduled with the Pan-
thers. '

' Eighteen games are hardly

enough for a player to break a
sweat over‘, much less perform at a
high level. It is often the case that
I aballplayer will not reach his stride
until half a dozen or so contests
have been played. At Pitt, a.few
0-4 games at the plate can fluff up a
batting average for the whole
season.

Protests Assistant Coach Luis
Olavez “There is.no way a player
can develop his skills over 18
“games. A scout will look at the
kid’s schedule and see only 18
, games and that's no indication of
what a player can do.”

The players obviously are distur-
bed by the lack of games.

 Senior hurler Buster Popovich

' said, “The schedule is very
inadequate for a school this size.

, Teams like Temple have played
‘something like 30 games by the
time we play them.”

When the teams met last year,
Temple was 17-8. Pitt was 3-5.
j Several members expressed out-
‘rage at getting to play so few
games to compliment the amount
at practice time put in.

as Few Games lrk Players

“You work so hard for it and then
you only get to play 13 games,”
said Don Siegle, another senior
pitcher. Siegle was referring to last
year’s preposterous
when, after rainouts, 13 games
were played.

One has to sympathize even

further with Coach Bobby -Lewis. '

Because of the miniscule schedule,
he's forced to play every game with
his nine best men, with little or no
substituting.

The players aren’t‘ biting the
hands that feed them because they
really aren’t being nurtured. Many
of the guys are aware the Athletic
Department would like to flush
them out of the whole ‘spring
picture period. The hints lack

schedule,_

subtlety. The report from the man
sitting in _that office ‘over in the
Field House that the team should
cut down on the use of baseballs.
Huh? That's about the only speck
of equipment the team has left. Do
you think he realizes the team
practices with cracked bats? Nah.

It’s not unlike beating your head
against a brick wall. Just insert an
unsupple mind for the wall.

And, after all the outrage and
disgust, maybe a lighter look at the
problem can alleviate some pain.
Perhaps first baseman _Lynn
“Thor" Nystrom has the solution.
"I think we ought to cut it down;
let's play a double-header and call
it a season." - A

Sadly, it may come to that.

All-State Hoop Team

AP State Sports Editor
“Awesome" is the way scholastic
basketball experts describe Gene
Banks, 15-year-old sophomore at

West Philadelphia High School

who was among those named
Wednesday to the 1974-75 Assoc-
iated Press All-Pennsylvania High
School Basketball Team.

In addition to Banks, sports
writers and television and radio
sports directors throughout the
state selected to‘ the first team,
Wayne Williams of Pittsburgh
Schenley’s PIAA Class A cham-
pions, Abington ace Richard
Wright, Bill Keys "of Bristol, Ed
Scheuermann from Baldwin, and
Tyrone’s Nick Leasure.

The voters picked a second team
of Valley's Baron Flenory, Penn

A Hall Academy's Dave,Beckom, Ed

DiRugeris of Bensalem Township,
Lonnie McClain of West Mifﬂin
North, and Bill Cashaw from
Aliquippa. .

The third team consists of Pat
Flannery of Pottsville, Northwest's
Joe Hasay, Dana Perno of
Uniontown, Johnny Moore from
Altoona and Hazleton’s Larry Sock.»

Six players were picked on the
first team because of the closeness
of the balloting.

E Banks, who could be the_youngest

player" ever to make an All-Star
team (age records aren’t kept),
averaged 15.2 points. and 19
rebounds per game. ‘He had 24
points and 25 rebounds in West
Philadelphia’s city championship
victory. '

A "West Philly coach Joey Golden-
_ berg says of Banks: “He’s the best

‘Pittsburgh Schenley.

player in Philadelphia since Andre
McCarter," referring to the
brilliant guard who guided UCLA
to the NCAA title Monday night.
Goldenberg says that Banks is
capable of averaging 30 points or
more a game, but that West
Philadelphia had other good
scorers, and didn’t have to go to its
6’6” ace for_points. _,
“He is effective out of both the
low and high post, and can come
outside a zone and pop in 20-foot
jumpers," Goldenberg says.
“He's «super quick and plays
excellent defense. He could play at
some colleges now, and he hasn’t
yet played his best game. He is
going to be a super player.”
Williams, a 6'3” senior, averaged
15 points and 15 rebounds for
His coach,
Spencer Watkins,
Williams as a “very unselfish

-player who" gave up the ball too

much. He had a great attitude,
excellent temperment and was a
leader." Williams averaged eight
assists and eight steals per game as
Schenley posted a 25-3 record.
Abington’s Wright, a 5’l0”
guard, completed his varsity carer
with 1,700 points, scoring 50 in the
final regular season game. His
forte, however, wasn’t scoring,
rather playmaking. Schenley coach
Watkins says his team concentra-
ted on Wright in the PIAA title
game. “We felt he was the key to
Abington’s game,” Watkins said.
Abington coach Jim Wilkinson
said of Wright, “He’s the finest
guard I've seen in 15 years of

_ coaching.” That's not exactly faint

praise, since Wilkinson coached at
Wilkinsburg High and saw such

The pads that protect all vulner-
able bones, althotfgh made of such
mundane material as horsehair,
rubber, leather and plastic, carry a
hefty pricetag. Defensemen gener-
ally plaster themselves from the

pads, chest protectors, knee wraps,
leg tape, shin guards and ankle
guards do the job for the men who
prostrate themselves in front of
pucks traveling at more than 100
miles an hour. ~ 1

Shin pads are $35. Elbowpads are
$20. Shoulder pads are $25.] Even
with $300 worth "of safety equip-
ment, defensemen collect bruises
and broken ‘bones with alarming
regularity.

Even those sawed-off pants are

Skating is what hockey is all
about. And so the skates are an

cost up to $100. While amateur

5 this year, where his team had an
8-P18 record.

, -There are reports here that
2 Morgan, who 'realizes no man can

'-replace Wooden, already has
decided on a replacement.
'; Regardless, the Bruins and

.TVVoo_den could bask in another of
their ﬁnest hours, a 10th national
championship in 12 years, one
C. which came 92-85 over a physical
‘ Kentucky team that gave UCLA all
9'" it’wanted.

s,In the end, it was Wooden’s
virtuoso performance, and the skill
" with which his final class executed
it,_,that made the difference.
“There was no way that we were
ggoing to lose the coach's last
 game,” said guard Andre Mc-
Carter, who had 14 assists and ran
the tempo of the game the way
- Wooden wanted it--ﬁrst fast, then
-slow, then fast again. It kept the
' Bruins one step ahead of the
Wildcats.

; Wooden used just six players to
7 /Kentucky’s 10, defying the Wild-
Jcats’ muscle and depth with
',“ri'iu’scle, quickness, condition’ and
finesse. Dave Meyers, Rich
" Washington, Pete Trgovich and
McCarter played all 40 minutes.
,.No Kentucky —player did, and the
"experts would have told you that
would wear UCLA down.

 The Bruins’ single substitute--
—“~'7’1” Ralph Drollinger--played 16
3 -minutes. But Kentucky Coach Joe
i_B. H/all .thought he was the

P:rg¢;.i8—“TiiE'. PITT NE'ws—‘wed..esday, April 2, I975

key man. Drollinger had 10 points
and 13 rebounds.

The emotion of the game became
most evident to the 15,153 who
packed the San Diego Sports Arena
when Meyers fouled Kevin Grevey.
Meyers banged his hand on the
floor and was slapped with a
technical.

Wooden was furious, shouting
madly for some time at official
Hank Nichols. His team’s 10-point
lead had been cut to one at 76-75

and now Kentucky had a chance for
ﬁve points--the free throws plus
possession.

They got none. Grevey, who had
34 points, missed the free throws
and his team committed an
offensive foul before it could get a
shot offf .

“I was upset on the call because I
felt Grevey went under me as I got
off a shot,” said Meyers, whose 24
points were second for the Bruins
to Washington’s 28.

UCLA Tops Final

BY ALEX SACHARE
AP Sports Writer

UCLA, which made Coach John
Wooden’s farewell to college
basketball a memorable one by
beating Kentucky 92-85 for the
NCAA championship, is the No. 1
team in the nation according to The
Associated Press‘ ﬁnal poll of the
1974-75 season.

But the vote was not unanimous.

The Bruins, winners of the
collegiate championship in 10 of
the past 12 years, received 45‘/2 of
49 first-place votes from a
nationwide panel of sports writers
and broadcasters.‘ UCLA's total of
969 points gave the Bruins first
place by a wide margin‘ over
runnerup Kentucky, which pulled
down 830» points in the balloting
announced Tuesday. _

UCLA, which ﬁnished its season
with-3,28-3 record, succeeds North
Carolina State, No. 1 in the ﬁnal

poll last year. It is the seventh timer

UCLA had ﬁnished in the top spot,
all in the past 12 years under

Wooden, who announced last
weekend’ his retirement from
coaching after a total of 40

seasons. The Bruins also have
ﬁnished second in the poll three
times in the past 12 years.

North Carolina State had‘ ' been
picked No. 1 in the preseason poll,
with UCLA No. 2. /

Trailing Kentucky, 26-5, in the
balloting was Indiana, which

BY YAIER LEHRER
—The American League East will be
very exciting this season, with the
race for the divisional crown going
down to the wire.

_,-rint, though, will be New York
"and Baltimore, and the results of
the race will be as follows:

1. NEW YORK YANKEES--The
Yanks made a strong rush for the
title last season only to ﬁnd
Baltimore was much stronger. The
acquisition of Jim “Catﬁsh” Hunt-
er and Bobby Bonds in the off-sea-
son should change all that.

In Hunter,’ the Yanks have a

pitcher who has won 20 games or —

more in each of the last four

seasons. In Bonds, they have a

solid ﬁelder and powerful batsman,
_ not to mention a great speedster on
Y the bases.

a-/~‘~with the addition of C/atﬁsh, the

Yankshave the best mound staff in
the division and possibly in all the
American League. George “Doc”

Medich and Pat Dobson were both’

19-game winners last season, and
with Rudy May (8-4, 2.28 ERA),
Mike Wallace (6-0, 2.41) and Larry
' Gura (5-1, 2.41), the Yanks have

depth and quality among their

starters.

Quality is not only in the starters, I

but in the relieving‘ staff as well,
with ace Sparky Lyle leading the
way. Lyle was 9-3, with-pa 1.66 ERA
last season and he should match
that performance_this year.

 Although the Yankees have depth
’ unfortunately ,

in pitching, they
have -none in the inﬁeld. If
anything leads to the Yanks’ down-

fall this season, it will be the"

inﬁeld.

Chris Chambliss,‘ Sandy Alomar-,
Jim Mason and Craig-Nettles make
up the ~ mediocre interior, and
except for Nettles’ 22 home runs

‘st season, their offensive statis-
tics are as poor as their defensive.

'0 The Yankees’ outﬁeld is excellent. L _> - -  p I 1 - "

GRADUATE STUDENTS--h-Special Discount Rate for

The Yanks boast Bonds in right
field, Lou Piniella (.305 average-9
home runs-70 RBIs) in left and the

excellent-ﬁelding Elliot Maddox. 

(.303-3-45) in center. .
In .the designated hitting depart-
ment, the Yanks have a benchful of

solid hitters. Alex Johnson,’ Ron I

_ Probably , the '
.--f"*<.o.r;_1y teams around for the ﬁnal

Orioles and Yankees will leave the
rest of the division far behind, but
when all is said and done, the
Orioles will fall just short in the
area where the Yankees are the
strongest, pitching.

Four-time 20-game winner Mike

« Cuellar, who won 22 last season,

will lead the pitching staff. Ross
Grimsley, who turned in a good
performance last year, winning 18

games with a 3.07 ERA, also will be ‘

back. The Birds gambled when
they traded Dave McNally for‘Mike
Torrez, but probably got the best of
the deal. Any pitcher who can-win
15" games with a team like the
Expos has to have 20-game poten-
tial. _ ,

The big question mark for the
Oriole pitchingstaff is Jim Palmer.
Palmer has been great in the past
but is coming off «a season chock
_full of arm trouble. If he comes
through, the Orioles just might
take the division title from the
Yankees. .

Although the Orioles’ pitching is
not as good as the Yankees’, their
inﬁeld is far superior. Lee. May,
Bobby,Grich, Mark Belanger and
the great Brooks Robinson provide

both offense and‘ solid defense.
Not only do the Birds have a solid

inﬁeld, but their outﬁeld includes

Paul Blair, the ﬁnest defensive

outﬁelder today. Blair, Don Baylor I
and Ken Singleton (acquired in the —

McNally deal) give the Orioles ﬁne
-defense, and the addition of Sin-
gleton will give the outﬁeld power,

. something it has lacked sorely.

3. BOSTON RED SOX-- The Sox
are completely outclassed by the
Yankees and Orioles, as is the rest
of the division, but they have the
talent to at least make a symbolic
run at the pennant. I

Luis Tiant will lead the Boston‘

team again, and this year his
catcher may be the injury-plagued
Carlton Fisk, probably, the best
catcher in the American League.

The entire Boston team," except"

for Tiant, ' suffered through a
mediocre season at best last year,
but the talent is there. Carl
Yastremski, Rick -Wise, Reggie
Cleveland, Doug Grifﬁn and Rice
Petrocelli will provide the Red Sox
with a balanced attack, but it won’t
be enough to overtake the front

is plenty of young talen on the team
in Darrel Porter and Robin Yount.
There are also seasoned veterans
such as Don Money, who last year
came in second to Brooks Robinson
in the Golden Glove balloting. ,_

The Brewers have a ﬁne defensive
inﬁeld in George Scott, Pedro
Garcia, Yount and Money. Money
and Scott have good offensive
statistics as well, but Yount and
Garcia will have to improve their
offensive performance. ’

Pitching is the glaring Milwaukee
weakness. Jim Colborn, a 20-game
wirmer in 1973,. dropped to a 10-13,
mark last season. The bright
spot_ on the mound staff is Ed
Sprague, who Finished last season

' with a 7-2 record and a ‘2.39 ERA.

He and Billy Champion [11-4] could
emerge as the staff leaders.

Parking

(Continued from Page 8)

Plaza lot are students, 12% are
public and 10% are instructors or
other workers. The destination of
90% of the users is the Cathedral,
Hillman Library of Carnegie
Museum or Library. ‘

‘Building on an earlier study of
Oakland's parking needs, Ramp V_
estimates that with the displacé;.if{,j‘{‘..»-
ment of the present Schenley P12.-"fl-’i '

-lot,,there will be a total need for

almost 1900 parking spaces in the
Schenley Plaza Study Area, which

extends about 1300 feet north, east‘

and west of the Schenley lot. Ramp
notes this ultimately will call for
two 900-space lots in the area.
This takes ‘into account the
450-space garage planned in the
Professional Quadrangle Building
now under construction, the report
states.
