tend. ‘The tickets will be $2.50 per
plate. 5

the guest list.» This will include all
the 1913 graduates who join the
Alumni Association before that time.
The membclrship fce is $2.00 per
"year, but t is is on y ' mi al, as it

most the whole ‘fee. ~ All graduates
should take advantage of this oppor-
tunity to become acquainted with the
fellow alumni. ’

the “Report ‘of the Economic Survey

worth, Dean of the School of Eco-
nomics. .

In part-the article says:

“Pittsburgh has been surveyed and
re—surveyed by socialworker, by- city
planner, by industrial engineer, and

lastly by an economist.‘ This latest
survey is unique. It was undertaken
at the mstatwe of the Mayor and

Council of the City of Pittsburgh in
order -to investigate conditions here
and. compare them with those in
other cities. In the short time at his
disposal Dr. I-Ioldsworth has pro-

There has been a crying need for

for sometime,’ and a long-standing
gap will be ﬁlled when the club gets
in actual operation. ~

' A "meeting" will be .held Monday
morning at 10:30 in -Room 107 Thaw

object of this club is to study the
present day civic problems. There
are already l8"chapters among the
big universities, like Columbia’ and
New York ‘University, and the stu-
dents ‘ih these schools make an ex-
tensive study of the modern~ civic
questions. Such a club is a very nec-
essary thing in Pitt, since the school

where many of these problems pre-
S.'lt themselves.

of the Salem High School" in the

‘rooms of the Calumet Club. The
.musicians returned to Pittsburgh

school, and its graduates by “big
business” and industrial concerns all
over the country. The demand for
University of Pittsburgh engineers is
greater this year than ever. Every
mernber,of the senior class of the’
school ‘is assured of a position for
next year, and there have been twen-
ty-four requests from big concerns
for electrical engineers, which could
not be ﬁlled. Great plants, like the
Westinghouse Company, are willing
to snap up every young man that

. ' SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR

STUDENT DEBT

As a last appeal t-0 the students for
a fund to liquidate the indebtedness
various organiza-
tions of'the -University, the authori-
ties have passed among the students

.. ,a. printed card which may be ﬁlled

ou_t, pledging so much of this debt, to
be paid before commeilcement. The

.Cap and Gown club performance did‘

notraise enough money to meet this

debt. .The assessment of 50 cents per ‘

capita, ,which-has been passed, has
thus far failed to materialize the cash.
There seems but one means by which
to raise this money at present. This
is by popular subscription among the
students. A small contribution from
each student will not break any one
and it will greatly assist, regardless

T-HE ‘PITT WEEKLY 

it is ever to be done.

coLLEGE SPIRIT

 

The college press, bpth weekly and
daily, is ﬁlled fr-om time to time with
discourses on -the topic of “College
Spirit” ﬁnd even the dailies and
na;iona.l papers take occasional ﬂings
at the much discussed question. The
strange part of the innumerable
columns written about the attribute
of college life is that when all is said
and done no one knows with any
more deﬁniteness the real meaning of
the term.

It is perfectly proper to admit that
college spirit is intangible, it is inde-
ﬁnable and must"be experienced to
comprehend the true conception of
the term. In its presence there is
the ‘uncontrollable desire to burn
fences, to tear down buildings and
make things ﬂy. A sweet intoxication
of the care free youth which looks to
higher education for support. .

The common appreciation does not
permit the things of the intellect to
be in the background. Enthusiasm
for debatesand incessant study -is_.not
generally considered the true applica-
tion _ for college a spirit. Athletics,
clubs, politics and fraternities -seem to
beithe main support of the nebulus

‘asset of the average college man. It

is ‘not surprising therefore that col-
lege spirit is a foible, a fad, and a
whim, tolerated by an indulgent array
of ‘college profs.

But the educational support is the
means '
points of higher education, which can-
not -be learned in books, nor lectures
and which form a great inﬂuence for
future life; namely, loyalty, devotion,
and unity of purpose.

These are a few qualities which col-
lege spirit instills into the mind of

a youth to-day. Success in after life‘

is greatly tided by aﬁrm belief in
one’s calling, and absolute adherence

to -it and the power of sticking to it.

-Examination time reminds us that
it is easier to keep up tham to catch

up.

 

Genius and hard work ‘run an un-
equal race.

 

True character is not born of blood.

 

To be successful‘ in your studies, be
sure that you_are “from well to bet-
ter, daily self-surpast.’’

_ in time, the work
shows discrimination and the careful
elimination of nOn—essentials in the
material presented.

“Almost unconsciously we compare

 

Lthis survey with one made almost six

years ago. The earlier survey, not
yet published, revealed“ in dismal col-
Ors the weaknesses of industrial
Pittsburgh. It pointed out remedies
only by implication. This later sur-
vey, much less pretentious, aims to
build up a better municipal person-
_ each problem and
suggesting a way out of the difﬁ-
culty.”

 

FALSE RUMORS

 

Some rumors have been‘ published
in the daily papers to the effect that
Pitt has received an appropriation of
$1,000,000 from the State. This has
not as.yet been deﬁnitely settled, and
THE VVEEKLY will publish a full

JAPANESE ‘AMBASSADOR
.;_ ADDRESSES Y. M. C. A.

v —-—.r'

George VV. Guthrie, our new am-
bassador to Japan, addressed the Y.
M. C. A. Monday morning at 10:30
on the “Moral Duty of the Citizens.”
Mr. Guthrie is a member of the class
of 1866 and a trustee of the Univer-
sity.

Mr. Guthrie‘ said: .

“In such‘ a land as this, every one
has a great moral duty to perform.
This is to preserve and hand down
to posterity al that has aided us in
our ‘advance t rough life. The foun-
dation of all true citizenship consists
in a high conception of this moral
duty.

a similar need will call them out
again. Indifference must be fought.
The government belongs to the peo-
ple and must be properly carried on
under their direction. Opposition will
be met to every change, but this must
be met and overcome. ~

“A strong, united, moral’ sentiment"

in the community forms one of the
strongest elements in carrying out
this duty. The«colleges are furnish-
ing the men trained to an apprecia-
tion of this higher conception. This
is shown in. the advance of the na-
tion. On the power to go where duty
leads ‘us depends the future of the
race. If the opposition is too strong,
the advance may be a tidal wave in
order to accomplish changes, but we
must hope for the best.”

Mr. Guthrie was ably introduced by
Dr. F. N. Thorpe, and Chancellor
McCormick added his appreciation
and commendation. One of the
largestcrowds of the year came out
to greet Mr. Guthrie and all were
well pleased with his address.

The home of Dr. G. M. Flint at

there was present C. . Miller and

The banquet was" in honor of
Pitt’s victory ,over University‘ of
Pennsylvania last winter, and also in
payment of a bet on that game which
“Doc” Flint lo-st to “Capt." Camp-

ever and in such abundance that
“Johnny” Baker had to be dragged
from the table in order to make him
stop. eating. During the dinner
.“Babe” Graham and “Capt.” Camp-
bell got away with a number of jokes
and almost jokes, while _“Frish”

tried to get away with some silver-

was entertained by some piano and

VARSITY MAKES .
_ _ POOR. SHOWING

 

Three games played and ‘three
games lost was the record made by
"the University of Pittsburgh baseball
team on the trip that was taken last
week. When the players left the city

it was the opinion of many that. they '

would take two of the games to be
played on the trip, and that they
might take all of them. But the dope
went wrong and the team suffered
three consecutive defeats at thehands
of West‘ Virginia Wesleyan. How-
ever, it might have been worse—what
if four games had been played?

PITT DEFEATS

STATE IN ‘TENNIS

 

Pitt defeated Penn State ‘in’ tennis
last Saturday afternoon _by the score
of 6-0, on the Penn State courts. The
Blue and White was no match for the
fast team representing the University
of Pittsburgh. Pitt outclassed the

State team in every department of
the game and there was never a time
when the Pitt players, did not have
the situation completely under their
control. .

Pitt has not been very successful in
the games playe in other depart-
ments of athletics with the State col-
lege, and it was up to the tennis men
to ‘ make good in the match. The
members of the team went into the
match conﬁdent ’ of victory, feeling
that after the decisive manner “in
which they had defeated the Univer-
sity of Michigan that they would
have no trouble _in winning the match.

Summary of the match: "

Singles 1 -—e McElr0y (Pitt), D.
Nevin (State), 6-2, 6-2.

2——Wright (Pitt), D. Irish (State),

6-2, 6-3.

CAP NIGHT

. 1
Cap Night was celebrated with
great success?—to the committee and

‘to some yet unapprehehded miscreants

that -appropriated for their own mis-
erable selves all of the refreshments
that the committee and a few friends
had collected on the hill on the even-
ing of June 4th. All of the assem-
bled diginitaries being full of the pro-
vided ‘feast a worthy member moved
to adjourn. This was done sine die.
" About 8:15 on this eventful evening
it was reported to -the PITT
WEEKLY staff that three freshies
had appeared near the “Gym.” ‘A re-
porter was immediately sent to the
scene of the festivities. Soon the
members of ‘the committee of ar-
rangements-appeared laden with the
refreshments for the evening. By

A 8:45 o’clock about ﬁfty freshies and
, others had assembledvto take part in

the ceremony. The customary bon-
ﬁre was prepared. It was during this
part of the entertainment that the re-
freshments disappeared. The crowd
scattered in all directions to hunt the
thieves. The reporter raced here and
there as ‘each new clue was discov-
ered and followed to its end. De-
spite the urgings of the chief mar-
shal, the scgttered. freshies could not
rounded up. "The committee
therefore dismissed the initiator and
other dignitaries of the evening and
went home to dream of Cap Night as
it ought to be. V » "
