Commons Room Needs‘

The Saving Grace
Of Informality

By CLARENCE VVIBLE

The Commons Room is not
serving its purpose. Originally
intended by the Ui1iversit.y
architect and the powers that
be to serve as the living room
of the Cathedral, this room is
sleteriorating into a. public ban-
quet hall by night, a room with
stone walls and wooden benches
by day.

The University can not be
blamed for its failure to restrict
the use of the Commons Room to
the students of the University.

Although this room was never
planned for large receptions and
banquets, the need for a large
room where such gatherings may
be held has been so acute that the
University authorities have yielded
to necessity and have converted
the Common Room on several
occasions, into a reception room or
banquet hall.

Living Room, Lounge . . .

Then, too, outside pressure has
been brought to bear upon the
University authorities for the use
of this room in connection with
certain community projects.

If, however, the Commons Room
is to serve as a living room, or
lounge, for the students of the
University, certain deﬁnite steps
must be taken by the University
towards this purpose. Students
are encouraged to meet. study, and
lounge in the Commons Room.

With its .t'urnisl1ings of bare
wooden benches, no matter how
picturesque they may be, the room
is hardly conducive to casual loaf-
ing. Although the surroundings
may be more inspiring, as far as
comfort is concerned, one might as
well loaf on a curbstone.

The no-smoking regulations dis-
courage students i‘rom using the
Commons Room. Most of us who
smoke, smoke in the living—rooms
of our respective homes. Although
our homes may lack the dignity
and inspiration that is supposedly
distinctive of the Cathedral, yet
they do serve their purpose.
Insert Warmth . . .

Since the avowed purpose of the
Commons Room is to provide fa-
cilities for student study, recrea-
tion, and comfort, there is a cer-
tain inconsistency in the no-smok-
ing regulations, the hard seats, and
the frigidity of stone which nul-
lify the good intentions oi’ the Uni-
versity in creating this room.

Under the present policy of stu-
dent restriction, the room is des-
tined to an empty and useless fu-
ture. The Commons Room, now,
is cold and dead. It will become
progressively colder and stiffer if
there is not some action taken to
insert warmth and the saving
grace of infonnality into this room.
Let’s forget the dignity and beauty
for awhile, and concentrate on
utility.

It’s About Time
To Move In

WIIEREFORE, the Stephen Collins Foster
Memorial building?

Is it‘ to become solely a shrine for Fosteriana,
or are its auditorium and social hall to be used
for the beneﬁt of the University? ..

These are not rhetorical questions. They
become particularly pertinent as we are shown
speciﬁc applications of the regulations made
for the building by the University Board of
‘l‘rust'ees.

We were early informed that school organi-
zations may not use the basement hall of the
memorial, which is almost perfect for small
dances and social functions. These school
groups will continue to pay out of their meager
funds to local hotels.

Pitt Players, asking use of the tlieatrc for a.
beneﬁt performance for the Pittsburgh Pan-
Hellenic Association, were denied permission
on grounds of a trustee ruling that no beneﬁts
of any kind were to be allowed in the memorial.

In. view of the fact that the Players had used
the hall before, were a. University activity, and
the proceeds were to be taken by the Pan-Hel
Association, which each year awards a scholar-
ship to a. needful woman, it would seem that the
blanket ruling might have been pulled a little
in Players’ favor.

Even the Supreme Court grants that all laws
are applied equally, but they must be inter-
preted to ﬁt the circumstances. A

The Foster Memorial can become an integral
part of University life instead of a cold and
austere museum of relics. VVe do not see how

the memory of a man who sought happiness in A

song will be desecrated by dances and plays.

Symphony Cards
Russian Ballet

BY ESTELLE KOVACS

Concert-goers of the city are looking forward to
a gala three—day Thanksgiving music festival, No-
vember 25, 26, and 27, when the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony, in addition to its regular concerts Thursday
evening and Friday afternoon, joins with the Ballet
Russe de Monte Carlo in a one night performance
on Saturday.

Michel Gusikoff, concertmaster extraordinaire of
the Pittsburgh Symphony, will play the Lalo “Sym-
phonic Espagnole” for violin and orchestra, as the
feature of a brilliant program which includes also
the Franck Symphony in D Minor, Beethoven’s
Overture to “Coriolanus,” and Respighi’s Symphonic
Poem “Pines of Rome.”

Mr. Gusikoff has established a reputation as an
outstanding violinist and composer. Beginning with
the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, he served for
eight years until he was selected by Stokowski for
the Philadelphia Orchestra. Next he was secured
by Walter Damrosch for the New York Symphony,
where he continued until the merger with the New
York Philharmonic Orchestra. Gusikoff remained
under Walter Damrosch as concertmaster of the
NBC Symphony Orchestra. For the last few years
he has been appearing on the radio and with various
concert orchestras.

Among his compositions, ’ Gusikoff numbers a
concerto for violin and orchestra, which was played
last season by Efrem Zimbalist, and a new concerto,
which has been recently added to the repertoire of
J ascha Heifetz.

Carlos Chavez, young Mexican conductor and
composer, who was introduced to Pittsburgh concert
audiences a few weeks ago, when he ﬁrst came to
lead the Pittsburgh Symphony, will conduct.

Climaxing the musical diet for the week-end, the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, lead by Efrem
Kurtz, will play the scores for the Ballet Russe de
Monte Carlo, in a program including four ballets,
entirely new to Pittsburgh audiences. Among these
are “Jeux d’Enfants” to the music by Bizet, “Cho-
reartium" to the score of Brahm’s Fourth Symphony,-
“Le Spectre de la Rose” to Weber's “Invitation to
the Waltz,” and “Le Beau Danube” to Stauss’ “Blue
Danube Waltz.”

The Ballet Russe, long an unwanted child in the
musical world, has, in the last few years come. into
its: aesthetic own. The Ballet comes this week to
Pittsburgh straight from sensational success at the
Metropolitan Opera House in New York and a com-
mand performance before the King and Queen of
England at Covent Garden, London.

Editor, The Pitt News:
After Inquiry Forum Monday I was speaking
with Dr. Alexander. In his talk on the dangers of
syphilis, in which he discussed public curbing of
this national evil, Dr. Alexander mentioned one
pertinent fact which struck my attention: he said
hefelt the Wasserman tests conducted by The Pitt
News should be continued withoutcharge--and that
his office would cooperate with any extended pro-
gram of such a nature. _ ,
I asked Dr..Alexander whether the program would
be carried to other Pittsburgh colleges and he said
that it would, but that a wider range of investiga-
tion at Pitt would facilitate this program.
Under these circumstances, would it not be wise
to have a follow-up campaign of tests for students
who desire them, but who were not able to cooper-

   

ate in the last program? I think that it would-—for ‘

by doing this a wider percentage of the campus
would be covered. ‘ -
_ -—John E. Fritzmeier, C39.
Editor's note: The possibility of a follow-up
program will be investigate'd.‘_~,W ‘ ’  " . - ,

End Season 

With Duke

Saturday’s Game

in South Closes

Pitt Grid Season.

Marching into Dixie, Coach
-Jock Sutherland takes his
football forces down to Dur-
ham, North Carolina tomor-

-row to play their ﬁnal game of
the year against the sleek Blue
Devils of Duke University Sat-
urday afternoon in the park-en-
closed Duke Stadium.

In many ways this contest will
be the most important the Pan-
thers have been called upon to
play thus far in a season that has
‘been compacted with hard, tough
Saturday afternoons.

First of all, there is the matter
+01‘ national rating. At the present
moment, Pitt has been awarded
‘the number one gridiron position
in the national scene. Along with
that goes the top ranking in the
East, and, also, there may be an
invitation to play a little more
football this semester.

FINAL EXAM

Then, too, despite a none too
‘impressive record, the Southland-
ers have a very good team with
which to give the Panthers their
.scason’s last quiz.

For the fifth time this year, Pitt
will perform before a capacity.
crowd. According to reports from
'..Durham, there still remain a few
thousand tickets to be sold, but
‘the manner in which they have
been leaving the ticket office indi-
cates that the Duke horsehoe will

Wallace Wade, Duke football
coach, has followed the suit of his

had Pitt on their schedule. He has
‘ pointed his team for the game
with Pitt, as did nine other
coaches this season.

That psychological factor, al-
‘will be on the hometown boys’
side. They also have the advan-
‘tage of playing in their own ter-
ritory, a determing factor when
you go down below the Mason-
‘Dixon line.

PANTHERS ENTRAIN

Undefeated, but tied, the Pan-
thers will play a team Saturday
that has. only lost one game.
Duke was defeated two weeks
ago by a strong North Carolina
‘team, 14-6. This was one of those
games, similar to the Pitt con-
tests with Duquesne and Tech,_
where two neighbors get together
and anything happens.

Incidentally, the Panthers, leav-
ing Pittsburgh tomorrow after-
noon at 1 o’clock will arrive in
Chapel Hill, North Carolina early
"Friday morning. Chapel Hill IS
the home of North Carolina Uni-
versity and the Panthers will be
quartered there until shortly be-
fore game time, as it is only a,
few miles from Durham.

Players Present
Airlines Drama
In Foster Hall

Tickets go on sale today for
“(.‘:eili1ig' Zero,” Pitt Players’
second play of the season,
V\'lll(".ll will he presented \.’\="e<l-
n-esday and 'l‘l1ursda;x' evenings,
l)ece1'nher 8 and 9, - 111 the
Stephen Foster Memorial.

Meinlncrs of the cast, will.
have tickets for sale. Tickets can
also be secured from any member
of the Players’ business staff. from
any active member of t.he Players,
or from Alice Beatty in the dean
of men’s office, according to James
Davis, E39, business manager of
the Players.

GROUP RATES

In addition to these customary
sources for tickets, many of the
women’s fraternities are taking ad-
vantage of the reduced group rate
price, 35 cents per ticket for groups
of ten or more, by appointing a
member to act as sales manager
within the respective fraternities.

Men’s fraternities and other or-
ganizations can secure this group
rate also and should send their
representative to business man-
ager Davis in the Players’ ofﬁce,
1617 Cathedral, as soon as possi-
ble. The regular price of admis-
sion is 50 cents for students and
75 cents for non-students.

BENEFIT CANCELLED

Plans for an extraperformance

of “Ceilingzero” December 7, for

which the Pittsburgh Panhellenic,

association had contracted all
tickets, have been cancelled, Davis
announced Monday, due to a ruling

by the University trustees which;

forbids benefit performances in the
Foster Memorial.

The Panhellenic association had
intended to devote proceeds from
the sale of tickets for the special
performance to their scholarship

fund. Due to a misunderstanding;

within the University administra-
tion, plans for the extra perform-
ance were begun in ignorance o:?;'
the trustees’ ruling.

The University has refused ap-
plications for more than 60 beneﬁt
performances to date due to this
ruling, according to Theodore VV.
Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men.

AIRLINES DRAMA

A modern drama of the airways,
“Ceiling Zero” will take Univer-
sity theate_r—goers behind the
scenes of 2 transcontinental
lines, company to witness the tense
and romantic moments in the daily
life of the operators and pilots of
the airline.

Action in the play centers around
three old ﬂying buddies: Texas
Clark, Dizzy Davis, and Jake Lee,
the latter of whom is the superin-
tendent ot the airlines. These
roles are held by Austin Hay, C38;
Earl Riley, C39; and John Vv’ith'um,
BA38, respectively.

Juvenile leads in the play are
Peggy Magee. C40; and August E.

Gives Special
Aptitude Test

Pre-Med Students
Take Entrance Exam
Early Next Month

Medical aptitude tests will
be given to all pre-medical stu-
dents who intend to apply for
adinission to the School of
ll-Iedici.11e next year, according
to Dr. Omar C. Held, assistant
to the dean of the College.

The test will be given Fri-
day, December 3, at 3:30 o’clock
-in 24 Cathedral, and will be ad-
ministered only to those who pre-
sent a receipt from the treasurer’s
oﬁice showing that the exa1nina-
tion fee of one dollar has been
paid.

RESULTS SIGNIFICANT»,

‘Results of the test, which has
been conducted for the last seven
years by the association of Amer-
ican Medical Colleges, have rather
closely indicated the type of work
which the students taking the test
later did in the medical school.

For this reason the tests have
an important bearing on the con-
sideration of the applicant’s ad-
mission to the School of Medicine.

It is not necessary that all pre-
medical requirements be completed
at the time the test is given if the
requirements will be fulﬁlled in
time for admission to the school in
the fall of 1938.

LATE EXAMIFEE

In exceptional circumstances
where the student will be unable
to take the test at the regular
time, arrangements may be made
to t.ake it at a later date. The
charge for the late examination,
however, will be five dollars. The
student must report to one of ten
special centers to take it.

Students who took the test last
year but were not admitted to the
School of Medicine should take a
re-examination at this time.

Inquiry Speaker
Urges Education
Against Diseases

Solution of the problem of
syphilis in the United States
today depcndsnpon ﬁnding and
treating all cases of the disease,
declared Dr. I. Hope Alexan-
der, city director of public
health, in his address Monday
at Inquiry Forum.

“I-Ve are equipped to treat
all cases of syphilis which we
find,” Dr. Alexander said. “The
whole problem resolves itself into
finding and treating cases, and
since treatment is relatively easy,
we are facedchiefly-:with the ques-
tion of ﬁnding all persons who
have syphilis.”

PUBLIC , EDUCATION

Prevention of the further spread
of venereal diseases can be accom-
plished through education of the
public to the means of controlling
them and through immediate treat-
ment of all cases, Dr. Alexander
explained.

To discover the exact extent of
the venereal disease problem, every
person in the United States would.
have to take a Wassermann test,
he stated. The only instance in
the country where this has been
accomplished on a large scale has
been there at the University, said
Dr. Alexander.

Citing the recent campaign of’

The Pitt News and the student
health services for free Wasser-
mann tests as a great step for-
ward, Dr. Alexander declared,
“You have started a work here"
which is far more valuable than

(Continued From Page 1)
ﬁne, upright gentleman, two of
whom I had the privilege of
teaching here at Law School.
Their defeat was largely a matter
of political circumstance.”

Mr. Thompson pointed out what
he believed to be the decisive fac-
tor in making possible his victory.
“The support given me by Judge;
Musmanno, I believe, was the de— !
termining force in my victory.”

Quiet, unassuming, and certain-
ly n-ot a politician, Dean Thomp-
son believes that he will not re-
tain his position as dean while he
acts as judge. “I could not de-
vote sufficient time to perform?

“But I will continue my as-
sociation with the University in
some other capacity.”

YVVCA Moves ;
(Continued From Page 1) 
were to direct the Y’s program and i
to supervise the work of the stu-
dent officers. Since then there
have been several such national
leaders located on campus. Mrs.
Emmett Barr, who replaced Miss
Helen Battrick this September, is
the seventh executive secretary.
Today the YWCA has broadened
its program so that it is no longer
a,str.ict.1y religious group. It spon-
sors the Hearth Ceremony, super-
vises social settlement work, holds
Inquiry Forums, and through
study groups and personal confer-
ences aims to help all students‘
work out an intelligent faith.
At present, Janet Crosby, C38,.
is student. president of the YWCA. [

Stetter Pulls Trees
Pool Publicity Stunt

Slightly over-impressed by
the publicity given him in last
Friday's news, William Stetter,
BA41, WPDU operator, sought
to attract attention by push-
ing Sidney Blum, BA41, into
the Trees pool, fifth hour, Mon- ,
day.

But Blum went straight
down, which was something
Stetter never expected. After
the rescue was made by Rus-
sell Lindberg, swimming in-
structor, Blum said:

“I saw my whole life race
past my eyes. Why did I try
to cheat on my girl last Sat-
vurday, night?”

Stetter refused to comment,

you realize. It is going to help me
to carry on this work in the Pitts-
burgh campaign against syphilis.”
SCANDANAVIA LEADS

In Scandinavian countries, much
the same type of anti—syphilis cam-
paign is being successfully carried
on as is being started in America,
he pointed out. Each case of the
disease must be properly treat.e‘d,i
and at the same time traced back
to the source of the infection.

“We must provide facilities for
treatment. Then we must ﬁnd
and treat syphilitics, voluntarily
it possible, but using the police
power of the health department if
necessary. I do not believe in
using the police power of the de-
partment it' it can be avoided, but‘
in many cases we must and do
compel treatment,” continued Dr.
‘Alexander. ’

ECONOMIC PROBLEM

“Syphilis is not only an import-»
ant medical problem, but also an
economic and social problem.
There is no great difficulty about
diagnosis or treatment. of the dis-
ease. Yet half a million people are
crippled by syphilis each year, and
very little has been done about it
other than the part carried out by
the medical profession,” he stated.

For treatment of venereal dis-
eases in Pittsburgh, Dr. Alexander
declared his vdet;erminati.on either
to have the work carried out by
hospitals or to establish a clinic
run by the health department for
that purpose.
