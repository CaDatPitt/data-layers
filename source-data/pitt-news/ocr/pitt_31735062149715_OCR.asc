ing from the." National Scholastic

view and criticism of yearbooks.

ter books by suggesting changes in
the next..year’s layout, material or
features.

' In classifying the yearbooks, the
association issues a pamphlet en-
titled “The Yearbook Scorebook”
by FrediL. Kildow. The pamphlet
contains the official grading by sec-
tions on the divisions of the book.

Favorable comments were es-
pecially noted on treatment of the

and light ‘iniormality of the fea-
tures.

The 1941 Owl senior salesmen
will meet on Monday for luncheon
at the expense of the Owl in Heinz
h.ouse at 12:45 o’clock, according
to Selwyn Loeb, BA4l, business
manager. ‘

‘ Senior salesmen should check
with the last two issues of the News
to make sure their names are listed
on the 1941 Owl selling list, Loeb
adds.

Seniors should arrange to have

their pictures taken by November

Tag lirwe

“Tag—days” appear headed here
again as a flood of traffic tags pres-
ziges hard days for Fifth avenue
parkers who have heretofore been
violating the two-hour parking or-
dinance on streets around the Ca-
thedral.

Although there has been a decid-
ed increase in the number of tags
given unwary parkers, the tags are
only “the normal enforcement of
regulations and not any new cam-
paign against student parkers,” In-
spector Dye of the Pittsburgh police
department reported when queried
on the situation.

The present attempt at enforce-
ment of an ordinance which per-
mits parking on Fifth avenue and
other streets around the Cathedral
for only two hours at a time is but a
hangover of last year’s “parking
squabble” when the police depart-
ment began enforcing an ordinance
which had been neglected for years.

Nothing has been done to rem-
edy the situation since last semester
and it appears that about the only
course open to students is to leave
their cars at home.

Dr. Lomas Outlines Possibilities

Of 1940 Campaign Propaganda

“Political speeches and mud-
slinging are useful today because
underneath them, a citizen, with
careful study, can ﬁnd the underly-
ing issues of the campaign.”

,Thus keynoting his talk, Dr.
Charles W. Lomas, instructor in
public speaking and director of
Men’s Debating association, opened
the ﬁrst of this year’s “Pitt Town
Meetings,” Monday with his talk
on “How to Listen to a Political
Speech in 1940.”

“National political speakers of to-
day have a difficult time with their
addresses because they must be gen-
eral enoughnot to offend an audi-
ence including Rotary club mem-
bers, steel puddlers, and a variety
of other citizens.

“It is by recognizing the patterns
of these speeches that we -can ﬁnd
what to listen to in these speeches
and what is just ‘talk.’ ”

“Many speeches today avoid issues
entirely and deal with personali-
ties. These speeches we must be
wary of so that we are not misled
by trivial issues,” Dr. Lomas.

“These speeches are negative in
nature, while others, positive in
character, deal with generalities
such as Mr. Willkie’s ‘I know how
to ‘get ._ jobs,’ and Mr. Roosevelt’s

non-political tours.

“We have too many hate-speech-
es with their talk of ﬁfth column,
communist, Nazi, and radical activ-
ities,” he brought out. “We are al-
so swamped with general meaning-
less speeches on patriotism, home,
security,‘ and the like.”

The Sophs Have Words for I t

The grotesque, the ghastly, the
glamorous, the gaudy in campus
BM and BWOC’s will be public
property at the Pitt Premier (alias
Soph Hop).

Anyway, that’s the idea behind
a publicity scheme of the Pitt
Premier committee that is solic-
iting writeups of campus student
luminaries and their resemblance to
movie big-wigs.

Their plans call for submission of
the word portraits to the dance com-
mittee and the later public an-
nouncement at the dance, next Fri-
day night.

Jack Hoeveler, L43, will be mas-
ter of ceremonies at the affair, do-
ing the descriptions a la Hollywood
as he presents each celebrity.

Here, boys and girls is your
chance to let everybody know your
opinion of M. and Mlle. Bigewige.

‘In one easy lesson, this is all you
have to do. Write twenty-ﬁve or

‘It may be ﬂattering, funny, or

National ‘Campaigns’ on Campus

Dems . . .

David Boies, BA42, was elected
chairman of the Pitt Roosevelt Col-
lege club at the organization meet-
ing held last Tuesday.

The Pitt club will be affiliated
with the Roosevelt College Clubs of
America, headed by Franklin D.
Roosevelt Jr., Boies said.

Major points discussed at the
meeting were absentee voting, or-
ganization of a speaker’s bureau,
and work to be done by individual
students in their home precincts.

Boies revealed that the Pitt
Roosevelt club “will not seek to ac-
quire ofﬁcial headquarters on Uni-
versity, property because, inas-
much as the University is a public
institution, it should not take sides
in a political campaign.”

Announcement of the formation
of a Willkie-for-President club on
campus was made early this week
by Fred S. Roth, Ed41, temporary
chairman of the organization.

Drafting “plans for a hot cam-
paign,” Roth claims a “nucleus of
200»members,” for the Pitt Willkie
club. Executive committeeinen in-
clude so far: Joe Roberts, BA41;
Al Holbrook, E41; Al McArdle, C42;
Bob Pitcairn, C42; Jack Watson,
E42; Dave Zacharias, C42; and John
Burnham, Ed4l.

Ben Foote, C42, has been named
publicity director of the unit and
states that all students, regardless
of political affiliation, are eligible
and are invited to join.

The Game
_ By Bill McElwain

Somewhat bloody but deﬁnitely
unbowed after last week’s bruising
stalemate with Southern Methodist,
Golden Panther football
forces oppose the powerful Fordham
Ram tomorrow afternoon at the
Stadium, and for the third time in
four weeks the Pittsburghers are

well on the short end of the betting
odds.

Fordham, pre-season choice to
rank with Cornell and Boston Col-
lege as the East’s best, is undefeat-
ed, while the Panthers are just
breaking even. But the records do
not bear close scrutiny. Pitt was
deﬁnitely not the team it seemed
to be against Ohio State, and against
both Missouri and S.MU (one win,
one tie) the Panthers were a clearly
superior eleven. ’

On the other hand, the Rams
took over West Virginia, 20-7, with
an exhibition that left both Bill
Kern and his proteges far from im-
pressed, then downed Tulane by the
same score. This would seem. a
better d-omonstration of Ram potent-
ness, except that in two games
prior to the FOl‘Cll’1F.‘.ll'l clash, par for
the course against Tulane was four
touchdowns.

Both teams have something in
common, a sharp difference in the
strength of ﬁrst and second teams.
So far the Rams have needed to call
out the reserves infrequently, but
the Panther problem is something
else again.

Luckily, when Charley Bowser
1215 had to call on individual mem-
bers of the supporting cast, they
have responded better than might
have been expected. Most notable
example of this has been Jack

Tine Alumni Hold
A Top Day

TONIGHT THE GENERAL Alumni As-
sociation sets another precedent in its 124-
year history. It will honor eleven of the Uni-
versity’s outstanding graduates as “men who
have, through their initiative and personal suc-
cess, brought recognition to this, their Alma
Mater.”

We are glad that an agency of the University
is ﬁnally taking this progressive step.

5} We have long felt that the University has ap-
parently limited the distribution of honors to un-
dergraduates alone, for achievements in schol-
arship and leadership in campus activities.

The men chosen’, for this ﬁrst “All-American‘

Achievement Team-” have made many contri-
butions in their various ﬁelds since their grad-
uation from the University. ‘ -

The very factthat Pitt honors them at this

 .does not,  that, the school. is taking’, A.

 for the success they have, made. We do

lil§e,_,to feel, howe.)/_er,.that the training and_ ed-

ucational back_ground.re_ceiv_ed here was an im-
portant factor in the development of these men
into the important ﬁgures they are today. A

"The occasionfor the announcement of the
“All-American"’7"-is the homecoming week-end
sponsored by the ‘alumni association. To stu-
dents, this doesn’t mean much, other than the
fact that they have been invited to a smoker
and some parties and that fraternities are hold-
ing open house tomorrow.

But to the menand women of today who were
the Pitt students of yesterday‘, the festivities be-
ginning tonight and extending through tomor-
row‘ make up the big Pitt event of the year, an
excuse to drive out to Oakland to see how the
old place is and what the oldgang is doing.

H To these men and women, the Peter and Polly
Pitt of yesteryear, the News extends a hearty
welcome home and best wishes for a swell week-
end. _ . .

\Vhom Both What  
Music Charm?

"OUR SPORTS EDITOR had a little item on
his page the other day concerning the bands at
last" week's game. He said “the Mustang band
was way ahead of the Pitt band in the crowd’s
esteem.” . . V

‘Risking the danger of spreading staff dis-
sension and the possibility of inﬂating the ego of
Pit-t band members, quiet, modest, and reserved
as they are, we take issuewith this statement.

V‘ After hearing for days prior to the game that
the SMU band and the SMU football team were
going to play in the Stadium, we looked forward
to something extra-special.

'. We heard and saw the performance.

' The conclusion we reached was that the Texas
swingsters would have been a riot at a dance
or at a jive session, but as far as a football game
was concerned, the dignity, musical precision,
and the martial color contributed by our boys
and girl in blue took top honors.

That’s what we thought last Saturday after-
noon. We are wondering what percentage of the
crowd we represented.

3 lleports 011 ‘II’ Day Gossip

By Lew Riley

Washington, Oct. 18.——-(IWP)——It just goes to show
you what the news-reel will do to you.

We always supposed that a lot of high-ranking
army men in some “smoke—ﬁlled room” would be
cooking up plans about now for the dramatic selection
of draft numbers late this month —— ﬁguring how the
president should be blindfolded and should draw the
first number from the 1917 ﬁshbowl with a battery of
photographers and news-reel men recording the event
for posterity. '

But it develops that the army generals don’t have
much to say about it.

At one of the daily press conferences in the national
selective service headquarters here this week some-
body wanted to know how and when the numbers would
be drawn. The answer came back very simply:

__ “The drawing? Any way you boys want it; all we
want to do is help you}? A 4 A
 .And the “boys” are really determined to make a
great show out of it. Plenty of side bets will be in
the ofﬁng. Some of" the- enterprising reporters promise
to have private bingo games rolling and to pay off in
dishes and silverware ‘as. the numbers are called. One
bright gentleman ofthe press suggested that the draw-
in'g’_be held in a downtown theatre with spotlights and
drama and paid admissions . _ . of course, to go to
some humane cause like beer on tap in all the Wash-
ihgton press rooms. -

. Although it was originally expected that the lottery
would be held as early as ﬁve days after registration,
ten days at least will be necessary to allow all outlying
areas to report their registration totals. They say the
only means of communication in some parts of Texas
is ‘to strap the information on a mule and head him in
the right direction . . ﬁve, ten, perhaps ﬁfty miles.

The Style Show’s Behashed,

‘More Phi Belt Names Added
By Roy Ruane and Betty Schoeller

Dear Diary:

Things were exceedingly happy and cheerful down
amidst the smoke today considering the recent rush
week and yesterday’s exhaustive “style show.” Many
a cheerleader would have been amazed if he could
have heard the spirited singing of some twenty Tuck
Shoppers. Such volume would have rocked the Sta-
dium any Saturday afternoon. I actually felt a tug
at my heart strings (?) when they wound up with
“Alma Mater” and every lazy soul in the place stood
up on his own two feet and sang. P. S.—The ten0l‘S
"were terrible. .

The only sad faces in the Tuck Shop belonged to
Rae Young and Lew Cox who had been celebrating
the fashion show and Lew’s impending ‘birthday for
two days. ’

I acquired someone’s stray scratch paper yesterday
and scrawled across the top were these very words:
Quote: Who is the Homering pidgeon that has been

who drives Margy to school, but her heart has ﬂown

Common Sense

University Freedom
Penned in a I etter

by Gerald Ziskind a

My dear Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler:

I read that you have declared your determination
to oust any Columbia university professor who dis-
agrees with your point of View on foreign policy. You
say that you will not have your university embar-
rassed by faculty members unwilling to support the
government’s strong program against the dictators.

Your words, Doctor, take on redoubled signiﬁcance
since, I understand, after a similar pronouncement
twenty-three years ago, you ﬁred numerous prominent
professors for opposition to World War I. In short,
you have become the selfappointed censor of Columbia
university, and as concerns foreign policy, you have
ﬁtted a straight-jacket for your faculty.

Now I want you to understand, Doctor, that I am
much in agreement with your foreign policy. I agree
when you say that the present conﬂict lies “between
beasts and human beings.” I heartily endorse your
vigorous efforts to send material aid to Britain; to
promote public awareness of the challenge to our way
of life latent in Nazi methods and doctrines. Your
work in behalf of struggling peoples, for the preserva-
tion of abstract freedom, has become world-renowned.
The medals you possess, the multitudinous honors be-
stowed upon you, the treaties and agreements estab-
lished through your intercession—all testify to your
worthiness and rank as a public spirited citizen.

But Let Us Not Stampede

patriotic citizens who may differ with our view. I
particularly refer to educators. The class rooms of
universities must be open for free, untrammelled dis-
cussion of all questions. Because foreign policy is of
crucial importance today, its conﬂicting proponents
should receive fair and unrestricted hearing. This
country and its universities must continue as reposi-
tories of the liberal tradition, free for honest differ-
ences and discussion.

The Great Tragedy,

Doctor, is the fact that Nazi agents, crafty and un-
scrupulous as they are, go about unhindered; while
the innocent, objective educator is apprehended as the
ﬁend and criminal. Such an incident has occurred here
in Pittsburgh, where a patriotic high school teacher,
far more worthy and community-minded than most
public school teachers, become the object of criminal
investigation because he made the mistake of pre-
siding at an indiscreet meeting of “war objectors.”
Even after he admitted his error, the bloodhounds kept
after him demanding that their thirst for “red” blood

Let Us Work Together,

Doctor, in promoting the educator’s perspective, the
honest professor must be free to discuss all issues
relative to foreign policy. The Nazi agent, within or
without the university, must be tracked down and de-

should so perform it, even more worthily will be en-
shrined the name of Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler.

Willlcie Club

Wants Members
Editor, the Pitt News:

This letter is an open invitation
to all students irrespective of party
afﬁliation to join the Willkie “Cru-
sade.” We have organized a Pitt
chapter of the Willkie for President
Club on campus and have drafted
plans for a hot campaign_. At pres-
‘ent the club has a nucleus of 200
members, a membership which we
hope to expand to many times that
number. If you are interested in
doing active campaign work on
campus, contact one of the follow-
ing committee-msenz‘ Joe Roberts,
Dave Zacharias, Al Holbrook, Jack
Watson, John Burnham, Al Mc-
Ardle, Fredr Roth, Bob Pitcairn,
and Ben 'Foote.

Roosevelt Club  A

Discussed
Editor, the Pitt News:

Truly Pitt has never witnessed
such spontaneous support as the
campus Roosevelt Club is enjoying.
Every patriotic liberal, practical-
minded far sighted, idealistic, un-
selﬁsh, enthusiastic student has en-
rolled in its ranks. Its leaders are
astonished at the overwhelming re-
sponse to their modest pleas for
members. The results are all the
more remarkable when one consid-
ers that no high pressure soliciting,
no promises, no appeals to personal
gain were made in recruiting mem-
bers.

The Roosevelt Club is the epi-
tome of modern youth in action.
Recognizing the peerless qualities
of their leader, his unimpeachable
record, and his indispensability it
logically follows that legions of
college students would rush to his
support at this time. Once the No-
vember objective a accomplished,
the last assault on “horse and bug-
gy” traditions will be but a glorious
memory. In the Roosevelt youth
movement students recognize the
opportunity to achieve a‘ quick
Utopia through unswerving loyalty
to the perpetual executive. A

Oh, yeah?

New Deal

Restores Faith
Editor, the Pitt News:

Few political contests in our his-
tory have been as one sided as the
present one, and justly 50. During
the past seven years of the New
Deal more has been done to restore
the faith of the people in themselves
and to elevate the dignity of the

common man than during any com-- A

parable period of recent years. The
New Deal .-has governed not in the
partisan interests of any group but
in the interest of the nation as a
whole.

Now unfortunately, our energies
must be divided. Out of Western
Europe there_has arisen as black a
tyranny as ever threatened the
freedom of civilized man. To meet
it boldly requires courageous lead-
ership and -Franklin D..' Roosevelt
has proven himself a truly indom-
itable ﬁghter. , ~ '

-But leadership alone is not
enough. The people of the United
States must have reason to feel
their way to life, their govern-
ment," intrinsically superior to-'-the
new despotis-m. They must have a
faith for living. Their morals can-
not be sustained by a man who has
hired labor spies to crush industrial
unionism; by a man who once de-
nounced the Social Security Act.

It can as little be nourished by
a party that has been hallowed in
bondage by large industrialists for
generations. Only the New Deal
can give the common man a faith
for living. The record speaks for
itself. Will the Future dare forget
the Past?

Battle-Scarred
Panther Faces
ordhurn Rum

Continued front. page one
Goodridge, senior right end, who
went in for Joe Rettinger in the
.ﬁrst period against SMU and nearly
chased the Mustangs out of Oak-
land.  '

Since X-ray pictures have dis-
«closed that Rettinger’s leg. is frac-
tured, Joe will not only have to re-
main in St. Francis hospital _for
some time but will play no more
this season. Thus Goodridge will
probably hold down a starting job
‘the rest of the year. _With Jack
moving up, senior Earl Pressel,
Goodridge’s brother Phi Gam, gets
an automatic promotion to second
string. ‘

Panther Worries

The situation at the other end of
the line is rather doubtful, also. Al-
though the injury is not serious,
junior Stan Gervelis came out of
the SMU battle with a battered
ankle and there is a possibility that
he may not start. If Gervelis opens
the game on the bench, Al Gurczen-
ski, another senior, will take over
in his stead. Johnny Stahl would
then advance to second team.

.Still a third casualty is John
Gates, second team left guard.
Gates’ banged-up leg leaves him
off the active list with George
Mitchell running in the vacated
guard position.
ﬁlo Ram Casualties
;_: The Rams, apparently, have no
sick list worries and will start a
full contingent of regulars, many
of whom are well known to Pitts-
burgh football enthusiasts. Not the
.least of these is left end Vince Den-
nery, who stepped off 99 yards with
a._ recovered fumble to sink the
Panthers at the Polo Grounds last
year. Up to then, the Panthers
were on their way, but Dennery’s
run put the Bowserites back on
their heels and provided the big
push in the Rams’ 27-13 victory.
Eshmont Rides Again
7 Master Vincent’s dash. thus, was
almost directly responsible for eve-
ning the Pitt-Fordham series. After
three scoreless years, the Panthers
smashed the Rams 24-13 in 1938,
but last year’s game put the two
clubs back on equal terms again.

Another Ram Pittsburghers know

well is Lennie Eshmont, the left
halfback who as a sophomore in
1938 almost overcame the best ef-
forts of Pitt’s “dream backﬁeld.”
Jimmy Blumenstock, who fired a
60-yard touchdown pass as Esh-
mont’s sub last year, has shifted
to right half and the shift has hin-
dered him not a bit.

The other two boys in the Ford-
ham backﬁeld are Jim Noble and
Steve Felipowicz, he of the typical
Rose Hill monicker. .Noble played
considerable quarterback last year,
while sophomore Steve has looked
great in his two tests so far.
Lansing Fine End

Ray Riddick has been replaced
at right end by sophomore Jim Lan-
sing, a ﬁne pass receiver and a man
the Panthers must watch. The
tackles are John Kuzman, a hulk-
ing giant who was outstanding as a
sophomore but was disappointing
last year, and Joe Ungerer, who
played a whale of a game against
the Pitts last year.

At center is captain Lou DeFilli-—
po, whom some say is better than
the famous “Wojy,” while juniors
Larry Sartori and Tom Bennett
ﬂank him at the guards.

The Pitt N eyvs

Carlson Banks
O11 Holdovers

For Big Year

While Doc Carlson drills his boys
in the Pitt theories of basketball
and health, furnishing one pint of
ice cream for every two hours of
practice, the veteran coach is count-
ing heavily on the returning mem-
bers of last year’s squad" to lead the
team to a successful season.

Of the 22 boys drilling every day
on the stadium court, ﬁve are ‘sen-
iors, three juniors, and 14 sopho-
mores. Eddie Straloski, A sharp-
shooting little forward-.,_.who_se play
has sparked Pitt‘ teams. for the past
two years, is a key man in this out-
ﬁt. With Jimmie Klein, George
Kocheran, Sam Milanovich, and
Mel _Port, Straloski has battled on
the hardwood for his school through
two years of tough varsity compe-
tition, and brings to this year’s
squad the polished brilliance of a
potential all-American. '

Jimmie “Doll” Klein is a hard-
ﬁghting ball-hawk Whose store of
basketball potentialities has too
often in the past been hidden by his
erratic behavior on the court. With
the rough edges of his play worn
off by experience, Klein should be a
tough man to keep out of a varsity
berth this fall.

Mel Port, red-header center
whose consistently good work was
a bright spot in the midst of a dis-
mal 1939 losing streak,_ returns to
action eager to make this year
count. Long, lanky Sam Milano-
vich, pride of Aliquippa, carries on
the tradition of a’ basketball. play-
ing family, the last of whom starred
for Geneva last year. .

George “Koch” Kocheran, smooth-
working play-maker from Du-
quesne, expects to keep his hard-
earned forward spot in the face of
stiff competition from junior Larry
Paﬁrath -and a host of ambitious
sophomores. r

Mitterling Plans

Strenuous Drills

Fall practice continues to hold
the baseball spotlight as coach
Ralph Mitterling sends his boys
through paces that include every-
thing from beating out bunts to
chasing deep... outﬁeld flies.

Mitterling’s mound staff of Bob
Banks, Joe Wilk, Jack Chiurrazzi,
and Andy Mack each take turns in
tossing the ball to the batter. Wilk,
a newcomer to this years staff,
formerly pitched for the New Cas-
tle tcam that recently won the city
and county baseball championships.

Al Bush, Frank Goeltz, Al Hol-
brook, Guy Guadagnino, and Art
Bariska are all veterans who are
returning for another year of serv-
ice with the Mitterlingmen.

Lynch Says Any Dope Can Forecast

AndSoHeKeepsHis]ob . . .

By Phil Lynch

Football prognostication may
some day be listed among the deeds
of daring, comparable to Caesar’s
wetting his tootsies in the Rubicon,
or Steve Brodie’s high ﬂip from a
Brooklyn bridge diving board.

The only difference, perhaps, is
‘that the aforementioned notables
indulged in sissy stuff. Didn’t the
mighty Gaius need a sage, or divin-
-ator, to direct his activities. Divi-
nation is a pleasant subject and all
you need to study it is a butcher’s
knife and a liver.

Now football prediction is a horse
of another color. That’s he-manish,
masculine to the umpth degree. It
requires the application of a virile
wit, calloused, and without any
feeling. In all fairness, it requires
shrewd knowledge to hazard a
guess.

Oh heck, what’s the use! You're
right. Prognostication is a lost art
and its principles are entirely sub-
jective. There’s no argument for
it. Any dope can forecast!

Pitt 14, Fordham 6

The Panthers have caused con-
siderable trouble for their opposi-
tion to date, and Sleepy Jimmy
Crowley will soon get over his
drowsiness. The Rams boast ﬁne
backs in Eshmont and Blumenstock,
but their line is as soft as a mat-
tress. Pitt’s attack from the ground
and air will avenge their defeat of
last year.

UCLA 9, California 6

This coast battle is closer than
many expect. The Bruins of UCLA
have been beaten twice, once by
Southern Methodist, and once by
the Texas Aggies. Both skirmishes
were tight. The Golden Bears from
Berkeley would do or die for genial
Stub Allison but as yet their of-
fense has bogged in crucial spots.

Notre Dame 13, Carnegie Tech 0

The ﬁghting Irish have their
greatest team in years. In fact,
thoughful Elmer of the Irish held
back his offense to save Georgia
Tech from becoming “a rambling
wreck.” Saggau and Piepul are
what football coaches dream of,
and seldom get.

Cornell 21, Syracuse 0

The Big Red is deﬁnitely on the
march and about the only things
that could stop Carl Snavely’s boys
are a couple of Mack trucks going
at high speed. This is a rivalry
from long back and Ossie Solem has
his lads at high pitch, but even. that
won’t be tough.

Duke 7, Cotgate 0

The Blue Devils are still sore
over their defeat by Tennessee and
their wrath will be hurled right at
razzle dazzle Colgate. Wallace
Wade has a hard charging line that
should smash Andy Kerr's ﬂashy
offense back on its heels.

Duquesne 21, Mississippi 13

The Dukes had the scare of their
young lives last week when a game
South Carolina team stole the play
and the ball for a half. But the
Hilltoppers can’t scare easily. Don-
elli’s outﬁt is as good as any team
in the country right now.

Michigan 21, Illinois 7 "

Tommy l-larmon likes three touch-
downs a game and what he likes
is okay with Michigan. Old Zupp
has a ﬁghting team but what’s the
use of ﬁghting when ghostlike Har-
mon is haunting you.

Ohio State 20, Minnesota 0

The Buckeyes will pull no punch-
es to win this one and convince their
critics that they have a top ﬂight
combination. Mr. Scott may work

racuse.

This is ‘the third in the series,
Sports Man of the Week. Each
week throughout the year the man
who has contributed most to Uni-
versity athletics during the past
week will be honored. This week’s
selection is:

JACK GOODRIDGE—He was a
l0ng_.time on the way but he cer-
tainly seems to have arrived. Good-
ridge got his. ﬁrst big break in the
Tech game his sophomore year and
was the best end on the ﬁeld, but
with the exception of last year’s
Tech battle, he then remained in
the background until last Saturday.

When. Joe Rettinger went out
with a broken leg early in the ﬁrst
period, Jack trotted out on the ﬁeld
and was nothing less than terriﬁc
from then on. He... blocked well, he
rushed Mustang passers all over the
place, and he smeared SMU ball
carriers almost every..time they
tried to turn his end. Knocked out
on one play, he got back on his
feet and made the next six tackles.

‘The Woineli’
And Football

By Harriet Harris

It seems to me that every coed
attending Pitt is an ardent football
There are, however, prota-
bly no men students who agree
with me. They are of the opinion
that it is Kracum, not football, who
packs the stadium with Pitt’s best
mar~icured students each Saturday
afternoon.

Maybe the menare right. After
listening in on some of the feminine
“football clinics” I learned from
several freshmen cuties that they
know nothing about the game ex-
cept that the fellows who play it
have to be big and strong——some-
times they are cute, too. They also
seem to think that the game would
be a great deal more interesting if
the umpires would stop “haggling”
over every little point. '

Everything considered, the South-
ern Methodist-Pitt football clash
was a very colorful event. The
red and blue uniforms of the SMU
team weaving among the gold and
blue of the Pitt team was a beauti-
ful sight to see. Even the umpires,
when they were in condition to
move over the ﬁeld, added to the
general picture.

Druids Bewail Loss
Of Initiation Ritual

Druids have broken into the
news again, but this time it isn’t
because of a new inspiration in
the form of a new constitution.

The worried looks on the faces
of the Druids are caused by the
loss of the most sacred Druid
item, the initiation ritual. The
ritual, which is being hunted high
and low throughout the office of
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men and a Brother Druid, was
last seen when Lew Riley, last
year’s Druid president, oﬂiciated
at the spring initiation.

Political Dance

Th’ CO e °    
1s Ev nlng

In keeping with the current rage
for things political, the pre-medical
students will give a dance resemb-
ling a “big political rally” tonight
in Heinz house from 8 to 12 o'clock,
announces Charles Vates, 43, chair-
man. "
 .Oﬁ‘icial regalia will include skirts
and sweaters and the price of a
ticket, 35 cents per couple. Music
will be provided by recordings.

One of the requirements of the

dance, which is exclusively for pre-
meds, is that everyone wear a po-
litical button (any party’s). A 10-
cent tax will be levied on non-
wearers of buttons; and stags will
be thrown out regardless of politic-
al afﬁliation.
~A ballot contest will be staged
on the question: how many more_
votes than his rival will the presi-
dential winner receive in the No-
vember election?
his prize ‘will be secret until after
the election.

Cathedral early next week.

In the Pitt Premier booth on the
ground floor of the Cathedral stu-
dents will see a series of cartoons,
two today, two on Monday, and
two on Wednesday. These cartoons
suggest a popular song title, and
any student who guesses the titles
ﬁrst will receive a complimentary
ticket to the Pitt Premier, says Ike
Icardi, C43, publicity manager for
the dance.

This contest will be in a series,
and there should be three winners
for each of the three days. Stu-
dents who think they have the cor-
rect answer should drop their an-
swe-rs in the ballot box in 828 Ca-
thedral. The answers will be ac-
cepted nowhere else.

Will Bradley will furnish the

War, Classical Weekly Keep Going

By Alice Lewis

Despite the steady decrease in
the number of books on the classics
imported from Europe since the
war, Classical Weekly, review of
books in the ﬁeld of classics pub-
lished at the University, will go to
press as usual, promises Dr. James
Stinchcomb, professor of classics
and editor of the Weekly.

“We won’t be reviewing books
quite as promptly,” he said, “but
they will be printed eventually.”
This can be made possible, he ex-
plained, by drawing on an over-
supply of books, saved. from the
time when they were so plentiful
that only the best were. kept and
the rest destroyed. Referring to his
“horde” he revealed, that_ he had
saved over 200 for :‘_‘just such a
rainy day.”

and head of the _ department of
mathematics, will represent his
alma mater, the University of Cali-

_ fornia, at the inauguration tomor-
row of Dr. Felix Morley as presi-
dent of Haverford college, Haver-
ford, Pa. 4 p

In commenting on the event, Dr.
Taylor declared: “President Mor-
ley has achieved distinction in so
many ﬁelds. that it is sometimes
overlooked that he is also eminent
as a mathematician.” _

Dr. Taylor has been a friend of
President Morley since they met
at the University of California
twenty years ago when President
Morley was beginning his mathe-
matical investigation.

At State College, Pa., Dr. Alfred
P. James, professor of history, and
Dr. Russell J. Ferguson, associate
professor of history, are attending
the ninth annual meeting of the
Pennsylvania Historical association
in session today and tomorrow. Dr.
James is a member of the council
of the association.

Dr. R. E. Sherrill, professor and
head of the oil and gas department,
delivered a paper last Monday be-
fore the annual conference of the
Eastern Petroleum Credit group in
the Venetian room of the Webster
Hall hotel. His subject was: “Eco-
nomic Status of the Petroleum In-
dustry.”

books per day the department was
receiving a year ago, is the new six
per month average received in Au-
gust. Of the six, one came from
England, one from Hungary, two
from Sweden, one from Scotland,
and one from France. This is not
representative of England, however,
since a comparatively large number
is usually received from that coun-
try. The authorities probably de-
cided not to clutter up trains to
the coast with books, Dr. Stinch-
comb surmised.

The dearth of classical books is
most noticeable in Italy, for none
have been received from that coun-
try since May 10. Germany holds
the lowest rank at present. Dr.
Stinchcomb cited as an example of
the loweringof literary standards
a package received from Germany
last month. It contained one issue
for each of the three months of

J une, July and August of the Philo-
logische Wichenschrift, German
counterpart of the Weekly. Of the
four regular issues a month only
one was published. The issue for
June was full-size and printed on
a good quality of paper; July’s pub-
lication was printed on a very thin
low grade paper, while the issue for
August was one-third its regular
size, and printed on very inferior
paper. The quality of editing de-
creased proportionally. Only one
American book was listed.

“During the ﬁrst World War,”
Dr. Stinchcomb continued, “the
publications were regular and used
good paper stock.” This must indi-
cate a lack of paper at present, he
said. -‘ _

fDr. Stinchcomb stated that sub-
scriptions have dropped off at an
alarming rate-,. although as late as
