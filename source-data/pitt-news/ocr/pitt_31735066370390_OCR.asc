Researcher describes ape studies

By Douglas Bennett
Staff Writer

The rain forests of Borneo and Grand
Rapids, Mich. are, indeed, a world
apart. Yet the two came together Fri-
day in a unique event at the Twentieth
Century Club. Organized by the
Friends of the New Zoo, the gather-
ing was intended to raise money and
increase public awareness of the High-
land Park Zoo’s transformation.

In his formal introduction, the zoo’s
new director, Charles Wikenhauser,
who comes from a widely acclaimed
zoo in Grand Rapids, revealed am-
bitious plans for the future. He plans
to have the zoo accredited this year, at-
tract one million annual visitors by
1990 and acquire the gorillas which the
zoo currently is seeking. He noted.
however, that support must come from
both the city and individuals.

By -investing capital, Wikenhauser
feels the improved zoo will attract more

visitors, thus enhancing Pittsburgh’s
cultural reputation.

Dr. Birute Galdikas, the featured
speaker and one of the world’s fore-
most anthropologists, has spent the past
14 years doing ﬁeld research through-
out Borneo. Galdikas’ speech focused
on the many problems confronting the
great apes, orangutans in particular,
throughout the world. The destruction
of rain forests for farming and public
works is having an immediate impact
on the orangutan’s crucial food supply.

While the Indonesian government
has pledged to aid in the preservation
of these creatures, little has been done
to stop poachers. hunters and develop-
ers from encroaching on the orangu-
tan’s environment.

In the course of Galdikas‘ work. a
special relationship developed between

her small son, Binti, and the captive -

orangutans they kept. In an unrelated
experiment, these orangutans were
taught the rudiments of sign language.
As his only playmates, Binti began im-

itating the orangutans, picking up their
habits and communicating in sign.

Eventually, the boy’s behavior be-
came extremely ape-like, and Galdikas
and her husband decided he needed
human companions. All of this was
very interesting to Galdikas and may
pave the way for future research in this
area.

Galdikas also explained the problems
of trying to observe orangutans in the
wild.

“We used to spend hours following
noises and mating calls just to get a ﬁve
minute sighting.” She said. “And then
they were 100 feet above our head."

To combat this problem. they made
use of the natives and their extraor-
dinary tree—climbing ability. Armed
with a camera. the natives would climb
high, in anticipation of the shy
creatures.

They found, much to the interest of
Galdikas, that orangutans had unusual

BAS sponsors fair
to celebrate history  

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

In the William Pitt Union Ballroom
last Friday, a group of students
gathered around a Bible and vehement-
ly discussed theology with" local church
representatives, while others stood
before a small television and watched
Minister Louis Farrakhan preach. Two
small children looked at photographs
of black leaders and scrutinized the
bake sale at the next table.

In celebration of Black History
Month, the Black Action Society end-
ed February with an Afro—American
History Fair. The event was designed
to help black students become more
aware of their heritage and to spark
consciousness among all students.

“I think we raised some con-
sciousness today,” said BAS Political
Action Chairman Rashid Soundiata.
“It’s a reflection of our community,
something to keep us in touch so we
don’t get cut off from the community
and start to think were something
we’re not,” he said.

Several community groups were
represented at the fair with stands and
displays. The National Society of Black

Engineers presented a pictorial display
entitled “Blacks in Science." The
Pittsburgh Chapter of the Sickle Cell
Society offered free testing for sickle

I cell anemia, a condition which afﬂicts

one out of every 500 Black Americans.

Videos were presented throughout
the day by local theological groups.
The videos featured black religious
leaders Elijah Muhammad, Louis Far-
rakhan and Malcolm X. Religious
books, tapes and newspapers were sold
as well. «

Local bookstores sponsored displays
of books by and about black political
leaders such as Malcolm X, Nelson
Mandela and Winnie Mandela, and the
Sigma Gamma Rho sorority presented
a display featuring the history of blacks
in academia.

Dubois Milliones represented the
youth of the community with his essay
on black history. Dubois is the son of
Pitt Professor Jake Milliones.
Milliones’ essay was the winner in a
contest run by the BAS in Pittsburgh’s
middle schools.

Soundiata said he considered the
event well—attended. “We didn’t exact-
ly have a captive audience all day, but
a couple hundred people passed in and
out here today,” he said.

Pitt engineer honored

Donna G. Blackmond, assistant pro-
fessor of chemical engineering in Pitt’s
School of Engineering, has been
selected as a Presidential Young In-
vestigator by the National Science
Foundation.

Blackmond is one of only 100 young
scientists and engineers in the United
States so recognized by the NSF this
year. She will receive a minimum of
$25,000 annually for the next five years
from the NSF and is eligible to receive
up to $75,000 additionally per year
from industrial contributions and NSF
matching funds.

. Blackmond’s research in the Depart-
ment of Chemical and Petroleum
Engineering focuses on fundamental in-
vestigations of the surface chemistry of
small metal crystallites. Thisjyear she
will expand her efforts by the use of

solid state nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy

Blackmond received B.S. and M.S.
degrees in chemical engineering from
Pitt and a Ph.D. in chemical engineer-
ing from Carnegie—Mellon University.
While in graduate school she main-
tained a 4.0 grade point average. As
a student, she received a National Merit
Scholarship and was a National Science
Foundation Fellow. She joined the Pitt
faculty in September 1984.

The NSF created this awards pro-
gram to provide cooperative research
support for the nation’s most outstand-
ing and promising young science and
engineering faculty. The awards are in-
tended to improve the capability of
universities to respond to the demand
for highly qualified scientific and
engineering personnel for academic‘
and industrial research.

Is Polish freedom alive?

By Jack Burkman
Staff writer _

In a Thursday night address, former
U.S. National Security Advisor
Zbigniew Brzezinski contended that the
spirit of freedom remains alive in
Poland despite the apparently sve-
cessful suppression of the Solidarity
movement by the country’s Soviet-
controlled regime.

According to Brzezinski, the Polish
underground remains a headache for
the government.

“There continues to be groups which
are powerful, independent of the state,
such as the church,” he told a packed
house at the William Pitt Union. “The
church in particular has become the
protector and shelterer of what exists
in the aftermath of Solidarity.”

Results of underground efforts.
Brzezinski noted. were clearly observ-
able in the last general elections.
Because certain groups were able to
monitor turnout, the government was
compelled to admit that not all of those

Warnings Shuttled

The presidential commission appointed to in-
vestigate the disastrous mid-air explosion of the
space shuttle Challenger has uncovered disturb-
ing evidence of poor judgment and neglecton the
part of NASA officials. When NASA decided to
go ahead with the launch, it did so in spite of
warnings voiced by experts from two of its ma-
jor contractors — Morton Thiokol, Inc. and
Rockwell International.

The commission has discovered that several
Thiokol engineers expressed their concern that the
sub-freezing temperatures of that morning might
have weakened the O-rings (the function of which
is to seal in the hot gases generated in the shut-
tle’s booster rockets) and advised against the
launch. In retrospect, the wisdom of their cau-
tion is readily apparent; it is now believed that
the malfunction of the O—rings was responsible
for the fatal explosion of the Challenger. Ofﬁcials
of Rockwell International too uttered words of
caution against the launch, saying that icing had
made conditions unsafe.

NASA chose to disregard the advice of both
agencies and did not believe the problems to be
of great enough consequence to delay the launch.
In this case, it would appear that the safety of these
seven astronauts was taken much too lightly. In
the bureaucratic backlash of timetables and per-
formance quotas, NASA officials made a grave
error in judgement. The cataclysmiccatastrophe
of the space shuttle Challenger demonstrates the
urgent need for greater fastidiousness in the
decision—making process. NASA will surely learn
its lesson from this tragedy. It is, however, a
grievous misfortune that it required a lethal jolt
such as this for its instruction.

Social

Darwinian. El1t1st

In response to Mr. Bold’s audacious
remarks found in The Pitt News on
Feb. 24, I would like to make a few
comments. Mr. Bold is neither a stu-
dent of history, nor is he a student of
Darwinism. Also, Mr. Bold’s column
had elitist and sexist overtones which
cannot go unrefuted.

First of all, Darwin’s theory does not
assume that “survival of the fittest”
necessarily ‘means survival of the
“best.” Fitness within Darwin’s theory
is defined as reproductive success (i.e.
those in a species who contribute more
to the gene pool). Fitness does not
mean those within a species who are
the strongest or best, it means those
who have more surviving offspring.

Also, it is apparent that Mr. Bold
knows nothing of the nature of “social
darwinism." The term “social dar-
winism” was created in the 19th Cen-
tury and equated with the work of

Herbert Spencer, who was trying to
justify his political views about the
nature of women. Herbert said that
women were inherently unequal to men
and could never be equal. He said that
the subordination of women was not
only natural, but desirable. Social dar-
winists attempted to justify social ine-
quality, and they believed that social
inequalities between the sexes, or be-
tween the classes, or the races
represented the operation of natural
selection and therefore should not be
tampered with. The association is en-
tirely incorrect.

Mr. Bold, are you saying that a doc-
tor is more important than a janitor? Or
an executive is more important than a
secretary? Usually, those in such high
positions are there not because they are
more intelligent but because they had
more access to those types of positions.
What do you know about the redistribu-
tion of wealth? My parents pay so
many taxes that they can hardly afford
to send me to school. Your big guys
do all they can to remove money from
the economy and they never pay their
fair share.

Letters to the Editor—===-

Lastly, Mr. Bold, no one could ever
accuse you’ of being compassionate or
humanitarian. Society does not owe
anyone a living, but it certainly owes
every member the same access and the
same rights. There is no reason to
believe that society’s doctors, engineers
and computer scientists are the best it
has to offer. And I, Mr. Bold, will con-
tinue to be an egalitarian utopian, hop-
ing that opinions such as yours will
follow your definition of natural selec-
tion and be selected out for the good
of society.

The Ritual Dissent/James M. Crary

The martyrs who are most often
mourned are those who have a-
chieved something’ great. When
Martin Luther King was shot. it
was not only the death of a great
man who we cherished: it was a
symbol for the many nameless
blacks who have met with unjust
fate because of prejudice and
sliminess. When we lost John Len-
non. we lost not only a man gifted
in expressiveness. we mourned
everyone who had ever felt that
love itself was an answer. It was not
only Mahatma Ghandi who died
when he was shot, it was also every
Indian who had ever been slain in
the folly of religious rivalries.

Despite our efforts. nature re-
mains a place of struggle and
ruthlessness. Our best made plans
come to nothing. because we are
too generous or too expectant. We

survival means siding with power

power can end any dream. any

How obvious the wish of nature to
compel our acceptance of this cru-
elty quickly that she should make
it all so simple. just a puff. a quick
recoil — the gunman‘s smile of

Not only understanding. but even

refuse to discuss difficult issues.
and it is either because they cannot
find the words to discuss them, or
they are afraid of what will happen
when students realize that the edu-
cational authorities don‘t know
what to say to the most problematic
questions. the most persistent dif-
ficulties. Why is it better to hide
from the deeper issues. to live in
a blanket of confusion? Why is it

more fun to get wasted at a party
than to behave sensitively and dili-

The “Revenge Of The Nerds”  

In Texas, high school athletes are be-
ing asked to pass their courses before
suiting up for games. In Georgia. a
one-time teacher won a $2.6 million
award from the University of Georgia
after being fired for opposing favored
treatment for athletes, and the NCAA
has raised eligibility requirements for
athletes. Something is happening. Call
it the “Revenge of the Nerds.”

All across the nation, high school
and college sports programs are being
scrutinized and awful things are being
found. A professional football player.
an alumnus of a fine school, is arrested
grghgound to be functionally illiterate.

89 C03Ch€S Complain their athletes
are graduating from high school unable
to read play books. At the University
of Georgia, the now-celebrated Jan
Kemp says that athletes were admitted
who received a flat 400 score on their
college boards — what you get for
merely having a pulse.

Cynics can celebrate. America can
claim to have abolished sexism in the
exploitation of young people. Both men
and women are now exploited for their
bodies -— catching passes in their own
distinctive ways. But pardon me for
suspecting that the effort to reform
school sports had little to do with ex-
ploitation of men, women or —— in par-

" ticular — blacks. It has to do. instead.

with the nagging sense that the nerds
were right all along: that we have been
celebrating the wrong values.

The thing about excellence in sports
is that it seems, and very often is, a
gift. You either have it or you don’t.
And if you have it, and if you’re young,
you don’t have to work very hard at it.
Certainly that is the message conveyed
by, say, JimgMcMahon, the quarter-
back for the Chicago Bears. He drinks.

he parties -— and he hits his receiver ~

the next morning.
That sort of thing makes sports a

Simply Speaking/John Picone

Reaching out, being open to someone
new, is a risk, for guys and girls;
nobody wants to be hurt. But why do
guys have to be the ones to always call
the girls up, to ask and ask again, to
hold our breath and say, “Would you
like to catch a movie tonight?” I ask
girls out all the time, to see a show or
get a beer. But even just talking, about
school or about music, is filled with so
many games and pressures. It’s so
complicated. I try to understand both
sides, but it’s hard. A

Males and females each need cour-
age to meet someone new, but it’s a
very different kind of courage for the
two. Women have to put up with ‘ ‘be-
ing hit on" all the time, and it can be
a real hassle, because guys can be real
jerks, real intimidating. Amid all that,
some nice guy may speak to her and
she may take the chance, she may reach

out and let him into her life. She’s tak-
ing a risk, but look at his side — he’s
vulnerable too, and I think a lot of girls
don’t know what this does to us.

A guy has got to get a tough skin;
we’ve got to be the ones to go over and
say the first “Hello,” while it’s much
safer to sit and be quiet. No one gets
hurt when you don’t talk, when you
don’t take a chance on making a fool
of yourself. Guys start hundreds of
conversations, trying to be friendly, to
make some contact. And a lot of times,
the girls are annoyed or turn you away.
And when we ask if we can see them
sometime outside of class, we have to
take a lot of “no’s,” a lot of “I’m
busy’s,” a lot of confusion and embar-
rassment on both our parts. But if I
don’t start that conversation then I’ll
never get to speak with that girl. If I
don’t ask her out, I will never get to

target. The American celebration of the
extemporaneous. of the carefree — of
all things associated with youth — has
cost us. Japan. to us a nation of nerds.
is beating us all over the place. The
Japanese may play baseball well and ski
like champs. but in this country they
are seen as the antithesis of what youth
culture stands for. They work hard.
They study. An American student gets
an average of a half-hour a day in
homework; in Japan its two hours. In
the United States. 32 percent of 4-year-
olds attend school. In Japan the figure
is 63 percent. The typical American

student has one year of high school .

math; in Japan it's three.

The figures don’t necessarily speak
for themselves, but the results do: The
average American student is spoiled.
That is the popular judgment, too, of
the American worker, especially the
blue-collar worker —— the ones who
made all those shoddy cars. It hardly

The Trouble With Asking Girls Out

know that girl.

I. guess the’ main problem comes
from how guys can, and do, hurt girls.
The worst thing that can happen is what
they call “date rape,” when a guy tries
to force himself on a girl during a date.
Reports say some 15 percent of college
women have this happen to them. But
even if it never gets that far, the abuse
from some aggressive, intimidating guy
can still be a terrible experience.

So, sure, I want girls to be real
careful about who they go out with.
Some girls actually get physically upset
when a new guy comes up to talk to
them; they’re afraid he’s going to ask
them out or something, and it’s a has-
sle. Well, all this puts a lot of us guys
in a real bad position. I hate to be a pain
to some girl; I hate to worry or intimi-
date someone. But girls can’t and don’t
ask guys out, so I ask them.

matters that both the worker and the
student are scapegoats for awful deci-
sions made by others (management.
school boards). The fact remains that
the judgment is in: America has to
work harder. Japan. for one. says so.

The result is that sports have become
something of a scapegoat. As George-
town‘s basketball coach, John Thomp-
son. has pointed out, the real problem
is not the occasional athlete who enters
college an illiterate and exits the same
way — but all the kids who can neither
play ball nor read. The real problem
is not the student athlete who is al-
lowed to play even though his grades
are lousy, but the rest of the kids
whose grades are just as bad and never
study, either.

There are many reasons for the
criticism being leveled at school sports.
Some of it stems from jealousy: the en-
vy of the school-boy athlete who.
seemingly without effort, got the girls

It sucks sometimes. Let me just give
you some numbers to look at. An
average guy probably has to ask four
or five girls out for one to say “yes.”
They go out. and she finds out she
doesn‘t really like him‘ too ‘much.
That’s fine, and he asks five girls out
again, and again one out of five says
“yes.” Only this time he finds out he

‘doesn’t really like her too much. So

again he ask ﬁve girls and again one
out of the five says “yes,” and this
time, they hit it off well and plan to see
each other again soon. That’s great,
meanwhile that’s 15 times we had to
get the nerve up, 13 times girls had to
say “no,” all to find a new person to
go out more than once.

It gets us down sometimes, but we’ve
got to ask, or else we simply don't go
outg(with girls). This is why buddies
are nice. This is that “male bonding”

Page 5

and the glory. (May his days at the Post
Office be long and boring.)

Some of it stems from a genuine co..
cern for the well—being of the athletes
and. even. a sense of outrage that in
exchange for filling a stadium they
don‘t even learn to read. And some
comes from the corruption of what is
supposed to be amateur athletics. eve-
rything from the paying of salaries to
the awarding of bonuses. There is a lot
to object to here. (

But the most telling criticism comes
from the nerds. It is they who see the
abuse of school sports as representing
what’s bad about American education
in general: its emphasis on fun, extem-
poraneous activity and instant gratiﬁca-
tion. When these become paramount,
when they finally come to corrupt
whole institutions, then it is clear that
the wrong values are being celebrated.
The nerds have been saying that all
along. Now they have their revenge.

they talk about: Your buddies are
always there; your buddies will never
let you down. You can even have some
female buddies who you can always go
to. But all buddies are safe - they
don‘t want anything from you; they’re
just good friends.’ .

I’m not trying to sound like some ex-
pert or something, but this is a subject
that’s real important to me. I think part
of the reason I’m here is to know as
many people as I can, to touch as many
lives as I can while I’m here. Girls,
please don’t be annoyed with us, even
when too many guys‘ are asking you.
If some guy asks you out, tell him the
truth if you can, “yes, no, maybe on
the weekend sometime” — and try not
to hurt his feelings. And someday, I
hope someday, maybe, some young
woman will come up and ask me out.
Maybe someday

who could. voted. Brzezinski pointed
out that communist states ficticiously
allege their leaders to have been
unanimously re-elected.

"A communist system." Brzezinski
said. “is unique in that it aims to subor-
dinate a society to a political system
and then reconstruct the society around
that system. In Marxist states. thus, the
relationship between government and
society is generally integrated — there
is one unity. Such is not the case in
Poland. We now see a separate socie-
ty with its own values.“

The Solidarity movement, Brzezin-
ski feels, was one of the first societal
units to develop values independent of
those of the state.

If it continues, Polish society's in-
creasing divergence from Marxist
thought could, Brzezinski contends,
bring about the demise of communism

in Poland and perhaps the world.

"If ‘communism in Poland fails. it
could have significant international
ramifications,“ he said. "It could
represent the beginning of the end of
the communist system."

Brzezinski admits. however, much is
yet to be done if such a scenario is to
become a reality. Poland. he said, is
currently maligned by intense
economic and ecological difficulties
which, if left unresolved, could
submerge the country in communist
subjugation indeﬁnitely. These prob-
lems are compounded, Brzezinski con-
tends, by Soviet unwillingness to
resolve them. The Kremlin believes it
can better keep the lid on any
economically depressed nation than one
in which hope and opportunity abound.

“The Soviets," Brzezinski said,

“have a very sophisticated way of con-
trolling Poland.”

First, there’s a time commitment. You don‘t solo overnight. You
must be prepared to dedicate yourself to an intensive training program
lasting some 40 weeks.

You must meet some special physical and mental require-
ments to enroll, then complete basic training and pre-flight training
before you be in your Warrant Officer Flight Training course.

But all at time, the hurdles, the training rigors all seem worth-
while once you lift the skids from the ground, sure of your ability to
make it move to your touch. To fly.

To qualify, you must have a high school diploma, be at least 17,
not older than 27 1/ 2 at enlistment.

Once you become a Warrant Officer pilot, you'll retum to a
local Army Reserve unit and train one weekend a month (usually) and
two weeks a year for at least 48 months.

If you can make the commitment, and pass the tests, you could
be on your way to wearing wings. If you’re interested, here’s where

social habits. Preferring solitude, they
were rarely sighted in groups. Of these,
the most common seemed to be two
females traveling together. Rarely were
two males seen together. Upon meet-
ing, the males would often ﬁght, literal-
ly soaking the leaves and ground with
blood.

Touching on perhaps the most im-
portant point of the night-, Galdikas ex-
plained the single most signiﬁcant point
she has learned through the years.

“Humility," she said, choosing her
words carefully. “I feel humble to
share this planet, this spaceship Earth,
with creatures so much like myself —
I have come to accept the duality of my
own human nature better. That 98 per-
cent [genetic material] which I share
with the orangutans has helped me to
understand the duality of human nature
— part angel, part beast. It is not
something uniquely human, but some-
thing we brought with us millions of
years ago when our ancestors left the
forest.”

Galdikas currently is spending three
months at Simon Fraser University in
British Columbia, Canada. Later in the
year, she will return to Indonesia to
continue her work.

The Pitt News, March 3. 1986

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

LANDOVER, Md. — As the Pitt
basketball team left the Capital Center
on Saturday afternoon following the
93-62 thrashing at the hands of
Georgetown, one of the team vans
failed to start —— the battery was dead.

It was typical of the entire season.
Just as that battery lacked spark to start
the engine, the Panthers have played
without a spark for the past month, and
seemed to finally hit bottom on Satur-
day. It was the team’s ‘worst defeat
since the mid—70s.

The Panthers will have one final
chance to redeem themselves this
Thursday when they play the same
Georgetown team in the first round of

“There has been a lot of
talking done with this team.
They haven ’t done it on the
court yet. They have to go out
and prove it on the court. ”

—— Roy Chipman

the Big East Championship at 3 p.m.

Pitt head coach Roy Chipman will
have to revive his comatose squad if it
is going to have any hope of advanc-
ing past the tournament’s first round —
something Pitt has never accomplished.

“We just have to bounce back,”
Chipman said. “We play the same club
again on Thursday. Hopefully, maybe
they will be a little over—confident and
maybe we can show a little bit of pride
by bouncing back to play better than
we did.”

Playing better may not be that hard
to accomplish ~ it cannot get much
worse than it was on Saturday. The
Panthers shot only 41 percent from the
field, were out—rebounded by the
Hoyas 38-24, and committed 20 turn-
overs. Those are not winning numbers
against a team like Georgetown. Chip-

Sports

 Pitt loss a fitting ending to season

man has three days left to make ad-
justments, but does not see any major
changes in order.

“I, as a coach, to be perfectly frank
with you, do not think I am going to
be able to do it,” Chipman said. “It’s
an internal thing with the team. The
players have to say, ‘Hey, we were
humiliated, and we better go out and
do a better job come Thursday’.”

The Panthers will attempt to regain
the form they had in January when they
beat the same Hoyas 80-76, in front of
a capacity crowd at the Civic Arena.

Pitt had been utilizing a smaller
lineup at that time, with Charles Smith
playing center, but Chipman does not
plan to revert back to that strategy.

“At this point,” Chipman said, “I
think we are pretty heavily committed

«to the lineup that we have been going

with.”

So with no major lineup changes
forthcoming, it is obvious that Chip-
man believes much of the problem of
his slumping squad lies with the
players, and he intends to leave it up
to them to correct it.

“There has been a lot of talking done
with this team," Chipman said. “They
haven’t done it on the court yet. They
have to go out and prove it on the
court.”

He gave his players a chance to think
about it among themselves following
the game Saturday, making the locker-
room off limits to the media. How they
will react to the loss remains to be seen.

Game Notes: Georgetown’s David
Wingate had a career—high 26 points to
lead all scorers. Teammate Reggie
Williams added 18 points but pulled
down 10 rebounds. Demetreus Gore
led the Panthers with 21 points while
Charles Smith added 15, despite tak-
ing only six shots from the field.
Georgetown, as a team, took 23 more
shots than Pitt did from the field. 
Last year, in the regular season final,
Pitt humiliated Villanova at the field
house, then lostiin the first round of the
Big East Championship to Villanova.
 Pitt’s hopes for an NCAA bid are
virtually gone. Chipman, who resigned
Dec. 18 effective the end of the season,
could be. coaching his last game at the

tournament.  The Panthers have now Charles Smith bi0CkS 3 Shot b

enough, as Georgetown crushed Pitt by 31 points.

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

After a long and grueling season for
the Pitt wrestling team, just two sur-
vivors remain. Following this past
weekend’s Eastern Wrestling League
Championships. senior co—captain Kyle
Nellis and freshman sensation Pat San-
toro earned the right to go onto the
NCAA National Championships
March 13-15 following their second-
place finishes.

The only other Panther to place was
Eric Wertz, who finished fourth at 167
pounds. The only way Wertz could
have gained a berth was to be picked
as a wild-card selection. A loss in the
consolation finals denied him that
opportunity.

One of the Panthers going for sure
is Nellis. Despite his being Pitt’s all-
time winningest wrestler. he will make
his first appearance at Nationals. It has
been a long time coming, but the
dedication put forth by Nellis during
the past four years has paid off.

“I‘m very happy for Kyle." said
head coach Rande Stottlemyer. “He's
finally got the bear off his back. Kyle
has always been good enough to go [to
Nationals]. and now he has his
chance.”

To earn his spot at the champion-
ships. Nellis had to first avenge an
earlier season loss to Penn State's Joe
Hadge.

In the semifinals, Nellis had to face
Hadge, who defeated him in the Pitt-
Penn State dual meet 4-3. However, it
was a different story this time as Nellis
won when it really counted by domi-
nating his opponent 9-2. By virtue of
a win in the semiﬁnals, Nellis automati-

cally earned his bid to Nationals.
Nationals.

“It’s just relieving to finally make
it," said Nellis. "This is the whole
reason I’ve worked so hard. ljust wish
that I had done better in the finals
against [Paul] Clark."

Despite winning an opportunity to
make the trip to the University of Iowa
for the NCAAs, Nellis had some empty
feelings following his loss in the ﬁnals.
The opposition for Nellis in the finals
was Clark. the nation’s second—ranked
l34—pound wrestler from Clarion. The
match was tied 4-4 with one minute
left. but Clark prevailed in an im-
pressive finale 8-4. Despite the loss,
Nellis’ career .won’t end for another
two weeks, and his teammate, Santoro,
certainly has appreciated his presence.

“He really worked for it all year,”
said Santoro. “He's been a big inspira-
tion for me all season."

Some of Nellis‘ success must have
rubbed off. as Santoro is Pitt’s other
representative. Santoro, like Nellis,
had little trouble getting to the finals,
but he too hit a road block in his at-
tempt to capture an EWL champion-
ship. After battling Clarion‘s Mike
Cole to a 4-4 draw in regulation time,

y Georgetown’s Ralph Dalton. It wasn’t nearly

Page ‘II

Chaz Palla/The Pitt News

 

His head to Nationals

Cole needed an overtime match to
decide the champion at 142 pounds.

In three prior confrontations, Cole
had won out over Santoro two times.
In their fourth meeting of the season,
Cole walked away the winner follow-
ing his 6-4 decision over Santoro. After
suffering an overtime loss to his rival
from Clarion, Santoro felt a little
troubled by his performance.

“I’m a little excited,” said Santoro.
“I‘m happy to go to Nationals, but
things just haven’t been clicking for
me. I‘ve been a little frustrated lately,
and I’m just lucky to be able to go.”

Nellis, the team‘s leader on and off
the mat. holds a high regard for his
teammates abilities. Earlier in the
year, Nellis was quoted as saying San-
toro could end up an All—America in
only his first season. Today, the Pan-
thers‘ co—captain still stands by his
words.

“He definitely can be [an All-
America] still,” said Nellis. “A lot of
it has to do with the seedings and the
matchups. Pat will also have to be very
intense, but I’m sure that won’t be a
problem.“

If Santoro has anything to do about
it, there may be some folks in Iowa that
may be in for a surprise.

“I‘m not going to Iowajust to show
up." replied Santoro when asked what
he expects out of his trip to the Mid-
west. “I want to do something out
there. I’m just going to shoot for the
top.”

Lady gymnasts get easy Win

By Julia Stitely
Staff Writer

It was the same old story for the Lady
Panther gymnasts as they trounced
visiting Bowling Green State Univer-
sity. 176.15-166.95. They won all four
events handily but again turned in
disappointing performances on the
uneven parallel bars and the balance
beam.

“We’re still looking for that meet
where we do everything perfect. ” said
Pitt head coach Donna Sanft. “We only
have three more chances to get it
right.”

Vault and ﬂoor exercise were Pitt’s
strongest events, as usual. Freshman
Trish Aser won both events with scores
of 9.15. Pitt’s Alisa Spector finished
close behind Aser on vault with a 9.05.
Spector’s handspring front somersault

vault was the most difficult jump
shown. Bowling Green had its highest
finish in the meet with a third place by
Shelley Staley.

Pitt swept the floor exercise. taking
all of the top three places. Kim Cald-
erone finished second behind Aser with
a 9.05. Kristy Pieters and Stephanie
Megill tied for third place with scores
of 9.0. The Lady Panthers had their
highest event total here with a 45.15.

Balance beam was the worst event
for both teams. Aser and Spector tied
for top honors with scores of 9.05.
Pieters was back in third with an 8.45.
The remaining Lady Panthers regis-
tered falls. Bowling Green’s scores
ranged from a low of 7.2 to a high of
8.25. Bowling Green’s routines were
comparable in difficulty to Pitt’s but
were not as well—choreographed and
polished. Most of the Bowling Green
routines were riddled with falls.

Megill started things off right on
bars with an 8.9 but Pitt was up and
down from there. Sophomore Beth
Waters had the highest score. 9.35.
Spector was right behind Megill with
an 8.75. Mistakes kept the other scores
low for Pitt. Bowling Green‘s top per-
formance came from Ellen DiCola with
an 8.4.

Spector again won the all—around
competition with a 35.8. Pitt demon-
strated its depth advantage as Waters.
Pieters and Megill were second. third
and fourth with scores of 35.1, 35.0
and 34.55. respectively. Sanft men-
tioned Megill as the most improved
gymnast in the meet.

The Lady Panthers travel to Ohio
State University next weekend to face
the top team in the region and one of

the best teams in the nation. “Our

quest is to improve our team score."
Sanft said.

Women eliminated at tourney

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers played their finest
game of the season last Friday against
the Syracuse Orangewomen. but the
result was a heart—breaking 58-57 loss
in the first round of the Big East Cham-
pionships at Boston College.

The loss. Pitt’s third against the
Orangewomen this year, dropped the
Lady Panthers’ final season record to
11-16 overall and 5-12 in the
conference.

Syracuse went on to the semiﬁnals,
but lost to Villanova, 69-61. The
Orangewomen ended their year at
19-10 and 13-5.

The first-half action was controlled
by Pitt, although it wasn‘t evident in
the Lady Panthers’ 28-25 halftime lead
as much as it was in the tempo of the
game. Pitt was able to slow down the
pace, prohibiting the quicker Orange-
women from turning the contest into a
track meet.

Syracuse head coach Barbara Jacobs
agreed. “In the ﬁrst half, Pitt frustrated
us and we played their game instead of
playing ours." said Jacobs.

The Orangewomen led 15-10 at the
10: 13 mark. but senior guard Kim
Gannis took over for the Lady Pan-
thers. In the next five minutes Gannis
pumped in five baskets. the last of
which gave Pitt a comfortable 22-15
lead with 4:51 left in the half.

Pitt has been inconsistent all year and
it couldn't have been more evident than
it was in the final minutes of the half.
After building its seven—point margin
Pitt took a nose dive as Syracuse went
on a 10-2 run to regain the lead, 25-24.
But the Lady Panthers recovered with
a 6-2 run of their own to take a three-
point lead into the locker room at
halftime.

At the beginning of the second half
Pitt scored six consecutive points to
take a commanding nine-point lead
34-25. forcing Syracuse to call a time
out. L

The Orangewomen chipped away at
the Lady Panther lead. but Pitt still led
36-30 with 12:36 left in the game.
Syracuse appeared in trouble against an
inferior opponent. but they opened up
the fast break to regain the lead. The
Orangewomen scored 13 of the game's
next 15 points to grab a 43-38 margin.

The Lady Panthers fought back and .

had a chance to take the lead with a
minute left in the game as sophomore
guard Valerie Halesworth stepped to
the line for a one-and-one with the
score tied at 55.

But I-Ialesworth’s shot missed and
Syracuse subsequently sank three of
four free throws and had the ball with
a slim 58-57 lead with 33 seconds left.

The Orangewomen held the ball and
Pitt decided not to foul. forcing
Syracuse to take a shot with three ticks
on the clock. The shot missed but the
clock ran out as the two teams scram-
bled for the loose ball.

It seemed to be a very unwise deci-
sion not to foul. The chances of get-

ting a rebound. driving the ball down
court and taking a shot all in three
seconds are very slim.

But Lady Panther head coach Kirk
Bruce felt otherwise. "We wanted
them to take a quick shot so we could
have time to get another shot." said
Bruce.

It appeared the 30-second shot clock
went off before Syracuse attempted the
shot, but Bruce wasn’t sure. “I thought
the shot clock went off [before she
shot]. but in the heat of the game your
mind always doesn't work like
everyone else’s.”

Syracuse’s Jacobs was impressed,
but not surprised, with Pitt’s perform-
ance. “We had to play up a [higher]
level because Pitt really came out at us.
They played a really great game,” said
Jacobs.

“It‘s always hard to beat a team three
times in a year. And, Pitt is not a bad
team." added Jacobs. “They are young
and they have been playing better and
better as the year has gone on.”

Coach Bruce felt that Syracuse’s
ability to penetrate and pick up the tem-
po in the second half was the Lady Pan-

thers‘ downfall. "We weren‘t stepping
up to the top of the key to stop the ball.
[Syracuse point guard] Janice Long‘s
game is penetration and we allowed her
to do that." said_Bruce. "If Long gets
into the paint she‘s going to score or
draw somebody to her and dish off."

Gannis. who concluded a very fine
senior season for Pitt, led the Lady
Panthers with 16 points and 7 assists.
Senior guard Kim Tirik scored 14
points and junior forward Sally Sheerer
added 10 points and 11 rebounds for
Pitt.

Syracuse placed four players in
double figures. Long had 14 points,
while forward Sue Ludwig. guard Lor-
raine Williams and center Bonnie
Baker had 11 points each. Baker also
had a career-high 16 rebounds for the
Orangewomen.

NOTES: Tirik ended her illustrious
Lady Panther career with 884 points,
sixth place on the all-time Pitt scoring
list.  The loss was Pitt‘s ﬁfth straight
against Syracuse and the second
straight season the Lady Panthers lost
to the Orangewomen by a single point
in the first round of the tournament.
