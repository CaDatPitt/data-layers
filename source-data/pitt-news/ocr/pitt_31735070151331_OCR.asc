Pitt quarterback Tom Savage is expected to
play at Virginia Tech Oct. 12 after reporting
concussion—like symptoms in the fourth
quarterlof Saturday’s game, the University
announced Monday.

. Pitt athletics spokesman E.J. Borghet-
ti said in a press‘ release that Savage has
shown only mild symptoms and continues
to make progress on a daily basis.

Savage exited Pitt’s 14-3 victory over
Virginia prematurely Saturday, as he _suf—
fered a helmet-to.-helmet hit on a rush at-
tempt late in the third quarter. Savage was
ﬂushed from the backﬁeld by the Cavaliers’
pass rush and gave himself up when he slid
to Pitt’s 30-yard line after a 14-yard carry.

As Savage slid, Virginia linebacker
Daquan Romero came in and made hel-
met-to-helmet contact with Savage, leaving
Pitt’s quarterback prone and in pain.

Receiver Tyler Boyd was close to the
play when it happened, and he said Sav-
age got up slowly when Boyd tried to help

-Mayoral budget subject to oversight review

John Lavanga .
A€9°E Editor

Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s budget
proposal for next year includes a $9 million
increase over last year’s proposal with no
planned change in taxes. .
Last Tuesday, Ravenstahl unveiled his
proposed budget for 2014. The budget ——
which is currently under reviewby Pitts-
burgh’s Intergovernmental Cooperation

Authority, the state’s oversight board —
totals $479 million. Ravenstal1l’s office has
also budgeted charitable contributions from
nonproﬁts, which in the past have raised con-
cerns among those who provide oversight.

' Next week, the oversight board may reject

Ravenstahl’s proposal because such dona-
tions are projected, and thus not guaranteed.

Now that Ravenstahl-has proposed his
budget, Pittsburgh’s Intergovernmental

Chancellor forum receives varied opinions from students, alumni

Danielle Fox
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Academiaaside, audience members at
last night’s chancellor search forum
said they are looking for a chancellor
who understands the importance of
athletics, even if he or she doesn’t un-
derstand the rules of a ball game.

“As an integral part of the university,
[athletics] is probably the best PR tool
we have,” alumnus Joseph Barack said.
“It also serves as a bridge to the rest
of the city, which is a largely untapped
potential.” .

Approximately 50 people attended
the chancellor search forum, including
students involved with organizations
such as the Student Government Board,
the Rainbow Alliance and the Black Ac-
tion Society. Members of Pitt’s staff
and faculty were also present, as were
alumni. Attendees discussed their views
on the qualities that the replacement
for Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, who

 it

its debt while simultaneously limiting how
much government funding it receives.
Since 1987, 27 municipalities have en-
tered into Act 47 oversight — the most re-
cent being the cities of Harrisburg in 2010
and Altoona in 2012 — including eight in
Allegheny County. Only six of these munici-
palities have had Act 47 status rescinded.
Though the authority and Act 47 are sepa-
rate programs, board member Ann Dugan
said they play complementary roles in the
state’s oversight of the city’s ﬁnances. While
the authority has the ability to approve the
budget, Act 47 gives guidelines for budget
proposals.
According to Dugan, the mayor’s ofﬁce
has overestimated the sums of charitable
contributions from nonproﬁts in recent

plans to retire next July, should have.

This was the ﬁnal search committee
forum held on Pitt’s main campus.

Each of the first two forums, which
were held Sept. 18 and Sept. 20, drew
20 people, none of whom were Pitt stu-
dents.

Forums have also been held at Pitt’s
johnstown, Titusville and Greensburg
campuses. Another is scheduled for
Wednesday at the Bradford campus. The
search committee has also hosted fo-
rums in cities including Atlanta, Hous-
ton and Philadelphia. Another forum is
scheduled to take place in San Francisco
on Friday. '

Brandon Benjamin, president of the
Rainbow Alliance,‘said he hopes the
next chancellor will be open to educat-
ing himself or herself to social concerns
and issues affecting students. He said
he wanted to see a chancellor more in
line with the direction the University’s
student body, which he considers lib-
eral, is traveling.

years, including those from Pitt.

“These [contributions] carmot be taken
for granted  That’s been our problem with
the mayor’s ofﬁce. They assume that it’s go-
ing to increase every year,” she said.

According to the 2014 budget, the total
amount of projected “payment from non-
proﬁts for services” during the upcoming
year is projected to be $3.19 million, or
roughly $200,000 less than the $3.4 mil-
lion projected for 2013.

In 2012, the actual amount contributed
was roughly $4.99 million.

Ken Service, Pitt’s vice chancellor
for communications, said the University
makes contributions to the city through the
Pittsburgh Public Service Fund, to which

numerous nonproﬁt groups across the city
contribute. Service said the fund for this year
includes $2.6 million in planned donations.

Service said individual amounts that Pitt
and other organizations contribute to the

“[Rainbow Alliance is] a very ac-.

tive group at a relatively conservative
university in a liberal city in a conser-
vative state in a liberal country in a
conservative world,” Benjamin said.
“It’s something that we are trying to
navigate.  We have to address a lot of

' different issues that come up in a very

conservative way.” g
Kevin Kearns, a professor at Pitt’s

Graduate School of Public and Inter- ,
national Affairs, said he considered

increasing diversity to be one of the
most important missions of the next
chancellor. ’ ‘

Two members of the Black Action So-
ciety who were at the meeting, includ-
ing president Chandel Boozer, voiced
their agreement with Kearns.

In addition to the panel, search com-
mittee members Amelia Brause (who is
also a member of SGB) and Richard Col-
well (who served on the search commit-
tee that chose Chancellor Nordenberg)
were present in the audience.

fund are not disclosed.
During last year’s budget review, the

intergovernmental Cooperation Author-

ity expressed concern that the projected
increases in these contributions were exces-
sive, Dugan said.

Next Tuesday, the authoritywill convene
to decide whether to approve the proposed
budget or send it back for changes. Much
of this decision is based on scrutinizing the
projected revenue to ensure that the assump-
tions made by the city are correct.

Pittsburgh Assistant Director of Finance
Nick Lyons described Ravenstahl’s proposal
as a “baseline budget,” noting that the only
major change was an additional $25 million
in pension contributions.

Meanwhile, Lyons’ colleague Assistant
Director of Finance Cathy Qureshi said that
the nonproﬁt contributions in the budget
are calculated based on signed contracts
with nonproﬁts, as well as by looking at past

Alumna Susan Heiss worked at the
University while she was obtaining
her two degrees from Pitt. Heiss, who
graduated in 2009, said the new chan-
cellor must make him or herself avail-
able and approachable to the all of the
student body. 1 e
‘ Heiss recounted a story to the panel
in which she was waiting on a street cor-
ner on Fifth Avenue. Nordenberg stood
beside Heiss and a group of students,
waiting for the light to turn.

“No one else seemed to know who
he was. He was just a guy in a suit,”
she said. .

She said that she wanted to see a
chancellor who could connect with
more students.

“I would like a chancellor who, when
standing on the street corner, can turn
to the person next to him and say, ‘Are
you on your way to lunch?’ [or] ‘What
class did you just leave?”’ she said. I

trends in contributions.

“The city has received the revenues in
this line item consistently,” Qureshi said
in an email.

The budget also includes a section that
lists 31 new positions in government that .

8th District City Councilman Bill Peduto,
the Democratic mayoral candidate and pre-

_ sumptive winner, recommended.

Although the budget includes no provi-
sions for funding these, Peduto’s ofﬁce said
he will try to ﬁnd ways to fund the newly
named positions while balancing the budget.

“If we add positions, then we will need
to remove positions at the same time,” Dan
Gilman, Peduto’s chiefof staff in City Council,
said in an email. “We will not be increasing
the budget to bring on new positions.”

According to the budget itself, Peduto

voluntarily submitted his proposals for con-
sideration. It adds that the mayor’s ofﬁce in-
cluded the recommendations “in the spirit of
cooperation and government stewardship.”

Although Republican mayoral candidate
Josh Wander is currently traveling abroad, he
wrote in an email last week that Ravenstahl
made no eﬁbrt to reachout to him during the
budget-drafting process, and he described

October 1 , 2018 i The Pitt News i vvvx/w.pittrtevvs.com

the inclusion of Peduto’s recommendations
as “premature.” g

Wander recently sold his Pittsburgh
home in Squirrel Hill and is currently work-
ing in Israel as a security consultant. He said
that the sale of his home had nothing to do
with his status as a candidate for mayor.
Instead, he made the sale because of the
neighborhood’s booming real estate market.

“If elected, I would immediately resign
my current position to lead the city,” he ‘said
in an email.

It is unclear when Wander will return to

i
Pittsburgh, but he said that he aims to at-
tend all scheduled debates between himself
and Peduto.

Members of the Peduto campaign had no
comments on Wander’s absence, simply say-
ing that they look forward to seeing Wander
at the scheduled debates.

Voting for the mayoral election will take
place Nov. 5.

If the budget is approved, it will be pre-
sented to City Council in November for ap-
proval. But the process could begin anew
come January if the next mayor decides to

reopen the budget and make signiﬁcant
changes.

Dugan anticipates looking at a newly
proposed budget this January.

“Change always brings a ripple effect of
change,” Dugan said. “I would assume that
a new mayor would really want to careﬁilly
look at the budget and the revenue sources
and develop a new approach.”

Gilman said Peduto wants to avoid this
extra step, if elected, by being involved in
the budget-revision processas a City Council
member. -

“We will continue to work with the ad-
ministration and City Council throughout the
budget process so that we can go into next
year with a budget we all support,” he said.

Obama, Putin and the necessary demise of
American exceptionalism

Rohith Palli
Columnist

The debate is getting heated. Is
America exceptional? Russian
President Vladimir Putin certainly
doesn’tthink so. Infact, he statedin
aNew York Times op—ed published
on Sept. 11 that, “It is extremely dan-
gerous to encourage people to see
themselves as exceptional, whatever
the motivation.”

President Barack Obama, on the
other hand, repeatedly reaﬂirms the
notion ofAmerican exceptionalism
—ﬁrstinthe speech that instigated
Putin’s remarks, and then again at
his United Nations address last
week. At the United Nations, Obama
jabbed back at Putin, “Some may
disagree, butlbelieve thatAmerica
is exceptional.” .

Unfortunately, these Presidents
were talking past each other en-
tirely.

Obama is defendingthe not-so-
farfetched idea that American will-
ingness to cautiously involve itself in
foreign conflicts forthe betterment
of those people makes the nation
somehow special or exceptional. By
and large this is true; there are not
that many nations willing to take
such action in today’s world.

Putin claims it is dangerous for
America to claim to be exceptional.
He has apoint, too, butl don’tthink
it’s a counterpoint to Obama’s cau-
tious willingness to argue in favor of
American exceptionalism. We can
argue about semantics, but I think
Putin should be — though he isn’t
— pressing back against another,

more prevalent concept in the na-
tional dialogue.

The idea that America is the
greatest nation on earth can only
hold up in an antirealist framework.
Before even considering veracity,
one has to grapple with the fact
that “great” is so nebulous a term
that the Merriam—Webster online
dictionary gives 11 deﬁnitions for it.

One of these deﬁnitions calls
it “remarkable in magnitude, de-
gree or effectiveness.” I think many
people who would want to call the
United States the greatest nation
would hesitate to say it is the most
effective nation.

But this worldview is so in-
grained in the political and cultural

atmosphere that it is a prerequisite to even
holding national office. But are these claims
justified? V

By the standard ‘of living of the average
citizen, I think not. A claim of being “a great
nation on earth” or “the freest nation on
earth” wouldbe worth arguingfor and worth
maintaining.

tions argue that we must return to the roots
given to us by the framers of the constitutions
— but who wants to return to principles em-
bodied in the 18th century?

We live in the here and now and need to
take on the principles of the here and now. We
don’t have the greatest constitution. In fact,
the constitution is full of idiosyncrasies, ves-
tigial government functions and now- deﬁmct
ways of viewing. the world.

Yet the greatest charge that can be levied
against a law is that it is unconstitutional,

But this faceless notion of American great-

not that it is immoral, unfair or unjust. Part

our freedoms.

An argument can be made that we live
in a nation that grants exceptional personal
freedoms and that this should garner respect
forthe institutions thatperpetuate those free-
doms, including the Constitution in which

they originated. But this misses the point: The ‘

lack ofharmful actions, namely the restriction
of core freedoms, does not guarantee that
all or even a majority of virtuous actions are
being taken. '

Ultimately, the wheels of capitalism and

corruption have broken down our system i

the government is indiscriminately downsiz-
ing and constantly on the brink of disaster.
In alesser country, this might lead to a dis-
cussion about how to ﬁx-the system that went
somewhere, but here in the greatest nation on
earth, we are left to listen to CNN’s “predic-

l tions” and pray that someday our government

will magically regain the ability to govern.
So Putin was right: It is dangerous to tell

people that the United States of American is

exceptional. Not because we are a nation of

» warmongers, but rather because we, as a na-

tion, need the ability to move forward 4 and

ness can even get in the way of real progress.
For example, the constitutional literalist fac-

of this comes from the idea that the Consti-
tution doesanear-perfect job ofvprotfecting

stretched a block down Penn Avenue

Esquire TV’s

line up puts

stylish spin
on basic TV
rundown

Matt Singer
Senior Staﬁ“ Writer

Its initial programming launch now com-
pleted, it’s already clear that Esquire Net-
work is continuing to do what its epony-
mous magazine has already succeeded in
doing: showing that class, culture and cash
can make men think something is cool and
— most importantly — new.

This “new” factor is made most obvi-
ous by the network’s lineup of original
content, which is currently mixed with
reruns of other shows, such as “Parks and
Recreation” and week—old episodes of “Late
Night With Jimmy Fallon.” Esquire Net-
work’s self—made series seem incredibly
similar to programs that already exist:
There’s a travel show created by Anthony
Bourdain, a cooking competition, some
guys doing difﬁcult physical challenges
and two brewers drinking beer all across
America.

So if all of this “origina ” content comes
off as rehashed versions of pre—existing
shows with slimmer ﬁts of button-up shirts
and nicer sunglasses, why would anyone
bother to tune in?

Well, the answer to that lies in Esquire’s
tried and true “coolness.”

The 80-year-old magazine holds a
hyper-speciﬁc niche that has generated

intense brand loyalty. And although there
are other magazines out there that target
we1l—off and stylish men, Esquire is known
for its sense of reliability. It never falters
and never tries to be what it’s not. Its fo-
cus is on making men more cultured and
exploring the world through new experi-
ences.

Myriad cutting-edge musicians such as De-troit’s own Jimmy Edgar wiil descend upon the ‘Burgh for VIA.

PREVIEW

. In its 4th year, VIA continues to evolve

Jeff Ihaza
Stay?” Writer

Artistically, Pittsburgh is one of the coun-
try’s burgeoning centers for innovation.
The birthplace of Andy Warhol lends it-
self to creative types’ continued explora-
tion of ways to engage their world. The
VIA festival, now in its fourth year, is an
embodiment of a playfully creative spirit
that could be the new wave of art in the
information age.

The annual live music and arts festival
incorporates the city as a playground for
its ﬁnely curated exhibitions of musicians
and visual artists who, like the city itself,
push the boundaries of expression. This
year may perhaps be the festival’s most
eclectic, and thus fully realized, to date.

With a lineup that pairs acclaimed vi-

sual artists with musicians on the cutting
edge, VIA 2013 looks to take the festival’s
existing model for success and continue
to build on it.

As always, the festival will take place
across the city, with performances held
at places as disparate as Carnegie Mel-
lon University, Thunderbird Cafe in

Lawrenceville and a recently announced V

temporary venue located at 5854 Baum
Blvd. in East Liberty.

The musicians featured in the event
range from up-and-coming local artists
—— such as Shisa, Dream Weapon and Nic
Lawless and His Young Criminales — to
genre—bending, internationally renowned
acts such as Detroit’s Jimmy Edgar, Bul-
garia’s Kink and Pittsburgh’s own Sharon
Needles.

On the visual side of things, there is a

V similar mix. The work of Kevin Ramser,

local visual artist and staplelofVIA’s now-
defunct 6119 venue, will be featured at
the festival, as well as myriad out— of-town
artists, such as Poland—based V5MT.
Lauren Goshinski, the festival’s found-
er, says that this year’s selection of artists
transcends simple genre lines. The festival

is instead interested in exploring the ways i

in which people and cultures interact.
“We have never booked VIA to be fo-
cused on a speciﬁc genre and are not in-

ESQUIRE

And when looked at through that lens,
Esquire Network’s lineup starts to appear
to be more than just regurgitations of al-
ready-on-air culture shows. A

“The Getaway” is a show that features
celebrities visiting far-off destinations.
Although this premise has been done be-
fore, it is effectively Esquire-d by ‘having
the stars do more than just wine and dine.
They’re supposed to absorb the culture
and the history of the place they’re visit-
ing.  a1though»that’s supposedly the
purpose of every destination show, the

Finally,,“Brew Dogs” -— which is much
less bro-ish than it sounds —— follows two
Scottish beer brewers as they move across
America and, well, brew beer. They make
it a point to use ingredients speciﬁc to
each city ‘through which they pass, which
makes for a_ hokey yet adorable relation-

’ ’ to be well-received
‘by audiences and

two chefs against
each other and
then surprising them with random ingredi-

' ents, but it’s supposed to go off the beaten

track and focus on a sleek and simple set-
ting with relatively unknown cooks. It’s a
short, not in-depth show that’s meant to
be a short burst of cooking programming
— a way for non-foodies to dip their toes
into the water and see what the experi-
ence is like. V

For readers-turned-viewers who wish
to see a show in which the hosts pit them-
selves against grueling odds and push the
limits of their body, “Boundless” is sup-
posed to be a location-focused adrena-
line rush. Starring two Canadian athletes
who try to tackle eight endurance races in
ﬁve months, “Boundless” should expose

viewers to some of the most challenging ‘

physical trials in the world. But rather

than alpha—male dial'ogue‘between the two V
hosts, the time between exhausted gasps T

of air is instead ﬁlled with appreciation of
the locale, the human body’s capabilities

.-. and the race’s ability to merge an under-

one-dimensional

meet the needs and fulﬁll the desires of
viewers,‘ Esquire Network will do very well
for the same reason that meatheads enjoy
the network Spike. .
Many of the networks that appear t
be robust these days actually follow a rela-
tively common pattern when determining
their programming, with the core concepts
of shows being malleable to ﬁt each net-
work’s audiences. All the network has to
do is slap a new name on it and ﬁnd a host
who embodies the network’s “it factor.”
And the Esquire Network is no different.
The men that read Esquire do so be-
cause they want to be told what is _cool,
and they like how the magazine answers.
They like the idea of sophisticated counte-
nances, higher-than—average price tags and
food of which they’ve never heard. They
like the answers so much so that they’re
willing to hear more of them and in dif-
ferent forms. And now they’ll continue to
hear these types of answers on the televi-
sion instead of just reading them on paper.

Following more than a dozen stage
dives, a snapped microphone cord and
numerous chants of “Bronson! Bron-

red beard and unexceptional dress of
Action Bronson, who opened his set
with “NaNa,” a collaborative track with
Chance the Rapper, before diving into
“Alligator,” a song, off his recently re-

immediately provided a counterpoint
to “I/3ronson’s more relaxed and lyrical

who notonly exemplify their sub—genre,
but who also‘ reveal a sound or culture,
usually before pop life can appropriate it
(or massive festivals take notice). We hope
these performances help prime audiences
to be discerning about cultural phenom-
enon in a sensitive and respectful way.”
This year, that culture is as young as
it has ever been, with entirely new art-
ists making up a number of the festival’s
headliners. This growing inﬂuenfce~ of

youth culture is a natural response to a_

world that continuously moves online and

is rapidly being placed in the -hands ‘of

young people.

“We think that having the youngest
lineup to datereﬂects ayglobalwave of
what’s happening across music, art and
technology,” Goshinski said. I

VIA’s continued exploration of new

frontiers in art and technology is what .
made the partnership with this ‘year’s
Carnegie International exhibition'seem'

almost instinctual. Guests who purchase
a “passport pass” will gain access to all of
Carnegie International’s exhibits, as well
as VIA’s week—long schedule of festivities.

Jonathan Gaugler, the media relations
manager for the Carnegie Museum of Art,
said that when the Carnegie. International
curators. were putting the exhibition to-

I gether, incorporating VIA seemed like a
a good ﬁt. =

“Well, our opening weekend falls
smack in the center of VIA, and visual
art is so integral to what they’re doing that
it seemed to just make sense. We called
them up thinking, ‘What better ﬁt for the
International than that‘?”’ Gaugler said.

VIA is unique in that it’s one of the few,
if not only, U.S. festivals with as much

. focus on visualarts as musical acts. Ter-

ence O’Toole, a junior English literature
and music major, called last year’s festival
“one of the most unique experiences [he’s]
ever had.” He says he looks forward to this
year’s festivities because of how vibrant
the visuals always are and the fact that
“live music and visuals just make so much
sense together.”

VIA is on the cutting edge in a city that
is undoubtedly on the rise. The fourth
year looks poised to top the successes of
years past. If the festival remains on this
trajectory, things are only getting started.

This doesn’t'mean that Pittsburgh is on
its way to having its own South by South-
west — the Austin, Texas-based music
and arts festival that has in recent years
become a city-sprawling event that draws
in visitors by the thousands. Instead, VIA
looks to continue to grow as a festival that
ﬁts the needs of the city’s arts scene, work-
ing with associated groups to create an
event that doesn’t aspire to meet anyone
else’s standards. _ ‘

‘‘We would love for our local, national
and international partnerships to grow
in an organic way that not only brings
larger success to the festival, but also to
Pittsburgh as a creative destination. .It’s
not our vision to become a massive fes-
tival like South by Southwest, because
something that size might not be the best
ﬁt for Pittsburgh.” Goshinski said. “Still,
there is deﬁnitely a lot of room for us to
grow and shift.”

“We are interested in building our own
model with local organizations and creat-
ing an experience that cannot be acarbon
copy of or explained in terms of what other
festivals do or have done,” she said. E

Win or lose,

a season still
a massive
success

Nate Barnes
Sp0rz‘s.Edz'2f0r

Playoff baseball returns to Pittsburgh
tonight, when the Pirates play the Cin-
cinnati Reds in a one—game wild card
playoff. The winner of the game moves
on to play the St. Louis Cardinals in the
five-game National League Divisional
Series. _

Win or lose, though, this 2013 Pirates
season is a success.

Not just because the Pirates broke
their infamous 20-season losing streak,
but more because the Pirates won 94

games this season and are set up for
success in the coming seasons after Neal
Huntington’s sixth season as the team’s
general manager.

The Pirates’ sights entering the sea-
son were set beyond simply winning
82 games. After all, winning 82 games
makes a team nothing much beyond av-

‘ erage in Major League Baseball.

Instead, Pittsburgh aspired to win
the National League Central Division
and advance into the playoffs. The team
didn’t win the division, but its 94-68
record landed them with a home game in
the wild card round against Cincinnati.

Pittsburgh ﬁnished the season with
a three-game sweep of its final regular-
season series in Cincinnati to guarantee
playoffbaseball would be played at PNC

Pitt alumni Fitzgerald, Revis battle in week 4

Revis held Fitzgerald to 68 yards on nine targets, but Fitz had the last laugh with his game-tying touchdown. MCT Campus

Two of Pitt’s best players since the turn
ofthe millennium collided on the pro-
fessional gridiron in week four of the
NFL season.

Tampa Bay’s Darrelle Revis (Pitt '
2004-2006) — considered one of the
best corners in the game — had to take
on one ofthe league’s best wide receiv-
ers in Arizona’s Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt
2002-2003). The battle between the two
former first—round picks was a deadlock
through the first 57 minutes of Sunday’s
contest, but one Pitt alumnus came out

on top.

With 3:06 remaining in the ﬁnal
quarter, Fitzgerald escaped “Revis Is-
land”-— the term given to whomever
Revis covers on any particular day, due
to Revis’ ability to isolate a player from
the field — and slipped behind the de-
fense on a crisp post pattern in the end
zone. Fitzgerald caught a 13-yard touch-
down pass from quarterback Carson
Palmer to tie the game up at 10.

Fitzgerald’s Cardinals rode that mo-
mentum to soar past the Buccaneers,
13-10, on a late field goal by Arizona
kickerjay Feely.

Revis,_ had some success against

Fitzgerald early in the game with a
team—high six solo tackles and a pass
defended. He held Fitzgerald —— who
has yet to eclipse the 100—yard plateau
this season — to only 68 yards on nine
targets.

The two played very physical foot-
ball: Revis battled for a pass intended
for Fitzgerald and came down with an
interception late in the third quarter.
Fitzgerald added a tackle to his box
score when he took down Revis after
the pick.

Fitzgerald hopes to string together

PIRATES

Park. Tonight, Francisco Liriano faces
Johnny Cueto in what will be the ﬁnal
game of the season for one of the two
teams.

Liriano finished his season after
starting late when he broke his right
arm over the Christmas holidays in
2012. The injury followed his signing

by the Pirates to a two-year deal worth

almost $13 million.
The move brought back shades of
haunted days when the Pirates traded

“ valuable minor-league assets for Matt

Morris in July 2007. Morris made ﬁve
starts, going 0-4 with a 9.67 ERA, and
was released April 27, 2008, before re-
tiring three days later.

Morris’ acquisition was the straw
that ﬁnally broke the camel’s back on
then—genera1 manager Dave Littleﬁeld’s
tenure. His departure ultimately result-

piay led the pirates t he mate and in the field. A

  

ed in Huntington’s hire a few months
later.

After Liriano’s injury, Huntington
and the Pirates reworked his deal
for only $1 million guaranteed, with
performance—related incentives and a
team option for 2014. Liriano’s option
was picked up in August, and any doubt
about the signing was erased as Liriano
began pitching.

Liriano made his first start May 12,
and now he ﬁnishes the year with a 16-8

‘record and 3.02 ERA. This is arguably

the best season of his career.

Moves such as this reflect the vision
Huntington had for the Pirates when he
took the general manager position on
Nov. 2, 2007. It’s a vision that guided
the organization’s 12th general manager
to erase in six years the bad feelings
created by the past 20.

him up.  _ 

. '_'.."f “It,l_Qoked like he got down and the guy
just rushed him, hit him while he was slid-
ing, straight head-on-head,” Boyd said. “I
think they should’ve thrown a ﬂag on it.”

The type of hit made by Romero, where
he led with the crown of his helmet, is one
the ‘NCAA has been trying to eliminate
from play this season due to the severe
injuries it can cause.

Evidence in support of this initiative
was on full display Saturday. When head
coach Paul Chryst was asked if this was an
example of the kind of hit the NCAA is try-
ing to eliminate, he said “Yes, I think so.”

But no ﬂag was thrown on the play
when Savage took the helmet—to—helmet
hit, which Chryst said he “thinks” was
the play on which he sustained his con-
cussion. I

“I really believe there is not one official
that isn’t for that,” Chryst said, “I’m going
to stop there.” _

The hit occurred at the end of the third
quarter, and Savage came back onto the
ﬁeld to start the fourth. He was not pulled
from the game until later in the fourth
quarter, after having ﬁnished the drive in
which he took the hit and having played
another series behind center. According
to Borghetti, Savage was removed from

the game as soon as the medical staff be-

came aware of Savage’s concussion-like
symptoms. ‘ .

Savage completed his next three pass-
ing attempts after the hit from Romero: a
17-yard pass to Rachid Ibrahim, a 32-yard
completion to receiver Devin Street and
a 5-yard toss to Kevin Weatherspoon. On
that series, Savage was sacked.

Pitt punted and took back possession
just more than a minute and a half later, at
which point Savage threw an incomplete
pass to Isaac Bennett. Maurice Canady
then sacked Savage on third-and—11 for a
nine-yard loss, the seventh sack Virginia
levied on Pitt’s quarterback. ,

By the time Pitt started its ﬁnal drive
of the game with 3:30 left to play, Chryst
had decided that Savage’s day was done.

“[Savage] went and saw everyone, and
we felt it was best to go with Chad [Voy-
tik],” Chryst said.

During the eight plays he was on the
ﬁeld following the hit from Romero, Sav-
age’s teammates noticed something was
not right in the huddle. Boyd described
him as “wavy.”

“He kept looking drowsy, like he wasn’t
right,” Boyd said. “He said he was cool,
but I knew there was something that was
bothering him.” ’

In the huddle, Street also said Savage
was gagging. V

“He was a little dazed and confused,”
Street said. “He wasn’t OK. I think he got
his bell rung for sure.” ﬂ

town for minor-leaguers wer‘en’t popu-
lar, but Charlie Morton — acquired in
the McLouth deal -— will start playoff
games for the Pirates if they advance
past the wild card.

In the draft, Huntington flooded
the minor league system with talent
by picking big-‘time talent in the first
rounds as well as aggressive spending

in the middle rounds. Plus, the Pirates
finally stopped ignoring the Latin‘
American sector and expanded their
international free—agent budget while
building a baseball academy in the Do-
minican Republic.

The steps were small and painful at
first, but the strides are growing larger
and more impactful. Center ﬁelder An-
drew McCutchen»is the favorite for the
league’s Most Valuable Player award,
and 2011 No. 1-overall choice Gerrit
Cole made his debut this season.

Jameson Taillon, Gregory Polanco

and other top-ranked prospects are on 

the way, and they represent another
step as the Pirates are no longer re-
building, but adding on to what seems
like a playoff contender of a team.

The wild card game today is one step.
It could be a step toward a deep playoff
run, maybe even a World Series title.

If it isn’t, though,this season is not a
failure. In fact, it’s the most meaningful
year of baseball Pittsburgh has seen in
two decades. B

consecutive wins next week when his
Cardinals take on the Panthers, who are
fresh off a bye week. Meanwhile, Revis
and the Buccaneers are heading into
their bye week winless so far in 2013.

' A few other former Panthers made‘

news on the professional level this week.

LeSean McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008) con-
tinues to lead the league in rushing after
his 73-yard performance on 16 carries
against the Broncos. McCoy now has 395
yards this season, nearly 100 yards more
than second-place rusher Doug Martin.

McCoy also had a 21-yard reception
Sunday, but his Eagles fell to Denver in
a rout, 52-20.

Jon Baldwin (Pitt 2008-2010) made
his first catch as a San Francisco 49er
last Thursday night. The former first-
round pick saw a decent amount of ac-

_ tion after being traded from Kansas City

in the offseason. He had two catches for
19 yards in a 35-11 victory over the Rams.

Baldwin’s teammate Andy Lee (Pitt

2000-2004) punted the football effec-

tively in week four. Although the 49ers
managed to tally 35 points of offense,
Lee punted the ball seven times for an
average of 54.7 yards.

Two punts fell inside the opponent’s
20-yard line, and his longest of the eve-
ning sailed for 60 yards.

Giants fullback Henry Hynoski
(2007-2010), who fractured his shoul-
der in week three, was placed on the
injured reserve list last Wednesday,
effectively putting an end to his 2013
campaign.
