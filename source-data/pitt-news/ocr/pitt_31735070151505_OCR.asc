Bennett becomes mentor in comn1ittee of running backs

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

Alone in the backﬁeld just past the 50,
Isaac Bennett takes a direct snap from the
center and darts right, breaking through
ﬁve defenders on the outside. After side-
stepping a ﬂailing would—be tackler,
Bennett bursts through arm tackles and
cruises into the end zone unscathed.

This display of dominance, this se-
quence of precisely-cutting jukes and

powerfully—churning legs, occurs in Okla-
homa’s 2010 Class 5A high school football
state title match — a 32-3 crushing of
East Central High School at the hands of
Booker T. Washington and its star running
back. On the day, Bennett accumulated
three touchdowns and over 220 yards of
total offense.

Bennett’s career at Pitt began as a
three-star recruit in 2011. Since then,
his time has been spent as a backup, hav-

ing started just two games his freshman
year after Ray Graham suffereda right
knee injury.

Bennett, now a junior, has yet to
double such a robust output from that
single title game in his first two years as a
Panther. But when Rushel Shell forfeited
a gig as Pitt’s feature back in 2013 by waf-
ﬂing on transfer options, the role ﬁnally
looked like Bennett’s to lose at the outset
of the season.

His mettle and perseverance are re-
freshing in an era where student-athletes
do not hesitate to ﬂee to another program
in search of guaranteed playtime.

Thus, this was supposed to be a story
about Bennett nearing a rise from his
football nadir, emerging as the every-
down back and squashing vapid scouting
reports.

Season ticket sales swell as Pitt prepares to launch ACC campaign

Brett Sholtis
For The Pitt News V

Panthers football fans who haven’t pur-
chased season tickets are almost out of luck.

During a year of transitions for Pitt
football — including a change from the

Big East Conference to the Atlantic Coast .

Conference — season tickets are disappear-
ing quicker than they have in recent years.
According ‘to Justin Acierno, the assis-
tant athletic director for ticket sales and
operations, the ticketing ofﬁce has sold 90
percent of season tickets for Heinz Field,
which seats more than 65,000 people". This
season’s are some of the best ticket sales
ﬁgures he’s ever seen during his time work-
ing with the athletic department.
Acierno, a Pitt graduate and former
Pitt football player, said that these sales
ﬁgures are due in part to the sales depart-
ment’s outreach to faculty and staff, UPMC
employees and current and former season
ticket holders. However, he also empha-
sized that the demand for season tickets
has a lot to do with Pitt’s shift to the ACC.
“Fans are excited to see some different
teams come into Heinz Field,” said Acierno.

One of those teams is the Florida State
Seminoles, whom Pitt hasn’t faced since
1983, will play against the Panthers in the
season opener on Sept. 2.

He also said that the large number of
students who have bought season tickets at
the discounted price of $25 would contrib-
ute to the Panthers’ home—ﬁeld advantage.

sports blogging site Phil Steele.
According to Pertner, the Panthers need
to ﬁnd suitable replacements for departed
running backs Ray Graham and Rushel
Shell. While Pertner acknowledged Pitt’s
tough defensive line — standout lineman
Aaron Donald‘ in particular —- he cited the
Panthers’ inexperience and the strength

“Fans are excitedto see some

Field.”

While things are good for Aciemo’s of-
ﬁce, the move to the ACC will likely come
at a cost to the Panthers’ win record, as
well as head football coach Paul Chryst’s
record with Pitt. 1

“The schedule strength has gone up and
could stunt their growth record-wise,” said
Brandon Pertner, an assistant editor for the

and speed of established ACC teams as two
factors that could make winning games’
difﬁcult in 2013. A

But even if the move to the ACC takes,
a toll on the Panthers’ record, it probably
won’t stop fans from showing upto the
games. ’ A -

“When you have the likes of Florida a

State, Miami, Clemson, Virginia Tech and
Notre Dame on future schedules, look for
Pitt, as long as they have a solid program,
to have their best showing attendance—wise,
since they moved into Heinz Field,” he said.

Pertner also said that the switch to a new
conference brings with it the opportunity
for Pitt to extend its recruiting effort along
the eastern seaboard from Bostonto Miami.
This could bolster Pitt’s appeal as a foot-
ball university and could continue to keep
season-ticket sales high for years to come.
And with more big games on the schedule,
collegefootball fans from out of town are
likely to travel to Pittsburgh, and they’re
goingto need places to eat, drink and stay.

Ben Gunter, manager at Jerome’ Bettis’
Grille 36, located near Heinz Field, said
that his sales team has already discussed
the potential impact of Pitt’s move to the
ACC and projects that the restaurant will
do more business during Pitt home games
than it has in previous years.

“We’re anticipating a lot more volume,”
Gunter said. “Therefore, we increase staff
levels, more food, booze —- nothing out of

the ordinary that we wouldn’t do for the

Steelers’ home games.” I

Just do it.

This phrase of blind obedience is
so inextricably associated with Nike
that it can hardly be read without
hearing the empty—gymnasium
echoes of Michael Jordan’s squeaky
sneakers and bouncing basketball.
But it’s also one of the most praised
marketing slogans for its simplic-
ity and impact. After all, it’s the
embodiment of every capitalist’s
dream: consumers who act on their
own terms. .

It’s nobig secret that the nation’s
top corporations are in bed with the
government, so it should be equally
unsurprising that they share notes
when it comes to manufacturing
public consent. But instead of a sub-
conscious nudge to buy expensive
ﬁtness gear,-what we get are empty,
meaningless phrases that tell us to
ignore the deeper complexities of
political issues and jump straight to
submissive action. . g

Of course, there always -has to be
the illusion of real action, because
it’s a necessary precursorto selling
the illusion of an American democ-
racy. Instead of exposing the murky
underbelly of merciless war crimes
and unjust foreign policy, we’re given

a

a clean, less—complicated phrase to
print on a ribbon-shaped bumper
sticker aﬂixed next to the Ford logo:
“Support our troops.”

Really, the phrase couldn’t be
more ﬁtting for a society itching
to apply the “un-American” label
to anyone who unapologetically
criticizes government actions. The
conversation no longer revolves
around the policy itself, but drifts
off into some vacuous side note about
criticizing the soldiers who are just as
caught up inlthe whirlwind of power
as the rest of us.

To put forth a more recent‘ ex-
ample: Have you ever met anyone
who was anti-life? Or anti-choice?
Yet their opposites are the slogans
for the divided political stances on
abortion. The arguments are boiled
down to one-dimensional hyper-
boles, making them completely im-

possible to contradict. The goal of

any political leader is to downplay
complexities and disagreements‘ as
much as possible.

But the problem isn’t that slogans
are inherently insufficient at express-
ing complex ideas. In fact, slogans
likejean-Jacques Rousseau’s “Eat the

Ric ” and Occupy Wall Street’s “We ‘

are the 99 percent” are quite effec-
tive at starting a real conversation
about class struggle. The difference

MCT Campus

Propaganda: Creating the free press illusion

between these slogans and “Support
our troops” is that the latter doesn’t
represent any substantive issue at all.
It’s not a question of whether or not
the public supports the troops, but
rather, whether or not they support
the policies that guide the troops.

It’s a primary example of propa-
ganda, and it prevents those in power
from receiving any opposition from
abetter-informed public. When you
control the conversation, you control
public opinion. But this goes way be-
yond throwing meaningless phrases
into the ring. Part of controlling the
conversation involves controlling
the main source of information for
the public: the press.

The argument that afree press is
the antagonist of federal and corpo-
rate propaganda dissolves when you
realize that ﬁinding for the nation’s
top news sources (The New York
Times, The Washington Post, etc.)
comes from the nation’s top corpo-
rations. Just take a look at the New
York Times homepage and ﬁnd one
ad that isn’t sponsored by a company
on the Fortune 500 list.

Understanding that the infor-
mation you receive goes through a
large, systematic ﬁlter is one thing,
but ﬁnding an alternative, reliable
resource is another altogether. Q

The battle on the line of scrimmage is one

that determines a great deal of outcomes .

in Division I football. But the other the-

ater for the war between Pitt and Florida I

State Mondaynight won’t take place on
the ﬁeld, but in the minds of the Panthers’
coaches and players. - f

In playing its-opener against Florida
State, Pitt faces a Division I opponent

, with a talent levelthat far exceeds that;

of recent openers, such as Youngstown
State, Buffalo, Eastern Michigan and
Ohio. As the challenge rapidly approach-
es, the Panthers have kept track of its
proximity with a clock in their weight
room counting down the seconds until
Pitt takes the ﬁeld.

“As soon as you walk in, [it’s] right
above where you see where our workout
is at the top of the board,” senior middle
linebacker Shane Gordon said. “You no-
tice it, it’s crazy how quick it gets up on
you. I remember when it said 100 days,
and now, it’s here. It’s Monday.”

Here it is. After all the fanfare, the
July 1 celebration on the North Shore and
Athletic Director Steve Pederson’s receipt
of a contract extension before Pitt’s even
played a game in its new conference, it’s
here.

But Bennett participated in just four
days of team summer camp before be-
ing sidelined on Aug. 10 with a right
knee injury.

At practice, he looked ready to play,
dressed in pads and uniform, but the
hefty brace stretching from the middle
of his right thigh to the ankle starkly
indicated otherwise. He tried curbing an
obvious craving to practice by cradling
a football close to his chest in one hand
and clutching the facemask of his helmet
in the other.

And now that it’s here, the Panthers
must become focused on the game, itself,
during each snap. Head coach Paul Chryst
seems conﬁdent in his team. _

“This isn’t the ﬁrst big game that our

guys have played in,” Chryst said. “Some

of the younger guys have to learn it, but
I think our guys will be ﬁne.”

If the Panthers want this season to ‘at
least begin differently, if not differ overall

“There are so many different factors.
Who are you as a team? Who is your oppo-

Pitt may not be as fast as Florida State,

and touted recruits, but a focus tailored

to football in the vein of the Pirates’ “one .

When Woodland Hills and Clairton football
players choose Pitt, they have a built-in advan-
tage —— there are several Wolverines and Bears
already playing for the Panthers.

“When you ﬁrst get to a new school, you
want to know somebody,” redshirt sophomore
linebacker Ejuan Price said. “When I came to
a new team, I already had two great friends.”

Price, a member of the 2011 recruitingclass — -
who originally committed to Ohio State, came .

to Pitt afew days laterthan mostfreshmen, but

_ it wasn’t a problem for him because redshirt ‘
sophomore comerback Lafayette Pitts and 1
junior defensive tackle Khaynin Mosley-Smith _

— also 2011 recruits — were there to show
him around. _ I

Pitts, along with Price and Mosley-Smith,
would show former high school teammates
around the next year, too, when Pitts’ cousin,
redshirt freshman safety _]evontevPitts and

redshirt freshman linebacker Mike Caprara

arrived at Pitt. »
“It’s nice having all of my brothers fro
Woodland Hills here,” jevonte Pitts said.

“When we were in high school, it was like a .

brotherhood, and when we came here, itwas

' the same thing.”

Jevonte Pitts spent 2011 at Milford Acad-

' emy—-aNewBerlin,NM,preparatoryschool.

When he came to Pitt the following season, he
wasbehind the rest of the 2011 recruiting class,
despite being the same age;

“I didn’t know_anybody when I came here,
but I knew Mike, Lafayette and_]uan,”Jevonte
said. “Then they knew older guys, and I could

get into the groove with them. It’s probably
harderfor other guysbecause they don’t know
anybody.” .

The freshman safety and Lafayette Pi
work together on and off the ﬁeld to make
each other better players.

“We learn to play off of each other,” Lafay-
ette Pitts said. “We’re in our playbooks togeth-

er. We help each otherwhen there’s something A

Foras beneﬁcial as each ofthe former Wol-

' verines thinks it is having high school team-

mates at Pitt with them, it’s hard to believe it
almost never came to fruition.

I Bothjevonte Pitts and Caprarawere offered
scholarships late in the recruitingseason. La-
fayette Pitts chose the Panthers on signing day
after having shown serious interest -in Rutgers.

“Itwas abig question markwhere everyone
was goingto end up,” Caprara said. “It just kind
of came together in God’s work. It’s pretty neat
because it wasn’t plarmed.”_ '

While the Woodland Hills teammates took
different paths to Pitt, the trio of Clairton fresh-
men —- 'I‘yler Boyd, Terrish Webb and Titus
Howard —— always talked about playing college
football together.

Clairton, which is located a few miles out-

and the longest current winning streak in the

For Boyd, attemptingto carry this success
to the next level with his high school team-

discussing a possible starting role.
When asked if he thought he’d re-

exhaling and ﬂashing a smile —— as if
the feeling had just set in. “But I came
in working hardand hoping it would

Get him talking about his off—ﬁeld
relationship with Bennett and the other

backs, though, and Ibrahim’s soft voice ‘
sheds some of its youthful nervousness. .

“We like to chill a lot. We go out to eat

he said, citing a group hibachi meal at
Nakama.

In other words, Bennett hasn’t been
sulking his injury or his falling stock.
Nor has he lamented Conner orvlbrahim
for moving into the spotlight. Instead,
he’s adopted the role of mentor.

He’s declined to speak to the media
since his injury; but his beaming per-
sonality —_ even while watching practice
from the sidelines —.— and praise from
his teammates both say plenty.

“Oh, he’s a great help,” Ibrahim start-
ed, not knowing where to begin on Ben-
nett’s tutelage. “He’s just like an older
brother. He’s been guiding us, always

camp as a defensive end lastjune. This was
no surprise, as Conner ﬁnished his 2011
high school season with 17 sacks — good
enough to earn All—State honors.

, Nevertheless, the freshman from Mc-
Dowell High School wrapped up his ﬁrst
Pitt training camp over the weekend as the
ﬁrst-team favorite at running back. With
the status of Isaac Bennett in question for
Monday’s opener, Conner expects to start
against Florida State. Though Conner sus-
tained a shoulder injury in the scrimmage
that concluded Pitt’s fall camp, Chryst said
he has practiced this week and that all
signs point to the freshman being ready. ’

Fifth—year senior quarterback Tom Sav-
age will start for the team’s home opener

Sept. 2. Other than Savage, the offensive
playing ﬁeld is wide open. Several players
are after the same job as Conner, one of
whom is fellow freshman Rachid Ibrahim.

Ibrahim was expected to play safety

. before camp began. Throughout prac-

tices, however, Ibrahim appeared in the
backﬁeld alongside the second and third
teams.

“We call ourselves thunder and light-

ning, with me and Rachid,” Conner said

of the potential backﬁeld duo.

Checking into camp, Conner was listed
at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds. He’s now
down toga healthier 240 pounds, but would
like to be at 235 pounds.

“Smash-dash, thunder and lightning,
it’s all the same thing. He’s the big bruis-
er, I’m the quick guy hiding behind the
blocks,” said 6-foot~1, 185-pound Ibrahim.

Ibrahim could also potentially be hid-
ing behind the blocks of freshman Dorian

Johnson, who was a ﬁve-star recruit roam-
ing the halls of Belle Vernon High School
just a few months ago. The 6—foot-5,

While all 14 Atlantic Coast Conference
teams are technically ﬁghting for the
same prize, it’s apparent that each is set
on different goals.

Newcomers Pittsburgh and Syracuse
will look to make an impression on their
new conference foes, while Maryland
is trying to remain relevant in its swan
song. ‘

Florida State and Clemson have na-
tional-title aspirations and the talent
to make it happen. Along with battling
each other, both schools go on the road
in the ﬁnal game of the season to take on
their in-state SEC rivals. Miami, Virginia
Tech and North Carolina are positioned
in the league’s second tier, but any cracks
in Clemson or Florida State could allow
either of them to earn the league’s Bowl
Championship Series bid in the ﬁnal year
of the BCS system.

It will be an intriguing year in the ACC

August 80, 2018 I The Pitt News | wvwv,pitinevvs.com

ACC teams have eyes set on accomplishing individual goals

with new coaches, new teams and old
rivalries. Come 2014, Louisville will be
on its way and so will a college football
playoff.

Here’s my pre—season ACC Break-
down:

Clemson

Senior quarterback Tajh Boyd will lead
the Tigers into 2013 as the favorite to
win the Atlantic Coast Conference. After
throwing for 36 touchdowns and just
under 3,900 yards in 2012, Boyd is also a
Heisman front-runner. Boyd still throws
to junior wide receiver Sammy Watkins,
who had 57 receptions for 708 yards in
2012 despite missing three games.

Miami

After serving a self—imposed bowl ban
in 2012, the Hurricanes appear to ﬁnally
be back on track in 2013. With 19 starters
returning, Head Coach Al Golden’s team
is tied for the most returning starters
in the nation. Last season’s ACC Rookie
of the Year, Duke Johnson, will look to
follow up his 947 rushing yards and 10

touchdowns. The Hurricanes have their
whole offensive line back, so expecta—
tions will be high in Coral Gables, Fla.,
forjohnson.

Florida State

The Seminoles saw 12 starters leave
the program after 2012, and those players
weren’t slouches — 11 of them were taken
in the 2013 NFL Draft. Despite all of the
talent lost, Florida State has a wealth of
talent ready to play after signing a top-
10 recruiting class each of the past four
years. Redshirt freshman Jameis Win-
stoniassumes the quarterback position
in 2013 and has all the talent to guide
the Seminoles.

North Carolina

Larry Fedora has quickly righted the V

ship in Chapel Hill after being forced to
sit out of a bowl game last year. The Tar
Heels’ senior quarterback, Bryn Renner,
is probably the best player you’ve never
heard of. He threw for just shy of 3,400
yards in 2012 with 28 touchdowns and
only seven interceptions.

Virginia Tech
Other than Boyd, the Hokies bring the
most experienced quarterback into the
season in senior Logan Thomas, who re-
gressed last season by throwing one less
touchdown and six more interceptions in
2012 than he did in 2011. Frank Beamer
will need Thomas to lead an offense that
only returns four starters -— the lowest
in the ACC.
Georgia Tech
The Yellow Jackets, a triple-option
team, have a talented offensive line re-
turning, and they didn’t struggle to run
theball last year — Georgia Tech ﬁnished
fourth nationally last year with 311.2
yards per game on the ground. Defensive
endjeremiah Attaochu and safetyjemea
Thomas will lead the way for a Yellow
Jackets defense that struggled in 2012.
Pittsburgh
We’ll know much more about the
Panthers after week one. just hanging

with Florida State could say a lot about
Paul Chryst’s team. For now, Pitt has a
talented defense led by all—everything
defensive tackle Aaron Donald and an
underrated secondary. If the Panthers
can ﬁnd a way to score some points, they
could be a dark—horse candidate in the
Coastal Division.

Wake Forest

The Demon Deacons have 16 starters
returning — eight on offense and eight on
defense. Quarterback Tanner Price had a
disappointing 2012 throwing for over 700
yards less, eight less touchdowns and one
more interception than he did in 2011.
He’ll be surrounded by underrated skill
players, including running backjosh Har-
ris and Michael Campanaro, who should
help Price and the Demon Deacons get
back on track.

North Carolina State

Some predictions have the Wolf Pack
as a top-halfACC team, but I just don’t see
it. North Carolina State returns only 11

starters — second worst, with only FSU
trailing. With a new quarterback, head
coach and three new offensive linemen,
I don’t see the Wolf Pack moving the ball.
But if the new offensive line can play well,
running back Shadrach Thornton could
pick up where he left off in 2012, when
he rushed for 694 yards.

Syracuse .

The other newcomer to the ACC will
be breaking in a new coach in Scott Sha-
fer, the former defensive coordinator
for the Orange. After getting his alma
mater to trend upwards, former Head
Coach Doug Marrone left Syracuse for
the NFL’s Buffalo Bills. Shafer will attempt
to keep that trend going up, but it’ll be
tough offensively, as the Orange lost their
quarterback and top-two wide receivers.

Maryland

Don’t expect the Terrapins to make
much noise in their ﬁnal season in the
ACC. Maryland went through _an unheard
rash of quarterback injuries in 2012, but
I don’t see a healthy C.J. Brown being
enough to lead the Terrapins much higher
than a fourth-place ﬁnish in the Atlantic
Division at best. No matter the quarter-

Virginia
‘It’ll be a fresh start in Charlottesville
as head coach Mike London has brought
in a new coordinator for each side of the
ball. Offensively, both quarterbacks who
saw time in 2012 decided to transfer. The
Cavaliers also have one of the toughest
starts to the season, as they host Brigham
Young and Oregon in the ﬁrst two weeks.
Boston College _
New coach Steve Addazio is looking at
a pretty bare cupboard in Boston. He’ll
attempt to turn a decent quarterback
in senior Chase Rettig into one of the
ACC’s best, but Rettig will need help from
his skill positions. Expect the Eagles to
struggle in Addazio’s ﬁrst season.
Duke C
After going 6-6 and earning a bowl
game for the ﬁrst time in 17 years, the
Blue Devils probably Won’t follow up on
that success too much. With quarterback
Sean Renfree and his top-two wide re-
ceivers long gone, Duke fans should al-
ready start looking forward to basketball.

the season behind junior T.J. Clemmings.

“Our plan right now is to keep Dorian
in the two—deep and prepare him to play,”
said offensive line coach Jim Hueber.

Hueber insisted that Johnson did not
lose a starting spot, but that Clemmings
could not be passed up. He also hinted at
the possibility of Johnson redshirting his
ﬁrst season as a Panther.

“If we get far enough i_nto the season
and he hasn’t played a [signiﬁcant number
of snaps], where you’re putting him into
the game for real, where he’s gotta take
somebody’s place, then we’ll have to make
a decision if we can make it with three tack-
les for the rest of the year,” Hueber said.

Tyler Boyd could be the most highly
touted athlete from Pitt’s 2013 recruiting
class. Hailing from Clairton High School,
Boyd has also taken a slight turn from his
original plans.

' Injanuary, Boyd was reportedly told by

got in the value of [wide receivers] Coach
[Bobby] Engram coaching him day-in and
day—out.”

The improvement Chryst discusses is
what could very well turn Pitt’s No. 1 receiver
into a ﬁrst—round pick, and an NFL team’s
starter at the position in the near—future.
While Jonathan Baldwin left Pitt early for
the pro ranks, his decision proved a blessing
in disguise for the development of Street.

Two years later, after Baldwin was se-
lected in the ﬁrst round by the Kansas City
Chiefs, he want on to total just 41 receptions
for 579 yards. On the other side, Street is on
the verge of becoming nationally renowned.

NFLDraftScout.com ranks street as the
No. 9 receiver in the 2014 NFL Draft and
player No. 138 overall, which would project
him as about a fourth-round selection. But a
big year this season is what could push him
to ﬁrst-round status.-

And this season is exactly what Street
is focused on, especially when leading the
offense.

Offensively, after Pitt lost 3,000-yard
passer Tino Sunseri (who ever thought peo-
ple would talk about losing Tino?), 1000-
yard rusher Ray Graham and Street’s mate
on the outside, Mike Shanahan, who regis-
tered over 900 receiving yards last season,
Pitt’s offensive fortunes may not be tied to

ler Boyd, who will start with Street at the
receiver position Monday, Street’s done a
pretty good job so far.

“I.know that he respects me as a team-
mate, on the ﬁeld and off the ﬁeld,” Boyd
said. “I’ve been waiting since I got here to get
all of my tips off him. He’s a role model and a

  Tyler Boyd

another player more closely than they are
to Street.

“Obviously, Devin is a very good player,”
Chryst said. “Certainly he is going to be one
of those guys we need to play at a high level
and lead at a high level.”

From the perspective of freshman Ty- V

leader to me right now, so I’m thankful for it.”

Boyd should be thankful, as he’s playing
behind the player who will become Pitt’s
al1—time leader in receptions possibly by
the end of the season’s ﬁrst month. Street
only needs 28 more, and averaged nearly six
catches per game last season — a number

that should improve again this year, just
as it has between each one of his previous
three seasons.

While Pitt brings little production in
behind Street, the wide receiver has high
expectations for what the receiving corps
can do this season despite losing Shanahan
and Cam Saddler to graduation and Ronald
Jones to suspension.

“I want us to be the core of that offense,”
Street said. “I want us to be the main focus,
and getting guys going. Guys can watch
us going 100 percent, and that motivates
them.” _

Street is apparently a focus point for the
Seminoles as they prepare to visit the pan-
thers at Heinz Field Monday. At the very
least, he is a main focus for FSU defensive
back Karlos Williams, who said Street is “not
a great receiver.”

What Williams, or anyone else, has to say
about Street likely goes in one ear and out
the other. If Street remembers anything, it’ll
be what he does on Monday.

As Pitt begins a new era in program his-
tory, it has a nice piece to start with to lead
the program through its ﬁrst year, while
leaving an impact on players like Boyd.

The 2013 season will be a historic one for '

the Pittsburgh Panthers, as it marks the ﬁrst
year of their membership in the Atlantic
Coast Conference. While the realignment
has forced the cancellation of rivalry games
like the Backyard Brawl, Pitt’s ACC member-
ship has allowed the school to renew old
rivalries with former Big East foes, such as
Boston College and Virginia Tech. The 2013
squad will also continue historic rivalries
with teams like Syracuse and Notre Dame,
while creating new rivalries with schools
like Florida State, Miami and'Wake Forrest.
Here’s the entire Pitt schedule, complete
with predictions of each game’s outcome:
Game 1 —-— versus Florida State, Sept. 2
The revamped Panthers offense will
struggle against new FSU Defensive Co—
ordinatorjeremy Pruitt’s defense, but the
Panthers defense should keep them in
the game late into the fourth quarter. The

Panthers, allowing Florida State to put the
game away for good in the middle of th
fourth quarter. '
Prediction: FSU 31, Pitt 17
Game 2 — versus New Mexico, Sept. 14
New Mexico, led by impact tailback
Kasey Carrier and dual—threat quarterback
Cole Gautsche, will strike for one or.two big
plays, but the leaders of the.Panthers will
not allow the Lobos to duplicate last year’s
upset at the hands of Youngstown State.
Quarterback Tom Savage will throw for a
few touchdowns, and the Panthers defense
will force a few turnovers, enabling Pitt to
cruise to their ﬁrst victory of the season.
Prediction:'Pitt 35, New Mexico 14
Game 3 —— at Duke, Sept. 21
Junior quarterback Anthony Boone will
not be able to ﬁgure out the tough Panthers

defense led by defensive tackle Aaron Don- .

ald. As a result, the Panthers will dominate
the Blue Devils, picking up the second vic-
tory of the season and the program’s ﬁrst

Prediction: Pitt 28, Duke 10
Game,4 — versus_Virginia, Sept. 28
Both teams’ defenses will dominate
this game, but the Pitt offense will do just

enough to allow the Panthers to win. Look ’
-for freshman Tyler Boyd to make a big im-

pact in this one while he participates in his
ﬁrst Homecoming game.

Game 5 — at Virginia Tech, Oct. 12,

Game 6 — versus Old Dominion, Oct. 19

Quarterback Taylor Heinicke will pro-
pel the Monarchs to a fast start, but the

Panthers offense will respond with four ’

touchdowns. In the end, the Pitt running
game will be just a little too much for the Old

Prediction: Pitt 28, Old Dominion 24
Game 7 — at Navy, Oct. 26

Navy’s version of the mythical option
offense, the ﬂexbone, willhave success
initially, but eventually’ Matt House and
company will ﬁgure out a way to stop the
Midshipmen offense withtthe speed of the
Panthers’ linebacking corps. Look for Tyler

a subpar Navy defense.

‘ Game 8 — at Georgia Tech, Nov. 

Georgia Tech ,is one ofthe top teams
in the Coastal Division, and will prove it
against the Panthers. Quarterback Vad Lee
willhrun the triple option extremely effec-
tively against the Panthers’ defense, forcing

the. offense to step up. While Savage and _
company will have an opportunity to lead '

the Panthers to the upset, the Yellowjacket
defense, in tandem with ﬂawless execution

me that with Chryst, Pitt had avery good staff
coming in, and I took it into consideration.”

Now that they’re all Panthers, the former
Clairton players are competing all over the
practice ﬁeld. Webb, Howard and Coles are all
inthe secondary competing for playing time.
They also complement each other well because
they’ve played together for so long.

“Since we know each other so well, we can
play fast,” Coles said. “We’re used to playing
with each other, ‘so’ it’s easier.” .

They also know when their teammates
need to be picked up. _

' “Playingwith them so long, they know your
emotions,” Webb said. “If you’re down, they’re
pushing you and keeping you up.”

Although they’re in blue and gold now, the

, former Bears still feel-at home.

“It feels like the same thing. Just likewe’re

about to play for the Clairton Bears,” Boyd
said. “They showed us everything it took to
winchampionships. Now,we’re still following
them here.” I .

Despite Clairtorfs unprecedented success

inPennsylvaniahigl1 school football, the play-
ers still receive some skepticism because of
theiropponents’ talent level at the state’s lowest
classiﬁcation — Class A —— which is reserved
for the smallest high schools.

“Once you get here, they always talkabout,
‘You came from aSingle-A school,”’ Coles said.
“We use that to push ourselves and make plays.
We want to beat them out because they think
because we’re from a smaller school, we can’t
compete.” l

Jevonte, who played in Pennsylvania’s high-
est classiﬁcation, Class AAAA, at Woodland
Hills, doesn’t look down upon his Clairton
teammates. _ '

“I grew up in Duquesne, so I’ve seen all of
the Single—A players,” he said. “Talent—wise,
those Clairton players can atch up with
anybody.” I‘ ‘

Perhaps the Pit football team can use a
little bit of the winning ways that the Clairton
freshmen bring, as the trio carries a 63-game ‘
win streak into the program from their time I
togetherinhighschool. (

“Even though we’re out of Clairton, we’re
tryingto make itto 64andjust keep going and
going,” Webb said. “That’s what we’re looking
forward to.” I

by the offense, will prove to be too much for
the Panthers to handle.

Prediction: Georgia Tech 31, Pitt 23
Game 9 — versus Notre Dame, Nov. 9

This game will certainly be circled on the
calendar inside the Panthers locker room
and on the schedules stuck to nearly every
Pitt fans’ wall. Last season, Pitt had mul-
tiple opportunities to play spoiler against
the undefeated Irish in South Bend, Ind.
The Panthers will be hungry for the upset
early on, but the Irish, led by replacement
quarterback Tommy Rees, will be too much
for them. ' l _

Prediction: Notre Dame 38, Pitt 20
"Game 10 —— versus UNC, Nov. 16

Tom Savage will look to lean heavily on
a running game established early on. Isaac
Bennett and James Conner will help the
Panthers pull off the upset of the Tar Heels.

Prediction: Pitt 16, UNC 14

Game 11 — at Syracuse, Nov. 23

The revamped Syracuse offense will

a

struggle mightily against one of the better I

defenses in the ACC. As a result, the Pan-
thers will dominate the Orange and exact
revenge for last season’s tough loss.
' Prediction: Pitt 31, Syracuse 14.
Game 12 — versus Miami, Nov. 29 ’
"Even though the Hurricanes are facing
NCAA sanctions, they are poised for a huge
season. The “U” will be hungry when they
invade Heinz Field, because the team will

4 be eligible for an ACC Coastal crown for the

ﬁrst time inlyears. With a win propelling
the Hurricanes to the title, Miami will beat
the Panthers.

Prediction: Miami 35, Pitt 19

When the season’s over, Paul Chryst and
company will be able to look back on the
season’s accomplishments with pride. The
7-5 season will be highlighted by four con-
ference victories, including a home upset
over North Carolina. The performance will
place the Panthers in afourth-place tie" with
the aforementioned Tar Heels. With the
tiebreaker favoringcthem, the Panthers will
face the American East Conference in the
Belk Bowl in Charlotte, N.C. The Belk Bowl
appearance will mark the ﬁrst time in four
years that the Panthers will not be playing
a bowl game in Birmingham, Ala. I

PECYNA

John Buck on Tuesday, is Patrick Star.

It’s almost as though Huntington knew
football season — college and.professional
—— was closing in, a time when Pittsburgh
is used to tuning out the Pirates. Since both
the Panthers and Steelers could realistically
struggle at their respective levels, Huntington
saw a moment to hush the clamoring of how
to avoid this doomed reality.

In the cartoon, Sandy Cheeks steps for-
ward and decides to stop the bull worm head-
on, her brass met with immediate crowd ap-
proval and support.

“Go get ’em, Sandy! We have the utmost
conﬁdence in you,” Mr. Krabs says, his opti-
mism seemingly bounding.

Once she leaves, though, Mr. Krabs turns
directly to Patrick and asks, “Now what was
that idea of yours?” The next scene shows the
creatures pushing the town.

Huntington’s trade was stupid, but it was '

something he had to do. Pittsburgh has been

abysmal in right ﬁeld: Pirates stationed there
have posted a lower collective on—base plus
slugging percentage (.686)'than that of any
team in the National League. So with fewer
than 30 games remaining on the schedule
and the Pirates trailing St. Louis for ﬁrst
place by a slim margin, Huntington had to
do something to upgrade the productivity
at that position.

Byrd is anupgrade, albeit under the condi-
tion that this is the best professional season
of his life. He’s been worth four wins above
replacement-level players, by Baseball—Ref—

erence.com’s numbers, and his .852 OPS is

the fourth highest among all right ﬁelders. ‘

His only other similarly successﬁll season
was in 2008, when he played for the Rangers
in a hitter—friend1y home park.

But Byrd is thriving at age 36, and is by
no means anything other than a stopgap un-
til prized prospect Gregory Polanco, who is
currently mashing at Double—A, is ready —
presumably by sometime next year.

Buck, 33, is nothing but extra catching
depth for the Pirates’ late—season games. He’s
insurance if Russell Martin or Tony Sanchez
suffers an injury.

Now here is why it’s a poor trade.

The Pirates gave second baseman Dilson
Herrera and reliever Vic Black in exchange for
the two former Mets and $250,000.

Herrera, 19, has held his own in a league ’

where most players are older than him, all
while playing a premium offensive position.

- He’s about the 10th best prospect in the Pi-

rates’ farm system, but the organization has
depth at second base in guys likejordy Mercer

_ and Alen Hanson.

Black, meanwhile, has seen limited time in
Pittsburgh this year as a low—leverage reliever.
His upside, however, is that of a dominant
late-inning, back-of—the-’pen pitcher, featur-
ing high—90s heat and pure strikeout stuff.

Though neither player projects to become
a perennial all-star, Herrera and Black have
a great shot at becoming productive major
leaguers. Black is ultimately a reliever and
Herrera is far from the bigs.

The Pirates need wins now, so they paid a
fairly steep price for a 36-year-old in the late
stages of a career year and a backup catcher.
Both players are upgrades in the present,

v but provide no value beyond the next couple

months. .
It’s a dumb trade in the abstract, but it’s

one that helps Pittsburgh immediately — if ~
for no other reason than that it might keep '

the Pirates relevant later into the fall and ease
the stress of a futile football year.
The transactionwas dumb enough that it

i just might work, kind of like pushing Bikini

Bottom away from the bull worm’s path of
destruction. ‘

In the Spongebob episode, Sandy and
Spongebob evade the worm, leading it to
fall off _a cliff —~ right to where the town was
pushed. Whether or not a moribund football
season still falls as heavily as usual on the city

‘of Pittsburgh, though, willbe determined

by the success of Huntington’s questionably
brilliant plan. I .

kickers come from similar backgrounds. In
high school, both players started off playing
soccer, eventually switching to football due
to having friends on the team.

“Going into my freshman year, I played
soccer, so I just said Iwas going to be a kicker
and go out and play football with my friends,”
Blewitt said.

In addition to playing with his friends,
Blewitt also cited that he likes “crushing the
ball more” than he was able to do on the
soccer pitch.

As ﬁrst—year kickers, both players will -

face tougher opponents and the difficulties
of playing under pressure. The pressure gets
no greater this season when Pitt opens its
season at home against No. 11 Florida State
Monday. I - »
As training camp progressed, though,
Chryst found a solution to his kicker ques-
tion as Blewitt emerged as the front—runner
for the Panthers’ starting kicker job. While
Blewitt sustained a minor injury to his kick-
ing foot, Chryst expects him to be ready for
action come game time. ‘
“Right now, I think Chris will beready to

go. If not, we’ll just put out another freshman I

kicker,” Chryst joked. “I’m all for a freshman
kicker.”

Playing at Heinz Field means they will
be playing in front of over 50,000 people,
including the Pitt student section — the
Panther Pitt — which was recently ranked
as the seventh—best student section in the
nation according to ESPN

A crowd can either be a kicker’s best
friend or worst enemy. It only takes one
kick to make or break the crowd’s trust, as
Pitt fans saw time and time again in the era
of Kevin Harper.

Pitt should be in a goodspot with Blewitt,
who said his most pressured kick in high
school was one that didn’t come in the fourth
quarter, or the third, or second.

“It was our home-opener game against
the defending region champs, which is a
pretty big deal in high school. It was going
to be my longest attempt, 51 yards, and it
would break the school record,” Blewitt said.
“I knew what it meant to me. After three
years of kicking, it was all I wanted — that
record —— and sure enough, I made it, and it
was really what decided the game.”

“It was actually the ﬁrst quarter, but we
won by six.” I

coaches that he would receive carries from
the backﬁeld and co—star in wildcat forma-
tions. Boyd has not yet been given reps
from the backﬁeld, but he has worked his
way onto the ﬁrst team at wide receiver,
right behind ﬁfth-year senior Devin Street.
Street spoke highly of Boyd at camp.
“He deﬁnitely has a lot of conﬁdence.
For a freshman to have that much conﬁ-
dence, I think that’s what ups his level of

gameplay. He can go out there and play
fast and I deﬁnitely think he’s going to
be a big asset in our offense,” said Street.

Boyd may be ahead of some people’s
projections, but he knows there is room
for improvement.

“Even on my best routes, I still got
something to ﬁx. If I beat the DB, get a
good cut and get up the ﬁeld, there’s still
something in there I got to ﬁx, so there’s
nothing in there that is [consistently]
great,” said Boyd, who has packed on 15
pounds since committing to Pitt, now up

.=:I.I:|;m\'rI2
..‘l’m\iS|Bl.\'

to 6—foot-2 and 185 pounds.

“I got to get more endurance, stamina,
so I can keep it going through the fourth
quarter,” Boyd added.

Most importantly, Boyd impressed
head coach Paul Chryst enough that he will
line up as a true—freshman starter Monday
next to a player on the verge of becoming
the program’s career receptions leader.

“I’ve learned never to be surprised with
Tyler,” Chryst said. “He sees himself on a
big stage, and he’s going to get that.” 3
