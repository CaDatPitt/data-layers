State Authorizes $21 Million F or Pitt

By SCOT STONE
Pitt News Staff Writer /A
On December l8, ‘Gov. Dick
Thornburgh signed a capital budget
bill that included $21.8 million for
the expansion and renovation of
Pitt’s School of Dental Medicine
and School of Pharmacy, but not ari

‘ expected $15.6 million for a medical

research facility near Scaife Hall.
The entire capital funds bill
included $37l_ million for a wide
variety of projects across the state.
Thom Lamb, the assistant director

of government relations at Pitt, was
_unable to speculate on the reasons
why the research’ facility was denied
funding, but assumed that some of
the projects vetoed by the governor
were inexcess of his previously set
‘spending limit for the whole
package.

The renovation of the dental
facility is a top priority at Pitt
because of its antiquated condition.

“We need the money for the
School of Dental Medicine because
if we didn't renovate, there was the

Brink|ey’s Back For Trial

By SCOT STONE
Pitt News Staff Writer

After receiving three consecutive
life sentences in Philadelphia, Sid-
ney Brinkley was returned to Pitts-
burgh this week to face charges
stemming from the 1979 murder of
Pittvstudent Monica Renee Jones.

In pretrial hearings that began

Monday at the Allegheny County ‘

Court House, Common Pleas Judge
Ralph J. Cappy overruled a defense
motion to close the hearings to the
public. Cappy cited a Supreme
,Court ruling which emphasized the
importance of keeping a trial public
if at all possible. ’

According to John Cook, Brink-
ley’s attorney, the publicity that
would arise from public hearings
could damage his client's chances to
secure an unbiased jury.

“l’ve been assigned to represent
him. I intend to represent himto the

best of my abilities and part of that

function is to see, in attempting to .

get a fairjury, that we do not get any
more pretrial publicity than is abso-
lutely necessary,” Cook said.‘
Cook is also pressing a number of
other motions, one of which is to
select jury members from another
county. According to aspokesmari
from Judge Cappy’s office, the
motions are not frivolous, and are
important in establishing a fair and,

"proper context for the trial. Because

of this, ‘and because of the expected
difficulties in jury selection, the trial
itself may not get started for several
weeks.

Brinkley, a 21-year-old Philadel-
phian and former construction.
worker, was sentenced to three con-
secutive life terms in Philadelphia

The capital funds bill is a
complicated financing measure that
provides money ‘for a variety of
projects outside of the state's general

Draft Sign-Ups

For 19-20 Yr Olds

By SETH LUBOVE

Pitt News Staff'Writer

The Selective Service, facing
numerous court challenges, nation-
wide protests and a number of non-
registrants, began Monday
registering young men for a future
military draft. the second registra-
tion since this summer.

And, according to Selective Ser-
vice officials, this summer’s registra-

tion “proved quite successful“ with a i

95 percent compliance rate, accord-
ing to Selective Service figures.
“Basically, I think that l9- and
20-year-olds are responsible, mature
individuals and they recognize they
have a responsibility to do this, not
just because it’s the law, but _bec_uase
it’s part of being a citizen or living in
this country," said Brayton Harris,
asistant director ofthe Selective Ser-
vice in a telephone interview. ,
There were earlier reports ofskep—
ticism expressed by government
officials regarding the Selective Ser-
vice's figures, but a Dec. 22, 1980
report by the General Accounting
Office, the investigative branch‘ of
the federal government, confirmed
that the registration data was “com-
plete arid accurate,“ Harris said.

Have you ever found yourself
watching the lovable Pitt Panther
more than the football game?
Through humor, gymnastic ability
and pure craziness, John Haines
takes credit for being the enthu-
siastic Pitt Panther.

Haines said he was a cheerleader
last year and with that experience,
decided to try out for the Panther.
At tryouts in mid-April, he was
given three minutes in the Panther
suit and had to show his gymnastic
ability, along with doing lifts with
the female cheerleaders.

He says he loves being the
Panther. ,

“I like football and played it in
high school; I just never wanted to
get away from it,” Haines
commented.

The children are what makes his
job so enjoyable, according to
Haines.

"I love_doing it for the kids. They
come up and put their arms around
me and hug me and say ‘I love you,
Pitt Panther’. I just melt when they
do that,” Haines said.

Haines explained that the
Panther has been around since the
1930's and was originally a Black
fur Panther suit. Today, the suit
resembles a North American
Mountain Lion or Puma. When
Haines steps into the suit, he says
he goes through a complete
personality change.

\_“I’m deﬁnitely more outgoing
and act even crazier than I usually
do,” -Haines said.

Haines said he hopes to be next
year’s Panther and would like to try
to be the best Panther at Pitt. He
said he believes Brian Barth-
olomew, who was Panther from
1978 to 1979 was the best he’s ever
seen. Bartholomew is now an
NCAA Rooster appearing at
Eastern Eight basketball games.
according to Haines.

“I believe with a little more
experience and practice, John
could be the best Panther,” said
Karen Agostinella, Pitt’s cheer-
leading coach. ’

job. According to Agostinella,

and commented that they have
missed some exciting plays be-
cause they were watching the

antics of the Panther. ,
Haines said he never ‘gets out of

character when he becomes the
Panther and claims that it is the
‘game that keeps him going.
“The game is deﬁnitely a big
factor in my performance. I felt the
Florida State game was my best

game, it was so exciting. We were"

behind and I had to pull everybody
together,” Haines said.

Haines practices with the cheer-
leaders three times a week for two
hours each day. He said he does
push ups, runs, does stretching
exercises, lifts, and works on the
mini trampoline. He also works on
routines such as wrestling with a
chair or chasing his tail.

“A big tradition at Pitt was for
the Panther to run into the
goalpost. I did that the first game,
my opening routine and I got yelled
at and told not to do it again. The
reason I got yelled at was because
they just spent $600 to straighten
the_ go_alpost, ’ ’_ Haines /recalled.

The Panther suit lfangs in his
closet and Haines said he has the
responsibility for its care.

“I shampoo and blow dry the
head. The body gets thrown into
the washing machine and then
tumble dried,” Haines said.

According to Haines, A it's a
rigorous job and one must stay in
shape to be the Panther. He said he
lost ten pounds after the Boston
College game, where the temper-
ature was 85 degrees. In the winter
the suit is comfortable but as soon
as it gets wet, he said it gets heavy,
cold and uncomfortable. He said he
skips rope to stay in shape and it is
also one of his favorite hobbies.

' Haines said he wears girdle pads
and knee pads to protect himself
when he tumbles, especially when
he climbs atop three folding chairs.

The most fearful part of the job,‘
according to Haines, is when he

gets “passed up,” lifted and
carried above the heads of the
spectators.

“Alot of people think I’m

indestructible because I’ve got a
helmet on but a Panther’s neck
breaks just as easily as anybody
else’s does,” Haines laughed.

“ A Question
of Fairness‘

‘Monday marked the beginning of a second

move by the Selective Service to register young men”

between the ages of l9 and 20 for a future military
draft.

This most recent call (the first call came this past
summer) was greeted with mixed emotions from the
ranks of draft-age young men. _

lofty penalties that the government threatened to
impose upon those who refused to comply. Others
registered because they believed it their patriotic duty
to do so.

“Basically,_I think that 19- and 20-year olds are

responsible and mature and they recognize that they ‘

have a responsibility to do this notjust because it is law
but because it’s part of being a citizen or living in this
country,” said Brayton Harris, assistant director of the
Selective Service.

But there were some young men (about five percent)
that simply ignored the demands of the Selective Ser~
vice and refused, in any way, to take part in the sign-

registration would surely move us one step "closer to
war. ’ I I

“A lot of people do realize that registration, means
the draft, which means a possible war. I don’t think
that that’s simply rhetoric that people like me throw
around,” said Duane Shank, director ofthe Commit-

.tee Against Draft Registration and the Draft.

“All of the young people that I talked to, both on the
phone and in person, certainly recognize the connec-

The Pitt News solidly stands behind these young

men who have not and will not take part in the Seleg,-.

tive Service registration process, those men who have
made their decisions and have clung to them despite
the penalties that loom in the future.

We wholeheartedly agree that, despite Selective Ser-
vice rhetoric, registration puts our nation on the thre-
shold of what could be a catastrophic war, a war to end
all wars. We cannot condone the use of our generation
as soldiers in such a senseless, no-win conflict.

Harris, said that all young men should ‘register

country. _

But is it not also a part of living in this country _to
have the right to speak and live as one pleases, rights

Journalists recap the top news
stories and events for us at the end of
every year. As‘ I980 came to a close,
each of the three media forms
reminded us of all that had
happened of significance in l980,
and some added a news analysis to
help us interpret the events. Since
The Pit! News didn't publish in late
December. we didn't have the
opportunity to do such a recap, so
here early'in l98l. we thought we'd
take a look back at some of l980‘s
top stories or events.

‘ 1980: The Year

In Review

The election of Ronald Reagan
topped everyone’s list as story ofthe
year. The surprising aspect of that

V event was that either a great number

of people did not make up their

» minds until the last few days or else

they knew all along who they were
going to vote for and just didn't
reveal it publicly. Reagan’s landslide

~ victory was astonishing not only to

the pollsters but to the candidates
and the-people as well. Evidently
Reagan offered some of that same
‘mystique that was so visible with
John Kennedy. The people were

4 A tired of being told that they could no

longer achieve the American Dream
and chose someone who perhaps can

i give them one last shot at prosperity.

  

Much in the minds of the

American people last year was the
' fact that the Iranians were still
‘ holding
“countrymen hostage- lt was a crisis

some_ of A their fellow

that began\433 days ago and has
brought humiliation to this country
as no single event has ever done.
Undoubtedly the crisis as well as the
failed rescue attempt which killed
eight Americans contributed to
Jimmy Carter‘s defeat.

lt was a year of tragedies--caused
by both man and nature. We saw
civil violence return to the street in
Miami and Greensboro, N.C. Over
3000 people died in the major
earthquake which hit southern ltaly,
and here in the United States, Mt.
St. Helens Volcano erupted for the
first time in over a hundred years.
Even though the eruption claimed
several lives and caused millions of
dollars in damage, it also was a
natural event which brought
fascination to scientists and laymen
alike. » '

It was a year that saw thousands
of Cubans ﬂee their native land and
the lifestyle provided there by Fidel
Castro and resettle in this country.
The event also lessened President
Carter‘s popularity as the refugees
came in such large numbers that
they worsened already economic-
ally-deprived areas and added to the
woes oflocal, state. and federal
officials. Not only did Castro send
us refugees, but he returned air
pirates as well as Americans held in
Cubanjails.

Inﬂation continued its ragein the
country as mortgage and interest
rates hit all-time highs.» The once
impeccable American, automobile
industry took a dive as well as a back
seat to the Japanese auto makers.

.Gasoline topped the $l.20 mark.

The year 1980 saw the deaths of
various national and international
celebrities. We said good bye tosuch

greats as Alfred Hitchcock, Steve—

McQueen, Peter Sellers, Colonel

Harlan Sanders, George Raft, and .

Mae West. One of the worst events
of the year was the assassination of
former Beatle John Lennon. He
wanted nothing but peace for the
world, and it is so tragic to have him
die such a violent death.

,Ihe year saw the deaths of world
leaders Josef Tito of Yugoslavia; the
Shah ‘of lran, Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi; and former Russian

premier, Alexi Kosygin. Jean—Paul '

Sartre, Jean Piaget, William, 0.
Douglas, and George Mearw also
died. V

The highlight of the year most
likely was the victory by‘ the

American Olympic hockey team

over theRussian team in last
Winter's Lake Placid Games. The
Americans, had earlier been soundly
beaten by the Russians in apractice
match in New York. The Americans
went on to capture the gold medal.

The pictures sent back to earth
from Saturn by‘ the space craft,
Voyager. held the world captive for
"a week last fall. The pictures
answered some questions about the
distant planet but undoubtedly

raised more than it answered. The -

success of the venture reaffirmed
America‘s dominance in space but at
the same time renewed old questions
about the value of the billions spent
on the space program while the
country stuggles in double-digit

' inﬂation.

‘Panthers End Season NumberTwo



, Willie Collier, Rick Trocano, Carl-

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Sports Editor I
For the senior class of the Pitt
Panthers. Jacksonville was almost
like a homecoming of sorts because
this is where Pitt played when the
likes of Hugh Green, Mark May,

ton Williamson, Ricky Jackson and
Benjie Pryor, just to name a few,
were the untested group offreshman
that coach Jackie Sherrill had hoped
would eventually bring the Panthers
another national championship.

That dream came ever so close to
becoming reality as the Panthers
devastated South Carolina by a
score of 37-9 while Florida State,.
then number two, fell to Oklahoma
18-17 in the Orange Bowl. The
obstacle that proved to be insur-
mountable was the Georgia Bul-
ldogs who completed a 12-0 season
by beating mistake~prone Notre
Dame, l7-10 in the Sugar Bowl.

The‘Gator Bowl was played on
December 29 which meant that Pitt
would not find out where they stood
inthe national ranking untilthe New
Year's games were played three days
later. But after the victory over the
Gamecocks’ in a stadium filled with g
South Carolina supporters, the
Panthers knew in their hearts who
really was number one.

“We beat them (South Carolina) .
bad,” said senior linebacker Mark
Reichard. “I really think that we’re
gonna win it (the national title).”

That was the kind of optimism
that was expressed by most of the
players. Despite thejubilation ofthe
Gator Bowl victory and the beliefin
themselves, there was also a realiza-
tion of the fact that a little luck

37-9 rout of South Carolina in. the Gator ‘Bowl. an ers WI . ac es and ﬁve’ asslstsm Pitts ‘I

would be needed to complete a great
season.

“With the luck of the Irish and if
Oklahoma doesntfumble, 1 think
that we deserve the national title,”
said Greg Meisner, senior defensive
tackle. “If we played Georgia, we’d
destroy them." _

But on New Year’s Day, the
Panthers didn’t have the luck of the

Irish. As a matter o'f fact, not even

Notre Dame had the luck of the.

Irish. Dan Devine’s final coaching
effort ended in a dismal display.
Even though the Irish won the statis-
tical battle in every phase, costly
mistake after costly mistake
deprived Notre Dame of the seven-
point ballgame, as well as ruining
Pitt’s title hopes.

‘ The next important game was the
Orange‘Bowl in a rematch of last
year’s game. Oklahoma had a slight
case of fumbleitis and it was enough
to keep the Seminolestin the game.

Pitt‘s chances for the number two
spot seemed to diminish as the night
grew on until Sooner quarterback J.
C. Watts drove his run-oriented
offense (which averaged 360 yards

per game this season)‘ 79 yards‘

through the air for the touchdown
and two-point conversion which

dropped the Seminoles out of the_

top’ three.
There was a slogan that went
around a few years ago which was

i put out by a majorlcar rental com-

:pany whichsaid something to the
effect that being number two makes

them try harder. In Pitt‘s case,‘ti'me

has run out for trying harderand the

Panthers are number two.

At the beginning of the season, ~

there were many goals that were set
and ‘expected to be attained. The
team won the annual battle for the
Lambert Trophy and Cool Ray Cup
for Eastern supremacy. Individu-

H J-ACKSONVlLLE——Pitt fans who attended ‘the
Gator Bowl in Jacksonville were treated with more
Southern “Unhospitality” than goodwill. Not only'did
the merchants of the Jacksonville area openly show
their support for the South Carolina Gamecocks, but
many were downright rude to “the northerners.”

It wasn’t only the merchants who were rude but also
the Gamecocks fans who, by the way, actually thought
they were going to win the game, were obnoxious.

Now it’s not that the Pitt fans haven’t been
obnoxious at times, and the 10,000 who attended the
Gator Bowl did get obnoxious, but it was all in fun
whereas the Gamecock fans meant it.

Here are a few instances: V
~-While attending a rally thenight before the game,
our group metwith thousandsof South Carolinians
and zero Pittsburghers. This did not discourage our
entourage, however, as we listened to the bluegrass
band. Soon, however, we noticed that all the fans
screaming “Go Cocks Go” also were waving
Confederate flags. Now, when they start bringing out
the ﬂags, you know you’re on the wrong side of the
Mason-Dixon Line. But, who won the war anyway‘?
~ A member ofanother group ofPi<tt fans asked the

‘owner of "a recreational vehicle to use the facilities
inside after a little too much celebrating at the game.
The owner obliged until the girl’s coat blew open and
revealed a blue and gold Pitt shirt. He then‘ became
rude and refused to ‘let her inside...simply because she
was from Pitt.

—That same group was driving home from
Jacksonville and found itselfwith a flat tire at 4 a.m. in
(ofall places) South Carolina. J_ust when theythought
help had arr-ived a South Carolina state ‘trooper
proceeded to shine a light in their faces and ask what
was going on without even offering to help. He then
drove off leaving them‘ stranded without a good spare.
Now that’s southern hospitality.

V ;Back to our group. We were leaving the game all
equipped with Pitt shirts, hats and buttons. One
Gamecock tan saw us and quickly said to one member
of the group, “See y’all back at the factory-...but you

like that under any other condition could have caused
a rumble. T

—Finally, to. end the whole evening ofthe game, the.-I

group was at a local nightclub, Big Daddy‘s, and the
disc jockey was playing the final song of the evening;

attendants and waitresses, gives this Yankee _the..“”
impression that those people still think that the_»Ci“vil ~

War is going on. Not only were the Gamecock fans‘
rude, but they were also fickle. Yes, even more fickle
than we Pittsburghers can sometimes be when the
Panthers are down or when the Steelers lose a game.

South Carolinians began cheers for Georgiajand 0‘ I

mjtgerscomes To Town To Challenge Panthers

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Pitt News Sports Writer
Although they begin the new year
with a mediocre 6-5 record, the Pitt
Panthenbasketball team finds itself

. in first place in the Easter Eight with

a 3-0 record. They have done so by
handling'St. Bonaventure twice and
Massachusetts once. The season is
long, however, and the Panthers still
face many obstacles. One of'these
hurdles will be Rutgers University
which invades the Field House
tomorrow at I p.m..

Whereas the Panthers were not
really expected to be doing much
better at this stage in the seasonjthe
Scarlet Knights have been a
disappointment to most. Picked by
many to win the Eastern Eight,

Rutgers presently stands fourth in
the conference and has a sub-500
record. ’

Rutgers has had an extremely
tough schedule. Two of their losses
have come on the road in Hawaii

‘ during a tournament. Another has

come at the hands of a good St.
Johns team by the score of 71-70.
Still this Rutgers team has some
pretty heavy guns at its disposal.

In Kelvin Troy the Knights have
an established star. Troy, picked by
Sports Illustrated last year as one of
the five best defensive players in the
country, has been leading the team
in scoring with a l7.3 points per
game average and. also in
rebounding with nearly sever per
game. Troy’s play can be expected

to be at par come Saturday, if not
better. as he has been a Pitt
nemesis the last few years.

The key to this Rutgers team may
well lie in a player who has «not
played a single minute until two

weeks ago. His name is Clarence
Tillman and upon him maywell lie
Rutgers‘ fate. Tillman. a 6-foot-7

transfer from Kentucky, can become '

the complement to Troy that would
make the Scarlet Knights that
much better. Although coach Tom
Young, a native ofNatrona Heights,
is trying to ease Tillman into the
line-up you can bet that if Rutgers
continues its subpar performances,
Tillman will have to adjust to
playing as a starter.

As hard as it is to ligure out
Rutgers‘ poor showing. Pitt’s team is
no easy matter either. This is ateam
that has looked like world beaters
one game and from the European
league the next. The problems are
many.

One problem was the Lennie
McMillan and Eddie Wallace
ordeal. That seems to have
straightened out and McMillan is
once again starting and playing the
defense that has made him a starter.

Over the Christman break, the
Panthers played one tournament

- where they suffered a narrow defeat

to a very good Virginia Tech team
then was routed by a James
Madison team which later on nearly
beat Virginia. In the James Madison
game, Clyde Vaughn \scored a
season high 29 points. Pit-t
rebounded from those losses by
trouncing Massachusetts, then
beating Robert Morris and most

recently defeating St. Bonaventure

by four points. Although they have
looked horrid at times the Panthers
appear to be coming out oftheir bad
spell. Maybe one reason for the
renewed optimism is the fact that
coach Chipman has inserted Steve
Beatty, a freshman, into the starting
center slot. Beatty has shown that he
can handle the position if he is given
time. Certainly mistakes will happen
but the freshman from Slippery
Rock has an adept shooting touch
and may well be the answer.

Of course the Rutgers on
Saturday will be a crucial test for the
Panthers as they battle to stay atop
the Eastern Eight.

Freshman Clyde.Vaughn scored a season high of 29.points forthe Panthers at-A 
the Virginia Tech tournament over Christmas. Vaughn and-the rest of the

Panthers host Eastern Eight rival Rutgers at the Field House tomorrow at 1_ p.m.

Debate has risen once again concerning the

International polls throughout the season to inform
the fans on how different teams are faring each week,
‘as in college basketball. Besides, this will keep the
voters happy also. After the last games have been
played, select the top 16 teams in the nation. This
process could stay at the hands of the writers’ and
coaches’ polls. ’

. The last weekend of the college season is usually the
first Saturday in December. After the top 16 teams
have been selected, pair them up to play in the opening

7 playoff round at the campus ofthe team with the better

I record. The pairings could be made according to
geography and the students and area fans will be able
to see a team in the playoffs.

minor bowl sites. These bowls never meant anything
toward the national title in the present system and with
a playoff stystem would "become more important.

With eight teams left in the hunt for number one, play
the four remaining games at the four biggest minor

bowls with a national television audience, for instance, in
I

the Gator, Fiesta, Liberty and Sun Bowls.

These winners advance to_the New Year‘s Day con-
frontations in the major bowls. The major bowls
could‘ rotate each year so each one will have the college
super bowl game.

All the present arguments against a playoff system
are answered with this simple version. The bowls will
_r_emain intact and actually gain prestige in the process.
The major_ bowls will become more respectable

meaning. And each big bowl will get a chance to host
the championship game.

The minor bowls gain some prestige as well. The
second round games thatare played will have more
meaning with the winner still alive for the national
title. More interest will be generated and with that
more revenue, which the bowls certainly have to like.

The season would not be extended overly long and
the atheletes would not have to miss a large amount of
classes. First of all, the bowl system as it stands.now
begins around December 15 and that is about the-same
time the-opening round of the playoff system would
start. -

Secondly, only a handful ofteams would be affected
and those that get, eliminated would be through for the
year anyway. -

The rest of the minor bowls(lndependance, Garden
State, etc.) could have teams thatjust don’t quite make
the playoffs. There wouldn’t be a _loss of interest
