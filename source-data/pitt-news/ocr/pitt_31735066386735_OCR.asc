addresses
students‘
concerns

By Mark Gordon
Staff Writer

Suits and ties were in abundance
‘along with an appearance from Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor at yes-
terday’s Vice Chancellor’s Forum for
Student Affairs attended by Pitt student
leaders.

William Harmon, the vice chancellor
for student affairs, said the meeting
was very important because, “The
chancellor. felt he was not getting a
true feeling for what the majority of
students on campus stood for.”

The main issue discussed at the
meeting was the pending student
activities fee increase for undergradu-
ate and graduate students at Pitt.
Student Government Board President

Ross Pasquale, Allocations Committee

Chairman Damian Cevallos and SGB
member Heath Golden passed out a
fact sheet containing information
pledging SGB’s support to raise the fee
25 percent to $40. '

O’Connor stressed the importance
“of letting your constituents know
what will will be done with the new
fee.” He added, “Explain all the pro-
grams and resources that are available
through the new money.”

“Rising advertising costs and several
expensive -programs for each organiza-
tion” were cited by Cevallos as reasons
for raising the fee.

The leaders at the forum unanimous-
ly agreed with raising the student
activity fee. Engineering Student
Council President Jeannette Johnson
spoke for a majority of groups on the
benefits of the 25 percent increase.

“Our budget just continues to
increase, and we need more funding
to help our students,” Johnson said.

SEAC protests mining of Wayne Forest

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

A reindeer wearing a T—shirt that said
“The Buck Stops Here” was among those
who barricaded themselves inside the
local branch of the Office of Service
Mining in Greentree last night.

Members of Pitt’s Student
Environmental Action Coalition and
activists from Ohio rallied yesterday
against plans to begin strip mining in
Wayne National Forest in southeastern
Ohio._ According to activists, the “buck”

Multiculturalism workshop discusses

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

As the word “multicultural-.

ism” becomes little more than a
political buzzword around
campus and the real problems
of prejudice and discrimination
are as strong as ever, Pitt’s
Student Government Board and
the Pittsburgh Peace Institute
are trying to move multicultur-
alism from theory to practice.
Sunday afternoon, the SGB
Cultural Diversity Committee
and PPI sponsored a workshop
in the William Pitt Union.
Students in attendance partici-
pated in various activities to

has been passed from one district gov-
ernment to the next.

“We want them to know that were
expecting answers,” said Joe Hazelbaker,
director of the Buckeye Forest Council.

According to Sarah Kraemer of SEAC,
the only answer the Office of Service
Mining was willing to give last night was
to try to halt the protest. At approximate-
ly 8 p.m. last night, OSM called in police
to remove more than 25 activists who
were still protesting. Police refused to
make any arrests, and the acting director
of OSM was called in to deal with the sit-

uauon.

The protest concerns a ruling which
will permit the strip mining to occur due
to the reinterpretation of the term “valid
existing rights” in the Surface Mining
Control and Reclziination Act of 1977.
Activists are worried that other forests
will become likely candidates for mining.
As a result of the ruling, valid existing
rights will be determined by the Office of
Service Mining, which is under the
United States Department of the Interior.

learn how each other’s back-
grounds affect attitudes and
reach conclusions about why
prejudice and discrimination
are such complex problems on
campus.

“The workshop is very pro-
ductive,” Hayes Davis said.
Davis said he attended as a rep-
resentative of the University
Democrats. “During the dia-
logue, you get to know about
the experiences of other people
who are here.” ' '

Marilyn Llewellyn, presenter
and moderator of the «workshop
on behalf of PPI, said the
importance of the workshop is
for people to look at themselves

and others as individuals, then
start to work together on a larg-
er scale. She said conﬂicts can
often arise out of differences in
values- learned from diverse
backgrounds.

“If we start at the personal
level with our own story, than
move to the level of society, it

can lead to social change and
action,” Llewellyn said “An

activity [like this workshop] is a
beginning more than anything
else.” .
-According to statistics provid-
ed by PPI, the United States is
getting more diverse every day.

By the year 2000,. “close to one- .

third” of the school age popula-

tion in the U.S. will be ethnic
minorities, up from the current
mark of 25 percent.

?‘Multiculturalism can’t be dis-
cussed enough,” said partici-
pant and SGB board member
Eric McKinley. “At the work-
shop, you get to learn more
about people you see around
campus.”

Concluding the workshop, V

participants asked what they, as
individuals, could do to be
more sensitive to and apprecia-
tive of the diversity around
them.

“We are trying to raise con-
sciousness about differences
that are among us and the way

that values have been attached
to us,” Llewellyn said.

Students also took part in
exercises such as “Cultural
Clue” which highlighted contri-
butions to society by various
ethnic groups. In another activi-
ty, students formed small
groups and discussed their per-
sonaliethnic background and
how it has shaped their values."
Participants talked about how
discrimination has touched
them personally.

“An activity like this is good
because it heightens aware-
_ness,” said Jeff Zamoff, an inde-
pendent participant. “It gives

people a way of networking, a
way to know other people who
want to change things around
campus."

One problem several people
cited was the low tumout at the
workshop, perhaps because
some publicity was prevented
by last week’s bad weather.

“These dialogues have very-

high potential and more people
should use it to ‘their advan-
tage,” Maegon Barlow said.
Barlow is chair of the SGB
Cultural Diversity Committee.
She said she thought the after-
noon was a success despite the
low turnout.

“It is a good workshop, and
maybe it could reach more peo-
ple if it were done more often,”
participant Pam Wen said.

“But I think many of the peo-
ple who made the effort to
come today already had open
minds.” ‘

The Office of Residence Life

is hoping more people turn out
for the events they have
planned for Diversity Week.
Today’s activities include an art
exhibit and jazz ensemble in
the Towers, as well as a panel
discussion on “Tolerance on
Campus” in the Kurtzman
Room of the WPU.

The Resident Student Association, a group
that represents over 5,000 Pitt students, was in
favor of the increase due to the large costs of
funding events such as the Valentine’s Day
Getaway.

Shira Hassan, co-president of Pitt’s Campus
Women’s Organization, was also in favor of the
increase but said, “We don’t even have a bud-
get. Ours just disappeared because of alloca-
tions and funding.”

Cevallos disputed the claim that the disap-
pearing funds were a result of the Allocations
Committee and cited that errors were made by

_CWO in requesting the funds.

The College of General Studies, while sup-

porting the fee increase, said its lack of funds.

was a direct result of the recent decrease in
enrollment. ,

“We are constantly cutting programs for full-
time students [such as] family dinners and
museum passes,” said Anne Levenson, the CGS
representative.

Two schools represented at the meeting,

pharmacy and nursing, were in favor of the fee

increase but only to aid educational activities.
Cevallos pointed to the Allocations

Committee manual which states “organizations

may only request funds that are consistent with
their purpose.”

Another student fee increase, this one for
graduate students, was supported by Graduate
and Professional Student Association President
Steve Parks. The fee will likely be raised from
$7 to $10 for full—time students, according to
Parks.

O’Connor discussed some other issues raised
by the student leaders. On the issue of housing
for Pitt’s Overall population, the Chancellor
said, “We are exploring possibilities in South
Oakland ‘for Greeks and we are developing a
five-year plan,” to aid graduate students in
finding housing. .

O’Connor also addressed student inquiries
about the use of office space in the William Pitt
Union. Harmon said he and O’Connor will be
in the Union later in the week to investigate
this situation.

Don’t use science to justify prejudice

On Sunday, Simon LeVay, the researcher who discov-
ered evidence that suggests homosexuality has biologi-
cal causes, spoke at Western Psychiatric Institute. LeVay
was responsible for research which linked the size of a
man’s hypothalamus to his sexual preference. He also
spoke about similar research projects which focused on
finding genetic links to sexual preference. In these-
studies, a marker on the X chromosome has been
found to appear in homosexual males and not in het-
erosexuals. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
LeVay spoke to-about 100 people at a fundraising lec-
ture to allay their fears about his research. LeVay was
quoted as saying, “Science is a power that could be
used for good or evil, and a bad use of this would be
to try and cure gays and «lesbians  But this kind of
work helps to roll back the myths of homosexuality,
such as this is something that  [is] the result of patho-
logical behavior.” 0 _

The important point that must not be overlooked is
that science should not be'used to look for ways to jus-
tify a person's lifestyle, because this reinforces the idea
that being gay is wrong. .

Included in the P0st—Gazetz‘e"s article is the story of an
Arizona newspaper editor who reversed his opposition
to homosexual rights legislation after he learned about
the biological links to homosexuality. Yet, there should
not be a stigma attached to homosexuals regardless of
the reason.

Researchers looking into this issue must also be care-
ful to watch how they release their results to the pub-
lic. Adolf Hitler used sham scientific principles to justify
his discrimination against the Jews and other European
minorities. Even though the case of the newspaper edi-
tor seems like a positive response, using biology to
explain an unaccepted behavior ‘will. cause people
who already object to homosexuality to rationalize their

objections on scientific rather than moral grounds.-

Instead oftclaimingthat homosexuality is morally
wrong, they will say-that it is a "genetic defect."

The worse-case scenario with all this research was
explored in the play “The Twilight of the Golds.” In
this play, the main character must make the choice of
whether or not to keep an unborn fetus after discover-
ing that it will be homosexual. This consideration

“should never come up as an issue although if the cur-

rent research is misapplied, "it will. .

Again we see that as the frontiers of science rapidly
expand, new ethical questions are raised. As science
proceeds,-it must be remembered the effects it has
stretch beyond the laboratory and even the halls of
academia. It must also be remembered that we live in a
democracy, not a technocracy. People must learn to
accept others for who they are and not judge them on
any single aspect of their life.

Illegitimacy problem legitmates a concern

Recently on “This Week With
David Brinkley, Charles
Murray, a fellow at the
American Enterprise, Institute,
spoke about illegitimacy and
said that it is America’s most
serious problem. Illegitimacy
traps both the mother and
child into an unending cycle of
poverty, which in turn causes
an increase in drug use and
urban violence. Not to mention
the fact that we, as taxpayers,
are forced by the government
to subsidize their irresponsible
behavior, which inevitably

$29 billion to help support teen
parents and their children in
1990. It is obvious that the U.S.
can no longer afford (monetari-
ly or socially) to allow the gov-
ernment to continue to support
this type of welfare program.
The question then becomes
what can be done?

According to Charles Murray
the government should end
welfare and force parents, not
society, to support their chil-
dren. If they can’t do so, then

‘ the government should put the

children into an orphanage.

hurts the children and society —- in
as a whole. .

Murray says thatthe U.S. 
government is subsidizing ille- ,
gitimacy through welfare pro- D1Cl{€I1Sl1€€tS

grams which sustain America’s
growing underclass. The statis-
tics brought out on the show
clearly support his thesis: 1.2
million illegitimate children are
born every year in the U.S.
which translates into an illegiti-
macy rate of 30 percent, above
those in any other industrial-
ized nation (]apan’s is less than
1 percent). In 1990, two out of
every three black children were
born out of wedlock. By 1992,
the black illegitimacy rate
increased to 68 percent while
the white illegitimacy rate
climbed to 26 percent. It is pre-
dicted that by the year 2000, 80
percent of all minority births
and 40 percent of the total U.S.
births will be illegitimate. In
addition to the aforementioned
side effectsto society, ‘illegiti-
macy also cost the government

Many liberals ‘have attacked
Murray for being a cold-hea1“t—_
ed conservative.

But once again the liberals
missed, the point: by eliminat-
ing the welfare system, hence
the economic incentive to have
children, teens may think twice
about intentionally having chil-
dren. Their parents will be
more involved in their chil-
dren’s lives if they are made -to
foot the bill of raising their
children’s babies. If the babies
are placed in an orphanage,
the parents should help to pay.
Society should not be forced to
pay for parents that didn’t do
their job.

There are two other reasons
for the increase in illegitimacy,
the breakdown of the family

structure and the loss of social
stigma that used to be attached
to having children out of wed-
lock. It is undeniable that the
family values our nation was

‘founded on have rapidly dete-

riorated, and as a direct result
social control has broken
down. Teen mothers having
babies (and teen boys fathering
them) is clearly no longer
viewed as being morally or
socially wrong when the gov-
ernment continues to shell out
money by which they support
that type of behavior. Such a
policy not only hurts the moth-

er and child (in the long run), .' .
but also our society. as a whole. ‘

It is a sad irony that a person

Letter to the Editor

It would be a crying shame if no one respond-
ed to Matt Serlin and Jim Madl’s editorial that
appeared in the January 20th newspaper [The
Pitt News].

In their article, they stated that Lorena Bobbit
was lying about the abuse her husband subject-
ed her to. How would they know? Were they
there? Did they hear any of the testimony? No.
They decided to become judge and jury with no
evidence because they’re afraid that someday,
some woman will follow Lorena’s lead on them.
While I do not condone Mrs. Bobbit’s actions
and I agree that she should not be free from the

proper sentencing, I can understand her “free A

ﬂow of tears.” I find it hard for a woman to go
to such extremes without having a reason, such
as rape. Suppose she is telling the truth. Serlin

and Madl said “a woman like this has no place

in a civilized society.”
Yet they will applaud a man who allegedly
raped his wife, for “keeping his dignity.” If the
charges are true, then a man like this has no
dignity. A man like this has no place in a civi-
lized society.

Pitt hoopsoutmuscles Georg

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

Pitt forward Chris Gant took a
bounce pass in the lane from
teammate Willie Cauley, laid the
ball in the hoop and toppled
over Georgetown’s hot-shooting
point guard Joey Brown (who
scored a game—high 18 points).

The whistle blew. Brown had
fouled out. ,

Gant hopped to his feet and
with the index finger on both
hands leading the way, swung
his arms in a batter’s motion as
if to ‘say, “strike three.” The
Panthers out-muscled the Hoyas
and withstood a late rally to

_ post a 68-60 victory at the Civic

Arena last night.

“They don’t have to give us
nothing,” Cauley said. “‘We’ll
take it.”

Cauley was referring to the
unranked Panthers’ lack of
recognition in the national
polls, but that sentiment was a
perfect description of the way
Pitt (11-4, 6-2 in the Big East)
played against Georgetown (10-
5, 4-3). “ ‘ -

They took it. , » ~

“We’ve been known_for the
team to let down at this point,
but just about the whole team

.. we’re trying not to fall down
this year,” Gant said.

The -Panthers assaulted the
Hoyas man-to-man defense
with a three-point shooting bar-
rage in the first half. Pitt singed
the net six-of-seven times (85
percent) from beyond the
stripe.

Georgetown, conversely,‘ did’

not sink a single three-pointer’

and struggled offensively under
the weight of a stingy Panther
zone. The Hoyas, dogged by 15

fells dashes

first half turnovers (21 in the
game), assisted Pitt in building a
38-23 halftime lead.

In the second half, the
Panthers continued their early
dominance by increasing the
lead to 21 points —- twice. The
first time was off an Eric Mobley
turnaround—hook shot right in
front of Georgetown center
Othella Harrington. They did it
again when Orlando Antigua
(12 points) connected on a
leaning one—hander at the 14:38
mark.

But the Panther’s three-point
shooting nose dived, going
zero-for—seven in the second
half, which allowed the
Hoyas to storm back into the
game.

Georgetown then chipped
away at Pitt’s lead when they
got their first three-pointer of
the game from senior Lamont
Morgan.

“Georgetown is good for
coming back and they made
their run,” said Ahmad Shareef,

"who scored 15 points.

Morgan’s basket was the only
field goal the Hoyas would see
from their bench, including
George Butler (who leads the

Hoyas with 15.2 per game), ,
' who did not score a point in the

contest.

Brown and Harrington came
alive during this stretch, scoring
a combined 16 points, and at
the 4:17 mark Mobley fouled
out on Brown’s drive into the
lane. After Brown‘ hit both free
throws, Pitt’s 21-point lead had
dwindled to three, 56-53. L

The Panthers soon gathered
themselves and held off
Georgetown’s surge.

“We were ready. We were
prepared for [the Hoyas’ runl,”

..

 

Gant said.

McCullough, who scored 15
points and dished out six
assists, found Cauley (12 points)
underneath the basket for an
easy layup to give Pitt a 59-53
advantage.

Navy holds off Pitt Wrestling rally, 2 1-14

ozfer M CRae’s
trozc/e record

By Jason Feuchtwanger
staff Writer

It’s tough to break Pitt’s record for run-
ning "the fastest 55-meter dash in school
history.

NCAA champion at 55 meters, Lee
McRae, holds that distinction. He’s also
the world record holder at the distance
with a time of 6.00 seconds.

So Dietrich Jells will have to settle for
the second best time in Pitt’s history after

running 6.30 in the 55-meter dash this‘

past weekend at Virginia Tech. Jells tied
Eric Cannon for second: best in Pitt histo-
ry.
“You can run 6.01 and you can have
the second fastest time ever, but you will
also be second on our [55-meter dash
fastest times] list,” Pitt head track coach
John Vasvary said. “He ran a very, very

good time and especially at this time of S

the year.”

Jells might be tied for the second
fastest time in school history, but
he came in third place at Virginia

Sometimes to take a couple of steps
forward, a team must take a step back-
wards.

Saturday night before a big crowd at
Fitzgerald Field House, the Pitt
wrestling team received an important
lesson on what it takes to be a top
team. You must find a way to win the
close matches. ,

Come-from-behind magic from the
Panthers’ "bag-of-tricks was not enough
as Pitt fell to the Navy Midshipmen 21-
14.

Aside from the first two matches of
the evening, the Panthers hung tough

against a strong Navy team.

Despite close matches in the middle
and lower weight classes, head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said that he believes
his team did not perform with enough
savvy to pull out the match.

“They ran us into the dirt,”
Stottlemyer said. “I was very disap-
pointed with our effort tonight. You
have to be able to win some of the
close matches.

The night started out poorly for the
Panthers, with their first two wrestlers

being overwhelmed by their Navy
counterparts.

Neither Chris Stevens nor Louis Leeds
could get anything started in either of
their matches, and both lost by lop-
sided scores of 13-0 and 13-3 respec-
tively.

Pitt sophomore john Richey contin-
ued his solid. season by raising his
record for the year to 12-4 with a victo-
ry in the 134 lbs. division.

The first period was nip—and-tuck
with Richey holding a slim 2-1 lead.
Richey controlled the action through-
out the second period but could not
add to his lead. With solid hard work
and a great deal of agility, Richey put
the match away in the third period to
win, 6-2. A

Pitt then lost two disheartening, one-
point matches.

Neither Brett Gould or Sean Hoover
backed up an inch to their Navy" oppo-
nents, but neither had enough to seal a
victory for the Panthers and went down
by scores of 1-0 and 2-1'. A

At the 158 lbs. weight class, Eric
Yanek also came up a little short, los-
ing 6-4 in overtime.

Down 18-3, a comeback was entirely
possible with the Panthers’ big guns

coming up.Rich Catalano did his part

.winning via a technical fall, 25-8, at 167

lbs.

Doug Zembiec of Navy dwarfed Pitt’s
Derek Burgert during their 177 lbs.
match. Burgert could not overcome his
opponent’s distinct height advantage.

Behind 21-8, and with the match out
of reach, Pitt’s Jeff Kloiber didn’t wres-
tlevwith his usual aggressiveness, but
secured a victory with 7-3 win.

“With the match out of hand, the
coaches didn’t want me to go out and
just take the guy down,” Kloiber said.

Heavyweight Pat Wiltanger had to go
into overtime to win his match via a
two-point takedown, 3-1.

“We can’t put the big guys down
[behind] and expect to win,”
Stottlemyer said. _

“I think we wrestled as well as we
could have,” assistant coach Jim
Beichner said. “We’re going to win and
lose close matches.”

In the end, the close defeats are what
hurt the Panthers Saturday night. Better
production from the lighter weights is
essential to Pitt's future success.

Yohman commented that the
floor performances looked real-
ly nice. Bethany Toellner and
Robyn Senior added new tum-
bling to their routines and exe-
cuted them successfully. The
scores for these routines were
9.4 and 9.1 respectively. Other
competitors were Michelle Cole
(8.9), Meg Johns (8.95) and
Brenda Stevens (9.25).

Yohman said that the vault
and the uneven parallel bars
were exciting.

Pitt’s vaulters were Christine

(9.1), Lori Buck (9.0), Senior
(9.4) and Stevens (9.275).

The bar scores were Johns

Senior (9.275) and Stevens

Although the Lady Panthers
proved that they could perform
nicely on the balance beam at
their previous meet, Pitt gym-
nasts fell off the beam eight
times at the Temple meet.
Toellner scored 8.15, Johns 7.6,
Buck 8.7, Cole 8.75, Senior 94
and Stevens 9.0.‘

Yohman said that although
the gymnasts were upset by the
falls on beam, they held them-
selves together and maintained
a competitive attitude.

“They dida goodijob on
coaching themselves,” Yohman
said.

This Sunday the Lady
Panthers travel to the University

Only a photo finish declared
who won and who came in
third. .

Cedric Davis. from Tennessee
State and Jells were both
clocked at 6.30, while Gerald
Howard from University of
Virginia won with a time of
6.29.

Vasvary said that Jells was in
a virtual dead heat for second
place, and the photo was
kind of blurry, but the judges
ruled that Jells was just a frac-
tion late in leaning for the finish
line.

Jells was part of a split Pitt
m_en’s track team that traveled
to Blacksburg, Va. to compete
against schools from the Atlantic
Coast Conference, South-
eastern Conference and some

of the smaller schools in
Virginia.

The Panthers finished in
eighth place with 35 points.
Host Virginia Tech blew away
the rest of the field with 142
points.

The University of Virginia fin-
ished second with 67 points.
However, this is not an accurate
illustration of the team’s perfor-
mance.

The Panthers did not have
everyone competing for them at
Virginia Tech, splitting up and
deciding to take the distance
runners along with others to
Robert Morris College to com-
pete.

Along with Jells’ performance,
there were other positive signs
for the team.

Cuitis Anderson won the 200
meters with a time of 22.61.

Anderson combined with Jells
and rookies Orrel Green and
Jerel Williams to win and
qualify for IC4As in the 4x400
relay.

“The freshmen are adapting
real well and just stepping up
and doing a good job,” Vasvary
said.

Jay Murphy placed second in
the 55-meter hurdles with a time
of 7.69.

“He would have won it,”
Vasvary said. “A kid hit his trail
leg and sort of bumped him. It’s
surprising he hung on for sec-
ond.

“Jay looked real good, he
looked real powerful [before he
got bumped]. I’m real pleased
with what got accomplished at
the meet.”

After running the ninth—fastest
time in the '55-meter dash in

school history -last week,
Anthony Dorsett hit a setback at
Virginia Tech.

Dorsett was running in the
200 meters when he injured his
hamstring.

“He was on his way from any-
where from first to third place.
He came off the turn like he
was shot from a gun, and then

- he said he felt something in his

leg,” Vasvary said.

Dorsett was examined by a
trainer at Virginia Tech
who said it wasn’t a tear (in
the muscle).

Dorsett will be evaluated
again this week, this time by
Pitt’s trainer.

The Panthers had no trouble
with the competition at Robert
Morris, as they put together a
string of victories.

Pitt won the distance medley

with the team of Ed Adamson
Mike Bufalini, Dennis Kuntz
and Mike Lynn.

Frank Nesko and Mike
Umbleby tied for first in the
mile with a time of 4:02.
Daymon Williams won the 500
meters.

Lynn, Kuntz, Matt Clarkson
and Brian McCollough swept
the first four places in,the 3,000
meters.

Mike Bufalini combined with
his brother Mark, Adamson
and Williams to win the 4x400
relay.

“The purpose [of running at
Robert Morris] was to get them
on the track  to test some
people [who are coming off
injury and sicknessl,” Vasvary
said.

“All in all it was a real good
weekend.”
