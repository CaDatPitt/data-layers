Steinem: Feminism is Concerned With Five Basic Issues f

By CHRIS CLINTON
7/Pill News Staff Writer

The American feminist movement
has accomplished some ofthe things
it set out to do since its resurgence in
the 1960s, according to well-known
feminist and writer, Gloria Steinem.

Steinem, speaking at David Law-
rence Auditorium Wednesday night,
said women are now “becoming the
men they wanted to marry." She
labeled the l980s ' as the “second
decade of the second wave of
feminism.” .

Feminism is nowconcerned with

.---.,,five basic “themes,” according to.

Steinem: reproductive freedom, vio-
lence against women, work, family
life and culture.

Steinem said the lack of control
that women have over their own
bodies is “the cause of their secon-
dary status. _ .

“lt’s become a great health con-
cern," she said. “The understanding
of turning women into child-bearing
machines has brought women into
an awareness of the necessityiof
reproductive freedom.“ '

,¢.,g_ She said that before conception
‘I was understood, motherhood was
worshipped. .

“It was the discovery ofthe under-
standing of conception thatﬁbegain to
lower women’s status,” Steinem
said.

She claimed that the right—wing
groups in America believe that if

—women gain reproductive freedom,

it would be a threat to the nation. -
“Weare not radicals,” she said. i

“The system is radically wrong.’’

Steinem views violence against
women as the direct result of sex
roles in a society and pronography
as the tool which keeps it
flourishing. , .

“Pornography is to women what
the KKK is to racial groups and
what anti-Semantic groups is to reli-
gion,” Steinem said.

She called men “aggression jun-
kies” through no fault of their own
but because of the way they are
taught, She said the only successful
treatment for rape and wife abuse is
treating aggression as an addiction. ~

“They’re now telling women that
success will make them sick because
of stress,” according to Steinem.
“Failure makes you sick, not suc-
cess. The highest rate of stress-
related‘ illness is" in poor black‘
women not white middle class men,"

Steinem commented that femi-
nists are trying to rnakejobs valued
for-the jobitselfand not for the per-
son who does the job. ._

“Whenever a profession becomes
made up of 30 percent ofa depressed
class, .it is devalued,” she‘ said. 7

Steinem placed some blame of

_,women’s "inequality on the right-

wing groups that now have political
power.

it really means they’re anti-women,”

ransplant a Success

By KAREN GRZYB|CKl'

Pin News Staff Writer

The first liver transplant ever per-
_formed at Presbyterian Hospital
was a success, according to hospital
officials.‘ . ‘

I The patient is in satisfactory con-
dition following the l2 hour surgery
that began Wednesday at l0 p.m.
The operation was performed by Dr.
Thomas Starzl, professor of surgery
at the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine. is

-In a press conference Thursday
afternoon, Starzl said that the o_per-
ation was satisfactory, but it will be

law and children that they’re
against. _ _ ,

“They’re against funding for bat-
tered children, battered wives, which
they call ‘runaway wives’ and they
want to take funds away from litera-
ture where women 'aren’t portrayed
in a traditional role," Steinem said.

She said , that the government.
must _realize the’ different family

i structuresVin,America and that peo- .

ple should be able to’ choose which
one they want. The government

_ should -not dictate that structure,
according to Steinem.

 Local Groups To Play At Forbes, First Time In Hall

By J.D. KLEINKE

Entertainment Editor

Rock and roll critic David Reuss
once termed it.“primitive rock.” But
regardless of its specific label, origi-
nal music is being written and per-
formed here in Oakland, and it will
debut Friday night within the
perimeters of the University.

7‘

A party featuring three of Oak-.

land’s more publicized, but less vis-
ible bands will occupy the relatively
spacious second floor lounge of the
Forbes Residence Hall. The gather-
ing is being mastermindedby the
Maggotts, the Forbes Hall—based
group.

The sponsors of the party cleared
the event with Forbes Hall resident
director, Ron Sofo, complying with
university security and other dormi-
tory regulations.

“The campus needs someplace
like this—parties with live music,”
Sofo believes. “As long as security

".-«policy is maintained. There really

shouldn’t be any problems,” he
added. '

The event marks a major break-
through for local music. For the first
time, those obscure band names

scrawled on every conceivable sur-
face in Oakland will come to life in
the eyes of the general public. Mak-
ing their first public appearance, the
Maggotts will bejoined by the Whe-
reabouts and the Rum Hounds.
Bothe the Hounds and the Wherea-
bouts are veterans of the local
underground music scene, but
tonight marks their first perfor-
mance for a less “cultist" audience.

‘‘I’m looking forward to the expo-
sure,” commented Jeff, a Wherea-
bout and a Pitt alumnus. “At the
Banana (the Electric Banana on
Bigelow Blvd.) we reach only a very
narrow crowd." .

..leff feels that the party will offer
students “a chance to gain exposure
to music a little more frantic than
usual."

This is‘ exactly ‘how all three
groups regard their material. Often
referred to as “punk” or“new wave,”
their music is more accurately des-
cribed as “back-to-basics” rock and
roll with a pronounced twist. It con-
tains all the essential elements of the
art form: it’s loud, fast, and grabs
you by the throat.

Maggott guitarist Carlos des-
cribes his band’s music as a “mix
between early Clash and Ramones.”

Together since January, the group
plays all original material.

Russ, another Maggott, affection-
ately refers to their music as “dis-
gusting songs about animals."

He is speaking of the Maggotts
repertoire which includes songs
entitled, f‘I Am a Dog,” “Killer Pen-
guins,” and “Three Decaying
Worms.”

But like the music of the Rum
Hounds and the Whereabouts, the
Maggotts’ music is clever and self-
expressive. The Maggotts wrote a
song called “Engineers Can Be Dis-
gusting.” And yes, they are engi-
neers. . .

. . .As are most of the all-female
Rum Hounds. In fact, every member
of the three bands is either a Pitt
student or a recent graduate, lending
the event an even greater signifi-

.cance in terms of its relationship

with the university community.

RuthAnn,'guitarist for the Rum
Hounds, is looking forward to the
opportunity since, as she puts it, “it’s
a chance for students to see what we
are about, that we are more thanjust
a name on the wall.”

Culturally, tonight's party repres-

university activity. One of Oakland ‘s
most progressive creative outlets, its
domestic rock and‘roll, will surface
in front of the general community.
community.

Gina, a sophomore civil'engineer-
ing major and bassist for the Rum
Hounds, ascribes to the event, a spe-
cial importance. According to her,

“people will finally accept the fact - '

that women are capable of playing
original material.” ~

Coordinator of the event, and
illustrious Maggott, Zobb feels that
the party just may be his band’s
“springboard to stardom.”

_ Rum Hound Marie urges her fel— A
low students to “come see us before ’
London Calls." She adds, “But then
again, I‘m mute anyway.” But then
again, Marie is the druhnmer.

  Time To Raise
A Voice

Legislation to provide funding for Pennsylvania
rape crisiscenters and domestic violence programs has
been reintroduced to .the Pennsylvania Senate and
House. The fact that such necessary legislation failed
to pass the first time points_out the need forlegislators
to become more educated and aware of their constitu-
ents’ needs.

Money is nojustification for failing to approve this
legislation. Pennsylvania taxpayers would not be
required to pay one extra cent; instead, those‘ who
committed the crime would_help pay for assistance to
the victims through a $10 increase in costs imposed on
convicted criminals.

Thejustification for approving this bill is logical and
sound. Yet, the same bill “died inthe House'Appropri-
ations Committee”last year, according to its sponsors. *

Perhaps the Pennsylvania legislators haven’t made v
themselves aware enoughiof the facts concerning rape,
and the need for assistance, counseling and shelter for
victims, to support such legislation.

But in Pennsylvania lastyear, over 100,000 women
. __ and their children received counseling or shelter. Rape
”  ‘ is increasing, but convictions are not; of the 3200

sexual assaults reported in Pennsylvania, 308‘ defendi ..

ants were brought to

court,’ and only 68 were
convicted. ' '

Obviously, money is not a roadblock to passage of the
A bill. E ' V‘ i

Undoubtedly, the legislature has no reason for ref-
using to pass this bill other than their belief that sup-
port for victims who have just undergone a physically

andemotionally shatteringexperience isn’t all that -'

important.

Hopefully, the legislature will refrain from playing
political games and support the legislation this time

‘around. And, ifin Pennsylvania, funding is a result of '

who cries the loudest, supporters of rape crisis centers
had better let their feelings be known. Unless this bill
passes, the centers are likely to close down within two
years.

The Art of Being A Feminist

B)/CHRIS CLINION
Pin News Staff Writer

I

She is gentle, soft-spoken, attrac-

I - tive and intelligent. She possesses

qualities ofa “typical” woman. That
possession either denounces her or
puts her on a pedestal, depending on
wh_o you talk to. She uses those qual-
ities as an asset, not a handicap.

Gloria Steinem presents herself as
a woman. She’s not afraid to be a
woman. Some feminists that I know
seem to have neuterized themselves.
They appear to be frightened of
using the qualities that have been
socially ingrained in their minds as
an advantage, qualities that are most
human and can belidentified with

men and women alike. ,

.For example, women are taught
to have patience. To coin’ a phrase,
they learn that it is a virtue. Ms.
Steinem exercised her virtue in our
interview.

Although it was evident that she
was tired, she listened carefully and
answered in full all the questions I
threw at her. She has probably heard
most of those questions many times

 

in the past. Yet she acted as if she
had the whole night to .speak with
me.

Patience may be a human quality
but I seriously doubt that a man ‘of
Ms. S:teinem’s public standing
would-take the time to be attentive
and cooperative while a collegejour-
nalist struggled with questions. .

The feminist movement can learn
from the way _ Ms. Steinem
approaches sexually-deﬁned stereo- ‘
types. Women who are brought up
with certain attitudes and traits find
it very difficult to change. Their
characteristics slfould not be denied,
however. They should be used to
help the feminist cause on a more
personal and human level.

Ms. Steinem also appeared to
possess a certain amount of
modesty, which seems to be uncom-
mon for most people_ofher caliber. 1.
related a story to her in which a
woman that my father represents in
his union told him that Gloria Stei-
nem “got me my job.” A job which
has been all-male until very recently.

\ Ms. Steinem seemed somewhat‘

embarrassed by/the impact her work

had on this woman’s life. She recog-
nized the woman’s success as her
own achievement and basically
denied having any impact, although
she did say that incidents like that
make her work worthwhile.
Which brings me to the final point '

2?};

of Ms. Steine_rn’s humanness. She»:

has a great deal of class. She recog-
nizes people‘s' individuality and tries
to stray ‘away from generalization.
She seems as if she puts out a full
conscious effort to recognize the
uniqueness in every human being,
something that many feminists I
know do not do. They attack the
individual male, rather than society, .
as being woman's enemy.

Ms. Steinem views herself as. an
individual. woman fighting for
women’s equality. She doesn’t
necessarily see herself as being a
figurehead for the feminist move-
ment. To her, she isjust an “aiverage”

 

-woman working for a cause in which 22;
she believes. a_\ i

This became evident after the
interview when I asked her for her
autograph. She said she would give
it to me on one condit_ion—_ifl gave
her mine, from “one feminist‘ to
another.” '

Pitt Gains Homecourt, Rutgers T

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Sports Writer

Before Wednesday night, the Pitt-
Rutgers confrontation. tomorrow
was going to decide whether the
Panthers or the Scarlet Knights
would get the homecourt advantage
for the first round of the Eastern
Eight Tournament. However,
Duquesne defeated Rutgers Wed-
nesday 69-68, assuring Pitt offourth
place in. the conference and the
homecourt advantage.

When the Panthers travel to New
Jersey to play Rutgers, it will now
decide who the Panthers will be fac-
ing in the first round. Rutgers, 6-6 in
conference play, needs a win over
the Panthers to maintain fifth place.
A Pitt victory would drop Rutgers
into a tie with St. Bonaventure (6-7
in the conference). Since the Bonnies

have already defeated Rutgers twice -

this season, St. Bonaventure would

The Pitt Pant/hers wrestling team
has been given what all teams with
poor records pray for —— “new life.”
The grapplers, who posted a dismal
4-l4 record during the dual meet
season. will start optimistically with
a clean slate at the upcoming East-
ern Wrestling League Tournament

this Saturday and Sunday at Cleve-
land State.

The league tournament, which is
one of the top five of‘its kind in the
country, features the nation’s ninth-
ranked squad, Clarion'State, as well
as-top-notch teams like Penn State,
Bloomsburg, and West Virginia.
Though the Panthers finished last in

the seven-team conference during
the dual season, assistant coach

Chuck Coryea feels that the Panth-

ers are a better team intournament
competition.

. “We’re more healthy now than at A

any point in the stretch. We’ve had
good ‘practices the past_two weeks
and we’re looking for a good finish

that will catapult us into a‘ good sea- \

son next year,” said Coryea.

will be held at the Pitt_Field

Tickets may be purchased for

“I don’t care who we play,” said
‘coach Roy Chipman, “just as long as '
we’re at home. If we lose to Rutgers,
l’m very confident that we will beat

-them Tuesday night. I don’t think

that they can-beat us two times in

three days the way we have been
playing.” '

Rutgers leads the series with Pitt,
13-6, but the Panthers haven’t won a
game against the Scarlet Knights
since the I974-75 season, including
no victories in Eastern Eight
competition.

According to’Chipman,' Rutgers"
strong point is its rebounding and
running game.

“We have to slow them down into
their set offense. They have more
trouble that way. And we also have
to rebound the ball more,” ‘said
Chipman.

Pitt is coming off a 40-point_vic-
tory over conference cellar-dweller
Massachusetts Tuesday night, but in

-the process the Panthers suffered

some key injuries. Carlton Neverson

Wallace is fine, according to
Chipman, and Paul Brozovich, who r

still in doubt. If he is not 100 percent,
the Pitt coach will sit him out of the
