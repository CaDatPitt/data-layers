News Editor '

The body of Pitt freshman Justin Hayduk % who was missing
for more than two months —— was found in the Monongahela River

last week.

According to the Morgantown police, the Charnbersburg
native’s body was found Tuesday in Granville, W.Va., a town four
miles west of .Morgantown, W.Va., where police initially focused

their search.

Hayduk was last seen at about 2 a.m. on March 10, when he
was visiting friends at West Virginia University during Pitt’s spring
break. According to police, he was approached by a Morgantown

Kille was questioned by the ofﬁcers 
and cited for public intoxication, :
but Hayduk ran from the police. 

After his disappearance, detec- 
tives, dogs and divers searched for 
the missing teen-ager as his friends 
and family traveled to and from 
Morgantown in hopes that they I
could be of some help in-the inves-
tigation. Hayduk’s ﬁiends and fra-

Police ended the river search for Hayduk last
month, but his parents maintained hope, even posting
a Web site where friends and strangers alike posted
messages.

Poem Chase

VV1th softly spoken words and a strong
conviction, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell
urged Pitt’s law school graduates to reﬂect
and then reconsider the reason for choosing
law as their course of study before unleash-
ing themselves into the world of business,

T government and politics.

Saturday’s large crowd at Soldiers and

‘ Sailors Auditorium remained modestly

quiet as Campbell reminisced about his
days in law school at Duke University and
encouraged the “lawyers for the new rnil.-
lennium” to “use the law as an instrument

of change.”
It was this same desire to change that
‘ placed Campbell on Newsweek

' Magazine’s list of the 25 most dynamic

mayors.
Introducing himself to the audience of
graduates, faculty, friends and family, the

mayor proudly referred to Atlanta as
Pittsburgh’s “sister city from the Sou ” and
the “new capital of the South.”

Campbell quickly addressed the stereo-
type of the South: “slow-talking, dimwitted,
trucking-driving idiots,” and conﬁrmed its
basic truth. His own immediate laughter
won the favor of the crowd.

The mayor attributed his “moral irnper—
ative to change” model‘ to the ideas and

, beliefs of Thurgood Marshall and his prece-

dent—setting work on the Brown vs. Board
of Education Supreme Court case.

To illustrate the need for a change in
education, Carnpbellshared a story about a
student-teacher relationship with the crowd.

“‘Which is worse?’ asked the teacher,
‘ignorance or apathy?’, to which the student
replied, ‘I don’t know, and I don’t care.”’

The crowd ‘roared, but the seriousnes
of topic continued. ‘ i

“More than to congratulate you, I came
here to challenge you — cleanse the world
of racial bias,” the mayor said. “Nowhere

Atlanta mayor addresses law grads”

else is there more bias than in the ﬁeld of
administration of justice.”

Campbell said that black youths are six
times more likely to be sentenced to juve-
nile prison than their white counterparts. He
also said blacks are 48 times more likely to
serve time for ‘drugs than all other races.

Campbell ‘ said these ‘ issues require _.

immediate attention before “social chaos”
ensues. . _
He pleaded with the “lawyers for the
new millennium” to ‘resist thebinding
shackles of the people before them and
urged them to remember the people who
tackled apartheid and brought down the
Berlin Wall.
“Those people,” he said, “are like you.”
Quoting the American poet Robert

’ Frost, Campbell told graduates that when

two roads diverge, take the road less trav-
eled. .
He continued to focus on the positive,

Two local arts organizations
recently announced the Greater
Pittsburgh Poem Chase, a contest
designed to send Pittsburghers scurry-

ing around their city in an effort to '

piece together the scattered lines of a
Pittsburgh poet.

The lines have been placed on
banners in prominent positions
throughout the city. Each line leads the
searcher to the next. The barmers are
all easily visible from the street and
may be found on buildings, billboards,
fences, decks or even hanging over-
head.

The brainchild of Laurie Graham,
writer and editor for Scribners, and
Christina Springer, a performance poet
and director of local arts organization
Sun Crumbs, Poem Chase was born
when the twowere asked by the Andy
Warhol Museum to come up with fresh
ideas to reinvent Pittsburgh.

“What they wanted us to do is take
the themes of Pittsburgh’s past and
reinvent them to carry the city into the
future,” Graham said.

The subject of the chase is thelast
10 lines of a poem that is rumored to
be a series of images describing the
Strip District. Once the lines have
been put together, a player can submit
an entry at the 'chase’s Web site (poem-
chase.org) or submit a written entry at
a local Carnegie Library branch. After
June 30, the entire poem and the name
of the local poet who wrote it will
appear in InPittsburgh Weekly and on
the Greater Pittsburgh Poem Chase’s

,Web site.

The first 100 people to complete
the chase will receive a free Greater
Pittsburgh Poem Chase T-shirt and be
in the running for the grand prize,
which includes tickets to cultural
events and a Pirates game and $100.

Graham and Springer felt that the
best way to reinvent conceptions of
Pittsburgh was to look at those themes
through new eyes not usually familiar
to the public.

University undergrads win
Beckman research grant

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND

Staff Writer

Not many undergraduates get excited
about mutated secretory proteins. But then
again, not many students are given nearly
$l4,0()0 to study them.

Pitt junior Robert Lee and senior
Wﬂliarn McCoy IV were selected as the
ﬁrst two Pitt recipients of the Beckman
Scholars Fellowship Program, a national
program designed to foster scientiﬁc
research among promising undergraduate
students. ’

Pitt was chosen to give out two grants,
each running approximately 15 months, per
year for the next three years by the Amold
and Mabel Beckman Foundation. The
recipients each receive $5,500 for two sum-
mers and $3,600 during the school year.

“Pitt had to show it provided an envi-

ronment that supported outstanding under-
graduate researc ” said Dr. Lyme Hunter,
a professor of biological sciences. Hunter
coordinated interactions between the sci-
ence departments that ultimately decided
on the fellowship recipients, including the
departments of biological sciences, chem-
istry, bioengineering and chemical and
petroleum engineering.

Undergraduate students were invited
to submit detailed applications, along with
a proposal for a study project, a transcript of
grades and two letters of recommendation.
The selection committee then interviewed
the top prospects from that batch. The

recipients will each work in a lab under the ‘

supervision of a Pitt faculty member.

“I work around 30 to 40 hours a week
in the 1 ,” said Lee, who uses his research
to study how proteasome —— a part of the
cell — deals with deformed proteins.
According to Lee, this study could later
lead to developing treatment for a number
of diseases including cystic ﬁbrosis.

Lee, who had already been working on
the subject under the direction of Dr. J effrey
Brodsky, said that he’s “excited_the money
allows me to continue towork with him.”

McCoy, who works in the lab of Dr.
Linda Jen-Jacobson, is studying how cer-

quoting the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther
King, who considered life’s most persisting
and enduring question, “What are you
doing for others?”
The mayor presented yet another chal-
lenge. ‘ .
“One of my favorite proverbs,” he
said, “is we_live in cities we do not buil .”

Campbell said that we are living in
prosperous times with the highest home-
ownership rates and lowest unemployment
rates in years.

“Use the laws to build up the commu-
nity,” he said.

Praising the alumni of Pitt’s law school
for various successes as CEOS of business-
es, judges and state senators, the mayor

. urged the graduates to  the philos-

ophy of the highest court in the nation and
maintain equal justice under the law.
In a ﬁnal thought to the crowd,

' Campbell encouraged graduates . to fear

less, hope more; hurt less, help more; talk
less, say more; hate less, and love more.

mayor and its third black mayor in a land-
slide victory in 1993, and was re—elected in

tain DNA strands recognize and ‘interact

“Understanding how proteins bind
will help in studying a lot of diseases like
cancer,” he said.

McCoy admits that few of his fellow
students are as excited as he is about pro-
tein molecules, but said he has always been
interested in gene research.

“The scholarship allows me to work

here in the lab and do more speciﬁc‘

research on this topic,” he said.
, At the end of next summer, McCoy
and Lee will be invited to a symposium of
all Beckman scholars and will possibly
give a speech about their research. Both
also hope to parlay their experience into
future careers in biological research.

“I hope to be doing this until I’m old
and gray and can’t see,” McCoy said.

erary lens rather than through the old-
smoky-city—steel-mill image will help
us to move beyond the old image that
still lingers,” Graham said.

The Poetry Chase aims to spread
this wider understanding of Pittsburgh
through community involvement.
Also, by getting people active in
searching out the poem all over the
city, Graham and Springer hope to get
Pittsburghers to better understand
Pittsburgh as a community.

“Poem lines will turn up in neigh-
borhoods people may be unfamiliar
with, making 0’ them more aware of
neighborhoods -they may not have
known before,” the chase’s Web site
suggests. '

FROM PAGE 1

Graham also feels
Pittsburghers are too localized.

“Pittsburghers typically don’t go
into other neighborhoods,” she said.
“They don’t think of themselves as
much as a city as a they think of them-
selves as an individual neighborhood.”

After coming up with the initial
concept of Poem Chase for the Warhol
Museum, Graham and Springer felt so
strongly about it that they put it into
action by gathering support from local
organizations and businesses, calling
for poem submissions and planning the
locations of the lines. I

The chase’s primary sponsors

include InPittsburgh, tech ﬁrm Drutis ‘
. & Company, the Heinz Endowments,

the Juliet Lea Hillman Foundation, the
Carnegie Library network, the Laurel
Foundation and Port Authority Transit,

that p

which is helping in a unique way.
Beginning sleuths can start the chase
by looking on the sides of Port

Authority buses for their first clue. An .

advertisement displayed on more than
80 of the Authority’s 1,000 buses hints
the location of the first line, which the
chase’s Web site says is somewhere on
the South Side. A
“We just liked the idea,” said Bob
Grove, a spokesman for the Port
Authority. “We thought it was very

interesting, and we wanted to be a part I

of it.”

So far, 15 people have successful-
ly constructed the poem. Another
chase is scheduled for September and
may take place throughout Pittsburgh’s
local parks.

“We just want people to have fun,”
Graham said.

Branding sex offenders

  is not an adequate solution

A Corpus Christi, Texas,
judge recently modernized “The
Scarlet Letter” heroine Hester
Prynne’s famed dilemma. On May
18, Judge J. Manuel Banales
added 21 people to Hester’s ranks,
ordering them to brandish virtual
scarlet letters, signs reading
“Danger: Registered Sex
Offender Lives Here,” on their
homes and similarly worded
stickers on their cars.

“Wherever they go, whatever
time of day or night, we want peo-
ple to be aware of where these
offenders are,” Banales said.

In short, Banales ordered that
these sex offenders, who have
served all the time that the law
requires, to wear their sins con-
stantly.

Banales seems to be forget-
ting the underpinnings of the
American criminal justice system.

You are innocent until proven
guilty in a trial by a jury of your
peers. Once sentenced, you pay
your debt to society in the form of
jail time, fines or community ser-
vice. Once you have fulfilled the
obligations of this sentence, you
go on your way, attempting to’
reintegrate into “normal” society.

How can society expect
someone to reintegrate with this
kind of scarlet letter hanging on

his home and car?

The judge’s ruling has yielded
immediate results, including sui-
cide attempts, evictions, vandal-
ism and threats of violence to sex
offenders in Texas.

Having these signs constantly
around them is simply too
extreme. Everyone, even convict-
ed sex offenders, has rights to per-
sonal space. Any sanctuary these
former criminals might have from
their pasts is violated by this pub-
lic demoralization.

Banales, as well as others in
his position and our society at
large, needs to reconsider other
options for protecting potential
victims of sex crimes.

Texas — and the rest of the
states in our nation — needs to
create proactive community pro-
grams. Communities should edu-
cate potential victims about how
to avoid dangerous situations and
where to go to seek treatment
when necessary.

Alternatively, potential treat-
ments, in the form of medication
and therapy, need _to be explored
to determine if convicted sex
offenders can be better reintegrat-
ed into society.

Clearly, ostracizing people in
a Puritanical-style is not the
answer.

ASAO LUIS, Brazil — After spending 48
hours in and out of airports, our group of 10
female Pitt students arrived May 13 in Sao 
Situated on an island in the isolated northeastern" 8“ ‘
region of Brazil, Sao Luis is both a beautiful and
impoverished city, something to.which both rich
and poor Brazilians alike will attest. ‘

Sao Luis was founded by the Portuguese,

settled by the French, brieﬂy occupied by the
Dutch and then ﬁnally reclaimed by

the Portuguese in the 17th century. MONICA
FAUST

Today the city is a reﬂection of
indigenous, European and African
cultures. The cobblestone-streets in
the downtown area and the colorful
Capoeira——agracefulAfrican form ofmartial
arts -— demonstrations in the plazas make the tour
manuals come to life.

Vlfrth their city lying just 2 degrees south of

ERIC LIDJI

Senior Staff Writer

There is something beautiful about the ability to
create a sense of variety. That beauty comes from
experiencing a series of things each so different and

unique, yet sharing a common element, linking tl1em- _
selves together while begging for an appearance of '

separation.

Over the Rhine, the Ohio-based husband
and wife team of Karin Bergquist. and
Linford Detweiler explores this notion
extremely well instrumentally, vocally and
lyrically in Films for Radio, their ﬁrst studio
album in ﬁve years. .

Each song examines and sounds like something
heard before, but then changes to something different.
A song will sound like a standard pop tune, but then
the depth of instrumentation - begins’ to form and
mature in your head, creating something much more

’ complex and sophisticated than a typical song.

Detweiler, who primarily writes the words and
music, plays as many as nine instruments in a single
song. Every note he plays accents the painfully beau-
tiful words Bergquist sings. .

Play

The songs seem to be love songs, but they carmot
be categorized as such. A nm—of—the-mill love song

‘ may concern itself with lost love or a desire for love,

but Over the Rhine’s songs are about understanding
love and understanding its place in the world, and
accomplishing that by trying to understand the world
around love as well. _

At times their lyrics are straightforward, such as
in “Give Me Strength,” where Bergquist sings, “I can-
not leave the past alone/I-Ioped that I would never
ﬁnd/All the shit I left behind.” But at times, it seems
like the goal is only to provide a sequence of words
and sounds that inspire and evoke a certain emotion,
suchas in “If Nothing Else,” where Bergquist sings,
“All the stray dog night owl junkies/Orphans
vagabonds/Angels who lost their halos.”

And this is where the dichotomy exists. Films for
Radio are songs that feel like they’ve gotten air time,
but then you see that these songs are just too good.

Detweiler said, “I want to sort of have the free-
dom to experiment as a musician. I’ve always felt that
our music could reach a wide audience. We are

not trying to be too cool for mainstream.”

Listen to the music long enough and read the

, ‘ lyrics, and you begin to see that these are films

‘ converted to a musical medium. The songs talk
about characters that we see so often in the theater,
trying to love and live life and stay connected to their
roots. And these words provide imagery of warm
nights and coal-rnining towns and themes of wanting
the world to just stop while you regain your thoughts.

But still there is a very human and real aspect. In
the opening track, ‘.”I'he World Can Wait,” Bergquist
sings, “I want to feel and then some/I have ﬁve sens-
es/I need thousands more at least.”

Over the Rhine will be playing at Rosebud June
1. "

Back‘ to the future,
Heath Ledger style

~_»*:

The fog rises as night descends
on the Thames; the ﬁve renegades ask
each other how long they’ve been
away from England. For some, eight
years, for others, it’s been 12.
Flashback to an emotional scene
between the pivotal character and his
father. Flash forward to 14th century
England.

And, surprisingly ﬁtting for this
supposed scene from the Middle Ages,
“The Boys Are Back in Town” begins
to play.

I sit on a blanket in the gravel parking lot of the drive-in movie
theater and shake my head.

I stare in wonder at my friends who coerced me into accompa-
nying them to the drive-in to watch heartthrob Heath Ledger in his
summer ﬂick “A Knight’s Tale.”

Just a few days earlier I had been poking fun at this cheesy ﬁlm
while watching the previews on television.

“It sure is good Heath Ledger is in this ﬁlm,” I joked.
“Otherwise who would go see it?”

Apparently I did.

This is not the ﬁrst time this has happened, either. I havea very
dear set of friends that I grew up with. Many of them are currently
home from college for the summer, and we haven’t seen each other
in a long time.

These same friends are notorious for choosing slightly below-
par ﬁlms to view. '

The ﬁrst time I declined a ﬁlm with my friends, it was an oppor-
tunity to see “Baby’s Day Out.” Despite the fact that I wanted to see
my friends, I said no. I could not humiliate myself by going to the
ﬁlm.

Later, I poked fun at my friends for their selections of pre-
dictable romantic comedies and summer blockbusters. I would tear
through movies as we sat watching them, hoping that my friends
would tolerate my hecklirrg.

Last week was no different I wanted to see my friends, but I
really didn’t want to see “A Knight’s Tale.”

I thought about my dilemma.

‘The drive-in is less expensive than a nonnal ﬁlm,” I rational-
ized. “And I really want to see my friends whom I haven’t spent
In ch time with in the last eight mon ,” my internal dialogue con-
tinued '

“And I don’t have anything else to do tonight,” I said to myself.

So I went And heckled. And got caught up in the predictable
plot and blaring anachronisnrs.

When Ledger’s character, Wrlliarrr, sports his shining armor
emblazoned with what bears a striking resemblance to a Nike
swoosh, I blurted, “What’s next, references to Coke and Pepsi at the
royal banquet?”

And when Queen’s “We Are the Champions” plays to celebrate
the underdog’s completely expected victory, Irolled my eyes.

Yes, the extent of my movie snobbery knows no bounds.

But at the end of the ﬁlm, I got up, brushed the dirt oil“ the blan-
kets my friends and I had been sitting on and drove home, apparent-
ly unharmed by the viewing of a sub-par movie.

Pleasant but unchallenging,
singer/songwriter David Mead’s
sophomore release, Mine and Yours,
will not likely make much of a splash
in the music world. As harm-

than a few songs that sound
somewhat like Travis’ _ song
“Driftwood,” Mine and Yours does no

Mead, who rarely, if ever, veers

out of the realm of pop, did well to‘

have his album produced by pop

next track. Mead’s problem
lies not in production, but in writing a
song truly worthy of notice.

Mead’s most viable asset is_ his
vocals, which the album does well to
feature prominently. High but clear
and never off, his voice can at times
sound a bit like the late Jeff Buckley’s.

The lyrical subject matter tends to
be a bit too darling. In “Elodie,” Mead
wonders how he would express his
love for a French actress without
knowing the language, and the thing he

wants to do in “What I Want to Do” is
to “wake up next to you.” Mead ‘does-
n’t write with enough creativity to get
away with this sort of sentimentality.‘
For all of Mead’s faults, Mine and
Yours does have a certain genuine
quality that most pop pieces featured
on mainstream radio these days sorely
lack. This purity has made Mead pop-
ular on the modern folk circuit since
his first record, The,Luxury of Time,
came out in 1999, and he likely will

' remain popular there.

In fact, mainstream radio would be
taking a step in the right direction if it

made some of the album’s better tunes
such as “Standing Here in Front of
Me,”- “Girl on” the Roof”. or the title
track a hit. This is unlikely, though, as
the album lacks a hook to grab the eas-
ily distracted masses,

All in all, Mine and Yours is by no
‘means a terrible album; its fault lies in
its formula of relentless pop that nei-
ther amazes nor offends as good pop
must. Instead-, it is like an album that
mom might bop her head to in the car

kids but looking all the more squar

Is it possible to see that which carmot be
seen, yet exists? After all, how does one
paint or photograph love or sadness in a uni-
versal rnanner that everyone can except? It
can’t be done, and the reason for it is that

everyone experiences the intangible in their"

own unique ways. _

Susan Dunkerley, winner of the Silver
Eye 2001 Fellowship, has created her visu-
al version of thought, emotion and spirit-as
part of her photography exhibition, which is
on display at the Silver Eye Center for
Photography on the South Side until July
28.

The exhibit is exceptional in the sense
that the photography is very unconvention-
al. Objects are sometimes largely out of
focus, and the use of light and shadowing
seem to follow no set, logical pattern. What
you get are photos that go against the grain
of everyday vision. '

“It is seeing ﬂiings in a way that is not
common to our everyday seeing,” said

the Silver Eye Center for Photography.
“[Dunkerley] unlocks our imagination,
making us open to new interpretations.”

Dunkerley’s work provides viewers the
freedom to make their own assessments of
what the photographs represent. They are
very liberating in that they unlock the mind,
giving it free reign to
roam about and
draw all kinds of
connections with
the work -

Highlights of her
display include “Song in My Heart,”
“Journey” and “Lamb, Snail and
Wishbones.” ,

“Mindful” is also a standout, consisting
of various shades. The shades parallel the
human mind in that the mind is always full
of good and bad, things we -want people to
know and things we would never want to be
made public. The shading also relays the
way our mind places more emphasis on cer-
tain things as opposed to others.

Works from the Fel1owship’s 25 honor-
able mentions are on display with those of
Dunkerley’s. Normally, only 10 people are
chosen for the Fe1lowship’s honorable men-
tion. .

“It was a very tough competition this
year,” Benedict-Jones said. “So instead of
picking 10, the jury selected 25.”

One photograph from each honoree is
displayed. ,

All the works inside the Silver Eye
Center are an absolutely beautiful blend of
photography and imagination. In respect to
Dunkerley, words do not do justice to her
award-winning body of work.

More than 1,200 workers have been
vigorously constructing the new North
Shore football stadium over the last year, in
order for it to be completed in time for Pitt’s
home opener on Sept. 1.

Last Thursday, Pitt’s athletic depart-
ment provided more than 300 pizzas for the
workers as athletic director Steve Pederson,
head coach Walt Harris and defensive end
Bryan Knight thanked the workers for their
efforts.

“Coming down here today to thank the
workers and seeing what I haven’t seen in a
couple months is really a thrill,” Harris said.
“I thinkitwouldbe smart if we got ourteam
down here so they could see it too  this is
going to be a tremendous thing for our
team.”

The team closed down Pitt Stadium in
1999 and played last season’s games in
Three Rivers Stadium; neither site exists
today.

The Sept. 1 opener against East
Termessee State will be the first official
football game played in the new stadium.
The new venue will seat 65,000, which is
9,000 more seats than Pitt Stadium held and
will feature a playing ﬁeld that will have a
heated grass surface. ,

The Panthers haven’t played on a home
ﬁeld with grass since 1969. '

. Some of the statistics comparing the

new stadimn to Pitt Stadium our staggering.

The new stadium will have 6,600 club
seats compared to none at Pitt Stadium.
There will be 32 concession stands com-
pared to the old stadium’s 10. Nine retail
stores will be scattered inside the new home
vs. zero in Pitt Stadium, and there will be 50
public restrooms compared to 20 at the old
stadimn. .

Leading Pitt onto the ﬁeld will be
Knight, who racked up 11.5 sacks last sea-
son and has already garnered preseason
attention from many college football
awards and analysts.

“We’re excited but the focus right now
is to get better and work hard,” Knight said.
“It’s up to us to make this our home. The
only way to get the crowd into it is to play
hard and win football games.”

Knight, an all-American candidate,
was recently put on the Lombardi award
watch list. The award is given to the nation’s
top lineman or linebacker.

Last season, wide receiver Antonio
Bryant eamed the Biletnikoﬁ award, which
is handed out to the nation’s top wideout.

Bryant received negative attention
throughout the spring after the team sus-
pended him for missing workouts and ﬁght-
ing with teammates. But Bryant’s actions
will not be detrimental to the team’s suc-
cess, according to Knight.

“Sometimes you have to bring the fam-
ily together when things get a little bit out of
control,” Knight said. “Sometimes you’ll

have little ‘ﬁghts, but that’s what being a ’

family is all about.”

The man who made the decision to
knock down Pitt Stadium and worked out a
deal with the Steelers to share the new sta-
dium is Pederson. His vision is now coming
to fruition, but it wasn’t easy, as Pederson
received plenty of criticism for the decision.

“I didn’t expect that when we started
ﬂie discussion to knock down Pitt Stadium
that everybody thought it was going to be a
great idea because it’s human nature and it’s
hard to envision what’s going to be there
and replace it,” Pederson said.

Pederson said that he knew that in the

long-term, building ﬂie stadium was the
logical thing to do because the program
could not get any better playing in the old
site.

“I didn’t‘think our fans were excited
about settling for an average-to-poor foot-
ball program, and yet I felt like if we stayed
where we were, that’s what would happen,”
he said. “This is the next step for us to
accomplish great things.”

Pitt will host a six- game schedule at the
new stadium, featuring games against such
Big East foes as Virginia Tech, Miami and
Syracuse. ‘

A wild first

The baseball season has been under-
way for just about two months, and there
have been a lot of surprises and unan-
swered questions. And so here are 10 of the
scariest things to happen in baseball this
year.
10. Omar Daal, Philadelphia
Phillies — Daal, the ace for the Phillies, is
6-0 with a 3.57 ERA after going just 4-19
last season with the Diamondbacks and
Phillies. So what happened? Or more
importantly, will it last?

9. Minnesota Twins/Philadelphia
Phillies/Seattle Mariners —- Not one per-
son could possibly have predicted that the
Twins and Phillies would be leading their
respective divisions at the end of May. The
Twins are 32-16 while Philly is 31-18 and
10 games ahead of the National League
Champion New York Mets. Seattle’s ﬁrst-
place standing is not as surprising, but it
wasn’t clear how the team would react to

two months of baseball stories

the loss of its superstar shortstop Alex
Rodriguez. Apparently A-Rod isn’t as hot
as he thinks he is, because the M’s are 37-

those of a tum-back-the-clock game, only
they don’t have a very long history to turn

the same genius who decided that indoor
baseball in Tampa Bay would be appeal-

3. Mike Piazza, New York Mets —
Piazza, who may be the best-hitting catch-
er in the history of the game, has been
going through a slump so‘ horrendous that
his at-bats are more characteristic of Rey
Ordonez’s than his own. Although he
appeared to be breaking out of it over the
past few games, Piazzais hitting just .250
after wavering around the .230 mark. A
lifetime .326 hitter, Piazza will need to go
