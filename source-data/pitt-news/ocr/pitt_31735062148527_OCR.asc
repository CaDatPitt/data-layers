Court. was chosen by 54.6 per cent
of the students; Trees Field by 16.7
per cent; Ruskin ﬁeld by 17.5 per
cent; and 11.2 per cent suggested
holding it at another place clos-e to
the campus.

paid amusements in Ruskin ﬁeld or
somewhere near campus, was ques-
tioned. Percentage in favor of paid
amusements was 42, and 58 per cent
disagreed. ,

Senior Ball were overwhelmingly
defeated with a “nay” vote of 76.6
per cent, while 23.4 per cent favored
a substitute event.

Events more preferable to the un-
dergraduate student body are Car-
nival Night, Interfraternity Sweep-
stakes, Float and ROTC parade, Tea
dance, Informal evening dance, Pitt

events suggested were Kiddies’ day,
tug-of-war between classes, varsity
show and weiner roast.

‘Favor Sweepstakes

Mail lleliveries
To Go on Revised

4 Schedule Today

I Mail deliveries in the Cathedral
will operate on a new schedule ef-
iective“ 'to‘day,’“‘John Weber, sec-
retary of the University, an-
nounces.

Some 43 otﬁces which have secre-
taries will not receive their mail
by the regular twice-a—day delivery
as before. Instead, they will be re-
quired to call for their mail in 167
Cathedral, the University postofﬁce.

All other offices, that is, those
without a secretarial staff, will re-
main on the mailman’s twice-daily
route of delivery in the Cathedral.

The advantage of the plan is that
remaining mail deliveries will be
considerably lighter, as the heavy
mail is eliminated. Distribution is
to be speeded-up, thus reducing
time that the elevators are kept in
service by mail delivery.

Scholars’ Day - - For
Academic Success

Scholastic ability comes out of the darkness of
the registrar's office today into the light of S01-
diers and Sailors Memorial. At tl1e annual Schol-
ars’ Day assembly, those who have done outstand-
ing work in their studies at last get public recog-
nition.

One of the purposes of this assembly is to cor-
rect? the home town notion, probably engendered
by the movies, that people come to college simply
for its social life. That social li_fe at any univer-
sity plays an important role, we readily admit.
But we are still old-fashioned enough to maintain
that the iinportant thing in university life isito get
an education.

Because of the elaborate pattern fof social" life’

and extracurricular activities which has become
so important a part of University affairs, the aca-
demic aspect has received comparatively little pub-
lic notice. ‘

But behind the glamorous pageant of football
games, Soph hops, Cap and Gown shows, and
Spring Festivals lies the daily work of the Uni-
versity—the serious business of spreading knowl-
edge. I ‘

If these things are true, toda.y’s a.ssembly rep-
resents a most important event of the University
calendar. The Scholars’ Day assembly is not only
the one day of the year when an honor roll is an-
nounced, but it is an occasion when academic
awards are presented in persoii.

Scholar or Tuck Shop Tommy, then, the fourth
hour assembly is the place for you today——either
to be recognized for your work, or to recognize
the achievements of others.

N YA Faces
A Budget Cut

Next year's NYA appropriation is scheduled for
a 12 million dollar reduction before Congress now.
This means that approximately 600 University stu-
dents, and thousands of other young people all
over the country, face a reduction in funds toyhelp
them through school next year.

Not only will. this reduction be felt by stu-
dents, but this University, and other schools, which
1'eceive the value of the labor that NYA. workers
perform, willbe forced to curtail some of their
services, or to pay for them from University funds.

There is no apparent reason why the NYA ap-
propriatio_n should be reduced, particularly in the
face of a two billion dollar rise in armament appro-
priations. I A -

Therefore, it
and faculty of this University that the NYA" ap-
propriation be kept at its present level. May we
suggest thatpyou call this to the attention if your

Common Sense
‘Senator’ Okavs
Supreme Court

By Senator Ziskind

(Ed. note; for the Communism controversi , see Sen-
ator’s letter below.) 

Unheralded and free from huge, splashing head-

-lines, the Supreme Court of the United States has be-

come the spearhead of liberalism and progress. Stead-ily,
in decision after decision, its pronouncements hammer
away at crusty and rigid precedent and its acts take on.
a new spirit of enlightenment and human welfare.
The old order gives way to the new. And so it was,
not so long ago, that the Supreme Court spoke the gos-
pel of reaction. It was, you remember, the “corner
stone of the republic.” John W. Davis, John Raskob,

land,iBainbridge Colby_wept for its “traditional safe-

guard” when President Roosevelt sought to make of the
Court what it has at last become today. They shook
their ﬁnger in scorn, warning the New Deal “zealots”
that altering the Court’s makeup was leading America
to the»br-ink of disaster. The big interests of ﬁnance
could not conceive of our three departments of gov-

ernment working in unison, especially when the ﬁrst

two sought reform.

No More Worship

But now, I ask, where are these worshipers of our
Supreme Court to be found? We ﬁnd John W. Davis
rebuking the Court on its “radical” decisions. The
great Constitutionalist lawyers ﬁght to prevent much
of their anti-New Deal litigation from reaching the
High Court. That great Constitutionalist of Constitu-
tionalists, James Hogan, in his retiring speech as Pres-
ident, of the American Bar Association decried the
Court and said that our only hope for preserving “Con-
stitutional” government is with our Congress.

These men lost faith in the Supreme Court because 1

after the election of 1936 the Court heeded the safe
maxim: Aswitch in time saves nine. But more than
that they resented the new blood of Justices Black and
Reed and Frankfurter and Douglas and Murphy. They
resented the Court’s upholding the National Labor Re-

lations Board. Just as they thought they had squelched '

this protector of labor the Court hastened to its rescue.
They resented the Court’s support of government sale
of electricity, of municipal ownership of public utili-
ties, of the Court’s granting wide latitude in outlaw-
ing sweatshops and opening up the way to eliminate
childlabor without passage of the ill-fated amendment.

Hugo “Abe” Black

This is the Court which these exponents of “Con-
stitutionalism” did not want. But it is the Court of
which the American people may be proud. The’ de-
cision, for example, rendered by Hugo Black freeing

three negroes ofgthe charge of murder, overruling all__

the courts of‘ Florida on the ground that police used

force and’ ruthless methods to obtain a “no—defense”

plea, is a new magna charta for the Southern negro.
The American liberal may, through quirk of fate.

lose out in the Executive and Legislative branch of his‘-

Government. He may ﬁnd, some day, these “Consti-
‘tutionalists” riding high in their control. of the -Gov-
ernment. His faith in democracy might waver. But
standing ready to protect him against lmiust infrac-
tions will bc the Supreme Court of the United’ States-
at least for the next twenty years an oasis of liberal
thought.

 Graham Publishes

New Bibliography
I For Journalists

Filling a long-felt need in the
journalism division for a complete
list of books on various phases of
newspaper work, Robert X. Gra-
ham has just published “A Biblio-
graphy in the History and Back-
grounds of Journalism.” ‘

This bibliography includes “his—
tory, biography, analyses of the
press, adventure and reminiscence,
including also authortative beeks
on world affairs by newspaper
workers,” and is the “most com-
plete and up-to-date publication of
its kind.”

Compiled for the use of the stu-
dents in journalism 22 and 32, it is
without annotations of any -kind be-
cause, Mr. Graham says, “I want
the students to really read some of
the books.”

The purpose in publishing the
biblography is to acquaint students
with the background of journalistic
reminescences, adventure, and ex-
periences, stated Mr. Graham.

Monday, March 4., 1940.
from the A  
Sidelines
With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

This is the third in a- series of articles about the Big Ten, its
organization, his-tory, and its relation to the ‘University of Pittsburgh.
=X=  >l< it it

Probably 110 0’fh€1‘ g‘I‘01113 of colleges in the United States has
a more eﬂicient policy of “desubsidi.zat.ion’_’ than the lnte1"collegiate
Conference. v
_Naturally, with college athletics tl1e big business that they
have become in the past 25 years, there will be at least a minimum
of difficulty with the “play for play” system in any sch.ool which
conducts an active athletic program. 9
But the conference has been a consistent leader in the drive to
keep the athl-ete on the same plane as the average student with re-
gard to ﬁnancial aid, and in generalconference schools have been
successful in this attempt. _
 . Since nearly _al.l of the conference schools are state-supported,
the tuition problem is not acute. Aid to athletes is usually in the

form of loans or jobs for which the boys are paid on the same scale .

applying to non-athletes. »

Chicago, with high tuition requirements, offers a large num-
ber of scholarships to students. Only about an eighth of the stu-
dents wh.o received these ‘scholarships, which are based on need
and scholastic ability, were athletes. In addition, eight athletes
were among those who received partial tuition remissions, on the
same grounds as the awarding of scholarships.

Off-Campus Jobs at Minnesota

An extensive‘ loan‘-fund is provided at Chicago for all students
and a placement bureau is maintained to secure jobs for students
while in school. On-campus jobs, held by 103 athletes last year, in-

cluded .N-YA employment and ranged from c0ok’s a.ssist'ant to-

teacher. \Vith.the advantage of location in a large city,_.Cliicago
athletes also found numerous oﬂ:'-campus jobs. _ ‘ 

As at Chicago, a large city, Minneapolis provides many Uni-
versity of Minnesota athletes with oﬁ-campus jobs. Of the nearly
two thousand athletes at Minneso_t.a,,only.61 are employed by the
school, earning an average of about $1.00 a year. While no under-
graduate scholarships exist, a. loan fund is available for students
and nine athletes received such aid last‘ year.

Scholarships at Illinois, most of them covering only the $70 to
$90 tuition and incidental fees, are held by nine per cent of the stu-
dents. Approximately one out of 20 students holding scholarsliips
are athletes. Thirty two athletes received student loans last year,
and 148 held campus jobs, including NYA. work, employment/as
concessions salesmen, maintenance work in the stadium and skating
rink, and policing athletic contests. ‘ ’ ‘ “

State Scholarships at Purdue

Need and high. scholastic average are the requirements for
scholarships at the University of Iowa. Chieﬂy tuition reductions,
these scholarships were held last year by 750 men, 69 of them ath-
letes. Seven other athletes held alumni cash scholarships. Forty-
nine athletes were granted student loans and 134 were assigned
campus jobs by the student employment bureau.

State l.aw.prov.ides.for. a large number of scholarships, consist-
ing chieﬂy of fee reductions and based on scholastic attainment, at

' Purdue university. « Th‘irty—four of the 466, Purdue athletes were

. awarded such scholarsliips, and 11 received loans, but 21.5 were em-

ployed in campus jobs, a fourth of them by the NYA. Off campus
employment is limited mostly to board jobs.

Similar conditions of ﬁnancial aid are to be found at other con- '

ference schools. NYA positions are important at Michigan, legis-
lative scholarships at VVisconsin, on-campus jobs at Indiana, an ex-
tensive loan fund at Northwestern, and off campus work at Ohio

M akes News All-Intramural F ire

By John Chaﬁo _
Fraternity players copped. four of the ﬁve ﬁrst team berths on the all-
intramural basketball team picked by Pitt News writers and the staff
of the intramural department.

The ﬁrst team has plenty of scoring ability as well as polish in ball
handling. In almost every case, the man selected was the leading point
getter of his particular team.

The only independent to break
the fraternity monopoly was Bill
Morton, spark plug of the Phys Ed
Majors.

Phi Kappa, defending intramural
champions, placed two members on
the mythical ﬁve in Jack Glenn and
Tom Halloran. These two players
played an important. part in the
success enjoyed by the Phi Kappas.
Both were consistently high scor-
ers as well as ﬁne ﬁoormen.

High scoring “Wild Bill” Fitchko
represented the,Theta_ Chis and foot-
baller Bobby Thurbon the Phi‘
Gamma Delta quintet on the intra-
mural team. Each was outstand-
ing both in team play,and point
scoring for‘ his respective frater-
nity. ,

Close behind in consideration .
were Joe Kristufek of the New-

Lion Floormen

Trim Pitt, 36-29

Penn Statéi’s basketball team

, gained an even break for the sea-

ison with Pitt Saturday night by

winning 36-29 at State College. The

Panthers had taken an early sea-
son contest,‘ .3l—28. —

It was another case of the Lions’
slick:‘defense' throttling a strong of-
fense. Ed Straloski, Pitt scoring
face, was held to one ﬁeld goal, al-
though ,_Sam-ilvlilanovich and Mel
Port scored 12 and 10 points re-
'spectively.i A J ohnny'Barr’s ﬁve ﬁeld

 

mans and Jack Stetler of the Jerks. I

These, together with Cassiano of
the Phi Kaps,’ Glancy of the Col-
lege Hicks, and Vetter, Theta Chi
forward, make up the second squad.
Cassiano’s outstand_if1‘g_ team play

Great Offensive Fight
F orseen in Encounter

For Intranlural Toga

Two powerful offenses will
clasli this afternoon when the
defending intramural basketball
champions, the Phi Kaps, meet
the high scoring Jerks, new In-
dependent champs.

'I‘he Phi Kaps have turned in’ sev- .

eral excellent performances as
shown by their impressive wins over
Theta Chi, Pi Kappa Alpha, and
S A E. In each case, the margin of
victory was large. S A E was de-
feated by a 38-10 count, the Pi Kap-
pa Alpha ﬁve lost, 43-21,’ and the
Theta Chis were handeda 41-13 set-
back. A 
Jerks Favored

Independent root-ers . will bank
their hopes on the Jerks who have
consistently upset the dope in walk-
ing away with their section of the
independent league. Only the Pitt
Club was a stumbling block.

Pr-e—game dope favors the Jerks,
mainly because of their‘ ﬁne show-
ing in defeating the Newmans re-
cently, 31-11. However, both teams
iave high scoring outﬁts, and any-
thing can and probably will happen.

The Phi Kaps again will be bank-
ing upon the shooting ability of Tom
Hal-loraniand the ﬂoorwork of Jack
Glenn to carry them to a victory.
The pair have been the backbone of
the Phi Kap quintet.

Vince Anania, leading point scorer '

for the independent champs, and
Jack Stetler are expected to con-
tinue their practice of shattering
rival defenses. They should give
the Phi Kaps plenty of trouble.

Oil & Gas Loses '

Frank Goodell, Dick Cassiano, and
Rollo Herron will round out the
Phi Kap roster. The Jerks will
probably also have ‘Ernie Bonelli,
Bob ’Malloy, and Larry Klotz in
their starting lineup. ‘

In a semi—ﬁnal basketball elimin-
ation game, the Jerks defeated the
Oil & Gas ﬁve Thursday by a 34-22
score. Here again Anania and Stet-
ler paced the scorers, with-Anania
having 11 and Stetler eight.

The play up to the half time was
rather sluggish as the Jerks held a
13-8 lead. A fast second half net-
ted the new independent champs 21

. points and a victory.

Spence tallied eight pointsito cop
high scoring honors for the Oil &
Gas quintet.

Pitt’s only other individual place 
winner was high jumper Dave Mc— ’

by clearing the bar at 6 feet 4
inches, half an inch better than
lV.{cDowell’s recent University

The Panther mile relay team of

was fourth as NYU scored a de-
cisive victory in the event.

Ed Burrowes of Princeton cross-
ed the ﬁnish line of the 1000 yard

Varsity ilnfielders, Outfielders

To Hold First Practice Sessions

Opening workouts for varsity
baseball inﬁeld and outﬁeld candi-
dates will be held this week coach
Ralph .Mitterling, varsity diamond
mentor, announced today. \

Inner defense men are to report
to gate 3 of the Stadium at 4:30
o’clock this Wednesday. Outer
gardners will report at the Stadium _
on Friday of this week for their
ﬁrst practice session.

Mitterling stressed the necessity
for all candidates to. secure eligi-
bility cards on the twenty-seventh
.--. - ﬂoor before com-
ing out for the
tune—up work-
outs.

Three - fourths
of last spring’s
inner defense
works will prob-
ably be on the
ﬁring line dur-
ing this cam-
paign. Bob Foli-
art should be
back at the third
base spot, with
basketballer Ed-
die Straloski be-
side him at shortstop.

Al. Holbrook, last year’s keystone
sacker, iscertain to give any con-
tender for the second base berth a
stiff tussle. A lively ﬁght between
a pair of southpaws, courtman Ed
Ziolkowski. and diamond holdover
Lefty D.robnuski, is sure to take
place around the initial hassock.

' Among A the outﬁeld prospects,
several of last year’s fly-Chasers are
sure to ﬁgure prominently on the
1940 edition of the Panther nine.
Returning to the outer pastures are
Al Butch, Frank Goelz, and Ed
Kieper. However, a large number
of other candidates is expected.

Meanwhile, the battery men con-
tinue their workouts in preparation
for the season’s curtain—raiser on
Should the weather im-
prove, Coach Mitterling expects to
take the pitchers and catchers, as
well as the other candidates, out-
doors next week for practice.

Pitt Forum, Theater

Plans Initial Program

Faculty Adviser Reveals ‘Symphonic’ Theme
Of Group’s First All-Student Presentation

A , By Alice Lewis
“Notes on America”-—a poetic symphony of the moods of our
country as expressed through American writers——-will be the first
program of Pitt‘F_orum and Theater, reveals Buell \Vhitehill, as-
sistant professor of English and a faculty adviser to the group.

Purpose ‘of the Forum and
Theater "is to provide lectures,
book reviews, debates, discuss-
ions, poetry readings, and one-
act plays.‘ ’ While no date’ has

been set‘ for its presentation, Mr. _

VVhitehill explained that the pro-

duction is being kept in readiness .

at all times so that it w_ill be avail-
able when there are calls for it.
Symphonic = Narration
The program will be presented in
-the‘-fort, of symphonic narration.
New England will be depicted -in
“moderato” tempo _by James Mc-
Hale, Ed40, who will read poetry
describing the region-'—“cold and
strange like the pine trees””-—as pre-
sented in the poetry of: Robert Frost
and Robert Cofiin. it
The _w'arm and langorous South
will be portrayed by a change to
the graceful “adagio” with John
Cosgrove, Ed40, reading selections
‘from Thomas Wolfe. The sombre
“largo.” tempo will express the
vigor, solidity, and mellowness of.
the Middle VVest, as Esther Mar-
cuson,-’ C431, reads from S'andbur'g’s
“Rootabaga S'tories.”’ ' ‘
American Journey“
. A swift change to “staccato” will
portray the bitter, sharp mood of
the Far West,’ as Fred Robie, Ed41,

brings. to life the cynical poetry of’

Robinson -Jeﬁers. . ,
Closing notes of the symphony
will be rendered in the sprightly
“allegro” tempo, as Marjorie Johns,
C41, reads selections from the urban
poets or 'sophistic‘ates of New York,

as represented by Sara Teasdale‘

and Edna St. Vincent Millay.
The imusical journeyi through

America will be featured by stops

for typical American dishes. At the

first stop-over in__New England, Mc-

Hale 'will lead everyone to “clam
chowder” at..“Moby -Dick’sr.” Ar-
riving in the South, Cosgrove will
invite all to “hominy grits and corn
cakes” a la Thomas Wolfe. _.

4». The narrator, Esther Feinberg,
C42, will give a prologue, intro-

_ “duce ‘characters, and close the liter-

ary symphony. ’

Installs Metal
Testing Machines

If you want to know just how
much strain your automobile axle
can stand or just how hard you have
to pull the wheel before the axle
will snap, saw off a piece and send
it to the University’s metallurgical
department. I L

Two new machines, whose costs
total $3,500, have been installed in
State Hall, making the department
“compare favorably with any in the
world,” according to Dr. G. R.

60,000 pounds. Accurate records
-of all values may be taken from the
attached recording equipment.‘

The impact machine hits the
speciment with terriﬁc force, thus

Study by Dr. Held
Shows NYA Work
No Real Burden

NYA work apparently is not a
burden to students‘ in their academic
work at the University, according
to a study made by Dr. Omar C.
Held, personnel assistant to the
dean of the College.

For his study, which appeared in
a recent issue of School and Socie-
ty, national weekly magazine, Dr.
Held selected 151 full-time NYA
students enrolled in the College “A”
division in 1937-38. The next step
was to match each NYA worker
with a full—time College student
who had the same percentile score
on the freshman psychological ex-
amination and who was in the same
year of school. -

Results. of the comparisons show-
ed that the quality point average of
the NYA group was 1.758, slightly
higher than the average of the con-
trol group-1.726. The difference
of .032 is very slight and not statis-
tically reliable, according to Dr.
Held.

Anniversary with Harmony
Bowman Seeks Unified Action

B y Alumni, Trustees, Faculty

By Neal Russo

Declaring that faculty, Board of
Trustees, and alumni all should
“look alike” in their attitude to-
ward the University's problems,
Chancellor John G. Bowman wel-
comed graduates in his address at
the Charter Day program Friday
night in Foster Memorial. The
Alumni-sponsored event marked
the University’s l5.3rd birthday.

In urging the three groups to
unite forces, Dr. Bowman empha-
sized that “we need in our annual
budget a half-million more to do
the jobs we want to do.” He singled
out the need for additional research

lacilities.
Dr. Bowman then outlined the
University’s entrance standards

and pointed out that over 95 per
cent of the University's 1939 fresh-
men came from the top three-
ﬁfths of their high school classes.

In his welcoming speech, alumni
president John B. Nicklas, Jr., ’22,

I listed his group’s three main ac-

tivities this year as: self-support,
revival of the giving plan, and rep-
resentation on the Board of
Trustees. , 1
Feature of the program was an-
nouncement by Gene Burkhart, ’36,

alumni secretary, of the winner of
the association’s recent contest,
“What is the best single step the
Alumni can take this year?” First
prize of $10 went to Warren
Stroud, ’3l, for his suggestion that
each member of the Association
get two high school graduates to
enroll at the University next fall.

Chairman George Stewart, ’20,
interrupted the all-Pitt program
with the latest in gags. (See C&G
ﬁles).

Harbaugh Miller, ’25, ﬁrst vice-
president “stood—up” several state
senators and representatives whom
he introduced along with Dr. C. L.
Lewis, ’72, oldest living Pitt alum-
nus, and George Bruce Palmer, ’99,
grandson of Robert Bruce, princi-
pal of Pittsburgh Academy in 1820.

Perhaps because it was also their
50th birthday, the lVIen’s Glee Club
