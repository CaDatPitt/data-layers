Office In SU

Political Center Here

by MARY ANN MARKO

The long awaited Citizenship
Information Center (CIC) has
finally arrived, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar announced at
a press conference Wednesday.

Established to foster student in-
volvement in political campaigns.
the CIC is expected to consist of
two offices: one in the Student Un-
ion and one in the Social Science
Building.

By next week University Pro-
vost Dr. Charles Peake. is
scheduled to appoint ‘a CIC Exe-
cutive Committee composed of
five faculty members, three stu-
dents, representatives of the Of-
fice of Governmental Relations.
and the University Council. He
will also select a chairman
from among the five faculty mem-
bers.

After consultation with the
Executive Committee, the Pro-
vost was also to appoint a CIC
executive director. The Execu-
tive Committee will work-closely
with the executive director in the
design, implementation and eval-
uation of the CIC’s program.

Dr. Posvar himself will appoint
a Board of Visitors consisting of
persons outside the University
community to meet periodically
on the invitation of the Executive
Committee to advise on the devel-
opment and operation of the CICS

‘ program.

In speaking of the CIC, Dr. Pos-
var outlined the primary purposes
of the organization: to “facilitate

- the education of students for ef-

fective participation in electoral
politics as citizens; collect and
collate data of the electoral pro-
cesses of local, state, and nation-
al government; facilitate academ-
ic research in the electoral pro-
esses; and function as a clearing-
house for information on electoral
processes.”

The principal functions of the
CIC will be to provide the voting
records of candidates; to contact
candidates to determine their in-
terest in having students partici-
pate in their campaigns; to pro-
vide public statements and posi-
tions of candidates, rules and
laws associated with the elec-

toral process, voter lists and re-
cent election returns; to assist in
the conduct of surveys and other
studies on governmental prob-
lems and to make the information
available, and to cooperate with
and share tasks with similar or-
ganizations at other locations.

The CIC was established in re-
sponse to a University Senate res-
olution passed on June 19. The
original proposal came from the
University‘s Political Science De-
partment after the Kent State
shootings and the U.S. military
move into Cambodia.

In related news. the Chancellor
released guidelines on participa-
tion in political campaigns, in ac-
cordance with those issued by the
Internal Revenue Service. To re-
main a non-profit, tax-exempt in-
stitution, the University must not
intervene in any political cam-
paign on behalf of any candidate
for public office. ‘

. Specifically, the University will
adhere "to the following principles:

1) “Individual members of
the academic community have a
right to participate or not, as they
see fit, in the election process so
long as there is no conflict with
the discharge of their regular du-
ties. However, no individual may
speak or act in the name of the
University in a political cam-
paign;

2) “The academic calendar
may be rearranged, but not short-
ened, for the purpose of permit-
ting members of the academic
community to participate in the
election process;

3) “An organization consisting
of members of the academic com-
munity (other than groups which
have formal responsibilities for
governance, administration, or in-
struction) may adopt resolutions
endorsing or opposing a candi-
date or taking a position on an is-
sue involved in a campaign for
the purpose of assisting or oppos-
ing a candidate. Such resolutions
should clearly indicate that they
do not state a University position;

4) “University funds. facili-
ties, or services may not be used
for any participation or interven-
tion in a political campaign on be-

half of any candidate for public
office. This prohibition includes.
among other things. the publish-
ing or distributing of statements
and the use of University printing
and copying equipment for the re-
production of materials to be used
in a political campaign:

5) "These principles are not in-
tended to inhibit or restrict the
reporting of student involvement
in politics or the expression of
editorial views. identified as such.
in nonpartisan media such as stu-
dent publications and broadcasts."

Commenting on the guidelines,
Dr. Posvar declared, “If a univer-
sity becomes a partisan advocate
in electoral affairs instead of a
forum for ideas, its atmosphere
of free thought and free speech is
jeopardized.”

He added that because the ma-
jority of Pitt students are from
Western Pennsylvania, possibili-
ties for effective political involve-
ment are great. “Political activ-
ity here can be felt," he said. “It
can be significant."

Buildings To Honor

Litchfield,

Former University Chancellor
Edward H. Litchfield and former
Pennsylvania Governor David-L.
Lawrence will be memorialized
in the naming of two Pitt building
complexes.

University Chancellor Wesley
W. Posvar announced that Pitts
unique triple-tower dormitories.
which were opened in August.
1963, will henceforth be known as
the “Edward H. Litchfield Tow-
ers." The classroom and auditori-
um which adjacent Hillman Li-
brary on Forbes Ave. in Oakland
will‘ be'called “David L. Law-
rence Hall." ‘

The names of the buildings
were approved recently by the
University's Trustees. The nam-
ing of the dormitory towers had
been- recommended by the stu-
dent Men‘s Dormitory Council and
Women‘s Housing Board, and by
alumni and faculty groups. The
plan also was endorsed this week
by the Council of the University
Senate.

Chatham Hopes Dampened

naming of these buildings was

EDWARD H. LITCHFIELD TOWERS

Recess Voted Down   

Chatham College students, by a
very slim margin, voted against
instituting a five day election re-
cess, with makeup provisions. in
a referendum Tuesday.

The action could mean that the
voices of Chatham students, who
have generally been in the van-
guard of political activists on 10-
cal campuses, may be somewhat
muted this fall.

It represented a reversal of a
decision four months ago to sus-
pend classes for eight days this
fall to permit Chatham students
to get involved in political cam-
paigns.

The original plan, which includ-
ed no makeup provisions, was
doomed by the Internal Revenue
Service's adoption of guidelines
June 19 which forbid the short-

. ening of an academic calendar by

an educational institution inter-
ested in promoting student politi-
cal activism.

Had Chatham, run the risk of
violating the guidelines, it could
have lost its tax-exempt status.

Chatham students faced two al-
ternatives in the referendum: 1)
to establish a recess and make up
classes on five full Saturdays or
eight Saturday mornings and one
full Saturday; or 2) to abandon
the recess proposal.

The Internal Revenue Service
guidelines which necessitated
such a choice state that “the mere
rearrangement of an academic
calendar for the purpose of per-
mitting students, faculty and
other members of the academic
community to participate in the
election process . . . would not be
deemed intervention or participa-
tion by the institution itself in a
campaign on behalf of a candi-
date.”

However, the guidelines add,
‘fthe case may be different if the
academic calendar, in fact, is

shortened rather than rearranged
for the purpose of permitting stu-
dents, faculty and other members
of the academic community to
participate in the election pro-
cess. In that case the question
might be raised whether releas-

§gturday at 1:30

ing faculty and staff members
from normal duties, with pay, to
participate in the process repre-
sents an indirect participation by
the institution itself in a political
campaign on behalf of a candidate
for public office.”

  Panther 1970 J
Football Begins

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor
Pitt football’s 81st season
will begin tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
at the Stadium as the 16th rank-

ed team in the nation, UCLA, vis-

its the Panthers.

A crowd of approximately 30,-
000 is expected to view the en-
counter, with the opportunity for
more Pitt students to watch the
action than ever before.

The student section has been
expanded from four sections to
six sections (numbered 12-17) as
a result of overflowing turnouts
last fall and a new excitement
surrounding the 1970 Panthers.

“I think there will be student
support,” Athletic Director Casi-
mir Myslinski said. “That's why
we added the sections.”

“I hope we’ll have enough
seats.”

On a second thought, he said,
“I hope we have enough students.”

The new enthusiasm for the
Panthers began last year when
Carl DePasqua led the team to
four victories in ten games in his
first year as head coach. Students
had seen the Cats win only three
games in three years before Be-

DePasqua has a veteran sqad
at hand forhis second year at the

helm, and just about everyone in- .

predicting better things for the
squad this year.

DePasqua himself is known for
hidingoptimism.

“I will say this, however,” he

reluctantly asserts, referring to
,tomorrow’s opener, “If we don’t

give up the easy TD like we did .

last year, I expect it to be a good
football game.’j’_ ' L . .

 Towers, CF Renamed

Governor Lawrence served as a
University trustee from shortly
after his election as mayor of
Pittsburgh in 1945 to his death on

November 21. 1966. at the age -

of 77. As both a public official and
trustee. he urged the extension of
higher educational opportunities
to larger numbers of Pennsyl-
vania citizens. He supported the
University’s physical growth in
Pittsburgh. encouraged its finan-
cial support in Harrisburg before
state-relatedness and played a key
role in bringing about its trans-
formation into a state—related in-
stitution. The building which will
bear his name. formerly known as
the "Common Facilities Build-
ing" because it was designed to
provide classrooms and auditor-
um space for a number of Univer-
sity schools and divisions. was
opened in the spring of 1968. It
was constructed by the General
State Authority for the Univer-
sity. .

In announcing the names, Pitt
Board Chairman William H. Rea
said: “The history of the rapid
advances made by the University
of Pittsburgh from the mid-l940’s
to the mid-1960’s can be attributed
in large part to the achievements
of these two men. Their accom-
plishments for the University
were monumental during their
terms of active service, and seem
even more significant to those of
still associated with the Univer-
sity as time passes. It is fitting,
then, that we honor their memory
in some important way. David L.
Lawrence Hall, which represents
the partnership between the Com-
monwealth and the University, is
an appropriate memorial for the
former Governor, and the tower
dorms, with their advanced and
bold design, symbolize the many
accomplishments of the late Chan-
cellor.”

The name changes are effective
immediately. Formal ceremonies

“dedicating the buildings to the two

men will be held at some future
date. as yet not set.

CASC Undecided 011

English Requirement

by DANA VENTRIGLIA

The main item on the agenda of the College of Arts and Sciences
Council (CASC) was the consideration of the English Departments
proposal to eliminate the freshman English requirement. Following the
Wednesday afternoon meeting. one of the Council members described
the session as "more like a tennis match than a conference."

Dr. Jerome B. Schneewind. dean of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences (CAS). presided over the session which commenced with the pre-
sentation and elaboration of the English Departments proposal by Dr.
Walter Everett. acting chairman of the department.

Dr. Everett stressed the point that the elimination of the require-
ment would by no means curtail the availability of composition and
writing courses. but would in fact improve the level of instruction. He
clarified this statement by referring to the present burden placed on
the department. making it necessary to place a large teaching load on
teaching assistants with little knowledge of freshman composition.

The comments that followed by the Council and visitors ranged
from total acceptance of the proposition to. skepticism. There was a
substantial amount of concern over what would be substituted once the
requirement was expelled. Dr. Everett again emphasized the intent of
the proposal as being improvement of composition oriented courses
rather than elimination.

Amidst the volley of opinions. Dean Schneewind spoke.’ mentioning
problems that could be encountered in the Advising Center in making
individual school requirements known to students planning to enroll in
those schools.

He followed with a proposal for consideration by the Council. urg-
ing, in effect. that the English requirement be dropped; that the Eng-
lish Department be responsible for providing courses in composition
that other schools in the University may require. as well as a program
offering adequate instruction for CAS students.

The proposal never came up for a vote, discussion once again dom-

inating the session. “We don’t have any way of evaluating the effective-
ness of either the present program or future programs,” one member
said, “and I don’t feel very happy about the switch if I have no way of
knowing what the effects of hhe switch will be.”

Gail Hornstein. a student CASC member. compared last years de-
bate eliminating the language requirement with the situation at hand.
noting the lack of adverse effects after the abolition of the requirement.

Yet. no decision was reached. After one and a half hours of discus-
sion and evaluation. Dean Schneewind postponed further discussion un-
til the next meeting.

The remaining portion of the meeting was devoted to consideration
of a request by Dr. Marcia Landy of the English Department to allow
the institution of a blanket credit—no—entry system for two new
courses. The request was briefly reviewed. but due to the lack of time.
was also not settled.

Can all men who wear blue uniforms, carry walkie talkies,
and pistols on their sides, be referred to as “Pigs?”

Some students on hearing the news that the Student Govern-
ment Legal Awareness Committee would be sponsoring a program
in conjunction with campus security next week laughed outright-
ly at the idea, voicing the opinion that there wasn’t anything a
cop could show them. .

Their opinion is true only if they don't want to learn any-
thing from the Campus Police, and they have obviously read
over the point that the program is also designed to allow the sec-
-urity police a chance to better understand the University student,
his ideals and behavior.

Many of the security officers are students too — with many of
the same ideals hopes and fears, concerning humanity as many
of you have. It would be illogical to assume that every man on
the force is not racist or anti—youth, but it’s just as illogical to
assume that every man on the force is, without ever having exper-
ienced any incident with them or communicating with them.

Student Government president Lenny Klavonic said “The
rationale for attempting a program with students and security po-
lice is that existing conditions have forced individuals into a pat-
tern of thought where pre-established ideas prevent communica-
tion and cooperation for mutual advantage."

And what about what a security officer thinks about stu-
dents? Don’t you think there are some officers who think every
student with long hair is a paranoid rhetoric-sputtering mongo-
loid?Can you just sit back and say, “Oh well, let him think what
he wants to?” '

You can’t hate a person merely for his appearance, maybe
if you know his thoughts and opinions on certain subjects, you
can have disdain for him, but you can’t hate him.

Maybe if you do take advantage of the program next week.
you’ll find that many of the campus policemen do fit the stereo-
types of what people think about all cops. But it’s also very likely
that you will find. just the opposite also.

But as long as people keep going along and forming opinions
of people -because of what they represent, we're just getting furth-
er and further away from what is meant by two fingers stuck
into the air in a “V” formation.

Campus policemen are Peace officers. Students are intelligent
individuals seeking to right the systematic things they see as
wrong in the most effective ways they can — True or False? For
those of you who don’t know for sure, next week is a good time
to start finding out. "’

Thousands of Pitt students will trudge up
Cardiac Hill tomorrow to cheer the Panthers on
to victory over U.C.L.A.

Will a comparable number spend an afternoon
or two next month ringing doorbells, talking
with Middle Americans, distributing literature . .
campaigning for candidates for political office?

Probably not.

Students, after all, are little different from
their parents in at least one respect. Just as
Mom and Dad would rather watch a Jason Rob-
ards movie on T.V. than think about perplexing
problems of government, members of “the now
generation” by and large prefer the easy role of
the voyeur to politicking.

If these were ordinary times, student apathy
(or, more precisely, an unwillingness to reorder
priorities) might be condoned and Panther fans
could go their men'y way without troubled con-
sciences. But the rifts which separate Americans
today threaten the very stability of our system-
a system which is held dear by some and despis-
ed by others, but whose fate is important to all.

What’s annoying is that many students “rap”
without end about the unresponsiveness of lead-
ers and institutions and the “absolutely Neander-
thal” values of their elders, even if they rarely
pick up a newspaper or talk with anyone over 21.

Surely, intuition is not so superior to empiri-

cism that the former alone satisfies the eager
minds of the brightest generation ever!

But politiclring should be approached with an
adventurous spirit, not a guilty one.

It represents not only an opportunity to have,
in conjunction with other students, an impact on

STATEMENT FROM R.S.U.

The Revolutionary Socialist Union opposes
the tuition increases at the University which
have practically doubled tuition fees in the past
two years. Members of our organization — along
with great numbers of students here — are pre-
pared to work vigorously to reverse these increas-
es. We believe that such a struggle goes far be-
.yond the immediate self-interest of students,

"involving basic principles of the role of the uni-
versity in society.

The university has a responsibility to serve
the needs of the broader community. Because
the university is a product of the wealth creat-
ed by the labor in society as a whole, the maj-
ority sectors of the population have a right to ex-
pect that they shall benefit from the institution
which they help maintain.

In line with this, it must be argued that ac-
cess to institutions of higher learning is not a
matter of privilege but a matter of right. If the
intellectual tools and training needed for under-
standing and dealing with the complexities of
our society are the possession of an elite minor-
ity, democracy becomes a total sham.

At the same. time, too many pressing social
needs fail to receive the attention they deserve
(or, at best, receive attention “from above" ——
from elite “experts" and bureaucrats).

Medical Example

For example, as Pitt's student medical and
dental associations point out. if “our state and
nation drastically need more health profession-
als, how can one justify making . . . education
even more difficult to obtain?"

The same point could be made concerning
the fields of housing and urban planning, trans-
portation, psychology. Social work, teacher edu-
cation, ecology, the social sciences, etc.

ﬁuidc for ‘Q6 '6’zzt/tolic ’ Studmts

the system, but also to show the critics of youth,
from the Vice-President to the steelworker, that
students are willing to lay their views on the
line in free and cordial debate.

_ To. facilitate student politicking, the admin-
istration has declared a two day election recess
and established a Citizenship Information Cen-
ter.

The recess is slated for November 2 and 3.
By that time, many voters will already have
made up their minds. However, students might
properly regard the two days as a chance to
make up academic work postponed as a result
of political involvement during October.

In agreeing to the recess, the University
Senate recognized that some students will treat
the two days as holidays or extra studying time.
The Senate’s decision reflected confidence in

the maturity and genuine concern of Pitt stu-
dents.

“I don’t naively expect that nearly all young
people will be involved in the political process,”
Chancellor Posvar confided two days ago. Hope-
fully, naivete doesn’t consist in expecting more
than a few dozen Pitt students to give the poli-
tical system a try.

Unfortunately, rationalizations for noninvolve—
ment are likely to be more common this fall
than energetic commitment.

Doesn’t the upset victory of Jesuit priest Ro-
bert Drinan over veteran Congressman Philip
Philbin in the Massachusetts primary Tuesday
give anyone hope? Students helped engineer the
‘dovish father’s triumph.

If Pitt students son’t campaign they deserve
the polarization that won’t somehow go away.
A Panther victory may prove a pyrrhic one to,
everyone in the stands.

Drama?

The dramatic tuition increases at Pitt might
well be related to such elitism, intended to
“weed out” the “less desirable" students. At the
same time, of course, there exist other perfect-
ly reasonable excuses for the tuition rise, pri-
mary among them being the inflation and grow-
ing economic instability stimulated by the war
in Southeast Asia, by rather extravagent mili-
tary spending programs, by the inconsistencies
of Pennsylvania state politics, and by other
converging contradictions of American capitalism.

The tuition increases, irrespective of their
causes, are having the effect of denying ac-
cess to the university many people, and of plac-
ing increasing financial hardships on the re-
maining student population (especially in the
present period of inflation and employment in-
stability).

The tuition increases are reinforcing tenden—_
cies which would make the University an elitist
institution, an institution contributing to the
erosion of democracy, an institution incapable of
dynamically meeting the crises facing our so-
ciety.

Logically, there should be open hearings
(organized, perhaps, by Student Government, in
cooperation with the faculty, interested organi-
zations and ad hoc groups of students, and the or-
ganizations of employees) to seriously examine
questions of university finances and priorities.

If a united and.purposeful coalition concen-
trates its energies and resources on this problem
at our university, it will be possible to lower
tuition and ensure greater democratization (in
the form of useful, socially relevant, quality edu-
cation for increasing numbers of people) at this
University.

Perhaps, the most difficult adjustment
for the individual student to make is the
transition from a Catholic high school to
a large metropolitan university.

In order to render the changeover a
little less painful for the average person,
I have formulated a few simple rules
which may aid in the healthy develop-

ll ' « ment of the neophyte.

FIRST OFF, avoid becoming an ath-
_ eist right away. It is more important that
-one realize the requirements of his back- _

ground and deal with them realistically.
It'is too easy to begin hating before one
understands the target of the animosity.
Wait at least six months.

Secondly, don’t feel self-conscious when
language and dress changes pile on a
right at first. In the University commun-
ity, sister is a term denoting friendship and
cultural unity; it is not the mistake of one
who thinks that you are a nun in modern
dress. The same goes for brother.

Handle with intelligence and sensi-
tivity the question of the clergy in gen-
eral. Curb the desire to call nuns and

, priests by their last names whenever you

 

see them on the street or boarding buses.

‘One must learn to honor the eccentricites

of other persons, even though you may
sometimes, from an unfair prejudice, have
difficulty classifying the religious in that
category.

AS A PRACTICAL matter, begin to
train yourself to sleep in that extra morn-
ing hour that you would characteristically
spend at mass. It is conceivable/that the
time could be spent in scholarly pursuits,
but how masochistic can you get.

In the final “analysis, tend to look at
the Catholic school system as the product

as of a larger misguided educational struc-

   
 

ture. The single act of breaking the stain-
ed glass partition over your mind and mak-
ing a strong, purposeful study of the pro-
cesses behind you will show that public
high schools graduates are not so differ-
ent.

You are not superior because you have
been told for several years that you have
a “better education”. Most probably,

your souls harbor the same self-doubts V

and labor under the same deficiencies as
your secular brothers and sisters.

V I do not write with forked pen: I went
through the same thing myself.

‘‘|mperialism’’
Column By
Cohen HR

To the Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to take exception
to some of the ravings 31' Mr Co-
hen's article in the September 14th
issue of the Pitt News.

Mr. Cohen tosses the Ii.‘-’-Iii un-
perialism around quite ire--1‘ I
would gather from his arc".-'.:l+ t2:.it
a general definition of the word
that he would agree with v.u;-.=sld
be: The domination of one nr.»
tion’s government. people. «.2-i~
or resources for the political.
military, and/or economics Jll‘
vantage of a stronger nation. He
gives the example of the United
States and Southeast Asia. He
goes on to say that imperialism
is the “highest level of the cap-
italist system . . . . “

I would like Mr. Cohen to ex-
plain to me why only capitalists
are imperialists. What does one
say about the Soviet Union when
it determines the non—self-deter-
mination of the people of Czech-
oslovakia‘?

Now all students from the age
of 14 on up know that the Soviet
Union is a Socialist State. Does
Mr. Cohen have a name for so-
cialist imperialism? If not im-
perialism. I would ‘call it aggres-
sion. _ ‘

I would suggest that Mr. Co-
hen reexamine his tenets in the
light of the situation in the real
world and apply his ideals to all
nations. Is he ready to go to
Czechoslovakia and stop imper-
ialism—“by any means neces-
sary?"

Teacher’s

Dress Code‘

Dear Sir,

Would you be kind enough to
publish the “dress code” for uni-
versity students in the Pitt News’?

I realize that there is no dress
code, but I believe some of the
teachers especially in the even-
ing classes are under the impres-
sion that there is one. Why‘?

The other evening I attended
a class and upon leaving the in-

structor stopped me and said.

“can‘t you wear something nic-
er to class?“

He was not kidding. In parti-
cular he remarked on the sandals
I was wearing. First of all. I am
neat. clean. and know how to

dress appropriately. However, I
feel I should be entitled to wear
whatever I please to school, with-
out having an instructor remark
about it. Perhaps some kids can-
not afford to have good clothes
ruined. especially those in Studio
Arts. who then must attend other
classes later in the day. And
again, what gives the instructor
the right to practically demand
that a student dress according to
what the instructor desires?

I feel that mode of dress should
influence no instructor, but that
uuality of work done in the
course be the influential charac-

Ad As Insuﬂ

Dear Mr. Lederman,

As a concerned male student
I wish to express my opposition
to the publication of sexist adver-
tisements in the Pitt News. I am
referring specifically to the ad-
vertisements carried on Page 3 of
the September 14th edition.

This advertisement for the
Wooden Keg, a popular watering
hole on campus states in large
capitals “Get Your Pussy“. and
continuing in much smaller print,
“Galore Flying Circus T-Shirts”.

Our sister students and readers
of this publication merit the re-
spect, not debasement of their
feminine qualities.

I also ask all students to boy-
cott the Wooden Keg until a
suitable apology, to the women
of the community, is suffered
through the Pitt News.

Christmas Off

Dear Editor,

We see as hypocrisy the ex-
travagant celebration of Christ-
mas when there is no peace on
earth. So our group feels it is
time for a Christmas boycott. We
are not going to buy presents
this year, nor are we going to
receive them. We will do with-
out decorations, and may be fast-
ing on Christmas day instead of
feasting.

Instead of spending, we will
work for peace on earth by giv-
ing our money to help make
amends for the suffering we have
caused — such as by financially
adopting a Vietnamese child, and
by giving our time to stop the
war. We are calling for people
to put peace hack in Christmas—-
what better way to observe the
birth of Christ than to bring an
end to the war this year?

We are counting on college
groups to do most of the local
work. Here are some possible
approaches for organizing the
boycott:

1. Contact local clergy — many
should be receptive to taking
commercialism out of Christmas
and putting peace back in.

2. Organize picket lines at
department stores and shopping
centers.

3. Do guerilla theater on the
sidewalk in front of large stores.
Dramatize the horrors of war or
the contradictions in the think-
ing of the military.

1!. Leaflet at high schools.
train stations, churches and shop-
ping centers.

5. Urge fellow students not
to go home for vacation unless
their parents agree to participate
in the boycott.

‘Still Plagues
 Commuter
   Editors, Pitt News:
.. . -In j these days of ecological
 ‘"crisis, it seems absurd to con-
, '."cern oneself with anything as
' trivial as Pitt’s parking dilemma.
For some reason, never the less,
. ,I___ifind .myself concerned, Here
‘ follow some. thoughts on the sit-

 uation, the merits of which I
leave for you to debate.

 The present situation is in-
 _ tolerable and the future looks
" u worse.

. 4. - ‘2.'\The bulk of automotive com-
‘ "muter ‘traffic should be accom-
» modated in a large central park-
""“ing, facility, largely vertically
:\oriented, to be served by frequent
shuttle’ buses; costs can be some-
{"wh_at-defrayed by parking fees,
V and class schedules should be
 more staggered to promote
‘ smoothness of flow

 Use of public transporta-
tion should be subsidized by the
.-‘University as an alternative to
subsidizing more parking spaces;
for example, a student could pay
' the University for a card good
. for unlimited travel on PAT bus-
 es with trips originating or ter-
minating at the University; Pitt
would then pay Pat, subsidizing
"the difference. Pitt should also
encourage Pat to include Oak-
land as a major center of public
‘transportation in their future
‘ planning. _
y. 4. Vastly more parking spaces
~ _ should be made available for two-
wheeled vehicles; their lower cost
- and the convenience of being
able, to park at classroom build-
ings will encourage a switch to
these vehicles for all but the
‘I roughest weather. Four motorcy-
cles, or six bicycles, can be park-
 ed in the space now occupied by
one car; in addition, there exist
, many odd corners in lots all over
campus which need only be de-
'  signated as cycle parking areas
 to add to Pitt’s capacity without
building a single new lot.

1 5.‘All commuters should be
’ registered as a precondition to
A being . considered for parking
space assignment; a computer
. ‘ may then be used to organize ef-

 ficient car pools, and the space
y may be assigned to the group
. rather than the individual; this
 is especially true for employees
» working regular hours.

, 6. Undergraduates should not
ﬁne considered for automotive
-; parking space unless they derive
substantial support from work
‘ for which they need a car. Grad-
J uate students, resident on Univer-
_ .sity‘ property, should be subject
- to the same restrictions. The spir-
pit‘ of these limitations is that Pitt
should subsidize only those who
.' genuinely need the space.

L ‘7. Cycle spaces should be on

a ‘grab-first basis and never as-
. signed; as part of the new park-
ing facility, an indoor, heated
area for winter storage of cycles
should be provided. Cycle spa-
A ces should grace each building.

 8. Pitt police parking tickets

should carry a fine; otherwise
they have to resort to towing ve-
A‘ hicles away.

9. Pressure should be put on
the city to repave the streets on
_ the University campus.

10. A cycle club should be or-
ganizedto facilitate the acquisi-
tion by large numbers of people
. of athenski-lls necessary’ to pur-

well as comfortably operate two
wheeled vehicles under all wea-
ther conditions.

Recreational events such as
motorcycle hill climbs, hare
scrambles, short track races,
group tours, and group trailing
meets should also be sponsored to
popularize this mode of trans-
portation, which has been the
backbone of European transpor-
tation systems for many years.

11. The University should
substantially subsidize research
to develop pollution-free vehi-
cles, including cycles, and con-
sider legislation and progress
in this field carefully as an aid
to planning for the future.

Such a concerted combination
attack, in my estimation, will
amply repay us for the invest-
meht it calls for; I am convinc-

ed we cannot continue to mud- .

“Negro” Edit
Misinformation

Editor, The Pitt News:

I read the editorial “What’s
In A Name? Maybe Life” while
I was in the library, and the in-
teresting allegations in it about
the term “Negro” prompted me
to check in Spanish dictionaries.

First I looked up “Negro” in
the English side of Edwin B.
William’s Dictionary. Spanish
and English. The Spanish word
is given as “negro.” In the Span-
ish side, too,» “Negro” is given,
among other meanings, as the
translation for “negro.” The Span-
ish word “moreno” is given as

*“brown, dark brown, dark-com-

plexioned (r.-all.) colored
person; (Am.) mulatto. . . ”

The Diccionario de la Lengua
Espanola, of the Spanish Aca-
demy puts it even more restrict-
ively as “Hablando del color del
cuerpo, el menos claro en la raza
blanca.” This latter would mean
that “moreno” would signify a
dark member of the white race.

Mr. Ferrakon, it would seem,
was quite wrong in saying that
the Spanish word “negro” referr-
ed only to inanimate objects. It
only shows that the Spaniards

have retained the differentiation ‘

between “Negro” and “colored”,
now largely lost in American En-
glish.

As for the claim that “negro”
goes back to the Latin “necro-”,
this would appear to be complete
balderdash. “Negro” goes back to
the Latin “niger, nigra”, mean-
ing “black.” Interestingly en-
ough, “moreno” can be traced

back to “moro”, a Moor, and S

“moro” back to the Greek “mau-
ros’ ’—also meaning “black.”

There may ultimately exist a
connection between Latin “nig-
er” and Greek “nekros”, mean-
ing “dead”, or, for that matter,
between the Greek “mauros”
and the Latin “mors”, meaning
“death”, but such a connection
would go too far back into the
history of Indo-European lang-
uages to be relevant to black
people.

Blackness and death have
long been connected in popular
imaginery — at least in Western
culture — and quite probably this
connotation goes back even fur-
ther than contacts between white
and black races. The effect this
connotation has on the white
man in his relationship to Neg-
ros —— if any — isa moot question

 

In passing, I do wish that the
editorial writers of my genera-
tion would spend more time in
research and less in rumination.
I fear that it is a general sick-
ness of our times to rush into
emotional causes and their pub-
lic expression without really
knowing what is going on.

If I could assign a punish-
ment to Mr. Ferrakon and Mr.
Marbury for their all-too—hasty
conviction that the white man
has saddled them with something
unseeming in the name “Neg-
ro”, I would make them look up
the origin of the word “Cauca-
sian” and tell us if they think
we whites got any better a deal.

Re-hit
(in Opinion  

To The Editor:
The Pitt News

Dear Mr. Marbury:

In your column reviewing the
address by Black Muslim Min-
ister Louis Ferrakon The Pitt
News, Monday, September 14,
1970, p. 4), you have presented
some misinformation which I
should like to correct. The Eng-
lish word Negro does not come
from the Greek (not Latin) word
for “death,” but from the Spanish
and/or Portuguese word negro,
meaning “black.”

This word is derived from the
masculine accusative case of the
Latin word for “black”: nigrnm,
from niger (from which, inciden-
tally, also come Niger Riger and
Nigeria).

The second error which needs
to be corrected is your (and Mr.
Ferrakon’s) belief that the Span-
ish word negro is used only in
reference to inanimate objects.

The fact that Spanish has the
word moreno (brown, dark, bru-
nette) can be attributed to the
contact of the Spaniards with the
Moors, who had darker skins than
their own moreno being the ad-
jective derived from the noun
meaning Moor).

Both words are used in Spanish
to refer to people, as well as to
things; moreno refers to people
with hair and complexion chest-
nut-colored or darker, while ne-
gro refers specifically to people
of very dark hair and complex-
ion who are descendents of the
Negroid peoples of Africa or Aus-
tralia.

Dear Don,

Congratulations on a real news-
paper, the Pitt News of Septem-
ber 11.

It is a real pleasure to be able
to read and to learn University
news, and not the childish, parti-
san, pseudo-clever writing we

sometimes get. { "
Best wishes for every success.

Back From Hell

“Just A Prglonged Death’ Alternatives To Users,‘-:‘t~l:

by VIRGINIA COOK
“What was it like being on
drugs?"
"Itwashell."

"Do you think you can kick
the drug habit?“.

"Ihave to."
“Why‘?“
“If I don't. I‘m dead."

Lets call him Frank. He's a
resident of Halfway House. the
rehabilitation center of Hope for
the Addict, Inc. He‘s been to
Hell: now he‘s on the way back.

Frank’s story begins back in
the early fifties when he was still
in junior high school. The Sup-
reme Court had just handed down
it’s decision on school desegre-
gation, but still, there wasn't
much of a future in books for a
black kid in Homewood. So Frank
cut a lot of classes.

From junior high. Frank went I
. to Westinghouse High School.

Books still didn‘t mean too much.
and Frank continued to get into
trouble. In 1957 he was expelled
from Westinghouse-a high school
dropout with an eleventh grade
education.

..It didn't really matter to Frank
that Westinghouse didn‘t want
him. The “Corsairs". a Home-
wood—East Liberty gang did. The
“Corsairs” gave him the sense of
belonging that every teenager

needs. There were parties. soft-
ball and football games.

In 1959, when Frank was 19,
he and a few friends robbed a
drug store of its narcotic supply.
Frank's friends could “shoot”
(inject heroin), and when he
seemed curious, they “shot” him.
They judged his dosage wrong,

so this experience with the drug,

was a nightmare. Frank decided
his curiosity had been satisfied
and that now he knew to avoid it.

Apprehended for that robbery.
Frank was sentenced to from 11-
24 months in the Allegheny Coun-
ty Workhouse. He was released
on parole after 12 months.

Outside. however. it was hard
getting a job because of his re-
cord.

In 1963 he was convicted of
armed robbery and served a two
year sentence.

He was released in 1965. Again,
it was the same story. All the
job applications asked: “Have
you ever been convicted of a
crime?” Moreover, he was liv-
ing in a drug-saturated environ-
ment. His friends used drugs;
many of them sold drugs.

Frank had tried a lot of things
to fill the voids in his life. First
it was alcohol, then reefers. on
to drinking cough syrup and fin-
ally. in 1966. at the age of 26.
heroin addiction — Hell started.

A typical day in Franks life
for three and one half years went
like this: up at 7 a.m.. “shoot"
and “get off“ (get under the in-
fluence of the drug). Then it
was out on the street to make
some arrangements to get the
needed money for the next fix.
Nine out of ten times these mon-

ey-making schemes were illegal.
Get the money.

Go buy the fix from the pusher.
Go home. Shoot up. Go back out
on the street. Make arrangements
to get more money. Go get a fix.
Shoot up. Around two o’clock,
get drowsy and sleep ’til seven
p.m. Then the cycle begins again
until sleep is induced again.

Day in and day out Hell. for
three and one-half years.

In 1969 Frank was arrested for
possession of narcotics. He was
given a three year probation and
went right back to drugs. Fin-
ally. an ex-addict friend recom-
mended Halfway House to him.
In February. when we were stu-
dying for midterms. Frank was
going through "cold turkey".
withdrawal. That was worse
than Hell: “narcotic is a pro-
longed death; if you don't have
it: you cry."

Frank is still in the program at
Halfway House. He isn't rehabi-
litated yet. He has to find a
whole new environment; he has
to make a whole new circle of
friends. He has to find a job.

Right now Frank's job is help-
ing Hope for the Addict and the
Pittsburgh Jaycees in Project
D.A.R.T. (Drug Abuse Rally To-
gether), a program designed to
inform the public about drug
abuse. He'll be at the rally at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall tonight at 8 P.M. to tell
kids not to let their curiosity
about drugs get the better of
them. Experimenters seem to
think that they can never be-
come addicted. But as Frank's
experienced voice says. “If
you play with fire. you get hurt."

And Hell hurts.

  Students “Self-Design
  F ilm-making Major

by STEVE LUBETSKY

....Student film-makers, Ken Love and Chuck Goldstone conclude
that the best path to success is through experience. Resigned to the
absence of a department of film production and communications at
the University, they were forced to pursue their studies themselves.

Together for only a few short weeks, Love and Goldstone had
been working individually for the past year. They joined forces be-
cause of the lack of facilities on campus, and also because it is more

economically feasible together.
A ten-minute color—sound film,
they explained, could cost as
much as $1300 to produce.

Goldstone, a senior who maj-
ored originally in Psychology,
now carries a self-designed ma-
jor in Film-making and Televi-

‘sion.\, Much of his training has
been obtained’ through his ob-

servations when working with
radio stations WPGH and
WEDO, and television outlet
WQED.

The film maker explaining
why he decided to change his
course of study related that -he
enjoys making films because he
“can do things with film that
can’t be done with other media.”
He claims that he grew disen-
chanted with Psychology be-
cause “I couldn’t see myself

‘standing in front of a Skinner

Box and breaking out in a cold
sweat when the rat salivates.”

Co-producer Ken Love is a
senior majoring in Economics.
His training includes a course
taken this summer at the Wash-
ington University School of Film
Production.

Using 16 millimeter equipment,
the team ‘of Love and Goldstone
produces films of all sorts, rang-
ing from traditional to experi-
mental. This, they insist, provid-
es them with “as much experi-
ence as possible.” One project
they are considering is a docu-
mentary of their home, the In-
ter-Cultural House. Presently,
the two produce multimedia
shows in Dr. Stanley Shostak’s
Live Sciences course.

Goldstone, discussing film-
making procedures. said that he
knows “what the picture looks
like before shooting. It‘s a mat-
ter of transforming a mental
image into a projectrd one.“

The two seniors remarked
that they “are still exploring and
learning the techniques of the
craft.“ Their plans for the fu-
ture include doing post-graduate
work, in an effort to further es-
tablish themselves as competent
producers.

stronger measures," declared Paul
Hensler. President of the Com-
muter Association at the groups
first meeting of the term Tues-
day. “We will build a bus shel-
ter ourselves. out of old lumber
and messy cardboard and erect
it on the lawn of the Student
Union as a monument to the ad-
ministration.“

Hensler says that bus shelters
are not the only area in which
the administration has been re-

practice field for parking“. he
said. “Now they‘re taking that

there appeared a picture in The
Pitt News of an empty parking
lot. allegingthat students don't
use parking when it is provid-
ed. That is rediculous when you
consider the parking situation in
Oakland.

_ "On the other hand." he said. A

“the administration seems to be
sympathetic. but it has a limit-
ed number of resources and the
squakiest wheel is always the
one that gets the grease."

“Most of the commuters’ pro-
blems are minor irritations, prob-
lems of extra meals, nowhere to
go between classes, etc., which
can be overcome,” admitted Hen-
sler, “but they add up and tend
to prevent commuters from tak-
ing an active part in campus life.

So many students come here to
classes and go home and never
really find out what a university
is all about. Most commuters,
as it now stands, might as well
stay home and take correspond-
ence courses.”

The Commuter Association
plans a commuter newspaper to
be issued three to four times a
term. Also, from the information
gleaned from the cards sent with
the invoices. they plan to inves-
tigate interest in a lunch ticket
plan and work with the Port
Authority for more convenient
bus schedules. They will also at-
tempt to find out exactly how
many commuters there are in
the University. Up to now. no
one has done more than esti-
mate.

Chatham To Disregard SAT’s

by POHLA SMITH

Chatham College startled area
students last Friday by annouc-
ing that applicants to the College
during the next three years will
not be required to take the Schol-
astic Aptitude Tests (SAT’s).

Prospective students will be
chosen for admission on the bases
of their high school records. rec-
ommendations by high school
teachers and guidance counselors.
and interviews with admission

. personnel.

In an interview with The Pitt
News, Miss Peggy Donaldson. di-
rector of admissions at Chatham
College. explained the reasons
behind their three-year experi-
ment.

“We (the faculty) dropped the
requirement of SAT’s because we
felt that too much emphasis was
being put on the tests, not by col-
leges, but by students, parents,
and teachers. We feel emphasis

should be on the student's high
school record.” Though she ad-
mitted SAT’s can be helpful, she
said, “They are not essential.”

(Ed Harper, assistant admissions
director at the University, explain-
ed that Pitt will continue its present
policy of requiring students to take
SAT’s. Harper added that Pitt likes
to use college board scores because
“they offer us an equalizing fac-
tor. The scores show how the stu-
dent compares to a national norm.”i

Miss Donaldson foresees one
problem with the three-year ex-
periment. Many high schools are
changing from letter grade sys-
tems to pass-fail systems. Be-
cause a great deal of the admis-
sions office's decision rests on a
students grades. Chatham may
have to return to using college
board scores if the pass-fail sys-
tem gains wider acceptance in
high schools.

Asked what the public's reac-
tions to the decision have been.
Miss Donaldson responded. "It's
too soon to tell. Only one student
has phoned in and she was delight-
ed." The director added that she
doesn't know if other colleges will
decide to also drop college board
requirements. At this time only
one other college has made a simi-
lar decision. Bowdoin College in
Maine last year became the first
school to drop SAT requirements.

Chatham’s decision to drop col-
lege board requirements follows
the initiation of a new academic
program. The program is design-
ed to give the student more free-
dom in designing her course of
study.

The new program requires a
student to complete 34 courses.
including two Interim sessions
and an individual study project.
the Tutorial. which is designed by
the student and a faculty member.

In conjunction with the new re-
quirements, Chatham has design-
ed a new calendar. It consists of
two 14 week terms and an interim
period of four weeks. The student
normally will take four courses
each term and one course during
the interim.

Chatham students are able to
choose from several options in
structuring ‘their educational ex-
periences: the traditional depart-
mental major, the concentration
of study in two or more related
departments or the study of a sin-
gle problem or topic. A student
also may choose not to major but
to design with her faculty advisor
an alternative program.

A salt shaker full of pure heroin
is worth $6-8000 in the hands of a
street pusher.

The rally will also be concern-
ed with rehabilitation attempts
to control and correct drug abuse.
Allegheny County hospitals now

offer 14 beds to drug addicts.

This is inadequate for Allegheny
County's estimated 3,000 addicts.
Most hospital programs use the
drug methadone, a narcotic sub-
stituted for heroin. Halfway
House. the rehabilation center
of Hope for the Addict, Inc.,
also uses methadone.

Because methadone does have
addicting potentials, it is often
referred to as legalized addiction.
But methadone rehabilitation dose
take the addict off the streets,
and insures safe dosage.

The drug abuse rally is a first
shot. Since the public — espe-
cially parents and teachers — are
the main focus for this informa-
tion. the Jaycees are hoping the
next step can be the establish-
ment of drug awareness and pre-
vention classes.

lose a leg. Play music. If he lost
his sight he could turn to writ-
ing. If he failed somehow in one
area, there would always be an-
other to turn to. As he reflected
on the pain of these early years,
he commented that they would
be worthwhile if only his work
could somehow help to end the
hatred, bigotry, andwar so pre-
emminent in our society.

Turning to the portion of the
audience who worked in the arts
themselves. he gave his sugges-
tions for success, the same that
he gives to young people com-
ing to New York to establish
themselves in an artistice car-
eer. His three principles were to
learn the craft so well that “it
is a natural extension”. to con-
stantly find new ways to utilize
your career. and to experiment.
He also warned against taking
the easy way out. Briefly. he
said not to follow the rules.

In his own works he has seem-
ed to flaunt all the rules. For ex-
ample. he has dared to twirl the
camera when told to keep it still.
He shot into the sun against the
advice of experts. In the field of
music. he has written chords,
which to be correctly executed
must be struck by the fist. much
to the chagrin of one lady com-
poser with whom he worked.
“But." he cautioned, “just to be
wild is not the thing. It must be
tempered with intelligence and
taste."

Parks movingly described his
affiliation with some ghetto fam-
ilies he tried to aid. He convey-
ed the trust one family had in
him by saying that he had been
allowed to shoot pictures of
their family fight, where the an-
gered wife scalded her husband
with a hot mixture of water and
honey. He recalled trying to help
them to their feet by giving them
a new home far from the ghetto,
but related the tragic end. Com-
ing home drunk one evening, the
father burned the house to the
ground, killing his son and him-
self. The daughter soon began to
walk the streets, and the other
son turned to dope. The mother,
alone, found herself'back in the
ghetto at Christmastime.

He thought back to other stor-
ies he had done in his life. such
as those on important public fig-
ures like Cassius Clay. Martin
Luther King. and Malcolm X. He
wondered what would have hap-
pened if he had done those stor-
ies on white people. He realized
how he perhaps had touched these
peoples‘ lives. and then asked
the audience. "Do you want me
to do a story on you?"

Parks then presented his poems
“Peace Escapes" and “Martyr-
dom at Kent State" along with
several other selections. In re-
spect to these. he urged that "we
must not make the error of lim-
iting our creativity. We must

 

 -Artist Exhibits Dynamism

bring new meaning in" the fullest
and broadest extent to inspire
men to lasting peace.“

Following the poetry, a series
of his still photography set to
music was presented. His photo-
graphy showed how well he had
adhered to his own advice by dar-
ing to be tastefully different.
Flaming sunsets contrasted with
the reality of the ghetto situation
were shown. Soft colors and seen-
ery that can only be found in
Camelot or a dream was caught
on film. Originality threaded it-
self through this series, showing

the audience one breathtaking

scenario after another.

It was a certainty that Gordon
Parks brought great pride to his
race that evening, and to many
he reached his goal to inspire
men. It is a rare artist who con-
tributes a binding force appli-
cable to all men. One such man
is Gordon Parks, a man who has
dared to be different.

and faculty members registered
to vote in the upcoming Novem-

Mrs. Brandt, head of the dele-

local campuses, reported that re-

good, considering the number of
students eligible and the possi-
bility that many have already
registered. ‘

She added that although the
registration deadline was Sept.

have already registered at home
can still request absentee ballots
by contacting their local Boards

ed that students registering un-

adopted. anyone over 19 would

by ED CONLEY
. _  Spar  5§d§.~‘-or _
Jeff Zonis was a Pitt clieerieaiier last year. Novrs he's tak-

   

ing graduate courses at the University, forgetting about leading’

chants. You wouldn’t have believed it this summer, though,

Jeffrey visited the sports office often, inquiring about the
1970 Panthers. He steadily gained enthusiasm for the team
through the summer months. But, then again, his interest didn’t
begin at zero. -

“I’ve been psyched up about the UCLA game since Penn
State,” he kept saying. . .and still says.

“Penn state” is a refer. ‘gllllllllillllllllllllIllllIllllllllllllilllllllllllilllllllllll
ence to Pitt's 27-7 loss to 3
the Nittany Lions in the final
game last fall. But what was
that Jeff said? Psyched up?

I don’t think I’ve I’ve ever
been psyched up about a foot-
ball game. I don’t think I am
now. But just the other day
someone on the football team said he was psyched up about to-
morrow’s Uclan game. Could it be contagious‘-’

Interrupting a conversation between Panther split end
Steve Moyer and Pitt News sports writer Jerry Myers (former
roommates), I asked Moyer about his thoughts on the upcoming
game.

“I’m really psyched up,” he answered, matter of factly.

Psyched up?

“S'ure,,I’m psyched up,” he retorted. Everybody is——at least
a little. .  .I’m kinda glad UCLA beat Oregon State (last week).
this way they’ll be pretty high and we will shoot them down.”

A quick check discovered that Moyer did say that the Panth-
ers WILL heat UCLA, er shoot them down. ~

That must be what it means to be psyched up about a game.
or could “being psyched" be another way of describing the in-
creased chatter at the latest Panther practices? Or maybe it’s
something like coaches running pass patterns for pleasure after
their players have left the drills? That's what a few of the Pan-
ther assistants did after Wednesdays session.

ack? UCLA

by BILL NAAB
Associate Sports Editor

The l*’.’-.-.-Ii{h€I‘S hope to exert. enough pressure to-
morrow afternoon to tiiirs"-w UCLA off balance.

“The;-"re (UCLA) a balanced team," Panther
football (-:U.9lCh Curl De?-‘asqua commented. “Every
coach wants a balances} attack. It.’s rought to pre-
pare for, defensively.’

The Bruins’ balance stumpe-.i Oregon State last
week. A rival not f)l').i_‘-_:‘ must plot against one of the
nation's premier quark;-rbur:ks.i Dennis Dummit,
but must also cozvégexici  ill) a piinishing rus:=Eiig at-
task. i

A wee.-‘.. ago, The Bruins achieved 1:‘: first
downs along the ground and 11 through the air. The
bath:-arrie..r.-.. gained 289 of the 439 net yards while
Dammit perfectly cum pl-emented his ground game.

Panthe; defensive back Andy Mollura realizes
the difficulty of tomorrow's task, and mentions that
"possibly the most important factor could be our
defensive linemen's ability to put a hard rush on
Dummit. If they can pressure him, it’ll make my
job alot easier. They can throw-off his accuracy."

The Panther coaching staff has indicated that
l_.lUT‘—ll'lllt must be hairassed in order to contain the
[iclan attack. llowev-er, DePasqua hasn’t C~f-rnmit-
ta -d himseif to a blitzing defense

“Often, a blitz can hurt a team," DePasqua ex-
plained. “Of course, the blitz can be a great help
too. The defensive rush depends on many things,
blocking patterns for (me. It’s important for the de-
fensive liaemen to pickup the blocking patterns so
that someone can be free. -to get -:9 the passer."

Every opponent attempts to thwart Dennis Dum-
mit"s accuracy, how'ev»:v:. Oregon State directed its
defense toward miizzling; the pre-season All—Amer-
ica choice. Yet, he 5-ompkated 13 of 29 tosses.

His coach. Tommy Prothro said, “He is the best
passer I've ever had He is also superior to the
Dummit. oi" last year.’ Last year, Dummit. crashed
seven UCL \ passing records.

Panther quaterbacks (John Hogan and Dave
Havern-—i't"s anybody’s guessas to who'll see the
most action), meanwhile, may be satisfied to record

 

lst Test

Defensively, the Bruins are rated strongest in

- the secondary. Heading the five lettermen at the

important cornerback and safety spots are two reg-
ulars, All-Coast Ron Carver and Doug Huff.

In addition, according to assistant Panther
coach Bill Quinter's reports, “Allan Ellis is the fin-
est prospect in the UCLA defensive backfield.” He
starred at defensive back on last year’s freshman
squad.

Quinter also maintains that the Bruins’ replace-
ment for Mike (Cat) Ballow at middle linebacker is
just as rugged as the graduated all-star performer.

“Greg Snyder is a tough kid. He is as tough as
Ballow, although hes not as rangy,” Quinter stated.
“No one is going to have an easy time with the
UCLA defense. "

" Lack Of 'Spirit’ As

Team’s Top Stopper

by STEVE ZYCH

Jesus (Chu Cho) Valencia of Bogota, Colombia, summed up the
feelings of all five (Valencia, Jorge Guiterrez, Auggie Roland, Fernan-
do Carriquiry, and Jorge Maurer) of the soccer team’s Latin American
players’ feelings about America when he said: “I like it very much in
America.” However, each of them had to adjust to a new way of life

and each had his own problems.

For some it was the language barrier, while others, like Chu Cho.

had to cope‘ with an entirely new
educational system.

“In my country (Colombia) we

. had no choice in high school. Here

I could choose my subject. This
was new to me.”

All five plan to go back to their
respective countries upon grad-
uation. Chu Cho, Auggie, and
Jorge Guiterrez are in Liberal

§Arts while the two cousins from

Peru, Fernando and Jorge, are in
the School of Engineering.

All of them, however, had to get
adjusted -to the different style of
soccer played in this country. For
Auggie (a native of Chile) a big
difference is “the stress on team-
work in this country versus an ac-
cent on individual skills in Latin
America. I have noticed that most
American coaches have a football
mentality and try to make soc-
cer players function like ma-
chines instead of letting them de-
velop their skills as unique, crea-
tive individuals.”

Jorge, Maurer pointed out the

‘ gather poor quality of U. S.

goalies. ‘They are afraid to dive
and throw themselves at the ball.”
His cousin, Fernando, also noted
the differences in formations. “In
Peru wevuse mostly a 3-3-4 or 4-2-

4. Here I have to get used to a 5-3-

2 and a 4-3-3. It is a new experi-
ence for me."

Jorge Guiterrez of Mexico was
struck by the lack of basic skills
among American players, espe-
cially the defense.

“Because of their lack of per-
sonal skills they resort to dirty
play to stop another player,” he
says, “This is how I lost my front
two teeth several years ago in
California during a high school
soccer match.” The little Mexi-
can was also disturbed by “the
overstress on conditioning and
tactics by American coaches who
at the same time spend far too
little time developing the basic
skills.” ‘

But the biggest difference noted
by all was the lack of enthusiasm
and “spirit” among the American
soccer players. “You have to like
soccer to play it well. The soccer
players in this country seem to
lack this spirit and" pride in them-
selves and their team,” stated the
outspoken halfback Auggie Ro-
land who may be out for the sea-
son due to torn ligaments which
he attributed to “dirty play” in
an early team scrimmage this
season.

 Kickers Battle Akron
Before Sellout Crowd

by MIKE MILLER

Somebody up there likes Pitt
soccer coach Leo Bemis. The evi-
dence of this can be found in the
starting line—up for tomorrow’s
soccer match with the University
of Akron.

John White, last season’s lead-
ing scorer, has returned to the
team after giving up soccer in
favor of football. White has de-
cided to concentrate his energies
on soccer but he will kick for the
Panther gridders when the sched-
ules do not conflict.

Bemis’ second heaven—sent
comes in the form of Conference
“Tsima” Lekoma, leading scorer
in ’68, who missed last season
due to injuries.

Bemis has high hopes for his
players.

“White has all of the tools to do
a great job,” said the coach. “He
is the fastest man on the team. He
has a great outside, long shot with
either foot and he has good ball
control."

' Bemis plans on using White in
at center halfback with Tony Nich-
olakopoulous and Lou Vida.

For the Akron match, Bemis
states, “I need the best possible
halfback line. With Gus Theofilos
and Tsima Lekoma we have
enough scoring ability.”

The hooters will be part of an
annual soccer-football double
header in the “Rubber Bowl.”
The match will be played in the
Akron Goodyear Stadium before
a sell out crowd of 32,000 fans.

Akron finished last season with
an 8-4 record. They were 6-1 in the
Ohio Conference. They lost a 1-0
match to Cleveland State, the con-
ference’s NCAA representative.
Bemis, therefore, rates them as
the second best team in the Ohio
conference.

Both teams have 15 returning
lettermen. After 12 matches with
Akron the teams have split 6-6.

The “Rubber Bowl” game was
originated in the early 1950’s as
an advertising gimmick by Acme
Supermarkets. The purchase of a
certain amount of groceries net-
ted the purchaser a ticket at re-
duced rates.

The game has since become an
annual sell out.

Booters At ’70
Opener In Akron

Striving ‘to better their .500
mark of last year the JV hooters
begin their regular season tomor-
row against the Akron Zips at 1
p.m. in the Akron Rubber Bowl.
This will be the cub’s toughest op-
ponent this season. Varsity coach
Leo Bemis rates them as “very
tough.” The JV team is coached
two transfer students: Kevin
Crowley from West Point and lo-
cal boy Joe Luxbacher from West

“Wait till we come to Pitt,”

well, especially in the doubles

~matches. This year you seem to
‘ ’ have better players and more peo-
 ple going out for the sport.“

Peggy Johnston, C-MU's num-
ber one player, defeated Joann
A Kotjan in the only match Pitt lost.

 “Peggy had trouble with her

.serves. Neither she nor Joann
" played up to par. I've seen Joann
. play much better." Barbarich re-
' ‘marked.

Pitt’s two other veteran play-

i . ers, Eileen Surdoval and Elaine

Kingas, won by large margins:
6-1, 6-0, 6-2 and 7-5.

“It was a slow match. I’m used

to playing fast games," sighed

"L  Elaine. The C-MU coach added,

“Elaine really through our play-

‘Although the team was only se-

Mt. Lebanon and Allegheny Park
I tournaments. She is a member of

. -‘the Pittsburgh Women's Tennis
 Association.

Pitt’s coach, Dr. Edwards,

  missed the final scores. She was

.1--.,

' on her way to play in a Fox Chapel
 ~ - tournament.

In response to the question of
whether he’d drive a little easier
after last week’s skidding acci-
dent,,he said, “I didn’t let up any
after the accident last week and I
still managed to finish ninth. I
won’t let up this week either.”

Head mechanic Joe Dvorchak
was very pleased his driver felt
this way.

“I wouldn’t work _for a chicken
driver,” he stated, “If Bob didn’t
go all out, I would think he didn’t
have any confidence in the car
we’ve worked on.”

Joe was also- impressed with
the competence and speed of the
SAE engineers.

“I worked on Vetts for four
years at Kenny Ross and I know a
good mechanic when I see one,”
he said. “These engineers are
really good. We lost last week’s
race because of a brake failure.
Don Fisher, Don Mansfield and a
couple of other engineers came
out to the garage and looked over
the brakes.

“They discovered the problem,
redisigned the system, and in-
stalled it, all before they left that
night. Thanks to these students
we now have over 30 per cent more
braking power. And they really
impressed me with how quickly
they did it.

The Pitt Camaro isn’t winning
races, but with the help of SAE
and other students, more and
more bugs are being worked out
of the car.

Youth Day

A slight change has been made
in the plans for the special Youth
Day tickets for tomorrow’s game
at the Stadium with UCLA. Youth
Day tickets can be purchased at
any of Pitt’s 33 ticket agencies
and also at the Stadium the day of
the game. The tickets will be

I Panthers In
1970 Debut

At Stadium

(Continued from Page1Z)

DePasqua doesn’t expect his
squad, seven-point underdogs, to
have an easy time with either the
Bruin defense or offense. In fact,
he has been running circles just
to thrust his squad to the point of
progress which he had previously
calculated.

“Our tempo has been picking-
up,” DePasqua said earlier in the
week. “Offensive and defensive
injuries had hindered -our pro-
gress. I had hoped to be further

ahead, but our timing and tone is '

coming around.

DePasqua, naturally, has re-
fused to make any predictions. He
explained that his gridders have
encountered only each other, thus,
he is unable to forecast his squad’s
performance.

And UCLA, just what are they
expecting tomorrow? Do they be-
lieve that the Pitt of the last few
years has gone into hibernation‘?

“I think they respect us,” Panth-

' er linebacker Ralph Cindrich said.

“Yet, at times I really wonder
how UCLA is looking toward this
game.”

Tomorrow’s score will indicate
whether the Panthers have earn-
ed the respect of UCLA and the
nation.

New Yogis Challenger-

Veterans °Quack’ And
°Buzz’ For Top Spot

by WILLIE WINIT

After careful and time-consuming deliberations, the Yogishave
finally come up with the first week’s picks for the national gridiron

competition.

“My choices have to be right,” exclaimed Private “Buzz” Naab.
“I spent the last three days mulling over every team’s past records and
statistics and my selections are golden.”

The rest of the Yogis disagreed with “Buzz.” Ed “Quack” Conley"

retorted, “Your picks may be
golden when you are stationed at
Fort Knox, but you are out of step
this week. ”

Wee Willie Naab has reason to
boast. Last Year, “Buzz” took
top honors in the Yogi contest and
every since then, “Quack” has
realized that this season is a
“sink or swim” year for him.

“You are all wrong,” proclaim-
ed Don “Chief” Marbury. “I can’t
possibly lose this contest. My
scouts from all over the_ country
are sending me exclusive infor-
mation over my hot-line connec-
tion.”

The veteran Yogis will have to
beware of stiff competition from
upstart Marty “Zelmo” Hellman.
The Big “Z” is an old hand at play-
ing football contests.

“I should win this easily,” Zel-
mo declared, while drinking a
strange liquid. “I’ve got a secret
formula that always wins.”

entered the room.
.  9!

Just then Mike “Cutie” Miller
“Hi there,

exclaimed “Cutie.” “I

thought a pick was in basketball,
not in football.”

Jerry “Nubs” Myers arrived in

the nick of time. “This race won’t
even be close,’’ commented the
“Nubs.” “My choices will put you
guys in hot water."

Just then, Martha “Heartless” ‘

Hartle called in from Yale Uni-
versity. “I’m taking ‘Cutie’s‘ re-
mark about basketball to court,”
the first year barrister student

hollered.

Fiji

FallsTo Pi Lam,

Eagerly Awaits Pika

by VINCE DiNARDO

“We‘ll just have to go out and
beat PiKA." concluded Dave Em-
erV after his team. Phi Gamma
Delta lFljll. was defeated, 5-4, by
Pi Lambda Phi. Perhaps Emery
was recalling the many hotly con-
tested games between the FiJis
and PiKAs (Pi Kappa Alpha) last
year.

With their defeat. the Fijis lost
their share of first place in their
division. The Phi Gam’s had a
tough time putting hits together
in the game with the exception of
the fourth inning when they scored
their four runs and got five of
their nine hits.

The Pi Lams. on the other hand.
got at least two hits in each inn-
ing and scored one run each in the

_first five innings. In the Pi Lam

first. Snorkie Stark got on on an
error by Jim Ayers the Fiji short-
stop. Jim Davis then walked. and
singles by Alan Ginsburgh and
Sterno Stearnsand followed to ac-
count for the run.

In the second Pi Lam scored
again. Wally Waltrich led off with
a hit, Green then followed with
another hit. Two outs later, Stark
drove the run in with his first hit.
Ginsberg’s triple and Stearn-
sand’s second hit accounted for
their third inning run.

GOLFTMEETING

There will be a meeting for
all golfers and prospective golf-
ers on Monday, Sept. 21, at
5 p.m. in room 129, Trees Hall.

During this time. the Fijis were
held to one hit by Pi Lam pitcher
Dock Relis.

In the fourth. a three base er-
ror opened the gates for Pi Lam.
Ross. the runner later scored on
a fly ball to right.

Fiju then erupted for their four
runs to knot the game. Consecu-
tive singles by Van Kraus, Jim
Ayers, Bill Hull, Dave Emery and
Carl Luft totaled the Fiji scoring
for the afternoon.

Before the Fiji rally. Relis
forced the Fiji's to hit into seven
consecutive fly balls. To catch all

those fly balls the Pi Lams em-
ployed four outfielders instead of
the customary three. The last two
outs of the game. however, were
ground balls on the left side of the
infield.

The winning run scored on sin-
gles by Stearsand and Waltich
which wrapped were around a
walk to Ginsburgh.

"The Fijis aren‘t going to beat
us this year either." said Ron Ier-
ace of PiKa, whose two hits last
week helped the Pikes beat Pi
Lam. Both teams seem to be eag-
erly awaiting the game.

Double Forfiets Mar

Wed. Dorm Openers

This weeks intramural athletic
softball schedule was marred by
postponements and forfeits.
There were three forfeits and one
postponement.

The scheduled game between
Delta Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha fra-
ternities had to be postponed due
to the fact that Delta Phi had a
rush function at game time. The
game will be played at a later
date.

Alpha Epsilon Pi. hot from a
victory over Sigma Alpha Epsilon
last week, was dissapointed to
find no one there from Triangle.
The AEPi’s. regardless of the ab-
sence of Triangle. were awarded
the victory.

Pleasure Palace 
Stratford Call It 
After F our Innings 

by CHUCK STEEBER

If a team leads their opponent
by ten or more runs by the end of
four innings of play. the game
may be stopped then with the lead-
ing team credited with the win. So
states a rule of Intramural Soft-
ball. The rule was applied to the
game between Stratford and
Pleasure Palace.

Stratford won their softball
opener against Pleasure Palace.
13-3. A

Doug Browning of Pleasure Pa-
lace started the game with a ap-
parent hit to third base. Browning
made it to first base before the
ball. but was called out because
he didn‘t run straight down the
base line. The next batter, Chris
Thorsen. singled and later ad-
vanced to third on a double by Joe
Bryan. The next batter. Mike
Pines. popped the ball up to the
shortstop. Chuck Buechele then
hit to the shortstop and was call-
ed out at first.

Casey Kester started Stratford’s
hitting with a single. Tom Daly
banged a triple and drove in Kes-
ter.

The next batter. Tom Hormel.
was put on base by a walk.
