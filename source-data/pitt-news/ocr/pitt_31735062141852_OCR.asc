100 Student Aides Launch
Welfare Fund Campaign
On Campus Monday Noon

Pitt Unites with Carnegie
Tech, Duquesne, PCW
in Student Appeal

The campus drive in the Welfare
Fund campaign will be launched Mon-
day at a luncheon in Heinz House at
12:30 o’clock of about 100 student
workers. John Holbrook, Eng. ’34,
will preside at the meeting in which
members of the faculty and students
will discuss the campaign.

The University of Pittsburgh will
unite with Carnegie Tech, Duquesne,
and Pennsylvania College for Vvomen
in appealing to the students to sup-
port the seventy-ﬁve- agencies of the
Welfare Fund in their work for fam-
ily service, health service, character
building, and child care.

Dr. S. B. Linha.rt is chairman of the
University of Pittsburgh division.
Two sections have been set up; one
for the solicitation of the faculty and
the other for the students. Student
Council has unanimously endorsed
the project and urges every student
to participate according to his means.
Reed Rose, president of Student
Council, has appointed John Hol-
brook, Eng. '34, chairman of the stu-
dent campaign.

Dr. Linhart has appointed W. W.
Mendenhall faculty adviser to the
student campaign a.nd he will use the
YMCA oﬂice as his headquarters.
Although the Pitt drive is in charge
of the Y, this does not mean that the
fund is for the YMCA, as Dr. Linhart
said when he made the. appointment.

For the most part, students will be
seen for a few minutes in class ses-
sions. An individual solicitation will
be carried on among the juniors and
seniors of the College, Education,
and the seniors in Business Adminis-

I Intelligence

tration. Miss Helen Battrick, secre-
tary of the YVVCA, has been appoint-
ed faculty adviser for the women’s
division for individual solicitation
among the junior and senior women
in these schools.

Frosh Rating
Stands "High

Tests Show
Increase from 1931

The intellectual average of this
year’s Pitt freshman, as shown in the
results of the American Council on
Education Psychological Tests taken
recently, is 156.23, rising over the
148.65 average rating of 1931.

According to the average score for

freshman stu-dents throughout the
United. States, 147.37, the Pitt stu-

dents stand far ahead.

The purpose of the test, as pointed
out by Dr. Omar Held, psycho-logy de-
partment, is to enable the faculty to
get a real idea of the student’s capa-
L.~ilities and to decide on methods
which would help '-the student to get
the most out of his college work.

‘‘If a student’s high school record
has been excellent and he is superior]
in the test, and then his college work,
falls down,” Dr. Held explained, “weI
know that something is wrong andi
try to get at the root of the trouble;
But if the student’s high school workI
was poor and he falls down on the test I

and college work, too, it looks as if heI

Pitt’s ferocious mascot Panther will shortly strut out on he

drive for funds which will be held today by the Traditions Commit-

buy the Panther a new suit.
And it promises come true, Pitt will

have a whole family of Panthers be-I

fore the drive is over. Two Panther

suits are certain to be purchased by‘

interested persons on the campus. A
third suit will be bought by the do-
nations of Pitt students today. Stu-
dents from various organizations will

canvass the school all day in the
hopes that Mr. Student and Miss Coed
will take pity on the~poor animal-and
give a few pennies for his suit.

The Dents and Engineers have
pledged one hundred per cent for the
drive and already lead the other cam-
pus schools. Students in the College,

School of Education, and School of‘

Business Administration will do their
part today.

Arthur Goldberg, Col. '33, chairman
of Council’s Traditions Committee
said today, “It’s a crime that the
Panther should face the wintry winds
in the Stadium in the threadbare suit
which he’s worn for such a long time.
If plans turn out the way we expect
them to, we’ll have three or four
Panthers on ‘the ‘ ﬁeld, cavorting
around and doing their bit during
football games.”

So lct’s go folks. A penny for the
Pantlier is a penny for dear old Pitt.
And if you see a wee little Panther
cub on the ﬁeld one of these ﬁne days,
don’t be surprised. It's just another
vote for the Pitt cheering sections.
And anyhow, how could you have a
Panther family without

PITTSBURGH, PENNA.

November 2, 1932.

In reference to a demonstration of Pitt students upon the Car-
negie campus on October 31, It has been deemed advisable by both
the Dean of Men and myself to remind you of an agreement that
our two schools and student bodies have had in the past.

I am very much concerned to know whether this agreement is
to b-e adhered to this year. The agreement has been stated that the
“Student Councils at Carnegie Institute of Technology and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh have mutually pledged that the members of
the student bodies will not visit each oth-er’s campus to interfere
with athletic signs, paint letters, create disturbances, or damage
property. The’counc'iIs being opposed to these campus tnespasses,
they have agreed to pay for any damage done by their students in
Any student, therefore, who commits an act of the
above description, is not only disloyal to the cause of student govern-
ment and his college but is involving his Student Council in a debt

Council Members Discuss
Testimonial Assembly;
Student Union

,:.

Plan. University Dance

   

Taking a ﬁrm stand on Pitt-Carne-

evidence of strict enforcement of coun-
cil regulations, Pitt's student assem-
bly passed a resolution Tuesday night
upholding the agreement between the
two schools which prohibits invasion
of their respective campuses during
football celel rations. Aroused by a.
letter from the Tartan school’s coun-
cil which scored the invasion of
Tech’s campus during the Pitt victory
celebration on the Monday following
the Notre Dame game, Council ad-
-mitted the violation of the agreement
and promised that future violators
will be dealt with severely.

From the bulk of business which
faced council Tuesday night, con-
structive action was taken on the pro-
posed plans for the student union, an
all-university dance, a testimonial as-
sembly for Coach Jock Sutherland, and
the investigation for storm barriers on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral and a.
smoking room in Alumni Hall.

Discuss Student Union

. Following the routine committee re-
ports which opened the meeting,
President Rose opened the discussion
on the plans for a student union.
IEdmond Breene, Mines "“’ reported

Du,
Iand suggested the use of two rooms
on the seventh floor of the Cathedral.

Chancellor John G. Bowman and
, Mr. John Weber, business manager of
Ithe University, have given their
‘sanction to the student union plans,
Breene, reported, Comparing the
proposed Cathedral rooms with the
space formerly used in Schenley Ho-
tel, Breene reported 5820 square feet
for the Schenley and 5354 for the
Cathedral, Council passed on the
Cathedral proposal on the basis that
the rooms will accommodate 375 cou-
ples and will be ﬂoored and com-
pleted by the University. .\«'lembers
of student council and the student re-
lations committee of that body will
meet tonight at an inforrnal social in
,the Falk clinic to test the type of
iﬁooring which has been suggested
for the Cathedral.

Letter Is Bombshell

Rose’s presentation of the Tech
Student Council letter was the bomb-
shell which started a long discussion
on the question. “We’ve broken the
agreement and 11aven’t been penal-
ized,” President Rose announced.
“The basis of the trouble is probably
that our student body isn’t aware of
the existence of an agreement. Al-
though no damage was done during
the invasion, the wording of the
agreement states that we ‘created
disturbance.’ If we go over there
and as much as yell ‘Yeah Pitt’ we
are breaking the agreement.”

Franklin Kallfelz, Eng. ’33, pro-
posed the resolution siipportmg the
agreement, a resolution which coun-
cil passed unanimously. “VVe uphold
this agreement, and ask the Pitt
News to publicize it among the stu-
dent body to insure future peace on
both campuses,” was the text of
Kallfelz’ motion.

Approval of Housing
Bureau Necessary
For Residences

“All residences are visited by us
and must have our approval before
students are permitted to live in
them," was the statement made by
Miss Isabelle Anderson, assistant to
the dean of women, and in charge of
housing. “Besides serving the purpose
of inspection, this visit also‘ enables
us to come in Contact with the fam-
ilies with whom the students are re
siding,” she added.

The number of women living away,
from home this year, nineteen per
cent of the total women’s enrollment
is practically the same as last year
Of this total, eight per cent reside ir-
student houses. seven per cent in pr?
vate homes, and four per cent w'il.h
relatives. There are none living in pub-
lic boarding houses. Each residence
is required by the ofﬁce of the dean
to furnish both. room and board.

The four student houses bear
fraternity names and are rented and
managed by wo1nen’s fraternities, but
students may live in them regardless
of fraternity afﬁliations.

Curtius Says
Fascism Ends

Former German Minister
Opposes Von Papen

“Fascism is on the downward trend
in Germany, and Hitler must become
a secondary leader,” said Dr. Julius
Curtius, former foreign minister of
Germany, and cited as evidence the
two million deﬁcit of fascist votes
cast last weekas compared ..with the.
1931 election.

In his speech on “European Eco-
nomic Cooperation” at a dinner of
the Foreign Policies Association, Dr.
Curtius predicted that customs unions

among the European nations would
be attempted after the passing of the
political and ﬁnancial crisis. Many
Pitt students heard the speech and
attended the open forum afterward.

Dr. Curtius, who until 1927 took an
active part in politics and economics,
expressed his belief that Germany
will win her ﬁght for arms equality,
and suggested that a Centrist coali-
tion might soon be formed. Although
Dr. Curtius is not in sympathy with
present government in Germany
which is headed by Von Papen, he
sees no likelihood of -an immediate
change.

Bureau Odors
Varied Work

Electricians and Window-
‘Washers Are Needed

 

The 800 letters sent out by the em-
ployment bureau to the wealthy resi-
dents of Pittsburgh are beginning to
bring in results. Chester B. Bennett,
who is in charge of the bureau, has
already received several replies from
prominent Pi-ttsburghers. offering im-
mediate or future employment to Pitt
students. Telephone calls are also
bringing in requests for student help.

The positions thus offered are quite
varied. One request has been for
some one to ﬁx an intricate electrical
train, which has baffled the owner
since its purchase. Window washers
and chauffeurs have also been re-
quested.

Discovering that some of the fac-
ulty buy their coal through the Uni-
versity’s purchasing agent, 1‘/Ir. Ben-
nett has been making arrangements
to give a few young huskies employ-
ment transferring said coal from
trucks to cellars and bins. The com-
ing elections will also offer chances
of employment to quite a few stu-
dents. The three Pittsburgh daily
newspapers are cooperating for the
purpose of compiling returns, and
several hundred young men. acting
under the direction of a representative
of the papers. will be required to col-
lect and bring in these ﬁgures.

“While not all the replies received
have brought offers of employment,”
says Mr. Bennett, “they reflect the
ﬁne spirit of the residents of Pitts-
burgh.”

So Say Princeton and Virginia Men Who Come From
Schools Where Cutting Up is Really Cutting Up

 

Students at Pitt who believe they are unprincipled when they

The gentlemen referred to are

victory need a lesson or two in

'indeCOI‘11I11. At least so believe college students who clon’t»wearthe

Princeton and University of Vir-

ginia debaters who were here Friday for the political symposium.
J. A. Cobey a.nd J. H. Schelﬂy represented Princeton, while Virginia

sent E. C. McC1intock, Jr., and W. Sn:
Mllndy. Their opinions are well de-
ﬁned. ,..“.Back where they come -from,
things are different.” And according
to the 111911, Pitt must a prosaic insti-
tution.

For instance. professors at Vir-
_ S33’ _th_eir proteges, encounter
possible eviction every time they face
a class. One false word, a stamping

of feet begins, and the wise instruc-

tor simply leaves the room in dis-
grace. The onl_V difference between

a wise and a foolish prof, apparently,
is that a. bit more pounding is requir-
ed to eject the latter.

Cuts? Mention the word and a Vir-
ginian laughs! UD until recently his
faculty took no roll whatsoever. Now
the abject stude is permitted “only”
twenty unexplained absences before
Holmes take the case. And ROTC?
There is none in Virginia U. “Leave
that t0 the Vifginia n1il.ita1'y academ-
ies,” he remarks with some ‘disdain.
“Tl1at’s their job.”

Student opinion in Princeton. too,
is g8I1e1'a11y opposed to the ROTC.
Even the “Daily Princetonian” edi-
torial boa.rd, said a visitor from the
New Jersey school. has a deﬁnite pol-
icy against the organiaztion.

There are no Princeton fraternities,
according to Nassau men. In their
place are clubs, recruiting members
only from the upper classes and pro-
viding board, 11ot room, for their
members. For freshmen and sopho-
mores, a. system of “commons,” giv-
ing meals and socia.l activity at low
cost, take the place of fraternities.
Approximately 80 per cent of the ju-
niors and seniors are club members.

In politics, both Virginia and
Princeton are weighted down bv tra-
dition. A presidential poll conducted
in the southern institution gave
Roosevelt the traditional Democratic
lead, while Princeton students.
staunchly Republican. cast more than
65 per cent of their ballots for Hoov-

er. Thomas polled one out of every
ﬁve votes in —. Princeton,’ his alma
mater, but received only twenty-
seven in a total of 588 east in Vir-
ginia.

The much-prated “Jeffersonian de-M

mocracy”-is really applied in Vir-
ginia, declare its men. Jefferson

to be read and referred to as the
ﬁnal authority on every question.

In Virginia, great formality of man-
ner is observed. One can know a
person for six months and still ad-
dress him by “Mister.” And when
the Mister is dropped, the last name
is used, never the ﬁrst name.

Reorganized
Staff Meets

Sieg Leads New Program of
Education School

An enlarged School of Education
faculty met last Friday afternoon un-
der the leadership of Dr. L. P. Sieg,
acting dean, who described in detail
his views on the new organization and
pointed out proposed curricular
changes.

Early last week, upon the recom-
mendation of Dr. Sieg, twenty-three
members of the various departments
of the College were appointed also to
the staff of the School of Education,
while several members of the Educa-
tion faculty received joint appoint-
ments in departments of the College.

“This arrangement,” according to
the dean, “aims to eﬁect a more uni-
ﬁed teacher preparation program at
the University.

“Since practically 80 per cent of a
prospective teacher's training,” said
Dr. Sieg, “is in academic subjects, it
is only reasonable that professors
concerned with that part of the pro-
gram be allowed some voice in the
problems of the School of Education.”

Committees were appointed to re-
view the content of major and minor
subjects and to study professional
course offerings. Some changes are
contemplated in both of these aspects
of the education program.

Cornhuskers Primed

 

CHICAGO, Nov. 10.—After

a twelve-hour stay in the Windy

City, Pitt’s Golden Panthers entrained to penetrate the mid-section
of the west this evening on the last leg of their railroad journey to-
yards Lincoln, Nebraska, where tomorrow the Cornhuskers will test
Pittsburgh ’s right to an undefeated gridiron year. ‘

Sight seeing, and a practice

at the University of Chicago ﬁeld

completed the day of activity of Jock Sutherland ’s thirty-three war-
riors. Leaving Pittsburgh last evening?

at 10:45, the good night's sleep left
the Panthers in a rested condition but
still far from_ condition as one might
want to see them enter the ﬁeld, Sat-
urday.

Sutherland, more this week than
any other during the entire season, is
worried as to the possibilities of the
Panthers in their fourth meeting with
the Cornhuskers. The regulars, mis-
used in their last four games, will
probably not see action in the begin-
ning eras of tomorrow's-game.

Use Substitutes

During the week in Pittsburgh. and
today at Stagg Fielu, Dr. -Sutherland
experimented with a new lineup, the
one which acquitted itself splendidly
against Penn at Philadelphia last
week. Miller Mungas has been carry-
ing the duties of Bob Hogan. Weisen-
baugh has been replacing Weinstock,
Rocker, Meredith, and Ormiston ha.ve
been functioning in the line. Tormey

may also be replaced in tomorrow's-

game, Shotwell playing the pivot po-
sition.

But even with such solace, the good
doctor remains in a disposition akin
to pessimism. Nebraska more than
Army is awaiting a chance to a.venge
its defeat in the hands of the Panthers
last Thanksgiving Day on Stadium
Field. Expected to show a great

ﬁght, the Cornhuskers were routed in‘

a most unorthodox manner, 40-0, their
worst trouncing in years.
Decide Tactic-s in 1931

Right then and there Coach Da.na
X. Bible -decided that when the Corn-
huskers met their eastern opponents
in 1932 a far different team would
take the ﬁeld. Strangely, that's just
what is going to happen. Steve
Hokuf, who Stallds so many inches
higher than any Panther, Saur, and
Materson, who may be called the
Heller-Reider combination of the Ne-
braska eleven are marking time until
2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon to see
whether or not the Panther tail may
be twisted.

With Coach Sutherland, Coach Andy
Gustafson, director of athletics,
W. Don Harrison, assistant director,
James Hagan, Goldberg, Lewis, and
McFarland, managers, and newspa-
pernien, the following players are on
their way to Lincoln, Nebraska:

Ends—Ted Dailey, Joseph Sklada.-

.Navy and West Point Matches
i Probably Most Difficult

Advance notice that King Football's
reign will soon be over comes with
the announcement that boxing team
lpractices will start Monday, Novem-
lber 14, at Trees Gym.

Training will start at 3:30 o'clock,
and will be held at Trees Gym until
the end of the football season when
activities will be transferred to the
Stadium. All freshman and varsity
candidates for positions are requested
to attend these workouts.

As a change from the policy follow-
ed for the past two seasons, three
men will be kept for each class, and
each one will be given an opportu-
nity to earn a varsity letter. All
cla.sses from the 115 pound to the 175
pound will be on the program. It is
quite unlikely that heavyweights will
return to the scene.

Pitt's schedule for the coming year
calls for an abundance of good ma-
terial. Several of the strongest
teams in the country. including Navy
and VVest Point, will be met. Matches
with Temple. Duquesne. W. & J., and
two with Vilest Virginia. in addition
to the above, complete the schedule.
At the close of the regular season,
Pitt will probably enter several mitt-
men in the Eastern Conference of In-
tercollegiates at Morgantown on
March 17.

The boxing team will complete a
partial tour of the country during
their season. visitingeAnnr=uolis. Vvest
Point, Philadelphia, and Morgantown.
The remainder of the bouts will be
at home. ,

Several important positions remain.

Namlick. and Martin leaves three po-
fsitions to be ﬁlled. Captain Seigel,

Schricker, and Conti are the only let-
itermen returning to the squad, but a
[very promising array of tale-.nt from
last year's freshman totirney seems
likely "So give the lettermen a real
ﬁght for their positions.

More attention will be devoted to a
freshman team this year, and al-
though no matches have been arrang-
ed as yet. it is quite pos:-zible that the
athletic oflice will do so.

ed to answer the first call for candi-

WAA Plans
Sports Day

Eight Colleges Take Part in
Pitt Event

 

WAA’s Fall Sports Day, evolved
from an elaborate yearly event in-
augurated in 1927, will take place to-
morrow afternoon in Trees gym from
1 to 7:30 o'clock. Each of these eight
schools within this vicinity will be
represented by twelve participants:
Westminster College, -California State
Teachers College, Indiana State
Teachers College, Slippery Rock
Teachers College, Carnegie institute
of Technology, Duquesne University,
Pennsylvania College for Women and
Pitt.

An extensive program has been
prepared by the various committees
for their guests. The day will be
divided into four periods. From 1:00
to 2:00 o'clock will be taken up with
registration when each woman will
be assigned to a color team led by
one of the Pitt women. Thus, school
will not compete against school but
rather one team will play against an-
other. -

WAA advisers will welcome the
participants and will give the direc-
tions for the day’s activities. It’ the
weather is favorable the sports will
be ﬁeld hockey, soccer, indoor base-
ball, and volleyball; if it rains, Ping-
pong, volleyball, handball and swim-
ming will make up the program. Fol-
lowing a dip into -Trees Pool, XVAA
will serve refreshments to consist of
boxed lunches and chocolate milk.
At this time the points gained by each
team will be announced. The day
will end with social dancing, games,
and tho singing of school songs.

BITS '3'

At last the Pitt band can claim al
ranking among the best collegiate
bands in the country. Their showing
at the Pitt-Penn game was one of
the most pleasant surprises that a
Pitt organization has sprung this year.

A new scheme is being tried
out by boxing coach Joe Orsini in
his gym classes. Two men of
equal weight are picked and then
blindfolded. Both boys are given
boxing gloves and told to go to
it. The main idea is to develop
good equilibrium.

Everett Utterback, who made real
track history at Pitt for quite a while,
is a member of one of Orsini’s boxing
classes.

As predicted in Pitt Bits at the
beginning, several Pitt subs are
showing real talent. This was
shown quite clearly against Penn
last Saturday when Howdy O’De|l,
Weisenbaug-h, and quite a few
others played real football. Kutz,
although merely a third stringer,
paved the way for the second Pitt
touchdown.

The cheerleaders, as usual, made
the trip with the team, but their main
asset, the tumblers. were not present.
The “Panther” looked ragged with
the light green‘ overshoes.

Muggsy Skladany and 'Onder
showed Philly fans how real
tackling should. be done, but the
officials penalized both for rough-
nes-s.

A certain Pitt party, travelling to
the game, found out how effective the
state police teletype system works.
The party, consisting of two coeds
";.l1d three male students. was stopped
by the state police at Bedford. The
‘.5-letype, from Edgewood, asked the
troopers to hold the pa.rty, stating
that the one coed had run away from
home. and might be eloping.

A quick phone call by the troop-

era to the coed’s mother revealed
that the boy-friend had sent
through the call as a joke. The

joker, from late reports, has been

in the custody of the state troop-

ers for misuse of the police tele-
type.

If any of you coeds are interested
in getting arrested, you might pick
out the state police at Bedford to do
the job. With Corporal Maroney in
command, the sub-station has about
the best looking troopers in the state,

A genteel racket is worked at

Franklin Field after the games.

The colors of the winning team

are sold for fifty cents, and those

of the losing team are offered for
thirty-five cents.

Tredennick, Former Army
Star, Loses To Beginner

Lieutenant D. C. Tredennick, former
West Point hand-ball champion and
now Pitt instructor of military sci-
ence, bowed last week to Lt. E. M.
Murray in a hard fought battle on
the P. A. A. court. The ﬁrst game
was taken by Lt. Tredennick, but the
West Pointer was left with a tired
feeling which he was unable to over-
come. The score at the end of this
game stood Tredennick 21, Murray 19.
[he two following games fell to the
lxocrinner as the W'est Point pride
failed to recover his grip, with a score
of 21-3, 21-2. Cadet Lt. Murray an-

nounces that he is looking for heavier
competition,

Campus Welfare Drive

FOR THE second successive year Pitt students will have an oppor-
tunit.y to support the Welfare Fund through a campaign con-
ducted on the campus. Starting on Monday, seventy—ﬁve students
under the leadership of John B. I-Iolbrook will canvass the school
for funds to continue the extensive welfa.re work among destitute
families in Allegheny County.

The campaign is hue which deserves the support of every stu-
dent in the University. Realizing that business conditions are dif-
ﬁcult and that they aifect the college student probably more than
the general group of citizens, it is yet possible for students to give a
small amount of what they would spend next week for other things
than necessities. Miss a movie, buy only one pack of cigarets, spend
less for refreshments, and use the money you save in this manner to
help feed and support a destitute family somewhere.

The goal for the campus campaign is $16,000, a greater part of
which is given by the faculty. The amount raised from stiiclent
donations last year reached only $2,100. Divided among more than
six thousand students in the University, it represents an amount
which might easily be spared from a week’s allowance.

The Aggreeimei-int Controversy

HREATENING to “deal sufficiently” with any violators of the

Pitt-Tech agreement respecting invasion of each other’s campus,
Student Council appears determined to really govern the Pitt stu-
dent body, a function which seems to have become obsolete with
student council in the past few years. Dispensing quickly with
routine reports on dances, assemblies, and pep rallies, which activi-
ties stood paramount on the records of former councils, this year’s
group took up the Tech matter with a resoluteness and ﬁcrceness
of dispatch seldom witnessed in council meetings.

With President R-ose’s admission that “we have broken the
agreement and havcii’t been penalized for it” began forty-ﬁve min-
utes of earnest discussion 011 the letter from the Tech council which
reminded Pitt of the agreement a.nd urged its enforcement. Mem-
bers of Council justified the student celebration on the Moiiclay fol-
lowing the Notre Dame defeat but deplored the violation of the
agreement. A resolution urging the enforcement of the pact was
passed unanimously by the group.

Although students are asked to cooperate with Council in cu-
forcing the agreement, violations will be dealt with in a severe
manner through the offices of the Dean of Meii and the Dean of
V\'oiiicii. Breaking of the agreciiieiit by any student on the Pitt
campus violates the pledge of his student council and involves it in
a debt of honor. It is time that Pitt students recognize the exist-
ence of the pact and give Council full support in maintaining friend-
ly relations between the two institutions.

By Don Early

Despite our taste for social prob-
lems and the intense psychological
situation in drama these days, there
are times when a burst of robust
romanticism delights us. Undoubted-
ly we lean a little too far toward in-
tellectualism and a sort of O’Neil
austerity, so that it is only natural if
sometimes we wish for a few rhet-
orical capers, a ﬂash of color, and
good romantic passion. For after all,
though we might call ourselves clas-
sicists, romanticists, impressionists,
constructivists, or by whatever term
can be applied in "describing an atti-
tude toward drama, it does not much
matter. Such terms only designate
the element of immediate paramount
interest. Back of it all is the human
fabric, with its mental complexities,

social pressures, and imaginative
longings, and we cannot help recog-
nizing ourselves when authentic

glimpses are given us.
Cyrano de Bergerac

So “Cyrano de Bergerac” was com-
pletely satisfying. Soineliow, one is
always surprised that he likes the
play so much. For after all, it is
‘lrawn in a period which has been
well covered and commonized by ro-
maiicers of the Dumas, Scott, Saba-
tini type; it is rhetorical, and the
poetry is apt to appear conventiona.l.
But this we forget, a.nd experience
the time with delightful reality. The
rhetoric is the same sort that gives
us pleasure in Shakespeare, and as
for the poetry, well, it is fresh and

since Adam have said.

Walter Hampden carries humor in-
to the play with a ﬁne touch. Per-
haps it is this and a certain tone of
mockery and cynicism that makes
Cyrano de Bergerac so modernly per-
tinent. We like the ﬁne ﬂing, the
nobility of resignation, ._which often
times, when we sum up our human

left. .
Again—Miss Cather

To speak of books, we think Willa
Catlier’s “Obscure Destinies” about
the finest thing we have come across
in the shops this season. Miss Cath-
er has been doing consistently some
of the best work in America. She
has bothered little with new move-
ments and experiments, but gone
straight ahead, bringing virtue to es-
tablished forms and techniques; a.nd
as a result. there are but few who,
for artistic soundness and under-
standing of humanity, may compare
with her. This, of course, is true of
her treatment of the novel and short
story.

The three stories comprising the
volume are as perfect as anything
she has done. They treat of the
lives of men and women whose ob-

scure destinies, in ordinary life,1
would mature unperceived. To us.
however, they are immensely im-
Y.)Ol‘l,8.l‘.l.. “Neighbor Rosicky,” the

first of the stories, is probably the
best, though on this level gradations
are difficult to make. One reinem-.
hers the mood of “My Aiitoiiia” in!
reading it, only with a consciousness
of more maturity, more breadth in
handling this '.—id.niii'able ﬁgure.

I-Irmanity ﬁlls the story in a rich,
tangible way, so that one thinks:
here the writing stops and lives, and
the people come out and move be-
fore us. Certainly when an author
can do this, not much is left to be
asked for. Everyone should enjoy
reading “Obscure Destinies.”

Jeritza Sings Tonight

It seems Puccini once wrote an
opera for a lady whose voice he T"‘lll"ll
admired. The opera was “Turandot.”
and the lady was Jeritza. Tonight at
the Mosque she will sing. Jeritza
has been heard by a rather restricted
group in Pittsbiirgh, so that the a.udi-
ence tonight should be large and un-
usually expectant. A number of the
critics praise her as the dominatins:
soprano of the opemtic stage. Most
of us think of Rosa Ponselle, or per-
haps Lily Pons; but. we are told. as
though having overlooked someone
completely, there is always Jerifza.

This improvement in the band since
the Ohio State game probably wasn’t
noticed by the loyal Pitt rooter, to
whom the band is “old stuff” and who
has such distractions as the in-
between-halves ﬁst ﬁght to contend
with. Nevertheless the number of
“bouqiiets” passed to the Pitt band
by Notre Dame partisans indicated a
tropical fecundity of ﬂowers in their

Coed Debate
Team Chosen

Theresa Kahn, Director,
Predicts Good Season

The Vv'omeii’s Debating Association
has selected its upperclass squad for
1932-33 with the appointment of four-
teen members to the squad.

Additional tryouts for the team may
be arranged by special appointment
with Miss Theresa Kahn, faculty di-
rector of wonien’s debating. In Miss
Kalin’s opinion, “The year should be
a very successful one, inasmuch as
so many experienced debaters have
returned to the squad and the caliber
of debating exhibited by the new
members is -so high. The program for
the year promises to be more exten-
sive than ever before.”

Intrainurai debates wil1 be held in
November, debates before high
schools and civics groups in Decem-
ber, while the collegiate season will
‘open in, January.
the
question, “Resolved, That the young
woman of 1932 is in a more advanta-
geous Dosition than the young woman
of 1910,” before the mothers of the
women of the sophomore class at a tea
at Heinz House, Thursday, November
17. Genevieve Blatt, president of the
association upheld the principles of
the Socialist party at the Political
Symposium at Sclienley High school
last Friday. Other members of the
association ushered for the occasion.

The two topics to be debated in ex-
tension and intercollegiate debates
for the year are: “Resolved, That the
government should own and operate

public-utilities” and “Resolved, That-

the United States should agree to the
cancellation of the interallied war
debt.”

Arrangements for at least ten inter-

-collegiate debates are under way. A

trip either through Ohio and Michi-
gan or into New England is being con-
sidered, in addition to shorter trips
into West Virginia and through Penn-
sylvania.

The squad will consist of the follow-
ing members from last year's team:
Genevieve Blatt, presi-dent, Col. ’33;
Marie Kornman, Ed‘. ’33; Zora Unko-

yitch. Col. T33; Marjorie Hanson, Col.

’34; Gertrude Slutsky, Col. ’34; Eva
Sypiiiewski, Col. ’35; Alice Reinherr,
Col. '35; Irma Tapner, Col. ’35; Ruth
Simon, Col. '35. Newcomers to the
squad include: Agnes Calabrese,

Marion Eppiiig, Col. ’35; Helen Smith
Col. ’35; Rebecca Hirsch, Col. '35.

YM Opens Contemporary
Library For Students’ Use

For students who are interested in
gaining a perspective on useful iii-
formation, YMCA has offered itself
as a medium to acquaint the students
with contemporary books and pamph-
lets which have evoked unusual criti-
cism and comment during the past
several months. YMCA has in its
ofﬁce a varied collection of books
ranging from Walter Lippmann’s
“Preface to Morals” to Norman
Thomas’ “As I See It.”

The Y intends to offer the students
a library from which they can borrow
books and magazines without charge,
to read in the Hut. A reading room
will be furnished in the Y office for
the students’ convenience. Edward
Yellig, Mines ’35, has been placed in
charge of the collections.

Uniontown Women Earn
New Pitt Armbands

UNIO-NTOWN, Nov. 10—(Specia1 to

Pitt News.) — A test was given
i yesterday for freshman girls.
}Over the week-end, eleven girls

were learning “Alma Mater,”

“Hail to Pitt,” and the his-

tory and rules of the Center. They

were all eager to earn a Pitt armb-and
with which to replace the green
cheese-cloth they have been wearing.
Some girls threaten a bonﬁre for their
old bands; more sentimental freshies
will cherish them in scrap-books
along with old. letters and other me-
mentoes. ‘

A mixer took place Friday night.
The sole member 01. the faculty rep-
resented was Miss Constance K.
Knobelsdorf, French instructor. The
other instructors journeyed to Pitts-
burgh to witness the Pitt-Notre Dame
tilt.

Students have been over-iiidustrioiis
this week. Soon they will know the
results of their ﬁrst six weeks of
study.

On Wednesday, the freshmen were
very nervous. Their ﬁrst theme was
due that day. Before class, the soph-
omores read the masterpiece and

lavishly advised against this and that.
The gist of their advice usually is:
“Don’t study so hard. Vvhy, last year

” The cramming they do before
examinations is quite noticeable, how-
ever.

Correction

   

The subject of the seminar address
delivered before the student branch
of the American Society of Civil Eng-
ineers last week by Fredrick J. Glis-
dorf, instructor in English, was
“Standai'ds of Literary Criticism,"
and not a discussion of foreign engi-
neering work as erroneously reported
in the News.

Mr. Gilsdorf, popular with the ASCE
nieiiibers by reason of his ‘contact
with them instriictor iii Englisli
for civil engineering seniors, fornicrly
was connected with I\3'aticn’s Business
magazine in an editorial capacity.
The name of the above piiblicaticu
was incorrectly stated as the “Nation"
in the Tuesday issue of the News.

One of the ﬁrst base hospitals to
leave for France was a group of Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh undergraduate
fraternity men.

"Armistice day, 1918, at Base Hos-
pital 27, stationed at Angers, France,
was the scene of unbridled joy. This
group organized in July, 1917, under
Dr. R. T. Miller a Pitt professor of
surgery, who is now at Johns Hop-
kins. Medical students were not en-
listed as there was need for them to
ﬁnish their training; but undergradu-
ates were taken along toparticipate
in clerical work, ambulance driving,
orderly activities, carpentering, cook-
ing, and even nursing althougli pretty
nurses from the Pittsburgh hospitals
were most eﬂicient in this line.

Staff doctors were aéti‘ve"' in the
trench dressing stations. Dr. J. H.
Wagner, who is chief physician at
Carnegie Steel Company, was among
those who were actively engaged in

istice Day itself.

“The first of the month” used to be a time of
feverish activity for ledger clerks. But the Bell
System accounting stziﬁ‘—— breaking away from
tradition — siinpliﬁed the keeping of accounts and
rendering of monthly statements to customers.

They applied a modern system of rotatiozz bill-
ing to the telephone business which now spreads
this work evenly throughout the month. In co-
operation with manufacturers, they devised special
typewriters and bool-;l~:ecping machines. Thus
they did away with incﬂicicnt rush and achieved

greater accuracy, speed and neatness.

looking for the more eﬂicient Way!
