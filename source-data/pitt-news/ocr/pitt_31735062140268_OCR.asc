caused some surprise in
circles as the

‘ a‘ suitable place to practice. Naturally

the ?.1l3l3€aranCe of the seven in Cleve-

The‘ committee immediately took
steps to ﬁnd the exact facts in‘ the

' case and summoned the men com-

prising the team to appear before

. the board _last \/Vedn-esday evening

for an examination.

After hearing the statements of all
those concerned in the matter it was
decided that some punishment must
b-e meted out to the offenders, not
for personal prejudice, but to pro-

rules. Accordingly the following
motions were made and seconded:
‘that Mr. Hittner and Mr. Haggerty

itable List of Games Arranged
For Coming Season —- West
Virginia First Game.

The baseball -bee is beginning to
appear’ among the students, as the
days become warmer, and the dia-
mond stories issue from the training

places of the professional nines in the.
. South.

The mild days, of last week
brought back the tender memories of
the great national pastime and many
of the"students from Senior to Fresh-
man were willing to risk the ills of
a cold -by going out ‘in the open to
toss the bounding sphere. Manager
Leitch, of the Varsity nine, was equal-
ly enthusiastic about the weather, be-
cause it meant the early start of
practice and the realization of the
schedule taking form under his guid-
ance. P —

Better, however, than the glowing
weather and the prospects of spring,
was the ofﬁcial announcement of the
baseball schedule at the regular meet-
ing of the athletic committee last
Wednesday evening. Thus far the list
comprises seven games in all, the en-
tire number being arranged for for-
eign fields. The most important icon-
tests are the ones with Penn State
and the University of VVest Virginia.

The schedule is as follows:
April 18--\/Vest Virginia.
.=\pril 28——Carnegie Tech.
April 29—VVaynesburg.
May .l3——Califo‘rnia Normal.
May 19--Bellefonte.

May 20——State College.

May 27——S't. Vincent.

Considering the fact that the
schedule was originally arrangedfor

the intended Independent nine the list 4
is not lacking in general importance. 3'
It is more than likely, had the pres-f

ent manager known the possibility of
a varsity nine, the schedule
have been considerably ‘better.

The University of Pittsburgh, seeing
the need for such a school, established
such a course in the school of Econ-
