By JAMES C. PLUNKETT

Set back seven. days from its
original date, Interfraternity week
will open at 7:30 o’clock tomorrow
night in Foster memorial when all
freshmen men interested in fra-
ternity life will “Meet the Greeks”
at a stag smoker, first of three
welcome events planned by the
Interfraternity council.

Harold Oakes, Ed42, Theta
Chi, anounced that C. G. Hobart,
a graduate of Northwestern uni-
yersity, and a member of Beta
Theta Pi fraternity, will be the
smoker. .

Mr. Hobart, along with Chancel-
lor John S. Bowman, did extensive
work last year on the China re-
lief fund. He will give a general
review of fraternity life at large
universities such as Pitt.

Following Hobart’s review, an
.open forum will be conducted
with members of the audience
partaking in the discussion. Re-
freshments will be served and
several numbers will be ‘played
by the GBJ's, a nationally known
novelty trio now enrolled in the
University.

Foster memorial also will be the

Editor, The Pitt News:

As engineeﬁrs we do not‘ get much time to enjoy
the beauties of the new Tuck shop. We like the
place, but we believe that somethingis missing.
“In short the Tuck shop needs a juke box.

The installation would not cost the University

, cent, and would be a source of proﬁt for some
worthy University cause.

There are several concerns in Pittsburgh that,
for their ﬁfty percent take, would be glad to

install the latest model phonograph complete with ,

peakers, wall boxes, and built—in rainbow,

It seems that there are just a few who would
not enjoy music with their “cokes.” However,
the overwhelming majority of the students are
eager for it. '

Q We hope that in the near future the proper
strings will be pulled so we can get the juke box.

  Free World Nlagazine
Speaks of Past, Present

- sy EDGAR 1. BIEGEL

, Real hope for the people in the world who haven’t “arrived”——
'and the dread of those who have—is that things will be different

after the war, that the center of power will shift.

The urban

dwellers of America and Europe are the ‘people that take the four-
i_ freedoms and the eight-points seriously. ’
That is why an organization called Free World might mean

something to those people, the
people who realized that all of

the other committee: were fronts

for the people who had “ar-
rived;" why a Free World asso-

' ciition »might have represented
the great Democratic Front of
the world, which means nothing
more than People's Front; why a
magazine Free World might have
been a Bible for these people,
a literary front for what the war
will bring-

lt Falls Short
Unfortunately the attractively-

, edited “Free World” that reached

the newsstands this month falls
short ofethe goal, tells too much
of what we have to save, too little
of what the “people” want. Free
Mlorld thinks the people must be
‘awakened when the need is for
drive; the people need a reason
as well as an excuse.

Walter Millis for instance dis-
cusses American foreign policy
in about‘ 5000 words ending with
but a slight references to the fact
that ‘.‘it has shown little sign of
bringing a constructive contribu-
tion to the realization of the
“deeper and more permanent as-
pirations of the people whom it
represents; . . . few organs of
F policy official or unofficial seem
as yet to have taken much
thought for the future."

It Summarizes Gestapo

Free World gives excellent sum-
inaries of the work of the Ges-

, tapo, for instance, in Europe and

Latin America; but says nothing
‘of what to do with the living Ges-
tapo after the war. Norman An-
gell says “ﬁrst things ﬁrst;" but
this cannot be offered to a people
whose representatives in Congress
-say that to take the war effort
seriously would “repeal your eco-
nomic system."

Since the people are helpless
to control their efforts now, they
can at least .turn their attention
to post-war efforts, when the

. strict control of military life and

Playhouse and Players
Attempt Same Vehicle

Entertainment proposed for the
Pittsburgh Playhouse this season
places the accent on comedy!

Opening the season two weeks
hence will be “The Male Animal,”
one of the more entertaining com-
edies to come from the. profes-
sional stage in the past several
years. Pitt's large list of Play-
house supporters should ﬁnd this
tid-bit by James Thurber and El-
'liott~ Nugent especially entertain-
ing inasmuch as it deals with star-
ry-eyed student editors, bewild-
ered journalism professors, ~ and
explosive trustees. (Ed. Note:
For a preview of this attraction
stop any afternoon in the office
of our faculty adviser, Mr. Ma-
echcsney, Room 821CL). '

During November, as short
time before Pitt Players tackle
the same assignment, the Play-
house group will do “Flight to
the West" by Elmer Rice. This
is about as close as director Bur-
leigh's organization will get to
the more serious drama.

A Play in a Clipper

Mr. Rice has fashioned a play
rich in character portrayals done
amidst the setting of a trans-At-
lantic clipper. Comparison be-
tween the work of the semi-pro-
fessional group on Craft avenue
and that of the campus players
should prove to be major sport.
It is safe to assume that Buell
Whitehill, director of Pitt Play-
ers, will watch the reception ac-
corded the Playhouse production
with considerable interest.

“Out of the Frying Pan," an
innocuous little comedy that fail-
ed to make much of a stir in New
York last winter but which was
popular-on the summer theatre
circuitwill be the third produc-
tion for the Playhouse.

. Beginning with the Christmas

scatterbrained Mrs. North and her
husband who get tangled up in all
sorts of comic and mysterious sit-

uations. It had a creditable run
in New Y(Yl‘l( last year. The Pitt
Players, i cidentally, have also

been giving thought to a produc-
tion of this play, so it begins to
appear as though Mr. Burleigh and
Mr. Whitehill pass each other the
same scripts.

Excuse It, Sir Critic
“George Washington . Slept
Here," by George S. Kaufmann
and Moss l'lart,‘opens at the Play-
house, January 27. When this
show had its New York presenta-
tion, critics pointed out that
Kaufmann and Hart were enti-
tled to a weak job now and then,
for even Shakespeare had his les-
ser efforts. The play manages to
have some of Kaufmann's biting
satire, but its four month New
York run was achieved largely
by aid from the cut-rate ticket
agencies. ‘ r
In February, the Playhouse" peo-
ple will do Lynn Riggs’ “Green
Grow the Lilacs.” This is a folk-
play of the days when Oklahoma
was Indian Territory and was first
produced about a dozen years ago.
It came to the Nixon at that time
and had cinemactor Franchot Tone
in the cast, the first thing he did

5)

on the professional stage.

The Playhouse season comes to
what is hoped will be gay and lilt-
ing close with presentation of an-
other original musical. Charlie
Gaynor's last three revues have
been high-spots in the season, and
director Burleigh is conﬁdent that
he will come through with some
more of his sprightly satire.

It is an ambitious program the
Playhouse has in front of it. There
should be a full share of enter-
tainment in the offerings. Facul-

At the Nixon
Al Jolson is back! For the first

time in ten years he comes to a

Pittsburgh stage when his musical
show, “Hold on to Your Hats,”
opens at the Nixon tonight.

Twelve years ago black-faced,
mammy-singing Jolson deserted
the stage to have a fling at the
-movies. He did the screen version
of “The Jazz Singer," a picture
that had three profound effects
on the world's entertainment.

It was the first talkie that didn't
sound like somebody shaking
pebbles in a coffee pot. Itaspelled
the doom of every movie house
organist from Tin Pan Alley to
Timbuctoo, for it meant that hence-
forth and forevermore the screen
had a voice. It kept Al Jolson in
celluloid and off stage except for
one brief appearance in an or-
dinary musical called “Wonder
Bar,” more than a decade ago.
Lastly, it turned a nation of rug-
ged individualists into a mass of
dripping, sentimental “Sonny Boy"
singers. ‘

Now after all these years, Al
returns in‘the sort of entertain-
ment he used to do when he was
the merry minstrel of the stage.
lt's the typical musical show
plot, a convenient device’ on

fKorpantry, C43, to serve as inter-»
:‘p'reter.. From the mixture of Pol-
ish and English evolved an inter-
. eating chapter‘ of this young avi-
:ator’s life.

Trzcinski was born in New
LYork.’When he was five years
‘old he and his father sailed to
-Poland where he entered school.
 By the time Hitler's blitzkrieg
-ion Poland had been launched,
gfrzcinski had completed the third
Qjgyear of his course in a university
ifjin ‘Vilna, where he was’ major-
 in Economics and Political
“Science.

He left school immediately and
became a-ﬂier with the ‘Polish Air
,fiorce. One day the Nazis, sub-
jected his airdrome to a merci-
less rain of bombs and machine
 bullets. ' i

The pilots, helpless before the
dnslaught, abandoned the airﬁeld
and joined some Polish soldiers
who were retreating eastward.
Unfortunately, they escaped from
the German frying pan only to
land in the Russian ﬁre.

I A After several weeks imprison-

ment in a Russian camp, the Polish
. , ﬂiers, realizing that only one of
 their group had a chanceof es-
O I cape, chose Trzcinski since he had

A}!!! e r i c a n citizenship papers.
Séraping up every cent they had,
I they raised enough money to bribe
due of the Russians who allowed
Trzcinski to escape.

He immediately fled to Vilna
lwhere his citzenship papers were
kept. With them, he was able to
secure a passport from the Amer-

When asked whether he favored

he didn’t know much about base-

had trouble understanding the
Brooklynites. John, however, does

He asked me to send him copies

that he can follow the‘ exploits

promised to write to the News
when he is sent to England or
Russia. L

I noticed that he had an as-
tonishing number of pockets on
his uniform. We counted nine

in all. He denied that he needed

them to carry all his money but_

said. “I’m going to use every
one of ‘them to carry bullets for
the Germans when I get over on
the other side.”

By today he has already arrived

with hi's air corps in Canada.

For the future good of complex-

Pitt campus will go around for
the next three weeks with their
backs all stuck up with adhesive
tape. ' —

They a.rcn’t any old run-of—the-
mine backs, either, but ones spe-

cially selected by Dr. Henry T.‘

Smyth, senior industrial fellow at
Mellon institute.

Dr. Smyth is conducting a se-
ries of tests on student's skin, of
ingredients used in cosmetics and
lubricating oil which might create
irritation. . .

Odd combination, we admit, but
such results are brought about by
similar qualities in_the products.‘

Each man helping Dr. Smyth
in his study by offering his back
as testing gro'u)nd'is paid, $5. Six-
teen patches of the ingredients to
be studied are made on each
back. The spot is covered with
tape, and the man _is instructed
to remove the adhesive only if
the spot becomes Citchy or smarts.

William Seyler, C42, chairman

of the committee revealed that
outstanding labor leaders, educa-
tional leaders, and local political
ﬁgures also will appear as
speakers.‘ S

Hoping to serve the interests
and preferences of the general
student» body, committee members
recommended that topics of na-
tional or international scope will
form the basis of discussion, that
programs will be unbiased and ob-

.jective, and that student partici-'

pation will be encouraged since it
is one of the great values of PTM.

The patches are changed seven
times over a period of three weeks.
Small boys would love taking
the skin tests, because a tub bath
is out of the question for anyone
wearing the adhesive. Showers
are ok’d by Dr. Smyth, though.

The tests were made last spring,
also. Most of the men who re-
sponded then to the request for
backs were dental students. This
year, college men, medical stu-
dents, dents, and engineers all
came through in answer to Dr.

active elements to heal diseased '

V tissues (if the body. _
. This became a possibility today
after Dr. Aaron J. Rosanoff, na-
tionally known psychiatrist, an-
nounced that he would submit to
radio-active treatments under .the
powerful University of California
cyclotron in an attempt to heal a
rare and severe tumor which has

developed on his leg.

¢Tre,ats Tumor

He has already received some

 treatments under the cyclotron

since an operation last July, but
__as yet'there is no*definite indica-
ti.on.,o_f whether or not the tumor
will_be healed. Dr. Rosanoff
stated that he had more than a
50 percent chance ‘for recovery.
The radio-active elements pro-
duced by the California cyclo-

tron which at times generate
atomic bullets of 96,000,000
volts, the most powerful ever

produced by man, in some way
enter the blood stream of the in-
dividual undergoing the treat-
ments and focus on the affected
tissue in ‘approximately the same
manner as x-‘ray treatments.

Dr. Ernest : 0. Lawrence, 1935
Nobel prize winner for phycics
and his brother hope that the
cyclotron treatment will provide
the most powerful weapons
against cancer and tumerous
grows thatphave ever been dev-
eloped by modern science.

According to the theory un-
der which the cyclotron operates
the atoms of the element which

‘ are -being used are not actually

_smashed,,l)y direct impact of the
atomic bullet which the cyclo-
tron generates, but instead the
bullet merely becomes a part ‘of
the nucleus'- of the atom and
formsan entirely new atom. It
is, the new atom which is un-
stable and which gives off the
‘radiation’. -" ' 7

tro'n, which is expected to gene-
rate 1,000,000,000 volts.

This can be accomplished, Dr.
Lawrence claimed, through" the
use of neon, a much heavier gas
than has previously been tried..in
cyclotr.on work.

At present, carbon and hy-
drogen have been the most wide-
ly-used elements. Since carbon
nuclei are six times heavier than
those of hydrogen or helium,
they are able to attain energies
six times as great as the deu-
terons, Dr. Lawrence explained.
(Deuterons are the nuclei of
heavy hydrogen atoms" which
‘weigh twice as much as the atoms
of ordinary hydrogen.) ‘ *

As compared with the 1,000,-
000,000 v.olts which the new ’ Ca-
lifornia cyclotron will produce, the
Pitt cyclotron, which‘ is now‘ in the
process of construction, is not ex‘-
pected to reach more than 40,‘-

emphasized that the actual voltage
will not be known until the cyclo-
tron is actually inroperationg

Fumbles and a very inade-
quate aerial defense, blasted
Pitt's hopeslast Saturday aft-
ernoon of keeping their home.
opener record intact when
they lost a. listless 6-0 contest
to..a mediocre Purdue Boiler-
maker eleven. This was the
Panthers’ second defeat by at
Big Nine school in opening
tilts for they lost to the Ohio

State grid machine last year, 30-6.

 

Only in the ﬁrst quarter did
Coach Bowser’s boys show the of-
fensive power that was expected
of them, and then it lacked the all
essential scoring punch. The de-
fense of the local boys looked like
tissue paper at times, but usually
tightened up in time to prevent
anyfurther-scores. L . '

Pittsburgher John Petty, All-
Big Nine’”ful_lback,' scored the only
tally of_ thegame when he bullied
over-from the two-yard line after
a sustained drive from Pitt's 34-
yard line.

Not Enough Push

The Golden Panthers gave their
followers their only chance to
cheer as the initialistanza got un-
derway. ' Walter West, who played
a very brilliant game for Pitt at
quarterback, caught the opening
kickoff and brought it back to the
25-yard line. -Then with Jackie
Stetler’ and Bill‘ Dutton taking
turns going through the tackles,
and Johnny Ross piercing‘ the cen-
ter of the line, the Panthers reeled
oﬁ ﬁve ﬁrst downs up to the Riv-
eters 8-yard line.

With the ball on the 8-yard
line, Pitt had four downs iniwhich,
to reach the coveted territory.
Ross took the first crack at the
line, then it was Stetler’s turn,
then Dutton, and ﬁnally Ross
took another turn, but still the
ball Jlay two scant yards away
from a touchdown. Purdue kicked
out and Pitt's best sc6ring_ op-
portunity of the game was over.
Panthers Lose Special Delivery

It was at the end of the ,ﬁrst
quarter before the Mid-Westerners
got their first chance to show their
offensive power. Their runners
were speedy and their passes ac-
curate while Pitt put on a demon-

stration of loose ball handling. In .

all it was a miserable second quar-
ter for the local fans. A ~
The ﬁrst break in the game
came when right halfback Bill Dut-
ton fumbled the ball on his own
32-yard line. The Purdue ‘squad
took quick advantage of this as
John Petty tore off ﬁve yards at a
crack and ﬁnally put the ball over
the double stripe for the only
score of the game. 4
With Jones replacing Stetler
in the second quarter, Bowsei-’s
squad made a wild attempt to get
back in the ball game, but Jones
missed his receivers a little too of-
ten for Pitt to get into scoring

._,' ‘

Kliskey ‘

Kliskey stated that all those
reporting for practice will be re-
tained throughout the season re-

gardless of playing talent or the
lack of it. The fact that no high
‘school experience has been had
should not discourage any aspir-
‘ ing footballer from reporting
today. This point has been
brought up time "and time again
in the News, but it cannot be
stressed too often. Case after
case can be cited of boys who
never took part in athletics com«-
petitively until they reached col-
lege and then blossomed forth
into top flight stars.

, Equipment will be issued this
afternoon at the Stadium, eligibil-
ity and examination cards will be

World Series Wins
Over Pitt Gridders 

By SHEME BAZELL ,

It was a perfect day for base-
ball when Pitt and Purdue pre-
pared to mix it up_ on the Stadium
gridiron last Saturday, in the
first Panther‘ pigs‘-zin tussle of the
season. And the afternoon wasn't
completely devoid of the diamond
sport, as a goodly group of the
24,000 fans and fancttes decided
to divide athletic affection, by
listening to the llipsy doings of
tl.e Dodgers and watching the
somewhat disappointing display of
the Jungle Cats, at one and the
same time. ‘ .

Throughout the Stadium, port-
able radios echoedand re-echoed
a verbal acc'):'int of the World
Series activities in Flatbush. At
times, interest in the invisible, far
exceeded that shown by the spec-
tators for the visible action.

0 But around the Stadium, the
various reds, blues, and greens of
mlladfs attire, blended into the
colorful display that is so char-
acteristic of any gridiron gather-
mg.

Our, Team Is Red Hot??? -

ln front of the student section,
cheerleader Aldo Icardi and his
co-workers, were laboriously try-
ing to muster some verbal sup-.
port for the under-dog Panther
eleven. Only on two occasidns
were the boys able to get com-“
plete co-operation; first, as Stet-
ler left the field in the initial
period, after doing a lion's share
in the Blue and C-o_l_cl's frustrat.
ed goal-line march. And ﬁnally, as
the Panthers completed a pass
deep in Purdue territory, in a
belated attempt to tie the score
before the half whistle
sounded.

Ironieztlly, it was a Pittsburgh

time

territory.

Then Jones’ previously injured
knee collapsed, and the stellar
vwarrior had to be carried off the
ﬁeld. Stetler came back in the
ball game, and was on the reeciv-
ing end of Dutton’s long pass just
one minute before the half ended,
taking the ball to Purdue's 18-
yard line. But the clock and the
Purdue forward line proved a lit-
tle too much for the local football-
ers to overcome for the half ended
with Purdue on the long end of a
6-0 count. .
Local Boy Makes Good

Pitt came out on the ﬁeld with
revived hopes at the start of the

"fellow, John Petty, who contribut-
ed in a big way to the Panther
downfall. Petty’s consistently suc-

cessful line plunging brought the ‘V

Boilermakers out of. that first
period rut. And it was his all-‘
impcrtant push in the second
quarter that accounted ‘for the
only score of the game. i 1

Grady was an accomplished
merman when he entered the Uni-
versity of Michigan. But many
of the pointers he received from
the famous Matt Mann, have been
retained. And it is a well known
fact that Matt Mann is one of the
country’: outstanding coaches.

Probably most of the incentive
to be a champion, came from
Dick Degner, 1936 Olympic diving
champion. Degner, too, is a Mich-
igan alumnus, and the Panther
coach spent many an hour watch-
ing the Olympic champ rehearse
his specialty. .

Degner innovated many new
styles in springboard specialties.

Degner’s talents also had a hand in
the moulding of Grady’s career.
Gracly’s formula for those who
aspire to be a champion in any
sport, can be stated very simply:
W-O-R-K. Matt Mann has the
following sentence always pasted
on the bulletin board near the pool
in Michigan: “To be a champion,
one must PAY THE PRICE.” And
therein lies the answer. '
Coach Grady has the “winning
habit." In his first year as Pitt.’s
swimming mentor, the Cathedral
_ men came through with the East-
ern Collegiate Swimming, title.
Last year the Panthers ﬁnished
a surprising second. But Grady
hasn’t been trained to bat second,
and the Blue and Gold mermen will
definitely be battling for the crown
this coming season.

  At Meals---'Ma' VVill<ers

By ELAINE KAHN

Presumably the Panthers con-
cluded their training for Satur-
day's contest with Purdue when
they left the practice ﬁeld at 6:30
o’clock Friday evening. Actual-
ly, however, a most important, not
to say the most enjoyable, part. of
their training began at 7 o’clock
that evening when the players be-
gan to ﬁlter into the O’Hara St.
cafeteria for their supeI'viS€d CV9-
ning meal.

Diet is as important as exercise
in keeping a team in condition and
so, every evening Monday till Fri-
day throughout the football sea-
son, the gridders evening meal is
one that has been carefully plan-
ned by a dietician. During spring‘
training the boys were given
breakfast and lunch as well, but
once the season gets under way
only their dinner is supervised.

Mrs. Alice (“Ma” Wilkers to
“her boys”) has been guarding the
diets of Pitt footballers for the
past seven years. She has been
guarding Pitt diets in general for
the past 24 years.

The favorite food of the boys
is ice cream with chocolate sauce,
and chocolate cake. Cake
strictly taboo right now but ice
cream is still on the menu.

Typical of the meals served was
that given the boys before Satur-
day’s game. A A

The players had their choice of
broiled lamb chops, or broiled fish.
They were served baked potatoes,
fresh peas, tomatoes stewed with
