By Frances Sansig '
Staff Writer

Participants from as far away as
Oil City and Weirton, W. Va.
were on hand yesterday for the.
Sixth Annual Great Bed Race in
Schenley Plaza.

Coordinator Michael Podrasky
says the event was the first one of
its kind in the country. Thrift Drug

. Co. and Packard Press publishing
division co-sponsored the race to
benefit the Center for Emergency
Medicine of Western Penn-3
sylvania. .

The 13 teams that participate
this year consisted of volunteers
from various hospitals and am-
bulance services. Spectator turn-
out, however, was less than

expected.

”Due to the cool weather, it

was a smaller but extremely en-
‘ thusiastic crowd,” said Podrasky.

The theme for this year's race
was ”Once upon a time —- Fairy
Tales.” Groups of health care pro-
fessionals lined up for the open-
ing parade in Wizard of Oz,
Cinderella and Pied Piper
ensembles.

Mike Yee of the Pittsburgh
Paramedic Unit confessed that
”this is what happens to med‘
students when they graduate.”

The outfit from West Penn
Hospital, whose theme was the
Wizard of Oz, received the award
for the best looking float.-This is
the second consecutive year they
have taken the first—place award.

Tuxedoed representatives of the Oil City Area Health Center frantically charging to cross the finish line

Off to the races!

Medical community pushes beds

The Ohio Valley- General
Hospital emergency department,
who placed third for the best
decorated float, seemed more in-
tent on winning the race.

”We’re ’Mutiny on the Bounty,’
and Dr. Christian always wins his
battles,” said the captain of the
team. '

Keith Pucalik of the West Penn
emergency department revealed
that his team of Hamlin mice had
an edge. ”We’ve been working
out for a year ‘now, doing push-
ups and things," he said.

Erin McKinley and his group of
Cinderella coachmen from the Oil
City‘ Health Center explained their

~ reason for racing this year.
s ”We didn't have anything bet‘-
ter to do this afternoon — the

for charity

Steelers are playing away.”

Most teams were eager to point
out theyhad secret weapons. The.
Med Rescue Team South of Mt.
Lebanon said they had
retrorockets in their haystack. And
although another Cinderella team
said they were the only team with
magic dust, it turned out they
were wrong.

Dan Fisher of the Pittsburgh
Paramedic Unit said one goal was
survival. But the main goal was to
raise money for emergency
research. The award for the most
money raised this year went to
Presbyterian-University Hospital
dietary unit for their contribution
of over $1,000.

Ambassador reviews status of Ireland

By Doug Bennett

Staff Writer

Irish ambassador Padric MacI_(er—
nan spoke about Ireland's political

and religious past and the problems_

facing today's Ireland. MacKernan
spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of
nearly 200 in an address given Fri-
day evening at Frick Auditorium.

A native of Limerick, Ireland,
MacKernan is no stranger to the
world of diplomatic affairs. After
entering the Department of Foreign
Affairs in 1964, MacKernan began
serving as Irish consul general in
Boston and eventually captured the
post of consul general in New York.
MacKernan has been serving in his
current capacities since August,
1985.

Using a historical perspective,
MacKernan explored the depth and

complexity of Ireland's ‘problems. At’

the time of its formation in 1603,

Ulster consisted mainly of Irish PFC!’ ,
’ estants, with Anglos and Scotch

Presbyterians comprising the balance
of the population.

”The structure of the population
combined to make a potentially ex-
plosive society,” said MacKernan. To
this day, MacKernan explained,
Ireland remains a fervently religious

society, each group trying to wrest .

power and influence from the others.

Because of these powerful groups,
MacKernan concluded that a united
Ireland has been impractical, if not
impossible to attain.

A landmark step in Anglo—lrish rela-
tions was made with the bilateral ap-
proval of a recent treaty. MacKernan
praised the accord, viewing it as a

step toward eventual self-rule for

Northern Ireland.
He cited a _BBC_ Gallup Poll in

-which47 percent of those"-polled

to make a potentially

explosive society.
‘ — Padric MacKernan

favored the new pact. While

acknowledging the percentage as less

than a majority, MacKernan ex-
plained the results to be favorable in
light of the political diversity and
emotion surrounding the topic.
Beginning in March 1984, the talks
ultimately resulted in two major sum-
mits between prime ministers and

numerous _meetings_ of exterior

‘ ministers‘.

.-,,«

‘beginning of sweepin‘g‘ch_anges'. ‘

 

”The determination of both sides
[to forge an agreement] is what
ultimately brought them together.
Both governments aimed toward an
equal relationship between the

peoples and their countries,” he said.

‘Accagjjng to MacKernan, the major
provisions‘ irlflllded ‘the mutual
recognition and acceptaiiff Of each
others rights, as well as the right Of
the Northern Irelandcitizenry to ap-
prove or reject any changes in
governmental status.
MacKernan also discussed the
United States’ role in Ireland.
There has also been a substantial
amount of hindrance from America,
primarily in the form of. private
groups supplying arms to the Irish
Republican Anny and other terrorists.
MacKernan closed on an optimistic
note, describing the recent treaty as
an awakening of conscience and the

D TY rush I 
reducing  I
turnout 

 

By Dirk Kaufman

Fraternity presidents say the 1986
rush class is down from last year. Dry
rush is the cause and, according to
present members, there is a new ,
challenge in getting pledges. ‘ 

’’I think it's changed people's ap- 
proach to rush,” said Bob Kramer,-_~
president of Phi Gamma Delta. ”You  _ H
have to go to the freshmen instead of ' I’ ‘
them coming to you.” . V

When the decision was made to
have dry rush at Pitt, the activities of-  .,

others said they need more people to"

”When there's no alcohol, it's hard :.,
to attract people,” Greenberg said...
”When I rushed myself, it was to go
to a party, have a few beers and meet‘
some women. “ '

’’I think you're going to have at‘-“

but everywhere. Meeting the guys in

Though there are currently‘ in-‘ ,

they’ve made a commitment to do-

’’I hope we can live without beer
for two weeks,” said Bill Kokal, rush" .‘ 
chairman for the Triangle fraternity. S "
”If we can't, we should see the
school psychologist or something/"

Kokal said the dry rush means
more work for the fraternities.

’’It’s kind of scary in a way,” Kokal _
said. ”But, it's a lot of fun too. We‘  3'
have to show them that we're’ in- ,

Dry rush hurts

fraternity system

Animal House was a funny movie. It showed fraternity life as every

' brother dreams it should be. But, in truth, the Delta Tau Chi fraterni-

ty is nothing like any fraternity on this, or probably any other cam-
pus. You see, that movie was made so that people would laugh. Its

- purpose was not to portray fraternal life as it actually exists, neither

now, nor the time period in which the movie was set. It seems,
however, that too many people believe that the characters and situa-
tions in the movie belong in the non-fiction category.

The Office of Student Activities must be in this group of thinkers.
They have ordered, not requested or voted for, a dry rush for the IFC.
This means that there will be no alcohol served to men who attend
rush parties in the Pitt fraternity system. When asked why they had
come to this decision, the Office of Student Activities gave two general
reasons. First, they said that dry rush is the happening thing in frater-
nity systems across the country. Everyone is doing it, so why don't
we join in. The second reason they gave was that it is against the
law to serve alcohol to anyone under the age of 21 in the state of

* Pennsylvania.

Let's look at the first of their reasons. ”Everyone is doing it,” has
never been a motto of this university. Pitt has its own character, and
to go with the crowd would mean throwing away 200 years of tradi-
tion. The second reason is a little more credible. Pennsylvania state
law does prohibit anyone under 21 from drinking alcohol. But, to
every law there are exceptions. Fraternities have been able to serve
alcohol for years without problems.

This year's dry rush is the issue of discussion in fraternal circles.
It is not, however, the fact that fraternities won't be serving beer at
parties that offends brothers the most. It is that this proclamation was
issued in a tyrannical fashion. There was no democratic tally of opin-
ion, nor were there lots drawn. The IFC was deemed an alcohol abuser
and was penalized.

The history of fraternity systems shows the unique qualities of frater-
nities in their building of men with strong values. Fraternities were

I established to unite young men who had the same interests and goals.

To be in a fraternity was to be an elite. To gain entry, one had to
go through a rigorous indoctrination period. Then, once a brother,
he had to carry out the pledges he made to his fraternity and the values
on which it is based, in addition to excelling academically.

The standards for entry have relaxed over the years, but the dedica-
tion that unites a group of men, and really makes them a fraternity,
hasn't changed. Being in a fraternity, as in being in any other group,
gives a student the opportunity to learn through experience. As most
graduates will say, you learn more outside the classroom than in it.
If the members of a fraternity aretold what they can and cannot do,
then where does the learning occur? Mustn’t people engage in ex-
perimentation to learn?

There are too many people who think that alcohol at a fraternity
equates alcohol abuse at a fraternity. Yes, as fraternities will readily
admit, there have been incidents where rushees have become sick,
and in extreme cases even died due to alcohol abuse. Most of these
incidents happened in the '50s and '60s when hazing of pledges got
out of hand. The current resurgence of Greek life is due in part to
the abolishing of dated and dangerous pledging rituals. Pledges are
treated with respect and are welcomed to become a part of a
brotherhood. To welcome a prospective member of a fraternity with
a beer does not mean that the kid will get killed on his way home
from the party. It is only a way to let the kid know that he is accepted.
Few people go to fraternity parties just to drink. They go to talk with
people. They go to see if they'd like to be a member.

Why are fraternities treated like a third-rate group of drunks? Are
they always stumbling around campus with a beer in each hand? Of
course not. As far as the image of drunks goes, it has been members
of the fraternal system at Pitt who have established a group concerned
with drunk driving. Brothers Against Drunk Driving was established
in an effort to promote responsible alcohol consumption. They should
be allowed to establish their own regulations for rush parties. Hav-
ing rules shoved down their collective throat doesn't promote growth
or learning. How ’bout a little respect?

Babysitting fraternities
should be abolished now

I have a suggestion — abolish dry
rush.

Phi Gamma Delta was accused of
violating dry rush last week because
several members of the fraternity
tailgated in the parking lot of the Syria
Mosque prior to the Pitt-Maryland
game on Labor Day. Some freshmen
allegedly joined in on the tailgating,
and thus, dry rush was violated. That
is, to sum it up in one word,

‘ ridiculous.

First of all, if somebody told me
that I was not permitted to tailgate
before the Pitt-Maryland game, as
soon as I got done laughing, I would
tell that person to hit the road, and
not exactly in those words.

I have been at Pitt for three and
one-half years now, and I realize that
students join the Greek system for the
camaraderie, the good times and the
parties. Students don't join the Greek
system to have babysitters.

In a way, that is what dry rush
seems like.

The university needs to either
abolish dry rush completely, or go
back and re-evalute the rules and
regulations. Some of them are too.
vague. Here is an example: I am
over-21, and despite being a senior,
say I had registered for fraternity rush.

Drv Rush

I will never forget, at least for the
most part, the fall term of 1982. Here
I was, a freshman at Pitt on his own
for the first time. The atmosphere in
Oakland was electrifying: a new
home, a new roommate, a new be-
ginning. I felt as if the world were at
my fingertips — and I wanted it all!

Freshman orientation looked like a
great way to meet a lot of people, so
I diligently attended all of my men-
tor sessions. Bob Firth, the director
of new student programs, had
organized many events for us. They
included a watermelon picnic on the
Cathedral of Learning lawn where we
could meet all of the "Greeks/’

At the picnic, I was bombarded by
members of various fraternities, all
asking me if I had registered for rush
yet and then promptly inviting me to
the ensuing rush parties.

They promised free beer, beautiful
women and good times.

An IFC rush card was only $5, and
that was good for a free month of par-
ties. I know a bargain when I see one,
so I quickly registered for rush.

 

I am sitting in Peter's Pub one eve-
ning, and one of my friends, who
happens to be in a fraternity, buys me
a beer. Does that violate dry rush?

Dry rush rules state: Fraternities are
prohibited from purchasing or pro-
viding alcohol to any rushee through
any means at any time during dry
rush.

Sounds like I just got that fraterni-
ty in some trouble, doesn't it?

That is why alcohol should come
back to rush; Shift the responsibility

back onto the fraternities. Set bound-
aries as to how many alcohol parties
each fraternity can have during rush
and monitor those parties. Don't use
students as monitors either.

If an incident does occur at a frater-
nity, then call a hearing. If the frater-
nity is guilty, make them have dry
rush the following year while the rest
of the Greeks have wet rush. I don't
think too many students would attend
a dry rush function if the rest of the
fraternities were serving alcohol.

Dry rush should be used as an in-
timidating weapon, not as a restric-
tion on the students.

The argument against wet rush is
the fact that there are less incidents.
Well, there may turn out to be less
incidents, but there may also turn out
to be war between the fraternities.
Fraternity-A turns fraternity-B in.
Fraternity-B vows revenge, and thus,
the ball is rolling.

Another argument for dry rush is
that it is a trend across the nation.
Well, my mom always told me every
day before I left for school when I
was little, ”Be a leader, not a
follower.”

In other words, set trends — don't
follow them.

Dry rush has to go.

: an inside view

ROBERT
KRAMER

PIII GAMMA DEI.'I'A

A whole month of drunken
debauchery!

The old fraternity rush was, indeed,
crazy. I mean that from two points of
view. On the one hand, we would
hop from fraternity to fraternity,
meeting the brothers (if they could
talk), talking to their female guests
and drinking their free beer.

After visiting several houses in a
night, it was usually difficult to get
one’s bearings straight and get home
to the good ol’ Towers. The next
morning, I usually didn't want to get
up for class.

I now see things from a different
view. Where were the heads of our
fraternity leaders when the question
of underage drinking was posed?
Who took the responsibility for the
safety of returning guests? Who
stopped to think that hangovers aren't

 

conducive to studying?

Today, fraternities must deal with
a rush of a different sort. The attrac-
tion of free alcohol is gone. We must
ask ourselves what we can do to at-
tract pledges. '

Do we really need zoo parties and
the Animal House image to attract
rushees to our houses? I say, no.

We have a very marketable pro-
duct in our fraternities and sororities,
and there . is no need to rely on
alcohol. The times have changed.

We have to take a more serious ap-
proach to the meaning of the frater-
nity experience. Brotherhood should
be the selling point, not alcohol.

I feel that too many people use
alcohol as a crutch. The need to have
imaginative and fun rush events is
eminent.

Take that as a challenge. Use your
minds to create an atmosphere which
is both friendly and exciting. This will
show rushees that brotherhood is
more important than a big party.

It is the pursuit of common goals.
It is dedication. It is friendship.

THE PlTl' NEWS, Monday, September 8, 1986

It's up to you... Dee—troit... Deee-troit!   

We all have guilty pleasures in our
lives. Guilty pleasures are things we
love but are reluctant to admit that
we love, because other people might
think we are odd.

With some people, their guilty
pleasures are in the form of television
programs. They might, for example,
like to watch the TV faith healers per-
form their ”miracles,” but are embar-
rassed to admit it to their friends.
With other people, their guilty
pleasures are in the form of different
foods. They might like to eat liver but
aren't especially anxious to tell peo-
ple about that fact.

I have a guilty pleasure, and it is
more bizarre than most: I love
Detroit.

Yes, Detroit is my guilty pleasure,
and I'm not kidding. We all know
about Detroit's reputation. The
stereotype of Detroit is probably the
nastiest in the country; Detroit never

' quite got over its '60s and 705 im-

(5

(.3

age as Murder City, as a place of ex-
treme racialtension, as a dying part
of the Rust Belt that was destined to
lose jobs (and citizens) year after
yeah

People made jokes about Cleve-
land, but there were no Detroit jokes.
It was as if Detroit were too far gone
even to kid about.

I make fairly regular visits to
Detroit. In fact, I made one last week.
And I can honestly say that I have
never had a bad time there. There is
something about the city that flies in
the face of its national image. When
it turns out that I have to make
another trip to Detroit, I am filled
with a feeling of anticipation — the
way most people react when they
find out that they are going to Hawaii.

I like just about everything about

Detroit. I like the two newspapers. I ,

like the television stations. I like the
way the city is laid out — when
you're riding on the freeways you get
to 8 Mile Road, and it seems that 10
Mile Road is just a minute or two
away. Numbering the roads like that
makes the City seem more manage-
able than if you were looking for
streets with word names.

I like the fact that you can never
really tell when you are in Detroit
and when you are in the suburbs.
Maybe native Detroiters can do it, but
I never know when I have passed
from Dearborn into Detroit, or from

 

_ . ...
, . .

Detroit into Southfield. I like Tiger

Stadium, Cobo Hall and Joe Louis
Arena.

But most ofall I like the people. In
Chicago, where I live, we have
always been accused of having a Sec-
ond City complex, of behaving as if
no matter what we achieve, it is not
as impressive as it would be had we
only achieved it in New York. There
is a lot of truth to the Second City
complex. But, get this, in Detroit,-
people actually look up to Chicago!

Call it a Third City complex, if you
will, or a Tenth City complex.
Something about Detroiters smacks
of humility and, believe it or not,
kindness. As big and historic as the
city is, Detroiters always seem to feel
faintly apologetic about their town —
almost as ifthey have to make up for
all the bad publicity Detroit has
received over the years. There is
something charming about this.
Here's Detroit — supposedly tough
and gritty and on its muscle — and
you meet the people there, and
they're among the nicest in the
world.

Detroit will probably never
outgrow the bum rap it has about its
racial problems. But I'll tell you
something, if you hang around a city
for a while, you can get a feel for it
that tells you more than sociological
profiles and dry statistics. And what
I have always sensed in Detroit is that
whites and blacks have made a
grudging commitment to try to live
together in harmony. Obviously .it
doesn't always work, but in Detroit
I have noticed at least a surface
friendliness between the races that I
have seen lacking in cities that are

supposed to be much more en-
lightened.

It's probably no coincidence that
two of my favorite artists — novelist
Elmore Leonard and singer Bob Seger
— have chosen to make the Detroit
area their headquarters, even though
both of them have attainedenough
success and money to live virtually
anywhere in the world that they
might choose. They know that

Detroit is‘ one of America's best-kept’

secrets, and they're not willing to give
it up. ‘

I arrived in Detroit on an evening
during this latest trip. When I woke
up in the morning, the newspapers
told me that 12,000 municipal
workers were in the second day of a
strike against the city of Detroit. Five
thousand tons of trash were already
lying around uncollected, and the

papers speculated that unpleasant ,

days were ahead unless there was a
quick settlement.

Those are the kinds of facts about
Detroit that make the national news.
I can't help it, though; you know that
current best—se|ling novel, I'll Take
Manhattan? Well, I'll take Detroit.

Surely you have your own guilty
pleasures, too?

Questions to ask about Affirmative action    

Recently, there has been a lot of
talk about state house subcommittee
hearings regarding minority enroll-
ment and employment at state-related
universities. Apparently, Pitt's Affir-
mative Action and minority recruit-
ment programs have been doing only
an adequate job.

Hypothetically, Affirmative Action
programs do a world of good. Such
programs allow economically and
educationally disadvantaged minority
students to receive the rounded
educations they never would have
received without them.

Barbara Sizemore, a black studies
professor at Pitt, was quoted in The
Pitt News last Wednesday. In her ad-
dress to that subcommittee she said,
"The struggle for racial integration

The South

Anyone in search of a comprehen-
sive, up-to-date and unbiased assess-
ment of the current situation in South
Africa and the prospects for the future
need look no further than the report
of the Commonwealth Of Eminent
Persons Croupon Southern Africa.
Commissioned by the leaders of the
49 Commonwealth nations to ex-
amine the potential for meaningful
political dialogue in South Africa as
a means of averting a bloodbath in
that country, the EPG was co-chaired
by a former Australian prime minister
and a former Nigerian head of state,
and, included a former chairman of
the British Conservative Party, a
former Tanzanian foreign minister, a
former Indian cabinet minister, a
World Council of Churches and
former World YWCA president as
well as the primate of the Anglican
Church of Canada — hardly a bunch
of rabble-rousing extremists.

That such an impartial and respect- .

able collection of observers reached
the rather gloomy set of conclusions
about the prospects for government-
initiated change in South Africa and
came out so strongly in support of the
imposition of sanctions on Pretoria by

and nondiscrimination at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh goes on.” It's true
that integration here can be a strug-
gle, and that is a shame. Non-
minority students can become bitter

’ because of what they perceive to be

special treatment given to minority
students. Hence, the struggle.

The people behind Affirmative Ac-
tion programs know what they have
to do, and they go about doing it with
only the best intentions. But,
somehow, the good ideas behind
these programs get lost when put into
practice.

I have some questions about which
I would like you to think. I am not
passing any judgements. I want to en-
courage discussion, and perhaps
make the current system more
equitable for all parties involved.

 

ITAu|.iANkAr£it

Are minorities being recruited
because of their academic ability first,
and their ethnic background second?

Are efforts being made to recruit all
minorities equally, or is the emphasis
given only to those groups with the
strongest lobbies in Washington and
Harrisburg?

Why is there little or no mention
of groups other than blacks when of-
ficials refer tojminorities at Pitt?

Could it be that Hispanics and
American Indians, for example, are
less organized and therefore seen as
less of a threat, and recruited less
vigorously?

Are admission requirements re-
laxed in schools such as engineering,
so that Pitt can meet its minority

. enrollment quotas?

When preparing to admit a new
class, are percentages of enrolled
minorities projected first, thereby
reserving space for minority students

who may never apply?

Are non-minorities hurt by Affir-
mative Action? ’

How do you feel about the ques-
tions I've posed? I'll probably be
branded a racist for this column, but
I don't see it that way. This column
is realistic, not racist. —

The definition of racism is
discrimination based on race. Putting
minority concerns before those of
non-minorities is racist. Ignoring
minority concerns is also racist. It's
a double-edged sword and, in the
end, no one wins. The only way to
be nondiscriminating is to judge all
students on their academic creden-
tials and nothing else. When people
stop putting skin color over mental
ability racism will be stamped out
and we will be truly integrated.

African dispute continues to rage on

the international community is, in
itself, enough to make one wonder
about the soundness of those in the
U.S. and British administrations who
vehemently oppose measures such as
those approved by the House and
Senate during the last few months.

When asked at a recent p'ress con-
ference what the rationale is behind
a no-sanctions policy towards South
Africa while his administration is

~ levying sanctions against the govern-

ment of Nicaragua, President Reagan
stated that the major difference be-
tween the two offending nations was
that Nicaragua posed a threat to its
neighbors while South Africa's sins
were of an internal nature. This, com-
ing at a time when South African
troops are camped deep inside
Angolan territory backing a group of
"freedom-fighters”. by burning and
stealing crops, bombing crowded
marketplaces, vandalizing develop-

ment projects, kidnapping foreign

civilians, placing mines in villagers’
paths to their fields, and killing and
maiming thousands of those whose
freedom they supposedly seek. This
happened while the South African
government continues to support in-

TENDAYI
MIIDAWARARA

surgent movements in Mozambique
and Zimbabwe -- as a means of de-
stabilizing the governments of those
nations. This happened just a few
weeks after South Africa launched the
latest in a series of coordinated
ground and air assaults on Botswana,
Zambia and Zimbabwe —— a few
months after they used economic
strong-arm tactics (the same measures
they profess to be so strongly op-
posed to) to bring down the govern-
ment of defenseless Lesotho. And,
despite all this, Reagan would have
one believe that South Africa poses
no threat to its neighbors?

Indeed, the most ironic thing about
the sanctions debate is the fact that

- South Africa continues to use sanc-

tions against the other nations of
Southern Africa. Partly due to a cruel
twist of‘ nature and partly to
deliberate actions of those who col-
onized the region, the entire
Southern African subcontinent finds

itself in the unfortunate position of
being extremely vulnerable to the ac-
tions of the Pretoria government. At
first glance, this would seem to sup-
port the much-used argument that
sanctions against South Africa would
be detrimental to that country's
neighbors. However, just as EPG

concluded-in its report, since South‘

Africa is already exploiting the
vulnerability of its neighbors in order
to strengthen itself by weakening
them, the imposition of economic
sanctions on South Africa as a means
of effecting the demise of the present
system there would benefit the entire
region.

Prime Minister Mugabe of Zim-
babwe, who (together with President
Kaunda of Zambia) has been at the
forefront of the international cam-
paign for sanctions, said: "We would
go for sanctions because they would
shorten this burden of economic suf-
fering.  the goal [self-determination
for all in South Africa and stability in
the region] would be foreseeable.”

Botswana's vice president added:
"The abolition of apartheid could be
the greatest single contribution made
to the economic development of the

region."

During the last few weeks, Zim-
babwe and Zambia have proceeded
with the impositionof the measures
agreed to by the Commonwealth
(with the exception of Britain). As ex-
pected, the Pretoria government has
retaliated with a series of intimidatory
tactics, including the deliberate delay
of transit traffic to and from the two
nations, and increased support to
anti-government rebels in Mozam-
bique (the only alternative route to
the ocean for imports and exports
from Zimbabwe). In the hope that
perhaps he would see the regional
impact of his no-sanctions policy first
hand, the leaders of the Southern
African frontline states have recent-
ly invited President Reagan to visit
the area, but Reagan apparently "can-
not find the time.” One wonders
whether it is indeed a matter of hav-
ing no time, or whether he is just un-
willing to open his eyes to the reality
of the: situation. Whether or not
Reagan goes to see it for himself, the
reality of the situation is quite clear:
Apartheid in South Africa poses a
serious threat well beyond its
borders. '

ETHE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 3, 1986

By Rebecca Clothey
For The Pitt News

Honors students from Pitt and
Chatham College will be living
together this year as part of a proj-
ect studying life in a post-
industrial society.

”It is a mutual benefit here,"
said Alex Stewart, dean of Pitt's
Honors College. "A living, learn-
ing experience is an interesting
opportunity.”

Students will live at Dilworth
Hall on the Chatham campus and
still attend classes at their respec-
tive schools. However, they will
be required to take a course on
life in a post-industrial society

taught by Peter Machamer from
Pitt's department of history and
philosophy of science, and Linda
Rosenzwieg from Chatham’s
department of education.This is
the first time the class has ever
been offered.

Students will attend weekly din-
ners and lectures by various
speakers dealing with post-
industrial society. The first lecture
will be given by Ted Windt from
Pitt's department of com-
munication.

”We can make use of the time
students spend in the dorm by
bringing in guest speakers,” said
Machamer.

Stewart explained why they
chose the theme ’’life in a post-

Life in a post-industrial society is something we
all have to deal with.

industrial society.”

”We wanted a theme that
would have a wide appeal
because we wanted a diverse
group of students to be able to
participate,” he said. ”And life i_n
a post-industrial society is
something all of us have to deal
with. This is a post-industrial
society.”

— Alex Stewart

Machamer said the idea came
from assistant dean of Pitt's
Honors College, Arlene Seal:

”We wanted to come up with
a topic to provide intellectual
thought about what's going on in
today's society," Machamer said.

Some of the topics that will be
covered in the course will be
media and the influence it has on

society, and changes within fami-
ly and lifestyle. The course is built
around five short papers and one
research paper, Machamer said.

The 30 students accepted into
the program will not be required
to pay additional charges beyond
their school's normal tuition and
room and board.

’’I think one of the exciting
things about it is that it represents
a collaboration between two
schools in Pittsburgh.” said
Stewart.

”We do a lot of talking about
collaborating, but we do more
talking than doing. We'll have to
see how it goes. Everything we do
for the first time is a pilot opera-
tion.”

tonight, and each sorority has a dif-
ferent theme for each.

Tomorrow at invitation pick-up
mutual selegtion will be made. The
sororities choose the girls whom they
want to invite back, and the girls
choose the sororities to which they
would like to return. By Wednesday
the rushees must narrow their
choices to four of the sororities that
invited them back. Once again the

rushees will attend parties at these‘

four sororities.

’’If they come back to your party,
then you know that they are inter-
ested in your sorority, and this shows
us if they really want ingour sorori-

choose? Or which sorority will
choose them? On Thursday, Sept. 11,
the rushees will attend the invitation

sorority really wants them.

On Friday, Sept. 12, the rushees
will attend parties at two of the
sororities that invited them back, and

sions based on the sororities that they
feel most comfortable with,” said
Barb Clauson, rush chairman. ”Some
girls are more comfortable in a small
sorority rather than a big one.”

Finally the anticipated day arrives.
Saturday, Sept. 13, is pledge night,
also referred to as ”ribboning,” when
the rushees will be welcomed as new
pledges to one of Pitt's fine sororities.

.”We really don't try to get the girls
to think that any one particular sorori-
ty is better than the rest. We want to
get them into the Greek system and
let them feel like they have a home

Monday, SEPTEMBER 8, I98

  

Despite an illness, Lisa Stewart was one of the stars for Pitt this weekend, as they placed second in the Villanova Classic.

Ya know who really stinks?
The NCAA, that's who. The past

NCAA spends a month on trivial pu

two weeks is a perfect example of the -

ineptitude, the inequity and the sim-
ple folly that is the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association.

First the Duquesne University
athletic administration is informed its
teams will be ineligible to compete
in NCAA sponsored, post-season
tournaments. That is basically the
same punishment the NCAA hands
out to all its criminal schools. So what
did Duquesne do? What hideous
crimes were committed on the Bluff?
Payoffs to poor kids who run fast and
jump high?

No. Huh—uhh.

Then ‘it must have been that Du-
quesne players were involved in a big
drug scandal like the one ' at
Maryland.

No. Huh—uhh.

Then it would have to be that Du-
quesne boosters got bl'ow—off summer
jobs for players like they did at SMU.

Wrong again. What Duquesne did
was much worse — or at least just as
bad. The NCAA thinks so, anyway.

Duquesne was guilty of not having
enough swimmers and women track
runnefs at a few meets last year. This
meant that at the meets Duquesne
was short performers; the Dukes had
to forfeit. The end result was that the
swimming and track teams did not

 

non mnvans.

' does not fit the crime. Why should,

compete in enough meets to "qualify
as having completed a sanctioned
NCAA Division I schedule.

If Duquesne had, say, 50 teams in
50 sports, none of this would matter.
But the NCAA rules clearly state that
any institution wishing to compete at
the Division I level must field at least

‘ eight men's and six women's teams.

Duquesne fell short of this require-
ment and is now, being punished.

The fact that Duquesne violated an _

NCAA rule is not the question. The
rule is clearly stated‘ and the Dukes
clearly violated it. Is this__clear? I
didn't. think so. . .
The issue is that the punishment

all of Duquesne’s teams be punish-
ed because two minor athletic teams

The Lady Panther volleyball team

has a point to make this season. Over; if

a year ago, Pitt was ranked 17th. The

team was consistently plagued by in- j .l

juries and robbed of a chance to play
in the NCAA tournament in 1985.
Following an intense and highly

motivating month of practice, the .

volleyball team committed
themselves to proving that Pitt is No.
1. Devoid of a national seed the Lady

Panthers opened the 1986 season at 

the Villanova Classic.
Though defeated by archrival Penn
State, Pitt walked away with second

place and victories over Villanova,

defending Big East champion Pro-

vidence and Cal State at Irvine.
Pitt opened against host Villanova,

beating them 15-8, 15-5 and 15-2.

Then, the Nittany Lions handed Pitt

, a temporary setback with a 3-1 loss. .
(The Lady Panthers have two moie T "
chances this season to avenge this 
loss.) Pitt turned around and defeated . .' V

the same Providence team that beat

them out of the Big East title last —.

season.

As Coach Collier noted, ’.’This was '

a big win for us. Providence returned
five of its six starters this year. In order

for us to prove Pitt is No. 1 in the Big 1

East, we needed to beat Providence.

I think we did so quite convincingly ,

with the three-match win.” -
Cal State at Irvine was the next to

fall in the Lady Panther’s path. Pit,t7='l_.jj
lost the first match 13-15, but fought '

back to sweep the next three, 15-11,
15-9 and 15-9. Traditionally Califor-
nia teams are among the best in the

~ nation.

”Natural|y when any team from the
East beats a team from California, it's
a feather in their cap,” stated Collier.
”One of the reasons we came to this
tournament was so we would be

matched with a team from California. , 
We played strong matches with Cal '

State at Irvine. This game provided us
with the confidence that we can beat
Santa Barbara in our first home match
[Sept. 19]." "

The victory over Cal State was cer- '

tainly a big step towards being ab_le
to defeat the very elite Santa Barbara
team later this month. A ,

Senior captain Sue Hoover led the
team with 51 kills, showing the form
that earned her the Big East Player-
of-the-Year award last season. Stand-
out senior Kris Wexell, though the
shortest Lady Panther (5’4”), had a

very strong weekend. Deemed the »

”glue that holds the team together?’
by her coach, Wexell is expected to
have another exceptional season.

when a person commits a crime, they 2

throw his whole family in jail. That's
the way a democracy works. ;
But then again, who ever said the

...and now Dr.

John Riggins. Starting quarterback Jay
Shroeder is quite young and inex-
perienced, but he played admirably
last season after Theismann went
down in the 1 1th game. His progress
is steady, and that is welcome news
to the Redskin’s faithful. Should he
falter, the veteran Williams is on
stand-by. If coach Joe Gibbs gets a de-
cent performance out of his aging
defense, he will again field a com-
petitive playoff team. 11-5.

Fans of the Dallas Cowboys are
thinking, even guaranteeing, a Super
Bowl appearance since the surprising
arrival of the great Herschel Walker.
But a top-notch tailback they already
possess in Tony Doorslam, pardon,
Dorsett, and one too many egos spoil
the Texan chili. Battered QB Danny
White has seen his day and won't
lead the Cowboys much further than
the locker room.

Tom Landry's defense is struggling,
timid and on the verge of collapse.
Last season, Cincinnati, San Francisco
and Chicago ran up a combined total
of 125 points against them. Dallas
isn't that bad of a team, but some
relatively drastic changes will have to
be made before the ’Po_kes are again

Ron Jaworski on his toes and, oh yes,
brought in the NFL’s most celebrated
assistant coach, Buddy Ryan, to take
the controls. Toss in some excellent
receivers and a stingy defense and
voila! — a mediocre, but much im-
proved Eagle team. Give them a few
seasons before they're 12-4, good
buddy. 8-8.

The St. Louis Cardinals were, by
far, the biggest disappointment of
1985. Picked by many experts to
reach the Super Bowl, they crash
landed somewhere outside of game
two and wound up a paltry 5-11.

Then the commonplace sequence
occurred: Owner fires coach. Owner
hires coach. New coach employs get-
tough standard and vows to build a
winner. This time it's Gene Stallings,
the former Cowboy assistant, at the
helm of the still-talented Cardinals.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 8, I986

With the addition of UCLA star John
(Accurate) Lee, St. Louis now has a
kicking game, something that hasn't
thrived there sincejim Bakken retired
in 1979. With names like Neil
Lomax, Roy Green, Otis Anderson
and E.J. Junior on the roster, the
potential to be great is indeed pres-
ent, but so is the memory of last
year's disaster. Stalling should bring
them around soon enough. 6-10.

The Chicago Bears were perhaps
thefinest, if not the most dominating,
football team ever fielded. But most
football analysts and experts aren't
picking these warlords to repeat.
Well, why not? The talent is certain-
ly still ripe. Injured starters Leslie
Frazier (CB) and Dennis McKinnon
(WR) are gone for the season, but
have easily been replaced in the
lineup by Reggie Phillips and Ken
Margerum, respectively. No loss
there. Vince Tobin, the’ defensive
coordinator hired after the sudden
departure of Buddy Ryan, has
changed the defense to a more con-
ventional 3-4, but will still use Ryan's
high-pressure 46 ”D” on many oc-
casions.

The players seem to like Tobin and
should respond positively to his
alterations. All-Pro safety Todd Bell
is back with the team after a one-year
hiatus over contract problems. What
else could be right about this team?

   

If the Bears are as hungry as Coach
Mike Ditka says they are, then the
NFL will have its first double-take of
the '80s. Most analysts are guessing,
as recent trends have revealed, that
they are not. 11-5.

The Green Bay Packers are ready
to move ahead of the Joneses, and it's
about time. This team has been
stockpiling talent for several years,
yet has charted an 8-8 record four of
the last five seasons. The unpleasant
quarterback situation apparently has
been settled, with former Wisconsin

star Randy Wright beating old-time .

vets Dickey, Zorn and Ferragamo.
Wright's receivers are the tremen-
dous trio of James Lofton, Phil Epps
and tight end Paul Coffman. Newly
acquired RB Kenneth Davis of TCU
will bolster the rushing attack. A
talented, steady defense always
helps, and the Pack does have one
indeed. Only a killer schedule and
the disadvantage of being in the same
division as Chicago will sack the
Packers. 9-7.

Darryl Rogers of the Detroit Lions
quickly establishing himself as one of
the better coaches in the league.
Despite the terrible rash of injuries
that the Lions have suffered over his
two-year tenure, he has kept them
quite respectable, sometimes
dangerous and practically invincible

NCAA  

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, September 8, I986

 

continued from Page 13
The NCAA got wind of a rumor

" that said some Nebraska football
‘ players were not giving their com-

plimentary game tickets to authorized

I  persons only. The NCAA then asked
-. Nebraska to conduct its own in-

vestigation into the matter. Nebraska
did and turned in 77 names to the
NCAA, players who may have
violated ticket rules. The NCAA in-
vestigated the Nebraska investigation
— isn't this fun —— and found 60 Corn-
huskers to be in violation of the rules,
so they ordered the 60 suspended for
one game in 1986.

Nebraska had a choice: either sus-
pend all 60 players for one game, sus-

pend 10 per game for six games, or
pick Door No. 3.

But a funny thing happened on the
way to the investigator's office.
Nebraska head coach Tom Osborne
indicated he would rather have all 60
suspended for one game, the first
game of the year. Playing without 60
athletes is the equivalent of forfeiting,
and that is exactly what Osborne said
he would do. It just so happened that
the Nebraska opener was against
Florida State, a game to be broadcast
on national television during prime
time by ABC.

Thus, ifthe suspension held forth,
the game would not be played. No

game, no people, no profits for ABC.
Miraculously, the NCAA granted
Nebraska a stay just in the nick of
time. Luckily the game was able to
be played and the question of
whether the Nebraska 60 — not to be
confused with the Chicago 8, who
weren't nearly as quick —— will be
suspended is to be answered
tomorrow.

It is beyond me as to why players
who are given complimentary tickets
are not allowed to hand them out to
whomever they darn well please. The
rule states a player is permitted to
give his comps to only family
members or students.The NCAA,
never a very mystic organization, ap-
parently wasn’t referring to the fami-

Iy of man or the notion we are
students of life. So if you play for
Nebraska and your girlfriend goes to
Arkansas or somewhere, she can't go
to the game. Unless, of course, she
gets her tickets off a scalper, who
probably got his off a booster, who
probably got his as a comp from the
university. There is a very strange sort
of karma about all this, isn't there?

The whole point is this — why does
the NCAA waste its time on such
stupid, trivial, petty stuff like the Du-
quesne and Nebraska violations?
These schools did violate: the rules,
but let's get real about the
punishments. The penalties in these
cases do not ﬁt the crime. In fact, they
don't even come close.

at the Silverdome. Had he a young
Billy Sims (who has since retired) to
turn loose in his backfield, the Lions
would be at least a nine-win football
team.

That is not the case. Even though
they did pick up some quality players
in the draft — namely Iowa quarter-
back Chuck Long — Detroit will con-
tinue to be an average squad in the
short run. 8-8.

The Minnesota Vikings have their
third head coach in as many years in
Jerry Burns, the former defensive
coordinator under the semi-legendary
Bud Grant. That proves to bevenough
instability for any team, including the
Vikings, who have fallen from the
NFL’s elite to lower-middle class. The
Vikes are under-manned in almost
every area, except the defensive
backfield where Keith Nord and Joey
Browner roam. Both lines are weak,
although the offensive will get a
boostwith ex-USFLer' Gary Zimmer-
man lending his high-priced services.
QB Tommy Kramer is pretty decent
at his trade, but will need more pro-
tection if he's to get the ball to
burners Anthony Carter - and Leo
Lewis. Viking tradition will pull out
a few games for Minnesota this year,
but Burns still has his work cut out
for him. 6-10.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, September 8, -I986

 

Sayiit ain't so, Bo. Thousands of
Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans were
heart broken when Heisman Trophy
win‘ner Bo Jackson decided to give
baseball a try, spurning the Bucs’
multi—million dollar offer. With a
Jackson, James Wilder and Steve
Young backfield, Tampa would have
possibly had the best threesome in
the NFL. Oh, what could have been.

Now the Buccaneers are back to
the point they were last year, only
one year more experienced. The
April draft yielded other potentially
great players who did sign, namely
DB's Roderick Jones and ‘Craig
Swoope, linebackers Kevin Murphy
and Jackie Walker and tackle J.D.
Maarleveld. Standout lineman Lee
Roy Selmon retired over the summer,
weakening an already bad defense.
And to think this team, only seven
years ago, was 10 points away from
the Super Bowl. 3-13.

Bluntly, the San Francisco 49ers
going to be one helluva football
team. After last season's injury-
plagued, 10-6 _disappointment, Bill
Walsh will assuredly have his troops
aimed at the Super Bowl like a heat-
seeking missile. The recent acquisi-
tion of speedy Joe Cribbs from the
Buffalo Bills will really ignite the
already explosive rushing attack.
Cribbs will be teamed with Roger
Craig, Wendell Tyler and rookie
fullback Tom Rathman.

Joe Montana has an outstanding of-

fensive line and an equally explosive
fleet of receivers in Dwight Clark,
Jerry Rice and Mike Wilson.The on-
ly trouble spot should be at the cor-
nerback position. 13-3

The Los Angeles Rams have an ag-
ing, injury-prone quarterback to lead
them into battle. So what else is new?
The latest Ram over-the-hill project
is ex-Falcon Steve Bartkowski.
Elsewhere the Rams are loaded to the
brim. Their defense is spectacular,
especially in the secondary, where
JohnnyJohnson, Jerry Gray, Leroy Ir-
vin and Vince Newsome dish out
plenty of jarring blasts.

The passing must develop to take
the heat off running back Eric Dicker-
son. 11-5. ’

The Atlanta Falcons are not a good
football team. Onlytheirirushing at-
tack. is considerd dangerous where
All-Pro Gerald Riggs leads the charge.
Every other aspect of the team is
weak. The Falcons are quarterbacked
by David Archer, an Iowa State grad
who had few shining moments last
year. The defense is a wreck, but
draftees Tony Casillas and Tim Green
should help immensely. 5-11

If the Falcons are ”bad," what does
one call the New Orleans Saints?
New head coach Jim Mora says the
word is ”impressive.” New Orleans
may be a sleeper this year.
