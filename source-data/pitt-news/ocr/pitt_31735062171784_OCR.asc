Universities Retain
‘State-Related’ Status

by BILL GORMLEY

Chancellor Wesley Posvar
and the Presidents of Penn
State and Temple appear to
have thwarted an attempt by a
special task force to end the
special status of “state-re-
lated" universities like Pitt.

The three Presidents, who con-
ferred with Governor Milton
Shapp in Harrisburg last Mon-
day. discovered then that a spe-
cial task force was on the verge
of recommending to the State
Board of Higher Education a radi-
cal change in the state's system
of support for higher learning.

According to Steele Gow. spokes-
man for the administration. the
task force was about to suggest
that "we abandon institutional
support and go entirely to a state
scholarship plan." If incorporated
into the state's Master Plan for
Higher Education and enacted
into law, such a proposal would
have effectively ended Pitt's stat-
us as a state-related university.

“The state’s public institutions
were caught by surprise by the
task force,” Gow revealed late
last week. He said, However, that
the three Presidents succeeded in
“stalling” the recommendation.

Before leaving for a conference
of state college presidents, which
took place in Hershey yesterday.
Chancellor Posvar expressed con-

fidence that the heads of the’

state's colleges and universities

   

would agree on a “common ap-
proach."

"I think support for the idea of
a radical change in the state's
funding system has diminished
considerably," he observed Fri-
day. While sympathetic to the
plight of the state's private col-
les. Posvar nevertheless argued
that abolishing “state-related“
universities is not the answer.

The task force's proposal, Pos-
var contended, “would have re-
duced incentives for quality pro-
grams.” ‘

Without direct state aid to col-
leges and universities. he main-
tained, Pennsylvania's institu-
tions of higher learning would find
themselves “competing for stu-
dents on a lowest cost basis."
Posvar raised the specter of uni-
versities curtailing services to
keep tuition low to fare better in
the “marketplace" of higher ed-
ucation.

Speaks on Drugs, Prison

Spector Seeks Reform

by STEVE ZYCH

“The prisons are breeding
grounds for crime,” stated Phil-
adelphia District Attorney Arlen
Specter, who came to Pitt Thurs-
day night to speak about drugs
and prison reform.

“The prisons do not rehabilitate,
and crime rates for prisoners
when they are freed are high."
noted Specter, who pointed out
that over 50 per cent of them re-
peat.

“There is very little counseling,
psychiatric help or job training
being conducted in our prisons to-
day and the medical care is often
poor," he added.

His recommendation for a bet-
ter correctional system included
(I) Smaller correctional units;
(2) Group therapy; (3) Relevant
vocational training) (4) Halfway
house programs where the con-
vict works during the day and re-
turns to prison after work; (5)
More judges and modern techno-
logy to ease the “staggering court
backlog”; (6) More probation and
parole officers, as most of them

are overloaded, and better train-«

ing for them; (7) Separate deten-
tion facilities for juveniles and
those awaiting trial.

Among the reasons for lack of
reform are “lack of cooperation
among state. local and Federal
governments and the ignorance of
the public."

In regards to the present mari-

 

   
   

juana laws, Specter predicted that
they will probably be reformed in
the state after the present finan-
cial crisis is ended. “Pot busts
have a low priority in law en-
forcement and among the judici-
ary,“ he said.

Specter went on to point out
that most drug convictions is his
district involve the hard drugs
like heroin and cocaine.

In response to a question con-
cerning present prison reform
legislation. Specter stated that
“no such bills are moving in the
state legislature. though many
have been introduced. They (the

"Besides." he added, "it's a
matter of equity." State aid to
Pitt. Penn State, and Temple is
“just and sensible." Posvar ar-
gued. because “the public bene-
fits that accrue from higher edu-
cation exceed those that accrue
to the individual."

According to Posvar, most of
the state’s private college heads

agree that state aid to state-re-

lated universities should be con-
tinued.

Posvar, in turn. agrees with at
least one recommendation made
by the task force: that the State
Council on Higher Education—a
division of the State Board -
should be empowered to veto a
proposal by a state-related uni-
versity for a new school or de-
gree-granting unit.

Asked whether such a veto
would amount to an infringement
on the university's autonomy,
Posvar replied, “No.” He said
Pitt “shouldn't have the right to
present a fait accompli to the
State Legislature."

Sweeping all three relay events
and setting a new world indoor
record in the process, the Pitt
track squad ran away from the
rest of the field at the Delaware
Invitational Track and Field Meet
on Saturday. Although team totals
were not kept, Pitt Coach Jim
Banner's men romped over the
opposition, which included Penn
State, Delaware. Manhattan.
Georgetown, Temple, West Vir-
ginia. St. John's and C. W. Post.

The distance medley quartet of
Ken Silay (1:54), Smittie Brown
(48.2). Mike Schurko (22573).
and Jerry Richey 13:59.7) crack-
ed the existing world indoor stan-
dard (9:42.6 by William & Mary)
by nearly three seconds with a
9239.7 clocking.

Silay. who ordinarily does not
run in the distance medley. took
John Aiken's place Saturday at
Delaware so that the latter could
qualify for the 1000-yard run this
weekend in the IC4A's at Prince-
ton.

Trustees °Contact’ Union Carbide

Nader Denied Proxy

by CAROLE COVAL

University Treasurer David
Smith said Thursday that the
proxy voting privilege that Ralph
Nader had requested concerning
the 10,200 shares of Pitt-owned
Union Carbide stock was denied.

Smith said that University Trus-
tees could not legally delegate
voting power. but had directly
contacted the management of Car-
bide to express concern and as-
certain future environmental po-
licy. ,

In a letter to Marc Hiller. co-
ordinator of Environmental Ac-
tion—Zero Population Growth.
Smith wrote, “The University is
perfectly willing to make rec-
ommendations to management
for improvement in policy when
it is felt that changes would be in
the best long-term interests of
both the corporation and the pub-
lic.

“Should events lead the Univer-
sity to question its confidence in
management, it will take appro-
priate action, including further
consultation with management,
to resolve any doubt and, failing
.this, will dispose of the security.”

Hiller expressed his dissatis-
faction with the trustees‘ deci-
sion, saying the Investment Com-
mittee should initially view pros-
pective stock purchases in terms
of the industry’s devotion to social
injustice and environmental de-
gradation.

“If they would apply pressure,
without giving Nader's organiza-
tion the proxy vote from the Un-
ion Carbide stocks, it may have an
effect," Hiller said. “But I don't
know."

Nader’s organization, the Cen-

place in the 1000 yard run, there-
by assuring himself of a spot in
the IC4A’s' in that event, team-
mate Rick Carosielli gained a
berth in the NCAA indoor cham-
pionship at Detroit with a time
of 7.4 in the 60 yard high hurdles
at Delaware, good for second
place.

’ Two Pitt marks were also shat-
tered on Saturday. Bill Rea set an
indoor record in the long jump
with an effort of 24 feet, one-half
inch. And running the country's
fourth fastest time of 1971, the
two-mile relay team lowered the
Pitt mark by exactly two seconds
with a 7:3-1.6 clocking.

Despite Rea‘s record—breaking
jump, he finished one-half inch
behind the winner in the long

jump.

After running a sub-four min-
ute mile in the distance medley,
Richey came right back to an-
chor the record-setting two mile
relay quartet. Silay’s. 1:5-1.3,
Schurko’s 1254.5 and Aiken’s

cational institutions, including
Pitt and the University of Penn-

proximately $11 million. With this.

voting authority, Nader’s organ-
ization could attempt to rectify
the questionable environmental
practices.

In a letter to The Pitt News,
Nader said, “Union Carbide has
contaminated the Ohio Valley
from its Marietta plant with
246.350 pounds of sulfur dioxide
and 44,586 pounds of particulate
matter each day. “

According to Mark Hiller, Gov-

ernor Milton Shapp “exressed ex- .

treme concern” about the Union
Carbide issue. Shapp was the key-
note speaker this past weekend
at the Pennsylvania Environmen-
tal Conference held in Philadel-
phia.

“Governor Shapp wants to sit
down at length with those con-
cerned persons from the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania and Pitt,”
Hiller said. “He is also contacting
Ralph Nader,” he added.

Hiller admitted that he was pes-
simistic prior to Shapp’s re-
sponse. “I expected a comment,
or an agreement,” Hiller said,
“but not any immediate action.

“Because he made the response

   
 

 

  

that he did, despite the fact that ' -

he was rushed for time after the
speech, I feel that Shapp. is very
much concerned," he said. “He
really impressed me.”

“I’d like to change my shift on
a weekday and spend a few
hours in the housing offices
listening to ideas and criticize
from the RA’s (Fesident assist-

Waters’ only complaint about
Pitt is that “the campus organi-
zations and departments all seem
to be so critical of each other

and they criticize wittfout being

constructive about it.”

He also cited the racial con-
ditions he’s_ observed in the
dorms and said, “I guess that a
certain amount of polarization
is necessary, but I hope it’s just
a spell.” Waters, a black who's
lived in Pittsburgh all his life,
feels that “in the last two years
Pitt’s taken great steps in improv-
ing conditions for blacks."

Waters especially enjoys mak-
ing friends with students and
tags his role on the campus se-
curity force as “gratifying. I
guess I just enjoy helping others,”
he smiled. ~

A contradictory interpretation of the charges
was offered by General Counsel of the SACB.
Bernad J. Walters, who denied that the hearings
were going to “put anyone in jail or fine them.
We would like to officially determine," he con-
tinued,” what type of organization is soliciting the
funds of the public.”

The YWLL viewpoint, given after the testimony
described the Board and its hearings as a “throw-
“back to the days of McCarthyism. There is no
cross examination, no due process of law, all it
does is display distorted testimony for the‘ sake
of exposure.’

No present YWLL members were-subpoenaed
by the Board for testimony.

The originally planned two days of SACB
hearings at the Federal Building were cut short
to one, approximately two hour session, on Thurs-
day, due to a “scarcity of evidence.”

Prof and Poet

by CINDY MORGAN
Assistant Entertainment Editor

Donald Petesch. an English
professor in his second year at
Pitt. read several selections of
his poetry to a small audience in
the Book Stores Fine Arts Room
Thursday afternoon.

Presently. Petesch is working
on a cycle of poems about his
childhood, which he hopes to have
completed by late spring. He then
wishes to have them published.

“A book should be the person,”
he mused, “and I think I will come
out as a person."

Petesch has been working on
poetry off and on since he was ten
years old, and he wrote a whole
book imitating Ogden Nash while
in the army. But it was last term
that he decided to seriously begin
writing poetry.

Some of the poems he recited
included. “For a Katydid on the
Sixth Floor of a 42—story Build-
ing." “Three Visions of Dirty Old
Men." “Petesch Is." and "The
End of California." As a speaker.
he is Very pleasant to listen to: his

voice is low and mellow and rises I

and falls smoothly with the meter
of his poetry.

Poetry does not take up all his
writing time. however. Currently.
LS1‘: press is considering publish-
ing his book on William Faulkner.
Another book on Richard Wright.

author of Black Boy, is currently
in the works.

He has also found himself in-
volved in bringing various poets
to Pitt‘s campus, along with the
Pitt Press and the English De-
partment. These have included

“I got a robe. You got a robe.
_All God’s chilen got a robe.“

He squatted on the curb. un-
_;mindful of the small pieces of
glass from broken wine and whis-
, .ey bottles under his bottom and
with tightly closed eyes, began to
sing the old hymnal louder.

He took the cap off the bottle of
,.Old Grand Dad lying in his lap
held securely by his legs, and ab-
7sentmindedly tossed it into the se-
‘wer.

, He seemed to listen for the
-bplash as it hit the water and when
he heard it do so, a peculiar smile
came over his face as though the
splashing had assured him o
“ gme-profound meaning. '
No one on the avenue knows
hen the old men sleep. It seems
they are always there—no mat-
ter what time of day or night.
They are barely noticeable. Most
people pass them by without a
second glance; as. though sitting
on their old milk creates in front
set the long deserted store fronts;
playing checkers, chewing tobac-
yco or- reminiscing over their
“young buck days."

and they will look right back but
they won’t see you. They‘1l_smile

.They are only checker games,
young bucks calling them useless
canes, old water-ruined crumpled
§felt hats at least 20 years old-
snapshots of the grand kids, and
stories of the past, which always
start out, “When I was” ‘or “I re-
member when.”

 The pension or relief checks are
no longer important. Memories
cost nothing.

To live in this country and be
poor is trial.

‘ To live in this country and be
poor and black or in ‘a minority is
‘an even greater trial.

0 Rent Withholding: Legal Protection

Something can be done about
sub-standard housing in Pitts-
burgh and the University com-
munity. Rentwithholding is now
a reality which may greatly im-
prove housing conditions. es-
pecially for students
off-campus housing.

Rent withholding is a program
to improve Pittsburgh's housing
by allowing tenants an sub-stan-

dard housing to pay their rentto a_

bank instead of their landlord when‘

their landlord ,
violates t h e
Housing Code. If 
violations are
not corrected in

a short time‘I"the "~.,;‘§..4V
owner will be

prosecuted. In six months. if vio-
lations are still not corrected. the
tenant may have his rent returned
to him.

Rent withholding starts with a
home inspection as a result of a
complaint or a normal inspec-
tion by the Health Department.
If you feel your home is not
safe or in good repair and that
you are eligible for rent with-
holding. you may have your home
inspected by calling either of
these numbers: 355-4030 or 391-
2930. I

do.

This is the charge that the SACB
entered last ,Thursday and Friday in

of the SACB gave a contradictory slant

An inspector from the Alle-
gheny County Health Department

will come by your home as soon ‘

as possible. As soon as the inspec-
tor finishes examining your home
for code violations, he will tell
you if your home is qualified
for rent withholding and what
action should be taken. You are

’ then eligible to enter the pro-

gram. If you choose the rent
withholding program, you will
pick up your .I.D. card at the
Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment, Room 649, City-County
Building. _

Your landlord will be notified
that your home has been certified
for rent witholding and that
legal action will be taken if re-
pairs are not made. When your
next rent payment is due. pay
into the special account which
has been set up for this purpose
at Mellon Bank instead of paying
your landlord directly. At the
time of making your payment.
you must present your I.D.
card.

The rent withholding law pro-
tects you for six’ months after
your house is certified for rent
withholding if your rent pay-
ments are maintained. Remem-
ber. you lose this protection if

you do not pay your rent to the

‘bank.

Should you have any problems
with your landlord after enter-
ing the rent withholding program
(such as ejection, raise in the
rent, shutting off of the gas,

light or water) you should call .

your lawyer or the Neighborhood
Legal Service at 261-1662. '

Other outlets would be the
Lawyer Referral Service at
261-0518 and the Off-Campus
Housing Committee at Pitt at
x7330.

Rent withholding is a six
month program. If the landlord
makes the necessary repairs to
your home within that period
there is another inspection.
You will be notified if the re-
pairs meet the Building Codes.
If they do, the rent money that
you paid to the bank will be
returned to the landlord.

If the landlord does not make

the necessary repairs at the end ‘

of six months, the rent money
is returned to you by the Alle-
gheny County Health Depart-
ment. Should you -be dissatis-
fied with the decision given. you
have the right to appeal to the
Director of the Allegheny County
Health Department. A

'After being inactive for several
years and on the brink of repeal, SACB
was invigorated due to legislation pass-
_ed by the Senate'of 1968.

_i Allegedly, as a result of a deal be-
tween Everett Dirksen and Lyndon
Johnson, the Board was given a larger
operation budget, from $405,000. to
$450,000 per year, and was allowed to

but a yearly budget of $450000 for the
needless travel and operating expendi-

Why is it that the public charges of
the SACB differ? Can‘t a supposed

sidered by that government to be "es-
sential to the protection of the nation-

don’t care, the SACB will continue

Looking at the nature of the case.
there is no legal basis for the trials

taken around the country to prove that
the Young Workers Liberation League
(YWIL) and the Center for Marxist Edu-
cation are “communist front organizations
’ operated to give aid to a communist

And then. one day. perhaps all dis-
senters will be subject to harassment,
if not imprisonment. and the people.
not the government will be held re-
sponsible. '

YWLL and the Center for Marxist Edu-
cation are a self-admitted Marxist-Len-'
inist groups that publicly admit ideo-
logical ties with the Communist Party.

0tfioe llnnecessary

Editor. The Pitt News:

Is is my firm belief that Vice-
Chancellor’s Kobosky‘s recent ac-
tion to regard to Dr. Charles
Montgomery was essential at this
time, in order to insure efficient
operation of Student Develop-
ment offices and programs. It has
been very clear during the last
several months, that with respect
both to the man and the position,
such a change was necessary.

I fail to understand why Gorm—

"l~:“i-ey (“The Student Development

Office Should Not Be Abolished.”
Pitt News, Feb. 24) does not
realize that transitionary stages
in the organization of programs
may dictate one structure, while
later development and change ne-
cessitates that a redefinition of
previous structural models must
be made.

It appears to me that, rather
than making an “about-face,” Mr.
Kobosky reexamined the struc-
ture of the Office of Student De-
velopment at this time, seven
months after its inception, and
found that the model which he had

- conceived last spring was not op-
‘erationally sound and therefore

ecided to reorganize somewhat
in view of the information gained
since last August.

With regard to the recommend-
ation that the position of Dean of
Student Development be main-
tained because “students can
profit from having one more per-
son to facilitate and coordinate."
I would venture to say that this
logic is not only absurd. but re-
flects a distinct lack of aware-

yiness of university structure and

In the Student Development
area. directors act in an autono-
mous. decision-making capacity.
and .are responsible only to the
Vice-Chancellor.

 

The maintainance of an amor-
phous administrative position at
an intermediate level between the
directors and the Vice—Chancellor
only serves to insure that the dis-
tance between students and the
top—level administration of the
Student Affairs area is increased.
with the result that, in typical u-ni-

‘versity fashion, students can be

caught up in enough administra-
tive red-tape to diminish their
chances of influencing high-level
policy decisions.

It seems to me that it would be
much more appropriate to employ
the funds which would have gone
to maintain the office of a Dean of
Student Development at lower
classification levels in such areas
as counseling and placement,
which operate directly for the
benefit of students and where
there is a critical need for more
staff positions.

It is not at all clear to me why
Gormley is arguing for the contin-
uation of the Office of Dean of
Student Development since I see

have you surrendered your bodies

is to begin to think. Think of the
horror of pioneer imperialism:

crushed by an oppressor lusting

think of how you are helping to

Banner was quite pleased with
his team‘s performance.

Banner remarked. “I believe
we performed better this year
than we did in 1970 at Delaware.
The entire team did very well un-
der pressure. I am especially
proud of the distance medley
quartet. A world record is some-
thing one always strives to
achieve. This is the first world
record held by a Pitt track squad
since the 1930‘s, as far as I know.

“Each and every Pitt competi-
tor gave all he had. Ted Bobby ran
into some bad luck in the 660. He
was bumped coming out of the turn
and fell to the track. Unfortunate-
ly, this bad break will prevent him

from entering the IC4A’s in this
particular event.”

When asked if the Delaware’ In-
vitational was an indication of the
kind of performance Pitt is cap-
able of making at the forthcom-
ing IC4A's. Banner cautioned.
“It‘s very hard to say at the mo-
ment. At Princeton (the IC4A's).

there will be a lot more competi— '

tion than there was at Delaware.
In addition. because of the trials.
our relay teams probably will not
be as fresh as they would liken

“Also. several relay quartet
runners will be participating in
individualievents. Finally. we just
don't know if we‘ll escape the in-
jury bug. In this regard. right
now. the only doubtful competitor
is Bryant Salter in the high jump.“

Dave Wylie and John Chatman were the only two matmen to 5‘

break into the scoring column Wylie won a 6-0 decision over Bob
Medina and Chatman managed a 4-4 draw with Don Stone.

Chatman came down a weight
class and was not in top condi-
tion. Adams explained that he
wanted Chatman to have one
more victory under his belt be-
fore the tournaments. Rather
than pit the freshman wrestler
against State’s star Clyde Frantz.
Adams brought him down eight

pounds to a less challenging '
opponent. .
Though Adams expressed a

little optimism prior to the
match, he did not expect the
match to be so one-sided.

“We expected to win at 118
and 150. I thought 126 would be
a toss-up. but that guy just maul-

Best Perforrmmce Of Season

The Pitt Gymnastic‘ team

only to come back from the
New York town with a loss to
a record-setting Syracuse per-
formance.

After being the victim of
some lopsided scores themselves
(a 1314-1248 debacle against
I.U.P. and a 1301-1245 drubbing.
by Duquesne) the shooters vic-
timized Geneva by 91 points.

scoring his personal high of 9.4
points in the free exercise for
the second week in a row.

He also captured Pitt‘s only
first in the meet.

Pitt travels to Penn State to-
night for a tri-meet with PSU
and West Virginia.

Syracuses 143.3 points Satur-
day was their highest team total
of the season and Pitt‘s respec-
table 131.25 wasn‘t enough to
catch them. a

Pitt could manage only three

, seconds and a third due to Syra-

cuse‘s performance.
Sophomore Dick Pribis won

-second place in the free exer-

cise as did senior "Mike Beatty
on the Side horse for Pitt.

Frank Swift captured the
other second place finish on the
still rings behind George Stal-
ter of Syracuse.

Stalter‘s score of 9.55 was his
personal high of the season and
placed him at the top of the
East on that event.

in the free exercise for the East-
ern competition.

Pitt Coach Warren Neiger
stated. “the team other than
Meek didn't.hit. Everyone was
off of their routines.“

Dave Andrews was the first
to really miss. His Arabian
sumersault was poorly executed
resulting in a botched-up corner
turnaround. His 7.35 score was
more than a point below his
season average.

Phil Lilly, while warming up
in anticipation of going all-
around, sprained his forearm
which reduced his strength and
mobility. His 7.05 score on the
below last
week’s 8.40 routine.

Dick Pribis twisted his head
too much during a pirouette on
the parallel bars and fell off.
His 5.1 score was below last
week‘s7:60.

But even if every Pitt per-
former had hit his routine. the
record breaking score of Syra--
cuse “would have been enough,
to_ top Pitt on their previous
best day. “ "‘ "

Adams hotly contested the de

cision which gave Stone his tying: 6

points against Chatman. Stone
was credited with a take down
which the coach felt he should-
n’t have been.

“It was a case of misinterpre-
tation,” stated Adams. “The ref
was very good. They’re bound to
make one mistake per match,
and this one just happened to
hurt us.”

After losing so many men to
injuries, Adams looks toward
the Eastern tournaments and‘
says. “I can't be realistic and
say well do well as a team. We
have some individuals who can
do well. but to hope for a
team success would be unre-
alistic.“

The match also changed
Adams‘ opinion of Penn States
chances in the tournaments.

“I think Navy will win with
what I’ve seen today,” he said.
“Navy is in superior condition.
They had some guys that should
have really mauled some of our
men and didn’t. It’ll be a real
close match though.”

The Penn Stateimatch endedff

Pitts dual meet schedule. The
Panthers have maintained a
record of 8-3-1. despite a over-
whelming number of mishaps
and injuries.

Adams looks back on the sea-
son and comments. "With all
that has happened we should be
happy and thankful that things-
worked out as well as they have
and just count our blessings.“

When the swimmers traveled
to Kent State Saturday for their
last dual meet of the season,
they had little hope for a vic-
tory. However, they finished by
adding a win to their record.
No, the mermen didn't defeat
Kent State, they beat Akron,
and it wasn’t in a dual meet;
it was in a double dual meet.

“It seems that Coach (Bill)
Grant who resigned three weeks
ago) had arranged the meet early
in the season,” explained acting
Coach Dick Bradshaw. “How-
ever, the plans never showed up
 print, and so when we got

men

there we had to decide whether
to swim Akron or not."

Fortunately the Panthers did.
They splashed Akron 75-38
without any extra effort. (In a
double dual meet three squads
swim in the same events at the
same time but place different-
ly in regard to the team they are
being scored against.)

The only events Pitt lost to
Akron were the one-meter diving
and the breaststroke. Dave Wes-
sel, who usually takes the diving
for the Panthers, was unable to
make the trip in order to pre-
pare for dental school exams.

To make matters worse, Carl
Morris received two personal
fouls within the span of five
seconds and ‘fouled out with
15 minutes left. Kunze tied

the score at 40 with the result-

ing foul shot.

“It was a shame that he -fouled
out so quickly because we had
somebody ready to go in to
replace him,” Ridl mentioned.
“Losing him really hurt us be-

qfsause he gave us a nice lift
in the first half.”

Morris had all of his 11 points
in the first half, includ_ing a last
second tip-in of a shot by Kent
Scott.

After Morris fouled out, the
two teams traded baskets as
there were seven tie scores in
the next eight minutes. The lead
changed’ hands several times be-
fore the Lions pulled away.

Crist did an excellent defen-
sive job on Harrison by keeping
him from driving to the basket.

Ridl realizes what the loss
means to the Panthers chances
for the NIT bid. “We knew that
we had to win all of the last
three games to have a. chance,
and we’re all a little disappoint-
ed,” he said.

 

However, freshman Martin
Staley took first in three-meter
and Ron Ludwig placed third.

In freestyle swimming, Rickie
Rowe won the 200 and 500; Tom
Hayes took the 50, and Fred
Lewis and Mark Cohen placed
first in the 1,000 and 100 respect-
ively.

Jim Harnish, who swam
freestyle in high school, won the
Individual Medley for the first
time this season.

Pitt’s Jack Veitch took the
backstroke event and Dave An-
derson won the 200 butterfly.

In regard to the scoring
against the undefeated Kent
State, the situation was reversed.
Pitt lost 79-34, taking only three
events.

The Golden Flashes Alan
Smith had the same time as
Rowe in the 200, but the judges
gave the event to Pitt. Rickie
out-touched Smith. Rowe took
the 500 by half a pool length.
And Hayes placed first in 50-
free with, as Bradshaw put it,
“one of his better times.”

Bradshaw "remarked that the

team will now be tapering to-
wards Easterns. The dual meet
