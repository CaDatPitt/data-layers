A motion passed at Tuesday’s
Faculty Assembly meeting promises to
give Pitt faculty and staff a choice con-
cerning the health care coverage they
receive. _

In a unanimous vote, Assembly
members enacted a motion made by

Hershey that will offer both indemnity
and managed care coverage as options
to Pitt employees.

Pitt’s current contract with Blue
Cross will end- after next year.
According to Gordon MacLeod, profes-
sor of health services administration at
the Graduate School of Public Health,
Pitt does have options if its ties with
Blue Cross end.

“We have U.S. Healthcare, Aetna,’

and some out—of-town vendors as
options,” said MacLeod. “Some faculty
and. staff were angered, though, when
we eliminated Health America as an
option.”

According to James Holland, chair-
man of the Benefits and Welfare
Committee of the assembly, the current
plan, the University Health Network,
will disappear at the end of 1997.

“Blue Cross is losing money on

their agreement with Pitt,” said Holland.
“They may be on_ the verge of eliminat-
ing the comprehensive plan.”

Armual increases in the percentage
of premium caps are the reason many
faculty feel Blue Cross is trying to
reduce or eliminate its participation in
the comprehensive deductible, accord-
ing to MacLeod.

In addition to raising premiums,
MacLeod also noted that Blue Cross
eliminated the traditional coverage,
though it was the least’ expensive to
maintain.

MacLeod, who was the founding
director of the national HMO program,
said one of the major problems com-
pounding the issue has been failed com-

 

munication between the administration
and the Beneﬁts and Welfare commit-
tee. ‘
“UPMCS is the "corporate system
for providing health care [to Pitt
employees] through numbers of hospi-
tals and providers,” said MacLeod. “It
has an HMO, but it is primarily for
Medicaid.”

Hershey’s motion is not only con-
sidered good by the Assembly, but by
the law as well. As one assembly mem-

ber said, according to section 1310 of

the HMO Act, any company with more

than 25 employees must provide more

than one health care option for its
employees.

Faculty and staff of Pitt’s satellite
campuses are having an even harder

‘time working with the current health

care program.

“This is a problem because all the
comprehensive plan’s doctors are here,
two hours away,” said one Pitt

Johnstown faculty member in atten-

dance at the meeting.

MacLeod agreed that the satellite
campuses’ situation remains a problem,
but said Blue Cross is aware of it.

“Blue Cross is aware and planning
an alternative to satisfy the needs of the
satellite campuses’ faculty and staff,”
said MacLeod.

Another Brentwood officer faces trial in Gammage case

Thursday, November 7, I996

Rarnesh c. Reddy

 

The trial of
Brentwood Officer John
Vojtas, charged with

involuntary manslaughter
in the death of Jonny
Gammage, began on
Monday.

Anthony J. Krastek,
the deputy district attor-
ney in this case, informed
the jury that Gammage
was forced to the ground.
With a knee on his back,
his diaphragm was not
able to work. He was not
able to get his lungs mov-
ing and died due to suffo-
cation, said Krastek.

“We are not saying
that John Vojtas and the
officers conspired to kill
Jonny Gammage. Or
intentionally killed him,”
Krastek said.

But Krastek wanted
the jury to consider the
question of whether Vojtas
acted in a reckless and
grossly negli.gent manner.

Alexander H. Lindsay,
Vojtas’ defense attorney,
informed the jury that
what Vojtas did had noth-
ing to do with the death of
Gammage because Vojtas
did exactly what police
officers are trained to do.

Lindsay brought up an
alternative to homicide
for the death of
Gammage.

.“There is a condition
known as Adrenal Rush
where people literally get
scared to death because
.fibers of [the] heart sensi-
tive to electrical impulses
cause the heart to quiver,
causing death,” said
Lindsay.‘

This should be classi-

fied as an accident and not
a homicide based on the

Delivered

complaints to administrators

Jaime Leach

   

With the temptation of choco-
late and lollipops, the Division of~
Student Affairs lured curious stu-
dents to their information table in
the William Pitt Union.

Yesterday was the first day for
the table, staffed by Gary Houston,
executive assistant vice chancellor,
and Geoffrey Wood, director of the
Office of International Services.

The preliminary day was a
chance for student affairs to find
out what students know about the
services offered by the department,
and to answer the question, “What
exactly is student affairs?”

“It’s a student service program
that provides programming for most
areas of student life,” said Robert
Gallagher, interim vice chancellor
for student affairs.

The purpose of the open forum
was, according to Houston, “to try
to prompt questions in the back of
people’s minds. This [table] is try-
ing to bring those questions out.”

While some students passed by
the table, eyeing it with curious
glances, other students stopped to
find out what was going on.

Freshman Alison Nickum asked
about the Japanese language pro-
gram here at Pitt. She wanted to
findout where to take her sugges-
tions for improving the program.
Wood and Houston recommended
she take her issue to her academic
advisor or the chair of the depart-
ment.

Mark Czaskowski, another stu-
dent, posed several questions con-
cerning immunizations and student
health. The questions involved
choices students have in immuniza-
tions and what agency administers
the immunizations. _

For questions that can’t be
answered immediately, the staff
will contact a source who can, and
gets back to the student.

A popular topic raised was the
opportunities for transfer students
once they arrived at Pitt. Several
students commented that there
should be an orientation for trans-
fers, similar to the program for

incoming freshmen. Another trans—.

for student inquired about the ser-
vices offered to help incoming
transfers.

According to Wood, these ques-
tions are important because “issues
are being raised.”

Comments were also given con-
cerning the need for more police
patrol on Forbes Avenue during
weekends as well as requests made
for tutoring in courses such as
macro—cconomics.

For the time being there is no
decision as to whether the table
should be theme oriented or rather
an open table where students would
be able to comment on a wide vari-
ety of topics.

Wood said a theme may not be
necessary because students would
seek specific information out on
their own if they know the services
offered. ‘

Wrap-up
his concession speech when there were
still three hours left to vote on the West
Coast. After the commercial break, they
announced the mistake, blaming it on
live television. .

Voter turnout was a key issue in this
election. All 50 states had at least 2 per-
cent fewer voters than in the last presi-
dential election. Several states reported
at least 15 percent lower turnout than
last time, according to the AP.

cy, Republicans do havc something to

time since the 1930s. Republicans won
225 House seats and the Democrats won
203, House seats with the AP still unsure
about six of the races. One independent
was victorious in this House election.
The AP reports that the Republicans
will retain a majority in the Senate as
well. One Oregon Senate race ended in
a virtual tie, with Republican Gordon
Smith leading by only 2 percent and a
few more days will be necessary to
count the absentee ballots to determine
the winner. Assuming Smith holds on to
win, the Republicans will have 55 sena-
tors compared to the Democrats’ 45.

Greeks sponsor Derby Days
festival to help injured student

Karen Urbanik

 

Girls chasing men and stealing
their hats would normally be consid-
ered rude, but these girls are earning
points in the Greek-sponsored Derby
Days, an event held to raise money for
Kevin Cecil.

Derby Days is a week-long
fundraising celebration sponsored by
the brothers of Sigma Chi and involv-
ing all 12 sororities in the quest to
raise money for Kevin Cecil.

“This is about his fellow class-
mates doing something on their own,
using all their resources,” said Rob
Guigley, chair of the Derby Days’
events.

Events kick off with Sig-N—Dales.
“We get girls to come [to the event]
for a five-dollar cover,” explained
Guigley. “We choreograph a dance
and strip. We try to make it as fun as
possible.”

On Sunday, sisters gathered on the
Cathedral lawn for “Fun ‘N Games.”
They battled for points in the egg toss,
tug of war, and “Chase the Brother
with the Derby.” Points are awarded
to winners and amassed over the

week.

“This hits close to home,” said
Brittan Forsythe, Delta Delta Delta
president and house Derby Darling.
“We have always participated in this.
We work hard and have a little fun for
such a great person and a great
cause?’

On Tuesday night, there was a
social in Peter’s Pub from which the
cover charge was donated to the
cause. Wednesday began the search
for the Golden Derby. Clues to find it
are found in the classified section of
The Pitt News .

“It’s a great way to help some-
one,” said Amanda Bobyak, Delta Phi
Epsilon president. “It’s sororities
working together for one great cause
instead of against each other.”

Tonight, there is a benefit concert
at The Attic featuring The Dirges at
9:30 p.m. The cover charge and some
of the proceeds of drinks will go to
Kevin Cecil.

Activities will end on Friday,
when the derby will be found. The
sorority winner will be announced.
On Monday, they will present Kevin
Cecil with a check for the monetary

LIMA, Peru —— The Peruvian
Transportation Ministry admitted on
Tuesday that adhesive tape found cov-
ering sensor ports on the jetliner’s fuse-
lage may have caused the plane to
crash, killing all 70 people on board.
The AeroPeru jet crashed into the
Pacific Ocean shortly after takeoff.
The Transportation Ministry
said an important piece of wreckage
showed three ports which monitor air
pressure and help track altitude and air
speed had been covered with adhesive
tape. Their excuse was that the tape had
probably not been removed when the
plane was polished. Associated Press

REYKJAVIK, Iceland — Flood
waters caused by volcanic eruptions
under Europe’s largest glacier,
Vatnajokull, destroyed two major
bridges in Iceland. Civil .defense
authorities were concerned the mass
ﬂooding would sweep a third major
bridge away, but so far the third bridge
still stands.

The ﬂooding occurred in a
remote area where no homes or people
were threatened. The_Loki volcano
began erupting on Oct. 1 and was
responsible for melting 70,000 cubic

feet of water. Associated Press

CYBERSPACE — The Web may have
come to a slow crawl, but it didn’t crash
as predicted on Tuesday when tens of
millions of people logged on to get their
election news. Between 9 and 10 p.m.
EST, CNN’s site was peaking at more
than 5 million hits per hour. By the end
of Tuesday evening, the site had 50 ml-
lion hits, almost tripling the last record.
“The record for CNN on the
main site on a single day had been 18
million hits, on the day of the Iraqi
bombing,” said executive producer
Mike Riley. The intemet functioned
exactly as it was intended to. It made
sure every piece of information got
where it was going, although at slower
than normal speeds. Associated Press

in the right state of mind,” said
Dmettri Gammage, the sister of
Jonny Gammage.

Narves Gammage, Jonny’s
mother, said nothing had changed
from the last trial of officers which
ended in a mistrial.

“What I have seen today was
just a continuation from the mistri-
al, different stories again, different
tactics,” said Narves Gammage.
“They were there, so all five
should be charged.  That’s the
way, I feel about it.”

On Tuesday, Ray Seals testified
and told the jury he never knew
Gammage to use ,marijuana. The
testimony was given to address the

 

fact that marijuana was found in
the Jaguar Gammag'e drove.

Tow—truck driver Frank Belajac
testified he saw a fight between the
officers and Gammage, discredit-
ing the testimony he had given pre-
viously when said he did not see a
fight.

A law student from Duquesne
University, Timothy Burns testified
that he was driving on Route 5]
and saw a lot of confusion. A few
days later, he realized he had wit-
nessed the Gammage incident after
watching the news. He first con-
tacted the NAACP and the ACLU
before contacting the Federal
Bureau of Investigation about what

he had witnessed.

The court adjourned Tuesday
night with the testimony of a foren-
sic pathologist, Dr. Abdulrezak
Shakir, who testified and said,
“The actions of those officers con-
tributed to the restriction of Jonny
Gammage and finally to his death.”

On Wednesday, as court
resumed, Shakir testified that an
adrenal rush would not have
stopped Gammage’s heart, but
agreed that adrenal rush could have
contributed to Gammage’s death.

Dr. Cyril Wecht took the stand’

later and agreed that the cops’
actions could have contributed to
the death of Gammage.

amount their efforts produced.

This year, Sigma Chi was unable to
get corporate sponsorship as they had in
latter years because they are not donat-
ing to a non—profit organization. Since
Kevin Cecil is a Pitt student, donations
would not be tax deductible. They are
hoping to earn $12,000 for Kevin. This
makes their job twice as hard, but they
are still full of enthusiasm.

Derby Darlings is a great way for
independents to take part in this event,
according to Burnes.

“Each sorority chooses a liaison,’’
explains R.J. Burnes, president of Sigma
Chi. “Their picture is put on a can and
people put money in the can with the girl
of their choice. The can with the most
money wins points for the overall Derby
Days competition.”

Since Cecil will not be in town on
Monday when the check will be ready,
Burnes and Guigley presented him with
a Penguins jersey, autographed by Mario
Lemieux on Monday evening.

Guigley and his co—chair Eric Heintz
were able to coordinate their efforts with
the Cecil family with the help of Betsy
Sallade-Farina, director of Food
Services.

Cecil and his family are grateful that
Pitt students are still concerned with his
well-being.

“We are certainly happy you select—
ed Kevin,” Mrs. Cecil said to Burnes
and Guigley, “even though he wasn’t in
a fraternity.”

Kevin expressed his desire to con-
tinue his education at Pitt. “I took a class
this summer,” Cecil said. “We’re look-
ing at starting again in the fall. I want to

. take more classes, but I won’t be able to

finish in Engineering. I will have to go
into Computer Science or something.”

Cecil keeps in touch with his friends
at Pitt via voice-activated computer. He
says he is very appreciative of every-
thing students at the University have
done to help him.

“He’s our age,” Burnes said. “We’re
not doing this for money or because it’s
a good thing to do. We are doing it to
give Kevin hope.”

Day to clay college stress can cause depression

NChad Simon

   

Each year 17 million Americans are
plagued by depression. Within this large
number, more and more college-aged
people are being diagnosed with this
mental disorder.

But nearly half of those who need
help never seek it, according to United
Mental Health, Inc.

One example of this is Jake, a 19-
year-old college student, who had the
normal stresses in life like fatigue,
occasional sadness, and the inability to
concentrate for long periods of time
during class.

Because he missed his girlfriend,
Jake found that his stresses which
seemed normal before, had worsened.

“I simply could not function nor-
mally in everyday life,” he said. He said
he couldn’t focus on his school work
and he slept at every opportunity he
could in order to escape his sorrows. He
even withdrew from social activities.

“I would come home from class and
sit in my room all alone and stare off
into space,” he said. “Besides class, the
only time I left my room was to eat.”

Jake was so distraught, he decided
to seek professional help in order to
claw his way out of the lifeless hole he
had dug for himself. “My depres-
sion was just getting worse,” he said. “It
was really scary because I had never
felt that down before, and I didn’t think
that I would ever live a normal life
again. I was so depressed that I pulled
myself out of college to come home and
get treatment.” '

Nearly 80 percent of those who do
receive help for depression are success-
fully treated, according to United
Mental Health, Inc.

Some symptoms of clinical depres-
sion may include:

-Persistent feelings of sadness or irri-
tability

Changes in sleep and appetite

-Loss of interest in social activities
-Trouble concentrating, fatigue, loss of
self-esteem ~
-Thoughts of suicide.

A pamphlet on depression states
that causes of depression may be both
chemical or social. In chemical depres-
sion, there is an imbalance of chemicals
in the brain which could lead to depres-
sion.

On the other hand, drastic changes
in one’s life may trigger depression,
including the death or simply a loss of a
loved one.

Fatal illness may lead to mental ill-
ness as well, according to the brochure.
The excessive use of alcohol and drugs
can worsen already existing symptoms
of depression.

According to Dr. Roger Haskett, a
psychiatrist, an extreme amount of
stress is a common cause of depression

among college students.

He said it can be devastating for an
individual to go away from home for
the first time and live on his own in a
new environment.

“Sometimes it is difﬁcult for an
individual to make new friendships. It
can also be hard to adjust to a new
schedule. There is an increased work
demand which may lead to the loss of
sleep,” said Haskett.

These are all contributing factors of
depression among college students.
Haskett said people in their 20s are at a
higher risk of being diagnosed with
depression.

However, depression can be treated
with medication and psychotherapy.

“Cognitive behavioral problem
solving can be as effective as medica-
tion. Unfortunately, depression is very
serious and 10-15 percent of those diag-
nosed will commit suicide,” said
Haskett.

People who commit suicide often
have no one to turn to, he said.

“Therefore the individual has no
one to force him to grasp reality and see
that things are not as bad as they may
seem. As a result, they may take their
own lives,” Haskett said.

If you feel you may be suffering
from depression call the United Mental
Health clinic 391-3820 or the depres-
sion hotline at 1-888-805-1000 to
receive a screening.

THEFT OF MEDICAL
EXAM FOILEII IN $.F.

17—year~old With Nonfunctioning
Can Beaten by Students

By H. K. Lee and (1. Bowman,
Chronicle Staff Writers

A young masked gunman burst into
a room full of students taking a medical
exam Saturday in San Francisco and
demanded. a copy of a test section but
was thwarted when several outraged
proctors and would—be doctors punched
him out, police said yesterday. ‘

Police said the youth grabbed a green
folder at the from: of the room,
disappeared into a bathroom and then
rocmtzrged. cursing. He then confronted
a proctor, demanding the Physical
Sciences portion of the test. A s the
proctor fumbled for the test section, the
youth may have been careless with his
gun-ethe proctor grabbed it, and
suddenly the intruder found himself at
gunpoint.

The youth then apparently smacked
the proctor in the face. Enraged, at least
ﬁve proctors and test-takers surrounded
the suspect and threw punches at him,
drawing blood, witnesses said...

Pointsare best made by reason, not theft!

Freedom of the press and
freedom of speech were consid-
ered so important by our founding
fathers, they were guaranteed in
the First Amendment to the
Constitution. There is a reason
that this amendment was first.

Apparently this fact was lost
on students at the University of
California at Berkeley. The Daily
Californian, the campus paper,
saw 4,000 of its papers stolen on
Monday, the day it ran its election
endorsements. Almost all of its
23,000 papers were also stolen on
Tuesday, according to AP wire
reports.

An unidentiﬁed caller, in a

 

message, gave this as a reason:
the paper had endorsed
Proposition 209, a California bill
to end racial preferences in public
hiring, education, and contracts.

The thieves apparently fol-
lowed the delivery trucks and
made off with all the papers after
the drivers left. The staff of the
paper printed and distributed
5,000 additional copies on cam-
pus after the first batch was
stolen.

In this society, and especially
in a university setting, freedom of

expression should be protected
and exercised. Stealing these
papers because the position was
unacceptable to some of the cam-
pus community is fascistic.

The best way to deal with a
conﬂict like this is to show, by use
of reason and evidence, that the
paper’s position is wrong. Any
op-ed page worth the paper it’s
printed on will allow ample
opportunity for all sides of a story
to be fairly represented through
columnists and letters.

Resorting to this Nazi method

of snatching ideas away before
the dawn is exactly counter to
what opponents of proposition
209 seem to want. The unidenti-
fied caller who left the message
on the answering machine at the
paper’s offices said that their
endorsement of Proposition 209 is
what caused the thefts, according
to The Daily Californian. He went
on to say “Don’t even try to bring
that white—boy network around
here, motherf**ker.” '

Clearlythese are not the men-
tal giants of the campus.

If they want to prove their
point, let the opponents print their
views and prove the paper wrong.

Eoh Dole 3°+  Bins.

Democrats,

  

Republicans make you pay
for beer, the Democrats give it to
you for free. Which just goes to
show that the best party is
Democratic.

That’s what this reporter
learned, when I went to three
campaign parties on election
night. The Democrats had better
food and beer including the fact
that it was free. At the Republican
party, the $3.75 for a Budweiser
was a little expensive.

Out of all three, Mina Baker
Knoll had the best food, Bill
Coyne had the most laid—back
party, and Mike Fisher’s was a
roomful of stuffed—suits with
nothing to do. -

We arrived at Fisher’s party to
ﬁnd that the state ﬂag was hung
on the wall backwards. It was an
omen that the celebration was
going to be the most god—awful
party I’ve ever been to in my life.

Fisher had his party in down-
town Pittsburgh at the Double
Tree Hotel ballroom. The ball-
room was decorated with red,
white and blue balloons, and a
woman was handing out cam-
paign stickers. She kept trying to
stab a sticker onto me every time I
walked past her. It was like walk-
ing by the perfume counter and
trying to dodge the spray.

He had a fancy buffet set up,
but you can get a better meal at
Eddie’s (well maybe not better,
but it was cafeteria food made to
look nicer). Swedish meatballs,
chicken ﬁngers, ravioli, and some
type of really scary fajita were just
a few of the non-delectables they
had available. I felt like I was
perusing the lines in the Towers’

  

cafeteria.

There was a lot of press there
but not many revelers. The people
who were there were dressed very
conservatively, and it didn’t look

like they were having much fun.

Perhaps the nasty food and over-
priced beer ruined their party
mood. I

At around 9 p.m., a man
asked everyone who was eating to
go into the main ballroom. He
said to get into the room because
cameras were rolling. That way
when the television stations start-
ed broadcasting it would look like
there were more people there.

Well, that party wasn’t exact-
ly “hopping,” so we went to the
Harp and Fiddle in the Strip
District for Congressman Coyne’s
party. Coyne was the Democratic
candidate for the 14th District in
the U.S. House of
Representatives.

What an improvement. The
atmosphere was at the other end
of the spectrum compared to
Fisher’s. There were people drink-
ing, watching the results come in
on television, and having a great
time. People were stopping me
to give out stickers for Coyne.
There were balloons hung up and
signs on the walls.

The food was laid out in a
plain buffet. There was a huge
submarine sandwich sliced up
along with wings, stuffed ravioli,
and veggies.

I was glad to leave the ball-
room and enter the old time neigh-
borhood drinkery atmosphere.

People were dressed in very
casual ﬂarmels, khakis, jeans, and
sweaters, ‘with a mix of suits
throughout the room.

.We moved on to Knoll’s
party, at the Engineers Club

not blondes, have more fun

downtown. This place was upper
echelon atmosphere. When we
walked in, there was an old bank
vault with tables and chairs inside
of it.

Upstairs, where the party
was, there was a polka band play-
ing. It was smaller than Fisher’s,
but the suits were not nearly as
uptight. (This could be because it
was two hours and much booze
later.) It was a mixed crowd of
young and old.

The spread of food was beau-
tiful (not cafeteria—like at all):
bread bowls filled with spinach
dip, stuffed mushrooms, crois-
sants with Swiss cheese and ham.
Plus, the Bud and Iron City were
free.

While we were giving the
buffet our undivided attention, the
camera men started yelling,
“Move out of the way. Move out
of the way.” What the hell? I did-
n’t know what was going on. The
idiots set up their cameras and
wanted the people to move so
they could get a view of the tele-
vision.

Then, I saw Catherine Baker
Knoll. Oh my god! The woman
had on the most hideous shoes
and matching purse that I have
ever seen in my life. I’ll explain.
They were red, white, blue and
gold (yes, the shoes and the
purse.) Written in patched leather
was, “Election 96” (deﬁnitely not
Chanel). There were donkeys on
them to represent the Democratic
Party.

We left soon after Knoll and
her mother spoke. I have to say it

‘was the most fun I’ve had since
they closed down Zelda’s
Greenhouse.

Christene Muller wishes that
every day was Election Day.

BC 8 problems
have only
just begun

 

Even though they were before
my time and their legend has gone
down in history —— with Karen being an
anorexic to the point of death — The
Carpenters are back in the spotlight.
Well, kinda sort of. V,

“We’ve only just begun” has
become the theme of the Boston
College-led probe into the ills of gam-
bling among NCAA athletes. I have a
feeling that the problem up in Newton,
Mass. is just the start of a mad dash of
players getting nabbed for laying down
cash on games, whether it is on their
own team or not.

Fort Cherry star Brandon King,
grandson of Don King, is one of the
many players who have been named in
the allegations. As of today, 13 players

Women's soccer finishes in style

,.$9!‘°"°

~ .-2 ,:a-.,.. 

The women’s soccer team
closed out their inaugural season in
style last night when they defeated
Robert Morris 2-0. .

This was Pitt’s third win of the
season under Head Coach Roland
Sturk. The game was also Senior
Recognition Night at Pitt Stadium.
Since it was the Lady Panthers’
first season, they had only one
graduating senior, midfielder Tracy
Mascari. Fittingly, Mascari scored
the game winning goal, her fourth
of the season. -

At 76:21, Mascari lofted a shot

from the left hashmark that sailed
0 over the Robert Morris goalkeep-

er’s head and found the upper left
pocket of the goal. Mascari fin-
ished tied for third on the team
with nine points, behind Megan
Beasley (12 points) and Mia Mora
(10 points).

Mascari’s goal was an uplifting
end to her Panther career and Pitt’s
season.

“It’s a nice way to finish a
career,” Sturk said. “It’s been hard
for [Mascari] because it’s been
three or four years since she’s
played. But she’s a good, mature
player.”

Following Mascari’s goal, the
Lady Panthers put the Colonials
away with Megan Beasley’s goal at
74:27. "

The‘ goal was
Rachel Bertges.

bounced off the Colonial goalie
and Beasley cleaned up the mess,
burying the ball into the bottom of
the net for her team-leading sixth
goal.

Pitt completely dominated the
game against the Crosstown-rival
Colonials. The Lady Panthers out-
shot the Colonials 24-3.

The Lady Panthers controlled
the tempo in the first half but were
unable to put the ball in the net.
The second half started with three
close misses on shots by Bertges
before Mascari’s goal.

Following the game, Sturk was
happy with his team’s hustle and
enthusiasm and hopes it will carry

into next season.

“All year long our kids have
progressed both individually and
collectively,” Sturk said. “We still
have a lot of growing up to do. But
you could see the progression
throughout the season.”

' Sturk had an extremely young
squad that featured 14 freshmen.
As these. players mature, Sturk
looks forward to the future possi-
bilities.

“In some ways, I’m very opti-
mistic [for next season],” Sturk
commented. “We have a core of six
to eight players who I think will be
competitive and hopefully we’ll
have a few more wins.”

   

Temperamental crowds can't stop Piﬂ hockey

onnie Nigro

. Bill Elliott’s -and Ryan Moore’s two
goals led the Pitt hockey team to a 4-3
win over Allegheny last Saturday in
Meadville. The win brings Pitt’s overall
record to 3-1-1 and its division record to
2-0-1. ‘

Elliott opened the scoring at 9:26 of
the ﬁrst period. His unassisted goal gave
Pitt a 1-0 lead.

Less than one minute later, Elliott
scored again, assisted by Chris Bickell,
giving Pitt a 2-0 lead.

“Bill’s second goal showed a lot that
he’s thinking more,” Head Coach Dickie
Rizzo said. “The first goal he just walked
in and scored. The second one was a
more patient goal.”

Elliott’s second goal hushed a tem-
peramental Allegheny crowd.

‘The crowd was getting to Bill,” said
Patrick Kenny, Pitt’s staiting goalie.

Elliott turned the fan’s taunts into a
two-goal game for himself.

“He danced around the one defense-

man,” Kenny said of Elliott’s second
goal. “The kid almost fell down he beat
him so bad.” 0

But with 3:03 left in the ﬁrst period,
Allegheny got on the scoreboard, making
it 2-1.

The Panthers didn’t take long to
answer back and with 50 seconds left in
the ﬁrst, Moore scored on an assist by
Tony Hermankevich, giving Pitt a 3-1
lead.

Allegheny retaliated quickly and
scored a goal with just 15 seconds left,
cutting Pitt’s lead to one.

VV1th a total of ﬁve goals scored in
the first period, a scoreless second period
would seem to pale in comparison, but it
didn’t. Although there were no goals in
the second, there were deﬁnitely saves,
especially by Pitt’s Kenny.

“They must have takenisix or seven
good shots,” Matt White said. “Patrick
was totally sprawled on the ice. They
ﬂipped the puck up in the air to go top
shelf. Out of nowhere, his blocker hand
smacked the puck away with his fmger-
tips. It was the sweetest save so far this

99
a

year

Kenny’s saves in that ﬂurry were far
from ﬁnished. After swatting the puck
away, Allegheny got it back at the blue
line and blasted a shot.

“The shot came from the point. I did-
n’t even see it,” Kenny said. “I went
down into a split and made a glove save.”

All this occurred while Kenny‘ had
no goalie stick because it got knocked
away and with Allegheny enjoying a
two-man advantage, Kenny couldn’t
have picked a better time to come up with
the big saves.

Five minutes into the third period,
Pitt took some pressure off their goalie
when Moore scored his second goal of
the contest, assisted by Matt Danzuso,
giving Pitt a 4-2 lead.

“After a 4-2 lead, we were playing
defensively,” Elliott said. “We weren’t
worried about scoring, we just wanted to
defend the lea .” ‘ C

Pitt’s lead was threatened with just
ﬁve ‘minutes left in regulation when
Allegheny scored a “controversial” goal.

BC gambling scandal

- Thirteen Boston College football players
are being suspended for sports gambling.
' A local prosecutor says two of them
bet against BC when the Eagles lost to
Syracuse last month.

However, District Attorney Thomas
Reilly says there is no evidence of point-
shaving and no evidence that the outcome
or score of any game was affected.

Neither player has been identiﬁed.
Reilly says the investigation continues.

Boston College was at the center of a
basketball point-shaving scandal in 1982.

Can Goldberg hang with fiery red hot Longo?

  

When Steve Pederson was hired as
Pitt’s athletics director, the media asked
him about the brutal non-conference
schedules which Pitt typically plays.
Pederson responded that he is in favor of
crafting future schedules so that the
Panthers can “hit the ground running”
when they get to the Big East portion of
their schedule. In other words, look for
plenty of games against teams like Kent
and Northern Illinois, so that Pitt can be
a healthy 3-1 or 4-0 by the time they hit

 

the Big East. To this idea, I have only

two things to say: “Here Here” and-

“Amen.”

Some in the local media will say that
Pitt can’t afford to schedule Cupcake U
because such a team won’t draw any
fans to Pitt Stadium, as college football
analyst (and Pitt alumnus) Beano Cook
suggested last week. Cook knows his
college football, but such reasoning is
shortsighted and ﬂat wrong. When Pitt
brings N otre Dame to Pitt Stadium, they
sell out for that game. But if Pitt light-
ens its schedules, the team will start win-
ning consistently, season ticket sales will
eventually go up, Golden Panther dona-
tions will rise, and the program as a
whole will get healthier. And a healthy,

winning program means that Pitt will fill
the stadium not for one game against
Notre Dame, but for every game.

It would take two to four years of
consistent winning to pull it off, but I
guarantee you it would happen. If you
need proof, consider this: in 1982, a Pitt
program that had been winning consis-
tently for nine years, averaged 54,818
per game ——- less than 2,000 short of a
sellout ——- and, most signiﬁcantly, sold
out the Temple game.

West Virginia (7-2) at Rutgers (2-
6) — Don Nehlen is one of the best

time. While Dwayne Schulters was
scurrying into the end zone, the Eagle
secondary was fidgeting with their
units around the 5—yard—line. Hey, I
don’t know about you. but that’s my
ESPN highlight.

Take away the betting and the
fact that Pitt had to be involved. some-
what, in this scandal, and I’d still have
a huge problem with all of this. Fine,
betting on your own team should be a
no—no in any sports because any player
on the team can change the outcome at
any time. But what about betting in
general?

I’m getting sick of how the
NCAA acts as the judge and jury when
it comes to the lives of intercollegiate
athletes. The NCAA says when players
can and can’t work. They say where
and when these players can work and
even how much they can make. God
forbid a player needs to use a car to get
to work. The snoops at NCAA head-
quarters are doing everything outside
of administering enemas to these ath-
letes and it’s getting pretty old.

I think it’s funny that BC play-
ers bet on games, even better that they
bet against their own team. Heck, if the
NCAA is going to try and catch every
college athlete who has bet on sports,
pro or college, then they better give up
on any future ventures because they
have their work cut out for them.

Think about it. If every player
on every team was suspended for bet-
ting on games, either in an office poll
or with a bookie, then who would be
left? (Hey, I’ve got a pretty good arm,
Mr. Majors.) Then again, it would only
be a matter of time before my history

“I came out to cut down the angle and
the shot went off my arm,” Kenny said. “I
hit it between my legs and then hit it
away.”

Before Kenny hit the puck away, it
settled behind him near the goal line.

“I didn’t think it went in,” Kenny
said. “The ref at the blue line made the
call. I was a little agitated at him for call-
ing it a goal.”

Despite getting a bad call, the
Panthers held onto the lead and won.

“It was a big game for us. We needed
it,” Kenny said. “It’s probably the best
game we played.”

Several key players stepped up and
played their best games of the season.

“Toki Baron played the best game
I’ve ever seen him play,” Rizzo said.
“Tony Hermankevich is playing phenom-
enal hockey out there too.”

The Panthers will look to carry some
of the momentum into their game on

got out. Sorry, I admit, one time when
I was drunk, I bet that Pitt would lose.
Would that count since I wouldn’t have
been a part of the team at that time?

I think the NCAA should quit
worrying about what players are doing
with their free time and extra money;
last time I checked there still was no
playoff. Listen to Pink Floyd and leave
these kids alone.

There is such an uneven distri-
bution of power in the collegiate foot-
ball ranks, as well as in other sports,
that players would be crazy not to bet
on games, even if they involve their
own team. My message to the NCAA
is to stop being so picky and let these
people have their freedom because we

all know that all sports are ﬁxed any-
way, so why not have a little fun with
them in the process‘?

Too many players are out there
stealing, beating their girlfriends, and
doing serious drugs. There is no way
that gambling even belongs in the
same sentence as these heinous crimes.

Now that I think about it even
more, it’s really strange that all of this
information is coming out after BC
lost to Pitt. Can things get any more
embarrassing for the Panthers?

I bet they can. Check the line
for November 16.

Get on the Bus is

Spike Lee's best yet

Get on the Bus

Directed by: Spike Lee
Screenplay by: Reggie
Bythewood

Rock

With Get on the Bus, Spike Lee
returns to his roots — the type of
ﬁlmmaking he does best. The $2.4
million venture (funded entirely by
15 African—Americans and filmed in
18 days) is by far his best film since
Do the Right Thing. Using an inter-
esting combination of Super 16mm
and Hi—8 video, Lee’s documentary-
style piece cannot simply be labeled
as a “black film;” such a narrow
judgement does Lee’s picture no jus-
tice. The story presented here is
instead universal, and the character
conﬂicts are resolved by self—dis—
covery and self—reliance — two
things impartial to color or creed.

Backed by writer Reggie
Bythewood’s solid screenplay and
Elliot Davis’ innovative cinematog-
raphy, Lee tells the story of a group
of African—American men that take a

bus from south central LA. to
Washington D.C. to take part in the
Million Man March (Oct. 16, 1995).
Although organized by minister
Louis Farrakhan, the film’s focus is
less on the controversy surrounding
the march and more on the real
drama of African—American men
uniting from all over the country for
a common cause. Accordingly, the
film focuses on the individuals of
the march, the men that collectively
learn to re-evaluate their under-
standings of each other, and ulti-
mately themselves.

Bythewood further heightens
each character conﬂict by making
the men complete strangers to one
another, separated by seemingly
unconquerable boundaries. We learn
about the characters as they learn
about each other, which allows us to
avoid stereotyping or generalizing
them based on their religion, occu-
pations, sexual orientation, etc. But
most importantly, the dialogue and
dramatic subtlety of the screenplay

March in Spike Lee’s Get on the Bus.

immediately draw us into a powerful
story of reconciliation. Indeed, the
characters serve as an effective
microcosm for the larger communi-
ty, and the topics discussed between
them range from social issues such
as homophobia and anti—Serr1itism to
familial dilemmas, such as runaway
fathers, gang—bangers, and so on.

Ossie Davis (“Da Mayor” in Do
the Right Thing) gives yet another
touching performance as Jeremiah,
the ultimate patriarchal figure for
the group. Evan Sr. (Thomas Byrd)
and his teenage son, Evan Jr.
(Deaundre Bonds) — or “Smooth”
as he prefers to be called —— provide

with anything. But I have been avoiding

have thoroughly lis-
tened to their new
CD. I admittedly am
not too turned on by
this CD, but that
doesn’t mean you
shouldn’t go to this
show. Here is my most objective analysis
of Jonathan Fire*Eater (in case you have
different taste than me):

The CD lists drurris, a guitar, a bass,
an organ, a lap steel, a piano, maracas, and
vocals as the instrumental line-up. The
seemingly most important player involved
in this is the vocalist, Stewart Lupton,
because it is the voice that carries and
defines virtually all of the songs. Second in
the hierarchy of instrumental domination
is handed alternatively to the organ and the
drurris. The drums form a consistent thread
through all of the songs, but when the
organ is used it is hard to override its alfect
on the song.

Thus, it is vital for one to like
Lupton’s voice and appreciate the sound
of Jonathan Fire*Eater’s organ — it isn’t
Stereolab. The tone of the organ has more
of a Charlatans U.K. and Doors sound.
Their sound isn’t “dancy” like the
Charlatans U.K., but it deﬁnitely isn’t hard

I‘ yoli ik ave, ou’|| love Jonathon ire*Eter. I

to associate what you hear with the Doors.
JF*E is a bit too much on the loungy side
to appeal to all Doors fans (or repulse all of
those who aren’t into them), but the rhyth-
mic, simple organ melodies coupled with
Lupton’s overwhelming voice create a
strong link with the aesthetic of the Doors.

There are probably many JF*E fans
who would cringe at this description, so
I’ll stop talking about the Doors. The main
reason the vocals and organ are an impor-
tant element of the songs is because the
guitars are mixed to an ambient level, and
the bass mostly functions to highlight the
bass drum. The result of this union is a
really driving, primitive beat, which is
actually really appealing (I’m drifting
from the subjective). This aspect of their
music is really reminiscent of bands like
the Fall and the Birthday Party (hence the
Nick Cave comparisons). This bass—heavy
beat is best utilized in their first song of the
CD, “The Search for Cherry Red.” Here

a direct description
of is Lupton’s
vocals. It is sort of
a touchy thing to
address because
the success of JF*E
depends on Lupton
as a worthy front man. At most times his
voice is like a drunken cry, juxtaposed
with a deep bellow once in a while.
Although this might sound just great to
you, the vocals are delivered in a similar
way in each song, and Lupton’s voice is
the most consistently used instrument, so
you’d better really like his singing.

What concerns us here, though, is
JF*E live. I’ve never seen them so here’s a
quote from Time Out NY: “All very poet-
ic and grotesque  it’s astonishing to wit-
ness a Fire*Eater gig: wall to wall danc-
ing, trancing, and French kissing. And
that’s to say nothing of what’s happening
onstage.” So maybe Lupton does carry his
weight. Maybe their CD is insigniﬁcant in
this discussion when there’s “dancing,
trancing, and French kissing” involved.
Only one way to ﬁnd out. Jonathan
F ire*Eater is playing at Charlie 3‘ Nov. 12
at 8pm. Also playing — Mount McKinleys
and Jumbo.

 

Die Schwartze Krahe Cabaret
The Nick Cave One Acts
I.V. Productions
After their success with 27,

Intravenous Productions (Joel Lee Kulp
and Aaron Christian Harmes) have just
completed their second project, “Die
Schwartze Krahe Cabaret”. For those of
us who are less ﬂuent in Gennan “The
Nick Cave One Acts”.

Cabaret theatre, or audience interac-
tive, was popular in Europe during the early
part of this century. Thankfully, Kulp and
Harmes have brought it back in all its glory.
Kulp summed it up by saying “Cabaret tlie—
atre lirnits the separation between the action
of the play and the audience. You can’t get
away from it; it infects you.”

I couldn’t agree more. The production
includes various ﬁlm clips which add to the
already “in your face” stylization. Harmes

believes video to be a
dramatically useful
device. “With ﬁlm we
can hit as many senses
as possible. The play
setsamoodandtheﬁlm 4
allows us to take it a “
step farther enabling the
audience to see things
that aren’t possible to
do on stage.”

The first few plays
are slices of life that
deal with such issues as
aggression, sex, and
religion. The second half of the show
includes ﬁve short scenes between Solome
(Marie Sirokos) and John the Baptist (Glen
Hackett). Much of the content of the play is
controversial. The question of whether or
not Cave is a rriisogynist is one that can only
be answered by the individual. Kulp and
Harmes are more than a little excited for
audience interpretation. “We expect some
people to be offended But then we want

Krahe Cabaret,” based on the writings of Nick Cave.

want them to ask themselves why they were
offended. Through questioning the morality
of the characters, people will question
therr1selves.”

The show runs until the 9th with a rnid—
night show Saturday night and is being per-
formed in the basement of the Cathedral.
Expect to be shocked, overwhelmed, and
thoroughly entertained by this fearless piece
of brilliance.

20

Over 20 years before MTV came up
with their idea to turn real life into a sit-
com, two ﬁlmmakers sought to record
the actual events in one family and trans-
late it into a television series. It was the
real thing - the Real World. The charac-
ters didn’t live in an urban dreamland,
they didn’t have 50 grand to start a busi-
ness, and they did have to pay rent.

On Jan. 11, 1973 this documentary
about the Loud family debuted on PBS as
An American Family. This series of 12
one-hour episodes instantly became one
of the most popular media events in the
country. Alan and Susan Raymond were
the ﬁlmmakers behind this project that
chronicled the Loud family for nearly a
year. Together they recorded over 300
hours of the Loud life.

The setting was Santa Barbara,

THE PITT‘ NEWS

California. Pat, Bill, and their ﬁve chil-
dren, Lance, Kevin, Grant, Deliah, and
Michele were the characters in this real
life soap opera. During the year this fam-
ily was in the spotlight, their personal
dramas were shared with millions. The
disintegration of Pat and Bill’s 20-year
marriage was documented, and during
this year Lance decided to publicly come
out of the closet.

This month, on Fridays and
Saturdays, the Warhol Museum will
show episodes from An American Family
in the Museum Theater. The major attrac-
tion concerning this show, though, hap-
pens this Friday, Nov. 8, at 7:30. Lance
Loud and Susan and Alan Raymond will

 

be at the Warhol to discuss the phenome-

non of this show and its relationship to

Warhol.

What does Warhol have to do with
An American Family? Lance Loud had
been a devoted fan since his early teens.
In fact, the word “devoted” could be
replaced with “obsessed.” Lance sent
Warhol many letters in the late ‘60s,
which the artist kept, and they are now on
display at the Museum in the archives for
an exhibition of Warhol’s fan mail. These
letters, obviously written by a young
Loud, contain pleas for response (“Write
Soon! Please?”) and such personal reve-

lations as: “I probably love you but you

are a wonderful person  aren’t you?”

Thursday, November 7, ‘I996

Lance sent Warhol gifts, such as a kalei-
doscope and a jacket, and continuously
called Warhol. Included in the exhibit are
two photos that Loud sent Warhol of him-
self topless, one in front a huge Warhol
poster, that are placed next to a letter that
is childishly signed: “Bye, Love, Your
Best Only Friend, Lance Loud.”

Before Lance Loud’s and the
Raymonds’ discussion begins, episode
two of the series will be shown. In this
episode, Lance takes his mother on a tour
of New York City and it includes perfor-
mances by Candy Darling, Lackie Curtis,
and Ondine, as well as a visit to the
Whitney Museum for a Warhol retro-
spective. You can catch either the discus-
sion or the series screening with your
museum admission. For more info call
237-8300.

for poignant moments in the film as
well. A court order requires that
“Smooth” be shackled to his father for
72 hours dueto a prior misdemeanor
charge. The symbolic physical and
emotional restraint serves as an effec-
tive metaphor for oppression on a much
larger scale. All in all, the entire cast
(including Andre Braugher and Roger
Smith) pulls off numerous close—quarter
conflicts and confrontations impres-

sively, and by the film’s final coda, we ‘

are moved by the screenwriter’s strong
resolution and the director’s effective
closure.

George, the bus driver (Charles
Dutton), says near the end of the film:

the real “march” doesn’t start until we
as Americans “take control of our
lives.” Get on the Bus shows us that
whether we are black, white, red, or
green, we can all relate to oppression
and anger and hate. Still, we are not
bombarded with moral messages,
answers to social questions, solutions to
right and wrong. We are instead invited
to understand both sides of every issue,
to debate the issue, to discover what is
right and wrong according to our own
morals. Spike Lee’s Get on the Bus
invites us to think about ourselves
before we think about each other.
