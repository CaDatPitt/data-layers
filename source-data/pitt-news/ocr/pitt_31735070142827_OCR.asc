Students to create
inter—collegiate board
for city’s universities

. Estelle Tran
Assistant News Editor

At the peak of the tuition tax debate
in December, students regularly
attended City Council meetings to
protest the tax.

Danieljimenez doesn’t want that
to end.

“Before the tuition tax came up,
no students were going down there,”
the president of the Graduate and
Professional Student Assembly
said. '

In an impromptu meeting yester-
day on Carnegie Mellon University’s
Collaborative Innovation Center, a
group of student leaders met with
Dan Gilman, City Councilman Bill
Peduto’s chief of staff, to discuss the
creation of a student advisory com-
mittee to City Council.

Jimenez, Student Government
Board president Charlie Shull, SGB
member David Petrone and CMU
student body president Rotimi
Abimbola, hope to create a student
organization that will meetwith City
Council members foraset number of
times each year.

Shull andjimenez said that they’d
like all of the higher learning institu-
tions to be involved and the respon-
sibility to fall on the elected presi-
dents. Each president would have one
vote, but schools with large graduate
programs will receive another vote
when making decisions on issues that
pertain to students, such as public

‘A Window into the World’

Women correspondents speak to students about reporting in areas of war, genocide and conflict

For The Pitt News

Firle Davies’ job was a matter of
life and death. _

She lost friends and colleagues
while reporting in places like Si-
erra Leone, Zimbabwe and Soma-
lia. At times, she risked her life
while working in places hostile
to journalists.

Davies and other notable jour-
nalists shared their experiences
last night at the “Foreign Corre-
spondents: Women in Danger,”
event that featured four women
involved in foreign journalism.
Students and community mem-
bers attended the event, which

was organized by Cynthia Skrzy-

cki, senior lecturer in the English
department.
The panel included Nadia Trin-

idad, ABS-CBN senior political

correspondent; Firle Davies, BBC
reporter and producer; and Tara
Mahtafar, PBS Frontline manag-
ing editor. Christine Spolar, a se-
nior editor at The Hufﬁngton Post
Investigative Fund in Washington
D.C., moderated the discussion.

“They are part of a special
breed of journalists,” Skrzycki
said. ,

Skrzycki said she hoped the
event would inform students
about foreign journalism, and
highlight how difficult of a job
these women share. “They expe-
rience danger ﬁrst—hand.”

The four women told stories
about intense situations and en-
counters — at times inspiring

No, you’re not just good at “Call of Duty” be-
cause you play it eight hours a day.

It’s because you have a big brain, too, a
recent research study says.

The studywas conducted at the University
of Illinois by a team of researchers, including
Kirk Erickson, a psycholo professor at Pitt
and lead author of the study. Before coming
to Pitt, Erickson worked at the University of
Illinois as a graduate student and postdoc-
toral scholar.

Other members of the team include Ann
Graybiel, a professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and investigator for
the McGovern Institute for Brain Research;
Arthur Kramer, a psychology professor at
the University of Illinois; and Walter Boot, a
researcher from Florida State University.

The study, published Wednesday in the
journal “Cerebral Cortex,” asserts that about a
quarter of the variability of achievement seen
in men and women who are trained on a new
video game can be predicted — just by the size
of three structures in their brains.

Research shows that expert gamers trump .

their novice counterparts in both attention

' and perception. And other studies show that

even with 20 hours of training, novices still
show no signs of measurable cognitive de-
velopment. These two ﬁndings suggest that
existing individual differences in the brains
of men and women could be a predictor of
variability in learning rates, according to the
research team.

side the cerebral cortex, is a sort of learning
machine.

The team focused on three brain struc-
tures: the caudate nucleus and the putamen,
both in the dorsal striatum, and the nucleus
accumbens in the ventral striatum.

The caudate nucleus and the putamen are
both involved in motor learning, and research

This work could have enormous
implications in other areas of life.

Kirk Erickson

The research branches into other areas of
life too, Erickson said in an e—mail. '

“This work could have enormous implica-
tions in other areas of life,” he said. “It reveals
some interesting individual difference factors
in learningthat could be related to people with
learning and memory deﬁcits or degeneration
of these structures.”

Graybiel and others have conducted
animal studies that indicate the striatum, a

collection of distinctive tissues tucked in-

shows that they help with the brains cognitive
ﬂexibility — that is, how quickly it is able to
switch from task to task.

The nucleus accumbens, on the other
hand, is associated with emotions related to
reward and punishment. .

In terms ofvideo games, the researchers
chose to focus on these three structures and
question if their size is ‘related to a person’s
performance on a new video game. .

Thirty—nine healthy adults, aged 18 to 28,

  The bigger the brain, the bigger the game

were given MRI scans that analyzed these
three regions of their brains. The researchers

V required that they all had not played video

games for more than three hours a week for
the past two years.

The team trained the participants on one
of two versions of “Space Fortress,” a video
game created in the ’8os at the University of
Illinois as a tool for psychologists to study
video game playing. The game, which features
very low quality graphics, requires players
to destroy a fortress without forsaking their
own ships.

“We chose this particular game because it
allowed us to have complete control over the
different dimensions of the game — which

is very important in science,” Erickson said. ‘

“This type of control allowed us to manipu-
late certain game parameters while keeping
others constant.”

The question is, why not use real games
on the market?

This degree of control is not available in
off—the—shelf games, which would have created-
several problems in interpretation, he said.

Participants were split into two groups:

one was told to focus on obtaining a high
score while paying attention to different as-
pects of the game, and the other was told

Jimenez said he wanted this organization

to employ variable-priority training, or to
periodically shift their focus of training to
different areas.

Research shows that variable-priority
training encourages the same task in every-
day life, often improving skill.

Simply put, the researchers found that
bigger is indeed better —— when it comes to
the brain, that is.

Participants who had larger nucleus ac-
cumbens performed better in the early stages
of training. The team suggested that this was
because those players were more affected by
achieving a certain goal — the nucleus .ac—
cumbens is a part of the brain’s reward system,
after all. ‘

Additionally, those with a larger caudate
nucleus and putamen performed better on
thevariable-priority training. _ ’

Even though Erickson and his team have
hypothesized and theorized about these re-
sults, he said he still ﬁnds the way the research
works a bit shocking. ' , A

“I think on some level all scientists are
somewhat surprised that their research works
the way it does,” he said. .

“The brain remains a mystery on many lev-
els,” he said, so there is still more to learn.‘

Applications
worth the work

high school senioritis kicks

in —— ﬁnishing those college
applications. They’re time con-
suming, repetitive and can get
costly. As a result, some colleges
have developed a way to expedite
the process and make it easier on
students.

Take the College of Saint Rose
in Albany, for example. Last fall,
the school obtained a list of names
of soon—to—be graduating seniors
from the marketing departments
of credit card companies.

The school then proceeded
to send out 30,000 applications
in the mail that told prospective

It’s the final hurdle before

_ students it would not only waive

the $40 application fee, it would
also allow applicants to forego the
labor involved in writing an essay.
Students would also know their
application status within three
weeks. Saint Rose further simpli-
ﬁed the process by also obtaining
much of the students’ informa-
tion, according to The New York
Times. For the edgy senior unsure

J of where to apply, it looks like

onesweet deal. Monetarily and
time-wise, it is. However, such a_
cursory process isn’t without its
drawbacks.

The College of Saint Rose
isn’t the only school taking this
approach to recruiting students.
Last fall, over 100 other schools
sent out variations of these no-
fuss applications.

Predominant factors in con-
sidering students’ admittance fall
on their high school transcript
and standardized test scores. The
college essay, no matter how much
angst it causes in students, is an-
other staple. By eliminating this

criteria, schools only add to the
impersonal aspect of the applica-
tions process: students are looked
at as numbers, or rather, only by
their numbers. Perhaps the es-
say isn’t considered as heavily as
the hard numbers anyway, but
it’s a long-standing, ubiquitous
element.

As enticing as it is, speeding
the process up might dissuade

potential students from actually _

visiting schools or trying to ﬁnd
the schools they think would be
the best ﬁt for them. As for visit-
ing, students can get a good feel
for schools just by looking at their
Web sites and taking a virtual tour
— although nothing compares to
actually seeing a school ﬁrst—hand.
The problem is, after sending in
one of these quick and easy appli-
cations, a student might not want
to go through the seemingly even-
more laboriousprocess of ﬁlling
out applications in full. Although
students have nothing to lose by

applying to schools with no fee

—- unless a student truly wants to

. attend one of these schools — stu- .

dents shouldn’t limit their breadth
of schools to apply to because of
laziness. College takes work, and
the application process, no matter
how extensive, doesn’t compare
in scope.

The College of Saint Rose in;Al-
bany has seen a 25 percent annual
increase in applications as well
as a. rise in minority admissions.
Students are, after all, schools’
customers. Given the economy,
schools still need customers ——
despite their price tags —- and
the simpler application seems
an easy way to keep admissions
numbers up.

Whenever I can ﬁnd them, I pick
up religious pamphlets from street
corner evangelists on my way down
Forbes Avenue. When I get home, I
put them, on the refrigerator with
magnets to remind my roommates
and me to seize the day, because
the road to hell is — apparently
— already paved.

The pamphlets tell me that I
can’t get to heaven through ‘-‘good
deeds, church membership, sacra-
ments, baptism, or anything” that I
do besides believing inJesus. Man,
that’s rough. Might as well give up
now.

‘One summer, a friend of mine
founded one of the few religions
I could ever commit to following.
My parents rented our guesthouse
to Joshua, a musician from Phila-
delphia. While living in New York,
a do.cumentary ﬁlmmaker paid
him about $5,000 to start his own
church and make a documentary

about it.

Joshua was raisedjewish, and he
wasn’t concerned with the concept
of hell or an afterlife. His message
was simple: “I don’t know anything
more than you do, but maybe we
will ﬁgure it out together.”

He called the religion The
Church of Now and said that believ-
ing in God was optional. The only
sin in the new faith, which drew
on elements of Buddhist, Taoist
and New Age thinking, was not liv-
ing life to the fullest. Joshua didn’t
proselytize, but rather carried a

sign asking people to talk to him‘

about “Living in the now.”

The Church of Now was founded
shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. New Yorkers were shaken
and depressed, and Joshua aimed
to make them feel better about the
present. He went to Wall Street
with‘ a box of red rubber clown
noses and passed them out to men
in starchy business suits, Muslim
women in hijabs and taxicab driv-
ers. A few construction workers
took handfuls for their children.
Meanwhile, he broadcasted his

message on a megaphone. “Let’s
ﬁgure out how to be happy togeth-
er!” he implored.

Of course, evident problems
with the Church of Now lay at its
foundations. A 2006 New York
Times article is all that remains of
the defunct religion. People didn’t
feel comfortable ﬁguring out the
meaning of life for themselves.
Joshua only gained 14 converts.
Sadly, it seems most don’t believe
they have any moral authority.

Converts typically crave direc-
tion -— a law from on high.Joshua
never aspired to be a real messiah.
He didn’t claim to have divine wis-
dom or try to name who would or
wouldn’t be saved. The concept
quickly fell ﬂat. The ﬁlmmaker

i ran out of money and scrapped

the project. The ﬁlm footage has
long since been lost.
Televangelism works because it
offers the certainty that grassroots
foundations like the Church of Now
lack. The preachers are not inter-
ested in further scholarly pursuits
of the biblical word. They have the
answers, and they are sharing them

A few weeks ago, I attended a poetry
reading at Gist Street in Uptown

Pittsburgh. While I was there, it‘

seemed as if I’d been transported
out of the city to a new, inspiring
place. »

However, as I drove back
through the Hill District to Oak-
land, I realized that the empty lots
and buildings in disrepair repre-
sented a very different city: one that

-s;iv:%‘,faces dwindling populations and
 7 dying urban neighborhoods.

-That’s the reason why so many
people are eager to leave Pittsburgh,
whether they grew up in the city or
came here for college. It would seem
that this place doesn’t have the abil-

A ityto fulﬁll our dreams; that our

degrees would go to waste in what
some like to call a large town.
i Even though we can see the

faults in our city, the majority of
us are more interested in ﬂeeing
them, rather than ﬁxing them.

I’ve found myself thinking along

the same lines during my time in V
Pittsburgh; I’ll be honest, my re— I
lationship with this city has been ‘
sugar—coated. Having grown up in c
the suburbsof the South Hills, I’ve

never really come into contact with

the problems of neighborhoods like i

Lawrenceville or the North Side.

When we’re faced with issues '

like an inexpelrieficed mayor or a
lack of jobs, our first inclination is
to run from them. The truth is, only
through reexarninii1‘g’thesegis”s'ii1es
can we really begin to understand
how we’ve come to this juncture and
where we need to go from here.

I recently picked up Brian

O’Neill’s “The Paris of Appalachia,” ‘ H

a biography of Pittsburgh that helps
illustrates the magic of our city, in
spite of its scars. _

As a columnist for the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, O’Neill has beenwrit-

In time, Pittsburgh could make comeback

Brian O’Neill’s book, “The Paris of Appalachia, ” spotlights Pittsburglfs pros and possibilities

ing about the city for more than
20 years. He is a resident of the
North Side and he has ﬁrst-hand

' knowledge about the beneﬁts and

shortcomings of living within the
city limits.

O’Neill’s book is a must-read
for those who call Pittsburgh their
home. It helped me rediscover why

my family and I have decided to stay _

in this area. It’s also given me the
motivation to explore what this city

. has to offer.

' “The Paris of Appalachia” is

- sometimes used as a pejorative
term for Pittsburgh, suggestingthat V
this city is the best of the worst.-. _  
But after reading 0’Neill’s‘*'book,_.- :~

it was obvious to me that mycity
has more to it than just the Steelers
and Pens. '

By proﬁling various ‘Pittsbur-
ghers, past and present, O’Neill is
able to capture the depth of this
city. He starts off by describing the
city’s rise to prominence through

the steel industry, its decline and ’

how people have lived since then.
The stories of residents who
are both friendly and hard—nosed
underscore O’Neill’s title for Pitts-
burgh as the “third bear”_ of cities:
not too slow and not too fast.
Many of O’Neill’s anecdotes
traverse the local businesses that
carry the history of this city. He

' ﬁnds different versions of Pitts-

burgh’s story in bars," restaurants
and barber shops. 

I Once he ﬁnisheshis fun—ﬁlled
stories about food and beer, O’Neill
assumes a more serious tone as he
addresses the chaﬂengés Pittsburgh

   

regulating the annexation of land
in Pa. _'_  A
These laws have made expand-

 i'ng'Pittsburgh sucii a difﬁcult task

that we’ve fallen from the eighth to
57th—largest American city in the

V years since 191o..By leaving the
to merger of townships up to their
residents," it became nearly impos-

sible for Pittsburgh to incorporate
new areas into the city limits.

When comparing Pittsburgh to
other major American cities, I see
that it’s obvious why we’re so much
smaller. Cities like Houston and
Phoenix are nearly the size of Al-
legheny County. Unlike Pittsburgh,
these cities have been allowed to
expand tremendously.

Furthermore, the disintegration
of so many areas around’Pittsburgh
has led to problems including high
taxes and overlapping administra-
tions.

The question is, where do we go
from here? Can Pittsburgh bounce
back?

According to O’Neill, we can.
And doing so might just be an issue
of time. Pittsburgh has been able
to survive thus far. As the country
faces uncertain times, past experi-
ences might just be in our favor.

Wyclef’s heart is inthe right place

Wyclef Jean defends money use for foundation Yele Haiti on YouTube and Oprah

Kelsey Shea
Asst. A E5’ E Editor

When the Jan. 12 earthquake hit
Haiti, Wyclefjean had no idea how
much it would affect him.

The Haitian rapper and musi-
cian began working to help his
country long before the earth-
quake destroyed its capital, Port-
au-Prince. In 2005, he founded

the organization Yele Haiti, which -

helped the country through the af-
termath of Hurricane Jeanne and
provides scholarships to Haitian

H children.

]ean’s last album, 2009’s From
the Hut, to the Projects, to the
Mansion, chronicled the life of the
Haitian revolutionary, Toussaint
L’Ouverture.

Considering his deep involve-
ment with the country, it was no
great surprise that Jean leapt into
action just hours after the earth-
quake hit. He was all over the news,
repeating the phrase, “We must act
now.”

But just days afterjean and Yele
Haiti had fully mobilized, news
sources such as The Smoking Gun
and the Washington Post looked
into charges, “for costs other than

providing beneﬁts to Haitians in
need.”

Finance problems are hardly
uncharted territory forjean, whose
Miami beach house was foreclosed

ﬁling required state disclosure re-
ports. So it’s not hard to believe
that this new scrutiny raised some
eyebrows.

But through multiple public
statements, a YouTube video and
an appearance on Oprah, Jean ada-
mantly asserted his innocence and
his passionate efforts.

“I gotta tell you, coming back
in here after digging kids up  and
ﬁnding cemeteries for them  this
is what I come back to: an attack on

Slow Club satisfying folk  

Larissa Gula

Slow Club
Yeah, So
Moshi Moshi

Rocks Like: Tilly and the Wall, The Moldy
Peaches
Grade: B+

Twelve songs, 12 relationships, one al-
bum. Slow Club’s worthy folk-rock album,
Yeah, So, is composed of narratives about
love and friendship.

Slow Club launches into its album with a
slow opening — acoustic guitar and harmo-
nizing vocals that bring to mind a modern-
day, updated Simon and Garfunkel.

Updated, meaning that Slow Club is a
male/female duo and folk—rock band, with
band members Charles Watson and Rebec-
ca Taylor embellishing the contemporary
music with their own styles and sounds.

The band’s folk nature makes some
tracks calming and soothing in style, while
other songs are more saturated with drums.
The vocals always support the song, rather
than the music supporting the vocalists
— this a1bum’s about the lyrics, ﬁrst and
foremost.

Titles aren’t mystifying on this album.
“Givin’ Up On Love” is exactly what it

sounds like — why bother falling in love
when so much has gone wrong? This par-
ticular song shows the, duo’s rock roots,
especially when compared to the quiet
opening song, “When I G0,” which explores
a friendship versus a marriage. “When I Go”
demonstrates the band’s ability to alternate
between rock and folk sounds.

On the other hand, “Apples and Pairs”
displays more conﬁdence from the couple.
It’s not necessarily perfect, yet not quite
as imperfect as other songs.. Its style is

slow and charming, and sounds a bit like

a carousal song. —

Ultimately, the album avoids over-
crowding, yet allows the music to feel full
and complete — it generally satisﬁes the
listener.

day—to—day toils of being an undergraduate
student.

Yet with Superman-like multitasking skills,
Maize not only juggled work, class and music,
she drew inspiration from all of these experi-
ences to become a more well-rounded musi-
cian.

“A lot of my classes —- media criticisms, TV
and society and some of my history classes —
kind of opened my mind to what was going on
in the world. I’ve always been a bleeding heart, -
but once I really saw how the ‘world worked,
I was not very happy with what I saw,” Maize
said. “So my writing kind of turned from per-
sonal ‘issues to those having to do with the
world.  that was kirid of the turning point
where I sort? of felt like I’ was a Ehannelfifor
something bigger than myself.” I I A

’ With its irresistibly catchy beats and fo-
cus on world issues, Maize’s music resembles
something like Lady Gaga remixing a public
service announcement with a hip—hop twist
— a delicious combination that’s difficult to
put into words.

“I have a very hard time describing my
sound,” Maize said. “I would say conscious
hip—hop with a variety of dance. I use a lot of
Baltimore club, so that’s inﬂuenced my music
a lot. And I sing, also.” '

A native of New Berlin, Pa., Maize has been

She even created a rap group at age 9 with

“We were like Salt—n—Pepa at the time,”

a lot of angst, more than the average teenager.
I was very into Tori Amos and Fiona Apple, so
when I listened to them, I was kind of like, ‘I
want to do that,”’ Maize said.

But it was the exasperation of overwork
that eventually pushed Maize into her hip-
hop career.

“When I graduated  Iwas super burnt out.
So I was like, ‘I’m going to recordmusic, be-
cause I’m really sick of working crazy like this.’
I had to make money, so I started working at
the Pittsburgh City Paper in promotion. I kind
of worked my way up to being the events and
promotion director. During the last year at the
paper, I started my own business, Nakturnal,
an events and promotion company.”

As a workaholic with experience in event
promotion, it’s no surprise that Maize’s Friday
night release party, which will take place at the
Strip District’s FATE Lounge at 9 p.m., will be
more than just the standard affair.

“It is deﬁnitely going to be a spectacle,”
Maize said.

In addition to Maize’s performance — com-
plete with ﬁve different sets and Lady Gaga-
esque costume changes -— there will be belly
dancers, ballerinas, local emcees, photogra-
phy, artwork, a jeweler, free drinks, a raffle to
beneﬁt Haiti and the premiere of Maize’s Web
site, among other things.

Even though Jean has never had much
luck with ﬁnances, I think his intentions are
sincere. He’s a musician, not a banker. It’s
no great shock that he’s made mistakes with
large amounts of money. He hired new ac-
countants for the charity just to be safe. His
interests are clearly vested in Haiti — not
in himself. - A

The poor guy watched his home get de-
stroyed, worked hard to help, got put under
some pretty serious public scrutiny and still
managed to make some genuinely impressive
efforts to beneﬁt his tiny island nation.

He participated in a huge beneﬁt concert
with other big name artists like ]ay—Z, Alicia
Keys and Beyonce that raised $61 million for

- Haiti. Only ﬁve days after the earthquake, Yele

Haiti raised over a million dollars, and he even
went to Haiti himself to see the destruction
and to help pull dying people from the rubble.
That shows a hell of a lot of character.

So hats off to you, Jean. You stepped up to
the plate when your country needed you, went
above and beyond the call of duty, pushed
through a major media crisis and still man-
aged to make a difference in Haiti.

Three years ago D.j. Kennedy and De-
Juan Blair teamed up to lead Schenley
High School to the state charnpion-
ship.

Kennedy returns to his hometown
of Pittsburgh, where his high school
friend became a college star, to play

mstonight. His St. John’s Red Storm

(12—7, 2-5 Big East) will take on No.
17 Pitt at the Petersen Events Center
at 7 p.m.
Pitt (15-4, 5-2), meanwhile, will
not only try to stop Kennedy — who
’ leads St. John’s with 15.3 points per
game .— but also stop a losing streak.
The Panthers fell to Seton Hall, 64-61,
Sunday, four days after losing to No.
12 Georgetown.
Pitt center Gary McGhee said the
recent losses won’t faze the team

" ’ * when they play St._Iohn’s.

“Confidence isn’t an issue,”
McGhee said. “We did some things
that costus games: turnovers against
Seton Hall and defensive mishaps
down the stretch against George-
town.”

Pitt coachjamie Dixon agreed that
turnovers have hurt his team recently.
The Panthers gave the ball away 20
times against Seton Hall.

“You out-rebound by 14, and then

you don’t end up winning the game,”
Dixon said. “That’s strictly based on
the number of turnovers  We have
to cut that down.”

The offense, which clicked in vic-
tories over Syracuse and Louisville,
sputtered against the Pirates. Dixon
reiterated that the solution to Pitt’s
problems is to limit turnovers versus
St. John’s.

“We’ve got to play our guys more

that will make us better.”

Men’s track team places second, women ﬁnish sixth.

Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ Writer

Although it’s only January, Pitt’s
track and ﬁeld season is already
underway.

The team competed in the Car-
le/Health Alliance Classic at the

2.-sUniversity of Illinois in Urbana-

Champaign, Ill. this past weekend.

The men’s team ﬁnished second

and the women came in sixth.
For the men, junior Dontave

Cowsette won the 600-meter run
with a dominating ﬁnal time of 1
minute, 20.42 seconds.

“Last year, as a freshman, he
had a tough time adjusting,” coach
Alonzo Webb said. “We knew he
was talented, but he just had to
get a year under his belt, and this
year he’s gone to a different level
and he competed very well.”

Sophomore Jermaine Lowery
came in ﬁfth place in the 400-
meter, running it in 49.78 sec-
onds. His time was good enough

to qualify him for the Big East
Outdoor Championships in late
April.

On the women’s side, junior
Victoria Toso won the pole vault
with a height of 3.35 meters, while
senior Erinn McMahon came in
second place in the pentathlon
with 3,104 points. Her second-
place ﬁnish in the event came in
large part because of her stellar
performances in the high jump,
long jump and shot put.

While the Panthers were un-

able to ﬁnish in ﬁrst place, Webb
said that was never the actual
goal. Early season meets such as
this one are more about personal
improvement than beating the
host team, which almost always
has a decisive advantage.

“We didn’t go into the meet
with any expectations at all,”
Webb said. “We were looking for
improvements.” A

The Panthers travel to State
College, Pa. for the Penn State Na-
tional Open this weekend. While

fanthers improve after Illinois tournament

the meets up to this point have
had more of an exhibition-like
feel to them, this weekend marks
the ﬁrst meet where the team will
be looking for results.

“We’re really trying to prepare
ourselves for the next meet. This
coming weekend is the weekend
where we’re looking to have good
performances from everybody,”
Webb said. “It usually gives us an
indication of how well our team’s
going to do the rest of the sea-
son.”

Peyton and Brett aredifferent chapters in the same book

Manning leads a comeback and heads to the Super Bowl, Favre throws game‘—deciding interception and will watch from home.

Evan Burgos
Senior Staff Writer

While Brett Favre was writing the latest chapter
in the same old book this past Sunday, Peyton
Manning was writing a new one.

Favre concluded the story of his career
with the same ending — an interception that
eventually lost his team a playoff battle and a
comprehensive comeback to propel his team
to the biggest game of all.

e For all the talk and attention good ol’ num-
ber ‘4’ has received this year, amid the “one
of the greatest of all-time” rhetoric and the

C fantasy of a story—book ending for Favre, not

nearly enough attention has been paid. to Man-
ning, who is quietly staking his claim as THE
best of all time. And this championship Sunday
signaled loudly what may be the deﬁnitive
legacies of both quarterbacks.

As it stands today, Favre is the owner of
nearly every major NFL passing record. He’s
got the most completions in league history,
the most passing attempts, the most yards,
the most touchdowns, the most regular season
wins and most consecutive games started —

 

20min 8: TOminBedsoOnly

by anyone. He owns a bevy of playoff passing
records as well. Oh, and he’s thrown the most
interceptions too.

Peyton Manning is in the top 10 of all those
categories as. well as the top four for wins,
completions, yards and touchdowns. He is
34th in interceptions.

This season, Favre was truly one of the best
in the game. At 40 years of age, he led the Vi-
kings to 12 wins and one playoff victory. But
against the Saints in the NFC Championship
game, Favre did what we know him to do best:
he threw an interception on what could have

been the game ending drive and Minn. lost

in overtime. , . _

It was the second time in the past three
seasons that Favre has tossed the eventual
game-losing pickinthe conference champion-
ship game. It’s the third time.since 2003 he’s
been intercepted on a potential game-winning
drive in the playoffs, his team eventually losing
the contest.

_V So while Favre was reliving the past, Man-
ning was redeﬁning his. Down 17-6 late in the
ﬁrst half against the Jets, Manning showed
why he might soon have a place in the Sports

Panthers are confident,

need to play smarter  

Red Storm 4 10 l

on said. “Seeinghis ﬁnger [against Seton Hall],
you didn’t think he’d be back in the game.”

Pitt lost leads in the second half of both last
week’s defeats, but the coach said that’s just
typical Big East play and not indicative of a lack
of conﬁdence.

“We could’ve lost the Louisville game and
won the Seton Hall game just as easily,” Dixon
said. “We got to play well enough early, and not
be in those situations.”

Despite its losing streak, Pitt still leads the
Big East in defense, giving up 60.1 points on
average. However, Dixon doesn’twanthis team
to become complacent.

“We could have been the best defensive team
‘in the" league —— in the country —— and we’d still
say it’s not good enough,” Dixon said. “We need.
to take strides defensively.”

Pitt allowed Seton Hall to shoot44.6 percent
from the ﬂoor on Sunday.

“We have to get back to doing what we do
best,” Brown said. “Even the game we won
against Louisville, we still letthem shootahigh

percentage.”

Besides the Pittsburgh native Kennedy, St.
John’s also looks to junior Dwight Hardy forhis
11.8 points per game. In addition, three weeks
ago, the Red Storm welcomed senior forward
Anthony Mason Jr. back from the injured list.
As a sophomore last season, Mason scored 29
points against Pitt.

“Their team changed alotwith Mason back,”
McGhee said. “He’s a big-time scorer.”

Jamie Dixon said that St.John’s may still be
easing Mason back into the lineup, just as he
easedjermaine Dixon back from his foot injury
earlierthis season. ..

Pitt will try to prevent a third straight in-
conference loss against the Red, Storm; Last
week’s losses dropped Pitt to No. 17 in both the
AP and the coaches’ poll Monday, but Brown
said nobody on the team is panicking.’

“Basketball is a game of ups and downs,”

Brown said. “Better teams get it together and.

pull it out, and that’s what I think we’re going
to go. I really believe in this team, and I think
we’re going to take over in this late part of the
Big East schedule.”

Manning could be the best ever

Pantheon, alongside Michael Jordan, Wayne

Gretzky and Muhummad Ali. Manning went
17 of 23 for 250 yards and three touchdowns
from then on, leading the Colts to 24 unan-
swered points and a 30-17 victory. Game over.
Comeback sealed. Super Bowl XLIV ticket
punched.

Though Manning already has one Super
Bowl to his name, he’s laid his fair share of

last. Now,.poised to raise his second Lombardi
Trophy in the last four years, Manning is push-
ing aside history on his way to the tag of “Best
Ever.” With one more victory, he’ll be in the

‘ elite company of play callers with multiple

rings. He’ll have a shot at a third over the next
ﬁve years. In that time, he’ll probably eclipse
all of Favre’s statistical milestones. _

The ﬁnal package will be the most impres-

playoff duds. He’s lost games favored against
New England (2003 and 2004) and San Diego

. (2007 and 2008) twice, and the Steelers once

in 2005, after remarkable regular seasons.
But this year —— after a 14—win season and a
call to trial for the Colts tactic to rest players
down the stretch in favor of a pursuit of perfec-
tion — Manning led Indianapolis where they
were expected to go against the best defense
in the NFL.

This was a new Peyton. This was his greatest’

playoff performance ever and the image will

sive combination of championship prowess A

andstatistical achievement the NFL has ever
seen. Favre, for all his accomplishments, will
forever remain in the discussion of the greats.
He will strut into retirement in his Wrangler
jeans withasuper Bowl ring, three MVP awards
and whole lot of fanfare.

But he won’t be going out on top. Instead,
Favre will likely retire on the whim of a flaky
pass and crushing loss._And Manning, when
his ﬁnal snap is taken, will shine alone at the
top.
