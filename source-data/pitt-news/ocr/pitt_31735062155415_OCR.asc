Weekly Poll Of Library Users
Indicates 3 To 1 Vote

Library users voted three to one
in favor of opening the library on
Sunday afternoons, in a poll taken
by the Pitt Weekly during four days
and ending Monday, January 13.
The vote was taken at a. particular
beginning Wednesday, January 8,
time each day to get the various
opinions and special commuting stu-
dents were excluded.

Of 192 students, 143 said that
they would use the library if it
would be opened Sunday afternoons.
The vote on Wednesday was 43 to
16 for opening; on Thursday, it was
38 to 10; Friday, 14 voted for open-
ing the library, and 5 voted against;
Monday the vote was 48 to 18 in
favor.

Many of the voters suggested that
the only way to find the usefulness
of Sunday afternoon opening of the
library would be to actually try it
over a trial period.

Dice Comments

In regard to keeping the Univer-
sity library open on Sunday after-
noon‘, Dice said that he would ex-
press no opinion of the plan unless
its efﬁciency and necessity could be
proved. ’ .

“In the first place it would be an
unnecessary expense to keep the
bu‘ildifi‘g"‘open for the few"‘persons
that might take advantage of the
library. The fact that the major-
ity of the students live far from
the campus signiﬁes that the school
library would be in no great demand
on Sunday afternoons.

“The few persons who live on the
campus and who might possibly us_e
the library are not sufﬁcient to
warrant the extra expense of added
salaries, light and heat.” Mr. Dice
said that if the number of students
who desired the library open on
Sunday afternoon grew to a suffi-
cient size, he would be quite willing
to meet their demands.‘

 

LUCKNER TALKS

ON THURSDAY

The German “sea-devil,” Count
Felix von Luckner, who, during the.
World war, was said to have cap-
tured seventeen allied vessels with-
out taking a. life, will probably be
greeted by a capacity audience when

he addresses University students-at,

Memorial Hall, Thursday morning
at 11:50 o’clock, Friday schedule-in
effect. — v
Interest over the appearance here
ofthe famous adventurer is running
high and preparations are being
made by the Assembly committeefof
student council to care for the lajrg-.
est assembly audience of the year.
Telling of the interesting. tricks

employed by both sides during -the
war and relating many anecdotes-in‘

his adventurous career, the Count
will speak for more than thirty min-
utes. Von Luckner’s most famous
exploit on the side of the Central
powers during the war was in,break-
ing through the British blockade to
sink a dozen allied ships in the At-
lantic before his own raider, a Nor-
wegian windjammer, was sunk in the
South Pacific.

Since the war he has devoted his
time to cruising aimlessly about in
his yacht always in search for the
unusual. These sea wanderings have
taken him to all parts of the world
and to many ports unfrequented by
Europeans. James Dindsey, Bus. Ad.
’30, chairman of assembly commit-
tee, is expected to preside at the
von Luckner assembly. -

Cow, Deani irélalministration, Tells About ,
Reaction To Impressive Fraternity Ritual

 

.

By J. STEELE GOW , 0
Dean of Administration

A few weeks ago on a Sunday I
attended a church service in the
morning and a formal initiation of
one of our fraternities in the eve-
ning. Frankly, I am quite sure the
fraternity service was as religious
as the church service. In the fra-
ternity house that evening I saw
splendid and
ﬁrst ﬂower of their
manhood, joining the fraternity.
The ritual of initiation was read to
them by ﬁve other young men, al-
ready members of the fraternity. It
was one of the most impressive cere-
monies I have ever witnessed. All
the finest qualities of manhood
were exempliﬁed in the symbolism

of the ceremony, and the young in-
itiates were exhorted to emulate in
their lives those qualities. More

than one of the eight hit his lip and

blinked away a tear of emotion.
They were touched. I could imagine
that each one of thereight was say-
ing to himself, “God, give me
strength to be the sort of man this
fraternity would have me be.” The
souls of those young men were be-
ing reﬁned in a crucible; the dross
was being burnt away; the pure
was left.

I wished that some day I might
see my own sons experience what
these new members were experi-
encing. — ‘ y ‘

If the parents of those eight
could have been present that. night

in a cornerof the room theywould,

I am conﬁdent, have said, “It is
good.” .L, . ‘
Too often ' the surface things. of
fraternity life are the marks by
which we judge fraternities. The
social gaiety, the play-boycareless-*
ness, the sophistication of youth --
such things there are in fraternities.
It is, however, a mistake to meas-
ure the fraternity by these .~ things
alone. They are surface things. The
essential thing is what I_ witnessed
in that initiation. That stays with
the boy. It will stay with those
eight. They will be better because ‘
of it. The fraternity will be more
than a social club in their lives. It
will be aforce for clean -living.
clear thinking -and high idealism.
Certainly the University" is better
for the presence iI'1*‘.it of.‘-such . a
force as the fraternity. ~ ’ ‘

another victory when he returns

Bowen came to Pitta-from East

Pete not onlytook part in track
conrgetition, but also engaged in
foot all, basketball and swimming as
well, being one of those rare ﬁve
lettermen. When he entered Pitt, he
chose to devote hir_ns,el£_ to football,

Goes Well In Europe

Last year Pete ran in the‘100, 220

dual meets. He copped all three
of these events in every meet ex-
cept that with Ohio State, where
George Simpson, who stepped the
100 in 92-5 recently for a new
world's record, beat him in the two
shorter distances, although Pete
came back to win the 440. He toured
Europe last summer with a group
of other collegiate track champions.
He won every ‘race in which he com-
peted, at Stockholm, Eskilstuna and

in Fin and, at Copenhagen in Den-
