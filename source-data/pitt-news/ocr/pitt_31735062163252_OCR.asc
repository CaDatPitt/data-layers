Plans for a new Natural Sciences Building to replace Alumni
‘Hall are now being drafted. The Pennsylvania State Legislature
appropriated funds on August‘ 8 for the project; and ground-
breaking ceremonies are expected to take place within two years, ,
according to Dr. David Halliday, chairman of the Division of the
Natural Sciences.

The new structure, to be built in the parking lot next to
Langley Hall, will house the Chemistry Department and provide.
approximately four times the space the department now has in
Alumni Hall. Need for the new building was pointed out by Dr.
Halliday,- who described Alumni Hall as being in “disgraceful
condition for such a ﬁrst class faculty.”

. _ I According to Halliday, the present facilities for teaching and
t: V research are “inadequate,” and the physical plant, except for the
 facilities for the general chemistry courses in Clapp Hall, is “very
antiquated.” (

Greek Drama
Tryouts Begin
This Sunday

‘ Tryouts for the University
Theater’s production Euri-
pedes’ “Iphigenia in Aulis”
will begin on,Sunday, from 7
until 10 p‘.m. in the Stephen
Foster Memorial. The tryouts
will be open to the entire Uni-
versity family.

Iphigenia in Aulis will be pre-
sented on the evenings of ‘No-

vember 8 through the 14th at
Foster Memorial.

F “We will be producing the com-
plete play, including -the ' contro-

versial epilogue,” stated Bernard ‘

Engel, production co-ordinator -for
the University Theatre. »

' . Deuscx Machine

“In this epilogue Iphigenia is
not sacriﬁced for the purpose of
appeasing any angry deity, En-
gel explained. “Instead, Artemis,
the deity in question, substitutes
a ,deer‘ and carries Iphigenia off
to Taurus, the setting for Euri-
pedes’ earlier play about Iphi-
genia, Iphigenia in Taurus.

“The ‘Deus ex Machine’ tech-‘
nique,” Engel continued, “as ex-
empliﬁed by the intervention
of Artemis on behalf of Iphigc-
nia’s life was a device often
used by Artemis ‘in his plays.

“The controversy exists be-
cause certain classic scholars be-
lieve that Euripedes left this par-
ticular play in rough draft form
for a younger playwright to com-
plete later on. There is even the
speculation that the younger play-
wright Euripedes had in‘ mind
was his own son,” he explained.

“Scholars now believe that in
the original version, Artemis her-
self _appeared to Clymnestra to
tell her of her daughter’s miracu-

lous removal to another land.

Best With His Hands

By LARRY BERNFIELD
Professor Charles Bell did his best speaking at the key-
board. Before he began the musical aspect of the PM pro-

gram last Thursday evening, he managed to convey that it“; ‘-

is ridiculous to speak of Jezz in general.
“When a Jazz musician gets a hold of a piece, he changes
it.” The Professor then’ proceeded to do so. Some musicians

add

brighten a chord. Bell changes
the chord all together.

Sitting at_ the keyboard, Bell,
joined by drummer Bill Harris
and Bass player Tommy Sewell,
conveled his short verbal message
to the audience through demon-
stration.

Their Blues arrangement of
“Prancing” developed -the straight
theme through a series of altered
chords—chi'oinatic progressions in
the bass- moving upwards by half
steps.

The trio's [version of Bobby
Timmon’s ‘fMoanin’ ” once more
showed simplicity in the melody
line as Bell doesn’t double many
ofthe melody notes in the Tim-
mons style. Once more, Bell
altered the chords ’ and used
chromatic progressions. This

A New Theory in’ Men’; Housing

* ‘Towers Ultra-Modern
Fully Equiped Dorms’ '

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN

Home-sweet-home, brotherhood,

togetherness, team

spirit — the Towers have opened the door to a new theory
in men’s housing on this campusnever possible before, ac-

4

cording to Peter Bijur,'president of Men’s Dorm Council.

Men of the University are offered the unique opportunity
of living in the most ultra-modern, fully equipped dorms any-

where in the country,” stated Bi-6

jur, “This only happens in one
generation of students. They
should be prepared to take full
advantage of all opportunities that
the towers can offer to them."

The University will try to in-
stitute a house system with each
house consisting of three floors,
through the use of the towers.
According to.Bijur, this is a new
theory at the University in men’s
resident living.

' Spirit Generated’

“It is hoped that through this’

system more spirit will be gen-
erated educationally and socially,”
said Bijur. “Each house should
‘hold its own educational and so-

cial programs and participate as-a '

unit in intramural athletics. In

keeping with these aims, the Men’s

Resident Hall Council will help

plan and coordinate these activi-

ties.

“In addition, beginning this
— year, the council will present,
' at the end of the year, a‘ Best
Living Unit Award. The award
will be based upon the number
of educational and social events
held’ by a house and upon the
number of intramural games a
house wins. The award will be
in the form of a plaque that
will remain in the most active

house.”

The group spirit needed to win
this award will not have to be
generated each year by different
groups of men. The continuity of
feeling of returning home each
September, is insured by the
theory behind the house system.
According to Bijur, :students
should live in the same house from
.year to year. .

Didn’t Work Before
' “Many of theiactivities which I

have mentioned,” commented Bi- '

jur, “have been tried before with-
ing our men’s dorms, but since
men’s resident halls were scatter-
ed around the campus rather than
being centrally located as they are
now we were not able to put them
into eﬁect.” E
A key organization in keeping .
the towers running smoothly
and to the satisfaction of the
men living inthem isithe Men’s
Dorm Council. The council will
begin to operate on a full time
basis after the election of its
representatives tonight.
“It is not only our intention
’ to plan social and educational
events,” indicated Bijur, “but to
present the physical problems of
the dorms to auxiliary enter-_
prises. There will be a committee
from the dorm council which will
deal solely with ‘receiving com-
plaints from any dorm student
about such things as what ,would

Council Wednesday, 9:30

ancho, AWS _chairman, “the
purpose of the Activities

various campus _ organiza-
tions."

Included in the represen-
tation will be 31 organiza-
tions, among. them, Student
Government, various reli‘-
gious groups, AWS and MC,
publications, Quo Vadis, and
military organizations. '

Members in Each Booth

“there will be members of
each organization to answer

Evancho explained. There
will also be an opportunity
to sign up to work for these

Meredith
Students’

In informal tete-a-tete featuring remarks made by James
Meredith to questions posed by University students revealed:

Q: What was your primary purpose in attending the
University of Mississippi——educationa1 or otherwise?

A: Of ‘course, I attended with an educational purpose in
mind. But I was, and have been, always mindful of the fact

Answers

  
    
 

Queries

dividual rights as a citizen.
Were Profs Antagonistic?
Q: Were professors at the Uni-
versity of Mississippi antagonistic
to you‘?
A. No. In the teaching profes-
sion, I believe, it is far more
important to stand well in the
‘eyes of your peers than to give
way to what people think
around you. ‘ -
Q. Do you feel America is
aware of the damage being done
on the international scene by re-
lations in the South?

A: In not only this country —-
but the world, human equality
is of prime importance and is
certainly essential to America be-
ing number one in the world."

Q. Would you expound further
on the ‘James Meredith. Educa-

_ tional Fund?

Question Posed

A. The question which con-
fronted me long before’ I ﬁnished
at the University of Mississippi
was - “what will I do with my
time -when I graduate? I felt the
best thing to do was to help’ other
underprivileged Americ ans -
members of my race — in every
way possible to get ﬁnancial as-
sista-nce neeeded for educational
training.

Q. Do you believe signiﬁcant
progress can be had in human
relations without a change in
social and political power struc-
tures?

A_: Basically no. The reality of
society is that the political struc-
ture is supreme. Therefore, un-
less it is politically decided a
person will be given the rights,
we won’t have a change.

Q: Do you think denial of ﬁrst-
class citizenship to Negroes will

result in an increase of Black
Muslim or Communist move-
ments?

,A: Communism has no appeal
to Negro masses. Black Muslims
are simply an. outgrowth of the
problems we have.

A Democratic Vote?

Q. The Negro vote has been
identiﬁed with the Democratic
party. What about the Negro vote
in the future?

A. The Negro will have a"
problem when he gets to vote in
the -South, for in actuality the
Democrats and Southern Demo-
crats are two diiferent parties.

Q: Which of the two methods of
gaining equal rights — demon-
strations or education — do you
favor and why?

A. I think we have lost the

lntermarriage: I . .. .

 

By Matthew Swetonic .

Long before the coming of -the Christ, the Jews, as the- fore-
fathersof Christianity, concluded that for the safety of the state
and, for the retention of the culture without blemish,_ it would be

desirable to restrict marriage in the society to those of the same

ethnic background. And to give this decision the authority necessary ~

to make it acceptable to the people, they incorporated it into their
book of laws, The Old Testament.- - 4 i
In a faith where religion is so much a part of the culture as in
Judaism, it is often -difficult to distinguish between the two, and
thus when the arrival of the Christ caused a split in the religion

, of the chosen people, this failure to perceive the difference between

whatlis social or cultural and what is religious carried over to a
large extent into the new Christianity. 1  ‘

4 And"when Christianity split into_ Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and
finally Protestantism, it was only natural that they should follow

..the old cultural belief that inter-faith marriage was a religious

‘problem. ‘Couple this with the eternal belief in the superiority of
one’s own religion and youare faced with a wall of opposition to
mixed marriage completely out of proportion to its religious worth.

How far this cultural conception has inﬂuenced us can only be
established by looking at the ideas held sacred by a large proportion
of American society. A i . ‘

In the Catholic religion it is believed that marriage outside -the
Church will result in the paganism of the children and in a complete
loss‘ of faith on the part ‘of the offending party. To combat this
situation, a Catholic is ~required under pain of excpmmunication
to‘. have his intended spouse sign his or her children over to the
Church for their education in the faith.

In Protestantism the restrictions are much less stringent — in
the case of Protestant‘ marrying Protestant — but whenit comes to
an intended marriage‘ between a Protestant and a Catholic or a
Jew, all eifortsvare made to discourage such a match. The arguments
used are generallyvthe same as in the Catholic faith-

In Judaism the question is admittedly more social and cultural
than religious. Modern Jews in -this country are more concerned
‘with a possible rejection of cultural ties than they arewith a loss

offaith. And for this reason, the Jewish outlook is the most realistic .

of the three for it takes the problem right back to its cultural roots.
However, it is for exactly this reason that marriage outside the

faith is so "difficult and so infrequent, because it is based upon cul-

tural and social concepts which are irreconcilable with the pseudo-

- religious overtones ‘found in the laws against intermarriage estab-

lished- by other religions.

The problem of inter-faith marriage is thus cultural and social

in origin but has successfully been twisted into a religious one.
Next -week, in the second part of this three part series on inter-
marriage, I shall look into the situation existing in the colleges of

the Republic and show how higher education is doing its part to =

change the old ideas on marriage.-

How Do You Plead, White’ Man? . . ’.

No’rCuilty 

 

C

To all of your charges, Mr. Meredith, I plead
Not Guilty.
First, I am not a mule that has to be smack-

‘ ed on the side of the head with a knotty limb, and

I resent the implications of your little anecdote.

‘Second, I completely disa-
vow your accusation that I am
to blame for the f‘crisis in race
relations.”_ I feel no responsi-
bility for conditions as they
now stand. I regret them and I
would, as much as. you, believe
it or not, like to see those con-
ditions change. History has
been unkind to the Negro, as
it has been unkind to many
minority groups, including , my
own, but I feel none of the
shame or guilt that you would have we feel
simply because I am -white’. I, refuse to be the
scape goat of history. And, as you believe that
second-class citizenship should not be an adjunct
to dark skin, so I believe-that shame or guilt
shouldinot be an adjunct to white skin.
By Choice '

.I have done everything -that I can do as an
indiivdual’ to make this society as free and open
to myself as well as to any of my ,associates. I
have worked with you, gone to school with you,
I have lived in the same neighborhood as you, I
have roomed with you, and I. have discussed with
you things in my personal life that I’ have never
discussed with any white. And I havedone these
things with the same indifference as ,w_hen I light"
a cigarette. I have not done them with the feeling

that I owe it to you to be respectable and de—,‘"

‘cent. I. have not done them beli.evi_ng that it’ was
my duty as an American. I have not.done them

 

By Stan Stein

perfunctorily and I have not condescended to do
them. I have done them by choice. You owe me
nothing, and you will not browbeat me into be-
lieving that I owe you anything.

Blame the Wallaces, Mr. Meredith, and the
Barnetts and the Faubuses. Don’t blame meand
don’t blame the American system. If it weren’t for
_a prejudiced minority the system would work. It
is the best system that man has yet devised, and
it is ultimately the fairest. Hate, fear and preju-
dice are human elements, they are not inherent
in the system.

Courage Built on Disdain -

What you have done and what you are doing
takes a great amount of courage, but your ten-
dency to _look down upon all those who wish
most to help you, even your own kind’ (“Burr-
heads” was the term you used), may eventually
defeat you. Perhaps you felt that you had a right

to look down upon. your own. You have proved.
that a poor farm boy from Mississippi, who had '

to haul fuel wood on a donkey cart in the rain,
can raise himself to be anything he wants to be.
You have also laid part ofthe blame yourself.
You stated that there are today only four Negro
lawyers in Mississippi. Why are there only four?
One poor farm boy chose to study law, why not
others?. ' ‘
There are many white people who want to

— help the Negro obtain his first class citizenship.

You must give them credit. You received the
largest ovationithat anyone has ever received at
a Midday Series lecture when you entered. But

,_ for the fact that most of the audience did not

know when they were being insulted, you would

A have been booed when you left;

“-I cried because I had no shoes,” Mr. Meredith,

\

“until I met ‘a man who had no feet.”

    LETTERS, TOITHEC Eonon     

-made by a strong-voiced

 News

. Co-ecl, Decries
Bernfield Column

. To the Editor:

Mr. Bernfeld, do you really
believe that the caliber of stu-
dent’ this University seeks to
attract will give up three or
four years? of Paradise in.Pitts-
burgh as a result of “the noises
mi-
nority”?' ‘_ ~ '

You obviously believe that
this’ minority is stronger than
the University’s overwhelmingly
impressive and loudly pro-
claimed expansion and develop-
ment program. Which voice do
you hear in The Pittsburgh
Press, The Po‘st-Gazette, out—of-

town newspapers and even- the-

Saturday Evening Post —- a
national magizine? *

What also seems obvious to
you, but not’ to me, are the
causes for complaint. A man so
quick to judge should also be.
quick to think before do-ing so.
Since you indicate that you have
done some investigating in the
tricky area of human nature you
surely .must have discovered
that seemingly trivial complaints
are sometimes based upon more

‘substantial and subtle ‘origin. I

believe it a little irresponsible
of you to substantiate your views
with ﬂimsy examples of the so-‘
called “anti—Pitt.” One .ar.ea of
criticism does‘ not prove any-
one “anti-everything.”

“The uninitiated, however,
should not too quickly involve
himself in” Bernfeld’s' .'over-
eagerness to tell him what‘is
and what is not a desirable ac-
ademic atmosphere. What is’ the
Poor-Innocent to think when he
sees," not hears, that": he cannot
park his car without strong risk
of being ﬁned; that he cannot
secure room, board and a class

schedule, let alone food which

he has already paid for,‘ with-
out great harrassment; and, bet-
ter yet, that a ﬁnancial cut-for
his — not their —.creative cul-

tural‘ and social”, thus “educa-
tional’’_ ‘(not to be confused with
“academic”) outlets have prac-
tically forced him into mobility.

Where," Mr. Bernfeld, ‘do you_
int'end“to foster this “quiet
school _pride"’,? ‘Your proposed
committee system is benevolent,“

. ‘but orientation only lasts a few

days and school lasts ‘for three

‘or four years (hopefully). ‘An

orientation committee "can cer-

tainly" be I beneﬁcial. in "pointing
-out ‘positive aspects but it can-

not convince anyone that black
is white.

School pride originates in
those previously crippled,‘ now
completely disabled things called
student organizations. And stu-
dent apathy originates in the
lack of freedom to develop, or,
to use. a popular word, “ex-
pand,”- student orginizations. If
you provide a half—heartedly or-
ganized activity. you can be sure
of a half-hearted response. Or
to use another. popular word -
apathy. -

It seems, then, Mr. .Bernfeld,
that you are guilty of the irra-
tional .con_demnation which you
attribute to the accused. I Think
that Martha Holstein (in the ar-
ticle onslashed "ﬁnancial aid in
the Pitt News of September 9)
unknowingly sp oke for the
whole student body when she
stated “We have resigned our-
selves to maneuvering as, well
as possible within a framework
we cannot control.’’_ 7

The University offers us of-
ﬁce space for student groups,
but no student groups. Let the
University speak for itself!

Student Appalled
By Greek Bias I

To‘ the Editor:
I was appalled by the column
written by Josey Grossman in

 

Pitt News about discrimination

among the ‘Greeks. Her argu- '
-ment that each of us chooses‘ our '

"friends in a discriminating man-
ner is an old and good one. She
didn’t appear, to think about
what qualities we base our

“°discri'mination” on, however.

People‘ can have many opin-
ions and enjoy the same -sports,
etc., regardless of religion, race
and nationality. Or. has Miss
Grossman never had a close
friend of another religion,’ race
or nationality? i Anyone who
hasn’t is missing something and
ought to try it. I know" it is
possible; As far as I’m con-
cerned, her column is based on
a fallacy, as is the discrimina-
tory practice among the Greeks.

I realize that these organiza-
tions also reject many appli-
cants of their own religion, race
and nationality; but this is no_
argument, for they reject every-
one of other religions, races and

nationalities. And most of them -

give no particular reason for it
all. “It’s always best that way”
is enough. __ 4 V
_ There’s deﬁnitely a lack of
thought, though it’s hard tosee
where blame is. I resent this
kind of practice, without even
the dignity of a good reason. ‘

- THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR owN

Colleges are complicated and bewildering places, ﬁlledjwith
complicated and bewildering people. Today let us examine
one of the most complicated and bewildering——-yet fetching and
lovable—of all campus ﬁgures. I refer, of course, to the dean
of students. -
Policeman and confessor, shepherd and seer, warden and
oracle,-proconsul and pal—the dean of students is all of these.
How, then, can we understand him? Well sir, perhaps the best

A way is to take an average day in the life of an average dean. _
Here, for example, is what happened last Thursday to Dean ‘

Killjoy N._ Damper of the Duluth College of Belles Lettres
and Pemmican. ‘ * "

At 6 a.m. he woke",/dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up on
the roof of his house to remove the statueof the Founder
which had been placed there during the night by high-

spirited undergraduates.

   

pus. (The Dean had not been driving his car since it had been
placed on the roof of the girls dormitory by high—spirited
undergraduates.) '

At 7:45 a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a. Marlboro and - -

climbed the bell tower to remove his secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.‘
At 8 a.m. he reached his oﬂice, lit a Marlboro, and met with

 Pluribus Ewbank, editor of the student newspaper. Young

Ewbank had been writing a series of _ editorials urging the
United States to annex Canada. When the editorials had
evoked no response, he had taken matters into his own hands.
Accompanied by his society editor and two proofreaders, he
had gone over the border and conquered Manitoba. With great
patience and several Marlboro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Ewbank to give Manitoba back. Young Ewbank, how-_
ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg.“ .
At 9 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with Robert
PennvSigafoos, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who’
came to report that the Deke house ‘had been put on top of
the Sigma Chi house during the night by high-spirited under? I
graduates.‘ ' -
At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire
an intramural softball game on the roof of -the~law school‘
where the campus baseball diamond had been placed during
the night by high-spirited undergraduates. ' '
v At 12 noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the
prexy, the bursar, and the registrar, at the bottom of the cam-
-pus swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been
placed during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.

Marlboros were passed afterluncheon, but not lighted, owing ‘

to dampness.

At 2 -p.m., back in his office, the Dean lit 3.. Marlboro and
received the Canadian Minister of War who said unless young
Ewbank gave back Winnipeg, the Canadian army would march
against the U.S. immediately. Young Ewbank was summoned
and agreedto give back Winnipeg if he could have Moose Jaw.
The Canadian Minister of War at first refused, but ﬁnally cou- "
sented after young Ewbank placed him on the roof of the
metallurgy building. _

At 3 p.m. the Dean lit-a. Marlboro and met with'a delega-
tion from the student council who came to present him with -
a setof matched luggage in honor of his ﬁfty years’ service as
dean of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage with
all his clothing and ﬂed to Utica, New York, where he is now —

Approximately 50 students greeted the football team’s

were joyously chanting “Hail To Pitt” and applauding the

have felt a little sad. After all they missed it. And it was a

The performance was not unnoticed by UCLA.coach Bill
Barnes. He said, “Pitt’s a real ﬁne team. One of the best in-

the United States. And what- speed they have. That (Paul)
Martha and (Eric) Crabtree can really fly.”

There was at different atmosphere in the Panther
locker room. The team played well and they knew it. t _

Ernie Hefferle beamed with pride over the play of his
ends. Labeled at mediocore for two years, the ends came
into their own against the Bruins. “We really put the heat on
them," Hefferle said. “When you rush that passer like we did
he’s bound to have a bad day.” UCLA completed only four

of 19 passes. “Bill Howley really put the heat on them,”

Hefferle continued.

Howley did more than play defense; He put credance
into the belief that he is the Panther’s best receiver by snar-
ing three passes for .59 yards. More importantl-lowley showed
that he has the ability to get loose; and attribute that has
been missing too long from the Panther passing attack.

Offense Rolls as Defense Smears

Bruins in Impressive First Game

By BOB SMIZIK

LOS ANGELES —— A superb overall defense, tremendous offensive line play, sharp

passing and flashy running were displayed by Pitt in bewildering UCLA, 20-0, Friday night.

Sophomore ‘Aldo Zortea Scores for Panthers;
Pete Milich Tallies Four Times for Winners

. . By ramp MARCUS
Lineman Pete Milich tapped in four goals as Akron out-

classed the Panther soccer team, 6-1, before a crowd of 450
that grew to about 13,000 before the end of the game at
Akron. The‘ soccer contest was a prelude to the Akron-Musk-
ingum football game.

“The diﬁerence in the game,” said Panther co-captain
Torn Staab “was the two boys
they had- from Africa’ —— one a
center forward and one a half-
back. It was unbelievable how
tough they were.

more remarkable.

The ﬁne performance of all the backs was helped by

outstanding offensive blocking.

Can the Panthers play this well the _rest of the sea-
-son? One important factor they have going for them is
conﬁdence. “We have a good team,” said captain Al
Grigaliunas with the matter-of-factness of Ralph Houk.

Paul Martha said,

“We knew we had the ﬁrst unit, and

now we showed that our second team can move the

ball too." .

On the basis of Friday’s showing they were right. How-
ever stronger teams than UCLA will have to be faced
before the ﬁnal verdict on this Panther team will be in. The
opening testimony, though, was very favorable. .

Thinclads W/hip Slippery Rock;

By WAYNE HANSON

_SLIPPERY ROCK, Pa. -—
The Panther cross-country
team opened the 1963 season

defeating Slippery Rock, 27-

As ‘head coach Carl Rees had
predicted th e Panther victory
was made possible by the ability
of his fourth and ﬁfth men to

place higher than those of the
opposition. Of the ﬁrst eleven
places the Rockets were only able
to take ﬁrst, third and ﬁfth.

Jim Waldorf of Slippery Rock
won the four mile race in a time
of‘22:57. Bill. Lucas of Slippery
Rock, placed third, behind Pitt's

John Bailey. '1' he only other

  Bailey Paces Squad to Victory

Rocket to place was Tom Grande
who was ﬁfth.

Make Fast Start
Making a fast .start, the Rock-
ets were able to move into .a
commanding position through the
ﬁrst mile. However, in the sec-
ond mile the Panthers moved up,
and too the lead which they
were able to maintain. Accord-
ing to Pitt's Bill Mocnik, “We
beat them on the hills”.
Bailey a n d Danien Koch
lead the Panthers efforts by _
placing second and fourth re- 0
spectively. Bailey. leading in
the second mile, was unable
to hold this position against
the well conditioned Waldorf.
Assistant coach Jim Banner
said, “The team performed well,
andshould do even better as the
season progresses." , t ' =

       
 

“‘Our team looked good," he
said, “but we made about four or
ﬁve mistakes and they hurt us.”
Staab felt that inexperience on
the part of the goalies and full-
backs accounted for four goals.
“Our big weakness," Staab said,

“was that we were losing all the V

plays at midﬁeld.”

Fast Fullbacks
Staab felt that the Akron full-
backs were as fast or faster than
Panther offensive men and that
Akron had a strong bench.
Center forward Aldo Zortea
put in the lone Panther goal on
a rebound off the goalie after
a shot _ by outside left Dave
Reichenbach. Zortea and Staab.
both feel the loss has “made the
team aware of how things are
and as a result the team is going
to be out to play harder.”
Zortea said, “I don’t feel like
taking any team too easy after the
Akron game. You’ll see a different
team Wednesday when we play
Frostburg. We'll have to be a dif-
ferent spirit."

 

Aldo Zortea

Staab” felt the score was “really
no indication of how .we played.
We weren’t really that bad.
-Somehow, everything seemed to
go wrong Saturday.”

Zortea mentioned that the
longest goal scored by Akron
was from about four- yards out.
This was the third win in the
series for Akron as opposed to
three for the Panthers. «
If enough experience was gain-
ed, it should show against Frost-

. burg at Forbes Field Wednesday

at 3:30 p.m. Coach Leo Bemis is
still trying to ﬁnd the right com.-
bination of players and could pos-
sibly do so Wednesday with the

Sage Smizik Holds Early Yogi. Lead;
Phathead Swetonic Tied for Second

Bob “Sage” Smizik, out to re-
gain the Yogi championship he
lost to Jim “Juggernaut” O’Brien
last year, took the early lead in
the Yogi running with a 13-2 rec-
ord last w e ek. “Juggernaut"
slipped to a 10-5 mark and is
in last place, along with Marvin
“Isaih” Zelkowitz. c

Big surprise of the week was

the showing of Matt “Phathead”

Swetonic, who ﬁnished second
with a 12-3 record. “Phathead”
has sworn to beat out Smizik.
Tied for second with Swetonic
are the player, picked by Paul
Martha, and the "female. The
coach, Ernie Hefferle, was one
game behind with an 11-40 mark.
Martha was the only Yogi to
pick the Air Force upset over
Washington. .

Hefferle, an offensive coach,
summed up. the victory by say-
ing, “The defense was the out-
standing part of our game.” You
can’t lose if the other team doesn't
score.

_Hefferle said, “It was different
from last year. We gave the kids

three or four defenses to learn
and they executed them perfectly.
The big difference between this
year and last year was the kids
knew what they were doing. It
looked like a different ball club."
This was the understatement of
HeIferle’s life..

. Move Ball Easily, _
While the defense held the
Bruins in check the offense had
an easy ‘time moving the ball
against the lighter Californians.

Pitt scored ﬁrst in the first
quarter on a 48-yard drive led
._by quarterback Fred Mazurek
and halfback Paul Martha. Ma-
zurek passed to Martha for 10
and 17-yards‘ and ran for 13-
yards on a quarterback sneak.
Martha took it over from four
yards out.

The next time the Panthers
got the ball they moved 77—yards
to the UCLA 3 where Mazurek
threw perfectly to Steve Butler.
-Butler, a 220-pound UCLA tackle,
rambled to the Pitt 11 where
Martha brought him down on the
defensive play of the game. The
Panther halfback had to cut di-
agonallyl across the ﬁeld to catch
up with Butler and then avoided
a blocker to make the tackle.

Real Big Play

Coach John Michelosen called
this “a real big play and, perhaps
the turning point in the game."
He said, “If they had scored it
could have changed the complex...
ion of the game. As it was we held
them to two yards in four downs
and this sort of killed them."

Rick Leeson did the rest of
the Panther scoring with ﬁeld
goals of 31 and 27 yards and a
one-yard touchdown plunge. He
also kicked two extra points. -

Martha was named back of the,
game but it could have gone to
a host of Panther backs. Bill Bodle
proved Mazurek’s favorite receiv-
er by snaring four passes. Eric
Crabtree lived up to his advanced
billings by averaging 5.5 yard per
carry. UCLA coach Bill Barnes
caled him the most dangerous run-
ner on the ﬁeld.

back position was in good hands
by completing eight of eleven.
passes and leading the team in
rushing with 49 yards for better
than -a six yard average. Kenny
Lucas’ and Fran Novak looked
good ‘in backing up Mazurek.

It was a near-perfect night for
the Panthers. Washington will be
hard pressed to stop a repeat per-
formance Saturday at the Stadi-
um.

  “Connecticut Kicker’
Boasts Winning Ways

- By FRED MARCUS -

Soccer halfback Jay Sprecher, who has been a mem-
ber of a winning team since his early high» school days,
expects to. continue that tradition with this year’s Pan-
ther squad. , .

Soccer was the big sport at Nathan Hale-Ray High
Schoolin East Hadden, Connecticut and Sprecher turn-
ed his athletic abilities in that direction. He was a start-
ing halfback in his sophomore year.

{Improve/i Yourself 6

Heplayed on the Connecticut state small high school ' — WITH A * -
championship team in his senior year, and at Mitchell ' '
Junior college last year Sprecher was instrumental in % DUNT
leading that team to the Junior College Championship. ' p 0 _

_ V Deﬁnite Ideas \ , ‘ V T
As to what constitutes aVgood halfback, Sprecher ""' ON ——

feels he “should be able to handle the ball Well, to keep
it low for shots, to pass accurately, and to play a good,
tight defensive games as well as help-out onoifense.”

4 “The hardest play for a.halfback,” he said, “is,
after supporting the line on an offensive attempt, to
get back to his penalty area if the other team starts
a fast break. ; ~

g “The fullback,” he said, “has to be real sure-footed—
he doesn’t bobble a kick in the penalty area——‘has to be
really sure of himself, has to stop the man with the ball,
and should have the ability to get theloose ball.”-

He feels that the Panthers have “a real good--team
with a lot of all-around ability. We have a lot of po-

tential to go a long way,” he said, “and from what I

know of the way the guys feel, We ‘can go all the way.”
