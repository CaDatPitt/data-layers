Reagan’s luck
called ‘uncanny’

By Samuel Thompson
The Pitt News

Emery King, the NBC White
House correspondent, speaking in
the multi-purpose room ofthe union
last night, said that the secret of
Ronald Reagan's success is that he
“delivers a speech ﬂawlessly” and is
able to “bypass congress and go
directly to the people and get a
response.” .

King told the full house that Rea-
gan also has an “uncanny knack for
generating luck." He reviewed the
ups and downs of the last few
months of the Reagan Administra-
tion and concluded that despite the
cold that disrupted the inaugural
festivities, the president “didn't feel
too much of a chill.” "

He also commented on the
exchange of jobs between Donald
Regan, who has just become White
House chief of staff, and James
Baker, now Treasury Secretary. He
called Regan a man used to power
and commente‘d, “He certainly will
find power as chief ofstaff," because
in, the White House, “access” is
power." .

/On his days as a writer for televi-
sion, King commented, “I was
appalled at the length of time given

to stories of national import.” His
first story dealt with the Iranian

_embassy, which according to him

was “sexy" because it had “demon-
stration, public interest and vio-
lence.” His producer was very ‘
enthusiastic and gave him—a minute
and 20._seconds of air time, a good bit
for television. “I had to learn to con-
dense my writing,” said King, “to be
objective and give only the most
important facts.” And, King claims
his writing is still “much too wordy
— it remains a problem today."
About hisjob, King said it means
working in a “pressure-packed -
atmosphere” where “anything can
happen at any time.” He called the

A conditions under which he works

deplorable and told of the White
House press box, which he shares
with five other members of the NBC‘
White House staff. “It is constantly
drummed into you that [President
Reagan] is the most important man
in the world.” King’s major com-
plaint was that most ofthe informa-
tion a White House correspondent
receives is second- andthird-hand.
King criticized President "Reagan
foi his inability to understand black
America and compared a “photo
opportunity" (a closed press confer-
ence) featuring James Brown as a
representative of blacks to “inviting
Conway Twitty as a representative
of white America.” ‘

Although Benyukh praised the
recent meeting between U.S. Secre-

‘tary of State George Schultz and

Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko and said he was optimistic
about the coming “nuclear arms cur-
tailment talks,” he felt that more
should bedone.

Benyukh, who spoke on Wednes-
day to the World Affairs Council, is
also the editor-in-chief of'Soviet
Life, a magazine published for
American readers.

“We in the Soviet Union would
prefer them [arms talks] to be brief,
useful and to result in the total elimi-
nation of nuclear weapons for all
time,” stated Oleg P. Benyukh,
counselor for information of the
Soviet embassy in Washington,
D.C.

He said that U.S.-Soviet relations

Heart

Shirley Haberman, of the Student Health Service,
quand Dr. William Neches, a professor of pediatrics,
discuss the issues of heart disease.

Talks between the two countries
should encompass everything from
arms control toithe exchange of
medical technology.

The lack of cultural exchange is
also unfortunate. The U.S. is denied
the Bolshoi ballet and the U.S.S.R.
is denied the -Boston Symphony..
“Both sides are losing,” he said.

Benyukh said that the biggest
obstacle'to better relationsbetween
the two countries is misinformation.
“Lack of knowledge,”he said, “leads
to misunderstanding. Misunder-
standing leads to animosity, and
animosity might lead to something
catastrophic.”

Benyukh said it is more important
to find what the U.S. and the“
U.S.S.R. have in common. He men-

-tioned the coming 40th anniversary

of the end of World War 11.

“This year on May 9, we will cele-
brate on a grand scale the victory
over Fascism," he said. “In that war,
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. were
allies. When our troops met at the
Elbe, both countries and the whole

world rejoiced.

“We want peace," he concluded.
“We want cooperation on mutually
agreeable terms.”

Benyukh said that trade between

‘the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. is insignif-

icant. “We buy grain and you'buy
vodka,” he said “That’s how it

‘ stands. In this case, we aren’t losing _

as much as you are.”

He pointed out that the U.S. loses
by denying trade to the Soviet Union
since any gap in trade is eagerly filled
by Japan. and West Germany.

The myth that the U.S.S.R. is a
“technologically backward”country
has been instilled in people's minds.
Americans believe that people in the
Soviet Union “wear wooden boots,
embracing bears while drinking
vodka and eating caviar with big
spoons.” _

Benyukh asked, “Would a back-
ward country have put the first man
in outer space?” He commented that
the Soviet people know more about

the U.S.. than Americans know

In a vote of 6-2 with one absten-
tion, the Student Government
Board rejected a motion presented
by the Allocations Committee, to

_ refuse total funding ofa programto

a student organization in the board_’s
meeting on Wednesday.
. The Commuter Association had
requested funding for a question-
naire that would be conducted by
mail. The association asked for
$2,500 to cover the cost of 8,000
questionnaires, cover lettgrs, com-
puter answer sheets and \return
postage. "

The Allocations Committee
decided that the mailing of the ques-
tionnaire would not be cost-
efficient, according to chairman
John Benchoff. “The commuters
come on campus for school. so why
should we be sending out 8,000 piec-
es of mail?" he said. In addition, he
recommended to the board that the
questionnaires be put in “strategic
locations on campus" so the com-
muters could complete them while
on campus.

Commuter Association president
David Less strongly opposed this

recommendation. “This is our best
chance to get the commuters’ opin-
ions. We can send them all question-
naires. We hope to get 2,000 ofthem
back, which would really give us a
good idea of what they need," he
said. '

Board member Dan Taylor also
agreed with the association’s opin-
ion that mailing the questionnaires
would be more effective. “Commut-
ers represent a majority of the stu-
dents here at Pitt,” he said.
“Commuter apathy is a problem and
should be a major concern of this
board. These surveys offer us an
opportunity to assess the problem
and provide us with an informa-
tional base with which we can for-
mulate possible solutions.” The
board sent the association’s request
back to the Allocations Committee
to be re-evaluated.

During the meeting, the board
also ruled that the Academic Affairs
Committee be eliminated. A ques-
tion was raised as to whether the
board had violated their own bylaws
by terminating the committee now
instead of in April. SGB president
Luke Kluchko said that he had
checked with the Judicial Board and
the board’s decision would not be a
bylaw violation.

about the U.S.S.R. Thousands of
American books are published inthe
U.S.S.R. while the number of Soviet
books brought to the U.S. “could be
counted on one hand.”  i

As an example of this lack of

knowledge, he cited a film series.

about the Soviet Union that was
aired by PBS. The series of 20 one-
hour films, entitled “The Unknown
War,” depicted life in the U.S.S.R.
during World Wa_r II.

“This was an insult,” said
Benyukh, his anger evident. “In that
‘unknown war,’ we lost 20 million
people.”The U.S. lost only 400,000
men during the war -and yet PBS
only aired two to three hours of the
series. a

“That was a film about, our joint
struggle,” he continued._“That’s not
a misunderstanding. That’s some-
thing more.”

Benyukh ended his prepared
remarks by saying: “We will have
better relations in the future. I’m an
optimist.”

’ In the question-and—answer
period that followed, Benyukh was
asked whether or not religious sup-
pression in the U.S.S.R. had been
relaxed. He replied that it was a
myth that religious suppression
exists in the Soviet Union and that
the only religions restricted are those
that are “harmful to mankind.” He

admits\that the Russian Orthodox
Church is very big and powerful,
and cited the existence of Baptist

and Presbyterian churches as well.

A member of the audience
objected to Benyukh’s claim of reli-
gious freedom. He told Benyukh
that he was a Ukrainian descent and
said that the Ukrainian Orthodox
Church was absorbed by the Rus-
sian Orthodox Church in 1946 and
had its leaders jailed. . ,

“There was no absorption,”
Benyukh replied, “and you can take
my word on that. I also am Ukrain-
ian. I lived there; there was no
absorption."

Benyukh’s assertion that religious .
suppression in the U.S.S.R. was a
myth was challenged by another
member of the audience. He cited
the Soviet restriction of Jewish emi-
gratiorr and the lack of rabbinical
schools. In all of the U.S.S.R., he
said, there are only three rabbis.‘
There are no Hebrew. publications
and many rabbis have been jailed.

Benyukh covered his noticeably
reddened face with his hands and
breathed deeply. He said emigration
is difficult because there must be “an
before a person is allowed to emi-
grate. He claimed that thousands
who have already emigrated have
applied to return. The other points
were not addressed;

Heart disease:  

Prevention is the best cure

By Christopher L. Wells

‘ The Pitt News .1

“Heart disease is the No. 1 killer
among the population as a whole,”
said Shirley Haberman health edu-
cator for the university’s- Student
Health Service.

According to Haberman and the
American Heart Association, heart
disease ranks as the fifth leading
cause “of death for Americans.
Nearly 40 percent of all Americans
die of heart-related diseases. ‘

“The. kinds of lifestyle patterns,
health behaviors and our ability. to
modify stress, weight and diet can
change for our advantage,” Haber-
man saidi “What you establish in 20
years [what lifestyle and health
behavior] will determine what you
develop later on in life.” .

Dr. William Neches, professor of
pediatrics at Pitt and resident at
Children’s Hospital, agreed that our
lifestyle, has some bearing on what

will come up “later on in life.” As to,

the cause of heart disease, Neches
said smoking is a major inﬂuence,
and other major factors of health
disease include high intake ofanimal
fats and salt, physical and emotional
stress, and lack of exercise and a
balanced diet. A high intake_'of
animal fat can cause cholesterol

 

  
 

build up, leading to hardening of the
arteries, which can bring on a stroke.

“Exercise burns calories, main-
tains weight and relieves stress inthe
body,” Haberman said.

Both Haberman and oNeches
stated that high blood pressure is
linked to heart disease. Neither
could explain, however, why high
blood pressure is more common
among blacks than whites. “Statis-
tics don’t say that if you’re white,
you won’t get it,” Neches said. '

. He_stressed that published statis-
tics are of the American population
as a whole, and as of now doctors are
still trying to find out why the

- groups differ. Neches added, “There

are no symptoms of high blood pres-
sure, so have it checked regularly.”

As for stress related to heart dis-
ease, Neches said, “We arejust look-
ing into it right now, but as for the
moment, stress really doesn’t have
any significant contribution.” Both

‘Haberman and Neches said that g

heart disease risk increases as you
get older. Other factors such as fam-
ily history and environment also
have an (unmeasured) effect. “There
is no specific relationship between
individuals; heart disease differs
greatly among cultural groups,”
Neches said.

speaker seeks peace

In response to a question about
the arms race, Benyukh replied, “If
you look at the history of nuclear
weapons, you will see that we were
always the side that had to catch up
with you Americans.“

When asked about the Reagan
administration's allegations of
treaty violations by the Soviet
Union, Benyukh said, “We have
never violated any of our agree-
ments and we are not going to. In the
United Nations, we pledged no first
strike [nuclear weapons] and invited
all nations to do likewise. We’re still
waiting for the U.S. to do the same.”

When asked to comment on Presi-
dent Reagan’s “Evil Empire”
remark, Benyukh’ said, “Since your
president is.74 years old, I abstain.’

Speaking in Russian, a high
school girl asked why, when she
visited the Soviet Union, she could
not find books by several Russian
authors (among them the poet Boris
Pasternak) in the bookstores.

“lt’s too bad we didn't meet when
‘you were there. I would have taken
you to my library and shown you all
those books,” Benyukh replied.

In his concluding remarks,
Benyukh commented, “You . see,
even this brief talk shows so many
things divide us. It is high time for us
to take united action on one point —

peace, preserving peace. We live on ,

one beautiful planet. Let’s preserve
‘it and flourish.” ’

“Heredity plays a role, and may
‘increase the risk of heart disease,”
Haberman added.

Both ‘ Haberman and Neches
agreed that college students should
try to follow a healthplan to prevent
heart disease. They suggested that

"smoking especially should be
avoided, because the nicotine in
cigarettes increases heartrate, and
can in the long run put a strain on‘
the heart. Caffeine in coffee and soft
drinks also increases heart rate. Eat-
ing a balanced diet and maintaining
aproper weight also contributes to
heart disease prevention. Haberman
suggested that an aerobic exercise
program for both males and females
would be beneficial, as well as good
stress management. “Our big hope is
modifying [people’s] lifestyles,"
Haberinan said. “Development of
heart disease is a long, silent
process.”

According to the American Heart
Association, the symptoms of a per-
son having a heart attack or a stroke
are as follows: acute pain in center of
chest, neck, jaw or left side of arm,
shortness of breath, vomiting and
occasional loss of consciousness.
AHA has set up programs to teach
CPR, exercise and prevention
courses for this month -— which has
been designated as Heart Month.

Wecht talks malpractice

By Tess Warner
The Pitt News

There is a difficult balance
between a physician’s ethical and
moral obligations to his patient and
any possible legal ramifications con-
cerning medical malpractice,
according to Dr. Cyril H. Wecht,
Clinical Associate Professor of
Pathology at the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Malpractice cases are filed
because of substandard care and, as
Wecht explained, “the reasonable
person concept." He stated that one
cannot sue because his care was not
the “absolute best” but for “what
would have been expected from a
reasonably competent doctor.” He
added that in 98 percent of all mal-
practice cases, medical experts are
brought in to give testimony.

In the 1960s there were less than
5,000 cases of medical malpractice

brought to the courts annually.
Wecht said that there are now about
25,000 new cases annually. It is
important to note, he explained,
that less than 0.05 percent of‘ these
cases concern “kook doctors” that
have emotional, drug or drinking
problems.

The majority of the cases occur
when “someone just makes a mis-
take,” Wecht said. “They have their
minds on the sons who flunked out
of college or the ﬁght with their
wives, and in that instant they are
incompetent.” The patients, he
added, are not challenging the dedi-
cation or expertise of the doctors.

Wecht was also concerned about
how to handle a situation in which a
patient did not receive appropriate
care from his previous doctor and
was not advised of that situation by
his current physician. Wecht
pointed out that a doctor can be
named a malpractice co-defendant if
he does not inform the patient of
what occurred in his previous doc-

.tor’s care. There are also the legal

ramifications for remaining silent
until after the statute of limitations
expires.

Wecht listed some basic guide-
lines that he felt doctors should use
to handle such cases. First, secon-
dary doctors should refrain from
making snide or adverse comments
about the first doctor. This gives the
patient a very negative feeling
toward the first doctor. Instead, he
explained, the secondary doctor
should only give an “objective,

matter-of-fact transfer of
information.”
Wecht also pointed out that

added expenses are incurred because
of substandard care and the possibil-
ity ofa lowered mortality rate for the
patient. He added that this informa-
tion “should be shared and not kept
a secret."

In conclusion, Wecht suggested
that doctors “verbally tell the patient
or spouse the facts but don't say ‘Go
sue.‘ ”

Speaker says,S.E. Asian
countries arent dominoes

By Julie Bardek
The Pitt News

Dr. Joseph J. Zasloff, a professor
of political science, addressed the
issue of U.S. interests in southeast
Asia at a presentation Wednesday in
Forbes Quadrangle. The lecture was
presented by the Colloquium on
Security in an‘ Interdependent
World.

According to Zasloff, U.S. inter-
est in southeast Asia climaxed in
1975 when Vietnam fell to thé Com-
munists. At this time, the U.S.
believed strongly in the Domino
Theory: If one southeast Asian

The Brothers of

nation fell to communist rule, others
would follow suit. Zasloff said that
the United States’ assumptions
regarding the Domino Theory were
wrong; the balance of powers in
Souteast Asia has changed, he said,
not all governments have turned to
communism.

“Many nations of southeast Asi_a
have worked together to develop a
security concept called the Zone of
Peace and Freedom,” Zasloff said.
“These countries aspire to achieve
such a zone so that the region may be
free and independent from interfer-
ence by greater world powers and to
remain neutral
conflicts.”

Although continued U.S. pres-
ence is favored, the Zone is still a

lust and disrespect.

goal of the future which U.S. policy
supports. Zasloff has extensively
researched and written on southeast
Asian affairs over the past 20 years,
tracing both U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam conﬂict and the postwar
realities. He has recently concluded
a field research trip to Kampuchea
and Thailand.

“The contemporary role of the
U.S. in southeast Asia is one of sig-
nificant influence, and southeast
Asia is now a second-rate interest to
the U.S. American interests con-

tinue to be focused on security and -

fear of the growth of communism.
The U.S. also has a clear interest in
avoiding conflicts of power between
major nations,” Zasloff stated.

If God had wanted them to be angels, he would have given them wings.

5Faculty ass_em
proposes guidelines

By Dirk Kaufman
The Pitt News

The faculty assembly yester-
day approved a draft of guide-
lines for search committees for
senior academic officers. The
guidelines apply to the hiring
process used for academic deans,
provosts, senior vice presidents
and regional campus presidents.

Several faculty members
expressed concern that the
guidelines may not be followed
by the administration, since they
are not bound to do so. Professor
Wesley Rohrer Jr., president of
the University Senate, told the
assembly that “the administra-
tion has used the old version of
the guidelines with little diffi-
culty” and that there was no rea-
son to assume they would not do
the same in the future.

It was suggested, however,
that some official approval ofthe
guidelines be requested so that
the assembly could be assured of

compliance.

The guidelines will now be
given to the University Senate
for approval.

In other business, it was
announced that an open hearing
will be held on March #8 con-
cerning the final report by the
provost on the “University Plan:
I985-I990.” The hearing will be
held in room I228 ofthe Cathed-
ral of Learning from 3-5 p.m. All
students and faculty will be given
the opportunity to voice con-
cerns about the report by reserv-
ing time with the senate office.
They will be accepting reserva-
tions for five-minute spots until
March 16. Those who wish to
speak may also reserve time, if it
is available, on the day of the
hearing.

Also, President Rohrer
informed the assembly that Tho-
mas Detre, vice president of the
School of Health Sciences, has
announced that he will be accept-
ing nominations from medical
school faculty for the post of
dean of the medical school.

God Save America

Last night’s State of the Union Address was an inspir-
ing message, indeed. It was a message ﬁlled with hope and
optimism for the future, andfpride in America’s present
and past. It was more thanjust inspiring, though; it was a
plan for America’s future and anadmonishment to"Con-
gress to pass the president’s budget proposal.

Part of that budget is a dramatic increase in military
spending, coupled with a decrease in domestic spending
— an economic plan that deeply disturbs nearly every
member of Congress. ’ c .

Last night, however, criticism of the president’s plan
was nowhere to be heard. Military spending (acknowl-
edged wasteful spending on materials, ill-given govern-
ment contracts and other, more properly spent monies),
the president said, is no longera military/ industrial com,-
plex when the U.S. is threatened. “It becomes,” he said,
“the arsenal for democracy.” The president’s comment
was received with hearty applause. F"

We wonder for which democracy of the American
people, for it is not the common man but major U.S.
businesses who shall gain by an increase in military
spending. ‘

The president has not proven that the U.S. is threat-

ened. Yesterday morning, California Senator Alan Cran- .

ston said that the U.S. is “vastly superior to the Soviet
Union militarily, and certainly in other ways  We’re
free, and that’s why we’re strong.” According to National
Public Radio, most of Cranston’s colleagues agree. The
U.S. is apparently not threatened.

According to Reagan’s proposal, 29.5 percent of the
1985 federal budget will be allotted to military expenses.
By 1988, that figure is projected to rise to 35.2 percent.

Meanwhile, the U.S. is facing a $200 million+ federal
deficit on which 13.6 percent of the total, 1985 budget is
allocated to pay only the interest. Just only 7.35 percent
—— 6.3 percent less than the interest payment on the
national debt — is allocated for needs-based benefits,
such as aid to families with dependent children, social
welfare, the food stamp program, unemployment com-
pensation and student aid.

Unless the American people demand — and receive —
an end to such duplicity, there will be nothing in America
worth defending. ‘

Abortion

This letter is an open response to
the letter written by Robert Hooper
(“Free Choice,” Jan. 28). Your
apathy, Mr. Hooper, is characteris-

tic of society today. Ours is
assuredly the “who cares?”
generation.

I..et’s look at your “live and let
live" philosophy. You tell us that
with such a philosophy, “there is no
longer any need to distinguish when
life begins - whether it be at con-
ception, birth or anyplace in
between or after. Believe it begins
whenever you like.” This certainly
gives people —— parents especially -
a selfish, diabolical privilege: the
authority to take their child’s life at
virtually any stage in his
development.

Maybe right now is not a “conven-
ient” time for your parents to keep a
young son. Maybe it is causingtoo
much “emotional stress.” Perhaps
finances are too low. Whatever case.
the answer to all these problems is
simply to remove the source. Your
parents have complete authority to
murder you in your sleep.

Perhaps you feel you deserve
some defense. Maybe you believe
that you have come too far to have
your life snuffed out now. Who
wouldn’t feel the same? But as you
are being ripped apart by a force 72
times your own, do not attempt to
talk your murderer out of it. For the
sake of the live—and—let-live society,
“don’t try to force someone else to
believe what you believe."

in essence, the idea of “forcing”
someone to believe something is as
ridiculous as forcing someone to like
green beans. No matter how manyl
make you eat, your taste buds con-
tinue to reject their bitter sensation.
Any deviation from that must come
from within you. in like manner, no
one can ever force you to believe
anything that goes against your
heart.

In a society where fads and style
are the No. 1 concern, it is becoming
fashionable to kill babies. In every
instance, the murder is premedi-
tated. Each time, it is done with the
intent to do so. This is first-degree
murder. if you or I were to go out
and do this, we would probably be
sentenced to a lengthy prison term.

But doctors get paid to do this every
day. Pro-abortionist women are
making a mockery of this holocaust
by saying they have a right to their
own body. Their body - yes. Some-
one else’s, like their unborn child’s
—- no.

However, an exciting thing is hap-
pening today. People are starting to
stand up for what they believe. Even
you smile on that, Mr. Hooper. We

\ have to stand for something or we
will fall for anything. indifference"

makes all the difference.

I have been reading The Pitt News
for three years. Not once can I
remember a time when the classified
section did not contain at least two
pleas placed by couples looking to
adopt an “unwanted” infant. Surely
Pittsburgh is not the only place
where people place these ads. Even if
a woman does not want her baby,
someone else will take that responsi-
bility for her.

Mr. Hooper, you are able to read
this sentence today because a lady
decided some 20 years ago to have
her baby. What greater accomplish-
ment can any woman achieve? I’m
not trying to change your beliefs, but
I am asking you to give others the
opportunity to develop their own. If
you have ever cared for another
human being, then you know how
important a life is, regardless of the
age. Maybe the person on the inside
has the answers for those of us on the

Outside" Brian D. Abzanka

Jolly on Jersey

in his Feb. I article, Bob Travers \

mentioned that the area west of the
Hudson River in New Jersey
“should be condemned and declared
unfit for human life." He goes on to
say that he thinks “New Jersey” is
latin for “urban blight." —
Well, Mr. Travers, in some ways I
tend to agree with you. Being from
that area myself, I’m quite familiar
with the cities which you described
as unfit for human life. Quite often,
the Newark Star-Ledger has head-
lines of murders, rapes or muggings
which occurred in that area the night
before. ,But then again, the Pitts-
burgh Press and even The Pitt News
print headlines like that, too, don't
they? .
I know of many neighborhoods in
the “condemned ”area which are rec-
ognized as unsafe + you know,just
like South Oakland or the Hill Dis-
trict. There are even streets where
prostitutes can be found, streets sim-
ilar to Liberty Ave. Then there are
the North Jersey dumps; they give
the surrounding area a strong smell
of vomit,just like the steel mills give
Pittsburgh the sweet smell ofsulfur.

Letters t th Editor ’

The wet, rodent-infested marsh-
lands of the Meadowlands is in the
“condemned” area also, but con-
tained in the Meadows are the New
Jersey Meadowlands sports facili-
ties. In the opinion of this writer,
those facilities put Pittsburgh’s
sports facilities to shame — in size,
parking, cleanliness, beauty and
accessibility. ‘

As for New Jersey being an urban
blight, I think you made that state-
ment as you looked out of your air-
plane window and saw Port
Newark. Some people may consider
that statement ignorant, opinion-
ated and maybe even prejudicial but
I don’t really mind. In fact most Jer-
seyans won’t mind how you feel as
long as you and your fellow Pennsyl-
vania residents continue to spend
your vacation money ontour beaches
and in our casinos.

Finally, it is the opinion of this
writer that your Feb. I article had
very little to do with sports and did
not belong on the sports page.

Love Life

Wc’ve waited long enough! It’s
time the American people show their
love for life! After reading “War to
End All Life” (Feb. 4), I was
appalled that the Reagan Adminis-
tration. rejected the Soviets’ pro-
posed agreement of not being the
first to fire nuclear weapons. This
morning I heard in Reagan's budget
proposal that he wants to cut stu-
dent loans and medicare while
increasing defense spendings’ by 10
percent. I hope we realize that by not
publically voicing our disgust to this
absurdity, we are passively support-
ing Reagan and his decisions. If we
would join together and demon-
strate our feelings against Reagan's
decisions, we could show our respect
toward human — and all k life,
which Reagan seems to be lacking.
I'm going to do all I can to boil the
anger in people, and I beg you do the
same.

President‘ Posvar.

Carlow College U ndergraduate

Editor's Note: There was a fundamental error in the message
asking readers of The Pitt News to choose between “The Uni-
versity's Mission" of former Chancellor Litchfield and that of

The statement labeled as the “University Mission of Presi-
dent Posvar” was taken out of context in that perhaps it was
not intended by the president to be his mission for the univer-
sity. We regret that the president was never consulted to con-
firm what indeed is his mission for the university.

The poll, therefore, is invalid.

The Pitt News, Friday, February 8, 1985

Trying to Break Through/

Vicki Zeitner

Upon examining the university
plan to understand the institutional
reorganization facing Pitt and the
implications of those proposed
changes to its community, one
encounters many inconsistencies
among academic planning criteria
and departmental recommenda-
tions.

The academic planning criteria,
outlined and defined in the first sec-
tion of the plan, consist of five fac-
tors by which each school,
department and office of the univer-
sity were evaluated. These factors
are I) quality, 2) centrality, 3) stu-
dent demand, 4) cost and 5) compar-
ative advantage.

One would expect each office or
department to be judged according
to its ranking in relation to each of
these factors. Unfortunately, the
university plan wasneither efficient
nor complete.

Many schools or departments
that were recommended for a
decrease either in funding or in
faculty size were not efficiently eval-
uated with regard to quality, central-
ity or comparative advantage. Their
evaluations emphasized considera-
tions based either on cost or an exag-
gerated estimate of declining
enrollment. On the other hand,
schools or departments that were
recommended to receive an increase
in funding were thoroughly (perhaps
meticulously) judged according to
quality, consistently ranked in cen-
trality, and given little comment by
way of cost per student credit hour.

Departments facing a proposed
decrease in resources were discussed
in terms of declining enrollment
based on percentages, whereas can-
didates for an increase in resources
were discussed in terms of expected
increase in enrollment. The fact that
the departments were not evaluated
in a consistent manner indicates that
some serious biases underlie the
foundations of this report.

The Graduate School of Business,
for example, was ranked nationally
in the top 20 among programs of its
kind, has doubled its level of spon-
sored research to more than
$600,000 in the last five years and
has experienced a recent increase in
enrollment. Even though its affirma-
tive action record is questionable (it
has no minority tenure-stream
faculty) and its sponsored research
has doubled, the Graduate School of
Business is a candidate for a “modest
increase in funding.” Why?

A recommendation in the evalua-
tion ofthe University of Pittsburgh’s
Johnstown campus suggested that
the branch campus shape up its affir-
mative action record. Let the same
be suggested for the Graduate
School of Business.

A recommended increase in fund-
ing for the School of Engineering is
equally questionable — its quality
was deemed “uneven" and its
revenues exceed its costs. Much of
its research is sponsored by outside
sources. What becomes of the
school’s revenue?

A school that requires additional
funding despite its excess in
revenues (and we don't know by how
much, because it wasn’t stated) is too
costly to operate. It should develop a
plan to generate more revenue, be a
candidate for decreased funding or
be phased out completely.

Compare the evaluations of Pitt’s
professional schools. The School of
Dental Medicine was not evaluated
in the plan according to the aca-
demic planning criteria. No estima-
tion was given of its quality,
placement record, centrality, com-
parative advantage, student demand
or cost (which is likely to be quite
high). The school was briefly and
simply recommended to “develop a
plan to generate revenue," which
implies that their costs exceed their
revenues by a significant amount.
Again, no exact figures were
provided.

Likewise, the School of Nursing
was not evaluated on any of the aca-
demic planning criteria except cost.
Its direct costs also exceed its
revenues (and again, the amount is
not disclosed). The plan's recom-
mendation? Review the Ph.D.

A Look at the University 5

program.

Similarly, the School of Medicine
was evaluated only in terms of cen-
trality and cost, which noted that its
costs exceed its revenues signifi-
cantly. The School of Medicine was
briefly and simply recommended to
also “develop a plan to generate
more revenue.”

In the evaluation of the School of
Pharmacy, there was no mention of
its immaculate 100 percent place-
ment record, its centrality to the uni-
versity’s urban mission by serving
the interests of western Pennsylva-
nia, the level of student demand nor
its comparative advantage. We do
know, however, that its costs

exceeded its revenues by $900,000,
according to the plan.

This figure certainly appears
astonishing after the absent figures
of the Schools of Medicine, Nursing
and Dental Medicine. Any one of
those could beat out the School of
Pharmacy in terms of exceeding
costs, but we can’t be sure because
we were not given the facts. Unfortu-
nately, the School of Pharmacy was
not given the opportunity to
“develop a plan to generate more
revenue.” It was simply recom-
mended to “phase out."

Problems also exist in the plan’s
evaluation of departments in the
College of Arts and Sciences. The
natural sciences, specifically the

Year

Plan:

biology and chemistry departments,
were explicitly evaluated in terms of
quality. Most people are aware of
the exceptional quality of Pitt‘s
science departments and programs.
Both departments were said to have
high levels of sponsored research,
yet both are candidates for high
increases in funding. The biology
department has experienced a nearly
50-percent decrease in enrollment
over the last decade, though
“increases are expected in the
future.”

ls there any way to understand
why a department with significantly
high levels of sponsored research
requires increases in funding‘? Per-

1985-1990

haps, if one is given the facts.
Paradoxically, the physics and
astronomy department w which
ranks in the top quarter nationally,
has a high level of sponsored
research and has experienced an
increase in enrollment —- is recom-
mended for a decrease in funding.

The apparent inconsistencies go
on. There are even more unanswered
questions regarding the recommen-
dations to increase funding in the
majority of administrative offices of

the university. Hopefully, in the

final weeks of deliberations on the
recommendations made by the pro-
vost, these inconsistencies will be
addressed and alleviated.

(UPI) — Four Polish secret
policemen were sentenced to prison
yesterday for the kidnap and murder
of a dissident priest.

Turning a deaf ear to the prosecu-
tion‘s demand for the death penalty,
the judge ordered Captain Grzegorz
Piotrowski jailed for 25 years. The
prosecution had demanded that Pio-
trowski be hanged for mastermind-
ing the killing of Rev. Jerzy
Popieluszko.

Popieluszko, a strong supporter
of the outlawed solidarity union,
was kidnapped, beaten, gagged and
dumped in a reservoir last October.
His body was found 12 days later.

The official state news agency
(PAP) did not explain why thejudge
refused to order Piotrowski’s execu-
tion. However, the Roman Catholic
Church had earlier said it would
appeal any hanging order.

The judge also sentenced police
Col. Adam Pietruszka to 25 years
imprisonment for inciting the kil-
ling, and handed out prison terms of
15 years to Lt. Leszek Pekala and 14
years to Lt. Waldemar Chnielewski.

MOSCOW (UPI) — Once again,
questions have been raised about the
health of Soviet leader Konstantin

« Chernenko, although Moscow said

yesterday that he attended a meeting
of the ruling Politburo.

The state-run Tass news agency
quoted Chernenko as commenting
on preparations for the Soviet

spring planting during the meeting.
But thereare no pictures or video-
tape of Chernenko at the session.

A London newspaper, which last
year reported the death of Yuri
Andropov several hours before the
Kremlin announced it, now reports
that Chernenko recently suffered a
massive heart attack. The paper said
that doctors saved him.

Quoting what it calls “a source we
can rely on,” the Standard News-
paper said Chernenko is recovering
in the intensive care unit of a Mos-
cow hospital.

Tuesday, the editor-in-chief ofthe
Soviet Communist Party newspaper
Pravda admitted that the 73-year-
old Chernenko is ill. but he said he is
still performing his duties.

The Kremlin leader has not been
seen in public since Dec. 27, 1984.

TOKYO (UPI) — South Korean
opposition leader Kim Dae Jung
said he’s ready to cooperate with
President Chun Doo Hwan but he is
not “begging dialogue.” Speaking at
a news conference in Tokyo on the
eve of his return from exile, Kim said
yesterday that he hopes his return
will bring stability and “not result in
creating social chaos.”

Kim narrowly lost the 1971 presi-
dential election to the late Park
Chung Hee. He was arrested in 1980
on the orders of Chun and con-
demned to death for sedition. The
sentence was commuted to a 20-year

to receive medical treatment in the
United States.

Kim, his wife and a 38-member
delegation ~ including twotop con-
gressmen — arrived in Tokyo yester-
day for an overnight stop.

They went with Kim to prevent his
sharing the fate of Philippine dissi-
dent leader Benigno Aquino. The
Philippine opposition leader was
murdered at the Manila Interna-
tional Airport upon his return in
August 1983.

WASHINGTON (UPI) - Presi-
dent Reagan blamed New Zealand
yesterday for creating problems in
the three-nation Anzus alliance yes-
terday, but said the defense pact is
still “very much alive.”

Reagan made his commentaftera
luncheon meeting with Australian
Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who
said, “The Anzus treaty remains."

The United States and Australia
cancelled scheduled Anzus military
maneuvers following New Zealand’s
refusal to let U.S. ships carrying
nuclear weapons use its ports. Aus-
tralia then advised the United States
that it would not allow U.S. planes
to use Australian airfields to moni-
tor planned MX missile tests in the
South Pacific later this year.

Hawke said the relationship
between Australia and the United
States under the 34-year-old South
Pacific Defense Pact “are undimin-
ished by recent events.”

I'll bet you were awake all week knowing that the ballots
were in for the,1984 Showcase Readers’ Poll. Iassure you,
we were, too. (Witness dark circles under our eyes and
perpetual A morning breath.) Thanks for the swift
response. It certainly gave) us something to do and even
brought a laugh from time to time. Well, as was expected
from a poll taken in these United States, Bruce Spring-
steen and Prince were big winners (and big losers — see
poll results). Also making strong public ‘impact were
squeaky Cyndi Lauper and those loveable white-flaggers
from Ireland, U2. It is certainly evident that Robert Plant
dribbled honey all over the hearts of Pitt students last year
and that we seem to be at odds over the integrity of
Madonna. In any case, she's definitely on our minds. (Take
from that what you. wish.) So folks, here's what you all
said. We must all learn to live with it.\ Orwell was wrong,
after all. (Or was he?) Thanks again.

J TFERSOII stranger than fICgtlOI1

3, ,

by Michael Selz

The Falcon and the Snowman is as pro-
vocative a spy story as has ever been
put to celluloid. Two kids in their
early 20s sell secrets to the KGB.

. While this real life drama was unfold-

ing in 1977, looking skyward you
could almost see the Hollywood mog-
uls‘ circling "like vultures over the
courthouse, greedily vying for the
film rights. ‘
Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hut-
ton) and Daulton Lee (Sean Penn) live
in the affluent L.A. suburb of Palos
Verdes and are childhood friends
who share a love of falconry. Boyce,

‘unable to resolve mounting doubt,

drops out of divinity school and takes
a job at TRW (RTX in the movie), an
aeronautics firm with plenty of
defense contracts. His spotless record
and his father's status as an ex-FBI
agent allow him a rapid series of pro-
motions and increased security clear-
ance, landing him a job in the ”black
vault," a room where information
from secret spy satellites is received.
After he accidentally. becomes privy

to information about illegal CIA med-~

dlings in other countries, he sheds his
already tenuous nationalism just as

he shed Catholicism. Not content to‘.
protest by quitting his job or selling

the story to The New York Times, he
decides to sell military secrets to
Russia.

But how? Well, his buddy Daulton
has spent his teens nurturing a thriv-

ing business selling illicit drugs and-

indulging in more than a few himself.

. The perfect counterculture capitalist,

Daulton likes money, power and
intrigue.'So Daulton agrees to go to
the Soviet embassy in Mexico City
and there connects with a KGB oper-
ative. After two lucrative years of
"leaking top-secret information
through this pipeline, he is arrested
by Mexican police on trumped—up

‘vous with the Russians,

FBI agents capture'Timothy Hutton (third from left) in The Falcon and the
Snowman. ' _
murder charges and deported to the
U.S.- for espionage.

The acting is superlative. Sean
Penn does a remarkable job of don--
ning the look of a "refugee from a

II

wealthy family. His clothing and
carriage show a studied awkward-
ness. He wears ill-fitting leisure wear

- and turtlenecks draped over his runty

frame and has thick, floppy brown

hair and a prepubescent wisp of a

moustache.” Arrogant and full of

moxie, he struts through his rendez-'
missing

appointments here and crashing‘
diplomatic parties there.- At one

point, he admonishes them, "O.K. If

you don't want 'em, Ican always go to

the Chinese!”

His vocal range is terrific, ranging
from a languid growl when he gets up
at noon to a whine of fear when he
feels out of control, spurred on by the
increasing amounts of heroin he
needs as the scam progresses. A lot of
the film's tension comes from our

by Stan Thomas Wozniak

Talk about saving graces. Maria's
Lovers could very easily have been a

' terrible film, and__at times it is. But it's

‘in’

not a completely senseless attempt to

re-evaluate the sexual beliefs that_

prevailed in the time period following
World War II. It is, in essence, on that
very level where it works the best.

Maria's Lovers is about love. It's
about passion. It's not about a war
figure coming home and finding his
old girlfriend sleeping with another
soldier. Rather, it's more about the
premise of what that passion impli-
cates. The misguided passion is
further complicated when the guy
finally gets the girl‘, finally gets mar-
ried, but remains impotent. It's an
obsession, and as one woman puts it:
"She lives in your dreams, not your
body.”

Director Andrei Konchalovsky has
made this a movie of revolving lovers.
So many people end up sleeping with
one another that it begins to get con-
fusing. Still, it may not be entirely his
fault. The screenplay credits are
divided between four individuals, all

Pillowq schlock

of whom most likely added fuel to. the
fire. The result is‘a screenplay that is
almost all sex talk (terrible lines like ”I
love you so much my whole body falls
apart"). __ *

Konchalovsky does have an eye for

detail. His camera is constantly show-
ing our hero (John Savage) in mirror
images. Though his imagery is pain- I

stakingly overused (an old lawn chair,
is abandoned atop a field andishown
between every four or five scenes),

the film has a notable European look ,

to.it. This alone is_reason enough to
see the film. The willowy fields and
mountain-edged riverbanks of
southwestern Pennsylvania never
looked quite so romantic. Lovingly
photographed by cinematographer
Juan R-uiz Anchia, I doubt they'll ever
be seen in film again. The film was
shot primarily in downtown Browns-
ville, though there's a repetitive view
of the riverbanks from the small

town of Coal Center, near California, -

Pa.

. Nastassja Kinski plays Maria with
the usual I'm-not-gonna-act-just-
look-pretty attitude. Sultry, innocent
and lackadaisical, she's cast perfectly
but gets into trouble every time she

  

awareness of how easily his stupid
bravado will destroy him. He tells a
girl at a party all about his activities,
attempting to seduce her ("Don't
worry, man. She didn't believe me,"
he assures his furious partner). Pul-
ling a -list of questions from the
Soviets out of his jeans, he tells
Boyce: "They want to know some
stuff. —I accidentally washed it, but I
think you can still read it."

Tim Hutton has done this bit
before, and he's good at it. Confused
and wrestling with forces out of his
control, he sets his jaw and twitches
convulsively. He wheels around, gets
violent, gets calm, gets compassion-.
ate, gets cruel. He acts all over the
place. The recipient of all this emo-
tional elevator stuff is Lori Singer, his
mutelyzadoring girlfriend.. She is as
vacuous a nymphet as Hollywood can
produce, and is completely unaware
of her boyfriend'sqsideline. Superfin-
ous to the plot, necessary to the real
life Chris Boyce.

Nastassja Kinski stars in Maria's Lover.

opens her mouth to speak. Robert
Mitchum pops up here and there. His

is basically an uninspired perfor«——

mance. John Savage seems to be try-
ing to read too much into the script as
our hero. But, three secondary char-
acters do make waves. Keith Carra-
dine is intensely sexual in the part of a
singer who seduces Kinski (he pro-
poses to her: "I can sing. And you can
wash my socks"). Vincent Spano
gives an appropriately obnoxious
performance as the young soldier,
And Anita Morris (from Broadway's

 

The real problem of this film is in
its stance on the duo's guilt. The boys
are virtually excused as a'product of
their time. Watergate, Vietnam,
Chile and other images are thrown
up to us as rationales, justification for
the misguided patriotism of a doomed
idealist. Boyce at least is painted up as
a tragic hero. Poor thing, if he could
only have seen his folly. In Hutton’s
previous film, Daniel, Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg were executed for a less
flagrant treason, merely because
McCarthyism whipped the nation
into such an anti-communist frenzy
that the public sanctioned such pun-

‘ ishment. In this case, Boyce got a life

sentence and Lee 40 years. Boyce
showed his repentance in 1979 by
escaping prison for»19‘rnon.ths and

robbing banks. We are meant to‘

mourn for this unfortunate pair in

the film. Should we?

Pat Metheny's soundtrack is non-
descript and adds little to the mood or

momentum. It works great in scenes‘

where Boyce’s hawk careens through
the wild blue yonder because it's
giddy and ‘carefree like the bird
(though ' the metaphoric rhythms
between hawk and satellite weigh it
down a little — the CIA nickname for
spy satellite is "bird")‘. But aside from
these falconing scenes, you don't
notice the soundtrack — this from a
jazz_ composer who is often said to be
"cinematic" in his compositional abili-
ties. The David Bowievocal on the
song "This is not America" is forget-
table and uninspired, especially when
compared to Cat People's "Putting Ou

Fire.” ‘

Ultimately, a few flaws don't mat-
ter as much when a thriller is as well-
paced and relentless as this. The story
and the acting will bowl youover, and
for that, you can deal with ‘a little
moral ambiguity as you leave the
theater. J « '

''Nine'') is enchanting and funny as a
daffy redhead.

As it stands, Maria's Lovers is a film
worthwhile to any native southwest-
ern Pennsylvanian. Shame the invita-
tion can't be extended, though,
because the film does have potential
(the awkward editing may have done
something to the final product, I sus-
pect). Throughout the film, people
are constantly wiping up their floors.

Perhaps the makers of Maria's Lovers

’ should have cleaned up their own

minds to make this a better picture.

FRANCESC TORRES: TOUGH
LIMO

Museum of Art, Carnegielnstitute
Now through Mar. 24

by Vicki Zeitner

Francesc Torres demonstrates
genuine insight into the state of mod-
ern civilization in his latest work,
Tough Limo, 1983. Inspired by the
theoretical writings of neurophysiol-
ogist Paul D. MacLean, Torres pres-
ents a powerful evocation of
primitive behavioral patterns —
aggression and territoriality «-
embodied in the ”civilized” war
machine.

The exhibition consists of a model
armored tank manned by live igua-
nas. Arranged around the tank and
elsewhere in the room are folding
chairs and a projected videotape. The
military tank stands, dark and impos-
ing, as a display of power, ready to
defend its defined geographical (or

 

   

ideological) territory. Its crew of
iguanas, encased in cockpit—like terra-
ria visible on the tank's surface,
represents the Reptilian Complex (R-
Complex), the most primitive part of
the triune brain model. According to

Torres presents a
powerful evocation of
primitive behavioral
patterns embodied in the
"civilized" war
machine.

MacLean’s theory, the Reptilian
Complex has stubbornly remained
with us through evolution, and is
supposedly the source of man's
aggressive behavior.

The videotape installation is
approximately 10 fascinating min-
utes long, with images ranging from

1

Institute.

Russian tanks in Prague in 1968 to
the assassination of Anwar Sadat.
One of the most interesting seg-
ments in the video is a series of four
scenes in which a toy tank closes in on
a house of cards. The first two scenes
seem to represent the two World
Wars, as only isolated parts of the
structure are destroyed. In the third

Great riffs of fire‘, Albert Collins burns down the house

By Dave Hooker/ The Pitt News

ALBERT COLLINS

The Decade
February 5, 1985

by Paul Anderson

Be it Four More Years and the Five-
Year Plan, or the continued success of
heavy metal and MTV, Pittsburghers
have the right to sing the blues. It was
no surprise, then, to see the Decade
packed with blues fanson Tuesday
night to witness Albert Collins and
the Icebreakers.

Scheduled to appear at 10:30 with-
out an opening act. the master of the
Telecaster and his traveling blues cir-
cus were over an hour late because of
an automobile breakdown outside of
Pittsburgh.

The Icebreakers, with Rob Noll
(the sole white man) as lead picker,
warmed up the crowd with several
mercurial rockin’ rave-ups. Com-
pared to past recordings, the band
was amazingly funky. The magical
rhythm section featured several Ike
ard Tina Turner Band alums.

There was definitely no shortage
of soul food with Leon Blue as cool as
can be on electric piano and Soko
Richardson on drums. Bassist Johnny
B. Gayden was the backbone here,
laying down a‘ bottom end that was
irresistibly groovy and danceable.
Abb Lock contributed his coolly
understated sax work and laid back
presence. 1 A

It didn't take long for the mood to
be right for the appearance of the
razor blade man, Albert Collins.
Dressed to the nines in a spectacular

three-piece orange suit, the blues
leviathan, like a mad dentist,
extracted high—pitched squeals and
whines from his abused '61 Telecas-
ter. Accompanying these grinding ax
noises was an array of tortured gri-
maces and tongue-in-cheek poses, all
of which beautifully complemented
Collins’ comforting and soulful
vocals.

Collins ventured into the crowd at
one point to do some offstage jam-
ming. Working his way through the
frenzied audience, the Iceman didn't
miss a note as he played a lengthy
Texas blues solo with his often
imitated spine-tingling vibrato and
frozen percussive guitar attack.

After taking a much needed break,
Collins invited some Pittsburghers to
jam onstage. An unexpected but
warmly welcomed guest was Warren
King, a guitarist who plays regularly
at the Decade with his blues band
Red, Hot, & Blue. King traded leads

4 with Collins on a transcendent rendi-

tion of the classic T-Bone Walker
slow blues, ”Stormy Monday.” Fin-
ishing the set, Collins hurled the
band into a nonstop medley of some
of his most classic ”cold cuts,” includ-
ing the hyper—hip ”Frostbite.”

The set ended around three
o'clock, and the audience, both very
drunk and very much in awe,
stumbled into the Oakland air. The
crowd was receptive to Collins’
genius, showing the appreciation
rightfully deserved to the man who

may very well be the king of the B

blues.
Not bad for a cold Tuesday night.

produce an awesome and haunting
reminder of the destructive power
which is at man's disposal.

One is not certain whether Torres
is predicting that mankind is doomed
to succumb to its primitive instincts,
whether he believes that aggression
is an. inherent instinct or whether
human reason can and will rescue
mankind from imminent destruction.

These questions are left to the
observer.

What is clear, however, is a strug-
gle played out between these tenden-
cies. There are clips in the video of a
man struggling with and finally sub-
duing a boa constrictor, and a fourth
scene of the toy tank playfully lifting
up cards from the top of the house. In
the final scene, however, the tank
steers away from the house of ‘cards

and a crowd applauds. Torres seems
to suggest that there is hope --
though the line between reason and
instinct and between creation and

.destruction is a tenuous one.

Tough Limo is a must—see exhibit
for anyone interested in modern art
as a vehicle for gaining insight and
understanding into the problems,
potentials and realities of modern
civilization. V

Panthers roll
Providence,

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Court-
side, Jack Rohan couldn’t have
found a better seat to watch the bud-
ding point guard do as he had
instructed several hours earlier.

Rohan, a former Columbia bas-
ketball coach turned USA Cable
commentator and forever the preci-
sion shot mentor, instructed Curtis
Aiken on the finer points of convert-
ing. Wednesday morning, Rohan
spent over 15 minutes with Aiken.
The sophomore listened. Later. that
night, Aiken put the advice to good
use. The Panthers (13-7, 4-5) went
on to pound Providence 68-55.

Aiken, though hitting 10.4 ppg on
too many shots taken, scored a
career-high 19 points at Providence
Civic Center, due in a large part to
Rohan’s tutoring.

“I know he was doing three or
four things wrong,” Rohan later
said. “For one, he wasn’t stopping
with his eyes on the rim. There’s a
rhythm when you release the ball. It
has to be the same, and he was vary-
ing. As a result of the first two
things, he faded away from the
basket more than he needed to. I
told him he has a great shot — he
never lost that shot but just got into
bad habits.”

A minute and a half into the game,
Aiken poised a shot from the top of
the key that fell cleanly. It was a
prelude to the anguish Aiken put the
Friars (9-14, 2-8) through.

“It was marvelous that he did
everything right on that first shot,”

68- 55

Rohan said. “If that was an airball,
the bubble could have burst, all con-
fidence lost.”

Though Rohan can’t guarantee
better things to come, the Provi-
dence game proved how pivotal
Aiken can be.

“I‘m not just setting up the
offense,” Aiken said. “I’m going out
and looking for the shot. Before the
game, I felt confidentjust by the way
I was shooting.”

Held to only six points in the first
half, Aiken erupted in the second as
the Panthers surmounted their 25-22”
halftime lead to engulf a noticeably
weaker Friar squad. "

When not going 8-13 from the
field, Aiken produced seven assists
(tops). Often on the receiving end,
Charles Smith produced 13 points
and non-starter Joey David a sur-
prising 12.

Only twice did Aiken stray from
the top of the key when shooting.

“He was excellent," Chipman
said. “He was looking for his shots
more, which we asked him to. And
he wasn’t hesitating.”

“It’s just a matter of adjusting,”
said Aiken, still very aware that he’s
undergoing a high school transition.
“I’m in a different situation. I’m get-
ting more confident as we go along."

Pitt gymnasts off to New Hampshire

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

Along with their snowshoes, the
women’s gymnastics team will take
hopes of knocking off gymnastics
powerhouses New Hampshire and
Denver. Head coach Donna Sanft’s
squad will head to the University of
New Hampshire on Friday for a
quad meet on Saturday.

“This meet always comes down to
the final event,”'warned Sanft, cau-
tiously optomistic about her team’s
chances this weekend. “We defi-
nitely could win. We’re right in the
same range as New Hampshire.
Right now, Denver looks like the
team to beat, but it will come down
to whoever hits their routines the
best.”

One thing working against the
Pitt squad is a recent rash ofinjuries,
the most serious to Katie
Monaghan, a freshman competing
in vault and floor exercises. “Her
injury is going to hurt us because the

two events in which she competes
are probably our two weakest
events.”

“I have stress fractures on my legs,
so I'll be out for about a month.

There is nothing I can do about it, .

just rest,” said Monaghan. “IfI work
out with the legs like they are now
they could end up breaking.”

Aside from this, Sanft said even if
the team does not finish in first
place, there are several individual
Lady Panthers who could. “Any one
of our all-arounds, Kim Calderone,
Beth Waters, Kristy Pieters and
Alisa Spector, could win; they just
have to hit their routines well.”
However, Sanft also mentioned a
New Hampshire gymnast —— Laura
Cavanaugh — whom she would rate
as the favorite in the all-around. One
advantage__Pitt has is that the talent
is spread around. The Lady Pan-
thers are not a team of a few super-
stars but several solid performers.
“It's really neat with the team we
have,” Sanft said, “because there is
no one person we count on for every-
thing. It takes the pressure off any
one individual.” ‘

At least one of the all-arounds is
anxious to get the meet underway.
“I’m really excited about it. I just
hope we can do as well as we are
capable of,” said Beth Waters. “We
had a tough week practicing. A lot of
people were getting hurt and getting
sick. But I think we can pull together
and have a good meet.”

Kristy Pieters echoed those senti-
ments. “We should do OK. We have
had a lot of injuries this week, but I
think it will be all right.” Pieters also
mentioned that Pitt has a limited
number of gymnasts attending this
meet. “Normally, we have six people
in each event, with one as an alter-
nate or in case somebody doesn’t hit,
but at this meet, we will only have
five in each event. That means all
five people will have to hit well. It
puts a lot of pressure on everybody
to do well.”

Notes: Pitt travels to the New
Hampshire meet every other year.
The team will arrive in Boston early
tomorrow and practice in New
Hampshire at 4 p.m. The team
returns from Boston on Sunday.

Weather,

The Pitt News

As the University of Pittsburgh
men's track team traveled to Mor-
gantown, W. Va., one of Mother
Nature’s strongest forces was falling
throughout the Eastern Seaboard.
This force was, of course, the small
white powdery substance known as
snow. The harsh weather had a two-
fold effect on a Panther team
attempting to defeat the Mountain-
eers in their own backyard.

First, the Panthers were hit by the
flu bug — hardest in the long dis-
tance part of the team as both Rod-
ney Giles and Scott Abel were

illness, West Virginia hound runners

unable to compete. Second, due to
the bad weather, the Kent State
team was unable to make the trip to
Morgantown, thus transforming a
scheduled quad-meet into a tri—meet.
This allowed the Mountaineers to
pick up “trash points" that they
would not normally have received.
West Virginia sprinted past the
Panthers 87-61, while Cleveland
State finished third with a mere nine
points.

Kent State’s absence was espe-
cially felt in the field events, in many
of which the Panthers have no
entries. Varsity head coach John
Vasvary had commented before the
meet: “Kent State will be the decid-
ing factor in the meet, as their
strength lies in the field events, in
which they will either win or be close

to the top. The points that they get
could help us, as we score well in our
strengths, which are the track
events." Without the Golden
Flashes in the meet, the door was
open, and the Mountaineers seized
the opportunity.

A telling example of the effect of
Kent State’s absence is what
occurred in the shot put. WVU’s
winning toss was 49 meters, while
Kent State has three athletes who
throw over 55. Another event in
which the Golden Flashes were
missed was the long jump. This
could almost be called a “Catch 22”
situation for the Panthers. Although
they received a boost when George
lfill won the event with ajump of 22
feet and 2.5 inches, the Panthers
were outscored in the event 6-5, due
to the scoring system of 5-3-2-1
given for finishing first through
fourth, respectively, and WVU fin-
ished second, third and fourth.

Vasvary said, “Our depth or lack
of it, especially in the field events —
and this week in the track events due
to the flu — is what killed us on
Saturday. West Virginia had the
people in places that we didn’t, and
Cleveland State didn’t give us any
help. In meets scored like this one
was, you hope to get a little help in
some areas, but we just didn’t get
any.”

But this meet was not a total dis-
appointment for the Panthers, as
they ran well in some areas. Lee
McRae won the 55 meters with a
time of 6.22, which would have qual-
ified him for the NCAAs in the event

A true story

had he not already previously quali-
fied. Rogers Thomas finished
second in the event with a time of
6.54. The 55-meter hurdles was won
by R. Smith of WVU with Calvin
Holmes, Jason Harris and Darren
Rogers finishing second, third and
fourth with times of 7.54, 7.75 and
7.84, respectively.

In the 300 meters, WVU‘s John
Mair won the race, followed by
Pitt‘s Lee McRae with a time of34.5
and Roger Thomas with a time of
35.5. In the 400, Dorell Hilliman
won with a time of 49.66, followed
by Shane Saunders who finished
third at 51.84. In the 500 meters.
Jesse Mikell finished first, followed
very closely by Alan Laws, as they
finished with times of 105.06 and
105.08.

The winner of the 800 and 1,500

meters for WVU was Kenyan Gene
Paul Nadyisenga, and it was these
events that hurt the Panthers.
Nadyisenga’s winning time was
155.5 in the 800, whereas Rodney
Giles has previously run a 153 and
Scott Abel a 154. Mickey Rihtarchik
finished third in the 800 with a time
of 157.04. One of the few bright
spots was the 1,000 meters, which
was won by Tim Manes with a time
of 229.64. Joe Daniels finished
fourth with a 358.4.
Dorell Hilliman, Cantu Holmes,
Jesse Mikell and Alan Laws won
with an lC4A qualifying time of

for the Panthers, Jim Johnson won

ple all the time. If he brings his eyes
up, he'll see everybody and the
basket. Then he’ll be a threat to
defenses. And [teammates] will
benefit richly."

The Panthers shot a strong 54.3
percent from the field to Providen-

’ce’s 44.l. Center Ray Knight, its
double—figure scorer (17), provided
what meager punch the Friars
showed.

The Friars never registered an
offensive rebound during the first
half, finishing with seven as Smith
and Darryl Shepherd, who played a
strong 22 minutes, combined for 13
rebounds.

“At the end we got good shots and
tried to keep them at bay," Smith
said.

David, the junior second guard
who twice lost a starting job to
Demetreus Gore because of his 36.4
shooting, inhabited the corner base-
lines, converting on 5-of-9 overall.

Chipman stuck with him for 24
minutes, eight more than Gore.

“That’s what happens. You get a
lot of playing time,” David said,

“and it wasn’t like 1 was thinking of

coming out. Those shots I missed

were easy ones, due to a little lack of

concentration. 1 realize that.”
More importantly, the Panthers

understand their increasing depend-

ence upon another guard, Curtis

Aiken. It is only now that Aiken
himself is beginning to log into that
program of thinking.

Offthe Boards: Tomorrow's game
against Seton Hall begins at noon,
instead ofthe originally listed 8 p.m.
tipoff.

Rohan claims nothing unusual
about “an outside person getting
involved" — this time at Chipman’s
insistence - “in a free exchange of
ideas.

“Curtis should have a very good
understanding of what we talked
about so he can work on it alone,”
said Rohan. “The better he does, the
more he’1l believe.”

Chipman downplayed Pitt’s 13
turnovers in the first half (21 over-
all). “We’re not as concerned as we
used to be,” he said. “When the game
was on the line, we were pretty
strong.”

Pitt women drop third consecutive game 80-68  

By Michael Bertonaschl
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s basketball team
traveled to the fabled “Cat House"
on Wednesday night to play Villano-
va, which resulted in Pitt’s third
straight loss 80-68.,

A After falling behind early, the
Panthers (12-10) made a furious
scramble and closed the gap to 35-31
with two minutes remaining in the
first half. The Wildcats (I6-5) took
advantage of some sloppy passes by
the Panthers and converted them
into baskets to escape the half with a
39-31 lead.

The Wildcats were led in the first
half by sophomore guard Karen
Hargadon who made six of seven
field goals, all from about 20 feet out
to the left of the key. Pitt got 10
points from Lisa Fubio, who failed
to score in the second half.

Pitt started out cold in the second
half. When Teresa Pasik hit a 10-
foot jumper at the 10:15 mark, the

Wildcats led 57-45. Villanova then
settled in a 2-3 zone defense and col-
lapsed on leading scorer Jennifer
Bruce.

A “In the beginning of the game, we
held Bruce fairly well but all the oth-
ers were killing us from the outside,”
said Villanova head coach Harry
Peretta. “In the second half they
missed a couple shots early and we
got up by 10 and 12 points; then I'm
content to stay in a zone and let them
shoot.”

With the Wildcats collapsing on
Bruce and the Panther guards not
hitting the outside shots, there was
little chance for a Pitt victory. “We
thought that if we could stop Jen-
nifer Bruce and control the defensive
boards that we would be OK,” said
freshman forward Lisa Angelotti.

Angelotti played Bruce head-to-
head throughout most of the game
and the two smooth forwards seem
to have developed an intense rivalry
since their first meeting, a 65-64 Vil-
lanova win at the field house on Jan.

Angelotti, “but I thought the whole

her and I think that was the differ-
ence in the game."

Bruce had been averaging 24
points a game but was held to 17,
only the fifth time this season that
she has scored under 20. Senior
guard Stephanie Collins came off
the bench to pump in 16 points and
Fubio and Tirik each had 10.»

Villanova‘s front line of forwards,
Angelotti, Shelly Pennefather and
center Mary Delory came alive after
a slow first half. The three combined
for 42 points and 30 rebounds.
“Those two forwards [Pennefather
and Angelotti] may be the best tan-
dem in the Big East,” said Peretta.
“But tonight our center had a good
game and when we get the third
player into the action we are a much
better team.” The Lady Wildcats
also got 14 points from Karen Har-
gadon and eight from point guard
Lynn Tighe.

Now the question is: Who will be
the main competition to challenge
Villanova in the championship tour-
nament at the end of the month?

“Syracuse, definitely,” offered
Angelotti, “because it’s on their
home court and they beat us by 15,
but we beat them by seven.”

Coach Peretta preferred a more
diplomatic answer. “I think any of
the first six teams can win it.”

Meanwhile, back in Oakland, Pitt
now has a trio oflosses, and a 12-10
record and are 7-5 and stuck in the
middle of the pack in the Big East
standings. Suddenly, a predicted
first-place finish and a Big East
championship seems unlikely. =

The Panthers will play Duquesne
(13-9) in a non—conference game Sat-
urday at 5:30 p.m. at the field house.
“We just have to try to play as well as
we can against Duquesne and take it
from there,” said assistant coach
Kirk Bruce.

our intensity. I think that these girls
must try to the best oftheir abilities
to be as intense as they can for the
entire game. When we lose our
intensity, then we fall behind and do

things we’re not supposed to do,” ,

There will be seven other teams

who will be in an intense mood when
the Lady Panthers travel to Syra-
cuse to play in the Big East tourna-
ment at the end ofthe month. If Pitt
does not choose to join them, their
stay in upstate New York will be a
short one.

Hickman an easy All-America

By Mitch Vingle
For The Pitt News

Somewhere in Mission, Kan.,
there is a black and white computer
printout. The printout, stored in the
NCAA headquarters, lists the colle-
giate Division I swimmers that have
qualified for the NCAA Champion-
ships to be held March 21-23 at the
University of Alabama.

Susan Hickman, a sophomore at
the University of Pittsburgh, is on
that list. But she is much more than a
name on a list. She is an insightful
person and a proud athlete.

As a freshman, Hickman attained
All-America status by tying for
fourth place I in the NCAA’s 50-
meter freestyle with a time of 23.26.
She also won the 50-meter and 100-
meter freestyle in the Big East cham-
pionships. This year, she qualified
for the NCAA 50-meter freestyle by
posting a 23.46 time as the lead-off
member of a 200-meter free relay
team at the Penn State Relays.

If the talent is there, most
swimmers have to condition them-
selves to the point where qualifying
is possible. That takes time. But

. Hickman broke the barrier on Dec.

1. That's more than three months
ahead of the deadline.

“She’s a l-ittle further ahead of
where she was last year,” said Lady

Panther coach Dave Belowich.
“Last year, she laid the ground work
to become a bona fide 50-meter
sprinter. Now, she’s not only going
after the 50, but the I00 as well."

Hickman‘s goals this year are to
win the NCAA 50-meter free event
and gain All-America status in the
I00-meter free. The second goal will
be even tougher to achieve than the
first. “I think I have a mental hangup
in the I00,” she said. “I have to get
through that. I don’t have a lot of
confidence there.”

Hickman won the 100 free in the
Big East Championships, which for
the third straight year, will be held at
Pitt’s Trees Pool Feb. 28-Mar. 1.
But the 50 free is her main event.

“For me the 50 is a special event,”
she said. ‘—‘I enjoy it a great deal. I like
to go as fast as I can every time out.”

A lot of sprinters are character-
ized as off-the-wall. Many prepare
themselves for the race by “going

I bananas.” But Hickman is soft-
spoken. “I know a lot of people find
it easier to race if they get angry,” she
said. “I just concentrate on what I
want to do. I’m conscious of the
other swimmers.” '

The drive to outdistance the com-
petition may be a strong point for
Hickman. But that isn‘t what makes
her world-class. “I don’t want to
sound conceited,” she said, “but the
Big East competition in the 50 isn’t
that strong. So I really can’t rely on
the competition to push me. Mostly,

V ‘The Pitt News, Friday, February 8, I985

Basketball team

By Jim Urban
The ‘Pitt News

Life is full of ups and downs;
sometimes they come at _the same
time. Such is the case down on the
bluff, at Duquesne University.
While the men’s basketball program
flounders in the midst of much con-
troversy, the 'women’s program,
under the direction of second-year
coach Paul Hindes, has finally
begun toprosper.

The Duchesses, as they like to be
called, are in their second year _of
NCAA Division I basketball. They
tip off with Pitt tomorrow at 5:30
p.m. at Fitzgerald Field House.
After suffering through a tough 8-17
season last year, Duquesne has
experienced a turn of the tide. The
Duchesses have a 13-7 record and
are currently riding a five-game win-
ning streak.

“We’ve really turned it around,"
said Hindes, “especially compared
to last year." ‘

Indeed they have. Comprised
mostly of western Pennsylvania tal-
ent, Duquesne has built a respecta-
ble team.

Duquesne is led by junior guard
Becky Oglevee from Uniontown
High School. Oglevee is averaging
15.7 ppg and over six assists per

Pitt swimmer making waves

continued from page eighteen
business major is slow with her
words. She ponders each syllable
before voicing an opinion. She is a
deep thinker. Ironically, that deep

‘thinking sometimes interferes with
her school work. _

“I love to learn,” she said. “Some-
times I get so caught up in a lecture
that I forget to take notes.”

Hickman, however, never forgets
her team. “It really feels good to be
part of this team,” she said. “We’re
still real young. Last year, we had 11
freshmen. This year, I think we have
six. We don’t7have a lot of expe-
rience as a group, so, taking that
under consideration, I think we’ve
done a lot.”

_The women’s team won the Big
East in both I982 and 1983. Last
year, the team outdistanced second-
place Syracuse by,l2l points. Hick-
man attributes the team‘s success to
a strong bond.

“I feel a strong sense of loyal‘; to
the team,” she said. “I get a lot of
motivation and a lot of the strength

you need in the pool from the team.

“Dave [Belowich] has told ‘me that
I have a lot of pride. That pride is not

. only in myself. I have pride in being

a part of the program. I am proud of
representing the university. I am
proud of getting points for the team.
lt’s a good feeling.” '

“Music is an outlet for me," she
said. “For a lot of kids, the, outlet is
partying. Mine is music. It keeps me
sane.” Hickman plays the piano and
is learning to play the guitar. _,

“I think the 50 free is an artistic
event,” she said. “It’s so fast that
there’s not much strategy. You just

let your body go and let it do what it '

can.”

Fortunately for Pitt fans, Hick-
man will be watercoloring for two
more years. I

game. Joining Oglevee in the back--
court is senior Amy King from Mt.
Lebanon.

\ Up front, the Duchesses are paced
by, 5-1] sophomore Tanya Larry-
dale. Larrydale, a Laurel Highlands
product, is averaging over 13 ppg,
and has grabbed gover nine boards
per game. Five-eight senior Carol
Burchlaw and 6-2 freshman Kim
Kunkle round out Hindes’ lineup.
This group is fresh offa 98-49 romp
over St. Francis on Wednesday
night.

While Duquesne is enjoying the
best of times, Pitt iaas fallen upon
_hard times. The Panthers have
dropped three in a row after their
loss at Villanova on Wednesday
night. Pitt is currently I2-I0 overall,

I 7-5 in the Big East.

Pitt needs to put together a streak,
as Duquesne has done, if they are
going to challenge for the top spot of
the Big East. The team begins a
three-game homestand tomorrow
afternoon with Duquesne, so there
will _not be a better opportunity to
mount an offensive.

After Duquesne, Seton Hall will
be in town Feb. I3 and Big East
co-leader Boston College will play
here Feb. 16.

9 Notes: Jennifer Bruce leads the
Big East in scoring with a 24.l aver-
age  Bruce is also third in rebound-
ing (8.8) and fourth in free-throw
percentage (70 percent) .
