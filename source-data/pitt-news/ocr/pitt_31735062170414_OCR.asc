Tight Budget Cuts Film Use Work-Study Program

by non OBENREDEB

‘A decrease in the use of in-class
films may be a result of a short-
age of funds in the Communication
Center‘s Audiovisual Services De-
partment, which provides films,
equipment, and operating person-
nel for University faculty and stu-
dents‘.

Dr. David Crossman, Assistant
Director of Library Institutional
and Research Services, described
the shortage as a result of an in-
crease in wages and demand for
services with no increase in funds.

“Money for Audiovisual Serv-
ices is provided by an allocation
system based on services pro-
vided the previous year and a pro-

- jection of need for the coming
year,” Dr. Crossman explained.
“This money_is divided on a pro-

" ‘ portionate basis, and allocated to

each department according to de-
mand. However, there is not
enough money to go around on an
unlimited basis.” No department,
then, is allocated enough funds to
pay for all the service they re-
quire.

"When the allocations run_out."»

Dr. Crossman continued. "we ac-
cept a budget modification for
services from the department.“
This, essentially, is a transfer of
funds from the department to Au-
diovisual to pay for service. If the
academic department is unable to
modiﬁcation.
‘service cannot be provided.

Dr. Crossman explained that
temporary service is being pro-
vided to departments not able to
furnish budget modifications be-
cause extra money is available
due to the resignation of a staff
member. However. these extra
funds will last only one month.

“The capacity to serve a de-
partment is wholly dependent on

the part-time funds’ available,”

Dr. Crossman stated. Part-time
funds are monies used. to pay for
the projectionists hired on a part-

time basis from the student body.

"A major problem is achieving
an appropriate balance between
part-time and full—time em-
ployees." Dr. Crossman said. ex-
plaining that money goes further
when used for part-time help. but
that a full-time staff is necessary
to coordinate and provide service
when part-time people are not
available.

According to Dr. Crossman. the
budget modification system pro-
hibits flexibility, because money

1 supplied by one department can-

not be used to provide service for
another.

Charles Bailey, Supervisor of

Audiovisual Services, s t r e s s e it
this point, saying it would be bet-
ter to give the money needed for
service directly to the Commun-
ications Center, eliminating the
need for the extra bookwork in-
volved in budget modifications.

Bailey quoted some statistics
illustrating the acute lack of
funds. Money to hire part-time
help was cut from $12,000 last
year to $4,000 this year. Thirteen
per cent of this figure is consum-
ed in equipment. preparation and
repair.

At $2 per hour. this limits the
part-time hours available. Last
year there were 5.358 jobs. and at
the present 24 per cent increase.
this year’s demand will be 6.644,
possibly going as high as 8,000.

The equipment budget has also
been cut from $25,000 in 1969 to
$10,000 this year.

The effects of the fund shortage
could be great. Bailey mentioned
the Art Education Department
has already cut back on films be-
cause of a decrease in their bud-
get.

Dr. Alan E. Fisher, Chairman
of the Psychology Department,
said the shortage would "probably
effect us more than any other de-
partment,” since they use 10.6

New Student Activities Advisor Appointed

per cent of the films shown by Au-
diovisual, more than any other de-
partment. Dr. Fisher estimated
the department would need more
than 300 hours over their allot-

— ment of 106 hours. "I asked the

teachers to cut back as much as
possible." he said. but he empha-
sized the importance of films,
saying. “Sometimes they are
more useful than a lecture."

The Department of Speech and
Theatre Arts is the second highest
academic audiovisual user at the
University. Dr. Jack Matthews,
Chairman, said the effects of the
shortages would “probably be no
different from any other depart-
ment . . . the professors can’t
show as many films.” said the
cutback in film usage “may result
in lowering the quality of instruc-
tion.” '

Dr. -Matthews stated films play
"a very important role" in the
Speech Department. “There are
some things you just can’t get
across as well with lectures or

Exhibits Unusual Surplus

by RICK EULER

The Work-Study Program at the
University finds itself in the un-
usual position of having processed
all applications and discovering
the existence of surplus funds.

Charles R. Dees. Director of
Student Aid, explained that the
directors of the program were un-
able to foresee the circumstances-
which led to the surplus. _

“We get everything we request-
ed from the state in the way of al- ‘
locations,” Dees said, “and we
found that after we had placed all
our applicants, we still had avail-
able funds.”

Dees added that the program
had _“utilized all of its resources“
and “contacted as many agencies
as possible“ in placing students.
However, the Work-Study Pro-
gram now hopes to find additional

‘— applicants in order to make use

of their remaining funds.

Dees emphasized that the pro-
gram cannot and will not ignore
its standards because of the sur-
plus.

He explained that, in order for
a student to qualify for the pro-
gram, he must “show financial
need and have the available time
to hold a job while studying.”

"Also,” he added, “if we feel" '5 A’

that the student’s family has suf-

_ficient means to help finance the

cost of education, we will refuse
his application, even though he
himself may show the need.”

Dees commented. however, that
he did not want to discourage stu-
dents from applying.

“Since we have the funds, I want
to promote and advertize the pro-
gram as much as possible,” he

stated. “If a student is interested, . 

he should at least apply and find
out if he is eligible.”

Bouvier Named Assistant to Moye.

general student welfare. -

Peter Bouvier was recently named assistant to
Dr. Alfred Moye. Dean of Student Affairs. In his
new role as student activities advisor, Bouvier
expects to research. plan. and advise the Dean and
the students on programs that will render total
service to the student body.

L Bouvier comes to the University confident of
his experience in student affairs. His confidence in
himself is well founded. Before accepting his new
position at Pitt, he was president of the graduate
student body of UCLA. representing 12.000 grad-
fgate students as well as statewide president for
grad students in California. Bouvier was also chair-
man of the first California student lobby to oper-
ate on a professional basis for state and federal
legislation.

As president of the graduate students at UCLA,
Bouvier has sampled all phases of student affairs
and administration since the student government at
UCLA handles all budget allocations collected from
student tuitions and activities fees.

Student government under the University of Cali-
fornia system also controls operation of the book-
store. food store. and health services. "With a com-
bined budget of $16.000.000.” stated Bouvier. stu-

dents assume real responsibility and quit playing in

the sandbox."
Under such a system. students work seriously‘

together with the administration to promote aca-‘

demic and community projects and to improve

Accustomed to the serious activism at UCLA,
Bouvier’s first impression of Pitt was that no con-
troversv seemed appare_nt,_ only student apathy.
Activity seems to be oriented toward individual
clubs and factions rather than to the student body in
general. ‘

Bouvier, however. did not consider the Universi-
ty of California system as an ideal one but only as a
contrast to the situation at Pitt.

Considering his role in student activities at
Pitt, the new member of student affairs staff sees
himself not as a catalyst but as a supplier of effec-
tive input for change. Bouvier expresses his confi-

dence in Dr. Moye and Bill Markus. Assistant Dean '

of Student Affairs. "who really don‘t want to screw
the students."

Already involved in his new job, Bouvier is
working -on the upcoming student health survey, in-
quiring about students opinions and suggestions. He
is also accumulating research on a learning skills
development center for remedial and tutorial serv-
ices. A major portion of his time is also alloted to
the Veterans Association Office, attempting to in-
form and help returning Vietnam veterans on ad-
missions, scholarships, and loans.

. Bouvier is a believer in student activism. "Stu- -

dent government, student newspapers. administra-
tors as well as students themselves must open their
eyes to student rights and responsibilities.'i asserted
Bouvier. '

Jan. 4 and will include four nights
in Acapulco and five nights in Mexi-
co City. The cost is only $249
which includes all land and air
costs. If you bought a commer-
cial flight round-trip ticket, it
would run $258 and that doesn’t in-
clude land costs such as hotels and
meals. It’s really a bargain to go

. on our group-sponsored trip.

Another trip is being planned
to the French Alps. The cost in-
volved will be $399 a person; the
trip running from, Dec. 23 to Jan.
1. Jeffries’ fearsiit will be a lit-
tle too expensive f'or students. It
was planned with the University
Travel Service.

"We're also working on a trip to
Malaga. Spain. for April 15 to 23
next year." Jeffries noted. “It will
be $299 a person round-trip-jet-.
air fare and hotel expenses. The
hotel will be near the beach. This
trip wasalso co-ordinated with
L'niversityTravel.

“The only other trip we’re now
planning is to Honolulu next sum-
mer, Aug. 20 to 27. It will also be

‘$299 aperson for round trip ex-

penses. The hotel will be either
near or on the beach.”

Jeffries said the University
doesn‘t send any chaperones on
the trips. but does have a Univer-
sity representative go along.

Jeffries is .also the advi-
sor to COTA. the Committee for
the Arts. Formerly with North
Carolina A&T State University.‘
She came to Pitt this September.
"I find the University students
very friendly and very nice. They
like to have everything done on a
personal basis, which is good. It's ‘
not what I expected at a large city-
university like this."

This September COTA spon-

sored a hair-styling demonstr.a- -

tion in the Towers. Jefferies said
"The show was open from 11 a..m.
to«3 p.m. At 2:45 we had 15 peo}.
ple in line waiting for the oppor-

tunity to have their hair cut. The _

response was tremendous."

COTA helped bring Jane Fonda
to campus earlier this month and
will. also help with the jazz semi-

nar scheduled for this week. The‘.

New Shakespeare Company, San
Francisco troupe, and their pro-
duction of Romeo and Juliet at
Pitt was sponsored by COTA.

Currently, Jeffries is helping
plan a mountain music festival
which she would like to have some-
time next spring. It will include
seminars, workshops, a concert,
and a coffee house. She‘ said,
"Most of these musicians are
from Appalachia and make their
instruments there. We want to

bring in these people and have.

them play the songs that tell about
their culture.“

on Wednesday at 8 p.m. and
the Gospel Concert on Thurs-
day at 8:30 p.m. will be held
in the Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health Auditorium, not the
Carnegie Lecture Hall as listed V

Pine Room Will Open for Luncheon Service

Occur in Student Union

Change to

by DEBBIE POPP

The extent of renovation in the
Student Union is not confined to
the new Schenley Recreation Cen-
ter. Change is also occurring in
the basement level of the building.
The newly decorated Pine Room.
across from the Hunt Room. will
open next week to handle any
overflow from the Hunt Room
luncheon service.

The major addition to the Pine
Room is the cafeteria tables. The
food service in the Hunt Room is
expected to expand their hot food
line to entice faculty and students.
Operational procedure and prices

  

in the Hunt Boom will remain the
same.

The present alteration program
in Schenley Hall is a stop gap at-
tempt by Terry Milani, Student
Union Manager, and his staff to
fulfill the immediate needs of the
commuting and dormitory stu-
dents. All renovations up to this
point have fallen under present
budget allocations.

"Forethought and planning will
be needed to conceive the best
means to handle student activites
and organizations whether it be a
new student union or the curr_ent
building. Right now we are trying

to maximize the use of the present

an end of the harassment of Black and other minority communities.
We not only demand self-control of the Black community but we fur-
ther demand that Black people be given an equal say in the overall
functioning of our country. We would further curb the excessive
powers'of the presidency and end the illegal Presidential use of war
making powers. We would abolish the FBI and end political‘frame-
ups. We would end the illegal use of eavesdropping. wiretapping
and spying. We would demand a judicial system that is not biased
against working people and the oppressed nationalities. Any other

In—class Film Use Cut

Chairman of the Anthropology De-
partment, said they “try and show
the best films possible . . . the de-
partment needs over 275 hours
of film time this year but funds
have been cut to a point where this
is impossible.“

Dr. Walter H. Everett, Acting
Chairman of the English Depart-
ment, said, “Our department's
small allotment was used up ear-
ly in the term.” He indicated they
had used the budget modification
system to obtain more service.
Everett explained that the Eng-
lish Department has purchased
some of its own equipment, but
still depends on Audiovisual Serv-
ices.

The Foundations of Education
Department is offering a new
course for doctoral students be-
ginning with the Winter Term. It
will be a Nader-like research
team delving into school prac-
tice and policy at every level of
public education. The teams, con-
sisting of students and faculty
will investiage in-depth selected
areas, e.g.: competition in the
classroom, tests and measure-
ments, student/teacher relation-
ships, the effects of behavioral
objectives, the validity of the cur-
riculum, i.e., the action-research
will be value oriented rather than
statistically based. Findings, ob-
servations, and recommendations
will be published. This is not a
seminar course but a true team
research group. The course car-
ries six credits per term, cross

Hiller Blasts NCLC

by KARL BALDYS

"All I want.to know is who in the hell they are." Marc Hiller. head
of Zero Population Pittsburgh. emphatically denied that the National
Caucus of Labor Committees. had challenged ZPP to a public debate
on the problem of unnecessary population.

Last week Mike Micale. publicity man for the NCLC. told the Pitt
News that’his organization was going to challenge ZPP to a debate on
solutions to soaring population growth at a forum scheduled ’l‘liursday.
Oct. 19. However. according to Hiller. no onelat ZPP was notified of
the debate. ’

“The fundamental policy of ZPP is to stabilize population growth
through voluntary action . . . we don’t want to see the government step
in and start legislating what goes on in the bedroom.” Hiller went on
to attack the NCLC. “As far as population growth is concerned, they
don’t know what they're talking about.”

The NCLC claimed that fusion reactors would provide electric
power that could be used to help alleviate population pressure. Said
Hiller. "Nuclear power through fusion is no answer. It can‘t solve the
immediate problems of air pollution .  or the starvation of children
every day from lack of food."

Hiller rebuked Micale for labeling ZPP as "a threat to the working
class." He said. "Right now were fighting the Atomic Energy Com-
missions attempts to build nuclear reactors that are dangerously pol-
luting. that will effectively harm the people who live nearby. the work-
ing people he (Micale) is so concerned about.“ ’

Hiller also cited studies done by “. . . a, totally private research
group at MIT, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation,” endorsing the
planned voluntary control of population growth. He also mentioned
a Congressional committee that came to the same conclusion, only to
have their report thrown out by the President.

"We stand for more than just zero population growth." Hiller con-
tinued. "We believe in the rights of women to have control of their own
bodies . . . through the liberalization of abortion laws and by making ma-
terial on contraception available." ’

Hiller claimed that the NCLC and Micale  S. . knows less about nu-
clear physics that I do . .  but aded that his group would rather bring
experts like Dr. Ernest Sternglass. a professor at Pitt who is noted for

. his work on nuclear radiation. to debate the issue. if indeed there was
~— to be a debate. *

 Administration Endangers
 Civil Rights

 

, I by JAMES PROZZI
‘ - _‘College Young Democrats

At‘ the Republican Conven-
tionin Miami Beach in August,

. a POW wife who feels deeply

about the Vietnam war rented a

 room at the Hotel Fontainebleu.

 

:1’.

._’, ,

.1 I

"'"i wished.

She’ took an ad out in the local
paper, telling the people to write
tojthe President about the war.
She also said she would be in
her. room to talk to anyone who
would be interested.

Funny things happened when

' people. tried to phone her at the

hotel. Some were told there was
no- such person there. If people
refused to answer whether or not
they were calling about the ad,
they were refused also. Some-

r , how, not many callers got through.

When asked about this, a hotel of-

‘ficial spoke of “security”. This

POW wife now plans to sue the
Republican Party, the hotel, and
the FBI on the grounds that they
monitored her calls. She says:'
.5"If asking people to write to the
President is a danger to security.
then somebody around here doesn't
want democracy." ‘ t
‘ When one speaks of the assault
on our liberties, one could, if he
talk about the revela-

"’ ‘. tions of the Army's surveillance

of» private citizens. Or he could
talk about how agents were sent

 ,-I to spy on ecology rallies. Or how

' the administration combatted the

lawlessness of Mayday withits
; own lawlessness—unconstitution-

 al mass arrests and detention of
‘- g guilty and innocent alike. Or of

' Subversive

the attempts toiresuscitate that
throwback to McCarthyism, the
Activities Control

 Board. Or of the practice of

dragging people before grand
juries .investig'ating anti.-war ac-
tivities. granting them immunity
from prosecution, and then jail-
ing them for contempt if they re-
fused to engage in such a “fish-
ing expedition”. Or one could
talk of the "model" crime bill.
with its “no-knock" provisions
and its provision for detention
of "dangerous" persons. Howev-
er. as sad as it may seem, these

come off as relatively minor com- -

pared the abyses of some other

areas of individual rights.

One area is wiretapping. In
1967 the Supreme Court ruled
that wiretapping wasa “search"
in terms of the Fourth Amend-
ment. and was unconstitutional
without a judicial warrant. In
1968 Congress_made.. provisions
for the issuance of these war-
rants. But instead of going to
the courts, Nixon and Mitchell
bugged phones for 31/2 years on
their own authority, claiming
that the President. as command-
er in chief and head of the
government. was entitled to tap

when necessary to protect the

government. His claim originally
was, incredibly. enough, that
neither Congress nor the courts
could deny him this right. Well
last June 29. the Supreme Court.
with Nixon's "law and_ order"
justices agreeing. unanimously
rejected this claim of the admin-
istration as unconstitutional.

But the damage done by this
practice seems extensive, al-

‘ though has in so many other areas

in which the Administration is
involved, no one can tell for
sure. However since the decision
in June, the Justice_Department
has chosen NOT to proceed with
a heretofore important case rath-
er than to disclose the facts of
its wiretapping. It-has, in recent
months, dropped its perjury case

.against the alleged Capitol bomb-

er Leslie Bacon, its contempt
charges against Bobby Seale, and
its contempt case against four
Vietnam Veterans who refused
to testify before a grand jury in-
vestigating anti-war activities.

Another area of great gravity
is the Administration’s attitude
toward the First Amendment
rights of the press and publishing.
Its attempts to suppress the Pen-
tagon Papers on the grounds of
“prior restraint” is unprecedent-
ed. What is more ominous is its
extraordinary step of harassing
the Beacon Press, a respected
publishing house, for publishing
a text of the Pentagon Papers
after the government had issued
ITS version.

Now the claim of a "news-
man’s privilege” to keep sources

Editor's Note: This is the fifth
in a series of eight debates on
current campaign issues by the
College Young Republicans, the
College Young Democrats and
the Hall-Tyner-Henderson Cam-
paign ( Communist Party).

The debatesuwill appear every
Wednesday in this space until
the election.

The opinions expressed in these
articles are those of the individ-
ual writers and do not necessari-
ly reflect official party positions.

The topic for today's discussion
is civil rights.

confidential has been recognized
by statute in several states. But
.\‘ixon's new majority on the Su-
preme Court recently refused to
grant reporters total immunity
l'rom questioning. And it has also
ruled that Senator Mike Gravel is
not protected by the constitution-
al shield for a federal legislators
"speech and debate" and has rul-
ed that he may be questioned
about his sources of information
for the Pentagon Papers. The
most disturbing aspect of both of
these cases is that there is no
distinction made between one‘s
rights before a grand jury. which
is an arm of the prosecution. and
before a judge at a full trial.

The Columbia Journa-
lism Review puts it bluntly:
"If Mr. Nixon is re-elected. his
options are obvious. Given a six-
or seven-justice majority. a .\ix-
on Court can apply a strait-jack-
et that can inhibit. if not immo-
bilize. news coverage for a gen-
eration. if not longer."

For all these reasons. the out-
look for individual libert_y must
be regarded as a fundamental is-
sue in this election campaign.
And as the B-52 in the White
House has said in a rare em-
brace of accuracy. there has been
no clearer division on funda-
mental issues in any Presidential
campaign in this century than
now exists. For George McGov-
ern supported the First Amend-
ment right of papers to publish
the Pentagon Papers: He op-
posed the widespread electronic
surveillance and FBI and Army
intelligence files on civilians. He
believes that the government.
in protecting the- majority of
its citizens. must not do so by
ignoring the rights of the_min-
ority.

Forbes Avenue Deadman’s Curve

let someone out to buy a pack of cigarettes. and
blocks the whole lane.“ ‘

By BILL SMITH
On your mark, get set. charge!
. A Sound familiar?

Traffic Policeman: “It’s giving rise to a New

No. it is not the opening of _a Bengal. Lancers

frerun. nor the start of a track and field event.

These are _the words that are sometimes shouted

liby clusters of students prior to dashing across

Forbes Avenue from the Common Facilities Build-

ing. ' ‘ ’
The challenge is to make it safely across

“Dead Man's Curve” by avoiding four lanes

. f of high speed outbound traffic. -

The one way traffic system on Fifth and
Forbes was initiated on June 18. for a two

g month trial period.

‘Since the end of the experiment period. the

' question of whether to continue this mode of traf-

fic flow has comefoefore City Council twice. and
been tabled as many times. It is now due to come
up again this week.

Being curious to know how the people felt in
the area involved. I asked sortie of them how they
would vote on the issue, and why.

Following are the opinions of a number of
people most affected by the new pattern of traf-
fic flow:

Cab Driver: "1 think it’s a good thing. It
moves traffic better except when people block the
intersections. Oakland Avenue was backed up
worse before because there was no traffic light:
, now at least a few cars can get through."

-Bus Driver: "It's bad down around the Cha-
tham Center district, but it’s good when you get
out» around here (Oakland). It's not too good for lo-
ealtraffic, especially during rush hours. For in-

» _sta_nc__e. when a passenger car stopsand parks to

 

York driving attitude. If , you're a pedestrian,
when that light turns red, then you’d better get
off the street. It has its good and bad points!”

Local Merchant: “I‘d vote to put it back. I
don’t know. but you seem to hear more gripes
now. Some local merchants have lost business.
The feeder streets seem to back up more now.
This system worked fine until school opened.
then there was too much-traffic.“

Coed Commuter: "I think it‘s great. don‘t you"?
It makes everything so much faster and easier.

"I'm from New York, and I just love driving in

Pittsburgh." . . . . . . . ..Hmmm!!

Well. there we have the tally. Three pro. one
con. and one non-commital.

As for myself, in the last three and a half
months, I’ve seen a nurse hit by a car that'was
making a wide sweep onto Forbes from Atwood;
witnessed numerous close calls, and one success-
ful collision at the intersection of Bigelow and
Forbes; clocked several possible ,world records on
the Fifth Avenue dragstrip from Atwood to Mc-
Kee; and noticed illegally parked cars still block-
ing the'curb lanes regardless of tickets dutifully
placed on their windshields during the rush hours.

And. so far as alleviating congested traffic
conditions. I. for one. still find ample time to com-
plete a night's reading assignment while sitting
on the bus from Halket Street to the Cathedral of
Learning.

Hopefully. City Council will arrive at a deci-
sion at its next meeting that will satisfy the safe-
ty and convenience of everyone involved.

Equal Opportunity
For Everyone

By LYNN J. ALSTADT
College Young Republicans
A free and open American society, one that is true to the ideals
of its founders. must _five each of its citizens an equal chance at
the starting line and an equal opportunity to go as far and as high

as his talents and energies will take him. Our nation can be proud .

of the progress that it has made in assuring equal opportunities for
members of minority groups in recent years. President Nixon has
vigorously sought an end to minority discrimination and has achiev-
ed some admirable results.

Since 1969 we have virtually eliminated the dual school system

in the South where Blacks attending all black schools: today only 9'; .

are attending schools that are entirely black. Nationally. the number
of 100 percent minority schools has decreased by 70 percent in the
last three years. ,

Progress has been made to allow American Indians to determine
their own future without federal paternalism. A newly reorganized
Bureau of Indian Affairs, .with almost all-Indian‘ leadership, is
concentrating its resources on a program of reservation-by-reserva-
tion development. Several Spanish speaking Americans have assum-
ed high government positions. The President also created the Cab-
inet.’ Committee on Opportunities for Spanish speaking Americans to
assist this minority group.

Recognizing that a woman should have the freedom to choose
whatever career she wishes. the Nixon Administration has moved vig-
orously against job discrimination based on sex. President Nixon has
appointed twice as many women to top jobs as did both Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson combined.

Yet. in all his appointments. President Nixon rejected a quota
system believing that the most qualified individual ought to be
chosen for the job. Just as no person should be denied a job because
of sex. race or ethnic origins: so too. should no individual be given a
job solely because he is a member of a minority. This view of
getting “the best person for the job" sharply contrasts with the arbi-
trary quota system created by the McGovern Commission for the
Democratic national convention.

President Nixon strongly opposes busing school children to
achieve racial balance, while Senator McGovern has clearly stated
that he is for it. In March, 1972, President Nixon proposed the Equal
Educational Opportunities Act‘, not the school bus, as the means for
improving the education of low income and disadvantaged pupils.
It provides for better trained teachers, improved school facilities,
and scholarships for disadvantaged students.

President Nixon believes that every American ought to have the
opportunity to go as far and as high as his own capabilities allow.-
He has done muchto achieve equal opportunities for all Americans
while rejecting simple formulas (such as the bus or the quota» to
solve our complex social problems.~The President believes in the
American people. He deserves your support.

Nixon, McGovern
Fail on Civil Rights

By NANCY BITENSKY
HALL - TYNER - HENDERSON
Campaign Committee

The question‘ of civil rights in the United States is in severe
danger as a result of the racist. reactionary onslaught of the Nixon
administration. Contrary to the program and thinking of progressive
elements in our society. the Nixon administration would like to not
only dismantle civil rights and the gains made in the civil rights
era. but would choose to dismantle human rights as well. In fact.
it is safe to assume that Mr. Nixon and his noted corrupt adminis-
tration would prefer to see the unchallenged right of the minority
to continue its rule over the majority. '

An‘ example of this can be found in the four years of the Nixon
administration in which drug addiction doubled. property crimes
doubled. in which we had the frame-ups of political leaders such as
Angela Davis. and in which the racist. genocidal. and barbaric war
against the Vietnamese people has drastically escalated.

There is also the new attempt by the Nixon administration to
try to turn back the gains made in the struggle for Black liberation.

 Q

Nixon's idea of civil rights is inequality in education, the elimin- A

ation of job quotas for non-white minorities, and drastic reduc-
tions in the funds for so called urban renewal.

For the first time in our country's history a President has cam-
paigned for re-election on what can be considered an open platform
of racism.

If re-elected.’ we can expect from the Nixon mis-administratioii.-

new drives of reaction. new assaults on living standards of working
people and an even ‘higher percentage of unemployment. The de-
feat of Mr. Nixon in 1972 is essential for peace. freedom and the
security of our land. Unfortunately. his Democratic opponent. the
Senator t'rom South Dakota. offers few. if any. real alternatives to the
existing situation. Mr. McGovern somehow naively assumes that he
can wine and dine with the right and sleep on the floorbeside the
bed of the left. McGovern has vacillated onumany key issues parti-
cularly on welfare. the Mideast question and the wage freeze. These
unveil him as being very much a part of the problem. His open cap-
itulation- to racism. clearly expressed by his numerous visits to
the bed of George Wallace. further testify to where Mr. McGovern
really stands on civil rights. The Democratic and Republican parties
both seem to be more interested in so-called "states" rights than they

are in civil or human rights.
The program of the Communist Party calls for the immediate

Press Distorts Governance Study

STJTEMEIVT BY WILLI.-IM RE.»I
(.'hm'rmmr, Board of Trmlevx

An article in The Pittsburgh
Press of October 13. 1972 pur-
ported to present the highlights
of a 300—page study of the gov-
ernance of the University of
Pittsburgh. The study. commis-
sioned by the Trustees of the
L'niversity and prepared by Pro-
fessor Holbert N. Carroll of the
Pitt Political Science Depart-

ment. is a scholarly work of con-
T he stu~-

siderable magnitude.
dy was presented to the regular
Board of Trustees meeting on
October 12.

The Trustees of the Unive1‘sit_v
consider the Press’ description of
the study a distortion which has
inaccurately and unfairly injur-
ed the reputation of an outstand-
ing educational leaderland schol-
ar. By selecting points out of
context. the story ma_nage.d to
convey an incorrect‘ impression
that has disturbed everyone who
read the report and heard the
author's briefing on it.

Through a statement he releas-

ed publicly last Friday, Profes-

sor Carroll has undertaken to
correct some of the errors in
emphasis and fact in the PRESS
story.

A remaining concern of the
Board of Trustees of the Univer-
sity is an implication that the

l1as diminished confidence in
the current administration. The
Board takes unqualified excep-
tion to such an implication. The
Trustees overwhelmingly support
and laud Chancellor Posvar‘s
leadership.

Wesley W. Posvar‘ is an out-
standing educational leader. He
has shown himself to be brilliant
in dealing with the problems
of the recent past and creative
in developing new programs and
directions for the University
which have had less visibility
than its problems but are far
more important.

This University is now under
the best financial management
it “has had in half a century. The
University’s budget in this period
has almost doubled. sixteen new
buildings have been added to or
planned for_the University's cam-
puses. the major debt inherited
from the past has been greatly
reduced. annual giving has more
than doubled. and the University

is on the verge of launching a -

$35-million fund campaign which
will add to the excellence of pro-

grams he has fostered. These
achievements are cumulatively
so impressive that they have
drawn frequent high praise from
Trustees and numerous commun-
ity and educational leaders.

We should keep in mind also
that Chancellor Posvar guided
the University through the most
turbulent period in the history of
higher education. With campus-
es in turmoil, Pitt escaped with

only minor disruption and with- '

out losing its forward momen-
tum. Professor Carroll himself
attributes this to “prudent and
flexible” administration.

During this same period. the
Chancellor has re-oriented the
mission of the University to one
of public service and has set the
institution on a course toward
becoming a prototype of the
great urban university. Under
Dr. Posvar‘s administration the
L'niversity has opened the School
of the Health Related Pl‘OfeSSl0tlS.
added new academic centers such
as the one for International
Studies. established new depart-
ments. and undertaken much-
needed innovation and reform in

Notre Dame ran up the score and how the games officials made
ca.lls' conducive to the Irish‘s 42-16 win.
. I ..The University of Notre Dame sits in the middle of a rela-
tiy.ely'.flat city. about,an hour out of Chicago. Saturday after-
noon football ga:nes are the main happening there. a happening
equitable to existence itself. seemingly.

¢'- ,‘ This Saturday. however. the stands of Notre Dame stadium
were graced with the presence of scouts from the Orange
and the Sugar Bowls. ' . _

.. You see, Notre Dame is caught up with a cut throat game,
which comes as a byproduct of having a successful football
program, national rankings and bowl bids. Notre Dame is pre-
sently ranked 7th in the national polls. A loss or a close win
o Pitt would have been a disasterat South Bend, a disaster
equal to the earthquake that shook San Francisdo.

I With’ these facts in mind. it isn't hard to understand why

Nebraska score last week‘?

 Ultimately it was the Pitt defense which gave up the final
Notre Dame scores. The officials however contributed their
. air share to the cause. The record will show that the Irish
jcored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter on route to
9 the 2§ point victory.

A  ’ The record won’t show that Stan Ostrowski was held by
Via.‘ Notre Dame defenseman with Pitt driving for a score early
:_;in- the game. And while everybody in the stadium knew it was
,- holding, Pitt was deprived of a scoring chance, deep in Irish
'te‘rrotiry. The record won’t show that when both John Hogan

 i What is disturbing about this is not that Notre Dame ran
_?up' the score (Pitt should hope who in such a position), but
that the officials stooped to that lowly level and the Parse-
gian denied the stragegy after the game was over. -

 A very dejected Pitt News reporter questioned Parsegian
in the locker roo n. C V

left in the game and converted it into its second touchdown. a
.\o'tre Dame fan. who had bet the Irish to win by 33 points

‘blurted out a final obsenity.

The Pitt News reporter would have phrased it different-

'-.~.ly. He would have said. what a cheap way to lose by such a
large margin. '

 
  

 
  

out the afternoon.

“People say I‘ did a pretty good
job at Notre Dame by I don’t feel
I played up to my standards,” said
the Panther gridder. “I was too
conscious of my wrist. I wasn't
doing my job to the fullest extent
possible because I was afraid I’d
fall on my wrist again and be
out more games.”

Webster doesn't feel that his
performance is up to par yet. "I
was pretty good against Florida
State but then I broke my wrist
and now I’m just getting back in
shape." he said.

"Overall I guess my career at

half to play some ball like we
know we can play and through the
third quarter it was a pretty good

game." a good game. The score
certainly doesn't indicate how
we played."

With a 0-6 record game morale
is difficult to maintain for any
team, but Webster still sees hope
for the Panther squad.

"It's hard to maintain spirit with
a record like ours but I hope a
win can get us back.“ remarked
the Pitt star.

While Webster would like to
see Pitt do well the rest of the
season. he also has some personal

“I’d like to make All-American
but I don’t know if I can do that
because I'm practically. unknown
to the pros,” be related. “I’d also
like to break into some post sea-

can.

"Mainly. though. I'd just like
to stay‘ healthy. That would be
great."

 

Parsegian chose to run up‘ the score. Did anybody hear the ‘

Pitt has been OK." Webster con-
tinued. “But it hasn't brought
the fruits I thought it would—but
l‘l. wait and see in the pro draft
if I get drafted high or not.“

A professional football career
is something that the Panther star
is really looking forward to.

"Ithink I‘ve got a pretty good
chance to make it in the pros.“
related Webster. "I had a good
pre-season rating (the pro scouts
ranked hi:n the fifth best offen-
sive guard in the nation) but I
don’t know how I stand now.

 

"Besides. who wouldn‘t want
to make all that money doing’
something you like and not reall_v_
thinking‘ of it as work?"

Although a possible profession-
al football career looks promising,
Webster is still concentrating on
his last year at Pitt.

"We have the potential but we‘ve
had so many mistakes." Webster
commented. "The breaks haven't
been going our way."

"In the Notre Dame game I
thought we had it for a moment
like everyone else thought." he
said. "We came out the second

"Pitt is like a dry forest waiting to get lit. and
when we do. were going to explode." These are the
words of sophomore safety Mike Bulino. -and they
probably reflect the thoughts of a lot of Panther
gridders. '

"We don‘t have any trouble getting up for the

games." Bulino added. "but when we win our first
game. we'll be so psyched that we'll win the rest of
the games left. and we should beat Boston. College
Saturday." ‘

Bulino is a somewhat unusual thing at Pitt. a
defensive back who was recruited at that position.
"I was a linebacker in high school. but I played a
year of defensive back at Fork Union Military Aca-
demy." noted Bulino.

Bulino won the starting strong safety job the
second week of training camp and has started at
that position every game this year.

"I though I would get my chance around the
middle of the season." he recalled. "It really sur-
prised me to win the job so quickly."

MIKE BULINO tries in vain to help out a teammate as
Steve Harris of Northwestern takes in a pass for touch-
down. ‘ ‘

expectations he hopes to fulfill.

“A Win Will Ignite Us”

SENIOR OFFENSIVE TACKLE Ernie Webster suffered an injury to his wrist
in the very first game of theseason against the Florida State Seminoles.
He was back in action, however by the fourth game when the Panthers
confronted Northwestern.

llllllllllllllllllll|l|lll=-E.

Bulino was taken out of the Notre Dame game
with a neck injury. but it was not serious and he
will be playing against Boston College on Saturday.

Bulino sets no specific goals for himself, only
to play his zone well and not get caught for a long
bomb. He naturally would like to return an inter-
ception for a touchdown, but doesn’t go out on the
field with this in mind.

Bulino had one interception this year. against

— Tulane. but it turned out to be disasterous. "I was

hit as soon as I caught it." he recalled. "I lateral-
ed it to a teammate. who was hit and fumbled. and
Tulane recovered 20 yards from the original line
of scrimmage." A

Bulino feels that the defense has played pretty
well thisyear. but mistakes have cost them. "With
the schedule we play. we can't afford to make any
mistakes. and it‘s the mistakes and turnovers that
are killing us."

The tough schedule is one of the factors that
lead Bulino to choose Pitt from more than 30 schol-
arship offers that he received. “It’s a challenge to
play these strong teams week after week, and if you
can play for Pitt, you can play for any school.”

Although he is only interested in football. Bu-
lino did play basketball and track in high school. "I
played basketball to keep in shape for track. and I
ran track to keep in shape for football." he laughed.

The strong safety is. among other things. sup-
posed to cut off the runs. around end. Bulino gets a
lot of help in that category from Pitt‘s outstanding
defensive ends. Jim Buckmon. Rod Kirby. and Eric
Knisely.

(C.

On passing plays, Bulino- must first cover his .

zone and then is free to go wherever the pass does.
It was while he was roaming around that Bulino was
outstanding against Notre Dame.

He lead Pitt with 13 tackles. including five
unassisted ones. He did that despite leaving. the
game early because of the neck injury.

Bulino hates to blame Pitt’s 0-6 record on turn-
overs. but the statistics back him up. "We were
right in the Air Force and Notre Dame games until
we started fumbling and getting intercepted." he
points out. "Turnovers are a big part. but I'm real-

_ ly looking forward to winning our next five games."
