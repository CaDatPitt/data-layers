Freshman Club Meets

Friday Freshman Club, sponsored
by the University YMCA. will elect
its president today at the regular
meeting.

All freshmen are invitedto attend
at 12:30 o’clock in the Y club rooms
at Bouquet and Forbes streets.

¢college students should be able to
learn the ‘use of the procedure in a
short time) requires some explana-
tion. The equipment consists of a
pitcher_;of stale wa.ter_(usually seven-

cups. -By carefully tucking your
sandwich, and other groceries in your
mouth or pocket as you reach the
cashier (who hides the water by
standing in front of it) you may, by
careful manipulation of the pitcher,
obtain a, drink by slopping water in-
to a paper cup.
“The American Way,” as one cus-
tomer observed, V“is more or less
made up of a gulped sandwich, half-
chewed, followed by a water rinse.”

“In the Tuck Shop,” he continued,
“the system was being replaced by

This reporter finds that there is
some relief on the part of students
who were worried about the Amer-

RKO Exbcutive
Lauds Players

By Alice Lewis

“Excellent professional-like enter-
tainment” was the way Arthur Willi,
head of the talent department of
RKO Radio pictures described the
Pitt Players production, “Three Men
on a Horse” as he watched a rehear-

night at the Foster Memorial.

While commenting on the action
and dialogue of all the players in
general, Mr. Willi singled out one
member of the cast for special atten-
tion. Betty Weghorst, Ed41, playing
the role of Mabel, has “exceptional
talent and “ﬁne photographic.quali-
ties,” the talent scout says.

Offering her a screen test, if after
two years she should wish to enter
the professional acting ﬁeld, he ad-
vised: “Finish your education ﬁrst;
I don’t believe in taking anyone out
of school, since A
chance in a thousand that a person
will click after a preliminary screen
test.”_ , =
Mr.’ Willi promised to send her a
script from the stage and screen pro-
duction, “Stage Door,” and said that
on his next visit to Pittsburgh he
would hear her read it. I
Expressing a regret that he would
be unable to attend the opening night,
Mr. Willi complimented Buell_ White-
hill, assistant professor of English on
his direction of the Players’ ﬁrst at-
tempt of the year.’

“I like the way you urge members
of the cast to give their own inter-
pretations of the roles,” the Scout
said. “In most college theatricals
the students act like puppets in the
hands of a director who hypnotizes
them from the back of the audito-
rium.”

“Three Men on a Horse” will play
tonight for the last time. Curtain
rises at 8:15 o’clock. Single or season
tickets may be purchased at the

Dr. Gray Compares American

Students, Methods With English

By R. X. Hamilton

After working with University;
students for almost a year, Dr. Peter
.Gray, professor of biology, and for-
imer faculty member of the Univer-
sity of Edinburgh, Scotland, believes
that American students and Amer-
!ican educational methods rate much
ihigher than British ones.

Dr. Gray, who took all of his un-
dergraduate and graduate work at
the University of London, said in an
interview this week that “instead of
having two semesters as here, we
there had three terms, each term cov-
ering about twelve weeks. At the
end of each term we were given a
ﬁnal examination covering every-1
thing worked on during that particu-
lar term.” - 

“Classroom methods were the
same as here, but our_periods were
sixty minutes long,” stated Dr. Gray,
“and if you  two classes in suc-
cession you were out of luck, as
there wasno allowance of time for
interclass transit.” '

The two burning issues on Amer-
ican college campuses, football and
ROTC. are about disregarded in Eng-
land, accordingto Dr. Gray. English
,football, is. of course. the fE1mOUS
rugby, and there ispractically no in-
ter-collegiate competition in it, the
games being largely int1‘a-mu1”81-
“The annual classic,” said Dr. Gray.
“is the yearly international match in
which the best amateur players of
England play those of Scotland.”

University corps except that fewer
students take it. It goes by the same
name, but the “R” in ROTC stands
for “Royal.”" There is no controversy
over it. It is entirely voluntary, and
regarded as purely a personal mat-
ter with the student.

. Asked if he were troubled by
American accents, Dr. Gray replied,
“not at all, but my students are some-
times troubled by my English accent.
You know wh.at they say about it,
‘Every Englishman speaks as if he
At
least one American speaks the same
way, for, said Dr. Gray, “I took out
ﬁrst citizenship papers‘ two months
before the ﬁrst_ international crisis,
and l have seen nothing since to
make me" change my mind.” ,

Dr. Gray, who has over thirty-one
graduate students working .-under
him, is here on a Buhl foundation fel-
lowship to do work on development
in the chick,embryo, and is teaching
only because he likes it.

He has inaugurated several in-
novations in the course, ‘including
the publication of a report '50 tl1€
students‘ on each examination. In
the report he gives the answers he
expected, summarizes his method of
grading, and in general discusses
matters that may be of assistance in
helping puzzled students.

His research on the chick embryo
is in an entirely new ﬁeld. Dr. Gray
got an idea for the experimenting
with the effect of heavy metalson the

Dangling Skeletons
And ‘The [load -Back’

Pitt’s athletic skeleton has been exhumed and
dangled before the view of the entire nation by
Francis \Va.llace in his two articles in the Saturday
Evening Post. A ’

Assuming the attitude of the researcher, Wal-

lace uses the situation at the University asa test

case to answer the question, “Is there "a road back
for an American college dissatisfied with the high-
way of high-pressure football play for pay “I”

In his assumption that Pitt ought to supply the
answer to this qiiestion, provided the “present” re-
forms” are enforced, Mr. VVallace is basically cor-
rect; Pitt is, after a fashion, on a road back. .,

But it must be pointed out that no one knows
how far alongnthat road Pitt will be able to travel.
If the University intends to schedule games which
will ‘fill the Stadium, it cannot follow a policy of
complete de—e1nphasis, as did VV. & J., or Chicago.

And if Pitt teams, under the Code Bowman,
are not able to compete with teams from other
major schools, the chancellor has stated that he
would consider adjusting the interpretation of the
code to the views of rival schools.

The actual facts of the series of incidents lead-
ing up to Dr. John B. Sutherland ’s resignation as
head football coach, as reviewed by Mr. \7Vallace,
are not clear. As long as there are two sides to
that unfortunate incident, there will be controversy
 to what actually happened.

The investigating committee of the Board of
Trusteees stated the opinion of nearly everyone
associated with the University when it labeled Dr.
Sutherland ’s resignation as “a distinct loss to the
University,” and declared that the change in ath-
letic policy had been made “so abruptly that un-
necessary controversy was created.”

Dr. Sutherland is gone now; the open ﬁghting
about Pitt’s athletic policy has died out, at least
temporarily. But Pitt is only part of the way
along “the road back,” and many changes are
likely before our test case is closed.

F1-om F1-iek to Foster
Hall and Broadway

Last night at the Foster Memorial Pitt Players
opened the 1939-40 season with the Holm-Abbott
farce, “Three Men, on a Horse.” From all ac-
counts theplay is a riot.

Every year it seems the Players become more
ambitious. For the second time they are enlarg-
ing their usual program of three plays, mostly be-
cause of the success with which “Our Town” was
greeted last May. \Ve hope that all four plays
this year are as good as that was.

Things have changed a lot since we were fresh-
men. Pitt Players productions in those; days were
consigned to the unsatisfactory facilities of the
"stage at Frick elementary school. Rehearsals were

held in a diml_v—lighted bare-brick room somewhere P

in the Catliedral. Now, performances and many of
the rehearsals are run through in Foster Memorial.

Also, though this may be only our impression,
the choice of plays has taken a new turn. Last
year, “Brother Rat” and “Our Town” reached
the University soon after they closed in New York.
And look at the list scheduled for this year:
“Three Men on a Horse,” which you’vc probably
either already seen or are going to see; “Counselor-
at-Law”; “Adding-Machine”; and “You Can’t
Take it \Vith You.”

A lot of credit, we think, is due Buell \Vhite-
hill, director of the Players, who is now in his third
year at the University. VVe can’t help hoping, of
course, that at least some of his success has been
due to the material with which he has worked.

All in all, we ﬁnd the Players a great organiza-
tion and one which every student should support.
Here's wishing them lots of luck for the year.

, \Ve notice that the debaters are going to argue
a queston with some Englishmen. VVe think this
1S a very ﬁne idea. In fact, we think any inter-
course with the English will be good for a group

that will put on their advertising signs “Hear

who sunk the Athenia.”

The ground floor elevator lobby seems strangely
quiet these days since the publicity committee of the
Screwball Hop quit operating . . . Incidentally, enough
praise cannot be given the Sophs for putting over a
T8311)’ classy dance. Among the celebrities in attend-
ance were Dean of Men Lanfear, Dr. Sam Williams,

Conspicuous by his absence was Bill Daufenbach, vet-

Our Boy Fullerton

Since gorgeous Marion Wollett entered the air

betting that all the Panther athletic teams insist on
ﬂying to their games from now on. Hey coach, when
do we leave . . .

If you want to see something funny drop into the
Panther oﬂice almost any afternoon and take a gander
at the three Snoops (Johns, Brennan, and DeLeo)
hatching up their gossip column for the humor mag.
Their stuff actually amuses them . . .

Three freshman lads for whom we predict big things
here at Pitt are Jack Wynn, McKeesport tennis star,
Gus ’Wilde, handsome Apollo from South Side, and Bob
Sullivan of Bellevue, recently selected to lead the Frosh
shindig. You gals will do well to add them to your list
of boys you must meet . . .

rolet seen speeding from the direction of Trees gym

Idle thought: It would be a swell idea if all the
Pitt students would send a card or a letter to Dick

that they know class when they see it . . .

For Pittpourri’s Hall of Fame this week we select:
Mary Gregg, pretty senior who hails from Peabody high
school and who now calls ‘Penn Township her home.
Besides being Co-ed Major of ROTC, a member of Mor-
tar Board, Publications Board, Chief Justice of Senior
Court, Cwens, SFA, and sophomore class secretary, she
was also on the Heart Hop, Junior Prom, and Spring
Festival committees. Popular Mary is a good student
in spite of all her activities . . .

Jack Hoeveler, Independent party leader and busi-
ness manager of the Pitt Panther gets our vote as one
of Pitt’s outstanding students. Besides being a mem-

ber of ODK, vice-president of SFA, member of the,

Executive committee, star of three Cap and Gown
shows and several Pitt Players productions, Jack was
also a Junior Worthy, president of Druids, and pub-
licity chairman of a Frosh dance. He is well known
around school for his clever jokes and ready wit . . .

We have a friend who is in love. This friend
dropped in on us the other night and for one hundred
fifty-nine minutes and thirty-seven seconds subjected
us to an impassioned declaration of his beloved’s beauty.

Being of a. philosophical turn of mind we got to medi-

tating on the subject, and after our friend left, we
leaned back and asked of the circumambient atmos-
phere, “What is Beauty?”

A worm stuck his head out from one of our books
and said, “A thing of is a joy forever.” We
quelled the disturber with a shotgun and returned to
our meditations.

Slowly there crept into our mind (strange how

everything creeps slowly into our mind) the recol- ‘

lcction of a conversation on this subject between us
and a Mexican cowboy friend of ours.

We were riding through the brush about six feet
north of the border, down Mexico way, when our
friend stepped out from behind a clump of‘ brush,
jabbed a riﬂe in our stomach, and said, “Altos manos

. . oh, hola, Sordo, how goes it?” “First rate,” we
said, unrufﬂed, having heard rumors about our hon-
est vaquero friend, “Since when have you under-
taken this business of robbing honest travellers like
myself?” “Since I acquired a sweetheart,” answered
Pablo, “For what other reason would I risk my life
thus than to secure money to buy her trinkets?”

As we are something of a conﬁrmed bachelor, this
logic didn‘t get across. “Leave her then, feito mio,” we
replied, “Go back to honest work with the cows.” “Ah,
but senor, she is beautiful,” said Pablo, sadly, and
launched into a description. '

“Two lips she has, and red, red as chile peppers and
as warm. She has two eyes, two shell-like ears. And
her hair! She has hair senor, and it is long. And of
the teeth she has thirty-six!” (Where he acquired this
last item of information I don’t know. Perhaps his
dulce corazon counted them one bright moonlit night as
he serenaded her and passed the knowledge on to him)
“And senor, her nose, she has a nose . . ”

“Yes, yes,” we interrupted, “I know, amigo mio,
she has one whole nose, all her own, therefore she is
beautiful. Doubtless she also possesses two hands and
two feet. A paragon of beauty.”

“You jest with me, E] Sordo,” said Pablo sadly,
“but, senor, have you ever seen a woman who has
lost her nose?”

So we rode back to camp and philosophically ate
a becfsteak to strengthen us. '

In On Players’
Last Rehearsal

By Nancy Welfer

Walls were pushed into place,
worried lines appeared on youthful
faces, the cash-register in the bar
rang up another $3, and the dress
rehearsal for “Three Men on a
Horse,” was almost ready to start.

Down in the hall by the dressing-
room in Foster Memorial, actors al-
ready in makeup gathered around
benches and practised Bronx accents.
Frankie, the shortest of the three
men, held his head stiff while one
of the make-up girls drew three
more wrinkles on his forehead.
“Look at Carver,” someone said,
“didn’t I do a marvelous job on him?
He really looks old.” ‘

Up on the stage the last pieces
of scenery for the first act were
being adjusted. Complete sets were
assembled on wheeled platforms,
ready to be shoved into place after‘
each drop of the curtain. On the
one -set the stage-manager held up
a 15-foot wal1—section, edging it
around to the proper angle.

Over in the barroom set the prop— .

posters of pretty-gi-rlsl on» the walls
and then drew mustaches on them.
“Get off the bed,” came a_ shout. f‘It’s
broken already.” ‘ The Jills-of-all-

out front know the lines so well they
seldom bother to laugh at the gags".
Nevertheless, the dialogue must be
paced for pauses after each laugh.

The actors, well-drilled in their
parts by now, went through their
lines with few pauses. Irwin, last
year an aged banker and the town
drunkard, began to compose verses.
The three men disregarded every-
thing the English department had
drilled into their heads.

The rehearsal went on.

The Men's Debating association today
emphatically denied the infamous and
ridiculous slander that the Athenia was
sunk as a publicity stunt for the coming
international debate between Pitt and 0x-
ford next Wednesday. An unolﬁcial source
indicated that circumstantial evidence
pointed at Switzerland because who else
can gain by the destruction of the world

think this is a clever pun, conﬁdentially
we think it is awful.)

Crippled Freshmen
Battle Tech Plebes

In Evening Game

A crippled Pitt freshman grid
team will take the field against the
Carnegie Tech plebes under the
lights at Greensburg, Pa., tonight in
an encounter for charity.

A wave of injuries has left the
yearling team with a weakened first
string and few reserves. Walt Was-
covich, Jimmy Antonelli, Bob Mal-
loy, Johnny Gurczenski, Gene Gom-
bosh, Joe Walker, Jack Heister,
Howard Balma and one or two oth-
ers have various injuries that will
either keep them from playing or
prevent their being in top shape.

The little Panthers are favored to
take tonight’s battle against a light
Tartan eleven. The Tech boys rely
mainly on a passing attack, and
since the Pitt frosh have also been
brushing up on their tossing game,
a spectacular aerial battle may be

in store for the fans.

Editors of I9I6lPitt W’eekly Let
War News Slip into Background  

This is the fifth in a series of articles in which the road to war is traced

as reflected in the Pitt Weekly of 191

4-1918, the forerunner of The News.

The present series attempts to present student attitudes as they existed
during the period that led to the first World War.

By Dorothy Cleland

With the conclusion of the serie
Weekly at the opening of 1916 settled

ing everyday school events to its readers.
background from which the editors had drawn it for a brief moment.

parently they felt that they had done

s of editorials on the war, the Pitt
down to the routine task of present-
The war again faded into the
Ap-
their part by taking some notice of

it; and further
necessary.

Again during this period of war-
opinion formation the editors came
to the defense of the “radical” ele-
ment of the University and of the
country in general. A January 5 ed-
itorial said in part, “The critical and
radical element in any society is just
as essential, and as much the salt of
savor, as those who do the direct
work of construction.”

Although the students of America
did not feel that the United States
could possibly be drawn into the
war, they were beginning to think a
little about the countries which were
in the War, or, rather, the victims of
the war. Through the exchange col-
umn, in ‘which the editors of the
Weekly reprinted excerpts from other
college papers, University readers
were informed that Carnegie Tech
had launched a campaign for aid for
the European war sufferers, particu-
larly those of Armenia, Poland, and
Belgium.

At this time there was much agi-
tation to promote better relations
with the South American countries.
Among the advocates of this proposal
was Dr. John A. Brashear, a former
chancellor of the University. In a
speech before the students, he urged
them to have a better understanding
with South America. “The citizens
of South America,” he said, “assured
me that they would come to our aid
if any nation of Europe should de-
clare war against the United States.”

It seems that, whether the students
realized it or not, the United States
was slowly acquiring a case of jit-
ters. In keeping with the general
idea of rearmament was a “prepar-
edness test” by the University wire-
less and the Rock Island arsenal.
This test consisted of sending mess-
ages by wireless from Rock Island
arsenal to the University’s station,
the purpose of which was “to demon-
strate the practicability of wireless

communication in time of war.”
Discussion of arbitration and al
world police power continued to ap-

comment was un-9

“Sometimes a group of men will sit

around a table and draw up a treaty
of peace for the European nations.
In this work America has the oppor-
tunity to play an important part.”

He advocated an international
court and council. Nations, he ex-
plained, would agree not to declare
war until the court had given its de-
cision. If any nation should declare
war, the other nations would all go
to war against her.‘

Charity Fund
Driveto Begin

Campaign at University

Aims for $10,000 Goal

Seventy-ﬁve per cent of the stu-
dent pledges to the Community

fund will be devoted to student wel-
fare projects, J. G. Quick, director of
the University Community Chest
drive, announced as he outlined
plans for the campaign.

Each student will be asked to
come prepared with one dollar on
Monday or Tuesday, November 20
or 21, to contribute to the student
drive, which will be arranged by Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men,
and a corps of student workers.

The University has again been
asked to contribute $10,000 to the
$2,650,000 county-wide Community
fund campaign this year, Mr. Quick
stated. This amount, less the 75
cents of every student dollar, will be
given to the general fund.

Each student-contributed dollar
will be further distributed in the fol-
lowing way: YMCA and YWCA, 20
cents each; men’s and women’s stu-
dent loan ‘funds, 15 cents each; and
Lingnan university, “Pitt in China,”
ﬁve cents. -

The student drive will be concen-
trated on two days, Monday the third
hour and Tuesday the second hour.
Faculty pledges will be taken during

pear now and then. The March 1
Weekly carried the account of an ad-
dress by Dr.'G. W. l\[asmyth, then
president of the Federaton of Inter-
national Polity Clubs, and director
of the World Peace foundation.
discussed “America’s Leadership in
the New World Policies.”

Saying that before long a world
police power would enforce interna-
tional law, Dr. Nasmyth added,

A Common Need

Study” have been distributed to
men’s orientation classes by members
of Phi Eta Sigma, honorary scholastic
fraternity for freshmen, Robert Bot-
kin, C42, president, reveals.

Realizing the importance of schol-
'arship in college life and anticipat-
ing demands for new adjustments
and habits, the authors of the book-
let have included suggestions for im-
proving the study habit of both up-
perclassmen and freshmen.

Among rules set forth in the
pamphlet are:

“HaVe a regular place for study
in which you will be free from inter-
ruptions. Keep your desk cleared for
study action.

“Budget your time. If you are
forced to do outside work, carry only
as many subjects as you can ade-
quately master. A

“When you study, concentrate.
Read silently since your lip cannot
keep pace with your eye. Recite es-
sential points to yourself.

“Use a large notebook in note-tak-
ing. Don’t be a court reporter; write
less and think more. Memorize ma-
terial which you expect to use.

“In theme writing choose a subject
which is interesting to you, outline a
plan and revise the theme several
times before presenting it.

“Since examinations are more than
a passing fad, prepare properly for
them. Review your notes daily and
don’t cram an entire semesteris work
into a few hours. Get plenty of
sleep, take the test, and answer the
questions completely.

“Good health, mental and moral-—
is essential for pro-per studying. Take
‘advantage of the University Health
Service when necessary.”

photograph has never been used be-
fore.

Students and faculty can obtain
their cards from members of the

experimenting with the effects of
electricity on the chick. He brought
his idea with him to the University
and has, in less than a year, devel-
oped an entire laborary devoted to
the work, invented several new tech-
niques, and at present has thirty-
one graduate students assisting him. v

The method used is to cut opengan
egg, inject the embryo with a metal,
and place the egg in an incubator;
The effects of various metals are
studied, and thus the students are
given some idea of the role played
by various substances in develop-
ment.

“Unfortunately,” said Dr. Gray,

“we have some absent-minded stu-
dents in the lab who occasionally
forget their eggs are in the incuba-
tor, and so far we have hatched out
six ﬂuffy unscientiﬁc chicks.”
