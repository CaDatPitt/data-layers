SG B member‘

resigns post

By Louise Marshall and
Michael Weinman '
The Pitt News

In yesterday’s Student Govern-
ment Board meeting a motion was
passed to accept the resignation of

‘board member James Haug. Haug,

a junior political science major,
turned in his resignation to the
board, but failed to show up at the
meeting. The resignation simply

read, “I resign, James Haug."

“The position of a board member
should be taken seriously by all peo-
ple, especially people who are run-
ning for the position now,” said
board member David Pikovsky.

According to Pikovsky, Haug had
missed five board meetings since he
was installed as a member last Janu-
ary. A board member can miss a
total -of three board meetings. After
the third absence the board member
may be brought before the SG'B on
impeachmentcharges. According to
Pikovsky, Haug was given the cho-
ice of resignation or impeachment.

“We, as a board, felt he hasn’t
done his job. We were very dissatis-
fied with his work. He was never
around and never worked on any of

. his platforms," said Pikovsky.

“I feelno guilt over what-Iidid,”
contended Haug when reached later

‘in a telephone interview. Haug said

that it was inevitable thatjhe would

leave the SGB, and said SGB Presi-

dent Ken Stram had told him .an
impeachment would “drag this thing

out.” The quickest solution offered

by Stram was for Haug to simply

resign. .
When asked to comment on th

charges, Haug said that he did not‘

fail to fulfill his duties. “Let’s face it,
the main thing the SGB does is allo-
cate money,” said Haug, referring to
$300,000 allotted to the SGB for dis-
bursal. “During the budgetary
period I worked as hard as, if not
‘harder than, anyone else up there.
And after that, I’ll admit, I grew dis-
illusioned and lost interest.”

Haug said that although he can
account for several of his absences,
claiming _he was busy with other
school and fraternity activities, he
said there may have been a deliber-
ate action to get him off the board.
He said board member Avery
Abrams was blackballed from his
fraternity, the Pika fraternity.

“I‘m willing to let the whole thing
just die,” said Haug. “I have more to
live for than the SGB.”

The vote to accept his resignation
was called by SGB member Pam
Hart, who was substituting for Pres-
ident Ken Stram while he attended a
Board of Trustees meeting. The

V motion was passed unanimously.

“We wanted to make an example
of Jim. We wanted to make a point
that an elected person should be
committed [to their position,]” said
Pikovsky. .

Applications for the position of
board member will .be available and
are open to all students. The current
board members will be interviewing
applicants for the position next
week. I

Some cheerleaders and Golden Girls    

By Kathy Campbell

I The Pitt News

The women who cheer for the Pitt
football team have a problem that
rarely affects the men on the grid-
iron. Both the men and women train
for monthsand practice "hard, but
women have one more difficult step.

Once a week for some and twice a
week for those on the‘ Golden Girls

squad, they must step on a scale. If’

they are not within certain weight
requirements, they are banned from
that week’s game. _ -
The official reason for the strict
weight requirements is that the male
cheerleaders have to be able to lift

their female counterparts for cheer- -

leading drills and tricks.

But some of the female cheerlead-
ers, who asked not to be named, said
the weight limits apply only to
women. They also have strict limita-
tions on hair and makeup and are

Reagan Youth

Presidency?

———-Inside Today
“President” Posvar

Why do so many young voters support the Reagan‘

not permitted to wear nail -polish.
And the Golden Girls are ordered to
keep their hair at shoulder length.

“It is necessary to maintain weight
control for appearences,” conceded
one cheerleader, “but if I’m a little
overweight I can’t cheer. They tell us
that’s how a guy can lift us. But they
don’t stop a guy from cheering if he
can’t lift.” '

Two years ago, similar weight
requirements’\forced a Ringgold
High School majorette off the field.
Peggy'Ward, then 15, weighed I30
pounds and _was 5-4. Her coach
insisted that she slim down ‘to I26
pounds. . .

The dispute attracted national
attention when Ward "decided to
fight her exclusion in a lawsuit
before the. state Human Relations
Commission. After going down to
128 pounds‘ and receiving a doctor’s
note, Ward returned to the field.

But she quit the squad after the
season largely over the remaining
hard feelings from the weigh-in ﬂap.

This past February, the Ringgold
school board formally abolished the
weight requirements and issued an

« apology to Ward.

' When asked what she thought of
having to be weighed for each game,
0n€Golden Girl replied, “I think it's
ridiculous. They don’t take anything
like bone structure or water weight
gain from your period into consider-
ation. They make a big deal ifyou're
half a pound overweight.”

If the girls are overweight, they
lose their priviledge of marching at
the games.

Asked why they must weigh in,
one girl said: “They wantus to look
uniform on the field + all the same
size.

One Golden Girl described a typi-

'cal scene before weigh-in as girls run

up and down steps to rid themselves
of any wat_er weight (through perspi-
ration) and take water pills. Some
girls’literaIly starve themselves for a
day or two before their weights are
checked in an attempt to ‘make the

weight. “This can cause problems in
classes,” explained the majorette.
“because you get so weak from not
eating.”

The Pitt cheerleaders, along with
the Golden Girls, go through rigor-
ous training ‘in preparation for the
season just as the Panthers do. The
squad, which is picked initially in
February, must train prior to and
during the season, which begins" in
September. This training includes

drilling of routines and learning the »

proper techniques for lifts, etc. ‘But
perhaps the most grueling aspect of
training for some of the girls is the
diet. '

In order for them to be able to
march with the band or cheer for the
team, they must meet the required
weight. Therefore, the Golden Girls
weigh in twicea week during the
season. The cheerleaders weigh in

once a week.
In an agewhere most women are

susceptible to eating disorders such
as bulimia or anorexia, constant

checks on weight can be detrimental.
Dr. George Hsu, a nutrition expert
at the Western Psychiatric Hospital,
believes this to be true for some indi-
viduals. “People who emphasize
weight, such as models and gym-
nasts,” states Hsu, “are 10 times
more likely to get either anorexia or
bulemia. It is very well-documented
that anyone who diets for a long
length of time usually ends up with
an eating disorder. These disorders
can also, in the long run, result in
mental problems.”

The question remains as to why _

the girls must weigh in. Michael
Nuzzo, assistant coach for the cheer-
leaders, explained, “The girls are
lifted by guys. If they are too heavy,
they can hurt the guys.” Nuzzo feels
thatif the girls’ weights are not con-
stantly watched, they can gain too
much and make for difficult lifts.
The reason why the men’s lifting
ability is not checked is, according to
Nuzzo, “because dead weight is a lot

Title

The Pitt campus has grown by yet
another building.

At yesterday’s meeting of the
Board of Trustees, the board
unanimously approved a resolution
authorizing the university to enter
into an operating lease and eventu-
ally purchase the Jewish Commun-
ity Center on S. Bellefield Ave.

" The university will spend
$200,000 yearly for renovations over
a l0-year period. ,During that time,
some office space will be leased to
new and existing tenants, and uni-
versity offices will “phase into it,”
according to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar. Pitt will have complete
ownership of the building at the end

-of the 10 years. -

The 58-year-old building contains
not only conference and office space
but a swimming pool and gymna-
sium which could eventually be used
“for a faculty facility, or whatever,"
Posvar said.

In other board business:

It was announced that Pitt has
requested $100,643,500 in state
appropriations for the coming ﬁscal
year —'—_ a 15 percent increase from
the amount requested for the current
fiscal year. .

Pitt’_s projected operating budget
for fiscal year 1984-85 is “$356
million. .

lor.” The board unanimously
approved a resolution changing his
title from “Chancellor” to “Presi-
dent” and all other university offi-
cers who currently hold the title
“Chancellor” will also be changed to
“President.” '

While-most state counterpart uni- ‘

versities call_ their chief executive
officers “Chancellor”, most major

universities use the title “President."
With Pitt being an international and
national institution, the change was
made to clear up any ambiguity.

It was announced that more than
2,000 meetings were hosted in the
William Pitt Union in 1984 so far.
The Student Affairs Committee pre-
dicts 3-4,000 to be held in 1985.

Hare Krishna followers enjoy

 

By Carrie Stetler
The Pitt News

The Hare Krishnas had been sit-
ting on the corner of Fifth and
Bigelow for two days, and both days
I pretended not to see them. On the
third day, as I was on my way to
class in the Cathedral, I noticed that
they were giving away some little
cookie—like pastries. Although it
shames me to admit it, I'm the sort of
person who is always quick to grab a
free cheese sample at Hickory
Farms, so I went up to the Hare
Krishnas and asked
cookie.

After I ate it, I spoke to them,

vana Dasi, and became interested

Brehotsloka was born and raised
in Forest Hills, N.Y. which he says
“is a very pious. neighborhood
because there are a lot of strict
Catholics around there.” When he
was only I2, a teenage Hare Krishna
gave him a copy of the Bhagavad-
gita, which he said literally changed
his life. A former Catholic, Brehots-
loka said that he had always been
religiously inclined, “but when I
read the Bhagavadgita, I felt like I

to live in the Krishnaicommunity of
New Vrindabahn in West Virginia.
When he was 19 he went to India,
not only to make a pilgrimage, but
also to study medicine. In the city of
Juhu, he met Sravana Dasi while he
was visiting a Hare Krishna Temple
where she worshipped. Two years
later they were married. I
They lived in India until a month
ago when they decided to come to
Pittsburgh and work as missionaries
distributing literature about their

’ religion; They plan to teach a vege-

tarian cooking class soon. One ofthe
tenets of Krishna consciousness is
abstinence from eating meat and
because of this, over half ofthe peo-
ple who enter the movement are
vegetarians- before they become

involved with the Krishnas. Unsur-_

even approached Sravana to ask,
“You people in India don’t have any
trouble with hypo-glycemia or high
_blood pressure, do you?”
Health-related questions and
friendly curiosity about an unfamil-
iar religion seemed to compel the
students to approach Brehotsloka
and his wife. Occasionally, people
would stop at their table for a theo-
logical debate. About the only hos-
tile reaction to the Hare Krishnas

 

their Pittsburgh mission

Althouth the people that directly
approached Sravana and Brehots-
loka seemed amiable, some of the
people walked by looking disturbed

or embarrassed before glancing‘

away quickly.

Such discomfort might be the
basis ofthe Pitt students‘indignance
at a group of evangelical Bible stu-
dents who told a gathering crowd
that they were going to hell.

Street corner missionaries seem to
annoy a lot of Americans — espe-
cially if theyare militant about their
beliefs, but even, as in the case of
Brehotsloka and Sravana, ifthey are
just sitting at a table distributing
literature. If someone sees a Salva-
tion Army member asking for dona-
tions at Christmas, he or she’s more
than happy to toss them a quarter,
but if someone calls our morals

more agreeable to the public, many
are still suspicious of them and see
them as fanatics intent upon conver-
tinh others.

In a book called Hare Krishna,
Hare Krishna, which discusses this
primarily Indian religion’s growth in
the U.S., there is a quote that seemed
to explain various paranoid reac-
tions to missionaries:

Reagan Youth  

According to The New York Times (Oct. 16), President
Reagan is more popular with young voters than with any other
age group. Recent polls taken by the Times and CBS found that
voters betweenthe ages of 18-24 supported Reagan by 61
percent. It was found that men between the ages of 18-24 favor
Mr. Reagan by 69 percent. Analysts are simultaneously
stunned and fascinated by this sweeping conservative trend
among the young, especially when compared to the skeptical
political attitudes of the l960’s and 70’s.‘

These polls, interviews and surveys indicate that even though
many young Reagan supporters are uncertain about the ulti-
mate success of Reagan’s policies, specifically in foreign affairs,-
they admire the president's character and believe him to be a
strong leader. Reagan presents hope and optimism for those
who are confused or overwhelmed by serious world issues.

There is a sense of national pride today that did not exist
among yesterday’s youth. Nationalism isvback. The advantages
and disadvantages of this nationalistic sentiment can be
debated. Nonetheless, it is here now, and it is strong.

President Reagan seems to personify “the American‘ spirit.”
For many young people, it is not the issues that are most
important but a charismatic leader who will lead them into
better days. This idealism can be seen from fashion to prime-
time TV, from the patriotic lyrics of pop tunes to family values.
It is not simply political but is rapidly becoming cultural in a
broad sense.

People strive for coherence in a problematic world. We need
to unify our perceptions and attitudes in a way that makes sense
to us and allows us to function comfortably. In the process of
doing so, we overlook details and "inconsistencies that require
more attention than we are willing to give in order to compre-
hend them. We simplify and select information to form opin-
ions that we find consistent. ,

President Reagan does this for us in the political arena. He
makes everything understandable and assures us that every-

thing is under control and there’s nothing to worry about. He "

makes us feel good about ourselves and our nation. In an era of

cultural disintegration, the “breakdown of family values” and
the fading of tradition, he provides an inspiring message for .

those who need to hear it. It is unfortunate that so many showa
need for this type of propaganda. ‘

It is propaganda in the sense that it is an organized attempt to I

mold public opinion in the favor of a group or political party.
Attitudes are being shaped and influenced in a subtle way,
through media, through the president’s speeches and through
the efforts of interest groups. It is not a conspiracy and it is not
necessarily an evil thing. It is simply a phenomenon that exists.
Political opinions in the election year are not being developed
in the presence of fact. We must be very cautious about
attempts to influence our opinions through imagistic appeal.

Letters to the

Lukewarm
Socialism

After reading Chris Kramer’s ster-
ling defense of WPTS (The Pitt
News, Oct, 17, 1984), I feel com-

pelled to write. The disease from
which our beloved radio station

.suffers is painfully" epitomized by

Mr. Kramer’s writing style: Italics!
Exclamation points! Enthusiasm!
Yeah! No, Chris, feigned exuber-
ance is no substitute for true creativ-
ity. WPTS is not .innovative in the
remonest sense. 7 '

WPTS seems to’ operate under
some sort of lukewarm socialism:
play what most ofthe students want
to hear most ofthe time, and lop off
anything nasty on either end of the
spectrum. Thus we are bombarded
with continuous mediocrity. Your
“innovations” such as the “Album-
A-Day Giveaway” have nothing to
do with the programming itself.
They are simply gimmicks ofthe sort ’
that the lo.wliest AOR stations churn
out to appease the mushbrains that a
they create (or at least maintain)tin
their listenership.

Playing non-stop requests may
seema noble enough idea in theory
but is, in practice, a surpassingly
stupid one. It's not unusual to tune
in and hear the same song twice, or
even three times, within a two-hour,
stretch. This may seem a minor grie-
vance, but when it’s “Lucky Star”by '
Madonna 

Your disc jockeys, ‘furthermore,-
give an entirely new meaning to the
word “lame.” Obviously. they’re stu-
dents, not professionals, and that’s
how it should be; but it appears that
they are selected on the basis oftheir
“Stepford Wives’? mentality and
their desire to be the next Casey
Casem. They have no genuine pas-
sion for the music that they play.
They are nothing more than oppor-
tunistic go-getters.

Still, Chris, I will leave the most
damning statement t6 you: “But Pitt
has, by nature, a more conservative
student body [than CM U]." Does it
now? The University of Pittsburgh
has 34,000 undergraduates. Can you
honestly say that it is possible‘ to
draw generalizations about the sort
of music to which those people want
to listen? Of course you can’t. Don’t
hide behind the student body tojus-
tify your rationalizations about why
you program the music that you do.

Pop music is an art form. It can be
volatile, innovative and unpredicta-
ble, but always exciting. To censor it
and to attempt to provide standards
for it has ‘been a blasphemy, one
made all the more inexcusable when
a college radio station attempts to
justifyand perpetuate such censor-
ship. College radio is the last bastion
of pub_lic,expression for freedom in

laughable. What WPTS needs is a '

that is not_likely to occur. Ifit does, I
will tipjmy hat to you, Chris. Until
then, I’ll buy themusic that I want to

Pitt Needs Angels

I would like to comment on your
Oct. lS,.l984 articleabout whether
we need or do not need assistance
from the Guardian Angels. I think
the Guardian Angels would be a val-
uable asset not only to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh but also to the
"Oakland area-as well. I

According to your article, there
were 305 acts of crime committed in
Oakland ranging from rape to auto
theft in the month of August alone,
yet Director of Public Safety -Wil-
liam Tucker" was quoted as saying
that there is not a crime problem in
Oakland. Tucker»doesn’t think the
Guardian Angels are needed
because the campus police do a good
enough job. I also feel thatthe cam-

' pus police do a good job, but I also
know that they cannot be every-.

where at once.
I also believe that the campus

police might appreciate the Guard- ‘
, ian Angels’ additional help and sup-

port. The Guardian Angels are a
highly respected group in several
parts of the United States. If they.
were in Oakland this summer and
stopped one‘of the 305 crimes in

' August, wouldn't that be a help?

Macho Nerds

I would like to introduce -the
“Conservative Macho Nerds." We
are a morally founded, politically
based group of protesters who,
believe it or not, find humor in the
Republican platform and therefore,

' exploit it. So, you too are aware that

Mr. Reagan is a silly candidate.
What to do? We have an outlet; take
satire, exploit it, and thus you have
the “Conservative Macho Nerds.”
Our key tool is demonstration, yet
we approach it in a far from classical
manner. First, disguising ourselves

as mild-mannered, wealthy, conser_- ‘

vative suburbanites, we can easily
slip through the Republican “nets”
designed to keep out liberals, the
economically impoverished and
minorities. Next we create a cover
for ourselves by enthusiastically
“supporting” whatever the speaker
has to say: “We won't raise your
taxes  “yeah! yeah!", “no foreign
steel quotas” “yeah!” yeah!”, “war
now"  “yeah! yeah!”, and so on.
Hereicomes the fun part: we

exploit and satirize the silliness .of

the whole damn thing. By a liberal
usage of satire we call attention to
the hypocrisy and injustice of the

‘Republican platform. All at once we

raise our signs and begin to chant
slogans like: “The death penalty for

' fetus murderers” or “white power”, I

or how about “hunger in /America.”I
think you get the idea.
We area conscientious group of

people who realize the dangers of

four more years. ‘We take the candi-
dacy of Mr. Reagan to be insulting.

If you find yourselfin the same boat,’

then you too can become a Conser-
vative Macho Nerd! Keep your eyes
and ears open for when we will strike
next. '

From Where I Stand/ By John Picone

 

Solution in Sight on Traffic Problem

It is time for a very big decision
here at Pitt, one that will affect Oak-
land and the whole city, but one we
can’t be quiet about and let be. We
are all reluctant to take sweeping
actions, from the administration to
the students, but Fifth Ave. is some-
thing that will not take care of itself.
I know how hard it is to take such
big and potentially tumultuous
steps, but the lives of students are at
stake and we’ve got to take that
responsibility into our hands. We all
know -that there will be an outcry
against any proposal Pitt comes up
with to protect people along Fifth
Ave. Newspapers such as Market
Square have already criticized the

M “erection of unnecessary barricades”

along Fifth as a waste of PAT’s and
the city’s money. Market Square
comes to the conclusion that “people
who have not yet learned how to
cross the street probably should not
be going to college.” If there has
been opposition and criticism of the
tiny steps proposed, such as the
rerouting of the 61A and B and the
few yards of railings (steps which are

no more than a Band-Aid on this life ,

and death problem), we know there
will be resistance toward university
recommendations, no matter what
steps are taken to finally solve the
problem.

This is what it finally comes down

to: we can do it now, we can take the‘

big steps to end the danger that has
been present for years_(since the bus-
lane was railroaded into the laps of
the Oakland by the Jim Maloney
administration and City Coucil). We
can do it now because- we have
decided enough is enough and com-
plex sets of circumstances that have
held back the university’s hand for
all these years can no longer stop
Pitt from protecting its» students.
The cost of human tragedy has just
grown too high. Something’skgot to
be done. After years of living with
the constant, unacceptable danger,
after all the conflicts, after the pro-
posal and the waiting, there is clearly
only one path to follow: the buslane
just has to go.

First, I would like to say that the _

university has been very apprecia-

tive to the concerns of which I speak;

and they have been pursuing an

active role in the safety problem. It IS
sad that there is such a great com-
munications problem between the
administration and students. Every
administrator I spoke to was anx-
ious to talk about what could and
was being done, and yet they have
never once gotten any of their pro-
grams or positions disseminated to
the general student population. The
bottom line is, however, that the uni-
versity has failed to even marginally
improve the situation. Indeed, the
danger is now at its worst poi_nt ever.
The university has been embar-
rassed in its efforts to protect the
‘students by the many shrill oppo-
nents that have bluffed the univer-

sity out of even trying sweeping-

changes and by the polished, well-
organized committees that form
such a maze of red tape. Make no
mistakezvarious groups,from the
O.D.I. to the Bellefield Area Citi-
zens Association, groups that have
done muchgood work for Oakland
in the past, all for many various rea-
sons oppose any of the vital traffic
changes neccessary to change the
deadly situation on Fifth. The riot

  

act has "been read about how busi-
ness would suffer, about how pollu-
tion would increase if the cars were
slowed down, if Fifth were made
two-way again.Oakland has made

plenty of money from the students '

— the city knows Pitt is the single

largest employer, PAT knows that o

Oakland is the third largest ridership
in the state. With everyone making
money off of us, it is revolting to
imagine them all wholeheartedly
opposing the steps needed to protect
the innocent students and other
pedestrians because it would inter-
fere with their profits or it would
slow their ride from town. We‘vejust
let ourselves be fooled into believing
that they were right, that we couldn't

really touch the traffic problem. But ,

we are just as real and our problem
just as important as the annoyance
to city, PAT, merchants and citizen
groups. They all, by the way, think
that traffic in Oakland is sacrosanct,

that any change, especially the rem- ‘

oval of the buslane, would result in
disaster.‘

We must ask: who are these
experts? How did they decide that

disaster would occur when Oakland
got along fine when Fifth was two-

further, that based solely on their

intuition, the university may not act ‘

to protect its students? Who are they

to want to keep making proﬁts off of"

us and the university but not allow
us to do a thing to change an uncons-
cionable situation? What, is this insi-
dious network that even has people
close to the chancellor advising him
to hold back his demand that the
buslane be removed‘? How could this-
situation have gotten so perverted?!
The chancellor wants to act for Pitt,
and once he does, he will bring enor-
mous weight to bear, but the incredi-
ble complex set of self-interest

groups and committees has held '

back his hand until now. Now, for
the first time, we are in sight of a

breakthrough after all the years of.

frustration.

Religion

andpoliti

By Ilona Segedy
The Pitt News

Rev. Gail Buckwalter King and
Rev. Thelma Mitchell provided a
woman's perspective on theology in
American politics Wednesday after-
noon in Forbes Quadrangle. The
turnout for this lecture, the third in a
pre-election series, was small.

King, an ordained Presbyterian
minister of 18 years, and co-pastor
at University City Ministries, stated

that a basic issue today involves the

relationship between religion and
politics.

Today, the two are inseparable,
according to the two women
ministers.

cs inseparable say ministers

our culture where we can no longer
use the argument that we are being
neutral,” King said.
Such neutrality is impossible, she
-believes, because all public policy
has some kind of moral values.
According to King, the current
presidential election is marked by a
two-sidedness. “One side is focusing
on pragmatized issues like abortion
and school prayer and parochial
schools  what I call family issues or
personal tie issues,” stated King.
“The other side has a focus on reli-
gion in terms of what we’ve become
more accustomed to in terms of
charity and justice.” ~ -

A cause for concern, said King, is
that “we have before us various
groups entering the act on single
issue politics.”

(.\YI" '€'|..~I: "l“|’>l-F

She cited that the Catholic
Church of Pittsburgh is pushing pol-
itical candidates when claiming not
to, Boston archbishops are pushing
for single, issues and Evangelical
Christians are pushing personalized
issues such as war and peace.

Mitchell, an ordained Baptist
minister at the First Baptist Church
in Oakland, extended the topic of
discussion by admitting that she
“can never divorce" her womanhood
and blackness. ‘

“The way I respond to anything
comes through that filter,” she said.

Mitchell stated that the Black
church is an important part of the
American political system. As such,
“candidates go to the Black church
and court them,” she said. .

In her talk, Mitchell presented the

perspective of a black women‘s cau-
cus that met a month ago in Pitts-
burgh. The group, Black Women for
Political Justice, in its first meeting,
gathered to send representatives to a
national caucus.

Mitchell summarized the group’s
perspective. “For them, political

. activity had to transcend any kind of
partisan ideas or ideology and had
to be about one specific thing —
How to get enough food and how to
survive in America and how to do
that and make the political system
responsive to their needs.”

She expressed an amazement that
the bipartisan caucus began and
ended its meeting in prayer. “For
them, no political directive could be
appropriate or could be approp-
riately achieved without a spiritual
link.”

different than lifting a girl. The lifts
are timed to make it easier. Also, if
we were in the South, we could put a
lot more restrictions on the guys.
Here in the North, you can't be
picky." He was referring to the small
number of men who try out for
cheerleading at northern schools as
opposed to ‘those at southern
schools.

As far as the girls’ methods for
making .'the weight each week,
Nuzzo seems to feel that it is their
own fault. “The girls knew since
February that they were going to
have their weight watched. They had
seven monthes to diet properly. No
one forced them to try out; they

chose to do it. They wouldn’t have to '

worry about their weight now if they
had been doing their job,”-stated
Nuzzo.

According to Nuzzo, most girls do
not have a problem with their
weight. In fact, most weigh in at less
then’ their required weight. How-
ever, in the future, the trainers may
begin working with percentage of
body fat as a means of measuring
weight. ‘‘It hasn’t been a problem so
far,” concluded Nuzzo.

Despite the obvious sacriﬁces
involved, year after year, young

‘ women continue cheering, marching

and generally adding color to the

football games. Perhaps it is the
glamour of being on national televi-i
son and having all eyes upon them

that keeps them going. Maybe it is

the spirit these girls tend to generate.

Whatever the reasons, it is evident

that these weigh-ins will continue as

I long as there are girls willing to go
through the process. '

lnvolving Pitt students in the uni-

_ versity’s 200th birthday celebration

is essential, said Dr. Robert Hickey,
executive director of the bicenten-
nial commission.

The Student Affairs office will
work with the commission so that all
interested students can get involved,
according to Hickey. The Student
Affairs office can then form sub-
committees, and students can
choose the committee in which they

_ have the most interest.

Even though the celebration will
not begin until Sept. 1986, Dr.
Hickey warns that two years is not
so distant when planning an event
like the university’s 200th birthday.

“We [the commission] want to
reach out nationally, internation-

ally, to the city of Pittsburgh, and
the community of Oakland,“ said
Hickey. “Looking back and sharing
our 200th birthday with the world,
and also looking ahead to the uni-
versity‘s future is what a birthday
celebration is all about,” he said.

Some early plans for the bicenten-
nial include a convocation to honor
Pitt’s_ most distinguished people, to
which ‘representatives from other
colleges will be invited.

After the convocation will be a
two to three day exhibit. The exhibit
will focus on Pitt's 200-year history,
and different types of memorabilia
will be displayed.

Some other events include sympo-
siums, and Founder’s Week; when

» experts in their respective fields will

be honored. Also high on the list of
future events, Pitt plans a parade,
fireworks, light-up night, a special
commencement ceremony complete
with a formal ball, an expanded
Homecoming celebration, and a

birthday party on the Cathedral of
Learning’s lawn.

The bicentennial will be a year-
long celebration beginning in Sep-
tember l986 and running well into

A I987. With a year’s worth of events

and activities planned one has to ask
how the funds will be raised to pay
for them all?

“The university has a lot of
friends,” said Hickey. These friends
donate time and help raise money.
Some of the friends include Pitts-
burgh corporations who make

, financial donations. Taken together,

these gifts will cover the extra costs
of the bicentennial, according to
Hickey.

“The bicentennial celebration

should be looked at as an asset, not ——

as a burden, because it enriches us
all,” said" Hickey.
Hickey says the best way for inter-

M ested students to get involved in the,‘

celebration is through the Student
Affairs office.

Perplexing politics

by Jeffrey Sewald
London. A rehearsal stage. The

players are strategically poised for -

action. An actress, in her 30's, moves
slowly downstage and speaks her

lines with fervor.

"Charlie!" interrupts her disen-
chanted director. "Don't camp it up!
Keep it real."

"Real?" she questions with a trem-
bling voice. "I can't do it."

. Perhaps "keeping it real" was ulti-
m’ately impossible for Charlie, the
struggling actress turned terroristl

. double agent in the film adaptation of

John LeCarre’s explosive best—seller
The Little Drummer Girl, but for real-life
actress Diane Keaton, keeping things
real was a monstrous problem from
the start.

Expertly directed by George Roy
Hill, the film takes us on a dizzying
journey through the tense world of
political espionage with an exhilarat-
ing quality of international intrigue,
drawing heavily upon the talents of
actors representing a total of six
nations. From England and Germany
to Israel, and from Greece to
Lebanon, the logistics of the film are
well-handled; continuity is effec-
tively maintained. The major stum-
bling block is the unbelievably
complex storyline. .

Diane Keaton plays Charlie, a
working actress who finds herself en-
snarled in an actual political drama,
recruited by Israeli counterintelli—
gence forces in an effort to stop the
carnage of Khalil, a Palestinian mega-
terrorist. Problem: at the outset of
the film, we see Charlie as a Palesti-
nian sympathizer. Why would she
eventually end up working for the
Israelis? It isn't for money. Doing
exotic wine commercials will pay the
bills and then some. How about for
love?

Charlie is quickly captivated by a

passionate speaker for the Palestin-
ian cause who is lecturing in London
 incognito. This mysterious revolu-
tionary begins to appear more and
more frequently in Charlie's world,
portrayed admirably and, eventually
(sans hood), handsomely by Greek
actor Yorgo Voyagis. This enigmatic
character, who we come to know as
Joseph, is most difficult to grasp but,‘
at the same time, is the most
interesting.

Joseph is a soft-spoken man of few
words though almost hyperaware of
his environment. He studies people,
he listens, he weighs his actions and
responses carefully. His role in the

film is absolutely crucial. Joseph"

shoulders the burden of selling Char-
lie on the importance of his cause,
luring her by way of her love for him
and under the auspices of a chance to

finally act on what she believes in. But I

take a guess as to which cause Joseph
is in alliance with. Guess again. The
Israelis.

At this point, The Little Drummer Girl
crosses over from being complex to
being confusing. Somehow we would
like to believe that Joseph's love for
Charlie isn't just a ploy, but then a
basic question arises. Does Joseph
really have any idea who he is? He
appears to have spent a lot of time
impersonating other people and his
existence seems to be predicated by
lies and deception. Why is Charlie
attracted to Joseph so strongly that
she is willing to risk her life to be near
him? Is it love? Want for thrills? Pride
in her abilities? Guilt over political
reticence? _ .

It is possible that Charlie sees this
challenge as an opportunity to ele-
vate her sense of self-importance and
to be genuinely working toward an
end of some sort, but with the onset
of interrogation and a form of brain-
washing, the filmibeginslto test the

strength of its seams.

Enter Klaus Kinski, West Ger-
many's man of a thousand faces, as
Kurtz, the impassioned yet patiently
clever. head of Israeli counter-
intelligence who accepts the difficult
task of transforming a common
actress into a steely-eyed counter-
spy. Kinski’s performance is impres-
sive, utilizing his ability to
comfortably play within a wide emo-
tional range, from the bullying inter-
rogator to the soft—hearted family
man who takes time out of his busily
terroristic day to’phone home and
check out the action on the home
front. ‘

The most awe-inspiring element of_
the film is the use of exotic locale to
establish a sense of romance for the
would—be love story of Charlie and
Joseph. Most notable were the scenes
shot at the Acropolis, the first filming
allowed there since 1963. The mag-
nificence of the ancient ruin, filmed
at night with the aid of a massive
crew and a gigantic network of
intense lights, provides a feeling of
stability and permanence that effec-
tively contrasts the constant and rad-
ical changes that occur in the livesof

 

Klaus Kinski and Diane Keaton in The Little Drummer Girl.

the characters. A poetic device par
excellence.

Dealing with international politics
in filmlis always hazardous, and The
Little ‘Drummer Girl falls certain prey to
such dangers. The film tends to be
pro-Paflestine, The Palestinian char-
acters, including the elusive terrorist
Khalil (played by Sami Frey), come
across as a bit less cunning and cere-
bral (although they do possess com-
bat wiles) but a lot truer to the heart.
While trying to convey the idea that
there are no good guys or bad guys in the
Middle East conflict, that the label of
terrorist continually shuttles back
and forth from one side to'the other,
the Palestinian argument in this film
appeals more to the emotions than to
the intellect. A straight arrow to the
heart of the public en masse.

The psychological struggle that
takes place in this film is a powerful
one, but one with many open—ended
questions‘. The plot of espionage, in
all its complexity, is strenuous to fol-

*low, but the payoff is the tightness of

the ending. The haunting brilliance
of the final bedroom scene brings to
mind the chill of Sonny's murder in
The Godfather. I-went pale  again.

Settling the score

by Leslie Bennett

-You lust and do not have; so you
commit murder. And you are
envious and cannot obtain; so you
fight and quarrel. '

— James 4:2

As a boy in the early 18th century,

' Antonio ‘Salieri prayed "the proudest

prayer a boy could think of." He made
a I-‘austian pact with God, vowing to
excel in his musical career, and live
his life full of virtue if only God
would grant him fame. Just when his
prayers seem to be heard, the voice of
God becomes "the voice of an obscene
child” —-— a child named Wolfgang

. Amadeus Mozart.

Regarded by many as the greatest

‘musical genius of all times, Mozart

couldn't even afford a casket to be
buried in when he died in 1791 at the
ageof 35. It's a disturbing conclusion
to Amadeus, Peter Shaffer's film adap-
tation of his Tony Award-winning
play.

An equally shocking scene starts
the film with the less prolific com-
poser Salieri slitting his own throat.

torical characters and,’ above all,
Mozart's passionate music.

Salieri, as ajdesperate and dying old
man-, narrates the story of the last 10
years of Mozart's life — a period 32
years prior — during which the two

compete for the Viennese emperor's .

favor. As the offical court composer,
Salieri maintains the greater respect
and reputation, though.he admits the
emperor "had no ear at all" for music.
But to Salieri, Mozart's astounding
talents are all too obvious. This is a
man who can memorize entire pieces

' after only one listening, who can play

them upside-down and improve them
in an instant. He began composing at
the age of four and was able to com-
pose complete symphonies from
beginning to end just as they
appeared in his head. This "creature"
possessed something divine, and
Salieri’s tragedy as the "patron of
mediocrity" is that he alone realizes
it.

What makes Salieri’s defeat even
more bitter is that Mozart is such an

minded, wears flamboyant wigs and

yet while Salieri promises chastity to
God, Mozart is chasing women under
tables. Salieri, obsessed with the joke

I he sees God playing on him, becomes

consumed with envy and sets out to
destroy his rival.

This sort of confrontation between
mediocrity and genius may be some-
thing of an obsession for the British
au_thor, whose earlier dramas, The
Royal’Hunt of the Sun (1964)and‘ Equus

   
          

juxtaposed under the eyes of God and
unfolds a contemporary, nihilistic

_ view of the world.

Amadeus, directed by Milos For-
man, succeeds in showing us a Salieri
whose notions about creativity,
music, and religion are shattered by a

Jdisrespectful, libertine Mozart. We

see_Salieri"in the balcony shadows
secretly cursing and praising his
rival's performances; we see him
overwhelmed at Mozart's dictation of
musical scores; and, finally, we see

him throw aicrucifix in the fire in

confusion _and desperation.
The'performance of F. Murray
Abra_-ham shows the young Salieri,
who is striving toward providential
glory, become a half-crazed has-been
looking forward only to death.
Tom. Hulce shines as Mozart. He

. captures the savant's madness with

rare clarity, especially in the climactic

scene. before Mozart's death, where "
. he recites his Requiem to Salieri.‘

With precise placement of musical
scores and film sequences, this pro-
duction brilliantly captures the
insides of these characters both visu-
ally and aurally, Salieri’s flashback
narration is never intrusive and
makes for a colorful script. But
beyond the script, the music itself,
conducted and supervised by Neville
Marriner, triumphs in’ ' tell-ing
Mozart's story. :The result is as enter-

Drunk and orderly

by Michael Selz

Under the Volcano has resisted 100
attempts at screenplays. Director
John Huston has wanted to make the
film for thirty years and read twenty
screenplay attempts himself. It
doesn't fall readily into normal film
categories either. Although its pro-
tagonist-is drunk for the duration, it's
not even about .alcoholism. It's not
catchy or slick and doesn't have a hot
soundtrack album. It's about the de-
struction of a man's spirit.

Albert Finney portrays /éx-British
consul Geoffey Firmin. His wife
Yvonne (Jacqueline Bisset) has left
and divorced him a year before after
having an affair VV_itl'l his half-

brother, Hugh (Anthony Andrews). .

On the morning of this holiday, she
returns to her husband in Cuernava—
ca with lots of hope and without
warning to begin fresh.
Complicating matters, Hugh, a
dashing man—of-action/journalist,
has returned from his own exile cov-
ering the Spanish Revolution and
now does double duty investigating
Nazi-backed Mexicans as well as dot-
ing on the consul, prescribing a
strychnine cure for his alcoholism. At
Yvonne's return, the gallant Hugh
offers to leave. But the consul insists
that Hugh remain, quashing the
"decent" fellow's protests that his
presence might hamper the healing

of their marriage.

Both ex-wife and half—brother
seem to tap into the vigor and the
ebullience of‘ the consul, clothing
their guilt in the notion that the silly-
old—bear-of-an-alcoholic needs them.

Finney staggers through the entire
movie magnificently. He wanders
amidst a carnival scene at the -film's
beginning, reeling in his tuxedo with-
out socks, befriending a stray dog,
giving an impromptu speech against
fascism at the festival dance. But his
exuberance is delicate, as he reminds
his wife the next morning: "Surely
you appreciate the fine balance I
strike between the shakes of too little
and the abyss of too much."

He has lost his values and his will to
live. Presumably, this was precipi-
tated by his wife's betrayal. But her
return does nothing to reverse it. The
childlike joy he finds in drink is more
dependable than people. He is not
morose or suicidal. He just prefers
the constancy of alcohol. His wife's
return is sweet to him, but pointless.
He observes her tea service nostalgi-
cally: "You've always cradled your
lemon wedges so  meticulous,” and
seized with affection, he straddles
her, tries to conjure up some passion
but can't, apologizes and runs to nap
face—down in the street.

He doesn't look ahead to a new
start except once or twice when he
indulges Yvonne's desperate fanta-

Albert Finney stars in Under the Volcano.

sies. At one point, he pulls himself
from one of her reveries, bitterly
asserting, "Hell is my natural habitat.
It's not possible  not enough. Not in
this world."

Though Finney is at the center of
the film, Jacqueline Bisset and
Anthony Andrews give performan-
ces that are both eloquent and subtle.
Jacqueline Bisset exudes a mature,
quiet beauty and complexity that the
likes of Catherine Deneuve can only
attempt to approximate. She is
wracked with pain as she realizes her
inability to do anything for her hus-
band but doesn't fill the screen with
agonized expressions and knuckle-
biting. Her anguish is internalized
and all the more palpable for it.

The film was shot entirely in Mex-
ico in the village of Yautepec near the
city of Cuernevaca and Popocapetyl,

the volcano of the title. John Huston,
as his reputation (and his obsession
with this project) would dictate, made
a searingly beautiful film.

The film is elegaic. Nearly from its
start, the fate of the consul is inevita-
ble. His death has seemingly already
occurred. The film celebrates his
indomitable spirit — what makes him
drink. So if it is about despair, it's not
wholly depressing. ,

At the film's beginning, the propri-
etor of a barlmovie house is explain-
ing the plot of The Hands of Orloc, in
which a pianist who loses his hands is
given the hands of a murderer. The
proprietor says that the pianist is
very sorry for that. The consul offers
brusquely, "There are some things
you can't apologize for." When
you've destroyed someone, an apol-
ogy won't suffice.

Joan Jett’s harshest critics are
those who don't understand.
where she's coming from.
Granted, she doesn't have Pat
Benatar’s voice, _
-have Cyndi Lauper’s efferves-

Nobody jams like JoanJett; she's
the girl who truly does love rock
’n’ roll. .

. Glorious Results Of A Misspent
V Youth is her fourth solo album,

 her third with her back-up

band, the Blackhearts. It's a set-
em-up and knock-em-down_col-
‘lection of songs dealing with the

‘ unwanted tribulations of teen-
 age love and worry.

Curiously, the four most

ambitious cuts from the"album‘

don't f.ollow the lively rock ’n’

Showcase, Friday, October 19,. 1984 if

By Darren Hvizdash

Gracing the scenes of the heavy
construction on South Craig Street is
the Pittsburgh Plan for Art, the alter-
native space of Oakland. The Plan,
formerly called the PPA Gallery, is
featuring the second show of its new
season with an exhibition of four
artists: Anne Varick, Dan R_ice, Sister
Adele and Walter Groer. This eclectic

extravaganza is a wild variety of

assorted media. .
Eclectic, indeed, is the art of Anne
Varick. Her exhibition, alone repre-
sents a wide array of mixed media.
She has a long series of fantasy
forms. These are pencil on paper

drawings of unidentifiable forms. _j

Each drawing contains just one single
dominant form. The forms are solid

objects; many seem‘ to be three—_

dimensional. What is amazing about
these forms is that they look familiar

‘but can't be identified. They have

shape, but they are shapeless.
Creating objects that are _familiar
but yet unidentifiable is a favorite
theme in Anne Varick's work. Often,
she will take one of these forms and
create a series of works in which each
successive segment of the series. is
altered slightly from the last. I-Ier
exhibition also contains bronze

 

reliefs of streamlined, geometrically
perfect humanoid figures that at the
least have a decorative aesthetic

value. She even has a number of coni- '

cal bronze sculptures. All of these go
together to make a visually exciting

. exhibit.

Visually exciting is an understate-
ment for the large, single piece by
Dan Rice “called Self-Portrait: Fooler
Brushman. This is a shaped canvas in
the form of a large paint brush with
the bristles of the brush made into
the profile of the artist's face. Stand-
ing on the nose of the profile is the

artist with a paint brush and paint.
bucket in hand. Across the face pro- ‘

file are scenes of people and city life.

What is really happening is not dis-
cernable, but the work seems both
comical and nightmarish. First, there
is ad pun on Fooler Brushman; an

artist is a brushman and the brush is E

the artist's face. The artist with the
scenes of people and city life‘ may be
trying to show the artist's relation to
life. The two faces of the artist
reflecting each other may be showing
art's reflection of life. '

fied wood or water. These fields give

of melancholy. Wood._is one of the

work seems to be deliberate. The--

mentlwere all carefully arranged and
planned with order. Also, the colors

are dulled and subtle rather than,

work a balanced sense of order for

BLACK FLAG AND SACCHARINE

Electric Banana

October 15, 1984

 _ by Angie Hirsch

Setting gel, styling mousse and
studded leather outfitted the placid,
young Electric Banana patrons Mon-
day night as they waited patiently for
the 5:30 show to begin. At 6:30, the
doors opened and Saccharine Trust
began to play. Although their first
number, ”Testing, One, Two,
Three,” lasted about thirty ‘minutes
longer than necessary, it was the only
flaw in their performance.

The crowd's initial reaction was a
half-hearted slam dance, but they
slowly sweetened up to the'band’s
vocalist as he twisted, jumped and
intrigued them with his animated
gestures and facial expressions. His
voice meshed perfectly with the gui-
tar, bass and syncopated drum beats
behind him.

‘ The music was metal and powerful,
but not overpowering. Saccharine

material, and closed with the Black
Flag standard, ”Six Pack," to ”save
[the audience] the trouble of request-
ing it later,” as they put it. This band
is ready to.solo.

Saccharine Trust probably would
have been better received if they had
gone solo. Black Flag was difficult to
overshadow.

They opened Monday's concert
with ”Obliteration," an instrumental,
which allowed lead vocalist Henry
Rollins to make a dramatic entrance.
His tatooed body writhed with emo-
tion as he sang, and he seemed to
have an endless supply of energy.

Rollins evoked the crowd's strong-
est emotions with songs like ’’Rise

, Above,” screaming, ”We are tired of

your abuse! Try to stop us, but it's no
use!” Rise above, rise above, rise
above, we're gonna rise above!" Dur-
ing this song, one mohawked fan
placed a bar stool in the middle of the
floor and literally rose above the

crowd, which was slam dancing in full
force by this time. Fans gathered
around Rollins and shouted lyrics

Big East weekend in x-co

Vasvary  
leads  
runners

By Rich McKenzie
The Pitt News

This weekend, the University of
Pittsburgh cross country team trav-
els to Franklin Park in Boston,
Mass., for the Big East Conference
Championships. The Big East annu-
ally turns out some of the best cross
country teams in the nation. Year in
and year out, at least one or two of
the teams from the conference are
among the top 20 teams in the
nation.

This will be a true test for this
young and relatively inexperienced
Panther squad who currently sport a
4-1 record in meet competition. Last
season, the Panthers finished eighth
out of nine teams. This season,
Coach Vasvary said he “hopes to
improve over last year, as I feel that
our squad is much improved over
the one that ran last season. With a

‘good crop of incoming freshmen,
coupled with the fact that ,our
sophomores have their feet wet, so
to speak, I am‘optimistic of our
chances for improving‘ our posi-
tion.” He would not elaborate as to
what position he predicted the team
would finish,- saying only, “I don’t
like to speculate on those types ‘of
things, but I do hope that we can
improve our position over last year
and continue to improve as a team
this season as we [already] have in
our first five meets. We are looking

' for Bob [Wiener] to run strong and
some of our gother runners to
improve.” ’

When Vasvary “was asked who he
thought were the pre-race favorites
he said, “You would have to go
along with the teams that have been
.at the top the previous few years.
These are Georgetown, who I feel
will finish first, followed by Provi-
dence, and Boston College could slip
past Villanova,” thus unseating the

Wildcats as one ofthe perennial top

three teams of the division.

Jack McDonald, who is the chair-.
man of Big East cross country and
also the coach of the Boston College
Eagles,‘ admitted he was a little
biased when he said, “I am optimis-
tic of our chances this ‘season but

jyou, have to look at Villanova,

Georgetown and Providence also.
Throw all four of those into a hat
this -Saturday and anyone of them
could walk away with the team
championship." When asked who he
considered to be the favorites in the
individual competition, he said that
it could be any one of eight runners.
The people that he’ included were
Richard O’Flynn andRich Mulligan
of Providence’s predominantly Irish

team, Anthony O’Reilly of Villan-r
ova, Kevin King and Frank McCon-.

The Pitt News ~ -

A morbid hush swamped

promises and commitments fall

Schnellenberger, formerly the
University of Miami’s equivalent
to the Vatican's Pope,
announced on May 25 intentions
to jump ship to a proposed
USFL team. His_sense_of timing
caused as much a stir as his aban-
doning of earlier‘ spoken pledges
to faithfully stand by a football
program he assured could only
go up. '

Eleven days later that program
had a new head coach. A flurry
of moving andshaking by UM
during the previous 24 hours
produced Jimmy Johnson.

It was all too quick for anyone
following, or associated with,
last year’s national champions to
comprehend. Questions of conti-

st_aff relationships’ and sub-.500
performances received a lot of
play. “At first I didn’t know what
to think,” said Andy Baratta, a
Miami grad assistant. “I didn’t
know much about the guy [John-
son]. Nobody did. He's‘ come in
and done a great job." ' A A
He probably pleaded with
’ everyone, asking them to have
patience, to wait until the season
started to prove he could pro-
duce a winner. GuildingtheHUr-
. ricanes into tomorrow’s match-
up with the Panthers (12:20 p.m.
kickoff), he has-so far lived up to
all expectations accorded his
predecessor, apgrandfatherly fig-

ure at that.  ' '

Johnson guiding (_l.M. well

‘having the benefit of spring prac-

tice made for a trying time."
Johnson, a Pitt defensive coordi-
nator in 1977-78, admitted. “It’s
hard to cram a lot ofthings into a
short time. Never having met the
players after they reported in
August is not the easiest thing to
do.” b

He , tread even deeper water
before, by allaying the alumni’s
shortness of breath. “I tried to be
as active as“ possible with -the
boosters and alumni, doing most
of that before the season. I made
[it] known that after the season
it’s 100 percent football. I tried to
explain there was going to be no
speaking engagements, that I
need to spend time with the
team.“ ’ a

He had to. Miami's first four
games (road trips) encompassed
19 days. As the schedule’s dates
neared, premortems . entailed
U'M’s demise, what with contests
against Auburn, Florida, Michi-
gan, Florida State, Notre Dame
and Boston College, among
others.

Since then, the pity has turned
into incredulity. Since visitors to
Ann Arbor win, oh, once every
decade and UM tired against
FSU a month ago (38-3), John-

‘son is, 60 minutes away from

being 7-2. .

“I don’t think there's any ques- I

tion, every coach I've talked to,

, ..they all said this is the toughest

schedule they‘ve ever seen,"
Johnson'said. “But it’s not over
yet. At least three of the last four
games are at home and of the
seven road games, five are highly
touted football teams."

What Johnson" directs toward

his opponents has been equally‘ V

shed on UM. Despite a rash of
key injuries the last several

Kosar. He‘s having another
superlative year, passing for
2,151 yards and 15 touchdowns.
Of his 11 interceptions, six came
against Michigan in a 22-14 loss.
“Everything is said and written
about him that there can be,"
Johnson intoned. “When he
takes the field you get the feeling
he’s in complete control. He’s a
pleasure to "work with.” ‘ »
So is Kosar's "supporting cast.

wideouts, Stanley\ Shakespeare
and Eddie Brown, are having
another lucrative year. Twenty-
nine catches later, Shakespeare
picks up an average of 15 yards

back to guard against Kosar’s
exploits, Miami has found equal
success with its ground game.
I-Ialfback ‘Alonzo Highsmith

Though throwing no excuses

The Pitt News

New York. The city. “so nice they

named it twice.” It has overeight--

million people, it has the Statue of
Liberty, it even has the Bronx, and
this weekend, it has the l984"Bi2
East Women’s Tennis
pionship.

Among the 54 players from the _,

nine colleges and universities that

make up Big East, six of those play-  ‘
ers‘ will be from the University of —

Pittsburgh. Pitt will be led by No. 1

player Jodi Levine and No. 2 player i ’
Rhonda Gibbs, who is the only Pitt .

player ever with a Big East win. ‘
Pitt finished dead last in the 1983
tournament, but this year head
coach George Dieffenbach is" look-
ing to take a sweeter bite of the Big
Apple. “At the tournament this year,
we want to win more matches than
we did last year, and we wantfto

finish eighth or higher,”' said the‘

coach. 2
_A large part of a team's success or

failure at the Big East depends on

the first day of competition. It is

then that a team plays its way either I1’

into the championship bracket‘ or

the consolation bracket. “That -first V

day is the key for us. We need to
have a lot of wins there, get ourselves

off to a good start, then get into the V7 I

championship (bracket, where we
can get a lot more points." In the
consolation bracket, only half as

many points are awarded to the .5 ‘

winner. -

The Panthers‘ Big East lineup will .

include the team’s top six per-
formers from the just-completed
regular season, and Dieffenbach
says anyone of the players he takes
is capable of a win. “I think we will
be able to win at any position; it
depends on the competition." .
Here is a quick rundown of the

team that will be traveling to New . I

York: .

Jodi Levine‘— the team's most ,

consistent player, who only had two
losses all year. She is one ofthe three
Lady Panthers with Big East expe-
rience. The Big East will be a good
test for her against some of the top
collegiate talent in the East.
Rhonda Gibbs — the Big East
winner last year at the No. 5 posi-
tioi_i,_she will face much stiffer com-

Gridiron Gurus took a sabbatical of

the college football season and, well,
time for a break. Secondly, things
weren’t going so well record-wise, so
the one week layoff might be put to
good use now. Who knows?

One thing is for sure. This week's

Booters win on ‘gimme’

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News

The soccer team has been
faced with scoring difficulties all
season, and has been searching
for a means to surmount this ‘pre-
dicament. Last night unfolded a
clear solution: If you can’t score
the goal, have your opponent do

it for you. Robert Morris didjust.

that, giving Pitt the 2-1 win.
It was in the second half, with

“the forward line played well,

despite the conditions.” Pitt’s
first goal, for which they can take
full credit, was scored off a free
kick by midfielder Victor Hugo,
a junior from Arlington, Va.
“The assist, which came from
Scott Reimer, was perfect,”

recalls Hugo. “The goal came
, from an indirect kick from about

10 [Robert Morris] yards, which
I was ableito slip past a wall of
about five R.M. defenders.”
The dreary weather proved to
be a hindrance for the defense as

head coach, and we really
wanted to prove to him that we
were the better team,” continued
Katzin, “but the weather hin-
dered us from playingjour best."
The victory over Robert Mor-
ris brings the Panthers closer to
their goal of reaching the Big
East Championships. Yet the
road ahead isn‘t going to be easy,
starting with Saturday's match
against Edinboro. “They’re
always a tough competitor,” said
Luxbacher, “especially when
they’re playing at home.”

the score tied at 1-1, when a

played a major factor in our de-
fensive game, but it was a disad-
vantage for both teams,” said
senior Jamie Katzin, who
replaced injured Brian Casey as _

added incentive came from the
fact that me and a few other play-
ers had been coached by Coach

to finish as high as fifth. With the -
amount of talent present on the top
four teams, coupled with the youth
and inexperience of the Panther
squad, for the Panthers to break the
top four would be almost a miracle.

Spikers eagerly await revenge, slam-dunk

By Laurie Kubll
The Pitt News

It stung. lt stung so deeply, in fact,
that the Pitt women’s volleyball

P, team (I7-4) has little difficulty in

wanting — no, demanding to defeat
Providence (24-3) again
weekend's Pitt Invitational at Fitz-

starts at 8 p.m. Saturday, following

A ’a slam dunk contest between

members of the men's basketball
team.

“Every single time we play [Provi-
dence] we look forward to beating
them," said senior Ulana Kohutiak.
Kohutiak, who has a shot at attain-
ing All-America status this season,
may not be able to compete in what

_ promises to be an exciting but gruel-

ing weekend. The middle blocker
injured her back in last weekend's
successful southern journey and is
unsure of her playing status for
tonight's 7 p.m. match against York.

tion and the new freshman players
for the first time; many are coming
up to see both. In addition, we have
developed a large, knowledgable
volleyball following that should turn
out in full force.”

The Providence match holds spe-
cial significance in addition to the
promotional event. Pitt defeated the

. Lady Friars earlier this season, but

sometimes once is not enough. Prov-
idence put a sudden-death ending to
Pitt’s season last November when it
defeated the spikers in the cham-
pionship match of the Big East Con-
ference finals, thus killing
season-long hopes of playing in the
NCAA national tournament.

“As long as our players remember
the sting of that defeat, we will con-

tinue to really improve and prepare .

for this 'year’s championships,” said
Collier. “If they get overconfident
and forget the sting of that defeat,
we are in trouble. I know my players,
and they will be ready to play tomor-

row night and at the championships e

in November.”

Their first opponent is York, from
Ontario, Canada, and Collier says it
is “probably one ofthe best teams we
will play all season. They have sev-
eral Canadian Junior National
Team members. They could be con-
sidered the tournament favorites."
He said that the match is signiﬁcant
for the two Canadians on his team,
Kohutiak and freshman Louise
O’Shaughnessy.

Kohutiak confirmed this signifi-
cance. “They’re a good team, and I
want to play them so bad.” She said
that Cleveland State, the team least
likely to win, cannot be overlooked.
“You have to treat every team with

importance. We learned that from ,

last year, when we lost to some
teams -we shouldn’t have."

“Cleveland State always gives Pitt
problems,” Collier remarked. “They
always ‘play a strong match against
Pitt and this weekend will be no dif-
ferent. They recently returned from
a California tour where they played
UCLA, USC and others and should

be much improved as a result of the
trip."

The spikers will take a cross-state
trip of their own when they travel to
Penn State (15-2), with whom they
have an intense rivalry. The stakes
are a little higher this time, however.
The Lady Lions earned a No. 7
national ranking by defeating sev-
eral top teams, including the former

No. I team, the University of the

Pacific.

“To us, it's just another Penn
State match," Collier asserted. Just
another Penn State match? “We’ll
get fired up and the match should be

up for grabs. Once we start the V

match, the ranking is insignificant.
If we start playing well, it’s_not as if
they can stop the match and say,
‘Wait a minute, we‘re nationally
ranked so we’ll‘add 10 points to our
score.’ The pressure’s on them, and
we can go in with a nothing-to-lose,
_knock-them-off attitude. Tradition-

ally, we've played well under those '

circumstances.”

Kohutiak said she is primarily
concerned with the matches tonight
and tomorrow, which is safer. “Last
season welooked too far ahead. We
were wishy-washy, looking ahead
too much.” She said that the team
always gets up for PSU, but it will

not be easy; the middle bIocker—

noted the presence of the other top
spiker in the East, Lori Barbarich.
