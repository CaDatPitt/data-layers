~ Thirty years ago,_then-Penn-
sylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh
received word during a morning
budget meeting that an incident at
the nuclear facility near Middletown,
in central Pennsylvania, demanded
his attention.

He learned that since 4 a.m.,
operators and engineers had been
frantically trying to interpret the
screaming instrumentation, a bright
cacophony of lights and alarms tell-
ing them something was terribly
wrong.

Fuel was damaged, causing part
of the reactor core to melt Though
the event ultimately presented no
physical danger to the public, the

Thomburgh was at the helm. _

“We were dealing with some—
thing that had never happened on
the face of the earth before,” said
Thornburgh, “and I was no expert.
I had only been in office for 72 days
as governor.” '

Two weekends ago marked the
30th anniversary of the incident.
Thornburgh’s collection of materi-
als concerning the Three Mile Island
incident is currently on display in the
Thornburgh Room of the Hillman
library The array of Associated

Press news bulletins, .memos, re-

ports and news clippings — often
annotated by Thornburgh in red pen
—— reveals the governor’s effort to
ensure the accuracy of the investiga-
tion into the incident and to assure a

panicked public of its safety.
Nancy Watson, a longtime friend
of Thornburgh’s and curator of

the collection, called Thornburgh ,

Thornburgh faced what he called
“a lot of self—appointed experts,”
giving conﬂicting reports about the
safety or danger of the situation “to

“People were, interested in tell-

than they knew,”, he said. “There
were zealots on both sides of the

the Union Assembly Room last night.

by Caitlyn Christensen

Peeing was a form of protest for one
woman.
- Her wheelchair was too large to ﬁt through
the bathroom stalls on her college campus. So,
she peed in the garden instead.

Her story was just one of many recounted

the fact that she was embarrassed because she
wasn’t wearing underwear at the time. Cecilia
Wambach, a visiting member from “That Takes
Ovanesl,” led the storytelling and discussion
that occurred during the event.

“I’m here to encourage you to go down the
road of boldness,” she said. V

“We can’t approveeverything,” he

The discussion heated up when

“Everything comes down to mon-

Aaron Arnold, the former president

“It was fortunate because he had
that sort of mind,” she‘ said. “He
didn’t just listen to the person who
spoke the loudest  but dealt strictly
with the facts of the matter.”

One of the most vexing prob-

lems was whether to evacuate the

surrounding population. Thorn-
burgh said that he was not going

to evacuate 250,000 people unless _
he was “absolutely certain” that it A

was necessary.
The costs of evacuation — hos-

pitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.

—— would be enormous. More fright-
ening still was the prospect of real
danger if they didn’t evacuate.
Which is why, for Thornburgh,

hero of the incident.” Thornburgh
remembers him as very plainspoken,

‘walking the site was calming, and

soon most were sure thatno physical
danger manifested. But one of the
10 lessons learned from Three Mile

over.” _

The accident at Three Mile Is-

13 years to clean up. Thornburgh
worked with local, state—wide and
national officials to oversee the
clean—up, everyone from environ-

 Same-sex marriage laws 

 promote equality, 

Progress is sometimes slow and .

arduous, especially when dealing with
people’s deepset beliefs and convic-
tions. So it is more than a little surpris-
ing that some.of the most substantial
progress toward civil rights for same-
sex couples should come about in a
period of less than a week.

Last Friday, the Iowa Supreme
Court rejected as unconstitutional
a state law restncting marriage to a
union between a man and a woman

if by upholding a lower court’s  on

I the law And on Tuesday, the Vermont

legislature voted to override Gov.
Douglas’ veto of a bill that would per-
rnit gay marriages in the state, 
the bill a law

If there’s anything to be said here,

 it’s congratulations to these two states
3 These moves could well mark a turn-

ing point in the general sentiment to-

 ward gay marriage in this country.

Vermont was also the first state to
allow civil unions between same—sex

 couples, which started in 2000, while
 Iowa was among the first states to
2 allow interracial maniage and admit

 women into the state bar to practice

~law

It’s difficult to imagine that there

 were once laws prohibiting these ac-

 tions. But gay rights are a civil rights I

 argue that the laws against same-sex 4,

issue, and it’s almost impossible to

marriage are anything other than dis-
criminatory.

But not only are these decisions
a step forward for equality and civil
rights in the United States, they’re
also a refreshing reminder that there

2 is still some measure of decency and

common sense present in the legal

3 system.

But there is still so much progress

 left to ‘be made Sure, the Iowa and

 Vermont decisions are huge steps in

  

‘H

laeatsaaaayasla

the direction of civil rights and equal 
justice, but there are still a vast number 
of hurdles to clear before same—sex 

marriages and civil unions are legal 

and recognized across the country 1
For instance, the federal Defense 

of Marriage Act allows any state to  '
ignoreasame-sexmarriageperformed 3 '

in another state It also prohibits the 
federal government from. treating any 
same-sex relationship as a marriage, 
even if it was legally performed and 
recognized within that state

President Barack Obama’s admin— 
istration has already pledged to repeal 
the law, but whether this attempt will 
be successful orwill ever materialize is 
still unclear. The US. Supreme Court 
has declined to review any cases chal- A

the law in the air for now

Individual state laws and con— E
stitutional amendments prohibiting 
gay marriage will have to come down 5

1mgingD0MAJmgd°eﬁMe0f§ Obama too quick to e

one by one for the movement to  5
ground — something that will likely 

happen with time, though how long 

it will take is impossible to say. ‘
One  is sure: If our society 
is going to place value on equality 

- and fairness under law, then we really 

have no choice but to make same-sex 
marriages legal Sexual orientation is 
already aprotected classiﬁcation under 
federal and most state laws, and dis-
crimination against gays and lesbians 
is becoming increasingly difficult to 
justify fromalegal standpoint f

We have no doubt that at some 
poi_ntin the future, same—sex marriages
will be legal across the country, in no ;
small part because of the effortsin 
Vermont,.Iowa and other states The 
only  left to do is to keep this 
progress moving toward the ultimate 
goal of equality and fairness forallU.S. 
citizens in all aspects of their lives. /

I on the recent congressional visit as

a propaganda coup, with Fidel Cas-
tro writing, “They are witnesses to

_ the respect with which Americans

who visit our homeland are always
received.”
But what Obama and the Con-

- gressional Black Caucus don’t under-

stand is that respect is a totally foreign
concept to the Cuban dictatorship.
How can a government conﬁs-
cate the property of both Cuban and
American citizens and still  to
respect people? How can a govern-
ment intern homosexuals and politi-
cal dissidents in concentration camps
and still claim to respect people?

And more importantly, how can i"

the Obama administration expect
such a government to respect treaties,
Americans or basic human rights?

nergy drinks inferior to natural sleep

 

by Keith Gillogly
Adar. Opiniotw Editor

The prospect of staying up all
night laboring over a stubborn paper
or studying ourselves into a stupor
is an all—too-common college experi-
ence. W/hen we face these daunting
all—nighters, most of us want a little
help staying sharp. While some might
head for Starbucks, others reach for
thoseglitzy, skinny bullet-shaped
cans: energy drinks.

All energy drink brands seem to
have two common qualities: appeal-
ing, ﬂashy designs and logos and glib
promises of getting you, well, ener-
gized. -

Red Bull — probably the most
ubiquitous energy elixir on the mar-
ket — advertises that its drinkers will
sproutwings upon consumption. But
I’ve seen plenty of - people popping
cans of Red Bull at all hours, and I
have yet to see anyone grow 
Either way, people are  it
right up. i

I was quite curious as to the abili-
ties of energy drinks when the bev-
erage buzz began several years ago,

so I sampled a few of the big—name
brands. To my disappointment, I
found they all taste like battery acid,
and I’d probably only drink one, were
I about to compete in a triathlon.

Really, you can hardly blame me
for expecting a lo't'out‘of this juice.
Monster provides a “wicked mega
hit” of energy, at least according to
the description on the can. Judging
by that gnarly description, a single. sip
should have me about ready to scale
the Cathedral.

And maybe it would. These drinks

° contain a superior chemical concoc-

tion of energizers like taurine, ginseng
and, of course, copious amounts of
caffeine. But the health maladies as-
sociated with high caffeine intake
range from restlessness to nausea,
tremors and rapid heart rate. '

Now, I suppose these risks might
be worth it to someone who has to
endure the occasional all—nighter, but
when today’s energy addicts need a

17 oz. Red  just to get out of bed, '

I think there’s something wrong

I just can’t think of a reason to
have to down energy drinks just to
get through the day with your eyes

open. Unless they’re used marginally» I

and at appropriate times —— namely
when the body is under acute physical

or mental strain —— consumption of
these beverages only cheats the body

of nature’s natural energizer. And no, '

I don’t mean coffee. I mean sleep.

The energy drink craze tells us ‘

more than anything else that sleep
is becoming a luxury that the vast
majority of people can’t afford

any more. We’re simply not getting ‘

§€ I
_, VVhen today’s energy

addicts need a 17 oz.
Red Bull just to get out

E?"

enough — but everyone knows that
already. I P

Whafs truly interesting is that the
craze highlights our inclination to

‘take the easy way out. Even the most

s -out energy addict realizes that
downing one of those little ﬁve-hour
energy shots and chasing it with a
Monster doesn’t equate to a good
night’s rest. But hey, a good night’s

rest takes eight hours. Shotgunning.

a Cocaine — actually a reallenergy
drink —— takes eight seconds.

It’s not the beverages themselves
that are the real problem. It’s our
misuse of them. I’ve heard some
energy addicts say they started out
with one drink just to make it through
that lunch hour lull and are now con-
suming upward of two or three cans
over the course of the day.

And an energy addict must con-
sume more and more of his drug
to maintain that perpetual chemical
high. The conniving manufacturers
behind these beverages know our
habits all too well. The users get ad-
dicted to where they’ll easily pay the
inﬂated $2 to $3 for a single hit. The
U.S. market for energy drinks was
estimated at $5.4-billion in 2006,. ac-

‘ cording to an article in USA Today,

and grows atian annual rate of 55
percent per year.

The only way to negotiate the
unavoidable energy crash is to go to
sleep — clearly not an option — or
crack another can. I

And if you go to sleep, you know
the only way you’ll ﬁnish that 10-
pageipaper is in your dreams. So go

‘ ahead, pop open the can.v‘You’ll be

feeling good in a moment, revved as
a chainsaw by the time you ﬁnish it.

But we shouldn’t be surprised how
successful energy beverages are. The

rage reﬂects a long—standing mental-
ity: If something’s not right with our
bodies, there’s always an ingestible
product to quell our discomforts.

Why should you have to deal with

a headache? Quick, pop an Advil.
{Did that Market Central macaroni
giveiyou an upset stomach? Yay,

Pepto Bismol! Too tired to make

of 7—Eleven and take your pick of
pick—me—ups. Or maybe you’Ve had
one too manyi'Red Bulls and now

you can’t get to sleep. Don’t worry.-

Sleeping pills are available over the
counter.

The point I’m trying to make
can, be found in perhaps the most
ironic place: right on the can. Below
that long list of unpronounceable
ingredients, there’s a warning on
Monster cans that reads: “Consume
responsibly ——  three cans per
day. Not recommended for children,
pregnant women or people sensitive
to caffeine".-”

Thanks for the warning, Monster,
but I think I’ll leave the  the
can and get some sleep instead.

Cuban dictatorship does not deserve U.S. support

Howard, page 7

While I do not support the exist-
ing travel ban and do not believe that

the US. government has the constitu- ,

tional right to restrict the movement
of its citizens, I am concerned that
Obama’s move to ease the travel ban
is a pretense to rapprochement with
the Cuban dictatorship.

The U.S. government should be

working toward a free Cuba, rather
than a Cuba that Americans are free
to visit at will.

And although the embargo has
not been successful in toppling Cuban
despotism, it has served as a message
to the world that the United States
strongly condemns the actions and
existence of the Castro government

Abandoning the embargo would
send the wrong signalto Cuba and
the wrong  to Cuban exiles who
have pinned their hopes on this nation
and its commitment to liberty.

Regrettably, the president that
many of us voted for because we per-
ceived him as an idealist committed
to liberty both abroad and at home

has proven to be a man committed to,

neither. The principled foreign policy

he promised to enact has failed to

materialize. I
The easy way in which he and his

' congressional allies approach opening

relations with a dictator is disgusting.
It constitutes a transgression against
the values that our republic is founded

on and functions as a clear message
to thugs and despots the world over:
Oppress your people, conﬁscate pri-
vate property and ally yourself with
our enemies. If you wait 50 years,
maybe we’ll forgive you.

‘Yerma' ﬁghts frustration with ﬂamenco

  
 

by Natalie Bell
_Staff Writer

Yerma
Quantum Theatre
6000 Penn Ave.
Runs through April 26
$25 on Wednesdays and Sundays
$28 on Thursdays and Fridays
$30 on Saturdays

Quantum Theater brings the
unlikely combination of heartache,
longing and ﬂamenco  to-
gether in its latest production, “Ye—
rma.” . -

Federico Garcia Lorca’s play,
“Yerma,” is a heart-wrenching piece
that explores all the work’s wistful

’ HUQIICCS.

“The play is primarily about long-
ing or a primal ache for something
you cannot have and then what do
you do about that,” said director
Melanie Dreyer

The show will be performed
April 2 to 26 at 6000 Penn Ave.

The play tells the story of awom—
an named Yerma who desperately
wants a chiid of her own but, for

reasons that are only hinted at, she is
never able to conceive.

Throughout the play, she aches
for a life that she almost had, that her
Spanish honor stops her from pur-
suing. The play shows her over time
as her devastation over childlessness
increases and cuts her deeper with
every year. . _

“I think the themes are so aston-
ishingly universal We marry people
we don’t love, we long to be parents
or we long for  We long for
things that are unobtainable The rea-
son I think the play is great is that it’s

‘ about the human need for  that

are unobtainable and the deep, deep
desire that is just so unobtainable that
it drives you mad,” said Dreyer.

,  Theater, known for
its experimentation, took Lorca’s
play and added several of its own

elements to -create a show with the

companyfs unique imprint. ~

Rather than holding its shows on
a traditional stage, Quantum Theater
is known for performing in uncon-
ventional venues. Originally, Dreyer
hoped to use a stable, but after it was

clear that the facilities would be inad-
equate because of a lack of heating
and bathrooms, the company decid-
ed to use an old bank building, where
it constructed its ideal stage for the

show It’s a theater-in-the-round with

huge canvases creating a cocoon—like
effect around the audience

video images that play on the canvas-

. es. The artistic images complement

the action of the show without 
overpowering or detracting attention

ery, the forest, the barren desert and
allthesethingsarepartof theirnages
of the play and the media focuses
on these images You see them in a
pretty compelling way,” said the artis-
tic director, Karla Boos.

The addition of ﬂamenco danc-
ing is one that comes somewhat nat-
urally to Lorca’s play. Cihtli Ocampo,
the dancer, and Ethan Margolis, the
singerandmusicianofArteyPur-
e‘za Flamenco Company, provide the

ﬂamenco portion of the show that -

mingles with the plot

Ocampo parallels Yerma’s quiet
yearning with her bold and impas-
sioned ﬂamenco steps Ocampo’s
stunning  represents the
thought not spoken, the action not
done, all the wilder inner 
of Yerma’s character

“She’s repressed, she can’t have
this  and the community is

. watching all the time, and she’s full

of this life force that can’t come out,
and the ﬂamenco is perfect to access
that,” said Boos. A

Stylistically, the ﬂamenco is very

pure and gypsy-like in nature What

in the show is its improvisational na-

showcase different styles of ﬂamen-

  Asobi Seksu is more

than   meets the ear

by Alison Smyth
Staﬂ W//‘iter

Hush

Asobi Seksu

Releasedz‘ Feb. 17
Label: Polyvinyl Records
Rocks Like: Cibo

Matto, Camera Obscura,
Blonde Redhead

 

I

There’s a certain gracefulness to the for-
eign language band name. An air of mys-
tery comes attached. '

Asobi Seksu sounds innocuous enough
to American ears, but it actually means
“playful sex” in Japanese. But Asobi Sek-
su is no The F**king Eagles or even The
Pussycat Dolls. Instead, this New York
band leaves the translation to the listener.

The Japanese ﬂair attached to Hui/J,
Asobi Seksu’s third album, '
makes for more than just
dream popiat its best and a
cross-cultural modesty.

James Hanna lends his
musical talents to Yuki Chi-
kudate’s brand of edgy—ethe-
real pop. Her voice comes
out impossibly high and
resonant, making each song
sparkle in any language. Her
notes ﬂoat above the never—quite-rough
instrumentals, carrying a softness that is
never sickly sweet. .

“Familiar Light” and “In the Sky” ring
in angelic tones, but the edge makes it-
self known in the lyrics. Chikudate might
be singing notes that fall on your ears like
snowﬂakes, but it’s the talk of arsonthat

— reminds you that Asobi Seksu means busi-

ness. J

In a lower vocal register, the charm’s
still ‘there. “Me & Mary” is as infectious as
it gets, hitting the ground running with a

I drumbeat thatvstrengthens Chikudate’s soft

notes. The drums take center stage as she
sings of saying goodbye to “nappy time.”
The keyboard and sneaky English—to—Japa-
nese phrases bring to mind the Asobi Seksu
of old. i

“Glacially” shows a side of Asobi Seksu
that blends together voice and instrument
in a style that’s,a little less pop and a‘ little
more rock. It’s still sweet ascotton candy,
but this time it’s the blue kind. That’s about
as badass as cotton candy (or dream pop)
gets. ' ‘

Asobi Seksu’ is known to sing entire
songs in Japanese, as well as the occasional

/

 

E

lyric between English verses. ‘I’m' Happy
But You Don’t Like 'Me,” from Asobi
Seksu’s personal brand of power pop, {its
in perfectly with the cadence of the Japa-
nese language. On Hm/7,_“Meh No Mae”
sounds, for all intents and purposes, like J-
pop straight from the mother country. .

For all listeners know, they could be
singing, “Cheese crackers / Cheese crack-
ers,” but that doesn’t make the words any
less beautiful or emotionally charged.
That’s the anonymity of 4 the foreign lan-
guage band. A V

It’s been said that gonorrhea is one of
the most beautiful words in the English
language (according to editor and word-
srnith \X/illard R. Esipy). Why not let words
just sound beautiful? Japanese swirled with
lovely keys and soft—edge guitar in a sweet
voice sounds like heaven. Word‘ meanings
aren’t everything in the pop circuit.

There hasn’t been such ﬂawless musi-

cal multilingual fusion since
Countdown Singers’ “Nine-
ty—Nine Red Balloons.”

For most bands, it
doesn’t matter much if its
members are mult:i—ethnic,

'but for Asobi Seksu, it’s
essential. This revisits the
style of late ’90s Japanese-
American pop band Cibo
Matto (meaning “crazy

food” in Italian). ‘

The bands are alike in concept, if not
sound. \Y/hile Asobi Seksu sometimes slips
into Japanese lyrics, Cibo Matto chooses
instead to sing\about food in strange al-
most-broken English. But the comparisons

stop there because Asobi Seksu’s ‘just _a

little more dream pop and a lot less of the
spoken word-backed tunes that Cibo Matto

favors. 0

Here, Yuki Chikudate’s Japanese heri-
tage dictates the style, texture and cadence
of the music. Even its name wouldn’t be

the same without a little Japanese. Playful

Sex just doesn’t have the same ring to it as
Asobi Seksu.

Foreign band names are interesting and
colorful, but they can lead to some _mis-
communication. Just remember not to try
to ﬁnd common ground with the people
you meet on your next trip to Japan by
saying, “Hey, do you like Asobi Seksu?”
because you might be breaking a little too
much ice. j i

Start instead with Tokyo Police Club if
you’re looking for kindred music spirits. It’s
not exactly Japanese, but you can’t misin-
terpret Canadian. J

His 163 career wins is an
NCAA Division I record for
most Victories in a coach-’s first six
seasons, and he’s the Big East’s
all-time winningest coach by per-
centage in league games (.698).

Dixon beat our candidates
from other top programs, such as
Oklahoma’s Jeff Capel, Louisiana
State’s Trent Johnson and Kan-
sas’ Bill Self.

“It’s a surprise,” said Dixon.

'\While he was happy to receive
the award, Dixon stressed that it’s
most important that it helps Pitt
and allows it to continue to grow.

“It’s a good thing forour pro-
gram. To me that’s the best thing
about it,” said Dixon. “It means

a lot to our program and to our J

players.”
The award is voted on by the
Atlanta Tipoff Club’s board of

selectors, a group of basketball
writers, coaches and adrninistra—
tors. .

“Pittsburgh had a tremendous
season and much of that success
goes to Jamie and the wonder-
ful coaching job he did with that
team,” said Gary Stokan, Atlanta
Tipoff Club president. “During
his six seasons he has built a solid
program that continues to pro-
duce wonderful results, both on
and off the court.” a

Dixon is not the first Pitt
coach to win the award. His men-
tor and friend Ben Howland (now
at UCLA) won the award after the

_ 2001-02 season‘, leading the Pan-

thers to a 29-6 record and a berth
in the Sweet 16.

John Calipari won the award
last season while he was at the
University of Memphis.

Blair likely to keep eligibility

Pitt's DeJuan Blair is expected to make himself eligible for June's

NBA Draft.

by Mike Glaclysz
Sparta E3£tor

Pitt center DeJuan Blair has
made it clear he plans on going
through at least the beginning pro-
cesses of this year’s NBA Draft.
But just because he might be lean-
ing toward going professional, it
doesn’t mean Pitt will have to say
goodbye to him. V

A source close to the situation
said Blair was adamant about not
hiring an agent, meaning that if
he doesn’t like what he hears from
NBA scouts and general managers
in the upcoming months, he cagk
withdraw his name and still keep
his remaining two years of eligibil-
ity at Pitt. As soon as a player hires
an agent, his college eligibility is
exhausted.

If he does indeed enter hing
name, Blair, who turns 20 on April
22, will have until 10 days before
the Draft to withdraw. The Draft

Pitt splits pair of Big) East

 

  

I Diana Connor / Senior Staff Photographer

‘Senior Kristy Borza and Pitt split their matches against Rutgers and ‘Connecticut over

the weekend. Pitt faces Carnegie Mellon today at 4 p.m.

by Robbie K-leinmuntz
Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt tennis team showed two differ-
ent- sides of itself this weekend, sweeping
Connecticut 7-0 on Saturday but falling. to
Rutgers 6-1 the next day.

The Panthersi(11—6, 6-2 Big East) were
simply too much for the Huskies (7-9, 2-7),
who have lost theirlast three conference
matches. It was Pitt’s fifth shutout of the
season. A '

“We came out ready to win,” said senior
Christie D’Achille. “We really wanted to

. dominate them.”

Senior Ki'isty Borza and sophomore

_Elizabeth Adams plowed-through their op-

ponents at No. 1 and No. 2 singles. Borza
defeated Kelly LeRusso 6-3, 6-2, and Ad-
ams beat Ali Compitiello 6-3, 6-0. The duo
also won at N o. 1 doubles, beating LeRusso
and Emily Herb 8-4. .

The bottom four singles matches all
went three sets, with Pitt coming out victo-
rious in each. One of those matches was at
No. 4 singles, where D’Achille came back to
beat Herb 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. It was D’Achille’s
111th careerwin as a Panther.

“It took a while for me to get used to

my opponent, but then I buckled down and ‘

started attacking,” she said.

Winning every'match gave Pitt a ‘much
needed boost of conﬁdence, since it lost its
last two matches, 5-2 at Duquesne and 6-1
against Syracuse.

However, it was a. different story on
Sunday. The Panthers weren’t playing their
best tennis when they lost to a very talented

. Rutgers (1_3-4, 7-2) team.’ A '

Adams was the only Panther to win

against the Scarlet Knights, whipping
Katherine Arlak 6-0, 6-1" at No.  singles.

‘Adams’ single—season  percentage .

now stands at .760, which puts her in the
top 10 in Pitt history. I ‘ _

' Adams and Borza, who started the
season by winning their first '14 doubles
matches, have lost two of their last three
matches. Amy Zhang and Polina Zaretser
beat them 8-5 in an intense match at No.
1 doubles. . ‘

A very close match at No. 3 doubles also
didn’t go the Panthers way, as D’Achille
and junior Shannon Benic lost to Morgan
Ivey and Jennifer Holzberg_9-8(4). It’s just
‘the second loss_of the season for D’Achille
and Benic, who started out 7-0. A

“We had a few opportunities that we
could have capitalized on, but didn’t,” said
D’Achille. C

The senior also lost in two hard-fought
sets at No. 4 singles to Maryana Milchuts—

. key 7.5, 7-5.

“I was right. there the whole time.

‘I just needed a couple points here and
there. It could have gone either way,-” said‘

D’Achille.
Even with this loss, D’Achille feels the
team is not that far behind Rutgers.

“They are a good team, but I think with

some hard work we could beat them‘ if we
got a second chance,” she said. |

Pitt will travel down the street to play
Carnegie Mellon Wednesday at 4 pm.
Don’t expect the Panthers to be down and
out after Sunday’s loss. I .

. ‘‘_‘\When we lose, we just leave it on th

court and work hard for the next match,”_

said D’Achille.

position. , -

Harper has an impressive leg capable
of kicking long distances with signiﬁcant

Harper’s time with the team has been

shorter than Hutchins’, but he said he still got I

a chance to admire what Lee has done. He’s
hoping that will help him mature mentally
to become a better kicker.

“When I first got here, I tried to impress i

people with how-far I could kick and how
high, but now I’m developing into more of a
kicker and working on my accuracy,” he said.
“What Conor had comes with maturity, and
