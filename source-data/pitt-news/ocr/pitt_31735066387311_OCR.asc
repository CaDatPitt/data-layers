’Astounding’ tactic

to find area rapist

By Cassandra Burrell
Associated Press Writer

A series of rapes of elderly
women in this old steel town has

‘forced some women behind

locked doors and led at least one
to buy a gun, while police are
asking most black men in town
to be fingerprinted to prove their
innocence. ’ -

The American Civil Liberties

V Union has called the fingerprint

tactic ”astounding.”

Police Chief Chris Kelly, claim-
ing support from residents, has
ordered. officers door-to-door in
this Pittsburgh suburb of about
5,000 to interview people for
clues and ask for fingerprints.

”We just can't sit back now,”
Kelly said. ”How do you tell an
80-year-old victim's family that I

was thinking of doing this, but I-

was worried about the flak I'd
get° They don't want to hear
about flak.” '

Kelly says very few men have
refused to be fingerprinted when
asked. He said police have ac-
cumulated about 115 fingerprint
sets so far.

Six women living alone, all be-
tween 64 and 85 years of age,
have been raped since 1983, in-
cluding four this year. One
76-year-old woman, the rapist’s
only black victim, was attacked
in her home April 24 and raped
in her home Aug. 25, Kelly said.

The women live within a five-
minute walk of each other in this

The Towers cafeteria has estab-
lished a new policy requiring all
students to check their book bags
or large purses before entering
the dining facilities, said Joe Czol-
nik, student manager of the
cafeteria.

”A lot of stuff was being sto-
len,” said Czolnik. ”Some syste
had to be made.” 1

According to Czolnik, the
checking system is expected to
be a permanent one.

He went on to say that the sys- ,

tem was created by Donovan
Hughes, director of the Housing
and Food Service.

Hughes and Peter Rix, Gener-
al Manager of the cafeteria were

town once notorious as the place
where seven steelworkers were
shot to death during a strike
against steel magnate Andrew
Carnegie in 1892.

Police are looking for a muscu-
lar black man between the ages
of 16 and 60. Kelly said police
have fingerprints and other evi-
dence tying the attacks to one
man.

The rapist has covered his vic-
tims’ heads with bedsheets so
descriptions of him have been
sketchy, but the women agree he
is black, Kelly said.

”We think hemay be some-
body" respectable, somebody
who is very emotionally dis-
turbed but responsible for his ac-
tions,-somebody who is normal
on the outside and able to func-
tion within the community,” Kel-
ly said Monday.

Kelly said the door-to-door can-
vass has covered about half the
town in a little more than _ a
month, he said.

”I know it's never been done
before,” he said. ’’It was a very
hard decision to make. I've taken
an extreme amount of bad pub-
licity for it and pressure, but the
people are not complaining. 

’’If you don't live in this com-
munity, you don’t know what the
people are going through.”

More than 300 California Na-
tional- Guardsmen were called
out Wednesday to help in hard-
hit Tuolumne County, along with
aircraft and 90 trucks, said Guard

spokeswoman Sgt. CaroIyn_

Hamilton.

The fires in tinder-dry Oregon, I

California and Idaho forced scat-

.. threatened rural communities.

One fire in Washington forced
evacuation of a state park.
Lightning-spawned fires had
charred 89,115 acres of brush
and timber by today in northern
California, swelling by 20,000
acres in less than 24 hours.
“There are now 910 fires go-

The biggest single fire, in the
central ldahomountains, was a
blaze that flared up and doubled
in size in one day to 15,000 acres
after being left to burn itself out.

Thousands of dollars
worth of stamps gone

WASHINGTON —- Misprinted
stamps worth thousands of dol-

CIA employees who took/ 86

The CIA is investigating the

nine employees for using their
government positions for private
profit, The Washington Post
reported in its Wednesday
edition. ' '

One sheet of 400 of the mis-
printed $1 stamps was produced,

according to the Bureau of Print-

ing and Engraving, when it was

a collectors’ publication and a

Latchkey kids have

poorer performance

WASHINGTON —— Most pub-
lic school teachers in a national

survey rated the widespread prac- I

tice of Ieavingchildren on their
own after school as the biggest
cause of youngsters’ difficulties in
the classroom.

Parents questioned separately
for the Louis Harris and Associ-
ates survey also expressed con-
cern about the Iatchkey child
phenomenon, which has spread
as more and more parents take
jobs outside the home.

Forty-one percent of the 2,000
parents surveyed said they leave
their child on his or her own be-
tween the end of school and 5:30
p.m. at least once a week.

Campus officials
trying to shorten
the wait in lines

By David Ballarotto
Staff Writer

Pitt students are back on cam-
pus and back in line, but office
managers are doing their bestto
help accomodate them.

Most students are now taking V

care of the paperwork necessary
for loans, financial aid and pay-
ing their bill. In order to process
the paperwork, students must
wait in line.

Sophomore Barry Sedor says
he cannot understand the situa-
tion. ”Everywhere you go, you
gotta stand in line. What are you
gonna do?”

After seeing the length of some
of the campus lines, many stu-
dents have decided to avoid wait-

_ ing by quitting the. line. ”I just

gave up on it,” said Pitt senior
Greg Rich.
Phil Everett, a junior informa-

tion science major, said he feels
the same way. ’’I refused to stand
in line. I went to the registrar's
office and that was coming out
the door. The admissions line
was pretty long, too. About 45
minutes.”

CGS student Mary Yates said
she had to stand in line for near-
ly an hour at the Office of Admis-
sions and Financial Aid. ”I sat
there and waited. When I stepped
up to the lady she said I couldn't
get through because I didn't have
the forms with me.”

’ The students complaints are
not falling on empty ears. Lisa
Geyer, Counselor at Admissions
and Financial Aid said their office
is trying hard to accomodate the
students. ”We’ve doubled the
number of people at the counter
to six. If we could fit more peo-
ple we’d put ’em behind the

- counter.”

longer, though.

Hoping to be of more service
to the student body, the Cashiers’
office in Thackeray "Hall has
several methods of paying bills
that avoid lines altogether.

”You can pay by mail, we have
new depositories and envelopes
you just drop into the deposito-
ry,” said Pat Warnick, manager of
the Cashiers’ office. That office
also has expanded hours on Tues-
days and Wednesdays until 6:45

MANAMA, Bahrain — Iranian gunboats
attacked a cargo ship and an oil tanker
Wednesday and Iraq said its jets hit two
tankers in a dramatic escalation of the
3-year-old Persian Gulf ”tanker war.”

Three other tankers were hit by Iranian
ships Tuesday night, gulf shipping sources
and Lloyd's of London insurers said. A
Cypriot tanker was struckby Iraqi jets

In Paris Wednesday, Defense Minister
Andre Giraud said France has ordered

three warships into the gulf area to help .

ordered into the region of Khor al—Fakkan,

U.S. warships have been escorting
Kuwaiti tankers, reflagged with the Stars
and Stripes, through the gulf since luly 20.

In the latest Iranian attack, at least three
Iranian speedboats opened fire on the

I 97,286-ton Greek tanker Dafni off the

northern Saudi Arabian coast near Farsi
island, marine salvage executives said.
Casualties and damage were not known,
they said.

It was the fifth such attack reported in

The Iranian attacks today followed Ira-
qi ‘strikes Tuesday on South Korean,

ping sources and Lloyd's of London in-

The five strikes were the most by Iran

Russians put West German

youth on trial for air antics

MOSCOW -— The West German teen-
ager whose daring flight to Red Square
shook up the Soviet defense establish-
ment admitted to a Soviet court Wednes-
day that he broke the law in the ”greatest
mistake” of his life.

Mathias Rust, a 19-year-old amateur pi-
lot, faces up to 10 years in prison on
charges of violating Soviet airspace and
flight rules and ”malicious hooliganism.”

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 3, I987

After the charges were read, Rust told
the judge, ’’I am aware of my guilt,” but
later said he did not acknowledge guilt
on the charge of malicious hooliganism
because he had no intention of harming
anyone. He defended his flight as a peace
mission. , I

Rust, looking pale but speaking in a
firm voice, tried to explain his goals dur-
ing almost five hours of testimony on the
opening day of his three-day trial for the
May 28 flight.

He said he wanted to meet with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss a
new political system that would bring East
and West together in ’’full democracy,
democracy in the fullest sense of the
word.”

Under questioning from his Soviet law-
yer, Vsevolod Yakovlev, Rust told the
court that with the perspective of the last
14 weeks in Lefortovo prison, he realizes
that his approach was wrong.

”I threatened the lives of people. That's
my opinion today. I will never repeat it,”
he said..

Gulf tension mounts as Iran-Iraq war goes on

many as 62 people may have been killed
in the St.’ Helena gold mine explosion and
elevator plunge, which the mine manager
said was probably caused by methane
gas. -

The General Min_in_g Union Corp.,

‘ which owns thegmine,‘ Iéad reported previ-

ously that 10 men were confirmed dead
and another 40 were ini-the elevator and
presumed dead.

But company chairman Steve Ellis said
today that 12 employees of a contracting
company may have’been in the elevator
that fell to the bottom of the shaft as a
result of theexplosion.

Only one of the bodies has been recov-
ered. Mine manager Gary Maude said
Tuesday that methane gas ”was one of the
more likely possibilities” for the cause of

_ the explosion.

Meanwhile, two major newspapers to-
day called for a crackdown on right-wing
terrorism following a series of attacks on
black trade union offices.

The explosion Mondaysevered a cable
and sent an elevator crashing to the bot-
tom of the 4,521-foot shaft at the St. Hele-
na gold mine in Welkom, 138 miles south
of Johannesburg.

The bodies of~l0 other miners not in
the elevator have been located. Five in-
jured miners were rescued.

Codes

on again
for summer
students ,

By Mark::,R. Brown ‘I -

Staff Writer

Pitt students who lived in the
dorms over the summer will now
be able to use their access codes
to make calls from campus

g phones after having to spend a

week without them.

The access codes were termi-
nated with no prior warning for
at least a week beginning Aug.
22.

The Student Telephone Service
provides the phone service for
residents of University of Pitts-
burgh dormitories and certain
campus offices.

The emergency number 911,
on-campus and toll-free phone
calls could still be dialed out,
however.

Bruce Hutchinson, manager of
the Office of Telecommunica-
tions (which supports the STS net-

" work on campus), said ”This is

the third year running that sum-
mer residents have had their
phone usage interrupted. .

”This is an annual event. It is
standard policy to shut down our
office for a week at the end of
each summer. We need this peri-
od to regroup for the fall students
[estimated at no less than 5,000
new access codes to be assigned].
We are able to clear our com-
puters of old access codes to pre-
vent them from being passed on
and abused. Like a credit card
number,‘ it is important that con-
fidentiality is maintained,” said
Hutchinson.

Hutchison also said the Office
is working on installing a more ef-
fective system for next year. He
said they-have tried to send out
flyers in the past to warn cus-
tomers that service would tem-
porarily be suspended, but this
method was ineffective because
most of the flyers ended up be-
ing thrown out, unread.

”Technically speaking, the dor-
mitories are closed during the
end of August. While I'm aware
that some students were incon-
venienced, it's difficult for us to
contact each of them. Some are
away on vacation, or keep irregu-
lar hours.” said Hutchinson.

He said that while university
operators would not assist STS

users, in extreme hardship cases, _

students could place outgoing
calls by calling the Housing
Office or Campus Public Safety."

Film industry cleaning up fall image

By Michele Kiraly

Contributing Editor

Just as the fashion industry's fall
flair brings clothes with more,
(literally more as in more materi-
al) to cover tanned bodies with
wool for chilly nights, the film in-
dustry is in line, too.

Just as shorts and tanks are
replaced with slacks and sweat-
ers, a classier and more refined
cinema is offered in the fall. Since
filmmaking is an art and not an
adventure in special effects, there
are no low—budget comedies or
high-budget horror stories offered
in this pack.

Here is azlist of a classier cine-
ma scheduled for New York

. releases. lronweed is a change of

face for Jack Nicholson. We saw
him last as a devil (The Witches
of Eastwick), and here he stars

- all night.

”l’ve bought a gun,” said one
65-year-old woman who asked
not be be identified because of
fear of attack. ”l don't know how
to use it, but my nephew and his
daughter, who's an ex-
policewoman, are going to teach
me.  I've also had a phone in-
stalled right near my_ bed this
week.”

Nathaniel Richardson, 20, who
is black, said he has known one
of the victims for most of his life
and wouldn't mind giving his fin-
gerprints.

’’I don't think it's right, but why
give police a hass|e°” he said.

The ACLU said the mass finger-
printing violates constitutional
rights.

”They’ve got it a little back-
ward. In this country, you are pre-
sumed innocent. You do not
have to prove your innocence.
The government has to prove
you're guilty,” said Marion Da-
mick, associate director of the
Greater Pittsburgh ACLU chapter.

”We are as anxious as anybody

that police solve the crime. But .

we believe they're asking people
to give up their valuable right to
be left alone.  lt’s—astounding/"
she said. ”This is a voluntary

. thing, but there is nothing really

voluntary about it. How many
people really won't do what the
police ask them to do°”

Study shows big percentage
of job applications falsified 

By Malcolm Ritter
AP Science Writer

A third ofapplicants lied about
their experience in applying for
a job, according to a recent study.
Researchers say well-designed
questionnaires and the use of
computers could help prevent
such deceit.

The study found that 76 of 221
applicants ”claimed to have ex-
perience performing a non-
existent task,” said Ron Pannone,
supervisor of personnel research
for the Port Authority of New
York and‘ New Jersey.

Studies elsewhere have found
falsification in biographical ques-
tionnaires by up to 67 percent of
applicants, and Pannone said
responses can be so easily faked’
that the bi—state agency does not

use such questionnaires in hiring. _

He and other researchers dis-
cussed the problem Tuesday at
the.annual meeting of the Ameri-
can Psychological Association.

One way tocombat falsifica-
tion is to ask questions for which
the "’right’.answer is not obvious,
Pannone said.

Such ”empiricall»y based”
questions are developed by ex-
tensive testing that finds correla-
tions between a desired
characteristic and answers to
questions that seem unrelated.
Those questions can then be used
in -a questionnaire as an index for
measuring the characteristic,
withoutgiving away the ”right”

answer.
V Another step entails warnings
on the questionnaire that falsifi-

cation will be detected, he said." i
_ Giving tests by computer could
help circumvent another falsifica-7

tion problem, cheating by recruit-
ers who want -to help job
applicants score highly on bio-
graphical questionnaires, said
psychologist Terry Mitchell.
That kind of falsification may
cost the life insurance industry

One way’ to combat
falsification is to ask
questions for which the
’right’ answer is not
obvious.

$30 million a year or more,
through investment in people
hired through falsification and
who later fail on the job, he said.
A computer program designed
to fight recruiter cheating is be-
ing tested, said Mitchell, associ-
ate scientist in_ agent selection
services at the -Life Insurance Mar-
keting and Research Association
(LIMRA) in Farmington, Conn.
The association provides a bi-
ographical hiring questionnaire
designed to predict potential suc-
cess inlife insurance sales. An es-
timated l3 million people have
take.n some form of it, including
about 75 percent of current life

insurance agentsin the United
States and Canada, Mitchell said.

Deceit by applicants- is usually
not a problem with empirically
based questionriaires like the
LIM-RA test, and cheating by life

‘ insurance industry recruiters ap-

pears to be done by only a ”small
but highly motivated group,” he
said. ’

Recruiters in any industry may
cheat to get an applicant hired if
they feel pressured by hiring quo-
tas and frustrated that applicants
they favor are notpassing such a
test, Mitchell said.

Recruiters may coach an appli-f

cant on how to answer some
questions, he said. To discover
helpful answers on the test, some
recruiters have systematically
filled out and submitted bogus
answer sheets to see how various

answers affect the score, he said.‘

Other tricks include having

”ringers” take the test in place of.

the applicant, copying from
previous answer sheets that got
high scores, or letting an appli-
cant take the test repeatedly un-
til he passes. ‘

But a computer_'can routinely

scramble the order of questions '

or ask new questions based on

answers to previousones, which .
makes it harder to copy answers

from a previous answer sheet,
Mitchell said. ‘

It may also detect falsification
if an applicant takes too long or
too brief a time to answer_a
question.

IFC PRESIDENT
T

s president of the Inter-
fraternity Council, I

would like to extend a

. warm welcome to in
coming freshmen and a welcome
back to returning upperclassmen.

Grow up

ast June Irealized I was
just about to turn 20
years old and couldn't
remember anything be
fore my sixth birthday. Even the
events between my seventh and
10th birthday were hazy and frag-
mented. All the softball games,
birthday parties and Halloween

. trick-or—treating were gradually

fading from me. I was getting old

I decided to search for my long
lost past. I became an Indian
Springs Day Camp counselor.

It was the perfect opportunity.
I would be paid to go swimming,
boating, fishing and play kickball.
l pitied my other friends working
in offices and restaurants; they
wouldn't be able to regain their
childhood or get a tan.

On the morning of my first day,
for the first time in three years, I

i woke up at 7:30 a.m. After gulp-

Since all of us were freshmen at
one time, we can relate to the
hectic time Orientation brings
about. Meeting Dr. Posvar, at-
tending last-minute orientation
meetings, parading through the
Activities Fair with arms ”fu|l-o-
stuff" and, last but not least, we
were all asked, as all freshmen
were asked this year, to attend
”The Watermelon Picnic.”

' By following our fold-out maps
and with blue folders in hand, we
venture to the side of the Cath-
edral. As we turn the corner next
to the Stephen Foster Memorial,
we are overwhelmed by a sea of
young men and women all bear-
ing some type of Greek letters
across their chests.

As a freshman, I wasn't really
sure what I was getting myself
into by descending into this sea
of fraternity men and sorority
women. I found myself confused
as to whether Phi Beta Who or Pi
Kappa Whatever had the best

soccer team, or Kappa ‘Kappa
Who or Delta Phi What the best-
looking women.

However, among this sea of
Greeks are some of Pitt's most
prestigious leaders — Student
Government Board president, the
student organizer for Homecom-
ing, the director of Lantern Night,
Greek Week co-chairman, the
president of Order of Omega.
Along with these leaders you will
find fraternity men and sorority
women in R«OTC, Greek mentors
and Greeks among The Pitt News
staff, along with Greeks as mem-
bers of various other campus
groups.

Some freshmen will leave the
Watermelon Picnic and have a
fine four years at Pitt. The ones
that stay and pledge will find a
certain permanence here at the
university that no one, not even
the evil graduation monster, can
take away from them. There is
permanence because you will

 Where history meets an education

develop friendships ‘on a firmer
and more lasting basis. Ten years
from now, you will be able to
bring your children back for
Homecoming and be able to
show off your old fraternity pic-
tures at the chapter house. As a
fraternity or sorority alumnus,
you will be able to create change
and improvement within your

chapter —- something that few are .

able to do as Pitt alumni in
general. '

You must remember that many
will wear the Pitt logo, but few
decide to wear or are chosen to

wear the letters of a fraternity or I

sorority. As Interfraternity Coun-
cil president, I confidently

believe there is an appropriate"

fraternity at Pitt for every incom-
ing man, and so I welcome every
freshman male to participate in
Rush in an attempt to make your-
self a permanent fixture of the
University of Pittsburgh and of
your chosen fraternity.

ing three cups of coffee and two
bowls of Cap’n Crunch cereal, I
was ready to pick up my carpool
of kids. '
Arriving at my first stop, I was
greeted by a very. weary-looking
young lady wearing a bathrobe,
with a four—year—old bawling girl
clinging to her leg. The lady
yawned a ’’hello’’ to me, seat-
belted her daughter, kissed her
goodbye and dragged herself
back to her house. h P
For my second stop, I was hop-
ing for a little warmer reception.
I pulled into the driveway,
honked the horn, and two
screaming 7-year-old boys
dashed out the door of the house
with their mother chasing after
them. The boys were friendly and
welcomed me with punches to
my knees. The mother was very
helpful by reminding me 10

times of the speed limit and the

previous year's highway accident
statistics. .

We soon arrived at the camp
parking lot when the 4-year-old
in the back seat threw up.

In spite of these discouraging
events, I was determined to keep
my positive attitude. My bunk as-
signment consisted o_f 16 six-
year-olds. '

Throughout the day, we went
swimming and played t-ball,
dodgeball and soccer.

I was reminded of the thrill of
being picked first for soccer and
the agony of being picked last for

»t—ball. I fished and ate peanut but-

ter and jelly-for lunch. Watching
the kids, I remembered how easy
it was to make best friends in a
day.

When camp was over, my kids
went to their drivers and waved
goodbye. They probably thought
that camp would last forever.

I just went home and took a
nap.

Peace, love and pop consciousness  

ritish rocker Elvis Costel-
lo asked once in a song:
”What’s so funny about
peace love and
understanding?” Personally, I
find nothing funny about it at all.
Can you think of a better credo
to live by? What strikes me as fun-
ny, however, is how little we un-
derstand. about the process
necessary for moving toward
such an ideal. ‘

Throughout the 19605 and, to
a lesser degree, the early 1970s,
pop musiciansjassumed the role
of America's conscience.’ While
their work didn't create the so-
ciopolitical tumult of those times,
it certainly interpreted the‘ situa-
tion for us, expressing our feel-
ings as a whole and exposing us
for what we were — complacent
and more than a little bit scared.

Today, in reaction to the

amorality and obnoxiousness-

which is reflected back at us in
the forms of, among others,
Madonna, The Beastie Boys and
Motley Crue, conscientious

young Americans _are quick to -

cling to artists such as U2 and
Bruce Springsteen. The seeming-
ly intrepid, ”socially relevant”
stances of such artists, when
flanked by hordes of mindless
nymphs and sexist jerks, provide
a bit of comfort following the
realization that America has gone
superficialto the max.

But consider the media which

JEFF
SEWALD
BETWEEN THE LINES

carry pop music's messages —
MTV and rock radio — and their
respective audiences.'With super-
ficiality and commercialism on
all fronts, what relevant effect
could U2 or Bruce Springsteen
possibly have on society? In my
opinion, the answer is little, or
none.

Like it or not, the avenues for
promoting relevant sociopolitical
change in America are two: Bus-
iness and/or politics. Business
and politics are what drive this
and most nations. The only way
positive change stands a chance
of being realized is by increasing
the number of conscientious peo-
ple working within the business
and political arenas. '

 

--Cynics, go ahead and laugh.
Perhaps conscientiousness is not
compatible with either business
or politics. But instead of scoffing,
show me the alternative. Some’-
times it's necessary to pray for a
miracle. No one can tell me that
standing on the fringes with a
beer in your hand screaming
”Born In The U.S.A." is going to
be taken seriously by any’ person
or group powerful enough_to ef-
fect meaningful change. No mat-
ter how many times U2 performs
”Sunday, Bloody Sunday," the
bloodshed continues in Northern
Ireland.

Pop stars will never individual-
ly or collectively be able to
directly elicit sociopolitical
change. Regardless of their level
of sincerity, these people are too
few in number and, for the most
part, too narrow in scope. Most
lack an understanding of the sys-
tem and the means by which that
system may be shaped.

”Peace, love and understand-
ing” must be made less abstract
and translatable into terms which
are understood in business and
political circles. The smart activist
will show a large corporation
how a more healthful product
can still be profitable. If this is
done, perhaps such ideas will be-
come part of the system, even if
their part is small, instead of an
outsideforce impinging on it.

It is difficult ‘for me to believe

that Bruce Springsteen or U2's
Bono Vox, given their ideals, be-
liefs andseriouskconcerns about
political and social issues, would
prefer inspiring a young person to V
become a, pop musician instead
of a concerned businessman or -‘
political figure. Such a process I
would be" self—defeating. One
generation of troubadours begets
another generation of trouba-
dours which begets another
generation of troubadours. What
does it all add up to? The idea,
as I see it, is to inspire talented
people to become involved in the
process of society. We've heard
enough screaming from the back-
yard. If you really want to have
impact, you have to talk at the
dinner table. People of lesser
character have been doing so for
ages. It's time the table turns a bit.
In defense of the socially rele-
vant pop star -— raising con-
sciousness is laudable. But no
matter how sincere and selfless a -
person like Bob Geldof may be,
his comrades and, ultimately, his
followers, will let him down.
People are still starving in Ethio- -
pia. What happened to the ”Live
Aid” message? I suspect it took
on the characteristics of today's
pop music scene. Once thepoint.
was reached where something of
substance had to be done there
wasn't a soul to be. found.)

Study amongthepeople of the world

omemay find it strange
that in an issue devoted
to welcoming freshmen,
I'm making a plug for
leaving the university. I'm not

talking about renouncing this‘
- ”bastion of higher education,” I

am advocating a temporary
leave-of-absence in the shape of
study abroad. —

I remember with a startling
clarity the feelings I had after I
stepped off the fourth and final
plane that carried me the last leg
of my trip to France — I felt, God
forbid, like a freshman.

The journey began in early
January. In fact, my stomach
hadn't yet recovered from a New
Year's Eve party, which had
turned into an emotional farewell
to all my friends. It wasn't until
later that I realized my nerves had
a lot to do with that upset
stomach. (Denial is_ one of my
strongest defenses sometimes. I
had convinced ‘myself that I
would take to foreign travel like
a yuppie to Perrier. Leaving my
home would be the proverbial
piece of cake.)

I learned a lot about trans-
continental travel in the 48 hours‘
it took me to get from Pittsburgh
to Cannes. It was seven airports
and five countries from start to
finish and, almost needless to say,
my luggage took a detour along
the way. It was a full week later
before it caught up to.me  just
when I had gotten used to the
idea of buying a new wardrobe
in France.

. After a month-long orientation
period on the Riviera, I-was off to

DEBORAH
KAUFMAN

,Paris. All the cliched school-girl

fantasies were with me on that
north-bound train. There are
honestly no words to describe
how I felt that night as I traversed
the City of Light in a taxi bound
for my ”family’s” apartment. I'm
sure the driver got a chuckle out
of my attempts to comment on
the sights en francais as we
crossed the most scenic parts of
the city.

I was. one of the luckier stu-
dents when it came to living
arrangements. Students studying
abroad sometimes board with
families, often single parents,
widows or older couples whose
children have left home. My
family, though, was complete
with two older children — warm
and welcoming, considerate and
sometimes ‘concerned.

The Ferals were also noble, as
in royally descended. That fact
allowed me to experience things
that the typical foreign student
‘doesn't: I‘ travelled to their coun-

' itry :_c,hatea’u.Ig ('1}5f5bedrooms) for a

weekend, I lhobnobbed with
colonels, generals and higher-ups
in the Ministry of Defense and,
the piece de resistance, I met
President Mitterand at an awards
ceremony where Monsieur Feral.
received the National'Order of
Merit. “

Besides those events that)

caused me to write ‘home with’

more school-girl enthusiasm, I
experienced the day-to-day life of
another culture. It was simply liv-
ing in that foreign environment
that left such an impression on an
impressionable mind, even more
so than the many memorable
events that highlighted my trip.

And there were so many of
those memorable events. I prob-
ably chose one of the worst times
to study abroad. The value of the

‘dollar was at a new low; interna-

tional terrorism and anti-
American sentiment reached new
heights. But that was half the fun.
(My mother loses sleep when I
say things like that.) I got to dodge
bombs, meet Libyans, travel to
the Soviet Union_— all the things
a semester abroad should

I include. A

In my opinion, there is simply
no better way to learn about
yourself‘ than to study abroad.
Yes, you learn the obvious: a for-
eign language, foreign customs,
international etiquette. But more
than that, you discover parts of
yourself that were perhaps hid-
den under the cloak of_ familiarity.

The timel spent in France was

a turning point for me..,.l_t was the.
first time in my life that I was able

to trulybelmyself. Before I left
everything and everyone behind,
I had always been defined by
those things and those people —
my parent's daughter, a Pitt stu-
dent, a business major, my
boyfriend's‘ girlfriend, my sib-

lings’ sister.,There were a num- ‘

ber of different roles, but I was

‘(always me in." relation. to,some-
thing else. ’ -

1.

Going away from all of that let
me define who I was on my own-
terms. In many ways, it was a’ lot
like my freshman year all over
again. Although people would
have you believe that being a
freshman is the lowest of pursuits,
it allows you certain inalienable
rights: the right to use a map and
look silly, the right to walk
around looking generally con-
fused, the right to experience
things for the first time.

’ Going away is something
everyone should do ——-even ‘if
you aren't a language major.
There are experiences for every- ‘-
one: sights, tastes (be courageous
-— everyone should try tripe at
least once), sounds, smells (avoid
small, enclosed, populated areas,
and keep an open mind, not an
open nose), feelings. What you
can get out of it is a lot more than
proficiency in a language.

”lt’s absolutely amazing,”said
Hook. “You play old songs to
them, and they think you're play-
ing new stuff. Most of them know
even less aboutjoy Division. It's
sad.”

However, the old bands are
producing some new music. The
Echo and the Bunnymen album

V (aptly titled Echo and the Bunny-

men) was released lastjuly.-”Lips
like Sugar,” ”When You're
Strange” and ”Rollercoaster” are
currently receiving frequent air-
play on WXXP, but not all of the
songs are on the album.

The new release by the Bunny-
men is expected to surpass the
success of their Ocean Rain LP
and ”Bring on the Dancing
Horses.”

Echo and the Bunnymen, with
their haunting lyrics and melod-
ic guitar, are redefining the mus-
ic scene. Both they and New
Order combine catchy tunes with
insightful lyrics. Mindless dance
music it's not. - ,

New Order's summer release,
Substance, is a relatively com-
mercial compilation of the band's
hits. Don't worry, though, a new
single, ”True Faith,” has been
released prior to the album.

It .seems odd that two big
names would have to combine
forces for a show. But, the bands
are old friends and admirers of
each other’s music.

Firs and Goal  

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

PROVO, Utah — The Pitt Pan-
thers got off to a shaky start, to say
the least, against Brigham Young
in front of a crowd of 64,374 in
Cougatr Stadium last night. They
quickly rcovered to knock off the
Cougars, 27-17, in the season
opener for both, teams, which
‘was televized nationally on
ESPN. .

The Panthers won the coin toss‘

and elected to kick off. That the- 6

ory backfired, though, as BYU
needed only one play and 16 se-
conds to get_into".th‘e endzone.
J With the ball on the 27 yard
line, Cougar quarterback Bob Jen-
sen rolled to hisright and found‘
split end Richard Zayas, at Pitt's
40 yard line. Panther free safety
Troy Washington missed a tack-
le and Zayas, who scampered in
for the score. The extra pointwas
good, giving BYU a 7-0 lead. '
Pitt's first three offensive.drives
all went for naught._ The closest
Pitt came to scoring was when
kicker Jeff Van Horne attempted
a 40 yard field goal with 6:30 re-
maining in the‘ 'opening”‘quartef,
but the kick was wide left.
Meanwhile, the Panther
defense tightened up and quiet-
ed the BYU offense. After Van
Horne’s miskick BYU lost 10

yards on three plays and was _

forced to punt from deep within
its own territory. ’
Pitt took over at the Cougars’

47-yard line. The Panthers, 'as_.:.

BYU had done earlier, wasted lit-
tletime finding the endzone. Pitt

.quartefback Sal Genilla threw a

perfect bomb to Hosea Heard,
who had beaten his man deep

. down the sideline.

Heard gathered the ball in at
the five-yard line and went in for
the score. Van Horne’s kick tied
the score 7-7 with 5:18 left in the
quarter. “

Pitt completely dominated the _

second quarter. The Panthers
took the lead for good, 14-7,
when Genilla found sophomore
wide receiver Reggie Williams all

' alone in the end, zone for a 30

yard score with 11:09 left in the

half. 1

BYU took the ensuing kickoff
and drove from its own 28-yard
line to the Pitt 28, but on a third
down in seven play linebacker
Zeke Gadson sacked Jenson for
a 14- yard loss, forcing the Cou
gars to punt. .

Mike Gottfried. ”We felt a little

Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther wideouts —
everybody around campus
knows about Reggie Williams
and Billy Osborne and Michael
Stewart. Not a flashy group, but
a steady one (although quite in-

jury prone, as 1986 revealed);

Williams the deep threat, Os-
borne the possession receiver,
and’ Stewart the in—betweener.
So you think you know these
guys now, right? Well, here's a
not-so—familiar name that, if the
good work is kept up, could hit

Tuten’s the name, snagging

down the lane could be a ”hel—
lo” to fame. He's who many are

’ calling the surprise of Pitt's fall

football camp.

A sleight of scale 6-foot, 175
pound receiver, Henry Tuten
hails from Camden, N.J., a
coaches candy store in terms of
outstanding football and basket-
ball talents. '

”There were, and still are, a lot
of great athletes from my area. As
a matter of fact,” said Tuten, ”two
guys who played for Pitt, [corner-

back] Michael Hadley and [form-'

er Panther] Lorenzo Freeman

kinda talked me into signing with
the University of Pittsburgh. Of
course, meeting Coach Gottfried

- and his staff was the icing on the

cake,” he admits in a half—serious,
half—obligated tone.

Tuten recalls another athlete
from his area, one who almost
convinced him to take the next
plane from Jersey that was head-
ed for America's breadbasket. ‘

”Mike Rozier— you remember
him,” he says in a well-hidden
sarcastic way. ”Mike and I are
good friends, and he was going
crazy trying to get me to sign with
Nebraska. I

”And I almost did, but Michael
and Lorenzo (who both along

,.

with Rozier, attended the same
high school as Tuten) were a bit
more persuasive,” he laughs.
Tuten enters the 1987 Panther
campaign as a sophomore, the

result of an NCAA rule known as .
Proposition 48. Yet, he insists, his;
academic sidehas taken a turn ’

for the better.

”My ‘grades just weren't good
enough to play last season. I be-
lieve I concentrated too much on
athletics in high school. But I
worked hard last year, stayed
here at Pitt over the summer and
took some classes, and now I’m
on the right track academically.

”Sitting out a year was kinda
painful, but Reggie [Williams]

  Sophomore Tuten up and coming receiver

kept telling me the year would be

up quick. But I never thought it _..;-

would go by this quick -— here it
is fall camp, and I'm still thinking
it's summer..’.’,

Panthers receiver's coach Steve
Coury is delighted that fall camp
has come around, for now he gets
to develop ;tJ:ie' raw talent and
”outstanding potential” that he
sees in Tuten.‘

”Henry is having an excellent
camp. We like his attitude, his
work ethic, but there are so many
things about. him that can't be
taught —— particularly his body
control. Sitting out a year did hurt
his hand/eye coordination and
field sense,” Coury admits, ”but
that will come around the longer
we practice.” ,

”I think he's gonna be a great
one.”

Strong words, indeed, but
somewhat too strong for Coury to
be just blowing smoke; the Pan-
ther wide receivers, in past sea-
sons a weak factioniof the squad,
"could dominate with the emer-
gence of Tuten.

Football wasn't the only sport
Tuten excelled at while attending

"Woodrow Wilson High School;

he was a three—year letterman in
basketball. I

”That was really my game. I
was baaaad in basketball; I could
dunk any way.’ Georgetown, St.
Joe's and Iowa all wanted, me to
play ball for them.” '

But why football instead of
roundball?

THE PITT NEWS, Thursd'ay,'Se'pfénibér"3, I987

 

Arenabowl locale waswin enough for fans

By Eric Poole

Staff Writer

For the first time in almost eight
years, a professional sports cham-
pionship took place in Pittsburgh.

And, for the first time in 60
years, a teamifrom Pittsburgh lost"
a professional sports final.

By the way, the team 60 years
ago was the Pittsburgh Pirates,
and there was no shame in their
defeat at the hands of the ”Mur—
derer’s Row” 1927 New York

. Yankees. R

It's kind of doubtful that the
1987 Denver.Dynamite will find

‘themselves a place insports his-

tory next to the '27 Yanks, but the
Dynamite’s 45-16 victory over
the Pittsburgh Gladiators
represents another first in what
couldbe the successful continu-
ous experiment that is Arenaball.

The main complaint among the

13,232 fans in attendance at the ‘

Civic Arena was that the Gladia-
tors lost. Aside from that, the Pitts-
burgh fans seemed to be very
excited by the game that Jim
Foster invented in 1981 while
watching an indoor soccer game.

”|t’s everything he [Foster]
wanted when he started this
game,” said Stan Zielinski, who
attended all four arena games in
Pittsburgh. . ’

Zielinski said that he would be
back to see the "Gladiators next
season but that there should be
an‘ improvement in the playing
surface. I

The turf was the same surface ‘
t used by the now—defunct Pitts-

.     ‘:27
ix . as lg.”

" I -’.'-urn ... Q
. .4

. /‘A’
J“, .  J
l‘l\"\t“\gl/ ,7” / I

I‘ ‘OI-

burgh Spirit. All season, there
were problems with a series of
wrinkles near both sidelines at
midfield (the 25-yardline), and
the seams on the 5-yard-wide
strips of turf were often kicked
up.
”The [arena] league is going to
make it, that's obvious. They can
afford to spend money to get ‘a
good playing surface,” said Zie-

Iinsky. ”|’ve seen it [the condition '

of the playing surface] affect the
outcome of some plays.”

Bob Conroy, a former semi-pro
player, characterized the game as
having ”good hitting and good
play selection, at least by
Denver.” _

Like Zielinski, Conroy, a Penn
Hills resident, said that he would
”definitely” see some games next

season. ,
Due mostly to the smaller field,
passing has become the mainstay
on the Arenaball offense, with the
running game relegated to the
status of the gadget play. A
.None of the four arena teams
averaged more than 48 yards
rushing per game. The Gladiators
finished last in the league in this
respect with 8.8 yards a game.

‘-514.,’ .3

Kevin Mclntyre, a hairstylist at

Hair Friends in Oakland, ad-
dressed the possibility of making
the running game
prominent. .

”|n touch football, sometimes - I’

you have this rule that you have
to run the ball at least once every
four downs. It should be manda-
tory to run the ball a‘ certain num-
ber of times a game.”

Krugwins age group at Masters Tournament

‘By Beth Froelich

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt diving coach Julian Krug

I always tries to impress upon his

divers the values of believing in
yourself and the ability you have
to accomplish whatever goals
your set.

These qualities are essential for

41. ..oq- wot!

a diver’s success. They echo

through the athelete’s mind day V

in and day out at practice. And,
in times of frustration and doubt,
they offer some consolation.
But, as time wears on, words
become empty, and atheletes
tend to question whether or not
their coaches actually believe in
what they so repeatedly profess.

Well I’m

Julian Krug is different from
mostcoaches in that he practices
what he preaches to his atheletes.

Recently Krug, 40, won his age
group and the Grand Masters
division at the prestigious Indoor
Masters National Diving Tourna-
ment. He set two new tourna-
ment records as well.

This is Krug’s first return to
professional diving since 1979
when he was third in the World
Trick and Acrobatic Diving
Championships — he was first the

Krug has been busy coaching
Pitt's diving teams since that time
and has not competed profession-
ally because it has not been com-
patible with that schedule.

He decided to compete this
year, though, since the competi-

Buffalo, N.Y,). and did not inter—.

ly, was not expecting to do well
in his first outing in over 8 years.

He certainly did not expect to v

win.
‘Krug competed simply forlthe
joy of competing. He came away

from the competition with much
more than a gold medal.

”Probably the most valuable
thing I gained from this ex-
perience is a deepened appreci-
ation of what my divers go
through,” said Krug. ”I can sit
there and coach all I want, and
it is particuarly frustrating for me
to see them get frustrated when
they are unable to change a fault
in a particular dive they are hav-
ing trouble with.

”I realized when I went out
there again that I got frustrated by

. the same things they did,” con-

tinued Krug. ”I_ also rediscovered
how hard it can. be to work the
kinks out of a dive and change
your habits. Perhaps I will have
more patience with the kids I
coach in the future.”

Krug, winner of the Big East
Most Outstanding Coach award

last year, has impressive diving.

credentials.

The list includes having I,

coached the United States team
in the Goodwill Games that were
held in Moscow, being the senior
vice president of United States
Diving, serving as a judge at the
1984 U.S. Olympic diving trials
and being the chairman of the
Judges Certification Committee
for Senior Nationals, as well as

being a three—time member of the -

U.S. national diving coaching
staff.

Krug, originally from State Col-

0 lege, Pa., has been involved in

diving since the age of 10 and
was a three—time All-American at
the University of Wisconsin.

Krug’s proudest moment in div-
ing was when he became the first
person in the world to complete
a forward 5‘/2 somersault from a
10-"meter platform using a mini-
trampoline. To date, only three

I ' people have been able to com-

plete the dive. -

Krug explained that he can get
right back into the swing of things
in diving after years of absence

_from competition "because he
never forgets what he has '

learned.

’’I feel once you learn some-
thing you never forget it,” said
Krug. ”If I stay reasonably in
shape, it will be possible for me
to compete. I'm really excited
that I was able to dive the same
list.I used to in college. I feel I

_ have learned a lot about diving

since that time and, as a result,
my diving mechanics are better
now.”

Although the Masters Tourna-
ment’s age groups included peo-
ple up to the-ageof 84, Krug does
not think he will be around to
participate at_ that age.

”I would be delighted to even
reach the age of 84, much less be
in physical shape to dive,” said
Krug. '

For the timebeing, Krug will
continue to compete profession-
ally when convenient and will
look forward to another season of
Ironhand rule by Pitt in Eastern
