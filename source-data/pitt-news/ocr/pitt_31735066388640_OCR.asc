Lobbyists pressure Congress

By Jim Drinkard

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON —— An impen-
ding congressional showdown
over the Reagan administration's
policy of aid to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels has triggered a
round of intense lobbying aimed
at about five dozen ”swing” law-
makers.

But many of those who are in
the center of the storm of persua-
sion say they are relatively un-
affected by it, and are watching
developments in Central Ameri-
ca before they make last—minute
voting decisions.

President Reagan is expected to
renew his plea for aid to the re-
bels in Monday night's State of
the Union speech, then follow it
with a formal request to Congress
on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Under an earlier agreement

with Congress, consideration of
the aid issue will be on a fast
track. The vote in the House,
which is expected to be the major
battleground, is scheduled for
Feb. 3. Should the House ap-
prove the request, it would then
go to the Senate for a vote the
next day.

Reagan, who has mounted a
vigorous public campaign for a
Contra aid package in recent
days, will continue that effort
over the next week or so. He will
discuss the matter Wednesday, in
what the White House has billed
as a major address to the Reserve
Officers Association.

The president also will make a
pitch on Friday to a group of civ-
ic leaders, and may make a na-
tionally televised address on the
eve of the House vote.

With the exception of those
speeches and the formal submis-

sion of an arms—control treaty to
the Senate later in the week, Rea-
gan has cleared his calendar to
lobby members of Congress by
telephone and in White House
meetings.

Asked Sunday what he thought
the chances for the aid vote were,
Republican Senate whip Allan
Simpson of Wyoming said,
”We’re going to have to hear the
intensity of the president in the
State of the Union address. How
bad does he really want it?”
Simpson was interviewed on
NBC-TV’s Meet the Press.

Supporting the Contras, whom
Reagan refers to as ”freedom
fighters," has become the ad-
ministration's highest foreign-
policy priority. Reagan contends
that progress toward peace and
democratization in Nicaragua are
a direct result of military pressure
applied by the rebels.

Prof speaks out against Reagan

By Michael Elko
For The Pitt News

A University of Pittsburgh law
professor and an Academy
Award winning director ex-
pressed their dismay over the
Reagan administration’s plan to
push ahead for more U.S. aid to
the Contra’s despite the progress
they feel that has been made by
the Nicaraguan government
toward ending the civil war.

Professorlules Lobel, who has
acted as a consultant to the
Nicaraguan National Assembly in
drawing up their constitution,

feels that the Reagan administra-
tion’s actions are ”outrageous” in
light of the recent concessions
made by the Sandinistas.

”I think it's outrageous  that
given all of the compromises that
the Sandinistas have made, given
their suspending of the national
state of emergency, given their
agreement to talk directly with
the Contras, that the Reagan ad-
ministration can still even talk
about pushing for more aid,”
Lobel said.

Lobel feels the press can often
be one-sided when it comes to
some issues concerning

Nicaragua.

’’I think they [the press] portray
Nicaragua as a totalitarian state
and that the only question is how
to fix it up,” said Lobel.

Deborah Shaffer, director of the
film Fire from the Mountain,
which premiered this past
weekend in the Pittsburgh Peace
and Justice Film Festival, agreed
with Lobe|’s views.

”Our purpose in making [the
film] was first ‘of all to kind of give
a human face to the people of
Nicaragua that I think they don't
have, for the most part, in the me-
dia here,” Shaffer said.

Reagan to deliver
usual Union address

By Robert M. Andrews

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — Presi-
dent Reagan’s favorite recipe
for a State of the Union
address:

I. Stir an oratorical stew of
optimism, patriotism and
nostalgia laced with
hyperbole.

2. Sprinkle with Ieg.islative
proposals, mostly leftovers.

3. Add a dash of spicy re-
bukes for big—spending
Democrats, a dollop of praise
for the Nicaraguan Contras
and a pinch of scorn for Soviet
militarists.

4. Top off with tributes to an
American hero or two sitting
in the balcony with Nancy
Reagan.

5. Heat to bubbling. Serve
before a joint session of Con-
gress and a nationwide televi-
sion audience.

If his six previous speeches
are any guide, look for Reagan
to stick to his standard formu-
la for a boffo performance
when he delivers his seventh
State of the Union address
Monday night. Once again, in
the tradition of presidents past,
it's likely to be long on rhetor-
ic and short on substance.

But watch to see if Reagan
sweetens the pot with a
surprise.

The old Hollywood actor

hinted as much last week
when he told a rally of senior
administration officials, ”As
they say in show biz, let's
bring them to their feet with
our closing act."

There's an unmistakable
Hollywood aroma, in fact, to
much of Reagan's past State of
the Union oratory.

His early succession of
speeches, focusing on restor-
ing the country to economic
health, contained robust im-
agery evocative of the late cel-
luloid cowpoke John Wayne.
In 1983, he declared that
”America is on the mend.” In,
1984, ”America is back, stand-
ingtal|.” In 1986, ”America is
on the move.”

While other presidents have
quoted the likes of Tom Paine,
Ben Franklin or Alexis de Toc-
queville, Reagan summed up
his vision of America in 1986
with a line from Steven Spiel-
berg's popular movie, Back to
the Future. In the same
speech, he applauded families
and communities as ”the co-
stars of this great American
comeback.”

Reagan has seen few of his
major State of the Union initia-
tives gain the approval of a
contentious Congress, which
came under the total control of
the Democrats in 1986.

Cincinnati stops water intake as spill nears

CINCINNATI —— The million-
gallon oil spill floating down the
Ohio River from the Pittsburgh
area has reached Cincinnati, and
intake valves that draw water
from the river for some 850,000
people have been closed.

The intake valves were closed
Saturday night about four hours
before the diesel fuel, dispersed
and highly diluted since it first en-
tered an Ohio River tributary near
Pittsburgh, arrived in the Cincin-
nati area, according to officials of
the Cincinnati Water Works.

Water reserves were sufficient
to allow customers in the city and
surrounding Hamilton, Butler
and Warren counties to use water
for four to five days with no need
to conserve water, said Dennis
Davis, administrative supervisor
for the water works.

The oil slick, which is about 50
miles long, was moving down the
river at about 3 mph and was ex-
pected to pass Cincinnati in
about two days, Davis said.

The spill was caused when an
Ashland Oil Co. tank collapsed
on Jan. 2 and 1 million gallons of

diesel fuel poured into the
Monongahela River.

Officials say the spill has begun
to dilute to less harmful levels as
a result of rain in the Ohio Valley.

”We are finally getting the di-

m

lution that we had hoped for all
along,” said Peter A. Tennant of
the Ohio River Valley Water As-
sociation.

The oil had diluted from about
150 milligrams per liter of water
at the spill site to about 1 milli-
gram per liter at Cincinnati, Da-
vis said. The fuel has also
dispersed throughout the river
water instead of just floating on
top, he said.

Waste dump tops on
Harrisburg agendas

HARRISBURG ,— Establishing
the process for siting a low-level
radioactive waste dump in Penn-

House and Senate this week,
aides and lawmakers say.

The controversial legislation,
which has been the focus of

much debate in recent months, is
an initial step toward construct-
ing a site to dispose of radioac-
tive resins, clothes and other
waste from a four—state region.

Officials feel a consensus may
be building as a series of dead-
lines pressure the state to act.
Senate Majority Whip F. Joseph
Loeper, R—Delaware, said discus-
sions were ongoing with House
leaders in an attempt to reach
agreeable language in the bill.

However, a list of divisive
amendments were expected to
ensure verbal jousting in both
chambers.

”Once it gets out on the floor
there will be a lot of debate,”
predicted Tony Barbush, an aide
to House Majority Leader James
Manderino, D-Westmoreland.

”The concern is the same.
Everyone is saying, ‘Not in my
back yard.’ It's very parochial,”
Barbush said.

The bill does not select a
specific site, but sets up the
process by which the state will go
about choosing-and regulating it,
inc|uding‘hiring a contractor to
build and operate the facility.

Two men die when
plane loses power

WAYNESBURG, Pa. (AP) —
Two men died Sunday afternoon
when their single-engine airplane
lost power shortly after takeoff
and crashed while attempting to
return to the Greene County
Airport.

The victims, who were
pronounced dead at the scene,
were not immediately identified.
State police at the Waynesburg
detachment were not certain
when their identities would be
known.

Troopers said the Cessna 182
took off about 1:40 p.m. and ap-
parently lost power moments af-
ter takeoff. The pilot was
attempting to turn back toward
the runway when the plane
crashed in a field adjacent to the
airport, which is located in Frank-
lin Township near Waynesburg.

Pitt rowing club knows what it means to be tough

By Erik Kridle

For the Pitt News

Try to imagine yourself and a
few friends going down to the
riverside a little after dawn. You
shove off in a small boat and
move slowly to the center of the
dark blue waters of the Alleghe-
ny. You breath deeply, realizing
a new love for the air.

Everyone begins to row, spo-
radically at first, but with a grow-

stream of flowing colors as you
and your companions move a-
cross the water’s surface in per—
fect motion.

Are you able to see yourself out
there? Could this be for you?
Well, don’t answer quite yet be-

Women smokers given help

By Theresa Costello
Staff Writer

Public areas where smokers are
allowed to light up have been re-
stricted by legislation and social
pressure. Smoking, once the
sophisticated and mature thing to
do, is quickly becoming stigma-
tized. But a joint program be-
tween the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine
and Magee-Women's Hospital is
there to help the smokers. Help
them quit, that is.

Healthsource, located at 3347
Forbes Ave., has a program to

' help women ”kick the habit.”

Sponsored by the National In-
stitute on Drug Abuse, the pro-
gram is free to women who meet
special qualifications.

”The women must be between
the ages of 18 to 45, in good
health status and smoke more
than 10 cigarettes a day,” ex-
plained Dr. Peggy Russell, pro-
gram director and professor of
pyschiatry at Pitt. Women who
do not fit these qualifications may
still join, but for them, there is a
fee.

To join the program, women
must first call Healthsource at
647-4400 for a brief phone inter-

view. After a personal interview,
participants will begin a two-
month period of recording daily
when and how many cigarettes
they smoked, and other daily ac-
tivities.

”One of the main points of this
program is to control weight gain
after they quit smoking, which is
one of a smoker’s greatest reasons
not toquit,” said Russell. These
records will indicate if the wom-
en change other habits during the
program, especially eating.

Along with help in fitness and
weight control, Healthsource also
counsels stress management,
offering participants other ways
to combat stressful situations and
avoid the need for a cigarette.

, After the first two months, the
participants are asked to quit.
Russell said, ”For the first week,
the women meet every day be-
cause it is a time when they need
extra support.”

Checkups are done at three, six
and 12 months to determine
progress and discuss
problems.

Healthsource is designed to fit
women's needs. ”We’ve found
that women do better having the
support of other females that have

any V

similar problems,” said Russell.
According to the American

Cancer Society, the numbers of

smokers have decreased across
all ages and sexes, but females,
especially those between the ages
of 1 7 to 30, constitute a large per-
centage of those still smoking.
Twenty—one percent of females
were found to smoke in high

school as compared with 18 per-

cent males. But the difference is
greater in college; 18 percent fe-
males and 10 percent males.

Russell believes that ”the big-
gest problem is that many college
students think they are going to
smoke for a few years and then
quit. It becomes harder for smok-
ers to stop as they continue to
smoke.”

Another serious issue is wom-
en who smoke and are pregnant.

”We are in a rather precarious
position with the atheletic depart-
ment,” said Coach Follet. ”They
have told us that they do not want
a varsity rowing team.”

The club did make a request to
become a varsity sport, ”not for
the financial benefits,” according
to Follet, but to enable them to
have more access to university
athletic facilities such as weight

Follet said the university does not
want them to be competitive;
however, the team is permitted to
take part in exhibitions.

Follet emphasized that ”rowing
is one of the better all-around
body conditioning sports.” In ad-
dition, she feels that the mental
challenges aren't as great in other
sports.

Rich Zahrobsky, men's captain,
likes rowing because for him, it
is ”totally different” from other
sports in which he has partic-
ipated.

World AIDS Conference to start on

LONDON — Health officials
from 145 countries are gathering
in London this week for a world
AIDS summit at which they will
plan a global assault on the dead-

I ly epidemic.

The three—day conference,
which opens Tuesday, will be the
largest meeting of government
ministers ever held on a single
health problem, according to the
World Health Organization.

The U.N. agency, based in
Geneva, and the British govern-
ment are co-sponsoring the
event

”The conference, we believe,
is going to mark another critical
turning point in the global mobili-
zation against AIDS,” Dr. Jona-
than Mann, the American
director of WHO’s Special Pro-

. gram on AIDS, said in an inter-

view with The Associated Press.
Health ministers from 131
countries and government ad-
visers from 14 others have
registered for the World Summit
of Ministers of Health on Pro-
grams for AIDS Prevention.
Princess Anne, the daughter of
Queen Elizabeth II, will deliver

the opening speech.

Attending from the United
States will be Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop; Dr. Robert E. Win-
dom, the No. 2 official at the
Department of Health and Hu-
man Services; Dr. Gary Noble,
deputy director of the Atlanta-
based Centers for Disease Con-

trol in charge of AIDS activity;
and Dr. Peter]. Fischinger, AIDS
Coordinator for the Public Health
Service.

Unlike conferences involving
medical experts working on vac-
cines and treatments for AIDS,
this summit deals mainly with
government efforts to control the
spread of Acquired Immune Defi-
ciency Syndrome.

60 killed when train

derails in south China

BEIJING —— An express train
derailed early Sunday in the
mountains of southern China and

90 people were killed and 66
others seriously injured, the offi-
cial Xinhua News Agency
reported. .

It was China's sixth major trans-
portation accident in a month. A
total of 314 people have been
killed. I

The No. 80 Kunming-Shanghai
express derailed and overturned
at 1:35 a.m. as it traveled be-
tween Qiewu and Dengjiacun
stations, 220 miles from Kunm-
ing, capital of Yunnan province,
Xinhua quoted the Ministry of
Railways as saying.

The cause of the derailment
was not known, Xinhua said.

The report did not say how
many cars derailed, how many
passengers were on the train or
in which direction the train was
going. It was not immediately
known whether any foreigners
were among the dead or injured.

Acting Premier Li Peng ordered
army and police to the scene to
maintain order. Army units and
local medicalworkers took the
injured to hospitals.

The accident took place in
Yunnan close to its border with

authorities said.

Officer John Chase, 25, who
last month switched from an
evening to a day shift to spend
more time with his bride of three
months, was attacked Saturday as
he was writing a traffic ticket.

Thesuspect, Carl Dudley Wil-
liams, 34, was shot by off-duty
officers who responded to the

call. The man died a few hours‘

later at Parkland Memorial Hospi-
tal, police said.

A crowd of about 30 people
gathered around the officer and
his assailant, a homeless man
with a history of mental illness,
according to police and wit-
nesses.

”The officer was saying, ’Don’t
shoot me. I'll help you whatever
way I Can.’ But the guy shot him
in the head,’ ” witness Melitha
Johnson said.

”One girl said that people in
the crowd were saying, ‘Shoot
him, shoot him again,’ ” said
police Lt. Jerald Calane.

Investigators said they knew of
no motive for the shooting.

Woman disappointed with fiance's performance

Q:My fiance was the first man
I ever had an orgasm with, and
this seemed like a great promise
for the future. I was so happy, I
was walking on air. However,
subsequent orgasms have not
been equal to the first two or
three, and! have to wonder if this
is a common experience for
women.

A: I am so glad you didn't ask
”ls this a normal experience?”
Because although we sex ther-
apists are trained to answer ques-
tions seriously no matter how
often they have been asked, still

I we are only human, and it seems

like a big break when someone
doesn't ask the same question in

the same form. Many women
have the experience you
describe, of having a strong or-
gasm initially and then wonder-
ing why the orgasms after that are
less overwhelming.

But many other women have
minor orgasms or no orgasms in
their early sexual encounters,
then have better ones, and then
magnificent ones. Either way, the
experience can be described as
widespread, as familiar, as well-
known, but should not be called
normal because that gives wom-
en a fixed idea of what should
happen, and they will be worried
if what they expect does not
happen.

The fact is that there are ups
and downs in women's sexual
experiences, and also in men's.
And the orgasmic women — the
woman who has had orgasms
and can expect to go on having
orgasms —— will have terrific or-
gasms sometimes and lesser ones
other times and sometimes will
be rather disappointed. This var-
iety of intensity parallels other ex-
periences in life and should not
cause any woman any alarm.

You are lucky to have had
some terrific orgasms, and if you
don't alarm yourself, you will cer-
tainly have many, many more.
Meanwhile, enjoy the intimacy,
enjoy giving pleasure to your

partner, and take pleasure in
whatever orgasms you get, know-
ing that there will be many great
ones in your future.

One can only theorize about
why some orgasms are great and
others less great. Was it the holi-
day or honeymoon atmosphere
that helped make it great? Was it
because somebody had just been
promoted or earned a raise in sa-
lary? Because somebody had pro-
posed marriage or agreed to
marry? Because the mortgage was
finally paid off? Because the man
at last initiated sex in a wonder-
fully confident way, putting all
the woman's doubts out of her
mind? Because he had aroused

her with some new foreplay ac-
tivity? Because the couple sud-
denly gave in to a mutual impulse
to have sex on a heap of laundry
in the basement? We can only
guess at the reason, but one thing
is certain — the next orgasm
won't be just like it.

You have to accept that your
sex life will have its moods, its
highs and lows. Sometimes, a cli-
max will seem to justify that
description of Hemingway's, that
the Earth moved. Other times, it
will only be a feeble, fluttering
sensation. Or you will know you
have climaxed only by the relax-
ation, the sense of release from
sexual tension.

CoNDKoI\l

Lisa and Trish were sitting in a
booth at an out-of-the—way diner
on Penn Avenue. It was raining
and cold outside, and the mood
inside pretty much matched the
weather.

I was sitting in a booth with my
back to them, and though I
couldn't see them, I could hear
their conversation quite clearly.
I didn't say a word to them; I was
just indulging one of my favorite
pastimes — eavesdropping.

At first, they were fascinating.
Semi—literate Mon Valley chicks
in tight jeans and their late teens
always are. However, as their sto-
ry unfolded, my fascination in-
creased exponentially.

Trish and Lisa were obviously
old friends. They were exchang-
ing pleasantries and keeping their
conversation light, or at least
were trying to.

Trish started crying, and Lisa
was comforting her. Trish had a
3-year-old son. Her father had
custody of him and she was only
allowed to have him for a few
hours a week. She had had him
for the afternoon that day. She
told Lisa that since she really
didn't have much money, she
and her son just walked around
downtown in the rain. Trish said
that she liked rain because she
could walk around and cry, and
nobody would notice.

When Trish returned her son to
her father after their walk, her
father was furious because the kid
was sopping wet, and threatened
to call whatever government
office it is that rules over custody
battles.

The fact that she didn't have
custody of her kid really made
me wonder what she could have
done to be called ”unfit” by the
courts.

Well, as it turns out, Trish and
Lisa are strippers/prostitutes.

I guess to make Trish feel bet-
ter about her sorry lot, Lisa told

THE NAKED CITY
PAUI. ANATER

her about what she had been
through the night before.

”I had a job in McKeesport last
night,” she_started. Some guy's
girlfriend had died recently, and
some of his friends pitched in and
secured Trish’s services.

After she and the guy were
done transacting business, for
lack of a better word, she got

dressed and walked out of the

bedroom.

The dead girl's sister was lying
in wait for her. The dead girl's sis-
ter pounced, and a cat fight en-
sued. A roomful of men watched
and cheered as Lisa emerged vic-
torious.

Then no one would drive her
home, and she had to get a cab
back to her apartment in East
Liberty. She got home at 10 a.m.,
and had to be at work at 11.

She works, as does Trish, at
one of the peek-a—boo places on
Liberty Avenue.

Trish must have felt better after
hearing Lisa's story because she
stopped crying.

Theirlconversation turned to
how much they hate what they
do for a living, how disgusting
their customers are, and how
dirty they felt. They talked about
how hopeless everything seemed
and were grateful to have each
other to talk to. They both agreed
that the only way out of ”the life”
was to get married to someone
who would take them away from
Liberty Avenue.

Then they finished their coffee,
paid their check and walked in
front of me, and I saw them clear-
ly for the first time. Trish was
pregnant.

They walked out onto Penn
Avenue and back into the rain. I
shook my head and remembered
that they were no older than 20.

I finished my coffee, paid the
disfigured cashier, and walked
home.

*****

Here's a nifty little poem that
was written by Lutz Reiprich. He
submitted it some time ago, but
here it is, better late than never.

Introduction: The following is a
little piece I've written concern-
ing that special awareness that is
so unique to each of us on the
fringe of consciousness.

THE NIGHT COMES SOFTLY

Sometimes. when the night is
dark

and you lie alone in bed,

the solutions come so quickly.
So quickly that you don't even
have time

which one is the best one or
which alternative suits the situa-
tion the

best.

Why is it that the night brings out
the counselor in us, the
philosopher,

the sage, the druid  the wizard?

As your thoughts leave the con-
fines of

your body, they sail like tea-
clippers

on the China Sea,

 across your covers.

You will have barely noticed ever
thinking

them, and will already be well on
their

voyage.

A Hawking miseryfor fun and profit

They will make the drop across
the edge of

your bed with an ease only
known to elves

on their nocturnal journeys.
What was that I heard?

Did I hear them touch the floor?
Were they swallowed up in the
dense

softness, like a colored bird sub-
merging .

into the tree canopy of the rain
forest.

They dance across your room.
Children on an excursion.

You will never catch them.
They will return to you only tem-
porarily, A

rendering some thought process
lost already

for a million years in the world of
semi-conscious landscapes.
They will pass you one last time
on their

neverending flight across this
land

we hold so dear.

My friend Richard is sitting
across the room as I write this.
He's minding his own business,
and working hard.

He is a very snappy dresser,
and he has a penchant for brief
flashes of sartorial color.

Something’s amiss tonight,
though. No flash, no verve. Just
a blue sweatshirt and black jeans.

He is wearing bowling shoes,
however. Their green and red
splendor is marred by scuffs and
streaks, the true sign of a dedicat-
ed bowler. Yep, it’s Christmas
year ’round when good old
Richard is around. Even though
chances are good he stole the
bowling shoes, it's still Christmas.

Have a

Gary Hart's shield against scandal

 

ELLEN
GOODMAN

He wouldn't be where he is to-
day without her. Not in New
Hampshire. Not in Iowa. Not in
the running at all.

I don't say this as a political
nicety, the words that any candi-
date would employ as he tipped
his hat to his loyal wife. In the
case of Gary Hart, it is the abso-
lute truth.

Maybe this time he can do
without the media consultants
and campaign strategists and
pollsters. But there is no way he
can be without Lee.

So she can be seen these win-
try days, standing by her man, in
photographs and newsfilm, in the
coffee shops and drug stores and
high school auditoriums. They
are inseperable. He even in-
troduces her to the toll—taker at a

Three years ago, a close friend
of mine gave me a leather—bound
diary and a gold-plated pen as a
high school graduation present.
Two and half years ago, I stopped
writing in my diary, and I lost the
pen; my friend and I lost touch.

Three days ago, I began a new
journal.

The journal is only an empty,
$1.49 Pitt notebook, and I write
with a chewed-up, Bic pen.
However, the writing is just as

In a nutshell 

turnpike booth.

Lee Hart has become her hus-
band's talisman. She is a portable
shield about The Question. A liv-
ing rebuttal for those who would
attack him for wife misuse.

Who would be so rude as to
badger him with questions about
Donna in front of Lee? If some-
one in an audience or on late-
night television criticizes his be-
havior as a husband, Hart has his
defense close by. ”She is active-
ly campaigning for me,” he can
say and has said, ”... so I don't
think this caller has the right to in-
terpose himself in my wife's
defense.” If his wife doesn't feel
abused, surely we shouldn't feel
it for her.

Today Lee Hart holds the key
to his comeback. And more than
that. She holds the key to her
own comeback as well.

Last May, when photographs of
Gary and Donna Rice seemed to
be a permanent fixture in the
papers, when everyone in Ameri-
ca was speculating on the impact
of ”womanizing” in politics, the
candidate's wife looked as if she

was held together by chewing

gum. She was the national image
of a wronged wife.

Their marriage became public
property. Many made bets on
how much longer they would
last. Three months? A year? Peo-
ple who had never met Lee Hart

a record

important to me.

I started my new journal some-
time after midnight. It was one of
those nights when nothing was
on TV; I was tired of homework,
and everyone was out drinking.
I wasn't depressed; I wasn't hap-
py; I didn't feel like talking on the
telephone, and I didn't want to
exercise. I found an empty note-
book when I was digging through
my cabinet for a cigarette.

I'm still not sure why I started
writing in the notebook. It was
the only thing I felt like doing at
the time.

I didnlt care about grammar,
punctuation or neatness. My
sentences were run-ons and frag-
ments; my words were mis-
spelled. The only thing I cared
about was that I could read what
I was writing about.

I felt very comfortable with my
pen and notebook. There was no
pressure to entertain a reader or
research an issue, and I could
write about anything that popped
into my head.

I wrote about my classes, my
lack of academic discipline, my

asked each other why Gary just
didn't get divorced. People who
knew nothing of their relation-
ship asked each other why Lee
didn't just ditch the guy.

When Lee Hart looks back on
those days in May, she says, ”It
was hell,” and nobody doubts it.
But she chose to join her husband
in portraying that hell as a media
creation;

After 28 years of marriage and
two seperations, she said: ”I
know Gary better than anyone
else, and when Gary says noth-
ing happened, nothing hap-
pened.” She was not a wronged
woman. They were a wronged
family.

When, in turn, Hart wanted to
re—enter the race, the decision
hinged on Lee. As he put it cooly,
”It got down to how much abuse
she was willing to take.” Not
from him, mind you, from the
press.

Why did she do it? Why does
she do it? Why does she shake
hands every day with people
who are uncomfortable in her
presence, people who shared her
humiliation, who see mental im-
ages of Donna Rice on her hus-
band's lap when she comes into
a New Hampshire hall? What
makes Lee Hart run?

_ I don't think it is masochism or
unblinking ambition for the
White House. If Gary Hart be-

lieves that he can overcome the
image of philanderer and retrieve
his dignity, I suspect Lee Hart be-
lieves she can save her self-
respect and her marriage. She can
campaign as a partner, not a
victim.

Her public image may have
been as hard to live with as his.
After all, we once applauded
spouses for stoicism, for keeping
a marriage together no matter
what. Now we are as likely to
wonder why someone ”takes it.”
Divorce was once a political kiss
of death and indiscretions over-
looked. Now we condemn infi-
delity and accept divorce.

Clearly this is not a Golden Era
for wronged wives. We are less
admiring of long suffering. We
tend to believe that suffering and
sufferers are foolish. She is,
rather, the unflagging campaign-
er. the crucial member of the
Hart team.

I don't know whether the
voters will buy a new Hart
brigade or a resurrected marriage.

But for now, the candidate, a true’
I loner, defiantly se|f—reliant and at

times blindly self-centered, has
taken on a real partner. This Gary
Hart needs his wife. It must be,

after all this, a good feeling for

Lee.

of our successes

obnoxious roommates, my par-
ents, friends, a girl I once dated,
my fears and the future.

Some of the things that came
out on paper were unfamiliar to
me. As I reread sentences, other
thoughts and memories entered
my’ mind. I realized I was angry
at certain people and unsure of
how good a person I was.

For two hours, I stayed at my
desk and wrote without looking
up from the notebook. As I wrote,
I was able to remember moments
and how they made me feel.

There d idn’t seem enough time
to record everything I wanted to
say. No matter how many pages
I filled, there were always more
thoughts, events and people I
wanted to write about. My hand
began to ache; my pen was go-
ing dry, and I started thinking
about my neglected homework.
I ended my journal entry with the
promise that I would continue to
write on a steady basis.

Yesterday, I looked through my
old leather diary to find some rea-
son as to why I stopped writing
two years ago.

In the last entry of my old di-
ary, I wrote that I was working
hard in my new college classes;
I loved the independence; the
people were friendly, and there
was a party that weekend.

As a freshman, everything
seemed clear. I just had to do
well in my classes, make dean's
list, go to football games and
have fun. At that time in my life,
I didn't need a journal.

Presently, nothing is clear —
the future, people or myself.

It's easy not to question the
changes we go through. It can be
depressing to realize we are not
children anymore and are re-
quired to be responsible. We dis-
cuss problems and aspirations
with our friends and family, but
how many times do we discuss
who we are?

The things we shut out from
ourselves affect us throughout our
lives, shaping who we are. The
thoughts we close off can never
be discussed because they are not
expressed. Therefore, sometimes
we change without knowing
why.

Friends see what you want
them to see, sometimes more and
sometimes less. The most impor-
tant question is what we see in
ourselves.

Writing in a journal three days
ago helped me understand a lit-
tle more about who I am. It was
the ultimate friend of whom I
could never lose touch and who
listened to everything I said, no
matter how trivial.

Too many times we take for
granted our ability to respond to
people and situations. Though
we will die someday, a journal
will preserve who we are. Every-
one can make money, but no one
writes in the same way.

We are constantly thinking and
feeling. To record every emotion
is impossible. However, not to
recognize our complexity would
be a waste. Even when we may
not think we feel something, our
writing may tell us differently.

ROTC——— Foundation hopes to revive the dead

Continued from page 1

Sailer was chosen for the me-
dal based on her academic
record, the results of her Air Force
qualifying tests and her perfor-
mance in field training.

Sailer has been a cadet with Air
Force ROTC since 1986, having
participated in an accelerated
two-year program.

According to Sailer, 21, from

RIVERSIDE, Calif. — When a
cryonics company froze Dora
Kent’s head last month, it was
with the hope that the 83-year-
old woman could someday be re-
vived and live in a new body
without the disease that plagued
her first life.

But while the members of the
Alcor Life Extension Foundation
cast themselves as visionaries,
others consider cryonics the work
of mad scientists.

Cryonics is the freezing of the
dead in hopes that technology

will someday advance to the
point that the bodies can be re-
vived, a practice scoffed at by
most medical authorities.

On Jan. 7, Alcor President
Michael Darwin and five mem-
bers were handcuffed and taken
in for questioning, and the River-
side County coroner demanded
to examine Mrs. Kent’s severed
head.

The physician and Alcor mem-
ber who signed Kent’s death cer-
tificate, indicating she died from
pneumonia, is under review by

‘the University of California, Los

Angeles School of Medicine,
where he is a post-graduate
research pathologist. The man
who removed the woman's head,
a research associate at the medi-
cal school, has been put on a
paid leave of absence.

Alcor has refused to turn over
Mrs. Kent’s head, and earlier this

month received a temporary
court order preventing the
coroner from disturbing the
frozen remains. A Feb. 1 hearing
is set.

Alcor officials say it is the
novelty of the field that got them
into trouble.

”The law is really behind the
times in dealing with it,” Alcor at-
torney Christopher Leanders said.

Coroner Ray Carrillo has found
that few if any regulations exist to
police cryonics firms.

”It’s a big, new, unregulated
field,” said John Gill, executive
officer of the state Cemetery
Board, which licenses cemeteries
and crematories.

Gill would like to see cryonics
firms outlawed, but he added,
”Nothing is going to happen from
a legislative and regulatory point
of view until you have more
proven abuses.”

There have been abuses. In
1980, authorities, acting on the
concerns of relatives, opened a
tomb in Chatsworth, where four
people were said to be frozen. In-
stead, they found rotting remains.

’’I’m almost certain that we're
going to have to do some tight-
ening up of the Iaw,” said state
Sen. Robert Presley.

The Riverside County coroner's
investigation was sparked be-

cause Kent’s death certificate in- =

dicated she died at a residence,
later determined to be Alcor’s
laboratory, without a doctor
present.

An autopsy on her headless
body was unable to determine
the cause of death.

An estimated 14 heads or com-
plete bodies are known to be
frozen by U.S cryonics firms: two
bodies are kept by the Cryonics
Institute in Oak Park, Mich.; three
heads and two bodies at Trans-
Time lnc., in Oakland, Calif.; and
one body and six heads at Alcor,
which also has a cat and two
dogs.

Alcor is the second-largest
cryonics group in the nation, with
about 250 members, 98 of whom
want to be frozen, Darwin said.

TransTime claims to be the lar-

At Alcor, clients pay $100,000

also $200. annual dues.

Gttfried turns down Packers, stays at Pitt 

 

Pitt football coach Mike Gott-
fried, rumored as a candidate for
the head coaching job of the
Green Bay Packers, has an-
nounced he has no interest in
leaving the Panthers.

”I’ve informed the Green Bay
Packers today [Sunday] that I am
definitely not interested in the po-
sition.

’’I appreciate their interest in
me, and I'm very flattered, but my
goal is to remain at Pitt,” said

Panthers to recover

By john Enright
Editor in Chief

NORMAN, Okla. — The Pitt
Panthers have run out of time to
ponder Saturday's 86-83 loss to
the Oklahoma Sooners — and
that's what worries Pitt coach
Paul Evans.

Tonight, the Providence Friars
visit Fitzgerald Field House for a
7:30 game.

Providence lost to Boston Col-
lege 64-48 in Boston Saturday.
The Friars are 8-7 overall and 2-3
in the Big East.

Pitt [ranked sixth by the As-
sociated Press] is 13-2 overall and
3-1 in the league.

The Friars have never won at
Pitt, but they've come close, los-
ing twice by a single point and by
four points in a double-overtime
game.

Evans is more concerned about
his team's mental toughness than
Providence’s full-court pressure
defense.

’’I thought Oklahoma was
good preparation for Providence,
and I hope it is. It's just that the
kids seem a little bit more down
than I thought they might have
been. It's just a mental thing to
get back,” Evans said.

Pitt lost to Oklahoma 96-93 in
the second round of the NCAA
Western Regional last year. ”This
game was very similar. It almost
feels like deja vu. We lose by
three points, and it hurts to lose
again by three points to Oklaho-
ma,” Pitt forward Demetreus
Gore said.

”The players felt if they had a
couple breaks, they could have
pulled it off,” added Evans.

There’s no doubt that Pitt had
its chances, but turnovers (Pitt
had 24 to Oklahoma's nine), a
lack of outside shooting (Panther
point guard Sean Miller was one-
of-eight from three-point range)

 while

Craig Heyward, Pitt's All-
America running back, has been
rumored to want to skip his final
season of eligibility and turn pro
according to a story in Saturday's
edition of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

The story said Heyward has not
attended a class this term.

This weekend, Heyward flew
to Washington D.C. to meet with
sports agent Bruce Allen. If he

and a few bad spurts cost them.

”We didn't want to get in a
wild game, and we did for a few
minutes,” Gore said. ”We had a
spurt where we threw the ball
around a little bit and didn’t han-
dle it very well, and that cost us
the game.”

Harvey Grant didn’t help mat-
ters for Pitt either. The 6-foot—8
Oklahoma senior forward was
nearly unstoppable, scoring a

game-high 28 points on 12-for-19 ~

shooting.

Said Evans: ”We just couldn't
stop Grant. We tried three differ-
ent people on him. We tried
fronting him. We tried playing
behind him. We tried everything.
Every time they needed a buck-
et, they got it by going his way.”

A jumper by Gore gave Pitt a
20-17 lead with 13:37 left in the
half, but Oklahoma's full-court
pressure started to wear on the
Panthers.

Jerome Lane and Charles Smith
were called for traveling, and
Gore lost the ball out of bounds
while trying to break the press.
The Sooners went on an 18-2 run
led by nine points from Grant,
giving Oklahoma a 35-22 ad-
vantage.

Oklahoma
49-40.

The Panthers started the second
half the same way they ended the
first — in a bit of trouble. A 12-4
run in the first four minutes gave
Oklahoma its biggest lead of the
game, 61-44.

Pitt was able to battle back, led
by freshman center Bobby Mar-
tin and Lane. The Panthers went
on a 17-4 run to cut the Sooners
lead to 65-61 with 10:55 left.

Miller hit a 3-pointer, Martin
scored seven straight points, Lane
scored five straight and Smith
finished off the spurt with a layup
off a missed shot.

But Pitt couldn't tie the score.

Gregg wanted to return to

Gottfried’s reasons for staying

”My family loves the city of

set with the negative publicity
surrounding the arrest. According
to the Post Gazette, Heyward
told a teammate that he desired
to turn pro after the arrest.

Heyward was the nation's se-
cond leading rusher last season
with 1,655 yards. He finished a
distant fifth in the Heisman

a front—runner for next year's

Heyward must get 24 credits
before the start of next season, or
he will be declared academical-
ly ineligible by the university.

Many pro scouts feel that Hey-
ward would be a high first round
pick in April's NFL draft if he is
eligible.

Heyward is the father of a

stated at CBS’ live broadcast of

night in a tri—meet with Indiana

Although the Panthers defeat

”This was a real good, tough
match,” said Pitt coach Rande
Stottlemyer. ”The guys wrestled
well. If we can take a few of the
close matches, it is a completely
different story.”

The Panthers were trailing by

”Pat looked real good,” said
Stottlemyer. ”He went at it real
well and almost had a pin at the
end.”

Pitt was looking at a 9-4 deficit
at this point and freshman Scott
Hovan was due next. Hovan fell
behind 5-0 early, but was able to
rally in the third period to pull off
a 6-5 win that vaulted the Pan-
thers right back into the meet.

”Every match was closely con-
tested," said Stottlemyer. ”We
should have been able to pull a
few of them off.”

The Panthers fell behind for
good at 167 pounds. Pitt's Mike
Rossi wrestled hard, but just ran
out of time in the end for a 10-9
loss.

’’I was very happy with Mike's
performance,” said Stottlemyer.
”He did a good job against one
of the better wrestlers in the
country.”

The Bald Eagles were able to
take the last three matches to
make the score more lopsided
than it really was.

"We usually win the last two
matches," said Stottlemyer. ’’If
we can do that, plus win one of
the close ones, the meet is ours.

the East right now, so we didn't
embarrass ourselves.

’’In a lot of ways this was a
pleasing effort, but it wasn't a
win. 50 it is not totally satisfying.
We have to work a little harder.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, January 25, 1988

How sirhi-l_ar is the

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

NORMAN, Okla. — The Okla-
homa Sooners play in the Big
Eight Conference, while Pitt plays
in the Big East. Simple enough,
right?

So besides the obvious, what's
the difference between the two
leagues? ”[The Big Eight] is
definitely a totally different style
of play. It's a lot more physical in
the Big East. [The officials] called
things a lot different, but that's
part of the game, and you can't
complain about that,” Demetreus
Gore said.

’’I think the Big Eight Confer-
ence is softer. The refs [who hap-
pened to be from the Atlantic
Coast Conference] made a lot of
calls that wouldn't have been
called in the Big East,” Bobby
Martin said. ”That was a new ex-
perience to me. I don't know if
I handled it right or if I handled
it wrong.”

Martin seemed to do the for-
mer. He scored 13 points, includ-
ing two powerful follow jams, in
Pitt's 86-83 loss to the Sooners
Saturday.

Opponents often have plenty
to worry about facing Pitt's front-
line of Charles Smith, Jerome
Lane and Gore. But when Martin
plays to his capabilities, he can
make the Panthers’ inside game
even better.

Pitt coach Paul Evans said Mar-
tin’s recent development has ena-
bled him to use his bigger lineup
with 6—foot-9 Martin, Smith and
Lane on the front line, and Gore,
an undersized small forward,
back at his natural off—guard po-
sition.

The move worked well in the
second half as Pitt wore down the
Sooners’ front line. Yes, Oklaho-
ma came away with the win, but

they also came away with a few

bumps and bruises.
”Smith and Lane are two pow-
er horses down low,” Sooner

center Stacey King said.

”I’m sore,” added Harvey
Grant, who burned Pitt for 28
points. ”I didn't know Jerome
Lane was that strong. I know
now.”

Pitt's front line combined for 66
points and 42 rebounds.

”We thought we could get the
ball to one of the three [Martin,
Lane and Smith] because they
really did a good job on Charley,
and that left Lane and Bobby sin-
gled up," Evans said.‘

Oklahoma coach Billy Tubbs
was impressed with Pitt's inside
game. ”We thought we'd stay on
the boards with them better. It
seemed like everything Pittsburgh
shot and missed, they got it and
put it back in the basket.”

After the game, someone sug-
gested that Oklahoma had taken
Smith out of the game. Tubbs was
slightly surprised. ”We held him
to 14 rebounds. We shut him
down really good. I thought we
really took him out of the game,”

Continued from page 12

first two events (vault and bars),
but after a few falls on the beam,
the Panthers were trailing behind
UNH by .1 going into their last
event, the floor exercise. While
Pitt dazzled the cheering au-
dience with their floor routines,
UNH was competing on their fi-
nal event, the balance beam.

It is often said that the balance
beam can be the event that either
makes you or breaks you. Unfor-
tunately, that saying proved true.
UNH hit their beam sets, whereas
Pitt had a few mistakes and falls
that ultimately cost them the win.

Several Pitt gymnasts placed in
the top three on the four different
events. In the vaulting event,
junior Trish Aser placed second
with a 9.2. Senior co—captain Kim
Calderone followed Aser, placing

,

third with a 9.15. On the uneven
bars, Pitt dominated the event,
with senior Cathy Coleman and
freshman Jeannie Vecchio tying
for first with the score of 9.15.
Freshman Carrie Carnesale
placed third with a 9.05 (tied with
UNH’s Laura Paredes).

"On the balance beam, sopho-
more Shelly Sleith nailed an ex-
cellent routine, scoring a 9.15
and tying with lUP’s Rose John
son. And finally, on the floor ex-
ercise, Cathy Wallish placed third
with a beautiful routine scoring a
9.1. Other competitors who con-
tributed to Pitt's great score were
sophomore Hope Celani and
freshman Robyn Borchers. Two
more freshmen, Yolanda Powell
and Laurie Dahler, performed ex-
hibitions on the floor and vault.

Head coach Debbie Yohman

and assistant coach Ben Rovee’

were very satisfied with their
team's performance. ”I’m just so
pleased for us to score six points
better than our season opener last
year,” said Yohman. ”There were
so many strong scores out there,”
she added.

And that there were. The way
the Panthers performed Saturday
night, they look more than ready
to excel in the rest of their meets.

The excitement was obvious to
those who saw the meet. The
Panthers are off to a great start
and hope to continue their suc-
cess for the team's upcoming tri-
meet against Penn State and the
University of Rhode Island. The
meet will be held at Trees Hall on
Saturday, Jan. 30 at 7 p.m.

mocked Tubbs.

Gore led Pitt with 21 points,
and ”Ricky Grace [Oklahoma
guard] couldn't shut him down.
We went to a trick defense that
didn't trick him,” Tubbs said.

Lane also received the praise of
Tubbs. ”I think Jerome Lane is an
outstanding player. I think he
should have come to Ok-
lahoma.”

Lane wanted to do just that
coming out of high school, but
his grandmother wouldn't let

said.

While Tubbs was full of praise
for the Pitt players after the game,
he didn't have reason to act
otherwise. His team won, in-
creasing Tubbs’ record to 3-0
against Big East teams.

”What Big East team has beat-
en us? None, none  like none.
I mean this is not like we won a
world championship because we
beat a Big East team,” said Tubbs.

”If you bring any of them out
here, we'll kick their butt and
send them home. [Pitt] is the best
team in that |eague,” he added.

The closest the Panthers came
was one point, 84-83, with seven
seconds left.

Mookie Blaylock hit two foul
shots at :04, and Grant intercept-
ed a misdirected Smith pass as
the clock ran out.

Oklahoma (ranked 11th by the
Associated Press) is 16-2.

’’It was a good win for us
against an outstanding team. I
don't think we played a great
game by any stretch of the imagi-
nation. We played average, or a
little bit below average. On the
flip side, maybe youcould give
Pittsburgh a lot of credit for that

because they're an outstanding
team, and they really took it to us
inside,” Oklahoma coach Billy
Tubb said.

Gore led Pitt with 21 points,
Smith and Lane had 16 each, and
Martin added a career-high 13
points.

Pitt outrebounded the Sooners
46—34.

Smith had a season—high 14 re-
bounds, and Lane added 13.

But Pitt couldn’t stop Grant,
and Sooner center Stacey King
added 16 points, 12 of which‘
came in the first half.

tin’s play. The Sooners had
trouble handling a Pitt front line
of Smith, Lane and Martin. ”[Mar—
tin] gave us a matchup problem.
I thought he really played good.
We hadn't counted on that from
him, and we forgot to tell him be-
fore the game,” Tubbs joked.

”He really made some big
plays for them, and we couldn't
handle him inside.”

’’I thought Bobby may have
played one of his better games.
He rebounded pretty well; he
was intense and into it. I think he
gave them a matchup problem,”
Evans said.

While Evans talked about Pitt’s
despondency over the loss, Gore
thinks the Panthers will have no
trouble getting ready for tonight's
game.

” e have a lot of upperclass—

 

 

men playing, and we have a lot
of freshmen playing, but I think
the upperclassmen know you
have to always be up for the Big
East. I don't think it will be a
problem getting up for Provi-
dence,” he said.

Senior guard Delray Brooks
leads the Friars with 15 points a
game, while four other players
average over nine points.

Providence suffered its biggest
loss two weeks ago when sopho-
more center Marty Conlon quit
the team hours before the Friars’
win over Georgetown.

Conlon was the Friars’ second
leading scorer with 13.2 points.
Hist replacement is 6-10 sopho-
more Abdul Shamsid-Deen, who
missed the first eight games of the
season with a stress fracture in his
left ankle.

Providence is very similar to

Oklahoma, minus the quantity of
star athletes. The Friars love to
press all over the floor and shoot
three-pointers.

Gore thinks the Oklahoma
game was good preparation for
Providence. ”It will be the same
type of ballgame, maybe a little
more physical.”

Lady Panthers make Pirates
walk plank, end losing streak

By Matt Martin
Assistant Sports Editor

Behind Lorri Johnson's 24
points and 10 rebounds, the Pitt
Lady Panthers basketball team
defeated the Seton Hall Pirates
85-79 at the Fitzgerald Field
House on Saturday.

The victory was the Lady Pan-
thers’ first in the Big East this sea-
son and snapped a seven—game
Pitt losing streak, the longest in
Pitt women's basketball history.

Lady Panther head coach Kirk
Bruce used 11 players in the
game, five scoring in double
figures. Junior forward Deidra
Baker scored 11 points and
pulled down a game-high 11 re-
bounds

Senior forward Sally Sheerer
scored 12 points, freshman center
Connie Hurt added 11 and
sophomore guard Jennifer Shin-
gler broke out of a scoring slump
to score 13 points.

Johnson's 24 points were a
career high, coming only three-
days after the sophomore forward
had a career—high 20 points and
14 rebounds against St. John's.
Johnson has scored in double
figures in 12 consecutive games;

”We played the way we're
capable of playing,” Bruce said
after his team's best home court
performance of the season. ”We

played a lot of people, and even
those people who didn't play
double figure minutes played a
good game.” Eight of the 11 play-
ers used played at least 10
minutes.

Bruce shuffled three guards in
and out of the game to shut down
Pirates guard Kathy O’Reilly, who
averaged 10.6 ppg and had 101
assists prior to Saturday's contest.
Denise Becher, Jill Sitlinger and
Karen Threatt frustrated and ex-
hausted O’Reilly, allowing her
only seven points and seven as-
sists forcing her into five tur-
novers and four personal fouls.

Sitlinger has proven herself a
top notch reserve in the past two
games, averaging 18.5 minutes,
three points, five rebounds and
only 1.5 turnovers per contest.

Also seeing time in the game
were Shaunda Byrd, Tabatha
Long and Amy Holman, whose
spinning layup gave the Lady
Panthers their final basket of the
first half.

Pitt led 37-34 at the half.

The Lady Panthers (7-9, 1-6) led
the rest of the way by as much as
12 points with 3:52 to play, but
could not shake the Seton Hall
(7-10, 3-4) squad.

The Pirates placed four players
in double figures. Debbie Hart-
nett, the Big East's second lead-
ing scorer, poured in 21 points,

center Kim Jones scored 10,
guard Carolyn Thierfelder added
12, and Geraldine Saintilus
scored 23 points before fouling
out late in the game.

Saintilus was also called for a
technical foul when she reached
out of bounds to block a Pitt in-
bounds pass.

The win was definitely the
Lady Panthers’ most convincing
of the year. ”Now we know we
can do it,” Bruce said. ”We’re
gonna avenge every loss we had
in the Big East.”

day, Sheerer became the eighth
