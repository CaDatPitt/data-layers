‘Rifles’ Commander Men’s Honoraries Name     

Clarifies Statements

l:‘(litor'.s- note: The follouting statement u‘as .s-uI)m_itte(l to the Pitt
.\’eu‘.s' l\/londay by Per.s-hing Rifle Pres-ident Robert Rudolph. The State-
ment is in res-pmi.s-e to the lead slm'_1/ that appeared in the Pitt .\'eu‘.s-
Moiiday.

As Commander of the Pershing Rifles, I would like to report the
conversation that I had with Vic Willem, Student Government Parlia-
mentarian. In, the Monday issue of the Pitt News, Willem stated that
he “noticed a member of Pershing Rifles taking approximately 50
copies of Alternatives. As President of Pershing Rifles, I was very
anxious to know this person’s name, so I tried to find out that.person’s
name from Mr. Willem. Mr. Willem stated that he does not know that
the person is a Pershing Rifleman. The only connection he can make
between the person he saw and Pershing Rifles is that this person is
often seen walking toward either Room» 301 or Room 303 in the Stu-
dent Union.. As there are five organizations besed in Rooms 301 and-303.
it seems highly unfair to equate this person with Pershing Rifles. Af-
ter further questioning, Mr. Willem stated that he only knew the
person’s face. When asked to describe this person, here is what he
gave me: He is tall and slender and has short brownish-blond hair.
Neither myself nor any of my officers can specifically identify who
this personis from the description.

Later on in the article, it is stated “there were only three places
where these students could have gone, the Angel Flight office, the Per-
shing Riﬂe office, or Student Government.” If these newspapers ulti-
mately ended up in Rooms 301 or 303, then why didn’t Dr. Harris or
Mr. Thomas Tackage find them? After all, Mr. Tackage went through
both Rooms 301 and 303; and I urged Mr. Harris to conduct a physi-
cal search of my office. Coupled with this, during the whole time in
question (from approximately 12 noon until Dr. Harris had left the of-
fice), there was a Pitt News reporter in my office conducting an inter-
view with Jack LaPietra. I won'der why this reporter was not asked
if he had seen any extra copies of “Altematives” in my office.

Further on in the article, it is stated that Dr. Harris and Major
Gordon were “summoned to the Pershing Riﬂes Office.” I would like
to make it clear that these people did not ask me if they could come
into my office, nor were they summoned by me. I was given no choice
in the matter, I was just told that they were coming over to inspect
my office. Before I was informed that I was to be inspected, Mr. Tack-
age entered Room 303 and demanded to know where we had hidden
copies of “Altematives.” However, as I stated before, Mr. Tackage
was then given permission to search the office; but he said that he
was satisfied that ther were no extra copies there.

Also, later in the article, is stated that “Dr. Harris asked one of
the members of ROTC who was in the office at the time and how many
“Alternatives”’ had been taken by Pershing Riﬂes. According to Dr.

‘ Harris, the boy told him that they ‘had taken quite a few.’,” I was in

this office the whole time Dr. Harris was conducting his investiga-
tion. I can remember Dr. Harris talking to no one but myself; and I
know that I never said that we had taken quite a few. I told Dr. Har-
ris I had taken a few copies (50) to distrubute to the members of the
various organizations which are based in this office ( with a total mem-
bership of well over 100 members).

So we can see Mr. Willem’s whole case is- based .on_ his ‘‘identi-,
fication” of a Pershing Rifles member and on the fact that the stolen
“Alternatives” had to be in the office. It is interesting to note that Mr.
Willem could not identify the alleged Pershing Rifle member and the
stolen copies of “Altematives” were nowhere to be found in either
Room 301 or Room 303 even after search by administration and fac-
ulty members.

As Commander of Pershing Rifles, I resent the implications made
that my organization was involved on Friday. After all, the alleged
actions of any one member acting on his own cannot serve to condemn
any organization with which he happens to be affiliated.

YAWN ? ? ? ?
A John Cavaluchy’s attempt to

break the world record for con- ”

secutive hours of non-sleep was
stopped at 6 a.m. Wednesday by
fatigue. .

Moments after he passed the.
halfway point in his quest to
stay awake for 277 hours, John} ‘
became drowsy and soon the un-
bearable weight of his eyes over-
came the determined mind and
body that had fought sleep for
almost six full days.

Fellow members of Random

House aided Jonh by staying 

with ' him during the nights.
Monopoly, cards, and chess help-
ed pass the time, while records ,
and coffee helped keep him
awake.

The sudden attack of drow-
siness that put the current Uni-
versity Stay-Awake recordholder 5
out for the count came as a sur-

prise to John, for even as late ‘ I

as 3 a.m. e felt “good and"
confident” that he would crack
the existing record.

On Gun Control Issues I

Could gun control prevent an-
other assassination? Could the
State and Federal governments
effectively control the sale of
arms? Should all guns be regis-

. tered, or only handguns, or even,

only rifles? »

These and other questions will
be debated Thursday at noon in
524 SU. Attorney ‘Cris Gillotti,

' president of a local citizens group

in favor of gun control and affilia-
te_d with the'National John Glen

_ organization, -will take the affirma-

tive side, and Warren Krien, secre-
tary of f the Pennsylvania Sports-
men, will take the negative side.

,The_ debate is sponsored by the

jUniver,'sity chapter of the Inter-

collegiate Conference on Govern-

ment; (ICG). ICG is an education-
' al non-partisan student organiza-
‘’tion.'‘ It’s purpose, according to

Acting‘President Jay Rubin, is to

cess of American government a  
chance to participate in this pro- ’

cess through model conkentions,
(i.e., legislative, national, poli-
tical, congresses, constitutional,

and from a nonpartisan stand-'.».,

point.”

this year will be a mock state
legislature to be held in Harris-
burg. At this legislature, students
will prepare, submit, debate, and 1
act upon legislation and other pro- I
posals as if they were actiial mem-
bers of the legislature.

A political science major who wants to
go on to law school, Jack La Pietra has
suddenly found himself plunged into the
limelight of controversy here at the Uni-
versity. As the president of the Army
ROTC; Brigade, he was compelled by not
only the office but by his own convictions
to defend ROTC against those students
that would destroy it. In the following in-
terview, Jack was queried on those ques-
tions that are most important to college
students in order that our readers might
better know this remarkable person.

In contrast to what many people would
like the public to believe, Jack is not plan-
ning a military career. He is taking ROTC
so that he can serve his required two years
as an officer rather than as an enlisted
man. After his military hitch, he plans to
return to college and attend law school.

Jack feels no bitterness toward th e
military for interrupting his schooling. He
feels that the military’s role is “a construc-
tive one and a defensive one.” Although
he doesn’t like war. he feels that the mili-

sész Pitt News Profile es:

tary is inevitable in modern society, and,
for this reason, he feels that the Universi-
ty is the best place to intelligently discuss
the pro’s and con’s of the military. Fur-

thermore, he is opposed to a professional’

military since this would develop an “elit-
ist” group of officers and mercenaries and
remove civilian control and influence from
the most powerful a n d best organized
group in the world.

In the ROTC controversy, many stu-
dents have pointed out that a college grad-
uate can always attend Officer Candidate
School after graduation insteadof com-
mitting himself in his sophomore year.
Jack disagreed with this viewpoint since
in OCS one serves ten months as a trainee
and then still has two years of active duty
to go. Also, he pointed out, “the basic or-
ientation in OCS is toward combat duty,
and only the top ten per cent of the grad-
uates get to pick the branch they'd like to
serve in. The remaining 90 per cent in
OCS get assigned 'to combat branches. In
ROTC, all the graduates get to pick their
branch.”

He fervently denited that the military '

stifles free thinking. “In ROTC, for ex-
ample, you are presented with an assign-
ment—let’s say squad drill—but not told how
to go about teaching it. Your are limited
only by your own imagination and ability.

The persons in charge will accept any

good solution if it’s justified, since the
emphasis is on analyzing for the solution.
This whole business of stifling freedom is
ridiculous. For example, look at the article
Lt. Deegan wrote in Altematives—nothing’s
going to happen to him. We respect his
opinion.”

On the issue of Vietnam, Jack said that
“politically we’re committed. A unilateral

withdrawal on our part would be not only
detrimental buwét. also unfair to our soldiers
who are fighting and dying there. I think
it’s a shame that South Vietnam doesn’t
appreciate our efforts.”

Jack termed himself a conservative,
saying, “Any change in the status quo
should be accompanied by a good, rational
argument” In keeping with this ideology,
he expressed approval for giving the vote
to 18-year-olds because they are very well
informed and are “much more adult than

their parents were at this age.”» He went

on, “They’re fighting to defend the right
to vote so why shouldn’t they be allowed
to exercise that right?”

Beidsides holding the rank of major in

ROTC, Jack is also a member of Pershing
Riﬂes, Scabbard and Blade, Alpha Phi

Omega, the Druids, the Commuter Asso- -

ciation, and until last week, a SG senator.
He recently resigned as senator because
he lacked time to devote himself to the
most important issues which he considered
to be the roles of commuters and SG.

As a result of his personal experience
as a commuter and with the Commuter As-

sociation, he has reached the conclusion 

that the University inadvertently discrim-
inates against commuters. Besides spend-
ing long periods of time traveling and hav-
ing inconvenient schedules, he feels the
commuter is further hurt by the increase
in the cost of separate meal tickets for the
cafeteria. He also wants to establish area
“leaders” to help organize the commuters
and integrate them into University life.

Jack also expressed his support of Stu-
dent Power, saying that “Student Power
represents the opinions ot the majority of
the students. When individuals and groups
start ignoring the wishes of the majority
as expressed through petitions and refer-
endums, then it’s time to really start think-
ing about the possibility that some people
just might be using Student Power to get
themselves attention and individual power
rather than representative power.”

When asked whether he felt any bit-
terness toward SDS or any other group
that’s against him, he replied, “No, as a

’matter of fact, I defend SDS and their

right to say whatever they want. As long"

as they don’t take action to subvert my .

freedom or anyone else’s, I don’t care what
they do.”

‘Richard Nixon was the choice
“of the American people in 1968.
“ He was not the choice in 1960;

7 Just as Nixon himself has
‘changed, so have the interven-

-_ changed America. A fresh, grim
3;’. face has now become lust. It is
ricontorted between extremes of
similar logic. It is petrified with
 the fast society and the new mor-
"-ality. Americans are losing the
 little patience they once had, with
,common problems and some not
_.so common problems. For one
- reason or another time seems to
be the prevailing motive for the
 socially conscious. The prob-
lems grow worse with time. And
time is running out, according to
the radicals who continually
‘threaten already frightened Am-
xericans.
‘ FOR EVERY “What’s happen-
' ing baby?” from one side there is
a':“For God’s sake, what’s hap-
"pening?,, ricocheting back from
‘ the other side.
To describe exactly what’s hap-
pening from either viewpoint
; would be impossible for this art-
icle, but there are very obvious
events in the 60s from which we
..can,ias individuals, draw conclu-
sions.
In 1960 a young new frontier
was born with the election of the
Kennedy Administration. The Bay
of Pigs, The Missile Crisis, the
: Alliance for Progress, the Brain
Trust, Youth, Liberalism, The
Russians in Germany, the Peace
Corps, Nuclear Weapons and the
Arms Race swiftly replaced the
serenity of the Eisenhower years.
Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters,
and George Wallace on the school-
house steps contributed greatly
to the transition. SNCC, CORE,
.NAACP, SANE, and an innumer-
able number of groups either de-
veloped or grandly expanded their
operations as they assumed the
frustrating role of citizen par-
ticipants in the issues otherwise
obligated to “government only.”
A new era arrived of quasi-par-
ticipatory government in its
‘broadest sense.
‘ THAT ERA was set back on
November 22, 1963.
The Johnson administration al-
so faced a tragedy which may
very well have been the cause
of ,today’s despair — none other
than the Vietnam war. The John-
son era was also a productive one
in every area of human need.
" Martin Luther King and Robert
Kennedy were also fallen prey to

N e<wAdminis tration 

And as sexual mores, organized
religion and, in fact, the entire
conventional social organization
of the United States became more
and more controversial and open,
the youth, with all their poten-
tial, splintered into separate
camps. One large, vociferous, and
expanding group followed their
music underground, as to boycott
the rest of society. This move-
ment along with the expansion of
the left came about largely due to
the war. But the extreme right al-
so began to rustle and between «the
two, 1968 has so far been torn po-
litically with middle America vac-
illating, as a judge at a ping-pong
tournament.

RICHARD NIXON, despite his ‘

shortcomings, must be given all
the cooperation possible under
the circumstances so that he will
be given a fair chance to accom-
plish his one campaign promise:
to unite America.

Nixon’s past is certainly ob-
scure and Agnew still isn't a
household word, but they have an
advantage over any other candi-
dates: They were elected.

To dishonor them or to discred-
it them or to rehash the blem-
ishes of the past would only ham-
string the future. This article is
offering the new President a pe-
riod of grace. This is not to say
that the President should not be
criticized, for it is also our duty
to express our opinions; but it
does mean that to dig up the past
_in a frustrated effort to change
the present is not only futile but
harmful to the goal of the Ameri-
can people as well as that of the
President: unity.

‘Poor’ Proofreading Cited

Editor, The Pitt News:

Every so often an issue of the
Pitt News won’t let me rest. Let
me state the case. Your Letter

alistic ethics? Do you not con-
sider spelling and grammar, fac-

Procedures Committee.)
DAVID EHRENWERTH
Special to The Pitt News

A university should be a place
where conflicting opinions are
discussed rationally and open-
ly. When this does not take place,
the issues are clouded and confu-
sion prevails. A prime example
of such a state of affairs is the
ROTC controversy. The faculty
will now decide if academic cred-
it should be awarded for partici-
pation in ROTC courses. In or-
der for them to make the proper
decision they must be presented
with the facts and not the inac-
curate and subjective conclu-
sions of a few individuals. There-
fore, I have prepared a fact sheet
concerning the issues involved. I
publish it here so that all of the
readers of the Pitt News will be
able to argue the question of
ROTC intelligently.‘

For the past several months
there has been much confusion
over the structure and academ-
icf, merit. of the Air Force and
Army ROTC programs. The ques-
tion of awarding credit for ROTC
courses will now be decided by a
vote of the Faculty of Arts and
‘Sciences. To assist the faculty
in making its decision, I have list-
ed below the facts concerning
the issues involved.

What type of control does the

University have over the faculty ‘
‘ of the ROTC departments?

Before an-y officer becomes
a member of the ROTC faculty
his record is sent to the Chan-
cellor for approval. The Chan-
cellor may reject any officer he

portant? For instance, the Pitt
News of November 13 included
these gems: spellings such as
“tentitive,” “accredidation,”

“wharp,” “predominately”; a
phrase “to keep peace with” when
“to keep pace with” made sense;
singular verbs with double sub-

_ jects (“two days of talks and

workshops . . . is featuring Roy
Innis . . .”); an incorrect nam-
ing of a department chairman:

ROTC And The Facts

feels does not meet the Univer-
sity’s standards. The adminis-
tration may ask the Army to send
particular individuals to Pitt to
become members of the ROTC
faculty. Whenever possible, the
Army will comply. Should any
ROTC instructor not perform in
accordance with policies estab-
lished by the University, or if his
conduct is unacceptable, the in-
stitution can request that he be
replaced, and the Army will honor
the request.

What is the content of ROTC
courses?

ROTC courses cover all fac-
ets of military science. The in-
troductory courses emphasize
the organization -of the Army
and the basic forms of tactical
operations it utilizes. The re-
mainder of the courses deal with
numerous other specialized-fields
of. study. These include American
military history, commu-
nications, teaching principles,
the psychology of leadership,
military law, and world affairs.

In conjunction with Military
Science 1, 2, 115, 118, certain
credits for electives subjects
are authorized in lieu of military
subjects. These electives are
courses taught by other depart-
ments of the College of Arts and
Sciences. They include courses
taught by other departments of

the College of Arts, and Sciences. '

They include courses related to
the following topics: effective
communication, science compre-
hension, general psychology, ‘po-
litical development, and political
institutions.

Ed. Note: The following is a let-
ter from Ed Conley in answer to
Len Harmon’s letter in Monday’s
Pitt News.

Len Harmon, Capt.,
Soccer Team:

I understand your reasons for
wanting to get on good terms
with the football players, again.
But, the truth is that you did say
that which was printed in the art-
icle “Booters Refuse to Die’
that appeared in the Pitt News
last week.

You were very angry, and in-
sisted that what you were say-
ing be printed. I know that I ask-
ed you at least three times if you
were sure that you wanted those
quotes printed. You continued
to insist that they be printed.
There were enough players
around to prove this.

THE FIRST QUOTE that you
question may have been a mis-
take on my part, but I don’t think
so. It read, “The Soccer team is
not in the same boat as the foot-
ball team. We never quit.” You

‘claim that you said, “The soccer

team is not going to be put in the
same boat that the Pitt News
has put the football team in.” I
tried to be as careful as possible

 

when I heard you make this state-
ment; it was the first thing that
you said. Your claim must be
coming from memory; I had your
actual statement written down.

You called me later that night
to “clarify” yourself; you were-
n’t even sure of what you had
said, then. You told me that you
didn’t want to call the football
players quitters. _ The article
that you wanted written so badly
had already been completed. But
I did make the following addi-
tion after that quote: “He not-
ed that recently some people
have referred to the gridders as
quitters.”

THEN, YOU deny making the
statement: “Pride. The football
team doesn’t have it.” You did
say this. I don’t think you believe
this, but you insisted that what
you say be repeated. That quote
didn’t stop there either. You con-
tinued to say, “We do. We’ve
never been out of our games.”
Your letter, Monday, indicated
that I left this part out of my
article.

After your “enforced” inter-
view (I was surrounded by quite
a few angry players, and I could
see some reason. for their anger,

 

too) I spoke to your coach. Evi-
dently he overheard‘ your remarks
about the football team. I walk-
ed up to him and asked him if he
agreed with what you had just told
me. He said, “Sure, I’ll go along
with the players, except I don’t
agree in downgrading the football
team. They have enough prob-
lems.” This quote also appear-
ed in the article. I feel that it
alone is enough proof that I did-
n’t dream up the statement about
pride.

I am sorry if I have upset you,
Lenny. You certainly have sur-
prised me. You accuse me of not
mentioning the near-upset of Ak-
ron. There were four quotes in
reference to that “best game.”
There may have been a few more
if you hadn’t wanted the “anger”
story printed. And, of all the
players on the team, of all the stu-
dents in this university, you were
the last one I ever expected to
attempt to take back something
you had said (and, in fact, deny
having said it). I repeat, even if
you didn’t mean what you said,
you did say it, and you did insist

» that I print it.

Ed Conley, Sportswriter

 

‘an article which called the reason-

ing of the other side of the case
“bullshit.”

Good editors. copyreaders, and
typesetters surely can recog-
nize that even “protest” articles
are strengthened by correct spell-
ing and grammar and, yes — by
taste! Or does indifference to
taste and intelligence prove that
much of the protest activity today
is interested only in noise?
Dorothy S. Bott

Army lists certain course ob-
jectives that all military science
departments must attain. How-
ever, the instructors of Military
Science have complete freedom in
deciding which aspects of sub-
jects to emphasize and how the
subjects should be taught. Each
instructor may use any books he
feels are appropriate. Although

the Army provides manuals for _

most courses, their use is not
required. The instructors are not
spokesmen for the national pol-
icy and are free to discuss any
issue openly.

What methods of ‘instruction
are utilized in ROTC courses?

The method of instruction in
ROTC courses parallels that of
any other discipline. A syllabus
of required readings is distribut-
ed at the beginning of every
course. Each class, consists of
lectures, discussions and student
presentations. The Department
of the Army has advised the Pro-
fessors of Military Science that
all courses should be taught as
problem analyses and not as facts
to be memorized. A recent sur-
vey of one-third of all sopho-
mores," juniorsand seniors en-
rolled in the ROTC ‘programs re-
vealed that over 95% of them be-
lieve that they have an equal or
better chance to question the
statements of their military sci-
ence professors than they do the
theories of the instructors in any
other department.

How are ROTC grades deter-
mined? ’

Grades are determined strict-
ly by the academic performance
of the student. Examinations,
reports, and oral presentations
are used to evaluate the student.
The grade is not affected at all by
performance at drill or similar
activities.

Who set up the present credit
status of ROTC?

The present credit system was
the recommendation of a special

committee of the Faculty Senate. -

The Senate approved this credit
structure in 1960. A committee
of the faculty also selected the list
of electives that can be taken in
lieu of military science subjects.

What is the student body’s feel-
ing toward ROTC?

The student body was present-
ed with a referendum concerning
ROTC at the Student Government
election in January. They were
presented with four alternatives:
(1) make ROTC mandatory,
(2) offer ROTC without credit,
(3) abolish ROTC, (4) continue
ROTC as it presently exists. Of
the 2,422 students voting,
1,686 or more than two-thirds
selected the fourth alternative —
that “ROTC continue as an elec-
tive with credit toward gradua-
tion.” When the two represen-
tatives of the Student Cabinet on
the Undergraduate Council voted
to take away academic credit,
over 2,300 students signed a pe-
tition stating that these two stu-
dents were not representing the
feelings of the student body. Re-
cently, the Men’s Dormitory
Council passed a resolution sup-
porting the continued accredita-
tion of ROTC courses. '

 ‘Pitt News’ Review 

‘The Insect Trust’ Show Creativity

I W
~<

by MAGGIE LOVE

OK, Baby, Capitol’s gonna hit
you right now with this here brand
spankin new acid—rock-bullsh--
group name of “The Insect Trust.”
Trust it, Baby, these mothers give
you a heady buzz. Lotsa new peop-
le here: Bill Barth, Bob Palmer,
Trevor Koehler, Nancy Jeffries
(doin most vocals), Luke Faust (no
relation), and “Pretty” Purdie on
drums whom we all know and
love, to name a few. Bernard
“Pretty” Purdie’s got an album —
“Soul Drums,” but he does most of
his stuff backin up groups who
aren’t too affluent in the percuss-
ion department. Check him out
in “Jazz Raga.”

“The Skin Game” —- first cut,
side one, no less —— lays the hea-
vies on you: electric insect noi-
ses —- freaks you out listenin to it.
Brrrr. Crickets rubbin their legs
together is what this is. I’m just
sittin here takin it all in, folks,
one cut after the next. This next
one here, “Miss Fun City,” has
Nancy Jeffries singin and sound-
in like Joan Baez-crossed with
Maria‘D’Amato. Starts out sound-
in like “Cripple Creed,” but fools
you. Turns into a bit of jug band
music here and there, with a lotta
bugs spuzzin. Here comes “World
War I Song” . . . this group’s
more like Jim Kweskin with every
cut (even look like em) -. . . Wait!

Too many drones and whirrs for Mr.

Kweskin. Miss Jeffries suggests
herein that if Uncle Sam calls
out your man, just say, “Sorry,
he had to go to war.”

“Special Rider Blues” comin up
now on my music box. Miss Jef-
fries here hits you with a little of
that Winchester-Cathedral-singin-
into-a - megaphone — Vaudevillian-

whooper-type technique we heard-

a while back. I don’t know — I

hear a steel guitar with baritone
sax and clarinet doin almost blues
tags with a juice guitar pickin up
the clarinet part, then gettin into
a Jerry Garcia—type rif, but not

Developing Own Insect Sound

. So Soon.” This here dialogue be-

   
 

Lotta freaky leetle noises in the
background, and I think I’d flip
out tryin to identify all of em for
electric - blues - fold - jazz land.
Here comes “Goin Horne,” sort of
in the Joan Baez-Maria D’Amato
cross section vein again. Only
more like blues, with down-home,
country bottleneck guitar back-
ground _and an almost baroque
soundin alto recorder. Sounds good,
I might add.

Well, now it comes around time
to round out, sumlup, and classi-

to tell you folks whether to buy
it or not. I say, if you got the
money, go ahead. If you don’t then
it still might be worth stealin. Any-
way, these Insect Trust People

are worth givin a listen to. They
show a high creativity in the de-

MISSLOVE

so boring. Heavy, huh? “Foggy
River Bridgy Fly’s” next '— foot-
stompin, square-dancin, hay—f1op-
pin, fiddle music here. Now
comes a little banjo pluckin and
some banjo guitar. Flip the hat.

Side 2 — “Been Here and Gone

sound, which more than com-
pensates for their occasional fall-
mg into traps of musical medio-
crity. That’s enough of the in-
sects — put on a new hat, Chico.

DE BATE WIN

The William Pitt Debate
Union’s novice debaters added
to their list of successes at the
St. Vincent’s novice touma-
ment last Saturday. -The Pitt
negative team of John Iaciofano
and Pat Burns won the touma-
ment’s award for best negative
team. Inaciofano and ‘Miss
Burns also won two of the three
top individual speaker awards.

ginnin the cut is too heavy to rap
about herein. Buy it, folks, you’ll
see what I mean. Rest of the song’s
nice, violins ;— sorry folks. these
violins are dubbed‘ in by studio
musicians, not the Insect Trust
cuz they don’t use violins here. Now -
we hear “Walking on Nails”
like Gabor Szabo did a ways back,
only different, like the Insects try
to update it a little, I mean. Se-
wer drums in this one, floks. This"
is a real smutty song. Don’t listen
to it. “Brighter Than Day” up now
—- hear a car zoomin over the bridge.

Comes along Nancy singing bull- ' . ,
shit rock is all. Vocals good. De- ‘ .
serves better accompainment.

They resort to banal “Top 40” tac-
tics here — I mean, n.othin crea-
tive —— hear this every afternoon on
Chuck ,_ Brinkman. “Mountain , ‘
Song” comin on now (so am I).
Banjo guitar. Sounds like some-
one’s built themself a tabla that
didn’t work. Alto and soprano re-
corders in harmony-not a bad rif.

I VAN MEEGEREN: uusrsa roncsa

Lord llilbracken  

The exceptionally good account

of the life, work, and personality
of a deft neurotic who wanted

to make fools of art experts

and critics, and did so by painting
works that were accepted

as Vermeers and de Hooghs.

The author shows us van Meegeren
as a rebellious son; as a facile,
uninventive young painter;

as a debauched man; and, at last,
as a spendthrift so fantastically
enriched by art forgery that

no other career seemed plausible“
to him. (Van Meegeren may
originally have intended to palm
off only one picture, to prove
that it could be done, but his first
”Vermeer," Kilbracken points out,
changed that scheme; it brought

A the painter almost a hundred
and thirty thousand pounds).
Though van Meegeren cannot be
made sympathetic—he was a bitter,
sexually promiscuous dope addict,
not an engaging scamp—
Kilbracken maltes him and his
technical feats understandable.
More important, the author, in an
honest, temperate manner, makes
van Meegeren’s iustified point,-
that art ascriptions are doubtful,
and that eminent figures in the

art world are often sloppy and
confused about value in painting.

But what is more alarming is that
there has been no indication that things

They want to fire him and hire some-

onstrated and hung somebody in effigy or boycotted a foot-' ‘

. ball game. But "Mr. Carver, that is not a constructive course
0 of action. What is constructive, is when students research a
project for a couple of months, contacting some of the fore-

 

most football authorities in the country, and present a docu-

mented report of their findings complete with their humble
recommendations, only to wind up at a virtual dead end.

Is it the Athletic Directorfs position to sit back and ask

for criticism, or shouldn’t he be the one offering. new sug-
gestions and new ideas? I ‘

1 Three years and three wins is not progress. Whatever
we’re doing isn’t working. And when the football coach and
the Athletic Director work in different directions. the situ-

ation isn’t bound to improve.

Change something. Or at least indicate that there’s
a desire to improve. The status quo isn’t working. It is not

enough to say that
ly not.

things are getting better. They’re obvious-

'l‘h_ere’s another answer, too — if there’s too much oppo-
sition’ to change or if the powers that he don’t want to do the
things that a first-class football school does. The answer is:
don’t even pretend to go first class. Break some commit-
ments and de-emphasize. .

Nobody likes the second answer, least of all Frank Car-
ver. But it may soon be the only feasible one. It is impos-
ible to walk on both sides of the street at the same time.
Somebody now has to make .a decision. The football team
isn’t winning. What are we going to do about it?

“I’m not satisfied, but I’m
pleased with our performance. The
squad was excited. And, every-
one did pretty good, although a
couple of guys could have done a
little better. They ran at about
the same level as they have the
entire year,” stated Banner.

Both Banner and his assistant,
Gary Meckley, exclaimed disgust
with the poor weather conditions.
Meckley snarled, “It was wet,
muddy, and miserable.” Banner
declared that the weather was the
worst that he’s been in.

Jerry Richey, who took second
in last year’s freshmen IC4As,
finished fourth. Paul Zink and
Greg Rodgers finished more than
30 places behind Richey, while
Mike Nolan and Mark Vomhagen
ran farther back in the crowd.

 

Georgetown’s Steve Stageberg
and Holy Cross’ Art Dulong, last
year’s defending champion, were
the first two runners to tromp
through the mud and cross the
finish line.

Villanova, , Georgetown, and

' Harvard earned the top three fin-

ishing positions at the IC4As.
Meckley remarked, “Everyone in
the race was up for it, and they
were all top—notch competitors.
No doubt it was our ‘roughest
test.” In addition, Banner men-
tioned that the better teams had
tremendous quality and depth.

Banner presumed that Richey
wouldn’t be very happy about his
fourth place finish. “He ran a
tremendous race. It’s just one of
those things that happen in cross
country - he couldn’t get out of

--the pack,” said Banner.

Meckley additionally praised
Richey. “Not too many guys
would come back like he did. At
the three mile mark he was still
only about 22nd. He did a great
job. He was caught back in the
pack and used all his energy pass-
ing guys in _the mud. By the time
that he took fourth place the race
was nearly over and he had tired
himself out. The mud was over
his shoe tops.” Meckley asserted.

He indicated that had Richey
started faster he might’ve had a
better chance. Both coaches, how-
ever, believed that the IC4As

Gains 112 Against Cadets

JERRY RICHEY
Fourth In IC4A'.s-

would be a three or four man race.
Meckley remarked that Richey
had a bad break, since he had been
placed in the middle of the pack.
“He didn’t know exactly where
he stood. At one time Jerry must’ve
had about 50 guys in front of him.
He finished right up there,
though,” Meckley commented.

The coaches figured that the
squad could’ve finished a notch or
two higher, but realized that their
team would probably wind up

"about seventh or eighth. More-

over, both Banner and Meckley
were pleased with the harriers’
overall performance.

Villanova swept to the fresh-
men IC4A title, placing-five run-
ners in the first nine positions.
Banner remarked that Bob Hagner
is now in the hospital and did not
run. However, Dave Cobb “ran
his best time and did a real good
job.”

F erriss “Runs” -Panther Offense

by MARTHA HARTLE

On a rain slicked muddy
field in Pitt Stadium Satur-
day, the Panthers unveiled an
offense — Denny Ferris. When
Ferris left the game in the sec-
ond half with an injury, the
offense disappeared with him,

Ferris picked up 112 yards on

the ground Saturday —— 105 of them
in the first half. It was the third

-time this season that the 195-pound

sophomore’ ground out more than
100 yards in one game.

But just as has been the case so
many times this year, Ferris
couldn’t excape the injury bug. “I
got hurt early in the second
quarter,” he explained. “They
gave me a shot in the hip and
the more I sat out, the more it
bothered me.”

  

While he was in the game, 
Ferris was the workhorse in the
backfield. In one long drive in E
the first quarter, Ferris moved the :
ball from the Panther 30-yard line ;

to the visitor's 16 on eight con-
secutive carries.

“We used a type of lead play 3

right out of the I formation,” he
continued. “I got the handoff as
deep in the backfield as I could
and then I just looked for the hole
in the line. Our offensive line out-
weighed their deffensive line, so
we just blew them out.”

Ferris admits that the cadets
were undoubtedly keying on him
as he continued to get the call on
play after play; but the holes in
the line, were still there. “The
blocking up front was good, es-
pecially inthe first half,” he
noted.

Ferris had special praise for
the blocking of one of his team-
mates in the backfield, fullback
Tony Esposito. “Tony was blocking
real good,” continued Ferris. “I
didn’t even realize it till I saw
the films Sunday.”

Despite the fine blocking and
running in the first half. the
Panthers again failed to come up
with the big play. “It seems as if
everytime we “get in close, we
can’t go in,” reflected the speed-
ster from North Catholic. “If I
knew the answer to why, we’d have

' the problem solved. I just can’t

explain it.”

Despite Saturday’s injury, Fer-
ris anticipates he’ll be ready to go
in the season finale with Penn

' State this week. The third-ranked

Nittany Lions havean outstand-
ing runner_ in junior Charlie Pitt-
man, but Ferris doesn’t want to

DENNY FERRIS
.\“'0 Dual With Pittman

think about a Pittman-Ferris A.
duel on the gridiron Saturday. '

‘‘I don’t think I rank in the
same class as'Pittman,” Denny
commented. “There’s no com-
parison. He’s -probably gained
twice as much yardage this year
as Ihave.

“The Penn State game is a ri-
valry. So many of us players know
each other. That will be a factor
in the game. Of course we’ll be un-
derdogs, but we could beat them.”

Ferris_ considers his perfor-
mance against the Cadets this
past week as his “best ever,”, and
he’s hoping for a repeat perfor-
mance this week. “It depends a
lot on what kind of day it is,” ,
he explained; “It it’s mud and ’~
rain, that could be tough.”

But the mud and rain didn’t stop
Ferris Saturday. ‘

Booter Penalty Kicker

Crowds Don’t Bother Lou ‘Vida

By ED CONLEY

At Temple, at Grove City,
at Kent State; anywhere the
soccer team has played this
fall the majority of the crowd
reaction aimed at the boot-
ers has headed for Lou Vida.

The sophomore halfback is
made for these screams — they
don’t bother him.

“I’ve had them on my back too
long for it to bother me,” Vida
mentioned. “You don’t think of
them. If you let them bother you
it can hurt your play.”

His coach, Leo Bemis explain-
ed why the crowds get on the play-
er from Bethleham, Pa. “He’s
developed into one of our play-
makers. He’ll settle the ball
down.

“Lou was a rough player last
year,” the coach continued, “but
now he’s trying to play soccer.”

Being the playmaker is some-
thing Vida likes, too, despite the
fact that it was his scoring that
gave the kickers their latest win,
a 3-1 decision over Frostburg.

Vida scored two of the goals
in that game, thesecond one com-
ing on a penalty kick, another

duty that the halfback has picked
up during the season.

“There’s a certain thing about
it (penalty kicking),” Vida claim-
ed. “If you’re winning it doesn’t
matter, but if you’re losing or
tied it can psych you out, or you
can get psyched up.”

What has caused the sudden
improvement in his team? The
“penalty” booter answered, “It’s
a big mystery to me. I really
don’t know why.

“I thought when the guys quit
we’d be hurt,” he continued. “I
