the time that elapses while the vehi-

The average reaction time is one-

per hour travels 29 and one-third feet
before reaction is noted. An addi-

ionly person in the world who has
E gone .600 miles on a mustache.” Thus
[ stated Frank Miller, C41, lately of the
I Hobby Lobby program.

The whole affair started with the
} article on mustaches that appeared in
5 the October issue of the Panther. For
E a year, Frank had been studying and
 admiring “cookie-dusters.” “The
‘ whole thing was brought to a head
5 by Mr. Corley’s mustache,” Frank
§said. “Until I wrote that article, I
j hadn’t even thought of bringing my

" mustaches out into the open.”

Wrote Ahead

' About a month ago, Frank wrote to
E Hrbby Lobby, a national radio pro-
‘ gram that specializes in queer hob-
jbies that people from all walks of
, life follow. A week later, he received
a letter saying that his mustaches
would be considered. Another week
passed, and he received a telegram
,telling him to come to New York to
gpresent his views on the mustache
: situation to the radio public.

Arriving in New York on Novem-
ber 27, Miller was given a room in
_’ the Shelton hotel. Monday, the script
, f or the ‘orogram was written and ap-
" proved by the sponsor of Hobby Lob-
‘by. National Broadcasting company,
and Messrs. Young and Rubicon, ad-
9 vertising men who specialize in audi-
ence appeal. Tuesday and Wednes-
f day afternoon, rehearsals of the com-
plete program were held, and Wed-
‘ nesday night, Frank Miller was heard

ers will meet

school debate conference, which will
be held Saturday in the Stephen Fos-
tier Memorial. ”

The University committee- in
charge, consisting of McKenna, gen-
eral manager; Saul Dizenfeld, C39,
schedule manager, and Abe W010-
witz, C40, secretary, announces that
the conference will begin at 9 o’clock
with a general assembly.

Several rounds on the proposition,
“Resolved: That the United States
and Great Britain should form an al-
liance,” will follow the -assembly.

After lunch at 12 o’clock, the
rounds will be ﬁnished, to be fol-
lowed by a social hour at 4 o’clock.

Business Heads
Of Universities

Elect Officerscr 

G. Stanley Rupp, assistant treasur-
er of the University, was elected
president: of the Association of Col-
lege Business Oﬁicers of the Atlantic
states at the closing session of the
convention in Hotel Schenley this
week.

Mr. Rupp, a graduate of the Uni-
versity, has been assistant treasurer
and bursar for the past three years.
He represented the University at
the nineteenth annual convention of
the association.

Horace Ford, Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology, was reelected
secretary-treasurer, a position he has
held since the founding of the or-
ganization. H. I. McLean of the
University of Pennsylvania, , was

elected vice president.

As Result of Mustache Survey

.;'.

‘‘I honestly believe that I am the- all over the nation discussing the

pros and cons, types, and up
downs of mustaches.

Frank’s discussion of the misplaced-
eyebrow was practically the same as
appeared in the Panther. All refer-
ences to Hitler, however, were cen-
sored. His talk was timed to take
about three minutes on the air.

Audience Swells .

Fred Allen’s program followed
Hobby Lobby and the audience of
300 people that came to see the Fe1s-
Naptha broadcast was suddenly
swelled to 2000. Fred Allen, Frank
insists, chews gum persistently dur-
ing the program. When it is his turn
to speak, he puts the gum on the heel‘.
of his hand and steps nonchalantly
up to the microphone.

While standing in the hall of the.
studio, Frank met Mr. Gisdorf, a for-
mer English professor at the Univer--
sity. who is now working on an edu-
cational radio feature for the Parent:
Teacher’s association.

Expenses Paid

The best part of all about this trip.
to New York, according to Frank, was:
the fact that the sponsors of Hobby’
Lobby paid his complete expenses-
Pullman train fare, hotel bill, meals,
taxi-cab fore, even tips to the waiters:
were taken care of by the company-

Perhaps we had better wire to New.‘
York and warn Hobby Lobby of the
great number of application letters
that will be coming from the vicinity

 and

of the University of Pittsburgh.

‘Our Town’ Praised

B N ie ‘ e
y ews Rev W r
By Dorothy Hughes

In this, his latest and most successful play, Thornton
Wilder has used the same sort of material that Leonid
Andreyev, the Russian symbolic: dramatist, used in his
“Life of Man,” but with an optimism in tragedy that is
as typically American as is the fatalistic pessimism of
the latter’s art typically Russian. A

This plot material is taken simply and without any
overwhelming emotional climax from the day—to—day
life of two families living in a, small American town. If
it can be said that there are climaxes at all, these occur
in the second act with the marriage of the son and
daughter of each family and the accompanying_o3mo-
tional reactions of the young couple; and in the third
act, with the heartbreak of Emily, the bride, when, after
her death, she tries to live over “the most unimportant
day” of her life. ’ " ”

Almost Barrie-like

Wilder is almost Barrie-like in his ability to cap-
ture in a few whimsical words of dialogue the humor
and the pathos of lovable humanity. Lovable, forias
Wilder sees him, man is lovable as well as foolish and
heroic.

In characterization, Wilder reaches the peak he
achieved in his one act play, “The Happy Journey to
Trenton and Camden,” and again with -his creation of
the half-wise, half-ignorant, wholly tender middle‘-class
mother. Mrs. Gibbs, especially, is real and delightful.
Dr. Gibbs, with the mellow wisdom of a country doc-
tor, and Mr. Webb, with the tolerance born of long
years spent editing a small-town newspaper, arc hu-
manly and sympathetically pictured.

Wilder’s use of the stage-manager in the conven-
tional manner, of the Chinese is both novel and effective.
As in Chinese drama, the stage manager is constantly
on the stage, setting a chair here to represent a wall,
a ladder there to represent an upper room; unlike the
Chinese ﬁgure, however, he is not dressed in blue, the
symbol of invisibility to the Chinese.

Points A Moral

Every day living——that is the keynote of the entire

play, which does what Oscar Wilde says a play must‘

never do: it points a moral, the essence of which is:
Life, no matter how humdrum or routine, painful or
precarious, is worth enjoying deeply every moment of
every “least important day.”
The following new books have been added to the
University’s library:
R. E. Byrd, Alone.”
John Gunther, “Inside Europe.”
Ernest Hemingway, “The Fifth Column."
C. Jackson, “Life of Chevalier Jackson.”
Paderewski, “Memoirs.”

be gained by coalitions. V

Nominations for the party slates
will be made at a convention of all
the-members of the party. Not only
will candidacy be passed on, by the
rank and ﬁle, but the party‘ platform

No More Log-Rolling

That way there.won’t be any need
for deals. O'rganized'groups, such as
the fraternities, dents, unaffiliated or
“independent” parties won’t have to
trade off oﬂices, dance chairmanships,
SFA representation or honorary tap.-
pings to gain each other’s support :'for
their own candidates.

All this is what the leaders of the
new party hope to do. All of this,
therefore, raises a formidable ques-
tion for the remnants of last year’s,
“plebescite coalition” to face.

The independents aren’t wasting
any time in organizing a solid party.
They’re matching the dents with an
“engineers machine.” Pledge cards
are being earnestly solicited from
voters of other schools on campus.

' Open And Above-Board

There are two meetings, every
week to keep up interest, and two of
the most vital leaders, I-Ioeveler and
Stark are giving full-time to running
the group. There are no fees, or
threats; Above all, the _card-signer
is made to feel that he is on the in-
side, that everything is open and
above-board and that nothing is be-
ing hidden from him,

Against this the fraternity-inde-
pendent-dent combination w 0 u _l d
have :1 tough struggle at the next
election. But the question of the
merit system is political dynamite.
It’s one thing to ask‘ a prospective
voter for support because the candi-
date is your friend, or his, but it is
quite another to make him feel that
he ought to indulge in a crusade to
protect his rights and to free Univer-
sity politics from unclean domination.

Not Anti-fraternity

Not that the independent group is
conducting an anti-fraternity drive,
but the mere statement of their aim
will leave the “plebesciters” with a
moral argument to answer. And
isn’t there some saying about “clean-
Students will sell

In opposition, right now, the coali-
tion looks woefully weak; and rumors
of dissension exist among the fra-
ternities; due to PiKA Widney’s small
vote last year, it is questionable
whether the dents can be delivered;
and there is little left of the old in- '
dependents unless Delt Kairys and
Bobby Adams can deliver the mili-
tary.

Above all it will be interesting to
see how the present campus political
rulers meet the reform problem.
What’s the answer. Downie‘?

In Week-End Intramurals

Action in the Engineering and In-'9
dependent Leagues today is limited?’

to three matches in two sports, vol—-
leyball and table tennis, as the fra--;
ternities dominate the scene. 

Newman Club and the Rainblersg
Independent touch football ﬁnalists,
square off again on the Trees Gymi
volleyball court at 5 o’clock. The;
game will be the second of the sea-
son in the Independent League.

Engineering ping-pongers go to
it at 4 o’clock when the Chemical
Engineers meet the Electricals. The
Metallurgists and the Industrial En-
gineers Iace each other across the
table tennis court at 5 o’clock.

Two More Teams

The entrance of two more teams,
the Arrows and the Independent All
Stars, brings the Independent en-
listment to 14 clubs, including a 10
team basketball league. However,
more table tennis and bowling out-
ﬁts are still needed. Players are re-
minded that they need enter no
more than one sport if they so de-
sire.

First day matches resulted in lop-
sided scores in both volleyball and
basketball. The Danes took an
early lead in the Independent loop
volleyball division with a 3-0 win
over Kappa Alpha Psi. Match
scores were 15-5, and 15-9.

Life Savers

All those interested in the life
saving course leading to senior
Red Cross certiﬁcates should re-
port to the Trees Gym Pool at 1
o’clock, Monday, December 12.

' Karl Oermann

A misunderstanding in the time

of the game brought out incomplete
teams for the Chemical Engineers-
Civil Engineers basketball contest,
and the Chemicals took a 6-0' deci-
sion in an abbreviated, slightly
sloppy engagement.
Electricians Win

Lawb sank a foul shot for the In-
dustrial Engineers and led his
team’s scoring as the Electricals
submerged the Industrials under a
22-1 pasting. Wilkenson and Dugan
each hit the hoop with four ﬁeld
goals to emerge with the point-mak-
ing honors.

In the evening's ﬁnal, the Metal-
lurgists proved to be better foot-
ball than basketball players as they
were srnothered by the Oil and Gas
five. 24-2. Underwood dropped in
the Met’s lone ﬁeld goal while Wat-
son, Hendreckson, and Collins divid-
ed up the major share of the scor-
ing for the winners, the first two
with three ﬁeld goals apiece and
Collins with two double deckers and
a brace of fouls.

Ice Line-up

Change

After a two-day rest hockey
Coach John Mcsorley, yesterday
began preparing his squad for its
game with Baldwin Wallace next
Tuesday.

Baldwin-Wallace, losing to Car-
negie Tech, 2-0, in their ﬁrst game
of the season, had little to show and
should not cause Pitt much
trouble.

“We hope to take them in the
stride,” says Coach Mcsorley, “but
anything can happen in hockey. I
can’t ever feel confident—the team
has a bad habit of letting down after
they get ahead.”

Defensively the team is weak.
With the front lines slow on check-
ing back and the defensemen not
playing their position, Goalie Ellis
has found himself in needless trouble
more than once.

Oﬁensively the team has improved
since the first game. The passing
is more consistent and accurate but
there is still no follow-up after long
shots.

With these faults in mind Mc-
Sorley 1s contemplating a radical
change in line-up before the game.

Panthers Out To Flatten Wildc‘ats
With Ice Cream, Latest Slogan

PAGE THREE

By Bill Mazefsky
Figure eight, ice cream, and “en-
thusiasm and energy” come to the
sport page tomorrow night at Evans-
ton, Illinois, when Dr. H. C. Carlson’s

Pitt Panther basketball team opens
the 1938-1939 season With the
season with the Northwestern Wild-
cats on the other side of the courts.

The ice cream fed Panthers seldom
go into a season without a new Carl-
son phrase or technique. From last
season's “Win ’em all” the slogan
shifts to the current “energy and
enthusiasm.” With plenty of ice
cream after the game and plenty of
ﬁgure eight passing during the game,
{ the contemporary Panthers are likely
not to feature last year’s elimination
offense.

Elimination offense is one of the
items that passed with last year’s
i varsity, and the only item that Carl-
son will probably not miss. Maybe
the 1938-1938 basketball season will
see a new offensive style and maybe
the only new offensive will simply be
a series of slogans and quips.

The varsity that answers the open-
ing whistle will be green but prom-
ising. Four sophomores, Larry Patt-
rath, Eddie Straloski, Mel Port and
Jimmy Klein will team with Bob
Johnson, junior, on the‘ first team.

The second ﬁve is straight ﬁrst
year with George Kocheran, Dan
Vujnovic, John Pataky, Al Reeves,
and Sam Milanovich. These two
team together with two additional
men, not yet selected by Coach Carl-
son, will comprise the Pitt traveling
squad, that leaves for the Mid-West
basketball lands today.

Facing an eighteen-game sched-
le this year’s team follows a squad
that last season turned i-none of the
three poor records of Carlson coach-
ed squads. The _1937-1933 brigade
failed to. keep their heads aboventhe
L500 waters; winning nine and losing
twelve. ' I ' "

Panther reserves will be strong
this year," and Pitt may be able to re-
vert to a two-team system with small
loss" ‘of strength.’ First‘ team men
are being pressed for their positions
by thesurging play of that se_cond
team. This pushing by s.e.;c9Iid
stringers keeps the varsity p_n"'pla'y-
ing edge and keeps coaches 
Dr. Carlson is smiling.

Pitt Briddgs
Go West, South:

There is no bowl for the Panthers
this year, but this doesn’t mean that
there won't be any trips nor any
football for certain members of the
Panther varsity. A

The invitational lists haven’t been
fully completed yet, but trains pull-
ing out of the Pennsylvania Station
one week from Sunday and heading
both west and south will contain six
Pitt men.

Marshall Goldberg, Curly Stebbins
and Bill Daddio will head for the
Pacific coast, territory that is not
unknown to them. They have been
selected by Andy Kerr to play on
the East team that meets the West

‘ in the San Francisco Shriners game

on New Year’s Day.

Steve Petro, Johnny Chickerneo,
and Fabian Hotfmann have accept-
ed invitations, to try a little more of
the southern hospitality. They will
go down to Montgomery, Alabama

Bill Kelly, Blind Freshman, May
Become Pitt Varsity High Jumper

By Joe Kristufek
When Coach Olson sends out his
call for track prospects each season,
he expects and receives candidates
of all shapes, sizes and abilities.

But this year he received more
than he ever expected, when Bill
Kelly showed up. Although only
a freshman, Bill, and his seeing-
eye dog, Pete, are familiar ﬁgures on
the campus because of his work in
the Glee Club, and on the Panther
and Owl staffs.

Auditory Rhythm

Few people expected him to add
athletics to his other activities, but
that is exactly what he has done.

One week ago he reported to
Coach Olson and announced that he
was going out for track. Bill has
liad.many obstacles to overcome-
now that he has turned to track, he
is going to jump over them. For
Bill is going to be a high jumper.

Each afternoon at 3:30 o’clock Bill '
reports to Pete Bennett, the Univer- 
slty record holder in the high jump, 
for instruction. Pete has a uniquef.
-coaching problem in trying to teach;
Bill to high jump, for never before}
in the history of inter-collegiate:
s}.‘orts. has there been a blind high?

jumper.
High jumping, according to the-
c:-;per‘..<. is dependent upon vision]

to a great degree. So a new method
of jumping will have to be created
for Bill Kelly.

But Pete Bennett has already per-
fected this new system and each day
he works for hours with Bill, teach-
ing him the principles of rhythmic
motion. He uses a phonograph rec-
ord to teach Bill the sense of uner-
ring rhythm that he must develop
if he is to perfect his jumping tech-
nique.

Thus, they are building "in Bill
an auditory sense of rhythm which
will take the place of the muscular
rhythm that is so important in ath-
letics.

The greatest problem, however,
that confronts Bill and his coach
is that of balance. In all athletics
an acute sense of balance is ex-
tremely important, but in high
jumping perfect. balance is more im-
portant than in any other sport.

Time VVill Tell

Now if you don’t think your eyes
have a great deal to do with your
equilibrium, just close them and
tiy to walk a straight line. You will
ﬁnd that it is practically impossible
to maintain any sense of balance, for
the eyes control the semi-circular
canals which in turn determine the
sense of balance.

Whether or not Pete Bennett and
Bill Kelly can overcome this funda-
mental law of nature, whether or
not they can instill an artiﬁcial
sense of balance that will be as acute
and effective as nature’s normal
sense of balance, is a question that
they are not prepared to answer
just now.

Weeks of Practice

For it takes weeks and weeks of
tedious practice before any primary
evaluation can be made. But this
much is certain: If wisdom, and
effort and bull-dog determination
can surmount the seemingly insur-
mountable obstacles that stand in
Bill Kelly’s pathway to athletic
fame, then he shall overcome them.

Right now it doesn’t seem very
important whether Bill becomes pro-
ﬁcient as a high jumper or not, for
day in and day out he has mani-
fested a quiet cheerfulness in his

will mean much more to Bill Kelly
in the years to come than

as

mean.

Just the same, don’t be surprised
if in a year or two Bill represents the
University of Pittsburgh in the high
jump.

In the evening the P_.iKA bowlers
took two out of three matches from
Phi Gamma Delta. Leading the
PiKA pinmen were Taylor" and

The ping pong matches in the aft-

for the winners. The opening match
between Phi Epsilon Pi and Pi

Bowling matches in the evening

THE PITT NEWS

Ileinz Chapel Windows Signify

Christian Virtues Through Color

Much of the beauty of the Heinz¢
I givleinorial Chapel in its architectural!
 ‘and inspirational details has been?

ascribed by its designers to the col-1
orful stained glass windows. '

Following the late medieval styles
used throughout the building, the;
stained glass windows were designed}
to carry, through their bright col—3
ors, stories with a full meaning. 

Colors Symbolic '_

Colors were particularly signifi-i
cant. Red symbolized divine love,§
passionate devotion, and self-sacri-‘I
fice; gold, spiritual achievement and;
the treasures of the earth and ripe}
harvests; green combined the wisdom !
of blue and the wealth of gold; and;
violet, through the unity of red and!
blue, signified justice. White, as al-
ways, symbolized faith, serenity, and
the purity of peace. ’ '

The memorial window to the late
H. J. Heinz, presented as a special
gift to Mr. Heinz’s grandchildren,
has for its theme “Life as a Spir-
itual Adventure.” This is the theme
carried out in particular throughout
all 23 chapel windows.

In the medallion at the top of the
memorial window is St. Bonaven-
ture, holding a scroll which reads,
“O Come All Ye Faithful.” Below
are scenes from the story of the
birth of Christ, the shepherds leav-
ing their flocks when they see the
star shining over Bethlehem; the
'-Jlagi offering gold, frankincense, and
myrrh; animals kneeling; children
playing musical instruments; and the
Christ Child surrounded by
bearing scrolls with the words of
the hymn on them.

Show Christian Virtues

The four striking tivansept windows
in the highest part of the chapel
tell from top to bottom the stories
of men and women whose characters
exemplified true Christian virtues,
from ancientfto modern times. The
window symbolizing courage, for
instance, has David, St. George, and
Alfred the Great, the early English
king who delivered England from
Danish invasion. Alfred is shown
watching the cakes burn on the fire-
place, as old legends’ relate.

The relationship ‘between religion
and science is shown on the" truth

sity of Melbourne. which -:0‘-rrcsponds
to an English public school. ‘Walker,
who is very interested in department
store work, investigated various
schools offering graduate courses in
this ﬁeld. He ﬁnally decided that the
University’s Retail Bureau was the
best suited to his needs.

Shocked Twice

After receiving a letter of best
wishes from the prime minister and
an admonition from the family cook
to be careful because “America is a
bad country,” Mr. Walker began his
long journey. In order to hang on
to the protection of the Union Jack
as long as possible, he crossed the
continent through Canada.

Mr. Walker’s ﬁrst shock came
when he saw the ominous looking
revolvers that the American “bob-
bies” carries. His second was the
very cold weather we have been hav-
ing of late, since it never snows in
Australia. Mr. Vvalker will probably
spend a pleasant winter sitting on
radiators.

It sems that Mr. Walker is almost
as fascinated by our American wise-
cracks as some gushy females are by
his veddy deﬁnitely English accent.
He has made a hobby of collecting
unusual expressions and sends them
home.

has received from Australia since
the Civil War was the call Mr.
Walker recently received from his
father on the occasion of a birthday.
