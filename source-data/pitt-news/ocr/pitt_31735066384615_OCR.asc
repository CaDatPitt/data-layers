CAS Deon Search Claimed Limited

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staffwriier

The search for a successor to College of Arts and
Science Dean Robert Marshall continued yesterday
with an open meeting of a ten-member search
committee comprising faculty appointed by the
University and students elected by the Student
Government Board.

The meeting brought charges leveled by
non-committee faculty members that the procedure
for selection of the dean (as directed in by-laws
distributed by the Provost’s ofﬁce) severely limits the
committee’s hold on the ﬁnal decision of who is
selected to ﬁll the empty slot.

The rules call for the submission of the names of
several candidates from the search committee to the
Chancellor in alphabetical order rather than
categorizing the candidates in order of qualification or
desirability for the job. The Chancellor then has the
privilege to reject all of these candidates and name a
successor of his choice if he sees fit, regardless of the

Pitt Thornburgh-Specter Debate Off

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt's Debate Union cancelled a debate scheduled

 for Wednesday between Republican gubernatorial

candidates Richard L. Thornburgh of Pittsburgh and
Arlen Specter of Philadelphia after Thornburgh
advisors announced he would not attend.

Barry Stern, a spokesman for the Thornburgh for
Governor office in Philadelphia, contended their ofﬁce
never made any committment to appear at Pitt.

“We never firmly agreed to debate with Arlen
Specter at Pitt," Stern said. “We send out
conﬁrmation letters when Thornburgh agrees to
speak, and we never sent out a confirmation letter on
this matter.”

Organizers for the debate and WEEP radio believed
there was a firm commitment by Thornburgh to
appear at Pitt. Detailed planning for the_debate
involving. Thornburgh’s representatives had been
completed. Joe Field, WEEP president, said Thomas
Kane, associate professor of speech at Pitt, had

 eady negotiated the length of opening and closing
~.'.ii ’

tements to be made by the candidates.

According to Field, Thornburgh advisers wanted
eight-minute opening speeches, while Field wanted
three-minute openings. Kane convinced Thornburgh
representatives to agree to ﬁve-minute openings.

James M. Seif, who schedules Thornburgh’s
appearances, told Mike Weiler, an assistant to Kane,
that Thornburgh had chosen to appear in the
Philadelphia area instead of Pitt.

“He (Seit) told me other campaign appearances in
Philadelphia were more attractive than coming’ to
Pitt,” Weiler said. “He mentioned a similar debate at
the University of Pennsylvania speciﬁcally.”

Martin C='Malley, a student helping to organize the
debate at Penn, said only Arlen Specter and
Democratic gubernatorial candidates Pete Flaherty
and Robert Casey appeared at the debates there.

“Mr. Thornburgh did not make it, and we didn’t
expect him to appear,” said O’Malley. “His advisers
told us he was planning to appear at Pitt.”

Stern said the contradictory statements made by
organizers about Thornburgh planning to appear to
both Pitt and Penn the same day resulted because of a
communications breakdown within the Thornburgh
campaign ofﬁce.

In a letter delivered to Thornburgh’s campaign '

headquarters, Specter said he still wished to debate
with Thornburgh in the Pittsburgh area.

“In any event, Ithink it is important that you and I
have a head-to-head confrontation promptly,” the
letter stated.

“Accordingly, I am making arrangements to
purchase 30 minutes of TV time on a station in the
Pittsburgh area,” the letter added.

A spokesman said Thornburgh has debated Specter
in the past, and is willing to again, but added that no
response to Specter’s letter was yet prepared.

“Dick Thornburgh would be glad to debate Specter
if it were a statewide debate and all candidates were
involved in it,” Stern said.

“We should be concerned with these procedural
problems,” said associate professor of political
science Jonathan Harris. “A rule such as this could
possibly make the ﬁndings of this committee

Harris also suggested the committee 'search the
University community for qualiﬁed candidates rather

than waiting to receive applications for the position
from which Marshall resigned in January, effective
June 30.

“We must compile a short list of only the top
candidates,”‘Harris said. “This is a matter that

cannot be left entirely to the control of the Chancellor.”

Other flaws that were believed to exist within the
selection procedure were cited by Dr. Jerome
Schwartz, associate professor of French.

The procedural rules really distress me, par-
ticularly the feeling in the by-laws that time is of
the essence,” Schwartz said. “We had a resignation
in January from this position obviously because there
was something wrong within the college. I think we
should take time out to air these problems rather than
rushing out to find someone to fit into a preconceived
structure of the office of the dean.”

Concern was also raised as to the dean’s position in
the University hierarchy in which the dean Of the
College of Arts and Sciences is subordinate to the
dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences._

“No one likes to apply for a job where the autonomy
is limited from the very beginning,” said Harris. “In
addition to this, the fact that the dean of CAS has no
control on the budget leaves him strapped.”

Several faculty members discussed a move
currently being pushed by the Provost’s office to raise
the standards of admission and recruitment by
seeking only the top high school students.

Student Lobby

Pushes For g  
Drinking Bill

By TOM M. KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt students traveled to
Harrisburg Tuesday to lobby
for passage of the 19-year-old
drinking bill, currently in the
state House Committee on
Liquor Control.

The bill passed the Senate
last year, 27-21, and is
expected to be debated on the
House floor sometime in
mid-June.

Todd Park, chairman of the
Governmental and Public Rela-
tions Committee (GPR) of
Student Government, said the
lobbyists concentrated their
efforts on representatives and
legislators who abstained the
last time the bill was before the
House (1973).

“We went out to the people
who didn’t vote the last time,”
Park said. “There were also

Chilean Government Blasted By Ex-Officials

By DAVE KIRSHNER
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Education should ﬁnance itse1f...the state
has paid too high price for the universities...”
These are not the words of an irate legislator in
Harrisburg, they are taken from a statement by
a Chilean government leader. According to two
exiled officials, this ruling military regime in
Chile is crippling academic freedom and
human rights there.

Speeches by Drs. Enrique Kirberg and
Roberto Belmar at Pitt’s Law Building
Wednesday attempted to raise consciousness
about the Chilean “reign of terror,” which is
having devastating effects on the country’s
universities.

Massive tuition hikes and scholarship
reductions have put education beyond the
reach of all workers and peasants, according to
Belmar, a former deputy director of the
National Health Service in Chile.

“Before the 1973 coup,” he said, “the idea

0 was to bring in the workers who were in the

factories to become doctors, nurses, laboratory
technicians. You could become a doctor
without paying a dime, practically.”

“Education was to serve the society. These
were the principles of the university.”

Not only has the accessibility of education
been altered in Chile today, but so have the
rights of the people within the universities.

“National anthem singing is obligatory,”
explained Kirberg, former president of the
State Technical University of Chile. “It is
dangerous for students to be silent. You have
to speak, but say nothing.”

The junta also has increased its military
control over the entire educational system by
changing the curriculums.

“Some courses on history and the political
and social sciences have been replaced by
those on national security,” Kirberg said.
“There has been a militarization of the
schools.”

“When the coup overthrew the Allende
government ﬁve years ago 25,000 students
were expelled, 35 pecent of the teachers were
fired. Many of those were jailed and eventually
killed.” ‘

Kirberg was one of the few who were
imprisoned and managed to leave Chile.

“I myself was put up against the wall to be
shot, but they changed their minds,” Kirberg
said.

A teaching offer from Columbia University
released him from jail and subsequently
enabled him to come to the United States.

“Some people just disappear, though,”
Kirberg said. “Many university officials,
doctors, newspapermen, economists, actors
and hundreds of students were kidnapped by
the police of the junta.

“One professor asked his students a
controversial question in class and the next day
he was gone. He hasn't been heard of since."

certain areas that voted against
the bill.”

Those areas, according to
Park, were the black repre-
sentatives from the inner cities,
the so-called bible belt (central
Pennsylvania), and conserva-
tive legislators across the state.

Park said there is a 50-50
chance of the bill passing. In
1973, the House defeated a
similar bill, 95-94; 102 affirma-
tive votes are needed.

Accompanying Park on the
trip were Mark McKillop and
Allan Brooks of the GPR.

McKillop said passage of the
bill could prove difficult.

“I’m still skeptical,” he
said. “I feel the law will pass
eventually. But not quite yet.”

Both Park and McKillop
agreed that the vote in the
House would be very close.
The closeness of the Senate
vote is exempliﬁed by the
voting of Allegheny County
Senators; four voted against
the bill, and three votes in
favor. Senators Thomas Nolan,
Edward Zemprelli and James
Romanelli (representating
Pitt’s,district) voted in favor of
the bill.

Park said representatives
against the bill have used the
argument of increased trafﬁc
deaths in states with lower
drinking ages. Students count-
ered this fact with the
suggestion that many under-
age drinkers in the state who
live close to a bordering state
often travel across state lines to
get beer and liquor, Park said.

If the drinking age were
lowered, he asserted, they
would not have to drive across
the border, possibly lowering
the number of accidents. Park
said a recent Pitt News poll,
showing that 83 percent of Pitt
students use alcohol, and a
similar survey at Penn State,
which claimed 84 percent, use
alcoholic beverages, could not
be neglected.

Park and McKillop said less
success was achieved in lobby-
ing for the decriminalization of
marijuana.

“Pennsylvania doesn’t ap-
pear to be ready for that,”

McKillop said. “There is a
very slim chance of that
passing.”

“If they voted their con-
sciences, they would vote for
decriminalization, ” Park said.
“It would be optimistic to say
1979 would be the year for
passage of that law.”

rejected by the College of Arts and

The measure was defeated by a
5-3 vote. One abstention was re-

The result was expected. In pre-

Both Kirberg and Belmar agreed
that President Carter’s stance on
human rights has helped make
some changes, but questioned
whether the administration has
done enough to hlep reestablish a
democracy in Chile.

“Chile has a special way of
resistance of its own,” Kirberg
said. “There are no terrorist groups
and guerillas, instead it’s a mass of
resistance.”

“There pressure of the people is
causing change. There is a kind of
split in the armed forces now. The
people are saying we're going to go
from a state of seige to a state of
emergency.”

culture destroyed.”

general dissatisfaction with the
proposal, which, if passed, would
have merged laboratory courses on
the freshman and sophomore levels
into one special sophomore-level

would be enacted “at the expense
of the undergraduates.”

This stance was contrasted to the
one taken by several heads of the
biological sciences department, at
the last two Council meetings.

Department chairman David

yesterday’s meeting. Addressing
the Council, he contended the
proposal was “a popular one on
pedagogical grounds.” Accord-

laboratory hours would allow

“We have decided on pedagogi-

from four to three,” Sussman said.
“Practice in other schools across
the nation is practically similar. I
don’t know of any school, in fact,
that has more than three core

Several Council members disa-

the most vehement in expressing
such dissatisfaction.

“All he's (Sussman’s) really

New Dean Search Claimed Limited

(Continued from Page 1)

“With all this talk around the University about an
elitist honors—type of ‘situation at Pitt we must
remember several things,” said Joel Reed, director of
the University Community Educational Programs
(UCEP). “We must remember Pitt is a state-related
institution that receives more than $60 million a year
from every taxpayer in Pennsylvania. We have an
obligation to serve a multi-ethnic student body of all

capabilities,” Reed said.

He stated CAS needs a type of clean who will

support these needs.

Harris agreed with Reed, noting the new dean
should not concentrate all recruitment efforts in the
direction of “elitist or snob” programs but should
direct some of his energies to the area of “remedial”

work.

Student Government Board member Diane Behers
called for the selection of a dean who would “always

have the interest of the students in mind and always
be available to the students in need of assistance.”

She also noted that the new dean should actively
support the administration in teaching evaluation and
expansion and improvement of the CAS advising
center. Virtually all in attendance supported Behers
statements that the new Dean must foremost be
interested and receptive to the needs of students,
while being able to construct a suitable rapport with
students and faculty alike.

“The tone of our discussions has to be one of.

getting these students involved with the things that

"72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Thomburgh’s No-Show

Richard Thornburgh’s nonappearance at Pitt for a planned
debate with Arlen Specter cannot be excused as a mere misunder-
standing between Thornburgh campaigners and organizers of the

debate.

When debate organizers discussed with campaign personnel the
format of a debate, the plans have obviously progressed beyond the

preliminary stages.

If WEEP paid the time and expense of in—

stalling telephone lines in the Student Union, the Thornburgh
organization must have signified at some point that he was going to
appear. Failure to appear after making these arrangements shows
extreme incompetence on the part of Thornburgh’s staff.

Leaving the Debate Union with the impression that Thornburgh
planned to participate in the debate, and then informing debate
organizers that he was not appearing the day before the debate was

an act of extreme carelessness.

When Thornburgh’s campaign strategists claim.he planned to
appear at a debate at the University of Pennsylvania when he was
actually campaigning in Carnegie, carelessness 1S compounded with

deceit.

Such shoddy dealings by the Thornburgh for Governor cam-
paign office reflects on the ability of Thornburgh to serve as gover-
nor of Pennsylvania. Thornburgh selected the men who serve in his
campaign office, and selection of such a group of bunglers suggests
Thornburgh is a very poor judge of character. Such a judge cannot
select advisors to help him with the decisions vital to the future of

our state.

theory, and insisted that Lee
Oswald’s lone gunmanship was
responsible for the Dallas tragedy.

Opinion

But even FBI experts have been
unable to repeat by experiment the
assassin’s score with the time and
type of weapon allegedly used.
Also, Specter has glibly ignored
Oswald’s links to both the CIA and
FBI, and Jack Ruby’s ties to
syndicate crime.

Specter served as our common-
wealth’s co-chairman of the 1972
Committee to Re-Elect the Pres-
ident, and in 1973, his President

hoped to enlist his talents for
obfuscation in Nixon’s legal
defense.

Specter refuses to discuss the
evidence for an assassination
conspiracy anymore.

If Attorney Specter wants to rid
our state of corruption, perhaps he
should move out.

their pride, and make their
presence known. Also, any straight
person wearing their usual blue
jeans on this day would get a taste
of the predjudice gays face in their
day-to-day lives.

Besides publicizing and partici-
pating in Blue Jeans Day,
members of Gay Supporters at Pitt
have been involved in the
formation of the Pittsburgh Com-
mittee for Human Rights. The
prime function of this committee
will be demonstrating Anita Bry-
ant's speaking engagement at the
Civic Arena May 22.

Bryant will be the keynote
speaker at the Charismatic Catholic
Conference, sponsored by Du-
quesne University, and is due to
speak on “the encroaching evils of
homosexuality” and her own

anti-gay campaign, Save Our
Children.

Since Bryant is believed to be
backed by the Conservative Caucus,
which seeks to supress women’s
and labor’s rights, a wide variety of
socially concerned groups and
individuals will be participating-
not just gays alone.

Remember that the denial of any
group's basic civil rights affects the
level of freedom of the whole
society. Anyone with concern for
human rights for all is encouraged
to participate in the preparation and
actual demonstration.

And the gay community at Pitt,
show your pride‘ and wear your blue
jeans on April 14!

‘President’s Best Buddy Inc.’ New Lance

Venture

By MARK MURPHY

Not long ago, Bert Lance,
President Carter's former director
of the Office of Management and
Budget, was called into the White
House to discuss his conduct since
leaving government. Immediately
after he resigned from OMB, Lance
established his own business,
President’s Best Buddy 1nc., and
began courting clients who might
need a direct hotline to his old boss.

But, Bert being Bert, it seems he
is in some hot water at the Carter
White House. Recently, Lance was
summoned to Washington for a
little chat with Hamilton Jordon, the

President’s oh-so-special assistant.
The meeting was taped (you mean
Democrats tape, too?), and the
transcript now can be published:

Jordan: Bert, hey, how you
doing? C’mon right in here and sit
down, What’s new, you ﬁnancial
son of a gun?

Lance: I’m fine, Ham. What did
you call me in for? T

J: Well, I was just wondering if
everything was O.K. for you. How
is life back out in the jungle?

L: You know, same old stuff. Just
trying to make a buck. The kind of
thing I did before. Remember how I
would work——pull a shady deal here
and there—outfox the government?

J: Bert? f‘

A Great Concert N 0 Small Feat for Little Feat

By KEITH BRIAN
Pm News Staff Writer

Pittsburgh concert buffs haven't
had a concert of this caliber since
Rod Stewart's Arena appearance in
the fall of 1976. Little Feat followers
ﬁlled the aisles as well as the seats
of the Leona Theater Wednesday
evening.

The six-man band filled the
smokey air over the audiences with
a sonic phenomenon of rock’n’roll.

"Fatman in the Bathtub” got the
crowd's “feat" wet with the music
that proved the Leona Theater’s
acoustics are not beyond hope, if the
technicians are good enough.

These virtuosos of contemporary
music, led by Lowell George.
weaved their melodious tones into
"Time Loves A Hero’ '. Twenty-two
white leko lights formed a network
of beams that entangled the visual
while the rhythms wrestled with the
mind. Ray Barrere started to bend
the strings on his electronic six
string to get them on their feet and

running into “Rock and Roll
Doctor." Sam Clayton on conga
drums did duty by adding

enervating growls. The per-
formance brought the roar of a
congratulatory standing ovation at
the conclusion of only the fifth song
of the evening.

A harmonized warfare of guitar
eminated during “Apolitical
Blues," as Barrere and George
faced off at center stage. Narrowing
in one tone, when they hit it, it
penetrated the skin and struck a
nerve.

“Old Folks Boogie” brought the
band to its feverish height. Hall was
hopping, George was jumping and
Barrere was bouncing as the crowd
went crazy. The stage darkened
into blackness pierced only by the
glow of the orange power lights on
the ampliﬁers. A new grid of
lighting struck the stage for "Dixie
Chicken." The band was cooking; a
jarring solo by Ken Gradney on bass
bounced the pop-corn in the
concession stand. Richey Hayward
on drums beat the rhythms into
oblivion, and George was so hot on
guitar that an ashtray on stage
caught fire.

(Continued on Page 8)

Bill Payne of Little Feat made the group’s Wednesday night appearance in
Pittsburgh something special.

Linda Johnson Prime Pick from “The Apple Tree”

By JIM LEWIS

Pill News Stalitwrilcr
The Apple Tree
Directed by Alexander Gray

Linda Johnson is “The Apple
Tree,” the current offering at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse. She sings,
dances and acts well enough to
help director Alexander Gray and
the Point Park players overcome a
structurally difficult play.

Johnson, who has appeared in
Camelot Productions’ “Carousel"

(as Julie Jordan). “Camelot" (as
Guinevere) and “My Fair Lady"
(as Eliza Doolittle), is the center of
attraction in the three—vignette
work concerning the follies of
teniptation——as Eve. in Act l's
“The Diary of Adam and Eve," as
Princess Barbara, in Act lI’s “The
Lady or the Tiger,” and as
Passionella. in Act III's “Passion-
e-lla."
She
childish

portrays Eve with the
innocence the role de-

mands, aiding Leland Gantt (as
Adam) in pulling together a series
of blackout burlesques satirizing
the naming of animals (“Why do
you call that a horse?” Adam asks.
“Because it LOOKS like a horse,"
Eve explains) and the origin of the
traditional husband/wife chores
(cutting the grass, prettying up the
house).

But despite Johnson's and
Gantt’s energy, the clever script
still lacks direction. At times, the

first act is too clever and contains
too much burlesque——thus miring
the theme of falling into temptation
and its adverse effects deeper and
deeper, until it is forgotten.
Production-wise, Act I is a night-
mare. The blackout—burlesque
style calls for scenery changes,
which calls for limited and simple
scenery, which calls for much
pantoniiming (as opposed to
acting) by the cast. which results in
a fairy tale type of appearance the

play would have been better off
avoiding.

Act II, “The Lady or the Tiger,’
is not only a statement on tempta-
tion, but a parody on Roman
tragedy as well.

The entire cast joins in for this
act (as opposed to the three-person
performance in Act I) and picks up
the comedy and music——which
begins to lag at the end of the first
story.

Schneider a Hit, but F aleon’s Rose is Wilted

listener with soothing love songs,
and reflects a woman with a
purpose.

Side one contains “Until Now,’
in which an inspired Schneider
sings out that nobody heard the
words she was singing...until now.

Schneider does not write her own
words but as she explained. “I "like
to sing songs I would like to have
written, because when I decide to
sing a song, it becomes mine."

Billy Falcon’s new album needs more polishing.

A background orchestra fills in
where Schneider doesn't. “Love
Me” and “Every Step of the Way”
may strikingly associate Schneider
with such celebrated company as
Barbra Streisand.

Sensuous vocals
“Loneliness," a tranquil and
moving love song. As her
whispering voice cracks, the
emotion shines through. It makes
us glad that Schneider discovered
her singing talents while studying
classical piano during high school.
She declined a scholarship to
Julliard to concentrate on rock with
her vocal coach.

Schneider's style turns toward
Bette Midler in two selections. In a
more animated tune, “The Valen-
tino Tango, " Schneider pleads with
Mr. Valentino to teach her to
tango. Also, in “Rock Me and
Caress Me” as a straight blues
tune, the majority of accompany-
ment is piano and‘ a jazzy
saxophone.

But, whether one would rather
compare Schneider to Streisand or
Midler, she definitely has develop-
ed her own style and as the title
hopes for, it is now.

Amazing Kreskin Mystifies PittAudience

The Amazing Kvroskin made his fifth appearance at Pitt this week and mystified ,

students with his feats.

  Pentotholon
Seeks To Aid

Through Program

Some time this week, you
may hear a knock on your door
and discover a student asking
for sponsors or participants in
the upcoming Pentathalon.

On Saturday, from noon until
six, students will compete in
ﬁve events, some taken from
the “Guiness Book of World
Records,” in the large gym at
Trees Hall.

The purpose of the Penthath-
lon is twofold: to raise money
for World Vision, Inc., an
organization that provides
relief for the world’s hungry
people, and to raise students’
consciousness about hunger
problems.

“Two-thirds of the world’s
population is poor. Since, as
college students, we should be
aware of the overall world
situation, we should have an
interest in the welfare of the
poor,” said publicity coordina-
tor Bernie Alimonti. “By
participating in the Pentatha-
lon, we can help the poor and
have some fun doing it.”

amazing act of ESP and thought

Kreskin, who has made more

the audience. After the owners
veriﬁed the rings were rightly
linked, he released the strange
bond with a tap of his ﬁngers. ‘

Kreskin then played his favorite
card game. With his back to two
students, each holding eight cards,
he identiﬁed seven from each hand.

“I am not a psychic,” Kreskin
said. “Everything I do is
accomplished by perfectly natural
and scientiﬁc means. I won’t say I
understand everything I do. I don’t
call myself a mindreader.”

Kreskin, whose worldwide syn-
dicated show, “The Amazing World
of Kreskin,” is scheduled to return
to this country, has made a standing
offer of $20,000 to anyone who can
successful1y.disprove his claim that
he uses no confederate or secret
assistance of any kind.

At one point in the show, the
crowd was asked to jot down
thoughts, and deposit them into
envelopes distributed throughout
the room. Kreskin proceeded to
read some of those thoughts,
successfully guessing birthdays,
boyfriends, addresses and tele-
phone numbers.

As in past performances at Pitt,
Kreskin left the stage while

Hugh Rose is perfect as the
Balladeer, a cunningly knowledge-
able narrator who appears in Act III

Richard Burton on Broadway in

Johnson, as princess Barbara,
lays on the parody with “I’ve Got
What You Want,” a ritzy bur-
lesque that turns the Roman
tragedy into a laughable object.
Johnson joins Gantt in the king’s

ﬂashy tango.

Acting-wise, the third act is of
the lowest quality. ‘ ‘Passionella, ’ ’

auditorium, which was so crowed
the aisles had to be cleared on
several occasions. He agreed to
forfeit the check if he failed to locate
it. Kreskin returned, and found the
check, hidden in a spectator’s
baseball cap, within ﬁve minutes.

After a brief intermission,
Kreskin lectured against the
concept of hypnotism and “mind
control," and taught a lesson in the
power of suggestion, terming it
“mind distraction.”

“People will respond to any type
of suggestion, ” he said. “The focus
is imagination—wi1lingness and

suggestion is always temporary—.it

To cap off the evening, Kreskin
used the services of some 25

from sparrows to penguins—in the
palm of their hands.

Sensitivity Big Port of
Routine, Says Kreskin

By_NAN CY J. WINTNER

It was 75 degrees in Pittsburgh when “The Amazing Kreskin,”
internationally famed mentalist, strolled off his airplane Tuesday—but

The performer, who has had more than 170 performances on “The
Mike Douglas Show” and “The Tonight Show,” is the ﬁrst to admit that
he is not a psychic, a hypnotist, or a mind-reader.

“I never wanted to imply I had any supernatural powers,” Kreskin
said during the cab ride to Pitt.
‘Mentalist’ is a show business term that I use to dramatize my abilities.
But a more scientiﬁc and better term than Dr. Margaret Mead used to

“I cannot fortell the future.

Kreskin said that what he does is “inherent in everyone” and that
what he has learned to do is to sensitize himself to the “reactions and

“Over the last eight years I’ve realized that some of my techniques
can be used by most people if only they would devote time to applying
them. You could do almost anything better if you spend 15 minutes a day
applying yourself to it—-that’s a comrnittment. -But I donjt want to
mislead anyone. Just reading my book, “Mind Power,” is not going to
make you a mentalist or a Kreskin. That is just a lifestyle, a career—and
that’s what I’ve committed myself to——my career.”

Kreskin said, the key to learning these techniques or special abilities
is a person’s willingness to concentrate.

“The person who says ‘Gee, I don’t study as well as I should because I
don’t know how to concentrate’ is only kidding himself,” Kreskin
continued. “That person has built up a compartmentalized amnesia. I i
bet when he watches a rock concert or a movie, he is so wrapped up he
doesn’t notice or hear anything around him. He has learned to envelope
himself in something. Now the key is to be able to shift this ability (of

Although Kreskin uses intense concentration in all of his
performances to the point where he loses three pounds per show, the
mentalist will have to utilize his abilities even more when he participates
in a challenging feat next month in Canada. Atop one of "the highest
towers in the world, Kreskin will attempt to perceive the thoughts of a
celebrity who will be inside a helicopter hovering 100 feet above the

As of right now, Kreskin does not know who the celebrity will be, but
The feat will be taped for his
internationally syndicated program, ‘ ‘The Amazing World of Kreskin,’ ’

Many skeptics feel that Kreskin utilizes hypnosis in his performances,
but the mentalist denies this, offering $25,000 to anyone who can prove _’

under scientiﬁc conditions the existence of a speciﬁc hypnotic trance,

“Let any scientist come forth and prove that hypnosis exists,” he
emphasized. “I don’t believe there is any altered state of consciousness

that we can call hypnosis. T.S. Barber, who has done over 100 projects

Although Kreskin is predominantly recognized as a performer, he
also works with witnesses to crimes who may have seen important

worked with detectives on a rape case of a 10-year-old girl.

“By working with the imagination of one witness, one girl was able to
re-experience her feelings. She even saw a license plate pop into her
mind.”

But it’s not only rewards and excitement that are associated with a

Although Pitt pitcher Don Koller
doesn’t fancy himself as a strikeout
artist, those who saw him pitch
Sunday against Carnegie-Mellon
would be inclined to think
otherwise.

Koller, who claims he doesn’t
have “the big strikeout pitch,”
fanned 13 Tartan batters on his way
to an 8-1 win at Trees Field. In
whifﬁng 13, the sophomore from
Thomas Jefferson High School
exceeded his strikeout total (10) of
last season, when he saw spot duty
as a reliever.

The victory was the first in a
doubleheader sweep for the Pan-
thefs (2-1)- They also won the

 

SPORTS

second game behind the three-hit
pitching of freshman Mike Luchiow.

“I don’t have the overpowering
fast ball,” Koller said. “Since I’m
so small (5-9, 170), I have to rely
more on ﬁnesse than power, my
curveball more than my fastball.
My style of pitching doesn’t lead to
too many strikeouts. -

“Sunday, the ball must have
been really moving for me,” he
continued. “My curve must have
been especially good. Iwas getting
the strikeout.”

It was Kol1er’s ﬁrst start of the

Panthertte Leslie Palmer performs her speciality—1OO ‘meter’ hurdles.

season and his second ever at Pitt.
Other than a late-season start
against Penn State, Koller pitched
exclusively in relief last season.

He stepped into the starting
rotation when three of last ,year’s
starters graduated.

“It felt good starting,” the
sophomore said. “I felt like I was
really in the game.

“I didn’t like the idea of cleaning
up other people’s messes all the
time,” said Koller. “That was what
I was basically doing as a relief
pitcher.”

Friday, April 7, 1978—THE PITT NEWS—Page 11

Koller didn’t have any problems
with Sunday’s miserable cold and
damp weather. He was accustomed
to pitching in conditions similar to
the rain and hail that pelted Trees
Field Sunday.

“We played in weather like that
an awful lot in high school,” he
said. “I’d rather have warm
weather, but who wouldn’t.
There’s nothing you can do about
the weather. It’s never going to be
perfect during the season.”

As impressive as Sunday’s start
was for Koller, it wasn’t the most
impressive in his career. Two years
ago, the pitcher, then a high school
senior, opened the season by
tossing a no-hitter. Sunday, Koller

Don Kol|er’s Season Debut an Artistic Success for Pitt

didn’t allow a hit until the fourth
inning. He gave up three hits while
walking four in the game.

“I guess I’m the type of pitcher
who just starts the season off on the
right foot,” he said. “I’m happy
I’m that way. It gets my momentum
going for the rest of the season if I
have a good game in my first one or
two starts.”

Koller is expected to start again
either Friday at Robert Morris or
Saturday in a doubleheader with
Kent State at Trees Field.

What does he plan to do for an
encore?

“Improve,” the pitcher said. “I
threw too many pitches (105) last
week. I should be throwing only
about 80 a game.”

Murray’ s victory in the 100-meter
dash, posted with a time of 11.9‘

Mitchell to win the mile relay,
giving the Pantherettes 15 different

second to Murray in» the dash.
Michelle Bressant and Sue Lewis
took second and third in the hurdles
for the Pantherettes.

Sciullo, Bressant, Pam Shaw and
Mitchell set a new Pitt record with a
time of 51 .0 seconds in winning the
race by 90 yards.

Barb Billek edged teammate
Maria Sciullo at the wire of the
400-meter hurdles. Chorpenning,
who along with Janet Wilk and
Carol Gober, ﬁnished one-two-

three for Pitt in the 800 meters, also
won the 1,500 meters by a large
margin with Therese Walton taking
second.

Sue Lewis, after ﬁnishing third in
the .100-meter hurdles, came back to
capture the 220-yard dash, and
Louise Carlson won the 440-yard
run. Pitt’s Pam Gearing took second

0 in each of the events, as well as

placing in the high jump.

Marie. Ribik, also expected to
qualify for the national champion-
ship ‘meet sometime during the
year, was victorious in the high
jump while Pantherette teammate
Kim Green won the long jump. In
the Pantherettes’ other ﬁeld event
victory, Carmen Scherich took ﬁrst
place in the javelin.

-Coach Alfreeda Goff explained
that the meet was to help the women
get ready for the season and that, at
this stage at least, records and
qualifying times are not that
important.

PANTHERETTE PRINTS: Pitt
will join Ohio State, Kent State and
“host” Penn State in Saturday's
Invitational. The Lady Lions are the
technical hosts, but because of
construction on Beaver Stadium,
have moved the meet to Kent
State...Slippery Rock, after being
blasted by the Pantherettes in-
doors, has excluded certain events
from its upcoming outdoor meet
with Pitt...The events eliminated
certainly were not Pantherette
weaknesses.

Panther Swimmer Catinchi Confident, of Cup Triumphs

By KAREN KADILAK
_ Pin News Staff writer
Orlando Catinchi, who this past
winter helped lead Pitt’s swim team
to its ﬁrst undefeated dual-meet

season since 1948, is now compet-
g in the Latin Cup swimming

championships in San Juan, P.R.

The junior from San Juan is
representing Puerto Rico in the
100- and 200-meter breastroke and
400-meter medley relay during the

three-day competition.

The annual meet, which pits the
top swimmers from Latin America,
Spain, Italy and France, started
yesterday, and continues through
tomorrow at the outdoor pool at the

Qﬁiversity of Puerto Rico.

Twelve countries are competing,
with the best swimmers from each
competing in every event. Partici-
pants were chosen on the basis of

theirtimes during the year.

It will be Catinchi’s first
appearance in the meet. Although
he also qualiﬁed in 1976 and 1977,
the junior instead opted to swim for
Pitt in the NCAA championships,
which were being held the same
weekend.

‘‘I have always wanted to go,”
Catinchi said before leaving for San
Juan earlier this week. “It is always
a good meet with the toughest of
competition.

“It’s different than most meets in
that there’s only one race in every
event to determine the champion,”
Catinchi continued. “There are no
preliminaries or ﬁnals. You have to
do well in that one race, or you don’t
have any chance to be champion.”

Unlike short-course (measured in
yards) collegiate events, the Latin
Cup consists of long-course (meas-
ured in meters) distances. Catinchi

hasn’t swum long course since ,

1976, when he ﬁnished 17th in the

200-meter breastroke at the Mon-
treal Olympics.
Before leaving for San Juan

ORLANDO CATINCHI

Wednesday, Catinchi practiced ‘

long-course distances at Pitt’s
Trees Pool- _What he couldn’t
simulate was the sweltering heat

Puerto Rico is expected to have’

during the competition.

“It’s going to be extremely hot
down there,” Catinchi said.

“Swimming under the sun, you
have a tendency to get tired faster.
When I get to Puerto Rico, I hope to
practice my long-course ‘events in
the sun.”

Three other collegiate swimmers

I are also competing for Puerto Rico.

Femaldo Canales (Michigan), Ar-
naldo Perez (North Carolina) and
Carlos Berracol (Alabama), who

ﬁnished fourth in the 200-meter,

backstroke at the 1976 Olympics,

will swim with Catinchi in the
400-meter medley relay.
~It will be their ﬁrst time

competing in the meet, as well. Like
Catinchi, all three qualiﬁed in 1976

and 1977, before deciding to
compete in the NCAA champion-
ships.

With himself, Canales,
and Berracol swimming, Puerto
Rico, Catinchi maintained, should
challenge defending champion
Brazil for the team championship.

‘ ‘We will be in there all the way, ’ ’
.he said. “With the type of
swimmers we've added this year,
we should do very well, in fact.”

SWIM SHORTS: Catinchi swam
breastroke on the 400-yard medley
relay team that ﬁnished 17th in the
recent NCAA Swimming and Diving
Championships in Long Beach,
Calif. ‘

Pitt women’s diver Cindy
Ferraro competed in the AAU
National Diving Championships at
Harvard University in Cambridge,
Mass. last weekend. Ferraro, a
sophomore from the Boston area,

Optimistic Tanner Convinced Pirates Will Win

By The Associated Press

Pittsburgh Pirate manager Chuck
Tanner, the perpetual “Mr. Opti-
mism,” has a smile frozen on his
face trying to convince the world
that Pittsburgh will win the National
League East this season.

Tanner is still selling his lumber
and lightening philosophy, despite
dispatching a big piece of lumber—
outﬁelder Al Oliver—to Texas for
pitcher Bert Blyleven.

The Pirates do have a lot of talent,
but they have a number of question
marks:

—-Can Omar Moreno, a .240
hitter, replace Oliver, one of the top
10 hitters in the league?

—How long will it take second
baseman Rennie Stennett to recover
fully from the severe leg fracture he

suffered last August? Stennett still
had a slight limp in spring training.
The infielder expressed some
concem about his batting style
needing a change, noting he was
bailing out too much. I
-Can Kent Tekulve, Grant Jack-
son and Jim Bibby among them
replace r/elievers Rich Gossage and

Terry Foerster, especially the
Cannonball-throwing Gossage, who
saved 26 games last season.
—How about middle relievers to
replace Tekulve and Jackson? _,
—Also, first baseman Willie

Stargell has turned 37. How much

has the big guy left? He’s been
injury prone the past few years.

Tanner answered all these
questions by saying the Pirates won
96 games last season with a total of
81 players hurt at one time or
another, causing them to miss a
game or games.

Mr. Optimism ﬁgures there is no
way that will happen again, and that
a healthy bunch of Pirates can make
up the ﬁve-game difference be-
tween them and the defending
champion Philadelphia Phillies.

The Pirates do have a lot of
plusses. Their pitching is stronger
with the addition of Blyleven and
Bibby. Tanner can muster a solid
starting. core of 20-game winner
John Candelaria, Jerry Reuss,
Blyleven and Jim Rooker, who is
coming back from breaking his
non-throwing arm.

Bruce Kison and 20-year-old
rookie Don Robinson can relieve or
start, giving the Pirates even more
strength.

If Stargell and Stennett can play I

to their potential, Tanner has a good

inﬁeld, with Frank Taveras at
shortstop and Phil Garner at third.
Mario Mendoza and Fernando
Gonzalez will be the backup
inﬁelders.

The rest of the outfield, in
addition to Moreno, appears to be

' -.~. .vs.«.~.-. .

RENNIE STENNETT

solid. In rightﬁeld, Tanner may
have the best player in baseball in
hulking Dave Parker, the 1977
National League batting champion,
and he has clutch-hitting Bill
Robinson in left. Robinson also can
play third or ﬁrst, if needed.

Parker, who came to spring
training about 20 pounds under-
weight and convinced he is
underpaid, is a young Roberto
Clemente. He can throw hard and
accurately, catches anything close
enough to grab and hits often and
with power. Robinson hit .304 and
drove in 104 runs in 1977.

The catching is adequate. The
recent return of Manny Sanguillen
should bolster the crew, which
includes Duffy Dyer, a fine
defensive catcher who scares no one
with his bat. Young Ed Ott, still
learning the mechanics of catching,
hit .264 last year and should
improve on that ﬁgure.

Despite Mr. Optimism and his
ever-smiling countenance, the Pi-
rates appear to be the second best to
the Phillies for the third straight
year. But they have the potential to
win it all.

Gymnasts Leam from Los

By SUE McFARLAND
V Pitt News Staff Writer

For Pitt gymnasts Myra Bachu-
chin and Bonnie Tressler, this past
weekend at the AIAW National
Championships in Seattle can be
chalked up to experience, as they
failed to qualify for the ﬁnals by a
narrow margin.

“I’ve been in national competi-
tion before (the 1977 Senior
Nationals in Tempe, Ariz.), but this
was a different type of pressure,”
Bachuchin said. “This time I
wasn’t competing just for myself,
but for the team and the school.”

Bachuchin said that before the
meet she set a goal of qualifying for
the ﬁnal day of the two-day
competition held at the University
of Washington, and almost did so
in the vault, coming up one-tenth of
a point short.

“I wasn’t really pleased with my
performance,” Bachuchin said,
“but I had a great time watching
the other competitors.”

Bachuchin said she hopes the
entire team will qualify for next
year’s Nationals to be held at Penn
State.

“We could really use the fan
support when we’re that close to
home," the freshman from Mones-
son said. »

Tressler, a member of the
all-East team picked at the Eastern
Regionals held in March at Pitt,
tied Bachuchin in the ﬁrst-day
all-around competition with a score
of 33.55.

“I wasn’t happy at all with the
way I performed,” Tressler said.
“I had breaks on just about every
event; I guess it was from nerves.”

Tressler echoed Bachuchin’s
sentiments on the difference be-
tween this national championship

and others in which she has
competed.
“The others were all so

individual,” she said, “but I knew I
was working for the team.”

“I really learned a lot 111
Seattle.” Tressler added. “I picked
up some new ideas for routines for
next year, and it was nice to see
competitors from outside of our
region.”

Penn State’s Ann Carr swept
virtually every individual award at
the Championships for the second
consecutive year, becoming the
first women gymnast to do so. Penn
State also clinched the team title as
was expected by Pitt head coach
Donna DeMarino.

“Penn State is the best college
team I have seen all year,” said
DeMarino.

DeMarino was pleased with the
performances of the Pantherettes
at the team’s initial national
collegiate competition.

“I would have really liked to
have seen the entire team there,
because individual performers tend
to get lost in the shuffle at this type
of meet.” DeMarino said.

DeMarino also said four teams at
the competition scored lower than
Pitt, but, because of the selection
process, were permitted to enter
the meet. Only the winners of each
of the nine regional competitions
and the next 10 highest team scores
are invited to participate in the
national championship.

“There were teams there that} t ~‘

scored 134, while Pitt scored 137 at "
our Eastern Regionals,” DeMarino
said.

‘V The fourth-year headicoach said

Pitt S. U.

‘K

‘K there are plans to possibly change

«k the selection process that has

* recently come under fire from
many AIAW coaches.

“We all learned a lot from the
meet, said DeMarino. “It helped us

when we will have a much better

f nationals.” y ‘
