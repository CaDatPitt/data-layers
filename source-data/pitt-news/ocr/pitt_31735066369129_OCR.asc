FormeriCounci I Member Claims Chance for

By SUE McFARLAND

A _Pitt graduate" assistant
charged last week that the Pitt
Union Program Council ignored a
chance toschedule Roy Ayers, a
black jazz-soul musician for the
annual BAS Black Week Concert.

P_aul Carosi, a graduate assistant
in the School of Library and
Information Sciences and former
member of the program council
music committee said beforehis
resignation from the committee
that Allen Ramer, an agent
representing Ayers, phoned, him to

tell him that his client was available '

for the Black Week concert lonthe
datethat BAS designated.
Carosi said he gave Ramer the

number of BAS advisor Sarah.’

Brown and the BAS ofﬁce because

A to their ﬁnal approval. “All they

had to do was call Ramer back but
they couldn’t even do that,” Mark
Holloway, Chairman of the Black
Action Society, said. “The—Ayers
concert just. showed how PUPC has
failed in representing Pitt’s black
population. ’ ’

‘woman, "Steve Vance,

According to Carosi, the concert
was approved by BAS and was then
up to theprogram council leaders
(Tammy Haddad, General chair-
' music
committee chairman and Jack
Brown,‘ advisor to the council) to

contact Ramer to ﬁnalize the

agreement.

Carosi said that he was told by
Haddad and Vance not to return
the call to Ramer. to finalize the
contract. A week later Ramer
closed a booking with DiCeasare
Engler Productions to have Ayers
perform at the Stanley Theater on
Nov. 25. ~ - '

Carosi made theseallegations in 

a letter he drafted to Student
Government President Josh Bayl-
son. -

“Every day I.would pick up the
paper and read criticism from the
BAS. They had every right to
criticize’ PUPC. They were placing
the blame on the structure of PUPC

Dr. Jose Moreno, a sociology
professor here, said yesterday that

about 3,000 political prisoners in
Cuban jails and to make travel
improve
relations between Cubans abroad
and the Cuban government.

Moreno, one of 75 Cuban
professors,_ businessmen and
churchmen to meet with Castro last

' week, said the more liberal travel

restrictions and the planned

release of the prisoners would help

to end the long-standing grievance

over political prisoners that has

existed within the Cuban communi-

ties in the United States and other

countries. , -

After the conference Nov. 20 and

Nov. 21, Castro announced a three’
point plan to the 75 delegates who

attempted to do in the case of the
Ayers concert.‘. '- » . . . a

“With the Ayers concert we
would have been forced to do. our
own show, and we didn’t want to do
‘this,”- Vance said. °

When asked why the program
council would produce a show for
the Chuck Mangione concert and

not for the Ayers concert, Vance
said that they were assured of
ﬁnancial success with Mangione,
. but not with Ayers."

Vance said that ’ he was also
under the impression that Ayers
was not available for the speciﬁed

' date because" he had already been

booked by DiCeasare Engler .'for—
. Nov. 25. ‘

According " to Ramer, an -effort
was made by the program council
to provide Ayers for the Black
‘Week Concert. - -

“I really believe that an honest
effort was made to bring Ayers to
Pittsburgh through the Univer-
sity,” Ramer said. “But the deal
was never closed so we were forced
to make a move and go with

‘afraid of-bad publicity if similar

demonstrations occurred here.

Castro also ‘announced that he

“We can do our own concerts at
Pitt. Pittsburgh is the third largest

away from the Mickey Mouse

Terry Milani, associate director

who is serving as director of the

hoped that the public would place
less emphasis on the past mistakes
of the program council and look at
what is being done about the future
of the organization. He also said

not place the blame for the
program council problems on any
individual, or on the members’ lack
of training as Carosi accused.

“There is a deﬁnite lack of
clarity within the organiiation, of

Resident Assistant Applications
Available from Residence Life  

By PATTY TASCARELLA
‘Pitt News Staff Writer

Applications for resident assist-
ant positions in the Pitt residence
halls for the 1979-1980 school year
will be available _Dec. 1 through
Jan. 11 in the Office of Residence
Life, according to Tim Snyder,
assistant director of the office. ,

Snyder said there will be 84
positions open for juniors, seniors
and graduate students--an incre-
ase of 8 positions from last year.
Past residence in the dormitories,
he said, is not a prerequisite for the
position, which provides the
resident assistant with room and
board in exchange for supervising a
floor in the residence halls. ,

“We rarely hirepeople who have

i _ not lived in a residence hall (not

necessarily at Pitt)—but it has
happened, Snyder said.‘ “We have

had RAs who've been married and ‘

divorced, athletes and people who
have been out of school for a few
years.” A
Snyder said diversity is a prime
factor in the two month selection

“We look for someone who is

value system he is comfortable
with,” Snyder said.‘

Snyder said a prospective resi-I

study has ‘nothing to do with
selection, adding that many people
assume the job is intentionally
geared for ‘social science majors.

admitted bonus but not a determin-
ing point, according to Snyder.

“I think what we try to .do in
those cases is look beyond
affiliation or title,” Snyder said.

admitted the closer Contact with the
Office ‘of Resident Life “doesn’t
hurt.” I H

The addition of juniors in the
positions last year has been
successful, Snyder said.‘

“I think they're working out
really well,’’ he said.. “They're
making‘ a real contribution to the
program.”

Snyder added that many colleges
use sophomores as resident assist-

ants but said “we’re able to be- :3
selective enough to choose people 

who are mature.” He said plans to

include sophomores in Pitt's :

programs are .being ‘considered for
futu-re‘years.- A - -

Snyder said 160 applications ,  I
' were ﬁled last year for 50 positions,

(the remaining 26 places were ﬁlled
by ‘returning resident assistants)
and he expects the number to
increase due to student uncertainty
with the new roomlottery system
and greater awareness of the
eligibility of juniors. ’

Professor Tells of Castro Plan to Free Prisoners

(Contirmedfrom page" I)
release only 50 to 60 percent of the
political prisoners who were part of
the Batista regime. According to
Moreno, Castro told delegates at
the conference there are 245
political prisoners in jail who are
part of that regime. Those guilty of
serious crimes such as torture
would not be released.

Moreno said there would also be
priorities set to judge who should
ﬁrst be allowed to leave Cuba to
join their families outside the

' country. He said that spouses and
close relatives probably would be‘-

given ﬁrst consideration.

Special exceptions would also be
given to Cubans who wished to visit
relatives in Cuba, according to
Moreno. He said that those with

sick or elderly relatives would be
given first consideration. Moreno
added that Cuba did not have
facilities to accept immediately all
the applicants who might want to
travel to Cuba under the new
provisions.

' Moreno said that the new
guidelines for release of political
prisoners and the emigration of
family members were much more
far-reaching than any other similar
measures taken by the Cuban
government. He cited Castro’s
allowing men of military age to
leave the country as proof of this.

“Members of family of miltary‘-

age will be allowed to leave. This
was never done before,” Moreno
said.

Moreno said he believed that this
thaw in Catro’s attitude toward the
Cuban community abroad was
caused by the recent visit of Cuban
youth from abroad to the largest
island of the Antilles.

“The Cuban government began
to realize that not all Cuban exiles
are counter-revolutionaries, ” Mor-
eno said.

A spokesman for the State
Department cited the different
words used in the past and now
evidence of the change in attitude
toward the Cuban community
abroad. In the past, Castro and the
Cuban government called the
exiles gusano (worm). Now Castro
said he will call the exiles el
communidad (the community).

A solution to the political
prisoner question is one of the
problems that the American

‘government has- said must be

solved before relations between the
U.S. and Cuba can be normalized.

During a press conference after
the meeting with Moreno and
others, Castro said the action to
release prisoners was unilateral
and intended only to better

relations with Cubans who live"

abroad. Both Moreno and State
Department officials declined to
speculate whether this action was
directly related to moves toward
better Cuban-American relations.

One of the only factors that could
stand in the way of the release of

e the prisoners is the ability of the

United States and other nations to

accept the prisoners as exi1es;‘\

However, this does not seem to be
a problem now.

Castro said he would release 400
prisoners per month, if the U.S.

State Department and Justice.‘

Department could review and
accept prisoners at that rate. The
Justice Department announced
yesterday they should be able to
evalute 400 prisoners per month.

Moreno has lived abroad since
before the Cuban revolution but
was never allowed to return until

he made two trips there in 1976 and«\_

1977. Many of the 75 delegates‘
were exiles, including one man who
was a minister in the Batista
regime.

  Proposal
  To Consider

The Student Government Assembly Council‘ heard
a novel proposal from government assembly member
Craig W. Yankes at its meeting yesterday. The
proposal, which suggests that a subcommittee be
formed to review the Pitt Union Program Council
seems to be the best of all proposals that have
attempted to deal with the problems of the council.

The subcommittee would study the council in
depth. Yankes’ white paper ‘lists four purposes that
the subcommittee would fulfill. First, the committee

' ' would recommend changes needed in the program
‘ , council to the assembly council, Student Government

Board, program council and the Office of Student

t  Activities.

It would also inform the student body on the cir-

’ cumstances surrounding the creation and operation
- , of the council, determine the legality of the contract
» between the government board and the Office’ of

Student Activities that founded the council and

 specify the relationship between the program council

To complete these tasks, the committee would hold
public meetings open to all students. During those
meetings, the committee members—five council
members, the two advisors and theichairwoman of
the program council, and two SGB members—would
hear the statements of interested persons about the
program council. The first meeting would be held
the week of Dec. 4 and subsequent meetings would be

scheduled if necessary. To ensure student input, the .

first meetingwould be advertised across the campus.
After the public meetings, a full report that included
legislative and judicial recommendations would be
written and presented to the assembly council,
program council, SGB and the Office of Student Ac-
tivities. ’ '
Yankes’ proposal seems to be a realistic one that
should be considered by students.
the assembly council was not able to act on the

motion because only three of the 13 members of the T

council appeared at the meeting and seven members
were needed for a quorum. '

Those who were concerned enough to attend the
meeting developed a solution to guarantee that
Yankes’ committee report would not die in the coun-
cil. Student Government Board member Stan Galan-
ski said that the subcommittee should become a task
forceof the SGB. He said he would make a motion
to that effect at the board meeting today.

If the board is sensible, it will approve Galanski’s
motion and move with all speed to set up a task for-
ce. The task force could then act to end the con-
troversy surrounding the program council that has
haunted the Student Union for the past several
weeks. . . . , ~ . .

The task force would combine well with the other
reforms that have been made. to make the council a"

Unfortunately, '

advisors to the council instead of one should ensure
that the council is under adequate control. An ad-
ditional study of the council ‘could help to clear the
questions about the council and allow the advisors to
worry about future programming and forget past
problems. ' .

If it is instituted, the task force should consider the

original suggestion made by Jan Medoff at a govern- '

ment assembly meeting several weeks ago.- That
proposal would allow the music committee to
schedule concerts without using a promoter, as they
are required to do now. -

A task force, when combined withethe change to

two advisors and the Medoff proposal, should put".‘*- V

the program council back on the right path and make

it more able to supply worthwhile concerts and events '

here. Hopefully, it will bring to an end the destruc-
tive .circle of charges and counter-charges that has
beseiged the program council during the last month. _

Preparing for theTricentenial - Today

By LARRY LUNSFORD

Plans for the nation’s bicenten-
nial celebration were in the making
for several years. There were large
celebrations and there were small
individual efforts. The “Spirit of
’76” was a period that official
bicentennial commissioners hoped
would bring the American people
back to peace with each other after
relations had been strained since
the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In different ways, people were
able to get involved in the

,r__celebrations—many domestic prob-
’ lems were forgotten or set aside.

There was a revival of the antique
craze as folks began to rummage
through their attics and garages to

find relics of the nation’s past.

It is interesting to note some of
the items that have been saved
from centuries ago.
telling of great tragedies—the
deaths of national personalities and
wars throughout the world—have
been kept through generations of

families, most often in family
Bibles.
Personal letters, deeds and,

most interestingly, receipts have
been saved and treasured for their
value to future _generations.
Rummaging through old trunks,
closets and attics turned up
memorabilia that not only provided
a family with its heritage but also
portrayed part of the nation’s

history. .
I The fact that the bicentennial

Newspapers »

is two years past and all but
forgotten makes one wonder what
items will be of historical interest in
July, 2076. Surely accounts of the
landing‘ of Viking I on Mars would
be appropriate. In fact, there may
well be tricentennial celebrations
on the planet itself. ,

There are other major news
accounts since 1976 whose banner
headlines may be of value during
the tricentennial. Pope John Paul
l’s death after just 34 days in ofﬁce
and the resulting election of the
first Polish Pope in the Church’s
history and the ﬁrst non-Italian
Pope’ in over 400 ye'ars'”are
headlines that would be worth

More Greek

I'm a sophomore at Pitt, and for
the last year and a half I’ve been
reading The Pitt News regularly.
The Pitt News is supposed to be a
student newspaper, written by the
students and read by the students.

ignore its readers’ wants?

the Pitt Union Program Council and
the Black Action Society should be.

One out of every ten students is a

Greeks do more than the Resident‘

program council for the surround-
ing community.

Compare blood drives, charity
drives, ‘and so forth. The
Inter-fraternity Council and Pan-

,7-.;.hellenic Association are the most -

powerful and largest on campus...
That is why they ask the Greeks
when they want a job done. . Since
school has started I have seen
absolutely no positive articles at all
in The Pitt News about the Greeks.

There are approximately 12
articles in'The Pitt News every
issue including letters to the editor.
If The Pitt News represents the
student body then why isn’t there a
single article week after week
about the Greeks? The students

_ who make up the Greeks are some
,_ of the most active on’ campus.

I joined the Delta Sigma Chi
fraternity a year ago. While I was
pledging, our fraternity collected
$8,200 for charity, won seven out of
15 trophies for’ Greek Week _and
there was not one article in The Pitt

doesn't The Pitt News do its job?
The students at Pitt want to know
about the Greeks. They’ want to

‘Outlaws at their best,

By HARRISON C. STACKPOLE

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Outlaws, the popular
Tampa, Fla.-based group, enter-
tained an enthusiastic Civic [Arena
crowd of approximately 9,000
people last Friday with a unique
brand of country rock.

The crowd came to see the
and the
six-man group, led by guitarists
Hughie Thomasson and Billy Jones
did not disappoint its _fans.
Following the opening" act of Nick
(“Hot Child In The City”) Guilder, '
the Outlaws came out to a
thunderous ovation and opened,
their two-hour performance with
“Hurry Sundown.”

Additional highlights of, the
evening included material from the

group’s latest release, “Playin’ To
Win.” The new material included

‘ “Take It Any_Way You Want It,”

“You Are the Show,” and “Dirty
City.” (featuring bassist Freddie
Salem on lead vocals). ,

The band also performed other
top Outlaw favorites, such as
“There Goes Another Love Song.”
The PM classic, “Green Grass and
High Tides Forever” (the 20-
minute version) served as the

Outlaws’ encore.

Other songs played by the group

included, “Free Born Man” and

' assorted songs from past_ Outlaws

albums—‘ ‘ Lady In Waiting, ’ ’
“Outlaws” and “Hurry Sun-
down.” -

The band’ was dynamic, as
expected. .Its unique, set—two

drummers, two bassists and two
guitarists—is perfect for the
Outlaws’ style of music, especially
in concert. Guitarists (and lead
vocalists) Jones and Thomasson
displayed tremendous coordina-
tion, while the beat elements
(Freddie Salem and Harvey Dalton
Arnold on bass and Monte Yoho ‘
and David Dix on percussion) gave
the band the country rock ﬂavor
that has made the Outlaws one of
the most popular groups of its kind
in the country.

Originally, opening acts for the
concert were to be Nick Guilder,
along with Cleveland’s Michael
Stanley Band. Illness, however,
kept the Michael ‘Stanley Band
from appearing. '

The new Outlaws album,
“Playin’ To Win,” answers the
question or whether or not the
Outlaws have changed their style
from heavy country rock ’n’ roll.
The answer, Outlaw fans will be
happy to hear, is an out and out
“No way.” ,

“Playin’ To Win” is another hit
album in a long line of hit albums
that Outlaws producer John
“Mutt” Lange has meshed to-
gether with Hughie Thomasson
and Company from the group’s
recording ‘studio in Atlanta. The
tempo of the album is set up well
'by the first cut, “Take It Any Way
You Want It,” which is a heavy

bass Thomasson tune that has the

form of other great Outlaws songs-

like “Green Grass and High Tides
Forever.” As soon as that song is
ended the album (just like the
concert on Friday night) slams into
“Cry Some More,” a’ song that
does not quite match the_intensity
of the prior tune, but lacks nothing
in terms of the beat and quality of
the music. ‘
Another excellent tune is
Thomasson song entitled, “You are
The Show,” a smooth wailing
guitar ‘song with a deep bass
background that features the
high-pitched vocals of Billy Jones,"
adding depth to the song. i
The Outlaws, through the
talented innovations of guitarists

Outlaws Win in New Release

Jones and Thomasson and bassists
Freddie Salem and Harvey Dalton
Arnold, have also developed what
could be termed as a “tender”
Outlaws style; elements of this can
be heard in some of the other songs
in “Playin’ To Win” such as “A
Real Good Feeling” (a song that
again features the vocal talents of
Jones) and -“If Dreams Came
True.” -

“Playin’ To Win” is an album
that shows a fair amount of
potential and could be a welcome
addition to any rock album

"collection. So, all you Outlaw fans,

don't despair. The Outlaws
haven't changed their style,
they've-just reﬁned it a bit, and the
change is all for the better.

Guilder did appear. Aside from
being inappropriate for the occa- _
sion and unwanted by the crowd,
Guilder’s performance most can-
didly could be described as Top
40-teen idol nonsense. a
Pittsburgh music fans can- be
impressed with the crowd’s letting

Guilder know the quality of his .

performance by pelting Guilder
and his- band with garbage,
curtailing his poor performance.

JaZZ GuitaristKarsh -- "l'm Not a Purist” s  

By PHILIP CONTES

“I was trying to learn how to

switch chords fast,” Kenny Karsh

said. “I was very frustrated and
decided one day that if I didn’t
switch properly on that day, I
wouldn't pick up the guitar again.

sored by “Backspace."

Pltteburgh jazz gultarlst Kenny Karsh gave a concerts! Pm last week spon-

'Well, that day I switched proper-
ly.” -

That day was 10, years ago.
Today, at 20, Karsh is one of the
area’s top jazz guitarists.

His first teacher interested him
in jazz by introducing him to the

    

 

styles of guitarists Johnny Smith
and Pat Martino. At 12 he sat in
with Bobby Negri’s band. Later at
age 16 he would play with the Pitt
Jazz Ensemble, while auditing
Nathan Davis’ inprovisation
courses. At 17 he played backup
for'Rod McKuen in an area concert.
After graduating from high school,

School of Music in Boston,
studying under Mike Gibb and
Alex Rudelesco. »

For the past year, Kenny has
been back in Pittsburgh playing at
many of the localclubs, such as the
Encore, Tender Trap, Top Shelf,
Stage Door and Antoninos, where
he was the opening act for his
guitar idol, Pat Martino. He
studied composition under Eric
Kloss for about six months. Plans
are. now under way for Kloss’ new
album, on which «Karsh will appear.

. Karsh says he enjoys playing in

the Pittsburgh jazz clubs and
respects area musicians. He
remembers one particularly good
night at the Top Shelf.

“It was with Virgil Walters on
bass, Roger Humphreyson drums,
Eric Kloss on sax and myself.
There was a creative spark between
us, and we all seemed to enjoy
elaborating on it. We were so
good, I called my parents and told
them to come down.‘ We had
so much fun on stage I would’ve
walked out of there without getting
paid.”

Karsh’s musical stylepis varied.
He counts Martino, Kenny Burrell
and Pat Metheny as his major
inﬂuences. “I’m not a purist,” he

Karsh spent a year at the Berkely _

« adds. “I hold the Beatles and
Hendrix in as much admiration as
John McLaughlin.”

Karsh has a wide repertoire of
songs, ranging from the jazz
classics to ‘Chic Corea, from the
Beatles to Benson, plus a number
of his own compositions.

“Generally, if I like something I
try‘ to learn it,” he said. “There’s a
song off of Billy Joel’s new album
called “Rosalinda’s Eyes” which
I’m trying to work out now.”

Karsh said he enjoys writing

' music and explains that he usually

starts with» a melody and builds
from there. “One of the greatest
thrills for me is to sit back .and
listen to someone else play
something I've written. ’ "
Karsh said he hopes to move to
New York to further his musical
career. “In about ‘five years I’ll

hopeto be in my own band doing
my own stuff.”

uncle, Bilbo Baggins. The ring was

Heinz Hall was the site of one of
the year’s finest jazz performances
as Maynard Ferguson, who was
presented to the audience as,
“the finest trumpet player in the
world,” performed in front of a
near-capacity audience Sunday
night.

The enthusiastic Ferguson was
accompanied by a 13-piece orches-
tra and his own" personal musical
arsenal of three horns, of which two

are custom built for Ferguson: a
ﬂugelhorn, the M.F. Horn and the
M.F. Firebird. The reason that
Ferguson uses such specialized
equipment is twofold; no one plays
the trumpet quite like Ferguson,
and Ferguson’s music is high-
lighted by the high notes achieved
by these special instruments. .
Following the introduction and a

‘short warm-up, Ferguson. opened
.up the ﬁrst part of a two part

program with an original tune
entitled “Give It One,” which

featured the alto sax work of Mike
Migliore and former Blood, Sweat
and Tears member Bobby Columby
on the drums. From there, the
orchestra played “Birdland” (a
song made popular by the jazz

improvisation group Weather’

Report) that featured solos by Eric
Trau_b on the tenor sax, Louie Karfa
on bass, John Chubina on electric
guitar-and Ferguson on M.F. Horn.
Next, the theme from “Battle-
_ star Galactica” was played with the
kevboard work of 19-year-old_ Jay

 'Lordot the Rings 'Disappoints

Garthwaite has a dynamic voice.
On the livelier tunes, like her
upbeat version of Van Morrison’s
“Moondance,”, it comes across
throaty and just slightly raspy. It
often has a nice nasal twang, like
that of Phoebe Snow. On “You’re
Fine,” ‘-‘Here Today”- and “Some
Other Spring,” three soft ballads,
it turns surprisingly clear. She
recalls Billie Holiday's unique
' sound on “What’s the Matter With

cut, “Ticket to Chicago” and
“Happiness” adds a lively touch of
island rhythm.

Following an ‘introduction of the

' rest of the entourage, Ferguson

played the title cut from his latest
release, “Camival.” Guitarist
Chubina dazzled-the audience with
his acoustic guitar work that
opened the many-tempoed song
(Ferguson accompanied him on the
solo with the ﬂugelhorn). The
song, which took approximately 25
minutes to play, covered the entire
realm of the band’s talents and
displayed a fascinating tandem
drum solo by Columby and
Guiseppe Mazzello (who also
played trumpet and other assorted
percussion instruments such as the
gong and bongos). The most
amazing highlight of the entire
musical episode was a scene in
which every member of the band’s
horn section was playing some
primitive musical instrument and
creating an unbelievable melody.

Following that, the band took at

ﬁfteen minute break. Upon their
retum,' they opened) with Fer-

guson’s’ most popular song, the‘

theme from “Rocky” (“Gonna Fly
Now”). Then came “Stella By

Ferguson displayed his orchestra’s
diversity by playing an aria from

Afterwards, Ferguson a featured ‘
his outstanding trumpet section of’ -

Mazzello, Stan Mark (from Leba-
non, Pa.), Dan Weltie and Dan
Barber. Each member displayed
awesome abilities with the horn,

but it was clear that Ferguson, who _

followed them, was the master of
the trumpet as he reached notes

with the trumpet that some.

musicians only dream about
playing.

As an encore, the orchestra went

‘into a “Christmas Medley” that
covered all of the popular Christ--I

rendition of “Silent Night” by all of

Cagers Hope for a (Rio) Grande Opener Tonight 3 

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

This team has a ﬁne quarter-
back whose forte is defense and
who played center for a state
champion high school team.

Its center, meanwhile, has
emerged from an off-season of
weightlifting still resembling a
goalpost more than he does a
lineman.

Its best player possesses a build

‘ﬁne for one who plays defensive

during a game.

  Only Score Detracts

By JIM PANE

Pitt News Staff Writer
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.-

4 Nothing was going to detract from

the greatness of this game. Not the
trafﬁc jams to and from Beaver
Stadium. Not Joe Paterno’s pre-
game cleat crusade. Not the
blustery weather. Not even Gov.
Shapp’s presence in the press box.

Two teams, one apparently
outmatched by the other, were
displayed before ABC-TV cameras
and a local gathering of 77,465 to
settle the state, if not the national,
title. First there was Penn State,
whose undefeated and Sugar
Bowl-bound Lions have all of

W“

And its guards are quick and

. tough, but not one weighs 200

pounds.

Even Earl Campbell, Gordon
Jones and Matt Cavanaugh
couldn’t much help such a group on
the football field, but .Tim
Grgurich’s current litter of" Pan-
thers,‘ described above, ﬁgure to
fare well on basketball courts
across the east this season.

Pitt has lived—-and, at times,
died—with young players during
Grgurich’s three seasons as coach
here, but that painful past could
yield a fruitful 1978-79 season.
Nothing, save perhaps a standout
shooter, appears to be missing this
year.

The starting lineup is not
settled—one spot is open today,
and several changes should occur
as the season ~ages—but here
Grgurich faces not so much a
problem as a matter of selection.
He can choose from among seven
and perhaps 10 competent players.

Three Panthers,——Sam Clancy,
Wayne Williams and Terry
Knight-have secured starting
positions, but Ed Scheuermann will

Mount Nittany stirring in anticipa-
tion of the school's ﬁrst national

I championship. And then there was

Pitt, whose-young Panthers were
expected to lose by two touch-
downs.

But Pitt,.which surprised every- ’

one byvplaying tough against the
nation’s top-ranked team and even
leading for much of the third and

fourth quarters, refused to lie down

and serve as a stepping stone in

.State’s quest for glory. The

Panthers eventually would lose,
17-10, but not before supplying the
fourth largest crowd in Penn State
history with its biggest scare.

Pitt’s season should, for the most
part, revolve around Clancy.

Clancy is an enforcer who can
end most on-court difficulties with
a glance, but his worth to Pitt
involves much more than that. His
thrust is tempered well by
astonishing agility and the fact a
good head rides his substantial
shoulders. ‘

While Clancy leads by example,

Paterno said, “but another touch-
down would’ve”bothered me.”

Added the Penn State coach,
“Pitt played an awfully good
football game. They mixed up their
defenses and coverages and did a
great job stopping our running
game. They played well.”

So well, in fact, that in State
College bars after the game Penn
State fans offered sighs of relief,

rather than their customary brags. ,

The pollsters,‘who again_ rated Pitt

words of praise for the Panthers’

offense during Pitt’s early games
while _Grgurich waits for another
point guard to emerge.

Williams is Pitt’s best defensive
player and, with Knight and
Strickland, one of its captains.

Ed Scheuermann, junior from

Baldwin, has spent a couple of .

years at Pitt taking knocks on- and
off-court because relatively few
pounds have clung‘ to his 6-11
frame. But Scheuermann shoots
well, is intelligent and is one of
Pitt’s largest assets.

Whether Scheuermann can com-
plement Clancy near the basket
and his ability to handle such
centers as Duke’s Mike Gminski
will determine in large measure
whether Pitt’s hopes for a
tournament bid will be realized.

Terry Knight, a fifth-year senior,
averaged more than 10 points per
game last year and, at 6-5, can
swing between guard and forward.

Strickland, a six-foot guard with
a heart of blue and gold, last
season was asked to offer off-the-
bench innoculations spelling of
spirit and points when either was
needed by the Panthers, and he
filled that prescription often and

The game was ﬁlled with. so
many_.key factors that it would be

difﬁcult to choose the decisive one. ~

The 25-mile-per-hour winds
played a definite role, according to
Paterno, who said that “if we
couldn’t hold Pitt (in the fourth
quarter) with the wind at our backs,
we ' didn’t deserve to win...It
definitely ‘affected the outcome of
the game.”

As a bit of proof, no points were
scored_ in the north end zone, —out of

which the winds were blowing. It

prompted , interesting strategies
from both sidelines. Patemo opted
for a third-down gpunt with time
running out in the first quarter so
Scott Fitzkee would have the gales
behind him, and Pitt coach Jackie

Sherrill ‘elected to kick off with the V

'wind to start the second half. »

“The wind was a big factor,”
Sherrill said. “We had to be aware
of it at all times. We took it in the
third quarter to make something
happen.” .

Turnovers, especially the early
fumbles, proved to be crucial. The
Lions and the Panthers exchanged
fumbles early in the first quarter
prior to one of Pitt’s patented
defensive stands—another of the
game’s key elements—-on the Pitt
10-yard line. The Panthersfumbled
again, however, leading to — a
14-yard touchdown drive by Penn.
State.

And then there was THE play of
the game—an unPatemo-like gam-
ble on a fourth-and-2 play from the
Pitt 4 with ﬁve minutes left in the
game. With Pitt leading by three,
Paterno shunned the field goal and
sent Mike Guman off the left side
for the go-ahead score. It was the
second touchdown of the game for
Guman, who is the only Lion to
reach the endzone against Pitt in
the last two years.

“We had to go out and do it
ourselves,” said Paterno, after
winning his 19th straight game.
“We couldn’t wait for another
break. We got all the breaks we
were going to get from Pitt.

Bisons’ Balance Blasts Mistaken Panther

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

Bloomsburg head coach Roger

5"" Sanders thanked his reserves for

his wrestling squad’s 20-11 victory
over Pitt at the Field House last
week.

“We have a very balanced
team-—'-no superstars,” Sanders
said after the match. “Our starting
118-pounder may have torn car-
tilage in his knee. Our starting
134-pounder had a knee out, and
our starting 190-pounder broke a
hand in practice. We knew the
match would be tough, but we have
balance.”

The Eastern Wrestling League
rival Bisons broke an early 3-3 tie
after the 126-pound match by

sweeping the next three bouts and‘

building an insurmountable 12-3
lead.

“We made a lot of mistakes,”
Panther head coach Dave Adams

said. “Things we haven’t covered -

in practice yet Bloomsburg was
doing.”

Pitt 118-pounder Dan Kubelick,
in his ﬁrst collegiate match, lost to
Bison Don Reese, 6-1, to open the
contest. _

“That was the match right
there,” Sanders claimed. “Reese

lost in eliminations in the 126-
pound class and cut to 118 in the
last couple of days.”

Jose Martinez brought Pitt even
at 3-3 with a 6-5 decision over
freshman Matt Simone, but the
Bisons then came on to take the
next three classes.

Bloomsburg’s Carl Poff (13.4
pounds) decisioned Panther fresh-
man Jeff Gordon, 7-3, while
freshman Gibbes Johnson (142)
surprised Pitt’s Steve Gouletas,
6-3, and Bison Tony Caravella
overcame Ed Bredniak (150), 12-5.
Bloomsburg had a nine-point lead,
12-3, halfway through the match.

Heisman To

Oklahoma running back Billy

yesterday afternoon as the New
York Downtown Athletic Club
presented him with the Heisman

_ Sims is only the sixth junior ever.
to be voted the club’s title of
“outstanding player in the coun-'

in rushing with 1762 yards (160.2

' Prior to the announcement of the
Heisman winner, Oklahoma coach

Barry Switzer had commented,’ “I _ .

feel sure Sims is the best back in
America. We’ve never had anyone

This may be the season in which
Grgurich is not forced to push
freshmen into roles that ask
maturity and offer only pressure in

Scott Grevey, Dwane Wallace and
Ed Wallace) probably will not do

years ago, Neverson led Elmira to a

berth in the ,NCAA Division II

playoffs and the.best record in the
school’s history. Despite this,
Neverson transferred.‘

Elmira was understandably per-
turbed at Neverson’s transfer and
charged Pitt with tampering.

“Yeah, they were pretty mad
-about my leaving,” Neverson said.
“They didn’t do too well last
season after I and a couple of our
other starters left.

“I didn’t do anything illegal and
neither did coach (Tim) Grgurich,”
said Neverson, who also considered
transferring to either Louisville or
St. John’s (N.Y.). “I knew some

people who knew coach Grgurich,, -

so I had no trouble getting in touch
with him. .

“I wrote telling him I would be
interested in transferring, just like

1 did to a few other schools, but he
couldn't really talk to me during
the season.” .

Although he didn’t play, Never-
son gained valuable experience last
season, according to Grgurich.

our system better,” said Panther
coach

‘,‘He practiced and got to know —

scholarship last season, but yet he
came, paid his own way and got to
know some of our players.”_

Neverson considers himself a
good all-around player. Grgurich
agrees but believes the sophomore
is best on defense. .

At 6-foot-4, 185 pounds, Never-
son can play either inside or
outside, although Pitt probably will
use him exclusivelyat guard.

  Pantherettes Bounce Back After We(a)kend Show

By ANNA ARLO’ITA

Pitt News Staff Writer
Coming off adisappointing
the Pitt
women's basketball team proved it
means business this season by
soundly defeating Morris Harvey,
100-70, Monday night at the Field
House.

Last weekend, the Pantherettes
placed ‘ fourth in the Tennessee
Tip-Off Tournament‘, as they lost
both their opening and consolation
games. Pitt opened the tourna-

ment with a 78-61 loss to Ole Miss .
. (the tournaments’ eventual winner)

and lost the following night to
Tennessee Tech, 78-70. The
Pantherettes played the opener
without All-America candidate
Wanda Randolph, who was out

saw limited action against Tech and
was not dressed for the Morris
Harvey contest.

The Pantherettes scored first in
Monday's action ona Debbie Lewis
layup. Lewis finished the game
with 21 points and eight assists to
lead Pitt in both categories.

Six other players scored in
double ﬁgures——Stephanie Strip-
ling tallied 15, Kit Loefﬂer 14,
Carol Dugan 12 and Tracy Evans,
Robin Fry, and Rita Rodriquez all
with 10. High scorer for the Golden
Eagles was co-captain Kanthe
Penczak with 16. .

Coach Jean Balthaser -praised

the entire team for its fine
performances against Morris
Harvey. “The girls ran the ball

better tonight,” said‘ Balthaser.

ties, which is what we’re looking
for.”

Balthaser also acknowledged
some fine individual efforts from
her team. “Debbie Lewis was just
outstanding,” said Balthaser.
“Senior Kit Loefﬂer also played
super; she played both ends of the
floor very well. Captain Robin Fry
really established herself as a
mover on the ﬂoor in both the
tournament and against Morris
Harvey.”

The momentum swayed the early
minutes of the game but the
Pantherettes were quick in taking
control and led ‘throughout the
entire contest and opened~ a
31-point lead at one point. The
Pantherettes ﬁnished the 1 game
with a 45 percent shooting average

from the floor and a 63 percent
free-throw average as they convert-
ed on 14 of 22 shots. Loefﬂer led
the Pantherettes in rebounding
with 11; Fry followed with 10.

« On Dec. 16 Pitt will face Howard
University, where junior center
Randolph is expected to return to
action. “Anytime you lose a starter
it’s going to hurt you,” said
Balthaser, concerning Randolphs’_
absence from the tournament.

Freshman Gail Aughburns filled
in for Randolph and saw her first
action as a collegiate player._ ‘_‘Gail
did a nice job rebounding for. us,”
said .Balthaser. ‘.~‘She madeisome
freshman mistakes, like any
freshman will do. We’ve played all

- FlNDl  AJOB:

‘Bashing the Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs is stupid. -

V We need more cooperation—not conflict——between "busi-
ness and government. Just think how much more we’d all
get done if government would tap the experience and
imagination of business people, not force us to focus on
technicalities and procedures. Let’s stop making the busi-
ness system spin its wheels trying to skid through a
minefield of fiendishly detailed, _horribly long-winded
and hopelessly obscure regulations. If America will
set clear goals-and provide a few carrots, business
will find the ways to get things done quickly

 and economically.

Next time somebody saysjwe-ought to make busi-
ness do something, perhaps you'd like to ask
that person to think up agood carrot to use,
instead of a stick. It’s ‘important to you and the
17,000,000 other Americans who’ll be joining the
hunt for jobs over the next ten years.

Good luck in your search for a job.

let us hear YOUR plain talk about jobs!
We’ll send you a free booldet if you do

Does our message make sense to you? We’d like
to know what you think Your personal experi-
ences. Facts to prove or disprove our point. Drop
‘us a line. We’d like your plain talk. For telling us
your thoughts, we'll send you more infomzation
on issues affecting jobs. Plus Armco is famous

_ handbook, How to Get a Job. It answers 50 key
questions you ’ll need to know. Use it to set yourself
apart, above the crowd. Write Armco, Educational
Relations Dept. U-6, General Offices, Middletown,

Ohio 45043. Be sure to include a stamped, -
self-addressed business-size envelope.

. about trying more carrots, fewer sticks? _ -
. ' Every time government wants to give America sometlting
5 -yet doesn’t want to tax people directly to pay for it-.—the
 result is usually a law requiring business to pay the freight.
f Too little gas or oil? Make business rebuildfactories to
use coal. Utility bills too high? Make business subsidize
homeowners. Want cleaner air and water? Make indus-
try install additional layers of pollution control equip-
ment. Wantt less risk for people at work? Make" ' ’
. business, re-engineer every piece of equipment -to
remove all human responsibility. -The cost of all this
‘is enormous. Wasted money results in inﬂation
and lost .jobs. A - ’ f
Companies often grumble about the sock-it-to
‘ business situation. But we do get things done when
people demand them, and that’s more than most insti-
tutions in this imperfect world. The fact_is we are the
Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs.
It’s not the responsibilities themselves that worry us.
It’s the way in which new tasks are saddled on our backs.
We’re hit with deadlines. Slapped with fines.
Handed detailed orders on exactly how we must _
try to solve each problem, by people who aren’t
familiar with science or engineering or finance.
We’re forced to spend vast sums with no re-
course. Either these costs pour right on through
to the prices we have to charge, or we have to
‘ eat the costs ourselves—leaving less to spend on
research, better products and jobs.’
What can America do about this situation?
We wish our government would use more carrots
and fewer sticks.

Plain talk about CARROTS AND STICKS
The power of government is just as great when
it’s used to pull, rather than push. Why not let gov-
ernment help set America’s goals, and encourage
each company to pick the most effective, least expen-
sive means to reach them? That one idea could save
untold billions of dollars for everybody.
