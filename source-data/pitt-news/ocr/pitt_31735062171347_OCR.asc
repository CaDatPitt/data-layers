: The Pitt   New -

Student Affairs Change Viewed

(Editor's Note: This summer, the
Student Affairs area of the Univer-
sity, under the direction of Vice
Chancellor Bernard Kobosky, was
substantially reorganized, new
personnel were hired, and a major
physical move was undertaken.

(The primary purpose of the
changes, according to Kobosky and
Dr. Charles Montgomery, Dean of
Student Development, was to facili-
tate student involvement. A sec-
ondary purpose was to increase ad-
ministrative efficiency. '

(Whether the objectives of the re-
organization are realized will de-
pend both on students and admin-
istrators. If “shared responsibility”

' in the Student Affairs area is to be-

come a reality, students must take
advantage of the new opportuni-
ties for participation available to
them and administrators must live
up to their pledges of receptivity.)

by SUE RUFFNER
and JOANN REDONDO

Under Montgomery were plac-
ed a Director of Student Activities
and a Director of Special Pro-
grams. In addition. the areas of
Student Aid and Admissions
were combined under a Dean of
Aid and Enrollment. Ken Wenger
from Carnegie-Mellon University
was chosen to fill that post. while
Bob Newcombe. formerly of Penn
State. assumed the position of Di-
rector of Admissions. Charles
Dees remained Director of Stu-
dent Aid.

The Student Affairs area still
includes the offices-of Housing.
Student Health. Placement. and a
new area of Student Affairs Re-
search. dHected by John Loch.
former head of the Student Union.

Vice Chancellor for Student Af-
fairs Bernard Kobosky stated in
an interview that the basic pur-
pose behind the changes was to
make the Student Affairs office
more “operable” for students.
The new ~ location of the office
(fifth floor, SU) is part of the idea
of becoming functional.

"In the past. the individual de-
partments were located on differ-
ent parts of the campus." Kobos-
ky said. "The new location of the

Student Affairs office will allow

students to have easier access to
many of those departments. “

As of now. the offices in the Stu-
dent Union are somewhat unor-
ganized and crowded. Kobosky
stated. however. that this situa-
tion will be remedied by January.
when the offices will be fully
ready. By then. the Student Af-
fairs offic-es will also include
parts of the sixth floor. "Theyre
cramped now but it's worth it if
this arrangement will benefit the
student." Kobosky declared.

He added that he would “like to
see the Student Union renovated
so that all the people associated
with Student Affairs can be in one
place.” Presently, some depart-
ments, such as Housing and Stu-
dent Health, are not in the Union.

From an administrative stand-
point. Kobosky explained that the
changes in Student Affairs were
made to increase the effective-
ness of the area. Instead of nine
deans reporting to Kobosky. there
will be only five. while the re-
maining four will report directly
to Dr. Charles Montgomery.

Dr. Montgomery. the Dean of
Student Development. now ad-
vises the Student Union and asso-
ciated activities. including orien-
tation. fraternities and sororities.
and personal advising. According
to him the desire for student par-
ticipation and a sense of “shared
responsibility” was primarily re-
sponsible for the creation of the
Student Development office.

“The creation of this office is
indicative that the University is
moving away from the concept of
‘loco parentis.’ We work with stu-
dents instead of telling them ‘this
is how it will be done.”

When asked what he considers
the immediate problem facing
him. Montgomery replied. "The
problem is to get students active-
ly involved and to encourage them
to work with us in carrying out
plans generally initiated by other

' students.“

He added a note of optimism.
however. "I have seen an inter-
esting. warm. responsive group
of students with great human po-
tentiality. They will be of assis-
tance in developing the position."

"Your Own Thing”

Your Own Thing, an original
rock musical and winner of the
New York Drama Critics‘ Circle
Award as the best musical of the
1968-69 season. will be pre-
sented at the Syria Mosque on Sat-
urday at 8 p.m.

Tickets are available at the
University Ticket Center for $2.

The show. based loosely on
Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,
travels with a rock band consist-
ing of an electric organ. electric
guitar. fender bass and drums. A
multi-media production. it uses
special lighting effects, sound ef-
fects and slide projection to en-
hance the action.

The play, which takes place in
New York City, concerns the fol-
lowing characters: Sebastian and
Viola, who are pop singers; Oli-
via, who runs a discotheque, and
Orson, who is the agent for a rock
group called “The Apocalypse.”

Heightened TNight Trafﬁc 
Ties Up CL Elevators

by KATHY HOFFMAN

The Cathedral of Learning ele-
vator operators feel that an addi-
tion to their personnel is urgently
needed. Steve Zych. an operator
who has been working at the Ca-
thedral for two years. expressed
his concern for the people who use
the elevators in the evenings.

He said. “It is bad enough to be
held up during the day. but there
should be no reason for this to oc-
cur at night. It never happened

A two years ago.“

Zych mentioned that there used
to be six students working at night
in 1968. In late 1968. the numer
was cut down to five. and then in
1969. an additional cut reduced the
number to four. Zych commented
on the fact that enrollment in the

l) Congenital and rheumatic
hear disease.

2) Cardiovascular disorders
and hypertensive heart dis-
ease.

3) Chronic bronchopulmonary
diseases, asthma, bronchi-

tis, etc.

4) Diabetes mellitus and
other chronic metabolic dis-
orders.

Epidemic influenxa has oc-
curred in the United States the
past three years with varying
frequency and geographic ex-
tent. The vaccines available
have been effective and have
offered protection. There is un-
certainty about an epidemic
this year, however, all persons
would do well to avail them-
selves of this service.

Dr. Robert Hingson, Univer-
sity Professor of Anesthesiolo-
gy and Public Health, will co-
ordinate the program with his
team of jet-gun innoculators.

evenings has increased greatly
since 1968. He said that the eve-
nings are quite busy. with prac-
tically all the floors from five on
up being used.

At the beginning of the Fall
Term, William D. Jones, supervi-
sor of the student operators, turn-
ed in a report explaining the con-
ditions of the Cathedral during the
evenings. His report estimated
that the busy period lasts from
4:20-8 p.m., when the first eve-
ning classes finish and from 8:30-
10 p.m. The report Jones sent to
Mr. Herold, head of Mechanical
Maintenance, and in charge of
hiring student operators, request-
ed an additional student for Fri-
day evenings, and an additional
student for Monday through
Thursday evenings. These addi-
tions would have increased the
number of operators from four to
five on Monday through Thurs-
day evenings, and from two to
three on Friday evenings. Herold
agreed to the Friday evening re-
quest, however, he refused to hire
an additional student for Monday
through Thursday.

The students say ‘that they are
trying their best. but that it is ter-
ribly difficult with only four oper-
ators. The operators work from
4:20-9:30. five nights a week.
Each student is allotted a 20
minute break. These breaks occur
until 8 p.m. By 8 p.m.. all the eve-
ning classes have begun. During
this time. there are only three
elevators in use. The students
would like to a fifth operator for
at least the period up till 8 p.m.

However, they claim that Herold
has been uncooperative to their
request for an additional opera-
tor.

After being asked what he plan-
ned on doing about the insufficient
number of evening operators.
Herold expressed his opinion that
the present number was suffi-
cient. Herold said that he inves-
tigates any complaint within rea-
son. He claims that he personallyvyr
investigated the situation. and
found passengers being held up
for prolonged amounts of time
while the operators talked
amongst themselves. or read a
book. This accusation is not true.
according to Jones who super-
vises the operators.

Herold stressed the fact that he
is trying to conserve the Univer-
sity’s money. He stated that he
wants to get the work that he is
paying for, and feels that an addi-
tional worker would just give the
operators more time to frater-
nize. As a closing comment, Her-
old said that if the night starter
says the student operators are
overworked, the matter will b{‘'‘

, investigated. However, Jones, the

night starter, said he has already
issued several requests to Her-
old, and has not gotten any ‘posi-
tive results.

The student operators said they
"don't enjoy feeling like guinea
pigs for Herold‘s economy drive.“
Any legal help. and/or support
leg. Student Government, con-
cerned students. evening eleva-

tors users. etc.). would be appre-  ?

ciated by the operators.

"They keep talking about
these huge sums of money that
GM is offering us." noted one of
the local union officers. “But
they-forget to mention that with
a company this size. impres-
sive—sounding figures don't
mean that much. If GM offered
us a one-cent hourly wage in-
crease. for instance. they could
honestly claim that we were be-
ing offered $24 million for the
next three year contract per-
iod. even though it only raises
each workers wages by $20."

about inflation."

billion. giving $13.7 billion to
the workers and an equal
amount to the consumers.

DEMAND

In light of this. the [AW has
demanded a 61.5 cent hourly
wage hike and an overall pay
rise of eight per cent over the
next three years.

Inflation has risen over six
per cent this year and has de-
valued the dollar by 64 per
cent over the past 30 years.
Since 1965 it has resulted in a
weekly loss of $18.47 for auto
workers. The purchasing power
of auto workers has been stag-
nating for time and has recently
dechned.

Even more important. the un-
ion has demanded a cost-of-liv-
ing escalator that would raise
their wages with each jump of
the consumer price index. to
prevent wage gains from being
erased by inflation.

BUDGET

According to the Labor De-
partment. the near-poverty
"lower budget" for a family _of
four in an urban area in 1970 is
356.900 and the "moderate bud-
get" is $10600. The average
yearly wage of auto workers in
1970. taking lay-offs into ac-
count. is $8.000. The lowest I
paid workers receive wages low-
er than the "lower budget.“

In 1947 GM was worth $1.4
billion. Today it is worth $10.2
billion. and 93 per cent of this
growth has come directly from
its worker—created profits. Its
net -income has increased over
2.09 times since 1958.

According to Wards Automo-
bile Report and the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, adjusting the
figures to account for inflation.
GM could have cut its prices by
$120 and raised its wages by
45 cents an hour in the last 20
years and still have made the
average US. corporate profit.
Instead of earning $82 billion
they would have earned $54.6

by MARK COHEN

I really had no intention when I began writing
for The Pitt News to get hung up in argument with
right-wing elements in the student body. However.
recent Letters to the Editor have-so distorted my
views and socialist theory in general that I will at-
tempt to reply to these misconceptions.

More than one veteran work-
er at West Mifflin also express-
edilabhorrence of the sickening.
exhausting monotony of the fac-
tory work-routine. "where a
man has to keep us with a ma-
chine."

For this reason. many strong-
ly support the unions “30 and
out" demand which would per-
mit an auto worker to retire on a
$500 a month pension after 30
years ofwork. irrespective olﬂ
age.

The outcome of this strike.
which promises to be long and
hard. is of tremendous impor-
tance to all workers in the Unit-
ed States.

If UAW members win. it will
set important precedents. If
they lose. it will be a serious set-

includes students. most of whom
will join the labor force in com-
ing years.

Jack Simmons stated that he is familiar with
Marxist thinking and that it is “stupid.“ No argu-
ments were presented why this is so.

He then goes on to prove that he has absolutely
no understanding of Marxism altogether. By stat-
ing that workers are no longer exploited he at-
temps to hide the fact that the last few years has,

strikes by workers.

. DISMISSAL

Then he dismisses imperialism as some crea-
tion of a distorted leftist mind. Either Jack is blind
to the real world or he is just plain dishonest.

The US. government has helped engineer coups
in such placesas Indonesia to protest the wealthy
resources of that country for Amerikan corpora-
tions. The result of the coup in Indonesia was the
wholesale murder of 500.000 Indonesians.

CIA and military intervention are used when

they are necessary to U.S. corporate interests

such as in Guatemala. the Congo. Cuba. Vietnam.
Dominican Republic. Laos and Cambodia.

This. however. does not even begin to explain
the economic stranglehold that U.S. corporations
have over Latin America. Africa. Asia. Western
Europe and its domestic colonies of Black. Brown
and Native-Americans «sometimes referred to as
Indians).

EGOTISM OUT
The criticism that socialism attempts to do
away from egotism is quite true. Honest and true
relationships between people cannot occur until
self aggrandizement is eliminated.

It seems clear that communication can only oc-
cur between equals if communication is truly
meant to resolve problems rather than to merely
bullshit or intentionally deceive. '

The grossest distortion of all in Jack's letter
was lumping together people like Marx. Lenin and
Ho Chi Minh with Hitler and Mussolini. Hitler stat-
ed repeatedly that the greatest enemy that the
Nazi theory of‘ racilialism. imperialism and Ary-
an supremacy had was Marxism. V

Ho Chi Minh‘ proved Hitler correct by leading
Vietnam in its struggles against French colonial-
ism and Amerikan imperialism. “ .

Friday, October 2, 1970-—THE PITT NEWS—Pai2e 5

Shostak Defended, eporter Hit

Rosen Uncharitable

Editor. The Pitt News:

Having been witness to the
great Shostak-Rosen episode of
last week. I feel obliged to make

’ corrections to the story of Dana

Ventriglia and to add several ob-
servations of my own.

At 3:30 that day. there were a
large group of students assem-
bled outside the lecture hall wait-
ing for the 4:00 Shostak lecture to
begin. There were no signs post-
ed on the doors that an exam was
in progress and the bulk of the
group had no idea that Dr. Rosen
had decided to give an exam in
the t.hird week of the term.

Students from the Rosen class
begin to leave between 3:35 and
3:40 and the assumption was that
the lecture had ended early. The
entire room was filled with stu-
dents at 3:50. It was only then
that Dr. Rosen approached the
microphone. with hands on hips.
and stated that he would not leave
the stage until the entire lecture
hall had been vacated.

In spite of Dr. Rosens rather
uncharitable demeanor. the fact
is that many of Dr. Shostak's stu-
dents did attempt to leave but
couldn‘t due to more students en-
tering the room who were un-
aware of any problem. Dr. Shos-

tak's voice did come over the mi-
crophone but he “lambasted“ no
one. He asked the crowd to leave
the room. His use of the word
"hyper" to describe Dr. Rosen's
emotional state was. in my opin-
ion. a gross understatement.

I recalled another large assem-
bly of individuals which tool place
last spring. It was a faculty meet-
ing concerning the killings at Kent
State. At that time. Dr. Rosen
made a passionate plea for more
"charity" to be shown to the
members of the assembly. This
was done in order to quell the out-
bursts of the members present
who were appalled at what they
felt was a second Boston Mass-
acre. In light of Dr.. Rosen‘s ac-
tions of last week. to a situation
-of much less emotion than Kent
State. I would have to describe his
response as extremely uncharit-
able.

Having taught a rather unortho-
dox course myself last term. I
was present last week in order to
observe Dr. Shostaks technique
so that I might improve my own.
I suggest that Dr. Rosen do the
same. There are other ways to
make students come to class than
the threat of punishment on
exams. A

There is much to be learned
from instructors such as Dr.
Shostak. and the University is in-

deed fortunate to have an_educa-
tional experimentalist of his cali-
ber. As for Dr. Rosen. young Po-
litical Science Ph.Ds. who do
nothing but lecture and give ex-
ams. are a dime a dozen.

To the Editor. The Pitt News:

Dana Ventriglias report of a
disturbance in the Common Facil-
ities Building last Thursday is not
true. I was there and what I saw
does not correspond to what she
wrote.

I was in Room 121 to attend
Dr. Shostaks lecture from 3:51
on. Yes. there were many stu-
dents from Dr. Shostak's class in
the room and there were also
great numbers of students‘ out-
side in the hall and many entering
Room, 120 which was then vacant.

At 3:54 Dr. Rosen took to the
microphone and asked "Shostaks
people" (no one owns people. Dr.
Rosen) to leave the room as his
exam was still in progress.

I am completely certain of
the time ‘here as I was in sympa-
thy with Dr. Rosen's problem.
checked my watch with the large
one in the rear of the room and
wondered why he had made no
comment before then. Between

3:40 and 3:45 when several of Dr.
Rosen‘s students left the exam
and several of Dr. Shostak‘s en-
tered the room. It seems to me
that then was the time to act. not
at six minutes to four a no-mans-
land as fargas class time is con-
cerned.

Many of the students were
freshman; they had been at the
University barely four weeks. A
word from Dr. Rosen early sure-
ly would have prevented the con-
tinued influx. The alleged "storm-
ing“ of the lecture hall occurred
from 3:50 on.

The comment by Miss Ventrig-
lia that Shostak allegedly turned
off Rosen‘s microphone is but a
more blatant example of irre-
sponsible reporting. This is en-
tirely untrue and surely could
have been checked by a phone call
to Shostak.

Although I was not present at

the FASC meeting, I too spoke at»

length with a member of the Coun-
cil. This member did not verify

report as being “unbiased.” So,’ ii

Dana, I guess it depends on who

you speak to, doesn’t it? Indeed,‘ 

much of Dr. Rosen’s comments
concerned Dr. Shostak’s methods
of/ teaching and other emotional
issues not to the point of the com-
plaint.

It is obvious that there are

many problems inherent in mov-  .
ing a great number of people in - 

and out of lecture halls in the 10

.minutes provided between class-

es. These problems can be solved
only by the individuals involved

and certainly not by’ trial in a’ .. ;
newspaper or by reporting as fact  f

of innuendos and allegations.

McGregor
. Opposes

Legislation

Jim McGregor, Republican

-candidate for the State Senate

from the East Hills area (44th
Senatorial district), came out
against the Legislature’s tamper-
ing with the internal affairs of
‘state owned or state related col-
leges and universities.

Speaking at a Young Repub-
lican meeting at the Wooden

Keg, McGregor voiced his op-

position to such legislation as
that which requires state-aided
schools to report students involv-
ed in demonstrations or arrested
for felonies to the PHEAA.

McGregor stated that demon-
strators should not be permitted
to keep other students from at-
tending classes, but that the mat-
ter was an internal one to be
dealt with by the Board of Trus-
tees or the Administration, not
by the State Legislature.

The Pitt Law School graduate
felt the only justification for the
repeal of a students state schol-
arship would be his conviction of
a serious felony.

McGregor favors a state in-
come tax only after an extensive
program of tax reform. He cited
the example of the $20,000,000 per
year lost to the State Treasury
because of the farmers’ state

1 sales tax exemption has one area
needing reform.

Pitt Young Republicans endors-
" ed Jim McGregor during the
meeting and decided to make
his campaign their main project
for this election.

by VIRGINIA COOK
Need help? Call 261-6010.
Need help about drugs? Call 261-0808.

These are the numbers of the Information Volunteer Services of
Allegheny County, an agency supported by the Community Chest
Agency United Fund Allegheny County.

‘It matches over 800 “helping" agencies with thousands of peo-
ple who need help.

Last month in September, in response to Judge Richard Went-
ley’s plea for a drug information service, the agency opened it's drug
referral service, to help drug addicts, parents of drug users, and or-
ganizations cope with drug abuse. A staff of professional social work-
ers now answers 261-0808, 24 hours a day.

During the first two weeks of operation, 200 calls were taken.
They ranged from addicts who needed help kicking the habit to or-
ganizations requesting speakers on drug abuse.

In each case, the individual caller is given as much attention as
needed, and told where the nearest agency equipped to handle his
problem is located.

Addicts, for instance, may want to talk for one or two hours.
Other people may only be requesting pamphlets or speakers.

In the case of the addict, the social workers try to reach the core
of the addict’s problem, why he started taking drugs. Drug abuse
may be a symptom of deeper social problems such as broken homes,
unemployment, or dropping out of school. The addict’s background
determines what agency can best serve him.

Because of the increasing number of calls, the agency hopes it
will receive additional funds to hire an additional social worker.

Mr. Aaron Sacks, executive director of the agency, noted that
the drug information service is only one arm of the agency. It pro-
vides people with counseling on all kinds of problems: alcoholism.
unwed parenthood, nursing homes. and day care centers — even
where to send your little brother to summer camp.

Sacks pointed out that there are several other information agen-
cies in Allegheny County. Among them are HELP, a student infor-
mation agency, KDKA's Call for Action, SWITCHBOARD, and the
Luthern Ministers ‘Listening Ear’.

In addition to helping people with problems, the agency helps
people who want to help. Its Volunteer Service coordinates people
who would like to donate their time and service with agencies who
could use their services.

Third in A Series

Consumer Protection Evaluated

by JANE HENDERSON

"To what influences is a consumer reacting?" is
the main question being raised to the students in
CAS 10: Consumer Protection, one of the new series
of CAS “awareness" courses.

According to instructor Pete Jacobson, recent
Pitt Law School graduate and employee of the Con-
sumer Division of Neighborhood Legal Services in

A Pittsburgh. there exists a general lack of aware-

ness and information pertaining to consumer af-
fairs. "With the rapid rise in technology," said Ja-
cobson. “many new products have been put on the
market. and along with them came abusive prac-
tices and misuse of advertising.“ One of the goals
of the course is to make students aware of some of
this misuse.

Starting from the assumption that the consumer
is not protected, the course asks the question,
“What do we have to do?” Jacobson states that his
role is only that of leading the students. He wants to
stir their imaginations for solutions to the myriad
of unanswered questions about buying patterns and
other consumer affairs.

After offering his view of solutions to the prob-

A lems. he then wants the students themselves to

‘.'tell why my solution won‘t work." Although gen-
erally pleased with his students, Jacobson's only
disappointment is that “the students haven‘t press-

‘ed me enough. I want them to call me and force me

to defend my position."

Purposes of the discussion—oriented course are
twofold—-to raise problems and promote awareness

of consumer affairs. and to involve students in solv-
ing some of these problems. The second purpose is
realized in the form of field projects. which may in-
clude setting up an Alliance for Consumer Protec-
tion at Pitt, working with the agencies of the Bureau
of Consumer Protection. or investigatives. such as
comparing super market prices. The only written
work required of each student is a paper analyzing
his project. and all are encouraged to take the
course Credit-No/ Entry to ease the stress of
grades.

The format of the course is expected to make the
class aware of the problems caused by the rise of
technology, determinants of the consumer market,
abusive practices in marketing and advertising, and
the problems of the poor.

Especially sensitive to the problems of the poor.
Mr. Jacobson states that their-major problem is
lack of information and any effective organization,
and as a result, they are often duped into buying
things on fraudulent terms. Extremely complicat-
ed, the questions raised will be related to each other
over the entire term. Inadequate and complex laws
concerning buying will also be examined.

Although it is still uncertain whether the course
will be continued next term, Jacobson said that if it
is, he would like to set up a seminar, which would
continue the field work but emphasized the prob-
lems of the poor. This depends, he said, on the re-
action of the class, but when asked for a comment
of the course, one of the class members assured
that the course is “really interesting and enlighten-
mg."

Without three top starters.
Coach Carl DePasqua and the
Pitt Panthers prepare to tame a
young Kent State squad that is
looking for a pathway intothe
world of major college football.

The Golden Flashes‘ Coach
Dave Puddington is well aware
of the class of football his Kent
Staters are used to. “I know Pitt
has great depth and size." he
sa_vs. "There is no doubt that
the Panthers are back. I‘ve got-
ten raving reports from my

scouts who witnessed the UCLA
and Baylor games."

Pitt Holds Key To Kent’

the Pitt game as a stepping
stone into the big time. Accord-
ing to Assistant Coach Steve
Petro, who scouted both Kent
State’s 24-14 loss to Ohio U. and
their 27-21 victory over Buffalo.
“They have nothing to lose.”

“They aren’t a big ballclub.
They have good speed in the
backfield and their defense is
very rangy.”

Leading the Golden Flashes
attack are three quarterbacks.
Steve Broderick is the top man
at the helm. According to Petro,
“he has the best arm.” Broderick
has thrown 32 passes for 17 com-
pletions and 239 yards. Ted
Bowersox and Larry Hayes ro-
tate with Broderick, in most
cases by bringing in plays from
the sidelines.

“Hayes," offers Petro, “is very
fleetfooted, but he isn’t the
passer. He’ll run on anything."
Hayes has gained 110 net yards
in State’s first two games and
would have had more if a 90-
yard-touchdown run was not call-
ed back in the Buffalo game.

The KS1’ backfield features a
39“. 205 pound fullback Don
Nottingham. Nottingham has
gained 128 yards this year and is
also a good blocker. Last year
he was leading the country in

yards rushing two-thirds the
way into the season. but got
hurt. He finished in the top

twenty with close to 1.000 yards
gained.

Panther coach Carl DePasqua
is not underestimating the Gold-
en Flashes. "Theyre extremely

 

 

  

 
     
    

 

  

 

aggressive. They'll stay in there
sixty minutes and slug it out
with you all the way."

Due to the severely sprained
ankle he suffered in the Baylor
game, first string Pitt quarter-
back John Hogan will be side-
lined this Saturday and junior
Dave Havern will take over the
Panther helm.

Havern. who piloted to grid-
ders through the second half of
Baylor game. completed 
passes while leading touchdown
drives of 80 and 83 yards in the
fourth quarter of that game.

Hogans absence is  tough

blow for us.“ said DePasqua.
"The more Hogan plays the
better he'll be." “But the old

Stadium Double Header

' The Pitt soccer team will serve as the preliminary hosts
prior to the Panther—Kent State football game tomorrow in
the first football-soccer doubleheader at Pitt Stadium.

You really can’t call the affair a doubleheader, though.

Admission to the 9 a.m. soccer game is free and all view-
ers will asked to leave the Stadium afterwards. Those with
tickets, of course, will be able to re-enter the seating area for
L the 1:30 p.m. grid contest.

For the football followers, there is another new flair to
the Pitt-KSU game. Not originally scheduled as ‘one, the game
‘is now a Youth Day event, with anyone under 18 being admit-
ted for the price of one dollar. ‘ '

To prevent freebies from the soccer game, the soccer
- fans will also be asked to sit in one section, near mid-field.

Runners Place
 lst Eleven Men

By MARTY HELLMAN
The cross country team literally ran all over the Cleveland State

 Vikings on Wednesday afternoon at Cleveland, romping to an easy
L. 15-50 victory in their first dual meet of the season.

The harriers completely outclassed the Viking runners, as" the

  

I first eleven men to finish the race were from the Pitt squad.

An example of the teams superiority over the Ohioans was the

“If they are able to get far out
in front,” Coach Jim Banner ex-
plained, “they’ll bunch .up and
run together. ‘

"I just wish that they could do
that all of the time.”

Tied for seventh and eighth po-
sitions were Bob Hagner and Ken
Silay. They finished the course
22 seconds behind the top six run-
.ners.

Mike Nolan, John Black and
Bill Harvey concluded the clean
sweep of the eleven spots as they
came in 9th, 10th and 11th respec-
tively. They were 50 seconds be-
hind the leaders. '2 -

“All of the boyd did my well
and I am pleased with everyone,”
Banner said.

Because the exact length of the
course was not known, Banner
could not tell whether or not the
times recorded were good.

by MIKE MILLER

Coach Leo Bemis and the soccer team have been going up against
some rugged ball teams and Wednesday they got the worst of it, going

down before Bucknell, 4-2.

“They (Bucknell) are strictly a West Chester-type ball team. They

A play the same style of ball,”, stated coach Bemis.

In Saturday’s victory ‘over West Chester, shouts of “if we’re going
to lose——lets take a few of them down with us," were heard coming

from the West Chester bench.

The situation was much the
same at Bucknell, but with other
complications.

“There was poor officiating,"
reported Bemis, “They allowed
them to foul and bring the game
down to their level. They could
kick and play rough and get away

 withit."

In addition, Bemis was minus
one starter and had two others
flying on one wing.

Conference. “Tsima” Lekoma

was hobbled in the West Chester‘

match with a knew injury. Ac-
cording to the trainers, he has a
strained medial ligament and
will be out of action for at least
three weeks.

Pika Downs F iji,

“We missed Tsima’s influence
in the forward line," reported Be-
mis.

John White and Tony Nichola-
kopoulous sustained ankle in-
juries in Saturday’s match which
were aggravated at Bucknell.

Gary Midock reinjured his knee
when making a slide tackle.

Despite the loss, Bemis was
pleased with the team.

“For the whole first half we
pounded them but the goalie kept
tipping them over the crossbar
and making saves,” stated the
coach.

Ali Rdissi scored both of Pitt’s
goals, but Bemis felt that the

Cops Division Crown

By MARK SIGMON

. Backing Don Eshenbaugh’s fine pitching with a tight defense, A
Pi Kappa Alpha copped its fraternity softball division Tuesday by

edging Phi Gamma Delta, 3-2. Pika joins Delta Tau Delta and Delta
Sigma Phi in the Frat. championship series.

Played under the lights and in a biting wind, the ‘playoff was a
defensive strugglethroughout. Eshenbaugh limited the Phi Gams to

eight hits and gave up no runs
after the first inning. Mean-
while, Phil Sherbuck only allow-
ed six Pika hits, but an unearned
run in the third inning sent
Sherbuck down to his initial loss
of the season.

Pi Kappa _Alpha opened the
game with consecutive singles by
Tom Bailey and Greg Hyland.
Jack Hannon’s double, scored
Bailey and the former scored two
outs later on Eshenbaugh’s sac-
rifice fly to deep left.

However, the Fijis stormed
back in the bottom half of the
first inning. A walk to Dave
“Emo” Emery preceded singles
by Jim “Duke” Ayers, Van

Krause, and Billy Hull. Then,

.with two men on and two out,

Rocky Pile fanned to end the
threat, with the score knotted at
2-2. ~
Two innings later, John Hut-
ton committed two errors and the
Pikas took advantage of the op-
portunity, as Hannon delivered
the game-winning sacrifice fly.
*Sparkling defensive plays aid-
ed both teams. Paul Henderson
was a vacuum at third base for
Pi Kappa Alpha. Fijis Ayers and

scoring should have been higher
as shots from four and five
yards out were missed.

“The team never quit,” Bemis
stated. “They were battling until
the final whistle. They never quit,
either individually or collective-
ly.”

Tomorrow the booters will face
undefeated Carnegie—Mellon.
C’MU’s season record consists of
two shut—uts.

“All wencan do is lick our
wounds and hope we’re well for
the next one," said Bemis.

Pitt Camaro
  Could Race
In Indy Run

Bob Fryer, fresh from his first
truly successful race this fall,
may take the Pitt Camaro to In-
dianapolis this weekend.

If things go as planned, the
Blue and Gold car will be racing
at Indianapolis Raceway Park in

A its next-to-last fall appearance.

Last week the Camaro finished
in third place in a Savannah,
Georgia race, gathering it only
four pointon the National Sports
Car tour. At this stage it is prac-
tically impossible for the car to
receive enough points to be eli-
gable for the National Champ-
ionship race.

Girls’ Hockey Team
Ties Chatham Squad
In Scoreless Contest

by ELLEN GANLEY

On Wednesday afternoon. Pitt and Chatham met for what develop-
ed into a hard fought battle on the hockey field. and the teams had to

settle for a scoreless tie.

After last week's defeat at the hands of C-MU. the Pitt team was
definitely out to prove that they could handle the strong Chatham team.

The first half of the game can be
described in one word—defense.
Pitt gained control of the open-

Harriers
  Sweep to

15-50 Win

(Continued from Page 10)

“They weren’t sure exactly how
long the race was, but it was ap-
proximately six miles.”

In the early stages of the race,
Cleveland State offered more op-
position than they did at the con-
clusion.

I “They were up in there for a
while," Banner, commented, “but
we wore them down after awhile,”

Even though the harriers per-
formed excellently in their first
outing of the campaign, Banner
feels that much more needs to
be accomplished before meets
with tougher opponents.

“We have a long way to go
training-wise,” he said. “So far,
the team has done little speed
work, and we’re going to have
to work on this from now on.”

The harriers resume action next
Friday at the Notre Dame Invi-
tational, where they will be com-
peting against many of the top
schools in the Midwest.

 

ing bully and made a fine drive
towards the Chatham goal. But
then, as in most of the game. the
offense just couldn't get it to-
gether for a score.

Pitt's defense was all over the
field and, as a result, Chatham got
only one good try at the Pitt goal.
Pitt's goalie Katie Whiteman
made a fine save on this shot in
the closing seconds of the first
half.

The second period was much
the same as the first half. Al-
though the Chatham offense posed
a serious threat a number of
times, the Pitt defense prevented
them from gaining any solid shots
at the goal.

The Pitt team also mounted a
number of strong attacks on the
Chatham goal with one shot bare-
ly being deflected by the Chatham
goalie. As the end of the period
neared. each team seemed to gain
strength looking for the goal that
would mean a win.

With less than a minute of play
left, the Pitt offense caught the
Chat goalie on the wrong side of
the net. A shot by Pitt’s center
forward Lynne Collman missed
the goal by less than two inches.
Seconds later the game ended.

In review of the contest, coach
De Bernstine said the team had
“improved a lot since last week’s
contest with C-MU. They looked
much better.” «

Perhaps a better indication of
the team’s improvement is the
fact that Chatham had previously
beaten C-MU, at whose hands Pitt
suffered last week's 1-0 defeat. In
next week's rematch with C-MU,
you can be sure that the Pitt girls
will be out to prove that their first
loss to that team was just a bad
day.

Congratulations

and

Pitt Tennis Success

by JAN FRY

When its founders nicknamed"
tennis the game of royalty they
must have had Sue Baer and Mary
Swallow in mind. Sue and Mary.
Pitt‘s number one doubles team.
are most definitely the court jes-
ters of the team.

Their motto is “Keep your op-
ponent and partner laughing."
Thus far their strategy has been
successful. They‘ve defeated
C-MU. 6-0, 6-4. and Chatham.
6-1.6-1.

uled match against Pitt on Wed-

will claim a victory.

 

Sue. a sophomre from Great
Neck, N. Y.. has been playing ten-

summer she taught tennis at
Pierce Camp in Birchmont, N. H.,
where she had the opportunity to
play a girl from the Wimbleton
tournaments, Sue Gibbs.

“I played with her in a doubles
match and we defeated our oppon-
ents,”- stated Sue. “Then I defeat-
ed her in a singles match, 6-8,

.8-6, 6-4. I’ll never forget that

day.”

In her “career" Sues won
many trophies. She took the Ver-

"I never played tennis serious-

"I played at the game for five
years but until this summer I nev-

Mary has played in the city-

“Playing with Sue is never dull.

Mary works during the day, goes

ced, “Pika has alsays given us
a rough time. It's just hard to
figure out how we can play so
well and not come out on top.”

Undoubtedly, Eshenbaughs
clutch pitching was the differ-
ence in this cliffhanger. Allow-
ing only three Fiji hits after the
first inning, Eshenbaugh retired
pinch-hitter Dan Davis on a fly
ball to right to end the game.
with the tying run on first base.

The enthusiasm of the fans lent
even more tension to this excit-
ing contest between two evenly
matched teams. Eshenbaugh sum-
med it up by saying, “The Fijis
gave us our two roughest games
of the season. Now we have to
get ready for the Delts (DTD)
this Friday."
