Vol. 69, No.39

BY BILL MOORE

Four ofﬁcial candidates

are

contending for the Student Gov-

ernment Board (SGB) presidential’
/-‘-s_-;_l,_\_seat in the upcoming election.
The four registered candidates,
Stefﬁ Brooks, Larry Platt, Bruce
Keeler, and Paul Hertneky, were
interviewed Thursday by the Pitt
News.
Elections will be held Wednesday,
January 22, and Thursday, January
23, at various polling places on
campus. « A
Presidential candidate Stefﬁ
Brooks explained her campaign
interests as “dealing with the
‘problems’ seen _all over society as
they affect the student.”
Speciﬁc problems she named
were sex discrimination, racial
discrimination, inﬂation, and dis-
 " crimination against gay persons.

These problems are evident at

Pitt, she said, in the form of sexist
textbooks, the Black Studies
., controversy, tuition expenses, and
‘—‘:;.-"' “University opposition to unions.”
“I feel the Student Government

can do a lot more than just spend
money and run a few activities,’.’
Brooks said. “They should be the

most vocal group on campus and

play a role in defending the rights I

of students in society.”
Larry Platt, stressed his involve-

“By getting away and working
with student groups across the
country I’ve gotten a much broader

Platt worked with Nader speciﬁcal-
ly on student-related consumer

Platt added his absence from

hamper his work as president
because he followed the issues
closely while away from campus.
“I was here for two years before

He proposed more involvement by

ifiriconvicted Sen. Nlazzei
  Retains Trustee Post

BY KEN GORMLEY

State Senator Frank Mazzei, who
is currently appealing his recent
conviction by a Federal District
Court for extortion, is still a
member of Pitt's Board of Trustees
but has voluntarily stopped attend-

 ing the Board meetings.

According to Albert C. VanDusen,
_the Secretary of the‘ University,
‘Mazzei has not resigned his post of
the policy-forming Board as a
result of his conviction. But
Vanl)usen added that “Senator
Mazzei, of his own initiative, has
indi_cated,that he will‘attend no
Board meetings until this (Mazzei’s
appeal) is resolved."

Mazzei was appointed by the
Pennsylvania Senate to serve on
Pitt's Board of Trustees November
15, 197.5, and Van Dusen felt the
University would make no efforts to

- take away his seat as long as the
- ‘Senator is making the judicial
appeals guaranteed to ,every citi-

zen. '

"1 would like to think that the
position of the University would be
that a man's innocence_would be

ppresunied until he has .exhausted ;

Although he ‘ _. iot contacted
Mazzei since the .l1ICldeIIt arose, or

.vice-versa, Van Dusen believes
V the Senator's seat will continue to
V be vacant at the Board meetings
during the time he is going through ,

the appeals process.

However, the Secretary felt there
were good chances the Board might
take action to dismiss Mazzei if the

Rathke’s appointment‘ was an-
nounced last Friday, less than two
weeks before the first board

consumer group, the students,”
Rathke said. “The other board
members, such as the politicians,
don’t feel this as strongly.”

‘In next Tuesday's meeting, the
first, Rathke expects to limit her
participation to function as an
observer. Her term will last for four
years, but Rathke may‘ graduate
withinvtwo years after completing
her major in English and speech for

school of General Studies.

Bruce Keeler, a member of this
year’s SGB, said his experience
was important and pledged to force
Board members to work harder.

“As a member of the SGB I’ve
seen ﬁrst hand what a Board
member doesn’t do, and as
president I would insure they get

leaders for help in determining the
concerns and problems of stu-
dents,” Rathke said. The Gover-
nor’s office established student
trustees in 1971 when Shapp
announced that “young people will
provide the Board of Trustees with
input and viewpoints which are
often. ignored or overlooked.”
Rathke’s appointment is viewed
as a continuation of Shapp’s 1971
decision. Shapp also named trus-
tees to the boards of Penn State
University and Temple University.
“I’ am a full-fledged trustee with
voting powers,” Rathke said.
“Since I have all the rightsand
privileges, I have to contribute to
decision making and policy formu-
lation.” Novak was considered
largely responsible for the initia-

tion of the recently passed
academic integrity policy, indicat- A

ing signiﬁcant student input.

The appointment selected Rathke
from a semi-ﬁnal ﬁeld of three
students, each nominated by their
respective student government
cabinets. The nominees included
Rathke, of the General Studies
Student Cabinet, Lynn George
Kissel, of the Graduate and
Professional Students Association,
and Haig Sakoian, recommended
by the Undergraduate Student
government.

The recommendations were made
after reviews of other applicants,
then submitted to the Pennsylvania
Secretary of Education, Dr. John
Pettinger. Pettinger interviewed
the three and passed on their
applications to the Governor's
office. Shapp’s appointment is still
subject to conﬁrmation by the State’.

STEEFI BROOKS

Steffi Brooks, a member of the
Socialist Workers Party and Young
Socialist Alliance, spoke of Pitt as a
“microcosm of the greater
society.” - ‘/

She criticized the present Student
Government Board (SGB) for
“throwing _their forces into ﬁghting
the $.25 time schedule fee instead
of fighting tuition increases.”

Brooks said she was active in the A

__ Black Studies chairmanship con-
Q‘-«‘-troversy and in negotiating with the

administration to forbid non-_union

lettuce and grapes from the cafe- ,-

terias. .

She called ROTC an “institution
whose sole function is. to train
people to wage war in other parts of
the world” and advocated the
removal of ROTC from campus.

Access by students to University
financial records was also advo-
cated by Brooks.- “The University
spends large sums of money with-
out speaking to faculty, students,
or staff members,” she complain-
ed. .

Brooks: pledged" to support wide-

’~>~¢;pread changes in Student Govern-

1/,

' —date_s because “they are some of --

ment structure to make the organi-
zation “more democratic.” and
involve ‘more students.

“The Board is separated organi-
zation that makes decisions for all
the student body. 1 would greatly
expand the Board to include blacks
and women,” she said.

She also advocated revamping of

“Allocations procedures, making

Pitt “part of the community instead
of a hostile enclave,” and urged
voters to support socialist candi-

the most active students on cam-
pus.” She is running in conjunc-
tion with four board candidates:
Rich Gollub, Bill Kalman, Mark
Satinoff, and Bill Waddell.

A 4 erage student as ,“basically frus-

trated " because the. ‘group "that

- represents them is a —_-passive’,
unmoving _groupfo'f "students who '
_' act only'.when_'.hit with ancrisis.” ' -

He proposed ‘to help such students
by" involving the SGB in more
programs aimed at helping the
student on a “ﬁxed and meager

' income.”

Platt said he would work on
problems such as student aid,
invoice red-tape, landlords, and
special student rates at Oakland
businesses.

"Action oriented research’ ’ was

' proposed by Platt as the solution to

many problems facing SGB; “We
need research to isolate the prob-
lem, document it, correlate the
data and then act on it,” he said.
-“We could approach instructors
of the number of research courses
on campusand get them to have
their students carry out research
that would help us in student
government. Then we have hard-
core data that we can approach the
proper people with,” he explained.
Platt charged the present-SGB
with “waiting for a crisis to hit
them in the face, and not dealing
with the day-to-day problems.”
He said the SGB should cease
inyolvement with the allocations
procedure after they have selected
the committee members. “It is
ludicrous to have the Board repli-
cate something they have appoint-
ed someone else to do,” he said‘.
Two further ideasrhe presented
were continuing the “constant
entertainment here at a low cost to
the student,” and possible SGB
loans to student groups who ‘need
money to begin fund-raising activi-
ties.

He said the workings of the SG'
Allocations Committee “could have

Board had a responsibility to work‘
towards rectifying the committee's
problems.

Early consideration for budgets of
Greek Week,‘ Homecoming, En-
gineers Week, Black Week, Com-
muter Week, and_ Women's Cul-
tural Festival, was proposed by
Keeler. “It would be simple to do
this and allow the six events to get
rolling long before they occur,” he
said. I‘ _

Keeler said he would try -for an
earlier time for SGB meetings and
a more accessible location to allow
more students to attend.

“Look back to see who was
involved and you will see that it
was me,” he said concerning his,
record on the present SGB.

He termed ‘the Undergraduate
Academic Review (UAR) one of his
main concerns and suggested
changing the UAR format and
surveying students outside the’
classroom to bypass faculty veto
rights. - .

Keeler said he has time to devote
to the presidency and spent more
time than any other Board member

said of the" administration.

He pledged to work for better
student involvement in the SGB
and a wider student turn-out for the

“It isn’t the fault of the students
but of the people that lead them.

 aware of such deadlines. CAS makes no formal attempt to

One such solution would involve notifying students by mail sometime

call this prejudice since the black

The Dragon’s Last Stand    

BYMATTHEW KENNEDY
Dragons: ‘
Where are the dragons of
yesteryear?

Contrary to popular belief, they
are still with us, as popular as ever,
thriving in backwoods and sewers,
a living monument to nature’s
cleverness in preservation.

At one time Dragons lived in
Europe. They were discovered by
monks simultaneously in Haps-
burg, London and Rome in what
some have termed the “spring” of
the year.

Large and shy, the hundreds of
sightings eventually dwindled until
ﬁnally the last sighting of a Dragon
was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicles about 1000 years ago.’

There. is evidence that Lief
Erickson’ colonized the North
Americas with Dragons when the
stout Vikings and their dragonships
beached near New -Jersey. They
left later, but the Dragons stayed.
At present, America’s embattled
population of Dragons havebeen
decimated by the use of pesticides,
and frequent collisions with 747’s
as male Dragons, blinded by. Raid,
attempt to mate with the giant jet
liners. ‘

The numbers of young Dragons
have beencut into by a nefarious
blackmarket dealing in Dragon's
eggs, which are used in the
preparation of Eternal Life Potions
and Teflon 11.

Large numbers have also fallen
prey to outraged suburbanites who
wildly open_ ﬁre when a Dragon
passing overhead causes interfer-
ence on television sets and
Mixmasters. Some have claimed

that the Great Blackout in New
York was caused by an unusually
dense group of Dragons ﬂying to

 Gloss to the hrlnk

  New World Majarityat UN

BY TOM WASELESKI
Now that the shoe, is on the other
foot the United States doesn’t like
the ﬁt. 1

The recent votes by the United
Nations (UN) to recognize the
Palestinian Liberation Organization
as a coherent national body have .
become the sources of concern for
Western democracy. '

In the terribly lopsided tallies of
89-8 and 95-17, the UN General
Assembly ‘passed measures that, 
respectively, “reafﬁrms the inali-
enable rights, of the Palestinian
people” and ‘-‘considers’ that the
Palestinian Liberation Organization
is entitled to participate as an _
observer in the sessions and the

"work of ‘all international confer-

ences convened under the auspices
of the United Nations.”

Amid cries of anti-Israel man-
euvering and communist master
plans, the speculation arises that’

the Jewish people may consider '

withdrawal from the world body.

The United States, whose un-'
shakeable support is given to the

Israelis without question and

without holding them to .account,

now charges the peacekeeping

body with shabbiness and nation-

alistic motivation.

Nevertheless, there is a new

reality, a new majority at the

United Nations that must be faced
up to. This new grouping, or bloc,
if you will, reflects the ideological
apportionment throughout the
world, which is the way it should
be. It will take some time for the ,

_ West to adjust to its new minority
;_ position. ' - '
‘ ,g The main act of t_hi’s« current

 

. majority,

_ 'I_‘he‘point' is, what does, the'Unite‘d

   

the Bahamas on a get-away
weekend. '

But beyond this sketchy history,
just who is the average Dragon?

Well, authorities differ in their
opinions, mostly because no one
has seen one for about a thousand
years. But most experts concur the
Dragon’ on the street is a
conservative, would like to see a
tax-cut for the middle class and has
at least $1,000 in the bank.

The favorite comedian of Dragons
nation-wide is Red Skelton, al-
though there is a strong following
for Gerald Ford. ‘

Most Dragons never attended
grade school, as there are few
buildings which could handle the
playful Dragon-tots when they get
frisky, and -corporal punishment is
out of the question unless teachers
could be outﬁtted with bazookas.

At one time the Dragon was under
consideration for the animal on our
national seal, along with the
turkey, the guttersnipe and the
octopus. The eagle faction won out,
as you may recall, but large
numbers of Dragon-supporters still
linger on in a special committee of
the Democratic Party.

Now, you might ask [indeed you .

might] ,“where ‘can I see one of
these, awesome and majestic
creatures where I live?”
listen closely, it won’t be easy
because, threatened on all sides,
most Dragons have» gone under
ground. 4

For instance one species of
Dragon has developed distinct

markings which cleverly mimic the

Goodyear blimp. I’ll bet you’ve‘
beenwondering how it could‘ be
over your city and over Detroit at
the same time, huh? I , I '

Some have adapted scale-coats
which make them indistinguishable

performance of modern insanity is

-not the Arab-Israeli question, but

the deep misgivings and overriding
sense of failure that America is now
beset with. ' '

How is it that in following, paths
for the greater glory of man this
country has lost its following of

men and women? How is it that in I

aiding the ﬁght for freedom, truth,
and international justice, the
United States finds itself unjustly
“ganged up” on at the UN?

Something needs to be said about
the American sense of what is good
for the world. All this writer can
put forth is that what America saw
as good for the world was not what
the world saw as good for the
world. ’

And so the United Nations, which
has been entrusted with the
welfare of the international com-
munity, is starkly revealed in all its
nationalist special interests.

In the American media, the recent
UN sessions have been colored as a
ruthless program by the Arabs that
will bring about the extinction of
Israel; but others like myself see
the votes in a much broader sense,
as the ﬁrst signs of a new wave of

the future. "In plain words, the_

lock-up that the United States had
on the world no longer exists.
Whether this is for good or evil is

‘no longer the point. The new
Communist-Arab-. '

the
Third World bloc, i firm, and with
their ever-increasing membership
will become ﬁrmer. They are a
group to be reckoned with, just as
the US bloc had to be reckoned
with. -

from Greyhound buses and Volks-
wagen campers.

The easiest way to actually see a

Dragon up close is lay a bait and
camera trap for the critters.
Although traditionally Dragons
have preferred virgins, you can
substitute a- bacon-lettuce and

tomato sandwich ancksave your self

problems with the Vice Squad.
The sandwich should be large,

' about the size of a 10-ton semi,

with a large olive stuck in the top

with a giant toothpick festively '

garnished with those little cello-
phane things they use on top
nowadays. _ .
Most Dragons prefer the early
morning hours, so set it out around
midnight, stake yourself behind a
tree, and wait.
In no time at all you’ll see 
that a Greyhound bus, or _
Goodyear blimp?  something big
- sneaking up on tiptoe.
That is your Dragon. ‘ ..
Don’t fall into. the habit of
repeating this little trick too often,
or you’ll ‘have a house-Dragon
on your hands, and the Animal
Rescue League can be very difficult
about handling these scaley bug-
gers. ‘

So there you’ll -have it,‘ proof

is
a

. .2.-g

positive that the Dragon does exist. ‘

Cherish this moment because as
clouds of pesticides rise from our
cities and farms and 747’s infest

' our sky, you’ll be seeing a lot less

of them. ‘

Write your congressman, senator
or bookieand call for affirmative
federal action to 'save this
wonderful, cute and whimsical

.« ‘ p

beast from extinction. Do it today. A

Tomorrow may see the , Dragon
gone from this planet forever, and

then; who knows? Perhaps the ‘-

' unicorn!

States intend to do "now -- now that
it has been rejected as the world’s
moral leader. Apparently, some-
thing went wrong in the past 30

years that Americans refuse to live ’

up to. There was something that
underdeveloped nations, the
downtrodden peons of this capito-
imperialist era, rejected in the
giant of the West. ,

Perhaps, the third‘ world was not
about to accept the justice of a
.CIA-overthrown Allende, or the
human beneﬁt of a Bay of Pigs
invasion, or the truth of the
Cambodian incursion.

Not one nation at the UN table has
the right to point the ﬁnger,
includingand especially the United

States. Had the_ moral leadership of '
‘America been truly moral, the

democratic father ﬁgure. would,

' ‘never have been deposed.
' But now, in view of the recent turn

of events, it is clear that the US has
sacrificed its great international
following in favor of that which
turned so many against it: the great
wealth sapped from the third
world. ‘

Let it never be said that either
side of the Arab-Israeli conflict is
more saintly than the other, or,
likewise, that one is more
treacherous. Both have demon-
strated greed in their demands and
both have displayed wanton ag-
gression. I ‘ .

And in a tottering, unstable’
nuclear age, when day-to-day life is
at th_e~mercy of not one button, but
several, the territorial demands of
an over-zealous nation are simply
not worth the extinction "of all

Homecoming from the jurisdiction

Before 4’ implementation the plan

According to the Pittsburgh
77 branch of the ‘American Civil
Liberties" Union (ACLU), 1/68 of
'1 ‘the military deserters and draft
evaders eligible for the program
have reported.
7 Draft evaders are to report to the
(7. US Attorney's office. By. mid-Dec-
ii ember, 92 evaders had volunteered
f , ‘out ofa total 6,600. This is 1.5% of
 those eligible.
 Some evaders are in the situation,
"I, ,tor example, of a person applying
< A for conscientious objector status
 who deserves it, but who fails to
receive it and evades the draft.
‘The ACLU charges draft boards
A" with a lack of in depth examina-
‘ ._tion in making these decisions.
in the Pittsburgh district, US
, Attorney Richard Thronburgh’s of-
" -fice refuses to accept an evader not
 represented by legal counsel. A

and reported, after which they have
13 days to comply with the Presi-
7' dent's clemency program. Once in
— this country, they are prevented
_ -- from returning to Canada. _

_— ‘ Draft evaders and military desert-

A ers in exile are estimated at 30,000
U ..to 40,000, most of them in Canada.
 Many entered that country as
‘P tourists and have remained beyond
' ‘the expiration of their permits.
-".While Canadian authorities will not
_ ‘deport or extradite any American

7 charged with violation of the draft

. Evaders in Canada cannot enter

law or desertion, they are “illegal"
and cannot hold jobs.

Military deserters must report to
Camp Atterbury in Indiana for
processing. Prior to this, they were
in exile abroad, living underground
in this country, or imprisoned. By
niid-Deceniber 1,315 deserters vol-
to conscientious objectors, such as
in hospitals or in Appalachia.

The ACLU has favored the estab-
lishment of total unconditional
amnesty, but has been offering
legal counsel to men eligible under
President 1-‘ord’s clemency pro-
gram. The President’s program
applies to those affected between
August 4, 1904 and March 28,
1973.

Deserters and draft evaders after
reporting mustvsign a statement
requiring that the person waive
certain constitutional rights, such
as the right to due process or'a
speedy trial in violation of the
agreement and the protection a-
gainst double jeopardy. While the

evaders and military deserters, the
length of alternative service is up to
two years or less as decided by the
US Attorney. Place of service is
determined by the selective service
coniniission. This entails alternate
service of the same kind delegated

Uiie problem confronting the

 

ACLU in assisting these men is the
lack of a known number of those
who qualify for clemency in specific
areas of the country.

One group not considered under
the President’s plan is the less-
than-honorably discharged. They
are estimated by. the ACLU at
470,000 to 500,000. They all carry
severe disabilities, including loss of
veterans benefits, disqualifications
for civil service and other employ-
ment, and disability to obtain
licenses. ‘

lhe ACLU is enlisting the aid of
lawyers experienced in draft cases,
law students to prepare cases, and
other volunteers to assist in keep-
ing up to date on legislation and

program. As always, it demands a

coalition of individuals to perform i

this service and the ACLU is
looking for volunteers. Their office

W YEP: “l.istener’s Radio”

BY PAUL MAZUR

WYEP is Pittsburgh's “listener
access" radio station, a station free
to the people.

Housed in the basement of a
warehouse in Oakland, the station
offers a variety of programs reﬂect-
ing the different views and cultures
in Pittsburgh.

WYEP is wholly a people's radio
station. Joe Coluccio, Program
Director of WYEP, said, “If some-
one has an idea for a program, he
can come down to us and present it.

if it is a feasible idea, we'll try to
fit it into the programming.”

Station members are volunteers.
“We‘ve not been able to search
people out," Coluccio said. The
people who work here just camein
and talked to us." - .

WYEP wants to get Pittsburghers
involved in radio, Coluccio explain-
ed. “Participant excitement is a
problem sometimes,” he . said.
“Right now we're trying to get
ethnic programming.

"For example, a guy came in to do

Slavic programming‘. He told me
that there were some big differ-
ences between each Slavic group,
that each‘ group has a distinct
cultural heritage. He wantedto be

in charge of the programming to '

balance off the program among the
different Slavic groups._

“We're trying to get people to
show their heritage and culture,”
Coluccio said. "But we don't want
to start any conflict between ethnic
groups."

The programming of WYEP re-
tlects community participation.

Such people as the blind and the’

United Farm Workers are‘ repre-
sented with their own programs
and jazz and soul music programs
are hosted by volunteers.

Since it is acommunity radio
station, WYEP receives no funding
from conim’ercial advertising re-
venue. Accepting commercial ad-
vertisements would entail some
kind of control by the sponsors,

station members feel.
funding is generated by a grant
from the Corporation of Public
Broadcasting.

“Advertising our station is also a
problem," Coluccio said.
going to get buscards, public
service announcements on televi-
sion and maybe a few TV spot
aniiouncenients," he said.

But transforming an auto-body
shop into a radio station is no easy
matter, especially when the work
must be done by volunteers.

“Many of the people who come
down here want air time," Coluccio
said, “but no one wants building."

The situation is improving how-
ever and gains are gradually being
made in the renovation of the
basement radio station.

"Anyway, part of the fun of
working here," Coluccio said, “is
when you don’t know something
and you have to find out how to go
about doing it.” . ‘

Not all the Christmastime goodies
are left under the tree.

The ho-ho-ho season is ﬁlmdom’s
biggest splash, with the cream of
the box office crop hitting a
holiday-cheered populace armed
with Christmas cash and free time
to spend in movie theatres. Also,
not incidentally,’ this is the season

, just before the Academy Awards

deadline. Those ﬂicks getting just

under the time wire are freshest in

the minds of Academy voters, thus

creating a greater impact and a

_ better chance to cop those coveted
 golden idols.

‘Tis the season to be jolly.

The studios really pull out all the
stops for the Christmas product,
starting their promotional cam-
paigns well in advance of release
(not unlike the Christmas toy
manufacturers).

Deﬁnitely the best promo cam-
paign was for the dual studio
production of The Towering Infer-

you were getting ‘ tired of one
disaster after another polluting the
screen with sunken ships, burst

was hard not to get curiousabout

 ., Inferno. All those stars, that crew,
\ that budget. Just seeing 49 of the

57 sets destroyed for the camera

had to be worth something, right?

Well, it’s certainly easy to put
down a ﬁlm that is ﬁlled with every

,, old formula used since’ the Muses
inspired the ﬁrst epic poems, with
one-dimensional glamorous Holly-
wood-type characters, with dia-

 logue that never rises past soap
opera level. Right?

But in spite of it all, it’s a fun film
to watch. True, it has all the
intellectual stimulation of a comic
book, but who says comic books are
inherently bad? Inferno is terrific
entertainment on a grand scale
rarely attained by the tight

economy of modern Hollywood..

True, all the people are glamorous,
but who wants to watch everyday

I people? And the sets and costumes
are just too much, but then why he
mundane? It’s refreshing to see a
little extravagance now -and then
from a Hollywood that has been too
busy beinginexpensively boring of
late.

Inferno, in case you somehow

ARTS-& ENTERTAINMENTEDTFOR.

Standing on your head while reading a book tends to distract from the

‘ written art form. Playing a game of football with a ping-pong ball in

front of a crowd composed of rotting corpses certainly eliminates much
of what creates the attractiveness of the sport. So is the same with
butterless toast, ﬂat beer, pink blue-jeans and a lot of the new theatres
being built.

Yeah, it’s the last one that bugs me.

I’m sure by now that all of us have run into one of these set-ups where
four movies are being shown in four separate theatres under one roof
with one common box office. Now, in many ways the idea is a sweet one
and if the majority of today's ﬁlms were decent, it would be a fantastic
concept. But today’s ﬁlms aren’t so hot and itseems to me that there’s'
quite a few major blunders involved in the whole idea.

Of course maybe my criticism is a matter of jealousy. After all, I’m
sure the theatres are a ﬁnancial success and since I’m not reaping any
of the ﬁnancial beneﬁts, I’m of course poor as ever and twice as pissed
off. In fact, if my imagination had been capable of recognizing the
tasteless stupidity of your basic commercial ﬁlm buff, I would have
stuck 20 or 30 theatres under one roof and jammed it full of trash such
as Freebie and the Bean, The Towering Inferno and The Great
Gatsby...damn, another capitalistic dream washed down the drain of

laziness. . . -

But really, what’s wrong with these cheesy’ piles of cement blocks is
their inability to create a proper atmosphere, not to mention their
depressing impressions on one whose idealism is further deﬂated each
day by neon signs and plastic garbage cans. '

First of all, when you enter one of these places, you know immediately
that they’re only after your money. Of course they are...but the least
they could do is attempt to hide the fact a bit. Like get rid of the blatant.
showing of the cheapest, dullest excuses for furnishings and supposed
attractive decor. All in all, it’s like having a literature or theatre course
in Benedum Hall, a lifeless building always worth despising.

So you’re three bucks poorer and sitting in this characterless block

' called a theatre and somebody somewhere believes that everything’s

just right for you to experience a supposed art experience.

Well, I’m not such a believer. In fact, I’d rather be stuck in a grand
old theatre of the 20’s or 30’s or even a living room plus television. But
further plasticity and gaudiness?...never. .

  Golden Gun Re view

The lust for ruthless, absolute
power to control people’s lives

* dominates the muchpublicized and

long awaited movie, The Man With
the Golden Gun. The lust for power
is acquired on a grandeur scare in

. this, the‘ ninth James Bond ﬁlm.

This time, Bond (Roger Moore)
battles with the professional
assassin Scaramanga (played by
Lee, star of the
Dracula series) as Bond tries to

capture a missing Solex Agitator -- ‘A
the solution "to the world’s'energy

\

problem. The device, in the hands ,

of Scaramanga, harnesses enough

'- _ solar energy to meet the world's
rising energy demand. The Solex‘

Agitator can be used for good or
bad purposes and Scaramanga
hopes to sell it to the highest bidder
at an exorbitant price _

Scara'manga’s price per killing is a
million dollars and because he
always uses a golden gun and
bullet, he is known‘ and feared
throughout the world of espionage
as “the man with the golden gun”
which he intends to use on Agent
_007. '

ror Bond's mission, he is assisted
by foxy Mary Goodnight (Britt
Ekland) and, quite unexpectedly,
by the ignorant, prejudiced and
redneck Louisianna sheriff J.iW.

The picture is well made but lacks
the iinnovativeness of previous
Bond -ﬁlms. To ‘date, it is the

‘weakest one. The problem is there

is nothing new or original done in
this ﬁlm. Every gimmick used in

the movie was better utilized in the ’

other ‘Bond ﬁlms such as car

‘V 4* J

chases, laser guns, underground

laboratories and even blackmail.

Perhaps. Guy Hamilton, the direc- ’

tor of three other Bond movies, has
been soaked dry for creativeness
and imagination.

Moore is good as the cool and
dynamic secret agent and Lee is
equally as effective as a well

organized perfectionist. Again, as . A

usual, are the familiar faces of M,
Bond’s chief (he’s crabbier), Q, the
equipment chief, (still full of pride
for his inventions) and Miss
Moneypenny, M’s secretary, who
is still trying since 1962 to ‘achieve

her minimal objective -- a date with A

Bond -- that’s perseverance!

To those who have a lust for Band
ﬁlms, The Man With the Golden
Gun should satisfy your appetite.

Bats Run To 0Y0

 BY RICK STOUFFER
Christmastime is usually a time of
rest for most of us, a time to take it
easy and indulge in a little “Christ-
T mas cheer." Nothing to do but sit
back and relax.
lt’s funny the members of the Pitt
track squad couldn’t take it easy
but instead practiced long hours
,....._.,---getting ready for the first meet of
 the 1975 indoor track season,
namely to the CYO lnvitational to
be held tonight at the University of

Maryland. ‘

lhe CYU has grown in recent

' years to become one of the prestige

events of the track season drawing
in outstanding talent.-

“We‘re only able to take our two
mile relay team to the invitation-

""' ‘ said head coach Jim Banner.

,,'',1 ‘all,’
"lhe trouble is with the growth of
so many track clubs over the past
years the collegians can only
quality for events like the two
mile." 6

Meet directors are naturally busi-
nessmen first and when‘-it comes to
drawing power, ie. money, world
class competitors like Rick W0hl-
muter attract more people than a
Pitt runner.

Banner is counting on a veteran

lull-you-to-sleep-destroy-you -
Chuck Mozingo, Don Betterly, who
had an outstanding year "as a
freshman, and the always smiling
Rich Markley.

"The team ha-s looked very good
in practice but regardless it’s only
the opening meet of the season and
there is still a long way to go before
the NCAA's in.March." 8

As far as predictions‘ for the rest of
the season Banner pleaded the ﬁfth
amendment but he did admit being
pleased with the recruitment pro-
gram.

“We have a talented group of
freshmen this year. Guys like
Keith Taylor, Mel Boyd, and Tom
Herman give us probably more
depth and balance overall than we
have had for a long time.

“Bob Arthur is only a freshman‘
putting the shot who is going to be
a good one in a short time,"
Banner continued. “lt might even
happen this year.”

A long with the great recruiting

little through graduation.

lhe Pitt basketball team just
keeps rolling up those victories, but
only at home. The Cats defeated
ioungstown State on Wednesday
night to run their current home
winning streak to 18 games and
bring their season’s mark to 5-6.

All the wins are at home where the '

Cats are playing like one of the
l:ast's top teams.

But the Pitt squad seems to lose
something when they play on an
alien floor. They haven’t played
badly in their six losses and could
easily have been 9-2 at this point.
Perhaps the first road win is the
toughest to get but, fortunately for
them, they play Bucknell on the
road tomorrow.

"Our runners have been in the top
five for the last three years in the

year we were fourth in the nation at
the CYU. .We’ve been grouped
with powerhouses Villanova, Neb-
raska, and Florida so we have our

Forgetting all those holiday prac-

Ilold Own It PSI! «

Frifiav. January 10,197; -—THE Prr'r ‘NEws;pa9,' 9 

Punihrs me To Win On Road 

lhe Bisons are just what the
doctor ordered to treat a sagging
roadrecord. They currently hold a
record of .3-6 with wins over such
powers as Gettysburg, Rochester,
and Colgate. Their losses have
been to Penn State, South Carolina
Rider, Seton Hall, Bloomsburg,
and St. Francis of Brooklyn.

The Cats are truly heavy fa-
vorites to even their record at 6-6,
but the way they have played up till
now, anything could happen.
However, the Bisons have not won
at home yet this year even though
their dimly lit court gives them an
advantage over visiting opponents.

The Panthers are a potentially

explosive group which was evident g

on Wednesday night against the
Penguins. The game was a dismal
display with both teams commit-
ting a total of 44 personal fouls.
But , the Pens were no match for
the Cats who put together a
balanced offensive attack as they
rolled up the 88-62 victory.

. Pitt shot 47% from the ﬁeld as
four players reached double ﬁgures
despite their limited playing time.
Keith Starr scored a game high 19
points as he ran the fast break to
perfection with some valuable as-
sistance from Kirk Bruce who
finished with 18, and Tom Richards
who netted 12.

l—reshman Larry Harris put on quite
a display of his own scoring 15
points, pulling down 10 rebounds,
blocking two shots, and forcing
several turnovers. it was the best
performance of the season for
Harris who is improving rapidly
alter receiving priceless experience
against top-notch opponents.

On the other hand, Bucknell isn't
exactly setting any scoring records.
1 The top scorer for the Bisons is
Jerry Purnell who is averaging 16
points per game. The only other
Bucknell player averaging in dou-
ble figures is Sam Stettler who
currently has a 14.4 point average. '

But the Bisons are a very young
and inexperienced team and head
coach Jim Valvano likes to give all
his players a chance to see action.

The victory over Youngstown
marked the 300th career victory for
Buzz Ridl a milestone
coaches life. Hopefully the Cats
will be able to build upon Ridl's
(already) impressive credentials
throughout the remainder of the
season, and a win tomorrow is
essential to this goal.

The current season is nearly half

over so the Cats must come on_ .

strong in order to gain a spotnin the
post-season ECAC Southern Divi-
_sion tournament. ‘

lliey will start a four-game home
stand next Monday against Notre
Dame which, through a possible

300 Career Wins

BY JIM SPANOS
There was neither the thrill of
victory, nor the agony of defeat for

‘the Pitt gymnastics team at Penn

State Wednesday night. The
Panthers confronted a giant in
collegiate gymnastics, and al-
though they were defeated by a
score of 202-162, nobody on the
team felt any agony.

Most assuredly, there was disap-
pointment. Disappointment be-
cause the Panthers
sporadically on the pommel horse;
accumulating only 20 points as a
team in that particular event.

Disappointment for Mark Boyette,

the lone senior on the squad, who _

didn’t perform on the ﬂoor exercise
because of an injury he sustained in

  

performed ,

warmups.

Disappointment in the minds of
most of the Pitt gymnasts; a feeling
that if they had another chance,
they could do better.

But in gymnastics, one is not
given a second chance. If there is
one modus operandi that a gymnast
must deal with, it is the factthat he
has only one opportunity to excel.
That opportunity vanishes rapidly.

The brightest event of the evening
for Pitt was in the vaulting
competition, in which specialist

in any ‘

Don Nixon scored 7.65, specialist
Tim Rand scored 8.7, and
all-around men Don Stevenson and
Rob Pasterickscored 8.75 and 8.8
respectively.

On the high bar, Penn State, P‘
paced by a brilliant 9.3 perfor-
mance by senior Steve Bisal,
outscored the Panthers 34-26. The
best performance on the bar for Pitt
was executed by sophomore
captain Pasterick, whom the judges
awarded a score of 8.15.

Pasterick also led the Panthers on

crew to take the laurels at Mary-
land. The groups consists of a

for an extra burst of speed), the

inconsistency so- far-'-this season. .
W-Skip Bolin,‘ who decisioned his
Temple"opp‘_onen‘t 11-3, will have
his hands full ‘ "with yet" another_
defending Eastern champion, Dan
Muthler. Muthler, at 150, won the
Eastern title at 142 last year, and
two years ago was NCAA champion
in the 142 class. Bolin, a freshman,
will have to overcome Muthler’s
experience or his own lack of it to
win that bout. ~ ' ‘
Adams will be using -three
freshmen, including Bolin, in
tomorrow night’s match. Bill
Bailey, who pinned Rich Acierno of
Temple, and Kevin Nellis, who
.decisioned his Temple foe, will feel

the. pressure when they face off,

against the tough midshipmen,
ranked third in the East, and
twelfth preseason nationally.

“It's a tough challenge for

P everyone,” says Adams‘, ‘_‘but this s
is the kind of challenge that the ‘

te‘am'is looking for, that they’ve
been working for. Because of that

this is going to be a close‘ ‘A

knock-em-down, drag-em-out
match.” _‘

If Pitt is going to capitalize in the
lower weights, Rande Stottlemyer
will also have to come through for
his teammates when he faces Tom
Bauer. Stottlemyer is 1-0‘after a
decision over Ty Hamilton of
Temple. Stottlemyer and- Bryant
are Pitt’s “big guns” as Dave
Adams likes to call them, and if
both of them don’t come through, it
will be, a long night for the
Panthers. - l

The Panther grapplers will also

. ’ look to John “Bimbo” Chatman for

leadership. Chatman pinned Tem-

,'ple’s Joe Russo to improve his

overall record at Pitt to 23-4-1.
Chatman will face either Larry
Fleischer or Bobb Kenny at 167
lbs. arid a win at this weight could
be very crucial. '

In fact, every match will be a
crucial one for the Panthers. Carl

On thefree exercise, Penn -State’s

“We have a very balanced team.

We have a great squad of divers in

looking for the Bisons to prevail.

"Un paper, they are four points
