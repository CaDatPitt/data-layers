J Finals Time Found Too Short

(This is the second in a ser-
ies of three features dealing
with faculty opinion about
ﬁnals’ week.)

‘By NANCY DELANEY
“Never! A b o 1 i s h ﬁnals’

like the one week exam
period — but it's better than
no weeks at all. Two weeks
would be even better.” This
was the reaction of a small num-
ber of faculty members diametri-
cally opposed to the anti-ﬁnals’
week opinion reported last week.

The realhazard of a one week
final examination period, and es-
pecially of no ﬁnal period, accord-
ing to Dr. Holbert N. Carroll,
chairman "of the political science
department, is that reviews and
ﬁnal tests are squeezed together
into too short a time.

Also, the quality of a course
and of student performance suf-
fers in a one, or even two hour
ﬁnal. Dr. Carroll would prefer
three hours for each ,
amination, which would’ entail
lengthening the ﬁnal exam period
at the expense of class time.

Cut Vacation?

To solve this problem of ex-
tending the ﬁnals’ week period
preserving valuable
class time, some faculty members,
such as Dr. Frederick J. Gottleib,
instructor in zoology, suggest cut-
ting into the August vacation for
the extra days to" add to each
trimester.

Dr. Carroll and Dr. Philip
,Koch, associate professor of
French, do not even consider
this a. problem, however.. They
feel that even a twelve week
term is long enough for a pro-
fessor to convey all the neces-
sary lecture material.

In fact, both Dr. Carroll and
Dr. Koch would like to adopt a
program similar to the one used
in which only ap-
proximately eleven weeks of the
ﬁfteen week term would be de-
voted to class time. Under this
plan, two weeks at the end of the
term could be spent by the stu-
dent synthesizing his knowledge
and doing outside reading before
the two week ﬁnal exam period.

Such a program, according to

Dr. Koch, would give thestudent

time to “think, organize, and re-

Dr. Koch and Dr. Carroll sup-.
port this .plan because they
favor looking upon the tri-
mester as a “total educational
experience,” which includes not
just “being lectured to,” but
also reading‘ independently and
taking examinations.

Men’s Council seems to be in the identical position in

»which Student Government found .itself over a year ago
A before Tom Olofson took ofﬁce..It is a discredited organiza-

tion with an entire year of total impotency gnawing at its
conscience, and like SG, it has recently acquired a new
staff of oﬁicers.

— Whether Men’s Council, however, can pull another Tom
Olofson out of its grab bag of willing workers is rather a

difficult question to answer. It has a candidate, however,
,and Jerry Epstein seems at least as dedicated as Olofson

was when he started. .

I However, Olofson at least had the impressive name of
SG to work with. Epstein has nothing. Very few people
have ever even heard of Men’s Council let alone know what
it does — or what it is supposed to do. In fact, last year we
seemed to" have been able to get along without any MC
whatever and many people seem quite willing to do the

.. same this year.

A Under these circumstances, it is going to be rather
interesting to sit back and watch MC either develop or
completely disintegrate. The group needs another Tom’ Olof-
son and. people like him are just about as rare as successful
Men’s -Council projects.

Repercussions

Being a Jew in Alabama is almost as bad as being a
Roman Catholic or a Negro, and Rabbi Rubenstein and 18
of his colleagues took a big chance by their ﬁve day jaunt
last week in riot-torn Birmingham. \

Admittedly, they ﬂew south with the best of intentions
in mind and quite possibly, “the emotional ra1lies” which

“the rabbis staged during their visit ,may have helped to

calm down some of the more violence-minded Negroes. Once,
however, the immediate trouble simmers to its usual hot
sizzle what will be the real effect of their action. '

In Southern white eyes the rabbis have quite clearly
alligned themselves with the “niggers” and their efforts on
behalf of racial freedom may boomerang in the faces of the
few Jewish people living in and around Birmingham.

A’, person who sincerely believes that a colored man
sitting at the other end of a lunch counter taints the food
whichghe is eating is not likely to look with favor upon the
peaceful actions of a group of dedicated rabbis to avoid
bloodshed in a race riot, and he may try to take out his

, displeasure on those unfortunate Jewish people living in his

vicinity.

Poor Teachers--Part Three .

Aiding All Teachers

yr
.0

There are many ways in which an individual
may gauge how effectively he is performing a
task. He may compare the results of his per-
formance with the results which were supposed
to occur, he may turn to the
person who has assigned him
the task and. ask for an esti-
mate of his effectiveness’, or he
may e1icit,a response from the
material with which he is
working.

For the college instructor,
gauging one’s effectiveness -‘can
take the above shapes. He may
decide that, for his instruction
to have been effective, students’_

. tests grades should describe the
béll—shaped or normal curve, that their essays and
class discussions ‘should demonstrate comprehen-
sion of the ideas offered in class and .show
imaginative ‘exploration of these ideas, or that
he, at the end of the trimester, should have ‘ﬁnish-

 

« ed presenting the lecture and discussion material

he had planned to present. Without questioning
the validity of these gauges, let us recognize that
they are among those used by instructors. Here,
the instructor has decided that, if a certain cri-
terion is being met, a criterion which he has
previously set, then his teaching is effective.

Keeping Tabs

- Various administrators keep tabs on instructors
and, in .a well-administered educational institu-
tion, are quick to help them improve their ‘teach-
ing or keep it up to par. Here, the person who has

assigned the "instructor his task estimates his

effectiveness;

These two methods offer two viewpoints of an
instructor’s e1fectiven'ess.’The last way in which
an individual can gauge his effectiveness —-— elicit-
ing a response from the material with ‘which he
is working — is available to those instructors who
view the job of providing opportunity for learn-

, ing as something more than feeding information

to students and evaluating their efforts at mem-
orizing this information and spewing it back.
They can ask their students: How am I doing?

Washington In Spring . . :

By Barry Gross

They can ask this question, not because it will
make students feel important or give them an
opportunity to blow off steam rather than to
complain to an administrator, but because,
ideally, both instructors and students want the
learping process to work.

Some instructors at the University p_ass out
course evaluation sheets to their students at the
end of the trimester to be returned signed or un-
signed. Most of these evaluation sheets concen-
trate on some basic questions. Usually" included
are: Was the text material and lecture material

too easy oritoo hard? Was there too muchor too

little of it? Did‘ tests seem fair?
The answers to these and other questions pri-

marily would be of value to th‘e instructor of a ‘

large class who does not have the opportunity for
enough personal contact with the members of his
classes to be able to gauge their feelings on
these matters. -Theseare questions which must
be asked every year or every trimester.

Cannot Prepare Permanent Method

I do_not believe that an instructor can‘ prepare
a method of teaching and use this method from
year to year. I do not believe that lecture‘ notes
can be utilized year after year with no revisions.
The good instructor should be constantly study-
ing the subject he teaches, ﬁnding new informa-

tion and new insights which he should utilize in ,

his lectures. As this information which he wishes
to present alters, the texts he uses and the tests
he gives must change also. This is reason enough
for a teacher to periodically gauge the effective-
ness "of his instruction. ‘

Presently it is up to the instructors at this
University as to whether or not they utilize
course evaluation‘ sheets. Three years» ago, the
question of the sheets was discussed by the Lib-
eral Arts Cabinet, according to 'Albert B.
Martin, dean of the School of Liberal’Arts.

I do not believe that any teacher should be
forced to» distribute course evaluation sheets and
to accept their information, butl do believe that
they can be an asset to both instructors and
students.

States: ‘in its climate, its mood, and its upside-
down work schedule. When I stepped stiffly out

of the car after ﬁve hours on the road I" was
greeted with snow flurries in
my face. Yes, sunny Washing-
ton celebrated its May Day
with chilling temperatures and
gusty winds. I can’t say I was
uphappy about the cold air, be-
cause I had been forewarned’
from countless world-travelers‘
‘that spring and summer in

Washington "were equivalent
only to the hottest spots on the ,
Equator. The termthey used
was “miserable.” Well, it was _
miserable, all right, but a pleasing sort of miserable
to someone with two wool jackets in the suitcase.
Five days later the temperature was 97 and the
humidity was around 85 ‘per cent. “This _is
NOTHING! Wait’ll JULY!” I was told, and" it
appeared that I wasn’t going to be denied a full,
authentic, and simply capital summer.

Pittsburgh, which long ago opted for the small-

of towering skyscrapers‘ or the clockwork pre-
cision of the pedestrians -—*Washington lacks that

 Jerry Whalen Heads ]llen’s Housing

\4‘

By LARRY BERNFELD

Jerry Whalen, as head res-
ident of Schenley Hall in
1960, became the proud reci-
pient of a University record.
Mrs. Whalen gave birth to
the “ﬁrst resident adminis-
trative birth in the history of
the University.”

But young “wailin’ Whalen”
of the ﬁfth ﬂoor Schenley was

. only the ﬁrst in a series of major

events in the senior Whalen’s
three years on the administra-
tive staff. -

The following year Whalen

received his appoimment as Di-

It's easy ‘to borrowlat-Union National Bank. it usually takes us only 24 hours or less to process
and approve your loan‘. Come in today, and pick up your money-tomorrow, Maybe this
the year you should take that special "v

rector of Men’s Housing and As-
sistant to the Dean of Men. The
construction of the new men’s
dormitories has greatly increased
the duties of the Housing Direc-

tor. These three white cylindri-
cal towers, which will reach
completion on July 27, have

caused many questions to come;

to Whalen’s ofﬁce.

Whalen would like the dorms
to have a woman social direc-
tress. He feels that “she will add
something to the area . . . It’s
good to have a woman around
. . . does something for the men.
In my experience they are more.
qualiﬁed in social programming.”

, Role Playing

The students will play a
larger role in the planning of
social events..Thereo will be a
large reception room and lounge
on every third floor. With these
increased facilities, the dorms
will play a greater role in a
student’s college life. “Soon al-
most all students will want to
spend at least one trimester on
campus.” H -

Whalen has replied’ to the
queries about the blank, white
wall on the Forbes Avenue
entrance of the dormitories.
He stated that the wall is not
a ﬁnished product. Ferns, trees

. and a patio area enclosed by a
safety_ guard rail will adorn
the top of the wall. Basically,
however, the wall serves as “a
support of the elevation level
of the entire complex,”
Whalen said.

Though the wall may look out
of place now, it will blend in
nicely with the future redevel-
opment of the whole Oakland
area, according to Whalen. “Vis-
iting students might mark it up,
but not the mature students of
Pitt.”

Heavy Traffic

The men’s housing center will
be connected with the quad-
rangle by a series of steps. These
steps will see heavy, traffic, as
the new cafeteria is in one of the
towers. The most impressive
View of the dorm complex will
be the Fifth Avenue entrance,

' not as- yet completed.

. One important objective of
they new housing set-up is to
stimulate interaction between
students and professors on in-
formal occasions. “Not only
does this relationship give the
student the beneﬁt of the pro-
fessors’ experience in college
life, but also aids the total
effectiveness of the professor
himself.” ‘

Whalen received his B.A. and
M.A. degree in English at Penn
State where he did his early ad-
ministrative-work. He came to

the University in 1960 to study
for his doctorate, and joined the
administrative staff the same
year.
Increase Effectiveness '

Whalen, who would like to
teach English in a small Liberal
Arts college after he receives his

Ph.D., feels that a professor can’t .

be an effective educator if he

increase a teacher’s effectiveness.
Whalen feels that he has
beneﬁted from his own stu-
dent personnel work. “It is re-
warding work . . . being able

' to transfer the beneﬁts of one’s

experience.”

Whalen, his wife and two
young sons no longer live on the
ﬁfth ﬂoor Schenley. Junior’s
crying apparently did not mix
well with calculus, chemistry,

Mitters Seek Revenge Against W. Va. 

 

Sage Remarks

By Bob Smizik

Sports Editor

Tennis Trouble

Talking with tenniscoach Ben Pope is as refreshing as
drinking a bottle of “Bud” after a two hour workout in the

dead of August. Pope must have been thrown out of the

— coaches union years ago, because he avoids the typical

coaches cliches like his team avoids winning matches..

In talking about his team,

which is 0-11, Pope says lit-

tle or nothing about lack of practice, strength of the oppo-

sition or the hardships of the trimester system. '
Instead he does not hesitate to say what’s rsally wrong.

‘‘There’s not enough real athletes on the team, Pope said.

“The only two good athletes we have are _Lar£y and Dave

This leads to an even greater problem. ‘Pope is unable

Jack Waltz. “Waltz prefers
said Pope. “He said if those

' three schools folded, he’d come here.” Jack Waltz coming
to Pitt to play tennis would be like Paul Martha going to

Carnegie Tech to play football.
There’s no prospect near

Waltz’s ability on this year’s

team. “Our boys are all a little handicapped,” said Pope.
“They’re more or less beginners. They’ve. gotten over the .
first fringe of learning, but still lack experience. It takes
time to be a good tennis ‘player and our boys don’t have
that time. When they’re ﬁnished here they’re ready to be-
come respectable players, but that doesn’t help us.”

Pope is hoping for a win Saturday against a compara-

tively weak Penn State team.

There is not much chance in

the season ﬁnale against a strong Allegheny team. If the net-
ters lost the next two it would be quite a distinction for Pitt.

How many schools have two

winlessteams in one season,

like Pitt does in golf and tennis?

Navy Submerges Track Team,

Navy beat the Panthers
track team at their own game
-— the ﬁeld events and the
hurdles — to post a lopsided

' ‘941/2-361/2 win over the Panth-
ers Saturday at Annapolis.

The Middies copped ten first

places including the pole vault
and the high and intermediate
hurdles —- events that usually are
wins for the Panthers.
Q Pitt winners were Al Tomassey
in the discus, John Bailey in the
mile, Larry Robinson in the two
mile, Vance Carter in the 880-
yard run and Bill DelVecchio in
the 220-yard dash.
Some Surprises

The wins by Thomassey and
DelVecchio were not surprises,
nor was Carter’s, even though he
ran the half mile for the ﬁrst
time this ‘year. The surprises were
Bailey's ﬁne time of 4:24.7 in the
mile and Robinson’s victory in the
two mile.

teams most consistent point-get-

three events he entered. He had
a jump of 6-feet in the high jump,
which was the winning jump, but
fell back to fourth because of his
missed attempts. Whiteford has
jumped 6—feet 3—inches this year.

Other point getters for the
Panthers were DelVecchio with
a second in the l00—yard dash,
Mike Slutsky, third in the 440-
yard dash, and Gary Meckley,
third in the pole vault.

Navy swept the high jump, the
shot put and the javelin throw.
They also placed two men in ev-
ery other event. The Panthers lack
of depth showed when they failed
to place more than one man in
any event.

°Baseball Team Defeats Navy, 4-2;

Twin-Bill at Penn State Postponed

By MARV ZELKOWITZ

Lefty John Carlisle tries to
avenge th e baseball team’s
only setback tomorow, when
he pitches against West Vir-
ginia at Leech Farm. The
Mountaineers won. an earlier
encounter with the ‘Panthers,
knocking Dave Sauer out of the
box in the ﬁrst inning, and coast-
ing to a 7-4 win.

Coach Bobby Lewis wasn't im-
pressed with Steve Harrick’s
baseball players, despite their 28-
1 record. “They got all the breaks
against us,” Lewis said. “When
we had the infield drawn up, they
bounced a ball over the third
baseman’s head.” ‘

The Panthers defeated Navy on
Friday at Annapolis, 4-2, and
were rained out at- University
Park Saturday, in a doubleheader
with Penn State that would have
decided ‘which of the two teams
would go to the NCAA playoffs in
June.

Same As Last Year

A similar situation occurredlast
year, when a scheduled double-
header with the Nittany Lions at
Forbes Field was rained out. Penn
State received the bid to the Dis-*
trict two playoffs last year be-
cause of a better overall record.

A sweep of last year’s twinbili‘.
. probably would, have earned the
Panthers a bid.’ ,,

“I couldn’t blame them for
not wanting to reschedule the
games last year,” Lewis said.

“They were in the driver’s seat. A

State had everything to lose
and nothing to gain by playing.

Dick Wagner

Spark Navy Win

This year the situation is slight-
ly reversed. The Panthers have
the better record, 14-1, as com-

pared to the Lions’ 14-4. Both

squads have lost to West Virginia,
but the Panthers topped Navy,
while the Staters dropped 'a ten
inning 6-5 decision to the Mid-
shipmen. - .
.. Wagner Hits

Left ﬁelder Dick Wagner’ col-

lected two‘ hits in four at bat,’

and drove in two runs to lead the
Panthers to their win at Anna-

polis. The Panthers never trailed
in the contest.

Jim Sylvis went eight innings‘
in collecting his third victory
of the season without a. defeat.
Lee Brueckel relieved Sylvis,

‘and finished the game.

Fred Mazurek hit a home run,
and Al Ricciuti continued hit bat-
ting streak, collecting two hits in

If someone said the only

Thomas_sey had received a head
injury while playing end at Fort
Cherry High and his doctor ad-

"(Because the University found out

what his doctor had advised','they
only offered him ‘a track scholar-
ship, and Thomassey accepted.
The decision has really’ made
one man glad -- track coach Carl

blessed with in his ﬁve years as
track mentor. The ﬁrst was Wes

“I think Al’s biggest problem
was the broken leg he received
last year,” said Rees. “It kept
him out of competition all -last
year and he is a year behind in
his conditioning. Also, Al is
married and his wife had a baby
in the fall so he had to go to work
to support his family and he miss-

“A discus man__ and shot putter
has to lift wegihts in order to.
keep in shape and A1 just hasn’t
had the.time. I’d guess right now
that Al is about a year behind in
his conditioning,” -said Rees.

So-far this season it doesn’t
seem that Thomassey is that far
behind. In the two dual meets‘
and a triangular meet this year
A] has taken a. first in the discus
and a first or second in the shot
put. He also placed ﬁfth in the
Penn Relays in thediscus.

Rees is also planning to send
Thomassey to, the IC4A’s, if he
does well in the negrt meets. _“If Al
can make a good showing in the

nity to keep the public informed
about their cultural activities.

versity Theatre will be such
groups as the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Symphonette, the Harold
Betters Quartet and other organi-
zations from Duquesne University
and Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology.

How TO SEE EUROPE .
FOR-ONLY $300.'A DAY; NO. 3

When all of you go to Europe during your summer vacation,
you will certainly want to visit Spain, where the tall corn grows,

The ﬁrst thing you will notice upon entering Spain is the
absence of sibilants. In Spain “s” is pronounced “th” and
thereby hangs 9. tale. Until the reign of Philip IV—or Guy
Fawkes, as he was sometimes callcd—Spa.nia.rds said ‘'3'’ just
like everybody else. Philip IV, however, lisped, and Spaniards,
having an ingrained sense of propriety and not wishing to em-
barrass their monarch, decided that everybody should lisp. This
did indeed put Philip IV very much at his case, but in the end

it turned out to ‘be a very bad thing for Spain. It wrecked the-

sassafras industry—Spain’s principal source of revenue—a.nd
reduced the nation to a second-class power.

  

As a result, Spaniards were all forced to turn to bull ﬁghting
in order to keep body and soul together. Today, wherever you
go in Spa.in—in Madrid, in Barcelona, in Toledo, in Cleveland
—-you will see bulls being fought. "For many years the bulls
have sought to arbitrate this long-standing dispute, but the
Spaniards, a. proud people who use nothing but Castile soap,
have rejected all overtures. V

It is therefore necessary for me to explain bull ﬁghting to
anyone who is going to Spain. It is also necessary for me to
say a few words about Marlboro Cigarettes because they pay
me for writing this column, and they are inclined to pout if I
ignore their product. In truth, it is no chore for me to sing the
praises of Marlboro Cigarettes, for I am one who fairly swoons
with delight when I come upon a. cigarette which gives you the
full, rich taste of good tobaccos plus the pure white Selectrate
ﬁlter, and Marlboro is the only smoke I have found that fulﬁlls
both requirements. Oh, what a piece of work is Marlboro! The
ﬂavor reaches you without stint or diminution. You, even as I,
will ﬁnd these statements to be happily true when once you

Top box, and are made only by the makers of Marlboro.
But I digress. Let us return to bull ﬁghting. Bulls are by

nature bellicose creatures who will keep ﬁghting till the cows

come home. Then they like to put on pipe and slippers and
listen to the “Farm and Home Hour.” However, the Spaniards
will not allow the bulls any surcease. They keep attacking the
bull and making veronicas—a. corn meal pancake ﬁlled with
ground meat. Bulls, being vegetarians, reject the veronicns
and then, believe you me, the fur starts to ﬂy!

To be perfectly honest, many Spaniards have grown weary
of this incessant struggle and have left their homeland. Co-
lumbus, for example, took off in three little ships——the Patti,
the Maxene, and the Laverne—and discovered Ohio. Magellan
later discovered Columbus. Balboa also sailed to the New
World, but he was silent on a peak in Darien, so it is difficult
to know what he discovered.

Well sir, I guess that's all you ‘need to know about Spain.
So now, as the setting sun casts its rosy ﬁngers ove_r El Greco,
let us take our reluctant leave of Spain—or Perﬁdious Albion,
as it is jocularly called. Aloha, Spain or Perﬁdious Albion, aloha!

9 1963 Max Shulmau
It =l= vl:

Let us not, however, take our leave of smoking pleasure. Let
us keep enjoying those ﬁne Marlboro Cigarettes——i'ich, golden

tobacco—pure white Selectrate Iilter—soft pack or Flip-Top -

box—available in all ﬁfty States of the Union.
