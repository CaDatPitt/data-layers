Edgewood Country Club is reg-
ularly featuring Boden’s boys.
Their appearance here is made
possible by their offer to play at
cost as a “special contribution to
Pitt‘s Community Chest Drive.”
The intermission entertainment
will be highlighted by the, first
announcement of total student
.contri.butions. ‘
This will mark the first Pitt
affair to be held in the Ball Room
of the Masonic Temple in several
years, and is the result of a spe-
cial ruling by the Board of Direct-
ors allowing it to be used at cost.
So that all student contributions
may be used by the Community
Chest, the University agreed to
pay all costs of the dance.

 

“George Washington” ﬁnally
was bedded down last night as
Pitt Players presented the Kauf-
man and Hart comedy to an ap-
preciative audience of ﬁrst-night-
ers. The .premier performance
marked the Players’ thirtieth year
on campus.

The cast, headed by Lucille
Bodner and John Ingrim, kept a
regular current of laughs ﬂoating
stageward as the tribulations of

comic situation after another.

Thanks to the stage directions
of Messrs. Kaufman and Hart, the
cast was able to save the property
crew some trouble as they tore
the third act scenery down in a
final orgy of revenge on the vil-
lainous landlord, Mr. Prescott.‘

Following the show, invited
guests- were received downstairs
at a formal reception prepared by
Mary Eleanor Hershberger.
Among those invited were Pitts-
burgh dramatic critics, members
of local drama groups, and Uni-
versity student and faculty lead-
- ers.

Prompted by an oﬁer by Henry A. \\'allacc to address the

student body on Nov. 11, Student Congress voted Tuesday to ‘

ask Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald for a clarit'ﬁc.ation of Uni-
versity policy relevant to the appearance of controversial per-
sonalities at campus assemblies.

A meeting \Yednesday afternoon between George Lynn,
Congress president and Chancellor Fitzgerald brought no_,indi-
cation of the administrations sentiment toward the Wallace
overtiire. ~

After a lively debate, members of Student Congress were
brought to an inipasseby a statement of Dean Biddle’s that
it was an established lfniversity poliizy not to sponsor political
speakers. Members of Men’s Debating Association, who at-
tended the meeting, pointed out that. the llliiversity had spon-
sored, approximately ten years ago, a talk by Norman Thomas,
prominent American socialist.

Dean Biddle said that he believed the University ,originally
had refused to sponsor a Norman Thomas talk on the grounds
that it would be of a political nature, but later assented be-
cause his views had diminished in political timeliness.

Bob lngrim, chairman of the Assemlily Committee, said he

Mr. "Henry Wallace’ is in the public eye.
From a newspaper point of view he is good
copy. He makes news. From a citizen’s and a
student’s point of view he is good stimulus
material. He makes people think.

What Mr. VVallace says is not so important
as that-he has something to say and that he
be given an opportunity to. say it. Freed from
his cabinet position, by the President’s request,
lV._[r. VVal1ace has taken it upon himself to cham-
pion his beliefs far and wide. In the process he
has gathered a considerable follow'ng and also
considerable opposition. His support has come
from Communist-tainted organizations, left-of-
center groups, and from a goodly number of
sincere, solution-seeking citizens.

Whether Mr. Wallace is right or wrong,
whether he is acting from unselﬁsh motives or

.is the tool ofpersons with ulterior purposes,

or «whether his disciples are all raving radi-
cals or people with an answer should have no
bearing on his right to addres an assembly of
college students. The fact that he has obtained
a following, that some people, some groups do
aprove of hispposition on domestic and world
affairs makes it rather more important that he
be heard. .

‘There is no surer way of giving the lie to
rumors either pro or con concerning Mr. ‘Val-

V . lace than to hear him out, ‘in person, and re-

flect on what he says. We believe college stu- A

decide for themselves the meritsiof the views

Recently, Students for Democratic Action,
an affiliate organization of Americans for Dem-
ocratic Action, enacted a “Student ‘Bill of.
Rights’.” Article 5 of this ‘Bill’ stateszi

“N 0 control should be exercised by col-
lege authorities over the subjects or out-
side speakers chosen by student groups.”

We believe the Wallace speech falls under this
clariﬁcation. is _

The acceptance of Mr. Wallace as a speaker
before a student assembly should in no Way
be construed as approval by the University ’s
administratio not’ the “Wallace program” or
any opinions he might express from the ros-
trum or of the organizations sponsoring him.

To paraphrase, we think the word ‘should
be: Let the students decide.

Another Good Man

John Rozanski played football for Pitt for
three _of his four years here. Now, as a senior, he
has found that an injury makes it impossible
to play thisyear.

The loss to Pitt’s team is a gain to -the
rest of the University activities program. Roz-
anski, last week, was appointed by Student
Congress to represent the student body on the
Faculty ‘Committee on Athletics. From the text
of the speech he gave in Bill Tacey’s speech
class this week, we have no fears as to the
resolute mind and attitudes the boy has.

Although some quarters have openly at-
tacked Congress for their appointments, we
think that the student governing group could

-not have picked better men than George Lynn,

Walt Thompson, and, now, Rozanski. Too often,
the opinions’ of student leaders vacilate be-
tween opposinginfluences on a harmonic 0-
tion basis.

Lynn, Thompson, and Rozanski, three vets,
typify’ clear headed maturity. They are not yes
men. ‘

O-.S.U. Rally. Proves
Pitt Has Spirit

John Rozanski, recent appointee -to a temporary, post on the
Faculty Committee on Athletics and former tackle for the Pitt foot-

ball team, provided the sensation. of the week with his talk on “School
Spirit.” The speech was delivered in Mr. William Tacey’s Speech

101 class. Its tirrieliness and point

have led us to deviate from the

established “school spirit tabop,” and print the speech.

A new Pitt Panther, strong, sharp, groomed for victory’ in
battle, was born on Monday, October 27, 1947 at Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial hall. The University came alive after nine

long (dead) years. ‘It had spi
school spirit. The heart of Pitt

rit, plain ordinary, important
was beating again.

Every so often, I" like to think¢
of school spirit as a sort of nour-
ishment, serving the same pur-
pose as the food we eat. It keeps
us going, makes us stay on the
ball, helps us in our striving for
what we want out of college life.
“Then Mom bakes a cake, she
puts in to the mixture certain
components —- vanilla ﬂavoring,
sugar, eggs, etc. The same goes for
schoolspirit. In its recipe it needs
certain components and those cer-
tain components are: scholarship;
athletics; social and religious af-
fairs; publications; and ‘speech
music, radio, dramatics and ﬁne
arts. These are the ﬁve phases of
campus ‘life.

Take the- component athletics,
for example. College football, in
the majority of cases is the most
outstanding athletic sport in the
institutions, of higher learning all
over the country. Through its
football team, a school makes it-
self known. That you can’t deny.

When Mom baked that cake, she
used a bottle of vanilla ﬂavoring
manufactured by a reputable com-
pany, employing people, properly
paid, properly fed, generally
speaking, properly taken care of.
This is done so that a good job can
be performed by the "workers in

make your mother’s cake a tasty
and delicious thing.

‘ The parallel between what I
have just said and what athletics,
football and the like, contribute
to school spirit, is identical all the
way down the line. In order for
your motherto bake a tasty and
delicious cake, she has to use
vanilla ﬂavoring excellently pro-
duced by workers properly and
decently taken care of. In order
to have real school spirit, you’ve
got to have athletics excellently
produced by ﬁne, strong boys, pro-
perly and decently taken care of.
Thus it goes for the, other four
components of school spirit.. Each
one of the ﬁve'is vitally neces-
sary. When they are united,

cerely worked out and given full
support, the result is pure, real
honest-to-goodness school spirit.
As I previously mentioned the
school spirit of a college or uni-
versity is the godliness of its ma-
terial, intellectual and moral as-
pects. This godliness requires per-
severence—when you have a par-
ticular job to do, work at it un-
til the job is well done; integrity
—have an unimpaired and un-
broken state of mind and body;
Trustworthiness-—be justly deser-
vant-of conﬁdence; and, last, the
little but good things of college
kite  .atten   i’ is
We

walk, or.Bob Davison the janitor,"

mopping the Commons Room
every night for the last 18 years,
or. Scotty, the elevator operator
withhis robust laugh, or pep ral-
lies, or even the Tuck Shops and
the Cathedral cafeteria.

Applying perseverance, integri--
'ty, trustworthiness, and the little
but good things of Pitt life, and
the ﬁve components of school spir-
it, we, Pitt students, will have
real school spirit.

A week ago Monday, at the pep
rally, I knew, I felt it, that some-
thing new was beginning. That
Pitt was putting on a new suit
of working clothes. But this time
we can’t let this school spirit die.
We have to keep it alive and we’ve
got to keep it rolling. How. shall
wt; do this? The answer is: work,
work, damn hard work. A

,- When we leave the University
of Pittsburgh, this new school
spirit of ours can be transferred
into the American spirit, into the
democratic spirit of life, keeping
not only the heart of America

beating, but also of the world.‘

There, you are. School spirit——
American spirit — World spirit.
Here at Pitt and on every cam-
pus of every college and univer-
sity throughout the country, stu-
dents are continuously and faith-
fully building a foundation of real
‘school spirit. Let’s build an endur-
able and permanent foundation.
It’s worth it.

Editors of the Pitt yearbook

In a statement to the News,
Owl Editor Walt Thompson said,
“We think we have a good theme

can readily build an accurate
portrayal of Pitt life and the spir-
it of the University; In order that
the students may better know

plans now while the sales cam-

that Withholding this information

sponsoring Henry Wallace ,would
be taken as a support of his views.
Bob Dickey, who had opposed the
idea. of a Henry Wallace talk from
the start, moved that the Congress
abandon the idea of sponsoring
the address, but the motion was
overruled by a close vote. p

More debate followed, but,
failing to make any progress,
Congress passed Bill Veenis’ mo-
tion: “A Request be made to
Chancellar - Fitzgerald concerning
obtaining services of Henry Wal-
lace, November 11.”

Before the stalemate, Bill Vee-
nis declared that “a University
ought to sponsor speakers on all
sides of important issues, and to
fail to sponsor a Wallace talk af-

. ter so much publicity would leave

Congress open to attack from all
shades of liberals and radicals.”
Bob Dickeycountered that Con-
gress was “notmorally justiﬁed”
in supporting Wallace in this man-
ner, and that the ,University
shouldn’t be a political battle

_ ground.

Bob- Ingrim argued that spon-
soring a Wallace talk did not con-

stitute support of his views. In-

grim said his Assembly Commit-‘
tee had been enthusiastic cover a
chance to present a prominent
national ﬁgure and personality to
the students.

Mrs. Ruth Goldworth, a Pitt
student and member of the Young
Progressive Citizens of America,
said that YPCA would pledge its
large enthusiastic membership to
aid Congress ifgit‘ should decide
to_sponsor a Henry Wallace talk.
Mrs. Goldworth pointed out that

"many YPCA members are Uni-

versity students. The YPCA is a
branch of PCA, the organization

bringing Henry Wallace to Pitts-
 1 burgh.

Alex , Newell, another member

 -or YPCA, added that the Univer-
 sity has an excellent opportunity

to present the chief exponent. of

an important viewpoint to the

student body. A ,

Bob Ingrim said Henry; Wallace
would speak free of charge, ‘but
Congress would have to pay for
the use of Carnegie Music Hall-
He also added, that the student
body of Carnegie Tech would en-

dorse Pitt’s~ sponsorship of a Hen- ’

ry Wallace speech, however, ‘no
monetary assistance has been
promised. -

Drink--Mercury

Tragedy is often amusing and
just as often expensive.

During an experiment ‘in "the
Ellsworth chem lab‘on Wednesdy,
a. thirsty student accidently drank
some mercury. His thirst was so
great he wanted to cure it as
speedily as he could.’

After he had downed thetshot, '

he started to feel for the brass rail
and just as soon as herealized it
wasn’t there, he discovered his
mistake.
Doc Carlson was consulted and
the diagnosis was “no alarm.”
The thirsty student, warned not
to mix his drinks, received notice
from the economically minded
chemistry department.
_He was charged six cents‘ as
payment for the destroyed mer-
cury.

Ohio State
Victory Loot
Still Missing   R

Student Congress Loot Recovery
Committee met Monday for a ﬁn-
al tabulation of the loot return-
ed from -the Ohio State victory

» celebration. It was ‘revealed that

less than one—half of the plunder
has been returned. 1

There are 20 ﬂags, 20 poles, and
numerous signs still missing. These
are material things’ that can be re-
turned. The extensive damage
done to P-.C.W. and Carnegie
Tech can be coinpensated for only

it by ﬁnancial reimbursement.

The committee hopes that the
rest of the loot will be returned
this week. They ask that the stu-
dent body co—operate with them
to settle all the complaints as
soon as possible.

Any person who took an article
during the victory rally is urged
to return it to the student desk
on the ground floor. No question
will be asked.

Anyone desiring transporta-
tion to return the loot should get
in touch with Mr. Ricart, Dean of
Mens Ofﬁce, or Herb Franklin,

’MrsM.‘

Former .Wril-er
And Columnist

After jeeping all through Eur-
ope in the wake of the American
invasion forces during the war,
Mrs. Marjorie Bernhard must ﬁnd
lecturing to her journalism class-
es at Pitt rather dull.

One of the newest members of
the Pitt faculty, - Mrs. Bernhard
was among the dozen-odd women
who covered the European theater
throughout the war as corres-
pondents for the American press. '

A feature writer, columnist and
Sunday news editor for the Detroit
Free Press, she went to London
early in 1943 as correspondent
for a midwestern newspaper chain
which included her own paper
and the Chicago Daily News.
There she visited U. S. Eighth Air
Force bases all over the British
Isles, writing features on the or-
der of the columns lastiwritten by
Ernie Pyle. .

She met the famous Roving Re-
porter many times in England and
in Northern Ireland where they
the American troops stationed
there.

Three weeks after the Norman-
dy landing, Mrs. Bernhard arriv-
ed in France, following the inva-
sion forces clear into Paris,
where she, set up headquarters
with the entire European press
corps in the Hotel Scrieb. The ‘city
had fallen only three days_previ-

both did a series of columns on’

ous to her arrival, and snipers
were still holding out on rooftops
while bands of French guerrillas
combed the streets for Nazis and
collaborators.

It was at the Scrieb that she last
saw Ernie Pyle as he ate breakfast
before leaving for home. “Hewas
at the end of his string, a very
worn out man. Every one of us
felt that he had done all he could,
and should go home for good,” she
remarked.

From Paris, she traveled all over
Europe on the trail of fast-

breaking news events. She was

with the British First IA1?r’ny. at
Brussels when they moved down
to ﬂank the ‘ German break-
through that initiated the Battle
of the Bulge, then met General
Patto~n’s forces at ‘Luxembourg’, as
he moved to meet the British.
Staying at Luxembourg through-

out the‘ mid-winter battle, she_

then followed the Ninth Army's
race‘ to the Rhine, crossing soon
after the initial beach—head which
she witnessed and reported.

In Germany,~ she trailed the
Ninth’s dash ‘across the country.
and entered Cologne while Ger-
man guns still shelled the city.
Here, she and another spon-
dent secured a jeep and set off
for the front, hoping to guess the
point at which the Americans
would meet the Russian advance.

“It was pure luck,” she stated,

._“but when the Russians reached

the. east bank ofthe Elbe River
at Torgau, we »were‘”only twenty-

Correspondent

five miles from the west bank, and
covered the historic meeting.
The celebration that followed was
like an American political’ picnic.
I even danced with a Russian.”-

To file her story, Mrs. Bern- '
hard had to drive sixty m1les*

through a blackout to First Army,
Press camp, sleeping on the 13001‘.
when they stopped. From there
she ﬂew back to Paris, then to

R-heims for the German surren---~
der,’and back_' to Paris for V—E.‘

day.

She covered the liberation of
Oslo and‘,Copenhagen, often drlv-j

ing around with armed German
soldiers who so out-numbered
their British conquerors that sev-
eral weeks passed before they
were able to ‘surrender.’

— -Leaving Europetin August; 1945.
the lady correspondent returned to
the United States, where she mar-
ried. Prior to settling down here
in Pittsburgh, her ,
home, Mrs. ‘Bernhard ireturned to

and Czechoslovakia in the -springs

Dr. Robert Griswold, Univer-
-sity organist, is recuperating in
Monteﬁore hospital from effects of
a serious hand injury receivedin

«Heinz chapel about 9:30 p. m.,

Nov. 3.
Practicing alone at the time of
the accident, Dr. Griswold opened

a heavy trunk to obtain some

sheet music. Apparently he slip-
ped and grasped for the edge of
the chest. ‘

The jar caused the lid to fall
across his left hand resulting in
a severe injury. When he realiz-
ed’ what had happened, Dr. Gris-

‘wold walked out of the chapel

alone, called a cab, and went di-
rectly to the hospital.

Appointed’ organist Sept. 10,
1947, Dr. Griswold succeeded Rus-
sell G. Wichmenn. At the time of
the appointment to the Heinz
chapel position Dr. Griswold
played the organ and directed
musical activities at the Brick

. church, New ‘York.

He‘ received the doctor’s degree
in sacred music from Union The-
ological seminary school of Sacred
Music in New York.

At Texas State College for
Women, Denton, Texas, Dr. Gris-
wold directed a chorus of 80
voices, taught organ, and compo-
sition. He has also taught theory,
solfeggio, composition, and organ
at’ Yankton College, Yankton,

‘teams, then Pitt should win easily.

Pessimistically, the more probable will happen and the

men frorg Lafayette will be able toe
put enough strength on the ﬁeld
to return the Panther to his usual
underdog role. Win, lose, or draw,
the Holcombmen will want. the
Pitt game badly and the clash will
be rough. _
Purdue has been improving
with the season and will be heav-
ily favored over Pitt. However,
there are too many men on the
Pitt squad who remember last
year’s last minute defeat to dis-
pose of this game too-easily. The
Blue and Gold would like revenge.
Stu Holcomb built a team that
is as well balanced as any the
Panthers have faced since the
Michigan game. He has a running
attack that features Harry Szu1-
borski and Norbert Adams who
have averaged 4.7 yards per try.

Defensively, the Boilermakers
haven’t been too free with the

held to three touchdowns and Il-
linois was upset 14-7. The line is

‘big and fast. However this is old

news to Milligan’s kids. They’ve
met bigger and faster lines and
better‘ backs. '

Pitt will meet Purdue in the
middle of a quaint holiday known
as Dad’s Day. Itseems that Big
Nine schools save their celebra-
tion’s until the Pitts arrive.

Indiana welcomed her Dads by
trampling Pitt 41-6. The Minne-
sotas gave their old man a pres-
ent by handing them a 29-0 vic-
tory. After next Saturday, Pitts-
burgh will probably be all out for
artiﬁcial insemination.

At Guard

Fort Sumpter is little and solid
and it won’t budge, though the
enemy does its best. But it is
not in South Carolina — it is right
‘on the Pitt line.

Surprised Pitt fans have dis-
covered that Mike Milligan has a
veritable fort in little Earl Sump-
ter, 175-pound Negro guard, and
nobody is
Sumpter himself. A

“I thought I’d be second or
third string,” he mused, obviously
tickled over his rise to football
prominence.

Sumpter distinguished himself
with outstanding defensive play
against Indiana, Ohio State and
Minnesota. His work in the Ohio
State game earned him a berth on
the Associated Press A1l-Ameri-
can team of the week.

A week later, he fought the
Battle of the Bulge against Min-
nesota’s 246-pound Leo Nemol1ini,_
and made the big boy wish for
an armistice. '
Since the beginning of the sea-
son Sumpter has been the darling
of the Pitt squad. At the Bedford
training camp the head cook
_-learned that it was his birthday,
so she baked him a cake. Earl
ﬂashed a smile the size of a foot-
ball ﬁeld when some 50 players
sang “ﬂappyibirthday to Earl.”
Sumpter’s good fortune, para-
doxically has resulted from the
bad fortune of his teammates.
Johnny Kosh, regular guard, was
sidelined for the season because
of an injured knee.

"lSfafiSticS I Show  
L Weak PiH' Attack

The old axiom that the best defense is a good offense seems
to be holding good for opponents of the Panther eleven.

Illinois, Notre Dame, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio State, and Minne-
sota have gained an average of 360.4 yards per game, while hold-
ing the Panthers to an average of 121.1 yards. Opponents have gar-
nered 212.1 yards rushing and 148.3 through the air per game, while
the Panther aerial attack holds a slight edge on the ground game,

65.1 yards to 56 yards.

Running up against the most powerful gridiron machines in the
country has given the Milligan single—wing offense little opportunity.
Little Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi is the leading ground-gainer with a net
of 109 yards in 40 attempts fore"

an average of 2.6 yards per rush.
Carl DePasqua has the best av-
erage, 4.3 yards, but he has toted
the pigskin only ten times.

Tony DiMatteo is close behind
Cecconi with a 2.4 yards average
in 28 tries. Lindy Lauro_ has an
average of 1.8» yards in 24 rushes,
Jimmy Joe Robinson shows 1.6 in
30 attempts,iand Jack Smodic has
a minus 0.4 average in 20 tries.

Jack Smodic shows the most

‘pass completions, seven, for the

largest total gain, 116 ards. He
has thrown 20 forwards ith none
being intercepted. Carl DePasqua
has the best percentage of suc-
cessfulthrows, ﬁve out of 10, but
two have been intercepted. '

Paul Rickards has connected on
ﬁve out of 13, with two intercep-
tions. A

Jimmy Joe Robinson has com-
pleted ﬁve out of 12 for a gain of
72 yards, with one being picked
off by the opposition. Bimbo Cec-
oni shows the best" average gain
per completion, 35.5 yards, in two
successes out of 12 thrown.

Leading the pass receivers with
124 yards and/fourreceptions is
Bill’ McPeak. _ Lou Cecconi has
snared the most, eight, for 85
yards. Robinson has caught six
for 62 yards.

The Panthers have recovered 10
of their 17 fumbles while cover-
ing l5 of the 34 bobbles commit-
ted against them.

Set to Steal
Radnor’s Post

Sophomore Len Radnor will
really have to hustle next season
to keep a ﬁrst string center job.
Why? The names of Steingraber
and Radosevich are the big rea-
son.

And, truly, they are “big rea-
sons.” Strangely enough the’ two
freshman centers’ ﬁrst names are
George. Then. to complete the
oddity George Steingraber hails
from St. George’s high school.

At the Pittsburgh high school
Steingraber played brilliant ball,
landing a post on the a1l-Cath-
olic Class B state football team
of 1943. _

Steingraber is a tall, rangy cen-
ter weighing 195 pounds and
reaching six feet two inches. His
sparkling play in scrimmages and
his willingness to learn are his
greatest assets commented Fresh-
man Line Coach Dr. Charles Hart-
wig.

On the other hand, George
(party of the second part) Rado-
vich is no small lad either. The
Brentwood center stands six feet,
four inches and weighs 187.

By next fall the young player
should gain 10 or 15 pounds and
will be a tough nut to crack.

Sporting a name common to
Fordham fans, Radosevich is a
sureﬁre bet to ﬁght it out for the
center spot next year. On the
playing ﬁeld, George backs up the
line like a veteran performer, di-
agnosing each ‘play with shrewd
ability.

Sigima Chi Keeps Lead;  

Fiiis

Rip Lambda, 201-O

Sigma Chi clamped hold of ﬁrst place in the National League
by narrowly defeating Phi Kappa, 15-13, last Tuesday at muddy
Shadyside ﬁeld. The victory boosted Sigma Chi, with a record of
5-1, one win ahead of Delta Tau Delta. ,

A safety in the second quarter provided Sigma Chi with the
winning margin. Intercepting a Sigma Chi pass in the end zone, Bill

Boyd was nabbed by Harry Blair

for the two winning points. The

safety was unsuccessful protest-9
ed by the Kappas.

In the ﬁrst quarter Bill Boyd,

Bouncing back, Sigma Chi scor-
ed when Hutch McRandall looped
a 25-yard pass to George Baran-
kovich who raced the remaining
30 yards for the TD.

Minutes before the half, Sigma
Chi registered the winning two
points.

In the second half both teams
scored once. A 45-yard aerial
from McRandall to Barankovich
padded the Sigma'Chi lead until
the. fourth quarter when Boyd in-
tercepted for the Kappas and
sloshed 45 yards for the score.

You can never tell what may
happen to the cast of a Cap and

A member of the publicity staff
of this year's production, ten-
tatively called “On Your Toes,”
was looking over some program
of past shows recently, and un-

earthed some new information
about two of the famous ones. One
is a familiar ﬁgure around the
campus and the other is well
known to those who saw him
dance in “Anchors Aweigh” and
other motion pictures.

The first is “Ted” Biddle, Col.
’29. In his undergraduate days he
always tried out for the cast. He
wasn’ti a very good looking girl

and was shunted to the business"

staff every time. Later he became
an assistant dean of men, and as
such was graduate manager of
all the Cap & Gown productions
from 1935 to 1941. «
It is said that he wishes he were
still an assistant dean and could
actively participate in this year’s
presentation, “On Your Toes.”
Gene Kelly, Col. ’33, is the other
kell known ‘alumnus of Cap &
Gown. He succeeded where “Ted”
Biddle failed, and danced in the
shows of 1930-1933. Later he was
dance director of the ’35 presenta-
