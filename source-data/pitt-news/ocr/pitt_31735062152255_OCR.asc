College Holds
. First Dance
Annual Ant;-m: Informal
Opens Social Season

 

It falls to the College Association
to open the University social sea‘-
aon next’ Friday night, when that
organization gives its annual au-
tumn informal dance. The ball-
room of' the Hotel Schenley will
again be the ﬂoor for- the associa-
'on’s openingw. event, music for
?hich is to come from’ the horns
nd saxophones of Moore-Strumps
Syncopators.
, Opening its seventh year with a
new organization, a large member-
ship and an attractive program, the
association is preparing to care for
one of the largest attendances of
the fall social season. John St.
Peter, Col. '31, is president of the

Arts Library Grows
100% in One Year

“The ﬁne arts library has a won-
derful collection of books for the
few years it has been in existence,”
is the opinion of Miss Gretta Smith.
new assistant librarian in the ﬁne
arts department. Miss Smith was
formerly head of the art department
of the Indianapolis public library.

During the summer the library
capacity was increased one hundred
per cent through the conversion of
the treasurer’s office, 104 State
Hall, into a stack room. its capac-
ity is at present about 9,500 volumes
and will be increased during the
winter.

The fine arts department was or-
ganized in September, 1927, and at
that time occupied only room 110
State Hall. At present it covers the
cntire first floor with the exception
of Chancellor Bowman's. Dr. Lin-
harfs oﬂ"ice. and the former Dean
Govr’s office.

 

 

 tivity will provide a booth at which ‘
;t.g, . literature and information pertain-

year more than-

31 will be in the hands of Coach
William Brinker, and of the athletic
council, according to a resolution
wssed by student council at ‘its

ednesday afternoon meeting.
Heretofore a committee selected by
student council chose the yell lead-
ers at an assembly in Memorial _Hall
but this year it voted the privilege
ove: to a, body considered more com-
petent.
Twenty candidates who are prac-
ticing daily with Brinker will be
narrowed down and the ﬁnal six
will be recommended by him to the
Athletic Council for deﬁnite selec-
tion. Student council believes that
by this method any possibility _of
favoritism or fraternity politics
will undoubtedly be eliminated.
Practice cheerleading will‘ take
place at the Waynesburg game to-
morrow in the stadium.

Curtis Quits “
Local Post

of Michigan Staff

Dr. Heber D. Curtis, director of
Allegheny Observatory of the Uni-
versity, resigned his position this
week to take charge of the con-
struction of a new, observatory at
the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, Michigan. Announcement of
Dr. _Curtis' resignation was made
last~-night by Dr. John G. Bowman,

Frank Craig Jordan, assistant direc-
tor of the observatory, has been ap-
pointed director. Dr. Kelvin Burns,
astronomer, has been appointed as-
sistant director. ,
Dr. Jordan has been with the Al-
legheny Observatory since 1908._ He
is starred in American Men of Sci-
ence, which means that he has been
selected by fellow astronomers as
worthy of inclusion in the number
of 'the 1,000 leading men of Ameri-
can Science. He is a graduate of
Marietta College and received his
doctor's degree from the University
of ‘Chicago. , .

‘ 3 ‘Decision Dllicult
. Dr.~Curtis, in ‘his resignation,‘ C

in part: .-

“I- just had to -make-an.-exceed-
lngly difficultdecision. I came here
from Lick Observatory with the full
intention of fremaining here till I
should retire. I have had a very
happy ten years here. I do not be-
lieve that any man in academic life
in America has had greater inde-
pendence or thought and actionthan
you ‘good scouts’ have given me.
There has been nothing that I
needed- that you -have not tried to
give me, and you have always’ stood
behind me with counsel and advice,
and, what is more vital, sincere
friendship. All this makes this let-
ter a hard one for me to write.
“The University of Michigan, my
Alma Mater, has urchased a large
tract. of land eig teen miles from
Ann Arbor and will construct a new
observatory there at a cost of ap-
plroximately half a million. The

nivei-sity, and the friends and sup-

porters of the dbservatory, hope
eventually to make this observatory
second only to Mt. Wilson in equip-
ment and budget.
“It is not easy to leave a posi-
tion where one is entirely happy and
contented, no matter how large and
alluring a project is presented as an
alternative. I have, however, de-
cided to undertake this work."

Jsck Mc.Parland, Col. '38, will be

be held October 24. McFarland was
selected by Student Council, meet-
ing in special session for this pur-
pose, Wednesday aftnnoon.

‘ Committees for the dance will be
appointed by McFarland during’ the
next few days and preparations for
the annual Hop are expected to get
under way immediately.

Something of‘a precedent Was es-
tablished by Council in naming the
chairman of the .Sophomore dance,
inasmuch as it removed his appoint»
ment from the. hands of the class
cabinet indeﬁnitely discarded this
Fall. The dance is only four weeks

\

Class ‘offices ' are‘ vacant ‘ because
under the‘ provisions of the Men's
Self ' Governing Association, which
was expected to reach a vote last
s ring, class positions are to be,
eliminated and they were not placed
on the ballot at the general elec-
tions.‘ However, «the suggested
changes in the governing associa-
tions,never came to a vote. which
accounts for the lack of class offi-

cials.
Class Suggests Men

Because it was the only consti-
tuted governing body with the right
to meet the exigency, Council un-
dertook .the selection of the chair-
man from a list of prominent sopho-
moremen suggested by members of
that class. McPai-land was selec
by means of elimination ballots.

Immediately following the selec-
tion of McParland, Emanuel Fish-
kin, Bus. Ad. '31, suggested that
Council continue the same procedure
in naming chairmen of the Junior
and Senior class dances. Discus-
.sion on this point was desultory and
the meeting ad 'ourned without Fish-
kin pressing fs suggestion to a
motion. - ‘ ‘

Dr. Sutherland Reviews
Golden Gridders Of 1930

EDITOR'S NOTE: As the Golden Gridders open their season
tomorrow with Wag/nesburg, Dr. John Bain “Jock” Suther-
land, head coach, takes this opportunity to give to the entire
student body his views upon the Panthers and their schedule.

By JOCK SUTHERLAND

It would take aitunusual squad to match the merits of the men
who played for me last year. and our losses were heavy at grad-
uation time. Prospects, however, are not the darkest they have
been, and certainly they are not the brightest.

There are some good men left among the letter wearers and
naturally I am depending on these men for the most part.

One can never be quite certain about sophomore talent. Some
times the boys who shine brightest as high and prep school play-
ers, and even up in their freshman years, do not become varsity
stars. On the other hand we frequently ﬁnd boys suddenly develop-
ing as good men in their sophomore year, ones who were not
noticeably of the star rank before.

So we cannot tell until we are well in the season just what
strength we will have this year. It may be a better team than we
are looking for. We are always hopeful for we -like to win and we
know our followers want to sit in on winning teams.

The schedule is attractive from the viewpoint of the spec-
tator but considerable of a burden to the coaching _
players for there is a long string of hard games with not a single
letup once we have plunged into the big games.

The last six games are with hard opponents. The two “breath-
ers" are near the top with West Virginia in between.

I can make no promise in the matter of winning games but
you may depend on this, that Pitt will have a hard-ﬁghting team
that will play through this difficult schedule to its utmost

University men interested in de-
bate will have their first chance to

become acquainted with the activi-
ties of the Men’s Debating Associa-
tion at a smoker and debate rally,
to be held tonight in the Activities
Building.

At this time new candidates will
be welcomed by the members of last
year’s teams and tentative plans for
the coming season will be discussed
for the beneﬁt of the newcomers.
Refreshments will be served for all
attending. T

Tryouts, however, do not begin
until October 15, according to Pro-
fessor W. M. Parrish, head of the
public speaking department. ‘

Parrish Comments

“We carry on the most extensive
debating program in the United
States,” says Professor Parrish,
“and the University of Pittsburgh
leads the colleges of the world, as
well, in this activity. Our program
requires a great many new candi-
dates each year. For this reason,
freshman candidates are ‘most eli-
gible. And as we do not wish to
carry over an dead timber from
year to year, al candidates, whether
old or new, are required to try out
for the squad each season. In this
way old and new members alike
have the same opportunities."

Two questions have been selected
for debate for the season 1930-1,931.
They are: Resolved: That the
Eighteenth Amendment Should Be
Repealed and the Control of the
Liquor Traffic Left to the Several
States, and Resolved: That the Ten-
dency to Consolidate Retail Business
in Chain Stores Is to be Deplored.

A complete schedule of the men's
intercollegiate debates for this year
is being prepared by the men’s de-
bate manager, Edward T. Crowder
Jr., Col. ’31, and will be announced
in the near future. At the same
time there will probably be avail-
able a schedule of early bookings of
extension debates to be given before
clubs, societies and high schools in
and about Pittsburgh.

Officers for the year. have been
announced as follows: president,
Samuel Strauss, Col. ’32; manager,
Edward T. Crowder J r., Col. ’31, and

The bureau was equally as active
in its efforts to obtain suitable hous-

students and faculty. A new list of
approved rooming houses was drawn
up and printed. All freshmen and
sophomores not living at home or at

of these approved houses.

The bureau has also printed s, list
of rooming facilities for upperclass-

Cynical Scribe Fooled

We gasp, close our eyes and shiv-
er. What if we had really done it.
We had thoughtvit was just anoth-
erschool year yawning at us. Just
another opening issue of the Weekly
and just another batc of fresh-
men to. be written up. 0 hy bother

‘Why not just sitat home and
write the same, old hooey about
eager faces ' clutching shining vol-
umes, or mer ’ voices gay with the
quest of knows e, or the vordure
of the freshmen. t’s the same thing
every year, anyhow.

But we didn t stay at home. Our
reporter soul wins again; we climb
the steps; and, lo and behold, what
do we have before .- us. Oh, yes,
there’s the eager face alright-—see
it over there—-—and the merry voice.
But are these freshmen? Are these
smartly dressed young coeds, these
pipe-smoking young men, the class
of“ ’34?
ness has never been seen on the

Despite early season reports of the downtown newspaper writers

who visited tho

had high hopes for a successful "team this season, the Wolf-pack will
hardly be more than a set up fo1“*Jbck Sutheriand’s aggregation.

with the Waynes-

weak in the line, the mostimpor,-y

to play creditably in the line in the’
season's opener. - .1

‘greatest of the racquetmen.

Shields is rated as the best bas-
ketball forward in the entire New
England’ Section. He
Rocksbury Prep Schoo for the four
years_.,of his education-there. He is
iregistered as afreshman in the col-
ege.

Eddie Jacobs, number one man on
the Panther sgllﬁd-, has been his op-
ponent, _frien and colleague for
many years. At present, he and
Shie ds ;have been keeping «them-
selves in she e on the P. A. A.

, Pitt and Notre Dame have played
three football games with each
other with‘ the Panthers being held
scoreless in all three games. The
Ramblers defeated the Panthers in
1909 by the score* of 6-0; they
played a scoreless tie with the Pan-
thers in 1911, and they again do-
feated the Panthers in 1912 by the
score of 8-0. ' .

 

Pitt and Waynesburg; have met
three times before -on the gridiron
and Pitt has white-washedthe Yel-I
low Jackets each time- And inci- '
dentally, the Panthers were unde-
featedveach year durng‘ which they
played Waynesburg.

 

Since a football team was ﬁrst or- 0

ganizeil at Pitt in 1890, Pitt has
enjoyed nine undefeated seasons and
in only two of these were they held
to a tie score. Mossecoached one

of these teams.~in 1904, Colonel Joe 3

Thompson coached the 1910 unde-
feated aggregation; Pop Warner
was the mentor of undefeated teams

in 1915, .1916, 1917, 1918, and 1920, _,},
and Sutherland coached undefeated "

teams here in 1927 and in 1929.

 

. The 1910. Pitt team was unscoted 
upon in addition to being unde- '

feated. The team that year num-
bered among its victims Ohio Uni-
versity, Westminster, Waynesburg,
Georgetown, Ohio, West
Washington and Jefferson, Carnegie
Tech, and Penn State. The closest.
ame that season was that with

enn State whom the Panthers de-. 
feated by a score of 11-0 and the P

easiest game was with Ohio Uni- .

Last year, the lineup consisted of Parkinson, Uansa, Ed-

cluded Eddie Baker, Josh Williams, Whitey Williams, Frank-

From what has been written above, a reader of this col-
umn would probably come to the conclusion that your favorite
sport writer thinks the Pantherspare to take a couple on the

nose this season. But several factors lead me to believe other-

prised if Pitt enjoyed another
boo to the contrary.

with Penn State. . V _
‘The’ cheering at the Waynesburg game, however, did not
ensue from the lips of the upperclassmen. Freshmen, not know-
ing the traditional bashfulness of the Pitt cheering section,
cheered loud and long for their favorites, but by the time the
Mountaineers came to town as the next home attraction for the
Panthers, these freshmen had learned their
silent for the greater part of that battle. . _ _ .
The Ohio State battle saw the most enthusiastic cheering
of the season on the part of the Pitt students, thanks to the ef-
forts of Don Saunders, then publicity director of athletics, who
by his constant ballyhoo, managed to arouse the students to
cheer for three quarters of the game, or until the papers on
which they were sitting on that rainy day were sufficiently
soaked to make them good weapons with which they might pep-
per some of the fans who had come to fee a football game.

STUDENTS FINISH STRONG

The students, however, managed to ﬁnish their season in
a blaze of glory when Penn State garnered a one-point lead over
the Panthers in the season's ﬁnale and Jock Sutherland’s boys
had to ﬁght hard throughout the second half in order to ﬁnish
on the long end of the score.

The cheering during the second half of that game was
realistic, pleading and almost frantic at’ times as the Panthers
marched down the ﬁeld or held the Lions for downs or forced
them to punt. But if it was so at this game, why can't the
same be true at all other Pitt contests?

The Panthers have a hard schedule this year, possibly the
hardest that any Pitt team haswfaced in the past ten years,
and I am sure that a little vocal support from the Pitt students
would greatly aid the players at all their games. *

This means that this year Coach Jock Sutherland will

work and several good backs from another frosh team, which

PITT CHEERING

And while on the subject of great football teams, your
scout has noticed that ever since his younger days, when he
would see the Panthers play from his “two-bit” seat, a Pitt
football team has never received "the vocal support of which
it is deserving from its followers. ,

Only three times last season did" any type of vocal utter-
ances that faintly resembled cheering come out of the Pitt stu-
dent section, but these outbursts of youthful enthusiasm were
hardly of sufficient duration for the Pitt students to receive
a pat on the back. ‘

Lightning Rod
Contract Set

Best Type of Conductors
Assured for Cathedral

Installation of the latest type
lightning rods and conductors on t e
Cathedral of Learning is assured by
a recent .oontract.. Twenty-eight
points will be placed on the bell
ﬂoor roof andtop pinnacles of the
structure, and metal strips will be
installed entirely around the para-
pets of the thirty-ﬁrst, thirty-
eighth and thirty-ninth floors. These
strips will act in much the same
manner as the rods, affording com-
plete protection for the upper parts
of the building. '

Much of the work being done on
the stonework just now consists of
“pointing" the masonry already
built. When the stone was ong1-
nally set, the mortar between the
blocks was purposely left out to a
depth of about one-half an inch
from the surface of the stone. This
was done to prevent cracking of the
edges of the stone when the mason-
settled. Pointing the stone con-
sists of ﬁlling the crack left be-
tween thorn with mortar so as to
form a solid smooth wall. At the
same time, the masonry is cleaned
of all loose cement and washed.

Setting of stone is _proceeding
steadily, as usual, with its ultimate
goal at present the top of the build-
ing which will be reached before
severe cold weather arrives. Eight
immense stone gargoyles, two for
each corner of the Cathedral, are
due to arrive today. They will
weigh 5,000 pounds apiece, and are
purely ornamental in character.
These queer stone carvings, as
originally used on Medieval_ Cathe-
drals, served as waterspouts, . but
are not needed in this capacity on
the Cathedral as all rain water will
drain down interior pipes. —

Greeks Make
High Average

Fraternities Reach New
Academic Level At Pitt

 

, ,0
With the announcement of the
scholastic standing of, men's social
fraternities for the school year of
1929-30, it was also revealed that
last year saw the fraternities reach
a new high level of academic attain-
ment with an all fraternity average
of 1.236. '

Chapters with a quality point
average above 1.25 totalled 11, an -
increase of ten in the past -four
years. Chapters with 1.0 and 1.25
quality point averages reached a to- .
tal of 10 --

Other ﬁgures showed that ‘none of, -
the houses had dropped below an
average of .75 as contrasted with a
total of six below this ﬁgure four
years ago. The lowest quality point ‘
average for last year was .931, the
highest point at which the stand-
ings have begun since they were
first computed ﬁve years ago.

Theodore Biddle, assistant to the
dean of men, was particularly en-
thusiastic at the upward trend of
the fraternities and pointed out that
in all phases of computation, the
houses had displayed’ a marked ad-
vance, which he attributed to the
more strictrequirements for pledg-
ing and a competitive spirit for
scholastic attainment which had
been engendered among fraternity
men. 4 —

For the third time -in ﬁve years,
Omega Delta led all other fraterni- ’
ties,~but was followed closely. by Pi ' -
Lambda -Phi and Theta Chi.
