Pt Could lose millions in alleged fraud

by Liz Navratil
1Vewd Editor‘

A company accused of deﬁauding
Pitt and Carnegie Mellon has about
$600 million less than it owes investors,
according to 'a report filed in federal
court.

Robb Evans & Associates LLC,
a company appointed by the federal
court to oversee and evaluate the assets
of Westridge Capital Management and
its afﬁliates, said the corporation has
about $900 million in assets, but that
its investors’ claims appear to be worth
about $1.5 billion.

Pitt officials said the University
invested $65 million in Westridge. The
University sued the company’s prin~
.cipals, Paul Greenwood and Stephen
Walsh, in February for misappropriat-
ing funds . v

At the upscale club located in
the Pittsburgh Strip District, it’s
not unusual to spend a Saturday
night with people painted as ti-
gers and shut in a cage, neon body
paint and glow sticks covering the
dance ﬂoor, bras hanging from an
ornate light ﬁxture or drag queens
decked in fabulously outlandish
attire. ° -

And an endless supply of lol-

lipops.

At Privilege Ultralounge, week C

after week, attendees know that
the themed Blowpop parties do
not suck. What they may not

know is that as they dance. the
night away, they play an important
role in Pittsburgh’s newest wave
of social activism.

Call it progress through a dance
party. '

Ry—n Skyy and ‘Phillip Roy-
ale, the creators of the Saturday
night Blowpop party at Privilege
Ultralounge, will usher in Pitts—
burgh’s Pride Week on Saturday
with the city’s first ever “White
Party” —— where people gay and
straight alike can celebrate their
own brand of pride.” which typi-
cally calls for strictly white attire
and is a staple at Pride festivals
around the country.

After 50 years of service, Pitt’s ‘Sheriff’ retires

by I_.ori Stover
Staff Writer‘

His co-workers call him “the
sheriff” because of his dedica-
tion to the job and distaste for
complaining.

“He’s on top of the game, the

head honcho,” his co-worker Dan’

Guthrie said.

But after 50 years of working
as a custodian at Pitt, “Sheriff”
Johnny Bowden has decided to
retire.

At the age of 83, Bowden said
he still has plenty of energy, but
he thought he might as well give
retirement a try.

“Right now, I feel like I could
keep on working, but I have to go
sooner or later,” he said. “I might
get out there and find out what
l’ve been missing. I might find out
laying around is all right.”

Before retirement, Bowden
didn’t lay around much at all, his
co—workers said.

Co—worker Joseph Mubanga
said Bowden would never com-
plain about being sick when ill and
would keep working instead. By
doing this, Bowden inspired the
younger workers to focus on get-
ting the job done, Mubanga said.

Guthrie said despite his strong
work ethic, Bowden would never
bother or criticize anyone.

“He was as easy—going as any-
body could be,” Guthrie said.
“Even on a bad day, he’d make
you laugh.”

and keep busy, no matter the '

job. .
His daughter, Leslie Kisner,
said Bowden keeps himself ac-

 

years working for Pitt during a surprise p'arty in his honor.

Frank Connors, who has

worked with Bowden for 12 years, I

said that other than some light-

hearted joking, Bowden always

“did what he had to do.”
Bowden said he likes to work

tive even outside of work.

When he has free time, Bowden ‘

likes to take long walks, visit his
friends and visit different places
around Pittsburgh. He goes to

PPG Place in the winter to watch

families ice skate, Kisner-said, and
he likes to go shopping in the "Strip
District.

“He’s coming to a new fron-

 

  

tier, a new focus,” she said.i“I’m
encouraging him to keep on the
move.”

Only Bowden’s avoidance of
technology seems to -reveal his
age.

Council could raise colleges’ clout

by Lori Stover
Staﬂ Writer

Student government leaders at

A Pitt and other local universities said

they hope they can have more say in
local politics by bonding together.
Pitt Student Government Board
member Nila Devanath said stu-
dents and student government
members from Pitt, Carnegie
Mellon, Point Park, Duquesne
and Carlow universities are work-
ing together to form the Pittsburgh
Intercollegiate Council. The council
will aim inﬂuence local politics and
to promote diversity on each of the
campuses. -

, Devanath said the idea start-
ed with CMU student Stephano
Dubuc, who noticed what he called
an underrepresentation of minority
students on all of the campuses.

From there, Dubuc, who did not
respond to ‘requests for interviews,
contacted Pitt’s Student Govern-

ment Board and others‘ to try to
get each school to work together"
toward a solution, she said.

As of now, the council has met
once with representatives from
each of the ﬁve schools and will

soon develop a constitution.

“Right now, we’re in the begin-
ning stages,” Devanath said.

, The process of writing the con-
stitution could take a few months,
she said, and gathering together the
schools and electing representa-
tives to attend the council meetings
would take even longer..

Devanath guessed that the coun-
cil could —— but probably would not
— be ready for another year.

The majority of Pitt’s SGB fa-
vors joining the council, she said. In
particular, she and board members
Alexa Jennings and Andrew Free-
man have worked on bringing the
council together.

With the current economy, stu-
dent government members from
Pitt and other schools have been

' reluctant to use resources on a

new group without knowing ex-
actly how the group will operate,
Devanath said.

The council currently faces the

challenge of bringing together stu-

dent governments from universities
with widely differing structures, she
said. For instance, Pitt’s student gov-

ernment consists of a nine—member I

board, while Carnegie Mellon uses
a senate structure.

Even while discussing the struc-
ture for the council itself, the coun-
cil received many different, often
contentious suggestions, Devanath
said. ,

Before it is ready, the council
also needs the approval of the
presidents and chancellors of each
of the participating schools, she
said.

Dean of Students Kathy Hum-
phrey said she’d heard of the group,
but declined to comment further on
it until she knew more about how
it will operate.

A few of the schools have sent
members of their general student
body but haven’t yet sent student
government members, Devanath
said. To increase the credibility of
the council, she said, they hope to

include the student government of _

each school.

If the council succeeds in bring-
ing the schools together, they will
lobby city council on issues such
as the $12 rental fee for living in
a dormitory and the ban on porch
couches, she said.

Typically, Pitt gathers about
5,000 voters for a national elec-
tion. Considering that in the last
local election, Ravenstahl won the
Democratic mayoral primary by
26,000, combined student voting
could hold signiﬁcant sway over
the political dealings of the city,
she said.

i Also, she said the council wants
to work on the recruitment and re-
tention of minorities on campuses
throughout Pittsburgh.

Devanath added that she looks
at the council as a_long-term goal.
It might not entirely come together
while she holds office, but she said
she would like to get it started for

‘ future Pitt students.

Eventually, the council hopes
to resurrect a disbanded council
of student governments across
the state.

About 10 years-ago, she said,
such acouncil inﬂuenced statewide

politics, but it fell apart when it lost

funding.

With a council this large, De-
vanath said students could have
more say in issues like tuition in-

creases and funding drops.

many bill will insure

by Joe Kennedy
and Lindsay Carroll
Staﬂ Report

A new state bill could allow 400,000 more
Pennsylvanians to use their parents’ health
insurance, but state ofﬁcials disagree on the
bill’s terms. ‘

Senate Bill 189, sponsored by Sen. Jake
Corman (R—Centre), allows young adults
to remain on their parents’? group health
insurance plans until they turn 30. The bill
will become law with Gov. Ed Rendell’s
signature.

Melissa Fox, spokeswoman for the Penn-
sylvania Insurance Departinent, said that
the employer ultimately decides whether

The UPMC legal department is research-

ing the issue to ﬁnd out which beneﬁts are

mandated and which are discretionary if the
bill is signed into law, said Nancy Gilkes,
beneﬁts relationship manager at Pitt’s Hu-
man Resources department.

She said her departmentis working with
UPMC to ﬁgure out how this law could af-
fect Pitt’s health coverage programs.

The current law allows for children to be
covered under their parents’ health plans un-
til they turn 19, unless they areiin college.

The new law offers the extension to those
under 30 if they are not married, have no
dependents, and are Pennsylvania residents
or full-time college students at a Pennsylva-

nia institution.

“Employers are not required to have the

the employer, i.e. the policy holder, chooses
to include it in the package.”

Alan Meisel, director of Pi-tt’s Center -for

choose to keep their children on their plans.
Fox said parents could see their costs increase
by hundreds of dollars per month.

“The extended coverage is not free,” she
said.

She also said that the law will apply to
new contracts and renewals 180 days after
the bill is signed.

“So, if the bill is signed before the end
of June, [and] a policy is issued or renewed
in January 2010, the provision will kick in
with thatjanuary 2010 issuance or renewal,”
Fox said. .

The bill shouldn’t affect Pitt’s Student
Health program because it uses a portion
of the student activities fee to pay for ser-
vices, said Student Health medical director
Elizabeth \X/ettick. Student Health does not
participate in third-party billing, she said in
an e-mail. ,

“We hope that this will mean that more
students, both graduate and undergraduate,
will be covered by health insurance to en-
sure there are no barriers for any student to
receive medical care,” Wetuck said. if

Corman said he supported the bill be-
cause the largest population of uninsured
Pennsylvanians is young people between the

ages of 18 and 35.

“This was a way to extend [coverage] even
longer, so that all the young people who are
transitioning into the work force and are
unable to get health insurance in their own
right can still buy it through their parent’s

“Charging a premium for college grads to

Electives mustcompensate 

for loss of journalism trackl

When Pitt announced injanuary
 that it might collapse the journalism
 writing track into the creative non-
 ﬁction track, we were immediately
 taken aback.

While the future of the study

 of i journalism at Pitt remained
 murky for a few months, David
 Bartholomae, chair of the English
 department, recently announced
 that the creative nonﬁction and
 journalism tracks would be merged

M  into a single nonﬁction track.

In an e—mail sent to Pitt’s journal-
 ism faculty, Bartholomae explained
 the reasoning behind this decision.
 As Pitt doesn’t have a journalism
school or a department dedicated
 to journalism, Pitt’s English depart-
 ment was wary that the journalism
course listings couldn’t compare to
those offered by universities with

I  journalism schools.

 , Even with our past and current
i qualms regarding the disintegra-
tion of journalism at Pitt, we feel
this decision reflects the English
department’s belief that it’s acting
in the best interest for students —
including those studying journal-
ism. ‘

But to keep the pursuit of jour-
., nalism at Pitt viable, Bartholomae
 and the department must not water

Despite the nixing of the track,
relevant journalism electives must

‘A still be available to students.

Bartholomae said in his e—mail
he hopes the department will offer
an expanded selection of journal-
ism electives such as a course in
 online journalism and a course in
 ethics. But we feel the department

—  should have had a deﬁnite collec-

 tion of journalism electives before
E it finalized its decision to merge

down the journalism curriculum,

 

tracks. Under the revamped cur— 
ricula, the Newspaper 1 and News— 
paper 2 courses will probably not 

be offered, Bartholomae said.
Without the core newspaper

courses; the choice of electives 
. becomes increasingly imperative. 

An online journalism course and a 
course on journalistic ethics sound 

innovative and pertinent to modern
journalism, but these electives must
also fill a gap left by the absence of
the core newspaper courses. ,

While the two core nonﬁction
classes -:—— Nonfiction 1  Non-

fiction 2 — intend to incorporate 2
journalistic writing skills, we hope 
students will be aptly prepared for i

more rigorous journalism courses
such as Advanced Reporting. News—

and the department should make
sure students can obtain the skills
offered in these classes through the
electives in light of their absence.
Of course, even with suitable
course offerings, we’re saddened to
see the termination of journalism
as an official track. It:’s understand-
able that, as a division of the Eng-

lish writing major, the journalism !

' paper 1 and 2 were designed as pre- 
requisites for Advanced Reporting, :

track program wasn’t as extensive 

as schools with exclusive journalism
schools and _prograrns. .
Yet, journalism is a ﬁeld of writ-
ing that continues to attract stu-
dents, and journalistic writing skills
are pertinent to ﬁelds outside of

journalism. While the merging of ;

the tracks inevitably changes that
nature of journalism instruction
at Pitt, at least journalism courses

won’t disappear from Pitt’s curricu— 2

lum. Only the future  tell how
this change will affect journalism
students at Pitt.

Alan (Zach Galiﬁanakis), Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) nurse a wicked "Hangover" and

there friend went, What happened the night before and if they should be in possession of an infant.

by Noah Levinson
Staﬂ "Writer

Travelingto Las Vegas for a single
night of alcohol consumption and
stripper confrontation just doesn’t cut
it anymore _

After “The Hangover” — in the-
aters this Friday -4 loose  sto-

' len cop cars and Mike Tyson will all

become integral components of the
perfect-bachelor party.

In the comedy, Bradley Cooper,
Ed Helms and Zach  play
Phil, Stu and Alan, respectively They
wake up in the city of sin without
their friend Doug,’ played by Justin

I Bartha (“National Treasure”’sen'es),

and must locate him before his wed-
ding. Theproblem: None of them
can remember what happened the
previous night. ,

To make the ﬁlm even more arnus-
ing the scriptwas explicitly written so
that the audience will be as confused
as the ﬁlm’s characters.

“You’re in the exact same head-
space as the guys are in,”  Coo-
per (“Yes Man,” “He’s Just Not That
Into You”), said.

But to director Todd Phillips (“Old
School”),  makes perfect
sense, despite their explanations not
being, well, in the movie

. “The chicken they took to feed the
tiger. They stole a cop car because they

_ needed the  in between them

to put the  in,” Phillips said, in
reference to various relics from the
previous night. “I like that people see
it as randomness, but I also like that
there are reasons behind it.”

Phillips was handed an early draft
for “The Hangover,” but decided it
wasn’t sinful enough.

“Why would you ever write
a movie about a bachelor party in

Vegas and make it PG-13?” Phillips A

asked.

After revising the script with an
R  in mind, Phillips set out to
make his movie with a relatively un-
known cast; ,

“Something like this feels realer for
me,” he said. “The  is perfect
because it’s so surprising, in a way.”

Both Galiﬁanakis and Helms
(“The Ofﬁce”) are stepping up from
the world of television to embrace

‘ roles in ﬁlm.

Galiﬁanakis plays one of the weird-
er characters in the movie — Doug’s
future brother—in-law with an odd af-
ﬁnity for thejonas Brothers — but he
doesn’t mind it one bit.

“I’ve been accused of beingweird
myself, and I don’t really agree with
that, but weird is fun to play because

antisocial is funny to me,” Galiﬁanakis

said

Helms spends the entirety of “The
Hangover” with an unexplained gap
in his front teeth. Interestingiy, it’s an
actualgap in Helms’ smile i

“We actually tried a few alterna-
tives,” Helms said about the gap. “V/e

» med to black it out, we tried a pros-

thetic device that made me look like
a horse”
V, Helms decided ﬁnally to remove
the implant after  the pro-
cedure with his dentist

' The real breakout star of “The
Hangover” seems to be boxer Mike
Tyson, who plays himself.

“It’s very risky,” Cooper’ said ‘‘He’s
not an’ actor, he’s a boxer.”

In rewriting the script, Phillips de-
cided that stealing a  from Mike
Tyson might be a good idea during
some heavy inebriation.

“We weren’t really  fun of
him,” Phillips said. “We were more
like  with his persona and the
image people have of him.”

Tyson performed beyond expecta-
tions, according to the cast, but does he
have a future in comedy? Galiﬁanakis
thinks so.

“As long as he has someone to
punch at the end for the punch line,
he would do ﬁne,” Galiﬁanakis said

I esy Warner Bros. and Frank Masi

The Hangover

Starring: Bradley Coo-
per, Ed Helms, Zach

Dir: Todd Phillips
Warner Bros.

 

It may have seemed impossi-
ble, but ﬁnally the phrases “Mike
Tyson” and “hilarious comedy hit
of the summer” can be uttered
in one earnest sentence.

Like miraculously living
through the best night of hard
partying and suffering none of
the morning-after guilt or sick-
ness, director Todd Phillips’ “The
Hangover” is irreverent and up-
roarious entertainment that keeps
viewers laughing, guessing and
waxing nostalgic about their own
blackout experiences.

Although it would certainly be

Hangover’

hard to top the drunken antics
the ﬁlm’s characters go through
in — most appropriately —— Las
Vegas. And that is something to
be thankful for.

When three buddies wake up
in a destroyed hotel room, physi-
cally ravaged from the previous
night, to find a clucking chicken
in the kitchen, a Bengal tiger in
the bathroom and anlabandoned
baby in the closet, it goes with-
out saying they had an incredible
night. Except one of the guys is
missing a tooth, and their best
friend Doug —— the guy they were
throwing a bachelor party for -—
is nowhere to be found.

And his wedding is less than
48 hours away.

Though the set-up may ap-
pear as a gateway to mediocre
slapstick buddy—comedy, the ﬁlm
fortunately takes the subversive
high road, ultimately yielding a
fresh and truly funny ﬁlm that
proves modern comedy classics

Culture, summer mesh

Three Rivers Arts Festival

June 5 through June 14
www.artsfestiva|.net

Nothing kicks off summer in Pittsburgh like a
healthy dose of the arts
A The Three Rivers Arts Festival will soon 
vast numbers of artist vendor stalls to Downtown
Pittsburgh, allowing art to dominate the city and
bring in the summer season. . A

‘ ‘The Three Rivers Arts Festival presents unique,

diverse, highqualityprogramminginamultittide of
genres, featuring nationally  talent and
the cream of the local crop,” Lauren Bracey, public
relations and  for the Pittsburgh
Cultural Trust, said.

Pittsburgifs traditionalThree Rivers Arts Festival
will welcome its 50th year this summer, and this
 year’s highlights include “more than 50
live music performances, 250 artists in the Artists
Market, an expanded weekend Children’s area, visual
arts exhibitions in 12 Cultural District gallery spaces
and daily ﬁlm screenings, circus performances and
theatiical readings,’ ’ Bracey said.

He added, “Watchingalive concert on the grass
in Point State Park, strolling through the artists’
booths and exhibitions,  a ﬁinnel cake —
for many Pitisburghers, this is the only way to start
summer.”

The festival also includes exhibitions such as
woodwork calligraphy,  animation and glass,
according to its Web site

Vast and numerous, the stretch of the featured
arts canbegraspedwitha\X/eb searchthroughits
online programming Whether searching by day,
by artwork or by place, the chances to experience
something new are readily available

_“New,” however, does not necessarily mean
exotic

“Morethanhalf of the musicalactswepresent

  
  
    

are local,” Bracey said “Many of the artists presented
in our visual arts exhibitions are ﬁom the Pittsburgh
region, and about 40 percent of artists in the Artists

,l\/Iati<etarefrornPennsylvania.”

This offers college artists the opportunity to
enter the scene

“When the festival ﬁrstbeganinthe 1960s, uni-
versity artists and student performing ensembles
were regularly presented,” Bracey said “Festival
exhibitions regulady include the work of local uni-
versity faculty members and students’ ’

The festivalis not limited to Pennsylvania-based
artists It gives everyone — not just Pittsburgh resi-
dents — a chance to explore the arts

Bromance
hﬁsafﬂni
high point

Hangover Review, page 9
need not be touched by the monopolizing
hands of Judd Apatow.

The three hungover friends ——Phil,
Stu and Alan —— are written and directed
so they ‘rise above caricature and, more
importantly, keep one another’s comedy
bits in balance with the overall running-
joke of the ﬁlm. _

In the middle of the outlandish and
potentially life—ruining events the men
suffered during the night of partying
—— and those during the two days after
—-— everyone comes out a better, more
likable person with a stronger bond of
male friendship.

Who said bromantic. sentimentality
couldn’t come wrapped in a smarmy pack-
age of self-awareness? ’

There are times in “The Hangover”
when the stereotypical Vegas setting is
used to almost irritating extreme. Obvi-
ously, someone marries a hooker with
a heart of gold (Heather Graham) in a
24-hour wedding chapel and a successful
gambling plot device sneakily slips the
ﬁlm through its most rusty of narrative
turns.

Thankfully, though, each of these
groan—worthy scenes is either played so
straight or directed in such a novel way,
Vegas becomes a character in the ﬁlm like
we have never seen before. Sorry Nic Cage
—— “The Hangover” will make you want to
do anything but leave Las Vegas.

And make sure to stick around for the
credits. l’ve never seen material run dur-
ing the credits receive laughter as loud
as the actual movie. And when you hear
the audience reaction for the actual ﬁlm,
you’ll realize that’s no easy feat.

Zellous gets ready to play with the pros
F armer Pitt star begins WNBA career

by Lauren Kirschman
Stzzﬁ’ W/riter

When Shavonte Zellous was
drafted as the No. 11 overall pick in
the WNBA Draft, she became Pitt’s
first women’s draft‘ pick in history.
Almost two months later, Zellous
is settling in at her new home with
defending WNBA champion De-
troit Shock.

“It’s been great,” Zellous said. “I
love it to death. Especially on my
team with all the veterans, it’s just
sotdifferent, but I really love it. My
dream has really come true.”

Detroit will play its first regular
season game on June 6 against the
Los Angeles Sparks. It will be Zel-
lous’ first professional game, but
if her preseason performance is
any indication, she’s ready for the
big leagues.

In three preseason games, Zel-
lous averaged 13 points, including
an 18-point performance against the
Chicago Sky. She led all scorers in
that match-up. ‘

Zellous said her biggest chal-

lenge thus far is competing against
bigger guards and defenders. Al-
though she was worried about ad-
justing to the WNBA and playing
with and against veterans, Zellous
said her biggest challenge is yet to
come.

“I really haven’t faced [my big-
gest challenge] yet, because the
games haven’t started,” Zellous said.
“I’m talking about when it’s crunch
time or it’s time to do certain things,
when you need to know this play
and stuff like that. I really.haven’t
faced that yet.”

But her past suggests she’ll be
prepared for her next challenge.

During her years as a Pitt guard,
Zellous said she focused on im-
proving her game for the WNBA.
Last season, Zellous averaged 22.4
points per game, which was sixth
in the country and second in the
Big East. She scored more points
in the opening two rounds of the
NCAA Tournament than any other
player.

She ﬁnished her career at Pitt
with 2,251 points, including a re-

’ cord—setting 747 points in her se-

nior season. Zellous became the
only basketball player — men’s or
women’s — in Pitt history to score
more than 700 points in a single
season. During her historical career
at Pitt, Zellous sharpened her game
for the next level.

“I focused on [improving my

I game] when Iwas at college and that

included extending my range from
the three point line,” Zellous said. “I
still have a little more work to do as
far as my ball handling skills.” I

Malkin's fight could

change momentum

by Greg Trietle
Staﬂ W/riter

Two 3-1 losses into his team’s
series against Detroit, Pittsburgh’s
Evgeni Malkin unleashed his frus-
tration.

The Penguins star fought De-
troit’s Henrik Zetterberg in the fi-
nal minute of Game 2, as tempers
boiled over in a series where the
stars have hit and slashed one an-
other more than they have scored.

Prior to Game 3, the Penguins
scored only twice against the Red

Wings. Malkin and Sidney Crosby
played admirably, but the swarm-
ing Detroit defense contained their
efforts. They couldn’t get space to
make plays thanks to Nicklas Lid-
strom and the rest of the Red Wing
blueliners. T

And even when Crosby or Mal-
kin can make a play, Detroit goal-
tender Chris Osgood shuts them
down. Osgood earned the first star
of the game in both Game 1 and
Game 2 after posting two straight
31 save performances.

Trietle: Role players need to score

Penguins, page 13

Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre
Fleury fell victim in Game 1 to bad
bounces off Detroit’s Joe Louis
Arena boards, which contributed
to two Red Wing goals.

Still, the young goaltender has
yet to make the big saves needed for
this time of year. A third period goal
against in both Game 1 and Game
2 —— a stoppable shot in the latter
case — hindered the Penguins as
they tried to mount comebacks.

Those third period goals were
scored not by a star like Zetterberg
or Marian Hossa, but by 22-year
old rookie Justin Abdelkader. Ab-
delkader picked a great time to score
his first two goals in the NHL. His
impressive play of late reﬂects the
Red Wings’ offensive depth and
their skill on the lower lines.

Detroit hopes that the sound
play from the lower lines contin-
ues in Pittsburgh. Prior to Game 3
in the Steel City, Detroit had just a
4-3 record on the road in the play-
offs. Detroit doesn’t have fan sup-
port, lively end boards or octopus

metaphors away from thejoe Louis
Arena, where the Red Wings are
10-1 in the postseason.

And as the series continues in
Pittsburgh, keep an eye on the fol-
lowing".

The lower lines. Detroit ben-
eﬁted from players like Abdelkader

1 and 2. He went scoreless as he
exchanged hits and frustrated shoves
with Zetterberg. The home team
has the ﬁnal change, so Red 
coach Mike Babcock has to switch
lines, without preparation, to get this
matchup in Pittsburgh. In a game

in the third period. To buck this
trend, Pittsburgh must capitalize
on its late chances and get better
goaltending from Fleury.

Datsyu.k’s return. Detroit took
control of the ﬁnals without its best
forward, Pavel Datsyuk. Datsyuk
hasn’t played since injuring his
foot in Game 2 of the Western
Conference Finals. Up 2-0 in the
series, the Red Wings are bringing
him back slowly, but if the series
tightens up, he probably will play.
Datsyuk changes the dynamic of
the ﬁnals, and Pittsburgh will have
to handle another weapon in the
Detroit lineup.

Ruslan Fedotenko. A winger on
Malkin’s line, Fedotenko has quietly
scored seven goals in the playoffs
before Game 3. Although he isn’t
a sniper, the Penguins veteran has
a penchant to score clutch goals.
Notably, he scored the Cup-winning
goal for Tampa Bay in 2004. The
Penguins would love for Fedotenko
to perform at top level again as the
Stanley Cup Finals continue.

Track and Field

Panthersofﬁcially end season

at NCAA East Regionals .

by Alex Oltmanns
Staff Writer

The Pitt track and ﬁeld team’s season end-
ed last month, but the season ofﬁcially came
to an end for all Panthers this past Weekend,
as none of the seven athletes competing in
the NCAA East Rcgionals advanced to the
National Outdoor Championships.

Coach Alonzo Webb said he felt the team
did not reach its expectations this season
as it had a largely young and inexperienced
team

But Webb also said he feels that with
some of the young runners, such as Cam-
brya Jones and Antony Hobwana, gaining
valuable postseason experience, the team
will improve next season.

Although none of the athletes continued
to the Championships, many had strong
performances at regionals. Mycaiah Clemons
ran- the 100—mctcr hurdles in 13.70 seconds,
good enough for 13th place. Nicole Cherry
ﬁnished 14th in the javelin with a toss of
43.13 meters. Jones ﬁnished eighth in the
200-meter dash with a time of 24.25 sec-
onds. I

Although the collegiate season might
have ended forJones, she will compete in the
Junior Outdoor Championships in Eugene,
Ore., later this month with top national run-
ners ranging from age 14 to 20.

SeniorJancssa Murphy also competed at
the event, leaping 5.87 meters in the long
jump to ﬁnish 16th. Brianna Broylcs was
the last member of the women’s team at
rcgionals. The junior ﬁnished the 400—metcr
hurdles in 1:04.87, which placed her 40th in
the preliminary round but didn’t qualify her
for the ﬁnals.

On the mcn’s side, the best ﬁnish came
from senior Eric Jones, who ﬁnished 27th
in the triple jump with a leap of 14.25 me-
ters. Sophomore Hobwana also competed at
the event, ﬁnishing 21 st in the preliminary
round of the 100—meter dash with a time
of 10.65 seconds. He didn’t qualify for the
ﬁnal round.

The members of the team are all home
for the summer, but Webb said they all have
an intense workout program to help them
stay in shape for when they return to Oak-
land in the fall.
