‘ Do. Co|legeiStuiden’rs Think? A

 

Conformity a

By Deborah Willson _

Conformity among college students (ah, I can
hear the screams of dispair at those words!) is by
now a pretty hackneyed topic. Apropos of this,
however, in an exceptionally en— ’
lightened class discussion the
other day, a professor raisedvan
interesting’ question.
‘ ‘*“Why*is it,” he asked, “that
in every country but the United
States, most young people be-
tween the ages of 18 and 24 are
socialists? This seems an inevit-
able result of their ‘beginning to
think’; why does it not happen
here?”

in the fact that -anything termed “socialistic” has
become such anathema in this country that even
the students avoid, it like the plague.

WE IN THIS country have stood back and
watched’ half the world adopt some form of social-
ism, and 1ose'a good deal of freedom in the process.
Our reaction has been, ideologically,,to draw up
our skirts. around us and say, “That won’t happen
here!” How could college students oppose such vio-
lent odds as these? _ _

Come to think ‘of it, though, aren’t there equal,
or perhaps greater, dangers in being a‘ Socialist
in countries other than our own? What about areas
of Europe now freed from a tyranny whose power
was based on radical political philosophy such as
Nazism?

In some of these countries it may be even phys-'

ically dangerous to be at “free thinker,” a political
radical. Surely students in such areas face greater
odds than in America, where an avowed Socialist
may be ostracized, but will probably not be shot.

NO — THERE MUST be some other reason
than fear of social disapproval per se that more of
our young people do not espouse some radical
political creed, be it socialism or enforced vege-
tarianism Is it possible that our answer lies in the
old cry of conformity? “ i \ -

In.Europe, though students and adults alike are
presumably afraid of being shot, they‘ do not seem
to fear “being different.” I can not attempt to ex-
plain why this is so, but it certainly seems to _be.
France is a good example of a country where peo-
ple are not fearful of being different, at’ least

politically, if the number of parties she had until

 

I ‘ Wednesday, May’2".',i 1959-—THE PITT NEws‘—rage 3

 

My\ﬁrst impulse -was to say that the reason lay I

  

 

ncl Socialism

recently is any indication.

Politics in this country, however, is only one
more area where people fear any greatdivergence.
Oh sure, I’ve heard students argue about the Re-
publicans and Democrats, too, but did you ever.

' meet a Socialist party defender?

FOR THAT MATTER, how many people do you
know who think seriously about any political
theory? After, thinking about things like that —
it makes you diﬂerent — nobody does that, it’s
just for “out of it” people!

This seems to be the real root of the problem.
Perhaps it is because life is too easy for us. “We
have more than enough to eat, cars, good clothes
— who cares whether democracy and capitalism
are the best things for humanity -— all I want to
do is make a good living — that’s all I ask.

This takes effort, but a “good living” is prob-
ably not something that can be achieved by a
political “radical.” After all, who wants to hire a
fanatic? '

THIS FEAR OF being different — of oblivion
to serious thought — seem to penetrate almost
every area pf college life.

In poiltical areas especially, little serious
thought is given. At a recent Associated Collegiate
Press Conference, many thought national politics

had no place in a college newspaper at all. Now,.

I ask you, how oblivious can you get? ,

Even students who do attempt serious discus-
sion on any topicat all, politics or religion, show a
curious disinclination to be associated with a par-
ticular stand. This point was brought out very
sharply by Peter Viereck in “The Shame and Glory
of the Intellectuals.” '

VIERECK POINTS OUT that college students
will not espouse any cause, or will do so only
reluctantly. They strive for “objectives,” suaveness
and ‘sophistication as far as creeds and ideals go.
They will not even ﬁght against socialism, let
alone advocate it seriously. »

The question now is, where does this all lead?
How far can sophistication, detachment and fear
to espouse a cause go? Will the college students
when they are our “leaders of tomorrow” sit back
detachedly and watch our world crumble?

Failure to think seriously has already gotten us
into serious trouble, nationally and internationally.
Perhaps we would do well to heed Viereck when
he says, “Suaveness is the only unforgiveable
gaucheness.” ‘

’59_ Owl ‘Reviewed,’ I»
Called Inane, Vapid

Editor, The Pitt News:

The 1959 Owl belongs in a___

"tree —- any tree". It is full of in-
spired nonsense. After all, you
can get a real stuffed owl at any
reasonable taxidermist for less
than $8.28; and with Grade A
horsefeathers, too. - V '

The word for this book is, I
think, gross. $8.28 is one hell of
a price topay for an assortment
of photos of unidentiﬁed people
walking, talking, sniffing bottles,

kissing, getting drunk at frater— I

nity parties, being led blind-
folded, lighting candles
playing touch football in sports
coats. V L
This book is far too long to
permit me to attempt a thorough
review. One can,‘ however, get
‘an idea of ‘what I mean by in-
sipid nonsense by turning to the
section which supposedly "con-
cernsit self with the School of
Liberal Arts,_ pp.262—63. Here
can be found photographs with
captions that are typical of this
vapid book. Let me quote a

and ‘

in a Universitly window, signi-
ﬁes the process
(H o w?) “Student conferences
often crystallize disorganized
ideas into compact theory.” (Oh,
do they?) “Precise laboratory

-work helps develop Liberal Arts

student to think more clear]-y
and logically.” (Oh, come now.)
This type of inane caption
"coupled with, for the most" part,
trite photographs, make the

“  teams’ chances for a NCAA tour-

' I f‘It will be a crime if we aren’t

_ —“'State once and should have won
0’ the second game. This is the best

i_ team that I have ever coached,
and they have done everything
 that a manager could ask for.
"'They just have to get the bid or

else," Lewis moaned. ’

At’ 4:22 Cook made the fol-
lowing statement over the Field

. House public address system.
 . “The four teams that have been ’
‘ selected for the NCAA District 2
playoffs are ‘Penn State, Ithaca,
-Temple . . .” and then after a
long pause, “Pitt.” ‘
Everyone present seemed to be
jubilant as Lewis, and they all
, ‘tried to congratulate him at the
 same time. “Without a doubt this
‘*T.is the happiest moment of my
coaching career at Pitt,” Lewis
shouted, “Now I hope and pray
that we can makea respectable
showing.” ~
.. ‘The news immediately was
transferred to the Panther. mitters.
The general reaction among them
was," “This is really great news,
"but I can’t believe that it’s true.
V lWe’ll do all right in the tourna-
’ ment and should win it. I deﬁnite-

-i ' Shortstop George Schoeppner,

‘ comment-ed, “We’ll play , these

have preferred to play State,.
‘ but I suppose that Ithaca will be
just as tough. I would’-ve really
-been hurt if 'We hadn’t been

_ “This is it. If we give all we’ve
got, we’ll take Ithaca. That’s the

Ten Thinclads . ~-
To IC4/1 .Mee_t

By JACK SMITH

For the past week Coach
Carl’ Rees has been preparing
his trackmen for the IC4A
track meet which will be held
this weekend in New York
City. The Panthers, who man-

‘aged to place two men and a re-
lay ‘team in last year’s meet,

ship since the days of John Wood-
ruff back in 1938-39. 0

Speedy Mel Barnwell is the only
returning Panther who placed in
last year’s races. Barnwell took
a third in both the 100' and 220-
yard- dashes. According to Rees,
though, Jay Moody, low hurdles,
and Ron Rush, mile, should take
a championship place. .

Doesn’t Expec't First

“I don’t expect to take ﬁrst
place,” Rees commented, “But I
do expect agood representation
from the ten men I am taking.
-You can bet that we will give the

-team leaders some trouble.”

Bill Hinchberger and Zinne-
ford Smith will be taken along
to run the half-mile, but it" is
doubtful that either will place
since the best, time of either’
runner is only 1:54.’? seconds. —

In ﬁeld events Ed Vamos will
be entered in the.broad jump.
Vamos, who did 23 feet, 71/2 inches’
in his win against West Virginia
will have to equal or better that
mark in his ‘jumps against some
of the best contestants in the
East. -

Like Vamos, Larry Och, who
threw ‘the shot put 51 feet, 31/4
inches, will have to better him-
self in order to place against the
stiﬁ competition that is expected
in the .-IC4A’s this year.

In the discus the Cats will go
with Dan Kanell, a consistent
winner all year. “Kanell, who is
about fourth best in\the East,
could place or even win,” Rees‘
said. ‘ i H .
The other trackmen who are

expected to make the traveling
team are Lee Progner, John Chris-
tof and Vince ,Wojnar. ‘ '

The Blue and Gold ﬁnished the
dual meet season with two wins
and _three losses. '
