Montgomery Alabama officials removed
the barricades to the capitol and students im-
mediately began the long sought march-on-the-
capitol, as a protest of discriminatory voter
registration policies in Alabama. Police stopped
the march after the students had progressed
six blocks. ‘
5:30 pm.

The officers withdrew and the students again be-
gan to march on the capitol. State troopers on horse-
back stopped the demonstrators, who staged a sit
down. Many of the students carried bed-rolls and
blankets, apparently prepared for a marathon sit-
down.

800 Gather in Oakland March
To Honor Memory of Rev. Reeb

By MARSHA linens and JACKI KATZ

Nearly 80 area students and
Pittsburgh citizens rallied,
marched, and worshipped Satur-
day in memory of Reverend
James Reeb of Boston who was
killed while in Sehna, Alabama.
Beginning at 12:30 p.m. in the
quadrangle, the rally terminated in

Heinz Memorial Chapel.

Summing up the feelings of the
other speakers at the rally, Dr. David
Montgomery, Assistant Professor of
History, declared that the demonstra-
tion on the death of Reverend Reeb
brought “home the question of respon-
sibility of each man in the struggle

for civil l.iberties.f’

Dr. Montgomery pointed out that
the heads of state have a responsibil-
ity in the movement in Alabama. The
yellow roses sent to Mrs. Reeb by the"
President “mark the abdication of re-

sponsibility,” he said.

He continued that Governor Wal-
lace of Alabama had used the power
of the state to block the right to vote,

supporting this law.”

“Freedom Now’

and that the governor viewed the law
as a means of defense of whites
against Negroes. “The murderers of
Reverend Reeb felt that they were

Montgomery asserted that
when Constitutional rights are denied
by the “governmental authority of
Alabama, it is the responsibility of
Washington to reach the governor”
through presidential inﬂuence, through
congress, and "through the Demo-
cratic party and to let Wallace “know
with whom he is reckoning.”

  
   

nities in Alabama”

hoses, and dogs.”

If every Alabaman can vote, Dr.
Montgomery concluded, new law en-
forcers will be elected and demon-
strations will no longer be necessary.

Nate Firestone, campus coordina-
tor of the Americans for Democratic
Action, cited the “monstrous evil in
the South today” and stated that the
ralliers had both moral and prag-
matic reasons for being present.

The former, he+said,~-was to “pro-
test the brutal inequities and indig-
perpetrated in
the name of law. The latter was to
let Washington and the world know
that “such atrocities will not be tol-
erated” and that “Selma is not Amer-
ica and we do not condone bull prods,

Byrd Brown, president of the Pitts-
burgh chapter of the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Col-
ored people, stressed that, the Satur-
day rally was to protest conditions
not only in Alabama but also in Pitts-
burgh and at the University.

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17,1965  L

Alabama Governor, George Wallace spoke to the
group, asking that they disband.

A local deputized posse came upon a group of 
students standing and singing outside of the Student .
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee’s headquarters in
Montgomery—the Hotel Bendmoor. According to Linda .
Watts, Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee I 
Chairman from Chatham College, the posse on horse-  L.‘
back surrounded the students and began trampling *1
and beating them; tear gas guns were ﬁred into the I

Several individuals required medical attention
which the Medical Commission on Human Rights pro- 
vided. Although the ﬁrst of three buses which left the 
University for Montgomery was on the scene, no one ‘ 
from Pittsburgh was injured.

(Telephone conversation with John Meely, Stu-. 
dent Non-Violent Coordinating Committee member 
from Mississippi revealed further observations on the
local posse.) “People had peacefully marched and all I
of a sudden horsemen charged up on the students; ’- 
men corraled the students into private homes by beat-
ing them with billy clubs; there is utter pandemonium
now . . . Wait! the people are coming out of the homes
and I can’t tell what’s going to happen.”

The second and third buses are reported near‘ 
Birmingham, Alabama. They will arrive in Montgom-
ery within two hours.

Telephone conversation with Miss Watts revealed
that the night and people are subdued; she conﬁrmed
that no member of the Pittsburgh party is -injured; all
have been fed and are housed in Montgomery, cour- ‘C
tesy of local citizens. -

An outburst interrupted the conversation. Miss
Watts discovered that students on the campus of the

800 Gather in Walk
To Honor Rev. Reeb

(Continued from Page 1)

Among other speakers asking
for continued action to “make
freedom universal” so ' that “or-
ganizations such as the NAACP
are no longer necessary” were
Student Government President-
elect Eric Stem» H1158 Wam-
uiatham student and president of
the P811. Friends of the Stu-
dent Non-violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC), and Ralph
Proctor, executive secretary of

" the University Chapter of the

NAACP.

Miss Watts speciﬁcally asked
for participation in a march last
Sunday and in national demon-
strations in either Washington or
Selma.

Councilman Craig Kuhn, speak-

 ing on behalf of Mayor Joseph
‘T Barr, who was unable to attend
. the rally, called for a continuance
5, of the words “freedom and equal-

ity” in the Declaration of. Inde-

_ _j pendence and thanked the assem-
" bly in the name of the mayor for

the “exceptionally moving thing.”

lFollowing the speeches, Proc-
tor asked the ralliers to march
silently two -.abreast to Heinz
Chapel for the memorial service.
The marchers, many of whom
were carrying placards, walked
around the block on which the
Chapel and Cathedral are located
and proceeded to the chapel. The
line extended the length of the
Fifth Avenue block between Big-
elow Blvd. and Belleﬁeld Ave-
nue and part way down Bene-
ﬁeld Avenue.

The purpose of the inter-faith
memorial service was not only
in memory of Reverend Reeb,
but also “to remember all who

. have given their lives, limbs,

hearts, energy, dignity, and self
respect in the civil rights strug-
gle.”

Following prayers and read-
ings from the Old and New Testa-
ments, Father Christopher Ken-
nedy, Roman Catholic Chaplain
at the Oratory of St. Philip Neri,
said that in being silent, the
Church “w.as repeating the si-
lence of the totalitarian govern-
ment of the Christians in Nazi
Germany.

“The Church is at fault. We
are preaching God loves the world
and we are also preaching to love
as Jesus did—to the death. I
have always argued civil rights
and preached them. I have al-
ways worked, lived with, and
been close to Negroes, but I also
know that I have never laid my

 life on the line.”

Father Kennedy was one of the
clergymen to go to Selma last
week. “Perhaps,” he said, “our

' presence there forstalled further

"violence. We were not called on

“ to offer any sacriﬁce except one,

Reverend Reeb. The rest of the
people did not give much, but

A . . they received much—an increased

sense of sensitivity and deep ad-
miration for the exquistive wis-

Qdom and love shown by the Ne-

xgroes of the country.”
Reverend Mr. Edward C. Bie-
gert, Presbyterian and United

1 Church of Christ Chaplain, was
_  also one of the clergy to go to
' ._ Alabama last week. He felt that

 
   
 
   
   
     
  

Saturday’s gathering was differ-
ent from the gathering on No-
_’vember 25, 1963—the memorial
service for President Kennedy.
. “Then we were sad. We are
here today to affirm that which
is nvins. to involve‘ ourselves in

x‘.

 

spirit is alive. You cannot kill the
human spirit. The dead is in the
twisted minds and poisoned spir-
its of people like Governor Wal-
lace and Sheriff James Clark (of
Selma).

“The death is not in the faces
of those who march, but inthose
white and black, who watched.
If you can sit by and watch in-
justice .and inequality, you are
dead."

Reverend Biegert feels that the

Church and the clergy have been

dead until recently. “We have
heard from you people that we
have been irrelevant and you
were right. It is not a matter of
agitation, but dedication. If we
are to live we must come to
know this also.” '

In the third statement of con-
cern given during the service,
Proctor asserted that there is
“far more to education than
books, scholarships, and what you
can get out of the academic
world. Too often we are led to
believe that if we take a stand
on something we are not putting
enough time on our books.

“Don’t fear the loss of a schol-
arship or a loan, fear the loss of
yourself for failing to act. Peo-
ple say you are the leaders of
tomorrow. I don’t buy that, I
don’t want you to buy that. You
are the leaders of today. Be a
leader.”

A message from Vice-Chancel-
lor Helen Pool Rush was read
during the service. In it she ex-
pressed her pride in the Univer-
sity students for recognizing the
death of a man who “lost his life
fora sacred cause.”

The memorial march w.as pub-
licized by posters and ﬂyers dis-
tributed in the dorms. Listed on
the ﬂyers as supporting the march
were the University Qihaplains of
the University, Tech, Chatham
College, Mount Mercy, and Du-
quesne University; faculty mem-
bers of the University’s history,
biology, anatomy, and English
departments, as well as Dean
Thomas M. Cooley of the Uni-
versity Law School; SG President
John Vrana; and Eric Stern, SG
president-elect.

The rally was planned by Proc-
tor and members of the NAACP
Friday after they received word
of Reverend Reeb’s death. They
had already been in the process
of planning for a. demonstration
concerning Selma later this week.

president of Pittsburgh Friends
of SNCC. The Montgomery spokes-
man explained that they were
trying to organize a mass dem-
onstration for Monday at the

_ Montgomery state capitol build-

ing to support the pleas of those
citizens trying to march from
Selma to Montgomery.

Paul DuBois, one of the or-
ganizers of the trip, was called
by Miss Watts Sunday afternoon
and news of the planned trip
spread around campus by word
of mouth. “Eric Stern was very
helpful in offering the support
and authority of his office in
publicizing the demonstration and
in trying to get heads of depart-
ments to excuse those going from
classes,” DuBois said.

“Eric said that he received ap-
proval from the heads of the his-
tory, mathematics, political sci-
ence, romance language, and phil-
osophy departments for the stu-
dents to miss class,”.DuBois con-
tinued.

The ﬁrst bus left ‘at 8:20 p.m.
with 39. people and the second
and third buses left at 2:30 .a.m.
with approximately 90 people.
Devra Davis, an organizer of the
trip, organized the second and
third buses and made arrange-
ments for the payments.

According to DuBois, 18 bus
lines were called in attempts to
get a bus and only three indi-
cated that they were willing to
send .a bus to Alabama. The ﬁrst
bus was obtained without much
trouble at 3 p.m.

“We had a great deal of trou-
ble getting the other two buses
from Greyhound,” DuBois said.
“They held up the second bus
until they had the third one. Both
buses left together after the driv-
ers refused to accept student
checks.”

Previously DuBois and Miss
Davis ordered a 43 passenger bus.
When they discovered that there
were enough people for a third
bus, they made arrangements to
get two 38 passenger buses which
would .arrive at midnight. Due to
the change of plans, however,
these were an hour late.

When the driver refused to ac-
cept student checks as payments
for the trip, Miss Davis and Bob
Cunningham, a night desk assis-
tant in Holland Hall and a Uni-

 \..

for the Reverend Reeb who died from a beating he suﬁered at the
hands of a group of men in Selma, Alabama. The march, starting from

the -Quadrangle and «progressing «to the Chapel.  led by Ralph

 

versity student, contacted Dr.
and Mrs. Litchﬁeld and explain-
ed the problem to them. The
Chancellor arranged to open the
University safes to cash the
checks.

“The Chancellor said they
couldn’t underwrite the trip, but
that they would support it to the
extent of cashing checks,” Du-
Bois explained.

John Bender, assistant director
of Men’s Housing, authorized Ron
Shearer, night desk assistant in
the Towers, to use the cash in
the Towers safe in cashing the
checks. He also contacted Charles
Douglas, head of Saga Food Serv-
ice, who agreed to come into the
University and open the Saga
safe if more money were needed.

The money received from the
Towers safe, plus the cash paid
by the students, and $150 collect-
ed from Holland Hall residents
was enough to pay for ‘the buses.

Acting in her capacity as Dean
of "Women, Helen Pool Rush ex-
plained that those women.‘ stu-
dents who wished to go to Mont-
gomery had to go through nor-
mal procedures to leave the
dormitories, that is, they had to
have their parent’s permission
and they had to check out of the
dormitories.

“It is more than dormitories at
stake,” Dean Bush said, “they
have class responsibilities. We
are always pleased when students
take an interest in social issues,
but we want them to go through
legal and orderly processes.

“We want people to use their
energies in ways that will count
and will not endanger themselves
and others,” she continued.

Feelings of those boarding and
waiting to board buses ran from
a desire “to be part of a college
movement” to needs “t0 Show
Governor Wallace how the nation
feels” and “to fulﬁill my obliga-
tions to my fellow man.”

Mahmoud Mamadami, Universi-
ty foreign student, believed that
“the question now in the South
is not only an American problem

but a. human problem” which he"

wanted to help solve.

'Eric Stern, Student Govern-
ment President-elect felt that
“this would help to solidify the
Civil Rights movement and he
needed to reaffirm a belief in the
ultimate value of all men.”

Kathleen Sweeney from Mt.
Mercy cautioned that “everyone
should be sensible. We shouldn't
go down there to cause any more
trouble than they have now.”
Father Xavier Carroll also of Mt.
Mercy was going “to stand in
witness with the colored resi-
dents in Alabama.”

Dick Becker, member of the
Hill Education Project, stated
that he was not scared and that
being in jail did not concern him.
He was going to set an example
in defense of civil liberties.

As he boarded the ﬁrst bus,
Rabbi Richard Rubenstein, Uni-
versity Chaplain and lecturer on
French Ikistentialism, requested,
“Tell my class I'm not meeting
with them tomorrow."

DuBois was hoping “to get the
government to let the residents
walk the 50 miles that they want
to."

Commenting on a rumor that
he had issued a. directive asking

teachers to excuse the students

going to Alabama from tests and
classes they would miss, Chancel-
lor Litchﬁeld stated that although

he was in favor of the students_

demonstrating and showing what
they thought, he could “under no
circumstances declare a holiday”
and thereby make the trips “in-
stitutional nmtter."

Ralph Proctor, executive sec-
retary of the University chapter
of National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP) feels that “though I
did not think much of the organ-
ization of the trip, I am happy
that so many Pitt students went.

“It has been a job trying to get
Pitt students involved in any
great number. I have much more
respect for those who went than
for those who sitback and criti-
cize. At least they’re trying to

_ do something.”

Proctor feels that the students
who went are as safe as they
could be on any demonstration.
“Any Civil Rights demonstration.
whether northern or southern, is
dangerous. They should go into
it with full knowledge that it is
dangerous and they might get
hurt.

“If they are going just to get
out of class and think it is just
a lark,” he continued, “I would
rather they stay home."

Proctor, head of the University’s NAACP chapter. The march con-

tained some 800 to 1,000 marchers. The action by the students was a
prelude to the chartering of buses the next night which went to

Concert, Luncheon, Dance Draws

Successful Greek Week to Close

Awards, dancing and music were the interests of fraternity and sorority mem-
bers during the last two days of Greek Week.

Pianist Peter Nero was a more than adequate emergency replacement for the
Brothers Four at the concert Friday night at Carnegie Music Hall. Nero effectively pre-
sented his own arrangements of pieces such as “I Could Have Danced All Night” which

he began by playing the theme from a Strauss waltz.
The tempos varied from the light and leisurely “People” to the fast beats of “Two Base Hits”

where drummist Joe Cassetes beat out a powerful solo. For an encore Nero played his arrangement
of “Over The Rainbow,” which seemed to delight the audience.

Before the second part of the program began, Norm Himes and Beverly Lichter, outgoing presi-
dents of Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) and Pan-Hellenic Council respectively, presented Mr. Frank
Wantanabee of the YMCA with a tape recorder bought by their councils. The tape recorder will be
used for recording reading materials for blind students at the University.

This was followed by the tapping ceremonies for the order of Omega. The tappees were: Ed
Miguelucci, Pi Kappa Alpha and president-elect of IFC; Richard Minker, Pi Lambda Phi and co-chair-
man of Greek Week 1965; Ken Frederick, sigma Alpha Epsilon and IFC vice-president - elect; Rich
Bruni, Phi Kappa Theta, and outgoing secretary of IFC; and Jim Smith of Delta Sigma Phi.

At the luncheon on Saturday at the Park Sc henley Omega also tapped Dean of Men William B.
Crafts and Professor of English Lawrence Lee as honorary members. Professor Lee served as faculty
advisor of Zeta Beta Tau.

Also at the luncheon the sorority scholarship award, presented to the sorority with the highest
overall average was presented Sigma Delta Tau. Figures for the highest over.all fraternity average
were incomplete.

Norm Himes was the recipient of the Mr. IFC award and was also honored for his service as
president of IFC during the past year. At the lunch eon the officers of IFC for the coming year were
sworn 111. ‘

An innovation this year was the presentation of IFC Certiﬁcates of Merit to students who have
made “an outstanding contribution to the fraternity system.” Two women were given honorary awards:
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Helen Pool Rush and Kathy English, who served as co-chairman of
Greek Week 1965. *

Dean Crafts, Professor Lee and Dr. Alan C. Rankin, vice chancellor for student and general
affairs, were also recipients of Certiﬁcates of Merit.

Also honored with a. certiﬁcate were Richard Bruni, James A. Coll, Gerry Cruikshank, Ken
Frederick, Jim Golding, Norm Himes, Danny Katz, Jack Kolury. Al Malasky, Ed Mastena Jim Mastrian.
Ed Miguelucci, Dick Minker, Jim Moyer, George .’russi1i, Jim Smith, Richard Snyder, John Vrana
and Jerry Wische.

Greek Week Queen Sylvia Shapiro with the assistance of her co-chairman of Greek Sing, Al
Malasky, armounced the Greek Sing Awards. Alp ha Kappa Alpha captured first place in the sororites
for their presentation of “Lift Every Voice.” Phi Sigma Sigma took second and Kappa Kappa Gamma
third. '

In the fraternity sing competition Pi Lambda ._Phi copped ﬁrst place for their rendition of a
George M. Cohan medley which was replete with drum and ﬂag. Second place winner was Sigma

Ball Finishes Spectacular Greek Week

“Best College Hoax” Snares
Greeks at Awards Luncheon

For about an hour the 150 peo-
ple at the Greek Week Lunch-
eon sat in amused amazement.
Dr. Robert Johnson, the guest
speaker, was telling an audience
of dedicated Greeks that frater-
nities are simply “perpetuating
an age old problem by their
existence.”

But the Greek men and women
came to the defense of their sys-
tem. Sylvia Shapiro, standing
tall and erect, eloquently attack-
ed Dr. Johnson’s View that fra-
temities and sororities are in-
sular and said they are like “a

family, but a family of individ-
uals.”

Soon all came clear. Michael
Kornblatt, chairman of the lunch-
eon, said after the speech that
he would like to thank Dr. John-
son, but he couldn't since Dr.
Johnson didn't exist.

Dr. Johnson was indeed Rob-
ert McCulley of a local public
relations ﬁrm. In the words of
Parker Enwright, “This was the
best college hoax I'd heard of
anywhere.”

“DR. J HNSON” attacks sororities and fraternities as archaic and

   

useless organizations as bewildered Greek Week luncheon audience
listens. It was later disclosed that “Dr. Johnson”.was really Robert

Reeb Recalled
 Old Friend

Editor, The Pitt News:

At the march and chapel serv-
ice on Saturday the living spirit
of the civil rights movement
clearly predominated over the
_;.;_, memory of the dead James Reeb.
 , I am far too involved, personally,
in the fortunes of the Negro com-
munity to complain about this
 spirit. As —a former parishioner
 I‘ of the deceased, however, I am
writing to say a few things about
him. '

It was not in Boston that I
knew him, but in Washington, be-
tween 1961 and 1963, when he

‘_ was Associate Minister at All

’ » Souls Church, Unitarian, and I
attended there. He was a friend-
ly man who seemed to be thor-
oughly' absorbed in the young
people in his church and in the
predominantly Negro community
which surrounded the church.

 

In one sermon he stressed the
* need - which young people (es-
I pecially of high school age) have
V for model persons on whom they
‘ ' can pattern their lives and on
 , the failure of our age to produce
"5  such models. Perhaps his death
can serve to dramatize the fact
the civil rights movement is pro-
producing exemplars, men of
compassion and commitment.

 

 

In another sermon he discussed
the affirmation, “I want to be a
man.’_’ Making it clear that being
L. -. a man was more important to
 him than being a clergyman, he
 said that part of what it meant
’  was living each day as if it were
' going to be your last.

 In this Reebianism there lies a
" ‘real challenge for us students, I
.- . think. Of course, we’re not sel-
 ﬁsh. Just ask us! Later on, when
‘- we're not under such pressure,
 of course, we will do kind, gen-
erous, and altruistic things. But
not now. Right now we are con-
‘ cerned with our bank accounts
 and with our QPA’s, which might
 be called our academic bank ac-
5 " counts. We are procrastin.ating,
 and we are living lives which, if
 they were cut off tomorrow,

 would be meaningless.
‘ Another Reebianism deserves
_mention. A ceremony was be
 held to announce his promo-
tion from Assistant to Associate

 

 

  
     
  

who stayed to organize, are to be commended for this tremendous show of personal feeling

Minister. When the appropriate
moment came for Mr. Reeb to
say something he startled at
least .a few ears with a public

statement of personal commit-

ment: “Whatever I have, I will
give.” Most people do not go
around saying things like that,
but injustice in this country will
be with us until others give as
much as James Reeb has given.

Student Praises
Saga Cafeteria

Editor, The Pitt News:

Saga Food ‘recently received
“an assortment of 17 complaints”
concerning the quality of their
food and service. I, as a student
employee of Saga Food, would
like to issue some complaints
about student attitudes and ac-

tions in the cafeteria. In doing’

this, I would also offer some sug-
gestions to the student on how
he might help improve the cafe-
teria situation. "

We hear complaints about long
lines and waiting in lines. True,
there are times when food has to
be changed on the steam table;
this requires little time and is a
necessity. Otherwise, and if it
were up to the employees, lines
would move at maximum speed.

.However, when a student, yell-
ing tolsomeone back in the lines,
stumbles forward and before de-
ciding on his dish asks “What’s
this and this and this?” move-
ment is bound to be slow. Menus
have been posted at conspicuous
places so that no one should need
to ask “What's this?” I maintain
that, if the customer reads the
menu as he advances, tells the
leading server just what he
wants, and moves on, the line
would move much faster,

“Elderly women in the cafe-
teria are sassy to students.” I'm
not Saying they are, but I would
venture to say that in some cases
they certainly have the right to
be. Most studentsare polite and
rather considerate as they pass
through the serving line. Some
are not. Instead of “P11 have

some roast beef, please,” it’s__

    

“Gimmie some of ‘that junk,
whatever it is.”

Furthermore, after every meal,
literally dozens of trays are left
on the tables; food and glasses
are strewn here and there. Ash
trays might be ﬁlled with orange
drink or mashed potatoes and
sugar bowls used as containers
for bones and other scraps of
meat. Every night at least one
prankster removes the lid from
the salt or pepper shaker and
turns the shaker upside; down on
the table-—to'be lifted. by an em-
ployee’ and result in" a mess
which is quite difficult to clean.
I should think this childishness
would make anyone cr.anky. i

As for quantity and quality of
food served, I think students
should keep in mind that this is
a cafeteria and not a home or a
restaurant. In comparison with
most colleges, we have excellent
food. Some friends from a near-
by school visiting me here were
amazed to ﬁnd that we .are served
ice cream at every meal; they
couldn’t get over the idea of sec-
onds. At this particular school,

students receive one standard«

portion of meat and vegetables
and have a choice of maybe two
desserts and two salads.

I’m not saying that Saga Food
is perfect, but I do think that
they are playing their part pretty
well. It's time for students to-
realize that they also have a part

"to play.

The conflagration in Selma, Alabama, -has triggered an
unprecedented activism and political consciousness here at
the University.

D On Saturday afternoon, our chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP) sponsored a rally, a protest march, and a mem-
orial service on behalf of those persons who have lost their
lives in t h e civil rights rev-
olution — and speciﬁcally, of course,
to honor the late Reverend ,James
Reeb, the Unitarian minister from
Boston, who last week was brutally
murdered by racists in Selma.

On Sunday; evening, over 100 stu-
dents and clergymen from the Pitts-
burgh area responded to a plea is-
ued by the Student Nonviolent Co-
ordinating Committee (SNCC) to
stage a protest demonstration Tues-
day in Montgomery, the state capital
of Alabama.

IN REFERENCE to the Montgomery bus ride, I would
concede that the motives of many of the participants were
somewhat less than mature, and that the thrust of the
movement was supplied not by a sophisticated understand-
ing of the Negro’s problems and prospects, but‘ rather by a
quixotic, Fort Lauderdale-like adventurism.

 

It may well be true that only a fraction of the Pitts-

' burgh “freedom riders” were genuinely aware of the issues

at stake in the Alabama tragedy (to be sure, the ubiquitous
guitars did nothing to dignify the project) ; but despite the
almost messianic zeal of most of these students, the strug-
gle to which they are actively committed remains morally
and constitutionally unshakable. In other words, the moral
and constitutional efficacy of the Montgomery protest (and
of the national civil rights revolution) is never signiﬁcantly
diminished by the presence of the naive,.the immature or
the unknowing. It is far better, I would argue, to err in the
spirit of compassion than to cackle cynically and mindlessly
on the sidelines. -

The leaders of SN CC and the Southern Christian Lead-

, ers-hip Conference believe, and properly so, that the explo-

sive situation in Alabama should be dealt with directlyby
the President of the United States (i.e., that Federal troops‘ '
should be sent to Selma). In the wording of the United
States Code (Title 10, Section 333), Presidential interven-
tion is warranted in situations in which “domestic violence,
unlawful combination or conspiracy” deprives “any part or
class” of the people of a state of “equal protection of the
law.” The Alabama authorities have obviously failed to
guarantee not only the right of citizens to vote, but also
the right to ‘assemble peacefully in order to protest that

. disenfranchisement.

IT IS the belief of the civil rights leadership that a
mass inﬂux of Northern college students and clergymen
intensiﬁes the Selma crisis, and thereby increases the likeli-
hood of prompt Presidential action. P

Parenthetically, I am personally convinced that the
enthusiasm which was so apparent ‘here on Sunday demon-
strates once again that American college students constitute
a potential reservoir of political power. Dr. Martin Luther
King, James Farmer, et. al. have repeatedly conceded that
if it were not for the college student, there would not be any
meaningful civil rights movement; yet these leaders never
made a direct appeal for student support.

If, for example, the civil rights leaders would call for
a student march on Washington this weekend, to demand

Federal intervention. iiiii Alabama, the current “spring .

fever,” general alienation, and si_ncere devotion to civﬂ
rights would combine’ to assure an: enormous turnout of
collegians. Few would understand precisely why they were
marching, but thousands would march nonetheless. '

There are, then, a myriad of reasons why a student
participates in civil rights activity. Some may really under-
stand the situation; others may be acting in accordance
with their consciences; and still others may join in simply
because it is the “collegiate” thing to do. But regardless of
their motives, their solidarity and unityof purpose make
the students a political force that cannot be dismissed

lightly.

By BARRY SHAW

Possibly the most delight-
ful concert of the year was
given at Syria Mosque by the
Pittsburgh Symphony this
week—end. The program, con-
sisting of ‘Berlioz’ “Sym-
phonic Fantastique,” Mo-
zart's “Piano Concerto No. 27,”
and Chabrier’s “Espana,” was
conducted by Paul Paray.

Hector Berlioz’ often- played -

“Symphonie Fantastique” is a
work that has caused controversy
ever since its introduction. Her-
alding the Romantic movement as
it did, its sometimes obvious
structure occasioned r em arks
from most musical circles of the
time. It stood, however, as one of
the pieces of music that later Ro-
mantics were to emulate. In the
present state of antipathy to-
ward Romanticism, it is well to
go back and consider Berlioz as
the important ﬁgure that he is.

Paul Paray brought out all the
orchestral colorings as well as
the gusto and fortitude of Ber-

pi...1.....,,1. Symphony  

 

lioz’ composition in his perform-
ance. Since the only continuity
in the piece is the ﬁxed idea
which represents the artist’s be-
loved in various settings, it is an
absolute necessity that the or-
chestral variations be brought
out. Paray did this superbly. Al-
so, he made a ﬁne use of rhy-
thmic dynamics, slowing the piece
down to a very slow pace, and
then speeding it up again rapid-
ly to add interest. ‘

The second movement, “A Ball’
was done with graceful Viennese
lilt, and the ﬁnal movement,
“Witches Sabbath” was as grotes-
que and arousing‘ as could be
desired.

In complete contrast to the
Berlioz piece was the Mozart “Pi-
ano Concerto No. 27" with Clif-
ford Curzon as piano soloist. Mo-
zart’s outstanding quality, in di-
rect contrast to Berlioz, is his
simplicity. Where Berlioz takes
his expansive “idee ﬁxe” and
continually embellishes it with
cluttered orchestration, Mozart’s

Once again, Parary measured
up to expectation, providing leis-

Curzon, also, was high successful.
His statement of themes was sim-
ple and straightforward, and his
developmental techniques con-
tinued in that vein.

Curzon’s touch at the piano
was especially noticeable, and in
perfect order for Mozart. It was
light, yet ﬁrm, making the whole
piece delicate and effective. This
piece too, was a delight.

The concert closed with Chab-
rier’s “Espana.” This brief varia-
tion on some Spanish themes
was played with a bull ﬁghter’s
temperament, while the whole
orchestra displayed real Latin
spirit. Once again, Paray conduct-
ed the orchestra in a lively man-

Competes With Desire

By BILL CABIN
If desire won wrestling matches, Clair Riley would be
a champion. Riley has been handicapped mainly by size this
year, weighing 157 and wrestling in the 167-pound division.
“But he has made up an awful lot of that disadvantage

with heart,” said coach Rex Peery. “He’s a real scrapper.”

Riley displayed sheer guts while losing a 4-3 overtime
decision to Lehigh captain Harley Ferguson in the quarter-

ﬁnals of the Easterns last Satur-_
day. “The coach told me we need-
ed the win,” said Riley, “and I
was all psyched-up for the
mate .” ,

Although Ferguson had defeat-
ed Riley in a dual-meet, this sea-
son and had a ten-pound weight
advantage, Riley's desire in-
creased. He came out on the mat
with mercury-like speed, immedi-
ately scoring a predicament and
take down on the befuddled Fer-
guson.

“I was up for that match,” said
Riley, “and when he made a mis-
take I got right on him.” Fergu-
son, however, fought back ﬁerce-
ly, tying the match in the second
period. Riley began the third per-
iod with another burst of speed,
and reversed the stmmed Fergu-
son.

Despite Ferguson's superior
strength, Riley rode him with a
tight waist for two-and-one-half
minutes. Lehigh fans were stupe-
tied and yelled in despair as
Ferguson failed to elude Riley.

“His size advantage ﬁnally
overcame me,” said Riley in dis-
gust. Ferguson reversed him at
8:30, sending the match into
overtime. Both Riley and Peery
thought Riley had the necessary
one minute riding time advan-
tage, but he had only 55 seconds.

Ferguson’s strength proved de-
cisive in the overtime as hre'im-
mediately escaped Riley and
Scored a take down. Riley, how-
ever, maintained his desire, des-
pite his fatigue. He scored an es-
cape and a take down in a vali-
ant third period ﬂurry, and Le-
high coach Gerry Leeman jump-
ed up in a state of frenzy.

“My biggest problem has been
holding a bigger guy,” said Riley,
and that was how he lost as Fer-
Sllson scored a last period es-
cape. “I had that tight waste on
him." continued Riley, “but he
just outmuscled me in that last
period.” ‘

The loss typﬁed a‘ frustrating 7

year for a determined wrestler.

...,.

‘CLAIR RILEY
A Scrappy Wrestler

Riley had an unimpressive 1-5-1
record this season, and gave away
at least ten pounds to each op-
ponent. Several times, opponents
merely overpowered him and
drove his face into the mat.

Despite his weight disadvan-
tage and losing record, Riley is a
skilled wrestler. “He has been
about equal with skills to every
one of his opponents,” said Peery.

Riley weighed only 112 pounds
two years ago as a freshman, but
has grown six inches since then.
“The way that boy has been
growing,” said Peery, “he’s liable
to be a heavyweight by next
year.”

Riley, however, plans to move
down. “I wrestled at 137 last
year and began this year at 147,-"
he said. “I’d like to try for a 137
or 147-pound spot next year.”

HALL O’KORN

Dino Boni won the 147-
pound championship as the
wrestling team placed sixth
at the Eastern Intercollegiate
Wrestling Tournament (Easterns)
Saturday at Cornell.‘

Boni, a junior from Burgetts-
town, had a 6-2-1 record this sea-
son and was seeded second. Boni
sprang to action immediately in
his championship match with
Army's Mark Scureman, getting
a take down at 1:20. He rode
Scureman continually until Scure-
man countered with .a take down
in the third period.

Scureman, however, could not
contain the aggressive Boni, who
quickly escaped and scored an-
other take down. “We were both
tiring towards the end,” said
Boni, “But he didn’t have any
drive in the third period.

Despite ‘Boni’s win, the team
only scored 38 points and did not
do as well as coach Rex Peery
had anticipated.

Defending 130-pound cham-
pion Mike Johnson fell victim to a
well - conditioned Bob Steenlage
of Army. Steenlage defeated sec-
one-seeded Joe Peritore of Lehigh
in the semi-ﬁnals, and« edged
Johnson 5-4 in the ﬁnals.

I love

a man in Van Heusen “4«l7”

It's wild, the way his long, lean
good looks come on strong in that
“V-Tapered” ﬁt. Anyone can tell

he's top man on my scene when he
steps out in the stepped-up styling of
authentic Button-Downs or smooth
Snap-Tabs. And the added

attraction of Van Heusen spring
fabrics and colors make him my
favorite distraction.

Baseball Team Schedules
24 Games This Season

Budget cutting by the Univer-
sity will not affect the baseball
team's schedule, according to
coach Bob Lewis. “We will play
24 games, which is just about
the maximum number we can
play,” said Lewis. “Our season
opens April 19 and closes at the
end of May. Most of the other
schools have about the same
amount of time for baseball.”

The Panthers play their home
games at Forbes Field, but when
they conﬁict with the Pittsburgh
Pirates the games are held at
Leech Farm Field. “We don’t
look at the Pirates’ schedule be-
fore we make up ours,” said Lew-
is. “Other teams give us their
open dates and we try to match
them. We also try to arrange
doubleheaders for weekends."
