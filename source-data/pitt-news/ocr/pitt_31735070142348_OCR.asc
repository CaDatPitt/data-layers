Eric Shannon
For The Pitt News

With unemployment conﬁnuingto rise,
Pitt professors and career placement
experts are suggesting that students
re—evaluate the way they approach the
job hunt. ’

Many students, especially seniors,
face the prospect of trying to gain a
foothold in the worst job market since
the Great Depression. Unemployment
roseto 10.2 percentlastmonth, butfor

people ages 20to24, the outlookis even
worse—~ at15to 16 percentunemploy-
ment, professorjames Craft said.

He noted that the unemployment
rate is much better for people with
bachelor’s degrees, about 4.7 percent.
Butthat numberis misleadingbecause
it does not take age into account. “For
people that areyounger, thatnumberis
going to be much higher,” he said.

Siddharth Bansal, who graduated
with a degree in English literature in
2008, has been searching for a job for

a-

about a month now.

“I’m having a lot of trouble,” said
Bansal, who recently ﬁnished a year-
long service project in India.

Craft saidit’s goingto be achallenge
to ﬁnd a job someone wants and that
students might have better success if
they take unconventional approaches
to the job hunt.

They should start by seeking part— '

time employment, he said.
“Inthis holiday season alot of retail
stores hire part—time workers,” he said.‘

Established 1910 ‘

BIDS

‘A large percentage get hired ﬁill—time
afterward.” V

A second route is to sign up with a
temp agency, because the temp mar-
ket is rebounding as employers look
for work without having to make an
immediate commitment. “Temps are
often on the job, and if they do a good
job when the employer wants to hire,
they look at the temps ﬁrst,” he said.

He suggested that students avoid
looking for part-time or temporary
work in the manufacturing and con-

A

 

struction sectors. ' V

“’I‘hey’ve been hit hard by the cri-
sis,” he said. “The bestareasfor growth
occur in the service industry.”

It’s a notion that optimistic junior
Angela Gorno has caught onto.

“I recognizethefactthatlcanmake
moneyas abartender orwaiu'ess while
Iwait for the right jo ,” she said.

A third option is to get an intern-
ship, the traditional college staple for
entering the work force.

Inspired in part by the tiny ridges that natu-
rally occur on water—resistant lotus leaves, Gao’s
silicone—resin solution prevents this contact on
anano—metric level. ‘

Gao’s solution is spray—on, and the silicone
particles, or silica, form the solid that the spray
becomes. These nanoparticles are anywhere
from 10 nanometers to 1 micrometer in size.
VVlth the help of the rubber—like resin, they clump
together and resist the water.

“You can imagine [the rain] suspended on
these hills and valleys,” Gao said. “Only the top
of the hill is in contact with water. The rest of the
water is actually in contact with air.”_

When Gao and Cao spray_the solution on a
surface, water can touch only about 10 percent
of it. A video at www.pitt.edu/news20o9/ice.
html shows super-cooled water forming ice on
two aluminum plates, one of which is covered
in the solution. Ice piles up on the plate without
the solution, and it can’tbe shaken off afterward.

Water mostly slides right off the plate with the
solution, and the little ice that does form is easily
shaken off.

Gao and Cao still need to tweak their solution
abit before people canbegin using it.

Cao said researchers need to improve the

solution’s“robustness.”Thoughhardtofeelfrom ‘

stepping on or touching it, you could take aknife
to the stuff and scrape it off, a state for which

would certainly be glad to have them,” he said.
“Students then have the chance to show the stuff

However, gettingan internship is often easier

Some, such asjunior Lindsey Davish, might
even feelthat abachelor’s degree is no longer suf-
ﬁcient. “The bachelor’s is the high school degree
of the 21st Century,” she said. “I feel like I need to
go to grad school to bulk up my resume.”

For now it’s cnucialthatstiidents do whatthey

“With fewer jobs available, employers’ stan-
dards can be raised,”Jackson said. “The more
internship experience, more volunteer work,
better grades, etc., results in better chances of
ﬁnding employment.” ’

’ He also emphasizedthe importance of ﬂex-
ibility and persistence, adding that “work ﬂex-

chances of obtaining employment. ”

ong gone are the days when
Lsmartphone applications

consisted of conventional,
simple additions to the _everyday
cellphone user, such as weather
reports or maps. Today, the apps
keep getting more complex and
downright quirky — and it looks
like they’ll keep getting zanier as
we continue to merge our social
lives with technological develop-
ments.

PeopleFinders, an online in-
formation broker, has some new
apps that could pry a little deeper
into the dating realm. Here’s a
hypothetical scenario: It’s a Fri-
day night, you’re at the bar and
your decision—making abilities are
slippery at best. Not sure if you
really want to head back with that .
guy who’s had his arm around you
the last couple of hours? No wor-

ries. Whip out your iphone and i

use the “Look up before you hook
up” app for a quick criminal back-
ground check of your potential
newfriend. But maybe Mr. Right
For The Night shouldn’t really be
out at this hour. Use the “Are They
Really Single?” app, which scans
marriage and divorce records to
make sure he didn’t subtly slip his
ring in his pocket before offering
to buy you that drink. — .

But wait, there’s more. “The
Stud or Dud?” app digs up as much
information as possible on what-
ever name you type in. The results
could be past addresses, business
and professional licenses to bank-
ruptcies, ‘eviction histories and
real estate ownership, according
to CNN.

The app draws its info from
public records available to anyone.
It’s supposedly such a‘ deft tool,
however, because PeopleFind-
ers has been collecting datafor
more than 20 years from sources
all across the United States and

_ stockpiling it in..one database.

Sorry high schoolers, the app
only accesses data from those 18
and older. ‘ V _ 1

Short of hiring a private inves-
tigator, these apps take snoop-
ing to a new high -— forget the’ V
limitations of Facebook stalking.
Then again, this app could pro-
vide a sobering wake—up telling
you whom not to wake up next
to. Or it could just prevent gold
diggers from accidentally aiming
too low. Either way, it’s sure to
prevent some unwanted frolick-
ing and awkward moments and
explanations.

Assuming the skilled Google
searcher or person willing to track
down a few ﬁles could ﬁnd all this
information the old—fashioned
way, privacy concerns are less
of an issue. Some users have ex-
pressed concerns, however, that
the information isn’t sureﬁre ac-
curate.‘ In some instances, this
means a dating blunder, but what
about the employer using these
apps to prescreen potential em-
ployees? We’re toying with our
trust in technology. '

And just how far are we tak-
ing these apps? As shown, they’re
even a cause of some controversy.
Then again, there’s a range of
simplistic, just-for-fun apps -’— a
sign of our proclivity to ﬁnd new
methods of amusement. From iF-
art to iBeer, we’ve shown we can
get creative while humoring our
less—than-intellectual sides -— but
we’ve already proven that. Turn
on MTV if you don’t believe us.

All these more inventive and
in—depth apps like these released
by PeopleFinder reﬂect our age-
old outlook on technology: If we
can, we will. From Facebook to
texting, our social lives intertwine
ever morewith technology. And
things aren’t slowing down.

So what’s next? There’s no app

for that. Not yet. -

LocalPittsburghsongwriters collaborateon rp

Stajf Writer

You don’t need to be signed to a major

record label to release an album — at
least notinPittsburgh. ~

The Pittsburgh Songwriters Circle
has released ﬁve albums, all of them
featuring an ensemble of local mu-
sicians and songwriters — none of
whom consider making music their
careers.

» “I love writing songs just for the
sake of writing songs, and the people
who come to the Songwriters Circle
are the only people I-know who un-
derstand that,” songwriter Bruce
Hoffman said. .

The Pittsburgh Songwriters Circle
is alocal folk—singing group that meets
at least once a month to share its ap-
preciation of music and assist others
in songwriting.

The meetings allow a chance for
feedback and critique_of personal
pieces in a comfortable environ-
ment.

The group is free to join. It’s easy
to get in,~and yet even its members ad-

. rnitittook awhileto growcompletely

comfortable in the group.

“What takes some work isfor each
of the members to decide that they ﬁ-
nally wantto sh.owup and participa ,”
songwriter Peter Donovan said. “I am
not unusual in the fact that I thought
about going for years before I ﬁnally
put my guitar in the car and drove to
the Bloomﬁeld Bridge Tavern.”

Hoffman also spent a period of
time ﬁnding the courage to walk

through the door as a newcomer.

' “OnceIdid, I realizedthiswasthe
place for me, and I have beenaregular
ever since,” Hoffman said. “I discov-
ered that there were all these other
people who shared my interests. That
was arevelation for me.” 

The shared interest allows for
feedback on songs that otherwise
might not be available, so composi-
tion is always encouraged. '

“Songwritinginavacuumis limit-
ing,” Donovan said. “Sure, you can
steal ideas from recordings, but it is
so much more fun to steal ideas from
talented people in the same room.”

Every month the songwriters pick
out or are given an assignmentto help
narrow the focus of the songtopic and
idea, which also assists inthe compo-
sition process.

“The more you [write], the bet-

ter you get,” Donovan said. “It takes
talent, practice and spark [to create
music .” _

“The assignment that we get each
month pushes me to write, because I
want to come back the next month
with a new song,” songwriter Sue
Gartland said. “There are so many
different styles ofwritingrepresented

said. “Though they may be ﬁctional—
ized or revised or taken way out of
context, personal experiences, both

past and present, pop up in my songs ‘

all the time.”

Donovan and Gartland agreed
that their lives are what inspire their
songs.

“The Songwriters Circle provides

the camaraderie and encouragement
and even the technique,” Donovan
said. “But real life is what provides
the fodder. That’s where the heart-
breaks happen and where the spirit

moves.”

Then comes the meeting and '

critique, and over time, the ﬁnished
work is_ completed and recorded for

CDs such as the newly released Col-
lection 2070.

But organizing and maintaining
the group can be a challenge, too.

“You need to have two or tlireef"

people who are willing to take on the
brunt of it and a few others to pitch
inas needed,” Hoffman said. “We are
lucky to have that. My hope is that
when the time comes for those of us
who take on those responsibilities to
move on, therewillbe others ready to
step up and take over.”

’ Despite the challenge of schedul-
ing meetings, keeping members in-
formed, recording and even advertis-
ing, the songwriters are happy 
their group. 

“I really appreciate that we have
some members of the group that keep
us all updated through e-mail, by re-
minding us that the ﬁrst Tuesday of
the month is coming up, reminding
us what the assignment is and main-

Gartland said. “Our annual CD compi-

to. [We work] on the project, and then
when it’s done, [we get] together for

We have a great time supporting each
other.”

Video games gain   influence in

A couple weeks ago, the video game
“Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2” ar-
rived at my suite, and the television
hasn’tbeen turned off since. The same
istrue, I’rn sure, for millions offormally

stable households across the country .

And Hollywood noticed.

Kevin McKidd, the star of the HBO
show“Rome,” said discussions areun-

more excitement, but it came duringa
time of video game mania, including

if word that Brad Pitt might be produc-

“DarkVoid,” and “'Iwilight’-’ producer

those of comics or books. But there’s a

Wanamaker emerges as leader in recent play"

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Lastseason, Whenthe shot clockwound
down orthe otherteammadearun, the
Pitt men’s basketball team turned to
Levance Fields to "drain a last-second
3—pointer, Sam Young to throw down
a thunderous  or Dejuan Blair to
grab a crucial offensive rebound.
Perhaps one ofthe mostimpottant
elements the Panthers  season
is players  and able to take con-
trol when the team needs them. 
» Against Youngstown State, Brad

, Wanamaker and Ashton Gibbs did

exactly that.

Whenthe Panthers found theirlead
dwindlingagainstthe Penguins on Sat-
urday, Wanamaker and Gibbs put the
young Pitt squad back on track.

On a team laden with ﬁ'eshmen
and currently missing all ﬁve starters
fromlastseason, thafs exactlywhatPi_t;t
neededﬁom its two most experienced
guards.

Following a timeout after the Pen-
guinshitconsecutive shotstotrim.Pitt’s
halﬂime leadto one, Wanamakerscored
on a layup and drained a 3-pointer to
boost the deﬁcit back to six.

. Wanamaker was one point away

fromtyinghis careerhighonsatnrday.

He ﬁnished with 14 points on 4—of-7
shooting, includingz for4frombeyond
the arc. He was also perfect from the
foul line.

Head coachjamie Dixon said Wa-
namaker played his best game of the
year, although itwasn’thisscoringthat
impressed Dixon the most.

“It’s good to see the rebounding

from Brad,” Dixon said. “Thafs some- .
thing we’ve talked about. I think he *

shoultlbe a very good rebounderfor
us, and hehas improvedasthe season’s
gone on.”  '

Wanamaker ﬁnished  H
rebounds, including two offensive, in

his best performance on the boards
all seas on.

Wanamaker was the most impres-
sive player on the ﬂoor inthe ﬁrst half;
asPittstruggledtoﬁndits syncandwas
keyto Pitttakingaleadintheﬁrsthalf
afteriallingbehind 10-5 withintheﬁrst
few minutes. '

Hehadahandinnine ofthe Pan-
thersﬁrst18 points, hittinga3—pointer
and two foul shots and assisting on a

'I‘ravon Woodall jumper and a Nasir ,

Robinson layup.
As aleader, Wanamakeralsounder-’
stands what theteam needs to focus

_ on improving in order to ﬁnd success

this season.
After the Youngstown State game,

Wanamaker emphasized the impor-
tanceof Pitt basketball’s traditional
strength: defense. ~

“I don’tthinkwetakealotofpridein

I the waywe play defense,” Wanamaker

said. “Oncewe dothat, Ithinkitwillbe
easierforus to win games.” ,
Wanamaker also led the Panthers
in their previous game, a loss to Texas
inwhich he scored 13 points. -
While  aker shone in the
ﬁrst halfagainst the Penguins, Gibbs
struggled. He scored only two points,
and both came from the foul line.
However, much like Fields could be

: counted on to hit critical shots, even _
when he experienced an oﬂF'—shooting '
night, Gibbs found his thythmwhen the

Panthers needed him the most. '
With 12 minutes remaining the
game," Pitt found itself tied at 42 with
the Penguins when Gibbs scored eight
points duringa 10-0 Panther run that
opened the margin for the ﬁnal time.
Although Gibbs ﬁnished 4 for 13
from three and 2 for 7 from the ﬁeld,

his 12 second-halfpoints came when ‘

the teamwas struggling. .
“I was able to make some adjust-

ments andtakewhattheirdefense gave
me, and from there I knocked down a
fewopenlooks,” Gibbs said. “Whenever

I’m open, I’m goingto do my best to i

make the shot.”

Bob Sheppard gone but not forgotten

4 ‘fNow batiing for the Yankees  No. 2

 Derek ...Jeter  No. 2.”

Before journalism removed all of -

my bias and purged my allegiances,
I rooted for the Red Sox on occasion.
This Iwill admit. " A
Butevenlwillmissthevoice of-Bob
Sheppard, the longtime Yankees pub-
lic address announcer, who stated on
Thursday that hewill not return to his
post with the New York ball club.
Sheppard, who turned 99 last
month, logged 56 years in the booth
for the Yankees before a bronchial

_ infection sidelined him during the
2007 ALDS. He hasn’t armounced in- _ .
stadium since, though a recording of .

his voice still plays for DerekJeter’s
at-bats.

_ Hereﬁised to call his armounce-
ment on Thursday an official retire-

ment, but he told Newsday, “I don’t ,

thinkaman, 99 years old, goes backto
work after two years of separation.”
It doesn’t matter if you hate the
Yankees. It doesn’t matter if you still
thinkMarkTeixeira shouldhave signed
witl1 yourteam instead ofNewYork. It
doesn’t matter ifyou can’t 'standJet:er’s
little jump-throvtn Sheppard’s voicewas

, a part of baseball for six decades.

Forget about me. Even my ‘dad
doesn’t remember a Yankee game
without Sheppard’s trademark style.
I.ikethe InﬁeldFlyRule orjulio Franco,

you don’t ask when exactly Sheppard V

becameapartofthe game. Hewas just
always there. ‘

He’s older-than the old Yankee
Stadium. His debut in the booth co-
incided with Mickey Mantle’s ﬁrst
game at home.

Lou Gehrig’s 2,130 consecutive
games-played streak has nothing on
Sheppard. In addition to his 4,500
games with the Yankees, he did the
public’ address armouncing for the
New York Giants for 50 years.

. Nowthathessteppingdown, I just
can’thelp butfeel like the Yankees-Red
Soxrivalry—.andbaseballasawhole
- won’t be the same. ,

Reggie Jackson called him “the -

Voice of God.” Mickey Mantle said he

felt shivers up his spine every time he ’

announcedhis name. -

_ Probably every kid —- whether?

they know the man’s name or not —
envisions Sheppard’s voice in his head‘

when he imagines stepping up to bat
with the bases loaded, bottom of the
ninth, down by three. You know the

There’s nobody like Sheppard,
and between his unofﬁcial ofﬁcial
retirement and the demolition of the

‘ original Yankee Stadimn, it’s the end

of an era. .

Sheppard maybethelastlinktothe
most memorable moments inYankee
history, both joyous and melancholic.
He sat in the booth for Roger Maris’
61st home rim — which I like to pre-
tend is still the record‘ —— and read a
poem the next game to commemorate
the event. He also wrote and read a
poem afterThurman Munson passed
away in a plane crash in 1979.

’ Sheppard fought in the Paciﬁc
theater in World War II, played quar-

-5-!
terback in college for St. _]ohn’s and
earned a master’s degree from Colum-
bia in 1933.

Ifyou didn’tknow about Sheppard,
now you do. He’s been the one ﬁxture

intheYankeesfranchise.And nowhe’s{‘ .,

leaving.

To sound like a cantankerous
purist, almost every team these days
blasts Timbaland or Chacarron Mac-
arron for walk-up music. Public ad-
dress armouncers will shout at fans
to“getpumped, Pirates fans”for Ryan’ ‘
Doumit’s two-out at—bat. Don’t forget
to get onyourfeetforthe sixth-inning
hot dog-ﬂinging, T-shirt-slinging
