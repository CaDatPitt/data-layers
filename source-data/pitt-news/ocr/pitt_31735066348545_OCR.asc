The Engineering Student Cabinet
(ESC). received $1300 funding for
its Shamrock Ball despite an Allo-
cations Committee guideline that
forbids funding of formal dances, it
was revealed at last weelc"s Student
Government Board (SGB) meeting.

The story broke when the Alloca-
tions Committee was questioned by
ROTC representatives. on its ra-
tionale for providing the ESC with
funds after it had deniedtmoney for
the ROTC Military Ball and the
Greek Week.Formal.

Admitting last year’s Board had
erred in funding the Shamrock
Ball, the SBG explained that “bud-
get .modifications” requiring the

" approval of only a single Alloca-

  

-tions Committee member had’ en-
abled the ESC to manipulate
piecemeal funding of its affair.‘ The
SGB stressed,‘ however, that “one
wrong does not justify another,” in
its refusal to reverse funding
decisions on the Greek and ROTC

Officially .listed as the Shamrock
Presentation, the ESC formal was
given a total of $1300 by last year’s
Allocations Committee, with ‘only
$450 for entertainment.

Through a budget modification’
this year, .however, the ESC took
funds from other activities in its
yearly budget and added them to
the original entertainment. allot-

$500 from its own resources, the
ESC then contracted a rock group
and an orchestra to play for a to
of $1350: . ’
Technically, the affair remained a
‘-‘Presentation,” but other campus
organizations have argued it has
since become a formal dance, thus

‘not eligible for SG funding.

According to ESC President Paul
Walsilko, the ESC’s ‘actions were
entirely legal. “Everything we did
was above board,” Walsilko said.

or a ball, we did nothing wrong.
“I can’t see_ -why we’re being

,accused of illegal action when

we’re funding much of the program
with our, own inoney and just
shifting our resources to pay for the
rest of it. I’d recommend our
organized methods to the Greeks
and ROTC for getting their pro-
grams funded.”

Shapp's Budget: A Hint  

BY BILL MOORE

Governor Milton Shapp will pre-
sent his budget proposal to ,the
state legis1ature.Tuesday offering a
strong hint a Pitt’s eventual ﬁscal
situation.

Shapp’s budget allotment to Pitt
will be subject to change by the
legislators, but Harrisburg-watch
ers expect much of the govemor’s
proposal to pass unchanged. .

The amount of state money given
Pitt will determine the extent to
which tuition will
increased and programs out back.

The budget package will be
presented in a televised address at
2 pm. It is then up to the

legislators to adopt a ﬁnal spending-

plan for the fiscal period beginning
July 1.
A spokesman from the govemor’s

budget office, Ray Staffeldt, said,
earlier Pitt will not receive the r
._ roughly $62 million requested, but

will be allotted some increase over
lastyear. . v _

It is the policy of the budget office
to remain silent on exact figures

” BY BILL MOORE

The Ofﬁce of Student Affairs is
presently gathering facts as it
approaches a ﬁnal decision on the
probable elimination of the Pre-
Professional Advising Committee
(PPAC). _ .

Student Affairs vice-chancellor
Alfred Moye said he is now
checking, with medical and dental
schools to determine to what extent
the'advising has been worthwhile.
A “We are going to continue advis-
ing, but what form it will take will
have to be decided later,” he said.

Moye is asking professional
schools for data on how many Pitt
students applied, how many were
accepted, and how much effect the

‘work of the'PPAC had on their

applications.

Another area being looked into, V

according to Moye, is where the
responsibility lies for advising stu-
dents. , '

"We aretrying to ﬁnd out how

much advising the committee really

uate schools March 12 and 13.

CASH members Teki Fessehat- -.

zion, Deidre Lejeune, Mohammed
Sidky and Rick Yoder, all from the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA), are
responsible for coordinating this
effort.

“By discussing this with repres- .

entatives of GPSA, we saw it as a
way of getting other graduate
students involved,’-’ Sidky said.

“We have placed the responsibility
on GPSA representatives from all
graduate schools to coordinate and

administer the famine relief effort

in each school,” Yoder said‘.
CASH members emphasized con-

sciousness-raising on the part of

students and faculty as an-impor-

tant part of their efforts. “We have .

two objectives, ” F essehatzion said.

 An unidentified student sifts through her hefty purse to help Hockey

Club member Bob Arturo‘ in the group’s struggle‘ to'[ life themselves
from financial troubles’. Hockeytclub members have been selling tickets

*.Wi,lson.~ ’  ,

did. ~ If we find the advising was

_ done extensively, and by a number

of ‘different people, we will have to
consider that in our decision,”
Moye said.

Moye said he feels advising of the
type done by the PPAC was
important, but added it may be
handled elsewhere.

“A major part of our function as a
university is to give students as
much help as we can as they on to
professions, ‘or professional
school,” he explained, “but the
faculty ought to be more involved,
and not just the few «faculty ‘who
work with the committee.”

Student Affairs will look into the
problem for the next few weeks
beforedeciding the fate of pre-
professional advising, but despite
the eventual decision, present ad-
vising will continue. ‘

“We will follow through on the’
juniors,” Moye promised.
“Nobody is going to be cutoff in
midstream._Tﬂ_   , , ,,.- .

-“One is to raise money. The other
is to raise people’s levels of
consciousness. ”_ . A
Last fall, GSPIA students col-
lected about $750 for drought relief

in Africa. “Ninety percent of the .

money we collected last fall came

. from students,” Fessehatzion said.

‘‘We’d like to raise the'level of

P faculty consciousness about Third

World problems.” .

“If-it were just a collection of‘

money," Yoder said, “you would
pay today and forget about it
tomorrow.” By not eating and by
donating this money,
students can experience in a tan-
gible way what people in Third
World countries live with every
day. _ .

Funds collected will be given to
the American Friends" Service

. Committee and the Mennonite

Central Committee, Yoder said.

_“Through_ research and personal

experience, these two organiza-
tions were found to be reliable.” \
Yoder said some of the money will
be used for food and clothing.

“The rest of it will go into technical -
' assistance’--activities ‘that involve

food production.” ‘
i “The money will not be spent just
for food,” Sidky said, “but to set
up programs so these people can
help themselves. r
“People have the wrong ‘ideas
about hunger," Sidky said. “They
think it’s basically due to lazi-
ness.‘.T lmperialist countries that
destroy agricultural economies,
‘weather extremes and political
control are factors that are respon-
sible for starvation in Third World
nations. he said. /‘ ., “

Food Relief Drive

(Continued from Page 1)
“There have been many criticisms
of food aid and relief,'but it’s not
worth risking even one life over
these arguments,” Sidky said. “I
hope that people are concerned and
that they don’t think it’s a hopeless
case. Right now the situation is at
_ a crisis stage. We want to keep
people alive until basic changes
occur.” ,
“Our efforts are directed primar-
ily at graduate schools,” Yoder

 said. He said the next step would

be a University-wide effort invol-
ving undergraduates and the estab-
ment of a permanent organization
at Pitt to deal with Third World
problems. '

Student leaders, mainly heads of
the three student governments, are

-also formulating a drive to ﬂood the

legislators with student input on
the budget. A

A campaign to contact individual
legislators from the students’ home

districts has been called-for by the’

University board, comprised of the
student leaders. ‘
The next few weeks will be the
crucial period for Pitt in terms of
insuring adequate funds to function

a at top level without any drastic’

tuition hike or program cutback.
Once the Pitt allotment ‘is ﬁnaliz-

‘ed, the University's Budget and

Planning office, along with Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar will consider
the possibilities and decide the
tuition hike some have called “in-
evitable. ’ ’.

it seems the Lord has ﬁnally wised
up. Glaciers are gathering up
North to prepare what may be one
of the most stunning climatic
disasters‘ of the last million years.

Every conceivable fact seems to
point to another impending ice age.
Of course emergency legislation
will be necessary toact definitely
on the problem. If anything is to be
done, Congress had better start
now. _ ~ .
All parliamentary quirks and per-
versions considered, if Congress
starts now, we may have federal
action in time to evacuate Detroit
and upper New York.
‘One of the great questions raised
by sociologists is what Americans
are going to eat." Some have smiled
wickedly and replied “Each
other,” while othersseem to be

Dust Bowl Disaster of the 30’s.
With most of the Great Plains

under a sheet of ice, and with the

rest of the world settling into the

icy grip, it is only logical ands

pragmaticto assume we will have
to turn south for the thousand-year
winter. ‘ ' _

The only problem as sociologists
see it is Mexico, a small country,
similar to parts of New Mexico,
where the population speaks with a
strange Spanish accent.

According to last reports, much of
Mexico is empty, containing only
vast acres of mud huts and Inca
fuins, or was it Aztec?

Obviously, this country is faced

with the problem of obtaining

 

southern space for our teeming
population of accountants and what
nots. The answer is assimilation.

The ﬁrst moves have alreadybeen
made.. MacDonalds has recently
begun (under a secret CIA agree-
ment) to buy real estate in the
major cities and framing towns.
What must follow is a major
invasion, possibly with Ford
dealerships and Coca-Cola bottling
plants and of_ course, military‘
personnel. ‘

There may be some resistance,
but repeated waves of Hamilton

Drano and Seagrams Seven adver-
tisements should be able to stifle
such token dissatisfaction. I

It must be said we hope’ the
Mexican people will take this

Continue Protest
To the Editor, I

The Graduate Employees of’ the
Pitt Professional Union (PPU) are

I surprised and angered byvthe Pitt

News policy of accepting misin-
formation supplied by University
administrators instead of doing its
own investigative reporting. Had
the Pitt News checked with the
representatives of student organi-
zations on the present student
Health Care Committee instead of
with an administrator it could have
discovered the following:

[1] This is the first time official
representatives of student organi-
zations have been included on the
Student Health ’Care Committee.
And they would not be there now
had it_ not been for some loud
protesting about the way decisions
on health care insurance were
made.in the past.

(2) Graduate employees were not
informed of changes _in health
insurance coverage, at renewal
time. The first official _notice of

‘changes was issued in mid-Novem-

ber, and only after considerable
protest from graduate employees
who___learnede about the c_hanges_.

‘when Blue.Cross/Blue Shield

"prepared the bills.’ ,

(3) At least two members of the
present Student Health Care
Committee are also members of the '
Board of Directors’ of ' Blue
Cross/Blue Shield.’ I

[4] The University has no written

contract with Blue Cross/Blue
Shield, _nierely._ . a-_ ‘,‘g_er_itl_eman’s‘ ,

‘5'3*¢5¢!‘?'e"‘-"-’ 

(5) The present committee is.

under great pressures of time to _
get some health insurance cover-_

age for students. It has not really
had time to investigate the best

possible ‘coverage because it’ was I
' constituted too late.

, (6) The University administration-

will- have the ﬁnal say on whether -

its graduate employees will be

covered by whatever policy this 

Student Health Care Committee
recommends.

The Graduate Employees in the
PPU have maintained contact with
student representatives on the

Student Health .Care Committee ,
and we applaud their efforts to ,

improve- student health insurance
coverage. However, we believe

that as employees of the University _
of Pittsburgh we are entitled to

bargain with University manage-
ment [administration] on _the
question of health insurance and to

, determine collectively whether we

accept the student health insurance
plan or some other coverage as a
fringe benefit. -

Once the smoke screen of unfair
labor practices is cleared away, it is
possible to see that the University
management has. no intention of
bargaining with graduate employ-
ees as employees, no matter what
group would seek to represent
them in that capacity. The
University is insisting at the Labor
Board hearings that graduate
employees are not employees.
Unless the University changes its
attitude, Labor Board hearings and
court cases could continue for
years on this issue.

In the meantime, graduate em-
ployees will continue to protest and
agitate in whatever manner seems
best suited to accomplishing their
goals, and to build a graduate
employees union which he U-
niversity cannot refuse to recog-
nize.

Where will the Pitt News be on-

this issue, with the employees or
with management? _

recommends lots of fiction. When

his writing comes in part from the
impressionistic way in which he
sees reality. He has an acutely
developed feeling for mood, and he
chooses his details in an- artful,

the atmosphere of half-light in
which his characters live."

His most recent work is The Last

stories. He has contributed to
Story,. Nation, Life, "Saturday

publications.

At. 65, Algren’s compulsion to ,:

write remains with him, but he’s
leaving his Chicago homestead for
Paterson, NJ -- a move perplexing
many. He is out of touch with
Chicago, but “I haven’t changed --
Chicago has.” ‘*
Frankness is an Algren quality,
perhaps the result of his tendency

to rely more on the stomach than on

the intellect -- especially when
writing. “I always think of writing
as a physical thing,” he said

Freelancing is the art of writing a
magazine article about a subject
you're interested in, and/ or know a
little bit about, getting paid very
little for it, and still managing to
eat. '
Freelancing is not what you would
call easy, but as a way of life it has
certain definite advantages.

Writing for the whole range of
women's magazines—Ladies
Home Journal and Redbook to
movie fan magazines to fashion
magazines to MS, Cosmo and
Viva—has all the difficulties and

writer, with very deﬁnite ideas on what. the business is all about.
“A writer shouldikeep it pent up inside until he can work it out on his
typewriter. Don’t tell anyone what you’re doing‘, don’t talk about what
you’re writing until you can get to that typewriter.” '
People, particularly student writers at Pitt, don’t write enough,
according to Gutkind. Figuring 24 hours in a day, you should figure six
of them to sleep and_at least six of them to write. -He rises at 6 am seven
days a week and writes until noon, and longer if he’s going good. While
he was working on Bike Fever, he was getting up as early as four. in the

morning to write.

He's an associate professor in the afternoons, the only full-time
nonfiction instructor at Pitt. His schedule is out of kilter now that he's
between projects, waiting for the April 29 publication of his latest book,
The Best Seat in Baseball, But You Have to Stand. For that book, he
followed one group of four major league umpires through the 1974

baseball season.

 And who EverSoid  
  Freelancing Was Easy?

advantages of typical freelancing,
plus a few of its own.

“A freelancer tries to make a
living without a nine-to-ﬁve job,"
says Carol Ardman, who’s been in
the freelancing business full-time
only a little more than a year.
“Most freelancers I know KNOW
how to live on very little.”

The first step in any freelancing is

"5

reading the magazines to become
familiar with their market and what
Ardman calls their “personality.”

Next—and a good bit more diffi-~

cult—is brainstorming an idea for
that magazine.
Human interest articles and “how

‘ to” stories—How ILost 15 Pounds

on the Stillman‘ Diet—interviews
with famous people, and articles on

handicrafts are big sellers in the ,

women's magazine market today,
Ardman says.

She recommends finding a ﬁeld of
expertise—anything from her own

ﬁeld of Morrocco and Moroccan,

women to politics to crafts to
lesbianism—that you can then
translate into a magazine article.

Ideas come from anyplace—and
anywhere. It’s the job of the
freelancer to give that idea a
hook—to condense the idea of
lesbianism to.‘ ‘lesbian bars’ or to
‘lesbian. marriages’—in order to
make it manageable, and then to
write it to fit the audience.

“Writing on spec”—that is, writ-
ing ..the whole thing and then
sending it around in an attempt to
sell it—-is, according to Ardman,
entirely too risky.

“Time is money to a freelancer,”
Ardman said, “The faster you can
go the better.” Writing on spec
eats up that time, so a query letter
describing the subject and tailor-
made to fit a specific magazine
audience prevents a lot of wasted
effort. In the event_ that a
contracted article doesn’t pan ’out,
or is scratched at the last moment
by an editor, the magazine. is
obliged to pay a “kill fee” to the
author anyway—generally- one
quarter of the article fee.

Freelancers makenotoriously low
pay, ranging anywhere from $200
for a story in MS to a ceiling near
$1500. If it takes ten hours to write
a $250, 1200-word story, an author
But it
rarely does——and ten hours does
not include interview and research
time. ,

Freelance writing is no mean
trick. and it takes a special breed of
writer to make a go at it. “You
need a tremendous amount of
initiative to come up with the ideas
and you've got to be pretty
thick-skinned—you’ll keep getting
rejected," Ardman said. “Add to
that persistent. And aggressive."
\ Still. if you can deal with little pay
and lost of freedom, Ardman

Press? The answer’s obvious.

“I sometimes think I lead a double
life,” he says about his role as a
journalist. “On one hand, I enjoy
writing for The Times partly be-
cause of the immense audience.
On the other h_and, by personality,
I'm sort of an insurgent and a
cirtic. I’m not really much of an
insider.”

Lukas’ schizophrenic behavior
never caused an angry flareup at
The Times, whereupon he threw a
typewriter at an editor, turned over
newsroom desks, stomped his feet:
a lot and quit over a disagreement.
But it did provide the impetus for
his gradual transformation from
news reporter to journalism critic to
magazine writer to book author.

» But while Lukas was reporting the
Chicago conspiracy trial for The
Times in 1969, he and his editors
sharply disagreed on the news-
paper’s coverage of the story. ‘‘I
began thinking,” Lukas remem-
bers,.“that there was no way to
appeal their decision. But certainly
editors should be accountable to
someone.”

So over lunch a year later with

friend Dick Pollack, the former

Press section editor at Newsweek, I

the pair decided to establish
(MORE), ajournalism review right
in New York to keep a watchful eye
on The Times. Pollack now
manages the periodical, which
quadrupled its circulation last year,
while Lukas remainsa semi-active
Senior Editor. -

It wasn't only his outsider’s
attitude that caused him to leave
The Times, because he actually
wrote for it while editing (MORE)
for nearly one year. But Lukas
fears the pitfalls of American
journalism, and thinks it healthy to
escape daily newspapering at an
early age, like 38.

“I think generally speaking that
young journalists are very good
people,” says Lukas, who will
speak to budding writers this
weekend. “They are skeptical,
creative, inquistive, and determin-
ed not to lead humdrum lives.

‘,‘But American journalism is so
rooted in the routine way of doing
things, as shown in wire service
journalism, that it fails to use one
fraction of America’s journalistic
talent. We killed off in every year
"of the journalist’s life.

I Monday,  1:0,; HE

The Thinking Man's Journalist  

“Then at age 40 or 50 journalists

are tired, apathetic, and disinter- _
ested people who go through the

formulas and rap out mediocre
stuff. When your ideal is UPI
beating AP with a story by four
minutes, when the emphasis is on
speed and energy instead of wis-
dom, analytical skills and percep-
tion, then you kill it off." I

Although he admits it’s an arro-
gant view, Lukas says anyone over
40 still in newspapers hasn’t grown
up yet. “After 20 years working in
daily journalism, you really exhaust
all the possibilities,” Lukas says,
“So to grow both as a person, and
as a journalist and writer, I think
you just have to get out."

So after reporting for The Times
for nearly 10 years, then switching
briefly to the Sunday magazine to
get in more serious, analytical
writing, Lukas did get out. And
he’s obviously pleased not to be
trapped in the over-40—»crowd.

After his disagreement with The
Times coverage of the Chicago
conspiracy trial, Lukas wrote his
own book, covering the trial as he
thought it should be covered. Now
he's writing Nightmare: A Narra-

BY RITA VITOLO
You. Clenched in your grubby little fist is the Great American
(choose one: Novel, Short Story, Epic Poem). Nobody but you knows it.
Yet. But who’s going to buy it if They don’t? ’

“I don’t believe agents look for the Great American Novel,” says
 Morris’ literary agent Marcia Higgins, speaking Saturday at
this week’s annual Writer’s Conference. “What is important is will it
sell. Is there a market for it?”

What there is a market for, despite the coming depression, Higgins
predicts, is good fiction -- solid, entertaining fiction with characters
that so grab a reader he has toeturn the pages to know what happens
next and a situation with so much implicit jeopardy he has to hang on
until the end.

What sells is escapist reading: a solid adventure story, a well-plotted
Gothic tale, science-fiction. If you can write another Jaws or The Sting,
you've got a best—seller on your hands.

A nonfiction work that is somehow uplifting or inspirational will sell.
best today, in a market glutted with books on women’s liberation, the
black movement and pop psychology, Higgins said.

By the same token, what doesn’_t sell is an average novel by an.
unknown writer, or a nonfiction book on a trendy subject -- a decision
based on the economics of publishing, wherea book is bought on the
basis of an outline that will take a year to see print -— six months for the
author to ﬁnish it and six months for the publisher to publish it.

An agent’s savviness for a good prospect comes from a knowledge of
the trends in the literary market, particularly a sense of what will be
selling well a year from today, coupled with his own sense of taste. And
that savviness -- provided an author trusts his agent -- can pay off in a
big_way: The four literary agents at William Morris have discovered
four recent New York Times bestseller: James Michener’s Centennial
and Taylor Cladwell’s Glory and the Lightning on the fiction lists;

Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas’ The Memory Book and'Dan Rather and .

Gary Gate’s The Palace Guard.

Getting the most mileage out of products their clients come /out with,
with a certain amount of career development added, is an agent’s job.
That includes getting an author exposure in the magazine market and

what it’s like to be Anne Waldman.

securing movie, TV, stage and foreign publication contracts,
something an author frequently can’t be bothered with.

“Writers like to do writing,” Higgins said.,“An agent takes‘ care of
proofs and hassles with editors, things a writer has neither the time
for, nor reallywants to do. And we’re spending all our time with
buyers.”

An author generally acquires an agent by going to him -- referred

there either through editors or other authors -- with a finished
_manuscript, or a “query letter” describing a project he wants to
investigate. ' * .
An agent can tell from the first paragraph of that letter whether an
author has something going for him -- and he can clearly tell the

difference between student and professional writing.

“Student writing is cathartic,” Higgins said, “writing out of their

own souls. Nobody’s going to put down $10 to buy what’s in theirsouls.

‘ If they're smart, they quickly learn to go to a bookstore and find -out

what people are buying.” —
If you nevertheless are willing to sell your masterwork “over .the
transom” -- that is, sending your manuscript directly to a publishing

house without using an agent, Viking Press acquiring editor Pat Irving .

recommends checking a library's literary marketplace manual -- a
listing of New York publishers and their editors by name -- and

addressingqthernanuscript to a particular editor’s name, notsolely toa .

publisher. - .
Letters addressed simply Viking Press do get read, but it may be

. months before they are opened.~ Include an envelope with return =

postage -- Viking, like some other New York houses, is no longer
accepting unsolicited manuscripts without it.

Depending on what condition a -manuscript is in, an, editor does
some rewriting with the author, based on conferences between the two
concerning the book, although editorial control rarely goes farther than
this. The days when a Maxwell Perkins could shape the work of an
author like Thomas Wolfe are over. ' ‘

Get your name out and get it known .-among the small world of A

publishers and editors, Irving advises young writers, by: selling to
magazines first or establishing some kind of personal contact with an

editor or agent. Although living in New York can aid some writers in _

making these contacts, living close to the publishing action is not really
necessary. _ ,

“A manuscript really worth publishing -- no matter if you have to take
it through 15 houses over the transom -- will still be published if it’s
worth publishing.” '

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Two horrifying Martians slid
towards the ship, tentacles brand-
ishing nuclear blasters, their seven
eyes reflecting destructive inten-
tions.

“Liftoff! We’re under attack!”

,/G-girnapnder Jenkins shouted.

With’a scream of disintegrating
atoms, the space ship snapped into
warp drive, but not before the
Commander squeezed off two lasar
bursts, burning the attacking
creatures into silicon gas.

Suddenly Sparks, the lanky radar
operator, jerked up from his

visi-screen. “Meteorites, Com- ‘

mander...headed straight for us!”
he shrilled.

Dimitri V. Gat, who will conduct a
clinic on science-ﬁction writing in
Saturday’s Writer’s Conference,
thinks what you just read is the
common conception of sci-fi writing
in America today. He thinks this is
..:'-r0i’lg- '

According to Gat, the New Wave"

of sci-fi writers has totally
revolutionized the field in terms of
the creative and artistic products
now sold on the market. Space
opera is now an interesting
artifact, a great theme for satire.

“lt (sci-ti) now reaches a wider
audience so the writer can attempt
new things; in the old days the
readership was really small. But as
technology speeded up, people
wanted to read something that
reﬂected the change.

“People want a story, and you
have to remember that a good
_ is a good story-teller.
ﬁiénce fiction tends to get away
from an obsession with internal
things [in characters].”

“There is a school of thought that
the better sci-ﬁ is bought by people
with a college education or people
who have some kind of science
background. These people want

something with more meat than

ﬁﬁéghter adventure stuff.”

Gat went into science-ﬁction while
attempting to sell mainstream
ﬁction works. His first published
piece was a story set in the future,
which he considered mainstream
ﬁction.

The publisher wrote back, con-
gratulating him 'onswhat a ﬁne
piece of science fiction he turned
out.

“I used to read science ﬁction

 was a kid,” Gat said, “but

then I left it alone for about 10
years. Now that I’m back into it I’m
pretty happy.” ’

Gat said he considers himself a
normal man, sci-fi interests aside,
and his ideas came from a simple
consideration of the present.

“I would say from extrapolation,”

the said, “taking something like

eugenics and the stuff they’re
doing with genes and thinking
about what they might do with it.
For instance, what if some guy got
into the business of making people
to order?”

fence for anyone. “Freelancing is
freedom—all kinds of freedom.
The freedom to do what you want,
to meet interesting people. It's
very isolated work, but any kind of
writer deals with that eventually.

-‘:_ irat moment is inevitable when

you sit down with your typewriter
and have to write."

Get an agent and start writing
queries, Ardman adv-ises. The
freelance field is wide open for
anybody with good ideas.

 

There is also a wide area of
traditional topics, the science-ﬁc-
tion themes from which Gat draws
his ideas. For instance Time
Travel, Exploration of Other Plan-
ets, Life on Other Worlds and the
Future Society.

Then came the New Wave.
Basically a core of madmen who

. W
took science fiction out of it’s
narrow scope and exploded‘ the
traditions. The concussion waves
are still wreaking havoc—science-
ﬁction has splintered into various
factions, to the alarm of members
of the Old Guard.

“The New’ Wave,” Gat said,
“started writing. Ellison and
Delaney and others started doing
new things, and the thing
fragmented. Then membersof the
Old Guard, like Heinlein who
basically wrote space opera, got
more sophisticated.”

But all for the good, Gat assured.
“I think science ﬁction has

beneﬁted from opening up, it used
to be strictly pro-science and now
people are writing that say ‘hey, I
don't even LIKE science."’
Science fiction has been coming
for a long time. Gat said some
consider the first science-ﬁction
tale to have been written by Plato
in his story of people chained to the

V 11511‘ ’

wall of a cave, seeing the shadows
of physical objects as reality.

“A book like Frankenstein still
reads well,“ Gat said. “It's
science-ﬁction in terms of dealing
with man and science.”

The field of science-ﬁction is not
just a literary flash in the pan, the
author said.

“I would say there is,” Gat
commented. “I cannot speculate
about how long it‘ will‘ enjoy this
present boom, but it’s been around
for a long time, it’s not going to die
out tomorrow.”

Drawbacks do exist however, and
Gat sees the largest as a lack of

Dimitri Gat: Sci-fi, Tomorrow & Other Visions

character depth in sci-fi tales.

“I’m really hung up on charac-
ters. Some people feel science
should be the central character,
some are doing great things with
characters. ”

Science-fiction started in the
’30’s, Gat said, and was written
mostly by a small circle of friends.

  
    

    

The new form found publication in
pulps like Amazing and Astound-
ing Tales, and sales of these
magazines prompted hard-back in-
vestment from publishers.

It was the paperback explosion
that gave sci-fi its first mass media
boost, however, said Gat.

“When the paperbacks got big,
they started printing original

anthologies and novels, both
fantasy and’ science ﬁction, and
they found they‘ could sell them.”

Gat said the action in publishing
still remains with original antholo-
gies, and that old-style pulp
magazines have become less
important in the field.

There is a cross-fertilization
between mainstream fiction and
sci-fi these days, although main-
stream authors should be wary of
tampering with the Unknown, Gat
warned.

“For instance, Gravity’s Rainbow
(by Thomas Pynchon, which won
the National Book Award, was also
up for nomination for the Hugo and
Nebulae Awards (sci-fi’s Pulitzer
Prices). When you start borrowing
from science-ﬁction you better be
careful, they might grab you.” ,

Gat commented that the science-
fiction field in comparison to
mainstream fiction is still wide
open to new authors, andihe will
explain how to sell cie-ﬁ ‘on the
open market to people at the
Writer’s Conference.

“I won’t tell anyone to send stuff
to magazines. It’s one of the things
I'm covering in my talk at the
Writer’s Conference,” Gat said.

“You have to think about it. Try to
know how the ﬁeld works, who the
big names are and what’s getting
into print.” _

Gat said the easiest route for
someone after the Big Break in
science fiction is to attend the
conferences’ around the country.

“Some of this stuff is pretty

incestuous, and a lot of theibig

people know each other. You
should get out there and meet the
king-makers.”

"f‘f,Sure there is a lot of competi-

thing about it is the new writer
doesn't really know what the terms
of the competition are.” But
Todd's magazine, The Atlantic, is

always looking for new talent.

“Any subject that comes up. it
takes us a while before we know
who we can assign to which piece.”

But don’t sit around your room
waiting for the Atlantic editor’s to
assign you a major article. You
have to fight.  I

“Everyone wants to write a grand
piece on a large subject, but you‘ll
have a hard time persuading an
editor you can do it."

Start with something you know,
and know well, and ﬁght to get that
story printed. “The best topic is

the place you -live, or some
fragment of experience you can call
your own." ' ‘ ’

Once the article is written, and
written well, you have to find the
right magazine.

 
 

Todd recommends trying those

Sunday supplements most news-
papers carry. Nobody startsiat the
top these days. The more experi-

ence you have, the easier things

become.

If nobody seems interested in your
first attempt, try again with
something different. Try to guess
what magazines might want. “If a
magazine runs a lot of articles on
something, people think they are
interested in that topic and flood
them withsimilar pieces, but by
that time they don’t want any
more. ’

“Find out what a magazine’s
flaws are, what it isn’t covering.”

Magazines usually _, don’t want
someone's ﬁrst article unless it _is

very good, but then they are
extremely interested. “The whole
publishing world is eager to ﬁnd
young people, and they are very
impressed when someone 21 or 22
comes across with a quality piece."
The Atlantic, Todd says, is always
on ‘the lookout for new people with
ideas.

The ﬁght, in other words, never
ends. If you want to write you have

tolearn how, then you have to‘ﬁnd .

something worth writing about,
and then who to write it for, and
then ﬁght to get it published. And
then, it starts all over again.

If you win the little battles, you
can win the war. Winning, to a
writer, is often becoming a staff
writer on a major magazine, or an
editor like Todd.

“Working for a magazine and
writing for one are not the same

lthing. Many magazine editors

don’t write at all anymore.” I
Todd .isn’t certain how one

becomes an editor. “Mine wasn't
the usual route for a job like this --
if there even is one."

One common denominator for
many of Todd’s colleagues is
newspaper experience. “A combi-
nation of things, like newspaper
work', magazine pieces, book 
editing, they might add up to ‘/
magazine editor.”

He recommends editing only to
those with a certain temperament.

. “It is highly distractive. You move

from one topic to another, and
there is no time to get really
involved in anything. It’s abad
place to be if you have ‘a scholarly .
interest.”

The ﬁght is long, certainly not

_ easy, and there are essentially no

hardfast rules of war. Experience,

Todd stresses, is the important

weapon, a weapon which you must“
ﬁght to obtain. . '

In his opening speech Saturday,
however, Lukas will examine the
student journalist. “I think it’s a

"C:_:art\shame to see lusting Wood-

wards and Bernsteins charging into
journalism schools hoping to catch
Tony Ulasewiczs ﬁnding marked
cash in airline lockers,” Lukas
observes. ‘‘I’d like to caution the
youngjournalist about what he can
really expect to find.”
“The great stories of the decade
like Watergate may not be recap-
itulated in the next decade,” Lukas
concludes. “A lot of work needs to
be , done, sure, but it will be
unglamdrous work, like finding out
how the American economy

A man waters his lawn.‘

As with most of the contemporary
poets surrealism surfaces through-
out. A man in his attempts to
deﬁne the world in his images:

Beginning Again

I l’ll go there .-
. I can see myself close to the dead-

like a child with no coat,

like a man without words. .

Then I will respect happiness.

Paul Zimmer is director of Pitt’s
University Press, has taught at Pitt
and Carnegie-Mellon, and is one of
the prominent Pittsburgh poets,
besides being recognized among
the literati:
Fritz Strangles on the World

' The-world is crammed hard-
\lnto my craw and I gag

Upon its continents and seas.
Air, air! My vision doubles,

My tongue strains for openings,
And all my muscles gather.

Air! My teeth foam. Air!

My eyes bulge east and west

But I cannot heave it. out.

God beats upon by back

But the world sticks fast-

And there is no air, no air‘.

Ed Ochester...is a heroic man.
After receiving his MA from Har-
vard andentering the University of

Wisconsin where he had half of his
doctoral thesis completed, he quit
...he out and out stopped working
on it and decided to give himself
some time to think. I know Ed
personally (for better or for worse
for one of us). His poetry has
touched my moods. And for a
grown man to dedicate a book to
the Grateful Dead...well, what can
I say? I think there is one thing, one
particular instance that will make
me remember Ed and it's this: the

day Pigpen died\(if you don’t know

look it up) he came into class and
said. “Doug, Pigpen died,” and I
was afraid he'd'cry in class. That
moment has always stuck in my
mind as has this poem:
"A Line of Patchen’s”

You were asleep

of your hair. _

I love you so much
that war will die.

The mystery of imitating life on
paper via poetry is fascinating and
something more of us ought to be
realizing. These people are beings
first and poets second. Knowing
their work first and their personali-
ties later ‘can be a surprise. Love,

 The Ultirnclie Misfit

friend and traveling companion to
w'riter Simone de Beauvoir -- a
relationship A still publicized." He
appears in her roman a clef, The
Mandarins, about which he now
says: “The ﬁrst time I read it I
didn't recognize who the man
was...l should have been ﬂattered,
but that’s not the way it was.” He
told Newsweek that in her most
recent volume of memoirs Mlle De
Beauvoir is again engaging in
totally humorless yakking and is
“fantasizing a relationship in the
manner of a middle-aged spin-
ster.”

“I have no need of other writers
and they don’t need me. Writers

are not congenial people. They’re -

more competitive than actors and
actresses.” And in America,
writers do not work out of tradition.
“The thing is that here you get to
be a writer differently,” he once
said. “I mean, a writer like Sartre
decides, like any professional man,
when he’s fifteen, sixteen years
old, that instead of being a doctor
he’s_going to be a writer. And he
absorbs the French tradition and
proceeds from there. Well, here
you get to be a writer when there’s
nothing else you can do.”

American writers are misfits in
their society, Algren claims. “Yes,
I'm a misfit -- there's nothing else I
can do.” But what he does -- he
does so well.

BY G. W. STEVENS
Sports Editor

The Pitt basketball team survived

a supreme rip-off Friday night in s

the opening round of the ECAC

, Southern Division tournament,

bouncing back to defeat George

"  “.é.£a\shington in the consolation

game, 89-64, and earning a spot in
next week's NIT tournament.

In the feature game on opening
night, Pitt was manhandled by the
West Virginia Mountaineers, who

. got some valuable ‘assistance from

_ the two ECAC officials, as the Cats

went down to defeat, 75-73.

The Panthers didn’t play well at
all against WVU. As a matter of
fact, they shot just 36 percent from

' the ﬁeld. But the cold. shooting
wasn’t really enough to beat Pitt,
because West Virginia was only

I slightly better -with 44 percent. Pitt

had 87 shots to 59 for WVU, with

___‘ 7;-‘-..n_1ore_ ﬁeld goals (31-26).

‘T The Cats also had more rebounds,
‘sparked by Melvin Bennett’s out-
standing performance. The Pitt

freshman pulled down 21 caroms to.

lead Pitt to a 54-50 advantage.
Pitt‘ also had fewer turnovers,
11-12.

The Panthers lost the game at the
foul line. The Cats were charged

with 25 personal fouls, enabling.

WVU to take 32 shots from the
charity stripe. They were success-
ful on 23 of their attempts, while
the Panthers hit 11_of 17 shots from
the line. _ ' A
Pitt head coach Buzz Ridl, who

/ - usually is very hesitant when it
Q/comes to complainingabout the

ofﬁciating, was unable to keep

 

from criticizing the men in the
striped shirts.

“I was very displeased with the
officiating," _said Ridl, “and I think
I have a right to be. The game
could have been handled better.’-’

Despite the fact the referees
promised both teams prior to the
game they would be free to play
their game without much restric-
tion, the officials immediately did a

turn-agound and called a personal

on any4Pi_tt player who moved. 7
Meanwhile", the Mountaineers
were permitted to play just about

V as they wanted--pushing, hacking,
I and doing anything else they felt

like doing. The two Pitt players
most victimized by 5 the_ referees’
incompetency were Kirk Bruce and
Bennett. Bruce wasn’t able to
move without being called for a foul
and -Bennett wasn’t able to draw
one.

« Bennett came out ﬂying, single- ,
jhandedly controlling the boards

and most of the scoring in‘ the
opening minutes. He ﬁnished with
22 points on seven ﬁeld goals and
eight of 13 foul shots. Problem
was, Bennett took 23 shots, all from
close in--many of them just falling

35-40 points, but he had some

The ECAC succeeded in making a farce out of the Southern Division _-

Whether or notthe rip-off. was deliberate will never be known, but
competent ofﬁcials could not handle the game as the two referees did
/Friday unless they were trying to run Pitt out ofthe tournament. The V.

t_fact still remains that Pitt was obviously the best team in the

tournament, and even the group of writers .traveling with the ‘
Georgetown squad, the eventual winners,‘ were more than willing to
admit that Pitt was the class of the. tournament and that Melvin

Bennett was the best player there.

' Just why the ECAT would want to job Pitt is a serious issue that
deserves looking into. Perhaps the University armounced its plans to
pull out of the valueless association a little too early. And its plans to
' form a new basketball conference that would draw some of the East’s

‘ best teams away from the ECAC, an

it also

It is interesting to note that_ Georgetown was not given the same"
treatment as the Cats’ in the ﬁnal game. Despite the fact that the
ofﬁcials were the same who worked the Pitt game «Friday night, the
game was handled well and the referees actually called‘ the very tight
game very well. How could they do so poorly on one occasion and then
turn around the next night and do a commendable job?
Fortunately, Georgetown’ saved the Southern Division from being
without a suitable representative. West Virginia didn’t deserve to be in
the ECAC tourney let alone the NCAA action. The ECAC had already
blunderedthe invitations and came within one point of blundering the‘

play-off as well.

 _he Cats received at least some retribution yesterday when they were
‘_ ' ""c’hdsen to participate in the NIT, which should be a very exciting

tournament with several top-notch teams. But the fact still remains
that they were ripped-off in Morgantown Friday night by the ECAC. It

 Cats Second InEast Invite _ .

BY_TOM HALL
To say Maryland finished ﬁrst in
the Eastern Intercollegiate Swim-

’ ming and Diving Invitational, or to’

mention Jeff Noury of Syracuse
was the unanimous choice for the
outstanding swimmer, would be to
sell the Easterns short. It would
also cheat the Pitt swimming team
of the merit due-it for an outstand-

. ing performance. A V

- So what can be said in the
Panther’s behalf? Primarily, the
tankers ﬁnished second in the ‘ﬁeld
of 12 teams, 45 points behind
Maryland, but a hundred points
ahead of third place Syracuse.
Pitt’s divers made short work of
both the one and three meter
diving competitions, capturing 108
total team points. Tom Fatyol, a
sophomore from Churchill, was
voted the meet’s outstanding diver

" - on the, strength of his second place’

finish at one-meter, and first place
. ictory in the three-meter competi-
tion. . - »

“The entire diving team was just
excellent,” commented diving

V Coach Al,Coffey. “Everyone gave

it all they had, and I couldn’t be
more pleased. If these kids want to
put the time and work into it that’s
necessary, they could .be great.
They have the potential, but I don’t
think", they realize it.” ‘ ‘
Jeff Miller_ had an: exceptional
meet, winning the one-meter com-
petition, and placing third in the
three-meter, less than two points
behind second place Rich Maurone
of Penn State. Both‘Fatyol and.
Miller qualiﬁed for the NCAA
competition. '
Freshman Dave Reeder was, as

Coach Coffey put it, “a real proﬁle
in determination.” After injuring a

- hamstring in the qualifying rounds

of the one-meter competition, he

, refused to cash in his chips. “He

just wouldn’t "quit because he

wanted to help the team,” said’

Coffey. Dave went on to place
fourth in the one-meter, and ninth
in the three-‘meter.

But the. divers are used to
adversity. Wasn’t Tom Fatyol sick
just before the Easterns? “Sick?

_ He damn near died”_ said Coffey.

‘_‘.He was just getting some of his

timing back two days ago, and look .

at his performance."

It seemed as though the Panthers
were up against nine opponents for
much of the contest, but three third
period goals allowed the Cats to
ﬁnish the regular season schedule
of the Western Pennsylvania Inter-
collegiate Hockey Association

penalties in the game, while CMU
was called for only seven infrac-
tions. The penalties-in-minutes
statistic, orthe total time spent in
the penalty box, was equally ap-
palling--46 minutes for Pitt and a
mere 17 for the Tartans.

Further showing the incompe-
tence of the officials, one of the
linesmen could not skate well

enough to put himself into position _

to call plays. It appeared he
tripped over the blue line, a feat
accomplished several times.

The Panthers were forced to play
at a two-man disadvantage on four
different occasions, once for 1:23,
and another time for just over a
minute when CMU scored a power
play goal.

Pitt defenseman Russ Stump was
given a double minor in the second
period for an altercation in which
the Tartan skater’s actions were
overlooked by the referee. The
Panthers ended up playing one
mag down for a total of four

 minutes due to a very bad call.

Despite the shoddy officiating, the
Panthers still came out on top,
though it was an uphill battle all
the way. Down 2-1 going into the
final period, the Cats needed two
goals from Val Troy to take . the
lead.

Troy, playing with a borrowed
stick after his was ruled illegal by
the referee, sent a hard shot past
goalie Doug Johnston at the 3:09
mark, and then another only two

minutes later.
Jeff Saunders made it 4-2 with

‘ 6:39 gone, adding another game-

winning goal to his credit. A late
rally by the Tartans fell short,
though Dave Cornelius scored with
ﬁve minutes remaining to cut the
margin to one.

The Panthers drew first blood
when Stump riﬂed in a thirty-footer
only 1:15 into the game, but CMU,
somewhat aided by the refs, took
control of the action after that.

Matt Goldsmithscored in the first
period, which ended in a 1-1 tie.
Cornelius got the ﬁrst of his two
goals in. the second frame by
knocking a loose puck in the crease.

Both tallies were power play goals
and could be blamed only on the
officials, who were whistling off
Panther skaters right and left.

The Panthers were outshot by
CMU 30-23, the ﬁrst time ‘a
WPIHA opponent has turned the

‘trick this year, forcing Johnny

DeFazio to put on another fine
performance in the Pitt goal.

Pitt coach Len Barcalow was
pleased with the way his players
handled themselves while every
two of three calls were going
against them.

“Not onetime did these guys ever
quit. They’re real tough and they’ll
get tougher. When it comes down
to this league‘, after Pitt everyone
else is number two.”

Well said. But even if Pitt’s
WPIHA opponents ‘tried harder,

4"." foul shot by WYU’s Stan ‘Bos-
s kovich, and ﬁred a 30-footer that
7 just fell short. '
Nobody could have blamed the
,1 " " Cats if they had just closed up shop
for the season, but sparked‘ by the
 possibility of an NIT invitation, the
 Cats rolled over George Washing-
ton in Saturday night's consolation
' /’ game. ,
- The Cats gained an early 7-6 lead.
 Keith Starr, who scored 20 to lead
 " the Cats, then hit two baskets, and
 Bennett got two to put Pitt in front
-  15-6. The Colonials got back within
.,jj;:’ six, but Pitt put the ‘amoeba’ in
1 ' . ‘gear and buried GW in the next few
 minutes, going in front by 18 at the
. I end of the half.

1.  p 

George Washington wasn’t able
to cut into the Pitt lead in the
second half, and Ridl was soon able

to substitute freely. Even the Pitt ‘

subs were in ﬁne form, stretching
the lead to 89-64.

“We really went after this
game," said Ridl. “It wasn't just a
consolation. We prepared for it
like a normal game with a ‘team
meeting and drills.” V ,

The preparation paid off in the

imam. m,.t97s’,1    . 1

extension, of their season for at
least another week and maybe two.
They received the NIT bid yester-
day morning and will join the likes
of Clemson, St. .John’s, Oregon,
Southern Illinois, South Carolina,
Memphis State, Massachusetts,
Princeton, Holy Cross, Oral
Roberts, and Manhattan in New
York City this weekend. The
opening round pairings have not
been announced yet.

GRADUATE STUDENT to baby-

BY JIM SPANOS

Thirty-two teams have been
selected by the NCAA to partici-
pate in the tournament that will
determine the National Champion
March 31 in San Diego. Most of the
conference champions and
runners-up have been determined,
and the opening rounds in the
Eastern, Mideastern, Midwestern
and Western regionals will begin
Saturday.

In the Eastern Regional, it will be
LaSalle vs. Syracuse, North Caro-
lina vs. New Mexico State, Furman
vs. Boston College and Penn vs.
the Big 8 Runner-up. The victors in
the first two games will play March
20, as will the winners of the last
two contests. Then those two
winners will play in the Eastern
Regional Championship game
Mareh22.

In the Mideast, the Mid-American
Conference champ will play
Georgetown, and it will be
Marquette vs. the Southeastern
conference champ. Indiana will
play the Western Athletic Confer-

ence runnerup, and Middle Ten-

nessee will battle ghe PAC_ 8
runner-up. In the Mideastern
Regional Semiﬁnals March 20, the
winners of the first twogames will
play each other, as will the winners
of the last two. games. Then those
two winners will battle for the
Mideastern Regional Champion-
ship. ‘

In the Midwestern Regional, the
format is the same. The winners of
the Texas A&M vs. Cincinnatti/and
Louisville vs. Rutgers games will
play in the Midwestern semis. And
in the lower bracket, it will be
Creighton vs. the ACC Runner-up
and Notre Dame vs. Kansas. The
winners of these games play March
20.‘ Whoever emerges victorious in
the upper bracket plays the winner
of the lower bracket in the

Setter and Terrior, 2 months old.

‘Midwestern Regional Champion-
ship March 22.

Completing the coast to coast
journey is the Western Regional
affair. The field lines up like this:
.Arizona State vs. the SEC
Runnerup- and Nevada vs. Las
vs. San Diego. The winner of this
bracket plays the winner of: UCLA '
vs. Big 10 Runner-up and Montana  M
vs. Utah State, in the Westeli-ti"-""9
Regional Championship game in
the Portland Coliseum March 22.

. In San Diego March 29 it will be
the Eastern Regional champ vs. the
Mideastern Regional winner and
the Midwestern Regional champ
vs. the Western Regional champ.

And then, on March 31 the
National Championship and Con-
solation games will be played.

Some semblance of order can be

' made of this by eliminating some

teams that don’t appear to have

much chance of winning the- ‘
National Championship. Thus, it
appears North Carolina, Furman

and Penn will fight it out for the_.«£§:-.2
Eastern crown, while Marquette, O
the Southeastern Conference
champ, Indiana and the PAC 
runner-up will have the best shot in
the Mideastern section.

In the Midwest, Louisville,
Cincinnatti, the ACC runner-up
and Kansas rank supreme.

And in the West UCLA should
make it to the ﬁnals to contest_one
of the four teams in the upper
bracket: Arizona State, "the SEC
runnerup, Nevada, or San Diego.

One might look for Penn to play
Indiana and the ACC runner-up to
play UCLA in the_ national
semifinals, and Indiana to play the
ACC runner-up for the National
Championship. . '

Don’t be surprised if the "ACC
runner-up surprises everyone by
taking the National crown.
