Pitt student
hospitalized
after stabbing

By Mark Staf
Sta_[f Writer

A Pitt sophomore was rushed to Presbyterian
University Hospital Friday night after he was stabbed
during a party in a South Oakland apartment.

According to Pittsburgh police reports, William
Birdsall allegedly stabbed the victim at a party on
377 S. Bouquet St., after the victim and Birdsall got
into a fistfight.

According to a city police report, the victim was
in the bathroom with his girlfriend. Birdsall pounded
on the door, saying that he needed to use the
bathroom. When the victim opened the door,
Birdsall entered the bathroom and began yelling at
the victim and his girlfriend.

Birdsall and the victim stepped out of the bathroom
and began fighting. Then Birdsall stabbed the
victim with a knife, according to the report.

Pittsburgh police reported that the victim was
stabbed in the abdomen and face. Gary Moses,
assistant director of Pitt’s Public Safety Department,
listed the victim’s injuries as “multiple stab wounds
to the face, arms and abdomen.”

The victim, who is now in fair condition at
Presbyterian University Hospital, said, “[Birdsa1ll
cut me on my nose and arms.” He added that his
arms are bandaged, and he has stitches on his nose.

Police at the scene got a description of the
perpetrator and the license-plate number of the car
he was driving. Less than a half-hour later, campus
police spotted a suspect with blood on his jeans and
who matched the description given by witnesses.
Police also identified the car bearing the reported
plate number.

Moses said, “Two of our units stopped the

Anyone trying to ask questions to Telefact, the Student

Stag‘ Writers

The recently opened Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall parking garage has brought some welcome
changes for people facing the Oakland parking
dilemma.

According to Jan Thomas of Pitt's Parking Office,
the new lot means a great increase in the number
of parking permits available to members of the
university community.

“We have 800 permits in there now. It's increased

those [permits] available by a little over 400,” said
Thomas.

With a construction cost of approximately $18
million, the garage is being managed by an outside
firm, ALCO Parking, and contains spaces for
approximately 950 vehicles.

Thomas said that nearly 400 permits have been
transferred to the Soldiers and Sailors garage, with
the remaining spaces being available to Pitt
employees, students and visitors on a daily basis.

According to Thomas, Pitt does not make a profit
from the garage, since permits cost only $60 per

See Parking, page 4

If one of the two phone lines are down, calling T elefact may
result in a busy signal or unanswered ringing.

“People are calling SGB and saying all kinds of unkind things:
‘Why the hell aren’t they answering their phones?’ Of course,
that's the polite version,” she said. “We’re not answering it
because it’s not ringing, because the phone line is dead."

A serviceperson fixed the dead phone line on Monday
morning, but the trouble didn’t stop there, Giangarlo said.

“Now the other phone line is dead,” she said. “We at least got
the computer back up, which is good news because we weren’t
on with the computer. It was inoperative for three days."

She added that this has caused serious problems for Telefact,
which receives up to 230 calls a day. Friday is one of the busiest
days. “I’m sure we lost a lot of calls from people who really
wanted an answer," sheisaid.

Giangarlo, who deniesjrumors that the problems over the
weekend were caused  prankish leprechauns, said that the
problem should be ﬁxed by this morning.

Volunteers prepare for Hand—in-Hand

University of Pittsburgh
students who are willing to give
a little of their time and their love
have volunteered for the 1991
Hand-in-Hand Festival.

Initiated in 1979, the Hand-in-
Hand Festival began as a day for
handicapped children in the
Pittsburgh area (with the help
and guidance of University of
Pittsburgh student volunteers) to
come together, have fun, be
entertained and experience each

other.

The annual Hand-in—Hand
Festival will be held this Saturday
on the main floor of Forbes Quad
from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m.

According to Sharon
McCracken, a senior staff member
of Hand-in-Hand, “We have
received letters of commendation
from [Pittsburgh Mayor] Sophie
Masloff, as well as Ronald Reagan
and George Bush.

“Primarily what the festival is
trying to do is provide a day of
entertainment and recreation for
handicapped children in the city

of Pittsburgh. In the past we have
had such celebrities as the Pirate
Parrot, the B-94 Bee and several
[Pittsburgh] Steelers,” said
McCracken.

Over 400 children are expected
to attend the festival, McCracken
said.

According to McCracken, “Each
child will be paired up with a
volunteer Pitt student. We call
them one-on—one‘s. The students
will spend the entire day with the
child they are assigned to.”

The festival, which includes a

Coping on Campus...

End of a relationship isn't the end of the world

The breakup of a love
relationship can be one of the
most disruptive and upsetting
things that can happen to a college
student. The loss of an intimate
partner, especially if the loss is
unexpected, can create emotional
havoc in an individual's life, and
the person suffering the loss
sometimes goes through stages
of grief as intense as if the loved
one had died.

Initially, there is a period of
shock and disbelief and the
student perhaps will appeal to
the rejecting partner to reconsider.
in this early stage, there may be
uncontrollable crying spells, fear
of losing one’s sanity, difficulty
with sleeping and eating, thoughts
that life is not worth living any
more and often a complete
cessation of any academic work
that requires concentrated effort.
This state of disbelief, confusion
and panic may last for several

 

Dr: err
Gallagher

days or several weeks.

This time period is usually
followed by a period of intense
anger. There are feelings of being
treated unfairly or of being
cheated out of happiness, and
often great rage at the rejecting
person. Then, as the rage begins

to subside, depressed feelings
may occur. The distraught person
may withdraw from friends,
become less communicative and
perhaps go through a period of
self-doubt about his or her own
self-worth. Frequently, there is
also the terrifying feeling that the
loneliness, the pain and the
unhappiness will go on forever.

Fortunately, it doesn’t. Most
students gradually begin to find
strength within themselves to
recover. Some do it on their own
or with the help of friends, and
many seek out a professional
counselor or a trusted member of
the clergy to help them through
the crisis. As their coping skills
kick in, they begin to find new
people to do things with and new
activities to fill the void in their
lives. Eventually, they are able to
let go of the old relationship and,
while the pain may linger for
some time, they are able to

appreciate new relationships and
find other things that give
meaning to their lives.

One thing that all people who
are suffering this kind of
emotional loss need to know is
that many other people have gone
through this experience and
survived. In fact, it’s the rare
person who gets through life
without having his or her heart
broken at least once. As painful
as it is, getting through it is almost
always strengthening. When
you've hit the depths and climbed
back out again, you discover
coping skills that can be put to
good use for the rest of your life.
At least that's what I tell myselfas
I lick some of my old love wounds.

If you have a concern that you
would like to see addressed, send
it to Dr. Robert Gallagher,
Counseling and Student
Development Center, 3 34 William
Pitt Union.

Students get tulture shoe/e’ over Break

By Jackie Estkowski
saw‘ Writer

Instead ofbaking in the sun on
a crowded beach in Daytona or
drinking out of glasses with
miniature paper umbrellas in
Cancun, 10 students from Pitt
decided to experience a different
kind of spring break this year.
For one week, these students
belonging to Pitt’s YMCA lived
on a farm in Appalachia, Ky.

The collegiate YMCA chapters
from the University of Pittsburgh
and St. joseph’s College in
Philadelphia participated in the
program, which was created by
former Pitt mechanical-
engineering student Doug Bajack.
Bajack, who will be the farm
manager until May, wanted to
give students an opportunity to
become aware ofthe Appalachian
culture and to do work projects.

This is the second year that Pitt
has participated in the program.
Last year, students in Pitt’s YMCA
went to Vanceburg, Ky.

“We helped on the farm one
day feeding cows and chickens,”

said Gloria Townsend, the
coordinator of Pitt’s YMCA, “and
we visited local families.”

According to Townsend, the
group visited a paraplegic’s family
and worked with Peoples
Appalachia to help landscape,
paint and insulate the farnily’s
home.

The group also performed a
concert for the residents of a
nursing home and played cards
with mentally ill patients.

“The kids had an overwhelming
response," Townsend said. “They
loved it.”

Townsend said the group
visited families living high in the
mountainous regions, where they
had no contact with others.

“The families loved for the

students to visit, " said Townsend.
“Some of them even asked what
country we came from. It was a
great experience. Everyone was
hugging and kissing and crying.”

Townsend described the
experience as a cultural shock.
She said there was no refuse
collection, and a lot of children
were not educated because
school buses could not travel
into the hills.

Like the people ofAppalachia,
the group chopped wood for
fires to keep warm, washed
outdoors and used an outhouse.
The students also slept in
bunkhouses, with the women in
one and the men in another.

instruments.

The attire worn in the toga competition ranged from classical
to daring with bright hues in gold, violet, sapphire, red and
silver. There was even a tie-dyed entry.

The comedy routine, a new addition to this year’s competition,
allowed the participants to try their luck at entertaining the
audience with jokes and short, funny anecdotes.

Match group three was announced as the overall winner of
Sunday's Greek Olympiad, with match group four in second
place and match group five in third.

free lunch for the children, offers
booths and various entertainers

throughout Forbes Quad.

“So far we have secured about
40 booths to entertain the
children, and we have magicians
and whatnot," said McCracken.
In previous years, Beautiful
Hands, a Pitt sign-language
performance group, and the Pitt
cheerleaders have performed, she
said.

The one-on-one volunteers will

escort the children to the different
booths and activities.
’ As a senior staff member,
McCracken is involved in the
promotional and fund-raising
aspects of the festival.

According to McCracken, the
one-day event will cost
approximately $13,000. “We need
to Contact local businesses and
also alumni; it’s a lot of contact
work, phone calls and letters,
etc,” she said.

Christina Teramana, a member
of Hand-in—Hand, said, “Through
the years, there have been a lot of
local organizations willing to

participate, and they keep
sponsoring and donating money
to the festival."

Teramana, also a senior
facilitator, has been involved with
Hand—in-Hand for four years.
Teramana and Susan Hellman
are two of the main facilitators
and have approximately 45
volunteer students under their
direction. These students are also
facilitators “who are more or less
the eyes and ears of the festival,”
said Teramana.

According to Teramana, “They
have more of an educational
background. They have to be
certified in CPR, and they have to
take four educational classes,

which include Seizure
Management, Behavior
Modification, Manual Feeding and
Wheelchair Safety.

“There is also a medical staff
facility at the festival in case of
emergencies," said Teramana.

Up until this week, the members
of Hand-in-Hand have been
recruiting the one-on—one
volunteers.

According to McCracken, all

Pitt students are eligible to apply,
regardless of major or work-
oriented background.

“They don’t need any type of
special education degree.
[Information for the job] will be
provided,” she said.

“All we are looking for is a
student who wants to spend a
day with a child,” she said.

Once accepted, the one-on-
one volunteers must attend a
one-hour session prior to the
festival, where they will receive
medical information on their
partner.

“They will receive a medical-
history card, and on this card will
be the child’s name, any type of
allergies, medications, etc., so
the volunteer will know about
the child before they actually are
paired up,” said McCracken.

Many of the children expected
at the festival have participated in
the festival for more than one
year

McCracken said, “A lot of the
children come year after year.

“We are hoping that the
children, as well as the students,

will have an enjoyable day.”

McCracken chose to get
involved through hearing positive
feedback from previous members.
Many of the current members are
ones who got involved their
freshman year and chose to stay
with Hand-in-Hand throughout
their college career, said
McCracken.

“The children benefit from this
festival. This is one day out of the
entire year, and they look forward
to it," said T eramana. “When you
leave this festival, you don’t take
what you have for granted
anymore.”

Teramana is hoping that
everything will be ready by
Saturday at 11 a.m. “I think we
will be ready,” said Teramana,
“for those children to walk in
with high anticipation for the
festival to begin.

“I think that I know I have
accomplished something when I
see the children smiling and
laughing and having a good time.
Just as long as these children are
content, I have what I want,” said
Teramana.

garage, she added.

Some of the Pitt faculty
and staff who use the new
Soldiers and Sailors garage
were formerly assigned to
the SB lot on South Bouquet
Street. Since the Soldiers
and Sailors garage opened,
the South Bouquet lot has
been converted to student
parking only.

University employee and
evening student permits are
no longer available in the
South Bouquet lot.

“I think there's enough of
a demand from commuting
students [to turn the SB lot
into student—only parkingl,”
said Thomas.

No student permits are
available for the Soldiers
and Sailors lot.

The daily rate for the SB
lot for those with a Pitt
student ID is $3. The
evening rate, which begins
at 4 p.m., is $2. The SB lot
operates from 7 am. to 8
p.m. Monday through
Friday only.

Hours of the Soldiers and
Sailors garage, officially
known as the SS lot, are 7
a.m. to 11 p.m. daily, unless
it is a university holiday.
“We ask that everyone try
to have their cars out of the
lot at least before midnight,"
said Thomas.

Until 4 p.m. on weekdays,
the SS garage charges an
hourly parking rate.

After 4 p.m., a flat rate of
$2 will be charged.
Weekend parking in the SS
garage is $2.50 per day for
those without permits.

“There is usually parking
[space] available then," said
Thomas.

Continuous security in the
SS garage is being provided
by the DHS Security
Company, based in
Carnegie, Pa.

Two security guards
cover daily shifts at the
garage, working from 6 a. m.
to 3 p.m., then 3 p.m. to
midnight.

In addition to viewing
television monitors, which
are located in and around
the garage, the guards make
routine nightly patrols
around the parking garage.

Brutality a vicious cycle...

For the past two weeks, the country has focused its
attention on Los Angeles, where 25-year-old Rodney
King was brutally beaten by people who are trained to
prevent such occurrences.

Four Los Angeles police officers brutalized King after
stopping him for speeding. The attack was caught on
video, placing the officers under heavy scrutiny. They
now face charges ranging from aggravated assault to
falsifying reports in an attempt to cover the incident.

Disturbing as this beating was, Los Angeles residents
have seemingly become used to it. A March 10 poll
published in the LosAngeles Times said that a majority of
people in the city believe that police violence is common.
This fact could be even more threatening than the beating
itself.

The problem runs much deeper than this single incident.
Police brutality only accentuates the vicious circle that
revolves around law enforcement. All law enforcement
officers, both police and National Guardsmen, are trained
to uphold the law and take defensive action if necessary.

“Citizens, however, do not like the idea that these
officers could do something illegal or have different
interpretations of the law, making any person working in
law enforcement unpopular in the community.

People begin to get restless when taken aside by
authority, and they talk back to such authority. As the
tension grows, police feel that they must exert more
pressure to do their job.

But with the increase of incidents such as this, the trust
in the law enforcers decreases, thereby tempting the
public to question authority more often.

It is when law enforcement officers overreact to civilian
outbursts, however, that police brutality results, as it did
in Los Angeles, and as the National Guard did at Kent
State in 1972.

This fact, however, does not excuse these four officers.
The brutal beating of King was more than out of line. It
was an example of gross injustice and misuse of power.
They must be dealt with as common criminals, as their
actions merit.

When those people who are trained to defend us from
lawbreakers break the law themselves, people like King
get caught in the middle and the mistrust grows.

At some point in time, someone with some sort of
authority misused that power to his own benefit and
began this destructive cycle. Mistrust on both sides
eventually grew until both sides were constantly at each
other’s throats, with charges flying of brutality and
defiance running rampant.

And until both sides realize that each is at fault, the cycle
will continue. Frightening as it seems, incidents such as
this could ultimately become commonplace.

Selfish people are everywhere

I am selfish. I am not ashamed
or embarrassed by this fact. Why
not’ Because everyone is selfish.

Now, before everyone is
mortally insulted or outraged by
such a statement, let me explain.
Maybe “self-interested" is a better
word. Then again, maybe not.
The dictionary definition of
“selfish” is “being concerned
excessively or exclusively with
oneself." But another, less well-
known definition is “believing
that the chief motives of human
action are derived from love of
self.”

In other words, people are
inherently selﬂsh —-— not selﬂess
—— and it makes sense that this is
the case. Selﬂessness, which is
acting without or having no
concern for yourself, is a strange
concept. You see, I don’t think
selfishness or se1f—interest are
good or bad things. They are
reality. People think ofthernselves
first in most cases, and they
probably should. The danger
arises when people don’t realize
this fact of life.

For example, I don’t understand
how anyone could have thought
that our primary motivation in
the Persian Gulf war was to free
the Kuwaiti people. This is not a
criticism of U.S. foreign policy.
My point, however, is thatl cannot
remember a time when any
country acted in a way that did
not involve its own best interests.
Freeing Kuwait was a good thing,
but that’s not why we got
involved.

As children, we are truly self-

 

Jason
Hillman

absorbed, selfish entities. As we
grow older, we are taught to
share and try to be unselfish. The
interesting final product is people
who usually act in their own best
interests but like to think that
they don’t. We as a country have
gotten involved with many other
countries, officially and
unofficially, and the only constant
is that we have acted selfishly in
every case. Our government used
the cases where our own interests
and the “right thing to do”
coincided to make it look as if the
United States were acting as a
moral, honorable and selﬂess
country because that is what its
citizens wanted to hear.

The scary thing about
selfishness is that it acts
independently of any morality.
We, as a country, supported

,Manuel Noriega for many years

because his support of the United
States was strong and his control
of the country was powerful.
From the U.S. point of view, he

was a perfect ally.

Then, with the contract on the
Panama Canal expiring in the
near future and Noriega ’s alliance
with the United States weakening,
we suddenly exposed him as a
tyrant and drug trafficker and
decided it was imperative that we
topple him from power. Yet we
were willing to tolerate him as
long as he was a solid ally. Our
policies never had anything to do
with morality.

The important thing to
remember is that to act truly
selflessly, you must realize that
you are basically selfish. But the
fact of the matter is that a person
should not act entirely selfishly
or selﬂessly but should aim for a
sort of enlightened selfishness;
that is, self-interest tempered by
your own moral standards of what
is right or wrong.

I still admire people who
commit selfless acts, but I
understand that there are no
selﬂess people. Even people who
are always doing things for other
people are not selﬂess. If pressed,
they will say, “Well, I like helping
other people." They are doing
what they want to do.

It is selfishness that keeps me
from celebrating the Persian Gulf
victory with a lot of enthusiasm.
I see my government, the
individuals in it and as a whole,
acting with my selfishness, but
without showing many of the
moral checks that I hope I have.

Baseball team off to best start in five years

By Bob Maselli
Smﬂ‘ Writer

The Pitt Panther baseball team is on a
roll. After 16 games, it has compiled an 8-
8 record, won its last six games, has more
stolen bases this year so far than all of last
year, has played exceptional defense and
is full of enthusiasm.

All of the above was missing last year.
This team is working on its best start in
ﬁve years and looking for its best season
even

This past weekend, the Panthers played
some exciting baseball, thanks largely to
the more aggressive style of play new
head coach Mark Jackson has brought to
the team. Jackson, who came to Pitt from

Point Park College, where he compiled
an impressive 291-53 record over eight
years, replaced Bobby Lewis, Pitt’s coach
of 36 years.

Last Friday against Davis and Elkins
College, the Panthers won both ends of a
doubleheader 4-3 and 9-6.

Denny Little, a ﬁfth—year senior and
designated hitter, cranked a three-run
home run in the first inning of the ﬁrst
game. Little, who has been coming through
for the Panthers with his powerful bat,
almost didn’t make the squad this season.
At this point, he’s batting well over .500.

On Saturday, Mercyhurst, who beat Pitt
in Florida during the “Boardwalk and
Baseball” series over spring break, lost
both games in a doubleheader to the

Panthers 4-3 and 3-2.

Shortstop Ralph McNelly had the game-
winning RBI in game one when he drove
home Brad Reese in the bottom of the
seventh inning.

In the second game, former Big East
Rookie of the Year Bill Sherbondy hit a
two—run homer to help the Panthers to
victory. Pitcher Chris Wittgartner got the
save.

Finally, on Sunday, the Panthers capped
off the weekend with two more wins in
another doubleheader against New York
State College.

Pitt won the first game 20-10, and the
second 12-2. Both games were called at
the end of six and ﬁve innings, respectively,
because of the "10-run rule.”

In the first game, the Panthers were
down by ﬁve runs in the ﬁrst inning, but
they came from behind and showed their
new “never-say-die” attitude.

Marc Picciano got the pitching victory,
and Rick Yuskas had three hits, including
a grand slam, a home run and six RBIs.

In the second game, Wittgartner again
got the win, and in both games combined
the Panthers stole 15 bases.

PIT!‘ BITS: The Panthers’ next game
will be today against Slippery Rock. The
Panthers will play IUP on Wednesday.
Both games are doubleheaders. Both have
1 p.m. starting times, and both are at Trees
Field. The Panthers’ first Big East game is
on Saturday against St. Johns at Trees
Field at 1 p.m.

Perry Miller took eighth at the NCAAs en route to becoming an All-American.

Two Panther wrestlers who have
performed well all season have ﬁnally
reached their goals and earned All-
American honors. In the process, juniors
Scott Hovan (158 pounds) and Perry
Miller (heavyweight) have shone some
light onto a team that went a disappointing
4-12.

I-Iovan and Miller ended up sixth and
eighth, respectively, at the NCAA
Tournament in Iowa last week and gave
Pitt a No. 27 ranking out of over 90 teams
at the event. "  > I ~ Y

Both wrestlers were redshirted last
year, and head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said that is the reason why both men did
so well this season.

“We redshirted Perry and Scott last
year, and we knew it would hurt the
team in the short run, but it would be
beneﬁcial to them in the long run,” said
Stottlemyer.

“They showed how good they were
this year.”

Hovan, seeded fourth in the nation
going into the tournament, advanced to

the semiﬁnals but lost to second-year

national champion Pat Smith of
Oklahoma State. Hovan stayed in the
match the whole way but lost on riding
time, 5-4.

Hovan, who was 24-2 on the year and
was praised by Stottlemyer all year as the
“go-to man,” could be a future national
champion, something he has talked about

all season. Although he didn’t accomplish  
that this year, his successes this season 

were nothing short of fantastic.

unseeded wrestler but ended up as one

Gymnasts set new meet record

By Sharon Kerestes
Staff Writer

The men’s gymnastics team
pulled out a narrow victory over
Kent State and set a new meet
record to win the Great Lakes
Championships Saturday at Trees
Hall.

Pitt scored a season-high 272.10
points, breaking the seven-year-
old record of 268.60 set by Kent
State. Kent was second with
271.75, followed by William and
Mary (262.65), the University of
Wisconsin-Oshkosh (244.95),
Radford College (243.10) and
James Madison University
(215.25). .

Pitt and Kent State met twice

already this season and split the
victories. Since none of the other
teams in the meet was equipped
to challenge them, the two were
destined to battle it out for the
championship title.

The Panthers got off to a strong
start on rings and scored 46.3 to
break the meet record. But they
couldn’t relax because Kent
wasn’t far behind. Coach Frank
D’Amico said he wasn’t sure
throughout the meet just how
close it was. ‘I only knew after
the ﬁrst three events that we
were up by 1.7,” he said. At that
point Pitt was taking its turn on
vault, and Kent was on parallel
bars.

D’Amico said his vault strategy

Outdoor track boasts

in practice was to cutback on the
difﬁculty of the routines and work
instead of polishing simpler tricks.
“I just wanted them to land on
their feet,” he said — which they
did. The Panthers scored a solid
45.3 and then sat back to watch
Kent complete its turn on parallel
bars. But they didn’t appreciate
what they saw. Kent scored 45.7
and set a new meet record for that
event, putting the pressure on
Pitt to score well on its turn on
parallel bars.

“They did really well, and that
worried me. It’s been our plaguing
event all year,” D’Amico said. “I
was just hoping we could score
45. As it was, we had major

Spring is creeping around the corner, and the weather is
slowly getting warmer. Hence, it’s time to get off the couch, go
outside and breathe in some of that fresh, clean 0) Pittsburgh
air. The Pitt men’s track team will be doing just that as it makes
the transition from indoor to outdoor track.

After a very successful indoor season, including two All-
Americans in Elbert Ellis and Keith Dowling, the squad is ready
to get outdoors and show its skills. Coach John Vasvary is
looking forward to the new campaign.

“We should be pretty good in every event on the track,”
Vasvary said. “We should be outstanding in the ﬁeld events,
especially in the Big East. Although we are a freshman- and
sophomore-dominated team, we will get good leadership from

See Track, page 8

our seniors, especially Dowling
and Ellis. If everyone develops,
we could take a shot at the
outdoor Big East title.”

Vasvary said the Big East will
be extremely competitive and
that Georgetown and Syracuse
have extremely strong teams.

Pitt has two fresh faces in the
javelin event. Newcomers Scott
Bailey and Jeff Herman are
looking forward to the challenge.

“T he traditional source of
strength should not be let down
this year," Vasvary said. “Bailey
and Herman should do very well
in the Big East.”

The shot and discus events are
in the capable hands of junior
Dave Senay, a former Big East
champion, and freshman Jim
Monk, who has greatly improved
indoors in the shot event.

In the high jump, Pitt is led by
Big East scorer Tim Flanders.

who marked ‘a best jump of 6
feet, 8 1/2 inches.

“Flanders was a Big East scorer
indoors, along with fellow
freshman Myron Parran, who
finished seventh in the Big East
indoors; both should do well.”

All-American Ellis leads the
squad in the 110-meter and the
400m hurdles. The two-time
outdoor school-record holder in
the 400 will be trying to improve
on his impressive marks after
finishing second in the nation in
the 55m hurdles event at the
NCAA Championships in
Indianapolis.

Ellis will be joined by Brett
Shields, who racked up an
outstanding indoor season and
placed fourth in both events at
the Eastern Championships

(IC4As). Franz Jobson will also
be participating in both events
after he recovers from some
nagging leg injuries.

“Franz seems to get these
nagging injuries just before the
outdoor season,” Vasvary said.
“But we’re pretty confident that
he’ll be back in time to do very
well in both hurdles.”

Vasvary’s 4 x 400m relay team,
consisting of Jobson, James
Thompson, Neil Malobicky and
Justin Walls, previously finished
fourth in the IC4A mile indoor
relay and is considered one of
the fastest teams in the Big East.

The 5- and 10—kiIometer events
are led by All-American Dowling,
who still holds school records in
both events. Dowling has already
qualified for the outdoor NCAA

Championships in Eugene, Ore.,
by ﬁnishing sixth in the NCAA
indoor 5,000m event.

“Keith is ninning great, " Vasvary
said. “It was one of the best races
he ever competed in, and it will
catapult him into the outdoor
season.”

Joining Dowling will be junior
Mike Formica, who placed sixth
in the 5,000m at the IC4As.

The team is considered one of
the best in the country and already
boasts All-American athletes.

“Our team is competing against
world—class athletes, and they
have already proven themselves,”
Vasvary said. “Buteveryone wants
to perform better, and they feel
that they are very capable. I’m
really looking forward to this
season.”

Women's tennis posts upfour Wins at PSU Invitational

By Kenn Gajther
stag Writer

Returning from an impressive
.500 spring-break trip to Florida,
the Pitt women’s tennis team kept
the ball rolling at the Penn State
Invitational this weekend with
some solid individual
performances.

The invitational, a “flighted”
tournament, displayed the talents
of six teams: Pitt, Penn State,
George Mason, Seton Hall,
Mercyhurst and Mount St. Mary’s
College. In a flighted tournament,
each player is seeded in a bracket
with a player Of the same ranking.

breaks. They beat us by two
points On parallel bars, and boy,
did that hurt.”

While Pitt was faltering On
parallel bars, Kent was having a
successful turn on high bar. Kent
scored 46.2 and broke another
meet record.

D’Amico estimated Pitt was
behind by three-tenths going into
the final event, and he wasn't
sure his team could make up the
difference. For one thing, the
Panthers’ last event was high bar,
a team trouble spot. Kent State,
meanwhile, was finishing on
vault. D’Amico figured Kent
would have no problem scoring
45 points to sew up the win.

But Pitt’s high-bar team came
through. Damon DiFabio and
Genaro Severino each scored 9.45,
and Dave Bausmith, Kyle
MacBeth and Brock Freehling
scored 9.35, 9.15 and 8.55,
respectively, giving Pitt a 45.85.
Kent had a tough time on vault
and finished with a 44.05.

“The key was Our middle squad
On high bar, especially Damon
[DiFabiOl,” D’Amico said. DiFabio
scored 9.55 in finals-——a personal
best — and placed second in
finals.

Severino dominated the
individual competition, capturing
first places in the all-arou nd, rings
and vault, and tying for first on
floor. He tied the meet record on
rings (9.6) and set a new record
in the all-around (55.5). He also
tied for fourth place with William
and Mary’s Tim Tozer On parallel
bars. Pitt’s Jorge Gonzalez was
third in the all-around and split a
three-way tie for second on
pommel horse with Dave
Bausmith and Mark Shumaker of
Wisconsin-Oshkosh. Mike Englert
added a fourth-place finish on
rings.

This weekend, the Panthers
compete in their final meet ofthe
season at the National
Independent Championships at
the University of Western
Michigan. The meet will feature
some of the more competitive
teams from around the country,
including Air Force, Illinois,
Michigan and Kent State. It will
be Pitt’s last chance to qualify for
NCAA regionals.

“’Ihey’re determined,” D’Amico
said. “They’re trying to stay
focused. We’ve just got to pull it
off one more time.”

In some cases, players competed
against teammates. For this
reason, none of the six teams
was declared a “winner.” The
matches were all championship,
meaning there were no
consolation rounds.

Julie LoPrinzi, Pitt’s NO. 1
singles player, led the team with
two singles victories, defeating
her first opponent from Mount
St. Mary’s 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 and Tracy
Longo Of Seton Hall 5-7, 6-3, 6-2.
Reaching the semifinals, she lost
to Penn State’s Jen Farington 6-0,
64).

hamstring,” LoPrinzi said.

The only other singles victory
was recorded byjill Cohen, who
defeated Colleen McDonald Of
George Mason 7-5, 6-1.

In doubles action, the duo Of
LoPrinzi and Erika Devins
recorded Pitt’s lone win and
advanced to the second round
before losing to Penn State.

“We played well and were
psyched, but Penn State is just a
powerhouse," LoPrinzi said.

Devins missed playing last fall
due to a stress fracture, and is
beginning to regain the form that
makes her vital to the team’s
success.
