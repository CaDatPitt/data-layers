Student in Tower A sexually assaulted

A woman reported to Pitt Police
that she was sexually assaulted on the
morning of Saturday, Feb. 21, in
Litchﬁeld Tower A. .

The victim says that while she was
walking on her ﬂoor sometimebetween
3 and 4 a.m., a man asked her for her
help. ' I

According to a bulletin issued by ‘
the Pitt Police, she went into the stair-
well with him, and he assaulted her.

Afterward, the man went down the

 

shirt and medium—dark
colored pants.

The victim reported
the crime in the evening
of Tuesday, Feb. 24.

To stay safe, police
suggest that students stay
aware of their surround-
ings and the people
around them and remain
cautious when strangers
approach for help.

All incidents should
be reported promptly to

stairwell.

The suspect has been described as a
5-foot-9-inch tall, white man between
18 and 20 years old, weighing about
200 pounds. ,

The victim also described him as having broad

Damage done to Clapp Hall

Three teaching assistants —— and a bit of a surprise
— greeted students outside Clapp Hall when they

Student assalted, fire moves classes

arrived for their Russian Fairy Tales class Monday
afternoon.

A fire Friday afternoon in Clapp Hall Auditorium,
where the class‘ is held, has shut down the 409—seat
lecture hall for the time being, according to Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs Robert Hill.

Officials responded quickly to the fire, which
burned three seats and caused some smoke damage
before it was contained.

The auditorium also incurred some water damage
While the fire was being contained, Hill said.

“It will be out of commission for a while,” Hill
said of the auditorium, adding that he does not yet
know how long the repairs will take.

The cause of fire is still under investigation, Hill
said, noting that the cause seemed “suspicious.” .

Until the auditorium reopens, classes will be held
elsewhere on campus — such as Bellefield
Auditorium, where the Russian  Tales class has
moved. i

It’s a mouthful at Gullifty’s annual Cake Fest

BRENDA MILLER
Staff Writer

The culprits deviously smiled
and laughed hysterically as
whipped cream and chocolate mess
slid from their faces. The same
slimy goop was smeared across the
floor and lined the once crisp, white
tablecloths.

No, this wasn’t the scene of a
preschool class run amuck, nor was
it evidence of a good, old—fashioned
food fight. It was, in fact, the third
annual Cake Fest hosted by
Gullifty’s restaurant in Squirrel
Hill, an event that benefited the
Amazing Kids of the Children’s
Institute of Pittsburgh.

Roughly 30 competitors sat at
the cafeteria—style seats and awaited
their fate. Their dark purple
Gullifty’s shirts and plastic aprons
identified their role in the glutto-
nous affair. They weren’t given any

silverware, but were supplied with
bottles of Aquafina to help it all go
down smoothly.

The audience that was spread
across the three balconies and ﬂoor-
side seats chanted the 10-second
countdown. Contestants were given
10 minutes to consume as many
chocolate cakes with dollops of
whipped cream in tin pans the size
of CDs as they could. Cash prizes
were awarded to one person of each
gender who finished the most‘ pies
and also to the most spirited eater,
whose face was completely covered
in the cake.

The friendly competition kicked
off with a rafﬂe of T-shirts from
Pepsi, MTV, Sierra Mist and more,
for both participants and spectators.
Vicki Cohill of 92.9 FM and
“Judge” from 96.9 FM functioned
as announcers for the third year in a
row. -

The event began three years ago

when Gullifty’s, said to have the
“Best Desserts” in town by
Pittsburgh, Magazine for 21 years,
baked a birthday cake in honor of
the 100th anniversary of the
Children’s Institute. The celebra-
tion turned into a contest to raise
money for the foundation.
Gullifty’s owner Mark Haste
admitted that this was the biggest
turnout yet, and hopes to have
raised $6,000, which would double
last year’s earnings. There were
more schools and groups involved

this year than individuals, for
example the Taylor Alderdice
Honor Society, Slippery Rock

Wresting and the enthusiastic group
from Seneca Valley. However, it
was a lone man that took home the
glory and the cash, packing away '12
of the chocolate delicacies. John
Kavulik decided to join this first
cake—eating contest on a whim, and.

he won. He gave thanks to’ his‘

mother’s good cooking.

“I just did it to eat he cake,” he
said with a smile. .

Last year’s winner Mark
O’Donnell, of the ' Children’s
Institute, was also pleased with the
day’s event.

“We always love to have kids
involved,” he said.

He was also glad that his record
of 14 cakes wasn’t broken.

The clean—up crew rolled
through the restaurant with 20-gal-
lon garbage cans, buckets of water,
and rags as two girls sat cleaning
the cake out of each others hair,
ears, and any other facial crevices.
The tablecloths were removed and
the gleaming finished wood tables
were revealed.No evidence of the
sticky chocolate mess or the chaos
of cheering as contestants shoveled

as much cake as they could ‘into '

their mouths would remain ...‘ well,
until next year. I

winds of change, remaining as testaments to the
country’s legacy of oppression —— and to the
challenges it faces in the future.

Much like the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, the
shantytowns sprawl out for miles. The huts and

shacks, constructed of _found materials, are"

jammed together on unpaved, dusty ground.
Streets, towns, and even communities, have
emerged out the improvisation. Some of the
townships have become models for social devel-
opment, giving rise to schools, medical facilities,
choirs and outreach programs for the youth.

Those are the ones they take the tourists to,
Nur explains.

With the improvement of any country’s pop-
ular image comes, perhaps inevitably, a burgeon-
ing tourist industry, and South Africa’s has
thrived in the years following the fall of the
apartheid regime. Township tours seem to be one
of the most popular tourist activities here, offer-
ing visitors the opportunity to see third-world
poverty firsthand and to purchase peace of mind.
On a township tour, you can take pictures with
residents, see the insides of their homes, eat
local food and hand out gifts to children.

Then you can get back on an air-conditioned‘

tour bus and commit the whole experience to
memory: how you made a difference by giving a
starving child a plastic toy, how you made a per-
sonal connection by taking a picture with some-
body.

The whole idea seems tasteless, troubling
and downright weird to me. Wouldn’t it make
more sense for the’ government to invest time,
money and energy to eliminate the townships,
rather than allowing the tourist industry to flaunt
the squalor of these communities and turn a prof-
it on it?

The Waterfront is a Disneyland-esque,
squeaky-clean assortment of shops, restaurants
and malls surrounding the area where ships like
our own S.S. Universe Explorer dock. The man-
ufactured beauty of the place is a picture of safe-
ty, afﬂuence and cosmopolitanism in which
money-wielding tourists can buy Levi’s in air-
conditioned comfort and eat food at places like
‘5Maria’s Cantina.” Tourism' companies man
booths ‘along the dock, offering skydiving,
bungee jumping, hiking expeditions and town-
ship tours. Men in traditional Zulu regalia wear
Converse All-Stars and dance for throngs of
enthralled visitors. All these westernized ameni-
ties, coupled with the spectacular view of Table
Mountain and the dry heat, reinforced an eerie
feeling that I was in Montana, rather than Africa.

But then again, that’s what most South

Africans will tell you about their country: that it 9

is worlds away from the continent with which is

shares a name. .
When I find myself in a place like the

Waterfront, I am reminded that, as I travel

around the world, there are people in every coun-
try investing a lot of money so that I can enjoy -

myself, without incident, in their country. In
turn, I will buy. many things in their country and
preach about its beauty and safety to my friends,
who will also travel to that country. Tourism is
an industry, and countries trying to cash in make
a concerted effort to cater to the lowest common
denominator of foreign adventurer.

He’s the one who prefers to shop at a mall
rather than a street market and eat KFC rather
than local cuisine — and, in turn, completely iso-
lates himself from the beauty and vibrancy of the
local culture. The hope is to provide you with a

South African experience, but not so South.

African that you get freaked out and don’t want
to come back. Thus the Zulus in Converses.

In the end, it comes down to the difference
between tourist and traveler, and ‘this time
around in South Africa, I played the part of the
formerwell. I did everything I was supposed to.
I hiked, biked, tasted wine and spent plenty of
money on food and handicrafts. I felt comfort-

able and safe the whole ,time, and, by all
accounts, I should go home and tell all my‘

friends that Cape Town is paradise. Which it is
—- if you’re only there for a visit. I i I

But it would be difficult to ignore the pushi-
ness I sensed in Cape Town, the over-eagerness
to appease the tourist population and the feeling
that the true culture was completely off—limits to
me. It made me wish I had more time in Cape

Town, so that I might better avert those discom-

forting advances:
When I ran into Nur on my last day in the

city, I offered to take him out to lunch, as long as

he would choose the restaurant. He drove us to a

quiet corner of central Cape Town, far from the '

busy streets hounded by tourists and "pushy local
peddlers. There in Bo-Kaap, an old Muslim
neighborhood, we ate traditional Malay food
with our hands and talked about our lives. To my
surprise, Nur is only 25, though he carries the

responsibilities of a man much older with such ..

grace and ease that_I had pegged him at 30, at
least. We exchanged phone numbers and e-mail
addresses, and I saw genuine interest in his eyes
as he asked when I would be returning to South
Africa.

It was the first time in a while I felt like a
traveler, not a tourist. ' '

Harvard easing tuition for poor students

Harvard University, one of the
most elite and wealthy universities
in the world, has adopted a policy
that will help low-income students
attend.

Harvard figures student aid
packages — disbursed out of their
staggering $19.3 billion endowment
—— based on what the student and the
parent can contribute, which is cal-
culated using their incomes. Parents
earning less than $40,000 will no
longer be asked to contribute to a
student’s $44,000 yearly bill, and
parents earning between $40,000
and $60,000 will have their share of
the tuition reduced as well.

As it stands now, parents in the
under-$40,000 group are expected to
contribute an average of $2,300. In
the fall, they won’t be asked to con-
tribute at all. Students will still be
expected to contribute by working
during summers and school years.

Currently, only 10 percent of the
students in elite colleges are from
the lower half of the economic spec-
trum, according to Harvard
President Lawrence H. Summers.

Diversity is a hot-button issue in
universities today, and while racial
and ethnic diversity are important,
they are not the only sort of diversi-
ty worth striving for. Students from
different socioeconomic back-
grounds have a lot to teach one

another. It’s entirely possible to
knock on three different stately
doors of mansions in a wealthy sub-
division and have three different-
colored faces answer, but those three
ethnically diverse families have

very similar lifestyles and experi-.

ences.

If rich kids are the only ones
who can afford to go to Harvard, it’s
likely they’ll choose to associate
with wealthy people. their entire
lives; after all, that’s who they spent
their formative years with. Harvard
has a reputation for being an enclave

‘of wealth and privilege, a place that

reinforces the stereotype of the rich
getting richer and the poor staying
poor. Attitudes like that tend to be
self—perpetuating, so it’s refreshing
to see Harvard take proactive steps
toward correcting that.

The Harvard name is a huge ben-
efit in life, far past the collegiate
years. An underwater basket weav-
ing major from Harvard may be just
as unemployed as an underwater
basket weaving major from East
Nowhere Community College, but
the Harvard weaver will probably
have a better chance of finding
work. It’s good to see Harvard loan-
ing its name to thecause of social
mobility.

Harvard’s only mistake in this
matter was not doing it sooner.

Getting her number was only the start

Last Saturday night, If found

myself at a party conversing with a 4

girl I didn’t know for -the first time
in my new era of. singleness. And,
miracle of miracles, it went very
well and I got her phone number.
Next, I was faced with an entirely
different quandary. How long do I
wait before calling her?

This is the first of what I’m sure A

are numerous conundrums
that I’ll be encountering
as a freshly single person
new to the college dating
world. I didn’t think it
should be too terribly
hard, and for a solution to
my question, I first tried
to think back to how I
dealt with it the last time
it faced me. That would
have been back in high
school, which means I’ve
likely ' already blocked it
out of my conscious,
retrievable memory. If it had gone
well, I’d definitely remember it.
Chances are I called too early. , '
A female friend, when asked for
advice, told me to call her the very
next day. No way in hell.‘I may be a
rookie, but even I know to lay off
the proverbial 3-0 pitch and not call
the day after. I’d come off as desper-
ate and stalker—ish, neither of which

are good qualities — or so I’m told. ‘

A male ‘friend told me to wait
two days before calling; that would
send the message that I’m interest-
ed, but not desperate. I asked if

three days would be even more

appropriate, but he said that three
days would be too long,-and I’d look
uninterested.

At this point, I feel like I’m
reenacting scenes from “Swingers.”
If this keeps up, -come i 2 a.m.
Saturday, you’ll likely find me sit-

\“Two days is protocol,” my
friend said.

Protocol?

I’m sorry, but any situation‘ in
which the word’ “protocol” is
involved should have written rules
or be taught at a finishing school

Something here just

beside the point. I can’t
change the system, so
for now I just have to
play by the complicated-, unwritten
rules that, for reasons beyond my
understanding, many people think
are normal. So, it’s back to the tech-
nicalities of the issue. _

How do I measure two days? Is
it two days from the evening I got
her number? Is it two days begin-
ning the day after the evening I got
her number? Since it_ was after mid-
night that I acquired the digits, does
that count as Saturday or Sunday?
Where does the counting start?

My friend, obviously terrified at
the turn my train of logic had taken,
told me to shut up and call her

out of the loop as far as this stuff is
concerned, but I wondered why he

Pitt’s excellent environmental record

This letter responds to “Pitt wasting
its potential,” by Andy Satchwell and
Clare Sierawski, The Pitt News, Feb.
20. Last year my staff and I met with a
representative . from Community
Energy (the ‘local representative for
New Wind Energy Inc.), and we found
out the following:

The cost of wind energy promoted
by NWE is 25 percent higher than the
cost of regular electricity. If‘ Pitt were to

I buy 5 percent of the electricity we con-
sume from NWE, it would cost us an
additional $ 200,000 a year ——equiva—
lent to the tuition from 23 students.

' NWE is a for-proﬁt company that
is promoting the sale of wind energy
mainly to universities in exchange for a
well—orchestrated media campaign to
categorize them as “environmentally
friendly” institutions.

About 60 percent of the fee
charged by NWE would go to Exelon,
a for-proﬁt electricity company that is
by far the _.nation’s largest generator of.
electricity from nuclear power plants.

Facilities Management believes
that developing “clean” sources of
energy is a very worthwhile concept,
but as a nonproﬁt organization, the
University shouldn’t be losing money
to promote a for-proﬁt nuclear power
provider.

In the last seven years, the
University of Pittsburgh has moved
very aggressively to adopt sustainable
practices; among other things, Pitt:

Now that emo, as a musical gem and cultural phe— »

nomenon, has oﬂicially wept its way into the mainstream,
who will protect its ancient rites and customs? While mod-
em—ro‘ck radio stations and MTV ﬁnally have a place in their
programming — and their hearts? —- for whiney kids with
broken hearts and three—chord guitar progressions to show
off, it seems as though underground emo resembles itself
less and less. ‘

Maybe these kids just got bored with channeling Sunny
Day Real Estate and J awbreaker. Or maybe they just worked
at their mundane jobs for long enough to afford nifty effects
pedals and studio time.

Either way, intriguing aberrations are to be found under
the radar. Now It’s Overhead, an Athens, Ga quartet fronted
by sound engineer/producer Andy LeMaster, is an example.
They would sound like straight-ahead acoustic guitar rock if
it weren’t for their penchant for digitally tweaked beats, bot-
tom-of-the-well echoes and angelic dream-pop vocals.

LeMaster is indeed the songwriting mastermind behind
Now It’s Overhead, but the group bonows the services of
Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor of the indie-pop group Azure
Ray, whose occasional vocal touches add texture to
Lemaster’s nasal, melodic yelp. On their second full—length
album, Fall Back Open, Now It’s Overhead offers a dense
collection of dark pop/rock, in the vein of Galaxie 500 and

REM. In fact, Michael
Stipe even drops in for a

sings on one of Fall Back

It’s no . coincidence,

Final Fantasy X’s latest edition has sex appeal  

Final Fantasy X-2
Square Enix

Sony PlayStation 2
79:32:72:

I will admit that the hype lead-
ing up to this game confused the
heck out of me. Yuna, the simple-
and—clean girl from “Final Fantasy
X,” suddenly cut her dress short,
started a singing career and learned
to wield guns? The genre jump baf-
fled new—school and old—school
gamers alike.

Then I played it.

This game defiles everything I
have ever held sacred. It reduces the
cast of playable characters to a scant
three — the smallest ever in a “Final
Fantasy” game, its implementation
of the Job System involves using
magical-girl ' transformation
sequences to change dresses mid-
battle, and it serves as an actual
sequel to its predecessor. In gaming
terms, these transgressions stop just
short of role-playing genocide.

But I forgive it on grounds of
incredible beauty.‘Who says justice
is blind?

Shortly after the end of “Final
Fantasy X,” we find Yuna as a mem-
ber of the Gullwings, a gang of
sphere-hunters that "could easily be

mistaken for Charlie’s Angels. They j

travel all over the world, searching
for treasure, meeting old friends and

getting mired in the political tensions

following the breakup of the all-
encompassing Yevon religion.
Along the way, they find evidence
of “you-know-who” — since you

could rename Tidus in “FFX,” they

that contraption

can’t refer to him by name in this
game — which spurs their desire to
learn about what’s going on behind
the scenes.

Ifl were to resort to using femi-
nine, flowery metaphor in explain-
ing this feminine, flowery game, I
would describe it as a bumblebee in
flight. .

Looking at it, you’d never think
that it works. The graphics are
mostly carry—overs from “FFX,” the
completely mission-based gameplay
is a glaring devi-
ation from the
classic “Final
Fantasy” model,
there are some
aspects of jump-
ing and climbing
around that seem
rather strangely
implemented yet
it works, as
though support-

ed by some .
unknown con‘-
trapﬁon.

We’ll call

“sex appeal” and
just be done with
it. H o n e s t 1 y
speaking, “Final

Fantasy .X-2”
has two things
going for it —

the plot and the
gameplay. While
the latter is rea-
son, enough to
play the game,
you won't get
the most out of it

unless — or until — you’ve finished
its precursor.

This game doesn’t spend very
much time explaining the returning
cast of characters and many of the
locales remain unchanged, so con-
sider picking up a copy of “Final
Fantasy X” if‘ you haven’t already
— it’s a “Greatest Hits” title that
can be found for $20’pretty much
anywhere.

I’m going to spare you the part
of the review where I burst into

song and just start shakin’ it all over
the place, as I feel that the ladies of
“FFX—2” do it far better than I ever
could.

If you can make it through this
lengthy RPG experience without A
drooling all _over your controller,
you’ll have nothing to worry about

«while playing.

Otherwise, I suggest you stock‘
up on controllers.

Mellow band Dolorean quietly storms intoPittsburgh

Since the 2003 release of its first full—length
album Not Exotic, the style of the Portland, Ore.-
based band Dolorean has been compared to the
late Elliott Smith by such publications as The

New York Times. According to a review in the’

Rolling Stone, the album “wallows in rich
melodies rooted in traditional American music.”
This is no surprise, since the down—to-earth
strumming of the acoustic guitar and mellow
vocals of lead singer Alex James embody a spir-
it reminiscent of many indie—rock songwriters.
This spirit defines the band’s debut album, which

goes from the sleepy cello music of
“Morningwatch” to the creepily sad “Hannibal,
Mo.,” a song about a double—suicide attempt
gone wrong. '

Dolorean was first formed by guitarist Alex
James and keyboardist Jay Clarkepin 1999 when
the two recorded the unreleased EP Sudden Oak.
In 2001, after a few years of playing Portland’s
club scene, the pair added drummer Ben Nugent
and bassist James Adair to the band and decided
it was time to record a serious album. The band
set up in Jackpot! Studios and recorded for a

mere five days, just enough time to accumulate
the nine deeply personal tracks on Not Exotic.“

’ This melancholy music is perfect for any fan
of such musicians as Smith, Neil Young or Wilco.
The band is now on a nationwide tour and plans
on "recording a-second album in the fall of A2004.

Dolorean brings its heartfelt music to Pittsburgh
with a stop at the Quiet Storm on Thursday. For
more‘ information, call (412) 661-9355.

during a meet earlier this season. Pitt; beat

MATT GRUBBA
Staff Writer

On Feb. 18, 1984, Ronald Reagan
was a first term president, Janet Jackson

Strokes,” and Pitt football was still try-
ing to get over the loss of Dan Marino.

That day was also the only time Pit/t
had ever beaten Penn State in women’s
gymnastics — until last Saturday.

Just a hair more than 20 years later,
the Pitt gymnastics team dug deep to
muster a senior night performance for
the ages, compiling the highest score in
team history en route to a 196.35-

Nittany Lions. The previous team high
for the Panthers was 195.925, scored on
Mar. 4, 2000. .- ,

After a near-perfect ﬂoor exercise
by Alyse Zefﬁro — one that turned out
to be her fourth 9.95 of the season on
ﬂoor — a jubilant Pitt team (8-4-1)
mobbed Zeffiro on the ﬂoor, not to con-
gratulate her on her stellar performance,
but rather to savor the upset of ranked
Penn State squad (6-4-1) as a team.

“I just gave it my all,’.’ a teary-eyed
Zeffiro said of her routine, which
brought much. .of the standing-room-

was keeping clothed on “Diff’renti

195.80 win over the No. 21-ranked]

only crowd at Fitzgerald Field House to
its feet, “but in my heart, I felt it was a
10.” ’ 5

And Zeffiro wasn’t the only one

_ who felt that way afterward.

“That should’ve been a 10, it was a
10 to me, and if we’re anywhere else, at
Michigan State, at West Virginia or at
Towson, that probably gets a 10, but
you know what, it wasn’t a perfect rou-
tine, [but] it was the perfect routine for
this night,” an equally teary-eyed head

coach Debbie Yohman said after the

match. Zeffiro’s floor performance
seemed to be inspired by a bit of one-
upmanship, as teammate Erika
Goldberg‘, performing immediately

before in the penultimate routine of the ‘

meet, had just become the ﬁrst Pitt
gyrrmast other than Zeffiro to score a
school-record ‘tying 9.95 on ﬂoor.

“I knew I had a good routine,”
Goldberg said, who was visibly grin-
ning after her first pass. “But I still had
that last pass, so I needed to keep.
focused.” “

On this night of records, Diandra
O’Connor followed suit when she regis-
tered a career-high. score in the all-
around competition with a 39.25, the
ﬁfth best individual score in school his-

mnasts set records in upset win

tory.

But when asked about her personal
record, O’Connor simply‘ said, “Every
week I try to hit on my routines, but
I’ve got no control over the scores.”

_As for the team” competition, the
final rotation on the floor yielded a
school-record shattering 49.425 —

A beating the old mark of 49.0 by nearly a

half a point. The overall score was in
Pitt’s favor from the first rotation, when
the Panthers recorded a 49.0 on vault,
led by a jubilant April Pearson, who tied
a personal best with a 9.85.

At the same time, the Lions fell

, apart early, with [falls on the uneven

bars, first by Stephanie Sullivan, fol-
lowed by a thunderous crash into the
ground by Lisa Clark, who, at 5’7”,
stands like a tower by gymnastics stan-
dards. Clark would redeem herself with
two 9.9 scores later, but her fall on the
bars caused Sullivan’s 9.175 to enter
into Penn State’s team score, providing
Pitt with its eventual margin of victory.
“It’s really indescribable, but this
shouldn’t be unexpected,” said Yohman
on the victory and record performance.
“We knew we had it in us, but it takes a
lot of courage to move up to the next
level, and we ﬁnally did tonight.”

Penn State for the first time in 20 years.

By her nature, LaToya Kincaid is quiet and low-key,
but on the basketball court she is a completely diiferent

person.

“I don’t have that much to say about things,” Kincaid
said. “I just get down to the point.”
Despite her tacitum nature, playing on a team with

Kincaid, 22, is almost like having a second ‘mother. Pitt ‘

head coach Agnus Berenato describes Kincaid as her secu-

rity blanket because of her willingness to take responsibil-

ity for the.team.' She is the type of player that is called upon
when Berenato needs something to be done. ‘

‘‘She’s very quiet and reserved, but at the same time
she is gentle, mothering anel’nurturing to the rest of her
teammates,” Berenato said. “She’s deﬁnitely like the mom
on the team, but she’s not as quiet and introverted as I once
thought. You can always call her number.” ,

Kincaid, a 6.-foot-1-inch senior forward, is the
youngest of  children and one rnightthink that it is
odd for the baby of the family to be a natural caretaker. As
the youngest child, Kincaid always had somebody watch-

ing over her, but ‘she says that she had responsibilities
-1 around the house and attributes her sense of responsibility

to the way she was raised.
1 Kincaid said that, growing up, she always had a matu-

rity about her. It has carried over onto the basketball court

" This season Kincaid has emergedvas the_team’s leading

scorer as she averages 14.8 points to go along with her 7.4
rebounds per game. A

“I’ve been like that [the leader] with other teams too.
That’s just how I am,” Kincaid said. “I have always been
the mature type With all the athletes that I have played
with.

The Panthers hit a bump in the road after the Jan. 14
victory over Seton Hall, as Pitt has been on an 11 game los-
ing streak ever since. Things came to a head after Pitt’s
contest at Connecticut back on Feb. 17, and as a mother
will do when things are not going right, Kincaid took a lot
of responsibility for the Panthers’ 97-42 loss to UConn.

“[I admire] her willingness to take responsibility,”
Berenato said. “[In] the UConn game we lost by a lot of
points and she said she should have been able to do more.”

Kincaid contributed only six points —e which tied her
season low — and four rebounds. After the game she felt
like she could have given a better effort. ’

“I could have done more, offensively and defensive-
ly,” Kincaid said. “I have to keep them in line and try to be
there [for my teammates] when they need me.”

What is perhaps even more intriguing about ﬂie dif-
ferences between Kincaid on and off the basketball court
is that she comes from a small town the small southern of
West Helena, Ark. She describes West Helena as a town

that has hardly any traffic and is not busy. Her family was
always outside doing some type of activity because there

was so much room. Moving to Pittsburgh was a bit of a 0

transition for her, as she prefers a smaller, town setting.

“I like the souﬂi better. It [Pittsburgh] is busy com-
paredito where I’m from,” Kincaid said. “[The South] -is
where I’m from and it’s not busy. It’s too many people
here.”

Despite preferring a smaller environment, Kincaid
was intrigued with testing out life in the city. So_ when Pitt
recruited her, Kincaid saw it as an opportunity to play for
a major conference and experience city life. Kincaid trans-
ferred from Pensacola Junior College in 2002 after two
seasons with the team, and is only in her second year with
Pitt. '

“I had different options, but I wanted to come to the
city and check it out to get a different view of things,”
Kincaid said. ‘The city life [inﬂuenced my
decision] and [Pitt] is in the Big East [C/onference. I want-
ed to play for a major conference.” -

, Other than adjusting to life in the city, Kincaid had to
adjust to a new head coach because Traci Waites was ﬁred
after last season, which was Kincaid’s ﬁrst with the
Panthers. Berenato replaced Waites as the head coach of

Panthers drop llth straig

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

As the story has gone all year, the
Pitt women’s basketball team had trou-
ble shooting the ball against Virginia
Tech on Saturday at the Cassell
Coliseum.

On the other side, the Hokies Shot a
season—high 63.8 percent from the ﬂoor.
It was also a school record for shooting
percentage against a Big East opponent
and on this day, it propelled them past
the Panthers in blowout fashion, 85-55.

The Panthers scored the ﬁrst bucket
when forward LaToya Kincaid hit a
jump shot. Pitt kept the game close for
the first six minutes, with more strong
play from Kincaid. She hit a free throw,
Scored two buckets and assisted on
another to make the score 11-11, with
14:02 left in the first half.

But it was all Virginia Tech from
then on.

Virginia Tech went on a 16-3 run,
led by Davina Simmons, who scored
three consecutive layups for the Hokies.
The Hokies at one point extended their
lead to 17 points in the ﬁrst half.

“We missed a lot of shots,” Pitt head
coach Agnus Berenato said. ‘They con-
veited blocked shots into scores.”

The Panthers cut the lead at the half
to 10 points at 41-31, but out of the lock-
er room, Virginia Tech went on a 20-5

run. It gave the Hokies a 25-point lead
with 11:57 remaining in the game.

Virginia Tech kept control of the
game and rolled on to win by 30 points.

Every player that played in the game
for Virginia Tech scored at least one ﬁeld
goal. The Hokies had four players scor-
ing in the doub1e—digits. Starting guard
Carrie Mason led Virginia Tech with 14
points. She was perfect from the floor,
hitting all six of her field goal attempts,
including a pair of three-pointers.

The Hokies also dominated on the
boards, pulling down 39 rebounds, as
compared to the Panthers’ 28 rebounds.

Berenato explained that they were
out-rebounded due to the fact the
Panthers were outsized by the Hokies.
This led to the 48 Virginia Tech points in
the paint. Pitt only managed 20 points
from that part of the court. 1

Virginia Tech forward Ieva Kublina
led the way for the Hokies controlling
nine rebounds. She also ﬁnished the
game with 10 points.

For the Panthers, guard Katie Histed
was a bright spot in the lineup. She
scored a game-high 16 points, including
two three-pointers. She also came up
with three steals in her 33 minutes of
action.

“She’s been coming along strong,”
Berenato said. “She’s picking up the sys-
tem.”

one.

“It was easy to adjust because [coach
Berenato] is a very open coach,” Kincaid
said. “Things happen and I feel that you

have to keep going and do your best with

the one that comes in.”
As a high school student, Kincaid

‘played volleyball and softball, along with‘

basketball. She says. she excelled in all
three sports, but the fact that she has always
loved basketball inﬂuenced her decision to
continue playing on the collegiate level.
During her free time, Kincaid enjoys

singing and playing spades. Spades

growing up, she played with her family
and friends. She enjoys a variety of music,
but has never considered singing profes-

Kincaid hopes to play basketball over-

seas next season and hopefully catch the
eye of a WNBA team. She is a public
administration major and hopes to own her
own recreation center, along with helping
others to become better people. _

According to Kincaid, her .mother,
Deloris Holloway, deserves most of the
credit for the woman-that her daughter has
become. Kincaid’s mom taught her to
never give up and to go for the things that
she wants in life. She credits her mom for
giving “her the inspiration to be able to suc-

“If it was not for my mom I would not
be here today,” I Kincaid said. “She has
inspired me throughout my life.”

— Kincaid will play‘ in her ﬁnal game at
the Petersen Events Center, tonight at 7
p.m. as the Panthers take on Villanova. She
is appreciative of the time she has spent at
Pitt and the people who she has interacted
with. .

“I want everybody to play together

and focused,” Kincaid said. “I want my

coaches and teammates to know how
much I appreciate ﬂiem. I want to thank
them for being there for mef’ '_
