have been responsible for the book
and lyrics for several recent pro-

_The ninth floor of the Cathedral
of Learning is being made ready
for classrooms with the opening of
the second semester.. Four addi-
tional classrooms are also being
finished on the eighth floor of the
new building.

It is planned to move all zoology

which a.re now being occupied by
those departments on Frick Acres
will be dismantled.

With the removal of the zoology
classes to the Cathedral, more than
1000 students will have one or more
classes in that building. The Ca-

room purposes last February when
several drawing classes of the

Stone work on the building has
been temporarily halted during the
winter months, but will be resumed
in early «spring, according to an an-

Coeds to Cut
”RushingCojst

Panhel Urges Economy In
Coming Season

“Originality instead of elaborate-
ness will be the neyno-te of woman’s
fraternity rushing this year,” ex-
plained Mildred Levenson, Col. ’32,
president of Panhellenid.

Panhellenie has concentrated all
year on reducing the cost of rush-
ing, which, last year, was the great,-
est that it has ever been. The first
step toward this was the elimina-
tion of fall rushing and the substi-
tution of a bid day.

A few weeks ago the council
voted to eliminate men from their
rushing parties. This step was tak-
en to eliminate dances with the ex-
pense of an orchestra and a dance
floor. ’ _

At the meeting of Panhellenic
last night, the prospects of cutting
down rushing expenses by planning
a very simple program to which all
the fraternities were to adher
were discussed.

“Free association should have
made it possible by this time for
fraternity women to be acquainted
with most of the freshmen girls.
There is no need for giving such
expensive parties at any time, and
especially in the present depression
I feel that it is sensible to cut .down
as much as possible}! says Mary
Jane Brankstone, Col. ’32, chairman
of rushing rules.

“It seems to me that the great-
est success in a rushing season can
be gained when the fraternities en-
tertain their prospective members
in the same manner that they carry
out the rest of their social events
during the year. The freshmen will
probably-be more impressed by the
economy of the fraternities than by
their extravagance this year," is
the opinion of Harriet Davies, Ed.
’32, secretary of Panhellenic.

Interfraternity council at
monthly meeting last Tuesday
night voted that each fraternity
will be responsible for the sale of
eight tickets to the Interfraternity
Ball, to~be held February 26, at
either the Schenley or the William
Penn. The act was taken to guaran-
tee representation from all frater-
nities on campus.

A rule in Council's constitution
states that in case any Interfrater-
nity Ball is not a. financial success
each fraternity will be held respon-
sible for the cost of fifteen tickets.

Chairmanship, Upholds
Farcical Regulations

 

 

Chosen from a group of twenty-
one petitioning candidates, an un-
precedented number in the social
history» of the University, Donald
Campbell, C01,, was selected chair-
man of the Freshman dance com-
mittee at a meeting of -Student
Council Wednesday afternoon. The
forthcoming affair, being given Fri-
day evening, February 12, will be
the second annual dance of its
kind.

The ever-recurring question of
what to do about freshman regula-
tions made its appearance at Wed-
nesday’s meeting of Council and in
a flurry of ballotting, was settled
when a motion to discontinue all
freshman regulations was defeated
by a majority of one vote.

Fresh Rules Trouble _

Three ballots were required to
decide the majority opinion; the
first, a miscount, was followed by
a tie, which in turn, was broken. by
the appearance of another council
member. In the third ballot, repre-
sentative Paul Best's motion to
banish forever the skeleton in the
councilmanic closet was defeated
by a vote of seven to six.

Members who voted to continue
regulations offered no plan to sup-
plant the existing system, which all
agreed had been a complete failure

~ this year.

Robert Beck, Col. ’33, chairman
of the present Frosh Customs com-
mittee, pointed out that the failure
of freshman regulations was a re-
sult of the disinterested attitude of
upper classmen. He said:

“The majority of upper classmen
don’t attempt to enforce regula-
tions. Freshmen can’t be‘ expected
to wear their dinks and observe
.reg.ula-tions. -when their -upper. class-
men friends tell them it isn’t nec-
essary.”

. Rose Gives Report

Reed Rose, Dent. ’32, chairman of
investigations committee, reported
he had learned from John Dambach
head of the department of physical
education, that since stories and
editorials concerning thievery in
the men’s locker room of Trees
Gym appeared in the Pitt Weekly
nothing has been discovered miss-
ing by the students. At the request
of the students, valuables now may
be placed in a steel cabinet to as-
sure their safety. Students must
provide their own locks for the
individual lockers. V

Campbell, the choice of Council

pledged to Theta Delta Psi, local
social fraternity, and is a staff
member of the Pitt Weekly.

Twenty other candidates were
considered in the selection of the
chairman; they were J. D. Allen,

Harold Foringer, Wilson Ginn,

Professor W. M. Parrish, coach of

February 15.

The University of Pennsylvania
debaters will oppose the Pitt team
in a debate at East Liberty Y. M.

ject of centralized, control of in-

will defend the negative side of
the question, the same view they

are required. A pamphlet, “Regula-
tions and Requirements for Higher
Degrees in Education,” now being
printed, to be issued, by the ﬁrst
of February, states “That each of
the two degrees should represent
scholarship of high order is un-
questioned. The two degrees are
similar in their requirements for
scholarship; they may be differen-
tiated in the nature of the contri-
butions through research which
candidates are required to make.”

The degree of doctor of educa-
tion “stands for the ability to or-
ganize materials and to test edu-
cational theory and practice
through application to actual school
situations. Research for this degree
is of a service type.”

An applicant for the degree of
doctor of education may meet cer-
tification requirements by any two
of the following subjects: French,
German, statistics and mental
measurements; together with either
a thesis prepared for a’master’s
degree, or a formal paper describ-
ing some problem of school prac-
tice for which he has been chiefly
responsible for a period of three
years preceding the examination.

This paper must be approved by ~-

the major professor.

The degree of doctor of educa-
tion is available to those now work-
ing for a doctorate of philosophy
in education.

The University now offers in ed-
ucation the degree-s of master of
arts, master of education, doctor of
philosophy and doctor of education.

Guilty?

Mayberry to Analyze
Criminal Liars in

Seminar Talk

Can you look a person in the
eye and tell a lie? Yes, per-
haps, but can you tell a lie
and at the same time keep
your heart from beating fast-
er or your blood pressure from
changing? '

Psychologists claim you
can’t and they have devised
apparatus with which to
change the oftenalleged police
department “third de gree”
from a brow-beating session to
a cool analysis of testimony.

At a meeting of the Social
Science Seminar this afternoon
Howard R. Mayberry, assist-
ant professor of psychology,
will discuss methods of detect-
ing guilt in criminals.

Referring to his forthcoming
talk, Mr. Mayberry said, “It
will be an analysis of guilt de-
tection from Adam ‘on down,’
dealing principally with de-
velopments in mgelchanical
means of detecting lies.”

The Seminar will be held in
the Faculty Club rooms in the
Hotel Schenley, at 1 o'clock.
The address will follow the
regular Seminar luncheon
which begins at 12:30 o'clock.

 

Among the latest additions to
the University library are several
reports by the School of Business
Administration; “Business Barome-

ters for the Pittsburgh District”
and “Changes in Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Conditions.”

Unemployment and economics
are freely discussed in E. C. Bueh-
ler’s volume, “Compulsory Unem-
ployment Insurance,” and in the
“Introduction to Economic “History,”
by N. S. B. Gras. J. K. \Vink1er,
author of the much criticized “In-
credible Carnegie,” offers a study

icent.”

Curtains in “Y” Office
Cause Stir Among
He-Ma-n Members

The Y. M. C. A. office has
gone effeminate. Maroon or-
ange and brown curtains adorn
the erstwhile bare windows.
These greeted the boys when ,
they. returned from Christmas
vacation, who thought they
were in the Y. W., office, In
addition, Mr. Mendenhall has
provided picture frames for
his inner office.

Although several of the boys
have been blamed, Mrs. Guthrie
is carrying a peculiar smile.
Help sister will probably be
called upon to furnish another
color scheme should the boys‘
decide to go in for souvenirs.

Open Season Thursday
With Hi Mittmen

The Pitt freshman boxing team
will journey to Freedom, Pa., next
Thursday to meet the high school
team of that place.

Thellrneet will be the first this
year in which a University boxing
team will take part and will mark
the beginning of Pitt’s first sea-
son of extensive participation in
the collegiate ring.

The frosh squad is almost entire-
ly composed of green men with
little, or no experience. and sev-
eral of the members of the team
will be getting their first taste.

of outside competition _Thursday.
Zaiden, 125 Poundcr

Richard Zaiden will represent
the freshmen in the 125 pound
class. Zaiden has had previous
amateur experience and handles
himself well. The 135 pound Pitt
representative is still; undecided
with both Bernie Spiegel and Dal
Maddelon still in the running.
Bus Mawhinney seems the likely
145 pound fighter while Ed Thomp-
son, of West Philadelphia, Pa.,
who recently participated in the
University championships will be
the heavyweight.

While the Freshmen open their
season Thursday, the varsity team
remains in practice for its first
meet with West Virginia, three
weeks away. Joe Orsini has been
driving the squad hard in an effort
to polish off the rough qualities
of the boys. Most of the members
of the squad are raw and .inexperi-
enced and need plenty of train-
ing and competition and more
time for practice than remains.

Love Heavyweight

There is a scarcity of heavy-
weights and light heavyweights.
John Love, at present, seems the
most likely heavy. Love, a foot-
ball player and a good one, is
heavy and powerful, In the light
heavyweight class, Tom Milligin,
sprint man on the track team, is
outstanding. Norman McCormick
will probably box for Pitt in the
115 pound class.

All three of the above men are
new without any competitive ex-
perience. Orsini holds hopes for
them and is working them hard,
but they need practice and they
need coaching. Orsini is packing
in as much practice and coaching
as possible in a limited period, but
time is growing short.

Henry Martin and Marius Santi-
cola are once again boxing in the
145 and 135 pound classes respect-
ively. Last year these boys boxed
at these weights for the varsity,
but this year Orsini switched
them. Now they are back in the
old classes again.

By the scribbling Panther

ilegiate sport that almost any indi-
vidual you meet in the street,
whether he be a graduate of Yale,
N. Y. U., Michigan, Southern
California, or just Osh-wash
-grade school can tell you what
schools are supreme in their sec-
tions of the country, who has had
‘the best record of any school in
the country for the past number
of years, who are the greatest
players of all times. etc., etc.

During the past few years anoth-
er sport has come to the fore
among colleges of our country and
now receives almost as much pub-
licity in the student papers as
football. This sport is basketball.
Crowds at basketball games are
limited to such an extent that it
is hardly likely that the game will
ever come close to its predecessor
football, in drawing power. But
the skill, speed, intelligence and
perfect condition demanded of
those who play the game entitles
it to assume its rank among the
outstanding sports provided for
the amusement of the other mem-
bers of the student body.

Gain Hold on Public

During the past four years, Pitt
hasxattained such a position in
basketball, that its teams in this
sport are as great attractions on
foreign fields as are Jock Suther-
land’s football teams. The trip to
the coast this year evidently
shows the hold which basketball
and the Pitt team in particular,
has upon the sporting gentry of
the country.

Pitt did not always have great
basketball teams. Back in the
season of 1915-1916, Pitt had its
first championship team. That
team won 15 of its 17 -games. But
after that season, championship
cage teams on the Pitt campus
were rather rare with the result
that interest in the sport was
gradually waning.

Beginning in the winter of 1927
with John McMahan, Sykes Reed
and Stash Wrobleski, all seniors,
and Charley Hyatt and Paul Zeb-
fuss, sophomores, forming the reg-
ular lineup, the Pitt five made a
journey through the west and de-
feated Michigan, Chicago, North-
western» and Iowa within a period
of five days. The team came home
and went through its season with
a perfect record. The team the
following season won 16 games out
of 21 played. The next season found
Pitt winning 23 and losing .2. Last
year's team won 20 while losing

Many fans have sung the prais-
es of the Pitt team and have con-
sidered it one of the outstanding
teams in the country. Others more
curious, like the writer, have want-
ed to know what team has the
best record of any in the coun-
try. And what a difficult task it
is to find out.

Montana Champs '5

Back in 1927-1928 when Pitt had
its undefeated team, Montana
State was winning its second
straight Rocky Mountain Confer-
ence. State won 35 games that
year while losing 2. Its defeats
were administered by Idaho U., and
Utah State but the former team
was trounced thrice and the lat-
ter team twice by the Conference
champions. In 29 of the games that
season, Montana scored more
than 40 poinlts, which in itself
averages a point a. minute, The

Sixteen Teams Enroll

 

Sixteen teams have enrolled in
the Independent Basketball League
which has been formed under the
supervision of Mr. Potts of the

Physical Education Department.
There are also prospects of sever-
al additional last minute members
including one from the military de-
partment_

As yet the schedule has not been
made up but the complete list of
games will be posted on the bulle-
tin boards in the gymnasium next
Monday, January 11. The initial
tilt will take place Tuesday night
January 12.

Three of the strongest teams in
the league are expected to be those
representing the Pharmacy, Den-
tistry and Engineering Depart-
ments.

Scason’s Dramatic Sensation, with

SYLVIA SIDNEY

That same season Butler com-
piled an enviable record, winning
19 and. losing 3. The» games were
lost to Wisconsin, Purdue, and
Notre Dame. The latter two teams
in return engage-
Butler scored 727 points
that season to its opponents 514.

Purdue, hailing from Indiana,
tied for the championship of the
Big 'l‘en that season. Its record for
the year showed 14 victories and
3 defeats. The defeats which it
suffered at the hands of Butler and
Indiana were revenged that same
season.

Further south, Arkansas and
North Carolina were outstanding.
The former copped its third suc-
cessive Southwest Confere n c e
championship with a record in
that group of 12 victories with
nary a defeat chalked up against
it. North Carolina was the out-
standing team in _the Southern
conference even though it was
eliminated in the opening round
of the annual tournament by
Louisiana State University. During
its regularly scheduled campaign,
the team won 16 games and lost
1. Tulane administered the lone de-
feat, but North Carolina copped
the other two games played be-
tween the teams.

Western crs Repeat

The following year found three
of these teams at the top of the
heap in their sections. Montana
State again won the Rocky Moun-
tain Conference. Its record for that
season also was 35 victories against
2 defeats. Cook's Painters, nation-
al A. A. U. champions won one of
these games by a four point marg-
in but it lost its other 2 tilts with
the collegians by 12 and 17 points
respectively. Utah State adminis-
tered the other defeat, but was
subdued 3 times by Montana dur-
ing the same season. In 34 of the
37 tilts found the champions scor-
ing at least 40 points, while in no
game did they fall below 31. They
scored 40 to 50 points in 9 games,
50 to 60 points in 8 games, 60 to
70 points in 9 games, 70 to 80 in 3
games and 99, 96, 90, 97 and 110 in
its other victories.. Throughout
the season, the team scored 1935
points against its opponents 1055.
It averaged 52 and 11-37 points per
game against 28 and 19-37.

Arkansas continued on its way
to another Southwest Conference
championship with 11 victories
against one defeat while Butler
was leading the W-est with 17 vic-

-tories in 19 starts. It revenged a

three point defeat at the hands of
Notre Dame by administering that
school a 19 point beating. Among
Butler's victims, other than sec-
tional ones were Pitt, North Caro-
lina and Missouri of the Big Six
conference.

In the East, little St. John’s Col-
lege» of Brooklyn occupied a spot-
light with a record of 23 victories
against 2 defeats. The record was
no ﬂash in the pan for that little
school produced cham p i o 11 ah i p
teams the following two seasons.
Its record in 1929-1930 showed 23
victories and 1 loss, while the fol-
lowing year's scoresheet credited
the Catholics with 21 triumphs in
22 games.

Arkansas Continues Streak

In the meantime several of the
other teams staged comebacks,
while Duke came to the horizon
as another powerful array. In 1929
-1930 Pitt lost but 2 games in 25
played. Arkansas again won the
Southwest Conference, this time
with a record of 10 victories
against 2 defeats. Purdue added

Opposes
Drastic Changes

Dr. Jock Sutherland, a delegate

to the football coaches’ convention
held recently at New York came
back with a statement to the ef-
fect that the rules will probably
be essentially the same for next
'year.

“To begin with,” he said, “there
nothing fundamentally wrong
ith the game. Most of the fatali-

ties which have raised such a fur-
or have taken place on ill-condi-
tioned teams. In fact, I can think
of only about two or three which
have occurred at big-time colleges.
One at Fordham and one at Army
have come in for the most publici-
ty. And on professional
deaths are just about unheard of.

“Of course several good sugges-

tions were made. Among them was
the one by ‘Pop’ Warne.r for‘Stan-

pads to protect the thigh, in place
of the metal plates hitherto in use.

“But to get back to these rule

changes on account of the fatalities

is my opinion that nine out of

Two years ago Pitt, led by Charley
Hyatt, traveled to Syracuse with
an unblemished record, but was
unexpectedly spilled, 40-29. Last
year, the Panthers gained revenge,
beating Syracuse. 31-28.

Fou-r New Regullars

There are four new faces on the
Orange ﬁve this year. Beagle and
Hayman, forwards, and Fogarty
and Katz, guards, star membersof
l-ast season’s team, have all gradu- ,
ated so that Captain Elliott, center
is the only veteran back. Never-
theless, Coach Andreas has built -a".
strong combination. Last week the
Orange handed University oi.’
Michigan its first defeat of the
year, 33-30.

Wednesday, Pitt faces the up- I

and-coming Duquesne University
five, opening relations with the Hill
school that will be extended to
every sport. Chick Davies, .Du_l_:o
coach, has always developed es-
pecially successful floor teams and
this year the Dukes are touted as

Customs Again !

 

HERE HAVE BEEN ru-
mors, and pretty well
founded rumors too, that Stu-
dent Council has a weakness
for politics. But until Wednes-
day night, there had been no
deﬁnite demonstration that the
inﬂuence of an overwhelming
~sentimentality was another
shortcoming of the legislative
body. '

Regulations are to be im-
posed upon men entering the
Freshman class at the opening
of the second semester. This,
Council, swathed in all the au- .
thority and dignity at its com-

’ mand, decided Wednesday
night, because Council is a re-
‘ actionary group, led on by the
bubble of tradition. Council
reasons that because there have
been regulations in the past,
and because every good college
romance devotes a chapter to

o e e u . no

this sort of activity, regulations
must be put into effect at Pitt.

What Council members would
probably be surprised to learn

‘is that regulations have always
been a. farce here because once
the order for their return‘ is
given, student legislators

. think that their job is done.
Enforcement is an unfamiliar
term in Pitt councilmanic cir-
cles.

Well, if Council is content
for the regulations to last a
. week or only for a day, and if
the freshmen don’t mind being
taxed to the extent of 90 cents
for a dink, we suppose it is al-
right. But somehow, we hope

that the glint of light will pene-
trate through the thick fog of
tradition that surrounds the
campus solons, and that they
, will learn that Pitt doe-sn’t
_want regulations and doesn’t
need them.

Outdoor Convocation

HERE WILL BE general
approval to the announce-
ment that the June convoca-
tion exercises will be held in
the Stadium.

The unfortunate situation
which found Syria Mosque too
small to accommodate all the
parents and near relatives of
the graduating students made
it necessary to develop new ar-
rangements. With convocation
in the Stadium, attendance will
be unlimited.

There is also much to be said
for an outdoor setting for this
rather auspicious event. On a,

_ clear June day under a blue
sky, the ceremony should be
-considerably more symbolic
than it has been when held
within the walls of a commer-
cial auditorium.

Since decision has been made
to hold commencement out-
doors, it might also be a wise
move to arrange an outdoor
ceremony for the annual Spring
tapping ceremonies of the hon-
orary organizations. It is un-
derstood that Mortar Board and
Omicron Delta Kappa have al-
ready given some considera-
tion to the advisability of this
plan.

With tapping held on the

campus instead of in the dark-
ened interior of Memorial -Hall,
where no one cares to go on a
nice Spring day, an interesting
and purposeful program attend-
ed by many more students
could be developed.

A” Mixture of Things Artistic

_ A Gladys Schmitt

’ We are expecting much from
the Chicago Symphony program, to
be given at the Syria Mosque on
Friday evening, January 18, with
Frederick Stock’ conducting. Mr.
Stock has always brought us fine
programs; his taste in the choice
and arrangement of numbers is un-
erring, and his playing is always
adequate, and if not sparkling,
solid, dependable and sincere. The
coming program is a comprehens-
ive and compact history of music
in itself: Bach's Passacaglia, Bee-
thoven’s Seventh Symphony, De-
bussey’s suite, La Mer, and Strav-
inski’s Fire-bird.

The Passacaglia is Bach’s great-
est instrumental composition. It
was written originally for organ;
.Mr. Stock is bringing it in his own
orchestral version. (We are a little
sorry that he did not spend his
arranging energies on one of the
other great organ works; the Pas-
sacaglia has been arranged a num-
.ber of times already.) For those
who have never heard it before,
the Passacaglia will be an import-
ant but difficult experience. It is
as inspired as it is involved, as
‘rich as it is perfect, hard to under-
stand but, once understood, con-
stantly valuable and everlastingly
‘new.’

Thefellowship was recently estab-

 

longs not to the heroic and
somewhat boisterous first part
of the period, but to a defi-
nite and important subdivision,
beginning with opus 70, or
thereabouts, in which good
taste, restraint, balance, and
gravity take the foreground. It
is at once restrained and hil-
arious, masterful and graceful,
heroic and resigned.

Debussey’s Suite, although
not so fine as the Nocturnes,
is good Debussey. It makes an
excellent number since it has
not been played in Pittsburgh
as often as the former; and
Mr. Stock, faithful always to
the letter and spirit of his
composer, promises us a fine
rendering,

II t It

The Fire-Bird is well known and
well received here. It is one of
Stravinski’s earlier works-early,
but not in the least immature. Of
that colorful, brilliant, intricate
style in which Stravinski excels,

it is a perfect example. Stravins-

ki has always shown a remarkable
understanding of his own powers.
Every effort of his has lain well
within his own limits and is there-
for thoroughly satisfying. He has
advanced much since he wrote the
Fire-Bird, has grown more elemen-

Printemps and more masterful and
various is the Symphony of
Psalms. But the Fire-Bird lacks
nothing and is interesting in spite
of its continued popularity.

So the dependable Mr. Stock
promises us good music, Classic,
Romantic, and Modern and an ex-
cellent evening.

Clothier Challenges Cwens, Druids To Support Ideals
of University

 

A challenge was hurled at the Owens and Druids at a joint
supper meeting of the two organizations Wednesday evening in
Heinz House. Robert C. Clothier, dean of men, who, together
with Dean of Women Thyrsa W. Amos, sponsored the event,
said that he believed that two such kindred organizations could,
if “they were brave enough and zealous enoug ,” stamp out
any practice which conﬂicted with the ideals of the University.

“For example, you young men¢

and women could, I believe, elimin-
ate such an obnoxious practice as
cheating during examinations,” the
dean of men told approximately 50
past and present Cwens and Druids.
Dinner First of Kind.

The gathering was the ﬁrst of
its type in the history of the Uni-
versity. Following the dinner,
John Grove, Col., and Dorothy
Wanner, Ed., presidents of Cwens
and Druids, outlined the history
and purposes of the organizations,
after which Deans Amos an-d Cloth-
ier spoke on trends in education.

Dean Amos mentioned three ma-
jor changes which are taking
place in education today: educa-
tion of the entire pepson (mentally
and physically), grovth of the
junior college idea, and closer con-
tacts between faculty and under-
graduate body.

Deans Give Talks.

The question of faculty student
contacts was touched upon by Dean
Amos and elaborated by Dean
Clothier. “Although the lack of
intimate relationship between fac-
ulty members and students may be
partially the fault of the faculty,”
said the dean of men, "I ask you
not to wait for their invitations.
Part of your education consists of
learning to know your instructors
as they really are out of the class-
room‘; take the initiative in mak-
ing their acquaintance.”

Editor, The Pitt Weekly,

Sir,

As a member of the student
body, I should like to say that
I was disappointed but far
from surprised at the results
of the disarmament poll. To
one who is familiar with the
usual type of Pitt student, it
is not at all surprising that
such an immature and unin-
telligent view should be shown
on what is, without a doubt,
one of the most important of
the many world issues on
which we, as university stud-
ents, should have an intelli-
gent opinion. However, it is
certainly disappointing, and
more especially so when we
realize that Dartmouth, Col-
gate, Yale, Mt. Holyoke,- and
Amherst all voted strongly in
favor of disarmament. Perhaps
they, and also Einstein, Lord
Cecil, and Sherwood Eddy, to
mention just a few who fav-
our disarmament, are wrong,
and we and William Randolph
Hearst and Arthur Brisbane
are right, but I doubt it. It
is not a matter of opinion,
but it is a matter of fact that
disarmament is the only way
to achieve a universal and last-
ing peace, and we, as members
of the college trained minori-
ty, are morally obligated to
recognize that fact.

I should like also to protest
against the weak-kneed atti-
tude on this question taken
by the Pitt Weekly, as shown
by your editorial of December
11th. Don't you, either, know
enough about it to be able to
discuss it intelligently, or are
you afraid that you might of-
fend someone by telling the
truth. If the former is the
reason, then allow me to rec-
ommend that you read Kirby
Page’s “National Defense”, or
“The Fight for Peace,” by De-
vere Allen. Even though your
intelligence be as limited as
your editorials invariably in-
dicate, you will not find either
book too hard to understand.
If the latter reason is the true
one, you are completely unfit
for your position, and should
immediately resign.

Yours,

H. R. Dammond.

W?LAGER JAILED
I'm ack after a harassing Christ-

mas vacation. I'm still a trifle slug-
gish at the heels, and I know my
complexion will never be the
same. To say nothing of my neu-
rasthenia. It all happened on De-
cember 24.

A friend was stumped; he
couldn't decide on a present for
his six year old cousin‘. “Don’t
worry, pal,” I assured him, “I’ll
go to town and get something you
cangive the kid.”

Going to town is a smart parlor
trick if you can do it, and who am
I to be daunted with friendship at
stake? Without stopping to think
I dashed madly to the trolley, and
within three hours and twenty
minutes I alighted at Smithfield
street.

I have a way about me of tang-
ling my eyes with the stickout ribs
of umbrellas. And it was raining!
Wandering blindly in the damp
blur, I closed my eyes tightly to
fool the partying umbrellas, and
plodded on and on. My plodding is
fine thank you. Suddenly whirrrrsh
something ripped past and neatly
snipped off my coat button. I open-
ed my eyes—-—l found that I was

ton street car tunnel! With a de-
ﬁant toss of my head, an artful lift-
ing of the brows, I kicked promiscu-
ously at a cigarette stump and
headed back to the department
store. All the while thinking of a
present for a six year old kid.

I had to wait in the revolving

door fully eight minutes until
a hussy came out. Swish -— she
was out; I was in; I shouldn’t
care to go around with her
anyway. Once inside, several
silly-willies besieged me, “May we
serve you?” The counter dripped
with those pink flimsies that make
you blush and call the Sunday school
teacher's attention to something
else. “No thanks,” I prettied, “I'm
merely er—er looking about.” I hid
my abashed face behind my sleeve
and skittered to the Toyland esca-
lator. Escalator—you know, steps
that flatten out when they get to
the top.
