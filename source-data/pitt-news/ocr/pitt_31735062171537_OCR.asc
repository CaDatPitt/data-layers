- SST Bill Embattled

by MARC HILLER

After many months in commit-
tee. the Supersonic Transport
(SST) Appropriations Bill is ex-
pected to be voted on today in the
United States Senate.

The SST is the proposed com-
mercial passenger plane that
would fly faster than two and one-
half times the speed of sound.

The Boeing Company is about to
start building a prototype SST im-
mediately upon funding. Presi-
dent .\'ixon is asking Congress for
$290 million in 1971 to subsi-
dize its construction.

The SST has stirred up contro-
versy ranging from Capitol Hill
to the local classroom.

Battle has loomed mostly be-
tween environmental groups and
the Federal Department of Trans-
portation 1DOT>. But now. the
true fate of the SST awaits signal
in the Senate.

The SST is a technical marvel
and certain money-maker as
claimed by its supporters. The
opposition pronounces the SST an
environmental disaster and socio-
ogical distortion that will deafen
whole cities. create irreversible
changes in the climate. and divert
badly-needed tax dollars from
pressing human needs in a time
of inflation.

The Coalition Against the SST.
an alliance of three dozen consum-
er and conservationist organiza-
tions, is attempting to beat the
contested $1.3 billion venture.

Prominent groups working in
this coalition are-the Audubon So-
ciety, Friends of the Earth, Si-
erra Club, Wilderness Society,

Environmental Action-Zero Pop-
ulation Growth, and the Citizen’s

~ League Against the SST.

SST BANNED IN CITIES

Some American cities have ban-
ned the SST from airspace and
others are talking about not per-
mitting the giant aircraft to land
within their city limits.

Recommendations to this ef-
fect were sent to Governor Ray-
mond Shafer on Oct. 10 by en-
vironmental organizations from
some 26 college campuses in
Pennsylvania. including Pitt.

According to the Citizens
League Against the Sonic Boom,
“Data on public reaction and
property damage from seven son-
ic boom tests over six American
cities are correlated. The results
in terms of complaints, claims,
and damage payments per million
sonic boom exposures are in good
agreement for cities studied, and
indicate that a single SST flight
across the United States would be
expected to cause about 400 com-
plaints, l50 damage claims, and
$4,500 in damage payments.

"And these are only conserva-
tive statistics." added Dr. Wil-
liam A. Shurcliffe. director of the
League.

ADVANTAGE: SPEED

According to Boeing. the major
advantages of the SST will be its
size and speed. “Speed. of course.
is the big plus. It will cruise at
1.800 miles per hour. carry about
300 passengers and be capable of
hopping non—stop from New York
to Paris in about two and one-half
hoursf‘

The Friends of the Earth, one
national environmental group.

feels that “the SST deserves op-
position for many reasons.

“Its adverse impact on the U.S.
balance of payments, hazards to
passenger safety in a craft, a
weak sales market consisting of
the already overcapitalized air
lines industry, the heavy invest-
ment of tax dollars in develop-
ment and construction costs, and
the real problem—environmental
degradation—-will have just be-
gun,” the group claims.

The SST threatens to change
world climate by creating "strat-
ospheric smog." the MIT Study
of Critical Environmental Prob-
lems reported in August. 1970.
"Gasses and particles produced
by jet exhaust may remain from
one to three years before disap-
pearing." said Russel Train. past
Undersecretary of the Depart-
ment of the Interior and current
chairman of President Nixon‘s
Council on Environmental Qual-
ity.

Furthermore. the scientist
member of the committee. Dr.
Gordon MacDonald. warned that
“there could be a reduction in the
amount _of ozone. which shields
the earth from damaging radia-
tion.

“If ozone is stripped from the
atmosphere,” he added, “this
would effectively wipe out life,
except in the oceans.”

While serving as Undersecre-
tary of the Interior. Mr. Train
cited atmospheric pollution and
ground contamination as further
environmental hazards posed by
the SST.

County Hearings Slated
For Major Polluters

by MICHAEL SIMON

V Two of Allegheny County's major polluters. the Duquesne Light
Company and the Homestead school district are scheduled for Vari-

ance Hearings in early December.

A variance is a temporary legal exemption from the Allegheny

County Air Pollution standards.

' The purpose behind an application for a Variance Board Hearing is
to inform the county that a particular organization cannot abide by the
Air Pollution Regulations. but will conform. or show evidence that it_

is trying to conform within the designated period of one year.

Variances are granted for only two reasons: “A. The emission oc-
curring or proposed to occur does not constitute a hazard to public
health or safety, and B. To require compliance with the terms of this
Article from which variance is sought and would not be in the public

interest.”

Some of the other factors to be taken into consideration include the
relative potency of the polluting substance on the air quality. the age
and efficiency of any anti—pollution equipment presently in usage by the
polluter. and any previous action taken by the polluter to alleviate his
present pollution output.

‘on

SEVERAI. MEMBERS of the University of Pittsburgh GASP Scientific Com-

mittee sitting in on a Variance Hearing.

Representatives from the Homestead School District are sched-

uled to meet on Dec. 7 in the Gold Room at the County Court Building.

Slated to appear on the 14th of December, again in the Gold

Room, are lawyers representing the Duquesne Light Company.

Student concern was expressed by Pitt GASP Chairman Mitch

Pines giving some insight into the mechanics of the Variance Rulings.

"The polluters really don‘t want to change." Pines stated, “they

are wasting time and money trying to adapt obsolete equipment.

Pines inferred that it would be less expensive for major polluters
to pay the proposed fine of $1,000 daily, than to undertake the costly re-

modeling and replacement of anti-pollution equipment.

"What is needed." Pines continued, "is a much stricker enforce-

ment of our present anti—pollution laws. “

Scheduled for the near future is an official ruling on the acceptable

air levels of carbon monoxide gas and the possibly incurred penalties.

The report will be put out by the Allegheny County Health Depart-

ment.

Whoops-T here Goes Another Sycamore

A little more of Pitts sparce
greenery has fallen prey to pro-
gress. The construction of a park-
ing lot at Alumni Hall has forced
the construction crews to cut
down at least three more of Pitts
ever decreasing tree population.

Captain Creighton. who is head
of the project and assistant direc-
tor of Pitt's Physical Plant Divi-
sion. stated that the reason these
trees had to be cut down was that
"we're building a parking lot. To
do this. we have cut a base out of

 

the land and lay the cement. There
was no way we could have left the
trees there. “

Creighton further stated that no
more than “two or three" trees
had been cut down.

Commenting on the controversy
that has arisen over the trees dur-
ing the past week, Creighton as-
serted that “no one in the whole
University loves trees, flowers or
shrubs as much as we do in the
physical plant division. You get to
love trees when you work as we do
and, even though you love trees,
you must cut them down when
they are diseased. They have to
come down.”

The head of the Facilities Main-

tainence Department (FMD).
Richard Burnhart. statedthat the

only role that the University has
in the project is a few supervi-
sory positions.

When asked how many trees
had come down. Barnhart guessed
"more than two." At least one of
the trees -was a sycamore. a
species that is presently undergo-
ing a blight in the eastern United
States. "The others." Barnhart
commented. "are black locust
trees. which are basically a weed
type tree."

The FMD has nothing to do with
the actual construction of the
parking lot. Barnhart stated that
his department will “landscape
and plant new trees after the con-
struction is over.”

According to one scientist. when
the SST tears down its two-mile
runway. it will be like 50 subsonic
jets taking off simultaneously.
The noise field would be three to
four times louder than the cur-
rent FAA standards permit.

A sonic boom arrives with a
sudden, unnerving bang and,a
pressure disturbance capable of
shattering windows, cracking
plaster, vibrating shelves, and
triggering rock slides.

If overland supersonic flight is»

permitted. people working. relax-
ing. sleeping will be banged re-
peatedly. and damage to glass.
plaster. and other materials could
amount to several million dollars
per day. according to environmen-
talists.

An alternative is a total ban on
all overland SST flight. The FAA
has proposed a boom ban regula-
tion. But if it should develop that

pends on overland flight. one DOT

According to the Washington of-

Environmental Action, Inc., Penn-

Environmental Action lobbyist
Barbara Ried stated. "Senator

there's still hope that Senator"

Schweiker will vote against ap-
propriating the $290 million for
the SST production.

Schweiker is still on the fence
and can be pushed either way. You
must show and convince him of
the environmental dangers of the
SST and hopefully he will cast a
negative vote."

In a statement released to the
Pitt News, the Environmental Ac-
tion-ZPG state office located here
at the University said. “We con-
clude that the Boeing SST project
has few signs of worthwhile val-
ue. The gains are merely quantita-
tive consisting of a modest sav-
ings in time.

“The drawbacks are impres-
sive: the sonic boom. the huge ex-
pense. the greater cluttering of

V airports. the uncertain safety and

environmental degradation. The
SST would create a new kind of
pollution. a world-wide sonic pol-
lution.

"We cannot believe that the
public. if it were aware of the ex-
tent to which the sonic boom can
interfere with daily life. would
permit its government to pay out
billions of dollars to Boeing et al
to create this new form of harass-
ment."

FALL TERM GRADES

Because of complications arising from converting to a new com-
puterized registration system, some students were not invoiced
for certain courses in which they are registered; consequently
grade cards were not produced for these and other students. Al-
though the system now has been corrected and is functioning well
for the winter term registration, a number of students will be put
to considerable inconvenience this term.

In order that all grades may be recorded properly, it is suggested
that students check with their instructors to be sure that they have

received grade cards for all courses, especially those for which
they have not been invoiced.

When it has been determined that the instructor has not received a
grade card, the student should stop at the Registrar’s office, G-59,
Cathedral of Learning, and pick up a substitute grade card. Those
students who have been invoiced will be asked to present a_vali-
dated invoice for the course in question. Students who have not
been invoiced for the course will be given an invoice for which pay-
ment will be due within one week.

It’s half-time for the Admin-

Now is a good a time as any to

examine the issue of greatest

I . ple at the time of his electio

— Vietnam. i

How have the Presidents
deeds matched his campaign
rhetoric? Some observations 2

(1) The President promised
to end the war and said he had
a plan to do so. That plan is
obviously a Vietnamization of
the conflict, i.e., turning over
the brunt of the fighting to the
South Vietnamese and gradually
phasing out Am/erican involve-

I  ment.

This is in line with the Nix-
on Doctrine of promising mili-

L tary and technical assistance

to besieged peoples, but being

very hesitant about committing
ground troops to battle.

   
 



%/;z'’/’’

(2) The war is winding
down without jeopardizing the
security of South Vietnam. De-
spite cries of “escalation” in
response to the Cambodian in-
tervention, the latest casualty
reports show that American
battle deaths during the per-
iod from January, 1970 to June,

1970 were the lowest since the
middle of 1966.

 

Also. they were a little less
than one third of the total suf-
fered from January to June of
1968.

Furthermore. Communist at-
tacks on Allied positions are de-
clining. from an average of 70-
75 per week in 1968 to about
65-70 during the early part of
this year. And officials now
estimate that about 90% of
South Vietnams population is
living in areas under Allied
control.

All of this and still American
troops continue to pull out.
Sources close to the Adminis
tration now say that they hope
to have all American combat
troops out of Vietnam by the
end of 1971. '

dozen other rationalizations had not delayed

I her period.

She didn't know much about her body then.

and that too had been a comfort. It had helped

her to pretend. But all of a sudden, nature had

steered her through a crash course in the sub-

ject. As it turned out, Margie didn’t know much
about anything. Except facts.

Of the five roommates. she had read the most

I pamphlets about contraception and had attended

the most lectures at the University when the
crusade was at its height. Once. she even sent a
$5.00 contribution to the Abortion. Justice League.

But when it came down to the real thing.
“the guy" was uncomfortable. It "bothered
him" so he was uncooperative. Margie confided

i to me afterwards that "he just didn’t think it was

natural to use anything. it just sort of took some-
thing out of it.“ So she resigned herself. What
could she do?

It . was important to Margie that she be
strong. Her pride got in the way. I sensed that

‘ she found it immensely difficult to confide in
line, but even she couldn’t withstand the lone-

liness.

 Life Of A Pitt Nursing Student  

till this time every Thursday.

“Wish I were an English major carrying
12 credits.”

But with 12 credits (even going extra terms.
as all good Pitt student nurses do) it would
take about seven years of school. And just think
of the all-female classes you'd miss—like micro-
biology and pathophysiology where the grading
is straight percentage—~94‘.'} and above for an A.
86',/é-94’/9 for a B. etc. Cake courses. It could be
worse. You could be a Med-Surg hermit. in
which case you spend 10'} of your time eating.
5% sleeping. 0.2% defecating. 58.3‘; working in
the library and 26.19; worrying. Choice. oh sure
you have a choice. Would you like to go to
class or make up the-days you missed with the
rest of the campus during the election on the
next couple of Saturdays before Christmas‘?

The greatest feeling in the whole world is
when a 78 year old man with white hair. whom
you‘ve just shaved this first shave in months).
helped with his bath. changed his colostomy
bag. suctioned his tracheostomy tube and air-
way. sat him up in a wheelchair. propping up a
stump of a leg. takes your hand and kisses it
and with tears in his weary eyes hoarsely whis-
pers “God bless you.“ You both cry.

We've changed the uniform regulations for
future classes~—one inch above the knee. We've
put up a petition for a good instructor to come
back to the faculty. Another instructor sadly re-
marks. "I can remember the day when a stu-
dent was afraid to say anything.” Were such
a rebellious “lot. Who knows what we'll want
next—maybe an eight hour work day.

Student nurses—give your soul to God, Pitt
School of Nursing wants your body!!!

It’s Not As If You’veBeen Raped’

There wasn‘t much that I could do. Merely
reassure and reinforce and understand. Basic
things. “The guy” had capitalized on Margies
strength and he patted her on the back. relieved
that "sheicould handle it so well." The doctor
had advised the inevitable.

"You‘re old enough to get married.“ he had
said. "Women eventually do. you know. and have
children. Its not as if you‘d been raped."

We went out to eat every night during those
days Margie was always hungry. She had given
up her perennial diet; it hardly mattered then.

We sat for those hours playing games with
each other. We both knew that Margie would
seek an abortion and. in our ignorance. we were
convinced that it would probably be illicit. So
we avoided talking about it.

We allowed ourselves to play “suppose".
Suppose she had it; we would take turns baby
sitting; she would quit school and run the gen-
eral studies circuit; or maybe. it could be a
communal baby: it would live in the apartment
and all of the roommates would play nurse; we
would schedule classes appropriately.

We laughed, eating cheese burgers, drink-
ing cokes. She would be the woman with a past.
I would be the long suffering friend. Just like
Hollywood. Later in life, we would write a
book; it would be a bestseller.

But then time when the man in the next
booth lit a cigarette and the smoke wafted over.
Margie began to cough. nauseated. Her eyes
reddened and she put her head down. And when
she raised it again. she was crying and I was
crying and we knew. ,

is reaching major proportions,
and the Administration must
take note of this.

Should the Reds muster an-
other massive offensive. as
they are still capable of do-
ing. before ARVN is sufficient-
ly prepared.  Nixon may
be forced to alter his strategy
slightly.

Neither event. however.
should cause the U.S. to re-
commit massive numbers of
ground troops. It would be
strategically unwise as well as
politically suicidal. Rather.
Mr. Nixon would probably in-
crease military and technical
assistance or make use of effec-
tive tactical bombing in North
Vietnam by hitting meaningful
targets. not trucks and empty
army barracks. Also. limited
interventions. such as Cambo-
dia. should be held in reserve.

(4) In time, the President
will probably begin to place
more and more emphasis on
Vietnamization and less and
less onthe Paris Peace Talks.
As in Korea, more Americans
have been killed after the
peace talks started than be-
fore.

While some diehards like
Senator Fullbright worry that
we might "jeopardize“ the
talks. then. it is hard to under-
stand what we are jeopardiz-
ing. Given the Communist
view of negotiations. it is pro-
bable that rather than a formal
peace treaty. the war will just
fade away.

However. a serious deterior-
ation of the enemys military
position could cause them to
begin to negotiate seriously in
hopes of winning at the peace
table what they couldn’t win on
the battlefield. Mr. Nixon must
guard against another Yalta.

Richard Nixon promised to
end the war without sacrificing
Americas vital interests and he
is doing that. Every deadline
he has set for troop withdraw-
als (including Cambodia) has
been met. Should this continue.
and barring unforseen circum-
stances it should.

Mr. Nixon can go to the
electorate in 1972. his pledge
to end the war fulfilled. A
plus for Mr. Nixon; and a min-
us for the Democrats. who can
coo all they want. The public
won‘t give a hoot.

Voice From The Ghetto

 

 

Value Property More Than Life

 

by RICHARD J. PALAZZI
In writing my last article. on the disturbances in the ghettos.
something came to mind that frightened me when it happened.

I was only a trainee of one week when the April rioting
broke out in 1968. It was all very new and frightening to me.
but it didn't last very long. And then. the following week. Mayor

Daley of Chicago gave the police orders to “

. shoot to kill

arsonists. and shoot to maim looters.“

The pros and cons flew fast and furious over that one. as
they somehow always do when Daley speaks. Some people say he
had to eat his words. and some say his pronouncement stands to
this day. but nobody knows for sure. I went to the city council
meeting the next day. and I still can’t figure out what he said.

But that’s irrelevant anyway. The frightening part of what
Mayor Daley said is the philosophy behind it. And that is, bas-
ically, “put the value of property above the value of human life.” '
This is a pgilosophy that is all too prevalent in every social level,
and one that hits the ghetto hardest of all. For you see, poor peo-
ple’s lives aren’t valuable to anybody, so it is very, very easy to
take advantage of them, even to the point of obliterating them.

This is how it is with the merchants who make a profit from
selling unsafe products to poor people: this is how it is with the
slum lords whose houses are health and safety hazards to those
who must rent them; and this is how it is with us if we sit back
in our comfortable homes and support. financially and politi-
cally. the people who let these things happen —. the people who
value property more than human life.

We. the middle class. are the people who run the country.
We are the masses. and we control the government and the eco-
nomy. It is time for us to stop being lulled into complacency by
any corrupt rich or any self-righteous government.

We are powerful; we are good people: we must now become
aware.

B lack Week
’Mo ves’ Wliite

iﬁditor. The Pitt News: —

This letter is to express my sen-
timents on Black Week. Black
Week was a ver_v valuable and un-
iisual learning experience for me.
What disgusted me was the lack of
interest displayed by the white
population of this l'niversity.

I asked some of m_v white
friends to join me in taking ad-
vantage of an opportunit_v to learn
something about Black culti.ire.
They shooed me away calling me
a troublemaker.

My reply was. “Your apath_v
makes me sick. You are more
concerned with what's going on
overseas than with what's going
on here." I also apply this same
comment in general to our white
societ_v. We are more concerned
about fixing our neighbors leaky
roof than we are about stopping
the downpour in our own house.

I was told that if I attended
some of the Black Week functions.
I would be "jumped.“ Well. all I
have to say is that I attended most
of the activities of that week in-
cluding Friday night's crowning
events with no bruises and I be-
came a little more mature than I
was on Monday of that week.

We were allocated money for one

Final Word
To The Editor. The Pitt News;

I‘d like to explain my involve-
ment in the display fracas at the
abortion conference last week.

A student representative from
the Women Concerned for the
Unborn Child contacted me the
week before the conference seek-
ing permission to put up the dis-
play. He had been to a number
of different offices in the Uni-
versity. he said. and nobody
quite knew who'had the auth-
ority to provide such authoriza-
tion. The last office he contact-
ed had told him it probably was
me. -

We've all had the experience
of trying to get a decision out of
a large and complex organiza-
tion.
greater virtue to make a decision
on the basis of common sense in-
stead of forcing the student on
an endless trek. the very frustra-
tions of which could be mistaken
for a political. position by the
institution.

The "common sense consider-
ations" were these:

The new Office of Special Ev-
ents. which must approve of the
use of University facilities by
outside groups. had only recent-
ly been established. Its authority
and responsibilities had not been
completely delineated. nor its
functions widely publicized.
and at that particular moment

I thought it would be at

 

 

on F racas

in time there was some question
whether a display in a lobby
area fell under its purview.

It seemed to me that the pro-
blem should be treated as an ex-
tension of the concept of aca-
demic freedom; the display could
go up as long as it was under-
stood that other viewpoints could
have access to the same med-
ium. -

Now a week later when it be-
came clear that the display did
fall under the purview of the Of-
fice of Special Events and
that. using roughly the same cri-
teria that of_fice most likely would
issue a permit. it seemed like a
somewhat Mickey Mouse opera-
tion. to force the group to close
up shop for a half hour while
the formalities were accom-
plished. On almost any other
occasion. most students would
be irate at this kind -of bureau-
cratic conduct.

So the permit was issued and
the group was allowed to contin-
ue.

Now my only point is simply
that there wasn't anything poli-

I tical about any of this at all. It

didn‘t signify one damn thing
about the substantive issue of
abortion reform.

l)ear Editor:
I would like to make some comments on the
letter‘ on abortion by .Ioan I)errick.
I was stunned to find such a narrow. Victor-
ian attitude toward abortion from someone whom

I presume to be a Pitt student and a member of
the generation that wants to end war and pro-

mote a better quality of life for all mankind;

She asks. “Could it be that Planned Parent-
hood has been bitten by the ‘population control
bug‘ and is no longer concerned with fetal life
or the mothers ultimate welfare?” (‘ould it be.
in fact. that Planned Parenthood. as well as oth-
er agencies of population control. are concern-
ed with the quality of life rather than the self-
appointed right of the human race to over-pop-
ulate this planet.

Properly performed by a competent physician
under sanitary conditions an abortion is as safe
as a tonsillectomy. and it done within the first
ten weeks is far less uncomfortable.

Since 1948 abortion has been used as a state-
approved method of birth control with no resul-
tant ill effects such as the sterility suggested by
Miss Derrick and her pamphlets. This is easily
seen by the number of women who have multi-
ple abortions.

Needless to  a less drastic method of birth
control may be preferred. but the reality of wo-
men already pregnant with unwanted children
cannot be ignored. tTwenty percent of pregnan-
cies in the l'.S. are terminated every year.
Thousands die needlessly at the hands of un-
qualified practitioners.)

As far as the mothers ultimate welfare is
concerned. and this should be the primary con-
cern. what could be more traumatic or have
more lasting repercussions than a mother sad-

died with an unwanted child’? The mothers
anguish is bound to be taken out on the rest of
the family and certainly w.ithout justification
on the unfortunate child. lﬁveryone suffers.
What kind of start in life does an unloved child
have‘? What meaning has life without love‘.’

.\‘liss I)errick states that "in almost every case.
abortion. whether legal or illegal. is a traumatic
experience that may have severe kickbacks later
on.“ I submit that exactly the opposite is true.
Studies have shown that the almost universal
reaction of women who voluntarily undertook
abortions «assuming they did not have to go to a
backstreet butcher» is one of pure and simple
relief. nothing more prolonged or complicated
than that.

This brings up the issue of the legality of‘

abortion. (Tan anyone deny a woman the right
to choose whether or not to bear a child‘? Should
those who call themselves ‘.‘compassionate” and

(Editor's Note: The author of the
following treaties has written her
essay in response to the slew of
letters that The Pitt News received
this term dealing with “economic
co-opting of the so-called counter
culture.”

(In introduction, Ormglasse pro-
posed that “it is one of several life-

and-death matters which will de-’

termine the eventual success or fail-
ure ol the youth culture in revising
the American life style.”)

by SARA ORMGLASSE

In formulating specific ele-
ments of a life style, it is al-
ways necessary to refer to the
underlying values or, philoso-
phies which suggest the form
which those elements should na-
turally take.

With the counter culture, how-
ever, there has been as yet no
comprehensive statement of phi-
losophical values, since it is pre-
cisely in this area that experi-
mentation and tolerance are en-
couraged.

e For this reason, any treatment

.of a particular element of life
Wisifjiile such as craftsmanship must

derive its validity more through
instinct or, if you will, a philo-
sophical “sense of the meeting."
With this uncertain forward. let
us plunge into the subject and
bathe in its essence rather than
contemplate the diving tech-

’ niques.

The existentialist view of life

suggests that one of the basic‘

concepts of this philosophy is
the idea of freedom. Freedom is
based upon the ability to make
decisions.

For example, in (L’age de Rai-
son) by Jean-Paul Sartre. the
first time Matheau experiences
‘freedom comes when he arbi-
trarily plunges a knife into his

A hand as a demonstration of his

own descisiveness after it had
been called into question by an-
other character.

the first volume) ends with Ma-

theau making the arbitrary de-
cision to die. when there are no
constraints present to coerce his
choice, and thereby achieving
another existential moment of
freedom.

Making Decisions

An in-depth analysis of the
concept of freedom must always
include the idea of decision-
making in some form. For exam-
ple. a prisoner in a jail is not
free because someone or some
agent is constraining his abili-
ty to make decisions pertaining
to his spatial location on the
globe.

Let us ignore for the time be-
ing the implications this holds
for each of us as citizens of coun-
tries which require one to have
passports, justifications. etc..
for traveling abroad.
self-imposed limitations to free
travel such as jobs. money. and
so on.

A common conception of a
free mind is one which can make
decisions “independently" of
what a peer group or superiors
may think. It seems then. that
the act of making decisions is
an integral part of the existen-
tial and common-conception
views of freedom.

Besides freedom, another “val-
ue” often sought after within
the counter culture is the con-
cept of happiness. This should
not be taken to mean a contin-
uous state of euphoria.

In fact. it may include sorties
or experiments into depression
or other emotional states. as
well as a “high" state. It seems
logical to hold that decision-
making is an integral factor in
the value of happiness.

To demonstrate this. let us
shift into the realm of Psychol-
ogy. Psychologist Daniel Katz
holds that “if there is one con-
firmed finding in all the studies
of worker morale and satisfac-
tion. it is the correlation be-
tween the variety and challenge
of the job with respect to his
job.

and the "

As in Thoreau‘s day. the pur-
pose of big industry is "that
the corporations may be en-
riched." with minimal concern
for the worker (and in a society
such as ours. the consumer is the
worker and vice versa).

Katz expressed this philosophy
towards the worker when he
pointed out:

. . . .“lndustry has demonstrated,
however, that it is more effi-
cient to produce via assembly-

line methods with lowered
motivation and job satisfac-
tion than with highly moti-

vated craftsmen with a large
area of responsibility in turn-
ing out their part of the total
project.”

Why Mass Production?

Katz was. of course. assuming
the necessity of mass production
in order to discover how to
counteract its adverse psycholo-
gical effect upon the individual
worker.

To me. this seems to be mak-
ing the symptom go away and
leaving the disease as a neces-
sary evil. Here is where the so-
ciety as a whole (if it has a mind
to) and the individual himself
or herself who is the concern
of the counter culture. can
choose to reject the value of
“efficiency" and substitute what
we will call "quality gratifica-
tion.“ Quality not only in the
sense of quality of life. but in
quality of environment and qual-
ity of product.

Again. Katz. in an aside to the
defense of his position. observes
that:

“The quality of production
may suffer somewhat, but it is
still cheaper to buy several
mass-produced cars, allowing
for programming for obsoles-
cence, than it is to buy a sin-
gle quality product like the
Rolls Royce.”

By substituting "quality grati-

personal value system. we achieve
quality of environment and

fication" for "efficiency" in the

the gratifications which accure
to workers (Morse. 1953. >“

In the context of his paper
The Motivational Basis of Or-
ganizational Behavior, by Dan-
iel Katz. No. 57 in Current Per-
spectives in Social Psychology,
eds. Hollander and Hunt. 1967).
it seems clear that by "variety
and challange" Katz implies
the quantity and quality of de-
cisions necessary for the execu-
tion ol' a particular job.

Craftsmanship

With this example. Katz also
introduces the subject of this
paper. craftsmanship as it per-
tains to the job. Philosopher
Thoreau to complete the transi-
tion:

‘‘I cannot believe that our
factory system is the best
mode by which men may get
clothing, the condition of the
operatives is becoming every
day more like that of the En-
glish; and it cannot be won-

dered at, since, as far as I
have heard or observed, the
principle object is, not that

mankind may be well and hon-
estly clad, but, unquestionably,
that the corporations may be
enriched." (Henry David
Thoreau, Walden (Twaynes,
New York, T962), p. 40.)

Perhaps the ‘‘conditions‘‘ which

» Thoreau considers are primarily

physical conditions such as low
pay and long hours. but his
statement also implies a psycho-
logical "condition" to which
these workers were subjected.

I would hold that when these
“conditions“ produce deficien-
cies in “variety and challenge"
of a job. the worker loses his
opportunity to make vital deci-
sions in his life. or that part of
his life which is his work.

Here is where the concept of ”

freedom. freedom dependent
upon the ability to make deci-
sions. re-enters the scene. When
the worker finds that because
of the nature of his work he no
longer is permitted to make de-
cisions. he also discovers that he
has lost freedom we produce
fewer (though more expensive)
units which do not rush them-
selves into obsolescence and have
to be discarded in junk yards.
dumps. streams. and so on.

The quality of the product it-
self is increased when construc-
ted by craftsmen. for it becomes
a human thing,

Aside from these important
fringe benefits. though. this pa-'
per principally concerns the
quality of life which is enhanc-
ed through craftsmanship. as
opposed to mass production.

This increased quality of life
stems directly from the increase
of freedom and happiness on
the part of the craftsman. who
is now permitted to make a wid-
er range of decisions in the
course of his days work.

This would seem to be the
rationale for attempts on the
part of the counter culture to
establish and reinforce within
itself the craftsmanship value as

an element in the individual life ‘

style.

Through a strategy of confin-
ing all possible purchases to pro-
ducts made by craftsmen rather
than by an assembly line indus-
try, “quality gratification" may
be-substituted for “efficiency"
as a value. and thereby in-
crease the freedom and happi-
ness not only of the mass of
workers. but of the individual.
who. more than likely. must
eventually become a worker of
some kind.

The 45th Pittsburgh Interna-
tional Exibition of Contempor-
ary Art. which opened at Carne-
gie Institute on October 30. par-
allels the traditional aims and
purposes of the past Internation-
als by presenting its viewers
with 267 examples of the mod-
ern art of the world.

All art is the expression of the
mind of the artist. Myriad view-
ers extract some type of tangent
purpose by saying that art is
not only a reflection of the pas-
sion and actions of the time of
the artist but that an artist has
an obligation to those who view
his art.

The artist has no obligation
to the viewer. An artists only
committment is to himself to
attempt to re-create his own
thoughts and emotions on any
subject important to him. No
viewer can fully understand the
meaning and purpose of any sin-
gle work or any artist. for no
viewer can ultimately compre-
hend the mind of the artist. his
joys and frustrations when he
emotionally speaks out through
hisart.

Thus it is with the 1970 In-
ternational. One sees the contin-
ual movement of the minds of
101 artists in their effort to ex-
press roles and forces of man
in the universe, through their
aspirations as humanity’s spokes-
men.

The majority of the art differs
little from what was shown at
the 1967 International: only
twenty—three of the 101 artists
represented were not in the last
triennial.

The archaic prize system that
had existed and dominated the
Pittsburgh Internationals since
the inception of the shows in

1896 has been discarded. The

 

abandonment of this sentimental
custom removes all previous
guidelines for the “best“ art and
prompts each viewer to be guid-
ed only by his own preferences.

In an effort to enable most
painters and sculptors to exhibit
three or more works and thus
achieve a higher level of repre-
sentation of each artist, the num-
ber of artists in the 1970 Inter-
national has been reduced to

less than one-third that of the
1967 International.

This can be seen as a major
break through. in not only pro-
viding better representation. but
as a partial elimination of the
hodgepodge and lack of visual
continuity that has marked many
past exhibitions of this nature.

The 1970 International breaks
from these guidelines only to
exhibit a single work of a spe-
cial group of twelve artists. all
of whom are seventy years of
age or older.

These works by such masters
as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, and
Bram van Velde are shown in
second floor Gallery B. Accord-
ing to the Museum of Art's dir-
ector Leon Anthony Arkus, “They
should be considered masters of
their time and their art is fam-
iliar to all in the art world.”

To respond to the individual
works at the International would
be an impossible task. One can
only attempt to relate to each
work as a ‘concrete. visual exten-
sion of the artists mind.

ed by Otto Piene‘s "Red Rapid

AS SOON as you are arrested, the
police must allow you to call a
lawyer or someone else who can
help you. You are allowed to make
a reasonable number of telephone
calls from the police station at once.
If you do not have the right change,
or you do not know the lawyer's
number, ask the police to make
change for you and to give you a
telephone book.

If they do not want to, ask and
keep asking until they do.

If you do not know the number of
a lawyer, or are afraid you won't
find him in, it might be better to
call a friend or member of your
family, who could then telephone a
lawyer for you.

You need not answer questions
or sign anything until the lawyer is
there.

If you are arrested for drunk driv-
ing, you may ask for a blood test.

If you have not been drinking,
the test will be in your favor. But if
you have, it can be used against
you.

Adams also said that Payne wouldn't be permitted on the

No Panther

By JERRY MYERS

With a convincing opening
night victor'y over Gettysburg.
the Pitt Panthers move out of
their home territory to battle
Fordham University in New
York. tomorrow night at 8 p.m.

The Cagers renew a series with
the Rams that dates all the way
back to the 1929-30 season when
the Panthers beat Fordham 31-27.
Since then the teams have met.
19 times with Pitt holding the
edge with twelve victories and
only seven defeats.

Top lettermen returning to
the Ram squad after a 10-15
season in 1969-70 are Charles
Yelverton and Bill Mainor.
Yelverton led Fordham in scor-
ing last year with 15.3 points
per game. followed by Mainor
with a 14.5 tally.

 

“Yelverton was an outstand-
ing high school athlete in New
York City," said Panthers
Coach ‘Buzz’ Ridl. “He’s an un-
believable jumper. He stands
about 6-2, 6-3, but gets up there
like a 6-6-er.”

Ridl also named Mainor. and
guard Tom Pipich as people the
Panthers will have to contend
with in their second contest of
the season. Pipich averaged 18.1
points per game on a Fordham
freshman squad that recorded
eleven victories in sixteen games.
Their scoring leader was for-
ward Ken Charles.

“The last time we played Ford-
ham was in 1968.“ Ridl contin-
ued. "Both Yelverton and Main-
or were on the team then. They

Changes Fo

have experienced players and
they'll also have a home-court
advantage.“

Two years ago, in a year that
saw Pitt struggle through a 4-20
season, Fordham rolled over the
Panthers 66-44. The year before
that the Rams went to t_he Na-
tional Invitational Tournament,
which was the last time Ford-
ham was invited to a post-sea-
son classic.

Forwards Ken Charles and
Bark Woytowicz are both up
from the Rams freshmen team.
competing for the starting spots
up front. Charles averaged 27.8
last year and Woytowicz was
second on the team in scoring
with an average of 19.0. Return-
ing lettermen for the Rams. Tom

 

Cager coaches, Buzz Ridl and Fran Webster

Sullivan and Bob Larbes are bat-
tling the two freshmen at the
forward positions and John Bur-
ik. Steve Cain and Pete Caries-
imo return to the Ram backcourt.

“John Burik is one of the four
men we have to watch," com-
mented Ridl. "He also played
on the ‘68 team.“

“It’s hard to see on the Ford-
ham court,” commented assist-
ant coach Fran Webster. “It’s a
lot like West Virginia’s old field
house. It’s sort of dark and it’s
very deep-set.”

Ridl seemed very satisfied
with the way the Panthers per-
formed in their game against
Gettysburg. "I was very pleased
with the way our team open-
ed." Ridl said. "We played some
real sound basketball. shooting
good and moving the ball around
the court.“

Gymnasts Open Against
Slow Starting Cadets

by STEVE WILLIAMS

Tomorrow Warren Niger‘s gymnastics team
will travel to West Point. New York for the season

j — opening meet with Army.

Niger is optimistic concerning the outcome of
the up-and—coming meet. ‘

"Army could be taken." he said. "They are
usually a very slow starting team which will be
a big plus in our favor." ‘

Army is an unknown foe to the Pitt gymnasts
this season. Last year Army defeated Pitt by less
than nine points. 134-125.4. Threegymnasts from
that victorious team graduated but the quality
of their replacements remains to be seen. Also
with the freshmen eligibility rule. where all fresh-
men are allowed to compete on the varsity level
the question is muddied even further in evaluat-
ing what kind of performance to expect from
Army.

Mike Beatty, captain of Pitt’s team, expects
Army to have a “good side horse team, a hori-

‘ zontal bar and parallel bar team which isn’t bad

and a floor exercise team which is weak.”

Pitt will counter with a team that expects
to be strong in four events: floor exercise. side
horse. long horse and still rings.

Lowell Meek. last years Eastern champ. will
lead the floor exercise team.

Dave Andrew, last years captain, Richard
Pribis and Ed Swerdlow will add depth to this
event.

The second event. one of Pitts best side
horse. will feature captain Mike Beatty. Bob Rod-
gers and possibly freshman Charles Pidgeon.

Vaulting over the long horse will be the team
of Beatty. Andrew. Pribis and Swerdlow.

The strong ring team consists of Jim Bilec,
1968 MVP, Frank Swift and Lowell Meek.

Bilec believes that “we should win a
place in the first four events".

But the parallel bars and the horizontal bar

first

'  are still a problem for Niger.

Steve Weiss, last year's number one man on
the “p-bars,” hasn't been able to practice due. to
mononeucleosis.

 

Phil Lilly injured his shoulder in practice this
week. .-

Both of these gymnasts participate on the
parallel bars. Weiss and Lilly were the number
one and two men respectively in that event.

Against Army, Beatty, Chris Gardner and Dan
Campbell will be on the “p-bars."

Niger said "We have no specialists or overall
men who are exceptional on the horizontal bar.“

Meek. Gardner and Campbell compete in the
horizontal bar event.

As Bilec summed up. "Were depleted where
we need people. but if we score high enough in
our best events and in the weaker ones we can
win this meet."

JIM BILEC
Gym Ring Man

 

Everyone appeared healthy
at practice this week including
Marv Abrahms who sat out
the game Wednesday nights
game because of illness. Cleve-
land Edwards has not yet return-
ed to the practice floor and pro-
bably won't do so until the end
of this month.

Ridl also announced that he
will be going with the same
starting line-up that he had on
the court against Gettysburg.
That means that Kent Scott and
Bill Downes will be at the guard
positions, Carl Morris and Mike
Paul will be at forward and 6-8
Paul O’Gorek will hold down the
center position.

Once again Ridl is counting
on his veterans to keep the Pan-
ther offense going. waiting un-
til later in the game to test out
his sophomores. Carl Morris is
still the only sophomore in the
starting five.

Colonials Test
F rosh Strength‘

In Coraopolis

by MARTY HELLMAN

This Saturday night at 8 p.m.. the freshman basketball team runs
up against one of its traditionally hardest foes. the Robert Morris

Colonials.

The contest will be played at the Robert Morris campus in Cor-
aopolis. All Pitt students will be admitted free upon presentation of

ID cards.

Both squads clobbered their opening game opponents earlier
this week. The Colonials battered the Butler Community College on
Monday. 99-71. while the Cubs did likewise to the Pitt-Greensburg

campus on Tuesday. 94-61.

Coach Gus Krop of Robert Mor-
ris and Cub Coach Tim Grgurich
agree that the teams are evenly
matched and both forsee a very
tight game.

"The Pitt frosh are compara-
ble to us in size." commented
Krop after watching the Tuesday
night Cub game. "It will be a

physical matchup between the
two teams.“
Grgurich replied that. "It

should be a very strong game.
They are real tough inside and

their guards are even with
oursf‘
Leading the Colonials under

the boards is Ron Hightower, who
tallied 23 points and 15 rebounds
against Butler. The 6-5 freshman
will be backed up by 6-6 Johna-
than Marshall and 6-7 Dwight
Kanner.

Along with Kanner. Jim Dash-
ield also returns as a starter from
last year's squad which compiled
a 23-4 record.

_ Women's varsity basketball is taking on a new look this season-
everything from rules to uniforms are being changed.

5 Upuntil this year. women's basketball was played with a six man
- court—six players on the court for each team with only two of these

35:‘ players. the rovers. able to play both sides of the court.

5 Now women‘s basketball will be played with experimental rules

 .:A which are similar to men‘s varsity basketball rules.

_ The decision to play with an experimental five man court was
made. two years ago by the Division for Girl’s and Women’s Sports

‘ the area were not able to comply

 fwith DGgWS's decision.

lThe location for playing wom-

{'en"s basketball at Pitt will also be

; I ’_,changed this year. Many of the
A ‘__{‘-égarnes this season are to be play-
. 3 ed at the Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitts Athletic Director Casi-

‘ Imir Myslinski has contacted the

heads of women's sports at Trees

. Hall and has encouraged women

to use university facilities which

i  __ are available to them.

I‘ The coach of women’s. basket-

 5 ball at Pitt, Miss Sandra Bullman,

f_ feels that using the Field House

may prove to be a good drawing

"The Field House is impres-

 j_ siveenough and our girls good

only help us draw more specta-

Pitt's women’s varsity basket-
ball team finished last season
with a record of 10-l—losing only
to Slippery Rock. Only two start-
ing players will be lost to the team
this year and Coach Bullman is
very encouraged by the new re-
cruits.

"I haven't seen much of our
new prospects but what little I
have seen look good." she said.
"I‘ll know definitely when prac-
tice begins. “

Pitt's women's basketball team
will play a tough schedule this
year. Kent State and Westchester
are being added to a schedule al-
ready filled with tough competi-
tion. Westchester is ranked num-
ber one in the nation in women‘s
basketball and Kent State is a
basketball powerhouse in its own
right.

The women‘s basketball season
does not begin until January. but
basketball practice begins today.

Eiiiii Fij is Top Frat Players at

by MARK SIGMAN

On third down and goal. Fiji quarterback Jim
"Duke“ Ayers took the snap and rolled to his right.
Suddenly. he stopped. turned. and rifled a touch-
down pass to Wayne "Rocky" Pile in the far corner
of the end zone.

This play occurred many times during the just
completed fraternity intramural football season.
In large part due to this explosive offensive tandem.
Phi Gamma Delta captured its first,IFC football
championship in nearly
three decades.

When informed that
they had been chosen as
the Pitt News’ most val
uable players (tie vote)
in the fraternity league.
both Ayers and Pile ex-
pressed surprise and
gratitude at the honor be-
stowed upon them.

Pile, a two-way performer for the Fijis, and an
ex-Wilkinsburg High standout in both football and
baseball, gave the credit for his league-leading sev-
en pass interceptions to his defensive teammates.

 

Ayers, Pile Team
Up To Share MVP

 

 

He explained. "With defensive ends like (Vince)
Corsi and (Bill) Mamakos. in addition to our speedy
cornerbacks (Van Krause and Rich Rizzuto). I was
able to rove to the side I thought the play would be
going.

Ayers. a Baldwin High letterman in both base-
ball and wrestling. placed great faith in the tight-
ly-knit team organization and fiery team spirit.

In addition, Ayers stated that “having blockers
like Frank Rodzwicz and Tony Brusca made my job
as quarterback a lot easier than I had expected.

In seven games. “Duke" completed 67 per cent
of his passes and had a hand in every Fiji TD. Mean-
while. “Rocky'7caught 22 aerials. with eight of
them worth six points apiece.

Both Ayers and Pile felt that the Fijis can win
the IFC title again next fall. Only two starters. the
“Duke" and middle linebacker Rich Clark. will be
missing next season.

When asked about playing on Pitt Stadiums
AstroTurf. both Wayne and Jim enthusiastically
complimented the artificial playing surface. How-
ever. neither could understand why only the fra-
ternities were allowed to play on the AstroTurf.

Women’s, Gym Team Track Team

Claims Victory Status

The Pitt women‘s gymnastic
team has finally achieved varsity
status here on campus and in its
schedule.

“We do 5 have three tough teams
on our schedule.“

The gal gymnasts open their

Trials Set

Track Coach Jim Banner has
called a varsity inter-squad meet
to be held on Saturday afternoon
at 1 p.m.

Coach Mary Santillo‘s charges
will challenge the likes of Kent
State. Clarion State and Slippery
Rock.

The coach is particularly con-
cerned about Kent State. who has
been one of three national cham-
pions in the last five years. The
Flashes have been invited to the
championships many times.

Slippery Rock is always a pow-
er in the district, and the Rockets
were the only team to beat Pitt's
women gymnasts in their three
matches last year.

"I hope we can win all of our

season against West Virginia. and
Davida Schwartz has been desig-
nated as captain for that match.
She is a veteran from last years
squad. one of seven returning
competitors.

The other girls on the squad are
Becky Volkin, Donna DeMarino,
Mary Fedorka, Jackie Adams,
Donna Saunders, Debbie Gott-
shall and Carol Cafrelli.

As with most varsity sports the
women gymnasts are practicing
nightly in preparation for their
difficult schedule.

The Fitzgerald Field House will
be the scene of this years first
such inter-squad contest. It is be-
ing held in order to expose the
thinclads to some competitive ac-
tion and to give the coaches an
opportunity to get some realistic
times and heights for their squad.

There will be both a blue squad
and a red squad set for action on
Saturday. with the division of
ability being made as evenly as

possible in order to get maximum ,

performances out of the contes-
tants.

It you heard that a baseball player was the most
yaliiahle player on a football team. you would proh-
ahly do a doiihle take. 'l'liat's something like saying
that tlene .\lley of the l’ii‘ates was the most yalii~

Ken .\Iaeha. the left lielder on Iiobhy Lewis‘

"I dont want _\otl to put down that I did all the

Even though .\lacha tries to sliy away from the cred-
it. the lacts speak tor tlieiiiselyes. In the champion-
ship game loi‘ instance. .\Iaeha scored 17 of the
teams 19 points including two touchdowns and a 37-
yard field goal.

This was the pattern that Macha set throughout
the regular season also. Ile insisted that he could
not have done it all alone.

“'l‘he team had a hand it." he said. “I might haye
scored the points. but the team made it possible "

The team that .\laeha refers to is .\‘iitherland

NC-»\.»\ Hair Rule

(.'r»Iif1)1I1u/ fro//1 Pu//c 12)

Despite Smeltz' performance. Adams admits that losing
.\Iark Payne will hurt his team. which is bidding for national
honors this year. Perhaps the New York champions importance
to the squad has saved him from complete dismissal at this
point.

“He’s not wrestling now.” Adams said when asked about
punishment for Payne. “That's punishing him. But if things
change he can come back."

It‘s doubtful that Payne will decide to get his hair cut.

He has been on the sidelines before and knows what it
means to sit out of competition. Injury kept him from a few
matches last year and he sat through a very frustrating Eastern
Championships meet in March of 1969 because a kidney disor-
der was detected a few days before he was to challenge for a title.

Last night Payne didn't appear to be as dejected as he was
that day two years ago in Princeton. N. .I.. when he watched the
Iiasterns from the stands. lie does feel that the officials are
guilty of prejudice against him and his locks. but he quietly sat
out in protest. accepting the role of spectatorv and camera man
for his brother.
