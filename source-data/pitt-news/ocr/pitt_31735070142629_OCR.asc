With a 13 percent turnout, Pitt students

Student Government Board president.

Shull took 67 percent of the votes
for board president yesterday,
receiving 709 more votes than his
sole opponent, Justin Romeo.

The number of students vot-
ing in the election decreased by
43 percent from last year. Out

people submitted an online bal-
lot.

Despite his loss, Romeo em-
braced Shull with a hug to con-

gratulate him on the win.

Shull said he is looking for-
ward to “do the things [he] prom-
ised.” ,

. Most notably, Shull plans to
continue implementing a proj-
ect he began as a board member
— the Symplicity program, an

online resource that he hopes
will make SGB allocations for
student groups more tr_anspar-
ent and efﬁcient. He also wants
to improve student government’s
communication with city officials
by reaching out to them early in
his term.

Shull said he is pleased with
the candidates who were elected
to the board. M

“I think we got some great

‘people elected,” Shull said. “They

are great at management, and

hopefully, students will start to

see things get done next year.”
He said he was looking for-

ward to spending time with his

girlfriend in celebration of the

win. *

the results.

Mayor talks tax on students

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said there’s “a
certain amount of unfairness” to his
proposed Fairishare Tax.

But he also thinks there’s a certain
unfairness to the currenttax system,
which he said burdens city residents
more than nonproﬁt organizations,
such as the University of Pittsburgh.

Ravenstahl, who spoke yesterday
with student journalists from Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon and Point Park uni-
versities, said he’s taken the proposed
1 percenttax on student tuition out of
his 2010 budget.

But despite the threat of a lawsuit —

and aloss in state ﬁmding, Ravenstahl
still plans to pursue the tax for 2011.
“I don’t like it, but it’s alast resort,”

~ he said.

He said he’s considered —- and
would prefer — two other options.
One would levy a tax on the payroll
processing of nonproﬁt institutions,
and another would raise a separate
$52 per year tax on emergency and
municipal services to $144. He said
those two options were outside the
city’s control and would require the
approval of the state legislature.

The 1 percent tax on tuition —
which would be roughly $130 for in-
state PittArts & Sciences students and
$403 for CMU students — would fall
into adifferentcategory oftaxes, onea

privilege. Ravenstahl said he chosethis
taxbecause it’s “whatwe’re allowedto
do under the law.”

And he has some support.

Five of the nine Pittsburgh City
Council members — the number
needed to pass the tax — said at a
press conference yesterday mom-
ing that they support the Fair Share
Tax. Those members are Rev. Ricky
Burgess, who represents East Liberty
and Garﬁeld; Darlene Harris, who_rep—
resents Brighton Heights and East
Allegheny; Jim Motznik, who repre-
sents Brookline and Carrick; Tonya
Payne, who represents Downtown and
parts ofWestand South Oakland; and
Theresa Kail—Srnith, who represents
Crafton and Duquesne Heights.

Local college students
protest mayor’s new tax

More than 3,000 people sign online petition

John Manganaro
For The Pitt News

College students across Pitts-
burgh challenged Mayor Luke-
Ravenstahl’s Fair Share Tax.

Their challenge came in the
form of an online petition includ-
ing more than 3,100 signatures
from students of Pitt, Carnegie
Mellon, Carlow and CCAC.

Mackenzie Farone, a Point
Park graduate student who or-
ganized the petition, explained
the students’ motivation for chal-
lenging the tax.

_“College students are a ma-
jor resource to the city of Pitts-
burg ,” she said. “We hold jobs
and support local businesses,

' yet for some reason, Ravenstahl

views us as a burden.”
Ravenstahl outlined the “Fair
Share Tax” during a Pittsburgh
City Council meeting on Nov. 9.
Under the tax, college stu-
dents ‘would be levied 1 percent of
their annual tuition — approxi-
mately $135 for Pitt students in
the School of Arts & Sciences.
The mayor estimated the tax
would generate upwards of $16
million per year, most of which
would be used to help stabi-
lize the city’s faltering pension
fund.
» Farone started the petition as
a Facebook group last Friday. She
sent the petition website to ap-
proximately 800 people around
the Pittsburgh region, describ-

' a ing her outrage with the mayor’s

“Fair Share terminology.K_;
“I wanted to get myjvoice

out there,” Farone said of her
decision to post the petition
online. “I asked myself, ‘What’s

. the easiest and quickest way to

reach out to college students?’
Facebook seemed like the obvi-
ous answer.” ‘

By Monday, more than 1,600
students signed the petition, cit-
ing both economic and ethical
reasons why the tax should be
blocked.

The number of signatures con-
tinued to grow steadily by several
hundred each day throughout the
Week. ‘As of press time Thursday,
3,155 had signed the petition.

Kathryn Tarney, a Pitt gradu-
ate student who signed the peti-
tion, said she believes university
students already contribute their
fair share of money to the local
economy. 1 V

“Please don’t pass this tax,”
Tarney wrote on the petition
website. “The vast majority of

students hold jobs and pay local _
_ income taxes. Don’t double tax us

because we have made education
a priority.”

Pitt’s Graduate and Profes-

sional Student Assembly shared
Tarney’s opinion.

The assembly started a similar
petition yesterday morning.

Daniel Jimenez, president of
GPSA, said the. assembly wants
to help college students express
their opinion’s of the tax in a con-
structive manner.

A “Up to this point, there hasn’t
been a lot of student input to
the city council,” Jimenez said.
“That’s why the council has been
more supportive of Ravenstahl

Elaine Lee and Matt Brittenburg also
ran for board positions. Students could

vote for five out of the 10 candidates, and"
"the eight with the most total votes won

spots on the board.
. Forecasting the success of SGB next
year, Morrison said that he hoped the new
board will be able to take what he has done
with SGB and continue to have success.
Romeo, who lost a presidential election
for the second consecutive year, said he
felt relieved the election was over. I
“Frankly, I was not that surprised by
the results,” Romeo said. “I got a signiﬁ-
cant number of votes, which proves my
message resonated with students. That’s
a goodthing.”

“It’s a fine board. Everyone who ran was

in it together,” Gau said. “I look forward to
working with each of them in bringing the
Pitt community closer together.”

Stieber shared similar feelings.

“Winning was the best feeling. After
standing outside for 12 ‘hours in the rain
and cold, I couldn’t be happier,” she said.
“Everyone who ran put in’ a lot of hard
work.” a

While Stieber looks forward to complet-
ing the projects on her platform, she said
she felt most excited about being a liaison
for the student body.

“I want students to be walking down I

Ravenstahl ( 2

Ravenstahl said he hopes to have
the tax passed by the end of the year

so that the court battle he anticipates -

havingwith the Pittsburgh Council on
Higher Education, which represents
10 area schools, includingPitt,willbe
over in time to collect the tax in 2011.
If the city were to losethe lawsuit, Ra-
venstahl said, taxpayers would likely
have to cover the city’s legal fees.

But some city and state ofﬁcials
think Ravenstahl has misinterpreted
the law.

. Councilman Bill Peduto, who rep-
resents parts of Oakland, and City
Controller Michael Lamb proposed an
alternative city budget, which would
not include a tax on students’ tuition.
Ravenstahl called the alternative bud-
get a “Band-Aid,” saying that it might
work for one year, but the city would
face bankruptcy intwoto three years if
it didn’t tax students or come up with
additional ways to raise $15 million.

Peduto, a student in Pitt’s Gradu-
ate School ofPublic and International
Affairs, said in a news release that he
thinks “the mayor is playing high-level
poker with people’s lives.”

Threatening the city with budget
cuts in lieu of the tax was basically
“holdinga gunto the city’s head,”forc—
ing them to accept the tax, he said.

Ravenstahl said without an ad-
ditional $15 million, the city would
be forced to make “Draconian” cuts,
particularly in the Public Safety and
Public Works departments.

Legal advisers for The Pitisburgh
Council on Higher Education think
thetaxis illegal, said Mary Hines, the
group’s chair and president of Carlow
University.

“We’rewillingtotestitin court ifhe
continues to pursue it,” Hines said of
Ravenstahl and his proposed tax.

Some state representatives think
the council might have adequate rea-
son to do so. The Intergovernmental
Cooperation Authority, a group of
people appointed by Gov. Ed Ren-
dell to oversee Pittsburgh’s ﬁnances,

~ unanimously rejected the tuition tax

Tuesday, saying it doesn’t comply with
state law. The ICA has the authority to
deny Pittsburgh some state funding.

Ravenstahl said he didn’t under-
stand why students have expressed
such strong opposition to the tax.

Tuition rose about 4 percent at
both Pitt and CMU, according to sta-
tistics which Ravenstahl provided.

“I don’t recall an outcry from the
students when these tuition increases
were announced,” he said, adding that
he didn’t know the rationale behind
the schools’ tuition increases.

One student at yesterday’s meet-

ing pointed out that the money from

students’ tuition gets invested in their

respective schools.

Ravenstahl said university stu-
dents use the city’s transportation,
emergency medical services and police
forces, even if their schools have their
own police and emergency medical
forces. He said that he did not know
how frequently students used these
services and that his oflicewasworl<-
ing to calculate that number.

Ravenstahl said he’d be glad to help
students if they wanted to demand
their schools ﬁ'eeze tuition.

He acknowledged, however, that
the area’s universities would probably
resistthat idea, andasthey increased
their tuition, the city would receive
more money from the tuition tax. One
percent of a $12,000 tuitionbill, after
all, would be less than 1 percent of a
$13,000 tuition bill. '

He said that if the tuition taxwere
ever to bring in more moneythanthe
city needed to cover its debt, he would
consider reducing the tax.

Ravenstahl said the taxwould ap-
ply to “any education generated in
Pitisburgh,” meaningthatpeople who
were taking online courses through
CarlowUniversity or Pitt, for example,
would also pay the fee. Students study-
ing abroad, he said would probably
nothave to pay thetax. --

He said the fee would apply to tu-
ition, not other fees, such as health
fees or activities fees, that students
P33’-

He said he would prefer to exempt
students who pay other citytaxes from
the tuition tax, but the city can’t be-
cause ofthe uniformity clauseinPenn-
sylvania’s constitution.

City councilwill hold a meeting at
1:30 pm. today and a public hearing
on the Fair Share Tax at 10 am Nov.
30. Both the meeting and hearing
will take place in the Piusburgh City
Council Chambers inthe City- County
Building, 414 Grant St. Downtown.

Peduto suggestedthat students at-
tend city council meetings, including
those held on Tuesdays and Wednes-
days.
“ tudents should ﬁll the room.
This is the time for students to have
their voices hear ” he said.

Ravenstahl noted that voter
tumout was especially low this year.
This was true, not only for students,
he said, but for much of the general
population, as well.

One student asked Ravenstahl
whathe could do to get students more
politically involved.

“Raise a tax,” he said. “I’m just
joking.”

One Plain Slice

Hey, that kid’ s, . like, smart as

 
 
  

Ben Korman
Columnist

Life is tough for smart kids.

As children, they might be labeled
“nerds” or“geeks” or have theirfaces
stuffed into toilet bowls.

Inhighschool, their acumen might
leave little time for socialization or put
off members of the opposite sex. g

It could also earn them a scholar-
shipto college‘—where conditionsare
more favorableto smart kidsthan, say,
elementary school. In the earlyyears,
the smartest kid in class is often the
least socially accepted and the most
harassed forhis boogers.

This ingrained aversion to smart-
ness, in one form or another, is still
presentinthe college classroom. Thus,
students must arrive at a compromise
between smartness and coolness.

Grades in most seminar-style
classes weighclassparticipation heav-
ily, so contributing insightful analysis
to class discussions is less taboo.

Sure, your classmates mightthink
you’re a nerd, but you’re here to im-
press the professor, get a good grade,
get into your top choice grad school
and so on.

,'..-,...._.4,,,‘ ,__,_.,,,,\,,.,,,,..‘,, ....._... ». .,_.._ -__ ,

A Perhaps if your comments are
astute enough, your professor might
evenwrite your recommendation let-
terwith your thoughtful commentary
ﬁrmly in mind.

Despite all this, the fear of regu-
larly sounding smart manifests itselfin
college classrooms in the form of ﬁve
words: “I was just gonna say.”

This utterance is by far the most
frequent way students qualify their
statements during class discussions.

I It’s a verbal tick, like appending
“y’know” or“rigl1t‘?”to sentences one
expects to be contentious.

Pitt communication professor

John Lyne, who specializes in rheto-
ric in argumentation, translates the
phrase as, “I think I have something
of interest to say——but don’t getyour
hopes up.

“We would all like to have some
rhetorical control over how our com-
ments areunderstood, and conversa-
tional qualiﬁers are modest attempts
todo that,” Lyne said. “When someone
speaks up in class, I think they real-
ize that they nm the risk that their
comments will be taken as obvious
or irrelevan ” C

Professor Mickey Barmon, also
of the communication department,
suspects the phrase is an involuntary

focusing mechanism and that it’s giv-
ing“like” and “y’know” arunfortheir
money.

“The most common situation
involves a lot of students wanting to
comment atthe same time, soteachers
have tocallonthemto keepthe discus-
sion organized,” Bannon said. “They
were listening to someone else talk,
and now they need that second ortwo
to reactivate their own thoughts. But
they’re afraid to let the silence work
because they might think that, since

theywere askingto be called on, they
ought to have somethingto say.”

Barmon estimates that four out of
ﬁve students who aren’t the ﬁrst to
be called on in a given discussion will
preface their comments with “I was

just 3011113533’-”

The phrase illustrates our dual-
ism as collegiate organisms. In the
classroom, our words and actions are
evaluated by two distinct audiences:
our peers and our professors.

The phrase thus serves as a means
forusto let our teachers know thatwe
are smart but also let our classmates
know that we’re not that smart — we

just kinda say things inclass because,
you know, class participation’s part
of the grade, and we don’t wanna fail
or nothin’.

Folk album is all that and a basket ofpeaches

Laura Veirs draws inspiration from farmers’ markets and family cat

Inspiration comes from odd places
sometimes.

For folk singer Laura Veirs, inspi-
ration for her newest album came
from a simple box of peaches sitting
on a table at a farmers’ market.

The words ‘fluly Flame” written
on a cardboard sign caught her eye,
struck a chord and inspired her to
write what she believes is her stron-
gest album yet.- ‘

“You’ll notice, actually, if you look
atvarieties of peaches and apples and
fruits, thatthey’re really cool creative
names,” Veirs said. She went on to
write a song and album titled after
thosejuly Flame peaches.

]u_ly Fkzme, Veirs’ sixth album, has
a light, airy and acoustic style casual
and is carefree enough to ﬁt right in
with its namesake’s month.

, “Well, it’s more stripped down in
asense. Il<ind ofwrite the songs with

acoustic guitar and vocals in mind
rathertitan aband.That’s adifference,
but it’s the same players that I’ve had
for the last few records,” Veirs said.

Veirs hopes that the stripped-
down, summery album thatwill drop

Jan. lzwillbring some sunshine to the
cold winter months.

“Ithinkit’ll be nice because Ithink
people, especially where I live in the
Northwest, are hungry for the sun,
and there is alot of sun in [the album],
so maybe it will light up the winter
months,” Veirs said.

Winter or summer, Veirs is a bit
of a homebody when it comes to re-
cording.

Every album she’s recorded has
been done out of a studio, and this
time, jug: Fézmewas recordedfrom her
own home in Portland, Ore., where
she lives with her producer, Tucker
Martine.

“It was really comfortable,” Veirs
said. ‘‘It’s likewalk down, make break-
fast and record a track.”

Veirs said the comfortable atrno-
sphere of home is more suitable to
her and her music than the pressure
of the studio.

V “You feel like, ‘Ah, there’s a lot of
moneywe’re spendingonthis, we bet-
ter get it right’ [in the studio], and it

wasn’t like that at all,” Veirs said. “It V

was fun. We have a cat, and he would
run through the living room, and it
was ﬁin to have friends over and re-
cord the record, and it wasn’t high
pressure.” -

For Veirs, the ﬁnal product of
months of recording is just as per-
sonal as the recording experience
itself. Art and music are transferred
more like a gift than ﬁscal commod-
ity, she said.

“Not thatl think I’m this great gift
to the world or anything, but when
people respondwell, they almostfeel
like grateful that I worked on that and
did that and that my ﬁiends did that
together,” Veirs said. “That’s howl
feel when I experience great music
or art.”

With that philosophy in mind,

i Veirs feels that those hours of hard

work and pushing through songwrit-
ing blocks are ultimately worth the
ﬁnal product.

“It’s not justaselﬁsh pursuit. It ac-
Uually impacts people, and theylike it,
and it makes adifference inthe world,
and when I think about it, I deﬁnitely
feel it was worth it,” Veirs said.

_ Pittsburgh folk fans can catch a
preview of jug: Flame this Saturday at
Club Café in the South Side.

Stepping into The Toonseum, you
are greeted by an abundance of color.
White walls, accented with teal and
canary-yellow, abrightred ceiling and
a lime-green hall add to the childlike
feel. A huge projector screen hanging
from the ceilingplays vintage cartoons
inblackandwhite. Aﬂatscreento your
left plays more modern cartoons as
you pay your $4 admission fee — a
 price to be reintroduced to your

childhood. g

The Toonseum, Pittsburgh’s brave
blend of museum and cartoon art,
opened last weekend for those with a
sudden urge to be a kid again. Once a
part of the Children’s Museum ofPitts—
burgh, The Toonseum moved Down-
townto1>iuEsburgh’s Cult11ralDistrictto
add its diversity of arts to the already
plentiﬁil selection.

The current exhibit, titled “En—
chanted Drawings: A Century of Ani-
rnation,” runsthroughjan. 3.Itfeat11res
original animated pieces dating back
from the ﬁrst animated character,
Gertie the Dinosaur, to more modern
pieces of SpongeBob SquarePants and
even a Barack Obama caricature.

“Cartoons cross generational bar-
riers,” Joe Wos, executive director of
The Toonseum, said. “There is an op-
portunity for grandparents to share
favoriteslikeLittie OrphanArmie,while

kids share SpongeBo .” ~
Wos, who wore aPopeye the Sailor
necktie to the museum’s opening, said

 

Cartoons cross
generational
barriers.

Joe Wos

that his passion for cartoons extends
back to childhood when he used
to “draw cartoons on his bedroom
wall.”

Isaac Fisher, Pitt sophomore and
cartoon enthusiast, agreed with Wos

. when itcametothe enduringpresence

of cartoons and the role they play in
regard to family.

“Comic books and cartoons were
a medium through which my brother,
sister, father and I all bond ,” he
said.

He hopes the same will happen in

otherfarnilies thatvisitTheToonseum,
“allowingforthe sharingof stories and
memories,” he said.
’ Each piece of artin The Toonseum
tells its own story, reveals new heights
of artistry and allows forreﬂection of
the good old Saturday mornings in
front of tlie TV, watchingthe cartoon
line up. '

“There is no student at [Pitt] who
could say that [cartoons] didn’t play
a role ir1 their childhood,” Fisher said,
stressing that cartoons aren’t limited
to TV. He encouraged students at the
Pitt to check out The Toonseum for

museum

themselves.

The Toonseum is not only a place
to look at cartoons and reminiscence,
butit’s also aform of delayed education,
Wos said. “InEurope andAsia, 
areahighlyregarded artform,” he said,
addingthatthe U.S. is justbeginningto
recognize the cartoon arts.

“We don’t realize how much of an
inﬂuence cartoons play in our current
lives,” Fisher said.

Fisher included political satire and
currentﬁlm in his list of inﬂuences.

“Cartoons area perfect mediumto
express complex and intricate philoso-
phies and ideas,” he said.

As for the museum aspect, which
should not be forgotten, Wos said tlgﬁ
The Toonseum is a stepping stone in "
getting children to appreciate other
museum experiences. Adrnissionis $3
for children over the age of 5 and free
for those below 5 years of age.

‘New Moon’ set to have fans howling for more

N Kieran Layton
AEIE Editor

“The Twilight Saga: New Moon” _
Starring: Kristen Stewart, Robert
%ttinson, Taylor Lautner

Director: Chris Weitz

Studio: Summit

Grade: B+

In “The Twilight Saga: New
Moon,” the female protagonist Bella
Swan —- played by the ever-awkward
Kristen Stewart— is said to “nmwith
vampires.” After this second install-
ment in the phenomenally popular
teenage vampire series, however, it
mightbe morethan just obsessedfans
ad preteen girls running with the
“Twilight” craze.

By cutting down on the absurdly
melodramatic romantic dialogue and
stiff actingthat plagued the ﬁrst ﬁlm,
“New Moon” makes itself more ac-
cessible, interesting and enjoyable,
even if some ofthefunis derived from
gently pokingﬁm at it.

The story picks up a few months
after “Twilight” — Bella and Edward
Cullen (Robert Pattinson) are dating,
and for once, everything seems to
§erfect, or at least until a violent
event at the Cullens’ home on Bella’s
birthday. Ifyou think you get a little
lightheaded at the sight ofblood, wait
until you see this family.

After that, a series of events occur,
but it would be ﬁitile to give the plot
any more exposition. To the fans who
have already read the book: Be pre-
pared for satisfaction, for the movie

is a near—perfect adaptation. To every-
one else whowill still brave the hordes
offans to see whatallthe fuss is about:
Spoilingthe movie would be wringing
out much of its fun factor.

Of course, if you’ve seen the nailer,
you know that there are werewolves,
an insanely rippedjacob (Taylor Laut-
ner), ghost images and acreepy vam-
pire Dakota Fanning warning some-
one, “This might hurtjust a little.”

One massive improvement that
“New Moon” makes over the ﬁrstﬁlm
is, ironically, the inclusion of elements
that render the plot and characters in
amore realistic fashion. After Edward
leaves the ﬁlm for a solid 45 minutes,

Bella and ]acob’s friendship is given‘

top priority on screen. Finally, an
aspect of teenage life is portrayed to
which the youthful audience can di-
rectly relate — the gray area between
friendship and romance.

It is in Stewart and Lautner’s
scenes together that the shift in act-
ing is most visible. These two actors
—— and the cast as a whole — have
shaken off the stiffness that plagued
their roles in the ﬁrst ﬁlm, and with
its new and natural sheen, “New

*Moon” offers a viewing experience
that the ﬁrst ﬁlm warded off with its .

awkwardness.

For those wholly sick of the Bella-
Edward—Jacob love triangle, don’t fret:
There are some seriously awesome
set pieces that practically pop off the
screen with energy and sexiness.

Remember the coolbaseball scene

from the ﬁrst movie? There are at

least three sequences in “New Moon”
that trump it. A particularly rousing

one involves Bella taking a dive from
acliffjuxtaposed with the werewolves
hunting Victoria (the now—deposed
Rachelle Lefevre).

“New Moon” also gets rightwhat
many other similar ﬁlms overlook:
the music. Seriously, the soundtrack
to the ﬁlm is so perfectly matched to
every scene, and on its own, the music
warrants multiple repeated listens.

Of course, the movie remains bur-
dened by problems that are not just
speciﬁc to the ﬁlm, but to the series
overall. There is plenty of pandering
to a teenage girl audience, and the

Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson)

instinctual groaning at overwrought

scenes comes quickly and frequently.

Also, the ﬁlm skirts over concepts of
the series’ mythology that might leave

viewers slightly perplexed at the ﬁlm’s

conclusion.

Yes, the entire “Twilight” phe-
nomenon is still silly —— even the fans
are beginning to recognize that now.
Yet it’s still refreshingto see a piece of
mass entertainment that takes no lib-
erties with its own success. Director
Chris Weitz could have easily made a
ﬁlm that would perform just as admi-
rably while being half as entertain-

ing (and yet still gained a freakishly
intense following). “New Moon” is a
reminder that directors are capable of
infusing creativity and liveliness into
ﬁlms predestined to make countless
millions (David Yates and the sixth
“Harry Potter” ﬁlm, take note).
Ultimately, the haters will contin-
ue to hate, and the fans will continue
to swoon. And forbetter orforworse,
“New Moon” proves vampires will
continue to feed on pop culture for
at least another year.
Now when does “True Blood”

come on again?

Gleason makes mediocre ‘Dissonance’

Newest EP is devoid of emotion but bursting with bland lyrics

The Dissonance

Label: Fluxure Advanced Motion
Media, Inc.

Rocks Like: A grown-up Backstreet
Eey

Grade: C-

Brett Gleasonwas spot—oninnam-
ing his new EP The Dissonance.

The album is inharmonious and
tense in composition and style.

The entire album revolves around
taking acoustics and revampingthem
into electronic keyboard mixes. It’s
an interesting — if not necessarily
good —— idea, but it’s done poorly.

/

The end result sounds urmatural and
forced.

There is no accurate way to de-
scribe the music. Is it electronic?
A failed attempt at rock? Maybe
both?

The vocals seem to get a bit of a
makeover through the synthesizer,
making the overall feeling of the al-

 

bum even more unnatural.

The vocals are average, striving
to hit the notes rather than convey
any emotion. And where’s the emo-
tion and passion within this melting
pot? '

With lyrics like, “Nothing comes
when you need it to / When one thing
goes wrong here, what I often do /
Give up the hope to achieve it,” this
isn’t exactly upliﬁing music.

But with the lack of emotion,
these lyrics are just bland. If the lyr-
ics have to be depressing, the vocals
should be emotionally depressing
to match.

Nothing on this album seems
to mix well, and with its separate
components clashing, it looks like
the album is the one that’s “Futile
& Fooled.” ,

Ashton Gibbs did it again.

J The sophomore guard led Pitt (3-0)
to a 71-60 wir1 over Eastern Kentucky
last night. Itwashis second consecutive
20-plus point game after he scored 22
points against Binghamton on Tues-
zday-
' “[EasternKent11cky] isagoodteam,

— §veryversat:ile,”Gibbssaid.“Wewatched

ﬁlm and knew what to expect, so we
came out with the win.”

Unlike his game against Bingham-
flton, Gibbs scored most of his points
 the paint. He only attempted ﬁve
f-'3-point shots, hitting two, but he was
;8—of—14 from the inside the arc.

I But Gibbs wasn’t the only Panther
:who found success againstthe Colonels,
who drop to 1-1 on the season.

. 2 FreshmanLarnarPattersonscored

E10 points offthebench and came down
iwith four rebounds. Patterson, who
scored all 10 of his points and played

13 minutes inthe ﬁrsthalf, sawaction,
,early as starter Brad Wanamaker ran"

into foul trouble.

“It wasn’t that I needed to show
[coach Jamie Dixon] whatl could do.
Ijustknewthatlneededto stepupfor
the team,” Patterson said. “Itwas early
inthe game, and Ijustwantedtobring

energy.” '
Gibbs played well throughout the
game, but it was a Dante Taylor dunk
with 4:11 left in the game that secured
the victory for the Panthers.

Leading 65-53, the freshman for-
ward came down with an offensive re-
bound and slammed it down for two

points. Taylor ﬁnished the game with ’

ﬁve points, but he led the team with
12 rebounds. _

The shot putthe Panthers upby14,
and the Colonels never recovered. They
came  eightpointsvyithlessthan
a minute left, but back—t0-back fouls
ended any ofEastem Kentucky’s hopes
for last-minute magic.

Taylor and Patterson were two of

. four Pittplayers who came off the bench

duringthe game. Pitt’s bench accounted
for20 points in 64 minutes of play. .

“Lamar played really well in the
ﬁrst half, and Dante played good in the
game,” Dixon said. “Ithinkthis is going
tobeateamthatweplayalotofguys
downthe stretch. It’s goingto be avery
balancedteam as we get going.” .

Behind Taylor’s strength under the
basket, the Panthers’ bench came down
with20 oftheteam’s43 rebounds.And
forthe game, Pitt out-rebounded East-
ernKent1ucky by morethan 20.

'I‘hatwas good news forthe Pan-
thers,whost111ggledtoreboundintheir

“We gotalot of rebounds from our
guards,” Dixon said ‘”I‘hat’s something
that we were really trying to improve

to see.”

The players agreedonthe defensive
improvement.

“We felt, as a team, that we were
playing good defense,” forward Nasir
Robinson said. “Coach preached about
it allweek, so wejustwent outthere and
put our hand up and made them take
tough shots.” .

Robinson ﬁnished the. game with
15 points and came down with three
rebounds. ’

The defense also dominated in
blockingthe Colonels’ shooters, record-
ing 12 on the night.

“It’s abigchallenge,”Robinsonsaid,

‘Panthers host Fan Appreciation Night and experienced Gators tonight

Kelly Flannigan
Staff Writer

3 Tonight’s Pitt women’s basket-
ball game is Fan Appreciation Night,
and students in attendance will be
awarded four loyalty points — twice
the amount for a normal women’s
basketball game —- as the Panthers
recognize fans for their continued
support throughout the season. ‘

The team will also raise the

2008-2009 Sweet 16 banner
in apregarne ceremony for the
second consecutive year.
 The Panthers defeated
North Florida at the Petersen
Events Center on Tuesday 61-
35 in their ﬁrst regular season
game.

A nus Berenato, head
gzoac , was pleased overall
§~'ith Tuesday’s erformance,

hich was a Sc 001 Day pro-
motion. The game started at

11 a.m., and more than 4,000
school children were taken to
the Pete on school buses. The
Oakland Zoo newspapers giv-
en out were also geared toward
middle school students
“This was a double win for

us,” Berenato said. “It was a ‘

win on the court, making us
1-0, and asfar as the School
Day promotion, it was a good
display of athletics and aca-
demics. That’s what we are all
about.”

Chelsea Cole led the Pan-
thers in scoring against the
Ospreys with 14 points, while
Shayla Scott and Taneisha Har-
rison both contributed 11.

In addition to the positive
start to the season and the
return of court general and
point guard Jania Sims, this
week brought more exciting
news about the future of the

program.

Earlier in the week, Bere-
nato announced the si ' g of
three recruits duringt e early
signing period: forward Kyra
Dunn and guards Marquel Da-
vis and Asia Logan.

“I think it’s an exciting and
fabulous class,” Berenato said.
“We’re really looking forward
to ﬁlling some gaps we will
have in the future with these
three great student—athletes
who are all excited to be a part
of the Pitt family.”

Despite this, the team must
focus on the Gators (1-1), who
bringwith them aveteran team
with much experience.

Although Florida lost two
starters from last year in Sha
Brooks and Marshae Dot-
son, who combined for 3,349
points during their four—year
careers, the team returns with
ﬁve seniors this season.

Gator head coach Amanda

Butler didn’t seem too con-
cerned about the key losses
at Florida’s Football Media Day
before the season started.

“Marshae and Sha’s con-
tributions to the pro am go
without saying,” Bu er said.
“Statistically, we’re goin to
have greater balance 0 en-
sively and have quality, expe-
rienced depth, which is some-
thin we haven’t had during
my rst two years here.”

Last year, after ﬁnishing
24-8 in the regular season,
Florida fell in the second
round of the NCAA Tourna-
ment to Connecticut by a score
of 87-59. The Huskies went on
to win the national champion-
ship. 0 ‘

Florida senior Steﬂi Sorens-

almost" 40 percentfrom be-
hind the arc as a walk-on last

leading scorer. A

LonnikaThompson alsoi‘é’-
turns for her senior season.
She is the team’s starting point
guard, and she led the Gators

in assists and steals last sea— --

son.

Sharielle Smith, a senirger
forward, led the team in re-
bounding last year and is re-
ferred to as the team’s “front-
court gener .”

The Gators do not lack
height, either. Junior Ebonbie
Crawford is 6—foot-3 and
serves as the team’s center. At
6—foot-4, sophomore Azania
Stewart also gives the Gators a
big presence in the aint.
