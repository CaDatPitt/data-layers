By TQM SMITH

A dispute between Pitt’s Eng-
lish Department and the Adminis-
tration over the recent rejection
of tenure by FAS Dean Jerome
Rosenberg to three department-
recommended faculty members
reportedly could lead to the resig-
nation of Department Chairman

(Robert B. Hinman.

The rift apparently developed
when Mary Briscoe. Ronald Cur-
ran and Christopher Rawson fac
ulty members in the English De-
were denied in late
April their tenure which would
award them permanent positions,

_despite the strong recommenda-

tions of the Department and Hin-
man. its new chairman.

Only under extreme circum-
stances should the recommenda-
tion of the department be over-
turned. according to sources with-

Offers Color,

BY JAN LLOYD

Downtown Pittsburgh has come
alive with festivity, transformed
from the domain of the hurried
businessman into a world of
gayety, pagentry and cultural
exchange. The ﬁfteenth Three
Rivers Arts Festival opened over
Memorial Day weekend in Pitts-
burgl.'s Gateway Center. Artists
from within 110 miles of Pittsburgh
have their work on display and an
opportunity to talk to the crowds
about their art and their vision’.

Sponsored by the Carnegie
Institute of Pittsburgh and free to
the public the Festival has grown
from the small regional exhibit, in
1960 to a nationally recognized arts I
festival full of a great variety of
visual and performing arts. The
scope of work covered by the
Festival makes it an enjoyable and
interesting experience for all ages
and backgrounds.

The Festival explores a spectrum
of art from high school bands, ‘to
the Pittsburgh Symphony, puppet
shows to ballet companies-each a

then. Rosenberg refused to grant
the three candidates tenure.

Since the decision was made.
the English Department has been
in conference with the adminis-
tration in an attempt to reverse
or modify the decision.

At a meetingiwith tenured Eng‘?

reportedly explained that the
three candidates were rejected
because they have failed to pub-
lish their research satisfactorily.-
Rawson has not published during

It is precisely Rosenbergs log-

which has disturbed the depart-

to many English faculty mem-
bers.

Early Childhood Center  

BY RITA VITOLO

Pitt's role and future in early
childhood care and development
programs is currently under
investigation by a Chancellor-ap-
pointed committee of budget and
planning specialists who may
ultimately recommend a complete
“center” for all the University's
childhood oriented programs.

Tight money throughout the
University is prompting the hard

Israel, Syria OK Troop Separation

' BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Mid East belligerents Israel and
Syria agreed to separate their
forces on the Golan Heights
yesterday in a settlement forged
largely through the marathon
efforts of US Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger.

The peace’ pact between the two
countries, which have been at war
for nearly 79 days, was signed after
compromise had been reached on
the issue of the Palestinian

different type of ‘art and each artist
at a different level of his mastery.

Amateurs and hobbyists join with
professionals in offering this varied

-selection. Juried crafts, an invited

show of painting and sculpture, an
open show for artists to rent
panels, dance, film, theater,
bands, demonstrations of pottery
blacksmithing and
glassblowing andmagicians are all
part of the 1974 Festival.

One of the highlights of this
years Festival is the kinetic
sculptural work of artist and
filmmaker Robert Breer. His very
large unique works are self-
propelled and create many a double
take by frequently catching specta-
tors off guard as the works bump
into them or slowly but determin-
edly pass them by. According to
Breer. his motorized floats possess

posed to mechanical qualityf”

Syria. It includes provisions for a
cease-fire line and a buffer zone
between the opposing forces with
United Nations forces to police the
cease-fire. \ \

President Nixon described pro-
spects for peace in the Middle East
as “better than they have been at
any time over the past 25 years,"
according to Associated Press
reports.

A senior ‘U S official characterized
the talks leading up. to
agreement as the toughest Kis-
singer had ever faced, with
unparalleled tenacity on the part of
the two belligerants, according to
the report. .

Pitt political science professor-
Richard Cottam, who specializes in
Mid-East politics, said the agree-
ment was reached because moder-
ate elements in the Syrian
government prevailed.

A lasting peace in’the Mid East
will result only with the formation
of an independent Palestine state
in the area for people dislocated by
the creation of Israel, according to
Cottam. Some sources look for
creation of this nation on Friday at
the signing of the peace treaty in
Geneva Switzerland.

“I don’t think the truce can last
without a Palestine state,‘ and the
Israelis are afraid of such a state.
It’s a state that will almost certainly
come under the control of Palestine
guerilla groups, they fear it would
be driving" a wedge into their
security along that border.”

Criticizing Kissinger on his
limitation of Soviet participation in
the cease-ﬁre talks, Cottam said a
lasting peace will be reached only if
the Russians are included in
further developments.

Russians out of the talks, riskedthe

YSA Fights Budget Cut a 

BY GENE GRABOWSKI _
The Student Government Board
(SGB) ..last night voted not to
provide programming allocations
for the Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA) next year because of YSA’s

possible duplication of the Black.

Action Society’s (BAS) program.

After studying YSA’s request for
programming funds, SGB’s Pro-
gramming Committee said the
lectures YSA wished to sponsor
concerned viewpoints better ex-
pressed in lectures sponsored by
the BAS.

‘YSA members protested’ the
Programming Committee’s' find-
ings and said ideas shared by both
YSA and BAS did not constitute a
duplication of effort. “We may

have. the same attitude against
oppression and racism, but we are

-two different political groups,”

said YSA mamber Mark Satinoff. '

Satinoff also spoke out against '

the allocation of only $50 for YSA’s
1974_-75 budget. When he called
the appropriation “A real slap in
the face,” other YSA members
spoke up.

Citing YSA’s support of Pitt’s
striking service workers early this
year, and its efforts to eliminate.
non-union grapes and lettuce from
Pitt’s campus, YSA member
Stephanie Brooks said she was, part
of a valid political party. ' “We’ve

programs would be co-ordinated
under a single umbrella-type

The nature of the center is at
present undecided and open-
ended. The Glaser Committee
suggested in their report an
“orchestrative. facilitative" center
co-ordinating teaching. clinical
services, and research for the
adolescent and pre-adolescent.
Henderson has characterized the
center,as a forum where “pedia-

such a center is “to show research

“If you are really serious about
any venture of this kind, then you
must be willing to commit a great

Henderson hinted ‘that the

tion is completed and the written

“I suspect our recommendation
to the Chancellor will be to fund the
center," he said. “The response
from the investigations has been
‘sure. the_University ought to be

Henderson conceded there is a

Cottam said the present Israeli
government might allow the
Palestine state to be made out of
parts of the Gaza strip and holdings
along the Suez but that the Golan
Heights may not be conceded.

“To accept a Palestine state
would take a courageous govern-

irregularities in the President’s

pressure on the Congress from the
people, but on the other hand,

The defendents have until June

Richard M. Seeburger, professor
of constitutional law in Pitt's School
“is ,a
publicity gimmick. There's no such
thing as suing to set aside a
presidential election once the
results have been certified."
Three ways in which Nixon and
those working for his re-election
allegedly conducted a fraudulent
campaign are detailed in the
lawsuit.’ The_ first charge is misuse

of government agencies to gain_

campaign contributions and sup-
port. '
Secondly, the suit cites efforts by
Nixon forces to silence opposition,
and ﬁnallyi—it charges Nixon used
government power in his campaign
to misrepresent actions takeniby
him during his ﬁrst term in office.

reports were confirmed last night‘

I by Associate Professor of English

James Knapp.

-“Hinman said he sees no course
for him but to resign°if the admin-

istration goes ahead with the de-

cision and if there is not a com-
promise." Knapp said. "Neither
Hinman nor Provost Smith would
confirm or deny the reports of
Hinman's possible resignation.

English faculty members ‘offer-
ed comment about the qualifica-
tion of publishing as criteria for
rejecting the tenure of the three
candidates. Mary E. David. Asso-
ciate Professor of English. said.
"It seems sort of ridiculous. It‘s
not supposed to be that ‘way.
There are other standards by
which you‘ gain promotion."

According to the Pitt Faculty
Handbook, excellence in teaching.
-research, and community service
are criteria for judging tenure.

"One thing that is at issue is
the principles involved." argued
Philip Wion. a tenured English
Department member. “Different
sorts of excellence ought to be
recognized and for the. .-Adminis-

after the 1972 election.

If the lawsuit is successful, the
’72 election would be declared
invalid, Nixon and Ford would be
charged with unlawfully occupying
their offices, and injunctions would
be issued, both to restrain ,Nixon
and Ford from acting as if validly in
office and to prevent other Federal
employees from complying with

- their orders.

In addition, the suit asks that
each of the 8,000 plaintiffs be paid
$50,000 to “compensate for
violation of their right to a free
election," and that the defendents
be forced to explain “by what
authority they feel they are lawfully
in office."

-The Committee to Set Aside the
Election claims “the oil, food and
other lobbies were the real winners
in 1972," and goes on to say that
“in ﬁling this lawsuit, we aim not
only at removing Nixon and Ford
from office, but also at defending
our democratic rights against the
‘corporate forces which threaten the
freedom of each of us." .-

 A Poor Showing .2

Despite last night’s showing of six members, Pitt’s undergraduate
Student Government is suffering a poor attendance record, indicating
that the Board is not fulﬁlling its obligation and responsibility to the

. student body at large. '

Aside from the general responsibilities, such as acting out their roles
on various University committees and task forces, the Board has a
speciﬁc duty to attend regular meetings. The voicing of opinions and

casting of votes at these meetings are the factors which ultimately ,

determine policies which govern Pitt students.
Inthelasttlneeweeks, for example, the Board has made decisions

umceming such wide ranging  important subjects_a§:_ Towers
security,momassignmentsforstudentorganizationsintheStudent

Union, budgeting of Homecoming, 1974, renlmeration for student
leaders, andthefimdingofacampusI"Mradio station. It is essential
that all seven elected representatives of the students do their official
dutyandtakepartinthediscussionswhichleadtotheseimportant

I I decisions.

Furthermore, it is at these meetings which Board members give
individual reports on a subject they had pursued independently but
under the guidance of the Board. In these reports and ensuing

- -discussions, Board members participate in the vital learning and

I

communicating of important issues concerning the campus. This
discussion is important if the Student Government is to be inquisitive,
demanding, helpful, and ultimately successful.

However, a close attendance check of the Board’s Spring Session
meetings, six in all, reveals that the Board only twice has had more
than four attending members, and once had a meeting cancelled
because of poor attendance, or as one member put it, “lack of
interest.” _

Three Board members have steadfastly attended the Spring Session

» meetings: President Mike Furick, Bruce Keeler, and Kim Loan. But

the other four members, Pat Kablach, Paul Hertneky, Ruth Weinbrom
and Mary Heider have each missed between two and ﬁve of the six
scheduled meetings. '

We consider the actions of the lackadaisical Board members to be a
reckless accounting of their responsibility’to the students who elected
them. The job description of a student government representative is

. such warranting unlimited energy and devotion to the task, not the

mediocre attention it now receives. We deplore the [actions of those
student representatives who accepted the responsibility at their

, inauguration last January and have not met the challenge sincerely and

' dutifully.

Finally, we urge President Furick, who has had a good attendance
record himself, to admonish his associates and to demand they play
their necessary and supportive part in the functioning of Pitt’s student
government. I

Security

Editor:

.I read the statements made by
various SG members regarding the
new Towers’ security system with a
great deal of misgiving. As a
resident of the Towers. I feel the
st-udents need all the protection
they can get. This feeling was
intensified by an incident that
occurred late Saturday afternoon.
My neighbor had just left the
elevator (which stops at every floor.

following her out of it suddenly
grabbed her purse and ran.
Neither the thief nor the purse has
yet been found.

If incidents such as this happen
in spite of increased security, whai
risks would be run in decreasing it?
Longwell and Furick needn't worry
since they don’t live here. But I
would much rather tolerate a little
inconvenience than increase the
risk of being robbed.

With hand guns

 

An Incestuous Love Affair

BY TOM SMITH

A woman heard strange noises
outside her home. She grabbed a
gun and fired through the front
door. The woman had accidentally
murdered her husband. She was
charged with manslaughter.

A mother had a violent argument
with her 17 year old son. As he ran
from the house she grabbed a gun
from the kitchen drawer and ﬁred it
at the fleeing son. Because of his
loyalty to his brother. her 14 year
old son’ stepped between the
mother and the older son. She shot
him through the head. killing him
instantly. The mother wascharged
with first degree murder.

These two incidents actually
occurred in the city of Detroit.
They are not isolated incidents but
they occur daily. They occur
because governmental officials
have ignored the real reason for the
existence of increasing violent
crime in society, and that is the
easy accessibility of handguns. *~

After the racial riots in 1967
which rocked Detroit and shocked
the nation the number of house-
holds in that city owning guns
increased rapidly. Today in Detroit
guns are owned at an average of
one per household. .

The reason for owning a gun in
Detroit ' is quite typical. A

household owns-a gun for
protection from intruders. Even
Coleman Young, the mayor of
Detroit, maintains a gun in his
household for this reason.

But no longer are the guns being '

used against intruders. Now they
are being used against members of
one’s family during the emotional
moments of violent arguments
simple misunderstandings and
even fear.

Psychologists argue people
would not kill members of their
family if they did not have such
easy access to guns.

It takes only a few seconds, they
say, for tempers to calm or fears to
ease. Yet in less time a wife can
accidentally kill her husband, or a
mother can reach for a gun and
shoot her son. '

As long as American society
maintains its incestuous love affair
with guns, violent crimes such as
shootings, involving friends, rela-
tives, and strangers will continue to
increase. They will increase to the
point at which no citizen of any
urban area will be safe to walk the
streets or even live what could be
labeled a normal life. .

Detroit is a fine example. By 8
pm the streets of Detroit are
barren. If not for the modern
buildings and the cemented

streets, Detroit could pass for a '

ghost town in the olden days of the
wild West.

' A convention center constructed
in Detroit houses not only meeting
rooms but a department store,
room aceomodations, restarurants,
and ‘other entertainment facilities.
In this way a convention visitor
never has to leave the hall and
never has to risk the horrors of
walking down the streets of a
populous American city.

The problem is quite clear, but 1.;

then so is the solution. The
American infatuation with guns
must come to a conclusion unless
we the citizens of, urbanized society

' intend to live not only in fear of the

criminally oriented stranger, but
also the family which lives next
door, a wife, or a brother.
Certainly. the pursuit of hap-
piness in life, the function of
humanity, is not fulﬁlled when

niankindmust survive in a state of

constant anxiety.

If this condition ever were to
characterize the nation, then,
maybe it would be time for all of us
to start shooting each other so
mankind could be free of a gun
lovin‘g society, which seeks to make
man the victim of his ability to
determine his own fate. ~.

After all, they are now doing
precisely that in the city of Detroit.

waste." A then—obscure news
reporter gained national recogni-
tion by retorting. “I do that every
day."

.In 1987: The French national
power company borrowed 50,000
kilowatts from the German national
power company. This established

the “energy standard" for interna-
tional currency exchanges, sound-

. in g the death knell for the outdated

gold and silver standards.

In 1993: Abbie Hoffman died
and was buried in a stolen casket.

In 1999: The largest multiple
birth in history occurred when
Della Hotchkins gave birth to
eleven boys. The father, Benjamin
Franklin Hotchkins remarked,
“Now I have my own football
team," whilethe mother's only
comment was “I should have
danced all night."

In 2008: After a 34 year search
police authorities caught Patricia

the Symbionese Liberation Army.
Ms. Hearst was caught while
attempting to steal a frozen turkey
from a Beverly Hills supermarket.
Her intent was to donate the turkey

‘The Pedestrian’ in early review

-Thursday, May 30, 1974  lii’ITTiNEWiS+‘-Pa’g'e' 5:

 

Germany's Supposed ‘Kane’ Warlul Heart Striker

BY M. C. PILECKI

Foreign ﬁlms take an uncom-
monly long time to reach Pitts-
burgh. With only a few exceptions,
domestic product usually plays our
fair city within a month of its New
York premiere.

But unless it's a “major" film
released under the protective wing
of some American studio, the good
foreign-language ﬂicks take just
about forever to make it here, if
they ever do.

After waiting, and more waiting,
The Pedestrian, touted as Ger-
many’s answer to Citizen Kane,
has - ﬁnally opened.‘ international
star Maximillian Schell wrote,
directed, produced and even has a
small role in this 1973 Best Foreign
Picture nominee.

The story's “pedestrian" is
Heinz Geise (Gustav Rudolf Sell-
ner), a highly respected and
inﬂuential industrialist of the West
German republic. Almost “out of
the blue," a newspaper_decides to
investigate Geise’s involvement in
the massacre of a Greek village
during that monument to human
insanity, World War Two.

It makes for a‘ rather interesting
study. Germany, as you're sure to
recall, “lost” that particular war,
although the film argues it was the
losing of that war which made it the
great nation it is today. The
German mark is one of the world's
soundest currencies and the
country is now a respected
international state.

But there still exists a “common
guilt,” or at least a ' “common
shame" as the ﬁlm puts it, among
Germans,who lived through that

terrible madness. The post-war
purge known as the war-crimes
trials created an odd dilemma for
the sound German: if he was loyal
to his country, he was considered a
traitor to mankind. Patriotic
Germans who “did their duty" in
the armed forces bore a guilt
heavier than their Allied counter-
parts.

Even though the Allied side‘

won’t admit it, history records that
“the good guys” often behaved
just as badly as the German “war
criminals.” A war atrocity is
something committed only by the
losers. The winners get to write
the history.

The latter is a point the film

‘makes so very subtly when it

mentions the Calley case and all
the “little luxuries” he received
after being found guilty of essen-
tially the same crime that Geise, is
accused of. But with Geise it is
sure to ruin his life, his family and
his career. His wife knows him as
the moral-minded man who saved
many lives during the war (and has
lettersto prove it). Plus he is one
of the most inﬂuential men in the
country, a man seen with all his
nation's leaders right up to and
including then-Chancellor Willy
Brandt. *

As Geise points out, if one would
dig into the wartime past of almost
any German leaders one would find
some sort of scandal comparable to
his. So why is he being singled out
for investigation? No reason at all,
except, as the aggressive young

newspaperman puts it, “It will
make a good story." A rather
appropriate line of reasoning,

' that day in Greece.

considering the entirely absurdist
strain of war and its accompanyin
“atrocities." .
Actually, the 65-year-old Geise
has enough things to worry him
without a bunch of muckrakers
digging up ancient history. First of
all [to partially explain the title], he
is attending traffic school, follow-
ing the loss of his driver’s license.
He was driving when an accident

“under mysterious circumstances” "

[so mumble the muckrakers] takes
the life of elder son Andreas
[Schell], who continues to haunt
the old man.

Plus there's younger “hippie"
son Hubert who doesn’t relate to
the war experience’, a young
mistress who he fears is unfaithful,
and, the terrible memory of
It seems that
the only real joy he has left is his
only grandchild, Andreas‘ small
son.

The newspaper’ finally prints
their allegations against Geise.
There’s really no proof, just a few
faded photographs and the non-
comittal memory of a couple old
people who would rather forget the
whole thing, as they've seen
enough of it in their nightmares.
And the charges, too, are unde-
fined, ranging ‘from the totally
unsubstantiated innuendo that
Geise himself shot a child, to that
he transmitted orders, to--the ﬁnal,
universal damnation--that he just
stood and watched, and did nothing
to prevent the slaughter.

The film does not--nor can
it--answer the eternal question
“Why‘?" It throws out the usual
excuses--fear, orders, “just be-

cause it's war," and others equally
lame--but it cannot answer. the
question. But it poses the
questions in an intriguing, reflec-
tive manner (not to mention, at
times. cinematically beautiful even
when recounting the horrors),
whose power hits you only after
you've stopped for a moment and
thought.

The film doesn’t try to resolve
the personal guilt of Heinz Geise,
but rather discusses it in a more
universal sense. By the end of the
flick, when just about everyting is
brought out into the open and

Geise ishurled face-to-facewith a
national guilt, he seems to have
come to grips with it, an‘
accomplishment also for Germany.‘ . -

But The Pedestrian isn't just

Rea won the long jump for the

Triangles Take

  F0urthStraight »

BY RON SIEGEL

The Pittsburgh Triangles won
their fourth straight match since
Evonne Goola,gong's return Tues-
day, rolling over the, Houston
EZ-Riders at ‘the Civic Arena
Tuesday, 28-20. ’ _

Still uncertain about whether
she'll be permitted to play in the
upcoming French Open, Goolagong
trounced Karen Krantzcke» in
singles, 6-1, then teamed with
Peggy Michel to snatch ,a tie-

‘ breaker victory from Krantzcke and

Leslie Turner Bowrey in women's
doubles, 7-6.

Illllllllllll|||Il|||l||ll|||T=

the clubhouse is so quiet, you could actually hear a pin drop.
Murtaugh is bafﬂed at’ the performances of his relief staff. He

refuses to label it another in the long line of Pirate problems. But only

because there is too much else to be done first. Like revamping the.

team.

Once able to blast any of the opposition out of the park and get away

with a few errors or shoddy pitching, the Pirate bats are now too weak.
Errors haunt "them constantly and the hit-and-run and stolen base seem
to prefer the smog of Los Angeles better than Pittsburgh pollution.
The days of the heavy hitters‘have been dwindling and for the Bucs it
has spelled out their decline. Change the Pirates into the hit’-and-run,

base-stealing, scrap-for-every-run-possible type of club-.-is it possib"le.‘?~=:..,

Murtaugh, whose responses to questions were mainly the one line

type, was quite curt.

- “You've got to work with the personnel that you have at hand."
Which means--well, either an old dog can learn i1"ew-tricks or a new

lineup card may be in order.

The pitching is here. Brett, Jerry Reuss, Bruce Kison, Rooker are all
names of the present and future to be respected. But the once mighty
outﬁeld is shaky. Al Oliver doesn't like centerﬁeld and has made it
known. Zisk is still fresh from Charleston and needs time, something
that is of a premium to Pirate management and fans alike. '

Stargell’s bat potential could best be utilized in the designated hitter

spot, but he’s against it, Murtaugh doesn't like it and the Buc Skipper I

will probably be dead before the National League gives in and adopts

it, which is inevitable.

Stennet has been solid all year and has shown the success of the deal
which sent Dave Cash to Philadelphia and brought Brett to Pittsburgh.
Dave Parker's return to uniform will be welcomed with open arms.

At shortstop the Pirates are going with inexperienced youth in

Teveras ans Mendoza and that could be costly. But the committment ‘

was made with the release of Dal Maxvill and so far the results haven't

been displeasing.

Manny Sanguillen is not the same catcher who once rivaled Johnny 1
Bench as baseball's best all around backstop. ,

Murtaugh‘s lineup shakeup for the Padre sweep has produced some
remarkable results and has been heralded as the catalyst tot turn the
team around. But you've got to remember who they were playing.

When you think of the San Diego Padres, you think of theiworst tearr_i__
in baseball. Thoughts of the old Washington Senators come to mind.

Just remember thatrthe Pirates are just a nose in front of them. It is

 . questionable that they are a team to turn it around in half a season and
become "a _ Pirate team of "old; V 1 « - -

Although using the reach of her
6-1 frame well, Krantzcke was
unable to cope with the deadly.
accuracy of Goolagong, who broke
service twice enroute to victory.

After lositig service with the
Triangles ahead 4-2, Michel bore

. down with a strong net game, and

the Pittsburgh duo broke the 4-4
tiebreaker tie with a series of lobs
which the EZ-Riders were unable
to cope with.
x ROSEWALL SHI-NES
The match was particularly

encouraging to Triangle player-‘

coach Ken Rosewall, who played
his finest tennis of the young WTT
season enroute to a 6-4 victory over
John Newcombe, the world's
top-ranked player. 
The owner of a deadly first-

‘ serve, Newcombe was unable to

control it, converting it less than
of the. time. Rosewall’s
chances would have been slim if
Newcombe_’s serves were going in.

In addition to his serving
problems, Newcombe was both-
ered by some hostile fans and the
loss of an argument with a line
judge. .

With
Newcombe serving, the game went
into a tie-breaker with a 3-3 score.

Newcombe rifled. a shot to the"
forehand corner of the court, and '

when the line judge ruled the ball
was in, Newcombe assumed he
won the game.

But the Pittsburgh bench was on
its feet instantly,-arguing that the
shot was out. ‘The head umpire

overruled the line judge, as he is ~

permitted to do in team tennis, but
then asked him three times if he
was sure of the call. The line judge
responded three times that he "was
sure of the call, but -the umpire
stuck to his decision, which led to a
long argument from Newcombe. \
The decision went Pittsburgh's
way, and Newcombe lost the final
game'of the set. »

‘‘'If something like that happens
again," said Newcombe, “I'll push
the umpire off his chair." ‘

As to the fans who were razzing
him, Newcombe declared, “There
were about four idiots in the crowd
that the_ other four thousand would
havepreferred hadn't come."

Records
At IC 4A’s

(Continued from Page 6)

“Rich Markley came down with a
sore throat last Monday. He was
real sick and lost out in the 880
trials." Markley’s time would have
been good enough in two of the
other three trial heats. “Very
tough field." Banner said.

Keith Francis of Boston College-

won the 880 in l:47.8, almost a full
second faster than his 1:48.7 which
was the best anyone had run
previously this season. Francis
missed the meet record by just .4
seconds. '

“Our freshman hurdlers did
well, also,” Banner said. James
Sharpley made the semi-finals in
the 120-yard high hurdles. Penn’s
B_ruce Collins, IC4A and Hep-
tagonal champion, won the event in
13.7 seconds, while Penn State’s
Mike Shine and Fred Singleton ran
2-3. _

Collins was responsible for one
of three new meet records, a :50.2
in the 440-yard intermediate
hurdles. Shine ran second in that
event, also, and ran the first leg of
State's meet record performance in
the 440 i'elay trials .Friday.

The other new meet record was
the culmination of a long duel.
When Penn State's Bahamian
sprinter Mike Sands pulled away
from t-he field while finishing in the
440 relay finals, he raised his fist in
a gesture of victory. .

' But in the 100-yard dash, Seton
Hall’s Charles Joseph, a‘ native of

-Trinidad, pointed _derisively at

runnerup Sands as he won in 9.4,

tying a ‘six-year old meet record‘

which Adelphi’s Richard Hardware
had also tied in Friday’s trials.
Finally, in the 220, Joseph won
by half a second ‘over Sands, a
margin that would have made any
Joseph's

time was :20.5. breaking a 23-year
old meet record. and dwarfing a
field weakened by Hardware's
withdrawal with a pulled muscle.
His point had been made. and he
had become the first double sprint
winner since Villanova's Earl
Horner in I965.

Seton Hall did not run against
Penn State in the 440 relay,
because they failed to file their
entry properly. “It wasn't our
fault." said Seton Hall runner Mike
Tyson. “They (the IC4A) didn't
send the forms to us, so our
runnerswere punished for it. They
should've let them run. Our coach
was really upset." V

Moon said he assumed no forms
were necessary when he saw they
weren't included by the IC4A.

Only five Stadium records
survived the weekend, and one of
those was tied when John Hartnett,
Villanova’s import from County
Cork, Ireland, won the mile ih

4:00.4. He pulled away with a :57.7 '

third quarter, and could have
broken 4:00 with a better fourth.
Teammate. Tom Gregan finished
second. .

It was Hartnett's sixth IC4A
individual title in six. different
events--he had previously won
titles in cross-country, /indoor
two-mile. and outdoor three-mile,

. six-mile and Steeplechase.
- -Another Irish Villanova runner. if

Eamonn Coghlan of Dublin, won
the three-mile run. Coghlan pulled
away from Ron Martin of William
and Mary to win in 13:26.6 and add
the outdoor to his indoor IC4A
three-mile title: ' .

The only untouched Stadium
records were in the hammer throw,
the longjump. the six-mile run and
the 440. All other winners

established new standards. ' ‘

receiver with 30 catches, and
flankers Chuck Herd and Jimmy
Scott. ’

Shumarn's favorite target next
season is sure to be tight end Dan
Natale who scored the only
touchdown in the Blue's 7-3 victory
in the spring game. Natale pulled
in 21 passes last year for 360 yards
while also delivering some key
blocks for Cappelletti. Just who
will make up the remainder of the
receiving crew is still undecided
although Natale will be challenged
for his job by senior Brian Masella

Also graduating from the offen-

Penn State's defense was not hit
as hard by graduation. although
All-American linebacker Ed O'Neil
and tackle Randy Crowder have
moved on to the NFL. The other
losses are linebackers Doug Allen
and Tom Hull, safety Scott
Mitchell. and halfback Buddy Ellis.

The returning regulars on
defense are halfback Jim Bradley,
linebacker Chris Devlin, tackle
Mike Hartenstine. and ends Dave
Graf and Greg Murphy. Junior
John Quinn has been promoted to
Crowder’s tackle spot but
remainder of the defense hasn’t
been set yet. Nevertheless. Penn
State hopes of another outstanding
season will have to rest with their
defense as their showing in the
spring game attests. '

The Lions_should have a strong
kicking game again this fall with
the return of punter Masella and
placekicker Chris Bahr. Bahr, a
two-time first team All-American
selection in soccer, will complete in
both sports again this year.

Paterno will now have some time
to plot his strategy before his team
goes to camp this fall. Some
glaring holes still remain both on
offense and defense and the Lions
will have to find some help or they
just could suffer through their first
“down year" since the 7-3 record
of 1970.
