Roosevelt. Hotel on December 13.
Tickets will go on sale within the
next two weeks at the ticket

‘Student seniority at registration
was discussed and a petition will
be presented to Dr. Holbrook. It
was suggested that students reg-
ister in the following sequence:
beginning freshmen, seniors. jun-
iors, sophomores and then ad.-
V a n c e d freshmen. Beginning
freshmen must register first due
to their program on freshmen
week. ’

A committee was appointed to
arrange a smoker sometime in De-
cember. The shortage of pencil
sharpeners was brought up at the
last general seminar of the Engi-
neers and_ it was decided to pur-
chase them with money from the

Student Block

Enlarged

Thirteen hundged additional
stadium seats were allotted to the
student cheering section by the
athletic board this week, accord-
ing to James Hagan, University
athletic director. '

The new section, Section 13," will
be opened to students for the
Penn State game.

Although already enlarged this

year, the capacity .of the stu-
dent sections has been insufficient
to accomodate the constantly in-
creasing student attendance at the
games. V
Earlier in the season the ath-
letic board permitted the students
to use 3000 more seats than usual
in the hope that the additional
seating would meet ‘demands.
The new section brings to ﬁve
the number of sections now re-
served for the student body. These
ﬁve sections represent  total of
almost 8000 seats. .. '

bands will do combined forma-
tions before ~game—time for the
flag-raising ceremonies. The .two
groups will honor both uni-
versities with special demonstra-
tions before the Panthers and the
Buckeyes take the ﬁeld.

At half’-time each band will be
alloted six and a half minutes and
the Pitt men will be clicking in
their best style to outdo the State
contingent. Under the leadership
of Robert L. Arthur, band direct-
or, and Lt. James D. Hunter, drill
master, many hours of practice
have been put in in preparation
for tomorrow. afternoon's game.

Pitt, OSU Bands Compete
At Half-Time Tomorrow

The Pitt band will be out to outshinethe Ohio State aggrega-
tion at Columbus tomorrow afternoon. The Buckeyes band is rated
one of the finest groups of its kind in the country. 1

A According to Cal Williams, the band’s chief arranger, “The Pitt
boys are convinced that they not only can equal but also can, top
the OSU bandmen.” This is the.ﬁrst time the band willaccompariy
the team to away games this season.

Both the Pitt and the Ohiq Statee

    
  

routine will feature the forma-
tion of the heart and arrow and
the pendulum clock. In another
novel act, the band will march
out a block formation of the let-
ters PITT facing the Pitt stands
and OS-U facing the Ohio cheering
sections.

The 120 band members, the
cheerleaders, and the Panther will
leave Oakland this afternoon by
bus. The plans call for the'Pittites
to return to Pittsburgh Saturday
evening, but in the event of a
Panther victory they hope “to get

Since this is the middle of the
rushing season, it might be well to
gaze on the fraternity situation
at Pitt.‘ This is for the beneﬁt of
those who have never had the op-
portunity of observing fraternities
in action. *

Actually, of course, there is no
“situation”, and the frat men and
women can cite many excellent
features, that their organizations
possess. You have the close bonds
and friendship that can exist only
when you live constantly with a
group of friends. When you have
occasion to travel, you can drop
in at almost any school and find
your fraternity house. In other
words there is always a home for
you. One of the biggest advan-
tages in a place‘ like Pittsburgh is
entertainment. When the house
throws a party, you are always in
on it. And it is a lot more fun to
go to a dance where you know all
the fellas, than to a clip joint

the waiters face if you tip less than
ﬁve bucks.

Another intriguing feature is
the fact that in times like this it
is nice to be able to ﬁnd a place
that is notswarming with people.
If you have to stay out at school
late some night, you can always
curl_ up on the sofa in the living
room if you have missed the last
train home. You can always snag

On the other side of the ledger
are a few things which might be
disquieting to some. It all starts
after you have pledged. There-
are a few clowns in every gang,
and if you are a pledge you are
sure to meet them. You might
have to stand the ’phone watch—-
run errand-s for more helpless
brothers-—and eat your meals in
the house while sitting at atten-
tion. When the house throws a
dance, you will probably ﬁnd

Grad News Makes
Second Showing

The Alumni’ News review, new
off-spring of the Alumni associa-
tion, makes its next appearance
November 19, according to J.
Clyde Barton, secretary of the
group. He claims that this issue
will be “chuck full of alumni news
as well as feature stories involv-
ing the University.”

Beginningwith the January is-
sue, seniors will also receive cop-
ies of the paper, in order to ac-
quaint them with what is going on
in alumni circles. Mr. Barton said,
“By then, those who are to grad-
uate in June will nave earned
their spurs and with them the
right to become familiar with
alumni activities.”_ '

He explained that circulation

yourself keeping the coke ma-

Then, as you pull into the home
stretch, you enter He1l_ Week-—
an appropriate name. Some rath-
er strange things come under the
heading of humor at this time.
You may ﬁnd yourself having to
enter the" house via a rope slung
from a second, story v.1ndow. For
sport you might keep 2 tally of
how many paddles were broken
on you. And if you ﬁnd yourself
taken -on a verboten hell ride, you
will be able to conjure many ex-

quisite ordeals for the perpetra-

tors’.

In all fairness ‘we should add
that, as one fraternity man point-
ed out, hazing will be at a‘mini-
mum. The theory here is, that a
battle scarred veteran might take
affront if some squirt gets rough,
and rebel to the point of bashing
said squirt’s nose in. This would
be an unfortunate situation, and
might well serve to keep all but
the biggest brothers from getting
playful. 

So it’s as broad as it is long,
and if youidon’t get tapped, don’t
worry. People will still talk to
you, occasionally.

Mililto

by Bill Catrow and Ursula Hallo:-an

Pittpourii without representa-
tion is tyranny! From every quar-
ter comes the hue and cry for de-
mocracy in this makeshift‘ col-
umn. .

Being gullible by nature-—with
a ﬂair for the radical—-we scoured
the less frequented nooks of the
Cathedral. We burst into locker
room ,3 and its ~ perpetual crap
game, sneaked a look into sub-
basement broom closets —— even
once around the Commons room--
went in search of new names for
What is usually called “that dirt.”

It was an experience. In our
ramblings we discovered Miss
Panther of 1946 (Peggy Ham-
mond) who makes Tuck shoppe
hours‘, stimulating for the Pitt
eleven. _

Next we came upon Law-studes
Bill Copeland, Dan Cannon and
Dick Harmon who tell us they’re
still “looking”—and listening?

And after interviewing Betty
Jane Redmond for a freshman’s
opinion on politics, econ and
crowded conditions, we were cha-
grined when she asked if we had
any more impertinent questions.
There’s a smart aleck in every
class!

We were beat! Every way we
tu‘rned—n_othing but smart re-
marks and invectives. So we went
back to the time honored sources
and collected this trivia.

confused; about Ann. Her knack

Sulfamic acid, which

Believing that urea could

treated urea with fuming

was exceedingly violent, and

Another outstanding use for am-

One of the most important indus-

based on the fact that it reacts quan-

Rushing, -rushing, everyone is
rushing! And we still have to rush
around to get our news. But if
you’re interested, news isn’t the
only thing we’re featuring for
this week. The “Under New Man-
agement” sign will be ﬂung out.
It isn’t that we ﬁred Blackstone
. ., . He just gets a bigger charge
out of magazines. Anyway, we’re
still here, carrying on with our
propaganda for the fraternity
world.

It takes a lot of money to get
around in the world, especially if

‘ you sport new houses. So . . .

the ADPi’s are holding a beneﬁt
bazaar bridge (I think they call
that alliteration, out at the Edge-
wood Community club Saturday.
Incidentally, there’s a fashion
show included if you have a taste
for models (And who doesn’t?).

Thirty strong and hefty he—men
are drifting West. No the PiKA’s
aren’t leaving for good, but they
are _attending the Ohio State game.
Maybe brother Ohio—Staters will
break down and throw a party for
the Pitt fe1lows,‘too.

The Kappas are broadcasting
early about the knock-out open-

ihouse they’ll be throwing after

the Pitt-Penn State slaughter.
Seems they’re especially welcom-
ing sister keys from State, also.

The Sig Chis seem to be tired
of their own team. Net result?
They plan to take their rushees
to“a football game at Forbes ﬁeld
Friday night.

More and more and more open
houses. after the Penn State game!

1 It’s the‘ Delta Zetas this time, and

they insist that theirs get special

‘notice. And for some internation-
.z'. ﬂavor the DZ’s add their tea

for students from other coun-
tries. Sunday, November 10, is
the -day.

cial fraternity active at Pitt be-
fore the war, was accepted into

Starts Today .

“What Is the Christian Differ-

sion during the area conference
of the student Christian move-
ment, meeting this week-end at
Camp Cheerio, near Cooperstown,
Pa.

Mary Moss Cuthbertson, rep-
resenting the national council of
the Young Women’s Christian as-
sociation, is in charge of the con-
ference, which is sponsored by the
YWCA and YMCA.

Dr. Edna T. Batz, Pitt YWCA
director, plans to lead a group in
interpreting the World Student
Service Fund.

As a rule, the area conference
follows the local one, w‘~‘ich con-
venes every. fall. Since the pow-
er strike forced cancellation of
the October meeting, this one wil
be doubly important. '

Mrs.- Batz announced, “Anyone
on campus who want conference
experience is welcome. If you've
been a member of a church group.
or a group on another campus, you
are verycordially invited to par-
ticipate.”

A chartered bus will leave for
Camp Cheerio at 5 p. m., Friday,
and return Sunday aitemoon.

Tuesday afternoon, November 19,

the Panther football squad, ‘the
cheerleaders, and the Pitt Pan-
ther will. be the association’s
guests.

The Panther will not be the

tive present. Lena the Hyena is on
her way to Skyscraper U. for the
big occasion and a Pitt man is
slated to dance with her.

Joe Dym and his ﬁfteen “Pitts-
burghers” will furnish the music.
Dym, prominent in Vet's musical
affairs, directed the music of the
“Vet’s Revue” last spring. .

Tickets for the dance may be
purchased for 35 cents per per-

IF and IM Programs Move Into Action

Delts, PiKA, Phi Gams
Are Leaders in IF
Touch Football Race

This season the IF football com-
petition centers between thirteen
fraternity teams. They have been
subdivided into two Leagues—the
National League, comprising sev-
en teams, and the . American
League, consisting of six.

Thus‘ far the Delta Tau Deltas
have been sparked by back Jim
Ludwig. The PiKA’s can attribute
a good deal of their success in the
win column to the brilliant play-
ing of back Jack Gallagher.

The Phi Gams are leading the

I

American league with a perfect

record of three an-d none for a

.sum of six points. The Phi Delts

follow with two wins and no loss-
es for a total of four points.

ther “scatbacks”- sidelined due to
injuries, end sprints have not
been as common as might be de-
sired in the Wes Fesler offensive
set-up. However, when the occa-
sion arises for such plays, the
guards can be counted upon to do
their share of the blocking.

Just as at the other positions,
the guards too have been ham-
pered by injuries. In the Purdue
clash, Bernie ‘   "

A Career Ind Retailing

Retail stores want college graduates for Aexec- .
utive positions. Pitt’s Retail Bureau is one

of the most famous schools of retailing in the

world. Its one-year graduate course covers

the entire retail ﬁeld and leads to a master’s

degree. Classes are combined with paid store

experience. If you are interested in a retail

Arnold, Pa. was also slowed up
considerably after an injury in
the Temple fracas and hasn’t been
the same since.

Coury’s injury, coupled with his
determined will to play, has re-
cently elevated Johnny Kosh, a
third year veteran to the start-
ing lineup. The sturdy Donora lad
owns a 20—pound weight advan-
tage over the Arnold performer
which has acted as quite a lift to
the usually outweighed Panther
front wall. a ‘ _

The most experienced and one
of the most reliable Blue and Gold
guards has been George Ranii, a
senior from Aspinwall. This is
George’s fourth year on the
squad, and although he has not
come up to his last year’s form,
he has proven valuable to Coach
Fesler. '

A seasoned sophomore and a
batch of freshmen comprise the
remainder of the Oakland Orch-
ard guards. Ralph Coleman, who
was late getting into shape, has
recently been found ready for in-
tensive duty. Leo Watkins, Joe
Massey, and Jim Gaspar are ﬁrst
year recruits ofwhom plenty is
expected in the future.

Leagues Underway

Competition in the ‘ Intramural
six-men touch football league has
begun with 40 teams, including

the fraternity entries, vieing for
division honors.

Rain has cancelled many of the
games in certain of the loops but
the Medical school, Dental school,
and Engineering leagues have
opened their campaigns.

The Dent seniors have Won two
and have a total of four points,‘
while the freshmen have won one
and deadlocked another for a to-
tal of three points.

A four-way tie locks the Medi-
cal men’s standings. All four
teams have won one, lost one, and
tied none for an all around record
of two tallies.

F esler’s Memory Book

by Marilyn Pearle
The pages in Wes Fesler’s book

i of memories might well be ﬂipped

back 16 years today. L
When the Pitt Panthers meet the
Ohio State Buckeyes at Columbus
tomorrow afternoon, Fesler will
return to his Alma Mater. But

this time [he will sit on the op- ,

posite side of the ﬁeld, as the
Jungle-Cat coach.

Back in 1930, Wes Fesler was
captain and star
of the Buck-
eye eleven.
Newspapers in
Columbus ' and
Pittsburgh were
h e r a ldin g
a gridiron bat-
tle between two
men - Captain
Eddie Baker, Fesler
the Jungle Cat’s star_. quarterback,
vs Wesley Fesler, twice All-Amer-
ican end. ,

Baker was the sparkplug o

 

‘ Jock Sutherland’s 1930 team. He

was great on defense and pass re-

- nation’s

ceiving and the second highest
ground—gainer. He was the
Panther’s head toe-man, averag-

ing over 50 yards for each punt,
and kicking for the points after

touchdown. Baker was being
boomed for an All-American
berth. A

-Fesler was one of the greats in
Buckeye gridiron history. The
Pitt News, November 14, 1930
reported—-“Fesler is a rock of de-
fense at end, passes brilliantly,
runs beautifully and effectively,
and punts as well as Baker.” The
sports scribes were
again predicting a place on the
All-American team for the O.S.U.
star.

From the opening gun, Fesler
led an inspired Buckeye team to
a brilliant victory over a hard-
ﬁghting Pitt eleven. Baker cap-
tained his team valiantly but the
great Fesler ran,-kicked, and pass-
ed his teammates to a 16-7 tri-
umph. '

Now in 1946 the tables are turn-
ed and ’Wes Fesler will represent
the Blue and Gold.
