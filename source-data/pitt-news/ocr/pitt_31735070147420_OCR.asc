Experts: Law might not
require alcohol citings

‘Philip Bombara
, Staﬁ” Writer

A lawyer, a law professor and an .

administrator from another uni-
versity think that Pitt is incorrect
in its position that Pennsylvania law
requires its police officers to cite all
intoxicated underage students they
encounter.

University officials maintain that
state law requires ofﬁcers to cite
underage students, regardless of

whether they are seeking medical‘

attention. Ofﬁcials at Carnegie Mel-
lon and Temple University, however
— as well as several legal experts
— said the law leaves the citation
of underage drinkers up to the of-
ﬁcers’ discretion, although actual

departmental policies can and do

differ. p
State-_' lated Temple and private
CMU both have amnesty programs
in place for intoxicated underage
students seeking medical treatment.

Chinese
New Year

During a celebration this weekend
that drew more than 1,000 visitors,
loneliness was a common theme.

The Chinese Student & Scholar
Association hosted the Spring Fes-
tival Gala Saturday afternoon — an
event that -celebrated the Chinese
New Year this week. And though
the crowd kept rolling in during the
seven—hour event — which included

’ dinner and a number of performanc-

es —— many attendees reiterateda
longing for their family.

Shang Gao, agraduate student in
Pitt’s school of education and presi-
dent of CSSA, compared the tradi-
tional Chinese holiday with Christ-
mas — it-’s a time for families to‘ get
together. But for many of the Chi-
nese students in attendance, home is
more than 10,000 miles away.

Gao was among 70 people who
organized the event to help students
assuage the homesickness and cel-
ebrate the biggest Chinese holiday.

Of course, it was also something
they expected.

The Spring Festival has a habit
of being sold-out, and this year was
no different. Gao said that the event.
was something that students have
come to expect.

People began ﬁling into the Wil-
liam Pitt Union ballroom around
3:30 p.m. to drink Chinese bubble
tea and play games. '

By the time dinner started two
hours later, the line to get into the

American, students of other nation-
alities attended as well. I

Gao said that the cultural event

Because of China’s growing
prominence in the U.S. —— Gao cited
China’s economy, the second largest

recent visit and a building presence
in Hollywood ——- she said the event
was an opportunity for Americans to
learn more about Chinese culture.
“I don’t think they know enough
about this country,” Gao said about
students unfamiliar with Chinese

’ culture.

But Gao said there was another

incentive for students to come.

“Everyone loves Chinese food,”
she said. '

One box ﬁill of rice, toﬁi, chicken
and vegetables was free for under-
graduate students who registered

The crowd chuckled at that one.

crammed into the room, and about
50 had to stand along the walls.
Linda Rong, a teacher at Pitt’s
Conﬁicius Institute, alternated be-
tween leaning against the wall and
sitting on the lap of her friend.
Rong, who also volunteered dur-

ing the event, said the performances
were similar to those in China.

Each province in China would"

Lawyer, professor: Law

Policy 4 1

These policies state that university policewill
not cite students seeking medical attention.
This differs from Pitt’s current policy, which
does not take into account whether a student
is seeking medical attention; Pitt’s policy 
a source of controversy last semester. '
Proponents of amnesty programs say that
the policy encourages intoxicated underage

students to seek professional medical atten— .

tion when over—consumption has put them in
danger. The programs try to accomplish this
by letting students know that they will not be
punished for a violation of the student code
of conduct if theyiare intoxicated and seeking
medical attention.

Pitt officials have said that ——' according‘ _

to Pennsylvania law —— an on-duty Pitt police

Owen Seman:

allows for discretion  

He added that the amount of discretion
‘officers have varies from department to

department. Where one department might

- instruct its officers to use greater discretion

when dealing ‘with summary offenses, other
departments might instruct their officers to
use no discretion and act uponall that the law
allows them, he said. -

Pitt law professorjohn Burkoff conﬁrmed >

this assertion, saying that although there is
no legally mandated action on the part of the

* officer, officers might be required to act in a

certain way to keep their jobs.

This differs from the previous statements
of Pitt officials who have said that Pennsyl-
vania law requires officers to cite underage
students.

Essentially, when an officer . .
encounters a situation of underage

drinking, there is no specific action  

that is mandated! to be taken by  

law.

oﬂicer must cite any underage intoxicated stu-
dent that she encounters. This diifers from the
procedure followed by police officers work-

ing at UPMC Presbyterian hospital, who are '

off-duty officers hired by the hospital. (See
related story on page 1.) A

Lt. Gary Scheimer of the Carnegie Mel-
lon University police said rules of discretion
allow officers to choose not to cite students
while still remaining within the bounds of
the law.  '

“I am happy we have this protocol,” he
said, referring to CMU’s amnesty policy.. “It
puts student safety as number one, and as it
seems to me we haven’t really had any prob—
lems with it.” A

Owen Seman, an attorney at the Law Of-
ﬁces of Patrick]. Thomassey, a Pittsburgh law
ﬁrm, said the procedure for citing underage
drinking, as a summary offense, is loosely
deﬁned within the statutes. '

“The action of oﬂicers is at the discretion

of the officer on the scene,” he said. “Essen-.

tially, when an officer encounters a situation of
underage drinking, there is no speciﬁc action
that is mandated to be taken by the law.” ,

“There is lots of gray area. Nothing is set
in stone and nothing says the officer must act
in a certain way,” he said. “The statute simply
reads that the officer can take a certain action.
At that point, it becomes the oflicer’s call as
to what to do.”

Robert Hill, Pitt’s vice chancellor of Public

Affairs, said in a paid advertisement in The Pitt ’

News last semester that it is the “responsibil-

‘ ity of police officers to enforce the laws that

have been enacted to promote public health
and safety.” 1 , ,

Hill wrote, “Therefore, when the Pitt police
are called to the scene to render assistance to
someone younger than 21 who has consumed
alcohol to the point of requiring medical at-
tention, they will meet that responsibility by
issuing a citation for underage drinking.”

According to Pitt police records, only
two students have been cited at UPMC Pres-
byterian for underage drinking in the past
two years. However, records do not include
whether students cited at other locations were
seeking medical attention at the time.

Hill said in‘ an e—mail, “When Pitt police
are called to a scene at which an underage
consumer of alcohol is identiﬁed,there is
no discretion on the part of the duly sworn
oﬂicer. Police officers at other universities
may have different mandates that apply under
Commonwealthof Pennsylvania law.”

Hill declined further comment on the

- legality of an amnesty program or police of-

ﬁcer’s discretion, referring back to previous
communications and the advertisement. Pitt’s
police department has referred all questions
to Hill and the Public Affairs Department. I

In Egypt, rioting

Buildings on fire. Stopped
traffic. Police lines. Crowds
of ordinary people advanc-
ing, retreating. Unwavering
defiance.

These are some ofthe scenes
that have recently trickled out
of Egypt, a country whose citi-
zens are gathering en masse in
major cities for reasons that
have absolutely nothing to do
with a sports game.

In case you missed it, a state
of social, political and finan-
cial chaos has enveloped the
most populous Middle Eastern
state since last Tuesday, and as
of press time, the pressure is
only growing. Inspired by the
popular overthrow of the re-
pressive Tunisian government
that ‘happened just last week,
tens ofthousands of Egyptians
are on the streets hoping to
effect similar change in their
own authoritarian country. By
and large, they are demanding
the removal of_t_heir president,
Hosni Mubarak, who has ruled
Egypt since the 1981 assassina-
tion offormer President Anwar
Sadat.

Although threatened by gov-
ernment-backed police wield-
ing live ammunition, military
forces replete with tanks, jets
and helicopters, forced In-
ternet outages and food and
supply shortages, throngs of
ordinary Egyptians don’t seem
intimidated. Rather, they vow
to remain on the street until
their president relinquishes
power, as they chant “Down
with Mubarak.” At least 100

. people have died so far as a re-

sult of the uprising, according
to BBC News.

The Egyptian people are
asking for a government that
more directly addresses their
needs. People of all genders,
colors, ages, creeds and clothes
have assembled, many protest-
ing high unemployment, ris-
ing food prices and rampant
poverty in a nation that once
was dubbed the “Jewel of the
Nile.” ’

is for a reason

Although the uprising in
Egypt might at first seem dis-
tant, Pitt students better keep
up with it as the story contin-
ues to unravel. Why? Consider-
ing recent developments, a sig-
nificant change in the Egyptian
government seems imminent.
Mubarak, in what’s clearly a
last—minute move, fired his
cabinet and appointed a vice
president. But despite vio-
lating curfew, the protesters
are not going home. President
Barack Obama seems to be
preparing for a post-Mubarak
Egypt, calling for an “orderly
transition to a government that
is responsive to the aspirations
of the Egyptian people.”

Whether what emerges from
the smoke of revolution is a
reshuffling of the current re-
gime or a radically new politi-
cal system, the power structure
seems destined to look very
different than it does now. And
given Egypt’s broad influence
in the wider Middle East — it
has 80 million people, and con-
trols the Suez Canal — a major
power shift in Egypt could have
far-reaching consequences in
neighboring countries, and by
extension, for U.S. policy in the
region. As the United States
has given Egypt billions of dol-
lars in military aid each year,
Egyptian President Mubarak
has stayed loyal to the Israel-
neutral Camp David Accords.
But with a new government -
and the emboldening effects
that some analysts are predict-
ing could, reverberate through-
out the Middle East —— the fate
of U.S. ally Israel might hang
injeopardy. , V

Tough decisions lie ahead
for American leaders and the
Egyptian people, and Pitt stu-
dents should stay on top of the
action.

Especially considering
the upcoming Super Bowl,
we should realize that some-
times there are more impor-
tant things to fill the streets
about. I

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

 better beer commercial

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

In this time of turmoil, as Tunisia
continues in its rampant instability,

‘ the Euro does ditto and unemploy-

ment remains high, it’s time that I
wrote a column about the things
that are most important to the ma-
jority of American people.

Beer commercials.

We see them all the time on TV,
especially when there is a football
game on. And with the most Super
of Bowls coming up next Sunday,
we’re liable to see plenty of them.
In fact, some viewers are more in-
terested in the commercials than
in the actual game.

Unfortunately, many beer com-
mercials revolve around people act-
ing stupidly or irresponsibly. Why
this would make anyone want to
consume that particular brand of
beer is beyond me, but as I’m under
21 and therefore don’t know what

_ beer even is, my opinion doesn’t

matter. Normally I’m not bothered
by ads featuring stupid people. But
during the “other” football’s biggest
event, the World Cup, I saw one beer
commercial that was astonishingly
offensive. Around the Fourth ofjuly,

Bud Light had an ad wherein the
Founding Fathers generallybehaved
like the drunken rabble George III
thought they were. George Wash-
ington hits up some ﬂoozy that’s
not his wife while asking, “Hovv’d
you like to be the second lady?” In
fairness, Ben Franklin might have
done that, but with a better pick-
up line. Still, it is in poor taste to
imply that the menwho signed the
Declaration of Independence, risk-
ing their lives, fortunesand sacred

' honor in the process, would tailgate

afterward.

Lest I be accused of having no
sense of humor, I am perfectly will-
ing to suggest some commercial
ideas pertaining to American his-
tory that are in slightly better taste.

This is because I believe beercom-‘

mercials should seek to educate,

not just to entertain. :
First, picture an angry debat

between thebackers of WilliamJen—

nings Bryan and the free coinage of .

silver and the backers of William
McKinley and the gold standard.
The Democrats argue passionately

‘ that farmers need higher crop pric-

es and therefore more money in the
economy, whereasthe Republicans
holler that we need to have money
that is “as good as gold.” The debate

turns nasty until somebody rises
and says, “How about the Bud Light
standard? It can be made freely and
it’s as good as gold!”

Our next ad would take usback
to the election of 1884. A Demo-
cratic orator is ﬁring up a crowd
over the fact that James G. Blaine
has just attended a dinner at Del-
monico’s restaurant in New York
hosted by the nation’s leading plu-
tocrats. The orator will say, “And
what’s worse, my friends, is that
Belshazzar Blaine was able to drink
Bud Light free of charge! What lux-
ury is this man not accustomed to?”
The dinner did happen, and it did
provoke widespread outrage in New
York. Earlier that same day, Blaine
attended a campaign rally at which
a minister blasted the Democrats as
the party of “rum, Romanism and

’ rebellion” which really annoyed
7 many Irish in New York. It just

wasn’t a good day for Blaine, “The
Plumed Knight.” In another com-
mercial, we can have Blaine drown
his sorrows in Bud Light.

One could make an extremely
simple commercial by just having
Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and
Franklin Pierce talk about how
much they love Bud Light. If this

be deemed offensive, another easy
ad is Warren G. Harding discussing
how Bud Light is the olﬁcialbeer of
the White House poker game.
Speaking of Harding, the wide
world of political scandal would

also make fertile ground for TV.

commercials. In a smoke-ﬁlled
room, two oil executives are talk-
ing with Interior Secretary Albert
B. Fall about leasing Naval oilﬁelds

in Wyoming. One of the executives I

hands the secretary a black, bag
ﬁlled with money.’ Fall then‘ re’-
sponds, “Gentlemen, you’ll have
to do just a little better,” at which
point a six—pack of Bud Light is pro-
duced to an exclamation of, “That’s
more like it!”

A variant of this adcould. easily
be adapted to the disputed — and

probably stolen‘"’—..’— ’p'residential ‘ C

election of 1876, where there were
allegations that a member 'of the
board charged with deciding the
election tilted the result to Ruther-
ford B. Hayes. Perhaps we could
run a commercial where there

are rumblingsof restarting the 1 __
‘Civil War over the actions of “Ru-
_ therfraud" Hayes, which are only

patched over when Hayes agrees
to withdraw Federal troops from
the South and distribute Bud Light
while doing so.

Hopefully with just a little more
self—promotion, I can be vaulted
into that corner oﬂice on Madison
Avenue, writing educational and
wholesome beer commercials for
the whole family. And when that

‘ happens, I’ll get rich selling that

Hopefully we can look forward
to seeing some new statistics
being released soon.

I don’t know what the beliefs
are among you and your group of
friends, but for me, that number
seems to disregard the outliers.‘
I’ve had people tell me that their

life to ignore the oh—so—impor—
tant-number. There tend to be a
couple views from each end. On

_ one hand, an elevated number

of lovers can represent experi-
ence and possibly a great time
in bed. Those with a low number
can provide the risk of stage five
clinginess — something every-
one wants to staypaway from. Yet
those with numerous partners

are more likely to have contract-

current lover has had anywhere

from 30 to 60, partners so far,

and these are people in col-
lege or fresh out. On the other
hand, college is still ﬁlled with
virgins, a respectable choice
that requires a hell of a lot of
willpower. I find it impressive
they can stand strong around so
many tempting prospects.
With this range of sexual ex-

A perience, a catch-22 can pres-

ent itself. The age-old gender
stereotypes are unconsciously
embedded in our brains, and it
takes a very modern outlook on

ed sexually transmitted diseases
and could radiate the signs of
issues with commitment, while,
for some, finding a virgin is as
exciting as the Pirates going to
the World Series. As a result, it
has become typical for people to
alter their sexual status in favor
of winning over any potential
new love. _

I find lying about your expe-
rience level ridiculous. It’s like
when you were in high school
and the world ended when you
found: out that your significant
other had dated someone you

despise,or a person who still

was involved in his or her life.’

It becomes blown out ofpropor-
tion, and jealousy takes over the

- relationship. There is no need

for any of that in college. Your
past life, whether looking at
sexual partners or exes, is your
business, and only yours for the
keeping. »

So when that question pops
up, you can just explain that this

is something new —— a fresh start _

— and nothing beforehand mat-
ters. The most important thing
is whether or not those previous
partners have had an effect on
your current or lifelong health,
which is a topic that should
always be brought up between

‘new lovers. It doesn’t matter

how many times you’ve gotten

down to business, but it does _

matter if you’ve received some-
thing unwelcome in return.
That’s information you should
never alter.

Finding new love is great.
There is no point in tainting it
by outright fabricating or un-
derstating your past all because
of a stupid number. It’s no one’s
business who you’ve been bump-
ing with, unless there’s informa-
tion that might affect your new
partner. Just remember, this is
college and everyone has to keep
an open mind. If you’re really
interested in this person, the
numbers should point in your
favor, regardless of those that
add up from the past.

Sarah Simkin
Senior_Sta_ff Writer

Friday, Jan. 28, 2011: The Pitt

~ News entrusts this intrepid jour-
’ nalist with braving the elements

in the name of documenting art
and exploring the depths of the
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s quar-
terly gallery crawl. I enlist the
help and observational skills of an
individual who, for the purposes
of this article, shall be referred to
as Schenley.

6:05: I catch the 61C, attempt-
ing to be fashionably late for the
5:30 start of the art crawl. The
reading on the bus’s digital dis-
play, worrisomely, bears no cor-
relation with our actual location.
I notice a ﬁngerless-glove— and
beret—clad woman three rows
ahead of me clutching a Cultural
Trust brochure and resolve to
simply get off the bus whenever
she does.

6:32: Schenley and friends,
whom I Christen Argentina and
Kentucky, are enjoying the legal
privileges of being 21 at a happy
hour. Lacking such rights, I am
forced to wait on the sidewalk in
the snow for them to ﬁnish their
drinks, because the concierge
won’t even let me stand in the lob-
by without valid ID. Fortunately,
despite my age, I’m still allowed
to attend the crawl.

6:38: Our ﬁrst gallery is the
709 Penn Gallery, which houses an
installation piece entitled “After
the Sky has Fallen.” We’re not sure
what we’re looking at. It appears
to be an oblong cocoon made of
pale woven scrap paper. Schenley
is tipsy and her commentary is
phallic and unhelpful. The walls
are sprinkled with close-up pho-
tos of something organic and
ominous.

6:44: Onward to Future Ten-
ant, a gallery on Penn Avenue. A
television monitor displays a re-
cording of digital flowers. Metallic
letters spell out “POINTLESS” on
a wall display, a sentiment which
resonates deeper than anything
else in the exhibit. A Sega Genesis
is on display, prompting Argen-
tina to muse on how old we must
be for our childhood toys to have

become art.

v6:51: We spot the Goodie_

Truck, an elusive mobile ‘ped-
dler of hot chocolate and baked
goods. .

‘ 6:53: SPACE gallery on Lib-
erty Avenue: A “trading blanket”
display prompts visitors to take
something from its selection of
random pocket ﬁllings and leave
something else behind. We all
rummage for something to par-
ticipate with. _

I am unable to discern any
meaning from an awning covered
with photographic prints; it’s im-
possible to tell art from detritus.
There is literally a tumbleweed
sitting in the corner from which
I can divine no signiﬁcance.

Another display, or maybe a
continuation of the same exhib-
it, featuresa motley assemblage
of slogans, advertisements and
platitudes printed on posters and
ﬂiers — possibly a commentary
on our disposable culture? We
grapple with the potentially ob-
scene meanings of W.T.S.H.T.F.
scrawled on a sheet of butcher
paper and stapled to the wall
several feet above eye level. The
blaring alt-rock that obscures any
attempts at conversation might
be background or might be its
own art.

7:00: Another exhibit bills it— '

self as a “playful investigation” of
craigslist m4w (men for women)

ads. A walk-in installation piece,
possibly some sort of ode to the
speakeasy, features the script “Be
classy. Be discreet,” — words to
live by.

7:05: Argentina,‘prompted by
the projection of footage of what
might be the process of construct-
ing an outdoor rustic hot tub, ex-
plores the possibility of video art
being the new generation of art.

7:10: Le Cordon Bleu Institute

of Culinary Arts, also on Liberty
Avenue, is packed. And those ex-
quisite and colorful coral reefs
are really made out of sugar. From

what I know of sugar—tempering

processes, they look like their

creation was probably extremely
dangerous. A queue forms around
the display to purchase shrimp
bisque and chocolate-chip cook-
ies.

7:15: I tell Kentucky that I have
to try her soup, for the sake of
art — usually I do things for sci-
ence, so that was a new excuse.

She consents, and I also purchase

acookie. The former is marginally
too salty and the later’ is ﬁne, but
unremarkable for a confection
baked by people who specialize

in such things. .
7:36: An exhibit on photo
graphs of invasive plant species
in the basement of the Harris The-
ater, on the same street. Some of

this just looks like poor lab tech-'

nique, but it’s beautiful nonethe-
less, especially some color macro

V prints focusing on the intricacies

of the veining in leaves and ten-
drils of vines.
7:50: A woman beckons us

ugh blankets and sugar for art .

Simkin recounts her night participating in the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Gallery4Crawl last Friday.

through a doorway. We walk
through a metal detector which

strikes me as suspect for an art 0

gallery, only to discover we are ac-'
tually in the Planned Parenthood
of Western Pennsylvania. Which
has a gallery space why exactly?
Several abstract and presumably
Planned Parenthood-inspired or
related paintings adorn the walls,
interspersed with the organiza-
tion’s informational posters.

t7:56: Mixed—media'Marrake-
sh-inspired art is displayed at
Tonic, also on Liberty Avenue.
If I hadn’t known there was an
art creep afoot I might have just
thought the upstairs bar to be
overly decorated —— the walls are
covered in brightly coloredswirls
and patterns of stones, oil paints
and sand.

8:14: I am done with art for-
ever. ’

White Light/Black‘ Light at the

‘ WEEKEND BASKETBALL ROUNDUP

Men’s team narrowly wins, women fall just short

Isaac Saul, Torie Wytiaz
Staﬂ” Writers

Men’s basketball: Pitt 65, Rut-
gers 62

If it weren’t for Ashton Gibbs, the
Pitt men’s basketball team would
never have had a chance against
Rutgers.

Saturday night at the Louis
Brown Athletic Center, the junior
guard went off for a career-high 24
points, leading the No. 2 Panthers

*\--o- to a 65-62 victory in a game during

which Pitt never seemed to ﬁnd its
rhythm.

“I don’t think that we’re clicking
like we should offensively yet,” Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon said in a
post-game news conference. “It was
a physical game and we just stepped
up and made big plays in a game
that we did not shoot .it well.” 7

Those big plays, for the most
part, came from Gibbs, who came
up in the clutch when he hit a

=*='25-footer with 55 seconds left to
give Pitt a 61-57 lead and cap off

the win.

“I just tried to move without the
ball, get to the open area. Gary did
a good job ﬁnding me,” Gibbs said.
“It was a deep shot, I knew the shot
clock was running down. I was con-
ﬁdent and it went in.” A

The Panthers (20-2, 8-1 Big East)
were down 28-27 at the end of the
ﬁrst half and had only three players
who had hit a ﬁeld goal. One was

I if Nasir Robinson — who was 1 for

5 — and another was Gary McGhee,
who was just 1 for 2.

And then there was Gibbs, 5 for

. 9 with 15 points to go along with

two steals —- all before halftime.

in. He came into the game averaging

15.5 points per game.

Pitt spent all 20 minutes of the
ﬁrst half either trailing or tied.
Coming into the game on Satur-
day, the Panthers had only trailed
a total of 18 minutes in Big East play.

“Saturday’s match-up was a physi-

cal game, forcing both teams to
go to their bench because of foul
trouble. ,
“They’re extremely physical,”
Rutgers forward Jonathan Mitch-

I-‘z ell said of the Panthers . “I felt like

Nasir Robinson was in my shorts all
night. He did a great job of using his
strength and using his body to stay

attached to me. Maybe [their depth
hurt us] because they’re rotating in
and out.”

For Rutgers (12-9, 3-6 Big East),
the ﬁrst half was representative of
everything the team needed to do.
The Scarlet Knights were distrib-
uting the ball and had six players
who had hit ﬁeld goals heading into
halftime. They made four of their
ﬁrst ﬁve shots, highlighting their
strong perimeter play, and overall
performed well‘ during the 20 min-
utes in which they never trailed.

The Knights never seemed to
let up, and one surprise player —
Robert Lumpkins — came up big
for Rutgers with 12 points and three
blocks in just 17 minutes of play.

At the end of the day, however, it
was the Panthers’ depth, rebound-
ing and free-throw shooting that
showed why they are the No. 2 team
in the country.

Women’s basketball: Marquette
74, Pitt 70(0vertime)

Before Saturday’s contest, the Pitt
women’s basketball team had never
lost to Marquette on its home court.
The two teams had also never gone
into overtime before.

This weekend’s meeting proved
to be a ﬁrst on both accounts. The
Panthers fell to the Golden Eagles
74-70 in an overtime game at the
Petersen Events Center.

It was also the ﬁrst overtime
contest for the Panthers since they
fell to Syracuse 87-80 at home last
February.

For Pitt head coach Agnus Be-
renato, the game was one of the
best she has seen her team play,
despite the negative outcome on
the scoreboard.

“This was a heartbreaking loss
because we played well enough to
win,” Berenato said in a press con-
ference. “The last 10 minutes and
the overtime was some of the best
basketball I have seen this year.”

The game began close. In the _ _

ﬁrst half, the teams were tied twice
and the lead changedhands eight
times, proving the Panthers (9-11,
1-6 Big East) and Golden Eagles to
be nearly evenly matched.

But Marquette (17-4, 5-3 Big
East) used a 7-0 run late in the ﬁrst
half to enter the locker room with
a 28-26 lead. The run began with a

Pitt’s Shayla Scott puts up a shot against Marquette Saturday afternoon. Scott had 17 points in the loss.

3-point ﬁeld goal by guard Tatiyiana
McMorris, who ﬁnished the game
leading all players with 22 points.

Taneisha Harrison contributed a
team-high 18 points to the Panther
offense, continuing her production
as the leading scorer for Pitt this
season. In those 18 points, she
tied her career-high 3-point total
with four baskets in her eight at-
tempts.

Chelsea Cole earned a double-
double with her 11 points and 14

rebounds. Cole also contributed
four blocks to Pitt’s A10.-‘total.

Shayla Scott seemed to have se-
cured the victory for Pitt with two
free throws which put Pitt ahead
63-60,’ but McMorris was not to
be outdone, and she sunk another
three to force the game into over-
time.

McMorris’ shot left her hands
with 1.5 seconds left in the game.

“You have to give Marquette
credit,” Berenato said. “They knew

they had to make a three and we
were playing great defense.”

The additional overtime minutes
provided more of the same, with
each team trading baskets and the
lead. In the end, the Golden Eagles
came away with the victory.

In addition to Harrison and
Cole, Scott was a major offensive
contributor for the Panthers,
scoring 17 points, including three
3-pointers which came at crucial
junctions for Pitt. I

AN OLTMANN’S OPINION

Roethlisberger a winner

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

 

When you  of the greatest  quar— .

terbacks in NFL history, the names Montana,
Aikman, Bradshaw and Brady usually come
to mind.

 But after the Super’ Bowl comes to an end *

Sunday, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlis-
berger could emerge a member of that elite
°a¥?8°‘Y- , . .

; ‘LAwin against the Packers would give Roeth-

‘ lisberger three Super Bowl championshipsin
hisﬁrst seven seasons in the league — a claim .

thatmost other quarterbacks only dream of.

~ §Yet many people always seem quick to dis-
count Big Ben, saying th:at‘it’s the great Steelers
defensethat’s winning all those championships
and not the quarterback. .. V '

Yes, the defense is good, butit isn’t like '
Roethlisberger is the only winning quarter— ‘ '

back to have a great defense. Bradshaw had
the vaunted Steel Curtain and,Mo‘ntana had

‘ great players like Hall of ‘Fame safety‘Ronnie*

Lott to back him up.
‘Though he doesn’thave the most spec-

tacular statistics, Roethlisberger has proven ‘ '

j time and time again that he is a pure winner.

v Wllether it be his 10-2 career playoff record or

the countless late—game comebacks, Big Ben

. ‘comes up big when it ﬁiiatters most. v C ’

That playoff record-is hard to argue against,
but some NFL pundits say they would still
choose Ben’s counterpart in the Superbowl,
Packers quarterback Aaron Rodglers, over Ro-
ethlisberger. ’ V 7 '

Rodgers has all the ﬂashy stats, throwing
for 3,922 yards this season to go alongwith 28
touchdowns to just 11 interceptions.

But what has Rodgers ever won worth not-
ing in his NFL career? Up to this point, he has
as many playoff wins as Roethlisberger does
Super Bowl rings: two.

ESPN analyst Skip Bayless got it right re’-

, cently when he tweeted, “To start a franchise,

Roethlisberger or Rodgers? This question is
an insult to Roethlisberger. 2-2 in SBowls. 10-2
playoffs. Clutch gene.”

And as for the school of thought that says
that Roethlisberger relies on his defense and
the running game to win, let’s look at some of
his stats from previous seasons. N

They might surprise you.

In 2007, Big Ben threw for 32 touchdowns,

_ putting him thirds among NFL quarterbacks
that season, and just last year he threw for
- 4,328 yards — more than Rodgers has this

season and morethan supposed star quar-
terbacks Philip Rivers, Brett Favre and Kurt

 Warner had that year.

In just his rookie year, Roethlisberger put
on what might be the most incredible and un-
precedented feat any NFL quarterback has ever
managed —he started off 13-0, an achieve-

ment-no other signal caller in the history of

the league can -say. -

Maybe it’s his off-ﬁeld transgressions that

make fans and analysts refuse to accept Ben’s
greatness.

Bayless went on to tweet, “The mariy who’d _

take ARodg over Ben are GB fans or loiie ARodg
b/c they HATE Favre or they consider,Ben abad
guy who got pass from police.” ’

But come this time next week, NFL fans ’ A

everywhere will have to face the fact that Ro-
ethlisberger is just beginning a Hall of Fame
career and, if he keeps this up, might go down
as the premier winning quarterback in NFL
history. I A‘
