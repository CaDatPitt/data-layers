Around the world in one afternoon
Despite rain, International Fair goes on

Lisa Grzyboski
Senior Staff Writer

The ballroom and lower lounge of the
Wrlliarn Pitt Union came alive with sights,
sounds and smells front around the world
yesterday as a host of study abroad and inter-
national student organizations descended on
the campus for the 14th annual International
Fair.

Ofﬁcials from Pitt's Study Abroad
Oﬁice, delegates from the University's four
international certiﬁcate programs and people
from other campus oﬂices dedicated to pro-
moting cultural diversity at Pitt were on-
hand to pass out brochures and offer infor-
mation and advice to browsing students.
Rounding out the fair were a number of
booths offering a wide variety of study-
abroad programs available through other
universities as well as a dozen international
student groups on campus.

The International Fair is only one of a
multitude of events and activities throughout
the week. Students can attend information
sessions on an assortment of topics, view
international ﬁlms, participate in discussion
groups, play in soccer games and savor
international entrees in the campus cafete-
rras.

In recent years, the celebration of cul-
tural diversity in the world and on campus

was limited to one or two days. This year,‘

officials in the Study Abroad Oﬂice, the
Oﬂice of International Services and the
International Development Program, along

with people from other university depart-
ments, worked to expand the festivities into
a ﬁve-day affair.

"The fair in the past was only one day
long, and the Study Abroad Oﬁice only
worked with the Office of International
Services," said Anna Gensbigler, the gradu-
ate-intem adviser in Pitt's Study Abroad
Oﬂice.

"When I started my position in January,
we began working to extend the fair to the
whole week using more of the campus‘
resources," Gensbigler said.

"In the early '80s, there was a whole
week dedicated to cultural diversity, and
then the interest sort of died down," she
added. "We are hoping that this will be the
start to another period of international cele-
bration at Pitt." I

Originally held on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of
Forbes Quad, the fair was moved to the stu-
dent urrion because of the large number of
students it attracted.

"The food, entertainment, colorful
booths and activities attract more than the
students who are interested in study abroad,
they attract students who are interested in
having fun," said Annagene Yucas, director
of the Study Abroad Oﬂice.

Yucas said her oﬂiee intentionally holds
the event in the middle of ﬂie semester to
start people thinking about applying to study
abroad. .

oing from high

tension to depression

College adjustment can lead to
serious problems for some students

Hlllary Stevenson

Staff Writer

It is almost the one—month anniver-
sary of the start of the school year. The
novelty will soon wear off, if it hasn't
already, and the reality of having to be an
adult —— making choices that were once
made by parents, learning to manage time
and ﬁnances, as well as other pressures of
adulthood — will inevitably set in.

And about this time every year, these
collegiate stresses create a surge in the
number of students experiencing bouts of
depression, according to Pitt’s counseling
center.

College students might begin to feel
the symptoms of depression during the
second month of each semester, said Dr.
Penny Crary, the director of Pitt's counsel-
ing center.

"It's after the ﬁrst month that the truth
sets in," said Crary. "Students begin to

realize that this is real. They are away
from home, they are away from their
friends, and they have a workload like
they might not have had before."

Crary said some common symptoms
of depression include a change in eating
patterns, a persistent sense of sadness or
pessimism, and a change in sleeping pat-
terns — either sleeping too little or too
much.

"Just because someone had a bad day
doesn't mean they have depression,"
Crary said. ‘To experience changes in
mood is a normal thing.

"These symptoms need to last at least
two weeks. The best way I can describe
the sensation is that it is relentless."

Another sign of depression Crary
pointed out was a continuing sense of guilt
over something that happened in the past.
Crary referred to this as "inappropriate

A university is a place that preaches the doctrine of
striving for excellence and broadening one’s horizons.
Gerald J. Massey, a professor of history and philoso-

He said

phy of science at the University of Pittsburgh, was award-
ed for practicing what universities preach when he recent-

Massey, a distinguished service professor of philoso

The award was bestowed upon Massey by German

The award is earned through outstanding accom-

said Dr. Gereon Wolters, a University of Konstanz pro-

INTERNATIONAL FAIR

versity students studying or interning
abroad, Yucas said Pitt is looking to increase
the interest level of the student body. By
organizing events such as International
Week throughout the year, oﬂicials have
found great success.

"We had 400 Pitt students study abroad
last year, an all—time high," she said. "And it
wasn't just students studying liberal arts or
students at Pitt's Oakland campus that wen "

As students ﬁltered in and out of the
ballroom and lower lounge, they were met
with the powerful drum beat of the Umoja
Aﬁican Arts Company, the rapid musical
pulse of the Latin dance band Orquesta
Tropical and the striking demonstration of
Thai martial arts.

These presentations, combined with the
smell of ethnic foods wafting between the
booths, were used to entice more students to
visit, said Joan Lucas of the Ofﬁce of
International Services.

"The idea was to make it a more inter-
esting fair," Lucas said. She added that the
University invited as many on—campus inter-
national groups as possible so students could
ﬁnd learn what the groups are all about.

Even though most officials were satis-
ﬁed with the steady ﬂow of students, every-
one remarked that more students would
have attended the fair had it been held on the
union's lawn. A steady drizzle halted plans to
hold this year's event event outdoors.

"We do better when we are outside
because the music and food really attract stu-
dents passing by, but this is only the third or
fourth time we've been rained out, so you
can't complain," Lucas said.

Because they were happy to be meeting
and talking with interested students, most
people manning the booths didn't give much
thought to the uncooperative weather.

At the Center for Latin American
Studies‘ table, Connie Acosta, secretary of
the center, engulfed passers-by with her
excitement and enthusiasm.

"We are one of the best LatinAn1erican
centers in the country," she said. "We have
students coming here ﬁom all over the
world, and the interest is growing."

Acosta said she's seen an enormous
growth in "intemational ﬂavor" during her
four years in Pittsburgh, and that it's now
"everywhere."

On the table before her were handouts
describing Pitt's Latin American center,
newsletters, lists of Latin American organi-
zations in the area and event calendars.

"We have plenty of ways for students to
get involved," Acosta said, pointing to the
stacks of paper.

Jennifer Warrender, a Pitt senior
involved in Students Around the World —— a
campus organization dedicated to promot-
ing cultural awareness at Pitt — agreed.

" I met a lot of my friends at Pitt through
this," she said.

While discussing her own study—abroad
experience in Japan, Warrender touched on
the multitude of choices available to stu-
dents.

"There are many options out there, liter-
ally hundreds. There are so many things stu-
dents can do to meet their needs and to
achieve what they want," she said. "There is
something for everyone, and scholarships
are available.

"I learned a lot of self-awareness and a
lot about my strengths and weaknesses. I
also got a different perception of America,"
she added. "[Study abroad] has to be a deci-
sion you make for yourself. You have to
know the reasons why you are going, and
you have to know yourself."

DEPRESSION

guilt-" . _ .

"People with depression will
dwell on what they did wrong.
They'll have this continued sense
of sadness, and may even try to
change it, but it will still be there,"
Crary said. "They often cannot
think of a time when they didn't
feel the way they do."

According to Crary there are
symptoms of depression which are
more common in college students
than in the general population. She
said these include a diﬂiculty in
concentrating, an increased use of
alcohol and a lack of sexual drive.

"Students will use alcohol just
to feel normal, not even to feel
high,” Crary stated. “What they
don't understand is that alcohol is a
natural depressant.”

Dr. Michael Thase of Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic
said there are three main types of
depression —— manic (also known
as bipolar) depression is the most
common form. In addition, there
are dysthymia and clinical depres-
sions.

Thase said manic depression
is marked by bouts of depression
intenupted by periods of abnomral
elation, a rapid thought process
and excessive risk taking.

"People with manic depres-

sion will have a strong sense of

©WIS

FROM PAGE 1

grandiosity and express their
beliefs in such a way that they act
like God's armointed messenger,"
Thase said.

The symptoms for dysthymia
and clinical depression are identi-
cal, but dysthymia is marked by a
milder expression of those syrr1p-
toms. People who are clinically
depressed or dysthyrnic will feel
miserable for prolonged periods of
time, with seemingly no end in
sight for their negative feelings.

"Dystl1yrnia is different from
the other forms of depression in
that it is not episodic. People with
dysthymia could go from feeling
OK to miserable for at least two
years," Thase said. "[The charac-
ter] Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh
is a classic example of a dys-
thyrnic character."

According to Thase, the aver-
age age at which an individual
may ﬁrst experience an episode of
depression has decreased.

This trend, Thase said,
explains why in recent years there
has been an increase in college
counseling center visits across the
country.

In a series of surveys conduct-
ed armually over the last 15 years
by Robert Gallagher, assistant vice
chancellor for student aifairs, it
was discovered that more college

THE PITT NEWS

students across the country have
begun making appointments at
their school's counseling centers.
Gallagher’s studies have also
revealed that students are exhibit-
ing more serious problems than
ever before.

"In the last 8 to 10 years,
counseling centers have seen more
students with psychological prob-
lems," Gallagher said. "We've
done a good job at showing the use
of counseling centers, but we can't
determine what the reasons are for
the increased use."

Jean Koesel, administrative
assistant at Pitt's counseling center,
said that the center is being used
now more than in past years.
Because of a recent change in the
center's accounting system, she
was unable to provide statistics
regarding how often the center is
visited.

In 1993, Gallagher’s annual
survey revealed that 63 percent of
Pitt's students said they experi-
enced bouts with depression. For
44 percent of these students,
depression interfered with college
work One-third said they would
have beneﬁted from counseling.

The increased use of the
counseling center demonstrates
that depression is a national prob-
lem.

"College is a microcosm of
the real world," said Pitt counselor
James Cox. "The rates of depres-

sion have increased across the
nation so it makes sense that rates
have increased in college."

Depression often happens
more than once in a person's life.
Studies reveal that most people
will suffer from subsequent
episodes of depression.

"We need to recognize this as
a common illness. We get the ﬂu,
we get diabetes, we get depres-
sion," said Crary.

There are also more factors
today that can cause depression
than there were 20 years ago. An
openness in society — with every-
thing from sexuality to everyday
problems —- also contributes to
individuals’ personal problems.

"I'm not sure that there's a part
of society that's free from depres-
sion," said Cox. "At the counsel-
ing center we try not to 
the idea of depression. Most cases
we see here are moderate to severe
forms of depression."

Cox added that students see
him and his colleagues for other
problems, such as anxiety disor-
ders and family dilemmas.

Specialists in dealing with
depression say that people also
realize there are other methods of
treatment besides the archaic form
of institutionalization.

According to Thase, about 90
percent of patients can be treated
on an outpatient basis.

Kevin Bursley, also a Pitt

 

3

counselor, said he relies on cogni-
tive therapy when treating a
patient. Cognitive therapy looks to
understand why people have the
negative thinking patterns they do
and then tries to change those pat-
terns.

"But it's more than just the
power of positive thinking,"
Bursley said.

Cox added that cognitive ther-
apy works best in addressing spe-
ciﬁc problems.

Crary said that a treatment
combining medication and thera-
py often worles best.

"It‘s a process of ﬁnding the
right therapist and not giving up
until you do. It also helps to be
open to different fonns of treat-
ment," Crary said.

If counselors carmot treat a
person at Pitt’s counseling center,
they will often refer the student to
another organization, such as the
Western Psychiatric Institute.

Crary said the job of the coun-
selors is to use the knowledge they
have gained from their education
and experience to best treat their
patients and to lead their patients
back to a full, active life.

"Many times, people who
come to us have lost interest in
life," said Crary. "It is our goal to
make them interested in life again.
Depression is a serious illness. Ifit
goes untreated, people will suffer
greatly from this."

GERMAN

Massey’s accomplishment.

Adolf Grunbaum, chairman of Pitt's
Center for Philosophy of Science said,
"Jerry Massey's imaginative and innovative
leadership as director of the center is already
legendary."

As a program director, Massey hosted a
number of Gennan scholars attending Pitt's
Center for Phﬂosophy of Science. Also, he
directed a number of conferences, meetings
and workshops that took place in conjunc-
tion with other academic institutions in
Germany. .

Massey was a key player in the forrna—
tion of the Pittsburgh—Konstanz Colloquium
in the Philosophy of Science —— a set of con-
ferences alternating every other year
between Pittsburgh and Germany. Along
with a special book series for reference to
archival holdings in scientiﬁc philosophy, he
also contributed to a special student
exchange program.

Still, Massey credits his recognition by
Germany to the academic center where he
works.

"I view the decoration primarily as an
award to the Center for Philosophy of
Science, and only derivatively as an award
for me personally," said Massey. "Our cen-
ter has done much for philosophy and histo-
ry of science in Germany, and the Germans
have in tum done much for us.”

President Herzog individually selected
Massey. To be considered for the award,
candidates were required to have received
recommendations from Germany's
Department of State and to participate in a
series of interviews.

The award was presented to Massey
two weeks ago in New York City at the
German Consulate. A small following ﬁem
Pitt attended the ceremony in support of
Massey.

Massey is an alumnus of the University
of Notre Dame, where he graduated magna
cum laude in 1956. He served forthree years
as an artillery officer in the United States
Marine Corps and eventually went on to
eamhisPl1D.in1964underProfessorCarl
G. Hernpel at Princeton University.

Build a new stadium,
but make it cheaper

Pittsburgh needs a new football stadium, and every-
body who pays for it should be able to go see a game.

Three Rivers is wholly inadequate for modern-day
football, because it just can’t make money on its audience.
They can’t raise theprices for the basic seating any more
than the already outrageous rates they charge. The only
way to increase revenues is with luxury boxes. These are

the only seats that wealthy, snobbish individuals and big— '

timecorporations arewillingtobuy.Thoseseatsbringina
lot of money, and without them, the Steelers just aren’t the
great source of revenue for the city ﬂiat they could be.

Luxury boxes just can’t be added to Three Rivers.
Because it is a multipurpose (read: obsolete) stadium, it is
used year-round by football and baseball, as well as by any
other major events that need a big venue, like a U2 concert.
Putting all those events on hold for several months during
renovations just isn’t an option.

The Steelers really need a new stadium, and the resi-
dents of Allegheny and a few surrounding counties should
be willing to pay for it. The proposed sever1—year, 0.5-per-
centincreaseinsalestaxtoﬁnanceﬂiestadiurnaverages
only about $40 per person per year. T'hat’s not a lot of
money for something that could bring new life back into
the city: Young residents may choose to stay in this other-
wise-deadbartown because there’s actually somewhere to
go on Sunday. New investors may decide to invest in this
city afteravisit thatthey wouldn’t have made butto see the
Steelers from a luxury box.

But there’s a very important compromise that ﬂie
Steelers should make in exchange for the big-money—gen-
erating luxury boxes: The price on regular seats should
come down.

It’s a shame that the average family of four can’t alford
to go to a football game for their hometown team. It
shouldn’t cost $200 for mom, dad and two kids to go to a
game and eat nachos.

Iftheaverage person is goingtopay $40ayearin
taxes to build this new stadium, then the average person
should be able to go to the events. The cost of basic seats
should come down, almost as much as should the cost of
refreshments. ’

The Steelers shouldn’t have any problem with this
compromise, either, since ﬂiey can always make up the dif-
ference by charging the suits in the new luxury boxes.‘

When someone asked about
this spending at last
Wednesday’s SGB meeting,
DalMolin requested to speak to
the student privately, after the
meeting.

Not publicly addressing the
issue, is he? Well, I guess the
kid’s squeaky clean.

This (fornication) misappli-
cation of the student-activities
fund prompted the whole alloca-
tions committee to resign after
issuing a letter that states its
members could no longer toler-
ate “the gross misuse of and
manipulation” of funds by mem-
bers of student government.

Ten people, representing the
student body, quit their jobs over
SGB spending. What does this
say? Read between the lines.
Our fine specimens of student
leaders are having a hell of a
good time with the student-
activities fund. It’s a classic case
of young politicians at their
ﬁnest.

Some SGB supporters can
be heard outside the student
union echoing cries of “The
school paper is, like, totally out
to get, like, SGB. It’s so messed

up.” Others find this whole
affair to be devastating. Kids
have even talked to their parents
about it. Whoa.

In actuality, what’s upsetting
is that students aren’t up in arms
about the spending. The majori-
ty of students here could care
less, but the ones who do care
must be appeased. Consider a
hypothetical political situation:
A student group is outraged over

this potential
misuse, and it
boasts of its

resentment over
these actions and
over its own lack
of funding. All
of this group’s
financial alloca-
tions — whether
questionable or

unquestionable
— are now
granted. The

SGB will help
grease the palm
to shut the mouth. Is this dirty
politics or an honest attainment
of needed funds?

People look the other way as
long as they get theirs. It’s soci-
etal conditioning, human nature
and politics all in one. So,
what’s the surprise? The “screw
them all” disposition?

Historically, Pitt’s student
government boards have always
held that attitude. In 1993, SGB
President Jacob Brody took his
board members on a $9,000
weekend retreat to Nemacolin
Woodlands — more proof that
student government is a great
way to have a hell of a good
time with a lot of money. No
actions were taken to prevent a

further mismanagement of
funds, and so 1997 brings anoth-
er set of accusations. In ‘93, it
was suggested that as long as
then—President Brody was not
addressed by masses of students,
he’d be able to dodge the issue,
and that’s what is happening
here. Why let this happen again
in another four years?

Here in Pittsburgh, it was
suggested that a civilian review
board be
formed to
monitor police
behavior. Why
not create a
student review
board for
SGB’s behav-
ior?

L e t ’ s
end the apathy.
Let’s take
away the pos-
sibility of rnis-
using student
funds by those
who can’t handle the responsi-
bility. The federal government
has three branches who act as
checks and balances to avoid
such mismanagement, and they
barely succeed.

How easy it must be to be
corrupt with just one governing
body. If the SGB is working for
the interests of the students, stu-
dents should oblige and work for
the best possible SGB, because
this one isn’t it.

So, where’s the sit-in?

Mike Ivan d0esn’t worry that
Pitt’s student body is less active
than Berkeley’s in 1968; he does

worry, though, that it’s less’

active than Berkeley's in 1948.

POINT/COUNTERPOINT

Cloning is wrong and the

U.S. should rule against it

Carrie

Hager

The cloning of humans is

‘ unethical and should be banned

now before it is too late.

Cloning has been a matter of
much debate since March when
the first successful cloning of a
mammal took place. Scottish sci-
entist Keith Campbell successful-
ly cloned a sheep named Dolly
from a 6-year-old ewe.

Dolly was the most complex
organism ever to be cloned.
Perhaps Campbell’s goal was to
simply to make more sheep, which
seems harmless enough. Perhaps
he didn’t see, further in the future,
rooms full of human clones, living
their lives as spare parts. Maybe
he just wanted an easier way to
produce milk. But the problem is,
now that Campbell has cloned the
sheep, it is only a matter of time
before someone can successfully
clone the shepherd.

Cloning raises many serious
ethical questions. Even President
Clinton, the liberal that he is, gave
an advisory panel 90 days to
decide if the cloning of humans is
to be regulated or banned in the
United States. It is currently legal,
but regulated, in many European
nations. I hope it will be banned
in the United States.
Unfortunately, even if it is banned
in the United States, what will be
allowed to go on in the rest of the
world is hard to imagine.

For those of you who have
watched too many science-fiction
movies, if humans were cloned,
they wouldn’t just march out of a
machine full-grown. They would
start from a single cell, just like
Dolly did. By definition, cloning
is manipulating a cell from an ani-
mal so that it grows into an exact
duplicate of that animal. A human
clone would have all the same
physical traits as the adult it was
cloned from, but would have dif-
ferent thoughts. and a different
personality.

Since the process for cloning
all mammals is basically the
same, now that one mammal has
been cloned, scientists have the
technology to clone any mammal.
It has been estimated that it will
take scientists from one to 10
years before they can successfully
clone humans, which really scares
me.

Many in favor of cloning say
that it would give infertile couples
a way to have a child of their own,
which sounds wonderful. But you
can’t have the good without the
bad, and in the case of human
cloning, the had far outweighs the
good.

For instance, if someone were
wealthy enough, he could have a
few clones made of himself in
case he ever needed a spare part
someday. Humans could be mass
produced, their only purpose to
provide hearts, livers or whatever
is needed at the time. That’s a

Marc Nuzzo

Send in the clones. That’s what I
say.

As the minutes tick away toward
my deadline for this article (also known
as the time after which a big, sweaty
guy called an “editor” begins hurling
objects at me, making my article even
more difﬁcult to write), I am a sudden
believer in the beneﬁts of cloning.

IfI had a clone, I suppose I could at
least put him in the line of ﬁre while I
pitter away at my keyboard. Better yet,
I could have another to do all my work
for me.

would be playing around with
human lives, many of which
would be lost.

Actually, cloning would elimi-
nate the need for normal human
relationships. Everything could be
done in the lab — and people are
already complaining about declin-
ing family values. With human
cloning, the term “family” would
have a whole new meaning.

With cloning, the worst is yet
to come. People need to stand up
and say that they won’t stand for
this unethical treatment of human
life before it is too late. No one
has the right to play God.

Carrie Hager is a young conserv-
ative who will never be cloned if
she has anything to say about it.

scientists wondering

what drove Campbell to work in an iso-
lated lab with the intent of performing
“reproductive experiments” on a sheep
named “Dolly.”

This sort of experimentation has
reportedly been going on for years in
sections of the Blue Ridge and Ozark
Mountains. If you ask me, Campbell
just got lucky... (Sort of gives new
meaning to the word “ewe,” huh?)

But having extra “you’s” in reserve
would make life a lot less stressful.

You, for example, could make
‘yourself’ clean up that ﬁmky furry lit-
tle ball of slime that all but stops water
from draining from your bathtub. For
that matter, you could kick “yourself”
-— heck, beat “yourself” with a lead

. pipe — whenever you feel stupid with-

out getting hurt.
You could force “yourself” to do

I've said it once and I'll say it
again and again: Clones rule

homework at gunpoint while you watch
“M.A.S.H.” reruns all night long and
still be able to honestly tell your profes-
sor that “you” did your homework.

Heck, “Is you talking to me?”
would even be proper grammar.

You could also run into a police sta-
tion ﬂailing your bloody arms while
screaming “I just killed myself!” and,
because suicide isn’t illegal, no one
could do anything about it.

Not only is your clone a “get out of
jail free” card, but also a very elfective
teaching tool — especially when it
comes to learning lessons like why not
to lick a frozen ﬂag pole, why you
shouldn’t watch TV while working with
a circular saw and why it’s not smart to
clean a loaded gun.

Locking one of your clones in a
small dark box, feeding him twice daily
and changing the litter pan might sound
cruel, but it would really work to your
beneﬁt. Under oath, any person could
honestly answer “No” when asked the
questions “Did you ever inhale?”, “Did
you kill Nicole or Ronald?” and “Do
you secretly enjoy the Kingston Trio?”

Our judicial process would also
beneﬁt ﬁom clones. Not only would it
begin to move faster than the process of
evolution, but we could also save a
small-Middle-Eastem-country’s nation-
al debt’s worth of money on lawyers,
too. For example:

Judge: How do you plead to the
charge of parking in a handicapped
area?

Defendant: Guilty, your honor, and
I demand the death penalty for myself.

Judge: Sounds a little harsh, but
OK

Defendant: Thank you, your
honor. I think I’ve learned a big lesson
from all of this. Bye.

Advertisers may have to rework
their adds, though, because they may
not be as effective as they now are.

For example, a conversation
between a person and his clone staring
at the the Nike slogan “Just Do It”
might sound a little like this:

Clone: “Just do it? Who should just
do it?”

Person: “You.”

Clone: “‘You’ who?”

Person: “No, thank you. I’m not
thirsty and I hate chocolate milk.”

Still, cloning is a concept that’s
long overdue. In the future, I think our
children would have a lot to say “thank
you-and-you-and-you” for.

Marc Nuzzo is having a severe identity
crisis right now.

 

Buccaneers,
Buccos, and
other ramblings

Random ramblings:

- People who are overexcited
about Pitt’s 21-17 Homecoming win
versus Miami and their top-30 rank-
ing are justified. Pitt beat a major
bowl team in the Hurricanes last
Thursday and now needs only three
more wins for a potential bowl berth.
In only its fourth game, Pitt now has
almost as many wins as it did all of
last year (four), and the leaves
haven’t even changed colors yet.
What once looked like a tough sched-
ule now looks tame when you con-
sider that Notre Dame may be 1-3 if
it loses to Michigan.

- How bad is the Big East this
year? Only Virginia Tech looks like a
legitimate New Year’s Day bowl can-
didate. The other teams look as bad
as South Oakland after a Saturday
night. In the last two weeks, Temple
beat Boston College, and then BC
beat up on West Virginia. Does this
mean there is parity in the Big East?

No, it means the teams stink.

- One of the announcers in the
Penn State-Louisville debacle sug-
gested that the Big East should add
another team from Florida, specifi-
cally Central Florida. That’s about
the best idea since the Rolling Stones
decided to tour into their 603. Call
me crazy, but that’s not exactly the
solution to the Big East’s problems.

0 The Steelers are really feeling
the effects of the rest of the NFL
picking apart their defense this off-
season. The Steelers‘ defense looked
awful in their opening-game blowout
at the hands of the Cowboys, and just
as awful in the first half versus the
Jaguars before they righted them-
selves in the second half.

Greg Lloyd has lost a step after
knee surgery, and the Black and Gold
desperately miss Chad Brown’s pass
rush. And anyone who thought Rod
Woodson wouldn’t be missed obvi-
ously didn’t see Randy Fuller’s futile
attempts on Monday night. Does any-
one remember Delton Hall?

° Pewter Power has hit the NFL.
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have
looked more like Green Bay than
Tampa Bay this season. Once the
laughing-stock of the NFL, the Bucs
now have the league’s best record at
4-0.

“A valuable experi-

This is how Pitt
Women’s Tennis Coach
George Dieffenbach

assessed his team’s recent
participation in the
Eastern Collegiate
Regionals Tournament
held this past weekend in
Princeton, N.J.

The Lady Panthers,
however, failed to experi-
ence the value of winning,
as the four singles players
and the two doubles teams
fell on hard times. They
were unable to escape
past the second round in
all but one of the tourna-
ment draws.

In the A-ﬂight singles,
vaunted freshman Lindsay
Carlson fell to Anna
Monhartova from St.

according to Dieffenbach,
turned out to be a valu-
able experience for
Carlson.

“Lindsay definitely

level and where exactly

of her progress,” said
Dieffenbach.

In the B—ﬂight singles,
Dana Jafarian earned a

bye into the second round,
where she subsequently
fell to Marryliz
Fitzpatrick of Fairfield
University, 6-1, 6-1.

In assessing Jafarian’s
performance, Dieffenbach
said, “Fitzpatrick was
steady, smart and consis-
tent. Dana battled and
forced many long points.
She, too, sees that she
needs to work hard to play
these top-notch players.”

The C-flight singles
draw saw some solid play
out of senior Fran Davis
— Pitt’s former No. 1
seed, who lost her ranking
to Carlson before the sea-
son started. She was
defeated 6-3, 6-3 in a
“long and difficult match”
that could have gone
“either way,” according to
Dieffenbach.

Dieffenbach also
commented that “this
match was really good for
Fran. She got to see and
hit a lot of balls, some-
thing her and everyone
else needs.”

In the last of the sin-
gles ﬂights, Amanda
Hoffman suffered through
shin splints to earn a 6-2,
6-3 defeat in the first
round. With four tough

Ultimate Force IX lincls unity
amidst breaking and screaming

Brett Simon
For The Pltt News

Curtis Smith, a well-known self-
defense teacher at Pitt and a
Pittsburgh Police officer, held his
ninth-annual Ultimate Force event
this past Sunday in conjunction with
Pitt’s East-West Martial Arts Club.

The exercise extravaganza show-
cased different forms of karate,
board-breaking, weaponry, fighting,
self—defense, weightlifting and pow-
erlifting.

There were a few big names on-
hand at the weightlifting competi-
tion. Smith recruited Bob Thomas,
the strongest cop in the world, as one
of the judges for the bench-press
competition. Thomas is also an offi-
cer on the Pittsburgh Police squad.

Thomas holds the world record
for the World Police and Fire Games
with a press of 600 pounds. In addi-
tion to the record, he owns four
national titles and is undefeated in
policeman/firefighter competitions.

“I’d like to stress that my titles
are all drug-free titles. It really sets a
good example for the kids,” Thomas
said.

Thomas also emphasized the
community aspect of the event. “It
gives the kids a chance to get
involved in something,” the police
officer said.

Also on-hand as a judge was
George Panzak, the Goodwill Games
coach for the United States. Panzak

is also a U.S. Weightlifting
Federation coach and has ambitious
plans for the future of weightlifting
competitions in this area.

“I’d like to bring nationals and
the world championships here to
Pittsburgh,” Panzak said.

Panzak also stressed the need for
a weightlifting club here at Pitt —-— a
group that he has been attempting to
start since before the school year
began.

“We have the kids and the talent,
but the students need to form a club.
I’d be very happy to help out,” he
said.

Panzak also teaches a weightlift-
ing and powerlifting class at Pitt.

Damon Jones, a Pitt graduate and
football player, was also a weightlift-
ing judge for the competition. Jones,
like Thomas, competes in the World
Police and Fire Games. Jones placed
fifth in this year’s competition.

Along with his lifting, Jones
plays on the police hockey team for
charity as well.

“I do this because it’s my way to
give back to the community, not only
protect it,” Jones said.

Both Thomas and Jones have
competed in past Ultimate Force
events.

This event’s various forms of
competition pitted all ages and ranks
against each other.

The karate portion of the pro-
gram was circus-like, which added to
the excitement of the event. Each

tournament was held in four separate
“rings,” with seated judges for each
ring. Ages and belts were divided
into groups of like ability and direct-
ed into their circular arenas by event
officials.

While the karate (and the organi-
zation of the karate segment) caught
the eyes of most in attendance, the
board-breaking competition provided
quite a spectacle in terms of both
sound and sight. Shouts from each
competitor in each ring echoed
throughout the room as the judges
watched attentively.

More than one fan expressed
amazement at how easily these ath-
letes could split thick wooden

boards.

The self—defense display was a
nice change of pace after the board-
breaking event. Each competitor

stepped into a ring and demonstrated
different techniques for fending-off
attackers. After a few waves of
attackers and loud screaming, each
bowed before the judges and was
applauded by the crowd.

The self—defense event and the
applause that it evoked seemed to
capture the three themes of the after-
noon: fun, competition, and, of
course, screaming. After just about
every move in the karate events, a
loud cry could be heard testifying to
the effort each person had committed
to his craft.

Even the weightlifters could be
heard grunting and moaning, strug-
gling for every last ounce of strength
they could muster. Weightlifters who
were waiting their turn were even
cheering on their opponents in the
spirit of competition.

entire college career, and this has
had a notable impact on her achieve-
ments.

“All of my different coaches
have been my biggest inﬂuences,”
said Haefner. “Cindy Alvear has
definitely been the best one.”

These inﬂuences have led
Haefner to many accomplishments.
At Rush Henrietta in Rochester,
Haefner was twice an all-state selec-
tion, and she was named to the all-
county first team four straight years.
During Haefner’s four years of high
school, her volleyball team was
undefeated. After these achieve-
ments, Haefner received a volleyball
scholarship to attend the University
of Pittsburgh.

In her first start as a college
player in her freshman season,
Haefner completed 26 assists, seven
digs, two kills and two aces. As a
freshman, Haefner played a total of
32 matches. In that time she totaled
257 assists as the team’s second set-
ter. In two separate matches, she tal-
lied 38 assists, a career high.

During last week’s Tennessee
Tournament, Haefner was named the
tournament’s most valuable player
and the Big East player of the week.

In addition to her accomplish-
ments, Tara Haefner has provided
leadership to her team. Her team-
mate, junior Jessica Van Der Mallie,
said, “Tara is a really emotional
leader. She knows exactly what to
do for each player to help her play
her best. Her attitude helps our
game.”

Haefner doesn’t hesitate to
return her teammates’ praise.

“At this point I am very proud of
my teammates,” she declared. “This
is by far the closest team that we
have ever had. We have so much
potential, and our confidence is
strong.”

Sports-talk comes to college radio: the WPTS Sports Journal

Matt Mento

For The Pitt News

Look out, Stan and Guy. Bruce
Keidan, watch your back. Thor Tolo, be
careful.

Local sports radio has a new source
of competition.

WPTS radio, 92.1 FM, has a
sports—talk radio show that gives col-
lege students an alternative to the city’s

‘ other sports shows. WPTS is broadcast

straight out of the fourth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union and is run by Pitt
students. The “Sports Journal” is
broadcast daily, Monday through
Friday, from 4:30 to 5:00 pm.

This sports—talk show is more than
your typical Pittsburgh city sports
show in that it has more than the usual
Penguin, Steeler and Pirate reports.
According to second—year sports broad-
caster Dan Allinson, the show covers

all sports and all teams, both profes-
sional and college — a plus for college
students who may be far from their
local favorites.

“We’ve basically aligned the pro-
gram towards all sports, especially
Pennsylvania’s sports teams from
Pittsburgh, as well as Philadelphia,”
said Allinson. He also mentioned that
the show’s format is similar to that of
610 WIP, an all-sports-radio network
broadcast from Philadelphia.

The show has a very relaxed
atmosphere, where the broadcasters
voice their opinions and throw in a few
jokes here and there. But, they also get
as much information out to the listeners
as possible.

“We are trying to direct the pro-
gram to what the students would care
about,” said Allinson.

In addition to their daily duties,

cast all Pitt home football and basket-
ball games, and get to travel to a few
away ones.

“It’s exciting to do the away games
because we get to see other campuses
and compare them to our own,” said
sports director Steve Friedell.

Last year, the radio crew traveled
to Notre Dame" to broadcast Pitt foot-
ball and aired live coverage of the Pitt-
WVU Backyard Basketball Brawl in
Morgantown.

On occasion, the weekly show will
feature a Pitt athlete as a guest. Last
year it featured Mark Blount during
basketball season and Jason Chavis
during the football season.

“This year, we’re trying to feature
more Pitt athletes,” said Allinson.

The show covers all that happened
in sports from the night before, putting
as many scores as possible into the
half-hour format. Sportscasters also do
previews of the games to be played that
night.

Right now, according to Friedell,
the show will focus primarily on base-
ball and football action during the

week and weekend, previewing the
important contests, and giving all the
‘scores from earlier games, complete
with analysis.

“Previews of the upcoming games
are my favorite, especially on Mondays
with ‘Monday Night Football,”’ said
Friedell.

Despite his personal preference,
Friedell says the show has been placing
a heavier emphasis on pro baseball
lately with the playoffs approaching
and the Pirates still in contention.
There is also more of a concentration
on college and pro football thanks to
the goal-post—destruction—inspiring
successes of the Pitt football squad and
the Pittsburgh Steelers’ playoff poten-
tial.

The show plans on beginning cov-
erage of the NHL in a few weeks and
will focus on the Penguins when the
regular season starts.

“It’s good experience for the
future, especially for future radio jobs
in the real world,” said Friedell. “The
show also gives the students someone
they can relate to on the air.”
