Kairys Opens Yearbook

1939 Owl Sales
To Feature ‘Name
On Cover’ Policy

Al Kairys, BA39, Owl business
manager, will open the 1939 year-
book undergraduate subscription
campaign today. Each student
who buys an Owl this week may
have his name printed in gold on
the cover, Kairys announces.

The 1939 Owl, according to Kairys,
is now on sale to all undergraduate
students at three dollars and ﬁfty
cents. A down payment of one dol-
lar and ﬁfty cents will secure the
book until publication in May, when
the remainder will be paid.

According to Harold Viehman, C39,
editor, the 1939 Owl featuring the
University’s famous nationality rooms,
six: pages, devoted to intra—mural
sports, and more campus life in pic-
tures than before, will surpass all
previous yearbooks.

“Individuals and campus organiza-
tions ordering their Owl on Wednes-
day, and Friday of this week will
have their names printed free on the
cover. This offer will not be extend-
ed,” states Kairys, who also promised
a large and new contest involving the

-entire student body of the undergrad-

uate classes, to be announced Mon-
day.

According to Sam Whiteman, BA40,
circulation manager of the Owl, there
will be a display and sales office on
the ground floor of the Cathedral be-
ginning today.

'My Man Godirey'
Billed For Free

Showing Tomorrow

A two-months series of free
movies on campus will begin to-
morrow when “My Man Godfrey”
is shown from 11:30 to 5 o’clock
in 324 Cathedral.

Sponsored by SFA, through its
theater committee, the sound mov-
ies will be shown every Thursday
during February and March. The
showing of complete features is an
outgrowth of the SFA plans for.a
newsreel theater.

In order that as many students
as possible may see the pictures,
the showings will be continuous
from 11:30 o’clock,_ according to
Cyrill‘ ~A. ~—~Bie1ek,~ ~B’A39,~i chairman
of the theater committee. Seating
capacity of the student theater will
be 210. _

Films already secured for future
showings in the third ﬂoor cin-
ema include “Farewell to Arms,”
“Magniﬁcent Obsession,” “The
Plainsman,” “The Good Fairy,”
“Showboat,” and “The General
Died at Dawn.”

The ﬁrst movie to be shown,
“My Man Godfrey,” with Carole
Lombard and William Powell, was
one of the successes of 1937. First
of the “screwball” variety, its new
type of humor was a hit and it
was first run. for several weeks in
Pittsburgh‘. I ~ ' 7 ‘ ‘ 

According to Bielek, success and
continuance of the project depends
“upon support and cooperation of
the student body.” Success of the
project will depend upon the size
of the turnout.

Little Cuts in Ciass Cards Slash

Overtime in Registrai"s Office

By Jack Brady

Those little cuts in the class cards
which had everyone wondering dur-
ing registration perform a job that
considerably lightens the work of
the registrar’s staff.

Previous to registration approxi-
mately 40,000 cards are punched with
an automatic puncher. A duplicate
amount is punched to be used in case
of mistakes and changes.

When the cards are returned to the
registrar’s office, a master card is
made for each student on an auto-
matic puncher. The master card,
with the class cards, is then placed in
a “reproducing gang puncher.” In
this, it automatically reproduces the
punches that were inserted on the
master card.

The cards are then placed in a sort-
ing and counting machine. They are
divided automatically by the ma-
chine and arranged alphabetically.
New students also made out index
and census cards. The class cards

6*

are again put into the machine and
divided according to group, class and
section.

There are separate columns on this
machine for all undergraduate groups.
The number of students in each class
automatically registers in the speciﬁc
columns provided for that class. E.
A. Batchelder, assistant registrar, and
his assistants have established a rec-
ord, in that they were able to com-
pletely sort 10,000 cards in two and
a half hours, and have them ready
for distribution to the various schools.

Mistakes or changes from groups
or schedules are rectified by covering

one punch with a sticker and re-’

punching a new hole.

This “efﬁciency-plus” system is ex-
actly the same as the one used by the
Department of Federal Investigation
in Washington. By means of coded
numbers, ﬁngerprint cards are broken
down into small groups. The groups
are then inspected by hand.

campuses.

In most instances college admin-
istrations have waived tuition fees
while student—facu1ty committees
have raised funds for room and
board and living expenses.

The committee seeks to bring to

ability whose achievements and
personality put them on a level
with Rhodes scholars. Selections
are therefore based on exceptional
academic records, well rounded in-
terest in non-academic subjects, to-
gether with testimonials of excel-
lent character.

cars will operate as express cars; the
other two will operate as locals, aug-
mented by the two manual cars.

Complete service from the ground

or two just told us, rather vaguely, that they just weren’t
in sympathy with the plan, and let it go at that. But
others gave reasons.

From one prominent man-about-campus, whose ob-
jections, incidentally, were not strong enough to keep
him from serving on the committee, we obtained a per-
tinent criticism. The gentleman in question expressed
fears that our plan might be dangerous in that it would
tend to stimulate a spirit of jingoism, might stir un-
necessarily the feelings of hate and consequent war-
fever among students. As an example of the growing
trend in this direction, he pointed to the current cycle

of sickening ﬂag—waving on our legitimate stage and in -

the ﬁlm industry.

Now, if we are interpreting the epithet “jingo”
rightly, it refers to someone who deliberately and boast-
fully goes out of his way to stir up international ani-
mosity, and who avoids concrete issues by appealing to
vague emotions and abstract principles of super-nation-
alism. So we can’t therefore, see just why a plan to
aid refugee students should stir up . . .

Jingoism and W'ar-Fever . . .

because, in the first place, we’re not going out of our
way at all to stir up things. In fact, we’re not stirring
up things. It is other intolerant individuals and groups
who have done the stirring up, who have dumped un-
regimentable intellectual wares on the world market.
And we are trying, by obviously concrete means, to do
the decent and humanitarian thing by trying to ﬁnd a
place in more enlightened surroundings for these edu-
cational outcasts.

Another student we talked to said, “ by not take
care of our own students ﬁrst? There are many stu-
dents here in the United States who need assistance in
order to get an education.”

We agree that there are many American youth who
have been denied a college education through lack of
opportunity. But it is true that provisions, however in-
adequate, have been made to provide scholarships and
assistance for needy students by universities, private
organizations, and government alike. The local prob-
lem is, moreover, deﬁnitely a long-range, continuous
process. The refugee problem, on the other hand is . . .

An Immediate Problem . . .

arising suddenly, and calling for as immediate a solution
as possible. Some immediate action must be taken as
the opportunity ﬁnally arises to display a little of that
“world fellowship” and international good will mission-
aries and statesmen and educators have so long been
talking about.

Cited also by several students were the difficulties
to be encountered in selecting refugee students and
bringing them to the local campus. Quite obviously,
quota restrictions, emigration difliculties, transportation
troubles, etc., will be encountered. Care must be taken
so that students selected will be able to meet entrance
requirements, may be properly oriented, and not left
stranded through lack of funds.

In view of these conditions, it is fortunate that a
committee, the “Refugee Student Coordinating Commit-
tee,” has been formed under the guidance of the Insti-

tute of International Education and the International

Student Service. Among its purposes are the dissemina-
tion of information and advice to various college groups
raising funds for refugee students as well as selecting,
upon. request, students for whom resources are made
available in various institutions.

We are not at all backward in admitting that ours is
deﬁnitely . . .

Not A New Ieda . . .

for, as a story on today’s front page states, only about
47 other colleges and universities are trying the same
thing. But we tliink it a project worthy of support by
students, faculty, and administration at the University.

And we appreciate the cooperative and wholesome
reaction already shown on campus. It’s not an easy
project. But it offers an opportunity to do something
co,nstructive and concrete about a situation which has
few constructive or concrete aspects.

l{.et9s Root;
At The Record . .. .
‘ -  by John Burnham

Recently much discussion has taken place as to the
advisability of maintaining compulsory class attendance
Considering class attendance as the stu-
dent’s own concern, a few colleges have abandoned
compulsory measures, thus placing it upon a purely
voluntary basis. ‘ I

According to the seventh report of the Student Opin-
ion Surveys, 63.5 pcr cent of the students interviewed
oppose compulsory attendance. Opposition to compul-
sory attendance is strongest in the East.

The best known example of an experiment in volun-
tary attendance is that incorporated in the “New Plan”
of the University of Chicago. Pioneered by such educa-
tors as Robert M. Hutchins, the “New Plan” has aban-
doned the credit system and instead awards college cer-
tiﬁcates for the successful passing of seven comprehen-
sive examinations covering diiferent ﬁelds of knowledge.

The student can study as hard and as long as he
wishes before attempting to pass the examinations.
Classes are held for those who wish instruction, but at-
tendance is in no way compulsory. Needless to say,
examinations cannot be passed without intensive study,
and classroom attendance provides an excellent way of
clarifying and supplementing one’s studies.

Results of this plan, which has been in operation since
1931, show that student progress is slower at first than
under the credit system. But when the student be-
comes accustomed to studying a ﬁeld of knowledge
rather than several subjects, his rapid progress is ac-
companied by real mastery of that ﬁeld.

Iowa State Teachers’ college also served as a testing
ground for volunta:y attendance. Observers could de-
tect no appreciable diﬁference in scholastic achievement
between classes run on the compulsory and those on the
voluntary basis.

1.

Superior students did better work under the voluntary
plan than when compelled to attend classes; their
absences were no more numerous than the average of
the class. Poor students attended more classes and
did better work when compelled ‘to attend classes.

While rare in colleges, Sw:-irthmore college’s attend-
ance plan is common among graduate schools. It grants
juniors and seniors of high scholastic standing the privi-
lege of attending classes voluntarily. Its acknowledged
success supplements other evidence that good students
make effective use of voluntary attendance.

Beautiful “Volume-mm?
No Such Thing,-«Scltocn

By Bill Colker

“There is no such thing as a beautiful woman.” ,

So spoke Dr. Max Schoen, psychology head of the
Carnegie Institute of Technology, at Monday’s meeting
of the Psychology Forum, discussing “The Psychology
of Aesthetic Experience.”

In explaining, Dr. Schoen stated, “When you say a
woman is beautiful, she is no longer a woman. She
ceases to belong to any class of objects, but is made up
of various components. All you have is form.”

“A painter doesn’t paint a table. He paints a form.
Beauty doesn’t reside in merely being a certain object.”

Discussing beauty further, Dr. Schoen said, “The term
‘beautiful’ is frequently used outside the realm of art
to indicate a unique value attached to commonplace
events. What is it that is beautiful in an idea, an act,
or a friendship? The idea is beautiful because it is
prized for what it is. It has intrinsic value, and as in-
trinsic it is a form. Similarly, a good act is good in
terms of some function it has performed, while the
beauty is in the act itself, and the act itself is a form.”

He continued, “If a painting is art, it is not such be-
cause it is a painting of a ﬁeld, or a tree, or a barn, or
a person. Nor is a drama or novel an art product just
because it deals with a particular human situation.
What is left. then, is form. If prose is judged to be
artistic, it is the style, the form of presentation, that
is artistic, not the subject matter of the prose.

“The ideas may be false, absurd, yet the writing can
be artistic. When something is artistically done, it is
not what is done that is artistics, but how it  done.
Thus, the aesthe ic. as experience, is pure experience.”

Dr. Schoen cited  example of “pure experience” by
relating how a youngster in his l_ome was one evening
at sunset standing in front of a window gazing intently
outdoors. ’.7.‘he child was insistent that the Dr. come
and look. There, holdin<= his attention, and cutting
through the trees like a spike of gold, was a beam of
sunlight.

“That was a pure experience,” exclaimed Dr. Schoen.

ing suspicion: we are convinced that
tne buttons have positively no con-
nection with the elevators.

In theory, pushing a button is sup-
posed to signal the elevator operator
to stop. We cannot be too emphatic
in stating that this is pure theory.

As far as We can see, the only
function that the push-buttons serve
is to relieve the wrath of those who
stand and wait. Jiggling the but-
tons, poking them with an umbrella,
holding them in with an elbow all
make elevator-waiting more beara-
ble. None of these activities will
cause the elevator to stop—not until
it chooses.

A notable instance of the utter
uselessness of the push—buttons is
illustrated by the political science
major who pushed “Down” and had
to wait so long that he decided to
write his congressman. It is rumor-
ed that he even received a reply
from Washington before an elevatorf
stopped for him. I

As the result of an earlier column,
the problem of those already packed
in an elevator, we have been ac-
cused of neglecting the sufferings of
those who wait. This charge is un-
true. To the “wait’n’ wait—ers” we’ll
give our utmost sympathy—but not

AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 8.-—-Abolition
of ‘compulsory class attendance in
colleges, a subject seldom mentioned
two decades ago, has become an is-
sue of the day. That development
seems largely a result of pioneering
by educators like Robert M. Hutch-
ins with his Chicago Plan, which
allows students to attend classes at
their own discretion.

Few schools, however, have fol—‘.
lowed the lead taken by the Univer- '
sity of Chicago. The majority of the
nation’s colleges still require com-
pulsory class attendance in varying‘
degrees.

Although educators discuss the
question among themselves, seldom
have they asked the opinions of the‘
students, who are most vitally in-
terested in the question. The Stu-
dent Opinion Surveys of America are
able to give voice for the first time
to the students’ views on the issue.

The nation’s college youth were
asked, “Should compulsory class at-
tendance in colleges be abolished?”

Yes, said . . . . .635 per cent
No, said . . . . ..36.5 per cent

 

Local opinion when polled for the
Student Opinion Surveys on the
question of compulsory class attend-
ance tended to follow the national
average by voting 34 to 25 for the
abolishment of attendance require-
wnents. Only one of the sixty stu-
dents questioned failed to express an
opinion on the question.

Even though the poll revealed a!
sizeable majority who favored abol-
ition of compulsory attendance, the
fact that more than a third opposed
the idea is signiﬁcant. It invalidates
the claim of many elders that prac-
tically all students, if given any say,
would want to do away with com-
pulsory presence in classes.

Breaking down the result section-
ally, sentiment favoring abolition is
strongest. in the East. The Middle At-
lantic states showed a majority of
68.7 per cent who answered “yes.”
In the West and Midwest, students
were more evenly divided on the is-
sue. In the West Central states,
which include the Chicago section, a
bare majority-53.8 per cent—were’
for abolition. ‘

From the

By Leonard Levison

Shoulder

Sports Editor

Since glamour happens to be one of those intangibles that evade
effective analvsis, we have veered away from any probings into the
“what-have-we-here” of Dr. H. Clifford Carlson’s current ﬂat—ﬂoor

combine.

The most positive thing that may be said about it was

the phrase that the good doctor reverted to when he returned from his

annual junket into the Big Ten outskirts.

“They are the glamour

boys,” he remarked with appropriate 1‘he’EOI‘iC.

At the time, he was referring to‘v‘

the varying playing state with which
they took to the ﬂoor on various eve-
nings. One time they were up, and
the next time they were down. And,
certainly their coach didn’t know
when they were going to be which.
Up And Down

Their coming out party in Evans-
ton with the Northwestern Wildcats
as the stag line was enough to sat-
isly Brenda Frazier. Then, they
went over to Peoria and proceeded.
to do thin,’-gs just the opposite way.
This was the manner in which they
started out and this has been the
inanner in which they have moved
along this season. There is no cer-
tainty as to how they will perform
on any given evening.

Second Straight

Saturday they were far above the
Carnegie clansmen, who are cur-
rently leading the Conference, but
who weren’t playing in exactly what
could be called_pa_ce—setting_ ball at
moment. Nevertheless, it was the
second consecutive _7Panthe1:;, triumph
and the secbnd conference win for
the Pitt sophomores and Scherer.

League Chance

This state of affairs seem to lead
up to the hunch that Frank Carver
has been passing. off all winter—that
Pitt will kiss the Conference boys
goodbye by attaching another en-
graving in the plaque. Of course,
the Conference is none too healthy
this season, and the accomplishment
would not measure up to the epitome
in basketball achievement. But, it’s
something to play for.

Just how likely this is to happen
will be given some bit of corrobora-
tion when the Panthers tangle with
“Gentleman John” Lawther’s Penn

State deliberators this evening. Penn
State, like Pitt, is the possessor of
one of the better informed basketball
mentors, but its basketball playing
this year has been in a similar state
of vacillation.

Bowling, Tahie

Tennis Carded

Seven contests are scheduled for
Independent and Engineering League
consumption today and tomorrow as
the fraters continue their domina-
tion of the intramural calendar.

Table tennis is the main item on
today’s menu with three matches
due on the Trees Gym tables. The
Electrical Engineers open the ﬁring
at 4 o’clock against the Industrial
Engineers with the Chemical Engi-
neers following up at 5 o’clock with
the YMCA ping-pongers.

The Metallurgists, touch football
kings of the Engineering loop, seek
for more honors at 6 o’clock as they
face the Meds in the ﬁnale of the
day’s table tennis competition.

Newman Club is heavily favored
to knock off the Ramblers in a 5
o’clock volleyball engagement and
continue their policy of making a
walk away of the Independent
League. The Newmans have been
easy victors in all of their previous
volleyball conquests.

The bowlers work out tomorrow
afternoon at 5 o’clock on the Strand
Alleys. The Electricals tackle the
Civil Engineers No. 1 while the Civ-
ils No. 2 try to bowl over the Inde-
pendents and the Chemical Seniors
engage the Independents.

Woodruff’s injury Adds Further
Doubt To indoor Track Status

Pitt’s crippled track team, recentlyO———

out of the running at the Millrose
meet in New York, may not partici-
pate in the Penn AC games in Phila-
delphia this Friday.

Johnny Woodruff is deﬁnitely out
of Fr.i_day’s meet due to a pulled
muscle in his leg. John’s loss not
only deprives Pitt of his individual
brilliance, but it removes the anchor
man from the mile relay team.

Chief contenders for Woodruff’s
place on the relay team are Larry
Tregonning, blonde ﬂyer from Altoo-
na, and Clyde Graf, another sopho-
more speedster who has been push-
ing the regulars for starting posi-
tions all season.

Ken Ryden, University record
holder in the high and low hurdles,
is also on the sick list. Ryden is
suffering from a throat infection
which apparently has hampered his
running.

Al Ferrarra, Allan McKee, and
Frank Ohl are prepared to carry the
gold and blue colors in the relay, but
without the long striding Woodruff
at the anchor spot, it is quite doubt-
ful that any substitute would make
the Olson quartet a winner.

jllanagers

Intramural team managers will
meet in Trees Gym with Director
James Potts this week according
to the following schedule:

Independent"s—VVed., Feb. 8, 4
o’clock.

Fraternities—Thurs., Feb. 9, 4
o’clock.

Mc$oriey Juggles ,
Line Combinations,
Moves Up Irv Ar-tz

With the Pittsburgh Hornets using
Duquesne Garden this evening, the
Mcsorley Menace, known more fa-
miliarly as the Pitt hockey team, gets
a full day to rest from last night’s
Tech game before going back to the
routine of practice sessions.

The Panthers can use rest, a lot of
it, for next Tuesday they begin the

"toughest stretch in of their 1938-39

schedule. In eight days, they face
off against Duquesne, John Carroll,
and Western Reserve, the clubs who,
with Pitt, are the class of the league.

Examinations left the Blue and
Gold puck pushers unscathed in the
matter of eligibility, but Coach Mc-
Sorley has made several changes in
the makeup of his lines and defense
combinations.

Tatey Brittain played center for
the ﬁrst time in the Case game and,
a natural “rover,” he clinched the
position on the line with Shiring and
Broido as wings. Irv Artz has been
shifted to play with Bob Schooley
and center Dick Friday, with Bobby

Lowe ﬁlling in on either trio when
necessary.

Bill Schildecker, sophomore wing,
has been turned in to a defense
man to team with Walt Lovett. Pat

lot of what it takes to make points,
but with the departure of high-scorer
Sol l\/Iiehoff, who received his gradu-
ation passport into the business world
last June, the Lions became meek in
the extreme, and the long-legged
Lawther is now employing an old-
fashioned bath towel to sob his
meager scores into. His Nittany gang
is sputtering just below the ﬁfty-
ﬁfty mark.

State’s lineup is unimposing, with 

veteran Charley Prosser being the
lone exception. This boy rates with
Penn State's best of all—time in whip-
ping the sphere through the cords.
Presser measures well over six feet
in height, as do most of the Nittany

be a valuable influence, but he has
run hot and cold with discouraging
consistency.

Dr. Carlson is dickering with a

Women to Debate at Swissvale,
Allderdice on Alliance Question

Women’s Debating Association be-9

gan its second semester's work with
debates yesterday and today.
Yesterday Leona Lieberman, C41,
and Hilda Landerman, C41, uphold
the proposition that the United
States should form an alliance with
Great Britain, against the negative
claims of Pearl Hilsenrath, C41, and

High school.

Today the same question is being
debated at Taylor Allderdice High
school. Esther Glick, C41, and Helen
Lubit, Ed40, are speaking for the
union, with Florine Robinson, C41,
and Harriet Wertkin, C41, arguing
against it.

During the recent vacation be-
tween semesters, two of the debating
association members traveled to Penn
State for a radio debate with repre-
sentatives from that college.

Goldie Katz, Ed39, and Elizabeth
Arowick, C41, debated at Jersey
Shore city high school to one of the
largest audiences faced by squad
members this year. The speeches
were broadcast over a radio network.

They upheld the afﬁrmative of the
question, “Resolved: That the United
States should follow a policy of iso-
lation toward all countries engaged
in international or civil conﬁict out-
side the western hemisphere.”

The team, accompanied by their
coach, Miss Charlotte Mclvlurray, left
Pittsburgh Thursday morning, Jan-
uary 26, and returned the following
evening.

A new program of meetings will
become effective this semester. Each
week there will »be a class in argu-

well as the regular conference meet-

ln Witt ‘Old Masters’ Exhibition

By John Brosky

A
7

Most of the paintings and draw-
ings exhibited by the ﬁne arts depart-
ment during the ﬁrst semester have
been the works of mediocre twenti-
eth century painters.

This week, however, the depart-
ment has an exhibition of some real
art work with an historical back-
ground, represented in pen and ink
drawings by masters of the 16th, 17th,
and 18th centuries.

Show Closes Saturday

The display, which will continue
here until February 11, includes 34
pen sketches from the famous collec-
tion of Sir Robert Witt of London.

As compared to contemporary
paintings which depict the man on
the street corner or the sweating mill
worker, the drawings present various
forms of draftsmanship and an over
abundance of imagination interwoven
with realistic qualities that touch our
sensitiveness.

In the drawing by Barlow, a Brit-
ish artist who lived from 1626 to 1702,
one can almost hear the guttural purr
of the mother cat as her kittens climb
on her back and rejoice over the
rooster’s head and dead rat she
brought home.

One -American Represented

The Witt Collection is dominated
by Italian and British art masters
who have stood the test of time.
There are also drawings by Flemish,
Dutch, French, and American artists.

Several sketches, centuries old, still
possess an exquisite quality of taste
and freshness. A drawing which will
last for many more centuries is the
“Boy With the Bowl” by Giovanni B.
Piazzetta, 1682-1754.

It is astonishing to note the ways
the effect is produced merely by pen

and ink or chalk and crayon. A
beautiful scene picture is given us by
Thomas Monro in his drawing of a
slumbering house in the woods with
a man and his dog trotting along ‘the
lake shore in the foreground.

Benjamin West is the only Ameri-
can having a drawing in the lot.
Other outstanding artists representec‘;
are Tintoretto, Carracci, Tiepolo,
Gainsborough, Constable, and Rom-
ney.

Discussing the art collection of
Sir Robert Witt, Dr. Walter R.
Hovey, professor of the department
of ﬁne arts, will deliver his ﬁrst
illustrated lecture of the new
semester in the ﬁne arts library at
8:30 o’clock this evening.

Dr. Hovey will discuss the crafts-
manship of the Witt Collection,

which is now on exhibition on the
seventh ﬂoor.

Bishop Will Speak
At Public Meeting

Bishop Alexander Mann, of the
Protestant Episcopal diocese of Pitts-
burgh, will speak on “Democracy
and Intellectual Freedom” at a pub-
lic meeting in Trinity Cathedral,
Sixth avenue near Smithﬁeld, at 8
o’clock Sunday evening.

The National Committee for Dem-
ocracy and Intellectual Freedom is
sponsoring the meeting which will
commemorate the 130th birthday cel-
ebration of Abraham Lincoln. Dr.
John G. Bowman, chancellor of the
University is one of the sponsors of
this group.

All members of the faculty and
student body are invited to attend.

‘Policy’ Questions
In 1000-Mile Tour

Concluding a series of intercollegi-
ate debates which covered three ques-
tions and took six members of the
Men’s Debating Association over 1000
miles through seven states, two men,
Bernard McKenna, C39, manager,
and Saul Dizenfeld, C39, arrived on
campus today.

After -discussing pump—priming, la-
bor incorporation, and an Anglo-
America.n alliance with two colleges
and three universities, McKenna and
Dizenfeld, together with Roy H.
Umble, director of Men’s Debating
Association, brought to an end the
forensic trip Monday, at Colgate.

On the same day another Univer-
sity team went on a barnstorming
tour with Western Reserve univer-
sity. Abe Wolovitz, C40, and Ed-
ward Springer, C39, upheld both the
afﬁrmative and negative of the Anglo-
American alliance before two high
schools in Youngstown and one high
school in Salem.

Debate Recorded

University of Pennsylvania in Phila-
delphia to argue the question of labor
union incorporation on January 31.
This debate was recorded with the
possibility that J. M. Nichols would
include it in his annual compilation,
“Intercollegiate Debates.”

In New Jersey they met Rutgers
university before the Jersey

ing. They went on to contest Boston
college on the same question; on the
road. home, the team stopped at Syra-
cuse, to debate Colgate university on
the pump-priming question over the
local radio network, last Monday.

Christie Walthour, C39, and Ernest
Larson, C40, argued the same ques-
tion before the McKeesport chapter
of the Knights of Columbus with St.
Vincent college of Latrobe, last
Thursday evening.

First Radio Debate

Monday’s barnstorming trip to Ohio
found Wolovitz and Springer sup-
porting the afﬁrmative of the Anglo-
American alliance question before
Rayen high school at Youngstown in
the morning. They maintained the
negative of the same question before
Niles high school at Youngstown in
the afternoon. Between these two
debates, the team motored to Salem
high school to meet Western Reserve
on the aﬂirmative. ' -

Before Springer and Wolovitz left
for Ohio, they met Marquette univer-
sity in the ﬁrst radio debate of the
year.

Representing the Milwaukee uni-
versity were law students, Howard
Raether and Ralph Houseman. This
encounter marked the third consecu-
tive year that this two-man team met
a University unit.

The afternoon’s discussion was
broadcast over radio station WWSW
from 5 o’clock till 5:45 o’clock.

Chemist Honored

Dr. Alexander Silverrnan, profes-

O’Connell Writes
For Merck Report

Of interest to medical and pharm-
acy students is an article written by
Dr. C. Leonard O’Connell, dean of
School of Pharmacy, which appears
in the current issue of The Merck
Rep01‘t_. monthly magazine of pharm-

gacy and medicine.

The article entitled, “The Pharm-

acist of Tomorrow,” discusses the
new four-year course in pharmacy.
Dr. O'Connell believes that this
course will be more advantageous to
students in that it will give them a
better general training in addition to
the technical knowledge necessary
for their profession.
“Most competent thinkers in mat-
ters of pharmaceutical education feel
that while the old system produced
able men and did a good job of what
it set out to do, it had some serious
clefects,” he comments.

“Chief among these was its over-
emphasis upon acquisition of knowl-
edge and its rather cursory treat-
ment of the problem of applying that
knowledge to novel situations.”
