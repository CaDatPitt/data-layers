Polish Room_Will
Hold Chopin MSS

First Room Plans Complete With
Arrival Of Ceiling Model

With the arrival of a plaster model
of the “crystal ceiling” of the Jagiel-
lonian library of the University of
Cracow from which the ceiling of the
Polish nationality room will be adapt-
ed and the professor’s chair of solid
oak and russet leather, plans for the
Polish nationality room are completed.
It is the first nationality room for
which all plans are completed.

Included in the arrangements are
original manuscripts of Chopin, Pa-
derewski, and of Sienkiewicz, author
of “Quo Vadis” and Rayment, author of
“Peasants,” both Nobel prize winners.

In Cracow, Henry Vvaldyn, an out-
standing bronzesmith, is making a re-
plica of the famous “Globus Jagiellon-
icus” used by Copernicus, which still
stands in the library in -Cracow, The
globe is the gift of the Polish National
Alliance.

The design of the room was con-
ceived by Professor Szyszko Bohusz,
who is using picturesque Polish adap-
tations of Gothic style as the basic
motif for the classroom. The ceiling
—-it will be the only one in America-
has diamond-shaped vaulting ﬁnished
with white plaster.

Athletes Score
High In Studies

Group Average Of Varsity Teams
Tops All-Fraternity Median

University athletes do as well in
their studies as they do on the foot-
ball ﬁeld, basketball ﬂoor, cinder track,
swimming pool or cross-country
courses, according to the scholastic
averages of the sports men, recently
compiled by the athletic department.

General averages for the
semester were higher than in previous
years and more athletes made the

honor list of those having at least a‘

 average.

The group average for all varsity
squads, including swimming, basket-
ball, riﬂe, boxing, cross-country, foot-
ball. track and wrestling, was 1.320.
This mark eclipsed the general fra-
ternity average of 1.268 and the gen-
eral average of the entire undergrad-
uate student body, which was approx-
imately 1.1.

Leading the list of mark-makers
were the swimmers with a group
average of 1.634. Following the
splashers, the riﬂemen cracked out a
1.449 target score, the boxers .climaxed
third place with a 1.428 total, and the
basketeers hit the hoop for a. 1.42’)
average. Cross—country, football, track
and wrestling round out the list in the
order named. None of the sport groups
went below a “C” average grade.

Charley Gangloff, while an active
participant in football, boxing and
track, earned an average of 2.43.
Gongloff was second only to James
Randazzo, varsity riﬂeman and Pitt

 

News reporter, who made a 2.46
average.

Compensate For
Leaner Seasons

 

Rivalry between students of the
University and Carnegie Institute of
Technology, the latter a school of
higher learning situated southeast of
the Cathedral across Panther Hollow
——a rivalry which has been whetted
in all branches of sport and one year
even culminated in a riot involving
police, students, urchins, hangers-on,
and technologists —— was continued
Friday afternoon in a. chess tourna-
ment, which Tech won 4 to 1, and one
match of which was just about as long
and drawn out as this here sentence.

Albert Brandon, Jr., an executive
in the University chess club, was the
only member of Pitt’s ﬁve man team
to place the bishops and castles in
such positions as to win his match.
Sidney Magram, Ben ‘Goretz, William
Sulzbacher, and James Steiner, un-
like University athletes, found Tech
Just too much for them.

Magram’s match involved the tradi-
tional chess strategy of much deliber-
ation before each move, and he ﬁnal-
ly lost after about three hours of
back and forth across the board. The
other matches consumed about an
hour each.

They had donned their tricky
caps and their blue and gold dress
capes. They straightened strag-
gling ends of coiffures and practiced
very best smiles,

But all in vain.

Miss Kitty Till, of the University
publicity department, had herded
the honorary coed captains of the
ROTC corps into position at Alumni
hall for the photograph to be used

The Photographer, unfortunately,
had been misled as to time and
place by a Military Ball biggie, and
the picture, alas, was never snap-
ped.

But the ten coeds did get a chance
to wear those natty outﬁts again.

Dr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson returns
to the campus tomorrow to prove to
students and faculty members that
the Arctic doesn’t have a leg to stand

ent policy of non intercourse. His
talk, “Abolishing the Arctic” will be
given at a general assembly tomor-
row at 10:30 o’clock in Memorial hall.
All classes will be omitted.

Stefansson is returning to the Uni-
versity at the express request of cer-

Funeral Today

The funeral of H. C. Mc-
Eldowney, University trustee,
who died early Saturday, will
be held from the Asbury M. E.
church at 4 o’clock this after-
noon.

Mr. .\lcEldowney had been on
the Board of Trustees since
1916.

Dr_ John G. Bowman, Chan-
cellor, told The Pitt News Sat-
u1'day:

“H. C. McEldowney was one
of the leading bankers in the
United States. He succeeded
because he knew how to make
a plan and to persist in carrying
it out. And always people in
Pittsburgh knew that integrity
and good citizenship were part
of his thinking. The University.
in Mr. McEldowney’s death,
loses a wise counselor, a good
friend and a good support.”

Frank Speaight
To Give Dickens
Program Today

British Actor To Impersonate
Characters From “Pickwick
Papers,’ ’ ‘ ‘ Copperﬁeld’ ’

University students won’t have to
wait for something to turn up when
Micawber. walks across the Heinz
House floor this afternoon. All Dick-
ens’ characters will be revolving at
top notch speed in the impersonations
which Frank Speaight, noted British
actor, will make for students and
faculty members in a program, spon-
sored by Pitt Players and scheduled
for !H.einz House at 2:30 o’clock.

-Speaight has called his program,
“An afternoon of ,Dickens’*humor” in
which he will draw his impersonations
from "David Copperﬁeld” and “Pick-
wick Papers.” From the beginning
of his career he decided to specialize
in the works of Charles Dickens.
Since then he has been engaged in re-
writing the scripts into monologues,
preserving the scenery and even the
costumes through his renditions.

Speaight enjoys the popularity that
comes to few artists. On his previous
18 tours of America he has built up
a following that ranges from girls’
schools to athletic clubs, from activ-
ity organizations to universities.
Year after year, on each return to
this country he is invited to revisit
the same places. He has been called
to the University of Chicago 32 times,
has addressed students at Columbia
18 times.

He has made three lectures in Pitts-
burgh during these American tours,
twice at the University club, and
again at the Twentieth Century club.

The program will be open to the
entire student body and faculty. There
will be no charge.’

Cap, Gown Cast ,
Given Vacation

No Work Scheduled For Group
Until Viehman Returns

The cast of the Cap and Gown show
will have a complete rest for about

 

' two weeks until The-odore Viehman re-

turns from Cambridge, where he is
supervising the staging of “Hasty
Pudding.”

V iehman, the scenerio director, left
Friday night for a stay of two weeks
at Harvard. He left orders with the
cast not to do anything with lines un-
til his return. He wants to direct the
reading himself and is afraid the fel-
lows may have to unlearn their lines
when he arrives. In a last minute
statement before he left for Cam-
bridge, he said: ,

“I am more than satisﬁed with the
progress of ‘In the Soup’ to date.
The show has a talented east and
with the chorus under Mr. Kel1y’s
supervision, I’m sure that we’ll be
able to turn out a well rounded pro-
duction.”

The chorus rehearsals will continue
in the meantime under Kelly’s direc-
tion. Tonight’s rehearsal, starting at
8 o’clock, in the Y hut, will start prac-
tice for the actual routines to appear
in the show.

Snappy Weather
We're Having

The University’s snap course
goes practical this week as the
members of Luke Swank’s news
photography class go about campus
taking pictures by the dozen.

"'VVhy dear me, I never took no
picture before in my life,” sighed
Don Campbell, new undergraduate
camera fanatic, “but my Speed-
graphic camera (look Mr. Swank, I
know the name of the dingus) just
worked ducky.”

Sally Isler, Bernie Fleming, Janet

-Savage, Andy Sable, Helen Mill-
iron, and many others, are now
cruising for artistici shots . .
and gently cussing the general
cloudiness of Pittsburgh’s atmos-
phere.

The embryonic photographers

are ﬁnding themselves extremely
popular among camera-shy friends,
who are ﬁghting for a chance to
play hide-go-seek with the proverb-
ial birdie.

Soldiers S e l e c t
Four Orchestras

Isham Jones, Ted Black Chosen
To Play For Military Ball

Two national and two local orches-
tras have been selected to play at the
Military Ball, Friday, M,arch 22, in the
Williaru. Penn hotel, according to
George Roll, Ed35, chairman of the
dance. Isham Jones and Ted Black,
both CBS broadcasting bands, are the
national orchestras. Baron Elliot and
Jack Logan are the locals.

Isham Jones and his 18-piece band.

' have played in the Ambassador hotel,

Atlantic City; the College inn, Chi-
cago; and the Hollywood restaurant,
New York City. Four years ago, be-
fore lie began to broadcast. he played
at the Pitt Interfraternity ball. Jones,
composer of the song, “VVe’re in the
army now,” specializes in novelty ar-
rangements and musical innovations.
Ted Black’s orchestra has broadcast
from the Village Barn in New York
City, and has played an eight month
engagement iii the Blue Room, a Paris
night club. His orchestra was the
first American (la.nce band to play in
Cuba.

Baron Elliot, now playing at the
Castle Farms, Cincinnati, will come
to Pittsburgh to play at the Ball, and
immediately return to Cincinnati.

where he succeeded Ted Lewis. Elliot,

has played at several University
dances, the most. recent being the
Heart IHop, all women’s dance, in
February. He has played at dances
in Tech, Penn State and Grove City.

Jack Logan, one of the orchestras at_

last year's Military Ball, has recently
played in Atlantic City and Cleve-
land.

The entire seventeenth floor of the
‘William Penn will be utilized for the
affair, from 10 to 2. A feature of the
ball will be combination favors, one
for the man and one for the woman.
This is the ﬁrst time in the recent
l1istory‘of the school that dual favors
have been presented at a, University
dance. The admission is $3 a
couple and tickets may be bought from
the committee, the Military ofﬁce,
Room 1101, Cathedral, and from mem-
bers of the ROTC,

In regard to the orchestras, Roll said,
“The committee feels that it has been
fortunate in securing the services of
Isham Jones as the leading orchestra
of the ball. \Vith four well known or-
chestras and combination favors, the
Military Ball will be the best dance
in the city this year.”

Men’s Glee Club Prepares

Action On Eight

  SFA Amendments

Planned Tomorrow

University Handbook, Assembly
Dance, Senior Dinner Will
Be Voted On First

Meet In Cathedral

Tomorrow evening the Univer-
sity Asscmbly will take ﬁnal
action on eight changes in its
constitution. Meeting in Room
1309, Cathedral, at its montlily
session, the groups will be asked
to approve each of the cliangcs by
a l.wo—thir(ls vote.

Again the student body is invited
to the meeting, which will begin at
7:30 o’clock. Presentation of plans
for an all—Unive1-sity handbook, the
second SFA afternoon dance, and a.
senior dinner just before graduation
day will be made before the amend-
ments are considered.

According to Leonard Marks, C35,
chairman of the SFA Executive com-
mittee, women’s organizations have
already agreed to a. uniﬁed Univer-
sity guide. Previous books have been
published separately ‘by the YMCA
and by a combination of VVSGA, XVAA,
Panhellenic Council and other groups.

Last spring, it is pointed out, sug-
gestions for a combined handbook
were made by both men’s and wo-
men’s representatives. Neither camp
could reconcile its viewpoint with the
other, however, a.nd two publications
were issued as usual last September.

The senior dinner idea. has been
proposed to give graduating students
the proverbial last get-together. Pro-
ponents of the project maintain that
the final social event should balance
the introductory banquet given enter-
ing freslimen.

The social committee will announce
its second dance scheduled at the Ho-
tel Schenley a week from today_ The
opening function, the ﬁrst student gov-
ernment-sponsored daytime affair,
made a slight proﬁt with an admit-
tance charge of 25 cents. Hours, it is
expected, will again be from 2:30 to
5:30 o’clock.

The story of the rise and fall of
the University newsreel theater will
be presented by a spokesman of the
-Executive committee. Likewise a.
statement on creditless and tuitionless
auditing of courses by seniors is an-
ticipated. Plans for new sports, as
well as a review of the intramural
basketball program, are listed in the
athletic commit.tee’s report.

A special body under Dr. James C.
Charlesworth, assistant professor of
political science, will introduce cor-
rected versions of the constitutional
amendments passed at ﬁrst reading
during the lfeliruary meeting. Miss
Theresa Kahn, instructor in English,
George Strong, C36, Roberta Nern,
C36, and Frank Reich, C36, assisted in
preparing the revisions.

Chief among‘ the innovations to be
passed upon is ' proportional repre-
sentation of Women. New represent-
ing one-third of the total undergrad-
uate enrollment, women would be
given one-third of University Assembly
and SFA Executive committee stu-
dent membership. '

‘Pitt News Style Show
Scheduled For April 3

The second Pitt News Style show
will take place on Wednesday, April
3, according to Ellis H. Tumpson,
business manager of the Pitt News.

Last November the News sponsored
a style show at the Hotel Schenley.
Models for the second show will be
chosen by a ballot which will appear
in the News. There will be dancing
after the show as at the last event.
The site for this year’s affair has as
yet not been selected.

Colored Lights Found To Be More
Soothing To Eye Than Natural Tints

“The light of the future will be pro-
duced from the incandescent glow of
certain elements with a view toward
color and efficiency.”

So stated Dr. Samuel G, Hibben of
the Westinghouse Lamp Company, in
an address before the initiation meet-
ing of Sigma Xi, national scientiﬁc
fraternity, last week. “For 300,000
years man has been experimenting
with different kinds of light,” he said,
“but for only three years have we had
lights of color.”

Exhibiting a green-yellow and a
blue-green mercury light, a bright
yellow sodium vapor bulb and an
orange neon light, Dr. Hibben showed
their various properties of soothing
the eye and distorting and emphasiz-
ing the natural colors.

“Those elements,” ,Dr. Hibben
stated, “which show the closest con-
sistency in their spectrum, having
their color lines nearest together, are
the ones which will most likely pro-
vide the illumination of the future,
We must look for zinc, mercury, cad-

mium, argon, sodium and neon to be
of the most service in this respect.”

A novel feature of Dr. Hibben’s ad-
dress was his demonstration of the
little-known “black light.” Projected
from a bulb with an opaque surface,
the light resembles a dark purple ef-
ﬂorescence which had the p1'0D8ITY
of reversing colors. A light tan tapes-
try with red and blue decorations
placed under the “black light’’ ap-
peared as a. bright yellow design
against a violet background.

Explaining the latest theory of the
source of light as the excitation of
c.le(:.tr0ns, the speaker claimed that
our light of the future will come, not
from the crystallized electricity of _the
atom, but from the unc1‘YSta1l1Z€(l
electricity which produced the light
he demonstrated.

Dr. Hibben studied a.t Carnegie
Tech, Princeton and the Sorbonne,
and was in charge of searchhghts

during the World war. He has since
been a research engineer with the
Westinghouse Lamp company.

OMOllRO\V NIGHT members

of SPA assembly will take it
upon themselves to decide wheth-
er women shall be given propor-
tionate representation with men
in that body next year, or wheth-
er they shall be largely left up at
Heinz House, while the men do
the legislating for them.

Already the University Assem-
bly has signiﬁed by a majority
vote its interest in seeing the
aniendment passed. The measure
\\'.=ls then referred to a. special
(-.om1ni1:tcc for revision and addi-
tion, and that committee has un-
aniinously recommenclecl passage
to the Executive committee of
SFA.

Tomorrow night the measure
should get the two-‘thirds vote
that  needed to adopt it. Cer-
tain. politicians, nevertheless, who
insist upon taking the welfare of
" ll University students into con-
sideration, decry the passage of
the measure on the grounds that
ii: would make a special faction
of women. These humanitarians
overlook the fact that special fac-
tions were born into SFA, special
factions whose purpose was the
inclusion of special groups to the
exclusion of others, before the
women sought to_ secure propor-
tional representation.

Yet certain members, who revel
in the self-applied title of cham-
pions of justice, decry the repre-
sentation of women 011 the
grounds that it will set up classes
in a class-less body. But while
trying to make a physiological di-
vision into a faction, they are
omitting the factions that are
created in fraternity parlors and
vacant rooms in Alumni hall.

As long as SEA has for its pur-
pose the legislation of matters af-
fecting students as a group, wo-
men should be included in its
membership. And they should
achieve proportional representa-
tion without having to barter for

Tomorrow night a large group

the proceedings which concern
them. But what will be engross-
ing to them is the grounds of

body will consider whether wo-

R. S. V. P.
E. RLY last month a small
group of students petitioned
the University Assembly for a
charter in behalf of a chapter of
the National Student League, and
the petition was delivered to the
proper committee for appraisal.

This committee approved the
petition and passed it on to the
Executive committee for conﬁr-
mation. The vote had been unan-
imous.

The Executive committee, by a
judgment certainly within its
privilege, reversed the ruling of
the first committee and will
doubtless report its action to the
whole Assembly at its monthly
meeting tomorrow night.

VVhen the Assembly is asked to
ratify this reversal, however, it
should compare the language of
the petition with the language of
the 1etter—from the Chairman of
the Executive committee —— in-
forming the petitioners of the
reversal.

The petition submits:

“If the University of Pitts-
burgh requires membership re-
stricted to University of Pitts-
burgh students and faculty mem-
bers, it can be done.”

Says the letter:

“This organization does not
meet the requirements for recog-
nition, since it has been the policy
of the Student Faculty Associa-
tion to limit organizations on the
campus solely to the University
of Pittsburgh student body.”

This language does not make
clear whether it is the national
affiliations of the League, or the
composite local membership from
Pitt, Tech and Duquesne, which
oﬁends the policy of the SFA.

Why was the "petition refused?

 

Therc’s An Old
Spinning Wheel
In Cathedraf

From a corner in a Conestoga wagon
bumping over the mud-rutted turn-
pikes of Pensylvania to a niche be-
side the fireplace of the Pennsylvania
Gernia‘.-1 memorial room in the Cathe-
dral. This, in brief‘, is the story of
the spinning wheel given the Univer-
sity by Mrs. 'l‘racy Guthrie of Se-
wickley.

The wllcel, made over a hundred
years ago, in Lav.;cast.c1' county, was
brought across the Allegheny moun-
tains froin Lancaster by the great
grandparents of Mrs. Guthrie, Mr. and
Mrs. Isaac Rank, in 1839, through
Pittsburgh to their own home, near
Columbus, Ohio. Here they grew their
own ﬂax, which the daughter of Isaac
Rank spun into sheets, -now in the
possession of Mrs. Guthrie. The spin-
ning wheel came into her possession
with an old family clock, which her
mother, Mrs. Susan Ellenberger Horn,
gave her.

Although deﬁnite plans are not com-
pleted for the Pennsylvania. German
room, the spining wheel will be set
in on one side of the ﬁreplace to
represent the work of the women in
the early days.

The Mail

Editor, The Pitt News:

Two weeks ago, a petition for a
charter was presented to the Organ-
izations Committee of the SFA by the
National Student League, a nonparti-
san group which “seeks to be the or-
ganized ev.pression of the needs of the
student body.”

he petition was unanimously ap-
proved by that committee. Then the
petition was forwarded to the Execu-
tive Committee for approval before
presentation for passage by the full
,Tniversity Assembly. On Marcli 8,
the Executive Committee privately re-
turned the National Student League.
petition to its sponsors because, “This
organization does not mee‘-.2 the or-
dinary requirements for recognition,
since it has been the policy of the
Student Faculty Association to limit
organizations on the campus solely to
the University of Pittsburgh student
body.”

Yet the petition contained the state-
ment that “if the University of Pitts-
burgh requires inembership restricted
to University of Pittsburgh students
and faculty members, this can be
done.”

Is the Executive committee attempt-
ing to evade giving other reasons for
its refusal of the National Student
League petition?

400,000,000 Years

A Cathedral of Learning 50,000
years ago would have been in the cen-
Ler of the Monongahela river.

A Cathedral 400,000,000 years ago
would have stood on the edge of a
warm, slimy sea out of which crept the
first land creatures.

And this same Cathedral 2,000,000,-
000 years ago would have looked out
over 3. hissing, crackling ball of ﬁre
which was the new earth just break-
ing away from another planet.

These facts Pitt geologists believe
today. The three dates represent va-
rious stages in the development of
Western Pennsylvania. About the
ﬁrst, Henry Leighton, head of the de-
partment of geology, said:

“The Monongahela river during
the pre-glacial era about 50,000
years ago flowed through this sec-
tion. We have definite proof from
the sediment and rock which we
find when any excavation is made.

“The river flowed directly
through the center of what is now
Pittsburgh, forming a shallow pond

or lake. Finally it out through its
channel and entered its present
course.”

Earthquakes probably
rock this region. Mr.
plained:

“The hills here have settled. The
Alleghenies are part of one of the
oldest ranges in the world, There

is no shifting, therefore no cause
for earthquakes.

“The Cathedral with its s*'eel
structure would be able to with-
stand the shock anyway, unless it
were in the direct path of the
fault.”

Huev Longfellow

Politics may make strange bedfel-
lows, but whatever happens, Dr. Rus-
sell J. Ferguson, history, feels certain
Huey Long will never end up as
R.oosevelt’s Secretary of State.

Dr. aFerguson, who stayed up half
the night to hear Huey answer John-
son, described the Senator from Louis-
iana as an “acute annoyance to the
administration but not quite a. dan-
ger.” He declared: ‘

“The address struck a vital point
which lifted it above the role of
mere demagoguery. It was a mix-
ture of common sense and show.
manship and was effective.’-'

LEAVES

Dr. Ferguson stressed the impor-
tance of two of Long's points:

1—tl1at 90 per cent of the wealth
is controlled by 4 per cent of the
people.

2—that the middle class is rapidly
declining.

“Long’s plan may be vague and
visionary,” the professor said, “but
his address did carry some irrefuta-
ble facts.”

Study in Germany

It seems the University is going to
turn down three scholarships offered
by the University of Munich because
no students who could afford a. round
trip across can be found.

The language department has a let-
ter from the German University o1fer-
ing for the first time three scholar-
ships to Pitt. The scholarships are
good for free tuition and for an exclu-
sive pric-3 of $58 all expenses includ-
ing transportatioil in Germany, room
and board.

The S. S. Columbus, sailing June 29,
has been scheduled for American stu-
dents. Third class rate would run
$231.50 round trip. The Columbus
will return August 18.

The four-weeks “lSommerkursc Fuel-

By Wednesday eight student au-

will have picked two out of 13 short
stories to send to Story magazine in
the national collegiate contest.

McCready Huston, journalism, ﬁrst
judge to read the stories, described
them as showing “an astonishing re-

action to the depression.” ‘He said:
“They indicate much thinking
about the material things. In judg-

ing them I have taken an editorial
attitude. I have thought of the
stories as most likely 13o find a pub-
lisher rather than from the angle
of formal construction."

James Van Trump, ﬁne arts, admit-
ted he would let “ﬁne, artistic writ-
ing” inﬂuence his decision. He stated:

“I will not judge the stories
strictly from the point of view of
salability. I have no prejudices
against any themes or styles, but
the story should be artistic.”

Charles Crow, English, a,lsC- declar-
ed “sal-ability would not be the de-
ciding factor” in his choice of the
winning manuscripts. He added:

“Persuasiveness with which the
story achieves its purpose will in-
fluence me more.”

Quill’s New Journeyman Commended,
Regular Literary Magazine Urged

By Edwin Banks
T LAST, after two years, the University has again managed to issue a

literary magazine, edited and written by students.

Today the Journey-

man, published by Quill club, Pitt literary group, and containing poetry,
short stories, essays, and other forms, of members and non-members, appears

on the campus.

The expression “managed" is not a reﬂection on the insufficient ef-

forts or composition by literary-minded University students.

The Present

issue of the Journeyman, 51 pages ol.¢

it, includes 47 articles selected from
more than -200 manuscripts submit-

ted. Surely, this is indication enoug
that creative

languishing in-
dustry at Pitt.

B e t t e r than
the quantity of‘
work in the mag-
zine is the qual-
ity. I spent the
better part of an
hour looking
over galley
proofs just be-
fore starting this
column, and I can
say honestly
that I think the

Edwin Banks -standard set by
this publication is high. Vvhich opin-
ion is a. startling admission from an

individual who is not a hired public-
ity agent and who has never lacked
the innnodesty or bad taste of ﬂicking
cigarette ashes over the pedestals of
literary immortals. I have dozed or
laughed over enough college maga-
zines of the Journeyman type to as-
sert thut ours compares with if not
surpasses the best of them.

Vvhile I hope that the Pitt magazine
will be accorded a reception 'Wl1lCh
will enable it to pay for itself‘, I can-
not see why its continued issuance
must depend on its ﬁnancial success.
When one of a uuiversity’s kecnest
ambitions it to achieve scholastic and
cultural distinction, I cannot see how
that institution can limit its student
publications to a. newspaper and 3
humor magazine. Because a ' maga-
zine does not offer attractive com-
n1-crcial possibilities does not mean
that it has no justification for ex-
istence.

The University has long been proud
of its English department, yet we are
forced to wait two or three years for
a student proof of that excellence. It
seems to me that the least Pitt can
do is to give its undergraduate writ-
ers an opportunity to show what their
school can produce. \Ve should have
a monthly or bi-monthly literary pub-
lication on the campus even if it does
entail a. certain amount of expense
by the administration. The money
certainly would be will spent.

Trackmen Show Power
In Winning CIC Meet

Fleming Ties Mark In Low-Hurdles Event;

Mile-Relay Team

Pitt athletes went, they ran, they conquered.

Sets New Record

That just about

tells the story of what the Panther track team did at South Bend, In-
diana, in the ninth annual Central Intercollegiate Conference indoor
meet held last Friday and Saturday at the Notre Dame ﬁeld house.
Accounting for two of the ﬁve new records made in the weel'-end
carnival, and having in Arvel Fleming the high-point scorer for the
meet, the Panthers scored 23 1-6 points to gain the team title and
trophy. N otre Dame ’s runners trailed behind in second place with a

:30 1-6 total.

.lLed by the brilliant Fleming and’

a great quarter-miler in Kiger, the
Panthers captured four ﬁrst places.
one second, and one tie for fourth
place to give them their score. Inci-
rlentally, the Olsonmen were respon-
sible for breaking one record and
equalling another.

Fleming. star sprinter and hurdler,
tied the accepted American record in
the 65-yard low hurdles, skimming
over the barriers in 7.2 seconds. This
also tied the mark for CIC indoor
competition. He gave the Panthers
another ﬁve points by winning the 60-
yarcl (lash from a fancy group of
sprinters in the fast time of 6.3 see-
onds. ‘Waite of ‘Washington univer-
sity was second, followed by Jordan
of Notre Dame. Fleming"s two ﬁrsts
gave him 10 points and individual
higli scoring honors

clock. Their new time was 3 min-
utes, 21.5 seconds which was just a

little too fast for the other teams.
and consequently. the Pitt anchor
man, Connelly. was some 25 yards

ahead of the Notre Dame runner at
1,119. ﬁnish.

Fred Kiger took time off from his
relay work to turn in a nice race in
the 440-yard dash, getting himself a

ﬁrst place. He breezed the quarter
in 50.2 seconds to beat out Ford.
lvestern State: Jessel, Marquette;

and Bernard. Notre Dame.

In the only other event in which
Pitt scored points, Cy Pelucha was
forced to take second place to Sie-
hert of North Central who soared to
a new mark of 13 feet, 5% inches in
the pole vault. Johnson, Pitt sopho-
more. tied for fourth place with ﬁve
other vaulters.

Navy’s classy boxers continued
their string of conquests by defeat-
ing the Panthers 61/; to 1% in their
match at the Stadium Saturday night.
The Pitt ringmen showed a decided
improvement over the exhibition
which they gave against Vvisconsin,
and the match was a lot closer than
the score indicates.

Two technical knockouts were a
feature of the evening's entertain-
ment. Paslowski of Pitt scored one
of them, when the Navy seconds
tossed in the towel in the third round
to save Rawlins, the Middie represen-
tative in the 125-pound class. Michel,
of the Midshipmen, was credited with
the other in his bout with Joe Kopp.
Kopp’s tough luck is still pursuing
him, for after ﬂooring Michel in the
ﬁrst round, he suffered a cut over his
eye and Referee Chester Smith award-
ed the bout to Michel.

Captain Jimmy Giannatti kept his
record intact by gaining a draw with
Blitch. Bernie Speigel, Panther wel-
terweight, suffered his ﬁrst defeat of
the year when he dropped a tough
decision to fl-locker.

Cats Tame Lions
In Cage Struggle

Emrick Is High-Scorer Again,
Gets 15 Points In Triumph

After the Lions had done a little
marauding for the ﬁrst 10 minutes of
the ball game, the Panther cagers
turned on the power and left Penn
State far behind in a 41-25 battle at
State College Saturday night.

For the second time in as many
games, Ross Emrick, sophomore
guard, showed the way for both
teams in scoring. This time the

head Lion-tamer made ﬁve ﬁeld goals
and ﬁve fouls for a grand total of 15
points. Mike Kornick, formerly of
Perry high, slipped in four of each for
a 12-point total.

The Lions started off with a rush,
piling up a 3-0 lead, but the Panthers
pulled up and when ﬁve minutes had
passed each team had ﬁve points.
Cribbs and Emrick counted ﬁeld goals
and Noon added a foul to send Pitt
ahead, but a ﬁeld goal by G-lennon
and three foul shots made it all even
again when. 12 minutes were up.

It was right at this moment that
the Pitts ushered the Lions straight
into their cages and then proceeded
to do very much as they pleased. At
the end of the half the Pantliers were
sporting a 23-14 lead.

Kornick tried to start something
again in the second half by making
good ona long one-handed shot, but
Ralph Ferguson evened that one up
by a basket from out around the foul-
circle. Emrick and Jesko scored for
Pitt and Kornick and Frank Smith
kept things even for State. The next
ﬁve minutes were devoted to rushing
up and down the ﬂoor without any-
thing much coming of it for either
team.

State started to go again and
brought the score to 34-25 but Emrick
sunk a ﬁeld goal and foul while Skip
«Hughes addedaﬁelder to set the Lions
back on their heels. Claire Cribbs
cracked the whip for the ﬁnishing
touch, his ﬁeld goal bringing the Pitt
total to 41.

Franklin and Marshall college’s
crack swimming team with 32 points
won the annual Eastern Collegiate as-
sociation championship swimming
meet at the Carnegie Tech pool Sat-
urday.

Franklin and Marshall won four of
the nine events, including the 300-

yard medley relay, and the 4-00-yard -

relay. The Panther natators account-
ed for their 20 points by placing in
ﬁve events in which they won one
ﬁrst. two seconds, and three fourths.
Lindberg was second in the 440-yard
freestyle; Ruhe fourth in‘ the 50-yard

freestyle; Denny second in the 100-
yard freestyle; Jones fourth in the
15-0-yard backstroke; while Myers

ﬁnished fourth in the fancy-diving
event, which was won by McQuillan
of Pitt.-

McQuillan, Coach Corr’s ace repre-
sentative in the fancy diving event,
won the Pa.nther’s lone ﬁrst place,
despite the fact that he was handi-
capped by a broken toe which he suf-
fered in the afternoon trials.

The Pitt swimmers were barely
nosed out of two other ﬁrst, places.
Captain Denny was defeated by inches
in the 100-yard freestyle by Stoufflet
of Lafayette, and Russ Lindberg lost
a heart-breaking race to Steinberg of
City ‘College of New York after lead-
ing all the way. ,

The Pitt freshmen placed third in
the 200-yard freshman relay which
was won by Rutgers, with Carnegie
Tech taking second.

Solow Wins First
Ping Pong Affair

Defeats Brosius In Tight Battle
As University Tourney Ends

Before a fair-sized audience, Irwin
Solow, Pitt frosh, became the ﬁrst
University ping pong champ, defeat-
ing Bill Brosius in a four-game strug-
gle in the ﬁnal round of the table ten-
nis tournament played ?Friday after-
noon in the Cathedral. The scores
were 21-17, 22-20, 21-23, 21-15.

Solow, co-sponsor of the newest
Pitt sport along with Mr. Feeley, won
the right to meet Brosius in the finals
by defeating both Hank Haller and
Ray Ehrman earlier in the day. He,
beat Haller in a quarter-ﬁnal round
game, 21-15, 21-17, and then went on
to win a hard—fought contest with
Ehrman by scores of 21-17, 21-19, 21-15.

Brosius had to eliminate Lefty Gren-
nan in the semi-ﬁnals to enter the
ﬁnals. He beat Grennan by scores of
21-16, 21-14, 14-21, 21-12.

Ehrman won the consolation prize
by nosing out Grennan in a three—game
battle, 21-17, 20-22, 21-15.

These four pingers, together with
one other player, will likely make up
the Pitt ping pong team which will be
entered in a city table league.

Final results of match play:

Final round: Irwin Solow defeated

William Brosius, 21-17, 22-2 , 21-23,
21-15.

Semi-ﬁnals: Solow beat Ehrman,
21-17, 21-19, 21-15; Brosius defeated

Grennan, 21-16, 21-14, 14-21, 21-12.

Seniors Will Plan
Two Innovations
At M u s t e r D a y

Boat Excursion After Graduation
Rites, Luncheon For Soph
Coeds, To Be Proposed

To Choose Final Dress

A proposed boat excursion and
dance on the night of Commencement
and a hint heon for sophomore women
on April 15 are two innovations that
senior women will consider during
their Muster day on Wednesday after-
noon and evening at Heinz House.
Muster day, jointly sponsored by
the academic dress committee of
WSGA and the senior class, is in-
tended to orient senior women to the
traditional senior social events, to
enable them to make ﬁnal selection of
the required academic dress, and to
plan additional affairs for the re-
maining two months of school.

As an introductory talk to the
senior style show, Dr. Florence Tea-
garden, professor of psychology, will
discuss “How and why to wear
academic dress.” In the style show
which will follow, a detailed descrip-
tion of each dress will be given.

After all models have been displayed
there will be a rapid show of dresses
and women will indicate the most
popular styles. A review of the de-
tails of the remaining dresses, a pre-
ferential ballot to select the one or
two best—liked dresses, and the
academic dress for the class of 1935
will have been selected.

Following the buffet supper, which
is to be a part of Muster day, senior
women will see a display of the cor-
onation gowns.

Miss Thyrsa W, Amos, dean of wo-
men, will then discuss “The meaning
of coronation.” Copies of “The Point-
er,” a handbook listing senior events
and the approximate expense, will be
distributed to each member of the
senior class. The booklets, to be bound
in brown leatherette, will be dis-
tributed free of charge.

In charge of the Muster day style
show and buffet supper are Frances
McLaughlin, chairman of the academic
dress committee, Martha Green and
Marjorie Reich.

Emerald Luncheon

Juniors Celebrate St. Patrick’s
Day With Affair Monday

The Pitt

WAA Members Go Terpsichorean
With ‘Jumble Dansettes’ Cabaret

Jumble Dansettes is the name of
IVAA’s annual merrymaking cabaret,
to take place March 20 at Heinz

sented on the program are the In-
dian ceremonal dance, tap, ballet,
American and folk dancing steps, and
the modern dance rhythms. The pro-
gram committee plans to present some
vocal soloists, and several solo dances.

be chosen today and rehearsals will
take place all this week. Tickets will
go on sale today, at 35 cents, and
may be purchased at the sandwich
stand in Alumni hall or on the tenth
ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

able in Heinz House, both for serving

will speak tonight to those executives
enrolled in the “Executive problems

cision and its inﬂuence on recovery.”

The course, under the direction of
Dr. David R. Craig, director of the
Bureau, is but one of four offered by
the Retail Bureau for professional re-
tailers and department store employes
in its annual Retail Institute. '

The courses, in which approximate-
ly 450 are enrolled, are presented each

trol our world?” This course, offered

Campus Climbs
Prove Excellent
Weight Reducer

By Bob Saffron '

Girls! Do you realize that you are
taking a weight reduction treatment
here at no extra cost—by walking
around the school? Doctors say that
walking uphill is just the thing for
that sylph-like silhoutte, and you cer-
tainly have a chance to climb at Pitt.

According to a topographical map
in the department of buildings and
grounds, you climb almost a hundred
feet vertically to go from Thaw hall

to Alumni. And if you have a class in
the Cathedral and then in the gym,
you pant up a height of 235 feet
(about equivalent to 16 floors of the
Cathedral), and walk a little less than
three-fourths of a mile to boot.

At this rate you will have ascended.
a height almost equal to 13 times that
of the «Empire State building and trot-
ted something like 40 miles to com-
plete one year of gym.

And so, you see, there really is no
need to diet.

Monthly Business Review
Shows Recovery Periods

A special study of three recovery
periods since the summer of 1932, the
results of which are contained in this
month’s issue of the “Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Review,” monthly publication of
the Bureau of Business Research, in-

dicates that early in February business 1

activity in the United States had
reached a level slightly. higher than
it attained on the rise in the ﬁrst half
of last year.

The ﬁrst recovery period since 1932
began March, 1933, and extended to
August, 1933, with a low level of 60.0
in the United States and 39.5 in Pitts-
burgh. The high of the period was
86.4 and 78.1, respectively, for the
coun_try as a. whole and for Pittsburgh.
The general recovery lasted about 17
weeks, while the local one was of 22
weeks’ duration.

The second recovery extended from
Jalllla-1')’. 1934, until June, 1934. The
index for the entire country rose from
76.3 to 85.1, whereas the Pittsburgh
level increased from 52.4 to 74.8. The
pickup extended for 23 weeks locally,
one more week than for the United
States.

Ides of March
At Celebration

Novel Verses Devised For Party
As Group Plans To Cast
Superstition To Winds

Wednesday Date Set

“March, the month of Ides fantastic;
VVednesday, day of omens drastic;
Thirteenth, be thou double wary
All of this need cause no worry,

If you to the the Cathedral hurry,
And ride to the 36th at three.-thirty
VVhere YVVCA friends will make

merry.”

Shades of Caesar's ghost! What
manner of thing is this? Merely the
way the campus YWCA has chosen
to foretell a novel party on Wednes-
day afternoon at 3:30 o’clock on the
36th ﬂoor of the Cathedral».

At that time, members will cast
aside all superstitions for the sake of
an “Ides of March” party. Just; to
prove that there is nothing about a
silly superstition, each person will be
required to step under a ladder as
the initial step in strewing care to
the winds.

The invitations, which were mailed
last week, are adorned with black
cats and a ladder running diagonally
across the card.

Novel entertainment will include a
parody, “Murder of Indifference,”
written by Jane Little. All songs and
games will carry out the superstiti-
tious theme of the party. Guests will
come upon black cats in unexpected
places, and there will be horseshoes
and four-leafed clovers as well.

According to the chairman of the
party, “Roman refreshments” will be
served. The “Ides of March” event,
intended for the entire membership,
will be considered as the regular as-
sociation meeting for .‘March.

Sally Thomas, Ed35, and Frances
Unseld, C36, chairmen of the member-

co-chairmen of the affair. Their re-
spective committee members will as-

Pre-Legal Group
Will Tap Women

J. Marshall Club- Breaks-Tradition
In Giving Coeds Equality

The complete equality of women on
the campus approaches reality, with
the announcement that the John Mar-
shall club will tap women as well as
men.

“Tlie main purpose of this organ-
ization,” stated Miles Jones, assistant
professor of ‘business law and spon-
sor, “is to introduce to pre-legal stu-
dents the ethics of law, the functions
and courses of the School of Law ﬁnd
the opportunities afforded in the ﬁeld
of law. We feel that because so many
women are planning to take law work
they should have an equal chance
with men to learn about their chosen
ﬁeld.”

“VVe were unanimous in amending
the constitution to admit women,”
said Don Campbell, C35, vice presi-
dent. "I think that women will liven
things up and represent a distinct as-
set to our organization.” ‘

John Marshall is an honorary fra-
ternity open to all pre-legal students
with scholastic average of 1.7 and 45
quality points.

The officers for this year, besides
Campbell, are, James Boyle, C35, pres-
ident, and Emanuel Krupp, BA36, sec-
retary-treasurer.

the trial, open to all members of the
unit, will be held tomorrow in Room
215, Alumni hall, from 12:30 to 1:30
o’clock and from 3:30 to 5.

Tentative plans for the trial include
a speech from the plaintiff to prove
that the modern girl is precocious,
“swell-headed,” and irresponsible due
to her youth. St.ar defense witness
will be “Mrs. Youth," mother of a
1938 freshman, who was in the class
of 1898 herself.

Tomorrow evening at 6 o’clock mem-
bers of Sessertaro will hold a joint

Flash.’ ‘Heart
Hop’ Announces

$162. 65 Profits

After only one month, the ﬁnancial
returns for the Heart Hon have been
announced. Each class will receive
exactly $40.65, according to Frances
McLaughlin, chairman of the dance.
The net receipts for the affair were
$162.65, with the amount divided
equally among the four classes.

The original plan of apportioning
the money according to the number of
tickets sold by the representatives of
each class has been abandoned be-
cause of the great number of tickets
sold to faculty members and at the
door.

Both the Hop and the Heart will
be traditional, according to Miss Me-
Laughlin. The heart through which
the dancers passed when entering the
ballroom has been saved and will be-
come a part of each succeeding
dance.
