UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Cheating Forum Finds No Solution

  
 

By VICKIE EPSTEIN
A panel considering aca-
demic integrity found no an-
swer Wednesday afternoon
to the question “Why Not
Cheat.” The group could only
conclude that cheating is a
long-range problem that will
take a long time to solve.
Members of the panel at
the Student Union Board’s
Forum were Dr. Alan C. Rankin,
vice chancellor_ of student and
general affairs; Helen Pool Rush,
dean of students; ‘Dr. Richard C.
Tobias, assistant professor of Eng-
lish; Karen Woolf, president of!
Mortar Board, and Jay. Adlers-
berg, president of Alpha Epsilon
Delta, the ‘pre-medical honorary.
‘The two students believe that
there is academic dishonesty on
the carnpusrbut disagree on the
extent of this cheating. Adlers-
berg considered cheating wrong
because it lowers the value of the
course, makes the course appear
easier and throws the curve off.
Dr. Tobias never stated whether
students cheat or not but he re-
garded the professor as an edu-
cator, not a proctor. Dr. Rankin
added that morality is declining
but the “younger generation isn’t
going to the dogs.”
Audience Comments
The small audience listened to
the panel and added comments
on the problem of cheating but
tailed to reach a solution. The
University policy is “opposed to
academic dishonesty” said Dr.
Rankin and added that this poli-

There will be no Homecoming ﬂoats this year, because
the fraternities have fallen one short in providing the seven

last week. Seven fraternities had decided to build six ﬂoats

Litchfield Wants
Student Ideas,
Asks for Action

By JOSEY GROSSMAN

Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld told student leaders at a
luncheon that their comments, criticism, and constructive
proposals meant as much as if they came from Vice-chan-
cellor Alan Rankin or himself. _ _ ”

“We cannot be sensitive or defensive about these ideas,
he explained in answer to Student Goverment President
John Vrana’s thank you for admimstrative co-operation this
year. “If we can’t accept these, we might as well move over
and let you run the schoo .” _ , _ “ ,

“Don’t thank me for hstening, ’ he said, We re all after

the same thing. If invoicing, for instance, was as 7

poor as it obviously was, Mr. Monnet will cor-
rect it.”

"of business affairs. _

Special announcements and answers to student
queries included the following areas:

STUDENT UNION PLANS: Construction of two
new Towers dormitories including a new Student
Center will start in the fall of 1965 with projected
completion in the fall of 1967. They will be 10-
. V cated near the present Towers but the exact lot

LITCHIi'lELD ‘ cannot be announced until all the land is secured.

The Student Center will probably consist of four ﬂoors, two and
one-half above ground and one-half below a podium supporting the
Towers. All student activity offices and . recreation areas will ' be
moved there from Schenley Hall which will then be converted to
a.-Professional center.

    

The two new Towers will provide 1-.200 additional dormitory ' '

spaces. Entrance to the Towers for the residents will be separate from-
the main access to the Student Center though there will be another,
entrance within the Towers as well.

PARKING: The Chancellor announced that there are three ma-

jor parking developments in various stages of planning to alleviate A

Oakland parking congestion and the increased inconvenience from
the newly installed parking meters.

One will deﬁnitely be in the -Medical Center area since Monte-
ﬁore Hospital's new addition knocked out parking facilities on that
part of the hill. The city Parking Authority is working with the Medi-
cal Center on this project, which should be completed by next year,
as well as twolother lots as yetlto be designated.

REGISTRATION AND ADVISING: In reply to student complaint
about fall registration confusion and the “understaffed and under-
informed” Liberal Arts.Advising Center, the Chancellor said, “We

drop the construction unless fra-
ternities signed up to build a
minimum of seven ﬂoats. Presi-
dent Norm Hiines expressed the
group feeling that “If we are not
going to make a good showing,
we shouldn’t show at all.”
Himes explained that many fra-
ternities felt that the proposal
did not eliminate all the problems
inherent in ﬂoat-building. “For
example,” he said, “the expense
involved is one big item. We
have to rent the trucks as well as
pay for all materials involved in
the actual construction.”
Committee Regrets
Speaking for the Homecoming
committee, Chairman Smith com-
mented: “We regret the fact that
there will be no Homecoming
ﬂoats, but there was nothing
more we could do about it.” We

still have plans for the Greeks to _

display their spirit, but they will
not involve construction of any
kind‘)!

The theme for Homecoming’
has been changed from “Sour
Sixties” to “Famous Firsts.”
Bobby Rydell, described by

Smith as a “night club performer
who appeals to young adults,”
will replace Bobby Vinton in the
Friday night program -at Carne-
gie Music Hall. He will join
Jackie Vernon and the Mandrell

isingersonstage.‘

Student Affairs Comm. F wvors 2 — Day Pause

AFFAIRS—Page 1—Pitt News—3 col lead ‘ .
The Student Affairs Committee has recommended to acting Dean of Liberal Arts

and Dean of the Graduate Faculties Putnam Jones that students be given a two day read- V

ing period before the start of ﬁnal exams.
At the meeting Tuesday, Men’s Dorm Council President Harvey Lefton announced
that the Council had unanimously recommended to the Affairs Committee to secure “a

breather, a coupie days to syn-
thesize the knowledge of the
term” before ﬁnals.

Dean of Students Helen Rush
commented that “this interest on
the part of the students is indica-
tive of a changing student body
of increased academic quality.
Perhaps we haven't kept pace
here.”

Fall Calendar Set

Since the calendar for the year
is already set and the professors
have outlined their course lec-
tures for this term, the Commit-
tee suggested that instituting the
reading period before the April
ﬁnals weeks should be consider-
ed. Dean Jones assured them that
he would check with the faculty
and look into the technicalrfacets
of the change to report back to
the Committee as soon as pos-
sible.

When questioned about the
Liberal Arts advising staﬂ.
Dean Jones answered that he
considered it an “effective or-
ganization and better than any
other in the country."

He explained that the 14 un-
derclass advisors are carefully
selected for the two-year appoint-
ment upon faculty nomination
and interview by_ the Chairman
of the Board of Advisors, James
Watson, Russell Dixon, assistant
dean, and himself. The Chairman
orients them so that they are
“very well-informed.”

Unfortunately, the upper class
advisors in the 20 - odd major
fields are not so well ‘versed.
Within the last ten days, Dean
Jones reports, he and Watson
have met with these men for a
careful examination of the advis-
ing structure. -

ID Cards Held’
At Field House

Students who have had their
photographs taken but have not
received their identiﬁcation cards
may pick up the cards by present-
ing a validated invoice at the
ticket office in the main entrance
of Fitzgerald Field House. I

Students who did not have
their photographs taken may ap-
ply for an I.D. card if they pres-
ent a 1%”x11/4” photograph, a
validated invoice, and one dollar

at the ticket office. It will take 7

approximately one week to re-

A Parking Meters  NeXt
; To Cathedral Due
 I Within Two Weeks

E ..y..,-, .. ,, _: "(L355 “Mm  

J4 - am

 2 s . .

TEE PARKING METER, violation, and ticket are becoming as com-
’ mon a sight on campus as the Cathedral itself. Here the meter maids

   

  

have struck again and left their calling card for the unwary commuter.

Within two weeks, students will have to pay to park
their‘ cars in the Schenley Plaza and in spaces adjacent to

the Cathedral.

By that time, the City hopes to have meter heads at-

tached to the recently-installed .

meter posts in both areas.

_ A spokesman for the City Traf-
tlc Planning division said that
the meters were being installed
to “encourage more efficient use
of street space.” In the past, stu-
dents reportedly have parked
their cars in the Plaza and Cathe-
dral areas over the weekend and
have tied up parking space.

When the meters are in oper-
ation, parking in the Plaza will
be for four hours and $.10 for
two hours around the Cathedral.

The meter installation is part

' of the City's parking-crackdown

began on September 14 when six
meter maids were assigned to
patrol Oakland streets and ticket

- overtime parkers.

Since then, the finance depart-
ment said, the weekly intake
from meters in the Oakland area
has increased 32 to 33 per cent.

After a trial period in Oakland,
some of the meter maids will be
transferred to other parts of the

FORUM

cy “isn't clear.” The vagueness is
caused by each department's han-
dling of cases of cheating instead
of one central office, or group of
students and faculty.
The questions discussed were:
1) The values of our society
are not particularly unique, for
all education implies excel-
lence. The question is how the
goal is being achieved, and
evaluated. Is there a real prob-
lem of a lack of academic hon-
esty in the student body today?
Adlersberg cited the deﬁnition
of cheating from the Official
Handbook of the University: de-
pendence upon the aid of others
beyond that approved by the in-
structor in writing papers, pre-
paring laboratory reports, solv-
ing problems, or carrying out
other assignments; plagarism of
any sort; cheating on quizzes,
tests and examinations; permit-
ting another student to use one’s
works as his own.
Not a Cancer
Members of the audience call-
ed cheating widespread, and a
spreading and major problem but
not a “campus cancer.” One stu-
dent thought distribution courses
cause more cheating than sub-
jects in a major ﬁeld of study.
Miss Woolf considered dis-
honesty “the easiest way to
get :a diploma. and 50 .” She
blamed the temptation to cheat
on the environment. But a stu-
dent in the audience consider-
ed cheating justifiable for a
lawyer forced into a course in
physics for example. Both Miss
Woolf and Aldersberg disagreed.
2) Is there a lack of concern
among a portion of the faculty in
regard to their roles as educa-
tors?

 

  

1115:;-errata rem ma age. rs

‘dents. that “you are here as stu- I

dentsl If you don’t want to be a
student, good-bye.” 3) Does the
administration have a policy that
evaluates a professor on both his
excellence in research, as well as
his merits as a teacher?

b Re-evaluation

The policy stated about should
be united with continuous re-
evaluation of school and curricu-
lum and continous growth in in-
tellectual caliber of students, ac-
cording to one student.

Dr. George L. Fahey, profes-
sor of psychology, chairs the
faculty committee considering
cheating. He hopes to present
a. document suggesting a policy
for the University.

4) Assuming the answers to the
ﬁrst three questions point up a
ﬂaw in our educational system,
why does it exist? Is it inherent
in our system? Can it be effec-
tively altered without altering
the entire system?

The professor who fails to mo-
tivate the student forces student
apathy commented one student.
But a student respects the course
and the information when a pro-
fessor inspires him.

Source of Proble

Dean Rush traces ‘cheating to
the emphasis on grades, not on
learning while Adlersberg blamed
three levels for the problem of

cheating. They .are the students.

seeking only grades, the teacher
and the administration.

“Something is happening here that we should have expected,” he.
' continued. ‘“With a morecosmopolitan, ‘out-of-state, higher academic

quality student body, the demandﬂfor more personal, ‘competent ad-
vising will naturally be greater. '

 ‘I know we don’t have enough advising staff,” the Chancellor
went on. “When we started. we didn’t have any but the ratio has
gotten better every _year. Maybe this is the year to accelerate, it all
depends on the budget.”

He asked Dr. Rankin to contact Dr. Charles Peake, vice chancel-
lor of the academic disciplines‘, and Dean Putnam Jones, acting dean
of the Liberal Arts, for the matter to be brought up at Wednesday’s
staff meeting.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: When asked about the possibility for a
string University statement on academic integrity, the Chancellor an-
swered, “I can’t tell you how many faculty committees I’ve appoint-
ed to do this. I’ve almost concluded that this is as perennial a prob-
lem as parking.” A

Several students explained the campus interest in promoting
such a policy, a more explicit one than the general statement in the
Student Handbook, and cited the Wednesday Forum Series panel

' discussion on cheating sponsored by the Student Union Board.

,1 Chancellor Litchﬁeld directed Dr. Rankin to make sure Dr. George
Fahey submits the faculty statement of policy on integrity which he
has been working on to,the next University Senate meeting. “This
may even be a time for students to sit in on the meeting,” the Chan-
cellor added. , ,

‘‘Let’s really try to get something out of this Senate Committee
this time,” the Chancellor “concluded. “Everyone is in favor of hon-
esty but we’re facing divergent views and values of the faculty. They
cherish their independent position in the classroom so we must per-
suade not order them to accept a general system of dealing with dis-

~ honesty. This is indeed a justiﬁable complaint and high time We got

soniething done.”
FACULTY HOUSING: The Chancellor showed the group artist’s

— drawings of a proposed group of faculty houses for senior members
near his own home on "Warwick Terrace. The 11 to >12 “relatively '
expensive” traditional homes will hopefully be completed by next fall.’

Plans for faculty housing alsoi ‘include renovated homes and

I apartments ;in_ different parts of the city with the whole program

providing "a. great aid in recruitment.”

   The Well - Distributed

  _

‘aw-z'=— =

By LARRY BERNFELD

At least once a year, a Pitt News columnist
awakens the dormant, but never dead issue
of the school of liberal arts’ distribution of
study requirements. Let’s make it twice in
as many weeks.

Columnist Irv Garfinkel complained in
the October 12 issue of this paper that the

   H at ._ distribution requirements
are too rigid. He did not
attack the system, but one
particular aspect. Intro-
» ductory survey courses
have become nearly syn-
onomous with distribution
courses especially in the
social sciences and the
humanities.

Garfinkel’s specific
‘problem concerned the
economics distribution
course. Let’s start there.
~ The 80 and 180 courses in
economics are surveys designed for students
interested in a termi'nal course in this field.
Garfinkel wanted to replace Economics 180
with Econ 11, a core course in economic the-
ory. This course, concerned basically with the
broader study\ known as macroeconomics, can

-be followed by Economics 12, a second theory

course which examines microeconomics and

. international trade.

FOR A STUDENT with more than a sur-
vey interest in economics, 11 and 12 when
taken together will not only present him with
the basi'c body of economic theory and metho-

dology in which he is interested, but it will._

most likely cover the concepts and current
economic issues discussed in the 80’s and 180’s
courses.

.Garfinke1 wanted distribution for 11 in-

stead of 180. The rules say that when an 80>

or 180 course is in existence, it must be taken
for distribution. Almost all departments now
offer the distribution series, so Garfinkel has
no choice-

The theory behind the distribution cours-
es is not at question here. The question that
arises is whether Garfinkel was treated fairly.
I say he was not. In fact, I submit that he is
being punished. He and many other serious
students are, at the same time, a victim of
circumstance and a rulebook that has differ-
ent laws for different students.

First, the circumstance.

I RECEIVED distribution credit for Eco-
nomics 11. Why can’t Garfinkel? Because
when I took Econ 11, there was no 180’s
course. And with luck in my favor, I planned
it that way-

I had considered studying economics as
a sophomore, but I didn’t want to take the 80’s
course. At the time Econ 180, the upperclass
distribution course, was just a gleam in some-
one’s eye. Buried somewhere among the Rules,
is a small-print clause which allows an upper-
classman (60 credits or more) to substitute a
core course numbered 10 to 69 for the distri-
bution requirement when the 180’s course does
not exist in that field.

To my great relief, when I became a jun-
ior there still was no 180’s course. I proceed-
ed to take Economics 11 and 12, and received
distribution credit for 11. All perfectly legi-
timate, and according to the Rules.

Garfinkel, unfortunately, did not decide
to take his economics courses until it was too
late. Someone- more than graciously, had
ﬁlled the upperclass distribution gap, not only
in economics, but also in the other social sci-
ences where such courses had not existed be-
fore.

FEW STUDENTS complain that they
can’t take core courses for distributionsin .the

 

natural sciences. If anything, humanities and.

social science students in the past sought the 

survey 80’s courses rather than being forced to
take the lab science core courses for distribu-
tion. Now the Natural Science Departments
offer both core and 80’s courses for distribu-
tion.

Why the choice in the natural sciences?
Someone once explained to me that natural,
science students, especially those in pre-med,
have many requirements to ﬁll for graduate‘
school that are above and beyond the call of
their undergraduate curriculum Chemistry
11 is offered for distribution so the pre-med
students, among others, can take the seeming-
ly limitless prescribed credits in science which
will make them eligible for graduate school
while still allowing them to ﬁll their distribu‘-—
tion requirements without undue repetition
of courses.

Why should not this same choice be of-
fered to the social scientist? To the future
historian, political scientist and lawyer? Cer-

tainly a solid foundation in economics can be _

as valuable to the graduate student studying
the politics of developing nations, as a foun-r
dation in chemistry is to the medical student.

A SOLUTION TO this problem, is not as

simple as the problem’s presentation. How 1

does one distinguish between a student of
serious intent and one looking for “just an-
other way out?”? '

The liberal arts cabinet is conducting an
investigation of the 80’s courses. Distribu-
tion of studies has been a topic at student af-
fairs meetings. The advising center re-exam-
ines and adjusts requirements from time to
time.

Distribution courses and personal inter-
ests are not incompatible. These courses
should, not only in breadth, but in depth, of-
fer a choice, not an echo. , .

By NANCY DELANEY 

The University may de-
molish the “glaring hot dog
stand on the corner,” but it
will not forget it; for the
University is aiming for high
goals. It recognizes that edu-
cation is more ‘vital than a.

 mere game of
chess, a pleas-
ant intellect-
ual exercise
to delight the
participants.
It recognizes
and accepts
the responsi-
'   bility for lead-

DE!-ANEY ership con-
comitant with education. It
strives not only to raise stan-
dards within its own aca-
demic walls, but also to raise
the standards of environ-
ment of which it is a past.

It is willing to shoulder
the problem of knowledge
availability, to pioneer in the
increasingly important ﬁelds
of space research, linguistics,
and in land oceonography,
and it involves itself in phy-
sical redevelopment and in-
dustrial research. It‘ directs
its creativity toward respon-
sible leadership. Yet, if it
does not produce students
who can do the same, it has
failed.

IF THE STUDENTS of
the University are permitted
to ignore the problem of the
glaring hot dog stand on the

 

. corner during their sojourn

here, the University is noth-
ing more than an expensive
chess board. It the students
are encouraged to forget
everything for four years ex-
cept Kant’s categorical im-

 

perative and Einstein's for-
mula for rest mass, the cur-
riculum is amiss. If the stu-
dents of the University are
allowed to build their own
sterile world within the

white walls of their tow_er- ,

ing dormitories, the Univer-
sity has failed.

When Chancellor Litchﬁeld
awards a degree to a grad-
uating senior, he awards it
with all the “rights, priv-
ileges, and responsibilities”
accruing thereto. The stu-
dent should not accept the

degree unless he accepts the »

conditions under which it is
awarded. He cannot ignore
his responsibility.

NOR CAN THE Univer-
sity ignore its duty to pro-
duce responsible students-. A
sheet of parchment cannot
be expected to carry with it

the complex and mature at-
_titudes necessary for suc-

cessful self-regulation. These
attitudes must develop and-
grow with an individual;
they cannot be foisted upon
him ready-made. It takes
practice. And students un-
used to creative actions, to
self-enforced discipline, and
to inner- motivated values,
cannot possibly be expected
to unwaveringly confront the
the challenges of responsi-
ble adulthood.

It seems that students,
especially those who have
proven themselves of effec-
tive, responsible self-regula-
tion in selected areas of stu-
dent life, should be encour-
aged to extend self-discipline

. #9 811. ﬂeas. rather. tli§n.to.. _

  

continue to lean on external _

regulation.

As adults, no such crutch-
es will be available to them;
eliminating dependence grad-
ually in the course of educa-
tion would at least foster the
ability to cope with it when
the necessity for self-lead-
ership is presented with a
diploma.

IN THE REALM of the

academic, the University has
the highest of goals. It at-
tempts to produce citizens
who are responsible individ-
ualists, freed by their liber-
al education to formulate
their own decisions, to be of
inﬂuence in a society whose
purported aim is maximum
freedom of action, of
thought, of initiative and
responsibility. The experi-
ence of belonging to a cos-
mopolitan community of idea-
shapers should awaken in the
responsive student a desire
to become a creative part of
the larger adult world.

He is taught to recognize
the complexities and per-
plexities which comprise the
free adult community. He

_ discovers, with the existen-

tialists, the anguish of free-
dom, yet is simultaneously
made aware of his own crea-
tive potential for shaping
and directing his destiny.
The University does in-
deed direct its creativity to-
ward responsible leadership
in the community to which
it must answer. The students
which it turns out must
learn through their educa-
tion here, to confront the

glaring hot- dog, stands” on 

their own cornerg. .1; J

Hem pcl Discusses Induction  

By KEITHNEDELMAN

Carl Hempel, Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Prince-
ton University, posed several recent philosophical problems
concerned with the process of scientiﬁc induction at Wednes-
day night’s Philosophy of Science lecture.

Philosopher David Hume, in the 18th century, exposed

evening in Clapp Hall.

the most ancient problem in in-
duction; what is the justiﬁcation
for inferring from a number of
similar, known instances (A) the
character of some future instance,
or (B) a general statement about
that particular set of instances.

For example, if all crows en-
countered in the past are black,

have for supposing that the next

Although the administration
chairmen judged the Careers Con-
ference a disappointment in terms
of the number of people who at-
tended, they felt that it was a
success for those who did take
the time to visit the conference
Monday and Tuesday.

“Considering the work, time,

-and money spent on the confer-'

ence, I was disappointed at the
turnout,” explained Dr. Walter
Ritenour, director of the Univer-
sity Placement Service, “however,
many students did gain from the
conference.

“I question whether we can
evaluate the conference in terms
of the number of people who
showed up,” Dr. Ritenour con-
tinued. “If only a half a dozen
benefit from it, it was worth-
while.”

224 Plus Attended

Two hundred twenty-four stu-
dents ﬁlled out the registration
slips for the conference, but
many came to the conference
without ﬁlling out these s1ips,_ ac-
cording to Dr. Ritenour.

Many students who attended
gave very favorable reports on
the conference, explained Mrs.

or (B) what justiﬁcation does
one have for the statement “all

Problems

Professor Hempel stated that
the recently revealed problems
are logically prior to the problem
of justiﬁcation, in the sense that
the problem of justiﬁcation can
not even be clearly stated before

Attendance Proves Disappointing

Francis Holland, assistant dean
of women, and co-chairman of
the conference. “These students
also are doing a lot of creative
thinking. They are giving many
constructive suggestions for im-
proving the program. i

“Some students felt that by‘

having the conference in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom and Supper
Room instead of the Marble
Lounge and the corridor, there
was an air of privacy about the
conference and they felt they
shouldn’t go in,” she continued.
Hopes to Solve Problem
Student Union Board intends
to solve this problem by placing
some emblem, perhaps a Pan-
ther, in front of the Ballroom
when there is an all-Universi
event taking place. as
Other students felt that per-
haps the Chancellor should
have been the speaker at the

Hempel contended that rules
of inductive inference should
be expected to appraise evi-
vidence—statements and hypo-
theses rather than to provide
mechanical method of discov-
ery and proof. The status of
the inductive rules would then
be analogous to the rules for
deductive inference.

The following cases, according
to Hempel, are the paradoxes
which result from contemporary
conceptions of the nature of
sound inductive inference:

1) In the present day theory
an inductive inference is support-
ed by all of its negative in-
-stances, i.e. a red cherry supports

TOMORROW NIGHT’S football game with the Miami Hur-

ricanes won’t be an easy one, despite the Hurricane’s 0-3
record. The Hurricanes have a strong defense. Head
coach Charlie Tate, a student of Georgia Tech’s Bobby
Dodd, likes to playdefensive football.

He knows his team won’t score a lot of points
so he has to try to contain the opposition. Last week
the Hurricanes stopped a talented California Golden
Bear offense, led by all-America candidate Craig
Morton, limiting them to only nine points. The Hur-
ricanes were still outscored, however, 9-7.

The Hurricanes are reportedly weakest at the
tackles. This weakness could be an advantage to Pan-
ther tackles like Dennis Bernick and Jim Jones, who
still need more experience before the Panthers begin
the “conference” play next Saturday with Navy.

LOOK FOR the Panthers to run against the Miami line

before they try to pass. If they can move well against
the Miami line, the game could be a repeat of the
West Virginia game, with perhaps less scoring chanc-
es for the Panthers. -

The Miami pass defense, weak at the start of
the season, is much stronger now, according to scout
Joe Pullekines. The Hurricanes have a full-blooded
Seminole Indian, Andy Sixkiller in their defensive
backfield who watches flankers like his great grand-
father watched troop movements.

The football game won’t be a runaway, but the
Panthers could win it. Miami has scored only seven
points in its first three games. Their quarterback,
Bob Biletnikoff, is a strong shifty runner, but a
weak passer. The Panthers should contain him."

WE’LL HAVE to go with the stronger Panthers in this
game. Try 20-8.
at . at . all It . V
COACH JIM BANNER has done a great job with his
cross-country team. Last year the team was 3-4. Now
they sport a 4-0 record with just two meets to go.
Banner deserves credit for his team’s ﬁne perform-
ance. No one can ask more from an interim coach
than a perfect record.
Banner has raised the cross-country team from
mediocrity to excellence. We hope the Athletic De-
partment recognizes this. Banner deserves more

than just a. pat on the back for the job he has done.
Maybe he would like a raise.

Although the freshman soccer team lost to the West

are now 1-2.

The Fairmont State game will
be at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, Octo-

precede the varsity game with
Maryland University.

they’re a lot like West Virginia,

from the scouting report I re-

which they lost 9-7. I think if
they would have had their ﬁrst

gone all the way, however, both
men were injured.”

Miami coach Charlie Tate is a
strict disciplinarian and so far
17 men have been suspended
from the Miami squad. He also
stresses defense and the loss of
17 men from any team could
hurt both the offensive and de-
fensive team.

“They don’t have any really out-
standing players on their squad
although their defense plays ex-
ceedingly well together as a
team. I couldn't pick out one key
to their team.”

The Hurricanes are 0-3 with-
out the great pass combination of
George Mira and Nick Spinelli.
The offensive team now rests its
hope behind Bob Biletnikoff, a
sophomore southpaw who runs
better than he can pass. His inex-
perience has been hurting the
Miami offense for its success is
his ability to move them.

e No Revenge iMoti<ve
For Sam Donatelli

By BILL CABIN

When.you get spiked in the back, you usually want revenge.
Sam Donatelli doesn’t. In the 1962 Howard game, Donatelli was
jumped by .a player from the Howard bench, and carried a scar on
his back for two weeks.

“I fouled the man I was watching,” said Donatelli. “Then he
kicked me and I took a swing at him. Before I
knew what happened, a Howard player had jump-
ed off the bench and spiked me, and I was being
carried off the field.”

Donatelli, who lives in East Liberty, was one
of six Panther booters injured during the game.
Coach Leo Bernis dropped Howard from his sched-
ule in 1963 because of their rough tactics, but the
booters will play the Bisons this Saturday in Wash-
ington, D. C.

Donatelli “I won't be playing for revenge on Satur-

— , day.” said Donatelli. “All of the players who played against me
have graduated, and I have no reason to start trouble with any-
body. Besides, we’ve got to win this game to stay in contention for
the NCAA playoffs, and my revenge won't help us win.

“I’ve gained valuable experience since then. Although I still play
an aggressive game, I’m also more relaxed when I play."

In 1962, Donatelli was the starting inside right on the soccer
team that went to the NCAA quarter-ﬁnals. This year he has alter-
nated with sophomores Vince Bartalotta and Sal Tavares at the in-
side positioins.

" “It’s hard to take not starting, when you are used to start-
ing.” said Donatelli. “But I know I’ve got the skills, and I’m still
looking for a starting role.”

Because of academic difficulties, Donatelli started the season
three weeks later than the rest of the squad, putting him .at a dis-
advantage. “When Donatelli was declared eligible,” said Bemis, “we
had already been practicing with a starting team. He has had to

 

»‘catch up on his conditioning and adjust to the new boys on the

team.”

Donatelli is 5’6” and 140 pounds, making him the smallest man
on the team. “My shortness only hinders me when I go for a head
ball,” he said, “but it doesn’t put me at a disadvantage in dribbling
the ball or shooting.”

Over Howard Tomorrow

The soccer team needs a win
over Howard University tomor-
row in Washington, D. C., to gain
key points towards their antici-
pated placement in the NCAA
playoffs. The booters carry a 3-1
record into the Howard game
along with their hopes of being
ranked in the playoffs for the
second time in three years.

“If we can beat Howard,” said
coach Leo Bemis, “we’ll cover
our loss to West Chester, since
they are a common opponent. Be-
sides, beating a team with a
ranking like Howard will give us
valuable points.” Howard lost to
West Chester 1-0 in a double
overtime.

Although Pitt is in the Penn-
sylvania - New Jersey - Delaware
District and Howard is in the
Southern Conference, the Bisons
had an A rating on the Saylor
Point System last year, and were
in the NCAA playoffs.

The Saylor Point System de-
termines which three district
teams get placed in the play-
offs. At the end of the year,
the district NCAA committee,
headed by Mel Lorbach of
West Chester, tallies the total
points for each team in the
district.

This rating is done by first
ranking each team on .a parti-
cular team's schedule on the basis
of the percentage of games they’ve
won. A team with a percentage
of .750 or higher gets an “A”
rating, one with .500-.749 per-
centage gets a “B” rating, .250-

.499 warrants a “C” rating, and
any percentage below that is a
“D” rating.

After the teams on a schedule
are rated, the team whose sched-
ule is being considered gets a
certain amount of points for win-
ning or losing to a team of a cer-
tain rating. For instances, there
is a standard amount of points
alloted for beating or losing to
an A, B, or C team. The three
teams in the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey - Delaware District with
the highest points_ get berths in
the NCAA layoffs.

“I’m hoping we’ll have a con-
ditioning edge on them,” said
Bemis. “It’ still early in the
season, and the Howard play-
ers are all foreign and rarely ‘
get adjusted till the end of the
season.

Howard’s 2'7 man squad is dom-
inated by sophomores and jun-
iors with only one senior. Key
men in the Bison attack are jun-
ior halfback and captain Leon
Hunter and goalies Titus Oper-
aoacha and Cosmo Williams.
