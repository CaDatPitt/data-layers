DR. BRASHEAR
ADDRESSES
STUDENTS

Describes Five Hundredth An-
niversary of Founding of
St. Andrews University

 

Dr. Brashear, the “Grand Old Man”
of Pittsburgh, addressed the students
at the weekly convocation last
Wednesday morn_ing. If applause and
after comment among the students
count for anything, Dr Brashear made
the “hit” of the season so far this year
as regards chapel speeches. ,

In his own impressive way he
brought out the essential points of his
last Visit to Europe—-when he went as
the representative of the University
of Pittsburgh to the ﬁve hundredth
anniversary of the founding‘ of St. An-
drews University.

Dr. Brashear said in part: “The
trip over was a very ‘pleasant one, the
captain of the boat being a real good
fell'ow, and having the ability to ap-

ivpreciate American jokes I gave’ him
all I could think of.

I tried to make
my -diet conform to that of Mark
Twain’s shipboard diet, viz., “eat only

“St. Andrews is not such a really
great institution, but rather holds a
prominent place in the world’s great
institutions because of its age. I‘ As I
passed down those great halls of St.
Andrews I must confess I felt a triﬂe

all the great men were men worth

This is the story of the game in a

beat ’em to it every time and we literally
“got their goat,” although actually their
hoodoo escaped with them to Washing--
ton, where Billy will probably “Ba-a—a”

Forbes Field was again covered with-

inches of mud and water, but even these
conditions didlnot seem to detract from
the immense enthusiasm of the monster
crowd that attended the game. Many
“queens” were there with hugh gold
chrysanthemums and there seemed to be
an equal number dressed in the Red and
Black of the .Vl/ashingtonians. The left
wing of the ﬁeld held the W. & J. ad-
herents and band while the right wing
was ﬁlled with Pitt supp.orters. ‘Long

Pitt certainly earned the victory, for.

There was something doing in the
way of a variety celebration of W. &
J.’s defeat at the hands of Pitt by the
students on Monday morning.
lieve me, there were two interesting
hours spent by sev.eral_ hundred under‘-
graduates of Pitt between 10:30 and

was in three acts, each of which was

On Monday afternoon the ﬁrst

had» a day off in honor ‘of the victory

Mr. Connelly, publicity agent for
the *Grand, said after the perform-
ance: “It was the ﬁrst time we had
ever had such a gathering at our the-
ater, and I must confess we were sur-
prised and pleased with the conduct
of the Pitt men. Cheering is not per-
mitted at the theater on account of

of the Pitt ‘delegation to observe this

ENGINEERS  
BANQUET

ROYALLY  

Enthusiasm Reigns Supreme .’

 

at Gathering of Engineering ’
Faculty -and’ Students

 

One of the most enthusiastic gather-
ings ever ‘held by University students
was that of the Engineers banquet last
Saturday evening. From the moment
the students began to arrive.to the
grand ﬁnale there was not a dull mo-
ment. Faculty and dign-iﬁed alumni

alike forgot dignity and position and.

rooted and yelled till they had no
voice left. Never before in Thaw Hall
has there been such a grand time.

And the “grub” was just as ﬁne as -

the cheers were “gin.gery.” Turkey,
cranberry sauce, and all the
things which go to make up a Thanks-
giving dinner were there. As one man

put it, “the feed was as good as the A

game——and that is going some.” From

a live “Allegenee,” 1ed:by Cheerleaders  '

Richardson ’12, and Wagoner ’13,ito

the “We Want Grub" cry from a few"

unduly excited individuals at the-far

end of the hall, the cheers were kept.

going throughout the evening. All
the old songs, “Mary Ate,” etc., were
sung. Wagoner’s playing was heartily
applauded by the banqueters. ‘

Dr. Bishop introduced as. toast-
master VValtehour R‘ddle ’92.
Riddle opened the speeches wit'h -his
own thanks that after scoring two or
three touchdowns’ we had at last suc-
ceeded in having one counted. Among
the other speakers were Chancellor" S.
B. McCormick, Mr. Morris Knowles,
Dr} Carhart, Dr. Frost,- Messrs-.
O’Conner ’10, Richardson ’12, George

A letter was received by the E11-

the parade went down t'hrough Oak-
land, cleaning out the various “frat"
housesof any students found loitering
in them. Thence along Forbes street
to Pride’, cheering like mad and re-
moving signs from cars‘ when their
crews appegred not to be in sympathy
with the celebration. At Pride street
the parade turned up to the Dental
School; thence back to Forbes; thence
to Fifth avenue to the Court House.
Here the Dental students swelled the
ranks of celebraters to‘ over 500.i
After giving two or t'hree cheers

the order to “snake dance” down
Fifth avenue was given. Down the
hill “zig-zag” went the “rah! rah!

boys,” headed by Geo. Kirk and a
three—piece band (a drum and two
sticks). Thousands of persons, out for
lunch, stopped to watch the demon-
stration. Just when everything was
going nicely, that “crab” of an officer
a.t Fifth avenue. and Smithﬁeld street
came rushingnup to Kirk and said:
“In the name of t'he law, nix on this
rough stuff.” (Curtain.) ~

George had either forgotten ‘his per-
mit or in his excitement Saturday had

While some one
went after a permit the crowd decided
to give a few cheers. These yells
grated so on “His Majesty’s’’ nerves
that he yelled: “Disperse ye rebels!"
Then he attempted‘ a delayed rush

the line held and it was second down

Here the mounted
“suzbs” were called out and ﬁnally
pushed 'the crowd of students back
up the hill and made,them disband,
all the time being hooted by the spec-
tators, who were in sympathy with
the Pitt men. (Curtain)

ACT III.

“Revenge Is Sweet or Turning the

Tables on the Cop.”

After the dispersal of the parade,
about ﬁfty fellows stuck together, and
getting a permit, they marched right
back to Fifth avenue and Smithﬁeld
street, with Kirk at their head. “His
Majesty” winked" twice, rubbed his
eyes and blurted out: “What the ,
well I’ll be !”

“Here’s the permit,” said Kirk,'and
then the "‘Cop” had to step aside and

let Kirk, his drummer boy, _and fol-‘

lowers’ pass on unmolested.

Down Fifth avenue to Market street
went the parade, gathering Pitt men
here and there as they went; thence
along Liberty to Smithﬁeld; thence to
Fifth avenue, to have another look at
“His Majesty,;” then to the Grand
Opera House, where all the Pitt
cheers we're ‘ given three or four
times, while the noon-hour crowd
lined up on both sides of the street
to listen. (Curtain.)

The ﬁrst floor of the Grand was re-
served for the Pitt men at the after-
noon performance. L. G. B. '

sible to mold the different groups ‘of
,men andpwomen into one large ac-
tive body. _

In the past the men have shown a
disinclination to attend chapel regu-
larly. As a result many ﬁne addresses

 have been ‘delivered to rather small

audiences.. Owing to the institution
of the compulsory system, this’ con-

’ » dition will not ‘prevail "in the ‘future.

At the ﬁrst trial of the new system
the success of the undertaking was
amply demonstrated. The student

Men who in the past have refused to
attend chapel were ‘enthusiastic over

In the future we predict that the in-
stitution of compulsory attendance at

sidered a landmark in the growth of
the University of Pittsburgh.‘

THE ENGINEERING BANQUET.

The engineering banquet was one of
the best affairs of the kind ever giver
by the University. Dr. Bishop and
the members of the Student Senate
deserve great credit for their work in
arranging this banquet. It was a
great success. Every man who at-
tended it carried away with him a
feeling of loyalty to his school which
will never leave him. Such gatherings
as this draw the students together,
help them to become acquainted with
eac.h other and make them proud of
their University. They increase
spirit and promote good fellowship.

We trust that the other departments
will plan si-milar affairs to be held in
the _near future. They can certainly
proﬁt by the example of the engineers
in this respect. The senates -of the
other departments would have no diffi-
culty in holding equally as good and
enthusiastic banque/ts as was held by

the engineers last Saturday evening.

To the students we say, if your sen-
ate does not act, inform them of your
desire to hold such a dinner. The sen-

GENTLEMENLY STUDENITS.

We wish to congratulate the stu-
dents of the'University of Pittsburgh
upon their gentlemanly behavior dur-
ing last Monday’s celebration. Un~
like m'ost colleges and universities
not one -bit of rowdyism marred the
celebration. From beginning to end
it was conducted in a manner which
won the praise of all the spectators.

. When stopped by the police on ac-

count of the lack of a permit, the stu-
dents quietly‘dispersed un.til their per-
mit arrived, when they again formed
and proceeded down Fifth avenue. At
the ‘theater the same ‘gentlemanly be-
havior was very much in evidence.

We are proud of a student body
which ca-n and does conduct itself in
so praiseworthy a manner upon‘an
occasion which tends t'o make men
careless of regulations. The s,elf-con-
trol of our boys was one _of the best
advertisements the school could re-
ceive. People will see that our
school excels not only in curriculum
and college spirit, but -in the qualities
which mark the true gentleman..Noth-
ing the students can do will so thor-
oughly and so favorably impress the
people of Pittsburgh as such behavior
as marked the celebration last Mon-
day.

Editor Pitt Weekly: 1
Dear Sir :—-I understand there has
been an assessment levied -by the dif-

ferent classes to assist the Pitt Stu-

dent Band in securing uniforms. As
no one as yet has asked me for my
money, I have begun to believe that
no such assessment has been made.
It is the duty of the class treasurers
to collect this money. It is needed
immediately by the band. I would
like to ask whether the treasurers
think their position is a nice
honorary position with nothing at all

to do. We elected them with a dif-
ferent understanding. Unless they _
proceed to raise this money they

should resign and permit us to elect
some one who will collect it. The
band is suffering for lack of funds
while they sleep on their job. I trust
you will call attention to this matter
in the columns of The Pitt Weekly.
Yours sincerely,

“Attention to the Students.”

Editor of the “Pitt Weeklyc”

' Dear Sir :—During a recent chapel
gathering at the United Presbyterian
Church a little ‘incident occurred
which the students of the University
should make note of.

The chapel exercises’ were well un-
der way and all the seats occupied
when a member of the faculty made
his appearance in the balcony and,
after making a close search for a seat,
he met with a failure.
time‘ the balc'ony was well ﬁlled with
freshmen and probably some upper
classmen,‘ and not one attempted to
offer him their place, and he was
forced to stand during the exercises.

Supposing an outsider would have
made his appearance into that assem-
bly and the same thing would have
occurred; he certainly would have been
greatly surprised at the men in “Our
University."’ Is this the right kind
of spirit to display in the'University
of Pittsburg? Fellow students, let us

'guard against this in the future and

see ’that nothing of a similar kind
happens again. I merely offer this as
a precedent for all future meetings.
Sincerely yours, ‘
' AISENIOR.

When is Cap Night?
Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir :——-I believe it is about
time for this date t'o be published
around the University, as the Fresh-
men are already taking advantage of
the Sophomores’ negligence in forc-
ing them to wear their green caps.

Last year the Senate failed to set
a night for the -occasion and if the
upper classmen, or especially the
Sophomores, remember it caused a

great deal of hard feeling and an ex-

tension had to be granted the Fresh-
men owing to the upper classmens
forgetfulness. ._ ' . '

Let us be sure that nothing like
that will occur this. year because the

‘Freshmen are already wearing other

I saw over there at St. Andrews.
S'ome men had medals strung on them
from the size of a half dollar to a
good sized dinner plate. I don’t see
how some of them got around they
had so much stuff stuck on them.

“At a -dinner one evening during the
celebration there were 27 s-peeches to
be made and the ﬁrst man did not
speak until after 10 o’clock, and he
spoke for twenty-ﬁve minutes. I left
about 12 o’clock and the speeches
were not half'over, so you may sur-
mise what time they ﬁnished.

“At this same dinner a gentleman in
front of me drank four bottles of
champaigne and in an hour he was
to make a speech. I drank some
champaigne once and I talked all
night and all the next day; so. I had
reason to be worried as to the speech
he would make.-

tried to see how long they could talk,

“I think,” said Dr. Brashear in con-

clusion, “that the University of Pitts-
burgh made good at the celebration
at St. Andrews, and as far as being
treated well, I am sure I received
every kindness I could wish for. The
weather was ﬁne and I did not miss a
meeting. ‘All in all I had a ‘splendid
trip. '
"‘I think I have discovered one asset
in my various trips that not everyone
knows, namely, to make up with the
youngsters. If you can get on the
good side of the boys and girls you
are able by their influence to get a

life you would otherwise miss. I love
boys and" girls and always take time

Members of Band C
I Will Receive Letters

The newest acquisition to Pitt’s ath-
letic category will be awarded the ath-
letic letter according to Manager Don
Kirk. This hustling director has or-
dered 25 coat sweaters. of blue with
an old gold “P” on the left side. ‘The
letter differs from the ones awarded
the athletic in that a lyre is woven
in the steam of the “P,” which sig-
niﬁes that it was won by making a
musical team. The design was orig-
inated by James Thompson, a Pitts-
burgh High product who has recent-
ly entered Pitt. Thompson has par-
ticular ability in this line and the
sweaters will no doubt ma_ke a hit.

The purchase of ‘the coat sweaters
was made possible by the «donations
of several alumni, members of the
faculty and other Pitt well-wishers,
who believe the members of the band
shouldreceive some recompense for
their untiring efforts and enthusiasm.
The order was placed with Spau1d-
ing’s and the sweaters .have been
promised early next week, hence the
band will .be all “lit up” for the State
game. The emblem will be awarded
only, to those who “stuck,” and the
letter games will include all the games
and parades.

The attendance at Saturday’s game

was over 8,000.

Play Daqaesne

 

The Dean of the Pittsburgh Col-
lege of Pharmacy excused the Senior
class from laboratory work Wednes-
day, afternoon, Nov,em'ber'-15t’h, in
order that they might take part in, a.
game of football between the Juniors
and Seniors.

A large number of the Senior class
was there with their voices tuned.
But only six or eight of the Juniors
madeiitheir appearance at Forbes Feld.

However, a good game was ar-
ranged with the ﬁrst team of Du-
quesne University called at'3:30. It
was certainly an interesting one, espe-
cially for the spectators,‘ as the ﬁeld
was well soaked with water and at
least four inches of mud. The fellows
-played a good game and deserve
credit for holding"the fast and husky
Duquesne boys the way they did.

The game ended with a tie score of
6-6. Lineup: I

FOOTBALL ﬂora
The local ihterscholastic football
talent in the past few years has been
particularly good, as many of the col-
legiate players “pre-ped” in Pittsburgh.
Joseph Duff, a Shadyside graduate of
’08, is playing a star game at guard
for Princeton. Jas. D. Bebout, Pitts-
burgh High ’l0, is doing well at the
same position at Penn State. Earl E.
Gass, ’08, and Jim Munns, ’l0, Pitts-

Cornell. “Dod” Page, who entered
Penn'State from his junior year at
Pittsburgh High, is putting up an ex-
cellent game. Scully, of Yale, is also
a local player, but did not prep in
this city. Many of the Pitt team are
products of local High and Prepara-
tory Schools. ‘

The ‘greatest worry of the

 & J.-PITT NIGHT AT NIXON

 

Last Saturday night was W. & J.-
Pitt night at the Nixon theater. Both
schools were represented by large
numbers of students and the comple-
tion of the rival rooters was keen
and exciting. . W. & J.’s goat and
Pitt’s cheering of the team were the
special features of the night. .

Roo'rERs’ _MEETING.

 

Last Friday, N'ovember 17, a large
mass meeting of rooters was ‘held at
Forbes Field. School was suspended
at 3 :30 and all the students assembled
at the ﬁeld, New songs were re-
hearsed and yells were given like
never before. That old- song “For
months and months and -months” was
made to ring. An Alma Mater of fair
excellence was tried, but for an Alma
Mater song it does not express the
feeling consistent with the old Uni-
versity. Afterothe songs and cheers
the players were given three times
three. Among those coaching were
Doc Van Doren, Budd and other
alumni who had come back ‘to give
their assistance in preparing for the
W.’ & J. game. i » , - _

Coach Thompson spoke ‘to the
rooters andpredicted the game to
come out as it did, “With a fair mar--
gin for Pitt.” With thisthought on
their minds the assembly broke up
