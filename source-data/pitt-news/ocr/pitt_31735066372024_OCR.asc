The problem with the nuclear
disarmament today is that “the
arms race has taken on a new
language, a language aimed at
people's best concerns,” peace
activist Molly Rush said yester-
day in a lecture at the William
Pitt Union.

’ About 40 listeners sat at round
tables in front of the building’s
porch and munched watermelon
served by the Pitt Program
Council while Rush spoke about
the proposed strategic defensive
system, often dubbed “Star
Wars.”

Rush cited a recent unpub-
lished article circulated among
right-wing military officials
which suggested that “Star Wars
be promoted as a new way to get
topeace.” . .

She brieﬂy explained the Star
Wars defense: “In the event of a
Soviet strike, with thousands
and thousands of missiles going
up, our strategic defense wea-
pons would pick off the missiles
as they went up.”

To be successful, the system
would require “incredible accu-
racy and __billions of computer
transactions within seconds,”
Rush said. Scientists who have
studied the possibility believe the
system would be only 90 percent
effective ~ in other words,
hundreds of Soviet missiles
would still get through. “And we
don’t have to explain to people
what would happen with
hundreds of missiles coming
toward the United States,” she
said. '

The “Star Wars” defense pro-
gram would cost $30 billion over
the next five years for research

alone, said Rush, while the cost
of building and deploying the
equipment would run into the
trillions of dollars. “We’re talk-
ing about putting our whole
economy in hock.”

Public awareness is not. the
problem, Rush said. “Never has-
the American public been so
aware of the threat of nuclear
weapons.” She added that 80 to
90 percent of Americans polled
understand that nuclear war
would mean total destruction for
the planet.

But public apathy is a prob-
lem, she explained. “You have to
get outside the United States —-
and I suggest you don’t take my

-word on this — you have to talk

to people in other countries to
see how absolutely bewildered
they are that the American peo-
ple are swallowing all of this.”

Rush recently visited Norway"
and England, where she said
women were almost afraid to
bring up the subject of President
Reagan because they believe
Americans are indifferent to the
subject of nuclear weapons. The
women were “astonished” to
hear that thousands of grassroot
groups in the United States are
working for nuclear disarma-
ment, she said.

Rush said she agrees that
Americans may be slow to act
because of an it-can’t-happen-to-
us mentality. “The memory of
World War ll is very alive and
very real" in Europe, she said. “I

. sat down for an hour with a

woman who talked to me about
the nonviolent resistance move-
ment” during that war, a move-
ment Americans know almost
nothing about. “Even in Nor-
way, that movement is not cele-
brated the way it should be.”

Board approves final plan,

sets course for next 5 years

By Dirk Kaufman
Editor-in-chief

The final recommendations for
the university policy of the next five
years have been approved by the
board of trustees. President Wesley
Posvar presented the plan to the
board yesterday, and it received
unanimous approval.

In his proposal to the board, Pos-
var said that “as resources limit
choices, then choices must be for
more programs that can excel,
nationally and internationally.”

He prevﬂiewedt the plan saying,
“The whole university is to get ‘bet-
ter’ and, as we note in a number of
segments, ‘smaller and better.’ ” He
pointed out among his observations
about the planning process that
some of the early, tentative propos-
als for more far-reaching changes
and reductions have been modified
or dropped.

Among those proposals that have
been modified is the highly contro-
versial proposal to discontinue the
School of Pharmacy. In his final
recommendation, the School of
Pharmacy will merge with the

School of Health Related
Professions. _

The university will also begin an
undergraduate honors college. The
college will be built upon the exist-
ing honors program, and according
to Posvar, “will challenge the best
students to explore the excitement
of learning and achievement to the
limits of their capabilities.”

The cause of Affirmative Action
will be given a great deal more con-
sideration in all facets of the univer-
sity, according to the plan. In the
new program, the university will
give special attention to increasing
the number of tenured blacks and
women on the facultysand in aca-
demic and administrative leader-
ship. The plan also calls for
increased university involvement in
the early school years of black child-
ren “to encourage them to aspire to
higher education, including the most
demanding post-graduate and
career specialties.”

The plan will also include recruit-
ment of substantial numbers of
black freshmen and follow-through
efforts to ensure their successful re-
tention and graduation. Finally, a
community advisory board Will be

established to assist in the Affirma-
tive Action process.

One of the areas that will receive a
reduction is the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs.
According to the plan, the school
will be restructured and resources
will be concentrated on three main
areas of study: public management
and policy, urban and regional stu-

dies and international affairs. As a .

result of the restructuring, the size of
the faculty will be reduced approxi-
mately 25 percent and research will
be emphasized.

The School of Education is also
facingra reduction. According to the
plan, the school will be restructured
into three major academic areas.
These will be: instruction and learn-
ing, administration and policy stu-
dies, and psychology in education.
According to the plan, this will
result in a 25-percent smaller, high-
quality institution.

Posvar concluded his presenta-
tion to the board saying, “The prime
function ofa university is to preserve
human civilization, and what makes
civilization vital is a ceaseless drive
to discover, to reconceptualize, to

Pittassists Brazilian school
as part of community exchange

By Nancy Quick
Staff Writer

The Federal University of Maran-
hao in Brazil has approached the
University of Pittsburgh through a
non-profit volunteer organization
called the Partners of the Americas
seeking help in adjusting to the rapid
development of Maranhao.

Provost Roger Benjamin, in

- response to the request, traveled to

Sao Luis, the capital of Maranhao,
with Dr. Burkhart Holzner, director
of the University Center of Interna-
tional Studies, and Dr. James Mal-
loy, chairman of the department of
political science. The Partners of the
Americas sponsored the meeting
between the two universities.

“The Partners of the Americas

links regions in the United States
with regions in South America,” Dr.
Holzner explained. “The goal is to
promote understanding among peo-
ple through direct community-to-
community exchanges.”
V Federal University of Maranhao
Rector Jose Maria Cabral traveled
to Pitt several months ago to meet
with university officials before their
scheduled trip to his country.

“The Federal University of
Maranhao is particularly interested
in establishing an exchange relation-
ship with an American university
because, as a university in an under-
developed region, it accepts the spe-
cial responsibility of guiding the
development of Maranhao,"
Holzner said.

The University of Pittsburgh was
chosen because of its excellent Latin
American studies program, and it
has agreed to assist the Brazilian
university in improving develop-
mental methodology.

“Sao Luis is a l7th-centiiry city in
the backwater of Brazil," Holzner
said, “the picture of a Portugese city
as it existed in colonial times. The
community is suffering with major
problems in’ health and housing,

which are in need ofeducational and
developmental improvements.”

The recent discovery of large min-
eral deposits in northeast Brazil and
the subsequent construction of a
railroad connecting these deposits
with the deep water port of Sao Luis
have forced this traditional com-
munity to adapt quite suddenly to
modernity. According to Holzner,
the city’s condition will provide Pitt
with a fascinating opportunity to
strengthen its Brazilian studies pro-
gram, as well as providing scientists
and sociologists with important
research material.

understanding and cooperation, not-

just between the two universities but
between the two communities
themselves.

Barbara Perkovic, director of the
Pittsburgh and Allegheny County
Cultural Alliance, and Dr. Harvey,
Slater, head of the burn unit at West
Penn Hospital, also traveled to
Brazil.

“Pitt's efforts to collaborate with
the Federal University of Maranhao
will be coordinated with voluntary
community efforts in the final
_exchange program,” Holzner said.

“The community is suffering with major
health and housing problems, and is in need
of educational and developmental

improvements. ”

— Dr. Burkhart Holzner

Professor Malloy, chairman of
the department of political science at
Pitt, said the opportunity for an
exchange with Brazil will give his

department many possibilities for

research. One particular study
headed by Malloy is entitled
“Redemocratization of South
America,” focusing on a pheno-
menon affecting many countries in
South America, including Brazil,
that are emerging from authoritar-
ianism.

“The problems that Brazil works
with promise to provide us with
important research opportunities,”
Malloy said. “Our faculty will be
able to have first-hand experience
studying the country as well as
receiving the chance to go into colla-
borative research with Brazilian
scholars."

The Partners of the Americas
Organization has sponsored the
exchange program between Pitts-
burgh and Sao Luis to promote

 

“Community committees will be SCI.
up here and in Brazil to encourage
volunteer efforts from all areas.”

For example, Holzner added that
medical officials in Maranhao are
very interested in building a burn
unit for their patients. As the head of
West Penn’s burn unit, Dr. Slater
traveled to Brazil to consult with
them.

Both Holzner and Malloy stressed
the advantage, that University of
Pittsburgh students will have as a
result of Brazilian exchange.

“This, in addition to our other
exchange programs, is adding a new
international dimension to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh," Malloy said.
“Our students will have the oppor-
tunity to take part in programs that
build human, rather than political,
connections between nations. We, in
turn, will be able to provide students
with the opportunity to attend not
just a provincial university but one

‘that can open them to the world.” .

Shakespeare festival thrives
in city as one of nation 5 largest

By Leslie M. Bennett
Staff Writer

Three hundred sixty-nine years
after the burial of English litera-
ture’s chief icon in Stratford, Wil-
liam Shakespeare is alive and well
and living in Pittsburgh, Pa.

Now in its sixth season, the Three
Rivers Shak_espeare Festival has
gained the reputation of not only
attracting some of the finest actors
and actresses in the country, but also
of becoming one ofthe nation’s larg-
est summer festivals of the sort. Add
that to any place-rating formula,
and Pittsburgh should remain in the
good standing spot for a long time to
come. -

However, no catalog can com-
ment on a theater-going community
like the actors themselves. This
year's festival company appears to
have something good to say.

Monique Morgan, who has major
roles in all three of this year's pro-
ductions of Romeo and Juliet,
Twelfth Night and Measure for
Measure, feels that the main thing
that the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival has going for it is its
location. I

“There are lots of cultural events
going on here,” she said, “and it’s
close to New York —- which makes it
more accessible to actors and critics
from both directions. Morgan, who
is originally from Kansas and who
recently worked with the Clarence
Brown Repertory Theatre in Ten-
nessee, is back in Pittsburgh for her
second year with the festival.

David A. Baker takes a_ more
pragmatic approach to being in
Pittsburgh for the first time. “I'm
here because they offered me ajob,”
he said, “and they pay well.” Baker,
who had heard good things about
the festival from a previous director,
was cast in the lead role of Romeo
and Juliet as well as minor roles in
other productions.

“Another part of the attraction is
Pitt,” said Mark Easton Gruber, an
MFA student in Pitt’s theatre arts
department and company member
who will play Feste in Twelfth
Night. “And Attilio Favorini,” he
added.

Other members of the company
agree that producing director
“Buck" Favorini is the inspiration

and driving force behind bringing
Shakespeare to Pittsburgh. In 1980,
he founded TRSF as a project ofthe
theatre arts department of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Though the
university continues to provide
major support and facilities for the
festival, it is through Favorini‘s dili-
gent efforts that the project was able
to survive for the past six years.

Claude-Albert Saucier, appearing
through the courtesy of the Actor’s
Equity Association along with
Monique Morgan and five other
company members, considers Favo-
rini’s accomplishments to be a
dream realized during what he calls
the “worst possible time" to be in the
theater business.

“Sixty percent of all the theaters
in the country were folding —- even
Folger almost closed,” he said. “We
have to assume that Favorini has the
energy, the willpower and the power
of argument in bringing such a pro-
ject to success.”

This year, with W. Stephen Cole-
man serving as the interim produc-
ing director while Favorini is on
sabbatical leave, the measure of the
success can be described in any
number of ways. TRSF’s box office
sales and total operating budget of
$387,000 qualify it as one of the five
largest Shakespeare festivals in the
nation. Since I980, festival subscrip-
tions have doubled and still continue
to grow — this year the number has
already passed 2,500 and is expected
to reach 3,000. Support from the
general public and from corporate
and foundation donors has tripled in
the last three years alone. There are
over 30 local corporate and founda-
tion contributors listed in the I985
program. The company itselfis large
— there are 27 members and a total
of 80 staff and company members.
Shakespeare himself only had a
company of about 15 to 20
members.

Most importantly, however, is the
fact that these productions, which
receive popular and critical acclaim,
are reaching newer and broader
audiences through special perform-
ances for high school students, the
handicapped, family matinees and
the Shakespeare in the Park produc-
tion on Flagstaff Hill in Schenley
Park. -

As company member and local
Pittsburgh Don Wadsworth said. “I

think we’re doing good plays as
well.”

According to Saucier, one of the
fortunate aspects that go into these
quality productions is the Stephen
Foster Memorial Theatre

“It’s perfect," he exclaimed , de-
scribing the structure (which seats
600 cozily) as “a neogothic birthday
cake! And the tech staff has to be
commended. They just don’t quit.”

Morgan added that this years
Company appreciates each other
very much, which she says has so
much to do with how they work and
perform together: “Sometimes you
have star actors rather than ensem-
ble actors, and you get a lot less
done. There’s nobody like that in
this company.” '

A happy company is a crucial ele-
ment to consider when faced with 72
performances of three different
plays over a period of less than three
months, and most members have
roles in all three productions. This
group certainly appears to be having
fun amidst the hectic schedule. The
challenge of preparing for two new
characters while performing another
leaves no time for boredom.

As long as Pittsburgh continues to
provide sophisticated productions,
audiences here will become more
sophisticated as well.

“We’re sort of lucky heirs to this
yuppie generation who are no longer
afraid of going to the ballet or to see
a Shakespeare play — and who have
a greater inclination to go again,”
Saucier said. “But only as long as we
keep putting out quality produc-
tions. There are too many demands
on our entertainment money.”

The actors seem to enjoy working
in regional theaters such as Pitts-
burgh, where there is a mesh
between the community and the
stage. People here look for actors
they’ve seen before and pay atten-
tion to how they perform.

“I think audiences here are very
direct and very honest,” said Wads-
worth. “It's a healthy atmosphere.”
Baker is also impressed with how
quiet the audiences are and how well
they respond.

Gone are the days when Pitts-
burgh might have been considered
an industfial shot and a beer town
where theater didn’t have a home.
Shakespeare seems to have taken up
permanent summer residence here.

Media and science rendered
by experts as clashing forces

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Good science is bad show busi-
ness, but the differences between the
media and the growing field ‘of
developmental and social science
can be reached through cooperation
and compromise.

This was the message voiced by
nearly all the lojournalists, psychol-
ogists a-nd academes that met over
the weekend at the William‘ Pitt
Union for the Conference on Child
Development and the Media as they
discussed the complex relationship
of the press with the scientists.

At the two-day meeting, which
was organized by co-directors Carl
Johnson, Ph.D. and associate pro-
fessor of psvchology, and child care,
and Mark Strauss, Ph.D., an asso-
ciate professor of psychology, many
of the problems that the media and
child development professionals
have when working together were
discussed and some solutions were
offered.

“There is a definite tension
between the press and the scientists,”
said Robert McCall, a developmen-
tal psychologist and science writer at
Boystown. “And the problem will
not be alleviated until both sides
learn to understand each other.”

Many of the differences between
the two groups occur due to misun-
derstandings rather than any direct
fault or negligency by either party.
ln fact, said McCall, 95 percent ofall
scientists who have articles written
about them say they are generally
accurate. ‘ '

Part of the problem lies in the way
that the groups perceive one
another. Journalists see scientists as
being ignorant or indecisive simply
because they cannot properly
explain their ﬁndings. “Scientists
often use a style of language called
bafflegab - so named because no

one can understand it but other
scientists,” said McCall. “This, of
course. becomes troublesome when
addressing the public.”

Conversely, scientists and aca-
demes perceive journalists as seek-
ing information only for profits
sake. “The scientist has always been
the pursuer of truth,” said McCall.
“And they think journalists are out
to sell truth for the best price.”

Perhaps the biggest problem of
the relationship, however, stems

‘ from the scientists’ misunderstand-

ing of the news.

“Scientists lack a nose for news,”
said McCall. “They don't under-
stand the concepts of recency, con-
troversy and public interest — all of
which are crucial to the news and
found lacking in science. Thus
science is rarely news."

Misconceptions are only part of
the problem. Scientists and the
media also clash because the scien-
tists feel their issues are not given
enough time or are brushed over
superficially. V .

“The problem is more pro-
nounced in the broadcast media
than in the print media because of
the small amount oftime allotted for
each segment,” said Roger Klein, an
educational psychologist and re-
porter at WPXl-TV. “There is also
the need for the human angle, and
that reduces time for the explana-
tion on issues even further.”

Much of the blame falls on the
nature ofthe media itself and not on

~ the individual journalist, according

to Klein. He said that there is only so
much a newspaper can print or a
television station can run.
“Commercial broadcasting is very
competitive, and the purpose. is not
to make good programs but to get
good ratings,” said Arthur Green-
wals, producer of children's pro-
grams at KDKA-TV. “Technical
talk makes for bad ratings -—- thus
good science is bad show business.”

However, some believe that there
are ways to alleviate this problem,
and most of them revolve around the
cooperation of the media and social
scientists.

“Journalists and scientists don’t
have to be adversaries, but they
approach each other as though they
are," said Ellen Frank, a clinical psy-
chologist and reporter at WTAE-
TV. “There are ways to get around
the difference if we are sensitive to
each other’s needs.

“Journalists can allow scientists
to stick to the truth and help shape
[the material] in a way that is
usable."

Another problem is that the field
of child development is relatively
new and complex. It involves many
variables and always changes
through time — so much that a
recent finding will be outdated in a
few years.

“Reporters aren’t experts in the
field and don‘t pursue social
science,” said Carol Weiss, a special-
ist in human development at Har-
vard University. “Most of the
information they get is from the
social sciences  We should take
more responsibility in helping
reporters.”

The community of social scien-
tists, Weiss related, shouldn’t have
to rely entirely on the news media
and instead should go to magazines
that have more time or space to print
lengthy or complicated stories.

“We should cultivate the channels
of communication with the media,”
said Weiss. “But we shouldn’t be
totally dependent on them either.”

“This is an exciting time in the

J business,” McCall said..“Finally the

media has come to realize that social
and behavioral sciences are what the
people want to see — the only issue
is whether the job will be done well
or poorly and that won’t be decided
until the need for understanding is
reached.”

department.

Beginning as an outgrowth of the
feminist movement, women’s stu-
dies is a field which examines his-
tory, anthropology, sociology,
biology and literature from a female
perspective. Founded in 1972 as one
of the first in the country, Pitt’s
women's studies department, as with
the few others in the United States, is
new and still struggling to gain legiti-
macy in the academic world.

According to the director of the

program, Dr. Irene Frieze, Pitt’s
research associate program in
women’s studies will help expand
the department by bringing into the
program scholars who the depart-

ment would not have the money to

hire otherwise.

Also, according to Frieze, the
associate program is aimed at pro-
fessionals with doctorate ‘degrees
but without jobs. - .

“A lot of people with doctorate
degrees come to Pittsburgh for fam-
ily reasons,” said Frieze. “Then they
find themselves without a real job.”
ln this case, women are most often
the victim, according to Frieze.

“Unfortunately, it happens to

women more often than men.

because women tend to follow their
husbands.” For this reason,
women’s studies programs continue
to sponsor this program more often
than any other university depart-
ments. Pitt’s associate program will
be modeled after the other existing
programs around the country.

Pitt resecirch seeks cure fo

By Lisa Podrat
Staff Writer

Alzheimer's disease is a mind-
crippling illness that slowly destroys
the brain cells of the middle-aged
and elderly. Presently there is no
cure, but a team of Pitt researchers
have taken the first steps in ﬁnding
one.

Alzheimer’s can strike a person at
any age, but early symptoms usually
begin around the mid-40s. Patients
with Alzheimer’s progressively lose
their memory and reasoning ability
and eventually are unable to per-
form some of life’s simplest tasks.
Pouring a morning cup of coffee,
pressing the buttons on a microwave
or performing any of the daily tasks
that a normal healthy person takes
for granted suddenly become frus-
trating and unfamiliar to the Alzhei-
mer’s patient.

The team of researchers — Dr. I.

Hanin from the University of Pitts-'

burgh School of Medicine, Dr.
Donald Abraham from the School
of Pharmacy and other colleagues
— have developed a chemical com-
pound that, when injected into a rat,
will mimic the neurochemistry of an
Alzheimer's patient. The chemical
actually decreases acetylcholine lev-
els in the animals, causing them to
exhibit the same memory learning
and chemical deficits as that of an
Alzheimer's patient. Once the mech-
_anism of how the compound.actu-
ally destroys acetylcholine nerve

terminals in the brain is determined,
drugs can be developed to prevent
this destruction.

“This is what’s so exciting,
because with this animal model, we
can start to test drugs that could
possibly be useful in reversing the
deficit,” said Hanin. “These drugs
could be tried in the clinic — so
that’s what we feel is important.”

In addition to the animal model
studies, a study called the Alzhei-
mer’s Disease and Related Demen-
tias Project is taking place at Pitt.
This study examines all aspects of an
Alzheimer’s patient —— his behavior,
chemistry and neurology. In this
way, the disease can be studied com-
pletely. Hanin said it is important
that the brains of those with Alzhei-
mer’s be analyzed in an autopsy
because the brain is where the
answers lie.

Sometimes Alzheimer's can be
confused with other neurological
disorders. “There are many other
diseases that look like Alzheimer’s in
the living patient, only to find in
post-mortem analysis that in fact it
was not Alzheimer’s,” Hanin said.

Many patients have consented to
donate their brains to the
researchers to further investigate the
disease. If someone with Alzhei-
mer’s should die, three people who
are on-call 24 hours a day are trained
to prepared the brain for an autopsy
and analysis. To insure an accurate
and efficient brain autopsy, a “brain
autopsy kit" has been developed by

those in the project. Every person V

possesses »a kit that consists of a
small styrofoam container equipped
with all the materials needed to con-
duct the brain dissection.

“In comparison with other groups
in the country, the longest time that
we have ever had to wait from the
time that a patient has died to the
time that a patient‘s brain has been
dissected and prepared for analysis
has been only from four to six
hours,” said Hanin. “Other groups
sometimes wait anywhere from I2 to
24 hours after death before they get
to the brain. By then all kinds of
chemical changes can occur, and in
our case, we can get to it by four to
six hours.-"

“Those participating in the study

‘are at least 45 years of age and have

been experiencing some type of
mental loss, confusion or dementia,”
explained Nancy Keefe, project
coordinator. “The patients are mon-
itored throughout the progression of
their illness for any changes that
occur. Complete physical exams and
neurological testing are done."

“However,” Keefe pointed out,
“in the early stages of the disease, an
Alzheimer’s patient will be able to
handle himself very well socially,
appear to be physically fine and
exhibit no signs. of Alzheimer’s.
When tested neuropsychologically,
they may be unable to do a simple
addition problem.” The patients are
also tested for their blood choline
level in thehope that the informa-
tion can be used as a biological
of Alzheimer’s.

r Alzheimers

marker for the disease.

The study also offers a support
group based on need for the friends
and families of the victims of Alzhei-
mer’s. When the disease strikes, it
not only affects the patients but can
be quite consuming for family
members as well. It is usually the
immediate family who assumes the
responsibility of caring for the
patient until the burden becomes too
great. As a last resort, sometimes the
safest thing for a family to do‘is to
put the patient in a nursing home.

Caring for an Alzheimer’s patient
can be frustrating for both parties.
Those with the disease often act in
childish, bizarre and even violent
ways. Unless the family is well-
counseled on how to handle these
situations, it could be life-
threatening to the patient and fam-
ily. To help eliminate these
problems, family members are
taught to shy patients away from
activities that they can no longer
perform and gear them toward
activities that they are still capable
of doing.

What the program is ultimately
trying to do during this three-year
study, according to Hanin, is to find
patients in the early stages of the
disease — patients with minor
memory losses in case there’s any
chance that it might be the beginning

pate in the project or would like

I’ve been a Buc fan my whole life,
so it bothered me when Joe L.
Brown said, “There is an attitude
problem. Pittsburgh doesn’t like the
Pirates.” Everybody from Myron
Cope to Tom McMillan has theories
about why Pittsburghers don’t care
about baseball. But I think the
experts are the people with the atti-
tude problem! I think they’ll agree
that none ofthese experts are typical
fans. None ofthe old-time fans I talk
to worry about “Oh, the Pirates are
all blacks and hispanics," or “Pitts-
burgh is a football city.” We real
Pirate fans just like to have a good
time at the park. I’ve been to seven
games this year, and none of my
friends that go complain about the
players: They are not the problem.

But dozens of old fans I talk to all
tell me they used to go to 30 or 40
games a year at Forbes Field and
they never go now. The Pirates are
not so far from beinga good team —
they have good pitching and fielding
the piece that is missing is the hit-
ting, and that can come with a little
enthusiasm and fan support, as Pete
Rose has showed. I believe the prob-
lem is, clearly, that people do not
want to go over to Three Rivers Sta-
dium for these night baseball games.

There are about 70 home baseball
games, and seven or eight home
football games. And for all the
annoyance and risk and discomfort

   

  
 

Opinions

the Pirates

involved in planning to go to Three
Rivers, it’s worth it to go see a base-
ball game. ‘I was talking to Myron
about this on his show Monday, and
he just couldn’t see that.
Pittsburgh is not a “football city,”
but Myron is a “football sportscas-
ter." He is used to seeing the football
games sold out, but it‘s entirely dif-
ferent with Pirate games. Steeler
fans know a year in advance when
the eight home games are. They
know it will be a safe Sunday morn-
ing-and they plan their tail-gaters
and make a day of it. But you can’t
make a day of it at the Pirate games.
Baseball games should be easy to
hop over to on the spur of the
moment, but this is not likely to
happen as long as they play the
games over in that barren, derelict
area around Three Rivers Stadium.
All this has cost the Pirates and
the stadium any new fans (and most
of the old fans) since the move in
l97l. If going to the ball game is
always a chore and you always have
to plan for a safe ride (and I don’t
mean on a bus), new fans can never
see what an easy good time hopping
over to a ball game in a place like
Oakland should be and you never
develop the next generation of fans.
But Myron and the experts can‘t
understand that. They think it has

something to do with steelworkers 
and blue-collar stuff and

psychology. A

Wouldn't it be great if the games
were back in Oakland? With a little
cooperation from the field hockey
team and intermurals, the Pirates
could play at Pitt Stadium like the
Steelers used to do. Pitt Stadium
could be easily modified to fit a
major league diamond, and there
would be good crowds every night,
because people like to go to Oakland
anyway. The fans would be back; we
know this would be true. But this
idea is out of the ordinary, and the
experts so far won’t even think
about it. They shoot it right down
with poorly thought—out arguments
and falsehoods like the parking
stories.

Unfortunately, the people who
make the decisions are not the ones
who really love baseball. Look at the
Cubs. The Cubs have kept their fans
all these years, but they never once
won the World Series. They play at
Wrigley during the day only, and
still the fans always go see them. The
Cubs take care of their fans.

Brown and the experts are dead
wrong. It’s not that Pittsburgh
doesn’t like the Pirates, Pittsburgh
doesn’t like the way the organization
treats it at the games. That coldness
is killing the game here, in the same
way the KDKA and Joe L. Brown
wiped out Bob Prince’s life as a
broadcaster and ran him up a pole.

Dear Editor

Some people think we need to
have a welfare state so we can have
programs like student aid. A little
reflection, however, will prove the
opposite: if we didn't have a welfare
state, we wouldn’t need student aid
programs. (“National student group
battles Reagan's proposed budget
cuts," The Pitt News, June I2, I985).

First, if our government didn’t
subsidize the defense of western
Europe and Japan (both have suffi-

Oakland

There were only 4800 fans at
Thursday nights game but there
were ISOOO. fans on Sunday
afternoon.

That tells me the fans are there but
they are just not willing to come to
the “North Side Wasteland” at night
for a simple baseball game. People
will go to Three Rivers for an after-
noon weekend game, so let’s con-
sider playing in Oakland during the
week, and the North Side on wee-
kends, or in case ofconﬂicts, like the
Steelers used to.

I know the city has several
hundred million of dollars planned
for development around the sta-
dium. An amusement parkjust can't
change the problem; let’s move the
ball games back to a living, bustling
neighborhood. Then the real Pirate
fans would be back.

cient GNP’s to finance their own
defense), or stifle economic growth
through regulations and control of
the money supply, or waste its time
and our money on pyramid schemes
like Social Security, taxes would be
loarenough that either you or your
parents could save money for your
education and receive at least five
and one-fourth percent interest on

-it. Instead, many have to borrow
their tuition money at a minimum of
eight percent interest. Clearly, stu-
dent loans don’t help students as
much as they help banks.

Second, Iet’s not forget the con-
nection between student aid and tui-
tion hikes. As the law of supply and
demand teaches, making more
money available for a given com-
modity drives its price up. Apply this
law to growing numbers of people
who don’t belong in college but who
go anyway (thanks to financial aid),
and it’s no wonder tuition goes up
every year, and sometimes much fas-
ter than the general inﬂation rate.
(And you probably thought it was
President Posvar’s fault!)

Finally, let us prove we have
indeed learned something here at
Pitt. Let’s have a little skepticism
towards those who would rather see
us become victims of the welfare
state’s legal theft (“taxpayers," as
someone in the article called them)
instead of free and wealthy individu-
als in a libertarian, laissez-faire capi-
talist economy.

Evelyn  Waug'n  
Revisited

When the Going Was Good and
A Little Learning

Evelyn Waugh

Little, Brown and Company

England has a great tradition
of satirists and wits. Perhaps it is
the nation’s unique vantage
point that provides its people
with their peculiar sense of
humor; perhaps it is something
inherent in the British character.
Jonathan Swift, Ronald Fir-
bank and Monty Python have all
hailed from that small country
and have given the world some
of its truest, most biting and
hilarious social commentary.
But the prince of all English sati-
rists (“king” would be too osten-
tatious) must surely be Evelyn
Waugh.

Between 1927 — when his first
novel,_ Decline and Fall, was
published - and his death in

V1966, Waugh was a prolific,

driven writer. The pervading
theme of all of his writing was
the decay —- economic, social
and moral —— of civilization dur-
ing the 20th century. His stand-
point was Christian: A Catholic
convert, he lashed out at the dec-
adence and corruption that he
saw around him with the most
effective tool that he knew —
humor-. One need not be
Catholic nor particularly

I appalled by modern society to
laugh at his writing. Even at his

most moralistic, Waugh was
roaringly funny.

Little, Brown and Company
has recently re-issued in soft-
cover two books that shed a
great deal of light on the mind of
this great humorist.

. When the Going Was Good is
a condensed compilation of four
of Waugh’s travel books. ln the
1920s and 1930s, few writers
made enough money from royal-
tiesto live well, and one very
good means for them to escape
poverty was to travel and write
non-fiction books about what
they experienced.

Waugh’s travel tastes ran to
the remote and desolate.
Between 1929 and 1935, hejour-
ne_yed Irom England to Abyssin-
ia (what is now Ethiopia), Zan-
zibar, the Congo, the Middle
East and the Brazilian jungle.
His accounts.of these adventures
are written with the same ironic
wit that fills his novels. Ofa brief
sojourn in Paris, he writes:

We went to a cafe called Le
Fetiche, where the waitresses
wore dinner jackets and asked
the ladies in the party to dance. I
was interested to see the ﬁne,
manly girl in charge of the cloak-
room very deftly stealing a silk
scarf from an elderly German.

Later, en route to 'Addis
Ababa, Waugh recalls “that on
his ship:

 There were about 20 of us

of my cabin. Tin trunk after tin
trunk was dragged out with mil-
itary commands from the ser-
geant in charge and loud
unmilitary remonstances from
his subordinates. It seemed
hardly conceivable that five men
could have so many clothes 
Their contents had been the
object of wild speculation
among the passengers, our imag-
inations wallowing in a profu-
sion of Biblical opulence —
frankincense, sardonyx,
madrepore and porphyry. In
point of fact, as appeared later,
they contained a handsome but
unexceptional suite of bedroom
furniture.

A Little Learning, written in
1964 shortly before Waugh’s
death, is the first volume of an
autobiography that he never fin-
ished. It is written with candor,
warmth and an effortless grace
of language of which Waugh was
master. '

Drawn largely from many
diaries that he kept at various
stages of his young life, A Little
Learning shows Waugh with an
astonishing capacity to look

 

back on his own experience with
objective detachment. There is,
however, just a hint of nostalgia

as he describes Francis Crease, .

an “amateur scribe” and early
mentor:

He spoke, I found, in soft
tones which in moments of
amusement rose shrilly. Today
he would be described as an
obvious homosexual. I believe
he was entirely without sexual
interests.

He writes that his unusual
name came about from a whim
of his mother’s:

I have never liked the name
[Evelyn]. In America it is used
only of girls and from time to
time even in England it has
caused confusion as to my sex.
Once during the Italian-
Abyssinian War I went to a mil-
itary post many milesfrom any
white woman, preceded by a sig-
nal apprising them of the arrival
of “Evelyn Waugh, English wri-
ter.” The entire small corps of
officers, shaven and polished,

June 19, l_98_

turned out to greet me each bear-
ing a bouquet. I was discon-
certed; they were overcome by
consternation.

Either of these books can
serve as a I good primer for
Waugh, but the real core of writ-
ing was his novels. Twelve of his
major works have also been re-

issued, from Vile Bodies and Al

Handful of Dust to The Loved
One andhis controversial mas-
terpiece, Brideshead Revisited.
Any or all of them are a worth-
while investment.

Waugh lived and died in rela-
tive obscurity, having enjoyed
only a brief period of fame with
Brideshead and The Loved One.
His irascible nature kept the crit-

ics at a distance, and only

recently has the literary com-
munity begun to acknowledge
him as one of the great writers of
this century. It is hoped that the
reprinting of these books may
spark a new interest in Evelyn
Waugh.

Byrne and his Heads dance to a different beat

q_Tal|<ing Heads:

The fun continues

LITTLE CREATURES
Talking Heads
Sire Records

Considering the eclectic direc-
tions into which Talking Heads

"(both as a band and as solo

artists) have musically delved,
nothing they release — short of
raga or hardcore punk — could
really be called a departure. And
yet, on Little Creatures, the
band ‘s eighth and certainly least

V exotic offering, David Byrne and

company seem to be doing some-
thing dramatically different. The
success of the film Stop Making
Sense may be the origin of this

3 change-of-heart.

While Byrne has managed to
evade the stuffy artiness tacked
onto his musically lauded con-
temporaries — Brian Eno,
Robert Fripp, Philip Glass,
David Van Tiegham -— he has
never, in his nine years as a pop
performer, really escaped the
stigma of being a Greenwich Vil-
lage weirdo.

Until Stop Making Sense. The
quirky and often complex
sounds of Talking Heads are a
mite less threatening when they
are presented by a charismatic
lunatic in a big suit. Live, Byrne’s
incongruous humor reduces the

\ mysticism of studio Talking

Heads to its basic form. With
Byrne as interpreter for the
seemingly difficult music, Talk-
ing Heads drop their guard, so to
speak. Little Creatures is one

step farther than Stop Making V

Sense in the vein of accessibility.

Though occasionally stilted
and self-conscious about their
stripped-down sound Little
Creature shows the Heads in an
attempt to recapture the simplic-
ity and spontaneity oftheir earli-
est releases. For the most part,
the album’s musical scope differs
little from that of More Songs
About Buildings and Food, their
second lp. Of course, seven years
of musical maturity renders
duplication impossible, but sev-
eral songs, namely “And She
Was” and “Stay Up Late,” are
strikingly reminiscent of More
Songs.

Still, the feel of Little Crea-
tures is completely fresh. Avoid-
ing the gratuitous veil of
intelligence that permeated pre-
vious releases, Byrne eases off
the pomp and allows his stage
persona a hand in the lyrics. The
results are charming.

In the title track, with a con-
trived country feel played so
deadpan it transcends parody,
Byrne, with a ridiculous drawl,

sional jazz band from New
Orleans called the Dirty Dozen
Band. Although some of the
music recalls the mournful-to-
boisterous processional stylings
of American gospel and New
Orleans-style funeral marches,
there is an abovious detachment
of emotional content that makes
these David Byrne-isms more
akin to the structures and sensi-
bilities of performance art and
minimalist composers like
Laurie Anderson and Phillip
Glass, respectively.

Music for “The Knee Plays "is
music that takes itself seriously,
but the recording often makes

the normal feel weird and is
injected with comic twists and

turns of Byrne’s phrases. The’

odd, seriocomic effects created
by Byrne’s prose against a back-
drop of chamber-like orchestra-
tion make this album, well,
interesting.

Some things work extremely
well on this record, as “The
Sound of Business,” “Tree
(Today is a Very Important
Occasion)” and “In The Future”
attest. “In The Future” contains
all the characteristic quirky
qualities inherent in Byrne’s art
and is recognizable throughout

monologues that present little
observational stories of people,

and outright criticism. But ever-

presentation, so that the listener
is confused by the situations
Byrne poses but entertained by
the prospect of this uncommit-

offers easily the most disarming
line in the history of rock ’n’roll:
Well, I've seen sex, and I think
it's all right. (You have to
wonder, had this been said 20
years earlier, would we have had
to endure the priapic rantings of

glam-rock?)
The fun continues. In “Stay
Up Late,” Byrne innocently

yearns, in the same absurd stiff-
ness of the lyrics’ punctuation, to

play with an infant past its bed-“

time. Cute. Cute. Little baby.
Little pee pee. Little toes ..
Don’t you wanna make him.
Stay up late. And we ’re having
fun. With no money. From
there, the track wends its way
into an R&B groove -— in which
Byrne lifts a line or two from
“Ain’t Too Proud to Beg,”
authenticating the feel — before
it plods its way back into the
chorus. -

But while Little Creatures is a
definite return-to-the-roots Ip, it
would be an injustice and an
untruth to label this album as a
carbon copy of More Songs
About Buildings and Food.
There’s so much more to Little
Creatures. Though it lacks the
musical coherence of previous
albums and fails to flush out the
great song —- there’s no “Once in

a Lifetime” or “Burning Down -' ‘

the House,” but “Road to
Nowhere,” “The Lady Don’t
Mind” and “And She Was” are
all stable hit material - Little
Creatures is strong Talking
Heads, probably the most invit-
ing they’ve ever been.

David Byrne’s trademark
psycho-killer howls, so intrinsic
to early lps, though few and far
between on Little Creatures,
glare with pretense — and for a
very good reason. In their latest
incarnation, Talking Heads, for
the first time in their undeniably
substantial career, sound like
they’re having fun.

Sport talk

Opener moved
up to August 31

The University of Pittsburgh "and
Purdue have agreed to move up the
date of their I985 football opener
which was originally scheduled as an
afternoon game on September 7, but
the date was changed to August 31 at
7:45 p.m. to accommodate ESPN’s
intentions of televising the game.

The change will bring the first

‘night football game to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and Pitt Stadium.
Although the stadium is not
equipped with lights, temporary
lighting can, and will be brought in
for the game. .

The switch leaves Pitt with a two
week layoff following the Purdue
game, a rest they just might need.
The second game of the season will
take the Panthers to Columbus,
Ohio on September 14 for a bout
with Heisman Trophy candidate
Keith Byars and the Ohio State
Buckeyes.

The only major effect that the
mpve will have on the players them-
selves will be an earlier beginning of
camp. The Panthers, who annually
invade Edinboro for fall drills, will
report three to five days earlier than
what was originally anticipated -
August 15.

The school itself will realize more
of a difference from the move,

 

 

----Sports

though, especially in its bank
account. Pitt will receive approxi-
mately $262,500 from,‘ESPN for the
free television exposure. Purdue will
receive the same amount.

More importantly, an impressive
performance by the Panthers
against Purdue before this national
audience could vault the Panthers
high in the rankings. But, more real-
istically, another game like last years
opener against Brigham Young on
ESPN, and it could be last year all
over again.

Davis quits WVU
hoop team

West Virginia University basket-
ball coach Gale Catlett has reported
that guard Andrae Davis has left
school for academic reasons. Davis,
a 6-5 sophomore from College Park,
Ga., has reportedly contacted
Auburn University about the possi-
bility of transfering to the South-
eastern Conference school. .

Davis, who averaged 6.5 points
per game last season, was suspended
by Catlett twice last year during the
season for disciplinary reasons.

In other Atlantic 10 news, the con-
ference announced that it is doing
away with the three-point field goal
for next season.

Lewis signs 11 for
women's track
team

Pitt women’s track coach Steve
Lewis, hired only one month ago,
has already begun the rebuilding
process of a track program that was
virtually reduced to nothing by pre-
vious coach Elbert Kennedy. Lewis
has signed ll recruits to join the
three remaining runners left over
from the Kennedy team.

Heading the list of athletes is Han-
nah Russell, a distance specialist
from Mt. Lebanon High School.
Russell holds school records in the
400-, 800- and I600-meter distances,
as well as in the high jump. Her
trophy case holds over 10 WPIAL
track medals in addition to three
cross-country championships.

Joining Russell are a pair of All-
Americas from Newport News, VA.,
Donna Collins and Tracy Toon.
Collins, from Denby High School,
was the Virginia indoors champion
in the 55-meter hurdles, the same
event in which she earned All-
America honors. Toon is from
Menchville High School, the same
school where Lewis coached before
coming to Pitt. Toon’s forte is
sprinting, but she also gained honors
in the discus.

Also committed to Pitt are Gloria

Help or hinder?

Pitt officials question effects of poor sports climate

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

For the past 10 years the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh has ﬁelded out-
standing football teams with
exciting players such as Hugh
Green, Tony Dorsett and Dan
Marino. These players, now in the
NFL, have since helped to sell out
stadiums across the nation, even
though they could not do the same at
Pitt Stadium.

It would seem that with the possi-
bility of the city of Pittsburgh’ losing
three of its professional sports
teams, officials at Pitt are going to
sleep at night with visions of turn-
stiles clicking in their heads. With
the departure of the Pirates, Pen-
guins and Spirit, it would seem logi-
cal forthe University of Pittsburgh
to pick up a bigger piece of the enter-
tainment pie of dollars to benefit

S "their attendance problems.

However, this is not so according
to sports information director Jim
O’Brien: “I don’t believe that we
would benefit from it at all. “I think
it would be a setback to everybody.

“The problem that afflicts the
Pirates, Penguins and Spirit also
hurts Pitt. That problem is that right
now we do not have a healthy sports
climate in this city, and people are
not attending sports events — with
the exception of the Pittsburgh
Steelers — the way that you would
hope they would.”

Pitt is in a unique situation as far
as big time college sports are con-
cerned. It is one of few institutions
located in a major metropolitan
community that has been able to

.“We’re not like vul-

tures sitting on a fence
hoping that those
teams will go out of
business. We have to be
rooting for these peo-
ple to succeed.”

—— Jim 0’Brien

maintain a major college sports’
program.

In the early l970s the image of
Pittsburgh was enhanced by the
Pirates‘ World Series appearances
and the Steeler’s Super Bowl victo-
ries. It soon became known nation-
ally,as an excellent sports town.
O’Brien feels that the image is bene-
ficial to recruiting athletes to Pitt,
and the deterioration of that image
could make Pitt less attractive.

“Some athletes find it appealing
to go away to a country school with
a grassy campus,” he said. “But
we’re living in a city that has a good
sports image nationally. Our ath-
letes find it a very appealing situa-
tion to come to a city where they can
view major league sports. Our play-
ers become familiar with the profes-
sional athletes, and they’ve gotten to
know guys like Bill Madlock and
Willie Stargell.”

Since Pitt basketball competes
directly with the Penguins and

Spirit, basketball promotions direc-
tor Kimball Smithifeels that their
departure would mean a change in
winter sports in Pittsburgh: “I think
it’s logical to assume that if they
were to leave town that the sporting
entertainment for Pittsburgh would
be college basketball, both Pitt and
Duquesne. I'm sure it would have an
effect on our attendance in a positive
way."

This does not mean, however, that
Pitt has the cake already ordered for
a going-away party. According to
O’Brien. “We’re not like vultures sit-
ting on a fence hoping that those
teams will go out of business. We
have to be rooting for these people
to succeed."

Two years ago it was corporate
involvement in
helped to bail out the Pirates. Now,
the DeBartolo family has made
demands on the people of Pitts-
burgh to help with their attendance
problems. In the end it looks as
though it will again be the corpora-
tions that will keep the Penguins and
Spirit here.

This is one area where O'Brien
feels Pitt has gotten the short end of
the stick. “All ofa sudden there is an
awakened corporate enthusiasm for
‘Hey, what can we do to keep
DeBartolo happy?’ ” he said. “All of
those problems that those teams
have, we have at Pitt, and we need
the same kind of corporate involve-
ment, where they realize that Pitt is a
part of the package, too.

“Some firms like Westinghouse
do that because they are recruiting
people to come and work there.
They feel that a strong sports team at
Pitt adds to the quality of life in
Pittsburgh.”
