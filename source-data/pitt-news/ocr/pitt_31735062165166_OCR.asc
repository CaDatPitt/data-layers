“because of the increasing num-

sion.” Last year’s class of in-
coming ‘freshmen was 21 per

cent larger than that in 1954

and 41 per cent larger than that

of 1953..This is just the crest of

the waves,” said Dr. Quick. “En-

rollment will be extremely large‘
in years to come.” '

‘He said there are 2-1/2 million
students in colleges today and by
1970 the estimate is 41/; million
students enrolled in
throughout the nation..Thus, be-
cause of the revised admissions
procedures, he said, Pitt must, and
will,_be more certain about the
students who really mean business
about coming to the University.”

approved by the undergraduate deans of the Uniyersity. Only

high school students considering application for "admission to
_the University as_full-time students will be affected by the

The main revisions in the admission procedure concern
the stepping up of the processing of applications for admis-
sion, a new reservation deposit of 50 dollars, and an earlier
deadline for admistration of entrance examinations.

“The quickening of the admission

procedure,” has

been undertaken. said Dr. Quick, 64

of applications for admission to
the spring semester.

Under the revised policy, n

entrance examination for fall se-

mester admission will be admin-

A reservation deposit of 50*
dollars will now be required of

Needs Being Met
_Chamber of Commerce repre-
sentative Nevin Schall, on the
negative side of the debate, claim-
ed that “there is every indication
"that we are meeting needs” now
inthe states. 2‘ ‘
Contrarily, ‘Martin maintained

 the idea that federal aid would

such ii‘ fear’ is unnecessary. ‘He

students fear “dual'taxation.”

The hour-and-a-half discussion
ran l5imihutes over time because
some of the more than 80,students
present began questioning the’
panelists on federal aid.

, Teachers Beneﬁt

When asked what kind of “con-
trol” would result from federal aid,
Nevin answered, the school con-
struction, sanitation and general
principlesaof the teachers.

Positive speaker Thomas at-
tacked Nevins’s statement as be-
ing untrue, referring to his claim
of Salk’s unbiasness even after
federal aid.

On giving some backgroundfor
federal aid in the past, moderator
Thomas questioned the ‘constitu-
tionality and extent of possible
constitutionality of national aid.
Dr. Martin, thereupon, stated that
this was not a relevant item to,
discuss as other federal aid had
been "sought ,a1ready , through the
United States Constitution’s pre-
amble and, further clauses of the
Constitution. _,

~ To alleviate the parking situa-
tion i-n Oakland somewhat, Betty
Watters, Pharm. ’58, recommended
that the ldt behind Clapp Hall be
used for parking by students _and
faculty members: Before the pur_
chase of the ‘Schenley Apartments,
the lot was to be the site of the
men’s domitories. The lot was used
temporarily as a parking area dur-
ing social functions held in or near

- the Cathedral. Any further use of‘

the lot at that time was objected
to because oftest-boring which

* was taking_ place for the planned

dorms.

Present use of the lot as a park-
ing ‘ area would be difﬁcu-lt to
initiate because of involved taxes
for such use of University prop-
erty and the necessity of student
admission cards to insure exclusive
Pitt use of the lot. I ‘

SC plans to ask University of-
ﬁcials about the possibility of fu-
ture use of the lot for parking.

that constitionality was not rele-
vant to the discussion. ’

Judge Brown and Nevin dis-
agreed on the original respons-
, ibility of aid to education. Nevin
said it now lies with local au-
thorities and should stay, there.
‘Judge Brown said responsibility
began with the_general assem-
bly’s responsibilities.

Thomas _stressed the fact that
the United States has aided edu-
cation since World War II. He
stated that $34,000,000,000 has been
set aside in the past'by the fed-
eral government for education.

Main ‘Problems Listed

, Having attended six weeks of
hearings in 1948 on Congress dis-
cussion ‘of education, Dr. Thomas
stated two main problems listed in
Congress: the desegregation move-‘
ment and the role of private and
parochial schools in support of

«CS0

education in" America. Although
private school opposition to fed-
eral aid was discussed at the Mon-
day meeting, desegregation was
not discussed.

Congressman Robert Corbett,
scheduled to participate in the
debate, was called to Washing-
ton by Vice President Nixon.
Mr. Nevin took the congress-
man’s place. »

Joe Monturo, president of Coun-
cil/of Scholastic Organizations, in-
troduced "the speakers and gave
credit to the Vp‘anel,iMen’s Debate
leader Robert Newman, and to the

 ‘Much A (In About Nutting   ,

W The recent announcement that Dr. Charles B. Nutting
will be leaving Pitt came as a surprise to most of the people
who have known him as one of the mainstays of University

administration; it came as a shock to those who are familiar -

with the manner in which Dr{"Nutting has been running the
.University as acting chancellor. Description such ‘as “ter-

"*riﬁc” or “wonderful”j' are the types of praise his colleagues

and faculty members have used to describe his position; _
‘ And it is an awkward job he has. As a liason between

H everything that is old and established and that which -is’

vigorously young and fast, Dr. Nutting must carry out ino-
vations in the absence of the chancellor, while seeing to it
that the University runs as it has in thepast.

If‘ 7 For students, the departure means the loss of a, close

hfriend, for the vice chancellor has done much within his
position and responsibility to meet their demands. Last year

‘ ' and in the past, he has met with student leaders in informal

l:jf‘9/ll-"‘discussion. His down-to-earth attitude in all the situations

-~

he has faced, his ‘ability to meet students on their level and,

 of course, faculty and administrative personnel on theirs,
 -marks an unusual personality. ’ '

Dr. Nutting is short of stature, but cuts a strong ﬁgure
, who’ has, in recent months, gained respect for the university
,g merely by his presence. He won many television viewers as

- well as sugar bowl officialsiin Ne'w‘Orleans by his clear, .

brief statements bristling with both as sense of humor and
dignity of an important cog in "an educational institution.
.In the football game race incident when his words were
briefienough to clarify Pitt’§ position without dignifying
that of Governor Griffin, he stood up as the leader. Even in

. rallies, he won the admiration of students by his realistic
attitude. ‘ ‘ , ' ‘

By Irv Raihman

Andre Gide, a contemporary
French critic of conventional
ethics and society’s principles
once expressed himself in the
following manner‘: “I write so
that an ado— '
lescent, simi
lar to the one ,
that I was at 3
sixteen years,‘
b u t“ ' f r e e r
hardier, more .
a c complished
ﬁnds here, in
later life, the
answer to his
throbbing in-
quiry.” But
Gide, reliable
sources report,

 

 

wasn’t‘ sure he
was answering the right ques-
tions. Hecontinued to present
the conditions of human nature_
in the hope that the reader could
realize’ the answers, himself.
From‘ Gide’s novel “Les Caves

Du Vatican”, Arthur Wilmurt,
a Carnegie Tech playwright in-
structor, adapted the character
of young “Lafcadio” and pre-
sented a play at Carnegie Tech
under that title. Lafcadio chose
to escape society’s laws and in
doing so found he had to “ac-
ceptthe bounds as well as the
risks of being free.”

Lafcadio Wluiki opines, “Free-
dom is impulse” and involves
himself, as ‘a result of his lack
of inhibition, in‘the .murder of
an innocent train rider whom he
has never seen before. To his
earlier question, “Can you be

' human without being free” Laf-

cadio gets his answer. For, to
be a.welcome human in society,
one must use restraint. But the
murderer is never brought to
punishment, because of‘the im-

possibility that one would com- 
mit such a crime with no rea-

son at all—even the. 7,000 lira

the statue ‘maker Amedee Fleur-’

issoire carried with him was
not taken. ’

Tech's 'Lafcadio' Reviewed . . .

‘Freedom Is Impulse’

Recognizes Brotherhood
Lafcadio who realizes that he
is the illegitimate son of the
well-heeled Count Juste—Agenor
de Baraglioul, receives a life-
time compensation upon the old
man’s death; and by chance in-
volves himself as a reader for
the old man’s legal‘ heir, Laf-
cadio’s much older brother, the
Viscount Julus
The Viscount, ambitious to enter
the French Academy, receives
the long-awaited acknowledg-
ment based on a paper express-
ingfthe idea that some persons
act impulsively and for no"re,a-
son at all. It is a statement he

later refutes for complicated
reasons and ultimately saves
Lafcadio. - ‘

The wayward son, who at-
tempts to free himself from the
bawdy habits of friend Carola
Venitequa and the vicious

swindler, Protos, who pretend a A

plot against the Pope, eventually
ﬁnds himself entangled in their
machinations to win a fortune
from Felurissoire - Blafaphas
st a t u a r y dealers. Ultimately
Baraglioul is involved, but when
Protos attempts to extort black
mail from him—Blackmail is a
high institution; many a repu-
tation has been saved by it -
matters take a turnabout, and he
lands in jail. —
Literature ta Swindle

Gide, with some fewchanges
Wilmurt, laughs at
cirtics and writers and human
nature which is afraid to admit
its truths. Lafcadio cries out to
writer'Baraglioul, to the eﬁect
that it is the “process of erasing

and changing thingsgthat makes‘

literature a “swindle.”Gide chides
the staid-at-home but unfaith-
ful, away aristocracy‘ of Paris,
1893 when he reveals the rea-
son for secrecy of Lafcadio’s

identity “Flaws in a noble house’.

Points of Interest '

Pitt followers picked up the
enthusiasm and carried it with

them as they toured “The Cres-

Among‘ other thingskthere was
the French l\/Iarket, the boat ride
on the .Mississippi, the jam ses-

-sions, ‘the alumni rally in the_

Roosevelt Hotel, the regetta, and
the game itself._ The spirit was
almost at a peak on New Year’s
Eve with the typical New Year’s
Eve picture of people crowding
in the streets with funny hats
and horns, the only difference be-
ing the sound of hot Dixieland
jazz instead of Auld Lang Syne.
There even were collegians there
from Auburn who had just lost
a Gator Bowl game to Vanderbilt
that day and were now in New
Orleans cheering for Skyscrap-

An odder incident yet was the
sight of a ‘car carrying West Vir-

I

Although the Orange are rated one 'of the loop’s weaker

teams, the locals rate no better than an even chance against

them. This year’s squad is only the¢
Panthers’ second varsity edition
A and is studded with sophomores.
Another reason for pessimism
 on the part of Coach Warren
Neiger is the fact that three of
his top. stars will not become
eligible until February—John
Hammond, Tom Darling and Joe
Lamartine. A .
Lamartine was one of the lead-
ing point makers on last season’s
H contingent and is sorely missed in
L-7 ¥the side-horse event. The other
two are only second semester
freshmen but .have already given
promise of being stars. ‘
Hammond looms as the best
tumbler while Darling, according
to Coach Neiger, has the best
f chance of any Panther t’o cop in-
dividual honors in all-league com-
-petition.‘ His best event is the ﬂy-
ing rings but he also will compete
: _ on the horizontal bar.
In addition to his notlheing
l able to use the latter two", Neig-
'er has also lost last year’s high-
'est scorer, Joe Ray. Although
only a. sophomore, ~ Ray was
.forced to drop out of school due
to family illness. '
. Despite all these handicaps, the
A vmatch still is considered a_tossup.

Owl Features Color Photographs

By CAROLYN STASENKO .
The «1956 Owl is celebrating its golden anniversary with

’ a burst of color. In contrast to last year’s publication,‘ which

concentrated its color photos in-the front of the book, this
year’s yearbook will feature color photos thrughout the en-

dent and administrative.

. Owl, opening the door to a wider

view of life at Pitt.

; Editor Joe Banik, Co1.”56, re-
ports that the theme, the 50th an-
niversary of the Owl, will be sup-
plemented by the sub—theme, Pitt
as seen through the eyes of the

V ,Ow1 during these last 50 years.

Birthday Celebrated
The ﬁrst Owl was published the
same year that Pitt moved from

Hits North Side site to the present
., location.

In keeping with both

birthday celebrations, therefore,

_  {the Owl will concentrate much of
’”f~_.the color photos on the University
itself both inside and out.

In addition, however, student,

 at Pitt has also been built

up. Banik says, “We’ve used

‘ umany color shots to effectively

bring out the human element.
After all, the students will re-
member the buildings, but it’s
7 their fellow, students they’re
really interested’ in.”
, Many of the ﬁne ideas in the
books of the past years’ will re-
main. They have/been changed
only in scope. Articles will be en-

 larged upon, with many being

built into features.  . V
Division Pages Colorful

The division pages alone offer
a tremendous. opportunity to pre-
sent color-photos of major activi-
ties of the year, such as a day at

Sweethearts Pose Informall

The Fraternity Sweetheart fea-
ture will no longer be merely a
straight pose of the girl, but a
series of photos of each girl, show-
ing her in various informal shots.

Naturally, one big feature of
the book will be the Sugar Bowl
game, says Editor Joe Banik.

Rather than merely run a story

on the game, though, the article

will bring in the students who
attended the game and how they
spent New Year’s Day in New

Qrleans. .

One other important ‘ﬁrst” for
the 1956 Owl is the use of its own
seal. This seal, along with the Uni-
versity seal, will be the motif used
throughout the“book. ~

Banik gives credit for the ﬁne
publication to his staff. “They’ve
done a terriﬁc job,” he says. “The

book is sure to be a sell-out.”

Fall Quarterly Ready

Since its ﬁrst publication in the Fall of l939, “Pitt,”'a
quarterly magazine published by the University Press, has
given students, teachers, alumni, administrators and trustees

tions. ~..-
The publication provides its
readers with the physical, intel-
lectual and spiritual phases of the
University, including such topics
as features written by faculty
members," facts about the various
Schools and their departments, and

it was proclaimed safe and effective. Now, March of g.‘ ‘

must still remember those, _born too soon to be protected
by the vaccine, who still need care and those tens of
thousands who will be stricken in polio epidemics before
the vaccine is made even more effective. ’ ’

Named as the head of a nation-
wide program to seek drug cures
for cancer was Dr. Harry F. Bisel,

assistant professor’ of medicine at
Pitt. _ p '

Dr. Biselwas appointed to the
job of temporary secretary of the
Clinical Studies Panel of the Can-
cer Chemotherapy National Com-
mittee. In his new position Dr.
Bisel will be in charge of study-
ing the effects of various drugs
on human cancer patients.

The cancer committee.was set
up by four government agencies
connected with cancer research
plus the American Cancer So-
Damon Runyon
Memorial Fund.

Dr. Bisel’s appointment was
made possible by the decision of
the Cancer Society to put their
recent $25,000 grant on a tem-
porary basis until the govern-

of a permanent research head.
.A “partial leave of absence”

was given to Dr. Bisel by Pitt so
that he can commute between
Pittsburgh ‘and the cancer—drug
headquarters in Bethesda, Md.
In addition to his recent ap-
pointment, Dr. Bisel is assistant
coordinator for the Pittsburgh
