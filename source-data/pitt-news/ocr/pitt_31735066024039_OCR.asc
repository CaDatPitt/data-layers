  Semester At  Provides Incentive
  To Question Provost's Power

By SCOTT STONE
Pitt News‘ Staff Writer

The Semester at -Sea’s need for
course approval has become a spr-
ingboard in the Faculty of Arts and
Science’s attempts to criticize
university policy on the provost’s
power to initiate new programs
without faculty consideration.

V “I think you could say there was
a general feeling of dissatisfaction _
with the way the program was-
brought here,” said Keith McDuf-
fie, dean of the Semester at Sea
Program. _

The FAS, at a meeting last Thurs-
day, decided to send back to the
Council of Arts and Sciences the
task " of review and approval" of
courses for the Semester at Sea pro-

a Monday, November 3, 1980;

of the merits of the program, the
FAS should have been consulted
first before it was actually inserted‘
into the FAS,” said Irwin
Schulman,- Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences. “I think there’_s
some room for argument; _it’s one
of those constitutional issues. I
think that if the provost, tomorrow,
wanted to open_ a_ campus in
Monroeville Mall, then that’s his
, perogative,” Schulman said.
Because of this feeling on the part
of the FAS, and for other reasons,
the question of course approval has
been moved back and forth bet-
ween the CAS and the FAS. Thurs-
day’s _decision is encouraging for
McDuffie, but it still leaves a
number of details unresolved._

gram.‘ The decision came after a
two-and-a-half hour deadlock, in
which some members wanted to
draft a mo_tion that would include
their disapproval of the methods
employed ‘by the university to‘
’ acquire the program.

The Semester at Sea was brough
to Pitt after negotiations last Spring
between Pitt’s Chancellor Wesley
Posvar and C.Y. Tung, owner of
the ship S.S. Universe, and after the
Institute of Shipboard Education
had decided that it was going to‘

' leave. its previous home at the
University of Colorado.

“Basically, I think the objections
that were raised were about pro-
cedure. There was some feeling on
the part of people that, regardless

and that could cause some pro-
blems,” McDuffie said.
I Other objections are concerned
with the program itself. They range
from political science professor
Richard Cottom’s reaction which,

The newly-opened bus lane on
Fifth Avenue was a subject of con-
cern at last Thursday’s Student
Government Board meeting.

“We have towork closer with the
administration to get something
done on Bigelow Boulevard that
will make. it safer for pedestrians
with the new bus routing in effect,”-
said Commuter
spokesman Glen Walsh.

The new bus lane, which opened
last Sunday, was designed for the 71
Port Authority Transit (PAT)

_routes. Recently, PAT decided to

use the lane to accomodate the.6l
routes also. This creates a problem
for pedestrians on Bigelow because
the 61 routes use the boulevard as a
throughw to Forbes Avenue en
route to Squirrel Hill.

“As I see it, there was a problem
crossing Bigelow before the lane

"opened and any additional

vehicular- traffic will just make it

’ worse,” Walsh said.

Last Monday, a Pitt student was

struck by a bus in thebus lane on
Fifth Avenue. '

“Regarding the accident that oc-
curred last Monday, itgis my opi-
nion that the main reason the acci-
dent happened was because of a
lack of sufficient publicity before
that lane opened,” Walsh said.

Walsh said he spoke with PAT’s
manager of rates and transfertabout
the problem of the buses using
Bigelow Boulevard.

“We had a lengthy discussion
and disagreed about whether there
would be a problem with that many
buses using Bigelow; his figures
show that 12 buses per hour will run
on Bigelow at rush hour and less
during midday, when most students’
cross,” Walsh said. '

“PAT says an order has been
issued to all drivers on the Bigelow.
routes. They will be restricted to 15
mile per hour and must have their
headlights on at all times,” Walsh
said. I ‘

Revised Procedure Document

By’COLLEEN McDONALD
H ‘ Pitt News Staff Writer

Strong support for the
simultaneous acceptance of two
revised university procedure
documents has been expressed by

the _Faculty Assembly. The Plan-

ning and Resources Management

‘System (PRMS) and Policies

Relating to Reorganization or Ter-
mination of Academic Programs
were under considerable discussion
at Thursday’s. meeting.

“PRMS is -purely a procedural
document,” said Professor William
Brown, president of the university
senate, “and the termination docu-
ment is a compliment to the pro-

Discussed At FAS Meeting

certainly our intent to get .both
documents through.”

The purpose of PRMS, according
to the document itself, “is to im-
prove the ability of the university’s
academic and administrative leaders
to make informed decisions.” Pro-
fessor Norman Mulgrave,- chairman
of the Senate Budget Policies Com-
mittee, said that it was indicated
one-and-a—half to two years ago

that there should be a senate review _

of PRMS. _
“The committee felt that any
program expansion must come.

‘from some contraction of another

program,” Mulgrave said.
All planning proposals will come

Academic credit availabl   ’

‘By ANN WALKER
Did you ever wish you could go
to the movies and get academic

' credit for it? How about “Carrie,”

Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy,

and Mel Brooks? Well, the Film »

Studies program at Pitt can provide
this unique opportunity—— without
box office lines!

But the fact of the matter is,

/besides being one of the most
popularforms of entertainment and
liesure, film is also a genuine art
form.

“Film is one of the most impor-
tant and vital art forms. The
average person has the most contact
with this medium and it helps in the
understanding of life,” according
to Lucy Fischer, director of Film
Studies program at Pitt.

The history of ﬁlm studies at Pitt
started in 1975, when the College of
Arts and Sciences Council approved
the establishment of the program.
The developers of the program in-

cluded a wide and varied selection

of academic pursuits: Bill Judson of
the Fine Arts dept.; Marcia Landy
of the English dept.; Bruce‘Golds-
tein, psychology dept.; and Walter
Alberts, French dept.

These Pitt faculty members
helped develop the curriculum and
coordinated the various film
courses into one program. In 1979,

, Fischer was hired to deal exclusively

with coordination of the program
and she was designated director of
program.

Then, in February of 1980. a

' CAS Council decision unanimously

approved a certificate -of film
studies, giving the expanding pro-
gram a solidarity the developers felt
was needed. Now, the 418 credit con-

~ centration in film is certified and is

‘‘Film is one of the most important and vital art forms,” Lucy

recorded on the student's
transcript. ’ ‘

Basically, Film Studies is an inter-
disciplinary program of an
undergraduate’s liberal arts cur-
riculum which studies the various
aspects of film: historically,
aesthetically and theoretically.

The study of film helps students
to realize the‘ impact the medium
has on society, according to

I Fischer.

“The program helps students to
see film within society; they learn to
appreciate films for their com-
plexity,” Fischer said.‘ —, ,

In addition, some of the careers
the program can provide students
for include: film teaching, film

library, film journalism, and
museum work. -

to another place, and this is why we
study the psychological reactions to‘
films.” Goldstein’s course,
“Psychology of Film,” deals with
the editing of a film by changing the
light, sound, editing or any process
in fihn making and seeing the effect
that it has. . ' .
“Films differ psychologically due.
to the way the film is put together:
light, sound, color and

fcinematograpl-1y,” Goldstein said.

Films studied from other depart-
ments include Hispanic, Fine Arts,
and Eastern Europe studies.

The program works in conjunc-
tion with the Pittsburgh Film-
Makers in Oakland. Marilyn Levin,
Executive Director of the Film-
Makers said that it is her organiza-
tion where students interested in
film studies receive the production
end of film making.

“We offer courses in cinema pro-
duction, photography, lighting,
sound, and script writing,” accor-
ding to Levin. The Film-Makers are

combine lecture and St11dlO work
and even entail courses which re-

Also the film section of Carnegie

There are three specific programs
available to students in film studies.
Students can take numerous elective
courses in film studies or they can
also enter the certificate program.
This is a concentration of 18 credits
which entails an introduction to
film studies allowing a student to
major in another area while receiv-
ing thorough work in film.

Finally, students may self design
a major in film studies, although
this is a more intensive study of film
than the certificate.

Film Studies at Pitt is constantly
expanding in a variety of ways. In

addition to receiving a budget for
the ‘purchase of films, the film
library at Hillman library is grow-
ing. Also a lecture series on film is
planned for later this winter.

The _Program sponsors certain
film showings. On November 16,
they will be showing a seven hour
German film, “Our Hitler”, co-
sponsored by Carnegie Institute.

“It is an examination of the Nazi

era, an epic extravaganza,” Fischeriff

said. It will be shown in the David
Lawrence auditorium, Part I at 2:00

’ and Part -II at 7:15. Tickets may be

purchased at the film section of
Carnegie Institute.

A Film- Studies Newsletter is be-
ing developed and any interested
student - wishing to receive the
newsletter should contact Lucy
Fischer, 624-6551. The newsletter
will list film events around the city,
lecturers, speakers, and screenings
of films. These projects are open to
the public and not exclusive to Film
Studies students.

. The popularity of Film Studies is
growing. Fischer reports that film
classes tend to fill up quickly. I

Film Directors such as Scorsese,

George Lucas, and Steven Speilberg I

are all graduates of film schools.
Their works include “Star Wars,”
“Empire Strikes Back” and “Close
Encounters of the Third Kind.”
These men first learned how films
were effected by history, studied

' film aesthetically and theoretically

before stepping into the production

» of films, and this is what can be

gained from Pitt through the Film
Studies program.

The Port Authority Transit has

changed seven routes that formerly .

operated via Forbes Avenue. These
new routes involve the 61A, 61B,
61C, 71B, 71C and 71D.

The‘61A, 61B -and 61C will travel
from downtown via Forbes Avenue
and turn left at Jumonville Street.
These buses will then travel towards
Fifth Avenue turning right at Fifth.
They will _continue ' traveling on
Fifth turning right at Bigelow
Boulevard. They will then travel

towards Forbes Avenue turning left '

at Forbes and continuing on their
regular routes.

The 71A, 71B, 71C and 71D will
follow the same route from
downtown as the 61A, 61B and
61C, but instead of turning right
onto Bigelow Boulevard, they will
continue traveling on Fifth turning
left. at Craig Street and then con-

PAT Explins Fifth Ave. Changes;
Urges Pedestrians To Use Caution’ —

should not interfere with pedestrian
traffic on Bigelow Boulevard since
there are more cars traveling this
route than buses at that particular
time.

Katis said that PAT officials urge
pedestrians to exercise caution
when walking along either curb lane
on Fifth Avenue and to look both
ways when crossing Fifth since the
new bus lane makes Fifth a two-way
street now. ‘Katis said that PAT
drivers have been instructed to
sound their horn if necessary when
traveling in the curb lane to warn .

' pedestrians.

According to Katis, the new
routes are on a trial basis, but will ’

soon become permanent routes,» ,

Katis said that the city has erected-
signs designating the new PAT

stops, and the bus lanes have been ;,

clearly marked. A map‘ showing the
new Oakland routing and boarding
points is available from PAT. Katis
said that because of the congestion
that formerly occurred on Forbes
Avenue, these new routes were
devised to eliminate that problem.

John Anderson and Ronald Reagan have, amaz-
ingly enough, found the one, single, specific reason

~ for all this country’s foreign and domestic woes:
. James Earl Carter, Jr. .

_ After listening to the campaign rhetoric of these
contenders, many voters could be led- to believe once
Carter is removed from office, inflation will drop,
unemployment wll cease, and the hostages will board
the next ﬂight home from Iran.

’ But what do they offer us as alternatives?
Obviously, a vote for Anderson is a vote for

Reagan. Anderson has no real power base, lost much,

of his allure when his see-saw record on the issues
was uncovered, and can only act as a spoiler in this
campaign.

Therefore, the choice narrows to Carter and

‘‘ Reagan.

Reagan offers simplistic answers to complicated
issues, and long term answers for immediate pro-

For example, Reagan's solution for inﬂation and
unemployment—lessening intervention in the private
sector. Reagen’s answer to the gas shortage and the
OPEC threat—long term production.

In addition, the merits of reagan’s proposals to
heat up the arms race, de-personalize the Middle East
negotiations, and return taxing responsibilities to
state and local governments are questionabale at
best.

Reagan has also undercut his credibility by‘ often

uttering clumsy, irresponsible statements, like his V

comments on Taiwan and Klu Klux Klan.

. Carter, although he boasts a less than perfect

record, can not in all fairness, be blamed for all this
country’s problems. - "

Carter's stand on human rights, his active position
in middle east negotiations, and his attempts to
achieve a realistic energy program outwiegh his occa-
sional ineptness and somewhat unfortunate family
ties. '

Carter has something Reagan and Anderson lack-
experience." And now, when America faces pressures

at-home and’ abroad, time. cannot be given fo the in-_

experienced to learn the lessons of the presidency.
Therefore, we choose Carter over Reagan and

Don’t Gripe  

To coin an old adage, “If you don’t vote, you
don’t gripe.” I

There are approximately llll millon registered
voters in America--accounting for 71 percent of the
eligible populaiton.

-According to the gallop poll, only 75 percent of
these registered voters will actually cast their votes on

These statistics indicate that only 53 percent of the 4

It is indeed sad to think tha_t only a little over one-
half of our nation cares enough to take five minutes
to vote. , , '

It is quick, simple and painless, and, what’s more,
it doesn't even cost anything. .

There are people in other nations who would die t
have the right to elect their governing officials, but,
here in the United States, it seems that the right to

    says Amett Misunderstands Defense Issue, r.v. stations‘

To the Editor:

/, Mr. Arnett’s attack on Channel
11 and Dave Kelly suffers not only
from what seems to be a lack of
any understanding about defense
issues in general, but also an
abysmal ignorance of how televi-

 “ /‘ sion stations must function. As one

.who paricipated in the “Controver-
sy!” show on Sunday, Oct. 26, per-
mit me a few comments:
» » —Television stations are under
 pressure to do a certain amount of
 ‘.‘public affairs” programming, for
‘  . which they receive no substantial
advertising "income. This does in-
.deed result in programs which are
not all that well produced, a pro-
blem exacerbated by the necessity to
deal” with significant topics in" a
limited time. ‘P
.—So far as I am aware, there is
no fixed “liberal” view about
defense issues, nor any fixed “con-
servative” position. Candidate
Reagan, described by one of the
participants in “Controversy!” as

' ' , the equivalent‘ of a mad bomber,- ~

  

 . opposes draft registration‘, ‘while
 » \ .Candidate Carter favors it. While
"C ' this is as important an issue as any,
neither position can easily be label-
 ed purely .“liberal” or “conser-
‘ * . — vative.” , . ‘
f - —“My \friend Joe .. Coffey. said
* [more than. once, -I think]_’ that the
._,..issuesv could -not I be ..add_ressed “in

 

  

,:,;..:-._,;,i_¢1;. ,§!‘1i]3:¢*ra]f!_‘ of. *

“conservative,” and my impression
was that the mix of opinion in the
audience was reasonably portrayed
by the range of voices raised during

the half-hour. To Arnett, Coffey,

may be a right-winger.
—Prior to the ‘taping of the pro-

gram, Dave Kelly read from a roster

of participants, asking each to state
in a sentence or two “where they
were coming from.” I stated them,
as I did in my one contribution dur-
ing the program, that in my opi-
nion, conventional wars were no
longer possible ‘on a large ,scale--
that we should all recognize that
any future war involving the U.S.
and U.S.S.R. would be all-out
nuclear sfrorn the beginning. I
presumed then, as I do now, that
when Kelly asked a Navy officer in
uniform to say something, the of-
ficer would support a “strong na-
tional defense,” and, that when he
asked people identified with church
organizations to speak, a strong
“peace” statement would follow.
'-—Arnett’s column is somewhat
mystifying, in that he spent a half-
page writing about the “liberal”
and_»“conservative” sides of the
defense issue without mentioning a
single item that could be identified

’ with one side of the other. Then
: again, Arnett obviously is -a very»
confused individual. While con-x _

servatives,” Arnett admits along
the way that it was simplistic and “a
clever rhetorical device” to present
the issues as having only two sides.
Arnett cannot-have it both ways.
But, then again, The Pitt News

reads these days as though it has,

received firm instructions as to
what it can write about. Since
university issues seem to be out-of-
bounds, the local T.V stations pre-
sent a handy target. . ‘

Election Coverage

To the Editor: \

Why weren't any of. Russell.

Rice's policy views on the front
page of Wednesday’s Pitt News?
When someone reads an article of
that type it is rare that they turn the

page to finish reading it. I believe ‘

this is a poor example of what
should be objective journalism.
Russell is a candidate with many

good intentions. It is a shame that.

none of his comments nor even his
name are not mentioned untilpage

five. We need a leader like him to i

stand up and represent the students.

‘I am going to give him my vote,

but I wish you ‘could give him fair‘
publicity by not burying his state-

ments where it is unlikely anyone _

will ‘read them.

Arnett replies:

Pr0fesS0r.._, Thayer is ‘confused
about the subject of the column. Its
wasa criticism of Channel Eleven
and Dave Kelly, not an explora-
tion of the issue of defenseispen-
ding. Having two years experience
in Pittsburgh —’s professional broad-
cast media, I’m well aware of
broadcaster’s public . affairs re-
quirements, which I ’ explained in
the column. . .,

Why Thayer mentions the draftis
a mystery to me. I didn’t.

I ’m suprised that a professor in
GSPIA cannot see that it was Kellv

, who made the simplistic division,

not me. That was one of my

criticism. ,
Another mystery is why Kelly
could not have both cheated the

liberals and used a clever rhetorical
device» they are the same thing.

1"1"l0”.}’. Thayer suggests that The
Pitt News does not address campus

that news coverage is fair ground
for a Pitt News column, especially
when members of the Pitt com-
munity, such as Professor Thayer,

are involved. ,4-

according to McDuffie, is “_embar-
rassment,” to Professor Richard
Blackett of the black studies depart-
ment, who is against the planned
stops in South Africa.

South Africa has continually
been an issue and has had an effect
on the dispositions of various FAS
and CAS discussions. Blackett said
he questioned the air of legitimacy
that such a visit will give to the
system of apartheid, or institu-
tionalized segregation of the races.

“I was asked to go along on the
trip but I refused. The problem I
have with the visit is that for the .
South- African government, their
system is enhanced when anybody
from, the outside goes there,”
Blackett said.

tor of in-port planning, and ‘ex-

ecutive dean of the Semester at Sea
program, defended. the South
African visit on the grounds that “it
gives students a first ‘hand ex-
perience from which they can
decide on their own,” about the
system of apartheid.

Other criticisms came from
history proefssor Richard Galpern,
a FAS member who questioned the
academic merits of the entire pro-
gram.

“This is not_ study abroad; it
doesn’t involve a deep relationship
.or encounter with another culture;
it does not presume a foreign
language nor, except for the courses
in Mandarin Chinese, will it train
them in foreign languages. ' It has
the effect of simulating study
abroad, creating the impression
that this is a substitute for it,”

con tinued from page one

Monday, November 3, l98t)—Page 5

 

Pitt’s 1980 Homecoming King
and Queen added that they are
proud to be chosen as represen-

_ tatives of the university.

 

Galpern said.

“Now that’s not a claim made by
the institute, it’s not a claim made
by Keith McDuffie,” Galpern add-
ed, “but the very nature of the pro-
gram tends to give "that
impression.”

Brandt, while noting that the
Semester at Sea program was not
study abroad, went on to rebut
Galpern’s position. '

“You get a comparative ap-
proach to a particular problem.
Often, we’ll have a student pick out
a problem or theme, and have him
compare this from one geographical
location to another, as opposed to

an in-depth exploration of one area. _

This is very much an introductory
experience in international studies.
It should stimulate further interests
in the students,” Brandt said.

Schlumberger

Many times last year,
Schlumberger engineers, told
oil companies where to go.
Since more “dry holes” are
drilled than producing wells,
oil companies depend on our
opinion on whether or not to
complete this well,
drilling or to go elsewhere.
_ The energy industry
_ depends on our engineering
judgment. If you have the
confidence to accept more
authority and responsibility
than you’ve ever had, consider
‘ joining Schlumberger.

  Panthers Crush Orangemen,

. , down, ‘Warner’s

BY AMIN GHOSSEIN

Pitt News Sports Writer

' Randy McMillan felt right at ,

home in the warm conﬁnes of the
Carrier Dome as he became the first
Pitt back to rush for over 100 yards
this season in leading the Pitt Pan-
thers to a 43-6 thrashing of
Syracusesaturday.

The opening drives for both

‘teams foreshadowed the game.

After receiving the ball on its own
28, the Panthers started a
methodical drive upfield. The of-
fensive line, later praised by coach
Sherrill for its fine performance,
opened up huge gaps in the Orange

defensive line. Going into the game

the Panthers felt that the Syracuse

defensive line was the best they

would face alllyear. Emil Boures,
the starting right gaurd, explained
why.

“On film they never got knocked
back,” he said. “Against Penn
State and Ohio State, they were
never moved back.” A

This first drive ended with a
David Trout field goal of 36 yards.
Trout who went on to kick three
more field goals also boomed all of

A his kickoffs deep into the end zone,

with only one being returned.

This kept the Orange deep in
their own territory throughout the

_ game.

The Orangemen’s first drive was
an omen of things to come. From
their own. 20, Syracuse could only
manage three yards, and on third
pass was in-
tercepted by Sal Sunseri. In an ef-
fort to neutralize the Pitt ‘defense,

4 Syracusecarne out with a no-huddle ‘

offense.. Coach Frank Maloney ex-

 plained" the strategy behind this.

“Pitt is a big blitzing team, and
we felt that if we went with no hud-

._—dle, we could get them off guard,”

he said," “and not give them time to

if ‘set up.’__"_

 The much publicized _confronta-
3 tion between Joe Morris and the
‘Pitt defense turned out to be no

contest. Morris, coming into the
game with a 162 yards per game
average, figured to" give Pitt a stiff
test. It was, however, the Pitt
defense that rose to the occasion as
it limited the dimunative back to a
total of 16 yards on 12 tries.

»a game as he was named the most valuable player by ABC In P|tt’s 43-6 victory over Syracuse

onsaturday. I

“The defense is great and they
didn’t allow us any breathing
room,” Morris said.

While the Pitt defense was doing
its job of containing the‘ explosive

Morris and the Orange offense, the A

Pitt attack was doing its share.

With Rick Trocano completing
20 of 35 tosses for 279 yards and 3
touchdowns, the Panther aerial at-
tack was in full gear. Complemen-
ting the passing attack wasthe ‘run-
ning game. For the second straight
week Pitt rushed for over 200 yards
with McMillan contributing _126 of
those yards.

“The offense is coming together
and I’m coming along with it,”
McMillan said. “We have much

more balance with therun and the .

pass. This year is a lot- like last
year’s where we started _off by not
moving the ball too well but put it
all together at the end of the year.”

With four top teams going down
to defeat (Alabama, UCLA, North
Carolina, and Baylor) the Panthers
stand a very good chance of moving
up in the polls and a major bowl bid
is suddenly within reach.

The Pitt players seemed to know '
this as the atmosphere in the locker .

room was one of renewed hope.

The Week of the Upset In

By. JEFF, DUROSKO
. Pitt News Sports Editor _

Every college football season,
there is a weekend like the one this
country just went through: The
week of the upset. No less than six
members of the Associated Press’
elite top-20 went down to defeat.

‘ The big story to come off the
ﬁeld Saturday was the shocking 6-3
win by Mississippi State over
number-one rakned Alabama.
Alabama was held in check by a

tough Bulldog defense and were

unable to cross the goal-line for the
first time this season and, perhaps,
a few seasons back. The win snap-
ped the nation’s longest college
football winning streak at 28 and
dropped the Tide to 7-1.

The Crimson Tide were not the '

only unbeaten team to be upset
, Saturday,ias the undefeated team is

becoming a thing of the past. Se-
cond-ranked’ UCLA, was dumped
by Arizona 23-17, sixth-rated North
Carolina was destroyed by 16th-
‘ranked Oklahoma 41-7, and No. _10
Baylor was a 30-22 loser to San Jose
State.

Freshman quarterback Tom Tun-
nicliffe led Arizona, passing for two
touchdowns and two 80-yard
drives. _ UCLA had one final
chance, but a long pass by Bruin
quarterback Tom Ramsey was
intercepted, ending the game.

In a big day for quarterbacks,
Oklahoma signal caller .I.C. Watts
ran for 139 yards and scored three

touchdowns in leading the Sooners '

to the win over Carolina.

San Jose State tailback Gerald
Willhite scored- two fourth-quarter
touchdowns to lead his team to a

icome-from-behind upset over the

Southwest Conference
Bears.

There are now only two major
college teams that remain
undefeated.l The Irish of _Notre
Dame, ranked third, preserved their
record with a '33-0 rout of Navy
Saturday as Jim Stone ran for 211
yards on 33 carries. The other
unbeaten, fourth-ranked Georgia,

leading

squeaked by South Carolina on na-

tional television by a score of 13-10.

In other top-20 action, eighth
ranked Nebraska pounded Missouri
38-16 as Jarvis Redwine scored two
touchdowns, gaining 129 yards on
the day. No. 12 Texas, once ranked
as high assecond, was beaten for
the second straight week, this time

by Texas Tech, 24-20. With 1:56 re- .

maining and a fourth-and-12 at his
own 121, Longhorn‘ quarterback

 Donnie Little -dropped back ,to__7 g

 

“We still have a lot of work in
front of us but rightnow we feel
confident,” said‘ Sherrill. “The
players were down_ after the Florida
State game but they just wouldn’t
quit.” 1 ’

“Although enthusiastic about the
win and the potential of moving up
in the rankings, many players ‘ap-
proached the idea -of a national
championship with trepidation.

“It’s possible but we have to get a
lot of breaks,” said Boures.

The Syracuse jinx, which gave the

Panthers fits, was not evident‘ onV
Saturday. Lynn Thomas, the Pan- _

two yards short of a first down.

Ninth-ranked Ohio State had_ lit-
tle trouble with Michigan State as
-the Buckeyes easily defeated, State,
28-16. Heisman Trophy candidate,
quarterback Art Schlichter, threw

sophomore Gary Williams and ran
for another to lead the Buckeyes.

Similarly, No. 18 Michigan
pounded Indiana 35-0 as the
Wolverine offense ran allover the
Hossiers. Lawrence Rick ran 29
and‘.22 yards for touchdowns in a
28-second span in the first quarter
to start off the day’s scoring.

The Pantherette volleyball team
beat Penn State, in a head to head
match up at the Fitzgerald Field
House Friday night. The Panther-
ettes ‘ won three games to two,
(15-11, 15-11,, 14-16, 14-16, 15-10).

For Shelton Collier, coach of the
Pitt team, the win was something of
a disappointment.

“The thing that really happened
in that match, is that Penn State
played worse than we did,” Collier
said. “I don’t think either team
played very well.” ~

Compared to other meetings with

Penn State, Friday’s matchup, ac- »

‘ cording to Collier, was uninspired.
“I’m not exactly sure what it is,”
Collier said. “Our team played
lackadaisically, and uninspired.
They lacked the intensity that I’ve
seen in other matches.”

What added to the disappoint-

ment was that the match was played
before a large hometown crowd.
According. to Collier, the audience
sensed that the Pantherettes could
have done better.

The rectangular building appears
smaller than it is because it is built
on a smallperimeter. The reason
for this can be seen when one goes
inside the facility. The stands are
only 30 feet away from the players.

‘During ‘practice on Friday many

final win was kind of sluggish. I
think that the feeling on the team.
was that we’d win this match
anyway.” '

Collier has been looking to player
combinations and emotional leader-
ship to stir up the team, which he
feels is essential in preparing for the
level of play that they .will en-
counter at the nationals.

“Our execution of skills was not
too bad, but that’s not really
enough,”"Coll'ier said. “We just
didn’t turn on emotionally.”

“In this case we were looking for

_six people who could execute the

plays and play well as an emotional '
unit. We were looking for some

leadership in this from some peo-

ple, and we ‘didn’t really get that

from some of them,” Collier add-

ed.

The often electric performances
of Linda Stadler, and Penn State
star Ellen Kradal, were low key. —

“Both of them were weH below
par,” Collier said. “We’re getting
better and better at holding off
Ellen krandal, and being less in-

timidated by her. But she didn’t
play very well on Friday, and so
Linda didn’t play well either.”

The Pitt team goes against Penn
State once again on Tuesday night
at Penn State. The team will only
have one practice on Monday to
prepare. According to Collier, the
team will almost have to get
together on its own between now
and then. But a big match in
Michigan next weekend should gear
up the Pantherette squad for the
regional tournament scheduled for
November.

it was “like playing in a vacum.”
He was one of the few people who
didn’t seem to appreciate the new

The lighting did not seem to
bother anyone. Freshman Tom
Flynn likes the stadium. '

“The lighting was excellent. It

didn’t bother Inc at all and it was
very exciting playing here,” he said.

There wer"é"'sonie"~setbacks from
the dome. Since the air pressure has
to be at a constant level, there are

only revolving doors which allow‘

the minimum amount of air to
escape the dome. These doors cause
throngs of spectators to wait in line
as one by one they take a spin into
the arena. The other disadvantage is

the humidity. Players said that by .

the fourth quarter, the field was
unbearable.

The visit to Syracuse was a suc-

S cessful one-for the Panthers and it
