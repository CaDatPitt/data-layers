Are you afraid
ofthe dark?  

Pitt students, organizations promote Earth
Hour, call for peers and University to turn off
their lights tomorrow night 1

Olivia Garber
Staﬁ" Writer

Some students are working to
make Pittsburgh a little darker
this Saturday.

Earth ‘Hour, a global energy
awareness campaign that began
three years ago in Sidney, Aus-
tralia, encourages people across
the world to turn off their lights
for one hour to express their
concerns about climate change,
according to the Earth Hour web-
site.

At 8:30 p.m. on Saturday,
buildings such as the Empire State
Building and Pennsylvania’s state
capitol building will turn off their

-lights in accordance with Earth

Hour.

A group of students in the
Campaigns for Sustainability
class taught by Ward Allebach are
working in conjunction with the
Pitt student group Free the Planet
to bring Earth Hour awareness

_to the Pittsburgh area. Free the

Planet works to “instill a passion
for sustainable, environmental-
ly friendly and healthy living in
Pitt’s student body and beyond
through educational events,
community service and various
action-based campaigns,” accord-
ing to its website.

Free the Planet had initially
campaigned to get the Cathedral
of Learning to shut off its lights
on Saturday night,but the Cathe-

that Pitt will shut down.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said the University has plans to
shut off “aesthetic lighting” for
Earth Hour. This includes the lob-
by of the Petersen Events Center,
which Seth Bush, co-president of
Free the Planet, called “a pretty
good chunk of energy.”

Kristen Ostermann, a Pitt
graduate student and mem-
ber of the group, said that the
group’s goal was to increase en-
ergy awareness on campus while
reducing the amount of energy

spent. The goal is part of the se— _' 

mester project, which required
students of the sustainability
class to take part in an energy
awareness campaign."

“Your homework is to go make
a difference,” said Allison Plum-
mer, the teaching assistant for
the class-

Students created a Facebook
group and used posters and word
of mouth to promote Earth Hour.
The group plans to continue its
project after the sustainabil-
ity class ends at the end of the
month. By next year, it is hoping
to start a competition among the
dorms at Pitt to see who can save
the most energy. a

“When people pay a ﬂat rate
for their rooms, they don’t care
if the lights are on,” junior Adam

, Cetra said. “They think they’re

sticking it to the University by
leaving the lights on, but they’re
not.” C

n Saturday, a certain
“Kid From Cleve-
land” will drop by

Pittsburgh. But before he
moves into the spotlight at the
Fitzgerald Field House, a slew
of the Pittsburgh hip-hop over-
achievers will take the stage.

The BNVz (formerly known
as the Beats N Verbz) won
the Pitt Program Council and
WPTS’ Hip—Hop Battle that
was held at Nordy’s Place in
the William Pitt Union Monday
night.

It beat nine other emcees,
turntablists and other hip—hop
based groups to get the only
opening slot for this Saturday’s
Kid Cudi show.

The group’s emcee, producer
and creative director, Mar- '
cus Harris (known as MH the
Verbz), isn’t new to Pitt’s cam-
pus or the localmusic scene.
The super—senior, urban stud-
ies major has been exploring

Pittsburgh’s musical landscape A

since 2004. _
“A lot of people on campus

In Memoriam: Matthew Tembo

/
l

Friends, family remember Pitt—Greensburg student who died in a Carnegie Mellon fraternity house over spring break

John Manganaro
Senior Staff Writer

More than 100 people gathered
last Wednesday in the Mary Lou
Campana Chapel and Lecture
Hall in Greensburg to celebrate
the life of Matthew Tembo, a Pitt
Greensburg student who died
March 7 in Oakland as a result
of alcohol poisoning.

Tembo, a 22-year-old native
of France, died while visiting the
Carnegie Mellon chapter of the
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity for a
birthday celebration, according
to Pittsburgh police detective
Christine Williams. ~

Julie Newman:

Greensburg website.
Students played music by Ja-

son Mraz, one of Tembo’s favorite V

artists. They also read passages
from author Khalil Gibran and
said prayers to express their
feelings about the young man’s
passing. '

Sharon Smith, president of
Pitt—Greensburg, opened the
memorial service by reminding
those attending to see the com-
ing months as a time of healing,
according to the website.

She noted that Tembo was
described as a natural leader, a
diplomat and an exceptional stu-
dent whose perception showed
through his writing, questions

His dynamic nature stood as a

reminder of sorts. You haveto go C

out and enjoy life.

Edward Strimlan, chief foren-
sic investigator for the Allegheny
County Medical Examiner’s Of-
ﬁce, ruled his death an accident
following an autopsy performed
March 8. e .

The students, faculty and
staff who gathered at the ser-
vice shared memories and con-
dolences over Tembo’s passing,
according to a report on thePitt-

and comments.

Other speakers described
Tembo as a strong, conﬁdent
young man who was persuasive,
outgoing and charismatic, the
website says..

Tembo, originally from east-
ern France, transferred to Pitt-
Greensburg in fall 2009 and
majored in management, friends
said. He had been enrolled at

Webster University in St. Louis
and CMU before joining the Pitt
community — transitions Tembo
always made smoothly.

A Michael Murphy, the vice
president of Campus Affairs at
CMU, sent an e-mail to students

and faculty last week in response ‘
to Tembo’sdeath, according to ‘

a report in the The‘Tartan, Car-
negie Mellon’s student newspa-
per.

The letter described Tem-
bo, who was a Pi Kappa Alpha
brother during his time at‘CMU,
as a genuine and sincere person
who was highly motivated in the
classroom._ - .

“While Matt was a A student
here for a short time, he was
widely connected across campus
and within the fraternity and so-
rority communityin particular,”
Murphy wrote. “Among his many

_ activities, he especially loved

soccer, both as a player and a fan.
Tembo’s friends describe him as
personable and outgoing, mak-

ing and maintaining friendships ~
’ easily, with a genuine nature and

sincerity that endeared him to
others.”

Tembo’s immediate family
could not be reached for com-
ment, but many friends and
former classmates shared their
feelings on a Facebook page dedi-
cated to his life in the U.S. and
abroad.’ '

_ “When the ‘Blizzard of 2010’
rolled through in February, a
bunch of us decided to do some
hardcore sledding,” recalled Pitt-
Greensburg studentjulian Critch—

An hour to make the World a greener place

Earth 4 1

“burning coal and contributing
to global warming,” Ostermann
said.

Melissa Bilec, a professor
in the Civil and Environmental
Engineering Department, said,
‘‘There’s a direct relationship
between electricity and carbon
emission through the production
of energy.”

Keeping the lights on might
not appear to be detrimental to
the environment, but Alexander
Dale, director of communica-
tions and technology for the na-
tional chapter of Engineers for
a Sustainable World, said that
the process of producing elec-
tricity is largely inefﬁcient and
subsequently wasteful. ESW is
a national, nonproﬁt network
comprised of students, univer-
sity faculty and professionals who
are dedicated to building a more
sustainable world for current and
future generations, according to
its website. -

Most coal plants, which Penn-

sylvania uses to produce the
majority of its energy, initially

-run at 35 percent inefficiency,

Dale said. As the energy moves
from the plant to the house to
the light switch, it_ continually
loses energy and thus becomes
more inefficient. It doesn’t take
a lot of physical energy to turn
on a light switch, but much of the
energy produced by the burning
of coal is wasted by the simple
task, Dale said.

Turning the lights off could
help.

“You save energy because you
don’t have to account for all the
losses,” Dale said.

While energy will be saved
during Earth Hour, Bush said
the educational component of
the campaign was what the Pitt
student organization was focus-
ing on. _

“In the grand scheme of things,
[Earth Hour] is not much,” Bush

' said, “but being conscious and

turning off your lights every sin-

, gle day — that will make a very
‘ big impact.” - .

Bush and other members of
Free the Planet met in a lecture

‘hall in David Lawrence Wednes-

day night as part of its weekly
gathering. The room had sat emp-

Seth Bush:

“Earth Hour is everywhere in
the world, so anywhere you are,

it is,” Bush said to the group’s.

members. ' . .

Bush called upon the members
to encourage other students to do
more than just turn off their lights

Being conscious and turning off

your lights every single day —

A ty before the meeting, blasted

with ﬂuorescent light that no one
needed. As soon as Bush entered
the room, he turned off the main
lights, giving the room a dim glow
that beﬁtted the topic of Earth
Hour. g

that will make a very big impact.

— unplugging laptops and appli-

_ances that aren’t in use is another

way of conserving energy.

Bush also joked about tak-
ing colder showers as a possible
method of conserving energy.

All group members plan to

shut off their lights during this
time, although sophomore Tubin
won’t have to go to too much
trouble.

“I’ll be at the Kid Cudi concert.
The lights will already be outj’
Tubin said. -

The students of the sustaining
energy class will mainly focus on
getting.an estimate of how many
students participate.

The students plan on using
their Facebook group to get an

accurate count of who partici- ‘

pated. By getting the numbers
for this year, the group will then
be able to see how much energy
was saved, as well as set a goal for
next year, Tubin said.

Free the Planet is also looking
to the future.

“Our hope is to do an energy
awareness campaign after we see
how many students participate,”
Bush said. “Next year, we want

A the University to participate in a

grander scale and get the whole ’
city on board.”

field, one of Tembo’s friends. “I remember
on one of his runs, Matt went down the hill
in front of our building face first and just
disappeared into a snow bank. It is small
moments like that with him that are the
most memorable.”

Critchfield went on to describe Tembo
as always fun—loving and ready to do some-
thing eccentric or exciting.

“His dynamic nature stood as a re~
minder of sorts,” Critchﬁeld said. “You
have to [go out and enjoy life, live it ad-
venturously.” '

Julie Newman, another friend and fel-
low Pitt Greensburg student, recalled how
engaging and eloquent Tembo had been
in the classroom. The two took Cultural
Anthropology together and lived in the
same dorm, she said.

“He always participated in class and
always impressed hislteachers with the
depth of his thoughts and arguments,”
Newman said in an e-mail. “The only
thing was that he had the tiniest hand-
writing. I remember trying to copy his
notes one time. It didn’t work out very

well, but any time spent with Matt was

always fun.”

“I don’t know anyone that didn’t get
along with him,” Newman said. “He was a
presence that is so missed all over campus,
by everyone who knew him.”

Tembo’s athletic abilities also fre-
quently shined through his kind-hearted
demeanor, Newman said, particularly on
the four-square court.

“We played with a Hannah Montana
kick-ball that Matt would always laugh at,’_’
Newman said. “He was pretty much in the
server’s square the entire time we played.
He would always stick around afterward
to just talk and cool off.”

Newman went on to describe one of
the first times she met Matt.

“We were just sitting around and watch-

Sodexo workers discuss unionization

Workers and students met at Prick Fine Arts last night to tell stories, express views on health care and liveable wages.

Simone Cheatham
Staﬁ Writer

Students and Sodexo workers gathered atatown
hall meetingto discuss liveable wages and afford-
able health care last night.

The event, organized by Sodexo workers and
Students insolidaritywith Service Workers, drew
about 70 people in the Frick Fine Arts Audito-
rium. Unionized and non-unionized employees
told stories about their experiences with Sodexo

management and the company in general.
Workers said they wanted higher wages and
lower health care costs, among other issues.
Keely McCaskie, aPittﬁ'eshman and member
of Students in Solidarity with Service Workers,
said this issue affects not only the food service
workers but also the average Pitt student.
“There’s an undeniable connection between
theseworkers andthe students, andwe’re allcon-
nected in this community,” McCaskie said. “We
depend on the workers for our needs, and they

depend on us students for jobs. If the University
turns its head awayfrom these workers, theyare
also utrningtheirhead awayfrom our community
and ultimately, from the students.”

“We hope the Pitt administrationwillpressure
Sodexo and hold them to higher standards,” she
added, referring to health care costs and wages.

Sodexo spokeswoman Monica Zimmer said
Sodexo has a “collective bargaining agreement”
with workers, complying with labor laws and
respecting employees’ rights.

“Sodexo is committed to treatingworkerswith
respect and faimess,” Zimmer said in an e—maiL

Gabe McMorland, president of Pitt’s Blue
Green Alliance —- a partnership between labor
unions and enviromnental advocacy groups —
agreed and said he hopes students become more
involved-in helpingthe workers achieve their goals
of obtaining higher wages and cheaper health
“I don’t think the turnout at this particular
event reﬂects the level of student interest on this
issue,” McMorland said. “This is a much larger
issue of discussion on campus than what was
reﬂected here, andIthinkit’s avalid issue forthe
Pitt community to be involved in.”

Mehvish Ally, president of Pitt Students for
a Democratic Society, said she felt the town hall
meeting was a success and hoped to continue
educating as many people as possible about the
issue.

“Members of my organization and myself
felt the need to be involved in this campaign, and
we’d love to see this movement succeed,” Ally
said. “I hope that more students will be come
involved and that SGB will get on board this is-
sue as well.”

“I just hope this movement doesn’tﬂake out,”
she added.

Students in Solidarity with Service Workers
consists of multiple students and a coalition of
campus organizations addressingand promoting
thewelfare ofthe Sodexo workers. The group has
petitioned around campus and started ane-mail
list and a Facebook group for students.

McMorland said the student group is impor-
tant because it allows students to get involved.

“This is a student issue, not just because we
interactwith these people everyday, but because
Pitt is somewhere we should be proud of,” Mc-
Morland said. “We’re attached to the Pit reputa-
tionforlife, andthe same ethics that are promoted
regularly by the University should extend to these
employees as we .”

Zimmer said the company’s negotiations with
Sodexo employees at Pitt are in its early stages.

“We are optimistic thatwe’ll cometo anagree-.
ment that is acceptable to all parties,” she said.

Cut the red tape to go green

Columnist

A Greenpeace activist approached
me on the street and asked if I’d
like to ﬁght for the cause. I re-
plied, “Yes. May I have a ﬂier?”
She looked at me dumbfounded.
-“No. We’re Greenpeace.”

Environmentalism is difﬁcult,
because there is so much poten-
tial for hypocrisy, or at least in-
consistency. Not everyone has to
be as hard-line as Greenpeace.
It’s important to remember that
doing little things, like changing
to ﬂuorescent light bulbs, is bet-
ter than doing nothing.

It’s been a bad year to be Gaia.
The number of Americans who
don’t believe global warming is a
problemrose to 42 percent, ac-
cording to Rasmussen polls. The
air in Hong Kong got poisonous
this week. The U.N. recently re-

jected trade bans and protections
for polar bears, blueﬁn tuna and
sharks. Tigers are almost extinct.
And more children are growing
up without access to syndicated
episodes of “Captain Planet.”
These are some of the chal-

lenges President Obama faces,

in the coming year. With health
care reform accomplished and
overhauls in all levels of educa-
tion underway, the environment
represents the third priority in
his domestic agenda.

That’s going to be tough with-

out any Republican support. On
Monday, Sen.John McCain said,
“There will be no cooperation for
the rest of the year.” The GOP is
putting the Democrats on time-
out for using reconciliation on
the health care bill. Plus, a new
Harris poll suggests that Repub-
licans simply hate Obama. Ac-
cording to the poll, 67 percent
of Republicans think he is a so-
cialist, 24 percent said that he
“may be the Antichrist” and 38

percent said he is “doing many of
the things that Hitler did.”

Go, planet?

These people, or “hatriots”
as authorjohn Avlon has termed
them, are lunatics with no grasp
of history —— or decency — but
they are loud, audit is an election
year. If cap-and-trade seriously
makes its way to the Senate ﬂoor,
prepare for protesters holding
signs of polar bears with Hitler
moustaches. We all know how
much Hitler liked polar bears
because of their whiteness. If
Obama likes polar bears, then
he may be even more like Hitler.
It all makes sense when I draw
connecting lines. Get Glenn Beck
on the horn.

Unfortunately, this means
that legislators are less likely
to push for environmental leg-
islation. Hard liberals and issue
groups like Greenpeace will. But
environmental legislation needs
wider support.

To really work, Green Fund needs more care

Beitzel 4 7

Councilman Bill Peduto rallied
with environmental activists for
better clean-air standards from
the federal government.
Accordingto the Post- Gazette,
he wants to designate Tuesday
as “Clean Air Act Day” in Pitts-
burgh. Higher air standards are
laudable, Mr. Peduto, but Clean

Air Act Day.‘?..Is .tha,tw_hen Pitts- .

burgh celebrates the day we be-
gan moving toward having the
second most polluted air in the
nation?

The American Lung Associa-
tion ranks Pittsburgh as having
the highest number of fine par-
ticulates in its air. That doesn’t
mean that those particulates are
sexy. It means our air is super
dirty.

Clean Air Act Day doesn’t solve
this problem. It’s lip service. At
worst, it will only result in a lot
of paper used to publicize it.
Tougher federal regulation would
help ﬁght the problem, but this
too must be more than a myopic
stunt. A story in The New York
Times details how Allegheny En-
ergy’s effort to reduce its air pol-
lution just resulted in increased
water pollution. The wastewater
used to trap airborne pollutants

is now dumped into the Monon-
gahela River, “which provides
drinking water to 350,000 peo-
ple and flows into Pittsburgh,”
according to the article.

burgh really — needs more bike
lanes and a better mass-transit
system. But without a plan to
spend the money, the Green Fund
risks appearing like a naive, feel-

his forthcoming green initiatives
are more than just chatter. He
has to ensure that they address
the beating the earth has been
getting, and he has to ensure that

Astbetter environment isn’tjust for white seals and .

Walt Whitman scholars. it benefits everyone, in

health and even possiblyin employment.

Meanwhile, Pitt student
groups are getting involved in
environmental efforts with the
Green Fund. Basically, it’s a
proposal to start a new group
called the Student Sustainable
Projects Committee. This group
would raise revenue with a $5
per-semester fee from students,
donations and recycling revenue
and then decide on which proj-
ects to spend the money.
This could create some fresh
ideas on how to turn Oakland
green. Oakland — and Pitts-

good slush fund. Right now, the
proposal intends to collect a fee
without a plan to spend it. It’s
like saying, “We don’t know what
we’re doing, but pollution is a
problem you should care about,
so we’ll take your money in the
meantime.”

A better environment isn’t just
for white seals and Walt Whitman
scholars. It benefits everyone,
in health and even possibly in
employment.

Same as Peduto and the Green
Fund, Obama has to explain why

they don’t deliver a new beating
to an already struggling working
class. He cannot allow Ameri-
cans to think he’s spending their
money on vagaries.

He can do this by linking en-

vironmental efforts to jobs and
the economy. “Tired of paying
for gas? Buy the new Chrysler
electric car. Here’s a tax cred-
it.” “Tired of taking paycuts to
keep your dead-end job? Apply
for positions with these green
start-ups. Here’s some grant
funding.”

Much like an ecosystem, a
green economy is complex. It is
layered and intertwined within
itself. A bustling renewable,en-
ergy sector creates jobs. Its cre-
ative and lucrative nature attracts
smart, inspired workers. They
expand an industry, which pays
federal taxes that can be used

to reduce deﬁcits or reinvest in

research and development. Bet-
ter technology and return on
investment opens these goods
up to consumers. When they’re

involved en masse, supporting‘.

a green economy with a green
lifestyle, proportionate reduc-
tion in pollution follows.

Whoa, I’d better pump the
brakes. All this trickle-down
has got me sounding like a Re-
publican. Or maybe all this green
talk has got me sounding like an
environmentalist.

But it can’t be both because
they’re supposed to be mutu-
ally exclusive. Conservatives
hate conservation — almost as
much as they hate cooperating
with liberals. '

BNVz inaugurates move to ‘urban pop’

Picked to open for Kid Cudi at Fitzgerald Field House, hip-hop group BNVz discusses its 3 years onlthe Pittsburgh scene.

started going to shows, hanging
out and writing music in his base-
ment,” Harris said. V

The idea to form their own
version of a hip-hop band in the
same vein as The Roots and Hei-
ruspecs wasn’t far behind.

The group quickly took form
and by 2007 released its debut
album, We B/ozuirz Up.

and I feel like if you have that tal-
ent then you should showcase it,”
Harris said.

Several of BNVz’_s members
come from jazz and other back-
grounds. This diversity con-
tributes, rather than hinders
though.

bring a lot of things together,”

In that same year, however, it
decided on a change in music di-
rections. Several members parted
ways while Harris and keyboard

on, collaborating with a multitude
of Pittsburgh’s musical talent.

“A lot of artists work with us,

Harris said. “I don’t classify our

more.”

(describes as “urban pop.”

The emcee’s personal style
also factors into the group’s ap-
proach. ‘

“I’m interested in telling sto-
ries with my songs,” he said. That

lyrical storytelling is part of one‘

of the group’s next projects, a new
album called Narcissism that will

tackle the cultural “obsession

with your own being.”

The group is hopeful that it
will be the ﬁrst in a series examin-
ing differences and their associ-
ated woes.

Before any album can be re-
leased though, the BNVz has
several performances around
Pittsburgh opening for hip-hop
legends and heavy-hitters alike.

Cudi, next Wednesday with Cleve-
land’s Bone Thugs—n-Harmony
and April 9 with Philadelphia’s

commitments, the group mem-
bers continue to ‘make music at
a staccato pace (even if it isn’t
particularly hip-hop). _

Harris said. “Before the DJ, there

FILM REVIEW

Cusack, Corddrydeliver ‘tub’ of funny

MGM Studios presents a ’co'niical»throwback to the age of frizzy hair and cassette tapes in ‘Hot Tub Time Machine.’

Andy Tybout ‘
Staff Writer _

“Hot Tub Time Machine”

- _Directed by: Steve Pink

Starring: John Cusack, Clark
Duke, Craig Robinson, Rob
Corddry

MGM Studios

Grade: B+

Film scholars, cinephiles and

, audiences looking for more out of

movies than just entertainment,
beware the following lines: “Must
be some kind of  hot tub time
machine ...”g

, Fortunately, the rest of us will

get exactly what we’re expecting

out of the blatantly titled “Hot
Tub Time Machine” — a funny,
dumb and good—natured comedy
with about as much longevity as
hair metal. ‘

It: seems almost redundant,

/1»:-u :.

but here’s the ‘plot: A hapless

insurance salesman (John Cu- ’

sack) and his two middle-aged
buddies (Rob Corddry and Craig
Robinson) travel with Cusack’s
young nephew (Clark Duke) to a
"ski lodge they used to frequent

in their youth, hoping to reclaim .

some shred of the free—spirited
past. _

Much to their dismay, they ar-
rive to ﬁnd the surrounding town

sorrier shape than their lives.

All is not lost, however. Their
room’s hot tub, into which they
stumble in a last—ditch'effort at
fun, is also —— spoiler alert '— a
time machine.

After a night of drunken de-
bauchery, they awake to ﬁnd

themselves in that comedic fan- .

tasyland of frizzy haircuts and
cassette players —- 1986.

But far from being handed a
second lease on life, the men have

to ensure their night goes exactly
as it did on that date in the past,

or else,-as a mystical Chevy Chase

warns, some butterﬂy effect will
trigger and in the words of Clark
Duke, ‘‘we’ll make Hitler presi-
dent or something.”

From then on, the ﬁlm fol-
lows a cycle similar to the re-
cent crop of R-rated comedies:
an increasingly ridiculous spree
of slapstick, drugs and genitalia
jokes.

ALBUM REVIEW

Album more  
than just ‘Static’

Alison Smyth A
Staﬂ” Writer

Static of the Gods
Knowledge Machine
Released: March 23
Rating: C+

. Label: delverano Records

Rocks like: The Duke Spirit
meets Silversun Pickups

Static of the Gods’ first record,

Knowledge Machine, might be ’

more in touch with nature than
most bands’.

The band’s songs sound like
your regular rock fare, but or-
ganic inﬂuencesmight surprise
the listener. The music might be
more balanced than the average
garage band with its female sing-
er and inﬂuences such as “sun,
moon, stars; land, sea” listed on
the band’s Myspace page.

Whether Static of the" Gods
ﬁnds balance in the great out-

doors or in the symmetrical
nature of the three-piece, the
sounds ﬁt well either way. ‘

Songs like. “Rest Your Head”
ﬁll _every space with crashing
drums and reverberating guitar
like Silversun Pickups. Whereas
Silversun Pickups would add a
raspy, screaming vocal, Static
of the Gods takes a different ap-
proach. - ,

Jen Johnson’s vocals take the-

would-be dark rock song and cre-

ate a yin-yang sound. Her voice ~
allows for contrast to the rough-

ness of the instruments without
sounding too sweet.

Static of the Gods perfects
the soft and strong with “Meteor
Flights.”]ohnson’s slight soprano
pushes from the low rumbling
guitar and bass notes forming a
clever dance.

Knowledge Machine lives up
the band’s name: Static-like re-
verbs, cosmic influences and a
natural balance of sound. M

Film full of ’80s gags, squirrels

,‘Hot Tub’ 4 9 l

Throw in a few feel-good song
numbers (hopepyou like Miitley
Criie) and a few cameos and what
you’ve got is a foolproof, albeit
predictable, comedy —— which,
for anyone who’s seen the trail-
ers, ‘should be expected.

“The Daily Show”-vet Rob Cord-
dry, who inhabits the archetypal
belligerent a**hole disturbingly
well.

Other performances pull
their own weight. Craig Robin-
son is lovable as always, Cusack

There’s not a soulin the

world ‘that’s seen the ‘Kick
Some Past’ posters and still

thinks this movie will be about

anything more than a hot tub
that’s also a timelmachine. _

The ﬁ1m’s greatest strength
is its returning gags, including,
but not limited to an ever-present
squirrel, a one-armed doorman,

' a “Red Dawn”-worshipping jock

and of course, everything that
was ever popular in the ’8os.
The acting ranges from mem-
orableto solid. On the “memo-
rable” side of the spectrumis

is a sympathetic straight man,
and Clark Duke, while far from
stealing the show, channels the
“awkward adolescent” as well as
anyone. '

The only aspect of the ﬁlm that
feels strained is its half-hearted
attempt to interject a message
about fate and “embracing the
chaos” into an otherwise absurd

setting. '

If I were director Steve Pink,
I’d make sure to slash anything
that elevated “Hot Tub Time Ma-
chine” above a celebration of the
stupid."

But in a ﬁlm so otherwise glee-
fully resistant to meaning, such
preaching was but a minor blip
in the fun.

Like its predecessor, “Snakes
on a Plane” (2006), the genius
of “Hot Tub Time Machine” is its
marketing strategy. ‘

There’s not a soul in the world
that’s seen the “Kick Some Past”
posters and still thinks this movie
will be about anything more thaii
a hot tub that’s also a time ma-
chine. '

If you’re looking for an intel-
lectual tease, “Shutter Is1and”
might make for a more reward-
ing outing.

But if you want a giggle-in-
ducing, f-bomb-dropping romp
with enough ’8os references to
make even those born in the ’90s
feel nostalgic, then as the lovably
inane trailers assure us, getiready
tovkick some past. A

Titus Andronicus’ sophomore release proves a thoughtful — and thought- provoking — sequel.

Andronicus achieves a dynamic sound that
its ﬁrst album lacked.

Labeling The Manitoras a risk to this world
dominated by 3-minute pop songs is a seri-
ous understatement.

_ Tbe Monitor is a concept album with ﬁve
songs more than 7 minutes long, including
the last 14-minute anthemic track, “The
Battle of Hampton Roads.” The album in its

’" entirety is a unique musical experience. . ‘

You cannot look at the songs individually
because together they form a message that

. waits to be uncovered.

Within the emotional inelting pot that
Titus Andronicus concocts, the mesh of
intense love songs, civil war salutes and
the same old punkrock elements put a new
twist on contemporary subjects.

They aren’t afraid to ask why. It’s a re-
freshing slap in the face and a much-needed
back ‘pedal into what music used to be.

The Monitor is a trophy of improvement

The men’s and women’s swimming

season in mid-October against
St. Bonaventure, and the past six
months were up and down for both
teams.

After ﬁnding success in the Big

any members of either squad to
the NCAA Swimming_ and Diving
Championships.

Earlier in the season, head
coach Chuck Knoles cited the
team’s mental toughness to be an
issue. However, he was quick to
point out his team’s improvement
from last year.

Both Pitt teams suffered losses

Duquesne dominance continues

Pitt ’s neighbor won the City Match for the third year in a row on Tuesday.

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

The words “very disappointed”
were followed by a crisp silence.
That’s all Pitt women’s tennis head

— coach George Dieffenbach’ could

muster after the Panthers fell to
Duquesne 5-2 for the third year
running Tuesday at The Club in
Monroeville, taking Pitt’s record
to 5-3 on the season. .
Though Pitt holds a 23-11 all-
time record over its cross—town
foe, the Dukes have dominated the

the credit to the victor.

“Duquesne is a very good team,
a very strong team,” Dieffenbach
said in a phone interview. “They
hit the ball very hard. They’re also
smart in terms of playing defensive
tennis.” L 1 '

Pitt fell behind early, dropping
all three doubles matches to go
down 1-0. '

Junior Elizabeth Adams and

matches to seal a victory.

“That doubles point is critical,”
he said. “It’s psychologically very

WRESTLING
Team wins,
individual
awards

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

Last month the Pitt wrestling team
won its ﬁrst EasternWrestlingLeagu_g
season title in school history, and on
Wednesday the Panthers picked up
two individual accolades.

Pitt head coach Rande Stottle-
myer was named EWL Coach of the
Year, and Anthony Zanetta won EWL
Freshman of the Year.

“The reason I got it is because
of the two assistants, Jason Peters
and Matt Kocher,” Stottlemyer said.
“They did a great job with our guys
every day of the season.”

Tliisistliefourthﬁmehehaswon
the award in his 31 years at Pitt. The
others were 2oo7~o8, 1989-90 and
1986-87.

Stottlemyer and the Panthers
ﬁnished the year 17-1-1 and beat Ed-
inboro 21-13 in the last dual meet of
the season to capture theirﬁrstEWL
regular season crown.

“He deserves it, along with the
coachingstaff,” Zanetta said. “He has
three great coaches, and they are all
very dedicatedto us. That’s theirmain
priority— us.” ..«.

During his freshman campaign,
Zanetta was a little inconsistent at
times, according to Stottlemyer,
which he said is to be expected with
any freshman.

But Zanetta said he thinks he can
improve next year, especially aaér‘
what he learned from the coaching
staff this year, when “in tough situ-
ations to relax and don’t over think
things.

“Theytaught mealot about being
mentally strong. The conﬁdence levei.
they gave me was great. They kept me
motivated all season.”

Zanetta ﬁnished the year 34-10,
giving him the 10th most wins in a
single season by a Panther. He also
won the 125-pound weight division‘
at the EWL Championships March

7 by beating West Virginia’s Shane '

Young.

put in an impressive ﬁrst—place ﬁnish.

Standout freshman swimmer Adam Mac-
zewski from Poland and Jake Lucas have
performed consistently well for the men’s
team throughout the season, as have junior
divers Collin Forner and Zane McLain.

Lucas, who won the co—Swimmer of the
Eastern College Athletic Conference Cham-
pionships award, broke the longest standing
record in Pitt’s history books this season. In
the men’s 100-yard ﬂy event of the Big East
Championships, he posted a meet record
when he ﬁnished in 47.24 seconds in the
ﬁnals.

Lucas was also a member of two relays
that garnered ﬁrst place ﬁnishes and set
ECAC records. ‘

Lucas’ team was made up of Otto Pagel,
Donald Mata and Andrzej Dubiel. They com-
bined for a NCAA provisional time of 1:21.53,
just under the previous ECAC standard of
1:21.54. ‘

Pitt’s 200—yardi medley relay team
earned an ECAC crown and set a

meet record with a time of 1:29.53.

Pitt’s 200—yard medley relay team (Lucas,
Pagel, Maczewski and seniorjonathan Buch-
anan) earned an ECAC crown and set a meet
record with a time of 1:29.53. The previous
record was set at 1:31.28 in 1999.

Maczewski earned all—Big East honors
this season and set school records in the
men’s 1oo—yard backstroke event. In the
Big East Championship, he turned in a sec-
ond place ﬁnish in the same event with a
time of 47.73 and set a school record last

held by teammate Dubiel. Had a Louisville

competitor not won the event, Maczewski
would have also qualiﬁed for a Trees Pool
record with his time. He was the lead leg of
the 400-yard medley relay team that ﬁnished
fourth overall.

At the NCAA Diving Zones, McLain placed
10th on the 3—meter board with 298.25 points
in the preliminary round. He ﬁnished 13th
in the ﬁnals, with 570.55.

Forner placed 20th in the preliminary
round on the 3-meter board with 258.40.

For the women’s team, senior swimmer
Lisa McDonnell and freshmanjoanna Budzis
led the way. McDonnell competed in the ﬂy,
back and free events, and Budzis participated
in the free and individual medley events.

In the meet against Louisville, McDonnell

won the 2o0—yard free event (1:50.67) and _

placed second in the 100-yard free event
(51.25). She was the lead leg of Pitt’s 400-
yard free relay team that ﬁnished second.
In addition to McDonnell, the relay included
sophomores Ele-
na Spak, Yolandi
Van Rooyen and
Kristen McMul-
Ian.

0 r i gi n a l 1 y
from Warsaw,
Poland, Budzis
broke her fresh-
in an s e as o n
record on the
third night of the Big East Championships.
She re—wrote the freshman record to 1:49.65
and improved to ﬁfth overall in the 200-yard
free. Budzis earned all-Big East Honors for
the 200 individual medley.

Junior diver Mallory Mullady found suc-
cess in the Big East Diving Championships,
as she advanced to the ﬁnals of the 1-meter
board. Her best dive of the night was her
second, on which she collected 49.2 points.
She ﬁnished eighth overall, totaling 265.15

points.

ANALYSIS

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

What the heck happened to the Big
East this year? ,

The widely acclaimed, big, bad
and best conference in America sent
eight teams to the NCAA Tournament
this year. After one weekend of play,
two remain in Syracuse and West
Virginia.

Here are the teams that beat Big
East teams, with their seed, in the
Tournament: (6) Xavier, (11) Wash-
ington, (10) St. Mary’s, (8) California,
(11) Old Dominion and last but not
least, (14) Ohio.

That’s not exactly a laundry list of
dominant teams.

Ohio ﬁnished ninth — ninth! —
in the Mid-American Conference this
year. Its record against teams such
as Kent State, Akron -——— everyone
but Michigan and Buffalo — was a
grand 7-9. »

The Bobcats won in overtime

at Ball State to qualify for the MAC A
“ tournament, then beat Akron in over-

time in the ﬁnals to get the automatic
berth.Thentheybeat Georgetown 97-
83 inthe ﬁrst round. Fourteen points
doesn’t do justice to this blowout.

Georgetown looked sluggish
beyond comparison against Ohio
throughout the entire game. Rarely
did they show ﬂashes of the brilliant
team that pushed West Virginia to
the brink for the Big East Champi-
onship.

The telling stat is that Georgetown
shot 50 percent from the ﬁeld. It’s
telling because the Hoyas’ defense
was so bad that making halfof their
shots wasn’t even close to enough
offense.

All year the Hoyas were ajekyll
and Hyde squad. They looked Fi-
nal Four—caliber against Duke and
in the Big East tournament yet fell
ﬂat against Rutgers, South Florida
and Ohio.

The ﬁrst day started off horribly
for the Big East, with Notre Dame
fallingto Old Dominioninthe second
game on the schedule last Thursday.
Old Dominion held Irishforward Luke
Harangody to a mere four points on

just 2-of-9 shooting from the ﬁeld.

Villanova struggled in overtime
to beat Robert Morris in the open-
ing round and ultimately lost to St.
Ma.iy’s in the second round.

Pitt looked dominant against Oak-
land but couldn’t do enough late in its
game against Xavier.

Syracuse’s Wes Johnson, carried the
Orange past Gonzaga, scoring 31
points and grabbing 14 rebounds.
Syracuse mopped the ﬂoorwith Gon-
zaga, winning 87-65.

West Virginia forward Da’Sean
Butler led his team with 28 points in
the Mountaineers’ gritty 68-59 win

Maybe ‘the top teams in the Big

East’ isn’t synonymous to ‘the top

teams in the country’ anymore.

Marquette fell to Pac-10 foe
Washington by two. Louisville lost
to another Pac-10 team, California,
by 15.

That leaves two teams, but what
a great two teams they are.

Syracuse and West Virginia played
out the season as the Big East’s top
two teams, and deservedly, they sur-
vived the ﬁrst weekend.

The Big East Player of the Year,

 

over Missouri.
Maybe, as media and fans, we
overvalued the Big East this year.

"Maybewe didn’trealizethatlastyear 1

was lastyear and that “the top teams
in the Big East” isn’t synonymous to
“the top teams in the country” any-
more.

Or maybe the mid-major teams,
and for that matter teams across all
of Division I, are catching up with the

zw.

 

Now OPEN

Big East offerspoor showing in NcAAs-

7 Despite the orice—high expectations, the normally powerful conference has performed subpar.

Big East after last year’s talent exile.

It’s clear, however, thatthis league
hadn’t lost its luster prior to the NCAA
Tournament.

The NCAA selection committee
held the Big East in such high hopes.
The committee gave top three seeds
to all but two Big East teams, suggest-
ing that they believed these teams
were good enough to advance to the
Sweet 16 and beyond.

If they had a second crack, I’m_not
so sure the Big East would receive
eight bids.

These losses weren’t about ref-
erees or Big East teams adjusting f5
playing different types ofbasketball.
Big East teams were overrated, and
hopefully next year, the commit-
tee won’t make the same mistake

again.

The result of these losses is fur-
ther proof that the gap between col-
lege basketball teams is closing. This
should be exciting, as it shows that no
matter what conference patch is on
ateam’s shoulder, come Tournament
time, a team still simply has to Wll
to advance.

but his work ethic helped him as the season

went on,” Stottlemyer said. “He didn’t have

any big dives. [Freshmen] don’t know how long
wﬂie season is.”

Zanetta also mentioned the season’s length
as one of the biggest difficulties to overcome
his freshman year. He said in high school he
typically wrestled about 40 matches per year,
and this year he competed in about 45.

“It was a long year of wrestling that’s hard
on your body,” he said. “Once it gets going, it

flies by, though.”

Thanks to his EWL win, Zanetta also com-
peted inthe NCAA Championships March 18-20
in Omaha, Neb. Afterwinninghis opening bout
against Cal State-Fullerton’s Andre Gonzalez,
he lost his next two matches, ending his trip
to nationals.

“This year seta good foundation for the rest
of my career going forward,” Zanetta said, add-
ing that he’s lookingto improve on his “strength
and technique” for next year.

 
   

Stottlemyer said he expects Zanetta to prog-
ress next year because of the freshman’s work
ethic.

“He’ll be workingall summer,” Stottlemyer
said. “He wants to get better now. He doesn’t
want to wait anymore.”

Zanetta said his personal goal for next year
is to earn All-American status, which teammate
Tyler Nauman did this year. ’

But that’s notallzanettawantsto improve on
from a freshman season in which his Panthers

ﬁnished ranked No. 18 in the nation.

“Our goal is to win [the EWL] again and try
to get ourrankingup as high aswe can,” Zanetta
said. “Our goal is to be top 10 next year. We’re
already talking about it, and we can do it.”

If the Panthers are set to do that, Zanetta
ﬁgures to be a big part of the team once again,
and that sounds good to Stottlemyer.

“He’s got a big smile on his face, and he just -

loves wrestling,” Stottlemyer said. “It’sjustfun
to be around him.”

just as good, if not better, than the teams
Pitt faces in the Big East, which features
two top-25 programs in Notre Dame (No. 3
in thenation) and DePaul (No. 23).

“The competition we faced against
Duquesne was as strong or stronger than
the competition we face in the Big East
tournament and Big East regular season,”
Dieffenbach, who has been coaching at Pitt
for 33 years, said. “We just lost to a very
good team.” p

The Panthers next shift back to league
play, when they travel to Philadelphia to
take on Villanova today at 1 p.m. ’

Pitt has nine Big East matches remaining
on its schedule, and a visit to Villanova could
be the perfect remedy for a team reeling
after a loss in a rivalry match.

Pitt holds a 13-6 lifetime edge over the .

Wildcats and has won the last four regular
season clashes between the two schools.

“We’ll be ﬁne. We’ll bounce back from
it,” Dieffenbach said.
