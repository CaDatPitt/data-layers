Stanley Cup celebrations more 0

peaceful than after Super Bowl

by Liz Navratil
New Egitor

A less—populated Oakland still
managed to throw a party after
the Penguins beat the Detroit Red
Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals
Friday night, but the celebration
was far tamer than the post-Super
Bowl riots.

“We had a good night in Oak-
land,” city police spokeswoman
Diane Richard said in an e—mail.
“It was all excited revelry, no dam-
age.”

Following the Penguins’ 2-1 vic-
tory, an estimated 1,000 to 1,500

people celebrated in Oakland and b

about 3,000 celebrated in the South
Side.

Richard said ﬁreﬁghters re-
sponded to'two chair ﬁres in Oak-
land Friday night — one on Semple
Street and one on the corner of
Meyran Avenue and Sennott Street;
They arrested one person for ignit-
ing a chair, and it was their only
arrest in Oakland. b

Police arrested 31 people for
failure to disperse in the South
Side, where people hoisted alumi-
num mock-ups of the Stanley Cup
and ran through the streets. Police

received initial reports of damage

near 14th Street, but didn’t ﬁnd any

He’s developed a series of traditions
over the past few years —wean'ng the

ing out of the same cup, holding his
Pens towel a certain way and 
games at his house with his friends.
But for this year’s postseason,
McGrath decided to grow the playoff
beard — a mane that loyalists grow

' alongside actual members of the team

—-—thathe shavedonlyafterhis team

For McGrath, it was the first time
hehadgrownanysortof facialhair,
and for the first three weeks of the
playoffs, he couldn’t stop scratching
his stubble

The itch eventually disappeared, but
the luck stayed. The Penguins beat the
Det:roitRed\V1ngs 2—l,thanks,inpart,
to McGrath’s his hairy mug. Or so he
likes to think

The beard’s good fortune reached
beyond success on the ice. McG/rath

Judges delay trial for

alleged threat caller

by Liz N avratil
Newd Editor

Federal judges will wait untiljuly
to set a trial date fora former Pitt
student accused of making threats
that caused police to evacuate two
University buildings in April 2008.

The U.S. Attorney’s office ex-
tended for a second time the dead-
line for Louisa Ewuresi Nkrumah,
of Harrisburg, to ﬁle pre—trial mo-
tions. Pre—tria1 motions are anything
that would ‘affect the need to have
or the conduct of a trial.

The deadline for Nkrumah -
charged with using a telephone to
“willfully threaten  unlawfully
damage or destroy” the Cathedral
of Learning and Posvar Hall — to
file her pre—trial deadlines was ex-
tended, ﬁrst from April 15 to June
1, and then again from June 1 to
July 1. O ,

In both cases, the deadlines were
extended to give Nkrumah’s attor-
ney, Cynthia Eddy, “reasonable time
necessary” to prepare a defense,
according to courtidocuments.

If found  Nkrumah could
face up to 10 years in prison, a
$250,000 fine or both.

Eddy declined to comment on
the case, saying “the communica-
tions between me and my client are
conﬁdential.”

Nkrumah declined to comment,
as well.

i It is common for pre—trial mo-
tions to be extended. V
Adam Goldstein, an attorney for

"the Student Press Law Center, said

he would be surprised if Nkrurnah’s
trial lasted more than a week. He
said he thought there would be “a
relative minimum of evidence — a
few core things that link a person
or fail to link someone to whatever
the phone was and whatever the
time was.”

Longer trials, he said, tend to
occur when cases require a large
amount of evidence. Cases for tech
fraud tend to take longer because
jurors must sift through many
documents before deciding on the

Pens Beard-A-Thon raises thousands for cancerresearch

Beards, page l

machine, they entered the “Beard-A-
Thon,” a charity event sponsored by
the Pittsburgh Penguins for the Mario
Lernieux Foundation, an organization
founded by Penguins legend Mario
Lemieux and dedicated to cancer re—
search

The team ﬁnished second oh the
Penguin’s online Beard—A-Thon lea-
derboard yesterday, raising $7,933.25.
The community of Penguins fans who
participated in the Beard—A—Thon raised
more than $109,975, more than ev-
ery other team in the NHL who par-
ticipated in their own Beard-A-Thon
programs i .

The men on the Hefren-Tillotso
team sent our weekly e-mails to co-
workers  for pledges in support
of their beards, amid taunting from‘
older ﬁrm members that theywere too
young to grow facial hair;

But the beards grew — full And
they generated a good luck cycle that
went from beard to ice and back to
beard ’

“We think the days we got the most
donations were the days we won the
games,” Hucko said i

Large donations ensured victory
on the ice, which gave the beards more
timetogetlonger, andaccordingto
hockey tradition", the more beard, the
more luck.

It was destiny. It was unstoppable
Itwas an auto—piloted course to Stanley
Cup glory started by three beards, the
members thought.

The tradition of  playoff ’

beardsdatesbackyearsbeforeitbecame
aprofrtable charity fundraiser. ‘Male fans
whowanttheirteamtowinwillnot
shave from the start of the playoffs
until the team either loses or wins the
Stanley Cup, just as many of the hockey

-players they’re watching do.

No one knows exactiy how orvwhen
the tradition started, butjohn Cimper-
man, apartnerin theCinergycompany
running the Beard-A-Thon, said, “It
started somewhere in the mid ’80s‘with
the New York Islanders.”

The planning began last October,

andNHLteamsbegantoshowinterest._

Ofthe16NHLteamswhopar_ticipated
in the playoffs, nine allowed Cinergy
to run Beard-A-Thon  for
their fan base

"The fans of the Penguins have
been absolutely phenomenal,’ ’ Cimper—
man said. “It’s a testament to their pas-
sion as  fans”

Regardless of why the tradition
started, male Penguins fans agree that
there are few better ways’ to support
their team during playoff time, even
while the women in their  might
berepulsed by h. ‘

‘ ‘My mom didn’t like the beard, but
Ihadito keep_tellingheritwasplay—
off time,”  Pitt senior
Weigand said.

Weigand said he grewabeard purely
because he thought it would bring luck
to the team. He grew one for last year’s

playoffs, when the Penguins were only T
g a few goals away from  the

Stanley Cup, so he decided to grow
one 

There was an itchy phase for him
too, but he endured it Now that the
playoffs have ended, Weigand still hasn’t
shaved off his beard, a possible violation
of the tradition ‘

There is controversy in the hockey
world about the time  of
beard growth -— exactly when toistart

it and when to shave it.

“Oncethe playoffs areover, sois the
beard,” McGrath said. "The tradition
has always beenthatyou shavewhen
you win the cup. The players have and
so have we.” ,

Darren Hucko also shaved his
beard Saturday, the day after the Pen-
guins won the Stanley Cup. He said
he felt he had used up every ounce of
luck in his beard, and also recognized
that “it’s hard to rock the scruffy beard
with a suit.”

Besides sticking tothe traditions of
hockey and the workplace, the men on
the HeEren—T'1llotson team responded
to pressure from their wives.

When Richmond got home from
playing golf last Saturday, his wife told
him she .wouldn’t kiss him until he had
shaved the beard. He had no choice but
to shave it off ‘

McGrath’s wife bought champagne.

\When he asked. her what theywould
have done had the Penguins lost, she
said that regardless of the outcome,
it was a celebration of his beard com‘-

Safety cause of curb extension

by Joe Kennedy
Staﬂ Wrder

Summer construction blocking off sections
of road along Forbes Avenue is part of a pe-
destiian and biker safety initiative.

Sidewalk curb extensions, enhanced street
 and pedestrian islands —-— which make
it safer for travelers to cross multiple—lane streets
— and traffic lights will be added to Oakland
streets as part of the plan sponsored by the state
Department of Transportation and the Oakland
Transportation Management Association.

T 2;; 1:, Mr: ow E‘.l'-.‘lEl..‘!.

Construction occurs on Forbes Avenue be-
tween McKee Place a.nd South Bouquet Street
between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Mondays through
Fridays and is expected to be ﬁnished by the
end of the year.

The project began in 2003 with a resurfac-.
ing of Forbes Avenue, according to an OTMA
news release More than $2.1 million in federal
 was awarded for the construction, which
includes  for changes previously made to
Fifth Avenue near the Meyran Avenue, Atwood
Street, DeSoto Street and Thackeray Avenue
intersections. 5

 Quiet r1ot ensues %

 after Stanley Cup

, When Barack Obama won the

 just not as hard.

1 Remember the post—Super Bowl
 “celebration” that engulfed Oakland?
 Pitt students, especially those who par-

 never forget. , -

: While couch burning has long
 been a fashionable ritual, Pitt students
 couldn’t leave it to that. In the name
 of celebration, Pittsburghers wanted

 destruction, and that’s what we got

The question still looms: Have Pitt
students learned from their irnperti—

 have raised the bar dictating how not
 to celebrate Or, maybe students really

victory provides some insight; Pitt
students, or at least the ones 
in Oakland for the summer, ﬂooded
Forbes Avenue once  But un-
like its predecessor, this celebration
proved, well, more of an actual cel-
ebration than a riot; . V _

Forget the broken windows and
razed bus stops. This gathering fea-
tured only jovial high—ﬁves between

, pedestrians and motorists waving their
 arms from car windows. No sirens

 here, just mirthful chants of “I.et’s

'  go Pens!” Enthusiastic fans kept the

j celebration to the sidewalk. Traffic
 was slowed but not stopped. .

 While the police presence was felt,
 officers only made one arrest (for

i   a chair) among the estimated

 1,000 to 1,500 partiers in Oakland
 after the Stanley Cup. Fireﬁghters
 responded to two chair ﬁres in Oak-
 land. Among the 3,000 celebrators

0

 in the South Side, ofﬁcers made 31 i

 arrests. -During the Super Bowl riots,
 Pitt police estimated _60 to 80 arrests

in Oakland.

For Oakland, the Stanley Cup 

victory celebration established a new
precedent  we hope. Believe it or not, I

Oakland can celebrate peacefully. But :
what if the Steelers notch another Su- 

per Bowl victory next year? Hopefully,
the Pitt student body won’t relapse

__ We can’t ignore how the majority
of ‘Pitt students weren’t here to join
the crowd on "Forbes. Were most Pitt
students not home for the summer,

perhaps the celebration would have I

escalated back into frenzy.

0 As an ensuing result of the post-
Super Bowl mayhem, police made
sure violators wouldn’t get away free
Dozens of students faced suspension
after the University scanned security

video recordings and even Facebook {
to catch perpetrators. i

These fears still  among Pitt

students. We all realize that while it’s A

ﬁm to go wild_in the streets, it’s just
not worth  suspended And on
top of that, the University/s 
to subdue Pitt’s party mentality is still
ﬂesh in our minds, even though the
University administration has taken

down the persuading posters 

We can’t be sure how the Steel-
ers, the Pens "or the Panthers will fair
next year, but it seems as if Pitt and

» the Pittsburgh area will never lose its

fervor for their teams '

Butin light of the media coverage
surrounding the Super Bowl riots, Pitt
students still have a stigma to over-

_come. Oakland saw a more orderly,

behaved celebration after the Stanley
Cup victory. ' _ 0
Yet overall, this was still a small-
scale celebration. A fraction of the '
student body set a good example, and

let’s hope the rest will follow it once 
the majority of Pitt’s student body 
returns in the fall. The 2009 Stanley 
Cup Penguins victory should serve 
as a microcosm for any future sports—

Fine, I’ll admit it: I’m a fan of ’

- Korean boy bands.

Before rushing to judgment,
though, please know that it’s not
the spiked hair,  beats or in-
comprehensible lyrics that have me
hooked ‘— although they certainly
don’t hurt. It’s just that, with a 24-
hour Asian pop-TV channel avail-
able in my apartment in Ulaanbaatar,
Mongolia, it’s difficult not to feel a
degree of middle school nostalgia
with each passing tune.

Throw in the perpetual clamor
of impatient car horns and the
cheerful jingle that blares from city
dump‘ trucks, andiyou’ve got the
soundtrack of the summer for me
and my seven fellow participants
of .Pitt’s University Honors College
Mongolia Field Studies program.

Our summer-long adventure fea-
tures three weeks of travel in China

_ and Russia, followed by an intensive

Mongolian language crash course
and the opportunity to either intern
or conduct independent research
while in Mongolia. Also included in

the trip: plenty of authentic suuteii

tsai milk tea, access to patchy In-
ternet cafes and numerous photo
ops.

I hardly knew a thing about Mon-
golia prior toiapplying for the pro-
gram. I simply assumed it was one of

' those mythical places that double as

made—for-TV movie backdrops --

, kind of in the same camp as Anne

Hathaway’s pear-exporting Genovia
in “The Princess Diaries.”

But as fate and \X/ikipedia would
have it, Mongolia is a vibrant and
bustling country, albeit far less

touristy than neighboring Russia

or China. More than twice the size
of Texas, this newly democratic na-
tion is the birthplace of Genghis
Khan and the reason for "construc-
tion of the Great Wall of China.

In a country where more than half '

of the population lives a nomadic,
herding lifestyle in the countryside,
horses easily outnumber humans

13 to one.

Inspired by this landlocked gem’s
breathtaking landscapes and tradi-
tional script, I decided to venture out
of my Western comfort zone and
into this striking nation. I wanted
to trek in the Gobi Desert and scale
the snowcapped Altai Mountains. I
wanted to ride a came] on the ex-
pansive steppes, and I really wanted
to avoid another summer spent at
home, scooping ice cream for mini-
mum wage.

One 12-hour ﬂight, seven over-
night trains and a questionable
speedboat ride later, these plans leapt
closer to fruition as I ﬁnally arrived
in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of
Mongolia. I was ready to embark
on my search for worldliness, ac-
culturation and the perfect recipe for
khuushuur -——- traditional Mongolian
fried dumplings.

Ulaanbaatar, which translates as
“Red Hero,” is charming in a very
endearing sense. ‘

i As home to more than 1 million
people, it is the largest metropolis in
Mongolia, never mind that it requires

businessmen, Peace Corps volun-
teers and hordes of Australian 20-

locks, backpacks and ambitions to
see the world.

Amusinglyg this random assort-
ment of inhabitants is mirrored in
the city’s personality: slightly offbeat
and steeped in individuality.

The Soviet-style buildings are
adorned with pastel paint, weath-
ered and peeling from frequent sand-
storms, blazing sun and angry rain.

Even the cracking, faded pavement
and rusty metal playgrounds contrib-
ute to the cityfs unmistakable salmon,
mauve and seafoam palette.

Sidewalks tend to be a mis-
matched jumble of uneven bricks,
and gaping manholes protrude from
the ground as a daily obstacle course.
They provide a challenge to the hand-
ful of Americans ir1 flip-flops and the
droves of stiletto-clad Mongolian
women, but the sidewalks might be
a safer bet than the streets: Drivers
are inclined to ignore traffic lights

nonexistent.

from livestock to entire garbage bags

For one artist, it took a hurri-
cane to inspire clay couture.

While Lee Renninger’s experi-
ence with Hurricane Katrina in-
volved much loss and grief, along-
lasting effect of the incident is a
positive one —‘an art exhibit.

“Threaded Line,” a free exhibit
featuring Renninger’s ceramic art-
work, will appear in, Pittsburgh
longer than the Three Rivers Arts
Festival.

The exhibit is scheduled to re-
main in the 709 Penn Gallery from
June 5 to July 18, but Renninger’s
fashion-inspired ceramic pieces
were on display even earlier.

' Onjune 4, the Pittsburgh Cul-
tural Trust’s community engage-
ment department opened the small

Downtown gallery for a preview
of the exhibit. The event, called
“Cake, Couture & Chardonnay,”
conveyed the artist’s vision into a

t party, ushering the exhibit into its
six-week stay.

According to the gallery, more
than 100 people have visited the
show each day. . I . ,

“We’ve had lots of visitors‘ by
way of the Three Rivers Arts Festi-
val, and many people are intrigued

by the use of plates,” Veronica ,

Corpuz, public relations director

' for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust,
said. A

Janis Burley Wilson, the vice

president of education and com-

munity engagement of the Pitts- P

burgh Cultural Trust, approached
Renninger about bringing her re-
cent pieces to the city.

Lee uses clay and other materials

said.

A The exhibition features a hand-
ful of Renninger’s couture-themed
pieces. She uses ceramics to imitate
the appearance of fabric.

“Art is like anything else. It has
its own boundaries and constructs.
In order to break through and
create something new, one has to
question the existing paradigms of

‘ concept, materials, methods, etc.,”

Renninger said in an e-mail.‘
“Ceramic material isinherently

it for utility. The transformation of

and ﬂuid, as well as visually weight-

“It was my one bright spot in each dark

A “After doing all that I could at the home

“Lee’s work is representative of the qual-
ity and diversity of artists that we seek to
bring to the cultural district,” Corpuz said.

She said the show hasvbeen received “very”

_ well” and that visitors at the gallery grow
quite involved in Renninger’s work.

Mimi Ngokion visited the show Satur-
day, the last day of the arts festival. Walking
toward Point State Park, Ngokion stopped
into the gallery on Penn Avenue.

“I didn’t know [the exhibit] was here,
but it’s great,” Ngokion said. “I’m kind of
shocked. [It’s] strange but beautiful. I can
tell it’s clayg but I want to‘ wear it.”

Even though visitors like Ngokion aplgp

preciate the strange beauty of Renninger’s 

work, the artist has heard a recycled criticism
of “Threaded Line.”

Whﬂe Renninger’s work explores “con-
cepts of personal and political, as well as eth-
nic and group, identity,” she said shelaughs
when she’s told her work is too feminine.

“A man wouldnever, and I mean never,

After posting a 5-6-2 record in the Big East last year, newly returned
assistant coach Chris Karwoski hopes to reignite the program. '

by Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team pulled
its new assistant coach directly from
the history books.

Chris Karwoski, a former Pitt
assistant from 1993-97, rejoins the
Pitt staff after spending 11 years
as Western Michigan University’s

) head coach. At Pitt, Karwoski and

Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher guided
the Panthers to anaverage of 10
wins per season, includinga No. 22
ranking and a school—best 14 wins
in 1995. t ‘

“It’s a big plus for our_pro-
gram. He is a good man and a very
good coach,” Luxbacher said. “We
worked together, we have similar
philosophies and we had a great
time. We had a lot of success when
he was here before, so I’m looking
forward to it.”

Karwoski said he always loved
the area and is excited to return
to the city of Pittsburgh. He said

orme coach returns to Pitt

he had a great experience when he
coached at Pitt previously and he
feels happy to have another oppor-
tunity to work with Pitt’s athletic
department.

“On a personal level, I’m very
happy and excited to be able to re-
turn to joe and the men’s team,”
Karwoski said. “It’s just a great place,
and I’ve known that all along. On
a coaching and professional level,
it’s a great opportunity. I know I
can help Joe and players in a lot
of different ways, from training to
recruiting to scouting to just general
life enhancement for the guys on
the team.”

Karwoski said Luxbacher and
the team have a better chance of
being successful with an assistant
coach who can help the team from
a head coach’s perspective. He said
he could strengthen aspects of the
team that were weak last season,
while Luxbacher and he work to

develop the Panthers into a Big East

Sedon, Reed

by Adam Littrnan
and Jay Huerbin
Sparta E3[to/'4

A Heading into the last week of i
the season, the Pitt baseball team

needed to win two of three games
against West Virginia to make its
first Big East tournament since
2007.

Led by second baseman Chris

Sedon and starting pitcher Nate.

Reed, the Panthers won the first
two games of the series, and the
two players were selected for the
Big East honor roll that week.

The two juniors are linked once
again, this time as the only two cur-
rent Panthers selected in_ last week’s
MLB Draft. H

Sedon was picked in the 10th
round (300th overall) by the Detroit

‘Tigers, and Reed was drafted by

the Chicago White Sox in the 20th
round (613th overall). While both
said they felt happy to" get drafted,
neither is sure if he plans on skip-

ping his senior season at Pitt to ‘
go play in the minor leagues. They
have until mid-August to decide.

   

Chris Sedon

“There is a long list of our play-
ers that have gone on to play pro-
fessionally,” Pitt coach Joe Jordano

told pittsburghpanthers.com. “In
addition to the draft picks, there are
nearly 30 players that have signed
to play professional baseball,” he
said. “I am certain we will continue
that trend.” .

In his first year after transferring
from Lackawanna Community Col-

lege, Sedon set Pitt’s single-season

records for home runs (22), total
bases (160) and runs scored (65).
He also led the team in batting
average (.398), RBIs (62) and hits
(80).

Sedon has collected numerous
honors since the season ended;

- He’s been named to the Big East

All-American first team, Louisville
Slugger All-American ﬁrst team
and Baseball America’s All-Amer-
ican second team.

While Sedon had a career year,
Reed felt he underperformed this
season. As the Panthers’ number
one starting pitcher, Reed went 4-6
with a 6.21 ERA. He started 13
games, pitching 84 innings, giving

selected in 2009 MLB Draft

up 113 hits while striking out 60
batters and walking 32. '

“I could have had a better year,”
Reed said, “but I can’t say [my sea-
son] was a complete failure.”

Reed is a left-handed pitcher
who throws a fastball, curveball
and change-up. He said his fast-
ball, which reaches the low 90s, and
change-up are his best pitches.

While hesaid he’s dreamed of
playing in the major leagues since
he was a kid, Reed said he wants to
complete his degree in communi-
cation. He also said he thinks the
team will improve next year.

“The. pitching staff was young
this year, and it was our first year
with our new pitching coach [Bran-
don Rowan] ,” Reed said. “We have
a chance to be really good next
year.” _

Also taken was Royce Consigli,
an incoming freshman from On-
tario, who went in the 30th round

.(903rd overall) to the Oakland

Athletics.

The track season ﬁnally ended
for senior Mycaiah Clemons this
past weekend at the NCAA Cham-
pionships in Fayetteville, Ark. _

Clemons ﬁnished sixth in the i
first heat of the preliminary round
in the 100—meter hurdles with a
time of 13.99 seconds, but failed
to qualify for the semiﬁnal round.
Seven runners competed in each
heat, and the top three advanced.

“It wasn’t her best,” head coach
Alonzo Webb said. “Had she run
what she was capable of, she prob-
ably would have made the ﬁnal.”

This was her first career apart

pearance at nationals, and Webb
said he thought the added pressure
affected her running.

Yet, despite not advancing at
nationals, Clemons’ career at Pitt
was extremely productive. 45

After transferring from Virgin-

season and not competing much

earned all-Big East honors her ju-

top runners, Webb said he thought

Another championship

parade ends memorable year

if ughfn Wallace / Photoitor

Penguins defenseman Brooks Orpik celebrates with fans during Monday's Stanley Cup
victory parade in Downtown. The Stanley Cup is the first for the franchise since 1992.

by Greg Trietley
Staﬂ H7/'[ter

The city of Pittsburgh has another cham-

pion.

Just months after the Steelers sent Pittsbur— A

ghers into the streets in celebration, the South
Side reveled in victory once  as the Penguins
knocked off the Detroit Red Wings 2-1 in Game
7 of the Stanley Cup Finals

The victoryis the Penguins’ first championship
since 1992, and the first for the team’s dynamic
duo of Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby.

Malkin played in the playoffs as a man pos-
sessed. The Russian center led all postseason
scorers with 36 points —— eight of those in the

'ﬁnals——onhiswaytowinnjngtheConnSmythc

Trophy as the playoffs’ most valuable player.
Criticism of Malkin’s lack of postseason pas-
sion forever’ ended with his play this year. He bit,
set up his lincmates, buried his chances and led
the Penguins, even in losses
And while Malkin was the most valuable Pen-

guin in the playoffs, the hero of Game 7 was
linematc Max Talbot The young forward, who
played on the fourth line at times this season,
scored both Pittsburgh goals Friday night: The
Red Wings shut down Crosby, as he had just
three points in the ﬁnals, but Talbot stepped up
in his place

Once Talbot gave Pittsburgh the lead, goal-
tender Marc—Andre Fleury denied Detroit the op-
portunity to win. Fleury played some of his best
hockey of the seasonin Games 6 and 7, stopping
48 of 50 Red Wing shots A  memory of
the championship run will be his gamc—saving,
point-blank stop on Nicklas Lidstrom with time
running out for Detroit , .

Fleury purged a rocky Game 5 loss from his
memory and came back calm and composed for
the Penguins’ win-or—go-home games Indeed,
things appeared dreary for Pittsburgh after Detroit
shellacked the Penguins 5-0 to go up in the series
3-2. The Red Wtngs looked primed to win their

. second consecutive Cup over Pittsburgh, but a

few  went wrong for them.

“The Big East is probably the
top conference in the nation from

“The competition is outstanding
and the opportunities for the team

The Panthers ﬁnished the 2008
season with 7-8-3 overall record and
went 3-6-2 in the Big East. They
qualified for the Big East tourna-
ment, but fell to DePaul 3-1 in the
first round.

Karwoski’s Division I head-

the team, Luxbacher said, because
Karwoski knows how to perform
as a head coach, as well as an as-

Penguins overcome injuries, Hossa to net Cup victory

City of Champions, page 14
Overlooked in the first three rounds, The Red
,\Wings’ struggles on the road in the postseason
caught up with them. Detroit ﬁnished just 4-6
away from home in the playoffs, and that record
bit the team in Game 6 when it had the chance to
win the Cup in Pittsburgh. The Penguins ended
Detroit’s party, winning 2-1, and rode the mo-

~ ementum into Game 7.

Marian Hossa, who potted 40 goals in the
regular season, went scoreless against Pittsburgh,
his former team. His bad play couldn’t have come
at a worse time: Henrik Zetterberg keyed defen-

sively on Crosby, and Pavel Datsyuk missed four
games with a foot  In addition, the spotlight
was already on him because of his decision to
leave Pittsburgh for Detroit in the offseason. T

Datsyuk’s return from his injury in Game 5
sparked the Red  to their dominatingwin,
but the Hart Trophy ﬁnalist wasn’t a major factor
in the final two games of the series. Were he not
in Cup-clinching games, his injury might have
kept him from playing.

And Datsyuk wasn’t the only  Detroit
player. Though no Red Wing used his injury as

an excuse, after hearing the laundry list of the
injuries, it’s no wonder some players slumped.
Lidstrom, arguably the best defenseman of this
decade, revealed he missed two games against
Chicago because of surgery on his testicle after
being speared by Patrick Sharp. Defenseman
Brian Rafalski, who tallied 12 points in the play-
offs, suffered both a separated shoulder and a
ruptured disk in his back.

On Pittsburgh’s team, the undisclosed right
knee injury defenseman Sergei Gonchar suffered
in a collision with Washington’s Alex Ovechkin

she had’ an immediate impact on the team in
areas unrelated to her performance.

“She’s been a very good teammate and I

was willing to go above and beyond and
stepped up and did anything that she was
asked to,” he said. '

Clemons showed this through her versa-
tility. While at Pitt, she competed in several
events, including the 4—by-10—meter relay,
4—by—400—meter relay, 100—meter hurdles and
400—meter hurdles.

“She actually qualiﬁed for regionals in the
400-meter hurdles, as wellas the 100—meter
hurdles,” Webb said. “We just chose not to
have her run in the 400.”

, While Clemons’ successful collegiate ca-

reer has ended, Webb said he thinks she has
the tools to make it professionally.

“She’s learned what it takes to make it
to the next level,” he said. “If she wanted
to pursue that, I think she would do Very

well.”
