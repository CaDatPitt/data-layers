Ronald Pease had talked with Dr.
in, vice chancellor of Student Affairs, and that
Dr. Rankin had an understanding and somewhat
sympathetic attitude toward serving alcohol on

campus.

Adams said that the movementﬁ

and discussion must be made stu-
dent-wide before any steps could
be taken to bring this issue before
the Board of Trustees of the Uni-
versity.

In other— business, the Senate
elected George Mostoller to fill
the vacant Engineering and Mines
seat. Mostoller is a junior who

Local Nero Paper

Sees Discrimination

The Pittsburgh Courier, a nationally affiliated Negro
weekly, has challenged the University to prove that it does
not discriminate against Negro football players in recruit-

ment policies.

In an article in last week’s edition, the Courier pointed
out that in the past ﬁve years no Negro has appeared in the
Panther line-up. Under the headg‘ .

line “Does Pitt Consider Negro‘,
Grid Stars ‘Out-of Bounds‘ for‘
Its ‘Lilly-white’ Team?” The
Courier stated, “. . . ofﬁcials of‘
the University must prove to Ne—l
groes that the facts are other thanl
what they appear to be." .

These facts, according to The;
Courier, have placed the Univer—';
sity “in almost the same unenvi-ii
able category as that suffered by.
the Washington Redskins“
eyes of many Negroes.

“In short . . . Negro football
lovers go out of their way to
express satisfaction when the
‘lilly-white‘ gridders of the
school bite the dust in defeat.
To these people, it would make
no difference if Pitt never won
a football game.”

The Courier asked for the an-
swer on policy which it says has
created this situation. “Negro
wrath against the school doesn’t
begin and end with Coach John
Michelosen. They feel that Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld who sets the
over—all policy for the educational
institution, must clear his skirts.

“They insist that Frank Carver,
the school’s athletic director, who

ing a ‘fair-minded man’ must
come forth withla positive state-
ment of policy.”

As the official spokesman for
the absent Chancellor and Mr.

Cholesterol  

Study Revealed
By Scientists

Dr. Campbell Moses Jr., director
of t.he Addison H. ‘Gibson Lab-
oratory. at the University School
of Medicine, announced that.re-
search scientists have been able
to reduce the cholesterol content
in the blood of volunteers with

‘ hormone therapy.

Mos-es made his report October
15 at the 15th annual meeting of

‘ the American Society for the
- Study of Arteriosclerosis in Miami

Beach, Florida. He headed the
deus S. Danowski, head of the
Univcrsity‘s Division of Endocri-
nology and Metabolism.

In the study, 84 healthy inmates
from the State Correctional Insti-
tution in Pittsburgh participated
 volunteers. Each man was
given hundreds of pills and tapped
for blood samples at least 120
times.

The research covered three
areas: the function of the thyroid
in relation to aging, the use of
hydrocortisone in reducing cho-
lesterol content in the blood, and
tests combining both phases of the
research.

Conclusions were that a de-
crease in adrenal and thyroid
function is one of the factors con-
tributing to increased cholesterol,
that in some cases, the body cor-
rects the decreased" output of

cholesterol level.

The research. was sponsored by
grants from the John A. Hart-
ford Foundationk Inc., the US.
Public Health Service, and the

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

THE DATING SEASON

I have recently returned from 2. tour of tl.'it),(l(,i(l Aziiei-icon col-
leges where I made a survey of l1l1(l(‘l‘gl"cl«(lll2il»P clat.ing custmns
and sold mechanical dogs, and I l'l:t\’C tuluilate<l my lindingzs
and I am now prepared to tell you the simple secret; of s1ic(:os.<l ul
dating.

The simple secret is simply this: a date is siu~ces<sl'ul when. the
man knows how to treat. the girl.

And how does a girl like to be treat.e<l'? if you want to know,
read and rcmeinber these four canlina.l rules of dating:

1. A girl liilaxes to be frrmied ’Il“Il/ll re.s,m2.¢~!.

VVhen you call for, your girl, do not drive up in front. of the
sorority house and yell, “Hey, l:-it lady!” that out of your car.
Wlalk respectfully to the door. Knock respe<:tul'ully. When your
girl comes out, tug your forelock and say respectl'ull_v, “(loud
evening, your honor.” Then otler her a Marlboro, for what.
greater respect can you show your girl llliill to offer l\larllooro
with its ﬁne ﬂavor and exclusive selecstmlxe liltm? it will in—
dicate immediately tliat you respect. her t.u..sl'c, respect her dis-
cernment», respect her intelligence. So, good liuddies, before
going out on 2. date, always renieinber to buy sonic l\l:u'lboros,
available in soft pack or flip-top box in all .30 of the United
States and also Cleveland.

    

2. A girl lilces a good lv'.sf.exn.er.

Do not monopolize the conversation. Let her talk while you
listen a.tt.ent1vely. Make sure, however, that she is not herself
argood listener.’ I recollect a date I had once with a coed named
Greensleeves bigafoos, a lovely girl, but unfortuna tel y a listener,
not a. talker.’ I too was a. listener so We Just sat, all night long,
each with his hand cupped over his ear, straining to catch a.
word, not talking hour after hour until finally a policeman came’
by and a~l‘1‘est»_ed us both for va,gra.nc_v. -I did a year and a day.
She got by with a. suspended sentence because she was the sole
support of her aged housemother.

3- A Fitz ltilros to be taken to nice places.

By “nice” places I do not mean expensive places. A girl does
not demand luxury. All she asks is a. place that is ple-as:mt and
gracious. The Tomb of the llnknown Soldier, for example. Or
1Vil(C;I1§l1‘r= Rusli11i()1}‘:_. Or the Ta_i Malial. Or the Bureau of Weight-s.
an . easiires. ind places like these to take your girl. In no

, Last week The Pittsburgh Courier, a local Negro weekly,
strongly suggestedthat the University practices racial dis-
crimination in its football recruiting program. “Wh.y,” the
headline asks, “Can’t lnept Pitt Find Tan Gridders?” A
question closer at hand is why, if Pitt is going to practice
discrimination at all, should it limit itself to the gradiron?

By i.ts own volition,.the crusadingpaper pointed ou.t that
Negroes h.ave captained Pitt’s track team and made out-
standing contributions in the round ball sport. In addition
to Julius Pegues, the school’s ﬁrst Negro varsity basketball
player, the rebels can cite Ben Jinx, who gained All-State
honorable mention in basketball last year and all-time great
Arnie Sowell. . —

Yet» in the light of these facts, The.C0uri.er states that
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, “who sets the over-all pol-
icy for the educational institution, must clear his skirts.”

But which part. of the robe is dragging? H the “overall,

policy” of the University i.s questionable then on what basis

does The Courier account for the above—mentioned stars?

Or how does it answer the University’s dormitory integra-
tion where‘ all colors and nationalities live together, often
in the same room? From these observations, all signs seem
to point to an “over—all” policy of desegregation.

As for the, athletic department, head football coach John
Michelosen, the man directly involved, stated his facts in
the Sugar Bowl controversy when he categorically an-
nounced that either Bobbie Grier went to the bowl with the
Panthers or nobody went. In a recent interview he said,
“We recruti with a radius of 750 miles and we have fou_n.d,
most of the stars (Negro and white) can’t qualify‘ academ-
ically. Out of the WPIAL’s all star team, only two of the 11
were eligible.” .

But, The Courier continues, “if Negro athletes can play
football and PASS in the Big Ten, Ivy League, the Paciﬁc
Coast Conference and other schools, certainly SOME NE-

‘ GRO is capable of meeting‘ the academic standards at Pitt.”

Maybe so, but is he the boy who wants to go to Pitt?
It’s a known fact that other universities, by whatever means,
can and often do make more attractive offers both scholas-

Vtically and athletically. ‘In the past few years Pitt has not
only been faced with" this competition on the playing ﬁeld

but in the classrooms as well. .

But if The Courier is so concerned with discrimination
on the Pitt football team then why when it was approached
to help recruit Negro players did it admittedly turn. its
back, and in what way will it help by condemning the very
institution in which it so badly wishes to be represented?

/(ration committed to an im.aginati.ve reappraisal of

Trading K For K . . . _

By John Lowonthol

, 1 don’t know about you people, but I’m lust
plain disgusted with the h0P€1eS5 muddlingp during
the last ten years by East-West disarmament con-
ferees. Everybody knows how the system works.
With great fanfare and ceremony Arthur Deane
meets in Geneva with Semyon » V
Tserapkin. The meeting is hailed
around the world as a “great
stride toward universal bliss.
The delegates: then assemble,
express their complete distrust
of one another, and that is the
end of disarmament for a
while. _

Now most of us, except, of
course, for the lunatic right, are
convinced that an effective dis-
armament program is absolute-
l.y essential -to the survival of mankind. Further,
there is atthe moment in ‘Washington an adminis-

 

foreign policy. \

Unfortunately, both the imagination and the
reappraisal have been, to speak ‘kindly, timid and
moderate. Surely by now the timehas come for a
really bold, decisive action, with an excellent
chance of success.

Simple Action .

This action I proposeis really quite simple: for
a period of, say, six ’m.on.ths, President Kennedy
and ‘Premier Khrushchev should simply exchange
jobs. Then we willget real action and disarma-
ment. Why? Because both men would have just

Super—Exchange Plan

would be exceedingly ditﬁcult to achieve. Actug.
the machinery for this step already exists: the.Cu},,
tural Exchange Program. It is doubtless true
Khrushchev doesn"t dance as well as Ulanova of», my
Bolshoi, or play theviolin with Oistrakh, but 
bright wavy-haired lawyer in the Justice 
ment should be able to solve this problem.

Since all legal-political objections to the.prggi
dential exchange are easily surmounted,  i
have seen, let ‘us speculate for a moment on w ..
might happen during the period of exchange. 1?
Kennedy, coming off a tough session with Con
gress, marked by heartstopping victories’ andha-jg
breadth defeats, it would probably be quite,a”1-
lief to work with the nice tractable men of. eh;
Politburo who only know how to say “Da” to the‘.
leader. For Khrushchev in the United States,’ _
would be quite a different sort of experience. Wh 
he realizes that Congress is not the Politbui-9
will doubtless attempt a purge, only to ﬁnd that —
death sentences have been" invalidated by n
spoilsports on the Supreme Court. A photo lofh
expression at this moment would easily be worth
whatever disagreeable things were happening» in
the country at the time. i 
‘Changing Partners

The general foreign policies of the two countries
during this period should show ‘somechange. The :
Soviet Union will apply for a placeliln NATO and-
the U. S. for admittance to the Warsaw Pact. Ger- it
many, as usual, will,be caught in the middle, but
since neither side would have the capacity to start '
a ﬁght about it the situation should not be too seri.

   
 

six months in otﬁce to weaken and obliterate the
striking power of the other country. Let me tell
you, the pace will be frantic. At the end of six
months it would be truly surprising if anything
more potent than a cap gun was left in either the
»United States or the Soviet Union. And let us si-
lence right here the cries that in thisicase Ghana
will then conquer the world. This fear is ground-
less, because Ghana has not yet developed its first
cap gun (CIA says that Nkrumah is hard at work,

though.)

It would seem that a step such as this would re-
quire endless preparation, and that a culmination

  
   
   
   
  
   
  
    
  
 
 
  
 
 
 

ous. In the U.N. Mr. Stevenson will call for an in- ’
vestigation of the Cuban invasion while Zorin will a
request international relief for Hungary. 
The big question is what will happen to the
way of life here and in Russia. Will America be- a
come communized and Russia capitalized? No, sug-A "

Both K. and K will remain politicians to the end,
and as politicians will adapt, like the chamelon, to
the new environment. In six months Kennedy will

be a dedicated Communist and Khrushchev a dedi-

cated Western Liberal. Neither will return to his .
country, and the arms race will begin anew.

Quest For New

Last week a letter was printed

three years has been struggling
for recognition in a growing aca-

Reacler Says Student

Voice Just Whispers
Tlw Pill L

In the column. “’I‘hc Choice is
Yours.” I believe that Mr. Nel-
son has completely missed the
entire concept of respor1sib.ili£;v
pertaining to the student voice.

Editor. N(’ll?.,\',

In seemingly soap-box man-

ner. Mr. Nelson has passed 
the inadequacy of The Pitt
News. as the voice of the stu-

dent body, to the student body
at large.

It is the duty and the re-
sponsibility of a school news-
paper to be the leading student
force and voice on campus. Why
must The Pitt News act just as
a polling committee on student
opinion‘? Isn't this newspaper
permitted to express definitive.
editorial views on a subject?

Mr. Nelson, may I ask you: Is
the University Health Service
incompetent or inadequate? Will
The Pitt News ﬁnd out and try
to do something about it if
needed‘? What is the editorial
boards opinion, as a student
force, on the allowance or dis-
allowance of alcohol on campus‘?

When an editorial is written
that might go against the ad-
ministration views it always
seem to include an apology or
have a pacifistic attitude. Re-
member you are the voice of
the student body. It is true the
administration need not look at
what an individual student li-as
to'say, but it can not help but
listen to what the voice of the
student body says.

Editor. The Pitt News,

Re: That great labor—saving
device of the University pro-
fessor known as the “m:.u'l<or.”

For those who do not know,
or have only been subliminally
aware, the marker is that in-
tense graduate student. only a
year or two out of college him-
self, to whom the undergraduate
student owes his grade.

Although it may be stim-
ulating to take a course from an

expert instructor, it is horrifying 7

when you realim that getting
into g,radu;.llc school depends on
the marks given not by the in-

structor (the person teaching
the course’) but by a handy,

work.-saving graduate student.
The only conclusion at which
I can arrive is that some in-
structors do not respect the stu-
dent enough to judge‘ for him-
self the studcnt’s level of at-

tainment. They must reason

Review of ‘The Empty Canvas’ .

M.oraVia’s New Novel

Seen As Major Work it

By MATTHEW NESVISKY '

Alberto Moravia’s The Empty Canvas (Farrar, Straus
and Cudahy; 306 pp.; $4.50; translated by Angus Davidson),
is the latest in a series of major Italian no\>e15 to -reach this
country since the end of the-‘war.

The book, which is to be released within a matter of
days, is one of the best products of both Italy and of the

author in a long, literary while}

Dino, the first-person narrator,
is the only son and heir to an
ancient, lire-drenched estate, but
he rejects his mother’s villa and
chooses to live alone in poverty.
This is no noble act; Dino is
merely bored to hell and back.
The sad fact is that he no longer
has any feeling for the external
world. _

He has tried painting as an
escape-route from this boredom
but, after ten years, he sees that

the has failed ‘completely. An
empty canvas symbolically
stands on its easel, reflecting

only Dino’s colorless existence.
With straight, crisp exposition,
Moravia depicts the sterile paint-

Aer’s strange state; he is calml.y

neurotic, blandly bitter and he
withers without shriveling.

And, when Dino meets Cecilia,
he still does not change. The sev-
enteen-year-old had been spend-
ing the last ‘two years as the
model/mistress of an aged paint-
er in.Dino’s- building. _

After her keeper dies, Cecilia
drifts down the hall and into the
open but inanimate arms of the
relatively attractive young auto-
maton, Dino. Their meeting re-
sults in a lengthy, loveless and
mechanical affair.

Moravia’s clear, exact prose
becomes almost frighteningly

' More to it Than That
However, there was more to it
than just the musical composi-
tions. It took no training, for in-
stance, to appreciate the grins of
mutual satisfaction and congrat-
ulations that were exchanged by
Mr. Shankar and his drummer,
Kanai Dutta, following what
could only have been virtuosi
passages. .

One could also observe, dur-
ing these diﬁicult passages, Mr.
Sha.nkar’s toes wiggling furi-
ously and straining to keep up
with the intricacies of the raga.

Although the casual observer
might be tempted to describe the
sitar as a sort of double-barrelled
guitar, closer inspection reveals it
to be quite a bit more sophisti-
cated than most Western stringed
 instruments, perhaps even includ-

ing the violin.
The sitar has 21 total of nearly

30 strings and six or seven of

these can be played horizontally‘

as well as vertically. In addition,

the sitar seems to require, for a

proper performance, another in- _

strument, called the tamboura, , _

‘. . . A Difficult Barrier’

nday, October 23. 1561

Professor Accuses Real Estate
‘Racism For Profit’

Brokers of

Jack Rothman, Professor
in the Community VVorl< Pro-
gram of the University’s
Graduate School of Social
work, has called the real es-
tate brokers who use racism

for proﬁt a difficult barrier in the
attempt to set up integrated com-
munities.

In a report which appeared in

the recent issue of “The Nation”
Dr. Rothman called such brokers

“The Ghetto Makers.” '
“While choked for space in de-
pressed slum areas, Negroes are
rigorously restricted in the hous-
ing market, with almost no new
housing being constructed to meet
their needs," he said. ’

‘‘At the same time, their econ-
omic position is rising signiﬁcantly
and their attitudes are increasingly
inﬂuenced by the middle-class val-
ues which pervade our society.

Most Channels Blocked

“It: is no wonder that as a par-
ticular area of the city opens up
for non-while occupancy, the Ne-
gro market will ﬂow in that di-
rection, all other channels being
blocked.“ -

Because of white prejudice,
however, “no sooner does the
first Negro family move into a
white area than large numbers

A“ of Whites move out.” he said.

Rothman, who studied these
problems in a middle-class resi-
dential community in the Borough
of Queens, alleged that certain real
estate brokers “consciously trigger
these personal predispositions and
channel them into large-scale

’ movements.”

Panic Residents
“By panicking home owners, the
broker can pocket an even greater
return by entering the market he

is manipulating, buying low and%

selling high, in addition to mak-
ing a commission on every sale.”
“The block-busters are the
most deliberately destructive.
Once a Negro somehow manages
to move into a white neighbor-
hood. these brokers make their
entrance.” ’
“Through house-to-house can-
vassing, relentless telephone so-
licitations, use of the mails and by
various other means, they create
an atmosphere oi’ panic in‘ the
neighborhood and hi.gh-pressure
the white residents into selling.
“ ‘Do you want your kids to play
with colored kids?’ goes their sales
talk. ‘Do you want to be the last

C hess Tolirziey‘

Set Tomorrow

The Chess Club will hold its
first 10-second tournament tomor-
row at: 7 pm. in the room behind
the Pine Room on the ground floor
of the Student Union.

“Each player is allowed ten
seconds per move, so it should be
exciting. All chess players are
urged to participate. and sp€C‘€3~
tors are welcome!" said Jay
Iskowitz, president.

A trophy will be given to the
winner of this speed tournament.

white family left. on the block‘? Do
you want to lose a fortune on your
house?’ ”

Offer Cash

Characteristically, they approach
ahome owner with a cash offer
and the (often fallacious) news
that Mrs. Jones down the street is
selling to a Negro family.

Occasionally, ‘decoys,’ such as
Negro woman wheeling a baby
carriage, are paraded up and.
down the street to set the proper
psychological climate.”

The agents who refuse to list or
show properties in integrated
neighborhoods to white clients and
who will not Show property in
predominantly white areas to non-
white buyers are termed “lily-
whiters.”

Banks Take Part
I “Banks and lending institutions
also play their unsavory part in

this operation” by making it hard
for Negroes to obtain mortgages on
homes purchased in white areas
and by refusing applications of
whites trying to buy in integrated
or changing sections.

“Ghetto Makers” also quote
unrealistically _low prices to
prospective Negro buyers. .When
the buyer comes to the realty
office and ﬁnds that the listed
property is non—existent, he is
talked into buying a more ex-
pensive one.

“Frequently, Negroes are urged
to take in boarders or otherwise
overcrowd the property in order
to pay‘ for it. This deteriorates the
neighborhood and makes the for-'
mation of totally Negro middle-
class communities impossible.”

The Community Work Program

at the University is a two year

course leading to a master’s de-
gree.

This is the end?

Coach Johnny Michelosen
finally settled on one quarter-
back as “his choice” in Satur-
day's 20-6 loss to UCLA, as
.Jim Traﬁcant, the Youngs-
town signal—caller called all the
eflensixre signals inthe fourth loss
of the season.

Traﬁcant threw more passes
around the Co-V
liseum than an
overly~generous
publicity man
would, complet-
ing 12 out of 25
attempts, which
isn"t bad. _ The
only trouble is
th a t three of
' those c om ple-

t i o n s we r e
caught by such

Trallficant,
jpersons as Carmen DiPoalo, Bob

Smith and Mel Proﬁt. If you’re
familiar with the Pitt lineup,
you’ll realize that these were in-«
terceptions.

Lost in Shame-

ILJCLA’ capitalized on these 
takes to bury the Cats. So now
the proletariat of the Pittsburgh.
area has a new cry. After bela-

‘1’c>oring; the fact that Michelosen

had been shuffling his trio of
“specialized” quarterbacks like a
nervous croupier at a gaming ta»
‘bite in the four previous games,
now they’re screaming, “Where
was (Paul) Martha? What hap-
pened to that (Sam) Colella kid?”
Well, last; week, A! Abrams of
the Post-Gazette suggested in
his column that Ma.rtha should
be shifted to halfback and the
“wilkinsburg whiz—Kio” saw a
paltry bit of action at that posi-A
tion, and Colella was in sym-
pathy withsevery telephone op-
erator in the country, as his ear
was on the instrument all day,
digesting information from the
scouts up in the stratosphere of
the Coliseum press box.

Twenty sophomores saw action
under the California sun and some
of them turned in creditable per-
formances. Rick Leeson, Jeff Ware
and Ray Popp were playing havoc
with the Bruin ballcarriers on de~
tense, and John Telesky, Pete Bil-

ley and John Ozimel; sparked
awhile on offense.
ll/Iichelosen‘ thought that the

Bruin’s superior size hurt the
passing atack a lot. “It’s mighty
hard to pass over those seven foot
0115153 he said.

“Traﬁcant has thrown better,
but I thought he tried real hard
today. This is the first time he’s
been under fire this year (dis-r
counting the Baylor, Washington
and West. Virginia games) and he
may have been a bit rusty.”

Bobby Crier In Georgia

‘While governors and legislatures of the South
have fought tooth and nail against integration of
schools, transportation facilities and at the social
level, the athletic integration has taken place grad-
ually. within certain limitations and, except in the
rarest of instances. without igniting the ﬂame of
antagonism. ,

One of the‘ rarest occurred in November of
1955 when Georgia Tech accepted an invitation to
meet the University of Pittsburgh in the Sugar
Bowl football game. A few days later a group in
Augusta, Georgia, identifying themselves as the
States’ Rights Council. Inc.. wired Governor Mar-
vin Griffin and demanded that Tech not be allowed
to fill the date. ' 4“

There were two reasons: (1) Pittsburgh had
a Negro player, a reserve fullback named Bob
Grier of Masillon, Ohio, and (2) for the first
time in its 22 years the Sugar Bowl was selling
tickets to Negro spectators, some on a non—seg're-
gation basis.

This fell in line with Governor Gritﬁn’s plotted

system in Georgia, torefuse Tech the permission to.

fill the Sugar Bowl date.

Immediately, Georgia’s worst proﬁle was turn-
ed to the nation. The state and the administration
became the subject of humiliating ridicule. Grifﬁn
apparently became remorseful himself. not for his
stand but for the ‘reaction it created. This, of
course, was a private emotion. Publicly, he stood
strong and ﬁrm, though he tolerated without Vin-
dicativeness a demonstration of 2,000 aroused Tech
students and a similar sympathetic gesture by a
smaller band of students from the traditionally
bitter rival University of Georgia. A ,

Griﬁin made a behind-the-curtain appeal to
some members of the Board of Regents to get
him oﬁ the hook. They did. They approved the
game over his head.

Tech played against Pitt and Grier, the day’s
leading ground gainer in the absence of injured
fullback Tom Jenkins, and won as spectacular a
7—0 game as there ever has been.

Attitude Hurts Thin-Clads,

Coach Rees Says of Runners

Mental Attlitutle .’:‘

Poor At Meets

By BOB SMIZIK

The University of Pitts-
burgh is a big time school as
far as college athletics are
concerned. Our football team
plays, a schedule comprised
of the best teams in the coun-
try. Our wrestling squad is per-
ennially among the nation’s finest.
In almost every sport Pitt makes
a representative showing against
the other top schools.

One glaring exception is the
cross country team that has failed
to win against the likes Of 0hi0
Univer.<‘ity and Slippery Rock.

Coach Carl Rees feels the words
of sophomore runner Larry Robin-
son answers the woes that plague
the team. Robinson, the coaches
feel, has the ability of the squad’s
number one man Steve Waslo, but
consistently ﬁnishes behind Waslo.

Fred Mazurek, a quarterback
who is built like a guard and
runs like a halfback, proved to the
Freshmen of West Virginia that

I. all the fired up emotions in the
world will not win out over abil-
ity, as he led the Pitt Frosh to a
29-14 triumph of West Virginia
on Friday at the Stadium.

A riled up band of Moun-
taineers tried to duplicate the feat
that their varsity performed re-
cently against the Panther varsity.
Their zestfulness proved success-
ful in the first quarter as they
thoroughly outplayed the Cubs to
assume a 6-0 lead.

Midway through the second
stanza Mazurek went to work.

X After picking up 15 yards on a

roll-out, the quarterback appear-
ed to be trapped in his backﬁeld
on the following play. He squirm-
ed out of the arms of four rush-
ers, eduded another bevy of

would-be tacklers on the 20 yard’

line and raced unmolested into
the end zone fora 29 yard touch-
down.

Mazurek took the second half
kickoff on his five yard line and
raced up the sideline forlanother
score.

They Got Star

After Mazurek was hurt in the
third czmto the Mountaineers
came back to close the gap to
15-14.

Frank Novak, the alternate
quarterback, took over where
Mazurek left oﬁ’. Ron Robson
returned a short kickoff 29
yards to the visitors’ 41. From
here Novak hit Robson and
Nick Warrino with passes and
Bernie LaQuinta blasted out
clutch yardage up the middle to
put the Cubs on the 12 yard
stripe. Novak found Bill How-
ley on one knee in the end zone
and the Frosh had another
score.

Novak also sparked the ﬁnal
Cub tally. He intercepted a West
Virginia pass on his own 31 and
raced 36 yards to the Mounties
33. With Bill Beck, Tom Abele

A and Warrino doing the ball carry-

 

‘ ing the Cub’s moved to the tour

where Novak hit Jack Mechas for
a touchdown.

'I‘hetriumph gave the Cubs a
2-0 record while the West Vir-
ginians now have a 2-1 card.

Frosh Harriers
Down Jeannette

Coach Jim Banner’s freshmen
cross-country‘ team won its sec-
ond meet in three starts as it de-
feated a crew of also-rans who
also run, known collectively as
the Jeannette Harriers, 17-14, on
the Schenley course on Saturday.

Ralph Bazinski, who prepped on
the same hills while competing
for Central High on Fifth Ave-
nue, toured the ol’ familiar
places in the winning time of
14.10, closely followed by Gary
Burns, (14:13), Ray Mclntosh
(14.23), and John Perozelli
(14:26), all Pitt runners.

A fellow named Pat. Mooney
squeezed in fifth to account for
the Harriers’ scoring.

just runs.”
Too Much Thinking

Rees interprets this to mean,
“the boys show great ability in
practice but have trouble getting
themselves mentally up for‘a race.
They think too much."

The mentor feels thebig prob-
lem with the boys is their dc-
sire to hold everything back for
the ﬁnish.

“They start out slowly and save
their energy for the finish. By the

time the race is over they realize
they have too much left over and
should have run harder for a
longer stretch.”
Only A Conditioner
However, Rees does not feel that
the wrong mental attitude is the
only thing holding the squad back.
“To many of the boys think of
cross country as merely a way to
get in shape for track and not as
a sport. This kind of philosophy
does not do the team any good.”
What could help the team is
more support from the student
body. “I'm sure there are more
than a few boys in school that
could be a help to the team if
they came out.”

Concerning the defeats at the
hands of small schools Rees points

. out, that “it doesn't take much to

field a cross country team. Its
not like football or track where
you need large numbers to field a
good team.

“These small schools are becom-
ing interested in the sport and Find

it is one sport they can succeed in 1

because it takes so few athletes.”

At the present time the team’s
first four men are all sophomores.
Rees is hopeful that they “can get
over the losing complex they

thave,” and come back next year.

Carver. Russell Jalbert, director
of public relations commented,
“We ﬂatly and categorically
deny any validity to the Cour-
ier’s accusations.”

Friends of the University sub-
mit the names of possible players,
Jalbert said in explaining recruit-
ing procedure. Approximately 250
names are brought up and check-
ed each year. 

“We then watch the boys play,
talk to his coaches and high
school counsellor, and talk with
the boy and his parents,” he con-
tinued. If the boy meets the above
requirements satisfactorily as
well as meets the general‘ admis-
sion and academic standards he is
offered the standard scholarship.

In the past year, according to
Jalbert, O22 Negro boys were
screened. “Most did not meet all
the standards,” he said.

Two of the 22 met all the re-
quirements and were offered
scholarships. Of these two, one
went elsewhere, and the other
did not enroll in any college.

“It is the boy’s decision to
make. We cannot be criticized for
it.” Jalbert said.

Allan Rankin, vice chancellor
for student affairs commented
“There is no deliberate discrimin-
ation at this University and there
isn’t going to be any. No one will
be able to prove discrimination
