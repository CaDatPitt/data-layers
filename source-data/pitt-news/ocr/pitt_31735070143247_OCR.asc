Pitt seniors and graduate stu-

take pictures as they walked through
the Petersen Events Center before
their commencement ceremony.

About 3,000 undergraduate and

Nearly 10,000 people appeared
to support them. «
The event opened with remarks

Two of the Universityis seven
major construction projects should
be completed in time for the start
of the Fall term.

The renovations to Amos Hall
and the fifth ﬂoor of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, which began in
October, should be completed
by mid-July, said Pitt spokesman
John Fedele.

The nine sororities who had to
move their 135 combined members
from Amos Hall to Bruce Hall will

Swine flu hysterlcs
cloud reason

After days of borderline panic
and states of emergency, fears of the
swine ﬂu are slowly being grounded.
, This comes as Allegheny County ex-
? pects conﬁrmation of its first case of
the virus, according to the Pittsburgh
Tribune-Review.

3 Hopefully, newfound reason
and level heads will allow this area

a respite from the sensationalism

and marketing so prevalent from the
outbreak. Early reports claimed that
hundreds died as swine ﬂu spread
through the air with a swift unpre-
dictability. On April 27, Fox News
estimated that more than 100 Mexi-
cans died from swine ﬂu, and, like
many other major news outlets, it
drew comparisons to the 1918 Span-
; ish _ﬂu that killed almost 50 million
 people.

i The virus invaded pop culture, as
 well, spawning jokes and merchan-
 dise, like “I feel swine” T-shirts and
E designer surgical masks. The varied
 response of near-pandemic alerts
ji multifariously said there was no cause
 for alarm, which created these two
i publics —- the jaded and the hypo-
 chondiiacs --— when the truth was
 more moderate. i

I All the hype buried substantive
 details and perspectives. Swine ﬂu
 — now euphemistically redubbed
 H1Nl orinﬂuenzaA—poses some
 potential dangers, but nowhere near
 validation of the initial reaction. Cur-
rent estimates in The New York
 Times place the death toll in Mexico
 around 26, and two in the United
 States. This number doesn’t come
 close to earlier wild speculation, such
.' as an April 30 CNN report that said,
 “Health officials suspect swine ﬂu in
 more than 150 deaths” in Mexico.
 For comparison, traditional strains
 of the ﬂu cause about 36,000 deaths
 per year, according to the Centers
 for Disease Control and Prevention.
 Even one death remains tragic, but
 such conjecture hinders rational solu-
 tions to real threats.

‘ While the ﬂu continues to spread
 among humans, the rate seems to
E have ebbed, and the CDC no longer
 advocates closing schools as an ef-

affect young adults worse than other

fective measure to hinder the ﬂu’s
proliferation. Crises sell, and now
that reasoned analyses have surfaced,
rather than unfounded paranoia,
stories have been pushed to health
sections and news snippets.

Educational articles exist, but they
are increasingly marginalized in favor
of newer hysteria. Unfortunately, this
treatment drifts over some actual
threats still lingering from the swine
ﬂu. While its spread appears to be
relenting, the prospect still exists for
its return during regular ﬂu season —
the fall, when many college students
return to their schools — as a more
virulent mutation. V

As universities act like enlarged‘
Petri dishes, this contagion could

demographics. Immune systems in
young adults are more active than
in infants or the elderly. As such, an
infection could provoke an over-
reaction of their immune systems,
which can cause ﬂuid buildup in the
lungs.

Afﬂicted young people" can pre-
vent these worst-case scenarios by
visiting a doctor as soon as symp-
toms manifest. Most swine ﬂu cases 3
have turned out mild, in some cases
no worse than ordinary illnesses
when treated properly. Yet these
reports were founded in obscurity,
as opposed to previous front—page
claims of a coming pandemic.

Cautious observers might feel l

that overprotection better suits the
public than a preparatory void. This, M
though, is a false choice. Previous
disease frenzies should have refined
reaction to the swine ﬂu. Instead,
nothing was learned from SARS,
avian ﬂu, West Nile virus, mad cow
disease and so on. Chicken Littles ,
treated swine ﬂu like another world— 
threatening phantasm, like another E
attack of killer bees or Y2K —with
salient details drowning in specula-
tion and panic that the human race
faced extinction.

 

o inions

Now that those details have,
emerged, it’s on to another crisis, 
until something like ox pneumonia
recaptures our attention.

‘Real’ food key to long, healthy life

A recent report from NPR dis-
cussed a tiny Greek island in the
North Aegean Sea. This island,
known as Icaria, has been dubbed a
blue zone, an area where residents
usually live longer and healthier. To
discover how these people lived so
long —— nearly one in three make
it to the age of 90 -——- researchers
analyzed their lifestyles and diet.

Regarding the latter, the re-
searchers conducted Various tests
to discover which nutrients or vi-

tamins in the foods of Icaria made
the people live so long. No doubt
preposterous diets will emerge
once the results receive publicity.

has conquered our kitchens. We
are driven to eat based on the num-
ber of calories we consume or the
speciﬁc ratio of vitamins we need.
But what this has led to, according
to Pollan, is an’ overall decrease in
health for Americans. H

This is because, through nutri-
tionism, anything can be made to
sound healthy, so long as it contains
the right balance of vitamins and
minerals. ‘Even if such a blend is
missing, anything is all right to eat
as long as itavoids any demonized
part of the food pyramid, such as
fats and carbohydrates.

In this way, nutritionism plays
very well into the hands of the food
industry, which relies on scientiﬁc
studies to prove the benefits of its
products. Everything can become
a health food. It only requires the
correct endorsements and labels.

But this mindset has led to any-
thing but health for Americans. By
relying on speciﬁc nutrients and

nothing else, ‘we keep ourselves.

from getting any of the‘ thousands
of essential, uncategorized pieces
of real food. I
Instead of focusing, on nutri-
ent contents, Pollan offers a sim-

ple. yet intricate set of guidelines:
“Eat food. Not too much. Mostly
plants.” When he talks about food,
he doesn’t refer to simply anything
someone might ﬁnd on supermar-
ket shelves. Much of what’s out
there, Pollan says, are edible‘food—
like substances that carry with
them various health claims.

Pollan puts the responsibility
back into the hands‘ of consumers
to first distinguish what is healthy
and then get consumers back in the
kitchen to make their own food.
The second is self—explanatory but
the first is simpler than it seems.

For instance, if a product needs to

prove how healthy it is, it probably

isn’t good for you.

One can argue that Pollan’s
Views are elitist and that only the
rich will have access to his diet.
It’s common knowledge that or-
ganic food is more expensive. But
that’s not what Pollan advocates
—— though he wouldn’t oppose it.
Instead, this diet is more about re-
 to foods that don’t require
ingredient labels.

We’ve often heard of the para-

dox regarding many European cul-
tures that have diets high in fat and

anders to food industry

a population of healthy people. In
the United States, we are presented
with a similar paradox: Many peo-
ple are obsessed with health while
many others are some of the un-
healthiest people in the world.

i \When we try to find a new trend
that will reverse such poor health,
eating real food is often overlooked
as too simple. Instead, we need a
miracle fruit high in antioxidants
or  with “low-fat” written
across the package for us to feel
healthy. But the simplest solution
could be the best en route to creat-
ing a healthier country.

“Rock ’n’ Roll”

Tom Stoppard
Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre
@ Henry Heymann Theatre May 7-30

Who knew that rock ’n’ roll
could have political roots?

Vaclav Havel was a playwright
whose anti-communist comedies
and revolutionary involvement led
to his censure and imprisonment in
what was previously Czechoslova-
kia. But once the Velvet Revolution
launched Czechoslovakia into de-
mocracy, Havel’s actions were’ na-
tionally recognized, and he became
president of what would become
the Czech Republic.

Playwright Tom Stoppard dedi-

cates his play, “Rock ’n’ Roll,” to
this man. Stoppard, born in the
Czech Republic, acknowledges
Havel’s anti—communist writing as
one of his greatest inﬂuences.
lStoppard’s “Rock ’n’ Roll,” a
play about the inﬂuence of rock
music on the eventual demise of
communist regimes in Czecho-
slovakia, premiered in London in
2005. Andrew Paul, the artist direc-
tor of Pittsburgh Irish and Classi-
cal Theatre, decided to make the
music-driven performance available
to local audiences this spring.
Paul said he believes the play
makes a good case for the argument
that it was a shaggy-haired rock
band, The Plastic People of the
Universe ~— not the typical politi-
cal rhetoric —+ thatcaused the shift

Communists, take heed. You're no match for the triumphant combination of Czechs, love and "Rock 'n' Roll."

As for the  narrative of the
film, it consists of a ship full of rogue

With the amount of history and culture
at which “Rock ’n’ Roll” hints, Stoppard
evidently has plenty about which to sing.

For the ﬁfth time in six years, the armual City Game will take place
at PNC Park. It will be the 81st meeting between the two teams.

by Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

The dream of every young ball-
player is to one day tread the same
turf their major—league heroes did
when they watched them play. Usu-
allythis chance is only possible if
they can dedicate themselves to
getting to the major leagues.

But for the Pitt baseball play-
ers, that opportunity comes while
they’re still in college.

Pitt and Duquesne will meet
today in the 81 st annual City Game.
But it will be just the ﬁfth year
the game will take place at PNC
Park.

There’s a reason why players
long for a shot at the major leagues.
Who wouldn’t enjoy personal lock-
ers with his names emblazoned in
metallic letters or competing on a
perfectly manicured ﬁeld that is
maintained around the clock for

' his beneﬁt?

And then there’s PNC Park,
arguably the nicest stadium in
the major leagues, with its view
of Downtown Pittsburgh and
beautiful blue—toned steel design
that pleases the most passionate

baseball enthusiast.

The game itself is the easy part
for the Panthers, as they know
they need good innings from their
pitchers to shut down a potent
Duquesne lineup. But even play-

as

You have to just play your
game, I guess, just like a major
league baseball player.

ing at PNC Park might not faze
some players who have previously
had the same opportunity.

“It’s pretty cool walking through
the tunnels and sitting in the dug-
outs where the major leaguers sit,”
sophomore pitcher Corey Baker
said. “But we’re taught as a player
to not show too much emotion
and be professional about it. We
just do the best to keep it under
control.”

Baker, who was on hand for last

sports

for game at PNC Park

year’s City Game, said he couldn‘t
get too caught up in looking
around the stadium because he
was focused on the game.

The past experience at the sta-
dium will help in today’s match-
up, said Baker, and the same was
brought up by sophomore inﬁelder
Joe Leonard, who played at PNC
Park in high school.

“It was awesome just to be
there,” Leonard said. “Being in the
same dugout and the same ﬁeld as’
the Pirates is awesome. When you
play there the ﬁrst time, you’re deﬁ-
nitely nervous, and the next time
you’ll be more comfortable.”

Playing in a major league sta-
dium gives players the chance to
enjoy the stadium’s features. That’s
why it’s important for some players
‘to take in the scenery before the
game starts.

“You come out onto the ﬁelglm

and you get some time to look
around,” Leonard said. “But We’re
going out there to win. We’re play-
ing Duquesne. We’re going to play
our game and hopefully come out
on top.” ,

Even though the players view

ished in the top half of competing schools at
the Big East Outdoor Championships.

With 42 points, the men ﬁnished 10th
out of 14 teams, and the women’s 44 points
placed the team eighth out of 15 teams in
the weekend event hosted by Villanova Uni-
versity.

Hobwana placed ﬁrst in the 100-meter
dash with a time of 10.57 seconds, just two-
hundredths of a second" off an NCAA re-
gional qualifying time. He also placed sec-
ond in the 200—meter dash with a time of
21.59. The sophomore’s times in both events
qualiﬁed him for the IC4A Championships,
which take place May 15-17 in Princeton, N.J.
Jones and freshman Folarin Ijelu also quali-
ﬁed for the IC4A Championships and were
awarded All—Big East honors for their leaping
abilities. Jones ﬁnished first in the triple jump
with a mark of 15.02 meters and ninth in
the long jump. Ijelu’s jump of 14.04 meters
placed him third in the triple jump, and he
ﬁnished ﬁfth in the long‘ jump with a score
of 7.05 meters.

The ﬁnal Panther to qualify for the IC4A

Championships on the men’s side was sopho-
more Garrett Larkin. Larkin came in sixth in
the shot put by throwing 16.24 meters.

On the women’s side, Clemons continued
to lead the team by winning the 100-meter
hurdles event at 13.59 seconds. The senior
also ﬁnished seventh in the 400-meter hur-
dles with a time of 63.39 seconds. Both times
were NCAA regional qualifying times.

 immediately behind Clemons
in the 400-meter hurdles was junior Brianna
Broyles, who ﬁnished eighth with a time of
65.33 seconds.

Freshman Cambrya Jones turned in an
Eastern College Athletic Conference cham-
pionship qualifying time of 11.87 seconds
during her fourth-place ﬁnish in the 100
meters dash. She also scored a second—place
ﬁnish in the 200—meter dash with an NCAA
regional qualifying time of 23.77 seconds.
Her performance earned her All-Big East
honors.

SeniorJanessa Murphy also qualiﬁed for
the ECAC championship in the long jump
and triple jump, and sophomore Kaitlyn Fly-
nn in the heptathlon. Murphy also received
All—Big East honors, as did AnitaJames, who
jumped 12.14 meters in the triple jump.

The ECAC Championships will take
place in Princeton May 15-17.

With Big East tournament
ahead, youth expected to shine

City Game, page 9

the non—conference tilt as an important game,
in the past the game has been an underclass-
men display for both teams. Last year, Pitt
coach JoeJordano relied on three freshmen
to step up for other teammates taking care of
academic commitments. Phillip Konieczny,
John Schultz and David Kaye starred in Pitt’s
17-6 victory at PNC Park last year.

Konieczny, a reserve inﬁelder, was 4 for
5 with ﬁve RBIs. Designated hitter Schultz
also batted 4 for 5 with three runs scored and
an RBI. And the right-hander Kaye allowed
just one hit in four 1-3 scoreless innings to
pick up his ﬁrst collegiate victory.

The Panthers’ victory last season gave
them a 4-1 al1—time series edge over Duquesne
at PNC Park, with 2007’s game being can-
celed because of poor ﬁeld conditions.

The reason underclassmen take over in
these matchups is Pitt’s remaining schedule.
The City Game usually marks the stretch run

for the Panthers on their way to qualifying
for the Big East tournament. Last year, Pitt
faced conference opponents in 15 of its last
22 games heading into the postseason tour-
nament. But the Panthers failed to qualify.

The Panthers hope to change that this
year, so the team expects to stay fresh for
its upcoming series against Connecticut and
West Virginia to end its regular season.

But for one day, the Panthers will expe-
rience life as major league baseball players.
They will hit in the same batter’s boxes and
ﬁeld on the same grass the best players in
the country do.

Maybe the best advice came from Corey
Brownsten, a junior catcher for the Pan-
thers. J

“It’s a great experience, but I’m just going
to play the game,” Brownsten said. “You
have to just play your game, I guess, just like
a major league baseball player.”

Panthers fail to make Bi

Softball, page 9

the Panthers have struggled with all year:
consistency.
The young team found it difﬁcult to ﬁnd

a steady level of success, particularly on the _

offensive end.

' Pittsburgh 3, Rutgers 0
Pittsburgh 5, Rutgers 6 v

In the first game against Rutgers, fresh-

’ man inﬁelders Kristen Cheesebrew and

Niki Cognigni each supplied two hits as the
Panthers defeated the Scarlet Knights 3-0.
The win was Pitt’s seve-nth shutout of the
season. Cheesebrew and Cognigni improved
throughout the season, Aprile said, making
them solid defensive forces in the key posi-
tions of second base and shortstop.

The Panthers played solid defense like
they had throughout the season. In the sec-
ond inning, the Panthers stranded two Scar-
let Knights on base after forcing sequential
ground balls. _ _

Back—to—back plays at home plate off-
throws from Reba. Tutt and Cognigni kept
Rutgers from getting on the board in the
sixth inning.

Pitcher Cory Berliner picked up her third
shutout of the season, striking out four bat-
ters while sealing her ninth victory.

“Pitching has been a strength all season,
and we have also been pretty strong defen-
sively,” Aprile said.

In the second game, the Panthers fell to
Rutgers 6-5.

A game—tying, three—run home run by
Tutt at the bottom of the seventh sent the
game into extra innings.

. Rutgers scored a run in the top of the
eighth inning, winning" the game after the
Panthers failed to answer. '

Pittsburgh 4, South Florida 9
Pittsburgh 8, South Florida 0

Pitt seniors Sam Card and Kaitlyn Schus-
ter were honored before the South Florida

‘doubleheader. Card _and Schuster guided the

Panthers to three consecutive Big East tour-
nament appearances and 103 wins. Those
victories make them the winningest senior
class in Pitt history. . .

Schuster, a pitcher, and Card, a catcher,
have achieved several single-season Pitt re-
cords.

But with only two seniors on the squad,
the Panthers‘ were a young team this season.
Aprile said the youth created a learning curve
and that the season of experience has helped
he Panthers improve and should aid the
younger players next year.

“V/e’ve gotten better at communicating

ion the field,” Aprile said. ‘‘We’ve matured

overall and [the freshinen] have deﬁnitely
grown from [experience] .”

’ Pitt held an advantage twice in the first
game against South Florida. In the bottom

A of the ﬁrst inning, Cognigni drove in two

runs to give the Panthers a 2-0 advantage.
Three innings later, Cognigni drove in an-
other run to give the Panthers a 4-3 lead.
But the Panthers wouldn’t score again as
the Bulls scored ﬁve runs in the sixth and
seventh innings to seal their 9-4 victory.

 

We have coverage designed especially for Pitt students.

In the second game, the Panthers earned
their second shutout in four games and their
eighth in the season.

The Panthers mercy—ruled the Bulls in
ﬁve innings, winning their ﬁnal game of
the season 8-0.

Freshman Amanda Heitmeier went 3-3 A

and drove in two of Pitt’s four runs in the
contest. Pitcher Kayla Zinger picked up the
victory, while allowing six hits and picking
up one Strikeout.
