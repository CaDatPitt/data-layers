Rabbi Chaim Potok, au-
thor of the best selling nov-
el The Chosen, discussed the
quesﬁion of why a rabbi uses
the form of fiction to make
basic points about human
life, in a lecture at the YM
& WHA Thursday.

“Literature in the United
‘States is generally iconoclastic,
image breaking,” Rabbi Potok
said. “From Hawthorne’s Scar-_
let Letter to Hem-ingwiay’s nov-
els in which he lays bare lip-
-service morality. Amenlcan lit-
erature has ‘had a motif that at-
tacks fundamental values which
are given only lip-service by
those who profess to adhere to
them.

Students for Peace (SFP) will demonstrate Tuesday and
Wednesday in protest of the presence of a number of recruiters
from the Dow Chemical Corporation at the University.

The demonstrations will take place directly in front of
the Student Union on both days from 11 am. to 1 pm.

Napalm is composed of gasoline, .benezene, and poly-
stryene. This’ substance is presently being employed by the
United States Air Force in ‘Vietnam. It is primarily used against
those villages suspected to be controlled by members of the ,N a-
tional Liberation Front.

Napalm is a weapon that explodes and sticks to anything
it touches, burning ﬂesh and the underlying nerves. It has been
banned .by both the Geneva and Hague conventions as an illegal
weapon. '

Dow is presently the only organization involved in the man-
ufacture of Napalm and has repeatedly refused to debate its
Justification for the Chemlcal's production.

The president of SFP, Ivan Abrams, has emphasized that

it Tuesday and Wednesday’s demonstrations will be conducted
in an orderly fashion. ‘*

takes a secondary play. Why
then does a rabbi use this at-
tack oriented ﬂitenaiture and why
does he use a discipline given
second place to, in Jewish tra-
dition?" he asked.

In answer to this question,
Rabbi Potok explained that he
had read voraciously as a young
man and had been inspired by
the writings of Evelyn Waugh
to commit himself to the writ-
ing of fiction. He then entered
the Jewish Theological Semin-
ary of America and discovered
“a creative force, a. vitality that
I never knew wasthere. I made
a commitment to teach this tria-
dition."

Faced with a conflict between
teaching and writing, the desire
to write proved stronger. At the

Rabbi Potok said.

He spent his next four ‘years
in thought, "looking out a win-

that the destructive element in
this literature concealed “aseme

thors had suffered, a cry for
things to be -as they ouighrlz to

Justice Without Revenge

by STEVE GITTLESON
The University Theatre pres-
ented its first performance of
Dope de Vega’s Justicewithout

Revenge Friday evening.

The play takes place in Me-
dieval Ita-ly. The Duke of Fer-
rara is being forced by his ad-
visors to marry the beautiful
Cassandra as a measure to cure
his “untamed disposition” and
to insure a legal heir after hiss
death. The advisors wish to pre-
vent the discontent that would
arise if Count Federico, the
Duke’s illegitimate son, were
named ruler of Ferrara. The
Duke, who lo-ves -his bastard son
dearly, unwillingly gives into
his ~advi»sor’s council.

MA I -1724

The Duke returns to Ferrara,
ready to give up his sinful past.
He finds out in a letter about
the affair between his wife and
his son. He is forced to seek jus-
tice but not revenge. The death
of Federico and Cassandra. is
hea.ven’s will and not his own.
The lovers die and the play
ends.

Justice without Revenge is a

the Duke’s marriage, Cassandra
voices her distress over the
Dukes failure to make love to
her and his constant ﬂirting
with other women. The Duke
tells Federico about Aurora’s
marriage proposal, but Federico
mocks this proposition, stating
that Aurora loves the Marquis
Gonzaga.

Alone together, Federico and
Cassandra confess their love to-
ward each other, both afraid to
state this unfortunate love in
deﬁnite terms. Aurora, suspici-
ous of Federico’s lack of inter-
est in her, tries to make Federi-
co jealous by ﬂirting with the
Marquis Gonzago.

The Duke is requested by the
Pope to come to Rome on cru-
cial matters. He orders Federico
to stay behind and take care of
his business during his absence.
Federico, afraid of betraying his
father's honor, requests that -he
accompany the Duke t-o Rome.
His father declines this -request.

Unable to restrain their emo-
-tions any longer, Federico and
Cassandra discretely make love.
Aurora hiding in Oassandra’es
bed chamber discovers the -pair
together. Federico asks Aurora
to marry him in order t-0 hide
the sinful affair with -his fathers
wife, but Aurora  -fed up and
rebuffs his proposallss.

edy which very closely follows
the plot of Phaedra. One sees
the downfall of Federico clear-
ly -in Aris-toilian terms: -he per-
fectly ﬁts into the Aristot-le’s
de-ﬁni-tion of -the .-tragic hero. In
many ways, the Duke falls into
this mold as well. The plot ap-
pears contrived at times, but it
hold interest through the entire
perforrnance.

Special homage must be paid
to the members of the Universi-
ty Theatre. The sets were art-
ful, the musical background
were colorful, and the perform-
uances by all members of .-the
cast we-re deft.

The one aspect of Friday's
performance that I did not like
was the abundance of empty
zseat-s.

For those who have doubts about
superior theatrical ability on
 cam-pus, go -see Justice with-
out Revenge.

y_ Frederick’s actions or playing

We urge President Frederick not to discount the apathy displayed
by the majority of senators. Even though there are only a few months
left in this administration, there is still time to rectify a very poor situa-
tion. Senators are assigned to committees, but there is no effective corre-

lation between what they are d-oing~and what the executive branch is
achieving. A perfect example is the SG Committee on Book Center Policy.
The Committee was established last year when the news broke concerning
Auxiliary Enterprises Director John Langstaff’s dual capacity as owner
of Your Campus Store and head of the University Book Center’s opera-
tion. On their own, the Committee met with Langstaff and arranged to
have their pictures taken at the meeting. They also prepared an article
on their session for The Pitt News. All of this was done without the SG

Student Government (SG) had 12 senators present at the Se-nate
meeting last Wednesday; 13 constitutes a quorum. As a senator called for
a quorum, the Senate had to adjourn after hearing the President’s report.
__Q_ We are really puzzled -over the senators’ behavior. During the meet-

ings, there are senators always ready and eager to criticize the SG exe-
cutive"s behavior, claiming that the executive branch completely domin-
ates SG. Yet it seems to be an effort for a good many senators to spare
two evenings a month to atten-d a Senate meeting, let alone explore other‘

Instead of always‘ pointing the finger at the executive branch, we
think it is about time some of the senators examine their own records. In
two or three cases, senators can honestly say they have done their job.
However, in practically every instance, we can cite half-hearted partici-
pation and a failure to contribute to the achievement of a functioning SG.

The poor performance of the senators necessitates an immediate
definition of their role. The senators have on the whole shown no real
interest in trying to determine what their role should be. They are quick
to protest actions taken by SG President Ken Frederick. In fact, the only
time most senators show any enthusiasm is when they are condemning

politics.

 

executive branch’s knowledge.

The issue of the Book Center policy was also explored by President
Frederick in his participation on the Committee to Review Book Center
Policy. On his own, he worked with the two other student representatives
to alter the current situation in the Book Center. A more effective effort
would have been made if the SG committee would have coordinated its
works with Frederick’s attempts. The situation required a much more
detailed investigation than the SG committee conducted. It also required
that the SG executive branch work hand in hand with the Senate to achieve
maximum results. ‘

If the Senators are given no responsibility and direction, it is un-

likely that they can fulfill their obligations. We are not exonerating the

senators, especially those serving in their second year, whose performance
has been lackadaisical, to say the least. We do feel thatboth parties are
to blame in this instance. They must begin really to Work together if they
are ever going to begin fulﬂilling the role of a Student Government.

qulaliﬁcations as a sociologist,
.one should not wtirthhold grati-
tude from his attempt to clari-
fy the functional relationship
between ROTC and the m-ilitary,

on the one hand, and “societal
“values” on the other. (See the

‘ Pitt News, Nov. 8, p. 4.) This
iteiaiioheeipmana ithe liliiilﬁfiiiﬁf
‘the’ Uhiversity in it is undoubt-
edly the fundamental issue of

tthe ROTC question.
Nevertheless, Mr. Booker’s ana-
[lysis belies his conventional
iﬁrame-of -reference — perhaps
 “_-the source of his elernenmary
_ =--logical error, his misrepresenta-
* “C tion of Studenrts for Peace"s pos-
 ition,” and, ‘finally, his grossly
‘- ~  and ‘hence inaccurate
‘ _  i

la 5 Mr.:fBooker’s logical error:

_'IThe reader should ﬁnst recall

- that Students for Peace has co-n-

; demhed the relation of the mili-

-  establishment to American

sion in the society” be con‘-
strued as a legitimazation of
the profession, particularly when
its legitimacy is what is in.ques-
tion? How can “the universal
affects of military service" be
regarded as a justification of
military instruction (e.g. ROTC),
especially when these universal
affects are the ma-inatargets of
nationwide criticism? Th.ievery
exists, but we condemn thieves;
murders happen, but we con-
demn murders. The rriillitary es-
tablishment exists, and SFP, itc-
;;_ethe_r, with hundreds of thou-
sans of Americans, condemn its
activities and values. To show
how the military functions is
irrelevant to -the moral charge.
Moreover, to confuse exposition
for refutation i-s to beg the ques-
tion. ,

> His misrepresentation of
SF‘P’s position: No, Mr. Booker,
CFP does not “predicate” its
“ear of military control of our
culture” (crude phraseology
maintained for purpose of con-
tinuity) on “a belief that the
values of the military run coun-
ter to those of society in gen-
eral." It is conceivable that (1)
the values of the military and
the values o-f society in general,
though d.iﬂ'erent to some degree,
are not incompatible; or that
(2) the values of the military
and of society may be, for all
practical purposes, identical; and
if such is the case, military con-
trol is less to be feared than
our becoming a nation of har-
barians.

No, Mr. Booker, Ivan Abrams
and SFP did not "dismiss the
contention that the men . . . in
-the Armed Forces are not mern-
bers of a special class, but are

Greeks Demand

‘News’ Coverage
Editor, The Pitt News:

We are writing this letter in
response to an a.rticle in the
Pitt News of Wednesday, Nov.
8, 1967, concerning Homecom-
ing. The title of this article was
“Sutherland House Gets Special
Trophy for Homecoming.” It 
certainly encouraging that a
dorm would have the school
spirit to en-ter the ﬂoat contest.
However, there were 15 other
ﬂoats at the game, many of
which were much better con-
structed than the Sutherland
ﬂ-oat—at least they made it to
the stadium without falling
apart. It certainly takes a lot
of -school -spirit to make a ﬂoat
—-no matter who makes it. But
that’-s not the impression one
gets by reading the Pitt News.

Our school paper completely
and deliberately ignored the
fact -that the sororities and fra-
ternities all spent much time
and effort on their ﬂoats. Not
one word was mentioned about
any of them. We feel we have
a right to be greatly disturbed
and irate.

Needless to say, we do not
appreciate the paper's anti-
Greek coverage, nor do we be-
lieve that the non-Greeks on
campus take it seriously. How-
ever, we feel it is unvprincipled
behavior when a school news-

paper uses this type of cover-
age‘ for a major school event.
The author of the article im-

p plies that sororities and frater-

nities can easily make a ﬂoat be-
cause of their ,. pledge classes.
We might inform the author
that every member of a sorority
or fraternity participates in the
making of the ﬂoat——and we are
just as busy in school as every-
one else. In fact, we have less
manpower to draw upon than
a dorm. Neither is the expense
so tremendous -that only soror-
ities and fraternities can parti-
cipate. Sutherland House proved
the fallacy of this assumption.
Therefore, it seems unfair to
us, and to most Greeks on cam-
-pus, that we were completely
ignored, as well as insulted, by
the policy of the Pitt News.

STRAIGHT
TALK

by Jay Rosenstein
Sports Editor

   

 

TWO SIDES TO A STORY
The thin red line laced its way along Terry Hanratty’s
shoulder until it grew into an ugly red blotch. Hanratty’s
shoulder pads ha-dn"t softened the blow quite enough. ‘
The All-American quarterback had been hit while hold-
ing for Joe Azzaro’s first conversion attempt. It appeared
as if Joe Curtin had deliberately run into Hanratty, and
indeed the referee called Curtin for unnecessary roughness.
‘.‘It was a cheap shot,” grimaced Hanratty. “I was no-

‘ where near the ball.” When he got back to the bench, Han-

ratty asked it anyone had caught the guy’s number. “I
didn’t ask them to retaliate,” Hanratty was quick to add.
“But I hope they did.”

A _ THE NEXT TIME the Irish had the ball, Curtin came
upfrom 1/1is halfback position on an end sweep and was

 promptly cut down. He had to leave the game for a few

plays to let one of the trainers look at him.

'C-urttin denied that Notre Dame had retaliated. “To
begin with,” he explained, “I was trying to block the kick,
but Notre Dam.e’s blocking forced me to go wide. I didn’t go

c ‘after Hanratty intentionally.”

Ara Parseghian thought differently. “Ara asked me
after the game why number 29 had hit Hanratty,” related
Dave Hart. “He told me “We don’t teach our kids dirty

‘ football.”

“I RESENTED what he said about Joe,” Hart fumed.
“Joe’s not th-at kind of k,‘id who’d deliberately hurt some-
body. I d-idn’t point out how Curtin was later clipped. I

i guess I should have. But when you win, you can say all you

want.”
The Hanratty incident wasn’t all that distressed Par-

seghian on a day when his team coasted to victory. “You
know,” Parseghian declared, “ever since that 1965 game
with Southern Cal on national T.V., people say we like to
come on thefﬁield late to keep the other team waiting. It’s
just not so. We come to play football. That psychological
‘warfare bit is a lot o-f garbage. Pitt was late today.”

PARSEGHIAN IMPLIED that Hart was using bush
tactics. Hart’s only reply was, “It didn’t work.”
While the two coaches expressed their love for each

i other, Hanratty was busy signing hundreds of autographs

for the little kids inside and outside the No-tre Dame locker

. room. “I’ve been looking forward to coming back home for

three years,” the Butler native smiled.
Panthers Art Alois and Jay McCune congratulated

I ‘Hanratty on the field after the game. He had been their

teammate on the Big'33 team. He could have been their

.1 teammate Saturday afternoon at Pitt Stadium. Hanratty

wouldn't have hurt any university.
But that's another story.

6 Ohio State Frosh Overpower Cubs,36 -20

by JERRY GRUEBEL
COLUMBUS, Ohio — It

Lewis as he thought back at the
numerous quarterback keepers
that Ohio State used successful-

;was a determined freshman 1y_
 football team which travel-

The first keeper went for 19
yards early in the ﬁrst quarter.
Kern dropped back and faked a
‘hand-off to fullback Tatum, kept
the ball, and ran to the outside.
Then, after forcing the Cubs to
punt the ball midway in the
opening quarter, Kern tied the
opening quarter, Kern tried the
same play again and scampered
75 yards for a touchdown that
tied the score at 6-6.

Early in the second quarter,

ed to Ohio State Friday. They
were determined to win. But.
they didn’t. And «there were
good resasons, not excuses for
the 36-20 loss.

One reason was a faulty de-
fense. A powerful Acorn back-
-ﬁelhd ran through and around
Cub defenders. Fullback Jack
Tatum; halﬁbacks Larry Selinas,
Leo Haden, and John Brocking-
ton; and quarterbacks Rex Kern
-and Ron Maciej-owski, all con-

  

tributed to an overpowering
Acorn offense that went to the

air only ﬁve times during the

entire game. But the quarter-
back runs hurt the most.
“Our defensive ends played

6 poorly "~ admitted pcoaeh Darrell

 

   

Kern scored again on a quarter-
back sneak from one yard out,
and then ran for the two points-
after on another keeper. The
rest of the Acorn backﬁeld ran
for three additional touchdowns
afterwards.

utmuscles Panthers, -0

noon trying to scramble for his life. Above, left,

GEORGE LIES, Associate Sports Editor

Eveiiilhefore Notre Dame overpowered the Panthers,

38-0, at the Stadium Saturday, the Cats were losers.
After Notre Dame took their pre-game practice, they left the
ﬁeld to hear Ara Parseghi=an’s 1-ocker room talk. The Panther play-

ers, still exercising, watched in
awe as the Irish jaunted down
each sideline to leave the ﬁeld;
-it seemed the Panthers were
surrounded.

And for quarterbacks Jeff
Barr and Chuck Winters, the
‘-trend -continued throughout the
afternoon.

If it wasn’t 275 pound Kevin
Hardy and 270 pound Mike Mc-
Coy, striking from the tackle
positions, it was Bob Olson and
John Pergine blitzing from the
linebacker spots. _,

Barr and Winrters never -had
a chance. The Irish front four
opened gaps, through which
Pergine<,a_nd Olson pursued and
forced the quarterbacks to hur-
ry/I passes, ‘many times over-
throwing receivers. Sometimes,
Barr and Winters simtply threw
away the ball while the Irish
defenders were chasing them 15
to 20 yards back from -the line
of scrimmage. .

Disdained over the inevitable
outcome, Dave Hart appeared
rather at ease in the locker
room, after the game. Of course,
there weren't hundreds of peo-
ple milling around outside hi-s
quarters, as there were in front

day,” complained aassisrtlant coach
John Rosenberg from the side-
lines. “They're not getting in
there and hitting had.”

Another reason for losing may
have .been the absence of full-
back Tony Esposito and quar-
terback Don Plusquellic. But
Lewis didn’t seem to feel that
it was a valid excuse.

“If we had Esposito and Plus-
quellic we might have been in
the game,” explained Lewis,
“but you can’t tell if we would
have won. They were real good.”

The Little Buckeyes were good,
and that might have been the
best reason of all for losing.

’“We had bad breaks at the
end of the game,” noted Lewis,
referring to the interception
late in the fourth quarter that
stopped a. Cub drive after the
score was 30-20, “but they were
big and strong. Ohio State is
going to be good.” V

 

of Notre Dame's locker room.

Fixing his tie and wiping the
sweat from his brow, Hart stat-
ed the facts of losing. “Our
quarterbacking wasn’t good. But
did you look at those behemoths
rushing?” he asked.

“We had n=ot been attacking,
and it was technical things we
missed,” remarked Hart.

The only time the Panthers
moved the ball at all was when
Winters quarterbacked.

From the Panther 36, Willr
ters passed to Joe McCain at
the Lr_i§!3 .26: interferense was
called against defensive back
Tom Quinn, but McCain had
made a circus catch to give the
Jungle Cats their deepest pene-
tration into Notre Dame terri-
tory.

Winters then threw to Rod
Fedorchak, slanting from his
tight end position and had the
[Panthers on the Irish nine, goal
to go.

Then, with many of the 54,-
705 fans still left in the Stadium,
Hart removed Wi'nters for Barr.
Apparently, Winters was limp-
ing when he joined the Panther
huddle at the nine, and Hart felt

The game had one bright spot.
That was wingback Dave Gar-
-nett, a Buffalo recru-irt who runs
the hundred in 9.5. Garnett
scored all ‘three Cub touchdowns.

His ﬁrst came on the ﬁrst of-
fensive play of the game. The
Cubs were on the Acorn 17-yard
line and quarterback Mike Ban-
non handed-off to Garrett, Gar-
nett broke to the left and appear-
ed to be trapped at the line of
scrimmage, but he broke a tac-

kle and ran to the right. Once
he got to the outside, Garnett

was gone on an 83-yard sprint.

Garnett also scored on a ﬁve-
yard outside sweep late in the
third quarter and a six-yard re-
ception from a Bannon pass late
in the fourth quarter.

In all, Garnett ran for 136
yards in 19 carries and received
two passes for another 12 yards.

 

as E?

he is dragged down by blitzing linebacker Bob
Olson. Right, he is trapped by end Bob Kuechen-
lberg (75) and linebacker Mike McGrill .(60).

ered, and the Panthers only
threat of the day was stopped.

Only the defensive sutruggiles
by the Panthers in the early
moments of each half impressed
Hart.

But each time, a «poor punrt by
George Medich after the Cats
took over the ball, gave Notre
Dame ﬁeld positi-on, and a sec-
ond short at a tired, bedraggled
Panther defense.

-Terry Hanrattly, from near-
by Butler, moved the Irish with
passes, despite the absence of
Jim Seymour, and also with
his running.

He scored two touchdowns. A
16-yard scamper, after breaking

away from three Panther tac- A

klers, and a two yard run, after
a fake to full-back Jeff Zimmer-
man fooled the defense.

“We were delighted to win,”
said Parseghian. “But it’s not
our best. We played rather slop-
pily today.

“There’s a. lot young kids on
Pitt's team, and they’re learn-
ing,” Parseghian pointed out
while being congratulated once
again by Notre Dame's many
followers.

And then, more repornters
swarmed around, and Parseg-
hian, the man who returned con-
ﬁdence to Notre Dame football,
was himself encompassed just
like the Panthers ‘had been, all
day long.

the ball and showed a lack of ex-
perience. They played the type
of ball we were playing in the
beginning of the season.”

Lou Vida booted a penalty
kick through in the middle of
the ﬁrst period to start the
fres~hmen’s biggest scoring day
of the season. Dry kicked his
ﬁrst goal la.ter in the same per-
iod to make the score 2-0.

In the third period Di Emido
tallied after taking a rebound

. to the left side. He scored again

two minutes later in the same
period in a scramble in front of
the goal.

After Di Emido -scored a third
time in the fourth period, Dry
kicked two more goals, the ﬁrst
on a steal, to close out the
frosh’s offensive. Ron Higgins
kicked Kent's only goal in the
fourth period, ten seconds be-
fore Dry’s last score.

“We got off to a disappoint-

ing start but we played good
ball in our last -three games,”

said coach Snyder. “We could

have won our ﬁrst game against
Slippery Rock and the Akron
game could have gone either
way.”

The frosh were also hurt by
injuries this season. Halfback
Dave Taub, who had ﬁgured
prominently in Snyder's scoring
plans, was injured against Slip-
pery Rock and was out for the
last three games, and Dave Dow-
han, a. defensive standout at
fullback, was sidelined with a
pulled hamstring in the Akron
game.

Snyder cited Di Emido as an
outstanding prospect for next
year’s Varsity. “Di Emido was
our best ball handler out there,
and he set up many of our
scoring plays,” he commented.
“Dave Dowhan and goalie Dick
Pasternak helped the team to-
gether on the ﬁeld and they
should also help the varsity
quite a bit next year.”

One goal was all the boot-
ers could score Friday, but
it was all they needed as
they defeated Kent State, 1-0.
The offense had numerous shots
on goal, many of them near
misses as a result of hurrying
the shots that were taken on
the run.

Dave S-him-peno, junior for-
ward Who led the bootens to
their only other victory this sea-
son over Bucknell, wedged a
shot into the net with 14 min-
utes gone in the second half.
S-him»pen~o’:s successful kick came
after Bob Trexler dribbled
through two Kent State defend-
ers and passed the ball across
the middle, where Shimpeno was
waiting.

Len Harm-on recorded his sec-
ond shutout of the season (the
other was inthe booters 3-0 win
over Bucknelll) as he and senior
fullback Joe Kruth led the de-
-fense with alert and aggressive
play.

Harmon said the Kent State it

offense hustled, but didn’t shoot
that well. He added that credit
for his shutout belonged to the
team, and Kruth in particular.
“Joe played one of his greatest
games for us today,” he noted.
“We will really miss him next
year.”

Kruth, along with forwards
Pete Snyder and Gary Foert-sch,
played h-is last home game for
the booters. All three were
pleased about ﬁnishing at home
with a win and are looking for-
ward to the season ﬁnale at
Penn State next Week, which
the three seniors feel the team
will win.

“We’ve got some pride in our-.

selves now,” said Harmon.
“'llhaJt’-s all we needed all season,
but we didn’t get the breaks

and couldn’t Win. Now the team
has won and feels it can keep
winning.” Harmon, junior goalie,
‘was referring not only to next
week's game at Penn State, but
to next year, as well.

Coach Leo Bemis said the
team had trouble getting to-
gether in the ﬁrst half. “Kent
State has a good team, but if
we would have scored early,
they would have caved in,” Be-
mis said. “The team was a lit-
tle unstable without Ernie.”

Bemis was taking about jun-
ior halfback Ernie Mouen, a

' mainstay on the team all year,

who -watched the game’ from the
sidelines only hours after his
release from the hospital. Ron
Mielecki, sophomore halfback,

started his ﬁrst game ‘and, ac-
cording to Bemi-s, “-did a fairly

good job” as Mouenis replace.-.

ment.
Frequent calls by the officials

slowed the play of the gamer 

and although Dvaile VanPa:t-ten,
Kent State h-allfback, was asked
to leave the game for rough
play, Bemis didn’-t term the

game as rough. “In-ept playing ,

caused more penalties to be call-
ed -than rough playing,” he

S«h:i.m«peno, who was injured
in the Bueknell game :and com-
men'te~.d that offensive players
‘receive the blunt of injuries, wlas‘

asked if the Kent State team, : -
was rough. “No,” the said, “They V " '

hustled, but our ﬁnesse ever-
came the hustle.”

“Bubba’s” Interception Ignites

by TEX MAWL

Poetry in motion. That’s what 80,000 fans must have thought to themselves as
they feel over each other in their exhuberance over Art “Bubba” Rosengarten and his —

fabulous high step.

All “Bubba” did was blook Denny “Get Off of My” Toback’s pass a’ la Ted Hendricks and‘
race (?) 38 yards for the winning score as the Pitt News Hawks whitewialshed the WPGH Killer
Cycles, 6-0, f-or the second win of the young season, and fourth straight over the last -two years.

Actually, the best show of the day came afterwards when scouts from the Sugar, Orange,
and Cotton—nout to mention Gotham———Bowls bat tled amongst each other fo-r the night to offer their

‘Beulah’ Captures Yogi Lead

A new cry has emerged
from the halls on the fourth
fl-oor. The old “Stop Mous-
tachio!” has been replaced by
“Stop Beulah!” as Linda “Beu-
lah” Goldstein moved into ﬁrst
place in the Yogi contest.

However, her opponents, Vow
that her sojourn on top will be
a brief one, so don’t celebrate
too early SG leaders. “I will
stomp her,” growled George
“Moustachio” Lies. “I just let
her get into the lead so that
my ﬁnal charge will be all the
more painful.”

“Moustachio” -lost his lead by
picking some underdogs, while
“Beulah” stayed with every fav-
orite as she does every week.

A couple of underdogs helped
Mike “Hawk” Brourman to an
11-4 week, and a more secure
hold on third place. “I will still

 

geance in his eyes and beer on
his breath. “I’ll pass the ‘Mous-
tache’ like he’s standing still.”
The “Hawk” completely dismiss-
ed “Beulah.” “Her presence is
irrelevant,” he said.

The bigg-est underdog of them
all, Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein
picked the upset of the week,
going with Oregon State «over
Southern Cal. “It was ‘a cinch,”
he stated. “After all, Southern
Cal is better.”

However, “Filatbush,” as us-
ual, picked too many losers and
now -is in a last place tie with
the girls. “This week we're go-
ing to put the Allderdice-We«sIt-
inghouse game on the sheet,” he
said. When informed that All-
derdice had already won he said,
“So what! Nobody beats the
House.”

   

bid to the Hawks ﬁrst.

Aside from “Bubba” there
were no real heroes for the
Hawks since everyone played
their normal superlative game,

For the Hawks, it was a great
emotional win. You could see it
in their faces. Paul “Wrong
Way” S-tolller was so drained
by his three near interceptions
that George “Moustachi-o”'Lies
—— ace quarterback and dare-
devil tightrope walker-hiad to
replace him. The Moustache in-

tercepted the ﬁrst pass thrown

his way.
“It was just one of those
things,” hummed coach Jay

“Flatbush” Rosenstein about ‘

nothing in particular after the
game. The Kid again spent his
major portion of the game coach-
ing from the sidelines. Then

with only seconds left, when his

charges had the game safely
tucked away, “Flatbush” came
off the bench to successfully
lose 11 yards on a sweep.

“We were just trying to run
out the clock,” rationalized
“F1-atbush.”
