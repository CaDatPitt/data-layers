Natural Gas Viewed Dorm Renovations Scheduled

Likely Blast Culprit

BY PETE BUTCH

Seven persons remain hospital-
ized, two seriously, as investigators
continue to digthrough the rubble
that once was Langley Hall’ s lecture
rooms in an effort to ﬁnd the exact
cause of Thursday afternoon’s
explosion that killed two persons.

_Life Sciences department chair-
man Maurice Sussman pinpointed
the explosion’s origin as the
electron microscope suite under-
neath lecture room 221. An
Equitable Gas Company natural gas
line ran through the suite.

Sussman and officials from Pitt,

city and campus police and the ﬁre P

department met Friday in a private
meeting called by County Coroner
Cyril Wecht in an attempt to
co-ordinate information and the
direction of the investigation.
Another meeting is planned for
today.

After the meeting, Wecht
announced that all persons in
Langley Hall were accounted for
and none were missing. He also
said there was no evidence for a‘
bomb. Pitt officials, however,
refused to make any comments after
the meeting.

The building is owned by

Dormitory renovations are
scheduled for the Medical Center
Nurses’ Residence (MCNR), and
McCormick residences to alleviate
the University’s chronic housing
crunch, according to University
Housing Director Don Hughes.

The renovations, which will add
124 beds to the dorms, consist of
turning select triple occupant
rooms into quadruples and a few
single rooms and lounges into
doubles and triples respectively,
Hughes said.

No firm ﬁgure has been set on
the renovation costs. but ‘Hughes
estimatedthey would run between
$63,000 to $72,000.

The renovations are being
undertaken in part, Hughes said,

because of the uncertainty of a
renewed housing contract with
Hotel Webster Hall and a halt in
plans to turn Bruce Hall, which
currently houses the foreign study
and women’s studies programs,
into a student residence. “Bruce
Hall,” Hughes said, “is out-of the
question until after the ’77 fall
term.”

The University currently has\a
contract with the Hotel Webster
Hall to provide temporary housing
for the student dverﬂow. But the
hotel, according to Hughes, may
begin its own renovation and “it is
assumed we will have to look
elsewhere for housing."

“We may very well be able to
renew. Webster Hall, but we can't
get a deﬁnite statement, . and

Presidential Candidates Speak C)ut

BY LISAARUBENST-EIN

Three candidates will wind up
their campaigns for Student Gov-
ernment president this week, and
13 hopefuls are seeking the six

ELECTVIONHP

board seats.
The three
Presidential
candidates are
Rich Gollub,
Stu Hausman
and Bernie
Payne.  1 .-
The Pitt News questioned each
presidential candidate on a variety
of issues of concern to students this
year, including revisions in the
structure of student government,
tuition-increases and priorities for
the coming year. (See pages 6 and
7 for interviews of the 13 board
candidates. )
Gollub, head of the Young
Socialist Alliance slate, said .stu-
dent government is not effective in

  

its present form, and should be‘
‘ expanded

to -provide a more
representative decision-making
body.

He sees the student government
as a political tool. “We should take
stands on political issues happen-
ing on campus—particularly issues
dealing with sexism and racism.
What I'm proposing is a more
politicalstudent government, and
I’m experienced in politics," he
said.

Fighting against a tuition hike
would be one of Gollub’s first
priorities, he said. His strategies
to involve student groups on
campus
other universities on a statewide
level.

He also is against departmental
cutbacks and racist and sexist
policies in the university.

Gollub said his priorities for
allocation of the student activities
fee would depend on the students,
explaining he would use referen-
dums and surveys to determine
student priorities. Gollub said
daytime programming should be a

and organization with '

RICHGOLLUB
priority in order to serve the needs
of the majority of off-campus
students.

Hausman, a member of Zeta
Beta Tau fraternity, said the chief
problem with this year's board was
its inability to use its power. He
said Student Government should
be better publicized and requires
more input from students.

One of Hausman’s proposals to
increase student interest would be
to have the Board meetings in the
‘Student Union Ballroom and
provide microphones for students
to make their comments known to
the board.

Hausman is also calling for a
decentralization of the allocations
system to allow students to
self-allocate one-fourth of their
activites fee to any group on
campus. The other three-fourths of
the fee would be allocated by the
Allocations Committee.

He supports lobbying as the key
to combat tuition hikes, and said
the students need to approach the
administration and work with them
to achieve higher state aPPT0l31'ia~
tions. . He said SGB should also
correspond with other student
governments and create a state-
wide organization.

STUHAUSMAN

Hausman cited commuter prob-
lems, specificially working out a
plan to alleviate some of the
problems of parking tickets and
neighbor problems that face many
fraternities in North Oakland.

Payne, a former member of the
Black Action Society steering
committee and" a member of the
Student Government Legal Aware-
ness Committee and Senate Ath-
letic Committee, said Student
government needs to get in touch
with other student groups to which
it has not been sensitive in the
past.

In order to help student
government “get in touch," Payne
said,—he would support the Student
Government revisions proposed by
SGB President Barry Weisband,
which include mechanisms for an
advisory assembly with represen-
tatives from all student groups-.

Payne said st-udent government
should re-open the lines of

communication between it and
other student groups, and make
better use of its seats on the
University Senate committees.

In order to successfully ﬁght a
tuition increase at Pitt, SGB should
use letters and phone campaigns to

BERNIE PAYNE

indicate to legislators how students
feel, Payne said. Y -
Paynestated his priorities would
include aiding the fraternities with
their neighbor problems and
re-establishment of the Commuter
Association with the emphasis on
services such as carpools and
parking. He also supports more
involvement by students in the
surrounding community.

His priorities for the allocation of
the student activities ‘fee would
include higher allocations to those
groups that touch the largest group
of people; Fraternities, Sororities,
Resident Student Association,
Black Action Society. Engineers
and Nurses.

SGB President—Aside from being a

“We're not trying to penalize
Lothrop students." Hughes said.
“We need to equalize space. We
would like to. keep the recreation
and programming space, but
compared to other dorms, Lothrop
is overlounged," he said. b
Holland Hall has four triple
rooms on each floor between the
third and tenth floors. The largest

triple on each ﬂoor, in terms of ~

square footage, will be converted
into quad arrangements with

movable modular furniture and

carpeting.

CAS Adopts
New Frosh

Help Plan

BY JOSEPH HAYDEN
The College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) Council recently adopted
a resolution to assure
guidance and assistance placement

for incoming freshmen requiring

academic help.

According to the resolution,
enrollment trends in past years
have resulted in the admission of
many CAS students who need
considerable guidance and aca-
demic assistance.

“Basically, I feel this is a fair and

operational resolution,’.’ CAS Dean By

Robert Marshall said. “We want to
assure placement of these students
in appropriate skills programs,” he
said.

The resolution stressed CAS
Council should -“recognize the
special needs of many students for
guidance and assistance beyond
that which is now available.”

tions and the appointing of

Hughes, which will be converted to
a double room.

The housing office’s plans for
McCormick involve ‘partitioning
two-level suites on the second,
fourth. sixth and eighth floors to
make room for four additional
students in each. The apartment
style rooms currently house an
average of six students, according
to Hughes. _, .
4 Most of the area to . be
partitioned, he said, is currently
used as a lounging area.

Each new room will have its own
door and will be partitioned so that
no one has to enter through
an—other's room, Hughes said. The
apartments’ stairwells will also be
screened off to ensure further
privacy. 5

Each year the housing office
turns away at least 200 applicants
for Universityhousing due tolack
of facilities, Hughes said. Yet the

, dorm crunch is expected to dwindle

in the future, he said. Thus,
building a new dorm would not be
necessary.

Our SGB Endorsement

The size and quality of the ﬁeld of candidates running for Student
Government Board is a disappointment. But that is no reason to not
endorse anybody. Therefore the Pitt News decided upon the best
presidential candidate and top four board hopefuls. But those endorsed
mustn’t misconstrue endorsement and election as a mandate.

Students must still watch the winners and make sure that they do
morethanlive up to their campaign promises. They must prodthem into
effective leadership, and not let them idly collect the remuneration
checks.

For students who do can sit back and watch anotherwasted year goby.

The Pitt News, after interviewing every ofﬁcial candidate, and both
ofﬁcial write in candidates, endorses the following people:

SGB Meni)ers—JoAme Levison, Ahnie Baum, Josh Baylson, and
(lip Hubbard. V

The Pitt News does not consider these people to be the ones to have
the complete answer to what is needed for student government. But of
the thirteen running, these people have at least the right attitude.

It is far better to endorse these four than no one at all- For With the
pitifully tiny  of candidates entered it would be easy for seven
candidates of little caliber to be elected instead of them.

Like his two opponents. Bemie Payne khews exactly What he Wants t°
do. But in addition, he knows exactly where to go and to see to tghet
things accomplished. He has a rapport with the admimstratlon that e
other two would take the ﬁrst few months to acquire. fﬁ .81

JoArme Levison is avery articulate woman who has been the uno ci

spokesperson for the commuters——a group who have been without voice

for months She demonstrated a willingness to take on thankless tasks
,1 ast D mmb‘ ' er when she co-ordinated emergency carpools for students
during the Port Authority strike-

Ahmie Baumis a fresh face with a head full of new ideas. It’s these
ideas, and a demonstrated willingness to carrythem out that can provide
the Board the direction it has needed for the past thirty-odd months.

Even though he was a member of the nearsighted 1976 Allocations
Committee, Josh Baylson would still contribute much to the‘Student
Government Board. He is very sensitive to most student needs. Baylson
was one of the hardest working members of the food co-op, the brightest
achievement of. the Weisband regime. V

Chip Hubbard seeks an unprecedented third student government
term. He has demonstrated an ability to work a project through. to
completion—an ability most members of the present admimstration
lack. He has a complete understanding of Pitt bureaucracy and knows
how to use it to get things done.

The P!ttNews urges the student body to get out and vote for the above

. ﬁve, thenchart the new Board’s course carefully, for although much

political hay has been made recently concerning student input, we’ve
heard it all before.

Students should also remember that another way to foster
representative government isto vote forbothreferendathis week. Ifthe
constitution is so amended, student govermnent stands a better chance
to gain that input it lacked from various student groups.

Forgiving and Admitting

An era ended Friday when President Carter issued a blanket pardon to .

draft evaders of the Vietnam war. This country is now one chapter‘ closer
to closing the book that was undoubtedly a terrible mistake.

Once the U.S. gets a complete accounting for all missing in action this
will all be over. But in closing the book one can’t let it collect dust-it

niust be a reference book to insure that Vietnam never happens again. . ’

Opponents argue that to bring these people back is an insult to
families who lost sons on Southeast Asian battleﬁelds. But it is easy to-
blame those nearer to, usthan a government -and its leaders—-for they
sent sons to their death, not the draft evaders.

To bringthembackisto admit America made a mistake. But to admit ‘
a mistake is the ﬁrst step to take to prevent one from happening again.

  

  The Reporter As ’Honk3/

BY TOM WASELESKI

Langley Hall was not my first
encounter with a fatal explosion. An
aunt of mine was destroyed in the
McKeesport Hospital blast ‘five
years ago. I can still remember
hearing the radio report; how it
described the injuries, how one
person was in critical condition.

Then, in the next report, maybe

‘15 minutes later, I heard her
name—dead, the voice said—and it

was the strangest of feelings. I was _

less horriﬁed at the thought of my
aunt being killed than I was of the
fact that someone I knew was being
written up in death as a news item at
.some impersonal wire service desk.
And so it was last Thursday when
Jimmy Carter shook hands on the

 inaugural

A People's
BY JOE AIJKNICZYK

WASHINGTON—I stood on the
grounds of the Capitol building,
shivering in the cold, listening to

Jimmy Carter. His soft and
hesitating, yet conﬁdent tones
ﬂoated back to me from the
loudspeaders. A

“Two centuries ago our nation's
birth was milestone in the long
quest for freedom, but the bold and
brilliant dream which excited the
founders of this nation still awaits
its consummation. I have no new
dream to set forth today, but rather
urge a fresh faith in the old
dream." i

The people surrounding me,
listening to his inaugural address.
seemed to be out of some
second-rate whodunit: black and
white, young and old, men and
women. business suits and blue
jeans. Some cheered when he said
the United States was a strong
nation and that he would keep it
strong; others cheered when he
called for the complete elimination
of nuclear weapons.

Many of the people there had

 

TV screen after his inaugural
address and suddenly the Student
Union windows vibrated with the
sound of a light sonic boom. We
gazed out, saw nothing, and
someone joked, “Probably the
angel of death.” Talk about irony.

IMPRESSIONS

On hearing the news over the
phone a minute later, we raced over
to Langley and soon were ankle
deep in snow, questioning ﬁre

officials, eyewitnesses and vice,

chancellors. Hundreds in the street
stood horriﬁed, and I immediately
recognized _the mangled rubble of

green between Clapp and Craw-
ford. The tables had turned, as they

worked for his election, all seemed
willing now to give him their trust.
“You have given me a great
responsibility-to stay close to you,
to be worthy of you, and to
exemplify what you are. Let us
create together a new national
spirit of unity and trust. Your
strength can compensate for my
weakness, and your wisdom can
help to minimize my mistakes.”
Later, I watched as he walked up
Pennsylvania Avenue, holding
hands with his wife, Rosalynn, both
of them smiling and waving to the
crowds. The rumor that he was
walking had carried through the
crowd ahead of him, and when we
could see that it was true the crowd
cheered and applauded wildly. I
heard a few people worry aloud
about his safety, and I guess’ we all
privately harbored such fears, but
there were no incidents; indeed,
not even any demonstrations

against him. He was greeted only A

with love and happiness and
cheering.

That night, at the inaugural
party for the Georgians and
Minnesotans. he said that he had

say, and instead of being on the kin
side of the victim, I was supposed to

play the role of a hard-nosed,’

detached media monger, the kind
that thrives on disaster reporting,
subsists on death and corruption,
gets high on the shrieks of
victimized young women in dark
alleys.

There was a fire last week in the
city and 15 people were left
homeless. One of the local TV
stations showed its young, hand-
some, white male reporter eagerly
thrusting the mike in‘ front of a
wailing, .now-homeless black
woman. In what may have been a
Brooks Brothers suit, he more than
aptly executed his job, asking
simply, “How does it feel? What
will you do now?” Almost breaking
the embrace V a comforting friend
had on her, she snapped, “How do
you think it feels?!”

I almost wished she would’ve
added, “Honkyl”

Racism is hardly necessary for
the reporter’s role as honky. While
city editors clamor for that human
interest element, it’s the reporter as
honky who must go out and
ruthlessly prostitute himself before
miserable next of kin, acting as
though death were as routine as
flushing a toilet: now he’s here,
now he’s gone.

After a while, I’m told by V

veterans, you become used to
inflicting such brutal questions;
besides, it’s your job and it sells
papers.

The reporter as honky swarmed
over the Langley site, in and out of
the mob, over the rubble, seeking
moans, and jumping in the backs of
ambulances. He snapped photos of
weeping kin and stunned class-
mates. He played a macabre tape
recording of the explosion over the
six o'clock news in an effort to boost
ratings. ‘

Yet there were other reporters

' thatwent about themselves a bit

more humanistically Thursday.
Because inside just about each one
of us was the humbled feeling, “It
could’ve been me, man, it could’ve
been me.”

SGB Round-up

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Editor’s Note: All 13 of this
year’s Student Government Board
[SGB] candidates were interviewed
last weekend by the Pitt News.

They were asked to respond to
many issues including student

‘government revisions, tuition hikes

and their priorities for the coming
year. ‘

Following, in alphabetical order,
are capsule summaries of the
candidates’ views:

MICHAEL BATES

Bates, an ofﬁcial write-in candi-
date, recently withdrew his second
appeal which caused the postpone-
ment of the election. He said he did

‘ not have anyone to represent him.

Bates said if elected his priorities

would be to increase interaction

between students and student
government via a telephone service
and by moving the board meetings
to the Student Union lower lounge.

He also said one of his priorities

would be to help the heads of any
campus organization to be remun-
erated if they can demonstrate the
amount of time and work they do is
worthwhile.

Although he said students don’t
have the power to ﬁght a tuition
hike, he said the effects could be
softened through open “conversa-
tion” with Pitt’s lobbyist in
Harrisburg. _

He also would like to reduce
student problems with the campus
police,and improve dorm security.

He would not encourage political
action by student government,
unless students bring the matter to
the board.

AHMIE BAUM

Baum suggested the way to
provide a more effective student
government is to develop “project-
ive thinking.”

“Every year there are new ideas
that are lost when the board
members leave. We must keep in
mind guidelines for future boards.”

He cited this as one way for
students to deal more effectively

with the administration, “They
already use projective thinking and
are always that much ahead of us.”

He also stressed students should
be educated about the services
provided by student government. If
elected, he plans to use the Legal

' Awareness Committee to help solve

many problems faced by commu-
ters. He would also like to see the
reinstitution of the carpool program
established during the Port Author-
ity Transit strike.

Baum said the student govern-
ment does not have the support
necessary to effectively combat a
tuition hike, although in time,
through long term planning,
student government could be
effective. He also supports
revisions in the structure of student
government.

. ‘ JOSH BAYLSON

Baylson said the student gov-

ernment in its present form is not .

working although he stressed “the
philosophy with the Student Gov-
ernment Board now is probably the
problem.”

He said, student government
should primarily act as a service
organization for students. Student
government has to show people
tangible activities, Baylson said.

Some of his ideas and priorities
for the year would be working with
the Pennsylvania Student Lobby
and the Commonwealth Student
Lobby to help hold down tuition;
improving the student government
co-op, establishing better relations
with the campus police by using the
services of the Legal Awareness
committee and the development of a
campus police substation on lower
campus. ,

Baylson, a member of the
Allocations Committee this year
said his experience on that
committee will help him work as a
board member, explaining his
experience can help him implement
his ideas.

He also supports the referendum

 

MICHAEL BATES

AHMIE BAUM

and would encourage the develop-
ment of an executive council from
the assembly to work with the seven
board members '

STEPHEN GUIDAS

Guidas, an engineer and a dorm
student saidlhe felt those interests
should be represented on the board.

His priorities for the upcoming
year, if elected, would be to work to
“please the students” and go to
students to find out what they want.

Guidas said he had no priorities
for the Allocations Committee.
Guidas said he would “play things
by ear” although the activities fee
should be allotted according to the
number of students in each group.

He said he would not fight against
a “justifiable tuition hike," if the

cutbacks could be made without,

sacrificing a quality education.

Guidas supports the referendum,
and said organizations would be the
key to obtaining more student
input. ~

JOSH BAYLSON

 

DAVE HESIDENCE

Hesidence, a former member of
the Allocations Committee is

running for student government 

because “I see a lot of things going
on around campus that don’t agree
with me.”

In his view, the present structure
of student government isn’t work-
ing. ‘ ‘It isn’t responsible and it isn’t
visible to students.” He supports
the referendum because it will give
the board more input.

His long range priorities and
goals include more cohesion among
students and an executive council

that would represent major groups ”' "

added to the proposed advisory
assembly. .

He would like to see the Student
Government Board move its
meetings somewhere more access-
ible to students in order to get input.
He would also like to implement a
research committee under the

board to gather public opinion. One
other‘ improvement would be a
hearing procedure, like that in the
U.S. Congress to have students and
administrators to speak on issues.
He said his priorities for the
allocations committee would be
more student services, program-
ming and “groups that have a
meaningful inpact on students.”

CHIP HUBBARD

Hubbard, a second term incum-
bent said the structure of student
government needs to be changed,
and said. “I think the only way to
get it to work is to set it up by
schools.”

Hubbard cited his record as a two

term member of the board, and said‘

his re—election will guarantee the
further success of his ideas.

His plans include an information
research center that includes career
outlooks for the future and provides
professional counselors. Hubbard
said he would like to expand. this
center and increase its publicity.

center is one of his projects, he said,
and he would like to see it continue.

He cited as his major accomplish-
ment this year the successful
alleviation of the Audiovisual
charge for students and student
groups. _

Hubbard said his priorities for
this year include the re-establish-
ment of student lobbies to ﬁght
tuition hikes, the compilation of a
booklet on student aid, re-estab-
lishment of the campus escort
system,» and re-institution of the
Student Affirmative Action Com-
mittee under the Ofﬁce of Student
Affairs.

JON KATZ

Jon Katz is a member of the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions, The Gaming Club, and a
member of Pi Lambda Phi.

“Student government hasn’t
lived up to its potential because of
the lack of communication,” Katz
said. He supports the referendum
providing for the revisions of
student government, although he
said the assembly should be given
more than advisory responsibilities,
it should be given the power to
recall unpopular decisions and
impeach board members not living
up to their jobs.

He said lobbying would be one
way of forestalling a tuition hike

JON KATZ.

although “for student government
to become an effective lobbying
force it needs student support.”
.Katz proposed the establishment
of a student survey committee to

‘help increase the knowledge the

board has of what students want.

His priorities in the coming year
would be to help increase the range
of student services provided by
student government.

ROBERT KUREY, JR.

Kurey, a member of Sigma Chi,
said the biggest thing student
government did not do this year is
get student groups involved. He
pointed to the BAS protest of
Student Government as an ex-
ample.

“We need independent and fair
leadership,” Kurey said.

Kurey had no comment on the
upcoming referendum on student
government revisions but said,
“the larger groups are, the more
power you give out, the less chance
you have for it to be diversiﬁed and
the less chance it has to work.”

He said as a board member-he
would make sure he knew what
other students want by going to
their organizational meetings.

Kurey said he did not think
student government has the power
right now to combat a tuition hike,
stressing the need to get the
community’s support in order to
influence state legislators.

JOANNE LEVISON

Joanne Levison, a member of the
College Republicans and the\
Commuter Committee of Student
Government said student govern-
ment should get off the third ﬂoor
and try to locate in an area more
accessible to students in order to
achieve more interaction with
students. ’

Levison said students should
make more use of student services
like the health service. To combat a
likely tuition hike this year, Levison
proposed ﬁghting on the state level.
If students had a lobbying force in
Harrisburg-not just for tuition, but
for tax credits for tuition, and higher
ﬁnancial aid, it would help us.”

Levison said Commuters should
be a priority for the new student
government. “There should be a
booklet for commuters similar to
that prepared for resident students
that is a comprehensive compilation
for commuter stu-
dents.”

    

CI/.E0 SUMPTER

According to Sumpter, student
government is not doing what it
should for students. ‘ ‘It needs to be
restructured and the meetings
should be more open.”

Sumpter said the reason the
board does not have much input
from students is because student
government is too closed.

R KEY, JR.

Sumpter supports the student
government revisions although she
suggested instead of an advisory
board there should be representa-
tive of all student organizations on
the Board’s agenda.

Sumpter said one of her priorities
would be to let students know about
student government although she
said “it’s going to be hard to get
students interested in going to
meetings.” '

“We don’t need anymore new
ideas, we need to work on the old
ones to strenghten them,” she said
when asked about her plans for the
next year if elected.

Sumpter said the allocations
committee should be revised,
because there are not representa-
tives of each organization on the
committee. She proposed a change
putting representatives of large and
small organizations on the com-
mittee “so the people on the
Allocations Committee can get an
insight into the organizations.”

SALLY SHOUP

Shoup, a write-in candidate
running on a Young Socialist
Alliance slate with Presidential
candidate Rich Gollub would like to

push for more political stands by
Student Governm t and would

JOANNELEVISON

seek to involve students in ﬁghting
a tuition hike, cutbacks in

‘departmental programs, racist and

sexist policies in the university and
for political awareness outside the
University like South Africa.

Shoup said in order to mobilize
students she would use teach-ins,
demonstrations and picket lines.

She said this year the student
mobilization would be bé'é';uS‘e‘1t
than last year’s efforts becuase of
more publicity. “It will start to
build momentum, and when it starts
hitting the administration where it

hurts, it will get results.”

Her priorities for the year would
include ﬁghting against a tuition
hike, working"with other student
organizations, holding referendums
andiquestionnaires to ﬁnd out what
students - want.

GARY TWEED AND
MICHAEL TOSHOK

Tweed and Toshok are running on
a slate because their “views
complement each other and it would
be ridiculous to run in. competi-
tion.”

Tweed was appointed to the
Board after Sue Turner’s resigna-
tion last year.

They support lobbying in Harris-
burg, in combination with other
state and state-related universities
to combat a tuition hike. Toshok
also said the decision making
processes of the administration are
usually made when fewer students
are around and, “the administra-
tive decisions affecting students
should be made when _ more
students are around.”

Tweed said there should be
changes in the structure of the
student government and supported
revisions which would include an
advisory assembly. Tweed criti-
cized this year’s student govern-
ment because there “was not
enough personal contact following

up contacts made with students and
student organizations.’ ’

Toshok emphasized the need for
student government to be more
responsive through meetings open
to all students during the day so
more students could attend.

“The only way student govern-
ment can iaffectively run is if
students give input,” Toshok said.
He also advocatedtproviding 3-5

year plans to give future boards to‘

establish long range planning in
student government.

Tweed, an incumbent, pointed to
“the things I’ve done on the board
through personal contacts”.as one
of his strong points, although he
said “when I came to the board the
policies were already set.” He
stressed his work with the
diagnostic clinic, and the complaint
center this year. ’

Toshok said the board should
avoid setting its goals beyond its
reach. ~

Tweed and Toshok want to
approach commuter problems,

ernment and lobbying in the coming

BY  GAYSEK3 T j 

There has been a lot said recently
about what some people call the
cruel, inhumane’, uncivilized and
barbaric sport of hunting. No one
will argue that there are not more
sick and sadistic animal torturers
out there'than we'd like to think

about, but is that what hunters are

about?

Do they all worship guns and
drool at the sight and scent of
blood? Last Saturday was the last
day of the “second” hunting season
for small game and most other
hunted animals.) Frank and

limits may thinktthey live. in a
teeming and cosmopolitan metro-
polis, any hunter knows that all he

has to do is travel no more than 25 '

miles along any radius from the
Point to get lost in thick underbrush
and wild environs.

There is good hunting in every
direction outside of Pittsburgh. The

relatively ﬂat land of the Ohio
' valley, the thick brush and rolling

hills to the south, the wild and crazy
farmland just east of Monroeville.

i .At seven o’clock in the morning, I
really don’t care too much about the '

‘reason, but the good-natured

banter adds warmth to the. cab of
Frank's Datsun pickup as we head
north along Rt. 19.

“When it’s cold and snowy like
this. it really doesn't matter where
you go. Especially during second

season is ovc: cow, and Frank and
Wayne each have failed in getting a
buck, so they've decided to give
small game one more try.

Stalking Wild Game In Pa.

(Continuezl from Page 8)

Frank has been hunting for 13 of
his 25 years and pretty much knows
what kind of luck he’ll have on any
given day with any given condi-
tions. “During this second season,
the only animals open are rabbits,
grouse and squirrel and they

generally like to stay in their holes .

and nests and hide themselves.”

“Hunting’s always better during
the first season,” Frank says,
downshifting as we bounce along
the ice-rough road. The wipers slap
snow back and forth on the
windshield and the guns and the
hunting jackets back in the camper
jump from side to side. “It’s
usually not ‘so cold, and pheasants
are in season, too.”

“Yeah. The animals seem to be
lesssuspicious of hunters and are
less likely to run when they hear us
coming,” agreed Wayne. Wayne is
a 26-year-old baggage handler for
Eastern Airlines. This is his ﬁrst
year hunting small game.

Frank and Wayne discuss a wide
range of topics during the hour-long
ride. The heater takes a while to
warm up and their conversation is
punctuated with puffs of thin white
vapor.‘

Twenty-two miles north of
Pittsburgh, just between Wexford
and Zelienople, is Baldinger’s Food

tugging at a sleeve. Whatever you

decide on, you have to spend the

whole day with so it had better be
comfortable.”

A list of clothing suggestions for
the novice hunter includes at least
two pairs of socks, a suit of long
underwear, some ﬂannel shirts-—
which are not only warm, but also
help the hunter ﬁt the usual
stereotype, a pair of hunting
pants-——usua1ly made from canvas
or stiff cotton duck, and a canvas
hunting jacket with a rubberized
game bag, large pockets and
webbing to hold shotgun shells.

Good hunters should have two
kinds of boots; one pair of insulated
leather for when the weather is
warm and dry, and another pair of
rubber “pac” boots with an acrylic
pile lining for when the weather is
cold and wet.

A hat and gloves, preferably of a
fluorescent orange material for
visibility, also are advisable.

Wayne and Frank take one step
into the ﬁeld before they open the
breeches of their guns to load. State
law requires them to be off the road
with loaded weapons. “You never
know when a game warden might
happen along,” says Frank.
“Believe me, they do patrol areas
like this, even though it seems like
an impossible job.”

, Frank shoves three shells into his
father’s 80-year-old Remmington-
12-gauge while Wayne totes the
16-gauge Ithica pump he borrowed
from Frank. The guns are light
enough———the Remmington is the
heavier at 15 pounds——but after a
couple of hours, their weight seems
to triple.

Frank nods to Wayne and they
walk slowly down the slope of the
field. Snow reaches up over their ~

boot tops and hugs their calves.

“Whooee!” Wayne yells. “This
is some deep snow!”

‘‘It always seems to snow more
out here than in town,” Frank says.
“When Pittsburgh gets two or three
inches like last night, you can count
on half-a-foot out here.”

We take it easy going down the
hill, all three of us taking turns
slipping every few steps. Even if we
did see anything, Ihave no idea how
either of them could keep their
balance long enough to shoot.”

The field funnels down into a
valley with a frozen-over creek
guarded by small crabapple trees.
Frank misjudges a step and cracks
through the thin ice, but the rubber
boots keep his feet warm and dry.
He takes a few steps further and
squats.

“See. Here, look at this,” he
says pointing at a hole creek bank.
“Rabbit tracks... going in, but none
coming out. Just as I thought.
They’re probably all holed up.”

“They’re wise to us Wayner,”
Frank says smiling. “They do all
their ‘messing around before
sun-up, then sneak back to their
holes and read the paper or watch
T.V. or laugh their tails off at us
freezing ours off looking for them!’ ’

“What do you think about
grouse?” Wayne asks with his gun
laying across his shoulders like the
soldiers in the newsreels wading
through the rice paddies.

“I don’t know. Probably the
same story. It’s too damn cold for
anything to be out. Except for
pheasants,” Frank answers, rub-

bing his reddened nose with his

gloved hand.
“Naturally. We can't shoot‘
them, so we’ll see a million

pheasants.’_’

advertisement on tarantulas. The
idea appealed to him so he bought
one and named it Valium because
“she acts like she’s depressed.”

How he identified the spider’s sex is
beyond me—l wouldn’t get close
enough—but Valium lives in an
aquarium and her owner handles
her with gloves.

Asked if he would ever go into the
tarantula breeding business, the
owner said he doubted it because
female tarantulas kill the male after .
mating unless “you get them apart
real quick.”

During her time in the residence
halls, Valium ate only mealworms,
not people, and gradually neighbors
on the floor got used to the spider.

Its owner said that having a
tarantula “just seemed interesting.
I always liked strange animals.”
However, he says his next pet will
“probably be a dog.”

Sure, I suppose I could become
attached to a plant or a teddy bear,
but there’s something about a pet, .
be it crabs or gerbils or even a
tarantula, that a cactus or
Winnie-the—Pooh doll can’t come
close to duplicating.

Picking, Strumming Hartford

BY KEITH SRAKO\ClC

Bluegrass and good times pick
their way into the overﬂow crowd in
the Student Union Lower Lounge.
Foot stomping, knee slapping fans

. are primed by a West Virginia band

called Hickory Wind and a singer
named John Hartford.

» Hickory Wind blows a warm
breeze over the audience from a
glowing yellow stage with the likes
of “Beaumont Rag” and “Ragtime
Annie,’.’ lively square dance tunes
that prompt some of the energetic
to take it upon themselves to
“swing -their partners” and
“promenade on home."

The band, made up of ﬁve
talented musicians who play a
plethora of instruments" (banjoes,
violins, mandolins, guitars, bass,
electric piano, hammer dulcimer
and flute, to mention a few) also

harmonize, as in a purely vocal-

song they refer to as “a hunting
and drinking song, or really, a
drinking and hunting song” that
deals with the trials and tribula-
tions of a frantic hare eluding
beer-infested poachers. V

The Wind is slowing down and
sliding ‘into a heavy dulcimer
song with a Rumanian name

loosely interpreted as “Where’s‘

the Bathroom?” But the two
ﬁddles ﬂanking it are really doing
some ﬁddling—ﬁddling with the
heads of everyone. V

The encore, “Sweatsock (The
Orange-Blossom Special),” brings
even more life to an already

enthusiastic group in that slow,
momentum—building way this clas-
sic has, ﬁnally reaching a velocity
Amtrak would be proud of.

During a ten-minute recess the
stagehands bring a sheet of
plywood on stage, front and center,
lay it flat and set 'a single
microphone on it while the
sharp-featured, long-haired Hart-
ford tunes his instruments.

The house lights darken and a
single spot shines on a sole
performer, John Hartford, ﬁddle
under chin, bow in hand, starts
slowly and picks up to the tempo of
a bluegrass violin solo, then slows
down a little and starts to dance
around. His feet are not merely
keeping time or carried away by the
music, they're making it. The
violin has stopped and the hall is
ﬁlled with the sound of hard leather
on wood, hundreds of feet
stomping cue the next performer:
his voice. Not singing, not
speaking, but the man’s mouth is
emitting sounds that evoke delight

  

Studio's ’T rial’: Hope,
‘ Potential And Kafka

BY RON NYSWANER

Immediately there is the feeling
of being an outsider. People toss
private jokes back and forth.
Others, busy nailing parts of the set
together, taking another section
apart, adjusting costumes, testing
state lights, or giving orders, look at
the stranger, wonder who he is, and
cautiously say ‘ ‘hello. ’ ’

   

A “dress parade” is in progress:
the cast stands on the stage in full
costume and make-up while direc-
tor David Lear looks on. He asks
one actor to roll on the floor to make
his shirt dirtier, then he walks down
and adjusts another player’s hat.
Minor changes certainly, but Lear
and the cast can see a difference.

Pictured are four of the creators of Studio Theatre’s The Trial, Ira
Sarver, Michael Burke, David Lear, and Marion Krell. The production
begins Tuesday, January 25, and runs through January 29. »

None of this is to mean that the
cast and crew of Studio Theatre’s
soon-to-be-produced Trial are un-
friendly. Their attitude says
instead: “We are working hard
here, with little time left, working
on something we care about very

~ much.”

notes. I

Franz Kaﬂca’s The Trial, adapted
for the Studio Theatre by .Michael
Burke, is about aman who wakes
me morning to find that he isunder
arrest, without explanation, without
being taken to prison. ‘Joseph K.,
the main character, must prove he
is innocent and ﬁnally, justify his
existence.

“I had to decide,” Lear leans to
say, “how to make this interpreta-
tion work.’ It needed movement,
and personality.”

Burke’s adaptation departs from

typical interpretations of The Trial

and a touch of crazy melody. With
that, he introduces his band-——his
hands. his feet and his voice.

Switching to banjo, he picks and
strums the story of the “Judai
Belle,” the fastest riverboat ever
seen, even known to have beaten
the Delta"Queen. He creates the
tempo change of the race with two
instruments; his shoes, His next
tune is the first of many humorous
offerings. “Don't Leave Your
Records in the Sun" tells of the
way records wrinkle line prunes in
heat. The key to the quality here is
the way Hartford plays his voice,
by having it make the sounds that
such a distorted disc might make
upon playing-

From the cool of the cyan-soaked
stage John dissolved into the
depths of a balladeer singing of the
life of a frustrated ofﬁce worker in
“High Towers” while tapping and
picking the notes on his guitar.
Switching back to the ﬁddle, the
voice the violin sings softly as

using his hands on a guitar in a way

Again Hartford approaches his
audience with ridiculous humor:

groans a few phrases, uses the
violin to grunt a little and promptly

Ballet Innovative Fantasies

BY DENISE DAILEY

Saturday evening with . the
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre at Heinz

~Hall offered a colorful, varietyiof

dances to suit both modern and

, traditional tastes. .

The ﬁrst piece, “Spectre de la
Rose,” was -for the hardcore
traditionalists, with a lofty set and
conventional costumes. Along with
a love for old-style ballet, one also

appreciate this story of a woman’

who, upon returning from a ball
with a rose in her hand, falls asleep
and dreams that the ghost of the

rose is dancing with her.

Even for those willing to be
carried along in the young ‘girl's
dream, the task was difficult. The

rose was danced by Thierry Dorado,
whose technique lacks both the
gracefulness of a long-stemmed
rose and the ethereal quality of a
woman’s dreams.

Although his leaps and turns
were well-executed and impressive.
they were not ﬁnely woven into the

choreographic fabric of the dance,

and tended instead to punctuate the
whole like scattered exclamation
points.

But the same disjointedness that
distracted from his portrayal of the

rose enhanced his performance as _

the half-comic, half-tragic puppet in
the featured ballet, ‘ ‘Petrouchka. ’ ’

“Petrouchka” . is. the story of
three puppets—the Ballerina, the
Moor and the clownish Petrouchka

 When Rembrandts Are

Cunliffe presents prints of dots
and thin lines separately in primary
colors in relation to dictates of
equations. Using such equations,
he rotates dots and lines within
rows of squares, plotting ‘out
optimal color and spatial relation-'
ships. These relationships change
row by row, determined by the
displacement effects of the equa-
tion he uses within each print, and
within the series.

The viewer is fascinated with the
intricate, minute, yet dynamic
changes forced on his elements by
his formulas. It's marvelous how a
slight displacement effects a tightly
collared but dramatic change
between his dots in row one and the
bottom line.

This is what fascinates their
improvisor, too. But the far

impressed with how well the‘

compared. The authentic costumes

performers’ high energy level,
provided the audience with a
continually interesting and colorful H

The most exciting piece of the
evening was the world premiere of
“Fantasia.” This modern ballet
brought together the works of
several artists to create an event
unique to contemporary ballet.

The backdrop to the work is a 35-

(Continued from Page 12
which sees it as the process of
Joseph K.’s alienation from the
important and familiar things in his
life-—from life itself.

Burke sees something “more
than alienation” in Kafka’s work.

He finds an element of hope—hope ’

in the potential of the individual.

“Michael ’ s interpretation intro-
duced the introspective moods of
K.,” Lear says. To physicalize
these introspections, added to the
script by Burke as interior
monologues, Lear and co-director
Marion Krell created a shadow-
player. This silent character
(played by Krell), whitefaced and
dressed in black, moves to music as
Joseph K (played by Keith Hoovler,
also the set designer) offers the
monologues.

The directors use music, with
darkness, and open space, as well
as some fully constructed sets with
complete furnishings, to help divide
the play between realistic and
impressionistic theatre. As Hoovler
says when talking about the set he
created, the production tries to
make “the real things of the theatre

alive, while making the real room
(Joseph K.’s, the most completely
built part of the set) a lie.”

This division between real and
symbolic worlds is one of the
abstractions Burke is trying to
dramatize. Kafka’s book, heavily
symbolic and stylistic, certainly
leads to abstraction.

Burke has read many of Kafka’s
works as well as his letters. He,
with Lear, Krell and Ira Sarver, also
involved in the production, decided
which of Kafka’s concepts they
wanted to emphasize, and what,
perhaps, they wished to add.

’Fantasia’
In World
Premiere

/Continued from Page'IZ)
The climax of the dance is

extremely sexual, with the two men
reaching for her in turn, each
demanding the right to her body
and her soul.

A This struggle is set against the"

ominous presence of war embodied
in Dali’s painting. In the end, the
woman is torn apart.

What is striking about “Fan-
tasia” is the fact that works of art,
music and dance, noteworthy in
their own right, have been woven
together to create a rich texture and
strong impact. It is reminiscent of
the period of innovation in ballet in
Paris during the '20s and ’30s, when
Leonide Massine worked with
Picasso, Satie and others to blend
their various art forms into daring
works that challenged traditional
styles. It will be exciting to see if
Petrov and the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre continue their promising
innovation. ~

“We’ve gotten away from Kafka
in the sense that we are giving
human beings more credit than
Kafka would,” Burke says. “But
the essence—the nightmare-like
quality of Kaﬂ(a—-we’ve kept.”

Burke wants to make people
intellectualize; not to evoke emotion
—“to make people think.”

The Studio Theatre, for Burke, is
good for writers, and other artists as
well. “(It is) run by undergraduates
for undergraduates. There is lots of
potential here.”

When the rehearsal is over, Lear
plays back the comments he has
been making. Tired, the cast wants
to go home, but quietly they listen to
Lear, occasionally making their own
suggestions. For them, even at

midnight, it is important to learn
how the production can be made
better.

I leave almost unnoticed. The
people in the theater are concentra-
ting on Franz Kafka, on costumes,
lights, hand movements, props, and
characterizations. “Sorry to ignore
you,” they’ may have said, “but
these ideas, this play,is important
to us.” It is tempting to call them,
their abstractions, their symbols,
pretentions——if only all these things
hadn’t just become important to me
as well.

Joanne Shore, Thomas Caruso, and
David Barr, will join the small
mixed chorus.

The works of Mozart to be

word.” Again the adman leaves
himself an out.

Billy and Bobby have no such
loophole to climb through, however.
Their voices are nearly identical: a
tinny and high-pitched warmed-
over version of the Hudson
Brothers. Wait’ll they see how little
they make on this record, then one
of them will dump the other and
merely retrack his own voice to
achieve the alleged “brand of
harmony,” thus avoiding having to
split the take. ’

Needless to say there’s not a good
cut on the plastic, which brings us to
more creative uses for the album.

Youcan use it as a coaster for a

seem to have some kind of
mathematical proportion to them
that can be veriﬁed by measure-
ment afterwards. But, they said, to
plot. the composition mathe-
matically takes more time than to
simply do it free-hand, by eye and
instinct.

Conceivably, a computer could
be made to log out blue-prints of
perfect paintings, if fed equations
such as those Cunliffe uses.
Painting then would approach a
children’s kind of number-paint-
ing, in which the creator would not
have to be a Rembrandt or a

Rapheal to follow the lead of the‘

numbers to a perfect picture.
A fun idea, and certainly one ﬁt
for our standardized, computerized

‘society which is forever striving

towards the perfect “Product.”
Where would we be without the
awkward curve in the neck of
Botticel1i’s Venus? 1
It’s strange how the laws of

nature, despite a strict enforce— ‘

ment of the golden mean, do not
seem‘ stagnant to us. But a
computerization of that intangible
law instantly makes for brittle,
ﬂexible preversion of naturalness.
Admittedly, the prints of _Cun-
liffe in no way attempt to steal the
show from nature. But neither do
they make art. They are more a
representation of novel theories (or
laws) charted with paint and
frarr .d. But since it does relate to
art, a gallery is as good a place as
any to have them on view,
stimulating philosophical thought.

lcers Catch OU Short-H

 
 

Bill Gedeon [7] drove a close-in shot by the bewildered Ohio goalie for
Pitt’s first goal, while jubilant teammates swarmed Tom Sherwin after
his gamewinner in the Pitt invitational Tourney yesterday. Moss photos

BY JIM PANE
\Tom Sherwin scored a short-
handed goal late in the third period
yesterday to give the Pitt Hockey
Club a hard-fought 3-2 victory over
Ohio University in the champion-
ship of the third annual Pitt
Invitational Tournament at the Civic;
Arena.
In a game that saw 35 minutes in
penalties assessed, Sherwin broke a

2-2 deadlock that lingered since
early. in the second period by
beating Ohio‘ goalie Rob Smith on a
breakaway with 1:21 to play. The
Panther bench emptied to congrat-
ulate Sherwin, whose heroics gave
Pitt its second Invitational victory in
three tries.

Pitt beat New Church Academy,
8-2, Saturday, enabling it to
advance to the ﬁnals against an

Ohio team that entered the
tournament a better team than its
3-7 record might suggest.

A combination of injuries and
goalie problems have hampered
player-coach Doug Ross’ Bobcats
all year, but they easily won their
opening round game, 9-0, at the
expense of the junior varsity squad
from Penn State, who later beat
New Church, , 5-4, in Sunday’s
consolation game.

The penalty-plagued Pitt-Ohio
fiasco started with 1:01 gone in the
game when tempers ﬂared between
Panther Jeff Saunders and Ohio’s
John Menzies. They both made a
two-minute visit to a penalty box
that was occupied for much of the
first period’s 15 minutes.

The early rough play may have
rattled the Pantliers as Richard Pier
got credit for Ohio’s ﬁrst goal after a
mix up‘ in front of the Pitt goal.
Defenseman Rick Stein and goalie
Larry Newell couldn’t decide who
should clear a loose puck from the
crease, with it ﬁnally ﬁnding its way
past the"goal line at the 1:18 mark.

Bill Gedeon knotted the score at 

5:18, then set up the play that gave
Pitt a 2-1 lead when he stole the
puck along the left-wing boards and
scooted for the Ohio net with
linemate Tim Duffy following.
Gedeon forced Smith out of position
to the right and shoveled the puck
over to an open Duffy, who casually
lifted home his third goal of the
tournament at 13234 of the opening
period.

Vols Engineer Sweep

BY MARIA‘ SCIULLO

COLUMBUS-—Devastating is
one word often used to describe the
way in which the University of
Tennessee women’s track team
dismantles its opponents. The
Pantherettes found this out last
weekend as¥ they witnessed the
Volunteers sweep event after event
in the Ohio State Invitational. Pitt

-finished fifth—best of the eight
teams present.

‘ ‘Tennessee really was a superior
team,” admitted Pitt coach Mary
Ellen Shea. ‘ ‘But it was a good meet
for us, because everyone ran with
more, confidence than in our meet

- with Penn State and it showed in our

times,”

Sprinter Carol Gober agreed. “I
think we did well, despite the fact
that it was our ﬁrst meet on the
road,” she said.

‘Pitt’s best event of the day turned
out to be the 70-yard hurdles, where
both Sue Lewis and Michelle
Bressant won their preliminary
heats. In the ﬁnals, Lewis came in
second‘an'd Bressant placed fourth.
At the last minute, the three-mile
run was replaced by a two-mile race
in which Becky Falck ant; Kai-an
Cerutti finished third and sixth,
respectively.

Both Pantherette relay squads
were fourth. In the 880-yard relay,
Pam Shaw, Lisa /Sciullo, Michelle
Bressant and Janice Irwin ran
one-tenth of a second behind
Indiana State, while Tina Spivey,
Maria Sciullo, Bressant and Irwin
were edged out of third place in the
mile relay.

Individually, Irwin was sixth in
the 440 and Brenda Chorpenning
turned in one of herbest 880 times
this year for -sixth place. Shotputter
Gloria Linn’ succeeded likewise,
while long jumpers Shaw and Lisa
Sciullo were fifth and sixth,
respectively.

Although the OSUfacilities were
excellent, some of the Invitational
planning was not. The half-mile, for
example, was run with eleven

competitors in one cramped race,
prompting comments of ‘ ‘it was too
crowded” and “the judges had
some pretty strange rules.” The
more inexperienced distance run-
ners found themselves often boxed
in or blocked out during their
events.

Coach Freda Goff said she was
“pleased with the results of the

‘meet. Now the girls realize where

their weaknesses are, and hope-

fully, they can work on them.”

The ﬁnal team scoring went as
follows: University of Tennessee,
113 points; Indiana State, 39; Ohio
State, 38; ‘Eastern Michigan, 35;
Pitt, 25; Western Kentucky, 13;. and
Bowling Green and Wright State
tied with 6 points apiece.

This week, the team will prepare
for the January 29 Michigan State
Relays.

Providing a bright spot for the Pantherette tracksters at the Ohio State
Invitational this weekend was freshman Sue Lewis, who captured her
preliminary heat in the 70-yard hurdles, then finished second in the

ﬁnals.

After Ohio made it 2-2 in the
second frame, John Duricek
cross-checked Newell beside the
Pitt net, A retaliation on Newell’s
part. cost him a game misconduct
and his team a ﬁve-minute man
disadvantage.

Marty Bradley, who is undefeat-
ed in his last five games, replaced
Newell, picking upwhere he left off
in his brilliant performance against
New Church.

Bradley was tested early during
the ﬁve-minute man disadvantage,
but thanks to three shots that
harmlessly bounced off the goal

anded,

3-2

post and to the countless sliding‘

blocks by Rick Stein, the Panthers
killed the penalty and thwarted the
Ohio scorers the rest of the game.

The literal ‘game-saver, though,
came when Steve DiGiacomo broke
in all alone on Bradley, who made
an incredible pad save just minutes
before Sherwin put the game on ice.

“Gedeon passed it to me, the
goalie was on his knees, and I beat
him,” Sherwin said after the game.

“That’s the story,” Head Coach
Len Barcalow agreed. “That goalie

was down on his knees saying his I

‘Hail Marys,’ but he only got as far
as the ‘Hail.’ ” '

Panther goalie Larry Newell, later replaced by subsequent hero Marty
Bradley after the former was ejected, sprawls to make a first period save
in Pitt’s 3-2 win over Ohio University which raised the Panthers to a 7-1-1

record.

Panthers T umed Red 
By Orangemen, 96-74 -

BY CRIS HALL

SYRACUSE—Not even Wayne
Williams’ lucky cherry siuckercould
stop the Orange. V "

Nor could an unexpectedly strong

Panther showing in the ﬁrst 13 ,

minutes under Syracuse’s Manley
Dome Saturday night, and the
result was Pitt’s 20-18 lead being
turned into a 96-74 further
discoloration of its record.

Scoring streaks by Syracuse’s
Jim ,Wi1liams, Larry Kelley and
Dale Shackleford quickly and
consistently putito rest any Panther
upset hopes as the Orangemen
(14-2) used a 57.4-percent shooting
night to offset any lingering affects
Williams’ pre-game lollipop might
have had on the contest.

Williams came to New York in
different battle gear than that which
had failed him in Philadelphia a
week earlier. A grape confection-
on-a-stick had preceeded a 21-point
loss to Villanova. A

The outcome after the switch to
cherry was worse in terms of ﬁnal
margin, but better in terms of team
performance and lack of embarr-
assment. In the end, however,
Wayne still had a stain on his
tongue and Pitt had another
blemish on its record.

Pitt coach Tim Grgurich, how-
ever, was far from displeased with
the performance—-especially when
perusing the statistics of big
freshmen Ed Scheuermann and
Mike Rice after the game. ‘ ‘They’re
going to be players,” he said.

But they’re not quite there yet,

Moss photo

though for 13 minutes it looked as
though they were. Pitt took leads of
10-6 and 14-8 in the ﬁrst seven
minutes, then stayed even with the
Orange for six more. And then, in
the ﬁnal 7:35, the Panthers were
blown away.

The pace quickened, much to
Pitt’s disadvantage, and do did the
rate of Syracuse’s ascent to a
commanding position. 7

A ﬁve-minute, 10-point spurt by
frostbite-quick (considering the
conditions) guard Jim “Bug”
Williams keyed the Orange drive to
the lead. Williams, inserted with
Pitt holding a 20-18 edge, made four
layups and twofoul shots, the free

throws giving Syracuse a 42-24 lead S

with 1:19 left in the half.

That’s Syracuse 24, Pitt four in
six and one-half minutes. As any
television football analyst will tell
you, Syracuse has momentum.

“We didn’t want to get into a
running situation with them,”
Grgurich said. “But that’s the way
it turned out. They were running
and scoring and we were running
and missing layups.”

Such is a combination that can
shorten coaches’ life spans and
contracts. But Grgurich, now a
more realistic optimist, is taking the
defeats calmly, content to wait for
his team’s ‘apparent, though
probably not imminent, blooming.-

“One of these days, our lay-ins
will fall, and these kids will be the
ones blowing out some people.”

Those days may fast be

approaching, if the statistics of .

Orange Leave Aftertaste S

In a switch, Pitt Coach Tom Grgurich tried freshman Sonny Lewis at
point guard against Syracuse and the colorful freshman responded with

16 points, but the 3-12 Panthers fell again.

(Continued from Page 16)
Pitt’s freshman trio are any
indication. Rice scored 14 points
and contributed 16 rebounds in 29
minutes of playing time. The
official, Syracuse-supplied statis-
tics gave the 6-8 boardman from
Frederick, Md., only 14 rebounds,
but 16 is a more accurate count.

Syracuse went into the game
ranked seventh nationally in the
margin by which it outrebounded
opponents, and Orange statisticians
did nothing to hurt that standing.
They also robbed Scheuermann of
three rebounds_—he had 20, they

i gave him seven.

Larry Harris was Pitt’s top
point-getter, tossing in 20, but most
came while Syracuse fans were
readying for a cold drive home.
Scheuermann totaled 12 points.

Sonny «..Lewis emerged from a
recent slump with 16 points, despite
having a poor shooting night and
spending a portion of the evening at
point guard, an unfamiliar slot.
Lewis missed only three minutes of

Wilson photo
action, passed out a handful of
assists and asserted himself on the
court.

Lewis could be a ﬁxture at the top
of Pitt’s offensive key in the future,

especially if the Panthers land‘

Brashear High bruiser Sam Clancy,
as they expect to.

“Sonny played a lot of point
guard tonight,” Grgurich said.
“And he handled it very well.”
Well enough to spell trouble for
David Washington and Pete
Strickland, the current inhabitors of
that spot? Grgurish wouldn’t say.

What did spell trouble for the
entire Panther teamlwas the injury
Scott Nedrow, a 6-3 junior sniper
from Donora, sustained in practice
last week. A separated right
(shooting) shoulder leaves him out
of the Pitt picture indeﬁnitely. Him,
and his shooting eye.

The Panthers’ lack of shooters
was again evident in Syracuse, as

v Pitt’s 41.3 game percentage

indicated. Syracuse took 12 less
‘shots, but made six more ﬁeld goals

than the Panthers.

Shackleford, whose three-min-
ute, 10-point burst in the second
half put the Orange out to its

biggest lead, ﬁnished with 18 points

after an 8-for-10 shooting perfor-
mance to lead Syracuse. Williams
added 16 points and Kelley, whose
eight points in less than two
minutes near the start of the second
half made the Panthers forget
Grgurich’s halftime talk, ﬁnished
with 14.

It also was Kelley who started
what grew to be a nasty battle on the

court. Kelley decked Strickland '

(ﬁve assists in 19 minutes) as Pete
left the court at one point, so Wayne
Wi1liams—no candy-arm—let Kel-
ley and several other Orange-
men know he was there. And not
verbally. ‘ ‘Yeah, it got pretty rough
under there,” Wayne said. “Some
people got some pretty good shots
in,” he added, not referring to the
basket.

‘ ‘Our guys are learning the tough
way,” Grgurich said. “Against
tough teams. But things are
coming‘. Our kids are young and
we’re taking our beatings now.”

Wayne Williams doesn’t know.

what ﬂavor sucker he’ll take to
South Bend for Wednesday night’s
game with the Irish. _ “It just
depends on what I happen to pick
up,” he said.

Whatever ﬂavor it is, Grgurich
and his team are hoping it’s more
than a thirteen-rminute sucker.
They’d like to end up with the
last licks, for once.

PITT NOTES: The game drew
8,275 glad-to-be-inside Syracuse
fans, including more than 4,000 SU
students...'I'he Syracuse student
new/spaper’s pre-game story pre-
dicted, “Even the presence of poor
officiating or Tony Dorsett
shouldn’t be able to help Pitt
Saturday night.” Seems SU
partisans are still _sore about that
fourth-down placement in the
Pitt-Syracuse football game that
blunted a late Orange drive.

Temple Stands Tall
As Panthers Rebuild

BY STEVE SYBERT

It took a long time to build the
Temple gymnastics program and
the Pitt Panther squads failed in two
tries to tear it down as both the
men’s and women’s teams fell to
the ta1ented_Owls Saturday.

Men’s coach Frank D’Amico was
pleased with his squad’s perfor-
mance despite falling, 206.95-
177.60, to the second-ranked team
in the East, while Pantherette
mentor Donna DeMarino believed
her squad could have won, but had
to settle for a 128.85-126.75 defeat.

“We knew we could not beat this
team,” D’Amico said realistically,
“but we tried our hardest. We
went into the meet with a lot of new
routines. Just this week, we played
with some new and different tricks
and we put them in to see how well
we would do.

“Considering our injuries and
considering we had to change the
lineup a half-hour before the
meet,” D’Amico continued, “we
still managed to score 180 points
for the meet, which is very, very
good. Overall, I’m satisﬁed with
the results.”

It was even more of an uphill
struggle for the 2-1 Panthers, who
were hampered by injuries in the
vault and parallel bar events,
provoking D’Amcio to label them
“Our weakest events for sure.”
Freshman John Anderson replaced
injured Tony Savelli in the vault an
8.35 under extreme pressure.

“I watched him do a routine and
he looked pretty good,” D’Amico
said of his decision. “So at the
spur of the moment we put him in.
I was very plased with him—he’s
like a rock.”

Pressed ‘into action on the
parallel bars only two days before
the competition, Cem Akisoglu
turned in a respectable 6.40 in front
of a crew of tough nationally and
internationally ranked judges in
Philadelphia.

And then there was Doug Smith,
out all week with a muscle pull in
his neck, but still making the trip,
who shook off the injury to turn in
his best high bar performance of
the year——8.2. “He came through
for us again,” D’Amico lauded..".-

Pitt also received ﬁne perfor-
mances from its seniors—Rob
Pasterick, Don Stevenson and Mike
Petrosky, especially—who number
only ﬁve on the 17-man squad.
Pasterick, the team captain and the
Panthers’ number-one performer,
ﬁnished third in the all-around
versus Temple. Stevenson dis-
played a new and difﬁcult routine
on the floor and scored an 8.30 for
fourth, while Petrosky turned in an
8.0 for a third on the pommel
horse.

The Panthers, who consist of ﬁve
freshmen and ﬁve sophomores,
saw what the future has in store
with the performances of Anderson
and Keith Wipprecht (competing
for the ﬁrst time as an all-around
and turning in Pitt’s top score of
8.30 on the high bar).

“Our freshmen and sophomores
are doing good jobs for us,”
D’Amico enthused. “They’re
young and they have good heads on
their shoulders. I give them a lot of
credit.”

Another surprise came from
pommel horse specialist Mitch.
Spero, who gave the best perfor-
mance of his career, scoring a
7.50—an improvement of two full
points over his score against Navy
only a week ago. Tom Bires also

came through with a ﬁne showing in '

the floor exercise. .

The men gymnasts have two
meetsremaining, both on the road,
against Slippery Rock this Saturday
and Penn State next Saturday.
D’Amico is conﬁdent of whipping
the Rockets, but the always-tough
Nittany Lions leave him a little
pessimistic.

Tracksters Relay Victory to Buckeyes

BY DAVE McD ONALD

COLUMBUS—In a wrestling
match, it’s the heavyweight bout. In
football, it’s the two-minute warn-
ing. In golf, it comes down to the

' 18th hole. And in baseball, it’s the

bottom of the ninth. But in track,
when every event is neck-and-neck,
the meet comes to a crescendo in the
mile relay.
. Andre Previn couldn't have
conducted a more exciting meet as
the Panthers met the Ohio State
Buckeyes and Cornell Saturday in a
triangular meet at Columbus.

Going into the mile relay, the

scores read: Ohio State 53, Cornell
51 and Pitt 49.

Up to then it was a hard-fought 49
points for the Panthers, who started
off their battle with Tom Herrmann

leading the way in the mile run.
Herrmann ran a blazing 4:08.4 to
take first on a slow-to-average

, track. The time lowered Herr-
mann’s best mile mark by ﬁve
seconds, coming down from the
4:13 he ran last ' week in the
triangular meet at Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse against Slippery Roc

_ and West Virginia. -

Also picking up a point in the mile

was Nort McDonald, with a 4: 16.3

‘ for fourth. (In a triangular meet the

scoring is ﬁve points for ﬁrst, three

, for second, two for third and one for
fourth).

The Panthers picked up three

more points in the 440-yard run as
Keith Leckenby placed third with a
51.5 and Larry Shippen clipped
. fourth in 51.9. ,
Freshman Dan Dattilo ran his
personal best in the half-mile,
placing second with a well-fought
1:56.1. Rich Moore was close
behind, ﬁnishing fourth in 1:56.2.
Dan Schuerle and Kevin Carpen-

 

Graduate Program

ter provided a good one-two punch
in ,_ the 70-yard high hurdles,
winning eight points for Pitt.

Schuerle was clocked in 8.6 for ﬁrst
place and Carpenter 8.7 for second.

Meanwhile, Herrmann almost
pulled off a double victory by nearly
taking the 1000-yard run, but he had
to settle for second with a 2:1S.6.
Tom Fitzgerald secured fourth
place, running his best time with a
2216.4.

The Panther distance corps ran
down eight big points in the
two-mile run. Mel Boyd took the
lead from the starting line and
refused to give it up as he won in a
ﬁne 8:55.5. Terry Wile nabbed
third in 9211.7 and McDonald came
back with a 9:12.1 for fourth.

The ﬁeld events supplied 16
important points, with Eric Dres-
cher and Keith Taylor claiming ﬁve
apiece. Drescher won the shot with
a put of 52’11’ ’ (a foot improvement
over last week). Taylor placed
second in the triple jump, setting
his personal best with a 48’11”-—‘
then teamed with Dan Goodyear in
the high jump. Each jumped 6’6”,
but Goodyear was awarded second
on fewer misses. Taylor settled for
third.

Don Maydak rounded out the
pre-mile relay 49 points by
long-jumping his all-time best with
a leap of 22’5”—-good enough for

 second place.

After the completion of the last
ﬁeld event, it was center-stage for
the mile relay. The end of the line
was at hand. The capacity-ﬁlled
ﬁeldhouse could feel the excitement
building, as could the three teams
lined around the track. It was all up
to those mile relay squads——one of
them would "win the meet for their
university. . V . '-

Panthers. He handed off the baton

in a close second with a split of 51.8.

Larry Shippen was up next——
handing off in second place, but
quickening the pace to 51.0.

Kevin Carpenter tried his best to
put the race away with his 50.0. He
finally did get the lead for
anchorman Willie Walker, who
cruised the ﬁrst 220 yards in a quick
22.5, gaining a good 20 yards on
fading Ohio State and Cornell. But
Walker began to tire out, or, to put it
in his own words, “after 330 yards I
felt like a locomotive hitting a wall.’ ’
After Walker climbed.over the wall
it was too late—the Buckeye
anchorman had passed and taken

ﬁrst place in the relay and the meet.

The ﬁnal score: Ohio State 58,
Pitt 52 and Cornell 51. '

Track coach Mike Agostinella
was very pleased with his team’s
results Saturday, even though it
didn’t come out on top.

‘‘I was very happy with the
team’s overall performance, not
only on ‘the track but around the
track,” Agostinella said. “The
cohesiveness of the team really
helped down the stretch with
everybody cheering each other on. ’ ’

As with any sport, the home team
in track has an advantage, and at
Ohio State there was no exception.

“Keith Taylor performed well in

the triple jump with adverse
conditions from the Ohio State
throng and biased Buckeye‘ ofﬁ-
cials,” Agostinella stated.‘ “I was

also elated with how well Herrmann -,

and Boyd ran, along with Maydak
and Mark Studnicki (4:16.5 mile)
reaching their personal bests.”
Everybody at the French Field
House agreed that the track meet
they had" witnessed and in which

 ‘

they had performed was the most ‘

exciting they had experienced.

Track fans can see the Panthers in
action this weekend when they host
the Pitt Invitational Friday evenin

House.

  Forsooﬂr! Matmen Fall

BY JIM LEWIS

“Double, double, toil and
trouble...”

Lehigh burned and Millersville
State bubbled, as the Pitt wrestling
team was Shakespeared twice over
the weekend——22-20 to State and
41-3 to the Engineers—to lose its
unbeaten braggings and 18th
national ranking.

Little did the Panthers suspect _

they would face double toil and
double trouble, beginning with
Millersville on Friday. ‘

Jackie Kline started things off
innocently enough, for Pitt, defeat-
ing State’s Ken Kirshner, 6-4.

I But then ‘the Brutuses began
ganging up on the Panther Caesars,
stabbing consistently until Pitt’s Ed
Bredniak (150) saved face with a 5-4
decision over Jim Seedor and Skip
Bolin (167) won a disqualiﬁcation

decision due to illegal stalling
tactics over Millersville’s Greg
Weldon.

Later, Bill Bailey (190) crushed
Charlie White, 18-6, to put Pitt
within striking distance, 22-17, but
a noble try for a six-point pin by
comeback artist Mark Stepanovich
fell short—-he could only manage a
6-2 decision against Carl Fredrick
instead—and thus the Panthers
(5-2) suffered their ﬁrst defeat since
the Ides of March, a 22-20 loss.

“We did not perform well,” Pitt
Coach Dave Adams claimed. “The
weights from 167 pounds and down
did poor1y——we depended on our
heavyweights to pull us through,
but we were too deep in the hole.”

Would the outcome have been
any different if Pitt fought for a
possible tie with State instead of
trying for the difﬁcult pin?

“We go for everything,” Adams

said quickly. “We were going for
the win.”

A victory against undefeated
Millersville (7-0) would have looked

impressive added to the Panthers’ t I

credentials—andiState felt a
decision against Pitt just as

"important, making much ado about

the hard-fought conquest.

“After they beat us,’f recalled
Adams, “they believed they could
go through the rest of the season
unbeaten. They felt we were
standing in their way.”

And the Panthers would have
poisoned Millersville’s Romeo-and-

‘Juliet hopes of a star—crossedW
perfect season if one or two things '

had gone the other way.

‘ ‘If we could have won at leastone
more match and prevented a fall
(two Panther matmen were pinned),
we would have won the mate ,”

conﬁdent of taking this team which
has beaten us in the past, because
our scores this year greatly surpass
theirs.”

Also facing Slippery Rock Satur-
day, the Pantherette gymnasts
faired a lot better against their foes
from Temple. Regina Carson
turned in another fine performance,
ﬁnishing third in the all-around with
a score of 32.85 and tying for second
in both the ﬂoor and beam events.

Other notable performances ‘were
given by Allison Hoburg—third on

C uneven bars and ﬂoor exercise-—

and Cyndee Severlyn, third on the
balance beam. Overall, the
Pantherettes defeated Temple both
on the beam and in the floor
exercise. ’DeMarino said her team
was hurt the most on vaulting,
where the Owls tallied four more
points in the ﬁnal total.

But they didn’t, and as -a result,
Pitt suffered against Lehigh.
Saturday the same fate as
Macbeth——being haunted by the
ghost of a loss.

“The guys felt down about the
loss-felt sorry for themselves,”
Adams stated. “It’s not an ideal

situation. The younger guys didn’t —

adjust too well, but that's part of the
maturing process and will pay off
later in the year.”

It may pay off, but the fee is
costly. And the roaring crowd in the

tiny Engineers’ gym didn’t help the A

situation. _

‘ ‘The crowd was intimidating the
whole team,” Adams agreed.
“They stomped their feet and
screamed and hollered. It didn’t
bother just the inexperienced
younger, guys——it bothered every-
one.”

It was certainly a comedy of
errors at highly-regarded Lehigh;

\.
this time, the heavyweights were
ineffective and the lighterweights
prevailed.

All of the Engineers wrestled like
champs, and so the Panthers were
humiliated, 41-3.

‘ Despite the two disappointing
downfalls, Adams is looking
forward to a brighter future.

“We hope the students give us a
chance,” Adams said. “Our kids
are pretty aggressive. 'I'hey’re

H making mistakes now because they ’

are aggressive. But they’ll mature,
and it would do us good if the
student body really got behind us.
We're hoping to bounce back.”
