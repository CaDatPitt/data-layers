Pitt’s engineering department, in conjunc-
tion with a European power management
company, unveiled a state—of—the-art lab on
Thursday that will aid in University research
and education. _
Gerald Holder, dean of the Swanson School
of Engineering, ﬂipped the ceremonial ﬁrst
switch on a new electric power systems lab
at 11 a.m. Thursday morning. Eaton, a power
management company headquartered inIre—
land, donated the lab, which is located on the
eighth ﬂoor of Benedum Hall, now known as
the buildings Energy Floor. . .
“This lab has set the bar higher for electri-
cal engineering across the country,” Holder,
who has served on panels for the National
Science Foundation and the Department of
Energy, said in a statement. “It will enable our
students andfaculty to better explore the next
generation of sustainable power engineering
techniques.” ; —. is

a second time as a column byjulia Carpey, a columnist for the newspaper. This second instance was printed erroneously. The editorial attributed to Carpey does not neces-
sarily reﬂect her views and instead reﬂects the views of The Pitt News Editorial Board. The Pitt News regrets this error. s '

augural address.

In his introduction, Gish commented
on the new Board members’ “clean”
campaigns, referring to the zero infrac-
tions ﬁled by ‘candidates during the
2013 election season.

Gish said the clean campaigns were a
“reflection on the integrity of the candi-
datessand values that have been instilled
and encouraged in them by [Pitt].”

Nordenberg thanked the outgoing
Board, and quoted a passage from last
year’s accreditation report from the

search and the sense of pride among
the University community.

“There seems to be an‘ ethos’ of ap-
preciation that evokes humility in those
of us who come to observe it,” N orden-
berg quoted from the report.

Nordenberg said SGB works to evoke
this humility and cultureand wished
the 2014 Board well.

Nordenberg said he was conﬁdent
that the Board will work to “advance
an agenda that, in the words of the Pitt
Promise, will;work to leave this Univer-
sity a better place for those who follow.”

“I hope that 2014 will be an equally
rewarding and productive year for
[SGB],” he added.

As he bid farewell to Pitt’s student

government, Louderback offered the A

torate in electrical engineering, said he hopes
the lab will help the University take the next
step forward in power delivery technology.
“Iwantthis lab to turn into aplace of trans-
formation, breakthrough, creation and origi-
nality,” Grainger, who is also a Richard King
Mellon research fellow, said. “It will create
insight, intuition and partnership, which are
all important for a well—rounded education.”
The Richard King Mellon Research Fellow-
ship, which the Richard King Mellon Foun-
dation operates, commits its funds almost
exclusively to organizations in southwestern
Pennsylvania, and its programs focus on re-
gional economic development, according to
its website.
After Holder introduced the lab to the
public for the ﬁrst time, graduate students
Patrick Lewis, Emmanuel Taylor and Ansel

Barchowsky gave a brief demonstration.

Lewis referenced last year’s Super Bowl,
during which a lighting malfunction tempo-
rarily stopped the game. He said the electric
power systems lab uses energy in a way that
would have prevented thelights from short-
circuiting because of the magnitude of the
electrical power usage at the game.

Daniel Camovale, manager of Eaton’s Pow-
er Systems Experience Center, and Gregory
Reed, director of the Energy Power Initia-
tive, which oversees energy programs at the
Swanson School, helped lead the process of
designing custom Workbenches intended for
a variety of uses within the laboratory.

The lab contains six of these Workbenches,
along with a large high-deﬁnition screen,
sound system and other features.

The lab also integrates the solar panels,
installed in 2012, located on the roof of Ben-
edum Hall to partially power in the lab.

According to a press release from Eaton,
the lab’s main uses for research and instruc-

tion include smart grid technologies, power
electronics devices, renewable energy sys-
tems, energy storage and power quality.
According to Eaton’s press release, the
University’s engineering department has
worked on creating new course developments
in these areas to fully integrate the lab in un-
dergraduate studies. The laboratory will serve
primarily for undergraduates majoring in
electrical engineering with an electric powe
concentration. ’
Last year, the Swanson School made fur-
ther strides in electrical engineering edu-
cation, according to Eaton’s press release.
The department launched a distance—based
graduate certiﬁcate program in electrical
engineering, providing a unique choice for

» post-graduates in the workforce to still receive

graduate classroom lectures.

Revathi Advaithi, president of the Electri-
cal Sector of Eaton’s Americas Region, said
this is just the latest of Eaton’s collaboration
with Pitt to make the University a top engi-

neering program.

‘ “Part of our goal is to help develop Pitts-
burgh as an energy hub for the future,” Ad-
vaithi said. '

Eaton and Pitt have collaborated over the
past ﬁve years through Eaton’s participation
in the Swanson School’s co—op program. This

. year, the program named Eaton the Co-op

Employer of the Year forits commitment to
quality projects for students involved in co-
ops with the organization. .

“Eaton’s mission is to create an environ-
ment of efficient, safe and reliable energy for
the future, and this lab is a good step towards
doing that,” Advaithi said at the event.

Holder said the new lab will help prepare
students and faculty for the future.

“Two of our academic and research priori-
ties are energy and sustainability,” he said, 4’
“and the new electric power systems lab will
enable our students and faculty to better ex-
plore the next generation of sustainable power
engineering technologies.” I

“Ifthere is one thing that I wish some-
one would have told me two years ago, it
would be to utilize the people and tools

Louderback recommended the new,

Board pay particular attention to Pitt’s
student body.

“You’d be surprised about the ideas
they have,” he said.

Louderback recounted some of the
successes of the 2013 Board, includ-
ing the overhaul of SGB’s bylaws, the
installation ofbike service stations on
campus, assistance in the adoption of
the Worker Rights Consortium by Pitt
and the extension ofHillman Library’s

he said. ’

Gish closed the ceremony and con-
gratulated SGB for its success over the

Affordable Care

Act de—stigmatizes

mental illness, helps millions

Julia Carpey
Columnist

Bryce Friedmann has health insur-
ance, but that doesn’t mean she can
see the therapist of her choice or
even the one who might help her
the most with her condition.

This has been a harsh reality
for many patients who deal with
mental illness in America. But with
the implementation of the Afford-
able Care Act, previous restrictions
on mental health coverage (such as
choosing a therapist) will be lifted,
expanding options and making
treatment more accessible.

According to Healthcare.gov,
the website set up by the U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human
Services under the Affordable Care
Act, the law will increase access
to mental health and substance-
abuse-disorder services in three

primary ways.

First, the law creates the largest’

expansion of mental health cover-

age in a generation by covering 62
million more'Americans.than are
now covered.

Second, the new law forces
insurers to cover the costs of
preventative and early detection
screenings, assessments of fam-
ily histories and consideration of
genetic predispositions and envi-
ronmental factors.

Additionally, insurers are no
longer allowed to deny coverage
for pre-existing health conditions,
which include depression, schizo-
phrenia, anxiety disorders or other
mental illnesses. A

Many are hoping this will also
help erase the stigma surrounding
mental illnesses.

Julie Donohue, associate profes-
sor in Pitt’s Department of Health
Policy and Management, said that
there are apparent differences in
private insurance coverage between
mental illnesses and other illnesses.

“Unequal insurance beneﬁts for
treatment for mental illnesses may

have reinforced beliefs that mental
illnesses are less serious and debili-
tatingthan other health problems,”
Donohue said.

While private insurers may
have never intended to maintain
the stigma, they may have inadver-
tently done so by perpetuating the
above notion.

Clare Krusing of America’s
Health Insurance Plans, a trade
association that represents com-
panies that sell private health
insurance, declined to comment
when asked about the differences
between mental health coverage
and other types of coverage.

The World Psychiatric Associa-
tion, an international organization
comprised of 135 international psy-
chiatric societies, released a study
in 2006 that outlines legislation in
developing countries, such as Ma-
laysia, Sri Lanka and Nigeria, that
has allowed mental illness to be

treated as a legitimate disease, rather than a
foreign concept to be feared and stigmatized.
Friedmann’s insurance only allows her to
see therapists with Ph.D.s. She said the thera-
pist she prefers has only a master’s degree.
This leaves her in a difficult position.
Friedmann, a senior applied developmen-
tal psychology major, said these lirriitations
have left her to consult with a therapist in
Pitt’s Counseling Center. But because of the
Counseling Center’s tight schedule, Fried-

mann said she does not get as much time in
appointments as she would like.
According to Tevya Zukor, director of
Pitt’s Counseling Center, students undergo
a brief screeningwith the ﬁrst available coun-
selor upon scheduling an initial appointment.
After assessingwhat the student’s needs are,
he or she is assigned toa counselor who spe-
cializes in those particular needs.
While Pitt does not plan on changing the
policies and practices in its Counseling Center

 in response to the Affordable Care Act, Zukor
said he thinks the legislation will give young

adults access to more optionsof appropriate

University’s services.

“[The Affordable Care Act] will help‘de-
stigmatize mental illness in its accessibility
to younger people,”. Zukor said.

President Barack Obama’s push for univer-
sal health care may result in an improvement
for Friedmann by expanding access to mental
health coverage. By removing limitations and
making detection and treatment available
on a broader scale, the Affordable Care Act
will open up the conversation about mental
health and treatment options.

Other provisions of the Affordable Care
Act allow for the coverage of children on their

parents’ plans until they are 26. This is a relief .

for Friedmann, who said she would otherwise
be scrambling to make ends meet to afford
any insurance that would cover her mental
health care expenses. - .

Friedmarm said she believes that if the
Affordable Care Act had been in effect when
she was younger, her illness could have been
diagnosed earlier. ‘

“I wish that it was in place when I was
younger,” Friedmann said. “It would have
been great had somebody seen my personal
statistics of predisposition to mental illness
and made it a point to check in every now
and then.” I '

Panthers put hot streak on line against Wake Forest

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

For Pitt Coachjamie Dixon, predictable
isn’t a term he’d use to describe Wake
Forest’s record. Just lookat their recent
schedule.

“We obviously know what -they did

against North Carolina, and we know
what they did against Virginia.”

The games Dixon mentioned resulted
in a win for Wake_Forest (11-4, 1-1 ACC)
against conference heavyweight North

» Carolina and a loss on the road to mid-

dling Virginia. For the Panthers to avoid
a fate similar to that suffered by the Tar
Heels against the Demon Deacons, Dixon
stressed the need for a good start to Sat-
urday’s game.

“We’ve gotta come out there and do
the things we need to do and not let them
get going early,” Dixon said.

Because of Wake Forest’s loss to Vir-
ginia, Dixon has_conveyed the message of
a good start to his players. And it appears
as though the player have taken note.

5‘,They’re just coming off a tough loss,
so they’re going to come out strong,”
freshman forward Jamel Artis said.
“We’ve just got to come and play like
we do every game.”

Pitt (14-1, 2-0 ACC) looks to improve
on its perfect conference record, albeit
only two games into ACC play. The Pan-
thers are led by redshirt senior forward
Lamar Patterson’s team—best 17.3 points
and 4.4 assists per game. ‘ ‘

Redshirt senior center Talib Zanna

anchors Pitt in the frontcourt with his 1
12.1 points and :team—high 7.7 rebounds-

per game. Zanna nearly recorded his
ﬁfth double-double of the season against
Maryland when he scored 15 points and
pulled down nine ‘rebounds.

Wake Forest is led in the scoring
department by sophomore guard Codi
Miller—McIntyre’s 15.9 points per game,
and the Demon Deacons feature three
others players averaging double—digit
points.

Sophomore Devin Thomas poses a
test for Pitt in the paint with his 6-foot-
9—inch, 245—pound frame. Thomas is
head coachJeffBzdelik’s second—leading

scorer at 10.7 points per game. The for— V‘
ward leads the Demon Deacons with 8.9‘

rebounds per game. a

“Big physical guy, runs the floor,”
Dixon said. “He’s a guy that candrive
it, he’s an inside—out guy, good passer.”

at 2 p.m. to face a Tigers team that has
had similar struggles in conference play
in recent years.

The Tigers have compiled only 10
conference wins since the beginning of
the 2010-2011 season, with losses this
season in both of two conference games
—— one against No. 2 Notre Dame and,
most recently, a lopsided‘89-6'8 defeat
at the hands of Georgia Tech.

Despite the Tigers’ struggles, Pitt
head coach Suzie McConnell-Serio said

Clemson is a dynamic team.
“Watching them on film, they are
extremely athletic and quick,” McCon-
nell-Serio said. “We want to be able to
defend and slow them down and make
them execute in the half court. They
are very balanced. They don’t have one
player that is scoring a ton of points.
You have to respect everyone.”
Clemson has ﬁve scorers who aver-

age more than eight points per game,
led by junior guard Nikki Dixon (11.3
points per game). Dixon is coming off
a career-high 26 point performance
against Georgia Tech in the Tigers’ last
game.

Junior guard Brianna Kiesel ex-
plained that building a win streak could
provide a huge boost to the team.

“I really do think getting on a_ win
streak and having that conﬁdence on
a high is going to help us,” Kiesel said.
“When we play confident, we look con-
fident and we play well. Coach [McCo-
nnell—Serio] really helps us with that
and always comes in and gives us the
conﬁdence to go out and play well.”

But the ACC schedule allows no time
for basking in limited spurts of success,
since Pitt hosts No. 2 Notre Dame and
Syracuse (receiving votes in national
polls), then travels to No. 3 Duke in its
next three games.

Certainly beating any one of those
highly-touted opponents could mark a
signature win in year one ofthe McCon-
nell—Serio era. If the coach can keep re-
ceiving star performances from her best

players, namely Kiesel, the Panthers"

reputation might rise around the league.

But the Panthers aren’t at that point
just yet, according to their head coach.

“We have seen so many signs of prog-
ress with our team, and the more suc-
cess you have, the more confident you
are,” McConnell—Serio said. “It would be
a huge win for us, especially another big
one on the road. They are hungry and
are looking for a first conference win.

Jahuaiy i0, 20’! 4 l The Pitt News l v\ANw.piitnevvs.corn

We have a lot of respect to still earn in
this league.”

Kiesel shined in Pitt’s win over Vir-
ginia, posting a game-high 26 points and
seven assists. That performance came

’ on the heels ofa 20-point, seven-assist

effort in the Panthers’ ACC home opener
versus Florida State.

Her two standout performances were
recognized in the ACC and on a national
scale.

Kiesel was awarded ACC Player of the
Week honors and was named the Na-
tional Player of the Week by the United
States Basketball Writers Association.

“These individual accolades are nice,
but I wouldn’t be able to do it without
the team,” Kiesel said. “We had two re-
ally good showings against Florida State
and Virginia. I think we all played really
hard and with a lot of confidence, and
it was really big for us to get that first
conference win.”

Kiesel is the first player in program
history to receive the national honor
from the basketball writers association.

A repeat effort from Pitt’s starting
five may be needed Sunday against a
Tigers squad that has held opponents
to a collective 38.6 field goal percent-
age. Kiesel, combined with senior for-
ward Asia Logan, redshirt senior guard
Ashlee Anderson, redshirt sophomore
Loliya Briggs and senior guard Mar-
quel Davis, scored 74 of Pitt’s 79 points
against Virginia.

“We are going to focus on the good
things that we do,” Kiesel said on the
gameplan for Sunday. “Really work on
us and focus on getting into our offense.
Just come in with that mindset that we
worked really hard, and let all that work
pay off in the games.” H

Talib‘Zauna‘lea¢.5s Pitt with 7.7 rebounds per game. Sheldon Satensteinl Assistant Visual Editor

1

Because of the matchup problems
Thomas poses with his capabilities in
the frontcourt andthe perimeter, fresh-

man forwards Michael Young and Artis ’

will face another defensive challenge
after squaring off against the perimeter-
oriented Evan Smotrycz of Maryland.

“They’re very aggressive,” Young said.
“Their three and their four go for offen-
sive rebounds.” -

In addition to Miller—McIntyre and
Thomas, senior guard Coron Williams
and senior forward Travis McKie score
more than 10 points per game. Williams,
a graduate student, is spending his ﬁnal
year of eligibility at Wake Forest after
playing four years at Robert Morris.

Also in the starting lineup, Tyler
Cavanaugh is a type of forward that is
similar to Smotrycz and Albany’s Sam
Rowley. The sophomore fromjamesville,
N.Y.,‘ scores just less than nine points
per game and has started all 15 of Wake
Forest’s games this season.

“He’s kind ofa stretch four that will
drive it,” Dixon said. “That’s something
that we’ve seen.”

Players such as Cavanaugh are becom—
ing more common in college basketball,
and the Panthers had the chance to play
against a number of them — such as
Rowley — in nonconference play.

“I think that’s something we’ve seen
more of,” Dixon said. “We’ve seen more
stretch fours in the nonconference, so
you see more opportunities of that.” A

While the Panthers will adjust to what
the Demon Deacons bring to the table,
their attitude remains the same.

“Same game plan: Go out there and
win the rebounding margin by 10-plus,
be physical, always bephysical, always
tough,” Young said. “Different team,
same attitude.” I
