Fireman responds to yet another

The University— of Pittsburgh’s
Graduate School of Public Health
and School of Nursing in coopera-
tion with Shadyside and West Penn
Hospitals is beginning a three-year
research program for the education
of women who are at increased risk
for the development of ‘breast
cancer. During the course of this’
scientiﬁc study, 3,000 women who
have a family history of breast
‘cancer will be provided with an edu-
cational program to improve breast
cancer self-examination and other
early detection practices. If success-
ful, this program could then serve as
a_ model for other programs in
Pennsylvania. ‘

According to one of the principal
investigators, Joyce Yasko of the
School of Nursing, “This research is

Meetings

For the past few weeks, Dr. Ber-
nard Kobosky, the vice chancellor
for public affairs, has been attending

a series of meetings dealing specifi-
cally with the Fifth Avenue bus lane

problem.‘
This problem didn’t start just a

- few weeks ago. The controversy has

existed as long as the bus lane,

affects one out of every 1 1 women in

the United States, and the potential I

for cure or long-term control of the

_ disease increases when the disease is
detected at an early stage of develop-
ment. Since the cause of breast
cancer is unknown at the present
time, early detection methods such
as breast self-examination and
mammography remain the mainstay
for action.” .

Several recently completed stud-
ies have demonstrated that early
detection of breast cancer can
reduce the mortality rate by 30 to 40
percent. Under-utilization of availa-

ble screening and early detection

may be one of the major reasons for
failure to reduce breast cancer mor-
tality signiﬁcantly. Every woman at
risk of breast cancer should be
taught breast self-exarnination and

according to Kobosky. In the most
recent meeting, the following spe-
ciﬁc actions were agreed upon:

0 A l5-mph speed limit will be
enforced by Oakland law enforce-
ment agencies, and bus drivers will
be cited for exceeding the speed
limit. The 61A and B buses will be
rerouted to Forbes to relieve some of
the congestion. ’

0 A campaign will be launched to
promote different warning signs.
Also, the lanes and the adjacent side-
walks will be painted with diagonal

participating in the project will be

encouraged to again engage in the

“Hopefully, through [the pro-

program that not only educates
women about breast cancer but also
increases the likelihood of com-

That couldn't be done. It would be

careful  at the same time, the bus
authorities must also be careful.”
Jay Roiling, assistant to the vice
chancellor, said, “If we rerouted all
of the buses onto. Forbes, then the
fire trucks and ambulances that use
Forbes as an access wouldn’t be able
to get through. There are 700 east-

Career
Advice

 

 

 

 

By Mike Nicol
For The Pitt News

It’s inevitable. Whether you are a

senior or a freshman, an engineering *-

or a music major, a diligent scholar
or a chronic procrastinator —
you've probably experienced anx-
iety about your future in tomorrow's
job world. Is there ajob out there for
you? Will you be qualified for it
when you graduate? Do you even
know what sort of career you want

to pursue? The Career Counseling _A

Center and their upcoming Career
Seminar may have the answers for
you.

L Aside from giving day-to-day
career counseling and guidance, the
staff has organized an upcoming
seminar, which will be held on
October 1-4. This is the 16th year of
the seminars, which are designed to
give students the opportunity to
interact with professionals in the
field that interests the students. The
objective, according to career coun-
selor and head of the information
center, Caroline Grundy, is to “help
students learn about their needs job-
wise, and their work values...in gen-
eral, the world of work that they live

59

u-.

The seminar will operate in a
booth arrangement, with represen-

tatives encouraging one-on-one’

talks with concerned students. There
will be one speech given by Bob Per-
koski, who works here at Pitt, on

“How to Survive a Job Interview."

Schedule of the four-day event can
be obtained at the counseling center.
A wide range of occupational fields
will have representatives in every-
thing from accounting to television
reporting, to world affairs and most
everything between. One of the Pitt
graduates scheduled,to speak here is
Dr." Scott Derco, an optometrist
who is “very eager to answer career
questions and help the students in
any way possible." i

The people behind the four-day
event are the individual counselors
who comprise the Counseling Cen-
ter, which is located on the 3rd floor
at the William Pitt Union. The cen-
ter has many counselors and offices
along with an information center
headed by Caroline Grundy.

Among the many informative
items in the center are book and ﬁle
material on various college oriented
careers, books on career planning

and files on the Pittsburgh area job j

outlook. The counselors are availa-
ble for appointments with the stu-
dents whether the problem should
be career-oriented or not. Says
Grundy, “We try to be unbiased
because we’re aware that the student

has everyone telling him a different .

thing to do” in the situations.

Buckley Amendment

Section 438 of the General Education Provisions Act, as

amended by Section 513 of Public Law 93-568, referred to as
the “Privacy Rights of Parents and Students”(more commonly
called the “Buckley Amendment”), requires that the U niversity
of Pittsburgh give notice to parents and students of the follow-
ing information.

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy

of students. In order to do so, these provisions are binding on
the university:

— Individual student records include only information

necessary and relevant to the educational purposes of the
institution.

—- Student records are open for inspection by students or

parents of students under 18 years of age upon request, with the
exception that letters of recommendation written prior to Jan.
1, 1980, remain confidential. Additionally, specific documents
that students have waived their right to inspect remain
confidential.

— Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records.
— The institution may not release student records outside

the institution without student consent, unless one of several
exceptions applies. l

— Requests external to the institution for information

regarding students should be documented, as should releases of
student information.

—— The university may establish categories of information

known as “Directory Information?’ and release this informa-
tion upon request by individuals external to the institution.
This may be done only after students are provided the oppor-
tunity to request exclusions from the directory. ' ,

Greater specificity and further information regarding excep-

tions may be obtained in 738 William Pitt Union.

information be removed from the University of ‘Pittsburgh’s

(UPI) — Police in Longmeadow,
Mass., said several teenage boys
have repaid nearly $200 they
charged to an Illinois man’s credit

' card. The police said the boys

/

‘r

pirated the credit card number from
a computer ﬁle and used it to order
computer equipment from a New
Hampshire company.

Police sergeant Robert Danio
said the “computer whiz kids” fig-
ured out how to pirate credit card
numbers and copyrighted video
game programs.

Because the purchases were for
less than $200, the boys’ parents
cooperated and paid the company,
which did not prosecute.

(UPI) -— A study conducted in
Florida suggests that about one out
of four American eighth-graders
expects to smoke marijuana this
year; nearly one out of ﬁve says he’ll
use cocaine or heroin; and more
than half plan to drink alcoholic
beverages.

Mary Ann Moore, a spokesman
for the community group that con-
ducted the study, said its results
apply nationwide. In fact, Moore
stated, drug and alcohol usage may
be higher elsewhere. A

She said that one of the most dis-
turbing statistics is that more than
15 percent of the eighth-graders said
that they expect to inhale glue, gaso-
line or liquid paper to get “high” —
all activities that can cause brain
damage.

Florida Senator Paula Haykins
said that the survey of more than
1,500 students is the most complete
and comprehensive study of junior
high school "drug use ever.

The study also polled high school
seniors in the area and found that
more than one out of five acknowl-
edged having driven while intoxi-
cated and upwards of 40 percent said
that they had been a passenger in a
car driven by a person under the
inﬂuence of drugs or alcohol.

Why do they do it? The students

‘ told the pollsters that they use drugs
or drink because everybody else is
doing it,” there’s nothing else to do”
— and in any case, they don’t really

believe it’s so bad.

   

 
   
   

  

 
     

Government

 

 

(UPI) — Vice President George
Bush, a former director of the CIA,
rejected a suggestion by President
Reagan that the Carter administra-
tion may be responsible for last
week’s bombing in Lebanon.

In Saginaw, Mich., yesterday,
Bush was asked about Reagan’s sug-
gestion two days ago that the near
destruction of the U.S. intelligence
capability before he took office con-
tributed to a lack of warning about
the explosion.

Bush said that he thinks Reagan
was only trying to say that laying off
a large number of people and thus
curtailing the CIA’s sources on intel-
ligence was not good for the overall
intelligence community. But, he
added that, “On any specific inci-
dent, I couldn’t level that kind of
charge.”

Bush also had some mixed com-
ments about Walter Mondale. He
said Mondale has been “statesman-

like” in his comments about Rea-'

gan’s meeting today with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.
But, he also said Mondale has been
mean-spirited in his criticism of
Reagan’s policies on war and peace.

(UPI) — Scientists from the Car-

cache of 50-million-year-old fossils,
the rewards of a find this summer in
Wyoming. ,

Dr. Leonard Krishtalka said
between l0 and 15 percent of the 65
different species found previously
had not been known to man. He said
that this is the greatest collection of
fossils in the world from that time
period. _

Among the new species found by
the team were various forms of
squirrels, crocodiles and frogs.

Krishtalka said many of the fossils
will eventually be on display in the
Carnegie Museum, but there is still
more work to be done on the pieces.

(UPI) — Author James Michener

$2,000 scholarship he received from
Swarthmore College in 1925 by

Gut Course

Riding the trough of a perfect 0-3 season, the Pitt football
team has changed its colors. Their initial embarrassment has
turned their blue and gold to an off shade of pink and, more
recently, bright red. The team has also suffered the harsh
criticism of peers and fans. However, much of the ﬂak they’ve
received is not directed so much at the coaches (who, under the
able leadership of Foge Fazio, are quite good) or even the team
itself. I

The student body at Pitt is venting some of its collective
frustration with what the sport has become at Pitt. They are
also angered with the bloated egos, open violence and cavalier
attitudes of select players, responsible for much of the bad press
the team has received.

In verbally attacking the team, the average Pitt student is
showing his anger over alleged financial rewards for football
players and their reputation for what can only be described as a

total lack of concern for academics.

Schools such as Pitt make literally millions of dollars on the

 _ backs of their athletes, while at the same time, the pros use
, I ~..__colleg,es as their minor league. A really talented player is worth

.q'uit—e' a bit of money to the uniiversity,"biit4'thiis isno excuse for‘

  ;.~t.h*e university to place lower demands on him than it doeslfor

any other student. Nor is talent an excuse for a player’s open

’ I ’ arrogance and egoism. However, the deal that college adminis-
A ; gtrators and the pros have made benefits their pocketbooks
- lg-while it erodes the academic rigors of the university.

The Pitt football team should take all this ribbing they’ve
received lately as a healthy lesson in humility. We remain
skeptical but hope that this class isn’t cut.

Same Song

The United States’ political impotence in the Middle
East was revealed again in our failure to address the
problem of terrorism against U.S. installations.

After the devastating attack on the Marine barracks in
Beirut, President Reagan did little more than wring his
hands and hem and haw about what a tragedy it was, this
cowardly act. Well, the same group is supposedly respon-
sible for Thursday’s cowardly act —— an act that claimed
at least 23 lives. The president has done nothing, and it
appears he will maintain this policy.

The vast number of contenders for power in Lebanon
makes the problem quite difficult for the president. Rea-
gan’s general policy is to simplistically divide the world
into “them that’s for us and them that’s against us." When
there are as many rivals as there are in Lebanon, the point
of division becomes blurred, leaving Reagan with no
clear horse to back. Hence the president’s do-nothing
approach. .

This attitude aids those who play on anti-U.S. feelings
in the region. Terrrorist groups in the Middle East know
that Reagan has resigned the U.S. to submit to these
attacks without retaliation. The small bands of revolu-
tionaries can now not only beat up on the evil U.S.
imperialist forces and save the world for their brand of
Islam in a holy Jihad, but do so and live to tell about it.

We need not retaliate with a policy of death, but some
concise and consistent policy is needed. The U.S. needs to
restore its credibility and dependability in this region and
the world as a whole. If Reagan is going to retain his
office, are we to look forward to four more years of open,
unanswered attacks on Americans? The more than 270
dead Americans in Beirut should answer a resounding"
“No.” No to thi_s do-nothing policy and no to the policy-
maker . . -

One more
political choice

I sympathize with William Pier-
ce’s reluctance to vote for either
Walter Mondale or Ronald Reagan
The Pitt News [Sept. 17, 1984], butI
must question the wisdom in writing

in Gary Hart as a protest vote.

First, there are Hart's “new
ideas,” which are by no means new;
in fact, one could argue that Hart is
the greatest apologist for govern-
ment intervention since Benito
Mussolini.

His opposition to the Chrysler
bail-out was not based on adherence
to capitalism’s principle of laissez-
faire, but. rather-because the pro-
posal did not give the government
the right to tell Chrysler what to do
with its profits — a right no govern-
ment has in a free society. '

Second is Hart’s membership in
the Democratic party. The Demo-
crats have given us four major wars;
its bureaucracies are most responsi-
ble for our economic woes (the

inﬂation-causing Federal Reserve _

System and the Internal Robbery
Service, the IRS, to name two), and
a myriad of wasteful programs
which, in the name of “fairness," are
the reason why the government
spends so much of its resources tak-
ing money from people who earn it
and giving it to people who don’t.
This, of course, is consistent with
“progressivism,” a philosophy
which insists that to need is to
deserve, but to earn is to steal.

Finally, since Hart is a defender of
the welfare state, he poses no serious
challenge to “politics as usual,” and
therefore offers no real alternative to
either Reagan or Mondale. All in all,
he could even be worse. If Mr. Pierce
wants to cast a protest vote, let him
join me in voting for a, candidate
who does offer such an alternative:
the Libertarian candidate, David
Bergland.

Letters to the Editor

Support the
home team

In light of the recent puns I have
read in The Pitt News, and the nega-
tive attitudes I have been hearing, I
feel compelled to take a stand and
defend the Pitt football team.

First of all, let us not forget whom
we are dealing with here. The foot-
ball players are college students.
They are young men who practice
every day and go out every Saturday

. to play football the best way they

know how. Do you think they enjoy
losing? How satisfying can it be to
walk off a football field after losing a
game, when you know in your heart
that your team was better and
should have won? Everyone at Pitt
seems to have forgotten that the
players and the coaches do not like
to lose either. Losing has not ‘been
the recent tradition here at Pitt.
With the way everyone has been
talking, one would think that the
football team has been losing on
purpose.

Granted, I may be a little biased. I
am a devoted Pitt football fan and I
have several friends who are
members of the team. I still see no
need to sit in Pitt Stadium and boo
the players as they leave the field.
Talk about fair-weather fans. It
would be a different story if Pitt
were 3-0.

Now is when the Pitt Panthers
need your support. When they take

the field on Saturday against WVU,-

those players need to hear that we
are behind them. If you cannot cheer
for your team — and for many of
you, your friends -— then what is the
point of attending the game? I, for
one, will be at the game ready to
support the players. Yes, I will be
wearing blue and gold and my “Pitt
is it" button as always. Whether we
are 0-3 or 3-0, I would rather be a

From where I stand/ G1€I1I1C11mmiT1g5

Pitt fans: stand fast and support athletes

The editorial staff of The Pitt
News deserves congratulations. In
its Sept. 24 issue, the staff called on
students not to give up on the 1984
football team or Coach Foge Fazio.
Criticism ofthe 1984 team and Fazio
has been extensive and often
unjustified. .

Granted, Pitt’s 0-3 start is a major
disappointment, but perhaps the
Pitt Sports Information Depart-
ment did the team and fans a disserv-
ice by pushing Pitt too high in the
rankings. With high rankings come
high expectations. Fazio stated pub-
licly that he was surprised with a
number three ranking. Although
Pitt might have finished in the top
five, or even won the National
Championship, it would have done
so on young talent. The starting
lineup shows that only eight seniors
start as compared to 16.. seniors in

ball, but they have not put it in the
endzone. For example, in the open-
ing game, Pitt ended the first half at
the BYU l—yard line. With the score
21-l0 against Oklahoma, a Pitt drive
ended at the Sooners’ 12-yard line.
Finally, in the third quarter at Tem-
ple, a Pitt drive stalled inside the
Owls’ 10-yard line. Fazio can be crit-
icized for not developing a killer
instinct in the offense when it is
inside the opponents’ 20-yard line.
But Fazio and his whole staff
must be praised for providing some-
thing that for so long was lacking in
the Pitt program —— stability. Des-
pite the success _of Johnny Majors
and Jackie Sherrill, Pitt was a step-
ping stone in their careers. Recruits
recognized that. In 1976, a highly
recruited 6—5,_250-lb. lineman from
West Mifflin told me he would (and

did) go to Penn State, rather than
Pitt, because, “you know Paterno
will never leave Penn State, but
Johnny Majors might be gone
tomorrow.”

Other coaches of college football
today lack loyalty to their univer-
sity. For example, Howard Schnel-
lenberger, former coach at the
University of Miami, promised a
recruit from Oregon, who.S'chnel-
lenberger called the finest recruit in
the school’s history, that he (Schnel-
lenberger) would never leave Miami.
Moreover, Schnellenberger told the
recruit that he would be his surro-
gate uncle, brother, even father.
When Schnellenberger sold out to
the big bucks of the USFL, the
recruit lamented, “I’ve just lost my
whole family in Florida.”

Fazio, a former All-‘America line-

backer at Pitt, will not leave the uni-
versity. His sincerity is the major
reason for his success as a recruiter
— over one-half of this year’s team
are Fazio’s recruits and prior

recruits i_nclude Tony Dorsett and‘

Dan Marino, who were the founda-
tions of past winning teams.

Finally, one cannot forget last
year when predictions of a 4-7 sea-
son ended in a 8-3-1 record. If only
that year were Fazio’s first as coach,
we’d all be hailing him as the savior
of the program. -

Tomorrow is the critical game.for__  

the 1984 season. It's time for Pitt.

fans to show our loyalty. It is es_sen- I I *
tial that fans yell and shout West I .
Virginia out ofthe stadium. Perhaps « I '5
such support would .provide the .. '
team with the energy neededto turn,-
this season around. For if this sea- .
son can be turned around, a team ‘ ‘
character will be built that no unde-p .

feated season could bring.

Sex lecturer meets press

-‘eauoniacream  ’

By Christian Gauthier
The Pitt News

After her lecture and the signing
of autographs (my own included),
Dr. Ruth began a short press confer-
ence (rescheduled due to late arrival)
before rushing off to a reception
hosted by the Pitt Program Council
Tuesday night after her lecture. -

“Okay, shoot,” she jumped in
with as soon as we were settled,
showing the brisk, down—to-business
persona that has made her famous.

“I did finish two manuscripts,”
she said in answer to The Post-
Gazette’s question about her books.
“One is for children — junior high
and high school —- to be called
something about loving. _The other
will be specifically about sexual dys-
functions so couples will be able to
get self-help before‘. they see a sex
therapist.

“Not everybody can go to a clinic
or go to a sex therapist," she said.
“So it’s about helping a woman hav-
ing an orgasm or [a problem with]
premature ejaculation so people can
first try to help themselves." A

She believes there has not been
any regression in sexual attitudes. “I
believe it should be a combination of
parent, ‘school, church" and syn-

agogue [in discussing sexuality],"
. which-is the current attitude.

\.

  
 

When asked if her children’s book
would provoke more giggling, she
said “... I believe in giggling, because
even if they giggle, [they will
remember]. I say it’s all right  to be
taught and learn about and to wait
until the right time for you [the stu-
dent or child]"; however, she wisely
refrains from putting a specific age
to “the right time."

I asked her if she thought college
students could better help the fight
against venereal disease and
unwanted pregnancies by taking up
the fight (and spreading the work)
among themselves.

“Absolutely  I believe everyb-
ody should really get with it and
should fight for better contracep-
tives and should watch out that the
“Squeal Law” (an unsuccessful fed-
eral bill which would have required
notifying parents whose children
avail themselves of federally spon-
sored clinics before services are
given) doesn't rear its ugly head.”

On the touchy subject of abortion,
she is of the opinion that “abortion
should remain legal.” She is not a
moralist or a theologian, so save
your angry letters for someone else!
She is a realist: one and a half mil-
lion unwanted babies annually is too
much.

There are no new contraceptives
in the offing that sh_e would recom-
mend. She seems wary of altering
the body’s hormonal'le'vels.

_ . Lets Getcrazv-

“I’m interested  in what the most
people are concerned about [includ-
ing the 700 plus who attended the
lecture]. I am not interested in any
esoteric! I know the esoteric makes
headlines, but I am not interested in
that.”

Her success “... is because I’m with
two feets on the ground ...” she said.
She loves TV and the lot, but “I keep
up my university affiliation; I go
every week to my seminars. I keep
up my privatepractice  and part of
it [is because] I’m interested in what
can happen in everybody’s house.”
Not in blessed “esoterics”!

When a Pitt News reporter asked
her whether her ability to speak
explicity came from her education,
clinical practice or from within her-
self, she responded, “I think it’s
something within myself, but it is
based on the clinical and the expe-
rience  perhaps a little bit on my
accent.”

She never had time time to lose
the accent because of studies'and
family.’l think we. all love her just a
bit more for her charming accent
and joie de vivre (and perhaps her
“Joy of Sex").

“One more?" she asked, and sh
got a good one. —

Have college students‘ attitudes
swung them away fromjumping into
sexua_l relationships?

And what follows is a resounding
“Yes. People really do want relation-
ships  from my character observa-
tions, yes  a definite trend toward
romanticisms  I’m happy with
that! I’m really old fashioned. I
believe people want relationships;
that’s what they want, not [just]
what I think.” Perhaps we're
back to looking for Mr. (Mrs.) Right
and. not “Mr. Goodbar.” \ -

Nice, huh?

Panelon
buslane 

As most anyone who frequents
the Pitt campus is aware, there
has been an inordinate number
of traffic accidents involving
pedestrians on Fifth Avenue
recently. Three of theseaccidcnts
have occurred since the begin-

. ning of this fall semester.

In order to gain insight into
this problem and discuss possible
solutions, five people from var-
ious Pittsburgh organizations
gathered Thursday for a panel
discussion.

. Those involved in the discus-
sion were as follows: Maureen
Hogan of City Planning, Tom
Litke of Port Authority Transit,
Officer Charles Grier of Pitt
Public Safety Department,
Angelo Satereanos‘, vice presi-

,vden_t of the Resident Student

Association, and Avery Abrams,
a Student Government Board-
member’:

The discussion was moderated
and taped by WPTS-FM last
,Wednesday but will not be run
until Sunday night at 8 p.m.

On film and

by Adam Eisenstat

Pittsburgh, a city consumed by
bland, mainstream concerns such as
Renaissance II and football, got a
strong dose of underground culture
last weekend when outre filmmaker
Jack Smith staggered into town.
Smith appeared at the Carnegie
Museum of Art on Friday and Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers on Saturday,
where he screened Flaming Creatures
the only underground/experimental
film ever banned in New York City —
along with Erotic Landlordism of Crab
Lagoon and I was a Male Yvonne DeCarlo
in the Lucky Landlord Underground.

Many came to the screenings to see
Flaming Creatures, which was made in
1963 and influenced the world sleaze-
/camp/bizarre genre of films, whose
purveyors include Andy Warhol
(with whom Smith has worked) and
John Waters.

Flaming Creatures, in faded, often
overexposed black and white, is a 45-
minute excursion into semi-
controlled non-narrative lunacy.
Transvestites cavort about in gang
rapes and orgies, wiggling flaccid
penises and huge breasts in creature-
crammed close—focus shots. This
hyperstimulation of the screen as
well as the senses is set to melodra-
matic music, sometimes pop songs,
which are totally at odds with the
image. The camera work often looks
as if the cameraman was an amphe-
tamine addict with an acute nervous
disorder.

To seek any kind of profound mes-
sages in Flaming Creatures, such as the
decline of Western civilization, or
maybe the role of sexual confusion in
modern society, is probably forcing
the issue. None of Smith's films really
”mean” anything. They are basically
eccentric comedies that celebrate the
joys of insanity and amorality, in the
most uninhibited fashion.

”If this country really did know
anything about art," said Smith,
”they would know the prime quality
in art is lightness, not heaviness."

Smith, who calls his work ”moldy”
art, often gives wildly eccentric per-
formance pieces in whatever apart-
ment in Manhattan he happens to be
living in. For sets and props, he uses
thrift shop fragments, garbage, and
any other urban jetsam he can get his
hands on.

Until last weekend, Smith's films
had not been seen outside of New
York for 15 years, when he removed
them from distribution. Smith insists
on being present when his films are
shown because film distributors
want ”to have you dead and take the
film away from you They want you
to give your films to them so that
they can do your traveling for you.
It's all in the way of ‘get.’ ”

. I At both screenings, Smith, (sort of)

answered "questions from the
audience. No one knew what to
expect from this mad bohemian. The
Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ description
of the program said Smith ”has long
been renowned for the spontaneity
and intensity of his live
performances.” ,

Spontaneity? Certainly. Intensity?
Performance?

As was evident to everyone in
attendance, it's a long haul from the
decadent New York underground of
1963 to Pittsburgh in 1984. On teet-
ering legs, Smith free associated, in a
voice not unlike that of a record at 78
speed, on a wide range of topics, from
his vitamin and nutrition kick to
cures for baldness and acne and, oh
yes, film.

Showcase, Friday, September 28, 1984

nutrition

When asked about his approach to
sound editing, Smith garbled a sen-
tence, then was silent for about 30
seconds.

”Sometimes when I get tired, my
mind just stops,” he croaked. ”You
can't be tired when you show up at
the theatre. This is why.

”Anything I say could be attributed
to mercury poisoning in my silver
fillings.”

Someone asked if he had influ-
enced Warhol. Smith said ”Yeah.
Sure.” Ten second pause. ”I also fer-
tilized Fellini  Someone told me
they saw him in Italy and asked him if
he had ever heard of Jack Smith. He
told me Fellini said ’The name rings a
bell.’ I said ’Yeah, a dinner bell’ .”

Smith talked at length about his
new Vitamix food processor and the
recent awakening of his nutrition
consciousness. ”I’ve been concentrat-
ing on .my health in the last few years.
Two months ago, I started a rejuve-
nation process.” (It didn't seem to be
working last weekend.)

In a few lucid moments, Smith
touched on his unconventional
approach to filmmaking and his dis-
satisfaction with the current state of
film.

”All the obvious things have been
done in movies. I don't want to go on
making the same movie over and over
again. I have to put things in my next
project that have never been done in
film before.

”When the sound foolishness
[sound movies] started, they aban-
doned the art of the silent movie,
which was telling a story with
pictures.”

The other films which were shown
along with Flaming Creatures used
records for the sound track with seg-
ments of pop music, sound effects
and Hollywood documentaries —
none of which had any overt connec-
tion with the screen images.

Smith also talked about the wond-
ers of the Bolex camera, then paused
for a bit and said ”Bananas have 80
calories. I know how to cure baldness.
I've been working on my own hair
and have had a 25 percent improve-
ment. You take witch hazel, Iso-
pheryl alcohol and a little chloresteral
— even that's enough, and you use a
vibrator to grind it into your scalp.

”Baking soda is the only thing that
will take the smell of cat piss out of
rugs. I use it to brush my teeth.”

Following Friday's screening at the
museum, museum film curator and
sponsor of the program, Bill Judson,
intimated that the following night's
program would be more spontaneous
and dynamic. At Filmmakers, Smith
took questions for about ten minutes
and spent another two or three min-
utes wandering around looking
exhausted and confused. He walked
up the aisle, stopped and chuckled,
then he thanked everyone and left.

Jack Smith might easily be seen as a
mere casualty of the '60s. Perhaps,
though, he was just bored. In any
case, he is quite an anomaly in this
age of practicality and insipidity. It's
almost as if he were one of his film's
creatures, transplanted into Terms of
Endearment or a sterile, soulless Spiel-
bergILucas film.

He may not have done any of the
zany theatre which had been written
and talked about, but this probably
wasn't the place for it. He did provide
glimpses of his utterly irrational,
absurd creative capacity. Anyone
willing and able to loosen the relent-
less grasp of symmetrical, formulaic
art is rare today. For this we should
be grateful to Jack Smith.

A thoughtful Jack Smith in the days of Flaming Creatures.

by Jeffrey Sewald

Pittsburgh Public Theatre has
never won any ribbons for its cushi-
ness. Then again, it is difficult to
complain when the company consist-
ently stages some of this city's most
noteworthy productions. But just
imagine it. Public Theatre‘  with
comfort, too 

Go ahead. Stretch those legs.
Straighten that spine. With their
Tenth Anniversary Season getting
underway on Oct. 3, Pittsburgh Pub-
lic Theatre has struck the old set with
an expensive renovation and signed a
new leading man.

What the Gardner" saw

Enter stage left. A soft-spoken,
bald-headed man with a tiny moust-

ache and baby-blue eyes. Bill

Gardner. Holder of the newly created
position of Producing Director, a dual
post that combines both managerial
and artistic operations.

"It gives me a greater responsibil-
ity," remarked the 49-year-old native
of Troy, N.Y. "Once the organization
is running the way I would like it to
run, then I can devote more time to
the artistic end.” A

The title of Producing Director is
not new to the theatre world as a
whole, but it is definitely a change for
Public Theatre. Gardner has become
the theatre’s third director since its
founding in 1975, but its first with
this additional range of responsibil-
ity. Ben Shaktman headed the com-
pany from its inception until 1982.
He was succeeded in that year by
Larry Arrick, who filled the spot
through last season. _ b

"Larry was the artistic director. He
dealt with the choice of plays, direc-
tors, designers and actors, and then
followedright through. Ido that,'plus
deal with the management of the
theatre. It's simply adding a compo-
nent to the job. I've done it before, so
it isn't like I'm doing\two people's
work."

It is and it isn't. Gardner is not only
filling the artistic shoes of Larry
Arrick, but he also must squeeze into
those of Dennis Babcock, the com-
pany’s former managing director
who resigned last May.

"With the business, the offices will
be running pretty much as they
always have, once the routine is set.
But the artistic side always starts
fromrscratch. I always have to give a
certain amount of time to it because
when you're doing a play, you're
always starting from square one or
two, depending upon how many of
the people you've worked with
before. Put a play and people together
and see what happens."

Bill Gardner has been putting peo-
ple and plays together for more than
a decade. As producing director for
the Academy Festival Theatre in Chi-
cago from 1973 to 1978, Gardner
staged 24 major productions, includ-
ing Eugene O'Neill’s /1 Moon For The
Misbegotten featuring Colleen
Dewhurst and Jason Robards. The
production, directed by Jose Quin-
tero, ultimately received four Tony
Awards. Most recently Gardner filled
the role of producing director at the
Adelphi Festival Theatre in New
York, where his productions included
Joe Orton’s What The Butler Saw, star-
ring Wayne Rogers and Carrie Nye.

eradication of these ills.

The leg room of the past left a lot to
be desired. A crampy 2.9 inches, by
theatre standards, was 4 inches less
than the norm, and an orthopedic
problem for drama nuts taller than
5-7. With the renovation, _the existing
leg room is now a spacious 35 inches
(simple math reveals this to be 2
‘inches above the average — a definite
step in the right direction). But addi-
tional leg space is not the only new
feature this season. Alas, where hath
all ye scaffolds gone?

That precarious black scaffolding

were situated is now history. Instead,

cantilevered balconies supporting
two rows of seats have been placed
along two sides of the house, and a
fixed raked balcony, five rows deep,
has been installed at the entrance
end. As a result of the new design,
there are no "bad" seats in the house.
Patrons will be able to assume a more
natural sitting position and be able to

look directly toward center stage
from any given seat. You needn't be a
contortionist to catch the action this
season. But what, you ask, will be the
main result of all this jostling about of
fixtures and respacing of seats?
Would you believe an increase in
capacity?

"It’s somewhere between 40 and 50
more seats," explained Gardner,
speaking of the renovation he spear-
headed. "That will allow us to
shorten the runs of the shows to, let's
say, 5 weeks." ,

In the past, Pittsburgh Public
Theatre has always required an 11-
week commitment from its actors.
That translates to nearly 3 full
months away from ‘New York or
some other major theater capital,
which is closely akin to putting a kink
in the hose of a life support system.
The longer the duration of the kink,
the more risk of damage, to the per-
forming career, in this case. By
increasing the seating capacity, it is
now possible to serve the same
number of patrons in a shorter length
of time. With shorter runs, the
theater may be in a position to solicit
the talents of some top-flight actors
who would normally balk at the pre-
vious 11-week stint.

"We and all the other theaters in
Pittsburgh are barely touching the
audience. We're reaching a very min-
uscule section. When there are about

‘ 2.5 million people in our area and we

have about 14,000 subscribers, and
the other theatres have anywhere
from 50 to 500, I would say that, basi-
cally, whatever we do, we'll help the
other theaters develop their audien-
ces, and they'll do the same for us.
If we shorten the runs of the shows
and the quality of acting improves,
it's going to improve everywhere
because actors seeing other good
actors get better them_selves."_ '

— A friend on Bruce Springsteen

  Anyone who doubts that rock 'n'

roll can change a person's life or pro-
vide a dream where before there was

‘ .only‘a destiny has never bothered to

see Bruce Springsteen perform live.
I Pittsburghers had plenty of oppor-

 tunity to erase those doubts last

week. Springsteen performed two

 sold-out Civic Arena concerts last
Friday and Saturday night, during

' which he captured the hearts and voi-
ces of 34,000 people, clutching them

‘The night before, he did the same

 with a ”Beer Blast” crowd of 200 peo-

 “ple at the Decade in Oakland.

those that filled the arena last week-

Unlike most rock stars who have

consequences it brings -— Bruce
Springsteen doesn't go back to places
like the Decade.

I Both Springsteen and his early
audience were determined to main-

the experience of seeing and hearing

his music so special. They understood
that. the magic of rock 'n' roll was
bigger than both of them.

Their shared ideal that rock can be
a motivator has allowed Springsteen
the time to maintain his artistic integ-
rity while keeping his audience
patient in between albums and
appearances. His ability to sustain
that ideal emerged the minute he
ducked under the beam that cuts the
Decade stage in two and joined the
band in a rendition of Eddie Floyd's
1967 rave-up ”Raise Your Hand."

find some reasons to believe

Street at what the Decade's owners
presumptuously, but for once cor-
rectly, call the corner of rock 'n' roll.

DUE]

It didn't take long to realize that
Bruce Springsteen had more than
rock 'n' roll on his mind when he
stepped to the microphone Friday
night to introduce a series of songs
from the Nebraska album.

The thought that he would turn 35
on Sunday did not seem as unsettling
as something he had heard on the
evening news.

President Reagan apparently was
attempting to align himself with
Springsteen while campaigning in
New Jersey by suggesting that they
spoke with one voice for a better
America. The president's ploy
obviously struck a nerve.

”I don't know what he's been lis-
tening to, but I don't think it's
Nebraska," Springsteen told the Civic
Arena audience.

Then the stage lights fell and the E
Street Band's new guitarist Nils
Lofgren started the rhythmic and
haunting chords of ”]ohnny 99,” a
story about how an honest man can
be pushed to the execution line by a
long streak of bad luck.

Springsteen would later mention
how our government seemed bent on
taking from those who needed the
most and giving it to those who
needed the least.

These outward attempts to distin-
guish between his message of indi-
vidual pride and self-respect in the
face of despair (evident in songs like
’’Promised Land" and "Badlands”) and

the hollow cries of a growing nation-
alistic unity currently sweeping the
country were significant and would
continue the next night.

But Springsteen made his reply to
the president short and to the point
and then deftly moved on to deliver a
manic show filled with three and a
half hours of rollicking good fun and
dancing.

The opening numbers of the
second set — a string of hits including
"Hungry Heart," ”Dancing In The
Dark," ”Cadillac Ranch” and ”Sherry
Darling” —— were only a preview of
the level of frenzy and celebration the
crowd would later experience.

A spontaneous chorus of "Happy
Birthday" rang out from the upper
decks Friday right before Springsteen
and the better-than—ever E Street
Band tore into ”Born To Run.”

The encores each night included
the trademark ”Detroit ‘Medley/’
along with the E. Street Band's dis-
tinct version of the Ilsey Brothers’
classic ”Twist and Shout.” In
between, pieces of ”Midnight Hour,"
"Travellin Man,” and The Contour’s
”Do You Love Me.7”.

By the time the second night drew
to a close, the man they call ”The
Boss” had turned 35 years old.

He introduced ”Born To Run” Sat-
urday with a word of thanks.

”I’m fortunate that I get to live out

a little bit of my dreams every night,"
he said. "Here’s to hoping that you
get to live. out a little bit of yours.”
I The house lights came on and
17,000 pairs of waving arms seemed
to suggest that at least for a night, all
that they had hoped for came true.

Pointer

by Jim Hohman

I didn't get to see Bruce Spring-
steen. Mind you, I wanted to. But the
final decision was made by the wallet.
To help me get over my depression, I
picked up a couple of tickets for the
Pointer Sisters concert, hoping that it
would be some consolation. It was.
Sure, I missed Bruce (I wasn't at the
Decade either), but I got over it the
moment Anita Pointer cooed,
”Darling, don't say a word, ’cause I
already heard what your body's say-
ing to mine.” Sigh!

Anyway  (where was I?) when I
first got to the Carnegie Music Hall,I
was expecting a good concert. I'd seen
the Pointer Sisters on TV and knew
they would put on a good show —
tame, but good. I wasn't expecting the
passion and fire the sisters put into
their songs  -but that comes later.

The opening act, Tim Wilmorth, a
CMU mime, warmed up the joint
CMU-Pitt crowd with an appropriate
number of jokes and gags about each
of the two schools (Pitt's football
team, CMU's school colors, etc.) and a
wonderfully rude imitation of Katha-
rine Hepburn (”see this battery on
my shoulder?”) — you can guess
what follows. However, as he himself
admitted, mime is not the most excit-
ing thing to watch for a half hour, so
when he finished, the crowd grew
excited at the prospect of an hour of

Perfect

good pop/soul.

Coming onstage to a cheering
crowd and bluesy piano riff, the
Pointers opened with ”Happiness,"
looking very sharp and sounding the
same. At first, the crowd's excite-
ment seemed to diminish from what
it had initially been, but with "Slow
Hand” played early in the set, it rose
to a high level that was maintained
throughout the rest of the concert. (I
guess other guys feel the same wayl
do about that song.) Anita deftly gave
the vocal just the right touch of
vulnerability and eroticism while
Ruth andjune backed her up, rubbing
their thighs in a wickedly sexy way.

After ”Neutron Dance” from the
Breakout lp, they turned the clock back
and performed the songs that reig-
nited their careers after the slump
following ”Steam Heat” (remember
that one.7), starting with ”He’s So
Shy" and ending with ”Fire.” (So at
least I got to hear some Bruce). Then it
was back to Breakout for ”I Need You”
and a couple others. ”Automatic,”
which soon followed, had the whole
crowd on its feet —— and yes, Ruth
really can sing that low; it's no studio
trick.

”I'm So Excited” and ”]ump,” the
last two songs, were simply the icing
on the cake, both performed with an
energy not matched on vinyl. Even
sound problems during "]ump”
(June's mike went out) didn't stop the

Maybe it was mutual admiration,

their fair turn at the mike, and all
three made an effort to please the
audience and have a good time. After

The Blue Ridge Mountains were
painted a vibrant hue. Over by Mor-
gantown the West Virginia Moun-
taineers had just begun_ to sink their
teeth into the season’s schedule by
having Ohio and Louisville as appet-
izers. The 68-6 combined mauling
only added to the natives’ satisfac-

tion of still seeing their team at home.

five more times on a schedule that

only calls for four road games.
Head coach , Don Nehlen had

found a quarterback in Mt. Legan-

on’s Tony Reda, though the fifth- 

year coach seemed disoriented over
many dropped passes. Nonetheless,
All-America placekicker

name in the recordbooks, Monro-
_eville’s John Gay had picked up 164
yards and three touchdowns on a
low 17 carries to lead the team and a
defense that lost seven starters last
year was, well, holding the scoring
within respectable boundaries.

A road game against Virginia
Tech beckoned and Nehlen was try-
ing to shoo away the expected, pre-

' game overconfidence that comes
from two dominating wins. He
looked the part of a paranormal
society member intent on eradicat-
ing ghostsifrom haunted houses.

Well, the roof kind of caved in
after WVU escaped with a 14-7 win.
Gay only picked up 31 yards‘ before
injuring an ankle and several days
later WVU’s top receiver ‘Rob Ben-
nett (nine receptions, I 38 yards) was
indefiitely suspended for public
intoxication and defecation. A loss
to Maryland last week at home sud-
denly plunged a program with direc-
tion into uncertaity as it readied to
face Pitt tomorrow on the road.

“I wouldn’t say I’m satisf"ied,”'

Nehlen said of this 3-1 team. “Not
even if we were wining games 10-0.
My philosophyis this: we all win, we
all lose. It's always a team effort.
[The tailspin] has been a comg1o-
meratiop of things. There've been a
ton of reasons. Quarterback is one
of them. The punter isn’t punging,
there’s clipping, there’s dropped
balls.”

The big question since last year’s
9-3 team folded has been who is to
replace quarterback Jeff Hostetler.
Both Reda and Kevin White saw
playing time during Hoss’ reign, but
their basic function was keeping the
headsets snugly fiton the sidelines.
White has since emerged as Hoss’
successor, but he's been far from
impressive ever ‘since replacing a
similarly mediocre Reda. ‘

 Competition with co

 By Laurie Kubli

The Pitt News

Their goal is to win every one of
six matches this weekend, according
to their coach, but be careful not to

jump to the conclusion that the Pitt .

women’s volleyball team is stomping
on the thin ice of conceit. The spik-
_ ers won nine of 10 games against
these same teams last season in mas-

tering the Big East Southern Div- .

— ision tournament, which they intend

 to do again tomorrow and Sunday

at Seton Hall.
“This is our last match to prepare

0 ‘for playing nationally-ranked

teams, next weekend," said fifth-
"year coach Shelton Collier. “We're
_f .,not only trying to win matches, but
to continue to develop so we’re pre-
pared to play teams that will proba-

I " ably be ranked in the Top ten to

 

 

 

       

fifteen. ”

The team travels to Tennessee to
take on Nebraska, Texas and Ten-
nessee in two weeks. Their oppo-
nents this weekend are conference
rivals Georgetown, Villanova and
Seton Hall. ‘

The preparation Collier is refer-’
ring to is one of duration. “We have‘

,, a small roster that will be tested to

maintain a high level of intensity
throughout the tournament,” he
explained. “We play three best-of-
five matches Saturday and three
more on Sunday, It could be very
taxing, considering we could play 30
games and we have no replacement

for Ulana Kohutiak and Sue
Hoover, who have shoulder
problems.” i ’

Collier said that the six-hour drive
could be a factor, in addition to the
problem of having a small roster.
The coach is also looking for
improved serving, which he said was
not up to par last weekeknd. “Tradi-
tionally, we've had one of the strong-
est serving teams but this ‘year we
haven’tspent as much practice time
on it. .

“In our big matches we look to the
seniors to help us win —— Ulana,
Cathy Rupp, and Pat Belcher —— but

we will also be relying on our .

younger ‘players to play major
roles," Collier remarked.

Rupp sees the tournament as an
opportunity to show the rest of the
Big East teams who’s boss. “Once
again, we. need to leave no question
in our minds and to establish in their
minds that we're going to-be on top.
If we prepare right, we’ll play well.

Belcher is confident but cautious.
“We can’t take the other teams
lightly, but we’ll be ready for what-
ever comes along."

‘ Collier said that there are three

important types of games for his_

team. “One, our rivals; two, the

‘ nationally-ranked teams; and three,

our Big East competition.‘ The
games this weekend are real impor-
tant to us because they’re conference
matches and we'll have to have peri-
ods of extended concentration.”

strong WVU squad

continued from page sevemeen

Maryland held the ball for the
game’s final six minutes on its way to
20-17 victory.

These demonic curses aside,
Nehlenrefuses to admit regret over
suspending Bennett and hedges as to
whether Gay will start tomorrow.
He worries instead about a “big,‘b'ad
football team” that’s mysteriously 0-
3 so far.

“It’s the biggest, strongest, fastest

A football team we’ve faced so far”

Nehlen said. “It's much better than
Maryland. Footballis a funny game.
The ball hasn’t bounced their way.
But it’s a great team. Hell, if I was in
the meat marketing business I'd
make a fortune.” A

If anything besides his kicking
game, Nehlen, with open arms, wel-
comed back a solid offensive line.
Averaging 264 lbs., the WVU‘ line is
led by 6-7 senior Brian J ozwiak who
sports a. muhawk haircut. Sup-
posedly that makes him faster.

\

 
 
   
   
  
   
 

OPENS AT THEATRES EVERYWHERE

  

\

While pondering that, consider
two proven runners in Gay’s
absense. His replacement, sopho-
more Pat Randolph, averages three
yards a game with his third-best 173
yards. At fullback is Ron Wolfley
who averages a yard better, and is
seven in front of Randolph.

From Dr. Jekyll appears Mr.
Hyde on defense. Freshman and
sophomores startlingly dot the start-
ing lineup and are perhaps them-
selves the reason the Mountaineers
have yet to hold on to the ball longer
than they have.

“We’ve played the last two teams
and haven’t scored on anybody,”
Nehlen said bitterly “We’re just
young. When you graduate--75 per-
cent of your defense, you know
that’s going to be a problem. Plus
we’re starting three or" fourired-
_shirted freshmen.” , .

Speculation runs the gamut as to
what kind of record WVU would
bring here tomorrow; 2-2 would
have been -accepted, but 4-0 is more
the norm. One thing is certain — line
scores withstanding, the Mountai-
neers_will arrive with more of a
chance than was ever expected to
upset Pitt.

“Well, they were picked to be in
the top five," Nehlen began. “Some

' thought they’d win the national
championship and even their coach
thought they’d win it all. It’s hard for
me to believe they haven’t won a
game. On paper, they're a ‘ good

-team. It happens that BYU and
Temple were lucky. Against Okla-
homa Pitt did some dumb things in
the fourth quarter.-” ,

Don Nehlen is feeling pretty good.
About as well as each of the coaches
who’ve faced Pitt this season.

GRID BITS: West Virginia
mounted a 14-play, 90-yard drive
with justover 12 minutes remaining
in last year’s game to post a 24-2!
victory in front of a CBS TV
audience and 64,076 fans at Moun-
taineer Fiend. Jeff Hostetler scored
the winning touchdown with 6:27
remaining in the contest.

Pitt posted a similar late-game
surge two years ago when the Panth-
ers pulled a 16-13 victory a home.
Nehlen is 1-3 against Pitt after his
first team suffered a 42-14 loss in
1980 and 17-0 shutout at. Mountai-
neer Field in 1981.

WVU last won at Pitt Stadium in
1972 and has suffered a ﬁve-game
losing streak here since. The Moun-
taineers are 2-8 against the Panthers
the last 10 years while Pitt holds a
52-23-l edge in the series that began
in 1895. Only Penn State \has a
longer running schedule with‘Pitt.

For the 77th time since 1895, West
Virginia engages in some football

There are the Mountaineers with a

there are the Panthers at 0-3.

away with a 6-3 victory. Forget any
notions that they’re still Running
Back U. of the world. We don’t want
to go into any obituary type com-
ments with regard to Pitt’s mortal
deeds against Temple.

How about those Huskers?
Nebraska ran ragged (42-3 to be
exact) over UCLA. That's what
happens when the Bruins have
rough games with previous oppo-

nents San Diego State and Long

Beach State. Where do these schools
play? Maryland took everyone for a
ride and handled WVU in Morgan-
town. And what about that kid
Kevin Butler kicking footballs like
crazy for Georgia's Vince Dooley?
The kid hammered a 60-yard ﬁeld
goal in the Bulldogs’ upset of Clem-
sonin Athens.

On to tomorrow's games. The
guest guru for the week is Jim
“H.H." Hohman, the most popular
copyeditor at The Pitt News (?). “I
think that this is the week that Pitt is
going to redeem itself,” he said.
“Foge Fazio will dispel any doubts
as to his ability to coach.- Hopefully,
with a large student turnout, the
team will be motivated to send the

No matter what you see concern-
ing line scores for Pitt-WVU, don’t
believe them. There are so many ifs,
wells, 1 don’t knows, factors, and.
variables concerning both schools, it
could drive any computer crazy in
determining a winner. Just call it
“pick ’em." We don’t know how it
does it, but Nebraska keeps sneak-
ing in here as the creampuff game of

the week. Before, it was Minnesota, .

and now the Cornhuskers face Syra-
cuse. Forget that they play them in
the Carrier Dome. The only thing

Nebraska coach Tom Osborne will .
be asking his team is whether they L
can successfully grow corn under an V

inﬂatable roof.

The neutral game of the week will '1

be played in relatively nearby Giants
Stadium, where Penn State and
Texas tangle. It’s only the Long-
horns’ second game of the year and
the Lions’ fourth. Joe Paterno
obviously has a primed squad (3-0),
but maybe Texas coach Fred Akers
was right when he said maybe this
game should be played in Amarillo,
Texas —- a neutral site, he thought.

It might be difficult picking an
eventual winner in the Illinois-Iowa

game. Both schools have lost tough 4 if in

games to Stanford, against whom
the Illini lost 31-19 two weeks ago in
Palo Alto, and Ohio-State, against
whom the Hawkeyes were leveled
45-26 in Columbus.
