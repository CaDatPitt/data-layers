Against [oral Jurist 3 Charge

A body of graduate students in the School of Social Work has

thrown its support behind Dr. Marian Hathway, professor in

that

school, attacked for her political activities.

The Student Organization, rep-¢‘

resenting a portion of the some
160 students in the School, mov-
ed to back Dr. Hathway against
the charges made by Judge Blair
Gunther in a recent address.
‘Speaking to a group of high-
school student leaders, whom. he
was helping organize into a na-
tional youth organiza“.'ion_to com-
bat Communism, Judge Gunther
stated Dr. Hathway “should be
dismissed” for her left wing activ-

ities “but we have not had the

courage in Pittsburgh to do that.”

Following his remarks the Stu-
dent Organization called a special
meeting early this month.

“By unanimous vote the Stu-
dent Organization upheld the
principle freedom and supported
Dr._ Hathway as an unusually
qualiﬁed and objective instructor
who has never at any time inter-
jected any partisan viewpoints in-
to her teachings,” William Kahn,
representative of the organization

reported.

A precedent will be set tomor-

form, the apologetic Panther staff
will bring out its extra “Literary”
issue. ’ _’

This seventh issue will be the
ﬁrst attempt to put out a maga-
zine in a serious vein by any Pan-
ther staff, past or present. Ac-
cording to the Panther staﬁ, ‘__‘this
issue will contain the best short
stories, sketches, and poetry ever
included in a University of Pitts-
burgh publication.” '

A highlight of the magazine will
be two sections devoted to prize
winning photographs
standing paintings done by Pitt
students. Most of the photographs
are Pitt Photo Club selections.

Its literary selections are var-
ied. “The Benjamin,” a short story
by Les Gallagher, is" a narrative
dealing with the trials _of a trom-
bone player. John Morrissey pre-
sents White Phosphorus, a war

Ne w laboratory Facilities Set

For Animal Rese arclr Worlr

New facilities are expected to be completed sometime in July
for a special animal research laboratory on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the old

Mellon Institute.

Dr. Campbell Moses, Jr., of the medical school faculty, will be A

in charge of the new lab, which is to be the only one of its kind
in Pittsburgh. For the past year, preliminary work has been done
at a temporary lab in the same building.

The_ lab will use the latest re’
search tools to do medical research
on animals, heretofore impossible
in the city because of inadequate
facilities. ‘ '

‘Seven diﬁerent research prob-
lems of nation-wide concernare
presently in operation.

One problem, particularly vital
to Pitt, is determining whether
neutrons or other particles cause
the developrnentof eye cataracts
when individuals are exposed to
operating cyclotrons.

Two Pitt scientists have al-
ready had their eyes damaged by
the operation of the cyclotron ma-
chine located here on O’Hara
street. .

This, according to Dr. Moses, is
one of the main reasons for the
rapid _»expansion of the new lab-
oratory. ' '

Some of the other projects in-

changes in psychological tests in
correlation with Physiological,re-
sponses, study of, glaucoma,, a
common eye disease, and develop-
ment of new surgical techniques
in operation on scirrhosis’of the
liver and on bladder defects.

In anybocly’s bool<,'one of them
is Paul W. Trousdale. Said TlME’s
issue of December 2, 1946:

With a banker’s natural ‘curiosity,
‘old A. P. Giannini- wanted to meet the
32-year-old builder who had already
borrowed $30 million from his Bank
of America, and was now asking for

trip to Los Angeles, dropped in on
Paul W. Trousdafe, looked at his past
projects -and future "plans. Banker
Giannini’s curiosity was_apparently
satisﬁed, for last week Trousdale an-

million loan. I g H
Past Projects. The record which im-
pressed Banker Giannini: during. the

war the Paul W. Trousdale. Construc-

tion Co. had built 3,025 small houses,

Now it was hard at work on 2,ooO.
houses for veterans and was turning
them out at the rate of ten a day.

Paul Trousdale got into the Los
Angeles building business by way of

and the ad department of Beech—Nut.

After a year as an adman, Trousdale

took a $12 5-a-month timekeeper’s job’
with a local contractor, quit to form

his own company with a $'1o,ooo bank

loan to ﬁnance it.

'On eachproject, he and his stock--
holders put up the money to cover the
cost of real estate, got Bank of Amer-
ica loans ‘to cover all construction
costs, had little trouble getting mate-
rials by his cash-on-the-line policy.
Like most builders he formed a new

’ corporation for eachproject, dissolved

it when the project was ﬁnished. Thus
his fat proﬁts were taxable at only
2 5 % as capital gains, gave him plenty
of capital to expand..In all, he invested
some $9oo,ooo in his wartime projects,
made another $900,000. p '
Future Plans. Well heeled at war’s
end, he decided the time had come to
plunge. For this he picked one of the
best pieces of undeveloped land in

, Southern California, a 62 5-acre tract

at Baldwin Hills, -a short run from
downtown Los Angeles. -

Now, -with the Bank of _America
loan, Trousdale plans to build 8,ooo
rental units on 450 acres of it, along
with a 26-acre super-shopping center.
Eventually he hopes to build a hun-
dred I3—story apartment houses on the
. « rest of the land.

Pitt closes a successful tennis campaign tomorrow against Al-
legheny college on the Arsenal courts. The ﬁrst match is scheduled

for 3 p. m.

C

Allegheny should give the Panthers a stiff Vbattle.“The Gators

Five Panthers will conclude
their varsity tennis careers against
Allegheny. They are: J ue Rauter-
kus, Walt Schoenbaerger, Dick Ho-
gan, Ralph Mason, and Fred Sun-
day. '

Whether the Panthers win or
lose on Wednesday, they will still
have the best record of any Pitt
net team in the last decade. The
present record is ten wins and two
losses. _

As far as last Saturday’s match
-is concerned, Pitt would just as
soon forget about it. »

Intramural Sports Match Face

Of Soaring Varsity Program

By STANLEY SKIRBOLIS

With Pitt varsity sports on the
upswing again, intramural sports
are also climbing.

Under the splendid direction of
Leo Bemis, the IM program has
tremendously. N ew
sp orts have ’
been added and
old ones "re-
vitalized. Even
with curtailed
playing facili-
ties, all sched-_
uled g ames
were run off. 

T h is p a s t
year has seen a
greater interest
in the all-cam-
p u s playoffs
than ever before. Gold, six-inch
trophies were individually pre-
sented to the all-campus winners,
something that no other school
does.

With his eye

Hamilton

on the future,

Bemis hopes to have “alarger in-
ter-coordination of available fa‘-
clities.” Perhaps 1n 1950 ‘or ’51
the ﬁeld house will be completed,
-giving a wider scope to IM sports.

There has been quite an im-
provement over the previous year
