Five SGB candidates
take to the air

News Assistant

Five candidates rimning for
the SGB and the SGB presidency
took another opportunity, this time
on Tuesday afternoon, to stand in
front of the microphone and
answer questions from their peers.

Unlike last Wednesday's
"Meet the Candidates" forum,
though, they couldn't even see
who was serving up the barrage of
inquiries.

Joe Gielata and Damon
Hudac, both of the Gargoyle
Party; SGB presidential candidate
Shannon McCabe, and board can-
didates Geoﬂrey Broz and Marc

Vﬁsnosky were guests on Steve "

"Gasman" Gasowski's WPTS talk
show. The candidates ﬁelded

« _questions from both callers and

Gasowski.

According to Hudac, appear-
ing on the talk show was his idea.
Earlier, Hudac told all the candi-
dates at the "Meet the Candidates"

forum that the Gargoyles were
planning to be on the radio show
and that others were welcome to
join them.

Of the 20 candidates running

for SGB or SGB president, ﬁve -if

appeared on the radio show.

_ Hudac said he tried to get the
current SGB to be on the show,
too, but that its members declined.

"I guess [other candidates]
didn't care," Hudac said.

Joe Gielata, the other half of’
the Gargoyle Party, said SGB
President Justin DalMolin told
him the SGB didn't want to be on
the show because its members
didn't want to "give the Gargoyle
Party an unfair advantage."
DalMolin did not elaborate on his
comment to Gielata.

Hudac described the SGB's
reason for not being there as "lame
excuses."

"If anyone from SGB is lis-
tening," he said, "it's a good thing
you aren't here, because it would
be to our advantage."

But the SGB did get involved
when board member Marquette
Bowman stopped at The Pitt
News’ oﬂice, where a member of
the advertising staﬁ was on the
phone with the show addressing a
question to McCabe.

According to Bowman, he
"suggested questions" to the ads

staff person to ask. When a
reporter in the oﬂice attempted to
get Bowman to speak on the
phone, Bowman said the SGB
was not goingtobeinvolvedinthe

radio show.

"I was just giving sugges-

tions," Bowman said. "There was-

no gun to his head, he asked what

he wanted to as ."

Bowman later said the SGB
was going to release an oﬂicial
statement later in the day docu-
menting its side of the semester's
controversial events.

"After that, we will talk freely
with everyone," Bowman said.

Voters in 11 counties surrounding
Pittsburgh overwhelmingly defeated a
referendum that would have funded
two new stadiums and other regional
improvements by increasing the local
sales tax by 0.5 percent.

Despite the media blitz by support-
ers of the Regional Renaissance
Initiative, as of 11:00 p.m. last night,
with 9 percent of ballots still uncount-
ed, 58 percent of Allegheny County
voters decided against the initiative,
slightly more than the 57 percent of
voters in the region who rejected the tax
in yesterday’s election.

Supporters of the tax said the
Pittsburgh area would not only have
gained two new stadiums if the tax had
passed, but that the measure also would
have kept the city from deteriorating.

RADIO

In the ﬁrst hour of the show, the candi-
dates brieﬂy explained their slates and gave
a synopsis of their stands on the major
issues of the election.

After that, Gasowski opened the lines
up to callers to ask the candidates questions.

Several callers asked about the
Gargoyles’ policy on student aid.

Gielata told one such caller that there is
a lot of misunderstanding about their stand
on the issue. A i W

"Once and for all, we will not do any-
thing to inhibit" the work of the U.S.
Students Association and the University's
student Governmental Relations
Committee, said Gielata

He went on to say that he personally

opposes federal ﬁnancial aid because he has ’

read reports claiming it causes tuition to
rise.
Gielata said that ‘if ' elected, the
Gargoyles are going to work with the
Chancellor's Oﬂice to cut tuition at Pitt,
instead of lobbying in Washington or
Harrisburg to get more aid for students to
apply to climbing tuition rates.
Another caller asked McCabe what she
was going to do, besides her plan to erect a
Pitt Panther statue, if elected
McCabe said that, among other things,
she contacted a woman in Pitt's internship

FROM PAGE 1

office about improving internship aware-
ness. McCabe said the woman she spoke
with was excited about the idea. McCabe
added she would work on continuing this
idea's implementation.

One callr“. asked VV1snosky about his
anti—SGB sentiments, of which he became
known for. His sentiments have been pub-
lished in the Phoenix, a right-wing publica-
tion, for which he is the editor in chief.

VV1snosky said helrealized he was not
making Pitt a better place simply by putting
down the SGB. He said if things are going
to improve, "you have to get out there and
do it."

VV1snosky said he will resign his editor-
ship if elected to the SGB.

Before the forum was opened up to
callers‘ questions, the candidates explained
why they had decided to nm for the SGB.

Hudac said that last year, he and Gielata
would attend SGB meetings and suggest
ways to make Pitt a better place. He said
that SGB members laughed at their ideas.

According to Hudac, people told them
they should run for the SGB. In fact, he said
that Liz Wright, an SGB candidate, was one
of these people.

’ ''So next time you see Liz Wright," he
said, "make sure you thank her for getting
the Gargoyle Party to run."

REACTION

senior Umar Siddiqui said. “They should at
least have some kind of administrator
observing the process.”

Both Siddiqui and his friend, Rahil
Akhtar, a Pitt junior, were distraught ever
seeing Klayman’s actions being investigat-
ed by carnpus police and the University's
internal audit department.

As members of the Muslim Student
Association, they heard Klayman speak at
one of the organization’s functions during
his campaign for SGB president. What
Klayman said about allocating more money
to campus groups struck a positive chord
within the association and its members.

Days later, after reading news coverage
both of the probe into Klayman’s term as

' allocations chair and of his resignation from

the Allocations Committee and withdrawal
from the SGB presidential campaign,
Akhtar and Siddiqui said they felt abused.

‘They take everything for granted,”
Siddiqui said of student leaders. “Because
they are elected oﬂicials, they feel they are
empoweredto do anything. Their response
to the whole thing was very arrogant. It is
almost like they are infallible.” .

Akhtar stressed the same points and
added, “They are supposed to be the repre-
sentatives of the students. If you can’t trust
them, who can you trust?”

The investigation left many students
feeling disgusted, but many are more upset
that no one has taken the initiative to give
them a straight answer about what exactly is
going on.

And from the perspectives of many stu-

mom PAGE 1

dents, this has resulted in the SGB's image
and reputation being damaged.

“Every time you open the paper, it is
SGB doing something wrong,” Andy
Jastrzernbski, a Pitt sophomore, observed.
“Their reputation has been destroyed It is
going to take a long time for this to change,
and I don’t really think they can do anything
about it. Having new people in there will
help, but if they make mistakes, it is going
to make it even harder”,

Others agreed that the inﬂux of new
SGB members next term will improve the
student government's image and give the
leaders a fresh start.

“As far as the new people coming in,
you have to give them a shot,” Pitt freshman
Greg Klie said. “They can’t”'be guilty by
association, but they will probably undergo
much more scrutiny.”

But even with elections today and the
conclusion of student leaders‘ current terms,
many believe that the SGB is in for an uphill
battle. A

“They’ve lost my trust. It’s more trust
than respect,” Jones said. “I would like to
see them start showing us where the money
is going. I think any change is better than no
change at this point.”

And students must be part of the
change, Pitt sophomore Jason Rogers
added. "

“We must pay closer attention to the
people we elect because they are the ones
who appoint some of the positions. We need
candidates who are representatives, not
politicians.”

VOTE ,

Pitt student Scott McConnell said
on Sunday that without the tax, the
Steelers and Pirates might leave the
city, causing Pittsburgh to lose ground
economically.

"Although Cleveland did not raise
taxes, they built Jacobs Field, which
greatly enhanced the city," McConnell
said. "On the same note, the Browns
left Cleveland when the city did not
construct them a new facility, which left
the city in a slump. I'm
a die-hard Pirates and
Steelers fan. If the
teams left Pittsburgh, I
would be really upset."

Sophomore Tara
Haidze also thought
the initiative would
have been a good idea.

"The tax will
boost Pittsburgh's
economy," said Haidze
before Tuesday. "It
will definitely revital-
ize the area by bring-
ing in new jobs."

Although most
students supported the
regional tax, a few
said it wasn’t necessary, or even was
harmful.

"I think it's a regressive tax and that
this tax in particular would fund corpo-
rate welfare," said junior Josh Banta.

Jeff Chrostowski saw the upside of

« the tax but wasn’t convinced it was the

best choice for Pittsburgh.
"The tax raise will create jobs, bet-'

tering Pittsburgh. But I think we should
just renovate [Three Rivers Stadium]
instead of building a new one,"
explained Chrostowski.

Supporters of the initiative, howev-
er, emphasized that it would not simply
benefit the stadiums, and that paying
for a convention center and parks will
facilitate new corporations‘ moving into
Pittsburgh.

. "People don't understand how
much a mere 0.5—percent
tax raise will benefit
Pittsburgh." It will bring in
millions of dollars in tax
revenue, more jobs, and
the old stereotype of a dis-
mal steel city will no
longer exist," said student
Greg Egnor.

For the most part, stu-
dents agreed that the tax
would have revitalized
Pittsburgh in many ways.
They said that more busi-
nesses would relocate both
central and branch offices
to the area, that more peo-
ple would consider mov-
  ing to Pittsburgh on
account of its growing prosperity, and
that the image of a dirty, steel factory
town would be replaced by a prosper-
ous new metropolis.

"I think it will revitalize the area to
an extent, but it is not an efficient allo-
cation of resources," said student Banta.

, "They could better invest in the area,

such as in local universities."

Clinton warns Saddam Hussein to comply
with United Nations’ search of weapons

Across the Nation

WHITE HOUSE — President
Clinton had a blunt, new warning for
Saddam Hussein: Comply with U.N.
orders, and don’t shoot at U.S. recon-
naissance flights.

Clinton spoke to reporters shortly
after the Iraqi leader pushed back his
deadline for expelling U.S. weapons
inspectors. It had been midnight,
Baghdad time.

But the president said the delay
”may be just a dodge.”

He said if Saddam has nothing to
hide, he shouldn’t care who’s on the
U.N. team looking for nuclear and
chemical weapons.

As for Saddam’s threat to shoot
down U.S. spy planes, Clinton says
that would be a “big mistake.”

Clinton said he’d like the standoff
to be resolved diplomatically.

DENVER — Survivors of the
Oklahoma City bombing are telling
the Terry Nichols jury what they
remember about that day. The manag-

er of the Murray Federal Building
remembered being buried by the rub-
ble from the blast. Others recalled

again.

MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. — Steve
Everitt, a center for the Philadelphia
Eagles, has been arrested on a charge
of drunken driving. The 290-pound
center was arrested at 12:37 a.m. yes-
terday morning in New Jersey. A mar-
ijuana pipe was also found in his car.
He was released on his personal recog-
nizance, pending an appearance in
municipal court later in the month.

NEW YORK —— Nushawn Williams
says the charges against him are exag-
gerated. The man suspected of wan-
tonly spreading the AIDS virus around
New York says he had sex with only
“two or three” women in the lastyear,
not the dozens described by prosecu-
tors. He spoke in a “Dateline NBC”
interview which aired last night.

Pitt student Nicole Amrarella, who is
registered in an Aerobic Medley physical
education class, exercised with her class-
mates in Belleﬁeld Hall while a crowd of
spectators watched them stretch, jump and
sweat to popular tunes.

This was the ﬁrst such class to use the
long-awaited, lower-campus gyrrmasium
and ﬁtness center located on the second ﬂoor
of Belleﬁeld Hall at the gym's grand opening
on Tuesday.

Usually the class meets at Trees Hall,
but yesterday it decided to hold class at
Belleﬁeld for the grand opening.

"I live in Towers," said freshman
Amiarella "This gym is a lot easier to get to
than going up to Trees Hall." '

The gymnasium includes four basket-
ball nets and allows volleyball or basketball
to be played on one half of the court while
aerobics classes take place on the other side.

If students or student organizations want
to use the entire gym for basketball or vol-
leyball, they may do so when aerobics class-
es aren't scheduled. ‘ ‘

Beginning next semester, some aerobics
classes will be scheduled in Belleﬁeld Hall's

gym, according to Louis Fabian, one of the
co—directors for intramurals and recreation.
He helped establish the new gym and ﬁtness
center.

The ﬁtness center includes two Nordic
Track Walkﬁts, a Stairmaster spinnaker, a
Stairmaster ﬁeeclimber, a Stairmaster lat
pull down machine, a Stairmaster chest press
machine and a Stairmaster PecFly rear delt
machine.

By the end of this month, the ﬁtness
center will also include ‘treadmills, more
weight-lifting machines, and Stainnasters,
according to Fabian.

Although the new Belleﬁeld recreation
center has only seven machines, more have

already been ordered 

more machines each semester, according to
David Eisenberg, the SGB member who
worked with Marilyn Ross and Fabian, the
co—directors for intramurals and recreation,
to establish the Belleﬁeld gymnasium and
ﬁtness center.

As for the SGB, it bought $800 worth of
equipment for a student equipment checkout
center. .
According to Eisenberg, the equipment
includes six basketballs, six footballs, six

SGB endorsements

After a long and thoughtful process, The Pitt News has
decided to endorse the following nine people for today’s
student government election:

For president:

0 Alyson Wallach

For Student Government Board (in alphabetical order):

0 Joe Gielata

- Damon Hudac

- Jennifer Karch

0 Elizabeth Klein

0 Ellen Kyzer

0 George Mongell

0 Steven Valsamidis

0 Elizabeth Wright I

These selections were made by The,Pitt News editori-
al board. None represent a unanimous vote of the board,
though all but Wright and Valsamidis represent a majority
vote of the board.

The candidates‘ listed above have all demonstrated a
concern for interests that we feel are very important in this
campaign: reforming the allocations process, improving
two-way communication between board and students,

making the board accountable to students, and increasing ,

the range of services available to students.

Jennifer Karch, Ellen Kyzer, George Mongell and
Liz Wright have already proven their dedication to serv-
ing students, and their successful experiences on student

government should have prepared them well for the duties

of leadership. .

Steven Valsamidis supports expanding service for stu-
dents and has already begun researching his intended pro-
jects. He was also a member of theformer Allocations
Committee, and having someone serving on the new board
who understands the allocations process will be invalu-
able.

Elizabeth Klein has demonstrated leadership abilities
with other organizations, and has shown clear direction
and purpose in her campaign toward promoting program-
ming and expanded services for students.

Damon Hudac and Joe Gielata have shown their abil-
ity for and dedication to reaching out to students with their
nontraditional campaign. They bring intelligence, energy
and enthusiasm to their endeavors.

Alyson Wallach is a very intelligent and sincere indi-
vidual with a clear sense of purpose and well-thought plans
to see that purpose through. She has expressed more clear
plans than the other presidential candidates to reform allo-
cations, via a standard operating budget for SGB, and by
sitting a board member on the Allocations Committee’s
meetings. She has demonstrated an ability to see her plans
through as evidenced by the success of last month’s bon-
fire, which she organized as president of the Blue and Gold

Society.

the hardest lessons in life the
hard way; things like never sign
the 18 pages of __ﬁve-point print
before reading an apartment
lease, never assume the person
driving the car in front of yours
can’t possibly. go from 90 to 9
mph in the nanosecond it takes

I you look down to adjust the

radio station, and never trust
weather forecasts.

In an age where humans
have been able to design such
incredibly sophisticated and
useful things like microproces-
sors, fiber optics and spray
cheese, accurately predicting
the weather more than a minute
before it happens seems to be a
technological advancement well
out of our reach. After every-
thing is read and done by our
$149.32 billion web of satellites
and digitally linked up to com-
puter systems around the world,
nothing beats opening a window
to see if you’ll need a jacket.

The closely-knit society of
weather professionals has taken

a secret oath never to believe the-
. senses and always believe the

computers. In the Central states,
this vow has led to numerous
sightings of individuals seated
at their desks ﬂoating around in
the winds of twisters and reach-
ing for the power button of their
PCs ‘while reading “Weather

Predicting for Dummies”
($19.95, Guessing Press, 
pgs.).

I wonder if the temptation
for the people working on these

puters isn’t too much for them
to peek out of the dark window

. behind them as they read the

computer’s output of “Sunny.
Clear. 90 degrees,” yet hear the
panic stricken voices of thou-
sands of people outside scream-
ing about building an ark.

All in all, I think we have to
feel sort of bad for the men and
women of the weather predict-
ing profession. Despite years of
honest legitimate work in col-
lege and small, dark caves with
those magic eight balls, dice and
vials of dried newt’s tail, their
profession is often criticized as

being “illegitimate.”

And critics can be harsh on
these folks sometimes.

One theory from a person
who I shall reveal only as Mark
Nusso — to protect this individ-
ual’s anonymity —— was cen-
tered on the concept that the
Chinese Restaurant industry
directly controls the way the
weather is reported. This
“Nusso” individual claims that
all Weathermen use a master-
chart, and, based on the number
combinations from the fortunes
in their fortune cookies they got
with their lunch, issue a daily
prediction. (What a crock of Mo
Goo Gai Pan! The things some
people will say to get attention,
I’ll tell ‘ya.)

One of the aspects of mete-
orology that has always fasci-
nated me is the ability for

THE PITT NEWS

weather people to interpret the

output of those funky images-

that look like your kindergarten

art‘ projects that radar systems

spit out on an hourly basis. It

“takes some sort of training,

without a doubt, to be able to
discern what a hot-pink—and-
orange blot on a television mon-
itor means weather-wise.
Another really difficult part
of the weather forecaster’s job is
picking a suit that doesn’t blend
into the background when they
present the forecast on the
nightly news. Nothing could be

more devastating to the legiti-S

macy of a forecasting career
than appearing to the world as a
ﬂoating head and hand against a
background of the Northeastern
U.S. and telling people that it
looks like “there are some pret-
ty bad problems headed our
way.”

Meteorologists do have a
very difficult job to do. After all,
it’s not like I could simply give
you the weather prediction for
the upcoming month in
Pittsburgh if I wasn’t properly
trained in weather forecasting.

Just a short while ago President
Clinton spoke before the biennial AFL-
CIO convention here in Pittsburgh about
the importance of free trade. Over the last
few months a bitter, acrimonious debate
has broken out in Washington, D.C., and
across America over whether free trade
beneﬁts or harms America. Free trade, in
my estimation, does beneﬁt America, and
this is why: . .

John, F. Kennedy once remarked:
‘Too ‘often we hold fast to the cliches of

our forebearers  we enjoy the comfort of

opinion without the’ discomfort of
thought.” In much the same way, protec-
tionists today hold the opinion that high
trade tariffs protect American industry
from competition without carefully con-
sidering whether that supposition is true.
Otherwise, they might see that, instead of
protecting the great American job, protec-
tionism has historically been a job—killer
and the culprit of economic ruin.

In the 1930s, for example, the Smoot-
Hawley tarilf passed the U.S. Senate in an
effort, by dramatically increasing tariﬁs, to
protect America’s industrial base from the
economic downturn that was rapidly
engulﬁng the world at the time . Smoot-
Hawley failed miserably at its task.

Free trade is essential

In fact, it was free trade that helped

. pull America out of the Great Depression._

President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted
to spur the American economy by cutting
our trade barriers with other countries.
Economic historians have credited high
trade tariffs with causing several econom-
ic downturns during the 19th century as
well. I ’

But trade critics today, comfortable in
their assumptions, however wrong, seem
to ignore these facts. Congressman
Richard A. Gephardt, a leading critic of
free trade, has argued: “We must not nego-
tiate away our jobs and our living standard
based on outdated theories  about trade
and international economics ... Many
American see themselves as victims  of
trade agreements.”

Unfortunately, protectionists like
Gephardt (whose presidential ambitions
have led him to. shamelessly pander to
anti-trade groups like the AFL-CIO) are
the ones who have based their conclusions
about trade on a number of premises that
are just plain wrong.

Trade has been and always will be a
integral part of our economy. Exports are
13 percent of America’s gross domestic
product. American workers produce a
quarter of all the goods and services trad-
ed in the world, even though we possess

THE PIT NEWS

to our economy's survival

just 5 percent of the world’s population. If
we are to maintain this advantage and pre-
serve our economic edge, we cannot
afford to allow our economy to stagnate,
which is precisely what trade barriers do to
an economy.

The International Trade Commission,
for example, estimates that had the United
States eliminated all of our trade barriers
in 1993, the economy would have grown
by $15.5 billion in 1994. Because most
countries generally have greater trade bar-
riers to our goods than we have to theirs, it
makes sense for us to eliminate tariffs.
NAFTA, for example, made it possible for
America’s automotive industry to export
87,000 vehicles to Mexico, one of the
fastest-growing automotive markets in the
world. Prior to NAFTA, we were able to
export just 6,000 vehicles a year. Trade
barriers cost Americans their jobs, and
protectionists are only hurting American
workers by insisting that we as a nation
keep obsolete trade barriers that only hin-
der American growth.

As for Congressman Gephardt’s
absurd assertion that global trade agree-
ments have caused America to “negotiate
away jobs-,” nothing could be farther from
the truth. Thanks to President Clinton’s
trade policies, in the last four years 1.5
million export jobs were created in the

Wednesday, 5 November 1997

   

United States. Far from being low-wage
jobs, the workers who hold them earn 10
percent more than do their counterparts
who work at nonexport jobs. The compa-
nies involved in exports have grown 20
times the rate that other companies grow.

The facts are beyond dispute. Free
trade works and is a growing aspect of our
economy. We ignore these truths at our
own peril.

In a global marketplace, the United
States must go out and seek new markets
in which to sell our products, and trade is
a booming sector of our economy. To shut
America off from the rest of the world
would be a mistake. Far from protecting
jobs, protectionism would kill them.

By enacting trade barriers, we would
nm the risk of becoming the next Latin
America, a region with unproductive
workers, high unemployment, and an eco-
nomic system that stiﬂes creativity and job
creation with antiquated rules and regula-
tions. Our trading partners in Asia and
Europe will see America as a place too
expensive to invest in, and they will
instead go elsewhere. We cannot, and
must not, allow that to happen. Our future
depends on it.

Michael Berquist thinks that free trade is a
good thing.

Since the subject of relationships has
once again raised its wizened head (face it,
what else do you think of in college —
other than how badly you are going to
ﬂunk the midterm tomorrow that you
haven’t even started studying for?), I have
decided to be totally passe and add my
opinion to the debate, such that it is.

Most people are aware that being a
computer geek can be extremely detri-
mental to any relationship that you might
have (other than the one with your spare-
station) for several reasons. First, the
chances are that the object of your atten-
tion —-— unless, of course she is also a com-
puter geek, but what are the odds? -

probably won’t be interested in the perfor—.

mance curves of, say, the latest RISC

0 processor from Motorola versus the

Pentium II.

Imagine, as an illustration, the follow-
ing simulated conversation between a
computer geek and a non-geek (note: this
example assumes the usual pale, pattem-
balding, social-rnisﬁt computer geek and a
somewhat more weﬂ-adjusted person as
the object of his, or possibly her -— but I
doubt it —— affection. There are exceptions
to this rule, but they are so few as to fall
into the range of, say, experimental error.
So bear with me).
non-geek: “Hey.” ,
geek: “Oh, hi. Did you get‘ my e-mail?”

non-geek: “Yeah. Are you doing anything
tonight?”

geek: “Well, I didn’t have anything
planned, but remember that 8-gig IBM
hard drive I was talking about?”
non-geek: “Uh, I think so.”

geek: “It came in by UPS this afternoon. I
really have to try it out with my new ultra-
DMA motherboard this evening. I mean,
5.6 megs per second minimum transfer
rate, it should really scream. I bet it can
stream full-screen video at only, like, 7 to
1 compression.”

non-geek: “Probably. OK, are you doing
anything tomorrow night?”

geek: “Tomorrow? I have a 12-hour shift
inthelabfrom8intheeveningto 8inthe
morning, remember?”

non-geek: “Oh. Yeah, I remember. Well,
I’ll talk to you later.”

geek: “I’ll e-mail you.”

It should be obvious by this point that
this relationship is not going anywhere.
Disclaimer: Any resemblance to actual
persons, living or dead, is purely coinci-
dental. And no, this has not happened to
me. Although, I have to admit, that 8-gig
IBM hard drive looks really nice. But I
digress.

So what hope is there for the comput-
er geek? Well, being a computer geek
myself (although neither pale nor pattem-
balding), I have to say that since most rela-
tionships involve enough incompatibilities

‘ to make any software engineer cringe in

terror, it is probably best simply to transfer
your affwtion to an inanimate object more
receptive to such attention, such as your
computer. Then, later, when you have
written a key part of the latest operating
system and are ﬁlthy rich (but still a social
misﬁt), you can worry
about relationships. I
mean, it worked for
Bill Gates, didn’t it?

Altematively, you
can do absolutely bug-
ger—all about your rela-
tionships, and still sur-
vive. It is amazing
how little affection
humans need to stay
alive.. As one of my
friends recently noted:
“This pizza is better
than most sex I have  ~  
had. But then again, I haven’t had much
pizza lately.”

This of course stems from the ancient
adage that any computer geek who knows
the diﬁerence between SIPPS and SIMMS
can tell you, “At 2:00 in the morning, there
are only three important things in life (in
order of decreasing importance): pizza,
piua, and —- you guessed it —— pizza.”
And the consolation for those 12-hour
shifts comes in the form of a huge pay-
check at the end of the month. Now, you
can buy that 21-inch monitor. Or, when
implant surgery is perfected, you can buy

He said

   

a social interaction brain implant chip, and
be the life of the party. Or something.

‘You’ll need it, believe me.

But since when do rational arguments
work? Most relationships are the most
irrational things imaginable. So most of us

will continue to bash our

a sort of suicidal display
of masochism. Of course,
you say, it would make
far more sense for com-
puter geeks to attempt
relationships among their
own kind. But that’s not
going to happen anytime
soon; of the 5 percent of
computer geeks who are
female, the one or two
who one might be inter-
I A - I ~ V ested in are probably
going to be Mac proponents. Sheesh.

I’m sure Samuel Butler knew what he
was talking about when he said: “It is bet-
ter to have loved and lost, than never to
have loved at all.” The trick is to love
something that you can’t lose. Like your
computer. But what about obsolescence?

You just can’t win.

And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have
an eight-hour shift in the lab to cover.

Role-reversal for Pitt swimimers

Big East champion men lose to Syracuse, women sweep weekend

Shannon Heim

Staff Wrlter

Last weekend, in the first confer-

. ence meets of the year for the Pitt

men’s and women’s swim teams, two
close calls yielded two separate
results to the same Big East power-
house.

On Saturday, the women’s swim 1

team lapped Syracuse by a final
score of 131-112, while the men’s
team suffered a 116-124 loss to the
Orangemen.

Both Pitt swim teams came off
season opening victories, having
defeated St. Bonaventure on Oct. 31.
In that meet, the women’s 150-81
win was spearheaded by juniors Jen
Slack and Samantha Chabotar,
sophomore Jamie Tomazich and
freshman Erika Nim.

Tomazich placed first in the 1-
meter diving and second in 3-meter,
while Nim took first in 3-meter and
second in the 1-meter event. Slack
and Chabotar took first and second,
respectively in the 1000—meter
freestyle. »

In the men’s season opener,
returning Big East champions Jon

Haggerty and Brian Elko led the
team to a 146-82 victory. Haggerty
won the 100-meter butterﬂy with a
time of 51:54 while Elko, in 51:99,
took first place in the 100-meter
backstroke. _ 8

In the season’s second meet, the

women’s team repeated its efforts

with another victory.
Women’s Head Coach Marian

Cassidy-Keen said, “I am very excit-

ed with the opening of our home sea-
son. We swam pretty well and now
have a 2-0 start. Last year, we strug-
gled with both of these teams.”

The women’s team had many
highlights in this victory. Pitt’s 200-
meter free relay team took first place
with a time of 2:29.88. Also, the
Panther 400—meter medley relay took
first, with a time of 3:56.77.

In diving, Tomazich‘ won the 3-
meter event. with a score of 211.05,
and her 183.95 score also took first
in the 1—meter. Teammate‘ Nim
placed second in both events with
respective scores of 190.50 and
161.30.

“Our team strength is in dis-
tance.” said Cassidy-Keen. “We are
also starting to become strong in the

sprint freestyle. This will be the key
in winning more meets.”

The women’s team was also vic-
torious in seven individual events.
Freshman Katie Hunter won the 50-
meter freestyle in 25.19, Chabotar
took first in the 500-meter freestyle
with a time of 5:04.87, and the 200-
meter backstroke was won by Beth
Grube in 2:04.30.

The 200-meter butterﬂy was won
by Liz Perry with a time of 2:09.47,
while Erin Bissell’s 2:25.30 time was
enough to take the 200-meter breast-
stroke.

Cassidy-Keen said she was “pret—
ty pleased with the way we swam all
the way down the line. We swam as a
team. We had a little sickness, but
other swimmers stepped up and took
over:” ‘ 7

She also expressed her satisfac-

tion with the performances and lead- »

ership skills of senior Isabel Dejo
and Grube, a sophomore. She added
that she was pleased with senior
Melissa Burns, who started out
stronger in these meets than she has
in the "past.

pose is to develop new American

  Panther rugby finishes forgettable season with first win

- The Pittsburgh men’s rugby team
trounced cross-town rival Carnegie
Mellon University last weekend, 35-7,

‘and finished the season with its only

victory of the year.

Pittsburgh dominated the game in
sloppy conditions. The Panthers had a
very difficult week after’ learning of
the death of teammate Ryan
Steppacher, so they decided to play the
game and dedicate it to Steppacher’s
memory.

“It was a team effort. They played
real inspired and encouraged each

-other. That’s something we . l"..'ve.n’t

seen all year,” said Head Coach Dan
Talbert. ‘

The Panthers also said good-bye to
their seniors Saturday, many of whom
started the game. ‘

“They were in there because they
deserved it,” said .Dave Misiolek, pres-

ident of the rugby club.
‘Talbert said. the seniors played

really well even though some of them.

have seen very little game action. He
added that the high emotion of the
game helped them play well.

The backs made the difference in
the game for the Panthers, controlling
the tempo and letting the rest of the
team play the game.

“Our backs really, really played
well,” Misiolek said. .

Pittsburgh opened the scoring
‘early as Alan Bunteman scored a try
and converted to give his team a 7-0
lead. CMU responded to tie the game
7-7 before Pitt -took control.

Bunteman touched down two more
consecutive tries to put the Panthers in
the driver’s seat with a 21-7 lead.

Dan Greenblatt scored his first
career try’ before Cory Rosensteel
capped the scoring with a run of about
three quarters of the field to make the
final 35-7.

The Panthers con-
verted on all of their
point-after attempts,
which is something
they’ve not accom-
plished all year. This
is even more impres-
sive given the sloppy
playing surface.

“I’m real happy
we got 35 points, con-
sidering the field con-
ditions,” Talbert said.

“We have a good base

He added that the team
had to start from
scratch this fall, and
that next year the
Panthers should be able
to improve on their 1-5
record.

“I hope they will look

Dielfenbach has reaped the beneﬁts

their greatest success since the team’s cre-
ation in 1973.

He described Davis as “a hard work-

she keeps working hard, she will break

new stadium would be made within two
years.

Well, that deadline for stadium fund-

ing lies somewhere in February, and if

last night a signiﬁcant number of voters
did not turn out and vote “yes” on the
tax, then McClatchy has the right to sell
or move the team.

However, there is one stipulation. In
the contract that Mr. Owner signed with
the city,‘there is a clause that gives the
city of Pittsburgh a chance to look for a
prospective buyer who will keep the

team here. Starting on that date in
February, the ownership group will have
six months to ﬁnd a buyer, or should I
say sucker. .

Who the hell would want to buy th
Pirates and keep them here after the citi-
zens who are supposed to be the team’s
fans just said no to a new stadium and a
new city?

So, if you didn’t vote and it didn’t
pass, then you can be thanked for the
Pirates’ moving to Charlotte or wherever
they end up after the 1998 season.

And you can also be thanked for
Pittsburgh’s continual countdown to

becoming the next Akron —— a semi-
metropolis that has no professional
sports teams and very little else to do.

If you didn’t vote because you’re not
registered in Pittsburgh, then you’re lazy
-- all it takes is a phone call.

If you didn’t vote because you don’t
care about this region, then get the hell
out of here. ‘ .

And if you didn’t vote because you
don’t think the Initiative is a good idea,
then you’re just a moron.

Matt Townsend is the assistant sports
editor of The Pitt News.
