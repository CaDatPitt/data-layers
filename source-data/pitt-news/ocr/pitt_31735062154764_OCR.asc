_ __ Ithas ‘been extensively rumored around the campus that several of

ﬁnal count at 25-0.“ - *

In two previous seasons, in 1926

Red and Black tomorrow will not be

the Panthers last year. ~ on

" =Scored“On Once" . ‘

Up to’ date, the Wash-Jeff grid-
ders have not been beaten. They
have conquered Ohio Northern, Ash-
land, Buc_knell_,_and ‘Lafayette, and
have tied_.CarnegielTech and
Temple. The amazinglfact is that;
out of these. six -foes encountered,
ﬁve were held’.'scor'eless.l The only
team‘ to-cross their goal line was
Bucknell, which scored the only six
.points:. that have : been made against
the Presidents-.so far this season.‘
Pitt_’s_ foes have amassed a total of
twenty-three points; The Panthers
themselves have collected 202 tallies
‘as against Wash-Je1f’s 127.‘ ' 

Of the twelve games played With

Gold warriors have ;-won nine times,
lost once, and haveibeen tied twice.
In these battles Pitt has gathered in
133 points, while the Presidents’
total is a mere 39. I ,

With two victories ‘ in as many

lowing right in the footsteps of their
older brothers. They are out to make

it three straight in their game with

the Tech plebes at Connel1s_ville on
Armistice day,>Monday. , This game
is being staged under the auspices

of the American Legion, who ., are

holding a convention there and ex-
pect a crowd of approximately
15,000. ‘ _ '
The Panther cubs‘ came . out of
their game with Kiski with nothing
but a few minor. injuries,L Walton
being the only injured player. He
required, six stitches to close a»cut
in his left hand. It’ is ‘probable that
he willbe in shape for the Tech
game, so that the frosh will muster
full strength on Armistice day.-
The, Tech plebes have made an
excellent showing .to_ date, wi ping
three games and, tying one.‘ i ey.
defeafed ‘ the ' Wash-Jeff frosh, 33-7 ,'
while the, best, the ‘Pitt freshmen
could do against Wash—Jeff 2 was a
19-0 victory.’ Tech sports as very
effective passing -attack. which no
opponent has yet been able to pene-

The,-Cubs will have to stop this
passing attack if they want to con-
tinue. their winning streak- From

present indications the Tartan .fresh-

men willbe stopped bY.the stout

‘forward wall’ of the Pltthyearlings.

This season the Panther cubs boast

of one of the strongest lines of any

college freshman‘ football team.

PATENTS NEW BALLS .

The Pitt basketball team will
use .a new type of basketball
this year, designed by Dr. Carl-
son, the Pitt basketball coach.
Its ability to hold its shape is
the main feature of this basket-
ball. A hidden valve is another
feature of thefball. Dr. Carl-
son hadthese two facts in mind
when he started out to design
this basketball. Treman and
King, a large commercial ‘con-'
cern is handling the Carlsdn‘
basketball. They have had the
ball on the market for a good
many months and report a good
sale of them. I

ditches cost less; the soil is_ evenly distributed oncither

you understand the propagation method of ditch blasting?

The .Donch,es's.-Feslerf duel again
showed substantial proof that the
Pitt end is one “of Ithei outstanding
wingmen in the country. Donchess’
steadiness, his coolness underpres~
sure, and his perfect Igrace on the
ﬁeld, as ‘well as his skillfulness in
refusing ,to be taken out of plays,
actually mocked the Buckeye offen-

Uansa Scores

'I‘o Uansa goes the credit for tem-
porarily demoralizing the Buckeyes,
when, on, the second play of ‘the
game, he broke through the right
side of the Pitt ‘line and, aided by
a perfect screen of interference,

. pranced 75 yards to a score. This
sensational surprise, however, did
not completely break down the
morale of the Buckeye contingent,

' and they braced soon after. Uansa
also scored Pitt’s other touchdown,

- after" he received Rooney’s pass on
the 12-yard line, and dashed for a
touchdown. _ _ . _

_Rooney’s beautiful punting_contin-
ual1y_placed the Ohio team in dan-
ger, and this placement‘ kick in the
second period was successful, even
from a most diﬂicult an le. This
