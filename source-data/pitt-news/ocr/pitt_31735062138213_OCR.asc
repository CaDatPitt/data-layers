THE PITT

“Beware ‘ of the Blues! Beat

.. them——banish -them and ‘the rest of

the day will take care of itself."

That in a nutshell is the simple
system of philosophy advocated by
Miss Frances Richards, who plays
‘the role of Pleasure in George V.
I-Iobart’s morality_ play ‘.‘Experience,”
which will play at the Pitt theater
next week..

“A pleasant smile is the most in-
expensive investment on earth and
it is the one that‘ brings the great-
est return. How I wish every
girl could realize what it means
when she smiles. ._ I think we will
all smile» oftener than we do then.
There are always Ways, indeed, of
smiling. One may smile and not
have it mean a single thing, and
one may smile and have a person
‘ﬁeel it to his ﬁnger tips. Such a
smile isn't‘ easy,’ but what a com-
pensation one may have for the
‘trouble taken to learn it, after the
results are counted!

“I have a simple recipe for smil-
-ing. I‘ learned V it before smiling
came as easy as it does now. Some
days I smile from "force of habit,
but I really mean ‘everything my
smile «says. Here is my recipe:

‘When you are about to smile, think

first that in your smile you are
about to promise something. That
is really what’ a smile is for. It is
a promise‘, and you can make it any
kind of a'_ promise you like. The
best smile of all is the one that
promises most. No attack of the
«blues can withstand it.".,

THE GRAND

-

The screen's most astonishing
novelty, an almost indescribable
drama of the Northland, will be pre-
sented at the New Million Dollar
Grand all-next week, starting Monday
morning, December 8. It is‘ Nell Ship-
man’s production, “Back To God’s
Country,” a spectacular feature pic-
ture, based upon James Oliver Cur-
wood’s widely read story, “Wapi, the
Walrus.” Mr. Curwood is recognized
today as the nation’s leading author
of Canadian and Alaskan animal
stories. And “Wapi, the Walri1s',’= was
the greatest of them all. The picture
follows with. marvelous, faithfulness
the text of the story, detailing‘ its
drama with stirring effect and show-
ing animals in their natural haunts in
a; way that has never been approach-

- ed on the screen before.

The story of’ “Back To God’s Coun-'
try_” tells of Dolores LeBeau, who lives
with her father in the wilds of Canada.
She loves the beauty of the wood-
lands, and lavishes her affections‘ upon
two score semi-savage beasts who had
been taught by the sympathy and
bravery of her nature to love_ her.
Beasts and mountain lions, foxes, wild
cats, raccoons and many others all re-
spond to the caresses‘ of the kind-
hearted Dolores, who has grown up
among Itheny, absorbing the knowledge
that kindness to others, even animals,
But
Dolores was yet to meet Wapi, the
Killer, a great dog, vicious and strong,
descendant of a long line of piistreated
animals of the Northland. '

‘THE DAVIS
There are’. three attractions _in the
program of nine Keith vaudeville acts
thatpwilloccupy the stage in the Davis
Theater every afternoon and evening

during the week which begins Monday

matinee, December 8, which promise to
give the bill_ particular’ distinction.
They are “A. Reckless Eve,” which is
the titular headliner. “Magic Glasses,”
the second feature, and "Olympia. Des-
vall in an arena.c~ spectacle, =an at-
traction designed especially to enter-
tain the little folk. In “A Reckless
Eve" the program boasts a tabloid

inusical ‘comedy production rivaling in

gorgeous costuming, scenery and stage
effects any of =tb.e big Broadway re-
vues, and in conspicuous individual
talent, as well as collective artistry,
perhaps the_ peer of any current full-_
ﬂedged musical comedy. William B.
Friedlander is mainly responsible‘ for
“A Reckless Eve,” since he conceived
the story, wrote the lyrics, and com-

posed the music, but Will Hough. ‘

widelyvknown as a, maker of books for
plays, 7‘spun the yarn in its prose
dialogue. The ,company numbers 25.
Its-stellar players are Esther Jarrett,
Cecil Summers and Jack West. Eight
brilliant musical nunmbers weave a

lacery of melodyabout a well-deﬁned

plot in which comic « situations and
ludicrous complications are ever de-
veloped. The girls (and the cas-t and
chorus is almost entirely feminine),
are said- to beparticularly pretty and
look mighty fetching in the frocks that
have been
them. It ‘requires, in addition to the
acting company, a considerable retinue
of stage-craftsm.en to give “A Reckless
Eve” her theatrical dress."

A $50.00 diamond medal and $50.00
in gold is -the prize in the State
oratorial contest of the Texas Inter-
collegiate Prohibition , Assrociaticn.
The officers report that this asso-
-ciation _will continue the contest, but
will turn the subject matter to pro-
hibition 'enforcement and world ‘pro-
hibition. ‘ - ‘

‘ especially designed. for.

A The bitter medicine administered to Pittites by the State doctors

 st ofall, Pittites are taking the bitter dose like the good
arts hey are. T’l‘hey have nothing but words" of praise for the

exmen. ;'IL‘heyL believe in giving credit wherever credit  due.
V cond, Pittites are altruistic when they think howjoyful the '
geffolks, are over their victory.

They are always gladto see

happy, even at their own expense. There ip nothing egotistic

hem. . ,
Third, there

is that loyal,— business-like reaction of L“LWait‘ ’till

This game marked the passing of

ever wore the Blue and ‘Gold. Though
7his team was losing he gave the old
Uni all he had, ashe has always done.
‘Hats off to Andy Hastings. _

 

 . Ca.'pt.- Higgins of . State played a.
wonderful g‘ame,~and; ended his college
football career in at glorious fashion.
His long run aidedhis team consider-
ably in beating the Panthers for the
first time since Higgins entered the
Mt. Nittany school. . -

 

Pitt will long remember the wonder-
ful ‘work of Capt, Jimmy DeHart and
Jim Morrow, who have played their
last game for the school- There never
was another Jimmy DeHart, and the
gameness of Morrow will always’ be a
marn for otherathletes to aim at.

 

They were too good, boys: too good.
State played like the unbeatable Pitt
team of 1916-17-13. Give them credit.

 

The action of the faculty in throw-
ing Capt. JiLmmy.«*DeHart and old, re-
liable Jim Morrow arous’-‘ed no end of
comment amongthe followers of the
gridiron sport. ' Some, sporting ‘editors
gave the faculty the razz for it, while
more of them commended the action.,
Quite a ‘few people, not connected with
the school, had the idea that Pitt was
a place where the athletes could do
as they pleased. This’ latest develop-
ment should dispel that idea for all
time, V‘ ..  . » _

The Blue and Gold line was re-.

in the season. We still claim that to
be a. good-simile. They bent far and
often, but they never broke. That is,
they never went upin the -air. The

Students of the University of Pitts-

the great international convention of
college and university students, to be
,held at Des Moines, Iowa, during the
week December 31. 1919-January 5,
,1L9__20. There will be ‘representatives,
both men and women, from all over the
.World, and our own University will
send 40 delegates. Qne-third of the
representatives must be from the Stu-
dent Volunteers, and the remainder.
from the student body at large. The
purpose-‘of the great assembly is_to
arouse student interest in religious ac-
tivity, and the first meeting is to be
held here in our own country, whence
.the.} need of re-awakening. interest is
just‘ as great as, if not greater, than
anywhere else. A committee from the
student body will choose. the delegates
to this convention.

 

 

. Jim was really brogght out in the
Syracuse game of 1916, when the
Panthers trounced the ] Orange 30-0.-:—
His ability to _hit the-big} Orange line
was a‘ feature or the year, and from

{that time on he took his place ‘among-

the other great football men the Uni-
versity has turned out. One of his
mainstays is his ability to always. play
la strong defensive game, a factor that
has made him such an’ asset to the
team this year. i — . 
It is unfortunate that Jim has been
hampered by injuries throughout al-
most the. entire.sea.s‘on. Had he been
in the best of physical condition -his
“work would have again been one of
the big features of the year. In spite
7/of these disadvantages he has played
consistent ball whenever he was on
the ﬁeld, "and only left the game. be-
cause of his uncertain physical condi-
tion. ' ‘ . —
