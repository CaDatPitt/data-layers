Accused Killer Continually Harassed Tower 3   Residents

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staffiwriter J

The accused killer of Pitt‘

freshman Monica Renee Jones not
only violated University rules by
sharing his girlfriend’s Tower B
room for almost two months last
year, but continually harrassed the
residents of the ﬂoor, according to
several of those residents. L

It was not until the third week of
January that Sidnev Brinkley
ceased to occupy the eighth floor
room along_ with his girlfriend
Estelle.Hill. That action came only
after an ultimatum was issued by
the resident assistant assigned to
the floor to either move out "or have

a formal complaint ﬁled with the
University.  .
Prior to that Brinkley remained

/on the ﬂoor despite the University

housing regulation stating that no

guest may remainiin a residence '

hall’s room for more than ﬁve
successive days." 0, -
~ He was warned about the rule,”
one of the residents said. “But he
got around it by staying five days in
the room with Estelle and then

moving into the ninth-.ﬂoor ‘lounge -

for a few days.”;

Accordingto the residents,
Brinkley was tied to a number of-
incidents, ranging from charging
long-distance calls to residents

phones without their knowledge to
obscene verbal hairrassment.
JoAnn Woodson, director of the
Ofﬁceof Residence Life, said she
had no recollection of any reports of
Brinkley being on the ﬂoor. She
said her ofﬁce is legally bound to

' destroy all residence hall disciplin-

ary records at the completion of the
school year.  ,
“The resident assistant said

‘a something about a letter being ﬁled‘

with the" Office of Residence Life,
but we never saw it,” the resident.

said. “_We told her over and over, -

and she (the resident assistant
always said ‘well, we’ll_ talk to
him.) 1)

Two. emergency funding re-
quests for WPGH, the student-
operated radio station, were
unanimously approved last night

by the Student Government Board. - T

SGB Allocations Committee
member Bill Abrams brought both
requests to SGB saying “the
allocations committee felt they
were reasonable and should be
considered.

5» The ﬁrstl was $250 to -run a

broadcast line to Forbes Pavillion
from the station's third ﬂoor
student union ofﬁces. Added to
this was a.$70 installation _charge

and a $20 monthly r'nainten'ance'

fee to. keep the line operating... .

Orginally two transformers had

been necessary to broadcast to’

quadrangle rooms but now only one
is needed, Abrams said.

He added \allocations favored‘

funding because . “they (WPGH)
are probably losing money letting a

, transformer lay idle. It’s not right

to deny them the opportunity.” -

‘ Board member Tom Kunkel also
added that on a “philosophical
level, if WPGH can’t operate as an
open air station, it’s only fair that
they be heard on campus.”_

The second funding request was

for‘ $68-a-month ($544 for the

‘school ,-year):~5for chief engineer.-

 , Board Grants wPGH$.1,o 24 In

This position had been previously
funded by the remunerations board
but was dropped from this year’s
list.

Abrams noted that the engineer
presently worked 30-40 hours a
week and would not continue to do
so without pay. He also noted that
to hire a professional engineer from
outside of the university would cost
much more. The total of both
requests was $1024.

It was also reported by Abrams
that the Allocation Committee is in
the, process of reviewing the
recognition‘ status for student
organizations. Each organization
will be assigned a liason fromthe

The resident assistant who‘ is
presently assigned to another

Towers ﬂoor, refused,to comment I

on either the murder or her method
of dealingiwith Brinkley.

“One of the girls went to ORL in
Janaury, but that -was after three
months, and it wasn’t too long after
that Sydney left,” the resident
said.

“She (the ‘resident assistant)

knew we didn’t like him, and there ‘

were enough people who com-
plained about him. I guess she just
didn’t realize how serious it was.”

The resident estimated at least
one-quarter of the ﬂoor was
dissatisﬁed with Brinkley’s actions.

“Everyone keeps asking us why
there weren’t more of us who went

to the Ofﬁceof ResidentLife, but »

they keep forgetting that when this
all happened we were all only
ﬁrst-term freshman,” the resident
said. “We didn’t know then what
channels to go through to”com-
plain. We thought that just by
telling our RA the problem could be
solved-.”i~ 1 - —- ‘

 Ex-Intelligence Agent Says LSDH Used On C

By BOB WARMKESSEL
\ Pitt News Staff Writer
"College students, prostitutes and
unknowing individuals were among
«those people given doses of LSD by

the CIA to determine the hallucin-'

ogen’s possible use in mind
control, said John D. Marks, a
former offical in the U.S. State
Department's Bureau" of Intel-
ligence and Research.

Marks, now an investigative
journalist and a professor at
Harvard University, elaborated on
these and other CIA experiments at
apublic lecture held last night in
the Kurtzman Room of the Student
Union. .

According to Marks, the CIA had
a near-monopoly on the United
States supply ‘of LSD shortly after

the drug was invented in the 1940s.
At first, the intelligence agency
experiemented with the drug by
paying students from the Boston
area $20 to see what effects the
drug would have on them.

However, Marks said, the CIA
began conducting more experi-
ments with LSD that were far more
complex.

Prostitutes and other underworld
ﬁgures soon became the “guinea
pigs” for many of the CIA’s
experiments with LSD because,
said Marks, the CIA thought “that
if any humans should have to be
abused, ' it should be them
(prostitutes, johns, etc.),”

The intelligence agency would
plant LSD in drinks that prostitutes

A» and their johns would consume

during an evening together. Then,
said'Marks, the CIA woqld look
through two-way mirrors to ob-
serve the participants’ reaction to
the ‘drug. '

The CIA.also used drug addicts
at a Lexington,- Ky., drug abuse
center as “guinea pigs,” ‘said
'Marks. He said that drug addicts
who agreed to take LSD were paid
in heroin or in other narcotics.

At Pleast one death has been
attributed to the CIA’ s‘ experiments

 

with LSD. Marks told the story of a A

 

family man who disappeared from
hom and was eventaully found
dead. His wife was told that,he
committed suicide, but it was
learned, 20 years later, that the
man had unknowingly been slipped
the drug and had died from the its
effects. K

Marks said that the CIA’s main
reason for experimenting with
LSD—to try to find ways to control
people's minds—never could be
put into practice, because mind
control of an individual did‘ not

' occur 100 percent of the time. The

drug had different effects on
different individuals.

In fact, according to Marks, the
CIA’s involvement with LSD
experimentation created an un-
expected phenomenon. Many
individuals who had been given
LSD experimentally like their
experiences with it, and they
introduced the drug to their
friends. As a result, Marks said,
LSD gained widespread use on
college campuses in the 1960s.

‘Marks’s ﬁndings on the agency’s
LSDPrexperiments and tests with
about 150 other di'ugs—“there was
nothing that they’ didn’t try—” is
recounted in Marks’s book, “In
Search of the Manchurian Cand-
idate,” which was released in
February.

Freshmen Orientation- 
M<>Ves*To.. AU9U$t     

iv."

By BOB WARMKESSEL‘
Pitt News Staff Writer
Future freshman orientation
programs will take place in late
August rather than in June

' beginning in "1980, according to

Robert ' Firth, ‘ director of new
student programs. 1 _ ' .
“In planning orientation for
August, -we hope to provide‘
freshmen -with more continuity
between orientation and the ﬁrst
weeks of school',”'said Firth.
Declining .attendance at June
orientation is one of the main

reasons for making the" switch,

Firth said. ,-

Only 1,800 out of 3,000 freshman
and transfer students came to the
most recent orientation, held from
June 23-26. Firth 'said_ that
although the early summer gas
crunch influenced attendance
somewhat, the large number of
no-shows indicated that a change in
dates might be beneficial.

The results of a survey that
freshmen took during orientation’
also lead Firth to believe that an

August orientation program would 6

be more convenient for incoming
freshmen. One-third of the
students attending orientation
liked having the activities in June,
but about one-third would have
preferred them in August, just
before .fall classes started. The
remaining one-third of the sur-
veyed respondents had no pre-
ference.  ' _ '

“This survey‘ does not clearly-

K.

- when I got here, I already knew

show that Augtist orientation were

favored by the freshmen, because

the 1,200 students who did not’
attend in June aren't included in
the poll. ‘H
1,200 students did not attend in
June would seem to show that «J une '_

people,’ ’ Firth said.

Pitt has held orientation in June " i '

for eight years. Originally the idea

for a June ‘orientation was initiated’.
, as a “clean break” between high

school and college for incoming
,stu_dents, A
Although planning for next
year’s orientation is in the
preliminary stages, Firth indicates
that orientation will still include
many of the events held; last

summer, including mentor meet-‘i_

ings, and manyacademic and "
social functions. '
Students on campus had a
variety of opinions. on whether it
was _a good idea to hold future
orientation in late August. ‘
0 Senior Cathy Farnan said, “At
C—MU (Carnegie-Mellon Univer-

sity) theﬁrst two days of school are .

just for freshmen. I think that idea;
would work here, too.”

However, freshman Cindy Key-
ser prefers keeping orientation in_'
June. ' _

“Since orientation was in June, .1
had the whole summer to planfor

Carter

Since Madlyn Murray O’Hair stridently fears and
fights insidious plots by religious ‘figures to affect
politics in the United States, perhaps she should in-
vestigate the Oval Office. She is worrying about
Pope John Paul II’s trip to the Unied States (O’Hair
is filing suit to stop the pope from saying a “stupid,
archaic” mass on public grounds) and is claiming it is
an attempt to enhance the intended presidential cand-
_idacy of Senator Edward Kennedy and win support
for an anti-abortion constitutional amendment. But

seeking to‘ make every American ’a— born-again

Gene Waltz, Display Ad Coordinator ~

The only wonder is that O’Hair, who is usually
astute at finding efforts by government to push
religion, has overlooked the blatent attempts of the
president to make us all religious. In his campaign
for the presidency and during the first three years in
office, Carter has made no attempts to hide his
religious beliefs, and has even admitted to the awful
unsecular horrors of talking withGod and praying.
When the president chides the American people for
being morally weak, ,his intent is quite clear:
He wishes to use his government position to make
every American join the Plains Baptist church.‘

Instead of condemning the pope as a “vicious and
unprincipled man” and suggesting the United
Nations‘ try him for crimes against women, O’Hair

ought to start at home and stop Carter’s shameful .

use of his office to push religion on others. Certainly
the president has-a much better chance than the pope
to break down the traditional separation of church

and state, and turn the United States into a
theocracy. As President, Carter can receive air time
on radio and television any time he wants, and his
constant reference to his religion (“Good night, and
God bless you.”) in'his speeches present a clear

threat‘ to the non-religious in the country.

While O’Hair is worrying about papist plots to win
support for Kennedy and the anti-abortion amend-

ment, she should also look to Carter’s public ut-
terances, which must be engineered by the hierarchy

of his church. O’Hair and the American Atheist
Center could act immediately to save the Unite ._}
States by seeking an injunction against Carter for-‘“
bidding him to mention’ his religious preferences.

If O’Hair doesn’t act to stop Carter the nation is
doomed. God is obviously on the president’s side.
His miraculous escape from the clutches of a

possessed rabbit can only be attributed to divine in- ‘

tervention. .

ers to the University of Pittsburgh.
Located in the Three Mile Island
state. north of Appalachia. and east
"of the vacant J&L steel mill of
Youngstown.’ Ohio; Pitt cultivates
its own lack of regard for our
health. '

One case those concerned with
health need to note is the delay in
closing the asbestos-polluted gym
areas of Trees Hall. The Pitt News
of June 26. 1979 reported that
while the facts that asbestos was

used in the construction of Trees
. Hall was known for months. while

Pitt had received EPA guidelines
which dealt in depth with the
dangers of asbestos in March.-and
while as early as June 26'. 1978 the
N.Y. Times had printed a HEW

warning" that nearly half of the ll 1

million U.S. people who had

worked with asbestos over the past »

,40 years may die of cancer.

secondary to the dictates of
administrative scheduling.

This callous disregard of the
health and safety of students.
workers. and the masses is in
general. nationally and internation-
ally. a hallmark of capitalism.

A hallmark of resistance is the
unity of the people against their
common adversary in the form of
unions. The organizing of both a
student union and a staff union at
Pitt would improve the environ-
mental conditions of the people in
Oakland. - i

Fuzzyweeks:
A Look At
Its Origins

By PATTY TASCARELLA

The typical college student is
a well-researched item. Statis-
ttics can pinpoint his character
“via volumes of data on age,
sex, background, religion and
probably more categories than

', anyone cares to have surveyed.
"However, Pitt juniors and
seniors will likely recall when
the typical student could be
found in the pages of The Pitt
News in the persona of two
cartoon strip _characters, form-
ally named Malthus Robinson

‘and Arnold Spanner, but
collectively called “Fuzzy-
Weeks.”

‘Malthus was Fuzzy, and
Arnold, naturally, was Weeks.
They were
cartoon Everyman of campus
life from January 1975 through

, June 1978.

The strip was the creation of
artist Matthew Kambic and
Matthew Kennedy. K/ennedy
waseditor-in-chief of The Pitt
News in 1975 and has since
become a staffer’ at The
Pittsburgh Press. The strip
survived Kennedy's graduation
in 1977 because Kambic
remained as production man-
ager at The Pitt News. When
he left last summer, he decided
to discontinue “FuzzyWeeks."

But due to student demand.
Kambic has donated several of
his favorite strips for reprint,
and Kennedy discussed. the-
origins of development of
“FuzzyWeeks."

“I think the names were
Matt's idea." said Kennedy.
“They're the nicknames of a
couple of kids who went to high
school with us. No other
similarities there other than the
names, though."

Kennedy and Kambic more
or less split the writing end of
:‘ ‘Fuzzyweeks. ’ '

“We'd just sit around and
talk about the two characters
and what they could have been
up to." Kennedy recalled. “A
lot of the situations balanced
around what the characters
were ‘like. The situations
weren't that unusual. They
were the sort of things that
could happen to any student at
a large university."

The strip eventually ex-
panded to include the misad-
ventures of hapless Dean
Bowman. whose secretary Deli-

t lah was not-so-secretly runiting
the college. and a demented
biology professor. whose dis-
sections bordered on latent
bloodlust.

“Lampooning faculty politics
was sort of a natural develop-
ment," Kennedy said. “Event-
ually. students realize that
professors are struggling. too.
There were a lot of references
to the shrill madness of the
tenure strain. The important
thing here is that no one should
have taken it seriously.

"I think. generally speaking.
in a crunch we'd do scripts——10
or 12 strips at a time." he said.
“Sometimes. 1 would write. in
essence. the balloons. It was a

fun thing to do. lt provided a
vehicle for dealing with a lot of
the things in student life that
don't merit an editorial or
hysterical references to the
history of man." '

if " By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

For’ those Pitt fans who felt
Saturday’_s 24-0 walloping of
Kansas wasn't a good barometer to
measure the quality of the
Panthers, listen to what head coach
Jackie Sherrill had to say yesterday
afternoon: . I’

“Kansas is not a bad football -

team," Sherrill told the assembled
_ _ ‘media. “They will win ﬁve or more
’ p g games this year.” ~

But what Kansas does the rest of _

 . ‘the season is not important to Pitt,
and the assignment for the
Panthers this week promises to be
much tougher than the Jayhawks.
The Tar Heels of North Carolina
are coming off an impressive 28-0
win over South Carolina, and the

T heat and humidity of UNC’s Kenan

 _ Stadium‘ can be a nasty factor,

although Sherrill isn't as concerned
as some of the writers.

“It will be hot down there,” he

. said, “but I think out players will

enjoy the heat.” '

The Tar.Heels, like the Panthers,
run fr m the I-for_mation, and their
top runner is Famous Amos;
Lawrence, a junior who has rushedl
for 2,254 career yards. He broke
Tony Dorsett’s record for rushing

yardage by a freshman in one game
with (with 268), and’ is generally

‘ considered one of the three or four

best runners in the countfy.

Lawrence is part of a Carolina
backﬁeld that is both talented and
experienced. Quarterback Matt
Kupec is in his fourtlr year as a

 

By ANNA ARLOTTA
, Pitt News Staff Writer -
When Pitt spectators look out o

the soccer ﬁeld this year, they will

a‘ see a young man in the midfield

wearing number 17. He is small in

_ ‘ stature (about 5-10, no more than

  150 pounds) and hustles for 90
' minutes.

 '.The. playet is sophomore Al

 5 Adelmann. Anyone watching just

 ' ‘ ﬁve minutes of a Panther game can

‘_ -easilv see Adelmann makes up in

 desire what he lacks ’ in size.

  

Quickness, control, and constant

p  hustle are the keys to Adelmann’s
 a» _success.
a  When he first came to -Pitt,
‘L Adelmann realized he would have
_ to work his way into a lineup ﬁlled
‘« with veterans. The midﬁeld
section, where Adelmann had
“ played all his sixyears of soccer,
was not a weak area for Pitt.
. “When Ifirst came to Pitt, I had
 to adjust to the fact that I was a
. first-year player coming into a field
of veterans,” said Adelmann. “I
had to do away with those
freshman butterﬂies in order to
play." .
Adelmann showed Coach Le
 Bemis and the entire ‘Panther team
1 that he was good at chasing those
butterﬂies away. In fact, Adel-
mann soon developed ‘into an
athlete his teammates could trust
with a great deal of responsibility.
" After playing soccer at Notre
_ Dame High School in East
* 1 _ Stroudsburg, Pa., where he was
All-League for three years and his
team’s MVP for two, Adelmann
decided to continue his soccer
career here. Pitt represented a
a’ larger school with better competi-

tion than others he had been"

interested in. It also offered him a
good . mechanical engineering
' school. , ' ’

starter, and fullback Doug Paschal
is the man UNC relies _on for the
' tough yardage inside. ’

The Tar Heels don't run out of
any fancy formations, and their
game plan is a simple and basic
one.

‘‘If we shut off their running
game, then we have a chance to
win,” Sherrill explained. “They go
into the game with the idea they're
going to run the ball, and that’S
what they do.”

Across the ﬁeld from Sherrill
Saturday will be Dick Crum, a man
who had some very successful
seasons at Miami (Ohio) before
going to Carolina last year. The
Tar Heels, a disappointing 5-6 in
1978, are considered a legitimate
threat in the race for the Atlantic
Coast Conference title.

Crum was impressed with. the
panthers’ opening-game" win, and
offered his thoughts as to how "it
was accomplished. ’

f‘Their passing game was
probably the main thing responsi-
ble for their win Saturday,” Crum
said. “And I like both their
defensive ends. Hugh Green, of
course, is an All-American, but the
guy on the ot er side, Jackson, is a
pretty good e also.” ‘

Pitt will be meeting a health.

team Saturday, onelwhich gave Pitt

much trouble before succumbing, .

20-16, last season at Pitt Stadium.
With the Panthers now ranked
13th by both the AP and UPI, every
game has added importance, but as

* Sherrill pointed out, “Our season

Last season Adelmann believes
he learned _a ‘lot about being a
midfielder from the twoplayers
that he shared that line with,
Johnny O'Hara and Karl Nigh.
Both became professionals before

their eligibility at Pitt ran out.
“They were able to help me
improve my game last year by
playing with them,” Adelmann

doesn't depend on the outcome of
this game, so" it wouldn't‘break
us—-but it does have a chance to
help us."

Sherrill’s assessment of the Tar
Heels was concise.

“They’re a very good offensive_
team that makes few mistakes.
Ver-y efficient. Defensively, they
can runand chase the football.”

For the Panthers, wide receivers
Keith Williams and Cliff Moore
are doubtful, but judging from the
performance Saturday of Ralph
Still, Pitt appears well stocked at
that position.

“I'm ‘out to prove that the,
receivers at Pitt are pretty good
this year,” Still said. ,.

Still’s partner in pass catching,
tight end Benjie Pryor, was
understandably pleased with his.
game last week, and issued 'a
statement that sums up the outlook
for the entire'Pitt team.

“I just hope, from now on,”
Pryor said, ‘-‘that the comments
won't be ‘Can I’, but ‘When 1'» 'do
something on the ﬁeld.” . A ,

PITT BITS__——Coaches' AWKl"dS
for: the Kansas game were:
Offensive Player of Game, Ralph
Still;- Co-‘Defensive Players of
’Game, Greg Meisner and Carlton

’ Williamson; Outstanding Offensive '

Lineman, Mark May; Outstanding
Offensive Back, Randy McMillan...
Sherrill said he was displeased with
the performance of the kicking
game ASaturday...The only other
time Pitt played North Carolina at
Chapel Hill was in 1974.

Soccer Team's Al the ‘Mann’ for

said; “.‘I‘o me, it was a
disappointment when they left the
team.” "
. After the departure of O'Hara
and Nigh, Bemis had to build new
midﬁeld sectionaround Adelmann.
Pitt's two games this year.show the
choice of Adelmann a good one.
But Adelmann isn't totally’

satisﬁed with his play.

Stickyweather  

Despite a 35.2 team punting percentage Saturday, coachdackle Sherrill was

not totally pleased with the kicking game.

“Last season was an inconsistent
one for the team, and I was no
exception,” said Adelmann, “We
played well in games against itough
teams like Penn State (Pitt beat the

' nationally ranked Nittany Lions
2-0) and then we played poorly
against teams like Grove City (a
Panther loss, 3-1). On the whole

with my play because I felt that I
was able to learn so much and ‘gain
a lot of collegiate experience.”

Now the 1979 soccer. season is ,

two games old, and the. Panthers
have lost both, 1-0. The season
that ‘Adelmann had been working
sohard for all summer has not been
going well.‘ Adelmann thinks the
key ‘is organization.

“What I think we lack is team
organization on the field.” said
Adelmann. ‘‘I hope that it's just
that we have a lot of new members
on the team that haven't had the
time to get used to playing
together. It's only a matter of time
u_ntil we can get a style together
and coordinate the team to produce
some wins. 4

“We have seen two goalkeepers
in our first two games in an effort to
see who is the right man for the
job. This hasn't proved to be a
problem‘ yet. Out job‘"is to get the
ﬁeld players organized enough so
that we can sfee who will be the best
goalkeeper or our style of piay.
Unce we do get one, he's going to’
have to stay -there so that we can
have players out there together as
a team.” «. ‘ 4

Although winless, * the Panthers
can still turn it around. A
successful second-year isn't the
only thing Adelmann wants for
himself and his teammates.

“I think that we have the skill
that is needed to win, and we

/ certainly have the potential and

desire to have a good season. My
goal for this year is to be ranked.-in
the East. We know we have a good
soccer team out there. .Our next
step is to show everyone else that

ByMARIASCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor
And now, for the university that
has everything from a major
collegiate football winner to a
frisbee club, Pitt re-introduces its

7 Auto Racing Team.

The organization has existed for
nearly a decade, going back to
1971, when Pitt acheived notoriety
by becoming the first college in’ the
country to have its own auto racing

club. In its second year, the team's.

renovated Javelin won the Sports
Car Club of America (SCCA)
Northeastern United States champ-
ionship, plus the 1972 Driver of the
Year ‘Award. A '
After a few years, however, the
team opted for autocross and rallies
instead of roadracing. The races
were tough and the .- car had
become‘, according to driver Bob
Fryer, ‘,‘non-competitive.” H
“We decided to get the team and

car renovated after a two-year

"period ofnot really going out and
racing,” said Fryer. “Plus, the

, rules governing the SCCA had

changed favorable for smaller cars
and so by lightening the car by four
or ﬁve hundred pounds, wenadded
75. horsepower. ’ ’ A , ,
But now the team is. the

proud owner of a Gulf-sponsored .
This car was purchased’

Javelin. ’
for a bargain $9000 by the club with
its own funds from Roger Penske,

 the car’s designer; The Javelin is a

duplicate of the car Mark Donahue

, won with in the 1971 Trans Am and

was in fact driven by Donahue.
Added to the car’s improvements

were larger, wider wheels and.a

larger engine. The team is

fortunate in that Gulf 0il’s world

resource center is in Harmarville,

where its engineers have allowed’

the team to use its facilities.

At the July Watkins Glen
Six-Hour, the team's ﬁrst profes-

control of the car and travel
“straight, when the road curved.”
Up until then, Pitt had been fourth

By The Associated Press

NEW Y‘ORK—Reggie Jackson’s
running feud with owner George
Steinbrenner of the New York
Yankees intensiﬁed Tuesday, and

 , Manager Billy Martin reportedly

has insisted that the volatile, $2.9
million superstar be traded.

-i In Cleveland, where the Yankees
played the Indians in a night game,

' Martin acknowledged that he .had
I talked with General Manager

Cedric Tallis about possible trades-
“not just J ackson”—but denied he
had speciﬁcally put the ﬁnger on
Reggie.

ii’ g‘_¢Wedncsday, September 19, 1  

..,,
‘.'.

“I have said that I get tired of
picking up the paper every day and
seeing a headline’ about this player
saying something about that player
or the owner,” Martin said. 5‘

“It’s not the Yankee way. It’s
disruptive. I don’t like it.”

Steinbrenner, meanwhile, held a \

drawn-out meeting in his New York
headquarters with Tallis’. After-
ward. Steinnbrenner said he did
not want to get personally involved
in the latest controversy which
grew out of the Catﬁsh Hunter Day
Sunday at Yankee Stadium. Tallis
was equally close-mouthed.

However, a Yankee source’said
Martin twice ‘had stormed into
Tallis’ office in recent days and
requested that some provision be
made for trading Jackson. Martin
reportedly cited perils to team
morale; 4 , .

Jackson, frequently at odds with
both Martin and Steinbrenner,
relighted old .fires with the
assertion that he was denied the
privilege Sunday of presenting a
special gift to his long-time

"teammate and friend, pitcher

Hunter, who has announced
retirement at the end of the season.

Reggie, a teammate with Hunter
on the Oakland A’s championship
teams in 1972-73-74, said he had
brought to the stadium" a golden
replica of the World Series trophy
with 26 golden banners approp-

‘ riately engraved: “World Champ-

ions 1972-1973-1974-1977-1978. To
Catfish Hunter From Reggie
Jackson.”

“George wouldn’t let me present
it on the ﬁeld,” Jackson told the
New York Daily News. “I don’t
know why. I am not trying to be
different. I am giving it because

Cat and I have been together 10-

[Yenkee Manager Billy Martin Insists, Trade Reggie Jackson  

years..;” ’

Steinbrenner did deny that he
had nixed Reggie’s special act.

“I didn’t know anything about
it,” the owner said. “Last week
Mickey Morabito, Yankee publicity
director, had told me Reggie
wanted to present the players’ gift
to Catﬁsh. I said OK if that’s what
the players want.” .

Morabito confirmed Stein-
brenner’s statement. “There were
so many gifts to be presented and
such little time we had no way to

squeeze it in because of the tight

time schedule,” he said.

the latest trends in fall and winter
fashion. The emphasis was on
color, some of it bright and boldly
matched, and materials. Featured
were ﬂannels, tweeds, silk prints,
and handloomed knits. And, of
course, there were furs. Over two
dozen beautiful coats from various
pelts that every woman in A the
audience craved upon sight.

The newest pelt being used in
the fashion world, by the way, is
coyote. ' _

As for Sachs’ collection, it
is completely natural: handblocked
-printed challis .from ‘England,
authentic ‘tartans, checks and
cashmere from Scotland -and Irish
tweeds. Sachs’ color scheme was
purples‘ and wines contrasted with
black and charcoal grays for
daytime, brilliant purple, gold and
red-for evening. ' »

Pitt’s Golden Girls opened last
night's 15th Annual Pittsburgh
Symphony Fashion Gala, stomping
and twirling as they rose on a
hydrolic lift out of the ochestra pit.
It was a ﬁtting beginning for the
show’s Parade/ Pleasure theme.

The benefit, which is sponsored
by the Women's Association of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Society, in
cooperation with” Home’s, was a
salute to United States designer
Gloria Sachs. It also included
collected _works from dozens of

   

issues
and

was provided by the Pittsburgh-
based band, Risque. A six-
nie_mber band with a sassy
leading lady, Risque performed in
the main lobby, which provided
ample dancing space for the
evening’s sold-out» crowd. The

band performed everything from _

Donna Summer disco to The
Knack, including a healthy
sarﬁpling of its own material.

Within minutes of Risque’s
opening, the dance ﬂoor was ﬁlled
with undoubtedly some of
Pittsburgh’s;best-dressed people.
And the show’s models joined in
too, still wearing originals from the
last set. '

All this, in the ‘lush red,
go1d..and marble atmosphere of

_ ' Heinz Hall made for an extravagant I

and highly successful Gala.’ This
was. the first year, in fact, an
additional afternoon performance
was scheduled because of the
event’s popularity.

WE'RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR LIFE

Most students play by the 111195
when placing a long distance
call. They take advantage of bar'-
gain rates and make their calls

during the discount periods. It
you re not sure when you can call
at discount rates, check your '

phone book.

A few students think it's  to
break the rules by stealingtheir

telephone calls. They're not beat—‘ -

ing the system, they're taking
advantage of all of us, because it
drives up the cost of providing
telephone service.

_ Students who break the rules also
run the risk of paying a large tine.

Spending time in jail. And getting

A lot of big corporations offer you a big
title. But how many offer a young college
graduate a really important job?

As a Navy Officer, you don’t have
to Wait to do a job that counts. We give
you one as soon as you’ve earned your
commission. A job with responsibility for

» the lives of others,  for millions of dollars .
of complex equipment. A job that requires
_ skill and leadership. A job that Navy Officers
‘have been doing proudly for 2.00 years; “

If that’s the-kind of job you’re,looking -‘ '
for, speak to a Navy recruiter. You’ ll ﬁnd
that Navy Officers have unequalled '
opportunities in ﬁelds like Nuclear Power,
Aviation, and Engineering. "

‘Max’ Unhappy With Press Zep Review

Pittsburgh, like every other major city
in the United States, has its share of daily
newspapers and FM radio stations. The
following is a respone to one of the most
ludicrous exchanges ever made between

' one FM disc jockey and on of the daily

papers, concerning the ability of a record
critic who is employed by that paper.

‘ First, however, a little background '

seems in order. On Monday, Sept. 10,‘
WDVE (FM 102.5) disc jockey “Max ”N
voiced a rather strong opposition to a
record review ‘written by the Pittsburgh
Press’ Pete Bishop. The review was a
pan of the new album by veteran rock
group Led Zeppelin. “Max,” last name
unknown,_ was so enraged by Mr.
Bishop’s negative review of the “In
Through the Out Door” album that he
personally slandered Mr. Bishop and
called for an all-out effort to force Mr.
Bishop’s termination as music critic, and

 Praise, And Suggestions From A Reader . .  

analytical and but the cover —

I would like to compliment you on the

quality of your entertainment magazine. ,

I’ve been a>student at Pitt for three years
and your supplement is a vast
improvement over the entertainment
page that the regular Pitt News formerly
used. ' ' ’ ‘

I think your concert and album reviews
are good arid the opinions of the writers
are right on target. The features and
cover stories are consistently interesting.
In particular, I liked the cover story on the
closing of Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater
(Showcase No. 8, September 5). It was

also encouraged a reader boycott. .

To me, “Max’s” behavior is totally
uncalled ‘for. This fellow, too‘ gutless to
reveal his last name, seems to"'have the
narrow-minded opinion that because,Mr.
Bishop calls ’em» the way he sees ’em he
is doing a poor job and should be
removed. “Max.” (Mr. Max?) should
take a valuable lesson from Mr.’ Bishop
and start standing up for whatever values
he may or may‘ not have and admit that he

doesn’t like an album (or song) instead of '

notbothering to play it. (WDVE_ is
notorious for playing only a few select
albums over and over again).

Believe it or not, Max, there are some
members of your audience who don’t

' much care what you have to say about '

anything, but are unfortunately made to
suffer such indignations as your personal

vendettas in order to gain access to ‘

otherwise unavailable music. Needless to

photo itself ws blurry. ' The theater
reviews are excellent, thanks to Mark
Holan. ' p " ’
There are a" few’ complaints‘ to be
registered. The lack of book reviews is an
outstanding example. Many ‘people read

books from the Best Seller list and are A
interested in ﬁnding out about them

before buying them. I think you should
devote.more space to these books. Also,
although I’d like to see more movie
reviews printed, ’I’m generally dissatis-
fied with the seeming lack of understand-

say, without the Midnight album your
station would be just another of, those
middle-of-the-road radio stations which
cater not to the tastes of the listeners but

(to the megabuck interests of the record

companies eager to cash in on your ability
to inﬂuence the record-buying habits of
your audience. No one with any sense
ever said that good sales are the absolute
criteriakfori “good” albums. Hopefully
this criteria will never be universally
accepted. —— ‘

All in all, “Max,” keep your ears open
and your mouth closed. (Unfortunately,

Mr. Bishop is not alone in his opinion of i

this album. The Pitt New’s SHOWCASE
review was equally’ unfavorable.)

Signed,
Jeffrey Barent

The Pittsburgh Dance Alloy is a young.

and exciting group, and one worth
watching. It is a jewel of a modern dance

company; multi-facetediin make-up and‘

Originally part of the, «University's
“Dance Ensemble, the Alloy decided in
1976 that it had the talent and capabilities“
to become part of the professional scene.
Today, as‘ a result of quality choreo-
graphy, expertise and gutsy determina-
tion, the company has won the hearts of
dance enthusiasts in the city at large, as
well as hefty endowments from local
foundations and the Pennsylvania Council

Frozen in the air are dancers from the Pittsburgh Dance Alloy, from a recent

production.

Susan Gillis, administrative director,

is optimistic about the future. Plans. for
this year include: salaries for the

seven-member team, the hiring of a,

_profes‘sional manager, some touring, and

' the establishment of_a Board of Directors.
“Many dancers are ill-equipped and "

disinterested in the business aspect of the
art. Our new structure will give us the
freedomto concentrate on what we love

The American Music Sceneln The '70s: A Unique View

Editors Note: There are as many
opinions about today’s music as there are
listeners. This week’s cover story is one
opinion, written with a unique angle.
Some readers may agree, others may
disagree.

We invite your opinions, views and
comments, both pro and con, about this
article and today’s music scene as well as
Showcase’s coverage of it.

By DAVID E. STUBBS

America is often referred to as the
melting pot of the world. Nowhere is this
more evident than in ‘the country’s music.
There V has been a lot of literature
concerning the [quality of contemporary
music lately. Through its history,
American music, and the quality thereof,
goes hand in hand with the trends and
attitudes of the times. Classic examples.
ofthis would be the gaity of’music.in the
carefree 20’s and the rambontous and»
crude sounds of the 50’s during the
post-war, pre-baby-boom times.

This connection between the country.

and its music can also be seen today. The
late 70’s has produced an uneasy attitude
that the government is corrupt, you’ll
never have enough money, things aren’t
what they used to be, and perhaps most
of all, the feeling that the individual can’t

makeia difference in our society: Our,

music has taken on a trend of
passiveness. American music, no matter‘
how good or bad, always had some sort of
message for its listeners. Not anymore,

"today are good crossover acts.

its just Love, Hate, “You Left Me,”
Dance, and Boogie songs.

One very important trend of music is
the use of cultural separatism. The
distance and differences between races
shows easily in their music. The
differences between, Blacks and Whites
gets a lot of attention in society and of
course that means in music too. The

' entire music market is broken down by

race. For example: rock, funk, country,’
soul, punk and reggae." The differences
in labels show differences in tastes and
cultures.

Few, if any, people involved in the
music industry will dispute that separa-
tism is a very useful marketing tool.

‘Music promotion has to be one of the
more fascinating sciences of the decade._

It is the science of calculated risk.

The knack of separating and labeling a
given artist or group is a simple process
starting with first, the music‘; second, the
company’s promotion of it, and finally,
the radio stations’ promotion of it.

“At this time a lot of the popular trends
in music‘ are looking for direction. The

present lack of quality is representative of ~—

this search,” said Jack Robertson,
program director at radio station WYDD.

On the otherside of separatismjis the
science of crossover. Crossover is when a
musical act sells in more than one musical
category. _A lot of the more quality acts
Classic
examples of good crossover artistsare
Gino Vanelli, Donna ‘Summer, Earth,
Wind & Fire, Steely Dan,’ and Chic. The

, record companies have a great deal to do

with ‘crossover success. By being popular
in more than one category, the group
leaves the record company many options
concerning its promotion.

Gino Vanelli, for example, can be
promoted on Top 40, rock, jazz, and Black
radio. The possibilities for a top hit are
outstanding. For this reason Robertson
felt that many groups will purposely vary
their appeal by doing one disco._c_ut, one
R8£B cut, one rock cut, etc. ,

Obviously, the record companies have
a lot to do with everything involving
today’s music. All the companies are

somewhat esoteric about their proceed-.

ings, but the general process of how a
group “makes-it” is rather basic.

First the act is discovered and‘ signed.
Then comes a period known as artist
development. Artist development is

where the record company carefully
works on the artists’ talents and styles. It
has been stated by «popular journalists -

that this stage is responsible fortsome of
the mediocrity in late 70’s music.

Take for example new groups such as.

Toto, Splendor, Bighorn or Hotel. All of
these groups are technically proficient

but find themselves in patterns and‘

moods which have been done many times
before. These groups aren’t bad but they

are steered into regions of ~musical-

stagnation.

Robertson disagreed with this point.
He feels that the record companies
merely help the groups get what they
want; commercial success. ’ _

As we venture quickly into the 80’s, we
face the never ending question of what

next? Late 70’s lifestyle has taken uponia V V

renaissance type attitude. Examples of
this would be the return of fundamental
education, straight-legged pants, ties,
and acoustic music. S

Noel Coppage made many good
observations of the 70’s and forecasts for
the 80’s in his article, “Requiem for the
Seventies” in July's issue of Stereo
Review magazine. ’

“A mass music, the late seventies
demonstrate, cannot be -art and willinot-

very long even try to be. Because art is B

an’ elitist activity and “elitist” is a bad
word. This point is dramatically
illustrated in the. systematic, synthetic
music known as disco. Disco is, to say the
least, not artistic, for the most part, and
makes no attempt .to be. But the

75,000,000 people or so who enjoy it could L

care less,” he said.

Coppage’s view of the 80’s is
optimistic. Indeed, things couldn’t get
too much worse. ' - ._

“For over a century, our
numbered decades have generally turned
out to be more dangerous, more lively,
more interesting than our odd-numbered
ones. It’s turkey one day, feathers the
next; ﬂappers one decade, depression the
next,” Coppage philosophizes. '

The. 80’s should be very intense.
Somewhere down the line our many
different kinds of cultures and beliefs
should produce some interesting results.
It is doubtful that‘ races will come any

» closer together, butfmusical separatism
should produce some interesting results. ‘ ’

Triumph’s Rik Emmett Talks About Life A

By GARY TWEED
. /

Triumph is a young group whose last
A two albums, “Rock n’ Roll Machine” and
.“Just A Game" have catapulted them
into the mainstream of American rock.
The band, composed of Ric Emmett, Gil
Moore and Mike Levine, appeared in
Pittsburgh this summer at the Stanley
Theatre and did a show last week at the

Wheeling Civic Center. ,

Lead guitarist Rik Emmett talked. with
Showcase staﬂ’ writer.Gary Tweed after
the Pittsburgh show about Triumph’s
direction. This is the second time in a
year that Emmett and Tweed have talked.
SHOWCASE: last time we talked you

. were hoping for a hit single to break

Triumph in the United States. With
“Just a Game” you have a couple. How
do you view this now that it has
happened?

EMMETT: Well I like it. I'm glad. It's

what I wanted. I hope we can keep the
momentum happening. I like to think
now that we have a base that we can work
from. Last time we talked. Triumph was
not ‘a very recognizable thing to most
people. but I think that now some people
are very aware of it and at least it's on the
edge of some people's consciousness. I

~~ think that's a very good start for us and

now I'm starting to feel a little more
comfortable with the thing, I start to think
now maybe Triumph’s going to be around
another ten years or so. I feel the vibes
that something solid is happening. It
makes .me feel conﬁdent. It makes me
feel secure.

SHOWCASE: Two songs, “Lay It On The

Line" and “Hold On" are getting a lot of '

airplay, at least in Pittsburgh. How is
your second album. “Just A Game"
doing in the United States?

EMMETT: Very, very well. It's on the
charts in all the trades--it's in the top 50.
Sales are very. very good. I don't know
exact ﬁgures but it's getting close to gold.
Things are rolling along nicely and RCA
assures me that everything is just Jim
Dandy. 

SHOWCASE: There seems to be a lot of
difference between “Rock n‘ Roll

Machine" and “Just A Game," your

second album. Musically there are more‘

' melodic tunes on the second, and it seems

Triumph lead guitarist Rik Emmett.

to indicate the group has grown a lot
--more of a spiritual growth.

EMMETT: I think that's a very accurate
description. I think we've grown more
comfortable with each other as players.
We had a long time between “Just A

Game" and “Rock n’ Roll Machine," so I’

think the quality of the writing of the
tunes is a lot stronger. And I think there
is a more marked maturity in material and
performance. Each guy's playing. on the
record and in the production as well. This
time instead of having an outside
producer involved we had Mike (Levine)
do it with the band directly so that made a
difference too. I think the project felt
very. very personal to everybody
involved. I know I felt it.

SHOWCASE: We noticed in songs like
“Hold On" a quality--something like
what Hermann Hesse was trying to get at
--the dreams you have. being faithful to
them, being faithful to yourself. The
lyrics seem to bring to mind “Blinding
Light_ Show" _.off “Rock n' Roll
Machine"--that type of personal state-

I

ment. "Art .is that--very personal and

4 dealing with your spiritual growth as a

person. I.

EMMETT: That’s true. I think that
aspect has to be in all the things that we
do, not just;the lyrics that we write, but
the parts that we play and the way the
songs end up sounding. It all has to have
that feeletmit.

SHOWCASE: How— do you view music as
an art form? .

EMMETT: There's a lot of compromises
to make. First of_all, music is an art form
and I am an artist. Second of all, it is the
way that I earn my living. I am a
performer and entertainer and there are
certain’ compromises I inevitably" have to
make because of that.

I enjoy the aspect of being able to get
up in front of people and give them
something substantial. In the new show,
for example, I play7';‘Fantasy Serenade"
live and in front _of a large, big-rock
crowd. Sometimes aclassical guitar solo
is not a thing they want to hear. But if I

give the people enough of the music that"

they came to hear, music that they like,
that they can feel energy-exchange with,
then I think they are going to be more
willing to accept the kind of artistic
statements that I like to make because
I've built up a certainrapport.

Everybody likes to imagine themselves
as being the person that's on stage. Of a
100% of our audience, say 60% of them
like to visualize themselves as being the
guitar player in the band, or the bass
player, or the singer, or whatever. They
like to feel the fantasy-type of rapport. So
if I don't open myself up as an artist, as a
musician, then there's never going to be
that easy ability for the people to relate.

As I said before, the compromises that
I have to make as an entertainer don't
bother ine in the slightest because they
help to build that rapport that's so
important to me. And then, when I
actually do self-indulge a little bit on a
musical level, or whatever, I think it
carries much more conviction, and has
much more substance to it for the people
that hear it.

SHOWCASE: It's like
interchange or an interaction between the
audience and performer.

' EMMETT: Exactly!

building an

nd Lyrics

SHOWCASE: It allows you the freedom
to create. .

EMMETT: ‘That's very true and, you
know, Ithink that’s one thing that a lot of
critics overlook. There is a very special
thing that happens at a rock show that
doesn't happen in a theatre experience,
at a play, or movie. It has its own unique
thing and a lot of that is in the way that
the audience relates to the artist.
SHOWCASE: The concert in Pittsburgh
was full of hassles. First we had to get
the camera okayed--then the ushers
kicked you out of the aisles when you took
pictures. We've never been so hassled in
our lives. , K _
EMMETT: That was a very weird show,
and very,—ver.y strange. , The Babies were
on that one——-right? And that was the one
with theruckus.

SHOWCASE: ' What exactly happened?
EMMETT: I think the write-up in the
paper (The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette) the
next day was fairly accurate. The singer
was trashing our gear on stage—you
know, kicking lights off and stuff, and he
had already been°warr_ied not to do it, and
he continued to do it. You see, Triumph

has‘ always maintained the position “of

headlining their own shows. Occasionally
you get a band like the Babies, who I
suppose resent the fact that they have to
open for a band‘ like Triumph, who
they've probably never heard of before.

That was the attitude going down and
there was not a very professional
approach to the show on the stage crew's
part. They went on late and 'they'were
being abusive to the gear, and the stage
manager of the sound and light company
decided to shut ’em down—because they
were wrecking his equipment. I don't
blame-him. There's this whole thing
about rock bands and opening acts and
headliners; headliners making it difficult
for opening acts to go over well because
they limit the stage size. sound. and
lights and all that kind of stuff. And
we've always tried to be very fair to our
opening acts. We've never tried to stop
them from being able to playtheir music
to the best of their ability. We're not
interested in that kind of political

backstabbing. game-playing.

But then again, I don't think it's
professional for aband to go on ahead of

bit immature.

they had closed the curtain about ﬁve
seconds before the Babies began their
fourth tune. As it was the people
booedeone or two rushed the stage and
started a fight with the stage crew. About
six people were expelled from the theatre,
and’ there was almost a riot.
EMMETT: Amazing! Really. I had not
arrived at the hall till just a few minutes
before that. I was up in the dressing
room and I didn't see any of it occur. But

i , when‘ you're close to something that's

going down—a heavy sort-of-silly thing
like that—you feel the vibes and I knew

_ "that something was just really wrong.

-But, as I said before, I try _to avoid these
things as much as possible. because I
have enough things to worry about.
Anyhow, I hope that kind of thing will
never happen again.

EMME'IT: The silly loon. He jumped off ”

his drum riser and was all in the dark and
couldn't see and he slipped himself over a
light tower and twisted his ankle and fell
on his side and hurt himself in about
three places. His ankle swelled up and
they called the paramedics and they came
in and had a look at it, but it wasn't

for a loop off the drum riser at the end of

Since the latest Crusaders effort,
f‘Streetlife,” was released in late May, it

"has ,_been.subject to all kinds of comments

——mostly negative. , The Crusaders have _
always been a changing band, developing v

the sound that is unmistakenly their own.

For nearlv 30 vears the Crusaders had _

been a popular jazz standard. But inlate

—1976 the Crusaders underwent what

"stands-—to be ' their biggest change.

pianist Joe Sample. “Free As the Wind”
was-the Crusaders’ first platinum album,
out the critics hit it with some very

negative propaganda. ‘-
The Crusaders next album was: the
critically acclaimed album “Images,"' a

down to earth collection of electric fusion t

with sax player»Wilton Felder and ‘pianist
Joe Sample in the spotlight.
“Streetlife” is yet anotherphase in the

‘Crusaders’ legacy. The title_cut features
=’th-6*-great composing, string arranging,
and horn arranging of Joel Sample,

coupled with a special guest appearance
by Miss Randy» Crawford doing a verv

nice vocal interpretation. The rest of_

the album‘ is somewhat predictable, but
the Crusader_’s'have' a special touch with
their melodies. As’ usual," Joe Sample’s
songs are the best on the album.

The Crusaders ‘have’: never J had
problems producin ' quality music.
“Streetlife” is’ no efception. It seems
that the Crusaders’ only problem comes
from critics -and purists. These persons
always try to compare recent works to

what they consider to be" the better days .
"of the past.

Fortunately, music always
progresses past—.the wills of these purists.
Hopefully groups such as the Crusaders
will continue to ignore these people and
continue their own form of evolution.

The Sultans Of Swinig‘Change S’ry|eOn 'Commpunique'

By SCOTT Mownr

Dire Straits
Communique '
Warner Brothers

Early last winter, seemingly out of

nowhere, a strangely unique record, -

“Sultans of Swing,” began to gather
steady radio airplay as well‘ as more than
curious interest among America’s too
predictable music market. Quickly‘,

“Sultans of Swing,”. a‘ ballad paying .

tribute to a forgotten Dixieland band,
v lted to the top ten on the U.S. charts
and shoved Dire Straits, a hitherto
unknown British new wave group into the

_ limelight.

Immediately, ' critics and fans alike
hailed Dire Straits as a most gifted and
fresh band. Next to the reclusive Elvis
Costello, Dire -Straits made perhaps the
most signiﬁcant impact on the U.S_.‘charts
of any new wave imports, as the single
pulled along the album. 2 '

In the meantime, while America was
only beginning to‘ catch onto the Dire
Straits charm, the crucial follow-up
album, “Communique” hadalready been
recorded in Nassau, Bahamas. Released

‘ when ’-the rocketing sales of the debut

album levelled off, “Comminique” points
to a new direction for a band that seems
blessed with unlimited potential. Instead
of repeating a latent success formula,
Dire Straits has taken their music a step
beyond}; . "

“Communique,” although much tamer
_than “Dire _Straits,” still offers some of
the most engaging and innovative rock to
On this second
album Dire Straits proves its virtuoso
with many styles. From jazz to reggae,
from blues to traces of country, folk, ‘funk

and new wave’, the versatility of the
_compositions— demonstrates a keen sense

of musical mastery as well as a
willingness to progress.

Once again, as on the first record, it is,
the precise lead guitar of Mark Knopfler,
probably one of the most exciting in rock
today, that guides the Dire Straits sound
through the eclectic collection of songs on»
“Communique.” Although paced this
time around, Knopfler’s guitar playing
still has ‘that recognizable quality that
sets him part from most axe wizards and
7"'g"'ive.s.' Dire Straits that gorgeously
un-equalled sound._ Bob Dylan certainly
thought so, when he recruited Knopﬂer
for his most recent record, “Slow Train
Coming."

Hardly a one-man band, however, the

remainder of Dire Straits, David Knopﬂer «
V on rhythm guitar, John Illsley on bass and

Pick Withers on drums, make their
talents more apparent, providing equally
consistent accompaniment on the diverse
m’at'erial. I i

' “Communique” the

opens with

I reggae-inﬂuenced “Once Upon a Time in’

the West,” a clear ,reﬂection of the

Carribean environment in which the

album was recorded. “News” is a
country-tinged number propelled by the
steady drumming of Withers, who also
was invited to perform on Dylan's “Slow
Train Coming.” “Where Do You Think
You’re Going?” displays a folkist rhythm,

‘ while the title tuneﬁnds Knopflerl and _ is

co. honing their funk chops.

Side two has a much more coherent and
textured flow. “Lady Writer” promptly
shifts the album’ into a lively up-beat
direction much more akin to the tone of

the first record“ This cut standsrout as the

ghost rocking new wave of a surprisingly
m'ell'ow, laid back set in which Dire Straits
appears relaxed yet conﬁdent in their
approach. “Lady Writer” moves nicely
into “Angel of Mercy," a delicate, jazzy
song, tender in its personal message.
