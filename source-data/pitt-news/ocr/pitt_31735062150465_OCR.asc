proposal to tliiséegfect went to the

City  Pittsburgh last

week, frateifiity spokesmen say.

According to John Hughes, C42,
president of Phi Kappa fraternity,
the proposal for the re-zoning of
Neville street from Center avenue
to Wallingford street would change
that district from a class B to a class
A zone. Class B zones, according to
the present city ordinance,'do not
permit boarding houses, and fra-
ternities are considered boarding
houses. Therefore Phi Kappa and
Sigma Alpha Mu fraternities are
illegal dwelling places.

The re-zoning proposal came from
a real estate agent,‘ says——H—ughes,
and when presented to the City
Council caused quite a debate. As
yet there have been no results.

A class A zone would not only
permit fraternity houses but also
apartment houses, hospitals, mul-
tiple dwellings, and the like, states
Hughes.

Players, the Independents ampli-
ﬁed their pre-election chatter

through the ground ﬂoor elevator
lobby until stopped by orders of
Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men. When driven from the Cathe-

outside Memorial hall to urge the
approaching voters to ballot for
Independent slates.

Fraternity men and women out-
side the hall countered the Inde-
pendent ampliﬁer with an inform-
al song-fest. Whenever the Inde-
pendents began to speak over the
ampliﬁer, the Fraternity supporters
would sing “Hail to Pitt,” “The
Panther,” “Dear Old Tech,” or some
other college favorite. When the
Tech song reached the ears of
the Independent announcer, he
shouted: “Tech voters to your right,

‘l'I‘he third annual Vesper service
of the Lutheran students of the
University, Carnegie Institute of
Technology, and the Pennsylvania

College for Women, will be held at
the Heinz Memorial chapel, Sunday
afternoon at 4:30 o’clock.

“Four Kings” willbe the subject
of an address by Dr. Edward Kuhl—

an church, Oil City, Pa.

Dr. Kuhlmann, author of eight
books, the most recent of which are,
“Watch Yourself Go By,” and
“Cross Examined,” is an outstand-
ing leader of the American Luther-
an church, and is at present chair-
man of the Board of Education.

Also taking part in the service
will be the Rev. G. B. Tejan, and
the Rev. Elmer P. Wentz, both of
whom are active in the student

Double-voting, once a. problem
in SFA elections, was nearly nil
this year. One wiseacire cracked:
“The watching system is so good
that now only the watchers vote
more than once.”

One fraternity man, who shall go
nameless in this accounting, was
embarrassed by having someone
found using his identiﬁcation card
of last year in trying to vote. He
explained that the fellow hadn't
brought his card for this year and
so he was generous and lent one to
him.

Gusts of wind were doing their

Tapped to Delta Sigma Rho, hon-
orary debating fraternity were two
junior men and two senior women;
William Seyler, C, Harold Bycr, C,
Eliabeth Krowich, C, and Harriet

one of the candidates added to the
lists by the Independents at the
meeting of the SFA executive com-

Schaughency ran on the Pilam, Phi

A great deal of confusion at the
polls was caused by the require-
ment of the election board that
identiﬁcation cards stamped for
second semester were needed be-
fore a student could vote. The
registrars ofﬁce was designated as
the place where students without
cards could present pictures and
have them placed on new identiﬁca-
tion cards. A rush to the office
early this morning and the suspi-
cion that men were obtaining more
than one card in this manner caused
suspension of this service. Many
students lost the right to vote
through this decision.

race to the fact that all but one
of the women‘s fraternities voted
along with them. Delta Leta was
the only woman’s fraternity which
did not vote along with the other
fraternities.

Hiram Milton, Independent sen-

Tait placed tenth. six votes above

Fraternity strategy has always
included crowding the polls at 12:30
o'clock when a majority of the stu-
dents plan to vote. They followed
this custom again this year and the
polls were crowded to capacity at
lunch. Fraternity men were said
to be under instruction to linger in
the voting booths so that the long
voting lines would discourage pros-

On the Place of Public
Speaking on Campus

IT IS SELDOM that one has the opportunity
to employ. -_the written word in praise of the
spoken. This is. what we should like to do at
this time. _

Within thepast few weeks we have had a
flurry ofsymposiums, speaking unit meetings,
poetry-speaking contests, and town meetings.

University debaters -came back from Ohio
with nine victories in ten events-

A Univer'sity‘”student was awarded the ﬁrst
prize at the ‘recent Peace Oratorical contest at
Buckiiell. Next year’s contest has been awarded
to the Pitt campus.

This is a healthy indication. A large amount
of praise must be given to the men and women
of the University,-and to the members of the
speech department, who made these things pos-
sible. - '

‘It should be kept in mind that debating and
public speaking are just as vital activities on a
large campus as are football and basketball. Yet
the attention given by the spectator-mass of
students leans far more heavily towards the
athletic side of school activities.

The six speeches presented by the ﬁnalists in
Wednesday’s contest were as competent, as pol-
ished, and as interestingly presented as any we
have heard given by a similar group. Yet only
a handful of students attended.

We feel that a lot of sincere effort is being
expended‘ and that the returns, from the view-
point of the student body at large, are exceed-
ingly small. « ;

It seems again that brawn has triumphed
over brain.

Kappa Sigma Obit:
Things to Come?

WE FIND IT difficult to write an obituary
on the folding of the Kappa Sigmas on campus.
We ﬁnd it so because, sad that the local story
is, it brings with it forewarnings of many un-
pleasant things to come, not only at Pitt, but
also on every collegiate campus in the country.

There was nothing exceptionally wrong with
this year’s crop of Kappa Sigs. They were just
unfortunate to be t-he actives this year, at a time
when the debts of Kappa Sigs for the past ten
 piled up to the extent that the national
chapterncould no longer tide them over.

'Admit1,ed‘by frat-ci-i'nity leaders is the fact
that the financial status of most of the houses
at Pitt is none too good. Admitted also is the
prediction that the collapse of the Kappa Sigs
is but the ﬁrst of a series of “reorganizations”
destined. to take place on campus in the near
future. , I ,

Mainreajson for this gloomy prospect is the
uncertainty in the minds of most college men
today. Those who haven’t already been regis-
tered for ‘selective service are not making many
plans for the future because of the shadow" of
this 'summer’s R—Day.

,And those collegians who are not of draft
a e are watching day-by-day developments of
the Americ_anLegion‘lobby to change the limits
to pover ‘all, eighteen-to-twenty—one-year-olders.

All of ‘which "does not ‘make for the most
ideal fraternity conditions.

"Serious as the situation may be at Pitt, how- ’

ever, it is likely to wreak worse havoc on small
campuses. Reports from Dickinson college, for
example, reveal that in one fraternity thirteen
juniors and seniors may soon have to trade their
jewelled pins for buck private uniforms.

It is to be regretted that the Kappa Sigs
should have fallen under a set-up which is affect-
ing all fraternities. We hope that the others
will be able to readjust themselves in time to
avoid a recurrence of the same situation.

There comes a time (sometimes it comes more than
once) in every mature person‘s life when he or she
faces a dull, grey, hard, high wall. Perhaps it is sur-
mountable. Perhaps not. There are several ways to
reach the other side. They are indirect methods .
walking around the wall being carried to the
other side . . employing a ladder . . even air-
planing over.

There are those of us who do not want to get to
the other side. We stop and examine the wall and
contemplate the rewards for surmounting the wall.
Then we turn away. Often we point straight for
other walls——taller, greyer. Sometimes we merely
turn away from all walls, and fold up, like Pagliacci’s
dusty, little accordion.

A few persons—ei-iceedingly few—knock the wall
down and move ahead. These are the men and women
who have good minds, open minds; stout hearts, un-
derstanding hearts. These are the exclusive, the ex-
alted.

But what's the difference. What the hell do we--
the ones who stop-—care. We have ice cubes, toeless
shoes, movies, sliced bread, two-tone“aut.os, regulated
toasters, insurance..summer resorts, and bargain sales.
Yeh, what do we care. Let them break that miner‘s
skull. Let them lock up that psychopathic case. Let
them bulldoze that little shopkeeper. Let them ﬁx
that election. Let them burn those books. Let them
kill those people and those people. Let them all take
care of themselves. _’_We’re taking care of ourselves.

The Pitt News

Thinclads Try for First 

Prognosticator

Calls Panther
Win Over State

Coach Carl Olson's track squad
aims for its first outdoor success of
the season this Saturday when the
Panther spike-wearers invade the
lair of the Nittany Lion at State
College, Pa.

After the Ohio State debacle, the
News prognosticator should prob-
ably give up crystal-balling, but
since his failure to see defeat only
happened once in nine starts he’ll
try again. He goes out on a limb
this Saturday to call a Pitt victory
74-66, thus predicting Pitt’s ﬁf-
teenth win _in its last sixteen starts.

Chief reason for this unquench-
able optimism is the return of
Happy Stickel to the track. The
blonde junior Speedster donned
spike footgear early this week and
claimedlris leg felt as fine as it
ever did. Of course, Barney Ewell,
Penn" ''‘State’s national collegiate
sprint.‘ champion, will have much to
say about the condition of Stickel’s
le.g this Saturday.

Since. Stickel has been out of ac-
tion, aiiirst-class feud has also de-
veloped between Bullet Bill Carter
and the Penn State Flash; conse-
quehtly Saturday's sprint compe-
tition’ looms as the meet’s out-
standing attraction. Ewell’s second
placiéifover Carter in the Penn Re-
laysjlast Saturday was very ques-
tionable, since most of the photo-
graphs in the Sunday papers show-
ed Céir;te1* ahead.

Pitt, however, won’t have to de-
pend“ on first place in both sprints
in Saturday's competition. The
Lions” are woefully weak in the
middle distances. Billy Smith, the
Blue ‘and White’s distance king,
graduated in February and left a
big hole in the mile and two mile,
the only running events in which
Coach Chick Werner’s team showed
any strength last year.

With Larry Tregoning rounding
into’ shape after his prolonged lay-
off,‘three Blue and Gold jerseys
should ﬂash across the line before
a State man. Regis Larkin and
Clyde Graf toured the quarter mile
route under 50 seconds in the Penn
Relays last week.

Del- Anderson ranks by far the
best half miler in the contest, and
Walt Sterner leads the two mile
candidates by yards and yards.
Only in the mile is there likely to
be "a contest, and Mark Allias
should shake one good race loose.

Ted Konetsky has been working
harder than he ever did in the dis-
cus ‘throw and is favored in that.
Bill, Benghauser should win the
shot put. Jim Elliott is the best
javelin thrower in the East; dual
 competition is pie for him.
Dusty Rhoades and Red Jessup are
always at their best against the
Lions, and may take one-two here.

St.ate’s best bets are in the broad
jump and high jump as far as ﬁeld
events go. Ewell, in the former,
and John Glenn, in the latter, seem
to rate best on paper. In the hur-
dles‘ Pitt. stars Joe Newman and
H.ap3Stickel should walk oil"? with
the high timbers and low timbers
respectively.

Mitterlingtnen Strive to Continue

Streak Against West Virginians

Since the athletic office has decided to cut short the two week layoff
of the Pitt baseball team by scheduling a game with the Mountaineers
of West Virginia. Pitt will leave tomorrow morning to meet the orien-
sively poweful West Virginians at Nlorgantown.

Previous to the announcement recently, the Panthers were not to
meet any opposition until M: v 9 when they were to oppose the Moun-

ttainecrs on the Stadium diartiond.

The decision of the athletic otlii-‘a1-r
will raise the number of times the
Panthers will meet the Mountain-
eers from two to _three._

Pitt will enter the game with the
\'v'est Virginia team slightly 1'Lx\'orcd

edge :iri"”the' "pitching department.

sive play will be almost even, since

Mushhall League Race Tightens
As 5 Squads Tie For IF Lead

After having been held to low

scores during the ‘earlier"’part of

the season, the much publicized
sluggers from the PiKA house sent
out six homers in beating Sigma
Chi, 23-9, last Tuesday.

Every man for the Belleﬂeld team
connected for at least two hits, but
it was the long homers of R. Wilde,
Foote, Syka,” Davis, and Anderson
that featured the game. It was not
until the fourth inning when Davis
decided to coast in, that Sigma Chi
could score as Roberts hit a homer
with the ‘bases loaded.

Hitting in the clinches, the Phi
Kaps topped Theta Chi, 19-4, to
give Mike Sotack his fourth straight
victory.

Bouncing back into the win col-
umn, the Sammies again moved in-
to the favorite notch by an im-
pressive 24-2 victory over the
Delts. While the Sammies were
moving up, the Phi Delts moved
further down into the cellar losing
to SAE, 16-8.

Due to a reorganization of the
circuit all Independent teams were
idle last Monday and Wednesday.

But it has been announced by the
intramural ofiice that regardless of
the new plan, all the :previous games
will still count.

The league now includes: the
Cardinals, Debaters, Bus Ads,
Whitesox, APD, Upper Dents, Gam-
ma Gamma Woos, Amity Club,
YMCA, and the Medical Sophs.

Topping today’s games will be
the tussle between two league lead-
ing teams, Phi Kappa and Pi Kappa
Alpha. Also showing championship
colors are the Sammies, defending
titleholders, against Sigma Chi.

Among the other games will be
battles between the Delts and
Lambda Chi A-pha, and the Phi
Delts against Theta Chi.

important I

both teams have provcn themselves
of good caliber in the past.

The Mountaineer lineup will in-
clude three future major leagucr
prospects when they meet the
Panthers. ln catcher Hockenberry,
pitcher Seabright, and infielder
Strauss. the West Virginians boast
plenty of power and defensive skill.

’C‘.ouc‘;i Mitterling will have to
bank oncatcher Guy Guadagnino.
second baseman Eddie Straloski,
and outfielder Frank Goelz to sup-
ply the bulk of the hitting power.
The former two have displayed
plenty of power in previous games
this year, while the latter is ex-
pected to measure up to his 1940
level against the Mountaineers to-
morrow. ' ‘

If we were to base the outcome
of tomorrow’s game on present rec-
ords, the Panthers would have to be
given the edge. However, the poor
West Virginia record is due to the
very slow start which the Moun-
taineers suffered, but which has
been more than corrected. Against
recent opposition, tomorrow’s Pitt
enemy has played ﬁne baseball,
which is a bad sign‘ for the Pan-
thers.

The Pitt bascballers are ex.pect—
ed to rely on either righthander
Bob Malloy or junior Jim Egan to
bear the brunt of the pitching bur-
den. A possibility that Jones may
receive the starting pitching job is
gar fetched since the ace footballer
is suffering from an injured leg and
may not get into the lineup.

In the event that Eddie Jones does
not play, Coach Ralph Mitterling is
expected to use veteran Howard
Updegraf in rightficld. The New
Castle senior performed very well
against the Indiana State nine last
week and should fill the vacancy
satisfactorily.

The Panther squad will probably
be the same as that which made the
Indiana State Teachers trip.

Dr. Raschcn Posseses
Unique ﬂoethe Collection

85’ \7lLLlAM J.-‘AI! ‘EON

A white i:..ii:'er.l old gezttleman t:en:‘oled as he held the actual diary
of Johann VVoli‘g;ing,' von Goethe in his l‘1ClllCl.

The price was >'53.500.

While Dr. Raschen does not have
Goethefs original diary, he does
have a remarkable copy of it. This
edition is printed on paper which
has been reproduced exactly fr-om
the original paper even down to the
‘water marks and stray pencil
marks on the pages.

This illustrates Dr. Raschen's in-
tense interest in Goethe and his
works. After 20 years of work Dr.
Raschcn has completed his own
translation of Goethe's most famous
work, “Faust.”

He attributes his deep interest in
Goethe to the inﬂuence of two for-
mer teachers, Calvin Thomas 01'
Columbia university and Robert
Petscb of the University of Heidel-
berg.

Geo‘he and Science

“Goethe," says Dr. Raschen, “was
5 man in many ways ahead of his
time.

Emerscm who said of him, ‘He was
.3 man who saw out of a thousand

V9?

pores. _

In 21 library which contains over A‘

1.1300 items of treaties. translations,
commentaries, and monographs, Dr,
}RllS£;l’H3Il has one oi‘ the largest col-
lections of Goetheana in existence.

Outstanding in Dr. Rascher’s li-
brary is the ‘.’Veimer edition oi’
Goethe of 142 volumes which '1-
cludes 16 volumes on science and
physics. “Although it is not gen-
erally known," says Dr». Raschen,
“Goethe considered his work in
science more imp0'.t.ant_ than his
writing." V

"Although he was coi"tra.~':licted
by all the leading scientists of the
day. Goethe’s theories on light and
color were proved correct by ‘the de-
velopment of color photography.”
said Dr. -Rasclier... To prove the
point Dr. Raschen stepped over to
the Window of his ofﬁce and illus-
trated Goethe’s theory by means 01‘
the light and shgidow oi‘ the trees
and grass. « '
Influence in Brazil ,

One of Dr. Ras<:lie'ii‘s volun‘-cs is
of plarticulai‘ interest in \.';'ew oi’ the
present world sitiiation. It is 
collection oi‘ speeches and articles
which appeared in nexvspapers in
Brazil. in 1932 during a week's cele-
bration of the centenary oi’ Gcethc’;.-
death. V

These articles and speeches ap-
pearing in 53 iiew.-:papei‘s and form-
ing a siteable volume, siiow strong
German inﬂuence in that ccuz:-try.
There is only one oi:.’.ie: copy of this
parl‘.icu.i.ar \7'ul.L.ii‘~.¢“ and it is in Ger-
many.

In Dr. Raschc.n.'s collection there
is a French edi.ti.o.n of Faust by Paul
Sabatier and E? Gerntan \'ersi=..zn by
Ferdina,nclvSholte, each of which is
the only copy or its kind in the
United States.

Accilsalioils by Dies

AUSTIN. TeX.. May 2.—The Dies
committee has oitcn pointed a fin-
ger at colleges and universities in
various parts of the nation, some-
times accusing faculty members of
spreading un-.~\inericzm “"sm."
Just how much such propaganda
is being spread ti11'ough pedagoglczxl
methods will perhaps never be ac-
curately known.

But it is possible to measure at
least how many students think at-
tempts are being made to influence
them. Student Opinion Sul‘\'(-ys of
America has taken the question di-
rectly to the collegians who some
dc enclers oi’ Americanism claim are
being taught to believe in “wrong”
doctrines:

"Have you even felt that a fuc-
ulty member while teaching in a
class was attempting to inﬂuence
you in iavor 01‘ naziism, fascism,
communism, or socialism?’ The
answers of a representative sample
of students taken the country over
were these:

No . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .799},
YES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
Yes, but apparently not pur-

posely . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . 3"/’

\-

(A very small number, about L
per cent, told Surveys interviewers
that they did not know. Their “no
opinion” answers were not includ-
ed in the tabulations.)

The above ilguresmust be inter-
preted wiih r.e.serv.'-itionsz The stu-
dents who answered were typical
American collegians, andmall. class-
esof students wcrerepiﬁesented, but
-each student’s own deﬁnition of the
“is1ns” and of what constitutes pro-
paganda in favor oi’ those doctrines
no doubt conditioned each answer.
Just the same, these are the an-
swers they gave. to the question,
asl;ed everywhere exactly "as word-
ed.‘ ' ' ' L‘ "

Perhaps even» more significant.

than the niere Iigtires above is the
fact that the pollinakcs possible the
location of the sections'of_thc coun-
try where students believe this
“teaching” of isms is more preva-
lent. The eastern schools repre-
sented in the survey show a much
larger proportion answering in the
aﬁu'n1ai;1ve, while in the south and
especially the west only a few stu-
dents say they have detected any
attcxnpts to inﬂuence them.

'. Hy mu. JAMISON

A crowcl or‘ young; people were
gathcicd around the entrance to
the ziewest Tuck shop l?.l.Sl Tuesday
ar’terno~.:.n. Everyone was anxious
to be first in. The opening had
be-on scheduled for 2 o'clock, and
by 2:20 the crowd was tense.

Two small girls had their noses
plastered up against the new metal
and glass doors. One of these seem-
ed a sure bet to capture the first
coke. I braced myself for the
surge of the crowd that would come
when the doors were opened.

While we were tensed for the
rush, a mob of coke-thirsty stu-
dents were let in by the other door.
i\Vc all ;3,‘roaned loudly.

By the time I got around to the
open door. a sparse crowd was run-

ning around the room trying out
the new blue i'urniture. and many
had already made purchases. Th-9.
person who had made the first pur-
chase could not be found. No one

could remember, and those who
might have remembered wouldn‘t
talk.

I finally found out that Mary
Jane Duncan and Jean Dakcr had
run a dead heat to be first in. They
told me that Raymond L. Coss. su-
perintendent of the department o“
buildings and grounds, had opened
the door.

That was about all. Coss did not
get trampled by the hungry stu-
dents, the doors did not stick. and
there were no broken legs in the
rush. The opening was a flop.

The former president, :1 short.
erect man with a soft voice and a
rlecisi\'e manner spoke in halting
English. From Pittsburgh he will
go to Cleveland and then on to
Chk-ago. "Where are you going alt-
er Chicago‘.”’ we asked him. “I do
not know." he answered. Such is
the life of an exiled president.

Smetona says that he likes Pitts-
bugh. He was particularly attract-
ed by the steel mills and by the
hills and valleys that make up the
landscape.

Everyday he learns something,
says Smetona. Now he is learning
to move quickly. “In America life
is quick,” he says, “Europe moves
very slowly; America is fast.”

To Smetona the Lithuanian room
is an “abundance of culture.” One
of the things that struck him about
America he says is the “iree de-
velopment of culture.” He hopes 0
be able to learn much in America
and take it back to Lithuania.
