Participation Desirable

By JOSIE GROSSMAN

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld labled stu-
dent involvement “very desirable” at his luncheon
for student leaders Tuesday. A

The problem of decision—making is a practical
one, he explained, where the ultimate choice should
be made by those individuals who have a total per-
spective of the University community. .

But, he qualiﬁed, with the complexity of ad-
ministrative, process in an institution of this size,
it becomes “very desirable" to delegate decisions to
both facultyiand students when the matters directly
concern them."

Infact, he concluded, the more you can delegate
to ease the administrative complex the better.

Dr. Litchﬁeld stated that when architects start
plans, for two more tower dormitories in the fall,
students will be consulted on plans for the new stu-
dent center which will replace and develop present
Student Union facilities.

Attending the luncheon were Dr. - Alan C.

' Rankin, assistant chancellor of student and general

affairs; John Vrana, Student Government presi-
dent; Mike Marcuse. Student Union Board Chair-
man; Alice Bilewicz, Associated Women Students
vice-president; Beverly Lichter, Panhellenic presi-

dent; David Marr, general manager of WPGI-1;‘

and Josey Grossman, editor of The Pitt News.

Mellon Fellow in philosophy- for 1963-64 Rich-
ard Burian and administrative intern in the School
of Education Meade Beers, Jr. were guests.

Dr. Alan C. Rankin stated at the Student Affairs
meeting Wednesday that he would “take under ad-
visement” a proposed sub—committee to study the
ﬁnancial needs and problems of student organi-
zations; - ’ A

The assistant chancellor of student and general
affairs said that he was “sympathetic” wtih_ the
proposal of his advisory Student Affairs committee.

The proposed sub-committee developed the

plan Student Government president John Vrana-

submitted last week. Vran_a’s plan provided a stu-
dent—faculty-administrative body to allocate stu-
dent organization budgets under the Student Affairs
ﬁnancial ceiling and subject to Dr. Rankin’s app-
proval.
The new, further-deﬁned plan calls for four
basic objectives: to reviewallocations, to. gather
- information concerning the needs of the diﬁerent
organizations, to assist in determining common
policies of spending for the different organiza-
tions, and to examine the question of when fund-
raising is appropriate and when it is not.
After Dr. Rankin’s comments at the last meet-
ing that the Student Affairs ﬁnancial ceiling was

relatively static, the committee concentrated on

trying to assist organizations to work more effi-
ciently under their present ceilings.
“Such a sub—committee can also examine in-
equities from organization to organization,” Dean

University to Stress
Handling Information

By NANCY DELANEY

The problem of the most efficient and rapid way of,

handling knowledge, from the moment it comes into exis-

major concern of the University in the future. . i

This new ﬁeld of emphasis will be
at commencement on June l,.and will center around the
theme of “Knowledge Availability Systems” (KAS), or the
systems by which information is gathered, catalogued,
stored, retrieved, and .disseminated. Commencement speaker

By SHERMAN CANTER

The Metropolitan Opera
Studio presented an abridged
version of Gaetano Denizet-
ti’s opera “Don Pasquale” on
May 4 at the Stephen Foster
Memorial Hall. The Opera,

under the direction of Edwin Stahl
and the stage direction of Henry
Butler performed to a generally
receptive audience.

Inhibiting the full enjoyment of
the opera, however, was the rather
dull, ineffective acting of Nicholas
DiVirgi1ie as Ernesto, and Dom-
inic Cossa as Dr. Malatesta. Both
players lacked that‘ certain ﬁnesse
which enables an actor to look
at ease on the stage.

In contrast, Anne Elgar gave a.
ﬁne performance as Norine. She
portrayed thepconniving shrew
so convincingly that one could
not help feeling that she ‘had
had much practice at the part.

C. C. Walker Talks

On ‘Nonviolence’

By Ron Caplan

Education, after a certain point,
is very much a matter of being
brought to remember, and being
brought to some personal account
for what’s been forgotten. Charles
C. Walker, member of the Execu-
tive Committee for Nonviolent
Action, reminded a gathering of
perhaps seventy—ﬁve people at
last Wednesday's Midday Series

"that there really are some gen-

trying to do some "good.

He reminded with that special
sort of clarity that makes de-
mands upon all who‘hear, that
brings them from their own small
battles, their own wondering
about their own worth and the
worth of what they hope to do --
to face his dream and to respond,‘
a response, that says something
about" Charles Walker and some-

‘ thing‘ about themselves.

' He reminded that ‘there are
people in this world who would
do their wars with love. I'm sure
he’d object to my calling his meth-.
ods _and objectives the methods
and objectivesof war, but how
else can I describe the ‘sort of
battle he has dedicated his life to:‘
the changing of the, world using
a philosophy of nonviolence as a.
“mode of ..organizing society?” ,
, He ‘ looks forward to the obso-
lescence ofgviolence, that “patho-
logical conflict’.’ — and -he ex-

, selves to all the possibilities of
the world.

If the world is to be possible,
war is no longer a possibility. The
whole system of deterrent of each
holding a bomb over the head of
the other, is a system which
creates the tensions of terror, and
terror is the sense that conﬁnes.
A rational response depends on
the ability to see the possible, and
yet our entire system‘ of deter-
rent, that mode of terror, depends
“on the Russians making _a .ra-
tional response.”

Mr. Walker sees war as being
"replaced by a system of peace,
and warns that we know very
little about peace. “We need .an
institutional conﬂict, control .
’we don’t know what’s* going on
. .. spies are unreliable =—— we
need skilled, knowledgable peace-
makers."

Using a happier sense of an
overused phrase,'he said: ,“Con‘-
scientious objectors. will‘ bury

, cause of the defences theyhave
the last old soldier.”

He was -not talking about any‘

Dr. Donald E. Swartz, president

McGill has about the same
number of full-time, ‘day stu-
dents at Pitt. The main stu-
dent organization is the Stu-
dents’ -Society of which all the
students are members’. Each
faculty and school elects 'a
proportionate number (by size
of membership) of representa-
tives to an executive body: the
Students’. Executive _ Council '
(SEC). This body has about
15 members. Other important
student organizations are: Un-
dergraduate Societies in each
faculty and school, the Union,
the daily newspaper, and over
75 clubs and societies ranging
from the Missile and Rocket
Club to the Film Society. Each
of these groups is recognized
by the SEC when it has a
minimum membership (about
ten). Not eligible for recogni-
tion are fraternities political
and religious groups..

Every year, as part of his tui-
tion, each student pays. a $15
student fee to the university. The
university thereupon pays this
money in a lump sum to the Stu-
dents’ Society. Each student club
or society proposes a budget --
in writing — to the SEC at a
speciﬁed time. The SEC passes
judgment on each of these in
turn and pays the agreed upon
sum to the organization fortheir
use._Past performance, use made

of funds, number of students in- ‘

terested, and amount asked for
in the budget are some of the
considerations upon which
awarding of funds is based.

Purposely omitted from the
foregoing is any mention of
faculty or administrative con-
trol of the se. procedures. _
Oﬁicially, there is none. The.
entire atmosphere is o_ne_ of
separation: the Students’ So-
ciety does not try to tell the
Faculty Club what to do with
its money and the reverse is
also true. However, the Stu-
dents’ Society has four perma-

to the change. At last week’s session the administrative members fought that it was
more efficient to leave decisions to the administration. Students fought for the right
_ to take part in decisions that affected them directly. Only the faculty members urged
“the other two factions to stop discussing personal interests and to get downto the func-
tional meat of the sub-committee’s operation. , ‘ u.

If Dr. Rankin accepts the modiﬁed proposal it will be unquestionably a triumph
for student involvement. But the week of consideration served to temper the spirits of _

‘His function is that of an ad-_

campus that he maintains a

As predicted by Mr. Garﬁnkle,
interest in the SEC (which is
really the counterpart of Pitt’s
SG) is high. At election time
campaigning for various student
posts is vigorous (there are no
parties) and many students be-'
come indistinguishable f r o m
politicians outside of academe.
In fact, the entire governmental
aparatus takes on the atmo-
sphere of a real government.
There are even so-called pres-

— fraternities, the Hillel crowd,
the Engineers, etc. -— who, it is
taken for granted, will vote as
a bloc; and many students, aspir-

ing to olﬁce, will plan a cam-'

paign to appeal to one or more
of these blocs. Naturally, some-
one always feels that an injustice
has been done his organization,
and in this sense the attitude of
the student government is as re-

stitutuents as any other demo-
cratic government. I do ‘not know

Freshman Orientation . . ..

Welcome, Brother!
I i I By Larrysernfeld

Men’s Council is sponsoring a rejuvenated Freshman Orientation
program this summer. Itfwill serve thegdual functiion "of giving the
incoming male freshman a. feeling 0 acceptance, while" at the same
time introducing him to his role in the Uni\rer'sity~community.

— The recruitmentand continuanc.e'.of_ a qualiﬁed freshman class
is audmajor concern of any“ institution of higher‘
-. learning whose primarygoal is teaching students.
"While creation of a freshman class is initially an
' administrative function, to ‘maintain, the interest

.a_dminist1'ation must enlist the aid of the under-
graduate student body. 

The University is fortunate in having more
than one organization on‘ campus‘ that is,./will-
ing to take the time and effort necessary to‘
properly convey that feeling‘ ‘fwhich can con-
tribute _to lowering the ‘student drop-out rate,

~ ‘and prevent‘ “Hail to Pitt” "from ringing hol-
, V lowin your ears. ,

The “new” Men’s Council, under the guidance of »Co-ordinator
Lenny Schwartz and "Vice-Co-ordinator Mark Senick, [serves as a
particularly strong example of the planned attempts to‘ integrate the
incoming— freshmen into ‘the University, thereby continuing the
process which administrative recruitment only begins. 0 1

The core of the Council's plans is the Upper Class Counsel-
lo’r’s program. Jay Adlersberg, program chairman, has charted
an Aextensive Counselling system that‘ will continue at least
through the fall trimester. I  _ _ -

There’ is nothing slap-dash -about this organization. ‘The Upper
Class Counselling Committee conducted lengthy interviews with
prospective counsellors to _see how they would react in handling
test problems, which are likely to concern incoming male freshman.
Beginning this evening and for the three Monday evenings fol-
lowing, the counsellors ‘will participate in intensive training ses-
sions. Adjustment, study, social life and academic life will be the
main topics of discussion. I

The counsellors will live on the same floors, and ‘eat meals
with the freshmen students as far as circumstances allow. The
Counselling Committee, however, realizes that a three day
orientation is only a partial contribution towards their ﬁnal goal.
The counsellors will therefore conduct follow-up session through-
out the fall trimester with the freshmen they worked with dur-
ing the summer months. _

The combined summer and fall programs will provide a per-
sonal contact between upper-classman and freshman. In this man-
ner the Council feels that the freshmen will receive adequate answers-
to their questions, which will stimulate a necessary and proper
interest in the University. _ '

Explains Methodist Schism

   

  REVEREND Paul’ E. Schrading, _this,_ year’s in the Methodist Church as one of humanists     _

head of the University ministry, explains the rift struggling. against conservative inertia.

\ _~ '

e By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

 

The General Conference of the
Can]!/Iethodist Church must solve its
problem or segregation before it
can merge with the Evangelical
United Brethren‘ church. Accord-

ing _to Reverend Paul E. -Schrad-C

ing, ‘the University’s Methodist

Chaplain, the Church 'has pre--

\\_t~}'~viously been divided on this
same issue. , ‘

’ In fact, the Methodist Church,
like the Baptist and Presby-
terian churches, separated into a
northern and southern wing
shortly before the Civil War, due
to racial difficulties.‘ '

,One of the requisites for re-
unification of the Methodist
church in 1939 was the establish-
ment of “the central jurisdic-

'-tion,” which ‘produced de facto
integration. ‘

segregation as‘ its root. The MCR

is. opposed ._to this voluntarism:

and‘ feels the need for a stronger
stand.’ _

. Thus’ far t:he’General Council
has resolved to eliminate the
central jurisdiction. Reverend
Schrading participated in a re-
cent allnight rally with Church
leaders, which was concluded
with a‘ho1y' communion service.
After this, 800 demonstrators
went to the Civic Arena, where

the convention was held, to show .

their “concern that the Church
must realistically face the pro-
blem of segregation within it-
self.” ,
Reverend Schrading felt “the
kneel-in was effective, because
it was not offensive. In the past
he also participated in_ demon-
strations in Jackson, Mississippi
to point out “the ambiguity of a

church’s closing its ‘doors simply
on the basis of race.” ,
In general, Reverend Schrad-
ing, feels “encouraged by many.
of the actions that were taken

(by the conference) towards an
inclusive church.” He especially

noted the resolution of Wednes-— _

day: .
“The Methodist Church . is.
part of the church universal.
Therefore, ‘all persons ’ . . .

' shall be eligible to attend its

~ worship services . . . and to be A

admitted into its membership

anywhere in this connection.”

Various other sources expect
that these resolutions will lead
to a more sensitive proposal,
which might oust pastors who
refuse or aid in refusing admis-
sion to any service or worship
by reason of race, color, or
natural .origin.

Reverend Scharding mentioned
ed that the Methodist Church is
divided into ﬁve different geo-
graphical jurisdictions and that
membership in the central juri-
diction‘ is based solely on race.

Reverend Schrading cited ‘W.
Aster Kirk’s motion for the
abolition of the central jurisdic-

 )tion: “That the Methodist Church
\'record its judgment that, the
Central Jurisdiction Structure of

the Methodist Church not be
made part of the plan of merger

with the Evangelical United
Brethren Church.” Schrading
felt that this was necessary be-
cause “no self-respecting'— Negro

is going to carry this kind of

structure into" the new church.”

Penn State

Blow Past Panthers
W/ith 86-41 Triumph

AL THOMASSEY
Wins Discus Throw

By FRANK SMIZIK

“The wind is a factor,” is a favorite expression of. all.
baseball announcers. That statement also held true on the
cinder paths at Penn State, ‘Saturday, as the Lions. topped

‘ the Panther track team, 86-41. '

’Almost all of the times were extremely poor, yet _the wind‘
helped the Lions capture two titles in the javelin and pole vault.
“The wind had been blowing continuously throughout ' the whole
meet and when the pole vaulters tried to get over_ the starting.

_ height of eleven feet only one Penn State man could make it (Tom
Pinkerton),” explained ‘Panther coach Carl Rees.

“At the end of the meet when the pole vault was being ﬁnished ‘
the wind died down and Pinkerton set

was 15-feet- 1/2 -inch.‘

“The javelin was the only event where the win aided the
performers. Penn State’s George Terza threw the javelin 228-

feet- 3 - inches.

The Panthers could only manage foL1r firsts out of the 15 events.
- Bill DelVecchio' won the 100-yard dash, Luddy Hayden was ﬁrst in
- the broad jump, Al Thomassey took the discus and Dick Crout won

the 440-yard dash.

Netters Lost To West Virginia;
Sophomore Player Looks Good

L Despite a windy day and the
loss of two players Saturday, the
Panther tennis team made one of

its best showings while losing to.

_West Virginia, 6-3. Dave Orth,
the team's number six man was
out because of an injured toe, and
Bob Guzzardi was out because of
illness in his family.

The match went just as coach
Ben Pope had forecasted, when he
said, “West Virginia has about the
same team as last year, but we

‘can claw at them.” The netters

'- did claw at the Mountaineers, and

.the biggest surprise of the day
was the play of Pitt's sophomore
Tom Barber.

Barber replaced Bob Throw-
bridge as number seven man
prior to the match and played
as sixth man because Orth was

and our boys did very well and I

injured. Playing in his first var-
sity match, Barber won his
singles match and teamed with
Throwbridge to win a doubles
match.

Pope said, “Tom played a good
game and out fought his man. He
showed a display of determina-
tion that spurred on the other
boys. I think he’s going to get
ahead.” This was evident because
last year's team, which Pope has.
said was better than this year’s
team, only scored one point
against the Mountaineers.

Pope said, “West Virginia was
not any weaker than last year,

think they've got a good chance
of beating West Virginia this Fri-
day at Carnegie Tech.”

Baseball Team Loses Both Games
In Last Inning; NCAA Hope Dims

Thursday, the Panther baseball team left Pittsburgh on a trip to Carlisle, Pa. on
Friday to play Dickinson, and to Annapolis, Md. on Saturday to play Navy. Two wins would
have given the Panthers a chance at the NCAA'section 2 bid. But the Panthers lost. both
games, and returned here with a 5-6 collegiate record, a 7-6 record overall, and no NCAA

hopes.

in nine innings.

The Panthers went

9-7. They tied the game in the

ninth, but lost it ’in the bottom of’

the tenth inning when Dick Her-
man led off with a home -run to
right field. ,

Tie Game in Ninth

The Panthers tied the game in
the ninth inning when Brian Fish-
er forced Larry Szykowny at sec-
ond base, Ferd Sauer and Dave
Reichenbach walked to load the
bases, and Barry ,Wetze1 singled

I to drive in two runs.

Dave Sauer, ‘Panther right
hander, — started the’ game, but

A gave way to Carl Oettinger after
‘giving up‘ four runs. (see story on

next page); Sauer was followed
by Carl Oettinger, Leek Brueckel,

and» Andy Alex, who 1-lost the 
igame. _ ' A ' ‘_ ‘ ’

The Panthers scored_,.nine runs”
against Dickinson Pitcher Dave!

Ditenhafer, on .17 hits ‘and eight
walks. Ozf their hits, however,

only two were for extra -bases,-T

‘Saturday the Panthers dropped
below the .500 mark as the Mid-

shipmen scored three ‘runs in the‘
bottom of the ninth off 'Roger‘

Johnson.

The m'idshipi‘nen scored allfﬂtheiri
runs with two outs in the inning;
v A two run pinch-hit home run by

Tom Burrow was the deciding‘ hit
of the game.

Had the Panthers won both,

games, they would havebeen '17-4‘,
with an excellent chance at an
NCAA tournament bid. It appears
now, however‘, that» Penn State
will draw the bid.

Once again this past weekend,
the Panthersshowed an inability’
to combine their hitting, pitching,

and ﬁelding. In the game against_

Dickinson, although over 25 Pan-

Pitched Well Against Bucknell,

Dave Sauer Looks

  Like Third

Y Starter

The Panther baseball team boosted its record to '5-4
with two wins in Pittsburgh. The ﬁrst win was against
Duquesne University’s Dukes at Herschel Field behind
Roger Johnson on Monday. Tuesday, lefthander Dave Bly-
shak gave up four hits to lead the Panthers to a 2-0 win
over California State College at Leech Farm Field.

As the scores indicate, strong?
Panther pitching was again the

primary r e a —
s o n s for the
w i n s . “O u r
pitching ha s
been g r e a t,”
Coach B ob b y
Lewis beamed.
L e w i s has a
right to beam.
In the past four
games, Panther
mounds—' Sauer

men have yielded a ‘ total of -four

 

runs.

‘But one of the biggest surprises
for Lewis last week was the suc-
cess of Dave Sauer, the six-foot-
three—inch right hander. Sauer’
pitched against Bucknell Satur-
day, and pitched his ﬁrst complete
game of the season. The game, ac-
cording to Lewis, was Sauer’s ﬁrst
nineginning performance, includ-
ing exhibitions, and ' practice
games. ’

, Lewis had said in the begiiining
of the season that he was hoping
Sauer could be his third starter.
His dream. was apparently ful-
ﬁlled last Saturday.

Sauer showed a variety of

_pitches in defeating‘ Bucknell- He

counted on_ his curve ball and
change of pace pitches in the early
innings, and relied more on his
fastball in the later innings.

After Sauer yielded his two
runs in the sixth inning, Lewis
became worried, and even con-
sidered removing his starter from
the ball game. B.ut Sauer started
using his fastball, and blanked
his opponents through the remain-
ing three innings.

“Dave seemed to get stronger
as he went along,” catcher Doug
Chambers said after the game.
“His control was good. I have no
complaints about the way he
pitched today. His curve ball and
fastball were both moving real
nice.” -

ing hitter on the team. He col-
lected three hits in his last eight
times at bat to drop his average

‘THE rrrri NEWS.‘ --

Automation is replacing th e
manual labor of sending out some
900 subscriptions of Pitt’ News."

Since the increased sales cam-
paign for subscriptions began last

_ lear, 400 new subscriptions were

ordered. The papers are sent to

~ about 300 on-campus professors

and employees, and about 700 pa-
pers are sent off campus to other
colleges, subscribers and alumni.

The shortage of manpower on
the business staff and the con-
tinuous hard labor "of manual-
addressing compelled the News to

‘hire Western Newspaper Print-

ing Corp., the paper’s printer, to
address the subscriptions by ma-
chine.

The cost of automation will be
more but with less than 200 addi-
tional subscriptions the News will
not have a loss.

According to Donald Friedman,
Business Manager, “We had ex-
panded beyond the scope of our
capabilities.” v

With Pasquale

As a boost to the University's
new. Spring trimester activities
program, The Metropolitan Opera
Studio was contracted to perform
“Don Pasquale” on campus at a
cost of "two-thousand dollars.

The company performed to an
opening night audience of 400, in-
cluding 150 high school students,
in Stephen Foster Memorial Hall.
Second night attendance dwin-
dled to 150. The hall has a seat-
ing capacity of 670, including 500
good seats.

Though the students did not
take advantage of these perfor-
mances, the University hopes to
give them another chance in the
Fall.

Can you avoid
living in “Jamsville”‘.'

,It Won’t be easy. By 1980- most Amer-

icans will live in 40 large metropoli-
tan areas—-each with more than a mil-
lion population. To keep your com-
munity from becoming a ‘.‘J amsvil1e”
will take people with ideas—ideas
,hat can help cities move more trafﬁc
zwiftly, safely and economically.
Someoftheideascomefromthemen
and Women of General Electric Who,
.n effect, form a “Progress Corps."
In major cities, they’re helping to
.levelop balanced transportation
built around rapid rail-transit sys-
tems . . . and they’re providing
advanced equipment to power and
control the trains. They’re also devel-
oping a TV monitoring system that
enables a_ single engineer to control
miles of auto traﬂic . . . a jet engine

that speeds commuters in a hydrofoil
ship over the waves . . . and another
jet engine to lift" travelers over traffic
via turbocopter at _150 mph.

Trafﬁc is only one of many prob-
lems General Electric people are
working on. Their numerous proj-

‘ects, in this country and- around the
World, demand a variety of talents:
engineering, ﬁnance, marketing, law,
physics and many others.

If you’d like to join the “Progress
Corps” after graduation, talk to your
placement director. He can help qual-
iﬁed young people begin their careers
at General Electric.
