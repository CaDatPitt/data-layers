Today’s meeting marked the third
model state legislature sponsored by
the ICG. The ﬁrst conference was
held in 1934 and took the form of a
model state constitutional convention.

In 1935 and 1937 model legislatures
were featured. The presidential elec-
tion year, 1936,
was marked by a

convention. At last

(Ff Egyptian Law

Sudden. complications .in the. .plan-
ned settings of the 1939 Cap and
Gown show, “At Your Service,” have
arisen, it was announced late Wed-
nesday. These may necessitate re-
writing the plot of the show.

Original plans called for much of
the show’s action to take place in
Egypt, where the “At Your Service”
concern is engaged in digging for
an ancient mummy, containing the
secret of a rare perfume, but ad-
vices from the New York Royal Con-
sulate of Egypt state that permission
to excavate “is granted only to bodies
devoted to scientiﬁc purposes.”

Hassan Moharram, consul general
in New York, has notiﬁed the Cap
and Gown Club that inasmuch as “At
Your Service” is not a scientiﬁc
body, it stands little chance of re-
ceiving a permit to excavate.

Mr. Moharram, in a gracious man-
ner, has stated that there might be
a possibility, according to the Egyp-
tian Almanac, a regulation of De-
cember 8, 1912, provides: “Applica-
tions for permission to excavate
should be sent to the Department of
Antiquities before October 25 of each
year.”

Under this regulation the 1939 Cap
and Gown show could not appear “in
Egypt” before 1940, and Theodore
W. Biddle insists that “At Your Serv-
ice” will open in the Nixon theater
Monday, May 1, at 8:28 o’clock.

Aides to Help Voters in Elections
Today in Soldiers’ Memorial Hall

 

A
V

By Harold Wintner

A complete election system em-
ploying a great number of student
aides, 14 county voting machines
and a demonstrator, and five men
from the county to assist in their
use, has been set up in Memorial
Hall today in order that University
students may elect their represen-
tatives to Student—Faculty Associa-
tion, College Association, and Men’s
_C0uncil.

RED-HOT SPIRIT

Polls will be open until 5:30
o’clock to accommodate what is ex-
pected to be the heaviest balloting
in years. This is due to the red-hot
election spirit whipped up by Jack
Hoeveler, C40, and his Independent
Party, a long-shot for a long time,
but today a serious threat to sweep
the student offices.

In the Fifth Avenue lobby of the
Hall each student will receive a little
blue card as his official permit to
vote. This card will follow the stu-
dent to the voting machines, then to
the Men’s Council ballot box and
then to the exit. And if the voter

doesn’t have his little blue card when
it comes time to leave, he mayhave
some trouble leaving.

This is the design of Bernard May-
er, C39, chairman of elections, who
hopes to prevent the recurrence of
last year’s rumors, which said that
some of the boys stayed around Me-
morial Hall until they got tired push-
ing levers.

After signing the blue card and
having it checked, the student turns
to the voting machine. College stu-
dents will use the six machines on
the right to vote for SFA and Col-
lege Association, while all others will
use the eight machines on the other
side to vote SFA alone.

VVORRIES SOLVED

Instruction for use of the ma-
chines will be handy enough so that
the students need not worry before-
hand how he will get his vote
through.

From the machines, the voter con-
tinues down the hall in the general
direction of the Bayard street exit.
Women, having their. blue card
checked along the way, will proceed
directly to the _exit._ Men, however,
will deposit their Men’s Council bal-
lot in a box plainly marked, before
going on to the exit.

The Campus Electorate
Asks ‘W/110’ and ‘Wily’

URING the course of today’s election, Memorial hall 'ill be lit-

tered with colored slate cards

as some 2,000 students work th'eir

Way through a maze of voting machine buttons and paper ballots.

As a result of the day canipaigning. students will be elected to
offices in Stii(leiit—Faci1lty Association, College Association, and I\[ei1’s
Council. Most interesting question to the spectators of today 's action
is obviously, "'\\'ho will be elected.’'’ Probably more pertinent is
the <,‘iicstion, “\Vhy is anyone being elected?”

Leaders of the Independent

party. with a list of candidates

“chosen on merit,” claim that their purpose is to revitalize student
governinent, which has been deadened, they say, because of long con-

trol by fraternity elements. The.

cent of non—i'raternit,' students on

. , . 4 1.
Independents are repeating their;
more or less traditional claim of representiiig the inarticulate 85 per:

campus.

The l’:-atei-iiities are in an unusual position this year. They are

actually on the defensive. largely

because of the threat of 1,000 re-

puted lndepc-iidcnt votes iiiai-slialerl behind the three slates lined up
by l<=arlt-ins Hoeveler and Stark. The fraternity leaders are ﬁghting
ﬁre with ﬁre by presenting candidates also “chosen on merit," and by
asserting that more fI'tll€l'lill}' affiliation is no reason for depriving

able students of campus offices.

If revitaliz.=itimi of student goveriunciit is the outstanding issue,
as Imlcpeiirleiit leaders claim, their group is more likely to accom-
plish that aim than the fraternities. This year Coalition certainly
did not cause any startling change in student affairs.

It is possible that the Independents are sincere in their expressccl
intention to make of student government, particularly SFA, more tlian
a device for the routine perforniance of coininittees and dance cliair-

ITICII.

But to us it seenis doubtful that either the Independents or the
fraternities can make of student office-holding anything more than a
type oi.‘ popularity honor, and of student _;f.'0V(?l'lllll€lll' aiiything more
than a conveiiient adjunct to the offices of the deans of men and

VVOIIIGII.

government organizations cannot

raternity men and liidepeiulcnts alike have found that student

“do big tliings" siniply because

they have no adniinistrative and ﬁnancial power.

On other college campuses, stiiideiit gt,-vei'iiiiiei1ts have been known
to actually function. But. because of long experience with the Uni-
vcrsit.y’.~; student govei-hing groups, we can hardly blame the student
body for liaving a “you ’ve-got-to—sl1ow—us” attitude.

Regardless of which party wins today’s election, students will
gain useful experience in nianipulating voting machines, the County
Bureau of Elections will come in for a lot of free publicity, and
“I'Ionest Burl” Mayer and his band of fearless deputies will see to it
that all repeaters are checked at the door ct’ Memorial hall.

be settled for a bit, until the faculty
gets around to making the final de-
cision on what will happen to SFA.

What will happen at the polls?
Well, both independent and frater-

nity parties will elect enough people '
to get three people each on the ex—.

ecutive committee, thus throwing the
balance of power to the three faculty
members on the committee. Both
sides will be too evenly balanced in
the assembly, which will make the
outcome of the election of SFA
president dependent on the ten fac-
ulty members.

So the faculty, in fact, a poll of
the office of the dean of men, and of
the dean of women, will tell who is
going to be what next year.

I’vc got :1 little list which appears
below, of who will be elected by the
suidcnt bocly, but before you read
them. let me say this: It the weather
is bad. and it rains between eleven
and tvo-thirty. the fraternities will
put in three slates, and all the rest
of.’ their candidates; but only if the
we:it'cc1' is bad.

It‘ the weather’s all right the re-
sults will show a 15-15 split like this
in Monday morning’s News:

Sem'o_r Men-

Hoeveler, Cusick, Dimit, White-
man, Shepherd, Naric, Adams, Krist-
ufek, Starzynski, Taano.

Senior Women-

Shiring, Broido, Megee, Letsche,

Cleland.

Junior M en-

Roberts, Konetsky, M c E l w a in,
l Buente, Aldisert, Goodwin, Tucker,
Roth, Powell, Bacall.

Junior Women-
, Carrier, Pyle, Marcuson, Lewis,
! Toddie.
Now about the questionable items:
 the engineers come out, it’s Mack-
ey instead of Taano. If Mercedes
Shfring doesn’t get such big vote,
Betty Davis might edge in ahead of
Dorothy Cleland; and frankly, junior
women are an unknown quantity.
; CA will be run by Stark, Kris-
'tufek, Camarata, and Jafle.

When it comes to Men’s Council,
you put down your money and take
your choice. Who is going to get
elected, or what for, is an interest-
ing but not vital question.

Take a look at Campus Canvass
today, and note the item by Bill
“Legs” Iloevclei‘. There’s going to be
no living in the Hoeveler household
i‘eg:;1‘clless of what happens today.

You can also note the quote of
Louise Finkelstein. I may say that
it‘ this is what our teachers are going
to be like, heaven help the next gen-
eration. If she wasn’t being funny,
maybe she can explain to the ones
who are elected just what it is that
can be grafted in school politics. If
there is something, I’ve been wast-
ing my time being a reporter.

Maybe after the results are pub-
lished, it will prove I’ve been wast-
ing my time, anyhow.

Men’s Council positions will be ﬁlled by votes cast according to schools
on paper ballots which will be handled separately from the SFA votes cast
on the County-owned voting machines. Ten positions in this group are
open: ﬁve from the College, two from the School of Business Administra-
tion, and one each from the Schools of Engineering, Mines, and Education.

A vvrite—in campaign is being conducted by the Independent party in
behalf of Sherman Jubilerer, BA42, candidate for sophomore position from
the School of Business Administration.

A doubtful factor for the Independent Party this year is the support of
the Engineers who have recently taken little interest in campus politics.

Dental students are backing one of the fraternity slates this year. This

situation, unusual for campus politics, is a result of the Independent-Dent— _
Fraternity coalition which swept 27 out of 30 positions in the present as- i

sembly of SFA.

Last year’s coalition met little opposition when a hastily-organized In-
dependent party, led by Hoeveler and Brooks Sipes, C39, nominated 12
candidates on 2 slates. Two Independent candidates, Gertrude Broido, C40,
and Mary Gregg, C40, were elected when Mercedes Shiring, Ed40, received
466 votes and outran the rest of the fraternity slate.

batters with an average of .363. according to the official averages ‘re-

All candidates for the freshman
baseball team are asked to report
to Coach Ralph Mitterling at Gate

At this time, a practice schedule
for the fresh will be worked out.

Al Holbrook, smooth ﬁelding second

Delts Defeat Sigma Chi To Gain

lntertraternity Second Flace

Wet weather kept Phi Delta The—¢
ta’s undefeated mushball nine out of '

action Tuesday permitting it to main-
tain ﬁrst place with ﬁve consecutive
victories. ,

Delta Tau Delta assumed undis-
puted possession of second place,
trimming Sigma Chi, 14-4. “Red”
Krunkleton twirled for the winners
and Coates was on the mound for the
losers.

The Delts clinched the game in the
first half of the first inning sending
seven runs across the plate. Four
more runs were added in the third
inning and the fourth frame produced
the ﬁnal three.

Sigma Chi pushed over two runs
in each of the two opening innings
and went the remainder of the game
without completing the circuit.

Pi Kappa Alpha came through with
a “Frank Merriwell” ﬁnish to nose
out Lambda Chi Alpha, 9-8 in the
ﬁnal half of the last inning.

The losers grabbed a three run lead
in the ﬁrst inning and continued in
front till the last of the sixth when
the ultimate winners tied the score
at 7-7. The ﬁrst of the seventh saw
Lambda Chi regain the lead with a
single tally only to be beaten out by
a two—run rally in the ﬁnal half of
the inning.

“Lefty” Ray Light hurled the com-
plete game for the PiKa’s and Bob
Angros did likewise for Lambda Chi.

Tomorrow’s games pit Sigma Alpha
Mu against Sigma Chi with Phi Delta
Theta facing Light and Pi Kappa Al-
pha at 10:00; the following hour, Phi
Kappa battles Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and Kappa Sigma meets Phi Gamma
Delta. At 1':00 Lambda Chi Alpha
goes against Phi Epsilon Pi, and Pi
Lambda Phi will strive for its fourth
victory against Theta Chi.

Y Club——W7ill Hea1—°—I:ight

Ray Light, C39, president of the
College Association, will speak at
the weekly meeting of the YMCA
Friday Freshman club today at 12:30
o’clock, announces Ed Tait, C42,
president of the club.

His topic will relate to campus pol-
itics and other material regarding to-
day’s student elections.

N et Squad
Meets State

Pitt’s varsity tennis team will meet
Penn State at State College in the
season opener tomorrow. Two previ-
ous matches which were to have in-
augurated this year’s schedule were
rained out.

Returning from last year’s number
2 spot, Joe Kristufek will head the
team at number 1 in tomorrow’s en-
gagement, while veteran Adrian
Hartman holds forth at Joe’s old
number 2 spot.

The remaining four positions on
the team are uncertain at the present
time, but will probably be ﬁlled from
among Carl Kaufman, Tim Raker,
Byron McLaughlin, Larry Smith, Jim
Bowman, and Dick Harmuth. Kauf-
man is another holdover from last
year’s squad.

The other ﬁve boys are newcomers
and although most of them were
given little chance to stick after the
opening practices, all have come
come along remarkably since then. 

On Monday the Panther netters'
will play their ﬁrst home match on
the Trees Gym courts with Geneva
as the opposition.

Panther Golf Team
Opens With Tartans

The Alcoma Country Club will be
the scene of the opening golf match
for the Panther swingers when they
engage the Tech Tartans Saturday
afternoon.

Tony Kay, Bill Daddio, and Ed
Lawry are sure of teeing off for
Coach Snyder’s team, but the remain-
mg three positions are uncertain.
The above three mentioned players
won varsity letters last year together
with Frank Souchak and George
Simpson who have gone by way of
giaduation and Barrett Melvin, Wa-
mango ﬂash, who dropped out of
school.

Undefeated in Eastern Association
match play last year, Tony Kay, the
consistent performer from Harwick,
has won for himself the number one
slot in the Panther line-up. Bill
Daddio will follow with Lawry play-
ing three or four.
