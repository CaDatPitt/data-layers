Log off i  
computers
    to protect -3
passwords

Byjoshua Won-

A functionality of Google Chrome
allows users to extract passwords
from my.pitt.edu webmail when —
students leave their accounts
signed in to campus computers.

But a Pitt Computer Services
and System officer said that the
issue isn’t unique to the browser
and students just need to take one
step to keep their passwords safe
when using those computers --
log out. _

As long as students log out and
close browser sessions when they
ﬁnish using campus computers,
their passwords are safe from
extraction or being stolen by the

computer’s next user. John Hud— V

son, an information security of-
ﬁcer with CSSD, said that the email

’ session as well as the password

that is transmitted across a net-
work is encrypted — not saved
into a computer’s memory.

“We are aware, but this isn’t a
Google Chrome issue — all brows-
ers behave in a similar fashion. It’s’
like leaving your card in front of an
ATM or if someone left their bank
account open. It’s only arfissue if
the session is left open,” Hudson
said. “Any time you log into a web-
based program, a portal or a bank
account, for example, log out.”

If students do not log out from"
their webmail, a simple right-click
option on Google Chrome allows
the user to view the logged-in user-

.name and password.

Pitt fraternity collects
blankets for_ Wrap W
 llpAmenea   

By Megan Trimble
,_  sForThe Pitt News

Members of Pitt’s Greek Life
took Saturday afternoon to re-
live their childhoods by tying
together multicolored blankets
and draping them from precari-
ously constructed taped-together
white pipes in the ‘Belleﬁeld Hall

gYm- V, .
Running in and out of the

structures, the participants‘

risked toppling the swaying pipes
byadding blankets to the tow-
ers that rose from the ground

— in contorted shapes. After the

tower building competition, the
blankets were donated help those
in need. . ‘

‘,‘,It’s fun to see college kids
giddy, crawling around and

building forts. It allows us to be .

little kids again,” said sophomore
Kelsey Hughes, a member of the
Chi Omega sorority who partici-
pated in the event. 1 _
. Pitt’s Sigma Chi fraternity and
representatives from on—campus
"sororities participated in bring-
ing Wrap Up America, an organi-
zation that collects blankets for
those in need, to Pitt for Sigma
Chi’s second annual Wrap Up
America blanket drive. '
The three—hour event, which
drew hundreds of Greek Life par-
ticipants, took place from 1 to 4

p.m. Saturday. The organization_

collected 2,290 blankets to give
to the greater Pittsburgh com-
munity. ‘ .

“We are very excited to put on
this event for the second year,”

. _ ‘

said sophomore Andrew Hansen,
Sigma Chi’s campus representa-
tive for Wrap Up America. “I feel
like the organization ‘is a good
way for people to get involved in
a great cause and students are
able to give back to those less
fortunate who, under different
circumstances, could begin our
place.”

Wrap Up America is an emerg-
ing non—proﬁt organization based
in Louisville, Ky., that partners
with college campuses and their
organizations to collect blankets
for distribution to community
members in need.

This year, Pitt beat its goal of
2,000 blankets donated and part-
nered with The Salvation Armyfs
Project Bundle.—Up to arrange for

. the blankets to be distributedlto

shelters in the Greater Pittsburgh
area. This number surpassed last
year’s collection of 1,100 blan-
kets. .

“We’ve collected 2,290 blan-
kets to set the record for the most

"blankets donated in a single Wrap

Up. event,” Hansen said. “We’ve
gotten so many involved because
we offer a fun competition for the
participatingsororities.’’ .
Trevor Joelson, president of
the Wrap Up America organiza-
tion, attended the event to_sup—
port the expansion of the organi-
zation to Pittsburgh and to share
the story behind the inspiration
of the event. .

father’s' eampailgn for mayor in
Toledo, Ohio, in 1993. As he
parked his truck to hang up a
campaign sign, a man jumped
out of a cardboard box in front
of the truck and asked, “Hey man,
why are you parking in front of

ﬁwq#i$e?t>ﬁg:7v.“ ﬁ.,p

? ” :“lil'/ﬁfifather was not scared,
butfihieliivas taken aback that this
poverty was happening in his
hometown where he was living,
working and raising his children,”
Joelson said. “The first thing that
he could think to do was get a

 

-blanket from his home and give

it to that man who in turn said,
‘Thank you.”’
Joelson established the Wrap

Up America organization in’

1994-‘ A

“The need for blankets is
undeniable,” Joelson said. “But
charity has to also be fun, so we
developed a stimulus for giving.
People know thatgiving to those
in need is right, but they have
to have the drive to actually do
it, and pairing donations with a
competition provides that drive
to give.”

Hansen and his Sigma Chi
brothers worked withjoelson to
bring that drive to Pittsburgh.

T Sigma Chi paired up with mem-

, bers of other sororities to expand

the reach of their donations.- By
pairing ﬁve brothers, acting as
site supervisors, with each soror-
ity ‘team, the groups were able
towork togethertoproduce the
forts with the donated‘ blankets
each group brought. Thewblanketsp
were either: gently used, newlyv
purchased from local  or
bought through Wrap Up.}Amer—
ica’s online buying system.

The online donation system is

A run through Wrap Up America’s
online website and allows those.

who donate to choose acampus,
team and the number of blan-
kets to give. The site uses Pay-
Pal’s nonproﬁt portal to collect
the donations prior to the event.
Blankets are then purchased -in
bulk and_de-livered to the fort
building site. . T
Participating teams build
blanket forts with their collected
blankets and PVC pipe pieces to
compete for trophies. Groups can
win the grand prize or qualify
for several honorable mention
categories, including most no-

table design, most structurally ‘

sound and overall enthusiasm.

The pipes support the blankets,
and tea-ms can trade out blankets
for other materials;

The sorority teams,partici—
pated withthe goalof earning

the ‘$150 ‘grand prize to donate‘

to a charity of their choice.’
Hansen, along with a judging
panel of Sigma Chi alumni, de-
clared the Delta Zeta sorority the
grand prizewinner with the best
 if<_il’t§f'TheZ;Wi,nner’s trophy will be
,i."engrga;¢rdlein:1 passed down to
_»‘_team as the event
continuesl{i?n='the future.
The focus of the event, and the
‘ goal of the organization, is to col-
lect blankets, but students found
that building forts and participat-
ing in acompetition is a positive
incentiveto get involved.
Junior Melissa Berman, a
member of the Chi Omega soror-
ity, said the event’s purpose was
much greater than just allowing
college students to build forts. V

‘’ “The event allows people to,

socialize and have fun, but it also
raises awareness of our city’s
homeless community,” Berman

_ said..“It makes a difference to be ' T
able to see in one place howmany ~

blankets are collected‘. Each blan-
ket goes to_a person, and we can
see how many people’ are actually
in need of them.”

Hansen shared hislhopes for

the future of Pitt’s involvement

with-Wrap Up America. He said
that while Greek Life has been
“a driving force’? in Wrap Up at
Pitt,he hopes to expand his part-
nerships _with other on—campus
organizations, such as the Path-

ﬁnders, the Blue and Gold Society T

and Student Government Board,

among others. ‘ ‘ ’
“The way my Sigma Chi broth-

. for us right now. We hope to some

day be able to provide foo_d and
shelter along with the blankets
to help people fully get back on
their feet,” Hansen said. A

lege kids come together fora
cause,” Hughes said. -

Senior Lauren Hunter joined’

her Tri Delta sisters in tompeting

prize. ' - -

“It’s a lot of fun to be'com- ~

petitive, and the event is a good
way to get everyone together and

Hunter said, V  _ _

“Sigma Chi always does a great
job with their philanthropy and
they’re giving us’ the opportunity
to raise money for our own so we

Katie Hoetzer, a junior majoring in so-

ciology and urban studies, has worked as a ,

computer lab consultant since last semes-
ter. _ . ’ ..
She said that from her experience cov-
ering the tech labs at the Hillman Library,
Alumni Hall and the Cathedral of Learning,
most students remember to log out when
they ﬁnish their sessions. .

“Once or twice a month,‘ when closing
[a lab], there’s a person who forgot to log
off, but it doesn’t happen too frequently,”
Hoetzer said.

John Hudson found that most ‘frequently,
issues of security breach occur not because
of log-off oversight, but because of danger-

'ous online activity. A

“Never click on a link if you are not sure
what it is. Some [links] can download mal-
ware with keyloggers,” he said._

Hudson said that keyloggers are system
monitors that track a user’s keystrokes and
send the data back to a malicious user. These
monitors can give access to virtually all of a
victim’s online information. '

Also, malicious third parties often

-“phish,” or send students emails requesting

personal information by posing as an ofﬁcial
University email or‘a local bank. Hudson
said that there is the potential for hundreds

of thousands of these attacks on PittNet,
Pitt’s Internet network, each month.

“No reputable organization will ever ask
for a password by email,’,’ he said. “We will
never ask for it, nor should anyone else. We
spend a lot of time telling students that you
will never get an email, Facebook or Twitter
message asking for these details.” _

Still, a number of Pitt students fall prey
to online assaults each week, and Hudson
said that Pitt’s online securityteam can catch

when a student’s proﬁle is attacked in some

circumstances — when there is a password
failure, 24-hour surveillance security can
detect it. But, there are limits to the feature
— it usually latches on when the network
receives a large number of requests, far more

than someone/mistyping their password.

“We aren’t looking for fat ﬁngers, but if
a computer is failing attempts at password
login many times a minute —- for example,
with a dictionary tool — we’ll contact the
student. If we can’t contact the student,
wemay disable the account until they can
change their password or ﬁx the malware,”
Hudson said.

Nevertheless, surveillance is an impre-
cise science. Network security cannot see
students’ data or content, just their trafﬁc
patterns. It’s the trafﬁc of data that helps
alert CSSD to suspicious patterns to deter-
mine whether or not a student’s‘In_ternet se-
curity has been compromised by malware.

“This isn’t like CSI where you click a few
buttons and see what’s going on. There’s a

privacy issue,” he said. “Our job is to protect

you, not to see what you’re doing.”

Of course, with this insurance of privacy
comes a compromise of security. Not all
malware uses a large amount of data, so it
will not necessarily be picked up by security.

Oftentimes, malicious programs can go un-

detected while invading a student’s academic

and ﬁnancial information.
Hudson said that students should follow t

these procedures to insure safety online:
installing up-to-date anti-virus software and
patching systems, both of which are avail-
able free to students by CSSD, and routinely
changing their passwords. T’

He said that this is the reason Pitt stu-
dents must change their my.pitt password
before Thursday as part of the‘ Computing
Service’s Internet safety campaign.

, “There’s no good way to tell [if a pass-
word has been stolen] unless they do.some-
thing unusual, so you should always change
it regularly. My suggestion" is to change it
every month —- you don’t have to wait until
we tell you to,” Hudson said.

As of now, Hudson approximates that

~ only half of the students have changed their

passwords, even though the deadline is three
days away and those who haven’t changed it

P by then will be barred from access to PittNet

until they do so. ' .

Freshman Grace Kim has yet to change
her password, and doesn’t understand why
anyone would want to access her informa-
tion. . ,

“I’m waiting until the last minute to
change my Pitt user password,” she said.
“Like, who’s going to hack into my account?
And why would they make the password so
hard?” she said, citing herfrustration at the
symbols and numbers that Pitt requires to
be blended into the password.

But Hudson said that everyone needs

to make an effort for safety, and password _

diversity is an important part of online de-
fense.

“Unless you’re a millionaire, online crim-
inals are looking for easy targets,” he said,
challenging students to take full advantage
of the free protection software that the Uni-
versity provides. “It takes a minimal effort.
You’re helping us help you.”

‘Placate orbett with transparency

_By_'adhering to Right-to~Know, Pitt conld maintain state support

. By Matt Schaff
Columnist

When you place a governor in a ring
with a family of hungry panthers,
you typically don’t bet on the politi-
cian. After all, the ability to shake
votes out of a state caucus doesn’t
seem like adequate preparation for
a close—quarters encounter with a

creature that can shake the life out

of a grown deer using monstrous
fangs and superior musculature.

' But unfortunately for Pitt stu-
dents, faculty and staff, ourfangs

haven’t grown in yet. And more to '

our misfortune, unlike most solitary

panthers, our livelihood appears ‘

to rely on the altruistic caprices
of the governor against whom we
face off — an eaten Tom Corbett
doesn’t exactly make for sufficient
state appropriations and painlessly
balanced University ﬁnances.
That’s why Pitt and other state
and state—related universities are
currently on high alert. After sus-
taining two rounds of deep appro-
priation cuts over the past eight
months, Pitt could face further
blows when Gov. Tom Corbett un-
veils his.2012—13 state budget pro-
posal tomorrow. And as Corbett’s
office has repeatedly lamented

' smallerfthan-predicted tax reve-

nues in the recent past, it’s hard to
believe Pitt’s going to ﬁnd itselfwith
a larger pile of state cash next year

+ let alone the 11 percent increase
we, in a bout of wishﬁil thinking,
requested last October.

_ If this frenzy of higher educa-
tion fund—slashing is to continue,
tomorrow. and beyond, there must
be some point where Pitt makes
an important, game-changing de-
cision: going private. But turning
our backs on our treasured 50-year
legacy of providing public school
higher education access might not
have to happen, at least until Har-
risburg deﬁnitively decides to twist
the budgetary knife. Considering
what the University stands to lose
by completely privatizing, adminis-
trators should jump at any method
that helps Pitt retain quasi—public
status — even if that method, on
different grounds, sounds tough to
swallow. That is, Pitt should open its
books, once and for all. Y

Hypothetically, if state appro-
priations dwindle to effectively
zero, Pitt’s tuition could experi-
ence dramatic jolts upward, con-
ceivably reaching the $40,000 per-
year mark similarly sized private
institutions often charge. From the

‘educational idealist’s perspective,

such a result would be disastrous.
For many years, Pitt has reﬁned its
reputation as a “Best Value” uni-
versity, which means it has grown
to deliver the quality education of
an expensive private school at a
fraction of the price. According to
a2011 press release from Chancel-

lor Nordenberg, Pitt has been able

to provide Pennsylvanians with_

valuable, affordable higher educa-
tion in large part because of state
support.

Without it, Pitt could relinquish
its meritorious function of bringing
opportunity to students with emp-
tier pockets, asvstudies show that
tuition increases can disproportion-
ately affect the college decisions of
low—income students. Unless Pitt
magically ties rising tuition with ris-

ing instructional quality, an incom- ,
a ing price barrier to a Pitt education

should not be taken lightly — it will
either exclude students we want to
serve or force them into untenable
debt contracts. Thus, we may not
like where this drift toward priva-
tism, driven by appropriation cuts,
takes us.

If Pitt prefers to guard our “Best
Value” reputation — and Norden-
berg has made this preference clear
—— then it must not let go of state
dollars. And if Gov. Corbett con-
tinues to de—prioritize higher edu-
cation tomorrow, Pitt needs to do
something more proactive. Here’s
an idea — offering to abide by the
Right-to—Know Law. '

Now Pitt’s secrecy—to—transpar—
ency ratio might strike you as ir-
relevant to state funding decisions,
but as of recently, it’s completely
relevant. After the Sandusky in-
vestigation at Penn State, in which

With the media abuzz with news of
primaries, caucuses and the presi-
dency, it’s hard to escape political
talk. Maybe this isn’ta problem if
you keep up with politics, but a lot
of us just don’t do that —— especially
since we won’t have The New York
Times or USA Today back on cam-

, pus until March. So it’s inevitable
. that, at some point soon, those of

us with poor political knowledge
will enter into a conversation and
not know how to react. ‘

‘To ready my readers for this
scenario, I’ve compiled a few op-
tions after which you can model
your own pseudo—political inter-
actions.

Option 1: Run away.

This is the easiest -strategy. If
someone engages you in a conver-
sation about politics, just turn and
run. Get out of there like someone
just shouted “Cops!” at a party.
Maybe you could provide an excuse
before you leave like, “Oh, I’m late
for class,” but this isn’t necessary.
You can make excuses later. just
run. This option is foolproof.

Option 2: Create a
distraction.

Much like the ﬁrst option, this
requires no actual knowledge of
politics. As soon as you hear some-
one say “Newt Gingrich” or “Mitt
Romney,” quickly create a distrac-
tion that will force your conversa-
tion partner to lose interest in this
abhorrent subject. _ .

If you’re walking together, try

tripping them. Other possible
ideas include pointing out a cute
boy or girl, succumbing to an un-
stoppable coughing ﬁt or punch-
ing a stranger. You could also take
a cue from Katlstratford in “1o
Things I Hate About You” and lift
up your shirt. Works every time.
Before you know it, you’ll be far
away from the topic of politics and

safely in the realm of explaining‘

your erratic behavior. '

Option 3:;),Drop key phrases
and facts. . V. -.

This strategy could backﬁre
if you’re pressed for more infor-
mation, but it’s a risk you’ll have
to take. You coulddalways start
along these lines .and change
track midco_nversation if it gets
too intense. _ .

' For this method, you need to

' memorize a couple phrases» or
facts. If someone asks about your 
political views,.feed her the classic,

“I’m ﬁscally moderate but socially
liberal.” If someone wants to talk

' to you about the primaries, men-

tion that"really awful Rick Perry
video that everyone saw. If some-

i one mentions the presidency,

complain about how the popular
vote doesn’t really mean anything.
Then you can segue into how Bush
was a total lame-o. just steer clear
of speciﬁcs. ' .
For a general save-all, become

_ really familiar with just one pol-

itics—related area. For example,
pick one — preferably obscure
-— bill to follow and talk about
it whenever politics comes up. A
friend of mine knows a. lot about
the ban.on horse slaughter but
little else. -
You could also obsess over the

for surviving political conversations

If you’re worried about betraying a lack of political expertise, consider Sarah Reagle’s ‘advice

with Maurice Sendak on ‘The Col-
bert Report’? He’s hilarious.”
This is ideal because you’ll
effectively change the subject,
and the person will assume you '

-As with partly

  watched the whole episode and .
_ I ' are therefore in the know about
pcoﬂversa-tlon’ all things political. It’s a win—win

situation. This also works with
segments from “The Daily Show
with Jon Stewart.’.’- _
Another great subjectchanger
is cute animals. Start talking about
_ thatvideo of otters holding hands
, or about the clip’ of Kristenpell on
. -» ’ -- — V  ; “Ellen” where her heart me ts into
  ' a puddle over sloths. Better yet,

you can always
save yourself g
by abmpilv , 

-, Option 5: Learn about l
life ofla particular president. Try‘ politics.-

James Buchanan. He’s the only

president from Pennsylvania and

the only one to remain a lifelong A

bachelor. He’s also considered one

«of the worst presidents, so there

shouldn’t be too much to talk about
in terms of actual_ politics.

Option 4: Changethe .
subject. '

As with any ‘uncomfortable
conversation, you can always save
yourself by abruptlychanging the
subject. To make the change a little
subtler, try relating it in some way
to a vaguely political subject.

For example, change the topic
to a “Colbert Report” clip you saw
recently (which wasn’t actually

Another option is ‘actually to
learn about -politics. This might
seem daunting, but you can do it.
All you need to do is’ Watch one

full episode of both “The Colbert‘

Report” and “The Daily Show with
Jon Stewart” per week. Equipped
with this expertise, you’ll be able
to speak with authority on_ any-
thing in the political realm. So if

‘you’re up to thisintellectual com-

mitment, go forth, my big-brained
friend.

With these options, I hope you
can successfullynavigate these try-
ing times before the next presiden-
tial election, when the country will
collectively forget about politics
for another four-years. Good luck,

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Pitt’s Dante Taylor (left) scored nine points and grabbed ﬁve rebounds while point guard Travon Woodall (right) scored 29 points

  Pitt Continues to fight back from 0-7 start '£n‘Bt'g East play

By Sean Corra:do_
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt men’s'basketball team
started the Big East season with
a seven-game losing_streak, but
with point guard Travon Wood-
all healthy and back on the ﬂoor,
the Panthers have now won four
straight games. ’

, Wooda1l’s career-high 29-point 4
effort led the Panthers to a 79-70

victory over Villanova at the Pe-

tersen Events Center on Sunday,_

and his teammates seem to know
what a difference he makes.

, “It’s great to have Tray back,”
shooting guard Ashton Gibbs —
who added 25 points of his own
against the Wildcats — said with
a smile. ’

Pitt was unable to penetrate the
Villanova deﬁense early, turning the
ball over seven times in the ﬁrst 12
minutes, and the Wildcats jumped
out to a 19-14 lead after guardjames

  SPORTSP

Bell drained back-to—back 3-point-
ers. '

To recover from Villanova’s run,
Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon took
the Panthers’ ﬁrst timeout with
eight minutes to go in the ﬁrst half,
and P_itt’s offense began to roll due
to solid outside shooting from its
two starting guards.

“Gibbs and Woodall controlled
_the entiregame,” Villanova head
coach Jay Wright said. “There
was nothing we could do about it.
They’re just great.”

With~Pitt trailing 21-16 and 7:04
left in the half, Woodall-— who hit
all 12 of his free throw attempts —

e ‘ made two consecutive 3—pointers to

give the Panthers a 22-21 lead that
they didn’t give up for the remain-
der of the game.

Fueled by the momentum, Gibbs
scored 11. points in the ﬁrst half
after the timeout. He hit a pair of
3—pointers to give him the all—time

Pitt career mark in 3-point ﬁeld ‘

goals attempted with 349. ‘G

 

Gibbs’ lone assist in the game
was sent down low to Dante, Taylor,
who slammed it down on a 3-point
play with 2:19 left in the half. The
play highlighted Pitt’s 22-2 ﬁrst-half
run and extended the Panthers’ lead
to 15 points, 38-23.

Taylor followed up a strong per-
formance against West Virginia with
nine points and ﬁve rebounds.

Pitt’s lead grew as high as 17
points early in the second half, but
Maalik Wayns responded by lead-
ing a 9-0 Wildcats scoring run that
trimmed Pitt’s 45-28 advantage to
49-40» ’

Villanova began chipping its way
back into the game, coming within
three points with less than a min-
ute to play. The Panthers 27-of-31
performance at the foul line helped
them keep the lead.

“We lost a lot of games due to
free throws.” Gibbs. said. “It’s all
about guys getting in the gym and
bringing it to the game.”

Dixon added that free throw suc-

cess often stems from getting the
best foul shooters to the line. Gibbs
and Woodall combined to shoot a
perfect 19-19.

Although Wayns ended the game
with 18 points on 22 ﬁeld goal at-
tempts, it wasn’t enough to brush
off the Panthers’ consistent scoring.
Wayns missed an open chance to tie
the game beyond the arc with less
than thirty seconds remaining.

“We wanted to keep him off the
line,” Dixon said of Wayns’ scor-
ing ability. “For the most part, we
guarded him very well.”,

Woodall’s lay-up off a full court
heave from Nasir Robinson with
20 seconds remaining sealed the
victory for Pitt.

The Wildcats will hope for a re-
bound performance as they head
back home to face Providence at 8
p.m. Tuesday night. Pitt will look

“My victory helped me gain confidence,”
Mack said. “We’re all really excited to have
the opportunity to win the EWL three years
in a row. It’s something that we have "been

Pitt to join CoastalDivisionof ACC.

Sports Editor

Pitt doesn’t necessarily know when it will start

playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference, but V
now the Panthers know where.

The ACC announced on Friday that Pitt
will join the Coastal Division of the confer-

ence while Syracuse will join the Atlantic l5i- .

vision. .
_The Coastal Division consists of Virginia

J Tech, Virginia, Georgia Tech, Miami, Duke
and North Carolina. Syracuse will play in the 5
. Atlantic Division with Boston College, Clem-

son, Florida State, Maryland, North Carolina
State and Wake Forest.‘

. “We have been engaged in discussions on
the various options for integrating Pitt and.
Syracuse since’ early f ,” ACC commission-'
er John‘Swofforc_l said in a statement. “It’s a
tremendous tribute to the leadership at our

schools thatwe will be able to se_amlessly add v

Pitt and Syracuse at the appropriate time when

. they become full playing members.” .

Under Big East Conference rules, Pitt and

. Syracuse can’t join the ACC for 27 months after

notifying the Big East of their departure. How-
ever, if West'Virginia wins its lawsuit against
the Big East to leave early, it couldhave impli-
cations for Pitt and Syracuse’s exit. V

Pitt athletic director Steve Pederson told
the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette that he’s “very

Virginia situation” and wouldn’t eliminate .

the chance that the Panthers could enter the
ACC_by 2012. 5

Pitt and Syracuse will become primary
crossover partners forfootball, meaning that

. the Panthers will play. all six teams in their

division and Syracuse every year. Pitt will also
play two rotating opponents from the Atlantic
Division each -season. V _

‘ The ACC will play an 18—game conference
schedule in basketball starting in the 2012-
2013 season. Once Pitt and Syracuse enter

the conference, each school will also have a ~

primary partner for basketball. Pitt is matched

up with Maryland while Syracuseis ‘partnered.

with Boston College.
The basketball schedule will be set up in

~ a three—year cycle. Pitt will play every league

opponentat least once while playing Maryland
home and away armually. The other 12 teams
will rotate in groups of four. The Panthers
will face a given team one year both home
and away,’ one year at home only and one year
away only. -

For Olympic sports, all teams will play each
other at least once during the regular season
with the exception of baseball. The ACC will

also add an championship for gymnastics. With‘

Pitt joining, the ACC will have four gymnastics

programs —— the number the league’s bylaws I

require for a conference championship. I

Former Panthersielecftedito Hall of Fame

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Former Pitt’ football players Chris Doleman
and Curtis Martin were named to the Pro Foot-

" ball Hall of Fame Class of 2012 on Saturday.

Doleman, a Pitt defensive end from 1981
to 1984, played professional football for 15
years and is one of the NFL’s all—time leading
pass rushers. Curtis Martin was a running

t back at Pitt from 1991 to 1994 and played in

the NFL for 11 seasons. ' —

- Pitt now has eight Pro Football. Hall of
Fame players -— Doleman, Martin, offen-
sive lineman Russ Grimm, linebacker Rickey
Jackson, quarterback Dan Marino, running
back Tony Dorsett, tight end Mike Ditka and

- linebacker Joe Schmidt. The University is

tied for third nationally with Ohio'State and
Michigan. 1- _ -
’ Pitt trails Southern California (11) and

- Notre Dame (10). V

An eight—time Pro Bowler with the Min-
nesota Vikings, the Atlanta Falcons and San
Francisco 49ers, Doleman was a member of
the NFL’s All-Decade Team of the 19905. When
he retired in 1999, he was fourth in the NFL
all—time with 150.5 sacks.

The Vikings picked him fourth overall in

the 1985 NFL Draft. . _

He led the NFL with 21 sacks in 1989 -

the fourth—highest single-season total in NFL
history — and ﬁnished with 10 or more sacks
in eight seasons. '

“I thank my family. I’m blessed to have
the family that I have, to be able to play in
the National Football League, coming from
great parents,” Doleman said in a Pitt press
release. “There are so many things I can talk
about, great coaches along the way  guys
who have helped me become the man that I
am out there on the football ﬁeld —— and in
life. I am truly blessed to be in this position
and very honored.”

The New England Patriots drafted Martin
in the third round in 1995. He was a member of
the Patriots from 1995 to 1996 and then joined
the New Yorkjets from 1998 to 2006.

Martin is fourth all-time in the NFL with

14,101 rushing yards and has played in ﬁve Pro -

Bowls. He ﬁnished with 2,643 career rushing

_ yards at Pitt but only played in two games

during the 1994 season because of an ankle

V injury. In the 1994 season opener, Martin ran

for 251 yards and set a Big East single—game
rushing record.

“The way I feel about this, it’s probably ‘
the most humbling feeling that I’ve had in.

my entire career,” Martin said in a Pitt press
release. ‘fI.feel tremendously grateful for all
of the players that I’ve played with and all of
the coaches that have _coached me and been
part of my entire career.” . l

25.5 percent for the game and 13.3 percent
from 3-point range.

Freshman Arlesia Morse led'Marquette

Panthers never gained the lead again.

Pitt turned the ball over 22 times, but
stole it back a season-high 15, times.

Marquette —— averaging the most turn-
overs in the conference (21.1 per game) --
turned the ball over 24 times. But the extra
chances didn’t help the Panthers.

After goingirito the half down 36-25, Pitt
wouldn’t come any closerthan 10 points for
the rest of the game. ,

As has been the norm in conference play

if for the Panthers, Marquette went on a 12-0

run out of the break to further its lead while
Pitt struggled offensively. ‘-

The Golden Eagles exposed Pitt in tran-
sition, scoring 18'fast break points to Pitt’s
two. ' e
Pitt’s next game isn’t until next Saturday,
giving the young team time to regroup be-
