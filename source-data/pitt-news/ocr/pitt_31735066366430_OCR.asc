The University Police will soon
provide daily coverage around
the clock at the Towers, Schen-
ley Quadrangle, and the Student
Union, according to Dr. David

Kurtzmann, vice-chancellor of ﬁ-
nance.

Presently, full security
coverage is available only on
weekends. L

“We haven’t worked out the
details,” Dr. Kurtzman continued,
“but we have notiﬁed Mr. Fisher
(director of physical plant) who
feels that he can do it.in a few
days. It is a matter of getting
the necessary personnel.-3’ He es-
timated that the total manpower
required would be ﬁve men.

“The "move was made because
of the analysis of ‘the problem
and indications given by students.
The decision was based on need

and had no relationship to the
allocation bill passed by the State

Legislature. We had pretty much,

made our decision Monday morn-
ing,” Kurtzman said. See story
on this page.)

The ﬁrst hint of an increase in
security was given by Vice-Chan-
cellor of Student Affairs Helen
P. Rush at the ﬁrst Towers-Quad-
rangle Committee meeting Wed-
nesday.

The need for increased secur-
ity has been voiced by Men's
Dormitory Council (MDC) and
the senior and graduate assistants
on‘ the women’s ﬂoors in Tower
C. A recent letter -to The Pitt
News by Joan Granowitz, reveal-
ing a number of thefts on grad-
uate ﬂoors, also called attention
to the problem. » ‘

The Towers-Quadrangle Com-
mittee, set up by Miss Rush, is to

consider problems arising in semi-
public areas of the Quadrangle,
Towers, and Student Union. Such
areas would include the Towers
Lobby and lounges in the other
buildings. “The -Committee will
not infringe upon the rights of
MDC and Women’s Housing
Board,” Miss Rush said.

The group discussed the use
of the Towers" lobby by student
groups and agreed with the re-
cent lobby policies passed by

‘MDC. Only several minor revi-

sions were made. Future meet-
ings will be called as problems
arise. The committee will be “in-
ﬂuential if and when we build
new dormitories,” according to
Savina Skewis, dean of women.

The committee, chaired by Miss
Rush, includes“ administration,

faculty, and student members.

Students Write Letter to President
"“ To Show Support for American
Servicemen In Vietnam  

' By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

A letter affirming student sup-
port for the servicemen in Viet-
nam was sent to President‘ Lyn-
don B. Johnson last week by the
Ad Hoc Committee to Express
Support for Our Men in Vietnam.
The letter was signed by Pete
Morgan, Bill Lerach, Jim Smith,
and Marty Engels.

Included in the letter was the

declaration on the recently-cir-'

culated petition which urged the
Student Government (SG) to
“honor” the efforts of the Amer-
ican servicemen in Vietnam. Over

§L.3,800 people signed the petition

in two days. Also mention was
the Oct. 27 rally, where “over 1,-
800 people attended to reaffirm”
the principles outlined in the
petition.

Commenting on the effects of
the petition and rally sponsored
by the Ad Hoc Committee, SG
Senator Marty Engels declared,

“Our effort accomplished two
basic things: it showed our troops
in Vietnam that an overwhelm-
ing majority of our students re-
spect them for serving their
country and do not consider them
dupes, and, more- importantly, it
showed that the majority in this
school can beﬂvocal.”

Pete Morgan‘ added, “Now that
the rally has taken place, I can’t
walk down the hall without some-
one coming up to me and de-

‘manding that I defend U.S. po-s

‘licy in Vietnam. These people
fail to real that that wasn’t the
purpose of the rally and that we
are not McGeorge -Bunday’s par-

- tisans at the Pitt campus.”

Charles Hollander, vice «chair-
man of the Pitt Progressive Par-
ty agreed with the action of the
Ad Hoc ‘Committee in sending
the letter to the President of the
United States. “I think this is
what they should have done in
the ﬁrst place,” he said. “The

concept behind the petition was
a good idea, and I am only
sorry that the intentions of the
Ad Hoc Committee were mis-
understood.” , '

The letter read, in part: “The
recent draft card burning and
other unpatriotic acts on the part
of a small minority of .college

students throughout ‘the country ‘

triggered a reaction at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. We stu-
dents’ wanted to show the true
feelings of the academic com-
munity; we wanted to show that
we have a deep respect for‘our‘
country and its ﬁghting men;
most importantly, we wanted to
show the GI’s in“Vietnam we are
behind them.” —

After summarizing the efforts

A at the University in support of

American servicemen, "it con-
cluded; “The students at Pitt
have spoken. Please pass on this
moral support to our troops in

Legislature Grants

- (See Editorial, Page 5)
By BILL CABIN

The Pennsylvania State Legislature passed a bill »this'
' week, giving the University a $10,847,423 grant; The bill‘, ,
now awaits the signature of Governor William Scranton. ' i

s “We get an allocation from the stateevery year which-
makes us a state-aided institution,” said Vice-Chancellor o _,
Finance Edgar Cale. “Normally it is $5,847,423, but because

ceived the extra $5 million.‘
The bill allocates money for

use in “operation of the Univer-

sity,” said Cale. Usage includes:

$9,428,423 for general maintain- a

ence; $1,291,000 for the medical
school; $98,000 for the Graduate
School of Library Science; and
$30,000 for the Jonas Salk Pro-
fessorship in the medical school.

“The only money from the
grant which we must return to
the state is $2.5 million from the
general maintainence area,” said
Cale. “When "we requested an
emergency allocation of $5 mil-
lion in June the stated gna-nted
us a- $2.5 million loan. The loan
included the stipulation that it
be repaid from our regular’ allo-
cation.”

With the grant of $2.5 million
this spring and the $5 million
this week, the University has ré-
ceived a total of $7.5 million ad-

”ditional from the state. The Uni-

versity must pay back only $2.5
million. “‘We are getting a net
gain of $5 million,” said’Cale.
The bulk of the grant will ap-
ply to . general maintainence.
“General maintainence applies to
anything done by the Universi-
ty,” said Cale. “For example, fac-
ulty salaries would be in this
category, but it could not be used
to pay debts or for endowment.”

cellor for ﬁnance, also said the

Israel Scheffler Speaks

On Objective Science

By SUZAN and JOSEPH DIVACK .
Presenting the question ‘Is Science Objective,’ Dr. Israel
Scheffler of Harvard University used evidence fromthe his-
tory and epistemology (knowledge theory) of. science to jus-
_ tifyr his belief in the essential objectivity of science.
As guest speaker at the Philosophy of Science lecture
series he distinguished between the origin and the evalua-

tion of scientiﬁc development and
the nature of progress in this
development. He employed the
discussion of knowledge th€0I'y

A given by Hans Reichenbach, for-

mer professor of philosophy at‘
the University of California, as a
context of justiﬁcation for sci-

* ence.

Citing a monograph of the his-
torian of science, Kuhn, he stated
that scientiﬁc progess was of
the form of revelation, not slow
contemplative deliberation resolv-
able by proof. One of the stan-
dard viewpoints about scientiﬁc
objectivity is that it is both the
beginning and the end of exper-
ience. Professor Scheffler attack-
ed this position with a set of.
arguments stemming from his-
tory of science.

In analyzing the concept of
knowledge theory.as it relates to
science Professor Scheffler util-
ized the views held by Reichen-
hach who regarded epistemology

. as the internal structure of know-

ledge to be contrasted with those
disciplines which deal with the
external structure of knowledge,
such as Sociology.

He further pointed out the dif-
ferentiation between psychology
and epistemology. The former
deals with the actual concepts of

. thought in action whereas the
0’ latter is in a process of devising ‘

the correct concepts to recon-
struct pre-established knowledge.

 It is the function of knowledge

theory’ both to describe and to
criticize. The significance of ep'is-'
temology for science is its poten-
tial to uphold objectivity’ as an

' sevaluative function.

Kuhn’s theory by dividing sci-
entiﬁc activity into two types,
normal and revolutionary, pre-
sented one idea about scientiﬁc

f[,,objectivity. He regarded routine

experiments and recapitulation
of old theories as normal science.
Analogous to this is an acrostic
where one knows that there is a

 solution to be obtained.

While following the path of
“normal” scientiﬁc experimenta-
tion one may encounter an ano-

maly—a problem which does not '

seek out a solution by any of the
available and tested methods.
‘The scientist is hereby confront-
ed. with what Kuhn terms the

. crisis. He need not give up his

traditional theoretical model at

‘ this point, but he should (a) take
"a different view toward it, and
. ‘ (b) turn toward a new model.

' This turning is the second type
of scientiﬁc endeavor, revolution-
ary science. It is of the utmost

importance to take cognizance of
the fact that this “turning” oc-
curs relatively suddenly. Like the
Gestalt perceptual switch, it must
occur all at once or not at all. It
is the type of insight of which
an upholder could not logically
convince a disbeliever.

After responding to this revol-
ution, the scientist is in a sense
working in a different world. The
physicist, Planck, pointed out
that the change of view in a
community of thinkers comes not
from a universally agreed refuta-
tion of the older view but from
the fact that those upholding the
old view die or become disinter-
ested.

With great respect for the con-
tribution of Kuhn’s argument, Dr.
Scheffler does at this point, how-
ever, take issue with it. He stated

“schools” each having experi-
enced such a sudden conversion
in ideas are imbedded each with-
in its own theoretical model and
cannot communicate from this
vantage point nor can there be
translatability of one model into
the other.

This stems ‘from an initial pro_b-
lem . . that these paradigms,
the theoretical models, are set
in different conceptual cages
viewing different worlds.

Professor Scheffler was not at
all denying that science is ob-
jective. He was denying that
there are ready made objective
methods and solutions which are
guaranteed’ to yield truth about
the external world.

that contemporaneous scientific

By WILLIAM R. JEROME
The theme of “appearance ver-
sus reality” is neither new nor
revolutionary, Shakespeare’s

,plays- and sonnets are ﬁlled with

images involving the sense of
sight, the complexion, ill—ﬁtting
clothing, and the theatre. And
more than one philosopher has
dealt with the concept of our
senses and sense-data as being
our only link with reality, if a
real world apart from our senses
exists at all. '

Edward A1bee’s Tiny Alice ap-
plies th e appearance - reality
theme to examine sex, religion,
and life in general; he adapts
this theme to‘ the theatre by
creating a play dealing with se-
mantics and the senses. And the
American Conservatory Theatre

' (ACT) production of Tiny Alice

at the Playhouse is a sensuous,
sensual, and often‘ sizzling pre-
sentation as it rips apart man’s
conception of belief and under-
standing.

The play centers around only
ﬁve characters: a Lawyer, a Car-
dinal, a lay brother, a Butler,
and Miss Alice. The Lawyer in-
forms the Cardinal that his mo-
ther (Miss Alice) wants to give
the church 100 million dollars a
year, for 20 years. The Cardinal
then sends the lay brother Ju-
lian, to the Lawyer’s mansion to
meet Miss Alice and to make

arrangements for receiving the ‘

money.

Julian, who had spent six
years in an asylum, is an ideal-

_ ist wanting to become a servant

of God. He had been confused
over the distinction between God
the Creator and God, “the pup-
pet invented by man.” In this re-
gard he is a ﬁgure of mobility,
for his questioning nature places
him between Alice and the Law-
yer — who “never confuse be-

tween the representative. of a
thing and the thing itself” —— and
the Cardinal —— who is apparent-
ly less concerned with God than
with the symbols of God» This, at
any rate, is how Albee has set
up his characters.

To achieve this, the play is
full of semantic twists, and the
ACT production brings them off

sparklingly, often with satiric “

wit. Thus the Lairvyer chides the
Cardinal for referring to himself
' and the church as “we.” And the
Butler is introduced to Julian as
“Butler,” for why does he need
a name other than the word that
denotes what he really is?

There are other, more impor-
tant questions in the play. Re-
garding religion and sex, we are
left with the frightening concept
that we can never truly know
their substance, only their sym-
bols. We thus are truly unable
to love or understand anything
because all We know of it is what
we gain through our senses. And
in all three acts we see Julian
ﬁnding this out, in scenes whose
tension is virtually tactile.

 

At the end of Act 1, Julian ver-
bally represents the consumma-
tion of love in a scene that ap-
proaches theatrical consumma-
tion. The words, the actions, the
music and sound effects merge
to create. a scene of unforgettable
emotion. This is also true of the
ﬁnal scene of Act II, in which
the concept of martyrdom is ex- 
amined, and in the last scene
of the play, where Julian is left
with the. models and masks of
life while life itself eludes him.

Tiny Alice is not very tiny. It
is a cosmic look at the appear-
ance-reality relationship, parti-
cularly as it concerns sex and
religion. The Playhouse company
has brought about a briliant the-
atrical event, with a brilliant
cast, Paul Shenar as Julian, Ray ~—"
Reinhart’.as the Lawyer, DeAnn
Mears subbing for Ludi Claire as
Miss Alice, “Scooter” Teague as
Butler, and Harry Frazier as the
Cardinal all deserve equal and
lavish praise in providing an of-
ten but totally fresh evening.

Resignation of Four Causes

Future Study of ‘The Duke’

The resignation of four mem-
bers of the editorial board of the
Duquesne University student
newspaper, The Duke, has not
brought about changes in the op-
eration of the campus newspa-
per, according to C. S. McCarthy,
chairman of the journalism de-
partment.

He said that it is still not cer-
tain that the Duquesne Duke will

operate completely outside the

journalism department next fall.
At present, the Duke serves as a
laboratory for journalism stu-
dents, although non-journalism
students may join the staff.

The future of the paper has

been under intensive study since
last month, when the four stu-
dents resigned. .

Dr. Kenneth J. Duﬁy, coordi-

nator of special activities at Du-

quesne, said there will be three
major changes in Duke opera-
tions. The paper will not serve
as a journalism laboratory, edi-
tors will be chosen by their fel-
low staff members.

See the new '66 Chevrolet, Chevelle, Chevy 11, Corvair and Corvette at your Chevrolet dealer's

396 y Chevrolet

Equipped with a
Turbo-Jet 396 V8,
special suspension
and red ‘stripe tires.

These cars weren't meant for
the driver who is willing to
settle for frills.

They're engineered from
the chassis on up as no-com-
promise road machines.

Standard output of the new
Turbo-Jet 396 V8—which
powers both models-éis 325
hp. This remarkably eﬂicient
power plant is also available
in a 360-hp version.

So much for what happens
on straightaways. How about
curves? You ride on a special
SS 396 chassis——with ﬂat-
cornering suspension and
Wide-base wheels.

A fully synchronized 3-
speed transmission is stand-
ard. Or you can order a 4-
speed or Powerglide-—also'
Strato-bucket front seats,
center console and full in-
strumentation. .

Sound like a car youcould
get serious over? That, as
you’ll see at your dealer’s, is
precisely how Chevrolet en-
gineers planned it. Seriously.

  Homecoming
 Labeled Fiasco

'Editor,,The Pitt News:

' As‘ a junior here at the Uni-
versity, I have gone through
Vfthree Homecomings and this last
 one was certainly a disgrace —
ef’ one which I would like to forget.
 71 can understand the fact that
' the budget was limited, but un-
'der the circumstances it would
-have been better to ‘limit the
week-end to one worthwhile
night rather than to extend the
‘agony over two worthless nights.

Every cent (or more appropri-
ately dollar) I spent on the ticket
_was wasted. For those who were
-- unable to attend the Friday night
performance, it was outrageous
to charge them over five dollars
for that dance in the Commons
Room.

I hope that next year the
alumni can come “home” to
something better. I, for one,
would not come back for a ﬁas-

Graduates Begin
Own Association

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is clear anyone who is »fami- ~

liar with the University campus
that there ‘is no organization
which adequately represents the
graduate students in campus af-
fairs. Moreover, the amount of
contact between graduate, stu-
dents in different departments,

as well as among those in a sin- '

gle department, often leaves
much to be desired so far as a.
healthy and stimulating intellec-
tual life is concerned. It is to
remedy both of these defects that
we, the undersigned, have taken
it upon ourselves to form a grad-
uate student organization.

What functions might such an
organization serve? The answers
to that question are _as myriad as
the number of graduate students
at the -University. Library hours,
for example, furnish a grievance
sorely felt by many; others among
us are interested in an investiga-
tion of bookstore policies, with
an eye to lowering prices for
undergraduates and ‘graduates.
alike, and to broadening the
range of periodicals available.
Graduate students living in the
dormitories are subjected to
petty restrictions from which
even‘ some honors undergrad-
uates are immue; surely this, too,
is a legitimate area of concern
for us. Likewise it has been sug-
gested that, in our capacity as
present and potential educators,
we have a responsibility to in-
sure that intellectual freedom on
the campus is not extinguished
by pernicious administrative rul-
ings, such as those which place
very narrow restrictions on the
freedom to distribute literature
within the Towers.

In any event, the‘ proper fo-
cus for a graduate student asso-
ciation can only be decided by.

»A the g_raduate_ student themselves- —

For that reason,’ we ex'tend”an~_in-,

concerned with’ the calibre ‘of

see many of our fellow students
there. » ”

Editor, The Pitt News:

The recent ﬁasco which oc-
curred in New York City when
the University attempted to play
‘Syracuse in a game of football is
yet another chapter in Frank
Carver’s continuing, mismanage-
ment of the Department of Ath-
letics at this school.

This letter is not being written
to protest the ludicrous exhibi-
tion which the University dis-
played in Shea Stadium but to.
question the ‘feasibility of" play-
ing‘ in New York in the ﬁrstx
place, Dr. Carver, over the past
few seasons /has consistently ad-
vocated a policy’ of having just

five home games for football. In‘

the last four seasons, Dr. Carver
has brilliantly switched such at-
tractive ‘games as Pitt-Army, Pitt-

25,000 fans

this
will be treated next year to Dr.

 
  

Penn State, and Pitt-Syracuse to
either neutral sites or the stadi-

» urns of the opponents.

In a time of ﬁnancial crisis at
the University, Dr. Carver’s po-
licies .on scheduling have once
again proved to be a rather ex-

pensive joke. In 1962, the Pitt-

Army game’ Was played in New

 



:6

York City instead of Pitt S_tadi- ~ '

um. The game drew the ridicu-
lous crowd of‘1'5,000 which cost
the University in the neighbor-
hood of over 20,000 extra fans
for the‘ game. ’
Trying to compound this error,
Dr. Carver switched this year’s
Syracuse game from the home

' site to Shea Stadium. Dr. Car-
ver’s explanation was that Syra- --

cuse simply does not draw well
in Pittsburgh. This assumption
of Dr. Carver is entirely untrue
as this student has been at every
game between these two schools
in Pittsburgh between .1956 and
1963, except the game in 1959.
The game in that year drew only
for Homecoming.
However, in all other games the
attendance was consistently over

"2

40,000 as opposed to the meagergf,-_,e

crowd of only 24,500 at New
York this season.

The University student who
has . any interestin the state of
'schoo1’s athletic fortunes

Carverfs greatest achievement
when the Panthers play only

-four home games out of ten con-

tests. Such a situation is unheard
of for ‘any major college foot-
ball team.

It seems more readily appar-
ent than ever that Dr. Carver

has once again given the school 
more than adequate justiﬁcation
for terminating his services to ‘

the University and acquiring the

services of a capable and know-

ledgable athletic director.

I had just returned home from
one of those interminable Thurs-
 day night meetings I sometimes

observe and I was determined to
catch up on some reading before
I fell asleep. I started to glance
at a recent copy of The Pitt
News and attempted to read an
article. It told something about
how Miss Rush was explaining
to some organization ,,what_ it's
role was on campus. ‘ r -

I must have gotten about half
":6-‘~—way throughthe article and then
have dozed off.

Soon enough my dreaming took

me.out of the approaching frosts‘ ’
of November and into. the first .

bursts of spring we observe in
late February aand ‘early March.
But the scene I was observing. in
‘this dream_wasno place I been
before. [ ' ' .

It was an immense ‘courtroom; .

K where the judges \bench rose
- -_i_ﬁg~_t,wenty feet off the floor. There
were no observable walls and the’
floor seemed to be made up of
‘clouds. I now realized a judg-
ment was about to take place,
some sort of final judgment.

I saw that those gathered in
the 'crirninal’s‘box were not the
-least bit evil in appearance, but
looked much like the people I go
to school with" every day. The
judges were young men, the same
age as the criminals. For some

curious reason peers were about

-- to judge peers. ~
-ft, To the left of the immense ‘
judge’s bench was a platform on
which there were ‘three huge .
white thrones. Each had a name
plate on it: one for “brothers
and sisters”, —a ‘second f 0 r‘
A “fathers and mothers” and a
third for “rulers of the realm.”
These ' were ‘the chairs ‘of the
prosecutors. . 5 . " A

to promote self. «
Considering this was supposed
to be such a horrible crime, Iwas
surprised that neither*the judges.
or any of those in the gallery
were shocked to hear the accusa-
tion. They had been plagued by
this many times before. As I
listened to the prosecution I

i— found out that not all those en-

trusted with the Sacred Duties
were accused of this crime. While
they too, had blundered and fail-‘
ed to complete their tasks, it
’was not the opinion of the people

that they had put self before the ‘

Duties,‘ -
First the “brother” prosecutor

u arose._ “You-have used your Sac-

red . Duties "to fulfill your own
ego needs,” he exclaimed. ‘
You have carried out none of

_ the duties. At this time last year

‘those who had preceded you had
done .more than wecould have

- ever hoped for. You have wasted

time arguing, turning man a-
gainst-‘ man and producing such
dissonance that one refused to
work with the other.”

Then the prosecutor for the-

“fathers and mothers’? began his
case. He explained that the duties
of the accused were particularly '
great because they were the rep-.

’ resentatives of all the sons and

daughters._
.. .“If -anything was to be ac-

complished between us it was '

you who were going to have to
do ‘it. There was so much to be
done. Had we reasoned together,
all the road blocks in your grow-
ing process might have been re-
moved. , _

"You f freely gathered criticism
about us, and ‘published it.

covered yvhere the real problems
lay. As a combined force we
could have gone to the rulers of

Editor, The. Pitt News:

_While at work .tonight in our ,
radio carrier room, near the Bien
Hoa Air Base, I came across a
picture in the Paciﬁc Stars"and
Stripes of students of your Uni-
versity holding a demonstration
in support to us servicemen over
here in Vietnam. Let me tell you
for once I felt grand. In the back
of most of our minds we tend to
think our entire country and fel-
low Americans back us up. In
general, I suppose it's true.

But when certain groups cause
a big sting over the war it hurts,

deep down to, read it. Sure no

one likes war-. It is a .waste of
human. lives. However, the Viet

‘Cong ‘are ﬁghting for a. cause;

we are too, freedom never comes
at a low price. I've ‘seen what
these Viet Cong do to -people,
more so to Americans.'But what
must be done inspite of what I
or anyone else likes must be car-
ried out.

A Being engaged and here isn’t
good at all. I really feel sorry
for the men _I work with that are
married and have kids. Xmas
isn’t the same with daddy gone.

' Life as I know it just isn’t the

same. I hate being here, ‘how-
ever. I would rather.die for my
country than by any other means
outside of _a natural death. Only
God knows.

My object then in writing is

to express my personal thanks

i to your student body for their

support. Without it what's their

this the School of Liberal Arts
normally accepts only the cred-
its earned at the intermediate

level. of any language (except

Chinese or Russian where both
elementary and intermediate
credits may count) among the
minimum of 124 required for a

YOU, TOO, CAN BE INFERIOR ,

The second gravest problem confronting college students
today is inferiority feelings. (The ﬁrst gravest problem is,
of course, the ‘recent outbreak of -moult among sorority
house canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of infe-
riority feelings and their possible cures.

Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three princi-

pal categories:
1._ Physical inferiority.
2. (Mental inferiority.
3. Financial inferiority.

_ (A few say there is also a fourth category: ichthyological
inferiority_—a feeling that other people have prettier ﬁsh-
‘ but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in

the Great Lakes area.)

Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, per-
haps the easiest to understand. Naturally we are inclined
to feel inferior to the brawny football captain or the beauti-
ful homecoming queen. But we should not. Look at all the
people, neither brawny nor beautiful, who have made their
marks in the world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates;
Look at Caesar. ‘Look at Lassie. ’

What I,,mean is you can't always tell what’s inside a
package by looking at the outside. (Sometimes, of course,
you ‘.can. Take Personna Stainless Steel Blades, for exam-'
ple. Just"one glance at that jolly —blue and white package-

_ so bright and pert, so neat but not gaudy—and youknow it
g has to contain blades of absolute perfection. And you are

‘‘...when it
came to tying
granny knots.”

right! Personna gives you so many shaves per blade it takes
a math major to count them. And" they are luxury shaves-
smoother, comfortabler, kinder to the kisser. Moreover, .
Personna comes" both in Double Edge and Injector style.
And as if this weren’t enough, Personna isnow offering you
a chance to grab a ﬁstful of $100 bills from a $100,000 bowl!
The Personna Stainless Steel Sweepstakes is off and run-
ning, and you're all eligible to enter. Visit your friendly
Personna dealer today to get details and an entry blank.)
But I digress. Let-us turn now to the second category-
mental inferiority. A lot of people think they are dumber
than other people. This is not so. It must be remembered
that thererare diﬁerent kinds of intelligence. Take, for in-
stance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and
Sturbridge, students at a prominent Western university.
(Dartmouth). It was always assumed that Claude was the
more intelligent just because he knew more than Sturbridge
about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the humani-
ties, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, wasten
times smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny
knots. But no matter; everybody looked down on “Stupid
Sturbridge,” as they called him, and looked up to “Clever
Claude,” as they called him. But who do you think turned
out to be the smart one when theirgranny almost. got loose '
and ran away? You guessed it——good old Stupid Sturbridge.
We arrive now at the ﬁnal category, ﬁnancial inferiority.
One way to deal with this condition is to increase your in-
come. You can, for example, _become a fence. Or you can
pose for a life class, if your college is well heated. .
But a better way to handle ﬁnancial inferiority is to ac-
cept it philosophically. Look on the bright side of ‘poverty.
True, others may have more money than you have, but
look at all the things you--have that they don’t—debts, for

instance, and hunger cramps.

Always remember, dear friends,
grace. It is an error, but it is no disgrace.

  Being Frank

WHERE’S THE CHANGE, PLEASE

THE LINES are a little bit deeper in the foreheads of
Frank Carver and J-ohn Michelosen, the football coaches.
The lines are from worry and there are plenty reasons why

they should be there. Frank Carver hates to be humiliated,

John Michelosen hates to be humiliated, and the players
hate to be humiliated, but the opposition still seems to be

doing a good job. What's the reason?

Frank Carver isn’t smiling because he is receiving

phone calls and letters telling him what he already knows,

that something is wrong with Pitt football. John Michelosen
and his coaching staff aren't smiling because the fans and

even some alumni are screaming for their jobs.

“Yes, I’ve gotten phone calls and letters,” said Carver,

“but they are just repititions of ‘what I feel inside, myself.
I know that some changes are going to have to be made and

so does the Athletic Committee. »

CHANGES ARE necessary because Carver has been too

realistic in the past. He has adopted a P0110)’ Whldl 0011551‘

. tutes no redshirting and a murderous schedule: to go along
with the University’s high entrance requirements.

“I have nothing to do with the admissions standards,

but if I did I still wouldn’t want them changed,” said Car-

ver. “I don’t advocate red-shirting because a boy can get
through school in three years and why should we try and
keep him for ﬁve. As for a murderous schedule, all the major
independent schools play a schedule almost as tough, or as

tough as ours.”

“I know changes have to be made and we have been

looking into the possibility of hiring a man expressly for

recruiting. We have good contacts now with high school
coaches, but I,_,_th,i_nk the one man systemlwouldlkkbe more , .
’ effective.’’_ '

I

CARVER AND the Athletic Committee will have to
decide in favor of this motion if they hope to

ground for the talent in this area. I

gain any

“The system has ‘been successful at Penn State, added
Carver, and our poor showing last year indicates that there
is something wrong and that_ We didn’t_work hard enough.
It wasn't a great year for talent but we still didn’t get our

share, this year we have to.

Carver was non-cjommittal on changes in the ‘coaching
staff but he -didn’t deny them. “If we thought that a change
would be needed at anytime we would not hesitate to act.
Nobody is panicking up here and there is no reason why we

should. Of course we're down, but we’re not out.”

THERE ARE a couple of problems that Carver will
have to contend with if he doesn’t make some changes. Fan
support for Michelosen is almost nill and this means reduced
attendance. Football is the sport which supports all the
others and if attendance goes down so do sports at the Uni-
;.__¢/versity. A _ f e
' Also, if a boy is a senior in high school and a star half-
back, why would he come here? We’ve been losing the last
couple of seasons and the prospects don’t seem encouraging.
Who wants to go to a school with alosing tradition? “I

The sixteen freshmen foot-ballplayers show the coaches
couldn't sell area high» school stars on Pitt last year. If
there aren't’ any changes how will they be able to do it this
year. Other schools will be pointing to the fact that the

Panthers have been losing, and
switches.

they haven’t made any

“I KNOW other schools will be telling the boys that,”
said Carver, “but I think we have a good product to sell here
,”jf~.., at_ the University and we have to start doing a better job.
‘ We’ve got a lot to offer a boy -here and we have to start

showing it of .” .

The pressure is great at the Fitzgerald Field House

offices.

Pitt football is at a low point that hasn't been

touched since World War II. With no back door to athletes
as some of the Panthers’ opponents have, change is inevit-

able.

A course in logic isn’t needed by the Athletic Commit-
tee to see that a new type of recruiting system is needed
and some new faces should be around the Field House.

  FOR THESE REASONS a new man will bein charge of

USC Bases
  Strategy On
Mike Garrett

, By TOM SACKS

Notre Dame is the fourth ranked team
in the country. Southern California, tomor-
row’s opponent in Los Angeles, is ranked
fifth. This will be one weekend when the
football team won't be happy to see a
“ﬁfth.”

Coach John McKay, the founder of the “I” for-
mation several yearszback, will be sending teeth, ,
nails, guts and everything else against the Pan- ’
thers tomorrow in the body of All-America half-
back Mike Garrett. '

Garrett, the most likely choice to win the Heis-
man Trophy this year for the‘ best football player
in the country, has rushed for 962 yards in seven
games—an ‘average of 137.4 per game. He needs
a little over 400 yards in his remaining three games
to break the all-time NCAA three year rushing
markset by Ollie Matson nearly 15 years ago.

Even if the gridders are successful in contain-
ing Garrett, stopping him isn’t necessarily syno-

-nu—.—nn—-pqu1I.uu:;u——|u1u:-.

. nomous with stopping Southern Cal. Complement-’"

ing Garrett at the other halfback position is Rod
Sherman, rated by coach Walt Cummins as faster
than Garrett. ,

“Of course, you can’t drop your guard for a
moment on Garrett,” said Cummins. “But you
can’t overkey on him either or Sherman will break
your back. He’s often overlooked in comparison
but I think he’s just as dangerous.”_

Sherman has averaged six yards a carry ‘com-
pared with Garrett’s ﬁve per try thus far this
year. Sherman is also the second leading pass re-
ceiver on the Trojan team with 14 receptions \
worth 158 yards.

An agile, quick hitting offensive line has had,
with the. exception of Notre Dame, no trouble in
opening up holes for Garrett and Sherman. Given
the smallest opening the two backs can be counted
on to cover at least ﬁve; yards a carry, which is

their average. ' ~'

“They pick their holes real well. They're two
elusive backs that carry a threat to both the inside
and outside,” said Cummins. ‘ _

Except for a change in locale, the Panthers

7 will ﬁnd themselves in a situation almostidentical
sto that they had with Notre Dame. The Trojans

are a ball control team that likes to -grind out
the yardage. .

The Southern California quarterback, Troy
Winslow, has only attempted 83 passes, completing

. 47 for 532 yards. But in his own way he is just

as dangerous as either Garrett or Sherman.
In the 34-0 rout of Washington in the Trojans’

fourth game Winslow completed 11 of 11 passes.

He also has good speed, gaining 287 yards on 5'7
keepers. -

It’s a good bet that the Trojans will give the

I sorely pressed defense another working over to-

morrow..In desparation coach John Michelosen has
been experimenting with the unit, which has given
up 120 points in its past two games. This is twice
as many points as Southern California's defense
has yielded in seven games. .
Michelosen hinted that Sa.turday’s defensive
line-up is‘: likely to have a new appearance. Those
new faces have a good chance of popping up

anywhere‘ with the exception of‘ the safety and

middle linebacker positions’ occupied by Tippy
Pohl and Josh Novogratz, respectively. “We’ve
been weighing using, some boys both ways,” Mich-
elosen admitted. . . ' s

With the odds against them, the Panthers will
be going after their 400th victory tomorrow.

Team Maintains Stingy
Defense, Dogged Spirit

For Stadium Encounter
By GEORGE LIES __  

Bookmakers don’t give “lines” on so
lege soccer games, but if they did, they“ 
would find it hard to spot a team for spiri

into their game with Bucknell at Pitt S
dium at 1:30 p.m. ' 

-At the beginning of the season, coach,Leo
mis said this year’s soccer team it
will win if they sustained a team
effort. And they did, for in awhile.
Then injuries hit the team. This
resulted in a loss to West Chest-
er, 4-1, and a tie with Grove iCty.

NOW. the soccer team is over
that period of depression. They’ve
adjusted to the manpower short.
age and they’ve won five games
in a row. Although two games V
still remain on _their schedule, - ,.
they’re being considered for an NCAA tom-na.-.
ment ‘bid. , - '

Every victory so far has pointed out thatscl
Cer is a defensive game. Since the West Chester:
loss, the booters have scored just 12 goals, but
the opposition has managed only four. ‘ I "A

One reason for the tnv. R-T
through defense is that fullbacks have remained:
intact, nil from injuries. A second reason comes‘
in Bemis’ belief in defensive soccer. .

“A31 mil!!! in the fullback line would hurt
the most because there is where I put the :11
experienced players,” he said, “when you _ put
your best men in there, you can hold down the“
other team.” '

Bemis ranks this year’s fullback line of Jim;
Cuddy, Cal Bonawitz, and Art Richardson, ‘as the‘
best defensive unit in six years. '

Last year saw the soccer team as a second-
half season ﬂop. It was the year when Bemis
turned around and saw that he had players who_
could score a goal and so he thought offensively;
Then he lost Dave Reichenbach. . ‘ -1 S’

“Last year, the team lost Reichenbach, 3.fe1;,i
10W W110 they depended upon for scoring,” Bemis.
said. “Since the team felt that Dave had to score;
in order to win, there was a letdown. Losing ag-;
gravates everyone and last year there were probe;
ably some personality conﬂicts.”

This season though the soccer team shows
many different players scoring the few goals th ,_._
team has accumulated. The leader in goal-getting‘
department is senior Dave Shaffer with four. 
0nd to Shaffer comes Pete Snyder and Cal  7
witz, each with three. All of Bonawitz’s have bee
penalty kicks. - , s

As opposed to last season, this year’s -soccer-I
men don’t quit. “They know they’re going to get‘;
that goal and win,” Bemis said. “When Don Milil--5
lo was ejected from the Akron game, the fellows:
didn’t feel they could not win without him." ll

Bemis says he has a. lot of conﬁdence in taking‘:
this team to a. tournament, if they receive a l__>id*
“This team has the depth,” he said.’ “The only.
question mark_ is scoring." ‘ , L

Tomorrow Bucknell brings a team to the‘ Sta
dium turf which has nine of the players who?
were on the team that defeated the booters, 4.‘2,*:
last season. Besides that the Bison’s new head’
coach Mark—Randal1 has lots of material on hi 
bench. Practically every player went to a, good
prep school or a school which had a soccer team‘.:

‘:Bucknel1’s team is similar to that of Akron,"":
Bemis said. “On Saturday, we'll be facing the
same fellows, but not the same team because the-_ir=
new coach has really, built-up the team.” .. '

tion on the forward line.

By GEORGE LIES

Soccer halfbacks are the
real guts of a ball club. They
are the connectors between
the forward line and the de-
fensive fullbacks. If their
team is to win, they must
be good and they must run, and
run, and . . . I

S Out there on the ﬁeld, they're
a center of attraction in view
of everyone. If they make a mis-
take, everyone knows it. If they
make a spectacular play, every-
one knows it.

George Sommer proves this be-
cause he plays the center half-
back position. He makes specta-
cular plays, and he doesn’t make
many mistakes.

The player who plays the cen-
ter halfback spot must play a
split role. He must play half of-

fense and half defense. On de-T

fense, he covers up the holes
and picks up loose men. On of-
fense, he makes sure things stay
tight while feeding the ball to
the forward line.

“When I am out there in the
middle of the ﬁeld, I do what
I want,” Sommer said, “but I
can’t be overzealous and cover
the entire ﬁeld.”

Although Sommer runs around
at the center halfback position
like he lives there, he got his
start in soccer at an inside posi-

they were on a varsity team.
Sommer, one of 40 commuters in
the 640 boy school, tried intra-
mural tackle football, but de-
cided against that / because he
was a light-weight. Even when
he got to be six feet he weighed
only 140 pounds.

In his ﬁrst year of soccer, Som-
mer played on a line which con-
sisted of four foreign players.
All of them spoke Spanish, but
Sommer didn't.

“I never knew what they were
saying,” he said. “Everytime they
wanted to do something, they
would frantically wave their
arms, and yell, trying to tell me.”

‘After Lawrenceville, Sommer
came here. And the one goal he
had was to make the soccer team.
Even coach Leo Bemis could nev-
er forget the look of enthusiasm
on his face. “When I ﬁrst saw
him at orientation, he bubbled
over with eagerness. He thought
soccer was the greatest thing in
the world,” Bemis said.

Sommer has played a. “steady
game” for Bemis since coming
here, but in two previous seasons,

the soccer team had managed
only 5-5 records.

When Sommer went home dur-
ing the summer of those. two
years, he would have to listen to
all his friends who talked about
their soccer teams and their 9-1

records. This summer may be
different.

This year, Sommer is on a.

guts of the team will have some-
