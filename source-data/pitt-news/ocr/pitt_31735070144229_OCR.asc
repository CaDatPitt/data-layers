County unsure of drink tax's effects

by Kelly Thomas
Staff W/ritcr

Recent studies show that increas-
es in alcohol taxes can reduce the
number of alcohol—related deaths
in an area. But county ofﬁcials say
they’re not sure how these increases
would affect Pittsburgh.

A study published in the Ameri-
can Journal of Public Health found
that when Alaska raised its alcohol
taxes _in 1983 and 2002, its alcohol-
related deaths decreased by 29 and
11 percent, respectively.

The study did not include deaths
involving alcohol—related violence or
car accidents, but only alcohol-relat-
ed diseases such as alcohol poison-
ing, alcoholic liver disease, chronic
pancreatitis and cirrhosis.

Kevin Evanto, a spokesperson
for Allegheny County‘ chief execu-
tive Dan Onorato, said it was too

early to tell whether the 10 percent
drink tax Allegheny County put on
alcoholic beverages sold in bars and
restaurants last January would have

- the same effect.

“It’s the first year we’ve collected
[the tax] ,” said Evanto, “so we don’t
have anything to compare it to.”

Evanto said that while some
bars and restaurants have been
complaining that their business has
decreased, the tax  also brought
in more money for the county than
expected — $10 million more as of

' August A .

He added that because the tax
only affects restaurants and bars, it
would be hard to track whether it

state and raised them to rates higher
than the Allegheny County tax.

Pitt A senior David Ivankevich
turned 21 in January, when the tax
took effect So, he said he wasn’t sure
how it speciﬁcally affected him.

He did say, “The prices always
determine how much I drink.”

Alexander W/agenaar, the Univer-
sity of Florida professor who led the
study on Alaskan drink taxes, told
CNN he thought the taxes should
have the same effect throughout the
country. ’ I

“There’s no reason ‘to think the
experience in Alaska would be dif-
ferent than anywhere else,” said
Wagenaar. “Increasing alcohol taxes

had an impact; saves lives —— that’s the bottom

Morrison should keep

efforts   Pitt-centered

\V1th 1,063 votes to his name,
. Kevin Morrison won the Student
Government Board presiden-
tial election last Thursday. And
though he and the other candi-
dates who won might be relieved
for now, there’s work to be done
when they come into office next
semester.

During The Pitt News edito-
rial board’s interview with Morri-

son, and in his written campaign-

materials, it was clear that he in-
tends to take a proactive stance
on bringing SGB to the students,

«rather than forcing students and

groups to bring their issues to the
board.

According to his campaign
materials, one of his primary goals
is to form a student lobbying and
advocacy group comprising stu-
dents ﬁom Pitt, Carnegie Mellon,
Carlow, Duquesne and other local
schools in order to  student
and campus issues to the local
government ' -

While this is an admirable goal,
and one that could have a positive
effect on the student community
assuming it could be instituted
properly, it’s not clear" what issues
such a group could hope to solve.
Although the student bodies of
these respective universit:i_es are a
large part of the local economy,
students don’t vote as a group and
can’t be organized the way other
lobbying groups can — a fact
Morrison himself acknowledges.

Instead of to devote his
time and the school’s resources
toward an unreachable goal, Mor-
rison should remember to con-
centrate ﬁrst on his duties at Pitt.

For instance, there have been

I'1L1I'1'16fOI1S l1'lSt2I1CCS WhCtC Stl.1ClCf1lI ‘

groups have requested allocations
 “from SGB and had their
requests denied, often because of

some minor technicality in the

- rules. This simply shouldn’t stand,

especially when these same rules
are bent for other groups.

With -Morrison’s experience
and knowledge about the alloca-
tions process, hopefully instances
like this will decrease sharply.‘Not
only can he use his abilities to
smooth out situations that might
have been difficult before, but he
can‘ also educate groups and stu-
dents about how allocations work
and when it is and isn’t appropri-
ate to ask SGB for money.

SGB shouldn*t overhaul the
allocations process, because it
works for the most part. It just
needs to be attentive to the needs
of smaller groups, and the rules
should be clearer for when those
groups need money. _

Indeed, this sort of direct
interaction with students and
groups should be a. cornerstone
of Morn'son’s goals as SGB presi-
dent Many students now don’t
even know problems exist with
their allocations requests until af-
ter the request is made.

Morrison needs to make the
students advocates of their own

causes, both through like

referendums and surveys, and
also by staying in touch with stu-
dent groups and individuals rather
than simply trumpeting the same
few pet issuesthat SGB has been
concentrating on for years.
Morrison has said that he’s
dedicated to making SGB more
connected and involved with daily
student life at Pitt, and he seems

. to have a few good ideas for how

to do so. He justneeds to make
sure that they become a part of
his actual goals as SGB'president_
and not just empty campaign
promises. -

It's Pronounced "Lee"

by Lewis Lehe
Columrzidt

   
 
 

A man in New Jersey in 2005
ﬁled a suit against eHarmony.com
under New Jersey’s Law Against

Discrimination. His grievance:
A eHarmony discriminates against
gays by not arranging matches
between men and men or women

and women as it does between
women and men. ’ '
Last Wednesday, eHarmony
settled with the New. Jersey at-
torney general’s office. As part of
the settlement, the attorney gen-
eral required eHarmony to open
a matchmaking service for same-

sex couples. It’s called Compat- '

ible Partners.

Compatible Partners will al—.

most certainly be a titanic failure.
It is a business created from a
government mandate by an'unin-
terested company — a half-heart-
ed effort designed not to turn a
proﬁt, but just to look like a full-
hearted effort in the eyes of A law-
yers. Would anyone really try call-
ing their business something as
bland as “Compatible Partners?”

' It’s like if Royal Caribbean, were

called “Good Boat Rides.”

"Further, there is no appeal
to gays in a company that ex-
ists, as a matter of historical fact,
to. pander. It’s like when -a kid’s
mom ..who’s friends with your
mom makes him invite you to his
P3“Y- _

A reliable sign of Compatible
Partners‘ doom is that‘ Patrick
Perrine lauded the settlement.
He’s the founder and CEO .of
myParmer.com, which is like
eHarmony but for gay men. A
competent businessman like Per-
rine should never be very amped
about a new competitor. But as
he explains, “Our compatibility
system was designediby gay men
for gay men and would not work
for heterosexuals, or lesbians for
that matter. In the same way I
don’t expect eHarmony’s current
compatibility system to work for
same-sex daters.” _ _

Perrine’s comments matter for
two reasons:

First, as much as eHarmony
declined to enter the gay dating
market, the invisible hand mold-
ed a slew of other companies to
take the seat it neglected. MyPart-
ner.com is the extremely popular

king of that market, but has to '

November 24, 2008'

MCI Campus .

Government mandates man-dating

ﬁght off j Chemistry.com and oth-

er competitors eager to give gay '
couples better services for lower

prices.'
Second, Perrine unabashedly
declares his company is “by gay

-men for gay men.” .Under the

settlements precedent, why isn’t
that discrimination? He not only
neglects the straight majority,
but also the lesbian minority. To
absolve myPartner.com, or gay
male-speciﬁc cruise lines, music
labels, night-clubs and porn sites

is inconsistent.

The sentiment behind the
settlement, I believe, assumes
eHarmony is something called a
“general matchmaking service.”
MyPartner.com is a gay match-
making service —— _totally dif-
ferent!.— and it would be as ri-

. diculous to require them to offer
straight matchmaking as it would "
_to demand that Wendy’s does so.

A general matchmaking service
like eHarmony pairs up people
looking for long-term relation-
ships, regardless of sexual orien-
tation. “

Really, though, if I say eHar-
mony is a straight matchmaking

service, you  agree. It -just

It’s not a secret that on
of the bigger celebrities on cam-
pus. While my fame sometimes

im oses on In love life —- most 0
P Y

ladies are too intimidated by my
grandeur and gravitas -— it’s
something I have to accept re-
luctantly.

Like Superman, "however, I
have vowed to use my power only
for good. I will never use my
talents to inﬂuence your.sta_nces
subtly on truly important issues,
mostly because I’m ignorant on
theitruly important issues.

But with this ignorance comes
an unshakable conﬁdence in my
own infallibility as‘ well as-an un-
cluttered mind, which is why so
many of you come to me for ad-
vice every day. When one scared
individual asked me, “Ravi, with
ﬁnals and papers and projects
coming up, however shall I get

Finals stress? Here's

it all done?” I immediately came
up. with several easy ways to
carry through the soul-crushing
experience that is the end of the
semester and maybe, just maybe,

kick some academic ass while ,

doing it; I
1. Highlight every word you
. read. Some critics argue that
highlighting ought to be_ done
judiciously to, you know, high-
light relevant information. Once
again, the critics emerge as idiots.
It’s a proven fact that draining all
your highlighter ink on a single
page allows you to remember ev-
_ erything that is on it.

Plus, your squeaky highlighter
provides the perfect background
noise for everyone else annoyed
by silence in the library. Bonus:
‘If you stare at the hot pink long
enough, you might go blind and
be excused from your psych ﬁ-
nal." T — 4 P

2. Run in frontof cars when
crossing the street. Your time

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

during the dwindling days of
the semester is crucial, and you
'shouldn’t let a ton or two. of
hurtling metal get between your
academic exile at Hillman and
that cup of coffee at 7-11. Whﬂe
there is safety in invading Forbes

3 Avenue in numbers, why wait
for a crowd to organize? Heck,
why even look both ways? You’ll
probably -make it if you run
quickly enough. Bonus: Noth-
ing says, “I couldn’t ﬁnish my
programming assignment” like a

new prosthetic arm.

3. Print ‘an entire semes-

. ter’s worth of material at once.
Because you can’t, highlight a
computer monitor, you must
absolutely print out every docu-

ment your professor posted on‘

CourseWeb. God gave you 900
printouts a semester for a rea-
son, so go ahead and print one
page per PowerPoint slide. Yeah,

you could have printed judi- '-

ciously throughout the semes-

ter, but isn’t it fun watching the '
printer guy run back and forth
with stacks of colored paper

that bear your username? It’s like

having your own private helper
monkey.

In addition, your fellow stu-
dents will thank you for giving
them a study break as they wait
40 minutes for their term papers
to print out. ‘Bonus: Trees grow
back. ' ‘ i

4. Brag about your all—night-
ers. Seeing who stayed up longer
or who drank more Red Bull is
really the only way to measure
your academic performance.
Let’s face it, you have more ob-
ligations than just" schoolwork:

-_You have jobs, clubs and prom- ,
ises to friends. There’s no quicker

way to dump those responsibili-
ties than angrily recounting ex-
actly how many hours you were
up last night. '

It’s also a great way to demor-
alize students who managed their

some tips for studying success

time. They’ll be incapacitated by
jealousy of "your endurance. Bo-
nus: Also a great reason to be
mean to your friends; '

5. Blame everything on your
professors. You just couldn’t un-
derstand them sometimes, and
it’s not your fault there isn’t a
highly ‘extensive inter-network
computer web of some sort, or
some bound collection of pages
on a subject where you could
look stuff up on your own. Feel
conﬁdent in the knowledge that
sitting in the back of the lecture
hall is honestly the best effort
you could have put forth. Bonus:
Ofﬁce hours are a mythological
construct. ' V

6. Read my column. Because
greatness is, in fact, ‘contagious.
Bonus: It’s my column.

eHarmony,

Lehe, page 4

doesn’t say so outright. You can
tell it’s a straight matchmaking

service, however, because it only .

matches straight couples. Mean-

\ing is use. By forcing eHarmony

to offer gay matchmaking, the
government is actually forcing it
to become a different business,
which is a weird thinglfor a gov-
ernment to do.

It’s true that eHarmony could
offer gay matchmaking, but so
could Wendy’s. If we argue, ‘“But
eHarmony is a matchmaking ser-
vice, and Wendy’s is a hamburger

  Wen

shop,” we appeal to an invisible,’

platonic form of “general match-
making service” to which eHar-
mony just isn’t living up. It’s not
fulﬁlling its “essence,” whatever
that means, while Wendy’s can
fulﬁll its “hamburger shop” es-
sence without offering gay diat-
ing.

I think we mean it would be
easy and not ridiculous to force
eHarmony to become a general
matchmaking service. Wendy’s
would have a very hard time ‘of it,

and it’s silly‘ to imagine, ‘.‘COM- A

MITTED LIFE PARTNER,
FAN OF BAROQUE” spelled
but up there in white plastic on
the Wendy’s Value Menu. But
ease and the feeling that we are
really being quite sensible about
this whole affair doesn’t form a
base for mandate-in ‘an open soci-
ety like ours purports to be. .
eHarmony.com was found-
ed by an evangelical Christian
therapist named Dr. Neil ‘Clark
Warren. - Critics allege eHarmony
could have proﬁtably offered gay
matchmaking, but it didn’t be-

cause the company‘ has acloset

evangelical Christian ethos.

This claim is irrelevant. Again,
there’s implicit‘ recourse to a
f‘general matchmaking service”: I
doubt anyone supports requiring
-fupindarnentalist Christian match-
making services to offer same-
sex matching. But wevassume
eHarmony is not in that direc-
tion, because it is not marketed

that way. Is eHarmony really just

guilty of vagueness? What about
the mysterious BASF spots that
explain, “We don’t make a lot of

dy's shouldn't be forced to offer gay dating

the products you buy; we make a
lot of the products you buy bet-
ter”?”

The gay rights movement will

' do best if it affirms that the law

is not a knife for conservatives
to ‘etch a social vision. But the
movement loses legitimacy when
it steals the knife to "carve a com-
peting vision. Government and
liberty have rarely been compat-
ible partners.

Class is eating away into my
eating time. There is not enough
time to prepare and savor a home-
cooked meal. Gone are the rnid—
semester wasabi-encrusted tuna

steaks; in comes the pizza.

Oakland is home to more than
its fair share of pizza joints, but
Pizza Sola stands above the rest.
Closeted between Forbes and
Fifth avenues on Atwood Street,
it is a pizza paradise. Descend
the stairs into Pizza Sola’s dining
area, and prepare to be stunned.
Crowded mahogany tables boast
places for gloves, hats and jackets.
Ron Burgundy would be proud.

As my two friends and I wait-
ed in line,Vour eyes feasted on the
various selections of pizza. Pies as
big as Michael Phelps’ wingspan

decorated the countertop. The ‘
glass was the only thing keeping .
us from reaching out and grab- J

bing a slice.

This was not pizza in the tra— 
ditional college sense. This was 5

pizza with gourmet toppings —
there were intriguing combina-

tions, including fried eggplant

or Kalamata olives. Prices were '-

The man behind the counter

took our order. We took a slice

of the primavera, a heaping pie ;
served New York—style with roma- 
no and mozzarella cheeses, fried

eggplant, roasted red peppers,

mushrooms and onions (slice $4, J

small $13 and large $17).

We also grabbed a slice of the 
vesuvia, which is more of a pizza  ‘

Harry Potter-inspired rock is onstage magic.

Wizard Rock: The Whomping
Willows, Justin Finch—Fletchley
82. The Sugar Quills and Tonks
' G7. the Aurors

Tuesday, 6:30 pm.

Your Inner Vagabond Coffeehouse
4130 Butler St, Lawrenceville

41 Q-683-1 623

Harry Potter doesn’t exactly
scream rock ’n’ roll attitude. But
to many of his musically talented
fans, he’s the perfect inspiration.

“After being ‘really bummed
out about the fact that Millicent
Bulstrode wouldn’t dance with me
at the Yule Ball, I sat down with
a bottle of butterbeer. and started
paying attention to the band that
evening, the Weird Sisters,” re-
called Justin Edward Michaelman
in an e—mail to The Pitt News.

Well, no, he didn’t really inter-

act with classmates and charac-
ters from Harry Potter’s magical
world. A

However, Harry Potter’s world
certainly inspired Michaelman,
along with multitudes of other
fans. _ ’

.Wizard rock, the genre that
began with Harry and the Potters
in Massachusetts and is composed
simply of music about or inspired
by Harry Potter, has since spread

' throughout Ari‘1_e1:ica and interna-
tionally. An entire site known as the

Wizrocklopedia has developed as a
base, reporting on and promoting
the world’s wizard rock bands.

Of course, only three of the
500 and growing bands can rea-
sonably ﬁt within a coffeehouse.

_ The featured groups will be The
Whomping Willows, Justin Finch-_

Fletchley & The Sugar Quills, and
Tonks & The Aurors.

The bands each differ in their
speciﬁc song styles, with instru-
ments varying from guitars to key-
boards and tambourines. '

The , focus switches between
bands, too. The Whomping Wil-
lows likes to focus on the abusive
tree from the novels. Justin Finch-
Fletchley & The Sugar Quills has a_
song about the sweet shop where
wizard snacks are sold, and Tonks
& The Aurors has many‘ about,
well, Tonks the Auror.

Still, the roots that the bands
share remain the same as that of
all Harry Potter readers and fans.

“The values and ideals are a big
draw,” said Michaelman. “Also, in

Stephanie Anderson of the band known
as Tonks & The Aurors used the _Internet to
her full advantage after the conclusion of

the series inspired her to write out her song

ideas. .
“I” recorded two demos first and put

them on the band’s Myspace. Thanks to the

fans quickly,
and people

“I’ll also say
that Matt Mag-'

after the first show I played with him, hes

encouraged people to listen to my music and
book me for shows,” reflected Anderson.
“He helped me gain some respect from wiz—

1 ways —— from
genocide to government ignorance.

Even wizard rock music, which is often
fun, chipper and meant to bring smiles to the
fan base’s faces, has its moments of darkness.
Of course, not all dark moments have to in-
volve politics — heartbreak is as common in
wizard rock as in the mainstream.

“Some of my songs are ’bout pretty heavy
subjects,” said Anderson.

In line with
the namesake
of her group,
she discussed

how her songs
deal with the

tween Harry
' " Potter charac-
ters" Tanks and
Lupin — two
characters who
fall in love but
have some seri-
ous differences
and issues to
work through.
“It’s these
universal themes that lend themselves to mu-
sic, but there’s just Harry Potter references
thrown in here and there,” added Anderson.
“Tl'1ere’s deﬁnitely nothing funny about
these songs, but they’re still wizard rock. And

I love them a lot.”

Sola brings options toland of the $5 pie

Pizza Sola, page 6 '

i white pizza, servedjwith healthy spinach,

fresh tomatoes and a blend of feta and
mozzarella cheeses (slice $53.50, small $12
and large $16).

Ourslices were in the oven the moment
we ordered them. By the time we had or-
dered drinks.and' paid, they were hot and
sitting on ‘Om? table. I bit into the primaV-
era first. My greedy lips were greeted by a
delicious sauce that did not overpower the

cheese or vegetables. My friend, who is a.

self-described “vanilla eater,” enjoyed the
fusion of pizza and eggplant so much that
he refused to honor his commitment to
give me his slice after “just a taste.”

The vesuvia was deﬁnitely delicious, but
not on the same plane as the primavera.
The bianca balanced garlic, chicken and
tomato nicely, but it didn’t have the same
punch as the marinara sauce. That’s what
really made the primavera —- the perfect
blend of oregano and basil in the sauce.
It wasn’t too sugary like Papa John’s, but it
had an element of sweetness, enhanced by
roasted red peppers. ,

We ﬁnished these two slices as a kind of
appetizer, and we were already full. Yet an

‘ entire pic was on the way. That’s the beauty
of Pizza Sola. The prices seem high, but

The greco was brought out to us, al-
though it was’ clearly our-responsibility to
pick it up. It was a nice touch in an industry
usually devoid of customer service. It was
steaming when we opened the box, and
even though ‘I wasn’t hungry, I took a bite.
Feta blended with mozzarella in a cheese
marriageimade in dairy heaven. The crust,
hot and crispy, was by- far the best in Oak-

buttery. It was the kind of crust that you
hope is left over by some strange friend
who refuses to eat it. i .
Pizza Sola is a great new place for stu-

. The Pitt men’s basketball team might
‘ have had its worst shooting night of the year,

but season highs in offensive rebounds and _

second-chance points helped the Panthers
take down Akron 86-67 Friday night at the
Petersen Events Center.
Pitt shot 45 percent from the ﬁeld but
hauled in 22 offensive rebounds and 41 total
_— both season bests. -
_ ‘‘That’s always our goal, to outrebound a
team,” said Pitt sophomore Dejuan Blair.
The Akron Hawks (2-1) had 24 rebounds
total.
“We were just manhandled,” said Akron
coach Keith Dambrot.
Sam Young scored a season—high 26
points — 16 of which came in ‘the ﬁrst half
—— to lead all scorers.

“If you think Dejuan Blair is a beast, Sam ,

Young is no picnic either,” said Dambrot,
who then compared Young’s physicality to
Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James.

“He’s a tough matchup.’.’ .

Blair recorded his ‘second double—double
of the year, scoring 16 to go with his 13
rebounds. Eight of those rebounds were
offensive. Blair also led the team with ﬁve

steals and tied for second-best on the team _

with two assists.
“He’s got quick hands,” said Pitt coach
Jamie Dixon. “He likes to gamble.”

At one point in the ﬁrst half of Saturday’s

Volleyball

After first-round upset,

tourney dreams crash

by Randy Lieberman
Staﬂ Wrder

For the Pitt women’s volleyball team, it
was a matter of showing up for the home
crowd when it needed to the most.

The Panthers pulled off a ﬁrst—round upset
in the Big East tournament of No. 2-seeded
Cincinnati on Friday, but dropped their semi-
ﬁnal matchup against No. 3—seeded Louisville
on Saturday at the Fitzgerald Field House.

The Panthers, according to coach Toby
Rens, suffered too many early season losses to
receive an at—large bid for the NCAA Tourna-
ment; Pitt must now refocus for next season
and ﬁll the void left by ﬁve departing seniors.

“Everybody had a lot of great  to
say to the seniors in the locker room after-
wards,” said Rens. “A lot of the underclass—
men appreciated the leadership they provided
and the character they showed as a group.”

Junior Meagan Dooley led the Panthers in
their 3-1 loss against the Cardinals with ﬁve
blocks, including two solo blocks to push
her to second all—time in the Panthers’ career
solo-blocks list.

Dooley recorded her second double—dou—

ble of the season with a career—high 11 blocks
and 11 kills in the Panthers’ 3-2 victory over
the Bearcats.

The win was the Panthers’ ﬁrst in the Big
East tournament since 2004, when they took
down No. 3—seeded Syracuse. '

On Friday, the Panthers overcame a 0-2

‘deﬁcit to defeat the Bearcats in a thrilling,

ﬁve-set match. I

“We didn’t do a good job of executing our
game plan to the best of our abilities in the
ﬁrst two sets,” said Rens. “But we did a really
great job of executing in the next three.”

The win snapped the Bearcats’ 15-match
winning streak. ,

Junior Michelle Rossi said the most.im—
portant factor in Pitt  the game was

its blocking.

“We knew we had to pick up our defense «H

and blocking,” said Rossi.

The ﬁrst play out of halftime, Dooley
stuffed a Cincinnati attack to set the tone for
the Panthers.

“It’s so awesome when you say what’s go-
ing wrong and the very next play we ﬁx it,”
said Rossi. i

“Thatﬁrstdiivemusthavebeen 15

Scott McKil1op “I thought it kind of
set the tone for the ﬁrst halt?’

By  the clock and push-
ingPittbaclgPike emerged as aleader
for his team.

And his play did not- go unno-
ticed. . * '

“He has become more comfort-

able,” said Cincinnati coach Brian Kel-
ly. “He knows where he is protected
And he has a  of
where our guys are He was outstand-
ing tonight”

- Pike continued to direct the

‘ Bearcats’ oﬁense, which was on the

ﬁeld for nearly 35 minutes.
“We went about three quarters
where we could not make -a ﬁrst down

and keep the drive  on offense,” .

said Wannstedt. “And defensively we
couldn’t get them off the ﬁeld”
Cincinnati (9-2, 5-1) marched
down the ﬁeld in an 83-yard drive that
saw Pike toss _a 4-yard touchdown pass
to a standing Dominick Goodman

With fans already on the ﬁeld, a de-

the Panthers a ﬁnal chance

Desperate laterals and a ﬁimble

“You want to ﬁnish it, obviously,

and obviously have to depend on
somethinglike that to tie the game”

this season. Cincinnati beat Pitt in near-

The Bearcats also won the turnover

Wannstedt said he is focusing on

bounds and, apparently, a whole lot of fun.

Blair and the Panthers met up with for-
mer teammate Maurice Polen on the court,
who practiced with Blair a lot last year and is
playing for Indiana as a senior.

“[Blair] played phenomenally,” said Polen.
“I didn’t expect anything less.”

Joe Lombardi, head coach at Indiana and
a former Pitt assistant, deﬁnitely felt Blair’s
pressure.

“\lM(/as that Dejuan?” joked Lombardi. “I
thought that was Shaq. Dejuan was a man in
waiting last year. He’s arrived.”

Pitt’s win was its 100th at the Petersen
Events Center. '

For the ﬁrst seven minutes of the game,
the Crimson Hawks were nowhere to be
found. The team missed seven shots, and Pitt
was  up and down the court, dnv—
ing the score to 21-0 before Indiana’s Julian
Sanders scored from behind the arc.

From there, IUP went on a 13-2 run,

prompting coach Jamie Dixon to keep the
starters in. Blair dunked and Sam Young shot
at the buzzer, leaving the game at 45-17 at
halftime.

Tyrell Biggs, who ended the day with 10
points, started the scoring in the second half.
Blair followed with a layup that started the
Panthers on a seven—point scoring run.

\X/ith the Panthers up by more than 20
points, nearly everyone on Pitt’s roster saw
playing time in the second half, including the
fans’ picks, sophomores Ryan Tiesi and Tim
Frye.

Freshmen Travon Woodall, Ashton Gibbs
and Nasir Robinson all saw signiﬁcant play-
ing time without teammate Jermaine Dixon,
who sat more than usual because of a ham-
string issue. '

The Panthers play again tomorrow when
Belmont visits, and they will ﬁnish up the
Legends Classic next weekend in Newark,
NJ.
