Student T-shirt vendor ﬁned $300

By Renee Crespy
Staff‘ Writer

Another clothing vendor in the

‘i"Oakland area has received a ﬁne

for violating a city ordinance.

T om Chylinski, an economics
student at Pitt, received the
citation two weeks ago on the
same day that Charles Bonasorte
received a citation as part of the
city’s effort to halt his business,
The Pittsburgh Stop.

Chylinski, who sells tie—dyed

7'*‘T-shirts on the Pitt campus to

support himself while he’s in
school, is angered by the fine. “I
feel pretty disappointed that I
live in a city where I cannot
pursue my goals, ” said Chylinski.
“It’s not like [vendors] are a bunch
of vagrants hanging out on the
street corners. We're just trying to
make a buck.

“I have a license to sell, so the
city slapped me with a citation on

the basis of blockface. I move
every 30 minutes to a different
corner, but they want me to move
to a different block. If I moved to
a different block every 30 minutes,
I’d soon be down past Carnegie
Mellon [University], and then I’d
be nowhere,” said Chylinski.

A city ordinance requires
outside vendors to move to a
different block every 30 minutes.
Blockface is the same basis on
which Bonasorte was cited.

“I tried telling the housing
officials this and saying that I do
move every 30 minutes, but not
blockface. They were not very
helpful,” said Chylinski.

Chylinski also said that, unlike
Bonasorte, he hasn’t had any
problems with Pitt.

“I’m more upset with the city
than with the university. I don’t
think Pitt wanted me out, even
though I’m friends with
Bonasorte. If Pitt didn’t want me

none of the other vendors did,
and now they’re making an
example out of me. I’m really not
sure why they fined me, or if
they had just cause, but I don’t
think ithad to dowith Bonasorte,”
said Chylinski.

Chylinski said that he plans to
attend a City Council meeting on
Wednesday and make his views
about city vending ordinances
known.

“On Oct. 16 there is going to
be a meeting in front of City
Council for people who want to
speak out. I’m going to go to that
and try to change things, and in
the meantime I’ll still be out
there every day selling my shirts
to help pay off the $300 fine that
I can’t afford,” said Chylinski.

A potentially grave situation has been unearthed
in front of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity house on
North Dithridge Street.

In an annual ritual the pledges of Phi Delta Theta
dragged the 700- to 800—pound gravestone of the
late Henry Parker from the house of the Delta
Sigma Phi fraternity, three doors down.

“There’s a tradition of ‘stealing’ the stone,” said
Phi Delta Theta rush chairman Greg Rea. “We take
it in the fall, and [the Delta Sigma Phi pledges] take
it in the winter. Each pledge class does it differently. ”

This mutually agreed—upon swipe—fest has been
taking place since about 1961, when Phi Delta
Theta vacated the house Delta Sigma Phi now
occupies, leaving the Parker marker at rest, so to
speak, on rival ground.

This year the Phi Delta pledges decided to leave
the sepulchral stone in their front lawn. How Phi
Delta Theta originally got the stone is an undying
Pitt legend.

“One of the alumni from this house was ‘The
Voice of the Pirates,’ Bob Prince,” said Rea. “He was

a pledge [here] and not a good one. His brothers .

drove him somewhere. upstate and told him to get
back to the house by a certain time. He beat his
brothers back [to the house], and he came back
with the stone.”

'Grve situtioneartbed at fraternity houses

Since then, the “Old Gunner’s” granite grave-
robbed gift has been the source of much speculation
and many hernias. Much of the writing on the stone
is in Asian characters, which Rea attempted to have
translated without result.

More speculation has gone into figuring out just

how to get the thing a distance-of about 100 feet,

up and down stairs, without alerting any of the rival
house’s residents. '

“We got it about halfway up the steps in the [Delta
Sigrn_a Phi] basement at about 1:40 Thursday
morning," said Craig Collins, who took part in the
heist. “There was quite a bit of noise when they
found out we were taking the stone, and we left.

.We came back and got it at 5 in the afternoon the

next day.”

When asked if he was worried about the law
taking a dim view of playing “capture the flag" with
something designed to stay in one place, chapter
President Jeff Fox said that the original theft had
happened so long ago that he couldn't imagine
anyone being concerned.

“Besides, the guy who [originally] stole it is
dead," he said.

Already the stone has been festooned with
yellow blossoms by friendly female neighbors,
obviously anxious to make: the mobile marker
welcome in its home away from home.

“We’re talking about shoveling a pile of dirt in
front of it to see if anyone says anything,” said Rea.

Women still struggling for political equality in India

By Margaret Swisher
Staﬂ" Writer

Women are better suited than men to
rule but are fighting a losing battle in
India, said Usha Thakker, head of the
department of political science at SNDT
University in Bombay, India.

Dressed in a brown print sari, Thakker
discussed women and politics in India for
the Asian studies lunchtime lecture program

- 0 yesterday.

Powerless women became powerful
women when they were able to vote and
participate in politics, said Thakker.

“It was Gandhi who nationalized women

in India,” Thakker said. “It was a duty to
our nation; we had to come out."

A woman's life in politics is not easy,
according to Thakker.

“There is a whole culture of society that
limits the woman,” Thakker said. “Women
in politics are branded as non-feminine
and aggressive.”

When India gained its independence in
1950, the new constitution gave women
the right to vote. But in the first election
many women were not counted, according
to Thakker. “In India the woman does not
tell her name. She says mother of  or
wife of The first step was knowing your
name properly."

Most women in Indian politics come
from elite families. Women at the grass-
roots level have a very hard time getting
into politics. .

“Women have no support from political
parties and no resources,” Thakker said.

Women in politics at the village level are
making sure money and goods go to the
intended people. Thakker explained that
the Indian government’s schemes are
implemented in the villages.

“They give loans for cattle; men get the
loans, and the women work. The milk
gets sold for cash and is not given to the
children."

“Women at the village level are coming

up,” Thakker said. “They do something
for women and children.”

Thakker said that many factors prevent
women from entering politics. “Many
women can’t find their place in a male-
dominated politics,” Thakker said. “Mount-
ing election expenses and increasing
violence are two factors deterring women
from politics.”

Women in India are uniting and creating
a strong women's movement.

“Women are coming out in thousands
for the movement," she said.

The movement’s goals are to promote
equal rights for women, women's literacy
and the empowerment of women.

When and how the police can search you

By Mark Smith
Sta_ﬂ‘ Writer

Editor's note: The following is

J the third column in a series titled

“Know Your Rights, ” published
biweekly Tuesdays in The Pitt
News.

“The right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses,
papers and effects, against
unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated,
and no warrants shall issue, but
upon probable cause, supported
by oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place
to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.”

— The Fourth Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution

Question: Can a police
officer search me or my car if
I’m not under arrest?

Answer: For most searches
prior to arrest, the police need a
warrant or your permission. This
is important to remember. The

police can frisk you for a weapon
if they have reasonable suspicion
that you might have a gun, knife,
etc. If the police want to search
your car, you have to give them
permission, or they can search
your car if they have reasonable
cause to believe that you have
evidence of a crime or weapons
in your car. The police can seize
anything in “plain view.” In other
words, if you had a bag of
marijuana on your car seat, it
could be used as evidence.

Q. When can the police
search my home?

A. In order to search your home,
you must give your consent to
the police, or they must obtain a
warrant from a judge. If the police
come knocking on your door,
ask to see a warrant. The warrant
must be specific and include the
date and location of the search.
As the Fourth Amendment plainly
reads, the police may only search
for the items listed on the search
warrant. However, anything you
have in “plain view” can be seized

Q. What kind of searches

can the police do after a legal
arrest?

A. The police can search you
without a warrant after a legal
arrest. Sometimes they ask you to
empty your pockets, or they might
do it themselves. If you arrested
while in your car, the police can
search the vehicle. No warrant is
required. They can seize evidence
in plain view or from inside of
your car within your reaching

distance. However, they cannot
search your trunk unless they
have probable cause to believe it
contains evidence of a crime or
weapons. Of course, if you're

arrested in your car, the police _

will impound your car, obtain a
search warrant and then search
the trunk.

The situation is similar when
you’re arrested at home. When
the police come knocking on
your door, you don’t have to let
them into your home unless they
have an arrest warrant. If they
have one, they may look around
but only seize items in plain
view. It is important to remember:
items seized from an illegal arrest,
generally speaking, cannot be
used against you in court. This is
known as the “exclusionary rule. ”

Q. What is the “exclusionary
rule?”

A.The “exclusionary rule”,
established in Weeks us. United
States (1914), forbade the use of
evidence illegally obtained but
only in federal court. Although
states have been forbidden to
take part in unreasonable searches
and seizures since 1949 (only 51
years ago), the evidence obtained
illegally was admissible in state

The conference will use panels

audience to participate.

“What we’re trying to do is
have a series of panels, like ﬁring

In a round table the people can
have an exchange [of
information],; and then the
audience can have an exchange
with the people in the table,”

of Pittsburgh Housing Authority;

The conference will discuss
how drugs complicate issues like

Warren court expanded
Fourth Amendment
protections to citizens in
state courts. In 1961, the
Supreme Court ruled in
Mapp vs. Obiothat evidence
illegally obtained could not
be used in a state court.
This ruling expanded
individual rights. The case
involved Dolree Mapp, a
woman living in Cleveland.
Without a warrant of any
kind, the police found
“dirty” books in her upstairs

evidence was used to
convict Mapp on obscenity
charges. The state court
upheld her conviction, but
the Supreme Court, in a 6 to
3 majority, reversed her
conviction and fully applied
the “exclusionary rule” to
the states. Supreme Court
Justice Tom C. Clark wrote,
“All evidence obtained by

violation of the Constitution
is, by that same authority
[the Fourth Amendment],
inadmissible in a state

Israeli sanctions needed...

When Iraq invaded Kuwait, both the United Nations
and the United States moved swiftly to condemn Saddam
Hussein and impose a total economic embargo against
Iraq. Now these bodies face a similar situation, once
again in the Middle East.

The state of Israel, since its birth in 1948, has had to deal
with a constant threat from surrounding Arab nations. In
1967, Israel, after a bloody war with Jordan, occupied an
area around the West Bank of the Jordan River, an area
previously owned by Jordan.

Since that occupation Israel has ruled over the Palestinian
people with an iron fist. Any uprisings or protests have
been dealt with harshly.

A terrible reminder of this came last week during one

' of many Palestinian protests. Israeli police opened fire on

rioting Palestinian protestors at the holy Temple Mount
in Jerusalem, killing 21 and injuring more than -100.
_T he U.N. Security Council moved swiftly in unanimously

condemning Israel for this action. This condemnation ,

included a vote from the United States, a longtime
supporter and defender of Israel. The fact that the United
States voted for this measure, instead of abstaining or
even blocking the move, shows how strongly the world
is against the Israeli government.

Along with this condemnation the council also called
for an investigation into the incident. Israel, however,
refuses to cooperate, saying that the U.N. delegation
should stay away from Israel. Though Israel is not

, blocking the U.N. group’s entry, it is advising against it,
, which probably means that the delegation will not_go.

The United States has been placed in a terrible
predicament because of this tragedy. On one side, it must
condemn the actions against the Israelis for humanitarian
reasons. But it does not want to go too far, thereby
offending the best ally it has in a hostile region.

Israel’s economy depends heavily upon U.S. aid. Without
it its economy would collapse, and an Arab invasion,
even against the Israeli armed forces, considered some of
the best in the world, would likely mean the end of that
country.

The United States needs to step in and resolve this
situation. Israel has shown its unwillingness to negotiate
with the Palestinians. By placing humanitarian standards
on its aid to Israel, our country could go a long way in
defusing an always heated crisis.

America has shown its support for economic blockades
in the past, most notably against Iraq. It is time that we
initiate another sanction to prevent further violence.

U.S. should reconsider arms sale

The recent proposal by the United States to sell
some of its most advanced weaponry to Saudi
Arabia is a move that I firmly oppose. It is a betrayal
of one of the United States’ closest allies, Israel. For
so long the American-Israeli lobby has worked
diligently to prevent something like this because it
is a great threat to the security of a potentially very
vulnerable Israel. Selling these weapons is a threat
because it substantially undercuts Israel’s much-
needed military power.
Why is Israel such a valuable ally to the United
States? [They maintain] and support facilities for the

U.S. naval forces in the Eastern

really aid its defense? [...]

The United States must realize that it is putting a
friend at great risk, and I think the sale should be
reconsidered.

Abortion not safe

disturbing for many reasons,
including its use of name-,
calling and its attempt to

exercises between Israeli forces
and U.S. forces in the region take‘
place regularly. Furthermore, as can be seen so
clearly now, Israel is the sole stable, democratic,
pro—Western ally in an area characterized by political
instability, religious ferment and Islamic
fundamentalism. Another example among many is
improvements made by Israel on U.S. weapons
systems. The two countries share in cooperative
research and development of these systems, which
in effect reduce the cost of America’s defense.
Additionally, most aid to Israel is spent in the

United States. For every billion dollars of assistance, »

60,000 American jobs are created. It is also interesting
to note that, although some were unhappy when
Israel bombed the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in
1981, the world can only thank Israel now. The

present situation in the Middle East would have"
. been an even more dangerous one if it were not for

that bombing.

Although Saudi Arabia has partially financed
such organizations as the Palestinian Liberation
Organization and has been active in or financed
parts of a number of the offensive wars against
Israel, I do realize that they have legitimate,
increased, short-term defense needs because of the
current Iraqi affair. However, it needs to be
questioned whether the nature of the weapons
package goes far beyond Saudi Arabia’s legitimate
defense needs and may lead to further regional
instability in the future. [...] For example, Kuwait
has acquired tens of billions dollars’ worth of
sophisticated armaments which are now in the
hands of the occupying Iraqis. So the United States’
own weapons may be used against itself. A final
point is that prior to the Iraqi invasion, Saudi Arabia
had purchased close to $100 billion worth of the
world's most advanced weapons. Even before the
first Iraqi plunge, Saudi Arabia had asked for U.S.
protection, showing itself to be impotent even with
all of its weaponry. Is having another $10,000 or
even 10 billion dollars worth of weapons going to

portray pro-lifers as religious
zealots. They used offensive
language to express their total disregard for life.
This only reflects their lack of respect and logic and
their inability to refute what Mary Beddingﬁeld
said about abortion, Margaret Sanger and Planned
Parenthood.

We would also like to dispel the myth propagated
by the pro-abortionists that pro-lifers try to impose
their religious beliefs on others. Pitt Students For
Life is composed of women and men of various
religious beliefs as well as those that subscribe to
no religious doctrines. Students For Life is not a
religious organization but a human- rights
organization. Abortion is a human-rights issue
because of its abhorrent treatment of women and
pre-born babies. Furthermore, we find scandalous
the systematic cover-up of the numerous
psychological and physical injuries and deaths that
women have suffered from “safe, legal” abortions.

Mary Beddingfield, a local African American pro-
lifer, spoke of the disproportionate number of
abortions that minorities receive. The letter attacked
her and called her “strange” for telling the truth
about how abortion is killing many black women
and their pre-born babies. [...]

People that are pro—life are united, not in a
“horrible crusade,” but a crusade to save 1.5 million
pre-born babies a year, the lives of their mothers
and the welfare of both during pregnancy and after
birth. The pro-life cause is best furthered by
genuine concern for the mother and her baby. This
concern is evident in our support for M om’s House,
Birthright, Genesis House and numerous crisis-
pregnancy centers.

In closing, we shall continue to address the true
issue of abortion, that is: Abortion stops a beating
heart.

Pitt's poor
turnout
brings
criticism

I’ve heard a lot of talk the 

past week about how the
Pirates’ publicity people
failed to get the word out
about available playoff seats.
Maybe those same people
now work at Pitt, judging
from the attendance at
Saturday’s homecoming
game. The “crowd” of 32,041
was less than respectable.
Calling 32,041 people at a
major college’s homecoming
game is like calling a lit
Bunsen burner an inferno.
It was more like a
gathering of folks than
-thousands of fans. At any
rate, some items other than
the empty seats caught my
eye during the game: Coach
Paul Hackett was right on
the money when he
suggested that Ricardo
McDonald be named game
captain every week. The
junior outside linebacker

Dere
Willis

simply put on a dominating
show, evoking images of
Lawrence Taylor and yes,
Hugh Green. While I’m at it,
McDonald’s counterpart
Heath Snell, did a good job
filling in for Curtis Bray.
Another player seeing
significant time for the first
-time was freshman Ricardo
“Tinker” Harris. After
Saturday’s game, it’s my
opinion that you can never
have enough Ricardos on
your team. Harris could be a
longtime starter at
cornerback, and he played
with conﬁdence and with
the poise of a veteran. The
real test will come against
Louisville and Miami, two
high-octane offenses with
excellent quarterbacks.
While I was pleasantly
surprised by the play of
Darnell Dickerson at
receiver, it’s obvious that he
did have a slight advantage
over the man covering him
— about nine inches to be
exact. Ron Allen, at 5 feet 7
inches, was matched up on
the 6-foot—4-inch Dickerson
all afternoon.
Still, Dickerson did show
that he can catch the ball
and contribute to this
‘offense. If Dickerson can
concentrate onthe ﬂight of
the ball, Hackett could have
a big weapon on his hands,

Pitt basketball team hits the hardwood

By Scott Campbell

Asst. Sports Editor

Where were you at 5:30

yesterday afternoon?
Brock Generalovich was

». ;, pr, skipping rope. Travis Ziegler was
A executing the Mikan drill. Jason

Matthews was dribbling a ball in
each hand. Omo Moses was
jumping back and forth over a
bench.

All this can only mean one
thing -— basketball is back.

Oct. 15 marks the annual date
that college basketball teams can
begin practice, and the Panthers
were no exception.

Although last year’s squad
finished with a disappointing 12-
17, Pitt Coach Paul Evans is hoping
to cook up a return to the top of
the Big East Conference, and this
year’s team will have a different
ﬂavor to help.

Eight new faces will don the
blue and gold this year, giving
Evans more scholarship players
than in any of his previous four
years as coach.

Gandhi Jordan, Jermaine Morgan,
Omo Moses and Ahmad Shareef),
one junior-college transfer
(Antoine Jones) and two
sophomores who sat out last year
to fulfill academic requirements
(Chris McNeal and Dominic
Dumancic) will finally give Evans
a chance to rest his veterans now
and then.

This year’s seniors (Brian
Shorter, Jason Matthews, Bobby
Martin and Darelle Porter)
averaged over 36 minutes per
game last year, a factor which led
the team to lose six of its lasteight
games, keeping the team out of
post-season play for the first time
since 1983.

“Last year was a learning
experience. I wouldn’t say that
we want to put it behind us,” said
Matthews. “But having a bench
this year will help us in games
that go down to the wire. Last
year we -lost some close games,
but this year we won’t let that
same thing happen.”

The new season is not without
its casualties already, however.

practice because of tendonitis in
his left knee, and McNeal will
miss a week with a groin pull.

One bonus for the Panthers
will be the return of guard Sean
Miller, who missed all of last year
after foot surgery.

With the trio of Miller, Porter

and Matthews back together, '

Evans said the Panthers will go
back to their three—guard rotation
of two years ago, with both Miller
and Porter seeing time at the
point.

Other than that Evans couldn't
say much concerning a set lineup.

“Obviously Brian will be there.
But we might have eight or nine
kids start at different times,” said
Evans.

This year’s team is already
receiving high grades from
various basketball magazines. The
Big East Yearbook, The Sporting
News, and Street and Smiths all
pick the Panthers to win the
conference as well as ﬂnish in the
Top 10 nationally. But Evans gave
his annual “debunking the polls”
speech yesterday to contest the

Five freshmen (Tim Glover,

Soccer co-captain ﬁnds his niche at Pitt o

By Christopher Block
Staﬂ“ writer

In a year best described as tumultuous or rocky,
the Pitt soccer team has found a bright star to look
to. Senior co-captain Roberto Croce has provided
the defense with ﬂashes of brilliance and confident
leadership.

He was born in Switzerland but moved to the ,

United States as a youngster. Croce got a late start
in soccer, beginning play in ninth grade at age 15.

The reason for his late start was ‘a result of his
previous participation in football. He ended his
football career in eighth grade to concentrate on
soccer. He was a four—year varsity letterman at
Chartiers Valley High School, where he played
stopper and midfielder in his first and second
years. He was a captain in his junior and senior
years, where he alternated between stopper and
midfielder. He played extremely well in high
school, earning an honorable mention in the
Western A Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic
League.

Following his high—school career Croce enrolled
in the Community College of Allegheny County,
where he was a standout in both soccer and
academics. He played varsity for two years and
was named team captain in his ﬁnal year.

Besides being named captain at CCAC, Croce
received honors from coaches around the league.
He was named all-state, all—region and all-mid-East
by the coaches and was an academic All-American.

In his last year there Croce was joined on the
Allegheny team by former Pitt soccer players
Heinz Pak and Mark Mostinckx. The team went 17-
2-1 and advanced to the final game of the regionals
before succumbing to defeat.

When considering what college to attend after
CCAC, Croce explored Davis and Elkins, Wheeling
Jesuit, John Carroll and Pitt. He chose Pitt because
it was the best offer, academically and financially.
He also wanted to continue playing with Pak and
Mostinckx; as well, Pitt was close to his home.

At Pitt Croce seems to have found his niche. As
a senior this year Croce has achieved a high place
in the team leadership; he and Nick Liberati were
named team captains by Coach Joe Luxbacher.

As far as this year’s team goes, Croce is optimistic.

“We didn’t really know what to expect from this

See Croce, page~6

Porter will miss about a week of

high expectations.

“I don't see much reason for
that," said Evans. “A team that
finished 12-17, had three kids try
out for national teams and not
survive the first cut, and we have
a bunch of untested freshmen;
they probably picked a lot of
upsets that looked better in April
than they do now."

The Panthers’ first exhibition
game is only 16 days away, when
Marathon Oil comes to the
Fitzgerald Field House on Nov. 1.

Pl'l'l‘ BlTS£ This year’s schedule
features a trip to UCLA, the» first
time the Panthers have visited
the famed Pauley Pavilion in 18
years, The game will also be a
homecoming of sorts for
Matthews, who grew up in Los
Angeles and was a UCLA ball boy
in seventh grade ..
excited to see the University of

Miami join the Big East, saying, <

“It helps make the conference
stronger. There was always a

’ concern about Syracuse and Pitt

defectin g because of football. But
the solution made the football
schools and the basketball schools

happy.”

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News
Robert Cr-oce's heady play has been a bright spot for the Panther soccer team.

year’s team. We have a very strong
team, with a few key veterans

plus a good batch of freshmen

that have played very well. We
started the season off well and
then had a bunch of disappointing
losses on the road.”

He is equally as confidentwhen
discussing the Panthers’ chances
in the Big East this year.

“We still have a_ good shot at
the Big East. We could’ve played
better against Georgetown, but
we have to look forward. If we
play well like we did at St. John’s,
then we will be a very capable
team.”

Pak played with Croce for three
years and notes, “Roberto is good
at marking the opposition’s
players. He means a lot to the
team because he brings
composure and is a strong leader.
He has a really good attitude and
deserves being named captain.”

even against Notre Dame’s famed
secondary. It’s a shame that
Darnell’s most impressive play, a
38-yard catch and run, was called
back because of a holding call.

Speaking of penalties, there
were far too many against Rutgers.
Sure, when you’re leading by 21
points, it isn’t a big concern. But
against Notre Dame and Miami
mistakes could cost Pitt the ball
game.

In case you were confused
when you saw No. 26 lining up at
‘fullback and thought Derrick
Lewis had rejoined the team, he
didn’t. Wearing his old number
is Joe Conlon, a backup defensive
end forced into action because of
injuries and Lewis’ departure. He
can block, but don’t expect him
to catch too many screen passes
out of the backfield.

One more thing: In Scott
O’Brien, Pitt has the best special-
teams coach anywhere. Period.
Time and time again, the special
teams have risen to the occasion.
On Saturday Vernon Lewis’ punt

V block all but shutthe door on a

surging Rutgers team. Special
teams are just as important as
offense and defense are, and Pitt
has the best coach in Scott
O’Brien. His players are testament
to that.

for WPTS-FM.)
