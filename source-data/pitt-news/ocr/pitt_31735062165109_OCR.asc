jlohnstoniﬂeleases Statement, on CD,

Plans Underway for   Signs, Guards I

A statement of the University’s policy on civil defense?
was released Monday afternoon by Louis W. H.» Johnston,l

Director of Civil Defense.

'41‘

The statement, which was authorized to'be_ published un-
der the signature of Acting Chancellor Charles B. Nutting,
is the outgrowth of a meeting held -last Oct. 3, by the
University’s Committee on Civil Defense.

‘ Old Policy Reaches Plateau .

At this meeting, it was decided that the CD Policy, for-
merly. in existence had. reached a plateau or leveling off

point, insofar as serious changes’ a

were not needed. V The commit-
tee recommended that after cer-

tain minor changes had been en-
acted-'the revised policy should be
sound enough" for release to the
University community.

The complete statement is as
follows: The University of Pitts-
burgh recognizes its obligation to
have a civil defense policy that
concerns itself about the physical
welfare of the University commu-
nity in theevent of a national

emergency, promotes good public

relations, and contributes tohigh
morale among‘ . officers, __facultyr,'
ployees. . c M "'

  
  

“The Oiﬁce of Civil Defense has
responded, and will respond
promptly to every reasonable re-
quest from the responsible public
authorities for use of University
facilities and personnel, or for
other participation in the educa-.
tional and preparedness activities
‘of the Civil Defense program. In
Dec. 1954, for example‘ it spon-
sored jointly with the Federal
Civil Defense Administration a re.._
gional conference on the protec-
tion of industrial plants.
This ‘conference was held on

- campus, and seventeen members

  
 

. _ of"tlie faculty served as consult-

..«r

 

ants, _lecturers, and discussion
leaders. And the University
stands. ready to activate on short
notice‘ a continuing program_,of
protective and salvage services
whenever such a program is
adopted kiiy consensus of the
community or by__prdcr of pub-
lic authority.
“The Director of, Civil Defense
is responsible for keeping himself
informed and informing the Uni-

, versity Administration on the na-

ture and scope of. the probable
demands on the University in civil
defense matters, and for prepara-
tions to. comply with those de-

mands as promptly and complete-

ly as possible, with a minimum of
expense and disruption of normal
operations. ‘

Food Drive C

The Interfraternity Council’ A

annual Canned Goods drive
ended last Tuesday with a
“disappointing” number of
cans being collected by the
fraternity men.

Ron Sobel, Col. ’57, chairman of
the IF Special Projects committee,
said earlier this week that the
total number of cans collected

“was a little disappointing.”

“We didn’t nearly approach our
goal, (10,000 cans) but right now
I think I can say that we did as
well this year as we did last,”
Sobel added.

‘ Since all the-fraternities have
not made their reports, the
total number of cans collected

wa.sn’t determined Monday, but 

Sobel expects to have complete
ﬁgures today. including the two,
fraternities which collected the
most cans. The two top fratern-
ities will receive trophies.
Last year’ approximately 5000-
cans were collected, with the win‘-
ner being Phi Epsilon Pi.

A After the Guild Customs Mentor Party this coming Fri-
day afternoon, freshman women will be permitted to par-
ticipate in campus activities. A renovated Guild system’ will
take effect beginning Monday and extend through Apr. 2.
It seems rather late for-the women to enter into activi-
ties, but changesahave been made \in the women’s program
' again that deserve cursory discussion. For it was only last
semester that the women gave freshmen the right to join
activities at their discretion upon completion of the,Senior
Mentor program.

After barely a semester of trial which gave the neW- _

I comers complete freedom, upperclass women have decided
to restrict activities participation to guild units. .According

‘ to WSGA chairman Mary Vichich, the move was made .

because freshman women “didn’t have the chance to meet
other freshmen.” - ‘

However, the women have" attempted. to reach a com-
promise between what'has proven to them to be a'«social
failing and what admittedly has been in the past an inade-

. quacy in activity participation. Instead of segmenting the
. women to individual «guild choices which conform more to
_ » their schedules than to their desires, the guild meetings will
alternate, every other week—first, women will‘ attend meet-
' ings; then they will work respective campus activity.
Now, _we must agree that freshman women will cer-'
’tainly get to meet their classmates. This is an admirable
aspect of the committee’s desires, although we question. the
actual value of the time element. 0

Under the present plan, freshmen have, been given two
months of formalmentor training to orient them with the
University; now they will enter into four months of guild
orientation. Considering that a full semester is less than ten
months, women are being conﬁned to unusual restrictions

. which h_ardly enable them the privilege of deciding those
activities in which they wish to participate. . R
While the women’s program may boastclose -relation-‘

_' , ‘ships amongjfreshmen, it hardly enhances mature judg-\

 

_ ment and critical thinking on the part of these‘ frosh. They’
must learn to meet their own friends; they must learn to
measure their own limitations in activities. E

There are also mechanical faults in the program. It will

choir guilds to alternate.weekly'meetings when aplay or
concert is approaching. Even in such an organization as the

. Omnibus consistent effort before publication deadline is im-
perative. Some arrangements need be ‘made to correctthis
situation before the program is effected.

We feel that the women are making a sincere effort
to compromise thorough orientation and activity partici-
pation. However, we feel that greater eﬁfort should-be ex-

,_ pended, to integrate the women into-the functioning pro-
gram and less time spent providing “social work” care for

newcomers.

Molding Men from Boys

By Ed Bachmcm

(Editor’s Note: Bachman re-
cently represented the American
.colleges and universities at Pen-
sacola, Flag, as guest of the
Secretary of the Navy.‘ While
there, he, along with approxi-
mately 60 newsmen and radio-
men, was shown the complete
operation of the Naval Air
Cadet program.)

Last week.I saw men being
molded out of boys on a mass
producttion system. I saw kids
from all walks of life gain a new
conﬁdence in themselves——,a_ con-

Dear Sir:

In reading the Nov. 16 issue
of the Pitt News, I couldn’t help
but laugh at the letter from Bob
Sedler, president of Student
Congress. It clearly impressed
me as a letter from a student
who‘ just didn’t want to get on
the bad _side of the Chancellor
and the Dean of Men. He stated
that, “last Monday we disgraced
ourselves in the eyes of the
community and in the eyes of
our neighboring schools."

I should very much like to
refer the -president of Student
Congress’ to the Monday issue
of ‘the Pittsburgh newspapers.
They called our victory celebra-
tion, “a' gentlemanly, good na-
tured display of school spirit."
They also made mention of the‘
fact that, “the cops stood around
in their
pockets.” ~

The Monday evening T.V.
newscasts also made mention of
the fact -that the demonstration
was quite orderly. I ask Mr.
Sedler, “Is. this disgrace in the

In addition to this public rela-
tions job the Navy is faced with,
a great number of qualiﬁed men
must be recruited t the Naval
Air Cadet (NavCa ) program.
Men must be convinced of the
need of naval pilots. They must
be ‘presented with the pros and
cons of their future as pilots and
as naval oﬁicers.

‘Air Factory‘

With these purposes in mind,
the Secretary of the Navy last
week invited many representa-
tives from the news ﬁelds to see
their_“air factory.” They showed
us, in great detail, all the ﬁne

-\

points of their pilot training. Na-- ,

turally this was done with the
idea of our publicizing the pro-
gram. But we were not given
propaganda. We were presented
the real thing. ’

‘I, as well as some of the na-
tion’s top newsmen and radio-
men, was wide-eyed at the dem-
onstration put on for our bene-
ﬁt. The sight of young men in
airplanes about to make their
ﬁrst solo ﬂight is very stirring. ‘It
is one of the big moments of a
man’s life, to be all alone with
the controls of a plane.

As some of the pilots came in
for theirﬁrst landing it looked

‘Furthermore, I should- like to
point out that after last year’s
upset victory over West Virginia

an announcement was made by

Dean Biddle at the victory rally
that classes could not be called
off and that he expected the
-students to actfjaccordingly. The
result—a ‘quiet celebration in the
Commons Room.

Why "wasn’t ta similar an-
nouncement made this year?
Why wasn’t the ‘situation ex-
plained to the student body at
the rally? . . . Treat the students‘

like matured men and women"

rather "than a insane and de-
struction—happy mob.

In closing, I should like to re-
mind Mr. Sedlerpthat the ex-'
tent of damage done to the valu-
able paintings at Chatham was a
bent cardboard frame ,which
was easily repaired and could
have been done quite by acci-g
dent as I am sure it was.

Ivy Leaguers More intellectual

Liu Compares Harvard to Pitt

Studies Leagues’
Eastern Program,

Formulates Course
By Nancy C. Jones’

“This is a poor man’s -Harvard.
But even a poor man can catch
up.” That is the conclusion of Dr.
James Liu, professor of Far East-
ern history, in his comparison of
Harvard and Pitt. Dr. Liu who
is on leave of absence from Pitt
is doing work at Harvard through
a special Ford 1°: culty fund to en-
large Pitt’s Far Eastern program.

The program has already receiv-
ed “some national recognition and
is one of three such undergraduate
programs in the country —— the
other two schools with similar
programs are Wisconsin and
Southern California.

Because of Pitt’s specialized pro-
gram on China and Japan, stu-
dent interest has spread to other
parts of Asia. “My work now is
in response to the demand of the
students,” Dr. Liu said.

Compares Ivy Leaguers

Comparing Ivy League students
and Pitt students, Dr. Liu said
“our average students are lower
scholastically but “our best stu-
dents are not necessarily inferior
to their best students. We must
improve the average student.”

It is true there are a number
of “play boys” in the Ivy League
colleges. “But the better stu-
dents read more and talk more
-—' not about inconsequential
matters. They discuss politics
and world affairs. Therefore
among the better students you
get a community of learned
rather than a group of college
kids”

Dr. Liu has been thoroughly
convinced by his work at Har-
vard that Pitt must have better
library facilities. At various times
he has discussed this Droblem
with faculty members and library
staff. Some of the suggestions to
make Pitt’s libraries more effec-
tive are a shuttle elevator to the
ﬁfth ﬂoor for the use of those
going to the library, a smoking
area somewhere in the library so
that students may study and
smoke too, earphones so that stu-
dents can read to musi: or just
relax listening to it., a coffee ma-
chine in the library, and plenty of
paper-bound books for browsing.

Student Interest Necessary

“Unless the students show more
interest in bettering the inade-
quate library facilities nothing
will berdone,” Dr. Liu said. “We
could have even better facilities
than Harvard.”

One of the troubles with many
Ivy League colleges is that they
“have many ﬁrst rate scholars
who are not necessarily ﬁrst rate
teachers.” Too many scholars are
more interested in research than
in their students.

Pitt pays more attention to ef-
fective teaching according to Dr.
Liu. “We should continue to use

FAR EAST--Dr.‘ James Tzu-
chien Liu, associate professor of

history, points to his native
China on a world map. Liu, is
presently on leave of absence

from the University, traveling to
Ivy League colleges to determine
means to improve the Far East-
ern inter-departmental major
courses, Pitt has instituted.

more visual material and Eet more
mimeographed material into the
hands of students before class
meetings.”

Program Compartmentalized

Dr. Liu said Harvard has a
good Far Eastern program on the
graduate level. Their program is
specialized and compartmentalized
into Russian history, Indian his-
tory, etc. .

Dr. Liu is capturing and
adapting the essence of each of
these parts and putting them
together to aid in his new course
to be ‘offered next year called.
“Asian Civilization.” He is vis-
iting classes and collecting out-
lines and syllabuses.

In the spring Dr. Liu will .visit
Cornell, which is outstanding for
history of South East Asia; Prince-
,ton, which has good courses on
the Middle East (Arabic world),
and the University of Pennsyl-
vania, which specializes in Indian
history.

Head Biologist r-Compiles

London-Born Researcher Learned
Cooking and Writing FromFather,
Reviews Books In Downtown Press

By SHELEY WEISS
Today, cooking has become an art, a science. Perhaps this
explains the culinary interest and knowledge of Gourmet

" Dr. Peter Gray, head of the Department of Biological Sciences

and professor of ‘zoology at the University of Pittsburgh. ,

It was from his .father, that Gray learned about the tech-
niques of cooking. Through close associationwith his father
in Paris, when Gray was not in school, he developed his taste

 ‘for the “beautiful blends of ﬂavor of French and Italian cook-
Hing. " V

Like his father who was a writer, Dr. Gray is writing

articles for the Pittsburgh Press:

His writing, however, extends

. beyond the realm of cooking alone,

for he has reviewed biographies
and cookbooks.

As an apparent _result of his
praise of Molly- Goldberg’s Cook-
book, local department “stores re-
-port a sellout. Why did he enjoy

‘the book? “It was clear-‘and fun

/

to read.”

Diversiﬁed in his interests and
abilities,-Dr. Gray’s present un-
dertakingvto complete his own.
cookbook, to be published by
the_ Oxford University Press.
Including 1000 recipes from,
twelve countries, including
China and the Middle East, Dr.
Gray likes to think of the book
being entitled The ' Mistress
Cook. This would be an incen-
tive, he claims, for a sequel,

Likes Cooking Simple

"‘I" like cook-ing to be either
extremely simple or ‘ extremely
complicated,”_ says Dr. Gray. He

likes horseradish with roast beef,
but “anything on steak spoils it.”
His description of tartar sauce
as an. “abomination” was fol-
lowed by the explanation that
_ “What the 7A/meriacns use isn"t,
tartar saucel_ Tartar sauce’ is
merely a combination of first-
class mayonnaise‘ (made of eggs
and oil), seasoned with the -herb,
thyme, and enriched with a mi-
nute bit of mustard.” -

Both he and his wife cook at
home, his wife specializing in sal-
ads made of nothing more than
lettuce, oi-1, wine vinegar, and gar-
lic. She also makes the desserts,
one of his favorites. being creme
renversee, a baked custard.

Generally, he p r e p a r e s the
meats, sauces, and ﬁsh which sel-
dom appear on their family menu.
Two of his favorite ﬁsh dinners,
however, are geﬁlte ﬁsh-a
chopped- and cooked “Jewish deli-
cacy—-and couquille St. Jacques, a
“delightful, French type ﬁsh Dev-
onshire.” Since “good soup can’t
be made in less than two days,”

canned soup is most popular wit

him for‘ expediency. , '

which he has an adamant dis-
