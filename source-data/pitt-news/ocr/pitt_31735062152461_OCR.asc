acter. After graduating from
Princeton University in 1905, and
later from the Union Theological
Seminary, he became associate p_as-
tor of the Brick ‘Presbyterian
Church in New York City and later,
as Director of the American Par-
rish, did extensivework among the
immigrant population of the upper
East Side in New York City.

Shifting his interests from the
field of theology to that of journal-

ism, Mr. Thomas then became suc-

cessively editor of the “World To-
morrow” and associate editor of the
“Nation” magazine, and in 1923
was editor of the short-lived “New
York Leader,” labor magazine.

Was Presidential Candidate

-In politics Mr. Thomas is an
ardent Socialist and was candidate
for the Presidency in 1928. At pres-
ent he is the Executive Director of
the League for Industrial Democra-
cy, whose headquarters are in New
York City.

With the consent of _ the as*2m-
blies committee, the Y. M. C. A. will
include this assembly in the four-
program of its second campus con-
ference of the school year.

Women Open
Rush Season
F ebr_u_ary 26

Two Hundred Rushees
Received Invitations‘
In Mail Yesterday

Approximately two hundred rush-
ing invitations were mailed to
prospective sorority members early
yesterday morning, the ﬁrst move
in an intensive rushing season for
women which is to extend through-
out next week-end. Taking last

year’s ﬁgures as an index,‘an aver-
age of two out of every three girls
will become pledges to one of the
seventeen ‘women’s groups.
Invitations are blanket for all af-
fairs held next Thursday and Fri-
day, in order that the rushee may
arrange her program on a preferen-
tial basis. Answers must be writ-
ten and mailed or placed in the so-
rority mail boxes at Heinz House on
or before Tuesday noon of next
week.

Rushing parties will extend from
Thursday, February 26, 5:00 p‘. m.
to 9:00. p. m.; Friday, February 27,
12:30 p. m. to 12:00 m., and Sat-
urday, February 28, 8:00 a. m. to
1:00 a. m.

Invitations for Saturday parties
may be given personally or mailed
any time after 8:00 a. m., on the
second day of rushing. By this
time fraternity members will have
some basis of elimination and the
parties will be more selective and in-
dicative of the bid lists.

Engage Clubs

Hotels and country clubs have
been. besieged for the past two weeks
in the effort to get enough to ac-
commodate seventeen groups in the
two-night limit set by Panhellenic
Council, which fulﬁll speciﬁcatio/ps
set by the student relations commit-
tee.

Nearly three hundred copies of
the official Panhellenic publication,
0 Phelos, were mailed to freshmen
and prospective rushees yesterday
by the freshman education commit-
tee, headed by Mary Julia Shelton,
.Col. ’32. Taking the form of a fra-
ternity almanac, this booklet com-
bined the information formerly i_s-
sued in two editions released in
September and February. A new
feature was the cut of each frater-
nity pin accompanying the.names of
the members. The_ 1981 issue was
edited by the publications commit-
tee, Elaine Foraker, Col.‘ '32, and
Yetta Cohen, Col. ’33.

Offering a few words of counsel
to prospective rushees, Sarah Drum,
Col. ’31, president of Panhelleific
Council, reminds them, “Too often
people get the wrong idea of rush-
in . They make of it a strained and
un appy time. Try to go to these
parties with the same attitude that
you would to any party. Have a
good time; be natural. Look ‘for
real value in girls, not superﬁciali-
ties. Let’s all co-operate in making
this rushing season an opportunity
to cement friendships already be-

.. on “Financing a Business” before

the regular weekly luncheon meet-
ing of Alpha Kappa Psi, profes-
sional business fraternity, held in

used when competitors marge; lghlrd»
the circular merger, employed in an

Mr. Mahony advocates business
mergers because they effect large

Delta Tau Fraternity
Declared Dissolved

Beta Tau, local Jewish fraternity
that“ organized several months ago
for the purpose of petitioning the
national Zeta Beta Tau fraternity,
was formally declared non-existent
at a recent meeting of the Frater-
nity committee of the University.
As a result of this action, members
of the fraternity are freed from all
obligations.

Lawrence Spiegelglass, Dent. ’32.
one of the prime instigators of the
fraternity, said, “Financial reasons
were responsible for our decision to
disband the fraternity. Zeta Beta
Tau was in agreement with our ac-
tion, feeling ‘that such action was
ﬁstiﬁed by the unusual stress of

' rd times, and said that at a fu-
ture time, conditions having im-
proved, it would gladly reconsider

. the installation of a chapter at

Pitt.”

Spiegelglass, who took the initia-
tive in the project, was a member
of the chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fra-
ternity at New York University. At
the time of its dissolution, Beta Tau
possessed ten members, some of
whom were of prominence on the
University campus, such as Eddie
Hirshberg, captain of the football
team, and Zola. Alpert, three letter-
man of last year. Since the fra-
ternity has disbanded, many of ~ its
members have joined other local fra-
ternities. " -

Say, what is your idea. of a real
Junior Prom? If someone suddenly
poked his ﬁnger at you and
»shouted “Junior Prom” real quick,
what would you think of first?
Would the name call up all lovely
visions of ﬂowing draperies, Spanish
tangos and full moons‘! Or would
it make you remember that since
last Saturday night Dad, the Buick,
and you, haven't been the pale you
used to be? Or wouldn’t it cause
any mental gymnastics at all? Any-
ow, we have been going about the
campus poking ﬁngers and getting
ideas on the Prom. And if you
think that’s a silly thing to do, wait
until you've read some of the
answers.

The first one approached was a
sophomore-—-a very grave mistake-
who puffed up very important-like
and said, “Sure, I’m going, and it’d
better be good. I like smooth music,
smooth cats, and smooth partners
(or maybe he said ‘keen music, keen
eats, etc.’). And the Pitt Prom is
the place to get ’em. My bro/chefs
lending me his full dress coat and
white tie, and maybe his girl's room-
mate. Sure I’m going.”

The next was a Dental Juniou-.
“Am I going to the Prom‘! Listen,
for two weeks now I’ve been doing
everything but selling tangeri-nes. If
things go right by the 20th I’ll have
exactly $15.00 saved and that’s go-

Military Ball
Contest Opens

 

 

Results of First Week’: Ticket &

Sale Up Today

-:_———-

Harold McLean, Bus. Ad. ’31, Ca-
det‘ First Captain, R. O. T. C., and
Hermine Ruoif, Col. '31, Honorary
Major, will lead the grand march
at the annual Military Ball to be
held Friday evening, March 20, in
the ballroom of Hotel Schenley,
when members of the corps and
their friends turn out in a. bod to
attend the only military social f1y1nac-
tion of the year.

All R. O. T. C. cadets attending
the ball will be in formal dress, the
blue and gold uniform of the corps
bem the speciﬁed dress. The ball
will likewise formal for all those
present who are not members of
the military organization. .

Tickets were placed on sale last
Friday when cadets received from
their battery commanders an al-
lotted number of tickets. The as-
sessment for the ball has been
placed at $3.00, a price which the
committee believes will place the
dance within the means of every
student on the campus. Dancing will
last from ten until two o’clock, with
both sections of the ballroom being
utilized to accommodate the large
attendance which is anticipated by
committee members.

Several orchestras have been un-
der consideration since the plans for
the lvlilitary Ball were first set in
motion. The ﬁnal selection of the
music for the ball will be announced
by the committee chairman probably
within the next week or ten days.

A contest between batteries of
the R. O. T. C. is now in progress
in connection with the sale of tick-
ets for the ball. The battery sell-
ing the greatest number of tickets
will receive a silk “excellence”
guidon, bearing the seal of the
Coast Artillery worked in blue and
gold colors.

Results of the contest will be kept
posted on the Military department
bulletin board in the form of a
chart. The ﬁrst results will be
posted today, after cadets have
turri-ted in all sales for the past
wee .

A Math major wasn’t quite so ex-

15c for a shine, 25c for laundry, 60c
for a haircut, and $2.50 for a cor-
sage. That makes $13.10 for the
evening. Now if I tell her that the
ﬂorist must have wrecked his de-
livery truck, I'll save $2.50. And if
we go in Bob's Ford, I won’t have
to buy gas. And if I take Helen
we won't eat afterwards--she diets.
I could borrow a collar, bum cigar-

appreciation pf just what the Uni-
vensity of Pittsburgh was doing in
debating. The recognition they re-
ceived as representatives of Pitt
was extremely gratifying. On sev-
eral small campuses, the debaters
were approached by students who
were interested in Pitt basketball
teams and who wanted to know more
about the Cathedral of Learning.

team was accorded excellent treat-
ment throughout the trip. In most
cases they were driven both to and
from trains, and after being in-
stalled _in sleeping pquarters were
entertained by faculty members and
student delegates.
No Prejudices
“With the possible exception of
two schools,” Murphy stated, “we
were fortunate in debating before
audiences. that displayed no preju-
dices against us merely because we
opposed the .‘home team.’ ” He said
that in oneinstance their opponents
were astonished that ‘the Pitt men
should desire an audience vote on
the question, and frankly conceded
them no chance with an audience
which, they said. would undoubtedly
vote fox-_the home team,‘ purely out
of principle. The audience, how-’
ever, favored_ the Pitt men when a
change of opinion vote was taken.
A similar tribute to the prowess
of the Pitt debaters was revealed
by the vote of the Lion’s Club of
Omaha, favoring unemployment in-
surance, when Strauss and Jacobs
presented their arguments for the
adoption of such a. system in a de-
bate ‘before that group.
' Notre Dame Spirit . '
Coach Murphy and both of the
speakeIjs_ were  by the
fine spirit existing at Notre Dame.
where the Pitt men debated unem-
ployment insurance against two
Nobre Dame representatives. The
keenest nivalry of the trip was ex-
pected at the South Bend school.
After the recent defeat of the Notre
Dame basketball team by the Pitt
‘Panthers in a game that was
snatched out of the fire” in the last
mmutegof play, the team was also
expectant of same expression of hard
feelings on_ the part of the large
student audience at the debate.
The keen rivalry was there. ac.

of 59 _v~otee in favor of unemploy-

First Class Travel

The debaters, in their own words,
traveled “first class.” «In fact, Mr.
Murphy said that leaving Fargo, N.
D., they enjoyed privacy
their own Pullman, the car '. a
special coach‘ attached to a s

' ' freight that was bound for points

east. During the night the freight
train disposed of their private car
somewhere east of the Mississippi
River, and they were later picked
up  a fast passenger train which

carried them to their destination.
The meeting of the association
was brought to an impressive climax
with the presentation of a gift from
the team to Edward T. Crowder, Jun,
Col. ’31. Men’s_deba.te manager, who,

suited to their needs and talents.

The program arranged for this
year will differ from that of other
years, when the activities were rep-
resented in tableau or by pageantry.
Heinz House will be transformed
into an old-fashioned book store, and
each activity will be represented by
a book;

Members of the activities commit-
tee of W. S. G. A. who will be in

Seven Women Form
Dental Fraternity

The second gathering of the
newly formed dental fraternity for
women, Phi Beta Tau, was held last
Monday.

The fraternity is being organized
by the seven undergraduate women
now attending the Dental School,
after having been inactive for six
years, since 1925. ‘

Phi Beta Tau was first formed
as a local in 1923. In 1925 it went
national as Epsilon Alpha, Theta
chapter. Because of lack of interest
on the part of the alumnae, aside
from the pressing ﬁnancial reasons,
it soon became, an inactive chapter,
and went out of existence.

This year there h 3 been growing
interest s wn for organizing by
the presen dental students who
have, in turn, succeeded in arousing
the attention of the alumnae. There
are approximately 16 or 18 women
dentists in the Pittsburgh vicinity
who are alumnae and they, together
with the seven active members of
Phi Beta Tau, hope to become na-
tional again this coming spring.

 

Language Fraternity

Hears Spanish Talk

Mrs. Joseph, orriolis, wife of the
Spanish consul f Pittsburgh and a
professor at Duquesne University,
was fie speaker at the monthly din-
ner meeting of Sigma Kappa Pm,
national honorary language frater-
nity, last Tuesday at the Y. M. H.
A., Belleﬁeld avenue.

She discussed some of the prob-
lems of Spain, particularly those
arising from the desire of the peo-

le o-f Catelonia to introduce their
an-guage i_nto the University of
Barcelona, and into other parts of
Spain. She stressed the psycholog-
ical aspect of the study of other na-
tions and suggested that the Span-
iard’s gireatesrt contribution is his
ability to feel aesthetic pleasures
very intensely.

In the business meeting which
followed, Corrine Franz, Ed. ’3 ,
was elected treasurer to ﬁll the
vacancy left by the graduation of
Emily Lociga, Ed. ’311/2. Nomina-
tions were made for national presi-
dent and further plans for the open
house meeting were discussed. An-
nouncements of this will be made
sometime in April.

Gleemen 'G'etRadio Honor;
Plan Spring Concert Tour

The University Glee Club has
gained national recognition 
year with the announcement of its
inclusion in the Nuaitional Broad-
casting Company’s “Big Ten.” This
“Big Ten” is composed of the _ten
leading college clubs in the United
States. The local club will repre-
sent som-e large concern over the air.
Details of the broadcast are to be
disclosed shortly. _

Last year when the glee club sang
before the Wilson College for Wom-
en, at Chambersburg, a college
which has sponsored nationally‘
known glee clubs from Harvard.
Princeton, Yale, Johns Hopkins and
other large universities, it was re-
ceived with loud acclaim. At the
conclusion of the concert, music
critics proclaimed the Pitt Glee Club
as the best college glee club they
had heard, and in their rating placed
Pitt ﬁrst, ., Harvard second and
Princeton third. '

The itinenary of the club has
been tentatively completed by Percy
A. Rowland, Col. ’31, manager. The
ﬁi-st concert will be given at the
Methodist Church at Elbensburg.

From there the gleemen will go to
Somerset, Meyersdale and Cumber-
land where they will sing for va-
rious organizations, spending a day
in each place. Their next stop-over
will be at Washington, D. C., where
they will sing for the Washington
Auditorium Company. While at
Washington, the glee club will vis-

Regstration  
Shows Gain

All Schools Except Colleges
Have Larger Enrollment

Increase in the enrollment of sec-
ond semester students of this year
over the second semester students
of last year is indicated in all
schools except the college in the
comparative registration tables pre-
pared’ by Mr. J. Gil Quick, Uni-
versity registrar. T is report, taken
from the customary recount of reg-
istration cards, deals only with the
graduate and undergraduate schools
of_ the University. The ﬁgures per-
tain only to last year's and ..this
year’s second semester registrations.

The total of new freshman stu-
dents last year was 162; this year
an increase of 2 boosts the total to
164. On the other hand, while there
were 394 new studentsof all classes
enrolled last year, this semester
there are only 79. The grand total
of all graduate and undergraduate
students of the entire University
lastyear was 4,732; this year the
ﬁgure has climbed to a grand total
of 4,911. The increase is 179.

Comparative registrations for
each of the schools in the Univer-
sity are as follows: in the college
enrollment decreased from 1,795 to
1,758. Registration increased in
each of the other ﬁve schools. The
engineering school’s ﬁgures are 435
for last year and 555 for the pres-
ent year; in the school of mines, 98
and 117; in the school of business,
administration, 621 and 639' the
school of education, 849  860,
3261 the graduate school, 849 and

The school with the greatest in-
crea-se in enrollment is the school, of
engineering which has increased by
120 students. The lowest increase
is in the school of education with
a new enrollment of 11. The col-.
lege is the only school showing a de-
crease in enrollment, coming 37 . stu-
dents under last year's record.

FRANK TOTINO, of Totinofs

students who are entering profes_-

plenty about taking photographs.
His prices are moderate, too.

And it is not only the dinners that

attributes his achievement to that

saving now? Start an account at

Are We Social Lions?

HE INTENSIVE SURVEY’ of campus so-
cial activities and social organizations as
planned by Student Relations committee of
Student Council, for purposes of ascertaining
just how much effort, time and money is ex-
pended on these affairs, commands respect. ’
There are many students who maintain that.
the social calendar this year has been much
overcrowded and uphold their contention by
pointing out that there have been six general
Unixfersity dances since the ﬁrst of the year.
This total does not include private dances of

Prom to be held tonight.
That the dances have all been fairly success,-_
ful ﬁnancially, is admitted but the question is

placed on this side of campus life.

The investigation of the Student Relations
group -will no doubt be conducted thoroughly
and with no other motive than to obtain. un-
biased facts. There can be no action until the
background is obtained,» but there are many
who hold that the ﬁndings of the survey will

F or N ewShow

“Alice - Sit - B‘y - The-- Fire”
Chosen for Spring Play

 

The next production of the Pitt
Players will be “Alice-Sit-By-the-
Fire” by George Bernard Shaw,
was announced by Mr. Carl B. Cass,
director of the Players, at a dinner
meeting last Tuesday evening, in the
Carnegie Museum Cafeteria. The
suggestion was made that the sen-
l0I‘S be given the preference in the
casting of this play since they will.
not have an opportunity to take
part in a Pitt Player production
again.

Short speeches were.made by Mr.
Cass, William Young, Eng. ’31,
business manager, and. John Hairp-
ster, Col. '31, and John St. Peter,
Col. '31. _

It was also decided to hold the
customary dinner immediately after
the play‘ on the stage instead of be-
fore the presentation ofthe play.

Last night, the Players produced
their second big play of the year,
when they presented Walter Hack-
ett’s fantasy, “Captain, Applejack,”
under the direction of Mr. Cass.

The cast was headed by Clarence
Sober, Dent. '31, who played the’
part of Ambrose Applejohn, and
also the blood-thirsty. , pirate cap-
tain, Captain Applejack. The femi-
nine lead, the part of Poppy Faire,
was played by Elaine Blauvelt, C01.

The other members of the cast
-were: Aunt Agatha, Mary Agnes
Vichestain, Col. '31; Anna Valeska,
Barbara. Ann Hartman, Col. ’33;
Mrs. Pengard, Ruth Drum, Col. '34;
Horace Pengard, Roy Mag-ram, Col.

lor, Spec.

Stage affects were the work of
the technical staff. Howard J.
Stephens, stage manager, was as-
sisted by Kent MeMillan. The tech-
nical manager was N. R. Seidle.
Dana Burdette, assisted by Robert
Campbell, had charge of the elec-
trical affects. Production‘ manager

Using “The American Levia-

as a point of departure, Mrs. Ken-

of the League of Women Voters, ex-
plained the part women can take
in reform and politics to the Read-

Bartholomew, Woodwell street.

As an example of national prob-
lems, Mrs. Gould used the Muscle

of the United States into the World
Court. She discussed the city man-
ager plan of Pittsburgh as a local
problem, and then went on to ex-

Since the history of the United States is being related in 500 words
it is appropriate that this space tell the brief history of the University
of Pittsburgh. Pitt is not much younger than the U. S. but its experiences
have been fewer. With this in view we present the ﬁrst brief history of
Uni, to be emblazoned on the roof of _Upper Dent:

Nineteen hundred and eight, University founded. Student body up in
air. Final exams inaugurated. Student body up in air. German introduced
to curriculum. Student body up in air. Tuition raised. Student body up in
air. Defeated by Carnegie Tech. Student body up in air. Nineteen hundred
and thirty, Department of Aviation founded for student body.

Marty Strohm, one of the gems of
the Soph class, tells us of a boy that
calls her on the phone every night
in the week. “Why,” says Marty,
“he phones-even twice some nights.”

Well, well, Marty, dahling, all we
can say is beware of this boy. Any-
body who calls that often must be
phoney.

Players Score In Presentation  
Of English Piratical Fantasy

 

Avast there, ye lubbers!
A frenzied mob of mutinous pirates,

a
Aces, all Aces!

With these three words the cur-
tain rang down last night on “Cap-
tain Applejack,” the sparkling Ara-
bian Night's adventure presented‘ by
Pitt Players as their second surprise
of the season.

It was all the title of the play
might connote to you. -A glamorous
yarn of adventure and romance, a
tale of the fearless, hardened pirate.
And it all happened amid the quiet
charm of an old English home——the
ancient domicile of the Applejohns.

Clarence Sober was the current
counterpart of that much-revered
family. He was Ambrose Applejohn,
a middle-aged Englishman who sud-
denly tired of the clock-like regular-
ity of his daily routine, the undis-
turbed tranquility of his entire life-
He was bored, hog-:-lessly bored.

customary quiet of the Applejohn
home. The dancer tells her thrilling
experience, she is ﬂying from the
Russian spy, Borolsky (John St.
Peter). Ambrose encounters the arch
villain he had hoped to meet.
Burglars pry into the home and are
frightened away in the midst of
their operations. A secret panel is
discovered, an old parchment . , .
and the startling revelation is made
that the Applejohns are, after all,
not a. respectable family but one
founded by a notorious pirate, Cap-
tain Applejack.

The ﬁnal act reveals that Am-
brose, in spite of all, does come from
a respectable family, that the Rus-
sian dancer and the spy are no more
than crooks. They have been lured
to the Applejohn mansion in hopes
of securing a treasure which is not
really in existence. The parchment
was only a ruse of the scheming
Johnny Jason (George Taylor) con-
cealed in the house so that it might
ﬁtract buyers and facilitate the sale
of the home. ' '

By P acts, Inquiry
Speaker States ‘

 

“Economic problems, like the
present depression, must be dea-_1t
with by economic facts and economic
solutions, objectively approached.
without emotional bias,” declared Dr.
R. S. Watkins, professor and head
of the department of business re-
search at the weekly meeting of the
Inquiry Club last Wednesday.

Dr. Watkins was introduced to the
group by S. Clayton Newman, Col.
'31, president of the Y. M. C. A., in
the absence of Elmer Gettys, Bus.
Ad. '31, club's regular president. Dr.
Watkins spoke to a representative
group of students and faculty mem-
bers and emphasized his points by
graphs. ' ‘ . . _...-I

Lack Courage '

“It is a reﬂection on our intelli-
gence and on our managerial ability
to have such a depression, continued
Dr. Watkins. “We are sensitive to
an evident situation, to the realities
of the breadline and the starving
mothers and children, and we
haven't the courage’ to work on pre-
ventive measures. ‘ There we. have
the managerial, social and economic
necessities to provide for continuous
employment.

“Our sentimental attitudes in this
respect are illogical. The problem of
the unemployed should be taken._care
of by the economic order and not by
the aroused charitable feelings of
the people. But then, we had this
same trouble ﬁfteen years ago and
we probably will be faced with the
s-ame problem" fifteen years from
now.”

Scores Communists

Dr. Watson scored the communis-
tic and anarchistic, elements as hav-
ing no effect whatever in the pres.-
ent unemployment situation. The
greatest decline, he noted, in indus-
trial production. and the longest dur-
ation of employment crisis, is in the
present depression. In October,
1929, we had the greatest decline in
the pricesof the stocks. -

“We, have experienced eight ma-
jor depressions,” he concluded, _“but
none of these has had the violence
of the present one. Pittstburgh, how-
ever, is better’ off than- most cities,
showing eleven per cent less in em-
ployment and twenty—one per cent
less in payrolls, while the conditions

Pitt T raclz Team 
By Mid-Semester. Exams]

Final examinations took their toll
among the Pitt varsity and fresh-
man track performers; and as a re-

. suit, the two teams which were
looked upon as being the creamcf
this district, now find themselves in

a rut.

, The varsity team is without’ a
 capable sprinter. Bill Miller, star
is of the freshman team of last year,
‘ dropped out of school last week;
‘while Woody Harris, runner-up to
Pete Bowen in the threedash events
‘ in the “Big Four” track meet last
year, was declared ineligible last
week and did not compete‘ in the
West. Virginia indoor meet on Sat-

urday. ’ _
Jerry Vitulla and Len Monheim,
two lettermen from last year’s_ vat-
sity team, will carry the sprinting
burden for the Panthers, but due to
i their sl-.ight‘bui1d, neither can be ex-

‘ Monday from the meeting of the

-statement that hardly any changes
have been made in the code which

The committee, following the opin-
‘l°ﬁ 01’ the majority of coaches in
the country, decided to allow the

The players are evidently stale, and they heaved a sigh of

This rest may do much

to help the players and put them in

the right frame of mind for their coming-encounter with-Penn

The case of West Virginia. is a. funny one, for although the Moun-

taineers may play like

“chumps”, throughout their season,

they are al-

ways “on” when they face Pitt. Last year, the Mountaineers last four

out of ﬁve games

played on a trip through New York, and then they re-

turned to Morgantown and defeated Pzitt which up to that time had but

one defeat to mark its record.

As a result of this condition, West Virginia is the most feared of the

team remaining on the Pitt schedul

e; and it would not be surprising to

this writer were the rangy Mountaineers to hand Pitt another lacing.

City College of New York, by the way, has lost four games
this season, and one of these defeats was administered by Ford-

ham which showed poorly at the

stadium when Pitt defeated its

team in a listless game to the tune of 22-14.

If the system of checks and balances which are much talked
of in political science courses were used in the case of the Pitt
basketball team, the Panthers would show a perfect record for

their season to

Opening Games

The members of the interfra.-

their season last Tuesday with Phi
Delta Theta, S. A. E., and‘Sigma
Chi winning their tilts.

The PIh_1'- Delts beat the Omega
Delta ﬁve after four ex-tra. periods
of play. The ﬁnal score was 15-11.
0’de1l, frosh football and track star,
played best‘ for the winners while
scoring 11 -of his team’s points. Kas-
per scored eight points for the
losers. Covert of Omega Delta suf-

fered a broken nose in the first quar-

ter but ﬁnished the game.

Sigma Alpha. Epsilon had little
trouble downing Phi Epsilon Pi, 16-8.
Charley Miller, grid player, and
B-engston lead the scorin. , dividing
16 points evenly between t emselves.

. Forfeit Game

Sigma Pi won over Sigma Chi,
16-8, but forfeited the game when
they used an incl-igible man. Reed
scored- eight points to lead the
scorers.

In League B, Kappa Sigma, Phi
Kappa, and Sigmva Alpha Mu won
over Delta Tau Delta, Lambda, Chi
Alpha and Theta Kappa Nu, respec-
tively. The game between S. A. M.
and Theta Kappa Nu was the most
uneven contest of . the season, the
ﬁnal score being 45-1. Alpern scored
nine ﬁeld goals.

Theta Kappa Nu withdrew from
the loop following last night's en-
counter, and their place will be ﬁlled
by Delta Sigma Phi which was or-
igin-ally listed as the seventh mem-
ber of League C, the‘ only league
containing more than six teams.

No Replay

Inasmuch as Delta. Sigma Phi
would have had to forfeit their open-
ing game for late registration of
their players, they will not be per-
mitted to play S. A. M. in this sec-
tion, and the game will «be forfeited
to the Sammies. Phi Gamma Delta
forfeited its game last nig t in sec-
tion C to Theta Chi_ for the same
reason. —

Next week's games in section A
will be between Omega. Delta and
Phi Epsilon Pi, the Phi Delts and
Sigma Chi, and Sigma -Alpha Epsi-
lon and Sigma Pi.

In section B, Delta Tau Delta
faces Lambda Chi Alpha, S. A. M.
meets Kappa Si 21, and Phi Kappa
opposes Delta igma Phi. ,

Due to the switching .of Delta Sig-
ma Phi to another section, the games
to be played in section C are not
yet deﬁnite.

Pitt Breaks Even
On Eastern Trip

Pitt’-s Carlson-less» cagers broke
even in the two games played on
their annual trip to New York. The
Army was defeated last Saturday by
a 36-32 count, but City College of
New York surprised Pitt with an 18-
16 setback. I

The Army game was close
throughout the ﬁrst half with the
lead changing many times before
the half ended with the Army ahead,
20-19. Pitt obtained the lead soon
after the start of the second half
and they never relinquished, al-
though the Mules cut it down some-
Zwlrhattowards the close of the bat-

e

That victory, however, took its
toll, and although the Panthers
gained a 14-5 lead on Net Holman’s
passers in their encounter the fol-
lowing Monday, Pitt was unablerto
maintain the same pace in the sec-
ond half and consequently dropped
their fourth game of the season.

 Hayman, Kat: of Syracuse
Named on Team

E. Milton Cohen, an outstanding
,member of the Pitt basketball team
r the past three seasons, was
named on the All-Jewish basketball
team picked by George Joel, well-
known New York sports writer. Co-
hen was placed at a guard post.

Two players who appeared on the
stadium court this season on an op-
position team, were also named on
Joel’s team. These two players
are Hayman and Ev Katz, both of
Syracuse; Hayman is a forward and
Katz is a guard.

' Joel Comments

Commenting on his selections,
Joe} said: “Just to prove how lit-
tle I care about trouble, I am set-
ting down for your armoyance and
perusal an All-Jewish basketball
team. You will notice that only six
colleges are represented on the
team, but that is because I think
that these teams have by far the
best teams and the best records. I
have seen all of these boys in ac-
tion and am-ready to defend my
choices with plentiful detail.”

The full selection follows:

Hayman, Syracuse, forward

Bender, Columbia, forward

Shuckman, St. John’s, forward

Posnack, St. John’s, center

Cohen, Pittsburgh, guard

Katz, Syracuse, guard

Horowitz, Yale, guard. '

Unknown Lion Team

In a pre-I.imIinarv to the main
tilt, George Kowalrlis’ Panther cubs
meet the Penn State freshmen to-
morrow night. Not much is known
of the Lion cubs, but they are ex-
pected to put up a hard battle.

The Penn State frosh play only
four or ﬁve games a year, and al-
ways come to the stadium primed.
Last year the Lion cubs went down
to defeat after a hard battle. and
they are eager for revenge.‘

The Pitt freslnnen, having lost
more games than any other Panther
frosh team that has been under the
tutelage of George Kowallis, are
anxious to make a good impression
on their coach by winning the rest
of their games.

Bryde and Hunt will line up at the
forward positions, Ochsenhirt at
center, and Hughes pairing up with
McBride at the guards. Captain Don
Macamant will not play for the rest
of the season due to illness. Beck,
who has been playing a good game
in a relief role, will probably break
into the encounter. Harapas and

BY DAVID '1‘. ROGERS
_The new Inter-fraternity cham-
pions of Pitt, Delta Sigma Phi, nar-
rowly -avoided being a poor “also-

ran” in the bowling matches which

were completed Thursday night,
February 12.

A mysterious telephone message,
to the effect that the playoff match
between Sigma Alpha Mu and Delta
Sigma Phi for the championship of
Section C of the league had been
canceled, was received by Clarence
Rogers, 3. member of the Delta Sig
team, at the Delta Sig house the
day before the match was to have
been played.

Thought Neidig Called

The now mysterious caller ex-
plained to Rogers that the reason
for the postponement was the fact
that Interfraternity Council was to
hold its monthly meeting the next
evening, Tuesday, February 10, and
that the scheduled bowling match
would have to be pushed back until
Wednesday. Rogers, unaware of
trickery, and thinking the voice of
the opposite end of ‘the wire to be
that of Harry Neidig, Dent. ’31, a
member of Interfraternity Council’s
bowling committee, heard the story,
and said, “0.K., Neidig,” and hung
up the receiver. He then informed
the other members of the team that
the match was off until Wednesday
night. _

The Sigma Alpha Mu boys, hav-
ing had no such message, put in
their scheduled appearance at the
Craig and Center Alleys, and waited
in vain for the opposition to “show
up.” After it became evident that

the Delta Sigma Phi team was not

coming, -a member of the S. A. M.
team called and informed the Delta
Sig who answered the phone that
his team had forfeited the match
and as a. result was out of the race.

The next day, Wednesday, Delta
Sigma Phi, unable to understand
whether they or Sigma Alpha Mu
had become twisted -over the date,

ystferioasl  SCI

Champs

took the matter to the office of As-
sistant Dean of Men Biddle.
Biddle was surprised to hear that
Delta Sigma Phi had been the re-
cipient of a telephone call cancel-
ing the match. He stated that no
such call had come from his office.
Rogers then reported that he be-
lieved the caller to have been Nei-
dig. When questioned, however,
Neidig denied all knowledge of the
matter.

S. A. M. Approves

The Delta Sig boys now convinced
that somebody had played them 3. vi-
cious trick appealed for the right
to meet Sigma Alpha Mu in actual
competition. Mr. Biddle declined to
become the umpire and turned the
matter over to the bowling commit-
tee, composed of Eddie Jacobs, Art
George and Harry Neidig. These
men realized that Delta Sigma Phi
had a good case but
thought that S. A. M. should have
a word in the matter. As a result.
Sigma Alpha Mu was given the facts
of the case and at the same time
informed that if they consented to
meet the Delta Sig team they
would have to do so that same eve-
ning-——which meant that the winner
of the match would be required to
meet Phi Kappa in the semi-finals
immediately following the conclu-
sion of their match. The Sigma Al-
pha Mu boys showed their excel-

lent sportsmanship by consenting to I

go through with that arrangement.
The matches on Wednesday re-
sulted in the defeat of Sigma Al-
pha Mu in two straight games. Phi
Kappa, representing Section B,
also dropped from the race after a
hard three-game match, in

next two. The championship match
on Thizrsday, February 12, found
Delta’ Sigma Phi crashing through
the much-favored Sigma Chi outﬁt
towin the cup, but only after the
most bitterly contested battle of the
season.
