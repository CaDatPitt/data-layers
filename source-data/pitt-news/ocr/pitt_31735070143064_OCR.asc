Matthew Lynas reiterated a 

demand to listeners at the G—2O Sum— ‘

“I declarethistobeanunlawful as-

sembly. You must leave,-” he said.

. He saidthatpolice had no more au-
thority to disperse people than he did.
But he didn’t blame the police.

‘ “Eundamentallytheblame lieswith
us,”he said “Atwhatpoints did govem—
ments think they could get away with
what they did?” '

Lynas, acamegie MellonUniversity
junior from Glasgow, Scotland, joined
the Pitt students, representatives of the
anti-wargroupThomas Merton Center,"
and other members of the community

Aboutlso people gatheredtoliste
to testimonies ab'out‘;the demonstra-
tions in Oakland1astThursday and Fri-
day night. Many of them wore black,

arms, symbolizing the bruises people
received from the police, as well as Pitt
pride.

Nathan Lanzendorfeor, 23, from _

Mt. Lebanon, didn’t wear the ribbons.

He wore black and blue on the backiof

hislegs and onhisupper arm. V
Lanzendorfeor said police shotrub—

said four bullets struck him, leaving a

palm—sized bruise on the ‘back of his 4

left leg. ;

Genevieve Redd, president ofPitt’s
ACLU student group, said she was
pleasedwithtiiepeacefulevent, though
some people made the event partisan
bycallingforMayorLukeRavenstahl’s
impeachment. The group plans totable
in Towe_rs lobby to get more people to
sign petitions.

Thereweretwo petitions with iden-

tical wording, but one was on behalf '

of Pitt students and the other on be-

petitions call for Student Government '

The newbeige food storage containers
intheW1lliamPittUnion’sSchenleyCafé
might notbe as “green” as they look.

Sodexo, Pitt’s contracted food
service company, bought new food
storage containers, plates and 100-
percent recycled napkins to be more
environmentally responsible.

Eric Beckman, Pitt professor and
co—director of the Mascaro Sustain-
ability Initiative, said that being envi-
ronmentally friendly is relative to the
various stages of a product’s life.

“[Eco-friendly product makers]
are showing you the report card, but

they’re not always showing you" all

the grades,” he said. “There’s no such
thingas ‘green’ in an absolute sense.”

Schenley Café, operated by the
food service company Sodexo, elimi-
nated the polystyrene plates — think
the generic equivalent of Styrofoam
— in its Culinary Classics section in
favor of sturdier, heavier paper-like
plates. A

But Beckman said that weight is a
general indicator ofhow much energy
went into making a product.

“More weight is bad. It’sjust more
stuffthathadto becreated.Thattook

emphasizing that pollution caused
by transporting products‘ is among
the most harmﬁrl environmental of-
fenses. " A ‘

By this measure, the light polysty-
rene plates are better than a heavy,
“green” equivalent.

Many plastic and polystyrene —
whichisbasicallyanair-puifedtype of
plastic —— containers are recyclable,
butthis process often is not cost effec-
tive, Beckmansaid.

Thoughpolystyrenehasabadrep-
utation for being slow to biodegrade,
Beckman said that it doesn’t matter

‘whether a single-use plate is made of

polystyrene or dense paper in a land-
ﬁll where there isn’t enough oxygen

forthe platestobreak down. ,
The Environmental Protection

Agency’s website saysthatlandﬁll gas, ’

by volume, consists of about 50 per-
cent methane and 50 percent carbon
dioxide and water vapor. There are

very small amounts of oxygen, nino- —

gen, hydrogen and non-methane or-
ganic compounds.

In a compost, where there’s lots of
oxygen and bacteria, thepaper prod-
uctwould biodegrade easily. ’

Sodexo traded in the large, clear
plastic to-go containers for light, Ba-
gasseware containers at the start of
the fall semester. These containers are

composed of plant ﬁbers, including

The new policy stems from dozens

the new rule has its uses, it restricts a

To the Editor,

It continues to astound me how
Giles Howard has made a complete
180fnombeingPresidentObama’s big-
gest cheerleaderandachampion ofthe
American Left to suddenly espousing
neo-conservatism in all its misguided
glory-

His latest column, “Obama mishan-
dling Iran,” which ran on Sept. 30, is
nothingshortofsilly. The entire column
is arehash of American exceptional-
ism: America must shake its ﬁnger at
Iran for their rigged elections and
weapons-oriented nuclear program.
America also should be “engaging 
pro-democracy activists and aiding
them in their attempt to establish a
true Iranian republic.”

Haven’t we meddled in the Middle

comes to other nations.

There are myriad issues regarding
liberty that need attention right here
inthe United States beforewe caneven
consider admonishing other nations.
A greater adherence to the Constitu-
tion would go along way in resolving
these issues. Moreover, such adherence
would help America realize that it has
no power to meddle in other nations’
aﬂ"airs.Thisisnotacallto isolationisrn.
Itisobvious thatthe rise of globalization
makes interaction with other nations
necessary and even unavoidable. How-
ever, let us recall Thomas _]eﬂ'erson’s
words: “Commerce with all nations,
alliance with none, should be our mot-
to.” Assuming that the people of other
nations have no idea how to govern
themselves is pure arrogance.

which parents actively expose their
children to the infection. In addition,
41 percent of respondents cited tales
of others’ bad experiences, while 26
percent thought the shot was ineffec-
tive. 'Iwenty—sevenpercentwere afraid
of needles.

And eventhoughvaccines for once-
pervasive diseases such as mumps,
measles, rubella and polio have nearly
eradicated the diseases ﬁom the West-
ern Hemisphere, an anti—vaccination
movement is making its way around
in 2009. ,

The mostprevalentmythwhich the
movement purports is that Th_imero-
sol, a preservative in some vaccines,
increases the riskofdevelopingautism.
Many of the “antivax” advocates cite
spikes in autism rates as proof of a
causal link. A

Others, such as noted porn star
and non-doctorjenny McCarthy, cite
personalstories of their children in-
stantaneously becoming autistic after
being vaccinated: “Boom, soul gone
ﬁomhis eyes,” McCarthy reportedto a
credulous Oprah Winfrey in 2007.

The medical community has thor-
oughly debunked this theory for years
——theincreaseinautismratescanbe
largely attributed to increased aware-

 

Céé“

ness and diagnosis ofthe condition, the
broadening of its criteria and possible
environmental factors.

Yet in addition to McCarthy, her
boyt'riend]imCarrey, comedian Bill Ma-
her, journalist David Kirby and Robert
E Kennedyjr. have all publicly decried
vaccines. Senatorjohn McCain. D-Ariz.,
stated early in his most recent presi-
dential campaign that “there’s strong
evidence’ ’ thatvaccines are responsible
for the rise in autism rates.

The anti—vaccination movement
is not exclusive to celebrities -— it has
existed since the 18th century.

NewYork recently became the ﬁrst
state requiring its health care workers
to receive the HJN1 vaccination, and
several hundred health care workers,
civil libertarians and anti—vaccination
proponents are all protesting the de-
cision.

One objection from an aide at a
Brooklyn medical center was that
“Some people’s immune system is
good, likeme.” .

A CDC report published last year
shows that measles — a vaccine-pre-

ventable illness —- are on the rise, and '

out of 130 reported cases in the ﬁrst
sevenmonths of2o08, onlyeightwere
vaccinated.

The physicians interviewed in the
report cited the fears of some parents
that the shot causes autism.

Some parents choose not to vacci-
nate their children on religious grounds,
citing reasons ﬁ‘om vaccines’ ‘ ' uri-

,” because of dietary restrictions and
because of the idea that “God doesn’t
use drugs.”Allbuttwo states — holla at
Mississippi and WestVirginia—- allow
kindergartnersto bypass vaccinations
on religious grounds.

Swine ﬂu isn’t the most serious ill-
ness aptfor immunization, butthe shot
isbeing released atamomentwhen vac-

Bonerama bring

All-trombone band fuzes rocking lyrics, musicalspecial effects and New Orleans swagger

-The words “Pittsburgh” and
“ftmk” are not used in the same
sentence very often, but a band na-A
tive to New Orleans hopes to change
that._]ust be careful when you search
its name on the Internet.

Bonerama plans to bring the
funk to the city on Oct. 3,‘when it
showcases at the Rex Theater. The
band labels its genre “brass funk
rock.” Take rocked-out lyrics, mix
in a little New Orleans funk, lead
it all with trombones and you get
Bonerama.

As for ﬁnding Bonerama online,
“You have to be careful where you
search on the Internet for us,” said
co-founder Craig Klein. “You can
come across some eye—openers.”

While mindsmight sink to the
gutter, Klein said that the band’s
name comes from his instrument
of choice: A trombone is known as
a “bone” in music terminology.

When Klein and Mark Mullins
founded the band in 1998, they
were fresh off a tour with Harry

Connickjr. (“P.S. I Love You,” “New
in Town”).

“Mullins and I had always
dreamed of putting a trombone
band together, so we did,” he said.
A little over a decade later, Bonera-
ma had released three live albums,
toured the nation and opened eyes
to New Orleans culture.

“New Orleans is one of the mec-
cas of music in the world,” Klein

Said-A . . ._ 
Music and culture go handlin

hand for Bonerama, and the band
would like to bring that mentality
to Pittsburgh.

“Music has been a part of the
culture of New Orleans for hundreds
of years. Music is part of life in New
Orleans. We celebrate life with mu-
sic. We celebrate death with music,”
he said.

A steady, uphill climb embodies
Bonerama’s 11-year lifespan. That
climb, according to Klein, is no-
where close to being ﬁnished.

Bonerama recently dropped its
third live album, “Hard Times,” and
is currently promoting it with a tour

' in the Northeast. Tour stops include‘

Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., Burl-
ington, Vt. and Sullivan Hall in New
York. “We’re really excited about
playing there,” Klein said of Pitts-
burgh’s Rex Theater. “We did a little
research on it, and it turns out it is

over 90 years old and the sounds
are great in there. We love playing

You have to belcareful
where you search on 

Craig Klein

in places like tha .” , , t
A legacy like Rex Theater’s is
what Klein hopes for the future of
Bonerama. ~
“We’re in the studio now record-
ing our ﬁrst real studio album,” he

said. “This new record is going to be ‘

a pretty intense studio effort.
“With the rich heritage that we
have here [in New Orleans], we sort
of feel like we’re trying to put our
own little taste on it,” he'said. O
This “taste” includes a band
member playing his horn through
a guitar ampliﬁer so that it sounds
exactly like an electric guitar —
shredding included. The electric
guitar feel adds more rock ap-
peal.
' “We also do a lot of vocals, but

the three trombones are the voice
of the band,” Klein said. '

And-with those leading bones
comes the ﬁmk.

Funk-rock, like any other genre,
comes at a price. i

“The whole music industry
has totally changed,” Klein said.
“There’s not support from record‘
labels anymore. You’re on your
own.” In search of a way to keep do-
ing whatthey -love, the bandecfreated

For example, with a, $50 dona-

new Bonerama music.

With a $500 donation, fans re-

ceive unrestricted access to two live
online concerts from the studio dur-
ing the production of the new CD.

Klein and fellow members of
Bonerama are pleased with the re-
sults of the Boner Donor program
thus far.

“It helps support our art and
keeps the music coming. It’s also a
way for us to get to know our fans.
It’s an interesting idea, and we’ll see
where it goes,” he said.

 - Pittsburgh-is not just a-small stop
on a multi—city tour for Bonerama.
Instead, the city serves as a semi-

. milestone. As it is the band’s ﬁrst

time performing here, it is excited
to meet, play for and educate fans

' in Pittsburgh.

“We know that if they come out

i and hear it, they’re going to like it.

They’re going to have a good time.
That’s a track record of ours. We
just want to share our music with
them,” he said.

Boldly going where no toys have gone before

Disney-Pixar blockbusters “Toy Story” and “Toy Story 2” rocket off the screen in new 3-D releases

Patrick Wagner
For The Pitt News

“Toy Story in 3-D” .
Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Don Rick-
les ' '

' Directed by: John Lasseter

Pixar Animation Studios
Grade: B

What makes a good story? It’s not something
fantastical, leye:catchingor elaborate, but rather,
it’s about individuals exploring the human condi-
tion together, whether they realize it orinot.

Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear
(Tim Allen) begin as rival toys ﬁghting for the
affecI1'on of an average boy and end bybecoming
friends. This simple story line keeps Disney and

Pi3(ar’s “Toy Story” relevan’ ‘t aﬁer'13"years."“ ” ’

The animation is relatively primitive com-
pared to recent Pixar productions, but the inter-
action between the toys remains timeless.

Overall, the movie is a lot less cheesy than
you’d expect, and experiencing Woody and
Buzz’s arrogance is as entertaining and relevant
in college as it was in grade schooL

Olderviewerswillﬁnd greater depthinplen-
ty of things that are probably lost on Disney_’s
target demographic.

From a mature perspective, one seemingly
terﬁfying scene involving “The Claw” echoes the

psychological terror ofThe Twilight Zone rather
than an innocent aside to the main story.

The re-release is heralded as an irnprove—
ment with the addition of 3-D, but it eventually
reveals itselfto be a bit of a gimmick.

Thisﬁlmwas not made for3-.D, and its retro-
ﬁtting isn’t particularly revolutionary or allthat
interesting.

While it’s amusing to watch Woody pop out
ofthe screen, my mind simply puts himback on
a two-dimensional surface.

It’s a more “embossing” than “pop-out
book” effect, and it’s ultimately superﬂuous to
the rest of the movie. ' 4

When the ﬁrst “Toy Story” came out, it was

When the more technologically advanced
“Toy Story 2” came out, itwas metwith thesame
— if not more — critical acclaim. Both movies
are classics. '

Both movies deserve your time. The ques-
tion is, does the 3-D merit a second (or third,or
fourth) watch?

Probably not. Since “Toy Story 2” was not
originally intended to pop out of the screen, the
3-D overdub is only marginally more engaging.

( Most of the scenes have a slight sense of di-’
mension——enoughtowowsmall childrenbutnot

There are a couple
shots, however —— a
truck careening into our
faces and Buzz Lightyear

to make movies real in
the most literal sense.

Pitt and Louisville are looking to
rebound tonight during their lock-
up at Papa]ohn’s Cardinal Stadium.
The Panthers are looking to shake off
the after—effects of a second-halfcol—
lapse against North Carolina State,
and the Cardinals are looking to get
their entire football program back
on track. ‘ 5

, The Cardinals are 1—7. in their .1

last eight contests, their lone win

0‘ coming Sept. 5 against the now 0-5

Indiana State Sycamores. Despite
its recent struggles, Louisville has
still managed to sell out its home sta-

dium for tonight’s ESPN2 national.

broadcast. . -

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt ex-
pects the Louisville crowd will gen-
erate an unfriendly atmosphere.

The Panthers haven’t won a game in

at Louisville since 19 83.

“It’s goingto be very, verytough,” _

Warmstedt said. “They’re going to
have afull house, and it’s going to be
an enthusiastic full house, you can
bet on that. We’ve got to do a good
job of not being distracted as a team
and keeping our focus on the job at
hand.”

Some people in Louisville are ,

looking at tonight’s contest as a must-
win game. Another poor showing
_in Big East play could spell doom
for third-year Cardinal coach Steve
KI‘agt.h0rPe- -
“We’re deﬁnitely in a position
where we need to win this football
game. It’s a big game for us. It’s on
national television. It’s [our] ﬁrst Big
East conference game,” Kragthorpe
said. “There’s no doubtthis is a game
that’s very important to us.”
Kragthorpe is 0-2 in Big East
openers since leaving Tulsa in 2007.
Overall, his Big East record is 4-10.
On the other sideline, Wannst-
edt is looking for his team to make a
quick recovery after a disappointing
road trip last weekend. '
“This will be a big challenge for
our team. Number one, to bounce
back from last week’s game [and]
two, to go down there and play in
front of a very excited, hostile crowd
on a Friday night,” Wannstedt said.
Against North Carolina State, the
Panther defense gave up 530 yards
of total offense, and the Pitt offense

failed to convert a ﬁrst down in the
fourth quarter. Wannstedt said that
he is glad this week’s game is on Fri-
day instead of Saturday. Itwill get last
week’s game out of everyone’s mind
a day sooner.

“I’m just fortunate that last week
wasn’t our last game,” Wannstedt
said. ‘‘We’ve got another game this
week and we’ve got another opportu-
nity to go out and proveto ourselves
and our fans that we’re a good foot-

ball team.” , , V

  Asuccessful start to Big’-East-—
play would go a long way in replac— '

ing the memories of last Saturday’s
contest. ’
Pitt’s task will be to shut down

’ junior quarterbackjustin Burke and
V ‘talented sophomore running back

Victor Andersen. Burke is coming

- off mixed performance against Utah,

and Anderson has six 100-yard rush-
ing games in his career butwas held

1 to 22 yards last week.

The Panther defensewillalso have
to take advantage of a Louisville team
that turned the ball over three times
last week against the Utes. Up to this
point, the Panthers have forced seven
opposing team turnovers. Louisville
ranks last in the Big East, averaging

just 23.7 points a game. Pitt is third
at 37.5 points a game.

On offense, the Panthers could

look to run right by the Cardinals.
Louisville is last in the Big East in
rush defense, giving up 133.7 yards
a game. The Cardinals are second
in pass defense, though, giving up
just 154-"yards a game. The Panthers
might need another big weekfor
freshman’ Dion Lewis if they hope
to pull out the road win. ‘

Tonight, the opportunity for re-
demption will be presented to both
teams. Either Pitt will make up for
the victory that slipped through its

ﬁngers last week or Louisville will .

begin to recover from a prolonged
stretch of disappointment.
