Committee drafts Net restrictions

By John  Moore
and Kathleen Scanlon
The Pitt News

An ad hoc committee at
the University of Pittsburgh
has drafted a proposal
restricting some forms of
Internet pornography and has
passed the draft on for
administrative review.

The committee, made up
of students, faculty and staff,
agreed on a proposal on Dec.
16 and has forwarded it to

Senior Vice Chancellor for
Business and Finance Ben
Tuchi for approval.

Sociology professor
Norman Hummon, chair of
the ad hoc committee,
declined to specifically com-
ment on the restrictions.

According to Pitt Director
of Communications Ken
Service, the committee “has
developed a draft and it has
been passed on for adminis-
trative review.”

Service also said Pitt’s

decision on the restrictions
might be made as early 
the end of the month.

The committee was created
in November around the time

Women 's Studies course
_s_parks $udzma's passion

By Chris Kocher
Staff Writer

According to Stephanie
Sudzina, when she came to
Pitt, she agreed with women’s
issues like adequate funding
for breast cancer treatment and
equal pay for equal work, but
she didn’t really feel passion-
ate about them.

A meeting ﬂier and a first-

year writing course changed _

all that.

The course was General
Writing: Women’s Studies,
which examined the culture of
women using 20th-century
American literature.

“It was really kind of painful
for me to go through the whole
class because it was shattering

a lot of myths,” said Sudzina,
now co—president of Pitt’s
Campus Women’s
Organization. “For the first
time, someone had questioned
what I’d always thought was a
given. It was a big eye-open-
ing experience, but it hurt at
first to be confronted with all
these things I was doing in my
own life.”

The ﬂier, which she saw in
the bathroom of the Cathedral
of Learning, advertised CWO.

“[The ﬂier] said, ‘Are you
upset that when you graduate
college you’re going to be
making the same wages as a
male high school grad?’ It list-
ed all these different points,
and I really identified with a

By Mark Gordon

Asst. News Editor

Pitt’s undergraduate
business school, which
plans on teaching stu-
dents about money, is
having a hard time rais-
ing it.

The school is sched-
uled to open this fall
semester, and according
to Pitt Director of
Communications Ken
Service, the school will
open, only there will not
be a building designated
specifically for under-
graduate business admin-
istration.

“The plans to admit
students to the school
remain strong,” Service
said. “Two hundred and
twenty five students will
be admitted to the pro-
gram.”

To build a new build-
ing that will serve as the
business school will cost
around $21 million,
according to Service. and
currently Pitt has raised a
little over $1 million.

Dolin challen es norms
by donning s in‘ at Pitt

By Chris Kocher
Staff Writer

Scott Dolin enjoys challeng-
ing people’s perceptions and
beliefs.

Earlier in the term, for
instance, he put on a long black-
and-ﬂowered skirt and walked
around Oakland.

“On the shuttle down from
Sutherland, there was this
woman sitting on the bus, and
she was staring at me,” said
Dolin, co—president of Pitt’s
Campus Women’s
Organization. “Finally she was
like, ‘Why are you wearing a
skirt?”’

When he told her he wore it
because he wanted to and
because it was comfortable, she

became ﬂustered and insisted
he must have some reason for
wearing a skirt.

“I asked her, ‘Do you have a
reason when you wear a skirt?’
She said, ‘Well, I’m a girl,”’
Dolin said.

And although he said he
doesn’t drink, he said he never
had a greater urge to go into
Zelda’s bar than when he
walked past in the skirt and the
bouncer stared him down.

“I wanted to go up to him and
ask, ‘How much is the cover
tonight?”’ Dolin said with a
laugh. “Just to watch his face,
because that would have been a
hell of a lot of fun.”

He said he doesn’t understand
people’s reactions to a man in a

Students tend to spend
more money on alcohol

By Nicole Walz
Staﬁ’ Writer

Many students complain
they don’t have enough
money to do anything. Some
work part-time jobs and others
call home for money, but still
most students manage to find
weekly money for alcohol.

Senior Adam Kunselman
said the money he uses is
“whatever I have left over at
the end of the week.”

The amount students spend
each week varies. Junior Chris
Sommer said he usually spend
“probably 30 bucks  on hard
liquor and beer.”

“Ten dollars,’ said junior
Shelly Frank. “You’ll go [to a
bar] and meet a guy and he’ll
buy you a beer.”

Some students don’t drink
often, but will spend a lot
when they do.

“I don’t drink a lot. I drank
on my hayride about two
weeks ago and probably spent
25 dollars. But I haven’t drank
since,” said junior Kristi
Stein.

“I only spend money on

7

-. alcohol in bars when I go out

on the weekends,” said sopho-
more Jason Saleem. “I’ll
spend around 50 dollars 
that’s everything including
food.

Some students base which
bars they go to on thedrink
specials. Kunselman said,
“Most definitely. I look for
quantity over quality.”

Frank disagreed, “I go to

cccccccccccccc

bars I like, not for what they
havef’

When students don’t go to
bars and have their own par-
ties, there is still a small price
to pay. University Beverage
Center cashier David George
said on the.average, people
will spend anywhere from
nine to 17 dollars for a case of
beer. I

“If they are buying cheap
beer, rthey’ll spend as little as
nine. The better beers are
around 17,” George said. “It
about evens out. Maybe a few
more people buy the cheap
beer.”

“The busiest nights are
Friday and Saturday between
10 and 11 p.m. Also, about 2
a.m. when the bars close. We
call it the bar rush,” George
said.

All the students interviewed
said they wouldn’t sacrifice
other things such as rent, text-
books or phone bills to have
money for alcohol.

Senior Amy Wong said, “If
I started sacrificing things, I
think that would be the point
of an alcoholic.”

They also

said they

wouldn’t call home for money I

for the alcohol. Sommer said,
“I don’t ask my parents for
money.” .

Stein agreed, “I definitely
would not.”

“You don’t think people
would take it that much to
heart,” he said. “lt’s not them,
and if they don’t.want to do it,
they don’t have to do it. No
one’s forcing them to do it.”

Dolin has been challenging
similar reactions since he
became CWO’s first male co-
president last spring.

When he was elected, Dolin
said some wondered how a male
could lead a group dedicated to
women’s issues. A few people
asked Dolin if his motive was
getting dates. Others asked if he
was gay.

“I guess people had a rather
limited perspective of what I
could be doing,” Dolin said.

He never thought about pick-
ing up women through CWO,
he said. And “I’d have no prob-
lem ifl was gay, but I’m not
gay. I don’t understand how
being the head of a women’s
organization means that you are
automatically homosexual,” said
Dolin, who considers himself a
“radical feminist.”

But the majority of people
don’t appear ready to reject him
just because he’s male. '

“The overwhelming support
has been that if I’m capable of
doing the job, and if I’m inter-
ested in doing it, then they have
no problem with it,” he said.

Dolin, la second—year student
from Huntington, W.Va., is pur-
suing a triple major in English

writing, film studies and philos-
ophy, as well as certificates in

women’s studies and Asian V

studies. He hopes to finish in
four years by taking 18 or 19
credits a semester.

“I have to keep busy,” he 
“When I most enjoyed high
school was when I was busy.”

Although he has been interest-
ed in women’s issues since he
was “rather young,” it was in
high school that Dolin started to
wonder about the double stan-
dard around him.

“I remember in high school,
you had guys who call women
‘sluts’ and ‘whores’land things
like that, but they were the same
guys who would go out and
sleep with lots of women, then
come back and brag about it,”
he said.

“What makes you any better
than the people you’re con-
demning? And since you do the
same thing, what right do you
have to condemn them?” he
asks. ,

When he came to Pitt, he had
to attend the meetings of a stu-
dent organization as part of the

Emerging Leader program.
a When he read through a list of

groups, only CWO looked inter-
esting to him.

A year later he was running
CWO with fellow co-president
Stephanie Sudzina, trying to get
students involved.

“The more people you can get
to help, the more you can get
done,” Dolin said. “If Stephanie

and I have to do everything, it’s
going to take us a while to get it
together.” ,

He admits to being a bit puz-
zled by some people’s claims
that CWO is less “radical” this
year than in past years.

“If there’s something that we
have to get upset about and fight
over, we’re going to do it,”
Dolin said.

He said he thinks the percep- 8

tion of being less radical may
come from more willingness to

work with university officials ~

and the Student Government
Board.

‘‘If we need something, I’m
going to go ask them and work
with them to try and help us
out,” he said. “I think that’s
more productive than to just sit
back and bitch about it.”

He thinks it is important to
“diversify” the activities CWO
sponsors, “so each year we
don’t bring in the same lecturers
and have the same discussions,”
he said. “We try to keep it cur-
rent.”

Several projects have occu-
pied CWO’s time over the
semester, like pursuing reports
of a sexual assault on campus,

-starting a women’s studies

major at Pitt and implementing
an escort service.

“We both are_ really commit-
ted to the idea that an escort ser-
vice will work because it’s
worked with so many other
schools and it’s been very effec-
tive,” Dolin said.

“I finally had -to realize that
and had to tell myself that I
refuse to be that statistic any-
more. I couldn’t live with
myself and continue to be that
way.”

She said she wasn’t alone
having difficulty with what
people expected of her in col-
lege. _

“A lot of women come to
college with very, very low
self-esteem, and I think that’s
triggered a lot of times by
being forced to conform to a
mold of what an ‘attractive’
girl is, or whatever,” Sudzina
said. “I think it’s really sad
that it wasn’t until my 20s that
I finally became a critical
thinker. I used to accept things
all the time as ‘that’s just the
way it is,’ but it doesn’t have

almost afraid to say that they
came out and identified with
us. A lot of people are still
closed up in silence, and we
have to break that silence.”

Getting people to break
their silences and become
involved can be difficult, “but
I think a lot of people are with
us in spirit, and that makes me
very confident,” she said.

Sudzina said she doesn’t
believe CWO is less radical
this year than in previous
years, as some have suggest-
ed.

“I think that a lot of our tac-
tics are [less radical],” she
said. “This year we’re work-
ing with a lot of different
groups to try to get things
done rather than being overly
outspoken. Not that we’re not

really had to fight for these
things.”

Sudzina said she sometimes
gets discouraged when CWO
tries to do good but isn’t sup-
ported by the student body,
“but we’re dealing with it, and
there are a lot of people who
do support us.”

Now that she and co-presi-
dent Scott Dolin have their
bearings leading CWO,
Sudzina said, she is looking
forward to the spring term.

“This semester it was sort of
Scott and I fending for our-
selves in [the CWO] office

was tough because we really
didn’t have the connections.

access pornography on the
Internet.

In the same issue of The
Pitt News, Greg Musi, a

member of an information

science student group,
said even if some informa-
tion is banned from
Pitt’s server, users can
still access other
servers from throughout the
world.

Even if a student can
get around the restrictions,
limiting access to pornogra-
phy on the Internet
would bring about questions
as to who should oversee
the network, Musi
said. Universities are the
primary users of Internet,
and they will follow
the administrative lead
of other universities, he
said. '

Following
Mellon’s decision to ban

That is one reason for the
low amount of funds generat-
ed for the school, according to
Lawrence Weber, Pitt vice
chancellor for institutional
advancement.

“We slowed it down our-
selves, due to the new leader-
ship,” Weber said. “We have
been doing some behind-the-
scenes fundraising, but we
have not gone to the public
yet,” he added.

Ed Pa.lascak, the associate
dean of the college of business
administration, said the school
will be useful in expanding the
business major.

“Our students can earn a
business degree with a dual
major in the College of Arts
and Sciences, but we now will
be able to expand the major,”
Palascak said. _

Opinions

  . Block plans inflexible

For every student participating in meal plans on this campus,
the subject of blocks, usually along with some complaints, has
come up at least once this year. Despite the fact that it is still
being billed as an “experimental plan” with “some kinks in it,”
the rising number of complaints should send a signal that
change is in order.

Among the most often heard complaints are the fact that any
blocks which aren’t used are lost, and the rule forcing freshmen
to purchase at least $800 worth of blocks. Yet these just scratch
the surface of the problems that the students have had with the

system.

The rules applied to the block system are restrictive and .

essentially take the students’ self-determination on how they
will spend their money from them. It is up to the students to
decide how they will spend their money.

Instead of “block parties” which outrageously inflate cost,
leftover blocks should be converted to choice_dollars at the end
of the term. Students should not be required to purchase any
number of blocks. If the block system isn’t working out or
seems unfeasible, then perhaps everyone ought to be place on
choice dollars from the beginning. Not only would this allow
more freedom of choice for students in choosing their meals, but
it would also prevent price gouging.

Don't pass costs onto us

The new year has rung in, and with it have come higher
postal rates. This is the first increase in four years. The price
of a first—class letter stamp has gone up from 29 cents to 32
cents, postcards have jumped to 20 cents and air mail rates
will soon follow.

These rates are not likely ‘to remain’ stable. In a report
in The Christian Science Monitor, Brian Hummell, the assis-
tant director of the Alliance of Non-Profit Mailers, said that
the postal service will have to raise rates again in IS months
to keep up with the c.ost of delivering the mail.

The postal service has accrued an $8.3 billion dollar deficit
over the past three years (Christian Science Monitor).
Reclassification efforts may help to contain costs, but more
rate increases are soon to follow. '

The re-organization is not so much a question of person-
nel as of the classification of the types of material it han-
dles. '

As it faces competition from electronic mail, the telephone
and other changes in technology, the United States Postal

\ Service will have to consider the type of service and the cost

of those same services it provides to the people of this coun-
try. ' ’ h

Options such as reorganization and privatization (The
postal service is currently not allowed to make a profit.)
should be considered before the costs of an inefficient sys-
tem are passed on to those who make use of it.

Dickensheers looks at new year

i t h

' ‘ t h e

New

Year just

beginning and

the 104th

C o n g r e s s

Columnist starting its

Ton new session, it

Dic ensheets is an appropri-

ate time to

look ahead to the forces and

events that are likely to shape
1995’s headlines:

104th Congress: With Newt
Gingrich in control of the
House, this may very well be the
most active and entertaining
Congress in over 50 years. On
the agenda will be massive wel-
fare reform, a crackdown on
crime, a line-item veto, a bal-
anced budget amendment and
more. Following some early ses-
sion cooperation, expect to see
nothing but gridlock and conﬂict
as the 1996 presidential cam-
paign will be under way before
summer. Despite Gingrich’s
assertion that he wants to attack
substantial issues and not
“Mickey Mouse” ones like
members of Congress using
their paid-by-the-taxpayers fre-
quent ﬂier mileage, he agrees
with the Democrats that social
security is off the table when it
comes to spending cuts. This is
unfortunate since 3l_ percent of
the federal budget is tied up in
this bureaucratic nightmare. As
much as I hate to say this, I fore-
see a lot of rhetoric but little
action past the six-month mark
of this new Congress. Although
the 104th will be better than
those in the past, special interest
groups will continue to rule
Congress, and the country.

1996 Elections: Yes, it is that
time again, and it is going to be
a wild show. If President Clinton
thought ‘94 was bad, he’ll hate
‘95. If things continue the way
that they have been going,
Clinton will be challenged in the
Democratic party from both the

left and the right. From the left
will be Jesse Jackson, while Sen.
Sam Nunn will mount an assault
from the right. While Jackson is
even more out of touch with
reality than Clinton, Nunn (or
another moderate Democrat)
could severely weaken Clinton
in the primaries. The Republican
field is still wide open, with
many so-called political experts
predicting a nomination victory
by Bob Dole. While he clearly
has the name recognition and the
financial resources, I don’t think
that he’ll end up with the nomi-
nation. Age, his wishy-washy
decision-making process and his
status as chief Washington insid-
er will all work against him. My
darkhorse pick is Lamar
Alexander, who is both a former
governor of Tennessee and
Secretary of Education. As for
the much touted possible run by
Colin Powell, forget it. Gen.
Powell is a man of integrity, and
he doesn’t have the thick skin
needed to roll around in the mud

‘with the pigs of politics.

Although the primaries are still a
year off, ‘95 will shape and fore-
shadow next year’s elections.
O.J. Simpson Trial: Forgive
me for mentioning it, but it will
be a top news story. All of those
who think that Simpson won’t
get a “fair” trial must be dream-
ing. On the one hand this man
has at least $10 million to hire
the best lawyers and scientists in
the country, while on the other
he has the now ever-present race
card to play. How can he lose?
There’ll be two trials, two hung
juries and he’ll walk.

Black Conservatives: Much to
the horror of the Congressional
Black Caucus, Jesse Jackson
and other black leaders who
make their livings by exploiting
their people with the race issue,
black conservatives are rapidly
growing in number. Led by
those such as Armstrong
Williams, Shelby Steele and
Judge Clarence Thomas, the
Democratic means of buying

elections through welfare, affir-
mative action and other Great
Society programs is coming to
an end. And while I’m at it, say
good-bye to the wacko idea of
“political correctness,” because
it, too, is on its way out.

Major League Baseball: Greed
and ignorance combined to
bring what might have been a
great ‘94 season to an early end.
Look for the stupidity to contin-
ue in ‘95 with the start of the
season being played by scrubs.
The question is, how many fans
will be gullible enough to con-
tinue to support. a sport in
decline? My guess is that many
will. Because of the bozos on
the fields and in the manage-
ment offices, baseball is no
longer America’s sport, football
is. And i_t seems to me that
we’ve lost a bit of Americana in
the process.

East Asia: With the political

and economic roles of Europe‘

weakening while those of East
Asia are strengthening,
America’s foreign policy must

continue to shift its focus toward -

East Asia. With the Pacific
Century about to dawn, the
United States must be prepared
to compete in a global market
that will increasingly be cen-
tered in the Pacific region.
Instead of continuing to whine
about “human rights” abuses
and “unfair” trade practices, we
must increase spending in R&D,
increase our individual and
national savings (by ﬁrst getting
the deficit under control), and
continue to decentralize the
management of our major com-
panies. The newfound efficiency
and quality of the American car
industry is a result of fair com-
petition from Japan, not from
some invisible barrier to trade.
Other U.S. companies must
study and learn this lesson if the
United States is to be able to
successfully compete in the next
century.

nist for The Pitt News.

 

long with the countless
other attributes the yup-
pie generation gave us

I was the birth of the “health nut.”

Beware of these people, they
engage in sick rituals of “diet-
ing,” “workouts” and the dread-
ed “aerobic exercises.” But the
most frightening thing about
them is the way they try to con-

vert non-believers. It is truly-

evil, the things they say. “Well,
no, you’re not fat, but if you
keep your diet as is, I can see
you in plus-sizes.” “But don’t
you want to be healthy?” Utterly
dreadful.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m
not condoning acts of gluttony,
but I do have a problem with

January ru, 199:

C0 umnist questions health nuts‘ masochistic motives

999

some of these “health nuts
motivation to become physically
stunning specimens of homo
sapiens. What, exactly, drives
people to inflict pain on them-
selves, in an utterly conscious,
even, dare I say it, happy (for
lack of a better word) way?

Well, it could be a number of
things. People are constantly
motivated toward impressing the
opposite sex by means of their
sexually appealing physique.
(That was a bit awkward, but
you get the idea). People have
this notion that using their
NordicTrack for two hours and
37 minutes per day will add
approximately 8.4 years to their
life. And, I suppose, some peo-

ple do it simply because they
enjoy it.

I am surrounded by health
nuts. My sister, grandfather and
even a few friends (you know
who you are) subject themselves
to pain, worry and the other
wonderful things that go along
with being a member of this not-
so-exclusive club. (My own
mother has her own rowing
machine.) It got to the point that
I thought there was something
wrong with me.

l’ve never been into that
scene. I’m not masochistic. Yet
it fascinates me as to how people
willingly do this. If it is simply
to get a “boyfriend” or a “girl-
friend,” I think it’s time to

rethink your strategy. If you
think it will add 8 and-so-many
years to your life, your presence
at this university should be
called into question. If you are
health nut because you enjoy it,
well, I guess I respect you. I
mean, I certainly couldn’t enjoy
eating bland foods all the time,
engaging in rigorous physical
workouts 5 times a week, etc.,
etc.

But I think the health nut has
really become part of this cul-
ture. You constantly see ads in
newspapers, hear them on the
radio and see them on TV about
how science has developed a
new nutri—grain bar that automat-
ically reduces cholesterol,

"I

decreases sodium, makes you so
physically appealing that beauti-
ful people start banging your
door down just to get a look at
you and on top of that, it adds
12.9 years on to your life. Ah-
hem.

I guess I just want to say that
if you want to diet, exercise, etc.,
then do it. Just make sure you
know why you’re doing it. I
don’t know, it just seems to me
that you might as well enjoy
yourself for a while. Reality is
slowly stepping in. Next thing
you know, you’ve hit mid-life
crisis, and well, you’ve heard
how that story goes.

Suicide prevention a responsibility of community

    

Columms

t the end of
October, Drew
oss, a well-

known and popular stu-
dent at Carnegie Mellon
University, apparently
took his own life. I
‘ attend church with a

number of CMU stu-
Rick dents, so as a tribute to
Nowlin them, the minister con-

ducting a recent service
worked that information into his pastoral
prayer —-— that’s how I found out.

It begs the question, however: Why
would someone that young with that
much going for him even think about
committing suicide? The situation
becomes even more confounding when
you consider that the campus memorial
service for Drew was SRO. Actually,
however, it’s not that hard to understand.
l’ve known about a dozen people who
actually contemplated suicide; half of
those even tried. (Fortunately, none has
yet succeeded.)

While I’m not a psychologist, I theo-
rize that potential suicides feel discon-
nected from society and often believe
that no one would miss them if they died.
Of course, there are several reasons.
Some react to personal trauma, like the
breakup of a signiﬁcant relationship or,

perhaps, a death, others to a lack of acad-
emic or professional success (or the fear
of such). More than a few, mostly
women, experience some sort of sexual
abuse and feel that they’ve lost a part of
themselves that they can’t get back. And
then there’s the feeling of simply not
feeling cared about, that no matter what
they achieve or how many people they
know, the need for intimacy isn’t met.
When you have someone as popular as
Drew was, it can be difficult to relate.
You know the cliche: “It’s lonely at the
top.”

I was befriended by a popular and
well-liked then-CMU sophomore named

e Beth nearly 12 years ago, during proba-

bly the most difficult period in my life.
We wrote regularly during the following
summer break, and one evening during
her junior year after I had received some
devastating information, I visited her in
her dorm room — and she just held me. I

always wondered why someone so popu-—

lar, pretty and talented consistently

I" seemed to have time for me.

I found out later. One night during her
senior year, she invited me over for din-
ner and shared with me some of the
options she was considering upon gradu-
ation — two job offers and graduate
school in either engineering or theology.
But then she looked at me, almost in

tears, and said to me, “I don’t know what
to do!” It took me two days to figure out
that, well, maybe she isn’t as together as I
thought. She described herself as a weak,
unhappy person, and I realized that she
needed me as much as I needed her.

I tell that story to demonstrate that
appearances can be deceiving. The per-
son who may look calm, cool and col-
lected on the outside can actually be at
the end of their rope on the inside. All we
need to do is look at personalities in the
entertainment world — the workaholism,
drugs, drinking, sex, money and parties
only kill the pain temporarily, and when
it returns, it can be worse than before.

And that’s where suicidal thinking
begins.

However, there’s the old saw that
there’s nothing worth committing suicide
over; and I’m living proof of that. Right
after I met Beth, I was reeling from not
one but three personal traumas — in May
of 1983, the university placed me on aca-
demic suspension; in July, I read
the wedding announcement of a girl I
loved but who had completely rejected
me; and in August, my mother walked
out.

What made the difference was the sup-
port and love I received from her and
other new friends in that trying time, and
they let me know I was loved no matter

what. And that’s when I began to grow.
Today, I’m back in school and doing
well, l’ve reconnected with that girl
(she’s still married, though) and have
become fairly close to Mom’s new hus-
band.

I don’t know how you may be feeling
right now, but if you are suicidal, know at
least that ending your life isn’t the
answer. Remember, no one can go
through this life alone, and you cannot be
replaced. Ideas? Try to talk to a friend
whom you can trust, a priest, minister or
counselor. (In fact, in the early ‘80’s, I
was part of a now-defunct peer counsel-
ing service on campus.) Visit Western
Psych —— it’s part of Pitt —-— and don’t feel
ashamed. There’s also Emotions
Anonymous, a 12—Step group based on
AA which meets every Thursday at First
Baptist Church; call the United Way for
information.

In one of my first columns for The Pitt ‘
_News, I talked about the lack of koinonia,

the feeling of community or fellowship,
and as a result, I have come to believe
that suicide prevention should be a com-
munity responsibility. It may be too late
for Drew Ross, but perhaps more lives
can be saved.

Martin '5
stock rises,
will prove
critics wrong

- f you are a
1(\:/Iglgilinnlst Pitt foot-
Gordon ball fan,

you might
have shed

some tears when you heard that
No. 29, running back Curtis
Martin, decided to bypass a
possible medical redshirt and
entered the NFL draft in 1995.

You might have said he
would be better off playing one
more year so he can try and
have an injury-free season to
show the scouts what he can
do.

But the reality of the situa-
tion is that even if Martin
stayed healthy for the full sea-
son, he would be sharing time
with the Big East Offensive
Player of the Year, Billy West.

So off to the NFL draft
Martin goes. Before you bury
Martin in the same coffin as
Curvin Richards, check out his
performance in the annual
Blue—Gray game, a pro-bowl
for the country’s best seniors.

He rushed 13 times for 60
yards with one touchdown, and
he returned three kicks for 102
yards, including a 57-yarder.
That was Martin’s first game
since injuring his ankle against
Ohio University on Sept. 10. It
was also against some of the
better defensive players in the
country. 0

Martin has the talent to play
in the NFL. Anybody who saw
the Pitt-Texas game, l994’s
season opener, knows that. He
cut and slashed his way for 251
yards, which at the time was
the most yards ever rushed
against a Texas squad.

Martin still has the NFL
scouting combine in February
to continue to raise his stock,
and with a good" showing he
will raise his position even
higher.

No matter when Martin gets
picked, it will not be ahead of
another Panther, All-American
offensive lineman Reuben
Brown.

Brown, along with team-
mates Lawson Mollica and
Tom Bardnt, also played in the
Blue—Gray game on Christmas
Day.

Many scouts believe that the
6-foot—3-inch, 295—pound
Brown has all the tools to excel
in the NFL.

Pitt offensive line coach Jack
Henry said earlier in the season
that he talked to more than six
scouts a week about Brown’s
potential.

For the Pitt football team,
what Brown accomplished and
what Martin could have
accomplished is all history.

Versatile

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

You can rattle off the accolades that she
has received seemingly forever — Penn
Hills all—time leading scorer, AAU Junior
Olympics All-American, first-team All-
State, Post-Gazette’s Finest 5, MVP of the
Girls’ Roundball game and, finally, co-
captain of the Pitt women’s basketball
team.

But by talking to Jenine Joyce you
would never know. She would never
admit that she is leading the Panthers in
scoring with over 17 points per game.
Getting her to tell you that she recently
made the UNLV All-Tournament team in
Las Vegas would be like trying to pull
teeth. But ask anyone on the Pitt team
who the leader of the team is, and they
will tell you, “Jenine Joyce.”

“She has come a long way since her
freshman year,” head coach Kirk Bruce

said. “We always knew that she could be

good, she just had to believe in herself.”

Joyce clearly never had a confidence
problem during her scholastic career at
Penn Hills. She was a member of one of
the true dynasties of girl’s basketball, as
the team won four straight WPIAL cham-
pionships from 1986 to 1990.

“We just never lost,” Joyce said. “I
think that we lost maybe six games in the
four years that I was there.”

Throughout the amazing run, Joyce was
one of the better players on the dominat-
ing teams that were loaded with Division I
talent.

But Joyce saved her best for last during
her senior year when she averaged 22
points and six rebounds a game. And after
losing in the state semifinals three years in
row, Penn Hills beat Altoona and
advanced to the state championship game
against Lancaster McKaskey.

Joyce used the state championship game
as a personal showcase. She scored 27
points as Penn Hills rolled to the state title
and finished the season as one of the top
teams in the nation.

But despite her sparkling senior year,

The Panthers (4-7, 0-3), still

UConn power forward Donny
Marshall will have to sit out
against Pitt for getting into a
shoving match in the St. John’s
game. The ﬁght with Red Storm
forward Charles Minlend ensued
with 3:56 remaining in the game.

“Those kinds of things can
have a reverse affect on a team,”
assistant Pitt coach Sean Cleary
said. “We’re happy he’s not

playing, but a lot of times when
this happens the team will rally
around the player.”

Minlend was thrown out of the
game immediately for throwing
an “open hand punch.” After the
officials viewed the ﬁght on the
television replay, they decided to
eject Marshall for antagonizing
Minlend to retaliate.

Forward
Varga due
to miss six
weeks

‘ Pitt forward Chad Varga
underwent successful arthro-
scopic surgery on his right wrist
yesterday, and will return in a
minimum six weeks, according

to Pitt head coach Ralph

Willard.

Varga , who averaged 11.1
points and 6.7 rebounds a game
before his injury, hurt his
wrist in the Dec. 19 Duquesne
game. '

Varga had torn cartilage
removed from his wrist. He also
had torn ligaments, but it
required no corrective surgery.

Also, walk-on forward Mahdi
Spruill will miss three to four
weeks because of a stress frac-
ture in his left foot.

The Panthers have played all
but two games with seven avail-
able scholarship players.

Asst. News Editor

Beginning in 1996, high
school athletes who want
to play sports in college
are going to have to do
better in their academics.

Proposition 16, original-
ly scheduled to go into
effect in August of 1995,
will be delayed one year,
the NCAA announced
yesterday at their annual
convention. Pitt Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes is at
the conference in San
Diego, scheduled to last
until Thursday.

“It sends a loud and
clear message to high
school students. If you
want to compete in col-
lege athletics, you must
concentrate on your acad-
emics,” Jaynes said.

The current rule in the
NCAA for eligibility is
that. an incoming athlete
must have at least a score
of 700 on the SAT and a
2.0 GPA to be eligible.
Under Prop 16, the stan-
dards will be on a “sliding
scale” according to
Jaynes.

“If someone scores a

NCAA passes Prop
76 for next year

2.0, then they will need a
minimum of 900 of the
SATs. If they have a 2.5
GPA, then they need a 700
on their SATs,” Jaynes
said.

The rule change basical-
ly ‘means that the higher
you score on your SAT’s,
the lower your GPA has to
be to meet the NCAA
standards. The lower your
SATs, the higher your

' GPA has to be.

Jaynes said he is unsure
how the rule changes will
effect Pitt’s recruiting,
only that every school will
be affected the same.

“There is no question
that there might be some
students in the grey zone
that may not meet the eli-
gibility requirements,”
Jaynes said.

There was one proposal
that was voted on at the
conference concerning
Proposition 48. Jaynes
said that Prop 48 players
will be allowed to practice
during the year they must
sit out, and they also will
be allowed to receive aid,
only they will still not be
allowed to participate in
competition.

game, with a point differential of
23.6 per game.

UConn is led by 6-6 multi—tal-
ented sophomore slasher Ray
Allen. Allen, who is seventh in
the league in scoring with 18.6
per game, can hit from the out-
side and slice to the hole with
great proficiency. He is among
the conference leaders in three-
point shooting and field goal
percentage.

“We’re not looking to stop an
individual,” Cleary said. “We
just have to beware of his pres-
ence at all time. A player as tal-
ented as Allen, you can’t ﬂat out
shut him down.”

Allen was beaten out for
Freshman of the Year honors last
season by fellow teammate
Doron Sheffer. Sheffer, a 6-5
combo-guard from Ramat Efal,
Israel, is the complete package.
Sheffer averaged 11.9 a game
last season while finishing sec-
ond in assists. He also led the
team in steals and three—pointers.

“He’s a tremendous player,”
Cleary said. “He’s much more
athletic than people give him
credit for. He’s extremely smart
and versatile. Doron is the glue
to the team because he makes
few mental mistakes.

“He’s definitely an NBA play-
er.” .
Sheffer, a natural point guard,
plays mostly shooting guard
because of 6-4 senior Kevin
Ollie’s quickness. Ollie is aver-
aging 12 points and six assists a
game.

In the middle is 7—foot Travis
Knight, who is improving with
each game. Recently against
Hartford, Knight notched a
career best 16 points, 10
rebounds and four blocked
shots. He’s averaging eight
rebounds and over two blocks a
game.

Unlike Pitt’s skimpy bench,
Calhoun has a plethora of com-
binations to deal with.

Shooter Brian Fair is the first
man off the bench. He’s instant
offense whose range starts in the
locker room. As the sixth man,
he’s the third-leading scorer with
a 13.5 average.

Not just explosive on the
offensive end, UConn is also
one of the best defensive teams
in the Big’ East. The Huskies
have held opponents to under 66
points a game.

“Their defense creates
offense,” Cleary said. “They
have so many good players that
any one of them could be stars
on other teams.” -

The Panthers have had their
share of problems on the offen-
sive end. Second-to-last in the
league, Pitt averages 72 points,
while it is dead last in defense
— relinquishing 75.3 a game.

With all the statistics, stand-
ings and odds stacked against
Pitt, it could be a perfect time to
sneak up and to do something
teams like Duke, Illinois and
Villanova haven’t done yet.

“We really have to look at this
33 an 0PP0Ftl1I1itY,” Cleary said.
“Playing one of the best teams in
the country, undefeated, on our
home ﬂoor, it’s a great opportu-
mty.

“We feel we can win the
game; we always do.”

The Pitt News, Tuesday, January 10,_ 1995

she was not high on many col-
lege coaches’ wish lists.

“I wasn’t really heavily
recruited by big schools,” she
said. “I wasn’t a major stand-
out. I didn’t average 30 points
a game because our team was
so solid.”

Kent State, Iowa, LaSalle
and Manhatten came calling,
but Joyce
decided on
S i e n a
College in
New York.
Pitt was
interested,
but not
enough to
keep her from almost signing a
letter of intent.

But a coaching change at
Siena left her situation
unknown as to where she
would end up. The change ulti-
mately led to her becoming a
Panther.

“We signed her late,’’ Bruce
said. “It was a little odd. She
had committed and the coach
had left. We felt that she was
too hard to pass up. I talked to

-both her and her parents, and
- we felt that we could help her

and she could help us.”

But at the beginning of her
college career at Pitt, Joyce
felt that she wasn’t helping
anyone.

“My freshman year, I came
and barely played at all at
first,” she said. “I sat on the
bench forever, but started to
play well later on in the season
and ended up starting 11
games.”

Limited playing time was
bad enough, but nothing could
prepare her for what was to
come her sophomore year. A
severe ankle injury that
required surgery left her med-
ically redshirted and question-
ing herself as a player.

“It was a nagging injury,”
Bruce said. “It just would not
go away. After a while it really
got to her.”

The season after her injury
was mediocre at best as she
appeared in 27 games and
averaged only four points a
contest. But as she began to
log more minutes, her confi-
dence gradually returned.

Last year was her break-
through season. Joyce started
30 games and was the second-
leading scorer on the Lady
Panther squad that finished 21-
10 and advanced to the
Women’s NIT.

Despite being overshadowed
at times by scoring sensation
Jonna Huemerich, Joyce was
clearly an integral part of Pitt’s
run.

“It is a natural thing to hap-
pen that Jonna may have over-
shadowed her a bit,” Bruce
said. “But there were so many
games that if she wouldn’t
have been there for us, there is
no way we would have won.”

This season, Huemerich has
graduated, and Joyce is being
asked to lead the young team.

“She has a quiet confi-
dence,” point guard Carol
Morton said. “She pulls us

together and encourages every-
one, but she doesn’t need to
yell.” .

“This is a new role for me,”
Joyce said. “I don’t like to get
on people. A lot of people
think that they are leaders by
screaming and yelling at peo-
ple. It just doesn’t work effec-
tively. I think that I lead more
by example.”

And she is a good model for

So far, her inside-outside
game has led Pitt to a 9-3
record, despite the fact that the
Panthers are picked to finish
near the bottom of the confer-
ence.

“I really didn’t have any idea
how this team would be,”
Joyce said. “But I think that
we are really going to surprise
some people. I think that a lot
of people underestimate us.”

young players to follow.
Versatility is a key word in
describing Joyce and her style
of play. At 5-foot-9—inches,
she plays at the small forward
position. But with the ability to
score both inside and out, she
can play any position on the
court.

“I can put her anywhere,”
Bruce said. “She can step out-
side and hit a jumper just as
well she can score down
low. She is just a great player.
We have no problems with
her.”.

But regardless of how the
team finishes, Joyce will end
her collegiate career this sea-

. son as one of the of the most

respected players on the team,
both on and off the court.

“She is really very modest
and humble,” Morton said.
“Everyone should be lucky
enough to have someone like
her on their team.”

“Jenine is the same girl that
she was five years ago,” Bruce
said.

“She was always a nice per-
son with a big heart.”
