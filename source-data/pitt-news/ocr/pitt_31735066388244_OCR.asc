Student Government Board presidential
candidates Julie Shepard and Kurt Stark met for a
debate last night -in the William Pitt Union Ballroom
in a ﬁnal struggle to lead the board next year.

The event began with candidates ‘ presenting
opening statements. Current board member Julie
Shepard stressed her experience and
accomplishments on the board.

“Being a board member is just not good enough.
I took the initiative to get to know the allocations
process,” she said. ‘

In his opening statement, Stark immediately shot
down Shepard’s claim. He said that the only waya
person can get a thorough knowledge of the

V allocations process is by serving on the committee.

behind closed doors,” he said.

Stark went on to detail projects that he hopes to
initiate if elected, including a “campus credit card”
that could be used at businesses on- and off-
campus.

Shepard got her chance to strike back later in the
debate, when a member of the audience asked
Stark where the funding for the credit system
would come from.

She pointed out that the Syracuse and Tulane
University cards, which Stark cited as models for
the project,‘ were just “something like Choice
Dollars [meal planl.”

“There's a lot of startup costs involved [with
expanding to a credit system]. I’m not sure college
students have the kind of income to make this a
proﬁtable investment. We’ve got a corporation
here,” she said, referring to the university.

Candidates were also questioned about their '

Comedian connects racism and drug addiction

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

The subjects of sex, disease,
nutrition, racism, crime, drug
addiction and politics brought
the audience in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room to a
standing ovation last night after a
speech given by noted comedian,
human rights activist and author
Dick Gregory.

In this, the second event of
Pitt’s Black Week, Gregory treated
each of his subjects with a mixture
of outrageous, often earthy,
humor and serious insight.

He was introduced by Black
Action Society President Terri
Tinnin, who described him as
difflCl.ll[‘ to label except as’ a man
“for people.”

Gregory’s entrance after his
introduction was delayed, and

 

he apologized that he had to “go
pee.” When the audience
laughed, Gregory said that it was
funny how you can mention

throughout the night, as well as
what happens when one tries to
go against the universal order.

“America [has been] paying an

to Gregory, the oppressors of this
country have hated so much that
they have begun to turn the hate
against themselves.

to take care of their bodies.
Disease, to Gregory, is a warning
of death, not a direct path to
death. He likens the onset of
disease to coming home and
finding that your son's friends
have trashed your house in a
wild party.

“When the doctor says that you
have high blood pressure, sugar
diabetes or cancer, ask who’s
been there and don’t let the
come back,” he said. ‘

Gregory spent the remainder‘

of the program taking questions
from the audience. “He’s an
excellent speaker and very
knowledgeable,” said Tinnin. “I
think the general audience related
[to what he was saying].’’

An impossible choice...  

At least this year there is‘ more than one candidate.

However, this may be the only redeeming quality of
this year’s Student Government presidential election.
While there technically is a choice, nothing said during
the campaign has made either candidate stand out.

Julie Shepard, currently a board member, and Kurt
Stark, a member of the allocations committee, repre-
sent both branches of Student Government. Both claim
to have the experience to govern; however, both have
avoided stating specific accomplishments of their
tenure. Both claim to have new ideas, but neither has
offered detailed plans, only vague promises.

To be fair, it is difficult to predict who will be the
better president. Both may be exceptional leaders, with
ideas that are creative as well as pragmatic. Both may
have their fingers on the pulse of the student body. But
nothing has been said either to prove or disprove this.

Because of the mediocre campaign, we cannot
endorse a candidate‘? "There have been several “meet V
the candidate” opportunities; however, neither candi-
date has done anything to earn our endorsement.

...a relatively easy choice

In contrast to the presidential election, picking five
Student Government Board candidates to endorse has
been relatively easy.

Patrick Abramowich has experience on the SGB
governmental relations committee, and his responses
to questions posed about his plans have been logical
and practical. By accepting that plans for cable in the
dorms are unrealistic, and focusing on improving
future dorms, Abramowich has indicated that he is
down-to-earth.

Though not elected yet, Michael Cohen has already
shown that he can take criticism constructively, turning
a negative into a positive. Instead of becoming angry
about a past editorial cartoon, Cohen showed class by
laughing it off and doing something about it. He will
have to pay for his SGB "calendar, but it looks like he ’
willaccomplish his promise if. elected.

 Our very own Katie Malaspina is also a candidate we
age endorsing. Though she has not worked for us very
long, she has already shown enthusiasm and determi-
nation, and there is little doubt that she will take these
qualities to the board. Those who think we endorse all
of our employees, past or present, should look atthe
editorial on the presidential race. ' 4

After serving on both the SGB judicial committee and
the Student Judicial Board, Theresa Wilson has proven .
that she not only has the necessary experience, but is
comrnittedto improving student life. She has pledged
to provide programs for commuters, often the most
neglected population on campus, and has strong ideas
on how to rate teaching assistants.

.. Lastly, Michael Golden has worked as a mentor and
a teaching assistant for Freshman Studies, and seems to
be assertive enough to accomplish things. His proposal
to rate off-campus housing is long overdue after years
of Oakland slurnlords, and may be the best idea-offered ‘
during the entire campaign. , ,

Of course, we won't know how much these candi-
dates will accomplish unless they are elected. How-
egger, we can say that in terms of experience, ideas and
 these are the candidates who look best.

Americans tongue—tied at Chautauqua

As a_patriotic American, Pitt stu-
dent and modern-day Cold War-
rior, I made the Oct. 29 to Nov. 3
events of the Chautauqua confer-
ence a top priority on my school
schedule for last week.

Basically, there were no major
surprises in U.S.-Soviet relations
here at Pitt —— although in the real
world, Soviet police beat candle-
light protestors with clubs outside
KGB headquarters in Moscow, and
Bush and Gorbachev decided on a

‘summit. What I did notice about .

-last week was that the Oct. 30 event
which featured Soviet journalist
Vladimir Pozner and U.S. journalist

Phil Donahue seemed to set the’

tone for all of the politically ori-
ented events of the week. If you
wanted a summary of the week’s
events in one show, this was it.

The most irritating aspect of the
Pozner/Donahue event (and all of
the events) was the type of ques-
tions asked by the audience, or
more appropriately, ' the lack of
questions.

It seemed impossible for a ques-
tioner to stand up at one of the
podiurns and ask a simple and
frank question. Instead, each one
had to present a long, elaborate
and boring speech with his simple
solution for detente: Let’s just quit

lighting. This brain-draining de-

duction was repeated at least a
dozen times in every event, with
the same thunderous applause in
response that has become synony-
mous with any common-sense
statement made by a member-of a
Donahue audience.

One of the many self-designated
dove-envoys of the week repre-
sented the conscience of America
by reiterating the common theme:

We want peace, too. (And I don’t '
have a question, either.) I found _

myself perplexed as to how she
came to that glorious conclusion,
that momentous, yet perfectly ap-
propriate revelation, that piece of
existential reasoning that was surely
beyond the intellectual grasp of the
“idiots” who run this country and
the “fat cats” at the Pentagon. (Who,

you see, are always trying to start a '

war because they don’t know any
better.) Perhaps she bumped her
head as she was stepping out of her

car.

Most alarming about the events
I attended during the week was
that whoever could spout the
strongest anti-America, imperi-
alist America or egotistical .
America statement —— whether
or not it was true, far-fetched or
ridiculous —— usually received
the most receptive applause.

One person made an “imperi-
alist America” comment that was
so ludicrous and utterly false
that I found myself postulating
aloud: What mad scientist has

 

transplanted the brain of a bron-
tosaurus into this poor» woman?

Of course, at the Pozner/
Donahue show, no one ‘dared to

the last half-century in Uncle
Sam’s name.”, (A real shocker
with, you guessed it, thunder-
ous applause.) Actually, most of -
the wo rld doesn’t want the kind
of foreign policy that the Rus-
sians have had for the past half-
century.

’ One person was intrigued as
to why there has always been
such a strong anti—communist
hysteria in the U.S._ Perhaps a
more interesting question would
be one inquiring why there has

. always been such a strong anti-

, money on defense to counter a -

make a comment that would .

stand up for America or that
could be interpreted as "ﬂag-
waving. ” (We know that's anath-
ema in America today.) But just
about when I had decided to
leave that particular show, after
dozing off for the nth time, I
spotted a man near one of the
podiurns dressed as Uncle Sam.
By this point, I was dying to
hear a question that would put
the Soviet Union on the defen-I

sive, just for -the sake of livening _

the place upa bit — maybe

something like: Why did you -

guys invade Hungary in 1956,
Czechoslovakia ' in 1968 and
Afghanistan in 1978? We
should’ve dropped the bomb
on you damn Reds right after
WWII! .
Here comes the haymaker, I
thought, from the true-blooded
American, the U.S. ﬂag-waving
hardliner -- Uncle Sam himself‘.
But it appeared ittwas too late.
The pervasive “when-it-comes
down-to-it-the-Cold-War-is-
probably-the-U.S.’s-fault" mood
had hit this Uncle Sam even
-harder than the latest Soviet
modernized short-range missile.
This Uncle Sam stated, “Most
Americans don’t want the for-

eign policy that we’ve had for

communist hysteria in the So-
viet Union. ,

One woman couldn’t under-
stand why the U.S. government’
insists upon’ spending so much

Soviet threat when there are so
many homeless in the United
States. She represented the per-
petually tongue-locked and

brain—locked wing of the Left, . ‘

who couldn’t seem to say any-
thing but, “What about the-
homeless? What about

homeless? What about the

homeless?... “ I think I might .

have goneinto shock if Do-
nahue had fired back, “Madam,
has it ever occurred to you that
if our country gets hit by Soviet
missiles that everyone is going
to be homeless?!” ,
Needless to say, that repri-
mand never came. Again, per-
haps a better question v\_gg¥g>uld'
be: Why have we cut bur§§1ili-
taryf spending by 11 
over the past five years, while
the Soviet Union hasvincreased

theirs at a rate of 3 percent » 

annually during the same time? i ’ 
There was also, of course, the . 

mandatory, but old and boring,-

Dan Quayle joke.

And during the week, the‘; ,
“crazy lady” that has been warn- _‘ 
ing everybody about tl1e;;;~,de-  
' _  struction of the earth for tl1é‘pas,t

few years ﬁnally found some
bewildered, but polite, Soviets
totalk to —— momentarily.

Overall, though, it was an
interesting and historic week at
Pitt. Let’s hope we can host it
again, and I hope you didn’t
miss it. ' 5 .

getsfirst Pitt
experience. ..

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

It took Darren Morningstar
nearly two years to play in a Pitt
basketball game. So the six-

— foot—ten Naval Academy transfer
did not mind that he was not ~
tearing ‘down the rims with
thunderous dunks in the .
Panthers’ 100-95 victory over
Athletes In Action at Fitzgerald
Field House last night.

“It’s been so long for me I
kind of forgot what it was like,”
said Morningstar, who
transferred in January 1988,
midway through his freshman
season at Navy. He was
ineligible to play during the
past year and a half since the
NCAA requires that a transfer
sit out one academic year.
Morningstar missed the
enrollment deadline after
transferring and sat out the
entire 1988-89 season.

Morningstar got off to a cold
start offensively", hitting only

"one of» two field goals and
scoringfour points in the first

1 half. He led the team at halftime
with sevenrebounds, and the
Panthers had a 51-39
intermission edge.

But Morningstar came back

‘strong in the second half,,

. Notes. of interest from the weekend:

- The Miami Hurricanes warmed up

for this Saturday's showdown with the
Panthers by shelling East Carolina, 40-10.

' Quarterbacks Craig Erickson, playing his

first game since breaking a knuckle on his

-throwing hand, and Gino Toretta each

directed three touchdown drives. Not
much reason to worry about which one to
preparefor, though. The Miami offense
thrives on pass, pass, pass. Either QB will
provide a stiff challenge for Alonzo
Hampton and the rest of the Pitt secondary.

0 University of Houston quarterback
Andre Ware V continued his remarkable
aerial ,assault.‘Ware completed 42 of 63
passes for 477 yards and — brace yourself
— six more touchdowns in a 55-10
drubbing of TCU. With Heisman Trophy
ballots to be distributed next week, many.
feel that no leading contender_ for the
award has emerged. Bull. No’ player is
having a better season than Ware, who is
averaging 426.6 yards and over four TDs
a game. However, Ware may be bypassed
because Houston is on probation.

‘ 0 Second-ranked Colorado’s 27-21

. victory over No. 3 Nebraska almost assures

them a national championship showdown
against Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl.
Jeff Campbell was the hero of Saturday's

._, ..'y.;;

win, setting up two touchdowns with 47-
and 55-yard punt returns. Darian Hagan,
who became the ‘Buffs’ quarterback when

‘Sal Aunese was stricken with stomach

cancer, has established himself as a future
Heisman hopeful. He rushed for 86 yards
and one touchdown against the
Cornhuskers and has better numbers
(1,609 total yards and 15 touchdowns)
than Notre Dame QB

‘ Athletes In Action is a
Cincinnati-based Christian
organization whose goal is to
use athletics to reach various
areas of the country with its
religious message. The group
contacted. almost every
Division I school in the country
to play exhibition games. The
players, a few of whom played
in the NBA, receive minimal
salaries, according to AIA co-
coach Dave Lower.

The organization will play
21 games in the next 26 days.
Most of their opponents are in
the Top 25 preseason rankings,
and games against LSU,
Indiana, UCLA, Iowa, Illinois,
Oklahoma and Missouri dot
the schedule.

The other AIA coach is

most accurate passers this season,
completed just 11 of 26 passes for 101

Despite Tim Worley’s 75 yards, Steeler
backs gained a paltry 93 yards on the

Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier was the

coming with eight seconds remaining to
send the game into overtime. Minnesota
won the game when former Steeler Mike
Merriweather blocked Dale Hatcher’s punt
and the ball rolled out of the end zone for
a safety. Bakken set his mark Sept. 24,

in Vancouver, losing 5-3. The , Pens‘

managed only 20 shots on goal and gave
up two short-handed goals to boot. The
Pens are now 5-8-2, good for a fourth-
place tie with Philadelphia. If that’s not
bad enough, Mario Lemieux is saying he
hasn’t felt well all season and may undergo
medical testing later this week. Lernieux,
who scored 41 points in his ﬁrst 14 games

points, including 19 second-half
points. Zack Jones led AIA with
22 points, and Gib Hinz had ten

S rebounds.

Matthews connected on only
one of seven three—point attempts.
He shot .482 from three—point
range last season.

But according to Porter, the
Panthers might not rely as much
on their outside shooting as last
season, when Pitt attempted 415
three—point shots.

“Our game plan is to rebound
and run,” he said. The Panthers
grabbed 45 rebounds to AlA’s
31, and Morningstar’s follow—up
shots were a benefit to the

Panther offense.

“IMorningstar] runs the ﬂoor
well for a big man," said Porter.

“I kind of mislead [opponents], "
said Morningstar. “They really
think I won’t be able to get up
and down the court.”

Morningstar said he hopes his
first performance will lead to
extended playing time in the
future. ,

“I think I deserve the time, but
it’s up to me to earn it,” he said.

Two seasons ago, the Panthers
used a front line of Jerome Lane,
Charles Smith and Bobby Martin
to combat bigger teams.
Morningstar thinks a large front

line of Martin (6—foot—9), Shorter
(6—foot-6), and himself may also
be implemented this season when
the Panthers face squads with
considerable height such as
Georgetown and Syracuse.
Morningstar practiced last
season with what he calls a “fused
back.” He frequently treated it
with heating pads and support

‘ braces last year, and he hopes the

Condition will not hinder him in
his first Big Eastseason.

“The doctors said it was
probably wise not to play,”
Morningstar said. “ButI feel real
good right now.”

‘ the way. Either Shorter or Bobby
. Martin was in the game until the

final two minutes, when John
Rasp, Travis Ziegler and Brian
Brush stepped in to mop up.

Gilbert Johnson and Derrick
Layton were the only Panthers
who did not play. When asked
about the condition of the 6-
foot-8Johnson’s knees, Pitt Sports
Information Director Linda
Venzon just shook her head and
said “bad.”

But Evans did not attribute the
lack of Johnson’s playing time to
an injury. When asked if his
knees were the sole reason that
Johnson did not get on the court,
Evans shrugged his shoulders
twice and replied, “He needs to

work harder in practice.”

Evans said that he hopes to
have Sean Miller, his regular point
guard, see limited playing time
against the Soviet Union National
Team on Nov. 24 at the Civic
"Arena. Right now Miller is simply
riding an exercise bike and
swimming to stay in shape and
wait for his stress fracture to
heal.

Matthews led the Panthers with
29 points, but he had an
uncharacteristically bad day from
three—point range, shooting 1-

' for~7 ‘from that area. Evans’

indicated that Matthews still had
a good game. “He had 29 points
and shot like [expletive deletedl,”
Evans said. “What does that tell
you about what kind of a day he

can have if he is on?”

Pat Cavanaugh, Darelle Porter
and Brock Generalovich, a walk-
on freshman» from Hermitage, Pa.,
alternated at point guard in place
of Miller.

Martin showed touch with a
jumper that he said he had been
working on in the off-season.

The 6—foot—9 center even brought ~

the ball up the court a few times,
an occurrence which Evans said
may not be unusual as the season
progresses because of Martin’s
athletic ability.

Because this was an exhibition
game, the Panthers record is still
0-O.

Pitt dominates Big East foes

By Jim Iakely
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s swim team
roared into New York City for a
dual meet with St. John’s and
Syracuse over the past weekend.

Pitt, the defending Big East
chanmpion, drowned the
competition. They beat Syracuse
85-55, and beat St. Johns 88-49.

"These scores weren't even
indicitive of the dominace we
had in the meet," said Pitt coach
David Belowich.

Belowich was surprised that
wasn’t better,
considering they had an
impressive recruiting year, but
Syracuse and St. John’s were the
ones taken by surprise. Two of
the many reasons for the team’s
success are Nicole Bunker and
Trina Thames.

Diver
Sophomore transfer from Lehigh,
put on a great performance;
Belowich is “delighted to have

her on the team.” She won both I

the 1-meter and 3—meter board
events (called the pre-quals),
and is now qualified for the first
step toward competing in the
.NCAA championships held in

A . Texas in March. Her adversary
from Syracuse had visions of,

Nicole Bunker, a’

upsetting the Panther diver,
but Bunker “demonstrated
what kind of competitor she
is, and rose to the occasion,”
said Belowich.

Thames, a freshman, had a
meet that aspiring swimmers
would drown for. She too
helped prove that Pitt had a
pretty impressive recruiting
year by finishing first in four
events. She triumphed in the
100- andW20O-yard backstroke
events, the 100 butterﬂy and
was a member of the winning
200-yard medley relay team.

Over the season and through
her career, Thames will surely
“show just how good she can
be. Without a doubt, she is
going to be a force not only in
the Big East, but in the NCAA
as well,” said Belowich.

Sophomore Laura-Lee
Sullivan “had another day that
the team has become
accustomed to,” said Belowich.
She won the 100- and 200-
yard breaststroke, and was also
part of the winning 200—yard
medley team that set the tone
of dominance and built
momentum. ’ ,

Freshman Claire McShane
won the 200—yard freestyle and
finished second in the 100-

yard freestyle. Belowich said,
“she has tremendous ability
that can only grow with
experience.”

Celeste Makiel finished
second in the 200-yard
freestyle, and senior Sandy
Albright ﬁnished second in the
200—yard backstroke, which,
combined with Thames’ first-
place finish, gives Pitt the
biggest one—two punch in
backstroke in the East.

The team had swimmers
finishing in the top three in
nearly all the events. This kind
of depth gives Belowich a lot
of ﬂexibility, and he can give
his opponents many different
looks. The team has a meet
against Clarion on Nov. 10,
and it “won’t be a good test,”
said Belowich.

But with a big meet against
nationally ranked "Virginia
coming up on Nov. 18,
Belowich is counting on great
leadership from senior captains
Albright and Laure Walczak.
“They have a presence about
them  with the bright outlook
of this -year’s team,” said
Belowich.

Tennis temn learns  

ByAdam Kamras
Staff Writer
The men’s tennis team

compiled a 2-2 season record
and a fifth-place finish at the Big
East Championships after its brief

' fall season.

The two victories were over
Fairmont State College and
Robert Morris College, while the
two losses were against tough
squads from Xavier University
and Ohio University.

Senior Vivek Kumar led the
way with a 4-3 singles record
and a 4-3 record with doubles

' partner Paul Maben. He also

won the consolation singles at
the Big East Championships.

f‘We just wanted to improve
on our Big East ﬁnish, which we
did,” said Kumar.

Kumar said the 6-3 victory
over Fairmont State was a high
point of the season, since they
blew Pitt out 8-1 last year.

Right behind Kumar were
Larry Garrard and John Tegano,
each with 3-3 records in singles
competition. Garrard also
equaled his 3-3 record playing‘
doubles with Jeff Mills.

Perhaps the Panther who
found the fall season most
valuable was Terence Rosenthal.
He played No. 1 singles as a
freshman, compiling a 2-4
record.

He found the competition
tough, but used it as a learning
experience.

- “None of the guys were out of

my range, but their experience

“The My

from short season

played a big factor,” said
Rosenthal. . A

Rosenthal said there is a lot of
pressure and pain involved in
being the No. 1 player, but the
satisfaction of success makes it
all worthwhile.

He said that if he had to choose
between being No. 2 and having
a winning record or being No.1

' and having a losing record, he

would still want to be No. 1
because of the experience he
got from it.

Rosenthal, who was also 2-2
playing doubles with Terry
O'Connor (2-1) and Joel Orth

(0-1) said his fall experience ‘A.

should make him very effective
for the spring season.

The other two Panthers who
played singles were senior Paul
Maben and junior Jeff Mills,
gaining ,2-2 and 1-5 records
respectively. ‘

In addition to his winning
record with Rosenthal, O’Connor
also teamed with Orth to win a
match, making his overall
doubles record 3-1.

Pitt Coach
Dieffenbach was pleased with
his team’s success.

“It was a very good fall season.
Everybody has improved and
done well academically,” he said.

Dieffenbach said he will have
his team take a break until just

then start indoor playing and a
conditioning program that
focuses on lifting, ﬂexibility and
running.
