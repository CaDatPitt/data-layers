 ‘Protest Mars Bio Merger

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Charges of poor communication
and “lack of input” concerning a
new department chairman’s meth-
ods of restructuring his department
have been raised by Teaching
Assistants within the biology
department. '

TAs Barry Applebaum and Bill
Hanratty, who allegedly spokefor
more than 20 other TAs, said Dr.
Maurice Sussman, who will.head
the new life sciences department--a

ﬁg:-agrombination of the biology, bio-

I

chemistry, biophysics and microbi-
oloby departments effective Janu-
ary--has spurned input ﬁ'om his
TAs in building the new unit and
neglected to meet with them as
requested.

“To my knowledge, nobody in
the biology department, not even
professors, has been talked to since
the merger,” Hanratty said.
“We’ve had very poor communica-
tion in the deal.” ‘

Sussman responded to the

charges by saying he hadn't as yet .

faculty members of the four

8"‘:

-10.

“I've only been on campus 11
days,” Sussman said. ‘‘I haven't
had time to do a lot of things I
have to do yet. '

Applebaum and Hanratty main-
tain that Sussman has 'so far
avboided seeing the TAs.

“Every fall the biology depart-
ment has a well-attended orienta-
tion meeting,” Applebaum said,
“but Sussman didn't come to the

one we held this year even though
I'm sure he was invited. We had
many questions on the mechanics
of the merger, but he wasn’t there
to answer them.”

Sussman maintains he‘ wasn’t
invited to the meeting.
- The TAs also are concerned over
Sussman’s appointment of an
assistant chairman of the life
sciences department without the
advice of faculty members or TAs.

“We’ve had absolutely no input

on the choice of the man who ‘will ,
,meetings,” "Hanratty said,

shape our department,” Apple-
baum said." “I can’t imagine one
person alone making that impor-
tant a decision.” ,

appointment on his own, but said it
was his right to do so. '
“I c_h,o_s_e_a man I know and trust

to work with me,” Sussman said, '

“and that’s how it should be. The
decision was mine to make.”

The two ,TAs also said they
feared the loss of signiﬁcant
advances in cooperation and

.communication within the biology

department due to the formation of
the life sciences department.

Union Space Crunch l

Crams Student Groups

BY DAVE KIRSHNER

A room shortage in Schenley
Hall has prevented many new
student groups from getting ofﬁce
space, Student Government Board
(SGB) member Tyrone “Chip”
Hubbard said yesterday.

Hubbard, who has been re-
searching the problem in conjunc-
tion with the Committee on Student
Organizations, said the University

should try to ﬁnd other spaces for ‘

ment, which now occupy the upper

Students: Know YourRights

BY CONNIE GIEL

Financially, Pitt students deﬁ-
nitely have problems. Academi-
cally and socially, they probably
have problems.

Legally, they may have
lems.

During their four or more years
at Pitt, there are some things
students are supposed to know and
other things they’d, like to know.
Here are a few things they’d better
know--legally, that is.

1) Students are entitled to object
to the release of so-called directory

En'gineer Cabinet Calls
 For Football Boycott

BY GARY LAMPENFELD

The Engineering Student Cabin-
et (ESC) gave strong support to a
proposed boycott of Pitt football
games by engineering students at
its Tuesday meeting. _

The move came in protest to the
newly implemented coupon ex-
change system.

ESC President Mary Grace
Lackey said the chief objection to
the new system is that it apparently
is a move toward a student-pay

 system next year.

‘I
4

 “Why root for a team,” Lackey

I said, “that plays for money rather

than school spirit?”

She cited the limited student
seating allotment--approximately
9,500--as an example of adminis-
trative apathy toward school spirit.

“With this coupon system,” she
added, “even if they implemented
paid tickets next year, only the ﬁrst
9,500 get tickets.”

Lackey also said she “hopes the
administrators take into account
some of the objections brought up
at (last Thursday's) Student Affairs
Advisory Committee Meeting.”

Opponents of the new plan have

A complained that limited availability

 

 of tickets will encourage scalping,

that students who normally sit in
pairs or ‘groups at games ‘no longer
will be sure of getting tickets for
the same games, and that

overcrowding at and around the
ticket I exchange center (approxi-
mately 4,000 coupon holders at the
ground floor of the Cathedral) will
create serious -logistic problems.
The ESC discussed the feasibility
of organizing other student groups,
such as Greeks and Black Action
Society, into a large-scale boycott.
Said one ESC member, “With
Greeks and engineers comprising a
large segment of the student
turnout at games, a boycott by
these two groups wouldcut student
attendance enought to upset (Head
Coach) Johnny Majors, who values
school spirit and who also carries
clout with the administration.”
Lackey agreed that participation
in the boycott by other student
groups would strengthen its
effectiveness, but questioned whe-
ther there was ample time to rally
enought support to boycott Pitt’s
Homecoming game.
"‘A boycott by engineering stu-
dents alone," Lackey said, “would
not achieve the same results as one

. with greater backing.”

Lackey criticized the administra-
tion both for citing safety and
equity as reasons for the plan, and
for failing to inform students of the
plan earlier. '

“They knew about this (plan)
last winter term,” she said. “Why
did they wait until now to
students know?’.’

information by the University H to
either outsiders or Pitt ofﬁcials and
faclty. This information, includes

p the student's name, local and home
addresses, telephone listing, dates V

of attendance, major, degrees and
awards, and class rank. A

Those who object must complete
forms prohibiting the release of
such information, according to the
guidelines established under new
federal legislation. The forms, and
an elaboration of the “Privacy
Rights of Students,” are available
in the Student Affairs ofﬁce, 104
SU. Failure. to complete and return
the forms by September 17 is
tantamount to a release authoriza-
tion.

*2) Copies of Pitt’s “Student Code
of Conduct and Judicial Proce-
dures” are available in the Student
Affairs Office. Students’ rights are
explicitly deﬁned. As they used to
say on the Perry Mason show,
ignorance of the law is no excuse.

The Code broadly explains the
University judicial system. The
Campus Judicial Board (CJB), the
body responsible for hearing and
determining sanctions in all nonac_-
-acemic matters arising from the
Code, is supervised by Judicial
System Coordinator Al Bowen.

— Bowen indicated that seven
Board seats are open. CJB
members are appointed for two-
year staggered terms. The

applicant must be a registered
student, must not be on academic

or disciplinary probation, and must. .

be available atleastone evening a
week. Applications and informa-
tiontcan be found in 104 SU. The
deadline is September 19 at 5 pm.

3) Early last year, the Senate . '

Committee on Tenure and Aca-
demic Freedom prepared guide-
lines on academic integrity. In
January of this year, the new policy
became effective and copies of the
code were made ,available for
distribution. Speciﬁc student and
faculty obligations are set forth;
among those that apply to both
groups are:

--The general content of a course
or other academic program should
be described with reasonable
accuracy in catalogues or other
written documents available to
students... ’

--University records, which shall
contain only information reason-
ably related to educational pur-
poses, shall be considered a matter
of privacy not to be released except
with student consent, or as may be
required by law; provided, how-
ever, that any student shall be
permitted to review his or her own
personal record, except for it
confidential contents. -

4) University residents can
participate on the Residence Hall
Judicial Board (RHJB), the judicial
body that presides over matters of
resident concern. The RHJB
operates much like the CJ B, except
that it considers more speciﬁc
areas. ,

The Board has several openings;
the requirements are the same as
those for the CJB except that the
applicant must be a dorm resident.

5) The Education Amendments
of 1972 include a little-known but
important portion--Title IX.
Effective this past July, Title IX
prohibits discrimination on the
basis of sex in federally funded
educational programs and activi-
ties. It applies to admissions,

: ‘ organizations, ﬁnancial aid, physi-

cal education and athletics, hous-
ing and facilities, employment and
classes and curriculum.

tions may ‘lose their federal

Planned Bio Merger

(Continued from Page 1)

the lack of communication between
the new chairman and his
department members has led them
to rely on rumors for information on
the direction life science is to take.

“We heard through a faculty
member that Sussman plans to take
office space away from TAs,”
Applebaum said, “but we haven’t
been able to get a conﬁrmation or
denial on the story. We’re afraid
now we won’t even get adequate
research space with all the
reorganization of departments.”

Sussman said he hadn’t even

_» begun to consider questions on

the life science department organi-
zation and courses should be made

Sussman said he plans to get
much ‘ ‘input from both faculty
members and TAs soon.

“I’m going to ask the TAs a lot
about the life science courses we
will offer, the quality of education
they’ll be recieving and testing,”
he said. They’ll have a lot to say
about their training and the
training of undergraduate students

Applebaum said the TAs are
trying to make suggestions im-
mediately, but not at the expense
of the merger.

“We don't want to disruptthe
merger,” he said, “but we think
our TAs cooperation is necessary
for a smooth merger and effective

The new systemwill require both the resident and the guest_to show
identiﬁcation before signing in. The guest then must be accompanied
by the resident throughout his visit. Though some students see this as
unnecessary and even a little juvenile, the request is nothing new.

' - since Residence Life has called for it in years past without really
a making it a rule. ' .

The change involving the locking of the security doors between

 Towers B and C from 8 pm to 7 am 1S no more than the correction of a

policy that was bound for failure from the start. In the main Towers
lobby, one desk originally was placed at the entrance to Tower A,
another at the entrance to Tower B. Why two desks were not also
placed in the lobby between Tower B and C is not clear. Naturally, the
one desk became overworked, not being able to handle the students
who wanted to enter both Towers, and consequently many entered the
dorms who should not have. _
As an added safeguard, student keys no longer open the security
doors in the lobby. Only the desk attendant can open the door by way

- A of the electric strike system, and he will have made sure that the

student is properly identiﬁed.

the Ofﬁce of Residence Life and a group of responsible students.

A New Student Seat

Monday’s vote by the University Senate Council to include a student

‘on the special committee to compile information on faculty unionization

comes as a relief to those who would not have students because mere
spectators in the union issue. _

Consisting of three pro-union faculty, three anti-union faculty and
onestudent,thecoimnitteewillbechargedwithﬁ]ingareport onthe
prospects _of faculty unionization before a vote on the issue is taken.

To have expected a fully comprehensive statement on unionization to
be issued without the student view would have been to receive a
far-from-complete study. Although unionization affects teachers most
directly, the effect on the student body can in no way be termed
secondary.

The necessity for a student report on the possible ramiﬁcations of a
Pitt faculty union is as basic as the reason for which this University
exists. That makes it all the more important to select a student who
realizes the gravity of the situation and the signiﬁcance of his ﬁnal
report. ,

ThatthevotewaspassedbytheSenateCo1mcilinfavorofthe
special committee is particularly encouraging since it reﬂects much
more than just a token interest in the position of students in the nutter.

VV1th students at the center of the University’s mission, and major
policy ﬁrst must be studied fromthe standpoint of the mission: will the
new plan somehow alter it or will it interfere with it? And if so, what is
to be sacriﬁced, the mission or the new proposal? -

V In the case of the University, the mission is a “given,” not a variable
that can be adjusted to meet new circumstances.

The Senate Council apparently realizes the seriousness of the
student factor in the unionization dispute, or else there would not have
been such a favorable vote.

f We can only hope that the general faculty realizes the centrality of .

the student to the University and will take this into consideration when
the time comes for a vote on unionization.

 Letters to the Ed iio r

A Misconception

About Dramoiics

The author of the recent article
about the rehearsal of Mooney and
His Caravans clearly intended to
present an impression of what
theatre is like backstage.
Unfortunately she communicated
her preconceptions and not the
reality. The rehearsal she attended
was not an intense, anxiety-ﬁlled
occasion, but was, like most we
hold-, a calm, on time run through
involving people doing work that
they are familiar with and
competent at.

The author of the article
misrepresented the evening by her
inflammatory choice of words, her
manipulation of statements out of
context and her actual misquoting.
She claimed for instance that a
crew member grieved when she

_actually laughed, having made a

joke. She characterized individuals’
movements as strutting, jaunting,
scampering ‘and swinging like
Tarzan, thus reinforcing the old
and, in this case, untrue cliches of a
commanding dictatorial director, a
prima-donna actor and irrespon-
sible, somewhat subservient stage
crew. In fact, in each case the
people were, like anyone else,
walking from one place to the next.

0 It is important to demystify the
theatrical. process and not to
obscure it. - The play is about two
people living in an unstated but

segregated class/society and deal-
ing with their relationship to it and
to each other. They live in a

country in which feudalism leaves
contemporary traces of oppression
under a landscape of both the
tranquility of the English country-
side and the plastic obsolescence of
modern technology.

Disputes Editorial

The Pitt News editorial of
September 10 contains many
misrepresentations and much mis-
information regarding unionization
of graduate employees at Pitt. In
behalf of the Graduate Employee
Caucus of the’ Pitt Professional
Union (PPU) it is my intention to
set the record straight.’ ~

The Pitt News states that
graduate employee salaries “were
never intended to function as
subsistance income.” This is
simply not true. In fact, most TAs

Therefore, we must live only on our
salaries of $3,000. This salary has
been increased over the last 3 years
by about 15% while the Consumer
Price Index has risen 29% during
the same time period. Graduate
employees, as members of this
low-income group, are hurt the
most by this inequity.

Furthermore, the Pitt News
implies that we are somehow
getting a good deal. In fact,
graduate employees carry out
much of “the teaching and research
on which the University depends.

The Pitt News" implies that ,PPU’§'-S

cynically initiated the $1,000, salary
increase-demand to win votes in
_the upcoming collective bargaining
election, The fact. is that this
demand’ was formulated by the
Graduate Employee Caucus of the
PPU, which consists wholly of-
graduate employees covering a
wide-range of disciplines of the
University. The demand originated
organically out of the needs of the
graduate employees at Pitt. "We do
not make this demand out of
cynicism but out of need.

Lastly, the /Pitt News states that
the PPU is “reportedly not one of

the favorite bargaining unions of  p

the Pitt faculty.” We belive that ,
this is untrue and that the truth will
only be known when a collective

bargaining election is held. The

PPU has been demanding that
election for over a year. The
University has opposed it. It is the

The Dick and David Show

BY TOM WASELESKI

In amove that makes a mockery of
the forgiveness generously be-
stowed on Richard Nixon by the
American people, the former
President has decided to sell the
answers to questions he previously
refused to answer before" the
public. His agreement to be
interviewed by television host
David Frost has set off quite a
controversy, and for good reason.

Here is a man who not only has
yet to repent for throwing a monkey «
wrench into the government works,

' but also is trying to reap a profit at

the expense of the court system.
Who else but Richard Nixon,
already famous for several prece-
dents. would be able to set one
regardingithe purchase of histori
fact? '
Though much of the argument, as
seen by the media, centers around
“checkbook journalism,",the issue
is much more crucial than -the
writing profession's code ofet-hics. _
To pay for news is one thing, but
to pay for history--for truth with a
capital T--is to sell civilization into -

't- _~\.«_: j. »‘ ._:~,} .21 , .
-~.-ﬂu-.'.'-..v-'..

slavery. Not only would we have
conspirators paying for assina-
tions, then paying to keep the truth
concealed, but we also would have

‘those involved flaunting the fact

they know all and are ready to
reveal it to the highest bidder.

Sitting through it all is probably a
man in a dark room smoking a big
cigar and wondering how much he
could get for revealing on a
90-minute TV ‘special why he had
Jack Kennedy murdered. The
possibilities are as endless as the
history they shape.

'- What Nixon will be doing, if he is
successfully evasive. (and he
usually is), is not merely saving his
own skin, but saving it to the
detriment of the proper pursuit of
justice. It will be the start of a wave
of public acceptance of a rich man’s
crimes and his privilege to get paid
for defending them.

Nixon is also in a strategic
position by setting the date for the
release of his interview, thereby‘
havinga definite influence ‘on the
1976, elections. -His intention to
telcvise it after the electionshave

Ii" ,=":r;-1'  .-;i-  .

taken place is yet another cover-up
in the long list of Nixon
debaucheries.

What, then, happens if David
Frost should cleverly corner the
ex-President on his pardon by
Gerald Ford, and some new and
damaging liglit is cast on the
event? By that time Ford may have
been elected President and the
American people would be forced
to swallow it like they were forced
to swallow the “secret plan” to end
the Vietnamese War, economic
“phases” I-IV. “the President is
not a crook," and other Nixomania.

The impact of the Nixon interview
will be felt in more signiﬁcant
places than the Nielsen ratings and
in more lasting places than the
evening news and comment. It will
set a standard, or more appropri-
ately. apdoublc standard of justice
for those in high offices who can

wiggle their wa_v"out of prosccutionsxcff

by quoting such empty catch’
phrases as executive privilege and
personal privacy. and be rewarded

Where will it end?

' First Boston, Now Louisville

fa‘

. BY CAL RITCHEY

During the first week of Septem-

' ber, at least two of the nation's
larger cities were sundered by
violence: “The ugliest violence of
the week came in Louisville...after

a night of rioting, police charges,
tear-gas attacks, scores of injuries
and 300 arrests, National Guard
units were ﬁnally called out to
prevent the major disaster that

some saw threatening the city...
(Newsweek, September 15).

In Boston, earlier this week, five
hundred women and children
marched on police lines around

.2"

. 5*-rtarlestown High School to protest
busing of students to implement
desegregation. There were two

arrests for the first two days of the
school year.

Louisville is a newcomer to busing
problems, but this is Boston’s
second year. Last year, Boston -
schools were in the headlines for
weeks, even months, as day after
day of racial tension and sporadic
riots claimed the nation's attention.

We all thought it couldn’t happen
again the next year. We all
assumed that, bad though the
situation might be in 1974,
somehow 1975 would be better.
Once people grew accustomed to
the idea of integration, things
would go more smoothly.

Obviously, and unfortunately,
such is not the case. Louisville has
experienced only a few days of riots

complacent citizens, but there is
nothing in the Louisville news to’
suggest that next year somehow
will be different.

Sadly, the potential for trouble is
spreading. This week, Pittsburgh
Schools Superintendent Jerry C.
Olson revealed a $45 million
desegregation planz.---but that plan
will leave at least Baxter and
Herron Hill Middle Schools nearly
all-black, and proposed school in
Brookline would have a 21% black
student body. None of these-
schools would meet the State
Human Relations Commission’s
desegregation guidelines, accord-
ing to Olson. In addition, Westing-
house and Schenley High Schools
would not meet HRC regulations.

 t '9.‘ ,.{;}.‘

has been quoted as saying, “If
busing is required, then the board
will have to_ make that decision."
The question, in light- of the
Boston and Louisville experiences,
is whether busing is reasonable
and proper. It may be that busing is
damaging race relations to a
greater degree than can ever be
healed by the integration that
busing is intended to provide.
Perhaps it can't happen here.
.Pittsburgh has many things in its
favor, as a city and as a place to
live. Perhaps the over-all racial
tension is less here than it is
elsewhere. It’s possible that
Pittsburghers are more sensible
than folks in Boston and Louisville.
My experience has been, how-
ever, that people are much the
same regardless of their home
town. I see no reason why
Pittsburgh can expect less trouble,
if busing is needed, than other
cities have already seen.

Against Student Conformity

Vince Gagetta's article in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about the
freshmen picnic at Pitt, ’‘’‘Pass the
Mustard, itt Life Might Just Turn
into Picnic,” (September 3),
confirmed what I have always
believed,--that even such a distin-

In Rochester, NewYork, it's been happening foryears.

The youth is a member of TOPs. Teens on Patrol.
A group of boys and girlstrom the inner city who.
work with police each summer to help keep city rec-
reation areas safe and orderly.

TOPS was conceived by Eastman Kodak Com-
pany and RochesterJobs, Inc. in 1967.*lt has brought
about a greater understanding and mutual respect
between police and young people from the surround-
ing community. _

TOPs don’t have the power to make arrests, but
they learn about police by working with them. Wear-
ing special jackets and T-shirts, they ride in squad
cars. Walk the beat. Monitor calls at the station. Su-
pervise kids at pools and playgrounds. For which
they're paid a salary. ,

people they're sworn to protect, they learn how their

Why does Kodak provide financial support to
TOPS? Because helping the people of Rochester
communicate with one another helps build a better
community in which the company can operate and
grow. In short, it's good business. And we're in busi-
ness to make a profit. But it's also good for society.
The same society our business depends on.

one or two kooks [among the
students] but only one or two,
nothing at all like some years
recently when the places was
overrun with weirdos,” he said,
according to Gagetta. They sound
like a bunch of "dull, docile,
---3--oninative conformists, but
g§f__§g§ this only means that the
brighter, livelier students .didn’t go
the picnic. As for “kooks” and
“weirdos,” those are just nasty
names which Spiro Agnew and
other rednecks gave to a generation
of students who had the intellectual
initiative and the moral courage to
question society’s conventional
values and to protest such abuses
as‘ racism, militarism [the Vietnam
war], economic exploitation, etc.
The replacement_ of this genera-
tion of students by a generation of
docile, unimaginative conformists
(if that is indeed what is
happening) is not good, either for
Pitt or for the country. The
questioning of society’s conven-
tional values and beliefs, in every
area of human activity, is precisely
what universities primarily‘ exist
for, and have always existed for.
That is why they have been the
source of so much scientiﬁc,
technological, and social progress.
Anybody who does not understand
that has no business working as a
University administrator.
Anonymous Jerk No. 1 insults
Pitt's students. Anonymous Jerk
No. 2 insults the faculty, saying,
according to Gagetta, “I don’t
think we’ll have much trouble
telling the faculty from the
students this year. The students
will be better dressed and probably
better behaved." This official, says
Gagetta, was one of many who
were impressed with the students’
-“normal appearance." Again, the
preference is for conformity, the
average, the norm, and the
insulting implication is that Pitt’s.

"faculty consists of irresponsible,

immature slobs.

' By the time this letter appears in

print, Ihope Chancellor Posvar will
have issued a public statement
disassociating himself from these
views, apologizing to the faculty
and the “kooks" and “weirdos”
among the students, and making it
clear that the two ofﬁcialsquoted
by Gagetta do not speak for Pitt.

“You’re the Best! You’re the Greatest!”  

 

5°.->.~._

U nclercover Reporier

BY KEN GORMLEY

There seems to be a natural
desire in all human beings to be the
best at something...anything.
“You’re the best, you’re the
greatest. ” Everybody loves to hear
those words, myself" being no
exception. That’s one of the
reasons I ﬁrst decided to try to
break a world’s record...any
world’s record.

The inspiration, divine or other-
wise, to shoot for the record for
carrying a brick came on a typically
boring Friday night during the
school year. As I and equally
listless friends sat around putting
away a few of Dirty O’s specials

‘:5  and cracking our knuckles, I leafed

through the dog-eared copy of the
“Guiness Book of World’s Re-
cords.”

Then it caught my eye. The
world’s record for carrying a
brick--a mere 40 miles-with an
8-pound, 12-ounce brick. At least it
seemed humanly possible, unlike a
lot of other records. After all, I was
not_about to try to stay awake for
sixty years or consume several
thousand baked beans one by one
with a toothpick.

The idea got kicked around a
little that night, and I got kicked

' , around for thinking of it. We went
 aback to drinking our cans of

Schmidts.

Several months passed, with all
visions of world’s records being"
replaced by a desperate attempt to
salvage the school year and survive
ﬁnals. That is, until the first night
of summer vacation, when a sense
of impending boredom again made
itself felt. Summers in Pittsburgh
can be extremely uneventful.

“Why don’t we try to break the
record for brick-carrying?” My
good buddy Jerry always came up
with great ideas. His idea of a good
time is going to the Greyhound
station at midnight to stare at

ﬁderelicts. ,
.,_,'- . . Anyway, that was all it took. We

each picked up a red building brick,
and as darkness hid the streets of
Swissvale, which are barely worth
seeing, we put on the first of

hundreds of miles with bricks in

hand, and ignored the first of
hundreds of shocked, inquisitive
and murderous stares from on-
lookers. '

My “bricking” partners changed
several times during the first
couple of weeks, as J erry’s love for
Malboros got the better _of his
lungs. The summer was slipping
away, and I was still only able to
_walk about five miles with my
pitifully underweight brick [build-
ing bricks, we soon discovered,
only weigh about four pounds].

My friend Paul Schwekbinz,
better known as Mac, was as
enthused as myself about breaking
the.record, and once he entered the
brick-carrying scene our practices
became much more regular, and
our plans much more concrete, if
you’ll pardon the expression.

It was fun, I have to admit. I
never saw people step out of my
way so quickly, or cars stop so
suddenly to allow me to cross the
street, as when I had that brick in
my hand. If you ever want to
command an instant feeling of
respect, just grab a brick.

It was fun, but now a word about
the pain. There was a lot of it. In
fact, it was excrutiating.

The typical human hand just
isn’t used to holding a heavypbject
for hours at a time. Human legs
aren’t expecially interested in
walking ﬁfty or so miles a week,
unless there’s another beautiful set
of legs waiting at the end of the
path. And the human ‘mind,
especially a student’s mind, likes to
be able to say “screw this” when
something gets extremely painful
or tedious. ' _

‘But if a record is to be broken,
the hand must hold, the feet must
keep hooﬁng, and the mind can
never allow the body to give up. If
you give up even once during a
practice, you’ll give up just as
easily when it really counts.

HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR
PRACTICES

You may or may not‘ be

‘ wondering what reactions people

had when they‘ witnessed us

carrying around our blocks of clay .
Sit back and relax,

every day.
smoke a cigarette if you like. I’ll tell
you about it.

Mothers, proudly wheeling
around their newborn children on
pleasant afternoons, would des-
perately turn into driveways and
say a few silent prayers when they
caught a glimpse of us.-

Pedestrians walking toward us
would veer quickly into the street,
risking death by garbage truck or
street cleaner, in order not to
provoke “the crazy people with
bricks.”

And teenage hoodlums would
wildly encourage us to ""go smash

their heads in,” assuming us to be '

hot in pursuit of some foes up
ahead. -

Naturally, we were stopped by
the police on several occasions.
But strangely enough, it was
usually sufficient to say we were
“getting in shape for the team,”
and few people, even police, had
the courage to ask exactly what
team we were training for. As I
mentioned. before, you can com-
mand great respect when you’re
wielding a six- or eight-pound piece
of concrete.

NEAR DISASTER
Don’t let anybody fool you. The

hardest part about breaking a-

world’s record isn’t performing the
actual feat. No, carrying a brick
was twice as easy as going through
the ridiculous formalities necessary
before the people who publish the
Guiness Book of World’s Records
believe you.

If you’re going to break a record,
you have to have witnesses
watching you the entire time. You

That was a big enough problem,
but you really start having doubts
about the whole thing when you
can’t ﬁnd any bricks.

Go ahead and laugh, but it's the
truth. Eight-pound, twelve-ounce
bricks must be a rare molding of
kangaroo dung, because I’m
convinced they J00,‘ exist any‘
wnere other than in Australia,
where the previous record was set

. in 1970. There was no such brick in

the Tri-State area.

Finally, we had no way to
measure the course we would be
following. You see,‘ it was essential
we walk on sidewalks rather than
streets, for fear of getting picked
off by anti-brick carrying factions

I disguised as motorists. And seeing

that forty-mile tape measures
couldn't be purchased, even from_
the Breck’s Catalogue, there was
no way to get- an extremely
accurate measurement for the
Guinness people.

The result of all these problems

were crippled, ornery and ex-

Chas scurried ahead to prepare
our new footwear, since he was not
only our backpack carrier, but also
trainer and physician.

Suddenly, a bearded man wield-
ing a WIIC TV camera and a female
reporter descended upon Chas and
bombarded him with questions
about the brick-carrying event.

Time was valuable, and Chas
was not about to allow the media to
interfere with a speedy change of
shoes and socks. He snarled back
at the reporter’s questions like an
enraged dog, and nearly pushed
the camera over the curb as he
rushed up to greet us with cold
water and towels.

You need some really devoted
people helping you if you're going
to break a world’s record.

As we passed the 27-mile mark,
John Hurley [who immediately
headed to Ryan’s Pub for a few stiff
drinks] was relieved by our other
star witnesses.

Herschel and Tom Flaherty got
off to a strong, enthusiastic start
with us, making comments about
how great it felt to be exercising.

We had a small parade started,
with the four of us taking the lead,
my brother and several friends
close behind collecting money for
the Leukemia Society, and Chas
dragging his weary legs and
now-hunched back faithfully be-
hind us.

But as the sun got hotter and
legs grew wearier, our following
dropped off. Herschel decided
pushing down the accelerator of his
car would be a slightly less
exhausting form of exercise and

carrying entourage was riding
beside us in air-conditioned com-

us. The Cathedral of Learning--the

We were exhausted. Our hands
were beyond‘ experiencing pain.

They were numb. Our legs no

They were racing for an end to the
torture, for a chance_to surrender to

Original Cast

StorTrek: Off to Hollywood

BY KEN MINARIK

When NBC television decided to
cancel Star Trek in April of 1969, its
topnetwork brass had no idea of
the phonemenon that was about to
follow.

Now, six years later, the
television scripts h_ave sold six-and-
a-half million copies in book form;
the cartoon version of Star Trek has
won an Emmy [the television
industry’s highest honor]; the USS
Enterprise hangs in the Smithson-
ian Institution next to Lindberg’s
Spirit of St. Louis; and Paramount
television has received over one
million angry letters.

Gene Roddenberry‘, Star Trek’s

’ creator, knew that his creation was
more than just a television show
the moment that the idea for it
germinated. In an introduction to

3_ Jacqueline Lichtenberg’s Star Trek

’:_.  ‘ Lives (Bantam Y215l-$1.95), Rod-
denberry talked about the public
response.

q “We expected that there was an
intelligent life form on the other
side of the tube,”_ Roddenberry
wrote. “We planned to use our
show to signal some thoughts to
them. Never in our ’wildest
imagination did we expect the

 

volume and intensity of the replies
that we received. Millions of
replies.” .

Whatever Roddenberry’s mes-
sage was, it must now be coming
across loud and clear. His college
lecture tour has been an unbeliev-
able success. In Morgantown,
West Virginia, 1,200 fans were
expected to fill a moderately-sized
lecture hall. When 6,500 people

showed up from three states,‘

Roddenberry’s speech had to be
moved to the basketball coliseum.
At C.W. Post College, there was a
riot when the 700 seat hall was
filled. Twelve hundred people were
turned away from his lecture at the
University of Arkansas.

For the six years since Star Trek

"was canceled, producer Gene

Roddenberry has refused to take on
any long-term projects because of
his belief that one day’, Paramount
would come to him and say, “You
know, there are really a lot of
people who like Star Trek, aren’t
there?” I

Well, Roddenberry’s wait is
over. Work has begun on a
full-length movie for theatrical
release, starring the entire original
cast. Much of the movie’s ﬁlming,
however, must be scheduled

Forsyth’s ‘Dogs of War’

BY CAL RITCHEY

The Dogs -of War
Frederick Forsyth
Bantam Books, paper
436 pages, $1.95

Coming from the man who wrote
Day of the Jackal and The Odessa
File, The Dogs of War doesn’t'
seem to ﬁt the title of “Third
Straight Blockbuster,” which‘ is
plastered on the front cover. I
never had any trouble putting it‘
down, but I always picked it up
again.

Dogs is a fictional account of a
mercenary action in Africa. Like
most mercenary wars, this one is
instigated by money--a lot of
money--a platinum reserve worth
perhaps ten billion dollars. The
catch is, the platinum is in _a county
that has no interest in doing
business with white nationals or
their firms. ’

some black visibility after the
coup is over.

There’s a surprise ending,
however. Neither the mining
company, no Cat Shannon, nor the
new president of the country, rides
into the sunset. It wouldn’t be fair
to Forsyth to give it away.

Technically, this is a well-done
book--if you need to know how to
plan a staff and equip a small
mercenary venture into Africa.‘
Forsyth has a habit of dropping in
and out of his usuall narrative
style: At regular intervals he
becomes dryly explanative and
almost moralistic.

vAt ‘these. points the reader is
pulled from the escapist attitude of
the armchair seeker of adventure,
and becomes merely a ﬁxture in
Forsyth’s lecture hall, listening to
the author. ,

For example, here’s a passage
dealing with the running of arms
across a border: “The drill is, if
either the Belgian or French

is hired by a mining ﬁrm to topple
the existing government and
replace it with a puppet regime, the
president of which already has
signed over the platinum rights on
a ten-year lease to the mining ﬁrm.
The bulk of the book is a
day-to-day, sometimes hour-to-
hour, account of how Cat Shannon

. organizes his men‘ and equipment
and carries out the “coup.” The
mining company and Shannon
agree that the coup must appear to-

barricade, the first vehicle stops
and allows itself to be searched.
Being clean, it then proceeds south
to rejoin the main road, heads into
Givet, turns north, and returns via
the ﬁxed customs post to Dinant. If
either customs post is in operation,
it cannot return back up the road

Roddenberry ﬂatly refused, and
held out for two years.‘..until' he

Holmes in

BY M. C. PILECKI

Well, here goes another lesson in
not believing a movie’s hype.

The ﬁlm in question this week is
an oldie, The Hound of the
Baskervilles, which has been out of
issue for some years. It’s the
original movie version of that
classic Sherlock Holmes story and
it is, in a word, disappointing.

Ah, you’ve seen the ads about
how the ﬂick wasn’t seen legally on
this continent for so many years
and how it was the story of a
different kind of “cop” (that alone
should clue you in to the degree of
credibility of the ads--a dedicated
or even casual Holmesian knows

 

Shakespeare Conipany’s revival of

_ never a cop) who played the violin
and took refuge in a seven per cent
solution. How could a story about
that be disappointing?

Good question. And if we ever
ﬁnd a movie like that, it probably

-won't be disappointing, but,
needless to say, that description

and Hound have little to do with.

each other.

. This 1939 film--the’ first of 16 that
established Basil Rathbone as the
Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce
forever as the bumbling Dr. John
Watson--is a rather slow-paced
whodunnit. Oddly enough, it

follows Arthur Conan Doyle’s’

original story rather closely, with
some expected editing and a slight

- change in the relationship of Sir

Henry Baskerville with his comely
neighbor, Miss Stapleton.
The mood of Victorian England
swarming with criminals, a mood
‘ as thick as the famous London fog,
is well captured in one eerie
sequence after the next, especially
in the dank, dark, moors where the
main body of action occurs.
A Yet the movie misses, being as

‘Hound’ DisaPPointin49 

One thing is the very simple
problem that, although it is a
“Holmes story,” Basil Rathbone is
not the top-billed star and, thus,not
the main character. Instead, the
more handsome Richard Green as
Sir. Henry is top dog and, while it
may have made sense to the old
Hollywood moguls to have a
romantic lead, this is a Sherlock
Holmes story, and he really should
be the main character.

So, the simple fact is that there is
not enough Holmes in The Hound
of the Baskervilles. The movie very
easily could have been helped by

being about 20 or 30 minutes‘

longer, giving this extra, time to
developing the character of Holmes
through his many idiosyncrasies,

Sherlock Holmes.

inclusion of more details would
have given the‘ mystery more
subtlety, and Holmes would have
had more chances to display those
deductive powers that are sup-‘
posed to be the cause of his fame.
As it is, the characters are much
too shallow, even for a detective
movie. There is only the slightest
glimpse of Holmes going into his
famous “bloodhound” routine of
digging for and examining clues.
Watson is perhaps unjustiﬁably
portrayed as a dimwit, and even

duller than the other charactersof .

the story. His one burst of clear
thinking (in the original story and
somewhat necessary to the film)
seems completely out of character:
Actually, of course, Watson isfa
fairly intelligent man (he had to
have some kind of brains to have
become a doctors) who seems dim
at times_ only because of his
friend’s brightness. . I ..
As to that “seven per cent
solution,” there is but the briefest
mention of a needle, so don’t get all
set to see a junkie cop. Hound is"a
pleasant enough period piece, _but '
the Holmes character still has
never been done‘ justice on the‘
screen. . ‘ »

An attempt has been made to
bring Holmes to the stage with the
recent revival of Sherlock Holmes,
making some news on Broadway
because of the resurge of interest
in the Victorian detective. The’-play
is an “original” story, with a plot“
that is actually bits and pieces of
many other Holmes stories: ’
Actually, there is very little that is
new, and what is shouldn't be there
at all. ~ ‘* ”

If anything, Sherlock Holmes is a-
camp play, comically overdone like
the best Victorian melodrama.‘ The
portrayal of Holmes’ archvillain,
Professor Moriarty, is possibly the .
best of the entire production. ' '

Like the movie, there are some
good touches, but mostly for a
comic effect. It seems sad, in a
way, that Sherlock Holmes, the
single most well-known ﬁctional
character, should be considereda A’: A
somewhat comical ﬁgure. The play.},;_ ‘
has its moments, but the more 8‘
ardent Holmes fans would be
better advised to avoid 'it,
especially because of the totally.
disappointing conclusion of the
play. - .

Furniture Made Easy
For Do-It-Yourselfer

BY CAL RITCHEY
How to Make Furniture Without
Tools, by Clement Meadmore,

$4.95, Pantheon Books, New York
[Random House], 58 pages.

If you’re a reasonably handy
artisan, this book shows you how to
make modernistic furniture without
any tools besides sandpaper and a
spatula, and perhaps a paintbrush.

The trick is that all the
furniture--and there are 24 differ-
ent projects--is made in straight
planes. Since there are no curved
pieces, any lumber dealer should
be able to pre-cut the plywood

i ,’9“%1ccording to the specifications in

the book.

Once the plywood is cut, you are
told how to prepare the furniture
for assembly, and how to glue it
together.
according to the author, to make
“handsome, sturdy wooden furni-
ture at a fraction of the cost of
ready-made pieces.” The author
recommends a glue called Tite-
band, available in most hardware
stores, or any other good white
glue. He says that when the glue is
applied properly and allowed to
dry, the joints are both firm and
waterproof. .

The furniture depicted in the

fig‘?-‘book ranges from’ simple arm

 

chairs to a multi-compartmented

bookshelf. There’s even a sofa.
The furniture can be cushioned
with foam rubber.

A word of caution: unless you
are really a craftsman, this
furniture, especially the first
efforts, might be more suitable for
the patio or‘ summer cottage than
for the living room. (I’ve never
tried to make furniture exclusively
with glue--and this stuff doesn't
even have any braces, so that in
most cases the joints are only "/2 or
3%: inches by whateverthe length of
the piece of plywood.. I’d be a little
suspicious about its ability to‘
withstand hard use over a period of
time. The glue itself might last,
but plywood has a tendency to
come apart along the edges.)

There are lots of diagrams, and
in the back of the book, there are
forms that you can show to the
lumber dealer so he’ll know exactly
how to cut the plywood. Since most
lumber dealers in this area charge
50 cents for each cut, some of these
projects could be expensive: at
least one project requires 13 cuts.
This is in addition to the inital cost
of the plywood, which is from about
$15 per 4x8-foot sheet upwards.

Star'Trek'to Hol I ywoodi

_ (Continued from Page 9)  .

So, another chapter is about to 
be written in the history of the
show the network could not kill.
Times have changed since 1966--a
Star Trek episode cost $65,000
then, compared to an estimated
$250,000 now. But, nevertheless,
the show lives on. '

The reasons for Star Trek’s
immortality go on and on. Perhaps
the most important ‘‘life blood” of
the show was the attitude of its
case. In Star Trek Lives, Lichten-
berg describes what it was like on
the very last day of Star Trek
shooting. The cast was tired,

frustrated and run down. William
Shatner was suffering from a virus,
and the impending cancellation
hung over their heads like a dark
cloud.

In the following passage, co-au-
thor Joan Winston describes
William Shatner on the last day of
filming:

“He walked as if every joint
ached, except on camera....And he
went on, too. Even made a few
funnies now and then.

The director was giving some
instructions for the next scene.....
‘he said ‘OK Bill, I want you to pull
out your thing (meaning his

Kipling always has been a
,favorite of mine, and I found this
book in the English literature
section of the Book Center--it’s
being used as text material for
mine English class.

You probably read this, or had it

r and yells emanating from the

student section only to find the

The possibility of something like
that happening looms quite heavily
as Pitt's home opener against
William and Mary draws nearer.
The word boycott is being bandied
about freely as fraternities, engin-
eers and independents alike look
for .a way to effectively voice their

like the students to believe thev are

have to pay for them next year.”
Isn’t that nice.

 

The blatant slap in the face given
the students by the administration,
when no student leaders were
consulted concerning admittance to
football games, is another cause for
alarm. Is the University of
Pittsburgh student body going to
be forced to accept a fait accompli
without putting up a fight?

For many reasons, a boycott is

impractical. First of all, short of D

physical violence, it is virtually
impossible to enforce a boycott,
while there undoubtedly will be a
number of “scabs” who will not
honor one. Also. is it fair to our
fellow :students,, the football
players, to ignore them after the
long grueling hours they have
spent in order to provide the Pitt
students a team to be proud of?

=lllllIIllIllIIllllIlllllIllIlllllllllllllllllllllll
‘IlllIIIlllIIllIIllIllIIllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

_ The biggest change in women’s
tennis at Pitt this year is not that
ﬂuorescent orange balls are being
used during practice sessions. Nor
is it that the scoring system
developed by the Founding Fathers
of World Team Tennis may be
implemented. No, _ the most
signiﬁcant difference is the pres-
ence this year of Maria Paris.

Paris is a freshman, and
first-year players normally don’t
have much of an effect on the
success or failure of a team.
Indications are, however, that she
will have a deﬁnite impact in her
first year at Pitt.

Just about the time most of you
were out scrounging around for a
summer job, Paris’ high school
coach, Janice Morrison, was trying
to find her a college. Morrison
contacted more than 20 schools
around the nation, and when the

dust had ﬁnally cleared, Paris had
been offered five full scholarships
and ten partial ones.

One of the schools that offered

her a full scholarship was Pitt, and I

shortly thereafter she made her
decision to come to the Land of
Steel. She knew Pitt had had a
decent season in 1974 (6-3), but
deciding to attend Pitt to play
tennis, most people believe, is like
taking a two-week summer vaca-
tion in Naperville, Illinois.

“My dad knew a lot of people in
Pittsburgh through  business
connections, and that’s how I
became familiar with Pitt,” she
explains. “I knew very little about
the team, but the school had a good
reputation and the scholarship
offer was a good one.”

Paris spent the first six years of
her childhood in Argentina and
then moved with her family to the
United States when she was six
years old. Later she went to high
school in Largo, Florida.

At the age of 12, she started
playing tennis at the Largo Tennis
Club, where she had watched her
parents and older brother play for a
long time. Six years later she
found herself ranked ninth in the
state of Florida and in the top 20 in
the United States in the 18-and-
under division.

Today, Paris has every tennis
enthusiast in Pittsburgh anxiously

waiting to see her play. She is very
talented. Unlike most women on
the team, Paris drills the ball
consistently hard to her opponent’s
backcourt. Also unusual is the fact
that her backhand is stronger than
her forehand, though that hasn’t
always been the case.

“In high school I was number
one on the team for three years,”
she explains. “Well, my forehand
was considerably stronger than my
backhand, so I decided to concen-
trate on my backhand. Out of every

five shots that I hit, four of them

were with my backhand. Very
shortly, I discovered my backhand
had become the stronger of the
two.” . I

Very few things about her game
or about life in general are enough
to disturb Paris. However, the one
item that causes her to become
slightly uncomfortable is talk. about
developing all phases of her game
equally well.

“Coaches have told me that if I
can get everything working to-
gether, then I’ll be a GOOD tennis
player,” she says. “I know I’ve got
the strokes, but right now I have to
work on my volleys, because if I
win the first set of a match I like to
play a serve-and-volley game.”

Nancy Gordon is Paris’ coach at
Pitt, and she is counting on Paris’
presence to upgrade the ‘women’s
tennis program substantially.

Boaters Kicking Wall

BY JIM LEWIS

The Pitt Soccer Team is
practicing walking through a brick
wall in preparation for Saturday
night.

Walking through a brick wall?
That’s right. The brick wall is

named Bucknell and on Saturday

night Pitt will play the Bisons at

2:45 pm, in the second game of the.

two-day Pitt Soccer Classic. Alder-
son-Broaddus plays Akron in the
first game at 1 pm in the
round-robin tournament Friday and
Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

There’s good reason for the
Panthers’ unearthly practice hab-
its: That’s what the offense will
pretty much have to do against
Bucknell’s solid defense if they
have any thoughts of winning.

Unfortunately, that task isn’l

easy. To show just how tough it’ll

be, here’re some statistics that

border slightly on the unreal:

Bucknell had 11 shutouts in 15
games last year and over the past

two years, or roughly 30 games,

Bucknell has 18 shutouts under
their belt.

And here’s more bad news:
They aren’t getting any worse.

Out of the 11 starters from last
season’s 12-1-2 team, nine are
returning--which has to leave a lot
of college soccer coaches banging
their heads against the wall in
futility.

Pitt Coach Leo Bemis, however,
is keeping. his head during one of
the roughest parts of his schedule.
He has been very pleased with the
attitude of his team and the way
they seem to gel together during
practice. The defense looks like it
will be able to play with Bucknell’s
every step of the way.

There’s no doubt that they’ll
need that attitude, defense and

' teamwork if they hope to beat

Bucknell, a team that _ lost to
Philadelphia Textile by the narrow
margin of 1-0 in the NCAA College
Championships (Philadelphia Tex-
tile went on to lose a close game in

the ﬁnals to the US Champs,’

Howard College).

Bucknell will be eager to prove it
has a good chance of being the best

'. in the US this year, and so will be

coming at Pitt with everything. it
has, that includes outstanding
senior goalie Ted Peterson and
high-scoring fullback Lee Schwartz
--not to mention the rest of a strong
soccer power who scored 36 goals
while giving up only about four
goals last season.

Admission for. both Friday and
Saturday nights’ games is free for
all students who present ID cards
at the gate. Otherwise, adults, one
dollar and children, 50 cents.

In short, beating Bucknell is like
being able to walk through a brick
wall.

But, Pitt plans to mix a ‘little
mortar of its own.

The intermural office has

announced that the deadline for a
signing up for men’s and women’s’,

intermural softball, men’s tennis
singles and women’s tennis dou-
bles is this Friday.

A The intermural office is located
in 125 Trees Hall.

'e“ Weatherington  

T ‘_ E _ "BY YAIER LEHRER

I At 6-0. 198 pounds, Arnie
, eatherington is not exactly what
 call a big linebacker. In fact,

 is relatively small when
1 ~ fieornpared to most players at the
" - ffsame position.

Yet, despite his
size, .Weatherington has managed
to become one of the mainstays of
the Panther defense.

.-.  “-Football‘ is a mental game,”

‘says Weatherington in explaining
his success. “If you’ve got the
confidence and are mentally
prepared, then even if your

 4 opponent is bigger than you, it’s
_going to take a lot for him to beat

-you.”
Weatherington’s confidence and
determination, not to mention his

 talent, earned him a starting berth

in the third game of his freshman
year, and he has not relinquished
that position since, ﬁguring in 129
tackles last season and picking up
six solo tackles and five assists in
this’. season’s opener at Georgia.
“One of the reasons I was able to
break into the lineup so early was
the help I got from KD (Kelcy
Daviston).’,, said the Miami Jack-
son High alumnus. “Even though
he knew I was after his job, he still

I’ took me aside and showed me what

Ishould be doing.”

, Evidently, KD, who has gradu-
ated, did a good job with
Weatherington. The coaches now
have enough confidence in him to
give him the added responsibility
of calling the defensive signals on
the field, which was once Davis-
ton’s job. For that reason,
Weatherington deserves a lot of the
credit for Pitt’s stonewall defense

I ' in the second half of the Georgia

game.

“I told the guys we’ve got to get
the ball over to the offense,”
Weatherington recalled, “and the
only way to do that was to stop
Georgia every time they had the
I can’t remember too many
first downs they had in that half.”

.2 W._l_In fact, Georgia could muster
‘ fofpnly three first downs in the entire

second half against the revitalized

' I Pitt defense.

 vWeatherlngton subscribes to the

' ¥"any given day” philosophy and
plans to implement it when the

‘the Oklahoma game,”

Smallness Doesn’t

Panthers travel to Oklahoma next
week.

‘‘I’m really looking forward to
Weather-
ington went on to say. “Not only is
it the biggest game of my career,
but I’ll have a chance to play
against Elvis Peacock. Peacock
and I played against each other in
high school and I'm looking
forward to seeing him.”

Weatherington doesn’t have to
travel to Oklahoma to see his high
school friends from", Miami, be-
cause a lot of them are hereat Pitt.
Weatherington is one of six Pitt
players--the Walker brothers, Jim
Farley, Cecil Johnson and himself--
who played football at Miami’s

Matter  

Jackson High School. (Offensive
line coach Jim Avezzano was a
coach at that school.

.At Miami, Weatherington was
named All-City, All-Country, All-
Conference, and Miami Jackson
Defensive Player-of-the Year. Not
bad for a little guy who was
recruited by Miami
Kansas State and a number of
other major universities.

There is one area where size
deﬁnitely could be a factor for
Weatherington, and that is his
chance of becoming a pro football
player. Arnie knows this and is
preparing for a career in social
work once he gets out of college.

Receivers Behind
Pitt’s New Offense

BY JAN MATTHEWS

Although the veer offense used
by the Panthers is not geared to the
forward pass, those most hurt by
the change from the I-formation,
the receivers, do not seem to be
forgotten.

Putting down personal glory for
the good of the team is an old
cliche, but it applies. The receiving
corps exhibit a pride in being able
to help the runners. -

Willie Taylor, in his first varsity
season, speaks for the others.

“You want the backs to respect
you,” he said. “It’s a good feeling
to know that your block springs the
runner free for a touchdown.”

The receivers have accepted
their lot without grumbling.

“I feel just as much part of the
team as I did before,”"said Jim
Corbett, the big tight end from
Erie. “You just have to do your
job. If they tell me to block, that’s
what I'll do.”

Blocking has become a major
duty for the receivers, and much
work has gone into developing the
downﬁeld blocking especially.

“I’ve been working’ very hard
polishing my blocking technique,”
explained senior split end Karl

supervision.

Farmer. “I know I can catch the

ball, I just have to prove my worth-

as a blocker.”

Given thejopportunity to start the
season over, neither, Corbett nor
Farmer would abandon the run in
favor of ﬁlling the stadium air with
footballs.

“I would stick with the veer,”
Corbett stated. “It’s worked so

far.” .
Farmer added to his teammate’s
comment: \

“The runners have the ability,
and if we win, what’s the
difference?”

There is, however, hope for
-those who worship the heaved
elipse.

It is generally assumed around
Pitt quarters that, should the
weather improve, so will the
chances of more aerials.

The heavy rains in Georgia
prevented an air attack; only six
passes were thrown.

According to Coach Bob Leahy,

the receivers will be able to ﬂaunt »

their abilities in drier conditions.

Until then, they have only their
pride to live on. .

to Gordon, giving helpful hints to

and the like. _

On the court she’s determined;
her feet constantly move, her arms.

position. When reminded that few
spectators normally are present at

the team’s matches, Paris reveals‘

something additional about the
personality distinctively hers.

she admits. She moves about in
