Donald Denny, head of the organ
procurement program in Pitts-
burgh, said in an interview yesterday
that Ryan Osterbloom’s new liver
was found through the normal
workings of the procurement system
and not because of President Rea-
gan’s recent plea. _

The liver transplantation received
a great deal of attention after Mar-
garet Heckler, secretary of health
and human services, visited Ryan in
a Florida hospital last Tuesday after

being asked by Reagan to publicize
both the infant’s case and the
national need for organ donors.

,Ryan received his new liver in an

operation at Children’s Hospital
here in Pittsburgh last Friday.
Linda Sheaffer, executive director
of the Federal Task Force on Trans-
plantation, criticized the plea, say-
ing it can have bad effects on the
nationwide system that is set up for
matching organs and patients.
Denny said he agrees with
Sheaffer on the effect of such pleas.
“With all due respect to the presi-
dent and Margaret Heckler, in the

long run, it might help expose peo-

ple to the need for organ donors, but
in the short run, many families may

to receive a liver is through some
sort of plea,” said Denny.

He also said that when a single
case such as this one is publicized,
the country may think there is only
this one problem. “Every day kids
just as sick as Ryan Osterbloom are
in need ofa donor," said Denny. He

donor was fed into the computer
network. The computer matched the
compatibility of the donor’s liver
with Ryan’s, and upon ﬁnding that
he was close to death, gave priority
to him.

After the doctors at the donor’s
hospital received the computer read-
out, they contracted the doctors in
Pittsburgh who, in turn, made the
necessary arrangements with Ryan's
family.

Denny said, “At no time were the

Organ donors sought
throughout the nation

WASHINGTON (UPI) ~ Health and Human Services
Secretary Margaret Heckler has launched a campaign to find
donors for thousands of Americans in need of organ

Heckler said she will soon appear in a 30-second television
spot, which will be distributed to more than 1,000 stations
nationwide, to urge “Americans to become organ donors.”

Last Friday, l4—month—old Ryan Osterbloom, of Indiaatlan-
tic, Fla., underwent surgery at Children’s Hospital in Pitts-
burgh to have his diseased liver replaced. The operation began
four days after Heckler made a plea for a donor for him.

“There are thousands of American children, teenagers and
adults still waiting for organ transplants,” Heckler said.

According to Heckler’s department, there are now about 100
people waiting for heart transplants, 7,000 for kidney trans-
plants and about 300 for liver transplants.

(UPI) — Apparently, the cities
of Pittsburgh and Atlanta may
be declaring war on each other.
However, unlike the war in the
1860s, this one is being done with
billboards.

Pittsburgh was recently
named the nation's most liveable
city by “The Places Rated
Almanac," published by R_and
McNally, ousting Atlanta from
the top rating. In fact, Atlanta

Pittsburgh, Atlanta fight
over no. 1 city rating  

slipped to No. 11 in this year’s
rankings.

Two weeks ago, a billboard
went up in Atlanta "bearing the
following message: “Want to live
in America's No. 1 city? Move to
Pittsburgh! Y'all come.”

The billboard is reportedly the
work of James Roddey, chair-
man of the Allegheny County
Port Authority. Roddey moved
to Pittsburgh from Atlanta in

1979.

Now, Atlanta is retaliating.
Radio station WQXI—FM has
announced that a local billboard
company will place a sign near
the pro-Pittssburgh one, but the
message will be less than compli-
mentary about the Steel City.

Station spokesman Randall
iiinton said the message will not
be vicious, but just good, clean

Pitt fraternity urges
an end to drunk driving

By Dirk Kaufman
The Pitt News

While most fraternities might take
pride in their annual alcohol con-
sumption, one fraternity at Pitt has
chosen to make itself and others
more aware of the dangers of drug
and alcohol abuse.

Under the leadership of John Kee-
lan, members of the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity have formed an
organization ‘ called Brothers
Against Drunk Driving (BADD).
The group has been holding alcohol
awareness programs within the fra-
ternity system for the past month
and is presently planning. a high
school visitation program which is
set to begin in September.

Keelan admitted, “Obviously, fra-
te_rnities doh‘t have a good reputa-

tion”, (with regard to alcohol
consumption). He added, however,
that the fraternity programs will
help the people who attend them to
“keep something from happening”
to them.

The motivation for creating the
organization came in part from acci-
dents involving fraternity brothers
and drunk drivers. Two Phi Gamma
Delta members were injured by
other drivers under the inﬂuence,
and a third was injured while driving
under the inﬂuence.

Keelan said that although the
acronym for the group closely

resembles that of the nationally—

known Mothers Against Drunk
Driving (MADD), there is no con-
nection between the two.

BADD is working with another
newly formed group called Don't

Drink and Drive. This organization '

was founded and is headed by JJ.

Doctors question tonsil surgery

By Joelle Latine
The Pitt News

Ear infections and throat infec-
tions are the two most common
illnesses among children. This year,
670,000 tonsillectomies and adenoi-
dectomies were performed, making
them the most common children’s
operations in the U.S.

Tonsils and adenoids are small
structures of lymphatic tissue. The
tonsils are located just behind the
mouth on either side of the throat,
and adenoids are behind the nose
and above the throat. In the past,
when these tissues swell and become
infected with streptococcus bacteria
(which is only one-third ofthe time),
surgeons removed them without any
doubt. The operation is known as a
tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

Today, surgeons are questioning
the operation. “What is it worth to
have an operation? It should do
something major for you,” said Dr.
Jack L. Paradise, tonsil expert at the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine.

Why are throat infections so
prominent in children? How effec-
tive are tonsillectomies and adenoi-
dectomies in relieving recurrent
throat infections as well as recurrent
ear infections?

These questions and many more
are being addressed in a study
directed by Paradise. This project,
which started in l97l, is currently
funded by a $500,000 grant from the
National Institute of Health. The
children being studied are between
the ages of three and I6.

Although there is medication
available, it only works in minor
throat infections. For the children
more severely infected, odds are bet-
ter if they have surgery. Because of
unavoidable human mistakes
involved, however, the risks are
high. This “major surgery,” accord-
ing to Paradise, can cause hemor-
rhaging, and one out of 27,000
patients die.

With those results, Paradise is
taking the project one step further.
Presently, the researchers are trying
to ﬁnd out if children with less
serious throat illnesses will benefit
from a tonsillectomy and
adenoidectomy.

The second study in the project
involves ear infections. Because the
Eustachian tube in the ear is so close
to the tonsils and adenoids in the
throat, authorities believe bacteria
tend to travel into the ear and infect
it, causing some problems in the ear.

Children’s Hospital is searching
for children who may qualify for this
study. For more information, call
647-5474.

helps us rise above it.
~ Anonymous

The audience sat quietly, waiting
for the workshop to begin. A few
people whispered to one another,
but most remained glum. They were
there to learn about laughter.

“There is nobody in this world
who lacks a sense of humor,”
declared University of Pittsburgh
psychologist Dr. Lawrence Glanz,
who conducted the recent work-
shop, “just for laughs.” The work-
shop was held at the Center for
Human Development in Shadyside.

“Everyone comes equipped with
the ability to laugh,” Glanz said.
“However, I think humor is often
overlooked.” He said that if people
just look around, life itself is funny.
“Besides, we need a sense of humor
—- you have to laugh to keep your
sanity.”

Glanz admitted he was no expert
on the subject of humor, but he did
offer a definition of laughter which

he said was appropriate. Laughter,

he said, involves heightened arousal

followed by tension relief.
“Laughing is somewhat related to

cue to relax the mind and body. “It
helps release inhibitions; it helps us
deal with reality," he said.

“Did you hear about the man
who, one day, bragged to a neighbor
about his heroic pig with a wooden
leg?” Glanz asked. “The man said,
‘My pig is special to me because it
recently rescued me from a burning
house. I owe my life to that pig.‘The
neighbor then asked, ‘Well, what
happened to its leg?‘ The man an-
swered, ‘With a pig like that, you
don’t eat him all at once.’ ” The
audience laughed.

“Why did you laugh?” Glanz
asked.

“Because it was funny,” someone
responded. The gloom ﬁnally disap-
peared from the room.

Glanz pointed out that the joke
was funny because it was unique in
some way to each person. One
woman said she laughed because the

“joke was “gross.” Another said she
laughed because the punch line was

unexpected.

Glanz explained that jokes serve
to relieve tension and to make peo-
ple feel good. Humor also helps to

criticize somebody else or want to
change something someone else is
doing, you can’t do it directly by
criticizing, complaining or nagging.
Sometimes you can do it with a smile
and with a sense of humor. Often,
you‘ll get better results,” Glanz said.

Glanz said he uses humor to pull
himself out ofdepression and to help
himself feel better during an illness.
“Sometimes, we must make a delib-
erate attempt to restore humor
within ourselves.”

At WPIC, Glanz said he uses
humor and laughter to help others
with problems such as depression.
However, he added that laughter
should not be forced on someone:
“If laughter arises spontaneously
during a discussion, then you know
they’ve got a better perspective on
things. This is a good sign.

“We must give ourselves permis-
sion to laugh." Glanz concluded.
“That's what makesjlife worthwhile.
For some, humor is one of God’s
finest gifts to man.”

Ugly people are smarter.

That’s the conclusion of a
study by two researchers which
found that high school students
judged physically unattractive
have higher college entrance test
scores and lQs.

For the survey, students
picked the most attractive and

Study shows “ugly” as smarter

least attractive students from the
yearbook ofa large central Okla-
homa high school. Researchers
then compared ACT and IQ
scores.
They found that the less
‘attractive men scored considera-
bly higher on both tests than
their more handsome counter-
parts. Less attractive women also
scored considerably higher on
the tests -—-— although the differ-
ence was not as big.
Dr. John McCullers, a child
psychologist at Oklahoma State

University and a survey organ-
izer, said ugly students may ,
make up for their looks by study-
ing harder to succeed.

McCullers said less attractive
men who have other attributes
have a better chance of being ‘
socially desirable than less
attractive women because uglier
women have fewer options in
American culture  giving more
beautiful women an even greater
chance to succeed.

Said McCullers, “Its not fair,

but that’s the way it is.”

Something Overlooked

The Student Government Board is to be commended
for its letter-writing campaign urging students to write
their congressional representative to protest cuts in fed-
eral aid to students. The cuts will adversely affect Pitt
students, and the letter-writing campaign is a good way to
involve the usually apathetic student body.

But federal cutbacks are just one part of the coming
crisis for students at the University of Pittsburgh. Admin-
istration officials had asked t-he state of Pennsylvania for
a seven-percent increase in its appropriation for next
year. Governor Richard Thornburgh recommended an
increase of only four percent. In plain dollars, the univer-
sity asked the state for $101 million; the state has agreed
to only $84 million. The administration has made it clear
that unless the $17 million difference can be obtained
from the state, the revenue will have to be raised through

a tuition increase.

If that $17 million were evenly distributed among the
35,000 full- and part-time students at the university, it
would amount to a nearly $500 tuition increase for next
year. That is a highly‘unscientific estimate. The increase
in all likelihood will be much higher, for part-time stu-
dents will not share as much ofthe burden as the full-time
students. The tuition increase for a full-time student
could be as high as $700. A tuition increase ofthis magni-
tude, combined with federal cuts in student aid, will have
a tremendously negative impact on students at Pitt.

The Pitt News urges all students to join in the letter-
writing campaign. But let us not stop at writing our
congressman; we must also write our state legislator and
the governor of Pennsylvania. It is notjust federal policy
that affects the cost of education.

We urge a renewal of the letter-writing campaign. All
students who have not written their congressman, and
they — tragically —— are the overwhelming majority,
should do so by all means. All those who have bothered
to write their congressman would do well to take another
15 minutes to sit down and write their state senators.

Letters to the Editor

Absent , -

Dick Gregory spoke on campus
on Tuesday, March 26, and one of
the major points of his speech was
vividly illustrated by your publica-
tion the following day. And because
ofthe huge amount of press cover-
age given to Rev. Farrakhan’s
approaching speech, I feel com-
pelledito mention Mr. Gregory. If
Mr. Gregory had been given even
half of the attention this Farrakhan
issue is raising, it would have been
far more beneficial to the public.-

I’m older than most students at
Pitt. Perhaps this accounts for the
fact that even the sight of Dick Greg-
ory evokes strong emotions within
me ofthe early civil rights movement
in America — the unprovoked vio-
lence against non-violent black pro-
testers by the whites or the murder of
Martin Luther King Jr., a major
voice in American history.

To me, Dick Gregory is one of
America’s most powerful speakers.
And to find merely his picture, with
the caption “Dick Gregory spoke at
Pitt last night on racism and how it
affects students at the university," in
your March 27 issue as your publica-
tion’s only recognition of his pres-
ence on campus, I felt as if you had

, unwittingly exemplified one of Mr.

Gregory’s sad, yet accurate views of
our society. Our press and our media
give us a very simplistic View of our
nation and the world.

It can be a very candied, naive
view. John Burkman Jr.’s recent let-
ter, “Conservative Revolution,"
which cited President Reagan's dra-
matic improvement ofthe U.S., is an
example of how these simplistic
views manifest themselves: ultra-
right, blindly patriotic devotion to a
mystical, magical, unrealistic land of
Oz threatened by a wicked witch of
the East or, to flip a coin, ultra-left,
blindly. anarchistic devotion to a
land of Oz threatened by a wicked
witch of the Pentagon.

As liberal as CBS Nightly News
may seem to certain segments of our
society, it is little more than a bizarre
form of entertainment. As Mr.
Gregory pointed out in his speech,
CBS, NBC and ABC News have yet
to air a Miami Herald article stating
that a court ruling found a connec-
tion between the FBI and CIA in the
assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Mr. Gregory also pointed out the
severe economic problems in the
Soviet Union and suggested the pos-
sibility that the entire arms race may
be nothing more than our society’s
maniacal obsession to gain military
superiority overthe Soviet Union.
America possesses the security of
MAD (Mutual Assured Destruc-
tion). Why build larger defense sys-
tems? We should spend our money
making them safer, not larger.

“Go ahead,” Mr. Gregory said.
“Smoke your little smoke. Drink
your little drink. Party and coke up
as much as you want  but recess is
almost over. Think about it  you
can make a difference,” he repeated
throughout his speech. He chastised
drug abuse and lack of consumer
awareness among the blacks, but his
words speak to all of America. We
can rethink, reshape and mend our
nation’s shortsightedness.

Your paper’s ignorance of these
and many other views expressed in
Mr. Gregory's speech is indicative of
our nation’s lack of common sense
and insensitivity to the crucial prob-
lems facing our society.

Where were The Pitt News report-
ers during Mr. Gregory’s speech?
Why waste so-much time on Farra-
khan, a simple issue of freedom of
speech, when the U.S. government
still wages war on Nicaragua?

Paul R. Critser
Paid pol1t1cal

This letter is in reference to the
April 3, 1985 issue containing a paid
political advertisement placed by the
Pollock brothers extolling the
virtues of theirbrother Mark, who is
running for city council.

Mark Pollock has stated, “No one
should have a cracker on their
shelves that isn’t made by Nabisco."
It is not apparent to me what Mr.
Pollock has done for Nabisco, their
workers or any other Pittsburgh-
based company. He is an attorney
with a full-time practice, which, as
he has stated, he will not give up
should he win a seat on city council.

James Ferlo, currently executive
director for Americans for Demo-
cratic Action, is also running for a
seat on city council. Mr. Ferlo, as a
spokesman for Save Our Neighbor-
hoods Action Coalition, saved 650
jobs for Pittsburgh Nabisco
workers. Without Mr. Ferlo, there
would be no Nabisco crackers on
anyone's shelves. Mr. Ferlo has
stated that he will be a full-time city
council member if he wins. . ’

Mr. Pollock wants the students of

the University of Pittsburgh to regis-
ter to vote while Mr. Ferlo has
actively registered a vast spectrum of
voters for over one year.

To be active in the political scene
is a student’s responsibility. One
should not be swayed by a one-
sided, paid political advertisement.
If you intend to take the advice of
Mr. Pollock, apprise yourself of all
of the candidate's views before vot-
ing. I have given you one, the rest is
up to you. Mr. Pollock and his
brothers give us slogans. Jim Ferlo
has given us results.

available. A further annoyance is
created by the fast meter system that
brings the violation flag up 15-30
minutes ahead ofthe time purchased
and credits only 20 minutes per
quarter instead of the 30 minutes
promised on the rate schedule.

Additional parking spaces are
urgently needed on O’Hara Street
near Hillman Library and on Forbes

‘Aventknear the middle of Oakland.

F arrakhan.

Many Pitt students. concerned as
to my stand on the Farrakhan invi-
tation, have asked for a clarification.
Speaking as the religious leader and
representative of some 4,000 Jewish
students on our campuses, l
unequivocally and catergorically
reject the anti-Semitic and racist
comments attributed to Rev. Louis
Farrakhan. I consider the invitation
extended to him to be a sad event, if
not a tragic event, in the life of our
beloved university.

At the same time, I consider it a
sad and bleak time for my black
friends who extended this invitation
and, in doing so, have torn a fabric
of our community life. I would have

continued on page ﬁve

understatement. .

Letters

continued jrom page four
hoped for greater sensitivity and
understanding. _

It is for that reason that I have at
times tended to soften my words in
order not to be confrontative or to
polarize feelings. Nevertheless, it is
our moral responsibility to condemn
racism out of the depths ofthat uni-
versal faith tradition which all of us
share. I hope that we may, in consid-
ering the profound implications of
this invitation and extreme divisive-
ness that it has caused in the com-
munity at large as well as on the
campus, work together to build a
new bridge of understanding, even
on the shifting ground ofour current
crisis.

I have to say to Jewish students
that, if on occasion I have avoided
language which is confrontative or
which might polarize relations, I
have done so not out of any equivo-
cation on the nature of this invita-
tion, but rather in order to keep
open the doors of dialogue to the
Black Action Society.

I realize that keeping those doors
open after the invitation has been
extended to Rev. Farrakhan will be
problematic, and I will exert my best
efforts to try to resolve that impasse.

To invite to the campus someone
who has been found even by the Uni-
ted States Senate to be an enigma of
human rights is unfortunately to
awaken for us Jews the most tragic
moments of our history.

Proud praise

As a faculty member at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, I want to com-
mend the students who worked at
the Hand—in—Hand Festival on Sat-
urday, March 30. These students
gave totally of themselves to help

- handicapped children have a fun day

at the university. Forbes Quad was
transformed by these same students
into a carnival atmosphere with
games, entertainment, music and
food for these kids. ‘

I had the privilege of working at
the first-aid station with a fine group
of medical and para-medical person-
nel, all associated with the univer-
sity. I also had the opportunity to
work with some of my own nursing
students, and I was very proud ofthe
work that they did.

I have only praise for all those
students who worked so hard at the
festival so that these kids could have
a good time and feel special for one
day. The students were terrific!

From the Foul Line/ Mark A. Sindler

page 5

The admission spilled out,
seemingly convoluted by ordi-
nary, yet interesting, social con-
versation. But I caught it,
filtering out the meandering
words to hone in on what a friend
just disclosed.

This wasn’t a prepared state-
ment he released — only an
admission, defined as wrongdo-
ing, of his social predicament. To
me, it is a wrongdoing - always
has been and forever will be. To
him, though, the quandary is not
of his imagination.

He still feels confined by the
closet.

He is gay.

Surprisingly, the seat support-
ing me did not sink through the
floor when he informed me last
week. I didn’t suddenly wince or
turn my head, either. This was
reassuring, indicating that
maybe I've learned to expect the
unexpected and deal with the
tumultuous as I would the
manageable.

A catastrophe wasn’t dealt me,
only the issuance of a conﬂict

— that I will likely never resolve.
For the friend presented an

ultimatum a short time later.
Would the friendship, about
eight years strong by now, suffer

. any irreparable damage”

The question did not require
contempt. The words themselves
packed enough punch, challeng-
ing me to give the answer he
wanted to hear — as if there was
only one reply.

I told him “no,” offering no
outside clues that I would waver.
Inside, I was troubled, and right-
fully so, for several reasons.

I have always cast unkind eyes
upon homosexual behavior. It is
a cruel, degrading pattern that
repeatedly stabs that which deli-
vered most of us: the unparal-
leled joy of planned procreation.
Unfortunately, there are some
who wish conception passed
them over, and to them go my
sympathies. But by violating that
which is natural, which is being
heterosexual, lesbians and gays
forever disgrace those who are
not.

What‘s more, through no con-
trol of my own, I run the risk of

developing AIDS — at least
more so since its advent in the
mid-70s, before which no such
risk appeared. Silly, you say?
Though they are not the only
transmitters of this often deadly
plague, homosexuals are the
prime breeders.

And anyone is prone. Within
the last decade, those afflicted

"with AIDS have risen from bath-

house patrons to those undergo-
ing blood transfusions and
seemingly safe physical contact.

So now I counter all this
against a close friendship that
maybe doesn’t have any place for
my latent values. Should
extended phone conversations
from Ann Arbor or a restaurant
get-together suddenly cease
because, as he said, he and some-
body else must now pull the
blinds, draw the drapes and close
the lights?

This incongruency takes on
more meaning when empathiz-
ing with fans of Truman Capote.

I

Turmoil from a friend’s revealed secret

The acclaimed author died last
August — alcoholism and poor
living habits fatally confronting
the homosexual. Whether or not
he is alive, do we automatically
shy away from his works because
of his sexual preferences? Or do
we revel in his insight, uncaring
toward or tolerant of his private
life?

For now, I will take the apa-
thetic approach, leaving my
value convictions untouched.
Maybe that is hypocritical.
Maybe it is a sign that I embrace
a double standard.

If so, may this tug-of-war per-
sist. The friend is the first of my
acquaintances (to my limited
knowledge) to admit his social
abnormality. In a way, may he be
the only one. I don't care to make
it a practice of befriending
homosexuals. I’ve already been
pushed far enough to the com-
promising point, that of continu-
ing a friendship with a gay

individual. Honor, namely mine, .
prohibits any further rapproche-

o

Posvar’ presents broad view of university

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

Pitt News: The university became
state-related some 20 years ago.
What have been the advantages and
disadvantages of this?

President Posvar: Being a state-
related university makes us in effect
a state university, in a sense that we
play the same role that Michigan
State plays in Michigan or that
UCLA or Berkley play in California.

The difference is that we have
more independence in terms of our
own governance. We state our own
levels of compensation and fees. We
determine new programs that in
many states a publicly supported
university is under a state board of
regents or a department that decides
these things. I think this makes us
and the other state-related universi-
ties in Pennsylvania -— Temple and
Penn State —— much stronger and
more vigorous. So we have three
(state-relat'ed universities) which
together make up a system of state
research-type universities.

The disadvantages are that we are
more vulnerable to budget cuts, and
we all have to fight our own battles.
Overall, I think the move was well
worth it.

PN: What is Pitt's image?

Posvar: Any complex research
university cannot be characterized
in simple terms. We are notable in 20
or 30 different academic ways.

Pitt has the world's best philo-
sophy of science program, the
world’s greatest surgical transplan-
tation program, the best and most
important state-of-the-art surface
science laboratory in America and
the unique Department of Crystallo-

Correction

, The research on left-handed
breast cancer occurrence men-
tioned in the April 5 issue of The
Pitt Newsstated that Dr. Susan
Albrecht was the project direc-
tor. Dr. Albrecht is the project’s
co-director. The director of the
project is Dr. Ruth Ann Miller.

graphy. We have the best freshman
composition program in the U.S. I
can go on and on.

PN: How do liberal arts and other
arts and sciences ﬁt into Pitt's
future?

Posvar: I think the liberal arts are
the heart of the university. The qual-
ity of our professional schools’ pro-
grams depend on our excellence in
the humanities and social sciences.
That will continue to be the case. I
think people in these studies will rely
more on teaching instruments and
devices such as program instruction
in computers.

PN: How important is athletics to
this university?

Posvar: I think our success in
athletics does achieve some promi-
nence and gives us a lot of publicity.
But that’s equivalent to the other
schools, like Penn State, where they
have outstanding athletic programs
also.

At Pitt, we have a highly commen-
dable athletic program in the sense
that we stress the concept of the
scholar-athlete. I don’t think very
many universities do a good job of
that. By scholar-athlete, I mean we
recruit and support students who are
academically capable of taking pro-
grams successful for graduating and
entering a useful professional career.

Some colleges around the country
enroll students and permit them to
take courses that don't lead to a
degree. They simply maintain their
eligibility. Those students are being
exploited and taken advantage of.

We are very proud here ofthe aca-
demic performance of our athletes,
and we are striving for ways to
increase the percentage of athletes
who actually graduate. I think the
past year,or maybe this year, the
football team seniors are going to
achieve a graduation rate of 75 per-

cent. That is a lot higher than the
average student body.

PN: On another topic, the Univer-
sity Senate recently adopted a reso-
lution which will ask the board of
trustees to consider corporate dives-
titure of South Africa. What do you
foresee happening with regard to
South Africa and Pitt?

Posvar: I don’t want to anticipate
what the board will say, but it's
important to appreciate at the outset

that in this university community,

there is no disagreement on the
objectives. We all have expressed
strong aversion to the South African
government’s policy of racial repres-
sion. We want to see this country do
everything possible to combat that
evil — it is an evil — but there are
honest disagreements about what
means to use.

PN: Another rather recent devel-
opment that has gained much atten-
tion is the Five-year Plan. In the
plan, there is an emphasis on smaller
programs of higher quality. What
about tenured faculty who hold
positions in the departments that
may be condensed?

Posvar: Dr. Benjamin has said
that no tenured faculty person need
be concerned about job security.
That’s absolutely correct, because
we can reduce programs primarily
by attrition. That can take care of
most of the changes that we contem-
plate. Even if a program were elimi-
nated, we are committed to offering
the professor an opportunity for
transfer to a similar program or in a
similar discipline, to re-train in some
other field or to offer some kind of
voluntary separation agreement.
This is only in extreme cases, which
would permit the professor to
change careers.

PN: How much are you willing to
offer to entice that person to leave
voluntarily?

Posvar: That will vary highly. We
really haven't arrived at a formula.
But experience has shown that at
other universities, the faculty — par-
ticularly the younger faculty — want
the opportunity to change if they
realize they are in a field of shrinking
demand for their services.

PN: Will the number offaculty
decrease or increase?
Posvar: We have 25,000 or so

faculty in 16 or 18 different units.

Now 

Two Pregnancy
Testing Locations

lUomen's
Health
Services.

Some will go up, some will go down,
but the overall number of faculty

.will remain roughly the same.

PN: You mentioned Dr. Roger

Benjamin earlier. What does he do '

in relation to the planning process?

Posvar: He is the academic officer
responsible for the main initiatives
in our academic programs and set-
ting and maintaining the standards
of recruitment and performance
throughout the university. I’m
extremely pleased with his record
and achievement.

PN: I understand that prior to Dr.
Benjamin is coming to Pitt, he under-
took a planning process of a smaller
scale in Minnesota. Was he called in
specifically for Pitt's planning
process?

Posvar: No. He was apparently
considered the ablest candidate we
could ﬁnd. He’s a very successful
professor of political science. He is
widely published. He is a highly
respected scholar. He has shown
executive ability. He's been a very
good administrator, and the perfor-
mance he had in setting priorities in
Minnesota was a part of that
experience.

PN: On a personal level, you are
59 years of age. Mandatory retire-
ment for administrators is 65. When
do you expect -to retire from this
university?

Posvar: I really have no plans.
However, I do think that when the
time comes, anyone should make
way for a successor. At the moment,
I am perfectly willing to consider
staying the whole course or adapting
to some other responsibility.

PN: When you leave, what would
you like said about you as Pitt's 15th
president?

Posvar: If 1 had to put it in one
phrase: that I was instrumental in
making this a greater university.

lsraeli boats
stopping ships

BEIRUT (UPI) - A ship pas-
senger who arrived in Beirut yester-
day said that Israeli gunboats are
stopping ships and searching Chris-
tian passengers on their way from
southern Lebanon to East Beirut.
The man said that the Israelis
advised the Christians not to go to
Beirut and treated them rudely. The
sea route is the only way Christians
can get to Beirut from the south
because Moslem militiamen control
the coastal highway.

Polish priest
object of attack

WARSAW, Poland (UPI) -— A
Polish Roman Catholic cardinal
said that a priest was attacked on
Saturday and burned with a caustic.
The chemical burned a V sign onto
his chest. The priest is said to be an
ardent supporter of the banned
Solidarity union movement. The
church in Poland is calling on the
authorities to find the men responsi-
ble for the attack.

Reagan studying
Japan deﬁcit

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Presi-
dent Reagan met with key govern-
ment officials at his California ranch
yesterday to study Japan’s move to
counter the U.S. deficit of $37 bil-
lion from trade with Japan. At first
look, the measures announced in

Tokyo yesterday seemed to fall
short. Treasury Secretary Howard
Baker said on NBC‘s “Today Show”
that he is not certain that the meas-
ures go far enough to head off pro-
tectionist action by Congress. A
U.S. official in Tokyo who asked for
anonymity used the words “big
yawn” to describe the Japanese plan.

In Brief

Imitation causes
ﬁre

LANCASTER (UPI) — A five-
year-old boy trying to imitate Super-
man burned his house down
Monday when he set a couch on fire
and then tried to blow out the ﬂames
as his hero did in the movie “Super-
man II.”

Randy Phillips of Lancaster told
police he watched the movie Sunday
night in which Superman blows out
a fire in a fuel truck. He said that he
set fire to the sofa and'then ran to
open the front and back doors of the
row house when the fire would not
go out.

Firefighters arrived at the scene to
find the house engulfed in ﬂames,
which spread to two adjoining
homes.

Randy’s father was sleeping in a
second-floor bedroom, jumped
from a window after the boy woke
him up.

Two more
Cheyney officials
to resign

HARRISBURG, Pa. (UPI) -
Two more high-ranking Cheyney
University administrators will be
stepping down as the college
attempts to regain its accreditation,
according to documents just
unsealed from the school's appeal.

The continuing shakeup at the
nation’s oldest predominantly black
college was revealed in a letter from
the State System of Higher Educa-
tion Chancellor James McCormick
to the Middle States Association of
Colleges and Schools.

The letter said that “the academic
and finance vice presidencies will be
vacated by April 20.”

The letter accompanied Chey-
ney’s appeal of the Middle States
Association’s decision to revoke the

school’s accreditation. The plan asks
for an 18-month extension of the
accreditation and attempts to out-
line how problems would be
addressed.

The apparently imminent resigna- 0

tions come in the wake of last Fri-
day‘s resignation by Cheyney
President C. T. Enus Wright.

Neither Richard Flamer, vice
president of academic affairs, nor
Mildred Johnson, vice president for
finance and administration,
returned telephone calls to their
offices.

The appeal targeted and attemp-
ted to answer the severe criticisms
leveled against the Delaware County
College.

Arafat calls
UN. for help

(UPI) — PLO chief Yassar Arafat
is calling on the U.N. Security Coun-
cil to do something about continued
shelling of the Lebanese port city of
Sidon. Arafat claimed that the shell-
ing by Israelis and rightist Lebanese
has forced 75,000 Palestinians to flee
the area, which involves Christian
and Moslem faction.

Selection of
Von Bulow
jury continues

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (UPI) —
Jury selection in the retrial of social-
ite Claus Von Bulow continued in
Providence with a compromise in
force. Prospective jurors being
asked about being the victim of a
crime in the past can opt to be ques-
tioned without reporters present.
The selection process could take two
weeks and the retrial possibly two
months. Von Bulow was originally
charged with trying to kill his wife,
who remains in a coma.

Orchestra concert to be held

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

The University/Civic Orchestra
and the University Choral Society
will present a concert tonight at 8:30
at the Jewish Community Center.

At tonight’s concert, the orchestra
will play the overture of Mozart‘s
opera “The Magic Flute," which was
one of his works featured in the
movie “Amadeus."

Guest soloists will be mezzo-so-
prano Anna Maria Silvestri and bar-
itone Kevin Glavin. Silvestri was

recently chosen as a finalist in the

Luciano Pavarotti International
Voice Competition. She will com-
pete in the ﬁnals in Philadelphia
next September.

Tonight’s concert is one in a series
of classical performances sponsored
by the Department of Music.
Tonight's concert is also co-
sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council.

“This gives budding young talent
an opportunity to perform in a pro-
fessional setting,” said concert coor-
dinator Ricardo Schulz.

The civic orchestra, which was
recently reorganized, is composed
mostly of students who are music
majors.

“They would die if they couldn’t

play. For music majors and non-
music majors alike, performing and
playing is their life," Schulz said.

The choral society is comprised of
Pitt faculty, staff, students and oth-
ers from the university community.

“The newly reorganized orchestra
and the choral society are very good.
I want everyone at Pitt to hear
them,” Schulz said.

Tickets are free to students with
Pitt IDS, and a $2 donation is
requested from others. Tickets are
available at the William Pitt Union
Ticket Office and at the door. For
more information, contact the Pitt
Program Council at 624-3344 or the
Pitt music department at 624-4126.

Gymnastic trio set for nationals

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

Some consider it a privilege, oth-
ers a dream come true. No, it’s not
the Olympics, but it's close. For a
lucky trio of gymnasts, this fantasy
becomes reality beginning Friday
when Mark Klafter, Matt Peters and
Jorge Sanchez represent Pitt at the
NCAA championships in Nebraska.
For all three, it is the icing on the
cake as it wraps up the long season,
which ended March 16 at Penn State
for everyone else on the Pitt squad.

in previous years, Pitt has had
numerous gymnasts compete at
nationals, but none has ever
accomplished a strong finish in such
competition. Men’s head coach
Frank D’Amico feels, however, that
this year may be different. Consider-
ing the three quality performers of
this season, he may very well be
right.

MARK KLAFTERV

The pressure of the NCAAs will
be nothing new for this junior All-
East competitor who hails from
Smithtown, N.Y., as he qualified for
nationals with a 9.75 ﬂoor average
last year. Klafter wasted no time in
terms of improvement, easily mak-
ing it in the all-around competition
this season.

Though this year has been an easy
one for Klafter, his leadership
proved invaluable to the generally
young Panther squad. Because of
early-season injuries, Klafter was
forced to sit out the first meet in
January. His absence was indeed
felt, as Pitt suffered a double loss at
the hands of Western Michigan and
Illinois.

Since then, however, Klafter has

not missed a meet, and his perfor-

mance has actually superseded his

efforts of a year ago.
Here are some of Klafter’s season
highlights:

0 at the James Madison Invitational,
Jan. 18-19
—— floor exercise (9.65), first place
—- parallel bars (9.40), first place

0 at Indiana State, Feb. 9
— floor (9.65), first place
— all-around (55.2)

0 at Slippery Rock, Feb. 21
— all-around (56.5)
— floor (9.8), school record

—— ‘parallel bars‘ (9.65), school-

record

— pommel horse (9.2), personal
best

—— high bar (9.6), personal best

0 at Ohio State, March 2
— floor (9.65), first place

'0 at Slippery Rock, March 9
— all-around (56.6), school
record
— floor (9.85), broke own school
record
-— pommel horse (9. l), first place
—— high bar (9.75), first place
— rings (9.2), second place

0 at Penn State, March 16 .

— all-around (55.5), third place

— rings (9.35)

— parallel bars (9.30), tied for
third ‘place *

Although Klafter should perform
well, especially on his “bread-n-
butter” floor routine, he has had two
minor injuries since the mid-March
meet at Penn State. Both were small

muscle pulls, one in a ﬁnger, the
other in his foot. Klafter downplays
both inconveniences, stating that the
only harm done was to hinder a few
of his moves while in training.

“We have‘ really worked hard the
past two weeks — all three of us,” he
commented. “Right now, I’m sore as
heck. It’s tough work, but hopefully
it will pay off." 7

Because of the constant practice,
repetition and precision needed to
perfect moves in a sport such as
gymnastics, Klafter feels most of his
routines will be similar to what he’s
performed all year long, although
there are exceptions. Most notably,
he will‘try different dismounts in his
rings and parallel bars exercises.

One advantage Klafter will make
use of will be the convenience of an
unbiased, impartial gym. He feels

that the nature of thejudging leaves ..

‘ Peters’

the all-around performers at a dis-
tinct advantage.

“The judges usually start with»

lower scores and work their way
up,” he said. “Since the individual
all-arounders follow the individual
team competition, this could be
advantageous, especially in a gym-
nast’s stronger events."

Klafter described his attitude as
one he hopes to keep under control,
at least for now. “I’m trying not to
think about it too much. I’ll just go
in there and do what I can, not be
intimidated and save the real excite-
ment for the competition itself.”

MATT PETERS

Like Klafter, All-East counter-
part Matt Peters (junior, Apollo,
Pa.) is no stranger to NCAA compe-
tition, having performed on high
bars last year to the tune of a 9.78
season average. Peter's presence on
the Pitt squad could be said to com-
plement Klafter, with the latter
being more outspoken and Peters
quiet and reserved. Nevertheless,
performance speaks for
itself, as evidenced by his invitation
to Nebraska this weekend.

Peters has been the most consis-
tent and reliable gymnast for the
Panthers this year, having competed

_ in the all-around in every meet thus

far.
Here‘s a glance at Peters’ season:

Football team holds benefit

On Thursday, April ll at 7:30
p.m.,University of Pittsburgh head
coach Foge Fazio and his l985
squad will play the third annual Pitt
Benefit Football game at Jeannette
High School’s McKee Stadium.

A 60-foot banner across the inter-
section of Route 30 and Lowry
Avenue in Jeannette sta'ting
“Jeannette Welcomes Pitt Panthers”
lets everybody know just that.

Proceeds from this year’s game
will benefit the United Way of West-
moreland County. Last year’s game
at Penn Hills High School aided
Camp Shining Arrow, while the
benefit game two years ago at Ali-
quippa High School helped unem-
ployed steel workers.

“We have had a benefit gamethe
last two years,” said Fazio, “and we
see it as a great opportunity. We get
a chance to take our team out into
the areas surrounding the city where
we have our strongest support, and
at the same time we are able to
benefit a local charity. The people in
Jeannette have really worked hard
on this year’s benefit game. We
wanted it.to be a first-class game,

and the people in Jeannette have
contributed a lotof time to make
sure it is just that. We hope that the
people come out for the game. It will
be a fun time for us, and we’re sure it
will be a fun time for the fans."

Tickets, which are $2 for adults
and Si for students and children, can
be purchased at several locations in
the Jeannette area or by calling the
Pitt ticket office at 624-4601.

The game is being sponsored by
the Greensburg Tribune-Review for
the second consecutive year, Van-
guard Federal Savings Banks and

« the Golden Panthers. The project is

being spearheaded by Larry lwanski
and Tony DeNunzio, president and
vice-president of Vanguard,
respectively.

With the cooperation of Jeannette
High School football coach Joe
Mucci and other school officials,
lwanski and DeNunzio have organ-
ized a committee to promote this
project. Many of the people were
involved -for years in the Steelers’
highly successful annual intra-squad
games.

April ll has been proclaimed

“Foge Fazio Pitt Panther Day” in
Jeannette, and Fazio will be present-
ed with a key to the city by Mayor
Michael Salvatore prior to the
game.

Honorary coaches for the game
will be three former Pitt standouts
—— Emil Boures of the Pittsburgh
Steelers, Tom Flynn of the Green
Bay Packers and Ron Sams of the
Minnesota Vikings.

Former Pitt athletic performers
from the Jeannette area will be
honored at halftime, and WTAE
sports director Bill Hillgrove —— the
“voice of the Panthers” — will han-
dle the public address system. The
game can be heard on WHJ B (620
AM) and WOKU (107 FM), with
Ralph Conde and Bob Van Atta
handling the broadcast. Other high-
lights include the national anthem
sung by KDKA Radio’s Goose Gos-
lin, who will be accompanied by the
Jeannette High School band. A sky-
diver wearing a Pitt uniform will
land at midfield with the game ball,
and the Kiski State Band and Jazz
Rock Singers will perform at
halftime. n

the high bar, an event in which he
hopes to be a finalist. Throughout
the season, Peters‘ high bar routines
have shown signs of brilliance. This
is due in large part to the creative-
ness and originality he employs in
the event, often thrilling the
audience with his one-arm tricks.

Because the best in the nation will
be present this weekend, Peters
knows it may take a little more than
just “average" to pull out a strong
finish in Nebraska. Because of this,
he has been concentrating excep-
tionally hard on the high bar, per-
fecting his one-arm release and triple
back moves.

‘‘I‘d like to stick with the routines
that got me where I am,” Peters
explained. “But working on these
special moves should boost me up in
terms of competing with tougher
gymnasts."

However, Peters is not one to
overdramatize a tough situation,
even one as important as the
NCAAS. “Last year, I was pretty
nervous. The way I look at it,
though, ifl keep my confidence up,l
should probably place somewhere
l’m mainly going to have a good
time.”

As is obvious when looking at
Peters’ season results, his specialty is

Freshman Jorge Sanchez, who
also hails from Smithtown, N.Y.,
proved to be a pleasant surprise for
the Pitt squad this season. He was
highly recruited, following his win-
ning of the New York State Cham-
pionship in high school. His best
events are unquestionably the ﬂoor
exercise, which earned him a spot in
the NCAA nationals this year, and
the vault.

Sanchez is calm but has a positive
attitude, despite the fact that he has
had to endure some minor setbacks.
He overcame a recurring groin pull
at the end of January, and a recently
hyper-extended knee has forced him
into taking his practice sessions a bit
easier.

“It’s still bothering me a little, but
it's getting better and is building up
in strength,” he stated. “I've had it
wrapped for my workouts. Hope-
fully I won’t need the wrapping
when it comes to the competition."

Here’s a brief look at Sanchez's
season: ‘

Because of his freshman status,
Sanchez knows his limitations in
such a pressurized situation. ‘‘I’m
very optimistic right now," he main-
tained. “I really can’t expect too
much. What I'm mainly looking for
IS the learning experience and maybe
to establish a name for myself for the
future.”

One unfortunate yet uncontrolla-
ble aspect of the NCAAS is their

_     .. 

placement in the Pitt academic
schedule. Noted Klafter, “Last
year's [competitions] were put dur-
ing finals week, and this year's really
aren't too much better for those who
need the time to study.”

The competition will take place
Friday through Sunday. Friday will
be the initial team and individual
events. Saturday will involve the
team finals, and Sundays competi-
tion will feature the individual finals
with the top eight from each particu-
lar event qualifying.

Signals scrambled for bout

 Top Rank, Inc. and Joe Hand
‘ romotions will be using a new
sophisticated computer system to
scramble the signal of the April 15
world middleweight title fight
between Marvelous Marvin Hagler
and Thomas Hearns. The fight will
be telecast via satellite in encoded
form on closed-circuit and selected
pay-per-view systems to l,l40 loca-
tions, including the Pittsburgh Civic

. rena. Two 15x20 foot screens, one
each at the north and south ends of
the arena, will provide excellent
viewing of the fight.

Both Top Rank, lnc. and Joe
Hand Promotions are making every
effort to ensure patrons that recep-
tion problems will not occur. Bob
Arum, the promoter and chairman
of the board at Top Rank, lnc., has
contracted Oak Satellite Systems of
Ranchero Bernardo, Calif., to pro-
vide the new ORION Scrambler and

BING

Encryption System for the event.
This particular scrambler and deliv-
ery system is the most sophisticated
ever developed.

Video Star Connections, lnc., of
Atlanta, Ga., will provide the satel-
lite system in the ORION encryption
system. The Civic Arena as well as
all other closed-circuit locations will
be equipped with a satellite and a
backup signal via TELCO Lines,
which will provide a smooth transi-
tion and a clear picture ifthe satellite
system fails for any reason. This
backup system will not need to be
encrypted.

All ofthe equipment to be utilized
in the telecast of this closed-circuit
fight will be tested five days before
the fight (April l0-l5) from the point
of origin to the point of reception.
This procedure will seekiout and
correct any problems. As an added
precaution, a helicopter located in

Nike sponsors clinic here

By Bob Bordas
For The Pitt News

Keeping apace with the ever-
changing game of basketball is not
easy. Ideas and concepts which
worked yesterday may be outdated
today. One of the best solutions?
The NIKE Championship Basket-
ball Clinic.

For the third consecutive year, the
Marriott/Greentree Hotel in Pitts-
burgh will host the gathering. Open
to men’s and women’s coaches of all
levels, the clinic will be held April
12-14.

In the past, the event has attracted
some of the brightest minds in the
game. This year is no exception, as
University of Arkansas coach Eddie
Sutton and his counterpart from
Nevada-Las Vegas, Jerry Tarkan-
ian, will be on hand.

Sutton, a student ofthe legendary
Henry lba, will speak on “Razor-
back Basketball.” He arrived at
Arkansas in 1974 and built his pro-

Classic!

gram on defense, discipline and ded-
ication. This philosophy paid off
immediately as the Razorbacks
recorded their most wins (17) in 16
years.

The victories have been ﬂowing
ever since. Arkansas has won 21 or
more games in nine consecutive sea-
sons and has been to nine straight
NCAA tournaments. Only North
Carolina can match this string of
successive NCAA appearances.

Sutton’s 1 1-year record at Arkan-
sas is a dazzling 260-75 (.776), and
his Southwest Conference mark is
an even more impressive 137-35
(.797). Both of those winning per-
centages are tops among Southwest
Conference coaches. A Final Four
participant in 1978, the 49-year-old
Sutton has been named national
Coach of the Year twice and has
been voted the conference’s top
coach four times.

Like Sutton, Tarkanian’s success
speaks for itself. In 17 years of
coaching, he has compiled an .810
(406-96) winning percentage to rank
as the most-winning active coach in
the nation. Voted Coach of the Year

by UPI in 1982-83, Tarkanian has
been to 10 NCAA tournaments and,

two National Invitation tourna-‘

merits.

His most successful season was in
1977 when he guided UNLV to a
third-place finish in the NCAA
Tournament. The most-winning
coach in the Pacific Coast Athletic
Association history with a .916 (88-
8) success rate, he holds the distinc-
tion of never having lost a home
game in his five years at Long Beach
State. Ifthat isn’t enough, only once
in his 17-year tour of duty did a
Tarkanian-coached team fail to wing
20 games. Who better to discuss
“Pressuring the Defense with the
Running Game“ than the architect
of the Running Rebels?

Joining Sutton and Tarkanian in
Pittsburgh will be George Raveling
(Iowa), J.D. Barnett (Virginia Com-
monwealth), Joe Mullaney (Provi-
dence), Bob Staak (Xavier), Jim
O’Brien (St. Bonaventure), Pat
Kennedy (Iona), P.J. Carlesimo
(Seton Hall), Bill Foster (Miami)
and Debbie Ryan (Virginia,
women).

All coaches in attendance will
receive a sport bag valued at $20, a
coaches’ clinic clipboard and dia-
gram pad, and a coaches’clinic sou-
venir T-shirt. These and other prizes
awarded are compliments of NIKE.
The clinic fee is $35 for pre-
registration and $40 at the door.
Pre-registration deadline is April 11.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, April 10, I985

Mini-biographies :
1985 Pitt football recruits talented

DARREL WOODS (DE/6-
3/220 Elizabeth H.S./Newark,
NJ.)

Leading tackler on the team with
85 hits, three caused fumbles and
nine sacks  high school coach
Robert Torescl on Woods: “I've
never seen Tony Woods play, but
people tell me that Darrel compares
favorably with him. Darrel just
caused havoc on the ﬁeld. He is the
hardest hitter I’ve ever seen, and he
has the quickest feet l’ve ever seen.
He's like a cat — he’s all over the
field. There have been-times when he
was rushing the quarterback, and
the quarterback got the ball off, and
Darrel would be there when the ball
came down. He’s 6-3, 220, and he
has been timed at 4.5'in the forty.
Darrel is a Lawrence Taylor-type
player. He catches people from
behind. He was a two-year starter
for us, and he played some center
offensively. Darrel can make a mis-
take and make up for it. He’s hit
some people that I didn’t think
would get up.”

DARRIN GILLASPIE
(WR/6-3/180 ,Wilmer Hutchins
H.S./ Dallas, Tex.)

A two-year starter and a unani-
mous all-district selection as ajunior
and senior  a seven—foot high-
jumper in track and a member of
sprint relay teams  high school
coach Radford Taylor on Gillaspie:
“Darrin hasn’t been able to play
spring ball the past two years
because he was on the track team.
He’s a three-sport letterman, and I
think his best football is in front of
him. His potential is unlimited. He

has great speed, and he’s a good
blocker on the line of scrimmage and
down ﬁeld. He has very good work
habits. He has great speed and very
good moves. He’s a tremendous
deep threat. Some people have a
second gear. Darrin does, and he can
put it away.

CHRISTOPHER GOETZ

(Line/6-4/270 St. Francis H.S./
Jackson Heights, N.Y.)

Voted outstanding offensive line-
man in the Senior Bowl after playing
defense most of the year  high
school coach Vincent O’Connor on
Goetz: “Chris was goingto play both,
ways for us, but he hurt an ankle in
an early season scrimmage, and I
didn’t want him to push off of his
ankle playing both ways. Chris is
one of the few players in the last 10
years in this league to start as a
sophomore. And he was All-
Catholic League as a junior and
senior. When Chris was a junior we
went undefeated and won the league
title and the state championship. A
lot of that had to do with Chris’
defensive play. We were 6-2-l last
season, and I think that had to do
with not being able to use Chris both
ways. Chris overpowered the people
he played against. He is a strong
player, and he has a great team atti-
tude and a great personal attitude.

Vania/Ohio All-Star game  once

CHRISTOPHER ROSS
(DAB/6-0/175 Ambridge H.S./
Baden, Pa.)

Played slotback and strong safety
 gained 455 yards rushing on 16
carries  had five interceptions and
recovered three fumbles  high
school coach Frank Antonini on
Ross: “Chris was probably the most
consistent defensive player we had.
He has an excellent presence of_mind
on the field, and he is able to read
offenses well. I think he will make a
great free safety. He has a nose for
the football. He was a three-year
starter for us, and he’s still a young
kid. I don’t think he has reached his
full peak as a player yet. He‘s such a
good athlete that if our quarterback
hadn’t come through for us, Chris
could’ve played quarterback. We
had seven kids sign with major col-
leges, and Chris was probably the

most talented of those seven. He’s
6-1 now, and if he grows a couple
more inches, he could play tight
end."

ANTHONY SIRAGUSA
(Line/6-5/240 David’ Brearley
H.S./Kenilworth, N.J.)

First team All-State All Groups in
New Jersey  All-County  All-

formation for six first downs (74

converting 15 of 18  high school
coach Robert Taylor on Siragusa:
“Anthony is one of the finest young
men we ever had in our school. He is
very charismatic and he has great
potential as an athlete. He’s going to
be a leader in the Pitt program just
as he was in our program. We’re very
happy he chose Pitt. We know he’s
the type of person you need to main-
tain the high level of standards there.
Anthony is a unique, high-calibre
athlete.”

VCARNEL SMITH (LB/6-

Was the team’s leading tackler as

All-District  All-State  captain
of the basketball team  high school
coach Johnny Hutton on Smith:
“He is respected as one of the most
outstanding men in town. He was
vice-president of the junior class.
Just an all-around excellent young
man. As for his play on the football
field, there's just one word: awe-
some. He was the best defensive
tackle I saw on the football ﬁeld the
last two years. Regardless of who we
were playing Carnel dominated. He
will probably be one of the best line
men to ever come out of the school.
If there was one kid on the team we
couldn’t play without, it was Carnel.
He was a co-captain. I have a heck of
a lot of respect for Came]. I think the
people of Pittsburgh will be proud of
him. He is a good student and well
mannered.”

You spent half of your freshman year trying to
decide if you were oral or anal. Then, in the ﬁnal
chapter, the textbook told you that Freud was

letter to your parents yet; the one in which you

 scolded them for potty-training you so early.

DEAN CALIGUIRE(Line/
6-3/ 250 Montour H.S./ Pittsburgh,
Pa.)

Member of The Press Finest 44
Post-Gazette Fabulous 22  All-
State by both wire services  high
school coach Bill Kriger on Cali-
guire: “Dean possesses good
strength. He benches‘ over 380 lbs.
on the bench press, and he runs very
well for his size. Dean has excellent
character on and off the field. He is
one of the best Division I recruits
that we have had here since Ted
Kwalick, who graduated in ’64-65.
He’s one of the few players that we
could have sent any film from his
senior year to college recruiters. He
was simply the best tackle. He domi-
nated both offensively and defen-
sively."

THOMAS HUEBNER

News Record Top 22 Northern Area
 had 26 catches for 450 yards as a
receiver  ran 40-yard dash in 4.8
seconds  high school coach Jack
McCurry on Huebner: “Thomas is a
big kid who can run well and catch
well. He has only played organized
football for one year, so his future is
ahead of him. He was an excellent
basketball player and we asked him
to try out for football. He came out

-‘and played the tight end position as

well as anyone who has ever played
that position for us. He is still learn-
ing to play. If he reaches his poten-
tial, Pitt will have one heck of a
player.”

best in nation)  high school coach
Kevin Clancy on Grossman: “Burt is
real personable. He is easy to talk to.
On the field, his greatest asset is his
great quickness. He has the strength
that other top recruits have, but he
adds that quickness. He has the abil-
ity to get to the ball. That’s why
everybody in the country wanted
him. He has a real good knack for

recruits

analyzing opponents’ plays. He has
a great reaction toward the ball. I
would say he’s probably the most
talented athlete we've ever had at
our school in years.”

ROMAN MATUSZ (Linc/
6-6/265 Seton Hall Prep/ Newark
NJ.)

Led team to an 8-2 record  two-
year starter  played both ways 
made 68 tackles, broke up four
passes and recovered three fumbles
 high school coach Tony Verducci
on Matusz: “We ran our fullback
over Roman‘s side in our wishbone
offense, and the fullback gained over
1,000 yards. Roman was very impor-
tant to our offense. I would compare
his abilities to those of Fralic. He’s a
super blocker, and he has exception-
ally quick feet and quick hands. He
just knows how to block, and that’s
probably the hardest thing to teach a
high school player. He’s a tenacious
blocker. He’s glued to his man when
he makes contact. Roman has great
hip extension, drive and follow-
through — the things you don't nor-
mally find in a high school player.”

MARK PEARCE (Line/
6-5/245 0.D. Wyatt H.S./Fort
Worth,Tex.)
Two-technique tackle  basically
a defensive player, although played
offense in goal-line situations  had
91 tackles and seven sacks  named
All-District  All-Metro (Dallas-
Fort Worth)  All-Tarrant County
.. one of Star Telegram’s Top 100
recruits in Texas  recruited by
Texas Tech, TC U, Rice and Texas at
Arlington.

JEROME OLSAVSKY
(LB/6-2/210 Youngstown H.S./
Youngstown, Ohio)

A four-year starter  played both
ways as a junior and senior  won
the Mike DeNiro Award as the top
defensive lineman in the city two-
time All-City selection  started 30
consecutive games  averaged eight
solo tackles and 10 assists per game,
has eight sacks and caused six fum-
bles while recovering two  high
school coach Ed Matey on
Olsavsky: “Gerry is a great kid and a
bluechip ballplayer. He’s aggressive
and intelligent, and he’s always
around the ball. I'm sure that he will
be a real asset to Pittsburgh’s pro-
gram.” John Kovach of The
Youngstown Vindicator: “He ranks
among the best linebackers I’ve seen.
I have seen him get blocked out on
one side of the field and then make
tackle on the other side of the field.”

JOHN MURRAY_ (WR/5-
10/170 Steubenville H.S./ Steuben-
ville, Ohio)‘

All-OVAC  All-State 2nd team
 All-Eastern Buckeye League 
led team to 13-0 record and Division
2 State Championship  placed
second in three track events at the ,
states (300 lows, long jump and 400
relay)  played quarterback as a
junior  high school coach Reno
Saccoccia on Murray: “John’s a

first-class person. When it came

down to the nitty-gritty, we went to
him. In the city championship, we
were trailing 7-6 with time running
out. We ran nine plays and seven
were passes to John. He caught six
of the seven, including the touch-
down with nine seconds to go. ”

MICHAEL HADLEY
(DB/5-ll/170 Woodrow Wilson/
H.S. Camden, NJ.)

All-South Jersey  All-Group
ILL high school coach Joe
Famille on Hadley: “Michael is a
very exciting player. He’s a big play
player. He can really make things
happen. I would guess that Pitt will
play him somewhere where he can
get his hands on the ball. He is the
type of player that can bust things
open. I think that’s what Pitt was
looking for and that’s why they were
attracted to him. He ran the offense
really well for us as our
quarterback."

sensitive and highly motivated per-
son. He’s a great athlete and a good
person. I think he‘ll fit in well at
Pittsburgh. He's got a lot of com-
mon sense. You can talk to him. As
far as athletics are concerned, he’s
got a lot of potential.”

BRIAN DAVIS (RB/5-

ton, Pa.)
Parade All-America co-captain 
high school coach Guy Montecalvo
Q on Davis: “Definitely the most out-
standing high school player l’ve ever
been associated with. Brian com-
bines so many attributes that you
look for in a great back. He can run
inside, and he is just as elusive in the
open field. He combines all those

things. He can run tough inside . I i

from this. He’s one of the quickest
kids we’ve ever had. His quickness
and ability will carry him through
his four years at Pitt. Because his
personality is a fun-loving one, we
were afraid that he wouldn’t be
mean enough. That wasn’t the case.
He has made steady progress, some-
thing we almost expected."

ROBERT BRADLEY
(DB/5-10/185 Elizabeth H.S/ Eli-
zabeth, N.J.)

Played cornerback and quarter-
back  a three-year starter at cor-
nerback  in ’84 had 42 hits and four
interceptions  had 20 interceptions
in three years  high school coach
Robert Torescl on Bradley: “Robert
was the reason why we went 6-3.
He’s the guy who was throwing, run-
ning and scoring touchdowns. He’s a

 very intelligent player. He’s strong,

Wand he comes up and hits people.
Robert returned three interceptions
for touchdowns, and it was just a
case of him knowing when to break
on the ball. He knows where he is on
the field, and he knows how to posi-
tion the other players. He was just
like having another coach on the
field. You won’t find a finer young
man.”
STEVEN HUGHES (QB/.6-
3/185 East Brunswick H.S./ East

__}Brunswick, NJ.)

As a senior, completed 134 of 227
passes for 1,733 yards and 21 touch-
downs to lead his team to a 10-1
record and the Central Jersey Group
IV State Championship game
two-year school Coach Marcus
Borden on Hughes: “Steve’s
strength is that he has a quick
release, much like Dan Marino. As a
matter of fact, he had a chance to
work with Dan at a summer football
camp. Steve can get the ball there
quickly, and he knows how to work
out of ajam. He stays in the pocket,
