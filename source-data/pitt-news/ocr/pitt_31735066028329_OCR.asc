Turmoil surrounds Piﬂ Dental School

    

By Christopher Lawrence
Staff Writer

Charlotte Celidonia is a die-hard Panther
fan. She holds season tickets for football and
has attended every home game this year.
Being laid off under questionable circum-
stances by the ur1iversity’s School of Dental
Medicine hasn’t detracted from her love of
Pitt.

Although she refuses to return to, her
duties at the SDM, which included register-
ing students and coordinating the Integrated
Student Information System, Celidonia said
she would gladly work for Pitt again.

The alumni, faculty and students have said
they would love to have her back. Over 250
people associated with the SDM signed a
petition last May asking the Dental School’s
administration to reinstate her.

The petition described the firing as “an
extreme autocratic act by the administra-

tion.” The school says Celidonia was
released due to “administrative restructur-
ing,” but the petitioners say her termination
was the result of a personality conflict
between Celidonia and her supervisor,
Albert Whitehead.

The fact that Celidonia was not reinstated
didn’t surprise some members of the SDM
faculty. They expect this type of behavior
from a school which over the past ﬁve years
has been characterized as an oppressive
place run by autocratic administrators.

Since his arrival from the University of
Maryland in 1989, some faculty members
have accused Dean Jon Suzukiof harass-
ment, favoritism and intimidation.

“The issues are still there,” said Mark
Ginsburg, president of Pitt’s United Faculty.
“They haven’t gone away.”

The SDM is polarized over the situation,
and opinions about the extent of the division
vary. Dean Suzuki’s supporters claim that

the opposition comes from a small group of
“disgruntled” individuals, basic scientists
who are uncomfortable on a staff made up
primarily of dentists. His visible critics say
that they are the few who “dare speak pub-
licly.” _

Some faculty members have refused to
speak out against the administration because
they “expect reprisals if they voice their
opinions for possible improvements in the
school that do not reflect the administration’s
desires.”

A 1994 University Senate survey yielded
mixed opinions about Suzuki. lt asked facul-
ty to respond to a statement that Suzuki
“inspires and leads the dental school in
defining its goals.”

Over half the faculty members responded

. negatively to that question.

“Friesell put Pitt intothe mainstream of dentistry.” said
Centennial Chairman Dennis Ranalli.

A report released in 1926 by the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching gave Pitt a Class-A rating, the highest
rank attainable.

Pitt Hospital Unit 27, originally formed during World War I,
was reorganized in 1942 and called into active duty in the Second
World War. Six members of the dental school faculty were part of
the unit.

In 1967, a remodeled Salk Hall was dedicated and the university
formally changed the school’s name to the School of Dental
Medicine. Until then, the school was located in different places.
most notably in a German club which was converted into a dental
inﬁrmary after World War I. The building is now the Gardner Steel
Conference Center.

In the same year, the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS)

was changed to Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD).
’ Jon Suzuki was selected as dean of the SDM in 1989. Since he
assumed the deanship, the educational curriculum of the students
has been elevated, the school has attained a reputation for research.
and the operations in the dental clinic have become more “patient
friendly.”

According to Ranalli, the centennial ‘gives us a chance to see
our past, see where we are now and look towards the future.”

Suzuki said he sees two different approaches for the SDM as it
moves into the 21st Century. He foresees the development of strate-
gies to make the school’s dental services available to the public at a
much greater level and said he expects the school to make continu-
ing advancements in the ﬁeld of dental research.

Centennial events are planned throughout the year, with at least
one event scheduled per month. There will also be mini-reunions
and smaller celebrations organized by the various SDM depart-
ments. The centennial will conclude with another keynote speaker
and a series of activities, including the burial of an updated time
capsule. ‘ ' '

After 100 years of service, the SDM claims a position as a major
contributor to the advancement of dental research. education and
training in western Pennsylvania.

Flat rate for cops at student run dances in the Union

 By Danielle Shuster
l Staff Writer

Starting Nov. 1, student organizations that have
‘i dances in the William Pitt Union will pay a flat
‘ rate of $200 for outside police to patrol.

Last Thursday, members of the Student

Government Board, Black Action Society and .

Panhellenic Association met with Leon Haley, vice
chancellor for student and public affairs, and Joe
lCavalla, director of the Office of Student Affairs,
to discuss the current William Pitt Union dance
policy.  .
As it stands, the policy requires groups that use
the union for dances and par_ties to have police
officers patrolling if students from other schools

attend the function. Each of these officers earns
$28.65 per hour, with the student organization that
sponsors the party picking up the tab.

Under the new policy the requirement of three
police officers will remain, but the group will only
have to pay $200 regardless of the amount of time
the work. -

Haley and Cavalla said they believe that student
groups hosting parties in the union are doing a ser-
vice for Pitt by providing a non—alcoholic social
outlet. They would like to keep costs down for

those events.

“The reconsideration of the policy shows that the
university is keeping true to their promise of a
non—alcoholic campus,” said Creighton
Moorehead. SGB member, after Monday night’s

SGB meeting.

Also at Monday night’s SGB meeting, the fight
to save student aid was discussed.

This past weekend SGB member Keith Campbell
and Brian Hefron. new chairman of the
Governmental Relations Committee, traveled to
Penn State University for the Commonwealth
Council of Student Governments meeting.

At that meeting, the Penn State student govern-
ment issued a challenge to collect more signatures
for a petition to Gov. Tom Ridge to save student
aid. '

Anyone who is interested in signing this petition
may do so in the SGB office, located in Room 639
William Pitt Union. or in the Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid, Bruce Hall.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, October 25, 1995

‘From page I

Pitt economist Thomas Rawski, an expert on the Chinese
economy, disagrees. He said the conference had very little effect
on China, where recent questions of human rights violations
have been highlighted in American press.

“The stories [about the conference] in the Chinese press
focused on how successful the conference was, how the orga-
nizers did a wonderful job, how the delegates got so much out
of it,” said Rawski.

About fifteen years ago, the Chinese Socialists began promot-
ing the equality of men and women under the slogan: “Women
Hold Up Half of Heaven.” But it was simply not the case that
responsibilities were equally divided between men and women,
Rawski pointed out.

In the past fifteen years, the range of areas under the control
of the government has narrowed", and the range of decisions
being made by private companies has expanded.

“Enterprises can now control who the labor force is, and a
reﬂection of people’s actual feelings, as opposed to some slo-
gan, is coming out,” said Rawski.

Rawski is quick to add that it’s not that there aren’t women
achieving high positions in companies in the government, but
popular attitude in China is strongly in favor of men.

“The traditional popular culture has a strongly paternalist

nature, which years of ‘Women Hold Up Half of Heaven’ pro-

paganda has not changed.” said Rawski. “Changing popular atti-
tudes is a much slower process.” _

The unemployment of women was highlighted as an impor-
tant issue at the Beijing conference. Rawski expects unemploy-
ment to rise, probably at an increasing rate and possibly at the
expense of women.

“That women are bearing the brunt of unemployment is said
to be true. In many Chinese organizations, they prefer to have
men than women. It’s not implausible,” said Rawski.

Rawski also points to things that women could lose as the A

Chinese economy becomes more independent. subsidized day
care being a prime example.

“Enterprises are being run more and more like businesses,
with a focus on profitability. They look at subsidized day care
and say, ‘Why are we doing this? ‘We pay them wages.” said
Rawski.

‘He adds that it could go either way and will be left to the
companies to decide if workers work better if they don’t have to

worry about picking up their children after work or if the baby— V

sitter will be on time. He points out the cost burden on these
companies as one possible reason families would lose care.

Mrs. Clinton spoke of human rights at the conference, high-
lighted last night by Rusinow, but Rawski believes that many

, Chinese do not understand the complaints about human rights. I

He‘ points to the across—the-board improvements in that area.

The Chinese now have freedom of speech. association and T

religion. The economy is free, and they have local elections.

“Most horror stories are true, but the victims of these are a
tiny, tiny minority,” said Rawski. '

He points out that there is no guarantee that “the way we do
things around here is the proper way.” There are social problems
and human rights issues in our country as well.

“My Chinese friends say they wish the US Congress would
stop being the World Congress,” said Rawski.

There will be a Women in Development seminar March 14-17

to explore “Gender and Development Beyond Beijing” for all

who are interested.

were critical of the survey and
"said that it shouldn't be taken
seriously. Suzuki said the survey
was “entirely governed by the
Senate faculty, most of whom
encompass the disgruntled facul-
ty within the schoo 

Suzuki pointed to a recent vote
on SDM bylaws as a better
assessment of his standig. The
new bylaws, developed last year
reflect the new organizational
plan of the school.

The institution of these bylaws
followed one of the more contro-
versial events of Suzuki’s tenure.

In June 1994, the Senate
Budget Policies Committee
released a report which conclud-
ed there were “serious ﬂaws” in
the planning and budgeting reor-
ganizationiof the SDM.

They discovered participation
between administration and fac-
ulty was limited, reflecting
“unawareness or neglect.”

The report concluded that
these flaws crated a “major
departure from the collegiality,
openness and accountability
which the PBS seeks to encour-
age.”

Detre said that Suzuki has cor-
rected the ﬂaws that the SPBC‘
pointed out, but John Baker,
associate professor of microbiol-
ogy/biochemistry in the SDM

 and one of Suzuki’s most out-

spoken critics, said that the PBS
situation is just another example
of Suzuki disobeying university
rules and regulations. _ ,
“Dean Suzuki has changed the

I way things have been “done in

the school,” Baker said. “He just
does whatever he wants.”

Last year, Pitt’s Office of
Budget, Planning and Analysis
released a report on average fac-
ulty raises at the university.

According to the report, the .

SDM had the lowest average
increase, at 2.48 percent.
University wide, the average
increase was 3.46 percent

The minimum increase for a
faculty members who are judged
by their supervisor to have7per-
formed satisfactorily was two
percent. Of the 96 members of
the university faculty who
received raises below the mini-
mum, 28 were from the SDM’.
While some SDM ‘faculty

. received no raises, four received

increases greater than or equal to
eight percent.

Salary raises in the SDM are .

determined by merit There are
ﬁve divisions in the school, and
the heads of each division are
responsible for determining the
raises of their faculty.

“As dean, I don’t have time to
go evaluate each single member

. of the faculty,” Suzuki ‘said. “I

usually do not tamper with the
recommendations that the divi-
sion heads make.”

Suzuki’s critics have com-
plained that the dean has violat-
ed the integrity of the dental

’ school by ignoring university

guidelines for hiring and promo-
tions. ’

In a 1994 letter to then-Interim
Provost ‘Mark Nordenberg, the
faculty members critical of

, ‘Suzuki said the dean has “fre-
‘quently -appointed inexperi-
2 -fenced.-_-glinderqualiﬁed faculty ‘to V J 

important positions in the dental
school, in the process, bypassing

_ or replacing more capable senior
faculty.”

“Dean Suzuki rewards loyal-
ty,” Baker said. “People who
have been loyal have gotten very
good pay raises, promotions and
opportunities to chair a depart-
ment or become a division
hea .” i ' ‘

Critics use Suzuki’s removal
of Professor Teh-Hsing Chiu

.from his position as the acting

chair of the Department of

cMicrobiology/Biochemistry as

an example. Suzuki replaced
Chiu with Associate Professor
Sudha Agarwal. Agarwal was
Suzuki’s research assistant pro-
fessor at the University of
Maryland Dental School.

Atthe same time Agarwal was
promoted, -Suzuki appointed

of Microbiologyfﬂiochennisuy.

any tenured faculty in the depart-
ment, a violation of the guide-
lines in the dental’school’s book-
let “Policy and Procedures for
the Appointment and Promotion
of Faculty in the Tenure
Stream.”

Suzuki said he replaced Chiu,
who is still a full professor in the
Department of
Microbiology/Biochemistry,
because he felt Agarwal was
“positioned better to compete for
grants.”

Baker said that the under-
staffing of the departments has
led to low morale on the staff.
The relatively high proportion of
unﬁlled facultypositions has led
some faculty to believe that the
school may have a problem
passing its accreditation review
in 1996. I '

One of the categories the
accreditation review looks at is
the faculty-to-student ratio in the
climcal disciplines.

have left the SDM in the past
two years. Approximately 20
faculty members have either left
Pitt or retired early during
Suzuki’s administration, and a
number of full-time faculty have
been reduced to part-time posi-
tions.

Suzuki believes the school is
poised to do very well on the
accreditation. “It’s very key to
the future of the school,” he said.

If Pitt fails the accreditation,
the graduates of the SDM cannot

be licensed to practice dentistry.

“If we fail, we’ll essentially be

While Suzuki’s critics level
some harsh claims, they are not
immune to attack themselves.
On Jan. 19, anonymous posters
appeared throughout Salk Hall
which condemned the “Baker’s
Dozen.”

The poster denounced Baker
and other faculty members who
had signed a letter to the

policy, persons criticized in a let-
ter receive a copy of the letter in
advance so they can prepare a
response to be published in the
same issue. According to the
Times, the posters appeared three
hours before the issue containing
the letter was delivered to Salk.
Suzuki described Baker’s
complaints as a “diatribe” and
said that his allegations have
been thoroughly investigated.

“Dr. Baker is a very disgrun— -

tled faculty member,” Suzuki
said. “He’s taken great pains to
look for activities that are
unorthodox, or he’s looked for
some leverage to vent his frus-
trations.”

Baker and his colleagues say
they are seeking a resolution of

past grievances and that they’re '

going to continue to fight until
they get them.

‘Case of the fatal poultry

INCOMINGI Takelcoverl You never know what might fly
through the air these days. It would seem modern science has
now made postmortem ﬂight possible. So watch out around
you, and duck (or should we say chicken?).

That’s what one woman found out in a Hempfield super-
market recently —- that even dead chickens can fly. She was
struck by the fly—and-run frozen bird while waiting in the
checkout line of a grocery store. The four-pound death trap
hit her on the ankle, and now she is suing the.store._ 9

Heidi Beltzman, the victim of the vicious birding, was in a
wheelchair (for an unknown reason) when she was attacked.
Apparently, the chicken began its attack as the result of the
checkout clerk’s “bagging groceries too fast for conditions”
(Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Oct. 24.). It was dark and stormy,
and visibility was low  the clerk should have been more
careful. '

The suit currently filed in Westmoreland County Common
Pleas Court claims the clerk was negligent. He,‘ supposedly,
was attempting to casually toss the ﬂyer (oops  make that
fryer) into the bag when it missed the bag and struck
Beltzman’s ankle. Thesuit, however, does not even mention
the perpetrator’s (clerk’s) name.

After all, it wouldn’t make much sense to sue a person who
works as a grocery clerk, would it? No, no, no. The people
with the money are not the ones who commit these heinous
assaults with deadly chickens. Instead, we should always
remember the lesson —— sue the one with the most money.
The grocery store where the incident happened is probably
going to lose"a lot of money because of an accident.

There is no doubt the clerk made a mistake. But have you
ever.held a frozen chicken? They can be slippery little devils.
It is entirely possible the thing just slipped. Of course, the
clerk was probably trying to show off a bit with a casual toss
of the bird. And that does make him careless. In a legal
sense, it also makes him negligent.

But. really, does being struck accidentally by a four-pound

 chicken justify tying up the courts and creating a huge ordeal

for all parties involved? It might be understandable if the
clerk had, say, pitched the bird at Beltzman’s head. But he
didn’t.

Beltzman learned her lesson from the infamous

" McDonald’s coffee trial. Or maybe she read about the burglar

who won a case against the owners of the house he was try-
ing to break into. (He fell through their skylight and got hurt,
then sued and won.) If you are involved in an accident, don’t
even consider looking the other way. Sue, and sue for every-
thing you can get! Turning the other cheek is, sadly, now just
an anachronism.

It is ashame that this country is so damn litigation happy,
but it is. The reforms currently being considered in Congress
to limit awards in cases like Beltzman’s and the McDonald’s

' coffee incident are, unfortunately, necessary to stop this silli-

ness. But in the meantime, keep your eyes open. You never
know when a pizza will animate into a spinning wheel of
death.

Censorship for one

What
d 0
con-
’serv' ' es and
liberals have
in common?
A: Far
too much, as
far as I’m
concerned.

Chesnavich While 1
would like to

 

rip apart all of these similarities,

however, I only have room for
one here, and the one on my
mind right now is censorship.

Both liberals and conserva-
tives embrace this in some
forms, yet simultaneously claim
it is a partisan issue. They both
agree too much that there should
be restrictions placed on “offen-
sive” speech; they only disagree
on what that is. Yet the impor-
tant question is: does offensive
speech actually have no value?
This is an important question, as
the Supreme Court determined
that the only type of speech
which can be regulated is that
which has no “socially redeem-
ing importance.”

Well, the first answer to this
question is, “It shouldn’t mat-
ter.” Protection from offense is
something which is neither con-
stitutionally protected nor rea-
sonable to‘ demand from others;
it is akin to legally forcing oth-
ers to mold their behavior
around your whims. An ex-girl-
friend of mine who openly
favored flag-burning was
offended by people who. wore
any reproduction of the U.S.
ﬂag. Who is supposed to cave in
to whom? Neither, of course:

even if their message had no
value, there is ‘no reason they .-

have to make another person
more comfortable through their
silence. Think about this idea if
you are “offended” by gays
kissing in public. After all, what
if they are offended by straights
doing the same? '

A second answer is that offen-
sive speech, by its nature, still
contains. a message (if not,

what’s offending you?), and the
entire point of the “freedom of
speech” clause was to allow for
the free dispersal of these mes-
sages. Thus the answer is yes, it
does have a value. Despite this
answer, however, both political
extremes still take up their own
censorial crusades. And in every
instance, they are wrong.

The left tries to ban different
forms of hate speech, throw out
entire stacks of student newspa-
pers because they are deemed
offensive to women or develop
an entire vocabulary system all
its own designed to stay away
from even the most slightly
offensive words.
(“Freshperson”?, Please.)
Saturday Night Live was sued a
few years back for its “Delta
Delta Delta” routine. Deal with
it, ladies —— sarcasm and criti-
cism are a way of life, and per-
fectly fair.

The right attempts to ban
movies, music, literature and
even multimedia that don’t have
the recommended daily
allowance of Family
Values(tm). They attempt to
suppress the expressions of any
negative or even different feel-
ings about the United.States
(ﬂag-burning, for example), the
Catholic Church (the movie
Priest generated protests and
even some physical threats) or
government. (In some countries
the book “l984” is banned, a
dazzling display of self—parody.)

Where both sides get it wrong
is in the assumption that
expressing some form of dislike
for their own favorite group or

idea has no value and only dam- .

ages. On the contrary, it is pre-
cisely because of the nature of
offensive speech that it must be
protected. '

All forms of expression send
a message, intended or not. If
nothing else, they send a mes-
sage about the intentions of the
messenger. Think about that
hate-speech I mentioned. How
would you even know about
hatred if its expression were

and all

suppressed? As longas there is
a message, it must not be inter-
fered with. Someone else may
want to hear it and, in fact, may
agree with it (or may be con-
firmed further in their opposite
viewpoint, an equally important
function). Interfering with this
process is nothing more than
thought—policing, a right no one
has regardless of the message.

Furthermore, both sides use
the argument that offensive
expression can lead people to
certain types of behavior, many
of which are destructive. Even
though there is little evidence
that this happens (most proofs
lack a true cause-and-effect cor-
relation), this still wouldn’t be
an argument for censorship if
true. Some might not be able to
disseminate information correct-
ly, but I sure can, and I demand
to be allowed to; those who give
me information are not respon-
sible for how I react to it. If I
were in England, I would be
really annoyed by the fact that I
couldn’t watch A Clockwork
Orange simply because it incit-
ed other people to mimic its
characters. and being an
American, I don’t care what
incites people to sexual crimes
— I don’t commit them, and I
want my smut, dammit!

Think whatever you want
about whatever you want. Hate
gays, hate the Pope, hate me for
all I care. Just don’t let either
side stop you from expressing it
— THAT is offensive.

I once heard an interesting
political theory. It states that the
political spectrum is not a line
but rather a circle in which the
far left circles around to meet
the far right. As someone who
has hovered on the other end of
the circle for some time now.
I’m beginning to see the truth in
that.

Lewandowski ma

By Nichole Gantshar
Staﬂ" Writer

_,Most seniors worry about grad-
uation.

Sunday Lewandowski doesn’t
think about May, and especially
not about June. In June, she will
climb up three meters, bend her
knees in order to vault off the
board and snap off two—and—a—
half somersaults to ﬁnish entering
the water in a straight line. . _

If she has one of the top two
dives that day, Sunday" .
Lewandowski will go to the
Olympics.

Lewandowski has a dilemma.
Last summer she made the U.S.
National Diving Team and had a ‘
chance to compete with the top
athletes in the world on a circuit
of eight competitions in
Germany, Russia and Sweden. It
would have been a great opportu-
nity if there weren’t this thing
called “school”, ‘

“I just can’t justify the travel,”
her coach, Julian Krug, said.

Lewandowski’s year was
planned before classes even start-
ed. There are competitions
almost every weekend in the fall.
Andgthen the ftm starts. The Big
East Championships are in
NCAA

Sunday Lewandowski prepares for a dive.

kes national team

\\ trials the team consists of “who

ever is the top two that day."
Lewandowski said. To prepare
for that day, she must train so that
the movement of every muscle
becomes automatic.

After years of gymnastics and
diving practice, those muscles
know how to work without her
commands. If she’s practicing a
reverse layout, she stands back-
ward, only her toes on the board.
to prepare the dive. If a diver’s

torques the wrong direction. the
dive won’t work. Because of the
hours of practice, it all comes

. together. When Lewandowski
leaves the board, her arched
body, arms opened to the ceiling,
appears to hang motionless in the
air before gravity pulls her out of
the curved trajectory down into
the pool in a perfectly straight
line. On good days, she enters the
water with barely a splash.

The divers practice three days a
week at 5:45 a.m. as well as
every afternoon. They practice
somersaults, inward flips and
standing backward ﬂips on the
ground. Krug spends part of each
morning practice spotting the
divers as they work in a belt, a

How many innings? This
guy was from Rochester, not
Mars, and most Martians
know how many innings are
in a baseball game, anyway.

- How baseball can get so far

beyond any American amazes
me.

Not-solong ago, say when
our grandfathers were work-

‘ing, businesses would post

signs asking all "employees to
file any false funeral and/or
wedding announcements
before 10 a.m. on the day of ‘
the World Series game. It used

* to be important ——- right up

there with Mom, apple pie,
Chevrolet and Lite beer.
Now, the best baseball -
teams in the last decade are
playing a very competitive
World Series, and nobody
notices. The Braves have the

_‘ greatest pitching staff since

Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale
and the 1963 Dodgers. The
Indians are the hardest-hitting
club since Mantle, Maris and
the Yankees in ‘6l. But, ask a
Pitt student what they think -
about the Cleveland/Atlanta
matchup, and they’ll probably
start talking about Vinny
Testaverde and Andre Rison.
There are no good reasons

why. Those who say the game
isn’t exciting enough didn’t
see Kenny Lofton score on a
Randy Johnson wild pitch last
week. And anybody com-

plaining about player/owner
I troubles had better swear off

of every major sportgin
America.

everything goes according to
plan, the Olympic trials in June.
Only two divers will go to
Atlanta. But right ' now,
Lewandowski has to focus on
practice and mid—terrns.

, “I try to go along with my days
and not think about competition,”
Lewandowski said.

There isn’t time for anything
else. “It’s hard to concentrate on
school,” Lewandowski said, “but

_ it keeps me on track and out of

the bars. I don’t have time for it.”
If nothing else, the schedule

“organizes my life so’I’m not

All she can do is wait and train.

fall, and it would have no bearing _

on Lewandowski’s placing.
Despite her All-American titles,
Big East wins and top placing at

makes the elements of a dive

“Dry land training is the key to
your success,” Lewandowski
said. All the divers practice their

year’s Pitt soccer team and is one of the
main people responsible for the team’s
quick start. .

As captain, Gorsin is not a vocal leader
but rather tries to lead by ~

and therefore is usually assigned to cover
the opponent’s best offensive forward. V
As a four—year. letter winner, Gorsin
saidlhe feels comfortable playing the
position, and he likes the challenges of
playing against some of the best players
in the Big East.
Gorsin ‘gave a lot of credit for his suc-
cess to his coaches.
“[The coaches] get us prepared for
every game,” he said. “They help us
' work on our weaknesses tohelp

example._ _

“J.L. is_ obviously a team
leader,” head coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “He epito-
mizes the, attitude we want
on this team.”

Gorsin agreed with his
coach’s‘ assessment.

“My job is to make sure
the team is prepared for each
game,” Gorsin said. “I try to
make sure everyone is
focused, and I try to pick
people up when they are
down,” he said.

”J.Llis obviously

He epitomizes
the attitude we

wanton this T

us prepare. The coaches also
give me the freedom to play
how I want to play on the field.
They let me play my‘ own style
of game. They let me be the
player I am.”

For the most part this
season, the Pitt defense has
' done a good job shutting down

the opponents’ offense.
“Our defense is playing
. really well.” Gorsin said. “I
' enjoy playing with these guys,

defense.”

Gorsin admitted that he is _
not a “rah-rah” type of player, but he is

also very proud to be captain.

“I’m very glad that I’m captain,” he
said. “I was very honored that coach had
enough confidence to select me."

Coach Luxbacher said the decision was
easy. ' I , »

“There really wasn’t a decision for
captain. It was obvious,” said L_-uxbacher.
- Gorsin is the marking-back of the team

. But Gorsin does not give
the defense all the credit for Pitt’s fast
start. He is quick to point out-that the
Panthers’ success is a team effort.

‘_‘Their has been a lot of hard work and
determination on the field. We are really
determined to do well,” Gorsin said.

. He also said that the seniors on this .

year’s team have especially worked hard
to achieve‘ success. V,

Rugby loses to
Mountaineers

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther rugby team lost its last
league game of the season last Saturday,
falling to West Virginia 24-17 and settling
for a 1-3 league record.

In what was the last competitive game
for the senior players, it was a rookie who
stole the show in this contest, which wasn’t
decided until a late score in the final min-
utes. »

The scoring began with a West Virginia
three-point penalty kick in the early going.
Fullback Sean Tonkin knotted the score at
three with a penalty kick of his own soon
after. And senior Dave Jaeger scored the
team’s. first try to give Pitt a 10-3 lead.
West Virginia answered back quickly, and
took the lead at 17-10 with two quick
scores.

Enter freshman center Ryan Steppacher,
who scored his first points of the season
late in the contest to tie the score at 17.

Senior captain Brian Kane called it a
“great try,” saying, “I really see him in the
next year being the best player on the
team.” ‘

Pitt’s glory was short-lived, however.
when WVU answered Ryan’s try under the
two—minute mark to win the contest 24-17.

Jaegar said the contest was “one of the
best rugby games we’ve had all season."
and added, “both teams played real well."

The Pill‘ News plays lcml-usy football

By Sean Duncan and
Mike Kovak
The Pitt News

Sometimes a few shots of
Tanqueray and some freshly picked
tical can make the mind wander. But
we’re pretty sure that the Discovery
Channel announced this week the
formation of two new expansion
franchises in the NFL.

The two cities given teams were
Somerset, Pa., and South Oakland.

. This may arrive as a shock to some,
but when we heard this earth-shatter-
. ing news, we each drafted the best
“ possible lineups for each city and
’ provided team names as well.

Kovak received the first selection
in the draft, and thus received the
first selection in each round. Duncan
received the second selection in each
round. The draft consisted of 27
rounds, after which a head coach was
selected for the respective squads.

The following rosters show posi-
tion, player name and the pick in
which each was selected.

RG — Bigfoot (9): He enjoys a good

use his lightsaber very well. The final
piece to an offensive line that com-
pletely blows the door off of the
Psychos.

The Sixty-Niners Defense:

His strength and endurance are well
documented.

With her 32-foot wingspan, she has
no trouble blocking passes and kicks;
plus, the guys really dig her

He’s been quoted as saying,
“Hasta la vista, Duncan.” Very
deadly, has the killer instinct.

work is a cut above the compe-

Doesn’t like people with facial

“Our guys played really
tough,” Kane said. “They
showed a lot of heart.”

Kane, the team’s normal
ﬂanker, played second row for
the squad on Saturday — one
of many players moved around
due to injuries throughout the

, season. Heath Jones, the team’s

regular fly—half and two-point
conversion kicker, returned for
his ﬁrst game in two weeks.

Of the injuries, Kane said
they “deﬁnitely made a differ-
ence,” adding that the younger
players “tried their best  that’s
all I asked of them.”

On a more positive note,.the

team’s protest over last week’s

loss to Slippery Rock was
upheld by the local rugby
union, giving the squad its only
league win of the season. The
protest was lodged on the
grounds that the Slippery Rock
team used graduate students in
the contest, one of whom was
easily discovered by his broth-
er, a Pitt rugby club member.

mats. In addition, they work on a trampoline. The divers also lift
weights on their own time. So why does she do it?

“She’s a born performer,” Krug said. “Something happens when she
knows that people are watching.”

“Sometimes practice is so hard mentally,” she said, “I depend on
myself to keep myself motivated.”

Lewandowski doesn’t dive to do well or to attain a speciﬁc "place-
ment. While she values being part of a team, ‘‘I’m very much a com-
petitor,” she said. “‘I have to see how I do — against myself and with

' other people.”

Training with other top-competitors at the University of Miami made
last summer one of her career highlights. “It was a blast -—- the best
team in the nation,” she said. At  Lewandowski trained every
day with threeformer olympians and said that “it motivated me so
much.” She watched her diving improve over the summer and wit-
nessed the payoff when she made the national team.

Helping her work for an as yet undetermined payotf this summer, her
coach carefully monitors her progress. If anything is out in place in div-
ing, the dive could fail. This makes divers overly critical. At practice,
Lewandowski joins her teammates in a litany of complaints: “My
shoulders were up. Was I back too far? Was that entry crooked?”

At a normal practice, Krug shouts out a series of encouragements and

corrections. This year he will be careful to ensure that Lewandowski

does not peak too early. He wants her to do well in her ser1ior—year
NCAA appearance, but that’s only in March. “You clearly can’t peak
for six weeks,” he said.

A chance meeting between Krug and l_ewandowski’s father paired
_the coach with Lewandowski and her sister, who is also a diver. “He
said his daughters had done what they could in gymnastics. So I told

' him to bring them down,” Krug said. The pairing worked.

Lewandowski chose to attend Pitt so she could continue to work with
the coach.

Regardless of whether Lewandowski will get to travel to Atlanta
with Krug, the hard work can be seen every time she leaves the diving
board. Krug said, “She’s an All-American and proven she’s one of our

top people.”

Column
‘From page 9

Penguins haven’t a prayer without a solid defenseman or two

and a healthy Mario Lemieux. The NBA doesn’t start for anoth- _

er week, Pitt basketball is far off and it’s a bit early to come
down with Olympic fever.

Well, there’s always college football, but an 0-4 conference
record and a loss to Temple tend to erode a fan base. _

That leaves Major League Baseball, a stranger to the
Pittsburgh area considering how little the Pirates resemble a
Major League Baseball franchise. Despite what the critics will
say, it is exciting to watch Greg Maddux pitch and to see Eddie
Murray, the old warhorse, hit a home run in his first Series in
over a decade. And even if he makes $5 million a year, it is
much more enjoyable to watch Fred McGriff bat that watch Pitt
ﬂub a draw—counter-trapireverse play on third and 15. L

So even if you don’t buy into the history and prestige of base-
ball, even if you don’t know how many home runs Willie Mays
hit (660) or what Babe Ruth’s mid—doubleheader snack was
(pickled eels and ice cream — no joke), you can still give the
game a chance.‘ ’ '

Watch Steve Avery try to regain his form -under the national

spotlight. Watch a young Indian team try todig out of an early

series hole against a veteran playoff dynasty. Watch Charles V
Nagy throw a slurve ball, and try to explain how he does it. Or
how Chipper Jones hits it. Forget about the strikes, salaries and
bad attitudes —— just watch the game.

°From page 9

“We [the seniors] want to
remember the good times and
the winning. I want to think
back on being successful.”

During his four years at
Pitt, Gorsin has experienced
both the highs of victory and
the lows of defeat. As a fresh-
man starter, Gorsin and the
rest of the Panthers did well.
The team had a strong nucle-
us of players and qualified for
the Big East tournament.

‘.‘One of my most memo-

‘ rable feelings here at Pitt was

making it to the Big East
tournament,” Gorsin said.
‘‘That’s what we are striving
for this year.”
' During his sophomore year,
though, Pitt struggled.

“I found out my sophomore
year how hard it was to make
the Big East tournament year

after year.” Gorsin said.

Last year, the Panthers
played well in their out—of~
conference games but strug-
gled in the Big East.

But this year, the team is

near the top of the Big East

and is looking to continue
winning.

“Our attitude has changed
this year. We are a lot more

determined.” Gorsin said. ‘‘I

am very confident for the sec-
ond half of theseason. Our
next couple of games can
make or break our position in
the Big East.”

Gorsin pointed out the win
at Syracuse-on Oct. 8 as a key
game this season. He said
everyone got a lot of confi-
dence after that game.

But since only eight of the_

12 teams-_IT1ak_e the Big East
tournament, Gorsin said the

team realizes that making the
playoffs will require a lot of
hard work.

“lt’s important to make it to
the Big East tournament and
finish well. Our ultimate
goal is to make it to the
NCAA tournament.” Gorsin
said.

Gorsin said he has been
inspired to play well because
his parents have been able to
come to nearly every game.

As a senior at Ringgold
High School near Pittsburgh,
he chose the University of
Pittsburgh because it was
close to home and three of his
closest friends, Jeff Porter,
Todd Graf and Dean Astorino,
also decided on Pitt.

Hopefully this year, we will
all be watching J.L. Gorsin
and the rest of the Pitt soccer
team win the Big East.

Fold-down rear seats - means
you can go places and take

lots of stuff with ya 

Daytime running lamps in '96
- they’re a safety feature, but
hey, they look good too

5-speed transmission and
tubular rear axle with
spring-over shock sport
suspension and progressive
rideytuning — is ‘this a real
set of wheels or what?

%

Single-key lod<ing_- one key

all the fun of Sunfire g

Oh, Courtesy Transportation

Your choice of a great-looking

coupe (shown), sporty four-door

A HUGE glove box - some

whole laptop computer

relationship here é

High-rewing, 120-horsepower,

Clearcoat paint — paint you
