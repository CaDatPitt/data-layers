Prrr RECORDS ARE‘

MAKING BIG HIT
ON CAMPUS

The record of Pitt's ‘two most pop-
ular songs, “Alma Mater” and “Hail
to Pitt,” made by the Starr Phono-
graphl Company of Pittsburgh is
making a hit with students and
alumni. The Musical Club, which has
sole charge of the sale on thecampus
reports that a large number of the
records have been sold and that or-
ders are fast coming in for more.

‘At the W. and J. game last Satur-

day two large ampliﬁers were .placed
on phonographs and the records were
played to the crowds in the stands.
The songs were received with much
applause and the members of the
Musical Club, availing themselves of
the opportunity, went into the stands

 

and .solieited’-uorders  many stué.

dents and alumni.

Manager Little, at -a meeting of
the Musical Olubs stated that the
Musical Clubs have the sole rights
for the sale of the “Pitt’ records on
the campus and that the members of
the club are not selling the record
for private proﬁt but that all money
received from the sale will be placed
in the club’s treasury. Every student
who purchases a record can feel that
he is directly helping the Musical
Clubs to carry out their program of
concerts planned for this season.

Pictures of the combined clubs
taken recently «are ready for sale.
Orders should be left with Manager
Little or at the Brecken’s Studio in

thoLusand1 Pittites’ who had ordered
tickets forthe Lgame. There was a.
returnL.Vl postal card which they were
to_ﬁL11 outand mail back to “EckL”L Mc-
Grew, chairman of the special‘ com-
lnittee‘ in charge of the affair. When

An Annual Feature.

The idea of as gathering place "for
Pittites in the vicinity of Forbes
Field the day of the W. & J. ‘game
seems to have made a big hit with
everyone and it will be an annual
feature of the occasion in future
years, with added features. The Pitt
band was out Saturday and made a
big hit with ‘everyLoVne.1 1 Many of the
“1grads”L had seen the boys on‘. the
field at the gamzes ,—b«uLt*‘* had not had
the opportunity of getting V La "c:lVo-s:e:-
up” of themL.:1 1 V‘ L

‘ The W; & .I;1gaxne, itself, was one
long to be remembered by Pitt-ites.
Qt course,L_gL3,v.ery, 1:01:53 was sorrL1y11.LtVo see
-it-lost‘ (and the writer, penning these
lines Sunday '9 afternoon, is still in
more or less of a. daze over it). Judg-
Ling‘~~Vhy‘ the play of the two ‘teams it
.was anybody’s Vgame and a 0-0 score

& J.’s chance to score should have
glimmered :1 when Pitt men blocked
“Russ” Steinjs . attempt.“ for a ﬁeld
goal. Instead, a break gavethem the
,b‘aLLll again Lwhen a Pitt ‘man let it
slide under 1 him in the mud. This
gave th‘em1 their chance to shoot the
forward pass‘ which won the game.
Pitt: al_umniLL are “gooji sports”
enough to give ‘LW.;j& J._credltLwith
playing a. hard clean fgame and even
it the break did go against us we
will hand them the glad hand of. con-
gratulation.‘ The adherents of the

The Chess Club held its first smoker
in the “Y” but, Thursday evening,
November 10.
games were played with the result
that the Seniors won ﬁrst place, the
freshmen second, the juniors third.
and the Sophomores last. Leo. R.
Hack defeated K. P. Claney in a blind-

 

"fold game by ‘a clever combination in
‘ten moves. In the two main Kruge-

.spiel matches of the evening Frank
and Reiner broke even. Henry Frank
had the best record for the evening,
winning three" games and losing none,
while Claney deserves great credit

 for -two victories over Dunkle cham-

’ pion for the last two‘ years.

A business meeting .,was,. called to
order by the vice-president E. M. Sar-
mi’, and speeches were made by Dr.
Lane, Mr. Hoover of Carnegie Tech,
D. L. Mitchell of the Evening School,
and Mr. Straney, the Y secretary. A
report upon the probable schedule for
the Chess Team was made by the Sec-
retary, Norman J. Harrar. The com-

lmittee in charge of the Smoker was

K. P. Claney, L. N. Loeb, Lr., R.

Hack, and N. J. Harrar. _
Vllilliam Reiner won first place in

the ﬁrst group in the tournament and

‘is now opposed to Dunkle for a place

on the team. Lipsitz and Hack will
play to decide the winner of the sec-
ond group who will oppose Herby
Krow. -.

Krow, Sarraf and Frank will prob-
ably play for the privilege of meet-
ing Harrar, while in the fourth group
Wolstoncroft, Fulton, and Ruderman
are ﬁghting for theiplace left vacant

by Smyers, who is not in school this

x

year. The secretary urges that all
these matches be speeded up so that
deﬁnite dates can be oﬁered to the
teams on the schedule. _

The Inter-class tournament will be

~ started early this season so that it

will be completed in plenty of time.

‘Frank, Clancy, Hack and Dick Hoyt

were appointed to take temp-or9-1'3’
charge of the organization of their
respective class teams. It is requested
that the class captains be elected and
report to the secretary before Thanks-
giving.

ALUMNAE Iillsslr

(By Minnie Z. Buckley, ’15.)

A letter comes from Mrs. John J.
Jarvis, who was Edith Miller, Col.
’02, assuring us that “she is still
interested in alumnae affairs and
wants to keep in touch with them.”
Edith has always been very active-
ly interested in school affairs. She
was on the 1919-1920 Year Commit-
tee. Gne of her pet hobbies in the
Alumni Association was to see Pitt
Women recognized in,A._,C. A.; so
she must have been delighted last
spring, when ‘largely through the
efforts of Dean Amos this" was ac-
complished. A. C. A. holds up a
high standard for College Women
and it was oft times embarrassing
to Pitt Women not to qualify. Just
a few months before we-heard the
good news, Gretchen Buske, Col., '15,
had written from Vallejo, Calif, tell-
ing of what interesting" people she
was meeting‘ there, but decrying the
fact that she was not eligible to
the ‘College Club which required
graduation from a -college admitted
to A. C. A. 'It was not particularly
complimentary to our University that
one of the obstacles we had the
hardest time surmounting was the
fact to be proved that women had
a fair representation on the faculty
and that their standard of reward
was -the same as that for men, But

The Alumnae Mermaids made
their first "appearance of ‘the season
last week at the Trees Pool.‘ That

 

is, some of them did. We are forced

to forgive those of the “Regulars"
who dld not appear, for they were
all earning their little five-dollar
bill by working at the -polls. As
per usual, however, we proved that
numbers mave nothing too do with-
well, noise «for instance. Dorothy
Paulin -can make just as much noise
diving as ten. others together-and
also use the “crawl” better than
most of us; and Helen Donaldson
and her sister, who so kindly chauf-
feured us down the hill, can get as
much action out of a game of chas-
ers in the water than ten others to-
gether. Our next date is November
29, Tuesday after Thanksgiving. We
still insist we have the ﬂnest pool
with the finest water in the city.
Come and try it. If you cannot
swim, come and learn; if you can,
come and show us. This is the best
chance ever to get ready for that
summer trip next year. November
29 will be a. very good date, so de-
lay your marcelle until the thirtieth.

topic of the day was forced into the

Sounds exciting, doesn’t it? Well,
it was, so much so that during a
lull Dr. Ferguson rather peevedly
called for her coffee, to be told by
the waiter that it was before her
and had been for ten minutes.

Meta E-beling, Col., '20, writes
from 1716 North Taylor road, Cleve-

see one game this season; so thought
that one would be a good one to go
for. If I do come I will try to get
to the dance at the Heinz House,
Wednesday evening." Meta is an-
other lost to Cleveland, but she
says she envies us all in Pittsburgh:

“The luncheons must be very suc-
cessful and my only regret is that
we didn't have them when I was in
Pittsburgh last year. Surely is an
excellent idea. Give my regards“ to
any of the girls that may inquire
of me. Hope I will, see you real-
soon, if not in Cleveland may be in
Pittsburgh at the -dance or at the

son ‘why we have our dance at
Thanksgiving time, to help entertain
the girls .who come on for the game
and to give them an opportunity to
see _all the old‘ crowd. ‘So here's
hoping we see you there, Meta!

THE "rr1"r TYPE”

 

The announcement that a prize of $100 will be given at the 1922

 commencement exercises to the student regarded as the ideal Pitt

student has resulted in a discussion as to what is the “Pitt type.”
Is it the athlete, the scholar, the debater, the dramatic star or some
other activity leader? This and many other questions will have to

worthy of the prize made possible

‘be settled next year by the group designated to select the student

by George Wharton Pepper.

To us it seems that the all-roundstudent is the one who ‘should
be chosen. He (or it may be she) should excel in more. than one
ﬁeld. ~ The activity leader or athlete not only should stand forward
in ‘his own ﬁeld, but also should rank high scholastically. During

A ' . the intervening months let the school leaders, who probably will se-

lect the ideal student, consider deeply who is the person conforming
to the “Pitt type” or standard which they will establish.

GRAND

 

 

Thanksgiving week is to be a happy
occasion at Pittsburgh’s Million Dol-
lar Grand starting next Monday morn-
ing, November 21, with the presenta-
tion of Charles Ray’s great college
story, “Two Minutes To Go.” .With

. ‘big football games students spending

their holidays at home a generous dis-
play of autumn ﬂowers and many
merry celebrations in honor of the

photoplay of this type is considered
the most appropriate sort- of photo-
play that could be selected. It ex-
haies the very spirit of Thanksgiving
and of youth.

With 'his recent productions Ray
has been presenting the ﬁnest enter-
tainment of his career, endearing him-
self more thoroughly to the hearts of
millions ‘of admirers, and showing
more than ever before that he is an
actor of wonderful artistry. “Scrap
Iron” was an unrivalled hit, and “Two
Minutes To Go” is expected to meet
with even greater public favor. Cer-
tainly Charles has never had armore
absorbing story, nor has he been seen
in a role of greater humor or human
interest appeal.

The story, written by .Richard An-
dres, has its loc-ale in the charming
town harboring Baker University,
where Ray, in the role o-f Chester
Burnett,‘ is an active student. For
three years Chet had led the football
team to many victories. During the
summer vacation preceding his senior
year, however, his father had had
ﬁnancial reverses which meant that
the boy, in order to continue his stud-
ies, was compelled to .go to work. So
secretly he gets a job as milkman,
rising ‘before dawn each day. Deliv-
ering to customers all over the town;
he is unable to take his accuf.
place in the football team. HeIdoesn’t
tell of his work, for fear of embar-
rassing his sweetheart, andthe school
begins to call him quitter, and to look
upon him as one who shirks his
duties. This leads to engrossing de-
velopments, having their climax in a
great football game in which Chet
comes into‘ his own again.

DAVIS

Exacting Broadway, at her recent
Palace Theater debut, has unani-
mously sustained the opinion of the
critics of ‘London and Paris, that di-
minutive Daphne Pollard, the idol of
the ’all»s, who is to head the diversi-
ﬁed all-star Keith vaudeville bill at
the Davis Theater Thanksgiving
Week, beginning next Monday mati-
nee, November 21, is the greatest in-
ternational singing comedienne of her
day. Every city in America has been
clamoring at the Keith booking office
to secure at least one week’s visit
from the little funster before she re-
turns early next spring for engage-
ments abroad of indeﬁnite length, a
fact. which explains the rejoicing evi-
dent around the office of the Harry
Davis Enterprises Company, when
General Manager John P. Harris
brought back from New York re-
cently a contract for her special en-
gagement at the Davis Theater. It
is news which every local 'ttheatergoer
should welcome for Miss Polla:rd’s
autograph duly affixed to this con-
tract, insures one other reason, on

There has been
no individual hit within the year on
Broadway in vaudeville or out of
vaudeville, comparable with that
achieved by Miss Pollard, who‘ is back
in America for the ﬁrst time since

never yet beheld. With her inimitable
drolleries, of -acting, dancing and sing-
ing, and a succession of make-ups
which in their broadest sense are lud-
crous caricatures, this petite singing
comedienne is to the two-a-day what
Ch'ar1ie’CIhaplin is to the ﬁlms.

. '_r_I_—I__I: TURKISH CIGARETTE

' I Every day MURADS are held‘
higher in the estimation of the men.
who smoke them.

They are the standard of Taste.

They never disappoint-—neve1~.
fail——-never change-

They are 100% pure Turkish to-~
bacco-of the ﬁnest varieties grown..

 
 

You are proud to smoke them
in any company--on any occasion.

           
  
  

They are the largest selling high-
grade cigarette in the world.

The cigarette smokers of/Xmerica

DO prefer Quality to Quantity.

the --Bitt’ Culgsfare the 1921 champions. .- A T ‘ , _ _
' “Our Freshmen have defeated decisively West Virginia Freshmen, Cornell
Freshmen, Syracuse Freshmen, Penn State Freshmen‘ and -Kiski. We include
Kiskl as a basisoficomparison. This leaves for consideration the Freshman
teams of Penn, P«rin‘ce-gton, Yale,’ Harvard and D_artmouth.. Dartmouth showed‘
‘her’ strength‘-llastTSatdrdsayi by defeating the .S1tate’.‘Frosh ' by one touchdown,
as compared with our 14-6 victory, but unfortunately we are not familiar with
the -rest of her recordyso that we Wmust.-leave her for. future cpnsideration.
The Harvard Freshmen were tied, by Princeton, while Yale just scored a 6-0.
‘win over the Tigers. . Princeton, ‘however, was severely walloped by Kiski,
35-0. The Penn. Yearlings ‘were defeated, 27-O, by Mercersburg,.a team later‘
‘beaten by the State Freshmen. The_dope,_-then, would point-beyond a shadow
of; a doubt. to the fact that the record of captain Hangar'tner’s Cubs is,
with the possible cxceptilon of-_ the Dartmouth l’-‘reshies, unequalled by that
of. any._other Freshman team in the east. . — T ‘.
No end. ‘of credit for the Freshies’ fine record {can be given to Coach ,.
«Kerr. A Freshmanfootba-ll coach has one of the toughest assignrnen s in
the world. .At the beglWnning-of the season he must take’ a lot of gree ma-
terial, coached under a great variety of systems, with no*‘nucleus whatever
to work upon, and ‘mould it into‘.a machine, within a few weeks. This Mr.
Kerr has always "-been able to do with the result that year after year he
turns out winning elevens. :His successes rank/him as one of the really
great football mentors of the country. V '_ is . W . - 1 , ’ '
The team itself has shown a wonderful spirit and has proved its ability.
lIQ'WfCaptai'n Hangartncr it had ‘a leader and a player par excellent. Hank won
his way into 'the hearts of his menfand enjo.yed,their utmost, confidence. in
Bohren. it had ‘a field ~gene‘ral who sriouldi rank as one of the greatest. we
‘ever had. in addition ‘Bohren projxced himselfsa player without weakness on
both offense and-‘defense. Ashbaugh’s work at center. was consistent and
good. Coach Kerr had three big" guards in Hangartner, Lewis and Carnahan.
.Akins and. Murdock‘- made ‘-3 powerful pair of tackles, while Gwosden and
Frank Wplayed some’ “great’football-W at the ends. “Hoots".Flanagan proved a
mighty valuable man_ at the quarter-back position, while Bmder was a worthy
side’-kick‘ for Bohren.‘ Johnson at fullback has -played some great football.
All‘theW subs have shown to good advanWtage.,when called upon. . A few of
ithe"m are deserving of special mention, Noon at tackle, Harvey at end, an_d_
Bruckman and Evans in t‘he'backfiel_cl. Bruckman and Evans have done
especia'lly’ well and the team. has--never been weakened by their appearance
in the game. Both have fully‘ as great possibilities as any other member of
the.‘ squad. ~ W ~ W , s _ - ~ W i  ' .- , ‘
The teamyafter‘ a year under Coach Kerr, should "give Warner some
great material next year to work intothe presentmachine. The Freshies

again] last -Saturday at the hands of
Wash.-Jeff.‘ After six consecutive‘
years of victory over its trad-itional
foe it, remained for “Greasy” Neale
in his ﬁrst year at W. and J. 't.o
turn out a team that. made the
Panther bow to defeat. A forward
pass, -Brenke-“rt to Kop-f, produced
the” one and only score. '

From theiirst whistle to the last
it was a. bitter battle and-ong tliaff
will‘ reniain long in the minds of
those who saw it. Before game
time it was an acknowledged faci
that a break would decide the game
otherwise’. it would result in pa
scoreless tic. Both teams battled
on eventerms until, the break in
the ﬁnal quarter. ‘

ple saw Russ Stein win the toss and
Tc.mmy Davies kickoff to Erickson.
From then on until the end of the
half it was _a -‘punting duel between
the -two teams. On the very first
play of the ggme Brenkert p-untied
to Davies, wh-o'”was downed without
gaining. Pitt was unable to make a
