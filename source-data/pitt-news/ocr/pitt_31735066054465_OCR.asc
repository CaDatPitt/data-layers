PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — There
was more evidence yesterday of an
impending security crackdown in the
capital of Cambodia. Col. Kov Samoth,
brother—in—law of the most powerful
politician in Cambodia, Second Premier
Hun Sen, was gunned down as he left a
restaurant yesterday. After shooting him
four times, the suspect "hopped on a
motorcycle with another man and
escaped.

After the murder, Hun Sen said in a

radio address,"“I cannot say that it is a
political murder, but it is a real threat. I

am sincere in my desire for peace, but if
the need arises, I can order ﬁghting with-

Marriott’: possible contract
renewal draws complaints

One “block” on your meal plan will
buy two Pizza Hut pizzas and a soda at

I Schenley Cafe, but try to buy a hearty salad

for the same low price and you’re out of
luck.
_ Health—conscious students are not the
only eaters expressing their dissatisfaction
with Pitt’s meal plan. Many residents
required to buy a meal plan of at least $770
a semester said they feel like they’re being
ripped off.

“When it comes to quality, we’re not

. getting what we pay for,” said Nick

Lierman, an ofﬁcer of the Resident Student
Association. Other members of RSA
said they feel that with a variety of loca-
tions like Eddie’s and Schenley Cafe there
should be a better selection of quality food.

Pitt’s contract with Mam'ott’s catering

service ends this August, and the caterer ‘

may be replaced by another company. As
Marriott’s contract reaches its fmal months,

students say that this is the time to speak.
.out. i

“Where in the world can you buy a
decent meal for only $4.50?” asked Lori
Brownrniller, a senior living on campus.

Students complain they aren’t satisﬁed
by the amount of food $4.50 gets them in
the food courts.

“We do not advise that a student spend
$4.50 on a cup of soup —— we offer students
a meal plan, not a _food plan,” said Betsy
Sallade-Farina, director of Food Services.

Other students feel that one block isn’t
enough. After buying a large sub from
Hometown Hero, there isn’t money left for
a drink.

Sallade-Farina said Choice Dollars are
offered to supplement the meal plan, and
can be used by students who exceed the
allotted $4.50. In addition, she and other
members of the Food Services department
are constantly reviewing prices to stay
competitive with other universities.

When a student comes to the depart-

ment and complains that a certain price is
too high, it is reviewed and, in some cases,
adjusted.

Patrick Wagner, chair of the Student
Government Board Food Service
Committee said Food Services shou1dn’t
plan so far in advance. He said this type of
planning may be the reason for high prices.

But he also pointed out other factors.

“Students can complain until they are
blue in the face, but there are certain things
that Food Services carmot do,’_’ said

Wagner. “I understand that the prices are

high, but I also understand the constraints
under which the department works.”

Last year, Wagner’s committee con-
ducted a campus—wide survey asking stu-
dents to rate certain aspects of the meal
plan offered by Marriott. The focus of the

survey’ was quality. Students rated food
' quality between two and three on a scale of

ﬁve. A

In relation to nearby universities, Pitt
falls within $300 of both the highest and
lowest priced schools.‘ At Duquesne
Univeristy, 14 meals a week throughout the
semester costs $1,226. Slippery Rock
University only charges $790 per semester
for 14 meals a week, but they offer only
two dining halls to students.

Pitt’s 14 meals per week plan is $975
per semester, and Food, Services said they
feel as though the diversity of food offered
puts them above competitors.

In addition to students’ concern over
the price of the meal plans, is their concern
that money not spent is money lost forever.

Sometimes, only 12 of 14 meals are
used in one given week. That’s $9 lost. In
addition, students with other types of meal
plans, can horde their blocks until the end
of the semester. The blocks will be lost if
they aren’t used, causing a spending frenzy
at the end of each semester.

Sallade-Farina said Food Services is
negotiating ideas about a dollar—for—dollar
concept, where students will pay only for
what they buy, this may or may not equal
the notorious $4.50 block.

don’t get enough.

“It comes down to need, and we try to be
consistent [in dispersing funds],” Campagna
said ‘

But the groups even said they disagree
about the fairness of the fund distribution.
Some groups are able to obtain a vastly larg-
er budget, while others are left with little or
nothing. ,

Matt White, captain of the Pitt hockey
club, said the money his organization
receives is very inconsistent from year to
year.

“I can’t ﬁgure it out, we ask for the same
things every year, but the amount we get is
always changing,” said White. “You really
have to try and budget enough at the begin-
ning or forget it; you won’t get anything.”

According to White, the hockey club’s
practice funding went down drastically in the
1995-1996 academic year, a year after they
claimed their league’s championship. But this

” year, their funds went back up.

“Look at how lousy our football team is
and how much money they have to waste 
Pitt won’t even give us the transportation to
get to our games,” said White. “Getting
money from allocations is tedious and iffy. If
your team isn’t as popular or trendy as others,
you just don’t get [the money].”

Campagna said the reason for this is that
every practice the hockey team holds is a
competition.

return. Of those 842 dropouts, 26 percent
were freshmen, 30 percent sophomores, 17
percent juniors, and 26 percent seniors.

According to David Brumble, the asso-
ciate dean for undergraduate studies, Pitt’s
dropout rate is lower than the national aver-
age. ,

In last year’s freshman class, 15.3 per-
cent dropped out. The national figure is 26
percent. Pitt’s rate is lower than both public
and private averages by 22 and 28 percent,
respectively. ,

Upon hearing of the shortfall, depart-
ment heads sent lists of classes that could
have been cut to Brumble. Most of these
classes were taught by part-time instructors.
According to Brumble, the English and

math departments would probably have_

been hit the hardest because they employ
the largest number of part-timers. _

According to David Bartholomae in
the English department, at one point it
looked as though as many as six classes
would have to be taken off the books.
Bartholomae said that, though things
looked goodnow, if problems arose, posi-
tions in the writing center would  the first
to go.

Though classes will not be cut, funding
is so tight that other programs are in danger,
even in departments that have few part-time
faculty members. 9 ’

“We didn’t get all the funding expect-
ed, but we were able to pull through,” said
Norm Hurnmon in sociology.

“If hockey goes to a game, no matter
how you slice it, they are competing,” said
Campagna. “When golf goes to play, they
just play. It’s not limited in the same way as
[hockey] .” ,

The hockey team contends that they are
just trying to provide people with an opportu-
nity to play the sport, but by its very nature
requires another team to play against, even in
practice.

The Allocations Committee still calls

this “competition” and funding is lost.

The crew ‘team is another group that
claims they don’t get enough money to prac-
tice.

According to members, the Pitt crew
team has a large membership and high
expenses and has only been given $2,182.

In comparison, the Pitt golf club
received a $6,417 budget for practices from
allocations 4 this year, and the Campus
Billiards club received $3,830. Each club has
a much lower enrollment than crew.

“It’s really ridiculous because our
expenses are phenorne ,” said Meredith
Martin, the women’s varsity crew captain

Martin said the men’s and women’s
crewteambothrequire several $12,000boats
and $500 sets of cars to practice with, the
entire cost of which they must cover them-
selves because their allocated funding is not

Hurnrnon said the push to recruit for a
new position in the department is virtually
hopeless now and that sociology may lose a
person whose primary responsibility was
“meeting student needs” because of cut-
backs.

According to Brumble, faculty wage
raises will not be affected by the shortfall.
The 3.5 percent raises, approved by the
Board of Trustees in June, amount to $1.1
million.

Brumble said in an earlier interview
that CAS is conducting a review of the

going to take a lot of agonizing and discus-
sion,” Brumble said. “When you’re in

AmeriCorps offers experience and opportunity for volunteers

Many students want to build a
resume with community service,
but it’s difficult to do that, go to
school, and earn money at the same
time’. A program named AmeriCorps
is now helping people across the
country do all three.

AmeriCorps, a two—year old
program, dubs itself the domestic
Peace Corps because of its involve-

ment in such activities as immuniz-

ing children, building low-cost

AmeriCorps’ Public Affairs
spokesperson, said the program not
only helps students gain experience,
but also helps provide funding for
their education later in life.

“AmeriCorps is like the GI Bill
that was around in the ‘40s and
‘50s,” he said. “It’s a program for
students so that they can help the
community and earn money for
school simultaneously. Almost all
of the 25,000 AmeriCorps members
are students.”

More than 25,000 people
nationwide work for AmeriCorps.

education. They also receive hous-
ing and a $650 per month living
allowance. The stipend is funded
with federal money and corporate
sponsors such as Microsoft, Fila,
and Westinghouse.

But not every AmeriCorps vol-
unteer is a student working towards

-their education. Frank Salati, 18, a

recent graduate of St Joseph’s High
School in Natrona Heights, Pa.,
doesn’t plan on attending college
after his year with AmeriCorps.

“Most of the students just grad-
uated from high school, some are
taking a year off from college, and a
couple are done with college,”
Salati said. “The age range for
workers is between 18 and 24, so
most people are pretty young.”

Salati lived most ofhis life in
the Pittsburgh area, and said he
thought AmeriCorps would give
him the opportunity to work with
his peers and see more of the coun-
try while making a difference in
other people’s lives. g

“I am participating just for the
experience because it is such a
tremendous one. I also like working
with lots of kids my own age at the
center,” he said.

Salati works in Seattle, on a 12-
person team at a crime prevention
center. His team (most of the teams
are made up of 12 or 13 members)
is creating a Center for Youth Crime
Protection, to help deter crimes
committed by and against youths.

“Over 50 percent of the mem-
bers do environmental work, some
others do public safety work, and
others work towards unmet human
needs,” he said.

Some of the AmeriCorps work-
ers serve in two national programs -

SEAC says permanent Bigelow closing is lost cause

 
 

Q

The Student Environmental Action
Coalition has crossed the Bigelow issue off
its list of things to do.

At a recent meeting, SEAC members
made a list of potential issues to focus on
for the rest of the year, and Bigelow was
eliminated as a contender.

‘”There’s not much more to do,” said
member Jed Meltzer.

“We did what SEAC’s good at — and
that’s getting people’s attention to an issue,”
added Mike Kaizar.

It was SEAC, primarily under the orga-
nization of Meltzer, who put together the

 

Fee

The costs dilferences for these expenses
must be paid for by ﬁmdraising, alumni sup-
port, and team dues. Often the groups can’t
raise the money they need.

The crew team is used as a marketing
aspect on Pitt videos, and is also highly dec-
orated from championship victories, but
Martin said they are stonewalled by both Pitt
and the Allocations Committee when it
comes to funding.

But Pitt defines that group’s activities as
“competition.” According the Allocations
Manual, SGB must consider any group
which separates teams a “competitive sport,”
and deny them money.

“It’s really all in what you want to call
competition, I don’t see how going out to
practice golf is any dilferent than going out to
practice [rowing],” said Martin.

The uncompetitive sports also receive a
great deal more funding than other sports. In
comparison to the hockey team’s $6,300, the
Pitt Ski and Snowboard Club has an
approved $7,954 budget.

Campagna said she syrnpathized with
teams that don’t get as much money, but said
uncompetitive sports fall under a different
category.

“These organizations are largely differ-
ent in their purpose and what they request,”
said Campagna “If we could, we’d give
teams everything they need.”

rally on the Cathedral lawn, the night
Bigelow was re-opened after the 30-day
trial closing.

“I think it’s going to close,” Meltzer
said Sunday. “That’s just the buzz I got
from the TV reporters that were at the
rally.”

SEAC members have not received any
official word about the fate of the street. But
with Bigelow aside, the group had a little
trouble deciding on exactly which cause to
devote the majority of its energy.

Several members expressed concern
about waste incinerators in Chester, a city in
Delaware County. Five incinerators were
placed in this primarily minority communi-
ty as the result of a county decision.

“They’re all probably within a mile of
each other,” said Meltzer.

Several members of the group said
they believe the decision was racially-moti-
vated because complaints about the inciner-
ators may be less likely in a neighborhood
of minorities. The incinerators are also
environmentally dangerous.

“The EPA [Environmental Protection
Agency] doesn’t measure emissions on an
overall basis,” explained Kaizar.
“Individually, the incinerators are safe, but
all ﬁve together is way over the limit.”

Other members said the group should
devote itself to ﬁghting to close down a dif-
ferent incinerator —— that of Waste
Technologies Industries, located in East

Still others thought SEAC should
focus on things closer to Pittsburgh, such as
the destruction of the Allegheny National
Forest and recycling on campus.

What the group ﬁnally did agree on
was the issue of a conference. Members
voted eight to one to host a regional SEAC
conference in the spring and agreed to
begin planning it immediately.

Elly Glenn, a member, said she worries
that if SEAC doesn’t plan the conference
no one else will, and the regional confer-
ence won’t happen at all.

‘The conference would be the coolest
way to incorporate all of these other ideas,”
said Nicole Shoener, another member.

Election is low priority for many

Hours are long, pay is low,
but members still enjoy SGB

Anne Estonilo
 

 

Being elected to Student Government
Board provides access to a lot of power, but
money can’t be the motivation.

SGB members get a stipend of about
$85 a month, according to Joyce
Giangarlo, the associate director of Student
Activities. I

She said the stipend was to try to make
up for the money students could be making
with a part-time job. Because students
often spend so many hours chairing orga-
nizations and an extra job isn’t always pos-
sible, the stipend gives them something
tangible for their work.

“This is not about money,’ said
Lauren Leiter, a board member. She said
she spent many extra hours working in
addition to the 10 mandatory hours board
members must put in each week. Big pro-
jects often oonsumed even more time and
energy.

Remunerations or stipends for gover-
nance group leaders are atleast 19 years
old, according to Giangarlo. The program
was set up as a way to evaluate student
work on campus organizations. I

A She said that in 1994, remunerations at
Pitt were compared to those at» other uni-

9

"7

Versities. What she found was a major dif-
ference in Pitt’s stipends compared to other
places.

“We were so far behind what [other
universities] were salarying,” she said.

The result of the study was an addition
of a one-year’s paid tuition for the SGB
president to the stipend. The president gets
a monthly stipend of $100, but according
to board member Marc Friedberg, it’s not
much.

“[SGB President Andy Wuertele]
spends a hell of a lot more time up here,”
Friedberg said.

Most of the board members agreed
money wasn’t the issue. Brian Riemer, an
allocations committee. member, said he
currently gets paid about $66 a month. As
a newly—e1ected SGB member, he said $20
more to his stipend won’t make a big dif-
ference considering the amount of work
that lies ahead of him

“Some people say it looks good on
your resume,” said Riemer. “It’s too much
work for one lousy line on the resume.
You’ve got to enjoy it in some way.”

Cyrus Zolghadri, another board mem-
ber, said he liked interacting with so many
different types of people. He said he got a
chance to form relationships’ with people

he normally wouldn’t get to know.

If you didn’t know the Student
Go"emment Board elections were yester-
day, don’t feel bad — you weren’t alone.

While many undergraduates on Pitt’s
campus took the time to Vote, others said
simply that they didn’t ﬁnd it necessary.

“I don’t plan to Vote because I didn’t
even know what the SGB stood for. The
candidates walk around today passing out
ﬂiers but they should have made them-
selves known before now,” said freshman
Andrew Robertson.

. Many freshmen on campus felt left out
or not too well—ir1fonned about the candi-
dates or issues, to want to participate.

“Freshmen have no clue to what is
going on,” Bethany Bradey, a freshman,
said.

As other students stood in line to cast
their vote, questions about the candidates
were being asked: “Who is the person that
talks about students ﬁrst?” and “Who is that
guy I like?”

“I don’t know who I am going to vote
for yet, but Bigelow is a big issue for me. I
really like the feeling when they closed the
street because Pitt felt more like a campus,”
said junior Alan Shih, as he stood in line to
vote.

After some students cast their Vote,
they couldn’t remember who they voted

Thursday, November 21, 1996

for. They voted only because they knew it
was their right as. students.

“I really don’t remember who I voted
for but I hope they will work hard at
improving the food service at Pitt,” com-
mented sophomore Kevin Keefer.

As SGB candidate, Mitch Schacher,
stood outside of the Towers passing out
ﬂiers to students, he was determined to get
students to vote.

“I am Very excited, we have done a lot A

and worked hard, but the major issue is if
people will vote or not,” Schacher said.

There was a small percentage of stu-
dents that voted who actually knew why
they were Voting for each candidate.

“I voted for Marquette Bowman
because I feel as though he could represent
me. As an out-of-state engineering student
with a three-year and $60,000 investment, I
feel as though the administration has turned
a deaf ear to the black students on campus,”
said Jason Bertram, a junior.

There were also students who didn’t
have time to vote, didn’t want to vote, or
just found the entire idea of voting ridicu-
lous.

,“I am not going to vote because" the
entire thing is a joke. The candidates that
run have money, fraternities, or sororities
backing them up. They are not interested in
the issues or helping student life, but just
padding their resumes,” said senior Joel
Letter.

The ’’political junkies’ high” strikes SGB president-elect Justin DalMolin (L) and members-elect Christa Douaihy, Marquette Bowman, and Jen Molluso.

Election

Andrew Wuertele kept the atmos-
phere tense by wordlessly coming
into the boardroom and writing the
results on a marker board.

Victoria Hall was the first
polling place to be posted, but the
nai1—biting didn’t begin_ until the
returns from Benedum Hall hit the
tally board. I

Friedberg pulled
ahead slightly.

DalMolin paced
the SGB lobby ner-
vously. p

“Does anybody
else want to
scream?” board can-
didate David
Eisenberg said as the
returns were slowly
posted.

But the William
Pitt Union tallies took the tension
to new heights for the presidential
candidates when they each received
171 votes.

DalMolin won the election with
the returns from the Towers’ polling
area, and the candidates fidgeted
for almost 20 minutes until current
board "President Andy Wuertele
posted the final election results.

Both presidential candidates
were taken out of the general

results were apparent when the can-
didates came out of the room.

DalMolin broke into tears of
elation while Friedberg walked qui-
etly out of the SGB office.

_ President—elect
DalMolin said he
couldn’t believe the
election came down
to just three votes.

“I knew it would
be close, but I didn’t
know it would be
that close,”
DalMolin said.

Board member-
elect Christa
Douaihy also thought
the experience was
tense, and the race too close to call
until the very end. .

‘.‘This was more overwhelming
than I could ever imagine,”
Douaihy said. '

Overall, the number of students
that turned out to vote was about
the same as last year, 1863 this year
compared with 1882 last year.

But this year, students were
supposed to have both a Pitt ID and
a Student Activities Card to vote. A

with the turnout of the elections,

The Pitt News gives a little
advice to the SGB-elect

SGB elections took place yesterday. We would like to give our
new members-elect a big congratulations and a little advice on what
SGB should do.

First of all, we found the “town-hall meeting,” which was spon-
sored by Marquette Bowman Monday night, to be a really great
idea. Our new SGB should plan to hold more forums in which
administrators, student groups, and the general student population
can come together. This is a medium in which the administration and
students can communicate with one another and get to question each
other about what each side needs and what can be provided. We
would like to congratulate Marquette on his organization of this
event. We hope that this was the ﬁrst of many such “town-hall meet-
ings” to come. ‘

The new SGB should also make an agenda which would be
available to students. A statement of the board’s plans for the com-
ing year would be a helpful bridge of communication between SGB
and the students it represents. Throughout their campaigns, many of
the candidates spoke of how they saw the biggest problem on cam-
pus to be communication. The ﬁrst place to start ﬁxing this problem
is with the board itself. Let the student body know what the newly-
formed board as a whole plans to do. We’ ve heard what the individ-
ual candidates and slates want to accomplish. Now, tell us what will

come of those separate ideologies and goals that are being brought I

-together.

SGB as the elected representative of the student body at Pitt
should push to get a seat on the Board of Trustees. The students at
this University need a voice on the Board of Trustees, and we’ve
elected you to be our spokesmen when dealing with the administra-

V tion. It is‘only right that the highest echelon of leadership within the

University has a student voice. Now, we must demand it.
We feel that the suggestions above as well as other goals such
as getting the union to stay open later to provide an alternative to the
bar scene for student recreation and getting both Eddie’s and

V Schenley to stay open until 11 p.m. every night are areas in which

SGB can really make a difference. We wish the new SGB—elects the
best of luck and look forward to seeing what you can accomplish:

When we attack
another race, we are
attacking ourselves

In The Pitt News published
on Nov. 18, there was a letter
decrying a certain headline that
appeared in a previous issue,
next to which was an apology, of
sorts, for the same. The feelings
of the person who wrote the ‘let-
ter are somewhat understand-

— able, but the letter failed to take

into account the fact that the
headline was aimed not at the
Italian community, but at the
review writers and reviewed
artists, respectively. ‘

As the apology stated,
“satire is a dead art form.” Not

exactly. It might be better said ’

that humor is a dead art form.
Real humor, that is. I refuse to
elaborate further, but I certainly
understood from the headline (as
some others obviously did not)
that the review writers were
losers, of a sort, to try to critique
something from a culture of
which they probably understood
very little. Likewise for the rap-
pers; Mr. Dogg and Mr. Shakur
were attempting to use personal-
ities from another culture, result-
ing, at the very least, in n1isinter—
pretation. The headline was writ-
ten tongue-in-cheek, and that
should have been obvious. It
may also have been in poor
taste,which might explain my

previous statement about real

humor. But in any case, why feel
insulted? Racial insults are actu-
ally only self-degrading. If
someone attacks another race,

they are attacking themselves,
because, as the letter writer so
rightly puts it, we are all mem-
bers of the human race.

And that is something of
which I, for one, find little rea-
son to be proud. Figure that one
out yourself.

“A certain prince of the pre-
sent time, whom it is not well to
name, never does anything but
preach peace and good faith, but
his is really a great enemy to
both and either of them, had he
observed them, would have lost
him state or reputation on many
occasions.” _
-—Niccolo Machiavelli

No one should want
to have a nation of
discrimination

This is in response to Matt
Mills’ article “Use your common
sense: Vote Bob Dole for
President.” While most of the
article consisted of the usual
Republican rhetoric, he is just
begging to be reprimanded when
he mentioned the social issues of
the upcoming election. These

issues included same-sex mar-M

. am .2111

riages and gays in the military.

While it seems Mr. Mills is
an extremely patriotic person
and is very proud to be part of
“the greatest nation in history,”
what is so great about discrimi-
nation?!

This nationis a very racist,
sexist, and homophobic nation
that supposedly does not tolerate
discrimination. The issue of
same-sex marriages should be a
moot point as far as the laissez-
faire politics of the Republican
Party. Where does the govern-
ment or society get off telling
people who they can and cannot
marry? Stroll back 30 years ago
and the government told us that
it was illegal for blacks and
whites to marry —— isn’t the
same-sex marriage issue yet
another civil rights battle?

THE PITT NEWS

Hey "O": quit whining and get on the ball

I’m not writing as an angry student
who is once again upset with the sys-

tem. I am, however, writing with con-

cerns of the so-called “easier” pathways
our system has set up for us. As we all
know, the idea of the PittCard is to make
things accessible to students without

, jeopardizing the safety of its user. In

order to make this work throughout the
community of -Oakland, it was under-
stood that the community itself would
have to embrace such accessibility with
its own good intents. For years now, the
Original Hot Dog Shop has made it
known to the community of Oakland
that the University has held unfair sanc-
tions against its establishment. They’ve
issued petitions, joined in protest with
other merchants, and even were so bold
as to publicize it in The Pitt News. Now
that CampusFunds have been promoted
as the thing of the future and all are
jumping on board, the “O” smiled
eagerly at this wonderful opportunity to
feel more like a part of the University
community. However, they failed to
implement the necessary factors to help

‘ this become a smooth transition. I know

the PittCard has had its share of prob-
lems, but knowing and being aware of
this problem helps to make it possibly

better for others. Two weeks ago, when
the “O” started accepting
CampusFunds, I was overjoyed, yet
when I when I went to pay for my pur-
chase with my ID, no one in the build-
ing knew how to work the card machine
but the manager. Wouldn’t it seem ideal
to have all of your employees or at least
several key employees know how to
work the machine? I had to wait 20 min-
utes for the manager to finally work my
card through‘ and then tell me it had
insufficient funds! How could that be? I

had just added $100.00 to the card. The .

manager proceeded to question my sta-
tus as a student and I in turn asked if she
knew how to correctly run the machine.
In response, she said they had been
doing it for two weeks, yet it had actual-
ly only been three days.‘ Every other
place takes my card, no problem.

Again,.I am aware that when new
things get started through several differ-
ent systems that it takes a while to work
out all the bugs. Yet it would seem ﬁt-
ting for the “O” to stop its whining, get
with the program, and do it right!

Ethnic slur headline was a disgrace

The article written last Thursday enti-
tled “White boys look at black boys who
pose as daegos” and the so-called apology
written on Monday entitled ‘Perhaps it

' should have read, ‘Gangstas tryin’ to be
Gangsters”’ in response to Thursday can-
not be left as it stands...

Some people may ask, “What is the
big deal?” In response to those ‘people,
...the word “daego” is calling Italians “the
scum of the Earth.” It is one of the most
offensive put—downs a person can call an
Italian. Its negative connotation should
have been known by the author as well as
the editing staff. This word, along with any
other such term, would not be used by any-
one with any type of journalistic integrity.

To add to the ﬁre, the author continues
his ignorance by directly linking Italians to
the mob and gangsters. This is just perpet-
uating a stereotype that has been around for
far too long... This is ignorant, urmecessary,
and unacceptable.

To cover up for this ﬁasco, the author
writes what we guess he thinks is an apol-
ogy. This attempt failed miserably because
it seemed very insincere. This is because of

 his word choice as he

lgot a haircut, now I'll get a real job

_ I’m writing in response to p.r. tay-
lor’s editorial entitled, “Get a Haircut and
Get a Real Job.” Negativity, negativity,
and more negativity. Hey man, have you
learned anything in the four years of your
education besides the rules guiding you
on how to be accepted into the “system?”
Graduating from this ﬁne institution does
not have to ‘beviewed as a time to start
writing a resume and searching for a job
in the want ads. What about sitting down,
taking a really good look at yourself, and
deciding what has become of you after
four long years of education? Only you
choose what to make of your future. If
you don’t want to get up in the early
hours of the day and battle traffic to get to
that average job that any other willy—nilly
can perform, you don’t have to. And if
you are going into it with such a negative
attitude, then it’s going to be a shitty
experience and you’re going to be
depressed. If you are truly envious of
freshmen who are just‘ starting college,

maybe you need more education your-

self. Graduating college is deﬁnitely a

- “new. birth” in life. But it DOESN’T

HAVE TO be a birth into an ugly, cruel
world filled with unhappiness, hum-drurn
jobs, and boring unimaginative lives. It is
a new birth that contains many possibili-
ties. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
Advice from Tom Petty: “Runaway, let
your heart be your guide.” In the past four
years, you’ve sought out and acquired the
education you were highly encouraged to
receive if you wished to have any chance
of success in this world. Why not move

‘one that you can’t receive in college: life

states in the second para-
graph, “So, I guess I owe
some people an apology.”

You guess? Does the author not realize that
what he wrote was wrong? Never once
was it written in the second article that he
knows he was wrong. He did not directly
apologize to the Italian culture and people
for writing such harmful words.

The sad part of this whole situation is
that this author represents a lot of people
who are ignorant to the fact that such words
can undo the work that has been done and
continues to be done today. Work to stop
prejudice and discrimination... has done
great things to promote equality. This
University... prides itself on its diversity
and these articles have put a thorn into the
progress that this campus has made.

Therefore, we, as the diverse commu-
nity... who are proud to be a part of Pitt
need to take a stand, now, before this type
of ignorance goes any further. If we do not,
there is no telling how far this paper will
go. This type of “journalism” has no place
on this campus, and deﬁnitely not in a pub-
lic campus-wide newspaper such as The

‘Pitt News. It bears the name of this

University and should represent the intelli-
gence and integrity of its community.

not the only choice. Nor is it the role of

 I would like to com-
mend The Pitt News for their extensive
coverage of the ‘96 election. However, I
must reply to the editorial written by
Kris Kissel. As Governmental Relations
Chairwoman for Student Government,
my committee has worked incredibly
hard to register 3,500 students to vote
and also on distributing over 700 educa-
tional packets on election day. I feel very
strongly that voting is your right and
‘even if one may not read ﬁve newspa-
pers per day or be a political science
major, you should still do so. Mr. Kissel
says that if you are not completely up-
to-date on every single issue, you should
not vote. I believethat this is very dis-
couraging to many students and if one
person is really passionate about a cer-
tain issue, he or she has every right to
vote. This also disproves his idea that if
one has not been studying the candidates
for months, he or she is not worthy to
vote.

As the organizer behind bringing
the MTV Choose, or Lose bus to

A Bigelow Boulevard, I think that it is

ridiculous to say that one should not
vote if he hadn’t been registered before
this event. The aim of the bus is simple:
I wanted to get people excited to vote
and I believe that the bus positively
‘added to the registration campaign on
the Pitt campus. As we all know, politics
are very hard to get people interested in,
but have a huge impact on people’s
lives. Despite this involvement in peo-
ple’s lives, many students refuse to vote.

Use your choice, voting is our voice

I am tired of people complaining about
how they do not have a voice or justify-
ing abstinence from voting because the
government is corrupt. Voting is our
voice!

I may preach about how important
voting is because it is our voice, but it
also provides us with the opportunity to
hold our politicians accountable for their
campaign promises. This is where our
duty as citizens to complain comes in
and also, for groups such as mine, to rep-

resent the views of students on the local,

state, and federal levels of government.
One thing on which I do agree with
the writer is his view that students must
be educated. I do not agree with unedu-
cated voting and more people should
become-invested in politics or else our
legislators will take away the freedom
that we deserve. If the same people con-
tinue to vote, nothing in America will
change, no matter how much we com-
plain. We must reach out to every stu-
dent, every class, every ethnic back-

ground! Only then-will we have a truly

educated campus and country, and this,
in turn, should motivate people not only
to vote, but to learn about who they are
voting for.

So, if you registered with Choose or

Lose or any person registering people on
campus this year, don’t be ashamed. Be
proud that you are taking part in shaping
our future, but shape it wisely.

thought things
couldn ’t get
any weirder

    

 

 

I am a very strange guy. Many people
can attest to that. I do weird things for weird
reasons simply because I- think it’s pretty
funny. Yes, in some states I am a prime can-
didate for state and federal funding; in fact,
people like me have rehabilitation centers
and institutes named after them.

Not here, though. As I walk around
campus I get bombarded with SGB propa-
ganda bearing catchy slogans like
“Strengthening our Foundation” and
“Students First.” I applaud these candidates
for their time and effort, but I really question
their true purpose.

Do they really want to get in there and
change what’s going on here at Pitt or are
they looking for a great resume builder and
the $80 monthly stipend that comes with
the territory? I guess all of this gibberish is
besides the point. Unfortunately, there is
nothing I can write or say that will change
the way our campus runs. That’s why I get
my picture here week in and week out. I live
to talk about things that really don’t matter
when it comes right down to it: sports.

What a life.

Day in and day out I rack my brain to
come up with clever ideas about grown
men running around and beating on each
other. Maybe that sounds sadistic, but to me
it’s heaven.

With the end of the semester near, I
have decided to do a quick little review of
some of the sports quirks that caught my
attention this week. Pay attention — you
will be tested.

Big East Tourney set for Field Hose

Pitt hopes to recapture title as
conference's second seed

Fans screaming.

Music blaring.

Athletes battling towards
the ultimate goal — a champi-
onship.

And we’re not talking Pitt
Basketball.
The University of

Pittsburgh is making ﬁnal
preparations for this weekend’s
annual Big East Volleyball
Tournament at the Fitzgerald
Field House.

Top seeds Notre Dame
(19-9, 11-0) and Pitt (21-10, 9-
2) each have ﬁrst-round byes
for ﬁnishing first and second.

. respectively, in the Big East

regular season. The Fighting
Irish defeated the Panthers in
four sets in last year’s champi-
onship. The South Bend squad
already swept Pitt at the Field
House in their only meeting of
the 1996 campaign.

“Our loss [to Notre Dame]
was mental,” said Pitt Head
Coach Cindy Alvear. “If we
pick up our game it wouldn’t
surprise me if we win this tour-
nament.”

The path to Panther glory
in this weekend’s ﬁnal is not a
given. Pitt will meet the winner
of the preliminary match
between 3rd-seed Villanova

 

and 6th-seed St. John’s. The
Wildcats, a heavy ﬁrst-round
favorite, defeated Pitt in
straight sets last weekend.

Alvear believes the edge
in a Pitt-Villanova semiﬁnal
matchup would fall on the
Panther’s side.

“I think the best—case sce-
nario would be to play
Villanova,” Alvear said. “We
are very vengeful after
Saturday’s loss and it could
give us a real emotional edge.
The girls aren’t going to let
them come into our house and
beat us.”

Pitt will look to regain the
Big East title with Jennie
Driscoll and Stephanie
Dufresne leading the way.
Driscoll ﬁnished the season
with a team—high 372 kills and
48 blocks. Dufresne ﬁnished
the ‘96 campaign near the top
of the conference with 1,322
assists. Both led the Panthers
with a .336 attack percentage.

Another key to the week-
end could be Panther hitter
Jessica Van Der Mallie.

“I think we’re going to
expect a lot from Jess,” said
Alvear. “She’s taking her play
to a new level. The last three
games she played against
Georgetown [last weekend]
were the best of her career.”

Van Der Mallie ﬁnished

Snior sr Stephanie Dufresne IS among the

 

conference leaders in assists.

the last match of the regular
season Sunday against the
Hoyas with a team—high 17
kills and 17 digs.

“We’ve practiced hard this
wee ,” said Alvear, “and
we’ve sharpened up on block-
ing and play sets that will help
us better defend against the
opposition.”

Terry talks abo

Hey, if the Spectrum can cover sports,
why cant sports cover music? Granted,
gospel music may not tickle the fancy of
many ‘college students, but Pittsburgh
natives should be excited to know that The
Pitt News became the first city publication
to interview Terry Bradshaw in quite some
time. You know, that guy in the Hall of
Fame whofs won four Super Bowls and
etched his face in the memories of anybody

who follows sports.

Anyway, Mike Kovak (sports editor
and Steelers supporter) and Ned Schano
(staﬁ writer and Steelers supporter) were
the privileged journalists who got to talk to
Terry. Unfortunately, he didn’t want to talk
much sports, he wanted to talk about his
gospel collaboration with Jake Hess. The

album is titled Terry & Jake.

TPN: So what do you think about this

Pittsburgh weather?

work with your childhood hero?

TB: I wish there were really more words
that could describe what this means to me.
But Jake is such a nice person. I didn’t real-
ly know what he’d be like until I called him
on the phone. To do an album with some-
one you don’t qualify being around, it’s
pretty intimidating. I had to sit there and
watch this 70-year-old guy sing and to hear
him sing at 70-years of age, whew, and to
know that I used to stand there with an old
Motorola and now I’m sitting here in the

studio across from him. It’s pretty over-

whelming. I tried to be cool about it, you
know? (laughs) I didn’t want him to think
he was bigger than he really was. (More

Myron Cope gives Vince the lowdown on Rivalry Weekend

Is your favorite team having a bad year?
Are you down because your squad gave up
three punt returns for touchdowns on nation-
al television? If so, then cheer up my friend,
because Rivalry Weekend is upon us.

For Ohio State fans, disdain for
Michigan is so intense that the following
question would have to be pondered long
and hard before an answe‘ I was given: would
you rather go 10-1, with the loss coming to
Michigan, or 1-10, with the win coming
against the Wolverines‘? " .

As for the once-tremendous Pitt—Pe
State series, there are two theories on its
demise —— the Lion Theory and the Panther
Theory The Lion Theory says that Pitt
ruined }’atemo’s longtime dream for an east-
ern all-sports conference in the early 1980s
by joining the Big East for basketball,
because having Pitt in the fold was neces-
sary in order for Patemo to entice Boston
College and Syracuse to bolt the Big East
and join Pitt and Penn State. By joining the
Big East, the theory goes, Pitt solidiﬁed the
conference and left Patemo bitter and more
than happy to end the series with the
Panthers. »

» The Panther Theory is not much diffe —
ent, because it does concede that Pitt joining
the Big East did in fact destroy Patemo’s
conference dreams. However, there is a

_ twist. According to the Panther Theory, Penn

State lobbied intensely for admission to the
Big East, before Pitt ever joined, and was
denied, because Penn State basketball added
nothing to the conference. Following Penn
State’s unsuccessful bid to join the Big East,
Pitt was invited to join and accepted
Whatever theory you subscribe to, the
fact  the game is only scheduled for four
more years is a crime against the common-
wealth which requires the intervention of the
governor or state legislature, just as the state
of Texas did several years ago when it threat-
ened to cut off state funding for Texas and
Texas A&M if they discontinued their series.

Bradshaw;

TPN: Were you nervous going
into it?‘

TB: Oh, yeah. Very nervous. If it
had just been me, I wouldn’t have
been nervous. I knew that Jake was
wonderful, it’s just the fact that I
didn’t want to be Pavarotti or any-
thing I just wanted _to sing good
enough to not embarrass
myself.(Laughs) A

er working with Jake than Chuck

Chuck, after we got everything
worked out. (To Kovak) I like how
you worked right ‘ into
that.(laughs)

TPN: Are you planning on doing ,

any live performances?

TB: (Emphatically) We "did a per-
formance. We did a song; it’s not
on the album. We did the song
‘”That’s Enough, T'hat’s Enough”
in Fort Worth for the Texas
Homecoming. So I did that. And I
had a lot of friends who had never
been to a gospel show and to be
quite honest they didn’t want to
come. So I got them to come and
from the very moment the show
started you could see that they
were just captured by it. When
people think of gospel music they
think of Holy Rollers, you know

what they think of. Man I don’t '

think anybody entertains better

    
   

than gospel singers. My kids, my
wife was blown away, not by my
performance, by the show. We did
that one and I’m gonna do a few

4 dates with Jake.

TPN: How would you describe the
sound of gospel music to- some-
body who doesn’t know about it?
TB: This album is for anybody. It’s
bi get now —— a lot of solo stars. I
listen to it all the time and I don’t
know how it sells. Coming into the
21st century, I think people think
more about the afterlife. I’m in my
late 40s. I’ve become more settled
since «my«Steeler days, more spiri-
tual. It feeds your spirit and we
need something that feeds your
spirit. It’s a good way to start your
day. It will kick you in your butt.

he ’d been listening to gospel, Terry
approached us and showed what

First Contact: a rollicking gooclti— um, oh, nver mind

Star Trek: First Contact

Directed by Jonathan Frakes
Starring Patrick Stewart, Jonathan
Frakes, Levar Burton, James
Cromwell, and Alice Krige

I’ll begin by admitting straight up
that I am in no way, shape, or form a
Trekkie, a trekker, nor even really
much of a casual fan of the Star Trek

1 Universe. I’ve always been more of a
’ Star Wars man myself. I do really dig

the old episodes of the original series
for their kitschy ﬂavor, and I watched
theoriginal feature ﬁlm when it was on
HBO somewhere around 1980. I saw
Wrath of Kahn on TV when I was a kid.
I’m pretty sure that those are the only
two Trek ﬁlms I’ve ever seen (at least
in their entirety) previous to this one. I
have seen a few episodes of “The Next
Generation,” enough to have a periph-
eral awareness of the characters. To be
perfectly honest, I was oblivious to all
the hype surrounding the impending
release of this ﬁlm until Paramount
called me and asked if I wanted to go
see it. Friends of mine who I never
would have guessed were into Star
Trek were freaking out when they
heard, and everyone has been asking
me how I liked it.

Well, the answer is I’m not really
sure. Perhaps it doesn’t really matter

how much I liked this film. It held my
interest, and was amusing. I would say
that everyone else in the audience (all

ﬁlm critics of one form or another) .
‘pretty much seemed to love the thing.

There was clapping, cheering, and

”WE wILL

IECHNOLOGICAL

”WE ARE THE

laughing going on throughout the ﬁlm;
exactly the sort of behavior that you
wouldn’t expect a bunch of ﬁlm critics
to engage in. When we exited the
screening room, everyone raved about
the movie. I still wasn’t sure what I

thought. The special effects were of
course superb, and I’m sure quote-
whores all across the country will tag
First Contact things like “a rollicking

good time” and “perhaps the best Trek ,

yet.” The film was directed by
Jonathan Frakes, who plays
Commander William Riker on the
show and in the ﬁlm.

For those of you interested in a
narrative recap (without giving away
too many juicy surprises), here it is.
Everyone knows by now that this ﬁlm
features the “Next Generation” cast as
they duke it out with the infamous
Borg, an evil race of cyber—organic
aliens popularized on the series. The
singular mission of these creatures is to
assimilate all life forms in the galaxy
into the collective consciousness of
their hive mind. For the first time ever,
we are introduced to the leader of the
Borg, the seductively manipulative
Borg Queen, played by Alice Krige.

The Borg are planning to assimi-
late Earth in this ﬁlm, and of course the
only folks capable of stopping them are
the crew of the newly constructed
Enterprise-E. They pursue the Borg
through a hole in the space—time con-
tinuum (or some such nonsense) and
wind up in Montana in the 21st centu-

Music and symbolism i|owthroughThe English Patient

The English Patient
Directed by Anthony
Minghella

Starring Ralph Fiennes,
Juliette Binoche, Willem
Dafoe, and Kristin Scott
Thomas

I always enjoy going to the
movies, so when I received a
call from a friend of mine who
works for Miramax Films
(Swingers, Pulp Fiction) offer—
ing free tickets to attend a
sneak preview of an upcoming
ﬁlm, I accepted the tickets
without hesitation. I really did-
n’t know what to expect from
the movie based on the little
information I had received
beforehand, but I thought that
since the tickets were free I

wouldn’t lose anything even if
the movie wasn’t that great.
As soon as my friends and

7 I entered the theater and sat

down, I had a feeling that I was
about to witness a great movie
and as it turns out, I was right.
The ﬁlm that I went to see was
entitled The English Patient
and ‘I stress the word ﬁlm
because the directors and actors
went beyond just making a
piece of entertainment for the
general public. Instead they
created something beautiful
and magniﬁcent on the screen
— something that was meant to
be experienced and not just
viewed.

As The English Patient
opened, the most unusual and
exotic music was playing as a

hand sketched the ﬁgure of a
person gliding in water upon
the surface of a rock.‘
Immediately, the combination
of the soft, melodic music and
the slowly moving paintbrush
captivated me and left me in a
trance—like state, where I
remained throughout the entire
ﬁlm. The same style of music
and the symbolism of water
continued within The English
Patient and it ﬂowed into every
crack and crevice of the movie,
which not only served to con-
nect the different aspects and
characters of the story, but also
to leave the viewers feeling as
if they were traveling within a
liquid that was everchanging
and yet the same throughout.

A Minor Forest

Flemish Altruism (constituent parts ‘93-
’96)

Thrill Jockey Records

The title of the album tells you right
away that a lot of time went into these
songs. This record, the ﬁrst and soon to be
followed effort from A Minor Forest , is a
double LP on Thrill Jockey Records. An
upcoming split LP with Gainer will soon
be released on Divot Records.

Even the jacket is cool, featuring a
“Color Transparency” which, when
opened, reveals a blank space surrounded
by the usual important infomiation. This
album boasts some great producing minds
at work in the studio. Steve Albini, of
Nirvana and Breeders fame, contributes to
ﬁve of the 10 tracks, while Bob Weston,
who has helped Polvo along much of their
way, masterrninds the other ﬁve.
Conveniently, Albini does the even tracks,
and Weston does the odd, so you can alter-
nate back and forth between your apprecia-
tion for two currently inﬂuential guys
behind the boards.

Albini gets credit for the ﬁrst full—on
rocker, “Bill’s Mom Likes to Fuck.” The
song starts slow, but culminates in a fero-
cious onslaught of drawn out screaming,
strurrrrning, and feedback This song sounds
similar to Slint sometimes, or maybe
Rodan, when things get chaotic. Other
times, on songs like “Ed is Fifty,” a softer
voice accompanied by a pleasingly minimal

rhythm arrangement comes through like an
emotional Seam song. But expect ﬂuctua—
tions because the tide will undoubtedly turn
choppy. “So Jesus Was At the Last Supper”
contains some chunky chorus rilfs with
well-placed breaks that will deﬁnitely
inspire some knee-drumrning. Lots of dif-
ferent parts make up the arrangement of this
song.

As it turns out, diverse arrangements
occur throughout most of the songs on the
album. But remember, four years went in to
these songs, and they weren’t spent solely
on creating an inexhaustible source of
sounds. The numerous parts, some of which
you can easily miscount in a single song,
demand attention with their potency. So
don’t expect the insufferable, but rather
enjoy the multitude of songs within songs, if
you will, that doesn’t stop at just one record.

Tricky
Pre-Millennium Tension

As a product of the English club scene,
Tricky spawned what is best described as
“trip-hop”: a kind of cerebral, ‘‘let’s get
high” dance fodder for British hipsters.
Although the t1ip—hop label is one which
Tricky detests, it is ditﬁcult to describe a
form of music that sounds like nothing else.

Panhellenic Association

Maxinquaye, Tricky introduced an apoc-
olyptic fusion of hardcore drum beats, hyp—
notic piano riffs, demented whispers, and
beautifully angry lyrics, appealing to listen—
ers on levels that modern rap music doesn’t
often reach.

Pre—Millennium Tension is the artist’s
invitation to the big end—of—the-world—as—
we—know-it party. Just as the Wu—Tang
Clan’s RZA creates futuristic beats for the
b—boy bluntheads, Tricky makes noise for a
new generation of listeners who like drugs
with their dancing. The moody, ambient
vocals of his wife, Martine Topley—Bird
serve as the angelic narration for Tricky’s
twisted autobiography. Check her rhyming
as an angry youth who looks death in the
face on “Bad Dream.” “They had me
trapped, so I rushed back/ they tried to bust
me, but they don’t have enough capsl I
dipped, dived, slipped, slid —— they missed
me! I had to move quick or they was bound
to get me] One bullet grazed rne/ that didn’t
phase me/ What could I say? I was havin’ a
fucked-up day.” It’s not always about what
Martine says, but the way she says it. Her
mood ranges from erotically soulful
(“Makes Me Wanna Die”) to barren loneli-
ness (“Vent”) to downright pissed-off, as on
the frenetic Eric B. and Rakirn cover,
“Lyrics of Fury.”

\V1th Pre-Millennium Tension, Tricky
has produced an eclectic collection of tracks
which leaves the listener in a state of con-
fused satisfaction. How do you react to
music that may make you want to kill,
dance, fuck, and cry all at the same time?
The suffocated energy of the album is sup-
plemented by timely sarnples ranging from

the Commodores to Slick Rick, but it is not
enough for Tricky to merely sample an
artist. He’ll pick apart a drum beat and slow

it down to the point of distortion, warping ‘

what was once familiar and trite, establish-
ing a trippy framework for songs that
become painfully wicked. ,

Tricky’s music, like that of Portishead
and Massive Attack, deﬁes categorization
into any of the labels traditionally reserved
for such purpose. Good luck ﬁnding it in the
record store. You can call it jungle, trip-hop,
black alternative, or whatever. Sleep if you
must, but Tricky will continue to offer his
own moody brand of music for the cherr1i—
ca1ly—irnbalanced, intellectual, would-be
weirdo in all of us.

Cake
Fashion Nugget
Capricorn Records
Although Cake’s first album,

Motorcade of Generosity, was terribly

ignored by the general public, its second I

attempt, Fashion Nugget is ﬁnally garner-
ing a bit of recognition.

The first single off Fashion Nugget,
“The Distance,” is getting plenty of air—time
on radio stations throughout the country and
on MTV. This is a bit odd, considering the
lack of variety of their usual play lists. The
ﬁrst thing ‘you notice about Cake is that they
are different from most anything out there.

But what is it that makes Cake so
unique? That’s really a tough question to

Sound 

answer. When I try to explain
Cake’s brand of music to my
friends, I usually tell them, “It’s
the best music I can’t describe.”

It’s truly great stuff. I have
been listening to Fashion Nugget
almost constanﬂy from the day I
purchased it, but I still have trou-
ble putting my ﬁnger on why it
works so well.

Cake takes a stab at this ques-
tion on their web site, calling
themselves “a juggernaut of musi-
cal enjoyment, stiidently hailing
from Califomia’s fertile Central
Valley, playing high—irnpact, easy-
listening music.”

Still, it doesn’t explain Cake’s
variety. Although there is a bit of
lounge inﬂuence in their music, it
is also highly active. Each of
Cake’s songs is an intense groove
that you can’t help but tap your
foot to — but it’s not the loud
obtrusive kind of beat.

This diversity is also marked
by the way each member’s talents
come through in the music. One
minute, Victor Damiani’s funky
bass lines catch your attention; the
next minute, Vince Di Fiore’s
trumpet blows you away; and the
next, Greg Brown’s banjo—like
guitar makes its way to the fore-
front.

Cake’s songs range from the
jazzy, syncopated beats on tracks

 . . . . ...‘:.,a ...y f of ’_ /.- y, za
’   . F. -> * ‘ ”

  

of C_cipricorn:.ilecords I if

_Cou'rlesy

like “Frank Sinatra” and “The
Distance,” to soft melodic love
songs like “Friend is a Four—Letter
Wor ” and “She’ll Come Back to
Me.” .

If you want an example of
Cake’s variety, you need only to
examine the three cover songs
that are included in Fashion
Nugget. Cake covers the classic
disco tune, “I Wﬂl Survive,” along
with Wﬂhe Nelson’s “Sad Songs
and Waltzes,” and the tango—inﬂu—
enced “Perhaps, Perhaps,
Perhaps.” All three come from
very different genres, but Cake
manages to put their own twist on
them, so that they ﬁt perfectly
alongside their original works.

While the music may be very
difficult to describe, the lyrics are
a different story. This does not
mean they are shallow; itmeans
they are very focused.

There is a very sarcastic tone
to much of Cake’s songs. A lot of
humor is involved, but there are
also some very contemplative
moments, as well.

“Even the saddest moments

of life contain some comical ele- .

ments,” says John McCrea, the
vocalist for the band.

For example, "The Distance”
takes a humorous look at a race
car driver who continues his race
long after it is over. At the same
time, it is revealing a man that is
very deluded in his emotions:
“He’s going for distance/he’s
going for speed/she’s all alone/all
alone in her time of need.”

This ironic tale is about peo-
ple gettting distracted by unini-
portant goals. “He substitutes his
own imagination for what’s really
going on in his life,” explains
Brown. A

The cleverly crafted lyrics go
along perfectly with Cake’s
sound. The whole package is
blended into one of the most
unique CDs to be released this
year. While Cake may be hard to
describe, they are definitely not
hard to enjoy.

Cake will be playing with
Counting Crows at the A.J.
Palumbo Theater on Sunday, Nov.
24.

Patient 

ticular, right before and during
WWII. Large portions of the
story take place in Northern
Africa around the area of Egypt,
as well as in a bombed—out
monastery in southern Italy. The
story focuses on members of the
Royal English Geographical
Society who were sent into the
noithem part of Africa to draw
detailed maps of the area and
compile data that could be used
in battle should war break out.
This is what makes The English
Patient so different, from any
other war drama that I’ve seen;

the film does not dwell on the

intense battle scenes, but rather
on a select group of people who
were important to the war effort
but who are rarely thought of as
being material for a book or
movie about the war. However,
the director and actors took hold
of the originality of the plot and
transformed it into something
remarkable and truly outstand-
ing.

What makes the ﬁlm incred-
ible is the fact that two stories are
unfolding within. It is the old
play within a play technique that
many famous authors and play-
wrights have used throughout the
ages, but there is a creative hitch
that is included within this film
— some of the characters are pre-

 

 
 

  FROM PAGE 

sent in both stories but the audi-
ence is kept in the dark about
which ones they are for a long
time. The way the director is able
to create this sense of two con-
verging plot lines is through the
extensive use of ﬂashbacks trig-
gered by common symbols found
within both stories of the film.
The English Patient is a ﬁlm

about ﬁiends, enemies, and pas— .

sionate lovers who cross the
boundaries of country and race,
yet are divided by them in the
end, and the drive to pursue and
explore all possibilities within the
world and within the realm of
reason. It is a film about love and
hate, compassion and revenge,
sadness and joy. It is a ﬁlm that
touches on all aspects of human
emotion and life and makes the
characters come alive so that the
audience feels that they know
them. One of the last lines within
the ﬁlm was, “The heart is an
organ of fire...” The English
Patient, through its wonderful
directing and acting, has deﬁnite-
ly brought that across to the audi-
ence so that everyone who views
the movie experiences the ulti-
mate power of human love and
passion. Go see the ﬁlm. It is well
worth it.

ry (that’s a few hundred years before the
time of the Enterprise crew). The date is
April 4, 2063, the day before the Earth’s
“first contact” with an alien life form.
This meeting is made possible by
Zephram Cochrane’s legendary warp
drive ﬂight in his rocket, the Phoenix.
Cochrane is a historic ﬁgure akin to
George Washington in the world of Star
Trek; his ﬂight makes the creation of the
Federation possible. The peaceful coexis-
tence and cooperation of humans in a
post—apocalyptic 21st century society is
pretty much Trek ‘ creator Gene
Roddenben'y’s original vision for the
future. The Borg seek to change history
by preventing allof this.

While Picard and the gang engage
the Borg on board the Enterprise while
orbiting the 21st century Earth, a team is
deployed to Montana to try to help the
Phoenix launch take place. We get to
meet Cochrane, played by James
Cromwell (of Babe fame). The
Enterprise crew is surprised to find that
their beloved hero is a hopeless drunk.
There are some funny scenes involving
the ship’s counselor Troi and some tequi-
la. It’s a real riot, you know  ha ha.

Meanwhile, Picard and Dataget busy
with the sexy—scary Borg Queen on the
Enterprise. She has special interest in
Picard, because he was once assimilated
by the Borg (on the “Next Generation”

episode “Best of Both Worlds”), but man-

aged to recover. Data, being a cybernetic
being who seeks to be human, is an inter-
esting case for the Borg Queen to work
on.

Even with my limited Trek experi-
ence, I could tell that a lot of familiar
themes that have been explored before on
the show were examined in this f1lm..This
is probably good and bad. We really
become privy to Picard’s inner self more
than ever, which is quite interesting, since
everyone knows that Picard is the prover-
bial shit. He’s one badass motherfucker,
and in this film we get to see all sides of
the man. The opening shot of the ﬁlm is
easily First Contact ‘s most impressive

moment. It took ﬁve months to shoot the
single pull-back shot, which, when seen
on the big screen, will really blow you
away. Also impressive is the score, by
Academy Award—winning composer

Jerry Goldsmith, who hasn’t worked on a‘

Trek project since the original film.

I’m sure that everyone who wants to
will go_to see this film, and I doubt many
of them will be disappointed. It does have
a slightly darker edge, which Ienjoyed,
and considering the “even (good)/odd
(bad)” Star Trek ﬁlm syndrome that I’ve
heard so much about, it’s bound to be bet-
ter than the next one.
