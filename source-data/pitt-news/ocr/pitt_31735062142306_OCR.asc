Current Season

Next Tuesday

Pitt Town meeting, sponsored
jointly by the YM and YWCA, will
open its current season next Tues-

, day. A wide variety of subject mat-

ter interesting to both students
and faculty will come up before the
platform-for discussion according
to Vic Carlson, chairman. Included
in the weekly programs are topics
of educational, social, economic,
religious, and personal signiﬁcance.
Always popular with the peo-
ple at the University, Town
meeting is going into its third
year. A committee of faculty and
students are working on a variety
of interesting speakers, Carlson
said.
The international situation is the

was not ready for the opening
day, plans are under way to have it
ready for next Wednesday’s sales.

Well on the way toward a goal set
at $20,000, committee members
sold $1,496.80 in bonds, and $116.75
in stamps. Several members of Chi
Omega and Kappa Alpha Theta,
women’s social fraternities, aided in
the sales eﬁorts.

Approximately 13 1) 0t e n ti al
sales days remain until the end of '
this semester, and committee
members pan to share sales activi-
ties with various other campus
organizations.

According to a tentative schedule
introduced by the committee at a
meeting of Student-Facuty asso-
ciation recently, groups other than
fraternities will participate. SFA
members have volunteered to take
their place in the booth on some
Wednesday in the future, and Men’s
Council has agreed to help furnish
the sales personnel for a single
sales day also.

Although sales receipts for the
initial day of selling were higher
than expected, members of the sales
staff will be out to double their
intake next week, according to Bill
Pankuch, C44, publicity director.

“Success or failure,” said Hartz,
“are the two alternatives we face
in this drive. The responsibility
for both, however, rests not in the
hands of the committee, but of the
students and faculty members.
Let's see all of you at-that booth
on Wednesday.”

Stamps and bonds are sold from
the second through the seventh
periodeach Wednesday.

Pittsburgh’s branch of the American Red Cross will again
send a mobile blood bank unit to Pitt. The unit will operate
in the Cathedral for four days: October 19, 20, 21, and 22.

A quota of 150 volunteers
per day has been set by the
Red Cross. The total of 600
students for the four days will
be taken care of by a complete-
ly equipped staff of doctors,
nurses, and assistants.

The bank will operate from 12 to
5 o’clock erich of the four days.
Students should register for ap-
pointments as soon as possible. Ap-
plication blanks may be obtained
at the Men’s Student Health serv-
ice, 34th floor, Cathedral, or at a
booth that will be set up on the
ground floor.

Students under 21 must obtain
the written consent of a parent.
Volunteers should not eat before
reporting for their donation.
After giving their blood, they will
receive a free luncheon, served
by the Junior league, a group of
Pittsburgh debutantes, who will
act. as canteen workers. ‘

“This will be a challenge to ﬂag-
wavers,” said D1‘. H. C. Carlson,
director of the Men’s Student
Health service, “a chance for therg
to really do something for their
country.”

Pitt was the ﬁrst school in Pitts-

Rushing Tuesday Morning

Men’s fraternity rush week will begin at 8:30 o’clock
next Tuesday when fraternity men will be alowed to make
their ﬁrst individual contacts with freshmen men. Deadline

for the Tuesday and Wednesday
evening events will be 10:30 o’clock,
and for the other three evening

Rushing rules, as set up by I-F
council, state that after 8:30 o’clock
Tuesday a rushe_e may accept as
many fraternity invitations as he
wishes, but after each evening
deadline all contact with new stu-
dents must end. Furthermore they
state that the week immediately
following rush week shall be
Silence Week, and that no frater-
nity man shall contact any new
student conceining fraternity mat-
ters-. .

Beginning Tuesday, fraternity
men will go all out in‘ their efforts
to pledge new men with a series
of daily lunches, dinners, picnics,
bowling parties, smokers, and
theater parties. Saturday night

will be devoted to the traditional
rushing dance at each of the
houses.

Instead o'f the streamlined “o-pen”
rushing, of the summer semester,
the fraternities will revert to their
usual “closed” rushing policy of the
past.

French Room For Dedication in November

By DOROTHY RUMBAUGH
The French Nationality Room,
located between the Fifth Avenue
and Bclleﬁeld entrances and ad-
joining the unﬁnished Norwegian
room, will be completed and opened
for use by the end of November.
To the Pitt students these na-
tionality rooms are truly a course
in the history of architecture for
both the Fench and the Italian
rooms have derived their in-
spirations from the classical
Greek architecture. And, al-
though there are a thousand
years between the two cultures,
the Greek revival is evident
throughout the room.
Designed to represent the French
Empire Period, ‘the furniture will

ornaments.

To harmonize with the bright
scholar blue of the student chairs,
the walls are of soft French Em-
pire gray and present a translu-
cent eﬁect. The carved wood pillas-
ters are at present decorated with
ornaments covered with bronze
powder, but when the room is com-
pleted they will be of gold ‘leaf.
These ornaments are suggestive of
the Napoleonic conquest of Egypt.

The windows of the French
Nationality Room will be covered
by yellow-gold brocade hangings
ornamented by Empire laurel
wreaths. The polished parkay
ﬂoor and metal chandelier with
crystal drops add the ﬁnishing
Empire 'pc-riad Iﬂllfil‘-.',‘S to the
room.

The typical blue, gold, and gray
color scheme of the room was de-
signed by Paul Cret, a well-known
French architect from Philadelphia.
Probably the most marked charac-
teristic of the French room is its
perfect symmetry.

Mrs. Ruth Mitchell, adviser on

the nationality room sums up the

French room by her assertion,
“Among all the nationality rooms,
the French room will be the most

.‘‘elegant’’ —— with its damask cur-

tains, hard, polished ﬂoor and blue
mahogany furniture.”

Like the Italian Room, the
French "Room is also a “student
interest” room because of the
large number of students inthe

Hospitalization
Registrations
End Tomorrow

Eligibility for the University's
student hospitalization will end to-
morrow, according to the Treasur-
er’s oﬁice. Students not paid up at
the oﬁice by that time will not be
allowed to take part in the beneﬁts
of the student hospitalization plan
this semester.

D1‘. Clifford Carlson, director of
the Men’s Health Service, advises
both men and women to take ad-
vantage of this plan, and it is_very
signiﬁcant that only 575 students
out of the University's entire en-
rollment last semester applied for
this hospitalization.

Many cases of students’ failure
to take advantage of this service
last year‘ that resultedlater in
ﬁnancial worries were cited by
Dr. Carlson.

Last semester 32 of the 575 stu-
dents enrolled in the hospitalization
plan were hospital cases. These
students spent a total of 204 days
in the hospital, having themselves
$1,250.80.

Because of the tri-semester plan,
the fee for a semester is $2.25.

Players to Tour

A Tryouts for Pitt Players ﬁrst
production, “Abe Lincoln In_Illi-

players will meet today at 2:30
o’clock in 332 Cathedral to map a
rehearsal schedule and to discuss
the other plays that will be pre-
sented during the current school
year. 4 '

“Abe Lincoln In Illinois” will
open at the end of this’ month in
the. Foster memorial. A tour of at
least six districts of the city for
one night performances will then
be taken.

It is expected that the show will

sylvania Historical society build-
ing, the auditorium of the Hill
housing project, and in the various
playground districts of the Pitts-
burgh Bureau of Recreation.

In addition to the above recitals
‘the Board of Directors is consider-

farm of art activity to be an-

languages. They sing rollicking
folk songs, yodels and mountain
calls; they play the great music of
the past on picturesque block—ﬂutes,

the woodwinds of the ﬁfteenth cen-
tury. And audiences love them.

It is completely understandable
that audiences should. The whole
family stands in a little circle, per-
fectly poised, completely at ease,
beaming with pleasure and making
a solid little community in them-
selves. Theirs isn’t a concert pres-
ence; it’s just a family enjoying
themselves singing.

The Trapps sing a-capella, just
as manygenerations of Austrian
hill folks did before them. As Bar-
oness von Trapp once explained in
an interview, “In the times of our
ancestors, everybody sang. Nobody
was an artist, but that didn’t mat-
ter. Now people think only artists
can sing. That is tragic.” The
Trapps are doing much to keep
alive that in-born belief in song
that not even the Nazi invaders of
their little country can smash. The
Baroness however, failed to add
that her family sings with a vocal
quality pure, naive, and musically
ﬂawless.

Dorothy Maynor, Singer, is

So

oist, November 

At Carnegie Music

Dorothy Maynor will open the sixty-ninth year of the Pittsburgh Art Society with a
concert at Carnegie Music Hall on November 9.

Miss Maynor, modest young Negro soprano, has created a sensation in the music:

world with her beautiful voice and unaffected artistry. Yet it is not so long ago since

Dorothy Maynor, an unknown,
went to listen to music at the
Berkshire Festival conducted
by Serge Koussevitzky, leader of

the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
and ended by making music herself
for the great conductor. T

He praised her in the highest
terms and critics who were present
proclaimed her the discovery of the
decade. A sold-out house greeted
her concert debut in New York, and
the rest of the story is a triumph
recallingthe ﬁrst appearances in
New York of Tibbett, Pens, and
Flagstad. 7

She is still incredulous about her
success. On the concert platform,
just as in private life, she is friend-
ly, sincere, and refreshingly mod-
est. The range of her voice is re-
markable, going from brilliant and
breathtaking high notes to the dark
deep tones characteristic of her
race.

Miss
spellbound as her big, velvety voice

Maynor’s audiences sit
swings out in a brace of difficult
Lieder, as she croons, as her fault-
less coloratura swells out in a rev-

erent spiritual.

“Were you there when they
cruciﬁed my Lord?” she sings alone
before a sea of faces. “Were you
there?” The great voice falls into
a perfect pianissimo and fades into
silence. And a dark woman, dressed
in cloth‘of gold, smiles as an en-
raptured audience speaks its mind.
Again and again and again music
lovers, critics, musicians demand
that Dorothy, Maynor sing, simply
and beautifully; that she take their

hearts and ﬁll them with sorrow

when her golden, true voice asks,
in the most magniﬁcent spiritual of
them a1l—“Were you there, were
you there?”

There she stands, this daughter
of a colored Baptist preacher in
Virginia. She is a college woman,
she speaks the languages necessary
to music as perfectly and ﬂuently

as she speaks her own tongue. Her
German and Italian are a joy to
hear.

She will be in Pittsburgh next
month. Go to hear hep. Listen to

Huehn, Conner Seen Here

Julius Huehn and Nadine Con-
ner will present a joint concert

under the auspices of the Pitts-
burgh Art Society at Carnegie
Music Hall on February 8.

Miss Conner is a brilliant young
soprano who has been gaining a
reputation in musical circles
throughout the country. She has
appeared with great success on re-
cent radio programs with Nelson
Eddy, and is hailed as one of the
most promising of the rising Met-
ropolitan stars.

Mr. Huehn has the distinction of
being the youngest leading bari-
tone of the Metropolitan Opera as-
sociation, .where his remarkable
voice won him the part of gruff,
faithful Kurwenal in “Tristan and
Isolde,” with Melchior and Flag-
stad.

Huehn came to Pittsburgh as a

summers working in his father’s
steel plate mill. While in college,
he joined a small dance orchestra,
and there his singing attractedthe
attention of Pittsburgh’s musi-
clans.

Within a year of voice study, he
won the Pittsburgh and Pennsyl-
vania prizes in a National Radio
Contest, and his ambition to study
in New York was realized when he
was awarded a fellowship at the
Juilliard Graduate school.

His leading baritone roles in
“Jack and the Beanstalk” and
“Helen Retires” started him on his

auspicious professional musical ca-

reer. Beside his success at the

Hogtying The War Effort P1'z‘z‘pourrj,,

This is a new war, a new kind of ﬁghting,
with new methods of murder, destruction,
communications and occupation.

The basic artifacts of this war, however,
are the basic artifacts of every war: men and
materials, the ﬁghters and the weapons they

‘ ‘use.

The question of materials has become a

’ serious one. Since Pearl Harbor, the problem

has been bungled‘: fully as much as it
was in pre-Pearl Harbor, isolationist America.

The problem of man-power has been even
more perniciously bungled than that of mate-
rial. Not enough men have been called quick-
ly enough; nor have those called been sent
where they should have been sent.

There is one question that cannot be
answered precisely: “How many men is
enough?"

Enough for what? Enough to open a second
front? Enough to stall a J ap drive into India
or Australia, or into both? Enough to man a
100,000 plane air force ?

Well, we don’t know, and neither does
Lewis B. Hershey or George Fielding Eliot.
Every estimate that might be made would
have to be revised in the light of the latest
developments. The answer might be derived
by a Master Mathematician with all the facts
at hand of Stalingrad, the Caucasus, China,
Egypt, India,_ Guadaul canal and the Atlantic
Ocean front.

And then, when he had closed his sliderule

‘and added the ﬁnal ﬁgures, he would have to

start the process again with the next edi-
tion’s headlines. _ _
The obvious answer to what is enough is

Churchill Versus lnclia
Presents Military Danger

B’ M'I[‘tIIi‘e"cxdnIﬁliI<?toli’eStlVfv‘een the English government and

India is no longer a matter concerning only those‘ two
peoples. With the Japanese poised in Burma. Waltlpg
for the end of the rainy season, India presents a mili-
tary danger that could result in the defeat of the
United Nations or at least a considerable elongation
of the war.

A successful invasion of India and a simul-
taneous thrust by Rommell across Egypt Would
create a ‘pincers on the allied middle east forces
and lead to a union of the Japanese with the Ger-
mans. The domain of the Axis would then extend
from the French coast around the globe to the
Aleutian Islands.

The military and economic implications of. such
action are obvious. To mention a few, the Chinese
army would be outﬂanked. Practically all supplies to
Russia, -China, and the Middle east would be cut off.
The possibility of exchange of materialsbetween
Axis partners and the exploitation of the natural
and industrial resources of new great territories,
would be gained by the Fascists.

A condemnation of the Indian’s action at this

-time is not in order when approached from the.
Indian’s point of view. The ignorance, poverty and
degradation which the 300,000,000 people of India
have endured during British domination represents
imperialist exploitation at its worst.

As far as we are concerned it would be nice to

_ have the Indians postpone their rioting, but they
’ realize that if they are ever to see independence in

(this generation thy must force the British to give it
to them now. Too often have they been promised free-
dom only to see the promises forgotten.

Undeniably disorder and bloodshed is likely to
be the immediate result of the granting of inde-
pendence. The various revolutionary groups will
struggle for power and there is a possibility that
the reactionary Congress party will dominate. But

 when there is no question but that the Japanese

will try to usurp India’s new won independence, is
it not probable that the masses and power groups
will unite in face of the common danger?

And will they then not welcome British and
American troops, who will come in as equal allies to
help, defend Indian independence rather than as
policemen to defend India’s own wealth.

The true meaning of the Japanese Fascist new

order would be brought home to the Oriental world.’

' The ability of British and American troops to

' defend India with most of the population uncoop-

erative or openly hostile is extremely doubtful when
one remembers what happened in Burma.

Winston Churchill who has taken his stand on

A the Cripps offer, which was after all just another

promise, and who stated that the Atlantic Charter
did not apply to India, casts reﬂection on the British
‘purpose in ﬁghting this war, for it can very logically
be argued that he is protecting that portion of the
British ruling class which is beneﬁting handsomely
from the exploitation of the natives. Or perhaps the
‘prime minister is afraid that a loss of the empire may
result in socialism in England in order to utilize the
_available resources of the island eﬁiciently enough

“more than enough.”

_But_that’s an answer that won’t go in a
situation where we must split up our man-
power between industry, agriculture, ship-
ping and the soldiery, and where there may
not be enough to go around.

We’ve been bungling the job just'as the
British did. Only, the British seem to have
proﬁted by their mistakes and we have not
proﬁted by either theirs or ours.

The British went all through the painful
process. Their technical specialists, engineers,
coal miners, et al, were sent to France as regu-
lar foot—soldiers. Later they were recalled and
sent into their proper work, but not until a
great deal of damage had been done and a lot
of precious time lost.

Over here, we are starting from scratch,
instead of proﬁting from past experiences.

Those who would stop the muddling are
hog-tied by “political expediency.”

In Washington, the War Manpower Com-
mission of Paul Vories McNutt has done noth-
ing except to have forms printed. No printed
form ever stopped a bullet.

The WMC must wait until after the No-
vember elections.

The drafting of 18 and 19-year-olds must
be held up until the incumbents can safely
be recumbent again.

Von Bock and Rundstedt and the little
greenclad men on the road to Australia won’t
wait for the voting inachines to be locked and
the returns counted. The dead Russians and
those yet to die won’t spring back to life-in
November.

There's a stiff penalty for imper-
sonating an oﬁicer, but what is the
sentence for a couple of fellows
posing as Pittpourri writers so as
to worm their way into the conﬁ-
dence of innocent freshman girls?
Esbie Longabaugh and Larry Ham-
ilton used this ruse to get the phone
numbers and names of attractive
co—eds Doris Stickel, Ginny King,
and Peggy Boulus.

Several other lovely freshmen
that probably intrigued them are
Elizabeth Maytag, Olive May Gray,
and Winnie Jarvis.

_Most recent Lothario to take
his place in the Bunny Frankie
date list is Phi Ep Jimmy Deutel-
baum who but just awhile ago
was going quite steady with
Techite Margie Baer.

Ian Henderson wandered into the

half an hour telling jokes to Janet;

Bill Newstetter turned out to
be a guinea pig the other day. He
asked Mary Lou McFa1l for a
date and found out to his disimiy
that she went steady back home
and woiildn’t date. At least now
Pitt men may know the facts, but
how long will they remain so?

Sigma Chi’s showed a lot of
school spirit at the game Saturday-.
Paul Schaughency and the boys
provided a lot of entertainment
with their ballons. The Dents with

the show.

| Off The Record 

By A. G. SIDNEY

This year Beegle comes out with
the first musical offering. A Puccini
popular called La Boheme; an ex-
cellent choice, this is probably the
most well-known in Puccini's long
list of Italian Operas. His many
works abound in technical resource,
dramatic invention, and power of
emotional expression. The best
known are Manon, Tosca, Madam
Butterﬂy, and La Boheme. They
are tremendously effective when
seen upon the stage; whether we
like them or not depends upon our
taste for the Italian operatic con-
ventions.

Funny thing, Boheme is an
opera concerned with the French
written by an Italian and sung in
Italian. However, the management
of this itinerant company is adding
another innovation. They are
signing the Italian-French Opera
in English. This ought to be an in-
teresting experiment to view.
What with everything to gain in
the realm of modernism, and only
chaos to lose, its an even money
bet for an interesting evening.

Manager Wagner claims a full
orchestra of thirty. Yet we know
that beauty and balance demand an
orchestra of at least forty-ﬁve. The
Pittsburgh symphony has ninety
odd members in its ensemble. How
can this statement be reconciled?
Simply enough. Wagner knows that
beauty and balance must unite to
provide truly ﬁne music. Therefore
get an arrangement that requires
only thirty men. You lose beauty
but retain balance . . . retain the
“effect” of a solid orchestral en-p
semble at the expense of tonality
and timbre.

What you will hear this Saturday
therefore, will not be the original
score, but the original Puccini
music harnessed and boundto the
whim and dictates of an unknown
arranger!

One cannot say that the effect
will be good or bad. Music is rela-
tive. What you like, I might de-
test; and vica versa. In this case
the ends justify the means. The
rendition of good opera, with the
partial sacriﬁce of a few musical

 G Campus, Visitors Mutua.lIy
Impress Each other

A By IRWIN ROSEN

~.

The same note of Allied unity as was touched at the famous

International Student Assembly, was struck on campus Wed-
nesday, as the University played host to ﬁve United Nations

war heroes.

The group spoke at Foster memorial, where they echoed
the thoughts of world youth on the present war.

“We’re ﬁghting for a better, more decent world, a world
united and free,” Captain Peter Cochrane of the Cameron
Highlanders told the gathering. .

“The youth of the Soviet Union ﬁghts for freedom. Ger

man fascism must be crushed.

Forward to victory! Death to

Fascism!” were the Words of Nikolai Krasavchenko, head of
the Moscow youth organiaztion.

, “I know that someday I shall go home again, side by side
withsoldiers of the Allied Nations, who will once again. set

"my people free,” promised the
‘Raden Abdul Kadir, of the
etherlands East Indies.

-Miss Yung Wang, Chinese
actress, told students of her
dramatic organization, which has
made scores of trips to the front
lines to cheer the wounded and the
‘ﬁghting. She described her ﬂight
from China into Hongkong, her
jpursuit by the Japanese “gestapo,”
her narrow escape from the far east.

“Using all m.y knowledge of
stage make-up, I disguised myself
as‘ an old Buddhist lady, and was
not bothered,” she said.

Vladimir Pchelitsev told the
assembly of the pressing need for
a second front n0w—-“While Ger-
many has 90 per cent of her troops
along the Russian battle front,
she cannot possibly invade Eng-
land or America. We defend,
therefore, your own, as well as our
freedom. A second front now, by
helping the speedy elimination of
Fascism, would end this war
sooner, and Would, in the ﬁnal an-
alysis, save lives,” he declared.

Unexpected was the appearance
at the meeting of a sergeant in the
Polish Air Force—Thomas.Kbiniski,
who promised that “We will win
this war—we shall crush the num-
her one bandit ofthe world.”

Following the meeting, the group,
with eight or ten university stu-
dents had lunch at the Fairfax din-
ing room. Then a broadcast over

Next, the group was taken around
industrial Pittsburgh, saw the mills,
housing projects, parks, schools.
Most interested in the city tour was
Krasavchenko, who is preparing a
journal of his trip for the youth of
Russia.

All the visitors were impressed
with the Commons room. And Miss
Wang, taken into the Chinese
room, refused to leave until she ex-
plained to each member of the
party, what all the writing and
stone carving signiﬁed.

Raden Kadir could only say
“Matchless!” when shown the lux-
urious Syrian room.

At 6 o’clock SFA honored the
group iwith a banquet in the
F'aculty club. It was here that
each visitor sang songs" of his
people, and many University stu-
dents got their ﬁrst taste of what .
real folk music is like.

Capt. Cochrane sang a Scottish
drinking song——“Just a Wee Dock-
in’, Doris,” Lt. Pchelintsev sang a

Russian love song, while Miss
Wang sang “Chee Lai,” the song

of the Chinese volunteer army. And
Abdul Kadir sang the wierdly dis-

cordant folk music of the east.
“Thank you all, you’ve been
wonderful to us,” were the parting
words of. Miss Irene Murray, tour
manager, as she and her group

continued their tour of the nation’s
campuses, which will end next
week, when the soldiers will be
called back for action.

Phi Sigma to Meet

ology, will speak on “The Effect of
Colchincine on Baby Chicks” at a
meeting of the Phi Sigma Society
Friday evening, October 16, in 1009

Thompson, of Mellon institute, ._is
president of the group.

Warnock Opens

WSGA Lecture
Series Tuesday

The employment council of Wom-
en’s Self Government association
is opening a series of vocational
lectures for the women of tlie Uni-
versity. Each lecture will be given
by a woman in a ﬁeld of work that
is out of the ordinary. The employ-
ment council, headed by Grace

, Lyon, C43, feels that the ordinary

ﬁelds of work are sufficiently clear
to the women and that the newer
and more unique vocations- would
be more interesting. ' 
The ﬁrst of the “Career of th .
Month” lectures will be given by ’
Elizabeth Warnock 3:30 o’clock
Tuesday, October 13, in 1217 Cathe-if
dral. She will discuss “Opportuni-
ties For Women In Aeronautics?’
Miss Warnock has been an in-«

structor at Pitt since the start of*-.

the summer term, teaching the in:-.
structors who now direct the areo-‘ .
nautics courses in the city high
schools. ‘

For three years, Miss Warnock . ' _

has been working at Bettis air-' a
port as an instructor in ground
work as well as ﬂight training.
Although she is an all-around
average girl, Miss Warnock is an
able pilot with many hours ﬂying
time. p
\ Miss Warnock believes that the
aeronautical industry is in need 
female help. There are openings ii:
meteorology, airways traflic con-
trol, radio, weather observation,
and mechanical and piloting work.
After her lecture, Miss Warnock
will conduct a forum and all women.
are urged to attend. ‘ 

Men in Service Receive   
Most of Universityis Mail} ‘

Three out of every ﬁve of the
letters handled by the university
post office on the first ﬂoor are
sent to men in the service. This
information was revealed by Leslie
Seybold, a mail clerk who has han-
dled student and faculty mail at
Pitt for over a year.

Of the average 500 pounds of
daily incoming and outgoing mail,
over 200 pounds go to the Regis-
trar’s oﬂice alone. Agnes Adam,

the newest post office employee, as-
sists in the continuous job of sell-
ing almost ﬁve dollars of stamps
daily, handling “V” mail, foreign
letters, and sorting faculty letters.

_“Despite the high percentage of
mail to service men, which of
course only proves that Pitt stu-
dents are excellent morale build-
ers, it is interesting to note that

Women  laceGym Program
On  We/artirne Basis  

Physical education for Women at
Pitt has been put on a, war basis,
according to Minnie L. Lynnand
Gwendolyn Drew, new directors of
the department. '-

Since so many women are being
inducted into the WAACS and
WAVES, this year’s physical edu-
cation program will be designed
around conditioning courses in Dan-
ish gymnastics, exercises which re-
quire neither supervision nor equip-
ment.‘ ‘According to Miss Lynn,
these fundamental a exercises will
give women trained in their appli-
cation a personal program to use
throughout life. '

_Several recent graduates of the
department have already joined
women’s service groups. Grace A.
Richards, ’40, was one of the first
ﬁve Pittsburgh women to be con-
sidered for oﬁicer candidates in the
WAVES.

The rest of the program in the
department will stress leadership
in community recreation to relieve
difficulties created by wartime de-

nnui

MISS DREW MISS LYNN
mands. Miss Drew explained that
square dancingiwill be an import-
ant feature of the depa ment’s
training this year, in order t at the
girls will be able to teach and call
the ﬁgures in schools and commu-
nity groups-.

Bowling, volleyball, speedball,
badminton and tumbling are
other activities selected because
of their value in group recreation.
All the seniors in physical educa-
tion are qualiﬁed to teach ﬁrst
aid, Miss Drew announced, as
part of their war training, and
most of them can teach life sav-
ing also.

HEN you’re about to telephone, remember that

busier than ever before, with war calls. We can’t build
new equipment to carry the load because the materials
we need are going into ships and planes and shells.
Here’s how you can help "to keep the lines open for

don’t use Long Distance service. But i-f you must,
please make your calls as short as you can.

Coacli Carlson
Calls Annual Fall

Cage Practice

“With the hope of molding 3
combination that will better last
season’s dismal record of 5 wins and
15 losses, Dr. H. Cliﬁ’ord Carlson,
Pitt's basketball coach, has called
the ﬁrst cage practice of the year
for next Wednesday afternoon.

Equipment will be distributed the‘

day before, Tuesday,‘and the two
month conditioning grind will begin
the next day.

Besides losing last year’s co-
captains, Larry Palfrath, Eddie
Ziolkowski and J i in in y Egan
through graduation, this season’s
Blue and Gold squad will be minus
two men because of the war. Harry
Mathews, diminitive forward, who
had been counted on for regular
duty this season is in the army,
while George Michaelowskis, /6
foot, 4-inch star of last year’s
freshman team is in the air corps.

. However, more than a dozen men
will be on hand when the opening
practice sessions start. Back from
last year are Tay Malarkey, Bobby
Artman, Paul Lohmeyer, Steve
Shuber, John Swacus, M a r c e 1
Spartz, Walter Jones, Lloyd Carl-
son, and Mendell Silverman. Com-
ing up from the freshman team
are Barrett, Latagliatta, and Ale-
ander. Loren Braner of the football
squad will report at the end of the
grid campaign.

Available during the second
half of the season as soon as he
completes his freshman year in
February will be Paul Goodwin,
six-foot, four-inch cager from
Perry high school.

Carlson stated, “Any able—bodied
man seriously interested in basket-
ball, interested in learning the
skills and becoming physically
conditioned can come out. With the
proper application he ought to dc-
into a better basketball
player and a better student."

Anyone interested is requested to
report to Gate 3 at the Stadium this
Tuesday.

Strong Reserve Unit Makes Gobs

Favorites Over Undermanned Locals

BY JERRY RIPP

Still remembering that last sea-
son they did the “impossible” by
upsetting a highly favored Ford-
ham Ram 13-0, Pitt's revitalized
football Panthers journey to Cleve-
land today where they face the

Great Lakes Naval Training Sta-
tion team tomorrow afternoon.

On paper Pitt doesn't have a
chance. By sheer numbers Pitt is
outclassed by the service squad.
Also the Gobs have a long impres-
sive list of former college and pro-
fessional stars.

Luckily, however, for the Blue
and Gold, games are won and lost
on the ﬁeld and not on paper. Pitt
will deﬁnitely be the underdog to-
morrow and it seems that only a
miracle can win the game for them.

But, the Panthers showed last
week that they do have a team cap-
able of causing lots of trouble for
the opposition. Last Saturday
against S.M.U. Pitt was again the
underdog, and yet they came out
on the ﬁeld determined to win and
did so with ease.

Spirit in a team; the will to win
is a great thing, but sometimes even
though a team gives its all for a
win, the strength of the opposition

is just too strong. This seems to be
the case tomorrow.

Great Lakes has a backﬁeld that
can cause even the stoutest line to
give ground. Pete Kmetovic, Stan-
ford’s brilliant quarterback of last
season, Bruce Smith and Bob Swei-
ger, Minnesota’s hard driving half-
backs, and Rudy Mucha, former
Washington University star give
the Gobs a powerhouse backﬁeld.

Add to these deluxe backs seven
hulks of humanity called linemen
and you have a victory nearly every
Saturfday. However, this team is
not invincible. They were beaten in
their opening game this season by
Michigan, 9-0. Last week they came
back to trounce Iowa, 25-0.

Pitt was not expected to be able
to do anything after thebeating
they suffered at the hands of Min-
nesota’s too powerful Gophers. The
fact that they came back and beat
S.M.U. and looked good doing it
means that tomorrow they have a
good chance to pull another “Ford-
ham.”

The Panthers are in good shape
physically as well as psychologic-
ally. Bill Dutton showed last week
that he is on his way to his best
season here. Tony DiMatteo gives
the Panthers a hard runner, the

type that is hard to bring down.
Pitt's line is playing a fast
charging brand of ball and showed
last week that they’re able to open
up holes for the backs to go

through. The pass defense exhibit-
ed against S.M.U. was good enough
to completely bottle-up the Mus-
tangs famed “aerial circus.”

They may not win tomorrow, but
Pitt will show Great Lakes some
real football. Both teams have
shown what they can do and the
Gobs appear to be too strong for
the Panthers. Pitt can win, how-
ever, and may surprise everyone
by doing the “impossible.”

Froslr Footballers Meet
Navy "3" Squad Today

By EARL SURLOFF

While an inspired varsity squad
travels to Cleveland tomorrow to
meet the powerful Great Lakes
Naval Training team, Coach Ralph
Mitterling and a roster of some
twenty-ﬁve odd freshmen hopefuls
will move in on Annapolis today to
tangle with the Midshipmen of the
Navy in a junior-varsity clash.

Today's contest with the Navy
Jay-Vees will be the opening
clash of the current campaign for
the boys from the skiyscrapper
school and by the time the ﬁnal
whistle has sounded, Pitt grid fol-
lowers will have a far better idea
of the possibilities of the youthful
aggregation.

In previous years, the Panther
Junior-Varsity squad was usually
made up of third and fourth string-
ers from the varsity squad. How-
ever, due to the large amount of
former Panther gridders in the
armed services of the country, it
has been necessary to ﬁeld a Jay-
Vee eleven solely from freshmen
candidates.

Although little is actually known
about the strength of the Jungle
Cats, hopes for a local victory are
running high. Thus far this sea-
son, the Annapolis eleven has been
something less than a sensation
and has little if any of the speed,
power, and deception that has
made previous Navy Jay-Vee
teams among the best in the en-
tire eastern circuit.

This sudden let-down in the
strength of Navy gridiron squads
and American

may be attributed in the most part
to the national emergency. Under
the newly inaugurated school pro-
gram, the present midshipmen
complete their education in less
than one-third the amount of time
of previous years. As a_ result the-

athletic program. and especially 

J unior-Varsity sports have bee
forced to take a back.

At the ends for the Panther J ay-
Vee will be Walter Cummins and
Robert Debar; at the tackles, John
Saxon and George Kohut; at the
guards, Ed Davidek and John Luk-

owsky at center, Frank Novak."

Starting at quarterback will be

Pitt Drops Cross Countryi WA

IKE HERMAN

he Faculty Committee on
Athletic Policy for the Uni-
versity has recommended to
athletic officials that cross-
country be dropped from the
inter—col1egiate program for
the duration of the war.

By

_ Lack of epenses and diﬂiculty in
securing transportation were in-
cluded as major factors contribut-
ing to the recommendation. The
committee felt that the train or bus
space saved by keeping the team at
home might be used to better ad-

vantage. And the funds which would
I ordinarily be epended for the cross-

country team could more wisely be
used in building a bigger and better
competitive athletics program.

This decision is in perfect har-
mony with the University’s new,
war-time policy of sounder, health-
ier bodies for a larger number of
the students. Cross-country was
not, at best, a popular sport, and
only ten or ﬁfteen men got any

0 physical beneﬁt from it here at the
University.

The fact that the money allocated
for the competitive athletics pro-
gram, however, is most assuredly
Well spent is shown by the registra-
tion ﬁgures of that program. Over
1500 students have signed up for
training in competitive athletics.

The Faculty Committee on Ath-
letic Policy was formed in 1938 to
take the place of the old Athletic
Council.

Its formation was recommended
by the Council in 1937 when that
body was disbanded. It was then
generally felt that it would be far
better for a faculty group to have
the ﬁnal say on athletic policy’
than on a group of graduates.
And that is how the matter stands
today, with the Faculty Commit-
tee having the ﬁnal say on all
changes in athletic policy.

 

 

V ALDO “IKE” ICARDI

A Behind The Scene Story
With Pitt's Cheerleaders

By ELAINE KAHN
Probably as much a part of the

football game as the players, the
band, or the traditional inebriated
old grads are the cheerleaders.
These are the boys who scream
themselves hoarse, perform minor

acrobatic miracles, and generally
manage to work themselves into
the ﬁrst symptoms of dementia
praecox in an attempt to gain the
proper amount of frenzied enthus-
iasm from the spectators. There is,
furthermore, no group more taken
for granted.

Unfortunately for the cheer-
leader his job consists of more
than just showing up once a week
for a football or basketball game
or an occasioned rally. Behind his
every appearance lie. hours of
practice. And their practice ses-
sions are almost as strenuous as
those of the football team.

At the beginning of the season

the cheerleaders devote two hours
every day to practice. Here they
work to coordinate their movements
to the cheers, to develope “muscle
tone” which means, simply, mak-
ing their movements “speak” the
cheer. Thereafter the practice ses-
sions are held only once a week.

Head cheer leader this year is
Senior Aldo “Ike” Icardi who is
also coaching the squad. “Ike” took
over the coaching duties when Ben
Grady left for the Navy. There
are s-ix other members of the
cheerleading staff, Buzz Yolton,
Arthur Clarke, Charles Fusco,
Owen Cleary, T. J. Donohue, and
the lad who dons the famous Pan-
ther skin on Saturday afternoons
at the Stadium.

Weather conditions make little
difference to the cheerleader. He
always comes out soaked. “I wrung
a pint of water out of my shirt
after the SMU game,” ruefully
comments Icardi.

7 One prediction day last season,

Panther band wagon to notch a
vote in favor of Fordham. What
the Bowser boys did that Saturday,
is now a pleasant exclamation
point on therecord books. Last

pointed to S.M.U. and once again
the fates luckily moved with the

maybe Pitt will do it again. So we
dood it.

DUQUESNE 33, KANSIS CITY 0

Only question in this contest
under the lights tonight will be how
high can the Donellimen send that
scoreboard total? Line, backﬁeld,
defense, offense, weigh it any way
at all, and the balance dips deﬁ-
nitely in favor of Duquesne.

CARNEGIE TECH 19, CASE 6

The Tartans now have that win-
ning habit. It’s a humble habit to
be sure, nationally speaking. But
the kiltie schedule has been built to
compensate for competitive short
comings, thus permitting an occa-

S V ' sional victory.

It won’t happen again for many
moons, this business of seeing the
Gophers on the short end of a foot-
ball score. The Fighting Illini tell
of a couple of ace prospects in
Jimmy Smith and Ray Florek but
this is one pot a pair of aces won’t
win.

IOWA PRE-FLIGHT 20,
MICHIGAN 6

Minnesota is about one touch-
down better than Michigan. Bier-
man’s cadetmen proved to be one

point better than the Gophers.
Therefore, 6 plus 1 times the square
root of Dr. Bertram Squeegie An-

seldorfers’ sixty-nine and three-

quarter second cure for half pint
termites, produces the above score,
obvious even to idiots.
LEHIGH 13, PENN STATE 7
Don’t sell the Lehighmen short.
A well-balanced squad of veterans
and hard working rookies place the

Engineers far above the “push-
over” division. The Lions too are
on that solid beam, so this one can
go either way. But if an upset must
be called, here’s the game for it.
STANFORD 27, NOTRE DAME 6

Notre Dame ain’t what she used
to be, Stanford am. The Indians
should waltz into the West Coast
Conference championship. But the
Irish are in for a sad season; too
many fumbles and no goal line
punch.

INDIANA 21, NEBRASKA 19

Another tough one. The Hoosiers
almost had enough to make Ohio
State’s Paul Brown wish he were
back in the saddle at Massilon.
Nebraska with Bradley and Zik-
mund rates ﬁrst call in the Big Six
-Circuit. Competitively close enough
to ﬁnish even.

Fraternity Circuit
Opens Fail Card

With the newly formed competi-
tive athletic course taking up most

of the time and space of the Trees‘

Gym and Shadyside, ‘the annual
Intramural fall program has got
under way several weeks earlier
than usual.

In the football league both fra-
ternity and independent organiza-
tions are ﬁelding the strongest
teams in many years. In the fra-
ternity bracket, Phi Epsilon Pi,
last year’s title winners once again
has one of the best balanced
elevents in the circuit and has a
better than ever chance of repeat-
ing. ~

However, such houses as Pi
Kappa Alpha, led by the Wilde
boys, and Phi Gamma Delta should
provide more than enough competi-
tion for the Neville Street lads.

The Punks must, as usual, be re-
garded as the outstanding aggrega-
tion in the Independent division. In
winning the Intramural football
trophy last season, the Punks were
undefeated, untied, and unscored
upon.

ls Displayed g
On Seventh Floor

Early and rare maps from the
ﬁfteenth through the eighteenth
centuries will be on display in the
Department of Fine Arts seventh
ﬂoor Cathedral until the middle of
November.

This collection comes largely
from the Darlington Memorial li-
brary. The earliest map shown is
that of the world printed in the
“Nuremburg Chronicle” in 1493
loaned to the University by John
Casey of Pittsburgh. The exhibit
also includes an early sixteenth
century Munster map, maps by
Mercator, Hondius, and famous at-
lases by Ortelius, Blaeu, and other
well-known cartographers.

Considerable emphasis has been
given to America and early maps
signiﬁcant in the development of
American cartography. Many of
these are engraved on copper hand
colored and decorated with gold
leaf.
