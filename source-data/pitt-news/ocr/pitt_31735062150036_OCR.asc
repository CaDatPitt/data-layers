, High spot of the assembly will be the banquet in the Com-
mons Room, where faculty members, alumni, the band, the “gen-
eral public,” and 300 students will honor the varsity and fresh-

man football squads an_d all varsity lettermen.

Attendance at

the affairs is thus expected to exceed 900, according to Richard

Harman, C41, student‘. chairman.

Non—campus speakers" at the Sports assembly will be Major
John L. Griffiths, athletic commissioner of the Western confer-
ence, and H. 0. (Fritz) Crisler, head coach at the University of

Michigan.

Both men have already accepted the invitations

which were sent to them by James H. Hagan, director of

athletics.

' '-Tickets for graduate and undergraduate ‘students which have
been limited because of lack of space to 300,_go on sale today for

_ $1.50. Harman states that student sales havelbeen limited in or-

der that other groups of the University may be properly rep-

resented. -

“Any disproportionate number of tickets going to students

"would freeze out other groups whom we feel should attend the

assembly,” Harmansaid. He pointed’ out that the Commons

. Room, although it will afford the biggest space available, cannot
seat more than 900 comfortably.

Although tickets are available on a “ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served,”
basis, attempts are being made to see that each school and class

receives a fair share. ~

Faculty members can secure tickets from Mr. Hagan, ac-

cording to Harman.

This year’s assembly and banquet, because of its all-Uni-
versity ramiﬁcations, replaces the dinner sponsored last year by

the Student Faculty association.

_are William. McElwain, C41, Mary Ruth Hosey, Ed4l, Charles
Cusick, E43, and Irving Kaufman, C41. Tickets may be secured

Census Bureau Verifies 2  ,
Elmer’s Pojiulatiﬂll Th!’-.0I‘y .

Predicting the present economic
depression as far back as 30 years
ago, only to have the idea ridiculed
as a “screwball notion,” Dr. Manuel
C. Elmer, professor and head of the
department of sociology, recently
found himself in the satisfying posi-
tion of being able to say “I told you
so” to those who had earlier scoffed
at-his idea.’

For _,it wasn’t

“Doctor” Elmer,

1 now recognized as a leading man

in hifsﬁeld all over the country who
proposed the idea back in 1911. It

-. wassimply Manuel C. Elmer, just

another graduate student at a mid-

‘western university who submitted

to his professors material for a
thesis on the problem of the chang-
ing population and its economic
effects;_.in which he predicted a lu-
ture depression because of some un-

-‘checked trends in population.

-, His advisory professors belittled
the idea and told him to turn to

something “more practical,” doubt-

ing ifcany results could be obtained
from such a study. But the young
sociologist “stuck to his guns,” con-

- tinned to gather evidence in support

of his point, picked up a doctorate,
and had some of his works pub-
lished in the meantime.

Then, only a few months ago, Dr.
Elmer realized his triumph, when
he received a letter from the Cen-
sus bureau at Washington, acknowl-
edging the validity of his state-
ment, and commending the work.

According to Dr. Elmer’s theory,

now accepted by almost all popula-
tion experts. our population is so
changing that there is a continually
decreasing number ‘of ' people in
the producing age. and a continuous
increase in the number of people in

. the consuming age who do not pro-

duce. All of which means that
more and ‘.'l’lOl‘€ of our population is

becoming dependent upon fewer
and fewer people "for support.

 For instance, ﬁgures compiled by
Dr. Elmer show that, not only has
there been .a dropin the.bir.th“ rate
since 1830,.,but the aged have been

kept alive. .- longer; ,. and many men‘

of the producing age have been
k'iIled”"in wars “since that period, all
resulting in Dr. Elmer’s conception
of “more and more dependent‘ upon
less and less.”

It was the ﬁnal breakdown of the
cycle, shown when the “less and
less” broke down under the ﬁnanc-
ial strain that resulted. inithe pres-,
ent economic depression, according
to Dr. Elmer.“ ._  ‘ ' ~

Permanent Group

A motion for a permanent Uni-
versity council was passed by the
temporary council during the meet-
ing of November 26, Provost Rufus
H. Fitzgerald, chairman of the
group, revealed today.

The temporary council was es-
tablished in February to serve for
one year and to make recommenda-
tions to the Board of Trustees in
regard to the desirability of estab-
lishing a permanent council.

If organization of similar groups
in other schools is followed, the
council will serve as an advisory
body on educational and adminis-
trative policies and procedures, and
to acquaint faculty members with
Un"versity affairs.

Proposed by the committee to re-
port a permanent council, chair-
manned by Dr. Elmer Hutchisson,
prorésssr and head of the depart-
ment of physics, the motion was
seconded and passed priorto the
committee report.

Only two points of the proposed
pcrmzznent council plan were dis-

proposals. Further consideraticm

To Direct Fifth
Annual Contest

lllore than 250 debaters from
high schools in ‘the Pittsburgh
district‘ will come to the Univer-‘
sity tomorrow‘ to participate in
the ﬁfth annual non-decision
debate tournament —. in Foster
memorial.

Under the direction of Roy H.
Umble, instructor in English, and
Sam Rodgers, C41, student high
school relations manager, the tourn-
ament starts at 9:15 o’clock and is»
open to all high schools in this dis-
trict. _ ,

Dr. Charle-st W. Lomas, instructor
in English, inaugurated the debate
idea several years ago. “Its pur-
pose,”_ he explains, “is to give high
school coaches and their teams a
stimulus, while at the same time
not putting them under the pres-
sure of having to win the debates
so as to have a good. record.”
Non-Decision Tourney

No decision was given in these
debates, for the purpose of the
tournament is to learn, Dr. Lomas
states. Advice is given by a group
of critics composed of one member
of the faculty from each high
school. In case the high schools do
not iurnish enough judges, mem-
bers of the freshman debate squad
will act as critics for debates in
which they themselves do not par-
ticipate.

Schools which have already reg-
istered for tomorrow’s tourney are:
St. Thomas, lVIcKees Rocks, Stowe,
West Newton, Ellwood City, Con-
nellsville, Claysville, Coraopolis,
Centerville, Redstone, Derry town-

War Aims:
What and Where

The United States is of course at war.

‘Naturally War is not fought by the soldier
alone. Someone has to make the guns, the ships,
the airplanes, the tanks, the uniforms, the food.
The United States at the present time is at work
supplying war materials for her allies. Few
Americans are ﬁghting at the front, now.

The president has repeatedly assured the
citizens of the U. S. that under no conditions
will he send soldiers to ﬁght in a European war.
A European war may therefore be deﬁned as
any war in which the U. S. has not yet man-
euvered troops.

There’s a bare possibility though that we may
send troops. And so before they start ﬁghting
at the front, 1et’s ﬁgure what they’ll be ﬁghting
for way over there. Let’s ﬁgure out the “war
aims.”

Of course in the present phase of our little
war we are ﬁghting for democracy and against
fascism. We are to understand that fascism is
an aggressive force seeking to overrun the world.
We’re next on the list. OK.

Let’s deﬁne fascism now. Fascism is the kind
of government we don’t have and don’t want.
'That’s ﬁne.

In our country we have a great deal of racial
prejudice. We don’t allow 7 or 8 million negroes
to Vote in the South; we restrict real estate to
“Anglo-Saxons”; we separate negroes and whites
in the democratic army; we advertise for “Anglo-
:Saxons only.” Naturally then racial prejudice is
by no stretch of the imagination fascism, because
we’ve got plenty of that. And We’re not fascists,
not us.

VVe know whom we’re ﬁghting. We’re ﬁght-
ing the dreadful fascists who mistreat minorities
so shamefully. We know what We’re trying to
keep out of the VVestern Hemisphere. We sure
do, don’t we?

 Take religion. We in America believe in re-

‘ligious freedom. Of course we persecute the J e- »

h_ovah’s Witnesses, the Catholics, the Paciﬁsts and
the Jews. So religious persecution isn’t fascist.
’Cause we do a little persecuting of our own
and we’re not fascists, are we?

“ But think of Germany and those downtrod-
den Jews and the Witnesses in the concentra-
tion camps. It’s frightful. We’re going to help
put a stop to that kind of thing. Yep, we’ll go
o_v'er’ there and show them what we mean by
religious freedom. You bet.

 And economics. Well it has been bruited
about that our economic life is either run largely
by a capitalist upper class that owns practically
everything worth owning through monopoly, in-
terlocking directorates, banks, and stocks and
bonds. Or else the economics of the country is
at the mercy of a small group of bureaucrats in
‘Washington sitting around a polished desk on
which desk is a private telephone line directly
from the White House. This top heavy economic
structure cannot be called fascist, because, as we
all know, the U. S. is not a fascist nation, nohow.

' But when we look at Germany with her Nazi
bureaucracy put into power by the munitions,
banking and steel trusts, we get hopping mad.
It’s -a shame to see the honest German people
ground under the heels of such top heavy
tyranny. We’re glad We’re on the right side
against such evident wrong. We sure are.

It’s too bad we never corrected that far sight-

edness the doctors told us about. They kept tell-
ing us and we never did much about it. Can’t
see a thing right in front of our eyes. Why we
might not even get to ﬁght ’cause our eyes are

so bad. We probably wouldn’t know whom to ‘

shoot at. ‘

Broolcs~Continues Study

INDIAN SUMMER
by Van Wyck Brooks

A few years ago a distinguished literary study ap-
peared on the bookstands. It was called The Flower-
ing Of New England and its author was Van Wyck
Brooks, then known to onlya small group Of Ameri-
can scholars.

Its companion volume, New England: Indian Sum-
mrer, 1865-1915, is one of the most important books of
the fall literary season. It has come off the press at
a time when American literature is at the crossroads.
The great writers of ten years ago—William Faulkner,
John. Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe,
Sinclair Lewis——have faded or are fading out of the
literary scene, and there are no new and exciting young
writers to replace them. Its appearance is almost sym-
bolical: it was issued only a few weeks before the
posthumous You Can’t Go Home Again by Th0maS
Wolfe and the novel that represents the maturation of
a great man of letters, Hemingway’s For Whom The
Bells Toll. It implies in its title, Indian Summer, that
American letters are to undergo impressive changes
that may hamper, and perhaps injure, their course for
years to come.

W. D. Howells’ Eyes

New England: Indian Summer opens with the ar-
rival of William Dean Howells in Boston in 1866. This
slight, moustached Ohioan had nothing to commend
him except a sensitivity and appreciation of literary
patterns—and a poem in The Atlantic. The canvas of
Boston after the Civil war then unfolds through the
eyes of Howells. Holmes, the Autocrat of the Break-
fast table, who could talk on two successive nights for
eight hours and never permit a lag in the conversa-
tion; Alcott, Longfellow, and Lowell, no longer young
men, but as gray and bearded as the portraits of them
that hung in thousands of American living rooms;
grocers who would wrap up your codﬁsh and ask you
if you had yet read Lucille; King’s Chapel, Bunker
Hill, the State House, the old Corner Bookstore, Corn-
hill, and-—yes—the Granary Burial Grounds: these
were the things that Howells saw and that made him,
a sophisticate just returned from a consulship in Venice,
fall in love with Boston. .

But something has happened to the structure of
Boston after the Civil War. Some sly, malignant
worm has penetrated its ﬁrm walls—what the Jazz
Age called its complacency, its smugness—and the re-
sult is a weakening of ﬁber, “feminization” Brooks
calls it. The new generation is skeptical, hard; Presi-
dent Eliot is forced to revise the ﬁrm classic curri-
culum that has distinguished Harvard for two cen-
turies. Money-making becomes the new American
goal.

The New God

Tradition, imagination. and beauty are ignored in
the eyes of this cruel, new god who knows what it
wants and goes after it. The immigrant population of
Boston begins to increase, cheap shacks grow up in
the backyards of elm—lined New England towns, there
is talk of dangerous radical philosophers who are
ﬂourishing in the capitals of Europe. This is the New
England of 1900.

Brooks closes his study of literary trends in New
England with a chapter called Second March. To the
young reader this is one of the most signiﬁcant parts
of the book. Names that we grew up with are com-
mon here: E. E. Cummings, Edna St. Vincent Millay,
Robert F: ost, Eugene O’Neill, Thornton Wilder. Espe-
cially noteworthy is the criticism of T. S. Eliot; this
is done with a superb sense of irony and with a tongue-
in-cheek ‘that lashes Eliot more severely than a dozen
academicians.——Angelo M. Bruno.

NEW ENGLAND:

 

Oscar Sheﬂer

[Editor’s note: The author of this column has a
friend, Mr. Nettik, who lives on a desert island just
off Canarsie. Nettik has lived without any of the
comforts of modern civilization—-autos, radio, or two-
way stretches—for the past 350 years or so. His only
form of communication with the mainland is through
our columnist, who ships him mss. in coke bottles.
Mr. Nettik, through this means, has accumulated a
graphic picture of American progress and thirty-seven
dollars, seventy cents worth of coke bottles.]

Dear Nettik:

This has been a busy month or two. First off, we
elected a president. Not much to it. We waited a

-few months, listened totspeeches, watched parades,

read all the newspapers from cover to cover. Figured
we were the big men, and the moon would explode if
Mrs. Schmutz didn’t cast her vote. Come election day,
we got shoved into a little booth, pushed a few but-
tons, and it was all over. Wanted to stay and keep
pushing buttons and making a big celebration. But it
all ended in about 90 seconds ﬂat.» When you and I
get that Utopia business going we’ll ﬁgure out a way
to keep them interested, have machines paying off in
ni.ckels or serving ﬁsh sandwiches.

We had some trouble with a thing called Thanks-
giving. Thanksgiving is where you’re supposed to be
meek and humble and grateful for everything. So the
Democrats and Republicans made faces at each other
and Mrs. Parry (she’s a columnist), who just got ﬁn-
ished with the horrors of sending American boys into
war without being prepared, thinks it pretty nasty
of the President (we still have a president) to be
keeping families apart on Thanksgiving.

That war is still going on over on the other side
of your island. You remember, war is where two
parties are spending a lot of money and ﬁghting so
one can lose something and the other can keep what
it already has. Our side is ﬁghting to preserve de-
mocracy like last time. They had a lot of buttons
printed to defend America by aiding the allies, then
had to toss them all out when there weren’t any more
allies. The Italians are ﬁghting the Greeks now, and it
is like Russia and Finland, but without snow.

The English are still being bombed and muddling
through, and some people think there’s going to be a
dictator in this country, but there isn’t any imporant
news except that it looks like Claudette Colbert is
going to get a divorce.

Flashbacks :

’Way back in ’37, when the place
was over-run by an aggregation
called the Rover boys, and Gene
Pyle’s Clint Sipe was coupling with
Dottie Ridsdale . . Mary Lewis
went to the Charter day ball with
Cliff Carlson, and the Pi Lams had
a new pledge with literary talents
whom they dubbed “Florence Fish-
er” Kalwary . . . romance was ru-
mored between Senator Ziskind and
Theta Thyrsa Amos . . . and Jack
Hoeveler was telling a tale about
Dick Page who, it seems, curled up
in a back seat and murmured to his
date, “Darling, it makes me cold
just to look at you.”

We move on a year, and Beth
Hughes was being loyal to a Tech
Delt . . . Lois Galbreath was a rec-
ommended freshman and Nancy
Sundstrom and DJ Bailey were a
double talking twosome . . Rae
Young was introducing Tony Nesbit
to Bob Miller, and we musn’t forget
Bob Shaw, the YMCA boy who was
inverting his M’s and getting into
the YWCA.

But Today :

This man, Tom Westerman, nev-
er knows when to quit . . now
its Adeline Butera who is the re-
cipient of all his charms . . .
Bailey calls it a “Life in the back”
Kari Eagle, our globe-trotting
trucker, was another who wrrecked
his car on the way to Duke .
Gene Tedick lost the use of his
right leg and Johnny Shoemaker
lost his voice while Tish Hamilton
lost Rae Young and the team lost
the game.

Louella Parsons, who had her
screen characters in town last week,
pulled the same question from the
bag every day. It was the request
of a Pitt student to date Brenda
Joyce. Of course Louella sloughed
the hypothetical date monger .
Brenda couldn’t do half as well as

Varsity Rifle

_Team, Initiates

Training Grind

With four of last year’s six letter-
men returning, the riﬂe team went

_’ into its ﬁrst practice sessions last

week in preparation for postal
matches with the strongest shoot-
ing aggregations in the country.

Jim Townsend, letterman for two
years and captain this year,
Laspada, Haywood, and Schaper
are the returning sharpshooters. Of
the other two lettermen, Stiﬁey is
lost by graduation and Bates has
failed to report.

Of the remainder of last season’s
squad, Frankovich, Bridges, Eagle,
Wiessman, and Miller have turned
out.

A ﬁne group of sophomores have
come out for the squad and although
Sergeant Macdonald, a s s i s t a n t
coach, believes it is too early to
h.ave a line on them, he names four
who stood out last week. Helbling,
Cengia, Schettler, and Dickinson
appear to be the best of last year’s
freshmen.

Sophomores who desire positions
on the squad are still welcome to
try out, according to Macdonald.

The best record set last year was
when the team placed fourth in the
Hearst national matches. They
were disappointing at the National
Riﬂe association matches in Wash-
ington when they placed ninth
after being tabbed as having a
chance to win the national cham-
pionship.

By almost unanimous agreement
of the News sports staff, Duquesne
placed ten men on the News All-
City football squad; Pitt placed sec-
ond with eight selections; and Car-
negie Tech held down four posi-
tions, PCW and Mt. Mercy failing
to win a berth.

Dominating the ﬁrst team back-
ﬁeld, Tech’s Paul Friedlander and
George Muha were quarterback and
left halfback respectively. Of the
whole Carnegie Tech team, George
Muha, swivel hipped left halfback,
was probably their most valuable
player.

Dcincili Repeats

Repeating again this year at right
halfback, Allen Donelli, brother of
the Duquesne coach, was the shin-
ning light of the Bluff squad. Al-
though Donelli usually holds down
a position on the bench at the start
of every game, his squat one hun-
dred and sixty pounds paces off
more yardage than any of his
heavier team mates.

Pitt's George Kracum polled a
heavy vote for the All-City Full-
back position. Gaining twenty
pounds over the summer Kracum,
a converted halfback, hit his stride
this fall as a fullback. “Krackers”
was chosen by Andy Kerr to be
fullback for the Eastern team,
when they play the East-West game
January ﬁrst in California.

Jack Goodridge and John Ro-
kiskey were given the call at the
terminal posts. Goodridge, Pitt's

Pitt Basketeers Prepare
F or Hard Floor Season

All managers should have their
teams organized and their entries
in 5’ or the winter intramural pro-
gram as soon as possible. Any in-
dependent team wishing to enter
any sport may do so by taking
their roster to Director Potts‘
office.

Early basketball workouts show
seven lettermen and three promis-
ing sophomores making up the ﬁrst
ten as the Pitt cagers prepare for a
gruelling seventeen game schedule
that opens in Madison, Wisconsin,
on December 18.

Last year’s high scorer, Eddie
Straloski, returns to lead the Panth-
er ﬁve this year after two seasons of
brilliant plazy. Red—headed Mel
Port, another veteran of two cam-
paigns, also returns to his custom-
ary post, the center position. One
of the best ﬂoor men in the busi-
ness, Port is one of the most de-
pendableiof the “hot and cold” drib-
blers.

Two in-and-outers, capable of
brilliant play when on, George
Kocheran and Sam Milanovich, and
Jim Klein, a starter his sophomore
year but relegated to second string
last season, round out the ﬁrst ﬁve
at this writing.

The second string is made up of
three sophomores and two juniors.
Outstanding in this group is Larry
Paffrath, who returned to schoool
this year after dropping out of
school at the end of a sensational
sophomore year.

Ed Ziolkowski, another junior, is
a standout performer from last
year’s quintet.

Tay Malarkey, number one pros-
pect from last year’s freshman team,
has been pressing the ﬁrst ﬁve very
hard so iar this session. The last
two sophomores are Johnny Swacus
and Ed Masten, who have been
good enough to keep juniors Egan
and Levin, members of the second
ﬁve last year, off the ﬁrst team.

Fifty Track Enthusiasts
Report to Coach Olson

Over ﬁfty candidates have re-
ported for the indoor track early
practice sessions which started on
Monday of this week. According
to head coach Olson, approximately
200 are expected to turn out when
the last call is sent out.

Included in the large number of
early—bird trackers are quite a few
freshman athletes, many of whom
bear promise of great things in the
future. To further increase the
squad, veterans of past seasons have
already started practice.

To take the place of capable ath-
letes who have been lost through
graduation, Coach Olson has sev-
eral talented performers, each of
whom he hopes will ﬁll the vacated
spots very nicely. With the letter-
men Red Jessup, Hap Stickel, Del
Anderson, Larry Tregonning, and
Bill Carter, the Panther mentor
need not worry too much.

In referring to the freshman can-
didates, Olson stressed the fact that
they need not have had any P1'8V1-
ous track experience in order to try
out for the team.

Although their ﬁrst meet is not to
be held until after the entrance of
the new year, Coach Olson has al-
ready been putting‘ his athletes

  
 

. A second saved here, an unnecessary step
out out ‘there—-on such close attention to
“little” things rests the Bell System’s ability

v'_;t_o provide thee finest, fastest, cheapest tele-

" phone service in the world.

What kind
of Math do you
call this?

It sounds crazy——but let’s see how it would be
perfectly possible in the telephone business.
Suppose an improved method is devised that
clips just one second from the time required
to handle one toll ticket in the accounting de-
partment. Apply this method throughout the
Bell System—handling an average of some
55,000,000 toll tickets each month-and itwould
effect a monthly saving of nearly 1% years!‘

through a thorough workout. He
expects the Pitt squad to be in the
ﬁnest of physical condition come
the new year.

The Blue and Gold track mentor
is somewhat pleased about the
whole track situation and is look-
ing forward to the time when the
present freshman candidates will
represent the varsity. Among the
list of frosh runners there are many
who have plenty of ability already.

New Dealer Gains Favor 
For Aid to Youth, Aged

WPA, AAA Get
Setback in Poll
Among Colleges

By Student Opinion SurvAeysAof America

AUSTIN, TEX., Dec. ,5—Early
in November the voters of" the
nation returned President Roose-
velt to the.\Vl1ite House for a
third term. The New Deal, now
in power for another four years,
will probably grow more and
more to be a permanent com-
ponent of American economy
\Vhich of its features should be
continued; which should, be dis-
carded‘? A

College students have an interest
in the kind of nation they will live
in when they enter active citizen-
ship. Student‘O:pir_1ion Surveys of
America has polled a representa-
tive sample of “the entire United

_ States enrollment in order to arrive

at an accurate ineasurement of col-
lege sentiment. tongthis issue. Most

viewers that What they like about
the New Deal is this: 2 _ A

1.’ ' The’ opportunities it hasA cre-
ated for youth ‘under CCC and NYA.

2. The security it has brought
to the unfortunate aged. "

The WPA and the AAA, the poll

shows, are scored by the greatest:

number of students as the most un-
successful of all the alphabetical

agencies. Failure of the,administra— .

tion to solve unemployment is the
greatest shortcoming of the New
Deal, one out of seven (15 per cent)
believe.

Last April, when Student Opinion
surveys ﬁrst gauged sentiment on
the New Deal, college students sanc-
tioned Ultlcle Sam’s assumption of
social guardianship. But compari-
son of those ﬁgures with the survey
published, today shows increased
concentration of approval on the

Seniors Hear

A °f an
rmy Air Pl

Requirements for entrance as a
ﬂying cadet in the army air corps
were explained to senior men last
Monday by Lt. Laurence S. Semans,
pilot in-"the United States Army Air
corps. 

Lieutenant Semans stated that a
student applicant must be unmar-
ried, a male citizen of this country,

‘20 to 25 years of age, and mu.st

have completed two lull years of
college work. The applicant must
also be in perfect physical condition
and in excellent mental health.

That senior students should ﬁnish
their education and receive a de-
gree was emphasized by Lieutenant
Semans. He explained that a col-
lege degree would give them a bet-
ter opportunity to obtain a commis-
sion in the regular army after
they have graduated from the air
corps school.

He also advised ROTC students to
complete the entire course in mil-
itary science through the summer
encampment and receive the com-
mission of reserve officer in the
coast artillery before applying for
the ﬂying cadets.

First Year Pace

A check-up on seniors who re-
ceived ireshman plaques in their
freshm.an. years, a survey by Rob-
ert R. Corley, assistant dean of
men, shows most ofutéhe ﬁrst year
awardees ‘main.AtainedA their su-
periority scholastically and"~in ac-
tivities throughout their later years.

The check—up was started by
Mr. Corley to determine whether
the qualiﬁcations for A fresh-
men wfereA_adeqAuatAe in gauging their
value in future Ayears. A A 1

Statistics gathered from. ques-
tionaires sent to seniors who had
received freshman plaques show
that they usually rank as high in
their senior class as they did in
their ﬁrst year.

From the members of the class
of 1940, 75 of whom had receiv-
ed plaques, only two of the group
of 34 who answered had less than a
1. average for the period of three
and a half years. Of this group
only eight had less than 20 activ-
ity points. -

said.

A humor-measuring machine, part
of a movie company’s publicity

We aren’t mentioning any names,
but a certain man who parks his hat
in the Panther office is a titterer!
A titterer is one who laughs re-

the joke or because of embarrass-

There are more chuckl.ers than

E ngincers’ Council
Accredits Course

With Full Standing

Full accrediting of the four-
year course in aeronautical engi-
neering as the aeronautical option
of the mechanical engineering dc-
partment has been granted by the
Engineers’ Council for Professional
Development, national accrediting
body for engheering schools and
curricula.

When the School of.‘ Engineering
cst.ablished its professio_nal courses
in aeronautical engineevring in 1928,
the C:Olll‘S£-‘:5 were made an option in
me«:han'2c.al. engineering rather than
a Infglily specialized 1.1ndergraduate
course in aeronautical engineering.
