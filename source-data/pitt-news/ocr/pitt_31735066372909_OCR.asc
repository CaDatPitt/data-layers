Fourteen members of the Coun-
cil of Graduate Students in Educa-
tion (CGSE) have signed a petition
requesting that their 1982-1983
elections be overturned. ‘

The petitioners asked CGSE
advisor, ‘Dr. William B. Thomas,
professor of education, to consider
the May 13 elections as ‘being.
invalid because of what 'they
believe is a breach of CGSE bylaws.

“The question was whether or ,

not those attending the election
meeting were eligible voters, meet-
ing the constitutional criterta of
having attended 50 percent of the
council’s meetings during the year
or -having been an active committee
member," wrote Thomas in a state-
ment released May 29. W
John Abuso, an active CGSE
member who had served as pro-
_gram coordinator secretary for
three years, said he noticed “a
bunch of new guyswhose names

were not on our mailing lists of
* active members,” and brought this

to thé’ attention of the council. ’
,“I raised my hand, and I read the
sections of the bylaws to prevent
violations,” Abuso said. .
After hearing the bylaws, one
non-member said during themeet-
ing, “It's undemocratic.” ,
Still others, "according to ho-

mas’ statement, “not meeting these

constitutional (criteria;-objected on
the grounds that as graduate stu-
dents in education who had paid
student fees, they were entitled to
vote, irrespective of their’ year’s

‘activity in the council.”

After four hours of debate, Elec-
tions Committee chairperson,
Susan Smith, “accepted (legally or
illegally) a vote to permit all
‘attending the May 13 election to
vote,” Thomas said. He said Smith
accepted a vote calling for all pres-
ent at the meeting to elect officers.

‘Soon "after, Smith-allowed eve- -

ryone present to vote. Several active

members then left the meeting,

a because‘ they -felt this was in viola-_
L tion of the bylaws.

‘T suspected ‘they (the non-

members) were invited by certain

ties.” -

Deputy Secretary of State Walter S. Stoeelilr., in i
speech at the Hilton Hotel, said that we arejbound to
Britain regarding the Falklands crisis because of “unique (

candidates,” one of those who left
the meeting before the vote, Abuso
said. 9
Kamal Dora, a candidate for the
office of members-at-large, said the

elections controversy was the result .
of an “ethnic coup!" According to .

Dora, the coup was comprised of
“Africans and Afro-Americans.”
Dora, also African, wrote the
petition protesting the elections.
He said he came to this country
believing in the democratic process
and was dismayed to see the bylaws
violated.
‘ “There have been charges that

some candidates for office encour- V

aged their friends and supporters to
attend the meeting to .vote for
them,” Thomas’- statement said.
“The legitimacy of this charge as

well as the effects such actions may
have had upon the election’s out-

5come must now be examined by the

council’s leaders so as to ju/xtapose
this charge against the constitu-
tional question of what constitutes
legitimate council membership
and voting rights.” .
According to -Abuso, students
maintained that they also had the
right to vote because they had paid
their activity fees. ,
Abuso, however, said it would be
the same as if a taxpaying U.S. citi-
zen who did not register to vote had

gone to the polls on election day,-

demanding the right to vote
because he had paid his taxes.
Dora pointed out that voting is a
privilege and not a right.

D_eputy.Secretary of State Walter
S. Stoessel, Jr. said that much is at
stake in the Falklands crisis during
his May 27, lecture at the Hilton
Hotel, sponsored by the World
Affairs Council (WAC) of
Pittsburgh. ' ‘ —

Stoessel said we are tied to both
England and Argentina.

“When two friends are at war,
American policy cannot be guided
by fear," Stoessel said.

“Britain is a country where we
arc bound by unique tics of friend-
ship values and alliance,”sai(l
Stoessel in a speech originally writ-
ten to be delivered by Secretary of
Statc Alexander M. Haig Jr.-
"Argent inn is an old friend, a coun-'
try of immigrants like our own.

Haig had to cancel in order to

Paul H. Masoner

Roth photo

By DIANE SCIULLO ,

Take the words charming, allur-
ing and enchanting, add to them the
ideal of bettering the quality of edu-
cation ‘around the world and you
come up with what Dr. Paul H.
Masoner of the University of Pitts-
burgh is about.

_“I believe one of the most impor-

tant things in the life of any person, .

’ no matter where that person lives, is

, I
‘ ~ l . ‘ . g \ st ' _

education and the opportunity for
education,” Masoner said. “Those
of us who are interested in educa-
tion have some responsibility to
improve the preparation of teachers
and” thereby improve the quality of
“school. at any level.” ‘

Indeed, Masoner, who received.

his B.A. and M.A. from Ohio State
University and his Ph.D. from Pitt
has concentrated his career on

\

teaching and improving the quality
of education.

He has served in such capacities
as high school civics and history
teacher, counselor, principal and
faculty member of the Program of
Higher Education and dean of Pitt’s
School of Education for 18 years.

Currently, Masoner is" teaching a
course on. comparative education
and is president on the International
Council on Education for Teaching
(ICET).

ICET is a world organization
whose aims Masoner said are pri-
marlily to provide an international
forum for the examination of prob-
lems confronting institutions for
teacher preparation, helping institu-
tions engaged in teacher prepara-
tion to be more responsive to
current needs and stimulating inter-

national cooperation toward
improving the quality of teacher
preparation. ‘

' “The thing we’re concerned with
is trying to improve the quality of
teaching at. all levels—from kinder-

garten through the university—and.

We at least believe we can speak as a
kind of global voice for teacher edu-
cation,” Masoner said. I

The membership of ICET is com-
posed of government organizations,
universities, colleges and ministries
of education from over 70 countries
around the world, as well as individ-
ual members. , ‘

Masoner has visited universities
and colleges in more than 60 coun-
tries, and will travel to Rome this
July for the ICET annual Interna-
tional Assembly.

Past assemblies have been» held in

Egypt, Sweden, Brazil, Korea,
France, England, Argentina, Kenya
and twice in the United States (1955
and 1976). ,

Each year, ICET focuses on a
problem of international concern,
but one of particular significance to
the host country.

“Italy right now is very much
interested in developing a new and
improved program for the prepara-
tion of teachers for primary and
secondary schools,” Masoner said.
“A major focus will be on this issue.

“We will have experts from
around the world who will be speak-
ers, discussion leaders and consul-
tants, and while we may have 100 to
200 people from countries around
the world, there will probably be 300
ltalian- educators attending
working with them.” ~

Masoner will head a one-to-two-
hour session addressing the ques-

'tion of how Italy can undertake a A

major reform of its system for the
preparation /of teachers in the pri-
mary and secondary schools. This
change will take three to five years
of discussion, study and planning.

Currently, Masoner said, the Ital-
ians have a rather minor program
for elementary teachers and almost
no preparation programs aimed
specifically at the preparation of
secondary school teachers.

An individual who is a university
graduate may become‘ a teacher
with no instruction in methodology
of teaching or in various tasks that
ai’e the responsibility of the teacher,
according to Masoner. ‘

-“But I don’t believe any country
should say to another, ‘take our pro-
gram and use it,’ but rather (they
should) look at our programs, at
those in England and other coun-

tries, and then try to identify those _

elements of the program that would
seem most appropriate to Italy,”
Masoner said.

and_

Another concern of ICET,
according to Masoner, are the prob-
lems facing the developing
countries.

“One problem is the massive
increase in school population,” he
said. “While in this country, we’re in
the circumstance where educa-
tional populations are declining
because of the birthrate, in most

fessor Paul H. Masoner;

developing nations, it’s quite «

contrary.”
/ He cited China as an example of

this. It has a population of one bil-,

lion, but only 600 universities.

Out of every 1,000 applicants,.

only one is admitted to a college or
university in China, according to
Masoner. ~ ,

“One reason developing coun-
tries are not ready for this expan-
sion in growthof student population
is because there are not enough
qualified teachers, and so our organ-
ization tries to provide advisory ser-
vice, technical assistance and
consultant service to countries
everywhere,” Masoner said.

“Everywhere people are reaching
for a better way to teach. They're
reaching for a better way to develop
educational programs, and in most
countries, they’re looking for ways
to expand the educational oppor-
tunity to many more people- We
sometimes fail in this country to
realize what a problem that is in the
rest of the world because, for a long
time, we’ve had ample opportunity
for education.”

In recognition of his outstanding
contributions in international edu-
tcation, and his service as dean, Pitt’s
School of Education honored Dr.
Masoner by initiating a lecture ser-
ies in‘his name.

The lectures emphasize interna-
tional aspects of education, and are
given by leading scholars from the
international education community.

  einz Chapel ChoirTours

By JIIWSHAUGHNESSY

The Heinz Chapel Choir of Pitt
recently returned! from a’ one-
month concert tour of France-—a
tour that its conductor, Grover
Wilki_ns III, calls “the most musi-
cally successful of- our many
tours.”

The 1982 tour was the third tour
of France that the Choir has made,
with the previous two being in
_l978 and 1980.

Although ‘the Choir had toured

Europe b€f0rC, it was Wilkins who

' ‘ﬂbnceived the idea of a tour exclu-
sively for France. Wilkins is Pitt's

director of Orchestral and ‘Choral
Activities.’ _

“I’ve been touring all/my life,”
Wilkins said. “I was in France on
.vacation and it seemed like an
interesting thing to do. It looked
like there was a market for our kind
of choir there.” v »

The Heinz Chapel Choir is an
unaccompanied ensemble ’ com-
posed ‘of 40 students. A

Contrary to what. its name
implies, the Choir no longer per-
forms the religious services at the
Chapel, as it had until 1964. When
Pitt became a state-supported insti-
tution in I964, this choir function
«iﬁett. I

It was replaced with a very differ-
ent function-——the discovery and
promotion of new or lesser known
music. .

“We are very active, aggressive
proponents of new music and
rather lesser kown works in the
choral repertoire, especially Amer-
ican. That’s our position as
musicians——to be curious about
new music and to get it in front of
the public,” Wilkins said. “Every-
thing on our program this year was
written in the 20th century."

The program taken the 1982
France tour was the regular one

that the Choir had performed in its A
y concerts at Pitt this year.

“Va-rious versions of the reper-
toire ‘were performed, depending
on the audience.

In Mulhouse, the Choir per-
formed an altered version for the
sparse turnout. A fuller program
-was presented in Paris where “we
had the biggest audience in Paris
that we’ve ever had," Wilkins said.

Larger audiences were also
encountered in Lyon, Firminy and
St. julien Molin—Molette.

It was in these cities that the
Choir was really presented with the
opportunity to ‘acquire French
culture. ‘ I

., French families in these towns,

aeretl to keep a choir member for
a night. This enabled choir

members to establish personal con—.

tacts and learn a little about the
French way of life. These personal
contacts interested Wilkins.

“I was interested in person—to-
person contact. That’s why I
recommended that students take

“We areizery active,
aggressive propo-
nents of new music
and rather lesser
known works in the
-choral repertoire,
especially Ameri-
can, That’s our
position as musi-
cians—-gto be curious
about new music
and toget it in front
of the public.”

French because it's very important
for us to go understanding what we
are doing," Wilkins said.

I 'To beeeligible to participate on
the tour, choir members had to-

. have at leastsone term of French

and one term of an independent
study course in French culture.
When asked about future French
tours, Wilkins replied that “we
have been invited back. I assume

S

that if things work out as they have
in the past, we will go.”

The great cost of the tourlimits
it to a biannual occurrence. The
1982 French tour was made possi-
ble by grants from the Heinz Foun-
dation, the Pittsburgh Foundation
and many individual donations.
The generosity of these donors
resulted in minimalexpense on the
part of choir members, according
to Wilkins.

In the years between. French
tours, the Choir tours various areas
of North America. Recentdomestic
tours included Pennsylvania as
well as Canada, California and the
,South—East. v

The Choir gives concerts around
Pittsburgh as well as participating
in musical events as diverse. as sing-
ing with the Pittsburgh Ballet and
appearing with Barry Manilow in
his I980 and 1981 concerts, Wilkins
said. ‘

Wilkins plans to continue giv-
ing regular concerts at the univer-
sity as well as continuing the
annual touring by the Choir.

“There’s less and lessigoing on
in terms of student travel, and.
that’s why it’s important that we
continue to do this. Our approach
to the international aspect is very
good, and I hope for that reason
among others that. we continue."

rotesters Say
urrent Foreign  
Policies Unfair .

By DANA REED

Last Thursday. tnore than I00
protestors demonstrated outside of
-the Pittsburgh Hilton Hotel
against the expected presence of
Secretary of State Alexander Haig.

Haig was to zl(l(lI't‘._SS the World
Affairs Coun_cil of Pittsburgh, but
was unable to attend due to an
urgent meeting of the Organiza-
tion of American States. The meet-
ting was called in response to
developments in the Falklands
crisis.

I)etnonstration officials said
there would have been a higher
turnout had Haig showed up.

In _Haig's absence, the State
I)epartme,nt sent Deputy Secretary
of State Wztlterj. Stoessel, who de-
livered the speech concerning the
Reagan Administration's strains
on'gU.S. relationships with coun-
tries in Latin America.

The demonstration was initiated
by the Central America Mobiliza-
tion Coalition‘of Pittsburgh, and
was attended by various other Pitts-
burgh organizations, including the
Pittsburghers Against Apartheid,
the Thomas Merton Center and
other peace and anti-war groups.

The concerns of the protesters

‘covered a wide spectrum of issues;
the Reagan Adminstration’s for-

eign policies in Central America‘
and South Africa, the presence of
the South African consulate in
Pittsburgh and the cutting of the
military budget to providejobs and
funding for human needs, accord-
ing to speeches given by various
protestors. ' A, L

The protestors’ chants could be
heard for city blocks,‘ at times
drowning out the sounds of sub-
way construction. '

“Money for jobs, not for war,”
“ll.S. out of El Salvador," Reagan
says yes, we say no, the South Afri-
can consulate has got to go,’_’ “Rea-
gan, Haig you can't hide, we
charge you with genocide," were

some of the chants shouted aloud

and in‘unison by the protestors.
Carol McAllister. representing
the Central America Coalition,
spoke of her organization’s con-
cerns regarding the Reagan
Adminis.tration’s support for the

military dictatorships in Central
America and their attempts to over-
throw the government of
Nicaragua. ‘ A A’

She cited the governments of El

Salvador, Guatemala and the.Hon- , ‘
duras as the main recipient_of the

U.S. military aid in that region.
“Reagan and Haig are killing
thousands of people in Central
America and the world as they
supply millions of dollars in mil-
itary aid to these bloodthirsty
regimes," McAllistersaid. “Rea-
gan should take that money and
use it to provide jobs for the mil-
lions of unemployed Americans

attd to restore the social services he

has axed."

Jake Milliones, representing the if

Pittsburghers Against Apartheid,
spoke of the Reagan Administra-
tion’s close ties with the govern-
ment of South Africa. .
“Reagan and his cronies are to be
condemned for their support and
association with the racist and fas-

cist govermnnet of South Africa,”

Milliones said.

Milliones also spoke out against
the presence of the South African
consulate in Pittsburgh, and called
for it to be closed permanently.

Molly Rush, representing the
Thomas Merton Center of Pitts-
burgh, condemned Reagan’s
nuclear. policies and called upon
the Reagan Administration to cut

- the military budget to fund human

needs and social services.

Mrs. Rush is. a member of the
“Plowshares Eight,” a group of
peace activists that entered a
nuclear warhead. manufacturing
plant in -King of Prussia, Pennsyl-
vania; and smashed the nose cones
of_ nuclear missiles in protest of the
nuclear arms race.

She was given a prison sentence,
but is free pending appeal.

The demonstration was peaceful.
‘ and orderly, and no confrontations

ensued.

Carol McAllister ended the dem-
onstration saying, ‘-‘Things may
not have changed in Central Amer-

ica and South Africa, but in Pitts-'

burgh and the rest of the country,
people are catching on to what
Reagan is really up to.”

offers the Soviet Union the oppor-
tunity to become involved in the
Western Hemisphere. He added
that Cuba and Nicaragua are eager

“We hope that it will not become

Stoessel also commented on
other facets of Latin America.

He said the March 28 election in
El Salvador reaffirmed faith in its

He also said the governments of
Costa Rica and Honduras have
taken steps towards democracy
even though there have been
Cuban and Nicaraguan attempts to
undermine them. .

“The democratic voc.a tion

endures," he said.

Stoessel added that “this stability
must not be confused with the sta-
tus quo.

“Responsible democratic insti-

individual human rights,” said

Stoessel, who holds the second-
liigliest post i-ii the State

By MARK STROUP

\ Efforts by the United States and

the Soviet Union to engageiii arms
talks have actually stalled nuclear
disarmament, according to Paul
Mazur, convener of ‘Pax Christi
Pittsburgh of the International
Catholic Peace Movement.

“The United States and the
Soviet Union are jealous of their
power in the world." and they
began talks to "put down world
opinion," Mazur said yesterday
during his lecttire in the Cathedral.

Mazur said that since the two
world powers began arms talks, the
arms race has increased.

Mazur spoke about the United
Nation‘s (UN) second Special Ses-
sion on Disarmament. to be held
from June 7 to July 9 in New York.

“There is a credibility problem
(with the third world). “and the
UN Disarmament Session involves
many nations in the arms talks,
Mazur said. I

“The third world, non-aligned
nations were the first to call for a
disarmament session,‘-' he said.
"The keystone of this meeting is a
comprehensive proposal for
disarmament.

“People are generally skeptical
about Reagan's (arms) talks. Rea-
gan is talking only about land-
based missiles."

Mazur said a reduction of land-

based missiles is biased in favor of
the U.S. stockpile.

The Soviet Union has also been
preparing propaganda (V for the

After the speech, Stoessel took
questions from the audience-—-
menibers of the WAC participating
in its l9th annual forum.

In reply to one question, Stoessel
reiterated the administration’s sup-
port of land reforms in El Salvador.

"The attitudes and action of con-
gress pressured El Salvador...We‘-ve
made it clear that we support land
reform,” Stoessel said.

Stoessel also saw the future role

of Mexico as “important, active
and helpful in facilitating cont'.ict.s
and dialogue in peaceful change in
Latin America." ‘
The U.S. “welcomes actions and
bilateral approaches_ to (peaceful
change for) countries in the area,"

any sustained public outcry."

In concordance with the Dis-A
armament Session, there will be

public demonstrations in “Pitts-

burgh and elsewhere in the state on

June 5.

‘Mazur said a big step for iiticlear
disarmament would be to stop.
unilaterally or bilaterally, research
and development of nuclear
weapons.

The first disarmament session,
which took place in I978. yielded a
final document that impressed
Mazur.

He said. however. that the arms
race continued despite “the beauti-
ftil thing."

“What's happened since l978'?,"
Mazur asks. ‘ _
He went on to list the prolifera-

tion of nuclear arms and countries
with nuclear arms capabilities.

New Policy And

Planning Method
Provides Options

By NATALIE FRIEDMAN ..

Choices for Pennsylvanians, a
new approach to policy and plan-
ning ‘processes, was discussed by
Walter’ Plosilla, director of Pen-
‘nsylvariia’s Governor's Office of
Policy and Planning, at a lecture
sponsored by Pitt’s‘ Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs (GSPIA).

According to Plosilla, a Pitt
GSPIA alumnus, the new
approach “provides options that
can be picked and chosen between
the government and the private sec-
tor whereas in the past, we tried to
develop washlists of things that
should be done.”

“It is a strategy,” he continued,
during his May 26 speech, “based
on a framework rather than wait-

ing for a master plan to be
completed."
Choices for Pennsylvanians

entails a three-pronged strategy
cent ring around maintenance and
protection of existing firms, an
increase in the birthrate of small
businesses and the seeking of new
firms on a selective basis as
opposed to “smokestack chasing,"
Plosilla said. 

, He added that "under these three
strategies fall four areas of interest:
financial agsistance, human servi-
ces, ihfrastructure and regularity
and tax pialicy."

Financial assistance concerns
give better incentives to firm
employees; enterprise develop-
ment, which ‘involves “taking
existing funding and trying to
target it to distressed areas in urban
communities;” and customized job
training, which matches people
with jobs and funds their training,
Plosilla added.

An example of human services is
summer science programs for out-
standing students.

The programs, such as the one to
be held at Carnegie-Mellon U '
versity this summer, offer young
people experience with computers,
he said. .

Infrastructure, according to P10-
silla, involves such areas as high-
way and bridge maintenance and
the water bond issue, which pro-
vides loans to water authorities,
Plosilla said.

Regularity and tax policy
“creates predictability and stability
in the tax structure and provides
changes in the tax structure for.
small businesses,” according to
Plosilla. S

Plosilla said planning at the
-state level has always been weak,
and there is now a growing in -
ment to focus planning into as
tegic process.

Following the approach of Cho-

ices for Pennsylvanians, he believes ,

that “in 10 years, the state will be
better off than it is today.”

The idea of Choices for Pennsyl-
vanians began when Plosilla and
the Gover-nor’s Office of Policy and
Planning asked the State Planning
Board (SPB), which consists of 15
citizens, five cabinet members and
four legislators, to focus upon their
three highest priorities: economic
development, community conser-
vation and resource management.

The SPB, according to Plosilla ,

then sent surveys to 30,000 Petg

nsylvanians. In addition, they held
30 public meetings throughout the
state and aired a documentary that
attempted to present the state’s
economic development in lay-
men s terms. .

A final report, which presented a
balanced approach to what could
be done. was then issued. From
there, the planning was done in
phases.

“My closing comments to the
group were to remind them of the
complexities of the democratic
process, of the long history of con-
flict and tension in our society over
such very similar issues as who may
and who may not vote and who
may and who may not determine
that action.”_ Thomas’ statement
continued. "I further reminded the
group that constitutions, as impor-
tant as they are, are open to scrut-
iny, debate and interpretation, the
results of which often leave some

interest groups dismayed, but that i

the democratic process in this
society allows them to challenge
and seek redress of grievances.”

Campus Police To Move, Racks

By JUDY GREER

, Q4

Campus police will be moving
four bicycle rack locations in an

7- effort to increase security.

William Tucker, director of the
campus police, said, “we are re-
moving the racks which are hardest
hit. with a minimum of inconven-
ience" to students."

The four racks to be moved are
those currently located -at the
Cathedral of Learning, Hillman
Library, Benedum Hall and
Schenley Hall.

“This way the police can con-
centrate on other areas in the upper
campus,
Tucker said.

According to Tucker, the racks

A f\om both the Cathedral of Learn-
 and Hillman Library will be

relocated to the basement of Forbes
Quadrangle. Here bicycle racks can
' be secured by both camera moni-
tors and a full-time guard already
posted in the garage. .
The rack outside of Benedum
Hall will be relocated from the
Thackeray Street side to the patio
area near the Hall's auditorium.
Due to the renovation of Schen-
ley Hall,,the‘rack there has been
eliminated, according to campus
police officer Arthur Dorman.
Tucker said the number of bicy-
cle rack placements on campus will
be reduced from 15 to 10, but the

total bicycle space capacity will;

r ain the same. _

Dorman said that April through

September is the peak period for
bicycle thefts. '
, According to Dorman, a recent
report compiled by the police
department proposed moving the
current bike rack system toward a
more centralized one. The report
stated that 26 out of 41 attempted
bicycle thefts in 1981 weremade at
the Cathedral, Hillman Library,
Benedum Hall and Schenley Hall.

The figures for attempted bicycle

V thefts from 1980 to 1981 wentdown

from 63 in 1980 to 41 in 1981.

Tucker said the reason for this
decline was the utilization of plain-
clothesmen. The problem with
this, Tucker said, was that “the ser-
vice costs were eating our budget
alive.” Having 15 separate bike
rack locations, according to Tuck-
er,were too many locations to pos-
sibly secure all bikes.

Tucker said that in order‘ to

Pitt. 1 .

DeLuca said there were two .

options: either move the bicycle
racks or hire extra security people._

With the budget cuts the univer-
sity has to deal with, moving the
racks seemed to be the more viable
plan, according to DeLuca.
’ “They are trying to make ‘ar-
rangements to protect our property
while cutting costs,” said DeLuca.

Tucker said students and staff
don't secure their bicycles with
strong locks, and therefore, people
with bolt cutters are able to steal
them. .

Campus police suggest using the
Citadel brand lock. According to a

pamphlet advertising the Citadel, .

this lock is guaranteed.

‘‘If your bicycle is stolen because
of the failure of the Citadel to pre-
vent the theft, we will pay you the
value of your bike up to $200,” the
pamphlet said. ‘

Tucker said he would like toask
for voluntary registration of bicy-
cles so that the campus police can
identify the bicycles by number.

As a result of these measures,

‘ according to Tucker, not only will

the. university community save
their bicycles, but the police can
save dollars on personnel overtime.

The CGSE elections were held to
fill the offices of president, vice-
president, secretary, treasurer and
members-at-large.

The office of CGSE president for
the period beginning July 1. 1982
and ending June 30, 1983 was auto-
matically filled by current vice-
president Marge- Weimer.
According to Abuso, this is a stand-
ard CGSE procedure and is out-
lined in their constitution and
bylaws.

The secretary and treasurer were
not elected as only one person was
running for each office.

-They were accepted as officers by
a unanimous decision.

‘The candidates for the office of
vice-president for 1982-1983 (and
president for 1983-84) were Leki-
Leki Katona and Arlene Seal.

According to a sign-up sheet cir-
culated at the meeting, there were
22 people present for the elections;
13 active members and nine non-
members. A

‘The total number of votes for the
office of vice-president was 31, with
Arlene Seal receiving the majority.

and Matala.

Twenty-eight ballots came in,
with Williams and Matala receiv-
ing the highest number of votes.

The council follows Roberts’
Rules of Order, which do not allow
for absentee ballots or votes by
proxy. However, CGSE members

were not aware of this during the

meeting, Williams said.

She later checked the guidelines
and found that by accepting these
votes, these recent CGSE elections
were in violation of the group's
parliamentary procedure.

assistance of several School of Edu-
cation faculty versed in arbitration,
hoping that they might meet with
the executive councils at their next

Communication’

Gap
Exists

Pitt’s-Student Health Service is once again
finding itself the center of controversy, after
increasing the mandatory health fee from $21 to
$30 per term.

Although any university service that raises its
fees is bound to draw the attention, and in some

cases, the ire of students, the Student Health

Service is unique in that it seems to do every-
to irritate the student
community.

First and foremost, both the health service
and university administrators blatantly ignored
the Student Government Board (SGB) in for-
mulating and announcing the increase.

Looking into the Student Health Service was

a major goal of the board, and one that it‘

worked on extensively. When the health service
tried_ to exclude some questions from a survey
the SGB was preparing, the board chose to
develop its own survey free of interference from
the health. service that obviously has something
to hide. V

And -little wonder: the survey results showed
that given a choice, a majority of Pitt students
wouldn’t even use the service._

Then, illustrating that the university rarely
considers much of what students do seriously,

administrators never gave SGB President Todd‘
. DeLuca an agenda or notification that the

board of trustees would be voting on the fee.

Besides attempting to thwart SGB investiga-
tive efforts, the health service and trustees did
what has typically been done at Pitt; they raised
the fee when most of the’ students were gone for
the summer. I

It’s time for Student Health Service adminis-
trator’s to be reminded that they render a ser-‘
vice, and are obligated to students, instead of
the other way around.

Refusing to cooperate with the elected repre-
sentatives of the student body can go a long way
in harboring resentment and suspicion toward
a service that is becoming more expensive.
Especially when the people who know why
aren’t saying. i

Upset Over Recent Elections

Dear Editor:

The Council of Graduate Stu-
dents in Education (CGSE)_has
long been a significant and auto-
nomous organiiation within the
School of Education. Since its
birth, integrity,
respect have been silent guidelines
for its activities. On _May 13, (the
election meeting) a violation of
bylaws and the democratic process
took place by non-members of
CGSE.

The bylaws identify only “active I

members” can vote at elections.
Active members according to the
bylaws means the registered

, members who have participated in

at least 50 percent of the CGSE
meetings and activities or served on
committees. '

A group of non-members who
showed up on the meeting insisted
to vote on the ground that they are
graduate students at the School of
Education. After a heated argii-
ment for three hours concerning
the non-members’ vote, some

- active members called for postpon-
ing the election until the issue of
membership be settled. Some other
suggested that we may look at the
registered members‘ list and the
people whose names do not appear
should not vote. Unfortunately,
neither suggestions
considered.

In addition, the president of the
council did not interpret the by-
laws concerning active member-
ship. ()ne non-inernber said, “we
may fill out applications for mem-
bership now in order to vote." The

V meeting continued with a lot of

* pressure on the election and execu-
tive committee. Some active
members opposed what was hap-
penirig. but in vain. As a result they
left the meeting.

Students who attended the elec-
tion meeting numbered 22 accord-
. ing to the attendance list. but the
votes for vice president and
members-at-large were greater
than the total iitrmber of names
and signatures appearing on the
attendance list even if we consider
some proxy votes.

Approxitiizrtely 50 percent of the
students who attended the election
meeting were neither active
mernbers nor ineligible for voting
according to the bylaws. In addi-
tion. these non-rneniliers were
known to most of the active
rnemliersand candidates;

equality and .

t

It seems that these students were
brought by some friends or candi-
dates for election meeting! This
makes me wonder about why these
non-members became interested in
our council’s election. Were they
truly interested in the Council?
Where were they during thelschool
year?

As an active member of the
CGSE for three years, I condemn

‘what happened in the election

meeting and I share the majority of
active members (who are concerned

about the council) in considering
the CGSE election is both invalid
and unfair because it violated the
bylaws of the council, as well as the
principles of democracy.

It is our right and responsibility
to request the executive committee
to take action and, call for a new
election to correct what happened

for the sake of the council's integh

rity and continuity.

ArchivesfStory
Corrected  

Dear Editor:

The article on the University .

Archives in the May 26 issue, (“The
Inside Story: The Archives Service
Center”), although comprehen-
sive, contained several errors and
misquotes. There is one serious
_error I must correct.

I never said that the Records Re-
tention Center was part of the Uni-
versity Archives. Located in the

_tCathedral of Learning, it is a unit

of Management Services. The
Records Retention Center, es_tab-
lished in 1976, is a storage facility
for semi-current records there to
relieve offices of those records

_which are infrequently referenced

but must be retained because of
legal or evidential value.

The University Archives, on the
other hand, preserves university
records of enduring value. The
Archives serves as the corp .
memory of the university and pro-
vides a central source of informa-
tion about university departments,
people, events and ‘buildings. The
purpose of preserving historical
records in the Archives is to make
them useful to the faculty and staff
of the university and available to
scholars. L

After preservation, information
is the important function of the
University Archives.

KENT TEKULVE

Like most people, Kent Tekulve, pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates’
baseball organization,‘ first moved to Pittsburgh because he worked
here. - '

“Pittsburgh basically became my home, in 1975 because that was
the year I made the _team. But it has grown into more than a place to
work overthe last few years. It has become my home,” said Tekulve.

Tekulve believes that the reasons he feels at home in the Steel City
are simple ones. . . V *

“People come no friendlierthan Pittsburghers,” he said.

According to Tekulve, familiarity with the weather makes living
here easier. “Since I’m from another river city, Cincinnati, I also feel

comfortable with the climate.”

Money And College Sports: They Don’t

“Thanks, Phil.”

“Having the school pay for your

bucks in the pros.

Learning? What learning? As far
as I’m concerned, it’s just going to

suit, study or sport as a pastime
rather than a profession." At one
time, most college athletes were
strictly amateurs, but things have
changed. Today, big-time, Div-
ision 1 college sports enthusiasts

focus their minds on something‘

more than fun or pastime—money.

Whom do we have to thank for
changing the American definition
of the amateur?-—The money-
hungry college racketeers again.

But just who are these profit-
seeking tyrants who are set upon
demoralizing a school team’s
spirit? Professional franchise
owners andacoaches are the most
obvious, because they supply col-
lege athletes with the captivating
offers. However, there are others
who are also very much to blame

‘ for laying the groundwork of.the
corruption process. These other are

not so noticeable, since they are
often hidden within the
institutions.

One prime example of a college’s
big-money advocates are the
alumni booster clubs. The Aggie
Club of Texas A8CfVl-(Wl1O was
responsible for the departure of
Jackie Sherrill) pumps enough
money into‘ their football program
to make the GNP of most Third
World nations appear minature.
Sherrill’s m'ulti-million-dollar
contract is the result of a highly
sophisticated plan to develop
Texas A8cM into a football dynasty.

Having booster clubs such as the
Aggie Club has turned sports into a
competitive business.

We as fans are also at fault for the

television contract partially illus-
trate what the NCAA basketball
games have become,‘the large sums
of money paid to the tournament
participants—well over $1 million
to those who successfully advance
to the Final Four—are even more
telling.

Consider that the money earned
by those who reach the Final Four
is sufficient to pay the salaries of
the entire athletic department.

crave the best, the perfect, the ulti-

cumstances. Unfortunately, I think

tactic—legal or otherwise—to

reach the Promised Land.

It was only fitting, then, that
Notre Dame coach Digger Phelps,
whose team finished the season
with a 7-19 record, strutted into
New Orleans on the eve of the
semifinals and stole some of the
thunder. He told the conglomerate
of media types that some universi-
ties pay top-flight freshman pros-

I’

‘O

pects for four years of service in the
form of season tickets, cash and
other untraceable enticements.

Tell us something we didn't
know, Digger? What, you say that
some guards go for $10,000 a year?
Then those who suspect thatsome
top-notch collegiate football quar-
terbacks and running backs earn
$25,000 a year may be close to the
truth.

That figure is equivalent to over
$30,000 in taxed income, which is
above the NFL minimum pay
scale, meaning that if the rumors
are accurate, some college players
are making more money than their
professional counterparts.
Interesting.

Here a question must be raised:
should college-athletes receive pay-
ment for their services? The purists
who revere amateunism argue that

the appeal of collegiate sports— _

athletes competing for the sake of
competition itself——-would be
forever lost, turning the game into
a mockery of the NFL, with ‘its
emphasis on playing for pay.’

Well, it seems that the ethical

side has been neglected for quite L

some time‘. It’s difficult to call col-
legiate sports clean competition
and ignore the business aspect,
when 17 of the 250 NCAA member
schools are currently on probation,
most for recruiting violations. No
doubt this reflects the fact that,
winning for some, has replaced
competing as the collegiate ideal.

And there was the case of Rick
Kuhn, the former Boston College
basketball player who was found
guilty of shaving points in some
games. Kuhn was boughtout by
some chalk players—-more com-
monly called gamblers--who

Big money in college athletics,
and all of its accompanying nega-
tive aspects, are here to stay. The
owners and coaches, the alumni
boosters and even — we ourselves

asked for the upheaval of the colle- '

giate amateur’s attitude..

needed some insurance that Boston
College wouldn’t win by more
than seven points.

The mere fact that millions of
dollars were bet on the NCAA
final, and that billions more were
risked on other events throughout
the year, places collegiate sports in
the same frame as the profession-
als. Sure, 98 percent of the players
and coaches are innocent, but the
guilty two percent and the outside
gamblers violate the rules of clean

' competition and dirty the face of

collegiate sports.

It may sound farfetched, but why
not pay college athletes? After all,

their talents give a university pres- i

tige. In the cases of the NCAA bas-
ketball tournament and the
football bowl games, athletes also

bring schools considerable

Sure, the athletes are compen-

sated with an education, but for

A some, if not many, the education is ,

worthless since they may concen-
trate more on improving athletic
skills than on learning.

Each university could set up a
committee to decide how much a
given athlete is worth, while the
"NCAA sets a maximum salary

level. Players would receive pay- L

checks and pay taxes like every
other university employee.

Naturally, this isn't a cure,‘-all‘

solution, but it might reduce the
suspicions and bad images asso-

NFL Meet The USFL

_By KEVIN TURRENTINE

As if seven months of profes-
sional baseball weren't enough,
we now face a l0-month foot-
ball season.

Starting July 15 ‘ football
entersa new age with the insti-
tution of the United States
Football League(USFL). The
Super Bowl will no longer end
the season, but instead will
mark its midpoint.

The United States Football
League blossomed under the
watchful eye of David F. Dixon,
a New Orleans attorney who
started the wheels rolling for
the USFL 17 years ago. At that
time, attendance dictated the
formation of another league;
NFL stadiums. were jammed

_every Sunday afternoon. Nowa-
days, with the current ticket pri-
ces, the only hope
members of the population
have of getting intoa stadium is ,
if they work for the team. The
USFL will offer tickets atiprices
between $3 and $11. -

The USFL will be the firs
league. to present all of its games
on cable television. The league
has also signed a contract to tel-
evise games on ABC television.

Unlike‘ the defunct World
Football league, the USF L will
not be competing with the NFL
forfans. Bill Daniels, owner of
the new San Diego franchise,
said recent polls indicate that
85% of NFL viewers will watch
the USFL games.

The structure has been
derived from that of the NFL.
The season is scheduled to last
for 20 games, culminating with
a championship game on July
4. No name has been suggested
yet, but the possibilities range
from “American Bowl" to
“United States Bow_l.”

The costs of instituting the
new league are not ‘as high as
one might expect. A $40,000
start-up fee is required, along
with a credit line of $1 .5 million
and a 36 million commitment.

some" t

to back the league in its early
years.

Revenues could exceed $1.5
million in the first year of the
league’s existence, rising to $4
million the following year, and
eventually shooting to $15 mil-
lion in four years, Daniels said.

The first season will be the
test for the USFL. In the
absence of head-to-head compe-

tition with the NFL, the door "

would be open for a season last-
ing from March to July. Promo-
tional ideas for the new league
are budgeted at $500,000 per
team,‘ Also, the possibility of
scholarships and career-
placement programs for players
and their families are in the
making. ,

The most important clause in
the USFL plan is_ the ceiling
price of the payroll. The maxi-
mum payroll cost is currently
set at $1.2 to $2 million. The
possibility of an NFL player
strike on July 15 looms larger
and larger every day in part due
to the lack of a similar ceiling
clause.

Currently, the fanchise sites
are slated for 12 cities, all of
which are prime market. The
club sites and owners are:

0 San Diego—Bill Daniels,
the man generally considered
the father of cable .television
and business owner 6f the firm
Daniels and Associates in
Denver, Colorado;

0 New York-—Walter Dun-
can Jr., an Oklahoma City oil
tycoon; — ,

0 Boston-—Randy Vataha,
former NFL wide receiver for
the New England Patriots and
the Green Bay Packers and pres-
ident of LMV Inc., a company
which owns and manages
recreational facilities in the
northeastern United States. His
partner is George Matthews,
board chairman of Nuclear
Metals Inc.;

0 Birmingham-Marvin L. »

Warner, a Cincinnati native,
former Ambassador to Switzer-

4:4-

land and current president of
Combanks Inc. and Great
American Banks of Cincinnati;

0 Detroit—owner Alfred
Taubaum, president of Tau-
baum Inc. He will be a co-
owner with former Michigan
circuit judge Peter B. Spivak

O Denver—Ron Blanding
who also owns a real-estate
development and construction

‘company;

0 Tampa Bay—John Bassett,
president of Amulet Pictures,
Ltd., and one-time owner of the.
World Football League’s Mem-
phis Southmen and two teams
in the ancient World Hockey
Association. His partner will be
Steve Arky, a senior partner in a
Miami law firm;

0 Los Angeles-—'Jim S.
Joseph, president of Interland.

Corporation in San Mateo, Ca;
0 Philadelphia—Myles H.
Tannenbaum from King of
Prussia, Pa. and executive vice
president of Kravo Inc. -

0 San Francisco-owner
Thaddeus N. Taube, chairman
of Taube Associates Inc., a real
estate development and man-
agement company. i

0 Washington——owner Berl
Bernhard, president of a
Washington law firm.

0 Chicago—owner David, F.
Dixon, the father of the United
States Football League.

At first, the USFL will
initiate a territorial draft of col-
legiate players. For example,
the New York club owner is

. from Oklahoma. That club will
then be able to draft players
from the University of Okla-
horna_.-Tl1e league vows to

honor all professional contracts
and refuses to take collegiate
hardship cases, which adds
further credibility to the league.‘

The club owners can pick
from a list of 35 men to appoint
coaches. The 'list includes .
former NFL coaches and some
collegiate coaches.

The possibilities for the
USFL are endless. Eventually,
it may end up as a minor league
system for the NFL. NFL play- ' A
ers on an injured reserve list or a
player remaining on waivers

‘ may play ongan affiliate team in

the USFL.

Right now, the Uifited States 

Football League is set, and here
to stay. Who knows? If the NFL
strike becomes reality, the only
professional football on televi-
sion may be the United States
Football League. Now that's a
thought. '

World Boxing Council Hea
bout against Jerry Cooney

vyweighi Champion Larry Holmes prepares for his title

By BARRY ZASLOFF

his being called: The Pride ver-
sus The Glory, and much, much
more.

It it a hard-hitting champion
from Philadelphia squaring-off
against a rugged challenger from
New York, and much more.

It is the upcoming WBC title
’ fight between Larry ‘Holmes and
Gerry Cooney, and more.

It is Larry Holmes, who many
feel cannot withstand a solid
punch, facing a head-knocking
opponent. It is Cooney, believed to
‘ be untested in matches of this sort,
-slugging it out with the champion.
Unfortunately, it is still more.

In plain black and white, the
public, the media and the fighers
themselves have turned the fight
into just that—the black champion
versus the white challenger. It has
become Larry Holmes, the man
standing atop the boxing world,
defending his title as well as the
black myth of superiority inside
the squared ring, against Gerry
Cooney, the Great White Hope and
the one man deemed capable of
ending the long string of black
champions. Cooney has become
the fourth. coming of Rocky
Balboa. ‘

Even though this fight has the
potential to be the best of its kind in
the history of the sport, there is a
large group of people viewing the
match through a shaded pair of
J, glasses. They see only black and
white.

Holmes hasn't helped matters.

He calls Cooney the “Great White
Dope” and‘adds that Cooney was
chosen to fight him for _o e,
reason—he is white and the b A
office prospers from white fighters.
Cooney provided some solace by
asking: “What's my color have to
do with anything.

It would be nice, but perhaps a
little too naive, to expect the*spec-
tators to watch the match for what
it should l)e-——a great champion-
ship fight. But, as reality sets in
there is a nagging feeling that
many of the onlookers will be split
into two distinct groups—the
blacks rooting for the myth and the
whites for the Great Hope. While
most willdeny any allegiance, the
subconscious can be hard to
control,

The scenario is not too different
from that of Americans watching
the Olympic games. The fact that
the best athletes in the world are
performing plays second fiddle to
the matchup between the United
States and the Soviet Union. "Beat
those Ruskies!" is the cry that goes
out from more than one living
room in America.

The U.S. hockey team’s startling

upset in the 1980 Olympics was ‘

turned into a victory of America
over Russia, rather than a vi(:lory of
one group of athletes over another.

If Cooney defeats Holmes, it will ,
be a victory colored white.-~-fﬁ >

Holmes wins. it will be another A
white hope to bite the dust against
a black champion. Vb ‘

Either way, it is much more than
just a boxing match.

By KEVIN TURRENTINE
- When a homerun is hit or a
touchdown or a goal scored, the
tribute is payed to the deserving
athlete, the cult-like figure who has
the privelege of calling a sport “my
job.” Yet, we all know that these
so-called “stars” are merely child-
‘ren who found the perfect escape
from the nine-to-five syndrome.

Others are not as fortunate. The
frustration of the daily, tedious
routine must be relieved through

e outlet, some form of expres-

ii on. Needless to say, the sporting

event is the escape.

So rather than a grandiose accla-
mation of the over-paid, multi-
talented sportsman, this is a tribute
to the 200 million sports fans in
America.

The word “fan” is derived from
the word “fanatic,” an enthusiastic
devotee. Thus, a sports fan is one
enthusiastically devoted to sports.

Ah, but wait. There is a catch. In
order to be a sports fan, one must
stretch to unparalleled lengths,
sink to unforeseen lows and toler-

te uncountable years of losing.

When I first became a sports fan,
no one told me that losing is more
prominent than winning. It took
years before I realized that when a
team is losing theathletes on that
team- still get paid. The fan, how-
ever, must relinquish not only his
money. but his pride.

10 of the last 14 games with a
potent hitting attack average-wise

‘  that rarely hits at the right

"e, and a pitching staff that hasa
higher earned run average than
anyone else in the national league.

During the losing streak, the
Pirates have been playing at a .333
clip. If _the Pirates continued this
way for the rest of the 1982 season,
they would end up with a 60-102
record, a record comparable to that
of the 1952 Piiate team,tconsidered
to be one of the worst squads that
ever trotted onto a baseball dia-
mond, losing ll0..games.

Want some more statistics?Look
at the records of the starting
pitchers. No one has an ERA under
3.50, and the supposed ace of the
staff, Rick Rhodeﬁ, is 2-5, giving

seven runs per nine innings.
T e top pitcher on the squad, Don
Robinson, has an ERA of 4.87. Not
even the old “Lumber Company,
let alone "Murder's Row," could
score five or more runs every game.

Another problem with the star-
ters is the lack of games completed
by the staff. Until Robinson went
the distance against the Dodgers
last week, not one pitcher had
pitched a complete game. Also, in
25 games, no starter lasted past the
sixth inning. The bullpen may sue
for mistreatment. Tanner, who has
been called "Captain Hook" for
his quick removal of his starters,

The Chicago Club fans have suf-
fered for 46 years (when the Cubs
last won the pennant). butyet they
are true believers that one ofthese
centuries, the Cubs will win it all.
The only comparison to the Cub
fans are the children of Northern
Ireland———they just don't know any
other way of life. '

In all, baseball fans are rather
calm. They surrender two to three
hours a day to be entertained by a
small sphere flying in the air.

Patience is the key to being a
baseball fan, with a rain delay
being greatest. Who in his right
mind would pay seven bucks only
to be rained on while the athletes
he came to watch sat protected in a
dugout? The baseballcfan, that’s
who. 0

The basketball fan is more vocal
than the baseball fan, but he still
manages to retain his dignity. It’s
inspiring. to watch ten abnormally
large human beings challenge each
other’s jumping ability. It causes
even the shortest of fans to see him-
self doing a three-and-one-half
gainer while slamming a basket-
ball through a hoop.

The most deserving of basketball
fans must be the Philadelphia 76er
fans. After reaching the pinacle of
all basketball during the regular
season, only to lose in the playoffs,
the 76ers annually promise. their
fans, “we owe you one!” Rev.
Moon doesn’t owe half as much to

owe their fans.

What_ can be said about football
fans that hasn’t already been said?
Well, I’ll tell you...They’re crazier
than the players!

Football fans make mailmen
look hesitant to brave the weather.
The ability to sit frozen in a snow
storm, soaked in a rain storm or
roasted in the late summer sun is
what makes the football fan, well,
idiotic.

From such rousing cheers as’
“first and ten, do it again” to “kick
him in the left knee, kick him in the,
right knee, kick him in ...we need a
touchdown" is read the true
makeup of the football fan.,Not
only are they diehards, but they
must be musically inclined as well-.
Nowith‘at’s talent. ‘

Finally, the hockey fan. No other
fan becomes more attached to a
game. More criticism has befallen
the hockey fan than any the fan of
other sport. It's been said that if
fighting were outlawed in hockey,
the fans wouldn't even show up for
a game. Evidently, someone has
terrific hindsight. P»

For all those games, for all those
tickets, for all those player strikes,
for all those unstoppable foul balls
or strays pucks, for all those last-
second "losses, for all those losing
seasons...sports fans, this Bud’s for
you! ‘ ‘

umbling Out Of Pennant Race P

Tekulve, despite his poor perfor-
mance Monday, has returned to the
form that made him one of the top
firemen a couple years back.
Scurry, despite problems getting
his curve ball over the plate, has
been a perfect compliment to
Tanner’s righty-lefty philosophy,
and Manny Sarmiento has pitched
so well it makes one wonder why
the Pirates kept Tom Griffin.

Still, a pennant-contending
team can’t depend on'old cast-offs
from his opponents. Griffin, Paul
Moskau, Randy Niemann and
Ross Baumgarten were acquired by
the Pirates either by the waiver list
or in deals in which the Bucs traded
a marginal major-league prosp‘ect.
A winning team cannot depend on
this method of finding pitchers to
build a strong staff.

Although the Pirates are hitting
the ball well, there are some prob-
lems. ,Quite'simply, they'are not
getting the timely hitting necessary
to win games. " '

Case in point: Last Wednesday
against the Dodgers in Los

Angeles. 'l'herewere runners on
second and third with one out and
Dale Berra at the plate. Berra hits a
dribler that goes 40 feet. Runners
hold. A fly ball later, the Dodgers
are out of the inning. Los Angeles
wins the game 3-2. .
Another casezi Monday» night
against the Dodgers at Three”Riv-
ers Stadium, after jason Thomp-
son hit a home run to cut the lead to
*5-4, Los Angeles right fielder Jorge
Orga drops two. fly balls, and
coupled with a walk to Willie
Montanez, the bases were loaded.
The sentimental favorite, Willie
Stargell, comes up to his usual
loud ovation from the
throng. Stargell cranks up the bat
enough to generate a fly ball to cen-
ter field to end the inning. Final
Score: Los Angeles 5, Pittsburgh 4.
Conclusion: The Pirates muist
burn the deadwood that has
accumulated. Stargell, despite
being a class guy and a future Hall-
of-Famer, has seen better -days.
Berra has not been half the player
his dad was, and good-fielding,

small _

.200 hitting
plentiful.

Injuries, are taking- their toll on
the Pirates, as on ‘any other team.
The. only difference is that the re-
moval of a couple players may
mortally wound the Bucs. Third
Basemen Bill Madlock’s back,
injured in a game against Cincin-
nati, will heal only with rest,
though the absence of Madlock’s
bat cannot help the Pirates’ woes.

Omar Moreno is fighting off a
virus, and Tanner says that the cen-
terfielder is one player the Pirates
can’t afford to lose. And of course,
Dave Parker's wrist injury has
hampered the lineup.

Are there any solutions? Usually
people would ‘yell out, “Let the
young kids in the minors play.”

shortstops a re

However, the Pirate farm system, V

once a fertile oasis of talent, has
become a barren desert, thanks to
trades by Harding Peterson.
Going the trade route? Maybe,
but not likely. First of all, what
team is going to want last-place
talent. Surely the Pirates wouldn't

lineup this season.

trade Jason Thompson, Johnny

‘ Ray, Tony Pena or» Madlock.

Second, what is available? Yan-
kee shortstop Bucky Dent is availa-
ble, but the Pirates believe they

would be better off going with» '

Berrajor if they finally give upon
him, jimmy Smith. As for helping
out his pitching staff by trading off
some hitting, Tanner turns down
the idea. A , '

The answer may. be playing with
what they have and praying that
some of’ the question marks and
disappointments will start to pay.
off dividends.

Whatever Tanner, Peterson and
company decide, the change must

\provide instant results.,,As Tanner
said, “If you’re in a rainstorm,
you’ve got to keep driving until
you see sunshine.”

Tanner also said that if the team.
played the second third like it
played the first third, “it's going to
be a long, hard season." '

And the rainstorm will turn into

.a monsoon over Three Rivers
Stadium.

Speaking of Three Rivers Sta-
dium, the Pirates gave out baseball
caps last Sunday. Unlike past pro-
motions in which only those 14
and under received the prize, all
who attended the game got caps.
But /only l5,000 attended which
prompted one Pirate official to
suggest having another Cap Day
using the 40,000 leftover hats.
Maybe the poor turnout was due to
the commercials that had Berra
sewing the caps together.

Since Memorial Day usually
provides a large crowd, and the
Dodgers, one of the permier attrac-
tions in the major leagues, were in
town, the figures were very disap-
pointingto Pirate officials.

There are many“reasons for the
lack of attendance at Pirates games,;
and they have been mentioned a’
thousand times on talk shows and
newspapers. There is one sure-fire
promotion that will bring people
to the stadium, no matter how poor
the economy is treating the area or
how bad the parking and traffic;
situation is.

The well-known formula is win-

‘ P ning baseball.

Pirates Moving T oNew Orleans?

?-

By KEVIN TURRENTINE

The quality of a sports writer is
not determined entirely by his abil-
ity to recount past events, but also
by his ability to predict the course
of the future.‘The accuracy of a
prediction is the “make or break”
of a sports writer. Thus, the follow-

‘‘ ing predictions are based on hours

of research, countless interviews,
unending compilation of statistics
and the flip of a coin.

O Gato Del Sol will run in the
Belmont Stakes under an assumed
name: Ruffian. The move will be
simply for nostalgic’ reasons and

. possibly to raise the odds of the

race.

I The Los Angeles Lakers will
win ’ the NBA Championship,
which will entice Ralph Sampson
to declare hardship. Since the Lak-
ers planbn buying the first-round
pick from the.San-Diego Clippers,

' Sampson will assume his role next
season along side Kareem Abdul.
Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes, Magic
Johnson and Norm Nixon.

0 If the above prediction is true,
then the Lakers will win the NBA

title each year until 2013. That’s
the year the league will fold.

O The new United States Foot-
ball league will submit a new team.
The team will be owned by Presi-
dent Reagan and named the
Washington Welfares. They will
win two consecutive titles but no
one will be able to afford the ticket
price. i

O The NFL players will go on
strike July 15 forcing baseball sea-
son to be lengthened by three
months.

0 The Pirates will be moved to

New Orleans at the end of the 1982-
season. Then they will be moved to

Denver at the end of the 1983 sea-
son. They will return to Pittsburgh
at the end of the IQ84 season, and
no one will have missed‘ tlfem.

O The Pirates will finish in first
place ’ by the end of the season.
Attendance will be up 70 percent.
Jason Thompson will win the ‘bat-
ting crown, and Willie Stargell
will refuse to retire.

0 Jerry Cooney and Larry
Holmes will bypass the heavy-
weight title .bout and become a tag

team wrestling duo, named salt
and pepper. 0

O The Pitt football team will”,;§5§:-;‘

undefeated in l982, win the
national championship and be
added to the United States football
league as an expansion team.

0 In place of the Cooney—Holmes
fight, Caesar’s Palace has sche-
duled Pat Rice and Paul Baxter to a
ten-round bout.

0 The U.S. Open will be won by
an unknown this year, Dan
Marino. Dan has been warming up
all summer by participating in
numerous Foge Fazio golf-a-thons.

O Pitt will get rnopped up in the
Big East and the team will be dis-
banned in order to make room for a
new team on campus, women’s
softball. ’

0 Pittsburgh will get their lon  ,

awaited NBA franchise, but they
will have to find as better name
than the Pittsburgh 76ers‘.

O This years Wimbeldon tourna-
ment will ‘be held in Sweden in
order to entice Bjorn Borg to com-
petewfor the British title.

Their young faces express both
hope and fear. Hope that some-

’ how they’ll get enough food to
survive. Fearthat, like
millionsgof. children around the
world, they'll keep going to bed
hungry, fall ill and die from
the effects of malnutrition.

I Through CARE, you can feed
such hungry children, and
enable poor families to grow
more, food themselves. ‘

I You can heal the sick and
train local doctors and
nurses to save’many more
in the future.

I You can equip and teach
