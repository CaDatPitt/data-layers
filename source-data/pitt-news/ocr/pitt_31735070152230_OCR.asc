A Pitt pharmaceutical researcher charged with
obtaining prescription drugs using federal
grants and University funds waived his right
to apreliminary hearing Wednesday morning.
Pitt police charged Billy Day, 52, aprofessor
in the School of Pharmacy, on Sept. 25, 2013,
with 18 counts of obtaining prescription drugs
by fraud. The September 2013 complaint re-
ported Day’s alleged possession of narcotics
including midazolam, Demerol, clonazepam
and lorazepam, among others. The complaint
said Day recreationally injected the drugs.

Mike Manko,a spokesmanforthe A]1egh- P V

eny County District Attomey’s Ofﬁce, said in
an email that Day is not in custody and that
he “will be formally arraigned within 45 days,
at which time a judge will be assigned to the
case.” '

Accordingto Ken Service, Pitt’s vice chan-
cellor for communications, Day is on a leave of
absence from the University. Service declined
to comment on whether Day’s leave is paid or
unpaid, as “it is apersonnel matter.”

Service said the University has not made
any policy changes within the School of Phar-
macy since the criminal charges were ﬁled
against Day.

Phillippe Melograne, Day’s attorney, could
notbe reached after multiple requests for com-
ment. I '

Students   push for eliminationof Saturday ﬁnals

According to one University admin-
istrator, the elimination of Saturday
ﬁnals is impossible, but two students
have compiled research and met with
administrators in an attempt to tackle
the challenge. ' t .
Student Government Board Presi-

. ‘dent Mike Nites and Lauren Barney, a

junior majoring in Chinese and—politi-
cal science, have prepared a presenta-
tion that includes a sample final exam
schedule Nites created and information
regarding the ways in which other uni-

campaigned on a platform advocating
the removal of Saturday ﬁnals during
the 2013 Student Government Board
election. .

Barney said she and Nites met with
Daniel Stump, Pitt’s manager of course
and class scheduling, several times.
They have also “probed a little deeper’?
by contacting other administrators and
departments throughout the University.

__“We’ve taken it from a broad scope
and a narrow scope,” Barney said.
“We’re trying to look at all different
facets and all different angles of how
ﬁnals are scheduled.”

The process

Blocking out ﬁnal exam schedules is
a complicated endeavor. The University
Registrar’s Classroom Scheduling Ofﬁce
incorporates the individual schedules
of more than 18,000 undergraduates
to avoid overbooking students during
an already stressful week.

Stump has planned ﬁnal exam sched-
ules for the past two years.

The Registrar’s Ofﬁce designates

hourly ﬁnals, Stump said, depending,

on a class’s regular meeting time. For

instance, all classes —- besides those
scheduled for departmental ﬁnals —
that regularly meet at 8:00 a.m. on
Mondays will hold their ﬁnal exams
on Wednesday of Finals Week from 4
to 5:50 p.m. ‘

The Registrar’s Ofﬁce schedules ﬁnal
exam datesgwithin a basic grid related
to the class schedule, blocked off in
increments of 50 minutes from 8 a.m.

. to 5:50 p.m.

“We only have so many blocks in
that grid that can work,” Stump said.
“That’s why we have a Saturday final
—— it’s just not possible to remove the
Saturday ﬁnals.”

The Classroom Scheduling Ofﬁce
started planning ﬁnal exam dates for
the 2014 fall semester at the end of
the 2013 fall semester, and the office
obtains course information from Uni-
versity academic departments who
compile a course catalog.

Stump said that once the catalog
reaches completion, each department
must share its plans for offering ﬁnal
exams in its courses with the registrar,
The ofﬁce then develops a list of classes
that will proctor ﬁnals before or during
ﬁnals week.

Stump said a department’s choice
to require a departmental ﬁnal —— a

single exam given to multiple sections
of the same course that is taken simul-
taneously, regardless of each section’s
typical meeting time — or an hourly
ﬁnal — an exam schedule according
to the time a class meets — determines
the time slots for the exams. _. ‘
Other systems .
Depending upon the university, the
approach to ﬁnals week differs.
Barney and Nites researched the
scheduling systems at other universi-
ties — including schools in the Atlantic
Coast Conference, such as the Univer-
sity of North Carolina and Clemson Uni-
versity, as well as Temple University
and Penn State University, two other
Pennsylvania state-related universities
—- to ﬁnd a more ideal system for Pitt.
UNC.also struggles with complica-
tions surrounding Saturday exams.
“We’ve sort of gone back—andj-forth

on that,” Christopher Derickson, assis— '

ta‘nt provost and university registrar at
UNC’s Chapel Hill campus, said.
_ The university’s fall semester ﬁnals

_' ran from Monday to Monday. The uni-

versity also instituted re_ad-ing days,
or days that are reserved for studying

C without scheduled exams or c1asses,'on

Wednesday and Saturday during ﬁnals

days.

Derickson, who also chairs UNC-
Chapel Hill’s Academic Calendar Com-
mittee, which arranges finals. exam
dates each semester, said students’
choices between a reading day versus
a Saturday ﬁnal could alter‘their term’s
end date. Three students have served on
the committee, according to Derickson.

“They’ve chosen to have either a
reading day or ﬁnal exams on Satur-
days, so that we can actually_end the
semester a day earlier,” he said.

Departmental exams

' '- Nites said he, Barney and the Regis-
trar’s Ofﬁce were aware of a collective
issue surrounding the growing number
of departmental exams assigned during
ﬁnals week. ,

Nites and Barney studied the process

UNC implemented forcourses wishing _

to turn their hourly ﬁhal exams, into

ent their claim before the Academic
Advising Committee, which includes
the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce. The
committee would ultimately decide ifa
common hour exam is necessary.

UN,C’s Academic Advising Commit-
tee accounts for factors such as class
size. Partridge described how a mathe-
matics class interested in transitioning
to a common hour exam had to reach
certain size requirements before mov-
ing to a common exam time slot during
the spring term.

When deciding whether a course
should be approved for a common hour
exam, Partridge said the committee
deliberates based on need.

“Does the department need to have
this exam? Is it beneﬁcial to the stu-
dents‘? At the end of the day, that’s the
question. We’re not here to make the life
of the faculty necessarily easier. We’re
here to improve the service that we pro-
vide to the students,” Partridge said.

Partridge said he would recommend
the committee approval system.

“It helps keep our sections clean in
the common hour exam,” he said. “I
know that these [common hour exams]
need to be done this way.”

That is deﬁnitely one thing We’re trying
to do, though.” 1

Barney said Pitt does not have re-
quirements specifying how many stu-
dents have to be in a course for it to
qualify as a departmental ﬁnal. This

“We’re  here tomake the life of the

faculty necessarily easier. We’re here to

improve the service that we provide to the

students. ”

Christopher Partridge

According to Stump, Pitt’s Class-
room Scheduling Office is now inves-
tigating the process behind making an
exam departmental or hourly.

“We’re trying to come up with good
practice for the departmental exams 
Why is it done this way?” Stump said.
“Why are there so many departmentals
that may not have to be departmentals‘?

leads to departmental exam room as-
signments that are not necessarily size
effective or efﬁcient.

But even if the University Registrar’s
Classroom Scheduling Ofﬁce scheduled
departmental ﬁnals in appropriately
sized classrooms, departmental ﬁnals
are ﬁlling slots that could potentially
hold hourly exams.

Nites said a class such as General

Chemistry 1, which hosts around 1,200.

students from multiple sections, re-
quires a departmental ﬁnal to accom-
modate the large class size. Conversely,

if there are 150 students in a course '

taking a departmental ﬁnal, schedul-
ing may not be as efﬁcient, because the
class size does not necessarily require a
departmental time slot. The issue arises
when a low number of students in a_
single course are assigned a depart-
mental exam in a time slot that may
have allowed a number of courses —
and thus, more students — to take an
hourly exam.

But not everyone sees a need for
change.

Raymond Jones, a professor in the
business school, said he respects the
process Pitt uses to set up ﬁnals.

“The registrar has a really challeng-
ing job in scheduling ﬁnals,”Jones said.
“ [The registrar has] to schedule ﬁnals
for the entire University based on a
limited number of classrooms that are

available during the times when.stu—

dents‘ are available to take them.”

The "student push
"According to Barney, the elimina-

tion of Saturday finals could provide
a a critical competitive edge for Pitt’s

attractiveness to students.

Alexandra Savkova, a sophomore
majoring in pre—emergerfcy medicine
and prle-physician assistant, isone of
those students. Savkova was disap-

pointed to learn that her Organic .Chem— . _

° .

istry ﬁnal landed on Saturday during

the’2013 fall semester."

Savkova, who had ﬁnal exams be-
fore and during ﬁnals week in the fall
semester, said she isstrongly opposed
to Saturday finals. ~

“It seems likevthere are a lot of kids
who end up with three finals in one day
and ﬁnals on a_Saturday,” Savkova said.

Since 2010, studentswith more-than
two ‘exams on the same day during ﬁ-
nals week have had the opportunity to
submit _a Final Examination Conflict
Accommodation Request form with the
University Registrar’s Office.

According to Stump, the University
accommodation procedure can create
additional scheduling issues.

He said without the Saturday ﬁnals,
students would be more likely to have

' two ﬁnals scheduled for the samehay.

But for some students, even these

accommodations aren’t enough to sort

out the bu-rdens of ﬁnals week.

Savkova said she had to resched-
ule’ one of her three Monday exams to
Saturday. Since she was already sched-
uled to take one science—based exam on
Saturday, she had to take two science-
based exams that day, instead.

“Personally, I would not put anything
on a Saturday,” Savkova said. “I know
students don’t want totake a final on
a Saturday.”

Stump said eliminating Saturday‘ V

ﬁnals may lead to a dangerous trend. '

“Nobody wants Saturday ﬁnals, but
if we got rid of the Saturday ﬁnal, no-
body would want Friday ﬁnals,” he said.

Aﬂbrdable Care Act de-stigmatizes
mental illness, helping millions

Julia Carpey
Columnist

Schools across the country
have adopted and abided by
“zero tolerance” disciplinary
policies that grant students

' who commit anything from

acts of bullying and insubor-
dination to minor infractions
of school behavior codes the
maximum punishment of ei-
ther suspension or expulsion.

These wide—reaching poli-
cies have recently_been a topic
for review by school districts,
a reappraisal that has been
long overdue. Rehabilitating
student behavior must be the
focus of such disciplinary mea-

sures; using suspension and
expulsion policies as a disci-
plinary measure is unaccept-
able in an environment that
is meant to teach and foster
young minds.

Studies have shown that
suspending and expelling stu-
dents does nothing beneficial
for the student, but only im-
proves the well-being of the

‘school. While that is certainly

important, schools have an.ob-
ligation to provide students
with a quality education that
goes beyond what textbooks

, teach and exams evaluate.
. What is more, federal data is-

sued by the U.S. Department of
Education says minority stu-

dents — namely black students
and students with disabilities
— were targeted for these ex-
treme disciplinary actions.

In Allegheny County alone,
more than 30,000 out—of-
school suspensions were is-
sued to public school students
in kindergarten through 12th
grade in the 2011-2012 school
year. While Pittsburgh Public
Schools reduced the number
by about 30 percent between
the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013
school years, the number is
still astounding.

Instead of using such poli-
cies as a first line of defense

Jewish a capella group balances heritage, hits

Sam Bojarski
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

Singing is Sam Haberman-Chopp’s ﬁrst
love, so when she arrived on Pitt’s campus
her freshman year, she was looking to join
an a cappella group.

Beingjewish, she thought Vokols would
be the perfect ﬁt for her. Although the V0-
kols a cappella group is not formally affili-
ated with any religion, the vocal group has
had a distinctJewish identity since it ﬁrst
formed nearly eight years ago.

‘~ Although about 75 percent of Vokols’
repertoire consists of American pop songs,
the group also performs a select number of
older Hebrew songs.

The singers are also the only a capella
group in the city to perform at synagogues
and other Jewish events throughout the
city, which often garners them a “Jewish a

capella group” labelgon campus. _

Haberman—Chopp, Jenna Moen and
Kelsey DeAngelis, three of Vokols’ 18 mem-
bers, said the label is not enough to deﬁne
their dynamic vocal group.

“One thing that seriously separates us is
that we try to represent a minority popula-
tion in that we representjewish culture, but
we don’t represent Judaism as a religion,”
Haberman-Choppa senior Communica-
tions science and disorders major said.
“The majority of our group isn’t Jewish.
Even though they’re not Jewish, they still

love the culture of Judaism. So we try to T

portray that through our music and our
presence.”

Vokols began in September 2006 when
four members of the Hilleljewish University
Center decided to form an a capella group.
Although these four individuals were Jew-
ish, they did not intend to start an exclu-

sively Jewish group. They did, however,
see an afﬁliation with Hillel as a great way
to get gigs. W

“Being part of Hillel really has felt like

being part of a family,” Moen, a junior

sociology and non—ﬁction writing major
said. “The Jewish culture in Pittsburgh is
actually huge compared to other cities. But
just walking into Hillel, you see people you
know, and even not beingJ'ewish, they treat
me like part of their Hillel family and'ev—
erything.”

A question of religion isn’t even raised
when Vokols auditions new members, al-
though many Vokols hopefuls like to as-

. sert theirJewish identity during auditions

by singing Hebrew songs or striking up a
conversation about their religion — much
to the amusement of Haberman—Chopp
and company. °

“We got four new people this year, three

weren’t Jewish andone is, but we would
never accept a less talented person because
they are Jewish,” said Haberman—Chopp.

Nevertheless, many people on campus
still perceive Vokols as associated withJuda-
ism as a religion.

“The more we improve, the more they’ll
respect us for our talent and not the fact that
we’re the ‘Jewish a capella group,” DeAn-
gelis, a sophomore psychology major said.

While the group says there is nothing
wrong with the religion, a focus onjudaism

was never the intent of the group from the

onset, and it is not the identity the group
desires today.

. “We’re trying to erase the stigma, rather
than [form a] new image. Because there’s
nothing wrong with our image, it’s just the
way people perceive that image,” Haber-
man—Chopp said.

Meanwhile, public relations executives
were clamoring over this new distribu-
tion platform, and the question of how
to survive as an artist in a digital land-
scape that frankly isn’t good at paying
for things (see: Spotify) has intensiﬁed
lately as things continue to progress in
a dizzying fashion. If Beyoncé proved
anything, it’s that the album rollout is the
saving grace for paid content.

Musically, 2013 culminated with Be-
yoncé’s surprise release, but the year, as
a whole, was full of experiments on how
to navigate a ﬂeeting, impossibly critical
cultural landscape. _ ' « ‘

Miley Cyrus, conﬁdent in her online
controversy appeal, made a bet with L.A.
hit maker Lukas Gottwald (who is com-
monly referred to as Dr. Luke) that her
song “Wrecking Ball,” would top YouTube
charts — ‘she won.

Kanye West’s face adorned giant build-
ings throughout the world as he decried
being crowded out of the fashion industry
on “New Slaves.” Drake basically cried on
national television as he performed “Too
Much” onjimmy Fallon. Arcade Fire tried
to get people to dress up at their shows
but underestimated just how petty the
Internet can be and quickly rescinded
the dress code.

What all of these examples prove is
that engaging an audience as an artist in
the current state of the music industry
needs to somehow mimic the days before
the Internet. People need to want to own
something physically, or want to experi-
ence something that lasts longer than ﬁve
seconds. Otherwise, the artist probably
won’t get paid.

Beyoncé’s release will rightfully be

  lauded as an innovation in the industry,

but it wouldn’t be right to forget about
Childish Gambino. Donald Glover’s divi-

t sive side project, “Because the Internet,”

had the best (and probably most practi-
cal) rollout of the year.
A 76-page screenplay that requires less

patience than the words “76 pages” would
have you think accompanies “Because the
Internet.” The album’s focus is on how
ﬂeeting the times in which we live are.

While Beyoncé certainly has enough
cultural clout to pull off an unannounced
album, Gambino, who has it hard enough
with that name, truly went against the
grain. The screenplay features brief clips
directed by Glover that give the songs
on the record an unprecedented degree
of context.

Despite what reservations you might
have with Gambino’s music or image, he
understands how obsessed we all are with
context. Drake is interesting because of
how public his relationships are. Kanye
West will always captivate us with the
simple question of “What next?” And so
on. -
We live in a time where everything is
literally at our ﬁngertips, and as James
Franco. explains in his New York Times
piece about the selﬁe, artists have an en-
tirely new ability to add context to their
work. It just took a star as bright as Be-
yoncé to make them realize it. I

All hail the King of Trolls: Why Armond White matters

John Lavanga
/I€9°E Editor

In a 1911 interview with The New York
Times, Mark Twain remarked that the
critical reception of his novel “The
Prince and the Pauper” — which he
perceived as pigeonholing the book as
a simplistic comedy — “came mighty
near changing the entire course of [his]
literary life and incidentally gave [him]
a lifelong yearning to kill a critic.”

“I shall never die happy unless I have
at least scalped one,” he concluded.

Though the desire might be a bit ex-
treme, and the method may be a hair
antiquated, Twain’s hatred of critics is  1..
certainly not an isolated instance. Crit-
ics are divisive by occupation — it’s rare
that we meet someone who actually en-

poured endless hours of labor into is an
abject and utter failure. (Grade? Does
it even deserve one? Fine then. Half a
star. Fine. One Star.) Perhaps no one
encapsulates the hatred a critic can
inspire — or the importance of their

work —— better than City Arts editor ,

and ﬁlm critic Armond White.

Frequently ruthless and always con— i

trarian, White has developed an almost
legendary reputation as the film world’s
most incisive troll (long before we
called them trolls), viciously panning
ﬁlms that many of his peers laud as bril-
liant. Ifa movie has a 99 percent fresh
rating on Rotten Tomatoes, there’s a
good chance White was probably the
man standing in the way of a perfect
score (see: Toy Story 3). Over the past
several years, he’s trashed the Harry
Potter/ﬁlms (“the dullest franchise in
the history of movie franchises”), ‘.‘Mid-
night in Paris” (“a global degradation
of our culture standards”) and many

. others. As The A.V. Club’s Sean O’Neill

put it, White is “the man who uses his
breadth of ﬁlm knowledge to create the
most impressively researched versions
of ‘U mad bro?’ in the realm of movie
criticism.” . .

On Monday night, White made head-
lines yet again because of claims that
he heckled" director Steve McQueen -
whose film ‘‘12 Years a Slave” he dubbed
“torture -porn” akin to “The Human
Centipede” — at the New York Film
Critics Circle Awards, saying, among
other things, “f*** you” and calling Mc-
Queen a “garbageman” as the director
accepted the 2013 award for best di-
rector. Although White has denied the
accusations, they ﬁt all too well into
his image as the ﬁlm world’s proverbial
~— and perhaps now literal — heckler.

Whether or not the accusations
made against White are true — even
New Yorker writer David Denby claims
that he overheard some of the insults
lobbed —— the stories fit nicely into
the lore of White and have no doubt
made it even easier to hate the man
who might already be the film world’s
most hated critic. Since the story broke,
writers have been pointing to the inci-

Though there is certainly some
truth to this perspective, simply writ-
ing White and his contrarian perspec-

tive off as snide trolling overlooks the
value in White and the many writers
and critics who sometimes resemble
him. Though it’s difficult to agree with
most of White’s sentiments about nearly
any movie he happens to review, it isn’t
very difﬁcult to identify his qualms with
these films — in fact, he’s written them
all down in a review. S

— for a gleefully ﬁctitious account of how

leans on superﬁcial distractions to com-

In rounding up’ most all of his frequent
Hollywood collaborators, “American

party for Russell and friends. The hair!
The costumes! The ’7os microwaves! Our
attention is being wrongly pushed and
pulled away from the particulars of Ab-

ing stories to tell — he‘just can’t ﬁgure
out which one’s worth telling.

Perhaps what’s most fascinating about
“American Hustle” is that for the ﬁrst 20
minutes, it’s an engaging and tonally—
assured ﬁlm. When left to Bale, Adams
and their revealing shared narration of
the ﬁlm, “American Hustle” scratches the
surface of what makes these potentially

once Russell introduces more characters

“FOOTBALL

Kolodziej named new football strength and conditioning coach

~ 4» ' Nate Barnes

Sports Editor

Ross Kolodziej was named the Pitt foot-
ball strength and conditioning coach
Wednesday afternoon, according to a
press release from the football pro-
gram. Kolodziej replaces Todd Rice,
who resigned from the position Dec.
20, 2013. x '
“I’m honored to be given this respon-
sibility by coach Chryst,” Kolodziej said.

‘*"‘we have a sense of urgency to build

upon the momentum from our bowl
victory. That starts in the weight room
this winter.”

Like Chryst, Kolodziej is an alumnus
of the University of Wisconsin-, where he

started 45 games as a defensive tackle _

from'1997 to 2000. Kolodziej currently
holds records in the Badgers program
for a defensive player in the squat,

clean, 40-‘yard dash, vertical jump and
pro-agility drill. V
Chryst spoke highly of the selection.
1 ‘_‘The 2014 season starts on Thursday
when we begin our offseason training
program, and I’m excited that Ross will
be leading this very important area,”
Chryst said. “This is a well-earned op-
portunity for him and I know he is going
to make _a signiﬁcant impact.”
Kolodziej was drafted in the seventh
round of the 2001 NFL Draft by the New

~ York Giants and played seven seasons

in the NFL for the Giants, Minnesota
Vikings, San Francisco 49ers and Ari-
zona Cardinals. He started 14 games on
the Cardinals’ top-10 defense in 2005.

Kolodziej also spent two seasons in

the United Football League and cap-

tained the Las Vegas Locomotives teams
that won league championships in 2009
and 2010.

L Kolodziej’s hiring follows a season

in which Pitt dealt with a number of '

injuries that kept wide receiver Devin
Street, left tackle Adam Bisnowaty and
left guard Cory King out of action. On
the "offensive line, Bisnowatyand King
missed games because of back injuries.

At Wisconsin, Kolodziej was a°full-
time strength and conditioning intern

in the 2009 offseason. The next year, he»

worked with the Badgers as a defensive
graduate assistant. ‘
Kolodziej said that itis-the coaches’
responsibility to maximize players’
abilities and opportunities at Pitt.
“They may think they know what
work is, but we’re going to put them in
the furnace this offseason,” he said.“The
gre_at.thing is our kids have told me they

want to work and be pushed. It’s that °Kolodlziej spent seven years in the
kind of desire that produces results on NFL. Photo courtesy Pitt Athletics

I »-WORDS ‘OF WILSON

Time to letthe pastbethe past forMichae| Vick “

Jasper Wilson
Senior Staﬁ Wrz‘ter

On Monday, New York Times sports colum-
nistjuliet Macur wrote about Michael Vick.
_ Her doing so wasn’t odd, in and of "it-
self. The 33-year-old Philadelphia Eagles

. , quarterback is nearing a crossroads in his l

career, having been relegated to a backup
role in favor of the younger Nick Foles.
Vick, though, apparently feels he still has
something to offer as a starter for some
NFL team and so wants to move on.

«J What’s notable about Macur_’s piece is
the angle she takes.

The headline, “Before signing a strong
arm, teams should heed Vick’s dark past,”
is reasonable enough. Itmakes sense that
a potential employer would look closely at

-. someone who ran a multi-state dogﬁghting

syndicate, no matter the profession. Espe-

cially in the realm of professional sports,
when a_ slip-up by a player could cost an
employer millions of dollars and massive
amounts of negative publicity.

But then, after two introductory para-
graphs of setting thefscene, Macur say
something confusing. ‘

“Animal lovers everywhere can cheer
Vick’s departure from this city,” she writes.
“Especially those who have had to watch
him play here since 2009, less than three
months after he served time in a federal
prison for his role in a dogﬁghting ring.”

What? '

Oh, right, the despicable crime Vick
committed that happened more than six
and a half years ago. The offense for which
he served his time in prison (19 months
of a 23-month sentence) and has since,

by all accounts, stayed on the right side‘

of the law.

If this column was written in 2009
following Vick’s‘ release from prison and
the expiration of his suspension from the
league,'it would make more sense. Vick
was still one of the faces of the league then,
which made his misdeeds more newswor-
thy. But, as of Sunday, he was not even the
face of the team for which he plays.

“He stood like a spectator on the side-
line, looking helpless and anonymous in

‘a long black coat and an Eagles knit cap,”

Macur wrote.

All of what Vick allowed to happen and
engaged in with the dogﬁghting was hor-
rible, and Macur erases any possible doubt

, of that with her detailed descriptions in

the story. .

“In the backyard of his Virginia home
were mass graves of pit bulls that had
fought for him or had been torn apart serv-
ing as bait dogs in practice sessions. The

surviving dogs were found barely alive,
beaten, starved, tortured and chained to
concrete slabs,” she wrote. '

That’s just the first of ﬁve consecutive
paragraphs on the subject. It’s the most
powerful segment of the article, but it
shouldn’t have been included.

Back to Philadelphia fans “cheering.”
They can cheer when he leaves, but "will
they? ‘ l - .

Are Vick’s past actions still tormenting
animal loversjso much that the mere act of

j him leaving one team to potentially sign

with another in free agency is cause for

celebration? It doesn’t appear so. And if '

that’s the case, it’s devoid of logic.

It would be more constructive to move
on to addressing the issue of dogﬁghting
at present. Even better would be to shift

In sports, there are currently many ways

in which the democratic votingprocess
is poorly used. '

Look at the Associated Press Top 25,
or the much-maligned Coaches Poll in
college football. '

But worse than all of these is a system
that is not only broken, but catastrophic
to baseball, a game that has arguably the
best Hall of Fame in all of sports and is
considered “Ameri_c_a’s pastime” by his-
torians and sports writers, alike.

» Broken, because players such as Barry

»’Bonds, Mike Piazza, Mark McGwire and
. Sammy Sosa are not enshrined within

its walls.

, The .Major League Baseball Hall of

Fame dates back to 1936, the year the

4 museum welcomed its inaugural class,
which included fall”-time’ greats ’inc_lucling:

Babe Ruth, Walter Johnson‘, Ty Cobb,

Christy Mathewson and Honus Wagner.

Since 1936, a total of 306 players,
managers, writers, umpires, owners,
broadcasters and executives — includ-
ing 2014 elects Joe Torre, Tony La Russa,
Bobby Cox, Greg Maddux, Frank Thomas
and Tom Glavine — have been elécted._

And over the years, there have cer-
tainly been some memorable “snubs”
for various reasons. ‘

Whether it’s “Shoeless” Joe Jackson
or Pete Rose being banned from Hall
of Fame consideration due to the char-
acter clause of the Hall’s election rules

— which states players should be vote'd . .

in based on “record, playing ability, in-
tegrity, sportsmanship, character and
contribution — or guys likejack Morris,
Tim Raines, Piazza, Craig Biggio and Don
Mattingly. »

The “steroid era”, which lasted from .

1996 to 2011, has’forever‘taintec_l the per-
ception of players who played during that
time because of the widespread usage of
performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs.

As someone who grew up during that V

time, my first memories include the
home run race between McGwire. and
Sosa 4 both of whom were candidates
on this year’s ballot (Sosa received 41

’ votes, while’McGwire received 63); Pi-

azza’s home run in the ﬁrst game played ~

in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks,
and Bonds’ 756th home run in 2007.

i that energy toward the players who have

committed more serious offenses.

Donte Stallworth killed someone while
driving under the inﬂuence. He played for
three seasons after that. He’s a free agent
‘currently and the same age as Vick. Where
was this j ouma1ist’s plea to everyone after

. Washington cut him last summer? _
-The same goes for Adam “Pac Man”

Jones, who is an active member of the Cin-
cinnati Bengals and has been involved in
two shootings, one of which resulted in an
innocent bystander becoming paralyzed
from the waist down.
So, why Vick?

Macur has met his victims. In one of
those gripping paragraphs, she recounts
meeting a number of dogs rescued from
that hellish_ situation in 2008, referring
to them as “Vick Dogs.”

Is it possible that she has taken it upon '

herself to seek some sort of revenge on
Vick for his gross actions toward those
dogs? — .

It comes off that way.

“Teams ‘evaluating Vick should say,
‘Can’t we give our fans someone better to
cheer for?” she Writes.

Yes, of course they should. However, the
idea of people with power in the NFL car-

.ing about ethics and morality is a concept

based in fantasy. Such naive idealism, even
if meant as an ironic or rhetorical device
in the story, is misplaced by Macur, who
covers sports for a living and surely knows

as well as anyone how the NFL operates.

Indeed she does. _
“If you can throw a football, if you can

catch a football, if you can call plays that ‘

win big games, then nothing else matters,”
she writes.

Macur uses the missteps of Vick’s team-
mate Riley Cooper and those of New Or-
leans Saints head coach Sean Payton as a
way to frame Vick’s situation in the con-
text of’ the laissez-faire administration of

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, but it

doesn’t help her argument.

With that said, what she writes about
her subject isn’t solely negative.

Macur volunteers ways that Vick has

used his second chance to try to raise _

awareness of animal cruelty and educate
the public so that his mistakes are not re-
peated. ,

He has worked with the Humane So-
ciety of the United States since 2009 in
the hopes of stopping people from doing
what he did.

.He supported a national legislative bill
aimed at making the act of bringing a child
to a dogﬁght a felony, because he was ex-
posed to the activity at a young age ancL
credits that experience with the beginning
of his backwards understanding of what
dogs are for.

_ The Vick family now has a dog, which
they got in 2012 —- a privilege earned after
Vick completed his probation. V 1-

Yet it appears that all of this evidence
is not enough to convince Macur of Vick’s
change and urge the author to abandon
her vitriol. ~

Vick’s past is something to be forgiven, but not forgotten. MCT Campus

Q FROM PAGE 15

‘WILSON

“Signs of a changed man? Maybe,” she
writes. -

But, that’s not what’s important. She
has a solution. '

“But the Eagles should make it easy for
their fans. They should replace Vick with
someone devoid of a dark past, someone

who hasn’t been in_ prison for such a rep-
rehensible crime. It’s a pathetically low
bar, but it ought to be the bare minimum,”
she argues.

Uh, okay. - A

“Vick told me on Saturday that he had

grown up since serving time in prison and 7

had done a lot to redeem himself in the
eyes of the public.
“‘I’ve changed in so many ways, so many
— why don’t you write that?’ he toldpme.”
Forgive but don’t forget, Ms. Macur. E

nections to PEDs, the argument can and
should be made that these are two of the
best players of all time. ' ’

The best—hitting catcher of all time,
Piazza received just 355 votes (74 votes
short), while Craig Biggio, a member
of the 3,000-hit club and a player who
scored 100 runs in a seasoneight times
and stole 30 bases in a season five times,
missed being electedythisiyear by_,tw'o
votes. ll _  f ..  Z. 
In addition to Piazza and Biggio, Rog-
er Clemens 4 who totaled 4,672 career
strikeouts (which is the third—most of
all time), 354.career wins and seven Cy
Young Awards — and Bonds — who hit
762 career home runs (which is the most
of all time), totaled 2935 hits, maintained
a .298 career batting average and earned
a record seven MVP awards —— received
the same treatment.

While the six players listed above are

suspected of PED use, one thing cannot .

be denied: Bonds, Piazza, Biggio, Clem-
ens, Sosa and McGwire are among the
best players to ever play their respec-
tive positions, and as such, need to be
inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Back in 2008, I made my first and
.,only visit to Cooperstown, N.Y., to visit
the Baseball Hall of Fame. As I walked
up and down the halls of the hallowed
institution, a thought came to me: What
is the Hall of Fame going to look like in
10 years? How about 15 years, or even 20

years? Will Barry, Bonds make the Hall
5 of Fame?

In the six‘ years that have since passed,

- the picture is starting to become much
‘clearer. »

It was obvious last year when the writ-
ers failed to vote anyone into.the Hall of
Fame for just the third time since 1970,
due in large part to the ballots consist-
ing of mostly steroid—era players such
as Sosa, Bonds, Clemens, McGwire and
Piazza. -

When people discuss players like
Bonds and Sosa, they talk about putting
black marks on their plaques, or putting
asterisks in the record books. ’

OCC Credit
Baﬁ'e.°f the Panthers

 
 

But to me the answer is simple.

Make a special wing in the small,
three-floor museum in Cooperstown
where all of the players (whether there

were suspicions or not), who played in 9

the steroid era and get elected will be
mentioned.

This exhibit can include videos, dem-
onstrations and presentations not only

on the players’ careers, but also on PEDs -

and the dangers of using these drugs.
This way, some of the greatest players of
all time and of this generation can be fea-
tured in baseball’s most hallowed halls.

It needs to happen, not for the genera-
tion growing up now, but for the genera-
tion that is to come. They need to learn
about the greatest home run hitter of all
time, the best—hitti_ng catcher of all time
and even one of the best power pitchers
of all time. .

And as I look ahead toward 2015, 2016
and beyond, the 571 most scrutinized
people in America right now will prob-
ably make the right the decision and elect
almost all of the guys mentioned above.

But it’s going to take a long, long time.
