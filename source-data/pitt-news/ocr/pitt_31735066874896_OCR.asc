Float Event
Shifted To
Fall Game

By MANNY SILVERBLATT

Student Congress voted
Wednesday to shift the ﬂoat
parade from Spring Festival

xto Homecoming Week and

passed a unanimous decision to
back Druid’s ‘‘Block P” plan.

At abusy session, S.C. also re-
ceived a ﬁnancial uplift from the
men’s varsity debate team over
expenses and made plans to send
a co-ed to Southern Californialto
represent Pitt in the annual foot-
ball festival there preceding the
game to be held at Pitt Stadium.

S.C. agreed that shifting the
float parade for the Miami game
(in the fall would be an advan-
tage. It would occur Oct. 29, six
weeks after school starts. The
organizations w h i c h prepare
ﬂoats would have more time to
do so. At present, Spring Car-

nival and- the ﬂoat parade occur »

in‘the same week and little time
is allowed to prepare either ade-
quately.
This idea is still in its initial
state. The public relations com-
mittee are working out details.

—They expressed the’ hope that

ﬂoats will be able to be displayed
around the stadium during the
half. However, this must be ap-

A proved from varied sources includ-

ing the bank, and the Alumni As-

" sociation.

Druids Conﬁdent
Flashcards will once again be

’ attempted. Druids after an unsuc-

cessful try two years ago, feel con-
ﬁdent that “Block P” plan will be
successful this time. The section
of students that will display the
ﬂashcards in designs will consist
of 900 Pittites to co—ordinate the
various schemes and colorations.
Membership fee is twenty-ﬁve
cents. A mass meeting will be held
May 18, at 12:30 in the Lilly Court
at which time prospective mem-

_ bers may sign up. '

Shows Open Until 12:30 Tonight

News Reviewers
Find Most Plays
To Be Worthwhile

(Editor’s note: The following
reviews of the‘ Spring Festival
shows and booths were written by
Paul Harrison, Managing Editor,
Ed Bachman, News Editor and
Rosemarie Scarpiello, Senior Re-
porter.)

\ The States of the Union can
well be proud of the public
relations job done for them
in this year’s Pitt Spring Car-
nival. Carnival time is every-
one’s time, and the spirit and
mood of this year’s Festival must
certainly rank with the best Pitt
has had.

The effort and ingenuity put in-
to “Americarnival” this year, has
been rewarding. Pitt is gifted with
talent galore‘ and the evidence will
be displayed for the ﬁnal time this
year tonight from 6:30 p.m. until
12:30 a.m.

Summarizing “Americarnival” is
difﬁcult, but here are some of the
highlights as Pitt News reviewers
noted them:

Texas Tempo -— Well-balanced‘
curves throw the villian for a loop
in this fast-paced Texan tale. Bas-
ed on “High Noon,” this show
gives a good variety of songs, good
chorus lines, and a very- adequate
duet team. Chorus hits peak on
“I’m Just a Girl Who Can’t Say
No.” V —
(Kappa Nu and'Delta Zeta) .

California Conﬁdential-An all-
male cast puts this-show on a level
of its own. But the absence of the
gals isn’t minded a bit. Excellent
punch lines and gags make up for
a small number of songs in this
satire on Hollywood. Empty seats’
are hard to find, in this laugh-
loaded presentation. ”

“Melancholy Rhapsody.”

Pilgrim’s Progress — Even if
Miles didn’t getvery far, this show

 

certainly did. A fast moving per-
formance with excellent ’ dances,

comedy. Pilgrim women dancing
in a chorus line, advice from
“friendly”-witches who took the
Dale Carnegie course, and the di-
lemna of “The Reluctant Pilgrim”
all hold the audience’s attention
throughout this show which leaves
one pleasantly satisﬁed.

First ‘Omnibus’ Issue

Readied for May 27

JOAN THOMAS

An idea conceived last October will become a reality
on May 27, when the ﬁrst issue, a trial issue, of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Omnibus, Pitt’s ﬁrst student magazine pub-
lished in two years, hitsthe stands. The University Publi-
cation Board passed ,a motion to go ahead on the production
of Omnibus at their Apr. 27 meeting, the last of the year.

Jim DeWeese, present editorial advisor of the Pitt News,
presented a mock-up of the proposed magazine, and gave
the statement of editorial policy and plan for ﬁnance.

The "board cast only three descenting votes, out of the

23 members present. If the board:

authors and others who have ex-

novel lyrics and plenty of good

include “Man Behind the Plan,” a
complete feature on Dr. Fitzgerald,
retiring chancellor; “The Core’s
the Thing,” an informative feature
on the University’s new core cur.-
riculum to be initiated next fall;
“Union Means Student” an ex-
planation ‘of Pitt’s future Student
U n i o n, including architectural
plans and functions. _

“Arnie Runs So—Well,” a sketch
of Pitt’s star trackster; Arnie
Sowell; “It’s Debatable,” a feature
on this year’s debate team and its
outstanding record; and “Just An-
other Job,” an article on the polio
vaccine developed by Jonas Salk,
University researcher. .

Humor Subtle

Humor will be along the lines of
that carried by the Saturday Eve-
ning Post. Cartoons on University
life and the perfect «squelch, titled
“This is the end,” will be includ:
ed. Three pages of the mazagine
will be devoted to literary humor.

Discussions In

Alldred Room

The Alldred Room, (library
reading room located on the
sixth floor, will be the site
for anew faculty discussion
program which will be initiated on
a trial run next week. Interested I
faculty and administration mem-
bers will meet Thursday, May 19,
at 3:30 p.m. to join in on a dis-
cussion on the topic, “Religious .
ideas in modern ﬁction.”

A later program will concern
the same subject as it can be
View .in non-ﬁction writing.

Frederick P. Mayer, professor of
English, will introduce the topic at
Thursday’s meeting where he will
discuss the works of such authors
as Graham Green, Joyce Carey, C.
P. Snow, and. Sylvia Townsend
Warner. The introductory talk will
permit time for informal discus-
sion among those in attendance.

Special arrangements . have
been made to serve 'coﬁee in
the library room during the

. hour. '

Miss Helen F. Dice, Alldred
room librarian, is in the process of
gathering books by the named‘
pressed religious ideas. The dis-
cussion, however, will not be of
a religious nature. Itwill dwell on
the inﬂuences which religious
ideals have on modern literature,
according to Dr. Edna T. Batz,
YWCA executive director, who
originated the program along with
YMCA director, Al Louden.

Efforts for the discussion are be-
ing made to involve both long-«
term and new faculty members
who don’t often have the oppor-
tunity to meet together in informal
discussion, -

Although it is too late to com-
plete this year, the program, if
successful, would be extended
into a series beginning next se-
mester. Eventually, students will
be able toparticipate in the lit-
erary discussions. '

Miss Lorena A. Garloch, Uni-
versity librarian, has given full
support to the program in the
Alldred Room. S

Student Union Planners Want  
Suggestions From Undergrads

(This is the last of a series of articles presented to acquaint
students with student unions and the planning that has gone into
them at other universities with anei/e to ﬁnding he solution to

Pitt’s need.)

By IRV ROTHMAN
Pitt has been condemned as a “streetcar school,” it has
been termed a “machine,” and it has beenlconsidered a dis-

-mal prospect for incoming student who are looking
panionship and a rich college experiment.

for com-

Organizations have resolved themselves to the attitude
that “nothing goes over here” and even small turnouts are

is taken with mild surprise. “School spirit” which is so often

deﬁned in terms of attendance at:

college dances or meetings has tak-
en_ a beating and riquchof the
of

cause has been due to lack
proper facilities.

But when the first half of the

new, student union is completed

RUFUS H. FITZGERALD
Supports Union Idea.

about September of 1957, pros-
pects are that this will all
change. And although the pro-.
posed Student Union will be far
from a “cure-all,” it will resolve
many problems tha t have
plagued, not only organizations
and students, but also the regis-
trar’s. office.

This statement is not just wish-
ful thinking. Colleges and univer-
sities that have installed student
unions have declared the changes
to come about.

Streetcar Feeling Hit

An earlier article in the series
referred to administrators of Case
Institute of Technology who found
that their student union, Tamelson
Hall, eliminated the former street-
car college atmosphere. “The ef-
fect ‘of the union on the. campus is
that it‘ has brought traditional col-
lege life to" Case. Case can testify
to the values student unions afford
in teaching young people to work
and live together,” they report.

Northern Michigan College re-
sembles closest that type of union
which will be instituted at Pitt.
There, the union centralizes men’s
and women’s activities, with
dorinitories as wings of the union.
In our case, the union_will be built
first followed by men’s dorms
and then women’s dorms.

Socials Centered ‘

Michigan’s union centers social.
activities above the closely quar-
tered men and women, for “the
intent in most educational insti-
tutions to‘ isolate men's and wom-
en’s liying quarters only serves to
emphasize an unnatural situation.

Dean of Men, Theodore Bid-
dle, who serves as chairman of a
special faculty-student union
committee, expressed the same
desire to see the campus joined
at th new student Union which,
will go up behind Clapp Hall,
facing Ruskin Avenue.

Since he came here ten years
ago,_ Chancellor Rufus H. Fitz-
gerald, has been instrumental in
pushing for a union because he
always felt that one could trans-
form a student body. He saw it
Work at Iowa State University
where one was built while he was
there. ,.

But now, our student union is
in the ﬁnal planning stages. What
is said in the next six or seven
months concerning facilities to be
placed within it will be incorpor-
ated into completed plans. What
is incorporated will be up to the
suggestions 0 the students——under-
grads and part-time who will use
it.

There are representatives from
Student Congress, Men’s Council,
and WSGA on the Student Union
committee. They can be given
suggestions. They must also ﬁnd
it within their busy schedules to
attend future faculty-student-dis-

Silent Boyce tt

Student Congress conducted a full agenda of business
Wednesday, but ‘without delegates in full attendance. Ap-
proximately eleven solons reviewed issues which confronted
the selected» representatives of the student body. A few
were important. ’ _ ‘

However, legislation that was passed concerning the
change of ﬂoat parade to Homecoming day, for example,
was attested to by a minority of delegates-—and 1t wasn’
because of Spring Festival. Attendance has been lagging

1 since SC elections, and electees whose egos weren’t satis-

ﬁed with officers‘ positionsnhave been conducting a, silent

boycott.
It ,isn

’t that they don’t recognize their“ jobs.. They

just have something else. that seems more important than
conducting affairs beneﬁcial to the P1’tt‘student_ body as a

whole.

-Although animosities have built up as a

A result of elec-

tions, we can’t ﬁnd fault withthe president for lack of
interest in SC. Bob Sedler has attempted to whip— commit-
tees into shape before the year is out. He has expressed
the desire to. have a complete calendar worked out before
the end of the summer in order to establish a congruous,
organized program for, the coming year. He ,doesn’t. want
SC activities to begin in December, as is usually the case.
If the president could beconﬁdent of support from his
representatives, he might be more able" to. conﬁne discus-
sion on’ the floor to business which has been carefully map-
ped. out in committee instead ‘of hasty proposals. Such a
one for example, was the recent allotment of funds to
Men’s’ Debate organization. It wasted time. p
Thedebaters came. to Congress a week ago Monday
pleading‘ for funds to.run their organization. SC divided
an allotment of certain funds between the new student maga-
zine-and the orators, with more eventually going to the
talkers. But last Wednesday, it was revealed they didn’t

need it. 'The,Dean of Men’s ofﬁce graciously provided the.

state champs with additional funds. Thoroughbeforehand

investigation might have prevented the mix—up.

Sedler’s plan of action, an advanced schedule, might
well prove a solution to Congress’ problems-—if he can get
support for methodical presentation and sincere research in

projects which should be merited from representatives. '

chusetts.

Husband: “C’mere, baby. Your
lover—man’s home. The band
leaves in an hour for another
three-month tour. But before
I go, cool mamma, let’s smooch
a little.”

Law Sacred .
Statutes are passed to comply
with public opinion. Laws do
not always remain in concur-
rence with public opinion for
any great length, of time. But it
is much easier to pass laws than
it is to re-evaluate and modify
them. As a result the written
law often lags behind the spirit

. of the times. When public favor
has ‘forsaken a’ particular law, »

that law isusually ignored by
lawyer and judge» alike. ' V '

place to text books and lectures.

It showed itself each Saturday.

Spirit ﬁuctuates in publica-

speaker and honorary initiate at
the John Marshall Society din-
ner held last Thursday evening
for pre-legal students. Dean
Taintor explained that “there
are some laws which we speak of
as being repealed by obsoles-
cence. Common custom has re-
pealed them.” ‘

In his talk on “The Ethics of
The Advocate”, he cited the
necessity of circumventing cer-
tain laws——outdated laws. I-Le
dwelled upon divorce as a pro-
vocative problem. Only two
states in this country grant di-
vorce upon mutual consent of
the two parties. But in almost
every state, divorces are granted
in cases where, in actuality, the
only problem is incompatibility.
Trumped Charges

In such cases the attorneys
t-rump up a charge such as
mental cruelty, and with the
co-operation of the judge, they
obtain a separation. The reason

- such" things take place is that a

substantial portionof the popu-
lation accepts divorce as natural.
And when a law does’ not re-

‘ot

   

world issues‘and then leave details and agreements
up to the ministers to settle. ‘ 

But with both sides holding ”aces-in—the-hole”,

This deluge need not wait for
Carnival. But it does wait be-
cause it is during this period

that individuals lose their indi--T7

And the groups become organi-
zations. And finally the 'orgai1i-,-

It works because students are

mob with an aim in view... It,

dents-—'—for students to enjoy.

The same thing can besaid _

S for laws controlling vice and
gambling operations. Where it is

not good politics to enforce such
laws, they are not enforced.

Keeping Modern

The problem is this: how can

statute law, formalized» public
opinion, be kept up to date with
current public concepts of Jus-
tice? I’m not sure of an answer,
but it seems that our legal ‘struc-
tures are potentially dangerous.
Too much jurisdiction is left to
the discretion of the people hired
to prevent ‘and punish crime--—

' the joliceant judges.

The law is not followed to the
letter, because, in many cases, it
is considered out-moded. It is
more than likely that the luck-
less “cat” mentioned at the be"-
ginning of the column would
soon have convinced his “baby”
of it. Dean Taintor didn’t have
to do much convincing on the

subject at the banquet, however-

Workshop ‘Holds Exchange Meet

Through special
from the Nationality "Room and
‘S’ Awards, Nancy Jones, Col. ’56;

Shirley Ritz, ’56; Zora Getting, Ed:

’56, and Don Gartner, Col. ’56, will
leave in June for Europe.

The questions concerning the se-
lection of exchange students were
recently discussed at the workshop
sessions of the National Confer-
ence on Exchange held under the
sponsorship of the Institute of In-
ternational Education. 1

Promotes Good Will

“The U.S. Students” workshop
devoted considerable discussion to
the goals of student exchange. Two
goals were presented: an “unof-
ficial ambassador” whose most sig-
niﬁcant role is promoting good will
and mutual understanding be-
tween the United States and other
nations, or if the student were se-
lected on the basis of scholarship,
the goal of gaining the greatest ad-
vantages of a foreign education.

Recent research suggests that

scholarships.

these two goals may be recon-
ciled, but that primary consid-
eration should be given to the
student’s educational aims. Un-
less the student successfully ac-
complishes this purpose, the oth-
er goals of the exchange pro-
gram can not be realized.

The Conference recommended
that more orientation courses be
provided for American students
going abroad. They should consist
of language instruction, instruction
in the life and culture of the'coun-
try to which the student is going,
information on the politics of that
country, with reference to its po-
litical relation to the U.S.

Student Problems
American students at foreign
summer schools are not as ade-

lquately “received’ ’as they should
I be. The foreign institution "takes no
responsibility for relating the stu-
dent to the community.
Supervision while abroad is
important and necessary. The
l students are ‘expected to bring

mates interpretations of their
foreign experiences.

What young people are doing at General Electric

  Young scientist  

works on new ways
to handle “hot”
radioactive

Whenever uranium is “burned” in an atomic
reactor, certain valuable elements such as
plutonium are left behind‘ in the “ash.”
These products are highly radioactive, but
they must be recovered because of their great
value to the atomic energy program. i
This is the job of 31-year-old H. Ward
Alter, Supervisor of the Separations Chem-
istry Unit at the AEC’s Knolls Atomic Power
Laboratory, which General Electric operates

in Schenectady, N. Y.

Alter's work Is Vital, lmportant

Alter is doing his job well. He has already
received the Cotlin Award, General Electric’s
highest honor, for developing an apparatus
that makes possible faster, safer, and more
eflicient recovery of the valuable elements in

the “ash.”

The work done by Alter and his group
helps lower costs, increase efficiency and ex-
pand our knowledge of the chemical process-
ing of spent radioactive fuels.

25,000 college Graduates at General Electric

When Alter came to General Electric in
1948, he already knew the work he wanted
to do. Like each of the 25,000 college-gradw
ate employees, he was given his chance to
grow and realize his full potential. For Gen-
eral Electric has long believed this: When
fresh young minds are given freedom to
make progress, everybody benefits—the
individual, the company, and the country.

H. WARD ALTER joined CE. in 1948

hattan Project at Oak Ridge, 1944-46.

Trackmen Race at South Bend

Olsonmenwﬁattle Lions

After Meet

 

with Irish

By. STEVE BUTCHOCK

Faced with two dual meets in the short space of four
days, Coach Carl Olson’s cinder crew embarked today for
South Bend, Indiana, where they help Notre Dame’s Fight-
ing Irish open their home season tomorrow afternoon.

Then, on Tuesday afternoon at 1:30, the Olsonmen wind
up their home campaign against Penn State’s Nittany Lions

at the Stadium track.

Both the Irish and the Lions
will provide top-notch opposition
for the Jungle Cats-—the Staters
appearing to be even stronger
than the South Benders on the
basis of" early season results.

Olson is hopeful thatghis pro-

able to subdue
the H 0 o si e r
State entry but
that

Iterial t h a t

‘ner. And that’s
exactly w h a t
the Staters will
have in min d
Tuesday as they-attempt to dupli-
cate the close decision they carved
out at the expense of the Blue ‘and’
Gold last year.

Meanwhile on the Oakland
scene there is a good possibility
that sprinter Ed Saunders » m a y
return to action for these two cru-
cial engagements. If so, his pres-
ence would give the -Panther
chances at‘ much needed boast.

Allard in High Jump .

As usual the Blue and Gold will

be counting heavily on their great

erry

. running star—Sowell—to l e a (1

them to the dbuble victory. If they
accomplish this feat it will ex-
tend» theirocurrent dual meet win

    

streak to four. ‘

‘ Making a strong bid for top hon-
ors in the high jump will .be Notre
Dame’s Bernie Allard. Allard will

be seeking his fourth straight vic- i

tory in his speciality after winning  powerful Wild-

the high jump at the Kansas Re-
lays, the Drake Relays, and in the
opening dual meet with Missouri.

In last year’s meet there were
only two double winners-—Sowell
and’ sprinter Alex Pestrichella.
Both will be on hand again as
Sowell trys to win the 440 and
broad jump with Pestrichella go-
ing after the 100 and 220—yard
dash. .

I After Today’s Match with F &M

By MIKE BAER
If the series of victories over local competition has whet-
ted the tennis squad’s appetite for tougher foes, that ap-
petite may be more than. satisﬁed this weekend when the
Panthers tangle with the rugged Navy netsters at Annapolis

tomorrow.

This afternoon the servers meet
Franklin & Marshall in Lancaster
but it’s tomorrow’s match with the
Midshipmen that has the still-
hospitalized Coach Jim Tully con-
cerned. “Navy is definitely much
stronger than we are,” stated "-the
net mentor. “They meet the best
tennis team in the East and play
in a much tougher league than we
do,” he added.

Tully will‘ again count on the
-men in the middl e, Herb
Thompson and Art Derbasse, to
be the mainstays of the squad.
These two netsters, who are
number three and four men in
the singles and who team up to
make the number two doubles
team, have compiled. the best

L records on the squad. Thomp-
son, number three man, is the
only unbeaten server on the
team. He has won in every
match this season to compile a
record of eight wins against no
defeats. ,

Derbasse also has a very im-
pressive record with seven vic-

tories and a single loss. The team

wins and a solitary loss.
Pat Hughes, the netster’s num-
ber one man, has four victories

and an equal amount of losses.‘

Captain John DeCoux, playing the
second positionghas five wins and‘
‘three defeats. Lifts the number one
team, Hughes and DeCoux have
met with something less then great
success by winning only three
matches while dropping five.
Other records show, Jerry
Davis splitting‘ a‘ half a dozen
matches in winning three and
dropping three. Neil Zwieg has
two victories and three losses
while Bob Jacobs has a victory
and a defeat. Larry Mikoliet has
failed to gain a victory in three
efforts.‘

In doubles competition the
combination of Davis and Zwieg
has taken three out of four
matches. while the team of Davis
and Jacobs has won one match.
Jacobs and Zwieg have split two

matches while Mikoliet and Zwieg-

have lost a match.
Overall the tennis squad has
won seven times as against one

of Thompson and Derbasse has the defeat and has 45 match victories

best doubles record; also seven

as opposed to 27 losses.

For Traveling Mittmen

_ By AL PELAEZ

Pitt’s Traveling Troupe—otherwise known as the base-
ball team—play their fourteenth and ﬁfteenth road games
of the season today and tomorrow at Penn State.

State, with its impressive 7-3 record, should pose a tough
obstacle to the locals’ hopes of regaining the winning trail.

They’ve -lost four
games to the Panthers over the
past two years and feel that this
is their year for revenge.
Nevertheless, Coach Bobby Lew-

gerous than their 5-9 record im-

great style until a series of in-
juries coupled with a streak of
bad defensive play caught up with
‘them on their eastern trip last
week. “We’ve had a week to rest
and iron out our defensive trou-
bles and should be ready for the
Lions,” commented Coach Lewis.
“We usually play good ball against
them,” he added. ‘

The Panthers will counter by

Panthers Well-Balanced

The team champion will be
determined in Saturday’s action.
The four members of each team
will play 36 holes with the lowest

of this kind,” commented Mc-
Cormick.

The sixteen players shooting the

Phi Rho 6-3 Win
Over YMCA Nine
Brings IM Title

Playoff ﬁnals in the intramural
softball league saw Phi Rho, medi-
cal school fraternity, dumping‘ the
YMCA nine by the score of 6-3 at
Trees Field Tuesday afternoon.

Till the bottom of the sixth it
was quite a pitchers duel between
the Y’s Leonard Epstein and Med
Bob King with the med boys
holding a slight 2-1 edge, the Y
defense fell apart behind pitcher
Epstein to allow four unearned
runs to cross the plate and leave
the Phi Rho’s with a 6-1 bulge go-
ing into the last inning.

In their last effort at the plate,
the Y-men rallied and managed
to push two more runs over but
this fell? short by three markers.

Kink kept the hits well scattered
among the Y batsmen with only

one man managing more than one
safety—-A1 Rosenthal ‘collected two.

For_ the Phi Rho’s the big hitting
was supplied by shortstop Phil
Smith who conked out three safe-
ties in our trips to the plate. Smith

also turned ' in a sparkling per-_

formance at short with his fancy
ﬁelding robbing the Y-men of
more than a few hits.

With Phi Rho now winners of
the ﬁrst bracket, they will remain
idle until the winner of the second
bracket is determined. These two
winners will then meet each other
at a future date to wind-up IM
softball competition.

Sales Promotion and Control

Classes To Be Lead by Chapel

In the triple capacity of

executive, instructor, and stu-

dent, Robert J. Chapel is an enthusiastic example of the busy
man who always finds time to assume more responsibilities.

Chapel, who graduated with honors in ﬁnance from the
University of Chicago in 1934, received his M. S. degree in

1952 at Duquesne University, and

at Pitt.

is working on his Ph.D.

As a lecturer in the School of
Business Administration he con-
ductsclasses in “Economics of
Small Business,” “Theory and
Practice of Selling," and “Sales
Management." 1\Iext "school year
he will conduct two new clases
on sales training. '

These are “Sales Promotion,”
which will be offered in the 1955
fall semester, and “Sales Control,”
which is scheduled for the spring
of e 1956. Both these classes have
been a pet project of Chapel, and
will stress his creed that “The
only way to really learn how to
sell is to sell.”

Chapel’s experience ranges in
the small business and eco-
nomic ﬁelds.‘ He started as a
cost accountant and auditor for
Armour & Co. in Chicago, 1934.
In 1937 he left them to become
controller of the Acme Card

~ System Co.. and in 1938 he join-
ed Acme Visible Records, Inc.,
as a salesman, to become a Dis-
trict Manager for that firm in
1946. .

Besides teaching three classes,
studying for his Ph.D., and hold-
ing a full-time business job,
Chapel serves as faculty advisor
to the Lambda Chapter of Delta
Sigma Pi, national professional
business fraternity, and as vice
president in the Society for Ad-
vancement of Management. He

was elected a Fellow to the latter

merce as one of its “100 Young
Leaders” and was featured as such
in TIME magazine. For three years
he was a steward and member of
the Official Board of the Baldwin
