A policy statement on academic
integrity calling for “impartial
evaluation on the part of the faculty
and honest conduct on the part of
the students,” was passed at
Monday’s University Senate Coun-
cil meeting.

The statement, returned to the
sponsoring committees [Student
Affairs, and Academic Freedom] at

ing, was presented this time with
substantial changes in the guide-

dures.

Adoption at

According to the revised policy
statement, any member of the
University community may'bring to
the attention of the department
chairman or dean, a complaint that
a faculty member has failed in
some respect to meet “the obliga-
tions of academic integrity cited in
the statement. The chairman" or
dean has responsibility to investi-
gate, counsel and decide by
University procedures, the best"
course of action for the circum-

Pittsburgh voters will decide New '

ember 5 if they wish to adopt the
proposed city of Pittsburgh Home
Rule Charter or retain the present
system of city government.

A proposal to introduce Home.
Rule to Allegheny County was
‘defeated at the polls last May. The
present proposal, while based on
the same Home Rule tenets, is far
different from its county counter-
part. I

PA Senate Votes
Hosp. Regulation;

BY STEPHANIE HERDER

A State Senate bill passed last
week giving the State greater
control in hospital development
and_regulation has met with gen-
eral opposition from hospital ad-
ministrators and groups who claim
the state is not needed as a

‘_‘middle man" and doubt the
quality of government related
health care.

Children’s Hospital administrator
Harold Luebs called government
involvement in health care “lousy”
and said present problems in

 efficienty and health care execution

  

lead to deficiencies in services.
"Forty and 50 day delays in
Medicaid payments where people
are totally at the mercy of govern-
merit," said Luebs," are the types
of things that nick away at health

 
  
 

  
  

may areas formerly controlled by
state legislature. It will also create
a form of “district representation."

District.representation, the major

change suggested by the charter. is .

equal representation of all geo-

graphic, economic. and social areas

in the workings of city government.
Earlier drafts of the charter called
for election of city council members
by district, meaning each of the
distinct Pittsburgh communities
would have their own elected
member of council, but this propo-
sal was considerably toned-down in
the final draft. The charter
proposal now sets up Community
Advisory Boards drawn from each
district and advising the mayor and
council on issues relating to their
area. -
Pittsburgh would be divided into
districts by a vote of the council on
‘ccommendation of the mayor. The
Community Advisory Boards would
have no economic ties to city
government.
The toning—down of the “repre-
sentation by district" concept in
the Charter has met with strong
opposition from various factions
within the city. Two members of
the government study commission
which formulated the l-Iome Rule
Charter. Arthur C. Holloway, one
of two Blacks on the commission,
and Robert E. Kennedy. have
pledged to campaign against the
Charter because of the elimina-
tion of district council elections.
In a" minority report submitted
with the Charter, Kennedy states
“Without district elected council,
Home Rule will be meaningless.”

irresponsibility may seek to have
an adjudication reviewed by the
Provost, who may seek the advice
of the University Review Board.
Students may also appeal to the
University Review Board, whose
recommendation is then made to
the Provost.

Speaking for the Committee on
Tenure and Academic Freedom,
William Brown noted that each
school will be able toadapt these
policies informally to their own
situation and added,“This informal
procedure is an effort to reach
compromises between students
and faculty members. If, and only
if, serious academic injury results,
the procedures can become more
formal and remedial ac_tion would
be limited.” I

Under the guidelines of the
statement,_remedies in a student's;
behalf (such as re-testing or

. changing of grades) proposed by

department heads, should be
agreed to by the faculty member.
Other remedial action to benefit a
student may be authorized by
department heads only upon the
recommendation of the Review
Board or the Provost.

Several council members were‘
concerned faculty members would
be unjustly accused of dereliction
of duty when their grades were

A proposal for establishment of.

departmental minors in the College
of Arts and Sciences (CAS) was
approved at a CAS Cabinet
meeting Monday and will be sub-
mitted to Dean Robert Marshall
this week.

The proposal states “A minor
should be a series of courses in a
discipline studied in an integrated
fashion (unlike the present related
field where a student can take
anything he wants); the extent of
study would not be as in depth as
the major.” ‘

lndividual departments would »

have to specify the «number of
upper and lower level
required for the minor under the
plan which suggests the minor
should consist of’ half the credits
necessary for a major. between 12
and 18. Unlike the related field,
minors would be noted on a

student's transcript along with the’

major. .

Marshall will introduce the pro-
posal for discussion and voting in
CA5 Council. the chief policy-mak-
ing body for the College, comprised
of six faculty. ’members and five
students. all of whom belong to

ew Academic Rules Passe

Council member Barbara Shore
replied that only necessary details
concerning a case would be
transmitted to a review body.
“Once the problem reached the
Tenure and Academic Freedom
Committee, or the Review Board,"
she added, “a report of the
information would have to be
passed on to the committees."

Robert Mundell, an outspoken
critic of the policy statement at last
month’s Senate Council meeting,
said he found the revised document
“more palatable.” ¢ .

“l'm satisfied with the changes
that have been made," Mundell
said. “The objections I had against
theguidelines have been cleared

up.

if a department which currently
requires a related field decides to
accept a minor in another depart-
ment instead, “it must make
provisions to its present majors,"
the proposal states. Voharas added
that he will ask Marshall to arrange
for some supervision over the
departments in determining their
minor requirements.

During the meeting Voharas an-
nounced Bob Longwell and Carol
Rosen were selected" from five
applicants to fill positions on the
CAS Council left vacant last se-
mester.

Council member Cyril Fox, also a
former critic of the policy state-
ment. said he was not totally
satisfied with the revisions, but
added he favored the academic
code. -

Student Government Board [SGB]
member Bruce Keeler initiated a
motion to amend the policy
statement, insuring students pro-
tection from future prejudice due to
their involvement in appeals cases.
The ‘amendment provides that
records of a student’s action in
these cases will be “maintained as
confidential and retained in’ the
office of the dean of the department
or the Provost.” .

By voting to accept the policy
statement, the Senate Council
recom/riiends it be finally accepted
by the Board of Trustees at the
Board's Thursday meeting. If the
Board does adopt the policy

statement, it will be implemented _

as University law by January’ 1,
1975.

Chancellor Posvar reported’ the
“Greensburg Proposal" was with-
drawn for active consideration by
the State Legislature. The pro-

_posal. which called for changing

the program at Pitt's Greensburg
campus from a two year to a four
year upper division program, met
with serious objections raised -by

other four year private institutions .

in the area.

A bill providing Pitt with $1.3
million in supplemental appropria-
tions for the coming ﬁscal .year,
was pased in the State Senate,
Posvar also reported. The bill will
not be taken up inpthe State House
until after the November election,

T however.

In further action, SGB President
Mike Furick announced to the
Council that The Undergraduate
Academic Review (UAR) will be
published this ‘year. The UAR,
discontinued last October because
of disputes over its purpose. is
being re-instated with a new
approach.

PITTSBURGH AP--State and
local officials have 120 days to solve
their political differences over the
controversial Skybus system, the
Federal government ordered Tues-
day. '

The Urban Mass Transportation
Administration [UMTA] said in a
report that the rubber "tired, auto-
mated system is technically feas-
ible and warned the federal
government would 4 seek
reimbursement for the $15.6 mil-
lion it has already spent if Skybus is
scrapped.

The transit proposal, designed to
link Pittsburgh with "its. heavily
populated south suburbs, has been
the source of long standing contro-
versy, which has cut across party

lines locally and has involved even _

the state ‘government.’

The Allegheny County Port Au_th-
ority has steadfastly supported the
system, but the project came under
heavy fire from Democratic Mayor

That report found that while —
Skybus is technically feasible,

said it is willing - to‘ consider .

that substitutes would involve more

"I do not intend to be arbitrary or‘

Luebs said he is in favor of the
part of the bill requiring a hospital
to apply for a cert_ificate of need to
prove it is not duplicating services
or providing unnecessary facilities
and the bill's provision for licen-
sure of health care institutions. ’

“I find no fault with these two
provisions," Luebs said. “I think it
is a good role for government to
play." 1

Wicks is in favor of licensure but

opposes three-year renewal of
certificates of need. He said,
“Every three years, hospitals

-wold have to justify the need for

their facilities. This would endan-
ger long-term hospital financing.”
lnaddition, Wicks said the bill
calls for “too much management
input by the insurance commis-
sioner" beyond the responsibilities
he already holds in health care.

last June but was extensively
amended before passage in the
Senate last week. The bill now
goes back to the House for ap

Home Rule Foces Citizen Vote

(Continuied from Page I)

Holloway also filed a minority
report claiming the majority of
witnesses testifying before the
commission advocated council by
district while the ﬁnal proposal
does not. “There is in my mind a
firm conviction that the majority of
witnesses who testified before us
were ignored to satisy a favored
few.”

The National Assocation for the
Advancement of Concerned People
(NAACP) has also gone on record
as being in opposition to the Home
Rule Charter because of the ab-
senceof district council elections.

Pitt College Republicans vice
president Pat Nixon told the Pitt
News she felt the Community
Advisory Boards were “mere win-
dow dressing" and said she felt
cotincil by district “would open
council seats to people with less
money to campaign."

Nixon said she .felt a council
member who was elected by his or
her district would be directly
answerable to that district and
wouldibe a better representative.
She said she agreed with most
other aspects ‘of the Home Rule
proposal..

Pitt College Young Democrats
president John Rohc was opposed
to council by district. “This would
cause divisions within the city and
logrolling techniques. Every incin-
bcr on council should represent

every citizen." he said. Rohe was

also pleased with most other as-
pects of the Charter.

At present. city council is _on
record in favor of the Charter and
Mayor Flahcrty says helhas not yet
reached a decision. -

Along with allowing for Commun-
ity Advisory Boards, the new
Charter will provide for stronger
lawsiconcerning disclosure of an
elected officials business interests

and campaign contributions. It also ,

allows for the initiation of impeach-
ment proceedings “by presentation
of a written petition to the court of
common pleas signed by at least
twenty qualified electors who re-
side in the city.”

The charter retains the mayor as
chief administrative officer and
provides for- a “strong mayor"
system of government. It retains
the council elected at large. and
increases their ability to check and
balance the mayor.

Home Rule would also create the
office of city controller. The
controller would be an independent

Commission. .

The Home Rule Commission ask-
ed the Pennsylvania Economy Lea-

A gue to analyze the charter in terms

of cost to the taxpayer and found
that 'no additional costs would
result.

If adopted. the stipulations of the
Charter would go into effect on the
first Monday of January. 1976.

Once again the Chancellor has
made available to the College of
Arts and Sciences twelve Under-
graduate Teaching Fellowships for
the Winter Term, 1974-75. These
awards are worth $500 each. In
addition, the department in which
the particular course is taught may
choose to award academic credits
to the teaching fellow. presumably
through Independent Study.
plications for these awards should
be sent to Dean Robert Marshall in
917 Cathedral of Learning by
November 1. 1974. Announcement
of the awards. as granted by an

appointed committee, will be made

on November 8, 1974.
The following guidelines are to be
observed in preparing applications:

1. The faculty member should
submit a two or three-pate state-
ment explaining why he or she
wishes to work with a teaching
fellow in the course. and specifying
how the fellow is to be used as a
way of influencing the course's
purposes or the students‘ exper-
ience or the faculty's own develop-
ment as a teacher. '

2. The student should submit a two
or three-page statement explaining
both what his or her purpose, in
terms of personal development. is
in applying for the fellowship and

The idea that a war against

is ridiculous. Any narcotics squad
worth its salary could easily make a
lot of arrests at a place like Pitt,
where drugs are readily available
and blatantly used. The arrest of
six Pitt students at McCormick Hall
earlier in the term for marijuana
possession does not justify fears of
a narcotics crackdown. Visions of

Defending the Liberal Arts

BY ROBERT MARSHALL
In a previous article.,l raised the
issue of the role of Liberal Arts

' schools in a ‘career-conscious time.

l suggested that we ought to decide
either to reaffirm the Liberal Arts
ideal more vigorously and consis-
tently than we have or to enter into
a process of restructuring the
undergraduate program.

In this article, beginning today
and concluding in later issues, I’d
like to present some possible ways
of defending the ideal. In two other
future articles, I will outline some
possible directions of change.

In some ways l am'quite willing to
make even practical defense for the
Liberal Arts. but I feel sort of
abstract and semi-visionary as 1 do
-so. The argument that,l've given to
many groups . of students goes
something like this: Think of 20
people you know who are 35 years
old or older and who are doing
things with their lives that you
consider rewarding, creative. pro-
ductive. interesting.

Don't count people in that handful
of careers we most familiarly call
professions. ie. doctors, lawyers.
teachers. perhaps a couple of
others. Don't count them because
they (like me) took an easy road. so
to speak. at least as far as making
that crucial decision about what to
do with the rest of their lives.

In that handful of “professionals”
(I know there are exceptions among
individuals) one usually stakes out
a direction antl a purpose fairly
early and then follows a carefully
prescribed program to gain en-
trance into that career. I decided at
the age of 19 I wanted to teach
medieval literature- in college. I
didn’t have to make many more
decisions. .

I never seriously faced after that
the question that is so overwhelm-
ing for most students. most people.
ie. how to make a decent and

The Undercover Nare L R

tions—and the interfencc that the
University Police are the only
police who have any business on
campus——shows a total misunder-
standing of law enforcement at
Pitt.

Although Pitt's Campus Police
shoulder the main responsibility of
enforcing the law here. that does
not make the University immune
from the legitimate police agencies
of the city. county, state. and
country at which it is part.

Thus, the Pittsburgh Police and
Allegheny County Police have full
police jurisdiction here. They have
the right, by law,
investigations, make arrests, and

involve themselves in law enforce- '

ment at Pitt. ‘ e '
The idea that the Pitt community
should somehow be isolated from
outside law enforcement agencies

is foolish and unrealistic. The
University is not a “closed so-
ciety." ‘ '

lhink. then. of those 20 people.

but don't count the “profession."
Because there isn't much in this

A context for us to learn from that

experience. And then simply think
of whether or not those 20 people
were trained in school specifically
for what they are doing now,
whether or not they had been doing
that thing since they were 21. .1 bet

that the answer. with rare excep- ‘

tions. is no.

I think what you would find out, if
you thought about these 20 people,
is that what they were at 21 were
open, reflective, sensitive, aware
(throw in all the other Liberal Arts
ideal adjectives) people. And I
think_ you would find out that they
had done, a number of things
between the ages of 21 and 35, that
they had moved around and tried
out various possibilities, until their
talents and certain circumstances
came together at an appropriate
place and time.

You see, the message of the
Liberal Arts is. in very practical
terms, that it is better in the long
run not to be locked into a
particular career. not

can hold you captive because on
begin to think you have obligations
to them instead of to yourself. But.
the "long run" means long, means
"taking a gamble. means trusting
your own levels of development
and growth. means not getting an
immediate pay-off. means periods
of uncetitainty and struggle and
search. means having the courage
to have faith in your own future.
And it's always easy, l know. for
people like me with nice secure

' professions to say things lik_c that.

One of the inherent problems with
Arts ideal, as I'm
expressing it, is that it is in the

hands of professionals. the faculty. T

Part of that ‘problems is unavoid-

effective job. they could—and pro-
bably would——play a greater role at
Pitt.

On those occasions when outside
agents do make arrests at Pitt, they
almost always notify the Campus
Police in advance——not becuase
they have to—but as a courtesy.

The cditorial‘s assertion that the
involvement of non-University po-
lice in campus operations endan-
\ger's Pitt's well-being is mislead-
ing and inaccurate in another way:
cooperation between the Campus
Police and other police agencies is
absolutely essential to the effective
functioning of Pitt's force.

» Campus ’ Police Chief ‘Graham

says, “We would have an imposs-
ible time operating without the
Pittsburgh Police."

The Campus Police call on the city

to have ,
certain specific career skills that

able. obviously. but it does make
for difficulties that the only models
students have in the world of their
studies are people who have made
a living out of the Liberal Arts. lt is
almostan inevitable message in the
system that the best ofthe students
ought to want to follow in the
footsteps of their mentors. And
that. as l see it. is a pre-profession-
al message at. the core of the
Liberal Arts. _ A
Part of the problem—ie, the

increasing demand on faculty to

“professionalize,” to specialize, to

identify with the discipline rather ’

that with the institution and its
particular mission——is not inevit-
able. It has to do with the rewards
system, with criteria for promotion
and tenure, with measuring quality
in terms of visibility, but more of
that at anothertime.

lt has to do also. by the way. with
the very complex problem of dis-
tinguishing between‘ the missions
of an undergraduate Liberal Arts
college and those of a research
university. ‘particularly when the
same faculty are expected to ac-
complish both sets of goals. I
believe that these two missions
often (but not always) cause dis-
continuity in our system.

Others arguevi-gorously that each
mission gives life and vitality to the
other. What I wonder. then. is
what the difference in between the
nature of a Liberal Arts college off
by itself, and that a College of
Arts and Sciences at the University
of Pittsburgh.

ls there one liberal arts ideal for
both institutions? Do students
make subtle distinctions by type of
school? Don’t they more and more
go to the school they can manage to
go to?

l think that there is one ideal for
those two Liberal Arts institutions.
but that to accomplish. it at a
university, there must be a vigilant

11111013

police for aid in major crimes (rape,
murder, major burglaries) requir-
ing specialized investigations,
since the city possesses the exper-
tise and manpower /to handle such
cases. Also, the Campus Police
depend on the city for identification
checks on felony prisoners.

Finally. the Pittsburgh Police aid
in officer training. provide legal
advice. and teach classes to Cam-
pus policcmenton such topics as
sex crime investigation.

Thus. the emotional reactions to
rumors ‘of outside undercover nar-
cotics agents on campus distort a
major part oflaw enforcement at
Pitt. Not only do outside police
agencies have jurisdiction here,

their support and cooperation with’

the Campus Police is necessary to
insure the well-being of the Pitt
community.

Getting Abortion
Facts Straight

Dear Editor:

In response to the letter on
abortion in the September 16
edition of the Pitt News, I reply as

a member of the Pro-Life move- .

ment.

First, because the current legal
aspects of the abortion question
have not been amy area of special-
ization, in regard to research in
I’ro—Life, I leave it for another time
to make comment on "the Penn-
sylvania legislature's recent pas-
age of the new abortion law (Senate
1318) over the Governor's
veto." In the meantime, the claims
about unconstitutionality are being
checked into.

Secondly,‘ certain “devices of
propaganda” I detect amidst the
platitudes bandied about. The
perennial favorite of the abortion-
ists, that the right-to-life move-
ment is some male chauvinist
operation out “to deny women the
right to abortion and to control of
their own bodies,” sallies forth.
Aside from being an empty, trans-
parent catchphrase, it fails to
distinquish that having an abortion
and having control over one’s body
separate
things. .

Any good, human embryology
textbook will amply note the DNA
genetic-type individuation which
marks the zygote, conceptus, or
fetus not onlyas a member of the
human species, but having a

genetic unique to itself, distinct
from both mother and father
through genetic recombination.
Morphologically, the fetus deve-
lops not into a cantelope, turkey, or
appendix. but into a human being.
Genetically and cellularly, the un-
born child is human. Although the
child is dependent upon the mother
in the placenta, the child is “in"
‘and is not "part of” the mother.
To determine whether the ‘child is
a “human person" enters into the
areas of ethics, philosophy, or
theology. ln passing, let it be said
that the unborn's personhood can-
not be conslusively disproven,
philosophically. Because this is so,
always there will be room for
ethical doubt by anyone who has an

abortion; it will be like the hunter‘

who takes a chance, who shoots at
what looks like a" deer, and who
kills another hunter.

Lastly, mention is made that
Senate Bill 1318 supposedly “will
force many women who do not wish
to bear children to do so or face
unsafe, illegal abortions.” If the
child can be shown, with fair
demonstrability that he/she may
be considered a “person,” then the
freedom to have sex will automa-
tically incorporate the responsibi-
lity to be prepared to have children.

FUl'tlTCl't]]0l'C, what is the fabled
conceptual strawman, namely the
so—called “back-alley butcher,"
being conjured up for? There is no
such thing as a perfectly safe legal‘
abortion. Dr. Christopher Tietze,
one of America's.foremost abor-
tionists. clearly denotes that short-
term, second-trimester, postabort-
al complications do exist and are
possible for patients in “Legal
Abortions: vEarly Medical Compli-

4 THE BOOK CENTER

$7.95

   

cations." Volume 3. Number 4,
October. I971: FAMILY PLAN-
NING PERSPECTIVES. Also, no
surgery. of whatever kind, can
guarantee zilch complications.
Since the Supreme Court's ruling
for abortion on demand is hardly
two years old, I do not believe any
American statistics on long-term
complications can be said to "qua-
litatively exist. Besides, post-
abortal statistics are biased since
they come from a pressure group
source.

While the pro—abortionists are
entitled to free speech, they should

learn to get the facts straight. If

anything in this letter would be
challenged. we of Pro-Life are
always ready for public discussion.
In closing, we ask the opposition:
Are they willing to publieally
disprove that their foundation is
more than rickety? If not,let them

be forever silent!
I Sincerely,
J.A. Buzonas

“Sometimes I wish l lived in a
dorm so l wouldn't feel as left out
as I do..."

-Students. asked their thoughts on
commuting, seemed surprised any-
one would care. Although Pitt's
8,000 commuters make up 60% of
the Unviersity’s population, they
feel a common lack of interest from
the University.

According to Bob Heister, presi-
dent of the Commuter Association
[CA], “Commuters have been
getting the shaft.” Heister, a
former commuter, and the other
members of the CA are commuters
themselves, know their problems,
and are attempting to do something
about them.

Recently reorganized. the CA has
improved and extended their
services. The Trees Hall lot is now
open for parking. providing more
than were previously
available. and at a lower rate.

Preferential registration is now
available. making it unnecessary
for commuters to be stuck with
classes scheduled for inconvenient
times.

The Commuter Bandits put
nickels in expired meters, elimina-
ting possible parking tickets.

For commuters wishing to remain
on —campus, the CA and the Office
of Residential Life offer overnight
housing in MCNR for $1.00 per
night. This price is a big
improvement over the previous
charge of $4.50.

Many commuters have found it
cheaper to eat out than to purchase
a meal ticket. Beginning next year,
a meal ticket will be available at a
reduced price. through the cooper-
ation of the Director of Food
Services. The CA was told the
service cannot begin immediately
due to a problem with renumbering
the computer svstem. -

The CA computer car pool,
through help from Student Affairs,
Central Printing, and faculty
members, offers shared driving,
expense, and convenience.

Commuter Week was held this
year October 4-11 offering coffee-
houses. a tug-o-war. concerts. and
a bicycle-motorcycle display among
the scheduled events.

Uncle Charlie's Pizza Pub. soon to
open in the Hunt Room of the
Student Union. will offer a new
food service, and entertainment at
night. Heister claims the pizza will
be “better than anyone else's
around here.“

CA sponsers intramural teams in
volleyball, basketball, touch foot-

ball, and softball. Other teams‘ will .

be formed according to demand.
Sign up will be at the beginning of
each season in the‘ CA'office.

CA President Heister stressed the
Association's main problem is lack
of support. Hecomplains many
students use their services. but do
not lend time to help them work.
He feels the CA could do much
more if students would back them
up.

"As a case in" point. CA found
through a questionnaire in the

2, Is Somepluce that Cares

Association newspaper. "Magic
Bus, that most students wanted
reduced bus fare. The CA made
four attempts, but without more

student support. the action was.

beyond their capabilities.

Heister feels the CA gets “pushed
around” by Student Government
and the Allocations Committee.
The “Magic Bus,” -termed by
editor Keith McWilliams as the
communication that “keeps CA
together,” has been limited to four
issues at four pages each. A map is
published using two pages, leaving
only two for news. McWilliams
said, “We feel we were judged on
different grounds than the others
were.” With m.ore members,
Heister and McWilliams feel the
CA can show its authority.

The members of’ the Commuter
Association urge commuters to
offer their support and a little time
to make the Association work.

Bob Heister believes that. “With
the CA you don't go to Pitt, you
become part of what's happening.”

Tradition at Vassar Bookstore

« (e.g.

BY REBECCA SCHORIN

Somehow it is reminiscent of
Europe. Of old things instead of
new, ideas and traditions and the
inviting smell of musty books.
There are no computerized cash
registers, no neon signs on the
outside. Instead, a small hand-
painted sign at 4612 Winthrop
Street reads, “The Bryn Mawr-
Vassar Book Store."

It has been located there since its
inception, three years ago. The
brainchild of Barbara Aaron, it
began after years of Bryn Mawr’s
alumnae cIub’s successful three
day book sales. Then the Vassar
alumnae in Pittsburgh asked to
join in and the used book store
began to take shape.

This past summer the store was
remodeled and enlarged, offering
more room for books and for book
browsers. Now, there are six
comfortable rooms in the building's
two stories where thousands of
books line the walls and the tables.
Aaron estimates that the book store
handles "anywhere from '50,000
to 100.000 books a year."

The selection is extensive: litera-
ture and the arts. sciences and
social sciences. children's books
and a large collection of foreign
language books. There are—also a
number of recent textbooks in
various fields. In all these areas
‘there are both clothbound and
paperback editions and the average

price is $.35-$.40 a book.

All the Bryn Mawr-Vassar books
are donated from various sources.
“All kinds of people donate
books,” a volunteer said. “Alum-
nae, professors, people moving
from houses to apartments, estates
and even students who no longer
need their textbooks.”

The book store will pick up the
books ifthere is a large amount and.

all donors may receive a tax
deduction on the books.
The total crew of about 25

alumnae are all volunteers. work-
ing to raise profits that provide
scholarship money for Bryn Mawr
and Vassar students. \

Betty Sikov, volunteer worker and
‘treasurer ofthe enterprise said that
last year over $10,000 worth of
profit was divided evenly between
the two schools.

Terry: Clark, Vassar alumna class
of ’37 and former musicology
student there, sits at the front desk
of the book store on Friday morn-
ings. The 'desk is neatly stacked
with books and file cards for book
requests. Clark volunteers at the
book store “out of a firm belief in
the liberal arts education. I’m
terribly sorry for people who don’t
enjoy reading...l think it’s one of
the most important things, along
with music.” V

"We're a very dedicated bunch
here," she continued. “only the
rent and the utilities come out of

 

the profit, we even do our own
cleaning." Her dedication shows.

"She pulled an exquisitely old

volume out from a plastic bag and
said, "I'm learning to bind books
now."

“Between 75-100 customers come
in the store daily," said the Vassar
Alumna. “Students, dealers and
just about ‘all kinds of interested
people."

Clark came to the conclusion that
students nowadays aren’t very
different than when she went to
college: “The direction is differ-
ent, but there’s still the same
number of intellectually curious
students. Of course there’s more
freedom socially,
ideas and problems are essentially
the same.”

The . Bryn Mawr-Vassar Book
Store is only a five minute walk
from the Cathedral, (Winthrop is
off South Craig, two blocks up from
Forbes) and welcomes all brow-
sers. It is open six days a week (not
Sunday), every day from 10-4
except Saturday (10-1) and Wed-
nesday evenings 7-9.

PERSONAL OPINION

« Author’s note: This is the conclud-
’ irig, section of a two-part review of
' Against Rape by Andrea Medea

and Kathleen Thompson and
,_ Woman Hating by Andrea
- Dworkin. The first part which
I appeared in the Pitt News on

October 14, dealt directly with the
. books. This part presents opinions

on some of the larger issues raised
 by the books.

BY HARRIS LEVY

1. Comments: Society’s View of
Women Must Change. '
Why review Against Rape -and
Woman Hating together? I’ve put
them in the same article not
because they’re both books on
feminism, but they serve to point
out one of the main issues raised by
‘feminism--society's image of
_women.
 ,Society’s definition of woman as
"4 “camal, evil and other” to quote
A 7 Woman Hating permeates all as-
 pects of life.
I A‘ Rape is not an isolated instance of
 the way our culture views women.
.— . ‘Contempt for the female role
 begins in childhood. For instance,
I ] ‘what about the connotations of the

 
  

words “tomboy” and “sissy?"

Girls who assume “masculine”
traits are tolerated while effemin-
ate boys are met with disapproval.

Medea and Thompson state, “As
long as we accept. the stereotypes
that are presented to us in every-
thing from pulp detective stories to
Oscar-winning films, that women
are naturally passive, childlike, and
vulnerable, and that men are
naturally aggressive, brutal, and
uncontrollable--the rape situation‘
will not change.”

Kate Millett writes that relations
between men and women are
political. One way society perpet-
uates male dominance is its notions
on sexuality. Freud and others
have given us the mistaken notion
that orgasm for women begins in
the vagina. Because ofthirnotion,
the frequency of orgasm forvwomen
in heterosexual intercourse is low--
and it is attributed to female
frigidity. As Anne Koedt notes
“the cIitoris...is the center of
sexual sensitivity and...is the

’ femaleiequivalent of the penis.”

Female sexuality has been de-
fined by what pleases men. Many
men will find that penetration of

the vagina is not generally directly
responsible for orgasm.

It .is threatening to the traditional
notions of sexuality and male and
female relationships which oppress
women.

Society’s mistaken construction of
female sexuality complements its
derogatory emphasis on it. Against
Rape says “If an ordinary woman is
a piece of ass, a box, a lay, a cunt, a
hippie chick, a whore, then the
ordinary man is a rapist." Many
will find that statement unreason-
able until they take a look at
sexuality in the arts.

A recent exhibit by Gunter Grass
at Hillman Library included a
picture which had a serpent where
the clitoris should be. Films
restrict women’s options, older
women are not romantically
appealing while older men are.
The so-called “sexual revolution”
has brought a lot of nudity to the
screen--almost all of it female.
Films are just perpetuating the
situation that has existed in. fine
arts likeppainting and.sculpture for
centuries...the portrayal of women
according to their physical quali-
ties. .

Women are taught their work isn’t
important. Housework, which is
considered woman's domain, takes
99.6 hours a week (according to the
Chase Manhattan Bank) but isn't
even considered work by our
culture. Women are taught that
success in work will make them less
appealing to men. I know a student
who was afraid to tell her boyfriend
that she's gotten a better grade in a
course they took together. Women
are taught to limit their ambitions.
The results of the way people

‘absorb their sex rolesare obvious

at colleges and universities like Pitt

Following are two film reviews, both of The Odessa File which opens
at the Squirrel Hill Theatre this Friday. This once ever double review

should give the reader a greater ability to evaluate the individual
critic’s credibility for the remaining year. Readers should remember

that comments and letters are welcome.

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

The Odessa File explodes like a
powder keg on screen, Friday, at
the Squirrel Hill Theater.

At stake in the picture is the
existence of Israel which may be
threatened with nuclear and
biological warfare unless a top

secret organization known as_

O.D.E.S.S.A. is broken up.

Actually, The Odessa File, star-
ring Jon Voight and based on the
Frederick Forsvth bestseller, has
two plots interwoven into one
movie.

Plot one concerns the frantic
attempt by Israeli agents“ to have
the O.D.E.S.S.A.; a Maﬁa-like
organization protecting the former
SS‘ officers of the Third Reich,
inﬁltrated and sabotaged so that
deadly missiles to be given to

rNasser’s Egypt are destroyed.

The unnoticed suicide of an
elderly German Jew, Solomon
Tauber on November 22, 1963,
forms the basis of plot two...that of
the dangerous attempt by a
persevering journalist, Peter Miller
[Jon Voight], to carryout Tauber’s
last wish, to see the capture and
trial of ex-ss Captain Eduard

Roschmann [Maximillian];

Roschmann, known as “the butch-
er of Riga,” was responsible for the

deaths of thousands of innocent_

people including Tauber’s wife at a
concentration camp in Riga, Latvia.
After some violent episodes,

Miller ﬁnds Roschmann linked with

The technology of the movie
business threatens to overwhelm it.

When it all started out with a
couple of crude cameras, the dude
behind all the action needed an
imagination bordering on (and
often surpassing) the realm of
genius to create cogent, moving
stories with scratchy pictures and
no sound. The duds were separated
from the ﬁlmmakers yery quickly
under such very tough odds. '

The first innovation was sound,’
which, while opening up untold’
possibilities for the artists, also
opened up the doors to filmhacks
with little imagination. Now there’s
cinemascope, stereophonic sound,
and [the most hated “innovation of
all], the exclusive use of full color
photography spelling the demise of
black and white, which could be
manipulated for so many moods
that are now lost in a technicolor 
Sky. A2.’

So what happens? We get pictures
of people talking ‘instead of real

‘movies that include dialogue, and

lush scenery instead of evocative
scenes. And we've;gotten so used
to a level of mediocrity--particu-
larly- from the /‘mass-marketed,
rush-produced tiny screen world of
television--that we no longer blink
when handed a plate of pap and
told it's a gourmet dish. Lately,
movies have been on such ‘a
downhill spiral that it's more of a
pain than, a joy to visit the local
theatres. v_

Pgh. Symphony Presents

 Briiiioni Concert Pieces

J the‘ Classical Symphony by.7Proko-fr '

V Symphony,

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER
The Pittsburgh Symphony Cham-
bcr Orchestra concert of this last

weekend was quite a contrast to the

concert of a week ago. The earlier
concert used a large orchestra with
choir and soloists. and featured
only one work.

The more recent concert used a
very small orchestra (chamber
orchestra is a term for small
orchestra), and the featured works
were four “short subjects,” name-
ly,‘Franz Joseph Haydn’s Sym-
phony No. 55 in E-Flat Major
(“The Schoolmaster”), Ottorini
Respighi_’s “Gli Uccelli (The
Birds),” Haydn’s Concerto No. 1 in
C Major for Violin and String
Orchestra, and ‘finally, Sergei
Prokofieff’s “Classical Symphony
in‘ D Major.” I

The entire program was conduct-
ed by the music director of both the
Pittsburgh Symphony
and Chamber Orchestra, Dr. Wil-
liam Steinberg. Soloist in the
Haydn Concerto was the Orches-
tra's concertmaster, Fritz Siegal.
There was also a brief solo for 'cello
in the Menuetto of the Haydn
done most ably by
principal cellist, Michael Greban-
ier.

Although the Haydn Symphony‘
is titled “The Schoolmaster," it is

not the firm, rigid sort of thing one"

wouldexpect. in fact, the work is
free, light hearted, and humorous.

At the same point where Haydn’s
-fanious “Surprise" occurs in his
Symphony No. 94 (“Suprise"), at‘
the beginning of the second move-
ment. there is a somewhat abriipt
forte passage.

Although the Symphony follows
standard form for Haydn’s sym-
phonies, it is not a typical work.
The beautiful solo, which Greban-

‘ier, performed excellently, in the

trio of the third movement, the
menuetto, adds brilliant yet subtle
contrast to the general tone of the
movement, and the active final
movement is a perfect closing for
the work. ‘
The‘Respighi work, “The Birds,."
turns out to be a real gem of a
piece. It is a free arrangement, in

' five movements. of five works by

composers of the 15th century.
The first i movement. Preludio,
sets the tone for the rest of the
work through allusions to various
bird-call'motifs,,' while the reniain—
ing fourmovements concern speci-
fic birds. Some of the birds are
represented literally. such as the
nervous cluck-clucking of the hen
and the familiar call of the cuckoo.
The dove and nightingale are
represented more by mood than by

"literal approximation of the sound

of the birds. -

This is a very charming piece,
featuring much skillful orchestra-
tion. Its delicate fabric is enhanced
by inclusion of harp and celesta.
Hopefully, the success of this piece
and Respighi’s.setting of Bach’s
“Passacaglia and Fugue in C
Minor,” heard earlier this year,
will encourage consideration of
more works by Respighi for next
year. 4

The Concerto for
String Orchestra by Haydn is
designed to show the soloist's
virtuosity, yet is carefully written to
take of the total potential of the
accompanying strings.

Final work on the program_ was

Orchestra’

fieff. probably the best know work

on the program. It may not be true
that the composer deliberately
wrote this piece as a satirical
imitation of the older classical style
of symphony, but it does no harm
to consider it in that light.
Prokofieff had been annoyed
when a work of his was forced to be
withdrawn when censors found it
politically unsuitable, and so he
turned to a totally innocuous med-

ium—the classical symphonic
form.
The work is supposedly what

Haydn might have written. were he
alive at that time, but we cannot
help thinking that there must have
been a small grin on the compos-
er's face when he ’ wrote the
extremely florid, the almost too
delicate.
movement.

The high caliber of this composer
is demonstrated, however, in that
he never gets “carried away" with
the satirical element of the work,

melody of the second

and the result is a brilliant, light.
humorous treatment.
The third movement is another

‘ subtle signpost of satire, since the
traditional minuet is replaced by»

another form, the gavotte. What is
probably even more ‘significant, if
this were not enough, is the
gorgeous melodic line of that

When Miller's life becomes more
endangered as he tangles with the
O.D.E.S.S.A., he is even more
determined to carry out Tauber's
last wish. Why? (Can it be that
some of Voight's goodwill has
transferred from Conrack?) Mil-
ler's determination turns into an
obsessive compulsion for ven-
geance against Roschmann.

Outside of intrigue and entertain-
ment, The Odessa File may also
serve as a reinforcer to those
segments of the audience who are
always seeing conspiracies in the
world such as the Arabs banding
together to destroy the free world's
economic system via high oil'prices
or Communists working as a
monolithic force to eventually take
,over in America.

Another important point is the

. movie’s powerful message which

lies‘ in Tauber’s diary and is echoed

. later. in the film. In his diary,

Tauber writes, “I bear no hatred or
bitterness toward the German
people, for they are good people.
People are never evil: ONLY
INDIVIDUALS ARE EVIL...
THERE IS NO COLLECTIVE
GUlLT...T_herefore, guilt is indi-

' vidual like salvation...Yes, ONE

CAN EVEN FORGIVE. BUT ONE
CAN NEVER FORGET."

Lastly, Maximillian Schell, lately
of the brilliant. The Pedestrian, is
quite good as Roschmann es-
pecially during his very desperate
and fruitless attempt to defend his
actions at the Riga camp.

The Odessa File is without a doubt
one of the year's best films. After
this past summer and fall of reruns
(Dr. .Zhivago) , and junk (The
Parallax View and The Day of the
Dolphin), it is a real treat to see a
damn good picture like The Odessa

Except for a boost by Elia Kazan's

up, and has to “kill or be killed."
(Didn't George Raft do this about

84} times?) But he still accomplishes
his mission beyond everyone's

expectations. and marches on .to

interesting plot twist. if only it were
dealt with properly.

All that takes more than two
hours? .

The last time a Frederick Forsyth
novel (The Day of the Jackal) was
made into a movie, it suffered from
over-mechanization of plot and too
little concentration on the drama of
human conflict. The Odessa File
doesn't even have that snap,
crackle and pop of whirring gears
and complex story lines.

The whole question of the guilt in
Germany and the Nazi war
criminals was best explored in last
year’s The Pedestrian [and by _a
rather sick irony, the.writer/pro-
ducer/director/star of that work,
Maximillian Schell, is cast in The
Odessa _File as the “war

criminal”]. The tale of the
‘_‘innocent bystander,” getting
involved in espionage by mere
chance [as Miller points out that he
did] has been done so well many
times ‘by __the master,
Hitchcock, [and mostly in black and
white as befits a suspense ﬂick],
that The Odessa File looks like a
poor imitation of a comic book.

The greatest problem is the total
hack job by a director who should
scurry back into obscurity after this
movie. He has no conception of
what to do with a camera, letting it
drag out scenes and anticipate the
action. And he has little awareness
of the purpose. of music in a— ﬁlm.
It's not just frivolous background to
fill the soundtrack, but an
embellishment that. properly used,
creates and heightens mood.

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR

Some of Pittsburgh's greatest humor can be found on the
entertainment pages of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh
Press.

‘ No, I’m not talking about Ed Blank or Pete Bishop...those bores

aren’t even ﬂowered wallpaper, just bland, cream-colored plaster. I’m
talking about the advertisements...the porno films...the filth and trash
that Liberty Avenue survives on...the_backbone of the freedoms so
sacred to every horny American.

It has onlybeen with the recent coverage of the Wilbur Mills scandal
that pornographic humor has been brought to the nation's attention.
Reportedly, his close neighbor and- drunken friend is a stripper who
performs under the name of Fanne Foxe. the Argentine
A;.i.recracker...what a beauty, eh?

, I But that’s only a start, there’s much, much more like film titles such

as The Rise and Fall of Sparkie, Inside of Me, Lunch. Miracle Whip,
Deviates, Peacock Lady. Meatball, Slip of the Tongue Jdescribed as
“explosive action”], Ice Box, School pf Hard Knocks and Cousin
Betty. ‘ I i C

The titles are great, but more often it's the side comments. in small.
almost invisible print that are the real beauties. For instance: “in
patient. out patient. it made no difference to her“ (from Nursemaid);
“she dreamed of making love to her step-daddy" (from Little Girl
Blue); “they'll try anything again and again and again" (from The New
Comers); “college--a good place to make friends and other people"
(from Campus Girls) and “she knew her place and always kept a good
head” (from High Rise). .

"I have no idea who should be credited with the laughs, but somebody
somewhere was breaking backpon Campus Pussycats. Delight in this
one film's comments: “the reason every dorm room is fireproof,”

/—:.;".you’ll get an education the VA never approved,” “meet the minors

-who major in love” and “the educated co-eds--they have the campus
franchise on wild pleasures.”

' This is good stuff. better than your typical dirty joke or filthy mouthed
slob. It takes little talent to yell out Obscenities or twist the beauty of
sexual intercourse into a drunken ugliness. ,

But puns, oh yes, the beauty of puns. Sure, sex jokes are overdone,
but it seems to me that we are well on the way to de-emphasizing
them...I trust that soon, sex will loose it’s filthy fantasy, and sex_ jokes
will rate along with tree and sidewalk jokes.

But I hope that no future generation‘ will have to live without Teen-age

Women have been restricted by
their ability to bear children. Just
because they can doesn"t mean that
they have to. And just because
women give birth _to children
doesn’t mean they should be
saddled with full responsibility for
their upbringing.

Dworkin describes several ways
women mutilate themselves for the
sake of prevalent notions of beauty.

"While cosmetics imply the real
woman is not enough. shaving says
the real woman is too much." says
an article in The First Ms. Reader.
Think about it--is there any good
reason women are told to shave
their legs and armpits while men
aren't‘?

Advertising. textbooks. and reli-
gion are other areas that have
transmitted our cultures negative
image of women but one of the
worst offenders is psychology. In
Women and A Madness, — Phyllis
Chesler observes that psycholo-
gists' concepts of healthy mature
adults and healthy mature males
are identical. But psychologists
perceive healthy mature women as
being "more submissive. less
independent...more excitable in
more easily hurt.
more emotional. more conceited
about their appearances“ and
"less objective."

Concepts like penis envy are
-obviously. ridiculous.
gerous are the subtler ways in
which psychology contributes to
sexism.

Noon Friday At Stadium

BY G.W. STEVENS
Associate Sports Editor

At yesterday's Pitt Media Lunch-
eon. Johnny Majors seemed
pleased with the Panther's per-
formance on Saturday against West
Virginia. The ‘squad had put
together a winning offensive and

/defensive effort for the first time

this year. especially in the second
half. And perhaps the win over the
Mountaineers will give Pitt a much
needed lift to carry them through
the remainder of the season just as
last year's win over WVU propelled
the Panthers to a Fiesta Bowl

varsity squad. executing the plays

 of the team that will oppose the
 ~ varsity on Saturday afternoons.

They have played the role of

Seminoles, Yellow Jackets. Tro-
jans, Tarheels, Mountaineers, and

On Friday afternoon they meet
Kent State at noon at Pitt Stadium,
and for t_he second time this year
they will be the Pitt Panthers. ‘

Pitt's JV football team faces the

“Smooth ’’ Knight
Scores In ABA  

BY YAIER LEHRER

' '- For three years, the most familiar

sight at a Pitt basketball game,
including “Tiger Paul" Auslander,
was the grace and skill with w. ich
Bill "Mooney" Knight plied his
last year leading his

streak and a spot in the NCAA’
senii-fiiials.

The athletic department had
billed him as “A Knight to
Remember.,” which indeed he
was. He still deserves that title,
and probably always will, but
instead of scoring baskets for the
Panthers this season, Knight will
be doing the job for the Indiana
Pacers. '

The All-Anierican was Indiana's
first selection in the ABA draft as
well as the Los Angeles Laker‘s
second choice in the NBA draft.
Instead of going with the well-es-
tablished team. Knight signed with
a team that many people feel is
near the top of a league sadly
inferior in quality to that of the
older league.

“The all-around contract offer

« from the Pacers was lots better

than that of the Lakers." said
Knight. “I also think that the team
in the ABA are just as competitive
as those in the NBA, and if the
Pacers were in the NBA, they
would be just as competitive as the
other teams in the league."

The competition in,pro ball ‘has

 

caused a slight change in Knight’s'

style of play. The game includes a
lot more running, but .more
important, the pro game is a lot
more aggressive than the type
played in the college ranks.

“In my first exhibition game I got
elbowed in the eye and hit on the
arm. The eye was cut, and the arm
swelled up." said the former Pitt
star. “You're forced to more

Golden‘ Flashes in their second
game of the season, having already
recorded a 14-0 victory against
Potomac State. "

Head JV Coach Bob Leahy is
responsible for overseeing the

_squad, and he talks about Pitt's

game plan against Kent State.
“We will use various offensive
allignments, including the I, pro
set, split backfield, and slot forma-
tion. We passed 15 times last

game, and this game we’ll continue

to try for a balanced attack.

Defensively we’ll use a 50 defense, '

the same defense that the varsity
uses. We’re expecting Kent State
to have a good team.”

One area of play which Leahy
hoped the Cats would improve on is
the number of penalties, since
against Potomac State they were
charged with 95 yards in penalties.
At the same time, however, Leahy
noted that both the offensive and
defensive lines played well.

The offensive line is composed of
Jim Buoy, Brad Schmidt, Walt
Brown, Jeff Matthews, and John
Richardson._ Behind them are Matt
Cavanaugh and Bernardo Paez at
quarterback, with Tom Sindewald.
Willie Taylor and Calvin Glover
completing the backfield. Tim
Padovese and Willie Marsh play
the tight end and flanker positions,
respectively.

Defensively, Pitt will start Ed
Ford, Paul Test, Steve Pritchard,
Richardson, and Gary Tyra on the
line, linebackers Kurt Kovack and
Tom Rechichar, monsterback Dave
DiCiccio, and Eugene Connors, Bill
Parkan, and Marsh in the second-
ary.

The defense couldn't be blamed
for last year's Panther loss of the
game, which Kent State won 7-0.
Revenge will certainly be on the
minds of the Panthers, as will be
their attempt to remain undefeated
in JV play.-

Conie Monday practice. however,
the JV team will turn into the Navy
Midshipmen, who the varsity plays
next Saturday. . -

together,” said Majors. “We put it
together on offense and defense.
The offense just picked up where
they left off at North Carolina and
the defense came back.”

"The players and coaches had
good enthusiasm on the practice
field last week,” he continued.
“They knew it was a very
important game to get us back on
the right track." ‘

One thing for sure. the offense is
finally on the right track. ‘They
continue to improve weekly’ despite
nagging injuries to Tony Dorsett.
around whom the Pitt attack
revolves. Dorsett, who was also in
attendance yesterday, showed a bit
of his old form on Saturday as he
ripped through the WVU defense
for over 140 yards. “T.D." wasn't
willing to blame his injuries for
slowing him down in the first few
games, -however.

“I don’t want to put it all on my
injuries,” Tony said. “I was
thinking too much about what I was
going to do instead of just attacking
the holes. I would slow down and
try to fake instead of just
attacking.”

Coach Majors viewed the problem
a little differently citing the lack of
experience up front as a possible
reason, for Dorsett's decreased
effectiveness. . -

“We haven't been moving people
off the line like we did last year,”
commented Majors. “In a case like
this with a lot of inexperience on
the line. the runner may be waiting
for the -linemen to open up the
holes and the linemen are waiting
for the runner to bust off some long
runs. But as they get more
confidence and inexperience the

ig Lift

holes open up and the runner can
do his job. Then that gives the
linemen more confidence."

But the missing Dorsett yardage
hasn’t been all bad for the
Panthers... It has produced an
interesting side effect which is the
improvement of Pitt’s passing
attack. The receiving duo of Karl
Farmer and Jim Corbett turned in
another fine performance against
WVU, and Billy Daniels’ arm gets
more accurate every week. Add the
outstanding receiving of Bruce
Murphy, and Pitt has a potent

i attack which will aid in keeping the

pressure off the runners.

If the Panthers are to finish theiiﬁ

schedule in a big way, they will
have to get by a stubborn and
improving Boston College team
this Saturday. The Eagles dropped
their opening two games to Texas
and Temple but came on to
overwhelm Navy and William‘ &
Mary. '

“Our scouts are very impressed
with Boston College," said Maj-
ors. “They're big up front and
they're strong. They gave us a lot
of problems last year, so this
should be quite a challenge to our
players and coaches.”

Majors praised the play of several
.of his defensive starters, nam

Kelcy Davistop, Cecil Johnson, and’ 

Don Parrish. They will have their
work cut out for them this week
especially‘ up front against a big
offensiveline which Majors called ‘
“one of the best we will face.”
But the Eagles will also have a
tough time facing a revived team
after a big win which Majors thinks

\

K

“should give our team adde 3-.‘
enthusiasm and confidence to Carr , '4

Knight has seen a lot of playing
time and has shown himself to be of
professional caliber. In an intra-
squad game with the rookies vs the
veterans. Knight pumped in 30
points to lead the first year men on
to victory. I

got away from my man. saw Jabbar
coming, and it just happened. The
crowd went wild. but the shot
rolled off the back of the rim and
missed."

In yet another game, Knight
started against the Atlanta Hawks
and found himself guarding Lou
Hudson. “Smooth” managed to
tally 16 points and hold the usually
prolific Hudson to a minimum.

Although playing the game is
enjoyable, the schedule can only be
termed as rigorous. In the space of
four days the Pacers may play four

“They really want to play. You

removed the dead wood and
trimmed the fat from what used to
be a complacent Ranger team.

Bruce MacGregor are gone and
Francis has started the move to

on the GAG line, The Cat swapped
the potential of hard shooting

Bernie Parent had unbelievable
season enroute to sharing the
Vezina Trophy, playing in 73
games and posting an amazing 1.89
average. It's so unbelievable, you
have to wonder if it can be
duplicated. The addition of Wayne
Stephenson from St. Louis provides
an adequate backup who should be
used more than Bob Taylor was last
year.

The Flyers have ' tasted the
champagne from the Stanley Cup,
but a team hasn't won the coveted
silver two years in a row since the
late sixties. With the new divisional
allignment and Fred Shero's tactics
well known, everyone will be
ready, waiting and well rested coe

squad of unselfish team players in

With Dan Bouchard and Phil
Myre in goal the Flames need only
to ﬁnish above the Islanders to get
a shot at the quarterﬁnals. Tom

' Lysiak is an up and coming center

and Jacques Richard has been
likened to Jean Beliveau, in his
early years.

The New York Islanders may have
cut their_goals against last season
from 347 to 247. but the offense
still lacks the power to catch the
Flames. The loss of Gerry
Desjardins to the WHA cut the
depth in goal but the Islanders still
need at least a- pair of 40 goal
scorers to make a real go of it.
