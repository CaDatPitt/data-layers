Pitt basketball
super-fan dies
after collapsing
at women’s
away game

Patrick Robertson
Sports Editor

A student volunteer basketball assistant
‘died Friday night at the Pitt vs. Duquesne
women’s basketball game.

Anthony DePasquale, 20, who suffered
from muscular dystrophy, was pronounced

dead at 8:10 p.m. by a doctor at Mercy
Hospital. Sunday’s hospital staﬁ did not
have access to DePasquale’s records to oom-
ment on his death, but the Allegheny County
Coroner’s Office said he died of natural
causes.

He attended many Panther sporting
events but was most prominent at basketball
games. Last season, he sat along the end line
and cheered the team. He enjoyed basketball
and could always be seen wearing some sort
of Panther paraphernalia.

This year, DePasquale worked as a vol— ’

unteer statistician for the men’s basketball
team from behind the team bench.

He also attended practices and was seen
talking to the players on the team before and
after workouts.

DePasquale watched the games from a
wheelchair because of his disease, but didn’t
let that keep him from attending. E.J.
Borghetti, Pitt’s media relations director,
said the Panther players noticed
DePasquale’s dedication to the team.

“He was our nurnber—one fan. He was
loved by the men’s basketball team,”

Borghetri said.

Workforce still unfair to women

Jessica Miatki
Staff Writer

As more than 50 percent of Pitt’s
seniors polish resumes, write cover let-
ters, and check the Career and
Placement Services’ resources religious-
ly, they are unknowingly about to face
an obstacle that the rest of the students
will never confront.

These students have the same
grades, are active in the same extracur-
ricular activities, and have the same
amount of volunteer work strategically
placed on their resumes. They wear gray
business suits to interviews. They offer
ﬁrm, aggressive handshakes.

These students are Pitt’s women.

After most women get their first,
second or even third job, they still will
be behind the men. They face an invisi-

ble barrier that holds them down and
keeps them away from opportunities
offered to a worker of equal qualiﬁca-
tions.

Tomorrow:
What women are doing to
break the glass ceiling

More than 50 percent of Pitt’s
seniors are women, and the obstacle they
face is the “glass ceiling,” which repre-
sents the lack of opportunities and deﬁ-
ciencies in pay that women experience
every day in the professional world.

Pay discrepancy, as well as other
obstacles that stiﬂe women in the corpo-
rate world, was the focus of a women’s
panel held Friday at Pitt’s Katz Graduate
School of Business.

Top executives from Bayer Corp.,
Dollar Bank, PNC Private Bank and
American Home Patient discussed their
success and the different roads that led
to it.

Margo Barnes, senior vice president
of corporate communications at Bayer,
warned women to be aware of their
rights. She said she’s seen too many
women cautiously and quietly tapping
on office doors and apologizing for
interrupting.

“You have every right to be there,”
said Bames.

WOMEN

According to the Institute for
Women’s Policy Research, which has
made calculations based on three years
of pooled data, the median earnings of
women in the United States who were
full-time, year-round workers in 1995
was 72.3 percent of the median earnings
of their male counterparts. In other
words, women were earning about 72
cents for every dollar earned by men.

At the same time,
women in
Pennsylvania were
earning about 71.2
percent of what men
in Pennsylvania were
earning. The
Pennsylvania wage
gap is greater than
the national gap.

Some advocates
say that women’s
wages may still be
considered supple-
mental to men’s, that
women are taking
time off from work to
raise children, and,
that they may be tak-
ing lower—paying
jobs. The situation
may have changed
since this study. ~

However, these reasons do not
explain why the nation’s highest-paid
female corporate executives cam 68
cents for every dollar earned by the
highest-paid men, according to Catalyst,
a New York-based nonprofit group that
works to advance women in business.

According to Labor Department sta-
tistics, women eamed 76 cents for every
dollar men made in the first quarter of
1998.

“There is not one simple, single

explanation,” said Sheila Wellington,
president of Catalyst. She said a number
of factors contribute to the difference.

Those extra 33 cents on the dollar
over a couple decades could prove to be
the difference between the down pay-
ments on a Chevrolet Cavalier and a
Saab convertible.

Irene Hanson Frieze, a professor in
Pitt’s department of psychology;
Josephine E. Olson, associate dean and
professor of business administration at
the Katz School;
and fellow Katz
professor Audrey J.
Murrell surveyed
Katz graduates
from 1973 to 1982
to study the wage
gap-

They surveyed
the graduates again
in 1984 and in
1991, looking at,
among other fac-
tors, the 1990 salary
differences between
male and female
workers who had
master’s degrees
and were employed
full-time in 1991.

What they
found, was that
Katz graduates

were actually doing better than the state
and national averages.

Even when the differences in work
experience between men and women
were controlled in the experiment,
women made about 15 percent less than
men, according to Olson.

“In my opinion, as men and women
get older and have more experience, the
salary gaps widen, even when we con-
trol for years in the work force and job
interruptions,” said Olson.

His term won’t begin until next semes-
ter, but the new Student Government
Board president is already busy organizing
new board members and planning an agen-
da.

“If you get olfon the right start in the
first four months, you’re going to go in the
right direction,” President—elect George
Mongell said.

He said the new student government
will be “ready to go” on Jan. 14, the day
after the inauguration.

Mongell started paring twosvdays
after the election results were arfnotfnced.
He spent the week- . '
end before
Thanksgiving break
meeting with every
new board member
in person, by tele-
phone or by e—mail.

Topics of dis-
cussion included his

THE PITT News

 

Consulting not only student groups but
also to individual"students to “get the com-
munication ball rolling” was one of
Mongell’s primary campaign themes. He
said he wants to target every student
because he feels a majority of them don’t
realize they have an important voice on
campus. ‘

To be a good SGB president, “you
have to make sure you’re focused and
know what you want for yourself, but you
have to listen to everybody” to make sure
students are involved in the governmental
process, he said.

romnent will foster open communication
and cooperation among board members.

Mongell also met recently with current
SGB President Alyson Wallach to discuss
effective methods of encouraging commu-
nication among board members.

Next year’s board will represent a
diverse array of perspectives from across
the student body. That, Mongell said, is a
positive attribute because different view-
points will help the board make thorough
decisions.

“That kind of philosophy is going to
help in the long  he said.

The ﬁrst of Mongell’s plans that the
student body will be able to participate in is
a meeting, tentatively scheduled for late
January or early February. SGB will invite
all student groups to attend an in-depth dis-
cussion of student government; the new
board’s plans, goals and objectives; and
ways SGB and student groups can work
together.

Such a program has never been held
before, to the best of Mongell’s knowledge.

“Students want you to come to them,
and then they’ll come to you in return,” he
said.

next year. Other issues might include lists
of individual members’ campaign pron1is-
es, each of which would be checked off as
members fulﬁll them.

Making sure that board members keep
their campaign promises is an important
matter, Mongell said. He will, in all likeli-
hood, require members to submit a weekly
itinerary that details their objectives and
how they plan to accomplish them. At the
end of the week, he said, members would
be responsible for submitting a brief report
summarizing their progress.

These detailed reports not only
would keep board members working hard,
but would also add substance to members’
weekly reports, which this semester have
averaged only a minute or two in length.

Mongell said members’ written reports
might also be available for scrutiny by the
student body.

SGB’s objectives will be met “if I
myself have to stay up all night,” he said.

Mongell said student reaction will ulti-
mately measure the success of his board.

“At the end of the year, if [the stu-
dents] can say, ‘This is what student gov-
ernment has done for us,’ that’s how we’ll
know we did a good job,” he said.

Cadet breaks neck

PHILADELPHIA — A cadet who
suffered a broken bone in his neck after
falling from a broken railing during the
Army-Navy football game Saturday has
improved and was due to be released
from the Thomas Jefferson University
Hospital Sunday afternoon.

Hospital spokesman Jeffrey Baxt
said the West Point cadet, identified as
22-year-old Kevin Galligan from
Fairhope, Ala., has been upgraded and is
in good condition. The victim was listed
as guarded after the accident but spent
the’ night in the intensive care unit,
where he was listed as critical but stable.

Nine people were taken to four area
hospitals for treatment after about a
dozen people fell about 15 feet to the
ground following the collapse of a rail-
ing at Veterans Stadium. A 10th person
also fell but was not initially considered
injured; he was treated after he accom-
panied one of the victims to the hospital.

The railing, located in the first row
of the east end zone, gave way as the
fans were cheering for television cam-
eras after Army took a 31-30 lead.

The injured included cadets from
the U.S. Military Academy in West
Point, N.Y., and students from the U.S.
Military Academy Prep School at Fort
Monmouth, N.J.

ST. CHARLES, Mo. — A father
has been found guilty of first-degree
assault for injecting his ll-month-old
son with HIV-tainted blood.

A jury in St. Charles convicted
Brian Stewart last night after eight hours
of deliberations. Jurors recommended
life in prison, and sentencing is set for
Jan. 8.

Stewart was passive as the verdict
was read, but the boy’s mother sobbed
and had to leave the courthouse shortly
after. The child, now 7, has full-blown
AIDS.

Prosecutors say Stewart stole the
tainted blood when he worked as a hos-
pital technician in 1992, and he injected
his son to avoid paying child support.

The defense contends the boy could
have contracted HIV in several ways,
including during a brief period while he
lived with three admitted drug users.
Stewart is expected to appeal.
WASHINGTON — Michael
Hufﬁngton says he’s gay.

The Washington Post says the
California millionaire who spent $28
million in an unsuccessful U.S. Senate
bid comes out of the closet in upcoming
magazine article for Esquire magazine.

David Brock, the article’s author,

says Hufﬁngton first raised the issue of
his sexual orientation while visiting
Brock’s home in Rehoboth Beach, Del.,
last Memorial Day weekend.

The 51-year-old Huffington and
conservative columnist Arianna
Hufﬁngton were divorced last year after
11 years of maniage, during which they
had two children. Brock wrote that
Hufﬁngton told his wife of his past
homosexual activity when they were
engaged.

Hufﬁngton, then a Republican con-.
gressman, lost a Senate race against
incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein,
despite pouring $28 million of his own
money into the effort.

WASHINGTON — Congress is
preparing to take the next step in the
impeachment process, but there’s no
consensus on what the outcome will be.

The House Judiciary Committee is
set to consider articles of impeachment
against President Clinton this week.
Chairman Henry Hyde wants to have a
vote by Saturday after giving Clinton’s
lawyers a chance to present a defense.

The Diamondback

COLLEGE PARK, Md. (U-
WIRE) — In an effort to promote the
capabilities of robots in space travel,
researchers from the University of

Maryland Neutral Buoyancy
Research Facility are currently
developing a robot, known as

Ranger, that will simulate human
activity.

“The intent behind building
Ranger is to create a robot that is
capable of completing any task that a
human can do,” said David Akin, an
associate professor of aerospace
engineering. “This project is
arguably the most advanced that is
designed for space.”

A staff of more than 30 students,
staff and faculty have worked on the
project for the past six years. The
projected completion date is set for
the end of 2000, Akin said. The name
Ranger, unlike the common
acronyms that denote space projects,
signifies the exploration of new terri-

.tory, Akin said.

Funded by NASA, the $8 million
project, a meager price-by space pro-
ject standards, is the leading project
in NASA’s telerobotics program, said
Russ Howard, chief engineer of the
project.

The group developed Ranger to
duplicate the complexity of a human.
It is capable of performing the basic
tasks of an astronaut, Akin said. The
robot is composed of four manipula-
tors, which include two multi-func-
tional legs and dexterous arms.
Ranger’s head will be a camera that
has the ability to photograph from
several perspectives.

“Because we do not have the
technology to duplicate the dexterity
of the human hand, we have
equipped the hands with five inter-
changeable parts,” Akin said.

Ranger will utilize tools and
interfaces to the same extent that an
astronaut can.

Although Ranger’s mission has
not been developed, Akin said the
robot will ﬂy aboard the space shut-
tle Columbia after Ranger is com-
pleted in 2000. The robot’s comput-

erized system will be controlled by
the astronauts aboard the space shut-
tle, as well as campus researchers
who will be stationed at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, Texas.

“The goal of Ranger is not to
repair anything but instead to demon-
strate its capabilities,” Howard said.
“Ranger will have impact on the
design of satellites in the future.”

While in orbit, Ranger is expect-
ed to perform several tasks in coop-
eration with the astronauts, Howard
said. Primarily, Ranger will attempt
to remove a section of the Hubble
Space Telescope and simulate replac-
ing it. The robot will also endeavor
to replace a circuit breaker box on
the International Space Station, he
said.

In addition to the project’s over-
all goal of promoting the capabilities
of robots in space travel, Howard
said this project will influence the
design of future satellites so that they
are accessible to repairs by robots as
well as astronauts.

“We’re on the cutting edge of
technology,” Howard said.

Motorcycle helmets should
not be enforced by low

Pennsylvania motorcyclists
may finally, legally have the
choice to have the wind rushing
through their hair.

A repeal of the law mandat-
ing helmet use for bikers over
the age of 21 has been passed by
both the state House and Senate
and is awaiting the decision of
Gov. Tom Ridge.

The Alliance of Bikers
Aimed Toward Education, a
group that has lobbied for the
repeal of the helmet law for the
past 30 years, has said the use of
helmets should not be enforced.

The choice of wearing a hel-
met should lie with the individ-
ual motorcyclist, not the govem-
ment. All motorcyclists, not just
those over the age of 21, should
have that choice.

Wearing a motorcycle hel-
met is obviously the safe choice,
as is the use of condoms. But the
use of condoms is not enforced.
Personal safety should be up to
the individual concerned even if
the use of a helmet means the
difference between life and
death.

If a helmetless biker’s bike
accidentally skids on an oily
road surface, throws him into

oncoming traffic and bounces
him off a car, then the difference
a helmet can make is minimal.
There are times when a helmet
can save lives, but statistically,
the number of bike accident
fatalities to reported accidents
ratio is the same in states with
motorcycle helmet laws and
states that don’t require helmets.
This supports ABATE’s argu-
ment that the use of a motorcycle
helmet really doesn’t make
much of a difference in a life-or-
death situation.

Of course, statistics by both
the pro- and anti-helmet law
camps can be used to serve their
purpose. Whatever the numbers,
no amount of legislation should
be used to force bikers to put
helmets on their melons.

Dr. Laurence J. Gavin, a
Philadelphia emergency medi-
cine specialist, said in an inter-
view in the Pittsburgh Tribune-
Review that “the biggest beneﬁ-
ciaries of this repeal would be
recipients of organs from brain-
dead, helmetless cyclists.”

Just as those cyclists have a
choice to be organ donors, they
should have a choice to ride a
motorcycle without a helmet.

C urrent welfare reform is a failure

\VIth numerous articles recently in the main-
stream media claiming that welfare refonn is work-
ing, I’d like to put some facts into the picture to give
a realistic view that will deﬂate this claim.

Simple facts, like the fact that almost half those
who have left the welfare system in Pennsylvania
have not found work or that the Department of
Public Welfare has no clue how many of those who
have found work have managed to keep those jobs.
The department loses track of former welfare recip-
ients once they exit the system and is unable to say
whether they have reached any level of sufﬁciency.
Yet somehow, it claims that anyone who leaves
welfare is better off!

Then there are those sanctions, which stop wel-
fare assistance to people who don’t comply with the
program’s requirements. You get three in a lifetime,
and then you’re out. More than halfthe people sanc-
tioned for the ﬁrst time in Pennsylvania have had
their sanctions last more than 180 days.

The rules, by the way, say 30 days for M [Sc-HA

the ﬁrst sanction. The “good” news is
that most sanctions are unnecessary and
are overturned if they are appealed. The
bad news is that most people don’t
know this and don’t appeal — and you only have
10 days in which to appeal sanctions. More than
1,500 families in the Pittsburgh area have already
been sanctioned.

Community service is still not deﬁned four
rnontlts before it is expected to ﬁll the “work activ-
ity” requirement for thousands in this county alone.
While the free labor will help nonproﬁt organiza-
tions and church groups, it strikes many church
leaders as modernized slavery.

The work requirement is indeed odd Baby-sit-
ting someone else’s kids is work if you get paid
Raising your own kids isn’t considered work, and
those who choose to stay home and watch their chil-
dren are called froeloaders. Does this strike anyone
as logical?

Thenagain,logicwasnotpartofeithertlIe
Democratic or Republican party plan. Previously,
what was the main way to get off welfare? Marriage
and reconciliation, not employment. Why did a sup-
posodly “family values”-oriented Republican Party
not make this the focus of the legislation? Isn’t rais-

A ing your kids pro-farnily? Then again, right-wingers

are supposedly religious, yet they ignore the
prophet lsaiah’s wish to protect the fatherless, and
they have ignored arguments against welfare
reform ﬁorn religious lawmakers such as Tony Hall

GELMAN

and criticism from many church groups.

One Pitt News columnist recently explained
this “logic” by citing the old adage that if you give
a person a ﬁsh, he can eat for a day, while if you
teach him to ﬁsh, he can eat for a lifetime. The prob-
lem is this: There aren’t enough ﬁshing poles for
people to use. Economists — who, unlike politi-
cians, must deal with reality —— freely admit unem-
ployment is a necessity and never will everybody
have jobs. That’s why we have, or had, something
called a safety net.

We must remember why this program began
— to help kids. Yet now children have been taken
out of ﬂre program title and out of the spotlight.
What about them? Do conservatives such as
President Clinton and the Republicans want a return
to child labor? Or is creating latchkey kids and tele-
vision baby-sitters (by forcing mom to work) their
intended aim? One wonders how they can claim

such legislation.

The ﬁrst step of the welfare
reform program is the eight-week job
search. Thankfully, many have found
(and kept) work and independence due
to this. The problem is that many haven’t. Why not?
There aren’t jobs out there, as many non—welfarc
recipients in the Steel Valley know.

The limit for receiving welfare is ﬁve years in
a  This, of course, leaves many groups out
in the wind Crippled and can’t work? Too bad.
Mentally ill? No reason for being dependent on the
government, say folks like Clinton and Newt
Gingrich. Are you a 79-year-old grandmother? Too
bad, lazybum! Goto work! In school trying to bet-
ter yourself? Tough luck — go ﬂip burgers for a liv-
ing! Is this a step in the right direction, toward self-
suﬂiciency?

Thenagamlhavebeenharshincallingthis
policy conservative. Some conservative critics,
such as Lawrence Mead, never once soft on wel-
fare, have said it went too far to the right.

The best summary of welfare reform I’ve seen
was from former Sen. Bill Bradley. He concluded
that the law is “a politician’s dream, a poor person’s
nightmare and a continuing source of anger and
frustration for the taxpaying public that wants real
welfare reform.”

Amen. '

I may be spoiled, but at least I share

Stephen -May

Columnlst

I didn’t ask to be born, but I was born,
and my parents did a good job of spoiling
me. I wasn’t spoiled in the “he’s a spoiled
brat” sense, but I was spoiled in that when-
ever I wanted something, I got it.

I guess the difference between being a
spoiled brat and being spoiled«is-that when
you’re a spoiled brat, you get whatever you
want when you want it. When you’re just
spoiled, you have to wait until Christmas or
your birthday. Of course, if you’re a spoiled
brat, you’re also spoiled. It’s like rectangles
and squares: A square is rectangle, but a rec-
tangle is by no means a  But I
digress. . . V, N N “
When I think “brat,” I think of Veruca
Salt (“Daddy, I ‘want an Ompa Lumpa
now!”) from  and the Chocolate

live a few houses down the street from me.
And I’m certainly not like them. I know you

young Miss Cramer was, "so I’ll provide you
with an example of her brattiness._

One day, Julie decided that she -and I

routine, which involved singing and danc-

“routine” took aboutanhourtotapebecause
every time Julie messed up, said the wrong
word, or whatever, she had to start over
again. Not only was Julie a spoiled brat, but
she was also a perfectionist.

Anyway, I assumed that when my turn

no, Julie wouldn’t let

but it is a problem for some people.

I work in the current periodicals room
inHi]lmanLibrar=y on Sunday nights. Inthe
current periodicals room, the day’s newspa-
pers are set out on the front desk, and library
patrons are free to take whichever paper
they want, sit down, and read.

But the problem is that we have only
one copy of each paper.
And it always seems to
be the case that ﬁve
patrons decide simulta-
neously that they
absolutely need to read
the day’s Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette. And of
course, some poor,
thrifty soul who came
all the way from the

' suburbs by bus to read
the newspapers for ﬁee in Hillman Library
is already struggling to read that very same
copy of the Post—Gazette with a cracked
magnifying glass-

Just the other night, there was a prob-
lem because one man was reading the
Washington Post and another man wanted
to extract the “Sunday Magazine” portion of
said paper so that he could photocopy the

crossword puzzle. This sounds like a very
easily solved problem. Just let the cross-
word man get what he wants, and get back
to reading, right? Wrong.

The crossword man didn’t ask nicely
enough and, consequently, had to wait until
thereaderwas donereadingtogethiscrack
at the Post. And the reader took his time. I
can understand how “sharing” the newspa-
per can be a little bit of a pain, but it’s the
library, an institution built on sharing.

If you don’t want to be bothered by a
crossword man while reading the newspa-
per in the library, I suggest you take all the
change in your pockets — the change you
deﬁnitely didn’t share with the drug-addict-
ed panhandlers on Forbes Avenue —— and
buy yourself a copy of the newspaper.
Newspapers were pretty cheap the last time
Ichecked. ‘

And when you’re done reading the
newspaper, you can use it for other things.
My mom used our old newspapers to line
the bottom of our parakeet’s cage. Back
when we had a parakeet. Back when I was
a boy. Back when the real-life incarnation of
Veruca Salt lived a few houses down the
street from me.

Stephen May realizes that you don’t care
about his childhood or the library or defen-
estration or anything else he is written about.

Bob Jones University: the dark sideof Christian higher education

Michael J. Mazza

columnlst

If you surf the Intemet and go to
www.bju.edu, you will come to the impres-
sive homepage of Bob Jones University, a
Christian school located in Greenville, S.C.
BJU’s impressive array of online material
presents it as a model Christian university.
As its mission statement proclaims,
“\Vrthin the cultural and academic soil of
liberal arts education, Bob Jones University
exists to grow Clrrist-like character that is
Scripturally disciplined, others-serving,
God-loving, Christ-proclairning, and
focused above.”

Since its founding as Bob Jones
College in 1927, BJU has grown into a full
university that offers more than 150 majors
to more than 5,000 students each year. BJU
certainly sounds like a success story in the
arena of Christian education, but this suc-
cess has a negative side.

One thing that the school’s Web page
does notboastaboutsoreadily is BJU’sban
on interracial dating among the student
body. In fact, this racist policy cost BJU its
tax-exempt status in the 1970s.

Amazed that a major Christian univer-

' sity could still cling to such out-moded

beliefs in the 1990s, I wrote to BJU seeking
clariﬁcation of its policies a couple of years
ago. Dan Seibert, who served BJU as com-
munity relations coordinator at that time,
graciously sent me an oﬁicial response on

June 21, 1996. In his letter, he explained
why BJU does indeed prohibit interracial
dating among its students.

Seibert informed me that “the whole

_planofGodasHehasdealtwiththeraces

down the ages indicates that interracial
maniage is not best for man.” He cited the
biblical story of the Tower of Babel
(Genesis 11) as an example of “a man glo-
rifying unity which God has not ordained.”

Not surprisingly, BJU views .homosex-
uality with the same horror that it does
interracial love. The school’s intolerance of
homosexuality affects not only its students,
but also alumni. In fact, the Ohio newspa-
per Gay Peoples Chronicle reported on
Oct. 30 that BJU had sent out a letter con-
cerning this topic to its alumni on Oct. 22.
The letter threatened that any gay alumni
who attempted to visit the campus would
be arrested.

BJU’s malodorous blend of racism,
homophobia and Christian fundamentalism
is certainly not unique in American culture.
Nevertheless, this school must be an enig-
ma to those progressive Christians who
worship in congregations that welcome and
value both interracial couples and same-sex
couples.

Perhaps some insight into the BJU
mentality can be gained by perusing the
pages of BJU Review, the school’s slick,
full-color quarterly magazine. A recent
series of columns by BJU graduates who
havereturnedtoteachattheschoolispar-

ticularly instructive.

In the winter 1997 issue of BJU
Review, ‘92 alum Greg Kielrneyer wrote of
the parallel between BJU and ancient
Israel: “Just as God" miraculously estab-
lished Israel in the promised land, so God
also miraculously established BJU.” To the
true believers, BJU is not just any Christian
school; lt_‘iS God’s own special fortress
against the corrupt modern world. _g _ A

Jotm Matthews, an ‘89 alum, also
defended BJU in the summer 1998 issue:

as a violation of biblical standards. Echoing
the rhetoric of BJU’s spokesmen, Vorster
declared the following in 1970:
“Our only guide is the Bible. Our poli-

cy and outlook on life are based on the
Bible. We fnrnly believe the way we inter-
pret it is right. We will not budge one inch
from our interpretation to satisfy anyone in
South Aﬁica or abroad. The world may dif-
fer from our interpretation. This will not
inﬂuence us. The world may be wrong.”

He concludes, “We are right and will
continue to follow the way the Bible teach-
es.”

The administrators of BJU are certain-
ly entitled to their beliefs; I defend their
right to voice their beliefs, and I further
defend their right to run their private school
the way they see ﬁt. Nevertheless, I reserve
my right to critique them.

Like so many other Christians today.
the leaders of BJU pluck a handful of
selected verses out of the Bible in order to
justify their own fears and prejudices. They
claim to follow the Bible; all they are fol-
lowing is their own ﬂawed humanity.

In their attempts to build up a Bible-
centered utopia — an exclusive principali-
ty whose gates keep out both interracial
couples and same-sex couples — the lead-
ers of BJU have totally missed Jesus’ cen-
tral message of love and inclusiveness.
They have rejected his life-afﬁrming gospel
in favor of a false gospel of arrogant big-
otry.

Green Wave swept
under rug by Bowl
Championship Series

Last-second collapses by Kansas
State and UCLA on Saturday turned
the inaugural edition of the Bowl
Championship Series into the
Tennessee Volunteers Admiration
Society.

The Vols are the only good team
left, said the selection formula.
They’re undefeated, they’ve won a
major conference title, and they’re
tops in the polls.

If you’re a Tennessee fan, this new
BCS system is the coolest thing since
the last time you toured Graceland.
The proponents of this new formula
promised an accurate ranking of the
nation’s top college squads, and the
sucker delivered — whoever wins the
Fiesta Bowl deserves the national title.

It’s a fine setup, with one minor
ﬂaw —— the new ranking system forgot
Tulane.

A system engineered to design a
national championship game between
the nation’s top two Division I squads
omitted the 11-0 Tulane Green Wave,
a team that did everything in its power
to earn a bowl bid but lost, thanks to
the formula and the general insanity
surrounding the year—ending ﬂurry of
college football.

Oh, speaking of Graceland, the
Green Wave will attempt to improve
their undefeated record against
Brigham Young (9-4) in the Liberty
Bowl.

Pitt fans may remember that the
Liberty Bowl is played in Memphis,
Elvis’ hometown. They may also
remember that the bowl ranks at or
near the bottom of the postseason slate
and that it normally features a
matchup between the Conference
USA champions (i.e., Tulane) and a
high-profile victim (BYU or the 1997
Pitt Panthers).

The payoff for playing in
Memphis on New Year’s Day ranks
slightly behind the multimillion-dollar
purse of the BCS bowls on New Year’s
Eve. Because Tulane has an agreement
as C-USA champion and it did not ﬁn-
ish at the tip-top of the BCS standings,
it is doomed to finish the football sea-
son BCS — Beneath Champion
Status.

Sure, C-USA doesn’t often pro-
duce championship-caliber football
teams, but the fact remains: The new-
fangled title formula failed to match

“I thought the band was great.”

Those were the words of Pitt
coach Ralph Willard after his team’s
win over Prairie View A&M.

The Pitt basketball team that
showed up in Puerto Rico to play
Maryland returned for an encore in
that game Thursday night against the
Prairie View Panthers, but the lack-
luster and unemotional effort put
forth against Prairie View was good
enough for a 78-64 win.

Following the game, sophomore
swingman Ricardo Greer said, “We
can’t go with that attitude to
Tennessee, or we’ll get killed.”

The Panthers didn’t play nearly
as badly against Tennessee, but the
outcome was a 56-53 loss to the
Volunteers, who were just outside the
top-25 polls last week and will most
likely enter them this week.

Pitt, after losing to the Vols,
moved up to No. 18 in the
ESPN/USA Today coaches’ poll.

 

SEAN PATRSCK BRADY/ SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Isaac Hawkins has been the most
consistent Panther this year with
double-doubles in his last two games.

The differ-
ence in the game
was Tennessee’s
interior defense,
which registered
a school—record
15 blocked shots.
Despite the mon-
strous frontcourt,
Pitt continually
attacked the
paint instead of
shooting from
the outside.

That didn’t ‘
work very well,
either as Pitt fol-
lowed a shooting
night of 35 per-
cent against
Prairie View
with a 31-percent
effort against the
Volunteers.

Pitt was only
8—of-34 from the
floor in the sec-
ond half and was
only 7-of-20 from behind the three-
point line for the game, which pre-
vented Pitt from sustaining momen-
tum in a game where its biggest lead
was only three points.

In the Prairie View A&M game, ‘

the only player to show any type of
emotion was Isaac Hawkins, who got
his usual double—double by leading
Pitt in scoring with 22 points and
adding a team-high 17 rebounds.

“Isaac played great tonight. .
That’s about it,” said Pitt coach
Ralph Willard after Thursday’s
game.

Willard could have said the same
words after yesterday’s game.
Hawkins led the team again with 20
points and 13 rebounds, seven of
which came at the offensive end. In
fact, the team as a whole had 19
offensive rebounds but converted on
less than half of them, which con-
tributed to the poor shooting percent-
age.
“That’s a great effort stat, but the
problem was [that] we didn’t reward
our effort,” Willard said.

The Panthers have been troubled
by Vonteego Cummings’ perfor-
mances. In the Prairie View game, he
shot only 3-of-14 from the field and
for 10 points.

In fact, the game’s top point
guard played for Prairie View — all
5—foot—8 of him. True freshman

PHER

 

Vonteego Cummings has not lived up to all of the hype
this year, but is still expected to lead Pitt.

Gregory Burks played a gutsy 35
minutes in that time, scoring seven
points and notching five assists while
committing only two turnovers
against Pitt’s pressure defense.

In ‘ the Tennessee game,
Cummings scored 11 points but had
only three assists and committed
seven turnovers for the Panthers,
who only had nine assists while giv-
ing the ball away 20 times.

“He has to have the mentality
going into the game that he has
offensive help,” Willard said about
Cummings. “His shots have to come
in the flow of the ball game.”

Cummings fouled out with more
than two minutes remaining against
Tennessee.

An even bigger disappointment
to the team was Attila Cosby, who
scored his first points with less than
five minutes remaining in the game
and then fouled out on the ensuing
defensive trip for Pitt.

“He has to start playing aggres-
sively. He’s too passive,” Willard
said of Cosby.

Tennessee was led by sophomore
sensation Tony Harris, who scored
17 points in 35 minutes of play. Also
contributing were Charles Hathaway,
who poured in 11 points, and C.J.
Black, who had five of the team’s 15

Women lose to cross-town

Joe Carmody

Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
team suffered through a cold shoot-
ing night in its loss to cross—town
rival Duquesne.

The Lady Panthers got off to a
slow start, and the Dukes made their
shots when they had to as Duquesne
held off Pitt, 65-58, in the annual
Pittsburgh clash.

The loss dropped Pitt’s record to
4-2 overall before it begins Big East
action, while Duquesne remained
undefeated at 6-0 heading into its
Atlantic-10 play.

Four minutes into the game, the
Panthers trailed the Dukes 16-2.
Duquesne made many transition bas-
kets, which kept the Panthers trail-
ing throughout the game.

But the Lady Panthers climbed
right back into the contest behind the
rebounding and inside scoring of

Kortni Webb, who finished the game
with the first double—double of her
career, had 11 points and 11
rebounds.

Despite the early deficit, the
Panthers continued to pick at the
Dukes’ steady lead. On three sepa-
rate occasions, they cut the lead to
three.

The final scoring run came with
Michelle Katkowski’s three-pointer
with 1:01 remaining, which made
the score 57-54.

That was the closest Pitt would
come in the closing minutes because
Duquesne guard LynneDee Howell
hit clutch free throws to secure the
victory for the Dukes. Howell fin-
ished the night with a game-high 20
points and was 12-of-16 from the
charity stripe.

“She plays ugly, but she gets it
done,” said Pitt coach Traci Waites
of Howell. “She’s a great penetrator,

blocks.

The Volunteers committed 22
turnovers themselves but were able
to capitalize on their opportunities.
Their biggest lead was five points,
which came in the second half on
three different occasions, the last at
51-46.

Willard and the Panthers have a
week of crucial games coming up.

“We have two monster games
coming up with UConn and St.
John’s,” Willard said after the
Tennessee game. “It’s certainly a
great challenge, and I’m sure the
guys are looking forward to it, and
we just have to strap it up and go
after it.”

Pitt's 1998 All-‘Stair team won Regional Tournament and repre-

COLUMN

two undefeated teams in the national
championship game.

If it can happen to the winners of
Conference USA, then it could happen
to someone else. .

Any undefeated team in a minor
conference can be easily overlooked
by the BCS. Final records can be
ignored in favor of -strength—of—sched-
ule statistics. Teams with two losses
can be ranked ahead of teams with
none — it happened this year, as Texas
A&M and Florida each ﬁnished ahead
of the Green Wave despite two blem-
ishes on each of their records.

Florida State, a team with one
loss, will challenge for the NCAA title
in the Fiesta Bowl this January, facing
the Volunteers. FSU coach Bobby
Bowden, father of departing Tulane
coach Tommy Bowden (he left for
Clemson; if you had an undefeated
season and didn’t get to play in the
title game, wouldn’t you bolt?),
addressed this very mess when asked
about his son.

Bobby said that Tommy deserved
a shot at a championship, “but because
of the schedule and other things at
Tulane, that’s not as possible.”

Not as possible?

The Green Wave won all but one
of their games by double—digit mar-
gins, with a 28-22 victory over
Louisville serving as the only excep-
tion.

The ll-game win list includes a
72-20 demolition of Southwestern
Louisiana and a 63-30 blowout victory

mom PAGE 7

over Louisiana Tech in the last game ’

of the season.

The Green Wave bested Southern
Mississippi, 21-7, downing the
defending conference champions.

In their one swipe at a major con-
ference opponent, they visited the
swamps of New Jersey and pounded
the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers, 52-24.

If it were possible for Tulane to
earn a BCS berth, Tommy Bowden’s
team would have done it this season.

No matter how pristine this new
system looks to the formula designers
or to Tennessee fans, it eliminated
Tulane from consideration before the
season even started based on a poor
schedule, a poor conference and a lack
of respect in the national polls.

Even a Tennessee fan has to find
fault in a system like that. And a
Panther fan — already rooting for a
team in the struggling Big East and
boasting a weak out-of-conference
schedule — should be downright
scared.

Kevin Lilley is the senior football
writer for The Pitt News and doubts
that many Green Wave fans will
remember much of the Liberty Bowl
after spending the next evening on
Beale Street.
