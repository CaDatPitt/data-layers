Student Government Holds Banquet

Four Members
Given Service

,  Awards By SC

Tom Olofson was oﬁicially
installed aspresident of Stu-
dent Government Thursday
evening at the organization’s
annual banquet. .

The first speaker at the din-
ner was Richard Sobota, past pres-
identiof SG. His address was re-
ferred to as a combination fare-
well speech and state of SG mes-
sage. ,

“When I first started as presi-
dent of Student Government,” So-
bota said, “the Senate was plagued
with problems of attendance. This
hasn’t been solved yet, but the
new Senate structure should help.”

‘Concentrate on Externals’

Sobota added that although his
plan had .not been chosen in the
reorganization referendum, he felt
sure that “internal problems of
SG are now fixed. Now is the time
to start on external problems.”

The past president stated
that a demand of responsibility
must be created in the student
body, asthey “need more now
than ever before.” If 'SG can
evoke the interest of the stu-
dents, he added, then it can sup-
ply their demands.

As advice to the new Senators,
Sobota suggested that they “oper-
ate as a group, working at single
goals . . . for the material beneﬁt
of the students.”

Presents Awards

Sobota then concluded his ad-
dress by presenting SG Service
Awards to Bob Slotkin, Ray Reav-
es, Mary Alice Polyak and Sam
Zacharias.

After accepting the gavel in
the swearing-in ceremony, Tom
Olofson made a brief speech
which he said could have the
possible title /“Leadership With-
in and By SG.” »

He stated first that “it's not true
that the University needs no Stu-
dent Government. However,” he
added, “we do not need an inef-
ficient Student Government.”

‘Give Direction’
Olofson then outlined what he

, considered the main tenets of re-

sponsibility of leadership. Primar-
ily, he stated that it was the job
of SG to motivate themselves and
the student body. In the same line,
he said that it was the job of SG
to “give proper direction to the
student body.”

He then added that “Student
Government must be strong and
respected and must have=dedi-
cated members.” He also pointed
out that the members of SG
must be. aware of everything
that ocurs on campus and form-
ulate well-chosen opinions on all
aspects of University life.

15 Foreign Correspondents L
To Visit University for Talks

By VIJAY JAIN ,

A group of ﬁfteen correspondents of foreign newspapers,
press, and radio services will visit the university for ten
days starting April 2. The group will hold seminars and
discussions with Americans in varied ﬁelds and also with

University students.

The program is sponsored
the University. The program
Pittsburgh Council for Interna-
tional Vistiors and will be admin-”
istered by the Oﬁice of Cultural
and Educational Exchange.

The purpose or the seminar is
to provide an opportunity for the-
foreign correspondents, w h o s e
combined audience totals over 110
million people, to explore with
Americans, in conversation and
discussion, the most salient char-
acteristics of our national society.

Home Visits

Visits to industry and American
homes will give illustration of
American life and give them a
deeper insight into American pat-
terns of life.

The day long seminars,wil|
discuss and deal with the fol-
lowing sectors of American So-
ciety: Characteristics of the so-
cial structure; the role of the
ethic and minority groups; the
dynamics of the economy; la-
bor force in American life; the
political p r o c e s s American
myths and values. '

The discussions will be in an
informal atmosphere in order to
achieve a frank and genuine un-
derstanding. An American con-
sultant will open each session
with a brief introductory state-
ment of the subject. A

New Student Affairs    

Group Organizes

A calendar of major events, a social handbook, stand-
ards of eligibility for organization officers, and general con-
sideration of the policies of dormitory life are only a few
of the areas which will occupy the newly organized Student
Affairs Committee in the coming month. A

At their ﬁrst meeting of the year last Thursday, the

thirteen-man committee reorgan-9

ized under plans drawn up in
1957 under the then assistant
chancellor of Student Affairs, Dr.
Charles H. Peake.

The committee dissolved itself
last April due to lack of participa-
tion of its members.

Major difficulty facing this
year’s advisory team was defini-
tion of purpose. The six students
and seven faculty members and
administrators present felt that the
terms submitted by the Chancellor
four years ago were somewhat
vague and contradictory in nature.
They also felt that many of the
responsibilities overlapped with
those accorded other existing
groups on campus such as Student
Government, and the dormitory
judiciary councils.

One of those areas was in the
recognition of newly-formed
student organizations. The ques-
tion arose when it was found
that four political groups on.
campus had no official Univer-
sity recognition. In statement
outlining the policies and pro-
cedures of governing student or-
ganizations, all groups are clas-
sified into eight general cate-
gories. ~

The majority of these categor-
ies fall under the jurisdiction of
Student Government. By those
which are considered extensions
of curricular or departmental pro-
grams of the University; profes-
sional, recognition and honorary
organizations related to academic
and professional ﬁelds within the
University; and departmental or
inter-departmental sponsored fac-
ulty—student discussion groups are

WPDU  Meets C

The William Pitt ,Debating
Union ended a three-day series of
debates with Cornell University
Friday at a special Midday Series
presentation in the SU Ballroom.

The teams discussed the topic

“Resolved: That the House Com-

mittee on Un—American Activities

should be Abolished.” Cornell un- ,

dergraduates Nancy Rosen and
Alan Berkeley argued the positive
and the WPDU’s Larry Profant
and Alan Cazen took the negative.

Speaking first, Miss Rosen slat-
ed that there existed
Constitutional, legal and logical
reasons why the HUAC should not
exist.” Primarily, she pointed out
that her side believed the organi-
zation was violating its own man-
date. as‘ well as the first, fifth,

“several

ninth and fourteenth Amendments 

to the Constitution.

Profant later countered in sum-
mation by stating that “Not only
is the HUAC a legal organization,

V  ,|'{'ockwe||s Right
"To Speak Questioned

’ Editor, The Pitt News:

LI am questioning George Lin-
coln Rockwell’s “right” to speak.

_» True, the Bill Of Rights guaran-

tees ‘freedom of speech. The Con-
stitution, however, as interpreted
by the Supreme Court, says free-
dom of speech is not a right, but
a-privilege, a privilege which may
be denied when it endangers pub-
lic health} safety or morals.

By continued -speaking Rock-
well V endangers all three. I-Iis

speeches often lead to violence.-

This is unhealthy and unsafe.
'Roc"kwel1’s race theory advocates
the murder of citizens, and denies
the American ideals: democracy,
equality, and brotherhood. Thus
he imperils public welfare. _

~ Some students say Rockwell
can’t hurt us. The fact is, Rock-
well can hurt u_s. Would “Pitt stu-
dents attack ‘ George Rockwell”
beneﬁt the University’s reputa-
tion? Even if he weren’t attacked

A ~ —-and I think he would be —— he

would reap enormous propaganda
value from an invitation to -speak
at a large university. This is what
he wants. . 1

, Thestudents should not feel de-
'prived of. an opportunity to hear
Rockwell. I heard him last year
in New York. He built his lies on

4 fear and ignorance; his goals were ‘
V bigotry and hatred. Before he ﬁn-

ished speaking the police led him

away for his own protection. If‘

the students want to learn about
Nazism let them read “Mein
Kampf,”— or better yet, let them
read “Seven Chimneys” or “The
Scourge of the Swastika.” Here is
the truth.

Foreign Forum No. -12 

 The Un-Committe

 

.'

‘«;‘. "

By Viiay Jain, India

‘understanding of the roots of the

The foreign aid bill has been sent to Congress
and, as usual, it has created a controversy. The
press and congressmen are questioning the advis-
ability of spending billions of dollars on countries
which do not stand up to be counted with them
when the time comes and,
though they claim to be “neu-
trals,” they invariably show a
preference for the “un—Ameri-
can” way of life. They feel that
aid with no “strings” attached
seems to be failing. ,

One of my Americangfriends,
whenever" he wished to register
his dissatisfaction at something -
I did or said, would say with
mock seriousness, “cut off all the
foreign aid and ship all foreign-
ers to where theyrcame from.” This seems to be

 

I the attitude of most of the congressmen and quite

a few- Americans as well. V

I cannot presume to speak for all the non-align-
ed nations, nor even‘ for my ownlcountry, but it
seems to me that these critics are being unfair to
themselves as well as to the nations in question. .

I hope and expect that aid is given to the under-
developed continues primarily to “help the less for-
tunates raise their standard of living” rather than to
“buy” their friendship, for friendship cannot be
bought and having made this good Christian gesture‘
they should hope for no more than that their aid
has been timely and of use to the recipient; it has

’ been said “give not in expectation of something in

return” and aid without “strings” attached en-
tails this. I "
Matter of Conscience

It hurts, I know, to think that after giving all
the aid you have a thankless friend, but consider
for a moment that, inspite of being a friend, he
may not ﬁnd it possible to support the U.S. stand

’ on an. issue because it isagainst the dictates of his

conscience.

Again, -were theretoebe only ‘two faction, the
decision on any issue would go in favor of the one
with a larger faction‘, irrespective of whetherit is
right or wrong. The unaligned nations, by siding
with one or the other, provide a buffer and a
t.hought-provoking group and determine the course

ited group than from a block which does what the;

eration” the US. might expect they expect also.*Ati'n

of action. I do not say that they may always make
the right decision, for man is not infallible,but
there is less chance of error from the uncommit.

“big brother” or “Uncle Sam” thinks should be

done. L
There have been times when the U.S. “deserted”

its allies and voted with the Reds —— Portugese “

possession of Angola is a recent example. This does‘?
not mean that America has forsaken a friend but
that it could not reconcile and support someone it
considered to ‘be in wrong. ;
Another point that i.s of some importance is the

the U.S. “Block” is also "receiving. aid from the;
Soviet “Block” and whatever “favors” of .“consid-

the risk’ of being branded pro-communist, I may.
say that, to my knowledge, Russia has not e3;_presSéd~'_
“regret” at helping a nation that voted againstthyemf
on an issue. . ”
Both End Against Middle? . - ,

At this point you may say, “Well, the neutral-st“
nations are playing both ends against the midd1e,?’,,;
Not so, because when seeking help for a worth--
while cause, and I think improving one’s nations is.»

‘worthwhile, one does not ask who is giving or how  _

much or what his intentions‘ are, but takes what-’

‘ever one gets and thanks the donor. The donor

should not ask for a favor in “trade” and the re-
cipient should not do a favor because he feels
obligated, for then it is not charity but payment
and this degrades both the donor and the recipient.
As to the effectiveness of aid to elevate the suff-
ering, Lndia with a democratically elected govern- .
ment is about on a par with Red China which has
channeled government resources into the areas
thought to be in the best interest of the nation.
The U.S. has to decide how much,’ to whom,
and in whatform, but those who decoy “throwing”
money abroad should bear‘ in mind that the aid
given abroad comes back as subsidies for the in-
dustry by creating more demand for certain com-
modities and thus helps employ some of the work-
less. I, for one, long with many others’, would not
be here to study were not exchange available and

iwould not yearly spend nearly $4,090 here that was

earned by my father in India.

As France seems to be moving toward a tragic
climax that will see its effects

The Algerian Moslem rebel-

But if the rupture of colonies from England

to be the strongest on the continent, and her Magi-

Easy Defeat

But the Nazi Blitzkreig of May and June 1940
showed that the facts differed greatly from the
image. Even worse, instead of ﬁghting to the end,
the French signed an armistice with the Germans,

the France of Lafayette’s and Robespierre’s revolu- e

tion now had a government that cooperated with
the Nazis. ‘

France’sinationalism was seriously wounded,
and it was reﬂected in DeGaulle’s relation with
Roosevelt and Churchill during the war. His ob-
stinance was not merely a personal characteristic;
he had to prove to the Allies that France was

still the France of 1918.

And in August 19.44, -De Gaulle led the victori-
ous Allies in their traditional; march through the
Arc de Triumphe. If he wasn’t able to ‘convince
the Allies that allthat was necessary to restore
France to her old greatness was winning the war,
he was able to persuade" a large number of French-
men of this.

And thus, the urgency of keeping her colonies
after the war was more than a matter of economics

French pride. A similar display of this attitude
was the French development of the" atomic bomb

an astute politician, and he realized that Algeria
could not be held. Thus the defender of— “French

Most colons (French settlers) e can be expected

“It Goes On

  

LES MISERABLES

Saturday was a holiday of sorts for that fanatic breed

V-thatdigests basketballs like they were “pop” pills. The pic-

nic began at 2:00 p.m. when the Boston Celtics taught Wilt

,Chamberlain and his four playmakers from Philly how to

win in the NBA. ‘

At 4:00 the Dayton Flyers muffled long—armed Leroy
Ellis and his St. John compatriots, 73-67, to win the NIT
championship in Madison Squ-are Garden before nearly
18,000. '

A little later Uniontown and fabulous Don Yates exe-
cuted Norristown, and the perfect day was capped with
the biggest game of the winter season, the NCAA ﬁnale be-
tween Ohio State and Cincinnati. T
Memories Fade ‘ V

Watching these frantic contests, we thought about how
insigniﬁcant the rest of the season seemed compared to these
sizzling thrillers. Who remembered that UCLA had lost
seven of their ﬁrst 11 games this year when they were just
barely edged by Cincinnati by two points in the semi-
ﬁnals and the same margin in the consolations by Wake
Forest? i

‘Who recalled Duquesne’s loss to Westminster when
they fought their way so far in the NIT? Likewise who
remembered that Pitt beat Westminster when they
swept to second place in the NAIA, and were voted the
number one small college team in the country?

But one can’t dismiss the schedule as irrelevant for none
of the tournament teams would have left their campus sites
had they not won their share of regular campaign meetings.

Taking it for granted that Pitt’s basketball players
watched the games, it must have been a disheartening ex-
perience, the sort of feeling you get when you’re homesick.
No matter what the skeptics say, the NIT was deﬁnitely in-
terested in the sophomore-studded lineup of the Panthers
had they Won their last ﬁve games this year.

This is going to be a long hot summer, and if the

Pitt boys felt left out because they weren’t in a tourna-

wment, they should be honing their shooting eyes this va-
cation time. Dayton’s Bill Chmielewski was an All-

American player in high school in Detroit. Pitt’s Brian

Generalovich was one in Farrell, Pa. He is capable of

doing the same thing as the giant from Detroit.

Generalovich must smart when he sees his ol’ team-
mate Willie Somerset in the NIT, playing before millions
of people via television. The same is possible for Pitt next
year.

, A rabid Duquesne supporter tells me, that Duquesne
will “be hurtin’ a bit next year.” Well. the Dukes will still
post a better record than the Panthers did this season, and
they still won’t be satisﬁed. The Duke fan also said, “You
got the boys on your team for next year You should have a

a real good ball club, and if you don.’t go somewhere next

year, something’s wrong.”
Shooters Return ,

Next year the shooters will be back: Generalovich, Cal
Sheffield, Dave Sauer, and Ben Jinks. Let’s forget about get-
ting a big center for them by the time that they are seniors,
and work with‘ Paul Krieger. _ .

Krieger says he’s 6-7 now, and a friend tells us that he
dunked a ball last week overhead at the YMHA. ‘‘All he
needs is to build himself up,” the observer suggested.

not well at all. Jim, Harrison,
wrestling at 167 pounds, made the
best showing for the Cats by tak-
ing a third. while Daryl Ke1ving-
ton and Rich Martin finished
fourth..

Loses To Champion

Harrison surprisingly moved
into the semi-finals where he lost
to the eventual champion Ronnie
Clinton of Oklahoma State, 3-2.
He came back in the consolations
to best Minnesota's Jim Buffington
and Southern Ill.inois’s Don .Mi1-

Martin was upset in the semi-
finals by Frank Freeman of
Iowa State, 7-5. He was victor-
ious in his first consolation
match but was defeated in the
finals to finish fourth. '

The story on Kelvington was the
same as Martin. Lehigh’s Kirk
Pendleton’s surprising drop in
weight to 147 pounds spelled doom
for Kelvington in the semi-finals.
Pendleton quickly pinned Kelving-
ton at 1:29. Daryl won his initial
consolation match but lost the
next to also finish fourth.

Lose Openers

Tom Jeffries and Ken Barr both
lost in the opening round. John
Zolikoff, Pitt’s other entry, won
his first round match, but was de-
feated by Larry Janis of Miami,
Ohio in hisgnext outing.

Two king size upsets marked
thetournament. In a 147 pound
title match Pendelton was an
overwhelming choice to defeat
Army’s Mike Natvig. He had
crushed Natvig in the Eastern
final, 11-3 and was expected to
do the same again. But Natvig

IT

e Supsura Lone Catcher
On Cats Baseball Team

If Baseball Coach Bobby Lewis is overly concerned about
the physical condition of his regular catcher Mike Supsura,
it is with just cause. Supsura is the team’s only catcher and
if he is injured the diamondmen would be in serious trouble.
The scarcity of catchers is partly due tothe beginning of
spring football practice. Guard Tom Brown had been out for
catcher, but shifted to the grid sport when spring drills began.
Lewis is not sure if Brown is going to rejoin the team,
but even if he does it will probably not be until after the

M. .

 

‘dearth of backstops.
like Mike is; going to have to be.

May

baseball season has started.-
Another DeLost
Lewis is concerned over the
“It looks
another Fred DeLost,” he com-
mented. DeLost started every
game behind the plate in his three
year career.
Even if Supsura is successful
in catching every game includ-
ing the arduous task of play-

ing in, both ends of a double- .i

header, the lack of catching
will still be felt»

“We won’t have a catcher to
handle batting practice and to
warm. up the pitchers,” Lewis
notes. ‘‘It’s a big problem. I
guess we’ll. have to let the pitch-
ers warm up each other, I don’t
know what wc’re going to do
about batting practice.” y

Supsura, who will be _a junior
once the third trimester‘ begins,
earned the starting berth as
soon as he became eligible last

. year. He handled the brunt of
the catching and was relieved
by Tim Grgurich.

After a tough basketball sea»
son, Grgurich has decided to sit:
out baseball this year, but ex-
pects to be back next year.

It looks like everything will be

Students Polled On Neo—Nazis

By MATT SWETONIC

When the Student Union Board
announced its decision last week
not to invite George Lincoln Rock-
well, the commander of the Amer-
ican Nazi Party, to speak at the
University, many voices were rais-
ed around campus in favor of or
against this decision.

In an attempt to gain a cross-
census on this matter a number of
student leaders and faculty and
administrative personel were poll-
ed to discover their views con-
cerning the possibility of Rock-
well's coming here to speak.

The following were the results
of the poll. .

WPGH Comments

Daniel Johnson, news director of
WPGH: “I would be interested in
hearing him speak, because I have
heard many people discribe his
radicalism, and I would like to
see if he is as big a nut as they
say he is. I would also be curious
to see how” big a riot developed
during his appearance.”

Dr. William B. Crafts, dean
of Men: “Any person who is of
the same ilk as Rockwell or the
person who visited the campus
last week shouldn’t be allowed
to speak at the University for
any reason whatever.

“I can’t help but think that the
entire movement is most incom-
patible for a presentation at the
University. In contrast to the Uni-
versity goals of rationality, reason,
and objectivity, Rockwell would
throw any planned program on to
an emotional basis.

‘SU Board Decided Right’,

“The Student Union Board made
an excellent decision in the matter.
They were mindful and consider-
ed most carefully administrative
concerns such as: ridicule to the
University because of extreme
emotionalism and possible damage
to persons and property during
any demonstration.

“A Rockwell visit would serve
as a. fine educational opportun-
ity to consider the issues involv-
ed, however I hope that students
will be responsible enough to
weigh carefully the merits and
demerits of such a visit and

Dinner Slated

zation will sponsor a dinner for

sity since 1956.

come to the same sort of decis-
ion which the Boarc: did.

“However, it still remains a
student decision, but I would be
willing to advise and counsel any
group considering inviting him on
the interests of the University at
large concerning the matter.

Art Pape, president of Inter-
fraternity Council: “I don't see
how a visit from Rockwell
could hurt. However, I would
object inviting a man here just
to insult a good portion of the
student body.

“Such a visit would make a lot
of people sit up and take notice.
He has a right to come here and
speak if he is invited. In fact, I
would become frightened about
our faith and belief in America if
we were afraid to hear him speak
and talk with him.

Matter of Responsibility

“It is a part of the responsibility
of this institution to make this sort
of opporuniy available to the stu-
dents. And I don’t believe that
we’re going to prepetuate our way
of life by refusing to flex our in-
tellectual muscles in evaluating his
views.”

Dr. Thomas M. Cooley, II,
dean of the School of Law: “I
would not go and listen to him
speak, but I would strongly rc-
pel any attempts to prevent
him coming on campus.”

Mary Pat Thomas. president of
AWS: “I can see where students
would want to hear his views, but
might we not get the wrong idea
from his ideals. If students can
look at it objectively -then I be-

lieve that it is all right for him to I

     
 

speak, but if he is to be used
merely to stir up radicalism then
I would be against his coming on
campus.” 3

Irving N. Rothman, director of
Student Publications: “If a stu-
dent group invited Rockwell to
come on campus, I feel he should
be allowed to come. However, the
group must be assured that it is
doing so for intellectual curiosity
and not with pure sadistic intent,
for a university is the only re-
maining place in our society where
we can have an honest expression
of conviction.”

Dr. Robert G. Colodny, assis-
tant professor of history: “The
University has nothing to fear
from the ideas of any speaker,
FI‘€8d0ITl IS lI1dlVlSlble; you can...
not deprive a person you hate of
a freedom without depriving your-
self of an equal amount of the
same freedom. If the students wish
to hear him, it would be part of
their education to be able to do
so.”
