Workmen Labor
To Finish Library

Final Preparations Being Made
For Formal Opening Monday

With the opening date just a few
days ahead, next Monday, work is be-
ing rushed on the fourth, ﬁfth, and
Sixth ﬂoors of the Cathedral in prepa-
ration for the moving of the Univer-
sity Library from State Hall to the
new quarters.

Most of the work has been complet-
ed on the fourth and ﬁfth ﬂoors, and
furniture has been moved from stor-
age to the ﬁfth ﬂoor rooms. The sig-
nal lights in the delivery room have
been installed. Each student who
asks for a book will be given a num-
ber. \Vhen the book arrives his num-
ber appears in lights on a board at
the top of the book elevator.

Books from the Downtown Divis'on
library have been moved to the fourth
floor storage stacks. and most of the
less-used volumes from the State Hall
lLibrary will probably be moved today.

Vvood paneling in the Darlington
Memorial IRoom, the Alldred Memorial
lR.oom_ the Men’s Reading Room, and
the Women’s Reading Room has been
completed. In the Darlington cen-
tral room the walls have been com-
pletely covered by large walnut pan-
els and pillars.

Woodwork Harmonizes

In each of the eight alcove-rooms
of the Darlington Memorial, the wood-
work has been grained to harmonize
with the original Darlington furnish-
ings which pave been renovated and
placed in prominent positions.

The entrance to the Darlington
Room is through a domed alcove. On
one side will be a plaque with the
name of the donors and the dedica-
tion.

The Men’s Reading Room, the larg-
est of the group, is nearly completed
except for electrical equipment and a
part of the wood ﬂooring. Rooms will
be furnished for conferences and meet-
ings.

The rubber-tile ﬂooring has already
been laid in the Women’s Reading
Room. All radiators have wooden
built-in enclosures. The old wooden
elevator doors have been replaced by
the black enameled type.

The Alldred room will be ﬁnished in
green. The sidewalls will be done -ti
pale green and the shelving and other
woodwork will be painted a darker
shade.

Fixtures lnstalled

The electric ﬁxtures of the ﬁfth ﬂoor
have been hung. The chandeliers are
of sheet iron with glass insets around
the sides and a round glass panel at
the bottom. The ﬁxtures on the sixth
floor are of similar design except that
they are made of brass and have more
glass insets. -

Books being transferred had a ride
on the improvised slide that was con-
structed to take books from the fourth
ﬂoor of State Hall to the Alumni Hall
steps, thus avoiding delays on the
crowded steps.

University Band
To Play At Home
Concert Tonight

120 Pieces To Swing Into Action
With Sousa March; Goldman
Will Be Guest Leader

With the rendition of John Philip
Sousa’s rousing “Thunderer March,”
the University ROTC Band of 120
pieces will swing into its annual home
concert this evening at Carnegie Hall.

For its guest artist, the band will
present one of America’s greatest
band leaders," Dr. Edwin Franko
Goldman. Dr. Goldman is known to

the American musical public as a
composer, lecturer, and conductor of
the famous Goldman band, which an-
nually gives a series of summer con-
certs on the Mall in New York City‘.

Also, during his short stay at the
University, he will lead the band in
some short works at this morning’s
assembly in Syria Mosque. At the
concert this evening, Dr. Goldman
plans to lead the band in several of
his own marches, and in representa-
tive works by other composers.

Program Divided

For his part of the program, Lee M.
Lockhart, director of the band, has di-
vided the program into three sections:
theatrical, classical, and college works
and songs. It is contended that this
policy will enable everyone, whether
musical critic or layman, to enjoy the
concert.

Besides the regular type of sym-
phonic music, there are to be several
specialty numbers featuring instru-
mental units of the band. The brass
sextette and the saxophone and trom-
bone qu_artets will present novelty
numbers, and even two representa-
tives of the “instrumental elephants,”
the tuba section, will attempt to lum-
ber over the so-called “Pomposa.”

, There are still tickets available for
the concert, according to band offi-
cials. They may be obtained in the
ofﬁce of the military department,
Room 1101, Cathedral, in return fo-r
the proper token in the student activ-
ities book, After this afternoon, tick-
ets will be on sale to the general pub-
lic at the Carnegie Hall box oﬂice.

At Last

HEN THE University Library opens its doors on
the fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth ﬂoors of the Cathedral, a
long-felt need for library facilities will be satisﬁed. The
old State Hall quarters were cramped and the facilities
are both obsolete and incomplete, The only study room

«in the whole set-up was the lending room with its hard

chairs and bad illumination.

Reference card drawers were in the hall amid usual
jostle of the campus crowd. The periodical room was
little more than a cubby-hole with a few chairs, two
tables, and a row of magazine shelves. The process of
getting books was laborious and often there was but one
copy of a popular volume, and that was usually out.

In the new quarters in the Cathedral most of the me-

_chanical diﬁiculties have been eliminated. The reference

room on the ﬁfth ﬂoor is the main study room but it is
spacious and well-lighted, with comfortable lounges, easy
chairs and reference tables. The delivery of books has
been speeded up considerably with a book elevator and

electric signal system. Intercommunicating telephones
have been installed. The periodical room is large and
comfortable with space for many publications.

The card drawers have been given a separate room,
away from the confusion. On the sixth ﬂoor, the Dar-
lington and Aldred Memorial Libraries have been given
individual rooms, when once they were crowded into a
tiny space. Special reading rooms for men and women
will provide needed study and browsing places. On the
fourth ﬂoor there are hundreds of feet of storage shelv-
ing for books.

Still, with all the emphasis on luxury and reﬁnement
in the new library, there has been little mention of the
number and kind of books that will be available. ‘Will
there still be the limited number of volumes and incom-
plete editions that have been characteristic of the State
Hall library for such a long time? There is plenty of
space provided in the new quarters for books of all
kinds and descriptions. Almost every room has a large
amount of shelving. Let's hope the shelves are ﬁlled.-

Are Students Becoming Liberal?

OLLEGE STUDENTS MUST be way ahead of their
elders in social and political thought if the model
political platform drawn up by the conference in Harris-

burg is any indication of contemporary student thinking.

The planks set forth i-nclude mandatory unemployment

insurance; opposition to compulsory ROTC in all educa-
tional institutions; socialized medicine; national prohi-
bition of child labor; government ownership of the rail-
roads and natural resources; and others—all of which
have for years been advocated by liberal and radical or-
ganizations.

But of course there are several qualiﬁcations before it
can be assumed that the voters-to-be are forward-looking
and progressive at last. The students who attended the
conclave were naturally the more interes-ted and, per-
haps, the more liberal elements of their respective uni-
versities. Then, too, the very word “model” indicates
that the platform was a. theoretical, entirely objective
piece of work and was not intended to fit into the hard-
headed politician’s requirements of compromise to sat-
isfy the various sections. And ﬁnally, there is always
the explanation that college students are too idealistic
anyhow and that they don’t know anything about the
outer world’s selﬁshness, etc.

But let us be optimistic and hope that this inter-
collegiate convention’s proceedings were a sign of the
times and that the students who participated will not
abandon their ideas after graduation, University gradu-
ates are notorious for their disillusionment and oppor-
tunism after receiving their diplomas.

And it is interesting to note that, according to obser-
vations of some of the members, the University delega-
tion was one of the most liberal groups at the confer-
ence.—R. S.

French Botanist
Continues Studies
In Research Here

 

All unheralded and unsung in news
columns, a distinguished French
botanist and author, Mrs. Gabrielle
Bonne Wakeman, wife of Dr, R. L.
Vvakeman, fellow of Mellon Institute,
has all this school -year been-doing re-
search work by special invitation in
the department of botany, it was dis-
covered Friday by a delinquent Pitt
News reporter. '

Mrs. Wakeman ﬁrst studied science

at the Sorbonne in Paris. At that in-
stitution, she received the French de-
gree equivalent to the American B.
A. She later received her M. A. and
Ph. D. degrees at the Sorbonne. The
book she published for her thesis was
awarded a prize by the Academie des
Sciences, and the title of Laureate
de L’Academie.

After receiving her Ph. D., she was
the curator of a botanical station in
the French Alps.

Went To Goettingen

Mrs. Vvakeman later carried on re-
search work in botany at the Uni-
versity of Goettingen in Germany, and
then at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
on a fellowship she received from the
Sorbonne.

.Mrs. Wakeman returned to France
to teach at the Sorbonne. Upon her
return, she met her future husband,
who held a travelling fellowship.
After their marriage, they lived for
a year in Switzerland, later visiting
other parts of Europe.

Following her arrival in the United
States last year, Mrs. VVakeman pass-
ed the summer at Cornell. In the
fall, she came to the University with
her husband, who is doing research
at Mellon Institute. She is interested
primarily in observing the work done
in American universities.

Mrs. Vi/akeman is the author of a
number of articles in French and Ger-
man, and.for a few years. was on the
staff of the Museum of Natural His-
tory in Paris.

History 1Hter Hobby

Her hobby is the history of art, an
interest stimulated by her extended
visits to the museums of Italy a11d
Belgium.

Mrs. Vvakeman is a member of Sig-
ma Xi and member elect of Phi Sigma.
Besides belonging to various French
societies, she is a member of the
Botanical Society of Western Penn-

By William Stark
The Intercollegiate Conference on
Government adjourns for another year
and surveys with a satisﬁed air its

greatest accomplishment of the Con-
ference to date.

Miss Genevieve Blatt, graduate as-
sistant in political science, and execu-
tive director of the Conference, was
unanimously elected chairman of the
convention for the second successive
year. Frank Reich, C36. served as
temporary chairman during the re-
ports of the permanent committees at
the opening session. William Stark,
C38, chairman of the University dele-
gation, served as publicity director

it as stated in the Frazier-Lemke
Farm Relief Bill; and an extension of

tion.

Next year, according to Miss Blatt,
who will again serve as executive di-
rector, the Conference will take the
form of a. model legislature for the

German Inﬂuence
Shown In Films

Gaynor, 0’Brien Are Co-Stars
In Fine Arts Movie Program

By Sidney Shore

Equalling in sheer drama any of
the recent better movies, “Sunrise,”
three-reel feature of Monday's pro-
gram in the series of Fine Arts mov-
ies at the Falk Elementary School, was
an impressive representative of the
German influence in American ﬁlm.
The whole series is entitled “A Short.
Survey of the Film in America.”

Although the plot was elemental, the
story shows a cosmopolitanism and
an added depth of psychology, lacking
in earlier cinema products. Starring
George O'Brien, hero of “horse oper-
as.” and Janet Gaynor as the farmer
and wife, the cast also included Mar-
garet Livingston, the present Mrs.
Paul Whiteman, as the woman from
the city.

Using modern sweeping panoramic
views, the ﬁlm contains excellent pho-
tography and lighting. The tempo of
zthe acting never lagged except for the
inebriated pig and shoulder strap
These. although they provide
comic relief, are out of key with the
rest of the story.

The two emotional climaxes, the at-
tempted murder and the storm on the

show apt use of incidental music. The
emotional tensity of the latter high-
spot almost had the audience in tears.

The co—feature, “Hands,” was an ex-
periment by an American woman. Mrs.
Stella"Simon, made in Berlin. In this,
hands were the only mode of expres-
sion, and the subtlety of rhythm and
emotion expressed by these was truly
wonderful.

With a startling musical accompani-
ment. the actors gave new beauty to
the eternal triangle plot.

Spring Festival Track, Field
Carnival Offered Tomorrow

Fraternity, Independent Contestants To Vie For Honors
In Stadium Meet; Nine Events On Program

By Leonard Levison
A sure proof that spring is here and a surer proof that Spring
Festival ‘Week is running smoothly ‘can be had by vent.uring up

around the Stadium about 3:30 o’clock tomorrow afternoon.

By

that time a host of ambitious athletes will be stepping around the
Stadium track dressed in the ultra-ultra in spring sports wear, vari-

colored trunks and jerseys.

It will be just about that time when:

Carl Olson pulls the trigger to start
the 100-yard dashmen off and also the
annual Spring Festival Track and
Field Meet.

Open to everyone, according to the
collaborators, Martin J. Feely, direc-
tor of Intramural athletes, and Milton
Margolis, chairman, the meet will have
Greekmen and unattached entries run-
ning side by side. The gold medals,
only award of merit to be given, will
.go to the first place winners, regard-
less of their affiliations.

Team Trophies Offered

Added incentives, besides the gold
medals, will spur the fraternity en-
tries. High scoring chapters will re-
ceive emblematical trophies. Points
for the winners will be distributed in
the 5-3-1 manner.

Fraternities will be gunning for the
Kappa sigma outﬁt, winners last year,
and already having taken in enough
cups this year to keep the shelves
full for a long while to come. Includ-
ed among them were the Interfrater-
nity touch football and basketball
awards. .

High individual man last year was
an unattached entry, Johnny Wood.
“Snake” is11’t entered in this year’s
meet, so the entries, in the 100-yard
dash, the baseball throw, and the
220 run can take heart. If one man’s
going to steal the show, he hasn't been
uncovered yet.

The Kappa Sigs still have a power-
ful team featured by Marty Groat and
are hereby installed as fraternity fav-
orites. As far as individual prizes go,
it's any man’s ball game.

Gonglofi‘ to Perform

N. Robert Seidle will be sitting in
the Stadium tomorrow in the official
capacity of clerk of the Spring Fes-
tival Track and Field Meet. This
makes him headman tomorrow, inso-
far as officials are concerned. Carl
Olson will be starter, and such track
headlights as Penn Relay champ Good
will serve in minor official capacities.

As chief exhibit for the track hun-
gry, spectators, Pitt’s javelin experts
will perform. Intercollegiate cham-
pion Charley Gongloff will have to put
plenty behind that heave to beat Gene
Taano, fresh from his Penn Relay con-
quest.

Entry deadline is tomorrow at 12
o’clock. They will be accepted in Mr.
Seidle’s office or in the Trees Gymna-
sium office of Martin Feely.

Golfers To Meet
Conference Foes

Encounter Princeton, Georgetown,
Penn At Washington, D. C.

Having disposed of their ﬁrst two
opponents in ﬁrst-class, whitewash
fashion, Pitt’s crack golf team de-
parts for Washington, D. 0, tomorrow
for a trio of Eastern Conference en-
counters.

Coach Snyder’s linksmen open
league competition Friday afternoon
when they trade par-blows with a sex-
tet of outstanding golfers from the
University of "Pennsylvania. Early
Saturday morning Princeton will form
the opposition, and the local repre-
sentatives will conclude the hectic
weekend with a crack at Georgetown’s
outﬁt in the afternoon.

A sweep of these three matches
will give the Panthers a ﬂying start
in the newly-formed golf league and
send them into the conference lead.
The association composed of two divi-
sions, the .western and eastern, calls
for the two top teams in each section
to engage in a playoff tilt at Green-
wich, Connecticut, in May.

Meet State, Cornell

Penn State and Cornell are the
other two teams in the western sec-
tion in addition to the four groups
which tangle this weekend. The Pan-
thers meet these two teams the fol-
lowing week at Ithaca, New York.

Fifty—four holes of golf in a com-
petitive manner in two days is a tough
assignment for any group of collegiate
linksmen, or even professionals, and
Coach Art Snyder isn’t being too op-
timistic about the coming test.

In all probabilties he will use the
same six players who came ‘through
nobly in the ﬁrst two tests against
Tech and Grove City. The fact that
every varsity member holds the same
standing, each having two victories
in two starts, indicates that there will
be a few blemishes put on the unde-
feated slates.

Pat Symonds, Oakmont star, will
tee off at the No. 1 post, with Frank
Souchak. Jack Vvasco, Bob Mease, Bob
Baughman, and Sam Musico handling
the remaining assignments.

It-will mark the ﬁrst time that Pitt
has -ever stacked up against any of
the three teams, so not very much is
known about the merits of any of the
outﬁts.

Officers Elected

Lawrence H. Malenfant has been
elected president of the School of
Business Administration alumni as-
sociation for the coming year. Other
officers elected were: Carl J. Mulert,
ﬁrst vice president; Wayland S.
Bowser, second vice president; Endi-
cott A. Batchelder, secretary-treasun
er; and William C. Arther, representa-
tive to the alumni council.

Cleon Linderman
To Lead Boxers

Frosh Mittmen Honor Lupinacci;
Tentative Schedule Released

Cleon Linderman, letterman in box-
ing for the last two seasons, was elect-
ed captain of next year’s varsity mitt
team at a meeting held last Friday aft-
ernoon. Bob Culbertson was chosen
manager.

Freshman swingers elected George
Lupinacci as honorary captain of the
1936 yearling team. Lupinacci fought
in the 175-pound class and is regarded
as one of the most promising ﬁghters
to come along in recent years.

Linderman, who is also a member
of the football squad, had a fairly suc-
cessful season, ﬁghting in the 175-
pound class. He was used in the heavy-
weight division his ﬁrst year on the
team. '

Coach Schricker disclosed plans for
housing the mitt teams in the rooms
now occupied by the Stadium oﬁice
force next year.

A tentative schedule for next season
was also released. The schedule:

February 6—Pitt at Catholic Uni-
versity. '

February 13—Pitt at W&J.

February 20—Pitt at Tech.

February 27—Pitt at Temple.

March 2—Bucknell at Pitt.

March 13-Pitt at West Virginia.

Negotiations are under way to
schedule Western Reserve and either
Cornell or Ohio State.

Spring Practice
Bug Hits Cagers;
To Start Monday

That thar’ spring practice bug is
at it again! First, it ups and clips
Sutherland’s scrimmagers, and
they’ve been at it for weeks. Now, the
latest report shows that Carlson cage
cuties have been the objects of the
bug’s bite.

Dr, Carlson, in charge of the cager
case, sees the only remedy in the
prescription of basketball practice
right away. So next Monday, the
Stadium will ﬁnd Carlson’s patients
beginning their ﬁrst day of the sched-
uled two-week spring drills.

An annual procedure, Dr. Carlson,
has put off his spring sessions until
now, in order to wait for some good
weather. If the weather is good, the
boys will do their antics out on the
Stadium grass; if the weather is bad,
the Stadium basketball pavilion will
serve the purpose.

Only two of last season’s Panther
varsity will be missing when practices
start. Ted Roderick, captain of the
1935-36 squad, and Pete Noon, the
Panther cathedral, are the two not re-
turning.

Accordingly, prospects look about
as good as Mae West would if lined
up along one of our Cap and Gown
cuties. Returning are Billy Jesko,
the 1936-37 captain-elect, Bob John-
son, Rags Radvansky, Myles Zelez-
nick, Ed Spotovich, Frank Loucks,
Luke Rowe, and Joe Garcia of the
letter-earning group,

New varsity material will also be
coming up from the crack Panther
freshman team that clicked off 14 vic-
tories in a 15-game schedule last sea-
son.

Resume‘ Of Boxers, Riﬂers

ROTC, Varsity Marksmen
Compile Good Records;
16 Get Awards

By Al

Firing a total of 28 Collegiate
matches this year via the postal
route, the ROTC riﬂe team garnered
22 victories and six reversals to com-
pile one of the ﬁnest records ever
amassed by an ROTC outﬁt.

The highest scores of ten of the
15 men comprising the team, shooting
at a distance of 50 feet from the reg-
ulation NRA targets in the prone, sit-
ting, kneeling, and standing positions
are mailed to the competing schools.
Winners are determined on a com-
parative score basis,

Victories were scored over Idaho,
Cornell, University of California at
Los Angeles, Illinois, Ohio State, Ten-
nessee, Oklahoma A & M, Michigan,
and Washington State.

Three teams of ﬁve men each en-
tered the National Hearst Trophy
match, placing, ﬁfth, sixth, and twen-
ty-third in this corps area. The sharp-
shooting Panthers placed third in the
ROTC Third Corps area.

I. C. Duff led the marksmen with
a season’s average of 376.16. Riﬁemen
who earned the ROTC shield for their
performance this season were: J. C.
Duff, J. L. Poellot, C. B. Hoffman, A.
T. Duff, W. S. Greer, T. O. Eichler, E.
B. Haman, J. E. Currie, and manager

as well as the ROTC marksmen, but
ended the season on the, right side of

the scorebook with 33 triumphs against’

20 setbacks.

In the National Match ﬁred on the
Naval Academy range at Annapolis,
the varsity sharpshooters placed tenth,

_“In my high school and college coaching experiences my greatest satis-

With these words, Coach Potts, assistant track and cross-country

He continues to say that “it is not only the day-by-day advancement
of the'boy who actually atempts to progress in athletics, but also the
joy of accomplishment and the satisfaction derived from being able to
perfect an execution that has great value for the boy.”

Schmidt was successful on four bouts
out of six starts.

The freshman boxers ﬁnished the
season undefeated in competition,
trouncing the Allegheny YMCA, 7-1,
and drubbing the Culver Military
Academy team by the same margin.

Opening against Syracuse, the Pitt
boys lost a tough match by a 6-2
score, but made up for lost prestige
by deadlocking their fray with the
Eastern Conference champions, West
Virginia, 4-4. W & J's swingers took
a 5-3 count against them, but Cath-
olic University and Wisconsin proved
too strong, each taking a 7-1 decision.

The Panthers overwhelmed Tem-
ple, 6%-11/2 to account for their sec-
ond victory. Travelling to Lewis-
town, a tartar was encountered in
Bucknell’s Bisons who sprang a sur-'
prise by winning a close match, 41/2-
315. Some of the athletic honors lost
this past year to Carnegie Tech were
regained in the last duel meet of
the season, when Schricker’s ringmen
swamped the Kilties by a 6-2 victory.

In the Eastern Intercollegiate

championships at the PAA,“ Captain"

Paslowski, Abe Konick, and George
Dines reached the ﬁnal round in
their respective classes, but the deci-
sions went against them. .

Konick, 135-pound star, is the only
regular who will be lost through grad-
uation, but the ﬁne material expected
from the freshman team is expected
to give Pitt its ﬁnest boxing team in
history next year.

Irish Track Team
Favored Over Pitt

Taano, Good Score First Panther
“Double’ Win At Penn Relays

 

“It’s been so long,” now, and the
prospects are that it will be a whole
lot longer before a Pitt team scores
a victory over a Notre Dame team,
for Saturday, the Irish crusaders in-
vade the Pitt Stadium for a dual meet
with Coach Olson’s chargers, reput-
edly possessing its ﬁnest collection of

aces in track history at the South
Bend institution.

The last Panther triumph over a No-
tre Dame team was more than one

—YeaI‘ ago in the CIC championships,

at which time Pitt scored a distinct
upset victory in copping the team ti-
tle. Since then, the golfers, tennis
team, trackmen, cross country run-
ners, gridders, and even the cagers
have unsuccessfully attempted to
turn the trick. ,
Coach Nicholson’s squad copped the
CIC championship by a wide margin
during the past indoor season. In
this meet, the Pitt team could no bet-
ter than third place, far behind the

pace-setting Irish.

Although Olson’s squad successfully
passed the ﬁrst test of the season
against the Temple Owls at Philadel-
phia, the noticable weakness in the
weight department did not‘ show up
due primarily to the weakness of Tem-
ple weightmen. However, against No‘-
tre Dame, a team that has plenty of
power in the weights, the Pitt boys
will have to score heavily in several
ﬁeld events to offset that weakness,

Win At Penn Relays

While the relay teams bogged down
in the 42nd annual Penn Relays Sat-
urday, two Pitt boys, Walter Good and
Eugene Taano came through in grand
style to give Pitt its ﬁrst pair of Re-
lay champs in history.

Taano, a junior, was the favorite to
win the javelin, and was never serious-
ly pressed as he led all the Walk After
tossing the best qualifying heave, 193
feet, Taano, reached the 198 foot mark
on his sixth and ﬁnal attempt, winning
easily.

Good’s victory in the hop, step and
jump came as a distinct surprise. The
be-spectacled Pitt star did not win
the event until his sixth and ﬁnal
jump, leaping 44 feet, 9 and one-
quarter inches for the title.

Fassinger took a ﬁfth in the dis-
cus. The sprint-medley relay quartet
took fourth after leading until the
ﬁnal baton pass. The two-mile team
was far back in tenth position.

‘Varsity’ Gridders Register
Victory Over Reserves, 8-0

 

Both Teams Lack Offensive Power In Fourth Drill Game; '

Goldberg Continues To Show Ball-Toting Ability

 

By Edwin H. Beachler

VVith fair skies and a dry ﬁeld to make weather conditions ex-
cellent forwt-he fourth Saturday spring training game, the “Blues”
and “Yellows” found more interest in the gunmetal water buckets
and the soft probing ﬁngers of Drs. Moore and Shanor during the
frequent time-out periods than in solving the problem of just why
the backs could rarely escape the open arms of the defensive

tacklers.

The “Blues" scored their third vic-
tory of the four-game series, having
battled to a scoreless deadlock in the
other. But the 8-0 margin, “rolled-
up” when Frank Souchak blocked
Chickerneo's behind-the-goal punt late
in the ﬁnal quarter and when Gold-
berg topped this with a short line
plunge for the only touchdown, looked
more like Schoolboy Rowe's shut-out
victory over the combined powers in
the Three-Eye league than a Pitt foot-
ball victory.

Perhaps the “Blues,” reported to be
the varsity, could blame the “educat-
ed toe” of one Johnny “Snake” Wood
for the scoreless ﬁrst half. But when
“Snake” left the game during the half-
time rest period, 10 and behold what
did the boys do but chase ﬂys (they’re
around now) instead of running inter-
ference, and treat the nice “yellow”
jersies with much courtesy, except
twice when Umpire Baker caught two
blushing offenders and paced off 15
yards each trip for punishment.

No Offensive Punch

The “Blues” did make several, even
many ﬁrst downs during the ﬁrst half,
but mainly through the efforts of
some dandy ball-totin’ by a sophomore
prospect, Marshall Goldberg, who was
the hardest-running back on the ﬁeld.

However, each ‘time when the
scoutin’ grads and handful of “back-
ers” on the sidelines sensed a score,
something would go wrong to jam up
the works, and Johnny Wood would
calmly step back to ﬂy his kite, the
kite being the brown leather oval.
But the “Blues” knew there was a
string attached to it for after its 60
or 80-yard jaunts they couldn't bring
it back right away. Once, midway in
the second quarter, the “Blues” show-
ed a reversal of form. But this, too,
ended short of a score when a fum-
ble by LaRue turned the ball over
to the “Snake” and his gang.

Then even the unexpected happen-
ed when the “Ye1lows” safety man,
Johnny Urban, converted on Bill
Stapulis’ short kick from the goal line
by dashing back to the ten-yard line.
However, they soon accommodated by
returning the favor on a fumble after
an unsuccessful forward pass.

Defensively. members of both
elevens showed up well at times.
Frank Souchak blocked one punt in
the second half to account for two
points, and narrowly missed in halt-
ing the ﬂight of two others. “Bomb-
er” Shaw, at the other end, also gave
a good account of himself on several
occasions when he brushed aside the
interference to nail the ball carrier
for substantial losses.

One member of the “Blues,” Biff
Glassford, at guard, pulled out of the
line to dispose of the end and clear
the way for Goldberg several times.
When this happened, the ball carrier
usually made ﬁve or ten yards before

a host of “Yellow‘-Liackrets-” ganged
up on him.
The practice game next Saturday

will probably be the ﬁnal one of the
spring training session. On the fol-
lowing Saturday, the All-Star Alumni-
Varsity game will see the return of
many former Pitt stars and the ﬁrst
public showing of a Panther grid
team during a spring practice period.

This game, for the ﬁrst time, will
be held in the Stadium in conjunc-
tion with the Pitt-Penn State dual
track meet on that afternoon.

Senior women selected the two
dresses from which they will choose
their academic dress for this year at
a style show held Monday at Heinz

Either one of these two types of
dresses will be worn by senior wo-
