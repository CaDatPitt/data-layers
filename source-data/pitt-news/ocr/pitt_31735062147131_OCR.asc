last year’s Men’s Glee
Club men to the showers.

Banner Year Ahead

The Men’s Glee Club began its 46th
season last Monday with a general

 

meeting and tryouts attended by a

hundred University men. Dr. W. H.

VVright, associate professor of the
School of Dentistry, director of the
club since 1927, and Robert A. Euwer.
C36, business manager of the club,
expressed themselves as very well
pleased with the enthusiasm shown by
the new members.

“Judging by the excellence of the
voices I’ve heard in the ﬁrst group
of tests,” Dr. Wright said, “all indica-
tions point toward a banner year for
the club. For the first time in many
years the quality and number of new
voices surpass those lost by gradua-
tion of active members.”

Tentative plans for the year include
use of an upper Cathedral ﬂoor for re-
hearsal, production of an operetta in
conjunction with the W'omen’s Choral,
and the yearly concert tour and radio
appearances.

To aid him in his duties, Euwer has
selected Eugene Burkhart, C36, and
VVilliam Bolitho, C37, as assistant
managers, and ll-Ienry Cibula, C38, and
J. Ross Garman, C38, as apprentice
managers. Officers of the club are
Harry E. Robinson, Jr., C36, president;
Forrest H. Alter, Jr., C36, vice presi-
dent; and Paul Wolfe, Ed36, secre-
tary.

Originated 45 years ago by John
L. High ’91, the Men’s Glee Club
from a beginning of 12, has graduated
827 members, whose names were
gathered from various sources this
summer by Robert K. McConnell, Jr.,
EE35. The collection of this list of
names has led to the organization of
an alumni organization, with 420 mem-
bers already contacted.

At the initial meeting Adolph G.
Anderson, C34, now a graduate as-
sistant in the University department
of chemistry, was named ‘president;
Harry D. Abele, Jr., Ed35, president of
the 1934-35 club, was named vice pres-
ident, and McConnell was named sec-

. retary-treasurer. '

‘Actively sponsored by Dr. Wright,
the alumni organization was formed
to aid the undergraduate club in ob-
taining concerts, an-d to further alum-
ni participation in the club’s annual
home concert.

At the last home concert, held in
-Carnegie Hall, 60 alumni were on the
stage, participating in the program.
This year the newly organized group
hopes to raise that number to 200.

Of the 229 former members now liv-
ing in Pittsburgh and its environs,
perhaps the most famous is Harvey
Gaul, who received the degree of doc-
tor of music in 1933. For several
years Gaul was director of the club
and now has promised the alumni of-

ﬁcials his support in subsequent
plans. . _
Tryouts for general membership

will be continued this evening at 7
o'clock in Room 1001, Cathedral. At
that time applications also will be
received for quartet tryouts, Dr.
Wright announced.

 

New Government
Courses Draw 69

Registration Figures Announced
Yesterday By Charlesworth

Dr. James C. Charlesworth, assist-
ant professor of political science and
head of the recently organized Gov-
ernment Service courses of the de-
partment of political science, yester-
day announced complete registration
ﬁgures in the new courses.

There are 69 persons registered:
14 freshmen and advanced freshmen;
37 sophomores and advanced sopho-
mores; 16 juniors; and two special
students. Seniors are not included
this year, because zney had com-
pleted three-fourths of their college
careers when the course was insti-
tuted.

In addition to a division according
to classes, Dr. Charlesworth has pro-
vided the further division into ﬁelds
of activity. There are 32 students
registered in the public administra-
tion group, 26 registered in the for-
eign service division, four registered
in the international trade division,
two registered in the taxation and
ﬁnance division, and ﬁve registered
in the labor relations division.

In a recent interview, Dr. Charles-
worth stated, “The number of stu-
dents is sufficient as to quantity, but
I expect to improve the quality. I
expect that by the end of this semes-
ter, there will be one-third to one-
half as many students in the Govern-
ment Service course, as all students
will be adequately warned of their
deﬁciencies before they attempt to
take ;he Civil Service competitive
examination.”

Thursday Club Meets

The ﬁrst meeting of the Thursday
Freshman Club will be held at 12:30
("clock tomorrow in ihe Y Hut. An
organization and business session will
follow the luncheon.

Keiser Selects
A Dance Queen

Beverly Brown, Who Doubles As
CA Cabinet Aide Gets Bid

By Special Correspondent

Friday’s issue of The Pitt News
will ‘run pictures of Paul Keiser, ’36,
and Beverly Brown, ’37, and the cap-
tions and cut lines will say something
about “Leading Tonight's College As-
sociation Kickoff Informal at the
Grotto Ballroom.”

Just how they'll lead the dance, no
one, in years of research, seems to
have discovered. Certainly they
won’t get there early—because dance
chairmen and College Association
presidents never quite go in for that
sort of thing. And there’s no grand
march planned, cutting off an avenue
of escape offered heads of formal af-
fairs around here sometimes.

But he’s the president, and Miss
Brown is the young lady he’s escort-
ing, aiid, well they get their pictures
in the paper anyway, and we’ve just
got to have something to put in under
those cuts. one can’t stick a picture
on the page and let it go at that——it
isn’t considered good journalism.

Miss Brown, incidentally, is also a
member of the CA cabinet. However
Keiser, in answer to a particularly
tactless, urazen, uncalled for inquiry
from a News hanger-on, ﬂatly denied
that he is taking Miss Brown Friday
night merely to save the Association
from handing out an additional
“comp.” (In a recent sermon, we dis-
cussed “comps.” They're still the
nicest things about College.)

VVilliam Hughes, 36, social chair-
man of the Association, after making
all the arrangements for the Kickoff
Informal (for which Keiser will get
an the credit), announces, in a stage
whisper, that tickets are still on sale
a.t $1 per couple. The affair, as men-
tioned, takes place at the Northside
Grotto from 9 to 1 o'clock with Fran
Eichler’s crew on the band stand.»
About 400 couples are expected, he
says, many of which will be freshmen,
he hopes.

Book Exchange To Close;
Last Chance To Buy, Sell

The SFA book exchange, which
opened in the furnace room of Alumni
Hall last Tuesday, will be closed at
1:30 o'clock today. All students who

 

wish to buy or sell books should go

to the furnace room, where they will
be given immediate attention.

Verna Douglass, C38, Gail Brigham,
C38, Lucy Conn, C38, and Margaret
Robinson, 038, are new appointees to
the SFA book exchange committee.

Those Pins Help

Lots, You Know

Perhaps there’s no connection
between the official beginning of
men’s fraternity rushing tomor-
row morning and a steady stream
of requests at the Lost and Found
Bureau headquarters for Druid
pins.

How so many Druid pins hap-
pen to get lost is puzzling. the
aureau attendants terrmcally.
As yet no concerted campaign has
been begun to spot coeds display-
ing said badges.

Dr. John M. Ferguson, who ob-
tained a good deal of publicity
last year through adoption of
“lsm,” a feline of indeterminate
-‘ancestry, has asked the Bureau
to aid in the search for his pet-
missing ever since its precocious-
ness was advertised in a Pitt
News article last year.

16 Groups To Extend
Invitations To 600
F rosh, Others

By The Perennial Rushee

“So, freshman, you’re disappointed
in this week at Pitt, huh? No free
banquets, no Druid smokers, no Col-
lege Associa.ion Howdy Hops, nothing
to do but go to class and ogle the
babes, huh? Well, brighten up, fel-
low, a new day’s dawning—dawning
with a brilliance and a power and a
glory that shames Cape Horn on a
clear day. .

“I can remember like it was just
yesterday. I felt like you do today.
Somewhat lonely on campus, perhaps
a. bit homesick, undoubtedly beginning

l'l'lal'll_Y a place to study and learn and
not a gloriﬁed country club where
everything is free and the smokes are
plenty.

“Yep, it was about the second or
third week after classes had begun.
Freshman week had ﬂown away too
quickly, and the Druid smoker was
just a pleasant memory. The zoo
prof was beginning to bear down, and
the swimming in this weather each
week up at Trees Gymnasium was no
hot stuﬁ‘. Okay for Polar club-
tlfose dopes who get newsreeled each
New Year’s morning cutting a hole
and plunging into an ice dam and
pretending it’s fun. As for me, I’vc
always preferred an occasional sponge
bath with hot water in a ste-am~heated
apartment.

“That was how I felt a few years
ago today. You feel that way too, ya
scamps, deep down where it counts.

“Ah, but tomorrow. Ah . .

“Listen, before I go further, allow
me to advise. ‘You uave those little
green buttons, no? Wear them to-
morrow. Forget your necktie and
underwear, if you have to dress in a
hurry to get to College Or. on time,
but DON’T forget that pin. Tin Pan
Alley’s just produced something
about Aladdin's lamp, and that's what
that pin will be for you.

Life Recommences

“Have upperclassmen been ignoring

you on campus, despite the plea of

The News to “Greet the Green?”
'lhat’s done with. Tomorrow they
get a change of heart. And you g:t

some good lunches. And dinners.
And dates. And cigars (for you, or
Pop, or Brother Joe or anybody). And
some upstairs pep talks from pro-
fessional browbeaters, but, what's the
odds?

“Freshman, if you’ve neglected to
read your “Compass” this week, let
it be known that tomorrow at the
bark of 8 o’clock, millions of frater-
nity men get in the mood for love,
and there’s nothing you can do about
it but be nice and accept any and all
invitations. And soon you can show
your gratitude for it all. But that
comes later.

"Tomorrow, the cares of the world
take a decided setback in campus at-

blithely; greetings “rattle on the
mountains, recoil in the dell”; your
right hand takes a beating; and you’ll

Greeks To Rise Early,
Awaiting  0’Clock
‘ Starting Signal

By Reuben Slesinger

“The activity in the dean of men’s
oﬂice the past week indicates that the
prospects for an intensive and suc-
cessful rushing season are very good,"
said N. Robert Seidle, assistant to
the dean of men, in commenting upon
the fraternity rushing season, to start
tomorrow.

“I believe that every fraternity man -

will observe the rushing rules in
spirit, as well as in letter. The fresli-
men have been fully informed in the
ethics of fraternity rushing, and cer-
tainly should cooperate fully with In-
terfraternity Council in making this
rushing season more successful than
ever before,” Seidle concluded.

Tomorrow morning, at 8 o’clock, 16
fraternities, 13 members of the Inter-
fraternity Council, two non-members,
and one professional, will enter upon
an intensive and detailed program of
rushing, centered around 600 fresh-
men. ‘ .

After two weeks of activity in pre-
paring the houses, searching census
records, and in other methods “getting
a line” on the new men, fraternity
men W.-- approach new and old stu-
dents tomorrow, and for the next ten
days, with invitations to lunches, din-
ners, smokers, movies, dances, ath-
letic events, and other forms of en-
tertainment.

As explained in the Fraternity
Handbook, annual publication of Inter-
fraternity Council, which has been
distributed to each freshman, the
prospective rushees are virtually as
responsible as the fraternities them-
selves in conducting a pleasant and
enjoyable rushing season. No fresh-
man should accept fraternity invita-
tions before he has carefully and
thoroughly read the rushing rules.
Any points of doubt should be cleared
up immediately at the office of Mr.
Seidle, Room 801, Cathedral.

Must Remember Rules

Particularlyi-I'ifh‘p6'rtant are those
rules concerning the duration of rush-
ing, the silence period, and the extent
to which entertainment may be car-
ried. Rushing will begin tomorrow
morning at 8 o'clock and continue un-
Lu 2 o’clock, Sunday morning, Octo-
ber 13.

Rushees‘ should rememuer that at
no time during the rushing period
may they remain in a fraternity house
cver night, nor be the guest of a. fra-
ternity member or pledge over night.
At the close of the rushing period,
the “silence period” will begin. This
period Wlll continue unti. 5 o’clock,
Monday, October 21. During the si-
lence period no members or pledges
of a fraternity shall approach, talk
to, or communicate by direct or iii-
direct means with any newly-regis-
tered student.

Invitations to bid will be issued by
the preferential system through the
office of the dean of men. During the
silence period, rushees may make
I nown to the dean of men their choice
of a fraternity. However, coincident
with the close of the silence or bic-
uing period, the fraternities may not
pledge nor issue invitations to pledge-
ship to any newly-registered student
for a period of one month. Students
coming to the campus from Junior
Colleges, Downtown Division, and stu-
dents returning after a semester or
more of absence are considered as
new students and the rushing rules

Homer M. Rutherford, instructor in
seismology at the University, has re-
cently been granted leave of absence
for several weeks in order to com-
plete research in the charting of the
bedrock of the age-old Appalachias,
and the submerged continent which
once overlapped the present eastern
coastline of the United States and ex-
tended far into the Atlantic Ocean.

Mr. Rutherford came to the Univer-
sity in 1932 to assume the position of
supervisor of the seismograph sta-
tion, upon the death of Dr. J. Ham-
mond Smith, former head. In addi-
tion to supervising this station, Mr.
Rutherford is also instructor in seis-
mology, conducting courses in both
pure and applied seismology, covering
every possible aspect of the subject,
namely, the cultural, historical and
descriptive, and individual research.

In 1929, the University authorities,
in co-operation with the United States’
Coast and Geodetic Survey, decided
upon the establishment of a seismo-
graph station at the University of
Pittsburgh. Foremost in this move-
ment was Mr. George LI-Iubbard Clapp,
president of the Board of Trustees.
Since that time, the station has oper-
ated daily, recording vibrations of the
earth, and its periodical shifts.

Mr. Rutherford has been specializ-

Leave Of Absence Granted
To University Seismologist

Homer Rutherford To Spend Several Weeks In Research
On Charting Of Bedrock On Eastern Coastline

ing in this ﬁeld for the past ten years,
having been ﬁrst associated with the
Geo-Physical Research Corporation
at Houston, Texas, from 1925 to 1928.
In 1928 he became chief of the Geo-
Physical Exploration Company at Tul-
sa, Oklahoma, remaining in this ca-
pacity until he joined the University
staff in 1932.

In his present work, off the coast
of Norfolk, Virginia, Mr. Rutherford
is associated with Dr. Benjamin Leroy
Miller, Dr, Maurice Ewing, and Albert
P. Crary of Lehigh University.

The seismograph station at the Uni-
versity, is one of 38 tele-seismic sta-
tions in the United States. The Uni-
versity is the only educational insti-
tution in the State of Pennsylvania
offering seismography course. The
course was added when it was discov-
ered how important a knowledge of
this subject is to those engineers oc-
cupied in oil mining and other forms
of mining.

Mr. Rutherford’s leave of absence
commences in a few weeks and is to
run for several weeks thereafter.

In a recent interview, Mr. Ruther-
ford stated, “I think that seismology
is a fascinating subject. I believe
that the reason so few students take
the course is because they do not
realize its scope and content as a
practical aid to engineering and min-
ing of all forms.”

Outlines Plans

SSISTANT TO the dean of men

Four seminars of the School of En-
gineering elected officers and named
representatives to the Engineering As-
sociation at the ﬁrst of their regular
weekly meetings held last Thursday.

The Electrical Engineering Seminar,
sponsored by Howard E. Dyche, head
of the department of electrical engi-

neering, elected the following officers:

president, Oliver D. Montgomery,
EE36; vice president, Charles Grim-
shaw, EE36; and secretary, John F.
Carolus, EE36. Engineering Associa-

Harrison C. Bashioum, head of the de-
partment of chemical engineering,
are: president, Thomas A. Napier,
ChE36; vice president, Albert Tim-
mins, ChE37; and secretary-treasurer,
John W. MacDonald, ChE36. The rep-
resentatives to the Engineering Asso-
ciation are: John W. Britton, ChE36,
senior representative, and Florian
Majchrzak, ChE37, junior representa-
tive. ‘

H. H. Rothrock, head of the depart-
ment of industrial engineering and di-
rector of the Industrial Engineering
Seminar, has announced the election of
the following officers: president, John
R. Worth, IE36; vice president, Philip
Short, IE36; secretary, Francis Diven,
IE37; and treasurer, John Woolley,
IE37. Edward W. Shephard, IE36,
was named senior representative and
James W. Shields, IE37, junior repre-
sentative to the association.

The Civil Engineering Seminar,
headed by L. C. McCandliss, head of
the department of civil engineering,
elected W. G. Hall, CE36, senior rep-
resentative to the Engineering Asso-
ciation and William McQuade, CE37,
as the junior representative.

Robert R. Smith, AE36, will replace
Edward C. Teats, AE36,’ as the senior
representative of aeronautical depart-
ment due to the latter’s ineligibility.

Inquiry To Hold
Opening Forum

Dr. Giacomo Brunetti, head of the
Italian department of the Mellon Na-
tional Bank, will be the ﬁrst speaker
to face Inquiry Club this year.

“The Italian View of the Ethiopian
Crisis” is the subject of Dr. Brunetti’s
talk, which will be given today in
Room 107, Alumni Hall, at 12:30
o’clock.

Although Dr. Brunetti is known as
an authority on the Italian-Ethiopian
question, he has no formal connection
with the Fascist government at Rome.

Any student is free to attend the
session, and new students are par-
ticularly invited, according to Kath-
erine h’I_OllOl‘l, C36, and Edward Van
Kirk, C37, co-chairmen. There wi'l
be an open forum discussion after the
talk by Dr. Brunetti.

 

Swiss Scientific Groups
Elect Raschen Member

Dr. John F. Raschen, professor of
modern languages, has been elected
a member of the Franklin Society and
the Scientiﬁc Society of Zurich.
Switzerland. The appointments were
made this summer.

The purpose of these organizations,
according to Dr. Raschen, is for the

“dissemination of scientific knowl-
edge.” -
Dr. Raschen addressed the Kiwanis

Club at a meeting last Thursday. He
spoke on the subject, “The African
Manchu-tauo.”

Lanfear Outlines
Orientation Plan
For Coming Year

Course Seeks To Start Freshmen
On Right Direction By Contacts
With Faculty, Upperclassmen

SFA Counselors To Aid

Bringing the freshman and his
problems into intimate contact with
faculty men and experienced upper-'
classmen with the view toward start-
ing each new student in the right di-
rection, is the object of the new fresh-
man orieiitatioii program, according
t.o its director, Dr. Vincent "W. Lan-
fear, dean of men.

“Included in the course will be lec-
tures and discussions on University
history, methods of study, note-taking,
formation of correct habits, time
budgeting, particularly the building up
of personality,” Dr. Lanfear stated.

“We feel that by this system the
number of worthy freshmen who are
unsuccessful because they are poorly
adjusted to an entirely new type of
life can be considerably reduced.”

By reducing the size of classes from
800 to 25 or 30, and by having one
faculty man and at least two students
in charge of each group, it has become
possible to give some attention to the
study and adjustment questions of
each individual freshman.

Before each class the faculty and
upperclass advisers meet to determine
the course to be followed. In classes
such as study or vocational guidance,
the faculty man, who directs the
group, will usually volunteer informa-
tion. On such questions as activi-
ties, campus behavior, or internal col-
lege affairs, the upperclassmen, speak-
ing from recent experience, will prove
invaluable, according to Dr. Lanfear.

“This departure from men’s orienta-
tion programs of former years is more
than an experiment,” Dr. Lanfear stat-
ed. “It is only after years of experi-
mentation with various types of pro-
grams that we have evolved the sys-
tem which is now in effect.”

The second semester of college ori-
entation, last year a survey of courses
offered throughout the University, has
not been deﬁnitely decided upon for
the next semester. It is planned, ten-
tatively, to provide faculty speakers
from the various departments to ad-
dress the entire assembly of freshmen,
a procedure modeled after the plan
used last year.

The customs committeeiof the Stu-
dent Faculty Assembly, under the
chairmanship of Charles Herald, C36,
is assisting Dr. Lanfear in the cus-
toms and orientation program. Herald
has chosen three new members for
his committee, Charles B. Holstein,
C36, Robert Culbertson, C38, and John
Glasser, BA38. »

Players Tryouts
Take Elgge Today

Members To Compete For Parts
In Opening Play, “Show-Off”

 

Final tryouts for George Kelly's
play, “The Show-Oﬁ,” will be held
this afternoon in Room 315, Alumni
Hall, from 3 to_5 o’clock.

All old members of the Players,
and those new ones who successfully
passed the ﬁrst tryouts, are eligible
to compete for a part in the ﬁrst
production of the Players this season.
Mr. Carl Cass, director of the Play-
ers, urges all those old members, who
have not registered this year, to do
so at once. _

-Charles Foreman, recently appoint-
€.(1 technical director of the Players,
may direct an additional play the
Players hope to produce, in addition
to the three already scheduled, Cass
announced.

The “show-Off.” When zoublished.
was hailed as the best comedy ever
written. by an American playwright.
Mr. Kelly, brilliant native of Penn-
sylvania, began his career as a vaude-
iille actor, and later turned to writ
ing sketches and plays.

Wednesday, November 13, has
been tentatively set as the date for
the campus presentation of “The
Show-off.”

Instruiztors Appointed
In Engineering School

Three alumni of the School of En-
gineering- are back this year as in-
structors. Mr. Ivan Gradisar, AE3-4,
has returned as instructor in mechan-
ical enginering in the mechanic-il
laboratory. A new instructor in
chemical engineering is Edward R.
Mease, Ch. E34, and John M. Ojala,
CE34, is instructor in civil engineer-
ing in engineering drawing.

Mr. Leo Niihfei', CE35, resigned the
position he has held in oil and gas
engineering for the past two years
to accept the position as engineer
with a Pittsburgh gas company.

Dr. Titterer, instructor in metal-
lurgy, while on leave of absence has
been studying metallurgical develop-
inents in France and England. He
will resume classes at the University
about October 28. '

"1 EVEILLE BLOWS AT 8 o’clock tomorrow
R morning for 16 men ’s fraternities of the Uni-
versity. Taps will be sounded over the
weary heads of rushees and rushers alike at the
rather odd hour of 2 o’clock in the morning, a

week from the coming Sabbath.

Between this particular Reveille and this partic-
ular Taps there will be a very long and eventful
day. The continuous round of dinners, dances,
parties, smokers, and all other forms of amusement
which the Greek men spend their summers concoct-
ing, would sorely try the mind and body of anyone
other than an eager freshman.

Yet, it is altogether proper that this should be
so. The deferred rushing plan followed by campus
fraternities is a very wise one indeed. First-year
men are at least given a chance to get both feet
planted ﬁrmly on University ground and to attend
two or more classes before the rushing bug bites.

No advice we can offer would surpass that which
has been expounded to freshmen on every hand:
“Attend as many rushing events as you can pos-
sibly attend.” The fraternities want you to come,
it will do you good to go, and you are in no way
under any obligation by so doing.

You are cautioned to guard against the boys who
want to take you up alone to see the new dormi-
tory and who proceed to put on the pressure there.
You are advised to observe carefully not the se-
niors and juniors in the house, but the sophomores
there and those of your own class who may become

members. These are the ones with whom you will
have to live, for the upperclassmen will soon be
gone. It is suggested that you seek to discover
just how much of the fellowship and liveliness
which is part of the rushing program will fade
soon after.

But go right to it, freshmen. You have every-
thing to gain and nothing to lose. You’ll have a
ﬁne chance to get acquainted and decide whether
or not you want to be a fraternity man. Get that
little date book ﬁlled with dates for as many
houses as possible. Eat their food, dance on their
ﬂoors, go to their parties, and learn for yourself
their prestige and their character.

Have a good time, freshmen! But remember:
the faculty members are not being rushed. Recita-
tions and quizzes and lectures will go on the same
the next day whether or not you are prepared, and
without regard to your having had two or four
hours of sleep the night before.

 

John Weber, Business Manager

’ NCE UPON A TIME the Chancellor wanted a
0 job done and he wanted it done in quick or-

der. He wanted a chart that would show the
cubic contents of leading universities doing the
same work with the same number of students as
did the University of Pittsburgh. He didn’t want
to wait around for a semester.

He called in a young fellow in the School of En-
gineering. The young fellow’s name was John
Weber. The legend says that John Vlfeber pro-
duced the desired chart pronto, if not sooner.

Today John Weber holds the title of Business
Manager of the University. That title covers a
multitude of duties which would take Emma Wol-
fel, his secretary, many hours to set down on her
typewriter.

Many difficult student problems ﬁnd their way
to Mr; Weber ’s desk. In fact, when someone asked
Chancellor Bowman during the ﬁrst week of school
if registration headquarters had been moved up
from. the Cathedral to "State Hall, the Chancellor
smiled as he replied, “I thought the headquarters
had been in John Weber ’s ofﬁce all week.”

It must be rather trying at times to have a posi-
tion like Mr. Weber, for virtually every student he
meets has some problem that is of vital importance
to the student. His inﬁnite patience, his love for
students, and his whole-hearted appreciation of
their difﬁcnlties have carried him along in the con-
tinued successful discharge of his duties.

Students can trust John VVeber. They can have
conﬁdence in him. That the thirty-ﬁfth student to
see him in a day receives attention equally as cour-
teous and considerate as the ﬁrst, is a ﬁne tribute
to Mr. VVeber’s ability.

University Registrar John G. Quick has mailed
500 copies of Friday’s issue of The Pitt News to_
neighboring high schools. The story showing the
enrollment increase at the University should prove
to the high school students that their chances‘ of
getting to college are improving.

I Pitt Personals

Faculty athletic fans of the ﬁrst degree are Professors
Goldberger and Nietz, in the School of Education. From
his eighth ﬂoor window, Professor Nietz can reproduce a
Forbes Field ball game from a glimpse of home plate
and the outﬁeld.

Lieutenant-Colonel Shrader, Military Department, who
broke an arm at the camp at Fort Monroe last summer,
is now limping as a result of a painful accident to his
hip, also suffered in the line of duty.

Everett Pickering, C35, is lurking around the campus
with his deadly candid camera, ostensibly working on a
master’s. If you’re not good, Pick may get you.

Nominations for best smiles on the football squad:
Bobby McClure and Cleon'Linderman.

That new bandmaster’s uniform worn by Director
Lockhart was designed by Captains Tredennick and
Kleinman.

Mccready Huston, director of University publicity, has
discovered that there is no coveted 50-yard line in the
Stadium, that peerless vantage point being occupied by
an aisle.

Robert Bowdler, junior in the College last year and
erstwhile _Cap and Gowner, is now_ attending night
school. “Deke” is working for the city in the day time.
Robertiiliramei-, business manager of the Panther for
twoyears ending in 1934, now sells University publica-
tio_n_s-——a‘_nd any others he can ﬁnd—engraving for a down-
town ﬁrm.

Herbert Fine, School of Mines graduate of two years
ago, had The Pitt Newssent to him successively at Hali-
fax,-,Nova Scotia; Brooklyn, New York; and Portland,
Oregon,Vlast. year. Now Herbert is lost. At any rate, the
last issue of The News mailed to him was returned with
the caption “Moved——No Forwarding Address.”

John Glasser, BA38, did plenty of traveling this sum-
mer. Just after spring exams were over he left New
York on the S.S. Santa Elena, a Grace Line steamship,
which sailed to Havana, San Salvador, Costa Rica, Guat-
emala, Meixco, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

Walter Klein, student in the School of Medicine, broke
into the headlines this summer by applying artiﬁcial res-
piration to bring back to life a nine-year-old boy who
was thought drowned. A doctor at a Detroit hospital had
stated that the lad was apparently dead and only the
quick action of Klein saved the boy’s life.

 

Adolph Kalil has been appointed captain and manager
of the band. He will continue as drum major. William
Ja.rrat is now assisting in the job of drum majoring.
(You ought to see him twirl the baton.)

S. J. Tracy, instructor in the mechanical engineering
department, is taking care of the band’s drug division.
Unknown to most students, there has been a change of
the drums. They now have a GOLD shell and a BLUE
rim.

Intercollegiate

A Tip To Shavers

There is at least one professor at the University of
Washington faculty who teaches by example. Becoming
exasperated at the girls who powder their noses during
lectures, he conspired with a boy in one of his classes.
The next day the boy appeared with a razor and shaving
mug, and proceeded to shave himself.

Some Figures

In spare moments, a Cornell professor compiled the
following data on what college students do with their
time: _

1. Senior men spend 55 hours a week sleeping.

2. Women devote four more hours per week to per-
sonal appearance than do men.

3. Senior men are more studious and they spend nine
and one-half hours at the dining table per week. (Evi-
dently this does not include breakfasting and luncheon-
ing.)

4. Freshmen write home on the average of two and
one-half hours a week. Women consume nine hours and
30 minutes each week for entertainment. ,

At least the students’ spare time is more proﬁtably
spent than the professor's who ﬁgured out this informa-
tion.

Pass The Grapefruit

Since this is the beginning of another college year, we
might as well let you in on a cribbing secret gleaned
from the New York University paper. It seems that up
there they have found out that notes written on spec-
tacles in grapefruit juice become visible when the spec-
tacles are breathed upon.

A Good Idea

A student at Colorado University must attend Sunday
school for three years if he is caught drinking.

This Machine Age!
At Ohio State a machine which automatically grades
papers has been invented. Some professors probably
still use the old method of throwing them up the stairs.

Name Your Boy “Leavenworth” _
A most unique scholarship is offered by Hamilton Col-
lege. Worth $500, it is open to all men by the name of
Leavenworth.

“Stray Greeks”

A society known as ‘the “Stray Greeks” has been
started at Purdue Universityl It is composed of transfer
students who were members of Greek letter organiza-
tions not represented at Purdue.

Well?
Seen on bulletin board at Carnegie Tech:
“Cheerleader wanted; must be’ neat, honest, and in-
telligent.”
One week later: _
“Cheerleader wanted; no qualiﬁcations necessary.”

He’s No Angeli

According to President Angell of Yale, a historical
novel is like a bustle. It is a ﬁctitious tale based on a
stern reality.

Roderick Named
Panther Leader

Star Senior Forward To Captain
Cats In Coming Campaign

Ted Roderick, sharpshooting for-
ward, has been awarded the captain-
cy of the 1935 Pitt basketball team.
Three years ago we couldn’t make
the freshman starting line-up and
now he is perched on the top rung of
the Panther basketball ladder.

In addition to his basketball dex-
terity, Ted is a linguist of no mean
ability. Spanish by direct descent,
he rattles off his native tongue with
as much ease as he swishes the ball
through the basketball net. He
serves as a Spanish interpreter for
Allegheny County Courts and is a
Spanish major at the University.

Ted’s high school days were spent
at Scott High in North Braddock,
where Coach Johnny Reed didn’t have
room for him on the varsity ﬁve. En-
tering Pitt he still couldn’t make the
grade and his freshman year found
Roderick among the scrubs.

As a substitute 4-- ﬁnally broke
into action during his sophomore
year. He furnished the spark which
kept the Panther spirit burning in
the tag end of the ’33-34 season. His
sensational scoring during the ﬁnal
periods, when he was injected into
the lineup, was responsible for sev-
eral Pitt victories.

The highlight of his collegiate
career was reached last year in the
ﬁnal Duque.-:-ne game. Only seconds
lefore the ﬁnal whistle blew, Ted
dropped in the winning ﬁeld goal,
giving the Panthers a rather welcome
.'~'.5-34 victory.

Reiser Completes New
Philosophy Reference

In his new book, “Philosophy and
the Concepts of Modern Science,” Dr.
Oliver L. Reiser, associate professor
of philosophy, attempts to ﬁll the
pressing need for an adequate phil-
csophy of science.

The book, which represents ﬁve
years of intensive researclc by the
author, was completed last winter and
published recently by the Macmillan
Publishing company.

John Dewey, noted author and
logician, will review the book in the
October issue of “The New Human-
ist,” a journal of liberal religious and
social philosophy.

A combination offer of both the
book and the magazine, of which Dr.
Reiser is associate editor, will be an-
nounced in the same issue.

Puffer Replaces Mc Cabe

In Economics Department

 

.——_.—

Dr. George K. McCabe, former as-
sistant professor of economics here
who resigned to become associate
professor and acting head of the de-
partment at Catholic University,
Washington, D. C., has been replaced
on the University faculty by Claude
E. Puffer.

Mr. Puﬂer will teach classes in pub-
lic utilities, economics, and market-
mg.

A graduate of the University of
Washington in Seattle, Mr. Puffer has
done graduate work at Stanford Uni-
versity and has worked under the
Federal Powers Commission for three
years.

Graham Praises
Cultural Aspects
'- 1 . - 0 .
Of News Writing

Robert X. Graham, new instructor
in journalisrn at the University, has
spoken in favor of the recent combi-
nation of the department of journal-
ism with the _department of English,
effected this fall.

Mr. Graham believes that journal-
ism should be considered for its cul-
tural aspect aswell as for its voca-
tional value. As a form of applied
English, it is helpful to the student
not only in writing for newspapers,
but also in his daily contact with
newspapers as a reader.

There are, Mr. Graham said, three
ways of viewing journalism in educa-
tion. The ﬁrst is to consider it a
strictly Vocational subject. The sec-
end is to treat journalism as a grad-
uate study not to be taken in under-
graduate work.

This attitude has found favor in
several leading universities, including
Columbia University.

The third view 1S to include courses
in journalism in undergraduate work,
rxaking them available .o sophomores,
juniors, and seniors.

and pledging regulations apply to
them.

Each prospective rushee is urged
to read the advice of Dr. Vincent W.
Lanfear, dean of men, and Mr. Seidle,
as contained in the Fraternity Hand-
book. This impartial and practical
advice from two administration offi-
cials who are in daily contact with
fraternity men will be of invaluable
aiuto the man who is being rushed.
lvloreover, he should also read about
the other factors of the fraternity
question which is presented in the
same publication. The rushee who
accepts invitations and who is in-
formed as to the details of fraternity
iushing will undoubtedly have “a
much better time” during the whole
period, indicated Seidle.

Fraternity rushing rules ‘advise
that: The rushee should accept every
invitation which it is physically pos-
sible for him to accept; no obliga-
tion to a fraternity is entailed by ac-
cepting an invitation to a.ttend some
social affair; before accepting any
bid to pledge a fraternity, the rushee
should be deliberative and calm and
should seek the advice of University
officials, and should learn all the obli-
gations connected W..- membership;
he should guard against remarks
made by uninformed persons.

“By cooperation of both the rushees
and the fraternities,” according to
Edward Durkin, C36, president of In-
terfraternity Council, “rushing this
year will be not only a success, but
also a pleasant and happy experi-

Changes In Panther Lineup
Expected For W& J Contest

 

Pitt’s First Visit To Presidents’ Home To Open Season
For Little Washington Aggregation

Hard work and plenty of it is the prescribed diet for the Panther
football team this week in order to get in top shape for the next game
on the schedule, that with W&J at Washington, Pa., Saturday after-

110011.

Far from satisﬁed with his team’s showing against Waynesburg,
Coach “Jock” Sutherland is expected to make several changes in his
starting array before the Panthers take the ﬁeld against the

A
T

Presidents.

One change in the lineup will proba-
bly have Johnny Micheloson, sopho-
more quarterback, replacing big Arn-
old Greene at the signal-barking post.
Michelosen was at the helm when the
Panthers drove down the ﬁeld for
their ﬁrst touchdown against the
Wolfpack.

The Presidents, with their tricky of-
fense, cannot be taken too lightly.
With recollections of what took
place two years ago when a scrappy
W’. & J. outﬁt held the Panthers
scoreless for 56 minutes only to be
nosed out, 9-0, in the dying stages of
the ﬁnal quarter, the Pitt boys can ex-
pect almost anything this Saturday
in the nature of a surprise.

The Pitt game is considered the
“key” contest on the VV. & J. grid pro-
gram and a victory for the Washing-
ton County collegianswould virtually
assure a successful season for them.
Saturday’s game will be the thirty-
third meeting between the two
schools.

Day Starts Fourth Year ’

Coach «Hank Day, starting his fourth
season as head man, lost 14 lettermen
from last year’s aggregation, but
strangely enough a like number of in-
signia-wearers have returned this
year, giving him a. good starting point
from which to round out a team.

Vvhile no starting lineup has been
selected, two Washington, Pa., lads

seem to have the edge for the end
posts. These are Ed Hennen and Jap
Reed. Reserve material is available
in Robba and Tom Malcolm.

Tackles are scarce, but Coach Day
has moved Captain Tony Paulekas,

varsity center last year, over to one
ofthe tackle posts. Elmer Garvin, a
former Langley High school star, will
probably hold down the other tackle
job.

A couple of West Virginia youths,
Tony Slenski and Mike Skulos, have
been seeing plenty of action at the
guard positions. Other aspirants for
these posts are Don Mungello and
Martinchek.

Two sophomores will probably share
the center duties. Art Petrecca and
Joe Lichvar have shown up well in
practice and either one may ﬁll the
snapper-back opening against the
Panthers.

With plenty of backﬁeld material
returning for gridiron warfare, Coach
Day’s task for rounding out a starting
quartet is much simpler than his line
problem. Joe Hardy, veteran ﬁeld
general, and Hats Merritt, a promis-
ing sophomore, will take charge ‘of
the quarterback position.

Croft Scored Last Year

‘Dan Croft, the Sharon speedster
who scored. his team's lone six-pointer
against the Panthers last year, will
probably get the starting nod at left
halfback. His alternate will be Mike
Rosso, former Kiski ﬂash. At right
half two seniors are battling for the
starting assignment. Either Mike
Merlo or Bill Wilson, both of them
shifty runners, will be found at the
right halfback post.

John McBurney, veteran fullback,
will ﬁll the fourth spot in the back-
ﬁeld. He is being pressed by an up-
and-coming sophomore, Glenn Etzwel-
ler. who has distinguished himself in
the training drills.

The Presidents have been drilling
since Labor Day and the clash with
Pitt will open their pigskin season,
Saturday’s game will mark the ﬁrst
time that a Pitt football eleven has
ever invaded College Field in Wash-
ington_

Novice Runners, Jumpers,
Weight-Men To Get Chance

 

Fourth Annual Fall Track And Field Games Expected
To Draw Record Turn-Out October 16, 17

Novice runners, jumpers, and
weight men are hard at work on the
Stadium track in preparation for the
fourth annual University Track and
Field meet on October 16-17. With
just two weeks left before the open-
ing of the meet, 17 aspirants are al-
ready competing in daily practice ses-
sions and are gradually rounding into
shape for the All-University title
events.

Probably the heaviest entry list has
been made in the distance events.
Milers and half-milers who will take
their marks on Wednesday, October
16, include Edward Dines, Al Acken-
heil, Ken -Gust, Maurey Mayhouse,
Alvin Roth, James Filson, Johnny
Woodruﬁ, and Joseph Zambrosky.

Dines will also compete in the pole
vault and -Gust will likewise take
part in a third event, the two-mile
run_

Sprint men who have been partici-
pating in the daily workouts are Ed-
son Routch, Charles Poole, Julius
Rivilin, Glenn Cooper, and Ted Fall.
Routch and Rivilin also broad jump
and Cooper steps both the low and
high hurdles. Ken Ryden, Wissner,
and Ralph Parsons loom up as other
threats in the hurdle races.

In the weight events, Bob Harris
and Bill Klein are the only contest-
ants working out in the regular prac-
tice sessions at the present time.
Coach Olson, who is in charge of the
fall games, especially urges men to
sign up for competition in the weight
contests, pole va.ult,’and high jump.
“I can use plenty of men in these de-
partments,” he stated.

It was in the third annual Univer-
sity games ‘just a year ago that many
present varsity track men ran their
ﬁrst race on the Stadium track.
Some of these boys had little or no
previous experience. Perhaps the out-

standing example of this was George

Clifton’s rapid progress in the pole
vault. In last year’s meet, George
placed second with a leap of 8 feet 6
inches.

In six months of practice under
Coach Olson, Clinton became a 12-
foot jumper, climaxing his rise with
a ﬁrst in the Penn State-Pitt yearling
meet. Three years ago, George Cook
showed promise in the distance runs

Transfer Busts Buttons,
Record By Expanding
Chest Six Inches

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, head of the
Student Health Service, for the ﬁrst
time in four years has discovered a
student with a chest expansion of six
inches.

The remarkable gentleman is Con-
rad Etzel, a sophomore transfer stu-
dent from Clarion State Teachers’
College_ and a resident of Shippens-
ville, Pennsylvania. Etzel is rather
short, measuring just a few inches
more than ﬁve feet.

Of all the students examined by Dr.
Carlson and his staﬂ, the tallest was
reported as six feet, ﬁve inches, and
the shortest as an even ﬁve feet.

Tost Wins First
Cross-Country
Time- Trial Event

Red Tost, galloping hill-topper from
Plumville, loped home an easy victor
in the opening time-trials of the cur-
rent cross-country season to stamp
himself as the most promising “cure-
all” for Coach Olson’s pre-season
headaches.

George Cook, Charley Groat, and
Alex Leggin, respectively, pursued
Tost over the four-mile Flagstaff hill
course. Francis Theriault nosed out
Jack Emens for the ﬁfth position.

Harold Connelly, varsity track star,
placed seventh, followed by Gene
Powers, Andy Loncner, and Elliott
Montroll.

Tost, who has two more years of
competition, along with Cook, Groat,
Leggin, and Theriault, set the pace
for the ﬁrst mile. At the two-mile
mark, Theriault gradually dropped
behind the four leaders.

On the fourth and ﬁnal mile, Tost
slowly pulled away from the ﬁeld, ﬁn-
ishing the grind in the exceptional
time of 24 minutes, 51 seconds.

Not more than six seconds separat-
ed the next three men, Cook, Groat
and Leggin, who ﬁnished approxi-
mately 35 seconds out of ﬁrst place.
There will be a second time-trial be-
fore the opening meet at South Bend
according to Coach Olson.

Others to ﬁnish were: Herbert
Cummings, 11th; Jack Pfaff, 12th;
Steﬁnino, 13th; Walmsley, 14th; Mc-
Connell, 15th; Edmunds, 16th; and
Northup, 17th.

Yearling runners have also been
working out in preparation for a
strenuous schedule with the lead-
ing high school and freshman teams
of the tri-state district. It is not too
late to report for the freshman cross-
oountry, promises Coach Potts, as-
sistant coach.

Attractive Boxing Schedule Arranged

For Panther Mitt

Squad This Season

 

Coach Jack Schricker’s 1936 Pitt
boxing squad faces the most difficult
schedule ever arranged for a Panther
mitt team. Eight dual meets with
strong opponents have been sched-
uled, in addition to the ﬁfth annual
Eastern Intercollegite Boxing Confer-
ence tournament.

Starting training and preliminary

boxing instruction in the YMI-IA gym-

nasium tomorrow afternoon, Coach
Schricker hopes to have the mittmen
ready for their ﬁrst dual meet with
Syracuse on January 18.

All prospective freshman and var-
sity candidates are urged to report to
Schricker at the Stadium as soon as
possible.

Losing Captain James Giannatti,
Bernard Spiegal, and Joe Kopp, main-
stays of last season’s team, Coach
Schri_cker faces the difficult task of
ﬁlling these vacancies to buck the
stiff competition of the coming sea-
son. ll-Iowever, with Michael Sivak,

Al Paslowski, Milton Goldberg, Gene
Stoughton, George Dines, and Cleon
Linderman, members of last season’s
squad, expected back again in addi-
tion to Eddie Petrilla, Eddie Mc-
Adams, and Anthony Matisi, 1935 in-
tramural boxing tournament winners,

prospects for a good season are
bright. The new boxing facilities at

the YMI-IA should prove to be a big
asset to the 1936 mittmen.

The schedule of the eight dual
meets carded this year are:

Jauary 18—Pitt at Syracuse.

January 25—VVest Virginia at Pitt.

February 1—W. & J. at Pitt.

«February 15—Pitt at Catholic Uni-
versity.

February 21——Pitt at Wisconsin.

February 26—Temple at Pitt.

March 7—Pitt at Bucknell.

March 14——Tech at Pitt.

The date and place for the confer-
ence tournament will be determined
at a later date.

‘Touch’Games Begin Intramural Events

Intramural touch football competi-
tion opens Monday, October 14.
Leagues from Engineering, Medical,
Dental, Independent, and Greek
groups will swing into action at this
time.

This will be the ﬁrst year for touch
football on the Intramural program.
Delta Tau Delta is the defending
champion in the Greek division, with
Sigma Alpha Epsilon in the runner-up
role. League winners and second-
place elevens will enter an elimina-
tion tourney to play for the Intramu-
ral title.

Martin J. Feely, director of Intra-
mural athle‘ics, anticipates a large en-
try list, and therefore urges the re-
spective organizations to send their
p1ayer’s list as soon as possible. A fee
of $1 (one dollar) must accompany

each application for league member-
ship. This fee will help to defray
expenses incurred in making awards.

The Intramural touch football con-
tests will be played in accordance
with Inter-collegiate Football Rules
with the following exceptions: 1. In-
stead of tackling the ball-carrier, same
must be touched on the body, not the

arms. 2. The team gaining 15 yards
instead of 10 yards in four downs
shall earn a ﬁrst down.

Continuing: 3. The team shall
be composed of nine players—ﬁve
linemen and four backs. 4. The

kick-off may be either a punt or a.
place-kick from the 15-yard line. 5.
All blocking or body checking must
be done with the blocker having both
feet on the ground and hands off the
ground. 6. There shall be four pe-

Most Popular Soviet Film
Opening At The Cinema

“Chapayev,” the most popular ﬁlm
in Soviet history, which is playing at
the Art Cinema theater to capacity
crowds this Week, is based upon the
narrative by the late D. Furmanov,
who was the Commissar assigned to
the IRIed Commander in 1919, just as
the picture shows. Furmanov wrote
an account of the campaign, and from
it drafted the ﬁrst scenario. The
dr_aft was worked over in the military
department and the head office of the
ﬁlm trust, before ﬁnal production.

Professional cinema directors have
testiﬁed that only after seeing “Chap-
ayev” for the ﬁfth and sixth time
could they view it with sufficient de-
tachment to appraise its technical as-
pects.

Freshmen Say ‘Hello’
In Tea Dance Series

 

Freshmen wi1l'have a better oppor-
tunity to become acquainted with their
classmates at a series of ﬁve tea
dances, the ﬁrst of which will take
place on lvlonday, October 14.

Tentative plans have been made for
a dancing class in connection with
the dances. During the summer ses-
sion, these classes for men and wo-
men in social dancing proved success-
ful.

The entire freshman class will be
divided into groups, and each mem-
ber of the class will receive an invita-
tion to one of the dances. The fresh-
man women will get their tickets from
their senior mentors, and the men
from the upperclass counselors. Sen-
ior mentors and upperclass counselors
will act as hosts and hostesses at the
dances.

1VlissKalm Notes Sentiment
Against War Among English

Elaborate Ceremony Of Conferring Of Oxford Degrees

Impresses Instructor

By Jean Barnes

The English people do not want
war. This is the opinion of Miss
Theresa Kahn, instructor in English,
who has just come from a summer
spent in England and Scotland. Miss
Kahn went on to say that she believed
there would be a conflict between the
Englishman’s desire for peace, and his
love of his country and king.

“The English are even more nation-
alistic and patriotic than are the
Americans, but at present there is a
very strong peace movement afoot,
particularly among the students and
young people, called the New Oxford
movement. It would be hard, almost
impossible, to say which would win
out in event of a war. Socialism has
made great headway there, and Social-
ist measures are sponsored by the
conservative element.”

Miss Kahii also gave her per:-zonal
views of the economic situation there.

“There seems to be a great deal of
prosperity in Englaiid_.” she stated. “I
thiiik however that n-uch of it is sur-
face gilding, induced partly by the Ju-
bilee year.”

Miss Kahn went over to study in the
London Speech Institute under Miss
Marjorie Gullan. Miss Gullan was the
one to introduce choial speaking in
England, and it has become so popular
there that all English schools have
courses in it. It is spreading to
America, Miss Kahn having taught a
course in this subject at the Univer-
sity last year.

Besides studying in London, she
went to Oxford for a week to attend
the Verse Speaking Festival, and to
see the conferring of degrees. The
Festival was originated by John
Maseﬁeld, English Poet Laureate, and

During Visit Abroad

has been continued for several years
by prominent poets and speech teach-
ers.

The conferring of the degrees im-
pressed Miss Kahn as typical of the
Isinglisli people. The ceremony, which
has been used ever since the school
vas founded, is very elaborate and
is conducted in Latin. Every detail
is perfect, even to the color of the ties
the graduates must wear, yet the
whole ritual is carried on with the
utmost nouchalauce and indifference.
'l he proctors still stalk the aisles, and
should a student be ineligible for
graduation because of an unpaid bill
or for any other reason, the plaintiii
has only to stop the proceedings and
voice his objections. The ritual stops
and the Chancellor sits, chin in hand
while the objection lasts and is rem-
eciied.

‘unis ceremony is typical of the
Iinglisli,” said Miss Kahn, “because
ii. shows how they refuse to give up
any part of their past, any ceremonies
or traditions, yet are able to go
through them without effort.”

She found the people very kind,
however, and very well-posied, which
may be the reason for the assumption
that they are last to see a joke. She
found something else of interest, too.
’.i'he English women are not the
beauties the traditions and ads would
point them. Their complexions are
rot as beautiful as the Scotch wo-
men’s, and they are more dowdy than
their American sisters.

Said Miss Kahn, “There are more
middle-aged women in England than
here in America. Here most women
are strikingly young or strik“.ngly old.
but there at ﬁrst glance the whole

species seems middle-aged.”

Senior Court Meets,

Senior Court, judicial organization
of VVomeii’s Self Government Asso-
ciation, met as a body for the ﬁrst
time Monday afternoon to discuss the
function of the court for the coming
year. With Sylvia Fixel, C, as chief
justice; Ruth Seitz, Ed; Margaret
Lewis, G; Helen Rose Gibson, C; and
Roberta Nern, Ed, comprise the court,

Plans Year’s Affairs

I Plans were discussed for encourag-
ing the formation of a new Junta, or-
'g.'anization composed of me presidents
of all wonieii’s organizations. It was
suggested that this year’s Junta in-
clude the presidents of women’s fra-
ternities. This plan would help to
make better unity among all women’s
groups on the campus.

Aquatic Minded
‘Pitt Fins’ Plan
Swim Schedule

The Pitt Fins Swimming Club, or-
ganized last spring with the purpose
of promoting competitive swimmiig
among women, is plauiiing swimming
meets with teams from Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology, Pennsylvania
College for Women, Duquesiie, and
Slippery Rock State Teachers’ Col-
lege for the coming year.

The requirements for membership
in the club include ability in passing
a form test in any stroke, a speed
test, and water stunts, as well as
tests in uiving and distance. A Pan-
