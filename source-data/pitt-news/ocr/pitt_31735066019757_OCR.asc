Campus
police
arrest man
in Hillman
Library

By Nancy Brown
and Sue Felder
The Pitt News

An Oakland man was arrested
by University of Pittsburgh Police
Monday evening in Hillman
Library for trespassing.

The Hillman Library guard saw
Edwin H. Kimbo, 30, in the
library after he had been cited
and warned to keep off universi-
ty property by campus police in
March of this year.

" On March 29, officers detect-
ed a strong smell of marijuana
coming from a men's room in
Hillman and discovered Kimbo
in there alone. He did not have
any illegal drugs in his possession
at the time.

When asked for identification,
which he did not have, and told
to put his hands against the wall
by police, he refused and became
loud, disorderly and used ob-
scene language.

"He probably didn't take the
first warning very seriously,” said
Walt Waters, assistant director of
the Campus Police. ”Sometimes
people on the street don't think
our people can arrest them. They
keep challenging them until they
Q ‘get arrest .”'

Waters said that when Kimbo
was approached by police
officers, ”He [Kimbo] became
belligerent and quite verbal,”
Waters said. Kimbo, who is not
affiliated with the university, said
he was just interested in reading
books, according to Waters.

Kimbo had in his possession at
the time two library books that
had been checked out under a so-
cial security number different
than his own, according to the
police report. Police are still in-

lvestigating this matter.

Hillman usually doesn't have
”hard” crime, according to
Waters, but it does have some
problems with theft and vagran-
cy. ”We average about two ar-
rests a month at Hil|man,” he
said.

”Although I don't really mind
outsiders in the library,” said
Steve Petrogianni, a CAS junior,
”I didn't know they were allowed
to come in. I thought it was just

“for Pitt students and faculty.”

City Council hears debate on
Travelers Social Club raid  

By Christine Biancheria
Contributing Editor

A public hearing was held
yesterday morning before Pitts-
burgh City Council to look into
the raid conducted at Travelers
Social Club (a private, after-hours
club that caters predominantly to
the homosexual community) by
a task force of state police, city
police, Liquor Board agents and
Assistant Fire Chief Kevin Mellott
on Feb. 14.

The hearing was held in
response to a petition that was
circulated following complaints
of police brutality and illegal con-
duct during the raid. David
Stewart, a representative of Cry
Out!, a gay and lesbian action
group, said, ”The press has ig-
nored the incidents of violence
on the part of the State Police in
its coverage. This is one way they
cannot ignore it.”

Councilwoman Sophie Masloff
emphasized at the opening that,
since the hearing was not part of
a court investigation but rather
served as a public forum and in
light of a pending federal court
hearing on April 14, police
representatives were advised not
to attend or make a statement.

During the hearing, about 25
people gave testimony to the
events of Feb. 14 and offered sug-
gestions for measures which
would ensure that correct proce-
dures are followedby the task
force in the future. Among those
protesting police action were:
Jeanne Clark, candidate for the
State Senate; Marion Darnick, as-
sociate director for the American

Civil Liberties Union, Pittsburgh
branch; Attorney Jack Daugherty,
who defended CMU students ar-
rested in a recent raid held by the
same task force; and Randall For-
rester, executive director for Per-
sad Center (a counseling agency
for lesbians and gay men).

Suggestions included providing
sensitivity training for the task
force in dealing with minorities as
well as proposals that City Coun-
cil support an amendment to the
City's Human Relations Act so as
to include ”sexual orientation” as
a category protected from dis-
crimination.

Councilman Mark Pollock,
who recently wrote a letter to Pitt
President Wesley Posvar support-
ing the inclusion of sexual orien-
tation to Pitt's Equal Opportunity
Statement, stated after the hear-
ing that he had already testified
to the Human Relations Commis-
sion in favor of including sexual
orientation in the act.

Robert Johns, the club's
steward, was the first to address
Council. Describing the behavior
of the inspectors during the raid,
he said, ”Their conduct was in
the manner of storm troopers 
At no time did they identify them-
selves nor read anyone their
rights.”

Patricia Scanlon, chairperson of
the Pittsburgh Neighborhood Al-
liance, defended the task force,
citing complaints of double park-
ing at the cluband loud noise‘.

Scanlon, who said that ”this is
not a gay issue,” talked about the
necessity of the task force in com-
bating ”nuisance bars.”

Johns stated that the club,

which is situated in light-industry
district, not a residential area, has
existed for nearly 30 years, and
not once has it been issued a ci-
tation.

Scanlon conceded that an ac-
casion, the task force may have
displayed an ”excessive zeal.”

On the issue of procedure,
Daugherty said, ”Don’t cut away
the basis of our constitutional
process for the sake of expe-
dience ..."

Forrester questioned the exis-
tence of the task force and said,

”When one creates a Gestapo,

expect them to act like a
Gestapo.”

Councilman James Ferlo, in his
closing remarks, said he still sup-
ports the task force but stated,
”We wanted that task force to be
aimed at problem bars.  What
I'm very upset about, and
depressed about, is that their pri-
orities have gotten out of line. 
I think the mayor does have a
responsibility to speak out on this
issue, and I think we have a
responsibility to take corrective
action.”

Pollock also made closing re-
marks in which he apologized for
any involvement of the City's
police force in perpetrating the
incident.

The club, its steward and sever-
al members are filing suit against

the city police, the City and the

fire marshall as well as those state
police officers who were present
the night of the raid. At the court
hearing, they will seek injunctive
relief. According to John
Pushinsky, a Democratic commit-

Hijacked
Kuwaiti
airplane
flies to  
Algeria

By Hasan Mroue
Associated Press Writer

LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) ~ A
hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet took
off for Algeria early Wednesday,
after gunmen freed 12 more pas-
sengers in whatthey called a
gesture of goodwill.

The blue-and-white Boeing
747 left Larnaca at 1:17 a.m.
Wednesday (6:17 pm, EDT Tues-
day) with three members of
Kuwait's royal family still among
the hostages.

The Shiite Moslem hijackers,
who have killed two passengers,
had requested charts from the
control tower at Larnaca Airport
for the three-hour flight to the Al-
gerian capital.

When asked whether the air-
craft would be accepted in Algi-
ers, -a tower official said a telex
from Algerian authorities was
very definite. ”Yes, we will con-
firm that for you.” _ I

About 40 people, including the
six to eight hijackers, remained
aboard the Kuwait Airways jet. It
was commandeered eight days
ago on a flight from Bangkok to
Kuwait and spent three days at
Mashhad, Iran. It was subse-
quently allowed to land at Lama-
ca because it was running out of
fuel.

One of those freed said three
members of Kuwait's ruling fami-
ly, Fadel Khaled al-Sabah and his
sisters Anware and Ebtesam,
were still on the plane, said Dr.
George Olympios at Larnaca
General Hospital, where the
freed hostages were taken.

A nurse at the hospital said the
freed hostages ”seem to be OK.
There weren't any visible inju-
ries.” She added that they were
very tired.

Earlier in the day, the gunmen
said they had donned ”death
shrouds" and had renamed the
jetliner ”the plane of mar-
tyrdomi”

The 12 passengers walked off
the aircraft at 10:25 p.m. (3:25
p.m. EDT) and got into three am-
bulances as the flashing lights
from the plane and the emergen-
cy vehicles illuminated the
runway.

After the released passengers
left the plane, a hijacker told the

tower they were two Palestinians

Police smash ”virgin sacrifice” sex and drug cult

COALDALE, Pa. -— Additional
charges stemming from plans to
use a 12-year-old boy as a ”vir-
gin sacrifice” were filed against
two of six people accused of be-
ing involved in a sex and drug
cult, police said.

Coaldale Police Chief John
Tonkin has stressed that the
”sacrifices” were only sexual
acts.

Diane Marilyn Prentice Leon,
31, of Coaldale, and Ricky L.
”Cosmic Star” Card, 21, of Lans-
ford, were returned to Schuylkill
County Prison after their arraign-
ment Monday by District Justice
Andrew Zelonis of Tamaqua.

Zelonis raised the bail for each
suspect from $10,000 to $20,000

‘because of the new Charges.

Leon, Card and four others

a were charged last week with one

count each of criminal conspira-
cy, criminal solicitation, corrup-
tion of minors and distribution of
controlled substances to persons
under 18. Those charges resulted
from events earlier this month.
The additional charges filed
Monday included conspiracy,
solicitation and corrupting

minors.

Police documents said on
March 19, at the Leon home,
there was an attempt by Leon and
Ricky Card to solicit the 12-year-
old boy for a ”virgin party” to be
held July 4.

The document said the youth's
hands were to be chained above
his head, his clothing removed
and deviate sexual acts per-
formed upon him in that position.

Tonkin said Leon had initiated
four of the other suspects into her
cult but had not initiated
McLaughlin. Police identified
Leon as a ”princess,” or leader,
of the cult.

The initiations, Tonkin said, in-
volved sexual acts performed by.
the group during a ”chain ritual”
during which people would be
bound with chains and stripped
while the acts were performed.

Coaldale Patrolman Tim
Delaney said Leon and Richard
Card were arraigned on the addi-

tional charges after interviews
with the 12-year-old boy and two
other witnesses.

Men conning elderly

out of lots of money

PITTSBURGH — Teams of out-
of-state confidence men are prey-
ing on the city's elderly with a
scheme that has netted thousands
of dollars, police said. J

The groups have hit the homes
of at least six elderly people since
Saturday, they said, taking more
than $18,000 in cash and an un-
estimated number of valuables.

In most cases, the men have
passed themselves off as sidewalk
or driveway repairmen. They en-
tered victims’s houses by asking
for payment or for glasses of
water,.officers said Monday.

In one case, a group of men
offered to repair an 81-year-old
woman's cracked sidewalk for
$10, police said. After asking for
some water, the men entered the
house and stole $5,000 in cash
from an upstairs bedroom.

The thefts are a yearly occur-
ence, police said. They believe
the bands come from as far away

as New Jersey or Michigan. The
groups generally stay for two
weeks before moving on, police
said.

Marine killed in

Panama by gunfire

CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. -— A Ma-
rine on security patrol in Panama
has been killed, apparently by
gunfire from a fellow Marine, a
spokesman at the U.S. Southern
Command said Tuesday.

The Marine, a corporal, was a
member of I Company, 3rd Bat-
talion, 4th Marine Regiment,
which is based here and was sent
to riot-torn Panama last week,
said U.S. Air Force Col. Ron
Sconyers.

The name of the slain Marine
has not been released pending
notification of his family. He was
shot at least once in the stomach
and was pronounced dead at
1:10 a.m. Tuesday at Gorgas
Hospital in Panama.

Attempts to revive the Marine
with open-heart massage were
unsuccessful. Several major arter-
ies were hit by the bullet, and the
Marine suffered massive internal

Pitt to build parking garage

[gr Mindy Boffemmyer
Staff Writer

In response to the parking
needs of people working and
studying in Oakland, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and Presbyteri-
an University Hospital have
proposed the construction of a
seven-story parking garage and
sports center on Robinson Street.

The building will be paid for
atﬁ maintained by Presbyterian
Hospital, according to Jay Roling,
assistant to the vice—president of
Public Relations at Pitt. Construc-
tion of the garage will cost Pres-
by approximately $12.5 million.

The proposal is part of a $230
million university project to ex-
pand its medical health care fa-
cilities to include Presby and Falk
Clinic, said Roling.

’’Eventually, a science tower
will be built above the existing
Presby garage, and a 19-story ad-

'tion will be built above the ad-

employees of the proposed build-
ings before the project can con-
tinue, however.

Currently, Pitt is leasing about
1500 parking spaces in the Strip
District, Wilkinsburg and on the
South Side, where commuters to
university health facilities can
park and take a shuttle to and
from Oakland. This peripheral
parking program was started by
the university last Monday.

Local businesses approve of the
university's proposed plans but
are concerned about additional
traffic congestion in the Oakland

area.

The city Planning Commission
said that it must be assured that
parking problems will be solved
before it will make any recom-
mendations to City Council for
zoning approval. ”

Wilbur Smith and Associates
parking management company is

investigating additional traffic
congestion that may be caused by
the new garage.

Roling said that the garage on
Robinson St. should help to al-
leviate both parking and traffic
congestion problems since ”a lot
of the congestion in Oakland is
due to people who are unfamiliar
with the area and have to drive
around looking for spaces.”

”We need to provide con-
venient parking on a short-term
basis for patients,” Roling said.

Presently, tennis courts are lo-
cated on the proposed garage cite
owned by the university. Pitt will
lease this land to Presbyterian
Hospital on a long-term basis.

The sports center to be built
above the proposed garage will
include nine indoor tennis courts.
The center will also be able to be
converted for indoor football
practices.

Dukakis finds support
among Pitt students

By Mark R. Brown

* Staff Writer

Supporters for presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis
were campaigning on campus
yesterday during rush hour.
Relying on Dukakis’ apparent
popularity among students,
the supporters distributed liter-
ature to passersby and waved
posters at traffic on Forbes
Avenue.

Pitt junior Mike Epitropou-
los, the coordinator of the sup-
port group, said, ”l’ve checked
out the different candidates’
policies, and I agree with his
more than the others — not
that I'm 100 percent in agree-
ment with his.

”You can get his stand on
[campaign] issues on paper,
something that other candi-
dates don’t have available.
Whether you agree with him
or not, you decide that -
which is what elections are all
about,” Epitropoulos said.

Epitropoulos described
some of the accomplishments
Dukakis had as Governor of
Massachusetts, which include
the reduction of the number of

people on welfare in his state _

by one third.

”Dukakis is in favor of
negotiating arms treaties as
well as being in favor ofa bet-’
ter quality defense. He be-
lieves in investing in human

Maryland gun law

is a fine example

In Maryland, the state legislature has approved a measure that
would ban the sale of ”Saturday Night Specials,” guns that are
easily concealed and significantly cheaper than most handguns.
The governor of Maryland is expected to sign the measure into
law. I I

Under the new law, weapons which are made of cheap
materials, guns that are inaccurate and guns made chiefly of
plastic orceramics wouldbe banned from sale. Weapons whose
serial numbers have been removed or altered would also be
banned.

The Saturday Night Special ‘has traditionally been the gun
of choice among drug dealers and other criminals due to its
usually low cost. Guns will still be available, but they will be
more expensive and more difficult to obtain, hopefully decreas-
ing the number of guns in circulation.

We support this law completely.

The National Rifle Association lobbied members of the legis-
lature to oppose the measure, but their influence was insuffi-
cient to halt its passage. While some feel it is an unimpeachable
right of Americans to ”bear arms,” it might be helpful to remem-
ber that in many court cases, a personal liberty has been cur-
tailed to halt infringement on the rights of another.

By any standards, a gun is a potentially lethal device. Its func-
tion is to be lethal; it is designed to kill. As such, there need
to be significant restraints on the ease with which one can ob-
tain so deadly an object.

Good progress in
the BAS elections

The Black Action Society elected its new Chairperson, Celeste
Myers, and Deputy Chairpreson, Maria Kersey, last Thursday.
Myers and Kersey are surely cognizant of the image problems
the BAS has suffered due to recent controversies involving their
elections.

Increased student interest in the BAS is important if the or-
ganization hopes to be successful in the future.

Although it is not the normal way to pique interest, there's
little doubt that the publicity surrounding last year's controver-
sial election, and this year's initial failure to hold an election
has made more students aware of the organization's existence.

It is encouraging to see that the BAS has finally resolved its
problems, and this time around, the election went smoothly.
We wish Myers and Kersey the best of luck in their future ef-
forts, and hope that next year's election will come off without
a hitch.

Now it is the responsibility of BAS members to make sure
that adequate representation and involvement in their organi-
zation is achieved. “ »

On the good of psychedelics

It really is about time someone
spoke out rather loudly for the
legalization of ganja. Thank you,
Paul Anater. Marijuana use is not
on the decline, as we are obvi-
ously led to believe by the
government.
know here on campus smokes
ganja, with an exception of about
three people.

This doesn't mean that all my
friends are criminals, unless you
count smoking marijuana as a
criminal activity. But then, you
would have to count driving 56
mph a criminal activity also, you
know? I say we set a date for a
large-scale smoke-out to get some
awareness going on around here.
Let's do it in the commons room
of the Cathedral and let it spill out
onto the lawn, which I firmly be-
Iieve it would. It seems that Paul
started something here, so let's
keep it rolling.

Not only am I a firm believer
in the use of ganja, but in the use
of all _ psychedelics. Recently,
there has been a lot of bad pub-
licity going around on LSD. [...]
LSD was first synthesized in 1938
by Dr. Albert (not Abbie) Hoff-
man, although its actual effect
wasn't discovered until 1943.
Convinced of the power of this
drug, he dedicated his time to the
study of this and other psychedel-
ic drugs. Many people have
spoken or written on its effects,
and the one person most of us are
familiar with through classes is
Aldous Huxley. What we don't
learn in class is that Huxley was
such a believer in LSD that his
last wish, on his deathbed, was
to be injected with a 200 micro-
gram dose (by today's standards,
two hits) of LSD. He published
many pieces on psychedelics, the
most important being The Doors
of Perception, Heaven and Hell
and a novel, Island.

Psychedelics, including ganja,
are not merely ”fun,” as Paul
claims, but the most important
thing about them is that they truly
are consciousness—expanding,
and a little work on our cons-
ciousness is what we all need.

There are things starting to hap-
pen in this country and in the
world that are making some of us
think. Consciousness expansion

Everyone that I

LETTERS

is really on the rise, and accep-
tance of certain drug use (not co-
caine, not heroin, not
amphetamines) is coming
around. Watching television is
like watching a trip lately. Not
only does Pee Wee scream about
mushrooms and wear magic
glasses that make the room melt
and change colors, but even
prime—time shows have had talk
about ”getting picked up by the
cops in Connecticut while trip-
ping on acid.” [...]

Read anything by Carlos
Castaneda; read anything by
Huxley; read Ken Kesey’s One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (the
first chapter was written while he
was experiencing peyote). [...]

Just read anything, and get all

Wake up!

This is in response to the arti-
cle written by Paul Anater on
legalizing marijuana. First, I'd like
to say ”Go to hell” to Mr. Anater.
Second, I'd like to ask you, Mr.
Anater, if you were high when
you wrote this article. Don't you
know that when you try to per-
suade people, you should back
up your belief with some kind of
remarks that suggest what you are
trying to do is right?

You are trying, unsuccessfully,
to persuade ‘us that marijuana
should be legalized, but you have
no concrete arguments as to why.
Oh, that's right, it's ”fun and
meaningful.” What the hell kind
of statement is this? Murder can
be fun and meaningful to some
psycho; does this justify the act?
You also say people discriminate
against those who smoke when
you are guilty of discrimination
yourself.

Do you recall saying ”I' avoid
people who don't [smoke]"? I
used to smoke marijuana, but I

didn't find it fun and meaningful.
Therefore, I chose not to do it
anymore. I guess, in your opin-
ion, you wouldn't want anything
to do with me. That's OK, be-
cause I don't care to associate
with those who are so narrow-
minded.

An example of your narrow-
mindedness is when you admit to
taking a hit off a joint in a bar and

laughing about it since you knew‘ I

you could have been busted.
You're so cool, Mr. Anater. More
people like you should exist in
this world. Well, Mr.‘Anater, I'll
be the one laughing when you
get busted. [...]

I'm sorry to say, Mr. Anater, but
you do constantly contradict
yourself throughout the article. As
I said earlier, you say people dis-
criminate against you, but at the
same time, you do the same.
Then you say people who smoke
generally do not get violent and
commit crimes, and soon after
this statement, you say ’’people
should not smoke” if ”they’re go-
ing to end up hurting someone.”

Finally, I’d like to give Mr.
Anater some advice: When yo
feel something is right, back it up.
(And not by silly remarks such as
it's ”fun and meaningful”) And if
you do choose to do it this way,
give us some examples how so-
ciety could benefit — and not just
you and your crowd. Lastly, Mr.
Anater, when you do finally
graduate, why don't you smoke
a joint before the interview.
When they ask why you did that,
tell them, because it's ”fun and
meaningful.” I'm sure they'll un-
derstand. Good luck in finding a
job.

,Afghani problems remain

Keep an eye on the develop-
ments in Afghanistan if you
would, please. There's more to it
than meets the eye.

Take the peace talks in Gene-
va, for example. A few piecesvof
paper may or may not be signed
some time in the future, which
may or may not be worth the ink

ﬁn them. While the ink is drying
‘n those pieces of paper, will the
agreements on them be violated?
I'm afraid it is‘a distinct possi-
bility.

Let's look at the signatories to
some of these documents. While
some word has reached the
Western world that the hierarchy
in Moscow is in favor of divest-
ing Afghanistan and that a more
liberal trend is possibly influenc-

ing their decision making in"

general, why trust them? Call me
old-fashioned, but didn't the am-

gbition to unite the world into one

0‘

big happy worker's paradise
come out of Moscow?

I'm not being flippant.
Moscow's foreign policies tend to
(to borrow a phrase from Mao)
come out of the barrel of a gun,
at least some times. This paper's
editorial yesterday on Afghansi-
tan mentioned a toll of 100,000
lives in Afghanistan. That writer's
sources were in error. The horri-
ble reality of human suffering in
Afghanistan during the last nine
years totals one and a half million
dead Afghanis, and that's a con-
servative estimate. The loss to
Soviet troops is possibly 15,000
dead. The total wounded, miss-
ing, or emotionally scarred for life
for both sides is unavailable, and

" quite unbelievable.

MARK R.
BROWN

To call the Soviet invasion and
occupation of the sovereign na-
tion of Afghanistan a civil war is
a sad misnomer. The facts on the
matter of what led to the black
day of Dec. 27, 1979, are quite
clear, even to the legions of Le-
nin’s useful idiots, as he was fond
of calling his followers. Just be-
cause a puppet government was
installed and Afghanis _ were
pressed into armed service does
not make a civil war, nor does
buying out independent militia
units or disaffected rebels.

The civil war will begin once
the Red Army limps home and
their flunkies left behind are
slaughtered. Once they're out of
the picture, then the rebels
should start their old practice of
factionalism and tribal warfare,
but ‘more on that later.

Other parties involved in the
peace settlement include
Pakistan, which, despite their
good intentions to help out their
brother Moslems, can best be
described as a den of thieves. Last
year, word got out that Pakistan
ripped off nine out of 10 Stinger
missiles which we were supply-
ing to the Afghan rebels. And
Pakistan has thebomb, which
scares me as they haven't evolved
past open sewers in that lovely
country yet. I hope to be back in
that den of thieves next month,
and there's few people that I can
trust there. V

Back to the Afghan rebels. Let's

all see this one coming. There are
seven distinct, separate rebel
groups, each with their own
desires and ambitions. Within
each group, there are problems
between the political and military
branches, and even more difficul-
ties exist within local commands.

Some of these groups go after
each other, armed with state—of-
the-art weapons and an ancient,
warlike fervor. One group —-
Gubuldin Hekmaytar’s fun-
damentalist Hezbe party — has
picked up the worst reputation,
due to some odd coincidences in
the deaths of some journalists last
October — one of whom was a
buddy of mine who knew better
than to do business with them.
That particular group received $2
million in U.S. aid in 1987 alone.

If, and I mean if the Russians go
home, three of the fundamentalist
rebel groups are going to square
away against the four pro-
Western groups, and there is
nothing bloodier or scarier than
a civil war. If Persians are any-
thing like Arabs, that civil war
should be vicious and prolonged.

I do hope that Moscow divests
Afghanistan. There is a historical
precedence for the Soviets leav-
ing their politicals behind to be
slaughtered and not sending their

army back for payback, as evi-

denced in Iran in the 1940s.
Maybe Gorbachev’s Glasnostis
not just pretty words. I'm skepti-
cal. Perhaps the sanest way? to ob-
serve this would be to expect the
worse and hope for _the best.

Separating yourself from the job

I walked slowly down Fifth
Ave. on my way" home Sunday
night. It was close to 1:30 a.m.
and we just finished Monday's
paper at the William Pitt Union.
I have always dreaded the long
early morning walks back to my
apartment. Yet, on that morning,

the walk seemed very different.

I just finished writing a story
about a 42-year-old man from
Michigan who was killed on
Saturday night by a PAT bus.

The story was fairly simple and

. fit the typical, ”accident victim”
‘ mold, often referred to in in-

"

troductory newspaper classes.

The man was identified as
Robert M. Rairick of St. Clair
Shores, Michigan. Police specu-
lated that since Mr. Rairick was
from out of town, he didn't no-
tice the bus lane on Fifth Ave. At
around 8:30 p.m., Mr. Rairik was
hit and killed by an eastbound
bus.

The police considered it an ac-
cident, PAT is running a routine
investigation and life goes on.

It took me about 45 minutes to
finish the story. Everything
seemed pretty simple, except of
course, if_ you're Mr. Rairik.

Sounds heartless doesn't it? But
that's the attitude of the reporter.
Newspapers exist to provide the
cold facts. It wasn't my job to ex-
press any grief for Mr. Rairik. My
only concern was to get the sto-
ry in the paper.

In the process of getting the
who, what, when, where and
why of my story, I found out
something interesting about Mr.
Rairik. He wasn't in Pittsburgh on
vacation but visitng his wife, who

  

Mn
  nucum

was recovering from liver trans-
plant surgery at Presbyterian-
University Hospital. .

I didn't feel any sympathy for
Mrs. Rairik. I didn't have time to,
I was 15 minutes past deadline.
Besides, it would be distracting
and unproductive if I thought
about the people I was writing
about. I blocked Mrs. Rairick out
of my mind so that it didn't mat-
ter to me what she was feeling.

I didn't think too much about
Mr. Rairik either. He was merely
a victim on a police report and
the subject of my eight inch story.

After the story was completed
I sent out for pizza and resumed
editorial duties.

As the night went on, the
thought of Mr. and.Mrs. Rairik
kept coming back to me.

I started wondering. what he
was thinking about right before
he died. It's easy to say he was
worried about his wife. But what
if he was thinking about some-
thing totally different? Perhaps he

was concerned over his job, car
payments, baseball or who
would get best actor at the Acade-
my Awards.

Whatever it was, I'm sure his
family would want to know.

I started thinking about the last
conversation Mr. Rairik had with
his wife. What if they had a fight
or only talked about the weather?
How would they know that they
still loved each other?

Some people look at death as
a natural part of life; something
that is destined for all of us, right
down to the day and time. For
some reason, I can't find comfort
in that.

It was very quiet in Oakland
that Sunday night. I took the Fifth
Ave. route home and couldn't
find any sign of life on the road
or around me. The university
lookeddeserted and I stared at
the sidewalk trying to imagine
Mr. Rarik walking to his death
near MeyranlAve.

As I came closer to Meyran
Ave. I shifted my stare to the bus
lane on Fifth. I walked all the way
to Chesterfield Ave. and found no
visible sign of Mr. Rarik’s pain or
blood. The street was cleaned

. and appeared like it always did.

In the last few days I've thought
a lot about Mr. and Mrs. Rairik.
As I re-read my story in last Mon-
day's paper, I feel more like an in-
truder than a reporter. Mr.
Rairik’s life was more than wiped
up blood on Fifth Ave., and cer-
tainly more than an eight inch
story.

Death is a little more real to me
now and to anyone who knew

Mr. Rairik, I'm sorry.

Good help can be
so tough to find

Just a year ago, when the
first political reporters start-
ed drifting into my
hometown to find out
about this guy Dukakis, a
Washington colleague of
mine asked what the gover-
nor’s weakness might be as
president. I said then that it
might be his deep, even ir-
rational, belief in reason.

Dukakis is a man who
might have trouble under-
standing the great emotion-
al ”isms” rocking the
world. He is wary of pub-
lic passions, doesn't entirely understand their power.

So it was with the domestic breed of ”ism,” Jacksonism: a
powerful mix of populist sentiment, black pride and flat-out
charisma. Dukakis was his most uncomfortable self in the days
before the Wisconsin victory. The more Jackson seemed to ex-
pand —— his voice, his embrace — the more Dukakis seemed
to contract. Jackson hugged, Dukakis shook hands. V

If Jackson demanded passion from a crowd, Dukakis flinched-
from public displays. He wanted listeners, not lovers.

  

EI.I.

There has rarely been a starker comparison between candi-
dates, and I do not mean in skin color. Jackson pitches to the
heart, Dukakis to the head. Jackson exudes: ”I am somebody.”
Dukakis explains: ”I am what I am." More to the point, Jack-

’ son plays to the impulse buyer, Dukakis to the cautious, price-

reading, comparative shopper.

So the victory in Wisconsin must be particularly sweet to '
Dukakis. Because in a sense, he won it his way.

Remember the marathon metaphor? For most of this season,
the governor has compared the campaign to that endurance con-
test, that competitive sport of loners. But recently, he has be-
gun talking about boxing.

The campaign, he said, on the night of his Wisconsin victo-
ry, was going the full 15 rounds and there would be no knock-
out; he would win inpoints. In Wisconsin he did just that. Point
One: Who can beat Bush? Point Two: Who has the experience
in government? Point Three: Who can do the job?

”After seven years of charisma," said Dukakis, ”isn’t it time
for competence?” Not the sort of sentiment you usually find
on a candidate's bumper sticker, but it dealt head on with _the
issue of emotion in politics.

Is it an imperative, as Jackson suggests, for leaders to physi-
cally connect with citizens, for candidates to attract voters into
their circle of believers? Is the powerful emotional surge — in-
cluding the one that comes from a black man breaking through
the barriers of racism — a compelling plus? Or is there also
something to be wary of in a mass chanting of rhymes and
slogans?

We have seen it work both ways. The energy. and passion
that impels a movement. The loss of individuality, the giving
up of reason that empowers a demagogue. The Jackson cam-
paign struck at the ambivalence many voters felt about the pas-
sion issue. ' ' l

Dukakis was in the curious yet genuine position of remind-
ing voters to think about what they felt, to resist going with the

flow, the big Mo, chanting the chorus of ‘Jesse's compelling

refrains. He asked voters not to be swept off their feet. Not by

Jackson. And also not by him. It is an extraordinary request from ‘

a politician, but one that fits seemlessly into his own life.

Last week, I heard someone remark that Jackson would be
a great date, but Dukakis would be a better husband. It's stead-
iness that he's selling. It is no accident that he chosethe emo-
tionally charged Kitty as wife, or that Kitty Dukakis chose his
steadiness. In the years before his brother's accidential death,
when that brother was quite simply emotionally ill, Dukakis
was always the steady one. I

There is another marital analogy I have heard. Who was it
that said that George Bush reminded every woman of her first
husband? There is no charismatic competition there. But a
Brookline neighbor says that Dukakis reminds a woman of her
second husband. He's the one she got to know slowly. The one
she looked at long and hard, picked carefully with her eyes wide
open.

This is how Dukakis is wooing the Democratic Party. He
doesn't expect‘ to sweep her off her feet. He wants to win on
points.

‘Senior’

By Lorey Kelley
Staff Writer

In case you haven't noticed,
there's a new breed of students
rapidly emerging on Pitt's
campus.

According to Janice White,
director of the College for the
Over 60 program, ”senior” stu-
dent enrollment has doubled in
the past three years.

”There are over 400 students in
our program. It has grown
200-and-some students since I've
taken over," said White, the pro-
gram’s director for three years.

The College for the Over 60
program was created in 1974 in
order. to give those 55-years-old
and up a chance to audit under-
graduate classes. The program is
listed under the College of
General Studies, but courses are

. offered from the College of Arts

and Sciences.

”We [CGS] do all the paper-
work here and that's why the pro-
gram is listed under our
department,” said White.

Courses are picked randomly
from each department by White,
who then gets approval from
each instructor to place ”senior”
students in their class. In an
average—size class, there can be
up to four senior students. In a
large class, there can be up to 40,
according to White.

Students’ ages range from the
mid-50s to the mid-80s.
”Seniors” must apply to take
courses during university registra-
tion periods. They are charged
$10 per course and may take as

many courses as they like, ac-

cording to White.

The average number of classes
taken per student is two.

ic and World Politics are the most
popular courses.

”They fight to get into those-

courses because the instructors
are so good,” said White.

Whether they are taking class-
es to obtain a degree, or auditing
classes, ”senior” students at Pitt
find college to be an enriching
experience.

”Going to school has opened

— a whole new field to me. I never

knew I could be so involved. It
broadens my horizons. It keeps
me young and alive. It keeps my
brain from stagnating,” said
70-year-old Hazel Albert.

”Your mind is stimulated ,[in
class] and you always learn some-
thing new,” said 65-year-old
Carol Manes.

”lt [education] has given me
confidence that I still have some-
thing upstairs," said 60-year-old
Bernice Berg.

No one has to tell these stu-
dents the importance of educa-
tion. As a matter of fact, they are
quite outspoken about it.

”Without education, you are

lost in today's world, because the-

world keeps changing,” said
Manes, who is auditing an En-
glish literature class this term.

”Back in my day, girls didn't go
to college much. I think it is the
thing to do. It's there, why not
make use of it? Education is
something no one can take away
from you in life, no matter what
field you end up in. It gives you
a much broader outlook on life,”
said Albert, who is auditing two
English literature courses this
term.

”Senior” students make the de-
cision to come back to school for
a variety of reasons.

”I’d always wanted to finish my
degree, but I was a homemaker

and I had four children. My chil-,
dren are all grown now and re-
cently my husband died; we

were very close. I decided to

come back to school to keep me

going,” said Berg, who is pursu-

ing a bachelor's degree in

nutrition.

”I’ve always audited courses
since I've been out of school to
keep my mind active,” said
Manes, who has a master's
degree in English and histoq—
from Pitt.

”My husband died and my
granddaughter, who is a student
at Pitt, told me, ’Come on Grams,
you’re going to school,’ ” "said
Albert.

”Seniors” have found their fa-
milies and fellow students at Pitt
to be very supportive.

”My family thinks it's great. At
first I thought that they'd [Pitt stu-
dents] look at me and wonder
’what’s she doing here?’ but they
didn't. I've found that everyone
accepted me,” said Albert, who
has been taking classes at Pitt for
three years.

While they do enjoy college,
”seniors” admit that it is rigorous.

”There is more to learn now,
and the semesters are shorter than
when I was in school before. That
makes studying more intense.

”Chemistry is also much more
difficult. Now they're taking
atoms apart. Learning to walk up
and down those hills by the Pub-
lic Health building took some
getting used to,” said Berg, who
is a sophomore at Pitt.

Not only are ”seniors” benefit-
ting from taking classes, but so
are their classmates and their in-
structors.

”A lot of times, instructors will
call on them to tell some of their
experiences. Some of my stu-
dents who are Jewish have lived
through the holocaust and they
can tell about personal ex-
periences,” said White. A

”I’m teaching my instructor.
He suffered from severe stiffness
in his joints and he didn't know
what was wrong,” said Berg. ’’It
has been my experience that flou-
ride is very dangerous to the
body. I told him to eliminate it
from his diet. He did and now
he's playing tennis. Before, he
could hardly move.”

Raid

Continued from page 1
teeman from the 14th ward who
spoke at the hearing yesterday
and who will be representing the
club in the suit, said that such an
injunction would prevent similar
action on the part of the police
from occurring in the future.

Of the upcoming litigation,
Johns said he believes the
prospects are grim. He stated no
other gay bar that has taken legal
action against police for miscon-
duct during a raid has remained
in operation, adding that the club
had already received several
visits from various inspectors
since the night of the raid. He
also said that thus far, the lawsuit
has cost the club nearly $30,000
and that if they lose on April 14,
they will not be able to afford an
appeal.

Forrester also emphasized that
many witnesses are afraid to tes-
tify for fear of losing their jobs be-
cause, as he told Council, the
City does not currently provide
them with protection.

Kimbo, who was acting as
chairman of the meeting, said
that in the area of the Bradford
campus there is ”no easy access

He also added that approxi-
mately a year ago, a request for
a vending area for condom
machines on main campus was
made. After being reviewed by
Dr. ‘Posvar’s executive-board, this
vending area was found to be un-
necessary. ,

Michelle Jedlica, Panhellenic
President, said ”condoms should
be in machines.The Health Serv-
ice is not open at night, the time
most students would need
condoms.”

She also added that ”the issue

[of safe sex] can no longer be put
in the closet.”
In other business, SGB member

Kurt Toll said the Government .

Relations Committee of the SGB
are assisting in an effort to or-
ganize the student governments
of Pitt, Penn State and Temple to
form a coalition in-the state legis-
lature to lobby for additional
higher education funding.

Toll said, ”We want totake a
role in Pitt's budget process. This
is the first year for a coalition in
the legislature.”

Also, a request was made by
Jackson to list.student’s QPA’s on
grade reports and transcripts as it
is not done at the present time.

’’It would be more convenient

r condom ma chines

for students and advisors if tran-
scripts had QPA’s on them," Jack-
son said.

A representative from the
Registrar said Pitt operates on a-

I ”manual system” right now, and

that there would be ”no easy way
to get the QPA’s done given the
present system.”

The representative said that Pitt
plans to change to an on-line sys-
tem that would allow the QPA’s

' to be listed. This system would go

into effect in September of 1990.

The grand total for Greek Week
was announced and committee
members were told that the greek
system is in the process of select-
ing a charity for next year's Greek

Retired General Jack Merritt,
former U.S. representative to
the NATO Military Commit-
tee, recently spoke in Pitts-
burgh on the security of
Europe after the recent
removal of intermediate range
missiles by the INF treaty.

”We’re in a transitional
phase, especially for interna-
tional security affairs. Impor-
tant events such as the
Washington Summit have led
to Reykjavik and the INF ratifi-
cation. These indicate Gor-
bachev as a responsible
leader,” said Merritt.

General speaks on INF Treaty

Merritt spoke on public op-
position to the missiles’
deployment both in the Unit-
ed States and abroad. ”People
have asked if NATO was 16 4’
countries in search of a crisis,”
he said. ”Others asked if
NATO was hiding behind U.S.
nuclear weapons.”

Merritt said that following
the deployment of the Persh-
ing 2 and the GLCMs to
NATO, the Soviets returned to
arms negotiations which they
walked out of the year before.
The INF treaty could be
viewed, because of that, as a
success for NATO, said Mer-
ritt. He added, ”There are

siles in return for 400 of ours,”

balance of conventional forces
in Europe, which now favors
the Soviets. Fortunately, we
still retain our submarine-
launched missiles.”

Merritt went on to say that
”removing the Soviet missile
threat from the Channel ports
and our reinforcing airfields
was a good move. We can de-
fend against aircraft but not
against missiles. The ‘Soviets
give up 1,500 to 1,600 mis-

he said. I

Merritt stressed that despite
the INF treaty, the United
States must still be cautious of
the Soviet Union.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 13, 1988

By Michael Blood 4

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — Legisla-
tion was introduced in the
Senate on Tuesday that would
revise the process for electing
judges and also make changes
in the way allegations of judi-
cial misconduct are handled.

Sen. Stewart Greenleaf, the
Montgomery County Republi-
can who introduced the bills,
also criticized Gov. Robert P.
Casey for ”dragging his feet”
on judicial reform in the state.

Greenleaf’s proposals come
some 12 weeks after the ad-
ministration's judicial reform
commission made a series of
recommendations to revamp
the state's judiciary. Green-
leaf’s proposal embodies some
of the recommendations of the

commission.

’’It has been three months
since the governor's commis-
sion concluded its work. This
legislation is an effort to put
the issues the commission ad-
dressed out on the front burn-
er before this legislative
session draws to a close,”
Greenleaf said.

Specifically, the four-bill
package would:

0 Replace the Judicial In-I

quiry and Review Board with
a two-branch system, a board
of complaints and a nine-
member judicial court. The
bill would also require finan-
cial disclosure by members of
the judiciary, court employees
and government attorneys.
, 0 Establish a I5—member ju-
dicial council that would
make recommendations to the

New legislation to elect judges

courts and the Legislature to
improve the justice system.

0 Establish statewide and lo-
cal commissions to review ju-
dicial candidates prior ‘to
elections.

0 Provide for a binding
statewide referendum, if ap-
proved for the ballot through
petition, that would ask voters
to choose whether judges
should be elected by voters or
appointed.

”Although other proposals
have been introduced previ-
ously on these issues, my hope
is that since tvvoof these bills

are based on recommenda- I

tions of Gov. Casey's commis-
sion on judicial reform, they
will stand a better chance of
passage in the House,” Green-
leaf said.

Meese offered friend
an advisory position “

By Pete Yost

Associated Press Writer ,

WASHINGTON — Attorney
General Edwin Meese III neglect-
ed to mention in an FBI interview
on the Wedtech scandal Justice

Department job discussions he,
had had a few weeks earlier with

Wedtech consultant E. Robert
‘Wallach, Meese’s attorney said
Tuesday.

Meese was interviewed in the
Wedtech probe by the FBI on
April 17, 1987, just over a week
after being informed that long-
time friend Wallach was under
criminal’ investigation in the mat-
ter. A week or so before being
notified of Wallach’s status,
Meese had asked Wallach
whether he was interested in be-

, coming counselor to Meese at the

Justice Department.

Meese lawyer James Rocap
said. an FBI agent on April 17
asked Meese a question that ”was
broad enough to elicit the coun-

I selor job." But Meese at the time

was ”focusing on an earlier peri-
od” and perceived the question
to relate to whether Wallach Gn-
sidered taking a job during
Meese’s early tenure as attorney
general in 1985.

Meese thought about the FBI
interview overthe weekend and
the following week, on his own
initiative, informed the agent of
the counselor job discussions.

, ”He didn't make a conscious
decision during the FBI interview

to withhold the information,” i

said Rocap. When he talked to
the agent a second time, Meese
also informed the FBI that he and
Wallach had discussed possibiy
creating an advisory commission
in 1986 on which Wallach would
serve to examine the administra-

For The Pitt News

The Pitt Band has been taking
great measures in the last few
weeks to increase membership
and recruit new members for the
marching and concert bands.

Dr.O’Nei|l Sanford, band
director, has decided to push
recruiting for the upcoming year,
due to low membership since he
took over as band director.

Sanford has concentrated his
efforts on making the bands more
visible to high schools and the
public in general. An example of
this is the concert band's recent
tour where they performed at An-
napolis High School and will pm
form at Bethel Park High School.

Carol Dodd, current band
member, said, ”Dr. Sanford has
been concentrating his recruiting
at the high schools. I feel that if
he tried hyping the band more on
campus, more current Pitt stu-
dents would join.”

Sanford has sent out advertise-
ments to high schools and junior
high schools in Pennsylvania.
Dave Moy, associate director of
the band, said, ”We are trying to

’ display the multi-faceted aspects
of the band program that will pro- 9
vide our students an opportunity
to enrich their musical ex-
perience on a college level.”

Q: I met a perfect guy for me,
and we started dating. We make
excellent love together. .But on
our second date, we found out
that we are second cousins. We
are worried about this because of
our religion. What is your opin-
ion about sex with your second
cousin? /5 it really illegal?

A: I don't know the law in ev-
ery religion or every country or
state, but I have heard of one
against sex or marriage between
first cousins in some states. You
don't have to pay a lawyer to find
out the law on this in your state.
Your town or city clerk's office
can inform you on civil marriage
laws in your state, and a clergy-
man will be quick to inform you

about marriage rules in your

religion.

Q: I had some lunches with a
man in my office — probably a
bad idea —- but I have heard a lot
about how the workplace is
where mates meet nowadays. For
me, it seems to work out badly.

This man came on strong about
sex, and that put me off. He was
attractive, of course, but I always
want things to go moreslowly. I
decided that he was notseeking
a real relationship but just want-
ed to find out ifl was up for some
convenient sex. So I was definite-
ly discouraging, and the lunches
came to an end. I wish he were
more serious, but I thought that
was that. l _ . V .

Lo and behold, he took up with
another woman — and what do
they have but a terrific ongoing
relationship. It shows all over
them how they like each other

and mean to go on with it. And
I am heartbroken, jealous and
thinking about him all the time.
Was I wrong to discourage him
so? Was he looking for a relation-
ship, and if that was so, why
didn't he show it? How could I
have handled this differently?

DR. R'Il'l'l-I
WESTHEIMER

A: Well, I think you could have
shown that you like him, but in
spite of that liking you had your
own ideasabout your life and
how you wanted to run it.‘ You
can tell a man that you want a
slowly growing companionship
and love interest, not lightning
sex with a stranger. That you
want to meet men as potentially
serious," long-term parts of your
life, and to go cautiously with
them. That you understand sexu-
al attraction, and you feel it, but
you have ideas and plans.

Often men who come on
strong sexually will think, ”OK,
maybe this woman is worth
spending time with and getting to
know —— who knows?” That can
be a beginning when he was
originally looking for a fast end-
ing in bed. But don't blame your-
self. You disliked his approach,
and you had a right to show that. .
It's just that maybe he learned
from you and went more cau-
tiously with the other woman.

You can learn from your ex-
perience with him, too — but
don't get the idea that he would

have necessarily stayed with you '

because you went to bed with
him. There is no guarantee of that
at all, even if you are terrific in
bed.

Q: I have been in a weird rela-
tionship for several years with a
woman who won't have sex. She
says she doesn't want to have sex
with anyone. That makes her
different from me. What can I do?
I am devoted to her; I have never
run around on her. It is as if we
have a real understanding that
we are a couple, but she won't
make plans and she won't have
sex. I am tired of thinking about
her and gratifying myself, but I
really don ’t want to give her up.

A: You should talk about this to
some kind of counselor you trust.
Because you really should make
up your mind that this is a friend-
ship you depend on but that will
never be completely satisfying to
you because you want more out
of it. You have to get into a frame
of mind where you can face the
facts. Write your woman friend a
letter and say you need a wom-
an who wants to be a lover or a
wife —-— that you want her friend-
ship but you have other needs.
You just may not get into that
frame of mind without some out-
side help.

Q: My lover and I are in our
505 and willing to meet each
other’s needs sexually. I have
trouble telling him I don't like
anal sex. He is seldom able to cli-
max except using oral or anal.
How can I tell him? I don't want

to create the impression of being

offended by what he wants.
A: But you don't like it. Right?

Relationship questioned by intimate cousins

You absolutely should not take
part in anal intercourse, that be-
ing true. You don't have to say
this in any harsh or denigrating
way. Speaking fondly, say you
have tried it, you are willing, and
it seems that this is not something
you like. You would rather: ex-
plore other ways. ‘

Geta copy of The joy of Sex by
David Reuben, and try other

things. Some position for vaginal‘

intercourse can probably be
found that will offer your lover
better contact. If he seems to con-
tinue to be unhappy with your
shared sex life you might suggest
visiting a sex therapist with him
for a little counseling.

Officers charged with conspiracy Hijack

By Peter Mattiace

Associated Press Writer

PITTSBURGH —- A former as-
sistant district attorney and a
suburban police officer were
among 28 Pennsylvania and
Florida residents charged Tues-
day in a conspiracy to distribute
about 440 pounds of Colombian
cocaine over four years, authori-
ties said. ‘

Perry C. Perrino, 32, of
Homestead, an Allegheny
County assistant district attorney
from February 1986 to January
1987, and Mark D. Nicklow, 36,
a North Versailles police officer,
gave ”aid and comfort to mem-
bers of the conspiracy by provid-
ing information entrusted to them
in their capacities as public offi-
cials,” authorities said.

The 28 men and women were

charged by a federal grand jury -

with 113 violations of federal nar-
cotics, weapons and income tax
laws, said U.S. Attorney J. Alan
Johnson.

Johnson and state Attorney
General Leroy Zimmerman said
the indictments, handed up
Thursday and announced Tues-

day, show a link between or-_

ganized crime, drug dealing,
gambling and loan sharking.

Johnson, whose office has"

specialized in drug trafficking
prosecutions, termed the indict-
ments ”one of the most important
cases we've had here.”

”We’ve delivered a pretty good
punch to drug trafficking,” Zim-
merman said. I

”We could do this every day of
the week,” he said, referring to
the amount of cocaine trafficking
in the state.

Perrino was ”let go” as an as-
sistant district attorney after
authorities learned of an alleged
link with targets of the drug inves-

tigation, said Allegheny County ’

District Attorney Bob Colville.

”That association was brought
to our attention, and we immedi-
ately confronted Mr. Perrino,”
Colville said. ”That’s why he was
let go.”

N icklow, a police officer for 11
years, was suspended immediate-
ly after the indictments were an-
nounced Tuesday, said North
Versailles Acting Police Chief Ed
Steliga.

”He won't be back to work,”

Steliga said.

Perrino and Nicklow were also
each charged with one count of
distributing cocaine. Nicklow
was charged with three counts of
using a telephone in a drug con-
spiracy and one count of filing a
false tax return. ‘

Authorities said Joseph Rosa,
29, of Pittsburgh, and William
Kostrick, 42, of McKeesport, or-
ganized the alleged drug ring and
distributed, the Colombian co-
caine from sources in Florida,
New York and elsewhere over
four years. They said Ronald R.
Plisco, 37, of Monroeville,
financed the alleged conspiracy.

Two Florida residents, Jorge
Diaz,_ 49, of Circle Belle Glade,
and William Duane Smith, 40, of
Sarasota, were charged with
seven counts and five counts of
cocaine distribution, respective-

J ly, according to authorities.

The other 21 people indicted
are all from the Pittsburgh
metropolitan area and face vari-
ous charges.

Johnson said several of those-

charged had yet to be arrested. '_

with Jordanian passports and 10
others of unannounced national-
ity who were sick, poor or whose
families had numerous children.

Calling the release a ”good-
will” gesture, the hijackers said
the Jordanian nationals were
freed as a ”present to the upris-
ing in Palestine,” the 4-month—o|d
Arab rebellion in Israeli-occupied
territories.

The hijackers have demanded
that Kuwait free 17 pro-Ira-nian
terrorists, all but one of them
Shiites, convicted for a chain of
bombings there in December
1983. Kuwait refuses.

Negotiators from the Palestine 1

Liberation Organization and the
Cyprus government had gone to
the airliner earlier in the day. A
fuel truck flanked by ambulances
drove to the jet.

The jetliner was comman-
deered April 5 after it took off
from Bangkok, and was diverted
to the northeastern Iran city of
Mashhad, where 57 passengers

were-rsLsa§€d:

It left Mashhad on Friday, and
flew around the Mediterranean
for more than three hours as the
pilot desperately sought permis-
sion to land at airports in Damas-

cus and Beirut. He finally was

allowed to land ‘in Larnaca,
where the gunman killed two
men identified as Kuwaitis on
Sunday and Monday, and
dumped their bodies from the jet.

. PLO leader Yasser Arafat indi-

, cated there was ‘some involve-

ment by high-ranking officials
from Algeria to end the crisis, but
it was not known what kind of
deal had been struck.

Arafat, speakingin Kuwait, also
said PLO officials had been
”negotiating with the hijackers’

command in Beirut” to end the ‘V

hijacking,’ the Kuwait News
Agency reported. .
Tuesday, a hijacker spoke to

the control tower, citing verses ‘

from the Koran, Islam's holy
book, which are normally read at
funerals. _

”Those killed in the name of
God are ‘always alive,” the
hijacker said.

stand on an improved student
work loan program.” said
Epitropoulos.

The group of Dukakis sup-
porters were mainly Pitt stu-
dents, although Carnegie
Mellon students and a profes-
sional campaigner were there
to lend a hand.

Robert Morrow is a full-time
Dukakis supporter from Alaba-
ma who came here to work
before the Pennsylvania

primary election.
”He’s been a fantastic

governor and will probably
make a great president," said
Morrow. ”He has a proven
track record, having been
elected governor from '75 to
'79, and from '83 to present.
He has an excellent record in
favor of education, but what I
like the most is his sensible
foreign policy ideas, unlike the
Reagan administration’s.”
CMU senior Chuck Jain-
chill, who hosts a Monday
night political program on ra-
dio station WRCT, said,
”Since Babbitt dropped out,
I've been supporting Dukakis.
’’I don't like Gore b ca se

      

of Gore's wife's stand on cen-
sorship. In the upcoming
primary, I think Dukakis will
do well among the students.
So far, I've had a dozen stu-
dents volunteer to campaign
for him, and a few dozen
others voiced their support.”

Jainchill said that a debate to
be held on the CMU campus
was verbally agreed on by
Jesse Jackson and Dukakis,
and that Gore has not said for
sure that he would be there.

”Gore is probably waiting
for the outcome of the New

York primary.” said Jainchill.

that he favors putting up a guard
rail or a wall to protect residents
from the bus lanes. ’’I am a resi-
dent, and I am still frightened of
the bus lanes,” he said.

In response to a recent fatal ac-
cident on Fifth Avenue, Pitts-
burgh City Council has requested
a legal opinion from the City Soli-
citor’s office about the Fifth
Avenue bus lanes.

The accident involved the
death of a 42-year-old Michigan
man who was hit by a PAT bus
on Fifth Avenue last Saturday
night.

Councilman Jack Wagner said
there has to be a dialogue be-
tween city agencies to find a so-
lution to this problem. ”There
have been too many tragedies,”
said Wagner.

Calipari a candidate for UMass posion

By Matt Martin
Assistant Sports Editor

When Pitt's basketball season
ended with a 80-74 loss to Van-
derbilt in the second round of the
NCAA Midwest Regional, most
of the Panther coaches settled
into their usual off-season regime
— scheduling, preparing for sum-
mer camps, and recruiting.

Assistant coach John Calipari,
normally Pitt's recruiting coordi-
nator and on-court instructor,
found himself in a new situation,
however — as a recruit, not a
recruiter.

The University of Mas-
sachusetts tabbed Calipari, 29, as
a possible replacement for form-
er UMass coach Ron Gerlufson,
who resigned after a 10-17 sea-

son and a season-ending loss to
Duquesne in the first round of the
1988 Atlantic 10 Tournament.

”l’ve been interviewed, and
I'm waiting to hear from them,”
Calipari said. ‘'1 hope to hear
something in the next few days.”

UMass Athletic Director Frank
Mclnerney wasunavailable for
comment. 4

Massachusetts conducted two
interviews with Calipari, one in
Amherst, Mass., and another in
Pittsburgh last week.

’’It’s not final. I'm just a finalist.
I don't know if I'll take it if it's
offered,” Calipari said. ”l’m
definitely interested, but there's a
lot of things to consider.”

Calipari, a Moon High School
graduate, said he wanted his wife
to visit Massachusetts before he

made any decision.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
reported Tuesday that University

Senior Zeke Gadson will be trying his luck in the NFL draft later this month.

By Vince Longo
Staff Writer

If Monday's match against
Edinboro was any indication, the
final three matches of the Pitt
men's tennis season will be more
difficult than expected.

Last Saturday, the Panthers’ Vi-
vek Kumar predicted that their
three remaining matches — Edin-
boro, Mercyhurst and Buffalo —
would be decided, one way or

the other, by a score of 5-4.

Edinboro decided Kumar was
not a psychic, beating the Pan-
thers, 6-3, and leaving Pitt with
a 10-8 record.

Though Edinboro may have
been better than initially thought,
sophomore Neil Meyerowich is
not making excuses.

.”We knew they were pretty
good. We knew they were
tough.” ’

Freshman Jeff Mills indicated

that nearly all the members of the
team may have played something
less than the best match of their
careers.

”Neil played pretty good, but
none of the guys I talked to
[thought we] played too well.
They were better than we ex-
pected."

In singles play, Meyerowich
defeated Lars Carlsson 6-3, 3-6,
7-5; Mills lost to Rob Sirca 2-6,
7-5, 0-6; and Greg Campbell lost

Basketball Association and Na-
tional Basketball Asscociation
fame as ”Dr. J.” Unfortunately,
UMass hasn't had much succes
since Erving left. The Minutemen
have not enjoyed a winning sea-
son since 1977-78, under the
direction of Jack Leaman.

Gerlufsen’s five year record at
the university was 55-84.

Calipari, on the other hand, has
known nothing but success. He
came to Pitt in 1985 after a three-
year stint as assistant to Ted
Owens and Larry Brown at the
University of Kansas.

Calipari was also a two-year let-
terman at the University of North
Carolina (Wilmington), but
finished his collegiate basketball
career as the starting point guard

Gadson ready to step
into defensive back
role for pro career

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

In this version of the Pitt foot-
ball program's long—standing rela-
tionship with the National
Football League draft, the only
name to receive any solid public-
ity from the Panthers’ program in
1988 has been running back
Craig ”lronhead” Heyward, who
recently won his appeal for eligi-
bility in this year's selection
process, and could become an
eventual Top 10 pick.

But before it's all over, another
Pitt product could easily emerge
as a gold nugget find, a steal of
a deal, on an NFL roster.

Zeke Gadson.

You all remember Gadson,
don't ya? The guy who played
handball with the helmets of
quarterbacks all season long?
Zeke freaked on opposing QBs
24‘/2 times last season — a Pan-
ther record — and established
himself as the best sacker the Pitt
program has had since Hugh
Green ran wild in the early
1980s.

He also contributed 137 tack-
les, including a team-high 100 so-
los, and caused six fumbles.

Sounds like a helluva ballplay—
er, this Gadson, a guy who went
from the sideline to the sack-
attack to the studio for an anti-
drug commercial, all in one deep
breath. But, you see, there is only
one problem with all this.

in three sets to Carl Fransson 1-6,
6-4, 5-7.

Vivek Kumar lost in straight sets
to Ken Schweitzer 2-6, 1-6; Paul
Maben had the tables turned in
a 6-0, 0-6, 1-6 loss to John San-
tarelli; and Dan Winicour lost to
Brian Rea 2-6, 2-6.

in doubles, Mills-Maben were
defeated by Sirca-Schweitzer 4-6,
4-6; Meyerowich-Campbell
downed Rea-Santarelli 6-4, 6-3;
and Kumar-Winicour beat

Gadson, listed at 6-foot-1,
210—pounds, played linebacker
for the Panthers. In the NFL, un-
less you're a not-so-everyday Sam
Mills or Mike Singletary type, that
build would qualify you as a
decent-sized defensive back.

Gadson has never ‘played-
defensive back. 

Instant problem. An excellent
football player, a superb athlete,
without a position. And that,
friends, traditionally has ”project
player” written all over it.

But not necessarily so, says Mi-
ami Dolphins director of Player
Personnel Chuck Connor.

”The question on Zeke among
a lot of teams is where to play
him,” Connor told The Pitt News.
”He’d beta productive special
teams player, or you could keep
him at weakside linebacker as a
blitzer. Or put him in on passing
situations as a linebacker where
he could drop back and cover on
put pressure on the splits [ends].

”He’s quick, strong and a solid
hitter, but he's undersized.” Con-
nor added, ”Most teams are
projecting him as a safety. It's
difficult to decide whether to
bring. him right in at safety or play
him on special teams. He needs
work at the safety position.”

Connor made it clear that he is
impressed with Gadson’s capabil-
ities. ”Not a project player,” he
stressed.

Danka-Patterson 7-6, 6-3.
Though the final score was not
pleasing to the Panthers, the

match itself was actually close.__,....

”There were a lot of three set
matches — there were four -
and we lost three of them,” said
Mills.

Meyerowich seemed to cap-
ture the sentiment of the team fol-
lowing the loss.

”We lost 6-3, but any other day '

we could have won 6-3.”

Center fielder Brian Lohman is having a fine season for the Panther baseball team.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April l3, i988

Lohman putting game
together as Panthers
reach midway point

By Christopher Bosak

For The Pitt News

Brian Lohman, a 6—foot senior
center fielder for the Pitt baseball
team, has emerged this year as a
first-rate player and team leader.

Lohman is the captain of the
baseball team for the second
straight season. His batting and
fielding statistics reflect that he
deserves the honor.

Lohman currently has a .397
overall batting average, second
best on the team, and his league
game average is .444, third best
in the conference. His 58 at bats
and 23 hits are good for team top
honors. Lohman scored a run and
was the designated hitter in Pitt's
4-2 victory over Cleveland State
Monday afternoon.

His success has continued in
the field, where he is errorless
through 17 games.

”I’m almost right where I want
to be in both hitting and field-
ing,” Lohman said. ”Both have
gelled really well.”

Lohman feels that he has im-
proved his play over last year,
and that he is much more relaxed

   

this season.

”Last year I put a lot of pressure
on myself,” Lohman said. ”This
year l’m having fun.”

”He’s a good defensive player
and a very good hitter,”said
coach Bobby Lewis. ”He came in
here and started as a freshman.
That's unique.

”Brian has good baseball
sense. It's not as common as one
would think. He's very mature. I
would take a shot at him as a
professional baseball player. He’s
got [a lot of] potential.”

Lohman, however, is not real-
ly surprised with his success this
season.

’’I expected a big season. I got
the confidence going; With each
game you gain confidence,” Loh-
man said. ‘

Lohman said that the team as
a whole is also gaining confi-
dence. He said that Pitt can play
competitively with every team in
the Big East.

”It’s just a matter of getting
some wins under our belt,” said
Lohman.

But wins have been hard for

ball coach, says the opinion of
most of the scouts he's talked
with is that Gadson would be a
strong safety. "He is hard for all
those guys [scouts] to figure out.
Strong safety is where most see
him playing,” said Gottfried.
”They see that he's been very
productive on film. On the film
that we've shown them, one play
that sticks out is that one against
N.C. State [a 34-0 Pitt victory],

I when their back broke for a long

run and Zeke chased him all the
way downfield and caught him
from behind.”

Gottfried was referring to a
60-yard run by Wolfpack tailback
Bobby Crumpler, in which Crum-
pler broke through the Panther
defensive line, outran the entire
secondary and appeared heading
toward the endzone. Gadson
continued pursuit, though, chas-
ing him down the sideline, and

finally dragged Crumpler down at
Pitt's 19-yard line.

"It showed [the scouts] what
kind of heart he has, what kind
of player he is,” Gottfried said.
"Whoever drafts him will be get-
ting a great football player.”

Gadson ‘is aware of the pro’s
analysis of him, and says he is
looking forward to the challenge
of playing safety in the NFL.

"I've never played it before,
but with all the position changes
I've gone through [Gadson was a
running back before he became
a linebacker], I don't think it
would hurt. The position involves
hitting, so I'd like that.

”|’ve been working with Coach
Fox [Pitt's defensive coordinator
and secondary coach]," said
Gadson, "doing backpeddling
drills, working on all the tech-
niques that the position would
involve.” '

And as for his role on special

teams or as a special situations
player?

”I just want to play some-
where," said Gadson. ’’I'm not
expecting to start. I want to con-
tribute.”

Gottfried expects his former
standout to go in the upper
rounds come the April 24 draft.

"It's hard to say what round
he'll go in, but I think he'll go

. relatively high. It wouldn't sur-
prise me if a team that plays the
"46" defense would draft him
since we played a lot of that last
season."

Gadson has expressed a prefer-
ence to where he would like to
play in the NFL. "My fiancee and
I wouldn't mind going out to the
West Coast. We'd like the change
of scenery. It would be somethin
different.” ~

It sure would. For Zeke, almost "

as different as a weakside line-
backer playing safety.

Baseball team fights
off strong Cleveland
St. team for victory

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

Behind the strong pitching of
two freshmen and a four-run sixth
inning, the Pitt baseball team
(4-13) defeated Cleveland State
4-2 Monday at Trees Field.

Cleveland State pitchers held
the Panthers to no hits through
five innings before Pitt second
baseman Chris Cioffi led off the
sixth with a single. First baseman
TJ. O’Leary followed with a sin-
gle, and the inning was started.
When all was said and done, the
Panthers had scored four runs.

In his first start of the season,
Des Schnur got the win by going
seven innings, seven hits, two
walks, striking out six batters and
giving up two earned innings.
Previously, Schnur had only
pitched two innings.

”I was happy to get the chance
to prove myself in a game situa-
tion,” Schnur said. ”But overall,
I was very satisfied with the way
I pitched.”

Chip "Haines pitched the last
two innings to get the save.
Haines struck out two batters and
maintained his ERA of 0.00.

”The team looked really
good,” Haines said. ”We’ve won
three out of our last six, so we're

Lohman  

on a roll.”

This was the first time since the
Villanova game that either pitch-
er had taken the mound.

’’I felt strong and comfortable
out there,” Haines said. ”The lay-
off gave me a chance to strength-
en my arm.”

Schnur, on the other hand, was
a little tired.

’’I felt tired in the later innings.
I need to build up stamina. I'll be
able to do that with more innings
pitched.”

The Panthers only collected six
hits, but they made the most of
them. Mike Claus went two for
four, with one RBI. O’Leary went
two for four, with one RBI and
one run scored. Gregg Lamanti
was one for two, with one RBI
and one run scored. Cioffi went
one for four, with one run scored.
Matt Bianco had two stolen bases
and Claus and Lamanti each had
one steal.

”We played kind of flat even

though we won the game,” assis- ‘

tant coach Joe Risacher said, ”
but I thought Des Schnur pitched
a good game.”

On Thursday, the Panthers trav-
el to Akron, and this weekend,
they travel to Villanova for a four-
game series.

overall.

Lohman attributes the team's
poor start to bad weather and the
absence of two important players.

”It really hurts that [first base-

man] Dave Westwood and
[catcher] Jon Weaver are hurt,"
Lohman said. ”But we're coming
on strong now and want to finish
the season strong.”

remaining, as well as the Big East

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 13, I988

 

Carlisle’s Owens named top big
school player in Pennsylvania

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

Billy Owens made it look so
easy.

Maybe that's why state sports-
writers and sportscasters found it
easy to select Owens as The As-
sociated Press’ 1988 Pennsylva-
nia Big School player of the year.

The 6-foot-9 Owens was a
nearly unanimous choice of the
voters after averaging 35 points
and 14 rebounds a game as
Carlisle High School, 33-0, won
a record fourth consecutive PIAA
Quad—A championship.

But Owens is more than just a
scorer, just a rebounder. He pass-
es like a point guard, blocks shots
like a 7-footer, and his senior sea-
son had college recruiters strug-
gling to recall another

Pennsylvania prep player who
has ever had his combination of
offensive and defensive skills.
”He can play anywhere,” said
Blackhawk High coach John
Miller, who coached Owens in

last Friday's Dapper Dan Round-
ball Classic in Pittsburgh. ”He
can even play point guard. He's
just like Magic Johnson; it doesn't

really matter where you play him-

on the court.”

After leading Carlisle to three
state titles in his first three
scholastic seasons, it was no sur-
prise that Owens was called one
of the nation's two best prep play-
ers by many scouting services.

What did surprise Owens was

I the ease with which Carlisle won

its unprecedented fourth con-
secutive title.

”I thought it would be a lot
tougher,” he said of the Thunder-
ing Herd’s 80-54 title game vic-
tory over Pittsburgh Central
Catholic. ”It was a lot easier than
I ever thought it would be. Our
[title] games the last two years,
against Kiski [Area] and Mead-
ville — they were tough games.
I thought it would be like that.”

But Central Catholic never had
a chance as Owens scored a
tournament-record 53 points, in-

cluding seven intimidating slam
dunks, to nearly outscore the
Knights by himself. Many state
prep historians are already calling
it the most dominating game by
a player in PIAA tournament
history.

”A lot of people have told me
since then [that] it was the
greatest game they've ever seen
in high school, and that made me
feel good,” said Owens, a Syra-
cuse University recruit. ”The
award is great, too, because there
are so many good players in the
state."

Carlisle coach Dave Lebo said
Owens became a great high
school basketabll player because
he was never content to be just
good.

”More than anything else, he is
a winner,” Lebo said. ”With his
talent, he could have been con-
tent to be a big duck in a little
pond, but he's always wanted to
be a big duck in a big pond.
Now, everybody in the state

AP ‘Baseball Writer

Take me out to the
balkgame.

This year, the talk is balk in
the big leagues. They're every-
where — 73 in 73 games so far
—— and the balk-a—thon shows
no sign of slowing down.

”Are you telling me this was
the intent of the thing, turning
this into a farce?” ranted Mil-
waukee Brewers president
Bud Selig, who saw his team
called for an American
League-record five balks
Sunday.

Don't worry, Bud. Your club
has plenty of company. At this
rate, last year's record of 356
balks will be broken next
month.

In the AL, where six balks
were called in the first week
- last season, an absurd 51 have
been committed. In the Na-
tional League, which account-
ed for 217 balks in 1987, there
have been 22 compared to 13
last year.

And more are coming.

”Gentlemen, this is the way
it's going to be,” AL umpire
Larry Barnett said. ”If they
continue ‘to abuse the rule,
we'll continue to see what
happens.”

Barnett’s crew detected six
in the Milwaukee-New York
Yankees game. Umpire Rocky
Roe saw Balk No. 6 and dra-
matically waved his arms,
prompting Brewers manager
Tom Trebelhorn to say: ”If
you're going to call a balk, call
it. But he put on a show, like
he was finishing one of Tchai-
kovsky's biggest numbers.”

Fittingly, Tchaikovsky's
Symphony No. 6 was entitled

‘I1

This season could be
the year of the balk

”Pathetique.”
”It’s bad for the game of
baseball,” Kansas City

managerjohn Wathan said af-
ter a five—balk affair. ’’I don't
like it at all. It could be a
mess.”

It already is. Pitchers are
paranoid, managers are moan-
ing and fans are getting fed up
with ‘ the constant inter-
ruptions.

Umpires, meanwhile, are
doing their jobs. American
League President Bobby
Brown and National‘ League
President Bart Giammati in-
structed their men in blue this
year to make sure pitchers
come to a ”discernible” stop
in their set position and do not
shuffle their feet.

That's been the rule, and
umpires called it that way dur-
ing spring training. Many play-
ers, however, guessed the
crackdown would stop when.
the regular season started.

Guess again.

”|t’s definitely frustrating,”
said Oakland pitcher Bob
Welch, called for three balks
Sunday. ’’It plays with your
mind.” .

Milwaukee's Ted Higuera,
who committed two balks last
season , was also flagged three
times Sunday.

”This year, balks are a big
problem for pitchers,"
Higuera said. ”It’s hard to con-
centrate. I don't understand
it.” ~

Speedsters such as Vince
Coleman, Tim Raines and
Rickey Henderson are also
taking advantage, timing a
pitcher's set position and get-
ting an even bigger jump.

Robinson replaces Ripkin

By Thomas Ginsberg

Associated Press Writer

BALTIMORE —— Frank Robin-
son became baseball's first black
manager in four years on Tuesday
when he was named to replace
Cal Ripken on the Baltimore Ori-

roles in a move made in an at-
tempt to rescue the club from its
worst start in 33 years.

Under Ripken, the Orioles

opened the 1988 season by los— '

ing their ﬁrst six games after
finishing the 1987 season with a
67-95 record, the third-worst
mark in the franchise's history.
Robinson, the first black to
manage at the major league lev-
~el, was also the last black to
manage in the big leagues. He
was fi red by the San Francisco Gi-
ants in 1984.

”I don't profess to be a super-
man. But I do have ideas,” Robin-

_ son said at a hastily called news

conference at Memorial Stadium.

Baltimore General Manager
Roland Hemond said had Robin-
‘son decided not to take the job,
Ripken would have stayed on as
manager. I

him, against CarIisle.”

Carlisle, which had never won
a state playoff game until Owens’
freshman year, was 20-0 in the
post—season during Owens’ four

Robinson, elected to baseball's
Hall of Fame in 1982, was six
games into his first season in a
front-office position as a special
assistant to the president. He has
been a member of the Orioles’
organization as player, coach or
in the front office for 13 years.

Robinson begins his third stint
as a major league manager. His
first assignment was with the
Cleveland Indians from 1974-77
and then was with the Giants
from 1981-84.

”I don't think I ever felt the
pressure of being in the position

-of being a black manager,”

Robinson said. ”I am aware of the
pressure of the position, but I
don't let it bother me.”

Only two other blacks have
managed in the major leagues,
Larry Doby with the Chicago
White Sox in 1978 and Maury
Wills managed Seattle in
1980-81.

Ripken, who has been in the
Orioles’ organization for 32
years, had no forewarning a
move was going to be made.

’’I’m disappointed, no ques-
tion,” Ripken said by telephone.

seasons. The Herd had a 116-11
overall record and was ranked
fifth nationally this season by
USA Today.

”Ever since I was a freshman,

I wanted my senior year to be my

show  not a one-man show, but

”There was no indication that it
was coming. I was in uniform. I
was at my desk getting ready to
write the lineup. Roland called
me to come up to his office and
he told me I was being reliev ."

Earlier in the day, Ripken
pleaded guilty to a drunk driving
charge stemming from a Feb. 3
incident and agreed to continue
treatment for alcohol abuse. Bal-
timore County District Court
Judge Barbara Howe gave Ripken
probation before judgment, fined
him $750 and placed him on
three years of probation.

Ripken had succeeded Earl
Weaver as Orioles manager fol-
lowing the 1986 season, becom-
ing the first man ever to manage
two sons — Cal Ripken Jr. and

‘Billy — simultaneously in major

league baseball history. He had
a 67-101 record as the Orioles
manager over one season plus six
games. -

Hemond said Ripken will stay
on with the Orioles in a front-
office capacity.

Ripken, however, said he had
not made up his mind about tak-
ing the new position.

said. ’’I wanted to be the best I

LOS ANGELES -- Jim Har-

basketball coach who has
been the head coach at Pep-
perdine for the past nine years,
was named the Bruins’ head
coach Tuesday.

Harrick succeeds Walt Haz-
zard, who was fired 13 days
ago. Hazzard was UCLA's
coach for four years. His teams
were 77-47 including 16-14
this past season.

Harrick, 49, was an assistant
coach at UCLA under Gary
Cunningham in the 1977-78
and 1978-79 seasons. After
Cunningham stepped down,
Brown was hired and Harrick
went to Pepperdine, a mem- ‘
ber of the West Coast Athletic
Conference.

Harrick’s teams at Pepper-
dine compiled a 167-97
record. The Waves were
17-13 this past season.

Under Harrick, the Waves

Dear Member of the University Community:

Pitt is once again participating in "Scouting for Food," a
canned food collection drive to help combat local hunger. This
year we hope to engage the entire University community in this
important public service. I'm sure I can count on your generous
 support.

This broad-based campaign covers the six neighboring counties
of the «Allegheny Trail the Boy Scouts of America.
The area, include Washington, Greene,
Westmoreland and ‘

Any canned food in good condition is welcome, but preferred
foods include: peanut butter, chunky-type soups, canned tuna,
 canned stews, canned meat, babyp formula, and any complete
 packaged meal.  

As we all know, hunger is a serious problem. in ‘western
Pennsylvania. "Scouting for Food" is a small but very real way
the Pitt community can do something about it.

Thank you for any support you can give us.
