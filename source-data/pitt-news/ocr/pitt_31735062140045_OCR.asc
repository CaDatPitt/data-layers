Senior Women

Vote For Class
Queen Today

Roses dropped in the laps of
outstanding senior women announc-
ed the nominees for Senior queen
yesterday afternoon at the annual
presentation tea on the twelfth
ﬂoor. ‘

Mary Ruth Hosey, ’-ll, senior
queen last year, spoke to a group
of senior women at the tea, which
was sponsored by the Women’s
Sell“-Government association.

Senior women will vote today
for their queen in the twelfth ﬂoor
conference room from 9:30 to
4:30 o’clock. Senior Court will di-
rect the ballotting.

The Senior queen is expected to
be announced within two weeks at
a Commons room tea, but ﬁnal ar-
rangements have not been complet-
ed and no deﬁnite announcement
has been made.

Pictures of the nominees will be
displayed on the twelfth floor to-
day.

Although no speciﬁc plans for
the announcing of Senior Queen
have been set, it has been deﬁnite-
ly decided not to wait until tap
day to reveal the winner of this
year’s honor. This year will mark
the first time in twenty years that
Senior Queen has not been named
on tap day.

Med Students
Ollered lnactiv,/e
Duty by Army

College students who are bona-
ﬁde accepted inatriculants into the
School of Medicine of the Univer-
sity are eligible for commissions
as second lieutenants in the Medi-
cal Administrative corps of." the
US Anny. C

Captain John P. Cameron as-
sistant professor of science and tac-
tics will interview all interested
students tomorrow in the general
military department office, 435 Ca-
thedral, between 2 and 4 o’clock.

Students commissioned under
the plan will not be subject to call
to active duty during the success-
ful continuance of their medical
course.‘

This plan provides a military de-
ferment for accepted pre-med stu-
dents, and insures a reasonably
steady flow of physicians into the
army.

Upon graduat/ion from medical
school the commissioned students
will be transferred to the medical
corps of the Army of the United
States in the grade of first lieu-
tenant. '

This system is entirely separate
from the regular medical ROTC
course already being conducted in

the School of Medicine.

Phi Mu Fraternity
Robbed Monday

Phi Mu fraternity apartment was
robbed sometime late Monday at-
ternoon. Extent of property taken
and any clues as to the identity of
the burglar were undisclosed.

The robbery was discovered by
Ida Wolfe, 043, who went to the

apartment to decorate it for M011-

day night’:  initiation. ~

Opening tonight for a. three-day
run in the Foster Vmemorial, “The
Women,” a satire on Park avenue
women by Claire Booth, will com-
memorate the twenty-seventh an-
niversary of Pitt Players.

The play begins at 8:15 o’clock.
featuring a cast of 35 women and
one man, Buell Whitehill, director
of the Players, who plays “the
shadow.” _

Organized in 1915 in Thaw hall,
the Players presented their ﬁrst
performance in the spring of 1916.

Jeanine Stephenson, C42, is cast
as Mary, a woman who is “too
nicely smug.” Crystal, the siren, is
played by Jacqueline Fike, . C42.
Sylvia, whose part was made fam-
ous by scieen star Rosalind Rus-
sell, is portrayed by Marian Boggs,
C44. One of the less feline parts,
that of Edith, is acted by Phyllis
Cohen, C44.

Jean Garland, C42, takes the part
of the child Mary. Peggy, another
lady of the circle, is Harriet Wragg,
C44, and Alma Spann, C44, is cast
as Nancy, one of the few single
women in the play. Peggy Martin,
C43, plays Miriam, the chorus girl.

The woman with too many hus-
bands, Countess DeLage, is por-
trayed by Mildred Anderson, C42.
Mary Jeanne Olander, C44, has the
role of Mrs. Morehead, Mary’s
mother.

In supporting roles are: Alice

Poetry Finalists
Compete Today

Finalists in the annual poetry
reading contest will compete this
afternoon at 3:30 o’clock in the
Czechoslovakian room, 113 Cathe-
dral.

Buell Whitehill and Ruth R.
Haun, instructors in speech, and
directors of the ‘contest, judged the
preliminary contestants Monday
afternoon.

Dr. Percival Hunt, professor-at-
large in the English department,
will be the honored guest today
and again will present a copy of
the “()x‘f‘o1-d Book of Verse” to the

student who wins the contest.

Dr. Johnson Enters
Active Duty in ‘ Navy

Dr. J otham Johnson, assistant
professor of classics, has been or-

in the US Navy. He left yesterday

Fhﬁhv ' ‘

Br GEORGE cmmcos
Although Dr. Everett Clin-
chy, noted Presbyterian min-

ister, was unable to speak at.

Pitt Town meeting Monday,
those who attended the meet-
ing were not disappointed.

Dr. James Yard, midwest direct-

or of the national conference of
Christians and Jews and former di-
rector of religion at Northwest-
ern university, speaking on “A Na-
tion of Nations,” the United States,
replaced Dr. Clinchy.

Dr. Yard, primarily ll;l{.il‘L‘:5l9(l in
L What "we are ﬁghting for, said,

“This battle  not a struggle for

 empires, for einpi:-ra-s and colonies

as a govt-rnmenlgal. policy are gone

‘‘ forever. But this l_:;:'i,lfll«3 i:—: a strug-

gle for real fi‘ee<lom anti libority

for every individual in the world." 

“If we are fighting to hold to-
gether the British empire or if we
are ﬁghting to crcatepan American
empire, the inclividual sacrifice is
not worth the goal strived for.”

“If, however, the struggle is for

China's liberation and lndia’s liber- '

ation, and total liberation and
equality of the 13 million negroes
in the United States, then the bat-
tle is justified."

He said that the negro can not
enlist as a seaman in the navy. He
must sign up as a messman or oth-
er such help. In the army he is
segregated into negro regiments
and only recently did the first ne-
gro pilots graduate from Tuskee-
gee.

Dr. Sol Tax, the noted anthrop-
ologist, disproved any erroneous
ideas about the superiority of any
one race.

He said, “Because one race is
technologically ahead of another
race it does not mean that it is
superior culturally. For example.
first the Egyptians were consider-
ed a race superior to the rest
of the world. But along came the
Cretans, then the Greeks, and the

Egyptians were no longer classiﬁed

as superior beings.

“Any race can adopt the cul-
ture and mannerisms of another
race H subject to its onvirmunont

Delta Zctais

Aid Defense
Drive C Today

The women of Delta Zeta,
social fraternity, will have
their day today as they take
over the battleship booth in
the ground ﬂoor lobby to con-
duct the fourth sales voyage
of the little Iowa.

Pennants will stream from the
Iowa’s bow to the adjacent wall
and will urge students and faculty
members to buy defense stamps
and bonds. i

Delta Zeta saleswomen may be
identiﬁed by their anchor-shaped
tags. ' ,_

If official permission can be se-
cured, it is planned to have a vic-
trola in the booth playing Navy
and popular songs. Margaret Wolfe,
C43, and Ruth Becker, Edi!-4, sec-
retary of the battleship drive are
in charge of the decorations and
sales methods. a
g This week’s sales are part of the

large scale plan of the committee
to allow various campus organiza-
tions to assist in the defense stamp
campaign. The ﬁrst poster pub-
licity material on campus will be
used in this week’s drive.

With the trend in stamp and
bond sales continuing upward, an-
other record-brealcing day is ex-
pected by the auditing committee,
who have been kept busier each
Wednesday afternoon calculating
sales totals.

“The busier we are the better
we like it,” is the way Al Glass,
BA42, exp1'e:<sed the conixnitte:::’s
feelings.

School of Ed

Not to Observe
Speed-up Plan

The School of Education is not
undertaking an accelerated pro-
gram this summer because it is
unnecessary and impractical, Dean
Ejnar W. Jacobson explained to-
day. He pointed out that public
schools hire teachers principally
during the sLi1iiinei' months and that
students in a speed-up program
would be graduated during the off-
season.

Instead the usual six-week sum-
mer session, supplemented bytwo
two-week sessions and a six-week
evening session, will be offered.

Students who wish to advance a
full semester will probably be able
to do so by scheduling their re-
quired courses in education during
the six weeks summer session of
the School of Education and by
taking their non-professional cours-
es in the regular college summer
term.

The summer schedule of" the
School of Fducation include.- .-i six’-
week session from June 29 to
August 7, preceded by a two-week
session ’r"rom June 15 to 243, and fol-
lowed by a two-week session from
./\.ugu-it 10 to  The evening ses-
sion will run from June 15 to July
24.

es, assigned to each second round

lations, discussion of the ability of

ter-American action against the
Axis, and the long range aspects
of the entire good neighbor policy,

After dinner is served drawings

Records the past two weeks have
been slow coming in to t'own.lThey
have been released, but shipinents
have not been .t'ortl1coming. Two
good examples of this are the two
new records by Dorsey and Miller.

Tommy's‘ first disc in six weeks
is a super-swing waxing of the
Cole Porter opus “W'hat Is This
Thing Called Love.” Connie Haines
goes all-out on a hot vocal and
Tomm-y’s solo spot is genuine 24-‘
karat stuff.

Flipover has a S-inatraless Vocal
of “Love Sends a Little Gift of
Roses.” Ken Curtis, of Shep Fields’
hand, does the vocal. We’re begin-
ning to miss the flawless Sinatra
already. ’ . « ‘

Miller has just waxed six brand
new sides. They -include “Let's
Have Another Cup of Coffee,”
“Chip Off the Old Block,” “Story
of a. Starry Night,” f‘Skylark,”
“Lamplig‘hter’s Serenade,” and
“Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree.” '
The first two haven’t been receiv-
ed in town. as yet.

Yours truly had a very interest~
ing thirty minute talk with Bob
Chester, the band leader, at the
Chatterbox last Friday nite. Con-
versation naturally turned to recl-
ords. Bob was very enthused about
his latest record “Sunburst” which
will be released March‘ 20th.

It’s his theme song and promises

“Just like a Joseph Conrad ad-
venture,” is the way Arthur Na-
gel’s mother describes the letters
she has received from her son, '1
'41 University graduate stationed
at Fort Randolph in the Canal
Zone, Panama.

Nagel is now with a small Anti-
’Air-craft division in the heart of
2, Panama jungle.

His escape from death has been
reported in numerous papers
throughout the country. While
transferring a search-light from
Fort Randolph into the juhgle the
truck slipped out of gear, and two
of the four officers jumped. Arthur
and the driver remained in the
speeding army truck and, being
unable to fix it, managed to drive
into a hill just in time to avoid a
650 foot drop.

When they were sent into the
jungle the soldiers had to build
their own barracks and put a co-
ment floor in it. They also laid a
pipe line which enable:-. them to
get fresh water ;l'rom Fort Ran-
giolph.

Although they are now reason-
ably settled there are still numer-
ous unploasantries to deal with.
They must take quinine every day
to guard against malaria. and pro-
tect themsolve.-1 against the snake.-

To honor fall and winter Pitt
athletic teams, the Physical ‘Edu-
cation club is sponsoring the Sport
Swing, Friday night in the Cathe-
dral gymnasium.

Paul Scott’: collegiate orchestra
will provide the music for the
dance, which is scheduled from

8:30 to 12 o'clock. The dance is

open to the general student body

and costs $1.10 a couple. '

Just before this event, the Pitt
Players will present the last per-
formance of their present produc-
tion, “The Women.” Physical Edu-
cation club members point out that
students will have time to see “The
Women” and attend the dance.

To keep the dance in the sport
theme, coaches of all the Univer-
sity sports and their wives will act
as chaperons.

but Fort Randolph soon remedied

in spite of these hardships he is
enjoying the experience and does
not regret his three year enlist-

Higlw Sclibols Will
Discuss Future

World Order

“Post-War Organization” is the
topic selected for nation-wide high
school debating for the school year
1942-43 by the National Univer-
sity Extension association’s com-
mittee on debate materials and in-
terstate cooperation. The announce-
ment was made by the chairman,
C. Stanton Belfour, assistant di-
rector of the University's Exten-
sion Division and executive secre-
tary of the Pennsylvania Forensic
and Music league.

The NUEA conducts the debate
selection procedure each year, is-
sues handbooks and materials re-
lating to the questions, broadcasts
a radio network debate, and or-
ganizes a debate conference.
Topics are nominated by the de-
bate leagues in several states and
submitted to a committee. The four
topics presented this year were:
Post-War Organization, Permanent
Price Control Policy, Government’s
Relation to Labor Problems, and
Means of Meeting Post-War Eco-
nomic Situation.
This year, American high
schools are debating military edu-
cation for youth before draft age.

Another point he brought
was that the words “aryan“ and
“semitic” have nothing to do with
races but are linguistic terms.

Both agreed that prejudices
against any color, race, or cieed,
will die out after the war with the
rise of a new educated class which
will consider the individual and
not where he came from or what
stock he sprang from.
