Pitt to form ad hoc committee for tmnsgende?’ Policies

By Em Maier
Staﬁ"Write.r

The University Senate has plans

to form an ad hoc committee as
early as next week to look into.

and create policies regarding
transgender people at Pitt.
Michael P-insky, president of
the University Senate, met with
Pitt’s Anti-Discriminatory -.Poli-
cies Committee (ADPC) multi-
ple times over the course of the
spring semester about gender-
discriminatory issues. He then
decided to create an ad hoc com-
mittee, based on a report gener-
ated from the ADPC’s research

into transgender facility use.
“The ADPC identiﬁed a sig-
niﬁcant issue involving students,
faculty and staff at the University
of Pittsburgh. Speciﬁcally, how
we are going to handle the per-
sonal side of transgender stu-
dents and staff regarding bath-
room facilities, locker rooms
and housing,” Pinsky said. '
The ADPC does not make
policy, but instead advises the
University Senate — which
serves to keep communication
open between students, faculty
and administration — on topics
relating to discrimination and

inequality.

Last month, that committee

unanimously passed a .resolu-

tion recommending that the,

University allow students to use
gendered bathroom facilities ac-
cording to personal gender iden-
tity rather than natal sex. _

' But the University opposed
the recommendation when‘ it
declared that Pitt’s transgender
students would be required to
use only the bathroom facilities
that correspond to the sexes list-
ed on their birth certiﬁcates.

The ADPC will still deal with
implementing the school’s non-

discrimination policy, but trans- ,
gender issues will no longer be ‘

its primary focus.
Pinsky said that Pitt formed

the new ‘ad hoc group to look
into transgender issues for sev-
eral reasons.

He said that although the
ADPC had gathered and ana-
lyzed data about transgender
housing, bathroom and locker
room use, the information col-
lected was too bro_ad to address
these speciﬁc issues.

In addition, Pinsky said, the
ADPC itself was polarized.

“There was signiﬁcant in-
ternal dissent within members
of the committee as to the ﬁnal
product,” Pinsky said.

Pinsky plans to task the new
committee with three goals: ex-
amining the state’s transgender

policies, examining the pres-
ent policies at other reputable
institutions in the a state and
surrounding regions and incor-
porating the recommendations
and advice of societies that have
previously addressed transgen-
der issues.

“The goal is to speciﬁcally re-
view what’s out there in the com-
munity and make ... a reasonable
set of recommendations,” ‘Pin-
sky said.

The committee will create a
set of policies “which takes into
consideration the needs and
safety of the transgender popu-

hopes to have the roster ﬁnalized by next

“I want neutral and intelligent people
who are willing to objectively look at the
issue to allow transgender individuals to

ADPC president Jane Feuer forwarded

questions about the new committee to‘

Irene Frieze, a psychology and women’s
studies professor at Pitt. ’ '

Frieze and Anthony Infanti, a law pro— 4

fessor and an associate dean for Academic

nascent committee. A
But the constant bomb threats around

ress, Pinsky and Frieze said. '

now, it appears thatwe have temporarily
tabled ﬁnalizing the committee,” Frieze
said. A
Pinsky and the University Senate elect-
ed to hold off on the committee’s meeting
and development until Monday in order
to -stabilize the University before acting.
At the meeting, Pinsky will announce the

_ full roster and charge the appointees with

their duties. _

Emilia Lombardi, an assistant profes-
sor at Pitt’s Departmentof Infectious Dis-
eases and Microbiology and a transgen-
der woman, said she was pleased with the
creation of the group.

“While the idea of having a group to
speciﬁcally .focus on transgender issues is
nice, I wish it could have arose from a bet-
terset of circumstances,” said Lombardi,
who is leavingthe University this summer
for reasons unrelated to the schodl’s pol-
icy regarding facility usage. “There have
been many issues regarding trans inclu-
sion that have been coming to the ADPC
over the years. Having a speciﬁc group
to address a broad range of issues I feel
would be useful in the long run.” «

Pinsky expressed hope and certainty
of a swift resolution to the related issues
— housing, bathroom and locker-room
use _— and he said he is conﬁdent in the
new committee’s ability to devise appro-
priate policy recommendations.

“I fully think that we can resolve this
very quickly to the satisfaction of the

transgender students and the rest of the‘

community,” Pinsky said.

Don’tdeny spring break funding

Student organizations plan-
ning trips‘for next year’s spring
break, take note. It could soon
become ofﬁcial Student Gov-

‘ ernrnent Board policy‘that no

student, organizations be al-
lowed to receive funding for
trips taken over spring break.
A planned amendment to
the SGB Allocations Manual
will codify a Board precedent
for not providing funding to
student organizations for trips
that will occur during spring
break, unless the trips areifor
events that are considered
mandatory for club members
to attend. As The Pitt News re-
ported in February, the as—of-
yet unwritten policy exists to
prevent both misuse of funding

. and competition between club

trips and the Student Activities
Fee-funded Pitt Alternative
Break program, which sends
groups of students to do com-
munity service projects in dis-
advantaged areas in multiple
states. ‘ .

We believe that this policy
will unfairly affect a large num-
ber of students whose organi-
zations might plan to attend

‘ events during ' spring break.
The week off in March provides -

a convenient time for organiza-
tions to plan trips because the
vacation makes it easier for
students to leave campus with-
out missing classes. Accord-
ing to SGB President James

-Landreneau, funding will still

be available for trips that are
deemed mandatory. For exam-
ple, funding.can be allocated
for an organization’s trip if the
group will lose its status for not
attending a national confer-
ence. However, it seems to us

'— that denial of funding toa trip

just because it is not manda-
toryt for an organization’s exis-
tence also constitutes a short-

’ sighted policy; optional. trips
can certainly prove just as en-
-riching and serve as legitimate

uses of funding. -
Another issue is the sheer
number of students that this

» policy could affect. As~The_ Pitt

News reported in February, only
80 students can participate in
the University-sponsored ‘Al-

ternative Break program. Ac-

cording to the University Fact_

Book, “there are about 18,000

undergraduate students at Pitt

.who pay the Student Activities
Fee, an $80 fee that all non-
College of General Studies un-
dergraduates pay each ‘semes-
-ter to fund the activities’ and

‘ events of student organiza-

tions. If a student group’s trip
does not receive funding for a
trip during spring break, it is
most likely that- the burden of
paying for it will fall toithe club
and its members. Although Al-
‘ternative Break is no doubt-_-a
meaningful program, students
who have been anticipating a
trip to, say, a clublsports tour-
nament will likely not abandon
their club activity to compete
for one of a relatively few spots
on Alternative Break.
According to Landreneau,
Board members are concerned
that groups could use funding
as an excuse to take an extend-
ed vacation. However, the SGB

Allocations process theoreti- .
cally already has accountabil- .

ity built in. For example, the
Board requires groups to sub-

mit receipts for all purchases ~
funded through -Allocations. It »

follows then that SGB’ should
be able to individually evalu-
ate the value of each student
organization’s proposed trip
_instead of conﬁning itself by
formalizing a precedent -that

assumes any student organiza— .

tion that travels during spring

break is using funding as an ex-

cuse for a vacation. ,
When this policy is voted on

next week, it will be to decide '

whether or not this precedent

_ should be codiﬁed. However,

we view it as in the best inter-

est Pitt students that this policy

not be made official and should

instead be discarded in favor

of a policy that treats equally

all student activities’ requests
for funding. SGB should pro-

vide monetary support for any
program that constitutes a le-
gitimate use of the Student Ac-
tivities Fund — regardless of
whether or not it occurs during
spring break. I

decisions. in iTmyvon Martin case ,

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

 

We all know the story by now. On,Feb. 26, George ;

Zimmerman, a 28-year-old white Hispanic man,
pursued Trayvon Martin, an unarmed, black
17-year-old, through the streets of their gated
community in Sanford, Fla., and fatally shot him.
When police arrived in response to a telephone
call from a neighbor who said she’d heard the boy
screaming for help, Zimmerman claimed that he

killed Martin in self-defense. Despite the fact that '

they had explicitly told him not to pursue Martin
during an earlier phone call, the Sanford police
apparently tooklZimmerman’s word for it and did
not arrest him. , a

. After more than a month of constant media
coverage and widespread protest, Zimmerman
was charged with second—degree murder on April
11, nearly six weeks after the incident. _

This case, one of the most controversial in
years, has an interesting parallel in the case of
John McNeil, another man who, in 2005, used his
state’s “Stand Your Ground” law as a defense after
fatally shooting a man he claimed was threatening
him.

Unlike Zimmerman, McNeil was on his own
property when he shot Brian Epp, a man his fam-
ily had previously hired asla construction worker,‘
who was trespassing at 1_VIcNeil’s house after be-
ing repeatedly asked to leave. Unlike Zimmerman,
McNeil shot an adult who was armed — albeit

with a knife against McNeil’s gun. Unlike Zimmer-
man, McNeil had a son on the premises and every
reason to believe.tqhat-son was in danger. Unlike
Zimmerman, McNeil had witnesses corroborating
his account of how the shooting occurred.

Unlike Zimmerman, McNeil was b1ac1<,,and the
man he shot was white. Mc_Neil is serving life in
prison. . .. -5

Now,'does it still seem ludicrous that some of
us think the Trayvon Martin shooting — and its
handling by local police — was about race?

' I am not a juror in this case. It is not for me to
say whether Zimmerman is guilty or not guilty of
second-degree murder. I will say, however, that I
— like many Americans — was deeply upset when
it appeared he.would not have to stand trial, and
that I, like many Americans, am_ relieved that he
is going to. Although it has yet to'be established
whether there is enough evidence to convict Zim-
merman of second-degree murder, it’s difﬁcult to
dispute that the police had every reason at least to
charge him._He.called them to report a ‘suspicious
person.’ They told himnot to pursue, and he did.’
Less than an hour later he was standing next to the
dead body_ of an unarmed teenager. That might not
be evidence enough for a conviction, but it is cer-
-tainly evidence enough for an arrest. .

“So why, before the public outcry, was Zimmer-
man allowed to walk away from the scene without-
a summons? Under the “Stand Your Ground Law”
in Florida, one is immune from prosecution for
use of lethal force under such circumstances as

In about a week and a half, I’ll
be sitting in Alumni Hall for the
English department graduation
ceremony. Afterward, I’ll go to

lunch with my mother and my-

grandmother, where I’ll'undoubt-
edly cry and drink two, maybe
three, cosmos. My mind will race,
more than usual, about life, goals
and time — all the big °questions.
Mostly, however, I’ll think about
where I was just one week prior
—~ classrooms, my apartment full
of amazing ladies and the studio
theatre stage.

“How,” I’ll think, “is it pos-
sible that I’ve left the place where
I had grown for four years from a
teen to an adult?”

The end to“ anything is sad,
even if it was a relationship you
wanted to move on from or your
last day in a branch office before
transitioning to the main head-
quarters. You’re saying goodbye
to a part of your life, and you’re
also anticipating the future, curi-

_ ous and hopeful about the person

you’ll become. ‘
An ending is an opening — a
messy rip. In writing, I can con-

trol my endings, allowing them"

to unfurl into a satisfying expe-
rience for the reader. Away from
the keyboard, however, I’m not
‘so suave. In fact, I have a particu-
larly strong aversion to endings.
During move-out weekend every
year, I’d hide away in the Star-
bucks on Craig Street or, as alo-
cal, head home until Sunday eve-
ning when I could quietly move
out — always, at my insistence,
by myself.

your interests.

plans for the upcoming year —
apart from submitting graduate
school applications —- I realize I
need to start mentally preparing
for one of the biggest endings "of
my life so far. When I brought up
this topic with my roommates,
they didn’t want to talk about it
— which made me realize it was
the perfect subject for my last Pitt
News column. It’s something ev-
ery Class of 2012 student is going
through. .-

My take on ending undergrad-
uate studies is that we should

, treat it the way an author treats

the last chapter of a novel — as
an exciting opportunity. It’s e_x—
citing because we can choose the
path for the next phase of our

lives and create our own personal '

narrative.
So far, our lives have been
structured. At high school gradu-

ation, we were all moving on g

where we’d still have RAs watch-
ing over us, homeworkto do and
a clear goal — to graduate! But
after college, the consequences
of our actions will be our own re-
sponsibility. It’s scary, yet excit-

- ing; we have more control over

Think back to the person you
were at freshman orientation and
about who you are today. You’ve
discovered a ‘lot about yourself,

your strengths and your inter— _

ests. Use what you’ve learned to
forge ahead and make realistic
goals. Remember that graduating
doesn’t mean you’re expected to
know everything about the world
or even what your next steps will
be. As a Pathﬁnder, I get the “So
what’s next for you?” question
about ﬁve times a week. People
expect you to be prepared to an-
swer. But that doesn’t mean that
you have to know right away.
Your future life is now like the
next book in an epic series, and
the most dramatic adventures
are yet to come.

Think back to how you sur-
vived ‘ your freshman year. Go
back further to remember your
ﬁrst day at the big and scary high
school —— or even further, to the

iﬁrst _day of ﬁrst grade. We’ve
made it to adulthood. We’ve be— '

dent people — just like when we
spent our ﬁrst week sans parents,
having to feed ourselves and do
our laundry or when we drove
our beat—up purple Chrysler into

the massive -high school parking ;
lot or when we let go of mom’s ’

hand and stepped onto a big yel-
low school bus for the ﬁrst time.

.With each chapter, the stakes

are raised, but the successes-are
more" rewarding. The university
experience has made us well-
groomed adults, and my wish for

when one “reasonably believes

- it is necessary to do so to pre-

vent death or great bodily harm
to himself or another or to pre-

vent the commission of a forc— ‘

ible felony.”

To say that Zimmerman is ex- '

empt under this law is to say that
it is reasonable to believe that an
unarmed black teenager walking

.through a mostly white neigh- .

borhood must be about to com-
mit a forcible felony. It’s saying
that it’s reasonable to pursue said
juvenile with a gun and, when a
physical confrontation does or
does not ensue '—— depending
on whose witnesses. you choose

to believe on that point — to ’

shoot him fatally. To allow Zim-
merman to go free based on the

“Stand -Your Ground Law” is to .
A publicly state that a 17-year-old

black male, by his very nature,
may reasonably be considered

' a threat so greatas.to justify the

use of lethal force. V

“Stand Your Ground” is
meant to allow a person to _de-
fend himself in places other
than his own home; it is not a
declaration of open season on
anyone that any armed person
ﬁnds suspicious-looking. It’s all
well and good to presume Zim-

.~ merman innocent until proven
guilty in court. But by failing

even_to arrest him at the scene

of the crime, the Sanford police ‘

went well beyond presuming

Zimmerman innocent; they ac- ,

tually presumed Trayvon Mar-
tin guilty. ‘

And that’s the crux of the
problem. When black kids turn
up dead orseriously injured by
white. people, the bar for “rea-

sonable belief” that the vio—_

lence was necessary tends to be
set much lower than in cases

— such as John McNeil’s — that
don’t involve a black victim and
a white perpetrator. _

Those of us who were angry
when it appeared that Zimmer-
man would never be charged
were not angry because we
wanted Zimmerman thrown in
prison without a trial. We were

angry because this case, like so

many more, demonstrates all
too clearly.how criminal law is
applied unequally in the United
States, and how'it’s applied in
a way that speciﬁcally deval-
ues the lives of people of color
and grants disproportionate,
unearned beneﬁt of the doubt
to white people who take those
lives. -

We are angry because so
many Americans seem so eager
to overlook this obvious_fact.
We’re angry because news out-
lets as reputable as ABC News
and The New York Times have
reported, erroneously, that
Zimmerman was acting in his

Five worthwhile documentaries intrigue viewers

By Pat McAteer
Staff Writer

This second installment of a
two-part series consists of the last
ﬁve ﬁlms on a list of worthwhile
documentaries thatwill intrigue
viewers on a variety of subjects.
Unlike many other documentaries,
these picks will not ‘leave viewers
disappointed.
The list continues last week’s
“Avoid bad documentaries, take

this advice and be entertained.”

5. “No Direction Home:
Bob Dylan”

Bob Dylan is not an artist who
sold out for the approval of his
fans.

In “No Direction Home,” direc-
tor Martin Scorsese examines how
fans perceived this to be the case
between 1961 and 1966, the forma-
tive years of Dylan’s career. Scors-
ese shows Dylan’s journey from
the small town of Hibbing, Minn.,

'1‘ 2-’

to Greenwich Village in New York
City, the thriving scene of 1960s
folk music.

Aided by footage of some of Dy-
lan’s most rousing musical perfor-
mances, the ﬁlm journeys not only

through Dylan’s career, but also

through the evolution of popular
music. The audience witnesses
an entertaining recap of Dylan’s
life with revealing musical clips

that document this famed artist’s_

career.

. i ".2-as

apprrmclics the events. oft),/11. tlirotxgh llur iryws nl':n'1is1_ic locals.

 

4. “For The Bible Tells Me So”

The most culturally-relevant
ﬁlm ‘on the list, “For the Bible
Tells Me So” examines the on-
going struggle between the gay
rights movement and organized
religion. The ﬁlm follows several
homosexual people with conserva-
tive religious families who face the
challenge of revealing their secrets
to their parents.

The documentary depicts the
reactions of and subsequent accep-
tance from the families. While the
movie’s plot presents a captivating
storyline all around, the path to-
ward acceptance might be itsmost
enthralling element. Without even
vocalizing the issue, it’s clear that
the parents face a difficult conﬂict
between blood and. their faith.
“For the Bible Tells Me So” has a
relatable quality that viewers can

appreciate, regardless of their

beliefs.

3. “Freakonomics”
“Freakonomics,” an adapta-
tion of the 2005 nonﬁction book

' of the same name, succeeds in

doing what few professors have
done: make economics interest-
ing and understandable for non-
economics majors.

The ﬁlm examines four differ-
ent concepts and presents them in
a straightforward manner. Begin-
ning with the segment “It’s Not Al-

ways a Wonderful Life,” University '

of Chicago economist Steven Lev-
itt depicts the argument that the
drop in the crime rate in the 19905
can be attributed to the decision
made in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abor-
tion. Levitt argues thatby reducing
the number of unwanted pregnan-
cies, abortion unintentionally kept
criminals off the street.
“Freakonomics” includes more

than just that and relates interest- '

ingly to society. In essence, the ﬁlm
takes economics to a personal and
familiar level, making for a user-
friendly documentary.‘ ‘

2. “7 Days in September”
Most Pitt students have a

 

memory of the morning of Sept.
11, 2001. But few can claim to
have experienced it as vividly as
the seven videographers from “7
Days in September.”

The ﬁlm features footage from
the perspective of seven different
amateur ﬁlmmakers who lived in
New York City at the time of the
destruction of the World Trade
Center and the days following.
Most of the content featured in the
documentary is absolutely chilling:
close-up footage of the plane hit-
ting Tower 2, workers jumping out
the windows of burning buildings
and the smoke that encompassed
New York City after the collapse of
the World Trade Center.

“7 Days in September” is avisual
reminder of 9/11 and demonstrates
the intense locality of the event.

1. “After Innocence”

Unlike the popular ﬁction ﬁlm
“The Shawshank Redemption,” the
documentary “After Innocence”
follows the true stories of seven
former prisoners who were re-
leased from their holding once
DNA evidence was considered in
their cases.

While the ﬁlm shows their hap-

py release, the former prisoners‘
- then ﬁnd themselves mired in a

situation in which they possess no
marketable skills and little support
from the state or federal govern-
ment._Along with the exonerated
individuals, the ﬁlm also docu-
ments the work of various groups
that assist these men, including
the Innocence Project, a group of
pro bono lawyers who represent
wrongfully convicted individuals
in trial. The group claimed that it
had received more than 100,000
letters from imprisoned individu-
als.

_ If nothing "else, the documen-
tary provides a compelling argu-
ment for the ending of capital
punishment in the United States
and emotionally compelling bi-
ographies of seven men who faced
unjust punishment.

WPTS Contributor ,

I’ve heard that the sense of smell best
conveys memory. But for me, I think that
the sense of hearing has a unique ability to
access memory more completely.”

Smells often shock me with strong but
disjointed memories. I have trouble placing
them, which is ultimately unsatisfying.
When I encounter the scent of artiﬁcial
strawberry, it requires a few aggravating
minutes before I’m able to recall the
Strawberry Shortcake doll I had as a child.
Similarly, the varied smells of soft plastics
can be hard to identify —— is it the smell
of my Pokémon card carrier, my ﬁshing
tackle box or the Pinch A Penny pool store
I visited as a child? ‘

Where the olfactory fails, sound
succeeds in offering complete and precise
forms of nostalgia. As a poet, amateur
musician and college radio D}, I am very
interested in the capability of sound to
transmit sentiment. A certain strum, a
syllable, the call of a certain bullfrog —
these sounds can wrap -me in a tangible
experience, and offer a sort of oasis of the
past.

apartment. My music library played for

Last night VAI was studying in my»

a few hours before Yo La Tengo’s album I
Can Hear the Heart Beating as One came
through my speakers.

And then something strange happened:
I felt instantly transported to my high
school bedroom. The sensation of that
long—gone space was thick inside my
present—day apartment. I could sense a
window open on a differentspring, wafting
smells of central—Pennsylvanian mud
freshly overturned by worms, and baseball
gloves stretching in the night.

It was all so tangible. I could sense the
silence of a small mountain town sitting
just outside my window, but I remained in

Pittsburgh. I even felt my high school self _

relaxing my tense shoulders, somehow
soothing the anxiety caused by upcoming
college ﬁnals.

A sound brought me this experience.

I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is
an album that I haven’t spent quality time
with since the spring of my freshman year
in high school. Somehow, these songs have
infused themselves with the present.

This was not a unique experience. I
often feel emotional over sound that has
become entangled with a speciﬁc time and
place. The sound of a New York accent hits
me with a nice dose of homesickness. The
sound of a dial—up connection brings me
back to my days waiting for a punk—‘rock

chat room to load. The sound of a bassoon
playing reminds me of my brother who

* lives in Arizona.

In my freshman year of college, I carried
a tape recorder to collect a sound diary. I
recorded the jams my friends and I made
on the organ we hauled into my dorm suite.
I recorded loud party conversations in a
sweaty stairwell and even the sounds made
while I greased my bike chain. This sound
journal has been much more successful
than any written diary I have ever kept.

Dutch Djmidback Luke talks
music and influences  

By Andrew Gretchko
_ Staﬁ" Writer

Dutch D] Laidback Luke began making
electronic music in 1992. He’s since
evolved as an artist and now labels his
music “SweDutch,” a category that denotes
the combination of Swedish and Dutch
electronic music. He credits his parents,
both of whom were musicians, as having
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced his style.

As part of his “Speak Up” tour, DJ
Laidback Luke will be performing in
Pittsburgh this Saturday at Stage AE.

He talked with The Pitt News about
his family, electronic dance music and
personal sound.

The Pitt News: You started with
grafﬁti. How did you make the transition
to music?

D] Laidback Luke: My ﬁrst talent in
life was drawing. I started drawing since
I was 4 years old, and that transitioned
into graffiti. I got caught when I was [16
years old and decided to focus more on my
music. I actually see music as images; I see
my songs as my graffiti nowadays.

TPN: Your parents have a musical
background. Did they have any influence
on your music‘? V

LBL: Absolutely! My mom was always a
singer and performer, and my dad was the
one-man band behind my mom. He would
always bring a drum machine and play the
guitar. I’ve seen them both perform since

I was in kindergarten. It deﬁnitely helped
me to be musically active and not be shy
on stage.

TPN: What instruments do you play?

LBL: I come from a musical family and
everyone can play an instrument, but I
was that kid that wasn’t able to play the
instrument as well as the other family

a members, so that always kind of frustrated

me. This is why I started to get into
electronic music. Because when I found
out .1 could actually make music with the
help of a computer, I could ﬁnally unleash
what has always been stuck in my mind.

TPN: Electronic music can be broken
down into so many subgenres. How would

you describe your sound, as well as the

electronic music genre itself?

LBL: When I ﬁrst got into this type of
music in ’92, everythingwas called “house.”
It could be soulful, harder, techno or more
acid, but it was always called house. And
with that type of mind—frame I’m still in

, this kind of music, which is why my sets

are always that variable and I tendto mix
up various styles of electronic dance music.
To me it’s all the same. It’s just electronic
dance music. To sum up my style, I
would say it’s SweDutch. My production
capabilities come from Swedish House
Maﬁa, who are very much in the studio
and about producing techniques. But,,of
course, I’m Dutch, and one of the founders
of that typically Dutch sound. So my sets

‘Lockout’ only good for or laugh

By Larissa Gula
Staﬂ"Writer

Silly and predictable action
ﬁlms can still be entertaining, as
long as the viewer is in the right
mindset. w W

The French sci—ﬁ action
movie “Lockout” is one such .
ﬁlm, featuring a simultaneously
quick and_ lazy plot set in 2079,
in which a man who goes by
the name “Snow” (Guy Pearce)
is arrested and framed for a
crime he did not commit. He’s
convicted and set to be shipped
off to the orbiting space prison
MS One. Since prisoners sent to
MS One serve their sentences in
a frozen state, the correctional
facility is known for having a
perfect prison record.

Butbefore Snow can be sentto
the maximum—securi_ty prison, a
prisoner manages to escape. The
other convicts inside are then
set looseand overrun the prison.
Two inmates, Alex (Vincent
Regan) and the psychotic Hydell
(Joseph Gilgun), quickly take
command.

Since the prison break took

By cinematic standards,
“Lockout” does not qualify as
a good ﬁlm.’ It’s predictable
straightforward, and

incredulity an audience member
will experience during this ﬁlm
is absurd. “Lockout” does not
make much sense.

But for some viewers, the
actors and writing might make
up for the lack of originality

in the story and plotlines. The
cliches might even make this
ﬁlm entertaining.

Snow comes across as a witty
badass, never panicking and
almost always keeping his cool.
He cracks jokes at just the right

moments throughout the movie. ..

The indifferent action hero is
nothing new, but that doesn’t
mean Pearce’s portrayal of the
trope isn’t enjoyable. From the
start of the ﬁlm, Snow showcases
his personality. During an
interrogation scene, he answers
every question with a wisecrack,
receives a punch in the head and
then repeats the process ﬁve
or six times. But every remark
makes the audience smile.
Emilie is not an entirely

useless damsel in distress. She "

acts bravely in her attempt to
watch over the other people
trapped in the overrun prison,
despite Snow’s orders to rescue
her and take her back to her
father.

M This does not mean the
characters have a strong
relationship. In fact, it’s quite

are most of the time switching back and
forth to the Swedish‘ big-room sound and
the bleepy Dutch sound.

TPN: What’s the difference between the

I Swedish and Dutch sounds?

I LBL: The Dutch sound is the bleepy kind
of style you hear nowadays in commercial
hip-hop. .It’s always very ble‘epy—orientate_d
and layered types of beats. The Swedish
sound is very much Swedish House Maﬁa,
who actually invented ,big-room house
music. ' I’ '

festivals all over the world. What do you

think about electronic music dominating_

these festivals and the rise of festivals in
the U.S.? . A . — .
LBL: -I think it’s amazing! -I’ve been
touring the U.S. since 2000, ‘and I
remember the U.S.‘ being a country focused

on hip—hop and rock, so when I started to "
' play here for the ﬁrst_ time, people would

ask me to play hip—hop or rock while I was
only playing rave music. To see the rise of
electronic dance music in the U.S. right
n_ow is a dream come true. This actually
happened in Europe 10 years ago, and

I'always wondered why the U.S. stayed‘

behind. But now “it’s here, and it- seems to

outlandish plot elements. '

— nothing more, but nothing less.

FOOTBALL

  Paul Ch

By Lauren Kirschman
’ . Sports Editor

Paul Chryst is changing the cul-
ture of Pitt football. At least that’s
what redshirt junior Cameron
Saddler says.

Pitt hired the former Wis-
consin offensive coordinator in

December, making Chryst Pitt’s a
fourth head coach in just more

than a year. For a program faced
with so much instability, some
change of culture might be exact-
ly what the Panthers need.

After six.-year head coach Dave
Wannstedt resigned under pres-
sure following the 2010 Season,
Pitt hired Miami of Ohio head
coach Michael Haywood, but he
was ﬁred from the position two
weeks later after being arrested
in South Bend, Ind., on charges

of domestic battery against the ,
mother of his child. .

Next, Pitt hired Todd Graham,

a fast-talking and enthusiastic‘

Texas native who brought prom-
ises of “high octane” and doing
things “the Pitt way” when he
cruised into Pittsburgh to take
over the program.

But one 6-6 regular ‘season
and a text message to_ his play-
ers later, Graham left to take the
same position at Arizona State.

The Panthers found them-
selves without a coach for the
third time in a year, but freshman
running back‘ Isaac‘ Bennett said‘
the team didn’t have a difficult
time trusting Chryst or his staff
when they took over the pro-
gram. V — '

“Coach Chryst is a really genu-
ine guy,” Bennett said. “You can
see it in how he talks and how he
approaches us. I trust what he
says.” ’

Bennett said some of that_will—
ingness to trust the new coach
stems from former running back
Zach Brown ——' who introduced

‘Chryst to the team — vouch-‘
‘ ing for the coach’s character last
year. Brown played three seasons i

at -Wisconsin before ‘ transferring

to Pitt for his ﬁnal year of eligibil— 4

ity last season. :
“Zach: Brown  told usabout
himiand said we could trust him,”

Bennett said." “Sothings [Chryst] ‘

    

  SPORTS

   

 

says, you don’t even think twice .
about it because we already have
that trust.” ‘ .
Chryst said that when it comes
to developing a relationship with
players, “actions always speak
louder than words.” ‘
“You just do it by being who
you are and being straightfor-
ward,” Chryst said. “Just trying to
be consistent with who you are.”
Away from the ﬁeld, Chryst is .
soft-spoken and easygoing. ‘But

‘much like the city he now inhab-

its, he is completely focused on
the game itself. When it’s time for
practice, he’s all business.
Saddler said that Chryst’s
main instructions for the team
are simple: Do what you need to.

_do, be where you need to be, and

then the rest will come.

' “Coach Chryst is the man,”
Saddler said. “He’s so laid back,
but at the same time you saw him
jump all over me when I celebrated

[making a play]. You won’tsee that A

out of me anymore at this camp.”
A While Saddler said his new

head coach has helped the team

members relax, he added that

_ Chryst is intent on “getting busi- _

ness done” whenitcomes time to
play football. -
“It’s about doing your job. And

that’s the main thing, holding -

l’.‘ml t‘|11'_\'.~.l .‘~.[')r‘{Il\.‘-.

  

each other accountable,” Saddler
said. .

Bennett agreed.

“He’s down to business, play
when it’s time to play,’-’ Bennett
said. “He gets focused quick.”

Chryst attributes much of his
coaching philosophy —— which
centers around respect for the

game and teaching —— to what he -

learned from his father, the late
George Chryst, who coached at
the University of Wisconsin-Plat-
teville for more than 30 years.
“My philosophy is that coach;

’ es are teachers and you need to

be teaching the game of football
and respect the game,” Chryst
said. “You need to be able to make
players the best players they can
be. It’s a ’player’s game, and the
coach’s job is to prepare them so
they can play to the best of their
ability.” _ ’
George Chryst didn’t just in-
spire his son’s future perspec-
tive on coaching. He also ignited
Chryst’s desire to enter the pro-

fession, although Chryst added '

that his father never pushed him
in that direction.

“I grew up with it,” Chryst.

said. “I was exposed to it at an
early age, so I thought I’d give it
a shot. I was fortunate enough to
have good experiences along the

aingearly ipressio

Co1n'tt-sy Pin ./\[|'ll(.‘l'i(.‘.'s'
earlier this st-::.~.<n'l.

way so that I wanted to stay in it
and keep growing.”

A Madison, Wisc., native,
Chryst started at quarterback for
the University of Wisconsin be-
fore beginning his coaching ca-
reer at West Virginia as a gradu-
ate assistant in 1989.

Since then, he’s worked 23
years as an assistant coach at ﬁve
different colleges, two Canadian
Football League teams and one
World League ofAmerica football
team. Q ' “

Most recently, he served as
the offensive coordinator at Wis-
consin. He took.over the position
in '20o5, subsequently trans-
forming the Badgers’ offense into

one of the best in the country. In P

the 2011 season, Chryst’s offense
averaged 466.9 yards and 44.6
points per game. '

The Badgers ﬁnished as one of
the top ﬁve teams in scoring the
past two seasons.

Chryst recently ﬁnished what
was not only his ﬁrst spring prac-

tice" as Pitt’s head coach, but as i

the head coach of any program.
But he didn’t ﬁndvthe transition

‘ from coordinator to headcoach

difficult. A '

He said that muchlof the nec-
essary adjustment stems from
the number of changes he’s had

11 at Pitt

to endure at once, from being a

head coach for the ﬁrst time to ..

moving to a new city. As the head
of the program, he said he’s more
focused on “the big picture.”
“There’s just a lot involved
with it,” Chryst said. “I’ve enjoyed
being able to be with more [play-
ers]  It’s been different. That
doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad
or hard.”
. For Chryst, the most challeng-
ing aspect of his new job has been
the absence of his family — his

wife, Robin and their three chil- 

dren — from his everyday life.
While Chryst’s family has visited
a few weekends since Chryst took
the job at Pitt, Robin is still living
in Wisconsin while their kids ﬁn-
ish out the school year.

Still, Chryst has embraced the
Steel City, and he said his family

. has as well. He added that he’s

quickly become a fan of the Pitts-
burgh Penguins.

“It’s always getting to know
people,” he said of his move
to Pittsburgh. “There’s a lot of
things that are worth seeing, and

. [Pittsburgh’s] got a lot of charac-

ter to it.”

And according to Chryst, so
does his team.

“I think that this is a group
that wants to be as good as they
can be,” he said. “I’ve certainly
enjoyed being on the ﬁeld with
them. These are guys who really
like playing the game.

“The attitudes of the players
are always what give you energy,
and I’m certainly getting that
from this group.”

The players are “diving in” to

\

learning yet another new system,

Chryst said.

“I think anytime you have
something. new, there will be
some growing pains,” he said.
“It’s a process and you just have
to keep grinding away at it.”

For Chryst, this season is the ,,

beginning of a head coaching ca-
reer that could’ve started years
ago, but he saidhe never felt the
need to “be a head coach just to
be a head coach.”

“There is a great tradition [at

Pitt], and I feel it’s a tremendous 

opportunity to be able to be here -

and_feel like we can make a posi-
tive impact,” Chryst said. 3

Scott Hartnell and Craig Adams throw down in (lame 3 ofthe Pen.gtiii1s—Flyers series.‘

1 NHL playoffs filled with
  violence, dirty play   A

By Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ Writer

The National Hockey League has had a
spectacular ﬁrst round of hockey thus far,
featuring upsets, overtimes and — with

‘ the exception of one series in particular —

great defense and goaltending. But all of
that has been marred recently by dirty play
and cheap shots that are notvreminiscent
of the “playoff hockey” that the sport’s
fans are_ used to.

The Pittsburgh—Philadelphia series,
predicted to be the most exciting of the
ﬁrst round; has not disappointed — but
not in a good way for Penguins fans.

The Flyers have stunned the Stanley

Cup—favorite Penguins in jumping out to
a three—games—to—none ‘lead in a, series
that has featured the least sportsmanship
this writer has ever‘ witnessed. ‘Much to
the delight of the Philly faithful, the Pens
came off as punks on national television
in the Flyer’s 8-4 Game 3 romp. Though
it was exciting to -see two of the game’s
best players 4 Sidney Crosby and Claude
Giroux —'— square off in a ﬁght, what wasn’t
exciting was Arron Asham’s cross—check to

the throat and subsequent sucker punch to

Brayden Schenn (while the brutal cross-
check was in response to Schenn’s blatant
charge on defenseman Paul ‘Martin, the
punch when Schenn was on the ground

was inexcusable).

‘ Norwasjames Neal’s dirty head—hunting
tactics“ on Giroux and Sean Couturier
(whichruined an otherwise good game

A for him) or Flyer’s assistant coach Craig

Berube caught on tape instructing Wayne
Simmonds to go after Neal on his way to
the penalty box. Asham was suspended for
four games and Neal was suspended for
one, while Berube and Simmonds escaped
punishment. ‘

A Game 1 of the Nashville-Detroit series
featured another instance of dirty' play.

With the Nashville Predators up 3-2 in
the waning seconds of the game, big
defenseman and captain Shea Weber

grabbed the back of the Detroit Red Wings’ 2

Henrik Zetterberg’s neck and slammed
his head into the glass. Weber was ﬁned
only $2,500 for his egregious act, but he
was forced to atone by ﬁghting Wings’ big
man Todd Bertuzzi in the opening minutes
of Game 2. Bertuzzi — of dirty-play fame
~— was suspended for 20 games back in
2004-2005 for an on—ice attack that ended
center Steve Moore’s career.

Weber’s head-smashing tactics have

overshadowed’ the spectacular play of.

Nashville goalie Pekka Rinne, who has‘ led
the Preds to a 3-1 series lead.
But it doesn’t stop there. In Game 3 of

the intense Chicago—Phoenix series"— all
three games went into overtime —— the
Coyote’s Rafﬁ Torres left his feet and
leveled Blackhawks star Marian Hossa
with a shoulder to the head well after
Hossa had gotten rid of the puck. Hossa
was taken away on a stretcher and spent
the night in the hospital. Torres is a repeat
offender — he was suspended two games
this season and four last season for head-
targeting hits — and is likely ‘facing a
lengthy suspension. The Coyotes went on
to defeat the Hossa-less Blackhawks in
overtime to take a 2-1 series lead.

The saddest part about all of this
debauchery is that the great play of the
other teams in the playoffs isn’t being seen
because everyone is instead focusing on

the barbarity. The Los Angeles Kings have
ridden red—hot'goaltender Jonathan Quick
to a 3-0 series lead over the Canucks, who
were favorites to meet the Penguins in the
Stanley Cup ﬁnal. Likewise, the St. Louis

Blues lead the San Jose Sharks 2-1 behind‘

the stingiest defense in the league, and
Vezina Trophy favorite Henrik Lundqvist
of the New York Rangers has given up
only ﬁve goals in three games, giving his
team a.2—1 lead over the Ottawa Senators.

that features all one—goal games, and the
Florida Panthers are attempting to defeat
the New Jersey Devils (they lead 2-1) in
what would be their ﬁrst playoff series win
since they made the Stanley Cup Finals all
the way back_in 1996. %
