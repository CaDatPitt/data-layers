505 EIGCHOHS T0d0Y-' Mayor Hopefuls Face Issues
 HopefuIs'Views Similar   

By DEANNA LOUISE

If the candidates’ parallel
views on campus issues are any
indication, today’s race for School of
General Studies (SGS) Student
Cabinet Council President may be
vote splitting. ‘

John Della Vella and Bill Bair,
both present cabinet members,
agree the ratio of teaching
assistants, (TA’s) to full-ﬂedged
professors should be equated with
the same ratio as in the College of
Arts and Sciencesf

According to Bair, roughly 41
percent of SGS classes as opposed
to 26 percent in CAS are taught by
TA’s.

“That doesn’t necessarily mean
the instruction is poor,” Bair said.

“Teachers have to trained
somewhere, but we should have the
advantage of learning from exper-
ienced teachers as well,” Bair said.

“In SGS, students can go through
their entire college career with only
two or three professors,” Della
Vella said.

He suggested the student cabinet
work with SGS Dean Steele Gow to

TA’s in that school.

“Our faculty shouldn’t be more
than 25 percent TA’s or TF’s,”
Della Vella said.

He also advocated the completion
of a viable teaching evaluation
program like the one recently
approved _by the University Senate.

Pitt students whooped, clapped
and cheered when Jerry Zidanic
announced his candidacy for the
ofﬁce of Pittsburgh mayor Friday
afternoon.

“I'm no politician,’ he said
soberly', “I’ve never run for office,
but I’ve lived in the city for 21 years
and I've talkedto a lot of people. I
understand their need for jobs and
the need for better schools and

get anything done unless I ran.

Zidanic pulled the top ballot

position for primary election day,
May 17.’
V He spoke to fellow Pitt students
following presentations by Coun-
cilman Frank Lucchino; City
treasurer and Republican convert,
Joseph Cossetti, and County
Commissioner Tom Foerster before
a sketchy crowd of about 20 in the
Student Union Ballroom.

demonstrated partiality and favori-
tism towards the University of
Pittsburgh to the substantial
prejudice of plaintiff;

“This court has demonstrated
bias and prejudice against the
subject matter of this case; and

“This court has indicated a
personal bias and prejudice against
this plaintiff so that he could not
receive a fair, impartial hearing of
his case.”

The 12-page motion points to
McCune’s remarks concerning
biochemist Sharon Johnson's simi-
lar suit against the University as
indicative of the judge’s bias
against civil rights cases involving
Universities.

The portion of a- December 23,
1975, transcript underlined by
Oskoui’s attorneys quotes McCune
as saying:

“I am told the Johnson case
involves interminable hearings. I
suppose this could get into the same

problem. ..I do not-think this court is .

in the possession of the equipment
with which to run universities or

“So I repeat that I have some
desire to head this matter off and to
come to some other decision than a
Sharon Johnson-type proceeding...

“As a practical matter, , the
Courts cannot deal with any more
Sharon Johnson cases or at least
very many more of them.”

In his deposition, Oskoui swore
the duration of the case's ajudica-

to “deteriorate immeasurably” and

GANDHI LOSES PARLIAMENT
SEAT; LIFTS INDIA’S
EMERGENCY STATE

NEW DELHI, India (AP)-
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi lost
her seat in parliament, and her
ruling Congress party suffered
major losses to the opposition in
returns early today from India’s
national election.

Shortly after Mrs. Gandhi’s

defeat was announced, she ordered
the lifting of-India-’s 21-month-old
state of emergency, official sources
said. A formal proclamation ending‘
the emergency was signed by the
chief of state, acting President B.D.
Jatti, at 4 a.m.
 The state of emergency had been
declared on behalf of Mrs. Gandhi
by the late President Fakhruddin
Ali Ahmed on June 26, 1975.
Ahmed died last month.

PARIS (AP)—A Socialist-

70 per cent of France’s big cities in
runoff municipal elections yester-

_ day, gaining votes on a scale that

could bring it to national power in
parliamentary voting next year.
But in Paris, a moderate strong-

This assured Chirac of election by

higher-crime area than in the
county. “You only think crime is
higher in the city because you are
only aware of the crime here,” he
said.

He said Pittsburghers have to be
educated to the advantages of
city-life and said part of his job as
mayor would be to sell the idea of
city-living to young families cur-
rently moving to the suburbs.

City treasurer Joe Cossetti, who
last week repudiatedrhis Democra-
tic Party membership for Republi-
can endorsement as mayoral
candidate, said the city’s problems
have to be spearheaded by practical
rather than spectacular projects. In
a thinly veiled dig against the
endorsed Democrat, Foerster,
Cossetti said, “The county has not
repaired one single bridge in the
last 10 years. Repairing bridges is
not very sexy. Building a swimming
pool is much more fun.”

He said the city has to allocate its
funds parsimoniously, offering
limited services to the poor.

A few of the 15 students present
bristled at the following statement,

_ “The $132,000,000 city budget we

have covers highways, refuse,
police and ﬁre maintenance. To
service the needs of the poor, we’d
go bankrupt.”

Asked if he places plugged-up
potholes over the needs of the poor,
Cossetti responded, “I’m suggest-
ing we'll go broke if we try and

We can’t handle it. The state and
federal government has to contri-
bute to social services.”

Cossetti explained his hasty
conversion from Democrat to
Republican by saying he will not be
using Democratic or Republican
techniques as mayor.

When pressed, he said the
petitions that granted him a spot on
the ballot were circulated without
his name on them because the
Republican party did not have an

‘ agreed candidate to run prior to the

petition deadline.

He said the improper proceed-
ings caused him much embarrass-
ment and if it had been up to him, he
would have circulated them proper-
ly.

Cossetti was in court last week to
determine whether signatures
gathered under those circumstan-
ces were valid. He assured his
listeners the signatures had been
validated Thursday, giving him
more than enough signatures to
stay in the running.

, Qthe iﬁttt ﬁrms 

.70 yea“ of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

 

ROTC Support Doubted

The Student Government Board’s vote to recommend credit

not have been made without more debate and consideration of fact.
It is all well and good to support ROTC accreditation if a
majority of Pitt’s students do, but it is doubtful the student support
actually exists. b _
The Board based its decision on a petition presented to them

containing 2,446 student signatures in favor of accreditation, yet A

not one member questioned whether or not this petition could be

accepted at its face-value. Only 2,500 of a possible 12,000 students V

were represented.
Maybe 85 percent of the students here support ROTC, but that
conclusion cannot be drawn from the results of the petition passed.
One must remember the events surrounding the petition drive.
ROTC conducted a media-hyped drive the likes of which would
bring pride to any Madison Avenue advertising executive trying to

' sell spinach or the swine flu.

There were the teaser “l Did lt” buttons and ads, and signers of
the petition were treated to free orange juice frisbees.

Though the above incidents occurred repeatedly, SGB gullibly
fell for the ROTC sob story, lock, stock and barrel.

The blame does not fall entirely on SGB. Those 2,446 students
who signed the petition without strongly believing in the ROTC
stand have done nothing but drown out the voice of the opposition
with their apathetic number. To sign a petition because of free
orange juice or a frisbee is behavior expected of a five-year-old
watching Saturday morning cartoon commercials,‘ not students at a
leading eastern university.

Then there’s the ROTC campaign. Its free frisbees and orange
juice have turned a serious debate into a circus.

The quick decision by SGB is evidence they do not comprehend
their own influence in the matter. If five people had voted in favor
of instead of against ROTC, the last time time the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences voted on the question, it would be accredited today.

Wednesday's endorsement by the SGB could sway at least five
people on the FAS council. Power like this deserves more care
about the direction in which it is channeled.

 More Answers Needed

Friday's response by the Union of Graduate Employes to an
editorial questioning the benefit of unionization clears up many
questions, but leaves enough unanswered that any decision
concerning the movement cannot be made in good conscience.

Increased wages and benefits can be budgeted by a reassessment
of budget priorities, they explain. But there is no guarantee this is
what the University would do. In the past, when short a few
million dollars, Pitt has raised tuition, not juggled priorities.
Besides, juggling priorities can deny funds to deserving programs.

A union would give the employes a stronger voice in University
politics. Whose voice would be drowned out? Most likely one with
little power—the undergraduate’s.

These contradictions do not close the case for graduate employe
unionization, but demonstrate the need for more proof before any
support can be offered.

Not Yet Ready for Atwood A

By TOM WASELESKI

1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

Washington, D.C.

Dear Tom:

Regarding your invitation for the
First Family and me to spend a
night in your community as part of
our “meet the people” program, I
am sorry to say I'll have to turn you
down and anyone else in Oakland
who might invite me for the next 15
or 20 years.

First off, my Secret Service just
isn’t equipped to handle the sort of
danger one may encounter on any
given day in your neighborhood.
Although I like to consider myself
among the bolder of American
politicians—brave mayors and gov-
ernors who have walked among the
ﬂames of riot-torn cities——our
preliminary check has shown

' venturing a walk down Atwood or’

Meyran is certain suicide.

As a matter of fact, several of my
front men have yet to return from
making their inspection of Oakland,
and that was ﬁve months ago.

Another consideration we have is

CORRECTION

To give Pitt's graduate employes
a $1,000 per year salary increase
would cost .56 percent of the
University’s 1976 operating budget,
not 56 percent, a ﬁgure erroneously
printed in Friday's letter from the
Union of Graduate Employes. The
Pitt News regrets this typo graphica
error. .

food and lodging. Now I understand
you have offered me your bed in
Tower C. Torn, that’s mighty
hospitable of you, and me and my
family are much obliged. But from
what I understand that’s about 60
percent of your living’ space, and
quite frankly, we wouldn't want you
sleeping in the hall.

By the way, is that room used for
students in some sort of behavioral
experiment? When I was in the

» Navy, we used to put baby mice in

match boxes, then let them out after
ﬁve days. I imagine the test they’re
running you through in Tower C
shows more interesting results.

rmnnssrons

You’ve also said if we’d rather
have roomier accommodations, you
had some friends on Atwood who'd
be glad to double up so my family
could be more comfortable. Again,
we all thank you, but by the same
token we realize what a restful night
means to a university student, even
though they’ve offered us use of
their quad system and they’ve said
the neighbors won’t mind much.

As far as food goes, we thought of
bagging it since we're not on the
Towers meal plan and, wouldn’t
think of imposing on the kitchen’s
dubious talents. (Our investigators
said you students were fortunate
enough to have the best roast beef
au jus this side of Schenley Hall,
and four times a week!)

And we’d really like to sit down '

some day for dinner with your
Atwood friends, but Ros_alyn and I
aren't much on delicacies (we’re so

move). At any rate, we’d rather not
bag it either since I’ve had it up to
here with peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches. .

I guess the ﬁnal factor in our
deciding not to visit your lovely
community was the hostility our
advance men experienced in your
bars, drug stores and supermar-
kets. Every one of our processed
surveillance photos. has shown a
house camera taking a photo of our
men! We believe there are more

‘buzzers, alarms, bells and hidden

lenses in Oakland than the CIA has
in South America. And not only
does it frighten us as American
citizens, but we’ve put the
Pentagaonon the case to make sure
we're not behind on the latest
technology.

Add to these things the
congestion (we’ve ﬁgured out it

 
 
 

would take three days for_us to ‘

complete a 24-hour stay in Oakland)
and the sirens (you know us
smalltown folk just" rush to the
window when we hear an ambul-
ance), and we might as well just stay
in D.C. '

I want to thank you and your
friends just the same, Tom, and let
me just say that after we "complete
this series of visits to smalltown
America, we’re thinking of doing
another series called “The Presi-
dent at the Front Lines,” and your
location will no doubt receive our
utmost attentior

Sincerely,

Letter Explains Mock Ballot

I On Wednesday, March 23, and

Thursday, March 24, the Faculty of

Arts and Sciences-Graduate Stu-
dent Organization (FAS-GSO) will
be sponsoring a mock collective

bargaining election for those’

teaching assistants, teaching fel-
lows, graduate student assistants
and graduate student researchers in
FAS.

As it has been published
elsewhere, the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board (PLRB) found that
TA’s, TF‘s, GSA’s and GSR's are
graduate students employed by the
University, but PLRB was unable to
determine whether they could be
covered by Pennsylvania Act 195.
The proposal presented to FAS-
GSO would allow the graduate
student employes a means by which
they can express their views on
collective bargaining.

The mock election is designed to i

be an informal» poll of graduate

-_.-.-,—.-,.-,. ,  ;--.’.-X4.siI;u'3uv.svm‘7r;:#.aE3.nr:rir4a'4n§¢?-I§'l=hosIf§’).‘  93

employes. . Since it is a mock
election, the results would not be
legally binding and would not be
subject to the auspices of PLRB. In
a reply to an inquiry about the
University’s position on holding the
mock election, FAS-GSO was
informed by William J. I-Iannan,
director of legal services, that there
are no legal problems in holding the
election. On further consultation
with Alden E. Bowen, coordinator
of the campus judicial system, and
Hayes C. Stover, attorney at law,
FAS-GSO received the same
response. With these questions
being settled, FAS-GSO went ahead‘
with preparations.

To make the election impartial,
FAS-GSO, contacted several unions

as to their willingness to appear as a '

choice for collective bargaining
agent on the ballot. Only one
favorable reply was received, from
the Union of. Graduate‘ Employes.

Because of this, only one choice is
printed on the ballot but the
graduate employe is free to specify
any union of his/her choice.

The ballot will read as follows:
1. Do you favor unionization of
graduate employes?

If yes, which union would you
prefer?
a. Union of Graduate Em-
ployes
‘b. Other (please specify)
The results of this mock election
will be made public to all members
of the University community

.following tabulation by FSA-GSO.

FAS-GSO neither supports nor
opposes a collective bargaining
agent for graduate employes, but
does feel that some method should
be" made available for them to
express their views.

Co-president, FAS-GSO _

Women’s Athletic

Director Charged

This letter is being written in the
interest of those women athletes
who are and will be attending the
University of Pittsburgh under the
“direction” of the present women’s
athletic administration. I wish to
protest the nature of this ‘ ‘director-
ship,” which I believe to be highly
unethical and inconsiderate to the
athletic and interpersonal growth of
the women whom it is in existence to
insure. I am referring to the not
infrequent practice of the women’s
athletic director of privately con-
tacting women athletes in order to:

(1) Attempt to coerce women
athletes into ‘playing at a higher skill
level (at times when it may not be
within their capacity to do so at the
time because of recent injury,
academic worries or temporary
emotional difficulty).

(2) Obtain from women athletes
opinions concerning staff members
and using this information to make
decisions about those persons
without the due ethical process of
confronting the accused as well.

(3) Make verbal promises for
athletic aid to women athletes as
incentive to transfer from other
schools or to remain here when
unhappy—when it is the privilege of
each individual coach to commit
athletic aid for their own particular
team. I .

(4) Threaten women athletes who
are not reaching their “fullest skill
potential” (in the opinion of the
women’s athletic director) with
future loss of athletic aid when it is
not within her right or responsibility
to do so. ~

These conversations have usually
taken place without the coaches’
knowledge, the result being the
undermining inﬂuence of the
women’s athletic director’s threats
and the total usurpation of the
coaches’ authority in the eyes of the

‘Monday, March 21, 1977—THE PITT NEWS—Page5 I

athlete. The rights of all parties
involved (coaches and athletes) are
violated when any person in
authority allows personal prejudi-
ces to enter into and inﬂuence
decisions that should be made on a
purely professional basis.

The net affect on our women
athletes is what I am most
concerned about. Those who are
naive about the _actions of our
women’s athletic director are taken
in by her “professional” demeanor
and give any requested informa-
tion; they unknowingly cooperate in
the undoing of others within the
athletic department. Meanwhile,
the few women athletes who know
what’s happening within the
women’s administration, but can do
nothing about the situation for fear
of retaliation, live with the
frustration of watching while the

women’s athletic director continues

unchecked in her unethical and
inconsiderate exploitation of the
position she holds—not in the
interests of each. individual woman
‘student-athlete, but in the interest
of “winning at all costs.”

Unionization: The

Right to Choose

The Graduate Student Organiza-
tion of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences is conducting an election
on the 23rd and 24th of March that
permits graduate employes to vote
on two very important propositions.
The graduate employes will express
their opinion on collective bargain-
ing and, if they favor collective
bargaining, will choose an organi-
zation to represent them.

We represent several positions
concerning collective bargaining for
the faculty. In our faculty collective
bargaining election last spring, the
faculty discussed and debated the
issues and decided them in an open
and fair election. We believe that
the graduate employes have a
similar right to debate and decide
these same issues.

We trust the graduate employes

"will recognize the importance of this

election and that they will consider
the issues and cast their ballots. We
realize theresults of this election
are not legally binding, but we trust
the University administration will

carefully consider the results of this
election when they develop their
plans concerning the future of
collective bargaining for graduate
employes.

Article shoddy

We would like to make a few
comments on an article that
appeared in The Pitt News on
Wednesday, March 16, titled
“Residents, Pitt Staff Meet.” This
article had to have been the most
shoddy piece of journalism that we
have ever seen. The woman who
covered the event apparently could
not understand the jist of the panel
discussion because she completely
misconstrued and distorted what
was said. She also failed to mention
Councilman William Coyne, who
was one of the panelists. A-picture

identify Trish.

seminar oniMarch 14 and March 15  
in the ballroom. Our purpose was to

acquaint students with the many
agencies and "services in the
Oakland area. Several TV and radio
stations as well as the Pittsburgh
Press found this event worth
covering, however, our own Pitt

The fact that there was poo

attendance, poor coverage and 
misrepresentation by The Pitt News .

reflects the unawarcness and

apathy the seminar was hoping to _ , -2

some good points, his comments

The GSO-sponsored collective bargaining election will be
more than an opinion poll. A big turnout and a strong major-
ity in support of the UGE will demonstrate that the union
does in fact represent graduate employees. But it will do
even more than this. A strong vote will be an active force. It
will in itself place pressure on the administration to.act on
the legitimate grievances of its graduate employees.

Non-binding collective bargaining elections have often led to
formal recognition ‘and a contract. This was precisely the ex-
perience of the Pittsburgh public school teachers, who have
built a strong union and now hold a contract with the Board
of Education.

Yet even without formal recognition a union with wide popu-
lar support can begin to improve working conditions. The
Union of Graduate Employees has already had a positive
impact on wages and health care. Ademonstration of wide
popular support in this election will greatly increase the un-
ion's power to improve both the working and learning en-
vironment here at Pitt.

In this sense the election is not really a “mock” election at-
all. It is a very real opportunity for TA’s, TF’s, GSA’s and
GSR’s to bring collective bargaining to the University of
Pittsburgh.

rk-goers Pelted

By Pigeon Problems

By STEVE SYBERT

Ever been walking down the
street on a sunny day being pelted
by what you thought was rain? Or
have you ever sat down on a park
bench, then realized that what you
sat on by mistake was not
chocolate?

.Those are just two of the
problems imposed by feral, or
common everyday pigeons—the
ones you almost trip over walking
down busy urban streets, like in
Pittsburgh, and hound you like
scavangers for food in serene
surroundings like Schenley Park.

But pigeons create more severe
problems. They carry diseases
harmful to human health like
encephalitis or sleeping sickness;
cryptococcal meningitis, a brain
inﬂammation; orinyhosis, a highly
contagious‘ viral disease; salmon-
ellosis, or bacterial food poisoning;
and histoplasmosis, a respiratory
fungus ailment."

Pigeons attract noxious pests like ,

bugs, ﬂeas, ticks, mites and,’ most
of all, rats, which invade buildings

  

occupied by pigeon nests. They
have been identiﬁed as a common
source of chicken mites, which
infect humans and cause skin
diseases. Pigeon droppings
contaminate food and water and
foster the breeding of ﬂies as well as
deface buildings and monuments
with an ugly mess.

Pigeons are not only a nuisance,
they are dangerous—a thought to
be remembered the next time you
wish to feed or handle the otherwise
harmless-looking birds.

“They can be a terrible
nuisance,” said Edward Blotzer,
Jr., president of Animal Care and
Welfare (ACW) in Pittsburgh. “I
know a guy whb picked up a
diseased pigeon and didn’t know it
and was off work for six months
because of it.”

There are, however, a number of
methods currently in :use to
eliminate or at least control
pigeons, especially in the urban

‘environment. Chemicals applied at

frequent intervals kill some, but

I merely chase the others to another

location. Traps require extensive

’ \
\\ x‘ I .

i.‘

“Mi

manpower (baiting, emptying,
etc.), but it has been shown that
pigeons can reproduce faster than
trapping can eliminate them.

Shooting the pigeons is another
popular method, but the hazards
are apparent. This not only causes
safety problems, but the deceased
pigeons must be tr_acked down and
collected before children and pets
come in contact with the diseased
birds.

Blotzer sees these methods as
time-consuming, costly, relatively
ineffective and most of all, cruel.

“We get calls (at ACW) about the

mills all the time,” he said. “They
use chemicals to kill the pigeons.
Being concerned about the welfare
of animals, I don’t want to see them
suffer.

‘ ‘My main concern is the humane
care of the pigeons,” Blotzer
continued. “Poison is not an
instantaneous death. Shooting an
animal is a humane means of death
as long as it is an instantaneous
death. But you have to go pick up
the bird and you can't discharge a
weapon in certain municipalities."

Shooting is not ‘allowed in
Pittsburgh, where pigeons seem to

“When I was an undergraduate
at Cambridge, we were given two
weeks of three-hour exams. One of
these exams was an essay because
after two years of Cambridge you
should be able to write for 3 hours.
The essay was to write on Charles
Fox. I didn’t know who he was, so
after one ‘hour of sitting there I

wrote ‘Charles Fox is a mediocre '

baseman for the Cincinnatti Reds. ’ I
graduated with an honors degree,”
said George Plimpton, author of
“Paper Lion” and editor of “The
Paris Review,” starting his hour-
long lecture on “Professionalism
and Writing Non-ﬁction” at Pitt’s
ﬁfth annual Writers’ Conference
Saturday in a packed Student Union
Ballroom. ‘ ' i .

~ Plimpton felt the subject should
change from professionalism to
“insecurity and despair because
there is no such thing in a writer,
unless it’s getting your copy in on
time or putting ‘-30-’ at the end of
the story.”

He spent most of his speech citing
examples of insecurity in writers he
has known. “I got to interview
E.M. Foster (a British novelist)
when he was a resident during my
college years on the craft of writin g.
Foster hadn’t written anything
since 1912 because he was
destroyed by ﬁction technicalities. ’ ’

Foster had started a novel in 1914 .

but lost control of his characters as
they gained-personalities and never

-_ , ﬁnished it. . " ‘ -'

i,,-..,...,......-g-..q..4...«:...-...-...._..g.---9-J-a-gar»-(62696-’e4¢4"-V‘-' 6;‘ . t—- —

Plimpton then asked Ernest
Hemmingway about his craft.
“Hemmingway always has these
white birds appear in his" sex
scenes,”. and Plimpton asked
Hemmingway about their meaning.
“Hemmingway was great company
but when I asked him his mood
changed completely, his eyes got
small and he asked me ‘Can you do
any better?’ ”

Plimpton said it is “appallingly.
difﬁcult” to write. “There are
about 25 miles between the brain
and the- ﬁngertips,” " he said,
offering suggestions as to how other
writers write. “Poet Hart Crane
had to lock himself in a room, get
roaring drunk and play the Victrola
at full volume.

“Joseph Heller, author of
‘Catch-22’ and ‘Something “Hap-
pened,’ waits for the first sentence
from which evolves an entire novel.
It took him seven to eight years to
ﬁnd ‘Closed doors give me the
willies,’ the ﬁrst sentence of

“Something Happened.’ ” _

‘Plimpton said he was struck by
the title “Professionalism” because
most of the writers he knows are
unprofessional, especially Hunter
Thompson, whom he considers the
best journalist alive.

He furthered this by telling about
the George Foreman-Muhammed
Ali ﬁght in Zaire that he and
Thompson covered. Thompson did
not go to the ﬁght; instead he
dumped his remaining marijuana
supply into the hotel swirnmign pool
and lay naked in the pool. He told

 

i,gg..o..~.g4 asp:-an

   
  
 

Plimpton, ‘‘It was not the best way
to get a high.” He never covered
the ﬁght but Plimpton is sure
Thompson will eventually write

something that will surpass‘ any- ”
thing written on the ﬁght to date. '1
A Plimpton also said that when

“Rolling Stone” sent Thompson to
cover the America Cup Yacht Race,
Thompson spent the evening trying
to paint an obscenity on the side of

the Australian Yacht because he"

believed the yachts would make
good advertisement carriers. ‘ ‘This
story has very little to 'do with
professionalism, but a great deal to
do with paranoia and insecurity of a
writer, ’ ’ Plimpton said.

Norman Mailer also covered the
Foreman-Ali ﬁght. Mailer decided
to run with Ali so he could write
more understandably. Ali out ran
Mailer and left him alone in the
middle of a dark night in Africa.
Mailer heard a lion roar, which was
later discovered to be a lion in the
Presidential zoo.

But as he was running back to
camp he began to fantasize,
“Normal Mailer, died at 51, taken
by a lion in Zaire,” written in all the
high school anthologies.

Plimpton said this subject
intrigued him, too, so he wrote
around to his friends asking them
about the manner of death they
wanted.

Gore Vidal wrote back saying,
“When I go, everyone ‘else goes

with me because you are all
ﬁgments of myimagination. So you ’ ,

run wild in areas downtown such as
Market Square, and has come under
attack in smaller municipalities by
local chapters of the Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .

(SPCA).

Last summer in’Butler, Pa., for
instance, the Butler County Chapter
of the SPCA ﬁled a formal complaint
against the Butler City Police for
taking their target practice with
pigeons in the railroad yard in the
center of town or near the junior
high school, also downtown, and not
collecting the deceased birds. The
police were forced to curtail their
practice.

“In animal control, there is a half
billion dollars spent annually in the
United States,” Blotzer cited.
“They ought to attack the source
and spay the animals. We're only
putting Mercurochrome on a
cancer.”

Is there a way to safely,
effectively and humanely control
such pests as pigeons and other
animals? The Animal Health
Division of G.D. Searle Co. in
Skokie, 111., says yes and Blotzer
agrees. .

The answer appears to lie in
Ornitrol, a chemosterilant that
allows control, not eradication, of
pesty pigeons—in other words;
birth control for pigeons. The orally.
administered chemical, which red-:~
uces both the rate of egg-laying and.

the cabinet position vacated by
Patty Thompson.

“I admit straight out that I was

my experience equals, if not

Della Vella said. “I’ll be going to

Della Vella said he would
continue working with Dean Gow to
establish a scholarship fund from
the excess activities fees acrued
over the past ﬁve years.

A referendum on the ballot
asking night students if they desire
a mandatory $16 health fee for all
SGS students was pushed by Della
Vella. He said he believes, contrary
to the results of an SGS survey on
the issue last year, many working
students want the CAS health plan.

“Not all students have the Blue

they did,” Della Vella said. “I

in 1967.

Despite consistent success in
various ﬁeld studies, Ornitrol has
not caught on in Pittsburgh, a fact
that disturbs Blotzer.

“I’ve brought it to the attention of
the City Department of Parks and
Recreation,” Blotzer said, “but
they have yet to reply. They have a
county rat control program but not a
pigeon control program. I’d like to
see how it works out, even help pay
for it if the city would put the
program into effect.”

Ornitrol is whole kernel corn bait
coated with .1 percent by weight
with a potent inhibitor of reproduc-
tion in pigeons. The whole kernel
corn is used to prevent consumption
by desirable species such as song
birds, while little activity has been
noted in mammals such as dogs and
cats and none in human handlers of
the chemicals.

For best results, Ornitrol is fed to
pigeons during the ﬁrst 10 days of
April in climatic regions such as
Pittsburgh’s, as well as late
summer or early fall. The device
renders the birds sterile for
approximately six months and

causes no other apparent effects.
In Bangor, Maine, according to
Searle research information, the
pigeon population was reduced
from some 2,500 birds to about 300
following a two-year treatment
program. Generations of the pigeon
merely die off, leaving behind less
offspring in each case.
According to Searle, however, it

would take $250 worth (300 pounds)

pigeons. A ton of the chemical,
needed to reach 2,500 birds, would
cost over $2,000, a ﬁgure which the
City of Pittsburgh regards as too
costly.

“There was some controversy as
to whether they (Searle) were going

Ornitrol can reduce the pigeon

  allet: Looking ForMore Than Pe iection

By DENISE DAILEY

Perfection is an admirable quality.
Regardless of one’s field of endeavor,
much time and energy must be invested
to achieve that highly valued
state—professionalism. But when the
field is dance, perfection is not enough.

Everyone knows the Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre (PBT) is a professional
company. The dancers work hard on
their often ﬂawless technique and their
performances are well-rehearsed.
However, it is more enjoyable to see
something more than perfectly
symmetrical lines, perfectly balanced
lifts and perfectly turned-out leaps.

Daffodils each spring, like “Swan

Lake,” are a common, predictable
occurrence; nothing to get excited about,
and yet, who hasn't been thrilled at the
sight of the daffodils again this year?
For a ballet to be thrilling, it needs this
same sense of newness, a feeling from
the dancers that this is the first time the
story has been told, the first time the
movements have been seen.

“Swan Lake” is a fairy tale. Once
upon a time, princess Odette came under
the spell of an evil sorcerer, Baron von
Rothbart, who transformed her into a
Swan, and only in the hours of darkness
could she assume human form. True to
the magic of fairy tales, the spell would
only be broken if a man swore eternal
fidelity to her and married her.

Good-bye Mary,
We Will Miss You

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Admit it. Deep down we all love Mary
Tyler Moore. She’s become so much of
an institution since her days as Laura
Petrie on the “Dick Van Dyke Show”
and particularly throughout her seven-
year reign on her own show that criticism
‘of MTM is downright un-American.

Mary’s life as the prom queen of
Saturday night prime time television
came to an end Saturday night. A whole
era, in fact, was switched into the never
never land of reruns when Mary flipped
off the lights in the WJM newsroom for
the last time.

Seven years have passed since she first
ventured into that office. Arriving in
Minneapolis to forget an unhappy love
affair, Mary was swept into the turmoil
of the WJM personnel: crusty producer
Lou Grant, writer Murray Slaughter,
and narcisstic Ted Baxter—the
anchorman with the handsome face,
pear-shaped tones and the personality of
a test pattern. There were friendships

with landlady Phyllis Lindstrom——last of -

the original space cadettes, and sarcastic
Rhoda Morgenstern who became Mary’s
closest confident.

The scripts were excellent. There was
a surreal realism to the “Mary Tyler
Moore Show” that few programs have
equaled. It was a cross between Norman
Lear’s gutsy grassroots arid the fairy tale
tradition of “My Three Sons.”

Hayward

 

Songwriter
Justin Hayward
Deram Records, DES 18073

Might as well say it right from the-
start. This is my first nominee for album
ofthe year.

Since the Moody Blues decided to go
solo for a stretch, we’ve gotten a string
of six albums, only two of which were
worthwhile, and Justin Hayward was
part of both of them.

The first one, “Bluejays," was a
collaboration between Hayward and co-
M00d." John Lodge, undoubtedly the
parent group's two foremost writers. I

-picked that as the best record of I975

even though no one bought it and no
statiorl played it. After all, what do
people know?

The second is “Songwriter,” and is he!

"Without L0dgc’s skillful harmony,
one would expect Hayward to be up the
creek. But Hayward pulls it out
nevertheless, re-tracking his own
harmony, which sounds similar to Lodge
anyway.

As‘ the Moody Blues’ lead guitarist,
Hayward brings some fine finger work
to these l0 tracks. Whether electric or
acoustic, Hayward is forever pleasant
amid lush arrangements. ‘

You felt as if you knew Mary and her
television family, that you ran into
people like them on any given day.
Sometimes the situations were a bit
fantastic; for instance, the time Chuckles
the Clown was dressed as a peanut and
was trampled to- death by a hungry
elephant, but Mary and company
reacted as real people would.

Critics say the most valuable thing
about the show was that it dealt with a
woman over 30 who lived alone. And
Mary did show she could be a success

The story did have some exciting
moments. Baron von Rothbart’s
costume, designed by l’ift‘s own main-
stage set designer, Henry Heymann, was
amazing. His expansive wings and
feathered head held him in the fantastic
world between man and animal.

Also, visiting principal dancer, Dinko
Bogdanic, performed nobly as the
prince.

Stuart Sebastian choreographed two
world premieres for PBT, “Reverences”
and “Pas de Deux Eclatant,” both of
which were performed Saturday night.

“Reverences” began with an
interesting arrangement of dancers on
stage. For a while it seemed as though
these relationships would be fully

W

explored. Singly, or in groups of two or
three, they flowed among each other in
varied patterns with a lift or a leap
punctuating the flow.

But soon the variations became
predictable and Sebastian's ballet was
neither modern enough (daring to
experiment with different movements
and shapes) nor traditional
enough(telling a story to maintain the
action) to continue for that length of
time.

The costumes were pretty in soothing
pastel colors, the harpsichord music by
Arcangelo Corelli was pretty and
eventually the entire effect was as
soothing as a pretty fairy tale.

The brightest spark of the evening was
Dagmar Kessler’s performance in “Pas

ARTS/

de Deux Eclatant." Veteran that she is,
Kessler still gives that feeling of enjoying
every move she makes for her audience.

There was nothing special about the
choreography, but Kessler and Dennis
Poole, principal dancer with the Joffrey
Ballet, danced as if it were the first time
they had ever done a tour-jetee or an
arabesque.

Ballet is a classic art and the joy an
audience feels comes from seeing those
classic pieces again and again. But the
joy of rediscovery is lost when dancers
do not go beyond physical perfection of

!\

the movement, to capture the sensitive '

and exciting quality of feeling those
classic stories and movements contain.

\

without a husband, without being
widowed even, "without meddlesome
parents or even a doting boyfriend.

But the best thing was that the
characters were allowed to grow. At

first, Mary was the perfect All-American -
girl, the winner in the game of life. But
eventually, she was permitted to know-

Great Music Not Played

By TOM WASELESKI

The best song on the album, however,
has scarcely a touch of guitar in it.
“Country Girl” is a catchy, swirling
ditty about tumbling in. love in some
Potter County meadow. Thegvocals
carry the strength here along ‘with
glittering percussion and reeling
keyboards. Hayward sings fresh
harmony with a female voice to which he
gives no credit, even though she surfaces
beautifully on other cuts.

Along the same rocking lines is
“Tightrope,” this time with’, that
unmistakcable electric six-stringlcarrying
the pace. The chorus uses a good deal of
synthetic horns, never letting us forget
where this guy’s roots are.

The title track is a two-part effort; the
opening half a nicely gliding vocal
supported by piano, bass and
percussion. The chorus is somewhat
damaged by overly piercing synthesizer,
but all is resolved once the time shifts in
part two, where it re-emerges, this time

couched in a more brutal musical
background.
On the softer side, “One Lonely

Room" uses a touch of sax, just to add a
sound of the vogue. Hayward’s use of
orchestration is ever-discriminating and
here it heightens superbly. Thellyrics are
pure Moody Blues: “..—.You took the

wind ‘right out my sails,.you took my

train right off the.rails..,.”

  

“Stage Door” is also easy. on the

nerves, as is “Raised on Love,”

even spent a night in jail. And her
confusion at the experiences was
especially touching.

The final show was not a happy one.
New ownership at WJM decides the staff
is responsible for the low ratings and
everyone is handed the pink slip except
airhead Ted.

“He said, ‘l’m going to have to let you
guys go,’ ” Mary puzzles. ‘‘I ’don’t
know ifl’m really fired. lmean, l’m'not
a guy.”

Rollin’ On

A phone call to the owner confirms
the fact that _she’s been handed her
walking papers. The last newscast is
taped, Ted concludes it with an inane
farewell to his friends and there are tears
and hugs of comfort. And Mary, after a
poignant last look at WJM, shuts off the
lights, much like Laura Wingfield in The
Glass_ Menagerie, and goes off ‘to
wherever 30-plus—year-old
careerwomen go when their career is
cancelled. So ends an American
Saturday }night tradition.

Good bye, Mary. We’re going to miss
you. -

  Kicking Up The Past  
  Just Doesn't Work   

By.JtM FARERI

Rollin’ On
Steve Gibbons Band

MCA-2243
The Steve Gibbons Band is an
anachronism. Their curent release,

. “Rollin’ On,” is from some vague and

hazy past_that strikes few familiar chords

,5‘-today.

Perhaps thecover of “Rollin’ On” is a
good way to gauge the band: it shows
Gibbons in‘ cowboy garb, his
microphone in one hand and a joint in
the other. He is leaning heavily on '60s
nostalgia, the. good ol’ days when
rock’n’rolLand getting ‘high still meant
something.’

Gibbons, and the troupe—two
guitarists, bassist and drummer— are
Englishmen masquerading as primeval
American country ro.ck‘n’rollers.
They’re the great grandfathers of bands

[piece of ,r,epeate,d history. —

' such as Lynard Skynard and Z Z Top.
_ They sound as if they’ve just discovered

rock and country can mix.

Most of their influences have gone to
rest, having had their day in the late ’60s.
There are a few recognizable borrowings
from The Byrds and Bob Dylan, and the
album features numbers written by
Chuck Berry and Jerry Reed. The
mentors of The Steve Gibbons Band
aren’t teachers; they are staples to be
imitated. '

Gibbons writes all the band's original
material in his consistent, basic country

rock style. He is definite about the kind ’

of music he wants to play and offers no
surprises.

The best numbers are the faster ones
such as “Light Up Your Face” and the
titletrack. Gibbons can write and sing
rocka lot better than country music. He
does it withmore originality, too,

The bad numbers are slower, more
country and evidence of a '60s British

pop influence that Gibbons doesn’t
handle well. When he’s bad, he’s the
worst.

Lyrically, Gibbons is mediocre. There ‘
is a rhythm in his words to suit the
music, but not much of anything else.
He is most adept at the humorous ballad
“Mr. .lones,“.a song about a pttshcr
making junkies of the unsuspecting.

The talent utilized in “Rollin’ On“ is
neither fresh nor exceptional; the guitar
workin “Tupelo Mississippi Flash" is
the sole highpoint of the album.

But the first question about the Steve
Gibbons Band isn't how good they are;
it's whether or not their brand of music
is still plausible in I977. With sortie
updating and a little polishing, perhaps it
is, but we don't have that herealid ,.
consequently “Rollin’ On” is“ just a

Ullmann’s Changing’

lfs OnlyMissing A Smile

B3‘ PATTY TASCARELLA

Changing
Liv Ullmann
Alfred A. Knopf

“Changing” is the none too apt title
of Norwegian actress Liv Ullman’s
autobiography. Ullmann’s attitudes
have apparently been stationary since
birth: she is still unable to comprehend

' events that happened when she was five,

let alone come to terms with them.

Ullmann portrays herself as a
perpetual victim: of people (especially
former lover, director Ingmar Bergman),
situations (her entire childhood seems to
have been a trauma) and institutions
(from marriage to the Hollywood star-
making process). It makes for a very
depressing book.

Surely in her lifetime, Ullmann has
had both personal and professional
happiness. Film critics praise her as one
of the greatest actresses of our time; she
is a two-time Oscar nominee and the
American Film Critics award winner in
1972 and has won scores of awards at
European film festivals. She has been
married to a Norwegian psychiatrist, had
a five-year affair with Bergman and is
the mother of a nine-year-old daughter.
But littlejoy is shown in “Changing.”

Probably the lightest moments in the
book come in fragments of conversation
between Ullmann and daughter Linn.
The honesty and openness of their
dialogue permits both mother and
daughter to emerge without distortion.
But when Ullman discusses her feelings
about motherhood, the focus is on her
tremendous guilt at leaving Linn while
she works, heaping more gloom into a
book that fairly begs for a moment of
levity. '

To Ullmann’s credit, she realizes she is
as much a victim of her self as of others.
The years with Bergman. on the island of
Faro draw this out well. Ullmann played
the doormat under Bergman’s feet, the

audience to his genius. Now, she can
look back and put blame where it is
deserved, she can tell where things went
wrong.

Her portrayal of Bergman is
fascinating: it is not a movie magazine
recollection; Ullman draws out her
impressions by his silent gestures, his
actions, as well as conversations.
Ullmann has a different perspective of
knowing Bergman intimately——both
professionally and personally—and she
makes good use of each side.

Ullmann recounts the making of
“Face to Face” in diary form and it is
especially engrossing. She relates how
she felt—-what went on in her head as the
picture was filmed, while the cameras
were running and behind the scenes. 2

Ullmann’s writing style is different for
an autobiography. She skips tense from
past to present. She relies heavily on
description and sentence fragments
rather than sentences and paragraphs.
At first this is acceptable, but becomes
contrived by the second chapter.

Generally, “Changing” is an honest
look at a remarkable woman and

probably the only autobiography by an
actress that is devoid of name dropping
and professional bragging.

“Changing” is much like the cover
photo of Liv Ullmann—sad, soulful,
poignant and beautifully mysterious. If
she could just learn to smile.

acoustic guitars strumming different
rhythmic patterns (typical of his

painstakingly detailed music), which-

lead into his angry, electric lead. His
retracked vocals on this one are kept low
and ominous on the scale and his lead
talks back to him after each line. An
excellent pick for AM or FM play.
“Nostradamus” closes the album off
in typical Moody Blties fashion, leaving
listeners a question to ponder.

Hayward’s ‘ pounding drum and

Fine Print
Pitt Still Recruiting;

Sherrill Wants You

 

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

Last year, in the middle of Pitt’s drive for college football supremacy, John
Majors inserted two plays——st'udent body red and student body green—into the
Panther game plan when he decided the “pride and enthusiasm" problem could be
solved b_y having students wave thousands of little cloth flags.

in exchange for participation, Majors offered “a good time on Saturday
afternoon.“

This year—even though the spring game had yet to be played and thus isn’t even
“This year" yet—Jackie Sherrill already has gone one up on Majors in the area of
student involvement and his indttcetnent is a free ride through school.

All you have to do to receive preferential invoice treatment is make the football
team. And, apparently, Sherrill isn't kidding when he tells Pitt students (high school
football players preferred) to come up to Pitt Stadium some afternoon to mix it up
with the national champs. ,

“We‘re very thin at sotne positions," said administrative assistant Larry Beilot,
who conferred with Sherrill and decided, hell, why not let the average 240—pound
chemical engineering major see what he could do about keeping Randy Holloway
out of Matt Cavanaugh‘s midsection.

That, it turns out, isn‘t such a bad example. “We’re particularly thin at line,’’
said Beilot. “Why, we don’t even have enough people on our line to have two
complete lines at practice. if any student thought he could help us out, we’d love to
have him." I I j

One reason for Pitt’s current personnel problem (it should be eased somewhat

when freshmen join the team for fall camp) is theirelatively recent batch of NCAA
scholarship limits that “really put a hindrance on football programs.”
“We have only 61 persons on scholarship right now,” said Beilot, who didn't count
the handful of redshirt holdovers from Majors’ first crop who aren’t affected by
limits placed after their enrollment. “That means that if a kid came out, made the
grade and proved some need, wecould give him a scholarship.”

If you ,aren’t big enough to even consider looking Matt Carroll (down to 250

pounds under the new coaching staff, by the way) in the eye, there’s still hope if

you’d like a shot at having Chris Schenkel tell the whole country your hometown.

“‘We're also very interested in a punter or a field goal kicker,” Beilot said.

A It’s Stetler Once Again

By JOHN FINN

Kathy Stetler repeated as a swimming
All—American for the second consecutive
year by finishing in the top I6 in two
events this weekend at the Association
for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
(AIAW) Nationals at Providence, Rhode

ln diving, Linda Hamner was the only
Pantherette to qualify for Nationals,
Hamner competed in the one-meter
diving.

The meet, which was won by Arizona,
was dominated by southern schools,
according to Stetler.

“The competition was tremendous in

Southern swimmers were the cream of
the crop.”

Most of the Pantherettes will be
relaxing briefly before they begin
workouts for yet another season, but for
Kathy Stetler, there is no rest, as she
begins to prepare for AAU Nationals

 

lsland.

Stetler, the only Pantherette to
swim in an individual event, placed llth
in both the I00-yard freestyle and the 5()-
yard butterfly to become an All-
American in two events.

“It really means a lot to become an
All-American," Stetler said. “but I wish
I would have done better in my other
events."

Stetler also participated in five other
events—two more individual events and
three relays.

“My times weren‘t that far off,"
Stetler claimed, “I guess I just didn't go
fast enough."

In addition to swimming the I00-yard
butterfly and the 50-yard freestyle,
Stetler participated in the 800- and 400-
yard freestyle relays and the 400-yard
medley relay.

Of the three relays, the team of
Christy Elston, Jamie Conley, Jennifer,  ,.
Price and Stetler faired the best in the pint
800-yard freestyle relay, finishing 18th,
just two places short of All-American
status.

While the other two relays didn’t fair
as well, both squads turned in their best
times of the year._ In the 400-yard
freestyle relay, it was the team of Diane
Kluglein, Elston, Price and Stetler that
represented the Pantherettes.
Meanwhile, Kluglein, Sue Guyer, Conley
and Stetler swam the 400-yard medley
relay for Pitt.

By PIXIE SOHN

Pitt has no one even close to an
assured position as punter or
placekicker, and this is getting_to be
about the time Sherrill will grow
desperate for kickers.

‘ " "He already is sufficiently concerned to"
take time for a trip to California in
search'of a punter. The placekicking

there is no one on the squad about whom
Sherrill wouldn't be anxious were there
extra points to be converted tomorrow.

\ .

Pitt is bringing in a couple of punters for a mutual look-see, one a junior college

kicker and the other a high-schooler_ somehow passed over in the recent recruiting
season.
“But we don’t have a punter yet,” said Beilot. “We’re looking around in various
places, but-it we could find a punter here, we’d make him a scholarship player.“
Some walk-ons already havea’ppeared at Pitt Stadium drills, Beilot said, “but it's
mostly running’ backs and receivers, and we have -plenty of them."

The call for extra help isn’t a knock at any current scholarship or walk-on players,

- Beilot said; it’s just a question of bodies. ’ .

And while chances of landing a scholarship spot on ’a major-college football
power are slim, it’s not impossible that a Pitt student responding to Sherrill’s call
will find himself doing more than serving as someone Elliott Walker can tramp over
in practice.

“lt’s an excellent opportunity,” said Beilot. “All someone has to do it contact
me at the football office. We’ll give him a physical and he’ll be’ out there ready to
go. Wefre really serious about this."

Coaches rant and rave about what hell recruiting is, but Sherrill and his staff

apparently can't get enough. They said’ he was a good recruiter, and this
idea—which could pay off._in talent, support and public relations with students—
proves it. Next, we can expect him to start recruiting alumni.

Buzz‘ Back in the News

After serving as Westminster Collegexalumni affairs director for two years, Pitt
basketball coach emeritus Charles “Buzz” Ridl has been appointed athletic director
at the school, effective July-l. ’ '

Ridl, coach when the I974 Panthers won a Pitt record 22 games in a row and
finished 25-4, also will serve'as a physical education professor and chairman of‘ the
department. Ridl retired from Pitt basketbal|’s head coaching position two seasons
ago. ~

It's a good thing Westminster has been stricken from the Panther schedttle—it
would be tough to root against Buzz Ridl. who accomplished a turnaround of
Majors proportions in his seven-year stay at Fitzgerald Field House.

Clancy & Co., Continued

Pitt recruiting attd the Roundball Classic have become intertwined lately in ways
good and bad. Sam Clancy has been selected to pla_v with teammate David Kennedy
on the Pennsylvania firststring, a team that will take on an Albert King—led squad of
Us. standouts. Gene Banks will also participate for the Pennsylvanians.

Clancy, who is said to have taken a liking to Carolina blue, especially that of the
sky above North Carolina State, would be Pitt's most sure recruit were it not for
Chris Dodds, a 30-point scorer from State College who should be a shot in Pitt's

Relations Ruin Wallace

By PATTY TASCARELLA

This is the first in a series of articles on the firing of Pat
Wallace, coach of the Pitt women's basketball team.

The prime reason a coach is canned is a losing record.
Ousted Pantherette mentor Pat Wallace, who led her squad
to an 18-7 season, said she was unjustly dumped for a

different cause—poor relationships with her team, staff and
administration.

Of team problems, Wallace said, “I
think this is probably true of most of the
teams in the country, including the
(National Basketball Association)
Philadelphia 76ers. You’ll have five
people who'd love to see the coach go,
five who’d hate it and five who don’t
care."

Wallace, who took over the head
coaching slot in 1975 upon the dismissal
of then-coach Jean Condo, admits she
walked into a difficult situation. The
team had to adjust to its new coach just
weeks before the season started-the
usual tension and conflicts multiplied
PATWALLACE during that sticky time—but the
Pantheretteswere able to put it all together for a successful
campaign.

“Sooner or later, the kids and you come to terms,"
Wallace stated. “The more they work with you, the better
they understand you. There's no way you can have
continuity if you keep changing the coach every year."

According to Wallace, she had asked to inform the team
herself that her contract would not be renewed, but her
request was denied by Director of Women's Athletics Sandy
Bulltnan. ) .

“I told them I would tell the girls,” Wallace recounted.
“They told me ‘No, we don't want any distortion'."

According to Pantherette forward MiMi Senkowski,
Bullman interrupted a practice session just prior to the team’s
trip to the regional playoffs at Lock Haven with the
announcement.

“I think it dcfinitel_v affected the way we played at the
Easterns,” Senkowski claimed just after Pitt was knocked
out of‘ the second rottnd competition by St. Joseph's. _

Wallace‘ said '7s.he7,was also _c_harg'e‘d__ by the Pitt»

 
 

S‘ iroris on the fire.”

  

administration with poor relations with opposing coaches.

“I never knew I had to have a warm relationship with
opposing coaches,” Wallace answered. She said the
opposing coaches at the regionals were “appalled by the
situation at Pitt. That was the talk at regionals and it did not
look good for Pitt’s reputation.

Wallace said charges that she did not get along with the
staff and parents of her athletes were unfounded, that there
were no unpleasant incidents with the staff at Fitzgerald Field
House and that she had instituted “Parent’s Weekend.”

“They (the athletic administration) should start by telling a
coach everything ahead of time," Wallace insisted, “like if
Sandy Bullman wants to still coach the basketball team.”

Bullman had served as Pantherette basketball coach prior
to Wallace and Condo. Even after her promotion, Wallace
accused Bullman of continuing to meddle with the
Pantherette hoopsters.

“Some people find it very difficult to give up coaching,”
Wallace said. “l think it’s a personal thing Sandy will have
to work out herself.“

According to Wallace, after the '75-'76 season, Bullman
agreed that if a complaint should arise, there would be a three
way meeting between the player, Bullman and Wallace. This
was not carried out.

“In January, Sandy told me that none of the girls had been
up to see her. She said she was sure that I told them not to
and that was not the truth," Wallace said. ’

Wallace also ela'imed that after the I975-76 season,
Bullman told her she would have “three years to reach
national recognition.“

“I always thought somebody’s/wordwas good. They’ve
got to stop pulling verbal promises. I have three years left in
the doctoral program at Pitt and now I’m left hanging
there——doctoral credits are nontransferrable,” Wallace said.

Wallace said her dismissal had nothing to do with the
supposition that a winning coach will demand more money at
contract time. '

“I don’t think she considered that," Wallace said.

“To tell the truth, I feel a sense of relief. Working with
Sandy was a threat,” she admitted. “I definitely don’t know
what they wanted. Certainly, the criteria they gave me would
doubly apply to Tim Grgurich." ,-

Bailey, 190 pounds, was defeated 4-1
in the first round by Bill King of,
Alabama.

The heavyweight, Stepanovich, faced
a giant of a wrestler, Jim Mitchell from

, Arizona, in the first round. According

to Adams, the six-foot, 400-pound
Mitchell was “huge, quick and could
move.” Despite the odds, it was a 4-3
win for -Stepanovich. When he faced
George Moscowitz from the University
of California at jﬁerkeley in the next

Stepanovich would have been back for
the consolation matches. Their
opponents all won, however, and Pitt
was finished for this year’s competition.

There was something the Panthers
learned aside from new techniques of
one-on-one wrestling competition. They
saw what fan support and enthusiasm
can do for a team. The top
winners—1owa State, Oklahoma and
lowa— each had over 1,000 fans in
attendance.

“The enthusiasm was fantastic,”
Adams marveled. “The Iowa State fans
shook pom-poms, Oklahoma fans
waved orange handkerchieves and the
Iowa fans hung banners. As eight
matches went on at once, the fans
cheered for all of their wrestlers and

Even though the season is officially
over, Pitt wrestling will go on. The
squad will be working out several nights

competing on their own in non-weight
level summer tournaments. There is
much room for improvement next year,

but Adams is pleased with the prospects.
“Everyone will be back except Milt
Schuler and Gregg Soergel,” Adams
claimed, “and we have some good
recruit contacts. Overall, we promise to
be extremely competitive next season.
Our goal is to be among the top five in
the country. With our experienced
young wrestlers, good recruiting and
student support, we should be there.”

Black Hawks End Streak
With Win Over Pens, 3-2

CHICAGO (AP)—Grant Mulvey
escaped a crowd at his own blue line and
skated around Rick Kehoe to score at
7:04 of the third period Sunday night
and give the Chicago Black Hawks a 3-2
National Hockey League victory over
the Pittsburgh Penguins.

The triumph was the Hawks’ first
since Feb. 26 and snapped their nine-
game winless streak. They had lost eight
in a row before tying the New York
islanders Saturday night.

The Penguins lost for the fourth time.

in their last five outings but remained in
second place in the Norris Division,
three points ahead of idle Los Angeles.

Mulvey’s goal, his ninth of the year,
came after Pittsburgh tied the score in
the second peliod on goals by Bob Kelly
and Mario Faubert.

Chicago defenseman Phil Russell
uncorked a 45-footer midway in the first
period to give the Hawks a l—() lead.
With a power—p|ay advantage. lvan
Boldirev scored his 24th goal of the
season on a rebound giving the Hawks a
2-0 lead at 5:25 of the second period.
Mulyey assisted. It was Chicago‘s 54th
power—play goal of the season.

But Kelly went between Hawks’
defensemen Randy Holt and Russell to
score his 10th goal of the year with 13:46
gone in the middle period. Then Faubert
danced his way to the goal without a
Hawk touching him and beat Tony
Esposito at the 19:26 mark as the Hawk
goalie slid to his knees. It was only

l"aubert’s fourth goal in three years of

nhl competition and his second of the
season.

- Michigan, an overwhelming favorite
to advance to the final four, couldn’t
decide what to make of NC-Charlotte in
general and Maxwell in particular.

“That was the 0nl_v team I ever saw

NC-Charlotte built a 40-27 lead at the

Michigan press in the second half. then
pulled away for good with about five
minutes left. Lew Massey h.it two free
throws to put the 49ers on top 65—6l. Mel
Watkins sank a layup, Maxwell

Kinch followed with a layup and two

Maxwell wound up with 25 points and

with 2().

“This is an unbelievable experience,"

the play of reserve Bernard Toone.
Toone came off the bench with about I6
