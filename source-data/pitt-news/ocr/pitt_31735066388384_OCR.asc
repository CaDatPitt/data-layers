Coping on Campus...

Graduation losses a part of continued growth

The academic year is almost
over, possibly bringing with it
mixed feelings of accomplishment
and loss. While it’s a happy time
of year, it is also a time for saying

goodbye to people and things

familiar.

This can be problematic for
some students. It is a particularly
poignant. time for seniors, but
other students may also feel a
little emotionally unsettled.

These feelings of uneasiness
are normal and predictable. The
end of a school year is a time of

. transition, and such times tend to

elicit complex emotions in all of
us.» _

It is a time of both anticipation
and loss. There is loss of routine,
old friends and support networks.
For seniors, there is the loss of a
college-student identity that has
provided a certain feeling of
stability for the last few years.

Transitional periods may also

   

S/D1}. Robért
Gallagher

touch off hidden emotions. Every
step of our growth process, from
infancy to the present,_ has
involved letting earlier
attachments go.

This letting go almost always
involves anxiety. ‘

Some transitions, of course, are

more significant than others.
Leaving the womb, entering
school for the first time and losing
the first love are a few critical
ones.

Some of these transitions may
have left some emotional scars,
Consequently, whenever we
encounter a new transitional
period, we need to deal with the
anxiety that may arise from these
old memories.

The uneasiness or mild feeling
of depression that may occur at
these times usually passes once
we get involved in new activities.
It’s a good idea, however, to
acknowledge our present losses
and do a little thinking about past
losses as well. 2

Such activity helps us.to make
sense of at least some of our
confused feelings at this time of
yeah

The good news in all of this is
that the losses we have

experienced in the past and may
be experiencing now are a
necessary‘ part of continued
growth. As Judith Viorst states in
her book Necessary Losses, “The
road to human development is
paved with renunciation.”

We grow throughout our lives
by giving up some of our deepest
attachments. In confronting these
losses we present ourselves with
opportunities for new growth.

Viorst also tells us that we
cannot love deeply without
becoming vulnerable to loss, and
“we cannot become separate
people, responsible people,
connected people, without some
losing and letting go.”

So take the time -you need to
mourn your losses. Then draw
strength from what has gone
before, and use it to help you
make the most of the
opportunities that lie ahead.

BiGALA laopes to educate students about ROTCpolz'cz'es   

By Lane Hornfeck
Stajf Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance is beginning a campaign
to educate incoming and current
students about discrimination in
the U.S. military and the ROTC.

Military policy currently
excludes homosexuals.

According to Melissa Smith, co-
president of BiGALA, Pitt’s
Reserve Officers Training Corps
does not inform students Of this
policy when offering scholarships
and entrance to military~science
courses.

“.What we would like to do is
send information along with the
letters sent by the ROTC to the
incoming freshmen that tells
about the pOlicy,”’said Smith.

This means that the ROTC has
the authority to deny students
access to the program, force them
to repay their scholarships and
eventually dismiss them from the
program if they later admit to
being bisexual, gay or lesbian or

did not make a decision about
their sexuality until after they
were fully involved in the
program, according to Smith.
The rnilitary’s policy excluding
homosexuals began in January
1943, when the Department Of
Defense published Directive
1332.14. The directive states that
“homosexuality is incompatible
with military service. The
presence in the military
environment of persons who

engage in homosexual conduct \

Or who, by their statements,
demonstrate a propensity to
engage in homosexual conduct,

In October 1990, James
Holobaugh, a former Army ROTC
cadet, came to Pitt to speak about
how he had been dismissed from
the ROTC because he admitted
he was gay. He was asked to pay
back the $25,000 scholarship he
received from the ROTC program
at Washington University in St.

By Tammy R. Poole
sum‘ Wﬁter

8 _The Black Action Society's
incoming chairperson was

' recently awarded first place in an

‘area of the national American
College Theatre festival.

“I entered in the Lorraine
Hansberry playwriting contest,
which was part of the American
College Theatre festival and year-
long contests that they have in
different areas. Students from all
around the country submit their
plays to these different areas of
the festival,” said Marta Effinger,
whose winning play is "entitled
‘Union Station. “The one area of
the festival that was going to be
in Washington,. D.C., at the
Kennedy Center was the Lorraine
Hansberry playwriting contest,
and I won first place for this
area.”

Effinger, who is known around
the University of Pittsburgh
campus for her short stories and

A ’ poems, said she wrote the play to

try something different.

“I thought that this was the
next step,” Effinger said.

Although this may have been
Effinger’s next step, it is definitely
not her last. The play will be
brought to the stage next year
and performed in Pitt’s Stephen
Foster Memorial Theatre.
Auditions for students were held
Sunday from 3 to 5 p.m., and will
be held again today from 8 to 10
p.m. at 3814 Forbes Ave. Auditions -
for people in the Pittsburgh
community will be held at a later
date.

“We were going to do the play
next year whether it had won or
not. I had just found out a couple
of weeks ago that I had won, and
it just so happened that around
the time we wanted to do it, it
had won,” said Effinger.

Effinger said actors and
actresses interested in auditioning
for her play should possess a
specific type of energy in order to
bring out the realism in her
characters. Because Union
Station deals with several
emotions, the. play requires

diverse acting techniques, she
said. ~
“I believe thatl don’t have ﬂat
characters. Now, if you have a
strong character, a strong actor
needs to go along with that. This
is a drama, and it’s serious, but
there are‘ some soft moments in
there, and some funny moments
in there between everyone.
There's a lot of conﬂict and tension
also, so I want an actor to feed off
of all of those elements,” said
Efﬁnger.

“I don’t want them to just be

able to do a serious part and '

they're terrible in_the funny part
and vice versa. I want an actor or
actress who is versatile, who can
lend to the ensemble, not as just
one actor here, one actor there.
Someone who can work with
others and can act on ensemble,”
she said.

Those auditioning for roles in
Union Station will read from
pieces of the play as well as

participate in improvisations,.

exercises and monologue
readings that he or she brings to

the audition.

According to Andrea Oakley-
McNeil], a,—,senior and member of
the Kuntu Repertory Theatre who
read Effinger’s complete
manuscript, versatile acting is a
definite plus in this play because
the characters are so well—written
and developed. .

She could not believe the talent
that Effinger displayed through
the work.

“I was surprised. I read a
number of her poems  and she
is very talented. After reading this
play, I think I must have asked
her about 50 times how old she
was when she wrote this because
I couldn’t believe that something
this‘ developed and something
this close to people's lives could
come from such a young woman, ”
said Oakley—McNeill. “When the
public sees the play, they'll know
what I mean as far as I couldn’t
believe her talent.”

Union Station takes place in
1978 in Washington, D.C. It looks
at two non-biological families

;Play written by BAS chair wins national award

resources, both emotional and

financial, in order to create a one-
family unit.

“So you have one family here,
as the husband, the wife and
their children, and you have the
other family: an older woman,
45, and her father. As these two
families come together, the play
looks at the conﬂicts and shows
how they overcome a lot of
problems that a family has to deal
with," said Effinger.

The people, places and things
of Effinger’s past and present

have all influenced the
development of the characters of
the play.

“I wanted to, take pieces of my
community, pieces of my family,
things that I had experienced and
things that I just wanted to make
up and put it on stage. That was
one of the things that inﬂuenced
me: ‘my family,” said Effinger.

Vernell Lillie, associate
professor of the black studies

department, and the Kuntu

Repertory Theatre, of which
Effinger is a member, have also
been inﬂuences.

“Lillie had a lot of inﬂuence on
me,” said Effinger. “I was really
frustrated because it took a lot
out of me to write a full-length
play, and she kept pushing me
and trying to encourage me and
telling me to do it —— you know,
making me rewrite it over and
over again.

“I’m a part of Kuntu Repertory
Theatre, and they had an inﬂuence
on me also. They have always
encouraged my writing and given
me that extra push and drive,”
she said. “I guess they believed in
me sometimes more than I
believed in myself, but that helps

me to keep going and altogether ‘

helped me to finish the play."
Oakley-McNeill is unsure if she
will audition for one of the roles
in the play, but she said helping
out in any way with the
production will be a worthwhile
experience in itself.
“Just to be involved with it is
great because I think it is such a
wonderful play. She's such a gifted
and talented writer that it should
be seen, and it should be out for
everyone  before it hits
Broadway,” said Oakley-McNeill..
“There is so much warmth and
depth in it that you just have to
see it to believe it.”

Then-undergraduate president
Dean Florez repeatedly said that
the practice was unethical.

“Basically it is very unethical
that someone can allocate
themselves money out of a
contingency fund when faculty
themselves must apply to other
places for research funds,” Florez
said. Florez called for an
investigation into Orbach’s
performance, a request which
was denied by the UCLA
Academic Senate.

Last April, the College of Arts,
and Sciences found itself with a
$700,000 deﬁcit after Orbach hired
more faculty members than was
planned. '

According to current
undergraduate president Dean
_Poulakidas, the surplus of faculty
Orbach_ hired were “research

faculty.”
The deﬁcit forced “sweeping
cuts in the number of

undergraduate classes,” according
to The Bruin. Especially hard hit
were the math, English and
anthropology departments.

The overhiring prompted _

Academic Affairs Commissioner

. Florie Aranovich to sponsor a
, second student resolution calling

for an investigation of Orbach’s
performance, which was also
denied.

Allegations were also made by

‘Aranovich about Orbach’s

behavior on the executive
committee, which is a body that
approves major academic
decisions. Both Aranovich and
Orbach sit on the executive’
committee. Aranovich said that
Orbach used his power to
“intimidate” faculty on the
committee.

“Raymond »Orbach has
repeatedly conducted the
governance of the college and
the business of the executive
committee in aysecretive,
undemocratic manner and has
used his position to intimidate
faculty and students into
acquiescence," she said.

years later, Jones said she’s glad
that the searchfor her successor
is almost over.

“Weneed a full—time director,"
she said. “I had been here 20
years as a professor. We hear all
kinds of grievances, serve on
committees and educate the
university community. It just takes
a lot of energy.”

Jones added that although Pitt’s
Office of Affirmative Action does
an adequate job, there’s always
room for improvement.

“We haven’t done as good of a

0 job as we would have liked to.

[Pitt’s] a great place for people
from western Pennsylvania to get
an education,” she said, “but the
university has to do a better job at
outreaching.

“People have to know that
people here will want to see
them and make accommodations
for them. It doesn’t matter if
they’re black, women, Vietnam
veterans or what their sexual
preference is.”

an article that investigated a
“legally sound but ethically
questionable” practice at UCLA
in which Orbach was involved.
According to 7726 Bruin, UCLA
officials took state funds designed
to improve student instruction
and spent most of the moneylto
recruitresearch faculty. From 1986

to 1990, $10 million of a $154

million allocation was taken out
of the “Instructional Equipment
Fund” and diverted toward
recruitment. '

At that time Orbach said he had -

suggested that money from the
Instructional Fund be used for
recruitment, but that the final
decision had been up to UCLA
Chancellor Charles Young.

At yesterday’s meeting of the
Student Affairs Advisory Council,
presidential—search committee
member Lisa" Campoli asked
Orbach to respond to the
controversies.

“There is a large issue that I am
in favor of research, research,

research but not in terms of
teaching, and that is. just dead
wrong. I don’t know how to deal
with it except to say that I have
done everything in my power to
improve the quality of the
instructional program,” Orbach
said.

Orbach tied research and
teaching together.

“My personal belief is that the
people who generate the ideas
have to be the ones who teach
them to the students. That is, if
you hear a new idea .or a new
concept in class, you should hear
it from the person who has created
that idea or that concept. That is
what I mean by education,”
Orbach said.

“I think the quality of instruction
at UCLA has improved
immeasurably because the quality
of the dedicated faculty has
improved,” Orbach said. “Not
everybody understands the cost
of bringing together a superb
teaching faculty.”

There are many who feel that
the investment is for research
rather than for teaching, Orbach
said.

But “in order to hire faculty in
this day and age, you have to give
them the ability to teach and to
do research,” Orbach said. ‘‘I can
be criticized for hiring faculty
who are very strong in their
research, but I accept the
criticism.”

In regard to the deficit because
of overhiring in the College of
Letters and Sciences, Orbach
called the situation “incredible
good fortune” that UCLA was
able to attract that many
professors.

Of the 60 faculty members that
were hired that year, 31 percent
were underrepresented
minorities, 33 percent were
women and 49 percent were
Caucasian males, Orbach said.

history of the college the

have a voting student member on

“I believe that students should
have a right to vote on

The University of Pittsburgh presidential-search committee
will meet today to narrow the number of finalists to three,
according to chairperson Farrell Rubenstein.

“We will deliver those to the chairmen. lt»’s' their responsibility
to reduce it to one recommendation to the full board, and I
would say that process should be a matter of some few weeks,”
Rubenstein said.

Over the past two weeks, members from all parts of the
university community have had the opportunity to meet and

Eastern
European
changes
analyzed

By Andrew S. Bruno
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The economic development of
Eastern Europe over the past five
years was" examined by a
Hungarian professor at a lecture
in Forbes Quadrangle yesterday.

The Center for Russian and
East European Studies sponsored
the colloquium on “Nation,
Regionalism and Integration in
Eastern Europe.”

The talk was given by Ferenc

Gazdag of Lorand Eotvosn

University in Budapest. He said
that an analysis of the
development in Eastern Europe
over the past five years is
important because 'of the

unprecedented changes which‘

have taken place.

Gazda g said the recent changes
in Eastern Europe are unique for
two reasons: “the timing and the
lack of violence.”

He said thatwhile most theorists
were worried about the spread

‘ of communism, Eastern European

leaders were planning market
economies and multi—party

systems.

The‘ changes which have
recently come about have been

“I never, in any way try to say I
am associated with the university.
I don’t want to be,”§aid Bonasorte.
The university said the lawsuit
came into existence because
Bonasorte illegally uses the word
“Pitt” in his phone number.
Bonasorte disagreed, saying that
he is merely taking the first four
letters from the name of his
vending operation, which is called
The Pittsburgh Shop.
‘ “I am taking the first part of my

_ [business] name for the phone

number, and it is a coincidence
that it happens to spell Pitt,” said
Bonasorte.

Bonasorte said that there are
numerous companies around
Pittsburgh that use the letters “P-
i-t-t” in their advertisements.

“I don’t think the [university]
owns the name ‘Pi.tt,”’ said
Bonasorte.

Bonasorte has already changed
the name _ of his vending
operation, which was previously
called The Pitt Stop. “The
[university] was not allowing me
to use that name, sol agreed with
them and changed it to The
Pittsburgh Shop,” said Bonasorte.

Bonasorte said that he was
ready to drop the phone number
from his van but did not feel that
he owed Pitt any money. “I was
ready to drop the [phone number],
but Pitt won’t let me,” said
Bonasorte.  I

“[In order to Fight the university
in court] it will cost me legal fees
also,” said‘Bonasorte. “I’m giving
in against my betterjudgment
and agreeing to drop the phone
number, but I am not going to

pay [the university] any money.” -

T I Tight funding for education “ j

The federal government, under the so-called “Education
President,” does not seem to have educationon its list of
priorities for funding. .

The City University of New York has been suffering
from harsh economic difficulties. The state of New York
cut its budget by approximately $92 million earlier this
year. This is an immense cut in any budget, butit‘ staggers
this school, which must educate some 200,000 students.

In an attempt to offset this deficit, the university decided
to increase tuition by $500. This is the second tuition

, increase in as many semesters, as tuition went up by $200
‘last term. In the past year, then,’ tuition at the City

University of New York has increased by 56 percent. In
comparison, Pitt’_s tuition normally does not rise more
than 10 percent annually. -

Many of the students attending this university can
barely manage. to pay the $1,250 tuition, and it may
eventually take some students up to eight years to
graduate with a degree. This increase will mean that
many will not be graduating, and fewer students will be
able to attend school.

Students, therefore, have rebelled against the school.

’ .- Theyhave set up barricades in front of university-owned

buildings to prevent classes from being held. Thirty-.
seven students» were suspendedfor disrupting class
schedules’. - '

The university, however, will not budge.‘ In fact,
prospective students will not only have to face higher

tuition but also tougher admission standards aspwell. ‘

Since the school cannot handle the students it already

I has, it cannot take many more without getting something

in return — namely, students who will be more likely to

,3; graduate. .

This only completes a vicious cycle that constantly runs
in higher education. Universities have their funds cut by
state and federal governments, so in turn they must raise
tuition. Less people are therefore able to attend, decreasing
the university’s‘need for as much money. In short, less
people who need an education can afford the costs.

In the case of the New York school, ‘however, they are
looking to the wrong place. Students do not have the V
money. The federal government, however, does; at least,

it has better access to funds.

The Bush administration has prided itself on being
involved with the education of our youth. Somewhere in

‘t the multibillion-dollar budget, the government of this

country should be able to scrapeup some funds to keep
the costs of education down. ,

The people of this country have the right to an
education. Without funding from the federal government,
however, many prospective students will find a restriction

in those rights because of the almighty dollar.

Humorist leaves dull campus

Well, another semester has.

passed us by. We’ve seen the
trouncing of the Iraqis by the
allies, the pummelling of the
Kurds by the Iraqis, the thrashing
of the Pirates by the Cincinnati
Reds and the shellacking of the

Oakland A’s, also courtesy o’ the

Reds. Whew, what a violent past
couple of months. It’s no wonder

everyone around here has been

so gloomy. .

I still say the University of
Pittsburgh suffers a real crisis in
humor. like measles, though, this
condition is not incurable. I think
that next year this campus could
become‘ a hot spot for laughs, if
things are handled correctly.
Already things have gotten off to
a good start.

For example, take Pitt football.
After printing a bunch of "100
Years of Football” shirts, the team
played this past season like
they’ve been around for only
one. I wouldn’t expect a national
championship this. year. Maybe
they can book a good act for the
halftime show.

On the administrative end of
things, I think our new president
has a" great potential for bringing
lightheadedness er,
lightheartedness — to Pitt. With
potential candidates having
names like Orbach, Hess and

Gershon Vincow, how could you .2

go wrong? Just to be on the safe
side, I think the presidential-
search committee should ﬁnd out
if any of the candidates have
stand-up experience.

The SGB saw to our humor
needs at the beginning of the
year by giving us Telefact. Don't
get me wrong, though. I do find
a telephone trivia service very
useful — where else can you find
out thatAlbrightCo1lege’s mascot
is the owl?

Personally, I wouldn’t want to
play any of those Telefact
operators at Trivial Pursuit. I’ll

  Adam ,
Richter i

bet they could putAlex_ Trebek to
shame.

On the national scene, you can
always rely on good ol’ Donnie

' Wahlberg to provide some laughs.

First the guy lets his hair grow

and stops shaving. (I'll bet it took _

him a year to get that stubble.)
Now, as if that’s not enough, he
decides to set fire to a rug in an
Atlanta ’ hotel. Wow. I’m

‘impressed. Boy, that Donnie kid

is one tough little guy.

Come on. The worst‘ thing
Donnie could do to a hotel is
perform in its lounge. 'Let’s face it;
what he did is still nothing
compared to the late Keith Moon’s
escapades, even on a quiet night.
Call me crazy, butl can’t compare
driving a Mercedes into a pool
(Keith Moon did this in the early
1970s) to setting fire to a rug. I
have to give him credit, though.
Wahlberg is certainly contributing
to the humor this campus needs.

I can defmitely see this campus
police thing’ turning into a big
brouhaha. In a morbid, Kafka-
esque kind of way, I’ll be pretty
glad about it, too. About a month
ago, when everyone realized that
The Pitt News and. the
Department of Public Safety had
beaten, mauled, folded, spindled,
mutilated, crucified, shot and
decapitated this dead horse, I
feared that the whole issue was
pretty much done for.

But I'm sure both sides are
simply resting in their corners.
When they come out, all of us
with ringside seats will get to see
a fight not unlike a Tyson-

Holyﬁeld ﬁght. The punches (and.

hopefully the laughs) will really
ﬂy then.
I could be wrong, though.
Even if the campus police can’t

be relied on to provide usall with .

a good yuk here and there, there’s
always the Students for Peace.
Last year members of the Students

. for Peace gave this campus such

entertainment as marching against
the war in El Salvador (this was in

December and January, by the

way) and holding anti-Desert

Storm marches (eventually, they

got it right) from the Software

Engineering Institute building to
the William Pitt Union. I wonder
how they could stand to walk
that far.

With such classic performances .

like those under its belts, I’m sure
the PSfP (or whatever the acronym
of the day will be) can make this
a funnier campus for all of us.
Maybe it should work together
with Donnie Wahlberg.
Naturally, I have done
something myself to help solve
this problem of no humor at Pitt.
Now available at Kinko’s is Ten
on the Richter Scale, a book of
Top 10 lists a la David Letterman’
(it’s all original, though) that I
wrote over the past year. Most of
them poke fun at Pitt and news
events that took place over the
past year, with a few general
topics thrown in (like “Top 10
reasons hockey is better than
basketball,” or “Top 10 little-
known facts about
Thanksgiving”). You can find it
listed under “Richter” in the
professor publishing guide. The
book costs $4.50 and has to be
pre—ordered. Now if that’s not a

shameless plug, I don't know’

what is.

Well, folks, that’s that. I'm gone ' .

until August, off to a place that’s
even more of a humor wasteland
than Pitt: Reading, Pa. The only
humor to be found in Reading
consists of a Reading Phillies
minor-league ball game.

Despite a valiant comeback in
the bottom of the ninth inning,
the Pantherbaseball team lost a
hard-fought game to the Seton
Hall Pirates 8-7 on Monday at
Trees Field, dropping to 12-21
overall and 1-10 in the Big East.

The planned doubleheader
turned into a single game when

' the teams met at noon and found

the ﬁeld resembling a swimming
“pool more than a baseball
diamond. The past days’ rains
had drenched the ﬁeld, and the
players doubled as the ﬁeld crew

' for approximately three hours

trying to get the ﬁeld into shape.
Panther pitcher Des Schnur
in an exceptional

strikeouts and getting the out at

‘just the right time, but a bad
display of Panther defense (giving
up four errors) ‘kept Schnur from
getting the win.‘

Nipped: 

Panthers come up short in B

Seton Hall got off to an early
lead when, in the first inning, the
Panthers made two crucial errors,
allowing the Pirates to score three
runs. Those errors were factors
when it came down to the ﬁnal
inning.

The Panthers scored in the
second inning, when Ralph
McNelly walked, Blaine Vucci
cranked a hard single up the
middle and Brad Reese‘ also
walked. With the bases loaded,
Greg Christman hit a sacriﬁce fly
to deep center, allowing McNelly
to score. Immediately after, Reese
was picked off while trying to
steal second, but Vucci scored in
the process.

After the Pirates scored four
more runs, making the score 6-2,
the‘ Panthers got two more runs
of their own, cutting Seton Hall’s
lead to 6-4. The runs developed
when Bill Sherbondy nailed a
two-out double, sending home
Bryan Henne and Greg Trimbur.

Pitt rowing picks up gold in season-openingregattas

Rowing in the _women’s open fours

By John Labriola
saw Writer

The Pitt crew team kicked off its spring

season by competing in both the Notre

Dame Crew Classic last weekend and at
the second annual Johns Hopkins
Invitational Regatta in the Inner Harbor at
Baltimore, Md., two weekends ago.

The weather in Indiana was not the

I most conducive for rowing, but the

Panthers were able to place every one of
their boats into the finals. Pitt had a total
of eight boats entered in the competition
with six of them taking medals.

The crew team started off the final
round of competition with women’s
lightweight fours. The Lady Panthers took
the silver medal in the event with a time of
7 minutes and 3.69 seconds, behind
Michigan State. J

Rowing in the women’s lightweight
varsity fours were (from stroke) Luann

Rosa, Gina Camillo, Lori Shofran, Trish
Cloonan and coxswain Leslie Burchett.

In the second event, the Panthers took
the bronze medal in the men’s lightweight
fours, coming in 15 seconds behind MSU
and 20 seconds behind Notre Dame.

Rowing in the men’s lightweight varsity
fours were (from stroke) Bob Falk, Ross
Kiliany, Jeff Dahl, Graham Turnbull and
coxswain Maria DePasquale. J

The next event, the men’s novice fours,
pitted the Panthers against Loyola
University and MSU. The Pitt crews took
third and fourth places.

Rowing in Pitt’s bronze-medal boat were
(from stroke) Mike Yontz, Chuck
Petersheirn, Burt Losken, Paul Shiley and
coxswain George Collins. '

In Pitt’s fourth-place novice boat were
(from stroke) Chad Galbraith, Gray
Mazzotta, Scott Eichelsdorfer, Kevin
Kannon and coxswain Mike Winter.

One of the biggest highlights of the

competition came during the women’s
novice fours event. The Lady Panthers
were able to not only capture first place
but also to take second,

Rowing in Pitt’s gold-medal boat with a
time of 7: 17:00 were (from stroke) Andrea
Zicherman, Missy Miller, DanaJaros, Stacy
Browning and coxswain Lori Gassner.

Pitt’s silver-medalboat was rowedby
(from stroke) Annette Romeo, Barbara
Purcell, Vallary Baker, Marcy McCurdy
and coxswain Janinne Markizon.

In the men’s heavyweight fours event,
Pitt took the silver medal, coming in
behind the University of Michigan.

Rowing in the men’s heavyweight fours
were (from stroke) Todd Ridenour, John
Evers, Matt Prechtel, Pete Alpern and
coxswain Leanna Hopkins. ‘

The ﬁnal event for the crew team was
the women’s open fours. The Lady Panthers
ﬂoated across the ﬁnish line in sixth place
with a time of 7:41:00.

event were (from stroke) Julie Norris,
Mariah Creech, Debbie Yorinks, Amy Meier
and coxswain Bufﬁe Hallcom.

Two‘ weeks ago the Panthers took
advantage of the warm weather to place
six boats» into the ﬁnals of the JHU
Invitational: one boat in the men’s varsity
fours division, two boats in the men’s
lightweight varsity fours division, one boat

in the women’s lightweight varsity fours

division, and two boats in the women’s
open varsity fours division.

During the course of the day there were
33 races run, 12 of which were ﬁnal runs.
The ﬁrst two ﬁnishers in races with two
heats advanced to the finals, while the ﬁrst
two ﬁnishers and the next fastest time in
races with three heats advanced to the
ﬁnals.

High school stars sbme in Dapper Dom Roundball C’lassz'c

By Derek Willis
Sta1fIVriter

It only took_four seconds from
the opening tap of the Dapper
Dan Roundball Classic for Thomas
Burrough of the U.S. East All-
Stars to throw down the ﬁrst
dunk.

Twenty-six dunks later,
Burrough and his teammates
came up on the short end of a
104-103 score in the 27th edition
of the Roundball, played Sunday
at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena.

Glenn Robinson, most valuable
player for the West, scored 19
points, and Jalen Rose poured in
16 second—half points in keying
the West win. The East's Chris
Webber led all scorers with 22.

The game was a showcase for
some of the premiere high-school
basketball talent in the nation,

including four players who will
continue their basketball careers
at the University of Michigan:
Rose, Webber, Jimmy King, and
Juwan Howard. King and Howard
played for the West team Sunday.

The West held seven-point lead
at halftime and opened up 18-
and 19-point leads in the third
and fourth quarters. But the East
staged a furious comeback,
sparked by Webber and point
guard Cory Alexander.

Trailing by 19 with eight
minutes remaining in the game,
the 6-foot-10-inch Webber
rammed home three straight
dunks, leading the East on a 14-
0 run. Webber ﬁnished the game
with eight slams, including two
alley-oops and two reverses. “He
was a man out there," said East
Coach Steve Smith. “He didn't
rebound as well as he did in the

other [All-Star] games he has
played in, but some of the things
he did were unbelievable.”

The West team managed to
hang on, however, relying on
strong inside play and clutch free-
throw shooting. Georgia Tech
signee James Forrest and
Robinson, who is bound for
Purdue, paced the interior play.

Other players who contributed
were Danny Hurley, the brother
of Duke’s point guard Bobby
Hurley, with eight for the East
and 5-foot-7nches Calvin Rayford,
who amazed the crowd with his
speed and hand quickness.
Rayford, who signed with Kansas,
ﬁnished with six points, four
assists and five steals. “He's
quicker than quick," said Smith.

Alexander, who hasn’t decided
on a college yet, led the East
squad with seven assists and also

contributed 19 points. He is
expected to choose between the
University of Michigan and the
University of Virginia. “I think
he ’ll probably sign with Virginia,”
said Smith, who coached
Alexander at Oak Hill‘ Academy
in Virginia. “His roommate,
Thomas Burrough, signed with
Virginia in the fall, so they've
basically had an in-house recruiter
all year.”

Four Pennsylvania players
participated in the Roundball,
including locals Will Macon and
Malik Hightower, both from Perry
Traditional Academy. Macon
scored 11 points for the East,
while Hightower took home the
dunk-competition crown. The
other in-state players were
Bernard Jones and Kareem
Townes, both from Philadelphia.

Pitt recruit Orlando Antigua

received a warm welcome from
the crowd. The 6-6 forward played
16 minutes for the East, chipping
in six points, six rebounds and
four blocked shots. “It felt really
good to play here in Pittsburgh,”
said Antigua, “but I felt I could
have played a lot better."

Smith said that while Antigua
played aggressively, he seemed
nervous and tried to force things.
But Smith added that his versatility
would make him a very good
player in college.

Among the college coaches in
attendance at the arena were
Bobby Crernins (Georgia Tech),
Clem Haskins (Minnesota), Joey
Meyer (DePaul), P.J. Carlesimo
(Seton Hall) and Dale Brown
(Louisiana State University).

.-.Question mark remains at tailback spot afterspring crills

By Rob Pugliese
Staﬂ" Writer

The tailback position has been
a tower of strength for Pitt football
ever since the days when a man
named Tony Dorsett toted the
pigskin. Players such as Elliot
Walker, Bryan Thomas, Charles
Gladman, Craig Heyward and
most ‘recently Curvin Richards
have continued Dorsett’s tradition
of 1,000—yard seasons.

5*‘ The 1991 Panthers concluded

spring drills still searching for the
successor to Richards, who
decided to forfeit his final season
of eligibility and enter this
Sunday’s NFL draft. Gone are his
3,192 career rushing yards, 20
touchdowns and 14 performances
of 100 yards or more.

The coaching staff feels strongly
that there won’t be one man
filling the tailback slot. Instead
there will be a combination of

(‘three or four quality backs.

In the bottom of the ninth, with
the ‘score 8-4 and one out,
Sherbondy was hit by a pitch,
and McNelly reached on a single.
The next batter, Jerry Berteotti,
hit a double, sending home
Sherbondy; following this, Reese
sent McNelly home on a single.
The next run, the last one of the
day, was scored when Greg
Christrnan sent. Berteotti home

J_'»;"witl1 a single. The next two batters

popped out and grounded out to
end all hopes of a major comeback
for the Panthers. _

PITI‘ BITS: Some good hitting
was turned in by the Panthers:
Reese was three for four with
three singles; Vucci was two for
two with two singles; Berteotti
was two for two with a double
and single. The Panthers’ next
home game is on Thursday, April

18 against Clarion at 3 p.m. at

Pennsylvania faced off as the
City/West Penn All-Stars beat the
Western Pennsylvania Interscho-

99. The backcourt duo of Samba
Johnson (Schenley High School)
and Fred Johnson (Hickory High
School) were the fuel for the C/
,WP team. Sambajohnson took
MVP honors, scoring 14 points to
go along with eight rebounds

and four steals, while Fred

Johnson added 14 points.

Ralph Blundo (New Castle High
School) led the WPIAL team with
19 points and also captured his
team’s MVP award. C/WP’s Bruce
Patterson (Langley High School)
led all players with 21 points and
13 rebounds in just 16 minutes of
play. .

“We have a lot of different
types of guys: outside ‘runners,
inside runners, finesse, open-ﬁeld
runners. We're going to ﬁt runners
into situations based on their
strengths,” said running-backs
coach Skip Peete. “Whoever has
the best camp will be the starter.”

Head coach Paul Hackett said

( that there will be a heated battle

between three or four players,
two of whom will be freshmen
Curtis Martin and Tim Colicchio.

“We’re looking for the young
guys to come in here and
contribute right away, and we’ll
have a four—way run,” Hackett
said.

Entering spring drills, senior
Glenn Deveaux was the No. 1
tailback. Deveaux, 5 feet 1 1 inches
tall and 190 pounds, was Pitt’s
most durable running back last
season. .

He displayed his versatility by
starting at both fullback and
tailback, as well as being the

Panthers’ third—leading receiver
with 25 catches, According to
Hackett, Deveaux has emerged
from drills still in the driver’s seat
heading . into fall camp at
Johnstown.

“Glenn works very hard, gives
110 percent on every play; he’s
just very tough,” said Peete.

Deveaux will be pushed hard
by redshirt sophomore Jermaine
Williams. Williams, 6 feet 2 inches
and 200 pounds, showed flashes
of his enormous potential during
spring drills of '89, but he suffered
a sprained ankle early last fall
and missed the entire season with
a redshirt.

Now healthy, Williams gives
Pitt another versatile back, willing
to block for his fullback and

catching the ball very well.

“He has a lot of the charac-
teristics that Curvin had, mainly
the ability to make people miss,
but he’s a little larger and faster

than Curvin, ” said Peete. “He has

Martin, 6 feet tall and 180
pounds, is a ﬁrst—team All-State
selection from Taylor Allderdice
High School in Pittsburgh. Martin

was the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

and Pitisbmgb Press City League
Player of the Year after his season
which produced 1,705 yards on
229 carries, 20 touchdowns and
four consecutive 200—yard games.

Colicchio. 5 feet 11 inches and
208 pounds, led Erie Cathedral

Prep to the PIAA Western AAAA I

Finals, while rushing for 2,355

yards and 37 touchdowns. He-

was also a first-team All-State
selection.

Redshirt sophomore Kevin
Williams will also be very much

in the hunt when he returns from .

an injury. He started three games

last season ‘and rushed for 206 _

yards on 46 carries.
Hackett and Peete are hoping

that these backs will mesh their ,

diverse talents and make Pitt’s

victorious over Joey Calhoun of
Ohio in a 6-5 decision.

Hailing from South Carolina,
145—pound Lamar Thompson
claimed one of two pins in the
championship round. Thompson,
a two-time state champion and
one—time runner-up, defeated
Roberto Rivera of Delaware,
pinning him at 4:45.

Chris Hernandez of Arkansas
City, Kan., recorded the only
other pin of the championship
round, over Steve Best of
Wisconsin. A three-time state
champion, Hernandez pinned
Best at 5:24. “It’s hitting me all at
once. I haven’t actually realized

what the impact of all this is yet,”
said Hernandez. The 152-pound
champion has visited Midwest
powerhouses Nebraska and
Oklahoma but has not yet decided
where he will wrestle next year.

The 160—pound ﬁnals slated
Ohio's Rick Hepp against Paul
Antonio of Delaware. Hepp, of
St. Edward High School, recorded
a 20-12 decision over Antonio, a
four—time state qualiﬁer.

The next weight class featured
another Ohio victory. This time it
was 171-pound Markus Mollica
of Walsh Jesuit. Mollica, a two-
time state champion and winner
of the Iowa Junior Nationals last
season, defeated Matthew Brady

(217-20-2) of Michigan.

“This feels pretty good; it was
quite an experience,” said
Mollica. Unsure of where he will
attend college, Mollica has visited
several schools with plans to
visit several more, as some of the
nation’s top wrestling colleges
fight it out for his verbal
commitment.

Mary1and’s Walter Reed,
undefeated in senior season at
33-0, scored a decisive‘ 15-9
victory over Scott Urban of Kansas
in the 189-pound championship.
His 130-1-1 lifetime record will
undoubtedly land him a spot at
one of the nation’s top wrestling
colleges. 2

termed “Back to Europe” by the
Europeans, he said. According to
Gazdag, Eastern Europe is
returning to a post-World War II
economic level. He said, “There
are troubles with the consumer
economy because there is no
money in Eastern Europe to buy
goods” '

Troubles in the U.S. economy
have hampered the growth of
business in Europe, according to
Gazdag.. The change in Europe
