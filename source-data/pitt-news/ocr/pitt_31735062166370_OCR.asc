Phi Eta Sigma Plans S rin Initiation Banquet

Phi Eta Sigma, national

 freshman honor society,_ held

a dinner-meeting last week to
make plans for Spring initia-

‘ tion.

The society was also told
that the national convention for
this year may be held in [Pitts-
burgh. Plans are now being made
for the event.

Dr. Donald ‘E. Swarts, associate
dean of.men and advisor to the
group reported on the convention
held in December in Florida.

A panel discussion was con-
ducted by Mel Greene, Col. ’58,
after the dinner on the topic,
“Theory of Evolution.”

‘A future smoker was also plan-
ned by the group which this year
has undertaken to hold monthly
dinner-meetings and smokers as
part of their regular social calen-
dar.

Every semester the members
of the society provide a free
tutoring service for undergrad-
uate men in many freshman
subjects.

Oﬁicers of the group for this
year are: Don Kaiserman, presi-

‘. dent; Bob Muzik, vice-president;

Mike Senyk, secretary; Irv Jacobs,
treasurer; A d a m Sommerstein,
historian; John Heidler, senior

Players Set

By DAVE PATTON

Pitt Players will make its
first foreign ’ tour late this
Spring.

The Military Air Transport
Service has scheduled “Briga-
doon” for a 17-day tour of air

bases in the Azores and Iceland,
beginning June 2. ’ ‘

Michael McHale, director of
Pitt Players, made official an-
nouncement of the trip to the cast
last Wednesday evening and said
that everyone was “absolutely
stunned.” _

Only 25 people can be accom-
modated for the trip, according to
Mcl-lale. Included in this number
are the director, two chaperones
and a pianist, Ralph Zitterbart.
The remainder, 21 singer-dancer-
actors, are to be selected from
the present cast of approximately
50 students.

Selection Made

Selection of those who will
make the Azores-Iceland trip will
beannounced at the Pitt Players’
banquet following the closing of
“Brigadoon,” April 27.

During the tour, the troupe will

Elections Committee Postpones
Deadline of C‘andidatePetitions

An insufﬁcient number of candidates for the coming Uni-
versity elections, set for April 10, has caused the Student Elec-

tions Committee to postpone

the deadline for all petitions, A

both for individuals and parties, from last Tuesday until

tomorrow at 3 p.m.

This extension of time was forcedby the factthat ﬁve

class officer sections lacked enoughé

candidates to ﬁll the ﬁve necessary
positions in each class section
while one other class oﬁicer de-
partment and one woman’s Stu-
dent Congress andione Men’s

required number of candidates.

The Elections Committee also
has encouraged the formation of
political parties although being
on a party slate is no pre-
requisite for running.

Righ now one official party has
been set up and sanctioned by the
Committee. This party is known
as the All-University Party.
Lowell Tarbett, Eng. ’57, is chair-
man of the party; co-chairman is
Mitchell Kozikowski, Eng. ’57; and
the secretary is Virginia Van
Goethem, Col. ’57.

Meade ‘Beers, Ed. ’57. is treas-
urer, and Robert Muzik, Eng. ’58,
is secretary-general. ,

The Al1—University Party will
announce its slate tomorrow.

Meanwhile, another party is
in the forming stages. Larry

Miller, Col. '57, who is the tem-
porary chairman in charge of

“There will be another party in
addition to the All-University
Party. If everything goes as
planned, we will have a party

petition and slate in by 3 p.m.,

tomorrow.”

The name of the proposed party
is the All—Campus Party. When
asked who, or what groups, will
make up this party. Miller said,
“It is composed of individuals. We
will have both men and women
running for offices. It will be our
attempt to put on the slate people
whom we feel are qualiﬁed for
positions in Student Congress,
Men’s Council, and all phases of
class oﬁicers.”

Miller further commented, in
answer to the reason for the de-
lay in forming the party: “At the
time petitions were due, there
was no desire to have another
party. The extension of the
deadline deﬁnitely had some-
thing to do with forming the
party.”

Actual campaigning for all of-
ﬁcers got under way today, even

. Testing Pilots

, One of his first experiments in
this new ﬁeld, later to be called
Human Engineering, was to test
the tactual sensitivity of pilots in
order to revise the complicated
and inefﬁcient control panels on
- airplanes. Another interesting dis-
covery at this time made it possi-
 ble for two men in a tank to com-
municate.. Up until then-, the pow-
erful noises of the motors had

made any. talking impossible.
Through" extensive testing, it
_ _was found that the men could hear

“I joined IBM for two clear-cut rea-

Shortly after this program started,

at Yorktown Heights, Westchester
County, N. Y.” _
What does he like best about IBM? \
Probably the fact that he’s so much
“on his own.” “There’s no ‘over-the-
shoulder’ supervision,” he says. “You
schedule your own program and cre-
ate your own ‘pressure.’ And, if you

mendous company growth obviously
oliered every chance for advance-
ment. Second, the work area was
exactly what I was looking for-
transistors and their application to
computer systems?’
Bob entered IBM's voluntary
training program in June, 1955; where
- he studied the entire organization,
its divisions and diversiﬁed products.
He received technical training in com-
puter logic, programming, and com-
ponents such as transistors, cores and
tapes. By September, half his day was
being devoted to an actual project;
by the following March, he was on
this project full time. “Our job was

voices to penetrate. Another in-

teresting test sprung from the

’ realization that the O—shaped mark
used to distinguish American
planes was illegible from a great
distance.

' Through various complicated
tests, it was discovered that
three distinct signs, an O, a star,
and a bar, were necessary for
accurate discrimination.

After the war, Dr. Glaser was
invited to direct a research pro-
gram for the air force at the Uni-
versity of Illinois. The object of
this program was to develop new
methods for the teaching and fur-
ther advancement of trouble-
shooting in electronics.

. Studies Nike -
.In 1952, Dr. Glaser came to
Pittsburgh as a psychologist for
the American Institute for Re-
search. He began to study appro-
priate training of techniques on
the Nike sites in the area.

lHe became a lecturer at the
University. Eventually, he took
a full teaching schedule but still
consulted with the Institute.

While at Pitt, he has done many
experiments connected with the
psychological problems of indus-
try_ and government, and espec-
ially those dealing with the armed
forces. Dr. G1aser’s present re-
search is in the ﬁeld of person-
ality. ..

He is studying the personality

“OLD FRED IS FINALLY WHIPPIN’ om: TRAC TM
INTO SHAPE.” ‘

Dramatic Airlift

It is not often that a college theater group is offered
the opportunity of playing to American audiences in foreign
countries. It is even more rare whenthe United States Air
Force decides to provide the transportation and the audi-
ences at their air bases in the Azores and Iceland.

This rare happening has taken place at the University
through the efforts of Michael J. McHale, director of Pitt
Players. The director undertook to contact the Military
Air Transport Service and inquire about the possibilities of
such a plan being approved by the USAF. The announce-
ment of approval was received by the members of the cast
at a rehearsal last week. .

What this means to the University and the student body
is not too apparent from the facts of the story. It is easy
to see the beneﬁts for the Players cast. , -

But the full impact of this opportunity’ can only be
realized in the light of the national recognition that will
undoubtedly come as a result of this trip. The.value of hav-
ing the name of the University before as many eyes as pos-
sible in as many different areas of endeavor cannot be over-
estimated. \ I

Those areas in which the ‘University at this point has
not been very famousmust be brought to national atten-
tion. It is important that more groups and individuals of
the University are recognized nationally if Pitt is to as-
sume a role of national importance.

It is not enough to be “another great University.” People
have to be told about it. This program of telling people of
Pitt’s accomplishments requires thinking like that shown

‘ by McHale to do the job completely.

IA big University needs big ideas.

L, Station Planning

By Gordon Clowney

(Editor’s Note——This is the first of two columns
on Pitt’s proposed‘ student radio station.)

Not since the University of Pittsburgh Studio
of radio station KDKA operated from State Hall
in the 1920’s, has Pitt been closer to having a uni-
versity radio station than it is at this time.

Although plans are only in a general state at
present, and there is no certainty ~
that a campus station will result,
there is a deﬁnite project under-
way at present to ‘look into the
possibility and ramiﬁcation of a
University station. ‘

A radio‘ inquiry committee
has been set up under the aus-
pices of Alpha Phi Omega, na-
tional service fraternity. Head-
ed by Ed Bernstein and John . ..
Goodman, the committee is attempting to (1) for-
mulate a workable plan of operating a station that
can be submitted to members of the administra-
tion for approval and support, and (2) to obtain
student support and interest for the project.

Both Bernstein and Goodman recently attended
a~ conference sponsored by the Intercollegiate
Broadcasting System, which was held at Union
College, New York, in an attempt to gain informa-
tion which might be helpful in setting up a sta-
tion for Pitt. I.B.S. is a national organization which
serves as a link between college stations through-
out the country and helps them in solving common
problems. .

Letters Sent

Previous to this, letters were sent to and replies
received from various universities operating sta-
tions throughout the country in an attempt to ﬁnd
out how_these stations are operated and some of
the problems and difficulties which they incur.
This information will be evaluated along with a

 

reply received from the Federal Communications
Commission as to the availability of a circuit on
which to broadcast.

The results will then be channeled into a feasi-
ble working planand presented in conjunction
with petitions, now being circulated throughout the
student body, to Dr. Peake and Dean Biddle, in an
eﬁort to gain the support of the administration.

Plans to date show the station costing an esti-
mated $30,000, which the committee is attempting
to get through outside grants. .

If formed, the studies would in all probability

be located in a section of the new Student Union

when it is completed.
Poses Question
The inquiry committee poses the question of
why Pitt has taken a back seat to Duquesne and
Carnegie Tech in the way of acquiring an outlet.
This might be answered in part by the fact that
both Duquesne and Tech are campus schools to a
much greater degree than is Pitt, and ‘therefore 'in
a better position to support a station of their own.
. Another possible disadvantage of a student sta-
tion might result if relations became strained be-
tween the University and KDKA. At present there
exists a relationship between the two, with KDKA
carrying, among other things, educational programs
featuring both faculty and students from Pitt.
There is a similar type of relationship between
Pitt and WQED. It is necessary to maintain the
cooperation of radio and TV mediums in order to
effectively publicize the University and its differ-
ent programs. If a campus station were to attempt
to compete on the same type of programs and
do an ineffective or incomplete job it might result
in KDKA and WQED stepping out of the picture.
On. the other hand it would be possible, if op-
erated on a high enough level, for a Pitt station to

   
 
  
 

effectively supplement the work now being done‘on

radio.

Mobility Around the World . 

By Lyn Stasenko

Pittsburgh fans will just have
to trust the judgment of the
Academy of Arts and Sciences
in the selection of “Around The
World -in 80 Days” as the best
picture of th e ‘
year — at least ~-

until the film
opens h e r e a
the‘ Nixon on

 

April 11. _
Undoubtedly,
much of the

success of the ‘
movie can be
attributed to
the new Todd- _"
A0 p r o c e s s . '
used in th e .
ﬁlming. Mike Todd, Jr., here in
Pittsburgh last week publiciz-
ing the opening of the ﬁlm, said
that the process is a great deal
similar to Cinerama.’At an in-
terview held at the Penn Shera-
ton Hotel, the 27-year-old vice-

‘ president of Todd-A0 produc-

tions, casually hopped atop the
room’s television set, pulled out
a cigar, and jokingly said, “Well,
We’re back to motion pictures,
anyway, so I guess itfs all right

Explained Process 
‘Without further justiﬁcation
for his rather undigniﬁed but
pleasant, down-to—earth behav-

ior, he went on to explain the.

process. “Todd-A0 uses the
same type‘ screen as Cinerama,”
he said, “and achieves the same
effect, we think. The big dif-
ference‘ is that Todd-A0 has a
lot more mobility.”

Asked if he believed the new
process would replace Cinerama,
Todd Junior answered no.
“They’re two entirely different
things. Cinerama, because of its
lack of mobility, will probably
have to stick to travelogue
ﬁlms. In the Todd-A0 process,
we can tell a story. So the two

won’t really be in competition

with each other.”

' Todd went on to describe what
he meant by mobility. “Quite a
bit of the material needed for
shooting a story must be dis-
carded by the Cinerama cam-
eras because there’s too much
distortion in it. That’s due to the
three—camera system used to
shoot the scenes.” Todd-AO is
shot with only one camera. It
was an expensive proposition to

Self. Management

By Donna Considine

Approximately ﬁfteen women
have assumed the full duties of
the Student Hostess Office in
another step in the development
of the studént hostessing pro-
g r a in. Before
this semester
began the office
functioned un-
der the direc-
tion of a mem-
ber of the Dean
of W 0 m e n ’ s
staff as part of
her duties.

With the va-
cancy created
w h e n M i s s
M a r t h a Di-
Fonso left the University in Feb-

 

ruary came a chance for the.

student hostesses to prove their
ability to be administrators. The
role of the student hostess is
thatyof a liason between the pub-

    

Hostesses. She makes the ap-
pointments for tours through the
Rooms, dispatches the guides,
keeps close contact with the In-
formation Room, makes out
daily reports to the Quo Vadis,
promotes discussions about the
Nationality Rooms and answers
the questions of persons who
just drop in to see what the
office is all about. The women
on duty, are happy to be mis-
taken sometimes for another in-
formation room.
Informal Chats

In fact, they hope that more
students and faculty members
will feel free to stop in at any
time for informal chats about

the Nationality Rooms and the '

University. For those of you
who don’t know where the office_
is located, it is a small room off
the Commons Room in the same
corridor as the Information
Room. ,

Miss Helen P. Rush, Dean of
Women, said that she is t grati-

work out, Todd explained, but

/‘dad knew what he wanted and

money was no object.”

Sound System

The sound system in the new

process is also a new idea. “It’s
a six—channel system,” he said,
“capable of producing sound
from 96 different angles. In this
.way, the sound emanates from
exactly the spot on the screen
where the speaker is.” '
The biggest problem, he ex-
plained, was the theater instal-
lations needed for the showing
of Todd-A0 ﬁlms. That’s all be-
hind now, though. Installations
have been made in 33 major
cities throughout the states.”
The problems in shooting of
the ﬁlm itself weren’t too great.
The period in the movie is 1&72,;
but, as Todd explained it, it
wasn’t_too difficult to make the
scenes appear like that period

in the countries where most of

the shooting took place-— India,
Siam, China, ’ and Japan. “In
England, all we had to do was
take down some Coca-Cola signs
in the streets. And, in Paris, the
biggest problem was the towing
away of a couple ’49 Chevys.”

ﬁed at the success of the new
project. She added that the jpb
is worthy of the university and
the Nationality Rooms program
and provides’ added opportunity
for the participants to learn val-
uable responsibility.
Present' System

The present system auspices
of Miss Rush began in the _early
1940’s when her office was mov-
ed from the twelfth floor to the
ﬁrst floor where she sensed the
need for more trained hostesses
to handle the large numbers of

visitors. At that time four stu-’ '

dents were paid by the Univers-
ity for conducting tours.

She then proposed that the
Cwens, sophomore w o m e n ’ s
honorary, become the central
part of a new volunteer pro-
gram for interpreting the Rooms.

The number of volunteers has
grown from the ﬁrst twenty to
the one hundred and ﬁfty hos-
tesses on: campus at the present

time. ‘

Fresh Guilds

Guilds and their degree of success was the subject of a
Commission discussion of last Wednesday night’s meeting.

Suggestions for next year’s Guilds include a closed associa-
tion with the parent organization, closer work between vari-
ous Guilds and chairmen and the Cwen advisors, and earlier

beginning of the program.
Freshman present at the
meeting expressed the view that
.being held back from activities
of the guilds until the end of the
Mentor period weakened the
program.

Individual creative expression
such as in the Art Guild was sug-

gested as one purpose.

puses, interviewing students and selling mechanical dogs,
and one of the most frequent complaints I heard from
undergraduates was, “My faculty advisor doesn’t really

_ care about me.”

Everywhere I went I heard this same cry. (Indeed,
at one university I found 15,000 students jammed in the
ﬁeld house chanting it a cdppella.) But I am bound to
say, dear friends, that you are wrong. Your faculty
advisor does care about you. The trouble is, he doesn’t
know’ you. And no wonder! How do you expect himeto
knowyou when you see him once or so a semester?

Get to be friends with your faculty advisor—1ike, for
example, Alpine R. Sigafoos, a sophomore in timothy and
silage at Texas A. & M.

Alpine R..Sigafoos appeared one night in the living
quarters of his faculty advisor (whose name, by a curious
coincidence, was also Alpine R. Sigafoos).

“Good evening, sir,” said Student Sigafoos. “I am~

come so that you may get to know me better and thus
help me solve the vexing problems that trouble me.”

   

‘lNlzc7[ dare c garages  ’

“And what are those three packages you are carry-
ing?” asked Advisor Sigafoos.

“This,” said Student Sigafoos, holding up the ﬁrst of

, the three packages, “is a carton of Philip Morris Ciga-

rettes, which come in long size or regular, and without
which I never stir. It is, sir, a smoke beyond co'mpare-
full of fresh, natural, unﬁltered ﬂavor that delights the
taste, salves the soul, and turns the whole world into
one long vista of peace and greenery. Try one, sir.”
“Thank you,” said Advisor Sigafoos, lighting a Philip
Morris Cigarette. He puffed appreciatively for an hour

ortwo and then said, “And what is in the other packages
you are carrying?”

“I am rather a complex fellow,” said Student

Sigafoos, “and I don’t expect that you will get to know >
me in a hurry. So,” he said, holding up his second pack- ,

age, “I have brought my bed—roll.”

“I see,” said Advisor Sigafoos, not entirely pleased.
“And what is this third package?”

_ “Well sir, I know that occasionally you will be busy
with other matters and will therefore be unable to spend
time with me. So I have brought along my gin rummy
partner, Walter M. Hand-zlik.”

In the next two years Advisor Sigafoos, living»cheek-
by-jowl with Student Sigafoos, got to know all of the
lad’s personality traits, his hopes, his fea.rs, his drives,
his quirks, his aspirations. At the end of that time,
armed with true understanding, Advisor Sigafoos con-
cluded that Student Sigafoos’s basic trouble was that he
was not really college material. ’

So Advisor Sigafoos got Student Sigafoos a job with
the North Star Hockey Puck Corporation where today he
is head of the puck-packing department and a happy man.

Advisor Sigafoos is happy too. He has time again to
pursue his studies of Trichobrttrachus robnstns, the hairy
f1‘0g- At nlght he plays gm rummy with Walter M.
Handzlik.

FOURTH PLACE—-—Although ‘Vic DeFelice(l30) lost this tough
quarter-ﬁnal tussle to Max Pearson of Michigan, he won the
consolation bracket in the 130-pound class where he met Dean
Corner of Iowa State for third place. DeFelice was again un-
successful as Corner decisioned him, 4-2. Last year the Panther
steady ﬁnished third in the 130-pound ranks.

TOUGH WOLVERINE—-—-Ron Schirf(19l) ran up against one of his

toughest foes in the quarter-ﬁnals when he barely edged Steven

Zervas of Michigan, 3-2, to earn a berth in the semi-finals from
where he eventually went on to take first place. Here Schirf
matches arm strength with Pearson in the opening minute of
their hard—fought struggle. W

   

DELGADOA‘DELEGATES-—0klahoma’s Dick Delgado, in com-
plete control of his championship match with Panther Bill Hui-
ing's(115), is shown attempting to move Hulings into a pin po-
sition in the second stanza of their bout. The Sooner matman won
the match in the third period by scoring a fall in 8:11. This
was the second year in a row that Hulings ﬁnished behind the
champ.

of their overtime match which was awarded to Schirf on a.

championship two weeks before at Penn State. Schirf was the

winner then, too, by a 3-2 score. This was Schirf’s first national
crown.

crowns to a record-breaking total of nine for the Peery household.

CINDERELLA BOY-—Tom Alberts, surprise starter in the na-
tionals after being out of action for nearly two months, tries to
bring Ralph Schneider of Waynesburg to the mat in the ﬁrst
period of their match. Alberts succeeded in getting the take-
down. There was one thing for certain when these twowestern
Pennsylvania foes met in the ﬁnais—--the 167-pound national crown

would go to Waynesburg. Schneider wrestles for Waynesburg
and Aiberts resides in the same town. '

Dick Delgado, Oklahoma’s diminutive 115 pounder from
San Diego, Calif., had just scored a fall over Panther ace
Bill Hulings in 8:11 of the ﬁnal round to give the Sooners
the national crown. This is the pointat which Coach Rex
Peery’s wrestlers lost all chance of taking the team title.
All the Sooner grapplers were extending congratulations to
Delgado when their mentor-—Port Robertson—-ambled down the aisle,
looking for a seat so that he could see the ensuing match between

Ed Peery‘ and Harmon Leslie of Oklahoma A & M for the 123-
pound title. 1.

L The stocky Sooner tutor spotted a seat next to me and sat down.
“Well coach,” I said, “how do you feel now? The championship is

_yours. Pitt doesn’t have a chance for the title.‘ The best they can

do is ﬁnish second.”

Robertson, extremely jittery, began squirmming on his fold-
ing chair. The Peery-Leslie bout was ‘in progress. “Are you
sure?” he asked. “Do you really mean that? You’re sure, now?
There’s no chance for Pitt to overtake us, is there?” The gloomy
reply was, “No coach, not a chance. The championship remains
in the state of Oklahoma.”

“I’ll tell you something,” conﬁded Robertson. “That’s news to
me. I’m not a drinking man, but if you’re right, I’ll buy three beers
and drink one, too.”

The Sooner teacher remained hesitant about accepting congratu-
lations. He couldn’t believe his team had won. He querried Ken
Ferris, Oklahoma’s athletic business manager, if such was evident.
Together they huddled over a piece of paper and began calculating
the maximum number of points the Panthers could obtain ‘and the
minimum number of points his boys would score. After a minor de-

, bate, Robertson was convinced that he could enjoy the rest of the

matches without too much anxiety. _ M
By this time the Peery-Leslie feud was in the third period,
and Peery was trailing much to the amazement of the Field
House crowd. Robertson just couldn’t sit relaxed, and began to‘
cheer for Peery to rally and down the Oklahoma A & M matman.
“Ndrmally I’m for Oklahoma boys, but this is one, time I’d
like to see the title remain in thepEast,” muttered Robertson.

He kept clinching a stray press pencil and yelling encourage-
ment to Peery who was facing a desperation challenge in these last
two minutes. The whole life of Ed was resting on these two critical
minutes. .

His life dream of duplicating the three national crowns won
by his father and brother was rapidly escaping. The crowd was in
an uproar, and Robertson was too. “Come on Ed boy, powder it
on him. Come on Ed, you just" 7
gotta win. You just gotta win,”
shouted Robertson in an scratchy
voice barely audible.

Leslie then maneuvered Ed
into another precarious position.
Robertson became all the more
excited, grabbing his slightly
balding head and screaming,

I “No, no, no.” Ed wiggled out of
danger and a sigh of relief was
present. ‘‘That’s a boy, Ed.” A

 

with more pressure on him than
the other two combined (re-
ferring to Rex and Hugh). He
sure has a lot of heart.”

now, and the nervous Robertson

Alberts Wins

The 191-pound championship

bout was a repeat of the Eastern
tournament ﬁnal, as Ron Schirf
duplicated his victory over Navy’s
Tony Stremic. The Middie prov-
ed somewhat tougher than he was
at the EIWA tourney, forcing
Schirf to 1-1 ties in both the reg-
ular match and the overtime per-
iods. As in Peery’s case, overall
aggressiveness and mat ability
gave Schirf the refs decision.
- Alberts, who was declared
scholastically ineligible for the
last quarter of the regular sea-
son, and wasn’t‘ expected to be
in shape, amazed the experts
when he became the only sop-
homore to win a title, ending
with a decisive 8-5 win over
Ralph Schneider of Waynes—
burg.

Bill Hulings had an easy time
in the 115-pound division until
he ran into Dick Delgado of Okla-
homa in the ﬁnals. The Sooner
proved too good for the Canons-
burg senior, running up a 8-0
score before pinning him in 8:11.

Johnny Johnston of Penn State
took the 130-pound title by trip-
ping Max Pearson of Michigan.
8-5, and Vic DeFelice placed
fourth as he dropped the consola-
tion match to Dean Corner of
Iowa State, 4-2.

In every tournament, the
most coveted individual
award is the Most Valuable
Player Award which went
this year to Dan Hodge, a 177
pounder from Oklahoma.

Prior to the NCAA classic,
Hodge was undefeated in 41
matches while winning the last
22 with falls. He continued his
perfect performance at the Field
House by pinning Richard Gar-
retson of Rutgers in 5:50 and
Alex Skirpan of the Panthers in
0:50 in the preliminaries and
quarter-ﬁnals.

In the semi-finals, Hodge’s per-
fect pin record was shattered as
he met John Dustin, “the boy who
got away.”_ Dustin, from Oregon

Dunlap and Joe Gordon. Dunlap

led the team last year with a .333
average, while the smooth-ﬁelding
Gordon batted .267.

If Moog runs into unexpected
trouble, Lewis wil be able to call
upon more than one of his mound
staff. He has senior Carl Lind-
strom, junior Bill Gilmore, and
sophomore Bill Hamilton in re-
serve. Another flinger, John Mira-
belli, has come up with a sore arm
and has been un-able to throw
hard. '

Your decision is important to us, too, because we are

The fact that Boeing is an “engineers' company” is
important to your success. At Boeing, you’d work with, i

Although losing a decision to

The only other man to compile
an impressive record in the tour-
nament with all victories ‘garnered
by pins was Mike Rodriguez of

Michigan who lost a 9-3 decision,

to Doug Blubaugh of Oklahoma
A & M in the ﬁnals.

Rodriguez was penalized two
points in the opening matches of
the match for “slamming” Blu-
baugh to the mat. In the process of
a trip this is allowed, but if in-
tentional, then a penalty can be

 called. ‘

Referee Dupre felt that it was a
slam and therefore called a pen-

careless and found himself on the
