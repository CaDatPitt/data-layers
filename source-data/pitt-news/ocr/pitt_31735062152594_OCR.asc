When Captain Smith leads his
charges onto the ﬁeld tomorrow after-

Inoon, to do battle with the Carlisle

Indians, the Blue and Gold will be

‘given such a reception as has seldom

been accorded a Pitt team.

After the Gold and Blue team re-
turned from the north with the

‘Ithacans bound to their chariot wheels,
. enthusiasm‘ ran high.

The spirit
ebbed' after the Westminster game,
but faith in the team remained un-
shaken. The s‘ortie_of Saturday which

sent the Navy eleven to “Davy Jones”

bri_ghtened‘the situation and it is with’
unbounded enthusiasm and conﬁdence
unshaken that the supporters of the

._Panthermen are awaiting the clash
, ,The blaring ﬁnish of the baseball

.championship series has centered the
interest of Pittsburgh , sportdoin
around the Pitt gridders. With the ex-
ception of the Wilkinsburg game, the
students have had no opportunity to
witness their challengers in action.
It is, therefore, with interest inten-
siﬁed that Pitt fans will crowd Forbes
witness Dufffs

‘Warner’s twice defeated‘
Braves. "

Interest is added to the contest by
the cloud of. mystery that surrounds

’ the probable composition of the team,
‘which will be chosen to defend Pitt's

scalp against the invaders. No one,
except the big resourceful coach him-
self, knows exactly who will hold
down the eleven contested positions,"
and until the team takes the ﬁeld no
one in the crowd will know who the

1 fortunate menare. _ I «

"Meanwhile, there seems to be a pref-
erence in the choice of the men for
the Varsity team during the last
practices. Peck’s stellar performance
at Annapolis, coupled with the fight he
has shown during the past week seems
to mark him as a favorite for the
hub position. Shapira is pushing him
hard and will probably have a chance;
before ﬂie ﬁnal whistle shrills. Smith

and Soppitt have been presenting. a..

line smashing game on either side of
center, but Reese and McQuiston have
been so eﬂicient that It is diﬁicult to
draw a preference. The line crump-
ling, interference leveling of “Big
Jack” Sutherland and “Dutch” Hock-
ensmith at the tackle places will un-
doubtedly win them a notch in the‘
initial call. Jones and Thornhill have
been ﬁghting far too hard to be long
displaced, and thgr will be back in
their berths before the
battle. The wing positions have been
held by Carlson and Herron, while
Matson and Harrington push them
hard for the coveted places.

The injury received by “Chalky”
Williamson in the Navy scrap will pos-
sibly keep him from his accustomed
“Chalky’s”
low-shooting puzzling spirals and
spectacular open ﬁeld dashes will be
sorely mised by the Pitt supporters,
but with Heil and De Hart totake
his place the position will be ably
ﬁlled. The steady head work of Heil
has become a watchword with the

’ followers of the game in this section.
‘ De Hart made his debut as ﬁeld mar_-

shal at Annapolis, and his creditable
performance in/that capacity has, ap-
parently, resulted in his being shifted
from half to‘: quarter. “Foxy” Miller
and “Red” Hastings have been. show-
ing the stuff at half back, .but beyond
a possibility, 'Dillon’s crashing ].ine
plunges will earn him a place in the
accounts of the games. The injury
to Collins at Annopolis will probably

' give Hanley the start at full. _ Han-

ley’s end ruris and quick, intricate

I passes are _winners, but Collins is un-

doubtedly a peer at line rushing.
The fact that Duﬁ’ was able to de-
feat the Navy without being forced

—to show his ?hand tremendously in-

creases " the strength of the Pitt
strategic position and leaves the whole
planof attack veiled to the eyes of
the enemy in tomorrow’s,clash.
Those who have settled down to the
belief that the Reds will be beaten
easily, or will not present Pitt an
opposition worthy of best -effort, are

CHANCELLOR   DEDICATES
SCHENLEY PLAYHDUSE

Pitt students look with interest on
the opening of a theater in’ this dis-
trict. With a beautiful building,
good management, and convenient
location, the Schenley should become
popular with University students.
The consensus of student opinion
seems to be against stock company
productions, but it is very probable
that another form of entertainment
will be installed when the new Davis
theater in Sixth ave. is completed.

A At the opening of the Schenley
theater last Monday, Chancellor Mc-
Cormick delivered the eledicatory ad-
dress, Hewas introduced by Dennis
Harris, the manager of the new play
house. '

He spoke very highly of the pro-
prietors, Harry Davis and John P.
Harris, and congratulated them on
the completion of ‘the - new theater
which they were presenting to the
theater—goers of Pittsburgh. The
Chancellor said in part:

“I am glad- to welcome a theater to

this part of the-city for a two-fold
reason: First,—-Because I a ,.good
theater can be made a means of edu-
cation. The stage. is of unquestioned
worth if it_ is conducted by the right
kind pofmen. We ..,have. in this com-
munity a ‘great ‘Institute, with its art,
its music, its library and its school
of technology;Ia great athletic ﬁeld;
a great Masonic temple; a-. great
patriotic building in the Soldiers‘
Memorial; a group of beautiful club
buildings; a great university; several
beautiful churches, and- it is not in-
appropriate that there should be in
such a community a beautiful build-
ing used for dramatic purposes. _
_ ‘The second reason is because it
is‘ under the control of and operated
by men who believe in clean and
wholesome plays. As long as these,
men pursue such a- policy, so .long
will it be my pleasure to approve
their‘ efforts. I amvpleased to make
this ‘declaration of my attitude ‘be-
cause I believe it is the only consis-
tent attitude if the theater is to be-
come the educational power it ought
to be in America.” C

W. A. A. MEETING CALLED-

The Women’s Activity association
will hold a meeting after chapel Fri-
day, Oct. 23d, at which time every

 

be present.

As the name suggests, the associa-
tion was formed to regulate the ac-
tivities 'in which the “co-eds” are in-
terested and every girl is expected to
become a member. _ ‘

The constitution’ of the organiza-
tion provides for an equal represen3
tation among the organized and the
unorganized members. As the or-
ganized girls have already elected
their members to the executive board,
the unorganized girls will elect their
representatives at the meeting next
Friday. .

Every girl is requested to remain’
after chapel next Friday. They are
tic be prepared to pay the 25 cents

ues.

Prof. J. F. Raschen of the German
department has. issued, a call for a
meeting at 11:30 Monday morning in

may be interested in the formation of‘
of a German club_ in the University.
Such an organization of the nature of
those found in all the large univer-
sities of the country is found to be a
valuable adjunct. in the study of a.
language. Clubs of this nature in
other schools produce German plays
and secure the patronage oﬁosome of
the most prominent men who come to

NOTABLE CHEMIST.

 

,_ Dr. A. Rosanoif, who comes to '
the University of Pittsburgh as pro-

fessor of Research Chemistry in
Mellon Institute and the Graduate
School, will bring with him several

of his students who will continue
their study with him for higher
degrees. Ten or more of such

students are expected to ‘enroll at Pitt
during the next few days. This
custom is frequent in’ the German
universities where students follow
their preceptors from one city to an-
other as they, change thdr place of
residence. ’ ‘ ~

Dr. Rosanoﬁ was educated at New
York University and at Berlin and
Paris. For several years he was as-
sociated with Thomas A. Edison as
a" research assistant. He was pro-
fessor of research chemistry in New
York University and in Clark Univer-
city for some time. He was born in
Russia in 1874. Dr. Rosanoﬁ’ is
recognized as one of the most bril-

liant research chemists in America.I

Dr. Rosanoff has already arrived to
take up his new duties.

PITT wunsialllcii

Country-wide attention has been at-
tracted by the evening course offered
by the School of Engineering,‘a com-

plete description of which appeared‘...

in a recent issue of THE PITT WEEK-
LY; Newspapers from all parts of
the country  "published reprints

 pie ..-for _ the beneﬁt of
college graduates, vho‘ found their col-
lege work incomplete for the work re-
quired in engineering ﬁelds. 'All have
commented, most of them favorably,
on the ‘great extension such aI work
signiﬁes in anengineering education,
and the possibilities it contains for
young engineers desirousgof further-
ing their professional education. Fol-
lowing is a copy of such. a commen-
dation in the columns of the Boston
Evening Transcript, which -maintains
a special column for the criticism of
the work of high standard colleges
and universities:

PITTSBURGH~ RENAISSANCE.

Pitt has high aims in Engineering
Education. _

“The city of Pittsburgh, already one
of the greatest American centers of
the engineering industry, is appar-
ently planning to become as great a
center of engineering education.’ The
University of «Pittsburgh is now of-
fering a new and unique course——an
evening course in engineering for
graduates of reputable colleges. Many
young engineers ﬁnd after engaging
in practical work that the courses
which they took in college did not
prepare them for their profession.

 
 
    
  

       

Few of them ‘have either the incli- V

nation or the means to abondon their
work and go back to college for furth-
er studies, but many of them are in
a position to devote their evenings to
new courses. It is for such men that
the new univeristy work is primarily
designed. Those who meet certain re-
quirements will be eligible for a regu-
lar university degree.” - _

Beneath this article appeared a
short statement of the work done ,' by
Harvard and Yale engineering» schools.

Not .only in the daily newspapers,
but also in special engineering pub-
lications, have equally favorable com-
ments been inserted. The “Railway
Age” gave a full column in discussion
of .the new course, and the “Iron Age”,
and the “Railway Journal” were en-
thusiastic over the possibilities m-
plied for young engineers.
work as this made Pitt what it is in
prominence and efficiency. '

“DENTS” BURY HATCHET.

In accordance with their annual
custom, the Freshman class of the
School; of Denistry entertained the
Junior class in a “peace party” at the
Grand Theater after the class foot-
ball game on last Wednesday after-
noon. “Pep” was thrown about by
the bucketfull. About 150 ambitious
“dents” were in the crowd, and they
made so much noise that the Grand
manager breathed a sigh of - relief
when the" performance. was over. Most
of the party adjourned to McKees-

Mmzns CLOSE  
    ANNUAL sissmn

During the convention of the. Amer-
ican Institute of Mining Engineers
- held here last week,«special emphasis
was placed upori the fact that Pitts-
burgh is one of the principal mining
centers of the country, and conse-
quently it enhanced the value of the
University’s location in such a center.
The convention was held on Thurs-
day, Friday, and Saturday of last
week, and was attended by many of
the students in mining.

On a whole, the convention was di-
vided into three sections, iron and
steel, coal and coke, and the mineral
section.‘ Before the coal and coke sec-
tion last Friday,. H. A. Kuhn, in. a
speech on .“The Pittsburgh Coal Field
of Western Pennsylvania,” cha eter-
ized Pittsburgh coal as one the

dustries, showing that this region
‘furnishes the fuel-energy for. the
greatest manufacturing and industrial
enterprises on the globe. Besidesthe
fact that it produces more coal than
anywhere else in the world. Pittsburgh
is the leading ducer in America of
«radium, alumi ,'and ﬁre brick, and
it is the center cf the petroleum in-
dustry,.which is fairly classed as min-

selection of Pittsburgh as the seat of
_the principal station. of the govern-
ment bureau of mines with‘ its pro-

station. .

In the management and entertain-
ment of the convention, men connect-
ed with the University l:ook~an im-
portant part. S. A .Taylor of_ the
board of trustees was chairman of the_
executive committee, L. "W. Scaife of
the committeeion entertainment, and
H. B. ’Meller of the School of Mines
was a member of the committee on
arrangement. I

  FUR G0_MPET|TORS

To-day marks the inception of a

 

ministration of the_ Musical clubs ‘of
the University. Formerly tossed
about from year to year by varying‘
grades of managers questioning only
how" great will be the year’s debt, the
clubs managed to exist only because
their music was of such a character
that the University would not allow
it to be discontinued.

During last year the’ clubs acted
on‘ three different constitutions, each
one aiming at the right idea, each
one gaining new ground. It remained,
however, for the last of the three, for
whichthe clubs are in a great meas-
ure indebted to L. J. Heath, their
faculty advisor, to become the
permanent constitution of the clubs.

' Competitors, Called Out

The one big feature of this consti-
tution is that it provides for a thor-
ough training of the one who, wishes
to become the manager of the cliibs
before he attains to that office. This
is accomplished by calling out com-
petitors from the Sophomore class
who are directed in the detailed work
of the management by the manager
and his assistants and an accurate
account of their services are kept
according to the table ennumerated
in article six of the constitution.

’ Assistants Elected

The assistant managers are to be
elected on the third Friday of each
year, in an election open to those
schools which have furnished a com-
petitor, the election to be conducted
by the Board of Control. Voting will
be by ballot. The two men receiving
the highest number of votes will be-
come the ﬁrst and second assistant
managers-according to the number of
votes received. Only the three‘com-
petitors receiving the highest per-
eentages will be eligible to this elec-

Ion.

The competitors who try for places
need not be members of the Muiscal
clubs, or have any talent in that line.
Ability to get concerts, sell tickets,
secure patronesses and do the routine
work necessary will be the only
requirements which the competitor
will have to measure up to.

These men who serve as competi-
tors during their ‘Sophomore year
will, if elected, serve as assistant
managers during‘ their Junior year,
and _then from the two.- assistant
managers the clubs will elect their
"manager who will serve as such dur-
ing his Senior year.

‘We publish the ‘constitution entire,
not only that those expecting to join
the club as musicians, singers or
competitors can see exactly what the-
club is‘, *but- that it may be used as a
sample by other clubs of the Uni-
versity who could proﬁt by so doing.

It was the ﬁrst joint meeting of

hear this missioner voice his appeal.

Mr. McClelland is the ‘man respon-
sible for the large delegation that rep-
resented Pitt atthe seventh quadren-
nial convention of the Student Vol-
unteer movement for Foreign missions
at Kansas city -last ‘January. He
came to ‘Pittsburgh and created such
an, interest that the combined associ-
ations sent eleven delegates tothe
convention.

“‘If our religion is what it claims
to be,” said the speaker, “w eought to

School of Education.

At the usual Wednesday assembly,
Dean Chambers urged all the fresh-
men to become familiar with‘ the Uni-
versity songs, as they are calculated,
more than anything else, to instill the
proper school spirit in the students.
Owing to .the rapid growth of the
School of Education, the assembly hall
is no longer large enough to meet the
demands of that .department. Dean
Chambers offered the suggestion that
the upper classmen be excused on the
days that freshmen are present.- The
students, however, decided that they
would rather suffer the discomﬁture
of the crowded conditions, than be ab-»
sent from the assembly. -Both the
dean and the students agreed the in-
ﬂuence of this mid week meeting in
the School of Education is so beneﬁc-
ial to all that it should not be dis-
pensed with. —

The regular work for the School of
Education begins in the Gymnasium,
Oct. 19. All the freshman girls who.
have not reported’ thus far, are asked
to do. so before this date.

Kniffen of the department of ﬁne and

cation,’ and Miss Henrietta Pyre of

‘Prof. Smith analyzed the process of
:pl10l20 sculpturing, which he himself
linvented during the past year, and ex.-
;plained thevalue of this method over
gthose formerly used. This new pro-
cess is so perfect that, when com-
pleted, a picture of the living subject
will exactly correspond with another
picture of the sculpture itself, in size,
appearance, and shape. In addition to
this, it requires only ﬁve minutes of
the sitter’s time to produce the photo-

       

graphs from which the model is

formed, whereas by previous methods
many hours were consumed in effect-,

:_The extension work of the School

 Mines has now- been recommenced

and it promises to be even more suc-
cessful than before. Prof. Zimmer-
man is giving instruction to the min-
ers of Russelton, Yukon, Mount Pleas-
ant, ‘Connellsville and Uniontown.’ ,A
special course of instruction for mine
foremen is being given by Prof. Black
at Irwin. It isexpected that several
more classes will be added during the
next few weeks.

The Mining Society of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh was formally 0_r—

ganized by the students of the School

of Mines at a meeting last Wednes-
day morning. The following oﬁicers
were elected: president, W. G. Flood;
vice president,'C. H. Corbus, Jr.; sec-
retary, L. 0. Shannon; and treasurer,
J.,'H. Clements. Application has been
-made for admittance as .a student
branch to the American Institute of
Mining Engineers. The formation Of

such a society is designed to aid the ,
students in the study of mining en-'

gineering and to give them the bene-
ﬁt ‘of the association with the best

YEDDISTRICT SCHOOL ..
BY FACULTY MEMBERS.

If anyone had chanced to drop in at
the home of. Dean Fetterman, in
Castle Shannon, last Wednesday from
8:30 to 11 o’clock, he would have be-
held a strange sight-—the college fac-
ulty being sent to school. Deemirig
them prepared insufficiently for their
position, Dr. Sage, the teacher, as-
sembled them all together Wednesday
night and gave them a thorough drill
in the A B C’s. A music lesson was
then conducted, and a .quartet com-
posed of Prof. Holder, Prof. Raschen,
Mr. Foraker, and Mr. Arthur, assisted
by Dr. Snyder, after practicing the
scales, tried a few selections. Prof.
Raschen and Mr. Holder, being caught
throwing chewing gum wads, were
forced to sing a duet as punishment,
Mr. Bothwell playing.» There were
many freshmen (faculty) present, in-’
cluding Profs. Raschen, Pratt, Drs.
Jones, Lucien; Messrs Arthur, Web-
ster, Roberts, Clegg, Bothwell, Flam-
bard, Klein.
a vigorous initiation, being forced to
sing songs and give Pitt yells. The
initiation fell ﬂat, however, as the
freshmen out-yelled the whole crowd.
Cheerleader Holder promised to give
Conway a hot race for his job.

At adjournment a note of ‘thanks
was given to Dr. and .Mrs. Fetterman.
A private car took them to and from
Castle Shannon.
