Students’ closest encounter with their
future chancellor could occur/by accident.

While some universities have set up
meet—and-greets for similar searches,
Pitt is operating under conﬁdentiality
for candidates’ visitations.

But, if Pitt takes cues from universities
of similar size, at least some members of
the University will see the face of their
potentialcommander in chief. Open ses-
sions with ﬁnalists could also be key to a
successful search, accordingto academic
research.

The University of Akron’s presidential
search committee will invite university
representatives, the mayor and local busi-
ness CEOs to meet their could-be leaders
when they visit the campus this spring.

A similar rendezvous will occur at the
University of Memphis this March and
has already taken place at the University
of Oregon in June 2012 and Iowa State
University in September 2011.

But no one will say if community lead-
ers or university representatives will meet

It’s early, but Pennsylvania Democratic
gubernatorial candidates have begun to
line up, and on Sunday, they plead their
cases to Pittsburgh-area voters.

The eight candidates gathered at Carn-
egie Mellon University at 2 p.m. Sunday to
address a range of issues, including state-
wide fracking.

After the Democratic Primary elections
May 20, one of the candidates will face
incumbent Gov. Tom Corbett, who has
served as the state’s Republican governor
since 2011. Corbett announced his plans to
run for a second term in November 2013.
The general election will take place No-

Pitt’s next chancellor.

Stephen Tritch, chairman of the Board
of Trustees, declined to comment Jan.
11 on whether Pitt’s chancellor search
committee would reveal the names of
Pitt’s ﬁnalists or if they would meet with
members of the University.

Christopher W. Hunt, the president of
HSZ Media, a company based in Green-
wich, Conn., that publishes news and
the industry report for the search ﬁrm
industry, said that while procedures
vary depending on the school, ﬁnalists
typically meet with various department
heads, the Board of Trustees and student
leaders.

Tritch would not release the num-
ber of applications and nominations

received, a description of the candidate
body nor the names of those who will
meet with ﬁnalists. He declined to com-
ment on whether the University com-
munity will know the search committee’s
ﬁnal candidate selection before the Board
of Trustees makes its decision.

Ken Service, University spokesman,
said onjan. 10 that he could not comment
on the questionsbecause the committee
has not yet shared its plans with him.

But open sessions have a number
of beneﬁts, according to a 1990 re-
port, “Choosing a college president:
opportunities and constraints.” Judith
McLaughlin, educational chair of the
Harvard Seminar for New Presidents and
the Harvard Seminar for Experienced
Presidents, and David Riesman, a late
sociologist and Harvard professor, pub-
lished the report.

McLaughlin and Riesman said that

open sessions help ﬁnalists learn about
the university, show how ﬁnalists act
under pressure and demonstrate ﬁnal-
ists’ interest in the position.

The American Association of- Uni-
versity Professors, an organization that
promotes academic freedom and shared

governance, released a report in 2012 -

about faculty conﬁdentiality that drew
similar conclusions. . A

“The names of ﬁnalists should be
made public to the campus community
so that the community at large, faculty
committees or at least selected members
have an opportunity to interview the ﬁ-
nalists,” the report said. ,

But the report acknowledged that
conﬁdential searches are becoming an
industry ‘standard.

Pitt is not the only school keeping a
tight lid on the process.» Penn State Uni-
versity is also looking to ﬁll its top execu-

 

     

tive spot under complete conﬁdentiality.

Although Jill Shockey, Penn State’s
spokeswoman,Asaid she could not re-
lease information on thejan. 10 search,
the cross-state rivals have released more
pieces of information.

. On Sept. 10, Penn State released a
statement reporting that Isaacson, Mill-
er, the search ﬁrm conducting the univer-
sity’s search, contacted 400 individuals
for the position.

According to the statement, the pool
comprised of “substantial numbers of
women, underrepresented minorities
and leaders in the corporate and non-
proﬁt sector.” H

Tritch declined to release similar in-
formation. .

CHANCELLOR

Hillel Hoffmann, Temple’s spokesman,
said he could not reveal if ﬁnalists met
with groups on campus during its 2012
presidential search for conﬁdentiality
reasons.

“What I can tell you is that the ﬁnalist,
who was recommended by the search
committee, came to campus and met with
a number of groups before the Board of
Trustees chose him as the next presi-

Ardent,” Hoffmann said.

That ﬁnalist was Neil Theobald, who
still holds the position today.
'Hoffmann said that the university ex-

tended an open invitation to the student ‘

body, university employees and staff to
ask Theobald questions during three
public sessions hosted the day before
the Board’s ﬁnal decision.

While it is still unknown if depart-
ment heads will meet the search ﬁnalists,
some deans will meet the prospective
leaders through their role in the search
committee.

Reasons why you should stop sharing list articles

Sophia Al Rasheed
I Columnist

Spoiler alert: This is not a list.

It’s nearly impossible to scroll
through social media sites without ﬁnd-
ing a link concerning a list such as “25
things to do before you turn 25” or “best
places to party before you die.”

The Buzzfeed-inspired lists have hit
popularity on many Internet news sites,
including The Huffington Post and Slate.

There are two main reasons I came up
with as to why these “articles” are being
shared so frequently, despite their lack
of substance and the pretention of an
author who feels the need to share his or
her experiences. First of all, these lists
prove that we do something with our
time on Facebook aside from prying into
each other’s business. More importantly,

however, we usually ﬁnd some shallow,
general connection to one of the many
items listed. .

As much as these lists make readers
feel “understood,” their fate ultimately
depends on our ability to quit sharing
them. They cheapen the appeal of ac-
tual Internet-canvassed news articles by
being passed around like a large-scale
inside joke.

I fell prey to this last week, when The
Huffington Post published an article de-
scribing the 19 most interesting colleges.
Why they couldn’t ﬁnd a 20th college to
make the list more clean-cut still bothers
me, but this became the least of my an-
noyances. After I saw that Pitt was on the
list, I wasn’t surprised that it poppedup
on my newsfeed a few times, with heart
emojis and #H2P.

‘ To my surprise, the article didn’t

really have anything that would make
me proud to repost it, and it certainly

__didn’t bring attention to anything that

we couldn’t have -easily observed our-
selves. Pitt’s “interesting” character-
istics included a few sentences about
its supposedly hipster zip code — ac-
cording to RealtyTrac, which considered

.South Side a future hipster'hangout,be—
‘cause of its high rental return rate — and

the fact that the Cathedral of Learning

I looks like Hogwarts. Despite the fact that

every other college on the list featured

fadescription of its accomplish_ments_ I
‘alongside truly interesting character- 1

istics, many Pitt students on my news
feed (and those not on it, I assume) felt
enough pride to share this news.

The main issue I had with the article

T‘ was that s.omeone without credentials
— felt the need-to‘7take up‘-perfectly good”

internet space just to voice their “much-

needed” opinion and create yet another

“much-needed” list. But readers con-
tinuing to‘ blindly share these articles
just for the sake of relating to them
somehow highlights how ultimately nar-
cissistic these lists are, on both the level
of the author and the level of the reader.

Sadly, there’s little reason to believe
that the number of lists will decrease af-
ter simply running out of topics to cover.
Wherever there’s a self—centered per-
son with access to the Internet, there’s
bound to be a list tocreate some unnec-
essary post for sharing. If you type “25
signs you...” in a search bar, the ﬁrst two
results that appear are “25 signs you’re
addicted to Diet Coke” and “25 signs
you’re a hot mess.” Apparently, you can

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers keep composure“ late to win at Maryland

pk Nate Barnes
. ,Spor1fs Edz't_0r

COLL‘-EGE PARK, MD. — Nearly 12 minutes

remained on the clock in the second half at
the Comcast Center in College Park, Md., and
the No. 20 Pitt Panthers built their largest lead
of the day with two free throws by redshirt
senior forward Lamar Patterson to go up by

V 13 points. ..

The 13-point lead turned to just seven in
two minutes after a 3-pointer by Nick Faust,
beforejake Layman scored intransition and
made his and-onetry.

Ten minutes remained inahostile environ- I

ment that redshirt junior Cameron Wright
called “dark,” but the Panthers chugged along
to an 83-79 victory. The Terrapins attempted
to throw a zone press at the Panthers, which
took all of about 10 seconds for Patterson to
break through and lay in the ball.

_ Patterson busted the full-court zone de-

fense after a Maryland miss and foundwright
for a layup to push Pitt’s lead back to 12, sec-
onds after itwas nearly halved. The runwas a

small part of his game-high 28 points, seven

assists and seven rebounds. _

“Between me,James [Robinson] and Cam,
it’s pretty hard to press us because we pass
the ball. We’re great decision makers,” Pat-
terson said. '

When the Terrapins attempted to apply
pressure, Pitt (18-2, 6-1 ACC) was prepared
behind Patterson and steady-handed sopho-
more point guard Robinson, who played in
front of friends and family.

“Every day in practice we go through our
press offense,” Robinson said. “While it might
seem repetitive, it might be a little boring, it
always prepares us.”

Robinson, a native of nearby Mitchell-
ville, Md., and a DeMatha Catholic alumnus,
played in his home state for the ﬁrst time at
the collegiate level and scored 13 points. The

Panthers ran their morning shootaround at
Robinson’s alma mater.

“Our coaches put us in positions to suc-
ceed, and they kind of make our job a lot
easier, the way they prepare us for the game.“

Maryland continued to apply pressure on
the Panthers throughout the rest of the game
and cut Pitt’s lead to ﬁve points multiple times.
Each time, however, Pitt responded with free
throws or a defensive stop.

“That’s all about our relationships,” Wright
said. “We all trust in each other. We all know
that we all can make plays. We all know that
we can depend on each other.”

’ “When it comes down to the crucial mo-
ments, we all have faith in every guy on our
team.”

The Terrapins (11—9, 3-4 ACC) began the
game strong and held a lead for the ﬁrst 10-
plus minutes of the game, something head
coachjamie Dixon knew would happen.

“We talked aboutthem gettingoffto agood

start because they’re going to be out there
and aggressive, coming after us,” Dixon said.
“From Maryland’s start, we took care of things

and then did a great job and withstooda lot _

of runs, furious runs from them.”

Likewise, Patterson anticipated that the
Panthers would not have as easy of a go in
College Park as they did in Pittsburgh, when
Pitt won by 20. ~

“We beat ‘em pretty good at home, and a
good team like Ma_rylanc_1~should take that as a
chance to get back atateam,” Patterson said.
“That’s what they did. They got back at us.”

But the early Maryland lead peaked at
seven points before crumbling as Pitt took
control of the game with apair of free throws
ﬁ‘om Patterson. The senior’s ﬁrst points of the
game gave Pitt its ﬁrst lead, and Marylan
never took it back. - ’

After the No. 8 Pittwrestling team upset No. 5
Oklahoma State early last week, the Panthers
needed to maintain focus just ﬁve days later
against another top opponent.

“It was important not to get caught up in
all the hype after beating Oklahoma State,”
senior Anthony Zanetta said. “With only ﬁve
days in between competition, it was important

to stay focused on the task ahead.”

Zanetta and the he Panthers kept their

defeated the Cavaliers —— who were also un-
defeated in ACC play before Friday’s match.

The Panthers maintained their resolve as
they cruised to a 16-point victory by winning
7-of—1O matches against the Cavaliers. on a
six-matchwinning streak, Virginia entered the

Fitzgerald Field House as a hot team, but the
Cavaliers were outpaced Friday night.

“We got out—wrestled tonight, no question
about it,” Virginia head coach Steve Garland
said. “We haven’t been in this position in a
while.” 4

Athird-period takedown separated Zanet-
ta from his opponent, Nick Herrmann, to
jumpstart Pitt to an early lead.

Virginia’s]oseph Martinez tied the match
at three with his 1-0 victory over Pitt’s_ N 0. 17
Shelton Mack at 133 pounds.

Once again, Pitt’s two true freshmen in the
lineup played an integral role in the team’s win.

“Being halfway through the season, I don’t
feel like a freshman anymore,” freshman Ed-
gar Bright said. “I’ve taken on the responsibil-
ity ofbeing a collegiate athlete, and I’ve grown
a lot mentally'since the preseason.”

No. 19 Bright picked up his second-straight

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Free—throW shooting makes
  difference in College Park

Jasper Wilson
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Free—throw shooting is a common sight in any
organized basketball game.

A player stands behind a line 15 feet from
the hoop _and tries to deliver a sphere into a
metal ring 18 inches in diameter and 10 feet

, above the ground.

But sometimes, it happens a lot.

M Saturday night marked one of those in-
stances for Pitt and the University of Mary—
land, when the visiting Panthers escaped from
College Park, Md., with an 83-79 victory.

Between the two groups,77shotslefthands
and either continued their trajectory through

. the air, hit a piece of metal and dropped inside

or traveled beyond the intended location.

The Panthers made 32 of their free throws,
a 68-percent success rate well below their
season average. But the quantity, not the qual-
ity, was what made the most difference in a
contest won by four points.

The Terrapins (11-9, 3-4 ACC) made more
free throws than any team has against Pitt
(18-2, 6-1 ACC) all season, sinking 23.

Itwas the most Pitt has made since sinking
30 against Stanford in November andalso the
most it has tried since 38 against Savannah
State in the ﬁrst game of the season. Accord-
ing to Pitt head coachjamie Dixon, his team
planned it that way.

“I wanted to get into the plane and get
fouled, and we attacked the basket, Ithought,
well,” Dixon said. “That was what we wanted
to do.”

“[The refs] are calling the game different.

sive, physical, tough team who’s very good
and hard to guard,” Dixon said. “They just
kept battling.”

Pitt’s next game comes Monday night

There’s gonna be more scoring.”

Redshirt senior Lamar Patterson led the
way for his teammates during that stretch
of almost unheard of aptitude,  seven
of his eventual  free throws in the opening
period. He led all scorers with 28 points.

" “It’s easy to get in a rhythm, especially if I

you’re making your free throws — that’s the
biggest thing,” Patterson said. “Whenever a
basketball player sees a ball going through
the basket, it gets you in a rhythm. Gets you
a good feeling.”

His offensive approach exempliﬁed what i

the team wanted to achieve from the start.

“It was going to be physical. You didn’t
want to settle for jump shots,” Dixon said.
“[Patterson] took what was there.”

Redshirt senior Talib Zannawas fouled as
much as his classmate, but couldn’t quite capi-
talize on the resulting opportunities, making
eight free throws and 5—of—6 late in the game.

“I was just trying to make shots down the

“stretch,” Zanna said. “Itwas hard inthat half.”

As abig man at 6—foot—9, the Nigeria native
has attracted the stigma of not being able to
shoot “unguarded 15-footers,” but he doesn’t
ﬁnd the repetitive task arduous.

“It’s not tough. I just gotta keep practicing,
stay in the gym,” he said. “I’m going to ﬁx it.”

Zanna’s attitude toward free throws is a
good thingfor his team because he will return
to that familiar spot on the court soon enough.

“We get to the line far more than our oppo-
nents, and it’s somethingthat we emphasize,
and _I think we’re getting better at, too. I think

against No. 18 Duke and is only the second
game they’ve played against a ranked oppo-
nent. But for now, at least, the Panthers are
happy to have avoided an upset in unfriendly
conﬁnes. ,

“I’m proud of these guys,” Patterson said.
“We held our ground and came out with aW.”,

victory over a ranked opponent, defeating No.
16Joe Spisak 5-3. ‘

“Bigwins back-to-back over ranked wres-
tlers is great,” he said. “My conﬁdence has
grown immensely.” ‘

Fellow freshman Mikey Racciato also
capped a successful two matches with a pin
over Virginia’s Justin Van Hoose. Racciato’s
pin lastweek against Oklahoma Statewas the
match’s deciding factor.

“I’m deﬁnitely more comfortable now just
due to the experience,” he said. “I feel I’m wres-
tllng the same.Just a little harder, and we are

all getting in better shape.”

Virginia narrowed the deﬁcit to just three
points, 12-9, withwins at 157 and 165 pounds.
With the match in limbo, the Panthers

_ rolled their two highest—ranked wrestlers

onto the mat, and they succeeded.

No. 7 Tyler Wilps, at 174 pounds, earned
a major decision over No. 12 Stephen Doty
and took down the ranked Virginia wrestler
ﬁve times. '

It Wasn’t as easy for No. 6 Max Thomus—

seit, who, at 184 pounds, defeated No. 20Jon

, Fausey 5-3.

At 197 pounds, No. 18 Nick Bonaccorsi
secured the official victory. for the Panthers

5 with a 3-1 decision over Zach Nye.

Pitt’s P.J. Tasser won the ﬁnal_match of the
night in overtime. After Tasser escapedin his
down period, he was able to ride out his op-
ponent, Ethan Hayes, for 30 seconds to earn
the victory and push the ﬁnal score to 25-9.

Tasser; who gave up about 50 pounds to

_ his opponent, has been involved in several

overtime matches this season.

“I think [overtime matches] play to my
advantage with my conditioning,” Tasser said.
“As a team, we prepare for the possibility of
overtime. If and when we have to, we canwres—
tle those 10- and 11—rninute long matches.”

Pitt, now alone at the top of the ACC stand-
ings, travels to Westvirginia next weekend for
an out—of—conference matchup.

The Panthers have two matches remaining
against ACC opponents, but the victory over
the Cavaliers will go a longway in decidingthe
ACC’s regular—season championship.

“We knew how important this dual was to
us,” Racciato said. “It’s a huge step in Winning
the ACC.” I

FREE THROWS

we’ve gotten better since we’ve gotten to league
play,” Dixon said. “We’re better end of [shot]
clock and midway through clock of attacking
not settling, so it’s improvement.”

How much more frequent are Pitt’s trips
to the line? It has exceeded its opponents’
combined attempts this season by more than
100 free throws.

After converting 16-of—17 free throws inthe

. ﬁrst half, Pitt could not continue its almost-

perfect rate in the second half. The Panthers
shot just 53.3 percent (16-for-380), including
a 4-of—1o performance in the last two minutes
of the contest that allowed the home team to
stay within two scores until the ﬁnal buzzer.
“We could’ve shot some free throws better,
but you’re not gonna shoot 80 percent all the
time,” Dixon said. “9o percent l94.1] in the
ﬁrst half and shoot as well inthe second half.”
What made his players’ change of fortune at
the stripe so bad in the circumstances, though,
was its sudden appearance and rapid descent.
Staiﬁng point guard James Robinson, a
sophomore, fouled outwith a little more than

a minute left. Seconds later, his replacement,
freshmanjosh N ewkirk, missed back—to-back
free throws.

With Robinson out and Newkirk on the
ﬂoor, Maryland forward Evan Smotrycz
immediately fouled Newkirk as soon as he
touched the ball. The strategy paid off for
the Terrapins.

In the time remaining, the Panthers failed
to put the game out of reach by missing six of
their last 10 free-throw attempts.

The declining success as the game pro-
gressed didn’t have to do with fatigue, the
crowd or other external factors, according to
redshirt junior guard Cameron Wright.

“Nah, it’s not about that. We’ve just got to
step up to the line and knock ‘em down next
time,” Wright said. “That’s all it is.”

‘ He shot 4-of-9 total and went 2-for-6 at
the end of the game.

But Pitt’s inability to ﬁilly capitalize on
what Maryland surrendered didn’t matter,

and Maryland head coach Mark 'I‘urgeon

knew why.

“We fouled too much,” 'I‘urgeon said. “I
know we fouled a lot late, but 47’s a lot of free
throws in the game.” I
