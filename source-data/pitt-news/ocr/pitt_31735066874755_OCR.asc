Men’s Council program of recognized political parties,
later administered by Student Congress, stimulated organized
interest in the proceedings weeks ago. The heated campaign
between two party organizations, that of the Panther group
and the VIP-Pitt coalition took on surprise aspects as women
split on whether they should join parties. The Panther Party,
which started off strong, showed signs of last minute schisms

and internal conﬂict.

However, in the ﬁnal days of campaigning, party organi-
zations drew awaytfrom emphasis on platforms and stressed
worth of individual candidates in a bid to take over Student

Congress, Men’s Council and even to

Self Government Association.

Phi Epsilon Pi
Breaks From

Panther Party

. By ED BACHMAN

A split in the Panther Party
has emerged -during the ﬁnal
days of the campaign period.
Wide-open disagreement on
Panther campaign policy has
caused members of Phi Epsi-
‘Ion Pi to ignore Panther sup-
port in today’s school elec-
tions.

Lennie Epstein, leader of the
Phi Ep moye, stated that lack
of Panther organization, added to
off-hand methods of campaigning,
has caused his group to openly
support the Pitt Party. Epstein
also stated that at least four of the
six Phi Ep candidates running on
today’s Panther slate have pledged
their support to the split. A

Epstein said that Phi Epsilon
Pi. second largest social frater-
nity at Pitt, “will join the Pitt —
Party soon after the election.”

Phi Ep had been split internally
on Panther’s platform, method of
campaigning, andpsecrecy of slat-
ing women. The dispute with the

party came to a head last weekend.

“Publius 2" Blamed
Strong indications point toward
continued unrest within the Pan-
ther Party organization of eight
large fraternities. From the time
of Panther’s second “Publius” pub-
lication last week, “The Rape of
the Independent,” members from
at least two other fraternities have
expressed their strong concern of
Panther’s system of campaigning.
These two frats are Phi Delta
Theta and Sigma Chi, largest fra-
ternity at Pitt. ‘
The three political parties,
meanwhile, were in a rush of
activity in the campaign home- .
stretch. Pep rallies were held,
posters hung around the school,
hand-outs given at each door;
and the continued ﬂow of match-
books, napkins, and “Publius:”
The VIP-Pitt coalition innovat-
ed an eleventh—hour personal con-
tact program last night when the
greater majority of undergradu-
ate _students were contacted by
telephone. No party “plugs” were
given, but instead, the voter was
informed of poll locations, times of
voting, and the necessity of bring-
ing ID cards to the polls.
, Court Clears Women
The Senior Court held their an-
nual Clearing House Saturday to
nominate women running for the
following groups: Women’s Self
Government Association, IDAKA
nurses sorority, Women’s Speech
Association, YWCA, Alpha Beta
Gamma, Women’s Choral, Panhel-

' lenic Association, Women’s Recre-

ation Association, and oﬂicers for
the classes of 1956, 1957, and 1958.

Elections for these positions are
being held today on the twelfth

to be visited by the Soviet editors
have not yet been determined. A
tentative itinerary includes stops
in New York City, Washington,
Detroit, Ann Arbor, Chicago, San
Francisco, and Alabama. Other
cities will be added to the sched-
ule. -

Arthur C. N agle, Director of the
Institute of International Educa-
tion’s Department of Special Pro-
grams,.which has charge of the
arrangements for the tour, com-
mented: “We hope this trip will
give the visitors a maximum
understanding of U.S. student
life.”

Last summer, when the Soviet
student editors ﬁrst applied for
permission to visit the U.S., Soviet
propaganda made much of the
U.S. refusal to grant visas at that
time. The visas were turned down
because American ’
were not then in session. Last year

Russia allowed a group of Ameri- A

can student editors to visit them.

Editorial comment in the na-
tion’s press has endorsed the
projected visit. A New York Times
editorial recently stated, “If the
Russian Government is willing to
expose eleven student editors,
aged 25 to 39, to a close-up view
of higher education in this coun-
try, it is wise of us to accept the
challenge.” ~

WINSTON brings flavor back P

to filter smoking!

I It didn't take long for Word to get
around campus! Winston’s got real ﬂavor
——the full, rich, tobacco ﬂavor you want.
No wonder so many college men and
women are getting together on Winston!
Along with ﬁner ﬂavor, Winston also
brings you a ﬁner ﬁlter. The exclusive
Winston ﬁlter works so effectively, yet
lets the ﬂavor come right through to
you. Easy-drawing~———that’s Winston!

_ Today is election day at the University of Pittsburgh.

1 For some time now officer seekers have been hawking their

wares all over the campus. Signs, slogans, cards, all have
passed before the eyes of the voting student and all are

. relatively meaningless.

The recognitionof political parties this year has had

added a somewhat confusing, angle to the actual elections
themselves. Through party aﬁiliations, candidates are forced '

to accept Whatever propositions their party leaders set
forth. As an alternative the candidates may withdraw from
the party, a move which would seem inadvisable under any
but the most extreme circumstances.

As a result of party ties, some solid candidates may
suffer. -Mud slinging and slur campaigns do little to en-
hance the popularity of even the most able candidates. On
the other hand, a well conducted campaign could serve
to promote an unqualiﬁed. candidate.

The voter is not,.however, between the horns of an
impossible dilemma. But neither will he be able to ex-
tricate himself by simply voting a straight partyiticket’.
Good student government as a result of a highly, competi-
tive campaign will only materialize when the voters weigh
each candidate and vote on individual merit and not on
party affiliations and platform promises.

C’ ’r
By Joan Thomas 

And now, having given ‘up on Publius as
worthwhile subject matter, I shall venture into
the realm of women’s elections. Today ends the
long hours of election matters, not unlady-like
campaigning that would give voters an idea of
‘what platforms and issues candidates stand on,
but long hours of ostentatious, dinners and meet-
ings. - .

First, there. is the nominat-
ing‘ of nominating committees
who nominate candidates.‘
Members of social or, service
groups on this campus get to
nominate only nominating
committees. In so doing girls-
have no assurance that their
choices will be nominated ‘
for vacant ofﬁces. As» in ma-  ‘ -.
ture elections found in realistic governing bodies
elsewhere,‘ why aren’t all-women permitted to
nominate from the floor?

But we have the typical twelfth ﬂoor system.
Nothing can be simple. The ﬁrst meeting is that
with all presidents, to instill in them ‘fthe right
spirit of elections.” It would take 20 meetings to
establish what the “rightispirit of elections” is, and

    

, it is hardly possible to develop such a nebulous

concept over one dinner table.
Simple Process .
> And there must be the meeting of the nom-
inating committees with Senior Court. Instead of
the simple process of stating .your choice for of-
ﬁce from the floors within each group, there are
the long instructions, long secret forms, and long
secret discussions.
Instead of the presidents having the available
list of members‘ QPA’s before them during.nom-

     

 

for is Pomp? 1

inations, Senior Court, that group which dons’

black robes and mortars and passes judgment
on udnderclasswomen decides at the Clearing HOUSC
whether or not a girl’s grades are suitable.
The ostentaiousness of it all is further dis-
,played at the nominees dinner, at which op-
ponents are seated together at the table, but may
not be called opponents. They are simply girls who
happen to be running for the same oﬂice. They
must get acquainted and acquire thecorrect spirit,
realizing that it isn’t really important who wins‘
the election. So much malarkey. Certainly one
girl has better ideas than another, more suitable
for a certain position. But her ideas can not be
publicized, since campaigning is banned ‘as an
unlady-like stunt. ' A

Clearing House

_, The most dramatic, and therefore most, antic-
ipated, event is the Saturday afternoonclearing
House, an immature, .unrea1istic, dictatorial, all
day affair. This isrnecessary under the point scale
system, which‘ dictates how many activities a‘ girl
may enter, and how many oﬁices shemay hold.
The system is designed so that a girl will "not‘;be-
come involved in too tmany extra-curricular ac-
tivities. ‘A

Such a system is not even used in high schools.

-Administration in those, lower echelons assume.

that candidates know their own capacity, and that
the voters know, partly from experience, partly
from judgment, how many oﬁices one woman can
handle.

Yet the twelfthﬂoor leaders continue to boast
that their program turns out women capable of
leadership, capable of mature decision. At the
same time assuming that they do not have enough

common sense or powers of decisions to know how *

much they can handle. This is decided by Senior
Court and administration.

Panther Party Claims
Foul In News Coverage

To the Editor:

The PANT/HER PARTY and
Publius have been charged with
unfair campaigning by the “offi-

cial student newspaper.” This
charge must be answered.
Speciﬁcally, . w e .’ v e b e e n

charged with conducting a cam-
paign of mud-slinging and ‘with
presenting a platform of frater-

nity hogwash. But what is the

truth? Our newsletters have
dealt -with numerous. matters:
the PANTHER platform, the
facts behind the VIPPITT mer-
ger, the duty of students to vote,
the merits of our candidates, and
a discussion of campaign issues.
For once, a party has tried to
reach the student’s intellect
rather than ply him with matches

, and combs or wage a popularity
contest. “Publius” was .a noble
venture.

Joan Thomas calls our plat-
form vague and meaningless.
While the other side promised
libraries, pools, and parking lots,
we limited ourselves to things we
can deliver: schoolwide dances
for the independent student, bet-
ter programs for freshman guid-
ance, and efficiency in Congress.
We didn’t promise bathing
beaches on Fifth Avenue; we
don’t believe in empty words.

What has the News done in
this campaign?‘ It says we’re

 

The Public Interest  

against a proposed Pennsylvania
Korean Veteran Bonus because
the Korean vet was “merely per-
forming his duty to his country”
and that such a plan “is not in
the public interest,” we must
speak out.

We wonder how this civic
group would have felt if we kids
had asked for a bonus when our
backs were against the sea in the
“Pusan perimeter”—or, in our

hour of victory when we’ broke

out of that “perimeter” and
smashed the North Korean Army
+or, whenwe were in the bat-
tles of the all too familiar names
of “Heartbreak Ridge)’ “Chosen

Reservoir,” “Pork Chop Hill” and

“White Horse Mountain.”

We left 33,000 dead buddies
over there and 103,000 .of us came
back with scars of wounds,suf-
fered in ﬁghting for our country.
Yet, we are not in the interest of

as. any a

the public. ,
The proposed Korean Bonus
calls for a $150 million plan to be

distributed to Korean vets. The -

basis would be $10 per month for
domestic duty and $15 per month
for overseas duty during the pe-
riod from June 30, 1950 to July
27_, 1953 with a $500 maximum.
We could use .; that money--
$500 would be a down payment
on..a house, help pay off the car
or ;would :enable us to further
our education after. our Public
Law is used.
Korea was a ‘war as terrible
war ever fought
and we as former ‘G.I.’s want to

forget it but we can’t forget our

friends who died in our arms-—
the boys who really should be
here in our place. A
No, it wasn’t “merely perform-
ing a duty” and we believe we
fought “in the public interest.”

Women Vote Seekers
Claim News Inaccurate

Dear Editor:
Here are facts:

/1. We are not being formally

slated by a political party be-
cause we felt that the integra-

..tion of women into the politi-

cal party system came too late
for us to be ablepto have much
say in any political organiza-

tion. Too many plans had al-_

ready been made by; the men!
2. We are being supported for
re-election. “ It is felt that
since we have experience in
Student Congress, we would
be more qualiﬁed to serve the

University than someone un-'

aware of the potentialities of
Congress. We all have a broad
background of activities.
Members of the Panther Party
are supporting us because of
these qualiﬁcations.

3. You are seeing our publicity.
We formulated it and are dis-
tributing it ourselves. Fi-
nances were carried by the
Committee of the Four In-
cumbents!

4. We are not seeking Senior
Queen nominations! In all
humility, we would not even
presume torthink that we rep-
resent “ideal” personalities,
but We do have principles
that we would not like to have
violated by any political fac-
tion!

SCIENCE MADE s1M1>i.E:_ No. 1

In this day and age, as I like to call it, everybody should know 0.

something about science. Unfortunately: however, the great majority
of us are majoring-in elocution, and we do not get a chance to take
any scienc_e. But we can at least learn the fundamentals.

- Though this column is intended to be a source of innocent merri-

ment for all sexes and not to concern itself with, weighty matters, '

I have asked the makers of Philip Morris whether I might not from
time to time use this space for a short lesson in science. “Makers,"
I said to them, “might I not from time to time use this space for a
short lesson in science?” ' .
“Bless you, lad!” cried the makers, chuckling. “You may cer-
tainly use this space from time to time for a short lesson in science.”
They are very benign men, the makers, fond of children, small
animals, community singing, and simple country food. Their benevo-
lence is due in'no small measure to the cigarettes they‘ smoke, for
Philip Morris is a cigarette to soothe the most savage of breasts. I

refer not only to the quality of the tobacco——which, as everyone I ‘

knows, is amiable, humane, and gracious —but also to the quality
of the package. Here is no ﬁendishly contrived container to fray the
ﬁngernails and rasp the nerves. Here, instead, is the most simple
of devices: you pull a tab, a ‘snap is heard, and there, ready at hand

are your Philip Morris Cigarettes. Strike 9. match, take a. puff, and ‘

heave a delicious little rippling sigh of pure content. 

So, with the cordial concurrence of the makers, I will from time to
time devote this column to a. brief lesson in science.

Let us start today with chemistry. It is ﬁtting that chemistry
should be the ﬁrst of our series, for chemistry is the oldest‘ of sciences,
having been discovered by Ben Franklin in 123 B.C. when an apple

fell on his‘ head while he was shooting the breeze with Pythagoras’
\ one day outside the Acropolis. (The reason they were outside the

Acropolis and not inside was that Pythagoras“had been thrown out
for drawing right triangles all over, the walls. They had several
meetings outside the ‘Acropolis, but ﬁnally Franklin said, “Look,

Pythagoras, this is nothing against. you, see, but I’m no kid any more A

not Shakespeare written “(Jone-.10.”) *

But I digress. We were beginning a discussionof chemistry, and
the best way to begin is, of course, with fundamentals. Chemicals
are divided into elements. There are four: air, earth, ﬁre, and water.
Any -number of delightful combinations can be made from these
elements,-such as ﬁrewater, dacron, and chef’s salad. 0

Chemicals can be further divided into the classes of explosive
and non-explosive: A wise chemist always touches 8. match to his
chemicals before he begins an experiment.

A great variety of containers of different sizes and shapes are used
in a chemistry lab. There are tubes, vials, beakers, ﬂasks, pipettes,
and retorts. (A retort is also a snappy comeback, such as “Oh, yeah!"
or “So’s your old man!” 1

(Perhaps the most famous retort ever made was delivered by none
other than Noah Webster himself. Itseems that one day Mr. Web-
ster’s wife walked unexpectedly into Mr. Webster’s otﬁce and found

Mr. Webster’s secretary sitting on Mr. Webster's knee. “Why Mr. I

Webster!” cried Mr. _Webster’s wife. “I am surprised!” .
(“N o, my dear,” he replied. “I am surprised. You are astonished."
(Well, sir, it must be admitted that old Mr. Webster ot off a

good one, but still one can not help wishing he had spent ess time

triﬂing with his secretary, and more time working on his diction’-

iary. Many of his deﬁnitions show an appalling want of scholarship.

Take, for instance, what happened to me not long ago. I went to the
dictionary to look up “houghband” which is a band that you pass

around the leg and neck of an animal. At the time I was planning ’

to pass bands around the legs and necks of some animals, and I

wanted to be sure I ordered the right thing. I
(Well sir, thumbing through the H’s in the dictionary, I hap-

pened to come across “horse.” And this is how Mr. Webster deﬁnes

' “horse”--“a large, solid hoofed herbivorous mammal, used as‘a

draft, animal.”

(Now this, I submit, is just plain sloppiness. The most cursory
investigation would have shown Mr. Webster that horses are not
mammals. Mammals give milk. Horses do not give milk. It has to be
taken from them under the most severe duress.

(Nor is the horse a draft animal, as Mr. Webster says. Man is a
draft animal.wMr. Webster obviously had the cavalry in mind, but
even in the cavalry it is men who are drafted. Horses volunteer.)

But I digress. We were discussing chemistry. I have told you the
most important aspects, but there are many more——far too many
to cover in the space remaining here. However, I am sure that there
is a ﬁne chemistry lab at your verycwn college. Wh don't you go up
some afternoon and poke around? Make a kind of un day out of it.
Bring ukeleles. Wear funny hats. Toast frankfurters on the Bunsen

burners. Be gay, be merry, be loose, for ‘chemistry is your friend! ,

‘Experience Factor

Football squad with the accent pn personnel.)

Experience could very easily turn into the deciding factor

when it comes down to picking

for the next edition of the Panther grid eleven. .

In a talk with ‘assistant coach Steve Petro who has been
handling the guards during their ﬁrst week of spring drills,
it developed that so far——withfjust ﬁve days of practice to
go on——it’s pretty hard to separate any standouts.

Naturally in a rundown of thee
guards, one must first consider
Al Bolkovac and Harold Hunter

However, as Petro pointed out,
“Anyone can sit the bench if he’s

The main competition for these
two holdovers is being provided
by Vince Scorcone and Dan Wis-

Schmidt and Bob Kiesel and.
freshmen John Guizek, Dick Carr,
Frank Benke, and Joe Michael.

JOHN CENCI
. Co-captain ﬁnds competition
an air =1: ‘ '

right now, Cummins feels that the
fight for the snapper—back post
is a three-way tie with last -year’s
regular John Cenci, fighting it out
with Ed Bose, who saw almost as
much action last year, and soph
Chuck Brueckman. Cenci is this
year’s co-captain.

Rounding out the center candi-
dates are soph Jim Sabitini and-’
junior Frank Cicero.

Even though Cummins feels the
job is a three-way battle, it’s
probable that Cenci would get the
nod if only on that basis of hav-
ing been the starter last season.

Brueckman, the third competi-
tor, 1s acclaimed by Cumminsto
be the best of the three, defen-
sively. Although Brueckman did
not get into action last fall, Cum-
mlns feels that the McKees Rocks
footballer has enough. experience.
Brueckman was an end while a

The Aggies tallied 40 points to
take team honors for the
umpteenth time, with Penn State
showing 31, Pitt (28, Lehigh 2-5,
Oklahoma Univ. 24, and Michigan

Three of the locals lost out in

Ed DeWitt lost via a referee’s

Seasoned Ohio Staters Host
Panther Baseballers Friday

By AL

PELAEZ

The Panther mitters may not go to spring training in
Florida like Ohio State does, but they’ll still be ready for their
season’s opener with the Buckeyes this Friday.

Ohio State has already played seven games in the south-

land and will be at a distinct advantage because of this..

Coach Bobby Lewis, however,‘

thinks his mitters, “Are in good
shape and should fare well in the
three game series with the Buck-
eyes.”

With the first game only a few
days off, the Panther lineup is

‘pretty well set. Jim Mazur will

open at first with Ken Krapf at
second, Dick Lepkowski at short
stop, and John Jacobs at third to
round out the inﬁeld.

Lettermen Tom Bigley in left

and Harry Little in center along

with footballer Bill Schmidt in
right will compose the outﬁeld.

The startingbattery will con-
sist of Milt Emery behind the
plate and, in all probability, Dan
Miller ‘on the mound. Other pitch-
ers scheduled to see action in the
Columbus series are Bob Barrick-

You get deep-down smoking enjoyment from Luckies because
they taste better. Why do they taste better? That’s easy to
fathom. First of all, Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. Then,
that tobacco is toasted to taste better. “It’s Toasted”-the
famous Lucky Strike process—tones up Luckies’ light, mild,

fresher, smoother. So, when it’s light-up time, light up the
