lcarcli Heads
lA Group;
Plisclincr VP

At its first meeting of the sem-
ester, last Friday, Independent as-
sociation elected new officers and
made preparations for the annual
membership drive which started
this morning. New officers are Aldo
Ijcardi, C43, president; Paul Pﬁsch-
ner, C44, vice-president; Margaret
Holland, C44, secretary; and Jack
Ellis, C44. treasurer.

Immediately after the balloting,
newly elected president Icardi, in
his ﬁrst official act, appointed Ed-
ward Byers, C44, chairman of the
membership campaign.

According to Icardi, committee-
men of the membership drive will
assist students to register in the
Independent association at a'booth
established on the ground ﬂoor,
Cathedral. Icardi urged all non-
fraternity men and women to ap-
ply for their membership card at
the booth as soon as possible. A
membership fee of 25 cents will be
required:

Membership entitles students to
participate in all Independent so-
cial and educational functions, said
Chairman Edward Byers. He asked
that all students in the College,
ﬂue School of Education, and the
School of Business Administration
to obtain their cards today. Engi-
neers and Pre-Education students
are asked to secure their cards to-
morrow.

; Following themembership cam-
paign discussion, Icardi outlined
the tentative social program for
the year. According to Icardi, Inde-

~penden/t. association will sponsor

again this year a dance or a party,
expressly for independents. He
added that arrangements are being
made at the moment «for a joint
‘glance with Tech on the date of the
Inter-Fraternity Winter carnival.

It seems hopeless to try to tell you what it is like to
be hungry. You, to whom hunger is something that somes
about the end of the fourth hour and is gone by the beginning
of the sixth.

But this winter, unless something is done to prevent it,
hundreds of thousands of people (about ten Pitt stadiums,
crammed full) are going to die of starvation——no food.

In Greece, where the death rate is over 500 a day, at
least half the population will die this winter of hunger——
if something isn’t done to stop it.

In Norway two and a quarter million out of a population
totalling three million are suffering from malnutrition—~
they haven’t got enough to eat. And the Quisling government
has said outright that it doesn’t care if thousands of Norwe-
gians starve this winter. They will starve if something isn’t

Just twenty-ﬁve cents will
send the last edition of the “Pan-
ther” to any army camp or naval
‘station in the world. Irving Lei-
Iber, BA44, advertising manager,

' 'announced that the supply of ex-

tra “Panthers” is limited. Those
who want to bring a reminder of
school life to Pitt students now
in the service ‘had better hurry
[to put in their order, he said.
' No proﬁt will be made by the
“Panther,” theentire returns go-
ing to pay for the necessary
postage. The Panther office on
the eighth floor will stay open
every afternoon this week to
take orders.

War Bulletins Posted
D<£M0«rder of Artus
of Artus, honorary eco-

nomics fraternity, has prepared the
ﬁrst of a series of weekly bulletins
whose purpose is to inform the
students concerning the primary
economic issues of the war. Copies
will be posted on the bulletin
boards throughout the school.

done. i

In Belgium, conditions are said to be “as bad, if not

worse, than in Greece.”

In Holland, the food ration was cut still lower last week,
and in Poland, each citizen gets about one-fourth as much
to eat as he got at thebeginning of the war. Already 700,000
(that’s just less than the the population of Pittsburgh) have
starved. More will die, if something isn’t done. ‘

And it is within the power of all of us to do something.
We, the students, can’t really decide on the major issues of
this war. We can and should-iwork for a second front to end
Europe’s misery——but the ﬁnal word on this must still come -

from those above us.

But to give to the United War Fund-—to give double-
this is something that wecan do. It is -more than this. It is —

something that we must do. 4 .

Expect $2 Pledge
From Students

“Let’s go Pitt . . ."

That is the battle cry for
the campus campaign of the
United War Fund this year.
The aim is to have “a Uni-
versity we're all proud of.” Every
student must “give double" in or-
der to achieve that aim.

Third hour tomorrow and Thurs-
day have been set aside as the
times to make pledges. Student
speakers will address classes meet-
ing at those times on the purpose
and advantages of the War Fund.
A two—dollar ple(lg‘<= expected
from every student.

“This is the lirst War Fund
campaign since our entrance into
the war,” said Harold Gondel-
man, chairman of the drive on
campus, “surely everyone will
cooperate this year when so
much of the money will be used
to benefit those close to us.”

is

A large percentage of’ the intake
will stay here on campus to be
used by the YWCA, YMCA, Men's
Loan Fund, Women's Loan Fund,
and Pitt-in-China. Still another
portion will go to the USO.

“Pitt has a record to be proud
of——and to maintain,” continued

Gondelman. “Last year, we went"
over our quota; let's do the same‘

this year. Let's go Pitt.”

Already the School of Dentis-
try and the School of Pharmacy
have voted’ to participate 100 per
cent. They are taking the money
out of their breakage fees.

“Your parents have already do-
nated; this is meant to be YOUR
contribution,” stated Theodore Bid-

dle, Dean of Men and faculty man I  L

in charge of the drive.

Two red feathers, an auto "stick-
er, and Pitt’ tag will be given to
each person who contribute: lio-
morrow or Thursday.

'Best Foot Forward’

Opens At Nixon

Surrounded by beautiful women
and that popular “‘-Bu_ckle Down
Winsocki,” Nixon Theatre this
week presents Broadway’s rollick-
ing musical comedy hit, “Best Foot
Forward.”

George Abbott, famed for such
productions as “Three Men on a
Horse,” “Too Many Girl s ,”
“Brother Rat,” and “Pal Joey,” is
the producer of this gaily youthful
show. The New York cast is headed
‘-by Joy Hodges, who has appeared
in many Hollywood ﬁlms, and
Marty May, stage and radio zoome-
dian. Pittsburgh’s Audrey 
is among the many young and tal-
ented performers of the play.

“Best Foot Forward” tells the
story -of the hilarious oomp‘lic9.-tiorns
created by a Hollywood -star when
she attends .a prom at a strictly dis-
ciplined -boys" school in PeImsyl-
vania. Her unexpected personal ap-
pearance lbrings delight to most of
the students, but consternation to
the straight-laced faculty.

Fright thousand eyes followed the broken ﬁeld travel-

ney up in the press box, made snide remarks about penalties
for backﬁeld in motion.

Then the Techs really got hot. In one ﬁery last minute
stand against what they knew to be superior forces, the Tar-
tans lit a torch——symbol of liberty. But no one was 1300 im-
pressed with this revival of the ancient Statue of Liberty play,
the rain being generally unconducive to torch lighting.

Now it was Pit1’s turn. With far more strength and

Cathedral lads high-stepped their way to mid-ﬁeld before
‘being stopped. Somebody said something about a naked re-

Then, using a 110 man front wall, the Pitt’s stormed the
left side line where they advanced the rest of the ﬁeld into the
Tartan end zone.
Back down the ﬁeld-—over the goal line another time——
and it was all over for the Pitt Band.

. Impressive as they looked, Sa.turda.y’s performance was
tut a breather—a warm up for this Week-end’s showing
against the all-American Ohio State band.

Despite the fact that Pitt was
swamped by Minnesota 50-7 in their
opening game, they seemed to have
a better club than that score indi-
cated. Against SMU they showed
they ' rere capable of playing good
football and won 20-7. In losing the
next week to Great Lakes 7-6 the
Panthers were at their best. What
has happened since then, however,

has caused the followers of the Blue"

While. Indiana was favored to
beat them, the Bowsermen showed
that they had lost some of their zip

the mediocre Southern eleven
trounced them 28-0. Last week

against Tech, the Panthers ail

have shown a s'tron,g, consistently

Throughout City Schools

Since the opening of the Penny Exchange booth last Wednesday,

over 20,000 more
Pitt Penny plan.

Fifty _thousand old pennies had_

been exchanged by, Friday and re-
turned to circulation. ‘
According to Dr. J. Ellwood
Amos, associate professor of ii-
nance, the purpose is to return
idle pennies to‘ circulation and
thus cut down the number of
pennies that must be minted
each month. This will reduce the
amount of vital copper which
must be used by the mint.
Under the direction of commit-
tee co-chairman Lila Greer, Rob-
ert Widmere, and Melvin Penner,

‘freshman business administration

students, are in charge of the ex-
change booth and collecting the
pennies.

One student alonye brought in
13,325 pennies and a former stu-
dent exchanged 4,072 pennies.

The campaign has already be-
gun to spread in Pittsburgh.

Sincethe downtown papers car- .

ried the story of the campaign,
district banks reported people
have come to them with pennies
to, exchange. Several of the city
high schools are planning to con-
duct campaigns too.

Dr. Amos would like other
schools in the Universityto form
committees to assist -the BA com-
mittee;
