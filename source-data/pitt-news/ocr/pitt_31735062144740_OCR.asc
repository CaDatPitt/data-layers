Held Last Semester; Gives
Students Idea of College.

FROSH MEET’ ADVISORS

Attend Conferences, Mixer
Dance and Luncheon
Yesterday

 

 

Freshman Day, an innovation at
Pitt, was held yesterday for 150 new
students who are registering in the

University for the ﬁrst time. Its
aim, like that of Freshman Week
last semester, was to give new stu-
dents a perspective of college from
the faculty’s point of view.
Freshman Week last semester
proved so successful that the com-
mittee, Helen Rush, assistant to the
dean of women, and C. R. Wilson,
assistant .0 the dean of men, planned
a similar program for yesterday. A
general assembly in the banquet
room of Memorial Hall in the morn-

- ing, after which there were confer-

ences for both the men and women,
opened yesterday's program.

The men met with W. Don Har-
rison, dean of men, at 10:30 o’clock.
This conference lasted until 11:30
o’clock at which time the men were
entertained at luncheon in Faculty
club. Members of Student Council,
each of whom will act as adviser to

» a group of freshmen, were also

present.

The women’s conference began_at
12:30 o’clock in Heinz house, with
Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women in charge. Presidents of
women's organizations on the
campus, explained to freshmen girls
about life at Pitt, and the new
women were divided into seven

roups, each group holding a con-

erence with its senior mentor be-
fore luncheon. Senior mentors are
Ruth Matteson, Dorothy Koch, Daine
Waggaman, Charlotte McMurray,
Ruth Cheney, Anne Goedecke, and
Mary Reeser. .

All the. new freshmen took intel-
ligence tests yesterday afternoon,
and last night 0. D. K. and Mortar
Board, national honorary activities
fraternities, sponsored a mixer party
for freshmen men and women at
Heinz house. ’

PITT DEDATEIIS ENGAGE
IN CONTEST THURSDAY
Meet Oberlin College Team

On Question Of Foreign
Investments

Pitt men debaters will engage in
their fourth intercollegiate debate of
the season when they meet Oberlin
college of Ohio, next Thursday even-
ing in the auditorium of the Frick
Teachers’ Training school.

Robert F. Youn , Col. ’28; A. E.
Leven and C. J. hillips, both Col.
'30, have been named by Professor
W. M. Parrish, ‘coach, to represent
Pitt. This team will take the af-
firmative of the question, “Resolved,
that the United States Government
should not protect by force of arms
the private investments of its citi-
zens in foreign countries.”

In continuance of the ﬁrst semes-
ter extension debate program, an
extension debate, will be held at the
North Side Community House on
Tuesday evening, on the subject of
the protection of foreign invest-
ments, according to Prof. Parrish.

During the ﬁrst semester eleven
members of the men’s debating as-
sociation took part in eight debates,
three of which were intercollegiate,
with Washington and Jefferson Col-
lege, Penn State and Western Re-
serve University of Cleveland. The
extension debates were held at
Johnstown junior college, Schenley,
McKeesport and Canonsburg high

before the_Philadelp},Iia club at the
Roosevelt notel.

WILL SELECT FUTURE
EDUCATION STUDENTS
ON MEDICAL BASIS

Schools of education and teachers’
colleges in the future_ will select
their students on the same basis as

medical schools select our future
physicians, predicts Dr. Q . .
Rohrbach, head of the department of
history and principles of education,
in an editorial in the current number
of The Open Book, magazine of Kap-
pa Phi Kappa, national honorary fra-
ternity in- education.

Dr. Rohrbach expresses the belief
that if a school enrolls a student for
four years of teachers’ training, that
school should be held accountable for
its product. If a considerable per-

 

‘ centage of the graduates of .a school

are rejected for positions by‘ edu-

cators, it is a serious indictment

against that school, he believes.
With eight hundred" thousand stu-

‘ dents‘ enrolled’ in -higher institutions

of learning, about four million in the
secondary. schools, and-about..tweuty..
one million in the elementary schools,
approximately twenty per cent of the
population is going to school. Be-
cause of the large number of
students, teaching will be the profes-
sion that claims the most numerous
group of pra-ctioners, he states.
“Real 'me'rit,”“ Dr.‘ Rohrbach says,
“Will be the criterion for selection.
Unawareness of candidates of the
common criteria that school oﬁicials
consider in theselection of person-
nel, amazes us in our contacts with
teacher “placement” work.” I

The growing army of students in

all schools throughout the country I

shows that higher standards must
necessarily be set for those planning
for the teaching profession, says Dr.
Rohrbach. _

A list of twelve criteria for select-
ing teachers, stated by Dr. Rohrbach,
are:

“1——Does the applicant have
physical and mental vigor and en-
durance?

“2—~Is he alert?

“3—Is he sympathetic?

“4-—-Does he have a winning per-
sonality?

“5-—Does he possess the qualities
of leadership, breadth, outlook, cour-
age, industry, and the capacity to
serve? .

“6—Is he capable of depth and
breadth of scholarship and how ar
has he come in its attainment in is
ﬁeld?

“7-—-Are his views and tastes
marked by catholicity?

“8-—Do his actions reﬂect culture
and reﬁnement?

“9--Has he the ability to think
far in a straight line—to think a
thing through?

“10.—-Does he use good English
with facility?

“11—Does he give evidence of the
exercise of good common sense?

“12-—-Does he evidence a sense of
the ﬁtness of things?”

Feel Need For School In ‘Stage Coach’ .
Days; Foundations Laid For University

This is the ﬁrst of a. series of articles concerning thr early his-
tory of Pitt, designed to acquaint the student body with the -real
signiﬁcance of Charter Day, to be celebrated February 28, in com-

memoration of the founding of the

When Pittsburgh was a trading
settlement of only a few hundred
people in the Golden Triangle of to-
day, stage coaches, boats and pack
horses the only means of transpor-
tation, and log cabins solved the
housing problem, the need was felt
among the people of this district for
some form of school to supplement
home instruction. Accordingly, the
legislature was petitioned for a
charter for the establishment of
such a school, and on February 28,
1787, the Pennsylvania legislature
granted a charter for the “estab-
lishment in the town of Pittsburgh
of an academy for the education of
the youth in useful arts, sciences and
literature.”

The agitation for the establish-
ment of the “Pittsburgh Academy"
was led by Judge Hugh Henry
Breckenridge, a Princeton graduate,
and was furthered through the edi-
torial columns of the Pittsburgh
Gazette, Pittsburghs first newspa-
per, that was itself founded only a.

University.

The first Academy building was a
log abin, erected at what is now
the corner of Third avenue and
Cherry alley, the year after the
granting of the charter. There is
not In existence any illustration of
the Academy structure, .but an ap-
proximation of it can be gained by
visiting the log cabins built during
that time, still in existence in the
Pittsburgh district. The most well
known are the Block House on the
Point, and the old Forsythe home on
the corner of Penn and Ne ley ave-
nues, although there are ot er more
representative samples in the dis-
trict. Drawing a composite of the
structure, it was probably one story
high, had a ﬁreplace at either end
and one door in the center of the
front wall. It was built of rough
logs, bark chopped off, and ends
sawed square, that were mortised
one on top of another. The ‘cracks
were calked with clay. ’

Research into the early history of
the Academy is handicapped by the

NEW PLAN OF MINES
SCHOOL WILL ALLOW
MID - YEAR ENTRANCE

High school students graduating in
February may now enter the schools
of engineering and mines immediate-
ly upon graduation and complete the
four year course in three and a half
years by special schedule arrange-
ment which Dr. E. A. Holbrook, dean
of the schools, has just completed.
The special arrangement was made
for the beneﬁt of those graduating
in February, who would, under the
old_ arrangement, be compelled to
wait until fall to begin their college
work. *

Dr. Holbrook has received favor-
able comment on the new plan from
high school principals who declare
that many of their students are
anxious to complete the requirements
for a degree in the three and a half
years alioted by the special schedule
arrangement.

Under the new arrangement, the
student takes the same amount of
paid co-operative work that is given
the student taking the regular
schedule.

OPPOSE ENTERING
INTER - COLLEGIATE
GLEE COMPETITION

Pitt will not enter the second an-
nual state intercollegiate glee club
contest ‘scheduled for Carnegie Music
Hall this month, announces John R.
Johnston, graduatemanager of stu-
dent activities. An invitation issued
to Pitt to enter its men’s glee. club
has been declined.

Decision to decline entrance in the
state contest,_ the winner of which
will compete in a national glee club
contest in New York in March, was
made when it became known that
contesting clubs would be permitted
to enter approximately thirty men
each. Reluctance to reduce the num-
ber_ of members in the A» Pitt club,
which numbers over sixty members,
in order to be eligible. for competi-
ticon led to the decision, states J ohn--

PITT WOMEN MORE CARELESS THAN
MEN; LOSE THREE TIMES AS MUCH

at State Teachers College, Indiana.

Women are more careless than
men; at any rate, Pitt girls lose
about three times. as many things
as men, states James Harkins, head
of the Lost and Found Department
at the University.

“And besides, they are more dif-
ﬁcult to get along with and more of
a bother than men,” Mr. Harkins
says. During his experience with
the department, he _has found that
women who come to him to claim
lost articles sometimes create a fuss
when told that a particular object
has not been turned in. “I some-
times wonder whether they don’t
trust us,” he remarks. “A few days
ago a girl who could not receive an
umbrella because she could not give
a description of it reported the mat-
ter to the business manager.

Mr. Harkins receives‘ more books
than any other lost articles, al-
though gloves, scarfs, notebooks and
compacts are received. Even money

PROFESSOR MONTFORD
JONES IS NAMED ON
CURRENCY COMMITTEE

Professor Montford Jones. profes-
sor of finance in the school of busi-
ness administration and chairman of
the banking committee of the Na-
tional Credit Men’s association, has
been appointed a member of the
United States assay commission by
President Coolidge. The commis-
sion, which will examine coins re-
served from last year’s output of
United States mints, meets in Phila-
delphia.

The assay commission, composed
of the judge of the district court of
eastern Pennsylvania, the comp-
troller of the currency, the assayer
of the United States office at New
York and other appointees, annual-
ly checks the accuracy of the mints,
determining whether gold and silver
coins vary within the limits of

is sometimes brought to the depart-
ment. After a year's time, un-
claimed articles are thrown away,
but books after two years are trans-
ferred to the book store. _Mr. Har-
kins was unable to say whether they
were sold or not. '

In previous years when a student
came to claim something,’ the men
in the department. pulled out all the
gloves, for instance, and allowed
him to look through them. Some-
times, itcwas found, he picked out a
good pair of gloves, even though
they were not ‘s own. Now, how-
ever, a description of the article is
required before it is shown.

Since the Lost and Found Depart-
ment was removed from Room 1,
State hall last fall, fewer claimants
have called at the department. The
reason, state the men in charge, is
that few persons are acquainted
with the present location of the de-
partment at the rear of State hall.

SSS-I STUDENTS ARRANGE
SEMESTER’S SCHEDULES
IN PRE-REGISTRATION

New Process Is ‘Expected to
I Shorten Considerably Time
of Registration Period.

GREATER SPEED IS AIM

Regular Registration Period
Ends This Saturday

Evening

 

Following a period of pre-regis-
tration, during which 588 students
arranged second semester schedules,
regular registration for the second
semester of 1927-28 began promptlg
this morning at Syria Mosque and

will continue through a period of ‘

three days until noon Saturday.
Pre-registration, the new registra-
tion system introduced last semes-
ter, has been continued during mid-
year -registration. This system has
provided for the arranging of stu-

lat’ registration and the reservation
of.'..class coupons upon so doing.
This‘: process is-expected to shorten
tlki)c1a<,«time of registration consider-
a ‘ I . _ .
“It is the aim of the University,”
says Registrar J . G. Quick, “to speed
up registration so as to cut down
the time necessary from three days
at mid-year to one day, and from
one week in September to three
days.” ’

Mr. Quick further explained that
although the number of students pre-
registering is but a small part of
the total enrollment of the student
body, results shown are still a. fair
indication of the success of the ex-
periment, when it is considered that
only those who are carrying the
same schedules through the second
semester are allowed to pre-register
and that pre-registration is in the
experimental stage. The registrar
suggested the advisability of stu-
dents adhering to their original
schedules if they would simplify the
registration process.

r. Quick also announced that
school association booths will be
separated from the registration zone
because of the impression formerly
given‘ new students that joining the
associations was an obligatory part
of registration. Where formerly
these booths were located before the
treasurer’s booth, they will now be
located in the vicinity of the exits.
The .change was decided upon, ac-
cording to the registrar, after a con-
ference of‘ the deans of the different

rIl‘1V.E been mailed to students in the
undergraduate schools and the down-
town , division. The cards were
-placed in the mails Tuesday after-
noonso as to insure their reaching
their destination before registration.

BEAUTY IN GRAIN
ELEVATORS, SILOS

Taking as his theme, "An Ameri-
can Miscellany,” Carl Sandburg,
oet, journalist, prose writer and
musician, spoke at the Y. M.-Y. W.
H. A. Tuesday in a program of read-
ings and songs.

In speaking of the personal view-
point and taste in poetry, the lec-
turer explained that “what was let-
tuce to some is poison ivy to others.”
To his mind, there is more “bunk”
and illusion in the ﬁeld of art than
in any other ﬁeld of endeavor.
poet saw.more beauty in silos and
grain elevators of the country be-
cause of their simplicity than in
most ofthe supposedly great works
of architecture. .

The rogram was given over to a
repertoire of songs from S_andburg’s
own collection, “The American Song
Bag,” with the. poet playing his own
accompaniment on the guitar. Songs
of the American pioneers, songs of
the railroaders and hoboes of forty
years ago, ballads of Tennessee

mountaineers, cowboy songs, and
Negro spirituals were all included in
the recital. -

Laws Of Science Apply to -
‘Says Maude Royden,—- English Preacher

Religion;

That the laws of science apply to,
and do not detract from, religion, is
the opinion of Miss Maude Royden,
famous English preacher and writer,
as stated in an address on “Psychol-
ogy and Religion,” Tuesday evening
in Carnegie Music Iiall.

The natural scientist of the nine-
teenth century believed in something
he did not expect to prove; yet by
testing and experience he proved the
truth of his belief. As a result, he
learned that all things in the uni-
verse are governed by unchangeable
laws, said the speaker.

“So it is with religion,” stated
Miss Royden. “Christ, Who may be
com ared to the scientist, believed
abso utely in God, our Father, simtplly
by believing, and preaching, and o -
lowing this creed. He made it the
essence of Christianity. In other
words, He proved it to be true; and
the truth in Christ’s’ doctrine can
be illustrated in the fact that the
whole world has been changed by it.’

Miss Royden further stated that
the laws of psychology, instead of
leaving pessimism and helplessness
in the minds of human bein s, give
the keynote to obtaining t e true

If we suggest to ourselves that God
is love, we will develop a strong
faith in His creed. Furthermore,
psychologists have proved that love
assimilates love; and if our religion
-teaches us to believe in the love
of God, we can grow in the example
of Christ. “Whatever you worship
carves on your spirit the image of
what you love,” said Miss Royden.
“Not how we came to talk of God,
but are we believing something that
is true-——that is the vital thing in
religion,” Miss Royden stated. “Psy-
chology helps us to determine wheth-
er we are suggesting to_ourselves
a lie and insane fanaticism or a
truth. That psychology distinguishes
between lunacy and religion is evi-
denced throughout the insane asy-

lums. In addition, the experience of .

thousands with their belief that they
are the children of God has brought
them strength, bravery and se-
renity.” _
Miss Royden, who is in the United
States on the ﬁrst stage of a world
lecture tour, spoke in Pittsburgh
under the auspices of the Central
branch of the Y. W. C. A. The lec-
ture was presented as part of the
course in general knowled9:e offered

with a smile on his face.

“Joe” Thompson was one of the
guest heroic and “icturesquo char-
lcters in University history. His
ability to inspire men was uncanny.
Starting out in life as a c enter,
he never rested until his lfelO;t13'
ambition to get to college was re‘ --
iced. His deep, love for all branches
of athletics proved a great factor

' doterminin. his career, and he
- I: one o the best known eth-
tes and coaches of his day. “Joe”
was a. ﬁghter himself, and admired
a. ﬁghter. He loved to match
strength and wit in‘ athletic combat
ellow, and he had
the determination which usually
brought him out ahead.
Started As a Carpenter

“.Toe” started his athletic activities
as a member of the old East Lib-
arty Y. M. C. A. Working every
day as a carpenter, he spent his
1 are time and evenings developing
himself physically, and he bee

School was closely associated with
in those days of the middle

the ﬁne points‘ of track " its in
which branch of athletics e Ilean
was a star. “Joe," he tells us, was
I fellow who learned quickly, and a
ow ‘years later he was one of the
an 5 stiffest competitors. ‘Dr.

Finally the opportunity‘ come for

was bitterly fought, “Joe” A loose
for whats,-nppenred like a cent field
and the winning touchdown. Some-
one tackled him and it is a question
to this day whether a regular W. &
J. or a substitute on the canon.
Helped Start “Big” Football Here
In 1903 "Joe" came to the Uni-
versity and started an epoch of “big”
football, which grew from the days
of Exposition ark in Allegheny,
with its crowds of 5,000, to the days
of the immense l°itt stadium, where
a crowd has to be 50,000 or 60,000
to be called "bi .” ‘Joe” had al-
woys predicted t at this da would
come, and he was right. it also
often made the prediction that the
annual game between Pitt and Car-
negie would grow and grow, and
would eventually become the big
guns in the city of Pittsburgh. This
also a. rediction which seems sure
to be tea ized.
The first great football victory for
the University was over Penn State
lege Ill 1904. State that year
had an outstanding team, and they
had always lorded it over the W. U.
P. boys and outclassed them in iti-
ful fashion. The team, captains by

Was‘Coach Four Years

“Joe” returned later to the Uni-
versity aa head’ football coach, di-
recting the teams of 1909, 1910, 1911-
and 1912. He met with remarkable
success, and his 1910 team was the
outstanding oneof the country, not
a single point being scored by op-
géinents, includingﬂtate, W. 6: J

est Virginia, Georgetown, Cor-
negie Tech and other strong com-
petitors. “Tex” Richards, fullback
was the super-star of that tearn, an
"Joe” always contended that he has
never had a superior in Pitt football.

It is, perhaps, superﬂuous to say
many words about “Joe’s” war rec-
ord, as it is a household word.
Everyone knows how he went “Over
There" and fought just as he had
in football, to make the world safe
for democracy. He was, perhaps,
the most loved officer in the"‘entire
A. E. F. He could be ap roached

Won Many War Honors

“Joe” came home with many
wounds, which eventually contrib-
uted to his death. He was one of
the relatively small number of sol-
diers in the whole United State: who
was awarded the Congressional
Medal of Honor, conferred upon him
in Washington, . C., in 1922.
France had already decorated him
with the_Croix dc Guerra, England
with the British Medal of Honor, and
the United States with the Distin-
guished Service Cross. ‘

After the war “Joe” took 3 ram!-
nent port in looking after t e in-
terests of the soldiers. In 1922 he
was elected State Commander of the
American Legionvund always -toolé a
very active interest in its affairs.
One of the originators of the Legion
in Paris, he was a prime mover in
the post-war athletic contests held
in France. Upon his return for a
furlou h in 1919, he helped to choose
the at letes who participated in the
Inter-Allied meet in Paris that year.
Fifty men were chosen for this moot
who 1: _ been in the service, one of
them bem “Jock” Sutherland, prel-
ent Pitt ootbell coach, who com-
peted in the weight events. Before
the Armistice, in addition to his
military duties, he was Athletic Di-
rectlorpost the Second Army of the

“Joe” graduated from the College
in 1905 and then attended the Law

true

E‘ School, class of 1908. He received

his A.M. Degree in 1911. After
graduation he took an active part
in the Alumni organization, being at
one time president of the General
Alumni Association. He also did
much, as an alumnus, to advance
the University’: athletic interests.
Through his personal and until-ing
efforts. the ﬁrst football ame with
the University of Penney vania was
arranged in 1915.

"Joe" was buried with full mili-
tary honor: last Friday; funeral
services bein held in his ate home,

DEATHS

J. E. Bumbera, Phar. '12. Death
claimed a well known ﬁgure in Pitt
circles when Joseph E. Bumbera,
Phar. '12, passed away suddenly
Wednesday, January 25. “J oe" had
been in apparently good health. and
had gone to work that morning» He
became ill at noonvand was taken to’
his home, where he died“ during the
night.

“Joe” Bumbera was one of those
big-hearted fellows who made
friends, and who was alwa s doing
something for somebody e se. He
was an unselﬁsh fellow who seemed
to love putting himself out for the

tterment of someone else He was
an ardent supporter of eve ' g
that related to Pitt, especia y the
athletic activities. A fooball“ game
or any athletic contest was not com-
plete unless “Joe” was there, and
he usually planned to take the trips
with the athletic teams, where he
was always welcome. The boys
liked to have “Joe” along, because
he was an optimist and a ﬁghter for
Pitt, and a mighty good, congenial
companion.

“J oe” graduated from the Phar-
macy School in the class of 1912 and
for many years conducted drug
stores in the Swissvale district. He

fornia, Pa., at the time of his death.
Recently he was engaged as a bond
salesman for the Henry L. Doherty
Company, and he was making good
with a vengeance, due to his per-
sonality and enthusiasm.

Another hobby of “Joe’s” was the
Pitt Band. As a student, he had
been a member of the band, playing
the snare drum. Only this past
season, when the drum section of
the band seemed a little weak, he
volunteered to help out. Few people
recognized the young looking fellow
in a Pitt Band uniform as Bumbera,

John Spencer Bassett and Clarence Wal-

historians. Perhaps their claim to interest ’

(and this claim is merited by a shamefully
small number of historians) lay in their un-
quenchable desire to present history with con-
viction and truth, contrary to the samples of
the patriotic Mayor Thompson.

We have Mr. Bassett to thank for many en-
lightening treatises on the South, where he was
born and brought‘ up. He contributed several
volumes on the history of slavery in North
Carolina, he wrote an important life of Andrew
Jackson, and _recently he was engaged with an
edition of «Jackson's letters in six volumes.

came, through his contributions, one of our
v.grea_test sectional historians.

BAUER-GABRILOWITSCH
AROLD BAUER and Os-
sip Gabrllowitach gave
us, last Friday night in

‘ Carnegie Music Hall, s. recital

which was the nearest to per-
fect recital we have heard in
Pittsburgh tor the last two or
three years.

The musicians, their playing
teehuleslly ‘impeccable, were
vividly contrasting in manner.
Bauer is always the impetuous
adventurer. while Gabrilo-
witsch is the sensuous roman-
tic. The consequence of their
ability to" co-operate was a mu-
sic thst had much at the “di-
vine? use” in it. Had it not
been that "one does not. do such

' in -America, we would
have stood up and cheered-—
but according to convention, we
merely applauded. If the evi-
dence--s. pert 0! it. at les.st—~

‘ could have had. its way, the en-

tire program would have been

repeated.‘ .
Bach's Concertoin C Minor,
Mr. B eu‘s!"s' arrangement,

opened the-p!'ogre.m. Here was
s,’Bsch that was no pedsnt, no
creaky old man writing tire-
some exercises for weary ﬁn-
gers, but 9. living force that
awakened even the most ego-

’ tllticll member of the audience.

Mozart's Sonata in D Major,
the second’ number on the pro-
gram. was always bright and
sparkling with characteristic
Moaartian gent_l_enes_s. The Pres-
too! the sonata was repeated
at the insistent demands of the
audience. a

The second half of the pro-
mm was modern, consisting of

SaintkSa.en’s Variations on a.
" Theme by Beethoven, an Im-

provisation on themes of Schu-
msnu by Rsiuscke, and Aren-
slsy’s" Romance and Waltz. The
Waltz, with its charming themes
and hsrmonizatiorns, was re-,

The Ninth or Choral asym-
phony is the finest of __Bee-
thoven’s achievements, ﬁnished
shortly before his death. With

his death came thobirth of the
superstition that composers in-

ninth symphony. It exists to
this day and a modern Rus-
sian, Misskowsky, will not
write a. ninth work because of
it. The choral section, the-ﬁnal
movement, is based on Schil-
lsr’s Ode to Joy and uses solo-
ists snd full chorus. Fraser
Gauge is the’ baritone soloist.

Gustav Holst’s Hymn of Jo-
_.eus._is_a choral in the modem

Holst. born in Chsltenhsm in ,
1874, is one of the prominent
younger British composers. The
Planets, and his Choral Hymns
from The Big Veda are known
in this country. Many of his
arrangements of‘ British folk?
songs are ‘widely sung. ‘ The
work to be sung at this con-

cert is basedon a text ts'keii”" M

from the apocryphal “Acts of
St. John” and, according to
Vaughn .Williems, is probably
a part of some early mystical
ritual dance. The chorus is
scored for full orchestra, or-
gan, two choirs, and semi-choir.
The Prelude is sung by the
semi-choir. in Latin and is
based on two plainsongs.' The
Hymn proper is sung" in Eng-
lish and is in dance rhythm.
The idea of dancing in connec-
tion with modern religion seems
strange, but reterringvto Have-
lock Ellis. we ﬁnd: “The very
idea. of dancing had a sacred
and mystical meaning to‘ the
early Christians, who meditated
profoundly on the text. -‘We .
have "piped unto you and we
have not danced.” .

STRONG LION FIVE
INVADES STADIUM
F OR ENGAGEMENT
TOMORROW NIGHT
Decisive Triumphs Over Tech

Stamps Penn State A:
Tough Foe

As a climax to this glorious week
of vacation that we who have passed

 

K.

 

the required number of credits are .

now enjoying, and merely another
game for the other loyal Plttites,
comes the Panther-Lion cage brawl
tomorrow night at the stadium. A
very ‘light practice session tonight is
the order for the Goldens after the
tussle across the park last night.

The Nittany squad which was so
famous last year until Elmer Liss-
felt and his faithfuls bumped them
83-27, is intact this year with only
one exception. Mike Hamas, who
captained the outfit last season, has
graduated and will appear at the
stadium in the role of assistant
coach for the Lions.

Presenting a formidable array
that has lost only to Penn and Syra-
cuse by narrow margins the Centre
Countians romise real op osition
for Carlson s men. Last wee Coach
I-Iermann’sl team showed their true
strength when they humbled our
neighbor Scotchmen 48-23.

The presence of two members of
State’s famous grid team on the

- Lion roster gives the contest an

added color. Johnny Roepke, State’:
all-American halfback, will probably
be seen at one of the forward posts
before the evening is over. Cy Lung-
ren, crack halfback, will air up
with Captain Whitey Von ieda at
the guard strongholds.

_ Six victories in eight starts is the
Lions record to date but the two de-
feats matter little to the invaders
when they lineup against the famous
Golden Panthers of basketball fame.
State opened their season with an
easy 49-20 advantage of Western
Maryland. Their next game found
them on the- short end of it 27-26
score at the hands,.of Syracuse, the
-same team the 1 Panthers walloped
on the stadium ﬂoor. After a 41-22
victory over Lebanon Valley, Coach
Hermann’s men lost 9. two-point de-
cision to Pen 23-21. Juanita was
swamped 53-18 and Gettysburg
dropped 54-29. These two wallop-
ing counts are very similar to the
huge scores that the Panthers have
been regularly ringing up. So the
ﬂI1'n0.I50;fl0l‘I‘0W ni ht promises to be
a free scoring estivity with an-
other‘ capacity crowd looking on.

The strain of playing last night
without a single minute of practice
beforehand ‘and just a short work-
out tonight may ilnd Carlson’: men
at atremendous disadvantage fac-
ing a savage, Lion that pla nly re-
members the 33-27 beating it was
subjected to last, year and still
smacking-its gobbling lips from the
sweetness of the 35-34' triumph it
later scored over the Panther the
same year. Although it is Coach

Hermann in place of Coach -Bezdoeic,-, that

who brought eleven sterlings to the
stadium several short months ago,
it will be another ﬁghting Nittany
outfit that invades the stadium to-'
morrow night.
T’ ‘Not only will the invaders be re-
rocious but they will be good at the
simple court sine. Delp, Reinhold,
Boil _,.Von N eds, Lungren. I-Iamas,
Roep e, are all old-timers ’
progress of State basketball. Their
decisive margin of victory over the
Tartans‘ last week is just a sample
of what they will show against
Coach Cliff Carlson’s men. .
Following the Penn State encoun-
.ter, the Panthers will take things
easy for a while, meeting Alleghen.
on the home court Wednesday. F0 -
lowing this tussle which may turn
out to be a real contest, for the
Meadville lads gave Wash-Jeff a

‘good beating several‘ days ago, Carl- ‘FY

son’: men will beginintensive-— train-

.-ing for the Notre Dame game Sat-

urday night, February 18. The game
with the Irish looms as the best
home game of the season.

Cagers M Triumph
Over Two Tough
New York Fives

Following their hard fought tri-
umph over a stubborn Army mule
last Saturday night, Coach Cliff
Carlson’s bouncers spent a. quiet
Sunday in the big city of New York
and then romped over to Hamilton
to bounce-a favored Colgate quintet
48-37. The 42-36 victory scored at

the expense of Army marked the
tenth consecutive win of the season

 

‘for the battling Goldens.

Taken by sur rise when the West
in the opening mo-
mental of the game to lead his men,
Coach Carlson soon cooled his men
off and for the remaining three
quarters they played their usual un-
beatable game. Army led at differ-
ent stages of the game but the fa-
mous Reed, Hyatt and Wrobleski
trio managed to put the encounter
on the right side of the score book.

Colgate proved rather easy for
the Panthers Monday night and a
48-37 score was run u . The home
team far outclasse t e Hamilton
ﬁve and from the opening whistle
the Panthers began a sweep that
was never halted until the closing
hang of the timers’ gun. - At the
half mark the Golden held a 23-16
lead, Paul Zehfuss having come
through with four spectacular two-
pliers.

Every player in the Panther sn-
tourage was given an opportunity
against the Colgate boys. Fisher,
Cohen and McMahon replaced Wrob-
leski, Zehfuss and Wunderlich dur-
ing the fray. The entire Panther
ﬁve turned forward to ring up 20
ﬁeld goals. Wrobleskie hooped 6
goals, Zehfuss 5, Hyatt 4, Reed 4,
.Wunderlich 1. Bickle, Colgate pivot

man, played best for the losers, cag-

ﬁve goals.

with the Ohio State relays aboutthe
middle of April. Shea will continue
his training school for the rookies,
but at the same time. he will see
. . .  . varsity
through still’ enough paces.

Shea emphasizes the fact that he
can use a lot more new candidates
this year, _for he will have a hard
time kee mg n the pace of the
baskeths and ootball teams- The

ARMY CONQUERORS INVADE  [
CARNEGIE POOL TOMORROW

Pitt swimmers, who by beating
the Army natators suddenly sprang
into the same athletic prominence
that the Golden gridders and court-
men are enjoying, will match strokes
with a comparatively weak Carnegie
Tech tank outfit in the Tartan pool
tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 o'clock.
This let-up tilt was originally billed
for tomorrow night, but has been
moved up because of the basketball
game in the evening.

_ Friday 1. week Coach _ Corr’s
speeders take a short trip, meeting
Wooster Friday afternoon and Notre
Dame“ Saturday night. While the
Irish courtmen are burning their rub-
ber soles to keep up with Carlson's
unbeatables, Pat Corr’s boys will be
taking a crack at one of the best
swim aggregations in the country
out at South Bend.

_ The racig, plunging and divin
tomorrow ternoon in the Scotc
pool promises. to be. interesting from
a Blue and Gold standpoint. It is a
known fact that the across-the-park
water do s are in practically the
same pro icsment as their basket-
ball team, which.-has t to win a
nine in six stsrtis.
and, the Panthers have one of the
best, if not the best, swimming teams
that ever wet suits for the good of
our university. Seven fast events

 ,,carded, and just. seven first
 loom"‘for vouﬂys-<Wright and

is cohorts.

At any rate, the meet. is carded
for 4:30 tom rrow afternoon and an
excellent cha co is offered Pitt stu-
dents to make it a com lete Pitt-
Tech day by invadin

swimming teams in the history of

Pitt.
Defeat Army

Gettin back to the triumph over
Army which was a pounding
for the Panther tankmen, 1: sure
ﬁlls any loyal Pittits with satisfac-
tion and pride to think that in one
week the tricky Panther gave the
bal Mule from the Army two
‘gen e pawings in the form of has-
as

though the dual score of the swim-
ming encounter was 36-26, and the
basketball score was 42-86, the for-.

closely contested.

and the score read Pitt 28, Army 26,
before» the relay, thus throwing the

the ‘program. It was here that Cap-
tain Bus Wright of the Panther dele-
gation rose to the greatest height of
his career by shoving off as anchor
man three lengths ‘behind 0’Keefe,
Army's best bet, and ﬁnishing a full
length ahead of the Army, ace.
sides this, Captain Wright hung up
two new records for the Army tank
that will stand a lot of heavy splash-
ing before they are washed away.
Bus raced 50. yards in 24 3-5 seconds
for a new military tank mark, and
did the 100-yard event in 56 3-5 sec-

onds for his second record-breaking

During the past several weeks,

the members of the Panther riﬂe

Hatter, have ' been shooting things"

' Two weeks ago, the Panther ‘shot
1822 points to top Ohio State and
Massachusetts Agricultural College

in a three cornered meet. State.

placed third with 1,654.

. Navy was met in a three position

YEARS ago, ‘P’.-A. showed a clean pair of heels
‘to the ﬁeld, of smoking-tobaccos. It has main-
tained its lead ever since, putting more distance
« behind it every year. There must be a reason
why PIA. is the world’s largest-selling brand.
There is! Open a tidy red tin and get a full
breath of that class-by-itself fragrance. Then
tamp a load into the bowl of your pipe and
light up. The first pull tells you why more men
smoke P.A. than any other brand. Cool and
smooth and mellow and mild—-not for one
pipe-load, but always. Try this long-burning
tobacco, Fellows. You'll say so! ‘
