VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 96

Care relies
on medicine

LEAH LAURENT
Staff Writer

Prison inmates suspected of mental
health disorders in the United Kingdom of
the 1960s had many options.

Imnates could choose to take contro-
versial medications, although they risked the
uncertainty of fatal side effects.

Others had the option of undergoing
plastic surgery; although the theory had not
been proven, medical researchers thought
mental illness was related to appearance.

Of course, inmates with the most severe
degrees of mental illness were lucky enough
to receive injections from monkey testicles.’

On Jan. 22, John Wilkinson, assistant
director of the North East London Strategic
Health Authority, spoke to graduate students

in the Cultural Studies Program about the

past and present states of mental health
assessment in the United Kingdom.

According to Wilkinson, the collapse of
personal patient therapy has broken down
the trust _ among mentally ill patients.
Clinical therapy, he said, is now based on
medication and care plans .

“An invisible disability leads to the vis-
ible emption of a visible problem,” he said.

' Wilkinson, who is responsible for men-
tal healthpolicy in the eight areas. of the
United Kingdom where poverty is most
prevalent, related the problems in mental
health risk assessment to the lack of person-
al counseling. In a World in which time
equals money, said Wilkinson, mental care
plans lack depth in patient analysis and risk
assessment. The abundance of medications

designed to treat mental illnesses has pro-'

vided a quick, yet ineffective, solution for
mental health risk assessment

The speech, which was sponsored by
the Graduate Program for Cultural Studies,
gathered a diverse audience of university
students and professors from several depart-
ments. Nancy Condee, a faculty member in
the Slavic Department who introduced
Wilkinson, explained ﬂrat the speech incor-
porated issues affecting various ﬁelds of cul-
tural studies, including psychiatry and social
work ’

LUCY LEITNER
Staff Writer

The Chinese American Students
Association soldout their biggest event
of the year one night before it happened.
The Chinese New Year celebration last
Thursday drew more than 200 students
to the William Pitt Union for a catered
dinner . and skits commemorating
Chinese heritage.

Students crowded around circular

tables with Chinese candy in front of
every place setting and elaborate center-
pieces thattook an ‘hour each to con-
struct, according to Cultural Chair Vikki

Members of CASA traveled as far
as New York and Philadelphia to obtain
supplies, including the blue-and-gold
silk shirts and pants sported by the male
board members. .

“We got these in New York to look

“After today, I.don"t even want to

President Vincent Cheng, a sophomore.

But CASA’s efforts seemed to pay
off, as attendees were anxious to praise
the celebration. .

Symone Redwine, a seniorand the
vice president of the Black Action
Society, said she wished she had partic-
ipated in more intercultural activities,
adding that she was “so happy to be
invited” by her friend Adolph Sims.

Sims claimed to be so excited by the

event that he “stopped dead in [l1is=]*¢**‘

ments and agencies ﬁom providing or lob-
bying for abortion services if they accept
U.S monetary aid, Stephan explained.

“It’s strange seeing how George Bush
affected this tiny town in Bosnia,” she said.

Another student spoke about her time as
an attendant for an online dating instant mes-
saging company, and her experiences deal-
ing with an awkward and socially inept man.

Julia Lucas, a junior at Pitt, relayed her
experiences in Bangladesh and described
how some women received health services
for the ﬁrst time ever. But because of ﬂie gag
rule, women are not educated or given
access to abortion procedures, she said

“They ‘cannot aiford large families,”
Lucas said

Those who attended the speak-out were
supportive in their views of the usefulness of
such a gathering.

“Ithinkit was greatto celebrate the 31st
anniversary of Roe vs. Wade and to bring
people together to speak out and celebrate
it,” said Pitt junior Randee Dur1ford-
Maykall. “In this political atmosphere, I
think it is very important to speak out in an
open environment, without judgment.”

Stephan felt that this would not be the
last time this type of event was organized, or
the last time the CWO would work with
Supernova.

“It’s been a great series that we have
been really excited to work on,” Stephan

said

Stephan also said she felt that the event
was successful, not only in providing an out-
let for women to speak out, but as a way to
get important messages into the open.

“I think we had a good turnout,”
Stephan said. “People had a lot of important
things to say about ' the  move-
ment and women in gene .”

Larger controversy avoided when

SGB debated only

SGB’, page 1

National Yay-For-Abortion _Day,”
Board member Lauren Evette
Williams said. “It’s a lobby day. We",
know what it is. We saw the speaking
points that will be discussed.”

The movement’s opponents, how-
ever, viewed the allocation as a biased
distribution to a‘ liberal organization
and rnisrepresentative of the student
body.

. “If this was another group that §
wanted the money to. send people
down there, I would love to give them
the money,” -Board member Joe
Pasqualichio said. “[My problem] is
that it’s SGB that’s giving this money.”

Board member Charis Jones
argued.that SGB has a responsibility-to
control trips such as the one discussed.

“No- organization can speak for all
the students, except for SGB,” Jones
said. “As long as we keep it under
SGB’s hands, we’re the ones picking
the students who go.” .

Matt Hutchinson turned out to be
the board’s deciding vote, starting the
night in opposition to the allocation

v and ending with a poll of support.

“It seems to me that_USSA is a
controversial issue on this campus, and
it also seems logical that it is contro-
versial because some students do not
desire to be a member of said group,”
Hutchinson read from a prepared state-
ment. “Students have the right to
choose whether they want to be a part
of an organization or not.”

Hutchinson then recommended

that USSA start its own student group "2

at Pitt, separate from SGB.
Jones countered by saying that

single conference

such a group could not be assembled in
time for this year’s conference, which
aims at educating students in the prac-
tice of lobbying and allowing them to
lobby legislators on issues relating to
students.

Board member , Joe Salvatore
added, “Regardless of the policy, plat-
forms and whatever else they stand for,
I think [they’ve proven] that’s not
what they look to achieve on this day.”

“This is our best option for lobby-
ing for what is in the best interest of
the students.”’"

_ Not everyone on the board was-
convinced.

“It wouldn’t”be proper to send peo-

ple down there in the name of SGB,”

Pasqualichio said.

-Board member Todd Brandon
Morris attempted to distinguish the
conference from the organization that
sponsors it. -

“The argument right now isn’t
‘Should we be funding membership
dues to USSA?”’ Morris "said, before
defending the conference’s history. '

g , “I’m going to have to wonder how

. other things are viewed that this board

does,” he added. “If we can’t fund
proven trips that we’ve made in the
past, I’m going to have to question

. more things that we’re doing.” ,
The board skirted the larger con-

troversy of Pitt’s membership in
USSA by focusing a majority of their
debate .~ on the individual conference.
The future of SGB"s relationship with
USSA was left essentially unresolved.

tiatives can visit the group’s Web site

Combattingliporn with digital cameras

, Texas anti-pom crusaders are tak-
ing a legal — and sneaky — approach
to the “problem” of adult entertaimnent
in their area. ‘

. Members of the Oakcrest Family

Church in Texas, led by pastor Jim .

Norwood, have begun taking aim —
with digital cameras — at those that
patronize adult entertainment stores.
Church members photograph cars
parked at adult entertainment stores.
Then, they find where the car is regis-
tered and mail a postcard to the address.

” The postcards feature a picture of
the car at the establishment in question
on the front, and a note on the back
telling the customer their presence in

‘the neighborhood was noted and invit-

ing them to church services.
The idea behind the shame? cam-

I paign, according to Norwood, is to

reach out to and help those suffering

' from pornography addiction, which he

claims is one step along a dangerous
roadrto drug and alcohol addiction and
to criminal sexual behavior.

In Texas, photographing cars and
tracking down owners is not an illegal
practice. Such. information is public
record, and can be found online fora
fee.

. In the United States, purchasing a
copy of Hustler-at Bubba’s Porn Shack
isn’t illegal either. Debate on the moral-
ity of pornography continues, and prob-

ably should. The dangers of consuming .

porn are probably on a continuum, with
some being completely innocuous,
some distasteful, and some downright
violent and degrading. Who are the
members of Oakcrest Family Church to

determine what’s being purchased, and

for what reason?

The church members’ actions,
while legal, are slimy. It seems highly
unlikely that a porn consumer, upon
receipt of such a postcard, will feel any-
thing but affronted and invaded. It
would be interesting to ﬁnd out just
how many new members joined the
church after getting a sha1ne—o—gram in
the mail.

The majority of consumers of
pornography are not rapists or child
molesters _or even particularly creepy.
Perhaps the customer in question was
picking up a magazine to enjoy with her
husband as a normal part of their
healthy, married sex life.

The church has spent $1,500 so far
on digital cameras and other costs asso-
ciated with this enterprise, mostly from
private donations; Whilenot exactly a
princely sum, it’s likely that a few
needy people could have been fed a
dinner or two for that money.

Rather than invade the lives of
adults consuming a legal product that
they find disgusting, perhaps members
of Oakcrest Family Church could go
out on a limb and actually help some-
one who needs it.

Extreme political correctness up North

Freedom of speech and afree exchange

-of ideas are some of the notions we as

Americans pride ourselves upon. These
ideals were part of the founding of our
nation, and have become part of our nation-
al identity. Part of that freedom is tolerance
for viewpoints that many people might dis-
agree with, or even ﬁnd distasteful. Our First
Amendment still allows such unpopular
ideas to be voiced \

In Canada, though, the free-
doms we take for granted are
falling by the wayside. There has
been a movement since the mid
‘60s in that country to make

Goldman said in response to the article, and
he has the CJC’s backing in calling for
charges against Hussain. Certainly, he is
right when he calls the article “hate speech.”
However, he crosses a serious line when he
says that no one has the right to express an
opinion deemed hateful.

The vague group of “hate speech laws”
that die Canadian Parliament has passed
over ﬂie last several years is
what allows people like
Goldman to call for criminal
charges against people like
Hussain. The hate speech
code prohibits statement

The vitriolic article, written by noted

and offensive. His article accuses Jews of
more than 80 ridiculous transgressions,
including starting both of the World Wars,
faking the Holocaust, and staging the Sept
11 attacks. Obviously, Steele is a hate-mon-
ger, deserving of no one’s respect Nusrat
Hussain, The Miracles editor, probably
should have shown some restraint and
reﬁised to print Steele’s article; But does that
really mean that such people as Steele and
Hussain are not deserving of the same basic.
liberties that all people in a free and open.
society should enjoy? Indeed, if mere
thoughts can make one a criminal, is anyone
really free?

Nisson Goldman and his organization,
the Canadian Jewish Congress, apparently
are not bothered by those concerns. “Free

comts have done little to clarify the code’s
parameters. Hussain could face I up to two
years in jail for choosing to print an article.

Obviously, the Canadian government
itself has ciossed a very serious line as well.
They now believe it is justiﬁed to imprison a
person because of ideas raﬂaer than actions.
We must ask ourse1ves,is it really worth it to
do away with the freedom of speech in order
to prevent people from being offended? Our
neighbors to the north have already
answered that question with a resounding
yes. They’ve taken political correctness to its
ultimate extreme. Everyone in the United

Suggestions for boinking beyond boundaries of bed

Dear Sex N’At:
I’ve never had sex anywhere but

, in a boring 01’ bed. How can I go

about spicing up the locations of
where me and my significant other
get it on?

Also, what would you consider
the best campus places to get hot
and heavy?

Sincerely,
Tryin’ to Spice it Up
Dear Tryin’:

While bed-sex is reliable and
comfy, extra-mattressal intercourse
can certainly be spicy, and for a lot
of different reasons, depending on
where you do it.

‘ 'There’s the “oh my god, we’r_e
surely going to get caught” thrill of

‘ doing it someplace public or nearly

public, the “take this job and shove
it” thrill of ﬂinging everything off
the desk and boinking right there in
your cubicle, and the sheer freaky-
deeky thrill of someplace really
weird, like the bathroom. '

If you are going for very—nearly
caught fun, keep in mind that it’s
likely best to be a quickie.

Almost getting caught is sexy
and produces adrenaline. Getting

caught is yicky and produces cita-
tions.

Have you discussed
this desire of yours with

A perfect world with more CNN than GrandT heft Auto

On a typical day, it’s not something I think about, or A the Eagles warranted a hole in the wall, yet the day the
kid realized that all of Pitt was through sched-

even notice. However, recently it hit me
like a ton of bricks: peoples’ priorities are

planned for us —— particularly d11ring an election year?
Even during a Presidential election year, less than ,

considerably out of whack.

I’m no exception to this tidbit of
truth. I’ll stand at the bookstore for ﬁf-
teen minutes seriously contemplating ifl
should shell out $30 for a textbook or just
try to make do without it; yet I ‘think
nothing of dropping $70 on yet another
pair of shoes. Hell, ifI spent half as much
time on reading my assignments from
professors as I do issues of People and Us
magazine, I’d probably be a certiﬁed
genius by now. Perhaps that’s wishful
thinking.

The most glaring example of whacked-out priorities
that comes to mind occurred the other weekend. Let it
be said that the world knows no fury like the wrath of a
diehard Eagles fan after the Birds lose in the second
round of the playoffs for the third year in a row. The
team’s horrendous game play resulted in a three-foot
hole in the drywall of my friend’s apartment. Bye-bye,

security deposit. This Neanderthal action is certainly not '

typical of my pal, who is generally a pretty levelheaded
dude. I, too, was not the least bit pleased with the fate of
my favorite team, but I’m not willing to be out a couple
hundred bucks just‘because the Eagles’ wide receivers
couldn’t catch‘ so much as a cold that day.

The irony of the whole situation was that the loss by

All of this may seem trivial and not
worthy of discussion, but take a look at all the
other important subjects and issues that are
put on the back burner while we’re all having
panic attacks if our AOL Instant Messenger

Last year, according to Superbowl.com, 138.9 mil-
lion people timed in to watch the game — a game that
is historically a blowout but is redeemed by some witty

and ludicrously expensive commercials typically

involving beer bottles wearing football helmets —— and
next week’s numbers are certainly unlikely to go down.
Preliminary estimates on Variety.com say that a mere
43.4 million people tuned in last week to watch the
President address Congress and the nation in his State of
the Union address. —

To be fair, it’s obvious that G.W. doesn’t have half
the charisma that a six pack of longnecks sporting foot-
ball hehnets do, but shouldn’t we, the public, want to be
informed of all the dire schemes our President has

age bracket. College students claim to be too busy to
take the ten minutes to register or send in an absentee
ballot, but I’ ve actually witnessed games of Grand Theft
Auto on PlayStation that started at noon and ended just
before 2 a.m. Ah, the struggle that is effective time man-

Currently our country is facing a serious weight i
problem. Millions of dollars ‘are spent eachyear treating 4

conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and depres-

sion that are all linked to obesity. Even though our .

Talk: Up-and-coming Gavin DeGraW

INTERVIEWED BY
Brian Palmer

Only 26 years of age, Gavin DeGraw has the
charisma and talent to boost himself to music star-
dom. Through word of mouth, he is slowly taking the
music industry by storm. Signed to V
Clive Davis’ J Records, his debut
album Chariot arrived in stores alittle
under a year ago. Since then, he has
embarked on his first headlining tour.
The Pitt News had the opportunity to
talk with Gavinjwhen he was ‘recently

Before you performed at last year’s
Pre-Grammy party, Clive Davis
introduced you as “the next big
thing.” VVhat were you feeling? "
Sick to my stomach and terrified
(laughs). ’

Alicia Keys was introduced much
like you were and she went on to win
a Grammy. Does that add any extra
pressure for you?

Actually the pressure isn’t really for me
personally to perform or to play. The
only pressure is living up to the expec-
tation of being introduced by someone
like Clive Davis. I’m not seeking a tro-

tour and make records. I’m not really

think other people are more concerned
about that for me than I am. It’s more
like something that’s been put before me, it’s like
“okay here’s the goal.” But that’s sort of considered

an extra burden than what I was initially after, which

was just to play for people and not be concerned with
what ends up on my shelf, ' —

That seems like a totally different attitude than a
lot of the pop stars of the MTV era. Do you find
that to be your mentality when making music?

Yeah, I think that’s really the most important thing. If
you’re simply trying to achieve an audience that only
goes to the Grammys or is Grammy-worthy in recent‘
years, than you would be alienating a good portion of

«the public that like pure music. Whatis pop trophy-

accessible and rewarded isn’t_necessarily my favorite

thing to listen to anyway.

. It can be -pretty ruthless attimes trying to get your

name out there when just starting out in music,
and you’ve experienced that. What advice would
you give to musicians who are trying to get noticed
much like you were?

If it is what you really love to do, you just have to put
everything else in your life on hold or to the side and
just do what you love to do as much as you possibly.
can because it’s your passion. You have to be really
tenacious and savvy as you can be about where you
play also. Try to find places that are aside from your

regular ‘gig. Try to go to places where you know or
hear people from the industry have gone, and hang at,

and play places like that once in a while. Then you,

say, “It’s cool hanging out here, but I’m actually
going to go play my regular gig, which is for regular

people —— people who just want to come hang out on

Saturdaynight and drink and hear music./” Not to real-
ly busy yourself with theindustry, but get the word
out" that you’re around, and you. have a standing gig.
You really need to just play because you love to play.
Play for yourself and play for the people, but don’t
play for the business because that will eat at you too
much. -

-You’ve been described as a mix of Billy Joel and

Elton John, with the soul of Stevie Wonder, as Well
as a number of other comparisons. Who would you
say inﬂuences you? -

I think that those are deﬁnitely major inﬂuences of
mine, also the Beatles, Hank Williams, Willy Nelson,
Sam Cooke, Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens and Van
Morrison. They’re all really important, as well as a
bunch of collections of classic rock that Llisten to
whenever I get a chance. I listen to — as much as I
can —— everyone from the popular, classic rock and
soul, from The Four Tops to the more. obscure stuff,
like The Strawberry Alarm Clock. Just as much stuff
as I can possibly get my hands on. I love old—style
music.

What are you trying to do with your music?

I don’t want to take it in any one particular direction.
I try to keep the styles alive that I fell in love with and
that I like to listen to and try- and play, and just make

all of them part of my own repertoire, part of my own
writing style. And not really have a particular style.
Rather have my consistency be my inconsistency.
Have the freedom to do whatever I like. Radiohead
changes «up their records all the time, that’s sort of
what’s. really cool and really horrible about them.
Some audience members don’t want to
hear their obscure stuff, some people
want to hear the one popular record or
two popular records of an artist.

Your music is very universal. Young
and old alike can enjoy and relate to
your music. But do you ﬁnd that you
get more of a younger crowd at
shows, and Why do you think that is
so?  -

I think that at a lot of the shows in the

crowd particularly because young peo-
ple like to try _new things. I also ﬁnd that
people who are a little older come to the
show are into it also; it depends on how
it’s getting out there, how they’re hear—
ing about it. People are more likely to
hear about it at college or in high school
because everybody uses a computer in
college and high school and everybody

spreads with technology; it’s definitely

target a type of audience. I just want to
write good ‘songs, and I don’t want the
people who are listening to my music
when they are 13 to be ashamed that
they were listening to me when they
were 13 when they’re 30 or when they’re 40.

Where-do you get your inspiration to Write a song?
A lot of it is a personal, storytelling type of thing.
Sometimes it’s something someone told me about
what happened to them or I overhear a conversation
or anything really, as far as the lyrical content goes.
And the other aspect, the musical content, sometimes
you think about an artist and you go “You know what
I’d like to write something that maybe AC/DC would
sing or I’d like to write something that Donnie
Hathaway would sing.” So you sit down and pick the
type of music that you’re going to aim for, for that
song and that topic. Some styles of music lend them-
selves to certain types of lyrics. [For example] R&B
music lends itself to sexuality. Rock lends itself to
sexuality, politics and aggravation. Singer/songwriter
music lends itself to love and heartbreak, and country
music lends itself to work and to money problems, to
family and things like that. They all come together for
whatever happens in the song.

How has touring helped people get to know who
Gavin DeGraW is?

For me, the whole point of touring is to show the
legitimacy of the artist. To me, live music is the truth,

Kutcher earns his wings

terfly wing ‘can cause great change
and disaster much further along the
line.

“The Butterﬂy Effect,” starring

Ashton Kutcher in his dramatic act—.

ing debut, takes this idea of a small
incident creating" huge conse-
quences and turns it into a com-
pelling and frightening film that lit—‘
erally keeps you on the edge of your

- seat throughout the entirety of film.

Kutcher is Evan Treborn, who as
a child went through some pretty
traumatic incidents. When he tried
to forget about them he would
blackout, leaving him missing huge
chunks of memory from some
important and tragic~times in his
youth.

Evan experiences these black"-
_outs in key times and events, like
being’ tormented by the sick and
perverted father of his ,4ehildhood
friends, Kayleigh (Amy Smart) —

who becomes Evan’s love interest -

and Tommy Miller. This abuse from
their father, played by a slimy Eric
Stoltz,»leads the precious Kayleigh
to become a suicidal wreck and
Tommy to become a rageful and

angry youth. To cope with his,

blackouts, a doctor at a psychiatric
hospital suggests that Evan keep .a
daily journal in order to jog his
memory in case of blackouts.

Seven years later, We find Evan
in college, celebrating his seventh
anniversary of no blackouts with his
roommate, Thumper (Ethan Suplee)
But he soon “finds himself having a
blackout similar to those that struck
him as a kid» while readingone of
his old journal entries, only this
time he can see things he_'couldn’t
before. i

‘Evan finds that by going back to

these events — traveling back in
,time in’ his head '— he can right the
wrongs and make everything per-
fect. In one scene, Evan goes back
to a time in which he was visiting
his father, who apparently suffered
similar ‘blackouts and was perma-
nently placed in a psych ward.

When he originally had this visit
as a child, /Evan blacked out; when

he goes back to the incident, he sees ’

the conversation. But in it, the older
Evan can choose wlfat to say to his
father. Evan tells_ his dad that he
plans to change the past and make
everything right. His~.father replies

by telling him»that.he can’t play.

God. Evan discovers this, but not

Ari Hest rocks

the South Side

An intimate setting, a few drinks

and great music — have it all
»Monday night when yet another
young singer/songwriter makes a stop
in Pittsburgh.

A 26-year-old native of New
York, Ari Hest will be co—heading a
show at Nick’s Fat City with
Richmond, Va., based jam band
Carbon Leaf, who will be taking the
stage first.

Hest will be performing with a
full band, but his roots are as a solo
artist, playing to crowds with his
Voice and an acoustic guitar. His
lyrics are beautifully constructed and
sung with a sometimes-raspy croon,
but he can utilize a falsetto that is
reminiscent of Jeff Buckley or Martin
Sexton. l

Hest is currently also on tour with

,hometown favorites The Clarks, on

' the Rubber Hits the Road Tour, which
plays dates that straddle this
Pittsburgh performance. _

The guys in Carbon Leaf, who
were recently selected as “Best in
Richmond,” play a very energetic set,
filled with every sound you can imag-
ine. Playing any style from straight
rock ‘n’ roll to a more jam band style,
mixing in a folk twang at times.

With stage presence from both of
these acts that move any audience to
their feet, this show is set to be an
interesting mix of energy and smooth
style that will definitely be worth the
price of admission.

Ari Hest and Carbon Leaf will be per-
forming an all-ages Show Monday
night at Nick’s Fat City on the South
Side. The show starts at 7:30 p.m.
Tickets are $10 and can be purchased
at the door. For more information,

Singer-songwriter is on the cusp

Talk, page 7

and you’re only as good an artist as you
are the day you show up. One day you
feel like you’re doing great, and the
next day you might think that you’re
the worst artist you’ve ever heard.
That’s part of the beauty of it, the fact
that it’s unpredictable. The fact that it is
unpredictable is what’s cool about it,
and that helps create buzz. The fact that
when you get on stage you can get ner-

vous and the wrong thing can come out A

and you might go “Oh I gotta back
pedal” and see how good your free
wheeling skills are. It’s exciting to go
out and try to do something ‘different
and to do the unexpected, or to try
something new and blunder or do well‘,
and to me that’s what’s so important.

, You get a chance to go out and prove

yourself, and if you prove yourself you
get the immediate satisfaction of an
audience cheering for you. If -you’re not
that great then you’re learning, and you
ﬁnd out that this works but this doesn’t
work. Touring helps you improve and
you’re learning and when you stop
improving or become content with
where you are at, then‘ you’re in trou-
ble. 1

What goes on — on the road — when

. you aren’t onstage or prepping to go

onstage?

A lot of writing, terrible movies. You
ultimately run out of good things to
watch, so you buy crappy movies on
the road like “Three Truckers Go To
Arkansas,” and you say “This is the
most boring movie I’ve.ever watched,”
but you watch it because you’ve run out
of good stuff to watch.

It’s your first headlining tour, so that
means you get to ride around in a
big, fancy bus. What’s in your CD
player on the bus?

(Laugh) The last thing we listened to
was the 0 Br0_ther, Where art Thou
soundtrack. (Sings the opening line of
“Man of Constant Sorrow”) We’re just
music lovers. When you just love
music in general and you don’t think to
yourself that you have to ﬁt a personal-
ity or a type of group that you hang
with then you can really get into music.
Because then you’re not ashamed of
what kind of music you’re into. Just
throwing a football around doesn’t
mean you have to listen to hardcore
rap. Just because you’re nerdy doesn’t
mean that you have to listen to indie.
You don’t have to choose a social group

to ﬁnd your music, you just listen to

music because you like it, and you get
into whatever your heart tells you is
good.

“Effect” is an impressive effort

Effect, page 8.

Kutcher is completely surpris-
ing and effective as a dramatic lead-
ing man. He proves that he doesn’t
need to be a goof ball and that, with
theright material, he can rise above

T the “Dude, Where’s My Car?” roles.

He plays hurt and confused‘ very
well, as do his child aCtQ1‘._,c.ounter-

‘parts. Having to deal, Withthe tough
_subject ‘matter of the scenes in 3
which they were placed, the young

actors performed with brilliance and

cially in some of the more ,.heart-,

wrenching scenes. Amy‘ Smart ‘is
also wonderful‘, pulling together

vast differences in character 
playing a prissy, sweet sorority girl “

in one life, a strung out prostitute in
the next. _ ’ '

The film marks the; directorial‘

debuts of Eric Bress andiJ. Mackye
Gruber ——, co-writers of the dismal

“Final Destination '2.” They keep
the viewer on the edge, waiting to
see where the story will turn next,
all while keeping the story moving
forward towards the final turn that
leads to the ending credits. And,
luckily, their script is a huge step
forward from their previous work.
“The Butterﬂy Effect” is a seri-
ous sci-fi thriller’ that twists and
turns and never loses its suspense,

which is heightened by taking the

audience on an emotional roller

coaster. One minute We’re feeling '

happy for the characters, hopeful
that everything has been settled. But
then the film quickly turns, leaving

pus feeling depressed that the charac-
rters are still in pretty bad situations.

prised and, if you’re like me, wanti-

their 66-45 win over the Orangemen
on Saturday night.

Pitt (19-1 overall, 5-1 Big East)
outscored Syracuse (13-3, 3-2) 40-

A 18 in the paint and the Panthers’

front court led the way, scoring 44
of Pitt’s 66 points. Forward Chevon
Troutman recorded a double double
with 12 points and 11 rebounds.

Troutman said the reasons the
Panthers’ front court was so domi-
nant was because of the way
Syracuse plays its top two guards in
its 2-3 zone defense. The scheme
made it difficult for the Panthers to
get open looks, so they instead
worked the paint.

Another reason the Panthers
scored so many points down low
was because of how well Pitt played
along the boards. Pitt pulled down
20 offensive rebounds and scored
16 second-chance points.

Freshman forward Chris Taft
was also in the double-digits
in scoring with 15 points,
while pulling down eight
rebounds. '

Forward Mark
McCarroll came off the
Panthers’ bench and scored
15 points, including two
clutch three-pointers in the
second half when Pitt was
running down the game
clock.

“I don’t see why they
left [McCarroll] so open,”
Taft said.

The three-pointefs
shocked many in the arena,
but teammates of McCarroll
weren’t as impressed.

“It’s nothing new. He

time [in practice],”
Troutman said, smiling.

Pitt took an early 14-7
lead after hitting three
straight three-pointers -—
two from guard Julius Page
and one from guard Carl
Krauser. ‘

Syracuse battled back
and culminated its come-
back with a three-pointer

from guard Gerry McNamara, who
was a game-time decision due to a
groin injury.

His three-pointer made the
Carrier Dome rumble and it gave
the Orangemen a 21-20 lead with
4:09 remaining in the first half. But
that would be the loudest the crowd
would get and the largest lead
Syracuse would own. A

The crowd noise that followed
did not rattle the psyche of the
Panthers, but rather, it awoke the
Panthers’ offense from its momen-
tary slumber.

With 3:42 left in the first half,
Jaron Brown drove through the
paint and laid the ball up for two
points. The basket gave Pitt a 22-21
lead and it was the point in the
game where the Panthers began to
pull away from Syracuse.

Soon after that,‘Brown accepted
a long outlet pass and was fouled as
his layup went through for two
points. .

Following a layup by Krauser,
Troutman pulled down a rebound
and laid the ball in with eight,sec-
onds left in the first half. The buck-
et gave the Panthers a_ halftime lead
of 29-23.

et back on track

After hitting only 32.4 percent
of their shots in the first half, the
Panthers‘ found themselves getting
open looks, connecting on 59.3 per-
cent of their attempts in the second
half. h

Right out of the locker room,
Krauser drove down the court and
dished the ball.off to Taft, who hus-
tled_his way to the paint for the
layup. g,

Taft, McCarroll and Troutman
accounted for the first 12 points
scored by Pitt in the second half

that led to a 41-30 lead with 13:06 --

left in the game.

The Panthers then went on a 9-0
run, which was capped with a slam
dunk by center Toree Morris.
Morris worked the ball down low
and elevated to slam the ball
through with authority. While on
his way down, he slammed his open
hand against the glass backboard.

The Panthers’ next points would
come on an alley-oop dunk by
McCarroll and a crowd-silencing
dunk by Taft, which put Pitt up 54-
37.

McCarroll would rattle the rim

BRIAN GOLDMAN‘
Staff Writer --

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — With all the
big time talk, and all the big time
anticipation for the showdown
between No. 8 Pitt and No. 13
Syracuse, it was appropriate that the
game would belong to the big men
in the paint.

The top three Pitt scorers head-
ing into Saturday’s battle with
Syracuse were Jaron Brown, Carl
Krauser and Julius Page. But on
Saturday, the leading scorers were
Mark McCarroll and Chris Taft with
15 points each, and Chevon

.Troutman with 12.

“We can all score,” Taft said.
“Sometimes the big guys have to
help out the guards. Sometimes the
guards help us out. It’s a team
thing.”

It wasn’t until the second half

_ that the Pitt big men began to wear

down the Orangemen. McCarroll
scored all 15 of his points in the
second half, shooting shots from
both the paint as well as two three-
pointers. Troutman recorded 11
rebounds to go along with his 12
points.

“McCarroll is real big for us,”
Taft said. “He is our spark off the
bench.”

At halftime, Pitt held a slim 29-
23 lead. The second half was a dif-
ferent story. The combination of
Troutman, McCarroll, Taft. and
Toree Morris scored 33 of the 37
second-halfpoints the Panthers put
on the board. Meanwhile, Pitt was
able to hold the Orangemen to
seven of 27 from the field in the
second half.

In the beginning of the second
half, the Panthers began extending
their lead.

After Brown missed a jumper,
Troutman pulled down the board.
His shot went off the rim, but was
pulled down by Taft who went right
back up but missed his shot as well.
However, Troutman was right there

Enough already! I’ve had it with
Michelle VVie. Someone over there at the
PGA headquarters needs to stand up and
be a man ... which is to say, ban little girls
from playing on the tour.

Before everyone jumps on my case
about picking. on a 14-year-old girl, let me
say that I am a proponent of age restric-
tions for everything, or at least everything
in America. I oppose age restrictions in
Canada, Mexico and Europe, since those
places provide wonderful outlets for
underage Americans. So if the Canadian
Professional Golfers’ Association wants to
let Wie play in every tournament, that’s
their choice.

But I don’t want to see Wie playing in
any more tournaments in America I don’t
care if she’s the best golfer to ever set foot
on Earth. I don’t care if she could beat
Tiger Woods by 30 strokes. I don’t care if
she could shoot a 65 blindfolded. I don’t
want to see it.

Age is definitely something that’

sports, only football has a restriction
besides being 18. Minor sports like tennis
and soccer don’t even have that They say
that if you’re good enough to compete with
the pros, you’re good enough to be a pro.

Every year there are new stories
emerging about young athletes trying to
make the big bucks by turning pro early.
Last year there was talk of I_eBron James
turning pro after his junior year of high
school, and the current talk is of Maurice
Clarett turning pro after being only two
years removed from high school. What I
say to that is no and no.

Sports like football and basketball are
different from many of the other sports
because of how physical they are. There’s
no way 99 percent of kids coming out of
high school could take a hit from Ray
Lewis. Heck, many pros can’t take a hit
from Ray Lewis. And in basketball, most
college athletes can’t keep up with the pros
as far as muscle strength, stamina or agili-

ty. It’s a huge deal to go from playing 35 -

40-minute games a year in college to 82
48-minute games in the NBA, let alone
going from high school to the pros.

So what about the non—physically
demanding sports like golf‘? Well ﬁrst of
all, to clear up a common misconception,
golf is not a sport I’ve always known it

plagues professional sports. Of the major Newby, page 14

Personally, I can see why the age of

consent should be lower than, say, the
age we require for presidency, but I can’t
see how a woman who could potentially
bear children is not mature enough to hit
a ball with a stick, should her skills be up
to snuff.
. Mr. Newby is right, however, in say-
ing that a great majority of athletes are
not ready for competition on the highest
level by the time they are 18. He says that
“Not everyone can be [LeBron] James or
Amare Stoudamire.” I would note that
not everyone can be Wayne Gretzky,
who, having been born in 1961, would
have been 17 for his inaugural season of
professional hockey in 1978. He would
have been 18 for the year of his first
MVP season, which was, for Penn State
fans, the year after his first one.

But just because these precocious
athletes are few and far between doesn’t
mean they should be excluded. Mr.
Newby, apparently, would have kept

14-year-old girls can compete with the
best men in the world. He asks us to

name another sport where that is the »

How about gymnastics? Figure skat-
ing? There are many sports where 14-
year-old girls are dominant participants
and can hold their own with any man.
You don’t think it takes strength to hold
your entire body in the air with one arm?
You don’t think it takes power and agili-

But in women’s ﬁgure skating, if
women could turn pro without sacriﬁc-

ing the chance at Olympic gold, they;

would turn pro at age 13. How old was
Michelle Kwan when she turned pro
because the highest level of competition
— the Olympics — was no longer a
viable option for her? Twenty, maybe? I

accompanied by a scream that res-
onated throughout' the ‘now—quiet

.Pitt held Syracuse to 45 points,
which was the lowest offensive out-
put by any Orangemen team in the.
Carrier Dome.

“[Pitt is] just too strong right

home this dunk during the second half

came off the bench to score 15 points.

his put-back layup was good,
extending the Panthers’ lead to
seven. ~

Both Taft and Troutman were
unstoppable all night. They became
immovable objects parked under-
neath the basket, while pulling

down everything that came their

way. .
Craig Forth, Syracuse’s starting
center, was held to only three points
and two rebounds, and at times
seemed to be a boy’ playing among
men underneath the basket. ‘

“Pitt is too strong and too phys-

ical _ for us right now,” Syracuse
head coach Jim Boeheim said.
“They are a veteran physical team.”

It wasn’t just the offense in the
paint providing the spark for the
Panthers all night — it was the
defense as well. While the Panthers
outscored Syracuse in the paint 40-
18, Pitt also out—rebounded the
Orangemen, 50-36.

' “We base our program on
rebounding,” Dixon said. “Our
defensive rebounding and transition
defense was there for 40 minutes
today.” 1

With Troutman and Taft in foul
trouble for the majority of the game,

off the bench came McCarro1l to
steal the show. He gave Pitt its first
double-digit lead, 41-30, as he

brought the house down with a mon-

ster dunk.

As the lead for the Panthers kept.

expanding in the second half, the
show time dunks began‘. On three
consecutive possessions, Morris hit
a rim—rattling dunk, followed by an

alley-oop from Taft to McCarroll.

And on the very next posses-
sion, Taft was left all alone and bent
the _rim to near its breaking point. At
this point Pitt took a 54-37 lead and
was well on its way to its 19th vic-
tory of the year.

Newby, page 12

Wasn’t a sport, but it wasn’t until last week
that I heard the best reason why.

On the ESPN Show “Around the
Horn,” host Max Kellerrnan brought up a
great point: golf carmot be a sport if a 14-
year—old girl can complete with the best
men in the world. That is so true. Think of
another sport where that is true. Could a
14-year old girl return a 140 mph serve
from Andy Roddick or a hit a 100 mph
pitchifrom Randy Johnson. The answer is
a resounding no. I respect golfers a great
deal. I can’t play golf at all, and I’m not
arguing that golfers aren’t great at what
they do. But I can’t bowl either or do that
thing with the brooms, but are bowling and
curling sports either?

So to get back to my point, why

shouldn’t Wre be allowed to participate in “

PGA events? It’s about principle, plain and
simple. She shouldn’t be allowed to com-
pete in pro events because she’s 14 and
that’s just the way it is. I don’t care that
she’s a girl either.

If a 14-year-old boy wanted to com-
pete, I would be opposed to that as well.
They should set a minimum age of 18 and
that’s ﬁnal. Establish yourself as the best

among your peers ﬁrst and then take on the
» pros. Tiger won three U.S. Amateur

Championships before turning pro. He
established himself‘ as the best and when
he ﬁnally played_ with the big boys. He
beat them because he was as skilled as he
could be. He didn’t take on the best in the
world when he was 14 just to prove he
could. ‘I '

W'1e’s father says that she must com-
pete with the best in the world to get better,
but that can’t make her better. Maybe more

used to scrutiny, but not better at golf. It’s
understandable that everyone learns a dif-
ferent way, but is playing against the best
really the way to go? If I wanted to learn
how to improve my basketball defense,
would it beneﬁt me more to join a league
made up of college students like myself or
jump right into trying to defend Shaquille
O’Neal in the,low—post‘.7 That may be a bad
example because Shaq has about 16 inch-
es and 180 pounds on me, but you get the
point .

In basketball, most players that come
straight from high school can’t compete
with the best. Kobe Bryant, Tracy
McGrady and Jermaine O’Neal .— all of
these guys struggled their ﬁrst years.
Kwame Brown, Eddy Curry and Tyson
Chandler are all coming into their own
now, during their third year in the league.

Not everyone can be James or Amare
Stoudernire-. Both of those guys were

anomalies as far as their physical growth,’

Both were men when they entered the
NBA. Just imagine how much better they

' would be if they played even one year in

college. .

' Now,  can’t blame anyone for turning
pro and taking the money. I would do so in
a heartbeat But that doesn’t mean it should
happen. —

If you’re a high school basketball
player who wants to get paid right away,
go play over in Europe. If you’re a high
school football star who thinks you’re all
that, try taking on some Canadians ﬁrst.
Then call me in two years.

Golf belongs with more physical sports

Flaherty, page 12 I

ketball cease to be a sport when a player

. steps to the free-throw line and technique

supersedes athleticism? Golf is not only a
sport, it is a better sport, though surely
not more fun to watch, than these other

sports. Why?» Because a 14-year-old girl v

can compete, if she works hard enough.
How about a sport that doesn’t elirrrinate
95 percent of the worldis population as
soon as they emerge from the womb?
But basketball is a sport because 7—foot-
tall men with absolutely no athletic talent
whatsoever make $6 million per year?

In golf, you can have major champi-
ons like Corey Pavin or Justin Leonard,
both of whom are, to borrow a phrase
from “Rudy,” “5—foot-nothing, ‘a hundred
and nothing.” Golf is a’ sport accessible
to people who are not born as freaks of
nature. Golf merely eliminates  . 95 per-
cent of the'world’s population because
they can’t‘afford golf clubs. So nothing’s
perfect. V

But while we’re on golf, Mr. Newby

says that “[Tiger Woods] didn’t take on
the best in the world when he was 14 just
to prove he coul  No, he took on the
best when he was 16, in the Nissan Los
Angeles Open, in 1992. And speaking
from the standpointof a golfer, W"1e is
more ready to play professional golf than
Tiger was then. But the comparison is
misguided anyway, because any player
who “takes on the world’s best” in golf
actually has to win to make any money.
Meanwhile, a high school basketball
player 4- say, Kwarne Brown —- can go
pro and get $6 million a year to grab
fewer rebounds than Tiger would.

Mr. ‘Newby and Kellerrnan both
seem to let their opinions of what consti-
tutes a sport be dictated by the antiquat-
ed‘ belief that girls can’t have game. If

this wasn’t an issue of sexism, why did ’

neither man realize that there are sports
where the pinnacle of competition is
among teen-age girls?
