Turning from his mid-week
blackboard strategy, Coach Wes
Fesler beamed these remarks on
tomoi-row’s game:

“The boys are entering tomor-
row‘s game in as 'g‘00d a shape
as they have been in allseason.
We’re going in as the underdog,
but that doesn't worry us a hit
any more. Of’ course, the game is
a toss~up, but you can bet we are
going to try our level best to win.
The team has come a long way,
and they are in ﬁne spirit. Prac-
tice games have demonstrated
this. - A
6“I saw Penn-State play Navy
last week. and they are tough op-
position, but we are ready for
them. We all have great f2 itli in
the _team. and we hope the stu-
dents do. too. We need and want
strong student backing tomor-
row." ' ‘

yet no deﬁnite arran.2;eiiients have
been made to ltidge the State or-

but the Lion band will appear for
the gaiine.

The Combined 2i_g‘g‘i'eg2iti<iiis will ’

pei'ioi‘m belore ganie-time and
ClLll'll]g'.lLlle hall. Pro-gaine plans
call for the playing oi‘ the"1iational
anthem by the groups. The State
band will then form letters to

honor each school wrilc the Pitt

nicn march out a keystone around
the Lion formatioiis. The rrusical
score will feature State's Nittainy
Lion SOl'lg and l’.it.t's P:ini'i‘ei num-

At hall'—l.ime the bands will re-
group to form a “l?." a keystone,
and an “S"' to salute the Lions
while the Penn State alma mater
is played. The next figure honors
Pitt by a “U 01’ P" forination as

It is fast; becoming known that there are bigger and bet-

largc enrollment, more of that

intangible thing called school spirit (despite much discussion
pro and con), and more an’ around activities for both men and .

women. One of the improvements for post-war Pitt was the
revival by Student congress of the demonstrattion block to
enable more/effective organized cheering. Much work was done -
before. the block appeared ‘in the Stadium the canvass capes
were cleaned, designs were Worked out, and men spent time
organizing the students for participation in the block.
‘Tomorrow the student body will turn out in force to see
the last football game of the 1946 season. They will be ready
to cheer their team on. They will be willing to take part in
the demonstration block. But there won’t be a block!
Students organizing the cheering block, in an attempt to
make it’ as eﬁective as possible, asked permission of the Ath-
letic department. to have a public address system set up to
give instructions to students. The request was refused. James
Hagan, director of athletics, opposed the -use of the public
address system claiming it “disturbs the paying customers.”’
’It was always our impression that
were most interested in student cheering and, in viewing the
demonstration block, as well as the Pitt band. Perhaps, Mr.
Hagan also believes that the Panther, ‘adorned, in his ﬁne new
outvﬁt; “disturbs the paying customers.” _
& C At a. recent meeting of the Athletic committee, of which
‘Mr; Hagan is a prominent member, it was suggested and voted
upon to further-A-investigate use of the public address for next
year’s games. The committee also suggested use of a “card
system.” This system has already been investigated by Stu-
dent congress, and it has been agreed that it is ineﬁective with

‘ ‘ paying customers”

.Pitt students aren’t interested in “further investigation.”
s year’s hope should be this year’s reality. ’

_. Surprising, but nevertheless true, is the fact that the foot-
ball game is only one part of the Saturday afternoon’s enter-
tainment for both students and paying customers. Why do you
suppose Mr. Robert Arthur spends so much time and energy
in drilling the Pitt band? Why do you think the University
purchase a. Panther skin ail: greatdifﬁculty and

I . Maybe there were some other reasons for the refusal that
wercn’t« told——instaIlation difficulties or
don’t tell us it would “disturb

somcthing—but, please,
the, paying customers.” It’s

sion is more complex and difficult

not stimulated by razzle-dazzle
cheer—leading.

_ It is my impression that the
writer of the above mentioned
letter was driving at streamlining
the cheerleading setup, with pos-
sible addition of girls in short
skirts, some bo-wo-skee-watten-

Cadillac super—coupes at the half.
Certainlythe student group needs

“a good sho-t in the arm, but fol-

lowing the well foundedcriticisrn
of Wes Fesler at the rally preced-

cheering‘ left little to be desired.

The prime reason for the lack
of student cheering support, in
my opinion, is that a very small
percentage of the students know
the Pitt cheers‘ and especially the
songs. (All are listed in the Vade
Mecum an-d Compass.) There is
nothing wrong with the cheers;
they have a powerful surge of ex-
pression in Yeah, Pitt, Fight,
Fight-, Fight! than to yell an ema-
ciated “Give ‘cm the ax, the ax,
the ax! Where? Right in the neck,
the neck, the neck,” which only
gives the spectators a silly laugh
and the morbid afterthought,
“What will these college r ids think
of next?” As a matter of fact it
must be recognized that the col-
lege student is a mature person
and will react favorably to a sit-
uation where thefopponents have
the hall on our‘ ten yard line and
the yell Yeah, Pitt, Sock It To

THE PITT NEWS

   

 

Page Five

c

by Abby Clark

The female ends of this col-
umn are shouting and clamoring
this week because of new pledges,
but the males are still jumbled
until Monday, at least. Mean-
while, we’ll pass on (or would
you rat.her we'd pass out) with
the news.

Delta Sigma Phi hits the news
first, since they’re the brand new
baby of the fraternity world here

at Pitt. Proud papa (Epsilon
chapter at Penn State) initiated
them and announce that its

first name will be Omega.

The ADPi’s are really going to
celebrate Thanksgiving in a big
way with a dance the night be-
fore. (It’s a good thing they have
the next morning in which to
recover.)

But talking about celebrations
they seem to be the main idea
when jackpots are hit. Naturally,
\.e’re speaking about the TPA’s

—who gathered six new pledges and
are staging a riot (dance, that
is) tomorrow night. Another riot
will be held Tuesday with the
Phi Delts.

This week ‘we are proud to
write of more of that real fra-
ternal spirit. The Phi Delts have
invited the Phi Kaps to share
their house with them tomorrow

’ night. A buffet dinner is schedul-
ed and plenty of Penn State Phis
will be on hand to enjoy the local

hospitality (and food). The Phi"

Eps, incidentally, are celebrating
founders day with a home-com-
in.g dance for Penn State brothers.

The welcome mat once more
comes to rest between the SAE
lions of many colors and over it
pass nineteen of Penn State’s ﬁn-
est men (honestly, that’s what the
SAE’s said) to be guests for their
dance tomorrow. '

Chi Omega alumni were assist-

ed at their fashion show last Sat-
urday by the drape shapes of the
Pitt and Tech chapters, we under-
stand. And, incidentally, the Beta
Sigs are moving o-n down to the
Colonial with a pledge dance to-
morrow night. ‘

. terested, in meeting Penn State,

their open house tomorrow. Ev-

a hayride will put an end to
things. _ ’ .

Shut the door they're coming
in the windows! More people with
open houses, namely the Phi Mu
Delta Zetas, Tri Delts, and P1
Lams, and the houses won’t hold
anymore!

Never tired of. being good hosts,
the men of Detal Tau Delta wel
come their brothers from Penn
State for a luncheon ‘..)efore this
tomorrow’s game, a buffet dinner
after the game, and a Victory
(either way) dance to top off
the day’s events.

Oh, to be a sweethear‘ of Sig-
ma Chi, for the Sig dance at
South Park lodge tomorrow looks
like the big item of the week.
The Pitt Sigs have nvited the
State Sigs and boast an orchestra
to make the dance tempos. Notice
to all burglars: We might as well
confess that practically all hous-
es will be open after -the game to-
morrow. It should be a cinch to
make off with a dough—nut, some
coffee, or a woman. Sorry we
have no silzerware.

Band.Post-Game ‘Concerts’

Thrill Bed-Ridden Children

When the ﬁnal whistle has blown in the stadium tomorrow, the

spectators will,

as always, ﬁlter

out of the gates and head for

home. They will miss one of the high points of the day-everyone,
that is, except the tiny population of Qhildren‘s hospital.
Although the game will be over, the Pitt band will Itave one
more concert to play. Director Robert L. Arthur will "n"-arch his
proteges over the cobble stones of DeSoto street to the front of  gray

building, mount a_ wall, and tap 9

his baton f__or attention.

A few interested spectators will
gather, but the music will not be
for them. It will be for sick
youngsters in the windows of
Childrens hospital.

The traditional at‘ter—game con-
cert dates back some 12 or 15
years. A Pitt team was playing in
the stadium and a Pitt band was
there for its half-time maneuvers.

In those days Childrens was the’

closest hospital to the stadium.
Out of what was thought consid-
eration, the band stopped playing
at the end of the game so as not
to disturb the patients.

This practice continued and sev-
eral ot' the bed—ridden children
complained about being -denied the
music they wanted to hear. When
band authorities heard this, they
decided, not only to march past
the hospital, but to stop and give
a special concert, expressly for
the sick children.

Thus, a custom was born, and
ever since that day, Pitt bands,
after each home game, have play-
ed, rain or shine, for the boys
and girls of Childrens hospital.

ists, physicists, geographers, or

Pitt’s current crop of bal1-car-
triers may not be the most decep-
"laive or the most‘ power-laden com-
bination in college ranks today,
butcertainly it is one of the most
versatile.

An abundance of inexperienced
material coupled with a‘ series of
injuries has forced Coach Wes
«Fesler to juggle his ball carriers
to the fullest extent this season.

B o b b y Lee,
from New Cas-
e,lt along with
Jack Smodic of

ship, iwere the
nucleus for "a
speedy running
attack at the
offset of t_he
— season. How-
" * ever, both
Lee s p e e d merch-
ants sutained leg injuries during
early season play and have been
used sparingly ever since.

. ‘With both of these men out,
‘Coach Fesler called on freshman
fullback Bill Bruno, a burly six-
footer, to help out in the left half-
back position. ‘

Following Bruno’s switch to
L halfback, Lindy Lauro was hand-
t ed the fullback chores. Lauro,

who have displayed potentialities.
La Frankie has been an under-

line. Radnor proved his Worth in

Also worth considerable men-
tion is the sparkling work of the

Carl De Pasqua, and Ralph Sho-rt
have done a superb job as Gold

men are freshmen but have pro-
gressed rapidly.

The tall, husky tackle from Tresckow who has been
a rock of defense on the Pitt line for four seasons thus brings
‘to an end a brilliant college grid-

coaches.

Pitt Starting  

Five Remains
  Undetermined

“The starting combination .will
be determined by the players, in-
directly, through their ability‘, ag-
gressiveness, and spirit of play,”

stated Dr. H. C. Carlson, head'-
i mentor of Pitt’s basketball squad.

Competition among the varsity
candidates for the current edition

of the Panthers has" been exceed-

ingly keen. Selecting one standard
quintet may be an impossibility,
and consequently starting lineups
may change frequently.

To cite a speciﬁc example as to
the quality of material, six candi-
dates f-or this year’s squad have
played on the ﬁrst team in pre-
vious campaigns. Nate Apple, team
captain, heads this list, along with

Sam David, Dodo Canterna, Frank .

Morris, Bill Cieply and Wally
Zernich.

In addition to the men men- .

tioned above, several of the can-
didates have been on the squads
of former Pitt teams. Ed Latagli-
ata, Paul Goodwin, and George

, McCrossin were with the 1942-43
‘cage quintets. Steve Shuber was

a member of the ’41-42 Panthers.

Although veteran players of
other years dominate the make—up

~ of the varsity candidates, numer-
gous -freshmen have made their

presence known through eﬂective
play and spirit. Jack Rose, rangy
center from Carrick, has shown
great promise. Coy Allen, one -of
the most proliﬁc scorers in WPIAL
basketball history, has /been.seri—
ously challenging veteran team

members. He hails from ‘Wampum V
; High in New Castle. Ted Stepien,

former all-city of Pittsburgh, /Bill
Brehm, Turtle -Creek ace, and Bob
Biscoe, of B-entleyville, round out
the freshman currently on the
varsity squad. ‘

'. coming to Pitt in 1940. Offers from

22 different schools were his for
the ‘taking but Jack wanted Pitt.
He has never regretted his de-
cision, either, for as he says, “I’ve
met many nice people, made lots
of friends, and most of all got a
good education.”

Freshman ball under Charley

' Bowser came ﬁrst on Jack’s col-

lege football schedule. In ’41 he
earned a ﬁrst string tackle Slot
and it was this year that his big-
gest thrill came. Many Gold and
Blue‘ rooters will probably re-
member that the Panthers pulled

J one of the biggest upsets of 1941-
by beating mighty Fordham, 13-0.

Four of J ack’s' Hazelton team-
mates were performing. for the
Rams, two of W-hom were starring
for the New Yorkers, Schverko
and Joe Andrejco. Fordham enter-
ed the game with a perfect win
record, and seemed to be heading
for Rose Bowl glories. The Pan-

Q thers went‘ out and played their

best game of the season, upsetting
the pre—game predictions by win-

». ning, 13-0. “We couldn’t lose it

because I’d still be hearing about
it at home,” Jack relates.

The Army -Air Corps took up
Jack’s time from March of '43
until January of this year._

Reentering Pitt this summer,
Jack has nothing but praise for
the coaching staff in general this
year. “Coach Fesler’s system of

P friendly and constructive criticism

plus his emphasis on the scholas-
tic ability of his men is going to
put Pitt on top again Within the
next few years,” Jack declared.

Lack of experience on the part
of the freshmen probably lost for
Pitt this year, Jack thinks, but he
adds quickly that thg young Pan-
thers are coming along fast and
nextyear “they won’t be taking
anything from anybody.”

_ There is talk that Jack will be
offered a pro—football contract but
atthe present time he is looking
forward to a business career. Dis-

.‘proving a general belief about

football- players, Jack was an all
“A” student in high school and
will be graduated as an account-
ing major with a two-point aver-
age.

Panthers Meet State  
In Season’s Finale

Golightly '

Does a tough schedule develop’ a better team than playing
mediocre opposition? That question may be answered at the
stadium tomorrow when Pitt and Penn State square-off for

their forty—sixth meeting since

1893.

The Nittany Lions have bagged six wins and dropped one
decision. With the exception of Navy their oppositionhas been

far from top crust. Penn State’s¢

lone loss was to Michigan State,
19-16. The Lions rolled over Buck-
nell, Syracuse, Colgate, Fordham,
Temple, and Navy.

Pitt has lost ﬁve, tied one, and 1

won two.

Penn State has the best defen-
sive record in college football. In
seven games the Nittany Lions
have yielded 977 yards to both
ground and aerial attacks, an av-

erage yield of 19.6 yards per

game. They have limited oppon-
ents to_76.4 yards per game aver-
age from rushing. ‘

_Elwood Petchel, Bobby Wil-
liams, Manny Weaver, Jeff Dur-
kota, Joe Colone, Wallace Trip-
lett, and Larry Joe run behind a
line which averages 200 pounds.
Durkota and Williams excel at
running off guard and tackle.
Triplett is their best pass receiver
and is Very dangerous on reverses.

Fullback Joe Colone does the
bulk of the punting with an oc-
casional assist from Petchel; The

.150-pound Petchel handles the

passing and is a constant running
threat. *

Larry Joe, injured earlier in the
season, is a dangerous climax run-
ner. Against Pitt in 1942 he re-
turned the second half kickoff 90
yards for a touchdown and State
triumphed, 14-6.

Seven starters in the State line-
up hail from Western Pennsyl-
vania. ' 4 .
