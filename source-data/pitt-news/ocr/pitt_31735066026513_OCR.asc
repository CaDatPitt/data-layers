Pitt’s Board of Trustees will
announce today the design expenses
for the Convocation Center.

The Board’s Property and
Facilities Committee has been very
quiet about the progress of the cen-
ter but did announce last week that
the Commonwealth P has chosen
Pittsburgh and Atlanta—based com-
panies to co-design Pitt’s new $52
million Convocation Center.

Apostolou Associates” of Mount
Washington and Rosser
International of Atlanta were chosen
from among 10 other firms to design
the 12,500-seat arena complete with
food court, retail area and luxury
boxes.

The center may also include a
glass enclosed walkway so people
can enjoy the panoramic hilltop
view of Oakland while they walk to
their seats.

Paul Apostolou, president of
Apostolou Associates, said they and

Rosser Int. have been chosen by the
state to draw the blueprints for the
center, but that’s the extent of the
progress.

He added that he hasn’t met with
the University or the
Commonwealth yet to find out
exactly what they want in the blue-
prints.

He said his company has worked
with Rosser in the past and that the
two companies will make a good
designing team for the center
because Rosser specializes in sports
complexes, especially basketball
courts.

“They know how to do the lay-
out of the ﬂoor, place the lights, and
the seating arrangement,” Apostolou
said. “They [Rosser] have a whole
department that does just that. Then
we’ll both collaborate on the rest of
the center.” ’

City Council approves giant
dinosaur at Carnegie Museum

Jason Galllnger

Assistant News Editor

The Cathedral of Learning is the
tallest academic structure in the
western hemisphere. Phipp’s
Conservatory can wow ﬂower
enthusiasts with its arched glass
roofs and Victorian architecture.
And there may soon be another
landmark coming to Oakland to set
this section of the city apart from
the rest.

Last month, the Carnegie
Museum - of Natural History
announced a tentative plan to build
a life-size model of a dinosaur
along Forbes Avenue. The model of
a diplodocus, measuring 80 feet
long and roughly 20 feet high,
would be located in front of the
museum complex near Bellefield
Avenue.

Carnegie spokeswoman Sandy
Lepri said the museum would like
to have the model completed by
July 4, 1999, the 100th anniversary
of the first discovery of a complete
diplodocus skeleton.

The diplodocus was a p1ant*~—eat-
ing dinosaur of the Jurassic period,
approximately 208 to 144 million
years ago. Living primarily in the
water, they had four short legs, a
long neck with a small head, and a
long tail used for propulsion. A
diplodocus could weigh up to 80
tons.

An expedition of fossil hunters
commissioned by Andrew Carnegie
made the first diplodocus discovery
in 1899. Carnegie financed many
fossil hunting endeavors in an effort
to make his museum stand apart
from others around the world.

Today, the Carnegie Museum of
Natural History is the only museum
in the world to have two complete
diplodocus skeletons.‘

Lepri said the idea for the model
came from the anniversary of the
diplodocus discovery and the fact
that Andrew Carnegie was involved.

The Carnegie is also hoping that
the dinosaur would provide a recog-
nizable symbol to announce the
museum’s presence, Lepri said.

“Right now people driving by
don’t realize they’re at the muse-
um,” she said. “In Oakland there are
a lot of tall, beautiful buildings that
aren’t marked clearly. The dinosaur
would be a form of fun signage to
announce our building.”

‘Pittsburgh City Council has
given its approval for the project.
But according to Lepri, the museum
has not made final plans to build the
dinosaur.

At issue is the cost of the fiber-
glass model. Lepri was unable to
cite a specific figure but did say the
cost would be “considerable.”

To raise money for the project,
the Carnegie is considering a vari-
ety of fund-raising campaigns. One
in particular involves a “grass
roots” activity where local school
children could donate $1 and have
their names commemorated on a
plaque near the model, Lepri said.

With their ambitious desire to
have the model completed in just
over a year, Lepri said museum offi-
cials will have to make a fund rais-
ing decision in the near future.

Pitt freshman Melissa Lukan
also expressed concern over the
amount of money the Carnegie

New dorms to

come for Pitt

Pitt’s Board of Trustees will hold a
public meeting today and although they
refused to announce the itinerary, they are
expected to armounce plans to build new
dorms.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said he
couldn’t elaborate, saying the Board of
Trustees wants to make any announce-
ments themselves before people read
about it in the paper.

The University has been working on
the housing problem since last fall, when
they had to turn Sutherland Hall living
rooms into additional dorm rooms
because of a housing shortage.

When Pitt announced plans to build
the Convocation Center in January,
Service said the University was also mov-
ing along on plans to build more dorms.

Ana Guzman, associate vice chancel-
lor at Facilities Management, was unavaﬂ—
able for comment about possible
announcements at the meeting.

At today’s meeting, the Board of
Trustees will discuss the following capital
projects for approval:

0 New student housing.

0 Design expenses for the Convocation
Center.

. - Renovations of existing athletic facil-

_ ities.

- Construction of new outdoor playing
ﬁelds and tennis courts.

0 Upgrades to several building sys-
tems.

The meeting will be today at 11:30
a.m. in 2P56 Forbes Quad and is open to
all students and faculty.

Pitt assistant
professor wins

Young Investigator
Award

Clifton Callaway, M.D., Ph.D., recent-
ly received the Young Investigator Award
from the Society of Academic Emergency
Medicine.

Callaway, an assistant professor in the
Department of Emergency Medicine at
Pitt, is currently working on ways to min-
imize brain damage during sudden cardiac
arrest.

He was nominated by emergency
medicine faculty members at Pitt.

Candidates for the award came from
around the country. According to a Center
for Emergency Medicine press release,
candidates had to display promise and dis-
tinction in emergency medicinal research,
including signiﬁcant collaborative work
with a senior clinical scientist, academic
accomplishments and published research.

All work had to be completed within
seven ' years of graduation from medical
residency training. -

“I have never met a more motivated,

thoughtful, young academian in my pro-
fessional career,” said Paul Paris, chair-
man of Pitt’s Department of Emergency
Medicine. “Dr. Calloway is a credit to the
speciality of emergency medicine.”

Pitt’s Faculty Senate
has a new president

Pitt faculty voted to elect Nathan
Hershey "as the new president of the
University Senate.

Hershey is a professor of health law in
the Graduate School of Public Health. He
will begin his one-year term, replacing
current president Gordon MacLeod, on
July 1.

PHEAA Board
increases state
grant awards

The Board of Directors of the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA) took
action that will allow an additional
6,000 Pennsylvania students to
receive state grant awards.

Beginning with the 1998-99 school
year, approximately 148,000 students
will receive state grant awards, which
are‘ issued according to a student’s
financial need and which do not have

to be repaid.
“A highly effective state grant pro-
gram is vital to the ‘ many

Pennsylvania students who face finan-
cial challenges in their pursuit of a
higher education,” said PHEAA
Chairman Elinor Z. Taylor. “[This]
action enables PHEAA to continue
making the most efficient use of limit-
ed financial resources to ensure as
many students as possible are eligible
for assistance.”

Gov. Tom Ridge has increased
funding for the program in the state
budget. The PHEAA board adjusted
the formula it uses to assess a stu-
dent’s financial eligibility for state
grant awards to ensure that a maxi-
mum number of students can take
advantage of the increased funding.

The formula changes include
increasing the maximum grant award
from $2,700 to $2,900 for full—time
students and from $1,350 to $1,450
for part—time students.

The board also reduced the amount
a student’s family must contribute
toward college tuition.

The average grant for 1998-99 is
expected to be $2,078, which is about
$115 more than last year.

PHEAA will notify students of
their grant awards later this month.

BRADFORD

Young’s book has nothing to do with
her classes.

According to Young’s statement,
“As it is accepted practice for profes-
sors to require their books in class, I
didn’t realize the potential harm that
could stem from making an offer to
use [the purchase of] my book as
extra credit.” A

Young made the offer to her
classes, including Abnormal
Psychology and Introduction to
Psychology, during the week of
March 17, 1998. On March 23, "she
met with her immediate supervisor,
Warren Fass, chairman of the Natural
Science Division of Pitt-Bradford.

“In our conver-
sation,” Young’s

explained that I
lacked good judge-
ment in this situa-
tion and it was con-
cluded that I would
remedy the situa-
tion immediately.”

Fass refused to
comment.
Young then

announced to her
classes that the pur-
chase of “Caught in
the Net” would not
count for any extra
credit. But didn’t
say whether she’
would offer refunds
to any students who bought the book
and then found out they couldn’t get
bonus points. I

“I made a formal statement in all
of my classes that the purchase of my
book was not to be used for extra
credit,” the statement read. “I apolo-
gized for any inconvenience this may
have caused and thanked them for
understanding. Final grades were not
affected in any way with the purchase
or non-purchase of my book.”

“We could buy the book for_extra
credit,” said Sherry Heitzenrater, one
of the students in the Abnormal
Psychology course, “then she told us

we couldn’t.

Young later said she just received
some bad advice in offering the extra
credit. It ended up with some unin-
tentional consequences, she added.

“I made a bad error while trying
to do something beneficial to my stu-
dents,” she said. “I know I am an eth-
ical person and I felt like I tried to
handle it in the best way possible,”

Baker said she is convinced the
letter Young se-nt her is accurate.
Young and Fass have both confirmed
that grades were not affected.

“I’m satisfied with that,” Baker
said. “If someone believes any differ-
ently, he or she should use the acade-

mic integrity
, process.”

Baker pointed
out that no griev—,
ances have been
filed by students
and at this time the
college has no fur-
ther plans to look
into the incident.

Final grades
were mailed to stu-
dents the week of
April 27.

“We’re all
humans, whether
we are students,
faculty of staff, and
don’t always do
things perfectly,”
Baker said. “Dr.
Young is a really good faculty mem-
ber, and this was just a misstep of a
young assistant professor.”

Young’s statement concluded by
underscoring that “maintaining stan-
dards of academic integrity is of
great importance to me and that I am
proud to work within a University
that maintains such high ethical stan-
dards.” A

Young joined the Pitt-Bradford
faculty in 1996. She earned her
Psy.D. and a masters from Indiana
University of PA and a B.S. in busi-
ness administration from SUNY
Buffalo.

museum would spend on the model.

“It would probably be such an
expensive thing to build,” she said.
“I think the money could go to other
things.” .

Lukan said some of her friends
have had biology classes at the
Carnegie and were bored while in
the museum. She also said she could
imagine visitors being bored there,
and suggested the Carnegie use the
money for projects to make the
museum more exciting.

Lukan did, however, say the
dinosaur would be “pretty neat” and

FROM PAGE 2

that she would stop by to see it if it
were built.

Carnegie museum officials have
also expressed concern that vandal-
ism by roaming teenagers or even
Pitt students could damage the
dinosaur if the model were built.
Lepri, however, dismissed the idea
that Carnegie officials are worried
about Pitt students.

“Any time you build anything
outside, there is always the threat
for Vandalism,” Lepri said. “We
aren’t necessarily worried about Pitt
students specifically.”

University of PA’s new athletic
facility, among others.

Rosser" International helped
design Penn State’s Bryce Jordan
Center as well as a new athletic cen-
ter at the University of Arkansas.

Pennsylvania Governor Tom
Ridge announced last January the
state’s intention to give Pitt $138
million for capital improvements,
$38 million of which will go to
building the Convocation Center.

The center is expected to take
five years to build and combined
with a planned academic center will
likely create nearly 200 jobs at Pitt.

Originally, the University’s
Facilities Management was in con-

trol of finding the designers and
builders, hiring Pittsburgh based
designer L.D. Astorino & Associates
and HOK Sports Facilities Group of
Kansas City. .

But the Commonwealth took the
reins when Ridge announced the
$38 million grant for the center, fir-
ing Astorino and HOK and hiring
Apostolou and Rosser.

Lou Astorino, Chairman of
Astorino & Assoc. refused to com-
ment about the turn of events, but
did say, “It’s a dead issue and we
wish Pitt the very best.”

The Board of Trustees will
announce details about the
Convocation Center today at their
Trustees Property and Facilities
Committee Meeting.

Book-for-points offer
blatant oppurtunism

In a move best described as blatant oppor-
tunism, Kimberly Young, an assistant professor of
psychology at Pitt-Bradford, tried to irrrplement a
scheme to give students 10 bonus points if they
bought her book, “Caught in the ‘Net”

The book, which would lighten her students’
wallets by $22.95, deals with Internet addiction and
hasnothingtodowiththeclassessheteaches:
Abnormal Psychology and Introduction to

oifer.

Though she apologized for the mistake, retract-
ed her statements, and Pitt-Bradford has dismissed
theincident, she saidthatshemadeabaderrorwhile
trying to do something beneﬁcial for her students.

have made a big dent in anyone’s grade. Guess she
doesn’t pay much attention to contradiction in her
classes.

doesn’t contain material coveredin the course, how
are these bonus points beneﬁcial to the students?
Was she attempting an experiment in “sucker psy-
chology’ perhaps?

While Georgetown University Economics pro-
fessor Vrkram Seth wrote a critically-acclairned epic
novel set in India (“A Suitable Boy”), it would be
totally useless to his student who wants clariﬁcation
on certain economic theories.

FAS Dean: ”Education & Research balanced”

Peter Koehler
FAS Dean
I feel compelled to comment
on the recent column by Opinions
Editor Kris Kissel (“Higher
Learning? Think Again. Just

' Research.” The Pitt News, April

16, 1998). Mr. Kissel used a few
carefully selected (by whom? I
wonder) quotes from external and
internal reviews of the Biological
Sciences Department conducted
in 1985 and 1997 to support a
number of increasingly sweeping
assertions. Having served as FAS
dean since 1986, I know that these
assertions are at variance with the
facts.

“Pitt did nothing to improve
the quality of education for under-
graduates in biology” during the
intervening 12 years. —— In fact,
the faculty in the Biological
Sciences Department has devised
and implemented many improve-
ments to the department’s under-
graduate programs during this
time. For example: a new (and
popular) major in Ecology and
Evolution was put in place; the
majors in Biochemistry and
Biophysics were revised; a two-
term. biology course for non-
majors was introduced; a five-
year grant worth a total of $1.7
million was obtained from the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute
for the improvement of under-
graduate science education
through the development of new
courses, the introduction of new
educational technology, support
for undergraduate research partic-
ipation, and better advising; con-
siderable investments of manpow-
er and facilities have been made
so that the Pymatuning
Laboratory of Ecology can now

provide a substantial number of
undergraduate students with a
valuable field experience. These
(and other) improvements were

. noted favorably in the 1997 exter-

nal review of the department.

“It even appears that Pitt
worked to perpetuate this imbal-
ance of priorities by continuing to
reward research more than it
rewards teaching.” —— In fact, the
criteria for the advancement of
tenure stream and tenured faculty
in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences at Pitt are based on the
expectation that faculty members
perform well in teaching _a_r_1_d
research. Failure to do so in either
area is grounds for denying pro-
motion. Research and teaching are
regarded as closely related faculty
activities because a faculty mem-
ber who does not engage in the
former cannot stay up to date in
the latter. This is especially true in
a field that is changing as rapidly
as biology. A survey of any group
of FAS department chairs who
have prepared and presented such
promotion cases during my years
as dean will confirm the quality of
the candidates’ teaching perfor-

smance is in fact more carefully

scrutinized now than it used to be.
The evaluation of teaching also
takes into account that some of
the most valuable learning takes
place outside the classroom: The
faculty members of the Biology
Department have been among the
most active in FAS to welcome
undergraduate students into their

ences.

“This symptom — that under-
graduate education is largely
ignored —— pervades not just biol-
ogy, not just the natural sciences,

not even just the University of
Pittsburgh; it plagues institutions

of higher learning across the
country.” ‘— I agree with Mr.
Kissel that research universities

like Pitt must pay more attention

to undergraduate education. But I
find it unfortunate that he is
ignoring the fact that this has been
a major objective in FAS for sev-

eral years already. The FAS Long— ~
Range Planning Document —~

Phase 11 (prepared in April 1995)
spelled out the following specific
goals for undergraduate educa-
tion:

- Develop a new culture with-
in the Faculty of Arts
Sciences by emphasizing, recog-
nizing, supporting and rewarding
faculty involvement in undergrad-
uate education.

- Review and update the

undergraduate curriculum and

build
bridges.

0 Improve teaching facilities
and technology-based instruction-
al support.

- Extend and enhance the
undergraduate educational experi-
ence.

During the past three years,
significant resources have been

new interdisciplinary

reallocated within FAS to advance
these goals. (The anxieties that
these actions produced in some

parts of FAS have been amply
reported in The Pitt News.)
Improvements similar to the ones

detailed above for Biological
Sciences have been instituted in
many other FAS departments 1

since
1995. For example: the teaching
of all undergraduate statistics

courses has been restructured and

THE Pm EWS

cigar-smoking in Pittsburgh

Dave
Madden

A Hollywood executive
has just ﬁnished the details of
a $50 million picture deal. He
sits back, satisfied with his
business tactics and the money
he’ll be raking in soon, once
this baby hits the theaters.
How does he celebrate yet
another tidal wave of cash
ﬂow? He opens the $300 cigar
box on his desk, lights one up
and puffs away, looking up at
the ceiling and watching his
putrid smoke ﬂoat, up above
him. How angelic. . .

Here in the ‘Burgh, we
have a little cigar haven right
in Market Square called
Market Street Cigar Shoppe
(note the cute colonial spelling
of the word “shop”), where the
various businessmen of the
downtown area can go after
work, or, for the die-hard cigar
fans, during a lunch break, to
smoke up among friends and
talk about the various mergers
they orchestrated or how they
just might be able to get that
house in the Poconos they’ve
been working so hard to buy.

Just this past semester,
three of , our wonderfully
diverse fraternities had a
“cigar smoker” as one of their
rush events. Two of the frater-
nities were so clever as to add
some subs to the menu and call
it “Hoagies and Stogies!” One
can’t help but picture some
disillusioned freshman going
to these events, being offered a
@l0—20 cigar and thinking,

“Wow, I’m part of the elite,
this is great!”

Hey kid, it’s time to wake
up‘ no matter what
Hollywood or any other glam-
orous corporate white guys tell
you, cigars aren’t cool.
They’re just the nation’s hot
new trend of elitism. In the
eighties we had all the “fitness
spas” that opened up in busi-

a Gingrich-esque America;
The cigar embodies the idea of
being rich and loving it, which
is a fine idea for those who
actually are rich and

do love it, but

and younger start

have fully achieved the above goals,
neither in Biological Sciences nor
throughout FAS, but we are well on
our way.

What is so disappointing about
Mr. Kissel’s column is that he did not
make any effort to find out what was
going on before expressing his opin-
ion. All the faculty members
throughout FAS who are working
hard to enhance the educational
experience of our undergraduate stu-
dents deserve fairer reporting than
that. Mr; Kissel needs to learn to do
his homework if he wants to realize
his goal of becoming FAS dean one
day.

Strap on that jammy pack, hide
your valuables, and head to Grafﬁti this
Thursday, because Gene and Dean Ween
are broke according to Herald The
Boognish — the tongue-in-cheek online
Ween—zine. _

The Boognish says that the band
has decided to hit a few of its often-
rnissed locales for a brief tour this spring
in order to support Gene’s $5,000 a day
cough syrup habit. Herald reported that
they hope to relieve your car of a few

possessions while you’re inside the all-
ages show. g

Before you decide not to show up
though, keep in mind that the band mem-
bers don’t expect fans to take them too
seriously. In the liner notes of Ween’s
1991 release, The Pod (Shimmy Disc)
the band claimed to have recorded tl1ou—
sands of hours of tape while under the
inﬂuence of Scotch Guard bong hits.
Before long, kids started popping up at
shows with cans of Scotch Guard, and
passing out on the ﬂoor. Ween expressed
surprise that anyone would actually be
stupid enough to inhale the stuff.

Next to their sense of humor,
Ween’s most outstanding characteristic is
a sly versatility. The band segues pain-
lessly between noise—pur1k tracks like
“Papa Zit” on GodWeenSatan

   

ith food, disease and romance

(Twin/Tone 1990) and soulful instru-
mentals like “A Tear For Eddie” (dedi-
cated to Eddie Hazel of P—Fur1k fame) on
Chocolate and Cheese (Elektra 1993).
In 1996, they traveled to Nashville to
record 12 Golden Country Greats
(Elektra), a full—ﬂedged country album
with some of the best studio musicians in
the business.

Ween’s most recent release, The
Mollusk (Elektra, 1997) marks a retum to
the band’s practice of writing in the stu-
dio. “Pink Eye (On My Leg)” is a tradi-
tional Ween song, in the way it uses a dis-
ease for a song title, and sounds like a
drum-machine demo on nitrous oxide.
‘5It’s Gonna Be (Alright)’’ is a heartfelt
break—up ballad, “The Golden Eel”

Here comes 'I'ooIs — the IICII

By BRETT TAYLOR

Toots Thielemans comes from a tra-
ditional jazz background, but he is by no
means a traditional jazz instrumentalist —
he plays a harmonica.

This Friday and Saturday,
Thielemans will use his harmonica to turn
Manchester Craftsman’s Guild into Chez
Toots, the title of his new album, translat-
ed as Toots’ Place.

Born in Brussels, Belgium,
Thielemans’ parents owned one of those
quaint sidewalk cafes complete with a
strolling accordion player, providing the
inﬂuence for Thielemans to pick up the
accordion himself at age four.

He later moved to France, but when
the Nazis moved in, he moved out and
went back to Brussels where he played the
guitar in clubs for American soldiers.
Somewhere between France and
Belgium, Thielemans discovered the vir-
tuoso Belgian—gypsy guitarist Django
Reinhardt. Reinhardt’s inﬂuence reached
him so much that he even played a few
times with Django’s partner, violinist
Stephane Grapelli.

However, as Bebop became popular,
Thielemans turned back to the harmonica.
He developed a unique style that made
him good enough to jam with one of the
greatest saxophonists ever, Charlie Parker.

A week after his duet with Parker,

while playing in Philadelphia with trum-

peter Miles Davis, pianist George
Shearing discovered Thielemans and in
the nine years that followed helped him
become one of the most recognized jazz-

harmonica players ever. He went on to
play with Ella Fitzgerald, Paul Simon,
Billy Joel and others.

Chez Toots brings it all home as
Thielemans splices his Djangoesque-
Belgian roots with traditional French
waltzes and marches, as well as modern
jazz.

The ﬁrst song, “Sous le Ciel de
Paris,” recorded live at the Savoy Cafe in
Hollywood, takes you quickly back to that
Belgian cafe. Maestro Marcel Azzola is
the featured guest accordionist on the
smooth waltz. Even those who don’t like
waltzes will ﬁnd their foot tapping out the
three beat rhythm of the song and hum-
ming the ageless melody. This tune makes
you thirsty for wine.

“Dance For Victor,” the fourth song
on the album, goes back to that Django
Reinhardt Belgian swing feel. It
bounces gently in the same happy yet
mysterious manner, but takes a complete-
ly dilferent turn with Thielemans’ har-
monica; Here he shows off his improvi-
sation skills, performing an extended solo
interrupted momentarily by guest guitarist
and composer Phillip Catherine.

“Valse No. 2” incorporates yet ,.
another inﬂuence, namely, classicalf

music. It is truly amazing how naturally -
the harmonica, a traditionally folk and‘
blues instrument, ﬂows with the sur- . .9
real melody of the suing arrange- 
ment. Thielemans also succeeds  ‘h
with this song where many _-‘
people fail miserably. He.
combines jazz and classical "
music and he does it almost

By JAKE WOMER

Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables is an
enduring novel that spawned a
Broadway musical, plays and several
ﬁlms — the last one just a couple years
ago. With the sprawling tale of Jean
Valjean’s redemption and
salvation ever-present in all
of these forms, there is little
to be gained by a new film
version.

Nonetheless, talented
director Bille August (Pelle
the Conqueror) assembled an
impressive and seasoned cast
for an all new Les Miserables. Liam
Neeson brings the acting chops that he
showed in Schindler’s List and Michael
Collins to the role of Valjean. Academy
Award winner Geoffrey Rush exempli-
fies malevolence as J avert, Valjean’s
nemesis. Uma Thurman is capable as the
tortured Fantine while Claire Danes
plays her typical coming—of—age role as
Cosette.

For the uninitiated, a young starv-
ing Valjean is imprisoned for 19 years for
stealing a loaf of bread. Javert is one of
his jailors. Paroled in 1812, Valjean ben-
eﬁts from a gift of silver which he uses to
straighten himself out. He becomes the

evokes mental anguish, and “Waving My
Dick I11 The Win ” is a sentimental tune
about reunited lovers. Well, it’s sentimental
for Ween’s style.

Other recent projects include a track on
the upcoming X—Files movie soundtrack,
and a collaboration with The Boredomes
known as Z—Rock Hawaii (Nip Guitar
Records 1997).

When Ween performs live, they
alledgedly tend to consume massive quanti-
ties of alcohol. However, this doesn’t stop

mayor and savior of the small town of
Vigau and adopts a new identity, violat-
ing his parole. It works until Javert is
appointed police inspector of Vigau; then
Javert backs Valjean into a corner until
he has no choice but to expose his iden-
tity. Fantine and her daughter, Cosette
are caught in Valjean’s
struggle for redemption in
the face of Javert’s obses-
sion to capture him.

But problems arise
when so much story has to
be crammed into a 134-
minute package. August’s
version begins with Valjean
leaving prison, and so thetheft of bread
and the indignities of prison are only
shown in ﬂashbacks, if at all. The audi-
ence also is left wondering about the rea-
sons for Valjean and Javart’s antagonistic
relationship.

Cinematographer Jorgen Persson,
however, successfully employs muted
tones to illustrate the dark mood encom-
passing the land and complementing the
tale.

Despite solid efforts and a killer
cast, the ﬁlm is not fresh enough to be
anything more than an updated version
of Les Mis for the attention—deﬁcit—disor—
der audience.

them from tearing out three-hour shows that
span the entire breadth of their material.

As in the past, fans are still encouraged
to bring food for the band, but only if it’s
something good like ﬁlet mignon. Dean and
Gene are tired of getting canned meat prod-
ucts and junk food.

It’s not often that the Brothers Ween
ﬁnd the time to bring their unique form of
genre—bending, mind—altering music to our
humble city, so take advantage of this rare
chance to see them in all their drunken glory.

Men with Guns
is a good thing

The world can be a terrible place
where men are murdered, women are
raped and children starve to death.

In John Sayles’ new ﬁlm Men with
Guns, an aging Dr. Humberto Fuentes
(Frederico Luppi) leams these lessons
in a single road trip. When he leaves his

1‘ Mercedes behind to visit former stu-

dents, he is immersed in the jungles of
hi country. Fuentes

 believes in the
benevolence of
mankind until
he sees the
aftermath of the
men with guns.
The army and

   
  

guerilla ﬁghters have ravaged the land

and murdered or assaulted ‘most of its
inhabitants. A

Sayles directs with a slow hand,
allowing events to unfold before the
camera instead of employing sudden
edits to give the illusion of more action.
His direction is more like observation.
As one of the best independent ﬁlm-
makers in the nation, his screenplay is

i one that should be viewed —— carefully.

Sayles uses sub-titles rather than on1it—
ting Fuentes’ Spanish language, adding
realism.

By JAKE WOMER

Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman
and Shaquille O’Nei1 might be able to
teach Ray Allen a thing ortwo on the
basketball courts, but they need to take
lessons from him on the big screen.
Allen makes one NBA star who can act
and even hold his own with Denzel
Washington. But let’s not forget that
it’s Spike Lee’s game.

With his new ﬁlm He Got Game,
Lee once again shows that he can play.
Just don’t give him the ball in the ﬁnal

minute because” he’ll likely blow the

game if he plays basketball like he
makes movies. - ,

' _Writer-director Lee puts his talent
on display with this strikingly poignant
basketball ﬂick. Allen plays Jesus

. Shuttlesworth, the nation’s top high-

school “basketball prospect.
Washington plays his father, Jake
Shuttlesworth,’ imprisoned for killing
his wife and Jesus’ mother. He is
released for a week with a possible par-
don to go with Jesus to the govemor’s
alma mater (feel free to suspend disbe-
lief here). Obviously, Jesus has not for-
given his father or forgotten his crime.

Lee sets up serious tension
between Jesus and Jake, Jesus and the

and Jake are particularly
effective because of the
actors’ talents. But scenes

serve to show Jake getting his rocks

pose. ,

Further lapses show the ﬁlm to be

worse when Lee violates the f1lm’s
realism. A basketball is thrown over a

icbond between father and son.

struct new parks for the Steelers and
Pirates right now. Many people think
these new buildings will not make any dif-
ference, but they could in many ways if
they are built.

In Atlanta, because of the pregame
events and pep rallies, the Braves are able
to draw huge crowds to every game. I had
a great time in Ted Turnerland.

I Past the center ﬁeld bleachers, there is
a concourse with food vendors, games
and many other things for families to do.
The stadium has machines that sell tokens
so people can enjoy these many diver-
sions.

The Braves’ organization hires people
to run these games, and every worker I
encountered was bright and cheery - as
opposed to those we have here in
Pittsburgh. In Atlanta, the workers want
the fans to have a good time, and they
demonstrate this by having a good time
themselves.

V A new stadium in Pittsburgh would
mean many things for the city and the
Pirates. First of all, Pittsburgh would see a
rise in tourism Atlanta has many attrac-

. tions for people to see, but currently

Pittsburgh has very little tourism.
Nobody comes to Pittsburgh to see any-
thing The city needs an attraction to draw
people in, and the new stadium would be
a great way‘ to get people to come to
Pittsburgh.

A new stadium would also spur the
economic growth that so many politicians
say is needed in our area. For example,
restaurant business would increase.
Restaurants would have the opportunity to
move near the stadium in a proposed mall.

This new mall would be anchored by

a major department store and would hope- .

fully feature a na1:ionally—known attraction

I such as a Planet Hollywood. Although

these plans are still sketchy, they would
certainly add to the Pittsburgh Experience.
If there isn't not room near the stadi-
um, restaurants may have the chance to
stay where they are and connect with the
fans via a proposed light rail system. The
rail system would connect the North Side
and the South Side in a three- or four-

minute trip.

The Pittsburgh men’s and women’s
track teams traveled to the Big East
Tournament last weekend, with
Pittsburgh ﬁnishing 42 points behind
Big East champions, the Miami
Hurricanes. ’ ' .

The women came home with sec-
ond place overall and an Outstanding
Field Performer for Trecia Smith, while

place with Georgetown winning the
conference title.

“We were beaten by a really good 

team. There is a difference between
feeling like you lost and feeling like
you got beat. We got beat. We ran as
well as we could have, but we just did
not have the athletes to make thediffer-

ence,” said Assistant Coach Dave 

Sobal.

The highest ﬁnish by the men was
a second place by Ron Losiewicz in the
discus throw. The women took home
ﬁve ﬁrst place ﬁnishes.

Gina Bundy won the heptathalon

for the Lady Panthers, while Belinda 5;
Lee ﬁmshed thlrdv 87 Pmms behmd year lorlthe most conference titles for an individual.

Smith took ﬁrst place honors in both
the triple jump and the shot put, giving
Pittsburgh a seven-point lead over Rutgers
after ﬁve events.

   
    
   

Miami took the lead after the 13th
event, the long jump. Smith ﬁnished sec-
ond in this event, with Miami taking posi-
tions one, three and four.

“Smith was a little disappointed in

fatigued,” said Sobal.
Chantee Earl won the 800-meter race,

but the Lady Panthers still found them-
selves 19 points behind the Hurricanes.
Pittsburgh achieved its last win with the
3200—meter relays, but still couldn't catch
the powerful Hurricanes.

“Earls’ 800 race was a work of art

’ and a race ‘of beauty. She did is as
well as she could have on that day. .
She was really something,” said
Sobal.

With Srr1ith’s performance, she
earned All-Conference honors in
the long jump. She owns 11/Big
East titles, only three behind the
school record held‘ by present

Smith will be back for onemore
year and should look forward to
tying or breaking that mark.

Lee and Joetta Porter also took
All—Big East honors in the hep-
tathalon and 400—meter hurdles
respectively. ‘ H

The men did not fare as well as a
team, though they earned several

cus throw for the second year in a

NCAA says athletes can work, but they don’t have time

Brian Knavish
Asslstant Sports Edltor

The NCAA recently passed a ruling

« allowing athletes to work a part-time job

during their athletic season. But judging
by athletes’ reactions, the resolution

seems about as practical as giving a scuba ‘

diver a book of matches so he can see in
those dark underwater caverns.

“I don’t know how it’s going to be
possible unless you work the midnight
shift,” Pitt football player Seth Homack
said. “I spend about six hours a day in the
stadium during football season. There’s
practice, but we also watch ﬁlms before
practice and lift all the time. VV1th classes
and studying, I just don’t see how you
could [work, too].”

The ruling addresses the problem that
many student athletes have: no spending
money during the season (athletes have
always been permitted to work during
their off—season). A student’s meals are
usually covered in his or her scholarship,
but sometimes athletes have no money
above and beyond that to be used for
entertainment or shopping purposes.

“I’ve always been in favor of this leg-

islation,” said Pitt Athletics Director
Steve Pederson. “I don’t think a student
athlete should be penalized for being a

L student athlete. I don’t know that many

will work, but I think they should have the
opportunity to work if they desire and live
a normal college life.”

The main argument against allowing
a student athlete to work is the element of
time. Many feel that an athlete’s sport is
their job and their pay comes in the form
of his or her scholarship.

“I’m not in favor of [the ruling] ,” said
Roland Sturk, head coach of Pitt's
women’s soccer team. “I understand the
plight of athletes who want to have the
same opportunity as any other student on
campus to work and make money, but I
think it’s bad to have that decision in front
of you.”

“There’s already a three part equation
athletes use to balance their time. There’s
a percentage devoted to athletics, a per-

centage devoted to academics, and a per- .

centage devoted to social life. If you
throw work into that equation, I’m not
sure how it will be good for the student.”

Student athletes seem to agree that

the ruling is pointless because of the

intense time constraints that come with
college athletics.

“I think it’s great for anyone who can
handle it,” Pitt soccer player Megan
Beasley explains. ‘There’s just no way I
could have the time to take on a job dur-
ing soccer season.”

Pitt wrestler Nick Mengerink agrees,
“I can’t imagine anyone doing that during
wrestling season. There’s just no time.”

“I think it could have a negative
effect for anyone that does it. Working a
job on top of everything else would cut
into your studying time or your sleeping
time.”

So if this approach doesn’t really
solve the problem of an athlete’s lack of
spending money, what should be done‘?
Many feel that paying student athletes
additional money is a better alternative.

“I wouldn’t want to see the athletes
get paid a salary, but including a $2000
‘living expenses’ category on top of their
tuition, room and board and books and
fees as a part of their scholarship might
work,” Sturk said.

“I don’t think it’s a bad idea for there
to be away for guys to get some spending

in theBig East Tournament

Patrick Robertson
Sports edltor

The Pittsburgh tennis team traveled to
the Big East Toumament April 23-26 and
came home with an 11tl1 place ﬁnish, but
with a great deal accomplished.

The University of Miami won the Big
East Championship while Notre Dame ﬁn-
ished second and Syracuse ﬁnished third

The Lady Panthers faced Syracuse in
the ﬁrst round and quickly lost 4-0.

“Syracuse had a lot of talent They had
a lot of foreign players that were champi-
onship caliber players. They played a great

tournament,” Lady Panther Head Coach

George Dieffenbach said

The Big East Tournament is played on
a seven point system The teams play three
doubles matches. The team that wins two of
those three matches receives one point. The
singles matches each count as one point.

The Panthers lost the doubles point to
Syracuse and also lost their ﬁrst three sin-

gles matches to end the ﬁrst round for Pitt.

The Lady Panthers went on to play
Providence in the second round after
Rutgers beat the Lady Friars in the ﬁrst
round

Pittsburgh put a great deal of impor-
tance on this match since Providence beat
them handily, 6-1 earlier in the season.

“The girls were up for the match. The’

girls thought we could have played them
closer this spring,” Dielfenbach said.

The Panthers’ doubles team of Erin
Shalbrack and
Fran Davis won

came back and took the second set 7-5 to
force a third set. In the third, Hoffman took
an early 5-3 lead and had a match point but
could not capitalize.

She was forced to a tiebreaker which
she led 6-3 but lost 7-6.

“You have to give credit to her oppo-
nent. She perfonned under pressure, but
Amanda [Hoffman] lifted her game and
gave it all she had,” Dietfenbach said

The Lady Panthers faced the
University of Connecticut in their ﬁnal
match of the weekend for 11th place. Pitt
won easily 4-0.

The women who have played since
early September have a great deal to take
from the close match with Providence,
according to their coach.

“Providence is the match to deﬁne our
season. It was close; we fought hard and
kept or composure, but the bounces just did-
n’t go our way,” Dieffenbach said
Pittsburgh ﬁnished 16-9 overall and 3-4 in
the Big East.

The Lady Panthers have a great deal
to look forward to in the next few years.
They lose only two of their top seven play-
ers, Davis and Hoffman. ,

Davis holds the school record for with
124 wins, which includes both singles and
doubles victories. She broke the record ear-
lierthisyearandkeptaddingtothatnumber
until this weekend

Shalbrack has 85 victories right now
which gives her a chance to tie or break the
record next season. Davis came into this
season with 85
Victories, so. it

the fans. That is what the designers in Pittsburgh
need to focus on — the fans. They are, after all, the
reason the teams make any money in the ﬁrst
place. .

Pittsburgh could go much further than Atlanta
and many other cities. Stadium designers could
incorporate a renaissance of the whole city with
the new stadium. Pittsburgh has the potential for a
Riverwalk, like the one in San Antonio, Texas.

This plan has also been on the drawing board,
but no one seems ready to move on it. The Fifth
Avenue project just unveiled would revamp the
area of downtown and cut oﬁ some streets to make
an outdoor mall or arcade like the one found in
Denver.

The Braves have a balcony area sponsored by
Coca-Cola at Turner Field. This area has more
entertainment and provides a great view of the
playing ﬁeld and the city. There are games and a
chance for a player to win one million dollars for
hitting a home run to this part of the stadium.

The Pirates need to look at this example and
do their best to ﬁnd a way for the fans to enjoy
themselves at a game. This area gives the fans in
the stadium another opportunity for entertainment.

Turner Field also offers aﬂ°ordable tickets and
many luxury boxes. A fan can buy a $10 outﬁeld
seat or a $5 standing room only ticket. The stand-
ing room tickets offer the fan a chance to roam the
stadium and get many different views of the park
and the game.

The stadium also olfers luxury boxes for man-
agement. They sell for $11,0()0 a game, which
adds up to close to $1 million per season for one
box. This means that Braves make money from the
stadium, while the fans can still ﬁnd affordable

‘seats

Many people argue that only players will draw
fans, but the Pirates will never have the money to
pay the players. With a new stadium and the rev-
enue it will produce, the Pirates will be able to
compete in the market of baseball.

Pittsburgh needs to look to Atlanta and other
cities to see what a difference new stadiums have
made for teams and fans. The city can also needs
to jump on for the ride and make great improve-
ments. Our local politicians need to get the ball
rolling and make this city a better place.

Patrick Robertson is the sports editor and would
like to see someone get a roll on building a new
stadium in Pittsburgh.

a third place in the 400-meter.

“The Big East may be the
toughest conference in the nation.
The men ran pretty tough and
many stepped up and ran very
well. We had more points this
year but ﬁnished in the same posi-
tion as last year’s meet,” said
Sobal. ‘

The men brought home a sec-
ond place ﬁnish in the 4x400
relay. The team of Jeremy Ward,
Dilday, Tim Tyre and Carl Taylor
ﬁnished with a time of 3:09.23,
less than three tenths of a second
behind Villanova.

Jack Jeffreys brought another
top 10 ﬁnish to the Panthers with
a seventh place showing in the
men’s high hurdles. t

Finally, the women’s 4x800
relay team ﬁnished fourth with a
time of 8:24.84. The team, Anna
Kohler, Tamika Dorin, Shana
McFadzen and Earl, set a new
school record with that mark.

The men’s and women’s
teams will host the Pitt
Invitational this weekend at Pitt
Stadium.
