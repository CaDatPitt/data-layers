The soul of the black
community is how jack Daniels,

associate provost‘ at Pitt,
‘described black women at the

Zeta'Phi Beta Forum in Finer
Womanhood last night.

Daniels said the leadership of
black women in the community
is strong. “That’s why I worship
them,” he said. Daniels was one
of several recipients of awards
for excellence in the black
struggle.

Addressing the themes of the
forum, “The Success ofthe Black
Woman” and “The Black Male
Crisis,” Dr. Gwendolyn Dillard,
director of counseling services
with the Pitt Engineering Impact
Program, discussed the “menu”

which means “making things
happen instead of waiting or
wondering what will happen.”
Born in the South, Dillard said
she was always faced with the
problem of not being"dark.enough

or white_ enough. She said she

had to ’be proud of her heritage
and had to make her hopes and
dreams a reality by “making a
commitment to excellence.”
Dillard stressed to the audience,
“lie proud of who you are” and
“Know who you are. 'I'hen you'll
know where you are going.”
Kevin Cooper, district justice
of Ilomewood-Brushton and a
Pitt alumnus, thanked Daniels
and Dr. Barbara Sizemore for

Presentation 5/you/5 students bow not to be perfect victim

By Heather Gahres
Staff Writer

A demonstration on how to be the
perfect victim was offered to Pitt’s Greeks
last night.

Citizens Against Crime’s safety consultant
Barbara Gooderham gave the audience
safety tips and easy to perform self-defense
techniques.

Gooderham began by asking the crowd
to point to a victim. “Everybody points to
someone else. Everybody thinks they’ll be
the last victim,” Gooderham said.

She said the two most common places
attacks take place are in the house and the
car. She demonstrated various techniques
for students to protect themselves.

“First, buy the biggest dog dish you can
find. Scruffit up and write a name on it like
‘Killer’. Since the criminal never sees the
dog, they can only assume that it _is in the
house. No criminal is going to go into this
house,” Gooderham said.

She also suggested that people place
security-alarm stickers in the windows of
their homes. “Whether [the protection] is
real or imagined, it will make the criminal
think twice.”

She gave three tips to better protect
people from crimes in their cars. The first
step is to look under your car from about
20 feet away.

The second step is to look in the backseat
of the car. Once inside the car, Gooderham
said to lock the doors.

Gooderham asked, “Do you know how
easy it would be while you’re waiting at a
red light for someone to open the door of
your car and steal your belongings from
your front seat, or worse, for them to get
in your car?”

If a crime situation is unavoidable,
Gooderham suggested techniques to help
students survive the incident. “Ifa criminal
comes by while walking home, drop the
things in your hands. First you have to
lighten your load, because you ’re going to

be running back into the building you just
came from,” she said.

Other tips from Gooderham were to run
toward light and to gain as much distance
as possible. She also told the audience to
scream smart.

“It’s been proven that if you scream
‘Rape!’ or ‘Police!’ people will run the
other way. They don’t want to get involved.
So scream smart. Scream ‘Fire’ -— that will
get people to come. Everybody likes to
see a fire,” Gooderham said. ‘

Gooderham stood behind Heath
Edwards of Phi Sigma Kappa. She asked
the audience for suggestions on how
Edwards should react. Edwards was
instructed to elbow Gooderham. As
Edwards went to elbow Gooderham, she
shot off a gun. “Now you’re dead,” she
said.

“The best thing to do when a criminal
comes from behind you is to stand still and
to ask him as calmly as you can, ‘What do
you want?’ because you have no idea if

Dillard said the menu consists
of dedication and hard work,

and staying off drugs.
“You are the people we turn

they have a weapon or not,” Gooderham
said.
For defense against rape she said, “You

need to have many plans in your mind, .

whether it’s [that] you’re going to faint,
throw up on your assailant, defecate or
say you have AIDS, you’re pregnant or
you’re having your period.”

Gooderham also demonstrated self-
defense techniques. The first was the eye
gouge. ’

“Do the unexpected when a man says
he's going to rape you. Move in closer.
Then take your fingers, rub them through
his hair, place the index fingers above his
ears and stick your thumbs in his eyes.”

The other method she suggested was
called the testicle jerk. “At some point in
the assault, the man will have to expose

himself,” Gooderham said. “At this point ‘_

grab both testicles as hard as you can and
pull down."
Gooderham also said tear gas is the

By Heather Gahres
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Representatives from each Pitt
fraternity and the’Inter-Fraternity
Council executive board will
leave on Thursday for a fourday
president's conference on issues
concerning the Greek system.
Among the major discussions will
be the alcohol policy, rush and
the social policy.

At last night's IFC meeting,
some of the ideas that will be
discussed at the conference were
addressed.

One of the social-policy
changes proposed requires a
member of the executive board
to be present at the door to
oversee guests signing into
parties. The fraternities would
also have 30 seconds to allow
social monitors into their houses,
and the monitors would be
allowed to go upstairs in houses
both on- and off-campus.

Alcohol, social policies
  focus of IFC conference

The rush committee proposed
a change to the rush schedule.
Members asked that rush start
one to two weeks later in the
semester.

David Matta, IFC internal vice
president, said, “I and the other
members of the rush committee
feel that when we first come back
to school there's a lot of stuff
going on. It’s difficult to spend all
of that time when we first get
back worrying about the fraternity
when we also have to worry
about books, classes, add-drop,
making new friends and housing.

“I think pushing rush back will
help the incoming students get to
know the university better and to
know the fraternities on their
own. They will be better able to
pick the right fraternity for them,
and it will give the fraternities a
chance to get to know the guys
better,” Matta said.

Options for ﬁnancial
aid oﬂered oztsemmozr

By Maria Muzzie
Staff Writer

Financial-aid counselor Mark Collins outlined the basic premise
of financial aid in a lecture yesterday sponsored by ‘the Black
Action Society.

Collins said eligibility for financial aid is based on the cost of
college attendance and the amount of family contribution. The
cost of attendance includes fees, tuition, food, books and travel
costs. To determine how much aid a student receives, the cost
of attendanceis subtracted from farnily_ contribution.

“Financial aid is all about satisfying your financial needs,”
Collins said. “The quicker you turn your forms in and the lower
your family contribution, the more grant money you will get.”

In order to get financial aid a student must first ﬁll out a
Financial Aid Form _and a Student Aid Report. In addition
students must submit copies of both their parents’ tax forms
from the previous year as well as their own forms to the Office
of Admissions and Financial Aid in Bruce.,Hall. The deadline for
the FAF form is March 1 for incomingfstudents, April I for
upperclass students and May 1 for transfer students.

Collins said the biggest problem the financial-aid office is
faced with is the financially dependent/independent status of
students. In order to be classified as financially independent,
students must be married, have childrenfbe veterans of war, be

Recession hasn’t stopped alums

 

By George Kopec
Stajf Writer

With the economy slumping
and headlines toting news of the
recession, many college seniors
are” reluctant to enter the job’
market. But those who have
braved the great unknown seem
pleased with the results.

Alumnus Mark Majerac, who
received a bachelor's degree in
communications from Pitt in the
summer of 1990, got his first job
as a marketing representative for
a small-market radio station in
the Pittsburghiarea.

But Majerac said he soon
realized that it wasn't the career
for him.

“I enjoyed it, but I felt limited
because it was such a small
station," he said. Majerac said he
went through a few other jobs
and finally decided to prepare for
a career as an‘_insurance,agent.

Hesaid he. learned the business
through testing and independent
study. Just recently, he was hired
as an agent by Prudential, the
world’s largest financial-services
company. Majerac said he feels
that with such a large company,

there is a lot of room for growth.’

“lt’s nice to have the credibility
that the name Prudential brings,”
he said.

Majerac said a communications
major was a good choice for him
“because there’s a lot of
salesmanship in my job.
Presenting myself and my
business clearly to other people
is the most important thing.
Classes such as Debate helped
because I was forced to do a lot
of speaking in front of people.”

Jeff Smith, who graduated in
1990 with a BA in political science,
said he also feels his degree is
valuable. But he said often the
fact that a person has a college
diploma is more helpful when

looking for employment than
anything that person learned in
classes. Smith’s first job was as an
insurance—fraud investigator for a
Harrisburg firm, Investigative
Consultant Services.

“That job had nothing to do
with political science,” he said.

Smith said his political-science
degree was very useful when he
performed volunteer work for
two recent political campaigns.
He said he believes that “it was
good experience, even though
both guys lost. If one of them had
been elected, he would need a
staff. And my degree would
definitely have helped with that.”

In May 1991, Smith decidedto
return to Pittsburgh to try a
different job market. He stayed
for about two months but was
unable to find a job. Since
returning to Harrisburg, he has
managed to get two part-time
jobs to support himself .while he

license. . . .

Smith said he is optimistic about
the future. “I think the job market
is getting better. There were no
jobs around here for quite a long
time, and my degree is not good
for the business world. But I do
like political science," he said.

Courtney Smyth, also a native
of the Harrisburg area, received
his BA in economics last April.
From July until December he
worked part time at the I-larrisbu rg
Auto Auction while looking for
other opportunities.

“I)uring that time,” he said, “I .

hated running into people who
know I’m a college graduate.
'l'hey’d ask, ‘What are you doing
now?’ and it was embarrassing
because I didn't have a real job.”

In December he was hired as
an estimator for Mark Crete Inc.,
a construction company in
Mechanicsburg, Pa.

a few months and I work long
hours, but I like the job and
there’s a good chance to grow
with them," he said.

Smyth said he thinks an
economics major may not have
been the best choice, but “it’s in
the past. I don’t really regret my
major. With economics there was
a lot of math, which helps for my
job.”

Smyth said he misses the social
life he had at Pitt. "1 have to get

up every morning at 6:45, so now _

I only go out on weekends. But I
wish there was more to do in
Harrisburg. I especially miss
playing basketball at Trees Hall.
That was a lot of fun.”

When asked to give advice to
those entering the job market this
spring, all three said experience
and internships are very important
and the earlier a career is chosen,
the better. _

\I Smyth said he feels that

Majerac said he thinks students
should “try as many different
things as they can early in college
and then decide what is best.”

According to Smith, “The most
valuable thing you can learn in
college is how to live life on your
own. I

Majerac agreed, saying, “In
college you grow socially. I think
that’s at least as important as
writing 10-page research papers.”

BiGALA opposes ROTC
retention: on Pitt campus

Byjohn Temple
Sta17' Writer

The Bisexual, Gay and lesbian Alliance met to discuss ways
to let Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor know it opposes his
decision to retain Pitt’s ROTC program despite the U.S.
Department of Defense's discriminatory policy toward bisexuals,
gays and lesbians.

“Our goal is to change the DOD policy, not to get ROTC off-
campus,” said BiGALA co-President Linda Jarrett. “But trying to
remove ROTC is a way to get the policy changed.”

Last night’s meeting encouraged people to form petitions and
write to President Bush, urging him to oppose the DoD’s policy.-

In May 1991, the University Senate Cou ncil’s ROTC Ad Hoc

Committee concluded that the university was violating its own
anti-discriminatory policy and recommended that the ROTC be
phased out if the DoD did not change its policy by 1997. The
DoD policy maintains that homosexuality is incompatible with
military service and thus allows no known homosexuals in the
ROTC.

Pitt President]. Dennis O’Connor said last week that he will
push the DOD to change its policy by joining with other
universities, but he willnot adopt the l1‘)‘)7.deadline for policy

‘O’Connor said’ that‘ if\Pitt‘ acts apart‘ from the American
Association of Universities by dropping ROTC, it will “harm a

segment of our community that has benefitted from the ROTC. 

In acting alone, we are unlikely to bring about what we really
desire, which is the end of the discriminatory policy.” '

The BiGALA policy statement on ROTC discrimination,
released yesterday, refuses to accept this as a means of action.
It states, “It is unlikely that these steps alone will cause the DoD
to change.” 

Jarrett said she recently learned that the AAU, in conjunction
with three other higher education institutions, have already
been pressuring the DoD in the way that O’Connor’ suggests,
but they have had little effect. _ 

“Being that O’Connor is new, we’re willing to wait for six

months or so to see what happens [with the AAUI,” Jarrett said.

,‘‘But we,really“_need_t,o change our tactics in Iherwayiother

colleges and universities across thenation are? ..  ..

Jarrett suggested targeting Bush instead of Congress and the
military, since the president, as commander in chief, is

judge oﬂers aid to Upward Bound

By Tonya Hurley
For T be Put News

When you walk in the office of
judge Cynthia Baldwin, you might
have difficulty spotting her. She
is almost buried behind an
enormous desk that is cluttered
with papers, folders and a big,
neon—orange plastic gavel. She
picks up the gavel and says in a
professional tone, “’l'hat’s my
gavel for when the attorneys act
silly."

Baldwin has been on the bench
for two years, earned her
undergraduate and master's
degrees at Penn State and then
went on to Duquesne Law School.
“I am a glutton for punishment,"
she said.

Baldwin said she has realized it
takes a lot of effort and tolerance

to be an achiever.

She recalled one such situation
that occurred when she was
working as a lawyer. She and her
investigator were sitting outside
the courtroom, and the lawyer on
the other side came over to discuss
the case.

The lawyer sat down next to
the investigator, who was a white
male, and begun discussing the
case.

He did not acknowledge
Baldwin’s presence. When he was
finished, the lawyer asked the
investigator if they could settle
the case.

“The investigator looked at me
and said, ‘I wouldn’t know, she’s
the lawyer.’ This is what ablack
female might face being a lawyer,”
she said.

Baldwin is an active member in

the Upward Bound program,
which helps minorities and
disadvantaged students maintain
high standards in their high school
work and encourages them to go
to college.

When Baldwin is not working
or giving motivational speeches,
“in those two minutes I call my
own," she said with a laugh, she
likes to travel or fish. She has
visited the Soviet Union, Japan,
Europe and Alaska, where she
caught a 22-pound bass.

Baldwin said she enjoys
spending time with her family
the more than anything else.

Her husband is a chemical
engineer; her son is in his second
year of law school at Georgetown,
and her daughter is in her second
year of pre—med at Penn
State.

Economics prof Rawski
has no regrets about Pitt

By Su-Anna Bareford
For The Pitt News

People might question economics Professor Thomas Rawski’s
decision to leave a secure post at the University of Toronto in
order to accept a job as an economics professor here at Pitt. But
Rawski said he has no regrets.

“My move to Pittsburgh has proved very successful,” he said.

Born and raised in Ithaca, N.Y., Rawski has an ivy-league
education with degrees from both Cornell and Harvard
universities.

After completing his graduate work, Rawski went on to teach
in Toronto for 14 years before coming to Pittsburgh.

Rawski said his love of economics dates back to early in his
childhood.

“I recall reading Adam Smith as a boy. My mother used to tell
me about times that I refused to go to school; I claimed that it
interfered with my reading. Many stomach aches were concocted,
believe me," he said. _

When asked if he thought the current recession may lead to
a depression similar to the one America suffered in the 19303,
Rawski said, “I think that the two situations are completely
different.

“Not only are the circumstances much less severe, but consider
the difference in institutions. Back then there was no welfare, no
job security, no minimum-wage installation. There were no
safety nets,” he said.

Rawski said the recession has become magnified by the fact
that 1992 is a presidential election year.

“It’s clear that our economic status is an important factor in the
elections. The political consequences are more important than
the recessionitself. Though it is not severe, the fact that it is an
election year magnifies it,” he said.

Aside from American economics, Rawski also specializes in
Asian economics, particularly Chinese and Japanese.

Recently, the Japanese prime minister was quoted as saying
American workers perform slovenly on Mondays and Fridays.
Rawski said he was skeptical about the actual remarks, but not
the point.

Pitt prof receives NEA fellowship

By Bruce Boul
Staff Wﬁter

Pitt English Professor Lynn Emanuel has
recently been recognized by the National
Endowment for the Arts for her talent and
creativity.

Emanuel was awarded an N EA Fellowship of
$20,000 for The Dig, an award-winning book of
poetry which will be available in March.

According to Emanuel, the book is centered
on the female and based on her place in a certain
culture, particularly the state of Nevada.

“The theme is isolation,” Emanuel said. “The
woman in the book has artistic yearnings, but
she’s trapped in the emptiness of Nevada.”

Emanuel said the book isn’t overtly political,
but it simply deals with a contradictory woman
walking the margin of a large culture.

“It’s the least autobiographical book l’ve
written,” Emanuel said. “This woman is not a
relative, or me, but I saw her ltypel very frequently
while I was in Nevada.”

The NEA fellowship allows writers the
opportunity to advance their careers through
writing, research or travel.

Emanuel has also been a member of the
literature panel for the National Endowment of
the Arts and the Pennsylvania Council on the
Arts.

Other fellowships Emanuel has won include
those offered by The Virginia Center for the
Creative Arts and Yaddo, which is a writer
colony focused on writing workshops and giving
readings.

Her first book, Hotel Fiesta, published in 1984,
won her the Great Lakes Colleges Association’s
New Writers’ Award.

“This was more of a family-oriented book,”
she said, “dealing with my father’s family living
in Eastern Europe.” She said the book centers on
how they were haunted by the history of that
region, particularly the second World War.

Emanuel’s work has also been published in
Poetry, The Hudson Review, The Kenyon Review,
Triguarterly, and Ploughshares.

Cooper said it is important to

active participation in uplifting
the black community in times of
struggle, went to Gail Autin,
assistant director of enrollment

said.

They had a conversation about
the Carnegie, and Regoli
complained that Pitt is a terrible
institution. St. Clair disagreed with
him and gave him his definition
of why Pitt is a good institution,
according to St. Clair.

“During this conversation he
proceeded to tell me he was
banned from the Carnegie —
he’s been kicked out several times
— and also that he was banned
from University of Pittsburgh
buildings. We continued to talk
for a while, and he proceeded to
tell me what Andrew Carnegie
thinks now.

He said Andrew Carnegie
would not want students to buy
passes,” St. Clair said.

At this point St. Clair said he
began to worry because he did

According to the campus-police
report, the police found Regoli in
the main lobby and asked him to
step outside and talk. Regoli
allegedly pushed the of licer aside
and became loud and disorderly.
He was placed against a wall,
where he continued to resist
arrest.

He was then taken to the station
and charged with defiant
trespassing and resisting arrest.
He had been previously warned

St. Clair! He’ll help me!”’ St. Clair
said. “This guy is looking to me as
a guardian or a friend, andl want
nothing to do with him, nor do I
see him as a friend.”

Regoli has a record with the
campus police dating back to the

early 1980s, but he is “not ‘

dangerous.

His record does not involve
any type of assaults. It involves
mostly trespassing,” Gary Moses,
assistant director of the
Department ofPublic Safety said.

“When he was put in jail, his
friend called me and wanted to
let me know that Regoli was in
jail and asked if I wanted to go
down to his arraignment,” St.
Clair said.

St. Clair described Regoli as
“|6—feet, 5-inches talll with a dirty

Students on tight budgets may think
they can't afford to travel abroad, but
others have found creative and unusual
ways to pay the bills.

Two years ago Eric Winger drove in a
convoy of missionary trucks through the
Baltic States and into the Ukraine, delivering
food, clothing and Bibles to the needy of
the villages they stopped in.

“We also held evangelical meetings [at
the villagesl," Winger said. “It was with the
focus of caring for people's physical needs
but also addressing the issue of their
spiritual needs."

Winger, a Pitt senior, spoke in a quiet
voice about sleeping in the trucks during
the cold nights to guard the materials they
were hauling. But often when the convoy
stopped, they would spend time with the
townspeople, he said.

“They were all really loving people who

A would open their homes at inhuman

hours,” Winger said. ‘‘I almost got fed
better in Eastern Europe, ironically, than /A
in Germany. ’l'o me, that was really
impressive.”

Winger’s involvement in this project
began when he looked‘ into social-work
organizations while he was studying at
Bonn University in Germany last year. ‘‘I
had no idea I would do what I did before
I went to Germany,” he said.

But now Winger said he is planning to
return to work for at least a year with the
same group at youth prison work-camps.

According,t,o Megan lleard, working is
not only the,most effective way to cut the
expenses offoreign travel, it is also a great
way to get in contact with the culture of a

Going to Europe as an au pair is one of the best ways
to go, if you want to learn about the culture.

-Alexandra Baskin

country. Heard, a Pittsenior, “got in contact”
with the culture of Great Britain, along
with its ancient superstitions, while selling
aerial photos in the towns and cities of
northeast England last summer.

Unfortunately, the day she rolled into
one small village, a fishing company had
discarded its waste nearby, attracting into
town swarms of ﬂies which thickly covered
her shirt.

“’I'he first two stops I went to, the people
were nice and I made sales," Heard said.
“But after a while, people began to get
nasty, and then they would see me coming
and bar their doors and wouldn’t speak to
me. it was really weird.”

l.ater in the day she met an out-of-
towner who explained to her that the
villagers believed that she was a witch
who had brought the flies to town with
her.

Well-paying jobs overseas, such as
lle'ard’s, are few and far between. Heard
said that “getting the job was a matter of
being in the right place at the right time.”
She was studying at the University of
Sheffield when she had a chance to apply
for the job.

One reason why such jobs are difficult
to get is that most European companies»
require that their applicants have special
work visas before they will hire, but visa

applicants must show that someone has_

hired them before they can get one.
One way to get around this dilemma is

to work (usually just for room and board)
as a volunteer. The March/April issue of
Archaeology magazine carries a guide to
European archaeological digs, most of
which are looking for volunteers, not
necessarily experienced, each year.
Another method is to work as an au pair,
living with a European family while caring
for their children. Alexandra Baskin, a Pitt
sophomore, lived with a Parisian family
two years ago and took care of three
young children.

“Going to Europe as an au pair is one of
the best ways to go, if you want to learn
about the culture,” Baskin said. “Because
you are living with people who are natives
to the city, it is better than going as a
student.”

Young Americans are in vogue as au
pairs for European families, according to
The Washington Post. This ' is because
Europeans want their children to learn
English and are simply drawn by America’s
allure, said Linda Greenberg, program
manager for the Au Pair/Homestay Abroad
Program. ,

The program costs $1,200 to $1,400, but
the au pair earns a $250 monthly stipend.-

“The longer you stay, the more profitable‘

it is because the.program:costs.the same‘. ..

All the students agreed that contacts are
extremely important assets when going
overseas. Mark Weixel got a job looking
after children at a summer camp near the
Spanish border in France through his
godfather’s brother.

Weixel said that acquaintances are often
willing to bend foreign work regulations.
“T hat’s the way you do it,” he said.

Through this experience, Weixel
developed a network of friends, whom he
was able to visit when he went back the
next summer.

Mark Seaman, a Study Abroad Office
intern, said the first rule of easy travel is:
“Travel light.”

“Every time I traveled, I took less and
less until I finally got it down to a science,”
he said. Seaman also recommends
obtaining an international student ID and
Eurail passes.

And if someone is planning to go»

overseas on a work program, such as the
Council on International Educational
Exchange, Seaman said they should start
preparing early. ,

‘‘If you have a deadline in March and
you start looking into it in January, then
you’ll see a program that looks enticing
and go and realize that it wasn’t what you
were looking for,” he said. “But if you start
looking a year in advance, then you will
find exactly what you want.”

But Heard stressed a more inward type

“:You have to be ready to open. yourself

The BiGALA policy statement also notes “increased anti-queer

and every refusal involves the
subject of spending habits,” Kacey
Gribbin, a senior who works in
the Development and Alumni
Affairs Office, said.

Due to the cutbacks in state
funding, alumni donations are
more important than ever. The
cutbacks combined with the drop
in alumni donations could cause
an increase in tuition for students,
according to Gribbin.

Alumni donations pay 1/3 of
the cost for a student to attend
Pitt. Another third comes from
the student’s tuition. The final
third comes from state funding,
Gribbin said.

“I call, and if it’s someone who
had given last year or recently,
I'll ask if they want to contribute
again. A lot say, ‘First there was
Posvar, and now there’s
O’Connor.’ — I get that one a
lot,” Gribbin said.

Gribbin, who has been working
with development and alumni
affairs for five weeks, said that

It was also announced at the
meeting that John Demming of
Sigma Chi will be Pitt’s nominee
for the North Eastern IFC Greek
Man ofthe Year award. Demming
was last year’s IFC external-vice
president.

and each of them hears
O’Connor’s installation as the
reason for not giving at least

once a day.
However Mark Cromie, the
executive director of

development, disagrees with
Gribbin’s claims. “The comment
that Pitt is taking a major hit on its
giving is simply incorrect,” he
said.

The annual giving fund is
running at virtually the same level
it did last year.

It is running at a 2—percent
decline from last year at this
time, according to Cromie.

Because millions of dollars are
involved in fund raising, 2 percent
is miniscule. Between July 1990
andjanuary 1991, $3,649,000 had
been raised through fund raising.
By the end of this January,
$3,600,000 had been raised,
Cromie said.

In December the alumni
associau'on’s executive committee
voluntarily contributed $10,000
to help sponsor the Friday
evening installation event.

Last week “a grass—roots effort
was started which so far has
obtained $20,000 in pledges from

alumni,” Lee Patouillet, director '

of development and alumni
affairs, said.

Many checks from alumni who
strongly support the installation
have been received by the office
of alumni affairs, according to
Patouillet.

Cromie said the office does
periodically receive complaints,
concerns and recommendations
from alumni, but these come in a
variety of forms. Either by
telemarketing calls, by mail or by
person to person, alumni express
their concerns.

“’l'hese issues have sparked a __

wide range ofopinions,” Cromie
said.

In response to the claim Gribbin
made, Cromie said, ‘‘It doesn’t
hold water.” Many of the alumni
“feel the installation is a vital part
of the fabric of the university’s
past and future, that it's a
worthwhile undertaking,” Cromie
said.

University of Pennsylvania

Penn graduatejonathan Gersch
said he knew something was
awry when he found a note from
his roommate thanking him for
taking his physics final the
previous term.

Gersch said he was only kidding
when he agreed to take
Schuldiner’s exam in his place.
When Schuldiner returned after
last year's Christmas break, he
was enraged when he discovered
that Gersch had “betrayed” him
and promised that “revenge will
be sweet."

The vengeance that Schuldiner

wreaked on Gersch, which ~

included numerous incidents of
vandalism and a forged, hateful
letter written in Gersch’s name to
one of his friends, prompted Penn
officials to evict him from his
university—owned residence.
Schuldiner, in turn, sued the
university for breaking his
housing agreement and for
causing him “mental, physical

On Monday, Feb. 10, the verdict read: “Tyson Guilty.”
Heavyweightboxing champion Mike Tyson was found
guilty in another highly publicized attack on a woman.
Deliberating for nine hours, the jury reached its decision
on all three counts of sexual assault. Tyson could receive
up to 60 years in prison; however, most likely, Tyson will
only face five to 10 years for the egregious assault.

Anne Seymour of the National Victim Center said that
she was pleased. Women who have been assaulted,
harassed, beaten and intimidated can triumph.

While the jury was resistant to claims that rape victims
are to blame for every act of violence committed upon the
female, our culture still partially blames women.

Rape is violence. More often than not it is directed
against women. Tyson's rape trial indicates women not
only need to fear individual rapists, but also, women must
fear a society on the whole that condones rnisogynistic
violence.

At the center of the post-Tyson debacle, two incidents
come to mind.

First, the inhuman comments from the king of civility,
Donald Trump. Trump, the mogul making bucks off his
gladiators, issued an offensive argument. He claimed that
Tyson should not serve jail time. Instead, Trump said
Tyson should be allowed to go free, beat other men in the
boxing ring and donate the money to some worthy cause.

’Frump’s argument can be summed up in a few words.
If you have a buck, you can buy your way out of any mess.
Trump's vision of justice puts poor rapists in jail, but the
rich ones go free.

Maybe Trump wouldexpect the public to exempt him
from attempted murder’ with a handgun if he could make
a sizable donation to the Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, Inc.

The second slap in the collective face of rape survivors
comes from a different sort of people. Presently, groups
of individuals are circulating petitions for Tyson's release.
Some religious clergy are asking the judge to show mercy
on Mike Tyson. Ills troubled formative years must be
taken into consideration, they argue. '

Sympathy for individuals in the criminal justice system,
while commendable, is not evenly applied. Jeffrey Dahmer
has not caught the heart of America. Convicted of rape,
Willie Horton became a pawn in the 1988 presidential
race; he was a weapon against Michael Dukakis’ bid for
the presidency.

Now Tyson, the vehicle for money-hungry promoters,
cable networks, entrepreneurs and corporate executives,
must be saved. llis earning potential supposedly exempts
him from the criminal justice system.

We disagree.

Not only does Tyson symbolize a fast profit, he also
represents male domination over women. Voices must be
raised against harassment, rape and the abuse of women.
Women must fight back.

ROTC decision disregards Pitt’s standards

The University of Pittsburgh states that it “does
not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ethnicity,
national origin, age, sex, sex orientation or marital,
veteran or handicapped status.” When President 1.
Dennis O’Connor decided to reject the University
Senate's recommendation to phase out the ROTC
on campus, he blatantly violated

appeared in Tuesday’s issue of The Pitt News.
“Demanding the removal of Pitt’s ROTC” is only
going to hurt students, more so than theieffect it
would have on the DoD.

Some people think it’s wonderful‘ that Harvard
and Yale have kicked their ROTC programs off-
campus, but guess what? They're

this policy.

Letters

private institutions. Pitt is still
partially state-funded and knows
enough to not bite the hand that

from the military. Allowing this

practice to continue at Pitt is an abuse of not only
university guidelines but also of our national
Constitution. '

The 14th Amendment states that no law should
be enforced “which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United States.”

Supporting ROTC means an endorsement of policies

contrary to our country’s basic principles.
Lieutenant Colonel Michael Cassetori recently
asked “Why should Pitt students  be penalized for
a policy over which they have no control?” Well,
J.D. O’Connor does have control. He has the
responsibility to uphold university standards as
well as the standards our nation was built upon.

Ignore anti-gay, racial harassment

I feel that the special—interest groups on campus
are doing entirely too much whining and moaning.
If all of these people want equality, why do they
insist on being so visible? I'd expect “equality" to
mean everyone living together with no one person
receiving better treatment than the next guy. For
example, the homosexual population — “We’re
here. We’re queer. Get used to it!” Tell you what,
guys and gals, I’m used to it. So stop telling me!

As far as “hate speech" goes, ignore it! Unless
someone is being violent, ignore them. Eventually
they’ll get bored. Let us not forget our “sticks and
stones.” I live with numerous smart—ass remarks on
my appearance everyday, but I’m not going to
change for them. I won't even think of it. This silly
“politically correctness” is part of the reason that
television and much literature are so meaningless
today. Everyone is so afraid of offending someone
 Please, people, try to offend me. Things could
get a lot more interesting. If you're offended so
easily, you're not as open-minded as you cry out to
be. Say what you mean, and say it mean!

Steve Abate
CA5 '94
Bias against everyone

I’m writing in response to the two letters that

feeds them.

What’s more, ROTC is voluntary, 'meaning that

people aren’t forced to join. All clubs, groups or
contests have certain criteria that their members
must meet to join.

Phi Beta Kappa applicants, for example, must’

have a 3.5 cumulative GPA. Why don’t we hear
students with a 1.3 or a 3.3 screaming discrimination?
Why aren’t the white women of the U.S. screaming

discrimination because they ”can’t participate, in the‘

Miss Black America Pageant’

Obviously, it would be ridiculous. Likewise with
ROTC, whose criteria who are set forth by the DoD.
If the candidates don’t meet the criteria, then they’ll
be denied-access.

Why, Mark Carlin, when a conservative (Fisher)
finally defends something worth defending, does
the issue become “insignificant?”

Parent speaks out against discrimination

As a father of two beautiful and wonderful
children, I am deeply concerned about children
and young adults. Recently, I have read President
O’Connor will allow ROTC to continue to operate
at the university. This is despite the fact ROTC by
the mandate of the Department of Defense
discriminates, isolates and persecutes soldiers they
discover are gay or bisexual. The thought of young
gay, lesbian or bisexual students in the ROTC being
discovered is frightening. The military shows no
compassion. When discovered, gay military
personnel are hunted.

Pitt refuses to take a strong position on the issue.
While supporting non-discrimination, O’Connor is
content that students will be hurt if they interact
with ROTC. Just putting a warning statement on
brochures sou nds like “separate by equal” thinking.
Few people beneﬁt from ROTC's presence on
campus. Many more people suffer. Asking ROTC to
leave by a certain‘date in the future gives the
university power in its relationship to the Department
of Defense. O’Connor’s solution only shows his

' lack of u nderstanding and disregard for gay people.

The Pitt Hockey Club
finished off a tough
weekend schedule with an

the Saints of Penn State
University at McKeesport.

The Panthers started the
weekend on a sour note
when they were upset 5-4
by the Tartans of Carnegie
Mellon .Friday night. The
following day, however, the
Panthers vindicated
themselves by skinning the
Gators of Allegheny
College, 7-3.

goal, and they were
determined not to
relinquish the game to the
Saints. The Pitt squad held
the Saints scoreless for the
remainder of the period,
yet Pitt still managed to net
an additional goal at the
12:42 mark, when Matt
White netted his first goal
of the season off passes by
Bill Crousey and Deron

The second period
opened with the Panthers
netting two consecutive
goals 34 seconds apart. Pitt’s
third goal was dumped in
by Kip Linse at the 4:15
mark off a drop-back pass
from Ken Anderson.

Emulating their
teammates, Stock shot the

Crousey at the 4:49 mark.

The Saints proved they

when left wing Bob Reed

5:53 mark. Following close
behind his teammate’s lead,
center Steve Vinay netted

The phrase “Swim team

for the Pitt women’s swimming
and diving team this season. While
injuries and the departures of
swimmers have been the focal
point of the 1991-92 swim saga,
perhaps the best story of the year
has been the performance of Pitt’s
women divers. _ .

Heading into this weekend’s

and Donna Ziegler have been a

have performed like veterans.

The annual Pitt Men's Tennis

day tournament, visiting players

» — from Penn State in particular

— stole the spotlight from the
host team.

In the singles competition, the
stronger and swifter players from
Penn State, Buffalo University,
Akron University and Mercyhurst
College took center stage. They
did not allow a single Pitt athlete
to advance past the quarterfinals
in any of the three brackets.

The Pitt Invitational posts no
team totals, as it is a purely
individual tournament organized
in a round—robin fashion with
three singles brackets and two
doubles brackets. This is the
second year that the Invitational
has been in existence.

Head coach George

tournament as an improvement
over Pitt’s performance in last
year’s Invitational.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February 19, 1992

 

By Rob Mazur

Sports Editor

While the Pitt Lady Panthers
may have experienced an up-
and-down conference season this
year, it could be worse. They
could be the Boston College
Eagles, losers of nine conference
games in a row. I

When the two teams played
Jan. 18, Boston College came in
riding two consecutive conference
wins. After Boston College
controlled a low-scoring first half,
leading 30-22 at the break, the
Lady Panthers came back to take
control of the game, scoring 43
points inthe second half en route
to a 65-62 victory.

That was the start of the Eagles’
current slide, which they have
not been able to break. In that
period, they have lost four of the
nine games by 10 points or more.
They came close to snapping the
streak at six games when they lost
a 74-73 contest to the St. John's
Express.

Tonight, the Lady Panthers and
the Eagles face each other for
what will probably be the last
time this season on a game
televised by KBI. cable network.
Pitt cannot take this game too
lightly because it has not faired
much better since it defeated the
Eagles. Since the Boston College
game, the Lady Panthers have
won two out of their last eight

contests. However they have

started to display an intensity
level that head coach Kirk Bruce
said he hoped would have come
much sooner in the year.
“Before the start of the Miami
game, we all promised each other
that we would play as hard as we
could every second we were on
the court,” Bruce said. “We-were
in that game for a while. They’re

for the rest of the season,” Bruce
said. I

The Eagles may be in for a
surprise because not only is Pitt
playing with a different attitude,
but also a slightly differentlineup.
When the two teams faced off in
Boston, Julie Fornadel and Carol
Morton were in the starting lineup.

Fornadel has started in four
games in place of Carolyn Miller.
However Miller still saw 21
minutes against the Eagles. The
bigger of the two changes was
the replacement of Morton with
Jill McElhinny in what Bruce calls
a “more offensive-minded
Iineup.”

McElhinny started earlier in the
year but was replaced by Morton
when her ball-handling became
lackadaisical. While Morton
provides speed and quickness at
the point, she has yet to develop
a consistent shot and has broken
double figures in scoring only
once this season. .

came back into the hunt and
blazed the puck into the Saints’
goal — unassisted —— at the 7:57
mark.

Less than a minute later the
Panthers hooked an interference
call that sent Phil Laux into the
penalty box. Although short-
handed, the Panthers used it as a
scoring opportunity. The Saints
had the man advantage, but the
Panthers had a better skating
advantage. At the 9:15 mark Pitt
capitalized on its skating ability
and netted its sixth goal of the
competition.

Putting the puck into the net
for his 32nd goal of the season
was Crousey, off an assist from
Ed Giordano.

The Pitt squad decided that it
was not going to sit down in this
game, and it proved that point
once again when it netted its
seventh goal at the 11:09 mark.
Moments later, the Panthers
snagged a hooking call that gave
the Saints another good scoring

Opportunity. .

This time the Saints managed
to get past Pitt goaltender Dan
Bratkovich and put the puck in
the net. Reed set up in front of the
Panthers’ net. Trailman Vinay
came in from Bratkovich’s stick
side to score the Saints’ third
goal.

The Panthers came back onto
the ice during the third period
and set fire to it. The Saints, on
the other hand, decided to come
out during the third and stop the
Panthers from widening the
scoring gap.

In return for their efforts, the
Saints received a roughing and a
tripping call roughly a minute
apart from each other. The Saints
handed" the Panthers three
minutes worth of power-play
time.

The Panthers quickly pounced
on the gift, and Giordano skated
in Pitt’s eighth goal at the 5:50
mark off a pass from Brent Spitzer.

However trouble began for the
Panthers five seconds after

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February 19, 1992

By Bill Karahalios
For The Pitt News

One runs the long races, while
the other is a sprint and hurdle
specialist. ButJim Hamilton and
Brett Shields are alike; they are
both looked upon for leadership
by a young Pitt team.

Hamilton, a fifth-year senior,
is from Imperia, Pa., in Finley
Township, just 25 minutes from
Pittsburgh. He is the youngest of
four children, and his older
brother, Harry Hamilton, won
the WPIAL golf championship
in 1969. Just 18 years later Jim
won the WPIAL championship
in cross—country.

“I think that's pretty wild how
we both won championships in
different sports,” Jim Hamilton
said.

He received scholarship offers
from South Alabama, Bucknell
and Pitt. According to Hamilton,
being close to home was one of
the reasons he chose Pitt. He
majors in chemistry and is
student-teaching at Taylor
Allderdice High School. “Pitt had
a pretty good science
department, which is another
reason I came to Pitt,” Hamilton
said. He said his goal is to teach
and coach track after this year.

Assistant track coachJim Lear,
who recruited Hamilton, said he
doesn’t let him slide.

“lLear is] real understanding,
but yet strict,”, Hamilton said.

Hamilton has come along way
since his first year. “I was short
and heavy but kept on working

S/yields, Hamilton leaders for trade

harder,” he said, “and not being
able to deal with pressure was
my major problem.” ,

Most of the credit for his hard
work and leadership on the
team goes to head coach John
Vasvary, who helped build up
his confidence. Hamilton runs
in the morning, then student-
teaches and goes off to track
practice for a busy day.

He is an IC4A qualiﬁer in the
one-mile run and the 3,000
meter but has his sites set on
the 5,000 meter in the Big East
Championship in Syracuse this
weekend. “This is the first time
I will run the 5,000 this year,”
Hamilton said. His best time in
the event is 14:52. He added,
“We need a lot of leadership
from the seniors. If you know
how to handle the pressure, it’s
like any other meet."

Brett Shields, another track
senior, is from Harrisburg, Pa.,
and is majoring in legal studies.
Other than Pitt, Shields also
received scholarship offers from
North Carolina State, the
University of North Carolina and
the University of Colorado.
Shields said he found Pitt’s track
team more appealing.

“I saw a good hurdling
tradition that sparked my
interest,” he said.

Shields said he plans on
entering Pitt’s School of
Education and pursuing a law
degree someday. But right now
Shields seems to have some
similarities with Hamilton, as
he wants to teach and coach

track at the high-school level.
Shields has started by coaching
younger kids in track during
the summer back home.

Shields said he has always
looked up to his parents.

“They are the greatest, most
supportive, and they taught
me the values of life,” he said.

According to Shields, his role
model was Leroy Gallaway,
his track coach at Milton
Hershey High School in
Hershey, Pa. “He helped
develop my track skills,”
Shields said. “I think a lot of
kids don’t have any role models
to help them along.”

Pitt head coach Steve Lewis
seems to have had the most
effect on him in college, since
Lewis is the sprint and hurdle
coach for the men. “Coach
Lewis had a good effect on
me, but all the coaches helped
me grow — especially
academically,” Shields said.

Shields will be competing in
four different events this
weekend at the Big East
Championships. The 55-meter
hurdles, in which he already
has an NCAA provisional
qualifying’ time; the SS-meter
dash, a fairly new event for
him; the 200-meter dash and
the 4x400 relay. “I need to do
well to go to the NCAA
Championships because I
already have good qualifying
times,” he said. “A lot of people
are looking for me to do well,
and I'm looking to run some
better times al_s’o(._”H

played very well. The injuries to
our players held us back.”

The Panther team was plagued

with irritating injuries that affected

individual play. Agonizing ankle
injuries to first-year Panther Scott
Smith and senior Joel Orth were
reﬂected in their play. Senior Larry
Garrard had a tightness in his
upper leg that affected his
performance in the tournament.

In Flight A Singles action, senior
Eric Weaver advanced to the
quarters, by virtue of a bye, only
to lose in straight sets (6-1, 6-4) to

John Lavere of Buffalo U. Pitt’s

only other Flight A participant
was senior John Tegano, who
was beaten in the preliminaries.

Flight B Singles had basically
the same recipe: Two Panthers
were thrown into the mix, neither
of whom advanced past the
quarterfinals.

Pitt’s best performance in
singles was turned in by junior
Alex Cobbald, who dominated
his preliminary match against
Mercyhurst’s Jamie Pilkington.
Cobbald’s straight—set victory I7-
6, 6-3] boosted him into the
quarterfinal round, where he
pushed Penn State’s Brett
Englesburg to the wall before
losing in three sets, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2.

In Flight A Doubles
competition, the team of Garrard
and Orth advanced to the
semifinal round via a bye, then
fell to a powerhouse team from
Penn State, which went on to win
the Flight A final match.

In last year’s competition, Pitt

had its best showing in Flight B
Doubles action, and that tradition
continued this year.

In Flight B, the team of Cobbald
andJames Chronister tore through
the opening two rounds with a
straight—set [6-4, 6-0] thrashing of
a team from Buffalo University
and a three-set I6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4)]
victory over a Mercyhurst combo.
Cobbald and Chronister were
flying high when they entered

Colabrese struggling to put the
ball in the hoop over a stretch of
four games, Bruce made the
switch. Since then, the Lady
Panthers have gone 2-2, defeating
Syracuse and Seton Hall but losing
to Miami and Villanova.

“Our offense has finally come
back to us,” Bruce said. “We
struggled there for a while. We
were playing good defense, but
we couldn’t score."

Offense will be a key for the
Lady Panthers if they expect to
leave Fitzgerald Field House with
a victory tonight. Boston College
brings with it a potent backcourt
attack which features Sarah Behn
and Kelly Curran.Behn, a junior
who started all 23 games last
season, currently ranks at the top
of the scoring list against Big East
opponents. She averages 26.1
points a game versus conference
foes and 26.5 in all games, second
behind Providence’s Tracy Lis.
Behn has also grabbed 8.4 boards
per contest and ranks among the
leaders in free-throw percentage.

Curran, a sophomore point
guard, ranks sixth on the scoring
list for conference games, just
behind Pitt’s Jonna Huemrich.
She currently averages 17.3 per
Big East contest and 16.9 for all

games, good for fifth place. Curran
also ranks third on the assist list
with 5.4 a game.

Bruce said he realizes that these
two players pose a huge threat to

his team but does not feel that a .

drastic defensive adjustment will
be necessary.

“We have the players that can
effectively limit Behn from the
floor, but if you try and do that
she hurts you in other ways,”
Bruce said. “If you try to stop her,
she makes everyone else on the
team better. When you don’t let
her score, she turns into a great
passer. We just have to play
aggressive, tough defense on the
entire team."

One problem Pitt has had this
season is falling too far behind to
come back. Excluding Saturday's
win against Seton Hall, Pitt has
come from behind in all of its Big
East wins. Against BC, the Lady
Panthers fell behind early, scoring
only 22 points in the entire first
half. They came back and scored
42 in the second half.

“We seem to get real serious in
the second half,” Bruce said. “We
need to jump on people right
away at home and try and take
advantage of that. If we can put

two halves together, I think we

have a real good chance.”

a shoulder injury.

While her contributions have
been missed, the void created by
her injury has been aptly filled by
the improved diving of Rose and
Ziegler.

Rose, in particular, has come
on strong in the past month. She
placed second in both the 1- and
3-meter events against Ohio at

g the team’s last meet.

Of her first-year
accomplishments, Rose is most
proud of attaining two goals that
she set for herself this year. One
was making NCAA prequals
(along with Rose and Flatch). She
achieved perhaps a sweeter
“personal” goal against Penn State,
when she beat her high-school
nemesis, Tara Stevens.

at high-school states, and I always
wanted to beat her,” Rose said.

State, I beat her.”

Ziegler, younger sister of former
Pitt swimmer Teri Ziegler, is a
walk-on athlete who Krug said
has shown steady improvement
all year.

Pitt will need yet another strong
performance from its divers ifit is
to have any chance of repeating
as conference champions for a
10th straight year.

A big reason for uncertainty
about Pitt’s chances is the
presence of the Miami of Florida
team as ﬁrst—time participants in
the league meet. In addition to
fielding a solid swim squad, the
Hurricanes boast perhaps the best
trio of women divers of any team
in the country.

Miami seniors Beth Wadlington,
Betsy Girvin and Robbi Dalton
were All-Americans last year, and
they have all scored at nationals.

Senior captain Phil Cruz agreed.
‘fl think it is going to be an
extremely exciting meet," he said.

to the team. It’s a good thing
because it will help the divers

performance.”

says that Pitt could only
conceivably approach its southern
opponent if Pitt has “a really
good day and they have a bad
day.”

The women’s diving
competition for this year’s Big
East Championship at Trees Pool
is distinctly split between three
segments of the entrants,
according to Krug.

“It’s really Miami [of Florida) at
the top, Pitt at the next level, then
the rest of the field," Krug said.
“'I'hey’re not untouchable, but
Miami is definitely the class of the
field.” '

While Pitt divers said the Miami
team is the prohibitive favorite,
they aren’t in awe of the ‘Canes.
Flatch put it best: Miami hasn’t
won anything yet, and the
pressure is directly on them.

“They have to put on a suit and
get out there and do 10 and 11
dives,” Flatch said, “just like
everyone else.”

little sharper,” diver Mike Naylor
said. “Miami is like at the
professional level, and I get in a
certain kind of mode [against
that kind of competition]. It’s a
mental thing.

“At this point in the season,
you should just be  [Naylor
snapped his fingers]. Everything
is going to go well from now on.”

Not only must Pitt raise the
level of its performance and
concentration to dive well, but it
must not be intimidated by‘ the
tradition and talent of one of the
country’s best diving teams.

“We are not going to let some
of the country’s best divers come
in here and intimidate us,” Cruz
said. “It is not like we are going
to be made fools of; we can keep

up.

Pitt will be a little shorthanded
in its quest to keep up. The
decision was made last week to
substitute one swimmer, senior
Matt Porter, at the expense of
three underclassmen divers. Only
Cruz, Sean Braud and Mike

Naylor will compete in the
championship meet.

“It was a very tough decision,
but, without being negative, I
wouldn’t mind putting in a plug
for our next three divers,” Krug
said. “I honestly believe that our
divers would have scored well

and that Steve Wolfe would have ’

finished in the top eight in both
events. But that is the way it goes
sometimes. Matt will score, too,
and a senior going out the right
way is important.

“lPorterl has been prepared all
season long to go out at the’Big
East Championships. He has
-swum the best times of his life,
and it is kind of tough [to keep
him out of the meet],” Krug said.

Krug accepted the decision,
but said he regrets how it all had
to come about.

“I think that the handwriting
was on the wall a long time ago
and it was just a tough thing for
[head coach Chuck Knolesl to
approach me with,” Krug said.

beginning,_he would have geared
Wolfe toward the NCAA
qualifying meet rather than the
Big East Championships.
Considering he is missing this
year’s biggest meet and his last
chance at qualifying for NCAAs,
Wolfe has handled it quite well,
according to Krug.

“Steve handled it the way I
expected: in control but pissed
off,” he said.

Big East Championship in the
years to come, but this will be
Cruz’s last one and he would like
to go out in sty1e._He swept third
place in both diving events last
year, and although the odds of
repeating that performance are
longer this year, he will give it his
best shot.
. “I’m not real nervous yet, but
usually I will get a little nervous
the day of the event,” Cruz said.
“Hopefully that will be a positive
attribute, because a 1-ittle bit of
nervousness is a good thing in
competition as long as you don’t
let it overwhelm your
performance.”

Cruz made quite a splash at the «,3

NCAA qualifying meet last year,
diving well enough to advance to
the national championship meet
on the 1-meter board. He will
take one last shot at making the
NCAA Championships when he
dives in the qualifying meet at
Princeton over spring break.
The Panthers’ chances of
pressing the Miami divers improve
with the health of sophomore
Sean Braud. At top form, he has
the ability to compete with the

nation’s best divers. Earlier this 

season he beat current NCAA
platform champion David Pichler
on the 5-meter board. But illness
and an infection in his left ear
have kept him out of the water
for a week. He has been working
out on the trampoline and diving
into thick cushions to stay in

' shape and should be back in the

water by either today or
tomorrow.

‘‘I think, in spite of his health
problems, Sean will rise to the
occasion,” Cruz said. “He is a hell
of an athlete and fierce
competitor.”
