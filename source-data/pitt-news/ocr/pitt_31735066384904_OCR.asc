Mosque closes gates
to Pitt football fans

By Scot Ross

and Marc Duchin
The Pitt News

A Pitt Football tradition ended

just prior to Saturday's opener
against Northern Iowa.

It was not an announcement
that Bill Hillgrove would be giv-
ing up his job as play—by-play
man, nor was it an interview that
said Mike Gottfried would switch
the Panthers to a wishbone
offense.

This controversial amendment
to the implied Pitt football con-
stitution is that the Syria Mosque
Parking Lot, longtime home to
Pitt tailgaters young and old,
would no longer open its lot to
the likes of partying Pitt football
fans.

Representatives of the Syria
Mosque were unavailable for
comment on the reasons sur-
rounding this move.

Senior Dave Calabrese contact-
ed The Pitt News because, as he
explained, ”We’re really upset
about it  theturnout is far be-
low what a party should be. No-
body knows where to go. We're
all spread out because there's not
one large central area where we
can all congregate.”

Calabrese said that while he
couldn't get in touch with the
Mosque’s front office to inquire
about tailgating, he did speak to
one parking lot attendant who at-
tributed the move to trash
removal and general problems
stemming from that. S

He added that the change has
been ”detrimental” to the
amount of people who tailgate.
He hopes, however, that students
will continue to gather as they al-
ways have.

Creek rush underway as fraternities schedule events

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

For the new batch of incoming
freshmen, there are many aspects
of Pitt life to be experienced. The
spacious Towers, the communi-
ty bathrooms, the soft rain that al-
ways falls during football games.

And the Pitt Greeks’ fraternity
rush.

Rush, which started Aug. 29,
gives freshmen and other interest-
ed students the opportunity to
view and perhaps join one of
Pitt's fraternities on campus.

”What we did differently this
year is, we were more active as
far as the advising sessions [for
freshmen]. We held up a table
and a booth at each advising ses-
sion,” said lnterfraternity Coun-
cil President Chuck Farinella.

”The whole thinking in the mat— .

ter was to try to give the freshmen
as much time as possible to make
the best decision for themselves.
Rush extends from Aug. 29 to
Sept. 15, and that's only 17 days
to choose amongst 20 frater-
nities.”

The first couple of days of rush

were big group events, with the
Watermelon Picnic and Meet the
Greeks on Aug. 30, to give some

exposure to the individual frater-

nities. ”Most freshmen come in
and they don't know what's go-
ing on,” said IFC Internal Vice
President Dave Wilcox, explain-
ing the need for these kinds of
events. ”They don't know what
rush means, they don't know
what the fraternities stand for,
what the Greeks “do.”

After the 30, the separate
houses stage their own rush
events. Due to the fact that Pitt

has a dry rush, most of the frater-
nities have madetheir events
more varied and interesting. One
of the rush events of Zeta Beta
Tau was a trip to the Buhl Science
Center to see ”Lazer Floyd.”
”Lazer Floyd” is a laser show
viewed on "a domed ceiling to the
music of Pink Floyd.

”Long term [dry rush] has
worked,” said Wilcox. ”At first,
everyone fought it because it was
a change and people don't like to
change. Now, everyone who has
been through both realizes you
get better quality people to

pledge your house.”

”I like the fact that it's not all
just partying,” said Paul Miller, a
rushing freshman. ”They have
the academics, too. It's more or
less a brotherhood.”

After the first two events, the
number of rushees was around
400, according to Farinella and
Wilcox, and that\number will
probably increase. As for how
many of the rushees will get bids,
Farinella said, ”|t’s up to the
house in question. Some people
say, well, we’re going for num-

Reinstated l\ew StudentI\etwork strives for human rights

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

After losing and subsequently

regaining their university affilia- -

tion last winter, the New Student
Network is making plans for this
year's fall term.

The NSN, a University of Pitts-
burgh organization dedicated to
the preservation of human rights,
will meet next week with new
members to discuss tentative
plans for the upcoming year.

The meeting-is designed to in-
form new, members about the
group and to provide current
members with a forum open for
the discussion of new ideas.

The NSN will also submit the
necessary forms to the Student
Government Board tomorrow for
the acquisition of an office and
for emergency funds.

NSN President Angie Hirsch
said that her organization is ap-
plying for emergency funds be-
cause it is too late in the year to

submit a budget. She explained
that the SGB will vote separately
on each proposal for funds. She
said that, after the government
board’s vote, the NSN will not be
allowed an appeal.

Hirsh said she is confident that T

the board will approve the or-
ganization’s request.

According to Hirsch, the NSN
has, at this point, a very tentative
schedule of events.

One of the NSN’s tentative pro-
grams is to hold a forum to dis-

cuss the pros and cons of the
government's ROTC programs at
Pitt.

Hirsch said that those for and
against these programs will be
equally represented and that
these activities will not include
protest.

NSN member Bill Frizlen said,
”We want to make students
aware of the issues, [but] we
don't want to be abrasive. We
want people to go away
thinking.”

During the year, the NSN plans
to set up a table to accept sup-
plies for students in San Isidro,
Nicaraugua.

After meeting with these stu-
dents last spring, Hirsch said that
they are in need of supplies such
as pens, pencils, baseballs and
basketballs. '

Hirsh added that in March of
1987, Pittsburgh Mayor Caliguiri
declared San Isidro Pittsburgh's
”sister city”.

Gadhafidenies Libyan connections to terrorism

TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) - Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi on
Monday challenged the United
States to prove accusations that
he sponsors terrorism and said he

expects relations with Washing-
ton to improve under the next ad-

ministration.
Gadhafi said in an interview

with The Associated Press that he
would like to visit the United

States ”if things were different”
and that Libya remains a close

friend of the Soviet Union despite

improved U.S.-Soviet relations.
Gadhafi said Americans who
believe President Reagan’s

charge that he sponsors terrorism
are ”very simple people, ignorant

people.”
’’I challenge everyone in the

world to give evidence [that Libya

backs terrorism],” he said.
Reagan accused Cadhafi of
sponsoring the December 1985

attacks that left 20 people dead

at airports in Rome and Vienna.

U.S. warplanes bombed Libya
in April 1986 in an attack that
killed 37 people, including Gad-
hafi’s 15-month-old adopted
daughter. The raid was intended
to punish Libya for its role in the
April 5 bombing of a West Ger-
man nightclub in which two
American soldiers and a Turkish
woman were killed.

\ A July 11 terrorist attack that
killed nine people on a Greek
cruise ship was linked to Abu Ni-
dal, who is believed to travel fre-
quently to Libya.

”Of course, we are against im-
perialism, racism and Zionism,”
said Cadhafi. ”We are not wrong,
we are right to defend our in-
terests.

Animal rights group
misses pigeon shoot

EAST GREENVILLE, Pa. (AP) —

NEWS BRIEFS

About 200 animal rights activists
were about a half—hour late for a
Labor Day pigeon shoot at the
Powderbourne Gun Club Mon-
day, an official said.

The pigeon shoot, which was
conducted as a competitive sport
by enthusiasts, drew more than
100 participants, said Kee Bub-
benmoyer, vice president of the
Pennsylvania Flyers Association,
a state-wide group of pigeon
shooters.

”We shoot feral pigeons,
which are live-trapped in cities or
grain areas where they are caus-
ing economic damage or posing
health problems,” he said.

At least 200 demonstrators ar-
rived at noontime, about 30
minutes‘ after the shooting
stopped, according to Dana

Stuchell, vice president of Trans-
Species Unlimited.

”But we held the protest any-
way,” Stuchell said.

Reagan campaigns
for Bush and future

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP)
— President Reagan is planning
dual fall campaigns: an overt po-
litical one on behalf of George
Bush and the other an effort to
wring a wish list of items from an
election—minded Congress.

’’I’m sure the president's
philosophy right now is very
much — ‘So little time and so
much to do,’ " said Kenneth
Duberstein, Reagan's chief of
staff.

THEFPITTINEWS, Tuesday, September 6, l988

By Mindy Boffemmyer
News Editor

How do Pitt students spend
their money? A demographic
study commissioned by The
Pitt News and conducted by
Market Opinion Research of
Detroit provides some insight.

The study was conducted,
from Jan. 26 to Feb. 3, to give
Pitt News advertisers an idea
of how Pitt students spend
their money.

Study results are based on
300 phone interviews be-
tween randomly selected stu-
dents, faculty and staff
members, and trained tele-
phone interviewers. Neither
the interviewer nor the respon-
dent knew for whom the sur-
vey was being conducted.

A common complaint of
university students in a rural

ing to do. Pitt students have
just the opposite problem.
The Downtown, Shadyside,
Squirrel Hill and South Side
sections of the city are all just
minutes away. The location of
Oakland gives Pitt students,
who have a collective buying
income of over $64 million,
an abundance of places to
shop, dine and be entertained.
The demographic study
showed that of the approxi-
mately 28,000 students en-
rolled at the University of
Pittsburgh, the vast majority
are employed. But regardless
of whether they receive their

setting is that they have noth— .

incomes from jobs, their par-
ents or student loans, the aver-
age Pitt student spends
approximately $190 a month.

Students spend about
$24,859,952, and faculty and
staff members spend about
$32,801,288 in supermarkets,
bakeries, produce markets and
convenience stores annually.

However, some students
either don't like to cook or
don't have the time. Over the
course of a year, students
spend $10,214,916 at full-
service restaurants, and near-
ly 8 out of 10 students eat at
a fast—food restaurant at least
once a week.

College students are also
fond ofwine, liquor and beer.
Pitt students spend a total of
$6,651,504 a year on alcohol,
while faculty and staff spend
$1,915,992.

According to the Market
Opinion Research study, stu-
dents are notoriously big
spenders when it comes to
music. Within the past year,
students have spent about
$4,435,200 on records, tapes
and CD5.

Also, over the course of a
year, 50 percent of the stu-
dents surveyed purchased a
stereo, television set or other
electronic equipment.

lnside of 53 percent of Pitt
students’ wallets a credit card
can be found, and 75 percent
of students use ATM banking
cards. .

Students spend approxi-

Where do students spend money?

mately $6,405,000 per year
on toiletries, including mouth-
wash, shampoo, soap, mousse
and toothpaste. Members of
the Pitt faculty and staff spend
$1,595,544 annually on their
toiletries.

Drug stores are the most
common place to purchase
these items, and in a given
month, 84 percent of our stu-
dents, faculty and staff shop in
a drug store.

According to the survey, stu-
dents spend a lot of money
staying in fashion. Collective-
ly, students spend about
$19,835,538 on shoes, cloth-
ing and accessories, while
faculty and staff spend approx-
imately $5,352,216 annually.

While small boutiques and
specialty stores are frequented
by students, most seem to
prefer department and dis-
count stores.

Over the course of a year,
students spend $1,394,154 on
computer hardware, software
and supplies; faculty and staff
spend about $1,267,488.

In between term papers and
reading assignments, students
like to attend movies, theaters,
concerts and plays. One third
of Pitt students enjoy these ac-
tivities at least once a week.

Pitt students like to purchase
things that will keep them
busy, according to the study.
A total of 11,682 people plan
to make a sporting goods pur-

, chase within the month.

R.A.s dispel myths
about chaperoning

By Sandra Kramer
For The Pitt News

The job of a Resident Assistant,
or R.A., as it is more commonly
called, is one that entails much
more than the administration of
discipline to Pitt students in dor-
mitories.

According to Maureen McCul-
lough, an R.A. in Tower A, ”|t’s
a job that requires a lot of
paperwork.”

The R.A. program is one that
can be very time-consuming. Be-
fore one can actually hold the ti-
tle of R.A., he or she must have
an overall grade point average of
2.5 and be at least a junior. Then
he must fill out an application,
complete an essay and go
through a series of interviews
with other R.A.s, the Office of
Residence Life and Resident
Directors who are in charge of an
entire dorm. Once accepted into
the R.A. program, a week-long
workshop must be attended be-
fore dorm students come to
school.

”We learned a lot about poli-
cies, emergency procedures and
counseling. It helped all of the
R.A.s develop a feeling of unity,”
said McCullough.

During the interim of the
school year, each R.A. is required
to complete seven floor projects
with a report. These include
projects exemplifying emotional,
intellectual, occupational, social,
diverse, physical and other valu-

able aspects of student life.

For example, Chris Farmakis,
an R.A. in Tower A, says,”For my
social project, I organized a game
of Win, Lose or Draw, similar to
the TV show, between my floor
and another. We had fun playing
and then enjoyed ‘O’ fries and
drinks while I got the chance to
observe and complete that
project.”

He adds, ”For my physical
report, 1 am planning a football
game between my floor and
another in our Tower. An exam-
ple of a value project would be
having a discussion about sex
with the guys on my floor.”

R.A.s are also required to hold
two weekday duty nights per
week and then an additional
seven duty weekends per year.
This means staying in their rooms
from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. for the
weekday nights and from Friday
8 p.m. to Monday 8 a.m. for the
designated weekends.

Farmakis explained how he
feels about dealing with dis-
cipline: ”lt’s a job where I have
to separate my personal opinions
from my professional opinions. I
don't find a problem with dis-
cipline because I know that dis-
cipline is part of my job.”

Denny Maurer, another R.A.,
adds, ”Drugs, alcohol and noise
are the three main problems I've
encountered.”

’’I don't enjoy disciplining, but

, it's part of my job,” said McCol-

Walk on by...

The new ”Keep Off Grass” policy of Soldiers and Sailors’ lawn has gone by at least one
wayward traveler. ls his trot a mere short cut, or is it an act of civil disobedience,
protesting the fact that apparently all gone are the spring days of frisbee throwing and
scoring that all-important tan on the broad lawns of the Oakland memorial?

are looking for quality."

"I think [the Greeks] are all
right. There are a lot of cool guys
and they’re all friends, so it seems
like something to be in,” said
freshman Vince Dellanovan.
"You're just like in a society here
and everybody takes roles."

For current rushees, Wilcox ad-
vises looking into a variety of
fraternities. "A lot of times, fresh-
men will get caught into a trap

. where they meet two kids from

a certain fraternity. They'll feel
comfortable with them, and
they'll rush that one particular
house and they won't even look
anyplace else.”

"I think where [rush] can im-
prove is with the students who
are commuters. The commuters
pop in and out and we really
don't have much of an opportu-
nity to get them informed about
the Greek system, and a lot of
times they don't even think that
option’s open to them.

’’I'd tell them, if you've got the
time, invest every spare minute
into going to every house out
there, meeting people from all
the houses,” said Farinella.

”They didn't seem to
cause many problems.
The only problem that
could be present is un-
derage drinking. It’s a
tradition.”

Tailgate—

viewed described the new tailgat-
ing places as ”weak” in many
respects and felt that they were ”a
little more dead” than the Syria
Mosque. Some were confident,
though, that the new sites would
become as enjoyable as the Syr-
ia Mosque was. .

”When they break your old tra-
dition, all you've got to do is cre-
ate a new one. Simple as that.
Give it two weeks,” said Tom
Krvacs.

Two parking lot attendants who
refused to be identified comment-
ed that the tailgating Saturday at
one particular parking lot would
be its last. ”These kids don't want
to move. We're trying to conduct
business.”

They said that while there has
been tailgating at that lot in the
past, this is the first time that there
has been a real problem with it.

Tailgating at the Mosque

is worth another chance

Pitt football fans received good news and bad news on Satur-
day. The good news was that the Panthers beat Northern Iowa
by a considerable margin. The bad news was that the Syria
Mosque, located on Bigelow Boulevard, will allow no further
tailgating on its parking lot.

The practice of tailgating at the Syria Mosque hasbecome
increasingly popular over the last few years. The activity in-
volves students and alumni gathering by specified cars to bar-
becue, drink beer, listen to music and ”prepare” for the
upcoming football game. Tailgaters have been seen across the
country at most every sporting event, amateur or professional.
The purpose of the event can be compared to a high school
pep rally.

It is truly a sport for fans.

With the loss of theSyria Mosque’s support, Pitt football fans
Will Be rareea t6 leek elsewhere to congregate and express their
Panther loyalty. The Mosque served as a centerpiece for Pitt
tailgaters and provided the biggest party in town on game day.

The Syria Mosque has not offered a clear explanation of its
policy to tailgaters beyond the’ notification of a sign; it is un-
derstandable that some students are angry.

It is also understandable and responsible for the Syria Mosque
to consider the dangers and liabilities of underage drinking,
property damage and public disturbances tailgating can bring.
However, rather than shutting out the students and alumni, we
suggest that the Syria Mosque seek out other alternatives.
Perhaps the Mosque can charge extra for tailgaters in order to
pay for any neccessary cleaning, request police to patrol the
area, or place a sign warning tailgaters to ”Tailgate at their own
risk.”

Regardless of its motivations, the Mosque should not give

, up on the custom of tailgating. It’s a celebration and a Pitt tra-

dition. It’s all a part of being a fan.

Exploiting Martin Luther King

The 55,000 people who con-
verged on Washington to mark
the 25th anniversary of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King Jr.’s eloquent ”I
Have a Dream” oration were
shortchanged.

King was a selfless man, dedi-
cated to principle, not a political
party. He believed it was possi-
ble to change the hearts of men
and women and, thus, bring

. about racial harmony. Politics

was a means to that end, but
many of those who spoke Satur-
day, most especially the
egomaniac, Jesse Jackson, used
the occasion to advance them-
selves. They see politics as the
end.

King’s widow, Coretta, tried in
vain to keep the remembrance
above partisan politics. She said
before the march that her hus-
band's ”dream of justice, equali-
ty and national unity is not the
exclusive property of any race,
religion or political party." Sad-

ly, it became precisely partisan,

I fostered by a liberal Democratic

Party leadership that cares far
more for the black vote than
black progress.

The Democratic Party has be-
come a dispenser of the welfare
drug. Once hooked, the
"junkies” ask only for a federal
fix and can envision little else.
Not one speaker mentioned the
thousands of blacks.who have
moved into the middle class
since I963. Vice President Ge-
orge Bush, who declined an in-
vitation to appear (why should he
attend a Democratic Party
event?), said in a written message
to the marchers that there has
been ”an explosive growth in the
black middle class,” but that
"these gains are fragile and there
is much left to be done.”

Jackson, whose profession
seems to be to get his face on tel-
evision and his name in
newspapers, set the wrong tone.

Column fails to recognize everyone

I thought that Matt Martin's
thoughts about the homeless
were right on the money.

There is a ring of homeless
criminals in Oakland carrying
stereos, television sets, jacuzzis,
‘refrigerators, mattresses and any-
thing they can steal in their shop-
ping carts and carry on their
shoulders. Homeless children,
homeless students and homeless
veterans are all aligned in this
cause. They became homeless so
they could take advantage of this
crime ring; without a fixed ad-
dress,,_they can evade captu re. Af-
ter bringing their booty to their
cardboard-box store, they sell
everything for five dollars apiece.
How else would they be able to
support their lavish lifestyles?

Jay Katz

Dear Editor,

I’m sick and tired of hearing
about the ’’plight of the blacks.”
Why, just last summer, my friend
was accosted by two young black
men who punched her in the face
and stole her purse. I used to
have sympathy for black people.
I felt sorry for them because they
didn't grow up with all the oppor-
tunities thatl had. But now, after
this incident, I realize that black

(EAL
THOMAS

He bitterly denounced Republi-
cans and flatly predicted that
”George Bush will not be in
Washington for the inauguration
on Jan. 20." King would have
been far more pragmatic than
that, realizing that if opportunities
for blacks are to expand, lines of
communication must be kept
open to both parties.

Robert Woodson is a black
man who did not attend the an-
niversary march. He says he
doesn't believe King would have
come to it either.

President of the National
Center for Neighborhood Enter-
prise, Woodson has written, ”A
new generation of black Ameri-
cans has come of age since the
civil rights movement reached its

LETTERS .

people don't deserve to have the
same opportunities I've had, be-
cause they just don't want to
work hard for a buck; they'd
rather steal it from me. Where do
those affirmative-action mongers
think the black youths you see
walking around downtown get all
of that jewelry from? Or those big
boom boxes?

I used to have sympathy for
Jewish people, too, because there
are a lot of prejudiced people out

"there who won't give them a

chance. But then I discovered
that the president of my bank is

Jewish. With all that money, what

does he need my sympathy for?
I guess it's true: the Jews really do
control the banks. Why should I
feel sorry for them when they
have all that money?

When Matt Martin discovered
a ”street urchin” raiding his
refrigerator univited one morn-
ing, he finally saw the true colors
of those ”bums” (a.k.a. ”saps”).
He realized they ”have put them-
selves in the position that they're
in” and will survive ”however
they can manage to do it,” even
if survival requires them to ”rob

Jr. on his

zenith more than two decades
ago. It is a generation bred on
government dependency and
despair; it is a generation that has
been shortchanged.” . ,
Woodson tells me,”|f racism
ended tomorrow, poor blacks
would be no better off. We tend
to apply race-specific solutions to
economic problems and, in the
process, we diminish both.” He
calls demands for increased fed-
eral spending to cure the
problems of the black poor ”the
social equivalent of Laetrile.” He
wants the black community to
”disentangle itself from the wel-
fare professionals whose liveli-
hood is maintaining clients.”
As real economic progress is
made in black free enterprise,
real political progress is also
made. Black free enterprise,
though limited, has produced im-
pressive results. In cities where
public housing authorities have
allowed residents to manage their

you blind.”

I would like to thank Mr. Mar-
tin for showing me the value of
such sweeping generalizations. I
now realize that if one member
of a group has a particular attrib-
ute, then that trait must be inher-
ent in all members of the group.
If I meet a black person who is
lazy, I can attribute that to the fact
that he is black and assume that
all blacks are lazy.

These types of generalizations
are especially useful for employ-
ers. Why hire women, who, as
we all know, are only interested
in finding husbands? If you hire
a woman for a job, she'll eventu-
ally quit to raise a family, so why
not hire a man to do the job? Af-
ter all, a man won't be following
his wife if she gets a promotion,
and he certainly won't start cry-
ing the minute something goes
wrong. That's how my sister is,
and I certainly wouldn't want her
working for me.

Bravo, Mr. Martin. Maybe now
some of your naive readers will
wise up and stop evaluating peo-
ple as individuals.

THE PITT NEWS

Tuesday, September 6, 1988

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

Pitt junior running back
Adam Walker knew he had to
take Saturday's game against
Northern Iowa, a 59-10 Pan-
ther win, into his own hands.

”Because our defense is so
young and inexperienced right
now, we can't count on them
to make up for our mistakes,”
Walker said. ”The offense is

games this year. We have to
grab the game.”

Walker lived up to his claim
by rushing for 148 yards on 14
carries, including an 89-yard
spurt early in the third quarter
that put the game away for
good.

”Their [UNI] defense was
really pumped up to start the
second half,” Walker said.
”We knew we had to hit them
first. ljust took the ball and ran
for daylight.”

There is more to this story,
though. Earlier in the day, Pitt
receiver Henry Tuten saw
Walker sitting alone in the
hotel where the Panthers stay
before home games.

”I just told him not to be
nervous, because he is the
man this year,” Tuten said.
”Then I told him I was going
to get the block today.”

The whole offense can take
some credit for the 89 yarder,
but Walker knows Tuten car-
ried out his pregame promise.

”Tuten said, ’Adam, |’m go-
ing to spring you,’ ” Walker
said. ”When I got through the
hole, I saw Henry turn and
knock his guy off. It was noth-
ing but end zone after that.”

Northern Iowa coach Earle
Bruce saw Walker’s run as the
turning point of the game.

”You can't let a team go 90
yards on the opening play of
the second half and hope to
compete,” Bruce said. ”If we

going to have to win the“

Walker blossoms in to
starting running back
during Panther’s win
over Northern Iowa

could have stopped them
there and gained a little
momentum, it might have
been a different ballgame. The
run took everything out of us.”

Walker is going into his first
season as the premier back in
the Pitt offense, but he is any-
thing but a surprise.

In limited action last season,
Walker ran for 214 yards on
38 carries in the Craig
Heyward-dominated offense.

”I’m excited about getting
the playing time,” Walker
said. ”I just want to show
everybody what I can do. All
I want to do is contribute to
the team and, hopefully, break
a few. I'm confident of what I
can do. Now I'm ready to play
ball.’’

Walker, a 1986 graduate of
Steel Valley High School, sat
out his freshman year due to
academic ineligibility.

”Adam should be proud of
himself,” Tuten said. ”We are
the only two survivors from
Prop-48. We paid our debt to
society, so to speak, and are
ready to play. I know Adam is
a tough competitor and he
wants to play.”

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried
liked what he saw of Walker
at fall camp and named him
the starter for the first game.
After a game like Saturday's,
Walker may have imbedded
himself in the role.

”I was hoping that he would
have that type of game,” Gott-
fried said. ”Last year when he
played, he was able to break
a few, so we feel he can be
that type of runner. As the sea-
son goes along, we'll try to do
a few more things with him.
But right now, I am very hap-
py with the way he answered
the challenge.”

With Walker’s mix of speed
and power, the Pitt offense
should be a little more well-
rounded this season.

“Battle of Panthers’ turns into Pitt blowout

By Vince Carey and Matt
Martin

' Sports Editors

By now, just about everyone
knows Pitt rolled over-Northern
Iowa, 59-10, Saturday night, but
there are still a few things to clear

up.
01987 — year of the
"Ironhead/’
1988 —- year of the
”Ironherd”?

If Saturday night was any indi-
cation, the answer is yes. Seven
running backs saw action, with
quarterback Darnell Dickerson
adding 63 yards to the Panthers’
349 total yards rushing.

The offensive backfield also put
30 points on the scoreboard.

What may be most impressive

about the back’s production is
how the freshmen came through
for the Panthers. Four first—year
players (Curvin Richards, David
Moore, Ricky Turner and Glenn
Deveaux) and one redshirt fresh-
man (Ronald Redmon) performed
admirably, combining for 134
yards rushing and one score.

Junior fullback Dan Crossman
also scored the first touchdown of
his Pitt career with a 5-yard scam-
per in the first quarter.

Tailback Adam Walker's
89-yard bust in the opening mo-
ments of the third quarter is the
second longest run from scrim-
mage in Pitt history. The record
of 91 yards is held by George
McLaren, set against Syracuse in
1917.

The run also took all of the

wind out of UNI. At the end of
the first half, UNI put together
two long drives to make the score
a respectable 28-10 game.

UNI came back at the end of
halftime with momentum, but
Walker's run took away any up-
set hopes.

Walker finished with 148 yards
rushing and two touchdowns in
less than three full quarters of
play.

0 Alonzo Hampton’s 71-yard
punt return for a touchdown was
the first since Tom Flynn's
63-yarder against Louisville in

1982.

0 Even though the biggest
news about the Pitt offense was
that they would be running the
option play with regularity this
season, it still took UNI coach
Earle Bruce by surprise.

”They are really good with the
option,” Bruce said. ”We had
heard through the grapevine that
they would run the option, but
we had so many other things to
worry about that we didn’t spend
that much time with practicing
for the play.”

Bruce was more impressed
with Dickerson than with any
other aspect of the game.

”I was very much impressed
with Dickerson. He is very much
improved, does a lot of good
things with the option and he can

pass that ball a mile. They have
a very fine attack. That offense
could cause people some trouble
this season.”

0 Pitt will have to get better
production from their punting
game. Yusef Washington, who, in
all fairness, was thrust into the job
at the last moment, shanked three
of his four kicks. Wahington had
punts of 20 yards, 25 yards, 25
yards and 44 yards. That's an
average of 27 yards per punt.

0 What would a Pitt night
home game be without rain?

Defenensive backfield
shows Pitt weekness ‘
during opening game

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

The score would never indicate
it, but much of the Pitt Panther
defense struggled during Saturday
night's 59-1 0 victory over North-
ern Iowa.

1987 ECAC Rookie of the Year
Marc Spindler had only one tack-
le in four quarters. High|y—touted
middle linebacker Jerry Olsavsky
had only three tackles, all as-
sisted.

Kind of surprising, considering
Northern Iowa is a |—AA team, not
at all in Pitt's league.

The Pitt defense has been one
of the best in the country for two
years running. And despite the in-
experience of the T988 Panthers,
this year should not see them
make a turn for the worse.

Comparisons may be unfair to
the players on this year’s roster,
but they are nearly the only way

to gauge a player. And the com-
parisons between the 1988 and
1987 Panther secondary are
almost nonexistent as of this
point.

”We have a long way to go,”
said senior free safety Troy
Washington, who had four tack-
Ies, three assisted.

”We have a very young
defense. A lot of championship
teams win because of defense,”
Washington said. ”The separate
quarters show that we are a very
young defense.”

The only Northern Iowa touch-
down of the game came on a
second—quarter pass from UNI

quarterback Ken Macklin that.

split the Pitt secondary.

”To be a championship team,
we can't allow things like that to
happen,” Washington, 6-foot-2,
190 pounds, added. ”We went
up 28-nothing [in the second
quarter], and we got a little lack-
adaisical.” .

The season opener against UNI
saw three defensive backs (left
cornerback Alonzo Hampton,
right cornerback Cornell Hollo-
way and strong safety Marcus
Washington) gain their first starts
at Pitt. '

Expected starting strong safety
Louis Riddick was sidelined with
a pulled hamstring, forcing (Mar-
cus) Washington into the starting
role.

If the game was an indication
of things tU came for the entire
team, then the secondary has a
lot of work to do.

”They [Northern Iowa] were
sticking it to us for a while,” T.
Washington said. ”We just have
to pull it up and come in and
watch film and just get together.
It's going to take time because

we're a young team, but we're

going to overcome that.”

”We’re a long, long way from
being a good football team,” said
head coach Mike Gottfried.
”Defensively  the second quart-
er, we were completely out of
sync.

”The whole defensive team is
pretty young, and a lot of it is mis-
takes, but not mistakes of effort,”
Gottfried added.

Some bright spots did shine‘

through in the contest. M.
Washington proved an able back-
up to Riddick, contributing six
tackles and half a sack. Hampton
and junior reserve cornerback
Robert Bradley put some punish-
ing hits on opposing receivers,
and both finished with six tackles.
Holloway added seven tackles.

tempts (20-14) and the ever-
unimportant possession time
(31:52-28:08).

Pitt led in rushing attempts
(47-44) and total offensive yards
(471-T 74). The teams tied in first
downs, with T5 apiece.

There were a few lopsided
lines also. Pitt gained 345 yards
rushing, while UNI was held to
a measly 7T. Pitt returned kicks
for a total of 102 yards; UNI end-
ed the game with -2.

0 Did anyone notice that the
Pitt Band has new seats for the
game? This has got to be a god-
send for the fans, who can actu-
ally hear themselves talk to each
other now without screaming.

0 Senior receiver Billy Osborn
put a nice move on the defensive
backs during his 54-yard touch-
down reception. UNI was in dou-
ble coverage on the play, Osborn
jogged down the sideline until
the d-backs were a little lax, then
put on a burst of speed and actu-
ally had to wait for the pass.

0 Lee McRae showed why he
will be a force in the offense.
McRae reported in during a ser-

ies in the second quarter. He was
split wide and then took off down
the field. He was 30 yards behind
his coverman before anybody
knew what happened.

If McRae can get his hands on
the ball in the open field, nobody
will ‘ever touch him.

0 Defensive end Burt Gross-
man led the Pitt defense with
nine tackles, including two sacks,
not to mention a number of quar-
terback hurries and causing
general havoc all around the ball.

0 Defensive tackle Tom Sims,
a transfer from Western Michi-
gan, was a somewhat-of-a-
surprise starter but made the most
of it. Sims was a force in the back-
field and led the team with three
and a half sacks. He had the UNI
offense looking his way before
every play.

0 The 1987 Pitt penalty bug
seems to have carried over into
this season. The Panthers were
called for a whopping ll penal-
ties, including a pass interference
penalty by defensive back Cor-
nell Holloway with 1:06 left be-
fore the end of the first half.

return to Pittsburgh

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

It didn't take long, but Billy
Owens came right back to the
place where he started.

Well, at least temporarily.

In July, he left the University of
Pittsburgh as a lOth-round draft
pick. This past Sunday, he
returned as a member of the Dal-
las Cowboys.

Owens, considered to be a
long shot to make the team, is
now a second-string safety for the
Cowboys, behind Michael
Downs‘ and Bill Bates. But the
former two—year starter at Pitt
hasn't become too upset about
role with the
Cowboys.

”After I was drafted, all that
was on my mind was making the
squad. Things didn't go well for

me in the draft. I expected-to go 1

my hardest, and things worked
out.”

Owens saw limited action in
Sunday's 24-21 opening-day loss
to the Pittsburgh Steelers, his
duties being regulated to situation
substitutions and kick coverages.
But he did make a big play late
in the game that almost helped
the Cowboys win.

With little more than two
minutes to play in the game, Pitts-
burgh was faced with a third-and-
eight situation on its own 22-yard
line. The play called for Steeler
quarterback Bubby Brister to roll
out to his right in search of an
open receiver. His targets were
all covered, so Brister decided to
make a run for it.

But place-kicker Luis Zendejas’
49-yard field goal attempt fell
short, and Dallas suffered only
the sixth opening—day defeat in
franchise history.

No big deal. There are 15 more
games to go. And Owens is hap-
py the first one is all over with.

’’I guess every rookie goes
through the first-game jitters,”
said Owens. ”I thought it would
be strange playing back to Pitts-
burgh, but all the things I had to
remember on the field clogged
my mind, so I didn't have time to
think about that.

”I had to make sure I got all my
assignments right. That was my
biggest worry. I'm just happy I got
a chance to play. I hope as the
season goes on, my role [on
defense] increases."

After the game, a well-known
coach came over to Owens in the
dressing room and had a few
words with him. No, itwasn’t his

Although the defensive back-
field may have been a little rusty,
T. Washington believes that Pitt
has one thing that will always
work in its favor.

”The best asset we have on our
whole team is that coach Uohn]
-Fox is a great teacher of the
game.” r

Fox is in his third year as defen-
sive coordinator and secondary
coach. ‘

But even Fox can't help the

secondary once they’re on the ‘

field. With Division I Ohio State
waiting to play Pitt on September
17, T. Washington knows what
the D-backs must do to improve
their game.

”Settling down and being more
patient. I think we got a little too
radical out there,” T. Washington
said. ”Everyone started getting a
little tense and a little nervous.
Then we started lining up wrong,
we started seeing different for-
mations.

”I think that was because of the
youngness of our team, but it will
come in time,” T. Washington
concluded.

Lady Panthers cross country team
prepare for opening of ‘B8 season

Strong nucleus expected
to lead Panther soccer



team into ’88 campaign

By Mike Rampa

For The Pitt News

The 1988 men's soccer team is
looking forward to bouncing
back from last season's disap-
pointing 5-10-1 record. The Pan-
thers have suffered the loss of
only three seniors — Dave Moss
and captains Mike Grimes and
Kurt Weber.

Most of last year's team is
returning and should provide ”an
extremely strong nucleus,” ac-
cording to head coach Joe Lux-
bacher, now in his fourth season.
” The team is comprised of most-
ly sophomores and juniors, with
a few seniors scattering the
roster,” Luxbacher said.

When asked what he and the
team hope to accomplish this sea-
son, Luxbacher stated simply,
”We hope to play up to our capa-
bi|ities.”

The Panthers face some formid-
able opponents in the Big East
conference, most notably Seton
Hall, ranked fourth in the nation
last year. Georgetown, Villanova
and last season's division winner,
St. John's, will all provide stiff
competition for the young yet
solid Panther team.

One of the problems the Pan-
thers faced last year was losing
close games.

”Last season, we lost a few crit-
ical games that were well within

‘ our reach,” Luxbacher said. ”We

lost to Georgetown 1-0 and also
lost to St. John's in overtime.”
Luxbacher hopes to combat

It was Mike Gottfried, Owens’
coach at Pitt, just stopping by
briefly to offer some support and
good luck to his former safety.

Mike Gottfried is known for
showing concern and interest
towards his ex—players, and
Owens seemed appreciative of
the gesture.

By then, the interview was
winding down. After Gottfried
walked away, Owens, somewhat
emotional, turned and said, ”One

the help of his returning veterans,

including Captain Sam Lanza at‘

striker, plagued last year by a
broken jaw. Also returning are
senior John Ascher at stopper and
Dan Liberati at sweeper fullback.

Luxbacher hopes that the addi-
tion of Heinz Pak and Mark
Mostinckx, both of whom trans-
ferred from Community College
of Allegheny County, will also
provide leadership.

Luxbacher sees the opportuni-
ty to turn many of last season's
close decisions in the Panthers’
favor this year by taking advan-
tage of crucial scoring opportuni-
ties and solid defense headed by
Ascher and Liberati.

For The Pitt News

The women's cross country
team will be facing an uphill
battle when their season opens
with the California Invitation-
al on Sept. 10. The battle will
be not so much between the
Lady Panthers and other
teams, but actually against
themselves.

As it seems with most Pitt
sports this year, the Lady Pan-
thers will again rely on upper-
classmen to fill the top spots
on the squad. Last year's top
five — Robin Hubeauer, Glor-
ia Azeke, Debbie Riley, Kath-
leen Chrissos and Ellen Ayoob
—— placed seventh (out of nine
teams) at the Big East Meet.
But head coach John Vasvary
and assistant coach Jim Lear
are hoping that the team will
be able to better compete in
the league this season.

_”What we're hoping to gain

this year is some respectabili-
ty,” said Lear. ”We’re not
rebuilding but simply build-
ing, considering we never had
a really good season. We lost
only Riley to graduation, so
the experience from last year
should be valuable.”

Lear pointed out that the
women's program is in the
same position as the men's
was a few years ago, finishing
near the bottom of the Big
East, but that the men's team
has turned into one of the top
squads in the conference.

The main reason for the
team's string of unsuccessful
seasons, according to Lear, is
the difficulty in recruiting top
runners.

”Western Pennsylvania is
not known for producing top
female runners, but top male
runners  That fact, in addi-
tion to the difficulty in recruit-
ing runners from out of state
makes it doubly hard to even

begin building a strong team,”
Lear said.

”All we need is one well-
known, successful girl to come
in. That would attract more
girls to come, thus building the
program, which is exactly
what happened when we
brought in Paul Friedrich for
the men's team,” Lear con-
tinued.

”Since then, we've had two
successful recruiting years,
and now we are able to com-
pete with the top programs,”
he added.

”But for this season we'll
have to rely on the upperc|ass-
men and hopefully move into
the top five in the Big East. If
we could do that, Coach Vas-
vary and I would be extreme-
ly pleased. That may be what

we need to attract the better fe-
male runners," Lear con-
cluded.

‘Canes move to No. 1 after 31-0 victory

By Herschel Nissenson
AP Football Writer

The Miami Hurricanes, college
football's defending national
champions, have regained the
No. 1 rankingjust one game into
the new season.

Saturday night's 31-0 trouncing
of Florida State, the preseason
No. 1 team, vaulted Miami from
sixth place to the top -in this
week's Associated Press poll.
Nebraska remained No. 2, while
Florida State dropped to 10th.
Texas and Washington replaced
No. 11 Texas A&M and No. 18
Tennessee in the Top 20.

Miami received 38 of 60 first-
place votes and 1,149 of a possi-
ble 1,200 points from a nation-
wide panel of sports writers and
sportscasters. Nebraska, which
has been No. 2 in each of this
season's three polls, received 14
first—place votes and 1,1 13 points
following a 63-13 rout of Utah
State.

Miami coach Jimmy Johnson
isn't getting caught up in the No.
1 hype at this point.

’’It’s really too early in the sea
son for a coach to be concerned
about the rankings,” Johnson said
Monday. ’’I wouldn't even ad-
dress it one way or another.

”We have a very young team
and a lot of difficult games to
play. Our only concern right now
is going up and playing Michigan
[on Sept. 1 7] in a place that's very
difficult to play in. All we've done
is win one game.”

Clemson, a 40-7 winner over
Virginia Tech, climbed from
fourth to third with three first-
place votes and 1,003 points. Ok-
lahoma, which opens its season
this week at North Carolina,
slipped from third to fourth with
two first-place votes and 969
points.

UCLA held on to fifth place by
crushing San Diego State 59-6.
