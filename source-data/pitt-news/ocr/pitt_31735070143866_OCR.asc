Senate passes

$810 billion

bailout plan,

' WASHINGTON (MCT) — In
a historic vote, the Senate ap-
proved a massive $700 billion res-
cue plan for the nation’s ﬁnance
system yesterday night, but only
after tacking on another $110 bil-
lion ‘in tax breaks’ to lure votes
from both parties.

A stxong bipartisan majority
rallied behind the controversial
\Wall Street bailout package, pass-
ingiit 7425.

The vote sends the measure to
an uncertain fate in the House of

' Representatives, where lawmakers

rejected the original version Mon-
day, 228-205. A new House vote
is expected tomorrow, and many

lawmakers in both parties there

remain opposed.

President Bush, Treasury Sec-
retary Henry Paulson and Federal
Reserve‘ Chairman Ben Bernanke
have warned repeatedly that fail—
ure to pass the legislation would
lead vital credit markets to seize
up, forcing employers to lay off
employees and plunging the econ-
omy into recession and perhaps
even another Great Depression.

Heinz Chapel service honors Keiko

' by Nicole McIntyre
T For the Pitt New

Students and colleagues gathered
in Heinz Chapel yesterday for a me-
morial service in memory of Keiko
I. McDonald, the Pitt professor who
drowned during a ﬁshing trip Sept.
14 at the age of 68.

“Tm going to miss having her
around, but I do celebrate whatshe
gave us for 30 years,” saidjohn Coo-
per, dean of the School of Arts and
Sciences, at the service. ‘ ‘

W/hile many colleagues and for-
mer students spoke of McDonald’s

life, all were also quick to point out -

the same attributes of her character.
They said she was passionate, enthu-
siastic, educated, well—w1itten and al-
ways greeted everyone with a smile.’
“Beingin aiclass taught by Keiko
was like having class with your favor-
ite grandma,” said Pitt student Jona-
than Rennie. “Even not knowing her
well, she is certainly unforgettable”
Rennie, a Japanese major, also
acknowledged McDonald’s many
published works. “She knew how to
write,” he said.

McDonald has wntten eight
books and more than 40 articles.

Hiroshi Nara, the chair of the
Japanese  and linguistics
department andphired by McDon¥

aid 21 years ago, attiibuted her great I

success and accomplishments to her
extreme self—discipline.

“She did everything with full
speed. This applies to her teaching,
research and -play,” said Nara. “She
got more done in one day than I
could in a wee .” I V V

McDonald once told Nara, “Just
try to write one page a day, and at
the end of the year, you will have a
book” I

,“The loss of Keiko, is larger than
the loss of a faculty member,” said
Nara. “She left a huge hole. This
event will change the character of
this department for many years to
come.” ’ ~

Charles McDonald described his
wife’s passion for Pitt, speciﬁcally in

educating the students as well as the

faculty.
“My wife loved this University,”
he said. “She loved you all.”

applicants with good communication skills,
the right majors, enthusiasm and 'a high
GPA. ’ F

Ahearn said that it was especially impor-
tant for underclassmen to attend the event
so that they could make connections and
network.

Kathy Humphrey, vice provost and clean
of students, was also intent on making the
job fair an event for all students; not just
seniors and alumni.

“Employers expect students and want
students to learn the purpose of their
companies,” said Humphrey, adding that
this was a way for underclassmen to expose
themselves to these situations. '

The event even had freshmen-specific

q.s~u«n

expose these students to the realities of the
job fair situation. ,

Danielle Filer, a freshman molecular
biology major, went to the fair during the
freshmen—speciﬁc hours. _ V

“I want to know what a job fair looks
like,” she said, adding that she was also in
search of an internship.

Dan Carthew, a senior history major
who plans to go into business or ﬁnance,
was looking for a career. He claimed that
this job fair was much more organized than
those in the past. h

“ltbs a lot bigger and a lot better,” he
said. i

There will be a second University—wide
job fair in the spring.

“Inaction is not an option,”
said Senate Majority Leader Harry

i Reid, D-Nev.. “This is ——I repeat

——- a crisis  We’ve got to get this

Senate Republican Leader
Mitch McConnell, R—Ky., agreed. _
“The question is not how we
got here, but how we get out,”
said McConnell.
Not all senators went along. _
“Action is clearly needed‘ to
return stability to our ﬁnancial
markets, but most importantly,
effective, sound action is needed.
To fix the markets, we must de-
liver a rriarket—based solution, not
a government bailout,” said Sen.

I Elizabeth Dole, R—N.C.

Many lawmakers voiced dis-
dain for the extra tax breaks the
Senate added to the ﬁnancial-res-
cue package. They ranged from a
one—year ﬁx to prevent the alter-
native-minimum tax from hitting
more taxpayers to extending the
research credit for business, to al-
lowing rural utilities to issue tax-
exempt bonds for use of renew-
able energy. K

Also included were more ob-
scure terms extending tax breaks
for motor—sports racing tracks,
makers of T wooden arrows for
children and the rum excise tax
for Puerto Rico and the Virgin

S Islands.

Senate bill would cost the" Trea-
sury an estimated $110 billion
over 10 years, according to Con-

gress’ joint Committee on Taxa-

Pitt improves slightly with‘ "C" grade
on environmental report card

When it comes to being envi-
ronmentally friendly, ‘Pitt is only
average. -

‘ The College Sustainability
Report Card, an "organization
that issues environmental re-
port cards reflecting the green
status of universities across the
country, awarded Pitt with a “C”
—- a minor improvement from
last year’s “C-” and a signiﬁcant
improvement from the “D” it

received in 2006.

The good news is that Pitt

I received “B” grades in the cat-

egories of food and recycling,
transportation and green build-

_ ings.

The not-so-good news is that

i the University received “C”s in
f administration for its efforts in
” advancing the University’s envi-

ronmental initiatives and climate

, change and energyfor its use of

renewable sources of energy. It

The bad news is that Pitt
received failing ' grades when
it comes to endowment trans-
parency, as it has not disclosed

: its endowment holdings or its

shareholder voting record, and
in shareholder engagement, for

' its inability to make “any public

Nonetheless, we commend

of those very recent supporters.
Most attribute three reasons to
the United States’ quick about-

, 1) The United States wants to
push for a strong overall relation-

2) It puts a check on China’s

growing power in East Asia, pre-
venting them from becoming a -

regional hegemony.

3) It gives U.S. energy com-
panies access to a big, emerging
energy market.

much about getting access to bet-

even about partnering up with the

gaining international recognition

why India, above any other na-
tion, deserves the beneﬁts of this

Dear Annie ...

Dear Readers,

Advice is hard to come by — especially if -you need it for something very serious.

' Why isn’t a hangover an acceptable medical excuse for not going to class?

Is it wrong to verbally -harass that girl in the third row of class who won’t shut up? Is *

If I haven’t boughtmy books for half my classes. yet, should I even bother?

Okay, so I’m nothing like Dear Abby, but I am here to help.

Advice can be hard to get when you’re afraid of being judged or afraid of pissing
someone off, or if you’d rather your personal issues didn’t get out into the open.

But what better way to keep our personal business personal than by having it printed
in The Pitt News (semi-anonymously, of course, we won't use your last name)? You can
seek advice for any problem, big or small, plant, animal or mineral, serious or not so seri-

If you have an issue, it’s likely that someone else out there has   problem, and you

Albert Camus once wrote, “But what is happiness except the simple harmony be-
tween a man and the life he leads?” If your life is lacking harmony, that is nothing to be
ashamed of. Too many people go through life and never achieve harmony between them-
selves and their lives. Achieving that balance leads to happiness, and everyone deserves to
be happy. , f A t A ‘ ‘ . .

There is no reason not to take advantage of any opportunity that could bring you
closer ‘to happiness. Asking for help can be hard and sometimes embarrassing, but there’s
no one to judge you because no one will never know who you are. Seeking an answer to
a complicated problem is hardon your own, and there is no reason not to ask for help.
Lots of people askitheir friends for help, but that can pose problems because friends can
be biased. _ y 1 I , I A

“I was working at a car deal-

me one, but he would say to me,
‘A pen is to a salesman as a ham-

on that, I‘ bet a lot of people lose
their pens,” he said.

From there Reda began work-
ing on prototypes for what he
thought would become his first

gauss is a unit of measurement

for magnetism). The premise was A
to have one high-powered mag— .

Contest to award $20,000 to

local innovative inventor

Pittsburgh Innovates
Sponsored by Greater Oakland Key-
stone lnnovation Zone .
www.pittsbur3hinnovates.com
All entries due by Oct. 26

Anybody want an extra $20,000?
Anybody? ’ ~
Pittsburgh's best technological
developers will compete in a new lo-
cal contest, Pittsburgh Innovates, for
a shot at the cash.
, From a bouncing yellow robot
named Keepon (being developed
by CMU grad student Marek Micha-

,lOWSl{l) to design and software studio

DeepL0cal’s text-message event—alert
system, entries for Pittsburgh Inno-
vates come from all walks of life.
The contest, which is in its first
year, is based on creativity and tech-
nology. Students, business owners
and entrepreneurs with a fresh idea
are encouraged to load entries t
pittsburghinnovatescom. H '
There, other people can rate sub-

missions and help‘ select the $10,000
winner. A panel of judges will also
look over each innovation and select
one towin s20,000. '
The contest is arranged by the
Greater Oakland Keystone In-
novation Zone,_ 21 development

organization that “exists to sup-
port entrepreneurs from Carn-

egie Mellon University and the
University of Pittsburg ,” said

coordinator Kathryn Connor. By.

ﬁnancially supporting local col-
lege graduates, the organization can
help create more startup companies.

Connor said the group had
“talked about marketing technology
in the region and educating the com-
munity” It thought “a contest would
be a fun way for the average person
to find out about what’s going on in
technology.” So began Pittsburgh In-
novates.

Each entry must have some kind
of relation to Pittsburgh — whether
it be that the inventor lives or attends

school here, or it benefits or show— »

cases the community.

One such entry comes from
Michele Migliuolo, the CEO of SD
Medical. The one—month—old com-
pany specializes in medical devices

Galbraith of \X/aynesburg, Pa. .

The machine removes nitrogen -

from the air,  it easier for users
to breath. While other similar devices
are already on the market, Migliuolo
insists his product is different.
“Others are all the same Ten

McCain swallowed Whole
by Obamals rock crew

by Justin Jacobs I
/le§E Editor

   

There area lot of hot—button topics surging
through the minds of Americans this election

A season, like who canbetter pull the economy

out of the depths of hell, who can better pull
the army out of the depths of Iraq (or_ not) and

who is more  to die of old age while in the ’

\X/hite House.

As an informed voter, of course, the above
debates plague my mind and haunt my dreams
_But as a music columnist, there’s another de-
bate  — who’s got the better rock stars
in his corner? ’ ‘

Now before you political folkcall me an
idiot and burn an effigy on the Union lawn,

tlefsgetonethingcleartlnnowaydolthink

anyone‘ should base his vote on which can-

didate has a better cache of musicians. That -

would be stupid. watch the debates (tonighfs
should. be downright hysterical!) and make an
informed decision There’s no harm, though,
in pitting presidential iPods against each other
That said, this week a handful of K the

. world’s coolest artists announced that they’d be
)-performing free —— note: FREE — concerts
around the country to support one of the can-
didates These acts include John Legend, Jay-Z,
Billy and the one and only Bruce Spring-

steen, and they’llbethr0wirig dowlf1iforOiba  

throughout the month of October. Other
Obama rockers have included The December-
ists, Kanye West John Mayer, Conor Oberst
of Bright Eyes, Pearl jam, REM andmany,

_ many others

In maybe the coolest fusion of politics in-
ﬂuencing art ever, the original ‘members of The
Grateful Dead are reuniting for a oneoff show
in support of Obama Oct. 13. Unfortunately,
The Dead picked, of all possible venues, toiplay
at Penn State Blast.’ Nonetheless, it seems that,

‘ even more than the 2004 Bush—Kerry election,

the rock stars have aligned to support Obama

‘End of story, right? No? Ah, it appears I’ve
forgotten about McCain.

And, apparently, so has the entirety of rock
’n’ roll V
_ The closest  McCain has to a relevant
rock star supporting him is, embarrassingly,
Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee Yup, that.’s
Springsteen vs. Yankee.

Hell, even the hillbilly supreme Toby Keith
has hinted at supporting Obarna. ‘

Unsurprisingly, the winner, by complete
and utter defeat, is Obama. 

‘D But the story doesn’t stop there Several of
the artists whose music McCain used on the
campaign trail actually asked him to stop, and
some not so politely.

Singer—songwriter]ackson Browne sued the
Ohio Republicans who used his song “Run-
ning on Empty?’ in an ad attacking. Obama
Classic rockers Heart did just about the same
thing. Van Halen made McCain stop  the
hit “Right Now,” and]ohn Mellencamp pull
the plug On“Our Country” _.

It seems that even if McCain did have some
good tunes‘ on his favorite playlist, he’d have to
keep them to himself. _. \

So what does this mean for the election?’
The likely truth is very little Few people will step
into the voting booth in November clueless
and, when 21 Kanye West song pops into 
head, will beﬂsuclderily inspired to go Obama. C

Still, the function of musicians getting in-
volved in politics is, as‘it has always  to
raise awareness When your uninformed, first-
time voter sees Pearl ]am’s Eddie,Vedder pub-
licly saying, l“My name is Eddie Vedder, and I
approve this Obama message,” which he has,
the hope is that said ﬁrst-timer will go online
and check it out for himself '

But in terms of the actual candidates’ musi— C

cal support, let’s just say this — although Daddy
Yankee’s name suggests that he’s Very patriotic,
nobody beats The Boss. .

DiFranco stirs up social commentary on latest

by Alison Smyth
Staff U7/rite/‘

Red Letter Year

Ani DiFranco
Label: Righteous Babe Records

. Rocks Like: Dar Williams; Tori Amos

Folk singers are notori—

 ous for their social‘com—
 mentary through highly
lyrical, self—written songs
that stir up emotions and

J . 

please the ear. /

Ani DiFranco is one such artist who
has released almost 20 albums in almost as
many years, and she hasn’t lost her social
and political edge yet. From sparse acoustic
solo work to fully orchestrated bombasts,
DiFranco’s work has long been centralized
on her words. Fittingly, then, observations
and opinions abound in her latest album,
Red Letfer Year.

\While her subjects ‘range from mother-
hood and relationships to religion and poli—
tics, DiFranco expresses herself - without
the feeling that she’s standing on a soap-
box. Her spokeﬁ word—like rhythmic vocals
would put anyipoet to shame, and her lyrics
always impress. T "

There is no subject that she can’t turn
into an intricate metaphor for life, love and
values. Ani DiFranco fully appreciates the
little things in “The Atom.” The song is a
tribute to the “smallest unit of matter unit-
ing bird and rock and tree and youand me.”
How she can turn a song about a unit of
matter into a statement about consumerism,
religion‘-and activism is incredible. The lyr—
ics set to simple guitar and sung with soft
vocals allow the listener to really hear" the
words of the song.

If there is anything you should take
away from listening to DiFranco, it ‘is’ that
she always has something to say. And that
something is usually worth listening to. Her
thought_s on everything from global and en-
vironmental issues to religion to her own
family and relationships are the creative fod-
der for her music.

The songs are deﬁnitely lyric—driven,
with each word evoking vivid images in the
listener’s mind. The diary—style thought ca~
tharsis that happens here gives substance to
the words DiFranco sings. There is personal
and passionate meaning in every verse.

The piano—accompanied “Smiling Un-
derneat ” uses strong imagery to show the
songwriter’s devotion to and contentment
with her companion. She says she doesn’t
mind all the unfortunate things in life if
she’s “with you.” Her idea of unfortunate
ranges from spilling hot sauce on her shirt

    
   

to delayed ﬂights to being stuck in traffic
with teething quintuplets to wearing a ﬂam-
ing Christmas wreath. Safe to say DiFranco
is pretty happy “with you.”

The vocals range from almost spoken '

words to appropriately subtle vocal expres-

A sion to a wordless instrumental. piece.

The heavy words DiFranco speaks do
well accompanied by instrumentals that
never overpower the vocals. The way she

expresses herself is reminiscent of a slam

poet in a crowded coffee shop whose words
are answered with a chorus of enthusias-

tic snaps. The rhythmic words fitperfectly
with the subject matter ——-— nothing gets your
point across like a rhythmic spotlight.

“Alla This” employs a semi—spoken vocal
style to great effect. Focus moves from the
words of staying true to self to the string
solo with hushed backing Vibraphone notes.
D_iFranco uses her band well, with lyrics tak-
ing a backseat to the instrumentals at inter-
vals that show the versatility of the outfit.

Despite the fact that “Red Letter Year
Reprise” has no lyrics, just a myriad of horn
instruments, the song burstsvwith expressive

feeling. It is difficult to get an inanimate ob- 

ject to emote, but DiFranco and her band
get it done. Never has a metallic object made

'audiences feel so joyful since the dance of

“The Brave Little Toaster.”
Expression is key for DiFranco. This

songwriter’s thoughts become more than A ..

just ﬂeeting ideas. A thought is a song and a
chance to" let the world know how she feels.

With so much to say, how can one not lis— '

ten to this ultra—cool activist, mother, singer
and, maybe most importantly, fellow human
being?

\When asked what he would do with the
prize money, Migliuolo responds, “You call it
a prize, I call it an investment.” l\/Iigliuolo has
plans to obtain FDA approval for the ma-
chine.

Dan McVeagh, another contestant, has cre-
ated the CompuTable, “a homemade 40-inch
multi—touchl display.” -

The device uses a wide variety of applica—

tions created by McVeagh, including a photo-
gallery and games.

“Unlike a computer, which can only re-
spond to one mouse click at a time, the Com-

*puTable can interact with 20 touches at once,”

he explained. McVeagh, a junior information
technology and management student at Point
Park University, started work on the table 

 of 2007. Nine months later, he hadhis .

ﬁrst prototype.
“I saw a video of Bill Gates using a touch
computer a few years ago. I knew that was the

ﬁiture. Then the fact that you could do it your-"
self really fueled the ﬁre,” said McVeagh. “Ever
since the iPod Touch, multi—touch has gotten

That was April of 2007. Just about a
year later, Reda launched his Web site,
theneoc_ube.com, selling the invention as

l the NeoCube Alpha for $59.95. Reda also

markets the 3~by—3—by—3 Neo Cube Mini
for $13.95. Also available is the “Cube—
Tastic Value Pack,” which contains both
the Neo Cube Alpha and the Neo Cube

.’ Mini for $44.95. He is currently holding a

sale, however, knocking $10 off the pric-
es of the Alpha and Cube—Tastic Value
Pack.

The ﬁrst month, Reda sold an under-
whelming grand total of two NeoCubes,
but after he released a series of YouTube
Videos showing off the possibilities of the

cube, “I sold over a thousand in two days,” ’

said Reda.

Simply put, the NeoCube is a fun little
toy. The trick to creating interesting shapes
is dividing the spheres into triangles of
nine. From here, triangles can easily con-
nect in two or three dimensions to create
geometrically sound shapes. You can cre-
ate a ball, a cone and, of course, a cube.
But there -are also a seemingly endless
number of other stimulating and unique
forms.

Mastering the cube deﬁnitely takes
some practice. It is very easy to accidently
get the magnets too close to one another
and have them connect, ruining the pre-
cise ﬁgure you were going for. The power
of the magnets is quite astonishing.

It is also quite satisfying to simply
break the pieces apart, mangle them back
together and do it all over again. 9

And Reda hopes that’s exactly what
you’ll do.

The Mitsch Report

fantasy

by Pat Mitsch
Se/zio/‘_ Sta]? I«VI‘[tcr

  

Before we get to any quirky news or jokes, I
need help. ' I

I have LenDale White on my fantasy team.
I didn’t want to take him in the first place, but I
didn’t have a choice. He was a fourt1'1—rounder
in a 20—team draft, and I had the 16th pick. I
took Mauiice JonesvDrew, followed by Steve
Smith. Ilhad my third-round pick  set up to
use on Matt Forte, until he was taken one pick
ahead of mine I

Shaken and deﬂated I took White, the best
running back available at the time, assuming
that he’d be the Titans’ primary and goalline
back in a run—heavy offense. He’s not the pri-
mary back anymore —— rookie Chris Johnson
is, and he is even getting some red—zone carries.
But White still seems to be the goalline back
and has five touchdowns to date — not a bad
count by any means. ‘ A

Here’s the rub, though. In this league, yards
are worth double what they are in normal
leagues, because it’s a 20—tearn league, and every
owner is forced to make several questionable
starts. With this in mind, touchdowns are only
worth as much as 30 rushing yards, as opposed
to 60, and aren’t at as much of a premium any-
more. , I

My question to anybody out there, because

a I am at a loss, is what should I do with LenDale

White? Keep him? Trade  Who can I get
forjhjm? Who is_going to want him? Help!

If you know a possible solution, skip right
to the end of this column, find my e—mail ad-
dress and let me know.

.White posing

dilemma

ESPN last week that he thinks the speculation
about LeBron James leaving Cleveland after his
contract expires in two years is an “insult to the
city.” An insult to Cleveland, huh? Didn’t know

' that was possible.

— Remember the TGIF television lineup in the
90s? Yup. It’s back and it’s louder than your
uncle’s black and gold Zubaz pants. The new
lineup? Check it out: ‘

— “2 Step by Step” (A reality series following the
disappearance of DJ. Unk, featuring T. Pain)

— “The North Hills” (Pending

- “Sabrina the Forgotten Celebrity? ’

— And a mega—hot new sizzler called “Presiden—
tial Debate.” '

Are you psyched? I’m psyched.

— And as a warm—up for Friday, the vice presi-

‘ dential debate between Sen. Joe Biden and

Gov. Sarah Palin is on tonight I know I’ll be
watching  the Pitt football game, that is.

- For the last time, I AM REGISTERED TO

— Well first the Steelers lost Willie Parker, now
Rashard Mendenhall. With Mewelde Moore
the only viable  back option, the Steel-
ers re—signed Najeh Davenport I would have
suggested a more “famous” replacement: As

ebrated at midﬁeld on the Cowboys’ star after

Pitt looks to pounce on

banged-up defensive line

Football,‘ page l8

Conversely, three Panthers have double-
digit receptions, and only 10 players have at

least one catch this year, albeit in one fewer
' game. '

0 Because of this, Wannstedt said he expects
Dom DeCicco and  Fields to play strong
safety tonight .

‘‘\X/e’ll play both of them,” said Wannstedt.
“When we get in our nickel package, both will
play together. When you look at South Florida,
they like to spread the ball with four or five
receivers.” - ‘ '

But the Bulls aren’t just superb offensively.’

They also have one of the top defenses in the
conference. ' A

South Florida is  up 16.8 points per

game, placing it third in the Big East, but is
first in total defense,  up 243.8 yards per
game. The Bulls ‘also feature the conferences
best rushing defense,  up a ininiscule
58.8 rushing yards  game, which is good
enough for fourth in the nation. , _
Much like tl1e Panthers, though, South
Florida hasn’t faced talent on the level it will
see ‘tonight, speciﬁcally tailbacks LeSean Mc-
Coy and LaRod Stephens-Howling. If the two
play the way they have the past few games, the

Panthers could be the first team to rush for  

as a contender for the Big East.

“With it  a Thursday night game in
front of a full house,"it; will be an exciting at- C

mosphere and our kids are looking forward to
it,” said Wannstedt. “We’re not where we need
to be, but we’re inching our way closer. We
haven’t gone backward,‘ so as long as we -keep
moving forward and keep a good attitude,
then I’ll be happy.” ’
