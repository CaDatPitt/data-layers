in the ordinary activities of University life, has been manifestly »im.possible.' This fact the faculty itself_..has
recognized. On the whole, boththe teaching. staff and the students are togbe fehcitated upon bringing the

year to a close as successfully as they have done. ‘v .

The enlistment of 653 students, of 129 members of the faculty and of 884 alumni "of the University, mak‘-’
ing a total, so far as the records indicate, of 1,666 "men, is an achievement‘ of which any institution of learn-»
ing may be proud. The fact that the University sent a Base Hos.pital"to France necessarily called upon the‘
Medical School to furnish a larger percentage of its faculty, am-ountingto. 4722 per cent‘. of thewholeifaculty.
The M-ediicall School -also furnishes» 31.6 per cent. of the enlisted alumni, of 1116 University. The Senior Class
of this School has in it 24 men--—all enlisted but one, who is over the draft age, A
School is, apart from the fact of the Base Hospital, ‘essentially equalled by that of the otherschools.

Moreover, it "is a source of satisfaction that the University has been able to offer direct war service
in special courses during the year, speciﬁcallyyin preparation. for enlarged‘ usefulness at -this time. These ‘
courseswhave been given‘ both to men and women, and it is the plan of the Trustees to enlarge this branch
of the service during the coming year. The Reserve Officers’ Training Corps has been established at the
University under the direction of Colonel  St-ickle. F-our OrdnanceA'Courses of ‘six weeks each were
given—-the last to a very large class. This Department has been transferred to Camp Hancock. The»Ul1l-
versity has already received 650 soldiers for instruction in gas engine, auto, mechanics, etc., and within a.
month or two after the close of the term, at least 1,100 soldiers. will be quartered on the Campus. Barracks
are already erected and occupied, and the capacity of these .will b-e trebled and, quadrupled as rapidly as
possible-A. A dining hall to seat 1,200 will be completed within a few days. ‘A A - - I '

Department to enlist young men -of eighteen years of age and send them back for their training in ’cheAUAni-

Corps has been established and was able to send.17 men to A the Officers’ .TrainAirig Camp at Battle Creek,.
‘Michigan, and 57 men to the Plattsburg Camp, opening on June 5th._ The" plan of the.

A ar Department is-
tohave the young men carry on their usual academic and technical work and at the same time receive
training in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, with the’ purpose of "enabling them to secure both their
degree and their ofﬁcer’s rank by the time the usual draft age is reached’. To accomplish this in the "Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, the Trustees have made permanent an eightweeks’ course inAthe su}nmer, so that ex-
cepting the months of June and September, the" University will be in continuous operation throughout the
year. In this way all diligent students can secure their degree and their oflicer’s rank inv_Military Science and

It is a possible patriotic service every. student of the University can render, to call the attention of
young men graduating‘ from the high school ,this year to the opportunity thus provided‘ forthem in the

University and in other institutions of learning in which the Reserve A-Qfﬁcers’ ‘Training ‘Corps is estab- 
lished. The greatest’ need of the Government is college and university train-ed. men, because it is out of .A..

these very largely ofﬁicers are to be made. Not for the sake of,.the University, not primarily for the? sake

LETTERS FROM A

ANDERSON IS  
IN ENGINEERS

A. K. Anderson, former Assistant
"Sports Editor of THE VWEECKLY,
manager of the Musical clubs, et-c.,
writes from Comrpany B, 601st En-
gineers, Ca-mp Glen Burnie, Md.,
April 30, as follows:

“I was transferred from the Infantry
to the Ezigineers two weeks ago. I am
Assistant Supply Clerk now and am’
looking for somethingbetter soon. It
is a pretty good job,'being clerical to a.
great extent and relieving you‘ from the
drill work. The regiment is making
preparations to leave for ‘over there,’
but I don't believe it will come for a.
month or so. I hope to get back for
Commencement, if I have to walk. I
miss the things at the University more
than anything else, I think, and though
I won't graduate it would mean a, great
deal to get back at that time. ,

“We were at Laurel, Md., for awhile,
but it was found too unhealthy, so we
pulled out for here under full packs,
and hiked 21 miles. Nice walk. While
at Laurel, I ran down one Sunday and
spent several pleasant hours with Capt.-
Dan Dickson and his wife. He has a.
nice place there, and a. mighty ﬁne wife.
It seemed great to talk to someone from
school. I haven't been getting THE
WEEKLY and sure do miss it. It is a
bond that holds.”

 

F REDEITE, ’l 4

Many P.ittite.s, especially the recent
medical -graduates, will be interested
in reading parts of letters written by
Dr. J. VV. Firedette, ’l4, to his father
and mot-her. Dr. Friedette ‘has "been
in the -thick of a-ction on the western
front. ,1 The first letter is dat-ed April
2, and is, in -part, as’ follows:

“As compensation for the delay in
writing you, I have two good items of
news. The first is self-evident——tha.t I
have come through the big stunt safely,
and .second, is that I have received an
order today to report to Base Hospital
No. 27 for duty. I am sure that cheers
you. . . »
“As for my experiences during the
last few weeks, I can’t go much into
detail, as it would take a. young volume
to tell you all about it. It was one. of
the greatest battles in history, and as
our division was immediately in front
of the heaviest concentration of the
Boche, I have a fairly good idea of
modern warfare. The division fought
wonderfully well for nine consecutive
days. Owing to the intense pressure
of the enemy we had to drop back grad-
ually, all the» time inflicting very heavy
casualties. Our casualties were, of
course, heavy, but only in proportion,
and not more than could be expected.
We killed two or three Boches for every
casualty we sustained.

“My experiences were very interesting

aged to get myself and wounded out of
one side of a village when the Boche
was coming in the other. '

“A big battle such as this is not with-
out its, discomforts, but nothing matters
as long as we continue to hold them.
It is just as well that I had a. little
reserve fat, because I lost some weight.
Am. as fit as a fiddle, however, and never
felt better in my life. ‘

“We are ’now miles back for a. much-

ever enjoyed a bed as much in my‘ life
as I did one last night. It was like
Paradise to get between those white
sheets and forget about war. I took
my clothes off for the first time in 12
days, and this afternoon I had a delight-
ful bath and a. change of clothes."

The next letter is dated April 14,
In which he tells -of his arrival at the
P1t=t Base Hospital No. 27, and --his
trip en route. He says, In part:

"Reached Base Hospital after a. four
days’ trip. Aside from the fact that
the station which I left was being
shelled, the journey was uneventful. I
spent about eight hours in Paris and
heard a. few of those shells from~the
long-range guns come in. The burst is
not very great, and the damage caused
is relatively small. Following our ﬁght
in the south, and after a rest of three
days’ duration, we were shoved north
just in time to come in the push up
there.‘ The ﬁght was just opening when
I left. It will be very interesting fol-
lowing the progress of the battle, for I
am quite familiar with the territory
over which it is being fought.

“The country here is delightful.
Trees and shrubs are all in leaf. Every-
one here is in good health and eager to
get to the front, but after eight months
of it I shall be quite content to settle
down for awhileand take things easy.
The hospital here is undoubtedly one of
the best in France, andcan accommo-
date 2,000 patients.

“You will be .interested to hear that
I am to be recommended for the Mill-
tary Cross, a1though_I will not know
for a. couple of months whether I shall
receive it. It was very kind of them
to mention me, and I must say that in
spite of all the hardships and’ discom-
forts which were unavoidable my time
with them was pleasantly and proﬁtably
spent." A

not as good as was hoped for but

The boys are off for their ﬁnal
meet of the year.

H=ere*s hoping they come across

 as they have done in the past.

The election of Frank Shea to cap-
tain the track team next year has
met with the hearty approval of "the
student «body. This boy surely de-
serves it.

Two Pitt men are,_en~tered in -the.
A. A. U. meet as ‘be held at Kenny-
wood tomorrow. Friedman, the star
of the Freshman team, will run the
200 and 220, put the shot and broad
jump. Peters is entered in the three
sprints.

 

Nothing to do now till next year.
W'hat joy; what bliss! '

This tcamghas also lowered the
University record for the mile relay
twice this year. At the Penn -relays
the team ran the relay in 3294-5
-both ‘times in lhejcollege champio-n--

later the mark was set at»3:282-S

apolis. Tlhis teami has ‘never met

other race of themseason at the Pitt
lnterclollegiatevs. I

The -great height to which the re-
lay team has climbed is due largely
to the wonderful running of Fbrank
Shea, the national quarter -mile
champion. His running at the Penn
relays under handicaps of 20 to 30
yards each race was the greatest Ibit
seen at Philadelphia for
some time. He runs a strong steady
race at allrtimes and never worries
He sh-as a
great stride that carries! him over
the ground at a fast clip.

The-other members of the track
team, Albright Peters,» S-peck and

well against some of the best runners
in college circles today. ‘Their work
has been greatly overshadowed by
