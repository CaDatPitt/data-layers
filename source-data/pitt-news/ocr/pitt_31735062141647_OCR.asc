J. T. Garver, head of the Work

 

:‘Training Division of the Western

Electric Company of Chicago, spoke
in the Heinz House. at noon Friday,
on “General Qualiﬁcations for Execu-
tive Work.” He emphasized the fact
that everyone has particular abilities
which make him good‘ in some lines
of work and.‘ poor in others, and that
everyone should analyze himself to
ﬁnd out where his ability lies. He di-
vided people into three classes: the
mechanical type, who» can do only
whatthey are told; those. who can
reason for themselves ?to. a certain
extent; and the executivetype, who
have. the initiative. to’ put things
through even in emergencies. for
which they have had no training. He
spoke of education as a box of tools
in the hands ofthe student, which
he shall use to make himself into a
certain type. of‘ person.
closed‘ his talk with‘ the. challenge,
“What are you going to do with your
education?”

WARNS FBOSH

The followingffis 3. letter that The
Pitt Week-ly received ‘from: the Soph-
omore wrecking crew: ‘
Dear Editor——- . _

This is for the beneﬁt of the
Frosh! We, the members of the
Sophomore and upper classes have
treated the Fresh as gentlemen, but
they have acted like cattle. We
have borne with the greatest pa-
tience and have endured to. the limit
the many disobedient Frosh who ap-‘
pear daily, on the cam-pus. We have
expected that the Freshman Class
would _consider the honor of their
position and conduct themselves ac-
cordingly. ln-stead of this they have
defaced our campus with unsightly
numerals. They ‘have been discov-
ered on numerous ~occ-lasions-. inciting
rebellion among themselves, against
the traditional laws of the Soph.o-
mores; They‘ have utterly disregard-
ed the commanddnent “Thou shalt
not smoke.” And horrors of hor-
rors a Fresh, by name, J. ‘W. Pincus
hath, encircled a fair co-ed with lov-
ing arms upon the battlements of
«State Hall. In considering all of
these’ numerous offenses the Class

of *25 has dealt with the offenders, 7

with the greatest leniency, trusting
that our Christian example will lead
them into the proper paths of con-
duct. All of our efforts have been
unavailing. Be it known to all Frosh
that the accumulated wrath and ven-
geance of the Sophomores is about
to descend! on their heads with a
hitherto unequalled. A
word of warning to the wise is suf-
ﬁcient. Therefore take heed.

to Engineering students. The lecture
will be held in the Fellows Room of

has very poor material there and can
hardly be expected to win many

Dr. Fred E. Henry came over from

A. R. “A1f” Hamilton was down
with a party. of .a dozen, including

with the game even if we did only

‘logical department of the Texas Com-
pany. Troxell says: ‘ -

“There are quite a few. Pitt men
here in Tulsa, and. we feel a. lot bet-
ter since the.-team has «started to
chalk up victories. I saw the Nebras-
ka-Oklahoma’ game, which Nebraska
won 39-7. Nebraska does not look’
quite so good as_t_hey did at Forbes

is the greatest team in the country.
Ihope Syracuse beats them.”

lonna had .not‘ had even one chance
to carry the ball, as he did not play
during the ﬁrst half and he hurt his
elbow while "giving interference to
Flanagan Awho was receiving the open-
ing kickoff of the half. ‘ -

It required only a few minutes for
Pitt to score its ﬁrst touchdown._ Pitt
received the kickoff and punted after
a few plays. A few‘moments later
‘Penn punted also and the ball was
now on Penn’s 42-yard line.‘ From
‘here *Pit_t__cAa_rried_ the ball over the
PennTgo‘a.lA’ line in several plays, An-

A derson’s.lorig.—A.run ‘was responsible for
— -Pitt's 1getting.- close wto-.Penh’s. goal.

A'ndy’s run wgasaon‘ the ﬁrst ‘play. He
was tackledon Penn's 11-yatrdline by
McGraw of Penn.. ‘Hewitt and An-
derson made eight yards between
them. ‘Then Hewitt was given the
ball and he responded forabout a yard
and a half.‘ He was given the ball
and this time he advanced it to the
one foot line. But it was ﬁrst down
for Pitt and only a foot to make in
four downs. However, Pitt was not
forced to use all these downs, for on
the ' ﬁrst Hewitt smashed through
Penn’_s.li‘ae for the ﬁrst score of the
day. Williams kicked successfully
from placement and the score was 7-0
in Pitt's favor. '

Pitt advanced the ball near Penn’s
goal before the half closed, but Wil-
liams’ try for a goal from the ﬁeld
was unsuccessful. Penn. came into
Pitt's territory, but Pitt's strong de-
fense and severalxpenalties inﬁicted
.upon' Penn prevented the home team
from becoming" dangerous.

Penn’s chances of‘ scoring seemed _-
remote until Hamer"of'Penn intercept-

ed. a forward pass on Pitt's 41' yard
line. At this stage Sullivan was rein-
jected into the game. He was given
the ball on the ﬁrst play but Sack

the next play, he made his run which
resulted in Penn’s’ touchdown. Ham-
er’s kick from "placement was blocked
by “Fats” Gourley and_ the score re-
mained with a one point advantage for
the Panthers. ‘

-Penn had no more Aopportunities to
score, but Pitt had several. 2 Twice
"Penn took the ball away from Pitt on
‘do'wn_s' near“theirA ten-yard line, and
'once Penn was given the ball on its
20-yard line after a forward pass was
thrown over their goal line.

Dear Ma and Pop:-‘ . _ -

Well folks I will surprise you. You
‘know we played -Penn at Philadelphia
and I and a lot of other"fel1ows hiked
down to see the game.‘ With the aid
of three_Fords and a Marmon we ar-
rived in plenty of time to see the
game. A lot of folks yelled at us on

 

 

to join the Navy lost" to Penn. and’
I. says to them you cant fool a Pan-
the!‘ fly and they laughed and we
did show the 2. smart alexs up. The
game was a peach we had the advan-
tage all the time and if the hick ref-
erees hadn’t cheated we would have
beaten them’ by a bigger score, Somg
wise cracken.fellows was in our gang."
{When we was close to the goal, once
a fellow yells out that they should
make a natural.‘ ’-I-Ie meant the seven
like in crap. Another guy who was

V yellin a lot said that he skinned his

Adam's apple.‘ A guy says Iwhopee to
kiss your nose We’ll win and when
the lines piled up once the same com-
medean says why dont you play foot-
ball instead of London bridges. I
agree-dwith one fellow that the team
belonged in the Penn, Well they sure
did see Pittsburgh smoke when "our
boys played one fellow says to
other Whats the answer Mr. Gallagher
‘and. he says. _beat.W and J Mr. Sheen’
but that wasnt_ their names so I saw
nothing funnyin that. A Some .fo:llow
‘says to me if I wanted to bet some
money on "the game ‘with good odds‘
and says I was sure to win and I says

I had of bet what I could I would have
had money to come back in a train in-

stead of the truck that took me. ’

Alls’ well until the next time.-

Yours for study, _

THE HONOR‘ svs-rem sAvEo

 

That ‘students of Reserve have giv-
en proof of their ﬁtness to be ruled
by the honor -system seems to have

-been prove‘d'beyond_ all question by

their_ conduct during the recent ex-
amination period, Though there is
still- room’. for improvement, but if
future examinations are as free-from
honor systemviolations as the last
one, there will be no need to even
think of a return to the antiquated
proctor system." , . .

In a time when the violation and
the contempt for law and order is
as ﬂagrant as it is at the present
in the Ihiited States, the decidedly
successful carrying out of the spirit
and letter of the honor system is
more than satisfactory. _

"It has been stated,'though without
full" authority, that the number of
failures was -unusually high‘ this
year. If that is the case, it can: be
sincerely said that is is far better
to fail honorably than to ‘succeed

dishonstly.. Of course the more ef-

ficient working of the honor system

may‘ have had little or nothing to,

do with the number of failures, but
it would i_1e..no more than ‘reasonable
to believe that it was in a‘ large
part responsible. - , V i ;

A properly educated business man
should know more than the mere
fundamentals of business ‘adminis-
tration. He should be‘ able to speak
intelligently on a variety of topics.
He should be fa/miliariwith science
and literature and hi-story. ‘He should
know not only how a corporation
is formed, and the sales functions
‘of a business letter, or advertise-
ment; he should know that Shake-
speare lived in the sixteenth, and-
not in the twentieth century,‘ and
that Napoleon. was a general and not
merely a kind of French pastry.

Students of advertising, salesman-
ship and journalism especially should
be given the opportunity ‘for ab-
sorbing "a certain quantity of clas-
sical knowledge. A salesman must
know not only the fundamental re-
quisites of selling. In addition, it is
essential that he be a_Jb.le to speak
interestingly and intelligently on di-
verse subjects.

Besides knowing‘ the particular ad-
vantages, and perhaps disadvantages,
of _his product, he should know some-
thing of ‘art, literature and science.
The hobby of’ the man to whom he

one of these. .

In the very nature of things, the
newspaperman must be familiar with
a vast quantity of cultural»-knowb
edge. ‘Here,’ such knowledge is
much more important than knowledge
of- a strictly commercial nature.

Even the prospective ﬁnancier "or

accountant. should know more than
the mere- technical, business funda-
mentals of his occupation.
_To_ form a foundation for the fu-
ture strictly professional work of
business students, provision should
be made for one or _two years pre-
preparatory college training. This is
the only way inwhich the need for
such basic and essential knowledge
can be met.—N. Y. U. News.

TAKE AN INVENTORY

 

Mid semester exams are rapidly ap-
proaching and this means that the

mester. Have we availed ourselves
of our time? ~What have we accom-
plished? . .

Every good business man ‘takes an
inventory pe-riodically, and thus he is
"/able to check up on his stock. By
closing his books at the end of the
period, the business man is able to,
ascertain whether he , has made a
proﬁt or suffered a‘-loss. ‘

Students should likewise take an
inventory of themselves.
their assets? What are their liabili-
ties? Has the student gained or has
he suffered alos-s3? ' A . -_

If the student. ‘has proﬁtably in-
vested his time, has ‘attended classes
and studied, he is bound to ﬁnd his
-balance on the right side-—a proﬁt.
But on the contrary, the student who
squandered his time, cuts ' classes
and thinks only of pleasure, forget-
ting his studies, this student will
ﬁnd a debit. =bala_ncei——-a loss.

‘By building up those things which

" RESPECT UPPER-GLASSIM EN

 

Some people have to make an ob-
vious effort to be polite and respect-

-ful; there are some who simply do
not give consideration _to anyone at
any time; and there are others to
whom it “-comes natural” to give re-
spect wherever due. Those of the
first order have one manner for the
lesser lights,’ and another for folks
of importance. The second type care
only for themselves. But the third
sort of human being—a' sort univer-
sally be1oved—h‘as‘only to appear to
make a friend. The genuineness of
a benign sincerity and respect is; felt
at once: ‘ 4

But it is not always easy -in rain
or‘ shine, through thick and thin, to
smile and be gentle and keep .one’s
temper. This radiant‘ politeness--re
spectfulness——that wins all hearts im-
mediately, is -born of '.goodness_ that
has patiently schooled itself, and’ has
known the thorns -as well as the
petals of the Maytime roses... There
was practice that created the amia-

quisite sound of singing orthe violin,
that seems ‘a purely .-spontaneous wrap-
ture, there had to -be practice, and
there were long stiff sessions of tech-
nical exercises. ‘ -~ ..

W"el~«bring this out by wa.y of an
introduction. to a matter of utmost
importance: to the student .body as a

position in -college-life. Theattitude
assumed by the under-classmen here
toward‘ the metn. of Senio-r rank is

is apparentlyino difference»; absolute-\
ly no honor in being -a Senior. We

bear this out. .How such a feeling
‘has come about we cannot deﬁnitely
say;fbut it is obvious that the pres-
cntstaie of affairs must ;be correct-
ed. if a high -morale is» to be main-
tained at Springﬁeld-. Seniors should
have precedent; should be respected
by all men of.-lowerlclasses. In or-
der to bringa-bout the proper feel-
‘i-ng, the»under-classmen must begin
acquiring the respect that “-conic-s
natural,” keeping in mind that they.
‘too, in time, will be respected in
like manner. _We might add, not
without cause, that theg Seniors
should carry_ themselves in such a
way as to demand» respect.—Spring-
ﬁeld Student. '

man, you would ﬁnd ,that social func-
tions are -part of his career.. ‘ It is
these occasions ’ that serve to
strengthen butsiness acquaintances,
and due to this personal touch- very
close friendship-s'are developed‘. And
what does true friendship in business
mean?‘ It can always. be classed as a
very valuable asset. V’ ‘

You ex-service men know‘ above
others» the real meaning of fraternal
relations. Who was a-truer fratern-
ity brother than -your ’-buddy? Make
;up ,your mind "that you will devote
some time in promoting ..these pro-
jects which are- offered you._ If no-
tice of a dance is given, if a class
meeting is held, or some social ‘func-
tion, do your “darndest” to ‘attend.
It ‘is ‘in this way that you can keep
in touch with your classmates in a
social way, as well as through school
work. Associations in this manner
will cement friendship ne’er to be for-
gott'en.——-Temple U-niversityi Weekly.

“The world pride is a. big one, es-

that a soldier, lacking in it can, not

Take the soldier who is neat, clean

you have a; man ‘who, due to his ‘ap-

, pearance, everything else being nor-

to which he belongs. At the same
time, if other things are ‘not normal;

cent language, he is a credit to_the
service. just so long as he keeps, his
mouth closed» and, no longer. But
persons who take pride in personal

seek ‘to avoid doing or‘ saying any-
thing, not.in harmony with the im-
pression made by their appearance.

make the best possible impre-ssion,
canbe relied upon to doﬁis share of

 innate sense of pride plays ‘a
part in the life of man that will

in order to prevent the possibility of

‘being ace-“used, of doing or saying
anything adverse to his nature.

SILENT MEN

In this world of ours we always
ﬁnd a number of self-consciof1s,,and
‘They are of the
type who, on public occasions, prefer
to remain in the balckground.

est and the position of silent-observer
suits them perfectly, as does-the last]
place at the table. They are never
heard of as battling for the Pinnacle,
or for glory, and often times absent
themselves from -showy occasions in
fear that the vonlooker may construe
‘which a lot of folks strive for-—
“limerlight.” ,_ h

On the other hand, these folks, al-
thoughias sileg. as the Sphinx, as
shy‘ as the squrrels, and - a.s back-

'flrs.t public recitation in school, are
generally the silent workers who
accomplish things. Their voices are
very seldom heard, but their achieve-
ments speak for them. -*

Of course, we are not criticising
those who do talk. It would '-be a
ﬁne‘ banquet without speakers, and a
ﬁne school with mute teachers, and
what a talking machine with blank
records. No! No!" Far be it from
such! We simply have to have talk-
"ing, and lots of it in order to ac-
complish things. And yet, We must
have action at the same time.

You silent. men should associate
Nlourselvesa with a "little more social
work around school. Of course. your
studies may occupy a considerable-
portion of,‘ your time -and ‘keep’ you

ger. But pride keeps the man at
his po-st. The soldier who would
give his country the best in him is
the one who p1'es~erves himself in
every way -when there is no need. to
do otherwise. If he has pride in
‘the service, his organization and. in
his continued existence, he will do
all manner of things in keeping
therewith. .

Prode, without a doubt, makes the
brave soldier. Put it islack-of judg-
ment that causes the man to per-
form gfool-hardy and braggadocio acts
of miscalled valor. , The" impulsive
man, intoxicated with a desire to do
something spectacular, is a danger-
ous element to his organization, be-
cause he may ,co:mmit it to action
at" an inoppo~rtune":time, or he may
withdraw under stress of excitement

An English brigadier general, while
addressing‘. the «officers of the 325th
Infantry during the World War,’ said:
“The brave: man lasts only ‘a short
time, in battle and destroys very few
of the enemy. A soldier lasts a
longer time and destroys many of
the enemy.” ’
The Gene1'a.l_ meant to and‘ did con-

AN AMERICAN TNEEDA

 

. The great American need is for a
vision of-a larger .lifc- and its possi-
lbilities. ’Our vision is limited, our

aspirations are limited, and there..-
‘ fore our possibilities are limited.
Our vision is limited because we lack
a cle.fln'i_te "aim. a deﬁnite ambition, a
deﬁnite purpose.

.Rapidly rather than .effi-cien"cy, is
the watchword of
youth.
~p~hi1osop‘hy. He has practically no
vision of the future. He is not
thinking what he may be
twenty-ﬁve years from now. He has
.a. $75—or a $100-—a‘ month ambition
‘He therefore gets an education no
lbetlor than his ambition. If he had
a $3,000—-or a $5,000—a year ambi-
tion. he would get an education to ﬁt
it, and then he would prepare to
solve some of life's problems.

People often wonder why they
are not more successful. The an-
swer is usually that they are not ﬁt-

for their occupations.

The person without an ultimate
aimis mere putty ready to be shaped‘
and molded by every passing whim.
"But the individual with 9., deﬁnite
purpose is one with a -conquering
spirit. He is a leader of men and
amolder of environment. He sets

the way.  knows which way he
is traveling, andwhy, because he
has a, vision.

Many people ‘go through life: with-
-out knowing. what it is to live. Un-
less we are living for something and
know what it is; unless we are mak-
ing the’ most of every talent with
which a, kind Providence has e-n-
dowed us; unless we are developing
every day. by‘ the exercise. of these
talents; unless we aiegratlually but
unceasingly ' broadening, expanding,
achieving better and
greater and greater results, as the
days and weeks and months go by‘;
unless we are doing" a.ll these things

the Ronald Press of New York City,
and former‘ head of the Management
Department of New York University
School ‘of Commerce, addressed ‘the
School of Economics assembly last
Vvednesday on the question, “What
Are You Here For?” »
,According "to Mr. -Galloway ther
would. be three types of answers
given to that question. "Student No.
1,” he said,‘ “would reply that it
never occurred to him. Student No
2 would! say that he could not ﬁnd
any answer to it. Student No. '3
would say, in effect, that he was
here to adjust himself to his environ.-
‘ment after he gets out of college."

“Student No. 1 is usually ranking
-high in marks. Inlater life he will
have a. good job’ and will be running
a little car and have a pretty good
home. He is‘ usually interested in
art, literature and travel. Generally,
he is; a highly respected man and
highly efficient. .'

“-Student No. 2. has an inquisitive
type of mind,'but no concentration
His work. in college is ordinarily
about the average, but he would hold
no adn1inistrative- position in stu-
dent activities, which hold excellent
opportunities for « training. Student
No. 2 is socially popular, but has no
sound. convictions. After college life
he will probably get a, job from his
father or some other relative, and
will usually have at least two posi-
tions during the ﬁrst year. At the
end.‘ of tenlyears he will -be in sub-
stantially the sameposition. .He is,
according to. Mr. Galloway, an eco-
nomic ﬂoater and an _ economic
menace. ‘ ' .

“Student No. 3 is usually an aver-
age student, but ranks high in one
-particular ﬁeld. He is interested in
some ﬁnancial committee in «college
or other activity. He is often mak-
ing part or all of his college expen-
ses, and is not particular -as to the
nature of his outside work; After
college he will usually take a posi-
tion offering .low ’compensation, but‘ at
the end of ten years he will be high-
er than either No. 1 or No. 2. i

“No. 1.’ is preparing for mastery;
No. 3 is preparing for leadership
through mastery, and No. 2 is of no
consequencc,”; said Mr. Galloway.

Speaking further Mr. Galloway
stated: that “business is divided into
two general groups, the operating
section and the; policy determining
section.‘ The former group consists
of such positions as advertising man-
ager,‘ sales manager, purchasing
agent, _a-ocountant, ‘etc. The» latter
group consists .of the higher exec-

Mr. Gallofhy advised three rules

graduation'.- “First,” he said, “ﬁnd a.

Cubs Stage Comeback r After
Bellefonte Scores in Second
Quarter--- Bellefonte Offers
S t u bb or n Resistance ‘~'-to
Panther Attack

 

—'l‘he Freshman‘ gridiron players
‘staged a comeback at Bellefontex by

' defeating the Academy boys 10-6. The

team showed better form during this
contest than they have displayed this
season.’ Owing to the fact that the
prep school students were anxious to

see the Penn State-Carnegie Tech
game that was being played at State
College, the game-..w'as played on Fri-
day afternoon "instead of’ Saturday
afternoon as -was the original date
scheduled. This advancement did not
disappoint the Cub athletes as_ they
were thus given a chance to go to
Philadelphia to witness the varsit
clash with old Penn. _ -
It was athot and bitter contest, as
is shown by the fact that the Belle-
fonte boys held the .Cubs scoreless
during the whole ﬁrst half of the
g_ame. The last half of the contest
proved the superiority of the Fresh
over their prep school ‘opponents.
Tiny Lynn, the small tackle of the
Prep boys made numerous holes in the
Panther line and during the second
quarter, Hill, fullback t.ook advantage

of the ﬁne holes made for him, and; ‘

plunged for the ﬁrst’ and only touch-

. down of the gamefor Bellefonte. This

did not discourage the players’ from
Pittsburgh, and they began a deter-
mined ﬁght_to the goal line and vic-
tory. 7 A V ‘

The touchdown

was _scored by

straight football tactics in marching‘

straight down the ﬁeld towards Belle-
fonte’s goal by downs. After the
kickoff following the touchdown and
point from goal, the Yearlings got 3.
ﬁne start once more and pranced the,
pigskin right down to their enemy’s
20-yard line and here the Freshies
kicked a goal from the ﬁeld, boosting
the total to ten. The last quarter
was taken care of mostly by punting
from one side to the other, but the
Prep players gave the Cubs a scare

when Blackman got away with a for-

ward pass from _Hill for a_ .40-yard
gains Schmidt, Lalielle, Archibald,

-and Blackburn played best for the

Bellefonte boys, while Harding, Gus-
tafson, and Chase played stellar ball

for the Pittsburgh players.

The real strength of the Cubs will.
be exercised next Saturday when they
meet the Kiski Prep team at Forbes
Field, preliminary to the Washington
and Jefferson-Pitt contest. The Kiski
boys .have been displaying real skill

_.in handling the oval this year, and

the yearlings must be at top notch
formto carry off the victory in this
game. All Freshmen are to report at
the game in their regulation “dinks”
at one o’clock ‘to see their team tan-
gle with the visitors from Kiski.
