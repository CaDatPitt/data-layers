en panels from the English House

‘of Commons. The panels, pre-

sented by the late Lord Alfred
,Bossom, will be on display.

The construction of the Eng-
lish Room was made possible by
a grant from the A. W. Mellon
Educational and Charitable Trust
as a tribute to the late Andrew
William Mellon, a United States
Ambassador to the Court of St.
James from 1-932-1933.

-J The wall-panelling, ﬁreplace,

hearth tiles, and door frame of
the English Room were. rescued
from the bomb-damaged House

took his appointment in April,
1965. He will be accompanied by
Lady Dean.

A reception in the Chancellor's
Office will be held following the
ceremony.

GOMIVIUTHS
Freshman commuters who re-
ceived questionnaires from the

pilot study to form a Commu- ‘

ter Assogiation are requested
to return them to the. boxes in
the Student Union, Engineering
Hall, or to mail them to Roy
Meckler, 907 Tower A.

It is important to the study
that everyone receiving these
forms return them. since the
response will determine wheth-
er the association will be form-
ed. .

Any commuters who are in-
terested in working on the as-
sociation should contact Linda.

Steinberg To Be Honored
At Honors Convocation

By ALEX D’IPPOLITO
Dr. William Steinberg,
music director of the Pitts-
burgh’ Symphony Orchestra,
will be awarded an honorary

Doctor of Humanities degree
at the annual Honors Convoca-
tion on March 16 at 8:30 p.m. in
the Syria Mosque. In lieu of the
traditional Convocation address,
a special group from the sym-
phony, conducted by assistant
conductor Ronald Ondrejka, will
perform. All University classes
after 8 p.m. are cancelled.

The Convocation will honor ap-
proximately 500 University hon-
or students and 20 University
Scholars. An honor student is an
individual “whose scholarship on
a cumulative basis meets the stan-
dard for graduation with honor
in that school.“ Quality Point
Average (QPA) requirements may
vary from school to school. E
University Scholar is a student
who has earned“ two perfect 4.0
QPA’s in a row or one 4.0 QPA
if a freshman.

The degree will be presented
by H. J. Heinz II, vice—president
of the Pittsburgh Symphony So-.
ciety. Prior to the Convocation
the society is holding a banquet
in Dr. Steinberg’s honor.

Dr. ' Steinberg was chosen for
the honorary degree “in recogni-
tion of his contribution to Pitts»-
burgh and to music,” said Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs
Helen P. Rush in announcing the
award. “The University is re-
lated to the cultural opportun-
ities of Pittsburgh. We are for-
tunate in having one of the great
symphonies at our back door,”
she said. .

The format of the Convocation
was changed from the usual
morning program with a formal
speech to the new program to
give the evening students in the
School of General Studies an op-

portunity to attend a Convoca-
tion and to add variety to the pro-
gram, said Vice-Chancellor Rush.

This type of Convocation is
“one of the finest ways of rec-
ognizing scholars and the kind
of thing they would respond to,”
she said. '

Dr. Steinberg, who recently
signed a new three year contract
with the Pittsburgh Symphony,
was born into a music-loving fam-
ily in Cologne, Germany. By the
time he was ﬁve years/old he.
was an accomplished violinist
and within the next ten years
had established himself as pian-
ist and a conductor.

His talents on the podium took
him to Frankfurt, Prague,_ ‘Ber-
lin and other music centers. In
1937, he came to the United
States to ‘accept the position of

were D3111‘-

associate conductor of the NBC
Symphony Orchestra. Arturo Tos-
canini, the famed director of the
orchestra, had personally extend-
ed the invitation to Dr. Stein-
berg.

Dr. Steinberg cecame an Amer-
ican citizen in 1940.

After several seasons with the
NBC Symphony, he toured the
United States appearing as a
guest conductor. He then went to
Buffalo, N. Y., to, conduct its
Philharmonic orchestra. In 1952,
he was called from Buﬁalo to be-
come music director of the Pitts-
burgh Symphony.

During the 1964-65 season Dr.
Steinberg was granted a leave of
absence to conduct the New York

Philharmonic for 12 weeks. He .

also appeared at the Metropolitan
Opera.

In 1965, Dr. Steinberg was se-
lected “Man of the Year”..by the
Pittsburgh Junior Chamber of
Commerce.

ident Jerry Hogan and Associated
Women Students Vice-President
Janet Berson served on the ten

Owls on Sale

At Low Cost

This is the ﬁnal week that stu-
dents will have the opportunity
to save $4 on the purchase of the
1966 Owl, the school yearbook,
according to Owl Editor Diane
Ruppen. After this week the
price will be $10.

Roy Meckler, Owl publicity di-
rector, emphasized that the 1966
Owl is designed for all students
and not just the seniors. Another

departure’ from the usual form   

will be the introductory essay,
which will be more of a criti-
que of the past year.

The central theme of this year's
Owl, “Student Activism at the
University,” will be highlighted
by color photographs. They will
accompany black and white pic-
tures and a detailed evaluation
of the main theme.

:Boy and Girl ‘Find Computor Concurs
With Them on Their Dating Practices

By NANCY FUCHS
Mother Nature has been receiving consider-
able competition lately from the Computer-—-via
Operation Match. However, sometimes the Com-

1. puter conﬁrms her judgment as in the case of

two freshmen matched in the Operation.
Penny Frederickson and Tom Cahalan had

 started dating a few weeks before they ﬁlled out

the Operation Match questionnaires. Neither knew

 that the other had decided to participate in Match.

' Miss Frederickson, who entered on a bet, was
I’ amazed when she found Caha1an’s name on her
list. She said: “I couldn't believe it. I thought he
cheated.” Cahalan quipped: “I didn’t think a com-

 puter knew as much as I know.”

Miss/Frederickson, a liberal arts student, and
Cahalan, an industrial engineering student and

 member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity, have dis-

covered many interests in common, among them

I I swimming and traveling. .

' Another successful match, one which Opera»-
tion Match began; is that of Barbara West. a

‘ sophomore pre-dental student, and Bob Prehatney,
, -aI freshman in dental school.

Prehatney was intrigued with the “idea of
seeing what kind of girl I was supposed to be
compatible with." He was looking for a girl in-
terested in art. Miss West explained that she
“dabbles a lot in art.” Both are also interested in
dentistry, horseback riding, tennis, and skiing.

Meanwhile a girl that Prehatney was dating
when he ﬁlled out the questionnaire was paired
with his best friend.

“Operation Match is here to stay.” according

' to Mike Ranck, ‘ co-ordinator for the operation at
‘ the University. It has been so successful in the

past that it will be continued and even extended
to the (international level.

Operation Match will soon match up Ameri-
can students who are going abroad. In this way,

Ranck said, students can not only meet their
countrymenin a foreign nation on the basis of
the same background and language, but on com-
mon interests. -

Some 100,000 students have participated in
Operation Match thus far. Over 1,000 University
students took part last term, when Student Gov-
ernment sponsored it. However, this number was
“below the national average for the number of
questionnaires distributed on campus," according
to Ranck. ’

The initial distribution of the. second round of
Operation Match begins today. Two more distribu-
tions will follow later. The questionnaires will be
available at student desks in the Cathedral and
the Student Union and in the dormitories. Each
student is guaranteed at least ﬁve names.

Ranck explained that “The better the response
the better chance you’ll have of ﬁnding someone
with whom you’ll be compatible.” He recom-
mended that students planning to work in an
unfamiliar area this summer specify that they
would like to" matched up with someone from
that area.

This will be possible because Operation Match
is nationwide for the ﬁrst time. Other changes
include improvement in the questionnaire and a
better computer at the Harvard Computer Cen-
ter to which all questionnaires are sent.

In_ spite of the popularity of Operation Match
there is still some dissent as to the ‘success of
computer-matchmaking. In the Feb. 22 issue of
Look magazine, Dr. Morris S. Davis, astronomer
and director of the Yale Computer Center, is
quoted as saying: “Until body chemistry can be

imputed into the computer to stimulate the actual ’

reactions of two persons, I have my doubt con-
cerning the efficiency of the method." Regardless
of such doubts, thousands of college students are
having fun trying to make it work.

The delighted cries of little
children and the incessant patter
of 32 feet recently ﬁlled every
corner of a University fraternity
house. Phi Gamma Delta (Figis)
fraternity, in conjunction" with
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority,
was giving the underpriviledged
occupants of the Ward Home for
Children a Va_lentine’s Day party.

Conspicuously absent from the
party were the characteristic re-
freshments and entertainments
of a fraternity party. Rather, the
children joined in singing with
the Figis and Kappas and re-
ceived gifts for their efforts. Fur-
ther gaiety was provided by two
Kappas dressed as clowns. ,

For two of the children, the
party was an extra special occa-
sion. The two, a ﬁve-year-old

girl and an eight year-old-boy, 
are sister and brother, and the V‘

party was_one of the few occa-
sions on which they see one'*an-
other, despite the fact that they
live in the same home.

The -purpose of the project
was to promote a “stronger tie
between sororities and fraterni-
ties working on campus for a
good’ cause.”

By SUZAN and JOSEPH DIVACK
Speaking on Determinism and
lndeterminism, Father Ernan Mc-
Mullin of Notre Dame delivered
the second of the week's two lec-
tures in the Philosophy of Sci-
ence lecture series Tuesday night. .
His approach was almost com-
pletely non-technical in contrast
to Dr. 0. Costa de Beauregard’s
lecture, Monday night.
Professor McMullin began with
a brief history of the term “de-
terminism,” distinguishing three
separate meanings. The core
meaning is to “mark off boun-
daries or set limits.” However, in
the history of science and philo-
sophy, determinism has come to
mean something like universal
predictability. The speaker was
careful to sift out problems of
free will and moral determinism
from the scientiﬁc determination
under discussion. ‘ .
Next, Father McMullin picked
up the thread of determinism in
17th century mechanics, the
world machine of Descartes and
Newton. The determinism of this

. age took the form of mechanism,

which assumes all causal inter-
action to be mechanical. Accord-
ing to Father McMullin, the sci-

/ence of the Renaissance made

the fundamental error of confus-
ing the conceptual structure of
their theories of mathematical

. . physics with the structure ofthe

physical world. Newtonian de-

terminism is conceptual; it in-‘

volves predictability and retro-

'dictability from descriptions of

initial states.

Father McMullin came to the
heart of his topic when he pro-
ceeded to lay out three stages
of the introduction of indetermin-
ism into physics. Stage one in-
volved the introduction of statis-
tical methods into thermodynam-
ics and mechanics in the mid-19th

century. This seemed to be only a I

convenience because of the diffi-

culty in dealing with large num-

bers of Newtonian‘ particles.
Predictions,‘ however, did be-

Trivia Quiz.

 The Special Interests Commit-

tee of the Student Union Board
is presenting a Trivia Contest

' this Thursday. It will be held in

the Student Union Lower Lounge
at 7 p.m. .

The contest is ‘calculated to
provide an escape into the se-
curity of trivia for those who are
encumbered by the painful ac-
curacy required in their couses.

In a massive free-for-all,’ stu-
dents will ask trival questions of

.'I  _
 the audience members. For ex-

ample, a question might be raised
as to the full name of the Lone
Ranger’s horse or the formula
for a standard ‘deviation.

Questions will be collected in
advance via boxes in the Towers
Lobby and in .front of the. Stu-
dent»Union Desk.

« Prizes will be awarded to those
who submit the most trivial ques-
tions and to the person who is
able to answer the most of them.

Chaotically trivial refreshments

,y will be served in keeping with

the tone of the meeting.

 I Nomihame rather. Exph
“Determinism and Indeterminism”

come probabilistic. Stage two be-
gan in the very early 20th cen-
tury with the old quantum theory
of Planck and Einstein. This pos-
tulated a restricted uncertainty
principle for certain conjugate
properties such as position and

- momentum which placed a limit

on the ﬁneness of observation be-
cause of the properties of radia-
tion.

The basic idea here is interfer-
ence, and the uncertainty is in-
dependent of the object meas-
ured. According to this principle
the exact state descriptions ne-
cessary for Newtonian determin-
ism are impossible. ,

Stage three is the generalized
uncertainty principle, which rests
on a more sophisticated base than
stage two‘. A suggestion. made by
Dirac was picked up by Werner
‘Heisenberg and elucidated in a
famous paper. The new physics
of de Broglie had shown that ma-
terial objects have wave aspects,
and thus cannot be described as
classical particles, We must of
necessity use the mathematics of
noncommutative operators.

Given this mathematics, we can-
not by deﬁnition assign simul-
taneous sharp values of conju-
gate properties to the object
measured. The general uncertain-
ty principle limits predictions
which can be made given a quan-
tum mechanical state descrip-_
tion. Therefore, quantum me-
chanics is radically indeterminist
in a new sense.

Although the triumphs of quan-
tum theory are well known in
modern science, theoreticians dis-
agree over the correct interpreta-
tion of this indeterminism. The
Copenhagen school claims that
the uncertainty relations are an
intrinsic feature of physical~real-
ity. Planck and Einstein felt, and’
many Marxist scientists agree‘
that is not the last word.

Father McMullin noted that the

‘North found employment in

Music and Metamorphosis

Such a revolution has affected everyone here this year from the area

, of student affairs to the comptroller’s office. It is a change in the philoso-
phy of education which many claim is the heart of the state-affiliation
question. Honors Convocation offers an opportunity tohave an outside,
competent person speak on the issue, allowing the honored audience to
relate the complexities of the general revolution in education to the situa-

Dr. Steinberg and the symphony could also be included on such a pro-
gram, giving a program which would be certain to increase both the quality

of" the convocation and the attendance.

But, such is not the case. The University must be grateful in this
time of fiscal unrest that they can afford an Honors Convocation. So those
who attend will hopefully be stimulated by music as the University goes

through a slow, agonizing metamorphosis.

sible to produce the “Instant
Negro.”

Legislation can-/assure and

protect, but implementation‘

must come from an interra-
cial source -— those who, in
their hearts believe in the

not mean that work towards
this goal should be stopped,
or encouragement to con-
tinue working for this ob-
jective withheld.

Currently, there are 133
newspapers, with a combined
circulation of 1,504,356, con-
sidered as the Negro Press
in America, according to re-
liable ﬁgures. The latest
member to join the group is
the Alaska Spotlight, with
600 circulation, published in
Anchorage, Alaska.

MOST OF THE» newspa-
pers are weeklies, or semi-
Weeklies. There are two daily
newspapers, The Daily
World, published in Atlanta,
Ga. (the oldest daily); and

The Chicago Defender (both '

a daily and weekly), publish-
ed in Chicago, Ill.

General circulation of the
Negro Press has decreased
during the past 10 years.
Several factors have contri-
buted to this decline.

As integration increases,
the white press increases its
coverage of news about Ne-
groes. Also, the overall pro-
test format loses its degree
of intensity in some areas. It
should be made clear that
discrimination and ‘segrega-
tion continue to exist, but in
different forms and to‘ a

_ greater or lesser degree, de-

pending upon the Negro’s eco-

nomic, social and education
status and the area where
he lives. .

tional differences — all imi-
tations of the white major-

SINCE WHITE America
has’ been able to produce only
one successful New York
Times, Christian _ Science
Monitor and Fortune Mag-
azine, why expect Negroes,
who have suffered more de-
privations than any other
ethnic group“ in the United
States, to do the same or bet-
ter? May I remind, that des-
pite the aforementioned
three publications, The Daily
News of New York, a tab-
loid, surpasses any of them
in circulation, showing that
the “reading I.Q.” of said
whites is not “overly schol-
arly.”

The Pittsburgh Courier
(Pittsburgh, Pa., and nation-
al); Afro-American (Balti-
more, and national); Chica-
go Defender, national; Ams-
terdam News (New York,
and primarily local but with
some national circulation);
Norfolk Journal and Guide
(Norflok, Va., Tidewater
area and some national);
and Kansas City Call (Kan-
sas City, Mo., mostly local)
are considered the “Big Six” 1
of Negro journalism.

Ebony Magazine, publish-
ed in Chicago, -Ill., spread-
eagles the Negro magazine
ﬁeld. Its format resembles
that of Life Magazine and
its circulation runs very high.
It has some of the ﬁnest ad-
vertising the‘ Negro Press
ever has been able to obtain.

There is much’ to‘ be said
for the Negro Press in help-
ing the Negro travel this
far in his effort to achieve
ﬁrst-class citizenship. This
press has been his spokes-
man, his ﬁghter, his adviser,
the mirror for his accom-
plishments, his advocate at

  A Dose of Culture

That The Pitt News is the throbbing heart of the cul-
tural life of our University no one, least of all myself, can
deny. But alas, amid timely bulletins, thoughtful editorials
and learned columns one searches in vain for that pillar of
the sophisticated periodical, the book review.

With this in mind I dust off my library card and set
myself to reading some of the newer ‘products of our giant

-  r ‘ -- ~ - publishing industry. The reviews which fol-
low should ﬁll the aforementioned cultural
 gap for, oh, I’d say eight months to a year.
' Bobby (Random Selections) is a success
novel which surpasses anything of its kind.
Bobby Bazooka grows up among dirt-poor
farmers in Squalid, Okla., around.._.1935. The
story _opens just as Oklahoma State with
Bobby as quarterback runs onto the ﬁeld to
meet Arkansas in the Dust Bowl of that
- year. Oklahoma is beaten, 196 to 0, and Bob-

CIKOSKI by is tarred, feathered, hung in eﬂ"igy, and
run out of town on a rail. His spirit unbroken, Bobby feels
wiser for the experience, although‘, of course, a little sadder.

, So, armed only with the Good Book and an abiding
knowledge of nuclear physics, Bobby sets out into the World.
His travels take him to Big City, Ill., where he ﬁnds work
as a gum wrapper Waxer. From there his rise to wealth
and power is meteoric. Combing all of his talents, Bobby

       
   
 

scrapes together a shoestring. capital and plunges into the ’

development of Bobby’s Heavenly Atomic Gum. ,

At ﬁrst the going is rough, but Bobby’s spirits are kept
high by the love of Purina, who, I forgot to mention, se-
duced him on page~136. Also on’ pages 142, 147, and almost
every third page after that. ,

At last, his ambition realized, Bobby becomes the Gum
King. This truly American epic closes with the heart-warin-
ing scene where Bobby, the richest man in the country, re-
turns to his humble home town and with tears in his eyes
directs, the tar—and-feathering of everyone in sight.

Grandad (Doubletalk Co.) is the biography of Grandad
Pokes, one of the greats of aviation. Grandad learned engi-
neering on his father’s knee, which was difficult because his
father stood up quite a bit. Grandad made his ﬁrst mark
on aviation during» World War I when he shot down ten
planes. But since he had not left the States, the officers re-
fused to let him continue ﬂight training‘ and he became a
cook. ‘

Undaunted, Grandad began "designing aircraft. Dur-
ing World War II he built a ﬁghter with a fantastic range
and speed. But__ Grandad knew little about armaments and
when he insisted __on equipping his plane with shot-guns
the Army only laughed.

Grandad then taught himself. to sky-write in Japanese, .

but again the brass ...only pooh-poohed his accomplishment
and he became embit.t_ered.~:=*

Just prior to .,his?fdeath in 1956, Grandad tried once
more. He announced the design of a tiny pod which, placed
in -a vacuum, could sustain its occupant. indeﬁnitely. But
the Defense Department ignored him and Grandad died
unheard-of. —

Gymnasts Tangle
With W V U
Tomorrow Night

By MAX PEPPER

Tomorrow night“ the Pan-
ther gymnasts drag their
mediocre record to Morgan-
town, West Virginia, to perform
against the Mountaineer gym-
nasts. Even though the Moun-
taineers have a 5-1 record, the
prospect for a Panther victory
are the best they've been all year.
The Panther gymnastic coach
Warren Neiger said, “If we don't

‘beat West Virginia, we should be

shot. West Virginia is only a
mediocre team- that hasn’t had
very tough competition. There
top man, Ed Cross, dropped off
their team recently.”

West Virginia’s victory’s have

V been against poor squads from

the University of Virginia, Coast
Guard Academy, and William
and Mary. The only loss came at
the hands of a Merchant Marine
squad that could not even be
rated on a par with any of the
competition that the Panthers

.. have faced.

One. of the reasons for the
gymnast’s poor record is the class
of competition they’ve faced. The
Panther’s have dropped meets to
both Penn State and Springﬁeld,
the two top teams in the East.

A few weeks ago West Vir-
ginia’s top performer, Ed Cross,
quit the team without any reason.
It turned out that Cross, a sopho-
more who was rated one of the‘
most promising gymnasts in the

East, had gotten married. Cross

transferred to a small college
near Parkersburg, W. Va., to be
with his wife.

Even with a 3-6 record, there
have been a couple of bright
spots in the Panther’s season. The
workhorse of the team, Captain
Dave McKinnis, has racked up 14
ﬁrsts in nine meets against some

-' of the toughest competition in

the country. Most of his ﬁrsts
have been on the still rings and
in the floor exercise.

Track Team
Loses Fourth
Meet, 61-39

On Saturday the Panther track
team, according to their coach
should and could have done bet-
ter. They were close in many
events, but they were still beaten
by Penn State, 61-39.

The tracksters lost too many
events by inches and by tenths
of seconds, and this added up too
many points for the Nittany Lions
as they took all but two ﬁrst
places in ten events. “Two points
here and two points there made
the difference,” said coach Carl
Rees. “We should have done .bet-
ter.” -

Jim Flanigan missed a ﬁrst
place in the shot put by seven
inches. Dave Eichenlaub set a
new varsity record of nine min-
utes, 30.3 seconds in the two mile
run, but Art Morris of State set
a new Field House record and
beat Eichenlaub by six seconds.

Don Hinchberger ran the 1,000
yard race in two minutes, 14.3
seconds, beating the old varsity
and Field House records. Yet he
lost by one tenth of a second to
State's Bill Reilly in the most ex-
citing race of the day.‘

Another Field House record fell
in the high jump, as John Ca-
biatti, a State freshman, leapt six
feet, six and three quarter in-
ches. -

Bright spots for Rees’ athletes
were not totally absent. Dick
Crout once again won the 50
and Dev Lemster
vaulted 13 feet, six inches_to a
ﬁrst place in the pole vault. The
two mile relay team of Handel:
man, Dawson, Higgins and Hinch-
berger bettered their own varsity
record and won in seven, 56.2.
The mile relay team also won.

a crowd of 1,346 sawexperience coming out on the long end, 24-11.
If Dino Boni hadn’t been out with an injury and if a few flips had gone the other way,

the wrestling team might have
notched up a win.

“I’m really proud of those boys,”
said coach Dave Johnson.
“They’ve come a long way since

the beginning of the season. I _

couldn't ﬁnd fault with anybody’s
performance tonight.”

One of the most dejected peo-
ple after the meet was Ron Schu-
chert. He had just been pinned
by Lehigh’s NCAA champion
Mike Caruso, yet Johnson could-
n't have been prouder of him.
“He put all his heart into that
match.”

In the ﬁrst period of the 130
pound clash, Schuchert battled
Caruso on nearly equal terms for
the ﬁrst two minutes. At 1:10 Ca-
ruso scored his ﬁrst points for a
takedown.

When the referee brought his
hand down for the start of the
second period Schuchert pushed
the Engineer senior over on his
back and appeared to be in a
good position to ﬁnish the match
oif right there. But using speed
or experience or something he
had picked up in four years
of college wrestling, Caruso man-
aged to pull a complete reversal.

Schuchert managed to escape
but from that point on he was
ﬁghting against time. Caruso
moved in for another takedown
and then picked up three points
/for a near fall at the close of the
second period. The pin came with
1:13 left. in the ﬁnal period.

Lehigh’s other NCAA cham-
pion, Bill Stuart, didn’t resemble
his fearsome reputation at all in
his 145 pound match with Cliff
Zolikoif. Stuart appeared" as sur-
prised as everyone else when
Zolikoﬁ tripped him up after

only 30 seconds for two points.
Embarrassed, Stuart ﬂipped Zol-
ikoﬁf over and completed a smooth
reversal.
I In the second period it looked
hke Stuart was going to wrap
things up. He had Zolikoif in a

‘deﬁnite predicament and was

pressing for the fall. But Zolik-
off arched his back and some-

how managed to escape from
trouble.

The ﬁnal period was a stand
oﬁ and the match ended 8-3 in
Stuart’s favor. Joe Periotor, the
third member of Lehigh’s three
miniature musketeers, was cre.d-
ited with five points when the in-
jured Boni forfeited.

In the ﬁrst match of the night,
Dick Shildt (123) posted the
wrestlers to a short lived three
point lead when he decisioned
Dick Parson, 9-3. Parson might
have been on a track team the
way he was running around the
mat.

“I send my boys in there to
wrestle,” said Lehigh coach Gerry
Leeman. “I felt like getting up
and leaving when I saw Parson
backpeddling all over the place.”

At 152, Clair Riley put on one
of his best performances of the
year,. decisioning Elliott Tepper,
6-1. Tepper had posted a 6-1-1
record this season before Satur-
day night. With 20 seconds left
in the match it looked like Riley
was going to walk away with .a-
pin. He had Tepper on his back
but the buzzer sounded before he
could ﬁnish the fall.

In the next three matches Tim
Trax, Al Traunsteiner, and Ran-
dy Kahler were all decisioned.

Trax lost 9-7 and in several spots

‘he was in a position to pick up

some points for a near fall but
he just didn’t have the strength
to keep on the hold.

Sometimes it gets mono-
tonous to say ——- John Lane
won two freestyle events,
but the swimming team lost.
However, Lane did win two
ﬁrsts and Army did brand-
ish the swimmers, 65-30, last
Saturday in New’ York.

_ In the meet, it was a matter
of too few against too many. The
Cadets managed to break through
for a ﬁrst in every event except
Lane's freestyle specialties and-
Joe LeViere’s backstroke.

“Army has wonderful support
in all the events,” coach Ben
Grady said. “But they must have
too many since they. play top-
notch competition year-round.”
In eight meets, the cadets are

"undefeated.

Grady was “not displeased’
with the swimn_1ers showing and
said they did “a real good job.”

“In the next couple weeks, if
some of the boys concentrate and
get the work done then by the
end of the season these boys
could go to the Easterns,” Grady
said. The Easterns are scheduled
for March 12.

The boys Grady spoke of in-
clude Lane, LeViere, and Don
Hahnfeldt, Lane Won the 200-
yard freestyle, beating Army’s

Lynn Hunt. In the 500-yarder, he '

seesawed for the front post with
cadet Jack Cummins, for 35‘0
yards, ﬁnally winning in his best
time yet, 5:19.l.

Lane’s time against Army was
about 13 seconds better than he
did in the previous with Syra-
cuse. Grady gives the reason for
this.

“A swimmer cannot get his time
down unless he swims against-
fast competition,” he said. “You”
have to have someone out in
front of you in order to chal-
lenge time. I schedule teams like
Army so the fellows can see them
and swim against the best.”

LeViere won the 200-yard back-
stroke, beating Hunt with a time
of 2:07. Rusty Lindberg placed
third. “As far as the Easterns are
concerned.” Grady said, “Le-
