Many of the nation’s mayors are

,2 ‘busy again today after a full day of

activities Monday, including
speeches and lectures by presiden-
tialv candidates, a U.S. senator,
membersof the Carter Adminis-
tration, and fellow mayors at the,
47th annual National Conference of
Mayors. ‘ , V

The.confe'rence is being held at
the "Pittsburgh Hilton Hotel and

Monday’s session of the confer-
ence featured a luncheon address
by General George Seignious,
Director of the Arms Control and
Disarmanent Agency.

Seignious told the mayors the
United States is .‘ ‘better off” with
the SALT II treaty than without
it.

_‘‘We learned within the past
decade the security interests of

' _both the United States and the

Soviet Union could be served,” he
said, “by negotiating some con-

_ _- straints, some limits, some controls

on this most deadly competition in

- nuclear weapons.”

According to Seignious, the Salt

1] Treaty not only limits the number
of nuclear weapons deployed by the
two superpowers, it also limits the
development of certain new wea-
pons systems.

One of the points of contention
between supporters and opponents
of SALT II is the question of
verification of compliance with the
treaty.

Seignious said aggreement is
confirmable and he will give every
Senator the necessary information
to show this ‘verifiability during
hearings before the Senate.

Later in the , afternoon, the
chairman of the Republican Confer-
ence of Mayors, accompanied by
three fellow Republicans, criticized
President Carter for not alleviating
many of the problems facing
American cities.

E. Clay Shaw, Jr., mayor of Ft.
Lauderdale, Florida, said the
Carter Administration has
bureaucracized many federal aid
programs leaving them ineffective.

“Most of these programs are no
longer designed to be operated at
the local level,” he said. “Instead
the decisions are now made in
Washington, where there is little, if
any understanding of the different

Republican presidential can-

said the energy crisis poses grave
implications for the world's demo-

' societies “respond to it boldly and

with a sens_e.of urgency.”

“It is a simple fact that, in the
United States, unless we can bring

bare minimum two percent annual
increase in consumption,” he said.
“We shall be unable to sustain an
acceptable rate of economic growth
during the 1980’s.” '

Connally made his remarks at

the U.S. Conference of Mayors at_

the Pittsburgh Hilton.

Connally said the shortage of
energy supplies and its effects are
not being presented clearly to the
American people. '

“What is being portrayed as a
seasonal incon-
venience, a problem no greater
than finding gasoline on weekends,

actually is much more,” Connally b

said.

prove to be the onset of a long,
severe and cruel night for this
American society,” he said. ‘

Politics is responsible for our
current energy problems and what
the United States perceives as an
energy crisis is, in reality, a
political crisis, according to Con-
na1ly.-- ,

Connally added President Carter
is not solely responsible for the
politics. Rather, he said, the
politics have existed for almost 30
years. ’

“Not for three years, but more
nearly for three decades or longer,
our prevailing politics has devoted
itself to frustrating, obstructing
and preventing the measures
necessary to produce the oil and
gas, mine and burn the coal and
eliminate the costly and unneces-
sary delays in the construction of

our nuclear power plants,” he said.

Connally said the nation must
bring together a group of experts
from all sectors of american society
to examine the energy problem and
develop a program for the United
States to achieve energy self
sufficiency. '

"Specifically, I believe such an

Pittsburgh—a side stereotypical
thinking never acknowledges but

.\ has always been evident on a small

scale in several city sectors.
At the Festival, though, it is all
brought together and the result is
electrifying. _

There is something for everyone,‘
from exhibits by local artists ‘and
training schools to demonstrations,
of crafts such, as weaving,
woodcutting and wheel‘ thrown
pottery. Drama clubs, dance
troupes and mimes from not only
this area, but from across the
country, rock groups and folk
groups and soloists and ethnic
singers, poetry readings and
quilting demonstrations and ﬁlms,
and the list goes on and on.

Many of the activities run daily
at a set time; particularly events for
children. At Gateway 3” Plaza, near
the Hilton Hotel, you can watch
children draw giant wall murals as
part of an observance of the

‘International Year of the Child; at
Westinghouse Plaza, children
weave a growing wirestructure. A
special don’t miss attraction has
got to be “Festisaurus,” a 15 foot
long dragon-dinosaur, still being

afternoon from 1-4 p.m.

No Need For ‘Affirmative Relief’

According To U.S. Supreme Court ‘

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON-A unanimous
Supreme Court ruled yesterday
that handicapped persons have no
legal right to attend a school if they
cannot meet the school’s physical
qualiﬁcations.

In a stunning defeat for
handicapped persons nationwide,
the justices ruled that a 1973 law
designed to end bias against the
handicapped does not force col-
leges and universities to offer
“affirmative relief” for such
persons.

Yesterday's decision reversed a
lower court’s ruling that South-
eastern Community College in
Whiteville, N.C. violated federal
‘law when it turned down Frances
Davis for its nursing program.

“Nothing in the language or
history of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973 reflects an intention to limit
the freedom of an educational
institution to require reasonable
physical qualifications for admis-
sion to a clinical training pro-
gram,” Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.
said for the court.

“Nor has’ there been any
showing in this case that any action
short of a substantial /change in
Southeastern’s program would
render unreasonable the qualiﬁca-
tions it imposed,” he said.

One section of the 1973 law

prohibits programs or activities-

receiving federal aid fromdiscrim-
inating against any “otherwise
qualiﬁed handicapped individual.”
g Yesterday’s -ruling found that
Mrs. Davis, who suffers from a
loss, was not
qualiﬁed for the nursing program

Sera-Tec
Biologicals

solely because of her physical
handicap.

Mrs. Davis. now 46 and a
licensed practical nurse for the past
12 years, sought in 1974 to join
Southeastern’s associate nursing
program leading to licensing as a
registered nurse.

Unlike a practical nurse, a
registered nurse is allowed to
perform some sophisticated medi-
cal tasks.

There was never any question
that Mrs. Davis, a Fairmont, N.C.,
resident who had been an under-
graduate student at Southeastern
during the 1973-1974 school year,
was academically qualiﬁed for
admission to the nursing program.

But because of a serious hearing

impairment, she can communicate.

with others only when she wears a
hearing aid and looks directly at the
talker to read lips.

Southeastern ofﬁcials submitted
an audiologist’s report‘: to the
executive director of the North
Carolina Board of Nursing, who
said Mrs. Davis should be advised
“to alter her career goal.”

The school was told that her

handicap would make her incap- '

able of performing various’ duties
assigned to a registered nurse,
such as aiding in operations when
surgical masks are worn.

A federal trial judge dismissed
Mrs. Davis’ lawsuit, but the 4th
U.S. Circuit court of Appeals ruled
that Southeastern had violated the
law in rejecting Mrs. Davis‘
application. —

The appeals court sent the case
back to U.S. District Judge Robert

Hemphill with orders to give “close _-

attention" to Mrs. Davis’ request
for some form of “afﬁrmative,
relief” by modifying its nursing
program to accommodate her
hearing disability.

—Yesterday’s Supreme Court rul-
ing struck down the appeals court
order to Hemphill.

Powell’s opinion was based
chiefly‘ on his interpretation of the
“otherwise qualified” wording of
the 1973 law._

“We think it clear that the

Department of Health. Education
and Welfare interprets the “other”
qualiﬁcations which a handicapped
person may be required to meet as
including necessary physical quali-
ﬁcations,” Powell said.

His opinion added: “We do not
suggest that the line between a
lawful refusalto extend affirmative
action and illegal discrimination
against handicapped persons al-
ways _will be clear.

“It is possible to envision
situations where an insistence on
continuing past-re_quire-merits and
practices might-arbitrarily deprive
genuinely" qualiﬁed handicapped
persons of the opportunity to
participate in a covered pro-
gram....” . _

“In this case, however, it is clear

.. that Southeas'tern’s unwillingness

to make major adjustments in its
nursing program*d0es not consti-
tute such discrimination,” Powell
said.

Mrs. Davis’ case had been
closely watched. The high court
received 16 friend-of-the-court
briefs, eight urging them to uphold
the appeals court ruling and eight
urging reversal.

  Should A ﬂrletes Receive Preferential Treatment?
O n th e Ru n

Over five years ago, an article in The Pitt News
concerning athletes and the “preferential treatment”
given them in certain cases was cause for much con-D
troversy. -v

A recent article in the University Times naming
five Pitt athletes as candidates for academic
ineligibility is merely part of a growing debate that
touches upon the same subject as did the Pitt News
five years ago. Do athletes receive preferential
treatment and if so, do they deserve it?

Participating in collegiate sports and handling the
work load of full-time student isn’t easy. While one
may choose to think of Pitt athletics as only football
and basketball, the average Panther athlete is not
some professional sports-bound jock whose main
purpose for attending college is comparable to spen-
ding four years in a baseball farm system.

To stay competitive, let alone win, many athletes
must work out twice a day. Class schedules must be
arranged accordingly if both are mandatory prac-
tices. Last season, basketball coach Tim Grgurich
held 7 a.m. practices during the first months of the
season while members of the swim teams trekked up
to Trees Pool before breakfast for the day’s first
workout. ‘

Then there is the problem of missing classes
because of out-of-state competitions. With football,
the team isgout of town only four or five times a year,
minus any bowl trips, but for the schools’ other “big-
time” sport, basketball, the season can be one long
road.trip. This also applies to long-distance runners,
who, in some years, had all but perhaps a half—dozen
weekends booked up with cross-country, indoor and
outdoor meets.

As a Pitt athlete, I am only too well aware of the
extra academic problems faced: by one who must
budget his or her time for studying around the many
hours that must be devoted to a chosen sport.

.For many Pitt athletes, sports on the competitive
level will stop after graduation and there are also

By MARIA SCIULLO

many who receive no financial aid for their par-
ticipation in Panther athletics, thus sports serve as an
outlet and not a possible means of future support.
We aren’t all Tony Dorsetts; no one is offering Kathy
Stetler, Pitt’s other four-time all-American, a multi-
million dollar contract.

In a recent letter to the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette,
former CAS Dean Robert Marshall stated while he
would rather see an end to the big—business part of
college sports, it does exist and therefore should not
go unnoticed.

 

A winning football or basketball team benefits the
university in many ways, not the least of which
financially. ‘

Current CAS dean Irwin Schulman, through his I

handling of last month’s case of the five aforemen-
tioned athletes, seems to believe those Pitt student
athletes are merely students, nothing more. It is
unrealistic to ignore the pressures placed upon

..college athletes, particularly those in “must-win”

sports.

Would the University Times have violated the
Buckley Amendment, which prohibits the publishing
of a student’s academic record or mention thereof, if
the five students had been math majors, and mothing
more?

Would Joe Schmo, average liberal arts major, '
have made headlines for getting involved in a street- ,

fight? Probably not.

On a sport-to-sport basis, of course some teams ‘

travel, eat and are dressed better than others. It
would be a bit much to expect the football team to
ride a bus to South Bend, Indiana. Again, weare
talking money. But that’s the way college sports are
today, will be in the future and anyone who believes
otherwise is either very naive or has been‘watchi'ng

too many reruns of Ozzie and Harriet..

Pitt has tutors available to its athletes to compen-
sate for missed class time. This is not excessively
preferential treatment. While the NCAA has set a
minimum QPA for its ‘athletes, Dean Schulman
could choose to set his own standard. But to do so
with little or no regard to the circumstances involved
in being a student athlete in this decade would be un-
fair. '

Runner Roger Winstanley, an electrical
engineering student, is just one of the
many. Pitt athletes who face the problem
