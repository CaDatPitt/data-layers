Peace Groups Seek
War’s End Through  

Civil Disobedience

Mayday. a week of demon-
strations and massive civil dis-

-obedience. is slated for the first

week of
D.C.

Mayday participants hope to
convince the government to end
the war in Vietnam. free all
"political prisoners." and guar-
antee a family of four a $6500
annual income. They will em-
ploy disruptive tactics of vari-
ous sorts. including stalling traf-
fic on Washington‘s 14th Street
bridge. a major artery.

Heralding Mayday. bands of
students have already begun
their protests. One group stag-
ed a hunger strike in Senator
Hugh Scott's office before being
arrested: another staged a
"massacre" in Senator Barry
Goldwater's office. smearing his
walls with red paint; others
formed a “wailing wall" in the
Capitol building.

Mayday comes‘ in the wake of
a peaceful march on the Capi-
to! Saturday by between 200,000
and 500,000 people and a week-
long protest by Vietnam war
veterans opposed to the war.

May in Washington.

According to Virginia Joyce
a contributor to the Media Com-
mittee of Mayday. "Mayday
will probably cause an enor-
mous number of people to come
to Washington. because it has
more than radical student sup-
portf'

Recently. such groups as the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. the National Wel-
fare Rights Organization. the
United Farmworkers of Ameri-

ca. Vietnam Veterans for Peace.
and the Veterans for Peace en-
dorsed Mayday.

Joyce also cited a recent Gall-
up poll, which showed that 50

percent of the American people.

are dissatisfied with the Presi-
dent's Vietnam policy.

The organization of Mayday
is unlike any other anti-war
demonstration. There is very
little national coordination.
and most of the activity has

been planned on a local
level.
"Tactics of the Pittsburgh

people." Joyce said. “are to stay
in affinity groups. which are
units of two to six members.
in order to provide the maxi-

mum flexibility in operations
and communications."
The Pittsburgh contingent’s

objective, shared by groups from
Ohio, New Hampshire, and
Vermont, is to block, through
civil disobedience, the Wash-
ington side of the Theodore
Roosevelt Bridge. This roadway
leads directly into the Penta-
gon area in Virginia.

The demonstrators hope their
tactics will cause large num-
bers of police and government
troops using tear gas to further
block traffic.

Locally. on May 1. a march
will be held. to be followed
by a rally with speakers explain-
ing the demands of Mayday.
Various workshops are also sche-
duled. Local actions will pre-
sage national action in Washing-
ton May2.

Hillside, Forbes Field Projects Stalled

Pitt Expansion Delayed

by HARRIS MILLER

The University. presently in the
midst of discussions with repre-
sentatives of the Oakland com-
munity and the City of Pittsburgh.
has delayed work. perhaps perma-
nently. on two of its major con-
struction projects. the Hillside
Dormitory complex and Forbes
Complex. Phase I.

The delay is in response to re-
quests by members of ‘Peoples
Oakland. a conglomerate of local
community groups. for revisions
in the plans for these two pro-
jects. It is the desire of Peoples
Oakland to have the plans re-
drawn with community input. The
present agreements for delay
have been worked out in a series
of meetings between the three
groups.

To date. Edison Montgomery.
Vice-Chancellor for Finance. act-
ing as the major representative
at the negotiations for the Uni-
versity. has granted three re-
quests of the community.

First, he has agreed that the
University will restudy the pro-
posed dormitory project in con-
junction with community repre-
sentatives. Although the Universi-
ty has the legal regulations neces-
sary to begin work on the project
through the City Planning Com-
mission, the Vice-Chancellor and
Hunt Martin, director of the Phy-
sical Plant Division, have indi-
cated that the three objections
raised by the community are seri-
ous enough to warrant further
consideration. These three objec-
tions—people congestion, traffic
congestion, and lack of aesthetic
value — are hoped to be met
through revised plans. The Uni-
versity has put forth only the de-

Students Back Tuition Parity

by SUE HOENSTINE

Executive Assistant
Tuition disparities between
state-related universities and

management within the Universi-
ty were among the questions pos-
ed to the State Senate Appropria-
tions Committee by Pitt represen-
tatives last Thursday.

Mike Haley. a math and econom-
ics major. and Wade Lawson.
Committees Commissioner of the
Student Association. attended the
Harrisburg hearings with other
student representatives from
State-related universities and pri-
vate medical schools.

Senator Benjamin Danolow.
chairman of the Senate Appropri-
ations Committee. called the ses-
sion to learn student opinions on
state funding of academic insti-
tutions.

Haley suggested that tuition
rates at Pitt, Penn State, and
Temple be equalized. Presently.
tuition at Penn State totals $675
per year, in comparison to $970 a
year at Temple and $850 per year
at Pitt.

Haley criticized the policy of

approving separate benefits ‘for-
. eawinstitution .r9a.s9r!<¥“l?ats 

‘F.

 

the appropriation of state funds
was a political matter. He sug-
gested a formula approach based
on the number and type of stu-
dents. services offered. and re-
search carried out at each univer-
sity.

Haley said that this approach
would make appropriations more
equitable and prevent higher ben-
t'its from being alloted to institu-
tions that were best able to “sell
themselves“ to the state legisla-
tors.

Lawson pointed out that tuition
at Pitt has increased about $300
since 1968, but the increased tui-
tion was not accompanied by an
increase in state appropriations.
He added that although its tuition
is lower. Penn State enjoys a high-
er state appropriation.

The Pitt representatives also
attacked the management of funds
within the University. Lawson
said that about $2 million is spent
for student services. He and Hal-
ey questioned services from the
administration for activities that
students actually manage.

Hale_v also emphasized that ad-
ministrators and faculty mem-
bers should be made aware of

  

what productivity means. He sug-
gested that a clearer division of
labor within academic depart-
ments could free faculty mem-
bers from auxiliary duties and
leave more time for teaching.

A study by Dr. Mark Perlman
of the Economics Department
was cited by Lawson and Haley.
Perlman found that faculty sal-
aries are based on a 40 hour week
and that seven hours of this time
is alloted for University business.
Lawson contended that if faculty
members are paid to attend meet-
ings and to advise students, there
should be a mechanism to check
if faculty members are carrying
out these duties.

Unsupervised faculty research
was also criticized by Haley. He
suggested the establishment of a
private corporation that would al-
locate research grants and check
the progress of professors‘
studies. Haley pointed out that for
every federally-t'unded dollar
granted for research. the Univer-
sity loses 20 cents. By separating
research funds from the Univer-

.sity. Haley maintained that stu-

dents would not lose money on
nonproductive studies.

  

mand that the bulk of the 1,200-
bed need be met through any new
dormitorities.

Second. the University is pre-
pared to underwrite up to one-
third of the $50.000 budget pro-
posed by the community for the
community's use in participating
in cooperative planning. The Vice-
Chancellor has stipulated that the
budget must be administered by
the City Planning Department or
an acceptable board of represen-
tatives. The money would go to-
ward office space and full time
architects. The City's major rep-
presentative. Robert J. Paternos-
ter. City Planning director. has
agreed to also seek funds to meet
the proposed budget.

Finally. the University has
agreed to one final delay in the
demolition of Forbes Field. This
30 delay until the third week of
May is being granted so that the
community can attempt to find a
way to implement its plans for
the revitilization of the 62 year
old structure. The community
plan. developed by architect Troy
West. is an elaborate design which
would include such aspects of
community-University life as liv-
ing space. classrooms. open areas
and commercial areas.

Foot-Sore And Weary-

vol. 65, no. ‘N

Montgomery has refused to at -
cept the plan as one for the Un
versity to develop for two majo
reasons—the lack of the require
office and classroom space an

the lack of available funding fo .

such a project. The academi-

buildings that the University pr(

posed to build on the present sit-

of the former big league park art
to be funded by the General State»
Authority. According to Montgom»
ery. the state would be unwilling.-
to build a structure that is not fo.
purely academic uses.

It the community is able to de- A

velop its own funding for the pro
ject (a reported $3 million alonc

to buy the land from the state) ’ C I

then the University will acquiesce
to its desires. .

The University has also an
nounced to the community that if
will within a month present its fi
nal design for the Forbes I com
plex to the community and ther
to the City Planning Commission.
A failure by the community tr
find funding for its project by the
deadline will presumably mean
demolition of Forbes Field and
commencement of the machina-
tions required to build the new
edifices in the Forbes Field area.

Court Ruling Awaited

by RON Lozowsxl

A The Pennsylvania State Legislature may re-
form concerning the present abortion statutes.
. , Threebills have already been introduced.

.‘ A measure co-sponsored by State Representa-

-V tives “Gerald Kaufman and Jay Wells stipulates
is that “any woman in the Commonwealth shall
have the right to a medically safe abortion, pro-
viding her request for abortion is made prior to
completion of 16 weeks of pregnancy.”

S ‘A further portion of the bill provides that
p abortions could only be performed by duly licens-
"ed physicians and within “an accredited hospi-
tal or other medical facility." Kaufman hopes
this will prevent “back alley abortionists" from
‘- ‘running rampant.
. V Kaufman had previously introduced a bill
' last June, calling for the modification of the
1 present rules on abortion. but the bill died in
legislative committee. He feels that the existing
Q. law"'is vague and ambiguous, and does not clear-
"ly~ state when an abortion may be lawfully per-
,6 .. formed. According to Harrisburg observers, his
‘ proposal is not likely to pass.

‘by State Senators Wayne Ewing and Thomas ‘I

 FState Seeks Abortion Reforms

Lamb. Their measure endeavors to limit legaliz-
ed abortion to three situations :

(1) when the health of the mother is endan- A.

gered:
(2) in cases of rape:
(3) in situations involving incest.

Opponents of the bill argue that one of the
bill's major drawbacks lies in the determination
of the latter two states. The woman desiring the
abortion would have to be placed in the hands of
a committee of doctors at the hospital or institu-
tion where the operation is to be performed. This
designated panel would then decide whether or
not the woman‘s case was one provided for by
the abortion rules.

Critics also contend that this process may
force the mother to undergo undue stress and
humiliation.

Furthermore. if permission for the abortion
is not granted. some fear that the mother's repu-
tation may be damaged.

Despite these arguments. Senator Lamb feels
a need for strict abortion laws. He has express-
ed concern over the fact that there have been

roughly 90.000 abortions in New York since July ‘

1. Loosening of the laws here. he fears. could re-
sult in a similar.situation.

The Senator was also distressed by the ap-
pearance of billboards in Pennsylvania. encour-
aging women to travel to New York to receive
legal abortions.

The third—and most conservative—measure

was recently introduced in the House by State‘

Representative Martin Mullens of Philadelphia.
Enactment of this measure would prevent abor-
tions from being performed under any circum-
stances whatsoever, even at_the cost of the moth-
er’s life.

Although the three bills are conflicting in
nature. state legislators stress that some com-
promise must be reached. The current abortion
law‘s constitutionality is pending a decision by
the Statesupreme Court.

Kaufman fears that if the law is found to-be
unconstitutional. Pennsylvania would be without
any restrictions on abortions. opening the door for
"back alley abortionists."

In the meantime. Governor Milton Shapp has
suggested that he appoint a committee. compos-

ed entirely of women. to delve into the facts of
abortion.

Senate Vote Could .

End Draft In ’72

by BILL GORMLEY

WASHINGTON. D.C. —— Some-
time in May. the Senate will con-
sider a proposal to end the draft
in one year instead of two.

According to Senator Richard
Schweiker (R-Pa.), who will in-
troduce proposal extending the
draft for only one year, “there’s
a better than even chance of its
passing.”

Schweikers proposal will take
the form of an amendment to a
bill extending the Selective Ser-
vice Act. which expires latexin
June.

Amendments similar to Schwei-
ker's have already been intro-
duced by Senator Harrison Wil-
liams (D-N.J.) and Senator Birch
Bayh (D-Ind. ).

Conference Settlement

If the Senate approves a one-
year extension of the draft. a
conference committee will have
to iron out differences between
House and Senate versions.

- On March 31. the House voted
down a one-year extension by
200-198. choosing instead a two
year extension.

“Normally.“ Senator Schweik-
er explained in an interview last
week. “a conference committee
favors the Houses vers.i0n of a
bill.“ Because of the tight vote
in the House. however. Schwei-
ker believes the one-year exten-
sion stands a fair chance in con-
ference.

Senator Williams concurs.
“Theres going to be a continua-
tion of the draft." Williams ob-
served Friday. "That's a fact of
life."

But, according to Williams,
“the ground is fertile” for ex-
tending the draft for only one
more year.

The Schweiker amendment.

As Counseling Begins Expansion

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Plans to expand the career and
graduate school advising facili-
ties at the University Counseling
Center must wait until Harris-
burg allocates funds for the com-
ing fiscal year to the University.

Dr. Robert Gallagher. director
of the Center, said that the hir-
ing of a career specialist and a
coordinator for the post-bacca-
laureate counseling program will
be delayed at least until the end
of June when University budgets
are due to be approved.

Allocations Committee Plans
Review of Organization Budgets

by CAROLE COVAL
The Student Association (SA)

Allocations Committee will be-
gin

interviewing organization

officers in an attempt to evalu-
ate proposed budget requests.
The interviewing process will be
held Saturday, May 1, through
Friday, May 7.

The» Committee will discuss
budget limitations with 70 Uni-
versity organizations which have
submitted budget outlines.

Thomas F. Tackage. Assistant

Director of Student Activities.
said that this additional effort

will lend “better insight into the
budgeting problem."

Under the revised Student SA
Constitution. the seven members
of the Allocations Committee
will make recommendations on
budget expenditures to the So-
cial Commission.

Seven members of the Social
Commission and its head, Lenny
Klavonik, will approve the bud-
get proposal or send it back to
the Allocations Committee for re-
vision.

In the case that revision is not
made. the Social Commission has
the power to overrule the Allo-
cation Committees‘ recommen-
dations. if eight of its 11 mem-
bers so vote.

Tackage said that the Alloca-
tions Committee has been view-
ed as a structure which tends to
stalemate the structures deci-
sions. This Constitutional change
should eliminate this difficulty.
he said.

Tackage also stressed the con-
scious attempts to make the com-
mittee what he termed “an apo-
litical committee. "

“Not evaluating each budget

objectively.“ he said. "can be a
detriment to all of the organiza-
tions." The new structure pro-
vides a “check and balance." he
said.

in the Cathedral to the Counsel-

The move was designed to fa--
cilitate the procedure students

Although funds for the remain-

the money will not be available
for use by the Counseling Cen-
ter. Because it is no longer an

sider by Student Development

Senator Tries Dialogue

by BILL GORMLEY
Editor

WASHINGTON, D.C. - As we neared Penn-
sylvania Avenue, the old woman spied a pro-war
_contingent edging the stream of marchers. “How
can anyone ‘possibly support the War in Viet-
nam?” she asked. ‘ ‘

“The War is supported by well-intentioned
but mistaken men,” I tried to explain. “They’re
as sincere as we are, but they’re obsessed by a
specter of world communism.”

.Dialogue didn’t seem apropos, though, Satur-
day in Washington, D.C. We were participating
in a demonstration. We marched with people
of like minds - expressing ourselves without
words.

  Protest Ritual Lures Marchers

a ritual? Is it anything more than a pro forma
exercise in self-expression? A flashy symbol. to
be sure. but a futile effort.

I made the point the day before to Senator

Williams of New Jersey. He surprised me. I just

wanted to ask a few questions. But he wanted to
know what I thought — about the current cam-
pus mood, the state of the student movement, the
value of protest. "

I told him I would march because 'I‘m ve-
hemently opposed to the War. But nothing would
come of the march. I said. It lacked practical’
worth. I

He listened intently. but gently disagreed.
Take the veterans. he argued. They really touch-
ed the heart of America with their protest.

Youlhave a point. I responded. The veter-
ans talked with Senators and Congressmen. They

spoke eloquently. And they were respected. be-

cause they spoke from experience.
But, I reminded, student protests are differ-

ent. We can’t speak persuasively about the war,

because everyone knows that many of us
might be drafted to fight in it once we leave
our sanctuaries. When we demonstrate, it is
considered a matter of course. Our protests are
dismissed as predictable.

My cynicism has not ebbed. I returned to
Pittsburgh to find" headlines about "militants"
descending on the nations Capital. I have come
to expect such a distortion from the Pittsburgh
Press, which cannot distinguish between civil
disobedience and hooliganism. But surely the
students who are going to Washington. D.C. for
May Day and its sequel know that they will be
treated mercilessly by the government and the
media. Why engage in a protest that will at
best not prove counterproductive‘?

Perhaps it’s because the demonstration has
become a student habit - a new spring rite. The

' subdued, nonchalant tone of Saturday’s march

underlines this impression. _
Many of us participated‘ in the march. I

think, because we had to do something but didn't

know what to do. -We stand guilty of a failure

‘ of imagination.
The harbingers» of May Day. in contrast.‘

have a Vivid imagination. On Monday. they splat-
tered Senator Barry Goldwaters office with red
paint-staging their version of a massacre.

Cute and cool, but hardly courageous. The
painters left before. the police arrived, and that
is not civil disobedience. No, it is grist for the
counterrevolutionary’s mill.

I want to believe that the 70 year old wom-

an who accompanied me to the march was a-

typical of the protestors. I hope that most of
Saturdays marchers believe that those who con-
tinue the war arereasonable and sincere. albeit
misguided. people.

The attitude, I think. is important. Our sal-
vation. if it‘s coming. surely lies in communi-
cation. not its opposite. Persuasion is more diffi-
cult than expression. It is tedious. taxing. and not
always productive. And respect is less convenient
than ridicule. But we cannot abandon a commit-
ment to dialogue.

Opinion Editor
‘ As most Pitt students were fin-
ishing their final exams, history
was being made in California.

On Monday. April 12. the of-
fices of the Stanford Daily were
entered and searched by police-
men with a warrant. The courts
felt the paper would have some
incriminating pictures taken at
a sit-in the previous Friday.

The news is enough to make
any journalist shudder. I

News photos are taken to give
the readers a better idea of what
a situation was like. The pictures
taken at the Stanford sit-in were
obtained legally and without any
tricks.

If the photographers were able
to catch some incriminating
evidence on film. the police pre-
sent should have been alert en-
ough to make the necessary warn-
ings er arrests..on...the.seene. ea. 

As it was. the police tried to
use the Stanford photographers as
watchdogs. -

If they felt that certain photos
were essential to a conviction,
the the Daily could easily have been
subpoenaed and their pictures
presented in court. But instead,
their offices were searched as
if they were, harboring stolen

. goods.

Admittedly. it is important for
the police to do their job. On oc-
casion. a press photographer will
catch proof of a person's guilt
or innocence. and in these cases
it is only right for press mater-
ials to be released to the courts.

But to obtain a search warrant
and raid offices is certainly not
treating the newspaper fairly. and
is simply a step toward a govern-
ment-controlled press.

Events such as the one at Stan-

 Signs Destroy-’Z'm1atit Paar g

Voters Mess It Up

(Editor's Note: This columnlwas written by “a disconcerted under-

graduate” who asked that his name be withheld.)

During a recent undergraduate organizational election. I had
the unfortunate chance to discover how little integrity many of the
undergraduate students have in such matters.

During the campaigning preceeding the elections. the lack of
respect that these students have for one another was clearly shown
by the desecration of the candidates’ signs. both in the writing of
obscene graffiti upon them. and by tearing them up into small piec-
es and leaving them to litter residence floors. lobbies. and other

public areas.

The most disheartening part was the poor voting response among
those students who were eligible to vote. The election was widely

publicized but the students just didn’t seem to care any more than

making an effort to embarrass the people involved.

Now. it would seem to me that students who have expressed
great concern over social and cultural change. pollution and litter-
ing. poor communications. and not becoming involved in the cor-
ruption that they have’ seen. inprevious generations would act diff-

erently than they have.

The lack of consideration and interest shown in this recent event
(although the desecration may be the work of a limited number)
does not exhibit the reality of concerns being expressed.

Surely we are more mature than to have to stoop to writing
dirty words on campaign posters and ostracizing able. and willing
participants. Surely we are mature enough to channel our energies
constructively and exercise our right to state opinion in the proper

manner.

I am disappointed that University of Pittsburgh students would
engage in such childish and time-wasting activities and can only
hope that in the future those same students will show better judgement

Chauvinism Admitted

Editor.

As a male. I was saddened by
Mike Haley’s article attacking
women’s liberation. I think I
understand his feelings some-
what—it is difficult for the tar-
get of a revolution to avoid
lashing out at forces not fully
grasped. The ego naturally mov-
es to defend itself. Mr. Haley‘s
confusion "shines through again
and again in his article.

To begin with, I want to as-
sure Mr. Haley that I, too, am a
male chauvinist. I urge him to

join me in the healthy self-criti-‘

cism I have all to recently un-
dertaken. It is no sin to admit
the sexism conditioned into us
all; the sin lies in doing noth-
ingabout it.

Let‘s realize. for example.
that American sexuality—even
spring romance—-has strayed pret-
ty far from poetry or even honest
lust. If legsare sexy, do peek-a-
boo skirt length games have

real relevance? Personally. I
am fighting to take the power to
turn me on away from the mini-
skirt manufacturers.

Some of my sisters have not-
iced that parading their skin for
L; appraisal creates an inference
that the viewing male is some
sort of presiding judge bestow-
ing his favors on the lucky win-
her.

These sisters have rejected
this patent nonsense and will
not appear in this year’s sexist
Easter parade. They have struck
a blow for individual freedom
and for meaningful sexuality.

Mr. Haley's confounding of
sex and sexism is older than this
notion. Achieving female and
male liberation would be a great
victory for ourselves and for the
future. The hardest battle to win.
Mr. Haley, is in your own head.

You've dreamed about your
diamond engagement ring a thou-
sand times. But now that you
know it's for keeps, it's time to
stop dreaming and start learning
about diamonds and their value.

Because no two diamonds
are exactly alike, jewelers have
adopted exacting standards to de-
termine the relative value of each
and every diamond in the world.
These standards include a dia-
mond’s size (carat weight), color,
cut and clarity.

ASTROLITE

 

COLOR: Fine white diamonds are
quite rare and valued accordingly.
Other shades in relative order of

their worth are:
brown and black.

CUT: The cut of a diamond—the
facets placed on it by a trained
cutter—-—brings out the gem’s ﬁre
and brilliance. Anything less than
correct cut reduces beauty, bril-
liance and value.

CLARITY: Determined by the ab-
sence of small impurities. A per-
fcct diamond has no impurities
when examined under ten power
magniﬁcation by a trained eye.

CARAT: A diamond’s size is
measured in carats. As a diamond
increases in size, its price will
increase even more if the quality
remains constant. But larger dia-
monds of inferior quality may ac-
tually be worth less thansmaller,

Adaisar Sums llp Evaluation

Editor.

Now that the Course Evaluation is appearing
on a regular schedule. it is being treated with in-
creasing interest by students and faculty alike.

As faculty advisor to the Evaluation commit-
tee. I judge that interest by the frequency of fa-
culty comments and complaints (often justified)
and the speed with which the books disappear
(4500 copies were handed out in 6 hours the
last time). A

A major source of troubleiin the evaluation

is the attempted summary of written comments. I

Students claim that they want them because the
numbers alone are too dull or too detailed or
just vaguely unpleasant.

My guess is that the students usually want
a short phrase or two which characterize the
course. As the numerical data and the distribu-
tion of answers make clear. however.‘ courses
typically bring forth a spectrum of responses
and not a simple consensus.

When the range of responses is narrow. then
some clear consensus and prediction can be made
about the course. Normally. however. students will
have to confront the essentially diffuse nature
of the “truth" which they seek about a course.

Faculty complain, legitimately in most cas-
es, that the summary of comments tend to focus
on the extreme statements. This tendency toward
extremes is the same phenomena that distorts
our news; normal events hardly seem worth re-
porting. Summaries must be read knowing that
this bias is frequently present.

Members of the Evaluation Committee (Stu- .
dent Association office) and I welcome suggest-
ed improvements for the Evaluation from fac-
ulty or students; what would make it_ more use-

tul, more "accurate. less irritating, more effec-  

tive in general?

“Urban universities are going
to become increasingly places
where people work and learn
simultaneously,” Gow said.
“Education will become less of
a fulltime occupation; people
will merge careers with study.”

Gow also said that education
would be "much more individu-
ally based." and he looks for
widespread use’ of self-instruc-
tional material. particularly
instructional television.

A basic restructuring of the
education process is necessary.
feels Gow. due to the exorbi-
tant costs of that process and its
inability to meet the needs of
society.

Gow Foresees Worl§,Studies Merger

“The financial crisis of pri-
vate and public education is
not a temporary thing,” warned
Gow. “Education is tremendous-
ly, expensive and inefficient.
The trend is toward less produc-
tivity per teacher hour. The big
expense is personnel.”

In addition. Gow said. educa-
tion must be shaped to answer
the needs of society and the
community. "We must find
ways that society can support
education more prudently.“ he
said.

According to Gow. one of
those ways would be keeping
students in the mainstream of

society. rather than isolating
them on a campus for four
years. Education would become

more of a life-long process.

This notion runs counter to
the concept of "college as cru-
cible.“ a backdrop for hetero-
geneous ideas and people by
which students are socialized.
Gow called the "college as
crucible" concept a "myth"
and was eager to puncture it.

“That,” he said of the con-
cept, “is a lot of malarkey. So-

cietyp is the real crucible, the
other is an escape. I’m afraid
we have been perpetrating a
myth.”

Gow admits that none of these
changes will occur overnight.
He does feel. however. that the

to be in the vanguard of the
movement to a community-cen-
tered institution.

"We must respond to the new
educational needs of society
and the community." he said.
“General Studies can be more
flexible. It can incorporate al-
most anything into its curri-
culum."

Gow pointed to several pro-
grams of General Studies al-
ready in effect—an Administra-
tion of Justice course taught to
local policemen, a course taught
to some Westinghouse employ-
ees at the Westinghouse plant-
as examples of what he termed
“taking a.bit of the University
to the community.” Gow report-
ed that additional programs of
this nature would be developed.

One such program. slated for
implementation in the near fu-
ture. is use of the College Level
Education Program (CLEP) test.
These tests. administered to
prospective students out of
school for a number of years.

d Parenthood Counscls

Males On Contraception, VD

by MIKE MILLER

The Planned Parenthood Cen-
ter of Pittsburgh has designed a
unique program to provide a
source of information for men
in the area of sexuality.

The program. known as The
Male Session includes informa-
tion on contraception. vesecto—
my. rap sessions, counseling. and
venereal diseases information
and screening.

Low cost condoms are also
sold at sessions.

According to Susan Beery, a
Planned Parenthood spokesman,
condoms have fallen into disuse
as a result of wide-spread use of
female contraceptives, causing an
increase in venereal disease of
epidemic proportions.

The Male Session hopes to
combat this by encouraging the
use of condoms.

_ gram

“The program is aimed pri-
marily at the young. sexually
active guy who is probably not
married and possibly involved
with more than one girl." ex-
plained Beery.

The long-range goals of the pro-
include eliminating the
idea that contraception should
be left up to the female and
changing the prevelant attitude
that males have no responsibili-
ty in this area.

The Male Session was organ-
ized by Dr. Rose R. Middleman.
medical coordinator at Planned
Parenthood.

It consists of informal dis-
cussions among_ participants or
private conferences with a coun-
selor.

The all-male staff is composed
of volunteers. some of whom
are students in the Universitys

school of Public Health. in ad-
dition to a professional counsel-
or.

All volunteers are trained by
Planned Parenthood.

There are no papers to fill out
and all information is confiden-
tial. Clients are asked to give
their name. age and zip code for
statistical purposes. They may.
however. decline to give infor-
mation.

The Male Session, which be-

gan last February, has experien-
ced a slow start, but its organiz-
ers hope it will gain momentum
as more people become aware
of its existence.

The Male Session meets from
4:30 to 7:00 on Monday nights
on the Tenth floor of the Jack-
man Building at 526 Penn Ave-
nue.

Information can be obtained
by phoning Planned Parenthood
at 281-9502.

Posvar Dedicates

Litchfield Towers

by LORETTA HORRELL

What began as a thorough.
week long. clean-up program in
the Towers blossomed into the
erection of a podium. a massive
sea of chairs. and the sealing off
of Towers A and B f'rom the
main lobby. and ended with a
solemn dedication of the Towers.

Completed in 1963. the three
towers were formally dedicated
April 15 to Edward. H. Litch-
field. former chancellor (1955-
1965). Wesley W. Posvar. and
other speakers. addressed the au-
dience of meml%rs of the Litch-
t'ield family. members of the
Board of Trustees. and friends of
the University.

The dedication.
the Men‘s Dormitory Council
(MDC). was approved by the
Board of Trustees in October
1970. Chairman of the Board of
Trustees William Rea. in his
presentation address. cited the
appropriateness of dedicating
the towers to Litchfield. Rea sta-
ted that the Towers connote a
lofty vision.“ which was among
Litchfield’s many aspirations for
Pitt. .

Posvar, agreeing that the sta-
ture of the Towers was equal
the scope of Litchfield’s aspira-
tions for Pitt, stated that the
Towers stand as a monument to
Litchfield, for “the Towers are
a by-product of his administra-
tion. The towers fulfill one of his
many. dreams-—the creation of dor-
mitory space.”

Litchfield, said Posvar, was re-
sponsible for creating the schools
cosmopolitan style by purchasing
the Schenley apartments and
through the construction of the
towers. The dorms said the Chan-
cellor. have made it possible for
a vast array of students, out-
of-state and foreign. to attend
Pitt.

Litchfield‘s many accomplish-
ments were: for the faculty.

Famous US. Women Ski Team Diet

During the non-snow off season
the U.S. Women's Alpine Ski Team
members go on the “Ski Team“ diet
to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.
That’s right 20 pounds in 14 days!
The basis of the diet is chemical food
action and was devised by a famous
Colorado physician especially for the
U.S. Ski Team. Normal energy is
maintained (very important!) while
reducing. You keep “full” -- no
starvation — because the diet is de-
signed that way! lt’s a diet that is
easy to follow whether you work.
travel or stay at home.

This is, honestly. a fantastically
successful diet. If it weren‘t, the U.S.
Women‘s Ski Team wouldn't be per-
mitted to use it! Right? So, give
yourself the same break the U.S. Ski
Team gets. Lose weight the scientiﬁc.
proven way. Even if you've tried all
the other diets, you owe it to your-
self to try the U.S. Women‘s Ski
Team Diet. That is. if you really do
want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.

Order today. Tear this out as a
reminder.

Send only $l.00 ($1.25 for Rush
Service) cash is OK. - to: Ski

Team Diet. 279 Sheffield Dr.. Dept.
AX, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93103.
Don't order unless you expect to lose
20 pounds in two weeks! Because
that's what the SkiTeam Diet will do!

Muse, Niccols Sweep Grove City

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Despite the inability of Pan-
ther pitchers to loosen up. Pitt
romped over Grove City State
College in Tuesday’s double-
header at Trees Field by the
scores of 10-2 and 5-1.

Both Panther hurlers. Rich
Muse and Mike Niccols. felt
they "couldn't get loose in the
cold weather” and were there-
fore unable to give their best
performances.

Muse hurled a complete game
‘in the first of two against the
Grovers; this was his first win
of the season against one loss.

The Panther pitcher gave up
two runs, both earned, on eight
hits, none of which went for
extra bases. Muse fanned twelve

batters while only allowing
three base on balls.
Niccols.

second game. giving up one
run on four hits. The right
hander str.ck out six and walk-
ed only one. Mike Fedoris re-
lieved Niccols in the seventh.

“I didn’t take Mike out be-
cause he wasn’t doing well."
explained Coach Bobby Lewis.
“I just wanted to get some
pinch hitters in and also to get
Fedoris to pitch a little.“

In the first game Grove
City drove in their two runs in
the fourth inning on singles by
Jack MacKert, Steve Oliver,
and Greg Port.

The fourth inning was also
the beginning of the Panthers
ten run seige. Leftfielder Dennis
Toboz started the inning off by
reaching first base on an error
and subsequently crossed home
plate on a single by team cap-
tain Bob Solonickne and a two
base error by the rightfielder.

°On the Run’ In 9-0

by JAN FRY

For the second straight year
Penn State crushed the Pitt
tennis team 9-0 and the Pan-
thers just might start taking up,
jogging after the Nittany Lions
had them running around the
courts on Tuesday.

“I have the team run around
the football field every day to
get in shape." explained Penn
State Coach Holmes Cathrall.
"That’s why they can run like
they do."

Pllt Junior Gary Schwartz
explained his loss in number
one singles to Shivar Walker
6-0, 6-0 by saying “he just got
the points where he needed
them. I served to his back hand
but he was good enough to turn
them back.” Schwartz further
explained, “I need more prac-
tice. He was a tough player
losing only one out of eight this
season.”

In number two singles fresh-
man Bill Wood‘s opponent had
_him as he described it “really
reeling. I got my butt whopped.“

"He's the best guy

. I've played this year. I had

trouble with my first serves

and was hitting low.“ Wood
lost 6-1. 6-2.

Letterman Mike O'Loughlin

dropped number three singles
6-0. 6-2" to a player on the
best team in the big four.“
O’Loughlin explained that he
was really out of practice and

iWhiteWashing Tuesday

that this also contributed to his
loss.

“ES Increible La 'Manera en
que juega. tenis- muy beune,”
muttered Jorge Guttierrez after
his 6-0, 6-0 loss in fourth singles.
“My game has come back but
my opponent was incredible - un-
believable in the way he play-
ed.”‘

States Al Umana last year and

boz and a three run blast by
first baseman Ken Macha over
the center field fence.

“Our hitting was pretty good."
stated Lewis. "Macha‘s hitting
real well and Livingston's a real
surprise. His hitting is good
and he's playing well.”

The mitters began the second
contest with a quick two runs
in the first inning. Toboz
singled and shortstop Terry
Stokes followed with a walk.
With two gone in the inning.
Solonickne walked. loading the
bases. Livingston followed with
a single which produced the
two runs.

The Panthers picked up an-
other run in the third and two
in the fifth. In the fifth, Stokes‘
doubled to left center field and
advanced to third on an error.
Macha walked and then stole
second. Solonickne hammered
out a triple, scoring the two
runners.

The Grovers scored their
lone run on a triple in the
Fourth by Oliver and a sacri-

fice fly.

Richey, Salter Gone:

by VINCE DiNARDO

A lot happened to the Pitt track team. while
most students were enjoying the recent semester
break. Although. not everything that happened
was pleasant. the tracksters spent most of the
time savoring their eight first place wins in the
West Virginia Relays and also some fine per-
formances in both the Penn and Drake Relays.

This spring saw an ECAC (Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Conference) ruling bring an abrupt end
to the Pitt track careers of Jerry Richey and Bry-
ant Salter. The Conference ruled that both Richey
and Salter were eneligible this spring because
of their participation in the spring of their fresh-
man years.

Both athletes. according to their coach Jim
Banner. had a good chance to make it to the
Olympics that year .and it was worth a try on
their part. '

At that time, only three years of eligibility
was allowed to an athlete. Ironically, a few
months later, the Conference extended eligibility
to four years, but the decision was not retroac-
tive and therefore Richey and Salter were not

awarded their fourth year. *"

Salter. drafted by the San Diego Charger
Football team. proceeded to their rookie camp.
and Richey. stripped of his Pitt uniform and un-
decided about the 1972 Olympics, continued run-
ning in open event.

Richey. a full-time husband. and part-time
runner and cab driver. continued wearing blue and
gold uniforms-——minus the Pitt insignia-—while try-
ing to make up his mind about the ‘72 Olympics.

“I’ll have to decide whether they (the Olym-
pics) are worth another year of training,” he said
earlier this year. Now, since Pitt cannot pay his
way any longer, the decision will be tougher for
Richey to make.

Richey. who has just been named on two All-
American teams. took the decision in stride.

"I was surprised.“ Said Richey of the decision.
“I was down for a couple of days.“ To compli-
cate things more. the Olympic contender suffer-
ed a knee injury in a fall but seems fully recov-
ered.

Banner, who had an inkling of his two ath-
letes ineligibility, regrets to see the departure
of his two stars.

“I didn‘t want to see them go." he said. “but
at least they got their three years in. "

Just as it seemed that there would be a void
on the team. other athletes stepped in and filled
it.

Bill Rea, still a freshman, filled in quite ade-

quately for Bryant Salter. In his two appearances

Tracksters Manage To
A Win Without Big Stars

PITT TEAM captain, right fielder Bob Solonickne, helped to lead
the Panther mititers to a double win over Grove City. Solonickne
went 3-7 in Tuesday's doubleheader.

in the triple jump, Rea jumped 48 feet and

45 feet respectively. The qualifying distance in
the nationals is 52 feet in the triple jump.

Can Rea let Banner forget all about Bryant
Salter?

“I don't think anybody will ever forget Bryant."
Banner quickly answered.

Dan Kouvolo, who wants to be one of the
three best javelin throwers in the country, won
his first three meets, before bowing to Frank
Murro of Arizona, the best.

Fine performances were also turned in by .

Steve Hein in West Virginia and in the Penn Re-
lays. Dave Chesebourough in Penn. the mile re-
lay team also in the Penn relays. and the Two-
Mile relay team at the Drake Relays.

The mile relay
team. which Ban- 
ner expects to see
run 3:10 this
spring. ran 3215.2
‘at Penn and seems
well on their way
to achieving that
goal.

The two-mile re-
lay team, despite a
fifth place finish,
broke the old Pitt
record by a whop-
ping eight seconds
jnd left Banner
very please. Their
run can be appre-
ciated more when
it is compared to
Villanova’s win-
ning time in the
Penn Relays.

The Wildcats ran
a 7125.5 in their
race. while the Pitt tracksters ran 7 226.6.

The tracksters will now prepare for the Big Four
meet this weekend at Penn State. Penn State. Syra-
cuse. and West Virginia. along with Pitt will con-
stitute the meet. Pitt usually dominates the action
in this meet and with the athletes that will go this
year. there is no reason why Pitt shouldn‘t contin--
ue to do so.

BRYANT SALTER
Turns to Football

Smittie Brown. Dorel Watley. Mike Shurko. Dave
Szabat. David Cheseborough. Steve Hein and John
Aiken will all make the trip to Penn State.

But. there seem to be two names missing from
the lineup. _

Looking Ahead

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

With high school graduation only a month away for
most schools. its the season for college coaches to scramble
for top prospects in the recruiting wars. In the past several
weeks. Pitt coaches have landed a few prime schoolboy
athletes. while also watching several ballplayers choose ri-
val universities.

Coach Carl DePasqua has filled the football quota of
24 scholarships for next seasons Cubs. Included in the
group are two gridders that were named to the Big 33
squad.

Presently. Coach Buzz Ridl has secured the signature
of only one future Panther cager. 6-4 forward Kirk Bruce
of South Hills High. Bruce. noted for his ‘ ‘
shooting ability, was a member of the West _
Penn team in the Roundball Classic. p

Dave Adams. who has achieved a re- "
markable recruiting record since his ap-
pointment as wrestling coach. chalked up
another local talent to his tally. George Bry-
ant. WPIAL and State Champ at 112 pounds.
will bolster next years matmen.

One athlete that ‘got away‘ was Tom Clements. a three
sport star at Canevin High School. Clements. one of~the
most sought after highschoolers in Western Pennsylvania.
had narrowed his pick to Pitt. Notre Dame. and North Car-
olina. Actually. his final choice hinged upon his decision
for which sport he preferred. and the Fighting Irish won
his services for the next four years on the gridiron.

For the first time in the history of the Tri-State Base-
ball Coaches Association. a two division league has been
arranged between the member clubs. The organization.
headed by Point Park Coach Frank Gustine and Panther
mentor Bobby Lewis, placed Pitt in the northern division
along with seven other area schools. The Southerners in-
clude West Virginia and Duquesne.

Unfortunately. the basketball game scheduled against
South Carolina in December. will be after the fall term
has ended and a number of the students are not in Pitts-
burgh. This will mark the second meeting in Panther cage
history with the (Jiamecocks. as the Southerners won the
only other battle.

This contest was substituted for Cornell which with-
drew from its coinmittment because of a change in its aca-
demic schedule. It completes the Panthers home card while
only one away game remains to be filled.

With the addition of the Gamecocks. the Panthers have
increased their number of Southern rivals to five, plus the
possibility of meeting Wake Forest in the Steel Bowl.

—— Congratulations to former Panther basketballer Billv
I)ownes who was recently named as an alternate winner
to an .\'C.-\A Postgraduate Scholarship.

for the Panther shutout. and he
has compiled a 6-0 mark. His
earned run average through 39
innings is a phenomenal 0.69.

Coach Bobby Lewis of the
Panthers expects that Wagener
will again be the starting pitch-
er for WVI7. “Either Kim West
or Randy Lease will pitch
against us in the second game.“
Lewis predicted.

Lewis plans to send Albie
Sylanski against the .\lounlain—
eers in the first game. while

either .\Iike .\'iccols. Rich .\Iuse.
or Mike Fedoris will pitch in the
nightcap.

“I definitely think that we'll
have a better chance against
them this time.“ said Lewis.
“The last time out they just
threw the ball by us because we
didn't have much hitting prac-
tice.”

Over the semester break. the
diamondmen won five games
while dropping just one. Three
contests were cancelled due to
inclement weather.

Against Steubenville. the squad
romped to two victories. 11-0
and 7-0 behind the strong pitch-
ing of Niccols and Fedoris.

In their first single game of
the ‘'71 campaign. the mitters
knocked off Bucknell 6-2 to
avenge last year's ninth inning
defeat to the Bisons.

Frank Mincarelli pitched four
innings before running into trou-
ble by loading the bases. Fresli-
man Bill Shamott_.pitched out of
the jam and finished the game
to pick up the win.

the Panthers two 9-0 wins be-
cause of the forfeits.

"We held them to the contract

On Saturday. the Buffalo squad

City and Mike Schurko of Beth-
al Park. Pa.

The team captured the worlds
record in the medley relay event
while competing at the Delaware
Invitational track meet in early
March. Their time was a sizz-
ling 9227.7. Ironically. the team

Smitty Brown was in Watley‘s
place. and the week after Dela-
ware. Dennis Schatzman ran the
race. John Aiken also ran in place
of Silay.

Track Coach Jim Banner was
very pleased with the results of
the voting. “I'm very happy.“ he
commented. “They’re a fine
bunch of athletes.“

In the record setting race. Wat-
ley ran the 440. Siley. the half
mile Schurko the 3/4 mile. Richey
anchored the team in the mile.

Richey. a graduate of Pitts-
burgh‘s North Allegheny High
School. is no longer eligible to
compete for the Panthers. since
he began running for Pitt in the
spring before his freshman year.
In the four years that he has
been at the school. Richey has
been named to cross country and
indoor track All-American
squads. One year ago he came in
first at the NCAA finals. win-
ning the two-mile event.

For Silay. Watley. and Churko.
it was their first All-American
recognition.

Linksmen Await Big Four

After Early Season Wins;

Coach Highly Optimistic

The Pitt linksmen are off to
their best start in seasons. alrea-
dy bettering their 1970 record of
3-3-1. On their way to a present

3-2 standing. the golfers have de--

feated Bucknell and Clarion in
stroke play. 395 398 and 388 403.
respectively. and Duquesne in
match play. 20-1.

The golfers‘ only losses have
been to West Virginia. 5-2. in
the season opener. and Indiana.
403-388.

The big match that the golfers
have been waiting for is the Big
4 at Penn State on May 1 with
Syracuse. West Virginia and the
Nittany Lions.

Links coach Rex Peery related,
“I think we should do okay. We

have three good shooters and the
other boys are coming around.”

Even considering the loss to
West Virginia and how strong
he feels Penn State is. Peery is
still optimistic. "We should fin-
ish second." he says.

By all indications, Pitt may
have to scramble to finish sec-
ond. The strongest team at the
present appears to be Penn State
with five returning letterman.

Top man for the Nittany Lions
is team captain and two-time
letter winner Nick Raasch. who
posted a 7-2 record last year. He
is joined by seniors Fred Schultz
and Mike McDonnell and jun-

16 _vears. their 1970 Man-of—the-

In naming Coach Peery as
their Man-of-the-year, the Fed-

a coach. Peery stepped down
from the Pitt head coaching po-
sition in 1965, dropping out of
the wrestling arena. He now
serves as the Panther golf coach
and he continues to teach on the
Physical Education staff.

ed in Stillwater after gradua-

tion to wrestle for the "leg-
endary Ed Gallagher. the fath-
er of amateur wrestling.” com-
mented the federation. "He
learned his lessons well. He was
NCAA National Champion three
times. 1933. 1934. and 1935 - at
118 pounds. He was undefeated
in dual matches."

During his 14 years of coach-
ing wrestling in high schools in
Oklahoma. Peery‘s teams won
four State Championships. He
then moved on to Pitt where he
re-introduced the sport.

“Although losing every match
in 1950 - his first year- from then
on it was nothing but success,”
commented the federation. His
15 year record, after that first
season, was a remarkable 116-
33-2. A victory streak of 26
straight highlighted this stretch.

Peery guided Pitt to second-
place finishes in the NCAA
Championships in 1954 and
1957. They ‘placed third in 1955
and 1956. The 1957 team had

three individual NCAA Cham-
pions.
Thirteen NCAA Champion-

ships and 23 Eastern Collegiate
Championships is a good indi-
cation of the skill Peery had in
developing individual wrestlers.

Camaro Ready For ..;
Bridgehampton Race 

n-; - ’ - - -.

by GEARY JOHNS

The first supreme test of the spring racing circuit for the Pitt
Camaro ended before it actually began.

‘The Camaro was ‘scheduled to open the season at the Summit
Point race in West Virginia held on Ap_ril 18. However. Bob Fryer.

driver of the sports car. stated.
the race."

It seems that during the final
engine check before departing
for the race. the “Pitt Crew“
found that the spark plugs were
leaking air. which causes zero
compression in the engine.

However, last weekend, April
24, Bob Fryer and the crew ran
the car through the Skid Pad,
a portable auto testing device.
As Fryer said, “We had hoped to
find any other defects in‘ the en-
gine and to perfect the handling
of the car.”

From the pad they proceeded
to the Warren. Ohio Sports Car
Track. There they ran the Ca-
maro through various racing con-
ditions. such as cornering at high
speeds. handling of the car. and
braking from high speeds.

With these tests completed the
racing team has stocked their
ten-man camper and entered the
Bridgehampton Nationals in
Bridgehampton. New York.

Instead of returning home fol-
lowing the‘ race, they will pro-
ceed to neighboring Limerock,

You can afford it while
you’re still young enough to

Having the want is one thing. Having the
wherewithal is another. The trouble with being
young is that all too often you have the one
without the other.

But the 1971 MG Midget is something else again.
Here is a true sports car for under $2500*—
the lowest price you can pay for the real thing.

In this case the real thing includes a race-
winning .1275 c.c. engine. Racing-type rack—and-
pinion steering (2.33 turns lock to lock) for cool,
crisp driving. Heavy—duty suspension for

superb road—hugging. Disc brakes up front for
straight-line, non—fade stops. Twin reclining
bucket seats. And full sports car instrumentation
with an electric tach.

Which only goes to show that, even though MG
has been engineering sports cars for over 40
years, there’s no generation gap. For the name
