Council Will Receive

  $475 Appropriation

Glasser Elected To Replace
Prince As Secretary;
Discuss Projects

Men’s Council will receive a Uni-
versity appropriation of $475, it was
announced at Council’s ﬁrst meeting
of the year late yesterday afternoon.

To replace Robert Price, C38, who
is now a student at Stanford, John
Glasser, BA38, was elected secretary
by a close vote.

A report on customs by Paul Jen-
nings, C38, and Louis Bearer, E37,
chairmen, indicated that this project
is running smoothly. Customs exams
will be held for freshmen next week,
with engineers taking theirs Tuesday.

Upon the suggestion of N. Robert
Seidle, assistant to the dean of men
and adviser to Men’s Council, a reso-
lution was passed, to be forwarded
to the department of building and
grounds, that an ampliﬁer system be
placed in the oﬁice of the dean of
men, in order to indicate to those in
Room 801, Cathedral, that classes are
over or beginning.

Projects which were considered in-
cluded an extension of the customs
program to include men transfer stu-
dents, the projected men’s student
loan fund, and a directory to include
the names and addresses of all men
students. All these met with the ap-
proval of the council. A committee
was appointed, with Chalmers Brown,
Ed37, as chairman, to study the prob-
lem of transfer students and to act
upon plans thus formulated without
obtaining the approval of Men’s
Council.

Ben Baskin, C37, as president of
the undergraduate Cap and Gown
Club, appointed William Blum, C38,
as chairman of the dance. Now
Blum, dance chairman, reverses the
tables by appointing Baskin as pub-
licity manager.

John Downie, BA39, will be busi-
ness manager for the dance. ‘Oth-
ers on the committee are: D. C.
Schultz, BA38; Leo Griﬂiths, C39;
Francis Durkin, BA39; Albert Kairys,

A meeting will be held today at
3:30 o’clock in Room 821, Cathedral.
This dance, the ﬁrst University af-
fair sponsored by Cap and Gowners
in four years, marks the opening of
a series of social events to be held
by the undergraduate club.

Y To Hold

Annual Fry
On Tuesday

Sports, Talks, ‘Refreshments
To Be Had At Y Frolic
In Schenley Park

University students who attend the
annual Fall Friendship Fry, to be held
next Tuesday afternoon in Schenley
Park, will have a chance to do every-
thing from batting a mushball over
the Oval stables to getting sick on
hot dogs and ice cream prepared by
the culinary efforts of YWCA coun-
cil members.

The fry, sponsored jointly by the
University YM and YWCA, will mark
the ﬁrst association meeting of the
two groups and will be headed by
Co—Chairmen Dorothy Kerr, Ed38,
president of the YWCA, and Charles
Smullin, C38, member of the YMCA
cabinet.

Something of an institution on the
University campus, this year’s fry will
present sporting events, talks and dis-
cussions, and the picnic supper. The
event will begin at 4:30 o’clock at one
of the park shelter houses and will
end when all the food is eaten.

Leaders assert the fry will be over
in time to allow the participants to
attend the annual Intersectarian
Church Night, to be held in the Hotel
Schenley ballroom. Prominent leaders
in ecclesiastical and scholastic circles
will speak, and entertainment will be
furnished by various units from the
city colleges and universities.

Assisting Miss Kerr are: Grace At-
kinson, Ed37; Elsie De Luca, Ed37;
Betty Feick, Ed38; Mildred Frey,
C37; Margaret Kahler, C39; Sophia
Nelson, Ed38; Juniata Steele, Ed38;
Helen Weisman, Ed38; Ruth Rylan-
der, Ed37; Julia Swisdak, Ed38, and
Lillian Halenda, Ed38.

Green Armbands
Will Be Removed
For Blue, Gold

Green armbands will disappear
from the campus as freshman women
take their customs examination on
Thursday and Friday, October 1 and
2, from 8:30 to 5:30 o’clock at
Heinz House.

In their place will be the blue and
gold armbands which each freshman
woman will receive after passing the
customs tests. Results of the exams,
and blue armbands may be obtained
Monday at Heinz House.

Freshmen are required to have a
knowledge of the history of the Uni-
versity, to know at least three songs,
cheers, and the chant; to be able to
name WSGA by-laws, oﬂicers of
the administration of the Univer-
sity, and members of the Customs
Committee. The other requirements
for the Customs tests are given in
the freshman handbook.

Customs members held a Com-
munity Sing at Heinz House on Mon-
day to aid the freshman women in

learning the University songs.

YES, AGAIN!

Those Identiﬁcation Pictures

Have To Be Produced

 

All University events at which stu-
dent books are required for admis-
sion, will now also require presenta-
tion of student identiﬁcation cards,
according to John Weber, secretary
and business manager of the Uni-
versity. The new cards include pho-
tographs of students taken as part of
the registration procedure.

Following the lead set by the “Big
Ten” Conference, the use of the
cards will put an end to the suspected
traffic in books, which has permitted
little brothers and distant cousins to
attend big school events under the
guise of students.

These cards will probably be dis-
tributed to all students during the
week of October 5. A more detailed
announcement will appear at a later
date.

The cards are in the nature of an
experiment, being tri-ed here for the
ﬁrst time. According to present
plans, new photographs will be taken
each year.

Late Friday afternoon the SFA
committee will recommend to the Ex-
ecutive committee four or ﬁve out-
standing sophomores as candidates
for leading positions on the Soph
Hop committee.

The unprecedented number of peti-
tions which on Monday, the ﬁrst day
of application, reached 35, has al-
ready exceeded the total number of
last year.

Five o’clock this evening is the
deadline for the return of the peti-
tions. Interviews with the Appoint-
ments Committee, of which David Ra-
cusin, C37, is chairman; Robert
Churchill, C37; Mary Lou Dowling,

Beatless Reporter Interviews
All And Sundry About
Summer Holidays

By Shorty Long

As it is a tradition around these
parts of the woods (or the News
oﬂice) for some inspired soul to wan-
der around under the appellation of
the Inquiring Reporter or Beatless
Reporter No. 001111117 and collect
information about things in general,
it now behooves us to take up the
ﬂaming torch and discover where peo-
ple went on their vacations.

Sally Brunson gave the Army a
treat by Sallying around the environs
of West Point. Ed Springer was
also there, but did not Sally around.
Way down South (even below Mt.
Washington) wandered Bob Culbert-
son, who Bojangled in South Amer-
ica. Harvey Goldstein and Dave Ra-
cusin had great fun at Virginia
Beach.

Present at the Olympic Games in
Germany was a lengthy young man
named Johnny Woodruﬂ’, who pressed
on to conquer all the nations in the
800-metre race. Another representa-
tive of Connellsville is Herb Rackolf,
who stayed there and played golf.

He would have shot the course in an

on the 18th hole. Sad case!
Tommy Smith visited his old home-
stead in the same metropolis and
happened to meet Ben, who was Bas-
kin in Atlantic City. Lea Goldstein
was also tucked away in Atlantic
City enjoying the ocean, and Rose
Nugent dilly-dallied in Ocean City.

to give up.

A lengthy way to vacation was dis-
covered by Sidney Shore. He Sid

seekers strewn about those parts. At
Geneva were Charlotte Atwell, Mar-

Jean Barnes, a most stable charac-
ter (Hay, hay!), and June Greene,
Lucy Conn and their sister swim-
mers.
Then There Was Canada

Among those whipping around our
“friendly neighbor,” Canada, was
Jock Ballantyne, who was in Toronto,

Pitt Football To Be Booted
From -Stage Of Grotto
At Kick-off Dance

An All— College Association
eleven of co—eds Will take over
the stage of the Grotto ballroom,
Friday evening, and, directed by
Coach Charles Rogers, ’37, will
proceed to open the 1936-37
dance season.

This was decided at the ﬁrst Col-
lege Association Cabinet meeting,
Monday evening, when ﬁnal plans for
the annual “Kick-off” informal were
completed.

Rose Nugent, ’38, was the young
lady designated by the Cabinet of 15
members to kick the ball from the
Grotto stage to the tunes of Bob
Fredette and his band. As quarter-
back of the All-Beauty eleven, she is
reported to be engaged in secret prac-
tice and to be outdistancing even the
best boots of Tony Matisi, C38, var-
sity tackle.

Ball To Be Autographed

The football, one that Jimmy Ha-
gan, graduate manager of athletics
and former varsity halfback, had
tucked away for the Notre Dame
game, will be autographed by every
member of the varsity footballteam.

Fraternity scouts report that one
Greek outﬁt has already worked out
a new ﬂying wedge that “just can’t
fail to bring the ball to the house.”

Bob Fredette’s orchestra will be
the ﬁrst national outﬁt to play for a
College Association affair. The $1.00
per couple CA policy, traditionally
the lowest priced dance series on the
University social calendar, will be in
effect for this event.

This will be Fredette’s ﬁrst appear-
ance in the Pittsburgh district; he has
appeared, however, in virtually every
large city in the United States and
Canada, and is a favorite in the East-
ern seaboard resorts. His list of en-
gagements includes such spots as the
Steel Pier in Atlantic City, the Am-
bassador Hotel in New York, and the
Totem Pole, Boston hot spot.

Added to the CA Cabinet yester-
day were David Grossman, ’38, and
Marion Wollett, ’40. The dance, ﬁrst
of a series of four which the associa-
tion sponsors every year, begins at
the Grotto at 9 o’clock Friday eve-
ning. Tickets at $1.00 may be pur-
chased from any member of the Kick-
Off committee, the CA cabinet, or at
the College office in State Hall.

Deadline For Scripts
Set Back Two Weeks

Students writing scripts for the
1937 Cap and Gown Club show will
have a little more time to polish up
their gags and heighten their situa-
tions.

In deference to the wishes of sev-
eral prospective script submitters,
the production committee of the
Graduate Club at a meeting Monday
evening decided to extend the dead-
line from October 1 to Monday,
October 12. Musicians and lyricists
will have until the end of October to
enter their efforts.

So far, two books are known to be

the process of completion, accord-
ing to Theodore W. Biddle, secretary
-of the Graduate club. The authors
of last year’s book, Nick Spanos,
C38, and Robert Saffron, C38, have
written another, tentatively titled
“You Have to Sell the Women.”
Sydney Shore, C38, and William
Colker, C39, are collaborating on a
satire called “The Cat’s Meow.”

Any other students working on a
book are asked to tell Mr. Biddle
about it.

With preparations for the ﬁrst de-
bate of the season with Western Re-
serve University nearing completion,
the varsity debaters will gather for
their initial meeting this afternoon
during the ﬁfth hour in Room 308,
Alumni Hall.

Some 35 forensic aspirants will be

University Increases Six
And One—Half Per Cent
For Fall Semester

Enrollment at the University for
the fall semester exceeds that of the
corresponding period last year by six
and one-half per cent, according to
ﬁgures released by J. G. Quick, Uni-
versity registrar, yesterday.

Registration in un dergraduate
schools is up four per cent; that in
graduate schools and the evening and
Saturday division shows an increase
of more than three per cent, while
that in the various extension divi-
sions, including Johnstown and Erie,
has increased eight per cent.

Mr. Quick points out that the in-
creased enrollment in the undergrad-
uate schools is most marked in the
schools of business administration,
engineering and mines. The evening
and Saturday divisions of the Uni-
versity boast 487 more students for
the ﬁrst semester. The increase in
the J ohnstown and Erie branches, al-
though considerable, is not so marked.
The registration mark of the two
divisions is 380, as compared with 347
for the ﬁrst semester of last year.

Additional late registrations are
coming in, especially in the 22 ex-
tension branches of the University.

Total registration for the year, in-
cluding additional registrants for the
second semester and students in the
various summer sessions, will, ac-
cording to Mr. Quick, probably ex-
ceed last year’s by a considerable
margin.

Research Review
Reveals Marked
Business Spurt

Business Bureau Magazine
Discusses Employment,
Production Gains

Optimistic ﬁgures on many angles
of business activity are printed in
the September edition of the Pitts-
burgh Business Review, published by
the Bureau of Business Research of
the University, which was released
yesterday.

Business in the Pittsburgh district,
according to the Review, moved into
new high ground in August. During
the month, the index of business ac-
tivity reached 93.5, a gain of 1.1
from the preceding month.

The magazine also notes a substan-
tial increase in the volume of pro-
duction in the district, the adjusted
index advancing from 94.8 in July
to 97.2 in August. This compares
with an index of 67.7 in August of
last year and 47.9 in August, 1934.

Approximately the same number
of people were employed by ﬁrms in
the district in August as in July, the
publication reports. “Nevertheless,”
it continues, “about 13 per cent more
of the workers in the district had
jobs in August than in August of
last year, and they received nearly
30 per cent more in wages.”

The bulletin also contains some
points of view on the employment in-
surance provisions of the Social Se-
curity Act.

Emcee Rebuttal

WE UNDERSTAND Men’s Council met for the ﬁrst time yes-

terday. We also understand from reliable sources that the
idea behind the “Little Man, What Now?” dissertation last week
was not clear. The answer to the latter could very conveniently
be dumped on the shoulders of a rip-roarin’ Panther that later
all but tore the goal posts from their Stadium moorings. This
action, however, would have made Mr. Mecca quite angry, and
might possibly have slowed up the Pitt touchdown marches. But
you see, the little rascal, the Panther, we mean, was in our hair
last week, and when that happens things like Men’s Council and
lollypops make us feel very loose-like.

Many asked just what did it mean. It meant precisely that
Men’s Council at that time appeared to be excess baggage, an at-
tempt to make every man a campus key man. Men’s Customs is
great, both for the freshmen and upperclassmen. But does it
need an intricate piece of machinery to make it function efficient-
ly? Is it asking too much of SFA to suggest that it continue what
was perhaps its biggest single feat of 1935-36? Dance appoint-
ments should be the least important concern of SFA. Things
like Men’s Customs are fast balls right down the alley of a stu-
dent government, balls that usually produce strikes, instead of
spares or splits.

As For The.. ..

prospective loan fund project, we might say that at the present
time there is at least one fundof this kind on campus available
to students for loans at no interest rate. That fund has yet to be
tapped to the ﬁnal dollar. Incidentally, it is open to all University
students.

It is not expedient to have machinery, traditions, constitutions,
when there is a similar set of machinery, traditions, and constitu-
tions to do the work. There are many things to be done by a
student government, but the big fault at the present time with the

THE PITT NEWS

SFA governing group is its unwieldiness and bulk, _its factional
dissension, and its faulty focus on relatively un°-important things.
and lack of focus on the seemingly small (nationally), but really
important student problems that we will forget so soon after the
fourth___]une has passed, but which could make the stay so much
nicer. P W_hy, then, add. to the _unwieldiness, the bulk, the con-
fusion by further separating the functions of a ‘student govern-

ment?

  PITTPOUIIRI

By Ben Baskln
Riposte ‘ .. ,

It seems that Bill Arthur (commerce prof) had a lass in one of his
‘advertising classes to whom he gave a C for her ﬁrst semester's work.
She gave up the course in day sessions and one evening Bill met her down
town in the evening school classes. His opening remarks were, “Hello,
Miss .” Her’s were, “What the h was the idea of giving me
a C in that adv. course? Why any moron could have made a C grade.”
Bill came back with, “Well, that's what I gave you.” p. s. . . . she left in
a huff . . . .

Smart Money

Ohio State money is being offered at 10-6 on the fracas scheduled for
October 10 . . . better gobble some of this up . . . we understand that
some of. the Ohio State alums here in town are proffering 2-1 . . . but we
couldn't ﬁnd any bets . . . incidentally, we were talking to Dalle Tezze
about the game and Dante says that he will either be broke the rest of
. he adds that he anticipates living like
the boys left Webster Hall in a

the year or live like a king . .
the latter . .
messy shape . . .

. apropos of football . . .

Campus Comment

Heine Hassl-er and Bob Baughman fell puhlenty hard for the Illinois
beauty queen they met last Friday nite . . . she also poses for the Chicago
Tribune . . . Emily Sneddon is feeling rather lonely now that Andy Barch-

, ﬁeld is at W. & J. . . . Bob Culbertson is attempting the rhumba at all the

local nite spots due to his ﬁesta spent in South America this past summer
-o-n board a freighter . . . We note in passing that Bill Grosscope has a lovely
glimmer (black eye) . . . Bill claims it was a swinging door . . . Why does
Harvey Goldstein allus say “Happy Pitching” to Jean Lawson ‘.7 ? ? the
connotation is rather vague as we know Jean is not a diamond star . . .

To The Pitt Panther (not the comic magazine)

Herewith is offered an apology for the Panther’s gyrations during
Saturday's game . . . we understand that the costume is so designed that
it is practically impossible to hear anything from the inside of the pelt
. so we presume that the Panther didn't know what was going on . . .
we also suggest that holes be made in the headpiece to allow better

acoustics . . .

Snaps

We saw Chuck Allcroft at Saturday’s game chewing over old times
with Bill Daufenbach . . . and also noticed that H.N.G. has passed on
his fraternity pin . . . Dick Matesic and Vin Sites, former Panther stars,
grabbed a likely piece of glory for themselves in Sunday’s pro victory over
the N. Y. Giants . . . Who was the veddy cute PCW lass that was at Friday’s
hop who rammed a car on Forbes near Thackeray ? ? ? speaking of PCW
who were the three gals, that barged into a Dithridge St. fraternity
Who" does Bud Lewis phone
down in Norfolk, Virginia every Monday night ? ? ?

Prediction

Sol Cohen, Phi Ep, and a certain former Ohio State miss are very
serious about the fatal step . . . she lives in Uniontown and‘ dropped out
of school so that she could be closer to Sol . . . he phones her every
night . . . we are making a book and offering 2-1 odds that Sol will

make her a Mrs. by June . . .

Open Letter To The Thetas:

Dear gals: Despite your thinking the contrary, I still contend that I
know where your shingle is . . . p. s. . . . it's not under the Tri-Delt
porch . . . what’s your offer? I

Pitt In Hollywood V
Stanley Bergerman, Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, Calif., has asked Carl
. . he's look-

ing for some campus talent that he can spot in the movies . .

Cass, Pitt Players’ coach, for prospective cinematic stars. .

interested better see Mr. Cass in a hurry . . .

Letters To
Editors __

Editor, The Pitt News: '
As a leader of undergraduate opin-
ion it is your privilege t0 fully ex‘
press in your editorial pages all Such
views of campus activities as you see
ﬁt, However, in view of your most
recent editorial, “Little Man What
Now?,” in which you strongly Q1195‘
tion Men’s Council’s worth as a use-
ful organization, I feel that in all
fairness to that organization I must
show that your opinions are mis-

guided and unfair.

It is not my idea, tlmllgll» When
writing this letter, to expect a cessa-
tion of your ridicule nor to expect a
more charitable attitude towards
Men’s Council. But rather, I shall
expect from you a fairly c0I1g1‘_u°l1S
and deﬁnite analysis of the shortcom-
ings of Council which as yet has not
had the opportunity to launch a pro-
gram nor to justify its existence. It
will, no doubt, require many add?
tional subtleties to explain why in
our week at school this semester we
have not established a list of tradi-
tions, nor revised our Constitution to
suit our needs, nor set up a men’s
loan fund.

1 will expect you to make known
in concrete terms why you believe
Men’s Council cannot justify itself in
face of the fact that last year’s As-
sembly of SFA was of the over-
whelming opinion that a men’s gov-
erning body was sorely needed on the
campus. _ .

As to your personal opinions re-
garding the qualiﬁcations of the per-
sonnel of Council, I expect no expla-
nations; for the record of each mem-
ber is well known and tells the
“score.” _

You admit a customs program is
essential here at the University. But
tirading against “a few Pledges on
the sidelines indiiferently mumbling
strange signals” is not constructive
and does not make for customs co-
operation among the Freshmen.

If you are of the opinion that the
basic theory of the customs program
as now carried out is too lax, I invite
your concrete suggestions to the
Council’s Customs Committee which
will improve the administration of
Customs.

Whether or not raising the funds
necessary to start an adequate loan
fund will constitute a walkover with
Fifth Avenue or Apollo remains to
be seen. If, after carefully recon-
sidering the matter, you are still of
this opinion, the Student Loan Com-
mittee would appreciate it greatly
were you to share this exceptional ﬁ-
nancial ability with which such an
opinion necessarily goes.

Very sincerely yours,
Florian C. Majchrzak,
President, Men’s Council

Weak Spots Shown
In Panther Opener

Sutherland Drills Squad On Defense, Fumblitis, Pass
Receiving, In Preparation For West Virginia;
Players To See Moving Pictures Tonight

While most of th-e ﬁrst reports of
the Panther 53-0 crush of Ohio Wes-
leyan’s Bishops last Saturday con-
tained the words “power,” “sensa-
tiona,” and a few hundre-d other
ﬂowery phrases, Dr. Jock Sutherland
had several different ideas in mind
when his varsity» squad met Monday
and Tuesday for practice. . -

Jock could ﬁnd m-ore flaws In 1115
team’s deb-ut than a sailors pa1‘I_‘0E
has cuss-words. There was the po-in
about the four fumbles. Ano-th-er
point concerning the two droPP_ed
touchdown passes and still a third
in the numerous Panther Pena1t1e5-
Accordingly, while Mr. S-utherland
appreciated the huge Score and all
the Panthers rolled up, there are Still
quite a number of things to be ironed
out, aside from their .I€1_'SeYS, b§3f°1‘e
the Golden Cats can mingle with a
certain Ohio team or a speciﬁc In-
diana eleven.

Goldberg was the greatest offender
to both teams. ‘FIIT-St, he rubbed
things into the Ohio Wesleyan team
with two 20-yard runs, a touchdown,
a 76-yard jaunt, and another touch-
down. Sometime later, Marshall
turned on his team-mates and drop-
ped two touchdown-headed balls,
which helped the Bishops keep the
score down to 53. _

Then there was Fabian Hoffman;
the substitute end. Hoffman is usu-
ally a good pass receiver, b-ut on
Saturday the Bishops must have
prayed the b-all right out of his hands

for he dropped two very neat throws.
One of these was post-marked “six
points” all the way down the ﬁeld.

As a whole, the team was plenty
bad on the number and the size of
the penalties dealt out by the referee.
Nine times the referee dealt and
after the deals the Sutherlanders had
lost a total 95 yards. On one oc-
casion, Malarkey trotted something
like 40 yards for a touchdown only
to have the play called back and a
15-yard penalty given the Panthers.

These little things decide many a
ball game when the «opponents are of
more durable stuff and Sutherland
will give the boys a complete diag-
nosis before the West Virginia game
this Saturday at the Stadium. Pass
covering, too, seems to be one of
the points of needed improvements in
the Panthers’ play.

Monday night, the Pitt buoys rested
and went through a chalk ses-sion,
while yesterday was spent in signal
drills on the practice ﬁeld. In the
practice carded for this afternoon
and evening Sutherland will spend a
good part of the time with the m-ov-
ing pictures of Saturday’s game,
pointing o-ut the mistakes for the
beneﬁt -of the Panthers and the detri-
ment of Panther opponents.

The usual minor injuries came out
of the Bishop battle. Several play-
ers, Hensley, Delich, and Souchak
have slight hurts which will mend
during the week. Otherwise, the
squad suffered nothing but bruises.

Tough Five Game

Grid Card Faces
_ Little Panthers
Yearling Squad Prepares

For Opener With Tech
Frosh, October 17

 

Snarling Panther Cubs are being
sent through their paces of charging,
passing and punting by C0ach Mike
Milligan, as they sharpen their claws
for the opening clash with the Tech
Pleb-es three weeks hence.

After opening a tough ﬁve game
schedule with the yearlings from
across the Hollow on October 17 in
Tech territory, the little Panthers
invade Saltsburg to scramble a tough
Kiski eleven. Penn State, scheduled
for Connellsville on October 31, is
the next prey o-r pI‘eYed- The f1'°5h
eleven visits Fairmont, November
11th, to tangle with West Virginia.
Navy at Annapolis on November 21

offers ﬁnal oppositi-on before the year-
lings return to their lair.

Stars Dot Roster

Former scholastic stars dot the
frosh football roster. Fresh from
the Pittsburgh high school gridirons
come Peabody’s fullback, Dickinson,
a former all-scholastic choice, who is
now battling for an end position;
Kornick, wh-o hails from Perry High
and St. Joseph in Baltimore, brings
back memories of Mike Kornick,
Pe-nn State star.

Corace, a former Carrick player,
offers stiff competition, while Holt,
Meadville and Shadyside ﬂash; Stev-
enson, Kiski hope; Kapurka, Oliver
High gridster; Fullerton, Peabody;
and Battaglia, Schenley, round out
the list of local luminaries.

Another Cambal Appears-

Out of towners donning the cleats
for the Panther Cubs include: Cam-
bal of Springdale, the brother of
Clem Cambal, Pitt varsity fullback;
Klein, a promising tackle from Al-
toona; E-tze-, Mount Pleasant boy.
Pennypac-*ker,, East Liverpool, Ohio,
candidate, packs promising perform-
ance. New York State sends to Pitt,
Kish, North Towanda ﬂash; Cassiano,
Albany hope. Stanton Island sends
Go-odell.

Other Pennsy ‘grid proteges are:
Branzo of Ashland, Challingsworth,_
Phoenixville’ phlash; Faltz, Greens-
burg athlete; Peace, Bradford hs.
gridder and Pastin, Stowe Township
high candidate.

Summer Doings

(Continued from Page 1)
Chautauqua ( which is a heckuva word
to spell) were Muriel Murchison and
Lois Follansbee. Ruth Belle Stroth-
ers peacefully summered at Slippery
Rock Creek, while Jughaid Trosen
peacefully slumbered in Nebraska for
several nights.

And, Finally, China

While Evelyn Lowy visited Cleve-
land and Huntington, West Virginia,
Martha Harmeier dipped into Lake
Erie, Mary Campbell capered around
Shamokin, and John Paul Baker pre-
pared to pack for China. Bill Col-
lins, leading “woman” in last year’s
Cap and Gown show, got himself a
job on the S.S. Steel Seafarer and is
on his way around the world. Back
in February.

This about completes the survey.
Sorry if we missed out on some of
you ’uns, but the Long and the Short
of it is that we just don’t know every-
body! But we’ll get around to you
Shortly!

Novice Entrants
Swamp Carlson

With Applications

Tourney For N on-Lettermen
Gains Momentum; Blank
Must Be Filled Out

 

As another ﬂood of applications
ﬁll Dr. Carlson’s clinic oﬁice, the good
doctor continues preparations for his
annual novice cage tourney.

The tournament, which runs Mon-
day, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday,
the week of October 12th, promises
to be the most successful in years
from the standpoint of number of
entries to date. The cage circus is
open to all novice upperclassmen as
well as freshmen, novices, sharks or
mediocre.

All that is necessary to enter is to
ﬁll out the blank designating the time
most suitable and hand it in at the
Stadium or Falk Clinic. Then bor-
row your cousin’s, brother’s or room-
mate’s basketball suit and shoes—or,
for that matter, get anything that
resembles a suit and report at the
Stadium to bask in the sunlight that
is meted out during the tournament.

No Teams Entered

As was so successfully inaugurated

in last year’s epoch tourney, no
teams will be entered. The teams will
be made upon the ﬂoor.
V ‘ It is important that the exact time
and. days are designated on the blank.
The games will begin at 2 o’clock
each day and other teams will play
at intervals of one hour.

It is stressed that there is no en-
trance fee. The games are held en-
tirely for the fun of the sport and to
acquaint the novices with one an-
other.

The most unique uniform will net
its wearer a prize,. while the wearer
of the largest shoes will also get
some award. Big heads and wide
hand-spreads come in handy here for
prizes will be awarded for each of
these- High scorer, outstanding
player and the most accurate foul-
shooter will also receive some sort
of recognition.

The games run from 2 o’clock until
6 o’clock on the designated days.

Mr. W oodruff ’s Out Front, Sir!

THE PITT NEWS

HIS LANKY young gentleman, pictured in the lead of a stirring race,

ran in Mr. Olson's novice track meet last year.

What he did after that

just isn’t news anymore-—but it does go to show that novice track meets

must be plenty okay.

Is that right, Mr. Woodruff?

Mr. Olson?

Olson Summons Candidates
For University Track Meet

Entry Blank To Be Filled Out; Varsity Letter-Winners,
Freshman Numeral Men Barred From Competition;
Stadium Track Open For Practice Daily

P. T. Barnum claimed that a suck-
er was born every minute. Carl
Olson, varsity track coach,’ has a
slightly diiferent idea on the rela-
tive birth rate. He thinks that a
potential track star is born every
minute. And, in his effort to put
those stars in the ﬁrmam-ent, was
born the annual University track and
ﬁeld meet.

This year, which is Olson’s ﬁfth on
the athletic faculty, brings with it
the ﬁfth a1l—University cinder event.
Sometimes it is referred to as a
novice meet.
right. It is a novice meet. All that
is needed for entrance is a desire to
hop around the Stadium in jersey
and shorts, and a signed entry blank.

According to the calendar, the meet
is set for Wednesday afternoon, Oc-
tober 14, at the Stadium. That
means that it’s -only two weeks away.
An entry blank, appearing elsewhere
on this page should be ﬁlled out
pronto and just as pronto shipped up
to the Stadium athletic office or
handed personally to the personable
Mr. Olson.

Only taboos on entries are the
facts that a man must not have
earned either a varsity or freshman
letter in track. Such accomplish-
ments make qualiﬁcation in this meet
impossible. This bears out the state-
ment that this meet is a novice meet
in every sense of the word.

Freshmen are particularly urged

Play-Off Features

Grid Tournament

Enthusiasm Grows As Plans
Approach Final Stage

A play-off between the victors in
the Interfraternity touch football
league and the champion of the Intra-
mural league will climax the “sissy
football” tournament which is to start
as soon as rushing season is over.

With special emphasis being placed
upon intramural sports by the athletic
department this fall and the increased
enthusiasm that has been given touch
football in the last few years, the
game will probably be played by al-
most every man on campus.

As fraternities will need their
pledges to make their teams com-
plete, the interfraternity tournament
will not start until rushing season is
over. Intramural games, however,
will get under way as soon as enough
entries are made to make the round
robin schedule of games complete.

Teams for intramural competition
may be made up by any group of
men. Seniors, freshmen, and even
profs may form teams. Several
elevens will be entered by the School
of Business Administration,‘ the
School of Engineering, the School of
Medicine and the College.

Games will be played on the Schen-
ley Oval and the Trees Field. Most
of the games will be played in the
afternoon, although games may be
scheduled in the morning by special
arrangement with Mr. Martin Feely,
assistant professor of physical edu-
cation and director of intramural
athletics.

And that is just about?

to get in the run of things. High
school reputations, accomplishments,
and medals count for nothing in
this competition. On this point Coach
Olson is emphatic. For rebuttal, he
just trots out his present varsity
track and cross-country teams.

Prominent in their rolls are boys
whose only running in high school
consisted of getting to class on time.
Cross-country, which is the track
foreground these days, features Alex
Leggin, George Co-ok, and Al Zam-
borski. These boys never lifted a
track shoe before they entered Pitt.

Now they form the backbone of
the varsity cross-country team. In
track, Leggin, Cook, and Zamb-orski
are dependable distance runners.
Another prime example ofla track star
who started on the right track at the
University is Eddie Spitz, varsity
dash man.

All of these track men just men-
tioned received their track baptism
in the novice track and ﬁeld meet,
held each fall for just that purpose.
This should serve as something of an
incentive to those interested in the
great Olympic sport.

Practice sessions are easily avail-
able. The Stadium track is open all
day. Equipment will be issued im-
mediately by the track managers.
Sixteen events, running the gamut
of track and ﬁeld events, are listed.
They‘ include foot races, jumping,
and weight events.

tions on campus will attend an im-
portant’ meeting with the S-FA social
committee this‘ afternoon: at 3:45
o’clock in Room 817, Cathedral.

The purpose of the meeting is to
clarify the social rules s_et forth by

the rules is important to prevent
overlapping engagements, last-minute
pustponements, and cancellations
from unapproved petitions.

If the chairman of any organiza-
tion is unable to attend, he is re-
quested to delegate a responsible per-
son as a representative for his group.

A complete roll will be taken. A
copy of the rules will be given each
representative attending and each
organization will be held responsible
for observance of the rules.

The social committee -of SFA, con-
sists of D. C. Schultz, BA38, chair-
man; Charles Wright, BA38, Bettie
Anderson, C37, William McQuade,
E37, N. Robert Seidle, assistant to
the dean of men, Louise Baughman,
C37, and Frank Engel, E38. The
committee will be introduced at the
meeting.

All women social leaders are re-
quested to attend the meeting before
going to the women’s meeting at
Heinz House.

Sophomore Nut Party

“Hearty_Welcome” to Miss Jane
Shurmer and “nuts” to all the Sopho-
more women, are -chief features of
the Soph class nut party to be held

‘ Monday, October 5, at 3:00 o’clock at

After introducing Miss Shurmer ‘as
the class adviser, the. social and pro-
gram committees promise an equally
grand reception to their classmates,
with a round of games, frolics, quips
and merrymaking thatywill turn even
the sanest ' Sophomore‘ “nutty.”

The only guarantee that the host-
esses make "is that each sophomore

New Debate _ Coach’s. Hobby
Proves Town. Salvation
While Waters Rage

During this spring’s disastrous
J ohnstown ﬂood with all other forms
of communication down,=several radio
operators managed to keep the city
in communication with the outside
world. Chief among these was Dr.
Clarke Olney, new assistant profes-
sor of English at the University and
coach of the freshman debaters, who
makes radio work a hobby.

At the time of the ﬂood, Dr. Olney
was a member of the faculty of the
Johnstown Center of the University.
He was also attached to the United
States Naval Communications Re-
serve,_ holding the commission of
lieutenant, junior grade.

When the St. Patrick Day waters
covered the city of Johnstown, Dr.
Olney immediately went on emer-

‘Kick-Off’ Orchestra

Parellels ‘Yankees’

Very closely paralleled are the
music careers of Rudy Vallee and
Bob Fredette. Both were born in
Westbrook, Me., and although
Fredette is younger than Vallee,
they attended Yale University to-
gether. While Vallee led the Foot-
ball Band, Fredette conducted the
Yale Dance Band.

About the time Rudy took his
“Connecticut Yankees” to London
to play, Bob took his orchestra to
Paris. After returning to America
Vallee continued to tour while Bob
Fredette ﬁlled an engagement at
the Ambassador Hotel, New York.
Since that time they have crossed
paths several times.

gency duty at the Communications
Reserve unit there. He worked ﬁrst
for the Red Cross, and later for the
National Guard, sending messages
asking for food, medicine, and other
emergency supplies.

After the primary needs had been
taken care of, he began to handle
personal messages concerning the
welfare -of friends and relatives.

Dr. Olney is still an active mem-
ber in the Communications Reserve.
He drills one evening a week, prac-
ticing sending and receiving mes-
sages, and engaging in regular naval
drills.

In his spare time, he makes stud-
ies of such allied subjects as visual
signaliza-tion, submarine telegraphy,
and the codiﬁcation and de-codiﬁca-
tion of secret naval radio messages.
To gain practical experience, he is
planning to go on a cruise next sum-
mer, possibly visiting Cuba, Key
West, and other ports in the Carrib-
bean vicinity.

The University campus is not
strange to the new debate coach. He
previously spent three years here as
an instructor in English. But that
was nine years ago, and the inter-
vening semesters have been spent as
an assistant professor of English at
the Johnstown Center. ’

Opportunity Knocks
For Would Be Stars

Right on the heels of Regis Too-
mey’s recent visit to the campus" to
see the Panthers play Ohio Wesleyan
comes an outlet from a Hollywood
agent that promises to give other

-, University students the opportunity

that made Toomey a nationally-known
movie star. ,-

Stanley Bergerman, agent of the
movie c.olony»,. has written Carl B.
Cass, director of the Pitt Players,’ to
forward him pictures and data’ on
any likely prospect he might discover
at the University. Mr. Bergerman’s
client has askedhim to make a sur-
vey of college campuses for special
types for use in future productions.

This opportunity is not conﬁned to
members of the Pitt Players but is
open to any University student.
Those interested should contact Mr.

Jewish Students Plan
City-Wide Reception

Jewish students from all the Pitts-
burgh colleges will attenda reception
to be given by the Jewish Student
Council at the YM and WHA on Sat-
urday evening. Myer Rabinowitz,
C39, has been elected president of the
council for this year.

There will be a short business
meeting at 8 o’clock during which ad-
ditional officers will be elected and
plans for the year’s activities formu-
lated. Following the meeting there
will be an informal hour of dancing.

Ruth Rosenthal, C38, has been
elected chairman of the cooperation
committee. Hyman Kimel, C37, will
take charge of Friday Forum lunch-
eons.

Scholastic Requirements Prune
Rolls  Governmental ‘ Course

Students looking for difficult

courses probably will ﬁnd all they can
handle in Government Service Course

of the political science department.

According to Dr. James C. Charles-
worth, assistant professor of political
science and co-ordinator of the un-
dergraduate course, some 59 students
are now enrolled after a pruning in
which 33 hopefuls were dropped.
This, as the result of astringent re-
quirement that a better than 2. aver-
age must be maintained for the four
years.

Of those still in" the course, the
quality point average is 2.16, with
three students having a perfect rec-
ord of all A’s. However, it is pos-
sible, Dr. Charlesworth adds, to be
reinstated in .,the course even. until

the beginning of the junior year if
there is a sufﬁcient improvement in
the student’s scholastic standing.

“What attracts the intellectual, yet
practical, student,” he says, “is the
happy possibility that this training
will enable him to pass almost any
kind of general civil service examina-
tion.” A seminar held in the senior
year “primes” the graduate on what
he will have to face in these _tests.

The course includes training in
public administration, international
trade, public ﬁnance, labor relations,
and the diplomatic service. Accord-
ing to Dr. Charlesworth, “no other
undergraduate school in the country
offers so complete a course.
partment, however, does not guaran-
tee that all its graduates will receive
governmental jobs.”

he received his master's degree at
the University of Pittsburgh, and in
1933, was awarded the degree of
doctor of philosophy. He has also
done graduate work at Columbia
University.

During his stay at J-ohnstown, his
activities were not conﬁned to the
classroom. He coached dramatics at
the Junior College and also directed
for the Little Theater of J ohnstown.
The latter was an activity sponsored
by a Johnstown civic organization.

Dr. Olney, teaching freshman and
sophomore English, is ﬁlling the po-
sition temporarily vacated by Dr.
John W. Dodds, who is now on a
leave of absence. He also teaches
English drama.

Grants Continued
For Social Work

Institute To Be Supported
By Buhl Foundation

This year the department of Social
Work at the University will again
conduct several institutes on social
work.

Made possible by a special grant
from the Buhl Foundation, a series
of about eight two- or three-day in-
stitutes has been planned. The lead-
ers will be national authorities in
their ﬁelds; one of them comes from
Europe. Others are from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, Yale and leading
schools of the country.

Admission to these institutes was
so_greatly in demand last year that
restrictions had to be made, limiting

the number of_ attendants from each

agenc‘y.ﬂ , _ .

The complete program and plans
of this year’s Institute will be an-
nounced later. '
