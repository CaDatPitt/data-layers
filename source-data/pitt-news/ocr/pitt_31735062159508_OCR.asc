Temporary Center  
Needs University,
hurh Agreement 

By JACK MARKOWITZ
A student center in Grace Evangelical Reformed Church needs
only a University-church agreementto become a reality, according
to Dick Campbell, chairman of the SCF Council spmsoring the

Center plan.
Yesterday afternoon the dean

\

were to confer on the proposed Center, though Mr. Biddle has ex-
pressed his doubts that any University decision would be forth-

coming in the very near future.

The idea of the temporary student center was presented to the
Student Christian Federationby R

Church. The church believes that
’ such a gesture would put its large-
ly unused facilities to a definite
service. Since .heat and light are
being used anyway, it is not felt
that studentuse of the church rooms
,will increase expenses to any ex-
tent.
Following receipt of the church
offer, the executive council of the

needed; any Pitt junior is invited»,
to attend.

On Jan. 18, Senior Court held its
first reception. This affair was for
a smaller group‘ and entailed sign-
ing up a reservation in advance.

Chancellor Fitzgerald will meet
junior class open housers at 3:30
p.m. in his office on the first floor
of the Cathedral.According to Miss
Egge, the Chancellor has been
enthusiastically behind all senior
court plans to further personal con-
tact between him and Pitt students.

Miss Egge views the open house
as an opportunity not onlyfor better
acquaintance with the Chancellor,
but also as a chance to catch a
glimpse of his ideas and plans for
the University.

Light refreshments will be ser-
ved during the open house, pro-
bably in the nature of tea and
cookies-

Senior Court has also arranged
for two. more receptions during the
coming semester. Exact dates have
not been set at this time.

MC Plans for Lounge
Blocked Temporarily

Plans for the proposed 8th floor men’s lounge have temporarily bogged
down, Men's Council learned last Tuesday.
Roy Nelson, chairman of Council's lounge committee, reported that

Pool Opened
At Trees Gym

Gym students will be in the swim
.next week for the first time since
before the Christmas recess. At
that time, a stream of liquid cement
forced through the basement wall
ofthe building,and as a safety mea-
sure classes were suspended

survey of the damage showed
that cracks had developed in the
pool as a result of the weakening
of the structure. The tank has re-
mained out of use even after the
reopening of the gym following the
holidays.

the future of the lounge idea de-
pends largely on Dr. John Weber,
secretary of the University, who is
now in Florida.

Dr. Weber must okay the trans-
ferring ofmusic appreciation classes
out of the pro-posed location, room
817, before Men's Council can enter.
According to Nelson, however, D-ean_
Biddle has given his assurance
that “stronger measures” will be
undertaken to secure 817 as a lounge.

Must Share Lounge

The Council lounge plans as out-
lined by Nelson call for comfortable
furniture, music, cigarette and candy
machines, and a magazine and book
rack to supply the proper atmos-
phere. Several hours of the week,

Legislator’s Proposal Turns SC
Meeting Into Verbal Free-For-All

Don Ewart turned last Monday’s Student Congress meeting from an
informal discussion to a verbal battle when he advocated that Congress
consider "fostering”,an independent organization.

He visualized the organization
primarily as a federation of small
groups, which might eventually

” branch into politics, V
Failed in Past

“Past independent movements
have failed,” Ewart said, "because
of poor leadership and because they
have been political in purpose.”

Betty Bolger wanted to know if
Ewart was sajking that this organi-
zation-to-be-formed should have
"limited political power.”

"No,” emphatically replied Ew-
art. "He later added that experience
would indicate that ‘a "proper bal-

, ance between the amounts of
"V energy” spent by the group on acti-
C ities s

tion, Pitt is just a “mass of cold
stone,” remarked Maher.
“The independents,” Maher said

Plan Defined

"Fostering,” was defined by Ray
Maher as choosing a committee to
select possible leaders and allow-
ing limited financial aid by Cong-
ress to the new group.

Mrs. Patricia Shields, faculty
advisor to Congress, pointed out
that with Spring elections on the
way this proposal might look "sus-
picious.” '

Both Maher and Ewart are frat
members and Maher is‘ president of
IF Council.

Phyllis Beck felt that such an
organization would segregate the
students even more than they are
now.” Activities should be promoted
for all students, ‘Dick Campbell
said. i _ _ H , 

"need an attachmen-t to a small
group. Now when we want people
at a rally we call the frat houses.”

Flora Diemert, Congress presi-
dent, reminded Congress that their
constitution prohibits the recogni-
tion of any political group, and thus

Congress could not recognize a
group which “might eventually
branch into politics."

A socially-minded independent

group would no more tend to enter
politics than would any of the
groups on campus,countered Maher.

Called “Untrue"
Campbell called Maher and Ewart
“untrue to their own groups (frat-
,ernities.)”
.\‘'We sit in Congress not' as frat

the band and glee club will be fel-
'low tenants of 817, regardless of
the elaborateness of the lounge
furnishings.

Another developement of Coun-
cil's meeting Tuesday was the re-
signation of the only independent
member, Bill Blockstein. Blockstein,
a senior in the Pharmacy School
School and the representative of
that school, resigned because of a
"pressing academic schedule.” He
will, however, continue to serve on
certain committees.

Other Positions Vacated

Along with Blockstein’s, several
positions on Council have been
vacated due to graduations and dis-
missals. To fill these jobs, one
Bus Ad senior, two Engineering
seniors, and a Pharmacy senior or
junior willbe electednext Tuesday.
Council will also‘ select a Vice-
President since that position is al-
so vacant.

Certain members of council are
not allowing the "double-duty”

turmoil to die without a fight. Two
amendments which would have re-
stricted the holding of two legis-
lative jobs have been narrowl

Talks Here

Dr. David Bradley, author of "N01
Place to Hide", an account.of‘the
atomic bomb experiments at Bikin .,
will speak at Stephen Foster Mem-
orial on Feb. 22 at 2:30 p.m. under;
the auspices of Student Congress.

Dr. Bradley; was an eyewitness
observer and radiological techni-
cian at Bikini atoll in 1946. He wa
one of a score of technicians who
were specially trained to determine‘
after the bomb had exploded, the
amount of radio activity in the tar-
gets. '

During the five and a half months .
that he remained at Bikini, Dr. Brad-
ley took advantage of the unusual
opportunities to study the effects
of atomic radiation on marine, plant
and animal life. ,

Norman Cousins of the Saturday
Review of Literature has summa-
rized Dr. Bradley's main thesis;
“The principal danger of atomic
warfare is represented.. . . .by the‘
strong and unmanageable forcehf
radioactivity. " Bradley states flatly
that there is no defense against
atomic attack. . _ C 
, The title of Dr. Bradley's speech
Wednesday willbe the same.

posed that Student Congress "fos
This reporter, as does Congre

Don Ewart at last Monday's Student Congress meeting dropped
a bombshell that might explode as high as last Fall’s fracas on
the rally dispute. I-Ie, supported by IF President Ray Maher, pro-

ter” an independent group.
ss, recognizes the dire need for-

an independent group on campus.
Four-fifths ofthe students are not
attached to any group, be it social,
honorary, or otherwise.

Wrong Backer

Maher and Ewart’s plan calling
for a number of small social groups
linked together in a central coun-
cil is a practical one. and the only
way that an independent organiza-
tion could be effective.

But the success of their plan is
doubtful.

Its success will be hindered if
Maher and Ewart are adamant in
their stand that Congress sponsor
the organization.

Congress has as much power to
"foster” an independent organiza-
tion as it does to support Inter-
fraternity Council. Both Maher and
Ewart admit that their offspring
would eventually become the poli-
tical voice of the independents at
Pitt.

As such, it would challenge IF’s ,
position as the dominant political
voice on campus. Because the
frats hold such a minority of the
male population at Pitt, an effec-
tive independent organization could
completely subjugate the frats in
Pitt’s political arena.

Secondly, an organization spon-
sored by Student Congress is

actually sponsored by IF Council
and the independents should never
have to look to another organiza-

tion for its parenthood, particu-
larly if that parent is probably
the only organization that will

offer the independents any oppo-
sition. ‘

IF holds the majority vote in
Congress. While some frat mem-_.
bers at last Monday's meeting dis-
agreed, they will have to reach an
agreement before the proposal can
be passed.

Frat Tie-in Unhealthy

In other words, if the indepen-
dent organization is to be,Con-
gress sponsored, the frats are go-
ing to have to like it.

Thus the independents would be
morally obligated to the frats. This
would obviously be an unhealthy
situation as -the frat members and
non-frat members would certainly

clash, not on purposes, but on
methods. ~
Possibly Maher and Ewart’s

proposal will give some aspiring
independent leaders a push in the
right direction. Such a push is
‘certainly necessary but it can al-
so 'push too far, and wind up just
where it began without accomplish-
ing anything.

“Letters Abroad.” Its slogan might
postage.”

Nineteen thousand men and wo-
men from all over the world are
exchanging letters and learning
about each other’s countries in
correspondences arranged by Uni-
ted Nations-sponsored Letters
Abroad. The World Affairs Coun-
cil, a citizen’s group in Philadel-
phia, started the Letters Abroad
program last May as their answer
to the question, “What can we as

individuals do to strengthen the
uneasy peace?”
Twenty-one thousand other

letters asking for American corres-
pondents are on file. Anyone, and
that includes Pitt students, can
buy a friend for a 3-cent stamp.

Here are a few bits taken from
_the letters received:

"I await your letter with a
craned neck,” says a Japanese.
doctor, hoping eagerly to exchange
ideas and points of view with a
doctor in America.

Befatrirce Strakosch, a 17-year-
old Czechoslovakian refugee now
living in Austria, wants someone
to send her some newspapers and
magazines. She writes to Letters
Abroad, "Please find for me an
American student that is willing
to write with me and send me also
his magazines.

"I cannot pay him because I

am verv poor. But I know that
there are very good people in

A farmer's market of international culture and a clearing house for
friendships between the little. people of the world --- that describes

well be "Big values for a few cents

America because they help us to
live and so I hope with all my
heart that you find anybody who
is willing to write with me.” '

].B. Bossers, a 20-year-old
technical school student in Ams-
t-e_;da'm, whose English isvery good,
writes, “Whether  (my corres-
pondent)  is a boy or a girl, _
never mind! Of course with boys
there are more possibilities to
write about machinery, but ex-
perience says that girls are truer.”

Keiji Yamada is a Tokyo stu-
dent interested in reading and
photography. He would like to
correspond with a person of the
"gentle sex."

In quaint, polite English, he
writes, "When I am about to pen,
I am fill with delight. I am very
glad to send my first letter to a
frined I have never seen.”

Thousands of friendships by
mail already formed are helping
the peoples of the 'wprld to under-
stand each other on a man-to-man
level, not a striped pants, top hat
diplomatic level. ,

Pitt students, I hope, will not
be as apathetic about the Letters
Abroad program as aDuquesne man
I talked to during the holidays.
When shown Beatrice’s picture,
he remarked,‘ "Pretty nice, but
Austria is a long walk home at
Lone o’clock in the morning.”

Letters to the

Editor

Our student opinion poll doesn’t
reach everyone .nor does it cover
every topic. That’s the purpose of
letters to the editor. The News.
welcomes all correspondence. How-
ever, letters should be brief. Ad-
dress them to: Editor, Pitt News,
825 Cl. They must be signed and,
of course, the News reserves the
right to withhold publication of any
letters not in good taste.

Editor,
Pitt News

As a rule people will not go to
the trouble of writing letters edit-
orially unless they feel very
strongly about the subject, so you
can imagine how I feel about the
matter discussed below.

As a graduating senior I now
feel free to voice my complaints
against certain faculty members
here at Pitt without worrying what
will happen to my grades. Much as
it may be denied by. those con-
cerned, there are teachers (a small

prejudicial and incompetent. In
each class, their favored few can
exceed their number of cuts, miss
exams, etc., and still come out of
the course with an A. If others
are having trouble learning the
subject matter, they and they alone
are to blame the teacher as-
sumes no responsibility.

I If any attempt is made -to decry
such high-handedness the histron-A
ics begin. They assume an air of
rightous indignation and so much
as say, “Who do you think you
are? -- I can do no wrong.” Suffice
it to say that any further argument
will rgsult in reprisals and it re-
quires no imagination to figure
out what form they will take.

Well, everybody isn’t stupid
enough to be fooled and over-awed
by such juvenile tactics. Such con-
duct does the teacher irreparable
harm and loses them the friend-
ship and good will of many stu-
dents. All the students ask for:
is fair play and really that isn't
too much to ask. ‘

  

  
  
 
    

-Dual Office Holding Faces Revision

Point Scale
System May

Be Answer

By LOIS FOIGHT

Recent student and editorial
discussions of the men's dual
office holding problem are para-
lleling plans being formed by the
dean of men's office to find a
solution to it.

According to Theodore W. Biddle,
dean of men,’ “Some form of point
scale is to be installed as soon as
free personnel are found.”

Before World War II all students
were under a student activities
point scale system which covered
all extra curricular work.

Since the war, however, women
only have ‘been under a limiting
system. Plans for the men's scale
will make it similar to the women’s
present one.

“We’ve been moving toward it for
the last year,” Mr. Biddle com-
mented last week, adding that he
and his staff "believe in the policy
of spreading our offices in student
activities.” A

The new point scale system would
be organized with the purpose of
limiting important posts to only
those elegible, and limiting the
activities these students may take
part in. Mr. Biddle feels that extra-
curricular activities at Pitt are
privileges to be enjoyed by the
student only as long as academic

interests and health are safe-
guarded.
Requirements for participation

in activities will be; a minimum of
12 credit hours, scholastic ele-
gibility, concurrence with univer-
sity standards of conduct, attend-
ance and scholarship, and approval
by the Point Scale Committee.

Among present student leaders
whose activity schedules probably
would be affected by the installa-
tion of the point scale system are:

Howard Greenberger, president
of Men's Council, vice president of
the YMCA, president of Phi Epsi-
lon Pi, and member of student Con-
gress.

Don Wilde, president of the YMCA
and treasurer of Student Congress.

Bill Swanson‘, president of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, member of the
debate squad, and vice president
of Student Congress.

would arrange for a transfer of one

large room to SCF supervision as a

student lounge and office. The

other rooms, including offices,

meeting places, a gamelroom, and a

dir1ing room, would be available at
the discretion of Rev. Stamm, who
would give them to the center when-
ever possible’.

Supervision of the center would
probably be the job of the student
pastors. The facilities would be
«open from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the
afternoon, and in the evening for
special groups. All students would
be welcome at the church, located
a few blocks from the Cathedral.

This tentative arrangement was
accepted by the ACF Council last
Tuesday, and the plans were to be

‘considered by the University yes-
terday afternoon.

Swimmers

Aim To Get
Penn State

By STAN SKIRBOLL

Pitt's only undefeated sports
team -- the swimming team -- will
‘attempt to keep its record intact
tomorrow evening at 8 o’clock at

the YMHA pool, when they meet,

the club that spoiled their perfect
record last year -- Penn State.

The Panther tankers are out not
only to avenge their only loss, but
also to prove that"we wuz robbed.”

Veteran Pitt swimmers to this
day contend that poor officiating
robbed them of victory in two ev-
ents. “They wanted to win in the
worst way, and they made sure'they
did,” as one swimmer put it.

Wilde Event Disputed

The loudest squawk came in the
50-yard free style event, when the
entire‘ Pitt team thought Don Wilde
touched first in a tight three-way
finish. But the judges awarded the
first two places to State and gave
Wilde a third.

Although Coach Ben Grady would
not admit that his team was prim-
ing a little more than usual for the
he had his swimmers
puffing from the Workouts that he
gave them last week.

Boys HUD”

Grady did say, however, that his
boys were "up” for the meet. "We
wantvtoiwin this one,” he said,
"and‘ I'll take a one-point victory,
too.” .

WCAE, with Ray Scott announc-
ing, will make a tape recording of
the meet for rebroadcast later in
the evening.

MANAGERS WANTED
Applicants for track managers
can report to Head Manager Henry
Sundermann at Gate 3 of the Sta-

dium at 3:30 any day next week.

F rash Hoopster Virostek

Specializes in Rebounds

The tallest of the tall Freshman
basketballers, 6-5 Donnie Virostek
is in the basketball background at
the moment, but in the near future
he’s going to blossom out as one
of Doc Carlson's better basketball
players. The quiet, easy-going boy
will be heard from not by his marks-
manship but by his ability at re-
bound work. ‘

Under the bucket - either one - the
18-year-old athlete is as valuable
a man as Coach Bobby Artman has
on his frosh squad. The big boy
has no trouble finding the ballafter
it ricochets from the boards, but he
is not too accurate on his shots.

This difficulty is slowly being

Herb Douglas Out To Break
Broad Jump ‘Jinx Year’

Pitt’s Olympic star Herb Douglas will be out to break a jinx tomorrow
when he defends his national AAU broad jumping title at the AAU_ games
in New York’s Madison Sqriare Gardens.

/Since 1945, when the Panther ace, currently a graduate student, first
won the AAU crown, he has had the misfortune of lbsing it every other
year. He lost the title in l946,,recaptured it in 1947, but lost it again
in 1948. Last year he once more regained his crown.

This ‘time Douglas hopes to break
the jinx. Two men, however, will
have something to say on the mat-
ter. They are the ex-Panther’s chief
-competitors for the crown, Fred

It can't be said that Athletic

Student expression and a News
editorial favored the appointment
of Dick Cassiano to the head
coaching job. He did not get it,

Trustees met yesterday and put the
official stamp on the acceptance
of Mike Milligan’s resignation and
the appointment of Casanova to a
four-year term.

The new coach's salary, esti-
mated by the newspapers at $15,000,

the former figure been true, Casa-

, Athletic Director Tom Hamilton must have run his finger
i_ through his collar when the introduction of Mike Milligan was

greeted with a thunderous ovation
at the Dapper Dan banquet earlier
this week. Hamilton,‘of course, was
present as the cheers shook the
woodwork.

Some say the applause was in-
stigated by "a_ large faction from
Aliquippa, Pa., Milligan’s home
town. It's doubtful that Mike would

2 welcome that kind of a favor.

And speaking of Hamilton’s
current discomforts, Jimmy Hagan,
ex of the athletic director's chair,
must be reflecting that it is good to

' beiin industrial personnel-work.

More and more does it become
apparent that collegiate athletic
departments ought to get together
with political science and soci-

' ology departments. The latter two

teach us that unfavorable laws
should be repealed or revised, not
flaunted. Yet the athletic depart-
ments find such procedure unnec-
essary.

Naturally the main tent example
is the NCAA Sanity Code, which

i * the sports boys set up and ignore

in the same breath. But how about
basketball’s two minute rule?

Granted it's a bum statute, but
that hardly excuses the many
schools (particularly in New York
City) for pretending it just does

. not exist.
, And for a first hand example of

rule flaunting, we

Why the officials do not even
send him to a teensy weensy luke
warm shower is the $64 question.

Rex Peery, Panther wrestling
coach, seems destined never to
make his name famous. City papers
keep calling him Perry.

Peery’s team, winless, by the
way, in eight matches, should im-
prove next year. There is material
on the way. One of the future Pitt
wrestlers will be Peery’s son who
is currently a busy high school
champion down in Oklahoma.

Wiry Rex has had only one suc-
cessful grappler this year, he being
165-pounder jim Conklin. They say
Frank Skirpan would have been
strong in the 145-pound class had
he not been forced to spend his
nights tending bar.

Bob Kaufman, head basketball
manager, tells this one. “At half-
time the score is Penn State 5, us
zero. So the ref comes up to the
scoring table and says, ‘Do the
books check?’ ”

Doc’s Boys
Do Battle
With Titans

With the wolves at his door,
Dr. H.’C. Carlson again takes his
basketball squad on the road to-
morrow, to play the Westminister
Titans at Farrell. _.

The Panther coach has changed
his slogan from "Win ’em all” to
"Win one more.” A

That one nfore victory, however,
does not figure to occur tomorrow.
The Titans have already dumped
the Panthers at the Stadium and
should win handily on the neutral
Farrell floor.

Frosh Seek Revenge

Bobby Artman’s freshman team
seeks revenge for a 48-46 loss to
Westminister jayvees in the pre-
liminary to the main affair.

Despite four straight losses on
the road, Pitt will stick with the
same starting combination against
Westminster.‘ The Titans have a
16-2 record as compared with the
Panthers’ 3-ll mark.

High scoring George McCrossin
continues to be the big man in the
Panther attack, having tallied
194 points in 14 games,’ for an
average of 14 points per game.

Duquesne’s Pesty Hromanik has
scored 85 points followed by Guard
Bob Yurko with 81 markers. '

Close to David

McCrossin is close to last year’s
star, Sammy David's average of
15.6 points per game.

Pitt has three games to play
following tomorroW’s Westminster
game. They face Carnegie Tech
away and have a home and home
series with West Virginia.

SGT. WATTS SHABLOWSKI
Another Good Season

By DAVID GROTJOHAN

The word forfeit seems to be
taking the place of scores in intra-
mural games recently.

The Dental Freshmen were to
play the Pharmacy Mixers in what

was to be a decisive gamein the

Professional league Tuesday night.
Neither team showed up. The Dent
Frosh were tied for the lead while
the Mixers were one half game out.

Now there could be a number of
excuses for this game not being
played. There is a possibility that
the Mixers did not hear about the
gamer: in time, but the Dents had a
schedule. There is also the possi-
bility that some mutual agreement
was made.

At any rate two officials, whose
time does have some importance,
satiand twiddled their thumbs for
an hour.

If it is true that the Mixers did
not hear about the game the Dents
will suffer the loss. If both teams
were informed they will each suffer
the forfeit.

Y Upset

.Battling against a hardened
YMCA team throughout the season
without any success, the National
League entries were unable to un-
hinge the Wiseme.n from their sad-
"dle until the second place Beaver
Valley Pittites chased the leaders
with an impressive 42-27 victory,
Wednesday.

There were weakened by the ab-

sence of Dave Dietterich, who was
summoned by the Pitt frosh last
week. Nevertheless, the Y kept
pace through the first three quar-
ters until Bob Wogan and Dick Kost
of the BVP’s combined two point
ers to leave the final count with

15 points separating the teams.

Pi Lams Win

Two charity shots in the final
quarter proved the margin of vic-
tory for the Pi Lams Monday night,
as the highly rated PiKA’s were
upset for their second defeat of
the season 28-26.

The statistics were as close as
the final score with both teams
tallying 11 field goals and both
teams committing 14 personal fouls.
But the Pi Lams registered two
more _free throws than their op-
ponents to give them the edge in
the game.

With tall Fred Klien and Howie
Perlman taking rebounds, the Pi
Lams drove back from a one point,
17-16, deficit to outscore the Yel-
low shirts, 12 points to 9, in the

Rifle CbachLikesHome  
Cooking Plus Good Shot .

There's nothing like home cooking. That's the opinion of Sergeant
Watts Shablowski, Pitt varsity rifle coach, who has eaten plenty ofarmy
chow during his nine years of service.

After spending 15 months overseas, including three months in nine

different African hospitals and five
months at Valley Forge hospital,
Shablowski was assigned to duty
here as supply sergeant and rifle
coach. And the Sarge thinks it's a
nice assignment since Pittsburgh
is his ‘home town._

Now in his fourth year at Pitt,
the 27-year-old sergeant has another
good rifle team this year, much to
his delight. Last year the riflers
were undefeated and with three top
men back the black bullseyes shoiild
take a sound beating.

Coordination Important

"There’s a. lot of things that go
into making a good shot,i’ says
Shablowski, "but coordination, is
the most important of all. You have
to hold the rifle still and squeeze
the triggerat the same time.”

The stockily built army vet should
know what it takes to be a good
rifler. He was a crack shot while
in high school and he had plenty of

chances to takeabead on the enemy g

while in Africa and Sicily.

During the African campaign,
Shablowski was with the First In-
fantry Diwision. He fought in the
Kasserine Pass and received the
Star for Qutstanding rear
guard action. He also holds the
Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Com-
bat Infantry Badge.

Wounded in Sicily ,

After Africa, the Sarge took a
slow boat to Sicily wher.e..he was
wounded in the leg by a machine
gun bullet.

Now married to an Oakland girl
and the father of a two-year-old
daughter, Shablowski hates to think
of being transferred. He thinks
there's no duty like Pitt duty.

Dr. Hovey
Recvering

In Hospital

Dr. Walter R. Hovey, head of the
fine arts department, is in West
Penn Hospital with a double frac-
ture in his right leg set and heal-
ing. The leg was broken when he
was hit by an automobile last
Sunday night.

Not one to take a broken leg
completely lying down, however,
Dr. Hovey looked up from his hos-
pital bed to tell a News reporter,
“I’ll bet my students are happy
that I am put away for a while."

He says that he is healthy aside
from a steady pain in the injured
leg but forsees a bit; of trouble
when it finally heals far enough
to be useable because of the many
steps in the Cathedral. '

As Dr. Hovey says, "My classes
are on the third floor and my of-
fice is on the seventh. Since the
elevator does not stop on these
floors I will have to walk 29 steps
every day.”

The car which struck .him was
driven by Harold Steinberg, 28,

was taken to the hospital in the
same vehicle. Hit while crossing
