Rally
protests g
Salvador
funding  

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer

Strong winds threatened to
blow over signs and banners but

not the spirit of over 100 people »

who marched Saturday against
U.S. aid to El Salvador.

Participants charged that the
United States is giving military
and monetary aid to a right—wing
faction in El Salvador which uses
death squads and purge trials to
keep the political environment in
check. 7

O This faction may be placed in

at

charge of the government if it
wins the upcoming election.

”These are elections of war,”
said America Sosa, an El Salvado-
ran who has been a target of at-
tack by her government.

’’I was persecuted for my work
in human rights and with the
Catholic Church,” she said.

Sosa is currently a representa-

tive of Committee of Mothers of

the Disappeared and Persecuted
of El Salvador (Comadres), an or-
ganization committed to promot-
ing human rights in El Salvador.

Sosa has been in the United
States for four years.

She said thatshe is marching to
find a solution to the problems in
her country and to urge this coun-
try to aid in finding that solution.

Before the march from Car-
negie Mellon University's Soft-
ware Engineering Institute to; the
Cathedralof Learning, then to
Soldiers and Sailrs Memorial,
speaker Rick Adams, who is run-

- ning for a spot on the Pittsburgh

city council, said, ”The United
States is financing a war in El Sal-
vador, and that must be
stopped.”

He added,‘ ”We are trying to
build a new political consensus

\____in this country.”

The marchers are also opposed
to U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan

. Contras, and "as they marched

down Forbes Avenue they shout-
ed slogans such as, ”Down with
the Contras; up with the people!”

They raised the volume when
they noticed three U.S. Navy
officers across the street.

When the marchers reached
the front steps’ of the Cathedral,
they fell quiet to listen to Pitt ac-
tivist Mary Tidlow speak of an El

. Salvadoran man who was impri- .

soned and tortured for political
reasons.

For The Pitt News

After watching her husband die

from brutal torture in an El Sal-
vadoran prison, America Sosa,f
drawing from her personal _ ex— 7

perience, delivers .a strong plea to
end the war in El Salvador.
‘Sosa is a representative of the
group Comadres, a committee- of
mothers and relatives of political

prisoners and missing and'assas-‘

sinated people of El Salvador.
Now living as a political refu-
gee in Washington, D.C., Sosa
speaks throughout North Ameri-
ca about the violation of human
rights in El Salvador. Wednesday
night she spoke at the University
of Pittsburgh School ‘of Law,
where she related her shocking

. expenence.

”My son was a 14-year-old stu-
dent,” Sosa began. ”He was cap-
tured by the police, who claimed
he was a rebel. My son was then
taken to a prison where he was
tortured both mentally and phys-
ically  this is the way the Sal-
vadoran police operate; they
torture someone until he admits

tothe charges against him."

Sosa said that her son was de-

l tained in prison for seven months
' without being formally charged
‘ or ‘having the opportunity to de-

fend himself in any way.
“The only basisforhis deten-

tion was a document that he was.

was a prisoner in the basement of
the police station.

When she went to the police
station with her husband's
brothers, Sosa was told that no
prisoners were kept there.

”My husband's brothers told

‘forced to sign under torture. The

only witnesses to the document
were the officers who were ad-
ministering the torture,” Sosa
said.

After the eventual release of her
son, Sosa said, her husband was
captured by the police.

”My husband was a victim of
suspicions,” Sosa said. ”He was

.a government worker and had

never been politically involved.”

Eight days _after the disappear-
ance of her husband, said Sosa,
she received a message on her

doorstep saying that her husband '

a prisoner at the station and they.

would not leave until they saw
him,” Sosa said.

After a while, officers appeared
carrying her husband, who was
unable to walk because of the
brutal torture he had endured.
The police told Sosa there had
been a ”mistake.”

bandto the hospial but was told -

Sosa took her husband home,

Salvadorans cast votes amid combat

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador
(AP) — Salvadorans voted for a
new president Sunday as leftist
revolutionaries opposed to the
election attacked military posts
and army troops countered with
rockets and rifle fire.

At least five guerrillas and two
soldiers were killed in fighting in
nine provincial towns, according
to military officials and witness-
es. Two journalists and a Dutch
television cameraman also were
reported killed.

Early voter turnout appeared
diminished by the combat and a
rebel-imposed transport ban. But
Roman Catholic churches were
crowded with Palm Sunday wor-
shipers, at least some of whom
planned to vote later. By midday,
there were long lines at the
downtown polling stations.

Turnout was light in smaller
towns.

”With these problems, it's bet-
ter to stay home,” said Jose
Carlos Ortiz, 23. He spoke in
front of his home in the capital as
guerrillas retreated from an as-
sault on a military post three
blocks away.

' March 21“!

Sporadic rifle fire echoed from
the slope of the Guazapa volcano
north of the capital, a guerrilla
stronghold, as troops from the ar-
my’s elite Bracamonte battalion
pursued the insurgents. Two air
force helicopters raced toward
the volcano and fired rockets into
the mountainside.

Guerrillas of the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front
are waging a 9-year-old war
against the U.S-backed
government.

Salvadorans voted to elect a
president from among seven can-
didates. Fidel Chavez Mena of
the incumbent Christian
Democratic Party and Alfredo
Cristiani of the rightist Nationalist
Republican Alliance, or Arena,
led the field in polls. But neither
was likely to receive the more
than 50 percent required to avoid
agrunoff next month.

PS U room and board

NEWS BRIEFS

State University's annual room
and board will increase by 5.3
percent, or $160, for the coming
school year and officials caution
there may be an even larger tui-
tion increase than the one
planned.

The university’s Board of
Trustees approved the room and
board increase for the 1989-1990
school year during their meeting
Saturday.

”The university is anticipating
increased operating costs for
food, labor, benefits, utilities,
maintenance and other expenses
involved in providing room and
board to more than 16,000 stu-
dents,” said Steve Garban, senior
vice president for finance and
operations.

A student in a standard double
room with a mid—priced meal
plan will pay $3,190 for the
1989-90 school year. More than
80 percent of the undergraduate
on-campus population at Penn
State is housed in the standard
double room.

Mother files charges
against principal

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Crimi-
nal charges have been filed
against the principal of the Moun-
tain View Christian School in
Dauphin County after the mother
of a 7-year-old student claimed
the principal beat her son, ac-
cording to published reports.

According to the reports, Susan
Rothenberger said her son came
home from school on Dec. 2 with

bruises extending from the small

 

of his back to the backs of his
knees.

”He was black and blue,” she
said in a story in Sunday's edi-
tions of The Philadelphia Inquir-
er. ”He was screaming. l put-him
in a Christian school to be loved,
to be taught with love, not to be
beaten," she said. .

The legal case against th
school's principal, David
Douglass, came to light in a re-
cent issue of the Hershey Chroni-
cle, a weekly newspaper, afterga
preliminary hearing.

  Why we don't need

AK—47s in every-pot

The nation's ”drug czar,” William Bennett, presiden-
tial appointee to lead the war on drugs, has reportedly
received vague threats from the National Rifle Associ-
ation concerning his political career. The NRA is com-
monly known as the most belligerent of political
lobbying organizations, renowned for swamping legis-
lators with letters and postcards.

The NRA has denied that it ever implied that if Ben-
nett ”has any thoughts of «a political future, he can for-
get them if he doesn't respect the power of the NRA.”
NRA Executive Director Wayne LaPierre described the

allegations as ”absolutely ridiculous.” Another source ‘

from the group said, ”That’s not how we operate,” and

suggested that an individual might have called and‘

claimed to be representing the NRA. Bennett's reaction
to the threats was described by administration sources
as ”livid.” ’

What could be provoking such heated exchanges? A
simple issue, mainly the suspension of the import of
the gun known as the AK-47 assault rifle.’

The AK-47 is a semiautomatic weapon.

There is a difference between a rifle and a weapon:
Rifles are for target practice and hunting; weapons are
for killing people. . '

An AK-47 is about as necessary for a ”sportsman” as
a fragmentation grenade. There is no conceivable rea-
son for the use of this gun for anything except killing.
There is a vast number of guns suitable for target shoot-
ing, so why does a sportsman need an assault rifle?

At the very, very least, a waiting period is appropri-
ate for the purchase of this sort of gun. Six months is
a reasonable amount of time foran FBI security check
on an individual purchasing an AK-47. Unless, of
course, the gun buyer really, really needs it for tomor-
row. Anyone who really, really needs an AK-47 for
tomorrow is someone who should not, under any cir-
cumstances, be allowed to have one. ._

-As far as hunting is concerned, the gun is not neces-
sary. Anyone who requires 2O to 40 shots without
reloading, to kill a stag, is, again, someone who should
not be allowed to have one. , _

What we come down to, in terms ofpeople who want
this gun, is this: a small group of target shooters who
feel they can't do without it; a small group of bad shots
who would_like to hunt with it; and a very large group

of drug.dea|ers, other criminals and sociopaths who find .

it a much more convenient device for killing people

than other forms of semiautomatic weaponry. .
Perhaps restrictions on the import and sale of this

weapon are not for the express purpose of infuriating

gun buffs, but merely a way for some of us to sleep a

little more soundly at night.

Learning orgetting adiploma?

As the semester nears its end,
the time has come to register for
classes. The long linesquickly
form at Thackeray as students im-
patiently wait for their desired
courseslto be entered into the
computer.

AMY KING
LIEBMAN  

With luck, you were able to get
an early appointment ‘with your
adviser, reducing the possibility
of closed classes, and you arrived
at the registrar’s office at a
reasonable hour, limiting the time
you spent waiting.

Strategically planned or not,
registration, in general, is one big
hassle.

Yet, have you ever taken the
time to question why you take
part in this dreadful activity?

Is it to fulfill necessary require-
ments in order to get a job that
would be impossible to attain
with simply a high school
diploma? ‘

What has happened to the idea
of taking classes — attending col-
lege — to receive an education?-

Students seem to glance briefly

through the course description
guides looking for the easiest
class, ‘perhaps one that only en-
tails two exams, absolutely no
papers, and is offered at a time of
day that conveniently fits their
schedules.

Students can easily take the
safest way to get adegree from
Pitt by simply going through the
motions — taking the least‘
demanding courses necessary for
graduation.

Take, for example, the College
of Arts and Science general edu-_
cation requirements. Insteadrof
taking mandatory core classes,
CAS has designed. a system in
which it is possible to tailor re-
quirements to meet individual in-
terests. 1

Within a four—year period at
Pitt, this system allows students
to choose from approximately
800 courses to meet these re-
quirements, yet undergraduates
tend to take the same old classes.

For example, with nearly 50
courses from 10 different depart-
ments approved for the social
science requirement, every
semester about 40‘percent of the
students enroll in Econ 10 or 11,
and another large proportion of
students take Anthro 80 to satis-

fy this requirement.

‘But this convenient approach
evokes a large number of com-
plaints as students apathetically
attend these enormous lectures.
To the professor, you are just a
face or even a number in a class
with about 200 other students.

Yet courses like ”Comparative
Economic Systems” (Econ 52) or
”Urban Anthropology” (Anthro
155), for instance, also fulfill the
social science requirement, but
enrollment tends to be less than
50 students pegr,a:_c>:;_l.,asgs,...;g.  

Perhaps cours?e?s"'like these are
risky, as they might demand a
few extra hours of studying, a
paper, or even class participation.

The ”easy motions” that so

many students take can be altered.

so that the student receives more
than just a diploma —- an educa-
t_ion that goes hand-in-hand with

small, private colleges is availa-.

ble at Pitt.

Quality education at Pitt is not
handed outon a silver platter. In
the end,» it isup to the individual

student to decide what kind of-

academic experience he or she
would like to achieve. ‘

Amy King Liebman is a colum-
nist for The Pitt News.

Perpetuati n g hatred. for women

As_ of late, I have noticed that

such topics as sexual harassment, S

date rape and other violent acts
against women have been given
a fair share of attention in your
paper. [...] -

LETTERS A

I would like to talk about a part
of my life that only ‘a handful of
family and close friends are
aware of. As a growing child, 1
was exposed to such conflicting
situations concerning people and
women that, even today as a man
in his early 20s, haunt me.

The household I grew up in
was a violent one with a hateful,
mean—spirited father and a mother
who was taught, as her main goal
in life, to be wife and mother. 
The conflicts of those times have
left each and every one of my
brothers and sisters, including
myself, with some sort of scar.
My father was hate, with every

 

proclaimed himself to [have the]
authority to beat people under his
roof, and he took fulladvantage
of it.

The most damaging part of his
hate that was directed toward me
was his attempt to-perpetuate the
intense hate he had and still has
for women.

”Women. are whores, son,”
”Never get married,” ”Never
trust them," and ’’Your mother is
a bitch, just like the rest of them,”
were some of his famous quotes.

Whether I felt he was right or
wrong at the time, I do not
remember, but I speculate that
having such exposure to this did
confuse me about my attitude
toward women. This confusion
w.as coupled with my inability to
fit into my s'choo|’s social [life],
creating the classic introverted
loner. If I would have continued
[on] this path, I know today that

- I would be what my father stood

for and possibly even worse.
Regrettably, I, must .tell you that.

_ even though lyhavethrown out " 

         

 

the philosophies of my father, I'm
still troubled by them. If I were to
tell you who I am and that I still
allow such a thing to prevent me
from having a life with relation-

ships, you wouldn’t believe it. ~.

How does all of this tie into the
violence committed against
women? It is my father who is the
link. He is among the ranks of

grown men whobelieve in such _

hatred, who practice it_ and take
pride in it. They do not struggle
to find the truth; to them their

hatred is the truth. It is this en- "

graining of hatred and the attempt
[to perpetuate] it that is a central

root of this problem insociety. In .

closing, I would like .to. share

\ these words by Lao-Tzu, because

I find them most fitting to me and
to the others who are either strug-
gling or continuing the per-
petuation. - A

”One who conquers others is ‘

strong. One who conquers him-
self is mighty."  - '

THE PITT NEWS

As you are reading this column,
many students, yourself included
perhaps, are marking off the time
until summer vacation arrives.

Many, if not most, can't wait
until May. There will be vaca-
tions in Florida, California,
Hawaii and maybe even Europe.
I, for one, regret the heralding of
summer.

For me, summer does not
mean the three ”B”s (Blondes,
Buckley and Buicks). Instead it
means the three ”S”s (Slavery,

. Sleeplessness and Shelves). You

see, once I leave Pitt, I have to get
my usual summer job at a super-
market.

”What’s wrong with working at
a supermarket?”_ you might ask.‘
Well, nothing. Nothing except for
the fact that I work the graveyard
shift —— usually midnight to 8 a.m.
After two years of this shift, I can
safely say that there is nothing
like it in the summer job world.

First, there are my co-workers. «

Excluding myself, all graveyard
shifters are anywhere from 35 to

tion plot No.1: ”Something is
very wrong on the ’Holodeck.’ ”
_ The new USS Enterprise is
equipped with this amazing bit of
technology called the holodeck.
The holodeck can create the illu-
sion of any place or time that is
in the ship's computer memory.
So far this has included such
strange and fantastical locations
as 20th century Earth and 19th
century Earth. Wow. What a
stretch for the writers, to actually

think of a plot for a story taking ’

place in recent history. Luckily
for their creativity glands, they
can steal ideas from Sherlock

Holmes mysteries and '40s gang- .

ster novels.

In this particular gem ofa story-
line, which appears every three
episodes or so, some foolhardy
members of the crew go to ”have
fun” in some. ”exotic” locale,

g’ and something goes terribly‘

wrong with the computer, result-

. ing in a) the crew being trapped

Throughout her life, Marilyn
expressed the desire to be
taken seriously, as both an ac-
tress and an individual. In fact,
a friend once quoted her as
saying, .”Big breasts, big ass,

‘ big deal. Can't I be anything

else?” Perhaps as part of the
feminist movement Marilyn
would have found the oppor-
tunity she desired to become
something else.

She appears to have been a
sort of a ”closet intellectual.”
Though she did not finish high
school, she possessed a curi-
ositydescribed as ”childlike”
and surprised many people
with her knowledge of
Dostoevski and her interest in
Lincoln Steffens. But her in-

tellectual pursuits were dis-

OK guy, he could be a tyrant at

over the way I dressed. Steve
complained that my dress (cut-off
jeans, T-shirt) would send nega-
tive vibes to the customers. I ex-
plained that anyone stupid

enough to shop at three in the_

morning, and believe me, there
were wackadoos in the store all
night, didn't deserve or shouldn't
expect to see a minimum-wager
donning a tux.

This brings me to my next
point: the customers. First", I must
say that I was afraid when I first
started this gig that anybody
shopping in the ”wee small hours

of” would either be a vampire, ax

murderer, or a lunatic. If only it
were that simple. These people
were weird! '

People buy the most bizarre
items at night. I'd see one lady
come in and buy a spatula, a toy
hotdog that squeaked and a plun-
ger, and I’d think, ”What in‘ hell

either emerge from the deck or
otherwise affect the operations of
the ship from within. _

Obviously, the writers of the
show are so entranced with the
”possibilities” for pirating story
ideas from every piece of popu-
lar art from the last 200 or 300
years that they should create a
spinoff of the show, dealing pure-
Iy with the holodeck — Holo
Deck: The Next Generation.
How thrilling. I wait with bated
breath for the coming of the fall
television season.

0 Star Trek: The Next Genera-
tion plot No.2:. ”Hey, wow,
some strange godlike alien is toy-
ing with the Enterprise in order to

exist as a race.”

Seen on the original Trek, this V

one is always awinner. As the
crew is beset with all kinds of
strange powers buffeting the ship

and coming from. the strange,
phenomenon that they have been _

observing, they slowly come to
realize that_they are being tested.

Had she lived even another
decade, she would have ex-

women demanded the seri-
ousness that she sought. And
though it's unlikely that this

_ woman, who made a career of

her body, would have become
Gloria Steinem, exactly, it is
conceivable that she, would
have been granted more seri-
ous roles as an actress. (At

least-she might have read a

My job at the supermarket was
two—fold. Although sometimes I
had to join the ”Zoo Crew" in
stocking shelves, my main job
was to keep the floor clean.
Sweeping and mopping were
backbreaking, but I did get to
play with the ominous BUFFER.
This lawn mower-sized machine
not only shined the floor but also
destroyed everything in its path.

During my tenure with the
buffer, I was able to demolish
three watermelons, a IO—pound
sack of kitty litter and an elderly
couple in the deli aisle.

One of the negative aspects of‘

working during the night is-hav—

ing to sleep during the day. '

When you sleep during the day,

. people think you're lazy_. ”Why

do you sleep so much?” my
father would ask. I said, ”Because
I worked last night.” Of course
his reply was, ”Work? You call
that work? Why, when I was your
age I was a hit-man for the Scran-

Federation space for too terribly

long gets picked up by one of»

these "superior" beings and test-
ed. OK? So, let's make a modest
estimate and say that there are 20
or so starships floating about aim-
lessly for these creatures to test.
And since the Enterprise has been
nailed five or six times in two sea-
sons, we'll call five the average

number of times a ship can ex- '

pect to be tested for the overall
worth of humanity. Five times 20

. equals 100. So, over two seasons

of time, there have been 100 tests
of humanity by alien creatures’.

Now,_the admittedly spectacu-
lar crew of the Enterprise has only
squeaked by these little spot in-

spections. I figure at Least 20 of

these tests of other starships just
had to have been failures, and so,

.with any luck, by the time the

next season rolls around, the Fed-
eration will have been anni-
hilated.

Santoro takes second straight championship

By Mike Rampa

Staff Writer

Pat Santoro retained his title as
national champion at 142 pounds
when he defeated Arizona State's
Junior Saunders in overtime at the
59th annual NCAA Wrestling
Championships.

Santoro won 6-6, 1-1, criteria

10; meaning he had the riding
time advantage in overtime to
seal the victory.

Santoro leaves Pitt with an
amazing 20-4 record in NCAA
tournament competition.

Santoro, usually a soft-spoken
and reserved individual, raced
into the stands to hug his father
after the decision was an-

nounced.

Pitt Coach Rande Stottlemyer
said in the Pittsburgh Press, ”The
second title means more than the
first. The losses he had this year
just forced him to step it up a
notch.” T . k

Santoro had lost to No.1‘-"
ranked Mike Cole from Clarion
University three times this year.

NCAA tourney quiz No.9:.
What do Lou ' Campanelli,
Dick Tarrant, Kevin Mackey,
Jimmy Lynam and Paul Evans
have in common?

All are past coaches of fa-
mous NCAA Tournament un-
derdogs who, regardless of
their respective past blazes of
March Madness glory,- have
been just terrible in the
NCAAs, if they even got there.

Campanelli, currently the
coach at California, led super-
upstart James Madison to
second-round play in 1982
and 1983, only to lose to
powherhouse North Carolina
in both years. In '82, Carolina,
the eventual champions of the
Tournament, nipped the
Dukes by merely two points,
52-50. ‘

"Since Ie'aving"JMU at the
end of the '83 season, Cam-
panelli and his California
Golden Bears haven't been
within a paw swipe of the
NCAAS. And for your informa-

Whatever happened to coaches
of past Tournament underdogs?

tion, James Madison hasn't
been either.

Tarrant? He was behind the
marvelous run by Richmond
in last year's tourney, in which
the Spiders blew past Indiana
and Georgia Tech before bow-
ing to Temple in the regional
semifinals. ‘

Oh, how the media loved
Tarrant. He was frequently
referred to as one of the best
unknown coaches in America ‘
by lots of publications after last
season's exploits.

This year, though, Tarrant
and Richmond weren't as ap-
pealing, and the two were
forced to settle for the NIT.
Maybe next year.

Kevin Mackey Twas the
coach of the 1986 Cleveland
State Vikings, the team that
snuck out of the C3PO, no,
that wasn't it... the AMCU-8,
yeah, the Association of Mid-
Continent\Universities, and
into the NCAAs. Everyone
laughed at the thought of what
damage an AMCU-8 entry
could do in the tourney until

and St. Joseph's before losing
a heartbreaker to, Navy (which
will be discussed later), 71-70.

The reason Mackey hasn't
been heard from since? Good
ol’ Cleveland State got them-
selves into trouble with the
NCAA itself and is currently
on -its‘ last year of probation.

Jimmy Lynam was the head
coach of a team that commit-
ted one of the all-time great
upsets in NCAA Tournament
history. In 1981, DePauI was
ranked No.1 in the nation and
was the clear favorite to win
the national championship.
But St. Joe's, after squeezing
past Creighton, bumped off
the heavily favored Blue De-
mons on John Smith's last-
second layup, 49-48. _

The surprising Hawks then
advanced to the regional finals
by nipping Boston College.
The pasting St.’ Joe's then
receiveélfrom Iridi‘ana‘-‘is irrele-_
vant. But Lynam, acting on his
newfound popularity, left St.
Joe's after the season to be-
come the head man for that

_ is now,”

the Vikings thrashed Indiana

In the process, Santoro lost his
No.1 national ranking.

Cole was upset by Saunders in
the semifinals.

Santoro, a normally aggressive
and quick-to-strike wrestler, wres-
tled Saunders defensively for the
entire match.

Once the bout went into over-
time, Santoro felt he ‘ had the

edge.

”I thought I could outlast him,
out-condition him,” Santoro said.

”He won here, he was pinned
here,” Stottlemyer said.

’’All those experiences helped
him. You don't get, too many

Panthers. good enough

to come back after loss 

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

Indianapolis, Ind. — ”BalI U,
Ball U, Ball U.”

That is about all that could be
heard throughout the Indianapo-
Iis Hoosier Dome Thursday night
as the Ball State-Cardinals ended
the Pitt Panthers’ 1989 season
with a 68-64 victory in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament.

It was a tough game for Pitt to
lose. After falling behind big ear-

. ly on, they battled back in the

second half without star Brian
Shorter (who was on the bench
with four fouls) to go up by
seven.

ANALYSIS

Then, pretty much like Pitt's
whole season has gone, the
Cardinals came backto win.

”I’ve never heard of Ball State
before, but I know who Ball State
Pitt forward Rod
Brookin said. ”They are a good
team.” ‘

What about this Pitt team? They
started five sophomores (Sean

at center) for most of the season, 1 ‘.
andused primarily six players "

throughout the season.

They lost to teams like Du- I

quesne (80-76) and Boston Col-
Iege (95-83), but beat teams like

- Georgetown (79-74) and Oklaho-

ma (99-91).‘

Was this a team of over- I

I achievers? Probably not.

More likely, they were a team
with a lot of talent and youth who
made young mistakes and didn't
really know how good they were.

Shorter came in, after sitting out

last season, to fill a lot of holes _‘
that were left by the departure of ‘a

Charles Smith and Jerome Lane.

He averaged over 20» points '

and close -to 10 rebounds per
game. He was named the Big East

Indianapolis, Ind. — Without a
doubt, the absolutely best place

' This revelation came to me
while I was in Indianapolis to see

weekend. Not knowing that the
Panthers would lose 68-64 Thurs-
day night, we reserved a room for
two nights. When the Panthers
lost, we had two free days in In-

We arrived around four in the
afternoon on Thursday. The game
ended around midnight; it was an
emotional game, back and forth
all the way to the buzzer. The rest
of the night was pretty much shot.

Friday was a different story.
First-round NCAA Tournament
games started at noon on Friday.
The Jackson Street Bar boasted
two big-screen TVs for basketball
fans, so we decided to give it a
try. It wasn't very crowded then,
so we sat at the bar and ordered
a couple beers.

question of the day.

FormerJPitt-coach ERidI has a few

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

Now that the NCAA Tourna-
ment is upon us, former Pitt
basketball coach Charles ”Buzz”
Ridl has spoken out about the
successful Pitt team he once
coached as compared to the Pan-
thers of today.

Ridl coached from 1968-75
and posted a 97-85 overall
record. His most successful sea-
sons came in ’73—74 and ’74—75,
when Pitt reached postseason
tournaments for the first time in
10 years.

Ridl’s Panthers went 25-4 in
1974, winning 22 straight, and
advanced to the NCAA Eastern
Regional Finals where they were
defeated by North Carolina State
TOO-72.

In 1975, the Panthers finished
with an 18-11 record and made
it to the second round of the NIT
Tournament.

Ridl is considered to be one of
the most successful basketball
coaches ever to come through
Pitt's athletic program.

Bruce, Kieth Starr, Mickey Mar-
tin and Lew Hill on his 1973-75
teams.

Those were successful years for
Buzz, but they came at the ex-
pense of four years of mediocrity
and frustration.

The Panthers of today have
been, at times, capable of play-
ing with anyone in the country,
and at times capable of losing to
teams they should have beaten
easily.

important similarity between his
highly successful teams of
yesteryear and the Panthers
today.

”One of our big strengths back
then was having Bill [Knight],”
Ridl said. ”A star player can real-
ly motivate a team when they're
having trouble. Bill went on to be
a great success in professional
basketball, and I think that Brian
Shorter has the same potential.

”In his first season, Shorter has

The similarities seem to end
there.
”They start five sophomores
and only play six guys,” Ridl said.
”Back when we were playing,
we had more depth to work with.

the leading scorer in several
games and was one of the more
consistent players for Pitt.

”I’d have to say that we are a
good team that [won't] lose any-
body to graduation,” Matthews
said. ”We have to go back this
summer and work together. We
have to hit the weight room and
work on the individual weakness-
es that we all have, and we'll be
fine.”

Miller became more a pure

- point-guard for the Panthers this

season. He shot the ball when the
team needed it, and when he was
hot he could take over a game.
Thething with Miller was that he
needed to penetrate the lane
more to open up the outside shot.

Porter played mostly forward
this season but was used some-
times as a guard. He wasn't afraid

to take the ball inside or launch _

the outside shot.

Porter was best, it seemed,
when the odds were against him.
Against Georgetown, he wasn't
afraid to take the ball inside

.against the Hoya big men. He

was able to fire Pitt up.

As one scout said during the
Ball State game, ”Porter is the
typical Georgetown player; he
has no true position. He is a great
defensive player and has a knack
for the ball. He reminds me of an

-old Georgetown guard from the

early '80s named Eric Smith. He
can do everything.”

Martin had an up-and—down
season playing out of position at
center. Part of the time he was
able to hold ‘his own, but other

times he looked outmatched.
Brookin was able ‘to provide

the spark from the bench this sea-
son that the Panthers needed last
season. He scored his career—high
24 points against Connecticut
late in the season, but was the

   
 

, New York, NY 10016.

 

catalyst for Pitt all year.

”For my 2‘/2 years here, I think
this is the best team that I have
been associated with," Brookin
said. ”We didn't have the real big
star, and I think we had a good
season. I am happy with,.the way
we did.”

Whatever the reason Pitt left
the I989 tourney in the first
round is just history now — it
doesn't really matter. This team
did a lot of things that were not
expected of them. With the qual-
ity of recruits they have coming
in and the talent they have com-
ing back, the Panthers should be
a team to be reckoned with next
season.

East as the ’amoeba defense.’ We
were always changing and shift-
ing and trying to disguise what
we were doing to throw the op-
posing team off balance. I could
use guys like Lew Hill, Ken
Wagoner and Keith Starr with
confidence.”

Given that the game of basket-
ball has changed over the last 14
years with the introduction of
such things as the three-point line
and players being allowed to
dunk, Ridl sometimes wonders
how his team would have per-
formed under the present-day

rules. .

”Our big men back then were
great perimeter shooters and
finesse players because we didn't
have the luxury of dunking the
ball,” Ridl said. '

’’I think if dunking were al-
lowed, it would have com-
plemented our offense and
opened up an entirely new offen-
sive plan for us. It would have
diversified our scoring.

”The dunking rule has made
basketball more of a power
game; it's changed the game dra-
matically.”

Navy has had the most success
of all these sleeper leaders.
Evans, with his All-America
center David Robinson, buried
LSU in the first round of the
1985 tournament before los-
ing a heartbreaker to Maryland
in the following round.

The next season, Evans guid-
ed the Midshipmen past a

to eventual national runner-up

Evans then moved on to
Pittsburgh after the '86 season.
Yet his highly-talented Pan-
thers have fared rather poorly
in NCAA tournament play,
losing second-round games to
Oklahoma in 1987 and Van-
derbilt in 1988, before bowing
to Ball State in this year's first
round, 68-64.

But one thing you can't call

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 20, I989

Indiana

Continued from page 9

”Ball State,” I answered not so
proudly.

The rest of the night went pret-
ty much the same way until the
Indiana game came on. Then the
music ceased and everybody
stopped talking and watched the
game. They cheered when things
went their way and yelled when
they didn't. It was just like being
there; ,

We went back to the motel
around three in the morning;
that’s when bars close in Indiana.
We got up the next day, ate
breakfast and decided to go back
to the same place for the Illinois-
Ball State game. We got-there
around I p.m. and the game was
scheduled to start at 2:20 p.m.

When we got in, it was already
pretty‘ crowded. The Duke—West
Virginia game was on TV and
everybody seemed to be rooting
for the Mountaineers, probably"
for the same reason they chant-
ed for Princeton.

The place was wild while the

hoopies stayed with No.l—seeded
Duke, but in the end, ”Duke’s ex-
perience and defensive tenacity
took the game,” according to a
localexpen.

Next up was the Illinois game.
The Fighting lllini are hated Big
Ten rivals of IU, so most of the
people were for Ball State (a small
school in northern Indiana). We
were sitting in the Ball State sec-
tion of the bar, but were hoping
that Illinois would win.

About midway through the first
half, with Illinois up by about IO,
the Illini fans started yelling,
”Here we go lllini, here we go!”

But that was soon drown out by
chants of ‘Bali U, Ball U.”

At halftime I walked over to the
the Illinois section to see what
was going on. They were just as
friendly as the people the other
night. Their team was winning,
and there was no reason to be
mad.

One of them asked me who I
was for. Naturally I said Illinois,

and they gave me a beer and we
started talking. When I men-
tioned that I was a reporter for
Pitt, they were a little taken
aback.

”Well, you know,” one said,
”we couldn't get tickets for the
game, and it is all Pitt's fault.”

When I asked why, they re-
plied, ”If that damn team would
have beaten Ball, there would
have been plenty of tickets
around.” I

The game was never really in
doubt, as the lllini rolled to a
72-60 victory. The BSU fans
cheered anyway and wished the
Illinois fans luck in the next
round. , ’

You really can't get the true-

feeling without being there, but
if you ever get a chance to.to
watch a game in basketball-crazy
Indiana, do it.

When it comes to appliances,
every country makes its own
rules. Voltages, cycles, TV and
video standards just-aren't the
same overseas as they are
here in the USA. There are TVS
and VCRs that would work
equally well both here and
abroad, but you shouldn't ex-
pect that your local Sears will
be able to supply your needs...
or even know what they are.

That's why there's Appliances
Overseas. Twenty- nine years
worth of experience that makes
us expert in all the things you'll
need to know.

Appliances Overseas stocks
a complete line of large and ,
small home appliances for all

assures prompt shipment. And
we canship anywhere in the

Hoyas survive game against Fightinglrish 9

(AP) — The second—ranked and
top-seeded Hoyas survived
another hair-raising upset bid
Sunday in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, beating Notre Dame 81-74
after trailing at halftime.

Charles Smith scored 28 of his
34 points in the second half for
Georgetown, which squeaked
past last—seeded Princeton 50-49
in "an East Regional first-round
game that Thompson said the

Hoyas should have lost.

”We didn’t play as well as we
would have liked here, and that's
attributed to the game with
Princeton, it was such a strain,”
Thompson said. ’’I want to get
out of here, go home, get
pumped up and angry at practice
and forget the way we played.”

Rodney Monroe scored a
career-high 40 points for N.C.
State, including 11 in the second
overtime, and hit baskets that tied
the score at the end of regulation
and the first overtime. Monroe
gave Iowa the lead for goodgat
86-85 with a three-pointer with
4:00 left in the second overtime.
His three—point play made it
91-87 with 3:06 to play, and he
hit another three-pointer with
