school
dean
resigns

By Stephen
Kozarovich
News Editor

The dean of Pitt’s
Graduate School of
Public and
International Affairs
has resigned under
pressure from Pitt
Provost James Maher.

Dean Davis Bobrow
turned in his resigna-
tion, effective immedi-
ately, Friday afternoon
at the request of
Maher.

The resignation was
requested because of
“a difference in man-
agement philosophy
and style,” according
to Pitt Director of
Communications Ken
Service.

Bobrow said his
style of management
and suggestion that the
graduate school be
treated with more
importance may have
been too forceful for
Maher.

In a letter to the uni-
versity community,
Maher wrote that
Bobrow will assume a
position as a faculty
member in the school
and that the retired Pitt
administrator Edison
Montgomery will
assume the position of
interim dean until a
permanent dean is
found.

Maher did not return
several phone calls.

Literature course takes a different look at the Bible

By Ellen Litman
For The Pitt News

In a Monday evening lecture, the stu-
dents’ attention is focused on a profes-
sor who is telling stories, asking opin-
ions and playing one character after
another. Stories are followed by unusu-
al examples, and jokes lead to unex-
pected questions.

It is possible to forget that it is a lec-
ture, but it is a lecture by Professor
David Brumble, who is teaching the
class “Bible as Literature.”

“It is exciting to be in front of [an]
audience,” Brumble said. Even though

there are about 100 people in his class,
Brumble said he knows it is possible to
speak to individuals.

“It is fun working with students, to
draw things out of them, to tease them,

play with their expectations  It is
always interesting to see what interests
the class, even the class that big.

“The main thing is I really like these
stories. I like working with literature,

. reading stories, talking about sto-
ries,” Brumble said. “I’ve loved to do it
since I was a child.”

Brumble has worked at the University
of Pittsburgh for 24 years. He received
his bachelor degree in literature at
Portland State University.

At the graduate school of the
University of Nebraska Brumble stud-
ied literature and linguistics.

Brumble said his areas of interest
include different subjects. “The Bible
is my favorite course,” he said. He said
his purpose in the course is not theolog-
ical. Instead he looks at the stories as

GROZNY — There was a lull
in fighting in the capital of
Chechnya yesterday following a
48-hour cease—fire declared by
Russia.

However, prospects for peace
appear dim as Russian sniper

tial palace.

Russian authorities accused
the Chechen rebels of ignoring
the cease—fire declared by the
Kremlin but said Russian troops
were abiding by the truce.

Russian government state-
ments, issued after several days
of ﬁerce fighting in the Chechen

hour cease—frre was intended to
end bloodshed and asked
Chechen rebels to put down
their weapons. .— Reuters A

LOS ANGELES — President
Bush’s charity, launched in
1990, spent more than $22 mil-

while giving only about $4 mil-

day.

Quoting unnamed expertson
volunteerism, the newspaper
said the Points of Light
Foundation had, “the look of a
wasteful, Washington—dependent
operation.”

The foundation had received
$26.6 million in federal funds —
more than half its budget --
while incurring a wide range of
costs that amount to question-
able spending, the volunteerism
experts said.

According to the Times, only
11 percent of the foundation’s

Pitt's Nations in Crisis program focuses on Bosnia

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

School children learn in church
basements to escape shelling in some
parts of the former Yugoslavia. Their
volunteer teachers substitute for those
who have ﬂed the country or died.

“Some students literally can’t con-
centrate now because of all the
chaos,” said the director of Pitt’s
Institute for International Studies,
Seth Spaulding.

Monday night, three Pitt faculty
members left for a three-week mis-
sion to study the condition of the
educational systems in Bosnia-
Hercegovina and to evaluate how to
improve it. I

The mission is part of Pitt’s
Nations in Crisis program. Pitt would
like to set up a center in Bosnia this
year which would, among other
actions, help to set up emergency
training for new teachers, supply
building and curricula materials and
study how a nation’s educational sys-
tem recovers from socio—economic
destruction.

These studies would allow acade-
mics and experts to learn from each
other and enable them to reach
beneath temporary solutions,

Spaulding said.

“We’re trying to move beyond
emergency aid to a long—term pro-
gram to reconstruct the schools and
refinance them,” Spaulding said.
“We’re not in the business for knowl-
edge for..-

Pitt is currently negotiating a con-
tract to set up the center, Spaulding
said. The main obstacle will be find-
ing the funds to pay for core salaries,
training work, supplies and commu-
nication. The only way to get infor-

transfer A 20-

from communism to a more continen-
tal system of government, the
Bosnians needed help in restructuring
their educational system, Spaulding
said. The fighting, which has deplet-
ed the teacher supply and student
concentration, has thickened the chal-
lenge.

“It’s not just the physical system
that’s been destroyed, but you have
many people who have ﬂed or killed,
so you have understaffed systems at
all levels. So finding people that can
be trained [is] not easy.”

line fax from Sarajevo would cost
$20, he said.

Other groups in the United States
have contributed to the effort, supply-
ing textbooks and other teaching
materials, Spaulding said.

Pitt’s participation began last fall
when UNICEF invited Spaulding to
act as a consultant to evaluate how to
restructure the educational system of
Bosnia—Hercegovina. He travelled
through war—torn areas in October.

During the current three-week mis-
sion, program coordinator Lynn

Cohen and graduate student Michel
Rakotomanana will travel with
UNICEF escorts to areas where they
will evaluate the educational facili-
ties. -

Bev Marcinitzyn, the grants coordi-
nator, will set up an office in Split.
She will have to take care of details
like transportation, getting ﬂack jack-
ets, helmets and bullet-proof vests,
among more complicated budgeting
projects, Spaulding said.

Although they will travel with
UNICEF escorts, some dangers may
surface, Spaulding said. When travel-
ling and crossing certain lines, offi-
cials may search their bags or confis-
cate film, he said.

“There’s a degree of danger, but not
severe,” Spaulding said. “If the situa-
tion is unstable, they could be in a
city that could get some shelling.
Chances are they won’t be in a situa-
tion of physical danger  but you
never know when there’ll be a
sniper.”

Spaulding spoke with the team after
they arrived.

“None of them had been there
before, and they were surprised that
Zagreb is such a lovely city,” he said.
They will travel to Sarajevo
Thursday, he said.

tional style, as well as the number and type of
potential benefits available to candidates. For
example, employment in a Fortune 100 com-
pany often means a competitive starting
salary, great benefits and work locations
throughout the country. By contrast, a small
start—up company may offer an informal work
atmosphere, plenty of responsibility from day
one and a chance to move rapidly up the hier-

. archy as the organization grows. Which of

these and the host of other possible work
environments to choose is up to each individ-
ual, but knowing the size of the company
prior to an interview will help you to focus
your discussion with the recruiter on how
you’d fit in with their unique environment.
-What’s the organization ’s style or philos-
ophy? Sounds a little vague, but this question
is often the most important one to research.
Every company has their own approach to
their clients and to fulfilling organizational
goals. It may be reflected in a corporate
motto (“Quality is Job I.’’), or in statements
by the CEO or president. Identifying this
approach and communicating it to an inter-
viewer makes a powerful and positive state-
ment about you as a candidate. For example,
if you told a recruiter at the onset of your
interview that her organization’s commitment
to customer service attracted you due to your
own experiences in working with clients and
solving their problems, you’ve already gone a
long way towards establishing both your
skills and your suitability as an employee.
Where do you look for this information?
There are a lot of different sources, but here

are a few ideas to get you started. For larger
companies, annual reports are usually readily
available. However, instead of trying to read
and understand everything in the report, focus
on the ‘President’s Letter to the Shareholders’
and ‘Operating Highlights’ (sometimes called
‘The Year in Review’) sections. These will
give you a summary of how the company is
doing and where they’re headed. The
President’s Letter will often give you a good
idea of the organization’s philosophy or
approach.

Small, privately-owned firms can be a bit
tougher to research. If time permits, contact
these firms prior to interviews, and have cor-
porate literature mailed to you. In the case of
local organizations, it’s a good idea to travel
to the company and pick up the information
in person. And even if you can’t find any
information about a particular firm, it often
helps to have some insights about industries.
Knowing something about the environmental
remediation industry, for example, will help
you in interviews with any company working
in that field. One excellent source of informa-
tion on industry groups is Business Week's
annual Industry Outlook issue. It can be
found in the periodicals section of the library.
While you’re there, you can also peruse the
Business Periodicals Index for other recent
articles about particular companies or indus-
tries.

Information about many companies that
recruit Pitt graduates is available in our
Employment Library. Stop by Room 224 of
the William Pitt Union, or call 648-7130 for
more details.

sity,” Wion said. “That message is competition is
desired and exclusive coverage is not desired.”

Faculty Assembly President James Holland
addressed concerns that if HealthAmerica were to‘
become the soul coverage provider at Pitt, it would
work with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

“I am not anti-med school, and I’m not anti-UHN
(United Health Network), but we need a competitive
model,” Holland said.

Also passed around the meeting was a summary of
conclusions outlined by the subcommittee of the
Senate Benefits on Welfare Committee. _

According to the subcommittee, the university
should take a proactive role, rather than only respond-
ing to choices presented by the insurance companies.

“We feel that Pitt could obtain comparable or greater
long-term savings,” the subcommittee said, “And pro-
vide for a wider selection of providers for employees
by maintaining competition among our existing insur-
ance carriers instead of developing exclusive carrier
relationships.”

The subcommittee outlined the conditions by which
Pitt should ask for firm prices under an insured plan
agreement: I

-Blue Cross and HealthAmerica should provide
prices based on a standard HMO benefit package.

°Both carriers would be notified that Pitt would
modify the employer/employee unit sharing of premi-
ums, to provide basic coverage to be paid by the uni-
versity and any incremental costs above the basic
package to be paid by the employee.

Holland said they wanted the issue to be decided by

the end of March, giving faculty enough time to set re-

enrollments.

literature. “I am trying to understand
stories in their historical context.”

Talking about the Bible, Brumble
uses a lot of examples from autobi-
ographies of American Indians. He
said he is interested in the way
Indians imagined themselves.

“The self was thought of in rela-
tion to the community, tribe, family.
In America today people tend to
think of themselves very individual-
ly, in terms of personal goals.”

Medieval and Renaissance litera-
ture is also an important part of
Brumble’s work.

“I just finished a book on medieval
and Renaissance uses of classical
mythology,” Brumble said.

He has translated several medieval
poems from Latin and a play, “The
Spanish Brabanter,” from Dutch.

Now he works on translating 17th
century Dutch mythology. “I enjoy
translating,” Brumble said.

Twenty-four years of work at the
same university is a long time.

“It allows me to teach pretty much
what I want to teach. The university
and the department has been very
good to me in encouraging me to fol-
low my interests,” he said.

Brumble also said he likes that

when he worked as an interim direc-
tor of the university libraries for year
and half.
“It was very exciting. New things,
new people,” he said. _

Brumble emphasized that the uni- Brumble said he does not

versity offers a lot of opportunities.
He has participated in the “Semester
at Sea” program twice. He also had a
chance to try administrative work

encounter serious problems in the
life of the university. Yet he said he
wishes there were more athletic
facilities on campus for students and

faculty.

“I’d like to see some new squash
courts,” he said. “I think college
football is silly and college basket-
ball is silly. Silly for the university
to pay so much attention to it, but it
is not silly to have people like me
and students playing sports.”

Talking about cultural life on cam-
pus, Brumble said he regrets the
closing of The Pittsburgh Playhouse.-

“The playhouse was important for

many people. That is going to be a

real gap.”

Brumble said he thinks it is not a
perfect solution to show the same
kind of movies at the Rex theater in
the South Side. ‘‘It is going to be
more difficult for students to get to
South Side.”

Brumble said he has done a lot of
interesting and exciting things at Pitt
and that he appreciates that the uni-
versity made it possible.

“I’ve been lucky. I am at the uni-
versity that allows me to pursue a lot
of different interests.”

Big Brother is watching

The flap over restrictions on the Internet at Carnegie-
Mellon University has died down for the time being. It is
in this time that the University of Pittsburgh has appointed
an ad hoc committee which has already drafted a plan for
restricting some forms of pornography over the Internet.
This proposal has been passed on for administrative
review. The committee was composed of students, faculty
and staff, with sociology professor Norman Hummon as its
chairman. Pitt is expected to decide whether or not to
impose restrictions on Internet access sometime within the
month. -

In a lemming-like move, the University of Pittsburgh
seems prepared to follow Carnegie-Mellon’s lead in
restricting access to the information in the electronic ether.
This is the most undesirable option open to Pitt. Both
schools are afraid that minors will have access to the
pornographic materials and thus that they will violate
Pennsylvania obscenity laws. Yet, these universities are not
here to serve minors as their primary purpose. They must
remember that they must be responsive to the needs of
their students. The administration should not use the lawas
an excuse to impose their standards of obscenity on the
university community.

Universities exist to promotefree inquiry and exchange
of information and ideas. With restrictions placed on
Internet access, barriers are being erected around one of
the richest sources of information and avenues of free
expression. The question of what is useful to whom must
not be determined for the majority by an oligarchy of tech-
nocrats. ' .

Censorship in any area can lead to a lock down on all
areas. To allow it to begin anywhere is an open invitation
to allow its intrusion everywhere.

Instead of locking out all students, the restrictions should
be placed on the students whose use would violate the
obscenity laws. There should be alternate sites for those
students who want or need unrestricted access to the
Internet. It would be a similar situation to what occurs in
the library where pornographic materials are place within
special collections. While this situation is not a perfect
answer, it would at least make for a reasonable compro-

lmise which would help preserve some of the university’s

integrity.

The question is one of whether or not the students are
being deemed capable of deciding for themselves what
they want to access. When a student looks at a bulletin
board, he should be able to decide for himself whether this
is something he wants to associate himself with. Good taste
ought to be allowed to prevail in these questions. Allow
social stigmas to regulate the Internet before Big Brother.

Fear and loathing on New Year’s

recent opinion poll
conducted on 17 peo-
ple, most of whom

were my friend Paul, showed
that everybody was expecting
this New Year’s to be some-
thing special, due to the fact
that the new year in question
was 1995. Most people
thought this meant that there
were only five years left until
the 21st century.

In fact, there are six years
left, mostly because a centu-
ry is one hundred years long.
This in itself wouldn’t mat-
ter, except that back when
Jesus’ mother decided to
commemorate her labor pains
by basing a calendar on
them, she carelessly forgot
the year zero; as a result of
her negligence, the A.D. cal-
endar, which stands for After
B.C., began with the year 1,
so that the first century didn’t
end until the end of the year
100, and therefore the 20th
century won’t end until the
end of the year 2000. It is
amazing how many people
are unable to grasp this.

One of these people is My
Friend, who dragged me into
New York City (Land Of A
Thousand Mysterious Odors)
on New Year’s Eve because
she wanted to watch The Ball
drop. The Ball, for the sake
of those blessed few who
don’t know, is a sizable mass
of bloated Christmas lights
that hangs on top of a tall
stick in Times Square, a
place which was named by a
city administrator who was
way too much into math. The
Ball sits on top of the stick
every Dec. 31 until 11:59
p.m., at which time it moves
down the stick with an aston-
ishing lack of anything
resembling speed.

It should be noted that I did
not want to go to New York
on New Year’s Eve, as I am
the sort of person whose idea
of fun involves activities on a

smaller ‘scale, like playing
with Legos. My friend
promised that we would NOT
be going into the city, but
rather that we would be
spending a quiet evening at
the home of her roommate’s
parents, who just HAP-
PENED to live mere
moments away from the city,
not that that mattered or any-
thing. Thus was I reassured,
in much the same way that a
total idiot might be.

So at 10:30 p.m., we were
driving into New York City.
What this means is that we
almost suffered nine distinct-
ly separate violent deaths
every two seconds. Trying to
drive in New York City on a
normal day closely resembles
trying to run THROUGH the
planet Jupiter. At 10:30 p.m.
on New Year’s Eve, it’s like
doing that with your
shoelaces tied together.

Finally, we parked the car

‘on the corner of 48th Street

and Ninth Avenue (named by
the same administrator who
named Times Square). We
got out of the car, and dis-
covered it was raining.
“Where’s the umbrella?” I
asked My Friend. “We don’t
have one,” she said. “Ha ha!”
I said, “That sure was a
funny joke! Would you hand
me an umb_rella now,
please?”. _

We were able to walk a
good two blocks toward
Times Square before we ran
into the entire populations of
New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, who were also
walking toward Times
Square. A few of these peo-
ple also were there to see The
Ball. The rest of them, who
were drunk, were having
conversations like this:

PERSON #1: Happy New
Year!

PERSON #2: It’s only
10:30! What are you, drunk?

PERSON #1: Yep!

PERSON #2: Me too!

TOGETHER: I love beer!

Eventually the crowd
stopped on a street corner
where we could see The Ball
as a bright smear of light that
seemed, from our distance, to
be slightly larger than a gnat.
We stood there for 45 min-
utes until the NYPD came by
and told us to move. This
resulted in everyone moving
frantically until we ended up
two blocks further away from
The Ball than we were
before.

Finally, The Ball dropped. I
didn’t actually see it, but I
could tell that it had, because
a whole lot of beer hit me
from several directions at
once, followed by 17 metric
tons of confetti.

The moral of this story is
simple: Dick Clark must die.
For the past several historical
eras, he has been hosting
“Dick Clark’s Totally
Incredibly Wonderful New
Year’s Eve Celebratory
Gathering From Right Here
In Times Square,” which
sends the message to millions
of American TV viewers that
it sure is fun to be standing
out in the rain with a bunch
of confetti-armed drunks.

In fact, Dick himself is
nowhere NEAR the rain; he’s
in a TV studio in California,

where a crew of special

effects wizards contrive to
superimpose his image over
the footage from Times
Square.

Well, his gig is up, because
I’m sounding the battle cry:
America, reject Dick’s
hypocrisy and don’t give in
to the mindless chaos which
is New Year’s Eve!

I suggest staying home and
playing with Legos.

entire city
has been

euphorically listening to the
incessant yelping and whining
of the beaten Dawgs as they
limp back to Cleveland with
their tails tucked between their
legs. '

Now many Steeler fans
probably wouldn’t mind if this
past week lasted forever. Some
would be happy just to beat
the Browns three times and
end the season. 8

But most fans have another
goal in mind, and I’ll have to
agree that it is a realistic goal.

The Steelers are on the road
to their fifth Super Bowl. And
of all the contenders, the only
club left to possibly detour the
Blitzburgh Express is the San
Diego Chargers, a team that
defeated the Steelers 37-34 a
few weeks ago.

There is no Jim Kelly, Joe

,Montana or Dan Marino in

San Diego, only a no-name
quarterback known as Stan
Humphries who will join
perennial loser Vinny
Testaverde on the crane down-
town.

But Stan will not be the only
one to hang. The entire team
will be lynched as Pittsburgh
steamrolls their way right
through the Chargers to the
Super Bowl.

- Before San Diego even steps
on the field, they figure to be
in trouble. How many West
Coast teams look forward to
making the 2,500 mile trek to
frozen Pittsburgh in January?
The horrid weather that fans
curse about will be something
to swear by when the Chargers
freeze their way to mistakes.

Many who root for San
Diego feel that Natrone Means
will power his way through
the vaunted Steeler defense.
It’s not going to happen. San
Diego has a wannabe
Pittsburgh offense. Humphries
is inept, and Means is overrat-
ed. “Tumover” will be a big
word on head coach Bobby
Ross’ lips as these two fall
apart. They have not faced an
aggressive, steel- trap defense

Steelers,
49ers to

Super Bowl

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

AFC

On Sunday, the Steelers and
Chargers will meet to deter-
mine who will represent the
AFC in the Super Bowl.
Favored by seven points, the
formula for a Pittsburgh win is
simple, run. If Barry Foster
runs the way he did against
Cleveland, the final score may
be the same. With a strong
running attack, the passing
game opens up and Neil
O’Donnell and his receivers
will ripen.

The Chargers must run

Natrone Means and exploit the‘

only weakness in the Steeler
defense, cornerback Deon
Figures. If Means can grind
out enough yardage to give the
Chargers opportunities other
Steeler opponents have not
had, Stan Humphries will
become dangerous.

The last factor is home field
advantage. Three Rivers
Stadium will be unbelievable,
but the Steelers won’t have to

Saliba my tenure
at Pitt

drags toward an end I have
become reminiscing about
the early years I endured
here at our university.
Through my classes,
friends and occupations
that have come and gone,
two names have come to
weigh on my mind quite
heavily.

They are Paul Hackett
and Paul Evans, two of the
most hated Pauls to grace
this institution — one by
virtually every Pitt football
fan and the other mostly by
his players. You figure out
which is which.

The year of 1989 saw the
controversial dismissal of
then head football coach
Mike Gottfried and the
entrance of Paul Hackett as
new head coach.

Hackett was vaulted into

 

and often. Humphries does not
have the quick release of a
Marino nor the feet of a
Young. Watch to see Carnell

the top position by Ed
Bozik, the athletic director
at that time. For no other
reason than being the
offensive coordinator of
the world champion San
Francisco 49ers, Bozik
found his prospect quali-
fied.

Through the years of
1989-92, Hackett’s football
program went l3-20-l, and
he was fired before the last
game of the 1992 season.
That is a winning percent-
age of .382. The only Pitt
coach who has ever fin-
ished with a lower percent-
age is Sal Sunseri, the
interim coach for the last
game in ‘92.

Yet the chaos Hackett
created goes much deeper
than wins and losses.
Bringing the Pitt football
program to an all-time low,
Hackett did a miserable job
of recruiting as well as
coaching. His offensive-
minded scheme of football
suffocated what could have
beena great defense.

Riding solely on the’ arm
of Alex Van Pelt and the
feet of Curvin Richards,
both of whom were recruits
of Gottfried, Hackett pro-
vided an inconsistent

Hackett’s tenure at Pitt
was a case of a good offen-

where wanted to play at
Pitt. A solid foundation was
laid by Chipman, and Evans
was carrying on quite well.

The. 1987 incoming fresh-
man class was Evans’ best.
With the likes of Bobby
Martin, Darelle Porter,
Sean Miller, Jason
Matthews and Brian
Shorter, the Final Four
seemed not far away.

In the eight years Evans
coached here, he took Pitt
to the NCAA tournament

in Pit News Fle Poto
From 1989 to 1992 ex-Pitt football coach Paul Hackett compiled a 13-20-1 record, the low-

the first five, never
finishing beyond the sec-
ond round of the tourna-
ment.

Though his early years at
Pitt were successful
due mostly in part to
his
personality and coaching
ability even tually became
apparent.

Players despised Evans,
his personality hindered
recruiting and his coaching
was adequate at best.

Seeing how Willard has
done this year and
years past at Western
Kentucky, a Great Eight
finish at the NCAA tourn
ament would have been
the worst—case scenario
if he had the teams Evans
had.

Speculating as to how a
coach may have done
with another team is exact-
ly that, speculation. But
there is a link that supports
this angle.

If we take Hackett and
Evans together and
then pair Majors
and Willard, you will
find one noticeable differ-
ence between the two
pairs.

the Hackett/Evans package
was purchased, and Oval

Super Bowl

-From page 9

Lake, Chad Brown, Greg
Lloyd and Kevin Greene rattle
Humphries. Also, in the nickel
package, look for the hard—hit—
ting Gary Jones to lay
Humphries out.

Means will be neutralized,
finishing with less than 70
yards at best. The Steelers
rank as one of the best defens-
es in takeaways, so look for
San Diego to cough it up on
the ground and in the air.

Two factors that may hurt
the Steelers are their special
teams coverage and Eric
Bienemy. Bienemy, who spells
Means, is dangerous as a
receiver out of the backfield
and runs well up the middle.

Offensively, Pittsburgh will
grind it out on the ground
while complementing the run
through the air. San Diego’s
strong point is their defensive
line. In order to keep the game
close or to even win, they will
have to pressure O’Donnell,
who is horrible when being
rushed, and combine with a
decent linebacking crew to
stop. Foster.

On the ugly side for the
Steelers, O’Donnell will throw
at least one interception. He
needs to relax in the pocket,
and his tendency to let the ball
sail high will come back to
haunt him.

Yet, as it has done so all
year, the defense will carry
Pittsburgh — only this time
into the Super Bowl.

NFC

The late game on Sunday
features two teams who have
either been in the Super Bowl
or in the NFC championship
game for the last several years.

The two—time defending
Super Bowl champion Dallas
Cowboys, face off against the
potent San Francisco 49ers at
Candlestick Park. The experi-
ence of winning two champi-
onships will help the
Cowboys, but that may be it.

with a re-injured hamstring
pull and a defense whose sec-
ondaiy has been average, San
Fran will be too much.
Although the game may turn
out to be close early on, look
to see Steve Young and his
passing attack wear the
Cowboys down. The 49ers
have, without question, the
best secondary in the league.
Showcasing Deion Sanders
and Merton Hanks, San
Francisco will stop any threat
Troy Aikman and his core of
receivers may initiate.
Concerning predictions, the
obvious concern and spotlight
will be on Emmitt. If he is

able to play through the whole
game, he will be spelled by
Blair Thomas, who was cut by
the Patriots earlier this year.
The Cowboys need at least a
l0O—yard game from Smith,
and that is very unlikely to
happen. The keys for the
Cowboys will be Alvin Harper
and Daryl Johnston. Harper,
who has great leaping ability,
provides a deep threat and
good third-down possibilities.
If Dallas is smart, they will
look to throw to Johnston in
the flat and over the middle
for short gains.

This way, the linebackers
will have to commit to play-

action fakes and watch
Johnston out of the backfield.
In turn, that will open up lanes
for Novacek, Harper and Irvin,
as well as taking pressure off
of Aikman.

For the 49ers, they will have
to control Charles Haley, a
former 49er. If San Fran can
give Young time in the pocket,
the game will end early. Dallas
has to contain Young or he
will run all over them.

Dallas will have to come up
with defensive schemes to try
to fool Young, though that

may not be easy. The best
receiving corps lies in the
hands of head coach George
Seifert. With Jerry Rice, John
Taylor, Brent Jones and Ricky
Watters out of the backfield,
San Fran has too many
weapons.

The only way Dallasmay
have a good chance is to hold
onto the ball, not commit mis-
takes and hope that the 49ers
do the opposite.

Finally, the 49ers will
avenge Dallas.

like Pittsburgh’s all season.
Can you say interception?
Look for the San Diego
offense to wilt under the pres-
sure.

On the other side of the
ball, the running duo of Bam
Morris and Barry Foster will
roll through the Junior Seau-
led defense. Besides Seau,
name another player on the
San Diego defense. Your
guess is as good as mine.
Shaky Steeler QB Neil
O’Donnell will have another
good game. That’s because
he’ll rarely have to throw as
Morris and Foster pound their
way to the end zone. San J
Diego will be worn out by the
third quarter.

Fools will point out that the
Chargers already beat the
Steelers. Critics say that this
gives San Diego a psycholog-
ical edge. They’re kidding
themselves if they think they
played even a shell of the real
Steelers. Greg Lloyd, Rod
Woodson, Eric Green and
John L. Williams all sat. With
home—field advantage already
locked up, the game was
meaningless and the effort
was half—hearted at best.

Sunday, the men of steel
will be firing all cylinders,
and the Chargers will be
thinking about tee times for
next Sunday by halftime.

Remember the last promi-
nent athlete named Stan in
Three Rivers? It was none
other than everyone’s friend
Belinda. We all know what
happened to him.

Line up the nooses, because
Humphries and the rest of the
Chargers will join him.

Final score: 27-13 Steelers.
