C-“S” ~AWard Winner, Don

inhis honor at the Sigma Chi

'i f‘Greater participation in stu-

Break-Down Barriers

?.“If more students had the op-
portunity to travel,’’ Gartner add-
ed’, A “it would help‘ break down
the barriers." which exist in the
world. The breaking down of these
-barriers -is vital to world peace.”
"~T1i_is_was one recommendation
‘_of_ a 5-point program Gartner
submitted to ‘IF for next year’s
‘;.‘S” ‘Award. The others were
“rnaintain at least 700 dollars for

[Sedler referred to a notice to
the faculty which says: “In or-

[and to forestall any attempt at V.
[organizing a celebration, faculty

ued that some organized cele-
., ration, should be sponsored by
‘the’ administration. Dean Biddle
‘s_aid.that a victory rally could be

' cf Because of the ruling that no
pep rally could be held before

lowing petition was signed by
some 500 students:
'To the members of the 1955 Pitt

_V,hles undersigned, students of the

you, and everyone else, to know
_that‘- we do not approve of the

that the administration write a

' Travel Great Aid
“ Student travel wouldtalso be,a
great aid in demonstrating to for-
eigners the true nature of America,
according to Gartner.
“It is surprising to know that
so many foreigners think that

the gangsters are; Hollywood,
where everything is glamorous,
and Reno,” said Gartner.’ .
Gartner also emphasized the

- V1008’ years, came in second-

Dr. Thaddeus Danowski, director
of the Children’s_ Hospital Meta-_
bolic Ward.

Dr. Danowski, a graduate of the
Pitt Medical School, was appoint-V
ed, senior staff physician“ at Chil-
dren’s Hospital in 1947 and named
director of the Metabolic Ward.

' Club Type Atmosphere
Dr. Danowski is responsible
for a‘ program which annually
brings to Children’s Hospital,‘ for
a week to ten day ‘period, some
300 youngsters aﬂiliated with dia-
betes. During this period the
children live in a club type at-
mosphere, vwhile learning how
to better care for, and treat
their ‘malady. - '
‘As a result’ of this stay'at the
Hospital, the youngsters are bet-

'ter able to enjoy a fully normal
life, and participate‘ in‘ activities, _

because they have learned how to
take care of themselves, and can
recognize symptoms of a weaken-
ing in their condition. ' 

The children are not limited; to
one year, but return each suc-
ceeding year,,until they reach age
ﬁfteen, at-‘which time they trans-
fer to the supervision ofthe Falk
Clinic.  -

However, Dr. Danowski ‘still
maintains a close contact with
these people." A young woman who
was_a former member of this pro- P
gram is now in the hospital having
a baby. She receives, from Dr.
Danowski, constant attention and
aid on any problems which may
arise’ asa result ‘of her having
diabetes.

on 24‘-‘Hour Call

During the years the younger

children are attending these ses-

sions at Children’s Hospital, they

receive. the beneﬁt of ..having a
member of Dr. Danowski’s staff _on
24-hour call by phone. 1
This is provided in case‘ the
child runs up against a problem
concerning his treatment that he
feels -requires,
Sometimes, by ,talking to_ one of
the staff members, the child is able
to work out his own problem by
himself. , ~
Not only do the students bene-

But this incompetence is negligible when more ludicrous

a shoe ‘parlor. A Squirrel ‘Hill cleaner has never even

shoe store is listed with the wrong address. It moved ‘nine

months ago.

A studentwho bought goods in afore-mentioned cloth-

it either lacked the guts or common sense to take. a copy
of the paper to the, owner.. '

This is the ‘most beneﬁcial project the leading solon

Victory Taken as Matter-of-Fact‘

Look to Tomo

By Irv Rothman ‘'

S It’s difﬁcult to look to tomorrow. Foresight is
far _more an admirable trait than is hindsight, un-
admirable. And this ability to realize implications
of action ahead of time is one of the standards

‘which colleges must train students to accept.

Last week’s victory rally after the West Vir-
ginia game was one of those occasions in which
students could have shown that
they have accepted responsibili-
ty. They could have easily stood
up before the community as glad-
happy winners who knew how
to accept a win in a respectable .
manner.

It didn’t work that way.
Fun Good _

It is good to have fun once
in a while-—even to visit other
But we all: know that such visitation
cannot be" tempered. The " few . .who get out of

 

‘ hand will always manageto break some furnish-

ings or damage property. It is this aspect of vic-
tory rallies which we must realize will always be
present. — Those who are excited seldom act ration-
ally. _ . ‘
It is ‘the type of excitement that led Penn

State University students to paint their name in
tar on the Cathedral last Monday morning to paint
“Beat Pitt’ on the 'Soldiers’ andysailors’ Memorial
Hall cannons, to- attempt to; burn their school‘ ini-
tials in the lawn. This is what administration fears
Pitt students will eventually attempt.’

And, if exuberance reaches such a point, then
We may Certainly question the type of education

Follow the Leader ’ _
Within every large assembly, there are&_those"
who are easily excited. And such fever easily_._
spreads through a crowd willing to’ follow. the»:
leader. Certainly there were relatively few stLi—{—J ..
dents'who actually didn’t want classes. But -th'  
crusade to Carnegie Tech and P.C.W. (now Chathain
College) seemed in line with the general policy of-.
celebration that has swept, especially campus
schools, throughout the country. _, .‘ 
So‘ it was, in innocent fun, ,that students in-‘
terrupted classes at local colleges. In their exit
berance, a. few people conﬁscated paintings on.

Three were returned. _ . .
Oﬁicials have not yet determined whether"'.a~

had been inaccurately counted when the pictures“.
were hung, or a Pitt ﬁne arts student has it hang ‘
ing in his bedroom. ‘ 
Educate to Win A  ,
But one University professor seemed to -, sum;
up the whole Pitt attitude rather well." She stated _;
that students must ‘be re-educated to accept "vied"-'
tory. g - V 
During the Sutherland reign, when a season that
showed three losses was considered" poor, student’ ‘i
took victory as a matter-of-fact. They’d enjoy the._;
rallies after the game and move on to classes, satis
ﬁed. This is’ the expression of jubilance that«Pitt;
must accept. It doesn’t mean lack of school ‘s'piri't.J:
It means, rather, consideration of the general policy‘
and objectives ' of the University. ' »

By Nancy Jones
So you went to a football game
on Saturday. If you were in

‘Spain you might just as well

have gone to a bullﬁght on Sun-
day. You would sit in a colorful
arena instead
of a stadium
an d perhaps
you would ar-
rive at 6 p.m.
instead of 1:30
p.m.. ’

‘ Instead . of/’
seeing ~ thick-
ly —p a d d e d,
helmeted play-
ers /run onto,
the green ﬁeld
you would see
“toreros” dressed in sequined
bolero jackets and tight, silk
breeches parade into the sandy
arena in “cuadrillas,” teams.

The ofﬁcials who ‘fblow the -

whistle” to start’ the game are

"two mounted “alguac-ils’f dressed

in black 17th century costumes
who ceremoniously-ask the pres-
ident of the‘ arena for the_.keys
to open the bull pen. When the
trumpet blows there is no pig-
skin ﬂying through the air, but
rather many kilos of bull hurt-
ling into thearena,

Trumpet Sounds

The ' trumpet sounds the en-“

trance of the picador who, stiff
and erect like a Roman centur-
ion, rides on an amaciated, blind-

folded, and padded horse. The

picador, in danger of being
crushed, sits stoieally in the path

\ of the bull and infuriates him

‘ Letters To— The Editor

Pool Needed Where’s' Panther

Mr. Ed Bachman
News Editor
Dear Ed:

I read with interest your ‘edi-
torial concerning the need _ of
the University for a swimming
pool and tennis courts. I appre-
ciate very ‘much your backing
on this project, which we have
been advocating for the entire
time I have been here. Student
pressure. certainly will help us
attain that goal. I am grateful
for your comments. ' _

Best wishes.

Throwing the Bull S

into charging his mount. '
As the -- picador thrusts his
:‘vara,” a long steel-pointed pole,
into the bull’s neck-muscles there
is a collision of strength as when

the linemen of two football teams .

come together.

The frightened horse has the\\
‘ worst part. Often “el toro” gets

him backed up against the “bar-
rera,” rail, and the horse strug-

V gles wildly to get out of the vise.

This writer has seen norse and

A man go down together under the

powerful drive of the bull. Once
when this happened the picador’s
left leg was caught between
horse and “barrera.” ‘Another
time the bull got his sharp horns
above the horse’s padding and
tore its ﬂank, so that it had to
be led from the arena.

Higlf"$pot -

The. high spot -of “1a corrida,”‘

seen in Pitt’s West Virginia foot-
ball game, is the “suerte de ma-
tar,” or, the kill. The matador
walks into the "ring and standing
in front of the president’s box

dramatically asks -permission, to ‘I

kill his opponent.
, He drops his black -hat and
taking his red “muleta”. and
sword begins a sequence of
thrusts and cape passes keying-
the excited “aﬁcionados,” fans,
for the ﬁnal lunge. .
When this occurs, the “torero,”
seeing the bull’s head -lowered,
stands motionless, taking good
aim. If he is‘ lucky, artistic and

brilliant, holding the muleta in ‘a
his left hand and passing over ‘

Dear Sir:

What happened to the Panther
who used’ to liven up all the foot-
ball -games?!?! Is he on paternal
lave or did he graduate?

If they can collect money for
other campus activities, why
can’t they take up a collection to
buy the Panther a new suit?

Many of the Pittites have been
heard complaining because there
was no Panther to brighten up

ed the beast expertly with one:

thrown to him from an admiring?’

leather wine -sack was thrown
into the arena.

presented him with one of r_,the‘..»,
bull’s ears. Jamie took the sou\"
venir and bit off a piece of the:
ear with a grin. Admirers hur
ried into the arena and carried
the triumphant “torero” away on\_f
their shoulders, acclaiming him
“Mr. Bullﬁghter of Spain.” _

One little boy maneuvered [an._

for a better-tasting cigarette when all you have. to do is
light up a Lucky? Luckies taste better, ﬁrst, because
Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. Then, that tobacco is
TOASTED to taste better. So light up a Lucky. It’s the’
