BOSTON“ — Through the First 39 minutes

of Pitt’s matchup with Xavier on Thursday_

night, it looked like Pitt coach Jamie Dixon was

going to hear the chatter for one more year. ‘
It looked -like Dixon, who’s turned Pitt into

one of the most successful Big East programs

duringhis'six years as head coach, would haye
to hear about how his team can’t Win the ‘big
game to make it past the Sweet 16. It looked
like Pitt might have to wait another year to erase
the stigma that’s been written across Dixorfs

resume 4 whether it was written fairly or not.

Shot” as his teammates call him,‘ came through
with’ the eraser, shooting Pitt to a 60-55 
and its first Elite Eight appearance since 1974.

That year, there were only 25 teams in the
Tournament.

 Former white supremacist, .

neo-Nazi teaches tolerance.

Staﬂ Writer

A reformed neo—Nazi said that the
military taught him more than just how to
fight._ i

said T] Leyden, saying that it gave him the
ﬁghting skills and discipline in a talk called

join the white supremacist movement. He
targeted middle and high schools, the same
age group that is targeted with racist comic
books and video games such as “Ethnic
Cleansing” and “Man Hunt.” ‘
' ‘Not all racists are rednecks in pickups
and baseball bats,” he said. “Most are the
opposite: educated men with ideas.” I

Leyden decided to leave the white su-
premacist movement when his 3-year-old
son used a racial slur.

Leyden spoke of his

Redistricting could sway elections

GOP, page 2,

event sponsored by the College
Republicans in Alumni Hall on
Thursday evening.

Referring to a legal philoso-
phy that emphasizes applying the
law directly to a specific case,
Melvin called herself “a strict
Constructionist.”

Constructionist theory is in
opposition to what is considered

to be more liberal philosophy of -

judicial activism, which offers a
loose interpretation of legal doc-
uments such as the Constitution.

“With just a stroke of the pen,
they will undo all of the reform
the Republicans in Congress have
suggested,” said Melvin of judi-
cial activists.

Orie emphasized the values of
Republicanism.

“Less government, less taxes

and more personal freedoms —
these are the principles of the Re-
publican Party, and these should
remain the principles of the Re-
publican Party,” said Orie.

Orie cited the movement of

‘Vin and Orie

the party away from these prin-
ciples as the primary reason that
the Republicans have been losing
local elections in the recent years.
In spite of this fact, Orie was
quick to note that the Pennsylva-
nia Senate Republicans gained a
seat in the most recent election.

Orie outlined her policy ob-
jectives for the current term, cit-
ing ethics reform as one of her
primary objectives.

“I truly believe we’re at a. tre-
mendous crossroads in this state

to see reform in accountability in .

Orie also

“The Repub-

licans have not

she said.

process, even at
a young age.

“There have
been more legislators elected in
the past two years who are right
out of college than ever before,”
said Orie. “There is a very strong
appetite by the public for fresh
blood in Congress.”

Jane 9 , citizens cast

' their ballots.
 “There is no
greater individ-
ual than [Gov.

Ed Rendell] who wants to see
the Republicans ousted from the
House, ousted from the Senate,”
said Orie.

Melvin has had a colored ex-
perience in the Pennsylvania ju-

diciary. Beginning her career as
the first female Republican mag-
istrate for the City of Pittsburgh,
she left the position to serve on
the Allegheny Court of Common
Pleas until she was elected to the
Pennsylvania Superior Court in
1997.

Both Melvin and Orie attend-
ed law school at Duquesne Uni-
versity and were born and raised
in Pittsburgh.

Zack ‘Bombatch, president
of the College Republicans, was
excited about Orie and Melvin’s
speaking engagement. ‘ “

“We were just looking for
speakers to inspire the Republi-
cans,” he said.

Bombatch expressed disap-
pointment at the small crowd,
though he felt as though the
members of the College Republi-
cans who were present found the
experience rewarding.

“I feel like this event has really
energized the ‘core members of
our group,” said Bombatch.

In response to a question about
renting vs. buying an apartment or

backed at his young self, just out of
Hofstra University, and said that rent-
ing for a few years after college has a lot

The Gaslight Anthem ignites the stage

by Justin Jacobs
A 0’ E Editor

The Gaslight Anthem

\X/ith Heartless Bastards and Good
Old War
Sunday, 8 p.m.
Mr. Smal|'s Millvale
412-821-4447

There are good bands, and then
there are bands with music so good
they become the standard of a genre

The Hold Steady have done just
that for barroom rock, The Roots
have done it for live hip-hop. And
more. recently, punk rock got its con-
temporary standard in the form of
New Jersey-ites The Gaslight An-
them

Theband,madeupof singerBiian
Fallon, guitarist Alex Rosamilia, bass-
ist Alex Levine and drummer Benny
Horowitz, make music that is a syn-
thesis of two of New Jerseys finest
exports — the epic, storytelling, every-
man rock of Bruce Springsteen ﬁised
sonically with the fast, ﬁst-pumping

‘punk of the Bouncing Souls. And

with last years The 59 Sound picking
up steam, a cross—country headlining
tour about to launch and spots on
magazine covers and TV shows piling

up, The Gaslight Anthem is about to
ignite.

Rosamilia, on his last day oﬂf be-
fore  the road, called The Pitt
News to talk rock, Jersey and medita-

U011.

TPN: You’ve had a pretty incredible

 

and quick rise to rock fame.
AR: It’s weird It’s a constant barrage
of surreal moments and pinching
myself. I don’t believe this is actually
plii I .
n ews _The exc uslve

' ‘ show opener
Heartless
Bastards
is on

pi’r’rnews.com

 because everyone told me
it was too impossible for someone like

me We just got back from Europe
and most of the shows were sold out
To go to places I’ve never been before
and have people stoked to see us, that
was incredible

TPN: How’d the band come together

originally?

AR: Brian and Alex were playing to-
gether in a band and drafted Benny.
The previous guitarist wanted to go
back to school, and Benny asked if I
wanted to join, but I was cautious at
first—I’dgivenup the dream at that
point. I was OK with being assistant
manager at a sneaker store I made
enough money to do whatever But
he twisted my arm enough to do it.
TPN: A lot’s been made of the band
being from NewJetsey. Do you feel a
particular connection toJe1sey bands?
AR: I wouldn’t say there’s a speciﬁc
Jersey sound or a Jersey genre. But
even though  sounds differ-
ent, there’sa similar sense of despera-
tion There’s a hint of daustrophobia
because of how easyit is to get stuck
in NewJersey. So it’s not a genre, but a
state of mind.

TPN: Gaslight’s music has a time-
less  Is that where the 59 Sound
concept comes from?

AR: The whole idea behind the re-
cord was that we’d found out that we
all liked soul music We  tried
tomakeanhomagetoanearliertime
We’re  for that sound on pur-
pose -— the Stax sound, the Motown

Fallout 3: The Pitt

Bethesda SOft\NOl‘l<S
Expansion pack available for
download on Xbox Live or Windows

Can’t Pittsburgh get a break ﬁorn
zombie attacks? It’s enough that the
city has to handle its “Dawn of the
Dead” legacy, but now it must face
apocalyptic mutants. Poor Pittsburgh.

This ﬁne citywill act as the setting
for a new add-on to the popular video
game “Fallout 3” created by Bethesda
Softworks.

Except don’t search for an exact
replica of Pittsburgh. “Fallout 3”
takes place in an alternate reality full
of atornicwastelands and mutants
Jeff Gardiner, the lead producer of

the “Fallout 3” downloadable content
packs, including ‘The Pitt,” explained
this future '

“Imagine that the technologi-
cal vision of the 1950s became real.
Cars powered with small nuclear gen-
erators, ray guns, robot butlers Fast-
forward to the year 2077, a nuclear
holocaust occurs. The entire world
is plunged into an anarchistic abyss,”
said Gardiner

“Fallout 3” begins 200 years af-
ter the bombs drop. The survivors
regroup, but not everyone is on the
same side. .

“Some hunt for ancient technol-
ogy. Others try to reestablish a fascist
vision of America. Others huddle
together, just  to stay alive,” said
Gardiner.

Video gamers who survive will fall into ‘The Pitt’

Pittsburgh, the lucky city it is,
avoids the bombs but still deals with
radioactive fallout A group of survi-
vors  themselves Raiders take
over the city and restart the steel mills
by using human slaves

“'The Pitt’ is a deep, rnulti-facet-
ed quest line with a branching story
based upon players’ decisions The
player can interact with the world in
many ways other than through shoot-
ing and throwing grenades. You can
make decisions on whether to help
people, hurt them or leave them to
their fate,” said Gardiner.

Throughout the game, the player
has to make tough moral decisions,
and not just whether to blow up a
mutant with a rocket launcher or a
grenade. One of the imperative com-

ponents of “The Pitt,” though, is that the player
proves himself in a  pit controlled by the
Raiders But when players aren’t ﬂailing in a pit

_full of vicious mutants, you can always go and

sight—see the rest of “Fallout 3” Pittsburgh.

Erik Caponi is a designer for “Fallout 3” and
helped developthe landscape of an apocalypse-
ravaged Pittsburgh.

“One  that was particularly important to

me was that we nail the skyline. Pittsburgh has a
‘very distinct downtown vista, and even people
who havenever visited the city can recognize it,”
said Caponi.

As much as Caponi would have loved to
copy every detail of the ’Burgh, the “Fallout 3”
world is still different than today. For example,
in the timeline of the game, Pittsburgh’s steel in-
dustry never imploded, and so the steel mill.s are
thriving closer to Downtown. . _ A S

“We wanted to have the general architecture
of Downtown be  but avoid  it be

V a specific recognizable location in order to rein-

force the idea that this is a settled island  a dan-
gerous urban ocean,” said Caponi. “To people

. who know the city, it should be both  and

strange at the‘ same time”

To create the ‘game’s version of Pittsburgh,
Bethesda sent its staff to Pittsburgh to photo—'
graph buildings and landmarks used in the game
Then, the designers built a mesh — a three-
dimensional wire frame — and refined it with
texture,  and reflections Then the object

It’s fun to imagine the Universitys campus
as a creepy decrepit mutant lair.  hun-
gry inside—out monsters  through Pos-
var Hall or Hillman library creates a 
mixture of awesomeness and terror. Butcould
Bethesda ignore the Cathedral of  one
of the most   on campus?

_“We had talked about  the Cathedral of
Learning as a location at several points in devel-
opment I _don’t want to get too speciﬁc, but Pitt

‘students, might find that Ashufs ‘Palace’ looks

familiar,”said Caponi. .

Hopefully the Cathedral  get “what it.de—
sérves in “The .Pitt’_’ Before the soot and grime
was cleaned of the Cathedral in 2007, the build-
ing already looked as if it was the victim of
nuclear holocaust It would fit right into a post-
apocalyptic Pittsburgh -

hopeto

by Jasmine Hawkins
Staﬁ’ W/riter

The Pitt women’s basketball
team will face No. 1-seeded Okla-
homa on the Sooners‘ home court
in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA
Tournament Sunday night. In ad-
dition to .coming in ‘as the under-
dog, Pitt has a few more obstacles
it would like to overcome.

For the Panthers, goal No. 1 is
making it past the third round.

“\We were here last year, and‘

now we’d like to go further,” said

Panthers coach Agnus Berenato.‘

“Our goal is to get past the Sweet
16.”

,- Since coming to Pitt in 2002,
Berenato has habitually pushed

if the Panthers further than the exa

pectations of the previous year.

This season, Pitt finished third
in the Big East and acquired its
highest Tournament se_ed ever.
But tournament-placement is not
the Panthers’ final goal.

“Early in the year we set a goal
of making it to the Sweet 16,”

said sophomore center Chelsea .

in the city'does elicit a passionate
response.

Although Morgan is from Philly,
her family is from Pittsburgh, thus
the Steelers have always been her
second favorite team after the Dal-
las Cowboys. In regard to coming to
Pitt, she said, “Living in Pittsburgh
and seeing the intensity of the fans
has deﬁnitely fueled my passion to
celebrate” _ V

Similarly, Kerr was also born into
a family of avid Steelers fans and he
admits that his enthusiasm for the
black—and-gold team has increased
since coming to Pitt.

“The Steelers are huge in the city,
it was nice  here during‘ the Su-
per Bowl,” said Kerr. “I don’t think
the riotwillbe as bigif Pittwins the
national championship, but the cam-
pus will deﬁnitely go crazy.”

No matter which team a student
supports, respect for the Steelers’ ac-
complishments is undeniable.

“Growing up in Ohio, I’m a
pretty strident Cleveland Browns

fan,” said senior Joel Coggins. “Be-

ing in Pittsburgh, it was exciting to
see the team succeed”

On a scale of one to 10, Coggins
stated that his support for the Steel-
ers is a ﬁve. ‘

When it comes to Pitt, Coggins
differs depending on the sport.

“I’m an Ohio State Buckeyes fan
when it comes to college football,
but rooting for Pitt’s basketball team
has been easy because they’re so“.
good and fun to watch,” said Cog-
gins. “There’s no other team I would
root for over Pitt in the NCAA tour-
ney.” _

Sharing Coggins sentiments,
senior Caroline Nilsen conﬁrmed
Lowery’s assertion that the one 
that brings the campus together is
Pitt basketball.

“On campus everyone is a Pitt
fan,” said Nilsen. “Freshman year I
went to the Providence game, and-
the newspapers and booing created
a great sense of community. I’m a
bigger Pitt fan than Steelers fan, be-
cause I have some stake in the Uni-
versity.”

Berenato has good reason not to focus
solely on Paris, because other teams have
suffered by doing so.

Georgia Tech did a commendable job
of containing Paris and her sister, Ashley,
in the second round of the Tournament.
