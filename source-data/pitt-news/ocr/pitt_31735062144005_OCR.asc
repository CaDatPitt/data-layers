A hard-working self-made businessman once told us, “Re-
member, no one really gains when everybody gets a raise.”
Although he probably didn’t realize it, that statement eﬂectively

. brings out the emphasis which we here in America have always

placed on individual achievements and progress. Since itiis
the vast conglomeration of individual efforts and successes that
bring about group advancement, the key to any national or
group accomplishments seems to lie solely in the intrinsic worth
of its various individuals.

Our leaders of higher education have always realized this
basic truth, and, consequently, that is why American colleges
and universities have always tried to treat the individual for
what he is——-the basically important factor in human progress.
Here at Pitt, a similar stress is placed on individual advance-
ment, as exempliﬁed by such things as the choosing of the ‘senior
queen, the annual ODK award, and many others. ' ' ‘

Americans must realize that when the time comes that Am-
erican individuals are no longer able to stand on their own
feet and regard the future as theirs for the taking, there will

i be no further hope for any individual, any group, or for the na-

tion. Today, we see, on one side, our educators trying to build
up individualism, and, on the other side, unionism trying to tear
it down. Union members are deliberately ttold just how fast they
may work and just how —much work they may complete in a
given time. It seems that ambitious individuals have no place in
that scheme of things. From this viewpoint, labor unions and
the Army have something in common in that they both do the
individual’s thinking for him. This system is a necessity in the
Army and in the union too—-if union leaders are to continue in
their lucrative positions of power made possible by hard-earned
money contributed by the individual members in the/' form of
dues..

This stiﬂing of individualism shows itself also in those long
protracted strikes where men are kept out on strike by union
leaders although they must know that even if they gain a raise
in pay, that raise will and must be in effect a very very long
time before they have even regained the pay the strike has cost
them——-not to mention the loss in the actual production of goods
which must remain a lossforever. Individualism means the
right every man possesses, in a democracy, to plan and shape
his own future progress in accordance with his own ability and
with respect for the rights of others. It has been our secret of
success in the past, and it must continue to be our watchword
for the future.

Once again Tap day gave recognition to distinguished stu-
dents in activities today. Performing the traditional rituals,
the University honored students who have maintained outstand-
ing scholastic ability, and have rendered their services on
campus willingly. Lowell Lubic was chairman for this year’s
ceremony at the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial hall.

The dipping of the spoon ritual has been a tradition at the
University for 74 years. Junior classes were honored by senior
classes by receiving the historic wooden spoon for safekeeping,
which is a symbol of achievement. The senior class honored 12
junior men and women for their outstanding contributions to
the University and to their class through scholarship, person-
ality, and work in student activities. Each of the 12 juniors
receive a silver replica of the spoon as evidence -of the seniors
conﬁdence and pride in their achievements. l

The ﬁnal ceremonial "ritual was the announcing of Senior
Queen. The Senior Queen is a symbol, not only rewarded to
one girl by her class for her personal contributions and achieve-
ments, but also for the attainments of the senior class as well.
It IS an expression of the senior class as’ to just what a graduate
of the University should be.

A Many additional students were honored by the various other
honoraries on the campus for their qualities of personality and
character, fortheir success in academic studies and extracur-
ricular activities, and for their contributions to the life of the

Well, men’s elections are over,
aren’t they? Must be —— all the
candidates have stopped smiling.
‘That’s natural, the winners don’t
have to and the losers don’t feel
like it. Now that the campus pol-
iticians have stopped kissing ba-
bies the babes will get a little
more attention. There wasn’t much
mud slinging but that’s probably
due to the shortage——or are they
using it for abode huts for vet-
erans?

In the absence of mud, both fac-—
ti-ons were hard put for slinging
material but substitutes were
available and used. One thing
about the whole situation stood
out like MacArthur’s chin in one
of his more picturesque moods.
That was the lack of uniformity in
the campaign procedures. In case
the election is still somewhat of
a mystery to any of you, let’s say
there were two rival factions.
That’s not necessarily a revalation

but more of an explanation. At
any rate, the election suggested
a crying need for accurate and un-
biased. information about the can-
didates. In the recent election vot-
ers were plagued by a lack of in-
formation on one slate and misin-

Dr. Robert P. Fischelis, na-

dressed the freshman class of the

on the subject “Pharmacy in the

There’s an association at Pitt
that includes every woman on
campus. There is a place in the
Women’s Self Government Asso-

ciation for everyone. As a form of
student government it is unique
for it makes no rules for the life
of women students; it lays down
no regulations to control individ-
ual or group social life on campus.
It functions according to the idea
that women at Pitt are interested
in working together not only for
their own beneﬁt but also for the
beneﬁt of the school.

To coordinate the organized ac-
tivities of women into are unified
whole has become the overall pur-
pose of the Women’s Self Govern-
ment Association. More than one
hundred students are placed each
year on certain of its standing
committees, which take care of
some of the most important ac-
tivities in a woman student’s life
at Pitt. There are committees such

« as -the housing committee, ‘em-

ployment, transfer, which helps
transfer students to acquaint them-
selves with life at the Universi't_y'.

This semester the women of Pitt
rallied under the leadership of
WSGA and promoted an out-
standing ,proje»ct——the Nixon_bene-
ﬁt program which includedwevery

woman on campus. According_to'

Anne Pascasio, this year’s presi-
dent of WSGA, “the women at

school produced a howling suc-

cess.” The ibeneﬁt netted a $4100
to $4200 proﬁt for the completion
of the twelfth ﬂoor. Anne said
that in the future plans of WSGA
the ﬁnishing of the twelfth -[ﬂoor
looms very large. As Anne thought
the*whole situation over she’d“e--
cided that “The women, at'_Pitt

have turned out pretty ‘doggone_

swell.”

E.A.Batcheld-er

The Army ‘Commendation Rib-
gbon has been awarded to Captain
Endicott A. Batchelder, who re-

cently returned to the University

The award was given to Mr.
Batchelder, who is still on terminal
leave, for “making a major con-
tribution to the success of his or-
ganization while serving as pur-

chasing and contracting officer of ’

the United States Armed Forces‘
Institute.” «

Mr. Batchelder, who became as-
.}:;sistant registrar -at Pittlupon his
graduation in 1930, served 18
jmonths with the Anti-Aircraft

two years with the Armed. Service
Institute at Madison, Wisconsin.

While with the Armed Forces
‘Institute, called the “-Fox Hole
‘University’’, Mr. Batchelder Wrote‘
many of the contracts between the

universities conducting correspon-
dence courses for service men. 

A letter to Mr. Batchelder from

ficiency in which you have ap-
proached your assignment has
been an inspiration to representa-
tives of civilian organization co-

Speaker Tells
UNESCO Plan

‘ A good neighbor policy carried
on by the peoples rather than the
governments of the world can
bring about a new era of the
common man, according to Dr.
Ben M. Cherrington, who spoke
to students,‘ Monday morning, in
Stephen Foster auditorium. Dr.
Cherrington, a special consultant
for the Department of State, is the
US representative to the United
Nations Education, Scientiﬁc, and
Cultural organization. He was also
Chancellor-elect of the University
of Denver.

In explaining UNESCO, Dr.
Cherrington said that as a peo-
ple’s movement, “it can be as
broad as the peoples of the world
want it to be.” He envisioned
UNESCO bringing together world-
specialists for conferences on can-
cer, parents and teachers in a
worldwide PTA, students, labor

leaders, and businessmen in glob-‘
al meetings. Dr. Cherrington pre-
faced his talk with a survey of-

the world today.

Inaugurated At Pitt

The response to last week’s writing forum, the official inaugura-

“I seldom have been at a confer-

The enthusiastic response to the
conference was surprising, accord-
ing to Mr. Peterson. “I do think

we learned something by this con-

ference. It was a lot more popular
than we thought it would be.
Next year’s conference will be a

much larger one. Since we will
make use of Foster memorial next
year, more people will be able to
attend,” he concluded.

Participants in the forum were:

effort to ascertain whether or not
it.s taste was as good as its ap-

proceeded to do a little tapping.

His ardor was such that his tap-
ping became too vigorous and

This job of interviewing has its9

good points, too, especially when
your editor gives you a picture of
a cute young lad-y and says, “This
girl’s name is Mary Balinski. She’s
a welder. Get a story.”

When Mary arrives, you take
your mind oﬁ your work long
enough to notice she has red hair,
is about ﬁve feet three, and has,
well, “Personality”. Looking at
Miss B. in her gold dress and
brown trimmings you hardly be-

lieve your editor’s statement that
she’s a welder, but Mary tells you
that for nearly three years she has
worked at the Jones & Laughlin
Steel corporation from four
o’clock to midnight six days a
week. As if that isn’t enough, she
carried a full schedule at Pitt.

Figuring your next question is
a useless one because Mary
wouldn’t have time, you ask, “Do
you have any hobbies or outside
activities”?

“Well”, she says, rather bash-
fully, “I do like athletics. I get a
little swimming, bowling, basket-
ball, track, and volley ball.”

“Oh! Don’t like checkers?”, you
answer, but Mary isn’t at all ﬂus-
tered by your sarcasm. She says
she doesn’t see why a girl can’t
go in for athletics a little without
people getting so amazed. But de-

her how she (lees it.

“It’s simple. There isn’t mu-ch

“How about sleeping?” Did you
give that up as non—essential”?

“No, I only live a few minutes
walk from work so I can get about
seven hours sleep and still make
my ﬁrst class.”

Since you can’t win this argu-
ment on how Mary -ﬁnds the time,
you turn again to sports and dis-
cover that she is chairman of the

tees. She does some coaching for
that organization too. This sum-

“The biggest and best stadium

That’s the declaration of A1 Roth

this affair, as they busily put the

. ﬁnishing touches to the galaxy of

entertainment to be presented at
Pitt stadium on Friday afternoon.

Festivities will commence at 2
o’clock when the ﬁeld will be
thrown open for a public review
of the ﬂoats to be displayed by
the various women’s fraternities on
campus. Immediately following
this, the crowd will move into

noon of entertainment.

At 2:30 o’clock the Women’s

Tomorrow

The Panther nine will attempt
to extend their winning streak at
home to three in a row when they
tangle with Penn State’s Nittany
Lions tomorrow afternoon at the
Stadium. The contest is slated to
get under way at 2 o'clock.

Victorious over Juniata and
Salem in their only two previous
starts at the Stadium, the Pan-
thers will meet a strong State out-
ﬁt which has lost only one game
thus far. The Panther record, not
including Wednesday’s game with
Navy at Annapolis, stands at two
one and one lost.

(The results of the Pitt-Navy
game must be omitted from the
special Tap Day edition of the Pitt
News because of the News dead-
line which was Tuesday of this
week).

The Lions are headed by hard-

Five Panther hurlers have seen
action in the ﬁrst three games
played, with Sam David and Jim
Kline turning in ﬁne perform-
ances. Johnson, Calder, and Rich-
ards have also pitched satisfacor-
ily. It is from this quintet that
Coach Mitterling will select his
starting moundsman for tomor-
row’s game.

On May 1 Sammy David, mak-
ing his ﬁrst start of the year
against Sale mat the Stadium, held

~~~the Tigers to three hits as his

teammates walked off with a 6 to
3 win. The Bridgeville ﬂash walk-
ed ﬁve and struck out seven.

The Panthers batted around in
the last of the second when they
scored three runs. Barnes started
the inning by singling sharply to
right; and he immediately stole
second. Marsiglio bounced out,
Helmick to Whaley, with Barnes
moving to third. He scored on a
wild pitch.

Smodic singled to right and took
second when Male allowed the ball
to go through him. O’Rourke
struck out and Schweinbraten was
hit by a pitched ball. ‘
David reached ﬁrst when Demoss
threw away his grounder, with
Smodic scoring and Schweinbra-
ten going all the way to third on
the play. ‘Gennock doubled to cen-
ter scoring Schweinbraten and
sending David to third. Connolly
walked to ﬁll the bases, but Ku-
zio, the ninth hitter of the inning,
was the third out on a ground ball

to Demoss.

The Tigers took advantage of a
hit, an error, two walks, a pass-
ed ball, and a wild pitch to knot
the count in the third, but the
Panthers came back with two in
the fourth and a run in the eighth
to clinch the game. .

Thinclads At Army Sat.

By. Al Roth

Up on the stadium track, Coach Carl Olson is known as King Carl, but the ﬁery Panther leader
would gladly swap his dynasty for a brace of good ﬁeldmen as his athletes warmup for their coming
triangular meet with Army and NYU this Saturday.

The Pittmen aren’t holding too much hope of bringing home a decision from West Point but em-
phasis is being placed oncertain individual events in which the Blue and Gold can hold their own.
Whatever the results, the locals will receive their best workout of the season in taking off against the
Middies and Violets, ’ranked one and two in the East. '

The Olson trainees took a so-¢_

journ into the hills of Mt. Nittany
last weekend, and bestowed a
grand performance of track hoof-
ing upon the host and the visit-
ing foreman from the University
of Maryland, but despite seven
ﬁrsts in the race events, the Pitt
squad emerged second best. The
ﬁnal tally showed State with
65, Pitt 591/2, and Maryland 491/2.

The Panther excellence in the
track events began with very ﬁrst
affair of the afternoon when Ed
Sudzina, driving against the cold
spring rain, reeled off a 4234.8 mile
to present the ﬁrst ﬁve points to
his teammates. The Duquesne Pa.
lad was never headed as he loaf-
through the ﬁnal quarter on a
fairly fast mile.

The redoubtable Herb Douglas
rounded off the afternoon’s fes-
tivities with a total of 15 points
brought about by a triangle vic-
tory in the 100, 200», and broad
jump.

Douglas performed a 10 second
ﬂat 100-yard, dash with Tommy
Carr swooping in for a third.
Douglas again topped the ﬁeld in
the 220-yd. sprint when he click-_
ed the watch at 23.1 sec., well
ahead of Bob Kritzer, State dash
ace, his nearest rival. In his ter-
minal effort, the winged-footed
Douglas 1-eaped 22 ft. 7%/4 inches to
cop the broad iump.

Clarence Doak scored his usual
double in the 220 low hurdles and
the 440-yd. run. Doak manufac-
tured a 26.6 time with Mt. Leb-
anon Tommy Carr ﬁnishing be-
hind him after a grand, ﬁnal 20
yard spurt.

Doak produced a magniﬁcent

Frat Sweepstakes
In Stadium Today

The long term controversy overe
the IF football championship ﬁn-
ally came to an end as the PiKa’s
defeated the Phi Delts 6 to 2. The
margin of victory lay in the PiKa’s
superior blocking. The game pro-
gressed slowly until the second
half when Amos took the open-
ing kickoff, followed his interfer-
ence beautifully and scored with-
out a Phi Delt getting near him.
The remainder of the game was
purely defensive play. With four
seconds remaining, John Woods
ran behind his goal line to give
the Phi Delts an automatic saf-
ety and two points.

Netmen 
Beat Tech J
In Opener

The Pitt Panther netmen had
little trouble winning their opener
from Carnegie Tech on the Trees
courts, May 1. The ﬁnal score was
8-1. The only loss Pitt suffered
was Jack Child’s victory over Jack
O’Brien, 7-5, 6-3.

Pitt won the ﬁrst four singles

events with apparent ease. Jack
Southworth, Paul Steele, Bobby
Bald, and Chuck Roberts are def-
initely going to be hard to beat
if their play in the opener offers
any indication. Art Harmuth
started cold and lost his ﬁrst set,
9-11, but came back strong, and
in the ﬁnal set defeated his man,
6-0. With more experience he
should be a deﬁnite asset to the
team.

Steele and Roberts paired for
the ﬁrst doubles entry and looked
as much at home together as they
did in the singles. The same goes
for Jack Southworthﬁand Bobby
Bald. Jack Clinton and Harry Gel-
lespie appeared to be the weakest
of the three Pitt doubles entries,
but they played well enough to
cop the last match on the card.‘

The scores of the Pitt-Tech
match are as follows; Jack South-
worth, Pitt, defeated_Jack Meyers,
Tech, 6-2 6-3; Paul Steele, Pitt,
defeated J-oe Harmuth, Tech, 6-2,
6-2; Bobby Bald, Pitt, defeated Al
Selke, Tech 6-4, 6-4;’ Chuck Rob-
erts, Pitt, defeated Dick Heck-
man, Tech, 6-1, 6-3; Art Harmuth,

muth and Dick DePrima, Tech,

TI-IE PITT NEWS

Friday. May 10, 1946

Larry Bondy

 

Sports Editor

Last Thursday’s intra-squad grid game climaxed the Par1th€I"S
spring drills for 1946. Wes was satisﬁed with the results but he
admits that when the nexta-regular season rolls around a much
smoother aggregation will be out there.

‘ Pitt is deﬁnitely lacking reserve material. The ﬁrst string line
is good and as strong as any Pitt line in the past ﬁve years, but re-
placements are very weak.

Looking over the six weeks of practice——the result brieﬂy is-—
the boys havelearned to hit hard and blocking and tackling have im-
proved immensely.

Happened Once In A Lifetime

Winning seven ﬁrst places and still not winning the track meet
is something.-= that happened to Pitt on Saturday afternoon. Looking
back to 1940 the records show where the Olsonmen won an IC4A
championship without taking a ﬁrst place. The meet was held in
Boston with the best teams in the United States entered. That year
California was the Western Paciﬁc track champ but came out second
best to the Panthers.

Pitt still holds. the title as being the only team to win an IC4A
championship without copping a ﬁrst place.

Wrestling Is His ‘Hobby

A fellow--who is doing a swell job in the physical education de-
partment is George Weekes. Weekes is in charge of the intramural
program plus teaching phys ed classes.

‘Weekes: took his undergraduate work at San Francisco State
Teacher’s college. After graduation he worked for the Oakland ‘City
Bureau of Recreation; then entered the Navy.

In the Navy Weekes served as a physical education instructor in
the First Naval District which Carl Olson directed. Weekes was sta-
tioned at Dartmouth and along with his phys ed duties he acted as
wrestling coach. Dartmouth did right well under his tutelage winning
the Eastern. championship.

I At "Pitt Weekes has taught several physical educational majors
the art of wrestling. His one ambition at Pitt is to get an intercol-
legiate wrestling" team organized.

The material is here. It just requires development.

Attend Those Baseball Games

As this paper goes to press the Pitt baseball team is in the midst
of its longest winning streak in the last four years. In fact those two
victories are.-more” games than Ralph Mitterling has won in the past
four years. \

Despite~this record the attendance at the games has been very
poor.‘ The cr‘owds’never goes over the 40 mark. At the Salem game
the crowd was estimated at 25 (excluding the players and umpires).

A Salem fan who sat on the visitors bench yelled up into
the stands,’ “Where are those 10,000 Pitt students? We have more
people at our ‘crap’ games.”

‘ Our chance‘ to show a little team spirit comes tomorrow when
Penn State comes to town.

Kalmanir
Leads Blues
To Victory

With the termination of spring
training, Coach Wesley Feslei
feels conﬁdent—-if not optimistic
—that the team he ﬁelds next fall
will be a good one. He will not
commit himself by saying the boys
will win a goodly number of their
games, but if the spirit they have
shown in practice is present in
their games, the Pitt football team
for the '46 season will be tough to
beat. Most of the fellows are ex-
Gl’s, and many new faces will be
seen in Panther football togs come
autumn.

The ﬁrst two teams consisting
of the Blue ﬁrst team, and White
second team scrinimaged last week
with the Blues coming out on top
36 to 0. The line-ups were: Blue.-I

Left End: Skaldany; Left Tac-
kle: Serrone; Left Guard: Ranii,
Center: Ward; Right Guard: Kosh:
Right Tackle: Harris; Right End:
McPeak; Quarterback: Bruno,
Fullback: Banbury; Left Half.
Kalmanir; Right Half: Zimmovan

The Whites line—up: Left End:

saro; Fullback: Gebel; Right Half:
Conbern; Left Half: Smodic.

The boys alternating in their re-
spective ‘positionsarei End: Mc--
Peak and Mihm; Fullback: Ban-
bury and Gebel; Left Half: Kal-
manir and Smodic; Harris, a fresh-
man, is currently playing the right
tackle slot left vacant by John--
son, who is out for the baseball
team. Johnson expects to be back
nert fall

Kalmanir started for the Blues;
with three touchdown runs. His:
speed and broken-ﬁeld running
left his woul-d—be tacklers trailing’
behind. Skaldany also scored foi
the Blues on a pass from Bruno.
He took the ball on the two yard
line and stepped over for a TD.

Bruno displayed a beautiful bit
of broken-ﬁeld running when he
hauled down a puna and stiff-
armed his way through the entire-
opposition, scampering sixty yards
for another score. Smodic. who
replaced Kalmanir, also showed
his ability to ‘run by high-step-
ping his way for the ﬁnal tally.

Intramural Track Meet 

Next week the Pitt intramural track meet will be run of.
Favored to cop the trophy will be a group of football players
who have combined and formed a team. Such outstanding foot-
ball names as Tom Kalmanir, Jack Smodic, John Kosh, Ed Zim-
movan, B111 McPeak, Denver Newman, and Steve Pollach are

included on the squad.

Ruth Czapiewski and Clare Pa-
puga emerged as the winners of
the WAA badminton tournament
in a game played last Friday with
a score of 15-0. The ﬁnal was set
at one game by the tournament
board. It is also the board’s deci-
sion to declare Czapiewski and Pa-
puga the winners of the whole
tournament even though the los-
ers series is still in progress.

Tennis Continues

Tennis got under way last
Thursday with a rather limited
number of women turning out for
the sport. WAA president, Janice
Meuscke, said that the women
are very fortunate in being able
to use Trees gym courts and that
they should by all rights take
advantage of the situation. “We
want tennis to be the biggest event
of the sports year and we want
Pitt women to support their activ-
ity 100%.”

Tennis was not held this Thurs-
day because of Spring Festival,
but the next practice will be on
Tuesday from 11:30 to 2:00 o’clock.
Girls will again meet in the gym
locker room or go straight up tr
the courts at any time betweer
the hours of playing time.
