General Ridgeway joined Mel-
lon Institute in September, .1955,
after stepping down as Army chief
of, staﬁ. He, has revealed ‘none of
his plans as yet except that he
will reside in Pittsburgh. .
His military career spanned 45
years during ._which time he be-
came distin_.guish_ed by his activity

' in World «War II as an airborne
‘ division'command'er. The General

commanded the Eighth Army in
-Korea, and in I952'was appointed
Supreme Commander _for the Al-
lied Powers in Europe. In 1953,
he became chief-of, staff.

tion to a new fundamental re-
search program, now incorpor-,
ated as part of the Institute’
regular functions. I .

Commpnting on his retirement,
General Ridgeway— said, “Two
months ago I reached the age 65,
the retirement age. That is my

reason for leaving" this post. Al- ,

though I do have some future
plans, they are not complete yet.
‘Therefore, Iﬂwould not be able to
comment ‘on them.”

“Seniors who were interviewed

in the spring are going down town _

to the employment’ ‘offices, where
they have to‘pay a fee, while the

stated. .

Those who‘ found no employ-

for many job opportunities have
been added since then.

. _ _ By HARRIET A. WEHNER . ; 
Pittsburgh Intercollegiate Council is backing ﬁve Pitts-’
burgh schools in attempting, to obtain reduced commu-te’r’s

rates on public transportation.

‘ Phil Williams, chairmanof the Senate," explained-that
PIC feels that these five schools togetherhave a large enough 1;
number of students supporting public transportation, -and/"

and that they should be ableV.to$

At, registration in the fall, stu-
dents attending Carnegie Tech,
Chatham, Duquesne, Mount Mercy
and Pitt will be presented with a
questionnaire. This will include
‘four ‘questions’ of the following
type——By what means do you at-
tend school‘? How muchfdoes it
cost, you? How much .,would you
be willing to pay? Would you be
willing to help in, a program to
obtain reduced rates?

Passes Wanted ' e - _
Williams continued by saying
that a request would be made to
the Pittsburgh Utility Commission
to grant reduced rates to college
students in the form of passes, if

it was felt that a large percentage

ofrstudents commuting were using

public transportation. '

. . If the request was not ful-

l-ﬁlled, the ﬁve schools will un-
dertake an organized boycott.
Car-pools would be set up to-
make sure that all students

‘reached their destination on
-time. Also, it was added, even
if the boycott failed, these or-
ganiaed car-pools, if set. up
eﬁiciently, could reduce ex-
penses for students. , — '

The narrative, which the read~¢
' er will retain in full and in the
right order, is carried forward
.. also by these two questions: first,
~ will Rebeck finally leave the cem-
S etery? and second, will the jury

decide Michael was a suicide and

remove him from his Catholic
‘M grave and from his ghost-lover
‘Laura?  .

Concern with Reality
Fantasy or not, ‘this book has
Qeverything to do with reality.
. Beagle’s cemetery-world is a con-
stricted framework within which
,the problems of life, love, and
death, are manageable.

The framework i; this: ‘the
~ newly dead are ghosts confined
within the cemetery walls, and
they can exist only by forcing‘
themselves into intense con-
’ sciousness of the life they left
behind, only until the process
‘of forgetting finally defeats
. “them. .

,_ One ghost, Michael, says: ‘‘,All
, thesounds we hear are sounds we
furemember.” The other— Laura,
says: “Every beautiful thing you
can remember comes in handy
after death.”
Chess with Ghosts

“sleeping on marble and playing
chess with ghosts.”

Z

Private Place,” by Peter S.

‘Beagle, is a fantasy about _ Yorkchester cemetery, about

{Jonathan Rebeck, who lives there, the raven who brings him
"food, and especially about two ghosts.

" _The basic problem in the book is whether the-two ghosts

in spite of having no bodies.

them until they fade away. We
come to see that this ability of
his is due to the fact that he is,
as he says, “neither man nor

,~ ghost.”

He has, according to the raven,
a “half here and half there” look
about him. But at one point Re-
beck says: “Sometimes I have

.thought that I might be a ghost

myself. Could that be? Could I
have lived here and died and not
know it?”

- Gave up Life

At any rate, he long ago gave
up on life and entered the Lethe
of the cemetery, and like the
ghosts he cannot pass through the
gates back into the world. He is,
as Mrs. Klapper puts it, “a gentle-
man with a screw loose.” ,

And we have a raven, a pro-
fane black bird,” who is very
funny. “Because he was too ar-
rogant to walk, too heavy for
telephone wires, and too un-
popular for bird sanctuaries, an
amazingly large portion of his
life had been spent in the air.”-

His job in life, because he and
Rebeck “both had delusions of
kindness,” is to provide Rebeck
with sandwiches, ‘baloneys, chess
pieces, all stolen from shops
around New York, and he oc-
casionally brings news from head-
lines he reads while flying.

V Raven is Cynical ,

It is significant that the raven
is the main contact with life out-
side the cemetery. The perverse
raven is cynical about life, about

Research Given
Cancer Grant  

Of$20..000
I By TRUDY WEISS
The Universityhas received
‘grants totaling $20,000 from
the American Cancer Society.
“‘The Society’s Institutional
Research Grant to the Uni-
—versity of Pittsburgh Will
enable a number of scientists to

‘i;;g: develop and reﬁne their ideas,”

said Dr. John Lauer, national re-
search representative for the
Pennsylvania Division of '_ the
American Cancer Society. -
Dr. Richard J. Cross, chairman
of the Institutional Research
iGra'nt Committee at the Univers-
ity, deﬁnes this grant as “seed

ial projects are not yet well en-
_ ough formulated to be considered
“I ‘for project grants which support
 'most of the research today. I
~@ ~.,_._ First of Kind
The Institutional ‘ R e s e a r c h
Grant to the University is the ﬁrst
 of-its kind in this area. It is
‘7 roughly one-fifth of the total
1 amount granted to cancer re-
searchers in Allegheny County for
the coming year. ' ‘ -
The granting committee has

‘ this “seed money.” Representa-
tives of the School of Medicine,
the Graduate School of Public
Health, and the Department of
‘Natural Sciences, who comprise
the committee’, feel that this
amount will enable the scientist
"to test his project far enough to

EUROPE ,,MADE

Last week we discussed England, the ﬁrst stop on the tour of
Europe that ‘every American college student is going to make’
this summer. Today we will discuss your next "stop, France-or
the Pearl of the Paciﬁc, as it iagenerally called.

"swims the English Channel. Similarly, to get from France to

As you can see, the most impo1'ta.nt single item to take to Europe

is a valise full of grease.-

No, I am wrong. The‘most important single item to. take to‘
Europe is a valise full of Marlboro Cigarettes. Oh, what a piece
of work is Marlboro! If you think ﬂavor went out when ﬁlters

and yet you, get the full,‘ zestful, edifying taste of the,choice/ cf; 1
tobaccos that precede the ﬁlter. This remarkable feat of cigarette ‘ ' ‘

 

engineering was achieved by Marlboro’s research tcam—Fred

Softpack and Walter’Fliptop<—and I, for one, am gra_teful.

But I digress. We were speaking of France—or the Serpent of
the Nile, as it is popularly termed.

First let us brieﬂy sum up the history of F rance. The nation
was discovered in 1492 by Madame Guillotine. There followed

a series of costly wars with Schleswig-Holstein, the Cleveland

Indians, and Captain Dreyfus.

 

Stability ﬁnally came to this

“ troubled land with the coronation of Marshal Foch, who

married Lorraine Alsace and had

three children: Flopsy, Mopsy, V

and Charlemagne. This laterbecame known as the Pctit Trianon.

Working for individual proﬁt. .

I believe‘ that‘ Food Services V T V, ‘
cuts too many corners in an effort_.to. make’ greater

.. proﬁts. Let’s look atrthe evidence.

' The manager of F.S. said that almost all F.S.
employees at Pitt belong to a union. He failed to
make" any correction when this statement was

' . printed in The Pitt News. 1 ' ~

Theday that particular issue came "out, four’

 employees told. me that this was: untrue. They -

said that none of the workers in the kitqhen, cafe-
teria, ,Venetian Room, or Tuckfshop 4laelong‘»»to any

kind of union. “In fact,” they said, t"q‘union gagitators I
were laid off.” Instead of earning"-'the_high wéfges ,.

the manager intimated, most F.S,"e,m'ployees..work

S‘ for $.80 per hour for their first three months, and

$.90 afterward, if they --stay that ‘long.’ "
. —How can a personrraise a, family and live'~'with
any kind of dignity on $31.00‘or-‘less-.~ per week?

That this is clearly inequitable is proven by -the
.- "

false impression given by Food Service.
Against Universii-y_Po|icy, , , _
The woman who keeps our oHi‘ces"clean (a good
job too) belongs to a union, because‘-Vitfps‘ a Univer-"
sity policy to hire union non-olﬁce workers. Working-
for. the University, she—.gets‘_signiﬁcantly higher
pay than she would for Food Service. ,
- T Food Services clearly pays its employees", the
smallest wages necessaryto get food served. More
important, it has many «irritating and inconviencing
money-saving practices. . _ _' _‘
-‘According to a nine-month—old report, froma
University otllce, “Banquet prices do not appear to
compare favorably with prices at restaurants in
the area. . . .” For example, “. .,,.~,. The ‘Modern

, the ‘Fairfax where they -had a dinner for $2.7,5,_.per

‘Careful Humor’

Beagle handled the whole story
with careful humor, so that even
when very

age. 11' Beagle were a less skill-
ful writer it would appear he is
trying to be funny, and the whole
thing would fall flat, especially

in scenes of parthos:

But Beag'le‘s light touch suc-
ceeds in setting the material
free. As Rebeck says: “If you
don’t take the things‘ you want
to say so seriously you might
get a few of them straight.”

The humor does’ not always
quite succeed, particularly with
the raven, "but the flaws are few
and seem insignificant.

Combines Humor, Pathos_

Beagle has various ways of
combining and juxtoposing humor
and pathos.

He will, for instance, be seri-
ous about _something serious,
and then gives it a quick, final

_ turn. He describes thecemetery
as a. small city, with _streets,'
some parts shabby, some _mag-

. nificent, this section for Italians,
that one for Germans, and con-
cludes that Yorkchester was

“nonsectarian but nervous.”

Another example
young couple comes into the cem-
etery and unwittingly tantalizes
Laura and Michael with their
physical happiness. The situation
gets pretty hot, but the ‘girl frus-
trates the boy, and then she pulls
him to her. “My Harry,” sh e
whispered. “My poor, greedy Har-

V ' Story Witty, Sad

There Aare places
storyis witty and sad at the same
time. For example, Michael is
being buried, and ‘the dirt is fall-
ing on his coffin. “Sandra was
crying loudly‘ and quite thorough-

ginning to sound. like yawns.

They probably got you upvearly
for this too, I'm sorry, lass. Just
a ‘minute or so-—then you can
go home’ and goback to sleep.”
Beagle sometimes creates hu-
mor by understatement. For‘ ex-
ample, Michael was
Sandra had poisoned A_him. “She
‘was’ my wife and she murdered
me,,and my feelings are under-
standably hurt about the whole
thing.” A later statement by him
illustrates the forgetting... process:

fFinel Metaphors’
~Aside from humor, the read-
er will come across many fine
metaphors, and many instances
of sublimely good" writing, such
as the dawn Laura and Michael
spend looking out at Yorkch_ester,
the town: A '
“Alarm clocks were going
off in the city now. One after
another, sometimes two or three
together,‘they drove their small
silver knives into ‘the body of
the great dream that sprawled

al, amiable, and defenseless as
it-would still takeailittle Will]

Beagle has an amazingly sharp
ear for speech, which the reader
will see particularly in Mrs. Klap-
per’s lines. For instance, "Mrs.
Klapper answers Rebeck’s com-
plaint that'he has wasted so much
time, has kept" himself from be-
coining a great man:

   Plan Presented
. To Perk_ Up
 Spring Sports

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

j A quick glance at the Pitt sports" program will bring a
_ grimace to the faces of enthusiastic Panther sport’ followers.
"_lThe’track, baseball, golf and tennis teams are having losing
 seasons. , A _

 .Our local heroes are getting beaten everywhere they
.‘ turn. It’s about time something was done to liven up the
._ llllsports scene. ‘After ponderingfor quite a while I came up
:7~'.*-, .[with a solution, and a brilliant one at that! , '

 A few months ago I advocated the changing of the Syria
,-Q 'Mos_que and Soldiers’ and Sailors’ "Memorial into a basket-
‘ 7 ‘ball auditorium and a ﬁeld house, respectively. Then I sug-
_i gested that the ﬁrst three ﬂoors of the Cathedral be changed
 into a parking lot to solve the parking problem.

Now I am going to top all this. My ingenious plan
to perk up the spring sports program may arouse more
students to support our athletic teams; ’ I
._ Let’s make women’s athletics a major sport! Give out
. '40 or 50 scholarships, turn the stadium over to the girls and
 let them put on our sports attractions. Wouldn’t it be nice
 to see all our lovely coeds walking around the campus with
their varsity jackets proudly on display for the strongersex.
‘(That’s us, I hope.) _ -

. . You ‘say this is impossible? Not by a long shot. All we
need is to get a little supportbehind the program and I bet
 would catch on all over the. country. After all, this is an

.J.’'' P Olympic year and the Russians are favored to win the games '
A mainly on their’ superiority in the women’s events.

, If we make women’s sports a major activity then our
women, wanting to gain attention, will become inter-
ested, start to practice and the result: the United States
women will become far lmore superior to the Russians’

feminine athletes. _ -

Now that we have won the 1964 Olympics let’s get back

to the matter at hand, the spring sports program. You have

to admit that if the girls were to organize sa/y tennis, golf,

softball and swimming teams and begin inter-collegiate coml

petition, it would certainly make the spring sports program
more interesting. Even if they didn’t win a game.

 P So, let’s get behind the women and start some action.

 ' Let’s put the girls in shorts and get them out on the athletic

 ﬁeld. ’

 ‘ I would like to thank the Pirates for this generous cour-

A Traclemen Pull
 For W/fin. Over

Villanova
By JACK SIVIITH

Villanova provides the ﬁnal
dual meet opposition for the
Panther thinclads who are in
quest of a .500 season. Villa-
nova captured the indoor

.4, IC4A Championships this year
In with a sophomore team, so the
odds are against the Panthers'ﬁn-
ishing first Saturday at the Sta-
! dium. . '

The Wildcats, however, are no-
torious for turning in better per-
formances in the championships"

. -than in dual, meet competition.

Last year they were highly fav-

ored over the Panthers, yet only
. won 68-63 in a high controversial
 meet.‘The mile relay, which the
V ; ,3-Panthers thought they had won
,  fbute were disqualiﬁed for cutting

 ,i_n, decided the meet.

M Cats Hold Own

With runners like Frank Budd,

    

Bob Raemore and Paul Draton'

‘Villanova looks’ stronger in the
sprints. But don’t rule out the
= Panthers altogether, for Speedy
‘Mel Barnwell and Jim Donahue
, can hold their own. ,
‘ Lastyear Barnwell walked off_
with the 440-yard honors in

tional Collegiate Sprint Cham-
pion Ew Collymore in the 220,
a nemisis he doesn’t haveto con-
.,tend with this year. Last year
the race was won in 20.6 Barn-
., well placed second to State’s'
. Bob Brown last weekend in 20.8,
- but ran the race. after competing

V In the distance races and in
_ A ‘thevﬁeld events the Panthers seem
3 _- to hold a -substantial» advantage,
an advantage that could keep

 e Should the meet come down to

_the mile relay‘ again this year,
i the Panthers‘ might as well. kiss

their hopes of victory! goodbye. -

.Vi1lanova is running the mile re-

49.2, then placed second to Na- V -

lay in 3:12; the Panthers in 3_:20.

"Coach Carl Rees doesn’t appear to

be optimistic or pessimistic.

_“I‘ know we’re stronger in some
spots, yet weaker in others,” Rees
said. “It should-be closer" than the
Penn State meet, and we could
win it.” At this point it’s safer to

, To most people, an IBM com-
Vputer is a '-“giant brain,” but the
"eighth tloor’s “baby” isn’t‘to be
} referred to in such colloquial lan-
. guage. “The machine actually
 ‘does no creative thinking, but is
directly under the control of man,_”
stated Kopas.

‘—‘But one fallacy of the corn-
puter,” added Bacon, “is that it
thinks it is built in the image of
man. It. doesn’t know that it is
set off-by knobs and buttons con-’
trolled by people." ‘.
 “The thing that impresses

most people about the machine
- is its rapidity in solving-prol»

lems,” said Ranshaw. “It can do’

in ten‘ seconds what it takes man

ten years to do." '

  

  
 
 

 

A. computer are the people ‘in the
V Crystallography Dept. They get
 .patterns and structures of mole-

cules-by running x-rays of the
 crystals. Much time can be saved
ihyhot ‘having to do this by hand.
g .=_ ‘‘-‘Those people ‘involved in theses
 Vprojécts ‘for graduate work also

is espceially true of- engineers,
,'mathematicians, and accountants.
'JIt- is common for the machine to

be in use'24 hours a day.

The main box of the machiine
contains 2,000 numbers. Since
most problems have more than
2,000 words, there are separate
units, called tape machines, which
store the extra knowledge. ’

- “Even non-mathematical prob-
lems can be solved,” Kopas men-
tioned. “Tests and problems may
at first seem non-mathematical,
-but can be solved by association
and symbolism. In scientific
studies, hypotheses are submitted
using symbolism, and the degree
of agreement can be found by
matching X-ray data and the real
thing.” A '

‘ One" particularly impressive
thing was the rate with which
the I.B.M. computed a. sample
problem in addition. It added 21
single number 105,607 times.in
one minute. But this was under
ideal conditions, when nothing
else was in__the machine.

Anyone may go up to the eighth
floor, it’ he has a problem‘ to be
solved by the machine. It'is-open
to all qualiﬁed users, and free to
those connected with the'univers-
ity. Outsiders are charged as much
as $80 dollars perpjhour because
of the high operating expense.
“The freedom of the person using
the machine depends on his com-
petence,” said Bacon.
