‘Pitt Tenure: Publish or Perish? Trans” Aid 35” Keeps  
    9   PAT's Fares Constant l

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

A spirited debate among faculty
members focusing on the relative
weight of teaching and scholarship
in selection of candidates for tenure
was launched at Friday's Univer-

sity Senate meeting. '
The debate came in response to
Senate Council President Frank
Slaughter’s request for faculty
members to “uncover and develop

‘Pin Police Report
in  Weei<'s Crimes

Crimes at Pitt included some 20
thefts this week, distributed over
the campus buildings including
three in I-lillman Library and‘three
in the Cathedral of Learning.

“‘Altogether,” said Campus Po-
lice Chief Kurt Graham, “lt’s been

-#7 " a quiet week. Twenty thefts is just
about average.

“Crimes in the dorms are down
overall," Graham added. “They
used to comprise about 60% of the
crimes, and now they’re around
40%, which is significant.”

Graham said some factors con-
tributing to the decline in crime
within the dorms are student action
and increased police patrols.

According to the Campus Police
incident report for the week of the.
13th, crimes on campus included
three thefts in Pitt’s Student

, Union, an auto theft at the J
" 1 parking lot on DeSoto Street, a
burglary from a car on University
Drive, and an attempted burglary

in the Loeffler Building. -

Also mentioned are several
incidents of student misconduct,
filed as three attempts at misuse of
ID cardsfat T

diverse points, of view” with
respect to the Tenure Commis-
sion’s recommendations for tenure
selection. -
Each speaker was allowed ten
minutes to present views differing
from «those previously expressed by
faculty members or the Tenure
Commission’s Report.'

The Report, published last Febru,-‘

ary by the Senate Council's Tenure
Commission, is the result of long
range investigation and analysis of
Pitt’s tenure system and alterna-
tive tenure systems.

As it stands, the Report states

that the primary characteristics of a

can_didate.to be considered in
making an appointment are those
which indicate his ‘ability to
maintain a career of effective
teaching and signiﬁcant research
or artistic activity.

-CAS Dean Robert Marshall

disagreed with_the Tenure Com-
mission's recommendation that
candidates for tenure be both
effective teachers and distin-
guished members of their own
field. A’ccording~.to Marshall,

research is not a mission all
candidates should ‘be forced to
fulﬁll. A '

“To expect all tenure candidates
to achieve distinction in’ their field
creates a bias against teaching,”
Marshall said. “We’re going
backwards if we’re concentrating
on our own research work while
neglecting the needs of the
students and the University com-
munity.”

Marshall asked for recognition of
variety in meeting students’ needs,
eliminating the strict choice be-
tween only research and teaching
that ‘must be made by tenure
candidates. —

Norman Austern, Professor of
Physics, called for equal consider-
ation of both the teaching and
professional missions, suggesting

that the current over-emphasis on ‘

teaching is a “hangover from the
sixties” when tenure selection was

_thought to be solely dependent on

what a faculty member had
published.

“A serious discussion of tenure is
injured if just counting publications
of tenure candidates is allowed to
remain in the background,”
Aus.tern said, “but we shouldn’t let
our sensitivity to this kind of thing

‘divert us from an appreciation of

the diversity that’s called for in an
institution like this.” ‘
‘Greater emphasis should be
placed on teaching when tenure
decisions are made, according ‘to
Student Government Representa-
tive Bruce Keeler. “It is hard to
evaluate teaching effectiveness and
excellence, but this is no excuse for
underplaying the teaching ‘mis-
sion," he said. “Instead, new
methods of equitable evaluation of
teaching must be developed.”
Keeler went on to say that
education of students is the
primary reason for the establish-
ment of this University and that

Pitt’s bus ’ riders got some
welcome news last week when
Congress gave ﬁnal approval to a
mass-transit aid bill that could put
as much as $53.3 million into
Allegheny County’s transit system
making it possible for PAT to keep

‘bus and trolley fares at the current

level. 1 ~

‘ About 55-65% of Pitt’s approxi-

mately 7,000 commuters use the
bus daily, according to Bob
Heister, president of the Pitt
Commuter Association.

“This new money may mean
eventual reduced fares for Pitt
students, Heister said. “We’ve
been working with the Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG),
another student organization here.
at Pitt, to try to get fares reduced.
PAT has told us that we must get
more money from some outside
agency before they can cut the
fares.” - ' A

Marijuana Legalization

BY RALPH HAURWITZ

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette call-
ed for the legalization of marijuana
in an editorial last Friday, saying
that “the time is ripe for Congress
and the states to abolish laws
that...make part of the population
rebels and the’ rest hypocrites.”

The editorial stated that - laws
against the possession of marijuana
do not promote public health and

safety, and that the best solution is-

The editorial advocated total le-
galization, rather than what it
called “quarter-and half-loaf pro-
posals: ’ ’ selective non-enforcement
of the law, and legalization of
possession, but not the sale.

Present laws in the United States '

prohibit “all marijuana related
behavior,” according to the First
Report of the National Commission
on Marijuana and Drug Abuse.

have taken place in Boston recently

— against black school children and

the "black community. We are
asking for people from all over the
country to come and show support
for the civil rights of blacks.”

Adachi, the Socialist Worker’s
Party candidate for US Senator in
the recent elections, said there is a
move to “build the broadest possi-
ble coalition here in Pittsburgh to
help publicize the march. We are
just beginning to contact political
organizations, labor unions, reli-
gious groups and other people we
feel might support this.”

The March is being organized
nationally by the Emergency Com-
mittee for a National Mobilization
Against Racism, Cambridge MA,
and already has received the formal
support of numerous US leaders,
celebrities, and scholars.

A list of local sponsors for the
March includes NAACP director

ment Board, Pitt Black Action

Ford’s jet arrived at Andrews Air
Force Base, where members of his
family, the Cabinet, congressional
leaders and a small crowd
welcomed him home from his trip
to Japan and South Korea as well
as the meeting with the Russian
leader.

The agreement reached at Vladi-
vostok was verbal. Ford is waiting
for a written Soviet statement
setting forth the exact terms before
making a public announcement of
the numbers of warheads and
launching systems involved.

It was understood both sides
agreed to put their understanding
of the agreement on paper within
week. -

Ford will brief Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders
on the outcome of the summit
Tuesday and meet with other
Congress members later in the
week.

One U 5 official indicated Ford
might reveal the numbers in a
television address within a week.
_Another ofﬁcial said Ford and
Brezhnev found a personal rapport
with each other, with the Soviet
leader “bearhugging the Presi-
dent."

The two “hit it off famously,” he
said. “They are two tough guys
who are fundamentally politicians.

Rep. Udall Tosses Hot
Into '76 Democratic Ring

WASHINGTON AP-

He probably will have plenty of
company before it is over, but at
the moment the only announced
Democratic contender for President
in 1976 is Representative Morris
Udall of Arizona.

Udall, 52, got the jump on several
potential opponents for the nomin-
ation by announcing Saturday he
would enter ‘New Hampshire’s
March 1976 presidential primary,

at 7:30 pm.

The local meeting, according to
Adachi, will concentrate on publi-
cizing the march, organizing bus
transportation to Boston, and plan-
ning a possible local march for
people who are unable to attend the
Boston march.

Adachi said she expects a “fairly
sizable” number of Pittsburghers
to travel to Boston for the National
March.‘ She encouraged students
interested in the march to contact
the Pitt Young Socialist Alliance or
Black Action Society for infor-
mation.

the first in the nation.

The decision followed a six-month
sampling "of sentiment among
Democratic voters that convined
Udall the race is wide open now
that Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts has taken himself
out of it.

Thursday’s announcement by
Senator Walter Mondale, (D-MN),
that he would not run in 1976 also
bolstered Udall's belief that he has
as good a chance as anyone.

Udall was elected to his seventh
House term three weeks ago. He is
well-known to his colleagues on
Capitol Hill‘ but is probably the
least-known nationally of the likely
New Hampshire primary candi-
dates, which is a principal reason
he decided to start running so
early. I

Senators Henry Jackson of Wash-
ington and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
have been taking extensive sound-
ings, including visits to New
Hampshire, and are expected by
most observers to become candi-
dates.

Philosophy Professor Adolf Grun-
baum, warned that Pitt will be no

greater than any community‘

college if it loses sight of its
mission beyond merely teaching
students. In GrImbaum’s view, the
University’s high standards of
quality can be maintained only if its
professors are qualiﬁed in ways
beyond those who teach at
community colleges.

“If the,University of Pittsburgh is
not to become, in large measure, a

‘community college,” he said, “I

see no safeguard against this other
than the demand that there be
some evidence of scholarly work on
the part of any person who is going
to receive tenure.”

Professor of Black Studies Em-
manuel- Anise charged thatthe
discussion of equal balance be-
tween teaching, research and
service to the community is a
sophisticated way of escaping
difficult problems.

“What is actually required is a
speciﬁcation of the degree of
relevance to be placed on each
mission,” Anise said. “Candidates
should be rated separately in

ijeteaching, in research activity, and

community service, because teach-
ing roles differ within different
departments and at different
levels.”

tenure selection in the undergrad-
uate area should emphasize teach-
ing skills, while graduate levels of
education require more of a
research background.

Jonathan Harris, Chairman of the
Pitt Professional Union’s Tenure
Committee, advocated a plan which
allows each individual department
to determine its own criteria for
tenure selection. Each candidate
would be judged, according to
Harris, on the basis of his own
department’s criteria.

“It’s impossible to say what is the
indicator of good teaching or good
research,” Harris said, “but the
only unit capable of deciding on the
mix of skills it needs ‘_ is the
Department.” _

Most importantly, we hope the administration does not attempt to
acify students by taking advantage of the ﬁnals period or the
fstmas vacation to make a decision which ‘under normal
cumstances would be vehemently opposed by black students. This
ainly would only reincite the emotions which have been dormant for
"e last few weeks. ~
 that should not be the goal of the administration.

Politics and Busing

e recent bill passed by the state legislature forbidding the Human
itions Commission from ordering the busing of school children to
at eve racial balance is yet another example of inane legislation
involving our state representatives.
bill is. expected to be vetoed and justiﬁably so by Governor Milton
 upon his return from‘ the People’s Republic of China.
-1 e bill, a compromise between the two houses of the General ‘
I embly, would take state government. out of the busing business,
_‘d' force state courts into mandating busing in school districts
I i_ ughout the state. The result more than likely would be chaotic, in
 local judges rulings would be continually appealed to ‘higher
urts, a process which in itself could take years and indirectly affect
quality of education for many children. i ‘
tate government and its agencies should be entrusted with
moting the letter and the spirit of past US Supreme Court rulings,
” ch mandated quality education for blacks and whites and ‘endorsed
_ mg as a means of obtaining racial balance. The state judiciary
should not be thrust into this issue, since the achievement of racial :
balance in society involves the legislative and executive branches of ,
govenunent, and in Pennsylvania the state legislature is seeking to
absolve itself of the busing controversy. Governor Shapp should not be
empted to follow suit. ~ ’
_few months ago Senator Thorms Nolan of Tlurtle Geek conducted
 c investigation aimed‘ at abolishing the Human Relations
Commission. Many citizens refused to accept such a political move
 on appeasing American middle class fears. Now, it seems there
is. a concerted move to remove all authority from the commission,
" I 'ch«is simply intolerable. V . -
e Human Relations Commission is a non-political body dedicated to
y al justice and; equal treatment for all citizens. They are above the
 ssure tactics of the state legislature and above succumbing to the
ars-‘ of racial backlash. _ j -
l» political ofﬁcials must commit themselves to ridding the nation of
__al injustice and racial prejudice. The Human Relations Commission
has worked well and conscientiously. The agency has demonstrated an
"acute sensitivity to the problems of racial prejudice and social injustice.
ecommission should be allowed to continue its humanitarian work,
 we are convinced the governdr will be responsive to the needs of
Pennsylvania citizens and veto this legislation.

An American Crusade ..

Bobby’s Newer World

BY TOM SMITH

“Our future may lie beyond our
vision, but it is‘ not completely
beyond our control. It is the
shaping impulse of America that
neither fate nor nature not the
irresistable tides of history, but the
work of our own hands, matched to
reason and principle, that will

determine destiny. There is pride .

in that, even arrogance, but there
is also experience and truth. In any
event it is the only way we can
live."

Robert F. Kennedy’s life" mirrored
his words. Had he lived Kennedy
would have been 49 years old last
week. .

With his hands--with his life--he
tried to make Americans realize
they could control their destiny by
laying the foundation on which
future generations could build. His
ideal world was one free of hatred

_, and abundant with opportunity. ,
More than anything this moti- '

vated his ill-fated crusade for the

presidency in 1968. That crusade ’

and the dreams and the hopes for
America voiced along that primary
route ended when Robert Kennedy

died of gunshot wounds in Los 

Angeles six years ago.

Though one man may have pulled
the trigger, his sickness was indi-
cative of the society in which he
lived--a misdirected society seek-
ing for permanent solutions to
problems which seemed to have no
solutions. I

The year 1968 had already been a
year of sorrow, devastation and
chaos. American cities were in
ﬂames. Those who morally ob-
jected to American. involvement in
Southeast Asia cried out to be
heard by their government.

Minnesota Senator Eugene Mci-V’

Carthy responded to the pleas for
change and challenged President
_Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic
nomination. McCarthy's respect-
able showing in the New Hamp-
shire primary shocked both a party"
and a people.

Robert Kennedy announced, his
candidacy for the nomination,
though many criticized him for
entering the race after McCarthy's
victory. Shortly afterward on
March 31, Lyndon Johnson an-

nounced he would not seek the .

presidential nomination again. A
war had ended a career and the
world appeared on the brink of
change. ' , ,

In head to head primary battle
Kennedy defeated McCarthy in
Indiana, Nebraska, and South Da-
kota, but he suffered the family’s
first electoral defeat in the Oregon
primary. -

While campaigning in Indiana the‘

- problems which plagued America

became tragically evident. Martin
Luther King was assassinated in
"Memphis and Kennedy broke the
news to a black ‘audience in
Indianapolis as he said, “We will
have difficult times in the future. It
is not the end of violence. It is not
the end of lawlessness. It is not the
end of disorder."

But, even in that tragic hour

‘ Kennedy voiced his hopes for the

nation. “What we need in the
United States is love and wisdom
and compassion - toward one
another, and a feeling of. justice
toward those who still suffer within
our country, whether they be white
.01. they be black.”

‘ -'__The,scene. shifted to_L_os,Angeles i

as Kennedy added, yet another
primaryewin to his triumphs.

But, in a hotel kitchen hallway, the
lawlessness, thediso/rder, the vio-
lence and the death again struck
and haunted a nation. The terror
which began in the shadows of
victory ended one Saturday night in
Arlington. at a gravesite lit by
candles after a seemingly endless
journey by train from New York
City.

Another dream had vanished and
hope for America had dissipated
once again in the death of a man
who accepted the quixotic chal-
lenge to right the many wrongs of
the country.

Kennedy‘s greatest attribute was '

his ability to inspire a troubled
nation.’ “Only those who dare to
fail greatly can ever achieve
greatly,” he said. By living his life
as he did he passed the torch to
another "generation and demanded
they also dare to achieve--to seek a
newer world. A

In the six years since his ‘death
American society has changed
indeed. We have lived through
Kent State, My Lai, skyrocketing
inflation, the resignation of a

president, and an uncertain econ-

omic future. No wonder a web of
cynicism and fear has entangled
the ‘American people. ‘

No longer do Americans work to
end oppression, poverty, and in-
equality. No longer do the institu-
tions of government or those
serving in government offer hope
or encourage solutions to the
nation’s great social problems,
which have not changed over the
years. And no longer do Ameri-
cans have respect for those institu-
tions.

Kennedy took pride in‘ pointing
out so many times that one man
can change the world. He cited
Martin Luther, Joan of Arc, Chris-
topher Columbus, and Thomas
Jefferson as examples of those who
had “moved the world."

He once said, “Each of us can
workggo change a small portion of
events",andiin.,the total of those acts

will be written the history of this
generation. Each time a man
stands up for» an ideal he sends
forth‘ a tiny ripple of hope, and
those ripples build a current that

' sweeps down the mightiest walls of.

oppression and resistance.”

If Americans can rededicate
themselves to the principles and
the beliefs voiced those six long
years ago, the ideals of Robert F.
Kennedy will be alive, and no’

.. longer will there be a need to

search for the man and his crus/ade.

His words in Indianapolis are
relevant even today. . “Let us
dedicate ourselves to what the

 

Greeks wrote so many years ago: to .’ —

tame the savageness of man and’
make gentle the life of the world.
Let us dedicate ourselves to that
and say a prayei"’for our country
and for our people."

‘ Awesome Band

Performance

Dear Editor,

Slippery Rock State College is a
small state-owned institution of
higher education located approxi-
mately 50 miles north of Pitts-
burgh. I had the opportunity this
past Saturday to visit Slippery Rock

to attend that school’s champion-_p
ship football game: Slippery Rock"

State. The
day was

vs. West Chester
football played that

i--jgitypically of the small-school vari-

ety: passes from the quarterback
were wobbly, the defensive players
were not aggressive, the ﬁeld was a
sea of mud and the stadium only
seated about 15000 persons. If you
want to be impressed do NOT go
there for football. If you want to be
impressed by Slippery Rock, go
there to see the performance which
is put on during the game by the
Slippery Rock band.

The Slippery Rock band is
composed of 120 musical instru-
ments, 10 flag-carriers, 8 major-
ettes and 40 ‘Rockettes.’ [Rock-
ettes are similar to Pitt’s Panther-

~ ettes, except that the Rockettes are

.,..-N
/

" allowed to perform on the field with

the band.] The total performance
put on by these students is indeed
awe-inspiring.

Their pre-game performance par-

__ _._‘_j_ ___. -___‘ l

allels the pre-game performance of
Pitt’s band: the Alma Mater and
various "ﬁght’ songs are played
and of course the National Anthem
is sung. However "the halftime
show performed by the Slippery
Rock Band cannot be compared to
anything that Pitt has ever seen.
The action on the ﬁeld never stops.
Either the band is playing or the
flag girls are marching or the
majorettes are twirling or the
Rockettes are performing; all

precisely done, of course. Imagina- '

tion and excitement are intermin-
gled throughout the performance.
The band simply does not march
around the ﬁeld; it uses the pastel
colored uniforms of the dancing
Rockettes and the twirling ﬂags
and batons to create an image, both
in sight andsound. I say ‘sight and
sound’ because at this particular
game the band was accompanied
by a group of ampliﬁed bass-gui-

‘tarists standing on the sidelines.

This addition of bass guitars was
not only a “change of pace” from
the typical band—sound but made
the music sound fuller and more
alive. I was very much impressed
with the performance.

I’m certain that some people will
assume that the band had
performed a special routine be-
cause this was the championship
game:that this performance was
much better than their average
performance. This could indeed be
thecase. But I must now ask the

g: — — - — — — — q — v — — — — — — — u — ~ n — - — - u — — — — — — — — — — — — — . — — - — — — — — — — — ~ — — — — — — — - - - . . »

 

 

question, “What will Pitt’s band
perform for us that is special when
they march on the ﬁeld at the Penn
State game" (which could indeed
be classiﬁed as a championship
game for Pitt)? Will the Pitt band
have the color and action which
adds so ,much pagentry and
gallantry to a performance? Will
colors bland and intermingle, will
the formations mess and intertwine
and beckon for life as. they did at
Slippery Rock? Or will Pitt’s 118
black-and-white tin soldiers simply
play music and walk around on the

' ﬁeld? Will the people who attend

the Penn State vs. Pitt game be so
engrossed in the performance of
the Pitt band that they will remain
in their seats rather than running to
ﬁnd the nearest urinal or conces-
sion stand? At Slippery Rock the
concession stands are empty at
halftime for people refuse to leave
their seats while Slippery Rock's
band is on the field; the
performance is that entertaining.
And that’s the important word--en-
tertaining. Pitt’s present military
style is simply not conducive to an
entertaining performance; after all,
when was the last time that the
United States military was enter-
taining?

. I hope in the coming months,

when the University reviews the
present style of the band it will
make. the decision to rid the Pitt
band of its frustrating military
style. I hope the decision is made to

Ambiguity in
The Pitt News

near Editor,

I would like to address the issue 01"
ambiguity. May’ I call your

attention to two Pitt News articles--
Education Profs Charge Unfair
Labor Practices (Wednesday, Oct.
9, 1974) andLabor Board Ends Suit
Over “Unfair” Pitt Policy (Mon-
day, Nov. 18,1974).

. particularly in light of the nature 0 

  
   
   
   
   
 
    
   
  
    
  
   
 

clear by key words such as Eduea
tion Profs, Charge, Unfair 
Practices and University Admli1l§
tration and by an accompany ,
picture of Dean Kelly. It took only
cursory glance for this readeryo
any other reader to get a clear idea
of, the essential content, of 
article. i I I 
The second article, either alone?‘
vis-a-vis the first article, was mos
ambiguous. One key word, Educa
tion, was eliminated and so one_n
longer had a handle on the schoo
in which the suit was generated.
Suddenly a speciﬁc part _ of_  
University Administration wa '
transformed into a universal “Pitt;
policy.” A cursory glance at th_'
article would not readily direct the;
readers attention to the ﬁrst article i
I ﬁnd this to be rather diversionary. _

the action of the Labor Relations“-
Board, which was to completely
dismiss the charges. And the ‘lac '
of a picture? I guess it would-b, _
difﬁcult to take a picture of ‘Pitt’.-’

 “All right,” Ted Windt boomed.
f‘Let’s pick it up."
 He glared from behind a lectem at
the two hundred students fidgeting
in front of him, in too-small chairs,
his Paul Newman blue eyes
whipping them. The hum stopped,
and his listeners squeezed their
pencils, notebooks ready. The only
sound was the whoosh of denim
covered buttocks sliding on molded
plastic seats.

“The Cuban Missile crisis.” he
began, twirling the gold ring on his
pinky,‘ “was when I ﬁnally ‘got
interested in politics beyond the
point of being just a casual
observer. Here these guys were, on
 the brink of blowing up the world. I
‘ was scared, man. After it was over,
I asked myself, what’s going on
here that these men will take that
ultimate risk, that they’d chance it
‘if’ all?”

with the brown mustache who had
captivated their friends, his former
students.

Like the theatre director he once
was, he controlled the audience like
a puppeteer manipulates his
dummies, signaling them to laugh,
to question, to be silent. He fielded
questions he welcomed with a
smile. Like the politicians he
studied, he also avoided the tough‘
ones. His standard professorial,
put-off -- “l’II discuss that when we
get to so-and-so later,” was rarely
challenged.

A city boy who described his old

» neighborhood in Houston as “right

around the corner from where Dean
Corll killed those 27 kids,” Windt
was unhappy at Texas Lutheran.
He didn’t fit in with the “good ole
boys” from the nearby hills. The
school’s conservatism finally con-
vinced him to abandon the
ministry. He fell into theater after
graduation, a likely happenstance

for someone who had performed ‘

publicly since age 12, first as a
musician, and later as a singer and
comedian. A

Later, a dispute over a production
he was heading while a graduate
student at Ohio State led him to
abandon three years of work in
theater, his passion, in favor of a
doctorate in speech, a move which
meant starting all over.

At the same time, the shock of a
real nuclear threat, as manifested
by the missile crisis, blasted
Windt. The detached beat, who

where his involvement in a
ﬂedgling black students movement
there in 1968 heightened his
academic interest in politics.
Windt had frequently scored
Kennedy "for ignoring the civil
rights issue which the performer-
turned-professor had believed in
deeply even before his missile

Johnson was more sensitive to
black problemsthan his predeces-

“Kennedy, as president, made

class, striking a blow at the lions in
their den, “that is, civil rights in
the SOUTH...but don’t send them
into my neighborhood or my
school.” '

Despite an affection for his fellow
Texan, Windt scored Johnson for
and
Kennedy for his conservatism prior
to a powerful showing in the 1962
off year elections. I

“John F. Kennedy,” he said,
ﬁngering a button on his jacket
cuff, “in. his Berlin speech in
August, 1961 created one of the
most peculiar episodes in our
history.” Windt lectured now,
speaking slowly and enunciating as
an ex-actor should, never shouting,
yet never inaudible to students at
the back of the cavernous room.
His words teased, like the
omnipresent sunglasses, a remnant
of his beat days years ago, which
only came off occasionally unless
he was facing a class.

He read mockingly from a section
of the speech. “‘Tomorrow I am
asking of the Congress new funds
for the following immediate objec-
tives: to identify and mark space in
existing structures -- public and
private -- that could be used for
fallout shelters in case of attack; to
stock those shelters with food,
water, first-aid kits and other
minimum essentials for our surviv-
al...”’ The actor paused, and paced
in front of the blackboard, scanning
the room.

“What we’re talking about, which
some of you may remember, is the
great fallout shelter boom of 1961.

“Being at a totally apolitical stage
of my life, into the theater and
whatnot at this ‘time, I wasn’t
aware of the craze which followed
Kennedy’s request of Congress.

“I was in El-Paso shopping for a
house. Every one we looked at had
this BIG THING in the backyard,
man. I’d ask the realtor, ‘What’s
that? A septic tank?’ ‘No, that’s yer
fallout shelter.’

“A perverse, high-toned public
debate followed on the morality of
fallout shelters. Panels of clergy-
men would discuss whether you

' have the right not to let strangers

into your fallout shelter during a
nuclear attack. Do you have the
right to KILL your neighbor if
necessary to keep him out?
PERVERSE, man. This was a
unique part of American history all
caused by that speech.

“For all the talk about the
Kennedys and their artistry,” he
mused, “what do we call the
Kennedy administration? Camelot.
Which is probably accurate, since
Camelot never was. Just ‘a lousy,
sentimental Broadway musical.”
Windt rubbed his mustache,
breathing easier, a performer who
just belted his show stopper.
Closing his notebook, he nodded,
the audience wanting more, and
said, “Next time.”

PHOENIX, Ariz. AP
Grehyound Bus Lines and the
Amalgamated Transit Union
reached a tentative agreement
Sunday to end a week-long strike
by bus drivers and other workers,
negotiators announced.

Both the company and the union
urged employes to return to work
immediately. —

“We’ll have the buses rolling
later today,” said Greyhound
president James Carrigan.

“We’re urging drivers and other
members to go back to work
imediately. Some are going right

now,” said E.B.,Frankling, chair-

man of the union's "national council.

The strike, which began last
Monday, shut down Greyhound
service throughout the country.
The line normally carries 190,000
passengers a day. About 16,000
Greyhound employes were idled.

Terms of the three-year contract
were not disclosed pending a
ratification vote by the union,
which represents drivers and

Well, literature buffs, winter is
here. It’s time to curl up on the
couch in front of the ﬁre and stroke
the dog’s back with your wool-
socked foot and read a book. Get
mellow, and that’s exactly what
these books are good for. There’s
.nothing overly exciting or deaden-
ing about them. They exist, they
have the potential to do a number
of things to an individual’s head,
but they ain’t going to set any new
literary precedents or whatever.
have a unique
approach to their subject. Both are
somewhat successful, but neither
brings it off with the ease and
consistency which make a work
outstanding. They said the Beatles
wouldn’t last either, “And of
course they were right.”

Breaking away from gross over-
generalizations, we ‘will now be

i~'=-moving into -some disgusting de-

tailed generalizations.

The reason I chose Turkish
Delight, from a list of possible
books to review, was that it was
described as a “novel of the flesh”
and I assumed it was dirty. It
wasn’t. It’s a story about an artist
who falls madly in love with a high
fashion queen, who mends her
ways and becomes organic only to

,l‘Ig’,,..\return to her ‘social ways, leaving

him to masturbate. At the end of
the book the error of her "ways
results in her mental destruction
and, ultimately, her death. Her
husband is left empty handed
[disillusioned with intersexual
relationships] and sadder, but of
course wiser. O
Wolkers has, however, a refresh-
ing approach to‘ a pretty worn out
theme. I can’t imagine Ryan

' O'Neil beating off in front of a

picture of Ali McGraw (at least not
in the context of the over popular
ﬁlm) nor would I expect to see
Olivia Hussey pissing on Leonard

M" Whiting’s head (God, I hope not).

There was alot of that kind of good
stuff in Turkish Delight. My first
reaction was “This man’;3 sick.”
But I forced myself to read on,

keeping _my plastic wastebasketi

and a dampened towel well within
reach (note the sarcasm).

Wolkers describes a life style and
the resulting love style, art style,
and death style in a way, not
always believable, not aiways
tasteful, but different, sometimes

shocking and closer. to heing real '

 perhaps it is for his lack of artistry;

for making this literary picture into
a snapshot instead inf an oil. I’m

I attribute much of the Siyii.~.‘~LlC_
problems such as choppy sentence

Neil YOUI19 ‘Journeys’ to Film

BY DOUG GEBHARD
“We translate it into words to
reassure ourselves.” (Stephen
Stills from Journey Through the
Past).

I hate to start this review this way
but I can ﬁnd no other way of
describing the way in which I’m
about to analyze this ﬁlm...but...
don't see thisimovie if you don’t
like Neil Young! It's much too
personal of a ﬁlm for a non-Neil
freak to witness and then come out

sayin’, “See,iwhat did I. tell ya’ '

Martha? That Neil ‘Young can’t
sing, let alone make a movie.”
And so now if you haven't left me
for those admittedly rude" com-
ments ‘we'll get down to business.
The business being this: Why has
this ﬁlm been out for nearly two
years and not distributed? Well,
after it was completed, Neil talked
about the making of his movie in
Rolling Stone. It was a surrealistic
movie, he said and he did some of
the ﬁlming, directing and editing.
It was a ﬁlm about his life...its ups
and downs and the way it changed.
It was going to have a lot of music
in it...Springﬁeld, CSN&Y and
Stray Gators. And that was about
it. Plus, he added, no one owned it,
like Warner Bros., so he would
travel around with it, and show it at

college campuses or small theatres. ,
Needless to say, it was sold to‘

Warner and has been distributed.

This film is not a documentary. It
is a series of- images pieced
together by an underlying theme of
eternal change...“the world is
turning, I hope it don't turn away.”

NEIL YOUNG on his film Journey Through the Past, “the world is "

turning, I hope it don’t turn away.” \

The first scene without Neil is a
desert shot in which a Mercedes
limousine stops and drops off a
body...zooming in on the person we
see it is a freak in a_ graduation robe
with a diploma in his hand. He has
been beaten and trying to "collect
himself, stands and walks...
dazedly and confusedly he makes it
to a point where he can see a city
off in the distance. '

When Star Trek was renewed for a

show would beiaired on 8 pm on

sudden last minute decision, that
time slot was unconditionally given
to Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, for
as long as they could keep those
money spenders watching.

Tired and frustrated from ﬁghting

Carnegie Music Hall
Amplifies Chapel Concert

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER
Saturday evening, November 16,
the Heinz Chapel Concert Choir
presented “A Baroque Entertain-
ment,” featuring music of Purcell
and Monteverdi, in an evening of
works very seldom performed--and
in this case, very well performed.
Carnegie Music Hall was the
perfect place for this performance.
Its sheer opulence, which never
ceases to amaze me, was very
appropriate for this sort of music.
Considering all the good perfor-
mances by very ﬁne musicians--
yes, singers are musicians--it’s
hard to know just where to begin.
Certainly much credit is due Don
Franklin, director of the Heinz
Chapel Choir. Franklin directed

the entire concert while playing the
main continuo part at the harpsi-
chord. He has been a leading
figure in introducing Baroque and
medieval music to this city.‘

The orchestra sounded quite
good, and while there were oc-
casional problems, the intonation
of the strings was remarkably
good. Colin and Roberta Sterne
added to the orchestra with their
fine recorder playing.

The second half of the perfor-
mance consisted of madrigals of
Monteverdi concerned with the
general theme of love, as well as a
scene from Monteverdi"s unbeliev-
ably male-chauvinist opera, Il Ballo

(Continued on Page 11)

let the socially redeeming value ‘‘

come through. It’s too bad.

The author’s approach..was really
interesting. She told the story
twice, once for children and once, I
guess, for adults. The children’s

version was shorter, sketchy,‘

shallow and could not stand alone.
The adult version was more in
depth, discussions of the “ways of
the world” by the ‘characters. I
read more like an essay in parts. In
general, the land beyond is what-
ever an individual wants it to be;
the known, the unknown, the truth,
lies. It is discovered by an explorer
and later by other, as we all must
ultimately do. i
Also, as a translation, it reads ok.

The scenes are pretty, the illustra-
tions real nice. Even the ending’s
good, the whole thing is just too
obvious, too much handed to you
on a platter. I really don't know
who it was written for. If you run
across a copy, read it. If you can
get it in paperback, read it. It’s
worth the time. It’s a happy book.
But, the hardback is relatively too
expensive. Besides, this one
wasn’t dirty either.

Mezzo-soprano Janet Kane per-

bass, was exceptionally good in his
performance of Pluto, in II Ballo.

blending quite well with the other
soloists--not always an easy task for

seem fragile at times, yet it is
capable of considerable technical
virtuosity. He was primarily
involved in four airs in the Purcell’
work. '
In aniinterview Collins mentioned
how much he enjoyed doing music
from this period, and the enjoy-
ment could be sensed by everyone
there. He was deeply involved with

each note of the music, and made it
come alive.

The dance ensemble, directed by
Bernice Rosen, added color to ll
Ballo della -Ingrate. Unfortunately,
owing to the tempo of the music,
their dancing was, in some spots,
very difficult to bring off, and due
to such a ‘brief appearance, they
lacked the opportunity to show
their abilities.

An absolutely indispensible part
of the program was the choir itself,
and its several quite capable solo-
ists. Along with the orchestra, it
was the anchor on which all the
other performers pivoted.

All toldf the concert was a
tremendous success. Fortunately,
someone had the insight to include
aicomplete text of the sung parts,
along with a translation from the
Italian, where appropriate.

One problem with the concert,
however, was that it was simply too
long. It began at 8:30, and
continued to nearly 11 pm. One or
two of the Madrigali Amorosi could
have been omitted without iniuring
the structure ofthe evening.

The Heinz Chapel Choir will give
its annual concert of Christmas
music on December 8, at 3 pm, in
Heinz Chapel. If it’s anything like
the calibre of this last performance,
it will be superb.

Letter Proof of Wide Appeal   -

“Star Trek": A Living Death“

production in a few months after
Roddenberry’s departure.

The other question that is most
frequently asked about Star Trek
is, “Why do its fans remain so loyal
now that is has been gone for
years.” I think that questions is
best answered by studying the
nature of the show’s fans.

Star Trek was the only television
program ever endorsed by MEN-
SA, the high IQ society. More
important, its fans today are unbe-
lievably loyal and well-informed
about the show. _

In order to exemplify that dedica-
tion, the following is a‘ letter that
this writer received a few days ago.
It is a letter from a bed-ridden boy
of 13 named Leslie Labbouf. Les
has been in Children’s Hospital
most of this year, and he probably
won’t be back to school until after
Christmas.

Despite this adversity, Les took
the time to write to the Pitt News
about the Star Trek trivia quiz. ,
That letter appears here in its

entirety, with no corrections what-

soever.
To the editors,

I would like to piont out a‘ few
mistakes in your Star Trek quiz
wich appeard in Pitt News October
30, 1974.

1. Mr Spock was part Vulcanian in
the first season then it was changed
to Vulcan.

2. The new navigations ofﬁcer in
the animated series is Arex. He is
an unknown alien, not a bird.

3. “The Menagerie” won a Hugo
too. It was about a trial concerning
Mr. Spock’s act of treason. I have a
better quiz on the back of this page,
it requires more research. See how
much, you know about Star Trek.

 Gold Taps Blue In Preview, 74- 69

 

~ former,

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN
Pitt's two top basketball recruits
staged a personal duel that stole
the show at the Blue-Gold intra-

' squad preview game Saturday

night at the Field House.
Much-heralded Melvin Bennett, a

’ 6-7 forward from Pittsburgh's

Peabody High School, overcame
apparent early jitters to become the
game's outstanding defensive per-
leading both sides in
rebounds [12] and blocked shots
[4].

And 6-6 forward Larry Harris,
from Clearview High School in
Lorain, Ohio, hit eight of 14 shots
and led the victorious Gold squad
with 19 points, despite facing

1 Bennett’s tenacious defense much’

of the time.

The Bennett-Harris duel ulti-
mately decided the game. Ben-
nett’s Blue squad fought back
quickly after trailing 41-31 at
halftime, and most of the second
half was nip-and-tuck. With 2:15
left, a graceful 25-foot jumper by
Harris broke a 69-69 deadlock,
sending the Gold ahead.

The Gold squad took the oppor-
tunity to practice freezing the ball,
a necessary skill in college basket-
ball. Blue guard Tom Richards
ended the stall by tripping Harris
with 1:04 remaining, and the
freshman sank his first free throw
in a one-and-one situation to make
it 72-69.

After the Blue squad threw away
its outlet pass on the rebound of

Harris’ second foul shot, Bennett
had little choice but to foul Harris,
and Harris this time scored twice
on one-and-one to end the scoring
at 74-69.

Coach Buzz Ridl was pleased with
his team's performance, especially
at such an early stage, even though
the patterned offenses occasionally
degenerated into undisciplined
street ball. ’

“We certainly don’t want them to
be hesitating at this stage,” Ridl
said. “We have to see what they
can do. .They can’t play without
mistakes. No one can. But when
they learn from their mistakes,
they'll become confident, not
foolish.”

Junior center Willie Kelly was the
only player to score 20 or more
points. hitting nine of 15 from the
floor _for 22 Blue points. Other
notable Blue performances were by
Kirk Bruce (5-for-10) and Jim Bolla
(7 pts., 10 rebounds).

Outstanding for the victorious
Gold were 1 Keith Starr (()-for
11), Lew Hill (12 pts., 9 rebounds),
Bob Shrewsbury (4-for-S plus 2
steals), and transfer Ralph Mc-
Clelland from Allegheny Commun-
ity College (l0 pts.). The Gold
squad won despite being outshot
(44.8% to 40.8%) and outrebound—
ed (57-41).

Ridl expects to enter the season
opener with Ohio Northern next
Saturday using a starting five of
Richards, Bruce, Starr, Kelly and

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

A year ago yesterday at State
College, the Cinderella Pitt Pan-
thers played three of their best
quarters of the season, and led
heavily favored Penn State, 13-11.

But in the fourth, the stronger,
more experienced Lions rolled to 24
points and a 35-13 win. Experience
and strength may have caught up
with the Lions since then, however:
their graduation losses were more
severe than the Panthers’ [John
Cappelletti, Gary Hayman, Randy
Crowder, Ed O’Neil, et al], and
fewer newcomers have softened
those losses. _

Tom Shuman still handles PSU’s
quarterbacking. He’s completed
52.9% of his passes, but has
averaged less than seven yards per
attempt, and thrown six intercep-
tions, against the likes of Iowa and
Wake Forest. His top receiver is
split end Jerry Jeram, who aver-
ages only two catches per game.

third straight year, will carry the
Big Ten colors in the Rose Bowl
game New Years Day when they
play Southern California.

The decision was reached Sunday
after a secret ballot of conference

athletic directors following Ohio .

State’s 12-10 victory over Michigan
Saturday, which left the two teams
tied for the conference champion-
ship.

Each athletic director was given a
ballot with 10 choices. Each made
a selection and then turned in the
unsigned, but sealed ballot.

Conference Commissioner Wayne
Duke and a conference attorney
then counted the votes before
announcing Ohio State the winner.
Duke did not reveal details of the
voting.

The only thing anyone can be sure

. of is the vote had to be an (Ohio

State majority. If it had been a 5-5
tie, then Michigan would have
been selected since Ohio State last
represented the Big Ten in the
Rose Bowl. .

Duke said there was no set
criterion for the voting. Each
athletic director made his own
decision after a discussion and a
review of movies of- Saturday's
game. .

Asked if the conference would
change itsprocedures to determine
the Rose Bowl team from “most
representative" to a hard set of
rules, Duke said: ,

“We have a committee which
constantly reviews our policy.”

All 10 teams were on the ballot
because each -was eligible to be
selected. l

Duke added that there is some
sentiment for allowing Big Ten
teams to go to more than one bowl,
but there are “many factors invol-
ved."

It was the second year of voting
heartbreak for the Michigan Wol- ,
verines who were shut out of the

Rose Bowl last year following a _

10-10 tie with Ohio State.
Michigan last went to the Rose
Bowl in 1972, when it lost to
Stanford 13-12. Ohio lost to
Southern Cal 42-17 in the 1973
game but avenged that loss last
New Year’s Dayiwith a 12-21
trouncing of Southern Cal.

With the confidence of his teammates, BOB MEDWID will lead the
Panthersjn the most important game of his career and of several other
seniors. Medwid has had two weeks to prepare and should be ready.

either Bennett or Bolla. “But we
expect to use about 10 men
regularly,” Ridl said, the other
four likely being Hill, McClelland,
Shrewsbury, and, of course,
‘Harris. I
“I was real pleased with Harris’
v“'\ first showing in Pittsburgh," Ridl
said. “He hasn’t played with big,
strong players in high school, like
Mel has, but he’ll definitely play
some. .

“Bennett may not start, but
starting isn’t that important, be-
cause the playing time will be
about equal. I-le’ll»score some for

us, but we won’t look to him as a.
big scorer. He’Il help in rebound-
ing, and that’s an area we need
help in.”

“I really try just to play all-
around,” Bennett agreed. ‘‘I don’t
score too well, so I try to block
shots, rebound, play defense, and
pick things up off the floor.”

In contrast to last year, when
Mickey Martin barely succeeded in
becoming the only Panhter to score
half as many points (306) as Bill
Knight'(609), Ridl expects balan-
ced scoring from this year’s team.
“It’s very doubtful anyone will
average in the 20’s," Ridl gaid. “In

opponents to exceed 10 points last
year, has given that figure to‘ seven

powerhouses as Army and Ohio
Who. ’

The point of all this is that while
Penn State was a bona fide power
house which deserved its No. Five
national ranking in ’73, it has
slipped very noticeably since.

That may seem obvious since they
stand 8-2 instead of 10-0, but the
prevailing view seems to be that
they were merely unlucky in play-
ing Navy in a monsoon, and NC
State when the Pack was super-
psyched to prove itself after losing
to archrival North Carolina.

Another prevailing view seems to
be that Pitt, even with a healthy
Bill Daniels, cannot compete with
the nation’? super teams; and
without Daniels, forget it.

fact, I’ll be concerned if one guy
does. Balance is the key.”

To be sure, the Panthers showed
flashes of brilliance on offense, and
solid evidence of enough potential
to duplicate last season’s defensive
success. But, since Giuseppe
Garibaldi looked like a great mili-
tary leader only when fighting
other Italians, it remains for the
Pitt cagers to show their talent
against something else than other
Panthers.

The tough '74-’75 schedule opens
with a sneaky-tough opponent.
“They won 16 or 18 games last

year,” said Ridl of Ohio Northern. _

the kind of team for which quarter-
backing is all-important. Bob
Medwid is a competent QB, about
as competent a replacement as
Larry Feltonproved to be for Mike
Bulino, and not that much more
essential to the team's success.

And second, with either No. 7 or
No. 8 at quarterback, they can stay
on the field with Notre Dame, or
USC, or anyone else.

The next myth which remains to
be shattered says that Penn State is
still a Top Five-calibre team,
despite the bad luck that has kept
them away from that honor, and
that they are out of Pitt’s class.

But-the Nittany Lions are mere
mortals, just like Stanford, Navy
and West Virginia. And Pitt, "with
the greater motivation (eight
straight losses to their hated
rivals), should be the people's (and

Coach Len Barcalow blamed the
outcome of the game on bad
officiating on the part of the
referee. “The ..game got out oi
hand right after the opening face--
off,”_'said the Panther hockey
mentor.

Rick Vernon, one of Pitt’s top
players, conveyed the same feel-
ings. “Bad officiating, really bad.
That’s what blew the game,”
stated the Panther right winger.

The game started out as a slugfest
but the ‘worst ‘did not come until
defenseman Russ Stump had sev-
eral of his teeth rearranged by’ a
cheap shot from a Gannon player.
The Panthers, in an effort to
retaliate, only irritated the Knights
further.

Thevcontest was marred not only
by the officials inability to control
the actions of the players, but also
by the teams both displaying the
aggressive squads they bill them-
selves to be. High-sticking, slash-
ing, an_d roughing calls were num-
erous and finally led to the calling
of the game in the second period.

Following four penalty calls by the
referee with 11:18 gone, Coach
Bruce Kravis, an aggressive per-
former in his own playing days with
the Erie Lions, was dealt a bench
penalty for protesting the calls.

by the shirt and thus prompted the
official to call a forfeit against the
Gannon team. By'this time, the
ame was so out of hand that it is
uncertain whether it could have
been successfully resumed.

The refere for the game was the
same one who cut short a game last
season between the Panthers and
Penn State which also got overly
violent.

Hopefully the Cats will forget

i Bradshaw Starting QB

NEW ORLEANS AP - Pittsburgh
quarterback Terry Bradshaw was
given the starting nod for the
Steelers’ Monday night National
Football League game with the
improving New Orleans Saints.

Bradshaw pulled down the as-
signment, ending speculation as to
which of Pittsburgh’s trio of
quarterbacks would get.the start.
Coach Chuck Noll’s system of
rotating quarterbacks Bradshaw,
Joe Gilliam and Terry Hanratty has
been the talk of Steeler fans.

“I think having three" quarter-
backs is a bonus, not a problem,”
linebacker Andy Russell said. “We
don’t use the rotating quarterback

system, by design - it's just that,

none of the three has really taken
over enough to win the job."
The Steelers, in ﬁrst place in the
American Football Conference
Central Division, are looking for a
trip to the Super Bowl while the
scrambling Saints are looking for

respect.

Despite New Orleans’ 4-6 record,
the Steelers are approaching the
Saints with caution. The Saints
were sky high after suddenly
putting together an offense to
match their solid defense and
upsetting Los Angeles 20-3 last

3 week.

. “We have seen ﬁlm on the Saint’s
offense and it presents some
interesting situations, ’ ’ said Rus-
sell, Pittsburgh’s defensive cap-
tain. “But we can adjust.”

He referred to the changed New
Orleans attack on the Rams that
used four wide receivers, just one
running back and no tight end.

The rejuvenated Saints’ offensive
line must deal with a Pittsburgh
defense that leads the NFL in take
aways, with 20 interceptions and 18
fumble recoveries, plus topping the
NFL in quarterback sacks with 40,
and in total defense.

“But out front four will have to be

aware of Archie Manning’s
scrambling ability,” said Russell.
"Sometimes you can do a good job
initially and then the scramble kills
you.” _

In three prior stops in New
Orleans, Pittsburgh fared“ poorly.
, “We are 0-3 in that stadium,”
said Russell. “But we won for the
first time in 10 years in the
Cleveland stadium last week and I
hope we can do it again in New
Orleans.”

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

When its all over at Three Riv-
ers Stadium Thursday night. I
want you to remember just one
' thing. regardless of the final out-
come of the game. how many
yards Tony Dorsett and Elliot
Walker roll up or even how Joe
Paterno may have the last laugh
after all. Just remember that
/"W-$£_ie_\'nold Stoner played one hell of
S a game.

Stoner, if you may not know, is
one of those faceless hulks of
anonymity that opens the holes
for the Dorsetts and Walkers.
Yes, he’s one of those offensive
lineman, left guard to be exact,
who never recieves more than a
pat on the ass for smacking heads
and taking cracks his counter-
parts love to save for quarter-
backs.

Recognition—it’s what sports
are all about these days. It‘s the
drive to be the best. not only in
your own eyes. but in those of
others. That‘s when it feels the

‘ﬂaybest. _ _

Yet for Stoner. those moments
.haven’t been very frequent. even
in the wave of resurgent success
Johnny Majors has directed. Sure.
there‘s been the success of the
team- and that’s what coaches
anywhere drill into the minds of
their players. especially offen-

X‘, sive lineman.

-v 1
A

\ Now I’ve known him since fresh-
man year, 1971, when he used to
walk into my room in Tower A,
rubbing his ‘constantly injured
shoulder and asking me for spare
Darvon. I’ve seen him suffer, yes
I do mean suffer, through two
years of Carl DePasqua, and then
celebrate with Majors.

There were never too many

_ times when I could say our heads
’r"',"?”‘-vvere in the same place at the
'  same time. especially in those
first two years.‘ It’s just that Rey-

nold Stoner. like so many other
offensive lineman. like the rest of

-the Pitt offensive front. is what

- you can only call completely dedi-.

cated.

And for once. maybe the first
time. I really share a feeling with
him. Naturally that is regarding
the “Turkey Bowl" Thursday

night and the «mutual concern is. ‘

the total annihilation of Penn
State; the complete embarrass-
ment of Joe Paterno.

This isit for Stoner. The lack of
"'-. recognition given him has exten-
ded itself so thoroughly into some

of the closest corners in his re-
cent career. Thursday night will

' probably be the last football game

he'll ever play.

His emotions might be consi-
dered vindictive. toward the lack
of publicity and contact a lineman
of his caliber deserves. toward
the snubbihg Pitt took at the hands
of the bowl officials or just toward
State. It doesn‘t matter which.
Hes just out to prove a point.

“Penn State is more important
to us than any bowl game could
be,” Soner said. “A win will firm-
ly establish us as the best heam in
the East, which we should be right
now, based on the records against
Eastern and common opponents.

“Penn State received a Cotton
Bowl bid on reputation and past
performances." he added. “That‘s
how it always is. We have to go
out.and keep winning week after
week to prove ourselves while
Penn State goes out. and if they
lose. well it’s overlooked. or ‘they
had a bad game.”

There's more to it than a team
victory this time around. He
usually doesn’t admit it. but now
Stonercan talk somewhat freely
about his personal motivations.
probably his last ones.

“People have told me I couldn’t
do the job,” he said. “They used
to talk about me playing with pain

Guard REYNOLD STONER typiﬁes the attitude of the football team

more than anything else. That
really bothers me, the lack of
true recognition. But it’s always
been something you could never
let get you down.

“Two years ago. there wdre
some guys that , didn't give a'
damn." Stoner continued. "but
self respect is an important thing
to me. I could never play like that
and have it reflected on me. You
have,to play with self pride so
you can live with yourself."

In the beginning of the season.
it was declared that the hopes of
Panther football rested squarely
on the shoulders of a celatively
green offensive line. one which
Stoner and center Mike Carey
were the only veterans. Well the
season has run its course and it
can‘t be denied Pitt has indeed
had a good year. The Thanksgiv-
ing clash with State will merely
be the frosting on the cake.

“The Penn State game is a cul-
mination of all feelings penned up
inside,” Stoner said. .“I’m going
to let out all the things that both-
ered me internallythat I?d never
let show on the outside.”

Another added incentive for
Stoner will be the renewal of a
personal rivalry with Mike Har-
tenstine. Paterno’s blue chip de-
fensive lineman of the yearjan old

adversary of Stoner‘s from high ,

school.



and their determination to upset Penn State Thursday and cop the
;Lambert Trophy. A senior, Stoner will be in his last performance for
Pitt and is._bound to make a victory.

"Last year he played pretty

S()ME STRAIGHT TALK TO THE 
PROSPECTIVE STEREOBUYER

The common notion that all hi-fi dealers are the same is ’ ’ '
 ere s ne ur ig y

The dealer you buy from is very important.'Ev'en among
the various audio component specialists. you’ll find important T A
differences. They’re generally broken down into four distinct  m m e n  S t m
areas: price, selection, warranty, and service. '  e 

At this point, it's impossib1e’for us to stay modest. We excel ’
over our competition in all four areas above. ~ ~‘ \

That’s a pretty broadstatement, but we can back it up as T .. '   * - -
follows.

Price. If, within 30 days of purchase. you discover any au-
thorized dealer selling the same equipment with comparable
guarantee for a lower price, bring in the proof and The Audio
Warehouse will gladly refund the difference. Likewise, of
course, we'll beat this quote if you haven’t purchased yet.

Selection. We carry most,major brands and only brnad
name products (no private label). If you don't see a particular
item or brand, ask: we have many products in stock for immedi-
ate delivery that may not be on display in the particular store
where you’re shopping. _

.Wai-ranty. We're one of the miniscule number of hi-ti deal-
ers whose warranty is actually better and longer than most
of the manufacturers themselves:

We guarantee the speaker system iparts and labor) five AL I 1, I _ .
years. So the Advent or Pioneer speaker you buy from us is .. ,,,_ I/k,,do.. 330 3
different than the Advent or Pioneer you could buy from the a   I ‘-1; ’ '
dealer down the street. ' V "

We guarantee the electronic components (parts and labor)
3 yrs. The turntable or changer-or tape deck (repair) 1 year.
Parts subject to wear. such as stylii, tape heads. belts. etc..
are guaranteed for 90 days only. ' -

We also have a money back guarantee in case you change
your mind within 7 days.

And a 100% equipment exchange program if you prefer
something else within 90 days (we'll credit you full price toward

the purchase of any other component or combination of compo- 2  m a H Ie r A    '

nents at the normal list price). ‘
We have a one year speaker exchange. as follows. The Audio G I b   T _ b |
