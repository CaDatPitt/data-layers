University Registration
Increase

Shows Decided

<°>

Registrar Lists
Upward Trend

Registration for the 152nd year
at the University showed substan-
tial increases in most of the 18
schools and divisions at the middle
of the enrollment period this week,
J. G. Quick, registrar, announced.
Additional registrations during the
week should make the total in-
crease more than 350 students.

Undergraduate schools and the
Graduate School had an increase
of more than 200 students when
incomplete ﬁgures were available.
The School of Engineering, with
195 freshmen showed an increase
of 5 per cent over last year’s fresh-
man enrollment. Enrollment in all
four classes in engineering was 50
ahead of last year’s total.

Enrollment in the Graduate
School had reached a total of 704
which, though a decrease of more
than 100 students, equals last
year’s registration in that 116 stu-
dents registered in the new School
of Applied Social Sciences would
have been listed under Graduate
School last year. The new school,
to train social workers, is a sepa-
rate graduate division for the ﬁrst
time this year.

Enrollment in the School of
Business Administration showed an
increase of 32 students, and the
School of Education had an in-
crease of 14 students. The After-
noon, Evening, and Saturday divi-
sion enrollment was up 314
students.

Commenting on the large fresh-
man enrollment in all undergradu-
ate schools, J. G. Quick, registrar,
said, “The majority of the mem-
bers of the freshman class are stu-
dents who were graduated in the
first two-ﬁfths of their high school
graduating classes. It is one of the
best groups of students from the
standpoint of scholarship and extra-
curricular attainment that we have
admitted to the University in
years.”

New Tuck Shop
Oﬂers Varied Menu

An enlarged menu and expanded
quarters will be provided for Tuck
Shop customers this year, accord-
ing to an announcement by Mrs.
Alice Wilker, director of the shop,
located on the ground floor of the
Cathedral.

The usual menu, consisting of
sandwiches, home-made pies and
cakes and all the trimmings, will
soon be augmented by hot dishes,
Mrs. Wilker said. These will in-
clude hot roast beef sandwiches,
vegetables, and soup, and will be
served just as soon as equipment
can be obtained.

Additional space will also be
provided along the Bigelow boule-
vard side of the Cathedral, which
will almost double the floor space
of the shop. No date, however, has
yet been set for the completion of
the new wing.

Mrs. Wilker, who is always on
hand behind the counter, is also
manager of the University cafe-
teria. She promises “service with a
smile” between the business hours
of 8 to 8.

Wednesday afternoon at 3 :30 o’clock

“The student body accepts the

demonstration block ch a i rm a n,
when he announced a turnout of
600 members in two days as the
result of the posters announcing
the registration for the third year

Three hundred more seats are
left for students who want to join
in the show. Names will be taken
until the total is reached in the
demonstration block headquarters,
801 Cathedral, Ellis said. First
showing of the 1939 group will be
at tomorrow’s West Virginia foot-
ball game and so conﬁdent is Ellis
and his committee that this will be
done with no rehearsal.

Equipment for the block mem-
bers will be distributed and col-
lected at the game by the 30 section
leaders who have been named. All
students who have signed up for
the block should be in their seats
by 1:45 o’clock tomorrow. After

To Mountaineers

Gridders Await
‘Tough Opener’

When West Virginia's wild
Mountaineers drop in for a few
football hours tomorrow afternoon
at 2 o’clock at the Stadium, the
Golden Panthers will face the
toughest opening that ever con-
fronted a Sutherland-coached team.

This powerful West Virginia
team scents a victory over Pitt,
and a victory over Pitt will satisfy
a decade of hunger for Panther
meat.

For Pitt the game will he first
hard contest in a schedule that
also includes Temple, Duquesne,
Wisconsin, Southern Methodist,
Fordham, Carnegie Tech, Nebras-
ka, Penn State. and Duke, in order.

For the Mountaineers tomor-
row’s game will be the high point
of the season, and a victory will
mean the “greatest season in a
decade.” The mountain boys will
have the revenge motif as just one
of their incentives.

Last year Pitt was the only
team to beat West Virginia, but
the 20-0 score is no criterion of the
game. Only a couple of lucky
breaks led to the last two touch-
downs and prevented a 6-0 score or
possible Pitt defeat.

There has been an ominous si-
lence at Morgantown since the sea-
son practice started, in contrast to
the usual enthusiasm. From all
sides come whisperings of the
prowess of this 1938 eleven.

A brilliant batch of sophomores
will buttress the galaxy of return-
ing veterans. This Mountaineer
team will be two deep in every po-
sition, and the difference between
the first two teams is very slight.

Pitt will send a veteran team
onto the ﬁeld. Dick Cassiano at
left halfback will be the lone
junior, seniors completing the line-
up. Focus of attention will be the
widely-heralded Pitt backﬁeld that
has shifted All-American Marshall
Goldberg from left-half to full, has
Stebbins and Cassiano at the half-
back saddles, and Chickerneo at the
signal-barking post.

Bill Daddio and Fabian Holl-
man will be at the ends. After a

Panthers Play Host

To West Virginia

(Continued from page 1) ,
great sophomore year, Daddio was i
hampered by injuries and couldn’t
quite hit his sophomore stride last
year. This year Daddio is back in
splendid physical condition, his leg
injuries have cleared up, and he 18
expected to regain his second year
form.

Fabian Hoffman was a regular
in his sophomore year and ‘last
year turned up at practice a little
late. By the time he rounded into
condition Frank Souchak was play-
ing an All-American game at end,
and Hoffman had to play a ﬁll-in
role. Hoffman didn’t take any
chances this year and will Step
into right end.

The starting tackles are likely
to be Elmer Merkovsky and Walter
Raskowski. The latter started the
season last year at left guard, and
after that was Lezouski’s replace-
ment. 1 i "'3'?"-'

With two years as a letterman at
this position, he has been shifted
to tackle this year. Merkovsky, an-
other senior, and also a two letter-
man, won his awards as Matisi’s
understudy.

Al Lezouski and Steve Petro will
again be back at the guard posts.
Both boys are veterans and both
carry on the tradition of great Pitt
guards.

CENTER UNCERTAIN

This will be Bob Dannies’ first
year as a regular. He did enough
relief Work last year to earn his
letter, but after mid-season played
behind Hensley and Adams. Center
was one of Sutherlands first 1938
problems. Perhaps the answer lies
in Bob Dannies.

The Panther reserves will be only
juniors and sophomores. Sopho-
more Joe Rettinger, and Junior
Johnny Dickinson hold down the
second-string end positions. The
second team tackles include Ted
Konetsky, a second-year man and
Ralph Hafer, junior, who will push
Raskowski and Merkovsky.

Harold Klein, junior, and sopho-
more Rudy Gradisek will be the
guard relief. Dick Fullerton, big
rangy junior, and Harris Hawkins
will spell off Dannies.

Ben Kish will ﬁll in at quarter-
back or full. A good passer and
hard blocker, Ben can handle either
position. Sophomores George Kra-
cum or Bob Thurbon will under-
study left-half Cassiano.

Right half reserve will be Ernest
Bonelli, a sophomore, or Emil
Naric, a junior. Mike Sekela will
play quarter or full, depending on
the spot Kish eventually ﬁlls.

The attack that the Mountain-
eers bring down from Morgantown
has Sutherland working on defen-

sive strategy, and this is the ﬁrst -

time that Pitt has emphasized the
defense for an opening game.

CLARK BACK

Last year left-half Harry Clark
gave Pitt a series of headaches in
the third period when he led the
attack to within scoring territory.
He will be back, with an improved
squad of blockers in front of him,
and with a years’ experience un-
der his belt. West Virginia papers
hail him as a potential All-Ameri-
can.

Sophomore Johnny Carliss will
be at the other half. A triple threat
man, Johnny‘ is expected to cause
a lot of grief for West Virginia op-
ponents, and the Mountaineer
coach, Sleepy Glenn has been
grooming Carliss and plans to have
him hand Pitt a dose of concen-
trated grief.

Sam Audia, a regular for the
past two years, will be back at
full back. Zipper Lorenz, at quar-
ter back rounds out the West Vir-
ginia attack. The West Virginia
line is powerful with not a weak
link from end to end, and the re-
serve line is almost on par with
the first-stringers.

This is Coach Sleepy Glenn's
second year as head coach. It was
a Glenn-coached team that gave
Pitt such a hard game last year
before succumbing to superior Pitt
reserve strength.

And it may be that same Glenn
that will give Panther rooters
cause to remember tomorrow's
opener as the sourest in years.

Tackle

Walt Raskowski

Heavyweight speedster Raskow-
ski has played two varsity years
as a guard. Tomorrow he moves to
tackle.

Those white clad ﬁgures dashing
over the Schenley Park green are
members of Coach Olson's cross-
country team, jogging into the con-
dition that will be necessary to
successfully face the stiff eight
meet schedule.

The Panther harriers may make
this the ﬁnest year in Pitt cross
country history. The returning
group of veterans will be aug-
mented by members of last year's
national championship ICAAAA
squad. Ben and Casimir Kopec, Al
Zamborski, Bob Cogswell, and Al-
lan McKee are back, and Al Bou-
langer and George McCabe are up
from the freshman team.

1 Football Manager
§Candidates Called

“Yes, we are very much inter-
ested in having some ambitious
freshmen report for a crack at the
football managership,” said Bill
McBride, varsity grid manager
and Frank Scott, manager of
equipment, in one breath.

Both McBride and Scott seemed
especially eager to have the first
year men report to either of them
any afternoon at the Stadium
dressing room.

All freshmen reporting will be
given more than a fair opportunity
to succeed on the football field, the

managers agreed.

Athletic Department Gives ‘Go’
Signal On New Intramurals

All Sports Available
To All Students

Pitt's new sports keynote-—fewer
in the grandstand—-will get a thor-
ough test this year as, for the first
time, the intra-mural program falls
under the supervision of the Ath-
letic Department.

With twenty-three sports in-
cluded on the list of ~intra-mural
athletics, almost any man with the
slightest inclination toward ath-
letics can find some sport in which
he will be interested. The program
has been divided into fall, winter
and spring sections with eight fall
sports, a similar number of winter
sports, and seven spring sports.

Included on the list are touch
football, speed ball, soccer, horse-
shoes, tennis, handball, swimming,
and cross country in the fall; bas-
ket ball, volleyball, badminton,
handball, table tennis, free throw,
bowling, and gymnastics during
the winter; and mushball, tennis,
golf, handball, horseshoes, swim-
ming, track, and ﬁeld events in the
spring.

James Potts, assistant track
coach, has been placed in charge of
the entire program, and he wishes
it made clear that while varsity
players are eligible for competition
in some sports, the program is deﬁ-
nitely not for the beneﬁt of those
boys who are already participating
on some varsity team.

To aid in carrying out the ad-
ministrative details of the pro-
gram, a voluntary corps of student
managers will be selected. These
will include a Senior manager for
each season, a manager for each
sport in each season, and individual
managers for each team.

The Senior manager and the
sports managers will be chosen by
the intra-mural oﬂice on the basis
of interest, initiative, responsibil-

ity, and scholastic rating. Team
managers will be selected by their
own organizations. Senior man-
agers will be eligible at the end of
each season for a var_sity award
such as is given managers of var-
sity teams.

Each fraternity, club, or other

 

will include points for entering a
team and playing through the
schedule, points for division cham-
pionship and runner-up, points for
each game played in elimination
series when necessary, and points
for team championships.

If, at the end of the intramural
season, two teams have the same
number of points, the trophies will
be awarded to the organization
with the higher scholastic average.

Even the Finest Fountain Pen
Perforiné Far Better

When Filled with this Modern Ink . . . A Marvelous Creation!

 

THE FORBES NATIONAL BANK

3 _or_

Created by Parker to guard pens from
pen-clogging inks . . . Ends 69% of the
fountain pen troubles

There is not——~and never has been—any other pen
designed to handle all kinds of inks—-—good and bad
——as well as the revolutionary Parker Vacumatic.
One reason is that this modern invention has no
rubber ink sac. no lever ﬁller. no piston pump. It
is filled by a simple diaphragm, sealed in the top,
where ink can never touch or decompose its
working parts.

And its patented Television barrel lets you SEE
the level of ink at all times——see when to refill.

This pedigreed Beauty of laminated Pearl and
Jet is everywhere acknowledged to be the grandest
pen ever created. Yet even this Guaranteed
Mechanically Perfect pen can be plugged up by
the grit and gum in ordinary writing inks.

Hence to guard the celebrated Parker Pens from
pen-clogging inks. Parker experts developed this
utterly new kind of writing ink-called Qui'nk—-
an ink that actually cleanses any pen as it writes.

This is done by a secret ingredient. wholly
harmless. It dissolves the gum and other trouble-
some particles left in your pen by ordinary inks. It
makes your pen a self-cleaner-—--cleans as it writes.

Parker Quin): is full-bodied. rich. and brilliant.

Never watery or gummy. And it dries on PAPER
31% quicker than average. due to stepped-up
penetration. Yet Quink costs no more than ordi-
nary inks—-small bottles, 15c and 25c.

If you use an ordinary pen. you need Quink
even more than does a Parker Pen owner to
keep it in writing condition. If you use a Parker
Pen. you'll be thrilled and surprised by the way it
performs when filled with Quink. For until we
created Quink and the Parker Vacumatic Pen.
there never was a really scientiﬁc writing com-
bination.

Those who can afford the best will not rest until
they have them both. The Parker Pen Company,
Janesville. Wis.

dent staff is organized, is ex-
perimental in size and format.
Students will later be given
opportunity to express a pref-
erence for size and frequency
of issue.

C ross Your Fingers!

Pittsburgh will be a busy
town tomorrow. Crowds will
line downtown streets for the
Sesqui parade. A pennant-
drunk throng will watch the
Pirates over at Forbes Field.

But up in the Stadium will
be an attraction that we pre-
dict will more than hold its
own with all competing at-
tractions. A Pitt team, touted
as the best in the University’s
illustrious football history,
will face one of the toughest
opening games in many years.

And for the ﬁfteenth con-
secutive year, Coach Jock
Sutherland will lead his
charges onto the ﬁeld with the
usual Sutherland crossed ﬁn-
gers. His “boys” will have to
ward off the determined
thrusts of an up-and-coming
West Virginia team.

We hope “Jock’s” team can
pass this first hurdle and
achieve all the success that
has been predicted for it. But
we realize that football games
aren’t won on paper.

So we too will keep our
ﬁngers crossed and add our
hope that this anniversary-
marking season will also be
the best.

Freshman Men Prepare
For Orientation Exams

THE PITT NEWS

 Period For Clubs

, Initiating a new policy in regard
I to freshman clubs, the YMCA has

New Students
To Get Keys

Freshmen men have been fore-
warned of a major examination
which will take place during the
fourth week of school.

At that time freshmen will be
tested on their knowledge of Uni-
versity history. traditions, person-
nel, and activities by students and
faculty members heading orienta-
tion courses.

Green pins which were awarded
at the banquet during Freshman
Week will be removed after the ex-
amination, according to Robert N.
Corley. assistant dean of men.

Students in ﬁrst-year courses of
the College and School of Business
Administration will take the test
on October 11 or 13. Engineering
students will be given the examin-
ation at their weekly seminar meet-
ing on October 11.

After eight weeks of school,
Men's Council will present special
awards to those freshmen who
have achieved distinction in the
classroom and in activities.

The awards this year will be
keys, in the official school colors,
blue and gold, representing the
Pitt Panther with the class nu-
merals. Approximately 60 of these
keys will be awarded.

Keys will be awarded at the hon-
ors assembly, to be held on the
same day as the chancelors’ recep-
tion for freshman parents. This
assembly will mark the close of the
customs period.

Classes in orientation are now
being conducted by faculty and ad-
ministrative oﬁicers with the aid of
upperclass counsellors.

College upperclassmen assisting
in the orientation program include:
Harold Viehman, Karl Stark,
James Kennedy, Bob Forsythe, J.
R. Friday,
Hoeveler, Tom Smith, Jack Kotler,
and Ray Light.

Representing the School of Busi-
ness Administration are Bernard
Cashdollar, Ed Horne, Alvin Lud-
wig, Cyrill Bielick, Sam Whiteman,
and Bob Simrell.

Plaza Will Relieve

Congestion at Doors

The campus just outside the
Fifth avenue entrance to the Ca-
thedral has proved such a popular
meeting place for students that
the department of buildings and
grounds is constructing a stone
plaza to take care of the crowds.

The plaza, of stone slabs placed
on a foundation of cinders and
sand, is to be 30 feet wide when
completed. The project will greatly
relieve congestion at the doors.

Members of Faculty Teach Classes,
Publish New Texts During Summertime

While the majority of students and faculty members were spending
routine vacations, a number of University people made the headlines of

Pittsburgh publications.

Dr. Elmer Hutchisson, acting head of the department of physics, was
responsible for a notable course instituted in the last summer school

session.

This lecture series on “The Physics of Metals” was headed by such
eminent physicists as Dr. N. F. Mott, professor of theoretical physics at

the University of Bristol, England;‘$*“*"s“""“‘”**‘“'"‘

Dr. John Bardeen, fellow at Har-
vard; Dr. Francis Bitter, associate
professor at Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology.

Brought together on a common
basis of understanding were metal-
lurgists and physicists whose re-
searches in creep, internal friction,
fatigues of metal, heretofore car-
ried on from widely-separated
points of view.

Early in July, a concise resume
of pharmaceutical law in the United
States was published, authored by
the dean of the School of Phar-
macy, Dr. C. Leonard O’Connell,
and local attorney William Pettit.
The opus is designed primarily for
Pennsylvania druggists and stu-
dents.

John K. M. Tibby, former editor
of The Pitt News, was married in
August to Miss Emily V. Fores-
man, of 1125 Hillsdale avenue, Mt.
Dormont. Tibby is now associated
with the American Institute of Pub-
lic Opinion.

Robert Ruttencutter, C39, Grace
Kovac, C38, and John Minno, Ed38,
were named scholarship winners at
the close of last semester. Rutten—
cutter was awarded six weeks of
art study in Poland by the Polish
Kosciuszko Foundation, for his
winning mural entered in competi-
tion sponsored by the Foundation
at the Syria Mosque.

Miss Kovac won a fellowship of-
fered by ‘che YWCA and will study
at Western Reserve this year while

working in th eindustrial depart-
ment of the Y there.

of Prague, Czechoslovakia. He ac-
cepted a scholarship from the In-
ternational Institute of Education
to gather material for a book on
the Carpatho-Russian people.

summer were Sophia Nelson, Gwen-
dolyn H. Marshfield, Jeannette

CA Cabinet Sets

First evening dance of the year
will be held next Friday evening,
September 30, when the College
Association stages -the annual

Side.

Dancing will be from 9 to 1

The dance, traditionally the ﬁrst

a well-known local orchestra, ac-
cording to Light.

Proceeds will go to the Student
Loan Fund maintained by the Col-
lege Association.

Funeral services for Howard Irish
and William Lenz were held early
this summer. ‘Mr. Irish, 66, was

dent of Commonwealth Trust and
Commonwealth Real Estate com-
panies. Mr. Lenz was manager of

Student's Register
For Music Course

period, J. G. Quick, registrar, an-
nounces. The course, sponsored by
Carnegie Institute of Technology,
will have lectures by John Erskine
and illustrations by the Pittsburgh
Symphony orchestra under the di-
rection of Fritz Reiner.

The Pitt students have purchased
the book of 16 tickets entitling
them to admission to the 16 lec-
tures to be held in the Carnegie

‘Music hall at 4 p.m. each Tuesday

from November 29 to April 4.

of $10 for the 16 lectures," Mr.
Quick said.
