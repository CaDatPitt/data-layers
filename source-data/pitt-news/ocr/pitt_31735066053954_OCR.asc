Central American stability

The global community.

Heads of state refer to it
in speeches and in policy pro-
posals, journalists and com-
mentators include it in their
newspapers, editorials and
television shows; and people
read, hear and see it daily in
all areas of the media.

It has become the catch
phrase of the 19903.

For Oscar Arias, former
president of Costa Rica and
Nobel Peace laureate, the
global community is some-

thing more than a buzzword,
it is something that cannot be
denied. , p

As more than 200 Pitt
administrators, faculty, and
students gathered in the lec-
ture hall of the Twentieth
Century Club Thursday to
hear the first annual Global
Integration Lecture, the inter-
national theme weaved itself
throughout his speech.

“Today’s world is a com-
pact forest of cultures, states
and nations, whose roots form
an interlacing, inextricable
network,” Ariaslsaid, using
the rain forests of Central

America as an analogy. “The
survival of each tree depends
on the well being of all of the
others. A nation traumatized
by war, by oppression, or by
poverty is the first cry of a
tree on the verge of falling. It
is an omen of danger for the
entire forest.”

Quoting a prominent
thinker from the Dominican
Republic, Arias emphasized

that Latin America must no

longer be used as’ a “territory
for the exploitation of man by
man," but instead must be
regarded as an equal playerin
international affairs.

QUILT

’ She added that the council will not be
bringing the entire quilt to Pitt, but only a
portion of it.

Fischer said there are 40,000 12 feet by
12 feet panels on the quilt, but only 65 of
them can be shown at Pitt. In total, 520 dif-
ferent people will be represented on the
quilts.

According to Fischer, Pedro Zamora,
Arthur Ashe, Keith Haring, Freddie
Mercury, and Ryan White's panels will be
among those shown at the University.
There will also be 10 international panels
— from Peru, Chile and Taiwan — shown.

"I want students to recognize there are
names behind the numbers and this. quilt
humanizes it," said Devoe. ‘

Cleve Jones began the quilt in June of

1987 in San Francisco as a protest to the
AIDS epidemic.

Fischer also encourages students to
stop by the Connie M. Kimbo Gallery in
the union to View an art exhibit named
"Angelic Images" by Joyce Marks, which
shows some of the "emotional impact" of
AIDS. According to Fischer, the displays
are black and white photographs that were
then transferred onto a hand-colored can-
vas. .
"The pictures show the emotional side

of angels with the emotional impact of

AIDS," Fischer said.

The closing ceremonies will be held on
Thursday Nov. 20 at 5 p.m.

Fischer added that the presentation of
the quilt is free for everyone to view.

MARSHFIELD, Wis. —— A woman whose
right-to-die case went to the U.S. Supreme
Court has died.

Edna Folz was 74. She hadAlzheimer’s
disease.

Folz died at a Virrsconsin nursing home,
18 days after doctors allowed her feeding
tube to be removed.

Folz's sister fought for years for permis— S

sion to have the feeding tube removed. Betty
Spahn said her sister told her she would
rather die than live helplessly.

The Supreme Court declined to review
a lower court's ruling that the tube could not
be removed because Folz was not in a per-
sistent vegetative state and had never clearly
stated her wishes.

The tube was removed days before the ’

Supreme Court ruled, when doctors deter-
mined she was in a vegetative state.
Spalm says her sister is now at peace.

Muslim leader talks religion     

during Islam Awareness Week

Brett Taylor
News Assistant

In 1989, Islam leader Imam Siraj
Wahhaj led a group of Muslims who
forced the closing of 15 crack houses on
the Brooklyn street where his mosque is
located.

The area is now a hub for Muslim-
owned businesses -with no sign of a
crack house.

Last Thursday, the nationally-
renowned speaker spoke to nearly 150
people at the David Lawrence
Auditorium for Islam Awareness Week
'97. The lecture was sponsored by the
Pitt Muslim Students Association.

"The Muslims‘ role in America is to
share the light with the people, to unite
them back to God," Wahhaj said. "The
role of Muslims is the same today as it
was 1,400 years ago when Muhammad
brought his message to the people of
Arabia.

"America is like a car with brakes
that don't work speeding down a steep
mountain with ice and snow, driven by
a blind man, who is high on drugs,"
added Wahhaj.

He explained that America spends
more money on illegal drugs than food
or health care. He also said that people
argue for women's rights but, in turn,
allow women to be displayed naked all

over billboards, magazines and on the
Internet.

Wahhaj said Muslims need to bring
the people back to God and create an
atmosphere of love and brother and sis-
terhood between all people.

When Wahhaj led the Muslim
group that stood up to the drug lords
and decided to clear their neighborhood
of drugs, he said, this happened because
the Muslims "quit preaching and started
building." .

"It is our job to get rid of the
hypocrisy, and it is our job to get rid of
the contradictions," he said. "Not just to
talk about it." ‘

Wahhaj said Islam, the Muslim reli-
gion, is the fastest growing religion in
America. He said this frightens a lot of
Americans.

According to MSA Secretary Omar
Naji, Islam is not political; it is a down-
to-earth religion. Naji said people in the
United States identify Muslims with
politics because they hear about things
happening in Palestine, Israel and, more
recently, in Iraq.

"People hear about Islam through
politics, but that doesn't mean it's polit-
ical," Naji said. "It's a religion."

Wahhaj said people hear that
polygamy is permitted under the Islam
religion, and say that this is wrong.
Wahhaj explained, however, that very

"More polygamy is practiced in
America than all the Muslim countries
combined," he said, "but they don't call
it polygamy; they call it shackin' up."

Most Americans don't realize that
Islam is not meant to compete with
Christianity and Judaism, according to
Wahhaj, but rather that it is a continua-
tion of the latter of the two faiths.

He said Muslims believe that
Christianity grew out of Judaism and
that Islam grew out of Christianity.

Muslims also believe that while
Jesus Christ was a great prophet who

actually ' practice

did many wonderful things it was
Muhammad who was sent by God later
to complete and perfect religion, he
said.

Naji said Wahhaj's visit to Pitt was
the MSA's biggest-ever event. The
MSA has been an organization for sev-
eral years but has only been recognized
by the University for the past two years.

Naji said that the MSA, by bringing
Wahhaj to Pitt, is trying to show that
Muslims are a part of the community
and to foster understanding of what
Islam is all about.

"Islam is the greatest gift in
America," Wahhaj said.

among numerous other awards ‘Id
accolades. ~
Currently a member of numerous

peace “foundations, Arias professed
his dedication to work toward Central '

American stability. In his speech he
pinpointed his opposition to high-
technology weapons trade as an
important means to accomplish this
goal. A
While, members of the audience
sat attentively, some precariously on
the edge of their chairs seemingly
concentrating on every . '
syllable uttered by the
smallish man’s mouth,
shot-gun loud claps and
whoops could be heard
as Arias called for an
end to arms trafficking.
Citing Clinton’s
recent decision to
reverse the decades-old
policy banning the sale
of high-tech weapons to
Latin America,- Arias
said, “It is paradoxical

justify arms trafficking
as a natural response to
an existing demand,
while at the same time
they insist that drug traf-
ﬁcking be restricted on
the supply side.

“For many, this comparison may
seem rather drastic; however, there is
no doubt that both types of sales
export death and misery,” he said.
“The fact that selling arms is consid-
ered legal while selling drugs is not
does not make the first morally defen-
sible.” ‘

Despite asking the United States
to use its resources and power to
assuage Latin America's social ills
and relieve itself of its “complacent
inaction” within global society, Arias
also encouraged Latin America to
take responsibility for its actions.

“Although we have regular elec-
tions, ‘more than 200 million human
beings are living and dying in pover-
ty,” Arias said. “Almost 100 million
exist in abject poverty and extreme
misery.

“How much irresponsibility can V

our societies tolerate.'We have known
for a long time that Latin America has
the worst distribution of wealth in the
world. The income gap that exists
between rich and poor is by far the
widest and most profound on this
planet," he said.

Pointing to statistics that the rich-
est 20 percent of Brazil’s population
earn 32 times more than the poorest
20 percent as an example of income
disparity, Arias encouraged a change
in the state’s role within the econom-
ic market.

“We must free the private sector

He said

FROM PAGE 1

from the chains that have condemned
it to inefficiency,” Arias said. “We
must recognize that it is in our best
interest to allow the private sector to
undertake many of the productive
functions previously monopolized by
the state.” V .

Turning to education, he empha-
sized the direct role it plays on the
development of nations from Third
World status to those of international
decision makers.

“As long as Latin American soci-
eties remain unwilling
to invest substantially in
their peoples’ education,
they will continue to be
plagued by economic
underdevelopment and
social disintegration,”
Arias said. “Today, there
is aconsensus that edu-
cational levels are the
most inﬂuential variable
for the economic pros-
perity of individuals and
nations.

“Through education

we will dispel once and
for all that false belief
that has haunted Latin
America ever since the
early days of our inde-
pendence; namely, that
it is possible to create
republics without first establishing a
culture of liberty andlfreedom,” he
said. “Through education, the words
of demagogues and despots, however
shrewd and tantalizing, will ring
false.”
V Arias‘ lecture, sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh Center for
International Studies and the World
Federalist Association of Pittsburgh, a
global movement working to ensure
peace, took over a year to confirm.

Pitt students who attended the
speech couldn’t have been happier.

Carmen Justiniani, a Pitt law
exchange student from Panama,
agreed strongly with Arias’ position
on the arms trade.

“If we could stop the selling of
the guns everywhere, that would be so
helpful,” she said. “Coming from
Latin American culture where there is
a history of military government, it is
very ideal.”

Doug Masiroff, a Pitt senior
working to receive a certificate from
the University’s Center for Latin
American Studies, thought Arias’
message was right on target. He mir-
rored the sentiments of the small
group of students with whom he stood
talking.

“He said that a more powerful
country has a larger responsibility,”
Masiroff said. “Stemming the ﬂow of
arms is only one way the United
States must get involved.”

goal is to raise $100,000 this year.
If we do that, we'll be the third-

Jen Logan, dance co-chair and a
sister of Kappa Kappa Gamma.

Jessica Pienik, another co-
chair of the Dance Marathon
Committee, said the Greek
Odyssey has ‘a point system for
these fund—raisers to keep the fra-
ternities and sororities motivated
and interested.

In the Dance Marathon, they

fraternities and sororities that

danced the longest and were,

involved in spirit events, such as
the lip sync contest, received the
most points. -

At the end of the year, when
all fund—raiser points are tallied,

recognized at the spring formal
with a trophy.

The Dance Marathon also
serves as a social event.

"This is a bonding experience
for the Greek system," participant
Leigh Stein said.

In the smoke-filled dance

room of Metropol, the 800 stu-
dents danced for eight hours to

‘through the room.

Intermittently, the D.J. inter-
rupted the dancing to give out
prizes.

"We needed to give out incen-
tives to increase involvement,"
Logan said. "We're giving away
everything from CDs to Hibachis
to gift certificates."

She also said the Dance
Marathon Committee gave stu-
dents free pizza, cigarettes and
beer to increase participation.

"There are so many things you
get out of [Dance Marathon] on
top of doing something good,"
Grove said;

Grove said he also believes
the support from the community
and the University in response to
such fund—raisers is greatly appre-
ciated by the Greek system.

Shari Geltzer, an Alpha
Epsilon Phi sister and co-chair of
the Dance Marathon Committee,
said she gets a lot more than mere
satisfaction from having helped
the Children's Hospital.

"It‘s also a way to get my

Internet police crack  
down on term paper
black market

Boston University has begun policing the
Internet for sites that illegally sell term papers. Last
month it charged several companies in federal court
with wire fraud, mail fraud, racketeering, and violat-
ing a Massachusetts law that bans the sale of term
papers. Through an undercover investigator posing
as a desperate college student, the university duped
these companies into selling term papers to her.

This story brings up several tricky issues.

First of all, any student who buys term papers
should be ashamed for being so stupid. Not just too
stupid to write a paper, but so stupid as to actually
pay as much as $175 to buy one while paying thou-
sands more to attend college. '

These poor fools could save a lot of time -and
money if they just bought counterfeit diplomas
instead. You don’t even need an Internet connection
for that — just a laser printer, nice parchment paper.
from Kinkos and Adobe Pagemaker, which would
cost far less than going to school and buying papers.
They could save a lot of money that way and still
obtain worthless pieces of paper that will help them
find jobs they’re not really qualified for and won’t
be able to keep.

Also, there should be laws in every state banning
the sale of term papers, and any school that respects
its alumni should have mandatory expulsion policy
for students who buy them. While most students put
in long hours in libraries and computing labs writing
papers the night before they’re due, it is an abuse of
freedom for others to just buy their grades. That
makes diplomas earned by hard work almost worth-
less too. Nobody can tell later who worked and
earned theirs and who didn’t.

Anybody caught buying term papers should be
immediately ejected and expelled from school.

Perhaps BU has extra time on its hands now
without a football program —— but it’s not Boston
University’s job to police the Internet. It is responsi-
ble for protecting the integrity of the academic insti-
tution, but that doesn’t mean playing undercover
secret agent and trying to entrap small online busi-
nesses.

The key to passing finals: caffeine

Jennifer Stoltz

Columnlst

If you areanything like me, .

you’re counting the days until
Thanksgiving break. We haven’t
had more than a weekend off
since Labor Day, and frankly, I
can’t wait. But, after we all
come back from good 01’ Turkey
Day, and we’re so sick of that

particular poultry that we want

to scream, we can focus our anx-
ieties on a much more worthy
dilemma: dum da dum dum 
ﬁnals.

That exciting time of year
when we college students
become wound so tightly that
you can’t unscrew us from the
ceiling looms ominously around
the comer. Any and all nervous
habits are exacerbated by this
nail-biting time of year. I have
been thinking long and hard
about what one can do to allevi-
ate the pressure and pain of
ﬁnals week and still have a
seemingly favorable outcome

— when the illustrious grade report

comes.

I Numero uno, the ultimate
ﬁnals staple; caffeine. My
blood—vessel-constricting choice
is coffee, like many fellow stu-
dents. However, plain old pop
(yes, pop, not cola, not soda)
will do. Those brave (or desper-
ate) ﬁnal goers in search of the
eternal, yet legal, buzz can uti-
lize Jolt in the same manner.
What is the benefit of this?
Obviously, you need some way
to keep your lids from slamming
shut in the wee hours of the
morning. And, for a short
amount of time, it may help you
mask the fact that the number of

hours you have spent sleeping in
the past week can be counted on

one hand  with fingers left

over.

Second, DO NOT, under
any circumstances, turn on the
TV while attempting to study.
This may seem extremely obvi-
ous. I have been known to chan-
nel-surf while studying without
any negative repercussions. But,
I have to admit, when I have had
it up to here with a given subject,
even Charmel 2 (the one that

resembles TV guide) becomes,

rather captivating. That would
be an interesting one to explain

— “Uh, Mom, Dad, I know my -

grades are not what you would
have liked, but you see, there
was a Power Rangers marathon
on the night before the test 
No, I didn’t watch it, just the
previews on the information
charmel. So, you see, it’s not my
fault at all.” _ -
Also, as I was told in my
advising session, “Plan your
work and work your plan.” I
suggest a “ﬁnals study sched-
ule,” allowing for the all-impor-
tant late-night caffeine runs to 7-
Eleven. In addition, it may be
helpful to form a study group or
have at least one study partner to
help you through this tumul-
tuous time. However, there are a
few guidelines you should_fol-
low carefully when selecting the
people for this “support system.”
First of all, best friends and
your boyfriend/girlfriend are
automatically disqualified.
Every one knows, that even with
the best of, intentions, absolutely
no studying will get done in that
atmosphere. Last year during
our last week of high school, my

THE PITT NEWS

best friend and I spent the time
that was meant for studying sta-
tistics playing Pittopoly. (You

know, that Monopoly spoof
where you get sent to the dean’s,

ofﬁce instead of jail, and the
Cathedral is equated to Park
Place?) You get the idea.

Next, you want to eliminate
anyone who is physically sick.
Catching a cold or the ﬂu cer-
tainly will not enhance your
ability to comprehend anything.
However, you can disregard this
rule if you are the escapist type
and would like to somehow
weasel your way out of the tests.
As we all know, though, this is
not usually a successful pro-
gram. But, we also all know how
bleak the situation can get, so do
whatever ﬂoats your boat.

But once you have planned
a suitable schedule, locked up
your TV, found study-stimulat-
ing cramming partners and
stocked up on java, you will be
well prepared for ﬁnals week.
However, I would like to point
out that no matter how closely
you follow these rules, no results
are guaranteed. Unfortunately,
going to class has to factor in
somewhere. (Just when you
thought you were safe, huh?)
But, above all, just relax and
take deep breaths. We don’t
want to have to force Western
Psych to set aside a wing just for
us. So just put it all in perspec-
tive. Just think, next semester,
12-18 more credits of stress
await you! !! ll

Politicians’ private lives should be just that: private

Michael Berquist
Columnist

A few weeks ago, one of my
more conservative counterparts
here at The Pitt News wrote a col-
umn criticizing President Clinton.
Ordinarily, I don’t like to respond
direcﬂy to columns, but I believe
this column to be ﬁlled with half-
truths and faulty information. I
feel it is my duty to set the record
straight.

After doing the requisite

grousing about President Clinton

being a “liberal,” the author
began her colurrm with an attack
on President Clinton’s war
record: “I am ashamed to have a
man run our country who would-
n’t even ﬁght for it.”

'I'hat’s good to know. I guess
the author is also ashamed of
President Reagan, who spent
World War II living in his comfy
Hollywood home making train-
ing movies instead of volunteer-
ing for combat duty. Also, I sup-
pose the author is similarly
ashamed of the following
Republican candidates for presi-
dent who either. dodged the
Vietnam War draft or went to
extraordinary lengths to avoid
serving: Pat Buchanan, George
Will, Clarence Thomas, Phil
Grarnm, Jack Kemp, Newt

Gingrich and Dan Quayle. What
makes the transgressions of each
of these men far more tenible
than the president’s is that while

squeaky-clean, law-abiding guys
is laughable. This is the same
party that cynically killed the

In our judicial system, the

simple — they aren’t guilty.
Listening to all of the
Republicans whining about
Whitewater has reminded me of
something Shakespeare wrote: “It
is a tale told by an idiot, full of
sound and fury and signifying
nothing.” . Unforttmately the
Republicans cannot bring them-

 

selves to admit their mistake. I
was reading recently that the
Whitewater investigation has thus
far cost taxpayers $35 million.
Thirty-ﬁve million of your hard-
earned dollars have been wasted
because Republicans cannot
bring themselves — to admit that
they were wrong.

I grow weary of ﬁnger-point-
ing and name-calling about
“trustworthiness”. Whatever hap-
pened to issues? Whatever hap-
pened to ideas? The media today
spends so much time examining
the president’s personal life and
speculating about whether or not
he wears boxers or briefs that they
almost never discuss his pro-
grams or his ideas. The news
media today are useless —— 30
minutes of sound bites and gossip
more suited for “A Current
Affair" ’ than educating the public.
Thomas Jefferson once wrote:
“None of us, no one of us, are per-
fect. Were we to love none who
have imperfections, this world
would be a desert for our love.”
What we need is to stop obsessing
about the ‘personal lives of our
leaders and concentrate on what
they stand for.

Michael Berquist thinks that the
personal lives of our leaders are
none of our business.

Cutting welfare
would hurt the
nation's economy

, According to [Pitt News colum-
nist] Carrie Hager, countries that glee-
fully apply the death penalty are mod-
els that work, and Wisconsin’s welfare
reform is too. Once again, she conve-
niently overlooks what her ideas mean
in real human terms. Her claim that
ex-welfare recipients are doing just
fine cannot be based on more than a
few isolated and much—publicized
cases because Gov. Thompson vetoed
legislation to track recipients after
they left welfare. No one knows what
percentage of those people thrown off
welfare actually found jobs, but we do
know that Mi1waukee’s homeless
shelters have reported a 30-percent
increase in the homeless population.
Hager’s own suggestions reveal
the utter bankruptcy of her assertion
that people stay on welfare only out of
laziness —— she suggests donating
money to food banks to “help feed
those who don’t earn enough to pay
for food.” You mean it’s possible to
work hard and still live in poverty?

The growing number of people

don’t tend to share glowing satisfac-

market chaos has been accompanied
by mass layoffs -— 10,000 jobs cut at
Kodak, 2,900 at Fruit of the Loom,
6,395 at Levi Strauss, and 7,500 at
Citicorp. Most of these people will
find other jobs, but ones that pay less
and lack decent benefits. Having to
work harder and harder for less does-
n’t fill you with pride, it makes you
angry. Hager would prefer that people

Encourage TAs,
clon't chide them

This letter is concerning the column
“You shouldn’t be teaching if you can’t
speak the language.” I must take exception
with Dan Ertinan’s views on teaching assis-
tants. Here are my thoughts regarding each
of his three main points:

(1) “There should be a ﬂuency test for
TAs” —-— Regarding ﬂuency, I agree that
TAs should be fairly proﬁcient in the
English language. However, I feel that Mr.
Ertman was far too harsh on this point. I
currently have an Asian TA in one class,
and although she occasionally “butchers”
certain grammatical riﬂes, her vocabulary is
so vastly superior to 75 percent of the cam-
pus, I can hardly fault her for sometimes
using the incorrect verb tense. Furthermore,
she is obviously trying very hard and I do
not see why the student body is so unwill-
ing to encourage people like her. Most

Americans never even come close to that
level of ﬂuency in another language. I give
these people a lot of credit just for the

attempt. English is, as everybody knows, —

the language with the most exceptions.

(2) “The TA should know the material per-
fectly” —— Perhaps Mr. Ertman always had
spectacular professors and teachers in his
educational career. However, I am sure that
most students would agree with me that
even ﬁill professors occasionally cannot
answer a question or solve a problem the
very first time they look at it. It is unrea-
sonable to expect a TA, who has not ﬁn-
ished his education yet, to be able to answer
any question about anything related to a
particular subject. And if someone is so
“easily persuaded” to stop attending recita-
tion sections, I don’t see why the fact that it
contributes to his grade isn’t enough incen-
tive on its own. We are here to learn, not be
entertained.

(3) “The TA should be on time and have
time for students” —— I agree that a TA
should always be on time for classes. But
Mr. Ertrnan seems to be brushing aside the
fact that students are almost always the cul-
prits when it comes to being late.

Maybe Mr. Ertman should put the
responsibility for learning where it belongs
—— on the student.

Dad says
don ’t bail on
Pitt football

I remember it so clearly. My high
school field hockey team was down 4-
0 to our conference rivals with four
minutes left in“ the game. My team-
mates were already teary—eyed and
pouting that, once again, we couldn’t
pull off a win against the Falcons. But
for some reason I kept thinking about
what my father told me before every
game I played.

“Keep your head up, Rach. Don’t
give up until that ﬁnal second runs out
on the clock.”

I think about it now and realize
how appropriately those statements suit
the past two games the Pitt football
team has played. A

I And has lost. In the ﬁnal two min-
utes of play. While watching its
chances of a going to a bowl game fade
into the Pittsburgh sunset.

I want to tease our readership and '

say that yes, there’s a-Pittsburgh team
that has an outstanding chance of going
to a bowl game this year. But before
you make those ﬂight arrangements to
Memphis, I’ll tell you right now, it’s not
us.

At least, not right now. But if we

keep our hopes up, there just might be

two bowl-bound teams.

The Duquesne Dukes are awaiting
a bid to the ECAC Bowl at Georgetown
University next weekend for the brag-
ging rights to the ECAC championship.
Big deal, right? _

What do the Panthers have to brag
about right now? That they played their
best 117 minutes of football in the past
120? _

I won’t beat up on the football team
in print; instead I will focus on my orig-
inal intention: to reiterate the fact that

we can’t give up until the season is all i

over, until the final second of the game
runs out on the big clock at
Mountaineer Field on Nov. 28.

Two games. That’s all we need to
stay in this thing.

One thing to appreciate is that
within the beauty of the Big East, crazy
things have happened this season. Pitt
can beat Miami, whereas Miami can
give a Temple a good ass whippin’, and
Temple can upset (I mean that in the
loosest sense possible) Boston College
and Pitt, while B.C. can turn right
around and smack the pants off West
Virginia.

Last-minute catch by
Spotwood gives
Syracuse 32-27 win

Robert J. Kidwell

Staff Writer

With the Christmas season fast
approaching, it is important to remember it
is always better to give than to receive.

The Pitt Panthers remembered this
Saturday. They were generous enough to
give Syracuse a 19-0 head start in
Saturday’s contest at Pitt Stadium, before
rolling off all of their 27 points in the fourth
quarter. Pitt also gave the nationally-ranked
Orangemen the damp, snow-saturated turf
of Pitt Stadium. And in the end, the Orange
received a 32-27 heartbreaker of a loss.

Syracuse began the scoring in the ﬁrst
quarter when tailback Dee Brown, a substi-
tute for the injured Kyle McIntosh, baneled
through Pitt’s defense for a one-yard score.

This capped off a l6-play, 81-yard
drive for the Orangemen that gobbled up
8:13 off the clock After a botched extra-
point attempt, Syracuse took a 6-0 lead

Pitt went three and out on its next pos-
session, and Syracuse took over on its own
47. On its ﬁrst play, Orange quarterback
Donovan McNabb faked the option to his

left and threw a 51-yard strike down the
middle ﬁeld to an open Jim Turner.

Two plays later, Brown crossed the
plane of the end zone from three yards out
for his second score. The Orangemen were
unsuccessful at a two-point try and took a
12-0 lead into the second quarter.

After both offenses sputtered through

much of the second, Syracuse regained I

control on the shoulders of Brown. The
workhorseof the afternoon saw the ball
ﬁve times on a 10-play drive as Syracuse
marched 60 yards to paydirt. The drive was
capped by a McNabb touchdown pass to
Kaseern Sinceno for a three-yard score.

McNabb’s drive spoils Pitt’s victory party

For Pitt fans, it was won-
derland. A winter one, at that

VV1th 2:12 left, a frigid
Panther faithful watched Billy
West duck under an onrushing
Syracuse defense and into the
end zone. The score lifted Pitt to
a 27-26 lead, which stuck after
a Pete Gonzalez two-point con-
version pass was denied by the
left arm of Orangemen safety

A Jason Poles.

The snow fell slowly, as
the Carrier Dome-bred
Orangemen attempted to adjust
to dropping temperatures and
an inspired Panther defense —
one that held the Syracuse
offense scoreless for the entire
second half.

Fans cheered.

Players purnpedtheirarms.

For all involved with Pitt
football, it seemed too good to

be true.

Turns out, it was.

On a drive that will more
than likely kill the Panthers’
oxygen-mask-wearing bowl
hopes, the Syracuse
Orangemen proved to the few
thousand fans/popsicles left in
Pitt Stadium why they deserved
their national ranking. Donovan
McNabb restarted the sputter-
ing offensive unit, marshaling
an eight-play, 64-yard drive to
glory, not to mention a touch-
down and a 32-27 victory.

Itwasthesecondtimeinas
many games that Pitt’s opposi-
tion won the contest on its last
possession. Pete Gonzalezimay
have summed it up best: “I need
to see a heart doctor. Two
weeks in a row. I don’t know if
I can deal with this.”

Play one of the ﬁnal
Orange drive was routine:
McNabb handed off to
Syracuse tailback Dee Brown,

who carried for 160 yards on 35
rushes in the ﬁrst three quarters.
It was Brown who had ﬁlled in
for Syracuse starter Kyle
McIntosh after just one play. It
was Brown who had carried the
oﬂ’ense to three ﬁrst—half scores,
hitting pay dirt twice himself.

And it was Brown who got
drilled by a charging Julian
Graham and who got dropped
after picking up only one yard.
Graham slipped oﬁ his block
on the outside of the Syracuse
formation, then slanted in and
planted, Brown before he could
escape the line of scrimmage.

His play was typical of. the
Panther defense (the “defense
played hard all day,” Pitt Head
Coach Walt Harris said), espe-
cially in the fourth quarter,
when Brown was held to nega-
tive yardage.

So, on second-and—nine,
McNabb abandoned the run-
ning game and went to a shot-

gun fonnation.This measure
had been effective on third
downs throughout the‘ ﬁrst half,
holding Syracuse atan over-50-
percent conversion rate for
much of the game.

This time, though, the for-
mation failed him. McNabb
ﬁred in the general direction of

' receiver Jim Tlrmer, but his pass

sailedover everyone in sight
and bounced off the slick Pitt
Stadium turf.

Syracuse faced a third-and—nine

and a 20—degree wind-chill fac-

tor. Back in the shotgun,
McNabb found his target to
keep the drive alive with a 17-
yard strike to Quinton
Spotwood. Chuck Brown came
through and made the tackle.
On the ensuing ﬁrst-down
play, McNabb ﬁred incomplete.
He scrambled out of the shot-

THE PITT NEWS

Women win second exhibition,

Jeff Cumpson

Staff Writer

The University of
Pittsburgh women’s basketball
team defeated the Ohio All-
Stars (84-67) on Saturday at
Fitzgerald Field House. It was
the team’s final exhibition
game in preparation for its sea-
son opener on Nov. 21 against
Robert Morris College.

The Ohio All-Stars, a trav-
eling team composed of former
college players, could not con-
tend with the Lady Panthers’
depth. Only seven players
scored for the All-Stars, as
compared to 15 for Coach Kirk
Bruce’s Lady Panthers.

“We’ve looked at their past
box scores, and sometimes
they only have seven or eight
players; these young ladies
have other jobs,” Coach Bruce

said of the All-Stars. “But, we

knew whoever they would
send would be seasoned veter-
ans who can play.”

Coach Bruce’s prediction
was correct as two All-Stars
had the game’s two outstand-
ing individual performances.

Joani Mazzola-O’Connor
recorded game—highs by tally-
ing 23 points and four blocks,
and Angela Drake scored 22
points while adding eight
rebounds.

Pittsburgh, coming off a
loss to the Latvian National
Team, countered the strong
inside presence of Mazzola-
O’Connor and Drake with a
steady stream of fresh players;
thereby rounding out its exhi-
bition record at 1-1.

The Lady Panthers were
led by forward Rasheeda
Akram, who scored 14 points
and handed out three assists in
only 19 minutes of playing
time.

“She’s a freshman .who’s
got a lot of talent,” Coach
Bruce said. “She got a couple
steals and got in the ﬂow of the
game .. we’re counting on
her.”

Forward Latia Howard and
center Farrah Woods con-
tributed to Pittsburgh’s 44-37
out-rebounding of the All-
Stars by pulling down five
rebounds each. Howard was

score 85 points on Ohio All-Stars

also the Lady Panthers’ sec-
ond-leading scorer with 11
points.

Despite these statistics,
Pitt’s offensive catalysts for
Pittsburgh were guards
LaTonya Blanton and Monique
Toney. The two split time run-
ning the offense, and they
combined for 12 points and 12
assists, while committing only
three turnovers.

“Anytime you look at that
statistic and it’s high on the
assist side, as a head coach,
you’re happy,” said Coach
Bruce. “They both handle the
ball very well, and find their
teammates first.”

As a team, the Lady
Panthers shot 35-73 (.479)
from the ﬂoor, including an
18-34 (.529) second half.
Pittsburgh also shot the ball
well from the free throw line in
the second half, connecting on
nine of 12 en route to an 11-
for-17 performance.

Pitt gave a respectable per-
formance overall, and a good
thing to go into the season
with. Coming off a year that

Taylor, Finneman out for men's
season opener versus Bucknell

Zachariah Blott
News Edltor

Injury has visited Pitt’s basketball
team once again.

Freshman guard John Finneman
underwent knee surgery on Friday, and
sophomore guard Kelli Taylor has sus-
tained a foot injury, leaving him in a
“walking cast,” according to Pitt
Assistant Coach Troy Weaver.

These two injuries come less than
two weeks after teammate Kevin
Leslie, a 6-foot—8 power forward,
hyperextended his knee in a practice,
keeping him off the court for four to
six weeks.

Taylor, one of two starters retum—
ing from last season, hurt his right foot
in Friday’s practice, Weaver said. The
coach added that “it hasn’t been deter-
mined yet” how long Taylor will have
to sit out.

Some spectators at Pitt’.s football
game against Syracuse Saturday said
they saw Taylor walking without
crutches at the game but that he was in
a cast.

One spectator said Taylor told him
his foot is broken and that he will be
out “four weeks, maybe more.”
Another spectator said Taylor reports

he will not play for “five or six
weeks.”

Taylor ranked first in the Big East
last season with 3.2 steals per game. In
addition, his 9.6 points per contest
were the third-highest on the team.

This is not the first time Taylor has
been injured. During the 1995-96 sea-
son, he was sidelined most of the sea-
son with a back injury after playing in
one game for 14 minutes. He received
a medical redshirt for the season.

Finneman had his knee cleaned
out by surgeons on Friday, according
to Weaver. Weaver did not know how
long the 6—foot-6 shooter would be out.

Finneman tore his anterior cruci-
ate ligarnent prior to his senior season
at W.T. Woodson High School in
Fairfax, Va. He did not play that sea-
son.
In October, Head Coach Ralph
Willard said Finneman has been tenta-
tive at times in pushing himself physi-
cally.

“He’s not quite sure what he can
do with it,” said Willard last month.

The Panthers’ first game is
Monday night against Bucknell.
Without Taylor, Finneman or Leslie,
Pitt will be suiting up only seven
scholarship players for the contest.

Do you understand what I’m getting
at? Or am I just rambling?

What does all of this Big East com-
motion say to me? It says a hell of a lot. It
says:

1. We can’t let a bunch of thugs from

2. We can’t let Temple spoil our turn

3. We still have a ﬁghting chance at

Only if we keep our heads up.

I look down toward the end of the sta-
dium and I see those big yellow letters
screaming at me: “NINE TIME
NATIONAL CHAMPIONS!”

Then I pause and think about about all
this Panther Pride and ask myself: Did
those national ‘champions ever give up?

Did I ever give up?

To give up on our football team now
would be like giving up on Rocky before
the end of the movie. We the school, the
student body, the fans and The Pitt News
can’t let the season go to ruins without a
struggle until the end. So, support your
football team. Don’t cast it off. Don’t let
the players let you down.

Do this, and I’m sure you will all
make Ray Lenzi very proud.

a ﬁrst down and momentum. On the next play, Pitt
would get its revenge.

Earlier in the quarter, Syracuse wideout/kick
returner Kevin Johnson raced untouched for a 91-yard
kick-retum touchdown. Now, he was in on offense in a
three-wideout set and caught a short pass from McNabb
for eight yards.

Instead of running untouched, Johnson promptly
met the shoulder of Pitt safety Curtis McGhee, whose
vicious tackle appeared to almost separate Johr1son’s
head ﬁom the rest of his body.

After the play, Johnson got up. Chuck Brown,
though, didn’t. While running with Spotwood, Brown
suffered a leg injury. Hank Poteat replaced him at cor-
nerback for play eight.

On the last play of the drive, McNabb’ threw a
ﬂoater toward Spotwood along the left sideline. Poteat,
fresh from the bench, was beaten by half a step. The
Syracuse wideout ran under the pass, catching it with lit-
tle real estate left in the end zone for the game-winning
touchdown.

“It was a great throw. It was a spot throw,” Harris
said. “When they had to get it done, they were able to
get it done.”

Replays would show that the spot Spotwood ran to
may have been just a shade out of bounds. Hanis
refused to question the call directly but did say that “[the
loss] was real sad. If it was not a touchdown, then it
would be even sadder.”

Donovan McNabb led his offense to 324 yards in the first half alone.

 PROM PAGE 7

The Orangemen went into the half with
a commanding 19-0 lead. Syracuse had 324
total yard to Pitt’s 77. It was a lopsided
matchup by anyone’s standards. But, there
was still a half-hour of football left.

On Pitt’s second possession of the sec-
ond half—hour, the Panthers faced a fourth-
and—one on their own 35. With a 19-point
deﬁcit in front of them and the noise of the
Pitt student section at their backs, Coach
Walt Harris decided to go for it.

“I wasn’t trying to be a hero, just want-
ed to give the ‘D’ some hope,” said Harris.

Gonzalez sneaked for the ﬁrst down,
but just three plays later, the Panthers were
forced to punt from the Pitt 43.

Punter Grant Cofﬁeld received the snap
and threw the ball downﬁeld to wide-open
linebacker Ernest Coakley for a 25-yard
gain and a ﬁrst down on the SU 38.

“All week it [the fake punt] was there.
It gave us a spark when we really needed it,”
said Hanis.

The team fed oil“ that spark and cashed
in when Gonzalez threw a ﬁve-yard touch-
down pass to Jake Hoifart. Gonzalez took
the two-point conversion in himself to cut
the score to 19-8.

But the thought of a comeback nearly
vanished when Sy1acuse’s Kevin Johnson
struck, returning Coﬁield’s ensuing kickoff
91 yards for a touchdown.

“The kick retum was momentous. We
have struggled in special teams,” Harris
said. “Grant did a good job all day, he just
didn’t kick it deep enough.”

Gonzalez responded with a 28-yard
touchdown pass to wideout Terry Murphy,
cutting the deﬁcit to 11.

This is where the Pitt “D” found its
“hope.” It held the varmted Syracuse offense
to three plays and out on an abortive Orange
drive, highlighted by an Eric Kasperowicz
sack of McNabb.

“We made some big plays. We wanted
to give the offense a chance,” said
Kasperowicz.

The offense took the chance it was
given, and when Billy West scored midway
through the fourth, the score went to 26-21.

After another defensive stop, Pitt found
itself at its own six with just over three min-
utes remaining. The Panthers needed 94
yards to take the lead.

Gonzalez began the drive with two runs
totaling 17 yards. Then he went deep to a
well-covered Terry Murphy, who made a
miraculous catch for a 41-yard gain. The
quarterback threw for a quick ﬁrst down
before hitting fullback Tony Thompson at
the SU 1-yand-line. West plowed in for a
another touchdown to give Pitt a 27-26 lead.

But, the drive went for naught.
McNabb would lead the Orange on an
eight-play, 65-yard drive of his own, ending
with a touchdown pass to Quinton
Spotwood that secured the win for Syracuse.

“There were a couple teams battling out
there today,” said Harris. “I give a tremen-
dous amount of credit to our defense who

played hard all day. I’m proud to be associ- ‘

ated with all of them.”

Are you interested in  
Consider 

Linguistics is the science of language. Course offerings for Spring 1997
include the following:

LING 0080 Aspects of language
Text: Steven Pinker’s bestseller, The Language Instinct. Fulfills Social Science
and Public Policy Issues GE requirements. No prerequisite.

Language is at the center of human existence. The activities that ﬁll our days -
politics and romance, business and education, entertainment and warfare -
require the uniquely human ability to use and understand language. We all have
questions about the nature of this ability. How is language mastered and used?
Can animals learn it? What about computers? Are some languages better than
others? How does the language we learn affect how we think? This course
addresses these questions.

LING I 930 Introduction to Applied Linguistics

Thinking of graduate school in language education or foreign languages, or of
teaching English overseas? Try learning about language teaching, language and
the law, language writing systems, and stylistics in Applied Linguistics.
Prerequisite: LING 0080, LING 1950, or study of a foreign language. Contact
iul’fs+@pitt.edu for further details.

LING I 950 Introduction to Linguistics

A survey of general linguistics, focussing on the structure of human language:
its sounds, word structures, and syntax. Gain an appreciation for the wonders of
human language, the variety and complexity of its structure, and the subtlety of
its use. No prerequisite.

LING I 951 Languages of the World

This course is organized around two central questions: (1) How do languages
differ from one another? (2) What are some social and political consequences
of language contact? Each student will select one language family to investigate
through a series of weekly assignments. No prerequisite. Contact

sally@isp.pitt.eidu for more information.

Questions? Contact the Department of Linguistics at 624-5916 or 624-5900.
