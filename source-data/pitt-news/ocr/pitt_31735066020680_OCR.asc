of deafness,” she said. Karen's deaf-
ness is a result of being ‘born two
months premature. V .
She was around five years old
when her family realized that she
was deaf and not retarded. As she
got older, around eightoyears old,
she went to a school for the deaf. It

was there that she and the other stu- ‘

dents realized they were different
from others. But she said that it
didn’t affect her because everyone

. was the same there; they were all

deaf. ,

“When I was a teenager, that’s
when it got tough,” she said. “People
couldn’t understand me and didn’t
want to accept me. Even the teachers
didn’t know how to react to me.”

It was tough for her but she stayed
in the public schools and "eventually
went on to be actively involved in
high school. “It took a couple of

years for things to get better,” she ,

said..“But once they [students and
teachers] realized that I wasn’t going
to put up with’ being left out, they
started to accept me and I knew I
was going to make it.”

’ Karen had to prove herself all
over again to get into the University
of Pittsburgh. “I got ‘into CM U,”she
said, “but I didn't get into Pitt. 1
went to see why I hadn't been
accepted and it turned’ out to be

because I was deaf. They told me-

that every deaf person ever enrolled
at the university had flunked out.
They eventually.took me and on gra-
duation day I showed them that a
deaf person could make it through.”

Speaking had been very, difficult
for Karen as a teenager. She would
only speak to those who could
understand her well, her four or five
close friends and her family.-“It’s the

Posvar reveals

Pitt’s 5—year plan

By Michael Fay and
Kathy Campbell
The Pitt News

Yesterday, President Wesley Pos-

var announced a proposal that’

would phase out the School of Phar-
macy at the University of Pitts-
burgh. The proposal stems from
suggestions made by the university’s
Faculty Task Force on Planning.

In an effort to explain the recent
cut and, in general, the preliminary
recommendations of the five-year
University Plan, President Wesley
Posvar and Provost Roger Ben-
jamin met with the media for brief-
ing, in which general questions were
aired concerning the future of Pitt.
The University Plan began its initial
phase in the spring of 1984. The gen-
eral goals of the plan not only deal
with evaluating and restructuring
‘the university’s organization for aca-
demic administration (its pattern of
schools, colleges and departments),
but also improving the strength and
well-being of the faculty and staff

and assisting Western Pennsylvania
~ economically-. ~ - ~

, “There is a re-emphasis on our
strengths,” began Posvar conc_ern-
ing the philosophy of the university.
“We have a dozen areas of "strength
that bring us national and world
recognition.” The plan includes a
number of increases in areas such as

.computer science, information

science, the University Center’ for
International Studies and the
schools of law and public health.
According to the plan, increases and
decreases in funding and reorganiza-
tion efforts have been suggested

exception and not the rule for a deaf
person to be able to speak,” she said.

Karen went on to be an exception.
“It took. me nine years to learn to
speak,” she said. “I wasn’t able to
talk clearly until I was in college —— I
guess I was around 22 years old.” "

Different techniques are used by

' the deaf when they learn to use their

voice. They range from feeling
someone’s face as they speak to pick-
ing up vibrations to reading lips and
trying to imitate.

“I learned to speak mostly
through mimicking other people,
reading lips and‘ looking into the
mirror to see if I was doing it the way
I watched other people as they
spoke.”

Trial and error seems to be the
method Karen has relied on. “It’s
tough. I still have people correct me
when I saysomething wrong. People

r tells problems of the

across the boardiwith only a few
programs remaining at status quo.

According to a university press
release, the School of Pharmacy will
be phased out in order to reallocate
resources to areas of higher priority.
“Certain questions have been raised
about low productivity and the qual-
ity of research within the school,”
stated Posvar.

The School of Pharmacy is one
of only four in the state of Pennsyl-
vania, and according to The Ameri-
can Council on Pharmaceutical
Education, it is one of the best in the
nation. It received a seven-year
accredidation from the council.

“We refuse to accept the provost’s
judgment on our school,” said Dr.
Randy P. Juhl, chairman of the
Department of Pharmacy Practice,
adding, “We have an outstanding
school of pharmacy, outstanding
faculty and excellent students — 100
percent of our students have jobs
even before taking their exams.”

Juhl also pointed to the school's,

previous. and ongoing accomplish-
ments in combating such problems
as sickle cell anemia. Cyclosporin, a

drug that. helped make organ trans- V

plants successful, was pioneered at
Pitt's School of Pharmacy.

“This will never happen," Juhl
said when asked about the proposed
cut. “Although it [the task force's
action] has already done irreparable
damage, we're not going to roll over
and play dead." He also said that
many of the school’s associates are
“in the political environment" and
the school plans to use those ties.
“The graduates will be appalled at
the university’s decision to cut the
pharmacy program,” he said.

.deaf,

still ask me to repeat myself. I'm still
learning. My latest accomplishment
has been the word ‘preoccupied,’ "
she said. '

Karen wears a hearing aid which

allows her to hear a sound frequency‘

of 1 15 decibels, which translates into
hearing and distinguishing some
sounds but not necessarily making
out words. She must rely on reading
lips and using sign to communicate.

If she takes out her hearing aid,"
‘ though,

she hears absolutely

nothing.

But sometimes nothing is better,

especially when Karen recalls her
hearing aid’s participation on her
first date. “It was my most embar-
rassing moment!” she said.‘ “It was
the end of the evening on ‘my first
date when my date and I-were stand-
ing on the porch. Just as he went to

SGB president

By Louise Marshall
The Pitt News

Student Government Board Pres-

ident Ken Stram plans not only to_

get involved in other activities next
semester as his term comes to an
end, but he would also like to hit the
bars. “I haven’t been to the bars this
semester,” said Stram.

Stram, a senior majoring in politi-
cal science and English writing, is
planning to apply to law school over

'Christmas vacation and check out

some job opportunities.

“I plan on getting involved in
other activities next semester that I
haven't had time for," said Stram.
These activities include an intern-
ship with the Writer's Conference,
Theta Chi Fraternity,_Greek Week
and The Hand-in-Hand Festival.

Looking back on his term as presi-
dent, Stram feels that the Student
Government Board has accom-
plished a great deal. “We took away
the elitist professional attitude and
tried to get students involved in Stu-
dent Government,” he said.

“We formulated the Freshman
Council that all the candidates

E bragged about in the election, estab-

lished a successful student assembly,

I

reflects on his term

and thanks to Pam Hart, we have an
Affirmative Action Committee.”
According to Stram, the Student
Government Board approached the
university administration on three
subjects. The SGB handled the
problem with the internship office at
a senate level to follow through with
what former board member Mindy
Goldberg had done. SGB also had a
lot of inﬂuence with the bus propo-
sal in forming the campus shuttle,
and the board made the administra-
tion aware of student concern about

‘their involvement in South Africa.

“I am proud that we did it before it
became a big issue," thanks to the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee. The administration has to come
around and make a decision and I’m

' glad we had some inﬂuence," said

Stram.

Stram plans to orient the new
board to their new positions so they
know what to expect.

“I'm still going to be around. Stu-
dent government is something I’ve
been actively involved in for two
years and I can't shrug it off like a
sweater. If people need me, I'll be
there for them," said Stram.

Stram advises that the newly-
elected President Luke Kluchko
should make his own decisions and
not to take anything too seriously or
else he will get frustrated. “He
should take things with a grain of

Science
Ph.D.s

(USPS) —— In spite of the recent
increase in the number of students
majoring in computer science, the
number of Ph.D.’s awarded;yearly
in that area has fallen, signalingto
some educators there might be fewer
advances made in computer
research.

Johnette Hassell, associate pro-
fessor and head of the computer
science department. at Tulane Uni-
versity in Louisiana, said the
number of Ph.D.’s given yearly has
fallen from 250 in 1976 ' to an
expected 200 in 1984. The decrease is
caused mainly by students being
lured’ away from graduate school by
industry, Hassel said. The most ca-
pable students are the most heavily
recruited. ' I

Industry is making very- hand-
some ﬁnancial offers to computer
science graduates, she said. Gradu-
ates not only are offered fairly high-
paying jobs in companies, but many
of those companies also will pay for
graduate study for their employees.
Companies may also offer research
opportunities to interested students,
apparently giving them the same
research involvement as graduate
school.

“Students can have their cake and
eat it too," Haskell said. “Theymake

money, do research and go to gradu-
ate school.”

But industrial and academic life ‘

are not the same, Hassell said. In
industry, students learn a very nar-
row kind of research, mostly related
to that _industry’s products, which
must many times be found proﬁta-

ble within a relatively short time, she «
.said. i ‘ '  it

Research in an academic setting is
broader. It can be conducted for its
own sake, allowing research that

A may not be proﬁtable immediately

but that might lead to more proﬁta-
ble research later. tr .

Part of the problem students face
when deciding between graduate

school and jobsin industry is that '

they have not been involved in much

research before graduation -and are -
' not

familiar with the different
aspects of research.

“The brightest students are heav-
ily recruited by a number of indus-
tries,—” Hassell said. “Unless they
have the chance to do research, they
don’t understand it." 

Universities such as Tulane are
now trying to keep students in aca-
demics by involving undergraduate
students in research as early as'possi-
ble. Three students in Tulane's I984
graduating class had already pub-
lished papers based on their research
before graduation, she said.

Academic involvement is pushed '

from early on, Hassell said. Tulane
representatives recruiting freshmen
begin then to talk about research

. _ careers.‘Companies also are helping,

Hassell said. They are encouraging
really good people to stay in aca-
demics, and some are even donating
their own employees with Ph.D.’s to
schools for research and teaching
positions. 2 - t ,
Other ideas such as full-time pur-
suance of doctoral degrees during

the school year supplemented by

summer work in industry are also
being tried. Hassell said other plans
are being considered that would help
industry’ but also keep enough
Ph.D.’s in academicsxto keep com-
putertscience departments strong.

kiss me goodnight, a buzz from my.
hearing aid went of."

According to Karen, the best way
for someone to initially communi-
cate with a deaf person is through
sign, if both people know it. If not,
then writing is the most effective
means for them to use.

Since there are only a limited
number of deaf people who can
speak, trying to communicate with a
deaf person can be frustrating and
awkward. That is why Karen’s goal
is to make people more aware of
deafness. Hopefully, she says that
awareness can close the gap which
exists between the deaf and the hear-
ing. “I like to think of us as a differ-

ent culture,” Karen said. “There are

the Italians, the Irish, the Jews and
there are also the deaf.”

Teaching sign allows Karen to
educate people to communicate with
the deaf. Don Mrdjenovich, a senior
in Sign II, recalls the first day in
Karen’s Sign'I class: “I was sitting
there waiting for class.to begin when
the teacher in the front of the room
started moving her lips as if she were
talking, but no words were coming
out. She then started to move her
hands in sign language. I thought at
first that maybe I was supposed to

‘Isl

understand her. All of a sudden she
paused and looked at us and said,
‘How does it feel?’ ”

This was Karen's way of introduc-
ing the hearing students to the deaf
world. She sees the deaf in an advan-
tageous position because they have
already learned to adapt to a hearing
world and know what they must do
to get by. But she said that the hear-
ing people have never had to go into
the deaf world, so they are lost when
they are in a situation with ‘a deaf
person.

“I think that the hearing people
are the ones with a handicap," she
said. “They have a rough time com-

municating with our [the deaf],

world.”

Since Karen was two years old,
her mother, a dance instructor, has
been giving her lessons. She said that
she is able to pick up the beat of the
music through the vibrations.
According to Karen, it takes a lot of
time and patience to memorize the
timing of each song.

Karen recalls the time following
her coronation as Miss Deaf Pen-
nsylvania in 1983. She performed a
dance routine to the song “Flash-
dance," and people frequently
stated, “I didn't know that you were
able to dance.”

She said that, for the state pag-

'-: rd‘  '

   the -de

cant, she had someone mouthing the
words as she danced, to help‘her
keep time. But she wasn’t permitted
to have that kind of help,-,_.__at.the
national contest. “By the time ‘of the
national pageant, I knew the song so
well that I
anyone," she said. She. added that
with some songs, no matter how
much time she puts in or help she
gets, she just can’t do them.

There is very little that a deaf per-
son can’t do, according to. Karen.
But people's attitude toward them
must change in order for them to
want to try. Karen said that students
in her sign classes try to test her at
first. They _try to take advantage of
her deafness, until she surprises
them by catching them using their
voices when they are not supposed
to, like during a test.

“She doesn’t miss a thing," said
Robin ‘Woods, a sophomore sign
student. “I can remember one time
we were having class in a restaurant
and we were not allowed to use our
voice to communicate, we had'to
rely totally on sign. A girl in the back

‘ corner told her friend in the chair

next to her, ‘We can talk because she
can't hear us anyway.’ Well, Karen
may not have heard what the girl
was saying, but she was able to read
her lips and was on .to her

really didn't need-

urc rut news, ruuuy, nuvcurucr bu, 130-+

immediately.” . *

Karen says that she is able to catc
people cheating by just watching
their actions. “By observing some-»
one’s body language I can tell if they
are cheating or not," she said.

After a few displays of discipline,
Walkney said the students know
there is little they can get away with
and that the number of incidents of
cheating and talking goes down.

Walkney was the originator of the
sign classes at the University of
Pittsburgh, when she was still study-
ing as an undergraduate her junior
year. Since that time, the class’ pop-
ularity has increased _with every
term.

“Every term the classes keep do.u-
bling," she said. “We started with
just about five or six students in one
class. Now we’re up to over I00 stu-
dents this term." One reason she
gives for the increase is that the class

now counts as a language require- ‘

ment at Pitt.

Walkney would like to see the
numbers keep growing. “It‘s impor-
tant for a lot of people to have the
ability to sign. It isn't just for the
deaf and their families. I would like
to see more doctors and nurses learn
it to help them deal with deaf
patients. But even beyond that, sign
can be very helpful to anyone who is

 -

or will  "working with the public,”
she said.

Karen says that one of her goals is -

to create a sign language department
at Pitt. There are already three levels
of sign available to students.

“Karen is a very strong person,” ‘

said Mrdjenovich. He attributes her
strength to the chances she has
taken, like starting the classes and
alsoworking in other organizations.
She created Sign Connection, a stu-
dent activities group, and Beautiful
Hands, a troop. of» performers--who
do songs in sign for the deaf. The
group draws a vivid picture of what
the song means with their hands and
body movement to the music.

The 29-year-old instructor values
the relationships that she has formed

‘with her group members and stu-_

dents. She says that they do as much
for her socially as she does for them
academically. “When we go out pub-
licly, they make sure I know what is
going on. Or when I mispronounce a
word, they help" me say it right," she
said. ‘-

‘‘I‘m not going to say that there is
no difference between the deaf*and
the hearing. There will be some
things I won't be able to do, but

that’s not going to stop me from _

trying." .

Dorm dwellers told to- beware of theft

By Kathleen Kashayi j

The Pitt News

Dormitory residents should pro- ' I

tect their valuables against theft over
winter break, according to Gerald
Kowalski, director of security for
the Office of Residence Life. .

“The University of Pittsburgh
doesn’t take liability for valuable
personal possessions, so we suggest
they take all that stuff home —- TV_,
jewelry, stereo.-

“It might be inconvenient to do
that, but it’s a heck of a lot more

_ /inconvenient to have it stolen. I

would suggest that the things they
_do -leave, they take. an inventory of
before they leave so they can check
the items
Kowalski said.
Students should make this list
with the idea that anything left in the
dormitory can be replaced, sug-

gested Kowalski. “As an example,-

I’d hate to see someone lose their
grandfather’s watch. You couldn’t
buy another one," said Kowalski.

According to Walter V. Waters,
assistant director of Public Safety,
locking room doors does not always
prevent theft.

“I don’t know, how it happened——I
don’t want to blame the housing
authority or the students—there just
seem to be extra room keys ﬂoating

Because of these extra keys,
Waters said, “About money or small
computers, I’d feel much more com-

fortable if the students could take _

/

them home.”
Concerning dormitory thefts over
the winter break, Kowalski said,

“There are always some, unfortu-

nately. That’s why we attempt to

-educate the students. There’s a good

deal of responsibility that lies "with '
the individual student as concerns‘
their property, but we, have the

responsibility to warn them to pro-

tect that property.”

“Successful universities must make choices in order to compete
effectively in this emergingworld," said President Posvar and Provost
Benjamin yesterday when they released the preliminary recommenda-

« tions of the “University of Pittsburgh Plan: 1985-1990.” The prelimi-

nary recommendations, as Posvar explained them, are “highly

competent perceptions of _future needs and opportunities as seen‘

now.” He suggested that the future “will differ much from what we
now expect it to be." ' r

‘ Considering the fact that this university is to experience some
serious departmental and administrative “restructuring" in order to
meet future demands and remain a top-ranked university, one would
assume that the students and faculty to bear the brunt of these changes
are: l) familiar with the administration's goals and plans; 2) aware of

the social, economic and institutional changes facing post-industrial, _‘
societies and the more direct implications of those changes. Do stu- 
dents understand why the university needs restructuring when, as it’

now stands, Pitt remains one of the leading universities in medical and
technological research? '
Chances are they do not. The University of Pittsburgh could be a
very exciting place in years to come if the administration's five-year
plan is thoroughly understood, accepted and approached eagerly by
University of Pittsburgh students. Change can be a very positive and
enlightening process when it is welcomed. -
' The university administration is not adequately taking into account
the direct recipients ofits proposals — the students. Let it be suggested
that projects soon be undertaken to better acquaintstudents with the
future of education, information, technology and industry. It is not

the proper function of administrators to “impose" such changes on '

unknowing constituents. Perhaps some workshops or seminars can be
coordinated to" address the changing role of ,modern educational
institutions. After all, it's our future.  ‘

  I Garbage ln,

Garbage out

There are 10 days left between now and the final exam period.
While many students‘ minds turn toward the rigor of filling the final
week of the term with the form (but not the substance) of the past l4
weeks, our minds turn toward money. ,

The only thing in the world better than an easy bit of cash is a free bit
of cash. That's what makes gambling such a lucrative activity — toss a
die, win a dollar; pull a lever, win a dollar; call a card, win a dollar. No
tears, no pain, no sweat. Great! And work can be such a tiresome
thing: up at 7:30, a piece of toast, splash, shave, brush, rush and off
you go to face the world of conﬂict, until you're home again at last to
rest. Flick on the TV and feel your stomach’s muscles wring and twist

when the little old lady with blue hair pulls four numbered ping-pong .

bails out of a glass box, none of them the right one.
Someday, you think, I'll win the lottery and _I'll,never have to work
again. Think of all the things you could buyrwith $5 or $6 million: a

fast _and beautiful car, a house on Craig Street and expensive clothes. _ '

You'd never have to work another day in your life.

What a lovely thing it is to have a dream. It's what keeps the
working man going. There's always the dream. Such a pleasure to
think that you'll someday be someone who's somewhere, that it isn't
all for nothing. - ~-

lt's sometimes sad, but the mind always seems to snap back to
reality and sting the side of the._head like a shot rubber band. Fewer

than I percent of all men ever win the lottery or make a killing at the‘

dice table. Most people never make a killing of any kind and kill
themselves instead.

, We're born naked and we die naked, and there's nothing we can do
to alter the fact, so why spend all the time in between buying clothes?
There's a lot more in the multicolored universe than just green money,
and grades are nothing more than academic currency. Even if a college
education could guarantee a job (it cannot) to its recipient, the money
or prestige resultant of that job could not guarantee happiness. To

' throw away the only non-renewableresource — time — on a delusion

is pushing chance beyond its reasonable bounds.

  Letters to the Editor

Competent Cops

Having read the same article
about the-University of Pittsburgh
Police (The Pitt News, Nov. 2), mv
response is somewhat different from
that of Mr. Joseph Forbes (Nov. I9)
and Clay O'Da1ey (Nov. 21).

I feel safer attending Pitt because
of the campus police. The_campus is
not located in a relatively crime-free
area — it is in Oakland, an areaiwith
an earned reputation for a high
crime rate. Withthe number of stu-
dents here, the campus and its prop-
erties make easy targets‘ for
criminals; the Pittsburgh police
could never adequately protect the
students and properties of the uni-
versity unless they formed a station
specifically for the campus.

Mr. Forbes‘ assertion about ~

duplication of law enforcement

. efforts between the state police and

campus police is not wholly sound.
True, the campus police can go any-
where in the commonwealth to
make an arrest. They could even go
to California. So could the Shaler
police, or the city police, or the state

. police, but only in pursuit of a felon

who is suspected of committing a
crime within the department's
jurisdiction.

This is because the Pitt police _
department operates under the same -

strict laws that the Pittsburgh police
do. Though it_is a part of Pitt's pub-
lic safety department, it has full law
‘enforcement capabilities and
responsibilities. And it is not the
fully separate, Omnipotent, uncon-
trolled force that Mr. Forbes is sug-
gesting it is. More controls are
placed on the university's patrol
officers than most municipal"
departments. '

At Pitt, there is never a time when

a shift commander is not monitoring
all patrols. The Nov. 2 article stated
this. The same constant supervision
is not always present in municipal

Mr. Clay O'Daley's statement
about psychological screenings not
being necessary for. Pitt police is
true. But only so far as it leaves out
all of the truth. Only the city police
require such screening; the state
does not, nor do most municipal
departments.‘This is a matter of
individual department policy.

And Mr. O'Daley seemed to have
read only part of the Nov. 2 article.
He" said, “I,‘m«also amazed that only

. felonies  could keep [an applicant]

   

from being. hired for the campus
police ...” But did. he read the next
paragraph? James Watters, assistant
director of administration of the

public safety department, stated,
“We do a complete background

investigation. What they have done

in the past is the best indication of
what they will do in the future." That
means any past misdemeanors will
be under close scrutiny — no one
will be hired who cannot be trusted.
In addition, applicants must go
through three interviews ‘before
being hired. Anyone unsuitable for
the job will be screened out during
those.

And as for making the criminal
records of the campus police officers

. public, should we demand that crim-

inal records of people who advocate
limiting Pitt police’s protective pow-‘
ers be made public also?

Perhaps if I had had negative __

. experiences with the campus police, ‘

I would feel differently about their ,
presence and powers. But I have
never been arrested and I feel only
those who have, or have had cause to
hide something from the law could

be so eagerto have the university
V police’s proverbial arms handcuffed.

Felicia Chmelovsky
CAS ‘85

Tight Ship

I've noticed in the past few weeks
all of the negative articles about the
campus police, who by the way are
educated, must go to college and
also attend the Allegheny Police

_ . Academy. '
Director Tucker runs a tight ship

in case you didn't know that. The '

men call o'ut for "those coffee and
lunch breaks, and it is all logged in at
their desk. Only two patrolmen and
one car man can take a break at one
time.

Maybe this article in “Sights and
Sounds" from Eye and Ear Hospital
will give you a little more insight into
all of the aspects of campus police
work. - -

by ‘Jeffrey Sewald

Combining thetalents of Robert
'— 'De‘Niro and Meryl Streep would usu-
' ally elicit feelings of excitement and
anticipation for those who appreciate
fine acting and superb films. You may
_as well take solace in the fine acting
' because Falling in Love offers little_ in
the way of impressive cinema and
even less in the way of insight into
the desperate lives of its characters.
Set in the bustling midst of Man-
hattan, the film is, quite simply, a love
story between two Westchester
County commuters who take the
train into the cityeveryday from the
suburbs. Frank Raftis and Molly Gil-
more, an architectural engineer and a
graphic artist, respectively (doesn't
anyone have a real job anymore?),
meet, by chance at Rizzoli Books on
Fifth. Avenue during the Christmas
rush. It is there that their fascination
"with each other begins. Only one
major obstacle exists for each. They
are both "very married.”

I Throughout the film we are blud-
geoned with the reality of both Frank
and Molly's marital status until _it
becomes tiresome,.either by the mere
fact that it is constantly made a point

/ of or because we have become so
jaded by the times that we feel like
. suggesting that they have their
stupid little affair and be done with it.
Such were the observed reactions
from much of the audience.
Playwright Michael Cristofer, who
already packs impressive credentials
with both a Tony and a Pulitzer for

his drama The Shadow Box, makes his

screenwriting debut with this film.
But Falling in Love just doesn't work.
Not as a film. I found myself nodding
off in the theater for the first time

' since Star Trek, the movie. Frightening
is the prospect of what may have hap-
pened had the film not secured such
high—powered talent with enormous
box-office appeal. _

One of the main problems is the
parallel development of each charac-
ter's feeling toward_infidelity. They
obviously a7en’t operating from the

‘same backgrounds or on the same set
of assumptions, not to mention

degrees of reservation, but we do_

witness their indiscretions, however
systematically, with DeNiro’s charac-
ter, the male of course, falling prey to
his hormones before she does. Play-
ing recognition games with the sites
of New York was far more interest-
ing than anything that was happen-
ing to the characters. And that is a

serious problem.

While true stories of friendship and
love are generally inspirational,‘this
particular tale relies so much on hap-
penstance that it becomes annoying.
But probably its major shortcoming is
the poor character development with
respect to each of the lead characters’
spouses. A . '

It would appear that these people
are. integrally involved in the‘pl'ot as

well as defining the scope of the
entire situation. What is put forth is
the sheer boredom of their relation-
ships and little else. Molly's husband,
admirably played by David Clennon,
comes off as cold, though we do know
that he is a doctor as he speaks of
losing a patient, which visibly upsets
him. How can we be ‘expected to
accept his reactions when we have, at
best, only a murky picture of who he
is? “

A -tenuous quality exists in the Gil-
mores' relationship, but we never see
enough of it to really feel one way or

‘ the other about the discord. Each of

the troubled marriages is infinitely
more_interesting than the tedious
clandestine affair we are forced to
witness. Perhaps the finest scene in
the film occurs when Frank informs
«his wife of his desires for Molly Gil-
more. I-Ier reactions are genuine and
expressive. A‘ wonderful
mance by Jane Kaczmarek—what we
see of her. A ' . ‘

As an audience, we never really
know why these people are doing
what it is they are doing or, in this

case, why they aren't doing things. A

wonderful story is happening around
the perimeter of this film. Unfortu-

nately, the writer misses it com--

pletely. Cristofer appears to be telling
the story he wants to tell, not the
story that is beggingto be told. I

. guess that is his prerogative.

 In Falling in Love, life happens to
these people. Nothing more. Nothing
less. The Raftis children are much
"more interesting than Molly's dying
old codger of a father, regardless of
his role as the crumbling male sup-
port in her life..The dialogue is soreal
at times that it borders on banality.
We are left with a story of people who
don't allow themselves to be
together. You know. Life. Feelings

ewe are _all painfully aware of_ every

day. Just because something is real
.doesn’t make it touching. It doesn't
necessarily.make for ajgood movie,
either. Falling in Love comes up short

‘on both counts. ‘

Can a New Age renaissance mansave the world?”

The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai is
"like a refreshing solar wind in the
doldrums of the overworked science
fiction genre. It teems with activity,
setting itself light years apart from
the dull pacing of recent special-

effects bonanzas. Instead of creating ’

interest by pinning mega-dollar visu-

- als to an otherwise predictable narra-

tive structure, this film has a barely

discernible plot that's riddled with a

clutter of extraneous cultural foot-

] - notes. The filmmakers poke fun at us,

 7 .at civilization in general and at sci-fi
' ' films while they're at it.

« Though it's a wispy—edged man-o-
war, the film's plot canbe summar-
ized as follows (Put on your thinking
caps and fasten your seat belts):

Buckaroo Banzai (Peter Weller) is
the ' quintessential product of the
baby-boom generation. Neurosur-

P geon, particle physicist, rock star and
jet car driver, he is the perfect eclectic
product of pop culture ideals. Contin-
uing the work,of his father, he devel-
ops an electronic circuit,

by Jeffrey Sewald

Imagine being invited to sit in on a

debate of such relevance that its- I

essence promises fresh insights into,
the problems of child-rearing, the
’ division of social classes and the on-
going battle of the sexes. Intrigued?
Sound more worthwhile than ‘a
straight-faced evening of prime-time
television? Pittsburgh Public Thea-
tre's current production of George
Bernard Shaw's classic comedy M isal-
licmce effectively conveys the keen

 philosophical perceptions, for which

the playwright is best known,

through an atmosphere of humorous
ribaldry. ’ ' ~
”They never do anything! They just

I discuss whether or not what others
I do is right!” announces Hypatia

Tarleton, the haughty 23-year-old
daughter of underwear czar John
Tarleton. Presented are six charac-
ters in all, dressed in the garb of turn-
of-the-century British ‘affluence,
either standing or seated comforta-
bly, talking- No. What we hear is
more than that. Try expounding.

The action of the play is lively and
spirited, employing just enough run-
ning about as well as the presence of

dramatic devices, such as a pistol
wielded carelessly to heighten inten-
sity. But the heart and blood of this
social satire is the dialogue, with the
characters not so much conversing as
they are orating. They define them-
selves via eloquent, self-disclosing
speeches that are strung together in a
neat, however long, message. Act one
is admittedly slow, taking far too
much time to’ establish the charac-
ters, but the remainder of the play
proceeds briskly with typical Shaw
character. ’

Performing the pivotal role of John

Tarleton, thesuccessful underwear I

manufacturer,. is Broadway veteran
Ford Rainey, who convincingly

recreates the confused magnate, a 4

man who desires the discovery of his
destiny,'an idea man, though most of
his ideas are borrowed. ”Read Mille.
Read Ibsen.” The old man consist-
ently qualifies his profundities.
Setting up the main thrust of the
play, that of the broad gap between
parent and child, are the Tarleton
kids, John Jr. (astutely played by

. Richard Hoyt-Miller) and the afore-

mentioned thrill"-seeking Hypatia,
who comes to life by way of the tal-
ents of lovely Stephanie Dunnarn.
Young John is not the rambler that

his father is but is representative of a.

new breed of free thinker, calling not
on the support of minds that have
gone before him but on his own wiles
and reasoning. The beautiful daugh-
ter is of a new breed herself —— a girl
destined to break the mold of the
kept-do,wn woman. '

the ”new way.” Keil’s characteriza-
tion is sturdy and believable as is

Rounding out the cast is Georgine

Hall as Mrs. Tarleton, the logical

opposition to the promiscuity of her

young daughter, a strong spokeswo- ‘

man for tradition. John Schuman's
Bentley Summerhays, the meek-of-
body, large—of-mind suitor to Hypa-
tia, provides much fuel for the
hilarity with his childish tantrums
and is offset neatly by David C. Jones’

of characters and the least impressive

If it weren't for the set and its inef-
fective attempts at establishing a
period look for the Tarleton house,

the production would have come
together in grand style, fitting the
excessive nature of Shaw — his
wordiness, cleverness and
intelligence. .

Though Misalliance raises many
questions, it offers no solutions, just
a chance to hear six people out. A
preponderance of engrossing per-
sonal opinion proving the point that
if one talks enough, he may provide
insight into the problems of others.
He may even discover himself.

EVERYTHING BUT THE
GIRL

Everything But The Girl

Sire A '

What hath Paul Weller
wrought? On this, their debut
lp, Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt
(who collaborated on The Style
Council's The Paris Match earlier
this year) have taken their lush
cabaret arrangements one step

further with this hopelessly

romantic, frequently affecting
record.

Tracey Thorn is the voice of
the band. Voice? ”The match
that started my fire” were some
of the words Weller gave her for
his band; here on‘ her own she
might well create some sort of
explosion. Her deep, mahogany
vocals are enough to cause tears
—— as well as cries for more.

Instrumentalist Watt pulls off
some Weller-esque jazzy guitar
and some nifty organ runs while

getting plenty of. help from
more than a dozen guest
players.

Never mind all these players,
though; this is Tracey Thorn’s.
baby — and she nurses it with
an abundance of tlc.

”Each and Every One,” the
band's first single and the open-
ing cut on the record, makes
beautiful use of the tradeoff
between Thorn’s voice and deli-
cate splashes of guitar and
trumpet. ,

”Frost and Fire” and ”Never
Could Have Been Worse” fea-
ture the same sparse, ‘dour
framing that made Yaz so
seductive at times. Only thing
is, EBTG bridge the gap that

.often came between Vince

Clarke's synthesizer noodlings
and Alf Moyet’s emotional
singing.

Although Everything But The
Girl lacks The Style Council's
extemporaneous edge, the for-

mula rarely gets to the point of -

self-indulgence. ”-Tender Blue”
and ”Easy As Sin" seem little
more than exercises in enticing
nightclub ambience, but the
band doesn't often falter to such

ordinary circumstances.

Everything But The Girl's fix-
ation ,with romance presents

the band with the same predica-
ment that relationships encoun-
ter — although the rewards
rarely come without unsatisfac-
tory moments, the results easily
justify the effort.

Lloyd Cole and the Commotions

Polydor

It's tough to get a fix on this
fellow. This is his first record.
He's not from any previous
band. Hell, this is only available
"' import. So where did he get

the maturity, the fire, the
knockout poetic insight to put
out a record like this? Beats me. -

Lloyd Cole sounds like The
Byrds, The Smiths, The Band,
The Flying Burrito Brothers,

. Julian Lennon, Echo and the

Bunnymen, the lost band from
the Easy Rider soundtrack  Like
I said, it's tough to get a fix on
‘him.

The instruments on this
record bear out the references
to bands past. Lots of acoustic
guitars playing warm, unhur-
ried leads, or fingerpicking —
remember fingerpicking? —
with bass, piano, tambourine,

and drums. Yet this is no simple '

revival act, no throwback to the

.'60s. It's more complicated than '

that. The mix is breathtakingly

margins. The record's sound is
lush and loamy, but not sloppy
or muddy. Each song is precise
and knife-edge keen, a perfect
setting for the startling power
of the lyrics. _ ‘

Lloyd Cole shares writing
credits with various band
members but the lyrics are all

his own. He is a storyteller. He
mines the _familiar terrain of
ambiguous modern relation-
ships, but he does’ it with a
peculiar cross between jaded
cynicism and an almost cheery
willingness to go on with it all.
The women, and they're all
about women, are people we've
all known. Lloyd Cole is at turns
hard and soft. He's not sure how
to mesh decency and selfishness
and a need for love into a liveable
code —.’no more certain than
any of us. But his ability to nar-
rate these "liaisons” surpasses

anybody I know of. Face-it, it's V

tough out here. And all this is, is
‘a record to journalize just how
"weird it can get. That, and how
pretty it- is to listen to make it
worth buying — even at import

'. prices.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers
have arrived, and not a moment

fierce, fast, funny ghetto funk
-heavily informed by -the punk
revolution. The fact thatthey’, re
all white doesn't matter — funk
is. an attitude, not a racial

The first five songs of this

"record show the full spectrum

of the Chili Peppers’ relentless

-originality. From the cool

thrash of ”True Men Don't Kill
Coyotes” to‘ the cocky self-
acclaim of "Baby Appeal” .to the

ooooopooooooooooooooooooofoooooooo

hilariously perverted Hank Wil-

vliams cover ”Why Don't You
_Love Me," the band plays with

unflagging intensity and a hip,
twisted sense of humor.

Side two isn't quite up to that
standard, and it really peters out
toward the end, but it has its
highlights. "Mommy Where's

7 Daddy” is truly sick but undeni-

ably funny, and "Police Helicop-
ter” must be sheer insanity live.

All the musicians play quite
proficiently, as this sort of
music demands, but -the bass
player, a stout little punk named
Flea, is incredible. I won't say
he's the best I've ever heard, but
he plays faster and more accu-
rately_than many guitarists play

This could be the party record
of 1984 (and 1985, for that mat-
ter). Take your dancing shoes

STEPHEN MORRISON -

(Waving the Black Flag

I am writing in regard to the review of Family Man by Black Flag appearing in
the Nov. 16 issue. The reviewer obviously detested the album, calling it ‘
’’horrendous’’ and ”a creation of noise.”I feel this reviewer has totally missed ‘

'the point of this album.

First of all, I cannot argue with his dislike ofthe four instrumental songs on
side two because that is his preference. What agitates me is the ignorance he
displays when speaking of side one (the spoken word side). He saysthat lead
vocalist (here lead spokesman) Henry Rollins should try "to have an impact
beyond that of a simple-minded group of sheep."

I strongly disagree.

Mr. Rollins is as confused about society as any of us are. He's not trying to
lead us to any promised land. He's simply.telling us what he thinks is wrong.
with society — he tells us only what he knows and feels and never goes beyond

that.

Black Flag means one word to me, and that is brutal honesty. They are not

  

offering solutions to the world's problems because they don't have the slight-
est idea what those solutions are. Mr. Rollins just wants to relate some of his
ideas with others who have a more cynical outlook. What's wrong with that?

If you don't understand hardcore, Black Flag isn't trying to preach to you or
change your life. This is an album for people who think for themselves, and I
think it's a shame that the reviewer put the album down as garbage when he
missed the whole idea behind it. ' .i . G '

The writing on the back of the album jacket by co—producer Harvey Kuber-
nik sums it up. ”You go into the darkness with them [Black Flag] and they are
sort of the guides. Some people don't want to run with it. Honesty.” I sure
cannot call that senseless ”bullshit."

and women with-pre-ordained color-
by-numbers lives waiting to be filled

in by_an inexorable "Higher Artist."

Love, wealth and success are vast,
vague, and therefore unattainable in
any practical sense. Those who

‘inhabit Silvis’ world accept fate with a-

certain amount of stoicism stemming '
not from inner strength but from an

. unwillingness or inability to counter?

act the catastrophe of their day-to-
day existence. ’
Emiliano Fortunato, at 17, returns

-. from war and finds himself the only

V eligible young man left in his village.

A veritable sexual wonderland
unfolds, and‘ he considers himself
truly ”The Luckiest Man ‘in the

in Writin g

World.” But slowly and deliberately,

' the situation gets out of hand — sus-

picion and discontent grow, propel-
ling the tale to a horrifying/fascin-
ating conclusion.

And others: The pathetic Major
Zoya needs only a pint of gin to recall
”One Night with a Girl by the Seine”
and thus escape the derision of his
wife and hometown. A priest, a pro-
miscuous girl, a brash young man and
two sheriffs collide "purely by acci-
dent" as they seek release from the
(primarily sexual) tensions built up
during ”A Walk in the Moonlight.”

"Trash Man" offers a churning

‘ depiction of a single day in the life of a

garbage collector, trapped physically,
mentally and socially by his job; his

_ singular goal is to forget. A two—day

vacation at the beach promises ro-
mance (or atleast comparable forms
of gratification) for a pair of brothers
and their friend but delivers double
tragedy among the traditions of
"Prayer and Old Jokes,” gently sad,

 

school

ironic,-and the best of the collection. .

”Now’I did not know which way to
run,” the narrator explains, helpless
but without self-pity. .

”The Fatalist" overhears a murder

plot and decides to rob the intended I

victim's house at the time the murder
is to take place. The /fatalist’s philoso-
phy serves as the thematic center of
of The Luckiest Man in the World: "Let

fate take its course. At the last.
moment, you could always rush in A

and try to gain some advantage from
fate’s sudden twists.” With luck. The

hope, however slight, that good will «
hit and evil will miss is implied, but i

with the concession that little or
nothing can influence destiny.

Mapping a series of strange jour-W

neys toward the inevitable, Randall
Silvis has crafted a uniformly excel-
lent and thoughtful collection of sto-
ries memorable characters
victimized by the magic tracks of fate‘
— suggesting no solutions except,
simply, to cope.

Pitt's own alternative space, the_ UP
Gallery, is currently presenting a
one-woman show entitled Alison
‘Helms: Aquatic Constructions. The exhi-
bition displays a vast cluster of mate-
rials used in assorted kinds of works.
These works include pastel paintings,
paintings on wood and her own aqua-
. '_c constructions. These construc-
tions reflect Alison Helms'.own life at
the sea and representsome aspect of
sea life.
The P constructions are ‘made of
painted wood, silk screen and various
other materials such as plastic, metal
and even neon light. They are layers

  U rzderwater constructions

of screens, one on top of each other, -

‘ that hang on the wall. Strips of

painted wood are fixed over the dif-
ferent layers that suggest fish, boats
or other aquatic symbols. ‘

Each layer of screen has something
different fixed over it, and each
screen is often a different color. The
colors of the screen are ‘ usually
marine shades of blue, green or pur-
ple. The colors create a cool, tranquil
underwater atmosphere. The ripples
on the screen, which flow_rhyth_mi-
cally as you move your vision across
the screen, capture perfectly with

‘ eerie -realism the rippling flow in the

water's surface. When looking" at
these aquatic constructions, the

actual colors that one sees are"

unclear, because they are seen behind
colored screen_s which obscure their
real colors. _
Each of these aspects of the con-
'structions* perfectly imitates the
actual characteristics of water as seen
from directly above, which is how the
viewer sees the water in these works.
The different layers of screen imitate
the water's depth. A boat form may
be on the top layer and fish forms on
the lower, subsequent layers. The
‘distortion of colors and forms in the
constructions imitates the very same
effect of water on colors and form.

__Unlike a real ocean where depth,
_color and form are all merged

together, Alison Helms’ work takes

each aspect of the sea and represents '

it individually.

She creates a number of other

works that use the screen and painted

scenes themselves. She has a piece '

entitled ”Anchor Trap” that is an
anchor constructed of a wooden
frame and screens. It may not be
imitating the sea, but the rippling

screen, frame and color reflect the

sea’s surface, depth and color. One
piece is called ”Shocking the Lake,"
and this is expressed by having a pink
neon light going around the inside of
a frame of an aquatic construction.
Another construction is the skeleton
of a fish done in brilliant green and
pink transparent plastic. The lavishly
colored plastic is just what you would
find in a cheap five—and—dime store
toy. It gives the work a bouncy and
playful effect. Overall, the exhibition
is exciting with flowing, pulsating
energy that calls’ forth the excitement
of aquatic forms. ‘

 
  

  

DELIVERY AFTER

by Jeffrey Sewald

Frank Zappa is an enigma. He
accepts this. His review clips often
read like adjective-embellished D.A.
rap sheets — indictment after indict-
ment after indictment. Frank Zappa,
the consistently controversial com-
poser!arrangerlguitarist: arguably
the most accused man in the history
of popular music. "

"I think I am. When people don't
like what I do, they take it out on me
personally. It's got nothing to do with
my music. People actually hate me as
a person because what I do seems to
threaten something about the way
they live."

After a series of more than 30
albums spanning the better part of
two decades, rock's bastard child, its
elusive entity, has launched yet
another concert tour in an effort to
bolster support for his latest vinyl
endeavor, Them or Us.

A double set of extreme variety,
the album runs the gamut from a
Zappasized cover of the Allman
Brothers’ hit "Whipping Post," to a
track co-authored by his 10-year-old
son entitled "Frogs With Dirty Little
Lips." Them or Us is a definitive depar-
ture from his albums of recent years.

"Man From Utopia was probably one
of the most despised records that I
ever did because it had some songs on
it that were just too weird for people.
This album doesn't have any resem-
blance to that except that I happened
to like the Man From Utopia album
where nobody else did.”

It is almost as if he can't help him-
self. Counter-indictments of the
musical press run wildly throughout
his speech. Those critics. Those self-
righteous, know-nothing paragons
of misunderstanding. They're on the
streets. They're in the bushes. They
cast stones of ignorance at Zappa. A
slight case of paranoia? Perhaps. But
Zappa’s contention that his work is
often misinterpreted shines of truth.
There is a constant desire to define
him, to explain, to label. To evaluate
Frank Zappa in a "pop" sense. Did I
say "pop"? Face it. Songs like "Jazz
Discharge Party Hats"-and "Danger-
ous Kitchen’ were never designed for
the Billboard pantheon of goldies.

"Look here,” Zappa interjects with
a characteristically resonant voice. "If
you want to label it, the best thing
you can do is say that it's specialized
entertainment for people who can tell
the difference. I conceive it as enter-
tainment..It’s not like taking castor
oil. You're not supposed to hold your
nose and sit and suffer through it. If
you don't like it, don't listen to it. It's
designed for those people who
already like it, who already know
what the humor is or know why this
stuff is impossible. Given the climate
of the times in the America of the
'80s, it is statistically impossible that]
exist.”

The «mass-market America of the
'80s. Somehow, it doesn't seem like
the appropriate sounding board for
Zappa’s specialized brand of enter-
tainment. But the American market
is still the world's largest with respect
to potential record sales. A quick scan
of the charts leaves Zappa in the dust
with a hungry market consuming
more and more hype everyday.

”I’m not here to fulfill the needs of
the person that must own a Boy
George record. I've got nothing
against Boy George or the music he
makes, or against the people who buy
it. It's just that what I do is vastly
different from ordinary pop music,
OK? And I don't intend to change.

There are people who like what I do,

;!

Showcase, Friday, November 30, 1984
: 

I stand accused: Zappa lays down the law

and they want that. I do it for them."
While proclaiming his altruism
toward those with the Zappa mind
set, Zappa fails to mention an impor-
tant part of his audience  himself.
"If I want to write 'Valley Girl,’ I'll
do it. If I want to write ']azz Dis-
charge Party Hats,’ I'll do it. I don't
give a fuck. I'm not waiting for some-
one to pat me on the head and say I'm
doing a good job or someone to say
I'm doing a shitty job. I don't live or

die on the opinions of what people on
a newspaper or a magazine have
about my work because, basically, it's
irrelevant. The final decision as to
whether or not it turned out good is
mine. I'm _the only one who knows
what the initial idea was and I'm the
only one who knows how close the
performance gets to the original
idea."

1979 saw the charts Frank-out for
a while when "Dancin' Fool," a par-
ody of the then flourishing disco
scene, rocketed its source lp to the
No. 22 spot. Ship Too Late To Save A
Drowning Witch yielded more social
stereotype satire with "Valley Girl,"
one of the more memorable novelties
of 1-982.. But still, most of Zappa’s

_ material remained radio inaccessible.

"Well, everything is radio inaccessible
unless you're paying them to play it,
do'you understand? Look, if I wanted
to spend a quarter of a million dollars,
I could take any one of those things
and say, 'OK, here it is. Here's your
hit record.’ But what the fuck for? I'm»
not in the business of making hit
records. I'm in the business of doing
whatever kind of music I feel like
doing at the time." ,

Throughout Zappa’s diatribe. on
the evils of mass-marketing, his
anger toward the critical world often
bubbles over into directaffront.

"Here's the point. The press is
wrong. Nobody in the press ever
bought a fucking record, OK? The
press is entitled to its opinion, but I do
my work for people who buy records
and buy concert tickets and listen to it
and like it. The press is out of step

jwith the desires of those people who

have bought literally _millions of /

albums since I started, OK? Now
somebody is wrong, and it's the guy
with the pencil."

Zappa’s criticism of the print
media, while not completely
unfounded, fails to acknowledge the
fact that the press has done much to
perpetuate his image as a renegade
musical force. The more he is des-
pised, the more beloved he is to his
fans. Is he a joke or a genius? This
question has followed him through-
out his career. Perhaps a dichotom-

ous relationship exists in his work,
that of the sneering satirist balanced
by the serious composer.

"That's not true, because, first of
all, I started off writing orchestral
and chamber music when I was 14,
and I didn't even write a rock 'n' roll
song until I was 21. So, it's not like I
suddenly decided to write classical
music. I've done that stuff for years.
Inside the instrumental music there's
all kinds of stuff, but a person won't
know the satire unless he has a broad
knowledge of other instrumental
music so he can see where the musical
jokes lie."

Zappa will not openly divulge his
list of stylistic influences, but he will
confess that his inspiration comes
from the sameesource as everyone

-else's: "Little golden drops from the

sky that come down and tell you
you're creative." I-Iis little golden
drops have looked like hellfire to
much of the press. '
"They're threatened. They're
upset that I can keep doing it. That it
exists. They realize that they don't
understand it and if you don't under-
stand something, in order to main-
tain your self-esteem, you have to say
this thing I don't understand is shit.
And that makes you a better person
and that makes me a villain because
I'm doing this stuff. People have been
trying to explain me away for 20
years, and I think that a longtime
from now, they're are going to dis-
cover they made a mistake."
Critics. Critics. Critics. The
world's full of them, and Zappa feels
that few are willing to place their
heads on the "chopping block by
expressing delight at his work lest
they fall from the grace of their peers
and their readership, en masse.
"That's one ofthe reasons why if
somebody gives a good review to

something, then everybody else fol- . ~

lows suit because they don't want to
be left out. It's kind of an American
herd instinct that takes over."

Never one for the frilly world of I".
commerciality or the corporate gam-
bit process, Zappa’s career _has with-
stood many dips and detours.
Throughout all, his loyal following
has remained intact. But, while
America has been a reasonably steady
market for him, his records have
done surprisingly well overseas. Part
of the problem in the U.S. is the fact
that the majority of his work never
hits the airwaves. Radio pro- .«
grammers are tough on enigmatic
musical renegades.

"The musical outlook of the coun-
try, in the broadest sense, is deter-
mined by all media. First ofall, what
do you hear on the radio? You only
hear what is formatted. What do you
read in the papers? It is what is con-
nected to what will sell because the
rock 'n' roll business is like any other
business. It is not flying by itself. It
has little cohorts along with it...“-
Merchandisers, clothing manufac-
turers, candy companies, beer com-
panies — shit like that. The
merchandising factors are immense.
OK, I don't play the game. Anybody
today can have a hit record if they pay
out the right bribes to the right _peo—
ple. That's what the rock 'n' roll busi-
ness is. It's an ugly fact, but that's
exactly what it is. It's back to the same
payola that existed during the '50s. It
used to be a $100 bill stuffed inside%
the sleeve of your 45 single and you
sent it to the disc jockey and he played
it on the station and it was a hit.

"It’s a racket, and I'm not interested
in being in the racket. I want to make
music, and I make it in a way that
appeals to people who don't like bull-
shit. If there is one thing that has
been interesting about this tour, it's ‘I

.that the response of the audience to

what the band is doing is like 'thank
you for not stopping.’ "

Frank Zappa, the ceaseless enigma
of rock 'n' roll. But then,.what is an
enigma if not a victim of scrambled
signals?

Spikers set
for NCAAS

By Laurie Kubli

The (Pitt News

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
travels to Nebraska today to take on
the No. 7 Cornhuskers in the first
round of. the NCAA playoffs. Pitt
(30-7) is among the top 28 teams in
the country following its victory in
the Big" East Conference final two
weeks ago.

Senior Cathy Rupp said that her
team will have to go intothe match
trying not to let the pressure of play-
ing such a highly—ranked team defeat
them even before they'step onto the
court._ »

“We'll be nervous, but it'll be a
good’ kind of nervous," she said.
“We have to go in not feeling the
pressure of being in-the NCAAs."

Coach Shelton Collier believes

‘ experience will aid his team tomor-

row. “[Nebraska] has beaten several
Californian teams and is considered
among the best in the country. J

' “But it's an advantage [for us]
because we played them early in the
year and we have improved t_re-

' mendously since then, having won.
~ 18 of the last 20," Collier explained.

“Losing to them early provided us
with the motivation to work harder
and set our sights to winning at tha
level." _ ~
Collier said that he expects close
to 4,000 fans to attend and _that this
will be to his advantage because Pitt

is the underdog. “We're hoping that

if we can get to them a little early,
that will be some additional pressure
for them," he said.

Rupp concurred. “We're the’

underdogs, which will be to our
advantage," she said. “There will be
a big Nebraska crowd,’ but we've
played really well on the road. We've
got nothing to lose — just go for it."
0,8, l6,24,32,40,48,56,64,72lose —
just go for it."

Collier. has been relying on Rupp, It

and four-time tournament MVP
Ulana Kohutiak to have outstand-
ing performances in leading the

' team to victory, but this match will

require few mistakes on the parts of
all the players.

“Once you get to this level, your

can no _longer_rely on justatwo or

we defeated Penn State [then ranked
‘No. _7], we had great performances
from ‘Pat Belcher, Louise O’Shaugh-

main. reason we -beat them."

women's coach Donna Sanft.

Freshman Cathy Coleman was
both. “I'll be very excited and
nervous.” ‘ __

Kim _Ca1derone, another fresh-
man, agreed with her teammate. “I'll
be excited; it will be different with
that many people there watching.
Our first two meets were in here,"
she said, looking around the Trees
Hall gymnasium, a place only
slightly larger than a PAT bus.

For this meet, the final score will
matter less than the experience
gained. ,

“The level of competition in this
meet is so high that .I don't think we
can win as a team," said men's head
coach Frank D'Amico, “but we can
win a few individual events. There
will be ‘some good routines for us
and some good routines for the Jap-
anese team."

Even if the Pitt teams do not win a
single event, freshman Jorge San-
chez still sees the potential this meet
has as a good jumping-off point.
“This meet will set the tone. for the
rest of the season. We aren't looking
to go out and win, but from this meet
we can progress to our regular
season.”

Added Calderone, “We are just
going to -go out and try ‘to hit our
routines as best we can and not
worry about the final score; just go
out ‘and’ have fun.” = V

In one regard, the meet could not
have come at a worse time. Both
teams have been weakened by a rash
of recent injuriesthat have sidelined
key performers. “We’ve had bad
-luck with injuries," Sanft said.
“Alisa Spector sprained four ﬁngers
in our opening. meet and will not
compete in the bars, and Julie
Waters has been sick for a week and
just started to work out again yester-
day." Ending a short career because
of an injury that compares to Cliff

Kristy Pietersinjured her hand on
Wednesday while'—— get this — sew-
ing. Pieters was not expected to par-

' ticipate in the meet, but the word at
I last night's practice was__ that she

would compete in three events.
The injury bug also bit the men's
team, according to D'Amico.
“Kevin Garren was taken out this
week because of a contusion on his

_ spine. I'm“ not making excuses, but

that injury is really going to hurt us.”

Sanft still sees a few bright spots
for her young squad. “The vaulting
and the beam will be our two strong
events," she 'said.,She noted, how-
ever that the injuries had taken their
toll. “The bars will be more of a
problem than we thought because of
the injuries to Alisa and Kristy. I
think the ﬂoor will be our weakest
event; it probably will be going into
the season, too. We need a lot of
work in that area."

Penn St.  

-By Kirsten Gostony

<ThePittNews

The Panther wrestling team‘

gained its first dual meet victory by
defeating Waynesburg College on
Wednesday evening with a score of
33-9. Co-captains Joe Bond and
Kyle Nellis led the way, both having
added six points to the team score by
defeating their opponents with falls.

Nellis, wrestling at I34 lbs., built

his score to 21-5, giving him what is -

now considered a technical fall. This
season, the rule has been added that
when a wrestler is able to defeat his
opponent by 15 or more points, he is
awarded six points for a technica
fall. '

' Bond added his points by defeat-
ing his opponent Bill Mundell at 158
lbs., with the fall coming at 5:04 in
their match. _

Waynesburg gained its nine
points with wins in the ll8-lb. tight
bout, "when Mark Hogue‘defeated
Pitt's Joe Iagemma 10-8, and in the

177-lb. match-up, in which Mark '

Kissell pinned Panther freshman
Ken Hackman.

“Overall, we're extremely pleased‘
with the team's performance," said

head coach Rande Stottlemyer. “We ’

started four freshmen, and although
two of them were beaten, they
fought with intensity. Waynesburg
has improved immensely since last
season, and they gave us a tough

match. They fought hard.

“As you can see, we're a young
team and we'll be looking toward
our junior co-captains, Bond and

‘ Nellis, as well as the other upper-
classmen to carry the team,” con-

tinued Stottlemyer.

“After a win like Wednesday
night's where everyone wrestled up
to their potential, the team's enthusi-
asm and spirit are like never before,"
said Bond. “The morale is high and
if the team pulls together and shows
its character, it'll be a great season."

The team, however, must main-,
tainiits drive and determination as it
travels to the highly competitive
Penn State Invitational this week-
end, where they will compete against
wrestlers from 26 other teams.
Opponents include schools ranked
in the Top 20: North Carolina,
Maryland, Syracuse, Clemson,

Clarion and host Penn State. They

will also be competing against some
excellent Division III schools.

only played one home game this
season, and they had a real big
I crowd," said right wing Roger
Oldaker. “The fans won't make
that much of a’ difference. I don't
‘ think it will hurt us asmuch as it
will get the other team fired up."

WVU next, but Dukes bigger challenge  

The Panther defense has been
building strength and momen-
tum throughout the season.
Defenseman John Pettit in par-'
ticular has shown great improve-
ment over the last few weeks.
“Pettit is coming on unbelieva-
bly. Every game and every prac-
tice, he gets better and better,"
said Oldaker. The rest of the Pitt

defense is improving right along

with him. «

“We have the best defense in
the league," said left wing Jim
Owens, Jr. ‘‘It's just a matter of
getting them together ‘— then
nobody will be able to stop us."

Both on and off t-heice, the
defense is giving the Panthers the

The Pitt skaters are confident
that they can outplay WVU,
tomorrow, but at the same time
they are -wary about making any
predictions. “West Virginia isn't
as strong as they were in the past r_
so this will be a good tune-up

Runners head forhills

By Rich McKenzie
‘. The Pitt News

“Our team is still in its infancy,"

said fourth-year coach Elbert
Kennedy when describing the
women’s track team and program

-~ here at Pitt. He feels that, through

time and hard work, the the team

. can become a force to be reckoned V
with in the East. He said that “it

takes time to build a program that
has character, growth and consis-
tency. There are highs and lows
involved in building a quality pro-
gram.” As was the case last year,
there are only six athletes on the
squad this season. However, those
few runners made their presence felt
in several meets. Highlights of the

season included a victory of the V

sprint medley relay at the Princeton
Invitational as well as finishing
second to nationally-ranked Villa-
nova at the Big East indoor cham-

_ pionships in the 1600-meter relay.

Coach Kennedy feels that there is
indeed something to build on, as last
year‘s team also set 10 school
records. He said, ‘‘In the next few
years, with the help of good recruit-
ing, the Pitt women's track program
should be outstanding."

The 1984-85 squad is led by
returning senior Renee Henderson,
who has, among her accomplish-
ments, eight individual school and
eight meet records, including four
Big East conference records. She
also gained All-America status in
the I00-meter dash and was named
the Pitt team MVP for the last three
seasons. Kennedy said of his tal-
ented senior, “Right now, Renee is
taking the first step into the big-time
arena of college track and field. She
has shown the characteristics of
athletic ability, hard work and con-
sistency that are needed to excel. She
has all the tools needed to become
very, very good.”

Tomorrow (Dec. 1), the team
opens up its season when it travels to
West Virginia for the WVU Devel-
opmental Meet. ‘

.The Pitt women's swimming
and diving team gets to mix busi-
ness and pleasure when it travels
to University Park to compete in
the Penn State Relays.

The business end of the bar-
gain is swimming "well; the plea-
sure, according to Coach Dave
Belowich, relates to the unusual
notion that the swimmers expect
to have fun. “It should be a fun
and exciting meet,” he said.

“Some of the events the
swimmers haven’t swum in
years.”

Belowich said the 400-yard IM
is a good example of that kind of
event. “There are four people
swimming 100 yards each.iThat
is usually a 10 [years-old]-and-
under event, so most of the
swimmers haven’t- had the
chance to compete in it in years.”

The meet will also be a chance
for the Pitt athletes to take care
of the business of -qualifying for
the NCAA championship meet

held in the spring. The relays for

Swimmers expect fun

which they can qualify include
the 200-yard freestyle, the 200-
yard medley ‘and the 800-yard
freestyle.

The “a'll-relay meet,” accord-
ing to sophomore Susan Hick-
man, is a nice break from regular
competition. The reason, she
said, is that events like the cre-
scendo, where the length that
each member of the team swims
varies, do not exist in regular
competition.

Hickman Salt] [Hal tncrc lb :1
lot of excitement and support in
the relays. “Relays are always
fun because it’s a team effort, not
just an individual‘ race.” She
added that this team effort can
result in faster times for the
swimmers.

The second goal of the meet
for the Panthers is to make some
NCAA qualifying times. Coach
Belowich is Very confident that
his team, which is presently 4-0,
will do just that.‘ “We have a lot
of depth, and there are not many
weak spots on the team.” He said
that they’ll be making both indi-
vidual and team attempts at the
qualifying times. '

The Pitt women's basketball team I

headed west on a winning note last
night after defeating the.Colonials of
Robert Morris College 82-44 Wed-
nesday night. Coach Judy Saurer’s
squad is now in Evanston, 111., and
will take on top-ranked and unde-

feated Old Dominion in first-round‘

action of the Northwestern Tourna-
ment tonight. . ‘

Old Dominion boasts a talented
lineup. Coach Maria-nne Stanley
could have her strongest team since
Nancy Leiberman led the 1980
squad to‘the AIAW championship.
This year's catalyst is 6-3 senior All-
America Medina Dixon. Dixon led
the Monarchs to the NCAA tourna-
ment last year as she averaged 20.8
ppg and 10.6 rpg.

Joining Dixon on the front line
will be junior Dawn Cullen (9 ppg, 6
rpg) and senior Tracy Claxton.
Claxton stands 6-1 and averaged

~ over 19 ppg while playing opposite

Dixon at the forward slot last year.
Freshmen Adrienne Goodson and
Donna Harrington, two high school
All-Americas last year, will provide
depth off the bench. Freshman Val
Avant and sophomore Marie Chris-
tian will team up in the Old Domin-
ion backcourt. With four returning
starters and three quality freshmen,
ODU should give Saurer and Pitt all
they can handle. ’ '

Pitt will counter this experience
and depth with some of its own.
Leading the way willbe senior All-
America Jennifer Bruce. This sea-

son, Bruce is averaging 29.5 ppg,

including 25 points and six rebounds

in -Wednesday night's effort against _

Robert Morris. _
Teaming with Bruce will ,be senior
sharpshooter Stephanie Collins,

‘ senior Lisa Fubio, passing specialist

Kim Tirik and 6-5 Jenny Tyner.
Fubiog and Tirik each handed out
four assists Wednesday night.
Providing the offense off the
bench will be "Kim Gannis, Jane
Plake, Pam Novosel, Ellen Gilhoo-

“Since there isn’t a team title at
this tournament, it will be an excel-
lent opportunity for individuals to
evaluate where they stand for the
season,” explained assistant coach

Jack Spates, “because it would be an

excellent showing."

“lt’s nice coming off a win for the
big tournament this weekend,”
Bond concluded. “lt‘s a good tour-
nament to compete in since it serves
as a measuring stick for the season.
Individually, we'll be able to meas-
ure our strengths and weaknesses.
Everyone is ready to cut loose and
just go for it."

The tournament opens today with
matches at 10 a.m. and is scheduled
to close with "Saturday evening’s-
championship finals at 7 p.m.

Hoopers win, head forOD(l

‘ley and Valerie Halesworth. Saurer

enjoys the luxury of a very full
bench. “I'd have to say that the

bench makes this team," said
Saurer. “Gannis, Gilhooley,
Novosel and" Plake do a real fine
job.” —»

The Panthers will have to put
together_a maximum effort to knock
off Old Dominion. -

HOOP NOTES: Pitt will ‘play’

round game tonight  Through two
games, the Panthers areaveraging

‘he’s concerned about it,” Chipman '

added, “but after each practice he’s
looking.better."

Chip Watkins, coming off his fin-
est Pitt game, in which he had 19
points, will start at forward ahead of
Andre Williams, though--Chipman
refuses to admit it’s a sign of things
to come. “Andre is perhaps a little
more versatile in that he can play
any of three positions,” Chipman
said of the Brooklyn senior, who was
earlier projected as astarter. “And I
