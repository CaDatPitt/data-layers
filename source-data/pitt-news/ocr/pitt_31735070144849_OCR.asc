j - The typical image of a lobby-
 ist involves anuindividual‘ clad in
§ a suit vexing some Washington

V  politician about the interests of a

 big tobacco company.

 But here’s a type of lobbyist

 who just doesn’t fit that mold: the

 Pitt student.

: Last month, three buses_ full

 of Pitt students, alumni and Uni—'
 versity administrators traveled

 to Harrisburg to lobby for more

E'money for Pitt. The group be-.
 seeched Pennsylvania legislators

 in response to Gov. Ed Rendell’s

 freeze on state funding for Pitt.

: Pitt’s governmental relations

 ofﬁce organized the trip and col-

} laborated with Student Govern-

5 ment Board to enlist  P
 thelobbying effort.
 Colleges and college students
F are both directly and indirectly in-
 volved with lobbying. Despite 

    

g the negativity and political scorn‘
 associated with this activity, it’s ’
‘E necessary in upholding’Pitt’s in-~

 terests. Because the majority of
 issues lobbyists advocate relate to
 money, the results of lobbying --1
_ both good and bad — inﬂuence
 all aspects of Pitt’s functioning.

SGB and other student groups ,

i work to inﬂuence elected officials
 on federal, state and local levels.
 But in addition to‘ students‘ in-
 volved with the process, Pitt spent
 $690,000 last year alone on lobby-

is 3 ing expenses at the federal level.

Although theamount spent on

iii lobbying varies each year, the Uni- ‘

A 3. versity might decrease the amount ,

 of moneyit spends on lobbying’

 in an ‘effort to decrease expenses
: the troubled economy. ’

While’:-_ lobbyists can’t promise

A: s.ureﬁre ;favorable results, their

      EDITORIAL  j      
Lobbying for its still

A ‘efforts  still imiportant to 

University Whether they’re paid
’ professionals or just students

and.adi_;nir1istrators looking to be
politicallyijinvolved, there’s a key
aspectiflof lobbying that can’t be
forgotten; making sure the Uni-
Versity’s'voice is heard.

No matter how willing state .

legislators are to listen and con-

sider the insistencies of students, §
/0 their efforts and their experience 
can only beneﬁt Pitt’s interests
_ and themselves. .

. Students practicing lobby-
ing get involved with real—world,  ‘
hands-on politics. The students -
who went" to _ Harrisburg un— 
doubtedly learned- -something;

Even so, Pitt can’t depend on 5
student lobbyists alone. With our:
economy the way it is, it seems the 
University is cuttingback funding
in nearly every facet of its opera— 
tions. Diminishing the amount of g
money spent on lobbyists to a de— gr
vgree might be reasonable, but the 
University shouldn’t underfund:
this practice. Again, even if state?

see politicians having the times
of their lives. Righteous indigna-

instead of controlling your anger,

the moral impetus is on letting it

ﬂow, like giving a urine sample of
emotion. It even seems like some
senators have-been holding their
anger all these years, just to make

it that much? more impressive
_when they let. loose all over your

TV screen. ._ ,
And.if- there’s one thing every-
one can get righteously indignant

It’s not the ﬁrst time this year
our congresspersons showed off

how mad they can get over other
» people making money._ Today the

Left is its hands over

bonuses, but a few months ago,

it was the Right freaking out over

the $70 pethout that UAW Work-

ers were raking in. This $70 is sort

of a mythical ﬁgure — both in its

Who arewe to decide — or
even care — how much someone‘

why should we care more com-

The truth is that we usually
don’t care how much other people
earn. Americans are almost unique
among the world’s peoples for a

laissez—faire attitude toward their
neighbors’ pay stubs. Generally,.

But something they didn’t take

By focusing on improving the

acting otherwise will not solve the
issues of global markets. Instead,
conferences such as the G-20

summit need to pay attention to '
the needs of countries and people-

Doing_so means creating inno-
vative solutions, ones that will rec-
ognize that different economies
have different needs. Nobel laure-
ate _Muhamrnad Yunus, a pioneer

A fraction of what is being
poured into Wall Street through
bailouts could save the lives of
millions. Though executivesmight
think fewer cars and houses for
them is a tragedy, such misfortune
is eclipsed by the tragedy of chil-
dren dying of malnutrition.

The average American prob-

- ably, doesn’t have time. to con-

template what economic ' stimulus
packages will do for people on the
other side of the globe. That is
why it is the responsibility of our
leaders to address such issues, es-
pecially at a conference meant to
help the whole world.

The measures announced in the
pasthfew days will not get any na-

‘tions out of a recession overnight. ~

And handling the economic prob-
lems of the poor will be harder
still, especially if they are allowed
to fester. That is why the United
States and the rest of the G-20
can’t linger. They must act before
a solution is beyond reach.

ernment intervention is measured

in more than just the expenditures
of tax dollars. It is also. the strife
our society has to bear to take col-
lective action. Citizens who used
to not care about each other are

now at each other’s throats. The _

oldargument, “lt’s none of your
business,” loses most of its punch
when the business in question ——
AIG or General Motors —— actu-

woes wil

ally isiyour business, if you’re a.
citizen ‘of America. Hence, -the
post-bailout world is haunted by
new strainsof logic, like:

1. Some corporations got bailouts.
2. Some rich people have some

kind of fuzzy association with '

corporations.
3. All the rich people and corpo-
rations owe us all their money.

If you’ve spent much time

l cost more than attention

abroad, you might have noticed
the absence of violent protests

that happen in America. That’s

because in America, there’s less
incentive to have a‘ protest. Pro-
tests are to get public attention,
but when your remuneration
isn’t a public matter, there’s noth-
ing gained by a protest. In South
America, by contrast, youcan go
out in the streets and see the taxi

drivers upset over what the gov-
ernment has regulated their raises
to be this year.

The protests we’re seeing now
over CEO compensation, like the
strikes we’re sure to see when it
comes time to slice and ‘dice Gen-
eral »Motors and Chrysler —- to
the necessary misery of thou-
sands of autoworkers —'— are a
consequence of a situation when

protesting could actually yield
the individuals protesting a siz-
able proﬁt. And the time wasted
protesting, lobbying, arguing on
TV news and writing articles like

this one are a real cost on society.

I wish I could’ve written a funny
article today. But duty. called.

of “Adventureland” two years
ago —- on location at Kenny-

wood amusement park in West
l\/[ifﬂin —'director Greg Mot-

tola wouldn’t spend his breaks

would take the crew and unwind
by. riding “some of‘ the greatest

ever seen. I
“Just go on that a couple times
in a row, and it rattles your brains
out,” said Mottola in a confer-
ence-call interview.
“Adventureland,” a new teen-
ager coming-of-age "ﬁlm written

and directed by Mottola, circles -

around the life of a fresh college
graduate working a summer job at
a theme park in Pittsburgh called
Adventureland. The story is all
too familiar to Mottola.

Mottola based the film off of
his own personal experience of
working at an amusement park
in the summer, namely falling in
love and getting paid minimum

 

wage. Some of the characters are

based on real ‘people — the main
character’s love interest, portrayed
"by Kristen Stewart, is a composite
sum of Mottola’s own girlfriends
from his early‘ 20s. I

. But some characters,‘like the

married park owners played by

“Saturday Night Live’s” Bill Had- ’

er and Kristen W/iig,'are characters
borne directly out of Mottola’s
imagination. ' 3

“I took the people that I
thought were the most interesting
charactersto inhabit this world
and mixed theminto the ﬁlm and
made up a story,” said Mottola.
“I didn’t dateia woman who had
.the exact issues and struggles
that Kristen Stewart’s character
had, but I had heard stories like
that.” I

Jonah Hill, is -probably Mottola’s

and more rounded if you actually
see yourself in it or have some
feeling about it,” said Mottola. “I
don’t expect this movie to be the

cultural phenomenon that ‘Super-

bad’ was — I never did. It’s much

more bittersweet and melancholy,

about making things feel realistic
and psychologically true.”

There is no Adventureland in
Pittsburgh. The story was origi-
nally supposed to take place in
Long Island, N.Y., near the ac-
tual Adventureland, but shooting
shifted to Pittsburgh because of
ﬁnancial circumstances. Film-
makers get a larger tax rebate for
making a movie in Pennsylvania
than they do in New York.

Mottola planned to transform
Pittsburgh into Long Islandfor
the Elm but changed his mind
after reminiscing about his col-
lege days at Carnegie‘ Mellon
University.

“As soon as Igstarted to drive
around the city, the nostalgia for

. my college years came back,” he

said. “I thought, well, that’s stupid.

I should really make it about Pitts- V

burgh. I really love Pittsburgh. It
has so much character.”

Years after receiving an art de-
gree from CMU, Mottola made
his first movie in 1994, “The Day-
trippers.” Initially, much hype sur-

rounded the ﬁlm and the director I

Grand Jury Prize at the Slamdance
Film Festival in 1996, but it went

“Arrested Development” and
“Undeclared,” but he regrets
rejecting the opportunity to di-
rect an episode of “Freaks and
Geeks,” an opportunity offered
to him.by his good friend Judd
Apatow.

“The ‘biggest mistake I ever
made in my career was being blind
to some great opportunities in

Decemberists,‘ page 7
“The’Rake.”

You can see how  might have been a‘

difficult musical.

The album starts off calmly enough, as an
eerie prelude gives way to an acoustic media-
tion on, of course, the hazards of love.

“Myitrue love‘ went riding out in white and .

green and gray, / Past the Pale of Offa’s wall

where she was wont to stray,” sings Meloy. i‘
The album then launches into “A Bower,
I —— to say the least. The plot-driven duets, in

Song,” and with it comes the dark guitar
distortion that hangs around throughout the
rest of the album. — - j

Next up is “Won’t Want For Love.” This
is the first time we hear “Margaret”, — or
Becky Stark of “Lavender Diamond” —
singing. Other guest stars soon follow suit,
and overall, they’re welcome additions. Shara

I , . Worden, the evil queen, is an especially good

bluesy antagonist. Just listen to “The Wanting
Comes In Waves.”

The album also packs a few musical ‘sur-
prises,‘though not as many as in previous

records. For instance, a romantic accordion T

is heard ﬂoating softly through “Isn’t It a
Lovely Night?” and a country—like steel gui-
tar penetrates the melodies of many songs
at random. _ F‘.

As epitomized in “Wandng,” the music

comes in waves, alternating between°peace-_

ful acoustic and evil blues—rock, and always
maintaining a delicate emotional balance for

the listener. Often, the music will even-shift
mid—song, as one singer — or character —-
steps in, with his or her own musical con-
notations. « V

This brings about the subject of the

not-so-good part of this album. If you’re A

someone who needs to know what a song
is about, you’ll probably ﬁnd yourself con-
stantly straining to understand the plot line,
which can get a bit irritating —' or irascible

particular, don’t work.

It’s not helped by Meloy writing songs in I

ye olde English. _
In previous albums, such ﬂowery language
was cool, but here The Decemberists seems

to be overdoing it. For example, take the —

tongue—twister, “The prettiest whistles won’t
wrestle the thistles undone”.

It comes down to this: The Decemberists
is still a great band with arfimpressive ability

and imagination. But because T/ye Hazard: of M

Love is so absorbed in the meticulous dicta-
tion of a storyline, the music becomes harder
to engage with, and ,the"album comes off
feeling a bit artiﬁcial. A ‘ A
Sure, have guest stars, but don’t have plot-
driven duets. Please, tell stories, but don’t
let them overshadow the music itself. The
Decemberists wasn’t careful and it alienated
the audience. Maybe that is the real hazard.

Pitt heatinjuries to advance to Sweet 16

Sarah Wnski / Senior Staff Photographer

ShavtxmeZellom(lel't)ann:lJaI1iaSins._

by Sergei Feldmani‘ _
Staff U7/'iter_

Days after Pitt’s Sweet 16 loss to
the Oklahoma Sooners, a bitter taste

remains in the mouths of the Pitt-
‘ women’s basketball team.
But the season also had_many.

“Remarkable,” saidgsenior guard
Xenia Stewart of the season. ‘The
way we’ve been able to overcome
adversity, it said a lot about our
team.”

Pitt faced adversity from the sea-
son’s earliest moments, when junior
guard Jania Sims went down with a
season-ending  during the first
game. Freshman center Kate Pop-
ovec also fell victim to 

i~ While naysayers may have clues-

tioned the team’s ability to persevere
through ‘those injuries, especially at  P

the point guard position, there was

no such  among the players
on the court.

"W/e  no .1-_etdoWnSi,” saidiiiii

Stewart “We -basically played point
guard by committee and took it "one
game at a time.” ,

The approach proved success-
ful,ias the team advanced to a sec-
ond consecutive Sweet 16 run in the

‘ NCAA Tournament.

Along the way, the team captured
its best—ever record, All—American
honors and builtupon a reputation
of success. What stood out for head
coach Agnus Berenato was character.

“It was a terriﬁc season and we g

~overachieved,”, she said. “No one

expected much from us with allthe
injuries, but we came together and
accomplished a lot It’s a true testa-
merit to our team’s character.”

S ' Stewart agreed with Berenato

and pointed to two deﬁning games ‘

of the season, a loss to Louisville in
the Big East tournament and a vic-
tory over Gonzaga in the NCAA
Tournament.

"The ﬁght we had against Lou-g

isville was unlike any other time all

season,” said Stewart. “Many people

may not have seen it, but we played

' to win, we wanted it bad and we re-

ally competed. It sent a message that
you can’t take us lightly”
Then Gonzaga tiied and failed.

' “‘We made big plays and played,

_our hardest ever,” she said of the
game‘ against Gonzaga. “The en-
ergy was something else. If we play
next season like we played in those

two games, well be a force to be

reckoned with.”

Incidentally, Stewart’s prediction
coincided with Berenato’s goals for
the future. .

“My goal isn’t to build a great
team. My goal is to build a great
program,” said Berenato.

As long and tough as the season

was, Pitt found a way to balance
work with fun along the way.

“There’s not much of a social life i

[as_ a student-athlete],” said Stewart.
“But when we’re not on the court,

_ we’re a close team and like to have

fun.”

This same thing hppend

, just a few months ago: A‘ star Pitt
A player shined just a little too much

for comfort during the season,
bringing up the option to play
professionally. Pittsburgh media
buzzed and Pitt fans freaked.
Then, it was LeSean McCoy.

iiNow, it’s Dejuan Blair.

Like they did in January when
McCoy was leaning toward the
Draft, Pitt fans are talking about
how Blair needs to stay in col-

liege to improve his game, better

his Draft stock and leadPitt to

_ a championship. But guess what,

Pitt fans? Blair gave you all the

time he needed to. And like Mc- '

Coy did just months ago, it’s time
,for Blair to take the next step.

_ There’s not much question
about it, Blair needs to say good-

bye to Pitt. Not because the Pan-
thers won’t be able to use him

-next season + he’ll likely be the

Big East’s best player if he returns
—— but because the opportunity
he .has at the next level is just too
good to pass up. I

Blair is ranked among the top- 

20 NBA prospects by nearly all
the Draft services and could im-
prove that ranking by  good
workouts at NBA camps. Even if

he stays in the 15 to 25 range, it’ll

be worth going.

D~on’t pull that he-won’t-make-

will make more than $1.2 million. What will i

Blair make at Pitt? Nada.

Of course, .it’s notjust about the money.
Guys need to play for the love of the game,
and that’s understood‘. But money still has
some importance, right? '

Then there’s that other thing. Like how
some people say leaving early can hurt a
player. Yeah, a lot of times those people
are right. Chris Taft, for example, is one
of those players who made the mistake of
leaving too early. The ex—Pitt center left af-
ter two seasons only to flop in the NBA
and, well, fall off the face of the earth.

- People will bring -the Taft comparison
when talking. about Blair, too. But Blair has
what Taft lacked. He has a great attitude,
a great work ethic and the essentials that
make professional basketball players suc-A
ceed.- His ‘hands might be the best in the
game right now, and his agility goes un-
matched. _ ~

Still, there’s no way he"s~ completely
tapped into his potential. Can his jump
shot improve? Deﬁnitely. Can his ball—han-
dling get better? Of course. I-lis free—throw

shooting? No question, it needs work. Blair‘

needs a free throw coach, an outside jumper
and better skills when itcomes to defend-
ing on the perimeter.

But why does he have to do it incol-.

lege? Can’t he work on those things at the

next level?

In the NBA, Blair will get a chance to

focus solely on basketball. He’ll have the
best people coaching him, and he’ll be sur-
rounded by the world’s most talented, most
developed players. Because of that, he’ll
improve quickly.

Here’s the" thing: Pitt fans want Blair
back next ‘season, and college‘ basketball
fans want Blair back next season. He’s fun

April 6, 2009

Work effort and attitude
separates Blair from Taft  

to watch and he brings excitement to the
game. Not only that, but Blair will make
Pitta top-20 team once again next year.
Imagine him playing in the post with Dante
Taylor. Mmmmm, that would be fun. _

' -But that doesn’t mean it’s the right move
for him. _ _

So many people talk about how a cer-
tain player. should act and what they should
decide on when it comes to'their profes-
sional career. But those people have no idea
what it’s like to be in that situation. They
don’t know what $1.5 million smells like
and what it can do not only for the indi-
vidual, but for that indiVidual’s family. If
Blair stays, he’ll likely be a higher pick 
sign an even bigger contract. But who’s to
say he’ll be healthy after next year? He’s had
a history of knee trouble at Pitt and tore
both of his ACLS in high school. So if he
turns the wrong way oi: comes down hard
after a rebound against Providence next
season and can’t play again,iwhat’s hego—
ing to do? '_I'here’s insurance he can get, but

_, that doesn’t ensure him a spot in the NBA.

Nothing does,‘except for the option of en.-
tering the Draft now. V
He’s started both years, leading the

Panthers in reb’ounds.- He shared~Big East 7

rookie—of—the-year honors, then earned Big
East player-of-the-year honors a season
later. He helped bring Pitt to its ﬁrst-ever
No. 1 ranking, it’s first-ever No. 1 seed in
the NCAA Tournament and also won a Big
East tournament championship. He’s dom-
inated Hasheem Thabeet. He’s pulled down
double—digit rebounds in Big East play.
He’s done more in his two years 
most people expected him to do in four.

Some people expect him to do the same

thing next year for Pitt. But the problem is,
those people shouldn’t. .
