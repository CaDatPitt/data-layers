For Officers
‘Faculty Ballots Hold

Greater Importance
In Groups’ Election

By Paul Teske -

Election of officers of two ma-
jor student government groups
at the University will take place
tomorrowevening as new mem-
bers of the assembly of the Stu-
dent—Faculty Association and of
Men’s Council meet for their re-
spective internal balloting.

It is expected by some that the
‘votes of the ten faculty members
in the SFA assembly will be im-
portant factors in selection of the
officers and executive committee
this year more than ever before.

Independents, with only 11 stu-
«dent votes this year, can succeed in
electing oﬁicers only with the aid
-of faculty members. They are con-
«(ceded little chance to win the
unanimous support of the faculty
members, and are therefore expect-
ed to come out of the elections with
«only the vice presidency.

Executive Split Likely

The Independent representation,
however, will probably guarantee
three representatives on the exec-
utive group. Fraternities will have

an equal number of members on‘

the committee.
Newly-elected members of the

assembly will participate in the vot- ‘
mg. They will select six students,-

four men and two women, to form
the executive committee. The new

committee_ will then draw up .a_list_

of nominees for president, secre-
tary, and treasurer". " Two will be
selected -for each position, and the
vice president will be the defeated
presidential .candidate._,_ . I
Hoeveler’s Motion,   
One of the ﬁrst motions that the
new assembly is expected to act_up-
on is "the amendment proposed‘ by
Jack Hoeveler, C40, vice president,
to have the executive committee
elect its own officers internally, in-
stead of-the present method of hav-
ing the entire assembly vote upon
the nominations. This proposal was
reported favorably by the investi-
gating committee but no action was

Fine Arts Exhibition

Gallery Shows Books, Lithographs

By Anita Barone
Appearing now in the Fine Arts gallery are two exhibits: the ﬁrst is

a series of books illustrating the history of printing and commemorating ’

the ﬁve-hundredth anniversary of theﬁrst printed book‘ the second ‘is an

exhibition of lithographs.

Included in the book exhibit are
examples from the ﬁfteenth cen-
tury up to the twentieth century.
Some of the famous examples are:
the Cologne Chronicle from the ﬁf-
teenth century showing various
types of printing used; and the
Koberger Bible and the Nuremberg
Chronicle which lists events from
the beginning of time up to 1492.

It may be noted that in the
Nuremberg Chronicle three pages
‘were left blank for the events that
would happen after 1492, which was
the date of the printing of the
book.

Also of great importance is the
Divine Comedy by Dante, printed
in Florence in the ﬁfteenth century.
This was the first book to have en-
gravings on the same page as the
type. The illustrations were re-
putedly done by Botticelli, and the
book itself is printed in Italian.

There are examples from Ger-
many, Italy, France, Holland, Eng-
land, and America. Two of the
American examples are: Modern
Chivalry, first book printed west of
the Alleghenies and printed in
Pittsburgh in 1793; and a book by
Benjamin Franklin.

The books were loaned for the
exhibit by Mrs. Roy A. Hunt, Dr.
Audrey Avinoff, assistant professor
of ﬁne arts, Walter Leuba, Darling-
ton library, Fine Arts library, and
the Grolier club, New York.

The lithograph exhibit includes
works of experimenters as well as
the works of some very famous
artists, such as: Ingres, Delacroix,
‘Whistler, Degas, Daumier, and Goya.

Lithographs were ﬁrst used as a
type of cartoon in the early news-

papers in France principally for po- ‘

litical satire and ‘caricatures. Then

 

it was taken up by the noted artists
of the time and it became an art.

The lithographing process can be
used to stimulate a number of me-
dias and can achieve a variety of
effects, more than any other process
can.

Both exhibits will continue until
May 29.

alcove overlooking Lilly Court.

Although ﬁnal plans have not
been completed, Halloran inti-
mates that dedication of the
annual senior memorial will take
place sometime before Commence-
ment. ’

Enclosed in the letters sent to
seniors were pledge cards so word-
ed that sums promised will be de-
ducted from cap and gown refunds.
Seniors who desire to contribute
immediately may send their contri-
butions to the dean of men’s office,
809 Cathedral, or to a member of
the committee, Halloran said.
Artist Designs

Designed by Charles J. Connick,
stained glass artist who painted
the windows of the Heinz Chapel,
the medallion casement windows
will symbolize two aspects of
springtime “with accent upon the
masculine and the feminine atti-
tude.”

“The suggestion of animals re-
lated to hunting and fishing, and
the sports, track, and baseball, is
balanced by the feminine sugges-
tion in relation to birds, flowers,
and slender growing things,” Con-
nick stated when asked to sum-
marize the symbols in the stained’
glass. — ‘

“These ideas are also“ comple-
mented by small incidental designs
throughout the ﬁeld,” continued

Connick, “which will be in tints of

transparent glass.” _

many suggestions.
After meeting with the faculty
advisers, Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,

and
received

‘ ald, provost, the committee, which

was chosen by SFA, decidedupon
the easement windows because they

could be ﬁnished before commence-

sive.”

Roy H. Umble, instructor in Eng-.
lish, is the third member of the
speech department to become a
father in the last six weeks. His
pride is a baby girl, Janet, born
last Monday.

It was Mr. Umble who a few
weeks ago complained about an
item in Pittpourri which did a bit
of Walter Winchelling in announc-
ing that he already was a father.

Buell“ Whil?€h‘lll, ' assistant -profes-

Capture Race,
Float Prizes

Winners in the Interfraternity
sweepstakes and Float parade stag-
ed Friday afternoon were announc-
ed at the Senior Ball that evening
by Sam Carnarata, C40, chairman
of Spring Festival week.

Satirizing everything political
from “third term” Roosevelt to
“labo-rite” Perkins, the 13 women’s
fraternities paraded before a Bay-
ard street audience. The Alpha Ep-
silon Phi ﬂoat, a takeoff on the Gal-
lup poll, was declared best among
the group by the judges.

Kappa Alpha Theta ﬂoat was giv-
en second place for originality and
Delta Zeta came in for honorable
mention.

In the sweepstakes races, the Phi
Gamma Delta entry was awarded
first prize for their fast time of
two minutes, 43.5 seconds. Run-
ning a close second after losing a
tire at the corner of Tennyson and
Bayard streets, the Delta Tau Del-
ta machine crossed the ﬁnish line
in two minutes, 44 seconds.

Cups were also awarded to the
Fraternity group for “pulling” more
than the Independents in the tug
of war battle last Tuesday, and to
the class of 1941 which came out
first in women’s sports.

Chemistry Professor

Discusses Azeotropy

‘Dr. Wojciech Swietoslawski, vis-
iting professor of chemistry, will
discuss “General Aspects of Azeo-
tropy,” the ﬁfth in his series of
seven lectures, in 302 Thaw Hall to-
morrow afternoon at 4:30 o’clock.
All interested persons are invited.

by the Pitt News and the Student Health Service, the drive

will seek to “end the dread of hospital bills” by a voluntary insur-
ance plan that will provide extensive hospital beneﬁts for member
students.

All regularly enrolled undergraduate students will be eligible
to participate in the group plan, which will be launched at ‘the Uni-
versity with the cooperation of the Hospital Service A.ssoc1at1on.of
Pittsburgh. This organization 1s a non-profit, community enterprise
sponsored by some 70 leading hospitals 111 Western Pennsylvania.

The campus drive will get under way Wednesday when students will
be given an opportunity to express their interest in theplan at a g1‘0111’1d
ﬂoor booth, where a detailed description of the hospitalization scheme
will be available.

Under a plan drafted late last week by the Hospital Service asso-
ciation in cooperation with the News and Student Health Service, the fee
for student membership in the plan will be $2.50 each semester. This
money will be collected by the University at registration, when students
will sign applications for the hospital service.

Valuable Services Listed

Students who register for the service will be insured throughout the
semester against hospital bills and will be granted hospital admission at
any time during the semester upon the approval of Dr. H. C. Carlson, di-
rector of the University Student Health Service.

The following speciﬁc services are incorporated under the plan:

(1) Room and board in ward accommodations for a total of 21 days
each school year in any of Pittsburgh’s 25 largest hospitals. The student
may select accommodations in semi—private or private room with an al-
lcowance of $3 per day toward the purchase of these better accommoda-

1.0118.

(2) "Use of the operating room as often as necessary.

(3) Anesthesia as often as necessary (if administered by a salaried
employee of the hospital). . = .

(4) Ordinary drugs and medications.

. (5) Necessary dressings and casts.
(6) Routine laboratory services. ~ v - l
(7) Ordinary X-ray. ' ' 1

These‘ extensive services will not only be available to students‘ while"

in the Pittsburgh district, but out-of-town emergency and accident care, '-

as well, in any hospital on this continent or abroad will be provided
throughout the school year. ‘Liberal maximum rates’ payable by the Hos-

pital Service association for hospital care anywhere will be speciﬁed in" ‘

student contracts.

Only four types of cases will not be accepted for hospitalizatidh under ' V

the adopted scheme. These cases are: pulmonary tuberculosis, mental dis-

orders, veneral diseases, and contagious diseases .when’(nqt.l_acceptablfe, 

the general hospital of the student’s choice. A

The Hospital Service-associ.ation, which cooperated ‘with University
representatives in drawing up the first ‘university ‘hospitalization plan in
the country, is supervised by the State Department of Insurance and is
endorsed bythe. American Hospital association. , » l ' V

Already ﬁfty-six similar organizations throughout the United States
now offer hospital service on the same non-proﬁt plan that will be initiated
here this week.

Wide Choice of Hospitals  

During/the past year, the nationwide movement accounted for approx-
imately $25,000,000 in hospital care. With unlimited facilities for hospital-
ization at.'his command .the participating association member is free to
choose the participating hospital which he desires to enter. Student ad-
mission is, however, contingent upon the approval of the director of the
Student Health Service.

Participating hospitals in this district include Allegheny General,
Braddock General, Children’s, Columbia, Elizabeth Steel Magee, Eye and
Ear, Homestead, McKeesport, Mercy, Monteﬁore, Ohio Valley General,
Passavant, Pittsburgh, Presbyterian, Roselia Maternity, St. Francis, St.

John’s General, St. Joseph’s, St. Margaret’s Memorial, South Side, Shady-
side, Suburban General, Valley, West Penn, and Woman’s hospitals.

The hospitalization movement has been under consideration in Uni-
versity circles for many years although no deﬁnite plan of action was
agreed upon until this week. Discussing the “crusade against unforeseen
hospital expenses,” Dr. Carlson explained Friday that the average student
does not have suﬁicient money to ﬁnance extended hospitalization. He
called attention to the inability of students to pay both college expenses
and sudden hospital demands.

Enthusiastically behind the group scheme, Dr. Carlson said he was
conﬁdent that student response to the program would be immediately forth-
coming. He saw the hospitalization plan as one of the most farsighted ad-
vancements in University history.

Training Season Opens

Cheerleaders to Begin Practice

Four cheerleaders line up facing the Stadium grandstand. Lifting
their .megaphones to their mouths, they plead, “C’mon, let’s go, a big
Alleghenee.” Then, after their arms describe a perfect arc, they crouch,
in tempo to the thunderous yells that are to come. As they spring into
the air, however, all is silence.

That’s the regular late spring
scene at the Stadium where every

begin today.) Coached by Karl
Oermann, instructor in physical ed-

year, the University cheerleaders
undergo a spring training period to
work out maneuvers for gridiron
crowds next fall. It is at these
practice sessions that those difficult
roll—overs, hand-springs, pyramids,
and other stunts which lend color to
autumn’s football games are de-
veloped.

This year, under Richard Sonnen-
feld, C41, recently appointed head

cheerleader, practice sessions will

ucation, this year’s “sideline side-
show” will feature more precision,
more difficult acrobatic feats, and
louder yelling than has been seen

' in former years.

When questioned about next
year’s group of cheerleaders, Clar-
ence Shepard, C40, graduating head
“yardage yowler” for the past year,
said, ‘‘It’s a fine squad, but all I
can say is that I gave the best cheers
of my life to Pitt.”

The Pitt News

Hospital Aid: A New Crusade

The Pitt News has mounted its charger to ﬁght

a crusade. A group hospitalization plan is to be
offered to the students.
This is not an ordinary crusade. For it is not
one whose path is blocked by opposition of any
description. The University, through the Pitt
News and the Student. Health Service, the Amer-
ican Medical association, and most doctors favor
the plan.

The crusade of the Pitt News is directed to-
ward one objective: to make Pitt students con-
scious of the splendid opportunity aﬁordcd them.

There is a deﬁnite need for a hospitalization
program among University students.

Under its present set up, the Student‘ Health
Service can offer only medical attention. This
service comprises only the advice and treatment
normally given by any doctor at his office.

The University has »no- inﬁrma-r_v. -And no hos- .

pita] gives special attentiion-, th-rough rates or ot.her
considerations, to the Pitt man and woman.

Therefore if a student needs hospital care, or
if he needs -emergency hospital treatment, he
usually gets it in Pittsburgh and he always foots
the entire bill himself. That a student or his
parents should be burdened by this additional extra
worry and the debts of a hospital bill is ridiculous
when an opportunity like this is offered.

The student hospitalization plan is the best
answer to the questions of fear and hospital bills.
Practically every hospital in VVestern Pennsylva-
nia. will honor this insurance; a fee slightly over

Wc Welcome Back
llur Honor Roll

Aside from the purely journalistic reason. that
“names make news,” we ’re glad that we published
the 771 names of the honor students in ou.r last.
issue. \Vith our publication of those names comes
the realization that the honor roll., that well-beloved
font of academic publicity, is once more a part of
University tradition.

.Once again for the ﬁrst time in three years,
thanks to the new machinery iii the registrar ’s of-
fice which makes possible the newly-revived honor
list, the-pr.imar_v function of educating, mirrored in
acadelnic achievement‘, will successfully compete
with other University activities in the struggle for
publicity. A i A

For the honor roll is, to a large extent, a pub-
licity device for the often-neglected activity of
studying. As such, the honor list has rendered and
will again render valuable services, especially when
May breezes and spacious lawns claim the erstwhile
scholar’s time and fancy.

Speaking for ourselves, we feel sure that the
mere thought of such a. roll of honor will. help us to
resist the vagrant wisheswhich have led and do
lead us astray from ’1ecture—hall and library.

All _of which prompts us to compliment the reg-

'istrar’s oiﬁce. for the reviving of a “neglected

service.”

The War Brings
l[cad- Scratching

Once again the extension of the European. war

has interrupted the-_normal life. of the American
Collegian. The average collegiate has, during the

past week—end, bought up every edition, and "read .

morethan_sports or Mrs. Roosevelt or society. Once
again.  frantic, ceaseless dialing attempts to ﬁnd
news, at the expense of Kay Kyser or Lang Thomp-
son. College events are fading in importa.nce. The
Tap Day was featured as much by “Is -‘it true . .f,”

“Hay? you heard... .’.’ as by “Congra_tu.lations” or_

“Did Ayouget anyt}1,iJ.,1g?’.’_, The war has even pene-
trated the Tuck Shop.
But American ,students_ are not only worrying

about the invasion of Holland and Belgiuni, they 1

‘are thinking about the course this country should
take. A , y , _

f\‘trangel,v enough, the Norwegian ﬁasco, and
]:n.'o'lr.’-1lil_v,tlie present affair, are not inﬂuencing the
American student in the direction most people
assume. . _ _

A.cco.rding to the latest student opinion survey,
which was taken after Allied failures in Norway,
the trend. of student opinion “has been more and
more against. the U. S. entering the conﬁict. Six
months ago. a Surveys poll }3ointed out that 36 per
cent approved of sending troops against Germany
if the Allies appeared to be losing. Now only 10
per cent. approve.”

This poll will be indicative of “realism” or
“c_vnicism” depending on how the interpreter
stands on the intervention question. To us, the poll
indicates that, cynic or not, the American Collegian
is not being stampeded by the excitement of the
day. For which we are thankful.

50 cents a month during the school year is no great
drain on the students’ pockets.

Group hospitalization is not new. Employees
in educational and business institutions all over
the world have been covered by similar plans; Pitt
faculty and administration members are covered
by the identical plan offered to the students. And
T119)’ are paying; an even higher rate than students
will be charged.

Nor will the Pitt student hospitalization plan
suffer from premature birth. For it is the culmina-
tion of six years of active conta.ct and planning
between the University and several groups spon-
soring such plans. The Hospital Service associa-
tion, which last week was chosen to protect Pitt
students, is a non-proﬁt organization whose mem-
bership includes hospitals all over \\'estern Penn-
sylva-niia. ~

A Because the _p,roposal is a voluntary one," setting
the plan into action awaits only one thing: support

of the Pittstudent body." Tlf1c'Pitt News and the ’

Student" Health Service will sponsor a drive this
week to enroll supporters of the 1novem.en'tf. The
students will only be asked to show their favor of
tl.1e new plan by requesting that they be contacted.

Our crusade thus resolves itself into this re-
quest’: we ask you to read carefully the details of
the hospitalization plan outlined in the paper.

‘We feel conﬁdent that once you realize the acute
need for providing liospital care for Pitt students
and that once you recognize the practical solution
embodied in the group hospitalization plan, there
can be but one response: 100 per cent endorsement
by the Pitt student b'od_v. ‘

In the Mail

A Solution to the Mystery
Of the Missing ‘Razz Rag’
Editor, the Pitt News:

Spring Festival week has passed without the appear-
ance of the traditional “razz rag,” that sheet which
spoofed faculty, students and administration alike. There
ought at least be a public explanation of its passing,
and perhaps a prayer for its return next year.

The razz rag was titled variously during the last few
years, being called the “Pitt Bruise,” the “Royal Pitt,”
and the “Pitch Woos.” It appeared during“ Spring Fes-
tival week, generally on Carnival Night. It was put
together by the executive members of the News staff,
and the News advertising staff helped with the solicita-
tion of ads to pay for the paper. For a time it was given
away free, but last year it was able to sell 700 copies at
ﬁve cents each on Carnival Night.

The paper never pulled its punches, and took every-
one for a ride as long as its editors felt it was deserved.
Last year, with the paper und-er a new adviser, the
"razz rag” was stopped on the presses by his order, and
he refused to allow the News to guarantee the funds
for its support. Finally after much delay, and overtime
costs, the editor and business manager ‘guaranteed and
paidfor the paper. A

This year, .-the executives of the News were given to
understand that the News .:was-not la.1lo.wed to ‘ﬁnancially

sponsor a “rag.”~u There: was, however, no outright re-. .

fusal. This was because the matter was allowed to drag
by those ordinarily responsible for it, until such a time
that a refusalby the paper executives to 'put=out the
“rag” just stymied any other effort whatever.

.In short, a trenchantiphrase to describe just what
happened would be “a lack of initiative and a lack of

guts.” Perhaps it was mainly the lack .of guts.

College Daze
Cooperation Solves One

Of Life’s Little Prolilerns

If you are addicted to reading the Pitt News in
your morning classes you’ll understand the plight. of a
Dartmouth College junior who sat in the last row in one
of his lectures reading a story which began on the first
page and was continued onipage four. He couldn’t lift
the paper in order to turn the pages and he didn't have
room to turn them if he kept the daily down out of
sight.

He sat there for ﬁve minutes trying to turn the
pages slowly so that they wouldn’t crackle and was
just about to give up in disgust when the man sitting
directly in front of him turned and gave him a paper
which was already arranged at page four. The man
in front had already read the story. “Thought you
might be having trouble,” he said. “I had a bit myself.”

Truck Squad Whips Penn State
To Extend Duel Meet Success

News Favors Pitt
Over Ohio State
In Columbus Meet

By Ben Foote

Pitt.’s track team ﬁnally meets
Ohio ‘State tomorrow afternoon
at Columbus in the dual event‘
ori,c;inal1y scheduled for April 20.

Predictions for this aﬁ".air are
made without the help of the
Penn State results, but with even
some conservatism, the News can’t
see Pitt doing any worse than a
75-56 victory. In Big Ten track
ratings, the Buckeyes must‘ be
ranked third behind Michigan and‘
l.n,glian‘a, . respectively, and the
Panthers trimmed the Hoosiers,-
72-59.

In past meets this year, the quar-
ter mile has featured the running
program, and tomorrow’s encounter
Frank

should prove no exception.
Ohl, the veteran ' ’
speedster, toes

the starting line

with Jack Sulz-

man, runnerup

in the Big Ten

outdoor cham-

pionships last

spring.

On the basis
of Ohl’s per-
formance against ‘
Roy Cochran,
the Indiana ﬂy-
er. Sulzman
would get the V
nod for the l'avor— Ohl
ite’s role. but a good man can’t be
kept down, and the Pitt senior has
never exactly looked bad. After
witnessing both boys in the Penn
Relays, although they didn’t run
against each other. the News prog-
nosticator thinks Ohl should emerge
the victor.

Other Ohio State stars who can
make trouble for the Panthers in-
clude Les Eisenhart, miler and
half-miler deluxe, Steve Linta, Big
Ten Indoor pole vault champ, and
Don Scott, weight star and fugitive
from the Buckeye grid team.

However, in each of the tests
where Larry Snyder’s outﬁt is
strongest, coach Ol.son’s squad
boasts equal strength. Al Boulang-
er should furnish Eisenhart his
match in the mile, but the latter
must be cast slightly above Del An-
derson, junior half miler.

Dusty Rhoades took Linta’s meas-
ure in the Penn Relays pole vault
and the Buckeye leaper hasn’t got
over it yet. Johnny Bazyk, husky
shot putter and discus thrower,
should give Scott all the competi-
tion he can handle.

Baseballers Lose

State Nine, 6-4,

Although Pitt’s diamond forces
took it on the chin for the seventh
time in eight starts, they almost
upset the dope bucket as the high-
ly touted Penn State nine copped
a 6-4 verdict from Big Ben Kish,
at the Stadium Saturday afternoon.

Coach Joe Bedenk, the Lion
mentor, had to summon his ace
moundsman, Ed Bastian to the hill.
to pull the victory. out of the ﬁre
in the ninth -inning." After whilﬁng
12 Panthers, Letfy Richardson,
lanky state forkhander, suddenly
lost control in the last half of the
final stanza and walked Ed Hal-
uska, Eddie Jones, Frank Goelz,
and pinch hitter Ernie Bonelli in
succession.

The orthodox Bastian, who has
yet to drop a collegiate decision,
rushed to the mound. and Panther
tutor Ralph l\/iitterling countered

Three Times

In Two Days
Victims of an upset in the "only

match they were supposed to win.,

the Pitt golf team are closeto the

cellar of the Eastern Inter-collegiate
Golf association“ today after suf-

fering three consecutive defeats
over the week-end.
The Panthers were odds-on

favorites to whip Pennsylvania Fri-
day in one of the early matches of
the two day Middle Atlantic sec-
tion championships at Oakmont,
but the Quakers cleaned up in their
final foursome and won. 5-4.

Two individual and two four-
some victories weren’t enough for
a Pitt triumph, since number one
man Bill Kramer lost to Penn’s
George Bunnell, 3 and 2, and Bill
Reilly dropped his first league
match of the year to Harry Cros-
son of Penn, 1 down.

Saturday the Cathedral links.-
men bumped into Georgetown and
Princeton, losing 8-1 and 9-0, re-
spectively. Jim Kennedy scored
the only Pitt victory when he edg-
ed out Dick Harris 1 up after 19

holes. Georgetown, eventual win-
ners of the tournament, breezed
+hi~nucrh the other rounds. Kramer

had the ,tou.<>‘h luck to draw John
Burke. national collegiate cham-
pion. and Burke was an easy 6 and
5 victor.

A iurraled lineup was of little

When. the 220 yard low hurdles,
mile relay, -discus, and hammer,
throw still remained on the pro-
fram, Pitt held a scant 55-53 mar-
gin. Versatile Mr. Ewell shed his
sweat suit to line up ‘at the low
hurdle starting line; State was con-
ceded three places in the hammer:
Vukmanic’s husky frame loomed
up dominantly at the discus ring.
The mile relay looked to be the
deciding factor.

However, Pitt suddenly turned
the contest into a routt. Werner
withdrew Ewell from the barrier
race to save him for the anchor leg
in the mile relay. Blue and Gold
clad timber toppers Hap Stickel
and Joe Newman then breezed to
ﬁrst and second places respective-
ly, the winning time 24.4 seconds.

In the mile relay, Al Ferrara led
off and opened a ten yard gap over
Van Hartman of State; Del Ander-
son stretched this lead to 25 yards
and Larry Tregoning added 15
more. With anchor man. Ohl whiz-
zing around the first turn 45 yards
in front, Ewell saw that it was a
lost cause.

Widening the Pitt margin, Ted
Konetsky and John Bazyk captured
one-two honors in the discus. and a
hitherto unknown, Tom Johsnon,
grabbed a surprise second in the
hammer throw.

We Review the Truck Situation

THERE HAS BEEN much clamor from the track
ﬁends in this part of the country for increased interest,
increased newspaper publicity for the sprinters, distance
men, shot putters, javelin tossers, etc. 

The track and ﬁeld advocates point to the success of
the sport in New York city, in the Mid-West, and on
the Paciﬁc coast, and reason that if track can hold
spectator interest in sections of the United States, it

can do so in Western Pennsylvania.

Their argument, all other things being equal, sounds
logical, but we feel that they may have overlooked a

trict colleges, for we know little about the manner in
which track is conducted at those schools, but we can

speak from experience at Pitt.

In the first place, to sustain interest in track, it must
At Pittsburgh it can not be
No indoor track exists in
the city, unless you want to call the track house proving
grounds a track, and the public has generally given out-
door track a chilly reception during the winter months,
Consequently, track in Pittsburgh must built its pop-
ularity in the spring. This has given rise to a peculiar
situation. In order to create interest in track, a tremen-
dous build-up is necessary. University athletic ofﬁcials

maintained on such a basis.

With Bill McElwain

when crowds at local meets are almost non-existent.

I Without spending money to dramatize track, the Uni-
versity can expect only small crowds. With small.
crowds, there is no apparent justiﬁcation for spending
the money. The problem becomes increasingly import-
ane every year, for University cinder teams are steadily
carving out a large niche in the hall of the nation’s great
squads.

We can propose no sure-ﬁre solution to the problem.
Perhaps the long-awaited ﬁeld house with_ a ﬁrst rate
indoor board track would be the answer. Unfortunately,
there is a slight matter of securing enough money to
build the field house, a requirement which at the mo-

ient is still not attended to. The money is just not to
be had.

In the meantime we suggest one possible alternative.
Make the meets more interesting.

Under the present system of running off track meets
there are long, dull gaps between events. Instead of
having one event ready to go as soon as another is ﬁn-
ished, the starters are not lined up until the previous
event has been completed.

Perhaps it is impractical to think of eliminating
trac.-k’s most objectionable time-wasting device, but it
might make the fans more interested. At least it would
be worth considering.

offs which left only two teams, one
representing the sophomore class,
and the other the senior class. In
the singles tournament Joy Hart-

In the concluding match of a
short Eastern trip, Pitt’s tennis
team clashes with George Wash-
ington university at Washington, D.
C., this afternoon. _

The capitol city netters who have
impressed observers with their out-
standing play on Eastern clay, are
heavily favored to capture today’s
encounter, mainly because of a
strong, experienced crew of bats-
men.

Johnson Stars

Leading the capitol sextet is Dave
Johnson, one of the better players
on the Atlantic seaboard. Johnson
is second only to Gil Hunt, a high-
ranking national net luminary, in
Washington, D. C. ‘Last year‘ John-
son comprised one-half the tandem
which captured the National Indoor
doubles championship.

In last spring’s campaign Pitt suf-
fered a smashing!)-0 defeat at the
hands of the Washington racquet-
wielders. and while the Panthers
are eager to make a better showing
today, their chances of capturing
even one engagement of the nine to
be played are slim.

Pitt’s usual lineup of Joe Kris-
tufek, Ed Goehring, Francis Har-
muth, Frank Gaenger, Bob Martin,
and Dudley Weiss will face the op-
position, but the order of positions
remains in doubt.

Lose to Allegheny

Last Tuesday the Panther netters
traveled to Meadville, Pa., to play
Allegheny’s courtmen, but were
forced to accept the short end of a
5-4 score. Several matches were
very close, with the ’Gators usually
enjoying the advantage.

In the deciding match, Pit.t’s
number three doubles team. com-
posed of Weiss and Gaenger, lost to
Flint and Blank, 6-8, 8-6, 8-6,
after twice being within a single
point of winning. At one stage of
the match. the Panther duo l.ed 8-6,
5-4, 40-5, but faltered just long
enough to be nosed out.

Kristufek had some diﬁiculty get-
ting pastlTopper, but managed‘to
win out in a lengthy two-setter.
10-8, 10-8. McEwen defeated
Goehring, 6-2, 6-2; Gratz tripped
Harmuth, 6-3, 6-3: and Sauver won
over Gaenger, 6-4, 6-4. However,
the lower end of the lineup came
through. with Martin beating Blank
6-1, 6-4, and Weiss taking Car-a-
vacci, 6-4, 6-4.

Navy Wins, 9-0

In the doubles, Topper and Gratz
nosed, out Kristufek and Nickeson,
8-6, 6-8, 6-4; I-Iarmuth and Goehr-
ingv breezed past 1_\/IcE.w,en and Cara-
vacci, 6-4, 6-2; and Flint and Blank
fought their way to 6-8, 8-6, ,8-6

ern trip, the Panthers dropped an

Freshmen Get
Physical Ed
Examinations

Under the direction of Cecil Mor-
gun, instructor in physical educa-
tion, the department. of physical
education is conducting a series of
practical tests for freshman aand
transfer majors.

These tests, conducted on the
same basis as mental aptitude ex-
aminations, will help determinc the
abilities of freshmen in the depart-
1‘-.‘.(-)1‘1'C. The staff gives a variety of
tests: strength for men and women,
agility for women, motor educabi1-
ity for men and women, power for
men, and rhythm, posture and
swimming for men and women.

Although this plan is an innova-
tion in the University physical edu-
cation department, all tests are
standard examinations woiked out
by nationally prominent men in the
ﬁeld.

Recommendations for continuing
in physical education will be based
on the ﬁndings of the tests. 1

Betty Henry
Receives $2,000
Music Award

A red letter day in the life of
Betty Henry, C42, was May 4, for
on that day she lost a $20 prize in a
singing contest in the morning and
won a $2,000 scholarship in the aft-
ernoon.

Miss Henry, a member of the
Heinz Chapel choir andChi Omega
social fraternity, competed in the
Young Artists’ contest sponsored
by the State Federation of Music
Clubsand failed to win the ﬁrst
prize of $20. She had just reached
her Wilkinsburg home and ﬁnished
telling her mother the bad news
when the telephone rang. .

The call was from Mrs. Martha
Murdock, president of the State
Federation who asked Miss Henry
if she could come to the Hotel
Schenley immediately to sing for a
committee.

Puzzled and nervous Miss, Hen-
ry hurried back to Oakland and
sang before a committee; an hour
later she was notiﬁed that she had
won a $2,000 scholarship given by
an unknown donor. That evening
she had dinner with Guiseppi Agos-
tlni, well—known Philadelphia voice
instiuctor, who will be her teacher
for the next two years.

Short-Circuit English
Croueli, Manning Finish Study

For Benefit of Westinghouse

A "Engineers of the Westinghouse
‘Electric and Manufacturing com-
pany will benefit by a study just
completed by Dr. W. George Crouch,
assistant professor of English and
M, L. Manning, research’ engineer
and secretary ofthe educational
cimmittee, Sharonplant of the
Westinghouse company. i ‘
 As a result of their study, the two
men have produced “Is Your Eng-
li.'*~h~ fshgort-Circuited?” This resume
o English has ben accepted by the;
Sbciety for the Promotion_,of Engi-
n.'ee,ring_,Education,§ and will be pub-1
liiahed in*'the Journal of the society.‘
‘§'I‘he paper will also be read at
the summer convention of the so-.
c ety in Berkeley, Cal. The West-'
-i_ ghouse company is circulating
reﬁpies among its departments, and»
-is -publishing an abstract in “Our
lLetters,” house organ." 2 ’ 
“The need of an adequate knowl-
etlge of English,” the authors say,
“Lia often realized by the engineer
om'-ltr.a:ftei- he has been working in
ittdustry for several years. To meet
fills need, »'a ...post,-,g,ra;.d1-{tattle course in
E.ng.l‘ish, both written ‘and oral, is
suggested.”

What does the graduate engineer
need to know about English and
how may a course in English for
graduate engineers be arranged to
satisfy this need?

The study, called “short circuit
analysis,” deals with faults in bus-
iness correspondence, flaws in the
engineering report, ‘defects in the
writing and presentation of technic-

al papers, limitations in vocabu-
lary, and “burn-outs” in public
speaking.

Dr.~ Crouch has been teaching a
course. in English for engineers at
Sharon duringvthe present year. He
is. a graduate of the University with
A. B., and M. A. degrees and has
been a member of the faculty since
1925. M -

Scientist Talks
To Engineers

Raymond Szymanowitz, technical
director of the Acheson Colloids
C01‘Doration of New York, discussed
the industrial application of colloid-
a1 graphite before chemical engi-
neering students Thursday:

Mr. Szymanowitz was associated
with the late Dr. Edward G. Ache-
son, one-time resident of Pittsburgh,
who is remembered for his discov-
ery of carborundum. . -

The lecturer discussed the re-
searches of Dr. Acheson and ex-
plained the steps leading to Ache-
son’s discovery of a commercial
method of colloidalizing el,ect1;ic
furnace graphite. '

_ This unique method, he. said, en-
yoys a wide use in industry, play-
ing important roles in radio and
television as a special purpose lu-

bricant in high ‘temperature and

wire drawing, as a parting com-
pound, and IS biological research.
