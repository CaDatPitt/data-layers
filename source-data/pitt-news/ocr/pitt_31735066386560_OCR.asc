“She lived a very happy life.”
First heart-liver

transplant survivor
dies at Children’s

By Jim Tezak
News Editor

Stormie Jones, 15, died of
cardiac arrest yesterday morning
at Children’s Hospital, over six
and a half years after she gained
worldwide exposure as the first
survivor of a heart and liver
transplant operation.

Jones, a native of Cumby,
Texas, arrived at Children’s
Hospital early Sunday morning.
She was readmitted to the hospital
because she had been
experiencing a low-grade fever
and sore throat, according to
hospital spokesperson Sue
Cardillo.

“Basically she had ﬂu-like
symptoms, and they weren’t sure
whether it had to do with her
hepatitis or if it was rejection or
what,” Cardillo said.

Jones went into cardiac arrest
approximately nine hours after
she was admitted to the hospital.
Doctors tried unsuccessfully to
resuscitate her for over an hour.
She was pronounced dead at
9:52 a.m.

Jones’ doctors had planned to
perform a liver biopsy to
determine whether her body was
showing any signs of liver
rejection. Cardillo said that
preliminary blood samples
showed thatJones’ liver enzymes
were normal.

According to Dr. Jorge Reyes,

a member of the hospital’s
transplant-surgery team, Jones
had no symptoms suggestive of
heart irregularity.

“She looked like she wasn’t
feeling well. There was absolutely
no strong indication that she was
in major danger,” Cardillo said.

At a press conference yesterday
Reyes said that Jones had been
fully conscious up until the heart
attack. Shortly before going into
arrest, Jones had asked for a glass
of water, Reyes said.

“She was with us 100 percent,”
he said.

Reyes said that there was no
official cause of death as yet. He
said that Jones could have
possibly had a viral or bacterial
infection that weakened her heart
but stressed that the cause of
death would not be known for
several weeks until a full autopsy
report is issued. Officials expect
to have preliminary autopsy
results available sometime
tomorrow.

“She contributed as much to us
as we contributed to her,” Reyes
said. “She lived a very happy
life."

Jones received her initial heart
and liver transplant at Children's
Hospital on Feb. 14, 1984. She
returned to Children’s last
February for a second liver
transplant after experiencing
complications resulting from
hepatitis.

Held for two years in a Chilean concentration camp, Veronica

As a part of Human Rights Week, the Pitt chapter of Amnesty

conscience, who spoke about her experiences under the
regime of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.

DeNegri was imprisoned in 1975 when she began to talk
about the disappearance of her family, friends and other

Santorum win surprises both parties.

By Marietta Pacella
Staff Writer

Democrat and Republican
students on campus have mixed
feelings about the results of last
week’s state elections.

According to Tina Negi, a
representative of Pitt’s College
Republicans, the most notable
race was Democrat Doug
Walgren vs. Republican Rick

Santorum for the 18th U.S.
congressional district, in which
Santorum defeated Walgren with
a close 51-to—49-percent win.

“I expected him to lose at first.
It is usually really hard to get rid
of incumbents, and he had very
little money to work with in his
campaign. But when I watched
the computer ticker and saw he
was ahead in the very beginning
by a couple hundred votes, I

knew he was going to win,” said
Negi.

According to Negi, the College
Republicans did a great deal of
volunteer work for Santorum by
helping with his mailing and going
door—to—door in support of his
campaign.

“When I saw Walgren concede
after a 4,100 vote gap, I felt that
all of our efforts were really worth

Group says mea’z'a a’z'sz‘orts Israel

By Debbie Lincoln
Staff Writer

The international media’s bias
against Israel was the topic of the

Masada/Students for Israel
meeting held Thursday night in
Forbes Quadrangle.

“’Ihere’s a double standard [in
the media] in my opinion,” said
Marc Reiter, president of Masada.
“We want to educate people about
what’s really going on."

The club’s first activity centered
around Israel and the Media, a
documentary which provided
insight into the journalistic
coverage of Israel.

Reiter said the motivating factor
behind the formation of Masada
was a lack of positive Israeli
consciousness on campus. The
video introduced several articles,
from both American and
European newspapers, as
examples of inaccurate or

misleading statements about
Israeli policies and leadership.
One example showed how
newspapers may incorrectly
identify Arab victims or suspects
as youths in an attempt to gain
more sympathy from the reader.
The video pointed out that often
these youths are the same age as
the Israeli soldiers they come
into conflict with.

Pitt’s oldest club honors Mrs. Posvar at concert

By Marietta Pacella
sum" Writer

The Men's Glee Club celebrated
its 101st annual fall concert with
music for many tastes, ranging
from gospel, classical and
Renaissance pieces to humorous
and upbeat barbershop-quartet
numbers.

The show opened up with the
Pitt alma mater, leading into more
solemn pieces such as “Ave Maris
Stella” by Grieg and moving
quickly into classic pieces such
as “Hallelujah Chorus” from
Beethoven and “Ring de Banjo.”

There were many lighter, fun-
filled moments in the show as
well, starting off with “Hunter’s
Song,” which featured Jim Gay,
Lee Rickard and Paul Zeidman as
drunken hunters.

Also featured was Kevin Beres
with a_solo in “Blow the Man
Down.”

The 8 concert, held Sunday
afternoon in the Frick Fine Arts
Building auditorium, was

Puberty used to examine
differences in gender

By Michael P. King
For The Pitt News

There may be a commonality
in what it means to be a male or
a female, but at the same time,
there are many differences that

exist, according to Anne
Constantinople, a feminist
psychologist.

“No matter how non-sexist an
environment a child grows up in,
there is still part of the brain that
insists on sorting the world into
male and female,” said

" Constantinople. -
Constantinople’s lecture, “The

Development of Puberty and
Gender,” was given on Thursday
as part of the women’s studies
program’s fall events.

Constantinople. is a professor
of psychology at Vassar College
and has done extensive research
in personal development,
masculine and feminine roles and
the post-college development of
the Vassar class of 1935.

“My research is mainly on
gender, but I use puberty to get
there,” she said.

Constantinople said that
studying the roles developed in
puberty offers the best chance to
understand gender differences.

She explained that doing
research on gender roles has so
many contributing variables and
individual case differences that it
could be called a “multi—
disciplinary adventure.”

Constantinople contrasted her
saiéaaé with the science of

geology in that she can’t classify I

human gender roles and behavior

\ in the same way rocks can be

classiﬁed into different types. This
is where the multi-disciplinary
aspect applies.

“We want to say that all human
beings in a certain group behave
the same way, but we can’t do

that,” she said.

Puberty is a biological,
psychological and social event.
All these factors must be
considered when doing research
in that area, she said.

She stressed that no matter how
hard it may be, a systematic
approach must be taken when
dealing with gender and puberty.

“The most fundamental fact of
gender and behavior is diversity, ”
said Constantinople.

She offered many results from
research done by psychologists
such as Pennsylvania State
University’s Richard Lerner and
Ann Peterson, who devised a
scheme of understanding puberty
by considering chronological age,
cognitive mental age and grade
age at school. ,

They also found puberty to be
occurring earlier today than it did
50 years ago because of television
inﬂuencing children to assume
mature roles.

One member of the audience,
clinical psychology graduate
student Cindy March, agreed with
Constantinople.

“When you look at puberty,
you have to see it in a
multi—dimensional way, not just
as a biological event,” she said.

“What [Constantinople] was
saying ﬁts in well with the way a
lot of clinical psychologists think
today," March said.

Elections

it. I was really happy for Rick and

his wife, Karen. Nothing
compares to the fee“.ng of victory,
especially when we directly
helped it to become a reality,”
she said.

“College Republicans has done
a lot for Santorum’s victory. We
really enjoyed it because we
believe in Rick. He’s a good
Republican. He stands for what
we believe in,” she said.

However, though Negi feels
content with Santorum’s victory,
she is unhappy with the defeat of
Barbara Hafer by Bob Casey for
Pennsylvania governor. Hafer
was defeated by 1,048,103 votes,
with 97 percent of precincts

reporting.

“I wish Hafer would have gotten
the office. Thing is, she came off
as having a poor attitude by
speaking poorly of Casey, and to
top things off the Republican
party wasn’t really behind her
because she is pro-choice. She
had a lot going into the governor's
race. It’s a real shame. She is a
really capable woman,” said Ne gi.

Negi is referring to the fact that
Barbara Hafer’s campaign
consistently accused Casey of
mismanaging state finances.
Hafer accused Casey of juggling
the state books to show a budget
surplus at the end of the last fiscal
year on June 30, thereby
concealing the state’s fiscal

problems.
Representatives from the
Campus \X/omen’s Organization

_are also not content with the

election results from a Democratic
and pro-choice viewpoint,
according to CWO co-president
Stephanie Helsel.

“I wasn’t surprised at all, but I
was disappointed. I am a
Democrat, so I didn’t agree with
a lot of what Barbara Hafer was
representing. But as a woman I
am really disappointed and
concerned about Casey’s re-
election because he’s so
adamantly against a woman’s right
to choose what’s best for her
[concerning abortionl,” said
Helsel.

in the video was the fact that
Israeli leaders are generally shown
in U.S. papers to display
threatening and “closed” body
language, while other world
leaders are shown in proud,
confident and even friendly poses.
The implication of this leads the

audience to believe that Israeli

leaders have negative attitudes,

toward their positions.

Senior Daniel Finkle believes
that the media is using the recent
death of Rabbi Meir Kahane to
exploit Jewish radicals.

“The fact that everybody’s
talking about him is another

’\

example of how the media likes
to play on something like this,
where [Jews] have our own
scumbag,” said Finkle.

The video charged that the
media distort facts in an attempt
to present Israel as an aggressor
nation because they believe that
this image will sell more papers.

According toJennifer Baldwin,
a previous co-president of CWO,
the election results may have a
negative effect on women’s rights.

“I had a lot of trouble with the
election as a Democrat. I had
problems with Barbara Hafer,
being that she is a Republican,
but I wanted her in, as she is a
pro-choice representative," said
Baldwin.

“I think Casey’s re-election is
extremely problematic for
women’s rights. Some people
think we can get around it, but I
don’t know if we can,” she said.

From the pro-life point of view
Students For Life is completely
satisﬁed with the outcome of the
election, especially with the

victories of pro-life candidate!
Santorum, Casey and Sen. Jesse
Helms (R.~N.C.), according to
Melissa Collins, public relations-
manager for SFL.

“We are very, very happy with
Bob Casey’s election and also for

Jesse Helms’ re-election in North“

Carolina,” said Collins.

Collins said that SFL worked
for Santorum and Republican
Melissa Hart, who won against
incumbentjohn Regoli for a seat
on the state senate, because they
are both pro-life. They did not
work for Hafer, since she is pro-
choice.

“The majority of us were at hi3~"'

victory party going nuts,” Collins
said.

If the guards didn’t like the
way she answered the
questions, her head was
dunked in one of the
containers.

But the mostbrutal treatment
she experienced was being
raped by the guards.

“Getting raped is one of the
hardest things that can happen
to anybody. I don’t know if
you understand [how hard it
wasl.” She also talked about
nuns and priests being raped
as punishment in Chile as well.

“I took for granted what you
take for granted today,” she

said, pointing to the crowd of
50. “One day you will be
parents .. and you will be
inheriting the world and all of
its positions.”

Held for a period of over a
year, DeNegri feels that the
length of stay in prison isn’t
the issue.

“It's not the time,” she said,
“it’s the fact that your rights
were violated. I was in prison
for several months; my son
was tortured for 10 minutes,

and now he’s dead.” 3

DeNegri’s son was recently
killed when he was taking
pictures of a protest in Chile.
He was taken by guards and
burned alive.

V7190 taped Noriega?

In December. 1989, the United States invaded Panama
in an attempt to get Manuel Noriega to face charges for
drug smuggling. Now it is possible that the invasion may
all have been for naught.

On Friday the Cable News Network broadcast tapes
that were alleged to be telephone conversations between
Noriega and his attorneys. These conversations were
allegedly taped by the U.S. government and subsequently
leaked to CNN .,

Both state and federal judges tried to ban the broadcast
of the tapes because, they said, it would deny Noriega
any thahxse fer a fair trial. CNN defied the courts and
broadcast the tapes 10 minutes after the original decision
was handed down.

This controversy, however, seems to be a little too
clear-cut. There is the possibility that Noriega’s lawyers
could have taped the conversations and then given them
to CNN in an attempt to show that the government
violated Noriega’s Sixth Amendment rights.

The U.S. government, on the other hand, would also
have its reasons for handing these tapes to the media. For
there are reasons that our government has to keep
Noriega from going to trial.

President Bush dealt with Noriega many times while
Bush was director of the CIA in the 1970s. In fact, the
American government had a large hand in bringing
Noriega to power. 1‘ O

Noriega was one of the largest drug smugglers in
Central America. There is speculation that the United
States ignored drugs exported by Noriega into this
country. ‘

But Noriega got greedy with his exports and wanted to
gain more money from their sales. So he started to export
more and keep more of the profits.

The U.S. government, however, did not approve of
these increased exports and therefore launched a massive

campaign against him. After months of anti-Noriega

rhetoric, the United States invaded Panama and forcibly
removed him from power.

Because of the government’s previous dealings with
Noriega, it is possible that it could feel that he might be
a threat to tell what he knows about the U.S. government’s
involvement with him during his years as a smuggler.
Therefore, it is possible that our government might not
want him to actually come to trial. '

The Panamanian invasion last year was a huge step
toward curbing the drug trade in this country. Because
of this, Bush's reasons for the attack might seem plausible.
But because of this controversy, the efforts of the
government and the lives of 32 U.S. servicemen may just
have been wasted.

DETENTION

I am writing this letter
concerningJeffTatusko’s editorial
from Nov. 7 about Rabbi Meir
Kahane and its misinformation.
Tatusko’s claim that Kahane was
dedicated to a genocide of an
entire religion is clearly inaccurate.
On Nov. 7, The Pittsburgh Press
printed that Kahane was “a militant
rabbi who advocated the
expulsion of Arabs from Israeli-
held territory.” Rabbi Kahane
simply favored a transfer of the
Arabs into neighboring Jordan,
which was promised to the Arabs
from the British as a Palestinian
homeland. [...l After the Six Day
War of 1967, it was recommended
by some Israelis to physically
force the Palestinians into
neighboring Jordan. However,
Moshe Dayan, the head general
of the Israeli armed forces, was
very sensitive to the Arabs and
chose to let them stay in the
occupied territories. The
Palestinians didn’t leave their
property behind like the Tories
and the Germans did.

On, Nov. 5, Rabbi Meir Kahane
was assassinated by El Sayyid A.
Nosair, a devout Moslem. It was
clearly a premeditated murder.
Nosair, drove from New Jersey
into New York for the sole reason
of committing a cold-blooded
murder. Meir Kahane may have
been an extremist, but he never
murdered an Arab. The majority
of Israelis despised Kahane’s
extremism but did not condone
Nosair’s brutal murder. Like Jeff
Tatusko, I was also at the lecture
Meir Kahane gave at Pitt. Although
I do not identify with Kahane’s
extremism, Kahane made a very
clear point that the Arab world is
filled with a bloodthirsty hatred
of the Jewish people. Nosair’s
belligerent action only proved
his point.[...l

Kahane called for expulsion
I am writing in response to the
article “A Tribute to Meir Kahane,”

. ,by Jeff Tatusko, thatappeared in

 

the Nov. 7 issue of The Pitt News.
I feel that there is one important
error that must be corrected. Meir
Kahane’s platform did not call for
all Arabs to be killed; rather, he
Called for all Arabs to be expelled
from Israel. In fact, Kahane had
reached the same conclusion as
Jeff T atusko — that is that Jews
and Arabs will never be able to
live together peacefully in Israel.
Therefore, Kahane felt it best for
Arabs and Jews both that the
Arabs be expelled.

The vast majority of Israelis
(and AmericanJews) rejected this
view, and Kahane was considered
extremist by all. But even
extremists should not be killed

Letters

for their beliefs. Assassination is
never an acceptable way of
resolving differences. If all of the
Palestinians who believe that the
Israelis should be expelled were
to be killed for their beliefs, the
whole Middle East would be
covered in blood.[...l

Cartoon offensive to blacks

“African American Education

for Mental Liberation” seems to
be the appropriate theme for the
times that we are now living in.
Ironically, it appears that African
American faculty and students
are either brain dead or in some
kind of a semiconscious coma.
Why? On Tuesday, Nov. 6, 1990,
The Pitt News ran a syndicated
cartoon depicting African people
as Cannibals concocting a meal of
two European characters who
were simmering in a pot as the
male’s spouse utters a lamebrain
expression.

This writer takes offense to the
deliberate insult that was
disguised as a cartoon rendering,
especially in view of the fact that
the savagery which brought about
the institution of slavery by

stealing us away from our
ancestral homeland[...l

I dare say that the bigoted
buffoons who are responsible for
printing the idiotic illustration
must be from the same primitive
circumstances that brought the
likes of the [Ku_ Klux Klan],
skinheads, neo—Nazis; they are
the personification of Darwin's
theory in reverse.

Such is the nature of the devil-
may-care editorial policy of the
editorial staff of me Pitt News.

Greeks are not lazy

[...] Getting up at 6:30 a.m. to
go out in the cold and beg for
money is not in the least bit lazy.
And the only self-centered part of
the canning scenario was not
mentioned  people like you
who are in their nice, warm cars
driving to work who cannot drop
a quarter in a can for someone
less fortunate than themselves.

[...l The last time I checked, the
Greeks have done more for more
philanthropies than any single
student group. Not only do we
turn our efforts toward raising
money for a single charity every
year during Greek Week (need I
mention $101,000 for St. Francis
hospital last year), we are the
second largest donator of blood
to the Pittsburgh Blood Bank.
Since you are working in the
health field, I would hope that
you understand the importance
of giving blood.[...l

As for our “lack of service” in

‘soliciting funds, well, you have

obviously not attended any Greek
Week events. The sororities and
fraternities prepare for months to
make Greek Week an entertaining
way to raise money. Greek Sing
is open to the public, andl think

Yet another mark in the ‘L’ column

By Ryan Buncher
Sta17‘lVriter

Pitt Coach Paul Hackett couldn’t come up with
a good way to get his team going last Saturday
against the Temple Owls, but he sure came up
with a perfect summation of his team’s
performance.

“It was a live Temple team, and it was a
somewhat comatose Pitt team,” said Hackett of
his squad’s 28-18 defeat at the hands of the Owls
(5-4).

The loss dropped Pitt’s record to 5-6-1 and left
the team with virtually no hope of salvaging
anything this season. The Panthers have only a
meeting with Penn State in two weeks to play out
the ceremonial game for state bragging rights.

According to Hackett, the Panthers’ fortunes
turned for the worse when they were unable to
keep a 34-yard punt from bouncing into the end
zone in the third quarter, with Temple leading 14-
12. Hackett also cited a running-into-the-kicker

penalty on a fourth down and two from the
Temple 28-yard line later in that drive.

“lPunter] Scott Stark did an excellent job. We
could have backed them up [when we were]
down. We gave them life. Then of course, there’s
no excuse for the running-into-the-kicker penalty."

The penalty gave Temple a first down, and it
went on to score a touchdown on a 14-yard pass
from Anthony Richardson to Tim Hornbaker to
make the score 21-12.

Another event that led to the Panthers’ downfall
was a bench-clearing brawl in the first quarter.

With Pitt leading 6-O, Pitt quarterback Alex Van
Pelt was intercepted by Tony Schmitz, who
would have two interceptions on the day. Schmitz
returned it to the 28-yard line, where Glenn
Deveaux stopped him near the Temple bench. A
brawl erupted, involving most of the players on
both teams. Hackett offered an apology after the
game to Temple head coach Jerry Berndt, who
was hurt in the ﬁght.

Dickerson makes
appearance at QB

By Linda Holley

stay Writer

At the start of the 1990 Pitt football season, fans expected to
see Alex Van Pelt at quarterback and Darnell Dickerson eased
into wide receiver. But at Saturday's game against Temple the
reverse happened.

With 55 seconds left in the third quarter, Dickerson lined up
behind center Chris Sestilli while Van Pelt moved over to wide
receiver. Dickerson faked a pass and gained 10 yards for the first
down.

Both Dickerson and Van Pelt said fans can expect to see the
play again, with a few changes. “It’s been in the game plan all
year, but it’s never been the right time to do it, or we couldn’t
get it going. Today [Saturday] we got it going,” said Dickerson.

Van Pelt was not happy with his performance Saturday,
however. The sophomore completed 12 of 25 passes for 193
yards and threw three interceptions.

See Dickerson, page 9 ,

Bright spot...

Curvin Richards passed Craig Heyward on Pitt's All-Time rushing list with a 89 yard afternoon against Temple. He now has 3,160 yards and is second only to Tony Dorsett.

NEW YORK— Big East football. Myth or
reality?

If you speak to conference commissioner
Mike T ranghese, he'll tell you the situation

IJS somewhere between the two extremes.

In fact, the wheels are turning to form an
eastern football alliance — a haven which
ideally will provide lucrative television
contracts, an incentive for local recruits to
ultimately choose an eastern school and a
major bowl at the end of the year.

Since the Big East has never been a
football conference, one may think that

._g:ountless types of studies are being

performed to analyze presently successful
gridiron conferences: Marketing studies,
television negotiation strategies, gate-
receipt policies, etc. ButTranghese believes

that the best strategy is to go with one that
got you to the top: in this case, Big East
basketball.

Ten years ago, former conference
commissioner Dave Gavitt took nine
schools with relatively little in common
and formed one of the most powerful
basketball conferences in the country. He
made television work for his league like
no other, and the tradition lives on today
in Big East basketball.

Tranghese, Gavitt’s successor, thinks he
may need to look no further and may reap
the harvest from the seeds that have
already been sown.

“I believe there are some places in the
Northeast that don't have football that we
can get for football because of what Big
East basketball represents. I think the
interest in Big East football is going to

carry over from Big East basketball,-’.’.

T ranghese said.

Tranghese is convinced that the
formulation of football in the Big East will
bring in a larger segment of football fans
in the general populace. Presently, football
fans in the East ally themselves with a
wide range of teams due to a lack of
conference affiliation — perhaps a state of
frustrated limbo. Big East football may
give these fans a concrete place to channel
their cheers.

“What you've had for years ‘in college
football is similar to what you have in
college basketball. You have all these fans
with no eastern allegiance. You have
Notre Dame fans, Michigan fans. I think a
lot of them are going to identify with the
East once we formulate it in marketing.

“What happened in basketball is exactly
what's going to happen in football; I’m
absolutely convinced of that if people are

‘Tranghese gets the ball rolling with Big East football

committed to doing the right thing,"
Tranghese said.

By “people committed to doing the right
thing," Tranghese is referring to the
universities that would be involved in this
future agreement. The current Big East
schools should have no objections.
Syracuse, Pitt and Boston College are 12-
14-3 this year, with virtually no hopes of
postseason play. If this trend keeps up in
the future, eastern recruits would almost
certainly look elsewhere to play football.
But conference affiliation may change all
of that.

The most highly visible aspects of Big
East football would be the guaranteed
bowl bid and major exposure due to
television contracts, two priceless
commodities which are in danger of severe
underexposure this season. Not one single

Soldiers and Sailors plays host to hardbodies

By Spencer Borisoff
sums Writer

Not even the marble columns
that decorated the stage looked
as solid as the bodies of the 85
amateur bodybuilders who
participated in Saturday's 1990
U.S. Bodybuilding Champion-

ships, held at Soldiers and Sailors —

Memorial Hall.

By the end of the day, however,
the 85 were weeded down to
only four overall champions.

Dave Concannon, from
Massaeequa, N.Y., won the men’s
junior division (22 years old and

under); Charles Buser, from.

Dauphin, Pa., was victorious" in
the men’s masters division (35
years old and UP); Terrance
Bradich, from North Braddock
Pa., placed first in the men’s open
division (all ages); and Sheila
Bair, from Stockdale Pa., walked
away as the women’s overall
champion. Each division in the
competition consisted of separate
classes.

“The competitors fight for first
through fifth place in their classes,
and then the first-place winners
of each class pose down together

to see who wins the overall
division award,”
Tortorice, the promoter and
director of the championships.

According to T ortorice, the

seven judges of the competition
were looking for overall complete
body development, density,
muscularity and proportion.
Michael McCloud, the 1989 all-
natural power and physique
champion in the men’s open
division, said that the judges look
for the five S’s when judging a

competition as well — size,
symmetry, shape, stridation and
separation.

Tortorice commented that the
judges were in for a hard night’s
work because the competition
was tremendously stiff.

“This is the best competition
we ever had,” Tortorice said.
“We’re especially strong in the
women’s ‘competition, and the
men’s division doesn’t get any
better,” he continued.

said Dean _

Jason Hillman/T he Pitt News

Veins were poppin' and muscles a-flexin' at the 1990 U.S. Bodybuilding Championships on Saturday.

McCloud concurred that the
contestants looked outstanding.

The show was sanctioned by
the American Natural
Bodybuilding Conference, an
organization that urges drug-free
bodybuilding. Only members of
the ANBC were eligible to
compete in the “all-natural”
competition.

“Another prerequisite to be able
to compete is a bodybuilder must
have never used any type of
steroid, growth hormone or
bodybuilding—type drug for the
past five years,” Tortorice said. “If
they had used it during that time
period, it could not have exceeded
an experimental stage of 10 to 12
weeks,” he continued.

A non-proﬁt health care facility in downtown Pittsburgh

blossomed in recent years in an
effort to reduce the association
between weightlifting and drugs.
Naturals shows in Pittsburgh,
central Pennsylvania and the
Great Lakes area have all
germinated in recent years.

“Competitors do not want to
take drugs, but they are kind of
forced to because they compete
in contests that are not drug-
tested,” T ortorice said.

The Natural Pittsburgh Show,
which started about three years

ago at the request of local

bodybuilders who claimed that

, they had no natural competitions

in the area, will be held on April
7.

Hard work is at the cornerstone
of any bodybuilding competition.
Ken Studer, a contestant in the
rmasters division, short class, said
that he works out seven days a
week and hasn't been off his diet
in two years.

“I won’t even binge after
tonight, “ Studer said.

McCloud summed up the
tenacious lifestyle of a serious
weightlifter. “It takes a special
-dedication and a s cial person
with a lot of determination to

lbu ild_ their body. You don’t have

:aI lot of free time, don’t get to go
to every disco. You basically
‘work, eat, sleep and go lift. lt’s a

discipline,” he said.

Nationals

By Sharon Kerestes

_ Staﬂ’ Writer

The pouring rain and shin-
deep mud made for less-
than—ideal running
conditions Saturday at Yale
University, where Pitt’s

men’s cross country team I

had hopes of qualifying for
the NCAA Championships.

But Pitt’s runners achieved
their goal despite the
weather and the fact they
ran what Coach Jim Lear
called only an “average
meet.”

“We didn’t exactly set the 9

world on fire this weekend,”
said senior Keith Dowling.
“But we made it.”

Pitt scored 116 points and
advanced to nationals by
placing third in its region

behind William and Mary,

(82) and Georgetown (99).
Penn State was fourth with
123, followed by Navy (176)
and Bucknell (190).

“The guys were a little
disappointed because we
sort of squeaked in,” Lear
said. “But they realized after
we talked that even though
we ran a mediocre race, we
still made it, which means
we’re a pretty decent team.”

What was disappointing
was the fact that the Panthers
lost to the Georgetown
runners after beating them
at the Big East
Championships by 50
points, and Pitt beat Penn
State Saturday by only seven
points, when earlier in the
season the Panthers beat
the Nittany Lions by 48.

But none of that matters
now because unlike Pitt,
Penn State’s season is over,
and the Panthers still have
another shot at Georgetown
at nationals on Nov. 19.

The mid—Atlantic region,
which includes Pitt, ran
along with the New England
region Saturday to score the
IC4A Championship meet.
Connecticut won the team
title,’ and Pitt finished
seventh overall.

Dowling placed third
individually in the regional
qualifying race and
completed the 6.2-mile
course in 31 minutes, 20
seconds. Scott Humphrey
was eighth for Pitt in 31:50;
Mike Formica was 28th
(32:37); Jason Bodnar was
32nd (32:42), and Tom
Swartout was 45th (33:09).

Georgetown’s Steve
Holman won the race in
31:10, and Aaron Pogue of
Army was second in 31:18.

Dowling, who placed fifth
overall in the IC/IA race,

hadn’t been beaten all
season up to this point.

A evening of stale beer, tobacr juice and big engines

In case you missed it, the United States Hot Rod Camel Mud and
Monster Truck Racing Championships were held this past weekend
at the Civic Arena. You’ve seen the commercials —— “The U.S. Hot Rod
presents Bigfoot-foot-foot this Saturday at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena-
arena—arena. Saturday-Saturday—Saturday  “

Well, I got the honor of attending this major sporting event for the
paper. Probably because I’m the only one on the sports staff from the
South —- South Carolina to be exact — unofficially named the “hick
state” where chewin’, spittin’ and noddin’ is the unofficial pastime.

So, I put on my old ﬂannel shirt and my old denim Levi’s, hopped
in my pickup ———I mean the PAT bus —— and moseyed on down to the
Civic Arena where the big thang was happenin’..I found out that, as

I expected, I fit right in.

stayed alive, go to an event like
this. We’re talking more boots than the government issues to its

like this before. If you ever
soldiers here. And the universal hair style was a la ball cap. The entire
arena was haunted by a not-so-pleasant mixture of stale beer (maybe

this was just from the people sitting in front of me) and wintergreen 

chewing tobacco.

The arena itself had undergone major changes. It has gone from an 1
AC/DC concert Wednesday to a hockey game Thursday to the big 1
event this past weekend. Quick work by the Civic Arena staff made

these changes for all of these very important events.

Just in case you were wondering, the Chevrolet “Kodiak” truck 
defeated “Bigfoot” in the monster- truck competition. In the mud 1
racers, “Mud Patrol,” the No. 1 racer in the nation, left the other E

competition in the dust (or is it mud?) with a time of 1.299 seconds.

The object of the mud races is to go through a pit of mud 80 feet A

long in the least amount of time possible. There is one catch,
however. They have to stop 40 feet after the end of the finish line,

or they are disqualiﬁed. One racer failed to yield this policy and ran

right out of the tunnel at the end of the arena and never came back.

Another slammed into the side of the arena wall after sliding sideways Z

in the entire stopping zone. Following “Mud Patrol” was “Gold

Fever,” No. S in the nation with a time of 1.887 seconds; “Expect No :
Mercy” with a time of 1.905; “Shake Me” at 1.979 seconds and “Instant 12
T” at 1.975. You can tell from the titles of some of these cars what kind -

of people this sport caters to.

Also, if you didn’t attend this past weekend’s hoedown, you missed
the “opportunity” to buy $10 tickets for the return of the Camel Mud
and Monster Truck Series on Feb. 22-23. Oh well, I guess you’ll just
have to pay full price or miss feeling the power—power-ower—ower.

Dickerson first emerged for a
‘sneak play in the end of the
second quarter. Stepping in for
Van Pelt, he faked a pass and ran
the ball for 7 yards. The same
switch came again at the start of
the fourth quarter (running for 1
yard).

This was the first time since
1988 that Dickerson controlled
more ‘than one play at
quarterback. The irony here is
this: If Dickerson had not been
deemed ineligible for academic

reasons for the 1989 season, he
would probably still be calling a
majority of the snaps while Van
Pelt would be just another backup
quarterback.

“I was happy being back there
behind the center,” said
Dickerson. “I was having
flashbacks.”

In 1987 Dickerson started the
final four games of the season,
coming out with a 3-1 record. He
completed 35 of 93 passes for 375
yards and rushed for 78 yards on
45 Carries.

~¢dI!oi.o.u.o.« .-.1

In 1988 Dickerson opened the
season as the starting quarterback,
passing for 1,599 yards and
rushing for 555 yards, While the
Panthers went 8-5-1.

The switching of quarterbacks
against Temple did not appear to
adversely inﬂuence Van Pelt’s or
Dickerson’s game but offered the
Panthers a change of pace to
keep the defense off guard.

‘‘It helped take some pressure
off of me,” said Van Pelt.
Dickerson also said he did not
feel any added pressure on the

plays. “I just had to think about
what my assignment was and do
it,” Dickerson said. “The only
way there’s pressure is if you let
it get to you. I don’t let pressure
get to me at all. I just go out, have
fun and play my game.”

Van Pelt likes the break in the
position. “It’s a chance to get
another runner in and carry the
ball, and Darnell is just as good a
running back as he is a receiver
as he is a quarterback,” Van Pelt
said.

4-

Football season has had its moments

By Christopher Block
Staff Writer

Tired of people ripping on the Pitt
football team? Bored with all of the
“What’s wrong with the Panthers this
year? “ rhetoric? The truth is that
although the Panthers are going
through their worst season since 1984,
there have been some bright spots in
an otherwise dark football semester.

-Punter Brian Greenfield, as of
Saturday’s game with Temple, is the
top punter in the nation, averaging
476 yards per punt. The team is
second in the nation in net punting,
with 42.5 yards per carry, trailing
Brigham Young University by less
than 1 yard.

-Safety Doug Hetzler has a 13.4
yard punt-returnaverage, placing him
15th in the nation. This feat is
incredible, considering that this is
Hetzler’s first season returning punts
for Pitt.

-Quarterback Alex Van Pelt
became the second Pitt quarterback
to have two consecutive seasons with
2,000 yards passing, as he threw for
195 yards against Temple. The first

person to accomplish this feat was
Dan Marino. Van Pelt also reached
another Pitt milestone, as he passed
Rick Trocano on the all-time career
total-offense list Van Pelt is currently
in fourth place on this list trailing
Marino, Tony Dorsett and John

ANALYSIS

Congerni.

oTailback Curvin Richards moved
into second place on Pitt’s all-time
career rushing list, passing Craig
Heyward, who had 5,086 career yards
in three years at Pitt. He achieved this
goal on just his third carry of the
game Saturday against Temple.
Richards rushed for 89 yards against
the Owls, bringing hislcareer total to
3,158 yards and now trails only Tony
Dorsett for the top spot. He needs
3,568 yards to catch Dorsett.

-Junior Darnell Dickerson has
made a strong comeback this season.
Despite missing last season,
Dickerson has returned to achieve a

starting role at split end. In Saturday’s
game against Temple, Dickerson even
took a few snaps at the quarterback
position. Dickerson has 17 receptions
and is third on the team this season.

0 Flanker Olanda T ruitt caught ﬁve
passes for 89 yards, moving him up
four places to 11th on Pitt’s all—time
career receiving list. Truitt needs
only 50 yards to move into 10th
place. He also moved up to 14th on
the list for single-season receptions.
He also moved into fourth place on
the single-season receiving-yards list,
needing only 50 yards to move into

second place. Henry T uten leads the

list, with 975 yards achieved in 1989.

-Kicker Scott Kaplan has been
perfect on extra points in his Pitt
career, with 42 straight. Kaplan leads
Pitt in scoring, with 45 points this’
season. If he finishes the season on
top, it would be only the fifth time in
Pitt history that a place-kicker has led
Pitt in scoring.

-Tight end Dave Moore is second
this season in receiving, with 29
receptions and 377 yards. The 28
catches are the most by a tight end
since John Brown caught 43 in 1981.

Game

Continued from page 7

“The issue isn't the ﬁght; it’s how we responded

to it,” said offensive tackle Mike Livorio. “That
should have gotten us going.”

“Their [graduate assistant] just threw [offensive
tackle Scott Miller], and after that total chaos broke
loose,” said Deveaux.

“One of their [defensive backs] tried to take
Scotty’s knee out," Livorio added. L

But Pitt’s problems may run deeper than just a
botched special-teams play or a fracas.

“I'm very concerned at this point with what's
happened to our team. I thought it was Miami,”
Hackett said. “Now I'm not sure whether or not [it
was a] mistake when I said [Notre Dame] was our
bowl. Whether we sold out and did everything we
could for that and have not been able to recover,
I don’t know.

“Maybe there’s something about the Notre Dame

sellout,” Hackett said. “We’ve got to go back and
take a close look at that because we haven’t been
the same since.”

Pitt came out strong, taking the opening kickoff
and driving 66 yards on 10 plays for a touchdown.
Fullback Lance Markel ran 1 yard for the score. On
the third play of the drive Curvin Richards ran for
6 yards and passed Craig Heyward on Pitt’s all-time
rushing list. Richards ran 21 times for 89 yards on
the day, bringing his career rushing total to 3,160
yards, second only to Tony Dorsett’s 6,526 yards.

Van Pelt then hit'Truitt for a 12-yard gain giving
the sophomore quarterback 2,000 yards on the
season. In the fourth quarter, with the game out of
reach, Van Pelt connected with Deveaux for 16
yards and passed Rick Trocano into fourth place on
the Pitt all-time total yardage list. He finished the
day with 204 total yards, bringing his career total to
4,958.

Temple took the lead early in the second quarter
on a 1-yard, fourth-down run by Conrad Swanson.
The score was setup by a 51-yard pass from
Richardson to Richard Graf, who got behind safety
Louis Riddick. Riddick was also beaten early in the
third quarter by a 62-yard pass from Richardsonto
Rich Drayton to set up another 1-yard touchdown
run by Swanson

“I let the defense down," said Riddick. “That’s the

most atrocious game I can ever think of playing.“

that's all it was. I should be ready
for next Monday, though."

Dowling hopes to make All-

which means finishing among
the top 30 runners.
