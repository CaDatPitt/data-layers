A By Gwenn Barney. ~
‘ _ a Senior Staff Writer

Pitt’s 46-year run as a state—related institu-
tion might soon cometo an end.‘ ‘ A

Since 1966, Pitt’s status as_a state-relat-
ed university'has meant that in return for
appropriations from the_state, the Univer-
sity provides more reasonable tuition levels
than.Pennsylvania’s private universities. It
also allows the University to run programs,
such as public health outreach efforts, that
beneﬁt the Commonwealth. ~

But, with Gov. Tom Corbett’s proposed.

budget‘ threatening to signiﬁcantly de-
crease the state’s appropriations to Pitt for

the second year in a row, University ofﬁ“—‘

cials have said that the prospect of return-
ing to the status of aprivate university is -on
the table. ' » '

- “Basically, we’re being pushed in the
direction of being private universities,”
Chancellor Mark‘ Nordenberg said of the

, four Pennsylvania -state—related schools —
Pitt, Penn State, Temple and Lincoln Uni-
versity — when testifying before the Penn-
sylvania House Appropriations Committee
on Feb. 22. .

Charles McLaughlin, Pitt’s director of
Commonwealth Relations, said a change to
private status would mark a change in the
.University’s core mission. _ 6

According to McLaughlin, this change
in mission would likely include a rise in tu-
ition and an end to a differential between
in~state and out—of—state tuition. It would
also mean fewer community outreach
programs and the dismantling of smaller
University departments and Pitt’s regional
campuses. He did not specify which de-
partments might get cut. '

“The Chancellor loves the public.mis—

McLaughlin said. “To maintain the integri-

  Police clear bomb threat
the Cathedral of Leaming .  

By The Pitt News Staff

Students received notice of a general
bomb threat to the Cathedral of Learning
Wednesday morning, but after searching
the building, Pitt police did not ﬁnd any

B bombs.

Pitt sent out the ﬁrst Emergency Noti-
ﬁcation Service alert at 10:59 a.m., telling

people of the threat — which did not have '

a speciﬁc time or location —- and asking
them toevacuate the building.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said the
University did not see the threat as “cred—
ible” but was erring on the side of caution.

The building re-opened at 12:45 p.m.,

‘ and;_the University sent out another alert

that said the threat had concluded.
Paul Andrzejewski, owner of Peace Love
_ and Little Donuts in Oakland, said that the

, evacuation was far from hectic. He de-

scribed it from his donut stand that faces

_l the Cathedral on Bigelow Boulevard.

Andrzejewski said that students seemed

very calm when ﬁrst evacuating the build-

ing and remained onthe Cathedral balcony

until instructed by police to move across

the street; He said that it only took three

or four minutes for the building to empty.

But even though the added trafﬁc
brought him more business, Andrzejewski
said that he was upset when he heard about
the threat. V -

“I’m pissed off. I’m mad that someone
would do that,” he said. “The cops are al—
ready onledge. It’s offensive. It’s some kid
trying to get out of class.”

Junior Matt Condio, whose teacher had
not arrived for class by the time the alarm
went off, said he was unaware of what was
happening.

“You just saw dogs and people running
down the Cathedral stairs,” he said, noting
that there were K-9 units sniffing around
the building during the evacuation.

Despite the incident, Condio said that
he did not feel like Pitt’s campus has be-
come more dangerous, taking into account
the shooting at Western Psychiatric Insti-
tute last week.

“I still feel safe. After the shootings the

_ police are more aware and are try_ing to be

more cautious,” he said. Q

. - About an hour after police cleared the Ca-

thedral of Learning bomb threat, alarms
went off again.

A string of pulled ﬁre alarms spur-red
evacuations from four campus buildings

_ around 2 p.m. on ‘Wednesday. Students
and faculty from the Cathedral, the Hill-
man Library, Posvar Hall and Frick Fine
Arts gathered outside, awaiting the go-
ahead to return to their tables and class-
rooms. .

Pitt spokesman John Fedele did not
respond immediately for comment. A
city police officer from Zone‘4 said the
department did not have any information
about the incidents. -.

Students "stood around the buildings
and chatted amongst themselves about

' the events. Some professors continued to
conduct class outside, and students could

_be seen sitting around trees discussing
papers. »

Senior Jacqueline Geleta stood with a
few classmates, trying to ﬁgure out the
cause behind the alarm that brought them
out of their linguistics class and onto ‘the

S Cathedral lawn.

Activated yfiregailarms cause evacgllationsp,

“It could’ve been a practical joke done _

by a lot of people. Its a nice .ay day, but
that’s an extreme [joke],” she said.

Fellow classmate Sungmoon Woo said
thatif it was a prank, she didn’t think the
four-building ﬁre alarm activation was
very funny.

“I’m worried. .I don’t know what’s hap-. '

pening. I want to-know what is going on,”
she said.

A ﬁre truck parked outside the Hill-
man Library after alarm- activation and
departed around 2:15 p.m.

Around the same time, the incident at

' t-he Cathedral was cleared, and students

ﬁled back into the building. Some stu-
dents and ‘professors stayed outside_ to
continue class in the warm weather.
. Shortly after, the other affected build-
ings were cleared. -
Sophomore Chris Connolly said that
he evacuated the Hillman Library after a
woman told him to leave the building. He
added that no one in the library appeared_
panicked at’ the sound of the ﬁre alarm.
“It didn’t sound like a ﬁre alarm; .it
was just a bell,” Connolly said. f“Nob0dy

With Pitt’s regularly scheduled early-
round exit postponed until next year, Pitt
students have a chance to ﬁll out a dispas—
sion-ate March Madness bracket in hopes
of besting_friends, family and co—workers
in their betting pools. .

But many people don’t know that these
small betting pools are illegal and that or-
ganizing _or handling‘ the money for one
could result in a,two—and—a-half-year—min-
imum jail sentence.

That law prompted state Sen.“ Lis_a
Boscola, ‘D—Northampton, to introduce
legislation to make small,» friendly pools
legal in Pennsylvania.

She said that she was moved to act
when liquor—enforcement agents cited a

bar owner in her home district for hosting

a $1 Super Bowl pool. .
_ “It’s madness to have this illegal when
everybody is doing it,” Boscola said.

She said she held up her March Madness
picks on the ﬂoor of the General Assembly
Wednesday when she introduced the bill.

“This is a common—sense approach to

_ an everyday situation,” she said.

Boscola said her bill, which is co—spon—
soredlby three other senators, islmodeled
after a similar law in Vermont.

She said the bill would make these sports

‘pools legal as long as the entry amount is

$20 or less, there are no more than 100
participants, there is an established so-

cial, professional or familial relationship

I Legislation introduced to ,
legalize small betting pools ;

among contestants, and the proceeds go to 

participants of the pool or charities.

A press release from her ofﬁce said that , 

a similar bill _is pending in Michigan, and

Boscola, said that Montana also differenti-

ates between public and private betting.
Ryan Zeh, a Pitt sophomore, said that

he was only aware that small betting pools

_ are illegal because he was caught operating

one in the sixth grade by a teacher. He said
he only recalled being told that he wasn’t
allowed to do it and faced no further.reper-
cussions. . .

“We just made sure we did it so [the
teacher] wouldn’t ﬁnd out,” he said.

.,_,_;,‘Another Pitt sophomore, Ty Shedleski,
's‘5i'dfthat.he supports this legislation. ' e /I

' “I thought it was already legal,” he said.
Boscola ‘said that she participates in a
number of March Madness poolsvat work,

with friends and in social situations and
said the practice beneﬁts college basket

ball. - .
“If Villanova .— my alma mater — isn’t
in it, I watch because of my pool,” she
said. a ‘
But Boscola’s personal bracket might
upset some of her constituents. She con-

fessed that she has Duke University, a No.‘
. 2 seed, beating Lehigh University, a No. 15

seed from her district, inthe ﬁrst round.
“Ihad to,” she said, admitting she has
Duke going to the Elite Eight and eventu-

ally losing to Kentucky. “Not that I’m not 3

rooting for [Lehigh]. It would be the upset
of _the century. It would be great. This town
would go crazy.” I ~

Corbett signs Photo

By Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

Before Pennsylvania voters cast their bal-
lots in the November presidential election,
they will have to show an ID .

Gov. Tom Corbett signed House Bill 934,‘
also known as the Photo Voter ID bill, into
law Wednesday. It requires Pennsylvanians
to show valid government—issued photo ID
before they vote at the polls. In January,
the language of the bill was altered to allow
college IDs that haven’t expired to qualify
as well. i - ,

A press release from the Ofﬁce of the
Governor said that thelaw goes into effect
immediately, but the photo—ID require-

presidential primary election next month.
Corbett said in the release that he
signedthe bill to “protect the integrity of
our elections.” .
“I am signing this bill because it pro—
tects a sacred principle," one shared by ev-
ery citizen of this nation. That principle is:

one person, one vote,” he said.
/, House Bill 934 has not come without its
share of controversy.
Critics have said that its terms could
disenfranchise historically marginalized

voting groups that include the elderly and 

the poor. V V-
Rep. Dan Frankel, D—Pittsburgh, whose

constituency encompasses a large portion 1

of Pittsburgh, including Oakland, could
not be immediately reached for comment.-

Frankel has previously told The Pitt
News that he opposed‘ the bill because the

cost to implement it —— which includes 3 , 

paying for the new ID cards, informing the
electorate-of the changes and training poll
workers — would range from $10 million

 to $12 million.
ment will be waived for the Republican 7

He said that he views the bill as an “op—
pression technique” to disenfranchise mi-
norities.

But supporters uphold that the bill will  I

combat voter fraud. ‘

vote carries the weight it should in decid-

“We should be investing .

in our institutions of

—- Joseph Markosek

ty of the University and the strength of the
University, we have to consider not being
affiliated with the state.”

McLaughlin predicts that, at the cur-
rent rate of reduction, the.private status
might come in about two years.

“Hopefully that’s not where we’re go-
ing. Hopefully we’ll be able to maintain
state funding. Hopefully we’ll be able to
turn this around,” he said.‘

McLaughlin said that becoming a pri-
vate university would be a last resort be-
‘cause of the damage it would cause in costs
to the accessibility of higher education for

. ‘ Pennsylvanians. .

“That loss would outweigh any beneﬁt
to being a private-school,” he said.

Pennsylvania Sen. Jim Ferlo, D-High-
land Park, a member of both the state
Senate Appropriations and Education
committees, said he believes that Pitt’s
transformation into a private school
would be -a “terrible thing for our Com-
monwealth.” A

“If Pitt becomes private, there’s no guar-
antee how many Pennsylvanians won’t be

_ able to take advantage of a Pitt education.

More tuition could prove cost-prohibitive.

College loans already make up $1 trillion in ‘

debt nationally. God forbid Pitt go private
and add even more to that debt,” the sena-
tor said. V

Despite talk of Pitt becoming private,
McLaughlin said heremains assured the
moment of emancipation has not arrived
just yet.

“I don’t _believe we’ve reached that
threshold,” he said. “If the current 30
percent cut held and then predictions of
continued decline in Commonwealth ap-
propriations held true, I can see a time in
the future where we see the University’s
elimination from the state budget.” »_

State Sen. Jake Corman, R—Centre,
wasn’t available for immediate comment.
Corman, whosedistricta is home to Penn
State University’s main campus, previously

_ spoke out against Corbett’s proposed cuts

and said state—related universities should

be spared any further reductions to fund- ‘

ing.

to requests for comment.

_Corbett’s proposed 30 percent cut to
Pitt’s state funding would reduce the Uni-
versity’s appropriations from $136 million
to $95.2'million for the coming ﬁscal year.

.Ferlo said that there is a group of sena-
tors who also feelstrongly about this is-
sue. -

“These cuts are so deep eventhe Repub-
lican chairman [of the Senate Appropria-
tions committee] Jake Corman opposes
them. We have some allies here,” he said. ~

Among those allies ‘is the minor-
ity chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, Rep. Joseph Markosek, D—Al—
legheny. ‘

“I will be working with other legislators
to.restore at least some of the devastating
funding cuts Gov. Corbett wants to impose
on Pitt, Penn State and Temple Univer-
sity,” Markosek said in an email’. “Modern
workplaces require most workers to have
advanced skills. We should be investing
in our institutions of higher education to,

. ensure that students can succeed in the

workplace as the economy continues to

recover.”

A The state House and Senate must each
draft its-ownbudget proposal and agree
on a ﬁnal number before Corbett signs the
budget into law in June.

Last year, Corbett originally proposed a
50 percent reduction in state funding for
Pitt. By the time the state passed the bud-
get in June, the cut was recluced'to 19 per-

cent, leaving Pitt with $136 million in state ’

appropriations, one—ﬁfth of an allotment
less than it received in 2010.

After last year’s- appropriation cuts,‘

in-state tuition at Pitt rose 8.5 percent, or
$1,196, and out—of—state tuition rose 4 per-
cent, or $948. ' . ’

cal politics, said she believes Pitt becom-
ing a private university is a very real pos-
sibility.

“I think the chances have improved con-
siderably,” Hansen said. “We’ve faced such
draconian cuts three or four years in a row.
Now that the University is getting so little
funding from the state, I think that the de-
cision has to be, ‘Do we want to continue to
work under legislatiye guidelines?’” _

Despite acknowledging the logic in
Pitt’s -warnings of privatization, Hansen
mused on the sincerity of the University’s
threat to become private.

She said that it could be a legitimate ‘ ‘

decision or just a way to encourage legisla-
tors to restore funding. “It’s sort of a high-
stakes poker game,” she said.‘

As most Facebook users now

‘know, the nonproﬁt organiza-

tion Invisible Children recently
launched a campaign ‘ aimed
at (bringing Joseph Kony, the
leader of central Africa’s vicious
Lord’s Resistance Army, to jus-
tice. In -a. YouTube video that

lion hits,_ the charity’s founder,
Jason Russell, asks viewers to
publicize Kony?s crimes through

a variety of channels — a strat— -

egy he hopes will build pressure
- for the leader’s arrest. T‘ I

Well-intentioned as. the
movement appears, many pun-
dits have criticized Russell for,
among other things, distorting
the threat Kony poses to Ugan-
dans and deluding young people
into believing they can quickly
and effortlessly resolve a com-
‘ plex crisis. In a New York Times
roundtable last week, Ugandan
entrepreneur TMS Ruge com-
plained that Russell had mini-
mized “the voice and agency 'of
the actors we are trying to help.”
Times columnist Roger Cohen

' was more sympathetic, arguing I

‘that Russell at least deserves

credit for spreading awareness, ‘

althoughhis video is sometimes
misleading.

To a certain extent, we agree
with Cohen: Alerting the world
to Kony’s crimes is inarguably
commendable; although Invis-
ible Children obscures the nu-

ances of the conﬂict,_we’re glad,
that the international commu-

nity is  it seriously.

Contrary ‘to

a what YouTube

suggest, kittens
are not the nic-
est creatures in
the world. Rabid
kittens, in fact, are
easily capable

of turning civil
society into "

pit of, dis-
ease and de-
bauchery.
Although

there’s no evi-
dence that the Meyran kittens
are in fact rabid, their behavior
is nonetheless troubling. We
cannot risk our health and live-
lihood by remaining in proxim-
ity to these animals — we must
follow the advice of former
Vice President Dick Cheney: “If
there’s a 1 percent chance that
[kittens] are helping [disease]
develop [in our neighborhoods],
we have to treat it as a certainty
in terms of our response. It’s not

about our analysis  It’s about
our response.”

- With this in mind, there ap-
pears to be only one viable solu-

The latest pair of- kittens --

the lawn and people-watch,” Ad-
ams said.

But their friendliness is an il- '

lusion — they remain kind only
as long as people provide them
with food. Nearby resident

.Yes, my fellow Americans,

Meyran kittens receive only the
ﬁnest food to -keep -them from
revolting. While I would ordinar-
ily never make this comparison,
the situation seems reminiscent
of Germany in the 19305.

What’s even more abomi-
nable is that these kittens have

. taken the place of _ older, nicer

kittens. As ‘Adams notes, “Last
year, further down toward Bates,

-there used to be three black kit-

tens that would hang out on a
Meyran porch.”

But just like the dreams,
safety and comfort of Meyran

tens have disappeared. Indeed,
the new kittens have taken the

By Elizabeth Weisel
' Columnist

Afew weeks ago, I had the op-
portunity to get together with a
group of people from my church.
Some of them I knew well, many
were justacquaintances and most
I had never met before. But after
spending an incredible-time with

them at my friend’s apartment, I ,

felt like they were all my brothers
and sisters. .
When we convened for the

second time and the group had _
doubled in size, I knew_I had dis-'.
covered something special in this '

seemingly randomassortment of
people. I had found support, en—_
couragement, honesty, joy, trust
and genuine love. In short, I had
found community._

As I progress through college,
it’s become increasingly apparent
to me that a strong community is
essential for survival. '

We were_not made to be alone.
If we were, I would never be able
to live in a house with high shelves
and you would never be able to

undergo major surgery. We would‘ I

‘go crazy telling stories to our cats

or inanimate objects. We would
descend into a life without mean-

, ing, without any means of gaug-

ing right versus wrong.

By nature, we rely on other
people. We need them to retrieve
stuff from the top slielf, to pick us
up from‘ the hospital, to listen to
our stories when we’ve had one of
those weird days_.just as trees de-
pend on the rain to grow, humans
depend on each other to nourish,
support and improve their lives.

Of course, the deﬁnition of
community is hazy at best, and
the concept means something
different to everybody. For_ me,
community is -merely a group -of
people who share values or inter-
ests —- those friends who truly
believe the same things you do
on a foundational level. For many
people, those beliefs are ground-

_ ed in religion, but they don’t have .

to be. The stresses of a pre—med
course load or the stories Eng-
lish majors write naturally cre-
atea need for companionship. If

you’re a member of a club — es—‘

pecially one that’s service-orient-
ed — community. can arise out of
a shared interest in a particular

' career or subject.

a

I We were not made to be alone. elf
C we were, I would never be able" to
live in a house with high shelves
and you would never be able to

  undergo major surgery.

_But although this deﬁnition
suffices on a technical level, my
experiences have taught me that
communities also need to hold

one another to certain standards.‘ .

‘Accordingly,’ we can’t look for
community in any group of peo-
ple we ﬁnd on the street ——. it’s a
relational process that requires
‘us to evaluate friendships by the
way they’re inﬂuencing us.
This can be difficult some-
times. It’s not like you can’t have
friends outside of the community

— you’re building — donft abandon

people because they don’t ﬁt in.
But when you start associating

with a particular group, be aware
of who you’re depending on. If
your community doesn’t share‘
your views on life, it can’t hold
you accountable for not adhering
to them. When you falter —— and
you -inevitably will — you’ll. need

somebody to prop you up. Some- ,

times this requires tough love
-5 we all need someone to- call
us out. Sometimes this requires

- kindness —— just someone to be

genuinely nice to‘ us for once.
Communities can interact

in a variety of ways. Maybe the

members send one another text

_messages every morning to see

how they’re doing. Maybe they
convene at a restaurant every
week for coffee, or maybe they
get together every few weeks to
just be in the same room with one
another, to share their struggles
and successes. ‘

My community encouraged
me when I was trying to decide
whether I wanted to go on a mis-
sion trip over the summer. And
when I knew I wanted to stay in
Pittsburgh but didn’t have a place
to live, they helped me ﬁnd ac-
commodations. Whenever I feel
overwhelmed or lost or just plain
broken down, their encourage-
ment builds me back up again.

If you’re involved with a group
of people similar to yourself, you’ll
immediately notice a_change in
your life. You’re not meant to go
through this world alone -— you’
would be crushed‘ bynthe weight
of your own burdens. With com-
munity, you won’t have to depend
onyourself so much and stress
will be lifted from your shoulders.
Find community and you’ll feel
immediately relieved. I r

agree are- anti-cat. Any dissent ‘
betrays a level of intolerance -—.

as Secretary of the Interior Ken

Salazar notes, “Those involved-

in the debate have their position

based on fear and [kitten] rac-

ism.” I
With this in mind, there ap-

pears to be only one viable solu- ‘

tion: Spread awareness of anti-
cat discrimination and ensure

_ that everybody is open to as many

kittensas possible.

The newest pair of kittens —
a “ﬂuffy black . kitten and gray
adult_ counterpart,” in the words

' of ecstatic Meyran resident Sarah

Adams -— arrived last year. ‘_‘They
are friendly as you walk by and
like to_hang out on the lawn and
people-watch,” Adams said.

' But their friendliness conceals
the pain of alienation. Nearby

resident Holly Showalter com-
plained that somebody must
“leave good food out for them”
— otherwise, they’ll go hungry
and starve. _

‘ 1 As a persecuted group from an-
other territory, these kittens must
resort to handouts to gain enough
nutrition to survive —— there’s no
otheraltemative forthese huddled
masses in our supposed country of
freedom. While I_would ordinarily
never make this ‘comparison, the
situation seems reminiscent of

_Germ_any in the 1930s. ,
It’s not as if these kittens are

doing anything wrong. As Adams

notes, “Last year, further down

towards Bates, there used to be

three black kittens that would
hang out on a Meyran porch.”

The new kittens simply took
the position of the old kittens that
were ready to move on to bigger
and better things. Meyran Avenue
has seen, and will always see, new
waves of kittens,‘ each contribut-
ing to our diverse culture.

Don’t' accuse me of being *

alarmist —— that’s extremely. of-
fensive. I just know this campus
has a history of being mean to
new kittens. That’s just the truth.
I know.my history — I can recog-
nize that this always boils down"
to pure hatred and nothing else. -

Hopefully, the Pitt commu-
nity does something to purge our
minds" of bigotry. If not for me,
-then for-the children. I

WHAT TO DO THIS WEEKEND -

Toss your shots into cupcakes

|-—.

By Anna Weldon
Staff Writer

Whether you’re decked out in green or
wearing a festive sombrero, there is a drink
to go with every costume and occasion —
and now, there are cupcakes to accompany
them. .

It’s been a recent trend for bakers to ex-
periment with new and interesting ways to
make cupcakes. And they’ve started mak-
ing cupcakes that wouldn’t be appropriate
at an 8—year—old’s birthday party. By infus-
ing different alcoholic beverages into the
cake batter and icing, cupcakes have be-
come part of the adult-only sphere.

Virtually any type of alcohol can go into
a cupcake, but some combine for a deli-
ciously dizzying eifect. The bubbly nature _
of champagne creates a light -and pleasant
taste, while tequila forms a sweet version
of the ever—popular margarita cupcake.

For St. Patrick’s Day, Guinness, Irish
whiskey and Baileys unite to make the Em-
erald Isle ‘cupcake — a sweet twist on the

V —  sing bowl. In a
separate bowl, beat the egg and sour
cream. Once smooth, add the Guin-
ness mixture. Begin to include the
ﬂour mixture until all ingredients are
combined. Pour into cupcake liners
and bake for 17 minutes.

While the _cupcakes bake, start
making the ﬁlling and icing. Heat the
cream until it simmers. Pour it over_

liquor—and—beer combination, which also
makes a popular drink. The ingredients are
perfect for the Irish festivities.

Instead of mixing large amounts of al-
coholfor St. Patrick’s Day, the Emerald Isle
cupcakes are a tamer way to begin the eve-
ning. It might mean a few extra calories —
but those are calories of sheer delicious-
ness. With traditional Irish alcohol infused
into chocolate and sugar, the cupcakes are

i_rich. Like the drink, they are not for the

faint at-heart.
In May, the margarita cupcake offers a

light taste, unlike the heavier Emerald Isle

cupcakes. They are zesty-and have a hint of
tequila. _‘ . _

The champagne-cupcakes have a bubbly
ﬂavor pleasing to the tongue. These cup-
cakes are good for twenty-ﬁrst birthdays
because of their interesting ﬂavor and nice
appearance.

The delicious mix between traditional
cupcake ingredients and alcohol can add a
new dimension to the holidays early in the
year and become the one baked good that
Grandma will not make in her kitchen. '

By Larissa Gula
. Staﬁ Writer

A movie that uses all archetypes
and clichés ends up a has-been of
sorts. The audience has seen oth-
er versions of it a hundred times.
Unfortunately for Disney, the'
studio’s recent ﬁlm “john Carter” ’
— based onthe book ‘fA Princess
of Mars” by Edgar Rice Burroughs
— suffers from this issue. While

it entertains an audience well '

enough with its grand special ef-
fects, a viewer looking for more
than a typical blockbuster with no
substance would be _very disap-
pointed by the clichés in the ﬁlm.

“John Carter” certainly ﬁts ,

into a speciﬁc genre: sci-ﬁ action.

The problem comes not from the A

genre of ﬁlm, but from the pre-
dictability of the genre and the
ﬁlm’s refusal to divert from its
pulp ﬁction origins. .

It begins with a battle scene on

_ Mars, where a nameless villain is

given the power to take over the

dying planet and conquer the V

other cultures living there.

Cut back to 1881 in New York,
where main character and for-
mer Civil War captainjohn Carter
(Taylor Kitsch) is followed by
a strange man. Moments later,
Carter is found dead. A family
member Carter sent for before
his death receives his journal,

_ and the real story begins as the
boy begins to read.

The rest of the ﬁlm is told in
a ﬂashback.’ Devastated after
the death of his family, Carter
searches for a “cave of gold” and
avoids, civilization. During" his

search, Native Americans and a

cavalry start hunting him. When a
he escapes to a desert cave, he’s

‘ transported to the planet.Mars,

known as Barsoom by the locals.
There, Carter ﬁnds‘ the eggs
of a strange-looking alien race
known as the Tharks. Unable to
communicate with the Tharks,
Carter is taken hostage. Unbe-
knownst to him,»humans — or at.
least aliens who look like humans
— are waging war on the planet
and the Tharks. K .
Carter quickly‘ learns about
the situation when Dejah Thoris,
Princess of Helium (Lynn Collins),
arrives to the Thark community
.while ﬂeeing from an arranged
marriage that could end the ﬁght-
ing. It’-s here viewers discover that

i the villain from the opening, Sab
-Than, Prince of Zodanga (Domi-

nic West) was also Dejah Thoris’
betrothed. Despite his attempts
to lie low and just return home, 9
Carter soon ﬁnds himself swept
up into the conﬂict.

This movie —— despite its po-
tential and impressive special ef-
fects -— never pushes its bound-
aries. Perhaps in an attempt to
stay close to the source material,
the ﬁlm follows a predictable for-
mula, and the _characters ﬁt into

  john Carter"all thebin none of th

e substance

 

Courtesy Walt Disney Pictures

Despite brilliant special effects.. “john Carter" is wanting for a more inventive narrative.

.1

the narrowest of ﬁlm archetypes.

7' There is a villain with no back-
story or motivation who wants
to take over the planet. The main
character, who is ex-military,
feels homeless and wants to be
left alone. The princess,. a warrior
in her own right, wants to marry
for love only. ‘

Arid while the actors and ,ac- V

tresses certainly try to breathe
life and personality into these
characters — though the act-
ing in this movie may be more
hammy than good — little time
goes into developing the stories
behind the faces. In many cases,
potentially important characters
are not explained’ at all.’ Even

the conﬂictis very dry, and its
origins are barely explained. The
war, which is the driving force
behind the plot, merely provides
the backdrop for the ﬁlm rather‘
than being the focus. _

Even ignoring the clichés and

overused plot, the ﬁlm suffers

from sporadic pacing and tone
issues. Some important scenes
ﬂy by, while others slow the ﬁlm
down in inappropriate moments.
Similarly, some scenes try to insert
too much humor into a serious ex-

. change between characters.

* The 3-D is mediocre,‘ be-

coming more apparent in some »

scenes while almost nonexistent
in others.

Sadly, the interesting parts of
the ﬁlm are ‘completely ignored.
Cultural differences between
Carter and the Tharks, as well as
the complex undertones of~both
political and social issues,‘ are
disregarded in ‘favor of a quick
and simple plot comprised of a
-contrived romance and gratu-
itous ﬁghting. -

_The ﬁlm struggles to make its
pieces gel together, and its most
interesting elements are out-
shined by pure action. And while
the action scenes in this ﬁlm are
enjoyable and certainly enter-
taining by themselves, the movie
taken as a whole is silly, unvaried
and unmemorable. 

 

lloAge.concert loud enough to make writer forget South by Southwest. festival    

Byjeff Ihaza
Staﬁ’ Writer

As a native Texan, this is a difﬁ—
cult time of year for me ——- but No’
Age made it better. —

Every March, my Facebook .

gets ﬂooded with pictures of
my, friends at Aus_tin’s South by
Southwest festival seeing my fa-
vorite barids. Normally, I’d shut
down my Facebook and mope,
but WPTS’ recent No Age concert,
featuring locals The Lopez and

Triggers, reminded me that cool
shows exist in Pittsburgh, too.
LA indie rockers No Age made
the ballroom of the William Pitt
Union feel like a SXSW show with

-the addition of full—on crowd

interaction and an ‘unabashed
mosh pit.

The scenery of the William Pitt
Union made for a perfect venue.
Even No Age guitarist Randy Ran-
dall commented on. the unique
architecture.

“It’s great. Everything ﬂows -
kind of like’ linens in the wind,”

- Randalljoked.

The band certainly used this

to its advantage, incorporating-

the acoustics of the ballroom for
its iconic lo-ﬁ sound and using
the abundance of space to get
up—close-and-personal with the
audience.

The concert’s two openers, lo-
cal acts The Lopez and Triggers,
provided a taste of the ballroom’s

potential to become a bona ﬁde A

rock—concert venue.
The booming guitar riffs from
Jesse Lopez of The Lopez rever-

berated throughout the build-

ing, while vocalist Stephenwolf '

provided power-fueled‘ vocals
reminiscent of (Yeah Yeah Yeahs’
Karen 0. ' I

The Pittsburgh-native L mem-
bers of Triggers followed with
similar tenacity. Guitarist Adam
Rousseau cites a plethora of
bands as his. group’s influences.
The inspirational variety was evi-
denced clearly by the ba_nd’s _live
set, which varied between mo-
ments of Fugazi-style intensity
and more mellow vibes.

The local bands were perfect

«appetizers for the main course:

No Age. . «

The LA rockers came out with
full force, playing unfamiliar
songs that were packed with so
much intensity that the crowd

'still got into them.

As the show progressed, there

--seemed to be an expectation for

a few trademark songs, one of
which was “Eraser” from «the
band’s ﬁrst major album, Nouns.

_Summer’s nostalgic qualit part of
formula for best-loved a bums.  

By Nathaniel Hanson
WPTS Contributor

Summer brings out the best in people: sun-
glasses, good vibes and high ﬁves. And one
of the best parts of the summer season. is
the much-anticipated lineup of buzz artists
set to put out high—proﬁle releases.

. But what really makes a record an an-
themic summer release? There is no doubt
that there are singles and even entire al-
bums that hold that placewithin the criti-
cal sphere. But unlike a ﬁlm characterized

. as a summer blockbuster, a single or album

is held to different critical and commercial
standards. ‘ A ’

Take, for instance, the ﬁlm “Indepen-
dence Day.” Released on]uly4 many moons
ago, it might be the seminal summer block-
buster ﬁlm. Big, special-effect—ridden and
Bill - Pullman-infested, “Independence

Day,” while a great movie to watch on a lazy
August afternoon, is not particularly high-
brow or innovative. .

' On the other hand, we have the summer
music blockbuster. While the music block-
buster is without a doubt anticipated —
and ﬁlled to the brim with fun—appeal —
summer blockbusters in the music world
require much more intellectual or artistic
innovation than the run-of~the—mill Mi-
chael Bay movie. At least, that’s what most
critics will try to tell you. I think that, in
this case, most ‘critics are wrong.

Take last summer’s indie—rock cross-
overVThe Suburbs, by Arcade Fire. I’ll be
honest, I really don’t like anything about
Arcade Fire, particularly their music, but

. the fact remains that The Suburbs had ev-

erything required for a large-scale indie-
rock summer mega—hit: a nostalgic theme,

  WPTS "contender for mtvU
college radio award

p Byjefflhaza .
A Staﬂ" Writer

Pitt radio station WPTS—FM has topped the
charts by playing off—the—chart music.

The indie, student-run station is.one of 10 ' ’

college radio station ﬁnalists vying for the
College»Radio Woodieaward, presented by
mtvU.. Though Pitt had cracked the Top 25

in the past, this is the ﬁrst time Pitt could '

actually bring home the wooden trophy.

The award’s winner will be announced at '

8 tonight.

Last year, Pitt m.ade'.it'to:the:semiﬁnals-

before getting cut. But after a year of revamp-
ing the programming and upping student
involvement, the station could bring home
the bark. - _ . ' - _
3 “We’ve been nominated before,” said sta-
tion manager'Nate Hanson.‘ “But this year,
since we’ve been trying so many new things,
it deﬁnitely feels as if more is at stake.”
The station, available at 92.1 FM, has im-
plemented extensive innovations, thanks in
part to the staff of about 100 people who’ve

generated new ideas for programming. One
new_ addition is increased web content, such

‘ as podcasts, andinteractive content, added

in an effort to develop "a multi—platform ap-
proach. The station has also amped up its
campus presence, establishing connections

with The Pitt News and thepstudent Govern-

ment Board. _
“Probably our. greatest strength this year’

- is how we’ve fostered relationships on cam-

pus,” said Dan Scullin, WPTS programming
director. . p
The Woodie award honors pioneering

collegerradio stations -that broadcast the
. latest in indie andemerging music.- The _

 ‘stations were chose'n’based on reviews

’ and nominations gathered through Twitter

hashtags, Rate My Professor, and nods from
the CM] College Radio acknowledgements
and the Princeton Review. Fans could then
vote on mtvU’s website for the winner.

~“The Woodies are ultimately decided
by voters, and‘ our listeners deﬁnitely»ap—

were made to be sung with your bros in a
cheap car with the windows down.

OK, so-an album needs a certain bro-
ﬂair. But what are we doing talking about
Arcade Fire a year later when we’re looking
forward to this summer? '

The answer is simple:,because The Sub-
urbs is the blueprint for whatever record
it is that. you’ll be hyping and blasting this
summer — if you_’re one of those dudes
who wear cut—off skinny jeans, that is.

Even if you aren’t — and you probably
aren’t, but just bear with me —. the fact
is ._that chances are good that your favor-

ite summer album will, even in the heart

of February six long months later, still
make it to the top of your year-end list.
This is because you’ll have spent at least
two sunny months listening to it while you
hung out with friends, took a road trip and
made fun of people who drink iced—cappa—
frappa—mochaccinos and think that they’re
“really cultured.” '_ '

' Maybe it could be to our detriment that
albums that we like in the summer usually

take more special spots in dur hearts —
and year-end lists — than they ordinarily

would if they were released in mid—fall or ,
' the heart of -winter. After all, should ex— V

pectationsreally decrease just because of
what you were doing when you listened to
a record or how you were feeling when you
absorbed each track? In this case, yes.
Many critics .would argue that to dis-
count summer releases as sentimentally

backed would be to get a little bit too sub—v.

jective in our evaluation. But should crit-

ics hide behind this objectivity in the ﬁrst.

place? If they» do, it’s probably for good
reason _-— because they’re wrong.

Anyone who harps_on objectivity in
artistic criticism or evaluation probably

'.doesn’t have any taste to begin with —

they’re calledA'char1a_tans.
° What matters most is that summer
blockbusters are block-busters because

' they make us feel a certain way that com-

plements certain feelings and experiences

' that ‘can only happen on a warm summer

night.

Once the familiar plucks of the guitar began, a,

When the band played the single “Fever Dream-

“That mic might be a little broken,” he joked as
the band came out for their encore.

Before Wednesday night’s ﬁrst-
round CBI tournament game
against Pitt, Wofford head
coach Mike Young said he and
his players felt good about their
chances —- until he looked up
at the scoreboard.

“We felt we had a good plan,”
Young said. “We were all ﬁred

‘ _, up. Then right before the game,

I looked at the ‘scoreboard and
‘ saw that the Panthers had lost
19 times in [the Petersen Events
Center] in 11 years. Wasn’t sure
our chances were very good af-
ter seeing that statistic.”
Young’s hunch proved true
as the Pitt men’s basketball
team made a season—high 14
3-pointers en route to an 81-63
victory against Wofford. But
the Panthers didn’t get much

_. _, support from the Oakland Zoo:

Attendance at the game was
a meager 1,449 instead of th
typical12,ooo. ’

Freshman 1.]. Moore, who
scored a game-high 16 points
for the Panthers, said that he
hardly noticed the sea of empty
blue seats.

“I got the energy from my
team — on the bench and on
the court,” Moore said. “We
had our true fans there, so no

US.

Wofford kept the game close .

for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes. But
Travon Woodall’s 3-pointer at
the 15-minute mark of the ﬁrst
half ignited a seven—minute run

f V” during which Pitt (18-16, 5-13

Big East) scored 16 unanswered
points. Woodall ﬁnished with
16 points and nine assists.
The teams then traded
buckets until the half’s last
.— minute, when Moore knocked
down two 3—pointers —— the
second from a step inside half-
court — in the last 26 seconds
to give the Panthers a 42-21
halftime lead. »
“I was just feeling it today,

‘Wand it showed on the court,”

Moore said.

The Panthers shot 57 per-
cent from the ﬁeld and 58 per-
cent from the 3-point line in

Panthers prevail, dominate in CB1 opener  

the ﬁrst half.

Wofford performed sig-
niﬁcantly worse, shooting 9
for 31 — a dismal 29 percent

—- in the ﬁrst half. Drew Crow-
ell was the only player to make
multiple shots. The senior had
nine points at halftime and 16
for the game.

But Young’s rousing half-

time speech instilled new life
in his team, although he de-
clined to go into detail about
the speech. “I don’t think it’d
be appropriate for me to tell
you what I told my team at the
half,” he said.
Whatever it was, it worked.

Wofford mounted a run of I

its own as the Terriers raced
out to a 24-9 advantage in the
ﬁrst eight minutes of the sec-
ond half. Pitt’s lead shrunk to
six points.

“That was a game of runs,”
redshirt sophomore, Lamar
Patterson said. “They have

‘shooters that can get hot, and

they were able to hit.”
Yet once again, Moore
stepped up for the Panthers.
" The forward ‘connected
twice from long range on con-
secutive possessions to extend
Pitt’s lead to 12 points. .
-Wofford‘neve'r recovered.
Pitt head coachjamie Dixon
said that his players were ada-

-mant about continuing their
season in the CBI after failing .

to receive a bid to the NIT or
the NCAA Tournament.

“They responded well,” Dix-
on said of his team. -“You don’t

know what’s going to happen in '

a game like this. You wonder if
guys are going to look for their
own. You just don’t know. Ob-
viously, we haven’t been in this
situation, and after what we
did [tonight], I’m very proud of
our guys. It’s good to see some
young guys getting better.”
Young added that after see-
ing Pitt’s young players ﬁrst-
hand, he thinks the Panthers
will return to prominence next
year. 4
“Oh, I don’t think there’s‘
any question,” he said. “This is

‘ ablip on the screen for them.”

Pitt will face Princeton at

score in loss to Pennstate

By Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer .

On a night intended to honor the senior

members of the Pitt gymnastics team, a_
rookie Panther led the squad to its best

overall performance of the season in
Sunday ‘night’s home meet against Penn
State. ‘ ’ ‘

Freshman Haley Bodenheimer boasted V
P” a career-best a11—around score of 39.325

as she ﬁnished second only to Penn State’s
Sharaya Musser, nationally ranked No. 2 in
the all-around competition. Musser-barely
edged out Bodenheimer by .075 with her
score of 39.400; V _
Bodenheimer; has had an outstanding

 -ﬁrst—year  and has been
recognized for‘ her efforts. Last week,

Bodenheimer was ‘named Rookie of the
Week by the East Atlantic Gymnastics
League for the third time this season.

For Bodenheimer, the honor is one that
shows she is working toward her ultimate
goals. A

“As an incoming freshman, I wanted to
contribute to Pitt gymnastics and make the
team better,-” Bodenheimer said. “By being
named Rookie ‘of the Week, others must
feel that I am achieving this goal.”

Asa team, the Panthers also performed

at their best. Pitt posted a 195.075 score, .j.

which trumped its previous season-high of
194.750 from the team’s previous meet, a

S 7 Victory at George Washington. Despite the

record—setting numbers, the Panthers were
unable to best the No. 12 Nittany Lions,

who earned a team score of 196.425 in their .
win. Still, Pitt head coach Debbie Yohman"

was pleased with her team’s performance.

“The girls really competed today. They
just went after it,” Yohman said. “When
we made a mistake, we put it aside and we
moved on —— and we did that from event to
event. We wanted it to be our high score 
and we went out there and did it.”

As part __of the meet at the Fitzgerald
Field House, the-Panther team recognized
four senior members, Kelsey Ainsworth,

Alicia Taluclci, Lisa Taylor and Amy Varela,
and their contributions to Pitt gymnastics,"

including ' high scores in that night’s
contest against Penn State. Yohman was
not surprised with the efforts of her seniors
on their special night.

“We always do well on Senior Night, and
this was no exception,” Yohman said of her
veteran squad members. “The seniors and
this team don’t let anyone fall off. They

bring their best, and it is really showing at A

  Eastem Conference playoff A

scenebegins to develop  

By Nate Barnes
Staﬁ" Wri ter

r
a

As the'NBA season comes into the ﬁnal
stretch, it’s time to take a look at the
playoff race. For now, let’s give the Eastern
Conference its post—season rundown.

With only two clear contenders for the
Eastern Conference’s ﬁrst playoff seed,_the
races for the rest of the seeds will prove to
be the most interesting happenings in the
ﬁnal month of the season.

To no one’s surprise in the East, the
Chicago Bulls lead the conference and
the Central Division with. a league—best
record‘of 35-9. Led by their MVP candidate
Derrick Rose, the Bulls are a lock to enter
the postseason as the ﬁrst or second seed.

The Bulls are a very deep team and also
play great defense under the tutelage of
head coach Tom Thibodeau, the longtime
Celtics assistant and a wizard at defensive
strategy. Led by Joakim Noah and Carlos
Boozer in the paint, the Bulls also rebound
well and are set up for another deep playoff
run. _ ‘ ' _ « ' _

In second, the Miami Heat trail the
Bulls by two and a half games. This is by
no means insurmountable for a- team with
arguably the two best players in basketball,
a team whose improved defense, depth and
rebounding will also serve them well in a
deep playoff run.

Led by LeBron James, the likely MVP
winner, and Dwyane Wade, the Heat should
wrap up their division title soon and begin
preparing for the playoffs. At this point,
the Heat ‘are most people’s favorites to

come out of the East and vie for the NBA
Championship.

After these two stellar teams, the
conference takes a bit of a drop down to the
Orlando Magic, second in the Southeast
Division and third in the conference. The
Magic are four games behind the Heat, and
it remains to be seen what will happen at
Thursday’s trade deadline.

At 28-15, the Magic have the pieces to
either put together a deal for someone to

help Dwight Howard, or just mail in the

season and ship him off to New Jersey or
Los Angeles. But whatever happens, the
Magic have never fared well in the playoffs,

_with little talent to draw attention away
from Howard. V A ~

In fourth, the Philadelphia 76ers lead
the Atlantic Division and are two and a half

games behind the Magic. After a very hot
start to the season, the Sixers have cooled
off considerably and are 5-5 in their last 10
games. Expect them to continue playing
near—.500 basketball the rest of the way.

At ﬁfth place in the conference, the
Indiana’ Pacers are tied with the Sixers in
terms of the standings. But because the
Sixers lead their division, they receive the
higher seed. , -

Meanwhile, the Pacers are 24-16 and
will be a tough opponent for anyone in the
playoffs. They were four fourth quarters
away from upsetting the Bulls last year and
will be even better this year with another
year of experience under their belts.

The Atlanta Hawks currentlygown the
sixth seed but are just a game behindthe

. Talucci agreed with her coach and
noted that senior leadership has had an
impact on the team all season,’ inspiring
conﬁdence in the entire squad.

"‘Our senior class has rallied everyone
toward the same goals of competing and
winning an EAGL Championship,” Talucci

of 9.825. She then added to her Senior

Fellow senior Taylor was also able
to- set a new personal record as she
scored 9.800 in the balance beam, tying
teammate Bodenheimer for second

Panthers ﬁnished‘ the beam event with a
team total score of 48.825,._their highest

the team has done all year.

“Our goals and expectations for
championships are the same as theyuhave
been all season,” Talucci said. “If we do
our job and hit our routines, we will be in
the hunt.” I
