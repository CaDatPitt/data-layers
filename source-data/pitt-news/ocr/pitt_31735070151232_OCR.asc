Students
convene for
residence
life
conference

Staﬁ Wrz'ter

Over the weekend, a ﬂood of almost
2,800 non—Pitt students descended
upon Oakland. Moving in color-
coordinated droves, the students
attended a three-day conference

at the University called NACURH 0

2013.

Each year, the National Asso-
ciation of College and University
Residence Halls, or NACURH, holds
a conference in which school del-
egates from the organization’s eight
regions work toward bettering their
residence halls.

Pitt junior Wasi Mohamed, out-
going executive board president of
the Resident Student Association,
said the conference is an opportu-
nity for those involved in college
residence life to convene and dis-
cuss issues affecting campus hous-
ing at their respective universities.

“It’s like the world’s largest idea
swap for residence halls,” Mohamed
said.

Pitt was selected by the
NACURH’s National Board of Di-
rectors as the host of this year’s
conference after the University’s
representatives at last year’s event at
the University of Colorado at Boul-
der presented a 150-page proposal,
a video and a 30-minute presen-
tation. Immediately after, a dedi-
cated group of Pitt students started
to work with NACURH’s national

Western Psych shooting victim ﬁles suit against Pitt

Mahita Gaj anan
Stcyj’ Wrz'ter

A Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic security guard is seek-
ing damages from Pitt after suffer-
ing injuries during a shooting in
Oakland in March 2012.

Attorney William]. Gagliardino,
who represents Jeremy Byers, the
security guard, ﬁled a civil com-
plaint Thursday in an Allegheny
County court. Along with Pitt, the
complaint names UPMC, University
of Pittsburgh Physicians, rezsolve
Crisis Network, the shooter’s moth-
er and Shick’s estate.

Gagliardino was unavailable for
further comment.

Byers sustained injuries to his
left leg and knee when John Shick,
30, who suffered from schizophre-
nia, shot him and ﬁve others March
8, 2012 at Western Psych. Shick
injured four people and killed one
other before the Pitt police fatally
shot him.

The complaint details many of
the same events and names the
same defendants as an amended
complaint that Kathryn Leight, a
former Western Psych reception-
ist, and her husband ﬁled April 29.

Byers’ complaint argues that
Pitt is responsible for not ensuring
that UPMC maintained adequate
security measures in the lobby of
Western Psych.

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele de-
clined to comment.

Byers’ complaint details Shick’s
mental health history, which in-
cluded numerous interactions
with multiple doctors who are af-
ﬁliated with UPMC and University
of Pittsburgh Physicians, as well as
with personnel from rezsolve. The
suit claims that UPMC and its doc-
tors had ample evidence of Shick’s
violent tendencies to have him in-
voluntarily committed to a mental
institution, but failed to do so.

UPMC could not be reached for
comment.

According to court documents,
Byers is seeking more than $25,000
in damages. The suit also seeks

damages from Shick’s estate for
Byers’ injuries.

Attorney David Rosenberg, who
represents Shick’s estate, declined
to comment on the lawsuit.

The complaint also accuses Su-
san Shick, John Shick’s mother, of
“negligence,” saying she contrib-
uted to Byers’ injuries by not taking
steps to have her son involuntarily
committed.

Susan Shick could not be
reached for comment.

In a post on her sailing blog
last June, Susan, who was sailing
in the Bahamas at the time of the
shooting, denied that she ever saw
reason to believe that her son could
be violent. I

ministration to begin coordinating
this year’s conference.

“We did a lot to win that bid and,
since then, every single day has been
about getting us ready,” Mohamed
said. -

Ten students put together the bid
in 2012, but the group soon grew
to more than 32 members. While
most of these students were from
Pitt’s RSA, several other students
volunteered to help the staff.

According to an email from Pitt
Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor

Thursday, May 2

7:33 a.m. — A vehicle at 4141
Fifth Ave. was damaged from liq-
uid leaking from a pipe. Pitt police
notiﬁed Parking and Transporta-
tion.

ported the following violations to
Pitt police:

At 11:33 p.m. on April 14 three

Patricia Beeson, the Pitt adminis-
tration helped in preparing for the
event.

“But it really was the student
planning committee that brought
the NACURH conference to campus
and made certain that the University
was prepared for it,” Beeson said.

Kathleen Kyle, Pitt’s interim di-
rector of residence life, also gave
much of the credit to the students
and acknowledged that the Univer-
sity allowed staffers from Sodexo,
the housing department, the Office
of the University Registrar, Pitt po-

lice and more to work toward pre-
paring for the conference during
usual business hours.

“For the University of Pittsburgh
community, everybody had to be on
board to make this happen,” Kyle
said.

This year’s conference was the
ﬁrst held on the East Coast, and
Pitt beat out schools such as Kent
State University and the Univer-

sity of Southern California for

the opportunity to host NACURH
2013. Next year, the University of
Wisconsin—Eau Claire will host the

annual event.

Pitt senior Caitriona Leone, the
conference ﬁnance adviser, said that
the conference’s planning commit-
tee hoped that NACURH 2013 would
give attendees a chance to see their
world: the University of Pittsburgh
and the city aroundvit.

“I think we’ve done that with ﬂy-
ing colors,” Leone said‘ on the ﬁnal
night of the conference as students

funneled into the Petersen Events 1

Center for a banquet dinner, which
concluded a day ﬁlled with the ﬁnal
leadership and community-building
workshops and a career and gradu-

ate school presentation in the Wil— -.

liam Pitt Union.

NACURH’s conference brings
together delegates from all across
the country, as well as from Canada,

- South Africa, Qatar, the United Arab

Emirates and more. It serves as a fo-
rum for delegates to vote on upcom-
ing legislation, engage in leadership
workshops and share ideas on how
to strengthen a school’s sense of
community.

“One of the main things about
NACURH is really good network-
ing,” said Jenna Harris, a National
Residence Hall honorary member
and Residence Hall Student Asso-
ciation delegate from SUNY New
Paltz. “You get to see and hear really

good ideas to bring back with you -

to get people involved and staying
involved on campus.”

Additionally, about 300 students
worked with the service organiza-
tion Tree Pittsburgh to perform

community serviceand beautiﬁca- ..

tion projects in various neighbor-
hoods in the city, such as the Strip
District and EastlLiberty.

The conference presented more
than 300 different programs in
which delegates could participate,
with topics ranging fromleadership,

community building, diversity and
staff development. -
Michelle Amo, national commu-
nications director for the Residence
Hall Association at Bridgewater
State University, said she loves the
NACURH conferences because, in
addition to meeting new people, she
can “learn things that other schools

‘have done successfully to bring back

to [her] campus to help make it a
bigger community.” ‘
Attendees also engaged in phi-

’ lanthropy over the weekend by

participating in a book drive that
brought in nearly 4,000_books that
will stay in the Pittsburgh commu-
nity. The books traveled from dif-
ferent states and countries with the

1 students, who arrived in Pittsburgh

by car, bus and plane. Students then
worked at stations to sanitize the
books before redistribution and cre-
ated coloring books for children’s
hospitals in the city as well.
Friday, Saturday and Sunday
nights, delegates made their way to
the Petersen Events Center for open-
ing ceremonies, roll call and closing
ceremonies. Despite construction
on DeSoto Street that required
slight detours, the studentsﬁlled
the Pete each night with as much
noise and spirit as the Oakland Zoo.
“We tried our hardest to be

_ prepared for this conference, and

the way we did it was being very

detail-oriented — dotting every ‘i’ ,

and crossing every ‘t,’” Kollie Bilger,
a recent Pitt graduate and liaison to
NACURH’s National Board of Di-
rectors, said. “We think this is the
best university in the world, and
we wanted to bring them here to
proveit.” I

Libertarianism’s economic stance
undermines its other ideological goals

Nick Voutsinos
F or The Pitt News

Along with dubstep and skinny
jeans, the trendy political ideol-
ogy of libertarianism has per-
meated the youth culture over
the past couple of years. What
it offers to most middle-class
high school and college students
is something that their parents
cou1dn’t ever give them: absolute
freedom from authority. I think
Ron Swanson from the television
show “Parks and Recreation”
sums up the appeal of libertari-
anism best: “The whole point...
is if you want to eat garbage, bal-
loon up to 600 pounds and die of
a heart attack at 43, you can. You
are free to do so. To me, that’s
beautiful.”

According to the libertarian
platform, individual freedom
of choice is the most signiﬁcant
human right. And, like the plot
of any Ayn Rand novel, the only
thing keeping you from achieving
self-determination is the govern-
ment. This is a bold claim coming
from an American political party,
especially since our government
is supposed to be run ‘fby the
people, for the people.”

Nonetheless, young libertar-
ians’ concerns are completely

justified. With all of the political
gridlock in Washington, it would
appear that theprivatization and
deregulation of society would
create a much more efficient
civilization. Then again, com-
munism also offered an idyllic
solution to society’s problems,
and we all know how that turned
out.

Yes, communism is the com-
plete opposite of libertarianism,
but both fail for the same reason:
People are just plain greedy. Just
like in the USSR, a libertarian
society would quickly turn into
an oligarchy. In the USSR, only
members of the Communist
Party controlled the means of
production. In a libertarian so-
ciety, only those who control the
means of production will control
the government. Power can’t be
distributed fairly when it goes
unchecked, neither politically
nor economically.

Accordingly, democracy can’t
thrive when there are no checks
on human greed. In fact, I would
argue that the reason our govern-
ment is losing its effectiveness is
because of the small number of
checks on corporate power. Cor-
porate influence has penetrated
the democratic process in the
form of “lobbying,” which is a

Rand Paul,a Republican with libertarian views, has promoted controversial legislation. MCT Campus

nicer word for bribery. Essen-
tially, if politicians work to cre-
ate legislation that grants cor-
porations more autonomy, they
are paid for their efforts with
campaign money, which corpo-
rations provide under the guise
of “charitable donations.” Thus,
the only way to successfully run a
campaign in the present climate
is through accepting corporate
funds in return for represent-
ing corporate interests, slowly
changing “we the people” to “we
the faceless corporate donors.”
Seeing the lack of respect the
corporate end of the private sec-
tor has for our democracy, how
will giving corporations more
freedom help fix it? What lib-
ertarians seem to forget is that
privatized institutions act ac-
cording to proﬁt and not accord-
ing to the will of the people.
And the will of the American
people is to have freedom of
choice. Yet, if corporate power
isn’t checked, they’ll be free
to monopolize industries, thus
limiting an individual’s choice
in consumer society. Therefore,
preaching individual sovereignty
and complete economic deregu-
lation is paradoxical. Corpora-

tions tend to treat people as means to sat-
isfy their own proﬁt—motivated ends. The
actions ofthe corporate world show that
people are needed only to produce the
products and to consume the products.
Individual sovereignty makes things dicey
for big business. After all, it only leads
to workers’ rights and pesky unions. It
also means that all the advertising money
spent to “persuade” consumers to buy
their product goes to waste.

So I still ﬁnd it fairly hard to believe
that economic deregulation will lead to
individual sovereignty. Perhaps former

the libertarian vice-presidential candi-
date and sixth wealthiest person on the
planet, David Koch, can provide us with
an example. This poor man has been de-
nied his right to economic freedom con-
sistently by the government, particularly
the Environmental Protection Agency,
which stonewalls him every time he tries
to build an oil pipeline through an eco—
system. The EPA is clearly an enemy of
free enterprise, at least according to lib-
ertarianism because complete economic
sovereignty means that it’s his right to be‘

free to use the earth’s resources for his

own beneﬁt.
Perhaps that’s why Koch funneled
more than $67 million to climate-denial

groups in order to help inform the masses“

Editnorlallhlicieu

Single copies of The Pitt News are free and available at newsstands around

that the beneﬁts of pollution outweigh
the harms: the beneﬁts being that he gets
richer without environmental regula-
tions, and the harms being environmental
degradation. Plainly, the sovereignty of
the environment and the people who en-
joy its virtues are compromised by this
kind of brazen corporate behavior.

The fact of the matter is that our de-
mocracy is not a tyrannical force that’s
trying to prevent you from becoming a
rich oil tycoon such as Koch. Govern-
ment regulations are enacted to protect
the average citizen’s rights, one of which
includes clean air. This being the case,
your voice matters in our democracy. In
a true democratic institution, the people
have the power to make change happen in

their government. Contrary to this, the
only thing able to change a corporation
is itself.

So who is the tyrant here? Libertar-
ians cry out that Washington is anti-free
market. But I think the case can be made
that freedom for a few is not freedom for
all. Consequently, unless corporations
become democratic institutions, the lib-
ertarian platform of governmental dereg-
ulation and complete economic freedom
for all can’t possibly guarantee that the
rights of the average citizen will be pro-
tected. Corporate rights don’t translate
to human rights. So, until it’s plausible
to believe that CEOs have my personal
best interests in mind, it is hard not to
support the regulation of corporations.

CONCERT REVIEW

PREVIEW

64th Annual Three Rivers Arts Festival remains true to its roots

John Lavanga
Staff Writer

Though the city of Pittsburgh has experienced
quite the transformation over the past 30 years,
one thing that has remained relatively similar
is the Three Rivers Arts Festival, a summer
highlight in the city that has been around for
decades. .

“People who were not gallery or theatergo-
ers had their ﬁrst glimpse of live actors and
dancers, saw photographers stretch the dimen-
sions of light and color, moved among pieces of
sculpture and watched artists turn chunks of
clay, glass, wood and metal into bits ofbeauty.”

Taken from a 1979 program, the mission of
community connection to culture and the arts is
still true for the event today. This year the 64th
Annual Dollar Bank Three Rivers Arts Festival,
hosted by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, will
showcase abroad range of artists and musicians
from Pittsburgh and from around the country.

The 10-day event, beginning this Friday
with a kickoff concert by the indie-rock band
Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros at Point
State Park in Downtown, is entirely free and
open to the public. Fromjune 7-16 more than
300 artisan vendors willﬁllthe Gateway Center
and line Perry Avenue for the Artist’s Market
while artists play every night at 7:30 p.m.

“We wanted to make Pittsburgh’s down-
town, and Point State Park speciﬁcally, the
canvas for the experience,” Veronica Corpuz,
director of festivals and special projects for
the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, said. . “The phi-
losophy of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is to

present free and diverse offerings to our audi-

Tjzis year’s Three Rivers Arts Festival features performances by national acts and artists. Luv Purohit | Senior Staff Photographer

ences so that visitors and residents have an op-
portunity to engage with multiple forms of art.”
Natalie Sweet, a recent Pitt graduate and
frequenter of the arts festival, said the excellent
summer weather at last year’s event made her
experience that much more poignant.
“Itwas a beautiful evening outside, and the
festival gave us a chance to walk around Point
. State Park and enjoy the rivers,” she said. “This
year — like in thepast — I’m excited to see

the music performances, especially Edward
Sharpe.” '
The other musical performances, ranging

in genre from Latin ﬁink to bluegrass, include --

The Airborne Toxic Event, the Blind Boys of
Alabama, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and
Ralph Stanley, to name a few. The festival, if
nothing else, caters to every kind of audience
— it’s cultural diversity at its most heuristic

and engaging. »~

Corpuz said the Three Rivers Arts Festival
is one of the largest multidisciplinary arts and
culture events in the country and one of the very
few remaining entirely free festivals of its kind.
The artist market, known to host an eclectic
range of visual art, will showcase international
and regional works, including temporary and
outdoor installations, she added.

The last play in August Wilson’s Pitts-

istically nuanced portrayal of the issue
of gentrification and improvement in the
Hill District. The story follows Harmond
Wilks, an Ivy League—educated lawyer on
a quest to fix the Hill and become Pitts-,

efforts, Wilks runs up against the complex
implications of forcing people out of their
homes and what progress can sometimes

ing contest before yelling himself, “Hit
it! Hit it! Hit it!” prior to the ﬁnal hook
of A$AP Rocky’s “F*ckin’ Problems.”
Amid Lamar’s usual motif — which
includes heavy narratives about police
brutality, drugs, spiritua.lity, peer pres-
sure, moral dilemmas and growing up
around ganglands that played a large
part in Winning him such critical acclaim
—— he chose to add one more theme to

the night’s performance: crowd involve-

ment.

After songs such as “Swimming Pools
(Drank),” Lamar encouraged the audi-
ence to “make some noise for [itself],”
and, as the song came to a close, he used
the crowd’s intensity to furnish a rever-
berating chant of the final, recurring
word in the song’s bridge: drank.

As his set ended, Lamar Voiced his
appreciation for his fans and noticed
a small child in the front row who ap-
peared to be no more than 5 or 6 years
old. He brought the child and his brother
on stage and thanked them for their sup-
port.

Lamar turned to the rest of the crowd,
who was ecstatically aroused by the rap-
per’s every verse, and thanked them.
He said that it’s fans like the small child
and his brother who ensure his return to

Pittsburgh for more performances in the

future. I

One of the feature displays, and perhaps
one of the more intriguing pieces, is Brook-
lyn—based architect and artist Hugh Hayden’s
“American Hero No. 4.” It is a 1965 Ford Mus-
tang painted completely white, with unusual
racing stripes — unusual in that they are long
wigs of synthetic hair braided in comrows.

The piece, originally installed in NewYork
City’s Socrates Sculpture Park, is meant to be
a reﬂection of American ethnic subcultures
within the framework of the country at large
— namely, the mainstream or the American
dream as represented by the iconic Ford Mus-
tang, Hayden said..

“I think Pittsburgh will be a great site be-
cause it’s really a subset of American culture,”
he said of the installation’s placement right
outside the Gateway Center. “Heinz Field is
visually adjacent to it, and the Steeler’s grounds
crew painted the grass white around the car,
really bringing the local community into the
project while still referencing the national
identity and experience.”

Howard Blichfeldt, a local photographer
who will have a display in booth 203 from

June 7-13, said the artist’s market is the per-
fect opportunity for him to market his nature
photography in the city he loves.

“As a participant since 1990, this annual
event allows me to reach out to both new and
established customers in ways not possible
with most public gatherings,” Blichfeldt said.
“The revenue from [the festival] is one of the

The revolving door of artistic entertain-
ment throughout the 10 days makes forvariety
at the artist’s market, he added. “Because the
artists and displays are periodically changing,
you’ll likely see a new selection each time you

That dynamic nature of art and culture is
what drives the Three Rivers Arts Festival,
Corpuz said. “We want to connect community
to art, taking it out of the museums and into the
central hub of downtown Pittsburgh.”

“Unlike a museum, there’s no seats and
no walls — no boundaries to imagination.”

  Pitt loses out
on recent
transfers

    

 

J.J. Moore leaves Pitt aft hree season .
Bobby Mizia | Assistant Visual Editor

 

Nate Barnes
/isszstant Sports Editor

In continuing with Pitt men’s basketball’s off
season trend, two more players are forgoing
time at Pitt, one of whom the program never
even saw in a Panther uniform.

As reported by SportsNet New York’s Adam
Zagoria,].]. Moore has transferred to current
American Athletic Conference and soon-to-be
Big Ten member Rutgers. Moore seemingly
conﬁrmed the report when he posted a photo
of himself in a Rutgers T—shirt to his Instagram
account.

In his three seasons at Pitt, Moore averaged
6.2 points per game over roughly 15 minutes
played per game off the bench. As a member
of head coach Jamie Dixon’s 10—man rotation
in 2012-2013, Moore played a career-high 18.7
minutes per game and averaged eight points in
those minutes. His season was highlighted by
a career-high 21-point performance against
DePaul in March.

Along with Moore, Pitt also lost out on
transfer DeAndre Kane, who was dismissed
from Marshall’s basketball program. Kane was
originally believed to be a lock to transfer to
Pitt, calling the program a “perfect ﬁt,” but re-
neged on his original decision and will play his
ﬁnal season of college basketball at Iowa State.

Kane played his high school basketball at
Schenley High School, winning three consecu-

played on the 2007 PIAA Class AAAA champi-
onship team and averaged 33 points per game
as a senior.

Last season, Kane averaged 15.1 points
and seven assists per game for Marshall and
would’ve provided much-needed perimeter
depth for Pitt, given its loss of graduated senior
Tray Woodall and transfer Trey Zeigler. |

Multiple Panther players draft-bound

BASEBALL

Nate Barnes
Assistant Sports Editor

As Pitt baseball emerges from arguably its
best season in program history, the Panthers’
talented roster is now sure to be raided by the
prowling scouts of Major League Baseball on
Thursday’s MLB Amateur Draft, which runs
through Saturday.

The MLB Draft features 40 rounds of se-
lection, and, with a lot of potential impact
talent on Pitt’s roster, the Panthers’ 2013
roster could shatter the record for players
drafted in one year. The record is currently
held by the 2011 squad, which saw six play-
ers drafted, including Kevan Smith, who is
regarded as one of the top catching prospects
in Chicago’s farm system.

Elvin Soto C

2013: .320 AVG, 6 HR, 43 RBIs, .930 OPS

Speaking of catchers, Elvin Soto is widely
accepted as the best all-around prospect to
emerge from Pitt this season. The sophomore
catcher played with Team USA’s U-18 team
in 2010 and is ranked No. 225 by Baseball
America among all draft prospects ——- the
highest ranking assigned to any Pitt player.

The ranking isjustiﬁed as a result of Soto’s
prowess and potential behind the plate as a
catcher. The ﬁrst team All—Big East selection
hit mainly out of the ﬁve-hole this season,
with his batting average ranked third on a
team that hit over .300.

Beyond his average, Soto had 25 extra-
base hits, 43 RBIs and six home runs, which
made him one of the highest—producing play-
ers on the team and contributed to his .930
on-base plus slugging percentage.

The value of Soto’s offensive statistics
are also heightened because of the position
he plays. When calculating baseball’s Wins

Tampa Bay Rays showing how to stay
competitive as small-market franchise

Vincent Smith
Staﬁ" Writer

The Tampa Bay Rays organization is known
for many things: a young pitching staff, its
shrewd and frugal front office and alarm-
ingly low attendance rates at Tropicana
Field.

But one of the most impressive trends
of the last three years has been the Rays’
ability to sign team-friendly, one—year deals
that are viewed as coups come season’s
end. In 2013, the notable standouts are
ﬁrst baseman James Loney and second

baseman Kellyjohnson.

Loney spent six years with the Los An-
geles Dodgers playing in the shadow of
homegrown talents such as Matt Kemp
and Andre Ethier, but he emerged from
the Dodgers’ farm system as one of Major
League Baseball’s most highly regarded
prospects at ﬁrst base. And Loneyjustiﬁed
the hype in his ﬁrst season, hitting .331
with 15 home runs and 67 runs batted in
while ﬁnishing sixth in votes for the 2007
Rookie of the Year.

In his next two seasons, Loney main-
tained an average over .280 and hit 13 home

‘runs with 90 RBIs in 2008 and 2009. But

since the turn of the decade, Loney’s pro-
duction progressively declined.

For the latter half of his time in Los
Angeles, he failed to hit with much power,
and his eye got progressively worse at the
plate, causing his walk totals to drop for
four straight seasons. And after Los Ange-
les traded him to the Red Sox last summer,
Loney played terribly, putting up numbers
well below league average for ﬁrst base-
men, as he hit just .230 in 30 games.

Column  10

plus power and contact, combined with his
reputation as an elite defensive catcher in the
Big East — he threw out 42 would-be base
stealers in the last two seasons — should
guarantee Soto a draft within the ﬁrst 10
rounds this weekend.
Casey Roche OF

2013: .339 AVG, 9 HR, 65 RBIS, .950 OPS

While Casey Roche led the Panthers in
just about every major offensive category
this season, his value in the outﬁeld is not as
high as Soto’s behind the plate because of the
wealth of talent in collegiate outﬁelds today.

Regardless, Roche’s appeal to major
league teams still exists, and Roche has some
potential as a ﬁve-toolplayer. The junior’s
power numbers at the plate were comple-
mented by the team’s best batting average,
and he showed speed with 10 stolen bases
and played solid defense in right ﬁeld.

Obviously, thelevel of difﬁculty increases
as Roche moves onto the next level, but as
the biggest bat in Pitt’s lineup, his draft stock
deﬁnitely rose this season. If Roche lands in
the right situation with the right organiza-
tion, he could be an impact bat in someone’s
major-league lineup someday down the road.
Stephen Vranka OF

.2013: .318 AVG, 7 HR, 47 RBIS, .938 OPS

Vranka entered the season on the fring-
es when it came to the Big East’s best draft
prospects, but with a monster season hit-
ting lead—off and playing center ﬁeld for Pitt,

Steven Shelinsky OF-1B
2013: .311 AVG, 12 HR, 54 RBIs, 1.043 OPS
With his Big East—leading home run out-
put, consider Shelinsky a player to be se-

lected this week. Alongside his incredible -,

1.043 OPS, the redshirtjunior outﬁelder-ﬁrst
baseman possesses the power potential to
make his way to the big leagues.

The problem is, Shelinsky is a gamble.
He walked 51 times this season — a school
record — but also set a school record with 66

strikeouts. In the second half of the season, 1'‘

his power numbers didn’t resemble those of
his ﬁrst half as opposing pitchers adjusted
to his wheelhouse.
Ethan Mildren RHP

2013: 10-3, 2.35 ERA, 114.2 IP, 76 K

Mildren was without a doubt the ace of
Pitt’s rotation in 2013, and that should land
him in some franchise’s farm system this
summer. Over his three years at Pitt, Mildren
established a reputation as not just a pitcher
who could bring the heat, with his fastball
topping 90 miles per hour, but also one who

exhibited incredible control with an incred- "\

ibly low walk rate.

During his Pitt career, Mildren posted
a strikeout—to-walk ratio of 4.1:1, with 197
strikeouts to just 48 walks in three seasons.
Through each season Mildren made huge
strides when it came to the batting average
of his opposition, dropping from .328 his
freshman season to .235 this year.

i§’t’5"C“°LiiAN

In the 2012 offseason, the Rays signed
Loney to a measly $2 million —- a move
the Rays’ front ofﬁce does quite regularly
because of its miniscule payroll. To most
people in baseball, Loney was expected to
play above—average defense and hit around
a .270 batting average. Anything else would
be a huge bonus.

As June begins, Loney ranks seventh in
the American League in batting average,
hitting an outstanding .326, and his 0n—base
percentage plus slugging percentage of .919
ranks fourth in the league: A statistic that is
very telling of a player’s overall production.

Even more impressive, Loney is man—.

handling left—handed pitching this year,
hitting for a .373 average against them af-
ter he struggled to hit above .240 against
southpaws last season. Such a high average
against lefties is a rare mark for any left-

‘ handed hitter, let alone one with the recent

track record of Loney.

For Kelly Johnson, 2013 has been a re-
naissance year akin to that of Loney’s. He
has already mashed 10 home runs in 2013,
driven in 35 runs and ranks second among
American League second basemen in OPS
at .870. He falls behind only New York Yan-
kees superstar Robinson Cano.

Johnson, who had a career year in Ari-
zona during the 2010 season when he hit
26 home runs and ﬁnished with an .865
OPS, failed to repeat those numbers and
was subsequently traded to the Blue Jays.
Johnson’s offensive woes continued into
Toronto as he hit .225, and it was because
of these struggles that he signed a one—year
contract in Tampa Bay instead of cashing
in on a multiyear deal.

Both Loney and Johnson haven’t been
the ﬁrst fortuitous offensive success stories
to come out of Tampa.

In 2011, Casey Kotchman, a prospect
once highly touted in the Los Angeles An-
gels’ farm system, signed a minor—league
deal with the Rays and ended up ﬁnishing
eighth in the American League in batting
average after hitting .306.

The next year, the Rays signedJeff Kep-

pinger, the utility inﬁelder who had trouble
producing offensively the year before, and
turned him into a left—handed pitcher spe-
cialist who led the American League in bat-
ting average against southpaws with a .376.

The drastic increase in offensive produc-
tion among these players is made even more
enigmatic considering Tropicana Field is
a pitcher-friendly stadium. According to
baseball guru BillJames, the Rays’ ballpark
is in the top ﬁve of the hardest places for
hitters to dowell.

To add to the conundrum, Loney came
from Fenway Park, a notable hitter-friendly
ﬁeld, and Johnson came from the Rogers
Center in Toronto, a ballpark with short,
symmetrical dimensions in the outﬁeld.
There was no reason to think that either
player’s numbers should have increased.

The numbers also indicate thatJohnson
even prefers hitting at home more so than
he does hitting at opposing team’s ﬁelds.

For the Rays, their ability to turn around
the careers of seemingly Washed—up players

is a testament to the culture that they’ve I

created in Tampa Bay. The team, with a pay-
roll that could barely pay Alex Rodriguez
for one season, has won 90 or more games
four out of the last ﬁve seasons.

General manager Andrew Friedman has
made the most of every dollar he has been
allotted, and because Tampa has such a
deep farm system ﬁlled with talent, suc-
cess has become commonplace in Central
Florida. ‘ -

But assuming that the Rays’ front of-
ﬁce sees something in these players that
other teams miss would be a rash assump-
tion. Moreover, after sporting the league’s
worst attendance rates last season, Tampa
Bay ostensibly doesn’t seem to be the most
enjoyable place to play for any would-be
free agent.

All that said, the way Loney andjohnson
are producing so far is certainly newswor-
thy, and if they continue at the same rate,
winning the AL East is an absolute possibil-
ity for the Rays.

Whatever formula is necessary to jetti-
son a player’s-career back into the limelight,
it seems that the Rays have that secret for
now. I -

BASEBALL

2013: 9-3. 3.70 ERA, 107 IP, 85 K

Pitt’s opponents never saw-things get any
easier at the plate this season, with Matt
Wotherspoon following Mildren in the week-
end rotation on Saturdays. Wotherspoon
led the team in strikeouts and paired with
Mildren to become the ﬁrst pair of start-
ers to top 100 innings pitched on any team
coached by Jordano.

Wotherspoon’s fastball is by far his best
pitch, and, at the collegiate level, he didn’t
need to rely heavily on a solid breaking pitch.
But at the next level, Wotherspoon needs to
diversify his repertoire so hitters can’t hone

in on-his heat as teams did this season -—
Wotherspoon allowed 103 hits in 107 innings.
Joe Harvey RHP

2013: 4-1, 3.27 ERA, 5 saves, 29 K

Harvey stepped into the closer’s’role af-
ter the departure of Tanner Wilt from the
program alongside J.R. Leonardi’s early
struggles, and he performed well in his 33
innings of relief work. His ﬁve saves led the
team, and he struck out 29 batters in those
33 innings.

Harvey is somewhat of a question mark
when it comes to whether a franchise will
select him, but don’t be surprised if he’s
picked in the later rounds. But as a redshirt
sophomore, Harvey’s draft stock could rise
after another season in college. I
