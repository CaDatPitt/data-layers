, in the First United Presby-
Church, at Fifth avenue and
eray street, delivered the bac-
ureate sermon to this "year's
graduating class of 422 students. He
chose as his text Hebrews 11:40:
“God having provided some better
thing concerning us. that apart from
us they should not be made perfect.”
Proﬂteerlng, commercialization of
patriotism and sabotage were depre-
cated by' Dr. McCormick. He em-
phasized in his address the spirit of
unrest pervading the world. These
conditions, he said, cannot continue
indeﬁnitely, but will correct them-
selves. Preceding the baccalaureate

symbolizing as it does not only the
addition of a great ediﬁce to the
University's group of buildings, but
also the greatest tangible evidence
of the continuing interest and loy-
alty of the thousands of former stu-
dents whose gifts made possible its
election.

The program for this afternoon is
a short and simple one, and is pre-
sented entirely by Pitt men. Ross
T. McCormick, '88, of Irwin, the
newly elected president of the Gen-
eral Alumni Association, will pre-
sid-e. Mr. McCormick has been for’
years a leader in alumni activities,
is among the most active and loyal
of Pitt's graduates and was himself
a mighty -factor in the raising of the
Alumni Hall Fund.

The Pitt Band will play just be-
fore the ceremonies and will lead: in
“Alma. Mater." The invocation will
be prononunced by the Rev. Dr.
Samuel J. Glass, ’75, pastor of the
McClure Avenue Presbyterian Church.
Dr. Glass is not only an active and
interested alumnus on his own ac-
count, but is the head of a typical
Pitt» family, having -sent his two
sons to the Universly. .

are race clubs, recreation clubs,

of a conceivable club, those costing a
fortune to enter, and two to get out;
those costing nothing to enter, and
paying about the same dividend. It
is in the clubs, though, that the old
gridiron and ball games are played
again, where Pitt and Cornell lineup.

.,Most men have the feeling that they

 are going somewhere, and they want

.to’ arrive. At least they want the
race to arrive. The thought that
'-§‘:_ge£‘nerations are to come and go and
‘that there is nothing more, no pur-

 fv pose in it all, no destination, no
_14 1 progress toward a ﬁnal

consumma-
tion, is paralyzing and intolerable.-

“It is not. so. One generation ﬁnds

‘ its realization, not in itself, but in the

generation which follows. The men

of --faith, Abraham,‘ David, Isaiah and

 the rest, described in the eleventh of
 Hebrews, with all their achievement;

never reached the city toward which
their anxious and longing eyes were

,  directed, whose Builder and Maker is

God, ‘never received the fulﬁllment of

 “the.;r»p-romise and could not, because
“  _ only in the future could realization

come. They went out, after living

‘I "i and suﬂering, after aspiring and striv-

ing, leaving for us the fuliillment"of it
all. They .were themselves incom-
plete, for only in us could they be
complete. If we fail, they also fail.
If we gather up the banner which
falls from their hands we carry on
their work and we fulﬁll the promise
made to them. If we look for the city
nearer to us than to them and climb
upward toward it, we are bringing it
to their vision, too. VVe carry with
us all who have gone before and thus
become the fulﬁllment of all they
dreamed and hoped, the realization of
all they strived to attain. No power
_ on earth can relieve us from the obli-
gation to preserve unbroken the line
of hope and effort extending from
those who have gone before. The
. reason men are in the world is found
in this signiﬁcant fact. The individual
is not an individual by himself.‘ His

absorption ‘ in‘ "self which tempts men”
‘to disloyalty to their fellows’ and to
God. in the measure in which the in.-
dividual dissociates hims from his
-fellows in the eager pursuit of selﬁsh
interest, in that measure is he dis-
loyal to himself and to his own re-
sponsible part in the chain of circum-
stance and disloyal, too, to those
faithful ones who-had to ..lay down
-their uncompleted task in hope that
those coming after them would carry
it to perfect fulﬁlment. ,
“This thought makes it a shameful
thing for us if weare content to sit
idly by and let wrongs become so bad
that they must cure themselves. to
prevent utter destruction. It is our
business to take hold and, not only
preserve the standard of excellence
of the preceding generation, but raise
that standard noticeably higher by the.
’contribution we ourselves make to it.
Life, therefore, becomes a,serious,
purposeful thing. One can not deal
with it carelessly. It is not ours; it

tudes who have lived and who are yet
to live. , . . .,
“The roll of our heroes in -America
is different from those enumerated in‘
this Eleventh Chapter of Hebrews. It
is the names-"only, however, which are
different. The souls were of the same
heroicmold asthose of our ancient
fathers. These men lived in a creative
period of human history. Perhaps it
was given to-the group of men who‘
produced the Constitution of the Re-
public to see farther and think more
deeply than was true in most other
epochs of history. Certainly this was
true in respect to the science of
Government. Perhaps in the develop-
ment of human affairs the time had
come when a new idea in Govern
ment was ‘essential to the "unfolding
f the Divine plan. Monarchies were
known, aristocracies
even democracies were known. Re-
publics were not yet born. The time
had come when, in the new world, in
a new atmosphere, with a new con-
ception of freedom, with a. new ideal
of manhood and a new appraisal of
personality, 3. new political. system
should be called into being. Our
revolutionary fathers conceived‘ it,
and it was brought forth on this Con-
tinent one hundred and thirty-three‘
years ago. It was theirs to create the
Republic; but it‘ remained for those
,-who came after: themto make it a
Splendid reality. The Constitution
was produced in the Constitutional
Assembly of 1787; but it was John
Marshall who made it a living, breath-
ing thing. It is we who are to carry
on toward completion the government"
of and for and by the people. The.
great mass of men of that time were‘
not experienced enough, were not in-
telligent enough, werenot broad and-
unselﬁsh enough, were not noble and
magnanimous enough to appreciate
the momentous thing which had. come
to pass. If we of this generation do
not measure up to what is required of
us, then the perfecting of the Repub-
lic will become the privilege and the
opportunity of a. generation which
will come after us_ I I
“So, too, with the new conception
of liberty, of personality, of manhood:
Perhaps it was the sparse population,
the unlimited expanse , of mountain
and valley and. prairie, the depend-
ence of neighbor upon neighbor, and
the personal initiative which neces-
sarily developed which were respon-
sible; but certain it is gie individu-
ality and personalitywer in America
vastly different’ conceptions from any
which prevailed in the old world. The
idea of equality before the law, of
personal liberty, of the rights‘? of the
individual, found expression, not only
in the Declaration of Independence and
in the Bill of Rights, but in the social
order which developed in the new
country as the foundations of the Re-
public were securely laid over a cen-
tury ago. _ . ' _
“If any particular generation -is to
carry forward what it receives from
the past it must «intelligently study
and unselﬁshly assume responsibility
for the solution of the problems which
arise in‘ every successive period of

when _many of these are acute and
menacing. One needs ‘to orient him-
self properly in this day if he forges

"the linklstrongly which is his in the

chain connecting. past with future.
The order which seemed established
is suliject to hostile attack from every
side. Civilization may ‘crumble and
fall if people are careless and indif-
ferent to it. Nothing is so ﬁrmly
founded as to stand if the foundations
are not buttressed against every pos-
sible assault. If in any epochﬁ these
assaults are . more numerous and
more violent, the obligation resting
upon the people of that generation to
understand, to defend and to make
more secure the institutions which are
good, is the greater and more impera-
tive. '

“Is the Republic worth saving?
Certainly the people who ordained it
have the right to change it and make
it something else, it‘ they wish. They
should" not permit its enemies, how-
ever, to do this, either because they
are not alert to -the danger or be-
cause they are indifferent to what
may be‘ brought about. The President
may usurp the power of Congress or
the Court. Bad as this would be, it
is no worse than would be the at-
tempt of the people to legislate di-
rectly, rather than“ through their
chosen representatives, as in the ini-
tiative and referendum or as in that
still more radical attempt on the part
of the syndicalist to destroy govern-
ment altogether by the creation of an-
lndustrial system which completely

_ “Is freedom, as we have it in
America, worth saving? Does per-
sonality, as we conceive it here,
count foranything? Is ambition to
rise and to achieve a worthy emotion?
Is there a. legitimate aspiration for
excellence and for advancement‘
among one's fellows? Is there a place
for individuality in a Republic _con-
sistent with social well-being?‘ If so,
then it is an obligation resting upon
the people of today to preserve it
against the determined attack» .of
those who do not believe in it at all.
Socialism, which avows its interest in
the people and its purpose tohave all
share equally in social, industrial and
political beneﬁts, is good and will pre-
vail unless the people, themselves
awaken to the menace to personality

inherent in any social scheme, the

most beneﬁcent or the most radical.

“And property? Vast fortunes have
been accumulated by individuals in
free America, and during the recent
war these have multiplied. Capital 
vested in gre industries has wielded‘
tremendous power."These are -reckon-l

,Pr_oposals are m_a.de'tfo devise laws to‘

-by ingenious schemes of taxation.
Others have proposed complete con-
ﬁscation of all property for the‘ pre-
sumed beneﬁt of the physical toiler,
who alone is reckoned worthy of con-
sideration. Is property a material
thing? Do hands createit? If the
right of private property should be
denied, what would be the effect,
good or bad? ‘Where ‘would this ‘effect
'be_ felt, in body or in soul? Would
it be ‘beneﬁcentv or otherwise? ‘Is
property an attribute of personality

fort and to achievement? Is the in-
stinct of ownership conducive to or-

ent men may answer these questions
differently, but they must be answer-~
ed. The contest is on._ Conﬁscation
is urged by a large group of peoples
If it is a good thing, let them have
their way; but if it‘ is_ a bad thing,
then we must know why it is a bad
thing and must beprepared to resist’
these men to the end. Above all" we
should be careful ‘to avoid, underany
pretext, thexconﬁscation of any legal‘
property, simply because we’ do not
like the use to which it is put. If,
property is gopd we must know why
it is good and, ifit is a. right ordained
by Almighty .'God and‘ ‘guaranteed,
under the Constitution, we’. must as-«
sert that right and defend it at any
possible cost. Q . S
“What place has religion in the
State and its organized institution,
the Church? Jesus answered this
question very deﬁnitely, when he de-
clared that ‘Men must render unto
Caesar the things that are ,Caesar’s,
and unto God the things that are
God’s.’ The sphere of the State is
one and the sphere of the Church is
another; but every man must dis-
charge his duty in both. If ‘there was
one principle in which the fathers of
the Republic believed with all their
hearts, and which they established in
the fundamental law of the Republic,
it is the principle _of the._complete-
separation of Church and State and
the absolute obligation to be true to
duty in both of these relations. It is
a principle which we who are to hand
down a better Republic than we re-
ceived must also defend and com-
pletely establish. There are those in
America who would make the Church
superior to the State and others who
would make the State superior to the
Church. There are still others who
would destroy both. The Ten Com-
mandments are today questioned and
denied exactly as the right of private
property is questioned and denied.

power: whlchgurges us to supreme‘ en-
deavor and which sustains us in the‘
period of‘ stress and discouragement,
of perplexity,» doubt and fear of
mountains of peril and of adversity.

The issue is not in doubt for a single
moment. Remember, that the Messiah
of Isaiah ﬁfty-third, looking down
through the centuries, seeing all the
grief and struggle, despised and re-
jected of men, a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief, stricken, smit-
ten of God, afflicted, wounded for
our transgressions, bruised for our
iniqu.ities,;_, remember, that .He was
sustained, that He "saw His seed;

that He was assured that the pleasure
of Jehovah would prosper in His
beholding all this

satisﬁe.d——satisﬁed, because in the.
vision was the people ﬁnally redeem-
ed and the glory of Jehovah ﬁnally
and forever established. His vision
may be“ ours, if we forget ' not the
past, if we depart not from the-moon
ings of God, and if we set ourselves
to the completion of the task handed
down to us by our fathers. M ‘ ‘

“Members of the Graduating Class:

“I counsel you to be true to the
obligation imposed upon. you by those
who wrought and builded in temporal
and in eternal things in the genera-
tions-gone. Upon you in ‘ this time
rests a greater measure _of responsi-

bility, as we see it‘, than in perhaps .
any other period of history. The at- __
tack upon established institutions, re-

ligious. and political, is more power-

ful and virulent than ever before. The M
"assailants will be beaten off and the E

victory of faith will be won only
when we forget self and throw our-
selves whole-heartedly into the‘ strug-
gle. We are simply completing what
others have begun. We are charged
with the duty of making perfect the
lives and the work of the men of God,
the worthies of the generations reach-
ing back to the beginning. It isours,
also, to remember that we are to
hand down to those who come after
us, not what we received from our
fathers, but something_ far better.
Only as we are true, as we have faith,
as’ we trust in God, as we toll un-
selﬁshly and unweariedly, will we in
our time do the part assigned to us,
and only so shall we, 'too,. like the
heroes of the past, fall
the satisfaction that we have done
our part, and with perfect assurance
that in God’s own time the work shall
be fully accomplished. m-ade perfect
and complete through those who come
after us. In my prayers for you, that

Acro Club was held at the Schenley '

evince an uncanny concern about the
subject matter of their gtudies, even

sirens and blithesome bevies of viva-
clous vamps were wont to ply their
trade, and where on any -balmy day
in May and June one might discern-
enamored couples gaily chattering, or
fondly cooing in enraptured oblivion
-—all these haunts bore a deserted ap-
pearance. As ‘one Pitt , student,
driven to distraction. by a volley of
examinations, ironically ‘commented.
“In June, the young man's fancy-
lightiy turns to thoughts of-examine: -
tions.” ' ,
That beaming. smiling countenance

belongs to the select few who were
granted exemption in at least some of
their subjects.‘ Conversely, that sour
and solemn visage you came across
likely belongs to him or her who had
to submit to all examinations._ No
general ruling was issued from the
office of the Registrar concerning the
qualiﬁcations for exemption, it being
deemed best to let each instructor
adopt a policy appropriate to this de-
partment or course. In some depart-
ments, where qula hours are held
weekly, and the student's knowledge
of the subject tested constantly, the
fatmlty was exceptionally generous in
its exemptions. relieving from exami-
nations virtually all who had made a
0 plus or better" for the semester.
Several instructors made “B" .the
dead line between “exam” and “no
exam.” In other departments, ex-
emptions -were few and far between,
and in still others, they were nill.

The members of ‘ the Senior Class
were in many cases given their ﬁnal
tests earlier,__ so that their total num-
ber of credits might be ascertained.
Judging from stray gossip and com-
ment on the campus, the examinations
were not as bad as they had been
painted, though there were also to
this rule many exceptions, where
Prof, “Blank” seemed to make it his 4
malicious sport in entangling the un-
wary Pittite in a medley oi'_ foot-note
queries and the most intricate ques-
tions he could concoct. In a few
classes. notably in some of the Ger-
man, French and Spanish classes. the
tests were conducted orally. When
interviewed, several members of the
faculty admitted that the final exami-
nations were, as far as their subject
was concerned, a mere formality,
since they had already made up their
minds what each student was worth.
Despite the liberality with which
exemptions were granted in some de-
partments, most of the Pitt faculty
found themselves swamped with a
vi ual avalanche of test-papers, and
many of them are still wearlly plug-
ging away at the tedious task of mark-
ing them all. A -few instructors.
when questioned about the general
records made on examinations, ex-
pressed themselves as highly grati-
ﬁed with the showing made. Some
admitted that they were completely
baffled by the amazing and hitherto
unsuspected knowledge of the subject.
displayed by some students. “They
must have been burning the midnight
oil of late,” was the suggestion made
by one member of the faculty; And
those who sat up all night cramming
for.t.he examinations. and the next
day drowsily dosed through'the lec-
tures. privately admitted that there
is some truth in this statement.

 ‘ﬁrms latter
occasion "offered an, opportunity to in-
struct the young ’uns about Uncle
Sam's postal system. The first grade
children have gone a step farther and
have laid out a little village, with
houses; a grocery store,‘ butcher shop,
confectioner’s, drug store and jewelry
store, all made of blocks. The stores
are all well stocked and trade is brisk.

In the second and third grades are
the ﬁrst signs of specialization. Here,
in the center of the coal district, on
the bank of a ﬂowing river, is a typi-
.cal mining town. Deep shafts lead
down from the surface of the table
tothe coal stratum, and there are
.chutes to convey the coal to both rail-
road and barge. An intricate draw-
bridge spans the river. This town
boasts of a church with real stained
glass windows- The children of this
class, have. during the last few
months," imbibed a great deal of scien-
tiﬁc (information and a group of young
hopefuls visited Thaw Hall the other
day for more detailed study of some
engineering principles,

The School of Childhood, from a
very small beginning has been devel-
opingsteadily. The faculty is hoping
to add a fourth grade next year to
install a miniature electric lighting
system’ for the children's use, to make
possible primitive telephony, with
lines that will conduct sound. The
work beingdone in this small build-
»ing is attracting the attention of edu-
cators all over the United States.

as the Freshies have a strong aggre-
gation and some are inclined to -be-'
lieve that they can put the woggle to
the Varsity. V

To close the year in baseball, the
Blueand Gold will journey to Penn
State. Pa., to meet Hugo Bezdek’s
nine in two games, one on Saturday,-
June 12, and the other on Monday,-
June 14. Pitt is going up there to
avenge a defeat suffered at the hands
of the up-Staters earlier in the sea-

Football is playing‘ such an important part in the development of
the University, and hasesuch a ‘strong hold on -the alumni, students
.and,.o’thers'that it is deemed wise, in this final Issue of the f‘Pitt

might becalledj the “official dope" on the prospects for this fall.
Every one interested in the team-hasa general idea along this line
but wears -sure they wiliwelcome an analysis, of the material avail-

and know just ,wh-at-‘-men they can count on for the team. _

to a. par with football. It is not be-
cause they have not talked track,
