silty.‘ I also learned much‘ about it
from ‘my, beloved, friend and ‘parish-
iioner, thealate Henry Lloyd, who was
one of the jTrus'teesV of the University,
and whotold me. that he was making
good ‘a subscription which he {had
inade -to the‘ institution by building
an additionifor the"u‘se of the Chem‘-
"ical lliaboratory on‘ the ‘ Ross Vs‘tre‘e‘t
side of the main building. ’I—Ie Jgave
thisbuilding his personal supervision,
and at the same time paid the bills of
the contractor as they fell due.
About a year after my -coniing to
Pittsburgh I was elected a member of
a‘ small society? ‘known as u..1‘l1e
Shakespeare Club." Lone of the mem-
bers of the “lorgznization ‘was Pro-
fessor Samuel P. Langley, “and at a‘
later date his Assistant, . Albert E.
Frost, who came to bethe Professor
of Physics in -s‘.1bsequen‘t‘ years, and
who was‘ long the ‘Registrar of the
University. We hold him in blessed
memory. He was lovingly known by
‘a whole . generation of ‘students as
“Mother Frost”. "He indeed “moth-
ered” the sturlents, and with meticu-
lous care looked after their interests;
I willnot detain you by my reminis-‘
-cencestof The .Shakespeare‘Club,. al-
mostall the members of which have
long since passed away,‘ but’ it was
certainly a feast for us to ‘succeed, as
we once -did, in inveigling Professor
Langley, a. conﬁrmed old bachelor, in-
to accepting the role-of Romeo vis-a-
vis with one of the ifaiir young belles
of the city, who assumed the part of
Juliet. Theirendition ofthat play was
the occasion of almost ‘riotousmirth.
My actual contacts.‘ with the Uni-
versity during the first twelve years
of my life in Pittsburghwere more or
less casual and indirect. 7 There was
good work being‘ done;V‘11nde'r more or
less ‘diﬂicult circumsfances, but my
personal. services in those‘ years were
mainly devoted to the Western‘ Theo-
logical Seminary and -the ‘Pennsyl-

1886 I was chosen a Trustees of the
University. Prior to that time I had.
been little more than an obsVVerver.
now‘I became interested -in doing my
best to promote the good cause. V I
made jig my business to look. into
everything carefully.V $1 have never
believed that trusteeships are merely
honorary, appointments. V So long as
consenting toserve as a Trustees of.
an institution I have -‘held, and»-fl
think rightly that it is f,a duty; to give
to the institution as ‘much, thought
and j;carei‘ul attentionias is possible.
,I dognot think that lam singular in
this attitude, although I have.novi;V and
then encountered men, who seem to._
regard such ‘positions a.s being" held

In the spring of‘~the year 1891 I
was elected Chanc‘ellor of the ‘Univer-
sity ‘in succession to-’the. late l)r."Mi_1V-»
ton D. Goff of honored memory. ' Hav-
ing become ‘Chancellor -I ‘ set ‘myself
to work .more. assiduously thaneverv
to discover the University. In com-
parison with the University of today
it ‘was more or less microscopic in
size. The destruction, of the Alle-
gheny County Court House during» the
administration of ‘Chancellor Mac-
,Cracken—1rad led to the sale of the
buildings at the corner of‘ Ross and

tothe ‘transfer of the actualwork of
instructionjto the Seminary builtlings
on North avenue, ‘while new ‘buildings
were ‘being erected‘ on thegrounds of
the Allegheny Observatory. _ These-
buildings were nearing completion 
thespring of 1891. The entire stu-
dent body, when Ibecame Chancellor
was about seventy-ﬁve‘ in number.
(Seventy-six! exclaimed Professor
Reid '1‘. _S'te_wart). Ah! ‘ladies and
gentlemen, there is nothing like:hav-
ing an exact matchematical mind. We
‘all grant that to Professor Stewart,
and though‘ I said “about ‘seventy-ﬁv‘e"’
I am glad to stand here *in‘possession
of the"eV.xact ﬁgures, which have just-
been given by our ‘d‘ear“friend, the,
.Professor__ =   ‘  “

_Well, to resume! g I made up "my
mind that I would .endeavor to cause
the institution-_,to become in fact, as
.,it‘"wa‘s..already inname, a university.

greatest ever staged.

Penn State, West Virginia, Teclrandi
Washington and Jefferson. Compet-l
ing in a separate class at the same"
time will be the Freshmen teams of
the local college and universities,
and the leading preparatory schools
including'_Kiski, Bellefonteiand Mer-
cersburg. In still a third class will

‘be the high school athletes of . the _
'1":-i-state district.

This is the first
time that the second and third class-
es have' been .separated, but the
change was thought advisable’ in or-
der to place the competition on- a

more equal basis, and thus interest ~‘

more high school teams to compete.
Every year thousands of people ﬂock .
to the annual intercollegiates-and it

will be most fitting to-‘bring the,Pitt
Week celebration to a close. .
According to the plans worked out

the administration, a :button will be
sold to each student in. order-to
ﬁnance PITT WEEK. The success .of
PITT -WEEK will ‘depend almost en-
tirely upon the response of "the stu-
dents to thisj part of the program.

The committee has, -worked out a ,

budget which may be realized in full, _
providing thateach student purchases
one of these.‘-buttons -at one. dollar
each. ~ I. . ' —

‘Chairman I.‘-Sltewart wishes to an-

the expenses ’lncident—- =to PITT

than is necessary for the program as I
now outlined, t‘l__1e schedule of; events
will be enlarged, so that every dol-

The money received, the disburs'c-T

will -be under the direct supervision-

of non-athletic student activities," and

after the“ events are all over, the .

will. be taken toward economy of
funds and the use of good business

methods in everything connected with -
