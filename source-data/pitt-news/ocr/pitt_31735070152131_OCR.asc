Firefighters 31 responded to an explosion Thursday at a Dawsomstreet house leveld the biiclmg wit an excavate.

AThanksgiving Day explosion reduced a Cen-
tral Oakland property to rubble, but investiga-
tors say no injuries have been reported.

The second ﬂoor of a two-story house on
Dawson Street erupted in ﬂames at about 7:30
 Thursday. By 3[ a.rn.,lthe  Bu-

reau of Fire had extinguished the ﬂames and i
used an excavator to reduce the house to a_

near pile of rubble, neighbors said.

Greg Schaffer, 45, lives next to the house,
whichwas located at 3376 Dawson St. Schaf—
fer said he had just arrived home from work

' -when he heard a “minor explosion” on the

second ﬂoor of the residence.’ _

He said the explosion also damaged sev-
eral windows of his home.
V “It wasn’t that loud, it just kind of went
boom,” Schaffer said.

Schaffer said “the ﬁre came ragingout”

‘ after the explosion. He said he called the ﬁre

department, and the operator said ﬁreﬁghters
were already en route to the scene.

Interfraternity Council to ﬁne chapters for underperforming pledges

Sabrina Romano
Staﬁ" Writer

Mick Bauer, amember of DeltaTau Delta, said
his fraternity keeps anExcel spreadsheet that
lists the names of the brothers, their majors
and the classes that they would be capable
of tutoring.

Bauer said that the academic chair created

the spreadsheet last year, but the brothers
keep it updated. He also noted that the in-
volvement of his brothers in his academic
career extended beyond just grades.

“Older brothers who are engineers helped
me with class selection,” Bauer said.

While fraternities like Delta Tau Delta
already help new members academically, a
new policy for social fraternities will put more

pressure on chapters to maintain members’
grades. Interfratemity Council, the govem-

1 ing body forthe 19 social fraternities at Pitt,

instituted a policy this semester in which it
will ﬁne chapters whose freshmen pledges
have low grade point averages.

The average GPA of fraternity men is
3.024, while the average for all male Pitt
students is 3.042, according to senior Zach

Patton, the president of the council.
Summer Rothrock, Pitt’s assistant direc-
torofleadersllip development and Greek af-

fairs, saidinanernail that her office does not ' O

release information about individual Greek
organizations’ GPAS.

Schaffer said he hurried outside and began
to ﬁll a garbage can with water to put out the
ﬂames until ﬁreﬁghters arrived. I ,

Once the ﬁreﬁghters beat back the ﬂame
Schaffer said it was clear that the explosion
had blown holes into two sides of the house,
leaving it structurally unstable.

“When [the ﬁreﬁghters] got it out, you
could see through the house,” Schaffer said.
“That’s when they decided it had to come
down.”

The ﬁreﬁghters told Schaffer to temporar-
ily leave his home so they could demolish the
building, he said.

block of Dawson

GPA

low-average GPA among fraternity members,
Patton said the council will ﬁne chapters for
each freshman pledge whose GPA falls below
2.5 to create more of an incentive to focus
on academics.

The council will require each chapter to
pay $20 per freshman GPA for each tenth of a
point below 2.5. For example, a chapterwith
two pledges who earned GPAs of 2.3 would
owe the IFC an $80 ﬁne. M

Patton drafted this policy, which all chap—
ters in the Interfratemity Council must fol-
low, at the end of last fall semester when he
became president.

The council’s board members and chapter
presidents revised the policy before it was
passed unanimously last spring.

Patton said he is not sure how much
money the new policy will generate.

If this policy had been enacted last spring
semester, chapters would have paid $300 in
ﬁnes, according to Patton.

Patton was speaking hypothetically be-
cause the freshman pledges during the spring
semester are no longer in their ﬁrst semester
at Pitt and, therefore, are not included in
the policy.

“These numbers are skewed because the

pledge classes are about a quarter of the size,
and there are no ﬁrst-semester pledges,” Pat-
ton said in an email.

Patton said the policy only concerns ﬁrst-
semester freshman fraternity pledges be-
cause they have not yet earned grades at Pitt.
He said this policy will encourage chapter
leaders to ensure that freshman pledges do
not earn below a 2.5 GPA during their ﬁrst
semester with the fraternity.

Matthew Richardson, the coordinator

for fraternity and sorority life at Pitt, said ,

freshmen are impressionable.

“Habits, good or bad, tend to start in
freshman year,” he said. “As a council, we
can mandate new member education,” Rich-
ardson said.

Although it is unclear how much money
the council will collect in ﬁnes at the end of

this semester, Patton said the council plans to .

spend the moneyfrom the ﬁnes on academic
programming. The policy requires the three
chapters with the lowest GPAs to participate‘
in this programming.

The council’s board, not chapter presi-
dents, will be in charge of determining how
the money is spent. ’ .

Rothrock said she hopes the policy will

help to raise the average GPA of fraternity_
members.

“It is a good initiative for the Interfrater-‘7

nity Councilto work as a governingbody with
its member chapters to place high standards
on academic achievement,” she said in an
email. i 4 i V

Pat O’Donnell, the president of Delta
Chi fraternity, said the council can’t create a

' sweeping policy all at once, so the new policy

is a good starting point.

“We are startingwith the young members
because they are the ﬁiture of their chapter,”
O’Donnell said.

Although Patton said he wants to see
fraternity members improve academically,
he said that not all fraternities have below-
average grades. '

“There are some houses which have an
average GPA well above Pitt’s male average
GPA,” Patton said. ‘ ‘

He added that the three highest average

GPAs of individual chapters are 3.24, 3.35]

and 3.42. Patton would not identify which
fraternities he was referring to.

Gary Pike, a researcher at Indiana Uni-
versity in Indianapolis,published a study in
2003 forwhich he surveyed 6,782 male and

female students at 15 U.S. universities. Of ’

these students, 16 percent were members
of fraternities and sororities. V _ .

First-year Greekstudents who responded
to Pike’sr survey said they found their col-
lege’s faculty, staff and other students gener-

ally more supportive when compared to the
non—Greek students who were surveyed. Pike
reported no signiﬁcant differences in how
Greeks and-non-Greeks answered questions
about their own academic development.

Even before new council policy took ef-
fect, social fraternities already mandated
group study sessions for new brothers.

V Bauer, a freshman, said he chose to go
Greek during his ﬁrst semester at Pitt because
he expects the classes for his engineering
major to get progressively more difficult.

He had mandatory study hours from
Monday to Thursday during his pledge pro-
cess, which lasted from the middle of Sep-
tember to the middle of November.

‘ Like Bauer, other freshman pledges use
other members of their fraternities as an
academic resource.

Nathan Watt, afreshrnan member of Sig-
ma Chi, said he spends time studyingwith his
fraternity brothers. 7

When Watt and other pledges were con-

‘ ﬁised about e_conomics, abrother explained
the concepts to them. He said it was like hav— I
V inga private recitation forhim and the other

pledges. .

“I like asking [brothers] for help rather
than a [teaching assistant] _because I know
them,” Watt said.-I

    Corporate Black Friday success

result of worker exploitation

Natalie Russell
Columnist

People have criticized holiday
commercialization so often that
it now has the opposite effect it
aims for: It turns urgent issues -
like workers’ wages — into banal
ideas and thus, dulls any impact
on the already scarce national

_ conscience.

g The common argument
against the commercialization of
the holidays does not prove true
because while it focuses on the
corruption of self, it neglects to
explore the social consequences

Viof mindless holiday shopping.

Sure, appealing to the self is prob-
ably an efl'ectifve angle for Ameri-
cans carrying around their copy
of “Atlas Shrugged,” but perhaps
emphasizing the direct harm

   

that holiday commercialization
inﬂicts on others — speciﬁcally,
to the lower and middle classes ——
deserves more attention.

So ﬁrst there’s Black Friday:
an overﬂowing vat of greed that
spills onto adjacent calendar days
because of the “let’s see how much
we can get away with” nature of
capitalism. The empty title of
Black Friday now means that min-
imum-wage employees have to
clock in right after Thanksgiving
dinner, and that’s if they’re lucky
enough to enjoy the holiday at all.

The real kings of capitalism,
such as Walmart and Kmart,
opened at an ambitious 6 a.m. on
Thanksgiving, while other retail-
ers, including Macy’s and Target,
tried to maintain a semblance of
concern for worker’s rights by
opening at 8 p.m. Very few re-

   

tailers were closed for the entire
Thanksgiving holiday.

Most corporations were at
least merciful enough to offer
time—and-a-half pay for employ-
ees working under these hellish
conditions, which some have
argued cancels out the exploita-
tion. After all, Walmart is willing
to dole out some extra pennies
from its million—dollar Black Fri-
day proﬁts for workers who rarely
see raises, let alone living wages,
so everyone wins, right?

The enthusiasm of workers
grasping for time slots on Thanks-
giving and Christmas Eve sched-
ules is more telling of the ﬁnancial
insecurity that results from low
wages throughout the year. And
there is the minute cruelty of hav-

ing the minimum-wage cashier ring up your
big—screen TV and real leather boots, while
cheering at savings that come directly at
his or her expense.

In a macro sense, it’s unlikely that
shoppers save anything at all since a single
Walmart Supercenter could cost taxpayers
as much as $1.7 billion per year because of
worker reliance on food stamps and other

government aid programs. Meanwhile, .

December 2, 2018 | The Pitt News I \/vvvvv.piitnevvs.c0m

Walmart sits at the No. 1 spot on the For-
tune 500 list, with revenues close to $470
billion. CEO Mike Duke takes home $35
million per year, meaning he makes more
in an hour than the average Walmart em-
ployee makes in a year. The only one ben-
eﬁting ﬁnancially from consumer holidays
is Walmart. g V .

So the big banks, which hardly endured

‘ a slap on the wrist for tanking the economy

and saddling the lower class with -lifelong
debt, are now owed some thanks from the
corporations beneﬁting from the wide-

spread ﬁnancial insecurity that makes con-
sumer holidays so desperately appealing
in the ﬁrst place.

In a_ bitterly ironic approach that only
Walmart could fail to see, the corporation
even held a Thanksgiving food drive for
employees to subsidize the low salaries of
their own fellow employees.

It’s this kind ofexploitation that caused
tens of thousands of protesters to rally

- outside of 1,500 Walmart‘ stores on Black

Friday to demand higher wages, health
beneﬁts and the right to form a union with-

out the threat of termination. ‘
According to BlackFridayDeathCount.

com, consumer holidays are responsible

for seven deaths and 89 injuries. Seeing this

statistic, along with the 1,400 YouTube vid—-

eos of chaos, brings to mind a protester’s
sign outside ofjohn Lennon’s funeral: “Can
you see how stupid violence is?”

So before celebrating savings from
holiday shopping, recognize that these
discounts come at the expense of exploited
workers, while billionaire CEOS laugh be-
hind your back. I '

Panthers win
13th straight
City Game

~ Tyler Peoyna
' Assistcmzf Sports Editor

It was a familiar sight for sure: Duquesne
forward Ovie Soko towering above the paint
and standing at the free—throw line. Soko, a
6-foot—8-inch, 225—pound forward with bulg-
ing shoulder muscles, looked statuesque.

And with a little more than three minutes
remaining in the game, hewas eyeing the bas-
ket, toeing the stripe for the 18th time Saturday
and tryingto avoid missing the second ofthese
two foul shots. Pitt had broken the game open,
establishingalz-point lead at that point. This,
of course, came after Duquesne had stormed
back in the ﬁrst half. 4

Then Pitt weathered that torrid resurgence,
and the pace shifted gears foraDuquesne team
that aims to push the tempo, score points and
be aggressive indriving to the basket. It’s tough
to out—run the opponent when most of the
time you’re sauntering to the free—throw line
for points. '

“It’s tough,” Soko said of trying to sustain
speedy attacks with a slew of fouls and other
game stoppages.

“That’s what you saw us bank on, is be-
ing able to get stops and ﬂy back the other
way,” he continued, ﬂinging his index ﬁnger
forward to indicate that immediate transition
from defense to offense. “But when the game
is stopping so frequently, it tough to get that
ﬂow that you want to in the game where you
can use speed to your advantage.” .

“They shot 35 free throws [in total] ,” Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon said, thoughyhe wasn’t
pleased with the number of fouls his team sur-
rendered, noting that this many free throws
“slows down the tempo.” I

Pitt led by 11 with 15:30 leftintheﬁrsthalf,
but Duquesne’s comeback led it to its largest
lead of fourpoints with 6:42 remaining. In

Before the coin ﬂip that would eventually
lead to Pitt’s sixth loss of the season Friday,
most of Miami’s defensive players decided
to remove their tops after arriving in the
visitor’s locker room. They then bolted to
warm up on Heinz Field’s blistering-cold
ﬁeld shirtless. .

Miami’s antics were designed by players

to remind everyone on their sideline that

there’s no correlation between weather and
performance: Good football can be played
in both Pittsburgh and the tropical climate
of Miami Gardens. Miami hadn’t played a
road game north of the Carolinas this sea-
son until it was faced with windy, 35-degree
conditions in Pittsburgh on Friday.

“What does weather mean compared
to what they’ve been through the last 28
months?” asked Miami head coach Al Gold-
en after the game. “I think that maybe this is
a new breed and maybe a new mindset that
[our players] have. If some of the seniors

 spams

helped us learn that today, then that’s great.”

Golden was correct. The team collected
a 41-31 win in nontraditional ways — ones
that the topless Hurricanes hadn’t envi-
sioned.

-Coming into Friday, Miami posted 2.45
sacks per game. The Panthers brought a
batteredoffensive line into the contest: Left
tackle Adam Bisnowaty and left guard Cory
King, along with tight end Scott Orndoff,
were all sidelined because of injury.

Yet the line held its own, allowing just
one sack and enough time for quarterback
Tom Savage to throw for 281 yards and two
touchdowns.

Savage also threw just one interception to
Miami’s defense, which is now tied for ﬁfth

nationally in interceptions with 18. Savage l

threw the pick on a touchdown attempt with
2:02 remaining in the fourth quarter.

l “I think we just have to execute better in
the red zone and take advantage of getting
down there and putting some points on the
boar ,” said Savage, who ﬁnished the game
24~_::£-43,.

Saturday marked his sixth consecutive
game with 200 yards or more, but Savage
knew it could have been a higher number
had he remained consistent deep in Mi-
ami’s territory. “That’s too good a team to get
down in the red zone and not take advantage
of it,” Savage said. ‘

Coming into the game, Miami was ﬁfth
nationally in kickoff returns with a 25.87

’ average. Pitt’s special teams had come under

ﬁre in recent weeks for poor play, but the
Panthers held Miami’s return specialists to
a mere 18.4 yards per return.

All the while, Pitt’s kick returners
brought the ball out much ﬁirther when
kicked to. Freshman tailback Rachid Ibra-
him, who was also introduced as the team’s
third kick returner Friday, helped give Sav-
age and company decent ﬁeld position on
several occasions.

‘fl think he’s got the ability to do any-
thing,” said fellow kick returner Tyler Boyd
of Ibrahim. “I feel conﬁdent about him going

those nine minutes and 48 seconds where
Duquesne raced the court and poured in
points, there were 10 stoppages in play —
eight fouls and two timeouts —— which works
out to nearly one foul per minute.

“I thought we started playing more ag-
gressively,” Duquesne coachjirn Ferry said of
the ﬁrst—half comeback. “Offensive execution
helped us get back in the basketball game,
our forwards’ ability to drive the basketball,
to grind itbac .”

In the second half, though, when Pitt
pulled away, momentum stopped throughout
the period. There were 31 stoppages — six
timeouts and 25 fouls — in 20 minutes.

Duquesne head coach Jim Ferry said his '

team tried to sustain that ﬁrst-half pace, but
it was difficult to do so in the second.

“It’s the way we play, we try to maintain
it,” Ferry said. “The issue is Pitt plays veryfast
this year as well, so they can play at that pace.
They had some more guys to do it. You saw
us kinda slow down a little bit in the second
half. You saw some fatigue.”

That fatigue can be partially attributed

The Dukes used just nine players, whereas

Pitt used 10, an advantage for spelling play-
ers who need breathers and those who ﬁnd
themselves in foul trouble.

But sophomore guard James Robinson
said he didn’t think Duquesne’s speed posed
a challenge to the Panthers because they
matched the Dukes’ pace.

“They had what would be ﬁve perimeter
players out there,” Robinson said. “I think
w'e did a pretty solid job in terms of helping
each other ou ”

While Robinson answered the question
in a postgame press conference, redshirt se-
nior forward Lamar Patterson and redshirt
junior guard Cameron Wright sat next to the
freshman guard, their demeanors and actions
reinforcing the same idea.

The idea that the Panthers were somewhat
fazed by the Dukes’ quick-paced offense was
brushed off almostas easilyasthe second—half
scoreline shows.

“It really was just one—on—one and drive
you,” Dixon said to describe the Dukes’ of-
fensive strategy. “Obviously if they’re getting
to the free-tl1row line 35 times, we’re doing
something wrong. We gotta handle that bet-

Miami’s shirtless defenders who roamed

_ the ﬁeld before the game had prepared for

Devin Street -- not Boyd — to be.Pitt’s
primary threat at wide receiver. Street was
unable to play because of an elbow injury
suffered at Syracuselast week.

Redshirt junior receiver Kevin Weath-
erspoon was pulled during Friday’s game
because of an ankle injury, which put red-
shirt freshman Chris Wuestner and redshirt
senior Ed Tinker on the ﬁeld more often.

Miami defenders also watched Pitt junior
running back Isaac Bennett explode for 141

H yards on the ground. Ibrahim and freshman

James Conner added 73 yards to the rushing-
yards equation.‘ I - '

Bennett was averaging less than 60 yards
per game before then, and he had only bro-
ken 100 yards against New Mexico and Old
Dominion. »
