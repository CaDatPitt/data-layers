Crowds a

Discussion for Parents Students Voice Disapproval

Debates the Morality,
Legality of Marijuana

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

Should students be allowed to smoke marijuana legal-
ly? The consensus of the panelists at the Parents’ Week-
end Forum is that they deﬁnitely, should not.

Herbert McGibbeny, dean of men, cited the effects of
marijuana and said that “-hashish which some authorities
claim is ﬁve times more potent than the type found in the

United -States, has turned up for the ﬁrst time in Pittsburgh in a,
drug raid. This form is about as potent as LSD, which I haven't

4 heard anyone trying to legalize.”

“The marijuana found in the United States is a diluted fort...
ranking about ﬁfth in the world,” according to Dr. Douglass Thomp-
son, director of Student Health Service. “Actually there is not
enough proof of subjective and physical effects to say positively
that -the chronically insane users (especially those in foreign coun-
tries) would not be schizophrenics without using it,” Thompson
pointed out.

He expressed the idea of “chemical salvation” and chemical
dependency as societal weaknesses contributing to the start of
marijuana using. ‘

Robert Aarons, a social worker who works at the Homewooil
Addiction Center, spoke about the possibility of marijuana leading
to addiction on narcotic drugs. , "

He stated his experience with heroin addicts who had told him
they felt marijuana should not be legalized. “A person is more
likely to go on to stronger drugs if he uses marijuana,” he said.

Another panelist, Father Christopher Kennedy, ‘a Catholic
chaplain, stressed that “morality cannot be legislated. Parents
should avoid being overly strict so as not to produce negative.
responses.”

He also said that “feeling sorry for oneself is no excuse for

juana or alcohol.” .

Government (SG) senator and
the only supporter of legalized
marijana, said that “Inarijuana
is not just a student phenome-

non, and it is not just consﬁned
to the hippie movement.”

She maintained that it is a
question of individual rights and
should be open to each person

to judge for himself.

Miss Edwards also said that
“overprotected students, when
faced with a free college atmos-
phere use marijuana as a serach
for their own identity. To com-
bat *this education must be a
consciousness-expanding experi-
ment.”

The Pitt Student Union is presenting a ﬁrst

at the University in the area of modern entertain-
ment. “The Pit” Coffee House will have its grand

 
    

opening tonight at 8.
The Hunt Room will be transformed into a
Coffee House until Saturday when it will be mov-
ed up to the Ballroom for the beneﬁt of our
visiting Navy Midshipmen. The purpose behind
the Coffee House is to give students a place to
go for relaxation as well as giving them the
opportunity to listen to professional entertain-
ment presented in a very informal manner.

The main attraction of the week is “Grant
Robbin and his Trio.” Robbin has just com-
pleted highly successful dates at Penn State,
Duquesne, Ohio State, Western Reserve and
West Virginia University.

Robbin is a young composer, poet-lyricist who
has performed on nationwide American and
Canadian television as well as numerous night
clubs and concerts. Some of his songs include

dering the pool between the two  f

The demonstrators themselves P

were a varied age group. The
most predominant type was the

college student. However, the 

representation did not appear to

be a cross-section of the college 

community, at least not the Uni.-
versity’s. The students were, for
the most part, not hippies. But
at the same timenthey were not
a fraternity or athlete‘ crowd.
Most were casually dressed in

Levies or slacks, with work;

shirts, sweaters, and their equiv-
alents. ‘
The students there seemed to

have a oneness, a homogeneity V O 

that allowed people to meet and
talk on a close level of intimacy

Sociology’s J. Mareno
  Favors Rebel Cause

  In Dominican Uprising

by STEVE GI'I'I‘LESON
Dr. Jose Mareno of the Sociology Department stated
that he favored the rebe-1 cause in the Dominican Revolution.
Dr. Mareno lived in the rebel camp for six months, helping
in Welfare and medical programs.
Dr. Mareno began with a brief history of the Domini-
can state. After the assasination of Trahillio in 1961,
ending 31 years of dictatorial rule, the Dominican Council of State
set up in 1962 the ﬁrst free election of the 20th century.
Iuan Bosch was elected president. Bosch’s -administration lasted
only seven months for he was “accused of being Weak with the

Communists,” Mareno stated.

Bosch went into exile as the [Dominican Republic reverted to
the way it was before the election. All sectors of the Dominican
state were discontented by the ousting of Bosch and the forming
of an all-powerful triumvirate. Elections were again held in the
summer of 1965, Ma.reno -stated, but neither Bosch with 45 per cent
of the votes nor Balaguer with 55 per cent were allowed to return

to the country.

Revolution broke out on April 24, 1965, with many members
of the rebel organization, known as the PRD, inﬁltrating the army.

The Government fell immedi-

 ‘ ately Without any -opposition to
 the Coup by the PRD. Nobody

defended the trriumvirate, Ma-
reno stated that the Rebels did

 P not have a high degree of de-

velopment, but they did have a
high degree of solidarity. Ary
attempt to quell the rebels only
resulted in a further alienation
to the government.

Two thousand people died as
the military started bombing the
capital city, further establishing

- unanimous support of the PRD.

By April 27 the situation was
turning. .in favor of the rebels
and the loyalists would have
‘been smashed if the US Ma-
rines had not landed on. the 28th.

A ,, Mareno stated.

At that time Mareno spoke to
someone in the US embassy who
told him that the United States
government could not support
the PRD. The PRD wanted to
reinstate Juan Bosch, and the
US could not allow the Com-

 munist inﬂuenced Bosch to be

reinstated. The US thought that
General Wassine would make a
more stable leader even though
he promised to have a strong
dictatorial rule.

The rebels were soon crush-
ed by the combined forces of
the loyalists and the US Ma-
rines and were conﬁned to a
small sector of the capital city

. months.

He stated that the rebels had

Hoelscher
  To Direct
Space Center

Harold E. Hoelscher, dean of
the University's School of Engi-
neering, was named director of
the University's Space Research
Coordination Center (SRCC)this
week. 'The announcement was
made by Dr. David Halliday,
former director of the SRCC
program and newly appointed
dean of the faculty of the arts
and sciences.

Dean Hoelscher, who ca.me to
the University in 1965 from
Johns Hopkins University, will
assume his new responsibilities
immediately. In his position as
engineering dean, he has been

for a new engineering schgul

tary and social organization,
needed in their conﬁned exis-
tence. The rebels defended thei-
sector of the city with only the
crudest weaponry, and through
his six months stay, Mareno
stated, there was no lawless-
ness or disorder. The welfare
and -medical programs in which
Mareno worked were opened to
members outside the conﬁned
rebel zone.

Violence Begins at Pentagon Steps

who were more than adequately
equipped for violence. The most
organized of this faction was
something called “the North
Vietnamese delegation.” These
people came with particular‘y
violent signs and North Vietna-
mese ﬂags and stood together
in a group. Many wore sweat-
bands or armbands, and as they
marched, they moved with men-
acing step of people looking for
something, like the Nazi Storm-
troopers look in newsreels.

Another group, unconnected
to the “North Vietnamese dele-
gation” burned an effigy of John-
son after hoisting it into one
of the trees surrounding the
pool. As it burned, they attempt-
ed to lead the spectators who
had come to watch in shout-
ing “Burn Johnson, Burn!” But
the -people, disapproving the
spectacle, watched in silence.
Many were angry that the mood

of the march had been scarred.

The march itself began about
2:30 p.m. The demonstrators
were funneled between two lines
of marshalls that formed them
into rows of 15 for the walk
over the Potomac to the Penta-
gon. At the Pentagon, a hurri-
cane fence had been knocked
over by an early group that ha.d
caught the paratroopers by sur-
prise. This group had been able
to get up the very entrance of
the building before they were
stopped, confronted by para-
troopers with ﬁxed bayonets
and tear gas.

When the majority of the
marchers arrived, there was a
thin line -of MPs and Federal
marshalls between them and the

people who had been stopped by
the paratroopers. In a series of
small confrontations, the great
mass of the -demonstrators slow-
ly pushed the defenses back un-

Bus Driver Analyzes Riders

by DON MARBURY

“I’ve never met a politer,
more congenial group of
young men and women in my
entire life. I only hope they
like me as much as I like
them. This is the happiest
that I’ve ever been on a
job." These are some of the
reflections of George McIn-
tyre, the University shuttle bus
operator, on being asked about
his job.

“Georgie” is one of those peo-
ple who really cares about others.
“If a person has problems, 1
usually have them laughing be-
fore -they leave the bus.”

“Boy, when the football team
loses, I think I actually feel
worse than coach Hart,” Georgie
indicated. “It sort of gives me a
good feeling to know that once
I drive the students to their
destinations they're going to
learn something.

“I can't stand for anyone not
to like me. If I find out that
someone doesn't like me it will
worry me and I'll constantiy
find myself asking why,
what did I do or say.

“You know -if a person rides
the bus long enough I can tell
-their moods, like 'if they get a
bad grade, or have money prob-
lems. No one has ever given me
a hard time. Of course, there is
always an occasional wise guy.
but the majority of the people
on the -bus would tell him to
shut up. Besides being a driver
on this bus, I have «to be a book-
keeper—man, you should see
the 'paperwork—a diplomat, a
good mechanic, and a housekeep-
er—those peanut shells are mur-
der.

“Pitt is a great place, every-
one is just wonderful,” George
continued. “I wish I had a dime
for everytime I waved at some-
body walking down the street "

George is a native Pittsburgh-
er, “but yet," he joked, “I can't
drlve a. our very well in Pitts-

burgh and I get lost downtown.”
He’s been all sorts of things: an

craneman, tractor trailer opera ‘

tor, director of a. choir, and cap-
tain'of a baseball team.

“I’ve been with my boss R. J.
Woolf for six years now and I
love my job. Because of the
numbers of lives I have in my
hands everyday, I take ‘every
precaution in my driving Be-
cause I do this, when the bus is
ﬁlled -to the limit, I have to shut
the doors and -someone doesn't

make it. I remember once this’

happened, and I heard one of
the students call me a ‘creep.’
I opened the doors again and
cailed back, ‘Hey I resent that
remark.

“Occasionally someone will get
on the bus and ask how much
it costs to ride, and I’ll reply ‘a
nickel!’ They usually will say
something like, ‘Hey that’s pret-
ty cheap for a bus?’

“My favorite reply is ‘Yes,
but it'll be a dime once I get
my drivers license back!’ I don't

that leads up to the entrance
of -the Pentagon in an ascend-

feet high in the middle. Ropes
were thrown to them from the
first group already up t'heI‘E=..
and hundreds of the late ar-
rivals clamvberred up the ropes
onto the drive.

Meanwhile, on the left en-
trance to the drive, militant
members of the crowd tr-ied to
push through the MP5. This is
where much of the violence oc-
curred, as the MPs used clubs
and tear gas to hold back the
demonstrators, who, soon after
it was apparent they wouldn't
get through began to head back
to their buses for the trip home.

I won't

go into business when
I graduate because:

E] a. I’d lose my individuality.
E] b. lt’s graduate school for me.
E] c. My mother wants me to be a doctor.

Can’t argue with c), but before you check
a) or b)—pencils up! There have been some
changes. Drastic changes in the business
scene. But changes in the vox populi attitude
regarding business . . . especially on campus
. . . just haven’t kept pace. .

Take the belabored point that business
turns you into a jellyﬁsh. The men who_ruri
most of the nation’s successful ﬁrms didrit
arrive by nepotism, by trusting an Ouua
board, or by agreeing with their bosses. Along
the way. a well-modulated “No” was said.
And backed up with the savvy and guts to-
days business demands. _ _

In short, individuality is highly prized in
much of the business world—thc successful
much. Even when the business is big. Like
Western Electric, the manufacturing and sup-
ply unit of the Bell System. _

We provide communications equipment for

our Bell System teammates, the Bell telephone
companies. This takes a lot of thought, deci-
sions, strong stands for our convictions, (and
sometimes some mistakes. . . we’re human,
every 160,000 of us).

Individuality pays off. Not only in raises,
but in personal reward as well. Like an engi-
ncer who know deep down that there was a
better way to make a certain wire connector
—-and did. Or a WE gal who streamlined time-
consuming office procedures, and saved us
some $63,000 a year.

Rewards and accolades. For saying “No."
For thinking creatively and individually. For
doing.

Not every hour is Fun Hour, but if you've
got imagination and individuality—you’ve got
it made. With a business like Western Electric.
We‘-ll even help you answer b) with our Tui-
tion Refund program. Come on in and go
for President!

    A Responsible Criticism

THIS WEEKEND gave They also denied approval
for encouragement of “our
national leadership to persist
in our search for peace, and
to persevere in our struggle
for victory.”

Several Republic gover-
nors stated that the resolu-
tion did not belong in the
conference, since it would in-
troduce partisan politics. It
seems that partisan politics
didn’t bother the governors
‘at the last two conferenc is
when they approved a Viet-

Obviously, the war has be-
come more than a matter of
partisan politics. The gover-
nors’ reluctance to approve
the resolution on the grounds
that it was “partisan” was a
poor excuse to cover their
disapproval of the handling
of the war. Yet I believe that
it was a deliberate excuse.
For with this refusal to ac-
cept the resolution, they are
now formally representing
this country's agonizing in-
decision about Vietnam.

THEIR VOTE lent more
“respectability” to the anti-
war sentiment than any
march or demonstration
could have done. Eighteen
of the top men in the coun-
try have formally vetoed the
war. To be sure it was an
indirect vote, but the point
was made. If the governors

Tens of thousands of people ﬂocked to Washington this past week-
” end to demonstrate their opposition to the United States’ involvement in
he the Vietnamese war. At the national Governor’s Conference, too, the Re-
it publican Governors refused to endorse the Administration’s war policy.
 These two occurences can be overestimated or underestimated but
it? A should never be ignored, because they both reflect the growing accept-
_ ability of dissent against U.S. involvement in the war.
A One can argue the effectiveness of a protest such as the one held in
S Washington this past weekend, but that is not the issue at hand. What
, i does matter is that opposition to the war does not center around a fringe
 element any more but encompasses such bulwarks of respectability as
 The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and now Life magazine.
 We can nolonger _point to an organization such as Students for Peace
as an isolated example of people opposed to the war. We cannot even mea-
 sure opposition by the numbers of University students who don white arm-
 ’ bands every Wednesday. For activists are always in the minority. But the
 editorials written by the finest newspapers in the nation reveal that it is
 “no longer a minority speaking; it is a widespread group of people who by
« theirvery diversity if not their credentials deserve to be heard.

Th G °ng Dissent

As stated in yesterday’s New York Times editorial, “The real issue
is not whether there should be public debate in the United States, for,
indeed, there is no way in which it can be avoided. Nor can the pollsters be
stopped from sounding—and publishing—the opinions of those who make
no public protest.” We concur with this stand, believing that now is the
time for the Johnson administration to seriously heed the cries of these

dissenters and to listen to the sound logic espoused by critics such as

by Anne Dorn

year and the year before.

The vote on this year’s
resolution was indeed split
along party lines. But the
18 Rep-ubl'ican governors who
refused to admit the resolu-
tion were representing a
a viewpoint that had far
more priority than the tradi-
tional dissention between
their party and the Demo-
crats. Their cry of partisan
politics was only a surface
issue. What they were re-
fusing was their approval
for the current policy gov-
erning the Vietnam situa-
tion.

The marchers strongly be-
lieved in their cause, and
many are well-informed on
matters of the war. None of
them, though, have the cu-
mulative knowledge and re-
sponsibility of the 18 gover-
nors. It's natural a group of
approximately 8 0,0 0 0 pro-
testors attracts more cover-
age than a group of 18 pro-
testors. But these 18 are re-
sponsible men. It would be a
mistake to dismiss their veto
as strictly political play.

THE MARCH on Wash-
ington rightly deserves all
the publicity that it has re-
ceived. The Governors’ Con-
ference, however, must not
be forgotten in the uproar.
The very position these men
hold in our government
makes their war policy opin-
ion merit-ous of public scruti-
ny, by staunch supporters of
the war, as well as critics of

those on the Times.

We could not phrase oufr sentiments more eloquently than those ex-
pressed in the Times edit-orial: “There must be a Willingness to reach an
accommodation that reflects the military and political realities in South
Vietnam, rather than persistence toward the impossible goal of using
arms to destroy the Viet Cong as -an organized political force. Such a stra-
tegy would unite the bulk of world opinion as well as domestic opinion
beyond American policy. It would place Hanoi and the Viet Cong under
maximum pressure to negotiate a settlement. Any by its shift of emphasis
from the military to the political challenge, it would offer greater hope
for shortening the war.”

We could not agree more strongly.

. Cheerless Leaders

Silence in the Stands

by Nan Isen

IT IS a well known convention that when a football
team is behind, the fans want to yell at the top of their
lungs such sayings as, “Get rid of that bum,’ ’or “Hey
coach, “Why don’t you put in the ﬁrst team now?”

At Saturdays’ massacre, however, the crowd lacked
this mostessential element. They just stared at the field
or scoreboard, waiting, in fact even hoping for the other
team to score another touchdown.

To try to. understand this attitude, I began questioning
the fell-ow sitting next to me.

“Some game,” I sighed. “At least they could let us
score one touchdown.”

He peered over the top of his coke glass and stared at
me. “You mean you’re actually watching it?” he responded,
as he began guzzling hlis drink.

“Well yes, as a matter of fact, I am. If you’re not watch-
the game, what are you doing here?” I demanded.

“Hgll, you don’t think I’d climb that hill for nothing,
do you?” r

I shook my head no.

“Here, take a taste of this,” he said, handing me the
cup.

“Okay, so it has something in it, ‘big thrill.” Can't you
find a better place to get drunk ?” V .

“Sure,” he said, “but what better reason than over a
lousy football game?”

“Couldn’t you find some other way to [protest the
game? Something healthy like yelling at the coach or the
guy who dropped that last pass, or even the time keeper?”
I suggested.

“Yeh, I guess I could,” he answered. “But drinking is
a lot more fun. It helps dull the pain of defea .”

' A vendor came around, and the boy next to me and his

buddies bought a few more cokes, took out the bottle and

began rationing the precious rum.

“Oh, I THINK I see.”

“Look,’ he offered,’ “When you know the team is going
to l-ose, from the opening kickoff, why not just sit back and
relax and have a party. After all, it’s no use screaming your
lungs out,” he finished.

“Thank you for all of your information.. You have cer-
tainly been most helpful,” I said.

The game progressed into the last quarter, and still,
not a sound of protest was to be heard from the stands. As
the opponent’s score mounted, one brave fellow held up a.
sign saying, “Unreal.” Some people left the stadium, not
lookingiback for fear of the consequences.

Near the very end -of the game, the same fellow looked
at the score, then the clock, then at me. He finally gathered
up enough strength to wliisper, “How much do you want to
bet that other team wins by?”

aints Grim Picture

Of the Future Evolution of Mankind

by ANNE DORN

Dr. Frederick J. Gottlieb, as-
sistantlprofessor of -biology, pre
-sented a “grim picture” of the
evolutionary future of mankind
when he stated that the evolu-
tion of man’s culture has giver.
him the “capacity to destroy all
forms of life on this planet.” Dr,
Gottlieb spoke at a B’nai B’ri+.h
Hillel Brunch given yesterday
in honor of Parents’ Weekend.

He gave his audience his out-
look as a warning to this gen-
eration to do something about
the situation now. “We may not
be around when the piper must
be paid, but he will be paid. In
the 16th century, it was the
Black Plague. Today, mass star-
vartion could be the new plague.

Dr. Gottlieb explained that
with man’s incre-a:sin~g technical
and medical knowledge, he is
increasing the probealbilities of

spontaneous mutation, in addi-
tion to increasing the popula-
tion. He said that its been es-
-timated that 50 billion people is
the maximum this planet can
support. “This is 20 times the
present population, but the pup-
ulation is doubling every 20
years. We'll ‘be standing should-
er to shoulder. We have to start
anticipating now.”

Dr. Gottlieb also mentioned
the ways by which man artiﬁ
cially mutates himself. He call-
ed LSD an “instant suicide kit,
with a delayed fuse,” referring
to the way‘ LSD has been shown
to change the pattern of chromo-
somes.

To remedy the problem, Dr.
Gottlieb called for “-raltional'ity_.”
Since we have eliminated “all
natural checks except for war,”
rational ‘behavior is the only
means to keep the mutation and

Any red doggin’ American who appreciates the
added quality of hand-sewn* detailing is likely to
make a play for your Roamers. Just tell him that
both male and lady Roamers are built from the
same choice leathers . . . hand-stitched by the same
select craftsmen . . . and, for about ﬁfteen bucks,
he can strut around in a pair of his very own. How-
ever, for your dainty feet, Roamers are priced from
as low as eleven dollars.

HALFBAGK JOE MIRA, younger brother of former Miami standout George Mira,

 ‘genres his first touchdown of the day on a two-yard plunge. Mira, normally a. sec-

‘e

ondstringer, led the Miami offense with 164 total yards, running and receiving.

The lady with the red scarf on her head, stood waving her red and
white Miami pennant frantically and yelling, “We’re number one, We’re
number one.” And inside the visitors’ locker room_ after the Hurricanes
trounced the Panthers, 58-0, at the Stadium Saturday, Charlie Tate (in his
gruff manner said, “well . . . people get mad when you say you’re number
one.”

“But, we are a pretty good football team,” and the Miami coach
emphasized that word “good,” a Word which Dave Hart had little room to
use after the Jungle Cats suffered their worst defeat since 1947.

Tate did try to comfort Hart though, -after the rout had ended. Hart
had run across the field to shake the winning coach’s hand, just as he has
done so many times since he was chosen to rebuild Hitt football. Tate put

‘iris arm over Hasrt’s shoulders, and told him that he tried to keep the score

down; that he played his entire second string during the second half.

“Interceptions played an important part in the game,” Tate said in
the locker room. “But it went from bad to worse for them, and everything
turned to gold for us.” ‘

“We had thought that they were better defensively, yet we got more
points than we ever dreamed,” Tate said.

Actually, the Hurricane coach was only partly right.

The Panther defense never had a chance because they were behind
18-0 with ‘only eight minutes gone in the first quarter. Miami scored so
fast, the Cat offense was right back on the field. '

The whole thing began when the Panthers’ Gary Cramer attempted

ﬁe quick kick on the game’s first series of downs.

It was third down, eight to go, and Hart wanted to catch Miami
napping, but Ted Hendricks, the All-American defensive end candidate,
broke through to block the kick and then recovered the ball on the Pan-
thers’ 16-yard line.

 

ALL-AMERICAN Ted “The Mad Stork" Hendricks (89) knifes back to nab tailback

 iate inept Panthers, 58-0

MeKEESPORT’S VINCE OPALSKY rips oi! a 45-yard touchdown jaunt against
the- Panthers Saturday. The varsity’s defensive line was drawn in ion a third and
one situation, and Opalsky skirted around end for the six points. Miami rolled, 58-0.

Three plays later, John Acuff crashed over right tackle from the
four, and he had his ﬁrst of 'two touchdowns. Miami led 6-0, and it was
the start of the worst heating for the Panthers since Michigan romped
69-0 in the post war de-emphasis year.

Miami’s defensive team led by the 6-7 Hendliicks, who playedonly
in the first quarter and made eight unassisted tackles, stopped the Panther
offense. With minus 10 yards rushing in the first half it wasn't until the
ﬁrst minute of the third period that the Panthers could start on the plus

The backﬁeld ﬁnished with 59 yards net. George Pribish, who dis-
played fine lateral movements, had 28 yards net on 12 carries; Joe Mc-
Cain picked up 36 yards on six attempts, most of them counter plays.

For senior quarterback Bob Bazylak, it was an afternoon of frustra-
tion. If he tried to pass (he completed 11 of 31 for 113 yards), Miami’s
front five broke through the line and began chasing him before his re-
ceivers left the scrimmage line.

Bazylak, forced to run from linemen three to eight inches taller, con-
intuously overthrew receivers. Twice, Miami defenders intercepted his_
passes. And three other times, they inter-  .
cepted the passes of Frank Gutstine and
Jeff Barr.

The interception was Miami’s biggest
play. It resulted in 106 yards, and gave
them fine field position all afternoon. And

s 

WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?
Dave Hart was the picture of disappointment. His head
i was bowed and his eye seemed to catch every part of the
tiled floor as his hands ilidgeted with a plastic eating knife.

He rarely looked up as he answered reporters’ questions,
some of them silly under the circumstances. Yes, Hendricks
-, is a great football player, Hart would say. Yes, Miami is a

great football team, maybe even better than UCLA. No,
they Weren’t 58 points better than us. Yes, we made a lot
of mistakes, and our sophomores made the major ones.

p BUT HART’S FRUSTRATION wasn’t restricted to
Saturdays’ disaster. He was thinking of the wh-ole football
program, of how opponents like Miami could land players
, like Vince Opalsky. Opalsky was the game's Most Valuable

- Player, Two years ago, he wanted desperately to play for
’. Pitt. The school couldn’t admit him, but two years later he

could embarrass the school.
Hart was also thinking" of the day before, for it had
‘I been the day the bubble burst. The press, including this
newspaper, had built an aura of invincibiliity around the
freshman football team.

Penn State proved that Pitt’s freshman weren't invinci-
ble, simply by scoring a touchdown more than the Cubs
did. But Hart had often hinted how great it would be if the
freshmen could win all their games. It would renew the
interest‘ in Pitt football, so that more than 24,000 people
would come to Pitt Stadium on a Saturday afternoon.

IT WOULD HELP in recruiting and it would help in
. rebuilding the ‘healthy spirit of winning among the players,

the students, and everyone else.
But because the freshmen lost doesn't mean that they

  

 

   
 
   
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
  
 
  
  
    
   
  
  
  
   
  
   
 
 

they have failed in renewing interest in Pitt football.

‘ The freshmen have great personnel. But even great per-
sonnel have to practice. Penn States’ freshmen had Tuesday
through Thursday free to coordinate their game plan. The

for a «few precious moments.
f WHEN THEY SHOULD have been polishing their at-
V tack, the Cubs spent Thursday, the day before the game,

getting knocked around. The preparation for Penn State
' wasn’t adequate, but it was no one’s fault.
I There were other factors that hurt too. Hart feared
.' aloud" during the week that the freshmen were studying
late for mlidterms and the tenseness of the exams might
have an effect on the game.

Fullback To-ny Esposito was injured after he had crack-
edthrough the middle for 10 yards in the opening series.
His loss adversely affected the passing game as well as the
Cub rushing attack. .

LITTLE MISTAKES hurt too. With a Cub lead of 9-0
_ in the second quarter, an apparent touchdown pass was in-
tercepted by Penn State because a tight end, who wasn’t in
the play, ran his pattern into the ‘path of the ball.

_. There were a lot of “turnovers” in the game-. Some peo-
ple feel that they were inevitable in freshman contests.
Therefore, these people say, how a freshmen team fares
with its schedule is rarely indicative of the varsity players
.t will produce.
_ Maybe so. Maybe the job of the freshman coaches is to

the situation Pitt’s in, nobody wants to hear why you lost.

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa.
—- The Freshman football
team was upset by the Lit-
tle Lions of Penn State, 16-9,
here Friday. The Cubs were out-
played in the air and on the
ground. It shouldn't have hap-
pened.

“You lost to .a team that isn't
as good as you are,” coach Dar
rell Lewis told his players after
the game. “The only difference
between them and ‘you today,
was that they won and you
didn’t.”

Everything started out in the
Cubs favor, defensively and of
Iensively. In the ﬁnst quarter, a
strong Cub goal-line stand stop-
ped the only Penn State threat
and kept the score 0-0. Then ear-
ly in the second quarter, after
forcing the Little Lions to punt
from deep in their own terri-
tory, Charlie Hall plunged into
the end zone for one yard and 2.
touchdown.

The Little 1 Lions penetrated
into Pitt territory when half-
back Mike Smith swept to the
outside and ran for 48 yards.
But a few plays later, Lloyd
Weston intercepted to stop the
drive.

After the Cubs added their
final two points on .a safety, the
Little Lions reversed the trend
of the game. Jack Ham inter-
cepted a Mike Bannon pass and
then Penn State quarterback
Terry Stump hit split end Greg
Edmunds for 17 and 39 yard
gains. Smith capped the drive
with a four yard touchdown. run.

The Little‘ Lions continued to
control the third quarter. The
passing combination of Stump
and Edmunds and the running

of fullback Fran Ganter put the ,

Little Lions deep into Cu‘b ter-
ritory, but Bryant Salter, who
was playing his ﬁrst game at
defense, initercepted a Stump
pass in the end zone.

Two plays later, however, the
Cubs fumbled and State was
threatening again. A goal-line
stand, led by Weston and Ralph
Cindrich, stopped the Little
Lions from scoring a. touch-
down, .but Bob Garthwaite kick-
ed a ﬁeld goal that gave Penn
State a 10-9 lead.

Jim Colbert, another Perm
State quarterback, accounted for
the last .-score when he ran one
yard into the end zone after a.
12 yard keeper.

The Penn State rushing de-
fense hurt the Cubs. In the ﬁnal
quarter, Lewis used Mike Ban-
non at quarterback and at one
stretch called seven straight
pass plays. ‘

“We couldn’t rush any more,”
explained Lewis angrily. “How
could we when we couldn’t move

Nistorenko contributed three
goals on a variety of shots. He
now has scored 13 goals this
season, ten more than the entire
Pitt varsity.

“As a whole, we played like
we were tired,” said Schalk. “We
want to get back against Buck-

not just saying that. I think a

They can be as mad as they

The Cubs were credited with
minus two yards ‘rushing, as
compared to the 222 yards that
the Little Lions gained. Don-
Plusquellic, the scrambling Cub
quarterback who ran for 59
yards in 11 carries against WVU
was nailed for minus 59 yards.

Penalties also hurt the Cubs.
Four unnecessary piling-on pen-

alties gave Penn State 60 addi-

The Cubs were also penalized on

But what hurt the Cubs most
might have been over-conﬁdence.

‘Freshmen Roll To Sixth Shutout

men team remained “perfect”
shutting out the Little Moun-
taineers 15-50.

“We had to place ﬁve men in

said -coach Jim Banner. Banner

were proven correct as Hatﬁeld

The distancemen’-s Paul Greig,
Ken Lawton, and Paul Zink

experience.

In this “year of the freshmen"
at the University, the freshmen
harriers racked up their sixth
straight shutout of an oppon-
ent. The winner once again was
Jerry Richey. Over the same
course that the varsity ran, Rich-
ey’~s time was 21:25. This was
nine seconds better than Hat-
ﬁeld's and only 16 seconds off
the course record.

In second place, pushing Rich-
ey to his ﬁne time, was Greg
Rodgers. His time was four sec-
onds faster than the second

place varsity team. Following

him were Mike Nolan, John Cro-
zier, Mark Vornhagen, Jeff Wil-
son, and Bill Matajasic.

When talking about Richey,
Banner just beams. “He could
be the successor to Jim Ryun.
He deﬁnitely will -put lPitt back
on the map for track.” Asked to
compare him to West Virginia‘s
ﬁne runner Hatﬁeld, Banner
says, “Richey would run away

Stratford Wins Two

Dorms Begin Football

The dorm touch football teams

ing games Litchﬁeld blanked‘
Sutherland, 7-0; Stratford romp-
ed over ‘Keys-t-one, 20-0; and
Pleasure Palace handed Play-
boy's Penthouse a 31-7 trounc-
ing.

Action continued Thursday, as
Panther House quickly moved
-into the semi-ﬁnals of League
"B” with a 28-0 1 «an-king of
Litchﬁeld. Panther had drawn
a bye in ﬁrst round action.

The Panthers jumped off to
a iﬁrst half 16-0 lead after two
