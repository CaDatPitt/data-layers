'uled for the Panthers and the
seventh game between the inter-
sectional rivals.

_ Hoosiers Have Edge

Of the six games played Pitt

while the Hoosiers have won ﬁve.
The last Indiana victory was an

upset, 48-14. in 1949 when the‘

Hoosiers throttled the Panthers’
Cotton Bowl hopes.

The Panther unit—including 4}
gridders—left for .Bloomington
last night "and will return here

immediately .following the game."

_Team headquarters have" been
set up at the Greystone Hotel in

Stadium Drinkers On Probation

Two students who attempted to carry". liquor into Pittv
Stadium at last Saturday’s football game have been placed

on’ “disciplinary probation,” according to Theodore W. Biddle,

dean of men.

Mr. Biddle explained that both
men will bedismissed from‘ school
if caught in any more breaches of
decorum, whether by drinking or
otherwise. V

Two Were Expelled

The dean added that a student
who injured a coed in the stands
two years ago while under the in-
ﬁuence of liquor was expelled
from the University. . H

. Mr. Biddle explained the pro-
cedure followed by Pinkerton men

at the Stadium in dealing with *

students carrying liquor.

If a student entering the stadium
is found to be carrying liquor,’ he
is given the choice of surrendering
the liquor and entering the stands

The apprehended student’s name

If a student in the stands is ap-
prehended with liquor, the Pink-
erton men again give him a choice
of keeping the liquor or staying at
the game.

Causing a disturbance in the
stands also will qualify a student
for disciplinary action.

Preserves ,
Anonymity

By JACK MARKOWITZ
Who are the “interests” that

are trying to buy propertyin W
Oakland for the eventual be— _

neﬁt of the University?
That is the mystery which
remains , since Wednesday
night’s meeting of the Syria
Temple Association, at which
the Syria membership reject-
ed almost unanimously -. a

 
 
   
   
   
         

$170,000 bid to buy its proper-‘

ty adjacent to the Syria Mosque. '
All that could be learned con-
cerning the identity of Pitt’s po-
tential benefactor, the man who
bid the $l7‘0,0«0v0 is that he ‘is-"a
“philanthropist who is seeking to_
avoid publicity.” ' S
Mellons Were in Rumor

The possibility of the Mellon 

family being concerned in the

transaction, has been described’

as a “rumor” by a Mellon spokes-
man.

The -only man who ofﬁcially
knows.the identity of the bidder
is the president of the real estate

company through whom the bid.

was presented to Syria Temple.

But he is‘sitting on his informa-

tion. . _
The real estate operator, who
asked that his own name be with-
held, has said, that his client “was
deﬁnitely not the University of
Pittsburgh.” This quashes rumors,

that the University itself was the _
silent bidder. ‘ ,.

Civic Site Planned _
The realtor says‘ rather that his
client is a philanthropist -who
wishes to erect a building for the
use of educational, religious and

charitable organizations, which
would presumably include the
University. A

Whether the philanthropist will
continue his attempt ‘to acquire
the property, now occupied by a
parking lot, is a matter of conjec-
ture.

The Temple has rejectedfbids‘

of as much as $400,000 in the past,

however, and the present bid is ,.

only axfraction of that.
Mosque May Expand

_Further, the Temple member-

ship voted at Wednesday’s meet-
ing to investigate the possibility

‘of extending the Syria Mosque

building over the adjacent prop-
erty. ‘ '

By ISABEL LUBOVSKY
“The way our government
is handling things in the
Korean War will minimize

? the chance of a World War,”

is the optomistic View of Dr.

‘Henry S. Frank, new head of

the chemistry department,
who has returned to America
from a teaching post in Lingnan
University in China. .

He feels that if the United Na-
_tions can prevent the success of
the Chinese in the Korean War
it would be a blow to the Com-
munist world that might lead to
the Red’s downfall. - so

Commies Will Lose

Dr. Frank added, “The Com-

munists will lose because of the

are most stupid.”

I
In.l941 Dr. Frank had taught '

chemistry at Lirignan for '19 years

except for a few furloughs spent 

in America. When Japan invaded

China, and Lingnan University 
moved to Hongkong, Dr., Frank :_

attacked on Dec. 8, 1941. He was

turned to America.
Taught at Berkley

From 1942 to 1945 he taught at
the University of Berkley. In 1945
he left Berkley to head the China
Section of the Division of Cultur-
al Cooperation for_the State De-

Chinese Excitable
_ Dr. Frank contradicted the pop-

an impassive people and seldom
show their emotions. He said,
“They have a great giftfor enjoy-
ing life and are as quick to show

their emotions as any American.”
He observed further that the Com-

,__v4 _, .,..

munists’ are capitalizing on ‘this
emotional excitability. '

The Communists interfered in
the Lingnaneducational policy in
Oct. 1949 when they changed a

' required course of “Three Peo-

ples Principles” of Dr. Sun Yet
Sen to a required course in “The
New Democracy.”

After the Chinese ' invaded

* Korea in Nov. 19-50 the attitude

towards Americans changed. The
amiable Dr. ‘Frank was considered
a spy and his house wassearched
on the pretext of looking for radio
transmitting apparatus.
Papers Taken

Many of his private papers and
books were taken including a copy
of the “New World Symphony” in
which he had written some num-
bers simplifying‘ the playing. The
police officer that did the‘search—
ing thought it was a secret code..

Dr. Frank ‘graduated ‘from Pitt

in 1922 with a Bachelor of
Chemistry degree. During his un-
dergraduate career he had enter
tained the idea of doing mission-
ary work. When he was present-

ed with the opportunity of going _

to China for three years, he ac-
cepted. ‘

His chief reason for staying
after the end of three year term
was that he felt he could help in

“Two dangerous trends-——1ower enrollments and higher

Freshman classes are off about

many of whom are only part time

Losses Felt .

These losses are having drastic
repercussions in the ﬁeld of aca-

Only half of the independent
liberalarts colleges reported that
they were operating on a deﬁcit.
Many thought they‘ would “get

eating into endowment funds
against their better judgments.

Tuition rates have climbed . to
an all time high. College costs are »
twice as much today as they were

FLASH BACKS ._ .‘ .

Before World War I

.Let us forget the imrnediate‘present and ven-
ture through the years to the year 1910 and rem-
inisce about the Pitt of yesteryear.

University ofﬁcials bumped heads in those pre-
‘World War I days and came up with the bright
idea, of starting Saturday classes—mainly Latin,
Latin Literature and Greek. ‘ . ~

Pitt was celebrating its 125th anniversary by
devoting a day to listening to historic addresses by
“notables.” An intensive drive to raise $1,500,000
was then underway. All'of the speakers ‘noted it.

' Here’s one for the sports books. Pitt gridders
_stomped all over an Qhio University eleven 71-0
(no kiddin’). Ohio had- the ball only three times
during the whole course of the game.

v The County Commissioners. decided that Soldiers
Memorial was to be sacred ground~and that it
couldn’t be used for the ﬁner art of dancing—only
for social functions. Dancing isn’t a social func-
tion???3 ~ - ' -_

Pitt’s 1910 fall registrationiﬁgures totaled 1369.

What kind of a football team does Pitt have this year?

. ‘Last Saturday we-noticed‘

Lou Cimarolli, and Billy Reynolds, and the passing of Bob‘
Bestwick, if continued, should give Pitt its strongest of-

The defense left much to be
desired. In fact, for a while it
appeared that there was no de-
fense. But one thing which was-
noticed is that Bestwick was
getting much more protection
for his passes than last year.

Platoons Shufﬂed

‘Nevertheless, the defense must
be improved and Coach Tom Ham-
ilton knows it. He realized that

and sophomore gridders helped to.
spell defeat for the Panthers last
Saturday so his ﬁrst move was to
combine several members of the
two platoon units, in general a
deﬁnite switch from earlier plans..

For tomorrow Hamilton sin-
_cerely believes that he will ﬁeld
a stronger defensive unit than
last week. Fine. But his biggest
problem is getting the Blue-and-
Gold ‘up’ for Indiana.

After the Duke defeat in which

have won than lost, the setback
was hard to take. Before the
game the morale was high, the de-
featist attitude had been wiped
out, and student spirit had hit a

pointment of the Duke defeat.

Ernie Heﬁerle, who scouted

that if it were not for the sever-
ity of its schedule, Indiana could
make 1951 a highly successful
season. ‘
Smith, a graduate of Geneva
college, since taking over the reins
at Indiana three years ago, has

Pennsylvania talent and has gath-

And of course Pitt veterans
haven’t forgotten the last trip to
Hoosier land when the Jungle Cats
received a 48-14 lashing.

M.E.’s AT DU PONT
Diversity of chemical products spells

Students of mechanical engineering
sometimes assume there is little op-
portunity for them in the chemical
industry. In ﬁelds where products are
made in more or less standardized-
equipment, this may be so. .

‘But in a company like Du Pont

which operates in manyﬁelds of in_- —
V dustrial chemistry—where products

are made at pressures over 15,000
pounds per square inch as well as in
vacua low as two millimeters of mer-
cury—-mechanical engineers are in
heavy demand. ,

What jobs do they ﬁll at Du Pont?
Literally hundreds, not including the
normal run of mechanical engineer.-
ing work such as design of standard
equipment, scaling up from blue-
prints, etc.

For example, here are some of the
problems encountered in the manu-
facture of nylon yarn alone:

1 . Nylon polymer, 9. poor thermal
conductor, is melted by a contact sur-

-. l?.3s.nl3..f¥{'9. fo.

composes slowly at this temperature,
and there is a major heat—transfer
problem. .Many types of melting’ grids
had to be designed before one proved
satisfactory. ~

2. The molten polymer is pumped to
spinnerets under pressures over’ 1000

pounds per square inch. With nylon’

as the only- lubricant, the pumps must
operate continuously at 550°F. Spe-
cialized problems in sealing, gasket-
ing and materials of construction are
inherent in this operation.

3. The melt’ is forced through mul-
tiple holes (diameters of 7 to 22 thou-
sandths of an inch) in a special alloy
disc. They must begmade to conform

_ to “jeweler’s speciﬁcations.”

4. The emerging ﬁbers are cooled in a
specially designed “air conditioned”
chimney. Precise control is essential
in this critical operation. . ~

5.-The ﬁbers are wound on spools at
surface, speeds around 1000 yards per
minute. Design calls for constant

- change in speed so that there is no

localized stretching or relaxation of
the ﬁber.

6. Finally, the ﬁber is drawn about
400% and wound on spools traveling
at 5000 feet per minute. Bearing lu-
brication and dynamic balance, pre-
sented important design problems.

These are' but} a small part of the
mechanical engineering problems
arising in the manufacture of a single
product by only one of Du Pont’s'ten
manufacturing departments. Literally

all the way from cellulose sponges to
metals like titanium, present similar
