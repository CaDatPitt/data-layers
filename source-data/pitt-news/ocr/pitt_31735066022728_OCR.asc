Pitt’s five-year, $50 million
“Resources for the Eighties” fund-
raising campaign will pay for new
interdisciplinary programs in the
applied sciences and social sciences,
the creation of six faculty chairs
and five distinguished faculty
appointments, university facilities,

and expansion-» of the Student-

Union and Field House.

Ofﬁcially kicked off on April 15
at a luncheon in the William Penn
Hotel, the university is concen-
trating its appeal for donations
toward the major corporations and
foundations in the local area accor-
ding to Dr. Bernard J. Kobosky,
vice chancellor for public affairs.

Dr. Kobosky, who is in charge of
coordinating the campaign, ex-
plained that during the first part of
the campaign, the steering commit-
tee is soliciting leadership gifts. But
during_ later phases in 1981 and
1982, the “public at large” and

alumni of the university will be ad- .

dressed. _

The majority of the funds the
university hopes to collect by
l985——$35 million—wil1 be invested
in a series of new and unique pro-
grams that, in the words of Wesley
W. Posvar, Pitt’s chancellor, will
“expand the margin of excellence as
a great university.” These pro-
grams include $700,000 for a sur-
face science center, $500,000 for
development of the theater arts
department, $100,000 for the
university ‘honors program,
$175,000 for the chancellor’s merit
scholarship program, $2.5 million
for the modernization of scientific
equipment, and about $17.5 million
for 13 endowed "positions for
distinguished scholars ‘and other
faculty positions.

Programming Plans

By TERESA SOKOL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Program planning for the spring
and summer sessions is nearing
completion, said Assistant Director
of Student Activities and PUPC
Director Joyce Giangarlo in a re-
cent interview with The Pitt News.

Giangarlo noted that program-
ming for the spring and summer
sessions is “real low key” because
of the substantial drop in the
number of students attending the
university. past programming suc-
cesses and failures, Giangarlo also

sent into the front of a blue Ford
Econoline van parked directly
behind Orlando’s car. ,

At this point, a witness said she
saw Kelly sitting in her car with the
tires smoking. Kelly’s car was then
thrown into forward and jumped
the curb onto the sidewalk, where
she crashed into the front wall of
the S.O.D. bar at 407 Semple
Street, pushing the paneling intat
least two feet and knocking over a
radiator. '

said that most students were not
looking for indoor activities such as
ﬁlms.

‘ This summer, Giangarlo added,
major emphasis will be on a daily
outdoor cafe. The outdoor cafe, in
its fourth year, will have perfor-
mances by a variety of musical acts,
magicians, and palm readers, said
Giangarlo. The cafe will run from
May 19 through July 18 from 11:30
a.m. - 1:30 p.m. Singer Elaine
Silver will perform at the first out-
door cafe, said Giangarlo.

DAY 187

Kelly’s car bounced off the wall
and proceeded forward, crossing an

alley and striking another, a Chevy"

Nova owned by Karen E. Betler.
Once again,the impact of Kel1ey’s
accerlation caused a chain reaction,
sending the Nova into a 750
Yamaha motorcycle owned by
Ronald Barkey, a student at
Carnegie-Mellon University.

From there, the motorcycle and
the Nova were both sent into a Pon-
tiac Astre owned by Daniel Zorich,

which had been parked at415 Sem- . *1

Kelly’s car were so great that all .
vehicles, the two cars and the W

motorcycle, were sent into a Pon-

‘Real Low Key’ For Summer

PUPC member Jayne Kessling
said that lunch, at a small cost to
those attending, will be offered.
The Programming Council expects
approximately 100-150 lunches to
be served per day, added Kessling.
Every Tuesday, a salad bar will also
be offered. In the past, the salad

‘bar days have been “extremely suc-

cessful. ’ ’

The cost of lunches and the salad
bar is subsidized through the Stu-
dent Activities fee, added
Giangarlo.

An “international” cafe on May
30, ‘which will coincide with the In-

video programs, and some films are
being considered, Giangarlo said.
Not only is planning ongoing for
the spring and summer sessions, but
planning for fall term programming
is also nearing completion, said
PUPC member Kessling. Kessling
added that the PUPC has been suc-
cessful in planning events for nearly
every day of the fall term.

By SETH H. LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer
, A program that has come closer
to home in President Carter’s at-
tempt to balance the budget at all
costs is the National Direct Student
Loans program, which faces a
budget slash of $108 million, slated
to happen on July 1.
Original appropriations passed
by Congress and signed into law by
the president had amounted to a
sum of $286 million, but with the
‘budget cut awaiting approval by the
Senate, only $178 ‘million will be
left for the government to distribute
to the nation's colleges.
Authorized by the Higher Educa-

tion Act (if 1965, the government '

supplies funds to the educational
university from a capital contribu-
tion, which then lends the money to
the student.

At the university level, loans of

up to $l,250_ per year with an

University

overall maximum of $5,000 for
undergraduate education are pro-
vided to the student. Repayment of
the loan starts nine months after
termination of the student’s educa-
tion at an interest rate "of three per-
‘ cent per year simple interest.

If the budget slash is allowed to
carry, about 250,000 students na-
tionwide will be cut off the pro-
gram, or 750,000 will be drasticall
reduced. -

Lobbying efforts are concen-
trating on the Senate, where many
legislators haven’t made any com-
mitments on the student loan level.
However, according to one student
aid lobbying group, Edward
Blankstein, Inc., a clear majority of
the Senate do not favor the cut, but
the legislators have to justify their
votes by their constituency’s input.

“We’ve got to protect this pro-
gram,” said Gene Betro of the
Princeton, N.J. based company

a

ram'May Face Funding Cut
If Carter's Balanced Budget is Passed

which does the financial aid for
several schools in addition to lobby-
ing efforts on Capitol Hill.

Calling the mood to balance the
budget at any cost a “crazy logic,”
Betro said that by taking these loans
away from students “you put them
in the unemployment lines. ' It
makes no sense.”

“That’s going to hurt,” said Kal

_ Marks, chief of the Institution

Review Branch of the Division of
Certification and Review in the Of-
fice of Student - Financial
Assistance. ~

“The institutions will ,have less
money to hand out,” Marks added.

Betro suggests that recipients of
these loans contact their senators
immediately, through telegrams,
phone calls, or letters, because
“there’s real urgency in the
matter.” _ .

“Students should react as quickly
as possible,” Betros added.

Pitt And German University

Pitt and the University of

g Augsburg in the Federal Republic

of Germany have entered into an
agreement for scholarly coopera-
tion which will lead to the exchange
of information and personnel in
areas of research and instruction of
interest to both institutions.

The letter of agreement was sign-
ed by Pitt Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar, and is being carried to
Augsburg by the Hon. Ruggero J.
Aldisert, Circuit Judge of the
United States Court of Appeals and
a Pitt Trustee, who is teaching a
course in law at the German univer-
sity this spring. Dr. Karl Matthias

investment of $2.2 million will be
designated for an ambulatory care
facility.

As announced by Roger S.
Ahlbrandt, chairman of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees and chairman of
the campaign, ‘$16.5 million has
already been pledged, and an addi-
tional $10 million will be solicited
from 300 corporations that will be
asked for contributions.

Dr. Kobosky emphasized that the
new programs and expansions
“have no bearing whatsoever” on
the state appropriations used to
maintain a regular operating
budget, often held in jeopardy
because of legislative budget
deadlocks.

“These are programs that the

Meessen, president of the Univer-
sity of Augsburg, will sign for that
institution. ’

According to Burkart Holzner,
professor and chairman of
sociology at Pitt and one of the in-
dividuals instrumental in bringing
about the agreement, there has been
a great deal of informal contact bet-
ween the two institutions over the
past several years with many faculty
from each university visiting and
lecturing at the other.

“This agreement provides a more
formal framework in which to
develop .further international

state would not in any way" be

assisting us in,” Dr. Kobosky said. '

“They are programs and efforts
dependent on private support.”
"Robert E. Kirby, chairman and
chief executive officer of Westing-
house Electric Corporation and vice
chairman of Pitt’s Board of
Trustees, said, “The University of
Pittsburgh transforms our car-
porate gifts into one of the most
valuable assets any company can
have—educated brain power. At
Westinghouse, for example,
thousands of our employees are Pitt
grads, including three of our top
corporate executives.
Westinghouse encourage broad-
based corporate support of Pitt’s
fund-raising campaign because the
University of Pittsburgh is one of
our great resources for the
eighties.” .

cooperation,” Holzner said.

Augsburg is a relatively’ young
university, founded in the 1960s. It
is dedicated to creating new models
for instructional methods and
materials.

‘.‘It stands out among German
universities in that it has an ex-
perimental spirit,” Holzner said,
“and its faculty devote a great deal
of effort to the development of new
instructional materials and methods
of teaching as well as to research.
They have a number of outstanding
scholars in the humanities» and
social sciences.” Also unique is the

mandated class size—no more than
25 students in any class. .
According to Dr. John
Neubauer, professor of Germanic
languages and literatures at Pitt,
who has also been involved in the
agreement, plans are now underway

to create a series of seminars on

contemporary society. Faculty and
students from both the social
sciences and the humanities would
participate from both "institutions.
The site of the seminars would
alternate between the two campuses
each year. I

Posvar said, “This agreement br-
ings us closer to this sister institu-
tion _and opens new possibilities for
future cooperation. It also expands
and strengthens the international
scope of the University of Pitts-
burgh.”

Potential future activities refer-
red to in the agreement include: the
exchange of professors and other
academic administrative personnel
for courses and lectures; joint
research projects; student ex-
changes; and the exploration of
other areas of mutual interest in-
cluding theatre, music and sports.

Questions about the feasibility of
an increase in the Student Health
Service fee and a report on the new
campus bus route dominated the
Student Government Board’s first
meeting of the spring term.

SGB member Walter Burke open-
ed the meeting with questions about

the proposed Health Service in-

crease. Burke said that since student
monies are channeled directly into

the service, student input on an in-

crease should be obtained. Burke.

added that he did not believe many
of the students knew of the propos-
ed increase.- The administration
had proposed a six dollar increase
sometime during the winter term,

.Burke said._ _
Just what health services would

be cut if an increase did not go into
effect has not beeen adequately ex-
plained by administrative officials,‘
Burke also said.,

Khalil’s Restaurant. And, like the

V two previous chain reactions she in-

itiated, the Caprice was pushed into
a Buick Apollo, which rammed into

_a Ford Mustang parked directly in /

front of the Apollo. .
Kelly’s car finally came to rest in
front of 420 Semple Street.
Nobody was injured in the acci-
dent, but Kelly was hysterical as she
explained to police that her clog had
become stuck on the accelerator

_ and that she had blacked out.

The’ owner of the damaged

' Mustang, Regina Holt, said she was

(“afraid to come out of the

restaurant,” along with four other

owners of cars who had all been

eating in Khalil’s at the time.
Betler, the owner of the Nova,

said she thought it was “someone

shooting guns.” One witness stan- ,

ding 30 feet away said the car ap-
peared to be aiming for her, while
another said “it seemed like the car
was out of control.”

“The car went wild and it seemed
like the driver was trying to run

away,” another witness said.

One of the many tow truck
operators on the scene estimated the
damages to the cars alone will run
as highas $20 thousand.

noted.

SGB member Martin Bertocchi

this term. Bertocchi said the bus is
running on schedule, with only
slight delays during rush hours.
Large permanent signs indicating

Pentagon Given Orders  
To Develop New Rescue-

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON - President
Carter ordered the Pentagon to
begin developing plans for a second
attempt at rescuing the American
hostages in Iran within a ‘week of
the first, failed U.S. effort, ABC
reported Wednesday.

A well-informed White House of-
ficial, who asked not to be named,
said after the network’s report, “I
don’t know of any such plans.” He
added that he would not discuss
such plans if he knew about them.

_White House press secretary Jody
Powell has said several times that all
U.S. options remain open in the
Iranian crisis.

The network reported that while
there was no denial of such can-
tingency plans by adminstration of-
ficials, they made it clear they
hoped the need for such a mission
will be eliminated by the release of
the 53 Americans held in Iran since
Nov. 4. '

The first U.S. rescue effort ended
in fiery disaster in the Iranian desert
last month. Eight Americans died in
aplane-helicopter collision after the
mission ' was aborted due to
mechanical problems with three of
eight helicopters.

Since then, the Iranian ‘militants
holding the hostages have said they
moved some from the U.S. Em-
bassy in Tehran to various locations
around the country.

ABC reported that U.S. officials
believe they know where the
hostages have been relocated and
something about their surroun-
dings. They also believe a rescue is
possible, the network reported.‘

Unidentified officials told ABC
there are benefits to—the dispersal:

—Dispersal of the hostages also
means dispersal of their captors,

and a thinning-out of the more

violent element among the
militants.
—Commu,nications between

militants at the various sites are
poor, eliminating the necessity
for split-second timing by the
rescuers.

—An “unsaid by understood”
failure at one site would not
diminish the chances for success
at others.

Quarantine On
Virginia Aviary

Removed

By The Associated Press

WASHING'l‘ON—The Agricul- ‘

ture Department announced
Wednesday the lifting of a federal
quarantine imposed on a commer-
cial birdshop in Virginia after an

outbreak of exotic Newcastle”

disease.
The quarantinewas imposed on
an aviary in Alexandria, Va., own-
' ed by Kevin Smith, after the disease
was ‘confirmed in a parrotfthat died
in Camp Hill, Pa.

Investigation showed many other

birds had been exposed to the
' disease. Nearly 2,100 birds at l_2O
locations in 13 states and the
District of Columbia were
destroyed in the federal effort to
curb the outbreak. Federal indem-
nities totaling "$87,000 were paid to
the birds’ owners", officials said.
Exotic Newcastle is a highly con-
tagious and destructive foreign
disease of poultry and other birds.

Muskie Sent To State Department In 94-2 Senate Vote

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The Senate
on Wednesday voted to elevate one
of its own, Sen. Edmund S. Muskie
of Maine, to be the nation’s next
secretary of state. The vote was
94-2.

.The Republican minority joined
Muskie’s own Democrats in prais-
ing the former presidential con-
tender and respected veteran of 22
Senate years.

And Muskie himself rose from
the back bench Senate desk he first

occupied on his election to the
Senate in 1958 to say goodbye.

“Thank you all so much for what
you have contributed to my life,”
Muskie said. He was awarded a
standing ovation from his col-
leagues. V

Among those applauding was
Sen. Jesse Helms, R—N.C.,who said
his vote against Muskie was the
most difficult of his Senate career.

Helms said he voted no because
Muskie supports the central thrust
of the Carter administration’s

foreign policy, a policy which
Helms said he believes is “an un-
mitigated disaster.”

Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R—N.H.
also voted against the nomination.
Muskie voted ‘ ‘present.’ ’

Muskie told the Senate he
understands Helms’ reasons and
regards his vote against the Muskie
nomination as “an act of cons-
cience.” ‘

All others who ‘spoke heaped
praise on Muskie for his Senate role
in passing landmark environmental

legislation, for his leadership as
chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee and for the experience
he takes with him to the State
Department. A

Muskie’s wife, Jane, and other
family members were in the Senate
gallery for the speeches and the
voting. ‘

Senate Republican Leader
Howard H. Baker of Tennessee
called it “a wise choice.”

“I believe he will be in the tradi-
tion of the great secretaries of

AP International Newsbriefs

state.” Baker said.

“This is the moment I have
dreaded for 10 days,” Muskie said
as the time for voting neared. “Not
because of the vote but for the fact
that it means saying goodbye to the
Senate.”

Earlier in the day, the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee sent
Muskie’s nomination on to the full
Senate with a 12-1 vote after he pro-
rnised to be President Carter’s prin-
cipal spokesman on foreign policy.

The sole vote in the Committee
against the nomination was Helms.

Unfair Cut

In 1967, when Pitt became a state-related universi-
ty, undergraduate tuition was $250 per term. Since
that time, tuition has increased drastically on a yearly
basis. The sad part is that this trend will no doubt
continue for quite some time.

The administration claims that there is nothing
that they can do that would make an increase in tui-
tion unnecessary. They cite a high inflation rate and
low funding from the commonwealth as their main
rationale.

It’s not only tuition that continues to rise in cost
over the years. One must include room and board,
transportation, books and other supplies, as well as
any other incidentals that may be necessary for a con-
tinuing education.

Students have different options with which they
can meet these financial requirements. They can turn
to their families for assistance. Work, either part-
time throughout most_ of the year or full-time during
the summer, is another option. Assistance from the

government is also available to many.

One form of governmental assistance is the Na-
tional Direct Student Loan program established in
1965, its purpose being “to establish loan funds at
eligible higher education institutions to permit needy
undergraduate and graduate students to complete
their education.”

The NDSL program is in danger, at least in part, if
Jimmy Carter’s $108 million budget cut is allowed to
take place. This would mean that approximately 38
percent of funds made available for the program

, would be cut.

Although students realize tuition increases as being
a yearly happening, they should not suffer a cut in
one of their financing options.

President Carter’s slash has not yet been passed by
Congress, so students may still have hope. We urge
all students who may be affected by not having the
NSDL program made available to write to their
representatives and senators to act in their behalf.

  Pitt I-‘aces Gettysburg in Season ﬁnale

Gettysburg.

Future Looks Bright for Pirate Mike Easler

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pm News Staff Writer

After spending his first 10 years
in professional baseball shufﬂing
back andforth between the minors
and major leagues and four dif-
ferent big league clubs, one might
say things are starting to look up
for Pirate outfielder Mike Easler.

When the season opened the left
position was covered by veterans
Bill Robinson, John Milner and Lee
Lacy, and Easler was firmly entren-
ched ina pinch-hitter’s role. But
due to an ankle injury to Milner and
a “hunch” manager Chuck Tanner
followed while penciling in his line-
up card, Easler got his first start of
1980 two weeks ago against the
Montreal Expos.

The hard-hitting outfielder
responded by belting two homeruns
and four RBIs in that game, and
now, just eight starts later, Easler is
among the Pirate team leaders in
doubles, homeruns, RBIs and bat-
ting average with a .391 mark. Go-
ing into last night’s game against
the Dodgers, Easler had stroked as
many hits this season as Willie
Stargell.

It seems only fitting that in
Easler’s long and frustrating years
in baseball, he got his chance to win
a starting job in the majors for
something he didn’t do.

Despite a brilliant minor league
batting career in which he hit over
.300_ in a season six times and won
two league batting titles, Easler had
a grand total of just 57 major
league appearances before joining
the Buc’s last year.

Easler began his career in 1969 in
the Houston organization and hit
.300 twice before the Astros
brought him up in 1973. From 1973

to 1975 he appeared in just 27

games for Houston, yo-yoing back
and forth between AAA and the
majors. A

Houston dealt Easler to the St.
Louis Cardinals at the end of the
1975 season. The “Hit Man” was
assigned to the Card’s farm team.
At Tulsa, he went on to bat .324
and .352, the latter figure tops in
the American Association. For his
efforts, St. Louis sold him to the
California Angels in September,
1976 without appearing in a single
game in a Cardinal uniform.

At California things weren't
much better for Easler. He ap-
peared in 21 late season games that
year for the Angels and batted .241.
In April, 1977 he was packing again
when the Angels traded him to the
Pirates for minor-leaguer Randy
Sealy. Pittsburgh promptly
demoted Easler to their Columbus
farm team, where he hit .302 and
.330 in 1978 to lead the Interna-
tional League. Last year, as a
pinch-hitter for the Pirates, marked
Easler’s first entire season in the
majors.

What kept Easler going during
those long and disappointing years
of little opportunity despite his hit-
ting achievements? How did he
manage to continue smacking
baseballs over the wall when he pro-

bably felt like hitting his head.

against it?

“I just kept working hard and
never stopped believing in myself,”
said Easler. “I was always confi-
dent that I had the ability to play in
the majors. I knew I could make
it.” '

For now at least, the 29 year-old
outfielder is making it. Tanner cur-
rently considers Easler among -“the
four people who can help us in left
field” _and his eight starts this

..s. 

season are the most of any Pirate
left fielder.
' “I think I’ve made Tanner take a

different look at me now,” said.

Easler, “not just as a pinch-hitter
but a player who can do the job
every day, consistently.

“Since I’ve been in the line-up
we’ve had a good combination and
we’ve been making teams think,”
added Easler. “If I keep doing
good, then Willie (Stargell) sees bet-
ter pitches to hit. If they try to
pitch around Willie, I’ve been able
to hurt them.”

It seems puzzling that,
with Easler’s past credentials with
the bat, other teams were never will-
ing to take a longer look at the left-
hander earlier in his career.

Some scouts claim that Easler’s
weak point is his fielding, that while
his bat met all the major league re-

quirements, his glove and arm did _

not.

Easler prefers not to speculate
whether or not his fielding held him
back from sticking in the majors
before 1979. _

“In the minors, when you make
some mistakes and get a bad rap
that sticks with you, it’s hard to get
rid of,” he said. “Lately I’ve been
doin a good job, but I’m working
hard to get better.” '

Whether or not his fielding held
him back does not concern Easler.

He’s just happy to be here now.

“When you’re an extra man on a
championship team you just hope
to stick on and contribute. If
you’re unhappy, it’s hard to con-
tribute the way you know you can.
Youhave to love your teammates
and get along to fit in on a team
successfully.

Things are looking up for Pirate Mike Easler.

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team, winners
of five of its last six games, con-
cludes its season today at Gettys-
burg. .

Going into yesterday’s game at
Bucknell, the Panthers, (13-12)
needed to sweep their last two op-
ponents to stay above the .500 mark
and preserve their second con-
secutive winning season.

Last year, Pitt finished 14-6 but
head coach Bobby Lewis believes
the Panthers’ record this year is
deceiving because of the team’s
southern tour in early Spring, where
they were 1-6.

“Opening the season down South
has its advantages and disadvan-
tages. The team gets to play, but
it’s difficult because our opponents
had already played 20 or 25
games‘,-” said Lewis. “I don't think
the talent was much better than
ours but the headstart the other
teams had really helped them.

-“Starting the season 1-6 is also
difficult because you’re fighting all
season to get back over .500,”

Lewis added. “Since coming north, ‘

we’re 12-6 and have a chance. to
finish with an identical record to
last year’s.” '

One ' of the reasons for the
southern tour was to enable the
team to escape Pittsburgh’s incle-
spring weather, which
perenially plays havoc with the Pan-
ther schedule and outdoor practice
time. Out of 44 scheduled games
this year the Panthers were rained
out of 17 contests.

“Had we got in more games I

there fighting for the Champion-
ship again, only this year, nothing’s

North Star

By The Associated Press
BLOOMINGTON, Minn.—The
Minnesota North Stars are battered
and bruised from three rugged
games with the Philadelphia Flyers,

but -they’re still breathing and cling-'
- ing to life in the National Hockey

League semifinals.

“We’re not dead yet,” said Min-
nesota Coach Glen Sonmor follow-
ing a 3-2 loss to Philadelphia which
gave the Flyers a 3-1 advantage in
the best-of-seven series. “There’s
no such thing as automatic,elimina-
tion. They, still have to beat us.”

Game five is setfor tonight at the
Spectrum with Game six, if necess-
ary, back in Bloomington on Sun-

day night.

And the North Stars do believe
there will" be a sixth game.

“We won three games in Mon-
tre_al,” said Minnesota defenseman
Brad Maxwell. “So we know we
can do it. It won't be easy, but we
know we can do it.” ‘

Maxwell was involved in a fluke
play Tuesday night which resulted

in the Flyers’ second goal of the_

game. After a shot by Bill/Barber
had been stopped by goalie Gary
Edwards, Maxwell tried to clear the
puck behind the net, but it struck
Edwards’ skate and bounced in.
That" gave Philadelphia a 2-1
lead. Barber later made it 3-1 with

think we could have hit our current
win streak sooner,” said. Lewis.
“It’s difﬁcult for the players to
peak earlier in the season with a
lack of ‘playing time and it becomes
very discouraging to get rained out
when you’re looking forward to
playing.” '

Lewis added that, overall, he was
not disappointed with the season,
which he said brought some plea-
sant surprises from players Mike
Fitzpatrick, Mark Massa and. Tim
Moran. '

Fitzpatrick, a sophomore out-
ﬁelder from M_cKees Rocks leads
the team in hitting with a .383
average and was nominated for the
Eastern Athletic Association's
Player of the Month in April. Last
weekend, Fitzpatrick had 'five
hits—two doubles and three
homeruns—to help lead the Pan--
thers to a doubleheader sweep of
Penn State. In the first game, his
homerun in the bottom of the
seventh won the game for Pitt.

Juniors Massa and Moran also
played well against Penn State, said
Lewis. ,

"Massa made several ﬁne plays
against the Lions, and has been
playing excellent shortstop and hit-

ting the ball well all season',’_’~_h,e

.(..

said. Massa ranks second behind
Fitzpatrick in team’ batting with a
.306 average. '

Lewis said relief pitcher Moran
“has been like Kent Tekulve for us
whenever we’ve brought him in.”
Moran, who currently holds a 3-1

mark, pitched four scoreless innings -

against Penn State.

The Panther’s team next year will
be minus six players lost to gradua-
tion, five of them starters. The
seniors are pitchers Don Kollerand
Mark Bianco, outfielder Mark
Stevens, and infielders Duane
Sakanich, Chuck Mesiano, and
Scott Jenner. Lewis said he will be
looking for replacements at first
base, second base, centerfield and
on the pitching staff when the
baseball team begins fall practice.

Due to a conﬂict with final ex-
ams, the Panthers did not compete
in this year’s Eastern Athletic
Association Championship Tourna-
ment, which was held April 18-19.
Massachusetts won the double
elimination tournament, which
does not carry an_ automatic NCAA
berth this year. .

Lewis called the scheduling con-
flict “a -lack of insight, especially
when you consider that the league
only had to ﬁt the tournament

schedule around eight teams.”

his ninth goal of the playoffs before
Minnesota trimmed the final
margin to a single goal.

“It was just one of those things,”
said Maxwell. “We got our signals

The North Stars have been get-
ting their signals _crossed on
powerplays as well. They had a
man-advantage 12 -times Tuesday
night but came away empty-
handed. In the last two games,_ they
are one-for-27 on powerplays. h

Several of America’s best
tracksters enter the Steel City this
weekend, as the annual Pitt Invita-
tional Track Meet takes place at
Pitt Stadium Saturday.

The action, which begins at 9:30
a.m. with the track event trials, will
continue until noon. A one-hour
recess will precede the finals of the
track events which will continue un-
til 3:35 p.m. with the ﬁnal event,
the mile relay.

The field events will start at 10
a.m. and conclude after the inter-
mission with the ﬁnal event being’
the triple jump, which is scheduled
for1:15p.m. ' ’ -.

Pitt’s two-mile relay team of Dar-
ren Geary, Greg Conover, Joel
Albers and Terry Gallagher will bat-
tle atough ﬁeld of entrants after a
super effort at_the Penn Relays two
weeks ago. The Panthers placed
second in their second heat with a
time. of 7:32.0, a very respectable
showing, especially when one can-

siders that the Penn\Relays are one -
‘of’ the country’s most prominent

meets. Geary will also enter the
880-yard run as he attempts to
qualify for outdoor nationals as he
did for indoors a while back.

The mile relay team of Darryl
Baynes, Al Coles, Bud Cooper and
Larry Shippen also continued to
shine as they placed high with a
time of 3:14. They will challenge
East Carolina and Seton Hall for

   
    

top honors. V _ I , ’

Larry Kinney of Pitt will compete ' _ '
in the triple jump and also has ‘his 
sights ‘set on qualifying for na-“ ‘-
tionals which will be held in Austin,
Texas in June. Kinney placed ﬁfth,’
in the triple jump at the Penn” .
Relays with a leap of 50-0.

Gary Siriano, who ﬁnished 14th
at the Penn Relays with a time are
14:23 in the 5000-meter. run,  :,
enter the 1500-meterrun -on Satur-  V
day. Siriano will join Larry;  
Mangan of Penn State and a host of  3 ,
others in what should be a top- ' "
notch event. Mangan returns to de-. ._
fend his crown in that event.

Otis Melvin of East Carolina is " I 
one of many outstanding athletes." 
who will compete this weekend.g . ‘-
Melvin is the favorite » in the 
200-yard dash, where he placed
ﬁfth last year at the NCAA Out-
door Championships. 

Ulysses Cohen of Ohio State and  
Gamett Edwards of West Virginia V. ‘
are expected to go down to the wire ' V
in the 110-meter high hurdles. -5' _ _
Cohen is an all-America while Ed-,  -if

a little luck and some help from
above.”

“Who knows? Maybe in the next
game we’ll explode for three or four
powerplay goals,” said winger
Steve Payne. “It can‘ happen.”

“The law of averages is building
up in our favor,” Sonmor offered.
“Theoretically things even out and

' they probably will...if we can hang
around long enough.” '

. .Having beaten the Canadiens
three times at the Forum in Man-
treal, and winning their only game
of the semifinal series in

Philadelphia, the North Stars aren't
too worried about having to play in
the -Spectrum. '

“The. 3-1 advantage meansg  e_
something; the home-ice advantage _' A 3
doesn’t,’’ insisted Sonmor. g"
“We’ve just got to win three in a ‘
row now.” . ' I '

“I don't take _ anything for
granted,” added Flyers’ captain
Bobby Clark. “But it is nice to go
home with a two-game le'ad."’ '\

The North Stars, hampered by in-
juries all season, added two more,
players to the casualty list Tuesday.
Rookie Steve Christoff, Minne-
sota’s leading goal-scorer during
the playoffs, is questionable for ‘
Thursday with bruised ribs after be-
ing crosschecked by Andre Dupont.

8 Volunteers Reap Future Payoffs

Sometimes it pays to volun-
teer, even if the payoff is not
in dollars and cents.

For-instance, John Bach-
mann, a senior in zoology at
the University of California
at Davis (shown below), has
had four volunteer jobs at
veterinary hospitals. The ex-
perience not only helped him
narrow his career goals-he
now plans to become a vet-
erinarian—it also helped him
get a salaried job at a vet-
erinary hospital last summer.

Volunteering is increasing

al Center for Citizens Involve-
ment. Nearly half a million
contribute their time and
energy every year to tasks in
urban areas, rural communi-
ties, ghettos, prisons, and hos-
pitals. '

For some students, volun-
teering is a way to get a foot
in the door toward a paying
job after graduation. For
others, it is a chanceto dis-
cover new aspects of them-

WHAT COULD  

 

Drop your guard for a
minute. Even though you’re
in college right now, there
are many aspects of the
Army that you might find
very attractive.

Maybe even irresistible.
See for yourself.

MED SCHOOL. ON US

You read it right.

The Army’s Health Professions Scholar-
ship Program provides necessary tuition,
books, lab fees, even microscope rental dur-
ing medical school.

Plus a tax—free monthly stipend that
works out to about $6,450 a year. (After
July 1, 1980, it’ll be even more.)

After you’re accepted into medical
school, you can be accepted into our program.
Then you’re commissioned and you go
through school as a Second Lieutenant in the
Army Reserve.

The hitch? Very simple. After your resi-
dency, you give the Army a year as a doctor
for every year the Army gave you as a med
student, and under some conditions, with a
minimum scholarship obligation being two
years’ Service.

INTERNSHIP. RESIDENCY
8. CASH BONUSES

Besides scholarships to medical school,
the Army also offers AMA-approved first-
year post-graduate and residency training
programs.

Such training adds no further obligation
to the student in the scholarship program.
But any Civilian Graduate Medical Educa-
tion sponsored by the Army gives you a one-
year obligation for every year of sponsorship.

But you get a $9,000 annual bonus every
year you’re paying back medical school or
post-graduate training.

So you not only get your medical educa-
tion paid for, you get extra pay while you’re
paying it back.

Not a bad deal.

A GREAT PLACE TO BE A NURSE

The rich tradition of Army Nursing is
one of excellence, dedication, even heroism.
And it’s a challenge to live up to.

Today, an Army Nurse is the epitome
of professionalism, regarded as a critical
member of the Army Medical Team.

A BSN degree is required. And the clinical
spectrum is almost impossible to match
in civilian practice.

And, since you’ll be an Army Officer,
you’ll enjoy more respect and authority than
most of your civilian counterparts. You’ll
also enjoy travel opportunities, officer’s pay
and officer’s privileges.

’ Army ROTC Cadet and an addi-

Army Nursing offers educational oppor- _

tunities that are second to none. As an Army

Nurse, you could be selected for graduate

degree programs at civilian universities.

ADVANCED NURSINC COURSE.
TUITION-FREE

You get tuition, pay and living allowances.
You can also take Nurse Practitioner
courses and courses in many clinical special-

ties. All on the Army.

While these programs do not cost you
any money, most of them do incur an addi-
tional service obligation.

A CHANCE TO PRACTICE LAW

If you’re about to get your law degree
and be admitted to the bar, you should con-
sider a commission in the Judge Advocate
General Corps. Because in the Army you get
to practice law right from the start.

While your classmates are still doing
other lawyers’ research and other lawyers’
briefs, you could have your own cases, your
own clients, in effect, your own practice.

Plus you’ll have the pay, prestige and
privileges of being an Officer in the United
States Army. With a chance to travel and
make the most of what you’ve worked so
hard to become. A real, practicing lawyer.
Be an Army Lawyer.

ROTC SCHOLARSHIPS

Though you’re too late for a 4-year
scholarship, there are 3-, 2-, and even 1-year
scholarships available.

They include tuition, books,
and lab fees. Plus $100 a month
living allowance. Naturally
they’re very competitive. Because
besides helping you towards your
degree, an ROTC scholarship
helps you towards the gold bars

ional $70 a month (ser-
geant’s pay) as an Army
Reservist. -
’ When you graduate,
I you’ll be commissioned asa
Second Lieutenant, but not

necessarily assigned to ac-

tive duty. Find out about it.

A BONUS FOR PART-TIME WORK

You can get a.$ 1,500 bonus just for enlist-
ing in some Army Reserve units. Or up to
$2,000 in educational benefits.

You also get paid for your Reserve duty.
It comes out to about $1,000 a year for about 16
hours a month and two weeks annual training.

And now we have a special program to
help you fit the Army Reserve around your
school schedule. It’s worth a look.

A ssconn CHANCE AT COLLEGE

Some may find college to be the right
place at the wrong time foravariety of reasons.
The Army can help them, too.

A few years in the Army can help them
get money for tuition and the maturity to use it

wisely.

The Army has a program in which money
saved for college is matched two-for-one by the
government. Then, if one qualifies, a generous
bonus is added to that. I

So 2 years of service can get you up to
$7,400 for college, 3 years up to $12,100, and 4
years up to $14,100. In addition, bonuses up to
$3,000 are available for 4-year enlistments in
selected skills.

Add in the experience and maturity gained,
and the Army can sendan individual backto col-
lege a richer person in more ways than one.

We hope these Army opportunities have in-
trigued you as well as surprised you. Because
there is indeedalot the Army can offerabright
person like you. .
