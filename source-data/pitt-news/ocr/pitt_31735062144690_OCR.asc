system at -Pitt. »A _renaScence occurred‘ when registra-

all, the tribulations of the enrollment period. ' r
The ﬁrst of the innovations made its debut several
weeks ago in the form of preregistration privileges;
and according to ﬁgures issued last Friday, it met 
no’ little success. From August 29 to September 14,
inclusive, a-‘total of eight hundred juniors and. seniors
braved the routine of preregistration. And‘ they were
not sorry, for ﬁnal registration took but an additional
twenty minutes. In fact, so impressed were Mr‘. Quick
and his assist-ants with the improvement which the
new arrangement carried withit, that he intends ex-
tending the privilege to include sophomores and fresh-
men next year. » = .
Of course, the new system has a plentifulishare of
sharp ' corners which have already aﬂorded chronic

have been‘ heard about the failure. of preregistration
to eliminate the element of routine or the general
tediousness of one’s having to. go through the. well-
known individual steps. But the fault-ﬁnders might
have spared their energy had- they realized that every
novelty has its discrepancies and this one is no excep-
tion. With’tim'e and usage, preregistration should
prove’ an asset of inestimable advantage. .

sections 33 and 34 to _Hsectio‘iis ’-16

This arrangement was _mad_e'.to en-

put on by the student .body.., A big
blue “P” has been painted on the
student seating section to aid in the
colorful demonstrations; staged at
the big games by the university stu-
dents.‘ The sections formerly occu-
pied‘ by Pitt students will be re-'
served for visiting student;-s to per-
mit ‘both schools to plainlysee each
other’s demonstrations. Children
with their 25§ent tickets will again
be seatedin sections 8 and 11. .
The cheer/leaders under the di-
rection of Jim Scott, former Pan-
ther cheerleader, will have complete
charge of the cheering and displays
of Pitt students this year. Monday
evening at 5:00 o'clock all candi-
dates interested in trying out. for ‘a

almost exclusively with ‘incidents
and ‘personalities of the campus. In-

we are able to satisfy both Demo-
crats and Republicans.   .

early preparation at Camp Hamilton located in -the Allegheny mountains
where the Blue and Goldlcharges were drilled and trained in the funda-
mentals of football this fall. The fresh mountain air, the excellent food
served up by the famous Alex Williams, and the complete athletic equip-
ment of the camp all provided a real football atmosphere which aided
the coaches in conditioning the fellows. Two snappy scrimmages, three
hearty meals, one lon_g ‘restful sleep, and 9., rules quiz constituted the
daily’ routine of.the liuskies. ,After fourteen days of work-ﬁlled with
calisthenics, signal drillsgand practice games, the Panthers,retu,rned home

Six new rules were added to the football‘ code lastjspring but our
‘boys should know these and all thet-other‘ regulations perfectly. Rule
quizzes were held nightly at camp ; and the boys were given oﬁicial rule

men on the status legisaon the gridiron, Dr. Sutherland attended the rules

“city voters’ "one in the makeup’ of
[’the,Soviet. I . _ .
‘ There has been a rel_at1vely_s_low
v . improvement in economic conditions
“in Russia since 1921, the last two
. ‘years showing the inostad-Vance.
Russian people are very poor to-
‘-‘‘day, salaries varying from about
$29 a month for the average em-
‘ployee of the state to $500 a month
r ‘for important ‘business executives.
Q A-with college professors “receiving
about $100 a month and the experi-
fenced graduate engineer getting
_":$300_a month. Bread, especially
"rye bread, is cheap and certain
, services are free or graded by in-
 come, bup manufactured goods are
expensive and many sorts are not
available.
-P The homeless waifs are not yet
« geliminated, although great numbers
are now in institutions. The peas-
~ ants”: are frequently casting off chil-
dren and in spring many run away
from the homes. Nevertheless.
there are no starving or emaciated‘
people in sight. , The over-popula-
tion will lead to a recurrent famine
however, unless the very lar ‘e
b‘ ,th rate falls. It is falling in t e
ci y, but not very muchiamong the
peasants yet. _.
1 , About the Russian marriage, Dr.
* Johnson says that there i is more
-—:freedom in thesexual conduct of
women in -Russia than elsewhere.
‘T ~ re are unique and peculiar situa-

 
  

  
  

  

  

tio s in the sexual ﬁeld. Although‘

there is not very much promiscuity,
chastity has been abandoned. This
_ comes about because there are two
' ﬂlcinds of marriage.

_ Besides the registered marriage,
they have the unregistered marri-
age which is really the liason. In
the cities where the communist
party determines ethical standards,
the liason is in good social repute.
-In spite of idiscontentment among
the peasants and in Georgia, that
a counter-revolution is improbable
in Russia, Prof. Johnson believes
that Russia is rapidly making ad-
justments and that the stability of
the government is increasing. The
introduction of piece work and bet-
ter discipline in factories, the rais-
ing of capital by government bond
issues and increasing liberty to
foreign concessioners, have been
four of the most important relative
recent achievements that have

  made for its economic improvement.

 Johnston believes that the
‘ ctatorship of the proletariat” has
failed to Justify itself as a method,
but that countries should do their
experimentingi‘ with socialism in a
piece-meal and pragmatic way.

ing 1927-8 have been announced by
Dr. W. A. Hamor, assistant direc-
tor. The lectures, divided, among
eight different research subjects, will
be given in the Fellows room of the
institute during the fourth hour on‘
Mondays. ' " "

6' Dr. W. A. Gruse will begin the
series‘ -Monday with a lecture on
“Petroleum Distillation Practise.”
Dr. Gruso will follow this discourse
with two other lectures on “Petro-
leum Reﬁnery Technology” f,0ctober

>10 and 17. October 311 and Novem-

ber 7, Mr. O. O. ‘Malleisi will talk

‘on “By-Product Coke Technology.”

The remaining lectures include
“Technology of Ceramic’Product’s”
by S. M. Phelps, Tracy Bartholo-
mew, E. W. Ross, B. A. Rice and E.
J. Casselman, during November, De-
cember and January; “Manufacture
of Explosives” by Dr.  L. Cox
during February; “Paper Industry”
by Marc Darrin, March 5 and 12;
“Leather Technology” by M. C.
Walsh, March 19. and 26, and April
2; “Cereal.Products,” by R.‘ R. Irvin,
April 16, 23‘ and 30; and “Fine-

school grounds. This -condition
tokens serious carelessness and‘ ne-
glect on the part of the sophomore
class.” But nothing more was said
about the matter and it is presumed
that the freshmen returned toithe
straight and narrow path- it
' But time passed and the age
progressed. In a few» years, sin
 ﬂourished on the campus and
tl-.e traditional Cap Night, when
freshmen were emancipated from
the dink, took a bad beating. There
were long, protesting letters from
the alumni, but history is indeﬁnite
and obscure on what followed. Cap
Night was resumed and regulations
continued with more oriless sever-
ity until 1918, when The Pitt Week-
ly forgot that there was any such
thing as a freshman cap. -The
WeeI.:ly was winning a war. The
only certain sign of change, was
the abandonment of organized class
contests. - _
The class of ’23 was virtually
unmolested in its Yfreshman . year
and there was no sign of any lifein
its body until late spring, when Cap
Night was supplemented with a.
sophomore-freshman banquet. Some-
thing caught ﬁre that night, and
the class of ’23 started to make
history. The next year was a bad
winter for the freshmen. Deter-
mined to enforce the traditions
which had been almost obliterated
in their own case, the sophomores
rode down every recalcitrant fresh,-

. man and, incthe belief that  the

Student Senate was too anemic, the
Sophomore Tribunal was estab-
lished. The ﬁrst night of the tri-
bunal was celebrated by one of the
most famous class ﬁghts in the his-
tory of Pitt. A throng of fresh-
man_ rushed thesophomores in Me-
morial hall. Splintered wood,
shattered glass, and very black
eyes, bore testimony to the height
of the storm when day broke the

next morning. The sophomores won

the battle, but their tribunal was
squelched. The succeeding Cap
Night, however, was the most suc-
cessful in years. Comment on the
affair by the highest authority in
the University ran thus: “To the
members of the sophomore class, a_
vast amount of credit is’ due for
the success of the day. This class
has established a great deal of tra-
dition that will last upon the hill-
side after they are gray and dead.”

Then the librarian said it was
closing time. i
