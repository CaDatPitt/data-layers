University Prepares
For ’59-6-0 Initiation-

Four’ Undergrad Schools Ready to Oiifaeri

Spring Triterm to Freshmen, Sophomores

. By MILLARD AMDUR ,
Most schools in the University will be scheduledon a
trimester calendar basis in 1959-60. However, at present, only
the lower divisionslof four of these schools will definitely

offer the third,‘ or Spring, trimester.
Dr. David Henderson, director of planning,

advises that

certain problems’ exist in some graduate and professional

schools which must be resolved¢
before a completely_ unqualiﬁed
statement may be made. it

The Fall. trimester will begin
the ﬁrst week of September, the.
Winter, trimester, the ﬁrst. week
of January, and the Spring tri-
mester, the last week of April.

Actual trimestenoperation (in-
clusion of a third trimester) will
be in effect only in the fresh-
man and sophomore programs in
the School of Liberal Arts, Schools.
of Engineering and Mines, and
School of Pharmacy.

This informationyis included in
a letter to all faculty .members
by Dr. A. C. Van Dusen, assistant
chancellor for planning and de-
velopment.

. The office of planning and de-
velopment is coordinating imple-
mentation of the trimester‘pro—
gram.

From September 1960 to Au-
gust 1961, “actual” trimesters will
be in'.loperation in all undergrad-V
uate lschools. Finally, in Septem-
ber, 1961, all graduate and pro-
fessional programs will join the
undergraduate schools in trimester
participation.

- According to the report, sum-
mer sessions of 1959 and 1960 will
be unchanged from “arrangements
of recent years.” This refers to the
eight week summer school session
put into effect the summer of
1958,

‘Beginning with 1961, summer
sessions will be limited to meet
the needs .0! special groups such
as ‘public school and college teach-
ers seeking advanced study.

’.A planning committee has set

the tasks and time limits for each

which must be completed «before ,

the initiation of trimester calen-
dar. in 1959.

The -faculty has been assigned
the task of reviewing educational

objectives, courses, and teaching

methods. ,

Four speciﬁc considerations have
been asked of the faculty by
Chancellor Litchﬁeld. First, the
Board of Trustees has prepared
“clear instructions” for faculty
members to carry out a reapprais-
al of the University’s purposes and
programs, the design being to de-
velop this~University into one of

the nation’s outstanding ins_titu- C

tionsi.
As was reported earlier, the

"University will be visited in No-_
vember, 1960, by the Middle States,

Association. for evaluation pur-
poses.

The faculty has been asked to

state explicity the educational ob-
jectives and means for achieving
these objectives at this Univers-
ity.
“Most” "of the professional
schools will also undergo evalu-
ation at the same time in 1960.
Thus Van Dusen points out that
the planning for initiation of the

  
 
     

 

 

 

 

a

 

 
 

trimester‘ and the approaching _

visit of the-Middle States evalu-
ators necessitate a “candid con-
sideration of ‘educational purposes
and methods.” ‘

. The University hopes to identify ~
this study, which has been under- »

way in.the disciplines since last
spring," “those courses which do
not contributeto the fulfillment of
sound educational purposes.”

Today’s program includes scien—  

tiﬁc sessions and social events. '
The *' scientiﬁc program ‘began
this morning in..the auditorium of
VV e s t e r n Psychiatric Institute.
Speakers were Dr. John C. Rath-
burn and Dr. Joseph Stokes, Jr.

This afternoon -Dr. Stewart H.
Clifford, clinical professor of
"pediatrics at Harvard Medical
School and Dr. Lee Forrest Hill,
chief of pediatrics ‘of the Ray-
mond Blank Memorial Hospital
for Children, will speak.
