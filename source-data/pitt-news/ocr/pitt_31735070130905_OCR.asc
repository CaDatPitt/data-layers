Pitt students robbed at gunpointin Squirrel Hill

DAVE HARTMAN.
Assistant News Editor

- Two Pitt students were assaulted
and robbed at gunpoint in their
Squirrel Hill apartment Tuesday,
according to a Pittsburgh police
report.

Joel Protivnak and Stephen
Garich, both 18, told detectives that
two friends had just left their apart-

ment in the 5200 block of Beacon A

Street when three black men wearing

bandanas entered the second floor

apartment through an open door.
The men, two of whom bran-

dished black ‘revolvers, reportedly
threatened to kill the studentsif they
didn’t give them money. Acdording
to the report, the students were slow
in responding to the attackers’
demands, causing the men to3pistol-
whip both victims.

The report -states that only one
attacker spoke during the robbery.
That man, described as appro)timate—
ly 5-foot—6—inches tall and over 200
pounds, reportedly told the victims,
“I don’t want y’a11 to die.,I just got
out for murder.”

According to the report, Garich
then gave the men $4; the only
money he had on him at the time.

This reportedly angered the men,
who demanded more cash from the
students. ' O
Protivnak then volunteered his
ATM card, whichhe could use at a

machine down the street. The rob-it
bers told him to go to the shower and A

wash the blood off his head because
he couldn’t venture outside in that
condition, the report states.

Once inside the bathroom,
Protivnak closed the door, climbed
out the second story window, and
jumped over 40_ feet to the ground
below. The victim then ran about a
block to the Giant Eagle store at
1902 Murray Avenue, where he

called 911 fon help. I .
When police arrived at the apfart-

. ment, they were unable to locateithe
attackers. Protivnak was transported

to UPMC Prbsbyterian for lacera-
tions to his 3head and a possible
injury to hisjwrist. Garich refused
medical treatment.

Protivnak said he was somewhat
familiar with. one of the attackers,
but did not know the other two men.
One of the two men who did not
speak was described as approximate-
ly 6—foot-2 inches ‘tall, weighing
about 140 polinds. The victims could
not provide police with a description
of the third man.

Pitt students placedon   
auction block for charity

BEN RUBIN

 

5405 Fifth Avenue Pittsburgh, PAC { 5232 -

Staff Writer

Throngs of students packed
the ‘William Pitt Union Assembly
Room for a night of shirtlessness and
grinding, all in the name of charity.

Pitt’s Caribbean and Latin
American Student Association held
their fourth annual benefit auction
Friday night. More than 400 people
attended the event.

The room, temporarily con-
verted into an auction hall for the
evening, bounced to the hip-hop and
rap spun by two DJ s as 28 volunteers,
one MC and six audience members
were auctioned off for charity. At the
end of the night a few excited students
left with dinner dates. CLASA left the
auction with nearly $900.

According to CLASA
President Shaun Plummer, most of the
proceeds for this year’s auction will be
used to buy school supplies for an ele-
mentary school in Latin America. For
the past three years, CLASA has sent
Pitt students on their alternative spring
break volunteer effort to the Catherine

-Hall Primary School in Montego Bay,

Jamaica.

“We basically adopted the
school,” Plummer said. Many Pitt stu-
dents ventured to the school to help as
teaching aids, paint classrooms and
bring a multitude of school materials,
including over 200 books and four
computers.

“Every supply you can think
of, we brought for them,” he said.

Friday’s festivities were host-
ed by seniors Darryl Watkins and
Chaela Johnson. The two stood on
either side of the stage and encouraged
audience members to bid for those on
the auctioning block. The winning bid-
ders received a rose, a picture with
their dates and a gift certiﬁcate to a
local Pittsburgh restaurant.

Many surprises highlighted the
evening. V

Freshmen. Symone Redwine
and Lillian Mitchelle were sold as a
package deal for $115, the highest bid

of the night.

“We’ve been doing this for
four years and we never had a bid

- break $100,” Plummer said.

During an intermission, Karris
Frazier sang two Christmas songs --
“This Christmas” and “Have Yourself
a Merry Little Christmas”-— as the
audience clapped and sang along.

Many of the men strolled onto
the catwalk decked out in handsome
suits, but the greatest impressions were
made by what some weren’t wearing.

Wesley Hicks shocked the
audience by beginning to unbutton his
shirt as he walked onto the stage, and
then tossing it behind him to reveal a
Playboy tattoo inked on his chest as
the crowd burst out in frantic screams.
One audience member even came up to
the stage to touch the bare-chested
man.

Not to be outdone, Brandon
Williams stripped off his light blue
turtleneck to show his overalls top,
which he soon after took off while the
crowd screeched.

A woman from the crowd went
up on stage to undress Joshua Johnson.
Much to the crowd’s chagrin, Johnson
was wearing an undershirt. But, the
crowd was soon thrilled as he toreit to
shreds a minute later.

The three shirtless men raised
$95 for CLASA; about the same
amount fetched by the outrageous per-
formance of Johnny Michelot and New
York’s Pace University student Rossini
Celestine.

Johnson introduced the duo as,
“Two New Yorkers that speak French.
They are both offering dinner, a movie
and a massage.”

Their 10 minutes on stage i

started with both men ﬂexing and
shaking their behinds. Celestine then
began grinding the catwalk with zeal.
Michelot spanked the gyrating
Celestine as the bids rose to around
$40.

Celestine screamed, “Voulez-
vous‘ coucher avec moi, ce soir?”
which means “Will you sleep with me
tonight?” as he pointed at his crotch.
The bidding closed at $70 for the ram-
bunctious duo.

“I could have done more,”
Celestine said. “Next time the place
will explode. Kaboom.”

Watkins said he thought the
event went well.

“I think it ran smoothly and I
think the audience had a lot of fun,” he
said. .

CLASA booster and fund-rais-
ing chair Jennafer Howard said she
and membership chair Shellon Daniels
worked to ensure that every part of the
event ran smoothly. The two coordina-
tors typed up the programs, went to
local businesses for sponsorship and
even volunteered to be auctioned.

Howard and Daniels noted that
no one in this year’s auction dropped
their pants.

Plummer said the most impor-
tant thing about the auction was that it
beneﬁted children.

“It was great,” he said. “There
were some pretty high bids —- it was
packed —— it went real well.”

Police officer patrols
Oakland on two wheels

TATIANAZADONEY
Staff Writer

Officer Rick Troy never thought he
would ride a bicycle again. In the fifth
grade, Troy tried to pop a wheelie down
a steep hill when his front wheel came
off. He ﬂipped a few times, bruising
both his body and his pride.

0 “I never had a bike after that,” Troy
said.

His bicycle experience scarred. him
until he became a Pitt police officer in
.1993. And based on his experiences,
Troy is an exception to the cliche that
you can never forget how to ride a bike.

“That’s not true. You can get on the
bike and ride, but you need to regain the

, basics,” he said. ‘ O

Troy and Officer Carol Phillips
make up the current bike force at Pitt,
though he hopes to increase the size to
six ofﬁcers by spring. Pitt’s bike ofﬁ-
cers act as middlemcn between the
walking beat officer and the patrol car.

“We try to be where we can be seen

“to deter crime and focus on an area that

criminal activity has occurred in the '

past,” Troy said. .
A bike ofﬁccr can cover three to
four times more area than a normal

police officer can walk. In an‘ area like’

Oakland that has heavy traffic, it is cas-

ierffor bike officers to move ~around.A._
' because they can use- sidewalks and}.

A other shortcuts. .
“Bikes usually can go where the
cars can’t go —-alot of grassy areas,

back alloys.’-and',j'1bctv§:een ,ho11ses,’f; he 

said.
Troy gained. a new respect for the skill.
In 1996, he became certiﬁed’ to
train‘ bike officers through thc
Internationa1.Policc Mountain Bike
'Association.He_j now teaches a 32-40
hour bike course. .
.,The first two days ‘of training

I involve mostly classroom work includ-I .

ing bike maintenance and the basics'of

< _ riding a bike. The last two days of ‘train-

ing include cone maneuverability, dis-
mounts when pulling someone over and
ﬁrearm training.

Troy said“ he gives one piece of
advice to his students. He tells them
that they are‘ the sheep dog, the suspect
is the sheep, and the suspect will tire
eventually. There is no place to hide.

Troy is the only certified instructor

,beforé,” Troy said.

nce hé“ré-mastered riding a .bike,’”

in Western Pennsylvania and has
trained over 200 local officers. He has
also trained as far away as the U.S.
Virgin Islands, St. Thomas, Troy had

never been to the Caribbean before and _. I
had the opportunity‘ to - train the US

Federal Housing Police in 1999. ,
“I thought, ‘Boy is this going to be
great,”’ he said.

He was met at the airport by the‘

captain of the housing police and his
fiance. To strike up a conversation,
Troy asked about hurricane season, to
which they replied it was over and rela-
tively mild. 1

“I’ve always wanted to be in a hur-
ricane,” Troy joked with them.

On Saturday night, Troy learned
Tropical Storm L'cnny was brewing off
the coast, and the eye of the storm was
predicted to hit the island.

On Monday, he began training with

the fficers but when he arrived back at

his hotel room, he was notiﬁed to go to
the pool bar to learn about hurricane

precautions.

Hc trained again on Tuesday, but at
3pm. the governor declared a state of

cmergcncy. Anothcr offic;“er.told..iTroy to

withdraw as much money as possible

because the last time the island was hit-

by a hurricane, the island shut down for
a month. The hurricane ﬁnally hit on
Wednesday, Nov. 17, 1999, blasting the
island with“ 1,50_mph winds and torren-
tial downpours.  r '

‘ ";‘I_ watched the sea spit out so much
crap I never knew existed — giant ﬁsh
nets, .and creatures I’ve never seen

\

.. ~ ,With his wife Diane, Troy has three

‘children;‘Mc1issa, 16, Jacob, 9, and

Caleb, 5. He takes the children riding
with him, sometimes to Morraine State
Park to ride the Rails to Trails. The

pathway is comprised of more than
I 1,000 miles "of railways that havéibeen

converted to public paths for recre-
ational use. Recently, Troy secured $70,
000 in funding ‘for 40 officers from, 20
different police departments to patrol
the Rails to Trails.  _

He also teaches his sons how to ride
on stairs. Though he doesn’t reveal all
his secrets, he has mastered the stairs
behind Frick Fine Art Building, the
Cathedral of Learning stairs and the
staircases leading from -. Litchfield
Towers patio to the streets bclow._

“IfI have to chase someone, I want
to know I can do the steps,” he said.

Generations Together program unites young and old

“I miss her if she doesn’t come for a Pittsburgh area. At her school, Newman

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND

Staff Writer

Mrs. Hunter needs her trash taken out

The 94-year-old Pittsburgh native who
still maintains her own apartment in North
Oakland can only move with the aid of a
walker. Taking the trash down two ﬂights of
stairs to the Dumpster below can be an ardu-
ous and lengthy task, even if that trash is
only a couple of small bags.

Katie Weeks, 20 years old and much
more agile, is more than happy to help Mrs.
Hunter out. As the Pitt junior carries the two
bags outdoors, Mrs. Hunter watches her go
and then leans closely, sharing a personal
secret. '

“tea-I... _

week I love Katie to death,” she said.
Weeks met Mrs. Hunter only two years
ago. Since that time their relationship has

started an innovative program to partner her
students and their teachers with elderly resi-
dents of Pittsburgh.

“I sensed some-

Generations Together was started in

cipal for an “alternative school” in the

younger ones. -

is,” Newman said. “I think young peopleare

sensitive. They know the elderly have been

around for a while and really had something
to offer.”

In turn, Newman said, the elderly also
had much to gain from their young pro-
tegee. _ '
“Being partnered up with someone

gives the elderly a chance to learn about the
young,” Newman said. -“You know, MTV
and Rollerblades aren’t the norm. The elder-
ly are curious about kidsgin the community
and what’s going on in the world. The
young are their link to the outside.”

Back in the small apartment, Mrs.
Hunter says that the program acts as a life-
line to an outside world. »

“In the beginning, Sharon (a social
worker who worked with Generations
Together) said Katie would take me out to
lunch or go on walks with me,” Mrs. Hunter
says.

_ ‘ She nods at her, walker. “I told her I
couldn’t go out much. But Katie still want-
ed to come and talk to me once or twice a
week,” she said. “I didn’t know what to
expect Now it’s the highlight of my wee ”

On this day for instance, Weeks has
brought some pictures from her Halloween
party and a trip she took with her family to
see Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater.

“Oh look, that’s you, isn’t it?” asks Mrs. '
Hunter as Weeks, passes a picture from ,

Fallingwater. “And on the next picture  is
that Mason?”- I
“Yes,” says Weeks, nearly shouting, as

‘ Mrs. Hunter’s hearing is less than perfect.

Mason is Weeks’ boyfriend; He, and Weeks’
family have become close friends with Mrs.
Hunter. I
“We all had lunch here a couple of
‘weeks; ago,” Weeks says. “Mrs. Hunter

' keeps a picture of my dad on her piano. She

always says how handsome he is.”

Weeks, her friends and family have»

become Mrs. Hunter’s aides with Weeks
leading the charge. She often brings the
woman groceries such as milk or vegeta-
bles. Today she was supposed to bring some
tomatoes but the comer‘ grocery store was
closed. , A

“Don’t worry,” shouts Weeks. “F11 be '

sure to bring some next Friday when I
come.”

Before she leaves Katie makes sure all
the lights are working. One of Mrs. Hunter’s
pet peeves is burnt out lights, but many are
too high for her to reach. ,

“The goal of Generations Together is to
artiﬁcially create a young—old synergy,” said
Jim McCrae, the director of youth prograrn—
ming for Generations Together. “The older
adults work as mentors and the young can

‘serve the frail. Each haveneeds that can be
met by the other.” V

As Weeks leaves for ﬂie day, she gives

Mrs. Hunter a hug and promises to come
-back soon. Weeks walks out the apartment
door and points to a second story window.
