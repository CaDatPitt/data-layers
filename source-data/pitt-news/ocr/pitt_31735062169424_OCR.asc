‘Science’ Views Personality
Factor in Posvar’s Selection

by‘ ROBERT ZAVOS

The detailed story behind
the appointment of Dr. Wes-
ley Posvar as the next Chan-
cellor of the University has
recently been published in
Science, the Journal of the
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science (Feb- 3)-

This highly esoteric journal,
which incidently wrote a three

‘part series on the University 31'

most one year ago (Feb. 4, 11,
and 1966), seems to have an “in”
with someone in an administra-
tive position, for it disclosed in-
formation which had not been
mentioned in the Pitt News or

S the local newspapers.

In an article, titled “Pitt Picks
Chancellor: Agrees that Modesty
Is the Best Policy,” Science sug-
gests that former Chancellor «Ed-
ward Litchﬁeld “tended to be ar-
rogant in his dealings . . .
boring institutions felt little in-
clination to cooperate with Pitt’s

‘aggressilve leader.” Science re-

veals that an administrator said
Chancellor Kurtzman would have
been given more consideration if
it weren’t for his age. Anyhow,
Science suggests that a person
with a moderate temperment was
sought.

Furthermore, they say, “Pos-
var gives the impression of be-
ing modest and self-eﬂaacing: in
his tours at Pitt, Posvar dutifully
visited University officials in
their own offices rather than
having subordinates call on him.”

Science also says that “though
faculty trustees were willing to
elect a military officer, initial
faculty reaction was different.
‘Informal arrangements had been
made to circulate petitions against
him,’ explained Daivd Halliday,
dean of the Division of Natural
Sciences. However, initial anger
subsided within a few days.”

Science explains that on Jan. 8

neigh- V

Board Chairman Gwilym A. Price
brought Posvar before the fac-
ulty advisory group which was
aiding the Trustee’s Search Com-
mittee. They were not told his
identity until the meeting began.

They put him through a four
hour workout and asked him
questions such as his views on
academic freedom and -student,
faculty protests; They were quite
impressed at his answers and.
that he was a Rhodes Scholar
and that his wife was a Metro-
politan Opera star. The follow-
ing day the faculty advisory sub-
committee unanimously approved

his selection and one day later
he was officially appointed.

Science notes that the Univer-
sity became aware of‘ Posvar at
the end of December after a call
from Clifford C. Nelson, presi-
dent of the American Assembly in
New York. The extremely speedy
decision (about two weeks) was
due to the retiring of Gwilym
Price on Jan. 10 and the need for
a permanent chancellor in order
for Pitt to shift back into high
gear academically.

According to Dean Parker Enwright, last year’s pro-_'

gram was quite a success, and this year’s improved—coverage‘
system should be even more so. Students who donate one pint of
blood will "be provided with complete coverage for one year for any
blood needs that the donor’s wife, children, or parents may incur;

Public Affairs Topic

When Do You Die?  

The Public Affairs Committee of the Student Union
and the University’s Medical School will co-sponsor a lec-
ture by Rev. Christian Hovde, Ph.D., an Episcopal minister
and a doctor of anatomy and physiology tomorrow at noon
in the SU Supper Room. Hovde will speak on “Death—When
Does It Really Occur ?”, probing the question from the eth-
ical, medical, and legal points of view.

Rev. Hovde is director of the Bishop Anderson Foundation in
Chicago, an organization which attempts to bring medicine and reli-
gion "into closer contact. He is concerned with the emergence of “ma-

chine medicine-’,”a the artiﬁcial
life-savings devices such as the
artiﬁcial heart, and its religious
implications. He deals with ques-
tions as “Should everyone have

use of these life-saving devices,

even, the hopeless patient?” and

“Does a person die when his real
heart stops, or when,‘ with an
artiﬁcial heart, death is due to
other causes?”

Following the lecture, Rev.
Hovde will participate in a for-
um and coffee hour at 3 p.m. in
the SU Lower Lounge. Taking
part in the forum with Rev. Hov-
de will be Dr. Peter Safar, M.D.,
professor of anathesiology at the
University and director of the

  Greek Organizations
Will Again Sponsor f
  Blood Donation Drive 

by LEWIS M. TAFFER

The University’s Greeks are again sponsoring a blood‘
donation drive for this year’s Greek Week social service»
project. This year’s co-chairmen are Adele Scharf 

  
   
 
  
  
    
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
   
   
  
   
  
 
 
  
  
  
   
   
 
  
    
  
  
   
  
     
  
  
  
 
   
  
  
   
 
 
  
  
  
 

_\a

University may still be eligible -_
for coverage for three years._
Other donors Whose blood for‘ '.
some reason is not acceptable.
may still share all the beneﬁts‘:
of the plan. Dean Enwright com-'
mented that blood seekers often.
pay as much as $50 for one pint
of blood. ‘ .3;

The Inter-Pan Donor Club op.-s 
erates as a contributor" to the
Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh. ‘
Through this consolidating organ,
the University’s donors provide .
a high percentage of much-need .. 1
ed blood to 19 Pittsburgh hos-
pitals, the Hemophilia Founda-
tion, and charity cases. .

Dean Enwright noted that there
seems to be a “certain mystique”
concerning the donation of blood-. 
He reiterated the countless state?
ments of doctors conﬁrming the: *
negligible effects of the body's
loss of one pint of blood since the
human system contains at least ,_
one and one-half pints in excess. - 7'
“Blood is a medical commodity
like any other except it cannot
be produced synthetically,” he
added.

The blood donation drive will
take place Monday from 9 a.m. ..
to -5 p.m. in the SU Ballroom; ’
Special arrangements may be 3
made for those students not able
to donate at this time. With the
University’s enlarged Greek sys- 
tem and a hopefully greater turn-  ‘
out from non—Greek students, 
Dean Enwright speculated that S. 
this year’s Inter-Pan blood drive ..
should provide an even greater
service to our community with
increased beneﬁts for donors.

Police Arrest T

In Shadyside

According to a University
spokesman, several University
students were arrested early Sat-
urday morning on charges of vis-
iting a disorderly house. The stu-
dents, whose names were not re-
leased, each paid a $10 forfeit
and will not ‘be required to ap-
pear before a Magistrate’s hear-
ing.

The police who raided the

apartment at 422 S. Aiken Ave. .

arrested 54 persons. Only Frank
B. Goldsmith, the resident of the
apartment, was held in custody.
He was charged with keeping a,
disorderly house, violating the
Dangerous Drug and Cosmetic
Act, violating the -state‘ liquor
laws, and corrupting the morals
of a minor. Not all of the other

Dynamics Corporation is one of the
largest and most sophisticated
aerospace and research ‘firms in the
country. It was formed in 1965 through
the merger of two divisions of General,
Dynamics: the old Convair Division and the
Astronautics Division, both in San Diego. ‘
The heritage of Convair dates back to
aircraft production prior to and during‘
World War II. In recent years the former
Convair Division produced the Air Force
F-102 and F-1_06 jet interceptors, the 880
and 990 iet transports, and the Little Joe
solid rocket booster. The Astronautics
Division was the home of the Atlas, the first
free-world ICBM, and the subsequent
development of the Atlas as one of the
nation's maior space launch vehicles;
many other aerospace and research
programs were undertaken by Astronautics
i including Centaur—the first U.S. space
rocket powered by liquid hydrogen.

If you’re in the mood for some
fun, and not the Virginia Wolf
type of fun, I suggest you see A
Funny Think Happened on the
Way to the Forum, currently
showing at the Forum Theater in
Squirrel Hill.

The humor we ﬁnd in Forum is
of a slapstick variety and high-.1
lights in its cast, among others,
Buster Keaton, the kind of slap-
stick. Also in the cast are Phil
“Bilko” Silvers, typically cast as
a dealer in ‘female slaves, and
Zero Mostel. ‘

‘ The place is the Roman Forum;
the time, the ﬁrst century AD.
We see a wealthy boy, accom-
panied by his father’s slave (Mos-
tel), going to Bilko’s establish-
ment to ﬁnd a wife. It seems
like the girl whom the boy de-

‘sires has already been sold to a
Roman captain. The plot revolves
around the boy, who wants the
girl, Mostel, who plans to get her,
and the captain, who actually
owns her. This is .a thin line

Pitt Ne_<wis~/Recuieéw in

around which the play revolves,
and, if not for , two important
factors, the play would not re-
volve at all.

What keeps this show moving
is Zero Mostel. His antics are
hilarious. He is a clown, con-
trolling the audience with his
expressioned face. He puffs his
face into an oblong shape; he
makes his eyes appear to roll
like the windows of a “one-arm-
ed—bandit"’; he forms a pityful
expression by drooping his mouth
like a. sad droopy dog—he is a
master of pantomime.

Co-starring with Mostel, we
have not another actor, but a
director-—Richard Lestern. Known
for his previous movies: A,Hard
Day’s Night and The Knack, Les-
ter’s imaginative editing is once
again visible in Forum. Sudden-
ly, the characters move in slow
motion; then, they move in even
slower, stopped motion. In some
scenes we see the 'run-of-the-
mill, crystal clear “Color by De-
lux”; in others, the picture is
blurred, and a somber mood is
created.

Special Features and Attractions
Convair offers outstanding fringe benefits
including an Employee Savings and Stock
Investment Plan to which the Company
contributes as well as a Retirement Plan
and Tuition Assistance Programs. Convair
engineers can select from many company-
sponsored educational assistance pro-
grams and determine for themselves which
is best suited to their particular require-
ments. These programs, held in conjunction
with four highly rated local colleges and
universities, include a tuition refund plan,
an irregular work week to permit college
attendance, an advanced-deg ree work-
study program, special courses and
seminars, and Doctoral Fellowships,
among others.

One of the nice things about working at
Convair is living in San Diego. . . one ofthe
country's truly great resort centers. With
only 10 degrees difference between Janu-
ary and July highs, the sunny San Diego
climate is pleasant throughout the year.

Two great bays and 70 miles of ocean
beaches provide all year aquatic sports
and fishing.Exciting Mexico is just a few
miles away. Nearby mountains, a world-
famous zoo, and a marine park add to the
fun . . . plus 64 golfcourses for year ’round
play. San Diego is an ideal family city with
excellent schools. As the country's 16th
largest city, San Diego offers the best in
cultural attractions, performing arts, pro-
fessional sports, and other entertainment.

A funny thing is happening at

the Forum ‘theater. People are -.

for once leaving the theater with.

a smile on their faces. There are’ "

few good movies these days which
tell a happy story—no strings at-
tached., For just this reason,

many people have recently been" ‘

added bonus, the artistry of Rich- 6

said the program has suc-

ceeded in reducing dropouts

and encouraging “self-moti-
vation” rather than grade-
grubbing. .

Of the few schools which
have offered pass-fail long

enough to gauge its effects,

Princeton and Brown have
both found that it is moder-
ately successful in tempting
students to try new ﬁelds.

PRINCETON, WHICH be-
gan pass-fail last spring, is
extending the options to in-
clude auditing courses for
credit. Edward Sullivan, dean
of Princeton’s College re-
ported that almost three-
quarters of the undergrad-,
uates took advantage of the
pass-fail option when it was
first offered last spring, but
fewer than one-quarter did
so in this year’s fall semes-
ter.

A survey last spring at
Brown showed that courses
chosen covered a wide range
of ﬁelds, with no single de-
partment attracting more
than ten per cent of the to-
ta]. English was the most
popular ﬁeld, math and sci-
ence the least popular among
the 349 students who opted
for pass-fail courses. They
make up about one-eighth of
the approximately 2,450 un-
dergraduates_

In Friday’s edition of The Pitt News a mysterious group of Univers-

1 the “Fraternal Order of The Pontons.” It is unfortunate that these men

of the student body and the maturity displayed by those participating.
All in all the whole occurrence was a disgrace. To begin with anyone
who thinks a “panty raid” is “cool” or “in” is about as “out-to-lunch” as
one can be. Indeed “letting the silk fly” when out with the Big Apple and
Hoola Hoop, If we are interested in looking like we are a “with it” student
body then we should be picketing for the Vietnam War (pro or con—it
really doesn’t matter) or we should be storming the State Capitol and
booing -our newly elected governor. .
It is utter hogwash to try and pass off this massmeeting as some
sort of show of “school spirit,” To begin with nothing could be more dam-

aging to Alma Mater that to have students running wild, breaking windows

courses without grade or
credit requirements. The col-
leges participating in this
experiment are Allegheny,
Colorado, Lake Forest, Col-
by, Pomona, and Florida
Presbyterian, while Goddard
College in Vermont follows
the same pattern for all stu-
dents.

One of the more noted at-
tempts to encourage motiva-
tion is used at Reed College
in Oregon, where conven-
tional grades for all students
are recorded but students dc
not see their grades until
after graduation. Advisers
counsel a student when his
grades are slipping.

WHILE MOST educators
recognize that the usual
grading presents many prob-
lems, not all are sure that
the pass-fail system is the
perfect answer.

It is unlikely, for instance,
that graduate schools would
look kindly on transcripts
full of only P’s. At the Uni-
versity of Chicago. Jacob W.
Getzels, professor of educa
tion and psychology, com-
mented that graduate schools
can “simply not spend the
time necessary to read fold-
ers of comments on each stu-
dent.” This, he felt, would
be necessary to distinguish
the outstanding students

. from the mediocre if they

were given -“P’s.”

Why a Reading Period?

Education is oneof the

most treasured gems on the “

face of this often troubled
world. It is also one of the
most permanent gifts that
the past and present can im-

part to the future. Unfor-,‘

tunately, many areas of the
world are too pressed by the
daily struggle for survival
to reap the beneﬁts of a
structured education while
other areas are so blessed
with materialistic beneﬁts of-
life that education is. often
regarded as just another

‘commodity easily qualiﬁed

a.nd sold,-

IN THE United States,
higher education has opened
up its arms to more and
more people. The multiuni-.,
versity is a fairly recent
manifestation‘ of the current:
value placed on the learning
process. Too often, however,
emphasis among peers isn’t
placed on the learning pro-
cess. Too often, however,
emphasis among peers isn’t_
placed on the inherent value
of cultivating the mind, but
upon its interim value as a
means to some end.

Rapidity is highlighted at
the expense of absorption.
The give — and - take between
student and academicians is
ignored. Diplomas are ‘adver-
tised as keys to success ra-
ther than as symbols of
knowledge. .

IF THE opportunity for .

learning wasn't as broad as
it is, more ‘people might
treasure its values and re-
spect its implications: But
because of its permanent na-
ture in our society, the pro-
cess of learning is too often
taken for granted.

In the multiuniversity, it
is much easier to become
emotionally involved over is-
sues of academic freedom
rather than academic qual-
ity.‘ Not that many students

have picketed administrative
offices for installing tele-
vised lecture programs.
NOR WERE that many
people aroused when, as an
oversight, the reading. per-
iod was dropped from the

l 3

Winter trimester calendar. ’

- it seems that more students

were irritated over the fact
that the trimester was ex-
ended two days in order to
incorporate a brief reading
period,

It’s difficult to surmise
that those irritated were up-
set by the fact that they
now have two more days to
absorb and interpret what
they have imbibed during
the previous 15 weeks. If
they are, then it’s unfortun-
ate that they regard the ed-
ucation they are receiving as
a tedious process the shorter
the better. '

AT SOME universities
reading periods extend over
a two week period or more.
In ideal it offers the oppor-
tunity to cover remaining

assignments and reﬂect upon "

the naturevof the course in
toto.

Some students might ar- -

gue that a reading period‘

only beneﬁts‘ those C that have
done nothing during the
term. Well, two days won’t
help anyone who has done
nothing previously.

FOR FRESHMEN, adap-
tion to ﬁnals with no break
at all after the conclusion of
classes would be quite a dif-
ficult experience. For students
involved in any extracurricu-
lar activities, the beneﬁts of
a reading period hardly need
be stated.

A reading period is a ne-
cessity in the calendar. Its
assets are manifest. Those
that doubt its benefits must
also doubt the value of the
education they are receiving.

Editor Views Notions About Vietnam

by ALEX FRANK
Speaking before a packed
audience at Clapp Hall Fri-
day night, David Dellinger
editor of the pacifist publi-
cation Liberation, observed
that until recently we. “knew
none of the truth about North
Vietnam,” and now that we know
something, we think We kn0W
more than we actually do.”
On the basis of his recent
lengthy tour of China, North and

South Vietnam, and other South- ,

east Asian countries which in-
cluded interviews with peasant-
villagers, city-dwellers, students,
and numerous oﬁicials ranging
from commune leaders to Ho Chi
Minh, Mr. Dellinger discussed a
number of popular mistaken no-
tions that Americans have of
North Vietnam.

The inconsistencies of govern-
ment reports, contended Delling-
er, are enough to warrant sus-
picion of US activities and mo-
tives. On the one hand we have
been told that bombings of urban

are “mistakes due to wars.” Then
we were told in answer to criti-
cism for bombing downtown Ha-
noi that “under no circumstances
could they (American bombers)
bomb within ﬁve miles of Hanoi,

part of the city.

Dellinger reported witnessing
a number of villa.ges——many small
and remove-—bombed, _ napalmed,
and strafed by Americans. Since
the complete destruction of the
city of Fu Li by 250 heavy bombs
could hardly be explained as a
“mistake,” official sources term-
ed it a. military target because it
was situated on a strategic road.
If the road were indeed the
target, asked Dellinger, why were
bombs dropped on civilian homes.
It is small wonder, pointed out
Mr. Dellinger, that North Viet-
namese react to US declarations
of keeping Hanoi and Haiphong

ments “public relations gim-
micks.

American use of fragmentation
bombs was cited as another ex-
ample of the hypocrisy of mili-
tary policy-makers. Fragmenta-
tion’ bombs are six by eight feet
canisters which explode in the
air emitting 300 smaller bombs,
each containing 150 steel slivers.

_ “Ironically,” they are too small

to damage steel military .equip-
ment. But as Vietnamese doctors
reported to Dellinger, they are
deadly to human beings.

The official US response is that
they are “effective for anti-air-
craft men.” Yet Mr. Dellinger
pointed out that there is no way
for these bombs to distinguish
soldiers from men, women, and
children. The widespread range
of the bombs is another reason
to doubt official intentions.

Even more convincing, stated
Dellinger, was the strafing which

attended the bomb attacks. Amer-
ican ﬂyers are told. to “hit any-
thing that moves,” with the avow-
ed purpose of killing livestock.
Yet it is quite common that live-
stock are attended by villagers,
often by children, a fact that is
certainly well known to military
strategists.

In regard to American oﬁicial

_ and press reports of North Viet-

namese persecution of Catholics,
Mr. Dellinger provided the per-
sonally ,observed counter-exam-
ple of a small Catholic village,
“lightly” bombed, in which 40
homes were destroyed and 32
people killed.

The havoc wreaked throughout
Vietnam has created a hostility
which, Dellinger reports, is “com-
mon place” in Saigon; Anti-Com-
munist Buddhist leaders are even
more anti-American; moreover,
Dellinger suggested, these views

are typical of all the sections of,‘

Vietnam which he visited.

The so-called civil war that be-
gan the now international con-
ﬁict is passe, concluded Delling-

er. The war is now between Viet- ‘ ..

nam and the United States.

Four Conquer
Dorm League

by DAVE SHEAIL,

The “rough" struggle in the
two divisions of the dorm basket-
ball league ended last week with
Sutherland House winning the
“B” division and Stratford House
breaking the two week tie with
Keystone House.

The Stratford - Keystone game
was anything but well played,

marked by various ﬁghts between.

the officials and players. The
seven point spread between the
two teams can mainly be attri-
buted to the officiating rather

‘than the differences in abilities

of the two teams. Both teams
will participate in the champion-
ship.

Sutherland’s win (56-36)’ over
the Roaring Twenties leaves them
the only underfeated team in “B”
division. With balanced scoring
from Chuck Wise," Jerry Fair,
Sutherland"
completely dominated the game.

The game between Beacon

House and Panther House was
billed as a close game between
the second best teams in the di-
vision, but Panther House com-
pletely dominated the entire
men made double ﬁgures with
John Cassiani leading the scor-
ers with 20 points.

The Top‘ Colt is dwarfed by
the varsity‘ award, the Work-

ed by their counterparts. In a
school where most teams labor
in obscurity, the frosh have
caught what there is of student
spirit. _ ‘

Yet, even on this team, Mike
Patcher is unrecognized by the
fans. They know Charlie Hunt
because of his height, Paul Napo-

butes, so he goes relatively un-

frosh coach Tim Grgurich. And
varsity coach Bob Timmons.

“Mike can help us out a lot
next year,” said Timmons. “He
has good inside moves, he hits
the boards real well, and he can
shoot with either hand.” ‘

Patcher calls this last fact “a
blessing, but also a burden. At
the beginning of the year, I’d
get the ball and not know which
hand I was going to shoot with.

“But the coach has been work-
ing with me on developing a
set method of shooting, so now I
always know what I’m going to
do.” ‘

Another problem that Patcher
has had to overcome relates back
to his high school days in Johns-
town. At Bishop McCort High
School, Patcher played center.
But, at 6’4”, he has been a for-

wvard for the frosh. “It’s quite a

change. Facing the basket is an
entirely different game. It takes
more speed, better ballhandling,
and entirely new moves.”

Even at 6'4”, Patcher is small

 Still Out Phi Kaps Pace League I 

  ‘B’ as End Draws Near

Top,IMisfits
New Leaders

by JERRY GRUEBEL

As the Independent Intramural
Basketball League continued ac-
tion, the Misﬁts reached the top
of the standings.

In League “A,” the Misﬁts won
three games while the Young
Bulls (3-0) were idle. Beating
the 69ers, 57-42; the Giants, 80-
35; and the Follies, 49-40, the
Misﬁts brought their record to
5-0. The Misﬁts have been win-
ning easily with team balance.
Three or four players have scored
in the double ﬁgures each game.

In other League “A” competi-
tion, the Pansies (3-2) beat the
Giants (0-4), 63-40, and then lost
a close, 51-47, game to Fiol’s Fol-
lies (3-2).

Meanwhile, in the “B” League,
the; undefeated MBA (4-0) con-
tinued dominating play. Behind
Captain Bob Schu1tz’s 20 points,
the MA downed the Nads, 60-43.

The race for ﬁrst place in the
“B” League has also remained
close as DSC won twice. Now 4-1
overall, DSC beats the Smith's
Commuters, 65-36, and the Clan,
47-39.

‘ by ART ROSENGARTEN
As the interfiaternity basketball season in league “B”
reaches its final two games, a tight race has developed be-
tween Phi Kappa Theta, Sigma Kappa, and Sigma Alpha

Epsilon for the lead.

The Phi Kaps are currently
leading the league with a 4-0 rec'-
ord. They are a high scoring
team and use a strong zone de=

« fense that stiﬂes their opponent's

offense. Their scoring is usually
spread equally among the big in-
side men, Rich Erdelyi, Sam Pen-
nella, and Dave Stack, and Bill
Weber from the outside.

Tied for second place are Kap-
pa‘ Sigma and Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon. SAE, with a 4-1 record, is
led by a nucleus of Jim Snyder,
Dave Sherman, and Jeff Leech.
Their only loss has been to Phi
Kappa Theta by a 37-31 score.
They have only one game remain-
ing, but that is with Kappa Sig-
ma, and a win by either team
would have a vital eﬁect on the
league race.

Besides the game with SAE,

I Kappa Sigma has a game left

with the Phi Kaps. If they win
both of these games, they would
_be tied for the league lead, neces-
sitating a play-off for the cham-
pionship. Kappa Sigma is led by
Bill Greene and Mark Zovko.

Robert Byman, University of Illinois

Dear Mr. Byman:

There is an urgency in your last let-ter. You put it
simply:

”We want to get places, and get there fast.”
So does business. We are just as anxious to keep

able men moving fast as you are. At DuPont, where
someone is promoted every ten working minutes,

' experiments with electronic educationallprograms

cut training time and increase training quality. g
Programmed instruction techniques there shortened
a five-day sessionfor graduate engineers to one day.

2‘ ‘ And when 300 companies send recruiters to a

college where only 250 seniors are graduating, you
can be sure these recruiters aren't searching for
dawdlers.

U.S. Rubber has developed an ”early identification
program” to help it ”grow” its own executives. Each

tclivisional manager annually lists men of

management potential—as many as they wish below

T the age of 28, not more than 10 between 28 and 30,

5.between 30’ and 32, and 3 between 32 and 35.
Each of these men is ’’kept current’ and important
job openings are filled first from the group.

AT&T recruits a college graduate for executive
training, gives him a year of special tra_ining, then
offers him ajob that normally would go to someone
a great deal more experienced. If he handles it

well, he is on his way. It is reported that, though
half the recruits wash out or quit during the first five

 

Robert W. Galvin, Motorola Inc.

  

years, the chance for real responsibility definitely

raises trainee morale.

.Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation has
adoptedtwo policies in this respect—”acceleralted
experience” and ”job enlargement.” The first takes
menin their early thirties and gives them heavier-
than-normal responsibility, assignments like overseas
posts that force them to make their own decisions. _
The second policy adds new responsibilities by g
restudying and changing the organizational structure.
Both practices are aimed at moving men ahead as
fast as they can travel. '-

l.B.M. recently developed and marketed a new family
of computers aimed at obsoleting all other existing
computers including their own. Five of the ten men
reported at the heart of this undertaking ‘are still
under 40—and the project began five or six years ago!

R. H. Macy & Co. doesn't even wait for people to go
to college. They form a ”Prep Squad” of top high
schoolgraduates, put them in challenging non_-_
executive positions for two years. The men and
women who show promise then join college
graduates in an executive training program.
(Competitive scholarships for further study are open
to both groups.)

In fairness, a word of caution must drop in here. The
fastest track is not the right track for every runner.
When The Wall Street Iournal speaks of a 27-year-
old man bolting a $25,000-a-yearjob for one paying
$35,000, it doesn't always follow that this man is

the most successful man on his block. In the long run

(A Businessman’s Letter toa Student Who Wants Speed)

and in broad human terms, in fact, he may not be
very successful at all.

In my very first open letter in October, I stated my
conviction that business is not the right career for
every student. May I add to this now: fast-rising
business careers are not invariably the right careers
for every businessman. l

As I tried to point out throughout this letter,
however, the fast track is there—for the runners who
want it and who can qualify in the speed trials.

—Robert W. Galvin
Chairman, Motorola Inc.

BUSINESS AND YOU

This open letter about business is written
by a businessman to one of six student
correspondents on six different campuses.
It is the tenth in a continuing series being
published in 29 student newspapers across
the country.

Robert Byman is a student at University of
Illinois. Robert W. Galvin is chairman of
Motorolalnc. If you have comments or-
questions, write Mr. Galvin at 9401 ‘West
Grand Avenue, Franklin Park, Illinois 60131.
