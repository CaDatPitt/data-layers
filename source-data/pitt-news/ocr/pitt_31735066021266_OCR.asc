Research investigation changes hands

By Michele Quinn
The Pitt News

After months of scrutiny by a
congressional subcommittee, the
National Institute of Health has
transferred the responsibility of
investigating scientific miscon-
duct further up in the agency's hi-
erarchy to the Office of the
Director.

The NIH, a governmental agen-
cy which oversees approximate-
ly 50,000 grants totaling $7
billion each year, has recently
been under the scrutiny of the
U.S. Congress’ Human Resources

and Intergovernmental Relations
Subcommittee in regard to al-
leged conflict of interest cases, in-
cluding one at the University of
Pittsburgh.

The duties of investigating
these cases have been transferred
from the Division of Management
Survey and Review to the New
Office of Center Integrity, which
is under the NIH director's super-
vision.

”The movement of that office
has shown the importance of in-
vestigating scientific miscon-
duct,” said Janet Nuberg, an NIH
source.

The NIH has been criticized by
Rep. Ted Weiss, D—N.Y., the
chairman of the subcommittee,
for not providing stringent
review, guidelines and proper
and neutral investigative depart-
ments in scientific misconduct
and conflict of interest cases.

The Pitt case involves research

performed by the Otitis Media"

Research Center at Children's
Hospital, in which funds were
received from NIH as well as
pharmaceutical companies such
as Eli Lilly & Co. and Ross
Laboratories.

Dr. Erdem I..Cantekin, a Pitt

tions, claims that the funds from
the pharmaceutical companies
may have influenced the out-
come of the research. Cantekin
dissented with the study, which
stated that amoxicillin is effective
in the treatment of middle-ear in-
fections. -

Students assault Towers cafeteria worker

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Four female Pitt students have
been banished from the Litchfield
, Towers cafeteria pending further
investigation of an assault on a
cafeteria worker that occurred in
the cafeteria last Saturday.
”They can still eat at Lothrop
Hall. We just don't want any
more trouble before the Judicial
Board hearing,” said Mary H.
Cacali, associate director of

_ Housing and Food Services._~_ 

  

Cacali said that the organiza-
tion considered taking away the
students’ meal plans altogether,
but decided to wait because
”there are two conflicting stories.

”_ Right now, we're just gather-
ing statements from the people
involved, including the four
girls,” she added. ”We will then
turn the statements over to the Ju-
dicial Boar .” _ _ ._ _ .

”We’ve also discussed this
withthe assistant ‘manager of the
cafeteria,” she said. ”He claims
to have witnessed the entire in-
cident, and will probably testify
at the'hearing. However, the girls
deny that he was there. ‘
”Again, the stories are totally
contradictory. The cafeteria wor-

evidence that one of the students
involved was verbally abusive to

Student loan director says indictment is baseless

HARRISBURG (AP) -- The ex-
ecutive director of the state's
student—loan agency, indicted last
week for his alleged role in a

contract-kickback scheme, said.

yesterday the charges against him
are ”baseless.”

’’I do expect to be exonerated
andwill have more to say on this
entire matter once charges have
been filed,” Kenneth R. Reeher
said in a statement issued by the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency.

The statement was Reeher’s
first public comment since he and
a former top deputy at the agen-
cy were indicted by a federal
grand jury last Friday. It came one
day after the PHEAA board vot-
ed to give Reeher an unpaid
leave of absence until the case is
settled.

Reeher, 66, said in his two-
page statement that the leave
”will allow me to work full-time
on a defense against these base-
less charges.”

Reeher and former PHEAA
deputy Harry P. Casoni, 55, were
each charged with one count of

three counts of interstate travel in
aid of racketeering and one count
of conspiracy. The indictment al-
leges the two men sought kick—
backs in return for awarding a
nearly $1.8 million no-bid con-
tract to an Illinois firm, Gabler
Educational Management Serv-
ices Inc.

Guilty pleas entered
in fraud conspiracy

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —— The
top defendant in a money laun-
dering case that includes the Yu-
goslav consul general in Chicago
pleaded guilty yesterday to less-
er charges of conspiracy and fail-
ing to report cash transactions.

Hubert Francis Cole, 44, of
Carrollton, Texas, pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to defraud the Unit-
ed States, failure to file currency
reports and violating arms expc_)_rt_
regulations.

Cole, a self-described financial
consultant from Texas, also
pleaded guilty to attempting to
launder $2 million in cash he was

waiting to pick up at Philadelphia
International Airport when he
was arrested Dec. 1.

Discrimination suit
settled out-of-court

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ Volkswa-
gen of America Inc. and the Unit-
ed Autoworkers agreed to settle
a racial discrimination suit against
them for‘$718,000 without ad-
mitting any of the allegations filed
on behalf of about 800 former
employees.

NEWS BRIEFS

U.S. Districtjudge Gustave Di-
amond, who is presiding over the
6-year-old case, scheduled a June
13 hearing to consider approving
the out-of-court settlement.

Under terms settled March 24,
the American subsidiary of the
German auto company would
pay $670,000, and the union
would pay $48,000, said Tom
McDonald, VW spokesman in

The defendants settled to avoid
the costs of further litigation. '

Volkswagen also agreed to pay
$250,000 in lawyers fees.

Volkswagen closed its lone
U .S. assembly plant last year, cit-
ing declining sales of its Golf and
Jetta models.

What do Pitt professors,

do with their summers?

By Jim Tezak
Staff Writer

Ever wonder what professors
do after finals are graded and
most students go home for the
summer?

Dr. Richard Drisko of Pitt's
physics department is planning to
spend his summer here at the
university, teaching a physics
course and continuing research
he is currently conducting.

That doesn't sound too excit-
ing, but at least he's talking. Some
professors are reluctant to talk
about their summer plans.

One professor was helpful and
friendly until asked about what

she planned to do over the sum-

mer. Then, she suddenly remem-
bered that she was late for an
important appointment and that
her office hours were booked
solid for the rest of the week.

Another professor simply‘ re-
fused to comment and then hur-
ried away.

According to Drisko, some
teachers at Pitt may be reluctant
to reveal what they do over the
summer because they are on the

university payroll only nine.

months a year. Unless they get a
special appointment from .the
university, they are not employed
at Pitt over the summer.

  

’’It might be embarrassing for
them to say they're loading box-
es in a warehouse because they
didn't get university employ-
merit,” Drisko said.

Jim White, who teaches an in-
troductory journalism course at
Pitt during the fall and winter

semesters, doesn't have to worry ‘

about summer employment. He's
the night news editor at The Pitts-
burgh Press. Because he works at

the paper year-round, White con-

siders teaching a supplementary
job.

Dr. Peter Siska, of Pitt's chemis-
try department, said that he
doesn't know of any chemistry
faculty who have trouble getting
summer employment at the
university. All of the chemistry
staff are either teaching or in-
volved in research projects here
at Pitt.

Siska’s plans for the summer in-'
clude doing research, attending a
scientific conference in July,
preparing some curriculum
changes for his freshman honors
chemistry course and continuing ,
to work on a textbook he is
writing.

”Basically, during the summer,
I work as long and as hard as I do,
during the year, Just on different
things,” Siska said.

been published was the one in-
volving amoxicillin, which was
completed in 1984.

Cantekin claims that these
studies are completed and ready
for publication.

But Dr. Charles Bluestone, the
principal investigator of the
amoxicillin study and the head of
the Otitis Media Center, said that

. these studies are still in progress

and will be submitted for publi-
cation when the research is com-
pleted. V

”We conduct a careful analy-
sis of the data which can last up
to a year. Then there is up to six
months for an internal review,”
Bluestone said.

However, -Cantekin pointed
out that according to congres-
sional records, Bluestone sent a
letter to the NIH in 1987 in
which he said that the ”final anal-
ysis and preparation of a
manuscript suitable for publica-
tion is currently in its final
stages.” Cantekin also said that
Bluestone told Congress that the
research results would be submit-
ted for publication in a Decem-

I ber 1988 journal, but it was never

submitted.

”The pharmaceutical industry
funneled more than $1.6 million
into the center while the center
was performing NIH-funded
research which could have a
large impact on the industry,”
Cantekin said. He added that it
would be in the best interest of
university researchers to find cer-
tain antibiotics effective if they

wanted to receive future phar-I

maceutical funding.

Cantekin is now being inves-
tigated by a Pitt panel regarding
charges of academic misconduct
concerning this study. Cantekin

feels that these charges have been .

“trumped up”-because he acted
as a ”whistle blower” and in-

_1.

formed the congressional sub-
committee about the alleged
conflict of interest. _
After hearing Cantekin’s tes-
timony, Weiss said during a Sep-
tember subcommittee hearing, ”It
seems to me that NIH really can't

fall back on waiting until the g

university has already completed
[the study], whitewashed it,
closed it and is now trying to get
the guy who blew the whistle.”

Cantekin also feels that the NIH
should provide stricter surveil-
lance of research grantees and
should assure that the results be
published for public knowledge.

”When the NIH funds research
into the effectiveness of an extist-

ing product, such as amoxicillin,_

it obviously launches a project
which may cause financial loss to
a manufacturer,” Cantekin said.
”The NIH should establish proce-
dures which could have a finan-
cial impact on existing markets
and then apply and enforce stan-
dards to prevent those with finan-
cial interest in the outcome of the
research from having relation-
ships with the researchers.
”The NIH must insist delivery
of the product.  It makes no
sense to spend millions of dollars
to finance, a study with taxpayers’
money and then to permit the
grantee institution to sit on the
data, to delay publication or ob-
struct publication ofanalysis of
the data, and claim property
rights ‘in the data against the
whole world,” Cantekin said.

Cantekin urged the NIH to use i I

a percentage of its budget to set
up a separate institute to set stan-
dards on appropriate conduct
and use of federal grants. The
process should involve neutral
third parties to investigate possi-

—‘ ble misuse of funds or conflict of

interest, he said.

which is also investigating the
research discrepancy.

The hearing board was sup-
posed to release its decision
last week, but as of Tuesday
Cantekin had not heard
anything.

”Obviously, it is in their in-
terest not to finish it because
there is nothing there to find
me guilty,” Cantekin said.

Cantekin pointed out that he
has already been exonerated
by the Senate Tenure and Aca-
demic Freedom Committee.
He said that in a letter to him
in May, 1988 the TAFC stated,
”This sort of administrative
reaction to the complaint of a
faculty member has a chilling

effect on open communica-

tions and is regrettable.”

According to Cantekin, he is
not allowed to teach classes or
conduct research until the
hearing board releases its de-
cision.

because they have denied it to
me for a year,” Cantekin said.
"I would like this to be
resolved.”

Cantekin said that adminis-,
trators have told him the hear-
ing board’s report should be
available ”any day now.”

During the September congres-
sional subcommittee hearing,
NIH Director James Wyngaarden
told the committee his agency
had already taken several steps to
strengthen the agency's respon-
siveness to allegations of possible
misconduct, including the hiring
of additional staff, improving
computer files and increasing
education efforts. -

According to an article pub-
lished in December’s New York
_Newsday, after the September
hearing, Weiss said, ”Congress
will not sit back and allow the ap-
pearance of misconduct or actu-
al misconduct to go on  the

NIH should do a better job.‘

Otherwise, Congress or some
other entity will be created to do
it.'And Congress will not wait
forever.”

Soviets save money, abandon space station temporarily 

By ‘Andrew Katell

Associated Press Writer

MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviets
decided to bring home the cos-
monauts from their space station
next week and leave it temporar-
ily vacant to save money, but a
new crew will be launched in
August, the deputy flight director
said yesterday.

Viktor D. Blagov said no tech-
nical problems had cropped ‘up
in the Mir, the 3-year-old orbiting
complex that is the showcase of
the Soviet space program. He
said plans to keep Soviets aboard
the station continuously were
abandoned for several reasons.

”By this action, we. are of
course economizing some sum
which can be used for other pur-
poses,” said Blagov, speaking in

a telephone interview from the
Mission Control Center in
Kaliningrad, north of Moscow.

He did not identify the areas to
which money would be diverted
or say how much would be
saved, but the public has called
for the untold millions of rubles
spent on space to be targeted to
end chronic shortages of con-
sumer goods and food.

Blagov also said Soviet scien-
tists were swamped analyzing in-
formation gathered from Mir —
the Russian word for ”peace” —
since its launch Feb. 20, 1986.
They now must pause to review
”what we have accomplished
and decide what's next.”

Tentative plans call for a mod-
ule the same size as Mir to be at-
tached to the station at year's
end, and until then there is no

need for a crew, he said. Wed-
nesday's scheduled launch of a
replacement crew has been
canceled.

Cosmonauts Alexander
Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and
Valery Polyakov are to mothball
the Mir and return to Earth on
April 27. A new crew will be sent
up in mid—August to prepare for
the attaching the module, Blagov
said. The attachment contains a
space bicycle for cosmonauts, a
solar battery to supplement that
of the Mir station itself, an East
German optical experiment and
an airlock through which cos-
molnauts can pass to take
spacewalks. .

One module, a space laborato-
ry dubbed Kvant, was attached to

Mir in April 1987. Three others '

are planned, including one to be

i‘ THE PITT NEWS, Wednesdoy, April 19, 1939

put up at the end of this year or
early next year in which crystals
will be grown for semiconduc-_
tors, electronic parts used in com-
puters and other devices, Blagov

_ said. The module will produce

the crystals on an industrial scale,
and they will then be sold.

Another reason for putting Mir ,

on automatic mode is to give a
rest to its support staff at mission
control and tracking stations that
have been working continuous-
ly for, three years.

”People are tired. They haven't
had vacations. We owe them
this,” he said.‘

Officials have said a ground
controller sent an erroneous com-
mand to an unmanned Mars
probe, Phobos l, in September,
leaving it useless. A sister ship,
Phobos II, was lost for still un-

determined reasons last month.
Blagov said Mir uses different
controllers than those who
worked on Phobos, but indicat-
ed all are susceptibleto fatigue.
”Tiredness can lead to an in-
crease in mistakes, and a break
gives a positive "effect to a per-
son's work,” Blagov said.
During the three-month break,
he said, scientists will continue to
gather data from automatic Mir
instruments studying a superno-
va, photographing the ocean
shelf and monitoring meteorites.

Engineers are boosting the Mir
to a higher orbit to keep its orbit
from decaying, Blagov said.

In 1974, the vacant American
Skylab 4 space station fell into the
Earth's atmosphere and disin-
tegrated upon re-entry.

Wright opens defense
against ethics charges

By Jim Drinkard
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) — House
Speaker Jim Wright, opening his
defense against a string of ethics
committee charges, sought Tues-
day to rally Democratic col-
leagues and told them, ’’I intend
to fight and I intend to win.”

He said that while he may have
made mistakes in judgment, ’’I
have never done anything to dis-
honor this institution and I never
will.”

In a half—hour speech to a pri-
vate session of the Democratic
Caucus in the House chamber,
and later in press releases, Wright
chose to concentrate his defense
on one issue: the charge that his
wife, Betty, did no substantial

received from a Fort Worth friend
from 1980 to 1984.

But more troubling to manyof
his colleagues were charges that
Wright sought to evade House
limits on outside earned income
through seven bulk sales of his
book, ’’Reflections of a Public
Man,” most of them made in lieu
of accepting speaking fees from
interest groups.

Wright was gathering affidavits
from people in Fort Worth who
said they had worked ‘with his

" wife and observed what she did

in return for her $18,000-a—year
salary from real estate developer
George Mallick and the partner-
ship the two couples formed,
known as Mallightco.

He said she had researched in-

     
   

vestment opportunities in real es-
tate and office building ventures
in Fort Worth and New York and
studied investments in a winery,
in the movie version of the musi-

cal ”Annie,” and in oil ventures’

and stock purchases. '

Abortion

Continued from page 3

”We don't advocate one
method over another," she said.

There is a flat fee for abortions,
which are not covered by public
assistance.

A woman who chooses to have
an abortion will then be en-

couraged by a nurse practioner to

abstain from sex if she is a
teenager, or will be given a type
of birth control.

According to Hun/vitz, Planned
Parenthood’s medical attention
goes beyond patient care.
Throughout the year, there are
workshops dealing with parent-
ing a child, single parenting,
adoption, self esteem, human
sexuality, growth and develop-

ment and decision-making skills.

”These are classes in life skills,
and we feel they are very benefi-
cial to people when making de-
cisions in a person's life,” said
Dana Jornsay, director of educa-
tion at PPP.

”We help them to develop the
skills to make important decisions
when it comes to life, and we
also help them to realize they
have to be able to be responsible
for the decisions they make,” said
Jornsay.

PPP also refers people with low
incomes to public assistance for
medical, day-care and counseling
services.

”Harness the power of the
sun, cheaply and cleanly;
fusion in a bottle with
this new device.
Just add heavy water
and plug it in!"

If a salesman came to your
door and made this claim, you
would probably be skeptical. But
just a few weeks ago, several
reputable scientists made exact-
ly this claim.

Stanley Pons and Martin
Fleischmann made this an-
nouncement at a press confer-
ence that they called in Utah on
March 23. Since then, various
claims have been made that seem
to confirm their report: thermo-
nuclear fusion at room tem-
perature. 

Setting aside the fact that for the
last 40 years scientists have only
been able to achieve this feat at
temperatures of 100 million
degrees Celsius, and setting aside
the fact that a new ”break-
through” in fusion has been just
over the horizon for those same
40 years, there are serious rea-
sons to remain skeptical about
this claim of fusion in a bottle.

At the time of the original press
conference, none of the research-

ers’ claims were supported by a
published, reviewed, scientific
papen

Preliminary, unreviewed co-
pies of Pons and Fleischmann's
report were available via com-
puter networks a month before
publication, but the team refused
to release a copy to reporters. In
fact, some physicists have gone
out of their way to avoid report-
ers. For example, Fleischmann
gave a seminar at CERN, the Eu-
ropean Laboratory for Particle
Physics, in early April, in which
he released his experimental
data. He gave a talk only after all
the reporters had been removed.

Second, the research team
claimed during the March 23
press conference that the original
paper would appear in scientific
literature in May. But.Pons later
told Science News that the semi-
nal paper had been submittedto
the lournal of Electroanalytical
Chemistry, and that no publica-
tion date had been set. The report
appears in this month's issue of

that journal.

If that does not arouse suspi-
cion, then consider the actual ex-
perimental claims that the
researchers are making. At best,
the data -is conflicting and theo-
retically questionable.

In a nuclear reaction, the nuclei
of two atoms come together to
form a new atom. But.because
the two nuclei repel one another
(in a manner similar to the north
poles of two magnets) it takes a
great deal of energy to fuse them.
As of this date, the only con-
firmed place that this reaction
takes place spontaneously is in a

a star, like our sun.

‘ But supposing that scientists do
get hydrogen nuclei to fuse, there
would be telltale evidence of that
union. First of all, . researchers
could detect the end products.
Second, particles called neutrons
would be given off.

Pons and Fleischmann claim
that they measured a great deal
of heat from the reaction. Texas
A&M confirmed: this. But they did
not measure for neutrons direct-
.ly. _By not doing so, other sources
of neutrons cannot be ruled out
(for example, cosmic rays).
Moreover, the scientistscounted
10 billion times fewer neutrons

Wednesday, April 19, I989

Cold nuclear fusion could just be another scientific myth

than they should have for the
amount of heat involved.
Another lab at Brigham Young
University confirmed the
presence of neutrons but did not
get the same amount of heat as
Pons and Fleischmann. Georgia
Tech backed out of its confirma-
tion because heat produced by
the reaction interfered with the
instrument used to count
neutrons.
Admittedly, it is early, but not
a single lab has unequivocally
confirmed that this phenomenon
is cold fusion. The assertion that
fusion was actually observed is
based solely on the fact that a net
production of heat was meas-
ured. According to a scientist at
‘Lawrence Livermore Laborato-
ries, the actual amounts of ener-
gy involved are so small that even
a slight error in measurement
could throw off the whole claim.
Laboratories have either con-
clusively observed neutrons or
heat — but not both. When scien-
tists observe the correct amount
of neutrons, and accurately meas-
ure net heat production, then this
phenomenon can be called cold
fusion.
Some scientists claim that Pons
and Fleischmann's results are the

product of a new type of fusion
reaction, in which no neutrons
are released. But scientists have
never seen this reaction in 40
years of experience with ' H-
bombs, atom smashers, and high-
temperature fusion.

Fleischmann and Pons could
go down in history as having
ushered in a new atomic age.
They could also go down in his-
tory with decades of other scien-
tists who have become excited
over mere laboratory curiosities.
Regardless, they have breached
scientific ethics by releasing infor-
mation before publication of their
experiment. Without publication,
the public can only trust their
word.

But in the meantime, if you are

approached by someone selling.

this new device, no matter how
scientifically supported his claims
are, don't buy it. Not yet.

The story of Fang: a Chinese astrophysicist dissident

BEIJING —— Until he was de-
nied entry to the dinner host-
ed by President George Bush
here in February, dissident
Fang Lizhi was a small thorn
in the Chinese government's
flesh. Now, thanks to some
old fashioned rough stuff more
characteristic of Mao's reign
than the regime of reform-
minded Deng Xiaoping,
Chinese police have made
Fang, an astrophysicist and
university professor, an inter-
national celebrity.

The elevator operator in
Fang’s humble apartment
building, which is located 30
minutes from the center of
town, has become ac-
customed to foreign visitors.
The operator instinctively
presses his floor number and,
without being asked, points a
visitor in the direction of

Has The Pitt News been guilty of encouraging sexism?

I found the piece by Mark Staf,
titled ”Toilet Seat Caprices,”
[April 13] to be a misogynist,
sophomoric, immature and ill-
conceived attempt at humor.

' Whyis it that The Pitt News con-

sistently uses women as the brunt
of its derisive ”humor”? I can
recall finding this type of infan-
tile ”humor” in grammar school,
but to see it in printywithin a
major university newspaper is a
disgrace and an embarrassment.

I'm sure the paper and its
writers are well aware of the
university's position on discrimi-
nation against any group of peo-
ple. As a result, I have never seen
an article in The Pitt News that
pokes ”fun” at any ethnic or re-
ligious groups. Unfortunately,

Fang’s apartment. At the press
of a finger, his doorbell plays
”Happy Birthday.” And not
only is Fang’s sense of humor
well—deve|oped, but his ego is
as well: A painting of Albert
Einstein faces a painting of
Fang on the opposite wall.
Fang told" me that the worst
course for the United States
would be to buckle under to
the Chinese government de-
mands that human rights be
treated as an internal matter.
He thinks the Bush administra-
tion should guard against ap-
plying a double standard
when dealing with the com-
munist world. He has seen
that pressure on the Soviets
has brought improvements in ,
human rights there, and he be-
lieves similar pressure, partic-
ularly linked to economic
incentives, will also bring a
.'relaxation of the totalitarian
arm in China.
Fang is among the growing
number of intellectuals in Chi-

to women, as evidenced by a

continuous barrage of articles that .

display contempt for women. I
believe itis time that the univer-
sity enforce its ban on discrimi-
nation and hold The Pitt News

accountable for its contents.

And then the rain came.

Right before the eighth inning
started, in fact. It was even rain-
ing in their dugout, but the Pitt
baseball team decided to play on
(sort of like the Seattle Mariners
would do if they didn't play in a
dome), only to succumb to Gene-
va College 10-5 in action at Trees
Field yesterday.

’’I am not very happy with our
performance,” Pitt Coach Larry
Wayman said. ”We had guys in

scoring position and couldn't get
the hits again. l don't think we
were ready to play [yesterday].
Geneva is not the same quality of
team that we face in the Big East
and it is tough getting up for
them. We weren't mentally pre-
pared to play today. I'm kind of
upset about that.”

It started out badly for the Pan-
thers in the very first inning.
Sophomore Tim Gralewski took
the mound for Pitt and Geneva
proceeded to knock him all over
the park.

They scored five runs before
the innin was over and for all

  

intents and purposes the game
was done, too.

”Timmy got the ball up and
they came out hot,” Wayman
said. ”lt’s just one of those things.
We got down early and all our
motivation was killed. By the
time the team settled down, we
had too much ground to make
up. Everytime we would score a
run, they would come right back.
It wasn't a very good day.”

Pens build confidencewit

By Alan ‘Robinson

AP Sports Writer A

The Pittsburgh Penguins aren't
supposed to win when all-
universe center Mario Lemieux
manages only two shots on goal.

The Penguins aren't supposed
to win when they play a crucial
game against the Philadelphia
Flyers, the cross—state team that
has dominated them for more
than a decade.

The Penguins aren't supposed
to win when the Flyers, the
NHL’s most accurate team on the

‘ power play, takes a 3-1 lead by
scoring three special teams goals.

So how did the Penguins, a
team totally lacking in postseason
tradition, beat the playoff-tested
Flyers 4-3 Monday night in the
first game of the Patrick Division
finals?

Was it Mario? Was it momen-
tum? Was it magic?

Five-run first inning keys Geneva over Pitt  

earned runs on five hits and two
walks. He is currently third on the
team with a 6.33 ERA.

Geneva pushed their lead up to
6-0 in the third before Pitt could
get going.

’’I don't want to make excuses,
because there is no way we
should have come out so flat to-
day,” Wayman said. ”The guys
are worried about finals coming
up and we do have a lot of inju-
ries, but that still shouldn't have
mattered.” »

The Panthers scored single runs
in the fourth and fifth innings, but
Geneva countered in.the sixth to

jump up 7-2. If Pitt could muster H
any spirit up, it would have been
dashed in the seventh."

on and it was followed by a

   Cowboys begin new era

as Tex Schramm resigns

By Dave Goldberg
AP Football Writer

NEW ‘YORK ——- An era came to

an end today when NFL owners

unanimously approved the sale
of the Dallas Cowboys to Arkan-
sas oilman Jerry Jones, and Tex
Schramm, the only president the
team ever had, resigned to head
the new International Football
League.

The vote, at a special meeting,
was followed by the announce-
ment that Schramm would head
the new league, which hopes to
start play as early as next spring.
Schramm had headed the Cow-
boys since their start 29 years ago
as an expansion team.

Schramm has been left out of all

the team's major decisions.

For example, Jones, without
Schramm’s approval, fired Tom
Landry as coach and replaced
him with Miami Coach Jimmy
Johnson. v

' ' ’’It’s just not my style to sit

around and take orders,”
Schramm said earlier. ”|t’s

difficult for me because I've been '

running an organization for 29
years.”

Because the sale involved the
purchase of Texas Stadium and
the Cowboys’ vast complex at
Valley Ranch, the NFL withheld
approval until all financial
aspects of the deal could be

Netters meet established goals

Pitt's men's and women's
tennis teams are coming- off
what head coach George

_on the "court and in the

The women's team finished
with a 7-6 record and finished
ninth in the Big East, while the
men's team finished sixth in
the league with a record of

11-11 that included an eight- '

match winning streak.

next year, despite the sched-
ules being more difficult. If we
work hard, we can develop
our talent." .

One area that both teams
are talented in is academics.

”Everybody did well aca-
demically and everybody
achieved good QPAs,” said
Dieffenbach. ”And_ with only
one senior graduating, every-

one is progressing to their '

degrees.

’’I think tennis positively in-
fluences the players’ academ-
ic performance.”

Of the performances on the
court, Dieffenbach said,
”Everybody showed good
team work and improved their

ability to compete on the ten-

nis court.”

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

Probably the I most mentally
and physically demanding posi-
tion on a baseball team is that of
the catcher.

The catcher is involved in ev-
ery play. He squats and stands up
over a hundred times a game. If
the catcher is good enough, he
even tells the pitcher what kind
of pitch to throw by means of
signals.

The Pitt baseball team has one
of the best catchers in the Big East
— Jon Weaver. Weaver, a senior,
has started every game for Pitt this
season, a rare and physically
difficult task for catchers.

Weaver is one of four Panthers
batting over .300 so far this year.
He is batting .310, and his 10 RBI
and seven doubles lead the team.

”Right now I'm swinging the
bat pretty well,” said Weaver. ’’I
started out slow, but lately I seem
to be coming around. I'm pretty
happy with the way I've been

to right field for RBI in Pi%:t"s loss
to Geneva College yesterday.
The loss dropped Pitt to 5-18
for the year. Pitt's main pI‘<')i)lem
this year has been pitching. The
pitching staff is young and inex-
perienced and has a combined
ERA of approximately 9.0. The
extra amount of pitches thrown

puts a lot of strain on Weaver '

throughout the game.

’’It does get frustrating, but you
have to look at it from the side
that they're learning and eventu-
ally they'll do all right,” said
Weaver. ”|t's just a shame that
we have a team full of seniors
and a lot of guys who can play
ball, and our pitching [is] having
problems.” ‘

Weaver is also a good defen-
sivecatcher and has a very strong
arm. He has just three errors in

23 games for a fielding percen-A ’ 

tage of .974.

’’I’m pretty strong defensively.
I just try to stay consistent and do
the things behind the plate that I
can do,” said Weaver. '

Grossman, Ricke tts rate
on Dr. D's draft chart

Quickly, before the year runs
out on us, The Pitt Newspresents
Dr. D's last word on pro football
till next fall with a projection of
the upcoming National Football
League draft.

Don't take my word for it, but...

1. Dallas Cowboys — Weak-
nesses: offensive line, defensive

line, linebacker. Selection: Troy

Aikman, QB, UCLA. Considered
the draft’s most important
prospect strictly due to position.
.If the Cowboys are going to build

from the bottom up, quarterback ,

is the place to start. Good size at
6-foot-2, 218 pounds.

THOMAS
DANYLUK

2. Green Bay Packers — Weak- .

nesses: quarterback, linebacker,
offensive line. Selection: Tony
Mandarich, OT, Michigan State.
Regarded as a true can't-miss
prospect. His 4.64 in the 40 is ex-

tremely impressive for his size’

(6-5,305 pounds). But to make
head coach Lindy lnfante’s com-
plex offense really work, Aikman
is who the Pack really need. QBs
Timm Rosenbach of Washington
State or Steve Walshof Miami in
the supplemental would also
help.

3. Detroit Lions —— Weakness-
es: wide receiver, defensive line.
Selection: Barry Sanders, RB, Ok-
lahoma "State. Garry James. was
the Lions’. leading rusher with
552 yards (3.0 per carry), and that

isn't gonna cut it with Chicago
and Minnesota thriving in the
NFC Central division. Sanders
will give Detroit a dimension it
hasn't had since the heyday of
Billy Sims.

4. Kansas City Chiefs — Weak-
nesses: quarterback, offensive
line, linebacker. Selection: Der-
rick Thomas, LB, Alabama. The
three-year starter for the Tide may
be even better than Cornelius

Bennett, and look what Bennett -

has done for the Buffalo Bills
defense. Would be a solid start-
ing point for head coach Marty
Schottenheimer's first season
with the team. Here, too, Rosen-
bach or ‘Walsh would come_ in
handy. '

5. Atlanta Falcons — Weak-
nesses: secondary, defensive line.
Selection: Deion Sanders, CB,
Florida State. Best athlete in the
draft; he ran a 4.27 40 in his first
combine workout. Atlanta has
made a firm commitment to

, rebuilding its defense.

6. Tampa Bay Buccaneers —
Weaknesses: defensive line, line-
backer, running back, offensive
line, secondary. Selection: Burt
Grossman, DE, Pittsburgh. Bucs
defense is pitiful. Grossman is

regarded by most scouts as the .
best defensive lineman ‘in the ~

draft, although his leg strength is
questionable. The Green Bay
Packer Report called him ”a
spoiled rich ki_d.’’ "’ .

7'. Pittsburgh Steelers — Weak-

nesses: defensive line, wide_

O'Leary’s versatility an weaVer__
extra asset for Panthers  

By Kent Hulnick

For The Pitt News

TJ. O’Leary, Pitt senior third-
baseman, was listed as one of the
top returning batters for the Pan-
thers in the preseason Big East
prospectus.

O’Leary hit for a .324 clip last
season (22 for 68 in 17 games).

But no one ever said anything
about O'Leary’s defense.

O’Leary, 6—foot-1, 185 pounds,
has played all four infield posi-
tions so far this year, and even
contributed a few innings of
pitching last season for Pitt base-
ball coach Bobby Lewis.

”[O’Leary's] versatility is im-
measurable,” Lewis said. ’’If we
need to move someone, to fill in,
it's usually T.J. that we move.
And we can move him anywhere
and_he’ll do a good job. He likes

. to play all the infield positions.”

As the prospectus says,
however, O’Leary is one of Pitt's
best hitters, something Lewis is
quick to_ point out. _

. ”He’s a solid hitter who doesn't

strike out a lot. When he swings,
he usually makes contact and
gets on base,” Lewis said.
O’Leary had one of his best
outings of the season last Thurs-
day in a victory over Youngstown
State. He went three for four, with
two singles and a double off the
fence in left field.
Considering some of the

problems a northeast school like I

Pittsburgh has recruiting baseball
players — who would rather play
a longer season in the warmth of
the southern or western United
States —— a player with O'Leary’s
versatility is definitely an asset to
the squad.

”He’s a hard worker, very
cooperative, easy to coach, a
major asset, and a source of
leadership,” Lewis said.

However, O’Leary, who some-
day would like to getinto coach-
ing, said, ’’I don't think of myself
as a leader.” '

As for the rest of this season,
O’Leary said, ’’Hopefully, we can
turn it around, and I'd like to just
keep hitting.”

plate, his mind is on more than
just catching the ball and throw- '
ing it when he has to. He calls the.
pitches, and according to Steve
Hoffmann, senior pitcher for Pitt,
he is one of the best at doing it.

”He’s a very intelligent catch-
er,” said Hoffmann. ”He knows
the batters well, and you can put
you"r trust in his calls. By’ letting
him call the game you -don't have
to think, you can just sit back and
throw.”

Hoffmannalso appreciates the
fact that Weaver is always pre-

pared to help everyone on the A

team.

”He’s always mentally in the
game. He picks up on the other
teams’ signs and he's vocal,
which keeps your concentration
on thegame. He does that better

than anybody who has ever if

caught for me,” said Hoffmann.

’’I want to win some- games.. r
We have some guys who are_ ‘
starting to hit the ball, and I'd like 1’
to keep swinging the bat good, so_ i

I think we could do all right down

Thomas, LB, Nebraska. Thomas
has ballooned to 267 pounds
since the end of the Cornhuskers
season, but Thomas is too good
a prospect to pass up. With the
disappointment in bad-news LB
Chip Banks, this makes Thomas
even more attractive.

9. Miami Dolphins — Weak-
nesses: defensive Iine, running
back, secondary. Selection: Louis
Oliver, 5, Florida. Dolphins ha-
ven't taken a defensive back in
the first round since 1980 (Don
McNeal). In four of the past five
drafts, Miami's top pick was
either a defensive lineman or

‘linebacker. Now the defensive

backfield is crying for help.
Oliver is a David Fulcher-sized
safety with Darrell Green's speed.

10. Phoenix Cardinals
Weaknesses: defensive line,
secondary, linebacker. Selection:
Donnell Woolford, CB, Clemson.
With the way the Cards draft, the
chances of this pick succeeding
in the NFL are highly unlikely.
Woolford was a four—year starter
at Clemson who excels at man-
to-man coverage. Cardinals need
to replace Leonard Smith, who
was traded to Buffalo last season.

11. Chicago Bears (from LA..

. Raiders) — Weaknesses: line-

- .33‘-.4

backer, secondary. Selection:
Steve Atvvater, 5, Arkansas. Bears’
defense has nearly fallen apart.

 Atwater, who will pair with All-
” Pro Dave Duerson, will provide

a quick shot of punishing energy.

12. Chicago Bears (from
Washington) — Weaknesses:
linebacker, offensive line. Selec-
tion: Eric Hill, LB, Louisiana State.

J Hill is 6-1, 250 pounds and plays

outside linebacker. That says
something about his range and
quickness. Chicago's linebacking
corps has been basically reduced
to nothing but Mike Singletary.

13. Denver- Broncos — Weak-
nesses: defensive line, secondary.
Selection: Tracy Armstrong, DE,

      
   

Florida. Denver failed to pry all-
pro free agent Bruce Smith from
Buffalo, so it will make due with
its first-round pick. In both the
Broncos recent Super Bowl loss-
es, the Giants and Redskins offen-

sive lines dominated Denver's

small defensive line thoroughly.

14. New York Jets — Weak-
nesses: running back, defensive
line, linebacker. Selection: Hart
Lee Dykes, \NR, Oklahoma State.
Jets love the idea of a Dykes-Al

rangy 6-4 — receiver combina-
tion. Dykes had an explosive

senior year worth 74 receptions,
1,278 yards and 14 touchdowns,
yet it was overshadowed by
Heisman-winner Barry Sanders.
15. Seattle Seahawks (from In-
dianapolis) — Weaknesses:
defensive line, wide receiver.
Selection: Andre Rison, WR,

Michigan State. Steve Largent’s
retirement could be devastating
to the team, although running

6 back John L. Williams was Seat-
_ tle’s leading receiver. Many _,

scouts consider Rison to be” the
best at his position in the draft.

16. New England Patriots -
Weaknesses: wide receiver, quar-
terback, defensive line. Selection:
Lawyer Tillman, WR, Auburn.
New England's passing attack has

become terrible. "Tillman. will-

help, but the quarterback situa-
tion remains the team's biggest
problem, since Tony Eason has

refused to stay healthy. Once
more, Walsh or Rosenbach.

17. Phoenix Cardinals (from
Seattle) — Weaknesses: defen-
sive line, secondary, linebacker.
Selection: Rodney Peete, QB,
Southern California. Surprise pick
of the draft, not who but by

whom. The Cardinals recently
signed the oft—injured Gary Hoge-
boom to back up starter Neil Lo-
max, but neither will be the
future-of.the team. Peete will be
brought along slowly.

18. New York Giants — Weak- ‘
nesses: running back, offensive -

line. Selection: Sammie Smith,

RB, Florida State. Giants blew it '

a few years ago by taking running
back George Adams, a bust, in
the first round-of the 1985 draft.
And old reliable Joe Morris is get"-'
ting, well, old. ‘If Smith stays
healthy, which he didn't in col-.

lege, he could be the Thurman
Thomas of 1989.

19. New Orleans Saints —
Weaknesses: secondary, defen-
sive line. Selection: Bill Hawkins,
DE, Miami (Fla.). This is a curious
year for the Saints. They have no
glaring weaknesses, yet no glar-

ing strengths. Twenty-two wins .

over the last two seasons, but
missed the playoffs last year. This
draft could put New Orleans over
the top or back into the pack.
Hawkins is definitely an over-the-
top player.

20. Indianapolis Colts (from
Philadelphia) — Weaknesses:
defensive line, secondary. Selec-
tion: Rhondy Weston, DT, Flori-
da. When Indy turned to battered
defensivelineman Joe Klecko for

help last season, you knew the

Colts were in trouble there.
Weston’s 6-5, 275-pound size
will wreak enough havoc inside
to turn loose the Colts’ fine line-
backers and DE John Hand.

21. Clevel-and Browns
Weaknesses: defensive line,
offensive line. Selection: Tracy

Rocker, DT, Auburn. Rocker’s .

status slipped some during the
1989 combines due to his poor
speed“(5.2) in the 40. Forget it.
Rocker is a player. If Cleveland
had this guy over the last three

J seasons, the Browns would have

made at least one Super Bowl ap-
pearance, : ’

22. 'Los_ Angeles Rams —
Weaknesses: -secondary, defen-
_sive line. Selection: Brian Smith,

DE, Auburn. The Rams were ‘

devastated defensively with the
loss of seven defensive players to
free agency. Los Angeles needs to
revamp its line, as Minnesota
proved in last year's wild-card
‘ playoff. Smith, who some project
as a linebacker, should fit nicely
in the Rams
alignment.’ _'
23. Houston Oilers -»Weak-
nesses: secondary, linebacker.
Selection: Jeff Lageman, LB, Vir-

ginia. Talk about devastating!’

Draft

backers, to free agency. The Oil-
ers have no true standouts at the
position. The rangy Lageman will
contribute.

24. Minnesota Vikings —
Weaknesses: defensive line,
offensive line, secondary. Selec-
tion: Tom Ricketts, OT, Pitts-
burgh. The San Francisco pass
rush was all over quarterback
Wade Wilson in last year's NFC
semifinal. lfthe talented Vikings
want to reach the Super Bowl,
they’d better get more rushing
production and keep the quarter-
back off his back. Might as well
continue to build up front, after
taking guard Randall McDaniel
as last year's number one.

25. Chicago Bears — Weak-
nesses: offensive line, secondary.
Selection: Joe Wolf, G, Boston
College. After using its earlier two
picks to build the defense’, Chica-
go will call on Wolf to keep QB
McMahon healthy (if metaphysi-
cally possible) and rusher Neal
Anderson productive. 1

26. Los Angeles Rams (from
Buffalo) — Weaknesses: secon-
dary, offensive line. Selection:
Steve Wisniewski, G, Penn State.

Same philosophy here. QB Jim
Everett is the franchise man and
Greg Bell pounds out the yard-
age. The Rams’ offensive linemen
have been there so long they are
becoming petrified. As in wood,
not Friday the 13th, Part 34.

27. Cincinnati Bengals —
Weaknesses: defensive line, line-
backer. Selection: Mitchell Ben-
son-, DT, Texas Christian.
Remember what happened to
nose tackle Tim Krumrie in the
past Super Bowl? That, and the
bust that is former first—rounder
DL Jason Buck, forces this pick
for the AFC champions.

28. San Francisco 49ers —
Weaknesses: secondary, line-
backer, wide receiver. Selection:
Carnell Lake, S, UCLA. The glue
that holds together the S.F. secon-
dary, Ronnie Lott, is also becom-
ing aged. Played linebacker in
college, but has the perfect phy-
sique to be an NFL safety. Draft-
nik Mel Kiper claims Lake could
have been a top ten pick had the
Bruins played him at safety.

76ers’ Cliff Robinson
back in rehabilitation

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -— Cliff
Robinson has returned to his
rehabilitation program after a
week's layoff to give his ach-
ing left knee a rest as the .
Philadelphia 76ers look ahead
to the NBA playoffs.

Robinson is coming back
slowly from an operation to
repair a splintered kneecap.
Team physician Ray Moyer
said last week that he hadn't
ruled out the possibility of
Robinson's return to the
lineup for the playoffs.

Sixers General Manager
John Nash must submit the
team's playoff roster by Sun-
day, and Robinson's name is
not likely to be on it, The
Philadelphia Inquirer reported
Tuesday.

Nash‘ and "Robinson will
meet..Iater this week to discuss

the veteran fon/vard’s situation
with the team, the general
manager said.

”I’llbe meeting with Cliff
just to get a sense of where we
are,” Nash said.

Robinson will be an unres-
tricted free agent when the Six-
ers finish the playoffs. That
means he could sign to play
with any NBA team, but de-
mand for him is not expected
to be great because of the in-
jury that kept him off the court
for the final 65 games of the
season.

Nash said he didn't expect
to offer Robinson a. contract
soon.

”We’re going . to probably

he said.
