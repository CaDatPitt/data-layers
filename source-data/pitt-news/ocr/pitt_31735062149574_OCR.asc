Executive Committee Offers
12-Point SFA Program,
Gives Appointments

It took SFA’s executive committee,
old and new, almost two hours to eat
at the Schenley Wednesday night, but
when they ﬁnally pushed back the
coffee and went after the cigarettes,
they entered into a business meeting
which should have far-reaching ef-
fects.

Immediately approved was the 18-
or 19-point program which was con-

’ sidered this year; then the group got

down to the business of considering
the proposed 33-point additional pro-
gram which covered three and one-
half mimeographed pages. On this
program were suggestions put forth
by students and faculty members, for
the most part by executive commit-
teemen themselves.

Included in this list were ideas ex-
tending from parking problems and
smoking regulations to the possibili-
ties for a University press and better
intercollegiate relations in Pitts-
burgh. From this heterogeneous as-
sortment 12 were accepted as worthy
of recommmendation to the entire as-
sembly for further action, ﬁve others
were incorporated into two commit-
tees, while the remaining 16 were
either referred to the social commit-
tee or were discarded.

Recommend 12 Points

In the order in which the sugges-
tions were discussed and approved,
the following recommendations will
be made to the assembly at its special
meeting next Tuesday:

1. To study the parking conditions
about the University to determine
means of improvement and to elim-
inate -encroachment upon neighbor-
ing property by parking in driveways,
on lawns, etc.

2. A committee on football demon-
strations and stunts to study the ac-
tivities of other universities. and as
an outgrowth, the establishment of a
demonstration block whose members
would rehearse theirdemonstratiovcs
under faculty instruction.

3. A planning committee for the
spring festival program, to revise a
program probably over-balanced with
dances, and to replace them with more
of the “carnival-fair” ideas.

4- To have graduating classes do-
nate special windows to the Univer-
sity library.

5. Careful planning in order to
provide at least one assembly each
semester similar to the Phelps as-

New Druids Elect
1936-37 Officers

Levison, Altamari, Liddell, Kairys
Named To Executive Group

Leonard Levison, C, was elected
president of Druids, sophomore hon-
orary, for the year 1936-37 at a meet-
ing held Wednesday evening in the
Cathedral Mansions.

Other new officers are David Alti-

mari C. vice president; J. Spencer
Liddell, C, secretary; and Albert
Kairys, C, treasurer.

Levison, whose main activity is

sports reporter for The News, had lit-
tle or no trouble being e1ected"as
leader of the so-called “Alpha” bloc.
Two, and in one case three, ballots
were necessary, however, to elect the
other oﬂicers, with Kairys, a non-
fraternity man, breaking through to
capture the treasurer’s position.

Levison’s ﬁrst official act was the
appointment of Louis Reilly, M39, as
social chairman. Plans are being laid
for a joint dinner dance on June 8,
with D. C. Schultz, BA38, of this
year’s Druid organization, as chair-
man.

The presentation of the Druid
plaque to the outstanding sophomore
man, a precedentset by last year’s
Druids, and thus far disregarded by
the outgoing organization, was again
suggested. It was decided to defer
the presentation until the Druid
smoker in the fall; however, Frank
Engel, E38, gave deﬁnite assurance
that it would be awarded.

Levison has called a meeting of the
old and new executive committees for
Friday afternoon at the Pi Kappa
Alpha house to discuss a tentative
program for the coming year, in order
that another business meeting might
be held before the close of this
semester.

Engineering Society Plans
Demonstration Of Robots

The Engineering Society, a group
formed by the University and Car-
negie Tech engineering alumni as a

Thomas, of the research department
of the Westinghouse Company, will
give the presentation in the Engineer-
ing Society -Room of the William
Penn Hotel, at 8 o'clock.

E. W. Mason, E33, is chairman of
the society. .~

lnterfraternity Council Recommends
Abolition Of Strennous ‘Hell Week’

Group Approves Proposed
Adviser System, Votes
To Curtail Rushing

Recommending the abandonment of
all forms of physical punishment, In-
terfraternity Council went on record
Tuesday evening as opposed to stren-
uous initiation periods and to all
other actions which might hold up the
fraternity system to ridicule or em-
barrassment.

This move was taken after recom-
mendations made by the 'National'In-
terfraternity Conference last Decem-
ber, at which national officers of all
fraternities represe-nted in the Uni-
versity I—F Council advanced the idea.

Action toward lightening the initia-
tion ceremony and shortening “Hell
I/Veek” to 96 hours was taken upon
recommendation of the Hell Week
committee appointed by William Hou-
sel, C37, Delta Tau Delta, at the
meeting of May 5. Members who con-
ducted the investigation and compiled
the report included Hubert Teitel-
baum, C37, Phi Epsilon Pi, chairman,
Donald Pritchard, BA37, Delta Tau
Delta, Charles Manterﬁeld, C37, Theta
Chi, and Alex Willson, C38, Lambda
Chi Alpha.

’ Favor Resident Advisers

After discussion led by N. Robert
Seidle, assistant to the dean of men
and fraternity adviser, Council decid-
ed unanimously in favor of obtaining
resident faculty advisers. These, Sei-
dle explained, would be graduate
members of the fraternity preferably
from another chapter, who would live
at the chapter house and act as ad-
visers, tutors, and academic supervi-
sors.

In return for these services, it was
agreed that each fraternity should pro-
vide its adviser with free room and
board, and the University authorities
have agreed to provide free tuition
in any ‘school of the University for
graduate work for the period in which
the adviser is active.

Changes in the rushing rules were
made to shorten the actual rushing
period to one week, and to lengthen
the time between registration and the
opening of rushing to three weeks.
Rushing for the ﬁrst semester of 1936-
37 will begin Monday, October 12, at
8 o’clock and end on Sunday morning,
October 18, at 2 o'clock.

Rooney Replaces Scheib

Steve Rooney, C38, Phi Kappa, was
appointed to replace Raymond Scheib,
C37, Phi Kappa, as rushing chairman-
at-large.

Seidle announced that the annual
banquet of the Fraternity Cooperative
Buying Association, postponed this
semester because of the ﬂood, will be
held in October, at which time the
efficiency prize, at present held by
Phi Gamma Delta, will be awarded.

Closing business for the year with
this special meeting called by Housel
to consider ideas of the Hell VVeek
committee, the Council met at the
Phi Kappa house-

Panther, Fully Clothed,
Appears In Light Mind

All you eager readers who have

sheet, states positively that the
much-touted humoresque will ap-
pear on campus today,

“We are now in a position to
exhibit,” said Connolly, “because
the covers have arrived.” He said
more about delayed shipments and
stuff. but let’s not go into that
now.

have been looking for ever since high
school graduation is now available
with the opening of a seven-day ad-
vertising course, absolutely free.

Executive Groups
Plan Y Programs

YM Will Collaborate With YW'

On New Projects For Year

Although the YMCA hasn’t been
breaking into the news lately, activity
in that organization is more pro-

nounced at this time than at any
other during the past year. The
group is preparing next season's
plans.

Although over 600 sponsored meet-
ings, attended by 34,215 students,
make a good record for any campus
organization, the cabinet and council,
executive bodies, together with
Charles Skuce, C37, the newly-elected
Y president, and William W. Menden-
hall, executive secretary, are busy
preparing a different type of program
that is expected to reach even more
of the student body.;

According to ».Mendenhall, the
YMCA intends to collaborate with the
YWCA in sponsoring certain projects
and events for next year. For exam-
ple, the social service work done by
the groups will be headed jointly by
Grace Kovac, C38, and Robert Wood-
ruff, C38. Last year this branch con-
tacted over 10,000 underprivileged
children in the city settlement houses-

‘The Song Has Ended’

EW DRUIDS elected ofﬁcers for the year on a full

stomach, as is customary with the sophomore hon-
orary, VVednesday, but this time in a little different man-
ner than in previous spring banquet elections. Now this
does not imply that previous elections of the national
fraternity were traditional and parallel in a.ll respects.
Every one of them rotated the beef steak, mashed potato
diet with one of chicken and creamed peas. Last Wed-
nesday’s election, however, did differ when the select
vote was not “unanimous.”

To explain unanimous, we might turn to the election
two springs ago when of the four ofﬁcers to be elected,
only one, that of president, was put into office on an ac-
tual vote; and the winner’s majority on this ballot had
plenty to spare, 9-5. Only the formality of a single nom-
ination, followed by a motion for the nominations to be
closed, was necessary to “select” the remaining oilicers
for the year. This was a typical election of past
Druids.

Next year, however, the oﬂicers go into oﬁice with a
healthily-contested election behind them. This should
do the organization much good.

It is surprising to note how much importance has been
attached to the movements of this particular honorary.
Many students have been heard to say “Druids must be
the only honorary at the University.” What, then, is all
the discussion about?

Well, in short, crusaders combating a. strangle-hold
coalition control of the group in the past have brought
about this situation. In the past few years Druids has
been pushed through a deﬁnite “open-door” policy that
should satisfy even the most rabid crusader. So let’s
just forget all about the Druid iraternity that was, and
look at the present group as arriving on an equal plane
with similar “honorary” fraternities. The most serious
objection to such a course will be the refrains of those
few who will hum “The song has ended, but the melody
lingers on.”

Druids needn’t bother about those few.—E. H. B.

A Word To The Visitors

ISITING HIGH SCHOOL women journalists who

will be a part of Xyl»on’s tenth anniversary celebra-
tion today are in for a happy round of events if the ‘Era-
ternity’s plans are any criteria at all.

These so-called Xylon Days—most prominent of the
group's program for the year—become proof of their own
worth when they attract such large delegations of prom-
ising students of journalism. That an extraordinary per-
centage of the visitors eventually enroll here is an ad-
mitted poi-nt, but not all-important.

It may be that one of today’s visitors will a few years
from now be composing for these very columns a few
words of welcome to other girl high school journalists.
We hope that her memories of the aﬁai-r today and the
enjoyment her associates had will encourage her to give
a warm welcome and even some hearty congratulations
to the visitors then.

Scanning the semester

Remember when Bill Housel was the favored lad in
Jean Lawson’s company? . . and Lyda Baltz was on
the Fiji black list for rushing Phi Delt? Ruthie
Mills and Moe Rosenbloom went to town every day in
Moe's convertible? . . . Lucy Conn and A1 Treusch were
shopping for a PiKA pin? . . Bill Schenck:(SFA
prexy) deserted Pitt for PCW’s Jane Seaton? . .
Bernie Summers carried Rachel Stowe’s books and Ra-
chel carried Bowdler’s ring? Walter Good, Bob
Weitershausen, Ellis Tumpson, Tom Howard, Jack Bod-
kin, John Shirley, Chuck Herald, Chick Keenoy, and the
Statistics Dept. ate their hearts out for Betty Black?
. . Tumpson moved out to Hobart Street? . . Bill
Fox and Bea Abbiss were better friends than they are
today? . . Marion Epping ﬁrst pinned on Joe Rodger’s
Philiap pin?

Campus comment

Sylvia Fixel and Jack Bodkin both have that same
look in their orbs . . she's got his pin (SAE) . .
Kappa Louise McKirdy has announced her engagement
to Sid Friedman . t’was expected . . Peggie
Speer, Lucy Conn and Elva Silsby attended last week’s
Theta formal . . what? no Greek barriers?
Pittsburgh Press: Please note

Excerpt. Sunday edition, May 17. “The season’s ﬁnal
production of the Pitt Players will take place Wednesday
and Thursday. They will offer “Cock Robin” by Elmer
Rice and Philip Barry in the Pittsburgh Playhouse on
Craft Avenue. The show is under the direction of Carl
B. Cass.”

As far as we know “Cock Robin” has been postponed
until next semester. W’e hope that the Press critic won’t
be on hand for curtain.

Queries

Tom Bricker is lying awake nights because of a tall,
dark frosh' . what Phi Kap thinks that Mortar
Board prexy Ruth Seitz is okeh? He recently
toted a pan of red-hots up the hill for the MB stand at
the Carnival . . . How’s come all the football players
sun themselves on the Tri Delt porch?

This one is told on Moe Rosenbloom It seems
that years ago, Moe was allowed by the b0=ys to pitch
for their mushball team . . As a. gag they bought him
a book, entitled “How to Pitch Mushball.” Moe stu-
diously followed the advice of the text and went in there
to do or die . . It seems, however, that the opposition
were gleaning thousands of hits . . In the middle of
an inning, Moe left the game, ran across the lot, and
brought out the book . . . He ran up to the catcher and
said, “look here . . . it says on Page 45 that the catcher
is supposed to talk it up for the pitcher . You’re
lying down on the job."

Vacations

lBetty Knop and Bill Kuhn each get a trip to Europe
this year . Ray Richman and Al Heller start for
the Pacific coast the middle of June . and Deke

Bowcller goes to Cleveland.

Swan song

Dear Helen M: I suggest that you try out for this
column next semester . . . Your contribution was pretty
good.

Short, Short Story

At the University of Syracuse a professor locked the
door exactly at the start of class. One minute later a
group of students pounded on the door and howled, “We
demand our inalienable rights.” The student left outside
ﬁnally called the janitor to unlock the door. The pro-

"fes'sor'gave'a warning that -the ﬁrst -person to-enter the

room would be forcibly evicted. When the door opened,
in walked the school wrestling champ. The professor
turned red, ﬁngered his pipe nervously, and dismissed
the class. -

Dr. Hance Writes
On Teach ing Blind
A bout Illeiidelism

Dr. Robert T. Hance, professor of
biology, is the author of an article in
the April issue of the Journal of He-
redity, publication of the American
Genetic Association. Dr. Hance’s ar-
ticle is “Mendelism for the Blind.”
It deals with the successful teaching
of the sightless in laboratory courses
in biological sciences.

Dr, Hance tells_ ﬁrst how he ca.me
to experiment with wire solder and
soft aluminum wire twisted into the
desired shapes and cemented to card-
board to take the place of the outline
drawings on the blackboard Eventu-
ally labels in Braille were attached to
these wire drawings, making them
permanently useful.

The representation of Mendel’s law
of heredity was satisfactorily solved
by making characters or genes of bits
of wire of varying shapes and sizes.
In all cases the larger shape is as-
sumed to be dominant to the smaller
one.

By the use of cardboard boxes and
the wire a checkerboard has been
worked out by which the blind stu-
dent can determine the results of all
types of cross breeding according to
Mendel’s law. The article is illus-
trated by three photographs of repre-
sentative wire diagrams with their

Braille inscriptions.

at the report and at the same time
hoping for a fair and cooler prediction
for tomorrow,

This speciﬁc group is made up of
some 1,250 college coaches, high
school coaches, and players from ﬁve
states, who will attend Dr. “Jock”
Sutherland’s ﬁfth annual football
clinic at the Stadium tomorrow.

With the opening of the clinic sched-
uled for 9 o’clock in the morning Dr.
Sutherland, his assistant coaches, and
varsity players will get right down to
the main point of the; clinic, the
fundamentals of football.

The entire morning session will be
devoted to the demonstration of every
position, using both offensive and de-
fensive methods and stressing the
importance of fundamentals. Using
the varsity football team for the'dem-
onstrations, seven assistant coaches
of the Panther squad will direct the
exhibits.

Dinner At Schenley

Eddie Hirshberg will direct the
ends; Bill Kern, the tackles; Mike
Milligan, the guards; Ralph Daugher-
ty, the centers; Eddie Baker, the quar-
terbacks; Mike Nicksick, the half-
backs; and Charlie Bowser, the full-
backs,

After the varsity men have worked
up a good appetite and the assem-
bly has one just from watching the
boys work, the spectators will move
to the Hotel Schenley for dinner.

At 12:15, two of the country’s out-
standing college coaches will speak.
H. 0. “Fritz” Crisler, Princeton coach,
will give his ideas on “End Play and
General Defensive Tactics,” while
Wallace ‘Wade, Duke University coach,
will speak on “Offensive Line Play.”

Following the dinner and speeches
the clinic moves back up to the Sta-
dium for further demonstrations and
blackboard strategy. The clinic will
close at 4:30 o’clock.

Teachers At The Grid School

Pan their Nettcrs
Face Penn State
Outﬁt Tomorrow

While Coach Jock Sutherland is ex-
plaining the fundamentals of football
at the Stadium, Coach Dave O’Lough-
lin’s Pitt tennis team hopes to be
showing Penn State a few principles
of the net game when the two outﬁts
exchange strokes on the Trees Gym-
nasium courts tomorrow afternoon.

This is the last home stand for the
Panthers this season, and a victory
would make the home record for the
year unblemished. Next week the
shorts-clads will travel to Washington,
D. C., and Annapolis for three matches
against Georgetown, George Wash-
ington, and Navy.

Penn State defeated Pitt last year
in the annual meeting by a 6-3 score,
and according to reports from Nit-
tany Lion headquarters, conditions

 

along the tennis front haven't chang— _

ed during the past twelve months.

After experimenting earlier in the
season, Coach O’Loughlin found a
combination that has yet to taste de-
feat, Bob Madden, Ralph Bald, Cap-
tain Joe Madden, Irv Solow, John Mo-
gan, and Roy Heckler make up the
outﬁt, and Bill M.cKenna and Jimmy
Thompson are used in doubles play.

Up to the W & J contest yesterday,
the netters had won seven straight
this season. Bald, Solow, McKenna,
and Mogan are sophomores, Bob Mad-
den is a junior, and Joe Madden,
Thompson, and Heckler await the
awarding of diplomas.

tor over the Panther junior-varsity,

the season. : .

the anchor leg of the relay to cap that
race for Coach Potts’ squad. ’ ” 

Wood ﬁnished ﬁrst in the low hur-
dles, second in the high hurdles, and
third in three events, the 100, 220, and
high jump.

PANTHER BOOSTER

Golf Team Ends
Season In W. & J.
Tilt Tomo rrow

Panther golfers swing into their
swan song tomorrow afternoon at Al-
coma Country Club when they trade
putts with Washington and J efferson’s
undefeated outﬁt. It is the last sched-
uled match of the season for Coach
Snyder’s linksmen.

This engagement was originally
carded for earlier in the season but
bad weather caused a postponement
until tomorrow. At Washington, Pa.,
recently, the Panthers did their best
to stop the Prexies’ winning streak
but the most they could do was get a
41/2-4% tie.

Coach Jimmy Devlin, W & J head
man, will probably start the same
team that was used in the ﬁrst en-
gagement. In that event Gould will
-handle the No. 1 duties. Gould drop-
ped a 3 and 1 decision to Souchak
although he shot a 76, He’ll probably
face the grid star again tomorrow.

Wayman against Symonds is the
lineup for the second pairing. The
W & J star nicked Pat with a 1 up
score, and indications point to an-
other close duel. In No. 3 rank will
be Wasco, Pitt, and Groshell, W’ & J.
VVasco holds the edge here by virtue
of a 6 and 5 victory in the ﬁrst meet-
1ng_

Sam Musico will be anxious to get
even with Butch Miller in the fourth
match, the husky President taking a
2 and 1 decision in the ﬁrst affair.
Bob Mease will tackle Elder, and Bob
Baughman will face Butters in the
concluding singles contests. Elder is
1 up on Mease and Baughman is in
ﬁrst place over Butters.

Four tennis courts and just as
many mushball ﬁelds are being given
expert attention by the ground-keep-
ing crew these days as the Intramural
tennis and mushball tourneys ap-
proach the championship stage with
all sails open. ~

The tennis courts are being oc-
cupied by the second aud third round-
ers. Starting Monday, the round-
robin was originally scheduled for a
Friday ﬁnale. Rain and varsity
matches interfered. As a result of the
second and third rounds and even
some of the ﬁrst are still to be com-
pleted. Pairings will be found on the
Cathedral bulletin board.

First team to make a deﬁnite bid
for one of the three bronze trophies in
Greek play was Sigma Alpha Mu.

Freshmen Review 

Program Of Units
At Mentor‘ Tea

Women Finish Apprentice Work
In 11 Activity Groups Under
Upperclass Guidance

By Muriel White

Forty-two senior mentors were
guests of honor at a tea sponsored
by the Freshman Council on Wednes-
day afternoon at the Heinz House
from 3:30 until 5 o’clock.

Four of the freshman units pre-
sented the program at the tea. Betty
Adams of the dramatic unit, Delta
Lambda, gave a monologue character-
izing the “campus smoothie;” the
sports unit, Sportolites, presented a
musical skit; Mary Jane Patterson,
representing the ﬁne arts unit, gave"
a resume of the work done by the
unit this year; while the,stagecra1’t,
unit displayed two of the puppets’
which they have made.

The work done by the freshman
units under the guidance of the ad-
visers has been varied this term.
Mothers’ teas, dinners, lectures, and
tours have been included in the pro-
gram of the eleven units.

Pantheriters, the publications unit,
published the “Freshman Review,”
the ﬁrst freshman printed paper, un-
der the advisorship of Sara Harris,
C36. The group also entertained wo-
men members of the staffs of the Owl,
News, and Panther at a tea on Mon-
day at Heinz House, and heard talks
throughout the year by the heads of
the various campus publications.

Acting Unit Gives Three Plays

The acting unit, Delta Lambda, pro-
duced three one-act plays in the Falk
Elementary School, and gave two per-
formances of the plays before local
organizations. All the members of
the unit participated in the plays.
Delta Lambda also lists among its ac-
tivities a tea at which Mr. Karl Wil-
liams, instructor of the King School
of Oratory, spoke before the group.
Frances Goodwin, Ed36, is adviser to
the unit.

“Les Pittites Francaises,” a French
paper, was published by the French
unit under the advisorship of Ruth
Recht, Ed37. During the year the
members of the unit have improved on
their conversational French and have
heard speeches by the members of the
Modern Languages department.

Questors, the science unit, list
among their activities for the year a
tour through Mellon Institute, and
Heinz plant, a visit to the West Penn
Hospital to view an operation, and
a series of lectures by prominent bi-
oiogists. Blanche Shore, C36, is the
adviser of the group.

This semester the fine arts unit,
with Dorothy Miller, C37, as adviser,
sponsored, in collaboration with
‘WCEL, an exhibit of Van Gogh repro-
ductions at the Heinz House, Other
activities of the group were a visit
to the International Art Exhibit; a
tour through the ﬁne arts library,
conducted by ‘Walter Hovey, acting
head of the department; and a
Japanese Tea.

Scripsit To Appear Soon

Members of Pitt Parla.nce, public
speaking unit, had their voices record-
ed, held debates and panel discussions
on “Coeducation,” and heard John
Henry, Pittsburgh lawyer, speak on
the “Supreme Court,” at their meet-
ings. Elizabeth Glass, Ed36, advised
the group.

The most important activity of the
Glee Club unit this year was the spon-
soring of the Inter-class sing for the
freshman class. Group adviser was
Virginia Long, Ed36.

Scripsit, the literary unit, under the
leadership of Ola M_cGrail, C36, wrote
material for publication and will pub-
lish a magazine which is to be releas-
ed next week. The group entertain-
ed Quill, honorary literary fraternity,
and held a tea for the publications
unit.

Learning to make puppets was the
chief project of the Skeen Skill or
sta.ge craft unit which Virginia Kirk,
C37, advised.

The Dramatic discussion unit under
Lyda Baltz’s guidance, discussed
plays, and became more familiar with
stage technique at their meetings.
The group also saw various stage pro-
ductions and heard prominent men
discuss the theater.

Sportolites, the sports unit, claim
as their chief accomplishment of the
year the basketball championship
which they won at the Inter-class
Basketball Tournament. The mem-
bers have held roller skating parties,
swimming events, and go to the gym
once a week to participate in various
sports. Audrey Graham, Ed37, is
adviser of the group.
