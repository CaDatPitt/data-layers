To Feature Campaign

Spirited C o n t e s t Seen

Fifteen men’s fraternities will rush
approximately 550 freshmen and
transfer students beginning at 8:30
o’clock this morning. From today un-
til 2 o’clock Sunday morning, October
14, rushees will be favored guests at
an unlimited number of dances and
other social affairs.

For nine days, students affected by
rushing will be given free lunches,
dinners, smokes and blind dates.

Silence period will begin Sunday
morning, October 14, and extend until
5 o’clock Thursday afternoon, Octo-
ber 18. During this period no conver-
sation is allowed between any man
affiliated with a fraternity and new
students.

N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men and fraternity adviser,

made the following statement:

“All rushees, while guests at any
fraternity house, should feel free to.
make all inquiries concerning the
ﬁnancial status of the house, its mem-I
bership, its assessments, its dues, its
activities and its scholastic standing.

“Be prepared with all the ﬁrst hand
information that you acquire. When
you are called to my oﬂice to an-
nounce your choice of a fraternity,
you will have a clear viewpoint on
fraternities as a whole and a founded
opinion of a. speciﬁc fraternity that
you would like to join.

“You can feel free to consult me
at any time, on any question regard-
ing fraternities.”

Leonard Marks
Chosen Chairman
As Derr Resigns

Meeting Of

Dinner General
Assembly Called For
October 16

By Charles B. Holstein

Leonard Marks, a senior in the
College, is the new chairman of
the executive committee of the
University Assembly.

King Derr, C35, who was elect-
ed to that position last spring,
submitted his resignation Tues-
day, before the ﬁrst regular meet-
ing of the Assembly’s executive
committee.

Miss Thyrsa W’. Amos, dean of wo-
men, Dr. Vincent W’. Lanfear, dean of
men, Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
dean of men, Marks, George Roll, C35
Jules Green, C35, and Charles Herald:
C35, who now compose the executive
body, accepted Derr’s resignation.

“I am pleased to submit my resig-
nation as chairman of the executive
committee of the University Assem-
bly,” read Derr’s statement, which
;was received by Dr. Lanfear. Derr
lgave scholastic difﬁculties as the rea-
‘son for his withdrawal from the high-
,est campus office open to students.

E Marks, previously vice-chairman of
the group, was elected to ﬁll the va-
, cancy:

This action opened the business of
meeting marked by
the consummation of a number of im-
portanfqrqesolutions affecting the com-
mittee’s- program for the semester.

(1) The executive committee
will ﬁll the vacancy in its person-
nel and in the general assembly at
its meeting Tuesday afternoon.

(2) The designation of a com-
mittee on appointments, com-
prised of ﬁve members, was sug-
gested and approved. This com-
mittee will hereafter survey the
petitions of all students for Uni-
versity positions, reduce the num-
ber, and recommend appointments
to the executive group. The de-
cisions of the sub-committee will
not be ﬁnal.

(3) A dinner meeting of the
general assembly will be held Oc-
tober 16.

 

Senior graduates in February are,

Donald Campbell, C35, president of
the College Association and a mem-

_ , _ _ iber of the assembly, was appointed to
important activity of the bureau 1s.head the Appointments

sub-commit-
tee. Serving under him will be the
following assembly members: Jane
Booth, C36-; Joseph Rodgers, C36;
Marks; and Robert M. Ayars, profes-
sor of accounting.

This committee will begin func-
tioning this afternoon when petition-
ers for the Soph Hop chairmanship
will be interviewed. The three or
four sophomores who submit the most
convincing arguments of their capa-
bilities will be interviewed by the ex-
ecutive committee Tuesday afternoon,
and at that time the ﬁnal choice will
be made.

At 3:30 every Tuesday afternoon
henceforth the executive committee
will hold meetings in the office of the
dean of men. Beginning October 16,
the general assembly will meet each
month. '

Derr’s resignation, according to Dr.
Lanfear, causes the los-s to SFA of a
valuable member. Derr is president
of Sigma. Alpha Epsilon, national so-
cial fraternity, was editor of the
freshman handbook, is aﬁiliated with
the cabinet of the YMCA, and was
prominent last year in Interfraternity
council circles. Marks, a non-frater-
nity man, is a member of Pi Tau Phi,
national honorary scholastic frater-
nity.

On Wednesday, Derr expressed con-
ﬁdence in Marks’ ability to lead the
SFA in its initial year on campus.

 

Seidle Reveals Incomplete
Freshman Housing Figures

Incomplete ﬁgures as disclosed by
N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men, show that there are 170
out-of-town freshmen on the campus,
124 of whom are living in approved
boarding houses. The others are liv-
ing with relatives or close friends.

It is necessary that all freshmen
living in these homes sign contracts
and have copies ﬁled in the Housing
bureau office, Room 801, Cathedral, by
today.

And All’s Well
TUESDAY’S MEETIN7G~ of the
University Assembly s execu-

tive committee shows the advant-
age of starting from scratch. Po-
litically speaking: the new gov‘
erning body has no memory and
no traditions.

This is a contrast to the Stu-
dent Council arrangement, where-
by the standard spoils were so
well known beforehand that they
were carefully channelized before
September.

Under this
campus party system became so
well deﬁned in pursuit of dance
chairmanships that a Pitt NGWS
reporter’s phrase neatly stamped
the parties, “alpha,” and “beta.”

That these deﬁnitions may be
outdated appeared at the execu-
tive session, when the committee
moved to make dance chairman-
ships the concern of a special sub-
committee. The sub-colnmittee
will receive applications and in-
terview candidates, reporting the
names of three or four to the ex-
ecutive committee, which has ﬁnal

arrangement the

choice. .
VVhile the executive commlttee

is about it, it might consider
methods of reducing the Whlte
light that beats about a dance
chairman. As long as fraterni-
ties believe that a Soph Hop
chairmanship will atone for a
leaky roof and a low scholastic
rating, campus logrolling will go
on through the wind and the
rain.

 

Rushing Week
EN’S FRATl:lRNlTIES begin

4 this morning the cheerful,
exciting business of attracting
pledges, and special hospitalities
are scheduled for the next ten
days.

This year there are particular
reasons for the earnestness of
the rushers, and the various so-
cial maneuvers will be very care-
ful investments, as fraternities
here seek to discover whether
they are going to continue as be-
fore through the sixth year of
the depression.

Fortunately, most of the Uni-
versity chapters hold properties
that are largely unencumbered or
for which they pay moderate
rents. ln this respect they
haven’t the bleak budgets of fra-
ternities housed in campus castles
elsewhere.

But local chapters have felt for
three or four years the pinch of
decreased student means, and
some chapters are hopefully, a
little sadly, looking for freshmen
windfalls as the only way of keep-
ing aﬂoat. The more anxious ones
will splurge expensively, while
members go dancing with tears
in their eyes.

VVe hope that, along with cer-
tain other infallible signs of an
economic recovery, fraternity ac-
ceptances will considerably in-
crease this year. But we suggest
to a rushee that when the brother
maneuvers him into the next
room to say with tense non-
chalance that the initiation fee is
so-much, he should ask speciﬁc
questions about the ﬁnancial
status of the chapter.

To Those In The Cold
OPHOMORES WHO were not tap-
ped into Druids, national activities
fraternity, should strive to be con-
soled in their disappointment.

Membership in Druids represents a
very complicated sort of achieve-
ment, not a little of which requires
activity, along with social acceptabil-
ity to the young Bourbons who make
up Druids. But in attempting to be
select, Druids have to bar a good
many who are capable of the standard
achievement.

Doubtless the honorary serves the
purpose of a p-leasant social club, but
it need not expect to be considered
an objective estimate of success or
failure among the men of 1938.

VVe submit congratulations to the
three good men tapped Wednesday
and to the rest of the sophomore
class.

 

IThinking It Overl

By Edwin Banks
“Copperﬁeld” and Dickens

Out in Hollywood they are now
working on, if they haven't already
completed, a movie version of Charles
Dickens’ “David Copperﬁeld.” Soon
we shall see the familiar characters
of that famous novel before our eyes.
But that will be another story.

Right now I’d like to apologize to
the author for the severe way I chas-
tized him in a couple of English Novel
papers last year. “Martin Chuzzlewit”
reﬂected Dickens as a comic-strip nov-
elist dishing out sloppy sentiment,
melodrama, and one-trait grotesques.
With the original impression of that
book still unchanged, I recently ﬁn-
ished “David Copperﬁeld” which I
had read once before when entirely

too young to appreciate its 900 pages,
I am. ready to bow today before a
genius, an incredible master story-;
teller, an accomplished characterizer
in his best moments,- a_ rare dramatist,
a magician of laughter and tears—-
and yet a writer of sloppy sentiment,
melodrama, and one-trait grotesques.

To paraphrase somebody, Dickens
you can criticize too easily and can’t
forget.

Peggoty and Aunt Trotwood are ex-
cellent, Steerforth pretty good, Trad-
dles and his Sophy delightful.
Micawber and that dear creature who
wouldn’t desert him are enjoyable
ca_ricatures_ Agnes is a little tedious
at times, like Amelia in “Vanity Fair;”
Uriah Heep, impossible; Dick and his
kites a pleasing fantasy. David, ap-
parently, is pretty much or altogether
Dickens.

And what is Dickens? He has
crammed volumes into his book,
dozens of people, scores of dramatic
scenes, hundreds of laughs, too many
tears. To the debit side, of course,
are the intricate mysteries, the cheap
villains, the women more sinned
against than sinning, the faints, the
salt water, and the heaps of funny
details that grow slightly boring.
Above them all, however, is a general
realistic tone, sober and sweet.

Dickens is a. romanticist for all his
sordid details; they, too, are romantic.
His cynicism is purely emotional as is
his humanitarianism. Not 9. deep
thinker like Eliot, he must have his
villains and his heroes and his melo-
drama. Even Steerforth, the lovable
half-scamp», smacks of the stock com-
pany stage.

You can like or despise so easily
the man who, like Dickens, feels; you
ﬁnd it hard to do more than respect
the man who thinks. That is, relative-
ly speaking. If you absorb most
keenly the stuff of literature which
you believe reveals life as it is, you
will consider the writers who have
thought as well as felt the greater
nove1ists_ Eliot, Tolstoi. and Mann

The Pitt News

are examples of the latter class.

Dickens is not quite the complete,x
the mature observer and interpreter.I
He is a great writer who never had-
his creative gift impaired by too much
thought on the three-quarters real
world he portrayed.

the 7:30 o’clock shift.

He heard the screeching staccato of
the rivet hammers; giant girders
squeaking over his head, crashing to
the ﬂoor; rotary p-laners clashing off
steel chips monotonously; rivet fur-
naces roaring withering heat.

He saw three bandaged ﬁngers,
rough hands with stumps for ﬁngers,
2. man with a white hole of skin for
an eye.

His ‘ears rang, wheels revolved be-
hind his eyes, sweat oozed on his.
sallow face.

“I'd like to go outside for a minute,”
he said to his boss_

“Sure, go ahead, but don’t forget
to come back.”

The boss had more than one ﬁrst
day man pass out on the job.

Jack McDonald forgot to come back.

fulltime instructorship- at Mt. Mercy

We advertise in order that the public may better
understand what the Bell System is doing, and why it-
does it. In this way we keep customers and prospective-
customers informed of our aims, policies and progress.

We advertise in order to aid the telephone customer
in making the best possible use of his service. As our
advertising inﬂuences one person after another to use
the telephone more effectively, the service rendered:
every other user is correspondingly improved.

We advertise because we have a varied service to
sell and by selling more of it we increase its value to
each user. Because of the nature of the telephone
business, it is our duty to inform the public contin-
uously of the character and varied kind of service we"

provide.

In line with this broad plan, we ﬁnd real opportunity
in addressing messages to college and university peo-
ple in their own publications, just as we also vary our
advertising for women’s magazines, farm papers and.
so on. 1934-35 is the ﬁfteenth year during which the
Bell System has published advertisements which take
college men behind the scenes of Bell Telephone

service.

Panthers Primed For Battle With Mountaineers Tomorrow

 

Sutherland May Shift Team
For Game At West Virginia

Mount, Mount, Mountaineers

Mount, Mount, Mountaineers

VVest Virginia, men of might,

Fight, team, ﬁght!

For many years that celebrated.
VVest Virginia battle cry has rung!
out over the ﬁeld when Panther met:
Mountaineer, but for ﬁve years the}
cry has been all in vain. Not since
1928 have the boys from Morgan-
town put down the Pitt boys in a
football game. This year, West Vir-
ginia is saying that things will be}
different. Beginning at 2:30 o’clock to- l
morrow, at Morgantown, there will be
an answer. ‘

Flushed over the rather handy way
in which they have disposed of West
Virginia Wesleyan and Duquesne, the
Mountaineers. under the new regime
of Coach “Trusty” Tallman, feel that
they are on the wa.y to gridiron g101‘Y
this fall. Beating Pitt will be the
greatest single step they can take in
their program.

Beating Pitt, however, will entail
the task of downing a team which is
much improved over the aggregation
which bested W & J last Saturday
and a team which is anxious to get
red-hot for a little engagement with
some gentlemen from California Sat-
urday next. Pitt’s lineup will proba-
bly be changed to allow Stan Olejnic-
zak recovered from an injury, to take
up ’a tackle post, Hub Randour, or
Leo Mala-rkey may replace Mike Nick-
sick at the left halfback position.
Karl Seiffert may likewise take Bax-
ter’s place at right end.

West Virginia will p-resent a back-
ﬁeld of Thomas at full, Allen and
Heath at the halves, and Poilek at
quarterback. The end posts will be
taken ca.re of by ‘Goodwin and Onder,
the latter a brother of Pitt’s famous
Tar On.der. Joe Stydahar and Mac-
Whinney will be the tackles, Swisher
and Vargo the guards, and the vet-
eran Stewart will be in at center.

HellingerBringsParty I
From Broadway To
Trojan Game

 

“All in a day, and all in a car,” the
New York highlights aboard the
“Broadway Special,” led by Mark
Hellinger, the famous columnist, and
his wife Gladys Glad, the noted
beauty expert and the former queen
of the late Flo Ziegfe1d’s shows, will
roar into Pittsburgh for the Panther-
Southern-California game at the Pitt
stadium on Saturday, October 13.

This special train will leave New
York on Friday and will pick up such
notables as Bert VVheeler of the stage
and screen and a member of the
famous Wheeler and Woolsey screen
team, and Lou Holtz the radio
comedian. Paul Gallico’s wife will
also be in the party; Paul, of course,
being in the press box. The idea was
sponsored by Ted Husing, the Colum-
bia sports announcer, who will cover
the game over a coast-to-coast hook-
up.

Coming out of the west for the
classic will be Joe E. Brown, the ear-
to-ear mouth star. Joe will be expect-
ed to root for the Panthers from
start to ﬁnish, Dick Powell will be
here if it is at all possible for him to
leave Hollywood. Regis Toomey, the
screen star and former Cap and
Gown star will come east with Brown,
and another of Pittsburgh’s sons of
ﬁlm fame, Vince Barnett, will also
accompany the Hollywood party.

New Pitt Women
Will Participate
In “Y” Ceremony

Traditional Lighting Of Hearth
Fire, Initiated Last Year,
Scheduled Wednesday

The House of Amicitia, nee Heinz
House, will welcome new freshman
and transfer women, and invite them
to cross its threshold to witness the
lighting of the hearth ﬁres Wednes-
day night at 7:30 o’clock. This tra-
ditional ceremony, initiated last year
by the YWCA and YWHA, symbolizes
the spirit of friendship and coopera-
tion existing among campus co-eds
and is also symbolic of the purposes
of the two organizations, the YWCA
and the YWHA, who sponsor the af-

- fair.

The Hearth ceremony, written and
directed by Thyrsa. W. Amos, dean of
women, is patterned after an old Ro-
man ceremony. For this purpose
Heinz House is transformed into the
House of Amicitia, the hearth of
which is specially decorated in cele-
bration of the lighting of the hearth
ﬁres of friendship. Carissima, the
young child who is named by Vesta,
is portrayed by a freshman woman
whose name is to remain unknown
until her appearance in the ceremony.

ner, C35, and Louise Loughner, Ed35_
Marga:-ret Chalmers, Ed36, and Adele
Ash, C35, are co-chairmen of the af-
fair.

This impressive ceremony, because
of the limited seating space, is open
only to invited guests including the
freshman women, transfers, mentors,
women of the faculty, and men of
the faculty who are interested in the
YVVCA or YWHA. They will be con-
ducted to their seats by members of
the YWCA and YWHA cabinets who
are not participating in the ceremony.
Freshmen, transfers, and mentors are
required to wear white. Freshmen
must also bring their armbands

The following committee chairmen
have been appointed to carry out the
details of the ceremony: decoration,
