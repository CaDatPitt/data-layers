BY RALPH HAURWITZ
Campus Police arrested three
Pitt students in their Towers rooms
last week in two separate incidents,
charging them with possession of
according to Police

One Tower A resident was
arrested Wednesday afternoon;
police conﬁscated a small amount
of suspected marijuana, several
water pipes, and 15 pills of

unknown identification_, I said
Graham. The student was ar-
raigned before Oakland Magistrate
Nicholas A. Diulus that afternoon
and released on nominal bond.

Two arrests were made Thursday
night in a Tower B room, where one
pound of marijuana, with a street
value of $600-800, a box of seeds,
several pipes, and 30 pills were
found, said Graham. '

The two students were taken to

Socialist Ticket Banned;
5 Gandididates Appeal

BY KEN GORMLEY

as-=,_, Candidates in the "upcoming Stu-V

”dent Government elections have

been prohibited from campaigningl
under the “Young Socialist” (YS)
banner, and ﬁve YS-connected
hopefuls are appealing the Election
Committee’s interpretation of the
Student Election Code.

The SG Election Committee ruled
last Thursday a political party is

kyaoutlawed by the Election Code if
" _ 0 the association consists of “more

than one person possessing a
generic title.” A

This new interpretation forbids
the Young Socialists from passing
out material advocating the elec-
tion of its candidates which refers
to them as Young Socialist
Candidates.

Stefﬁ Brooks, YS candidate for SG
president, considered the Election‘

'¢f"‘fr"‘Committee ruling a grossly unfair

decision, since it was made after
the campaign was already under-
way, and time and money was
already spent on campaign mater-
ials. '

“This year the rules were
changed in the middle of the
game. In the middle of the
campaign they [the Election
Committee] defined us as a
political party for the first time. We
see this as an expost facto ruling
which is discriminatory against the
Young Socialist campaign.”

Brooks added she saw nothing
wrong with political parties, but

‘V ‘I’? nevertheless the Young Socialists

have acted in good faith over the
past years inabiding by the rules

and forming no political alliances.
However, she said there were

never any objections made in
previous years to several Young

, . _ 4'S.o_cialist. candidates running on the

, same slate. v

“We se this as a [denial of our
First’ Amendment Rights. Our
freedoms of speech, press, and
association have all been violated.”
The SG presidential candidate said
the group will be consulting a
lawyer concerning the abridgement

“’i‘..of these rights.

Brooks said the Young Socialists
were especially upset ‘with the
Election Committee’s decision be-

‘ cause it prevents political issues
. from being discussed .and hampers
-the votei-"s ability to identify with
' the issues or ideology represented

in

by a slate of candidates.
She pointed out that a slate of

candidates is entirely different than ~

a political party. “We have ﬁled a
statement of ourselves as a slate.
This is a group of people running
together because of political
agreement on certain issues.”

This, Brooks said, is not a political
party because the alliance between
the candidates wo_uld “last only up
until election day and then be
dissolved.” A

Mark Satinoff, Young, Socialist

a candidate for SG Board, felt the

Election Committee’s interpreta-
tion of the Election Code was

the Jones Law Building and
arraigned before County Magi-
strate John Chandler ‘that night.
They were released on nominal
bond. -
“The Magistrate originally
wanted to post bond at $5,000

each,” said Graham, “but Detect-

ive Dennis Cavazza fought with
him and talked him into lowering it
to nominal bond.” .

Legal Awareness Committee
(LAC) member’ Kevin Joyce,
present at both the Wednesday and
Thursday arraignments, also com-
plimented Cavazza’s success in
securing nominal bond. “That
probably kept them from‘ spending
a night in jail,” said Joyce.

In both the Wednesday and
Thursday incidents‘, the arrested
students were charged with violat-

“ing the Controlled "Substance,

Dangerous Drugs, and Cosmetics

Act. The Campus Police, in both_

cases, had search warrants signed
by Magistrate Diulus. o

The Wednesday arrest, in which a
smaller quantity of suspected-
mariiuana was seized, could be a
felony or vmisdemeanor charge,
depending upon the amount of
marijuana and the - type of pills,
said Graham. “We are waiting for
the Crimes Lab’s analysis,” he

~ said. “If it’s less than 30 grams --

about one ounce, -- it’s. a
misdemeanor and would probably

Pandemonium Reigns 

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Pitt teaching assistants and fel-5

lows may be forced to unionize
separately, rather than collectively
with the faculty, if the Pitt Profes-
sional Union (PPU) accedes to a
request from it_s parent organiza-
tion, the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT).

The request, according to ex-PP_U
president Van Beck Hall, came

verbally from the AFT asking the ,

local PPU committee to “consider”

- filing a _separate petition for an

election among the graduate as-
sistants for union representation.
The PPU ﬁled the original petition
with the Pennsynvania Labor Rela-
tions Board for an election among

faculty members last,June\, which -

initiated the unionization hearings
now taking place downtown in the
State Office Building.lt is also the
only union still soliciting support
from teaching assistants and fel-
lows. '
“We haven’t got anything in
writing," Hall said yesterday.

"But the AFT apparently thinks‘

there are some problems involved

in clumping faculty and graduate"

assistants together in. the same
unit." ' ,

Hall pointed out a ‘recent court
"ruling concerning the Einstein
Hospital at Temple University

Steelers Gap 0 Superba wl   IX

BY ANDY BEHREND

Euphoria. I
S It’s Mickey Mouse, Roy Rogers
Jesus, Moses and all your basic
good guys ﬁnally paying tribute to
Art Rooney, as his bearded
wonders methodically crushed the
poor Minnesota Vikings, in Super
Bowl IX, 16-6.

The Pittsburgh Steelers can
ﬁnally laugh with the rest of the
world; they have put to rest all the

.“Same old Steeler” jokes that

ranked right up, there with Polish
gems.‘

A totally indestructible defense,
undented on the ground and barely
in the air, and an offense that ‘chose
to peak at precisely the right time,
meshed together for the Steelers,
silencing Vikings so completely
that their one score came on the
flukiest of plays.

One wondered if the game would
ever begin, as ‘King Pete Rozelle
the NFL commissioner decided to
have about 42 great American
tunes precede the national anthem
(or National Anthem, depending
how you feel about it.]

Once the Vikings’ Fred Cox did
kick off, the game was punctuated
by frequent slippages on- Tulane
Stadium’s slick turf.

Pittsburgh had to punt on their
first series, getting the blocking

but little footing as both Rocky V

Bleier and Terry Bradshaw slipped
with openings ahead. Bobby

Walden proved his veteran cagi-
ness by placingthe first of many
successful punts deep into Vikes’
territory.

_ Fran Tarkenton came out ﬁring,
but his out-of-bounds pass to John
Gilliam stalled the Vikings’ first
drive, and the totality with which

where medical interns were not
allowed to organize as employees
under Act 195 because they were
students. “Our feeling is that if
interns were not allowed to organ-

ize, then teaching assistants prob- ,

ably c_an’t either,” Hall added.

Many persons involved in the‘

unionization process yesterday in-_ ' ;"'

dicated a general trend in court

decisions which exclude students’ I‘ 

employedby a university for as-»

sistance purposes from organizin '

for collective bar‘gaining. A e

 

Jonathan Harris, PPU’s newly) _

electedpresident, said last night
the executive committee of the
group would meet Tuesday" to

discuss the AFT’s ‘recommenda-

tion. He declined further comment
pending the outcome of that meet-

ing. " 
According to Hall, the PPU’s‘, C
former president, it -is ‘possible '

teaching assistants might petition
separately, but be indicated ' the

'AFT would then have to agree to’  I
assist the graduate assistants fi-pol‘);

nancially.

When the PPU petitioned the - 
labor board last summer for air 
election, they were required by law I

to have “authorization cards” from
30%

of the members in their "; if

  

proposed bargaining unit. This__

indicates a desire among those
people to have an election where
they might choose an agent. Hall
said yesterday’ that, even without
the support of teaching assistants

and fellows, the PPU would still» ‘
hold at least 30% of the proposed)? -

group.

When news of the AFT’s request _.
became known, it was suggested _ , 7
among some teaching assistants in , I 
the PPU that they were being .

“dumped. ’ ’ Hall said. yesterday ' he

did not believe they were beingv I 
dumped, and felt the PPU would 4
not lose support of the faculty over‘ 

the matter. He did say, however‘,

there was an “outside chance’_’ the‘ _- .-
faculty would perceive the PPU as; A _
“dumping” graduate assistants, in 4. S '
which case a fall-out of support ' 

might result.

Again cautioning it was within ' if
realm of possibility, Hall said that 3 ,
if support was to evaporate, the» ’

PPU could be forced to withdraw its '
petition, thus raising questions

about the status of the labor 
‘hearings. ' '

Sidney ‘ * Lawrence, I the hearing
examiner, said the PPU could

 withdraw its_ petition, leaving the

‘hearings, only to resolve questions.  7 Y
A concerning the other two petition- V

ers--the Pitt Law Faculty Associa- . , 

tion and_the Faculty Associationfor -

the School of Medicine [other ’

parties in the hearing process are
termed “interveners”].
However, Ray Richman, president

of the local American Association.

of University Professors, said last"
night should the PPU pull out their
petition, his organization would ﬁle

Rich Gollub

Rich Gollub pledged “to mobil-
ize students around important
issues” if elected tothe SG Board;

Gollub termed ROTC “an organi-
zation which trains to kill any
person who at some time is called‘
the enemy” and said ROTC “has
no place on campus.”

He advocated a guaranteed
representation for various groups,
including blacks and women, in an"
expanded Student Government in
hopes of raising more student
interest. ' .

The SG allocations committee,
Gollub proposed, should consist of
representatives from all campus
student _ groups. He said .the

. present” allocations committee was
“not in touch with student wants.”

He opposed closed" session bar- -

, gaining between SG members and
administrators saying “if we could

_ LARRYCHABAN

Larry Chaban said he has
attended many SGB meetings‘ in
the past and has “seen the
mistakes they make.” '

Chaban said, “The Board is a
puppet of the administration” and
said he would “go and stand, up to
the administration and notJet our

I ideas‘ he put into a committee.”

His goals for the coming year, he
said, would be funding of the
Hockey team by the Athletic
Department and funding for
renovation of the Student Union. I

Chaban pledged “personal; face-
to-face” contact with students. “I
would go‘ out and talk .to the
students. People shouldn’t laugh
about student government like they
do now and they wouldn’t if we did

Dan Stiffler

Dan Stifﬂer saw a “lack of
cbmmunication between Student
Government and students” and
proposed ‘ sending agendas and
minutes from SGB meetings to all
student groups. _ I

He also complained Board mem-
bers “too often go into a situation
with deﬁnite views and don’t.go in
to look_at the other side.”

Stifﬂer criticized the- present
Board for’ “bogging thfemselves
down in the allocations procedure.

I’d like to devise a system where

‘ending sex discrimination,

     

e

the Board wouldn’t spend do much
time talking about money.”

He said he would deal with thelack
of ' student interest in Student
Government “ by showing the
students I care."

Stifﬂer said the right of the faculty
to veto appearance of class surveys
in the Undergraduate Academic
Review needed to be changed.

 

DAN STIFFLER

Biil Waddell  I

Bill Waddell outlined four planks
in; his campaign platform. They
wérezforming a more democratic
Student Government, achieving
black control of black studies,
and
‘denying credit for ROTC courses.

.“The SGB sould be expanded to
have more than seven representa-

  
 
 
 
 
 
   

tives,”, he said. Waddell also He proposed attendarioe, of:  A

proposed representation of all

major student factions on the

Board. v
Concerning black studies, he said,

“theadministration has no right to

determine the course ' of black
studies. Black students ‘and faculty
should have complete controlover
policy, curriculum, and hiring and
ﬁring.” - .
Wadd’ell pioposed more child-care

centers to assist female students,

and faculty with children.

M He also ‘suggested students‘ .
should get first choice of tickets for -

Pitt‘ athletic events. \

The saddest part of a student government board such as the present
one is that it perpetuates itself. Freshman whose only knowledge with
student government rests on the present administration will feel little

desire to vote at the January 22nd elections, and even less to get
actively involved with Student Government.

 

Any comment on the Board as a whole is inevitably somewhat unfair,
since the effort put out by -the members was so diverse. Two Board
members, Bruce Keeler and Paul Hertneky, stand out although to
varying degrees. Keeler took an active part in almost all SG activities
of the Board, and was the ﬁrst to recognize students’ interest in
maintaining the operations of the Arsenal Family and Children’s .
Center. Hertneky was most active in negotiations surrounding the SU
Annex and the formation of the Pennsylvania Student Lobby. Because
Keeler and Hertneky are currently SGB presidential candidates, we
will discuss their records and qualiﬁcations in a future editorial.

The best that can be said of Board member Nguyen Thi Kim Loan is

that her attendance record at Board meetings was exemplary. That,

Weinbrom. Their involvement in Student Government has been of a
peripheral nature, showing a complete lack of interest or ability.

Perhapsthe best conclusion to be drawn from this year’s Board, is
that they can serve as a model for future Boar --a model of mistakes
‘and insensitivity to the students they were elected to represent.

 

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

What this country, in the midst of
internal strife and inﬂation, needs
more than anything else is unity.

The policies of Gerald Ford as
president have made an heroic
attempt in this direction, but have
come up against an immovable wall

. of stubbornness and greed.

It is up to the leaders of this
nation, then, to find a new method,
a new course, which will unite this

  

 

country and bring us home safe and .

sound. «
One method, overlooked for some-
time, but historically recognized as
a viable alternative, and remark-
ably successful is that of the
program. a
Pogroms united countries as badly
I divided as Ancient Rome and
' Egypt, Germany and France and
even Russia. The pogrom would
offer a safe, well-controlled means
for the unleashing of the anxiety
and frustration building towards
an explosion in this nation.
The only question remaining is
just whom do we choose?
I( Rhode Island: How many times

times did you fail a history test
because it was so small you didn’t
see it on the wall-map? A

The concensus of people every-
where is that Rhode Island is good
for nothing. It’s basic industry is
providing a bedrock for highways
carrying traffic from New York to
Connecticut, the population is“ gen-
erally cranky, the air fetid, the
water brackish. Altogether, a
hateful place. Why not crush it? A
united effort to pave Rhode Island
over, to annihilate its sly and
unscrupulous citizens could put
punch behind Gerald Ford’s policy
of reconcilation.

Obviously this a group of human
beings we would be better off
without, and the sooner the better.

There is a concerted conspiracy of
compliance among people who
quit smoking to live longer. This
means they will go on eating,
burning gasoline and producing
children long after the average
American patriotically succumbs to

lung cancer. These greedy, self- -
seeking individuals intend nothing‘

Student Trustee

Explains Positions

Dear Editor:

Although I appreciated the op-
portunity to voice my opinions and
expectations about my recent ap-
pointment to the Board of Trustees
in you article, “S.G.S. Students
Joins Trustees” (January 10,
1975), I am concerned about a
particular quote which was attri-
buted to me.

To have said that the other Board
members, particularly politicans,
do not feel ‘strongly that the
concems of the consumer group of
the University should be part of
their responsibility would have
been foolish and presumptuous.
What I did, in fact, way was that
some Board members, many‘ of
-whom come from professions in
law, business and politics, bring
their expertise to the group without
the beneﬁt of student experience
and that I see my role as providing
that experience. A

I think the fact that Governor

Shapp, who is an ex officio member ,

of the Board of Trustees, has made
this appointment because young
people can provide view points,

which may not be recognized, lends ‘

credence to the fact that student

attitudes are considered an asset to»

the work of the Board. It is an
entrustment that Ishall take very
seriously during the next four

‘ years.

In Support of
Men's Studies
Dear Editor,

Mr. Hooper’s letter (Jan. 8th) was

a bit extreme, but he did make

some good points. .

Women's study courses which are

crowding out genuine ‘academic »

subjects in universities today
should either be relegated intel-

lectually to the status. of basketg.-ﬁg, 

weaving, or accompanied by
_courses in men’s studies.

These latter could tell men how
they can be thrown into prison for
not paying 100% child support.
Even worse, they could explain that
even if they do pay, they have
nothing to say about the child's
upbringing. How they can’t even
demand he be kept around so they

. can visit him.

Maybe if more of the feminists
went to work on this last item,
people would take. their talk of fair

- play seriously.

Sincerely,
Paul Frederick

_ be disposed of at the Magistrate
.~ level.”
The Thursday arrests, in which a
 ‘pound of marijuana was found, are
“felony charges, said Graham. A.
preliminary hearing is scheduled‘
 for today before Magistrate, Diulus.
 Last week’s arrests have prompt-
 ed speculation the Campus Police
5., ‘are “cracking down” on drugs at
} Pitt. “The lesson of these busts is
that marijuana is against the law
and the Campus Police are
enforcing it, said Joyce.
-_ “In my opinion, this is the
ET" " beginning; I think we’ll see more
I . busts in the next few months. The
motive of the Campus Police is to
‘T:-I ~ clean up the drug scene and the
' 1 related crime at Pitt.
_ _ f‘So‘ what we’re saying," contin-
7- ued Joyce, “is yes, the Campus
Police’ "are making busts. They’re
not just here to protect students,
- they are involved in this action, too.
- ' If they have information, they’re
going to act on it; they won’t throw
 I1 ‘ "it away‘. So ifa person's dealing, he
' shouldn’t feel too safe. I’m
‘concerned with making students
I aware of this.
' ' “Most of our experience in this
area has been with drug arrests by
the city and county police agen-
cies,” said Joyce. “Busts by the

  

 

   
 

Charged

Campus Police are new for us.”
Graham said, however, in an
interview with the Pitt News

‘yesterday, drug arrests by the

Campus Police are nothing new.
“As a Campus Police detective I
made 40 narcotics arrests in one
year myself.”

Graham said there has been no
change in his department's policy
and priorities concerning narcotics
on campus.

“Three arrests do not make a new
policy,” he said. “We got
information on a substantial
amount of narcotics activity and we
acted on it. I see no more busts in
the immediate future. But if we
ﬁnd out about narcotics activity or
receive information, we have to act
on it. That’s our job. If we ignored
it, we would be breaking the law.

‘ ‘We’re not interested in snooping
around after every ounce of
marijuana on campus,” continued
Graham. “But if there is dealing,
where large amounts are handled
and sold, if we don’t deal with it,
some other police ageii’cy, like the
City or the County, will."

“And they aren’t as sympathetic
toward students as we are. At the
Thursday night arraignment, Ca-
vazza really fought with the
Magistrate to get nominal bond.
He personally guaranteed that the
students would appear at the

.  5   

  in Busts  

  

hearing. A county police officer
would never do that.

‘‘I hope that students trust that
their best interests are our concern.
That’s why we don’t use their
names.

marijuana is the criminal associa- .

tions you have to make to get it.

This compromises you and puts you "

in danger.

“We used to have a large armed I

robbery problem in the Towers,
where people who were dealing
would be robbed at gunpoint,” said
Graham. “Once, the roommate of
someone who was dealing was tied

to a chair and pistol"-‘whipped. This
‘is the big problem with dealing _

drugs; it puts many people in
danger. And these armed robberies
were happening on a regular basis

.-in the Towers.
A “We won’t raid if students don’t

deal,” said Graham. “lt’s that
simple.”

Tom Doman, Chairman of the
LAC, had similar advice for

students. "Be cool and clean up .

your act,” he said. “The police are
trying to help. They don’t want
anyone to’get hurt.

“They're just trying to make it .
easier for everyone. And they’re »

also trying _ to keep the County
Police out, who aren’t as sympa-
thetic to students as the Campus
Police.”

car, covered with posters and a
road atlas. Shoes _are on the ﬂoor.
Jon, a mime, looks in the rear

traces of make-up from his face.
Trips like the one from his New

where he performed at the Frick

are made in one day. The tiny
green Saab has over 100,000 miles

,__l‘Litt|e Prince" in Review

=~(

BY M. C. PILECKI

Surprisingly, it has taken An-
toine de Saint Exupery’s classic
children’s novel The Little Prince
several decades to make it to the

celluloid. And none too soon.
Without going.’ into all those
ivory-tower discussions of philoso-
phy, etc., in which one is usually
entrapped when speaking of The
Little Prince be assured that the
ﬁlm‘ version retains the original
ﬂavor of the wisdom of innocence
and the folly of the “grown-ups,”
despite occasionjal hokum. Lauda-

“bly, the film avoids the stickiness

and cuteness usually associated
with the G (for Gooey)’ rating.
Actually (as most scholars will tell
you), The Little Prince isn’t
“really” for children, but rather a
moral satire cloaked in childish

grins, that raps wealth; govern-.

ment, scholar, the military, and
other sacred cows of society, while

‘setting forth a seemingly simple

philosophy of love, responsibility
and happiness. -

Gene Wilder as The Fox peeps-out

from his hideout in Stanley
Donen’s ﬁlm of .Lerner and Loewe’s
The Little Prince.

For some reason the story was
made into a musical. Sometimes
‘the music ﬁts in quite well, but all
too often [especially at the

beginning], the songs have the‘

faked, lstagey look that all musicals
are built upon and" which seems

totally out of place in a work like ,

The Little Prince.

In case you ever missed reading
the book, the story concerns a pilot
(Richard Kiley) who, after discus-
sing a frustrated childhood,
crashes into the Sahara. There he
meets a strange but wonderful (and

therefore normal) little boy, the‘

 -Prince (a beautifullycoifed Stephen

Warner), who tells him of life on
his own tiny planet and of his
journey that brought him to this

desert. The special effects are (as j
special effects go) quite average 

but wonderfully used for a special

effect. Needless to say, the ﬁlm is
ﬁlled with deep meanings and
philosophical innuendoes, without
getting too dull about ‘it.
Although, as’ mentioned before,
_t_he songs , usually seem" out_ of

Harvey:  Mime’ Insight

referring to his education with.

teachers including Marcel Mar-

ceau. “There are special exercises »

for your face and fingers. I also do
push ups and jog in good
weather.”

In pieces ‘ranging from In
Memoriam a series of images
performed to John Lennon’s God to
the more conventional Knife
Thrower, Jon uses mime to express
his unique view of life. His work
reﬂects his feelings; however, Jon
says that some pieces dealing with

pain and suffering make “state-

ments which are beyond me.”

Many of Jon’s serious pieces
concern life in the city. Riding the
subway. Narcissistic guys slicking
their hair back in the men’s room.
More abstract routines like The
Wall and No Exit evoke the
conﬁnement and fear of being shut
in typical of cities.

f‘Maybe I should have done some

pieces about working in the steel 

‘ mills. I could have called it iron

mime.” _ .

Jon became interested in mime a
dozen years ago. “While I was at
Columbia,” he says, “I took a
mime course atthe New School for
Social Research. .After that I left
Columbia.’.’ ‘ '

Besides appearing for sponstirs
like the Pittsburgh 99 Cent Floating
Theatre Festival, Jon was the first
mime to perform at the Museum of
Modern Art. A short film based on
one of. his pieces .won a Bronze
medal at the New York Film
Festival.

The 12 “years of work and_ the
mileage on the Saab have their
rewards.

Jon stands backstage at the Frick

BY STEVE SYBERT

Displaying their most devastating
attack on the season, the Pitt
Hockey Club proved to be no match
Penn State-McKeesport in
crushing the hapless Saints, 11-1,
at the Civic Arena on Saturday.

Three Panther skaters turned in .

"hat tricks to spark the victory, the

team’s seventh of the season. '
Rick Vernon rammed home four
goals to raise his total to 16 with
Chuck Crisanti and Jeff Suanders
contributing three goals apiece.

' Bob Arturo’s single tally‘ was the

other goal. .

Pitt jumped out to a 4-0 first
period lead. to begin the rout.~ At
the: 5:48 mark, Saunders took

Vernon’s pass from behind the net
and slid the puck under the Saints
goaltender,\Doug Zibrat. _ Arturo
followed aminute later with a 30-
footer which found its way through
a crowd and into the net.

With 12:09 gone, Saunders ﬂip-
ped a close-in shot into a swarm of
players. Zibrat never.saw the puck
which ended up behind him.

I Vernon blasted in a slap shot with

seven seconds remaining to close

. out the opening period attack.

The Panthers added two goals in
the second period to increase the
margin to six. Vernen made an
unassisted rush and ‘even with a
Penn State defenseman on his back
still managed to score at the 3:53

BY RICK STOUFFER
Associate Sports Editor

Many times at the beginning of
the season a coach will try to make
an excuse for his team’s poor
showing "saying “it’s the ﬁrst
meet” or “we weren’t prepared for
the tough competition.”

Don’t look to track coach Jim
Banner for any justification for a
poor showing. He doesn't need
any.

The reason being the two mile
relay team took on the best in the
country at-Maryland's CYO Invita-
tional and merely showed them Pitt
can play with the big boys, too.

~ The relayers placed third in the

prestigious event with a time of
7:40.

Being lumped in the same class
with the likes of powerhouses
Nebraska, Villanova,..a.nd Florida is
about as enviable as being caught
in Friday’s rush hour traffic. But
ﬁnishing only six seconds behind
ﬁrst place ﬁnisher Villanova just

' “ain’t bad.”

‘‘l was very pleased with the
runners’ times,” said Coach

Banner. “When we went to the’

event I‘ had hoped for a ﬁnish of

'7:40 so they deﬁnitely ran as I had '

wanted. ”

The trackstersjwere mixing with 1'

the elite of the track world at
Maryland. Since track clubs are
allowed to compete with collegiates
at the CYO all the top performers
were in attendance. '

The Paciﬁc Coast Club, a loosely
grouped band of stars including Al
Feurbach, known for throwing a
shotput like some people-throw a
baseball, and Maurice Peoples
gave the large crowd a thrill
whenever they came on the track.

The long hours of practice payed
off for the relayers [Ed Totin, Don’
Betterley, Chuck Mozingo, and
Rich Markley] as they are now in

the top five for the two mile relay in , 

the country. .

‘ ‘We looked very good for an early
meet,” said Banner. “But better
times are deﬁnitely going to come.
We’re coming along slowly.”

If coming along slowly means
finishing third in a meet against the-.
‘best there is, maybe even slower

development would be even better. ‘

The entire track team will be
showing off their skills this Friday
night when they take on the Kent ,
State Golden Flashes at the
Fieldhouse. Last year the Panthers
.blew- the State team off the track
thoroughly dominating in every
event and a repeat performance
could be in order. '8. I ’

 

mark. Eight minutes later, Crisanti
drove a low shot by Zibrat for the
first of hisgoals.

Panther goaltender Johnny De-
Fazio lost his bid for a shutout, but
Pitt knocked in ﬁve more goals in
third period action.

DeFazio made a great save on
Mark Manovich’s point blank shot,
but Saint captain John Davis
grabbed the rebound and sent the
puck_by the Pitt netminder. '

With 5:13 gone in the final stanza,
Crisanti slid one by Zibrat to revive
the Pitt- attack. Three minutes
later, Vernon took a pass from Paul
Fischione at the blue line, skated
around the Penn State defenseman
deked twice and ﬂipped the puck
into the net. '

Leading 8-1 with four minutes
remaining, the Panthers would not
relent. Crisanti matched Vernon's
hat trick effort by sending a shot
through a maze of jostling players
and by Zibrat at the 11:08 mark. ~

Only 35 seconds later, _Vernon
blasted a slap shot from the right
point into the cage for his fourth
goal of the game. Saunders scored
with 11 seconds remaining to
obtain his hat trick and further
embarrass the lowly Saints.

The Panthers outshot Penn State

54-12, another indication of the’

mismatch that took place. The 0-4
Saints have now. been outscored
38-9. Pitt, now 2-0 in league
competition, will return to action
Sunday afternoon versus Duquesne
‘at the Civic Arena.

Oakland game permeated through
alot of minds: Pittsburgh can ‘move
the ball butwill they score?
Again, as Minnesota took over,
Tarkenton and Co. w&? harassed
by the swarming Steel Curtain. No
matter how many times you hear
that tired old cliche: “the game
was won in the trenches,” it'll be
correct.- Joe Greene, L.C.
Greenwood, Ernie Holmes and
Dwight (back from the dead) White
never ceased to pressure Tarken-
ton, while the Steelers’ offensive
line continuously blew out the
Purple Gang, springing Harris and
Bleier all day. -
Pittsburgh took, over after stil
another Eischeid punt from their
own 47. Franco, following the
Rock, carried down to the 29. Terry
B. then countered with a mysti-
fying bootleg, gaining 11, where
again the drive was clogged. This
time Gerela didn’t' even get to kick,

"as Walden couldn’t handle the

snap. He was thrown for ‘a loss,
and Minnesota, inept thusfar, was
still in a scoreless tie as the 1st
Quarter ended.

Each team was unsuccessful on
offense the next time around, but
the Vikes received the game’s, ﬁrst

turnover when Bleier, after break- .

ing loose, coughed up the ball to
rookie Randy Poltl, who recovered -
on the Steeler 24.

Faced with their ﬁrst real test, the
Big D held fast, and kept -the tie
going as Cox’ ﬁeld goal try was
wide by a couple lengths of a
football.

On their next drive, Bradshaw
drilled a pass to John Stallworth
good for 22 yards, but on third and?’
one, Bleier was rocked by Jeff
Siemon: Walden again shone,
however, punting to _the Viking
seven. _- s

After Chuck Foreman, Minne-

' sota’s superstar, gained two yards,

Tarkenton botched up a pitch back

[to Dave Osborn. The ball bounced

off Osborn, then caromed off
charging L.C. Greenwood back
toward the end zone. There, Tark
fell on the ball, Dwight White fell,

_on him, and Pittsburgh had the

ﬁrst points of the game on a safety,
to lead 2-0. '0

Late in the second quarter, the
Vikes had a rare sustained drive,
moving down to the Steelers’ 21 on
the strength of a great juggling
reception by Foreman.

On 1st and 10, Tarkenton
completed a pass to Gilliam ‘over
the middle at the 5. He wasjmet
rudely by the two ﬂying elbows of
Steeler Safety Glen Edwards, and
fumbled the ball skywardwhere
the Steelers’ Mel Blount gobbled it
up and came outto the Viking 10
yard-line. '

From there Bradshaw ran out the
clock, protecting the 2-0 lead.

Brown couldn’t handle. Marv

Kellum, one of a plethora of .'

valuable Steeler rookies, landed on
the ball at Minnesota’s 30. '

After Bleier was stopped on ﬁrst
down, Jim Clack opened up a huge

lane freeing Harris to the 7. Two ’ 81
plays later, ‘Franco, led'by Gerry "

Mullins, outraced two Vikes to the

leftside of the end zone for a 9 yard " 
Gerela added the extra , 5

point, and it was 9-0.
The teams traded punts, and so

frustrated was Tarkenton that he 

had a pass blocked (he had four

blocked all afternoon) and it came V 
right back in his face. Later in the ‘
same series, Greenwood partially  "

blocked a pass that Joe Greene

garnered for the Steelers’ second ' if

interception. The third quarter
ended as Harris took the ball into

Vike territory, the Steelers hanging ‘ I,

on to a precarious nine point lead.

That drive froze, and as Tarkenton, .
prepared his team for the fourth _

quarter, ‘he may have been

Then came the play which bit a 8

chunk out of Steeler fans’ hearts.,
Walden hadhis punt blocked by
Matt Blair, and Terry
recovered in the end zone for the

Vikes’ only points of the day, as _.j

Cox had the PAT blocked.

The Steelers got an unexpected
break from the officials (the

“zebras” called seven penalties for '

107 yards against Pittsburgh, while
Minnesota was whistled down for
only three for 18) when Bradshaw
hit Larry» Brown down to the Vike

28. Brown fumbled there, but the K j
referree ruled it was after. the

under the boards, grabbing 36
rebounds t9,.just 22 for the Cats,’
and while the Bisons outshot Pitt
56% to 42%, the game was won in
the rebound department.

The Bisons played admirably,
grabbing a 36-35 lead at halftime,
after having trailed for most of the
ﬁrst half. The second half was a

rugged struggle for both _teams_.,

4:50.68 setting a new team record.

Pitt captured all of the 16 possible
diving competition points. Leading
the sweep of the one meter diving
competition_was Jeff Miller, whose
score of 279 points left him one
point shy of V qualifying for the

— national diving championship later

this year. Dave Reeder, who
ﬁnished first in the three meter
diving, placed second.

“We’re on schedule right now,"
said diving coach Al Coffey. “I was

On the other hand, Hall said if

Bucknell was extremely physical

“No,” Velvano said, “we really
didn’t expect to beat Pitt.” But it
seems we always play overvour
heads against Pitt and Penn State
(whom Bucknell lost to in overtime
at State College).

Playing with .more conﬁdence

players after the game, and they
had to be asking themselves one
question: Why did we lose?

Keith Starr, who co-captured high
scoring honors with Kirk Bruce,
both scoring 17 points, said that
“Rebounding, rebounding” was
the Panthers’ main difficulty.
“Their guards hit good from the
outside,” Starr also mentioned.

Tom Richards, who connected on
six of 13 field goals, placed part of
the blame on himself.

“We’re coming close, but I think
we have to get the ball into the big
men more than what we have been.
That might be my fault.”

Head coach Buzz Ridl, of course,
was a dejected man following the
Panther’s seventh loss of the

5638011, and pointed out several

factorsfor the Panther’s,la’pse.

. “We didn’t get the -rebounds,”
Ridl noted. “Their shooting was‘

excellent. We have to win away

.from home. We have som_e new

players‘ going ,in- (Ralph Mc-
Clelland, Larry Harris, Bennett)

‘and this might have something to

A do with it. Andalso, our shooting

l

has to be about 46 percent.”

  navy m....... -...»e 

BY G.W. STEVENS
Sports Editor _

Before Pitt’s wrestling match with
Navy, Pitt coach Dave Adams
stated that this could be the
Panther’s year to top the Mids.

in Fitzgerald Fieldhouse and once
again the Navy was victorious by an
overwhelming 33-6 score.

But the match was somewhat
closer than the score indicated as

the.Mids prevailed in several key“

matches primarily because of their
superior conditioning. The Pitt

wrestler jumped out to an early .

lead in nearly every match only to
wind up shortin the end.
The match started as expected.

The Cats needed wins from their A

lighweights to offset the powerful
Mids in the later matches. Kevin
Nellie did his job at 118 pound

hadn’t lost in two prior matches.
Nellie completely dominated Cos-
tello who could manage just two
escapes in the 10-2’ decision.
George Bryant started strong in

the next match jumping out a 5-0 '

lead over his Navylopponent. But
‘in the third period Mike Beck
reversed Bryant and caught him on
his back. Bryant made a great
effort just avoiding the pin but time
ran out with Beck on ,top 7-5\.
Two undefeated wrestlers were
paired in the 134- pound class.
Rande Stottlemyer went to the

mats for Pitt with at win in his first

-..

’,~—=~.f_,’match. Tom Bauer, who was 2-0,

was up for the Mids; The match
was uneventful with Stottlemyer
gaining the opening takedown and
then battling to maintain the 2-0
decision, and a 6-3 team lead for

Zdefeating Mark Costello ‘who \

the Panthers.

At 142 pounds, Bob Bailey of Pitt
met Jeff Steiner. Bailey was no
match for the Middie who com-
pletely dominated the match until
finally catching the Pitt wrestler on

‘his back at 1:40 of the ﬁnal period.

Perhaps it was the Panthers’ lack
of meets so far this season or the
fact that Navy had already wrestled

~ eleven successful matches but the

Cats seem to die near the end of
every match while the Mids were
still going strong. -

Skip Bolin fell to the same fate in
his match with highly-rated Dan
Muthler. Bolin led early in the
match but the Mid wore him down

‘ history.

riding the Pitt wrestler through the
entire period to cop the 6-4
decision.

Roger Fleischer went to the mat
for Navy in the 167 class against
John “Bimbo” Chapman, one of
the winningest wrestlers in Pitt
Chapman started strong
but Fleischer ﬁnished stronger
raising his record to 6-0 with a third
period pin giving Navy assurance
of a least a tie with a 21-6 lead.

Bill Bailey also turned in a
“almost” performance for Pitt
against Ken Goodrow._ The match
see-sawed with Bailey going in
front in the -first period and then

finding himself behind at the end of_

the second. Bailey made ‘a super

effort gaining a reverse to knot the
score at 5-5, but he couldn’t_ hold
Goodrow down and the Mid scored
an escape to grab the decision.
Jeff Minerd returned to action in
the 190 pound class but he didh’t
last through the second period
against Jeff Simons who is now
undefeated in eight matches.
Minerd suffered a shoulder injury
in the second frame and Simons
was awarded the win" by default.
The Middies have dropped just
one bout in the ﬁnal two classes so
far this season and Pitt’s Carl Roba
wasn’t_ able to change a/thing in the
Heavyweight contest. Mark Step-

  

   
  
  
 
 

anovich took Roba through three.
‘periods, wearing him down and
ﬁnally scoring four points ,in the
ﬁnal period for the 4-1 decision and’

The Panthers are now 1-1 in dual ~
