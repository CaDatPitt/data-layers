World's hunger problems
measured in termsof IMR

By Adam Eisenstat
, Staff Writer
Although there are over one bil-

lion hungry people in the world, the
resources and technology to end

hunger do exist. That was the princi-’

pal message delivered by moderator
Jeff Bonar at an Ending Hunger
Briefing of The Hunger Project held
on campus last Wednesday.

The Hunger Project is a predomi-
nantly volunteer-staffed, interna-
tional, nonprofit, charitable
organization with about 2.85 million
members. It was established in San
Francisco in 1977; co-founder
Werner Erhard, a member of its
Board of Directors, also founded the
Erhard Seminars Training, better
known as est.

The goal of The Hunger Project,
Bonar said, is -to educate people
about both the facts of world hunger
and what they, as individuals, can do

I . to end hunger once and for all.

, Using slides, maps and charts,
Bonar, a computer science professor
in Pitt's Learning Research and
Development Center, presented the
world hunger picture in great detail.

There are five basic types of
hunger, he said. The most common
form, from which over 60 percent of

_ the world's hungry suffer, is chronic

undernutrition, in which people do
not get enough food on a day-to-day
basis.

Malnutrition, another form of
hunger, occurs when a speciﬁc nutri-
ent is lacking in one‘s diet. The most
dramatic example of this, Bonar
said,‘ is vitamin A deficiency, which
blinds over 200,000 children a year.

Malabsorption hunger is caused
by parasites who consume many of
the nutrients in one‘s food. He said
this is often a result of poor
sanitation.

Seasonal hunger occurs periodi-
cally, Bonar said, often before a
harvest, when storage facilities for
food a're insufficient or inadequate,

in which case insects devour the
food.

. The least common form ofhunger

is famine, which affects large areas
and generally, follows a major

trauma such as drought, ﬂood or’

war, he explained. .

According to Bonar, 1-4 to 18 mil-
lion people die each year from
hunger. Two months ago, he said,
the figure was closer to 15 to 20 mil-
lion. At’ the current rate of progress,
he said, death by starvation could be
wiped out by 2050. “I’m not satisfied
with that,” said Bonar, who believes
more can be done to end hunger
sooner;

The chief method of measuring
hunger in societies at large is with
the infant mortality rate (IMR),
Bonar said. The IMR indicates how
many infants under a year old die for

every 1,000 born. Countries with

lMRs of 50 or more are considered
to be having a real hunger problem,
he said. Some key countries and
their rates are the United States,
11.4; the Soviet Union, 33; India,
122; and Nigeria, 134.

Bonar spent a good deal of time
discussing the significance of the
IMR and said IMR awareness was
the focus of the briefing. He said the
IMR reflects overall conditions,
including the nutritional state of
mothers.

Each of the 15 persons in attend-
ance at the briefing in Mervis Hall
was given a chart listing every coun-
try in the world and their vital popu-
lation statistics, including IMR,

-growth rate and life expectancy.

Bonar pointed-out that the IM R and
growth rate of a country are inex-
tricably linked.

Countries with a high IM R have a
relatively large growth rate because,
when parents know that a large per-
centage of their children will not sur-
vive, they will have larger families to
ensure that they will have enough
ﬁeld hands or laborers and that. ulti-
mately, a son or sons will live to care

for them in'their old age.

Africa is the,continent with the
worst hunger problems, and it is the
only part of the world where the
situation is worsening. The Mideast,
whose great oil wealth is concen-
trated in the hands ofa few, also has
a hunger problem, but it is improv-
ing. According to Bonar, if Indone-
sia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and

Nigeria — in which 25 percent of the _
‘ African population lives -— solved

their hunger problems, half of the
hunger in the world would be
eliminated. 4 I

Bonar cited China, which has a
population that is almost one-
quarter of the world’s total, as a
major success story in. the battle
against hunger. “You don't hear
mothers saying, ‘Clean your plate
and think of the starving people in
China’ because there isn’t a problem
there anymore.”

Other success stories include
Cuba, which dropped its IMR 90
points in 20 years, and the Soviet
Union, whose IMR dropped 150
points in 20 years.

The bottom line to the hunger
problem is, of course, food — and
Bonar said there is plenty ofit. Food
production hasyboubled in the last
production has doubled in the last
alone, one and a half million metric
tons, to feed seven billion people two
loaves of bread per day for a whole
year, he said.

Bonar said The Hunger Project
firmly believes each society has the
capacity to become self-sufficient
and to end hunger in a way that best
works for itself.

“Ultimately,” Bonar said, “the
hungry and poor will be the ones to
turn it around. It will take courage,
but that's something they don't
lack.“

“The end of hunger is an idea
whose time has come," Bonar said,
echoing the motto of The Hunger
Project. “What it takes is individu-
als’ being committed.”

Black rate sky—high 

By Megan McGough
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh’s 15-year standing as
the American city with the highest
black infant mortality rate moved

medical and social work experts to’

call for community action at an all-
day conference held on the Pitt cam-
pus last Thursday.

Sponsored by the Greater Pitts-

‘burgh March of Dimes and the

Urban League of Pittsburgh, “Black
Infant
Action” attempted to determine the
specific causes for Pittsburgh’s dis-
tressingly high black infant mortal-
ity rate. r

Locally, black infants die at a rate
almost three times higher than that
of white infants,‘accordin_g to an
April 1984 report of the Pittsburgh
Black Women's Health Network. In
1982, Pittsburgh’s black infant mor-
tality rate was 29.9 for every 1,000
live births, while the rate for white
infants was 10.7 per 1,000.

Speakers at the conference, which
was held in David Lawrence Hall
and at the Graduate School of Pub-
lic Health, attributed the high
number of black infant deaths to
adolescent pregnancy, poor nutri-
tion and a lack of adequate medical
care.

“When dealing with this tragic

problem, we need to talk about
social and cultural factors first,” said _

Mary Hughs, vice-president for
public health education of the
March of Dimes and one of the con-
ference's keynote speakers. Poverty
is a factor that cannot be ignored,
according to Hughs. If apregnant
black girl is suffering from undernu-
trition as a result of her socio-
economic circumstances, “her baby
is automatically at a disadvantage,"
she said.

Hughs stressed that, in order to
reduce significantly the rate of black
infant mortality, action must .be
taken to ‘prevent young black
women from giving birth. In 1980,
9.5 percent of American black

females aged 15-19 gave birth,
according to a l980National Urban
League report. Contraceptive pro-
grams, assertiveness training for
young women in impoverished areas
and radio broadcasting informing
young women of the social services
available to them can be part of a
community effort to decrease teen-
age pregnancy, said Hughs.

‘‘In 1982, one of every two welfare
families was headed by a teen
mother. If the institutionalization of
young female poverty continues, by
1990, two of every three welfare fam-
ilies will be headed by teen mothers,”
she said.

Teenage mothers, who are often
physically underdeveloped, tend to
give birth prematurely, resulting in
low-weight babies, said Nigel
Paneth, assistant professor of public
health and pediatrics at Columbia
University. 1»

“In 1981, 60 percent of low birth-_
weight babies [under two pounds]
died in the first month," Paneth said.
Inadequate prenatal medical atten-
tion often results in low-weight
births.

Marian Edelman, president ofthe
Defense Fund, stated
“Black babies are more likely to die
because black mothers are more
likely to be poor and simply cannot
‘afford the prenatal care that would
help solve the problem.”

In closing, Paneth urged the
audience to realize that the problem
of black infant mortality is “an indi-
cator of larger socio-economic prob-
Iems and inequalities."

As the Pittsburgh Black Women’s
Health Network pointed out inpits
1984 publication Saving Our Babies,

“Young black mothers must cope

£3

with a cycle of poverty that predis- _

poses them to illness long before
they become pregnant. They have

little — if any —— money to purchase . ~t

health care, and they are more likely
than their white counterparts to
exist in an environment character-
ized by overcrowding, substandard
housing, poor sanitation and inade-
quate nutrition.”

Hazard’s corner/Jomes M. Crary

Provost predicts
a changing tide

is the university sinking? Not yet,
but when a center of culture and
academic life is seen manning the
oars to catch up with the breeze
rather than raising the sail to joy-
ride through change, then it’s a sure
sign that something’s mis-anchored.
Without a little navigation, we’ll all
be clinging to stones and driftwood
before long. (Maybe 1’d betterthrow
this sea metaphor overboard before
it’s forced to walk the plank.)

A fresh breeze is to be felt in last
month’s Faculty Newsletter from
the provost on planning for the
future; fresh, that is, but unsure ofits
direction.

The university has been asked to
plan for the future. That this should
have to be requested is a sign of dec-
adence, but perhaps the pressure
and intrusion of common sense will
work, with the help of a healthy
budget pinch. Sometimes, we all like
to wait until the last minute; and so
now it isjust that —— the last minute
(or maybe two). '

The best thing in the provost’s let-
ter is the request “to move beyond
the model of the student as a passive
receptacle.” That such a model ever
could have existed is appalling, of
course, but it never hurts to hear
something encouraging, like this

new theory that a university should
nuture curiosity rather than foster
conformity.

A big issue this university must
face is indeed its aim in the new era,
which the provost, like Alvin
Toffler, mistakenly calls “post-
industrial,” a point to which I will
return. Will the university become
nothing but a‘ tool for corporate
training, putting scholarly pursuits
in the brig? Or will we encourage a
moral stand, worthy of man, such as
working for the preservation of life
on this planet, beyond such a narrow
field of vision as a simple career for
oneself‘? Will we tolerate the contem-
plative and inefficient side of man
and the right to non-participation?
What level of impracticality will ‘we

It is my hunch that some level of
slack and inefficiency is not only
inevitable but ideal. On a philoso-
phical level, much talk is heard these
days about the evil of the “welfare
state.” The news is that man did not
invent the welfare state; the welfare
state invented man. Has anyone ever
received a tax form from God for the
air we breathe?

While the military in America
complains about a few billion dol-
lars lopped from the head ofits eco-
nomic hydra, it is sobering to note

Now, back to the point about a
“post-industrial” society. There is a
change in industry, but it has been
misinterpreted. The function of
industry was warped during the
Industrial Age by a misunderstand-
ing of the nature of material wealth
and profit. The reason for this mis-
understanding lies somewhere

In Ayn Rand‘s work greed is the
ultimate ideal; in Stalin‘s. it is self-

thing worthwhile, however, it must
be selfish because we are only
human, but an element ofgenerosity
is so much a part of human integrity
that it, too, is inevitable. Generosity
is also the natureof the planet.

So industry devoured the ecos-
phere in the name of greed or self-

nature, we see industry slow and
appear to stagnate. It is not obsolete
and never will be. It is changing
toward more appropriate levels of
ecomony. The behemoth of the
U.S.-U.S.S.R. military conspiracy
looms large, and its sirens wail, but
it, too, is but a legacy. The future will
not reflect this belligerence.

The realvquestion for the faculty is
whether this university will fulfill its
obligation to remain a refuge and
forum in the pursuit of conscience,
freedom and truth. Remember,
we’re all in the same boat.

Me” or the hopelessly adolescent
reminiscences of “Bobby Jean,”
for the most part, it doesn’t seem
to matter. The power of Spring-
steen is such that a song which
rightly belongs on thejunk heap
is quickly forgotten for the next
which may prove as indelible as,
say, “For You” or “She’S the
One.”

“Improvement makes straight
roads,” William Blake wrote,
“but, the crooked roads without
improvement are roads of
genius.” Though a certain artis-
tic fastidiousness has made the
path of Bruce Springsteen’s
genius anything but a straight
road over the past 12 years, it

continues to be one well worth /

Home cooking in the Village

By Jeffrey Sewald
Staff Writer

“ ‘The Nose’ shines his own
shoes; that’s no big success.”
Such is street—bred Paulie’s opin-
ion of a relative’s “clea'n" living
in this marvelously scaled-down
variation ona familiar tale —— the
little man’s desire for a cut of the
big shot’s pie.

We’ve all seen The Godfather
and all of its splendid. ethnic fla-
vor — not to mention Oscar-
winning performances ~— but
don’t be too quick to categorize
this film. The Pope ofGreenwich

Village is much more than a re-
telling or a standard preaching
of an old genre theme. It offers a
direct-access route into the com-
plex world of New York’s Little
Italy, right down to the pasta.

Vincent Patick’s screenplay,
based on his novel, is a triumph
on a couple of levels. First, it is a
rich story of real people. There
are no caricatures here, and no
character is . spared the wide
range of emotion that marks the
film, from sadness and despair to
celebrated joy. Through all the
emotional swinging, one thing
remains constant: the street’s
omnipresent code.

The story revolves around two
young men, third cousins and
long-time friends from Carmine
Street in the Village. Eric
Roberts portrays Paulie, a 28-
year-old dreamer who longs for
a fat wallet and a grand entrance.
Alas, the proverbial monkey

wrench. Paulie has what his cou-
sin Charlie, played by Mickey
Rourke, calls “a serious thinking
disorder.” His brain is more that
a bit too small for his ambitions.

Bound in a love affair with
Darryl Splash.’ Hannah (who
looks even better sans fins),
Charlie is torn. Love or roots?
High-stung but cautious, Char-
lie is “just one inch away from
being a good man." His biggest
problem? Getting himself out
from under the bungles of his
buddy. ’

As for the acting, the perfor-
mances are astounding. Roberts
succeeds in capturing the light as
well as the disdainful heart; his
grand dreams and youthful
urgency are are spelled out with
precision in his responses to vio-
lence and cruelty. Paulie thinks
“big” but is safe only when this

thoughts are filtered through
Charlie.

The film also offers some fine
supporting performances,
namely those of Geraldine Page
and Burt Young. Page is seen as
the mother of a dishonest detec-
tive, a tough old bird whose
hard-nosed attitude sheds
further light on the community
into which we arepulled. Burt
Young is stellar as the intolerant
and intimidating trucking mag-
nate Eddy Grant. Cumulatively,
the ensemble acting is superb.

From the Sinatra tune that
opens and closes the film to the
wonderful music compsed by
jazz artist Dave Grusin, the film
abounds with a sense of locale.
You have no doubts as to where
you are. The direction of the
confrontation scenes is so skill-
ful that your attention darts

you wonder, “What are they

The writing provides brilliant
insights into the reality of Little
Italy, an area that offers its own
brand of law. As one police
officer remarks, it is the only sec-

and old people are still able to
walk safely at night. Above all
else, even above the feeling of
frustration, is a sense of humor,
a feeling that these people will
survive in spite of themselves

result is a film that is (as Paulie

Houserockers bid
farewell to fans

By Scott Mervis
For The Pitt News

A chapter in Pittsburgh history ended Sunday
night when the city's most loved band, the Iron City
Houserockers, played for the last time. The Decade
was packedtighter than ever with fans "pumpin’ iron
and sweatin' steel"in tribute to this band that grabbed
a city by the heart and held on for eight years.

For the last time, the steel-tough rockers powered
through their gut-wrenching songs that, by now,
sound like nothing less than anthems. As the
bouncers turned people away from the overcrowded
club, the Houserockers played a heated set featuring

"'Rock and Roll Heart,” "Love’s So Tough” and

"Shout/Whole Lotta Shakin" to an ecstatic audience
that shouted choruses over Joe Grushecky’s vocals.
The second set roared with the addition of former-
Houserockers' guitarist Eddie Britt, harmonica player
vMarc Reisman and drummer Ned E. Rankin. This
long,-missed line-up from the band's peak, Have a Good
Time  But Get Out Alive and Blood on the Bricks days,
though separated for two years, played classics "Pum-
pin’ Iron," "Don't Let Them Push You Around” and
"Turn it Up" with enough fury to knock bricks out of
the walls. "Hypnotized" blended Gil Snyder's haunt-
ing keyboards and the manic wails of Reisman's harp
behind Grushecky's horrifying vision of entrapment
by the TV. "Have a Good Time,” with Art Nardini’s
throbbing I bass and Britt's slashing guitar, was
charged with so much raw emotion that the song
ceased to be anything but wild, reckless electricity.
The corner of Rock and Roll shook with thunder.
The third set started with a lot of cake, champagne,
a few "O" dogs and a toast to clubowner and friend
Dom DeSilva. Drummer Ron Foster took the mike to
declare that if the crowds promised to be this large,
the Houserockers would certainly consider breaking‘

The good news is that Houserocker leader Joe Grushecky has
begun to work on his solo career. He recently went into the studio
with a bunch of songs and help from an all-star Pittsburgh cast
including Hermie Granati, from G-Force, Donnie Iris, Silencer
singer Frankie Czuri and Houserockers Art Nardini and Ron
"Bird" Foster. He plans to also use Houserockers pianist Gil
Snyder and guitarist Eddie Britt, as well as Red, Hot and Blues
Warren King.

They came out with four strong songs, including "Goodbye
Steel Town" and "Radio Ears," which debuted Sunday night.
Grushecky says the material uses sophisticated equipment and is
more progressive; however, he promises it doesn't sound like
Duran Duran.

He definitely plans to form another band, but for awhile, he
wants to leave himself open for decisions and inspirations.

up more often. The Houserockers then journeyed
further back to their roots as the Brick Alley Band
with the blues guitar and the comic "Louie, Louie” of
Gary "Diamond Slim" Scalese and an impressive
power-house rendition of "Red House Blues," sung
by original harmonica player Jimmy King. Finally,
they were joined by Silencer's Frank Czuri and
Sharon Parone from Sharon and the Blues Devils for
rousing party versions of The Stones’ "Satisfaction"
and "Brown Sugar.”

It was the end of the night and the end of an eight-
year career filled with success and failure, dreams and
frustrations, and some of the finest rock and roll ever
played.

The Houserockers began in 1976 as a hard—working
blues-based rock band called Brick Alley. After a
rough period of locating and securing places to play,
they found a home at The Decade, where they began
to write some hot original tunes to supplement their
sets of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and John Lee Hooker
covers.

‘ In late '77, ‘they became the Iron City House-
rockers, and their three-song demo (Chuck Berry's

~ "Bye Bye Johnnie," "Heroes Are Hard to Find” and

"Houserocker") caught the attention of Cleveland
International Records, which managed Ian Hunter

and Meatloaf.

This firm assisted them in recording a series of
demos in Cleveland. During this period, the band was
actually playing clubs at night, driving to Cleveland at
6 a.m. the next morning, recording until 5 p.m. and
then returning to Pittsburgh in time for another gig.
The hard work paid off when the demos were sold to
MCA Records and they signed a contract for four
albums. The Iron City Houserockers became Pitts-
burgh's rock and roll hope.

They played in the style of The E Street Band and J.
Geils Band, yet they were good enough and original
enough to gain a small national audience and critical
raves from the likes of Rolling Stone, Creem and The New
York Times.

Upon the release of their brilliant second album,
Have a Good Time But Get Out Alive in 1980, rock critic
Greil Marcus hailed them ”the best hard rock band in
the country” and remarked that "Have a Good Time is
the strongest album an American band has made this
year, and when the year ends, the word ‘American’
may come off." Washington Post writer Robert A. Hull
called them "the next addition to the hallowed hall of
the rock immortals." Creem called Have a Good Time a
"New American Classic.”

The Houserockers were the quintessential blue-
collar band. They looked tough because they really
lived the songs that they played. Singer—songwriter
Joe Grushecky's gritty vocals and tough, urban lyrics
provided a voice for the decaying life—style of the
struggling working class. The songs are filled with
struggles between hope and despair with an under-
current of anger. Relationships in this rusting world,
though powered with strong emotions, are often
marred by disappointment and betrayal:

The night comesfalling down again
This time its too late to pretend 4
We told so many lies

That there's nothing left inside
And there's no place left to hide.

In "Rockola," the life of a steelworker is wracked by
pressure and submission, Some of them want to be your
friend/Most of them drink too much. -
The Houserocker songs tried to inject a spirit of
rebellion in these trapped souls (Take it to the streets/Give
your senator a call/Rip up all the subways/Teardown thegolden

walls) or at least ‘a sense of pride (Don't be ashamed ofthe

places you been.../Walk proud/Don't let Them Push You
Around). This "we're not gonna take it” stance reflects
more of a revolutionary attitude than a typical blue-
collar ethic. It certainly sounds more like the Clash
calling than Bob Seger.

The band came predominantly from blue-collar
backgrounds, and singer Joe Grushecky says that
throughout their rock and roll career, unlike many
musicians, there wasn't a point where they lost touch
with that experience, either in their music or their
lives. '

"My whole family is still blue-collar, and our band
has been a constant’ struggle. We were by no means,
at any time ever, stars. We've always had to struggle
just as hard to make a living with this band as we did
when we were working those shitty jobs," said

Grushecky.

In 1980, the Houserockers took their show to the
road, playing showcase clubs as well as touring with
Ian Hunter, and opening for Lou Reed, Patti Smith,
Meat Loaf and others. Again, they were unanimously
applauded by audiences and critics.

One year later came another critically acclaimed
record, Blood on the Bricks, an appearance on "Solid

Gold" and sold-out dates at clubs like the Roxy in New
York.

The only thing missing was record sales and wider
audiences. Surprisingly, Have a Good Time and Blood on
the Bricks together sold less than a few hundred thou-
sand copies. Part of the problem was an overall slump
in the record industry, and another was a lack of /
support by MCA.

Joe Grushecky points out, "The record company
never knew how to perceive us. We weren't a heavy
metal band or new wave band, so they just didn't’
know what to do with us. We never got the kind of
promotion from them that a lot of other bands got.
For instance, when Bruce Springsteen first came out,
his record company took the publicity that he got and
set it back into the press to make it a phenomenon.
When we got a review, it would just lay there. The“ A’
record company never followed it up with
advertising.”

Their record deal had locked them into a contract
with a company that was not doing the job for them.
Grushecky said that a lot of young bands make the
same mistake of signing a deal and handing their
destiny to a company over which they have no
control.

Bassist Art Nardini has similar feelings. "Havea Good
Time was a great album, and there's no way I could be
disappointed with that. Idid the best Icould have done
on the record, and after the record was done, it was?‘ «I
out of my hands. Then everyone else was supposed to
take over.

"I think they picked the wrong single. It should
have been 'Junior's Bar’ instead of 'Hypnotized.' Sin-
gles have a lot to do with record» sales when you are
not a known band." '

He added, "We did make our records in the worst
part of the record industry's history. Now that MTV
has come around, people are starting to sell recordsf 
again.” Nardini finally shrugs and says, "It's a tough ‘-
business. I knew that when I got into it."

After Blood on the Bricks and the tour, the House-
rockers found themselves in the same bar they had
worked so hard to get out of. Harmonica player Marc
Reisman and drummer Ned E. Rankin believed that
the band's time had come and gone and decided to
pack it in and'leave. Another good album Crackin'

Under Pressure and a great single, "Rock and Roll
Heart,” left the band equally unrecognized by recorcﬁ .1
buyers and saw the departure of guitarist Eddie Britt,
replaced by Marty Moore. So as the steel city turned
high-tech, the Houserockers watched their crowds

begin to decline.

The failure to escape the fate of an aging bar band

prompted the Houserockers to retreat from the stage.
The band mutually agreed that, creatively, they've
taken the Iron City Houserockers as far as they can
80- . ‘
Sunday night's "Old Man Bar" was more meaning-
ful than it has ever been. The lyrics, written for the /
Have a Good Time album, foreshadowed the band's final“ <9
performance:

 

Old man bar

Is where I am and where I'll be

Old man bar

With a juke box full of memories

Old man bar

Till they kill the neon light

I hope no one sees me here tonight

...It's true that I am younger now

But it's very clear the time is catching up with m_ J
I know‘:

   

Sunday night proved that although time had
caught up with the Houserockers, they haven't
missed a beat. It was one of, if not the most passionate
performances of their career.

The Iron City Houserockers gave a lot to the city of
Pittsburgh. They put the city on the map in terms of
rock and roll, allowing more Pittsburgh bands to gain
recognition. They also made The Decade a great
showcase for local bands. .

But more than that, the Houserockers’ gift was 1.6
their fans. For college students, they were one of the
highlights of Oakland life. For all the workers in Pitts-
burgh, the Houserockers provided the music that was
to be their release from the week's heavy toil. From all
of us  Thank you, Houserockers, we needed you.

Heon qualifies

By Laurie Kubli
Staff Writer

Sue Heon became the first
swimmer in Pitt history to make
the U.S. Olympic team by swim-
ming 4:46.72 in the 400-meter
individual medley, Monday in
Indianapolis.

“I’m elated,” Heon said. “It's
something that I’ve worked for
for a long time. It's a dream come
true.

Tracy Caulkins, a senior at the
University of Florida, placed
first in the event with a time of
4:41.37, defending her claim as
America's fastest swimmer, and
quite possibly the best in the
world. She will compete in seven
other events during the trials.

But Heon, just a few strokes

“Sue has a burning desire to
excel,” said Pitt coach Dave
Belowich. “She wants to be the

Heon, of Clark's Summit, Pa.,
is competing in four other events
at the trials: the 200-meter back-
stroke and individual medley,
the 800-meter freestyle and the
400-meter freestyle.

She was to compete in the 400-
meter freestyle preliminary heats
this morning at 8:30. The events
continue through June 30.

Heon is being coached by Dick

A That's the keyword
  for athletic trainers

By Frank Dewlﬂ
Staff Writer

Imagine yourself as an athletic’ ~

trainer. You are kneeling over an
athlete who has been knocked out
cold on the football field. He is face
down and barely breathing. You
now have four to six minutes to deal
with the situation —- without remov-
ing the athlete's helmet. It is one of
those situations where “I don‘t know
what I'd do”just isn't good enough.

Remember, that athlete put his
trust in you before he took the field.
He figured you could handle any of
the critical situations that could
arise during his performance.

So how do you keep him alive?
How do you approach the athlete,
knowing that the slightest misjudg-
ment could result in permanent
injury? What miracles can -you per-
form to enable him to play in next
week's game?

An athletic trainer handles_such
situations on a regular basis. These
men and women bear the burden for
athletics’ most serious side —
injuries. ‘

A series of athletic training work-
shops for high school students were
conducted last week by the Pitt
athletic training staff. The experien-
ces ranged from lectures and activity
labs in IP56 Forbes Quadrangle to
demonstrations at Trees Hall.

Mary Jo Bamford, Rex Call,
Francis Feld, Tony Incorvaia,
David Perrin and Denise Shaw, the
licensed professionals of Pitt’s
athletic staff, and ten student train-
ers took turns schooling their
audience.

Roughly 120 students, some from
as far away as Iowa, were drilled in
the anatomy, injury prevention,
injury recognition and rehabilitative
techniques required to deal with ath-
letes during the three-day series.

The student trainers ~ Janice
Perry, Ed Hunter, Jose Rivera,
Mike Palmisano, Sue Shifren, Phil

Fabrizio, Sheila Culver, Jeff Weiss,
John Thomas and Paula Tomaso-
vich —— guided small groups of stu-
dents through the activities
described in the lectures.

A thorough understanding of
human anatomy is central to the
athletic training body of knowledge.
About a third of the workshop lec-
tures concerned detailed explana-
tions of anatomical structures. More
important was the experience of lis-
tening to a professional putting the
complicated explanations into
action for everyone to understand.

A wide variety of additional sub-
jects were covered in the course,
such as athletic nutrition and careers
in athletic training.

Tours of the Pitt School of Medi-
cine’s Anatomy Laboratory and of
Pitt Stadium's strength-training and
athletic-training facilities were also
included.

So, when all is said and done.
what is the role ofan athletic trainer‘?

He or she is to maintain and
improve the health of the athlete.
His view of sports is geared toward
its ability to seriously impair, in
order to provide the athlete with
preventive techniques. He or she
administers first-aid, evaluates the
severity of injuries and prescribes
rehabilitative programs.

Not to mention taping, educating
athletes about proper procedures for
injury management, providing
health care systems, prescribing pro-
tective equipment and monitoring
the nutritional needs of each athlete.

In other words, the athletic trainer
has a lot to keep him busy. Bump
into him on the street and, although
he may not have the time to talk,
he'll surely have the time to make
sure you are all right.

That‘s his job, or one of them,
anyway. ‘

PROVIDENCE, RI —~ The Big
East men’s basketball conference
named G. Arthur Hyland to head
the new conference officiating
bureau.

'“By establishing a Big East offi-
ciating service, our members will
obtain the services of the best availa-

ference and home non-conference
games," Big East commissioner
Dave Gavitt said.

“The creation ofa conference offi-
ciating service is a logical step in the
growth of the Big East. For the past
five seasons, officials were assigned
by the Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Conference (ECAC) whose service
was outstanding. However, our
member institutions felt the time
had come for the Big East to assume
this responsibility as a conference
function.”

- At the conference’s annual meet-
ing in May, Big East athletic direc-

. tors provided Gavitt with guidelines

for the creation of the officiating
bureau to be directed by a part-time

 

supervisor of officials.

“While establishing a Big East

officiating bureau, it became appar-
ent Art Hyland could possibly be
available for the post of supervisor.
His decision to begin a legal career
coincided with the conference’s deci-
sion to assume total responsibility
for basketball officiating. He is
respected by coaches, administra-
tors and officials. We’re extremely
pleased to have a man of his reputa-
tion and abilities head our new ser-
vice,” Gavitt said.

Hyland was associate commis-
sioner for the ECAC for the past
four years after serving eight years as
assistant commissioner. As part of
his position, he was ECAC supervi-
sor of basketball and football
officials.

Last season, he served as an inde- .

pendent supervisor of football offi-
cials for nine major football schools
including Pitt, Boston College, Sy-
rd.Cti~5-'.‘, Notre Dame and Penn State.

A I984 graduate of Boston‘s Suf-
folk Law School, he will begin legal
practice with a Hyannis, Mass., law
firm on July I.

  Big East picks officiating chief

“The creation of a
conference officiat-

ing service is a logi-

cal step in the
growth of the Big
East.”

——Dave Gavitt

A native of Philadelphia, he was a
three-year basketball starter and
All-Ivy first-team player‘ at Prince-
ton. In addition, he earned All-
America selection in lacrosse.

Following graduation in 1963, he
served in the Army before joining
Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith as an account executive. _In
I966, he began his career in athletic
administration as an assistant bas-
ketball coach at Princeton under
Butch Van Breda Koff and later

C under ‘Peter Carill.
