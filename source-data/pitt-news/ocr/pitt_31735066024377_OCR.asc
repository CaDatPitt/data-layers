All the United States has given
African-Americans is “naked white
terrorism shooting us in the streets
like dogs,” according to Kwame Ture,
who spoke in the William Pitt Union
last night.

The Black Action Society sponsored
the lecture last night as part of Black
History Month. I '

Ture, a socialist, was formerly known
as Stokely Carmichael. and has been
active in the civil—rights movement for
over two decades. K

Ture, the head of the All-African
People’s Revolutionary Party, said
capitalism is the enemy of the African—
American people because it tries to
discount the contributions of the
masses.

System
will end
computer
abuses

By Susan Swiderski
For The Pill News

A new computer system that
will eliminate the problem of non-
university personnel using the
labs will be implemented by this
year’s summer session.

The AFS system was unveiled
at yesterday’s Computing and
Information Services Student
Focus Group forum.

According to Manager of
Computing Lab Services David
Schatz, anyone can walk into a
University ofPittsburgh computer
lab and take advantage of the
services.

With AFS this problem will be
eliminated because the ‘system
will only be open to students,
staff and faculty.

Each person will need a user
name and password to access the
system.

Students who sign up for UNIX
accounts will automatically be on
the AFS network, and those who
received their UNIX accounts
before August 1991 can update
very easily.

With AFS there will be only one
machine for all ofthe labs instead
of one per lab.

Less maintainance will be
required and that will keep labor
costs for upkeep and repairs low,
Schatz said.

As soon as there is a way to
simplify the access procedure,
students will be able to access
directories from the other
universities that are hooked up to
AFS. .

Funding for the AFS system
came from the capital budget of
Computing and Information
Services and the Executive
Committee of Academic
Computing, a faculty committee
which also has one student
member.

Extensive sea rcbes, new data bases feoztn res of PittCat Plus

By Julie Sabol

News Assistant

More extensive subject searching and
easier-to-read screens are several of the
advantages the newly installed PittCat
Plus system has brought to H illman Library.

This week the PittCat Plus system was
installed and ready for use in Hillman. It’s

intended to be a new version of the

existing system and an improvement to

the old software. .
“The installation is a significant event

because it is such a major upgrade,” said

Paul Kobulnicky, interim director of the
university library system.

Students will see a few changes on the
computers when using the new system. A
list of commands and directions on their
are first shown on the screen.

When a student calls up a book, the
author, title and location are shown, but a
longer, more detailed view is also
available.

“It's much easier to read. All the
information you need is on one screen,
and at a glance it’s easy to tell what you’re
looking at," said Amy Knapp, a librarian at

I-Iillman.

Another feature of the system is cross-
referencing, which allows students to find
more books on the subject they are looking
for.

Plans are also under way to have two
additional data bases in the system by the
end of the semester. ABI/INFORM, a
business and social—science data base, and
Psych INFO, articles and dissertations in
psychology and the behavioral sciences,
will soon be accessible on the new system.

These will allow students to obtain
information about various professional

journals.

Students are still able to dial into the
system from their dorm or home computers.
The instructions are the same.

People seem to be pleased with the
system, and there were not many
complaints, according to the Hillmaﬂ
librarians.

Though there are many improvements.
the system is not hard to use, said several
students at I-Iillman. "

As University of Pittsburgh student
Derrick Jones said, “Just follow the
commands and it’s easy."

Pitt ODK recolonizes

By Lori M. Bossert
For The Pm News

Omicron Delta Kappa is an
unfamiliar name to most Pitt
students, but its members are
hoping to change that.

ODK recognizes students who
excel in the areas of leadership
and scholarship. Originally

- founded in 1917, the society's

third chapter was colonized at
Pitt within the same year.

The group has dwindled at Pitt
over the last six years, falling to
just five members this past year.

“It almost died out by the nature
of its construction,” said Robert
Williams, ODK’s vice president.
“It’s a senior honor society, and
seniors don't usually have much
time to devote to the
organization.”

“We’re hoping to make ODK
membership more than a pin, a
certificate and a pat on the back”
said Brent Saunders, ODK
treasurer. “We want to bring some
purpose and honor back into the

organization.”

The group's members are
working towards that goal by
taking several steps to revitalize
the society on Pitt's campus. They
will initiate 58 new members
today at Heinz Chapel.

After the ceremony, both
members and alumni will attend
a banquet at the Duquesne Club,
celebrating ODK’s 75th
anniversary. Members will have
a chance to mingle with Pitt ODK
alumni from as far back as 1928.

As well, the group hopes to
further the relationship between
current ODK members on Pitt's
campus and the area’s ODK
alumni. They are hoping to make
the alumni a resource to the
members for career advice and
networking.

“We’re hoping to make ODK
membership a resource for the
members,” Saunders said. “Many
[of the alumni] were student
leaders. They understand the
responsibility that goes with the
positions.”

ON DISPLAY IN THE CONNEY M. KIMBO GALLERY
STUDENT ART SHOW

THEME: PRODUCTS OF EVOLUTION,
THE YEAR 2020

Student art show opens

By Heather York
Staﬂ" Writer

Ian James Schirman won first place and $100 at the student art
exhibit for his painting entitled, “Doganin Katledilmesi,” which
is Hungarian for “nature's crucifixion.”

The exhibit opened Monday night in the Conney Kimbo Art
Gallery in the William Pitt Union. Sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council, the exhibit features 25 student paintings, drawings and
sculptures. Two judges from the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts
presented the awards at Monday's grand opening.

The theme is “Products of Evolution —— the year 2020.”

“A lot of people did futuristic things,” said Julie Veil, arts
committee director at PPC. “Some looked at the future of people
or the environment.”

Ben Gromicko won second place and $75 for his sculpture,
“Life’s Cry.” The sculpture is a Combination of wood, paint and
metal and is adorned with “The People of Earth's Prayer.”

The third—place prize of $50 went to Kent Wallisch for his
sculpture ‘‘In a Bind.” He said the jute rope, pine oak and paraffin
structure represents the bind the environment is in, and that the
beauty of today will not exist in the future. ’

This is the second year for the student exhibit. This year PPC
added the theme because it would be easier to judge, Veil said.

In addition to the overall prizes, $25 awardswere offered to
artists in various categories. Nancy Schromek’s “Harmony” won
the best painting award, and William Ganis’ “Schema” won the
prize for best sculpture. The exhibit runs until Feb. 28.

Growing film popularity of city
brings increased revenue here

University participates  

1?

in global computing
experiments, research

By Jenn Spagnuolo
For The Pitt News

International academia and industry will finally come together
through the University of Pittsburgh. The Center for Parallel, '
Distributed and Intelligent Systems has been awarded for its
success in establishing ties with Southeast Asia for research in
education, industry and government. S.K. Chang, a professor in
Pitt’s computer science department, is the director of CPDIS.

Ties between Southeast Asia and the United States were built
under the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation. This American
organization will bring universities in Malaysia and Singapore
together with Pitt, Washington State University and Carnegie
Mellon University.

All participating schools will be granted $100,000 by the
Agency for International Development for two years of study
together. '

The CPDIS will focus on multimedia and multilingual
know1edge—based engineering. The partnership with the
department of mathematics of the University of Malaysia and the
Institute of Systems Science of the National University of
Singapore will work to accelerate economic and technological
development around the world.

The program requires professors to share their experience
and knowledge by teaching courses. Chang will be teaching the
first course on Image Information Systems.

He will spend one day in Malaysia and one day in Singapore
in March.

The second course will be taught by professor Alfs Berztiss,
also from Pitt’s department of computer science. Berztiss will
Spend three days in Singapore in April teaching Requirements
Engineering: The Key to High Quality Software.

Although only faculty from Pitt will be going to Southeast
Asia, students from Malaysia and Singapore will be joining them.
Engineers, scientists and programmers will also be attending the
classes.

Recognizing the great competition between Pitt and CMU as
research Centers, Chang said this is “a great success for Pitt.”
According to Chang it is a great chance for the university to
“continue higher education and fulfill goals as a research center”
while working with foreign industry and universities.

It’s chock-full of “rolling country
hills,” industrial towns and big-

‘ time Hollywood producers.

But this is Pittsburgh, not L.A.,
and with its increasing popularity
among filmmakers, productions
are bringing in millions for the
local economy.

According to Robert Curran,
director of the Pittsburgh Film

Office, the city has made over
$65 million from film production
since the office opened two years
ago.

And because of‘ all the
investment returns, “the
Department of Commerce and
Legislature are very happy,”
Curran said. »

Movie director John Landis,
whose films include National
Lampoons Animal House and
The Blues Brothers, has recently

begun production of Innocent
Blood in Pittsburgh.

Innocent Blood, slated to be
released this fall, is part monster

movie, part mob movie, and is.

expected to generate $7 million
to $10 million for the city.

The movie is about a discerning
vampire (played by Anne
Parillaud of La Femme Nikita)
whose victims are all bad guys,
including mobsters.

Football player Charged with assault

By Rebecca Baker
Sta1fWriter

A Pitt football player was charged with assaulting
a first-year student at a party in an Oakland
apartment in December.

Kevin G. Williams, a sophomore running back,
was held for court on Jan. 28. Williams lost the first
hearing but plans to appeal.

The woman involved in the incident said Williams
pushed her off a porch step as she was leaving his

party. She then threw a cup of beer on Williams, .

and she said he threatened to kill her.

“He grabbed my throat and pinned me over the
balcony,” she said. “When I tried to fight back, he
started hitting me.” The woman said when some of

Williams’ friends came outside to hold him back,
he kicked her in the stomach.

At the trial, Williams’ roommate and another
friend testified that Williams acted in self defense
because the woman attacked Williams first,
according to The Pittsburgh Press. The woman
claimed Williams’ friends were not outside at the
onset of the fight. ,

Alex Kramer, administrative assistant to Pitt
football coach Paul Hackett, called the incident
“extremely minor” and said it is Williams’ word
against the woman’s word.

“I believe in the American justice system and that

you are innocent until proven guilty,” Kramer said. ' ’

The woman said she would drop all charges if
Williams paid a $1,500 fine. '

Majchael Tajchman said he has
always been interested in issues
regarding violence against
women because he has always
known women whose lives were
affected by men's violence.

“I saw differentexamples while
growing up of how that type of
violence is impacted on women’s
lives —- women that l’ve really
cared a lot about,” T ajchman
said.

The 24-year-old Wichita native
moved to Pittsburgh two and a
halfyears ago, after receiving his
bachelor's degree in social work
from Lawrence College in Kansas.
He found a job working with
adolescents at Western
Psychiatric Institute & Clinic,
began his master's in social work
at Pitt and founded Men Against
Rape And Pornography.

“Some friends of mine and I
had gone to a conference in
Atlanta a couple summers ago
and came back feeling pretty
inspired. We realized there were
activist anti-sexist men's groups
in other parts of the country, and
there wasn't one here,” he said.
“Part of the goal was to fill that
gap and to get men more involved
in raising awareness and doing
political action."

Tajchrnan said MAR/\l”s main
concerns are gr,-neral topics of
violence against women and
raising awareness of how
pornography affects sexual
violence.

According to Tajchman, his
group's position on pornography
is frequently misunderstood.

“lly trying to promote
awareness and take a critical view
of porriograpliy, we're viewed as
pro-censorship, when in fact
we've never advocated that and
never will,” he said. “Other anti-
pornography groups, right-wing
fundamentalist Christian groups,
have advocated banning and
censorship and view
pornography as obscene and
dirty, whereas that's not otir point

of view at all.

“it’s not about being anti-sex or
in favor of censorship or being
prudish. It's really about taking a
critical look at how men use
pornography against women,” he
said.

Tajchman is concerned that
some may equate criticism of
pornography with denying one’s
sexuality.

“What I’m critici'/.ing is the
violence and the humiliation and
the degradation that men do to
women through porn, and if that's
equated with sex, it shows how a
lot of people don’t see a difference
between violence and sex,” he
said.

Tajchman said Andrea
Dworkin, a feminist writer, has
been an inspiration to him and
taught him how pornography is
used against women.

‘‘I think men use it as a how—to
book on doing violence against
women,” he said.

He said that some of the major
messages in pornography — that
women want to be degraded,
humiliated and viewed as objects
— contribute to the idea that

Jason Hillman/l‘he Pitt News
Majchael Tajchman, founder of Men Against Rape and Pornography.

violence against women is
acceptable and legitimate.

“In addition to that it functions
to keep men on top and to keep
women as second-class objects,
and if women are viewed just as
their body parts and as non-
human, then the economic and
political and social opportunities
are also going to be diminished.
And that's diminishing women’s
civil rights,” Tajchman said.

When MARAP first began,
Tajchman hoped the gay
community would become
involved, but he is now
disappointed at the lack of
concern gay men have
demonstrated.

‘‘I had this hope that gay men
might be a little bit more hip as to
what it might feel like to be an
oppressed group, but ultimately
I don’t think they feel that type of
oppression that women do and
that level of violence and that
level of real internal second
classness that comes with
oppression,” he said.

Tajchman began a Men
Stopping Rape ' project as an
educational program of MARAP.

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Wednesday, Februaf)’ 5. 1992
 

Student educates about it

“I'd really like to see this sort of
thing become more widespread.,”
Tajchman said. “At other
universities date-rape education
is a staple in the programs that
incoming students receive, and I
think it’s a shame that Pitt doesn't
have something that's more
institutionalized.”

The group did training for Pitt's
resident assistants last fall, and it
has spoken to several classes.

Tajchman said it is crucial for
men to become educated about
and protest against violence
against women and institutions
(such as pornography) that
promote it.

“I think it’s really time for the
men who aren’t doing the
violence against women to start
challenging other men who are,
and I think even though men
might beaware, by their silence
they become accomplices to the
incredible, backlash against
women right now,” he said.

He cited the Surgeon General’s
report that said every five years
more women are killed by their
batterers than the total number of
people killed in the Vietnam War
— 58,000.

“When I see something like
that it frightens me. It makes me
really worried and really sad,”
Tajchman said.

Tajchman also belongs to CRY
OUT /AC’ F UP, a gay-rights activist
group, and the Pittsburgh Men’S
Collective, a self help/discussion
group.

Tajchman will graduate in
December and hopes to find a
job in a school system or a mental
health center. He said he would
like to continue working in issues
of violence against women in his
personal and perhaps also his
professional life.

“Feminism becomes more
activist-oriented when there is a
backlash, like now,” he said. “The
cases of Anita Hill and the woman
who was raped by William
Kennedy Smith certainly have
motivated numbers of women to

join feminist organizations and to
become activists.”

Copy Cat
seen as part
of university
monopoly

By Donna Pesansky
For T be Pitt News

While staff at Pitt’s Copy Cat
said the store offers competitive
prices and good service, many
students are concerned about
what they see as a growing
university monopoly on Forbes
Avenue.

The Copy Cat, which opened
last month, is an expansion of
Central Business Services’
McCormick Annex, said Bob
Moran, assistant manager at the
Pitt Copy Cat. Moran said Pitt
chose not to renew the lease of
the Kinko’s Copies that formerly
occupied the spot.

At the Copy Cat machine-fed
copies are three cents each. No
taxes are charged because the
materials sold at the Copy Cat are
for educational purposes, Moran
said. The clientele of the Copy
Cat is limited to university faculty,
staff and students-with valid ID.

Several students expressed their
dissatisfaction with the university
presence in Oakland.

Pitt student James Degus said
the university is “booting
everything out and it’s hurting
the student.”

He said the university is turning
Forbes Avenue into a monopoly
of university services.

Student Jay Nyman said that
Kinko’s previous location made
it safer for students to walk late at
night and itwas more convenient
because it was open 24 hours a
day.

Sophomore Ed Goldhahn said
The Copy Cat needs more color,

Allegheny Countyjudge Cheryl
Allen Craig said perseverance and
determination helped her meet
the challenges facing a black
woman in her profession.

Craig, one ofonly a handful of
elected officials in Allegheny
County, attributes her success to

la strong work ethic.

“You need to be willing to
work hard and have perseverance
to make it today,” Craig said.
“You might have to work a little
harder ifyou’re black, but there is
nothing you can’t accomplish.”

Throughout her life Craig has
been part of organizations
committed to racial equality. She
served as the president of Women
for Racial Equality and was an
active member of the Wilkinsburg
chapter of the NAACP. Currently,
she serves on the board of 'l ‘u rning
Point at Washington, a facility for
women recovering from
addiction.

Craig is the oldest daughter of
a retired steel worker and a postal
worker. Born in Homestead,'Craig
said her parents encouraged her
to achieve her goals.

“My parents taught me I could
be whatever I wanted if I worked
hard and didn't become
discouraged when I am met with
either racism or sexism.”

Craig graduated from Schenley
High.School in 1965. In 1969 she
graduated from Penn State

year, Craig served on the bench
of the criminal division. Last
month Craig moved into her
current position as juvenile court
judge.

“Being a criminal court judge
was rewarding, but as a.juvenile
court judge you are dealing with
young people, a place where you
can make a difference,” she said.

Three days a week Craig takes
the bench on cases dealing with
juveniles who have been accused
of committing crimes forlwhich
they can- be fined or placed in a

\ juvenile detention center.

On the other two days, Craig
handles dependency cases, where
she must look at whether parents
are still able to adequately provide
for the care of their child. If not,
Craig must come up with an

“We are most cohcerned with
seeing the child receives adequate
care,” Craig said. “We try to keep
the family together at all costs.”

In the worst-case scenario,
placement of the child back into
the home of the parents is not
feasible. When this happens, Craig
must decide whether or not to
terminate the parental rights and
make the child eligible for
adopuon.

“This is a very emotionally
charged area of the law. Decisions
have far-reaching impact on
children’s lives,” she said.

Aside from her hectic
professional schedule, Craig still
find time to spend on personal
interests. Married and mother of
three, she says she enjoys a very

Craig also serves on the

Craig maintained the
philosophy that doing the best
possible job on any task will help
blacks overcome racial obstacles.

“Most people will give you a

harder to get it,.but it can be
done. Most importantly, you have

to show you can do a good job.”.

Nursing prof receives
Health Services award

By Tonya Wilson
IbrHwPWUWws

Don’t be surprised if it seems almost impossible to locate
Laverne Rocereto. You might find her at a meeting planning
nursing curriculum or volunteering her time teaching anthropology
at Western Penitentiary.

It was because of her work at Western Penitentiary that she
received two awards this past year.

She received the “Health and Human Services” award from the
Greater Pittsburgh YMCA because of a letter the prisoners sent
praising her services. ~

“They’ve had their ups and downs in life, but sometimes those
guys do have good hearts,” Rocereto said. ‘

As professor of nursing at the school of Nursing and Health
Related"—Professions, Rocereto is currently working on a new
nursing program that will begin in September.

She has taught many courses since she started at Pitt 50 years
ago, but she is looking forward to the new program in September
because she will be able to work more closely with her students.
“I really wish I could know students in a more personal way.”

“You must really like it” is one piece of advice Rocereto gives
to students interested in nursing. When she is not working,
Rocereto enjoys cooking. She has a degree in Chinese cooking
and said, “When I retire I just want to work somewhere in a,
Chinese restaurant.”

This past year she also received Duquesne University’s “Dean’s
Medallion,” which is awarded to graduates of Duqu_esne University
who have achieved notariety in their professions. “I cried. I felt
very humble,” she said.

“I always liked the idea of helping people” is one of the reasons
Rocereto gave for entering the nursing profession.

A native of Pittsburgh, Rocereto said her parents have inﬂuenced
her the most and taught her how to love people which is
something she said she could never have learned in college.

Rocereto received her bachelor’s degree in nursing and her
master’s degree and doctorate from the University of Pittsburgh.

According to Curran, a percent
of the overall production budget
goes to the actual “building of
the sets, plywood, hotel rooms,
food and local crew pay.”

Landis will actually shoot
Pittsburgh as New York, which
happens very often, according to
Curran. Pittsburgh generally
substitutes for New York,
Baltimore —any place but
Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is often chosen

‘because “the logistics of moving

around the city is very easy,”
Curran said.

“We have rolling country hills
and industrial towns all in one
area,” he said.

When Silence of the Lambs was
filmed here, “we were able to get
a lot of looks and styles in one
area, so it didn’t impact on the
actors’ schedules,” Curran said.

a busy time. Hoffa, the Danny De
Vito feature with Jack Nicholson
in the title role, will be in town for
six to eight weeks of filming.

Hoffa, budgeted at $35 million,
should bring in $7 million to $10
million for Pittsburgh, according
to Curran.

Citizen C0/an, an I-IBO movie
about Roy Cohn starring James
Woods, will begin shooting here
within the next two months.

_ According to HBO, Citizen
Cobn is the biography of Roy

who assisted Sen. Joseph
McCarthy during the House
Committee on Un—American
Activities hearings and was
eventually disbarred in New York.

“Citizen Cohn, should
generate $2 million to $3 million,”
Curran said.

In the past two years the
Pittsburgh Film Office, run only
by Curran and his assistant, has
produced 22 films and a budget
exceeding $600,000 a week.

Every year they attend a trade
show in California, which is
designed to show off every city
and what it has to offer.

“I believe in the power of
advertising,” Curran said, "and
the most important thing is being
able to get repeat business.”

When asked about the actors’
reactions to Pittsburgh, Curran
said most are surprised to find it's
not the smoky steel town they
might have expected.

The Alligator
Gainesville, Florida

A University of Florida student,
Stephen Ball, allegedly drove his
car over another student, breaking
the man’s ankle. He was charged
with aggravated battery and
released on his own recognizance
Sunday.

Ball intentionally accelerated
his. car to throw Adams off the
hood. Ball then drove his car
over Adams, causing a compound
fracture to the right leg.

The Cavalier Daily
University of Virginia

Members of the student media
nationwide are being challenged
with the question of whether the
First Amendment protects
revisionism of the Holocaust. An
advertisement authored by
Bradley Smith, director of the
Committee for Open Discussion
of the Holocaust, claims Nazi-
controlled Germany did not have
“a policy to exterrriinate thelewish
people by putting them to death
in gas chambers or by killing
them through abuse or neglect 
No execution gas chambers
existed in any camp in Europe,
which was under German
control."

Smith sent the ad to several
college publications across the
country, although it has been
printed in only six so far. When
the Duke University's Chronicle
included the ad, it evoked protest
from the student body. Letters
were written demanding the
editor‘resign and students boycott
the paper.

sciences, only 29 percent of

women. Girls were trained to be
feminine and much of science is
dirty and messy, especially in the
physical sciences, which are

University of Pennsylvania

A disgruntled English professor,
Martin Orzeck, telephoned the
White House last Monday night
to complain about the economy,
lost his temper with the

switchboard operator and called .

President Bush a “Nazi racist."

. When he opened his door the
next morning, he saw two
uniformed police officers and two
plainclothes officers. One of the
plainclothes officers flashed a
badge, identified himself as a

member of the Secret Service,
and said, “Tell me, Martin, did
you make a phone call threatening
George Bush last night?" The
professor asked if he were going
to be arrested, the officers replied,
“Well, we can arrest you.”

“Either arrest me or get out,”
Orzeck returned. The officer
departed without questioning him
further.

Carnegie Mellon University

A new sexual-assault policy
has been officially approved by
the faculty and student senates.
The new policy will provide
assault victims with easy access
to advisers and legal procedures
dealing with their assault.

A panel of advisers consisting
of students, faculty and others
will provide victims with multiple
contact points. The goal is to give
the assault victim the greatest
possible degree of comfort when
discussing the assault and
available options.

The new policy hopes to
increase assault awareness, while
providing victims with
information concerning the
processes and procedures
involved in reporting the crime.
The victim will remain in total
control of the situation, officials
said.

Hate on campus continues

Racial tension in America is not a recent development.
But recent indicators show an explosion is coming.
Adding to the climate of hate have been politicians who
race bait, pitting whites against blacks in campaign
advertisements. ’

North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms used images of a man
losing his job to an affirmative-action program to imply»
that blacks are “stealing” white jobs.

On campus, the situation is no better. A white fraternity’s
slave auction in blackface fueled racial ﬂames at the
University of Michigan. Reports of student expulsions for
racial slurs are commonplace.

Last week, a column published in The Daily Collegian
(Penn State University) drew fire because of its racially
explosive content. In it the African-American writer,
Chino Wilson, said, “lTlhere is only one conclusion: White
people are devils” and “To protect ourselves, we should
bear arms (three handguns and two rifles — maybe an M?
16) immediately and form a militia to defend [ourselvesl.”
Among other ideas, Wilson urged, “Black people, let us
unite, organize and execute.”

Wilson wrote, “The vast majority [of white people] — by
that I mean 85-90 percent, however, are devout racists.”

By indicting this many people, he may as well have said
100 percent. Racism permeates every institution, social
agency and various levels of government. Regardless of ~
how one identifies using the term “race,” no one can

escape.

Lumping all whites in the same racist category with
someone like David Duke is absurd. Sure, white people
_—as a matter of fact, men or heterosexuals —— may not
understand oppression against a certain group. But to
'; throw words like racist, hornophobe, sexist or anti—Se_mite. _ .
' around like so many mashed potatoes reduces the power
and meaning of those words that describe painful

oppression.

Promoting violence is counterproductive and dangerous.
In America, racism is not as clear as black and white. In
fact, those categories are ever—changing. “White” is not
some fixed category. Early this century in America, people
of Mediterranean descent and Jews were considered
“non—whites.” Some race—conscious observers still think

SO.

Wilson said white people created AIDS to kill off black

people.

While it is true that the government response to AIDS is
lacking because the disease affects gay white men and
people of color, the government’s response to any health-
care crisis that affects minority people is abysmal.

Certainly The Collegian has a right to publish racially
charged speech; it must be an editorial decision. But
speech that fosters hate will only silence viable discourse
that can fight racism or, for that matter, oppression;

In this country, the enthusiasm
for altering one’s state of mind is
as strong as ever. Altered states
are what most people are after.
They want to be happy, joyous,
centered or relaxed.

They feel frustrated, tired, upset
or bored. So what do most people
do? Turning on a TV set gives a
temporary escape. It doesn’t stop
there. People bombard their

mind,s_ and bodies with everything . .

from excessive eating to
exhaustive sex, from cigarettes to
caffeine pills, from alcohol to
cough syrup, from mushrooms
to crack. While this societal trait
is reinforced by advertisers,
corporations and governments,
the official response is “just say
no.

Why ask why? Grab a cold
beer, and forget about whatever
bothers you ———what a great
marketing strategy. Advertisers
persuade millions of frustrated
people to stop asking questions,
to live for the moment and to
accept fate.

Too many of us leave ourselves
at the mercy of outside events
over which we may have no
control, failing to take charge of
our emotions — over which we
all have control — and relying
instead on short-term quick fixes.

While less than 5 percent of the
world’s population lives in the
United States, we consume more
than 50 percent of the world's
cocaine. Our national defense
budget, which currently runs in
the billions, is equaled by what
we spend on alcohol
consumption.

When Lynn Townsend took
charge of Chrysler during an
industry-wide sales slump, he
fired two-thirds of the engineering
staff. In that short-term fix, profit
shot up, but in a few years Chrysler
went through financial
withdrawal again. C E O s
are often injuring ourcompanies’
prospects and rewarding

themselves in the present because

they produce results in the short
term. If there is something wrong
with the way things are going in
the United States (whether
economically, socially or
politically), then who do we
blame?

The Japanese are as wrong
about American workers being

countries don’t take responsibility
for their own lives, an alibi is
needed to explain why they are
unhappy or unfulﬁlled.

It is fitting that President Bush,
in his role as national symbol,
should insist that it is the rest of
the world's responsibility to
supply the fix for our social,
economic and military addictions.
It is no wonder he is called “the
foreign policy president.”

Are his hands “cuffed” here at
home? In election ’92, the auto
industry and oil companies won't
be allowed in the polling booths.
Unfortunately, half of us won’t
be involved in the election either.

It may be in the government’s
best interest to push a pacifier
into the American mouth. In
particular, there is one agency
that can hold itself above the law.
A. skillfully mass—communicated
lie does alter our perceptions,
create new states of mind, reform
our behavior and reshape our
reality.

The CIA can create an
environment that causes people
to doubt what they've always
believed and then give them new
ideas and experiences to support
the adoption of new beliefs.

No president has ever
succeeded in challenging the CIA.
In fact, our current executive chief

of state, George Bush, has been
intimately involved with the CIA
as its director. Most people in this
country, including politicians, are
more afraid of certain government
branches than of the Mafia,
terrorists or any other foreign
threat. ’

Naturally, we are seeking a
more ‘pleasurable state of mind
and avoiding a more sober reality.
Therefore, it is"j‘easy.to believe
what our elementary-sc'ho"“ol
teachers told us about our
government.

The classroom situation dictates
what you will learn, what you
will do and who you will be. We
are in a dependent relationship
with the teacher. We must “get”
what they tell us and keep coming
back for more — or we fail. Face
it, we are just as socialized as any
“evil empire” ever was. ‘But our
heritage is supposed to maintain
a tradition of rebellion.

Maybe the political scene works
to drug the rebel in us. In fact, an

analogy can be made between S

the politician's campaign and the
pusher’s junk. It is the bottom
line in both pursuits to take away
the people's worries. They both
promise that a pleasurable “state”
will follow if only we choose
them.

If we believe their speeches,
we see things they way they want
us to and we become addicted to
the product (no worries) and the
effect (no questions). Injection
after injection, they can avoid
specific issues, remain objective,
and use catchy phrases to keep
their customers coming back. A

If you decide to risk it and you
do vote, then in the words of
Queensryche’s Geoff Tate, “Don't
ever trust the needle, it lies." We
are always responsible for the
outcome of our decisions. How
long can we be expected to
willingly remain sedated?

The Miami basketball team kept
the pace slow and the game
sloppy for most of the first half
last night, just like they wanted,
so Pitt beat them by 0nly22 points
this time, 77-55.

In the previous meeting
between the two teams Pitt
bludgeoned Miami to death on
the inside, so the ‘Canes tried to
force the Panther guards to beat
them. Shooting guard Ahmad
Shareef responded to the
opportunity with 11 first-half
points (20 for the night), including
two three-pointers. Shareef had
not cracked the 20-point mark
since Pitt’s second game of the
season against Kentucky. He had
not previously hit a three—pointer
in Big East play.

Pitt was not able to pull away
until late in the first half, due in
large part to 14 first-half turnovers.
The Panthers normally do a much
better job taking care of the
basketball, but they seemed to
get frustrated by the slow pace of
the game and pushed too hard.
Another factor keeping it close
was the interior defense of the
Hurricanes’ 7-foot, 5-inch center,
Constantin Popa. Popa blocked
four shots on the night, the same
number as the previous meeting
with Pitt, but also altered quite a
few others.

Still, the Panthers never trailed,
and the last tie was broken by
Chris McNeal’s 17-foot jumper,
which put them ahead 6-4 two
minutes into the contest.

Fighting has been part of
the game since it started 75
years ago, and fighting will
probably always remain
part of the game.

The reason I feel the NHL
isn’t taken seriously by a lot
of American fans is because
of the poor officiating, a
topic raised a week ago by
Mario Lemieux after a
poorly officiated game
against Washington. The
NHL is the worst-officiated
of all the major sports.
Blatant fouls go uncalled,
while questionable ones are
called. In the third period
of games, penalties are
usually not called after the
10-minute mark. Can you
imagine a major-league
umpire not calling strikes
in the ninth inning of a
baseball game?

What’s worse than the
poor officiating is the

Analysis

. where the points are. An abysmal

four-game homestand ended
Monday, with the Pens and Detroit
Red Wings skating to a 4-alltie.
Both squads showed their
respective strengths, but it was
the Red Wings who struck first. It
wasn’t pretty. Tom Barrasso
suffered a mental lapse and dished
the puck to a wide-open Sergei
Fedorov, who showed no signs
of being a respectful visitor and
ﬂipped the puck under the
befuddled Barrasso and into the
empty cage. The Wings came out
hard right from the get-go, taking
the body to the Pens and standing
them up at the blueline while
moving the puck quickly up the
ice and out of their own zone.
The Wings were supposed to be
weak up front, but this team goes
four solid lines deep and has a
nice blend of speed (Steve
Yzerman, Fedorov, Paul Ysebart)
and size (Bob Probert, Ray
Sheppard). Later in the first, that
combination extended the Wings’
lead to 2-0. Sheppard deeked
Barrasso from in tight, scoring his
26th of the campaign — a power-

play tally.

The ground birds got going
early in the second frame, as
Mark Recchi took a nice, centering
pass from Kevin Stevens and
smoked a wrist shot past Detroit
goalie and former Pen Greg
Millen. This early goal was a sign
of things to come for the Pens, as
they stormed into the Detroit
zone. The game opened up
offensively, and the Pe_ns
countered Detroit’s physical play
with speed and skill. The line of
Stevens, Recchi and Bryan Trottier
accounted for all the Penguins’
tallies on the evening, including
a rare homepower-play tally that
tied the game at two. Trottier got

credit for the goal, as Larry

' Murphy's point shot deflected off

his skate and under the crossbar.
Trottier got his second goal of the
period and eighth of the season
later in the second, and Pittsburgh
went to the locker room up 3-2

_ with three minutes remaining on
a major penalty to defenseman

Yves Racine.

Then Steve Yzerman showed
his wheels. He caught up to=a
loose puck and broke in all alone
on Barrasso and used him for his
29th goal of the year, a
shorthanded strike. Fedorov
struck again late in the period, as
he grabbed a rebound high in the
slot, walked in on Barrasso and
again scorched him for his 20th
of the year. Mark Recchi added
his second goal of the game when
he bumrushed the net, pounced
on a loose puck and beat,Millen

So the Pens went 1-2-1 on their

around this time last year: After
slumping at home injanuary, the
Pens became unbeatable at the

Mazeroski deserves Hall of Fame

By Keith Cromer
For The Pill News

A grey cloud was cast over the
city of Pittsburgh with the
announcement of the new
inductees into the Baseball Hall
of Fame.

As Mets and Athletics fans
applauded the enshrinement of
Tom Terriﬁc and Reliable Rollie,
I was once again distraught over
the snubbing of Bill Mazeroski
for baseball’s ultimate honor. I
was faced with the harsh reality
that this was Maz’s final year of
eligibility and the realization that
maybe Mazeroski’s plaque is not
destined to hang with baseball’s
immortals.

Some 20 years have passed
since liill Ma’/.eroski’s retirement
from baseball. Many fine second
sackers have donned a baseball
uniform since Ma’/.eroski hung
up No. 9 for good, but there has
not been a second baseman since
or before who turned the double
play as quickly or made the most
difficult ground ball into an easy
putout. His fielding ability was
amazing, and his quick release
on the twin killing may never be
equaled.

Yes, it is quite obvious that the
single reason why Bill Mazeroski
is not in the Hall of Fame is
because of his less-than-
spectacular hitting statistics.
However some may forget that in
old Forbes Field the left ﬁeld foul
line was 365 feet away from home
plate.

This damaged Ma’/.eroski’s
hitting stats. Forbes Field damaged
all the Pirates’ power numbers.

Willie Stargell and Roberto
Clemente, who played in both

Nome:
Dote: Starting:

Forbes Field and Three Rivers
Stadium, recognized this. In the
years they played in Forbes Field,
it was commonplace for them to
hit, more home runs on the road
than at home. There is a
discrepancy between the two
parks, and who knows what kind
of offensive numbers Maz could
have amassed if he played most
of his career at Three Rivers or
another hitter’s ballpark, like
Wrigley Field?

Mazeroski’s forté was his
fielding, and there is no disputing
that.

He holds the all—time record for
double plays turned (1,706), not
to mention the fact that he led the
league in assists nine times,
double plays eight times, putouts
five times and fielding average
three times. In total, he led the
league in 55 defensive categories,
and many ofhis assists originated
from his graceful pivot on the
double play.

Maz averaged 492 assists a year
at second, which made it even
more difficult for him to excel in
fielding percentage. '

Still, his .983 average places
him second behind Nellie Fox
among second basemen with
2,000 or more games at that
position.

in reflecting on Maz’s career,
the awards and honors he has
received illustrate what kind of
player he was.

He was named The Sporting
News Major League Player of the
Year in 1960 and The Sporting
News Outstanding Second
Baseman in i962 and ’67.

l-le won eight Gold Gloves and
was an All-Star seven times. Maz
is also the all—time leader in the

vmvtasu V O! PIHSBUIIOH
 

fairly new statistics Fielding Runs
and Fielding Wins.

That may surprise some, but
his placement in another statistical
category probably will shock most
aficionados.

The statistic to which I am
referring is Total Player Rating.
This stat very simply combines a
player's hitting and fielding
statistics and rates that player. To
prove the validity of this stat,
Babe Ruth has the highest player
rating of all time — an astounding
105.1.

Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron, Ted
Williams and Willie Mays round
out the top five. .

The top 100 is loaded with Hall
of Famers and Hall of Famers—to-
be. On this list of the sublime,
Mazeroski ranks 56th.

When arguing on behalf of
Mazeroski, I keep trying to make
the point that defense is an
important part of baseball.

Sure, Mazeroski was not a great
hitter, but the Hall of Fame is not
filled with multi-dimensional
players. '

Babe Ruth was not a great
fielder. He had a lifetime fielding
average of .968 in right field,
which is poor.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out that Ruth is in the
Hall because he hit the hell out of
the ball.

My proposal to you is this: If
the best hitters in baseball history
(Ruth, Cobb) are in the Hall of
Fame and the best pitcher in
baseball history (Cy Young) is
enshrined in Cooperstown, then
why should we exclude the best
defensive player in history? That,
of course, would be Bill
Mazeroski.

Lady Panthers face
Syracuse tonight

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

When the Pitt Lady Panthers
and the Syracuse
Orangewomen face each other
tonight at Fitzgerald Field
House, it will be a matchup
between two teams in very
similar situations.

Syracuse enters this game
having lost five straight after
upsetting the powerful
Connecticut Lady Huskies on
their own court. Earlier in the
year, starting junior center
Holly Oslander went out with
a knee injury, leaving head
coach Barbara Jacobs, no
choice but to start a smaller
lineup.

Likewise, the Lady Panthers
enter this game as the losers of
four in a row after they had
put together two come—from-
behind road wins. The Lady
Panthers had to deal with the
loss of three players (Maureen
McConnell, Shannon Davis
and Jenine Joyce) who have
or could have started. As a
result, they have had to rely
on a first-year player to run
the point.

“We can’t look at this team
and sit back and say we can
beat them because we’re in
much the same situation that
they are,” Pitt head coach Kirk
Bruce said. “We know we’re
going to have to go out and
fight for this one.”

The two squads not only
share similar problems, but
they match up about as well as
any two squads can. Both

teams play with a smaller,

lineup consisting of three

guards and two forwards.
Since Oslander’s exit, the

Orangewomen have started 6-

foot, 2-inch Shawn Ziemba
and 5-10 Taneshia Welch
down low. Ziemba started 11
out of_15 Big East games last
year, averaging 5.7 points a
contest. Welch is only in her
second season of collegiate
ball after coming to Syracuse
via Benton Harbor, Mich.
Bruce said he does not see his
starting frontcourt of 6-Ojonna
Huemrich and 6-3 Carolyn
Miler having any trouble with
their Orangewomen
counterparts.

“Jonna’s not a huge player,
butl think she’ll be able to do
well against Welch down low,”
Bruce said. “She shouldn’t have
any problems there.”

The backcourts of the two
teams match up almost
identically. Syracuse’s Erin
Kenneally, a 5-9 guard, and
Pitt’s Jill Colabrese, also 5-9,
should provide an interesting
matchup. Colabrese has

regained the scoring ability 0

she had earlier in the year.
Kenneally averaged over 10

points a game last year and S

has had to help pick up some
of the slack on offense this
season.
- Orangewoman Charissa
Crouse (5-7) and Lady Panther
Erin‘ Maloy (5-8) are their
respective teams’ three-point
weapons. Maloy went cold for
a stretch this season, but she
heated up this past Saturday in
Pitt’s contest against
Providence College, going 7-
11 from trey land to end up
with 23 points overall. Crouse
shot over .300 from three-point
land last year in Big East games
and has accomplished similar
feats this year. 0 a

Levy classless for shifting blame an assistant

Some pertinent football ops, b-
ball props and (hopefully not) a
Pens forecasting flop:

-Class move of the week:
Buffalo Bills head choker (I mean

, coach) Marv Levy, on his oh-so

intelligent public-relations
decision. Levy fired his defensive
line coach, Chuck Dickerson, for
his tongue-in—cheek quips about
the Redskins’ offensive line. Give
me a break!

Levy’s rationalization that the

success, Mullin and Price fit the
bill.

As for Mullin, the steady
leadership and sparkling play of
the St. John’s University alumnus
has transformed an undersized
Golden State team into a
legitimate threat to win the Paciﬁc
Division. In addition, the play of
Mullin has drawn attention away
from rookie Billy Owens, who is
quickly blossoming into the All-
Star type of player that everyone
expected him to be. Owens had
a career-best, 30-point, 10-assist
game at the Garden on Sunday.
Don’t tell me Mullin’s presence
on that team had nothing to do
with Owens’ brilliant play.

As far as Price is concerned, it’s
hard to imagine a player who has
had a more positive impact on a
team in recent years. Jordan is
definitely king of the Bulls, but
without “Air” the Bulls would Still
win 50 games with Pippen, Grant,
and Paxson leading the way.

Without Price last season, the
Cadavers were lost puppies,
struggling to play .500 ball (40-
42). The Cavaliers stumbled out
of the gates this season at a sorry
1-4 clip. But since Price’s early

Brian
Gallagher

return from a severe knee injury,
the Cavs have won 29 of 38
games. They currently hold down
the second-best record in the
NBA. They won’t beat the Bulls
come playoff time, but with Price
back in the fold Cleveland is
easily the most improved team in
pro hoops. Price can’t dunk and
he won’t stuff Barkley on a
breakaway, but as far as the
importance of a specific player to
the success of a team, there may
be none more valuable than Mark
Price.

-For all those Penguin fans
who are miffed at the team’s
lackluster efforts following a
Stanley Cup championship, don’t
feel so bad. You could be a
Cincinnati Reds or New York
Giants fan. If you look back and
see how those two franchises
followed championship seasons,
you would feel much better about
the current state of the Pens.

The Giants lost their coach, Bill

Parcells, to his enlarged ego
(never to return) and got a coach,
Ray Handley, with poor decision-
making skills and the personality
of a turnpike attendant. They
were unorganized from Day 1
and didn't make the playoffs,
finishing a measly 8-8.

The Reds were even better.
The egomaniacs from the Queen
City got several unselfish
contributions all season — Rob
Dibble’s beanballs and whining,
Eric Davis’ annual pity party, Lou
Piniella’s presence and Marge
Schott’s cheapskating and
babbling. They never even
showed a glimmer of their 1990
World Series selves in 1991. They
finished below .500 in total
disarray. 1

As for the Pens, they are (as of
press time) six games above .500
at 26-20-6 with 58 points — good
for eighth place in the NHL. This
isn’t so bad if you consider the
living hell the team has gone
through.

Had I been told before the
season that the Penguins would
lose their coach to cancer, have
several contract squabbles,
change ownership, endure trade

rumors (of big-time players)
through the course of the year,

have injuries plague nearly every ‘

defenseman and see the return
of Mario's trick back on a day—to-
day basis, I would not think highly
of the team’s playoff chances let
alone another Stanley Cup run.
No way!

Yet despite all this turmoil,
there is still reason to be excited
about this team. If the team gets
reasonably healthy (that means
Mario), quits crying over piss-
poor NHL officiating and plays
strong, two-way hockey, they can
make another run. You may also

take heart in the fact that, come ‘

playoff time, we could face the
Rangers, the ultimate chokers in
NHL history. So anything can
happen.I know the Rangers have
Mark Messier, but Pittsburgh's
leaders far outnumber any team
in the Patrick. Look for veterans
Joey Mullen and Bryan Trottier to
settle the team into strong playoff
form in the next three weeks.

If they can harness the
aggression thatjagr, Stevens and
Recchi are spending on the refs
and direct it toward playing solid
hockey, watch out!

Attention Sportswriters:
There will be at meeting this Sunday at 6:30 p. m.

 

in 434 WPU. Be there.

wide receiver for Pitt’s football
team, has also made IC4A
qualifying time in the 55-meter
dash. According to Vasvary,
Jells will race in that event and
the 200-meter dash this
weekend. Alexander, who like
Jells is a first-year student, ran
the hurdles very well at Notre
Dame, Vasvary said.

Several hurdlers enjoyed
success at Notre Dame.
Alexander finished sixth in the
55-meter finals with a time of
7.91 seconds, and Chris
Douglas placed fifth in the
consolation finals for the same
event

Satu rday’s meet at WVU will
be “one of the largest meets
ever,” Vasvary said. “We’ll have
all kinds of competition and a
good chance to run very well."

Vasvary added that he had
several objectives for the meet,
including trying to get a IC4A
qualifying time for the distance-
medley team. “lt’s a good
opportunity to check other
people out,” Vasvary said. “It
should be a very interesting
and very long meet."

For the women, the sprinters
and jumpers were most

impressive in Ypsilanti, Mich.
Kim Blair set a school record
in the 200 meters with a time
of 28.40. Blair was third in that
event, and teammate Staci
Suggs placed sixth.

Renee Pope grabbed a fifth-
place finish in the 55-meter
ﬁnals (7.4 seconds), and Suggs
earned second place in the 55-
meter hurdles (7.9 seconds).
In addition, Pope was seventh
in the 400-meter finals. Both
Pope and Suggs are first-year
students. Blair ran an 8.3 in
the 55-meter hurdles in
preliminary heats, but her time
dropped to 8.7 for the
semifinals.

The Lady Panthers placed
two long jumpers in the top
five spots. Niambi Daniels was
third with a leap of 18-feet, 1-
inch, and Katina Miles placed
fifth with a 17-foot, 10-inch
jump. Daniels also registered
a sixth-place finish in the high
jump.Two veterans of the
team, Ronise Crumpler and
Monica Hockaday, placed third
and fourth, respectively, in the
400 meters. Stacey
Wyzykowski, the lone senior
on the squad, placed second
overall in the 5,000 meters.

Game

Continued from page 10
Jake Morton led to Shareefs first
three-pointer with 7:07 left in the
half as Pitt began to pull away,
taking a nine-point lead. A running
dunk by Darren Morningstar and
two free throws by Eric Mobley
ran the Pitt lead to 10 points at the
half. -

Despite the turnovers, Pitt's
backcourt controlled the first half.
Sean Miller made some great
passes on the way to five assists
although he had only two points.
More importantly, ‘Pitt seemed to
establish its inside game late in
the half, as Morningstar had nine
points at the half and ended up
with 13 and nine rebounds. The

Panther lead was mostly built on
48—percent shooting from the floor
(50 percent for the night),
compared with 32 percent by
Miami (37 for the game).

The Panthers slowly put the
game out of reach in the second
half. McNeal rebounded a miss
by 6-3 guard Jerome Scott, the
only Miami senior who gets
significant playing time. McNeal
then ﬁred an outlet pass to Shareef
ahead of the pack for a dunk,
stretching the lead to 14.

After a jumper by Scott, Miller
set Morningstar up for a hook.
The move put Miller in second
place behind Sherman Douglas
for all-time Big East assists. Miller

ended the night with eight assists,
bringing his career total to 344.

The lead stayed in the mid-
teens until a Mobley slam and a
three-point bucket by Jerry
McCullough stretched it to 20
with 10:28 left in the half. Shareef
stole a Mike Gardner pass and
took it in for a dunk, bringing the
score to 59-37.

The only remaining excitement
was a near altercation between
Miami first-year forward Ochiel
Swaby and Pitt reserve Brian
Brush with 1:56 left. The result
was a double technical. That
ended the night for Swaby, who
was one of few bright spots for

the Hurricanes with 18 points.

Hoop

Continued from page 12
Morton faces a challenge from
Karen Zajick. Morton has never
played organized basketball
before this season, and the senior
Zajick proves to be a challenge
for her.

The similarities in lineup and
play are seen by Bruce as he
looks at the two teams.

“When I look at them, I see a
team very much like ours,” Bruce
said. “All of the pieces seem to be

there; they just can't seem to put
it together. We’ve been like that
—— just a little bit away from
getting everyone doing the same

thing.”
When these two teams met
earlier this year, the

Orangewomen came away with
a 56-51 victory in a game Bruce
said Pitt could have won.

“I don’t think we played that
well,” Bmce said. “We were in it
at the half, and we held an eight-

point lead. We just let it get away.
We look back at that, and we
know wecould have had that
one.”

Bruce said he hopes his team
can do better than the .396 it shot
from the floor the last time the
teams met and that he sees that as
the key for his squad.

“If we can shoot the ball and
make the shots they give us, we
have a real good shot at this one,”
Bruce said.

showing why he is for real, posting
a 12-5-3 mark with a 2.49 goals-
against average since his extended
contract holdout. But the Chi
Hawks have been banged up
recently, which is why they went
out and got the“coachable” Rob

' Brown from Hartford. Stay tuned

for the match of the Century:
Brownie vs. Mad Mike Keenan.
The Kings are climbing back
into the Smythe race, but their
statistic sheet is amazing. Wayne
Gretzky is a -13. Tony Granato is

the leading goal scorer with 24.

Jarri Kurri has 35 points and is a

-11. Tomas Sandstom has 10 goals.
In fairness to Kurri and Sandstrom,
both have been injured, while

Gretzky missed games during his ’

father’s illness.

This makes this team the newest
member of the Smythe Division
to be a major disappointment.
(Calgary has had the talent for 8
years, but it has only one cup to
show for it.) -

Speaking of the Flames, who
are in jeopardy of missing the

playoffs, consider this: Joe
Nieuwendyk has a measly 13
goals, while newcomer Gary
Leeman has no goals in 14 games
with the Flames, which is one
less -than Craig Berube, with
whom Leeman came over from
Toronto.

Pat Lafontaine has 57 points in
30 games with Buffalo, while
Pierre Turgeon has 51 points in
39 games and Benoit Hogue has
53 points in 42 games for the
Islanders — a trade made in

got absolutely nothing. No‘
penalty; no suspension. The “all-
knowing” league felt this was just
an accident. T

The NHL, however, didn’t
consider it an accident when
Jaromirjagr accidentally bumped
into referee Ron Hoggarth in the
Washington game Hoggarth lost

all control of. jagr got a 10-game 9.

suspension. It amazes me how
Fetisov gets a mere five games for
nearly ending the careers of
Coffey and Lemieux while Jagr
gets 10 games for bumping an
incompetent referee. It seems that
the league is more concerned
with protecting these imposters
in referees’ uniforms than its star
players.

This leads me to conclude that
until the NHL can realize that it
needs new officials or new
officiating policies, there will be
no national TV contract. As a
result of not having this American
television contract, the big
sufferers are the fans, because
ticket prices are going to continue
to go up to compensate for the
money that the NHL isn’t making
off of TV.

So keep this in mind next time
you go to a hockey game and
you’re frustrated about what you
paid for the tickets: Those officials
you see on the ice before you are
part of the reason that your tickets
cost so much.
