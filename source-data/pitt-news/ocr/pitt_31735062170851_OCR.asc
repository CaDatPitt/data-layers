Suit Filed Against Press
for Sex-Segregated Ads

by N. J. BROWN
Pittsburgh's Human Relations

Commission has filed suit against-

the Pittsburgh Press for sex—seg-
regated help wanted advertising.
The case is currently on the U.S.
Supreme Court docket. Z ‘

The Pennsylvania Commission
on the Status of Women has enter-
ed the action as a “friend of the
court.“ in opposition to the listing
practice.

Commission Executive Direc-
tor Arline Lotman said the court’s
ruling could be a landmark deci-
sion in women’s struggle for equal
job opportunity. “The Supreme

it Court now has the opportunity to

eliminate this practice and make
it possible for women and men to
apply for jobs on an equal basis,”
she explained.

The Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commissions 1972 revised
regulations declare such’adver-
tising a violation of the Civil
Rights Act. Title VII. Only jobs
where sex is a definite criteria.
such as "female actress.“ are ex-
cluded from the regulation.

The case against the Press
stemsfrom a complaint filed by
the National Organization of
Women (NOW). In 1970. the Pitts-
burgh Human Relations Commis-
sion. ruling sex-segregated job
listings violated its Ordinance.
Section 8. ordered the Press to
stop sex classification of want
ads. Allegheny County Common
Pleas Court and the Common-
wealth Court upheld the order.

In a statement accompanying
the amicus brief. the Commission
said:

Nominees for
New CAS Decin

Announced

by MITCH BERRY

Acceptance of a new C0ll.\lllU'
tion came at the College of Arts
and -Sciences Cabinet meeting on
Thursday. March 1. as well as dis-
cussions concerning the Search
Committee for a new CAS dean.

After a short discussion. the
constitution. which had been
drawn up by Cabinet members.
was approved unanimously and
sent to the Student Government
Committee for final approval.

New business brought before
the Cabinet came from a group of
representatives from Ideas and
Figures. the student literary mag-
azine. The cabinet was asked to
recommend to the Student Gov-
ernment Board that the publica-
tion be allocated more money.

The group felt that the present
budget for the magazine was in-
sufficient if the magazine is to
become a quality literary maga-
zine. on the ‘level of those publi-
cations being produced by other
universities. .

“Women comprise 51 per cent
of the population of Pennsylvania,
according to the 1970 census. And
they make up 37 per cent of the
Pennsylvania work force. Yet,
because of discriminatory em-
ployment practices, three-quar-
ters of women workers are clus-
tered in. the lower-paying, less-
rewarding service and clerical
jobs. ‘

Deprivation is-"more significant
where women head households.
the Commission report continued.
“Although families headed by a
woman constituted'only 11 per
cent of all families in-1970. they
accounted for 37 per cent of all
poor families. The proportion of
all poor minority families headed
by women was even greater—37
per lcent.“ .

Budget cuts necessitate expenditure reviews i   

Age of Accountability

by JOHM AMSON CAPITMAN

'.‘We are asking every unit of
the University to review their
operations and attempt to run on
a budget that is 94 per cent of
what they have this year." said
Dr. Arlen Elser. Vice—Chancellor
of Planning and Budget. in a re-
cent interview concerned with the
effect of State and Federal cut-
backs on University monies.

"The age of accountability has
come and is being thrust upon us
by our constitutents." said Elser.
"And so we must account for the
use of our resources." _

Elser explained the six per cent
decrease in expenditures as a re-
sult not of a cut in the University’s
money from the State, but rather
because “we have been given the
same amount as during fiscal ’72
and with the present rate of in-
flation this becomes tantamount
to a _cut-back.” A "second cause
for what Elser called “a reassess-
ment of our priorities for expen-
diture” is the impact of the Feder-
al Department of Health, Educa-
tion and ‘Welfare (HEW) cut-
backs on money to educational in-
stitutions. .

The schools at Pitt which will

\be "most effected" by the HEW
cutbacks are the Graduate School
of» Public Health. the School of
Education. the School of . Medi-

Mayor Ccindidacy Discussed

cine. the School of Dentistry. and
the School of Nursing ~— all of
which rely heavily on federal
funding for internships and
trainee programs. ’

Elser pointed out that the Fed-
eral cutbacks "will effect differ-
ent schools to varying degrees.
The Medical School is. for exam-
ple. "not so dependent on federal
funding. while the Graduate
School of Public Health gets 48
per cent of their total operating
budget from the federal govern-
ment."

The Vice-Chancellor stressed,
however, that to his knowledge
“no program will be phased out.”
He also mentioned that “a num-
ber of our legislators are sym-
pathetic to the plight of the uni-
versities so it is conceivable that
new money will become avail-
able.” ‘

Elser discussed some of the
other effects of the cut-backs.
mentioning a "freeze onfaculty
and staff hiring. When positions
are vacated. however. we can ac-
tually take people who are pre-
sently in our employ and re—assign
them internally." so termina-
tions contracts can be avoided.

The Vice-Chancellor was then
asked what this “freeze on fac-
ulty and staff hiring“ would do to
the Affirmative Action program.

  Caliguiri Visits Campus

Less than a week after receiv-
ing the Democratic endorsement
as a candidate for Mayor of Pitts-
burgh. Councilman Richard S.
Caliguiri visited the Pitt campus.
Appearing at ‘the request of the
College Young l)emocrats. he in-
formally addressed» about 30 stu-
dents froin Pitt. Duquesne. and
Chatliain.

Caliguiri. referring to Pitts-
burgh as "my life." reviewed his
record in city government as a
Parks director. special assistant
to the mayor and councilman. In
his race for councilman. ‘Cali-
guiri led the ticket in 1971. Since
that time he has been an active

and involved councilman. attend-

ing. by his own count. "three or
four neighborhood meetings a
week."

He promised a continuation of
this practice of “going to the peo-
ple” and meeting directly with
them to discuss their problems.

In a question and answer per-
iod. Caliguiri dealt with several
important issues. He objected to
the "sacrifices" and “callous fir-
ings" characteristic of the ina-
yor's austerity budget. Caliguiri
claimed that aid to "get Pitts-
burgh moving again" could be soli-
cited from the corporate coin-
munity which Flaherty refuses to
speak to and from state and fed-

,_er'al government ' programs of

. ,~.

 

which the mayor refuses to take
advantage.

Caliguiri was‘ distressed by the
fact that the mayor views the Lim-
versity and corporate communi-
ties as "liabilities rather than as-
sets." Caliguiri explained that
"all faction should be included" in
the governance of this city.

Finally, he was questioned
about the man running against
him, Mayor Peter F. Flaherty.
The councilman objected first to
the mayor’s method of operating
the city, claiming that Flaherty
“has no plans for this city” but
“merely reacts to crisis’ as they
arise.” Commenting on the ma-
_vor’s alibis for the job exodus and
the lack of programs and even
“decent asphalt” on the streets,
Caliguiri declared, “The buck
stops in the mayors office —‘ he
has got to stop blaming others.”

Sizing up his chances in the May
15 primary election. he said that
he and Flaherty have "the same
amount of credibility with the vot-
ers" and he «Caliguiri» does have
 record of keeping his prom-
ises."

When questioned about Flaher-
ty’s personal popularity. despite
the many obvious shortcomings of

his administration. Caliguiri ex-
plained. "He gives them a nice
smile with blue eyes.“ Dick Cali-

Besides these questions of fac.-I-ii'i'-:1

UAR Endorsement Debated

by LINDA SAVAGE
Two proposals advocating a new

 policy for collecting faculty eval-
-’ uations for the Undergraduate

Academic Review were put aside

‘as faculty at the Faculty of Arts
' and Sciences Council meeting de-

*“bated"rrrstead whether they should
_ I officially endorse the publication.

. Discussion on whether they
‘should endorse the publication led

 to a motion by Mike Margolis. po-
3.; litical science teacher at Pitt.
11 which_stated: "The FAS Council
? encourages all faculty to cooper-
,‘ ate in the matter of course eval-
 uation, but it is an activity that
should be carried out entirely by
f the students and not officially en-
Xjdorsed by an academic adminis-
ftrative unit within the Universi-
A.‘-ty. This does not preclude the
 advice and guidance provided by
._','°'__faculty members."
 was defeated five to four.

___i Ron Eskin, student member of

The motion

the board and chairman of the
CAS Cabinet, explained that one
of the purposes of the UAR is to

give the teachers a feedback on
what the students think of their
classes and by passing the motion
in question “you’re saying the fac-
ulty doesn’t care what the stu-
dents think of their classes.”

In the discussion Arthur Tud-
en stated. “I would never use/the
documentation for really sharp
distinctions." but in classifying
a teacher as good or bad he be-
lieves it is important.

Harry Avery. professor and
chairman of the Classic Depart-
ment. suggested that one of the
problems with the UAR was that
it tried to deal objectively with
the evaluation of teachers when
he thought they should be more
subjective. He explained that he
thought the book should be set up
with more comments from indiv-
idual students about the teachers

The original proposals will be
discussed at their next meeting.
One proposal would allow a pro-
fessor the option of having his
class evaluated. If the professor
refuses evaluation the fact would
be noted in the UAR. After eval-
uation, the professor would be giv-
en the option to look over the re-
view and state reasons why the
evaluation was inaccurate. These
statements would also appear in
the UAR.

The second proposal was that

all courses be evaluated and then
the professor be given three op-
tions: It the evaluation be pre-
sented as it is: 2) the evaluation
be published with the professors
comments. and 3) the evaluation
be vetoed by the professor and
this would be noted in the UAR.

Adams expressed her concern
over the impending Whitehead
legislation regulating the licens-
ing practices of the FCC. She said,
“The Whitehead bill would pro-
hibit a minimum qualitative and
quantitative standard in broad-
casting. A competing station or
interested individual could not
petition for a FCC hearing until
the licensed station was proved
in violation of the FCC.”

Adams compared this proposed
process to "a public official not
being elected until the incumbent
was impeached.“

nouncements. According to the
national president. "These ads
developed by women working in
advertising will show the conse-
quences of stressed sex roles and
how the feminist movement at-
fects every aspect of life.“

One such slide shown was a car-
toon characterization of a man
with rolled up pants staning be-
neath the copy, “Hire him. He’s
got great legs.” Another was the
picture of a toddler with its back
facing the audience. The copy ac-
companying this picture read,
“This healthy, normal baby was
born handicapped. She was born
female.”

Heidi commented. these slides
show how society has limited
women’s role and full potential.

Heidi did not accredit the news
media with fair coverage of the
recent NOW conference in Wash-
ington. She said. "Of the 100 reso-
lutions discussed at the confer-
ence only two or three caught the
media's attention. These happen-
ed to be prostitution. rape. and
lesbianism. instead of such issues
as employment. child care. or
-image.

She continued, “If the news me-
dia wanted to cover sensational-
ism why didn’t they emphasize the
28 million dollar back-pay allot-
ment won against AT&T.

Concluding." the press confer-
ence. Heidi stated. "NOW will
continue its efforts to educate
people to a sensitive awareness of
the feminist movement as a hu-
manist movement. Present insti-
tutions deny society full use of all
its talent."

against the magazine. They claim—'
ed the old board told them that
Ideas and Figures was "not tip-

unlair criticism. especially in
light oi‘ the recent sale in which

No decision was reached on the
Ideas and Figures problem. Dis-
cussion moved on to the Dean

due to this upswing in opportun-
ities more companies will be in-

“The opportunities for employ-

Job Prospects Improving

er shortages are predicted in the
engineering field throughout the
next few years. It has been re-
cently estimated that the cotin—
try will soon require ;')tl.0tlll engi-
neers. while there will be only 35.-
000 to till the positioits.

For those who enter the teach-
ing‘ profession "problems" are in
the ollering. The well known
teacher surplus still stands at
close to 3tl0.0()U. For woineit attd
minorities the job picture is con-
siderably brighter. Ilolmack
claims that "it qualilled they
should have no problems.“

Current estimates say that 35
per cent more women will be
hired this year as compared with

last. The engineering _field is es-
pecially open for women and min-
orities. “In all fields,” Holmack
claims, “the opportunities for
minorities are better than aver-
age.”

Opportunities lor summer em-
ployment are "very tight" with
no real or substantial change from
last year's situation. ‘

 Tap Day marked another step in
this year's return to tradition.
One can only wish that it did not
also signify a return to absurdity.
The high‘ point in all of this inane
ceremony was the presentation ot'
certificates to students who were
selected for Who’s Who in Amer-
ican Colleges and,Universities. To
tput ad hominem arguments to
rest. let me point out now that I

{to Who‘s Who although I am not

the Student Affairs Office. After
all. only a few minutes before.
Hurwitz was named Senior Man

extra—curricular leadership." Hur-
witz also was excluded from the
Alumni-Student Leadership Din-

Some traditions are bestdone

Who's Who belong in that class. at
least as long as some of the most
prominent student leaders are ex-

,Critic’s Critique

It was Tom Miles‘ letter to the editor in the March 2 issue of the
Pitt News that drew me back to my typewriter after a long absence.
His article. "Critics "Rocked." brought back some memories for me ._
about the days when I was drama critic for the Pitt News. Although I
have never formally resigned it is common knowledge that I no longer

‘ review for the News.

It was over two years ago that I first wrote a letter such as yours.
Tom. «Editor Miller remembers that we both began our association
with the Pitt News in the same year: he was a freshman and myself a
new graduate student.» I wrote a letter at that time——such as yours.
saying the same things that you have said. I criticized our campus pa-
per for sending reviewers to review theatre when it was obvious that
they knew nothing about the craft. .

It was following that letter that I joined the staff and established a
body of critics for our theater productions. Some may remember Lois‘
Levenson or Chuck Levine who along with myself formed the theatre
review staff. They worked long and hard lea_rning what they were

writing about (both began with a substantial background in theatre). '

For, Tom, my biggest complaint was (as you have so aptly said), “a
critic must not only have good taste, but training in the craft or art
which he sets out to assiess,” Having come from eight years in profes-
sional theater, I was appalled at the Pitt News critics lack of that
which Lois and Chuck worked so hard to attain—a knowledge of what
they were writing about. -

It was not that everyone agreed with us. but we always felt safe in
knowing one thing—-we could always back upwhat we said. We didn‘t
call a strobe a "flashlight that spins" nor did we claim as our only the-
atrical background our last high schoolproduction of. Guys and Dolls.
Many hours were spent in research. Many days. reviewer such as
Chuck. ‘would be sent home to re-check or even completely re-write
what ‘he had written. It was always a nice feeling to hear remarks
or even get letters from our own faculty as well as those from area
theatres telling us that we had written respectable reviews. It was even
better when comments came in the light of an unfavorable critique.
There are still some at Pitt who remember that days when Pitt News
theatre criticism was at least more than a mere comparison with the
late show.

Things changed. Tom. because of the nature of the paper and their
dedication-to the "student who just wants .to write." I am no longer
with the paper because the staff refused to continue to support my
policy ofallowing only those who “passed the test" to review theatri-
cal endeavors. (I do not intend here to belittle anycritic now writing
for the paper but if he or she is good it is beyond me how it can be
more than an accident that they came‘along.i Since my standards were
too high I quietly disappeared. What were they? Simply that anyone
who wrote for the theatre knew something about it. were interested in
good criticism and were productive in what they did. 1

Unfortunately there are some like yourself who (as I.did) find it.

insulting to read and be expected to consume what the paper passes off
as knowledgable authority. Perhaps you discern? It appears that you
do; it would be nice if the paper thought more readers did when con-
sidering all of those areas up for review. ,

Who remembers Art Rosenberg you may ask? I really don‘t know.
Who remembers that for awhile there were a few critics who knew
what they wrote about. There are some who do. I'm sure of it. Per-
haps you will take the same route I did‘? Work hard. sweat. and get in-
volved. You should try to geton the paper and review some concerts
. . . change things. Tom! But don‘t bet any money that things wont slide
back to theway they were..It is inevitable. I hope you do. just to show
them that you can. or better yet. that somebody cares about more than
just "giving everybody the chance to write."

’ Art Rosenberg. Chuck Levine. Virginia Joyce. Dana Ventrigulia.~
even Cindy Morgan send their regards. They cared. tried. and gave a

lot. ljnfortunately. those who have come after them have all but obliter- ,.

ated the last of their efforts. We all get together and cry a lot . . .
sometimes.

“The major aspect is the re-

Braddock.

_ Feminine Forum is a radio talk '
show “for women only" with sex-
..oriented » topics which has be-

come a national craze.
Ballance began the show in 1971

 [during his 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. time

slot in Los Angeles on station

 KGBS. Now Ballance has a num-

,,ber one rating in LA, and a syndi-

‘ g cated, taped, three-hour version

of the program is broadcast in 40
other cities in the «U.S. and Cana-

,WLOA picked up the syndicated
program at the beginning of the
year.

 Although . many complaints

about the show have come to the
station from church and women's
station man-

tics are in the minority.
~‘—‘Like it or not,” said Matta,
“we’re a commercial station. For

I ' 25 years we have been gi-ving our
. ' listeners what we thought.they
I ' should have, and they didn’t seem

 I to appreciate it. ‘Now we give

>fBill Ballance Superstars on Feminine Foru

Matte explained that his family-
owned station has always fought
an uphill battle to survive in the
competitive Pittsburgh market of
24 stations‘. “But recently it has
become a 90 degree plane." The
Ballance show is the "shot in the
arm the station needs.” according
to Matta.

Although ratings will not be out
until May 15. Matta said he he-
lives Feminine Forum has in-
creased the station's listeners.

“A few weeks ago,” helsadi,
“our AM transmitter broke down
for a half hour. Although most of
our listeners are on ‘FM, the
phone never stopped rining with

calls from worried AM listeners’

who wanted the program re-

stored.”

The program format of Femi-
nine Forum is relatively simple.
There is _an announced topic of the
da-y on which women may com-
ment to Ballance. Conversations
are usually brief. lasting nomore

than five minutes. Between calls_

Ballance plays records and coni-
mericials. '

Referring to his callers as "doll
babies." Pkidlets." and “sweet-
hearts." Ballance f.lirts often with
his listeners. _

“I think I love you,” he tells
25-year-old Jeanette who says she
does her housework in the nude.

manship is activated and he leads
his heavily breathing callers down
radio’s lover’s lane—'all by in-
nuendof’ '

"I love you too." answers Jean-
ette. “Let me come over and do
your housework. I‘ll be there with
my little mop. broom. and dust-
cap."

“Never mind the dustcap,” re-
plies Ballance. Ballance claims he no longer
gets complaints from Women's
Liberation supporters because
they have discovered that he is
“very pro-woman."

Another feature of the program
are Ballance’s "half-aphorisms"
such, as "Why. is it homesupun
girls unravel after you marry
them?" or "Parents are the sum
of the squares on both sides of
the family."

Matta maintains. "The guy
iBallancei is simply incredible.
He has been in the business for 25
years and has accumulated a vast
collection of one-liners. He really
does his homework. He is addic-
tive and a delight to listen to." ,

‘‘I‘m in favor of women getting
all they can." he claims. '

Feminine Forum is reported to
be popular with housewives, po-
licemen, salesmen, truck drivers,
and factory workers. About as
many men reportedly listen as
women.

Ballance claims his program is
also popular with college students.

"UCLA and USC have my show
piped into their ‘residence halls
and on their campus buses." he
said.

Matta said Ballance “knows
where to draw the line” so that‘
the program remains in good

Twentieth century French reli-
gious music was chosen by the
Pitt _Men's Glee Club and Wom-
en’s Chorale for this first concert
in March. The performance took
place at Heinz Chapel with Phillip
Cavanaugh conducting. Donald
Biekman on the organ. and guest
soprano Margaret Ross. The se-
lection of composers ranged from
Saint Saens to the more recent
Milhaud and Poulenc.

Each piece offered was very
much a product of our age as far
as complexity of style and techni-
que. Yet. each composer drew
from the vast religious music of
the Gothic and Renaissance per-
iods. The resulting style is one of
restless modern urgency and
search for meaning coupled with
the Christian faith which is part
of both the musical and social her-

for the prisoners as well as man-
kind.

f'I would never do an experi-
ment in man that I would not do
in myself. That‘s a good ethical
standard." ‘ '

Joseph A. Feconda, director of

_, county correctional Services, said

that state is steering clear of
telling local officials medical
research is bad or good.

-"I don't think we havewthe
authority to tell them at the county
they canjor cannot have medical
research." said Feconda. former
warden of
prison. "Were trying to set
guidelines for it and hope it's
administered properly."

Last year, the state sent county
prison officials a protocol out-
lining general considerations for
those involved in research pro-
jects. It’s the same guideline
that was adopted by the American
Correctional Association including
a recommendation that principles
enumerated at the Nuremberg
War Crimes Trial be followed.

Michael Pennock. president of
Techni-Med Inc.. a research firm
experimenting at several prisons.
said many inmates benefit from
the extensive physical examina-
tions used to screen volunteers.

In screening before an anti-
histamine study at Graterford
Prison recently. he said. the fol-
lowing possible ailments were de-
tected; one malignancy. one kid-
ney disease. one case of anemia
and 30 liver disorders.

“Those state people have got
their heads in the clouds,”VPen-
nock said. “The county people
know what they’re doing.”

The only problem is that works
such as these are seldom under-
taken by the non-professional vo-
cal groups for two reasons: the
skill necessary ,for good rendi-
tions of the works, and the lack of
potential for audience attraction.

However. the groups disting-
ished themselves with this per-
formance. For the most part. the
music was handled with a high de-
gree of proficiency.

The program opened with
Faures ‘_'Messe Basse“ and. fea-
tured the Woman's Chorale a co-
pella. The delicate subtlity of this
mass proved to be a wise choice.
for‘it set the solemn mood of -the

number was Poulenes “Litanies

ed to be a_ perfect blend of voice
and instrument.

Both works showed the Wom-
an’s Chorale in a fine light—tech-
nically skilled, but without that
detatched quality I so often find at
many of Pitt’s Music Department
programs. Too many times I have
heard mechanical, stilted per-
formances which may show a fine
musician, but seems to lack emo-
tional involvement at all.

.I cannot give the same praise
to the Glee Club. at least in their
one solo. "Psalm 121“ by Mil-
haud. It was here they lacked that
technical grace with which I have
credited the women. The piece is
in French. and in places I found it
to be rather sloppy. and at times
incomprehensible even while fol-
lowing the lyrics. But. despite

Techni-Med had clearance to
start several projects at state pri-
sons but they were cancelled

when the new ruling came out. .,

Others are going on at county‘
jails. Pennock says he built and
maintains a room at Lehigh County
prison for his experiments.

“A lot of firms are turning to
foreign sources for subjects." he
said. .“We do a considerable amount
of work with students and convents
but we have to watch the drug
taken and some experiments must
be done in a confined atmos-
phere." ’

He claims to pay vol_unteers the
same regardless if they‘re pris-
oners or "free world" subjects. In
one study. Pennock said. nuns from
St. Josepha College in Philadel-
phia received $30 apiece as sub-
jects while inmates at Lehigh
County jail demanded and got"
$35. .

‘_‘We owe an obligation to the
inmates.” he said. “We work

with them and they want the
program.”

He- recalled one prisoner
thanking him for the chance to
participate. That's the only way
Pennock said. the inmate was

able to earn enough money to pay -

the taxes on his house.

these minor flaws. the enthusi-
asm was still there. and this can
always be appreciated.

The three final numbers tea-
tured both groups for "Four Mo-
tets" by Durufle. "O Sacrum
Conyivium" by Messiaen. and
"Three Motets" by Ducasse. The
last of these featured Miss Ross
as soporano soloist. I feel that
these were the finest moments of
the concert. with both groups giv-
ing outstanding performances.

. Here, the men redeemed them-
selves with their crispness, and
the interchange of voices within

' the groups. was splendid. Miss

Ross also carried her solo part
quite well in the Ducasse. Just the
right amountof restraint temper-
ed with the realization of the pow-
er of the soloist. Both solo and
choir handled the parts with an
amount of professionalism which
is pleasing to see here at Pitt.

As for overall .value I would
rate the program very highly —
not perfect. but perfection comes
withexperience and practice, And
if this is the level of Pittfs choral
groups—assuming them to be dy-
namic representatives of this art
in Pittsburgh—.I expect to be even
morevpleased by the next program
of this type.

Sir Doug Sahm was the leader
of the Sir Douglas Quintet, who
did “She’s About a Mover,” one
of the great three-chord songs of
all time, in 1965. Two years later,
Doug and the boys moved from
Texas (to San Francisco, where
they recorded five albums for
Mercury ‘full of fine Chicano-
country-blues material, none of
which sold well.»Now Doug’s on
Atlantic with an album called
“Doug Sahm and Band.” “Band”
is the old quintet augmented by
Dr. John, Bob Dylan, Dave Brom-
berg" (not singing, thank God!),
sax man Dave Newman and others.

It's_ a lot like the Mercury al-
bums. so to me it's a bit samey.
But for most who haven‘t heard‘
much o_f Doug its just fine. Doug
hits all the bases of'Texan music
here. including Charley's Pride's
"San Antone" and the great Bob
Wils tune "Faded Love" heard in
The Last Picture Show. Doug
and Kenny Kosek play beautiful
twin fiddles on both songs. “Deal-
er's Blues" and "Don't Turn
Around" spotlight Doug's R&B~
background.

Dylan and Doug sing "Blues
Stay Away From Me" and Dy-
lan's own "Wallflow‘er.“ “Poisong
Love" features a rocking accor-
dian (yes. accordianw solo by
Doug’s San Antonio buddy Flaco
Jimenez. All in all. it's a”good-
timey record you can snap your
fingers to. and you can‘t do that
with David Bowie. —

When is London Records going
to give up on John Mayall? “Down
The Line” is the umpteenth re-
package of old Mayall since he
moved to the Ploydar label in 1969.
The previous repackage, “Through
The Years.” featured one LP of
previously released material and
one of awfulsounding live record-

ings. “Down The Line” follows

the same pattern.

One record is of cuts from other
albums. competent blues that.
ranges from boring to brilliant.
the finest track being "Hide-
away" featuring Eric Clapton on
lead guitar. recorded in 1965 when
he was one of Mayall's Blues-
breakers. Clapton plays the kind
of searing guitar that some folks.
myself included. feel marked his
most.'brilliant era. Nothing he‘s

done since. Layla'included. has_

this kind of guts. He sounds like
he's tearing his guitar to shreds.

— Record two is actually the in-
teresting one. It features Mayall
and his earliest (1964) Bluesbreak-
ers playing “Louie. Louie" type
beer—joint music in a London
club. The albmu‘s loaded with
tough songs like “Crawlin‘ Up A

Hill." '-‘Crocodile Walk (not rock)."

the B0 Diddley—ish “Chicago Line"
and "Hoot Owl." on which Mayall
sounds a bid juiced; The rhythm
section is tight and his self—con-

scious singing is amusing. I like

this b"etter than the fusion jazz
malarkey he‘s been doing lately.

by BART MACK

It's the same in every sport—
playing to a tie is like kissing your
sister: it‘s just no fun.

Last night at the Alpine Ice
Chalet. the Pitt Hockey Club bat-
tled Carnegie-l\/Iellon to a 2-2 tie
to come one step away from
clinching the City Division of the
Western Pa. Intercollegiate Hock-
ey Association. -

Pitt has only to tie or defeat Du-
quesne next Sunday and they will
repeat as city champs. Last
nights contest brought the skat-
er's record to 11-1-1 in league
competition. Carnegie-Mellon

‘ stands at 9-1-3. in second place

behind Pitt.

It wasn’t enough that Pitt hasn’t
beaten C-MU yet this eason gnd
last night the icers had their
hands full with not only the Tar-
tans, but the referee as well..Ref-
eree James Armstrong should
have been wearing a C-MU uni-
form as Pitt was assesed 30 min-
utes in penalties, including one 10
minute misconduct. _
To start things off. a goal for
Pitt was disallowed midway
through the first period when
ruled that
Browne intentionally‘ kicked the
puck past C-MU goalie Jeff Hart.
Browne. on the other hand. claim-

ed that the shot deflected off his
knee into the net‘ and that he did
not try to steer the puck at all.

-A little more than 30 seconds
later. Pitt made sure that Arm-
strong couldn‘t argue when Phil
Gefsky lit the red light. Gefsky.
playing on the first line in place
of Phil Clarke. picked up the re-
bound of a Billy Glanville shot
and slammed it home. Denny
Browne also received an assist on
the goal. '

"With 4:42 left in the firstper;

_iod and the momentum in Pitt’s
0' "favor, Armstrong staffed the par-

ade to the penalty box. Gary Cum-

a pass to Denny Browne just out-
side the Pitt blue line for a clear
breakaway.

Browne went the length of the
ice unmolested and cruised in on
the. C-MU net. Hart came out
about five feet to cut down the an-
gle and actually got a piece of
Browne's low wrist shot. But the
puck trickled off his left leg into
the crease and Browne tapped it
in to give Pitt a 2-0 lead.

Mike Kenworthy turned things
around 18 seconds later. taking ad-
vantage of the man advantage. His
booming drive from the point hit
Mark Lieberman on his left leg
but deflected through to cut the
lead to 2-1. ‘

The penalty box wasn’t without
a Pitt skater for long after that.
Glenn Hyde and Mike Kohl were
both sent off with less than a min-

Gymnasts Lose to Army

Seniors Shine Through

by LYNN HARRIS

In their final meet of the sea-
son. before the beginning of post
season competition. the Pitt gym-
nastic team did themselves proud.
despite losing the meet against
Army. 154.30-121.95.

Posting a 0-10 record. the team
went into the meet with little con-
fidence as a team but a lot of in-
dividual pride. They showed it
this weekend by scoring more
points as a team than any other
time this season. the result of this
individual self esteem.

Dick Pribis won the floor exer-
cise with a 8.35. Army took sec-
ond and third place. Also compet-
ing for Pitt. Chris Gardner who
did well scoring a 8.00. and Mark
Boyett. a junior. who being out
of competition all season due to
torn ligaments. competed for the

“Mark had a very good come-
back,” commented co-captain El-
liot Sanft.

In pommel horse. Army took
first and second with Cadow scor-
ing a 9.00 and Renne a 8.60. Lee

Dan Campbell posting a round
off back out Vault for the first
time this season won the vaulting
with a 9.15. Army‘s O'Sullivan and

performance as a team all sea-

each squad had been assesed five
minor penalties and Armstrong
wasted no time in giving C-MU the
edge. Joe Testa went off at the
3:47 mark for butt-ending. and
Kerry Browne followed less than
a minute later. V

Once again the Tartans picked
up the two man advantage but
could not score. At 8:44 Cum-
mings went to the box again, and
the Tartans just couldn’t refuse
the offer. Jim Powers, camped all
alone to the right of Lieberman,
picked up the puck after Bob East-""4
man’s shot had deflected off a
skate in front of the net, and pick-
ed the short side corner to tie
the game.

Kerry Browne was called off
once again with 4:10 lef't toplay
and the absurdity of the call an-'
gered him to the point where he
had to be pulled away from Arm-
strong by the two linesman.
Browne was also assessed a 10
minute misconduct.

Pitt plans to file a formal com-
plaint against Armstrong some-
time this week.

Youth has been a main feature of the 1972-73
Pitt basketball squad and an important young parti-
cipant for the Panthers this season has been sopho-
more Kirk Bruce.

Coming off of an impressive freshman year.’

the 6-4. 170 pound guard. wasted no time in break-
ing intothe Cat lineup as a starter. Even in the be-
ginning of the basketball season. Bruce had a feel-
ing that he would be given an opportunity to show
what he could do as a starter.’

"Early in the season I though I‘d get a chance
in a way." explained the Pittsburgh native. "And I
knew that when I got it I had to show that I could
play. When I got the opportunity I just went ahead
and played. that's all."

' Playing on such a youthful team (generally
_Pitt’s coach Buzz Ridl had no seniors in the start-
ing lineup and often had a freshman in there—Tom
Richards for example), Bruce occasionally felt a
little unsure of himself out there on the court.

"Personally I sometimes felt a little unsure out
there." related Bruce.‘ "But even when we had
young players in there. something was clicking in
there. We weren't all that confident but we played
well together." ‘

Bruce‘s own confidence seemed to build as the
season progressed. "Early in the year I wasn‘t play-
ing that much but toward the second half I was and
the more you play the more confident you get.“ he
said.

Throughout the season Bruce’s shooting was
hot and cold and the key to his ability to hit was a
matter of self confidence.

"When I take the first couple of shots and hit I
have more confidence than when I miss.-" stated
Bruce who averaged 7.0 points per game for the

 Pink Prmthers Lose Tri-meet

 

by VICKY VE'l‘ERl:I

l.ast l"i‘i_da_v night the Pill
woini-it's‘ gyiniiastics” teain closed
its season in. a tri-meet tleteat at
the liands of (flarion and Kent
State. 'l'he linal scores were Clar-
ion. H728; Kent. 31:356. and Pitt.
74.510.

l"ilteen girls‘ coiiipeted in each
event. Pitt tailed to capture an_\ ol
the top 12. places for the tour
events. Both Clarion and Kent
have outstanding gyiniiastics
teams. Clarion is tanked sixth in
the l'.S. and Kent is eighth.

ln vaulting. tirst place went to
Betty Cieply of Clarion [who
scored 8.77 on a vainasliita vault.
Second place went to Kent's Mar_v
\\'alker with 8.73. Pat Murpli_\'.
also of Kent. took third witl_i 8.63.
The total team scores in vaulting
were Clarion. 2533; Kent. 25.73.
and Pitt. 20.94.

The highest vault score for Pitt
went to Huldah Jones with 7.40.
Coach Gail DiCicco commented,
“I’m very pleased with the pro-
gress Huldah has made. She only
started with the team this term
and come a long way already.”
Other vaulting scores for Pitt

were 6.87 for Anne Monahan and‘

6.67 for Kathy Krynock.

On the uneven bars. Kent took
first and third places. leaving sec-
ond for Clarion. The scores were
Sheri Moberg. 8.33: Diane Chape-

.la. 7.87. and Betty Cieply. 7.60.

Total team scores were Clarion.
22.00; Kent. 22.99. and Pitt. 14.77.

L)iCicco compared Pitt's bar
performance with that ol the
other teams. "On bars we weren't
even in their league. We didnt
work up to our potential.

“One main reason for our tou-
ble with the bar event this season

is that in the middle of the season
the International Federation of
Gymnastics changed the ratings
of several moves,” continued Di-
Cicco. “Some that were rated as
‘superior’ at the start of the sea-
son were dropped to ‘medium’
difficulty ratings. Therefore, in
mid-season, my girls had to alter
their routines and learn new ‘sup-
perior’ moves in order to achieve
enough difficulty.

"The better schools. like Kent
and Clarion. aren't affected iiear—
l_v as inuchbecause their girls
have mastered enough ‘superior’
moves to make substitution eas-
ier.

"This whole thing has had bad
effects on the girls" attitudes.
.\'ow tlie_v get less points on a rou-
tine and therefore feel that
the_v‘re performing worse."

The Pink Panthers also failed to

Panthers. “But when I wasn‘t hitting I wasn't taking as many shots
and then I was forcing them.

"When I'm hitting I feel I'm getting into the momentum and its
easier to play. It becomes easier to play defense. too."

Youth or no and with or without confidence, the Panthers were able

to come up with a 12-14 record. Bruce, however, does not feel that this
really showed the ability of the squad.

"The team's record wasn‘t indicative of the way the team played

all year." remarked Bruce. “After we lost to Notre Dame we started.

to think of the rest of the way. We had to make that extra step to win
the big games. i

"We got together more on the court—we played together more as
a team the rest of the season." he added.

Pitt will be coming back next season with essentially the same
squad (only Carl Morris and Bill Sulkowski who have seen limited ac-
tion have graduated) and Bruce feels the Cats can come up with a good
season.

"Now we know what we can do as a team." commented Bruce. "ll. ' v

we have a good start well do good——we can‘t help but do better."

And as far as his own personal performance for next season goes.
Kirk Bruce would like "to be a bigger scoring threst—~that would take
the pressure off of Knight and Martin. They've always been the ones to
carry the load for us."
