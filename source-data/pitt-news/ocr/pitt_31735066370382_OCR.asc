Posvar makes annual request for more state funds

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Pitt President Wesley Posvar and
other high administrative officials made
their annual trek to Harrisburg Mon-
day to ask for a larger state
appropriation.

The university has ‘requested a base
budget increase of 15.8 percent over
last year‘s appropriation. Posvar said
the increase is needed because of in-
flation and to improve the com-
petitiveness of faculty and staff salaries.

Conference
held for

Greek
leaders

By Will Young
Staff Writer

Pitt's lnterfraternityi Council and
Panhellenic Association were among

70 universities represented at this past .,
weel<end’s Northeast Interfraternity .

Council and Panhellenic Association
Conference in New Brunswick, NJ.
The purpose of the yearly conven-
tion is to educate the Interfraternity
Councils and Panhellenic Associations

of colleges on important aspects of

Greek life such as alcohol awareness.
hazing and dry rush procedures.

One of the topics that Pitt’s represen-
tatives paid particular attention to was
that of dry rush functions. With the
new dry rush being implemented next
fall. representatives had to converse
with other IFCs to garner ideas and
methods about running a dry rush. One
such program was given by Pitt’s
Assistant Director of Student Activities
Bridget Guernsey.

“My program — Programming
Without Alcohol — was about giving
people an idea on how to market an
idea without putting out a keg," Guern-
sey said. “It covered topics such as
bringing in entertainment. Basically,
giving a type of party in which the peo-
ple don’t recognize the fact that there
is no keg there.” '

With the elimination of wet rush. the
chances of alcohol—related accidents
goes down and thus there is less chance
of a fraternity being held liable for the
occurrence. Fraternity liability was
another topic that Pitt IFC president
Nasos Georgiadis thought merited high
importance.

“I think the most important session
might be the liability workshop.“
Georgiadis said. “A fraternity takes a
big risk if something happens. The
fraternity is responsible if someone gets
hurt because they provided the person
with alcohol. We basically learned how
to prevent mishaps and keep alcohol
abuse down. I'll try and pass this
knowledge down to the individual
houses." I

Georgiadis noted, however, that ac-

Gov. Thornburgh has recommended
only a three percent increase in aid to
Pitt. and that is below this year’s pro-

jected inflation rate.

“The university can continue to
develop as one of the nation‘s leading
public research facilities only if it
receives adequate state financial sup-
port,” Posvar said.

Posvar told the Pennsylvania House
and Senate Appropriations Committees
that Pitt has been an economic
generator and center of growth for the
state since its founding almost 200'
years ago. '

He said Pitt's new Supercomputing
Center is bound to attract computing
and high—tech fimis to the region. Pitt‘s
$100 million research facility in Har-
marville is also expected to have a
substantial economic impact on the
area.

Pitt”s fiscal year 1987 budget request
for an increase is based on the follow-
ing factors:

0 The need to hold tuition at the cur-
rent levels after necessary increases of
19.4 percent over the past two years.

0 The need to increase faculty and
staff salaries so they will once again be

students last night in the Kurtzman Room.

competitive with other schools and
industry.

0 The need to advance programs
such as special student aid, tutoring ser-
vices and career seminars. These pro-
grams help Pitt attract disadvantaged
and minority students.

Pitt's Senate Council recently tabled
a resolution calling for a seven percent
average salary increase for faculty,
because _with only a three percent in-
crease in state funds, it would be vir-
tually impossible to raise salaries seven
percent without a substantial tuition

The university‘s total request of
S1 18.675400 includes a base budget
request of $ 109.575.-100 in support of
general and special educational needs,
including medical and dental education
and $9,100,000 for differentiated
funding.

The $9.1 million would enhance
Pitt‘s research and development
capabilities in a number of areas where.
Posvar said. the university is emerg-
ing into international prominence. The
money would be used for instrumen-
tation and deferred maintenance.

Greek Week begins;

goal set at $60,000

By Dan Bates
News Editor

The drive is on as Pitt’s Greeks take

Dave Hooker/T he Pitt News

to the streets in an effort to collect
$60,000 for Pittsburgh’s needy. The
fund-raising drive is part of Pitt's an-
nual Greek Week celebration, which
began with the Kick-Off event last
Monday.

According to Kick-Off Co-Chairman
Greg Cederlof, the event plays an im-
portant role in the overall success of
Greek Week. “The big thing is that the
event gets those involvediexcited about
going out collecting money, but it also
makes others in the university aware
of and supportive of our efforts," he
said.

“The Kick—Off event essentially
starts Greek Week with a bang.” added
Toby Trosky, Kick—Off co—chairman
after the event. She pointed out.
however, that the most important func-
tion of the event is to introduce the
charity that will benefit from the fund-
raising drive.

This year. the Greeks are raising
money for Helping Hand, a United
Way organization which provides food,
utility assistance, health care and many
other services to needy Pittsburgh

residents. 1

Trosky said the Greek Week Com-
mittee selected Helping Hand as the
benificiary partly because the organiza-
tion helps people nearby. “We know
we are giving money to people in Pitts-
burgh, so we can actually see the
results of our efforts,” she said. “That
makes us feel good.“

Chris Dancu, an over—all co-
chairman of ‘Greek Week, added that
people are very willing to donate to this
charity because they can relate to it.
“Those being helped are often our
neighbors, friends and even relatives."

Dancu said he approached Helping
Hand last summer after watching a
series of stories on WTAE—TV which
focused on many of Helping Hands
experiences with area residents. “We
saw Helping Hand as a very needy
charity, so we contacted them,” he
said.

In appreciation of the students’ fund-
raisingefforts, Helping Hand Chair-
man Dan Rooney attended the Kick—Off
event to say thanks. Rooney is better
known as the president of the Pitts-
burgh Steelers football team.

“I would like to say that we are most

appreciative of your thoughtfulness ,

through caring for the unemployed,”

Women engineers host orientation session

By Leeli Davidson
Staff Writer

Last weekend, Pitt, in association
with the Society of Women Engineers
and the Engineering Alumni Associa-
tion, hosted a two-day orientation for
female high school seniors who have
been accepted to Pitt’s School of
Engineering.

The purpose of the overnight event.
which consisted of engineering lec-
tures, campus tours and a pizza party
was to help the future women engineer-
ing majors decide on a choice of
colleges.

On Saturday. prospective Pitt
engineers listened to lectures by pro-
fessors on various topics in engineer-
ing, including chemical, industrial and

electrical. Lectures were also given by
alumni who represented such com-
panies as the Mellon-Stuart Corpora-
tion, the U.S. Steel Corporation and the
Westinghouse Corporation.

The Society of Women Engineers
provided guidance to the high school
girls in their hectic two days on cam-
pus. At Pitt, SWE addresses the varied
concerns of the female engineer’s life.
It sponsors resume writing workshops,
arranges meetings between employers
and students and also holds holiday par-
ties and fraternity mixers.

At night. after the lectures and tours
were over, SWE hosted a pizza party
for the high school seniors. They
stayed overnight with different SWE
members. One high school senior said
one of the highlights of her weekend
was “a trip to a place called the ‘O’
at 3 a.m. for french fries."

SWE members attempted to give the
high school seniors a positive, realistic
picture of the life of a woman engineer
at Pitt. “I think what we are trying to
tell these girls is that a major in
engineering is worth it," said Lyanne
Hitchens. an SWE member and an
organizer of the weekend event. “As
an engineering student you have to give
up some things. There’s no way you
can go out as much as everybody else.
But it is worth it. and it’s fun too.”

SWE members also addressed the
issue of discrimination on campus. Ac-
cording to some SWE members, the
problems of being a woman engineer
exist more in the work world than in
the academic- one. Said one SWE
member, “I think in the university, at
this time, I feel that we are treated com-
pletely equal. In the work force it’s a
different story. There‘s still a lot of

Whether the SWE members were
able to sway all of the girls towards ac-
cepting Pitt as their future college re-
mains to be seen. Most of the girls said
they were favorably impressed with the
university and many agreed that they
would like to join SWE.

As a result of their visit, some girls
had changed their minds on what field
of engineering interested them. “I was
almost positive I was going to major
in electrical engineering, and now I am
not too sure,” said high school senior
Cindy Janisik.

Some of the high school seniors said
that at Pitt they want to work hard,
make friends and join SWE. One girl
said her goal was to “graduate with de-
cent grades and get a job. That’s about
it."

South Africa - South African Presi-
dent Pieter Botha said he‘ll lift the
seven—month-old state of emergency on
Friday. That announcement came on-
ly hours after a huge blast ripped
through a wall of a heavily fortified
police station in Johannesburg and in-
jured at least one police officer and two
civilians. Police on the scene said the
explosion was a bomb. but there‘s no
official word on the matter as of yet.

Botha also proposed that U.N.—
supervised elections be held in
neighboring Namibia on Aug. 1.
Namibia is a territory on Africa‘s
southwest coast that‘s been ruled by
Pretoria since the first world war,
despite U.N. resolutions calling for its
independence. Botha said his proposal
depends on the withdrawal of about
30.000 Cuban troops from neighbor-
ing Angola.

Disarmament pact

WASHINGTON -— The United
States and Soviet Union are still far
from agreement on ways to reduce their
nuclear arsenals. Moscow insists that
the United States must scrap the “Star

is determined to keep it. The latest
series of arms talks in Geneva will

May 8.

Japan considers
joining “Star Wars”

TOKYO. Japan —— A respected
Japanese newspaper said Japan will

participate in President Reagan’s
missile project which has been dubbed
"Star Wars.“ The story does not say
whether the government or Japanese
private industry would be involved.
Japanese officials deny the story but do
say the government is seriously study-
ing the program.

Marines could
invade Nicaragua

WASHINGTON — The White
House is getting some help in its effort
to gain congressional approval for a
new aid package to the Nicaraguan
rebels. Communications Chief Patrick
Buchanan voiced some ideas of his own
during an interview on the CBS Morn-

ing News. He said that the only alter-
natives to aiding the Contras would be
to let .the communist Warsaw Pact take
over Central America or to "send in
the Marines.“

standstill.

The strike was called in an effort to
force Britain to scrap a treaty giving
the mostly Catholic Irish republic an
advisory role in governing
predominantly Protestant Northern
Ireland. At least 31 people were ar-
rested in Belfast alone, where mobs of
hooded and masked Protestants went
on a burning and looting rampage. A
similar strike in 1974 forced Britain to
scuttle a power-sharing government of
Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland. but British Prime Minister
Thatcher is vowing to stick with the
latest agreement.

Rooney e\plained that Helping Hand

a large sum of money to the L'nited

Helping Hand was created as an official

Inﬂated grades are a modern inven-
tion. They were supposed to have
begun during World War 11. Students
in good standing were exempt from the
draft. so professors began to give
higher grades to those who didn’t want
to go to the front. Grading at Pitt used
to be harder on those at the lower end
of the scale. The calculations went as

follows‘.
A : 3.0
B : 3.0
C‘ : 1.0
l) < 0.0
F 2 -1.0 (or -2.0 at various other

times in Pitt's history)

The 1926 handbook defined what
these grades meant.

"A“ means you have grasped a sub-
ject. thought about it. reacted to it.
made it your own; so that you can give
it out again with the stamp of your in-
dividual insight upon it.

"B" means that you have taken it in
and can give it out again in the same
form in which it came to you. What
you say and write sounds like what the
/\-man says and writes. but the words
come form the book or teacher. not
from you. No B—inan can ever make a
scholar: he will be a receiver rather
than a giver. a creature rather than a
creator to the end of his days.

"C" means the same as B. only that
your second—hand information is par-
tial and fragmentary rather than
complete.

“D“ means that you have been ex-
posed to a subject often and long
enough to leave on the plate of your
memory a few faint traces which the
charity of the examiner is able to iden-
tify. Poor and pitiful as such an exhibi-
tion is. we allow a litnited number of
Ds to count toward a degree.

"F" means total failure. Two Fs

()l‘ficially. Greek Week begins on
Saturday. March 8 with the Greek Sing
talent competition — the highlight of
the week. according to I)ancu. Pitt
fraternities and sororities will also be
competing in a chariot race. a night of
fun and games. the Greek Gorge. the
Greek God and Goddess Pageant and
a dance marathon.

Dancu said he hopes this year‘s
Greek Week helps project an image of
unity and service to the community.
“For some reason. the Greeks have
been picked on recently. so this is a
chance to get away from that." he said.
As for the week of fun and games.
Dancu said. “Greeks deserve to have
fun while going out in the wintery
mornings and afternoons working hard
to raise money."

This year. the Greeks are also spon-
soring a blood drive and are collecting
cans of food for the Hunger Action
Coalition.

End Aid To The Contras

President Reagan is, for the nonce, gloating over the diplomatic
coup his administration bumblingly pulled off in the Philippines.
There would be no harm in this, were it not for Mr. Reagan’s at-
tempt to capitalize on America’s unearned success by bamboozling
the American public with meaningless rhetoric in his campaign
to persuade Congress to allocate $100 million in aid to the Con-
tras in Nicaragua. Mr. Reagan gravely challenged, “We stood for
democracy in the Philippines; we have to stand for democracy in
Nicaragua and throughout Central America and in our
hemisphere.” This parallel is, however, ﬂagrantly fraudulent and
deceptive.

The despot Marcos was deposed by a popular uprising unified
by its outrage against the excesses of the Marcos regime and its
surfeit of human rights violations. But in Nicaragua there is no
such popular movement. The Contras, who subsist almost solely
on the generosity of the CIA and “covert" funding from
Washington. do not represent the will of the people. In contrast
to the Filipino people’s popularly legitimate crusade, the Contras
are but a small, disenchanted guerrilla faction with little indigenous
support. Their cause would surely falter were it not for the millions
of American tax dollars liberally bestowed upon it in the past five
years. '

The Reagan administration claims that the Sandinistas have been
and are acting to subvert the governments of other Latin American
countries and that the requested $100 million in aid to the Contras
would be instrumental in forcing the Sandinistas to take part in
the Contadoran negotiating process. It.is highly questionable that
the proposed sum would be sufficient to prepare the Contras to
force the Sandinistas to do anything. But beyond that, the
genuineness of this argument is in doubt. The Sandinistas have
previously demonstrated that they are more than willing to negotiate
for peaceful settlement in Central America. In 1984, the Sandinistas
agreed to accept a Contadoran draft treaty, but the document was
readily rejected by the Reagan administration. Furthermore, this
year the Sandinistas agreed to a statement of principles that called
for the removal of all foreign military advisers from Central
America, including the feared Cuban and Soviet advisers in
Nicaragua to whom the Reagan administration so vehemently ob-
jects. However, Mr. Reagan continues to refuse to negotiate until
the Sandinistas first agree to negotiate with the Contras.

In Mr. Reagan’s obsessive crusade against the Sandinista govern-
ment, he seems to care not that the Contras aren’t the vanguard
of a legitimate political cause. The political leaders of many Latin
American countries have recognized the legitimacy of the San-
dinista government’s right to power, as was clearly demonstrated
last month when the foreign ministers of eight Latin American
countries visited Washington to lobby on the behalf of the San-
dinista government. It is time that Mr. Reagan does likewise.

We watch it on the evening news.
day after day; millions of children dy-
ing the same tragic way. Some of us
cry. some shake their heads in
disbelieving sorrow. do you wonder
how many people will remember them

In qualifying these few lines from a
song I wrote many months ago about
hunger and starvation in the world to-
day, I find it interesting to note that we
seldom see the desperate, hungry
children on TV anymore — the helpless
eyes which we had come so accus-
tomed to seeing. It is indeed tragic that
thousands of children die day in, day
out —- because it is the norm, it is not
news. For example, imagine our con-
cern. and the attention of the world’s
media were an earthquake to strike San
Francisco, killing 35.000 people in a
single day. Imagine our concern were
a virus to descend on London, killing
18 children a minute without stop,
week after week after week. Imagine

of us a day; 24 of us a minute. 18 of
whom are children.

Despite these astounding figures. the
fact remains that in study after study.
prestigious international commissions
have come to one conclusion: Humani-
ty possesses the resources. technology
and know-how to end hunger. The key
ingredient missing is the will to act on
that ability.

Last semester. we. the students at
Northern Illinois University. banded
together and have raised over $17,000
toward the end of hunger. Our hunger
project took place in the residence halls
(in cooperation with Food Service) and
consisted of over 3.000 students skip-
ping one meal per month and then hav-
ing that money donated to the Hunger
Project. a non-profit. nonreligious
organization whose goal is to make the
end of hunger an idea whose time has
come.

I would like to invite you. the in-

. dividual students of the University of

Pittsburgh. to join us in the fight against
hunger. Be you a senior staff member.
a student or faculty member. I urge you
to organize your own hunger project
for the remainder of the semester or in

time for next fall. Since the media has '

all but forgotten. it is up to us to keep
hunger in the news.

This letter is appearing in more than
80 major college and university news-
papers throughout the nation. If we

stand together. we have a voice of over
two million! Let us sing loud and
strong. “committment generates ac-
tion. and action transforms an idea in-
to reality.“

Unscrupulous
Gimmickry

I was shocked to hear of the Pitt Pro-
gram Council’s plan to sponsor a trip
to Daytona Beach at the same time as
ours at a lower price. but I was appalled
when I saw their advertisement in the
Wednesday. Feb. 26 issue of The Pitt
News.

The full-page ad made a mockery not
only of the ESC-sponsored trip but of
the Engineering Student Cabinet itself.
Implications stating that our trip was
“a cheap imitation.” that one might
end up in a poor location with the ESC
trip and that our hotel accommodations
might be substandard can’t be called
anything less than a stab in the back.

I’m not condemning the PPC’s
Daytona trip itself. It’s a lesson in free
enterprise. and they have the time and
manpower to pull it off. What I am
condemning are their poor advertising
tactics. Leave such gimmicks to Burger
King. They‘re not appropriate for stu-
dent organizations.

Love/ Hate Mail

To Mr. Adam Eisenstat:

I’ve been sitting here. acting com-
placent. for much too long now. And
how typical that is of my behavior.
because now it's gotten to me — I’m
saturated and explosive.

Perhaps I have paid too little mind
to the columns in The Pitt News
previously. Too late to turn back — the
brain damage is done. permanent. I‘ve
absorbed. internalized and choked in
disbelief/rage/enjoyment three times
within the past week. What actual
message I could derive from your col-
umns I perceived as infuriating. ver-
bose and as a "counterpoint" against
an undetermined point. To be perfect-
ly honest —» although I detest admitting
it — I. unfortunately. insightfully know
exactly where you acquired this view-
point. How? I was there. I spent years
in that mindset. One never entirely
emerges from it. but be reminded that
life beyond that rebellious dreamworld
bears little resemblance. How do I
know that? I've made a transition. two
steps closer to that other life. I'm there
now. You'll just have to trust me.

So. you've de-mortiﬁed the Upstage.

“Letters to the Editor:

impeached the common classroom pro-
fessor and tramped through Europe.
Congratulations. If all of these ex-
periences prove demeaning and in-
tellectually worthless for you. then I‘ll
make some recomendations:
1. Don‘t go to the
Upstage.
2. Go to graduate school.
earn your respect, state
your cases intelligently,
do something politically
positive for your cause,
interest. department, etc.,
and in no time, you can —
rise to a first name basis
with your professors.
Another note: If I may
generalize, contrary to
popular belief, they prob-
ably are your superiors.
3. I’m not commenting
upon your foreign or
domestic escapades:
that’s your business.

Beyond my outbursts, I attempt but
cannot restrain my curiosity of why you
write what you do. The curiosity is
sincere. What impact are you trying to
have on your readers? Are you convey-
ing any bona fide messages. or are you
merely “rambling from the depths” of
your creative little mind? Or are you
taking us to the “limits of the
imagination"?

If you choose to respond directly,
don’t even consider the argument that
you write simply to get a reaction. I
believe you are original enough to
avoid the cop-out that has been beaten
like a stable full of dead horses.

What? You‘re asking me why I
wrote this letter? Because I become un-
controllably spastic. grinding my teeth
in silence. in psychotic rage. and I
simultaneously look forward to reading
your works. And I probably wrote this
letter to get your reaction.

Ramblings From The Depths/Adam Eisenstat

Nattering Nabobs Wield Seepters Of Truth  

It was a cold day followed by a cold

night and a cold morning after. I shuf-_

tied up my steps in the breeze. the cool.
unforgiving. anonymous and indif-

‘ferent breeze. And there. there on my

doorstep I beheld it in its shining. aura-
laden luminescence. a scepter of truth.
gilded. no less it was. Who wields
scepters of truth? I immediately cawed
as might a dumbfounded crow after
having an equally incongruous. con-
textless bit 0' reality ﬂung in his bestial
face. Who. indeed. A scepter of truth
is not found upon a doorstep as even
human beings sometimes are. so it has
been said in tales of yore and lore.

Who wields scepters of truth?
Because you know. they are wielded
and brandished and bandied and
bantered. Truth is only a synonym, a
pseudonym. an acronym: a.k.a. power.

dominance and accessibility. Yes. all
and one. the latter most assuredly. Ac-
cessibility. I don‘t think it‘s a good idea
to be anything but accessible in such
highly stimulated (ing). distracted (ing)
times. Andy Warhol once said. "In the
future everyone will be famous for IS
minutes." Prophetic. insightful words.
those. Yes. Me? I want to make my 15
minutes count. certainly enough to
keep from the bad company of such
foul and ominous abstractions as
"everyone." Certainly enough to
cadge another I5 slot from the arbiters
of such precious time. Ahem. To the
point. yes. The point is, and many have
goaded. prodded and bothered me in
a number of blunt ways about this
point: Why. why are you wasting words
when you have a time span. a clock.

The Luck Of The President

"Never eat at a place called
‘Mom’s’; never play cards with a man
called Doe.‘ and never make love to
a woman crazier than you are." So
goes an old American adage on some
of the eternal verities. One of those
verities is about to change. though. I.
for one. would never play cards with
a man called Ron.

Doc Reagan has done it again. After
figuratively putting an arm around the
shoulder of Ferdinand Marcos. dis~
patching his vice president to slobber
a toast to nonexistant Filipino
democracy. suggesting the opposition
and the government were equally to
blame for fraud and violence and then
—— tick. tick. how the clock doth tick
— waiting until only he and Marcos
shared the same vision of the future.
things turned out splendidly. When the
president turned over his cards. there
was Cory Aquino. mellow in yellow.

smiling up at him. He had won again.

In the recent issue of Foreign Af-
fairs. Michael Mandelbaum writes
about “The Luck of the President.“
Mandelbaum counts the ways. Soviet
leaders kept dying. making it hard —
or harder —— for Ameriea‘s chief adver-
sary to be creatively adversarial. The
president came into office campaign-
ing against the SALT II treaty and then.
lo and behold. realized that it was a
good thing after all. It is a lucky thing
to discover the uses of something you
were once willing to throw out.

In the Middle East. the president‘s
peace initiatives have been spectacular
failures. but it hardly matters. The
Israelis and the Arabs make no war
anyway. The price of oil. once sky-
high. fell during Reagan’s tenure and.
-more recently. has plummeted. For
Reagan. there is effect but no cause.
He had nothing to do with it.

Well. Peter Fonda said it so very well
in “Easy Rider." in that spacy. dead-
pan. ofﬂiand manner he used through-
out this timelessly dated celluloid gem:
"Hey. I'm hip to time. but I gotta go."

But who wields scepters of truth?
Me? Ehhhhh. give or take a gilded
layer. Who wields scepters of truth?
Nattering nabobs wield scepters of
truth. Pieces of whimsy. fragments of
history. nattering nabobs wield scepters
of truth. Books without writing. rooms
with no lighting and nattering nabobs

did next to nothing. The bloodshed that
accompanied the elections might have
been avoided had Reagan and the
United States not suggested to Marcos
over the years that he could. literally.

United States at its word.

those people for whom democracy is
not a slogan. but a conviction. It is
doubtful today that they would give our

got in Grenada.

In the Reagan imagination. the foe

latter—day Gandhi. whose dreamy but
misguided efforts are always doomed

cidents are rare at Pitt and that no really
serious ones have occurred despite the
risk.

"Even though the risk exists." he
said, “nothing has happened here at
Pitt. We've had no seriousaccidents.
This is due to the fact that open parties
here are run moderately and kept under
control."

Problem solving, and more impor-
tantly, problem avoidance were com-
mon topics discussed in the various
seminars. One covered how a frater-
nity should handle emergency situa-
tions such as if someone was killed in

an accident because of being intox-

icated at a fraternity party. Another
topic covered sexism in regard to
fraternity treatment of women.

“That program tried to make people
more aware of certain things that could
be offensive to people,” Guernsey
said.

“Pitt doesn’t have that problem,”
Georgiadis said. “There seems to be,
somewhat, a feeling of chivalry here
because fraternities here provide
escorts for women after parties late at
night.”

Hazing also received a good deal of
scrutiny during the conference.

although this is also a problem
Georgiadis believes doesn‘t exist to any
extent.

“Major hazing incidents don't ex-
ist.“ Georgiadis stated. “Not only are
they against the law but they are also
prohibited by IFC regulations. Most
national chapters have passed anti-
hazing regulations.“

In order to safeguard the IFC’s anti-
hazing policies. the IFC has brought up
a motion that would create a Junior In-
terfraternity Council. The council
would keep tabs on the treatment of
pledges. The Junior IFC would be run
totally be pledges under the supervision
of the Internal Vice President. Its main
purpose would be to promote the frater-
nity spirit between pledges and give
them experience in IFC procedures.

The Junior IFC would also be a
forum in which pledges would be able
to discuss hazing incidents and bring
it to the attention of the IFC. The main
problem with hazing, Georgiadis said,
is that pledges are afraid to talk about
It.

“I think this is a positive step,”
Georgiadis said. “It will give pledges
a better idea of how the IFC works so
they can assume the responsibility
when they become brothers."

John C iardi will make his second
appearance with the International
Poetry Forum in a program of
readings from his translation of
Dante’s “The Divine Comedy"
and his own poetry at 8 p.m. on
Wednesday. March 5 in Carnegie
Lecture Hall.

Poet. translator. teacher, Ciardi
manifests a diversity that ranges
from his own poetry to children's
verse to his translation of Dante’s
“Divine Comedy.” His first book
of poems, “Homeward to
America” appeared in 1940. Ciardi

Poet to read at forum

is the author of several books of
literary criticism. including “Mid-
Century American Poets" and
"How Does A Poem Mean?"
Retired to Key West, Fla., Ciardi
Continues to lecture around the
country.

In his introduction to the 1977
Norton Edition of "The Divine
Comedy" (dedicated to Archibald
MacLeish), Ciardi wrote: “Dante
must be read attentively; mind will
reveal itself only to mind. But
Dante is not difficult to read. It is
true that he writes in depth and on

many different simultaneous levels.
Yet his language is usually simple
and straightforward. If the goal of
Dante runs deep. it also runs up to
the surface. A lifetime of reading
cannot mine all the gold; yet
enough lies on the surface, or only
an inch below, to make a first
reading a bonanza in itself.
Thereafter, one need only follow
the vein as it goes deeper and
deeper.”

reading, call 621-9893.

Posvar said two fields which can at-
tract industries to the state are
biotechnology and materials science.
He said Pitt’s biotechnology and
neuroscience programs are “poised for
national and international pre-
eminence,” and they should bring a
tangible return on the state’s investment
in the form of marketable ideas and
products.

With the newly acquired Supercom-
puter Center. Posvar said Pitt has the

potential to emerge as an international
leader in materials science. Materials
science helps existing industrial pro-
cesses by making advances in
polymers, ceramics and composites to
replace metals in certain applications.

Gov. Thornburgh proposed that
$1.94 million be appropriated to fund
the special program in biotechnology

and neuroscience, the first time the
governor’s budget included a recom-

mendation for differential funding.
Posvar urged the legislature to consider
the larger potential return to be gained

Women join march
for safe birth control

By Nadia Moritz

Features Editor

The women’s movement in the 1980s
has been one of many political factions
to suffer as the growing tones of col-
lege conservatism contine to freeze
campus activity across the nation.

The effect of the nation’s fundamen-
tal backlash. many feminist leaders say.
has forced the movement into a pro-
found paralysis. and the failure to
mobilize the young generation of col-
lege women, who are taking for
granted the rights that were won in the
‘60s and ’70s. has added to this
stagnation.

The University of Pittsburgh, which
has developed a reputation of conserva-
tism in student activity. has shown lit-
tle activity in support of the women‘s
movement since the 1970s.

For Julie Hunt. the coordinator of
Pitt's Campus Women’s Organization.
this inactivity is frustrating.

“Sometimes it's difficult not to get
angry and discouraged.” said Hunt.
“It‘s all this conservatism. It‘s en-
couraged by the Reagan administration.
and it is perpetuated by a lack of
‘education. '

“A lot of women think that things
are better today. They think that
women do not suffer from discrimina-
tion anymore. But they don't know the
truth." said Hunt. “Women are still
earning 61 percent of what men are
earning for the same exact work. if that
doesn’t tell them something. I do think
things could change with education.
though.”

According to Hunt. March 9 could
be the beginning ofa trend in women‘s
rights education. Women‘s rights ac-
tivists representing Pitt and other cam-
puses and organizations around the
country will be meeting in Washington.
D.C. for the March for Women’s
Lives. This demonstration will kick off
a week of public activities in support
of women's rights and freedom of
choice. The expected participation on
Sunday is 100.000 marchers. 500 from
the Pittsburgh area.

At Pitt. Hunt and the newly approved
Campus Women‘s Organization have

been involved in campus conscious
ness-raising efforts for the last two
weeks. drumming up physical and
social support for the march.

“The issues that we are confronting
in this march are especially relevant to
college women.“ said Hunt. “Take
birth control. for example. Without that
right. the lives of college women would
be a lot different. and a lot more
limited."

With the Reagan administration‘s in-
creasingly stringent policies on birth
control and abortion, these issues have
become among the most pressing con-
cerns facing the women’s movement in
1986. The March For Women’s Lives
is an attempt to communicate the
seriousness of these concerns to the
public and the legislators.

“We want to show the government
that the majority of the people in this
country will not stand by while the right
to safe and legal birth control is taken
away." said National Organization of
Women Vice President Sherri Odell.
during a visit to Pitt last month.

The continuation of safe and legal
birth control is one of the major em-
phases of the march. According to Flo
Black. a coordinator for the March for
Women's Lives in Pittsburgh. the
issues and rights surrounding birth con-
trol in the United States have reached
the point of crisis. ’

"The Reagan administration has per-
sisted to threaten women‘s right to safe
and legal birth control,“ she said.
“They are still fighting us. doing
everything they can to push women‘s
rights in the other direction. and it
would not be difficult to go
backwards.”

The stance that the Reagan ad-
ministration has consistently taken on
the birth control has been optimistic.
but somewhat ineffective. Their efforts
have been concentrated in the area of
decreasing sexual activity instead of the
pregnancy rate. But as Black said.
“Prohibition didn’t work for alcohol:
it will not work for sex.“ And it hasn't.

The teenage pregnancy rate in the
United States has reached epidemic
levels — one million pregnant teens a
year. The illegitimate birth rate in this
country is about 50 percent higher than

 

in any other developed nation in the
world.

What has the Reagan administration
done‘? Over the last five years. they
have successfully cut the funds for
prenatal care. child nutrition. and have
made threats of eliminating family
planning funds entirely. Under the
Gramm—Rudman Act. there would be
another 4.3 percent cut in family plan-
ning as well as other health and
domestic programs.

As a result. the number of family
planning centers has decreased and
birth control and safe abortions are
becoming increasingly unavailable.
Also. the increased amount of disre-
garded national violence aimed at
women's health clinics has induced a
reduction oftheir facilities. In Oregon
in December 1985. for example, three
letter bombs were discovered by postal
security. addressed to the women’s
clinics.

“When there is terrorism abroad. all
the president‘s men trip over each other
trying to get in front of the TV
camera." said Odell. “There is ter-
rorism in our own country. and we
don't hear a peep. And the victims are
women. That is how much they care
about your lives."

And although abortion was legalized
in 1973 through the Supreme Court
decision of Roe vs. Wade. the avail-
ability of this service is being slowly
decreased.

“Although it is the law of the land,
the access to abortion is extremely
limited.” said Black. “A lot of women
still do not have access to abortion.”

A more direct threat to the legal right
of abortion is the anti-abortion Tauke-
Sensenbrenner Amendment. which was
attached in the House to the Civil
Rights Restoration Act. The act has not
yet been passed.

The threat to the right of birth con-
trol. according to Black, poses a special
concern to college women. "If women
lose their right to control their own
reproduction in a safe way. then for
most women. all the education in the

world is not going to enable them to y

do what they want to do in their lives,
because they are going to have
unplanned pregnancies."

Staff Writer

It’s that awkward moment that
everyone who has ever gone on :1
date must face sooner or later.
Questions such as. "How much
should I offer?" and "What does
he or she expect?" ~ run through
your mind. Finally. one of you
makes the first move — your hand
reaches across. your eyes focus and
you pick up the bill. In an instant.
with one swift move of your hand.
you've cleared one of the many
hurdles that today's dating game
presents a who pays.’

Traditionally. without question.
it has been the male who took the
initiative when the check arrived.
Bttt with the advent of Women's
Liberation. the era when men were
always expected to pay is slowly
disappearing. This expectation has
since been replaced by a number of
notions ranging from “Both sides
are under equal obligation to pay
their own way." to "The one
who‘s done the asking should pay."

But. despite the changing sexual
mores. it is clear that many men
and women still expect the man to
pay. particularly on the first or sec-
ond date.

“I still think the guy should
pay.“ said Rick Platt. public rela-
tions person for Pitt's Inter-
Fraternity Council. “I think the guy
should call. and the guy should pay.

If the girl asks. then maybe she
should pay. but I still believe in
chivalry."

"As far as dating goes. in a
sorority. we ask guys to the for-
mals." added Li/. Habib. Internal
Vice President of the Panhellenic
Association. "If we ask a guy. we
pay for everything. We pay for our
dress. our shoes. his ﬂower. If the
guy offers to help. I don't refuse."

“I was always taught that
the guy‘ s/tould pay. That ’s
the way Ida it. Women want
to have rights — they want to

when it comes time to pay the

"I was always taught that the guy
should pay." said Carl Barker. a
senior engineering student. "That‘s'
the way I do it. Women want to
have rights — they want to be equal
with men. Then when it comes time

The lack of campus activity and con-
cern in support of women‘s rights. ac-
cording to Black. has a lot to do with
taking their privileges for granted.

"Perhaps you feel a little too
secure." she said. “With my genera-
tion. it was the right to vote that we
took for granted. This generation is tak-
ing for granted their equal employment
and birth control rights. We want you
to know that these rights are under con-
stant attack."

their mothers and grandmothers had to
go through. just to gain the right to a
college education,“ said Mary Hamler.
who is the major organizer for the
March for Women‘s Lives at Pitt. and
works in the women's studies program.
"They do not realize that women were
not always allowed into the univer-
sities. "

Hatnler does not feel that the lack of
women’s rights activities at Pitt. or on
college campuses across the nation. is
an accurate reflection of the activity‘

 who pays the check?

what is seen as the standard "din-
ner“ date of the '80s. Dating on the
campus of the University of Pitts-
burgh may mean going to one of the
many local drinking establishments
or to a student movie night or a
sporting event. Dinner is not usual-
ly the case. Thus. different stan-
dards must be adapted to decide
who pays for the drinks or the
tickets. Not quite so much money
is involved.

“People don't date. really.
around Pitt.” according to Habib.
“I’ve been to other universities
where the guys seem to care more.
but no one really goes out on a for-
mal date around here."

Gale McGloin. director of the
Oakland Women’s Center. sug-
gested a few ways in which college
students view this informal type of
daﬁng.

"You pay as you go. That‘s how
it‘s been since my time in college
>~ the late 605. early '70s.“ said
McG|oin. “You do what you want.
If people are really financially
strapped. then you pay for
everything. But for the most part.
ifyou have it. you pay; ifthcy have
it. they pay."

“The basis should be whoever is

men were better off financially. so
that’s why they paid. But all that's
changed now. Sometimes if you
have a little extra money. you take

your friend out to dinner. It just
depends on your situation."

Occasionally. the traditional
evening dinner date will occur.
Everything goes well. and the man
pays the bill without blinking an
eye. Now comes a final considera-
tion concerning dating — "What
does he expect?"

Many women believe the old
assumption that. if the man pays for
dinner. the woman is expected to
pay them back insome way —
usually having something to do with
sex.

“If a man actually asked you out
on a formal date. then that must

mean he is really interested in get-
ting to know you better.“ said
Habib. "If he wants to get to know
you. he won‘t expect anything yet.
But ifit's a different situation. and
the guy asks you to a party or a bar.
then that may be a different story.

“Personally. I don‘t feel I have
to reciprocate.“ continued Habib.
“Some guys just like to spend
money. If a guy asked me out to
dinner. I‘d never have a penny in
my purse. Some girls might feel

"Look. food does not equal sex:
a movie does not equal sex." said
McGloin. “They are two totally
different issues. The girl shouldn‘t
think that the guy will expect
anything."

There are a number of alter-
natives readily available to facing
the situation of "who pays.“ One
of the easiest ways is to take advan-
tage of one of the many cost-free
opportunities offered by the city.

“Dating doesn‘t have to cost
money." suggests Habib.
“Especially around here — there is
so much to do that doesn‘t cost a
thing. There‘s the museum or
downtown. A guy could even take
a girl to a frat party and it wouldn’t
cost him anything."

If you're looking for an exact
answer to the question of “Who
Pays?" — there is none. For those
looking for guidance. there is
always "Letitia Baldrige’s Com-
plete Guide to Executive Man-
ners." In her book. Baldridge sug-
gests that if a woman asks a man
on a date. she should pay
everything — including parking or
taxi charges and coat check. On
subsequent dates. the other person
should at least make an offer to
share the costs. According to
Baldridge. it is up to both parties
to decide if the old sexual order
should reassert itself. ‘'It‘s an equal

level of the group on the whole.

Hunt feels that the campus inactivi-
ty can change with a little educational
encouragement.

According to Black. the change in
activity has already begun. “Ellie
Smeal [president of N.O.W.] has been
speaking on campuses and has run into
a lot of enthusiasm. If that is any in-
dication of the level of concrete activi-
ty. we‘ll have to find out." said Black.

“I think the young people need to
decide for themselves. They have the
knowledge available to them. It‘s all
part of the learning process."

The March for Women”s Lives has
already begun to act in an educational
capacity. according to Black.

"It's making everyone look more
closely at the problems. and it starts
raising some other questions. It helps
people wake up."

Reservations for the March for
Women's Lives will be accepted at the
women's studies department at Pitt
through Thursday. March 6. Call

STOW CTOTCTCTCTU

Photographer uses work to clean

By Lisa Barndt
For The Pitt News

After climbing eight flights of steps
and scaling two sets of ladders. Herb
Ferguson finally attained his goal. It
was a clear night from the roof of the
Fort Pitt Tunnel Building, and Herb
Ferguson was ready to “shoot." The
lights shining from the city. reﬂec-
ting off the river, enhanced the
already stunning view of the Fort Pitt
Bridge.

With his camera in hand, Herb
Ferguson photographed an aerial
view of the Fort Pitt Bridge. “It’s the
first thing people see when coming
to Pittsburgh,” said Ferguson. “I've
been wanting to get that shot for some
time now.”

Out of all the photographs Fer-
guson took of the Fort Pitt Bridge that
evening, one was chosen to be in this
year’s “Pittsburgh Events Calen-
dar,” along with 12 other
photographs taken by Ferguson.

The Fort Pitt Bridge photograph is
the first picture of the year, filling the
January slot. It is also Herb
Ferguson’s favorite photograph in the
calendar. As he explained. no one has
ever done a photograph from that
view before.

Herb Ferguson, photographer-
producer at the University of Pitts-
burgh Communications Center, was
selected to take the photographs for
the Pittsburgh Events Calendar for
1985 and 1986.

“Last year they went over well,
and this year they went over super,"
said Ferguson.

   

Approximately 16.000 calendars
were printed for 1986 and all of them

b have been sold. There may be a sec-

ond printing.

Ferguson has gained national atten-
tion for his photography in the Pitts-
burgh Events Calendar, also named
“Pittsburgh Pleasures.” There have
been inquiries about the calendar
from practically every state in the
country. The technical quality of the
photographs and the viewing of Pitts-
burgh through Ferguson’s eyes has
been acclaimed by many.

"Yes, 1 promote Pittsburgh." Said
Ferguson. “As an individual I’ve
done more than anyone I know."
Besides taking pictures, Ferguson has
done a multi—image slide show to pro-
mote Pittsburgh, and has shown it
hundreds of times throughout the
United States. It was also shown in
West Germany at a branch office of
Mellon Bank to display the city where
the bank’s home office is located.

“Pittsburghers are their own worst
enemies,” explained Ferguson.
“They downgrade the city too much.
My daughters do the same thing. One
lives in Indiana, and the other in Ohio
now. Both feel that there is nothing
here and nothing to do.”

But this is far from the truth, ac-

cording to Ferguson. “Pittsburgh is
a photograph heaven and there is lots
to do and so much to see,” he said.
“There’s the Folk Fest, the Arts
Festival, Hidden Valley, Seven
Springs, Falling Waters and so much
more.

“Pittsburgh gets the rap from

The Pitt News, March 5, 1986

everyone. not just Pittsburghers.“
said Ferguson.

The problem rests in how the city
is portrayed. according to Ferguson,
The image that people have of Pitts-
burgh is of a smoky city. It is depicted
as very dreary. gloomy and polluted.

"When it comes to pollution, com-
pared to Denver, Colo. or Phoenix,
Ariz., Pittsburgh has a low pollution
level," asserted Ferguson. “Pitts-
burgh is very clean now. It’s a neat,
bright and cheery city, and that‘s ex-
actly what I try to get across through
my photographs of the city.” The
Pittsburgh calendar conveys the im-
age of a sparkling, sunny city rather
than a dismal one. ‘

“I try to make Pittsburgh look like
a neat place, because it is,” said
Ferguson. On one occasion, he said,
a woman called from Monterey,
Calif. and wanted to order a calen-
dar and to inquire about other
photographs taken by Ferguson. "My
God. you live in heaven," heitold
her.

She replied,“Don’t believe that,
you don’t know how lucky you are
to live in Pittsburgh.”

“I thought that was neat,” said
Ferguson. “People do not realize

how beautiful Pittsburgh really is,
especially with all the negative im-
ages conveyed to them.

“Being a native of Pittsburgh, I
have been photographing scenes and
events of the city and surrounding

an avocation as well as a vocation.
The guys think I’m nuts.

"They think of it as a job, but I
love to take pictures.” Ferguson has
one of the largest photograph collec-
tions in the area. It contains over
20,000 photographs, mainly of Pitts-
burgh and western Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh’s scenery is a major fac-
tor contributing to Ferguson's
preference for landscape and ar-
chitectural photography. He also en-
joyﬁgierial, micro and news/publica-
tion‘ photography. “I’m not a people
photographer,” explained Ferguson.

Ferguson’s interest in photography
began while he was in the Army.
While experimenting with picture
taking. a friend suggested that he go
to school to study photography. “My
first thought was — where would I
go, and why? The only image I could
conjure up of a photographer was that
they either took pictures of kids or
worked for a newspaper,” said
Ferguson. “I didn’t think of the
thousands of other jobs in the area of
photography.” He ended up going to
Ré€.iester Institute of Technology to
obtain his bachelor’s degree in
photography.

After RIT, Ferguson attended Penn
State and majored in zoology. Upon
receiving his degree, he decided to
attend the University of Miami for
graduate study in zoology. These

image

plans were interrupted when he was
drafted.

After his military service.
Ferguson worked for Alcoa for four
years doing motion picture work. He
was then offered a job at Children’s
Hospital as their photographer. This
was short—lived; the Medical Center
at the University of Pittsburgh asked
him to be director of the Medical
Media Department. “I had 13 peo-
ple working for me and stayed with
the department for 16 years,” said
Ferguson. Then, in 1978, all the
photography departments at Pitt

- merged to form the Communications

Center at Hillman Library. “I’m
known as photograph—producer at the
center,” he said.

Traveling and taking pictures are
passions of Ferguson’s. “I’ve been
to every state and practically every
city,” said Ferguson. “Anywhere I
go, I take lots of pictures.”

Two years ago, Ferguson traveled
with Pitt’s Semester at Sea program.

They traveled to Brazil, South Africa,
Kenya, India and many other coun-
tries. “I took about 10,000 pictures,”
he said. “It was quite an ex-
perience.”

Ferguson also went to Poland in
1979 and took over 16,000
photographs in two months. “We
made it in just under the wire,” he
explained. “Solidarity came in about

1980.” Out of the thousands of pic-
tures taken, 2,400 were used to pro-
duce a show. The title of the multi-
image/multi—media presentation is

:§' ‘

“Polish Phoenix.” The project was
undertaken to promote an awareness
of Po1and’s rich history and culture.
It may well be the largest photograph
collection of Poland in the world.

Besides traveling and taking pic-
tures, Ferguson also enjoys outdoor
activities such as hiking, camping and"
skiing.

“I like to do physical things to get

away from this,” said Ferguson as he
looked around his office. His office
was filled with photography equip-
ment, ﬁles of slides, memos covered
his desk, and photography awards
were displayed on his bulletin board.

Two years ago, Ferguson worked on
a medical film called “Joys of Vi-
sion,” which explained the process
of corneal transplants. The film won

Rssell Kierzkowski o the P‘i_t_t.b’t)-olzsto an otographer Herb Ferguson (1 splayithe

(October of ’85). In the international
competition held in Parma, Italy, the

, ﬁlm won an award. “A friend also

showed the film to the Pennsylvania
Academy of Ophthamology and it
won another award,” added
Ferguson. He will be recognized for
the work at a banquet in Hershey, Pa.

”Poe in Person” is nothing less than
brilliant. Conrad Pomerleau powerfully
transforms the literary genius of Edgar‘
Allan Poe into a stunning and luminous
performance during his one man show.”
Janice E. Clark, Daily Local News
Chester County, PA

”. . .what Mr. Pomerleau has done for all
of us is to recreate the poetry of Poe in
such a way that the writer himself I think
would be proud, and that definitely does
give a new dimension and a new
understanding of America's truly greatest
innovator in the art of poetry.”

”Pomerleau’s portrayal of Poe journeyed
beyond mere acting. He allows himself to
dig into Poe, the individual, and becomes
an active reincarnation of the Poe spirit
which is made complete by their uncanny
resemblance.”

Evelyn Parker, SanFrancisco Post

‘The Pitt News. March 5. 1986

Sports Editor

Stranger things have happened. It
was only last year that Pitt demolished
Villanova in the regular-season final at
Fitzgerald Field House. 85-62. A week
later. Villanova sent an overconfident
Pitt team home after the first round of
the Big East Tournament. after winning
a 69-61 victory that started the Wildcats
on their way to a national chain-
pionship.

It was only four days ago that
Georgetown humiliated Pitt in the
regular—season final 93-62. The Pan-
thers face the Hoyas in the first round

"of the Big East Championship tomor-
row at 3 p.m. at Madison Square
Garden. The stage is set.

The Panthers already defeated
Georgetown once this year 80-76 on
Jan. 2. Georgetown head coach John
Thompson is well aware of how im-

pressive the Panthers have looked at

times.

"It does concern me.“ Thompson
said. "You expect that from a young
team. Roy [Chipman] has got a lot of
talented kids. and talented kids are
harder to coach because they tend to
want to express themselves. The less
talented kid is easier to indoctrinate.
When you have the kind of talent Roy
has. it is doubly hard." He added.
“Any day. when they decide that they
are going to put this thing together.
they can come out there and be a total-
ly different team.“

9 That is what Pitt coach Roy Chipman
is banking on. He has seen his Jekyll-
and-Hyde squad reach both extremes
in his last season as a basketball coach.
The Panthers hit the high—water mark
with the win over Georgetown. but
soon began to sink with losses to Seton

Hall. Providence. Connecticut and
finally. the embarrassment at
Georgetown on Saturday. He has left
it up to his players to salvage a season
that was filled with so much promise
in January.

"I don’t know what is going through
their minds.“ Chipman said. “I hope
that they feel they have something to
prove. and they show a little pride.“

It may take Pitt's best effort this
season to knock the Hoyas out of the
tournament they have ruled for the last
several years. Georgetown is led by
five seasoned veterans. including four
seniors. guards David Wingate.
Michael Jackson and Horace Broad-
nax. and center Ralph Dalton. Wingate
burned the Panthers for 26 points last
weekend. He teams with junior Reg-
gie Williams to account for most of the
Hoya point production. These five
players have been through four NCAA
Tournaments. and two NCAA Cham-
pionship games. That is why Thomp-
son is confident that the Panthers will
not catch his Hoyas sleeping.

“I don‘t think anything makes us
overconfident." Thompson said.
“These kids are at the point where they
realize that everybody has to work hard
in order for us to be a good team. These
kids have been to the Final Four. and
they know what pressure and competi-
tion is about.“ Thompson added. “I
think they know they have to be con-
sistent and ready to play. That will be

es all-time win record

By Greg Ficery
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh's men‘s
tennis program is looking up. Coming
off of an unexpected second-place
finish at the Big East Conference
Championships this past" fall. and with
the return of top player David Johnson
to the lineup on a full-time basis. the
team is again looking to break the
school record for victories in one
season (13). which they tied last spring.
The mark had previously stood un-
matched since 1926.

But how do they do it? After all. they
are a team without a single scholarship
or a traditional senior leader. In addi-
tion. they boast the highest QPA for a
varsity team on campus. The keys seem
to be the comradery and growing
maturity of juniors Johnson. Rich
Monteleone and Chuck DeVera. along
with the steady leadership of fifth-year
coach George Dieffenbach.

Having been teammates since their
freshman year has made it easier for
the trio of Pittsburghers to adjust com-
fortably to being part of a relatively
small group as far as varsity competi-
tion is concerned.

“We really have a great time.” said
Johnson. revealing the team‘s formula
for success. “We each have different
approaches to the game. but George
really helps keep us loose."

Johnson said he feels that part of his
role on the team is to provide some
perspective for the younger players:
"l‘l1 need to rub a little experience off
on the freshmen and help them deal

with the problems that we face in some
of the matches." In effect. by being a
role model for the younger players.
Johnson seems to be passing on the
same kind of genuine leadership that
Dieffenbach has shown him since he
was a freshman.

“George is an excellent coach." said
Johnson. seemingly unable to find
enough ways to express his or the
team’s admiration. “Most important-
ly. he helps everyone to keep
academics and athletics in perspective
and he relates very well with
everyone. "

Refreshingly. in a sport which is
noted for its individual nature and for
the inflated egos of its participants.
Johnson seems to be an exception to the
"rule.“ Johnson. a political science
major. has played the No. 1 spot since
his freshman year. but will start the
spring schedule at the No. 3 position
due. in part. to his spending the fall
semester in Washington. D.C. work-
ing on Capitol Hill. He is not fazed by
by the change.

"Tennis is such a team sport at this
level that you can‘t be too concerned
with personal goals." Johnson pointed
out. “1‘d really just like to see us break
the team record."

It is this sort of spirit which Dieffen-
bach believes is indicative of his teams
ability to achieve long-term goals.

“Nobody really cares what number
they play. as long as they're in the
lineup.“ said Dieffenbach. “This is
really nice for us because we can spend
time developing our games without
spending time playing challenge match-
es.

But how has the program become so
strong‘? According to Johnson. the team
had been fluctuating around the .500
mark for a few years since a strong
1979 season. attracting few of the
relatively large number of top—ﬂight
high school players that have been
coming out ofthe tri-state area. Then,
by pure coincidence. Johnson.

who is no longer with the team. all ar-
rived on campus in the fall of 1983.
Each had been ranked by the Allegheny
Mountain Tennis Association before
their arrival. The Panthers again fin-
ished the season with a .500 record.
while Johnson was compiling an im-
pressive 9-7 personal mark to capture
the MVP.

A 5-4 loss to Bucknell. whom the
team had only beaten once in thirty
years. is all that kept the 1985 Panthers
(13-8) from breaking the 59-year-old
record. Johnson dropped to a 7-9 total.
but transfer Jeff Dadowski picked up
the slack with a key 11-8 effort.
Monteleone and newcomer Greg
Campbell also contributed with 12-9
outputs as well as combining for a 12-3
doubles mark. .

This year has already been a success,
in a sense, with as many as 30 prospec-
tive players indicating an interest in at-
tending Pitt after hearing of the Pan-
thers‘ Big East performance. However,
this year’s squad. understandably,
wants the record for itself. It could be
a tough road. .

To start with, the Panthers ’86
schedule contains three fewer matches
than did their '85 schedule. “The

Chipman leads Pitt in tourney dream

Disgusted over Pitt's lackluster
basketball season, I decided to look into
my crystal ball on a chilly March after-
noon with hopes of seeing what lay in
the future for the squad. Here's what
I saw. to my surprise.

March 6 — Pitt head coach Roy
Chipman shocks everyone at the Big
East Tournament by announcing he and
Joey David will trade positions for the
Panthers‘ first—round game against
Georgetown. Chipman puts himself in
the starting lineup as point guard. while
designating David the head coach.
“Everyone said our whole problem this
season was at point guard and my
coaching." Chipman said. "It's got-
ten to the point where I decided it
would be better for the team if we
switch. Hell. Joey David is an
academic All-America. and I can play
some ball."

Pitt responds by shocking the Hoyas
67-66 as Charles Smith scores 32
points while Chipman dishes out 16
assists in his debut.

March 7 — With Chipman again
playing the point, Pitt upsets St. John‘s
77-75. A Chipman 18-foot set shot at
the buzzer made the difference in this
one. “I want the Pearl,” Chipman said
after the game. referring to Syracuse
point guard Dwayne Washington.

For The Pitt News

The sun shines off the water and a
warm breeze ruffles the hair. A ﬂash
of hot pink stripes can be seen at the
poolside. It wouldn't be surprising to
see Crockett and Tubbs stroll out to the
beat of “Miami Vice."

Suddenly laughter and shouts of
“nice suit“ fill the air. The setting
loses its “Miami Vice"-like at-
mosphere and instead takes on a
familiar blue and gold look. Members
of the University of Pittsburgh men’s
swimming team prepare for practice as
more laughter drifts across the pool.

Coach Fred Lewis strolls through the
stretching bodies. a grin spreading
across his face. His gaze takes in the
cause of all the amusement and he
begins to laugh too.

“The suit looks great RJ." Lewis
yells to one of the swimmers. “See. I

Chipman will match up against "The
Pearl“ in the tournament final.
March 8 — “Pearl" Washington
scores 27 points and Syracuse beats Pitt
in the Big East final 68-65. "Go home.
old man." Washington says to Chip-
man after the game. "You can dog the
rest. but you can't dog the best.“
March 10 — Pitt gets a NCAA Tour-
nament invitation despite its mediocre
17-13 record. All 10 Atlantic Coast
Conference teams are invited. and
everyone in the Big East except Con-

necticut and Seton Hall is given a berth. .

March 17 -—— Pitt. seeded 12th in the
East bracket. wins in the first round
over Maryland 42-40. Pitt forward
Matt Miklasevich is ejected after
sucker-punching Maryland All-
America forward Len Bias. "Bias
pushed Roy [Chipman] while battling

-for a rebound. and nobody does that to

my teammates. " Miklasevich says. ‘ ‘so
I punched him in the mouth." .
March 18 — Chipman shows up for
a practice with a Mohawk haircut. “I
think it’s about time I started getting
some attention," Chipman says.
March 20 —- Miklasevich is sus-
pended for the remainder of the tour-
nament. The suspension occurs just
hours after Villanova head coach Rollie
Massimino cries to NCAA officials that

told you it would be a hit."

Rick James — R] to his friends —
smiles at all the attention. The hot pink
bathing suit was typical of James’ sense
of humor and yet beli_ed the extent of
his talent. For the Panthers. the junior
from Media. Pa. has become more than
just a comedian. James is the can-do
man.

“RJ is the can-do swimmer on our
team." Lewis said. “If you ask him to
do something he always says ‘I can do
it. Coach.’ That’s very important to the
team even though it isn’t always best
for RJ as an individual swimmer."

James isn‘t always happy about that
role. However. he recognizes that the
needs of the team sometimes come
before those of the individual member.
For that reason he swims in whatever
position he is needed, and maintains his
sense of humor along the way.

“I always wanted to be a diver."
James said. "Seriously. my role is one

Miklasevich may go after one of his
players in the Pitt-Villanova second-
round contest. "That's okay. I have to
get in shape for the Pitt football season
anyway." Miklasevich says.

March 21 — Miklasevich joins the
International Boxing Federation and is

Randy Miller

immediately ranked third in the
heavyweight division. "I‘ve always
dreamed of boxing." Miklasevich
says. "I always dreamed of being a
boxer. but my dad  he made me play
basketball."

March 22 — Pitt continues its surge
by beating Villanova 77-76. Villanova
freshman Doug West. after arriving at
the game in a pink Rolls Royce. gets
hassled all through the game by vulgar
Pitt students. He has a chance to win
the game for the Wildcats when he goes
to the foul line for two shots after be-
ing fouled by Keith Armstrong with
just one second remaining. However.
West refuses to go to the line, declar-
ing he's decided he will transfer. “I‘m
just sick of it." West‘ says. “I‘m

where I can just worry about basket-
ball." Anyway. Massimino inserts his
son R.C.. a four—year scrub. to shoot
the foul shots. R.C. shoots two airballs
and Pitt wins.

March 23 — West announces he‘s
transferring to Penn State. He spends
the night celebrating in his new man-
sion with football coach Joe Paterno.
“This mansion is something Pitt or
Villanova could never have given me."
West says.

upsets top-ranked Duke 56-49. Pitt
guard Curtis Aiken. benched in the first
half after complaining to Coach David
that Chipman "never passes me the
ball." returns in the second half to
score 16 points. all on long-range
jumpers.

March 25 — Miklasevich announces
he‘ll box the winner of the Larry
Holmes-Michael Spinks match for the
heavyweight championship.

March 26 — Chipman and Georgia
Tech point guard Mark Price duel each
other in the finals of the Eastern
Regionals. Price wins the battle. scor-
ing a game-high 36 points. but Chip-
man (29 points) leads Pitt to an 89-82
victory over the Yellow Jackets and in-

to the Final Four.

March 28 ~ Pitt flies to Dallas. the
site of the National Championship.
Coach David says the key to beating
North Carolina in the semifinals is
stopping center Brad Daugherty.
Syracuse and Kansas are the other Final
Four participants.

March 29 — Pitt upsets North
Carolina 45-42 as Chipman dishes out
a career-high 19 assists. "He can do
it all." North Carolina head coach
Dean Smith says after the game. "He's
the next Magic Johnson.“

March 30 — Chipman shocks the na-
tion by quitting the team as Pitt
prepares to play Syracuse for the Na-
tional Championship. "It's been fun.
but I'm done." Chipman says at a
huge. nationally televised press con-
ference. "I just don‘t want to play
against Pearl Washington again. He
burned me last time. Idid it all for this
team — coached. played and even got
a Mohawk. But it’s time to move on.
It‘s time I do what I want to with my
life. I want to make cardboard boxes."

March 31 ~ With player-coach Joey
David at the helm. Pitt‘s miraculous
season comes to an end. “The Pearl"
pumps in 38 points and hands out 18
assists to lead Syracuse to a 92-58
victory.

O

for swim team

East and Eastern Intercollegiate
Outstanding Swimmer of the Year —
he captured the 1984 Eastern Inter-
collegiate Most Valuable Swimmer his
freshman year. Last year James won
the 100- and 2()0-yard backstroke and
200 individual medley at the Big East
Championships. He won both events
again this year.

"RJ has unlimited physical ability.“
Lewis said. “Because of his body
shape. he can do distance or sprints.“

One swimmer who is trying to help
James reach his potential is roommate
and Panther co—captain Donald Martin.
Although they had a rocky start. James
and Martin have since become close
friends. James also feels that they have
become better swimmers.

“Donald and I used to swim against
one another in high school and we
couldn‘t stand each other." James ex-
plained. “The first year at Pitt was
rough because we were opposites in

everything from swimming to girl-
friends. Everything he did well I did
poorly and vice versa. Somehow we
became friends though and. funny as
it seems now. roommates.

“I can honesty say that I would be
having a worse season than I am if it
weren‘t for Donald. We push each
other to get up in the morning and go

to practice or to class. Although we 3,;

came from really different back-
grounds. I think that we have each
become more balanced. I think room-
ing with Donald has made me a more
tolerable human being and improved
my disposition." said James.

If the hot pink bathing suit is any in-
dication. James‘ disposition seems to
be in good shape. He hopes to enjoy
the remainder of the season as well as
improve his performances. His can-do
attitude helped the Panthers net another
Big East title. Not bad for a guy who
is just ‘winging it.‘

The 10 greatest Pirate memories

Well. if you haven’t noticed. spring
is almost here. The weather outside
may say that it‘s the middle of winter.
but my calendar says the opening day
of baseball season is a little more than
a month away.

So, all of you Pitt basketball fans can
quit mourning over the team‘s lousy
season. and all you Penguin fans can
stop dreaming, and you can get ready
for another fun-filled. exciting year at
Three Rivers Stadium with the Bucs.

Yeah, right. And the Cleveland
Cavaliers are going to win the NBA
Championship. The Pirates have little
chance to excite any fans. Oh, sure,
their ads say they have a good, young
nucleus of aggressive players, but I’m
afraid I don't see any Willie Stargells
or Dave Parkers in the bunch. A team
can have all the aggressive players they
want, but if they don’t have someone
to hit the ball out of the park or steal
bases, they aren‘t going to win many
games. And, let’s face it, Pittsburgh
fans just don’t support losers.

Whatever happened to the good ol’
days? You remember, the days when
a team like the Montreal Expos or the
Chicago Cubs would come into town
and the Pirates would crush them?
When players like Al Oliver and Richie
Zisk would punish opposing pitchers?
When the Pirates would win more
games than they lose‘?

I remember those days well. I was

probably the biggest Bucs fan in the tri-
state area. I had my Pirate cap and my
Pirate helmet (that I got on Pirate
Helmet Day) and my authentic, imita-
tion Roberto Clemente baseball bat; I
would sit and listen to Bob Prince and

John Zaphyr

then later, Milo Hamilton, call the
games. I would always go crazy when
the Bucs would win and would always
be depressed when they would lose.
Those were the days, all right. And
since I am in such a retrospective
mood, here are my top 10 memories
of those great summer afternoons and
nights watching the Bucs: .

10. Ed Ott ripping apart Rowland
Off1ce’s helmet at Atlanta in 1979. The
Pirates beat the Braves that day after
two brawls and a beanball incident in-
volving that flamethrower Phil Niekro.

9. Dave Roberts pitching in the bot-
tom of the 12th inning at San Diego
with the bases loaded and a three balls-
no strike count to the opposing pitcher.
Roberts went on to retire the side
despite Dave Winfield, the Padres
rightfielder, who was standing at sec-

Rife concentrates

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News A

No brain, no pain.

It’s hardly a statement you would
hear coming from an institution of
higher education like the University of
Pittsburgh.

But, just ask some of the members
of the Panthers’ swim team what it
means to them. They’ll certainly tell
you.

Geoff Rife, a sophomore from West
Chester, Pa., knows the importance of
literally shutting off your brain in order
to compete as a distance swimmer. It
takes complete and total concentration
to forget about the pain involved with
the continuous hours of straight swim-
ming that these athletes go through.
“You have to shut off your brain,”

Rife said. “You have to forget about
everything -— life, school — just
everything for about two hours of the
day. Some days it’s easy to come to
practice and do it and some days, when
you’re tired after classes, it’s hard to
do it. But the key is to forget the pain.
No brain, no pain. You just don’t think
about it.”

Rife’s bestevent is the 1,650-yard
freestyle, which just happens to be the
longest and one of the most tedious
events in swimming. It takes a special
type of person to be able to sacrifice
the pain for the competition. Rife is
working on being that type of person.
“Geoff needs to forget about the pain
completely,” said head coach Fred
Lewis. “The more pain you can en-
dure, the better swimmer you are. You
cannot dwell on how much it hurts.
You can‘t give in.”

ond base and giving Roberts the choke
sign. The Pirates eventually won that
game.

8. Mike Easler‘s entire season in
1980. The “Hitman" hit everything in
sight that year. and it was great to see
the former journeyman minor—leaguer
do so well.

7. Jose DeLeon’s first near no-hitter
in 1983. The Pirates were in New York
and this was the second game of a
doubleheader. DeLeon went into the
ninth inning with a no-hitter until Mets
third baseman Hubie Brooks broke it
up with a single to left field. The
Pirates lost that game in extra innings
and marked the beginning of the end
of their pennant hopes for that year.

6. Phil Garner and Larry Bowa
wrestling at Veterans Stadium in
Philadelphia during one of those great
Pirates-Phillies confrontations. I could
mention other games when the Pirates
beat the Phils, like in 1979 when the
Bucs were losing 8-0 and then came
back to win 13-1 1, but this moment,
more than any other, sticks out in my
mind. I hated Larry Bowa and it was
wonderful to see him on the ground.

5. Dave Parker’s batting titles in
1977 and 1978 and his MVP season in
1978. Parker played part of the ’78
season with a broken cheekbone, and
he wore both a hockey mask and a foot-
ball helmet to protect himself. I don’t
care what people say or how out of

Rife began swimming when he was

.14-years-old. His high school, West

Chester East, did not have a swim team
so he competed for an AAU club. He
would swim in the summer for fun, but
when his friends encouraged him to
compete, he decided to do it.

Choosing a college was not

‘something hard for Rife to do. After

looking at Maryland, Florida State and
Penn State, Rife knew that Pitt was the
place for him. “I heard a lot about the
swim program,” Rife said. “When I
came here for my recruit weekend I
really liked it. I knew Fred was a" good
coach. Also, the people here are real-
ly friendly. It is a good atmosphere.”

If you were to walk around the Pitt
campus and see one of the Panthers’.
swimmers, it is likely you would find
some teammates nearby. They are a

shape he might have gotten — during
those two years he was the best baseball
player I had ever seen.

4. John Candelaria’s no-hitter in
1976 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
It was Candyman Night that evening:
every fan received a candy bar. It was
fitting that the man pitched his gem on
that night.

3. The Pirates sweeping the Cincin-
nati Reds in three games to win the
Championship Series in 1979. I’ll
never forget the third game, when
Willie Stargell hit a home run and all
the Pirates‘ wives stood on the dugout
and danced to Sister Sledge and “We
Are Family.” Unbelievable.

2. Willie Stargell Day in 1980. The
Pirates played the Dodgers that day,
but who cares who won? The big thing
was when The Captain was carried

‘ around the stadium in a convertible and

the fans were allowed to show their ap-
preciation for the man.

1. The 1979 World Championship
Season. What can I possibly say? It was
a dream come true for this Pirate fan.
When Willie Stargell hit that home run
off Scott McGregor to give the Bucs
a 2-1 lead in the seventh game of the
World Series, it gave me chills. I might
sound sentimental, but I don’t care.

Summer and fall of 1979 was one of
the most enjoyable times in my life.
Here’s to a return of those times. Let’s
just hope it doesn’t take too long.

close team and that made the adjust-
ment to college a much easier one for
Rife. “I was really worried about col-
lege at first,” Rife admitted. “On the
first day I met almost all the swimmers,
and I did not have any trouble since
then.”

Hisiteammates also make it easier on
Rife to put up with his demanding
schedule. Morning workouts require
him to be ready to go at 6:30 a.m. After
about an hour of working out and then
lifting weights, it is down the hill to

breakfast. Having classes from 11 a.m. »

to 3 p.m. allows Rife to sleep for a bit
after his workout. In the afternoon it
is back up to the pool from 3:30 to 5:30
and then to dinner. Aside from a little
relaxation and some time with his
friends, Rife spends most of the even-
ings studying.

Dieffenbach. “We needed to sacrifice
quantity for quality, but if we can win
five of our first six matches, we can
break the record.”

Thus, Dieffenbach said he feels that
the balance of the season could be
decided by the time the Panthers return
from their second of two three-match
spring trips. The squad will leave for
Washington, D.C. on Friday to play a
four-team match at George Washington
University beginning at 2 p.m. and then
will travel to Philadelphia next
weekend to play, among others,
Bucknell. ”

Okay, but where is the program
headed? According to Dieffenbach, a
Big East title could only be a year
away, but the level on which the pro-

gram settles is, more or less, up to the .

university.

“We could win the Big East next- _

year if we get a couple more of these
recruits,” said Dieffenbach, holding.a
thick file of newly received letters, a
file in size directly proportional to the
amount of points which the team ac-
cumulated in the Big East Champion-
ships. “We’ve just been hanging in
with hard work and our reputation,”
added Dieffenbach. “We can’t expect
to be competitive with Penn State or
West Virginia, though, until we get an
indoor facility.”

This hypothetical facility has ap- ’

parently been on the drawing board for
a few years now. Its drawbacks are,

obviously, cost and location. Until .

these issues can somehow be settled,
says Dieffenbach, the Panthers will just
have to keep relying oh hard work.

Whether the ’86 Panthers are able to '

reach their goal or not, it is obvious
that, with the help of stable leadership
and the Class of ’87, the program is
headed in the right direction.

Although the morning workouts are
not one of Rife’s favorite things, after-
noon practice is another story. While
the competition you would find there
is not the same as it is in meets, there
is still some intense swimming. “We
race each other all day in workouts,”
Rife said. “Sometimes we go over-
board. It makes you swim harder,
though.” ’

So does the heat of a meet. You can
be sure Rife will be swimming his
hardest when he hits the water in the

The Pitt News, March 5, I986

Spector

l By Mike Ryan

For The Pitt News

Alisa Spector. a member of Pitt’s
women‘s gymnastics team. is a rare
athlete. Spector. a junior from Ken-
more High School in Kenmore. N.Y..
has had a tough season. However. this
has not stopped her from keeping her
spirits high in the gym.

Spector had enjoyed her first seasons
at Pitt by qualifying for Nationals as
a freshman and regionals as a
sophomore. The junior has been
hampered by a shoulder injury
throughout most of this season. The in-
jury is located on her left bicep tendon.
Her doctors diagnosed it as a slight tear
in her rotator cuff. which caused a
pinched nerve in her neck. Most
athletes would have given up on this
season, but not Alisa Spector.

“My family started to give me a
positive outlook on life ever since I was
a little girl,” said Spector. “They are-
always there for me when I need

“ 4 them.”

    

Donna Sanft. the women’s gym-
nastics head coach at Pitt. gives Spec-
tor high marks for her determination.

“Alisa is a driven person in and out
of the gym." said Sanft. “When things
are not going well for Alisa. she knows
that sooner or later everything will get

better. She is a perfectionist. If Alisa
gets one ‘B’ in any one of her classes,
she is not completely satisfied.”

I This explains why Spector has kept
her head up throughout her injury set-

is a perfectionist

back. At the Pitt—Penn State meet.
Spector did not finish in the top three
of the all—around. yet she did not get
down on herself.

“I am not worried about finishing in
the all—around [in a meet held Feb. 8]."
said Spector. "All I needed was for my
shoulder to heal and that enabled me
to practice more."

Eight days was all the time she need-
ed. Spector finished first in the all-
around in a triangular meet on Feb. 16
against West Virginia and Maryland
with a total score of 3645.

She continued her comeback on Feb.
22 against Slippery Rock at Trees Hall.
Spector finished first in the all—around
with a total score of 36.6 which includ-
ed an impressive 9.35 on the vault and
a 9.4 on the floor exercise.

Sanft is not surprised with Spector’s
turnaround. “Alisa has the mental at-
titude that she will not let any negative
thoughts get in her way,” said Sanft.
“This is the reason why she is going
to have a complete comeback.”

The way Spector has performed in
her last two meets, it looks like her
comeback is in motion.

The Pitt hockey club will look to go along way in the upcoming playoffs. In order
to _do so, Pitt will need to put the puck in the net, just as Jim Owens Jr. is doing

7:; in a recent game. Pitt will face either Carnegie Mellon or Duquesne in the open-

ing round on Thursday. A victory would give Pitt the right to face Gannon on
Saturday for the championship.

Gannon defeats
hockey club, 9-2

By Mary Wolf

. Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club ended
its regular season Friday with a 7-2 loss
to Gannon at Erie. The Panthers
finished the year with a I3-2-I record
which earned them first place in their
division as they prepare for this week‘s
playoffs.

Pitt coach Roger Oldaker Sr. felt that
the officials in Friday’s game with
Gannon were a little less than neutral
as they made some unjustified calls on

‘the Panthers in order to provide the

home team with the upper hand
throughout the game.

“They did a number on us, up
there." said Oldaker. “The otficials
kept us two men shorthanded for most
of the game. There’s no way we could

play the whole time with three men and
win.”

If the Panthers survive their first
playoff game which will be Thursday
evening against either Duquesne or
CMU. they will have a final oppor-
tunity to even the score with Gannon.
A victory Thursday will set the Pan-
thers up for a final bout on Saturday
afternoon with Gannon. which will
decide the new league champions.

Oldaker believes that Friday's loss
to Gannon may have given the Panthers
a reason to succeed in their drive to the
championship. “I think Gannon did us
a favor. Maybe the incentive to beat
them will carry over to the playoffs.
It all depends on how badly our guys
want it.“ said Oldaker.

Saturday's game will be played on
Pitt‘s home ice at Lakevue Ice Palace
in Valencia at 3:30 pm.

Panther

By Shelley Ramus
For The Pitt News

_ It was both an exciting and disap-
pointing weekend for the Pitt men‘s
gymnastics team. The Panthers trav-
eled to the Great Lakes Championships
expecting to be a challenger for the
team title. When the results were in.
however, Western Michigan was on
top with a score of 262.25. Pitt scored
a 257.65 to ﬁnish a disappointing third.
while Kent State claimed second place
with a 260.6.

The exciting part of the Champion-
ships came during the individual com-
petition. The Panthers turned in strong
performances on every event and
claimed the top five spots on the
parallel bars. Pitt had four gymnasts
named to the All—Great Lakes League
team —— Matt Peters, Ben Rovee, Jorge
Sanchez and Mark Klafter — more than
any ‘of the other five teams at the
competition. .

“I feel like the coach that took his
team to the one-yard line but couldn’t
get them into the end zone,” said coach

The Pitt News," March '5, 1986

  ymnasts maintain winning ways

Frank D’Amico. “Individually we
were dominating. but on the team coni-
petition our lack of depth really hurt
us. The injury to Jim Gemelas has
probably cost us four or five points and
been a big factor in our final team
score.”

The parallel bars and the horizontal
bar were two high points for the Pan-
thers. On the parallel bars it was all
Pitt. Klafter scored a 9.5 to capture first
place. followed by Rovee in second.
Peters and Sanchez in third and Steve
Powanda in fourth. It appeared as if
Klafter would also finish first on the
horizontal bars after posting another
9.5. It was not to be, however, as
Peters posted a season—high 9.6 to win
the event.

“There were two highlights in the
meet for me," said D’Amico. “The
first one was our performance on the
parallel bars. We have improved a
great deal on that event over the year

and are now a strong parallel bars‘

team.

“The other highlight of the competi-
tion was presenting the horizontal bar
awards,” continued D’Amico. “Mark

looked as if he had first place won.
Then Matt did his routine and scored
the 9.6. His performance was just
great. and I think it really broke the ice
for him."

Peters finished the meet with a vic-
tory on the horizontal bar and a third
place finish on the parallel bars. Klafter
won the rings and parallel bars. fin-
ished second on the horizontal bar and
took third place on the pommel horse
and floor.

Other top finishers for Pitt included
Rovee and Sanchez. Rovee placed se-
cond on both the rings and the parallel
bars. Sanchez tied for third on the vault
and the parallel bars.

"I thought that Ben did extremely
well at the meet.” commented
D’Amico. “He barely made ﬁnals, but
once he was there he had some great
performances. He has really improved
this year and is doing really well.

“Right now it appears as though
Mark will go to Nationals again. If
Matt, Ben. and Jorge continue to turn
in such strong performances, we might
be able to send four Pitt gymnasts to
Nationals."

Martin
leads by
example

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

“Leaders are made, they are not
born; and they are made just like
anything else has ever been made in
this C()Lll17l"_\‘ —~ by hard eﬁort. And
that ’s the price that we all have to pay
to achieve that goal, or any goal. ”

— Vince Lotnbczrdim

There are two kinds of leaders in this
world. First, there are those who are
verbal leaders. They are the type who
can constantly tell people how to do
things. Then there are those who lead
by example, who make an impression
on people because of what they do, not
what they say. They work hard and
give their all in every situation. They
are the people that others look up to.

Donald Martin, a member of the
University of Pittsburgh swim team.
falls into the second category. At dai-

;ly practice, Martin, who is from

Marlton, N.J.. shows through hard
work and dedication why he is one of
the best swimmers on the Panther team.

“He has been a big influence on
me." said Geoff Rife. one of Martin's
teammates. “He is a positive influence.
He has a good attitude toward practice
and workouts. He sets a good exam-it
ple for everyone else to follow.“

While swimming is important to
Martin, the main reason he came to Pitt
was the reputation of the engineering
school. His schedule is not an easy one
because the engineering program is
demanding. yet he has been able to
keep up with both school and swim-
ming. “Trying to stay on schedule with
engineering school was just too
much,” Martin said. “I had to strike
a balance between how many classes
I could take and still swim respectably.
I imagine, ifl would have stayed with
a-full load of engineering and swim-
ming, they both would have suffered -.~..
a lot.“

Martin began swimming when he
was 10 after a club coach urged both
Martin and his sister Amanda to join.
It was his sister, a four-time All-
America at Southern Illinois. who
helped him along the way. “She was
always somebody for me to look up
to.” Martin said.

Another person who inﬂuenced him
was Sandy Pigeon, a former Pitt swim-
mer. Pigeon swam the same events that
Martin does and was an assistant coach
his freshman year. “He came to col- ‘:3
lege with nothing and worked his way
up to become very good." Martin said.

It seems only natural that Martin
would look up to somebody who is a
hard worker.
