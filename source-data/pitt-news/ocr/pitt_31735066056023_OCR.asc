Suspect in
Cecil shooting

pleads

16?Iear-old Bruce Cabbagestalk
to ace sentencing on August 22

Cesca Antonelli
News Editor

When the two police offi-
cers brought in the defendant,
16-year-old Bruce
Cabbagestalk, his hands were
cuffed tightly behind his back.
His family, a line of six
women and children, trailed

behind him. He looked too ‘

young to be in court.

Barbara Cecil wiped at her
eyes as the boy accused of
shooting her son, Kevin, last
July stood with his back to her
just over 10 feet away.

Last Thursday,
Cabbagestalk, who grew up in
East Allegheny, plead guilty to
attempted murder, aggravated
assault, robbery, conspiracy,
and carrying an unlicensed
firearm.

There is no plea agreement
in the case; Cabbagestalk said
he was pleading guilty only
“because I shot Mr. Cecil.”
Cabbagestalk now faces 37.5-
75 years in prison. Sentencing
will take place on August 22.

“The defendant indicated
that [he and his friends] had
the intent to use the money for

a 40-ounce bottle of beer,” said‘

Assistant District Attorney
Christopher Connors when he
recounted thernight of the
shooting.

Connors said that on the
night of July 13, Cecil and a

Pitt receives smaller budget increase than requested

Benjamin Jackson
Editor-in-Chief

Pitt will get a small surprise from the
state legislature.

The state appropriations for Pitt went
through last week. The House approved
Pitt’s budget at exactly the same levels as
last year, while the Senate gave Pitt $1.3

million more in the category of education

and general expenses. This raised the

amount Pitt will receive from
$130,935,000 to $132,235,000.

This increase was approved by the
House and is now sitting on the govemor’s
desk. Governor Ridge has 10 days to sign
the bill. The spokesman for the govemor’s
office said that Ridge plans to sign it into
law as part of the budget agreement.

“We asked for a six percent increase,
and this amounts to a one percent
increase,” said Art Rarnicone of the office
of budget planning and analysis. “Even

though it’s nice to get more money, it was
not as much as you think.”

This additional funding may mean
changes in the proposed budget for the
coming year. How the money will ulti-
mately be spent is up to the Chancellor
and the executive committee of the Board
of Trustees. It is too late for the full board
to make any decisions, so the decision will
be left up to the executive committee.

Seminar addresses racial concerns in law

Charisse E. Merchant
For The Pitt News

Namosha Smith, dean of the
School of Law, joined with some
members from the NAACP, city
council, and other nonprofit
organizations to hold an infor-

— mative seminar to address prob-

lems facing “African Americans
and the Criminal Justice
System” on Saturday in the stu-
dent union.

The seminar, which consist-
ed of two panels, discussed and
raised issues concerning “Race
and Politics of the Criminal
Justice System” and “Youth and
Crime Policies, A Community
Perspective”. »

Both panels were ﬁlled with
group discussions on law based
on the black experience. The
possibility of a new Pittsburgh
city curfew law came up.

“A curfew will not solve the
problem. The black community
has stepped up to bat,” said‘
Mark Brentley, a community
activist.

Brentley argued that there

now enforced helps to oppress
the Black people,” Udin said.
“The curfew is a diversion; it
distracts us from the real
issues...the black people don’t
make guns or create drugs.”

Udin said that today, law
makers are trying to fix the prob-
lems in the wrong ways. Rather
than attacking “the bottom of the
pyramid,” he suggested laws
address the top, where those who
control it are.

Other speakers such as
Regina Reagan of the NAACP,-
who is also the Chairperson of
Prison Committee, said that pris-
ons, jails and detentioncenters
are overwhelmingly populated
with African Americans. Paul
Gettleman, an attorney, also
spoke of the blatant racism, and
injustices of severe sentencing of
black youth.

One thing that was agreed
upon was that racism is on the
rise, worse than it was during the
‘60s.

“Maybe some people are
afraid to say it, but I will say it.
It’s time for a revolution,”
Raheem said.

has been a decrease in crime, but
persisted, “[The black communi-
ty] did it, not talk of a curfew.”

Mary Young of Children &
Youth Services shares those
views. “Implementing the cur-
few seems to be an answer, but
that and more police will not be
the right answer...We need to
look a what brought us to this
extreme,” she said.

Many people at the seminar
expressed a sense of the “crimi-
nalizationf’ of black youths by
society.

“Look at how black youth
are depicted in television,
movies and in the media; and
how Pittsburgh police respond to
the black community,” said
Khalis Raheem of the Gang
Peace Council.

“Young black males are
pulled over by the police for no
reason, except for being young
black males,” Raheem said,
before suggesting that racism is
on the rise with the continuous
burning of black churches.

Councilman Sala Udin was
also one of the panelists. “The
way the laws were written and

The Pitt News, Wednesday, July 3, 1996

The Pitt News, Wednesday, July 3, 1996

Soffa leaves amid
restructuring concerns

Charisse E. Merchant
For The Pitt News

June 30 was the end of
MaryLou Soffa’s position as
dean of Graduate Studies in
Arts and Science and the begin-
ning of new and deliberate
changes in that school as well.

As of July 1, Soffa will
return to teaching full time on
the undergraduate level in the
computer science department.
Soffa, who said she missed
teaching, resigned in order to
continue her research in com-
puter science.

Soffa, a dean for ﬁve years,
is eager to return to the under-
graduate leve1,.despite the hard
work and effective changes she
has made. As dean, Soffa has
been successful in her goals to
better the School of Graduate
Studies. According to Soffa,
from 1991-1995 there was an
84 percent increase in minority
student enrollment in the gradu-
ate school and a 70 percent
increase in African American
students in the same time peri—
od.

Also, under the care of
Soffa, a computerized data base
was developed. This helped as
an information net to the stu-
dents. Funds and fellowships
were provided in order to
increase the retention rate
among minority students.
Advisors, faculty members, and
mentors were made accessible

to students.

Soffa helped to better the
position of teacher’s assistants.
She made training available for
them, as well as increasing the
number of TAs.

“Teacher’s assistants used
to complain of heavy work
loads,” said Soffa.

Grad Line, a graduate
school paper, and Grad Guide, a
hand book for new students,
were also established.

“I think the program was
very successful. My only hope
is that they will continue,” Soffa
said. “However, I’m very con-
cerned with the plan of recon-
struction of the Graduate School
of Arts and Science that was
recently announced by Provost
Maher.” '

According to the plan, the
positions of dean of College of
Arts and Sciences, now held by
Mary Briscoe, and dean of
Graduate Studies, Soffa’s old
position, will be degraded to
associate deans. .

“I think this is a real mis-
take,” Soffa said. “Many
changes that I’ve made, as well
as Briscoe, were possible
because of our status as dean;
associate deans won’t have that
same clout to make further
changes.”

Soffa strongly feels that stu-
dents should not have that dis-
service. “They [students] should
have ready access to person on
the dean level, and they don’t,”
she said.

Sit right back, and you’ll hear a tale of a fateful trip, but this is much more
than ﬁve passengers on a three-hour tour.

Instead, it is a 57 day tour that began in Ensenada, Mexico, and after sever-
al stops, will return to Seattle, Washington. The trip in question is the ﬁrst

Semester at Sea summer voyage.

“It has been a small, community and adventure oriented group of students,”
said Gary Griggs, a professor from the University of California at Santa Cruz.
‘-‘The students have been very well-behaved. It is always a challenge to turn 200

students loose in one port.”

. The only thing close to disaster this summer has been that one faculty
member and his wife were nearly left behind in‘ Sydney Australia when they
didn’t make it back to the ship on time, according to Griggs.

There are 243 students on board the ship from 103 schools. Twenty-six are
ﬁorn Pitt, which is the largest contingent ﬁorn any school. The second largest
group is from the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Due to scheduling conﬂicts, there will not be a summer voyage next sum-

. mer. There are plans in the works for future summer voyages, however.
So, for right now, you may live vicariously through one of your own. Pitt_

Zealand, and Australia. The ship is currently in Samoa.

We were told before leaving on
this year’s semester at sea summer
voyage that this is to be the last one
for a while. That being the case, I sug-
gest that you leam to enjoy living vic-
ariously through me for a while.

The journey began in San Diego,
where all the students met for orienta-
tion. Due to ﬂight scheduling, I
arrived a day before everyone else.

On the moming of the scheduled
arrival, I met a fellow Pitt student,
Althea Rodgers. We acted as a sort of
welcoming committee. Here’s how it
worked: we sat by the pod, and as
people walked by, we said hello. This
went on for almost three hours, during
which time we met close to 100 of the
voyagers, and the committee grew to
a size of about 15.

The first night together as a
group was much too important to sit
around a hotel, so I organized a trip to
the Padres vs. the Phillies game. It
took eight cabs to transport the 34
people that decided to join in. The fes-
tive atmosphere at the game was a
deﬁnite sign of what lay ahead

After an early morning bus ride
to Ensenada, Mexico, we all ' boarded

- the new Universe Explorer. There are

a total of 300 people on a ship that can
hold 700. This, combined with the
fact that we haven’t seen land in over
a week, creates a very interesting
social atmosphere. Everybody must
be civil, if not friends; there is no
avoiding anyone. With this amiable
spirit, I ﬁnd myself frequently sitting
out on deck or eating lunch with peo-
ple I may never have been able to
associate with on land simply due to
differences in personality.

As far as speciﬁc occurrences
and activities, they’ve been under-
standably limited thus far. In the
evenings, when the student union
transforms into a night club, I am an
occasional DJ. . There is a whole lot
of tanning and card playing.

And of course there are the class-
es. This is the most surreal aspect of
the voyage. Here I am taking an
oceanography course and I look out
the window and see — THE
OCEAN. Three of us in that class
were the ﬁrst to see dolphins. Quite
different from looking out the

Cathedral and seeing a dog on
Flagstaff.

The most interesting day was
when we crossed the equator. Anyone
who hadn’t before crossed (called
Pollywogs) had to go through a ritual
to become Shellback so that King
Neptune (who was actually the cap-
tain all decked out in something from
“The Little Mermaid”) would let us
pass into the Southern Hemisphere.
This ritual included having curry
dumped on your head, kissing a dead
ﬁsh (I still think I got a little tongue),
kissing Neptune’s ring, and being
knighted by Dr. Scaglion, our acade-
mic dean. Needless to say, it was quite
the experience. I’m glad to have gone
through it -——- ONCE.

_ - Paradise Found

I’m pleased to report that I have
ofﬁcially discovered paradise. It is
located on a little island off of Tahiti
called Moorea. It consists of a few
mountain peaks all covered with lush
tropical foliage with pristine white
beaches surrounding the whole island
andwaterthatyoucanwadeinforat
least 100 yards.

This is where most of the
Semester at Sea student body spent at
least one night, scattered in bungalows
on the beach. This is in stark contrast
to the capital city of Papeete, which
reminded me of a cleaner version of
Tijuana with a beautiful view.

I spent the beginning of our stop

called “touristy” has not yet infected
Moorea so one really got the feel of
ﬂre natural environment of the tropical
island. This is with the exception of a
Club Med and a few similar resorts.

I spent the ﬁrst day attached to
the beach. While lying there, absorb-
ing as much UV rays as possible, I
had the opportunity to speak with
some natives. Considering the native
language is Tahitian (No worries =
‘Aita pua—pua) and the ofﬁcial lan-
guage is French (No wonies = some-
thing unpronounceable by someone
not French), they spoke amazingly
good English. For them, as tourism
grows, it becomes a necessity.

That evening, I rode on horse-
back into the mountains to watch the
sunset. It was so beautifully red, I
almost forgot how sore my butt was.
Our guide gave my fellow equestrians
and I the biggest honking grapefruit I
have ever seen. After stopping at a
market to get a ﬁeshly picked pineap-
ple, I sat down for dinner. These were
the two juiciest pieces of fruit I had
ever sunk my teeth into.

The two things that must be
known about Papeete is that: 1) it is
very expensive and 2) the only things
to do in the immediate area involve
the spending of money. A beer was
typically $10, and a maitai was
between $18-$20.

I was very pleased to partake in a
tour of the mountains of Tahititi. We
headed up 4,000 feet along a rocky
path through thick trees and brush.

From the top of the small island
mountain, I felt like I could see the
whole world.

As far as I was concerned, I real-

ly could. The most beautiful part of
the mountains was actually the clouds.
They didn’t cover the very tops, just a
part of the sides. They were like enor-
mous monsters gently peeking over
the side of a crib, into the valley, being
sure not to disturb the sleeping child.
0 As an encore, we were taken to a
majestic waterfall. We were all given
the opportunity to wade into a small
pool and stand underneath the falling
water. Water dropping 75 feet can
give one heck of a massage.

After having my fill of the
water’s magical ﬁngers, I sat; back on
a rock and watched. I watched the
water take its plunge. I watched the
plants which grew right out of the
rock. I watched the rock glistening in
the sun almost as if they were sweat-
ing. That was my ﬁrst spiritual experi-
ence during my voyage. I knew then
that all was well.

Francisco, and the great food of
Boston and rolls it into a city that was
almost impossible to leave. The only
way to top a great city is with a beauti-
ful country, which is exactly what
New Zealand has accomplished.

My ﬁrst ﬁill day in New Zealand
was spent in Rotorua, which is their
answer to Yellowstone. I spent the
day amongst bubbling mud baths,
blowing geysers, and the pungent
stink of sulphur.

The next day — on to the

Waitomo Caves, which is a smaller ’

version of our very own Carlsbad
Caverns in New Mexico. The only
difference is that they have added a
plethora of glow worms. When inside
a pitch black cave, you look above
you to see a constellation of blue-
green on the ceiling.

While these were both absolutely
stunning places to visit, what most
intrigued me were observations that I
made on the two different three hour
bus rides. The ﬁrst was that all the pic-
tures of Ireland I have seen were actu-
ally taken in New Zealand. There
were the greenest rolling hills irnagin—
able —-- everywhere. Next were the
innumerable sheep farms. There were
little white puifs roaming the hill side
—everywhere. ‘

Everything the New Zealanders
did, they expertly did in excess. This
includes the fact that the entire time
that we were there it was either rain-
ing or threatening to rain.

My last full day was spent
exploring the ins and outs of
Auckland. I spent much of the time
trucking through the many beautiful,
parks. There I was pleased to ﬁnd
another excess: if there was more than
a square block of grass, there was a
rugby field. Kiwi’s, as the New
Zealander’s call themselves, go nuts
for Rugby the way Americans go nuts
for oxygen. Given a choice, New
Zealanders would take nigby, if they
thought they’d be able to get in a
quick game before suffocating.

This is just what I did in the span
of a few days. I didn’t get a chance to
bungee jump, jet boat, or visit the
South Island with its skiing and ijords.
For anyone who has ever though of
visiting New Zealand, either plan a
few months for a thorough backpack-
ing trip, or don’t plan on seeing even a
small fraction of what there is to see.
For anyone who hasn’t thoughtabout
visiting New Zealand, start rearrang-
ing your plans to stop there.

Budget

0 from page 1

Analysis will meet with
Chancellor Nordenberg and
Provost Maher to hammer out
a new budget plan which
includes this additional $1.3
million. There is no word yet
on whether this means that the
4.5 percent tuition increase
will be revised. Other pro-
grams which may also be
affected are the 3.5 percent pay
raise for the staff and faculty
salary pool and the proposed
lay-offs. I

“We’d like to do as much
through attrition as we can,”
Rarnicone said. Attrition is the
process of reducing the work-
force by not hiring replacement
workers for those who quit.
Other ways that the university
is considering for reducing the
workforce are through early
retirement and through layoffs.

Part of the money that
would come in through the
increased tuition would go to
student quality of life initia-
tives developed by the
provost’s office. These would
take up $1.25 million dollars,
according to Ramicone.

Provost Maher was out of
the country and could not be
reached for comment.

The increase came out of a
reduction in the State
Employee Retirement System,
according to Tim Reeves, the
spokesman for the govemor’s
office. The system handles the
retirement funds for all state
employees and Penn State, as
well as the State System of
Higher Education. Because it
projected a lower retirement
rate level than was anticipated
by the governor’s office, and
because Penn State had level
funding as well with part of
that funding going for retire-
ment costs, what actually hap-
pened is that Penn State
received a small increase
because its state money would
go farther. Also, the lower rate
meant that the state govern-
ment had to spend less money
across the board. Thus Pitt and
Temple, in order to have parity
with Penn State, received a
small increase, viihich Reeves
said the governor was happy to

go along with.
According to Ann Dykstra,
director of Pitt’s

Commonwealth Relations, the
retirement rates were not the
only reason why Pitt received
more money.

“That’s one element,”
Dykstra said. “The other ele-
ment is that Penn State
received additional money for
agricultural research and agri-
cultural extension services.”

Because Penn State is a
land grant university, it has
responsibilities to do agricul-
tural research and maintain an
agricultural extension ofﬁce in
every county of the common-
wealth.

The additional money in
the appropriation is not the
only good thing for Pitt in the
state budget, Dykstra said.
There are other programs

which Pitt is involved with that
received funding.

The first is called the Link
to Learn program, which
received $33.3 million dollars
for basic education and com-

puter equipment.

There was an additional
$87 million for the state sys-
tem of higher education, the
state-related universities, and
the community colleges to con-
duct an assessment of
Pennsylvania’s technology
infrastructure. Dykstra said
that the goal was to create a
state—wide technology network
which was competitive with
other states.

further into the information

No more financial dropouts!

The Commonwealth, in its infinite generosity, has
given Pitt a slight raise in its appropriations for fiscal
year ‘97. That raise, however, was one of about one per-
cent; Pitt asked for six percent. _

Now Pitt has to decide how to deal with a smaller war
chest for the coming year. Some items that have already
been suggested are a possible tuition increase of 4.5 per-
cent and a reduction in the number of Pitt employees. At
the same time, however, pay raises have been proposed.
How much Pitt students pay for their education now rests
in the hands of the Provost, the Chancellor, and the exec-
utive committee of the Board of Trustees.

Before changes are implemented, an in-depth look
into the effects of those changes is needed. Pitt’s goals as
an institution must be kept in mind, as well as its mission
as a school of higher educationand member of the
Pittsburgh community.

Pitt is trying to boost its enrollment and retention and
improve its standing in the community. With educational
funding under attack at all levels, students are not going
to find money falling from the trees to pay for their
tuition. The community members have to be able to

’ afford to send their students to Pitt. The university must

be careful not raise its costs out of range of those it is
supposed to serve.

Too many students find that after a semester or two,
they cannot afford to continue. These-are not students
who have nothing to contribute, they are not dropping
out because they are lazy, and they are not ﬂunking out.
They are being priced out of the market. This not only
does a disservice to these students, but the university
loses as well. Having able and motivated students makes
the university a better place.

There is also an overall value to society. More edu-
cated people make for a better society. Part of every uni-
versity’s mission is its service to society. This service
obligation must be met by making the resources of this
university available to, as many qualified students as pos-

_sible.

Pitt is also one of the largest employers in Allegheny

County. Laying off workers will not improve community

relations and meet obligations to the community. The

plans to reduce workforce costs by attrition and early

retirement must be considered.

Also, even though people do have to make a living,
the idea of pay raises must be weighed carefully. There
are people willing to forgo pay raises to keep jobs. Any
cutting should begin at the top. Too often, executives
make decisions which create a bed of roses and golden
parachutes for themselves and ignore those who form the
foundation of their organization’s success.

Police in most liveable city unbearable?

Marcy
Denmon

Pittsburgh, once a “most
liveable city”, is gaining notori-

ety as an unbearable city when it _

comes to the police force pres-
ence. About 300 people
marched -from “Freedom
Corner” in the Hill District to
the City-County Building down-
town Saturday in a show of dis-
pleasure with some of
Pittsburgh’s ﬁnest.

Organizers of the march
were the American Civil

- Liberties Union and the National

Association for the
Advancement of Colored
People. Most of the supporters
there were either involved in the
present lawsuit sponsored by the
ACLU or have had personal
experience with some of the
‘-~‘bad apples” in the police force.
These people know firsthand
what can happen when enforcers
of the law stretch the limits of
their duties to the point of crimi-
nal behavior. Police ofﬁcers do
it everyday. The public at large
still isn’t grasping the gravity of
what is happening. Maybe it will
take more innocent people being

harassed, searched, arrested," and’

suffocated before they do.

But these things only hap-
pen to criminals or suspects,
ri t? Sorry to shatter your per-
ception of reality, but these
things do happen to absolutely
innocent people, right here in
the good old U. S. of A. As
Councilman Sala Udin said at
the march,”It is unempowered
people struggling to change their
lives.” .

Three college students are
arrested and held over night in
jail because they sat on the
banks of the Allegheny River
watching a barge. A carload of
people are pulled over and
detained on the side of the road
downtown for an hour because a
police ofﬁcer didn’t like the way
the driver pulled out of a gas sta-

tion parking lot. A man is beaten
in the Allegheny County
Courthouse by six policemen
who then charge him with
assaulting them. He is served
with a warrant from his hospital
bed. These are just a few cases
in which police were found
guilty, charges were dropped, or
no charges were ﬁled.

Cases which are part of the
A.C.L.U. lawsuit include a dia-
betic who was detained 24 hours
with no medication while in a
police station inquiring about
the legality of headlight covers.
Two Pittsburgh residents were
jailed because they watched ris-
ing ﬂood waters this spring on
city property. A nursing mother
is jailed for 14 hours for driving
without her headlights on. These
incidents are only those which
have been reported, occurred in
the city of Pittsburgh, and are
recent. There must have been
thousands of occurrences of
police misconduct in the history
of this city.

Now, after the publicity of
the early death of Johnny
Gammage and the ACLU law-
suit, the public is beginning to
take this issue seriously. Mayor
Murphy has not shown any con-
cern for the welfare of the resi-
dents of Pittsburgh and, in fact,
brushed off the lawsuit by call-
ing the plaintiffs, “malcon—
tenders,” “radicals,” and people
who are “on the fringe.” Pretty
disconcerting behavior for a
leader of the cities police force.
Not surprising though, consider-
ing this lawsuit could do serious
damage to his prospects for
reelection.

No one ever said being a
police ofﬁcer was easy. In fact, I
believe it must be one of the
toughest jobs around. Being able
to weed out real criminals while
upholding every standard of the
law takes incredible wits,
courage, and ﬁnesse. Police offi-
cers who are able to do this
should be promoted and pub-
licly recognized for such excel-

lence. The majority of police
officers I have witnessed and
talked to, however, operate on a
system of intimidation, stereo-
types, and brawling. If they ﬁnd
themselves in a situation where
they have done something
wrong, they change facts here
and there to make what they did
“right.”

Our society is becoming
increasingly wary of law
enforcement. Cops walking
down the street .don’t hear
“hello”’s and “how are you”’s
anymore because people are
afraid to speak to them. The idea
of protecting and serving the
public is foreign; the only things
being protected here are their
own egos.

The march on Saturday is
only one inch in the n1ile—long
struggle of making justice and
true equal treatment for all the
norm in our system of criminal
justice. We as members of soci-
ety have the chance to tell law
enforcement officers how we
feel about police officers who
break the law. We can support
the fomiation of a citizen review
board. We can call our city
council members and tell them
we support a citizen review
board. We can go to the next of
the city-wide hearings on form-
ing a review board, bill 397, at
the Reizenstein School in East
Liberty at 6pm July 9.

As Vic Walczak of the
ACLU put it on Saturday,”Let’s
end the verbal abuse, physical
assault, and public humiliation,
and make courtesy, professional-
ism, and respect the new motto
of the Pittsburgh Police.”
Support respect for human
rights. Support bill 397. Join
with me and many others and
make your voice heard at one of
the upcoming public hearings.

For more infonnation about
bill 397 and the civilian police
review board, call Councihnan
Sala Udin’s office at 255-2134.

Columnist explores history

of the US in the Persian Gulf 

Abdullah S.
Balhaddad

 

In the 17th and the 18th centuries,
the importance of the Persian gulf
was as a strategic place in the middle east to control
ship trafﬁc. The British empire colonized that gulf:
Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, the seven emirates
(UAE now), and parts of south Yemen. The irnpor—
tance of the Persian gulf increased after discovering
huge oil reservoirs.

The relationship between the US and the Saudi
Arabia was officially" started during a meeting

 

between the King Abdul Aziz (Bin Saud) and presi— ’

dent Roosevelt. The president armounced his doc-
trine, which has since been called the Roosevelt
doctrine: the defense of the Gulf states is a vital US
interest, and the US will use all the means for its
defense, including the  The US will not
allow any outside forces (Soviet Union at that time)
to control the gulf. After Roosevelt, every presi—
dent’s doctrine was to defend the Gulf states.

The Persian Gulf has the biggest oil reservoirs
in the world, and the most powerful OPEC mem-
bers are in the Persian Gulf. Around 56 percent of
the world’s oil comes from this area. By the year
2000 some countries, like China, Norway,
Indonesia, and Algeria, will leave the oil market by
being consumers rather than oil producers. Unless
the gulf states increase their production, the oil
prices will ﬂy up. Therefore, there
will be pressure on these countries
to increase their production in
order to keep the oil price stable.

As a leader to the western
countries, the US took the respon-
sibility to keep a continuous oil
ﬂow from the gulf with reasonable

The Kuwait inva-
Si0ll gave the US. mentinthe gulf crisis: the f1m-
the golden chance
to transfer tanks
and heavy equip-

to run the state on his behalf while he was recover-
ing from a stroke. This authority transfer is normal
in the Saudi tradition, but the transfer has reﬂected
on oil prices. A few hours after the announcement,
the oil price increased by $1.20. After the Saudi
Arabia blast, the oil price increased in the Asia
Stock Market by $0.80. The disappearance of eight
million barrels per day ﬁom the oil market would
shock the world. '

As a result of this vitality, there was an attempt
by the Soviet Union and USA to control this region.
The Soviet Union allies were Iraq, South Yemen,
Libya, Ethiopia, and Egypt during the era of Jamal
Abdulnaser. The US allies were the Gulf
Cooperation Countries (GCC) countries and Iran
during the Shah era. When the Soviet Union invad-
ed Afghanistan, the president Jimmy Carter formed
the Rapid Deployment Forces (RDF) in order to
intervene in the gulf for any threatened attack by
Soviet allies, internal revolution, or military coup.
The problem facing these troops was that the RDF
needs weeks to transfer tanks and heavy equipment
to the gulf while the battle will last only for hours.
The Kuwait invasion in 1990 has given the US the
golden chance to transfer tanks and heavy equip-

- ment to the GCC countries and store them under the

umbrella of Kuwait liberalization and the threat of
Saddam Hussein. If the US had brought its troops
before 1990, it may have faced another Vietnam-
like resistance from all the Gulf people. When
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, most of the peo-
ple greeted the US troops in order to defend them-
selves against Saddam
Hussein. Only one category of
the people refused US involve-

damentalists.

During the sixties and
seventies, the people did not
give any, attention to funda-

price. The problem facing the mentalism The majority of the
western countries is that their ment t0 the  Middle East was split between
dependence on the Middle East oil countries socialist, capitalist, or neutral

has increased since WWII from
22 percent to 47 percent. Unless
other resources are discovered, these ﬁgures will
increase after ﬂie year 2000. Therefore, most petro-
leum companies are excavating in different places
around the world (such as China, Latin America,
and the former Soviet Union States) in order to ﬁnd
an alternative for Middle East oil. This focus of
power in this area will increase the sensitivity of the
gulf and cause competition between the three poles
(Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran) to be the gulf police-
man. Any strategic imbalance will cause a disaster
in that area, like what happened when Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.

Saudi Arabia is one of the preferred US allies
in this region. In addition to its location, Saudi
Arabia’s vitality comes from being the biggest oil
producer in the world It produces around eight mil-
lion barrels per day (bpd), which is one third of the
OPEC production. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990, three million bpd disappeared from the mar-
ket, leading the price to ﬂy from $18 per barrel to
more than $40 per barrel. There were expectations
that the price might have increased to more than
$40 per barrel if Saudi Arabia and Fanzawella had
not increased their production. Saudi Arabia
increased its production from six million bpd to
eight million bpd within two weeks. This ability for
immediate response is not available the most oil
countries. These things have given Saudi Arabia a
high sensitivity for any event.

A few months ago, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
asked his half brother, the crown prince Abdullah,

 

citizens. By the end of the
eighties the fundamentalism
started to propagate in all categories of the Islamic
world, not only in the GCC countries. They are in
the university, army, business, labor, and profession-
al occupations. '

However, not all the ﬁmdamentalists believe in
the violence. There is a group between the ﬁmda-
mentalists, the militant fundamentalists (as the
media like to call them), who believe that the only
way to reform the area’s situation will come by vio-
lence and military ways. They do not understand
the new situation after the gulf war. Because of the
sensitivity of the gulf, the existence of US troops
became one of the important factors for the gulf ’s
stability. When the UK armounced its withdraw]
from the gulf in the seventies, immediately Iran col-
onized three islands from UAE and Iraq president,
Abdulkarim Kasim, collected his troops to join
Kuwait. Therefore, the US presence became one of
the facts that should be accepted whether it is
desired or not.

So far the investigation is still at the beginning
and the militant fundamentalists are presumed inr1o—
cent until the investigation is ﬁnished. This kind of
violence was never known in the GCC countries
since the Saudi Arabia establishment in 1932.
However, there are factors whichyhelp to increase
the size of the militant ﬁmdamentalists in the gulf,
which means the last two blasts are only the begin-
ning of a bloody violence.

p Wilborn features Pitt track on ’’Champions’'

The Pitt News
Wednesday, July 3, 1996

Mike Kovak
Sports Editor

Today’s world seems filled with
stars and athletes that always want to
give back to their communities when
the television and newspaper cameras
are shining on them.

And if you believe the tabloids, as

 soon as the cameras are off, the stars

crawl back into their self-absorbed
holes, plucking eyebrows and receiv-
ing breast augmentation, just to name
a couple things.

Former Pitt track star John
Wilborn defies these molds. Although
he could not be considered a star in

t A the vein of most professional athletes,

Wilborn is devoting his time to deliver

educational programs to Pittsburgh’s.

inner-city children on his program
“Champions for Champions” which
airs on PCTV Channel 21, the public
access channel. - -

“A lot of our work deals with mid-

' dle school and high school kids,”

Wilborn said. “We want them to real-
ize how important it really is to
receive an education.”

Wilborn knows first hand the ben-

' efits of an education. He graduated

from the University of Pittsburgh in
1972, where he also participated in
track (on a scholarship) for four years
and football during his freshman year.
Wilborn won the Pennsylvania
Collegiate High Jump title among
other track awards, before he graduat-
ed with a degree in English.

Then it was on to Columbia
University, where Wilborn completed
his Master’s degree in journalism. At
the present, he is an active member of

of USA Track & Field’s Three Rivers
Association, which will host the
Region Two Junior Olympic Track &
Field Championship in mid-July at
Slippery Rock University. He also has
experience at KQV, one of
Pittsburgh’s well—known radio stations
and recently received certification by
the PCTV Board of Directors for
underwriter credit.

The Champions for Champions”
segment Wilborn is currently working
on deals with the Pitt track & field
team.

“This should be on the air some-
time in August,” Wilborn said. “The
program will run 50 to 60 minutes.”

The Pitt track & field feature will
be the fourth installment of the
“Champions for Champions” series.
The show features interviews and
workouts of Pitt stars Najuma
Fletcher, Tonya Mullins, Jay Murphy,
Trecia Smith, Jay Jones, Orrel Green,
and Ayne Allen.

An interesting aspect of the inter-
views was that they deal little with the
world of track & field itself. They
reflect more on what it takes to be
successful off the field (academics)
while being able to balance the gruel-
ing track season, which runs from
October through May and forces the
team to travel to distant places such as
Jamaica and Alabama.

“I would like for it to have educa-
tional notice,” Wilborn said. “I don’t
want people to View it as just asports
show. I want it to be viewed as schol-
arly.”

Few teams at this university can
boast of such an academically accom-
plished group of athletes as the track
team. Wilborn asks each athlete about

majors (they range from engineering
to psychology) and future plans (a few
have their sights set on this summer’s
Olympic games in Atlanta). All the
interviewed athletes have their priori-
ties in order and appear ready to make
a successful leap into the post-college
world.

Wilborn said another reason he
selected to do a program about the Pitt
track & field team was to bring more
recognition and credibility to one Pitt
sport that has excelled for generations.

“Obviously, when local athletes
see this program, I hope that it can
inﬂuence their decision about college,
and that they come to Pitt,” Wilborn
said. “Even people who participate in
other sports, hopefully this could help-
them out some. But as long as they go
to school somewhere, that’s the ulti-
mate goal.” '

Another possible project Wilborn
has in mind involves the Say No To
Drugs program. Middle school stu-
dents entered an essay contest and the
winners might get the chance to
appear on “Champions for
Champions.” Wilborn wants to
address a problem that has seen an
upswing in activity during the ‘90s.

“These days it seems like all kids
do is try to squeak by,” Wilborn said.
“It really scares me. Kids want to take
the easy way out instead of the right
way, not necessarily the hard way.
People shouldn’t expect things to be
done effortlessly.”

Wilborn appears to have done
things the right way and with that
extra effort he could turn around some
minds of inner-city kids right here in
Pittsburgh, helping them realize that
education is a key to life. v

lverson selected first

potential move opens up several
million dollars under the cap in an
effort to sign Shaquille O’Neal,
the prize of the free agent lottery.

The early selections in the
first round went as expected.
Allen Iverson, the energetic point
guard from Georgetown, went
first overall to the Philadelphia
76ers. Marcus Camby, who left
UMass and then reported several
NCAA violations to the media,
went second to Isiah Thomas’
Toronto Raptors.

Vancouver used their first
pick (third overall) to select
California sensation Shareef
Abdur—Rahim, who went higher
than any freshman in history.

The ﬁrst senior selected was
Villanova’s Kerry Kittles. The
crowd at the Meadowlands went
wild as new New Jersey Nets
coach John Calipari selected the
local hero with the eighth pick

The biggest surprise came
with the 18th pick The New York
Knicks had to be sturmed to ﬁnd
Big East first-teamer John
Wallace of Syracuse still on the
board. Predicted to go as high as
sixth overall by some experts,
Wallace slipped for no apparent
reason.

A plot to keep Pittsburgh sports kickin — thcmksWWF

 

Columnist
Matt
Grove

unday night started out as a
Snormal, lazy day here in

Pittsburgh. The three H’s
were present again: hazy, hot and
humid. There wasn’t much hap-
pening that would even cause the
slightest stir among the natives.
This all changed around 6:00 when

downtown began to stir.
It wasn’t the after effects of the

Rib Festival at Three River’s
Stadium. They were not giving
away free I.C. Light down at the
Point. My ﬁiends and I were at a
loss for an explanation behind this
commotion. That was until we
watched the hordes of children,
teenagers and even a handful of
pumped up senior citizens in their
“Undertaker”. He’s got soul, maybe

even your soul” t—shirts that it hit \

us. The WWF was here tonight.

How could we have forgot-
ten? We had our tickets for weeks
and had been practicing our moves
on unsuspecting prey in the
Oakland area all week in prepara-
tion. Maybe all the hype sloshed
around our brains a little bit, maybe
it was something else.

The Civic Arena wasn’t ﬁlled
totherafters,infactitseemedtobe
about half full, but the 8,000 or so
vacant seats only gave the 10,000
on hand more room to get a little
crazy. I don’t mean crazy like
looney-bin crazy; I mean dads
picking ﬁghts with other dads over
who was better; Hulk Hogan or
Ric Flair.

Crazy like middle aged
women with bad dye jobs and
ribbed tank tops throwing them-
selves at the likes of WWF
Champion Shawn Michaels with
reckless abandon. A couple weeks
ago, in this very column, I dis-
cussed how professional wrestling
played a large role in my childhood
development. Sunday night was
just the throwback I needed to give
me that warm, fuzzy feeling all
over again.

The night began with some
WWF promotional messages and
then it was on to the WDVE plug
that paled in comparison to the
show put on by Bubba from B-94.

Bubba began talking about the
interview on the air with the British
Bulldog. The Bulldog did what
many around these parts feel is the
most heinous of all crimes possi-
ble, next to wasting beer: ripping
on Pittsburgh.

When Bubba told the crowd
that the Bulldog said Pittsburghers
were LC. Light drinking rednecks
hesealedthefateoftheBrit.'Ihat
match was lata in the card, but it

was one of the most anticipated

Meanwhile, as the
Bushwhackers grappled the New
and Improved Rockers, I took a
moment to watch how the fans
reacted to this ﬁerce competition.

As the night wore on the
wrestling faithful became more
energized. That was until the
annotmcement was made that the
Ultimate Warrior refused to wrestle
in Pittsburgh, the fans went from
joyous and giddy back to disgrun-
tled and downright pissed.

It was insulting that the British
Bulldog dissed Pittsburgh earlier,
but that was acceptable because he
was a foreigner. But to have the
Warrior, an American born and
bred, ﬂat out refuse to come to
Pittsburgh is going a little too far.
This however, was smoothed over
when it was armounced that the
replacement would be none other
than Psycho Sid, formerly Sid
Vicious. The fans were paciﬁed

Matches came and went, each
time with mobs of fans knocking
each other over in order to get close
enough to the ring to actually touch
someone on anabolic steroids.

As the British Bulldog pre-
pared to face 641-pound
Yokoztma, the Bulldog’s manager,
Jim Comett, went to the micro-
phone with an announcement.

Comett invited his former client,

Yokozuna, back to  Comett.
Comett was cocky, arrogant
and armoying with his words, but
at least he wasn’t dumb like the
Bulldog. When Cornett was ﬁn-
ished the Bulldog took the micro-
phone and gave him his ultimatum.
“Yokozuna, we want to wel-
come you back to Camp Comett
with open arms if you are willing,
but this is the ﬁrst and only offer I
will make to you. If you refuse it
now, I will beat you worse than the
Dallas Cowboys beat the
Pittsburgh Steelers in the Super

Bow.”

Although I tend to root against
the Steelers with great zeal, I must
admit that was a pretty dumb thing
to say. The Pittsburgh fans were out
for blood. Yokoztma declined the
olfer and the match was on. But it
wasn’t the actual match that got my
attention, it was the chants heard
from the crowd

While a man from Britain
was being beaten by a man from
Japan, the fans were chanting,
“USA.” What does this mean, you
ask Itmeansthatwecanbringin
good players that may not speak a
lick of English but can dominate
their respective sport and
Pittsburgh fans won’t care where
he’s ﬁom. They will still get rowdy
and chant “USA.”

They also started to yell,
“Here we go, Steelers, here we go”
in reference to the failed cry of
Pittsburghers all throughout the
winter. That leaves me with my

ultimate plan.

Although I like the plague
more than I like the Steelers, I still
like the city and I want it to pros-
per, so here we go.

From this day on, the day
before any Pittsburgh team plays a
game, whether it’s the Pirates, Pens
or even Duquesne, just mention to
someone that you heard the oppos-
ing team’s star player say Bill
Cowher was really a woman. Or
how about that the Immaculate
Reception wasn’t for real and the
only reason the refs called it a catch
was so that they could get out of
here ASAP. It will work, I guaran-
tee. As I have learned over the
years here in Pittsburgh, it ain’t
matter none what yins say ‘bout
me, but you’s better not talk bad

‘bout the Stillers or we’ll run you
out of town, ‘n ‘at.

Way back in 1992, just before Pittsburgh’s
current wave of ska—mania broke, pulling a veri-

table army of pre—teen grungers, ex—jocks and

ex-punkers along with it, there was a band
called the Skablins.
With an incredibly diverse group of musi-

'cians from all walks of life (including their

share of ex—punks, skinheads, RudeBoys, liter-
ary heroes and art fags), the Skablins single-

handedly forged a then—unheard-of-in—Pittsburgh

appreciation of ska music, at least among the
youngsters. Blazing a now—legendary trail of

 _chaos all over the east coast, the Skaabs (as they

were known by many a teary—eyed young lassy)
underwent several tumultuous lineup changes,
eventually dissolving in much the same way for-

smer guitar player KT Kelly and organ player

Jude.Rude used to dissolve each other’s brains
in cans of warm American Beer (just for fun, of
course).

Since then, guitar‘ auteur (and sometime

S writer) Juddy Hopper has blown away audience

expectations with his experimental PUNK
ROCK group Couch, and, more recently
through his role as co—songwriter for
Pittsburgh’s greatest avant folk—punk band ever,
the Johnsons. Juddy has finally decided to

, return to his roots, putting together Pittsburgh’s

first (and only) All Star Ska Supergroup, with
his new band Bill Fulmer and His Luscious
Young B-3’s. ‘

and Lars Cleath on trombone, sax, and trumpet,
respectively, former Tiny Little Help drummer
Joelle, and the mysterious Megan on fake
Hammond B-3 organ (otherwise known as the
ever—popular Casio keyboard). Whew! That was
a breathful.

The B-3’s played their debut gig at the BBT
a few weeks back, and it’s obvious that the kids
have decided to slow it down a bit since the
“p_ick it up pick it up pick it up!” dancing hey-

sound” is directly inspired and influenced by the
old school Jamaican rock—steady sounds of folks
like Delroy Wilson and Toots and the Maytals.
The band members also give plenty ‘o props to
everyone from Stan Getz and Booker T to Stiff
Little Fingers and the Fall (though they sound
nothing like the latter).

Sister Machine Gun
Burn _
Wax Trax!/TVT Records

Sister Machine Gun
never really claimed to be an
industrial band. Chris
Randall, the main force
behind SMG’s music, prefers
to call it “a conglomerate of
many different styles, a post-
modern soup of a popular
music, with a beat you can
dance to.”

This doesn’t mean that
Sister Machine Gun isn’t
instantly labeled as industri-
al, however. “If you want to
call that industrial, go right
ahead,” Randall says. “I’m
not going to stop you. We
are signed to Wax Trax! after
all.”

Similarities to industri-al
bands like Nine Inch Nails
and Filter abound on SMG’s
first two albums, Sins of the
Flesh and The Torture
Technique, where Randall
received help from many

industrial veterans from
bands like KMFDM and
Thrill Kill Kult. The first
album was received as only
a NIN-clone, but The
Torture Technique received
critical acclaim and put
Sister Machine Gun on the
map as one of industrial-
rock’s best.

The newest album,
Burn, continues the evolu—
tion of SMG with funkier
beats and more guitar work,
with fewer programmed
electronic beats. \Burn
attempts to go back to more
of the dance music roots
from which industrial music
evolved.

The words “funky’ and
“industrial” are rarely seen
together when talking about
a band, but Sister Machine
Gun does manage to achieve

9

‘this unique meld of styles

throughout the album, espe-
cially on tracks like “Red,”
“Hole in the Ground,” and
“Better Than Me”. Yet, SMG
also keeps close to the roots
of industrial music on tracks
like “Overload” and “Burn”,

which was also featured on
the Mortal Kombat sound-
track. (W0weee.’—ea'.)

It is this unique blend
that distinguishes Sister
Machine Gun from many of
the other acts in the industri-
al world. While SMG may
sound like Nine Inch Nails
or Stabbing Westward one
minute, they rapidly turn full
circle and reach something
closer to Depeche Mode or
Wolfgang Press the next.

Randall also wishes to
break the myth that all
industrial bands are angry
and frustrated. As a result,
Burn ’s lyrics sway from all
the angst that exists in the
industrial camp. Randall
attempts to create lyrics of a
more personal nature, and
has compared his lyrical
work to that of Snoop Doggy
Dogg, Chris Isaak, and John .
Lennon — hardly influences
of the common industrial
artist.

While the lyrics push
SMG in one direction, their
musical style also has them

guitars are pushed to the forefront rather
than keyboards anddrum loops. Randall sees

‘ SMG as being much closer to a rock band on

stage than an industrial one. “I do hit on
keyboards for certain songs,” he says, “but I

mostly play guitar because it looks cooler.”
Randall will be showing oﬁ‘ his cool gui-

known as the Decade) tonight at 10 p.m.
