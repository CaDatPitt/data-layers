Boiler Trouble Causes

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Widespread Blackout,

Overall Power Failure

The failure of a boiler at Duquesne Light Company on
Thursday morning resulted in an overall power failure at
the University, throughout Oakland, Downtown, East Lib-
erty, and other sections of the city. _

A large generator was taken out of service due to.the
boiler mishap. This, coupled with the failure of power links
to West Penn Power and Pennsylvania Power Companies
resulted in the wide-spread black-out which, according to W. S. Gil-
ﬁllan, Jr. of Duquesne Light lasted no longer than the hour of 9 to

10 a.m.

The only serious disturbance on campus occurred in the Towers

and Student Union elev.ators
where students and office work-
ers were trapped between floors
for nearly a half hour.

A similar problem was avoided
at the Cathedral elevators, ac-
cording to Dispatcher Byron De-
bee, “The elevators just happened
to be at the ﬂoors,” Debee said.

The Cathedral elevators have
an alternate power system. The
Cathedral elevators,, h o w ev er ,
were simply ‘shut off. The power
failure, said Debee, wasn’t long
enough to necessitate a switch to
the alternate power system.

Two secretaries who work on
the ﬁfth floor of the Student
Union were not quite so fortunate
as the - passengers on the Cathe-
dral elevators. Mrs. Mary Hersh-
kowitz, of the Dean of Men’s Of-
ﬁce, and Mrs. Milly Baer, secre-
tary to David Epperson, co-ordi-
nator of the Equal Education Op-
portunity Program (EEOP), spent
nearly one-half hour stranded in
a SU elevator between the fourth
and ﬁfth ﬂoors.

“We were frightened,” Mrs.
Baer said. “We both have claus-
trophobia and felt we couldn’t
breathe and that we were getting
dizzy.

“We opened up the door that
said emergency phone, and we
found a handful of wires,” Mrs.
I-lershkowitz said.

“Milly offered me a sandwich.

“We wouldn't smoke because it
would use up the oxygen.

“Our main fear.” Mrs. Hersh-
kowitz continued, “was that no
one would know we were in
there. ' '

“But we soon heard Mr. Epper-
son’s voice reassuring us,” Mrs.
Baer added. “An audience was
waiting on the sixth ﬂoor to meet
the survivors, We’re laughing at

p.m, in Clapp Hall Auditorium.

He will attempt to clarify the
nature of explanation of scienti-
ﬁc theories. Professor Bromberg-

er will discuss how explanations

are discovered, how they differ
“Om. resemble, and include dis-
coveries of new facts. He will
also examine explanation in gen-

do it again.”

All areas of the University
were affected by the power fail-
ure. Presbyterian-University Hos-
pital, for one, found itself work-
ing well under such stress con-
ditions.

Wayne Long of the Hospital B

Public Relations Office remarked
that power failure “of course
touches off a tizzy of excitement.
I checked the operating room;
this is where the danger exists.

“When the lights went off,” he
continued, “there was an imme-
diate switch to emergency power
which came out of Scaife Hall.
There was a serious brain op-
eration in progress, but the staff
was well-trained and there was
no problem.”

University professor Jack
Kolbert is the biographer of
the “world’s greatest living
biographer.” ~

Dr. Kolbert, who was per-
sonally selected by the fam-
ous Andre biographer him-
self, journeyed to France last
year to begin his research on
Andre Maurois, a man who has
written between 80 and 100 pub-
lished volumes. 1

Dr. Kolbert, ‘who is chairman
of the Department of Romance
Languages, described his subject
as “fertile” for an 80 year old
man. “He does nothing else but
write,” Kolbert said, adding that
Maurois believes that if one has
the will, half the battle is won.

“His work is exceptionally well
constructed,” Kolbert emphasized.
“I don't think he‘s capable of
writing a sentence that isn’t ele-
gant.” Besides being a famed bio-
grapher, Maurois has also writ-
ten histories of the United States,
France, and Great Britain. He
has completed several novels and

JACK KOLBERT

is an active contributor to mag-
azines, with a total of 8,000 arti-
cles and prefaces to his credit.

Maurois chose Dr. Kolbert to
write his biography because he
was impressed with a book Kol-
bert had written on the French
critic, Edmond J aloux.

, Folksingers Peter, Paul
and Mary don’t sing to fur-
;:ther the liberal movement.
~_When they sing about the
~.“hypocrite turning back”

-their primary motive is not
social protest, but rather the
‘expression of their emotion in
song.

'_ “We sing what moves us,” «ex-
plained Paul Stookey, the tall
member of the trio. If a social

;the folksingers, they’ll sing it.
l“But we're not looking for so-
‘ cial protest songs,” 'Stookey said.
; Peter, Paul and Mary, although
fclosely identiﬁed with the “We
-Shall Overcome” group of folk-
‘singers like Bob Dylan and Joan
‘Baez, do not consider themselves
 that group. “Bob Dylan and
Joan Baez have a cause. They’ve
found something they believe in,

time ﬁghting for it through song,”
Paul said.

to arouse emotion in anyone else.

Peter, Paul and Mary don’t sing ,

It doesn't matter to them if they
sing “Puﬂ', the Magic Dragon” or .
“This Side of Jordan,” as long as
the song suits them, and it
sounds good. ’

Peter Yarrow explains that
perhaps folksinging is a protest.
“Folksinging reﬂects the times,”
he explained. “It’s the voice of
the common people. It tells of
their woes, their heartaches, and
their jobs.” Right now folksing-
ing is basically, a protest move-
ment because people in our so-
ciety have become aware of the
social injustices of past ages."

Peter explained, however, that
folksongs weren’t always a pro- .
test, nor would they always be
a protest. Puff is as much a folk
song as Blowin’ in the Wind or If
I had a Hammer. But it's not so-
cial protest. It’s just a nice chil-
dren’s sing.”

He removed his sunglasses and
stared across the room. “You
know,” he said, “folksinging has
a tendency to identify‘ with the
liberal movement. It will for a
long time, because the liberal
movement wants to better the lot
of most of the people. The lib-
eral movement seeks improve-
ment, and so does folksinging.”

When the social protests pass,
Peter, Paul, and Mary will sing
about something else. They know
that they have enjoyed success
because of their talent, their abil-
ity to communicate with their
audience, their ability to put their
feelings into the songs they sing.

When they lose that ability to
communicate,» they’ll quit. “I

won’t prostitute myself for folk- '

singing,” Peter explained. “It was

Biographer’

 Kolbert Authors Biography    
Of ‘Greatest Living

Working from an oificeinMau-
rois' mansion, Dr. Kolbert was
able to watch Maurois in his own
habitat. He found Maurois “ex-
tremely charming, cultivated, and
terribly generous. He has an ob-
session to produce faithfully, yet
he is too generous with his time,”
Kolbert remarked.

In his novels, Maurois’ char-
acters are from a leisurely class,
a class that seemed unrealistic to
Dr. Kolbert before he went to
France. Once he saw Maurois’
life and his friends, however, he
realized that his novels are as
realistic as those which depict
the poorer classes. “He paints the
world that he sees,” Kolbert
noted, classinz this is as a. defect

‘ in the sense that Maurois‘ imagin-
ation is limited.

Dr. Kolbert was struck by the
fact that Maurois was as recog=
nizable to the French public as
a movie star would be in Amer-
ica. Often’ waiters would get
ﬂustered and customers would
whisper and not in their direc-
tion when Maurois and his bio-
grapher would walk into a coun-
try tavern on a sunny afternoon.

After his visit, which he had
preserved in part on tape, Kol-
bert realized the “importance of
studying the climates in which a
man produces and lives.”

The Student Union Board So-

Musical variety is being intro-
duced to satisfy students who

Student Works for Police it

By VICKI EPSTEIN

“I’m proud that I’m wear-
ing the uniform of a Uni-
versity Security Policeman.
It’s a symbol of hope for
someone who sees it and
needs assistance,” civil en-
gineering senior Stan Sha-
lita explains about his part-time
job.

Security work at the Univer-
sity involves checking buildings
for illegal entry, ﬁres and broken
pipes. Shalita’s working area is
called the “interloop” because
his beat loops among the differ-
ent University buildings on the
hill. A full-time student, Shalita
serves eight hours a week in
uniform.

Shalita began in police work
when he joined the Civil Defense
during high school. He also
served as an auxiliary policeman’
on constant call and directed
Sunday morning church traffic
near Clarkson College of Tech-
nology in Potsdam, New York,
where he went to school for a
year and a half before transfer-
ring here. He chose police work
to help ﬁnance his education be-
cause of the pride he has in the
job.

Other University students do
not seem to respect the “Univer-
sity cop” or his uniform, Shalita
noted. The law enforcers who
wear these uniforms deserve the

Carnegie Education Foundation

Cites Need for More Teachers  

‘ (C'olleg'iatetP/ress Service)

American colleges and uni-
versities will need 35,700
new teachers by 1969-70,
and they will have to revise
their teaching methods in
order to get them, accord-
ing to a report issued by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Education.

The report said thatthe ma-
jor source for these teachers-
doctoral programs in universities
— will be producing only half
that number. And based on past
experience, only about half of
the doctoral holders — about 9,-
000—wil1 actually enter teaching.

The report, written by John W.
Gardner, foundation president,
said that teaching has lost its

status at most universities —

especially teaching of undergrad-
uates — as professors have been
lured by increasingly rich re-
search assignments and have of-

ten given up teaching .altogether.

“As a rule,” he said “the
university administration is so
busy struggling to maintain the
strength of its huge graduate and
professional schools that it ne-
glects the undergraduate. And so
does the faculty.”

Gardner made several sugges-
tions aimed at easing the pending
teacher shortage;

—Establishing a new degree
short of Ph.D. for those who do
not really need a doctorate.

—-Shortening the period be-
tween bachelor’s and doctorate

_ for those who do choose to go

on.

—Creating ﬂexible retirement
Policies so that effective older
professors can continue to teach.

--Encouraging and using tal-
ented women.

—-Enlarging the total supply of
talent by reducing the waste of
economic and social ‘deprivation.

This -has happened to the University in the past few years: no longer is only a

 ‘small group of student leaders ﬁghting for issues with little support from the rest of

the student body, but students at large are concerned and cafeteria talk has moved to
some fiery discussions of the Advising Center and women's housing regulations.
Students who were never interested before —- Phi Bet candidates who considered

portantly, are beginning to care.

turns into a popularity contest of students

looking for prestige, Student Government

as a whole will accomplish nothing. If some of t-hese students recently excited about
school affairs would prove their interest, this could be the strongest organization ever.
If these students are sincerely concerned, let them commit themselves.

Sorry, Nobody

01116

 by Jada Katz

Much has always been
said about the faults and
problems of the advising
center here and at many oth-
er schools. I have heard
complaints ever since I came
to Pitt and I am sure that
they will continue long af-
termost of us have left this
school. Yet there i's one
problem which I only first
met this first

  
  
   
 
  

  am led to be-
. ,lieve has been
going on for
‘ some time,
" ' 3 but which has
1 n o t b e e n

MISS KATZ before.

This year circumstances
forced me to drop one
course and add another,
something which happens to
many students. When I
went to my adviser, I was
told by one of the depart-
ment secretaries to fill out
the add and drop slip and
leave it to be signed. If I
had any questions about my
schedule that was my tough
luck because my adviser
has refused to see any stu-
dents for the first three
weeks ' of this term!

IS THIS FAIR to the
students? It certainly is not.
I had had
talks with people over va-
cation and I knew what I
wanted to do. But there
were students t-here who did
have questions; who were
unsure of exactly what they
intended to add or drop.
These students did not and
are not receiving any bene-
fits from having an advisor.

, If a student attempted to
ask the secretary a question,
the answer received was “I
don’t know.”

During a student Union
Board Panel discussions last

 term, one student brought

out the fact that ‘his adviser

it ' has refused to see him any
, time. He explained, that the
, secretary in his department

 

registers all the student ma-
jors of that department.
When he asked to see his
adviser, he was not allowed.
And when he asked if he
could change his adviser, he
was also not permitted.
FROM TALKING with

other students, it seems evi-.

dent that this problem exists
mostly with the upperclass
advisers. It is certainly not
all of the advisers. It might
only be a few. But even if
it is only one, it still must
be corrected. One possible
reason for the problem
could be attributed to the
fact that there is usually
only one adviser in each de-
partment, no matter how
many students are majoring
in that department. In de-
partments where there are
many majors, then, the ad-
viser is often over—loaded.
Each underclass adviser
has approrimately 150 stu-
dents to advise. Yet should
there be 300 or even more
students in a speciﬁc major,
that upperclass adviser has
300 or more. students to-
work with—sometimes more
than twice as many as the
underclass adviser. Is it any
wonder that some of the ad-
visers feel that they do not
have enough time to see
each student who needs help
at the beginning of a term?

in

     
 

One of _America'sﬂ'7TrLe-(u

The f'act that some ad-
visers are over-burdened
with student advisers is not

a legitimate excuse for the‘

adviser not to see any stu-
dent who has questions dur-
ing the ﬁrst three weeks of
a term. If this is the major
reason for the existence of

‘vthis problem, then I feel it

is up to the advising center
to correct the situation.
LATE LAST term, when
the advising center was the
topic of much discussion,
James Watson. assistant to

_the' dean of the School of
-Liberal Arts and head of

the advising center, made a
statement which said, in ef-
f'ect, that the improvements
in the underclass advising
system have not been felt
by the upperclass students.
I realize that we can’t ex-
pect improvements o V e r —
night, but this is one im-
provement which can and
should be made quickly. If
one upperclass adviser has
300 or more major students,
then two or more advisers
should be assigned to that

department. Why shouldn’t‘

the adviser-advisee ratio be
the same for the upperclass
students as it is for the un-
derclass ones? They often
need as much assistance
with their schedules as the
freshmen and sophomores.

Tyrannical Prof
Angers Student

Editor, The Pitt News:

For the past several years our
university has desparately been
trying to attain the reputation

of an Ivy League college. The .

construction of dorms, libraries,

art buildings and even a gyinna- '

sium are the outward manifesta-
tions of this attempt.

Students themselves show signs
of this change. The recent pro-
posal by the Women's Housing
Board for off-campus housing
and unrestricted curfew for sanc-
ior women and the onslaught of
letters to The Pitt News attack-
ing faculty apathy represents the
undergraduates reach for an Ivy
League atmosphere.

But how can these be achieved
when there are professors who
refuse to recognize the emotional
and intellectual maturity of their
students?

The ﬁrst meeting of one of my
courses reminded me of my first
day in grade school. Room G024
in the Cathedral was packed
with college students listening to
a lectureon discipline. In a class
of this size one can understand
an instructor making a fetish of
absolute silence and attention.
However, I do not feel that 30
minutes time had to be devoted
to this subject.

Adding insult to injury, the in-
structor read very slowly so that

his children could take down
\ every word. He was kind enough
b to spell out the difficult ones

like medley and satire. His gen-
erosity exceeded all bounds when
he repeated each point that
would be on the true-false test
at the end of the week.

Our second meeting started
much the same. Prior to assign-
ing permanent seats, the profes-

sor began the harangue. Just as"

he was near a state of eloquence,
a boy in the last row dared to
ask his neighbor to remove a
coat so he could sit down. For
this sin, the young man was told
to leave the class and drop the
course. The bad element expell-
ed, the diatribe continued.
Fortunately, or unfortunately,
I did not hear the end of it. I
remembered .a similar speech

Letters to the Editor

 
 

 

T lT?— WELL. I'LL FEEL

  

and I started to grin, myyhand
discreetly covering my mouth.
Yet even sitting in the back of
the room, I was caught in the
middle of the horrible act, and
too, was told to leave.

Perhaps I am a coward. I have

decided to take another course.
I have already made the decision
to transfer to another university
some time ago. Therefore, the
fate of this university means lit-
tle to me. '

But what will happen to this ?-
university and its students when

professors such as this are allow-
ed to teach? When a school hires
and keeps a teacher whose au-
thority and self-esteem are so
precarious, whose methods of
teaching are outdated and unin-
piring, and who fails to see the
worth of his students, it can
never hope to achieve a reputa-
tion as a ﬁne institution of high-
er learning.

O O O
Draws Criticism
Editor, The Pitt News:

After enduring 15 exasperating
and unproductive weeks of So-
ciology 180, we feel that the So-
ciology Department should make
a sweeping re-evaluation of the
course with regard to the present-
ation of material and the format
of the examinations.

Even though the content of
the course proved interesting in
itself, the caliber of instruction
and the method and content of
the examinations negated any
worthwhile beneﬁts which could
be derived from the course.

When one expects to gain
knowledge of general concepts,
one least expects to gain a
knowledge of general concepts,
one leasts expects lectures and
examinations to be cluttered with
irrelevant facts and ambiguous,
picayune questions.

The course and its caliber of
instruction are hardly consistent
with the “image” of liberal edu-
cation which the University is
attempting to project. In short,
and with regard to $147, “we
wuz robbed." .

C More Graduates Increase Traditions

Universities Grow in Social Importance 

(Collegiate Press Service)

As the percentage of
American college graduates
begins to move toward 50
per cent of the population,
universities will assume
more attributes of such so-
cial institutions as the church
and state.

The ramiﬁcations of such an
event are multifold, but above
all, the university will become
increasingly embedded in the
crust of its traditions.

Practices and concepts which
originated when the university
was a far different institution
will keep their momentum, sacri-
ﬁcing the realities and exigencies
of the present to the false secur-
ity of the past. .

The most immediate parallel
to this situation lies in American
politics: even the so-called prag-
matic politics ‘of the center deals
in cliches and slogans from an-
other era. -

In that same era, and before,
the university was an institution
for the intellectual elite. Both in-
tellectual and elite are important
words, for while they are the
anchors of higher education, they
are no longer deﬁnitive.

population which used to receive
much apart from’ society. The

university functioned in an ideal-
istic atmosphere. Philosophy
reigned; every subject from the
sciences to the arts was studied
in a philosophical context. Lib-
eral education deﬁned the con-
cept of breadth and’ depth; the
Renaissance Man.

By making education at lower
levels possible for virtually every-
one, the United States created
the foundation for the inﬂux of
numbers into the colleges and
universities, a phenomenon which
has been picking up speed for
a generation.

This trend has thoroughly de-
stroyed ‘the foundations of the
elite. While it is perfectly pos-
sible that the “community of
scholars” might have broadened
to accommodate the new num-
bers, this has not happened in
fact. Only a‘ very small percent-
age of the University of Michi-
gan’s 29,000 students is faithful
to the tradition of liberal educa-
tion. In short, there is now an
elite within the elite. A large ma-
jority of students are here sim-
ply because higher education has
become a prerequisite for mid-
dle-class life.

At the same time, knowledge‘

_has accumulated at such a fan-

tastic rate that most men have
forsaken any comprehensive

‘ grasp of its boundaries. This has

led to a rigid compartmentalize-
tion. The specialist dominates
while links between ﬁelds grow
weaker. A new ﬁeld begins by
crossing departmental lines; it
ends by becoming an entity in
and of itself.

I am talking about two sep-
arate groups of people both di-
vorced from the traditions of uni-
versity education. The ﬁrst is an-
ti-intellectual. Its followers move
automatically from high school

   

The university bemoans the
lack of values of its students, but
it should not be surprised. The

so-called community is so frag»

mented that there are few shared
values. In theory, the university
remains true to the historical.
principles of education; in prac-
tice, it cannot communicate these.
principles. Education is a status.

symbol or a vocation; it is no .

longer the means to a better
society. ' '

to college to $200,000 more per
lifetime. The second is a-intel.
lectual. Its followers are schol-
arly, but they have lost touch
with the philosophical base of
education and consequently have
narrow concerns.

Hoopsters Meet
Injury - Riddled
W V U Tonight

By FRANK SMIZIK

MORGANTOWN, W. Va. — The Panthers face
the tough assignment of playing the Mountaineers
of West Virginia on their home court tonight. Al-
though the Mountaineers, this year don’t have a
star of the stature of Rod Thorn, they still have a
7-5 record.

Three regulars are injured and they didn’t play
in the Richmond loss. Leading scorer Bill Maphis
and playmaker Rick Ray are not at full strength
while Buddy Quertinmont has a injured hip.

Last year a strong Panther team won at home
convincingly, but lost here. The home court, how-
ever hasn’t been the problem for the Jungle Cats
as much as poor shooting percentage.

The Orangemen of Syracuse rolled over the
Panthers Saturday night 97-73 as the Panthers could
only manage to shoot 27.3 in the ﬁrst half and 35.1
per cent in the second half. The Panthersare shoot-
ing a poor 30 per cent after eight games.

While Pitt was inept from the field Dave Bing
was scoring on his ﬁrst ﬁve shots of the game.
Bing wound up the night with 25 points and 14
rebounds. Syracuse also connected on 50 per cent
of their shots.

Bob Lovett was the high scorer for the third
straight game for the Panthers as he poured in
21 points. Larry Szykowny was next high man with
15 points. It was the fourth loss in ﬁve games for
coach Bob Timmon’s hoopsters. ’

The fate of the Panthers tonight will carried on
WWSW with game time at 8 p.m. Jack Fleming will
do the play by play.

O’Kom, Baily
Lose Matches

By BILL CABIN

Michigan frustrated the wrestling team in their
opening meet, deefating the matmen 2'1-11 Saturday
at the Field House. In winning their third consecu-
tive meet, the Wolverines were without starters
Bill Johannessen (137), Lee Deitrick (157), Rick
Bay (167), and Chris Stowell (177).

The matmen lost consecutive matches in the 147,
157, and 167-pound classes. Frank O’Kom and Carl
Jenkins were tied 3-3 after two periods, but Jenkins
got sufficient riding time in the third period to win
the 147-pound match.

Although Deitrick and Bay did not make the
trip, the Wolverines still won the 157 and 167-pound
matches. Tom Baily appeared to have the advantage
in the opening of the 157-pound match, but Michi-
gan’s Jim Kamman surprised Baily by pinning him
at 2:08 of the ﬁrst period. Dave Post had a near
fall on George Huson in both the second and third
periods, giving him the decision in the 167-pound
match.

“Michigan didn't have their best lineup,” said
coach Rex Peery. “We should have had the 147 and
157-pound matches. We're really hurting."

Captain Lee Hall broke the losing skein winning
a fall against Tony Felock in the 177-pound match,
but Bob Spaley pinned Bill Bodle in the first per-
iod of the heavyweight match.

Tom Heniff decisioned Toni Lambros in the
123-pound class by gaining riding time in the third
period. Don Caslow battled for two periods, but
Michig,an’s Bob Fehrs won the 130-pound match,
pinning Caslow with 33 seconds left. ,

The matmen wrestle at Syracuse this Saturday
and will face two of the best heavyweight wrestlers
in the East. “If they've got Everling and Jim Nance

back, they’ll be tough,” said Perry. Everling and Nance wrestle at
191 and heavyweight, respectively.

“Otherwise it should be a good well-matched meet,” said Peery. 7
Mlke J ohnson’s return could be a key factor in the meet. Johnson
has been recovering from a knee operation, and he may be ready for

Syracuse. Bill Beck, a heavyweight, also rejoined the team this week.

McKinnis, Saco Spark Victory

Gymnasts Conquer Slipp

By TOM SACKS

Dave McKinnis and Jim Sacco com-
bined last Saturday to carry the gym-
nastics team past Slippery Rock, 70-50, in
the ﬁrst meet of the season.

McKinnis placed first in the three
events he entered——ﬂoor exercise, side
horse, and still rings. Sacco outpointed
Ron Sopata of Slippery Rock in four of
six events to win the all-around perform-

ance. _
Misage.

“I was pleased in spots," said coach
Warren Neiger. “We still need plenty of
practice. It takes time to work up rou-
tines which have an even ﬂow. At times
today it was pretty obvious that a smooth
ﬂow was lacking and the judges took off
heavily because of it.”

“McKinnis is a hard worker and he’s
in good shape,” continued Neiger. “He al-
ways seems to come through for us in the
meets. Sacco in spots was above my ex-
pectations. He quite frankly surprised
me‘)!

Noticeably handicapped by the
academic ineligibility of six play-
ers, the Cubs were handed their
first loss of the season Thursday
night 73-62 by Slippery Rock’s
Junior Varsity.

Starters Bill Borellis and Bill
Buck were among those who fail-
ed to make grades. Coach Carl
Peterson, however, refused to
blame the loss on this fact alone.
‘fWe were out of shape because
of the three week layoff,” Peter-
son said. “No team can get back
into shape in only three nights
of practice. Arid Td_on’t- forget that
Slippery Rock‘ 1had played the
night before. 'nie§ were in much

Maryland handed the
swimming team its second
consecutive loss, 62-33, last
Saturday at the Terrapin’s
home pool. Coach Bill Camp-
bel1’s Terps placed ﬁrst in
every event except the 400 yard
free style relay while’ extending
their record to 5-0.

Tim Ribarchak, Mike Olesak,
Gary Martin, and Andy James
composed the team which swam
the relay in 3:25.0 for the Pan-
thers only ﬁrst. Co-captain James
also ﬁnished third and second in
the 50 and 100 yard free style
events while Martin, in the 200
yarder, and Ribarchak, in the 100

' yarder,-both grabbed third place

the 50 and 100 yard events. Bill-

Nullmeyer and John Harding
monopolized the free style events
by winning the 200 and 500
yarders.

Panther Dick Hulme swam
third behind Mary1and’s Bruce
Philips and Jim Green in the 200
yard individual medley. Hulme
and Bill Fitzgerald ﬁnished two-
three behind Tom Manfredi in
the 200 yard butterﬂy event. Phil-I
lips also outdistanced Russ Lind-
‘berg and Bob Dattola in the 200
yard backstroke.

Terrapin Bob Livermore out-
pointed co-captain Ed Coleman

and teammate Jim 1VVIcCaslin.~t0
' win the diving event. ‘  

The only area in which the gym team
faltered was on the long horse, where it
was outpointed by Slippery Rock, 11-5.
“We*ve been hurting on the long horse
‘because we usually don’t have enough
space to practice on it,” said Neiger.

The Panthers swept the side horse and
horizontal bar exercise. Placing behind
McKinnis on the side horse were Roland
James and Sacco. Sacco placed ﬁrst on
the horizontal bar, followed by Tom '

“I was expecting a better performance
from Misage,” said Neiger, “but he fouled
up a half-turn in the giant swing and
that hurt him.”

The lowest performance ratings in the
meet were exhibited on the trampoline
which has just been added to gymnastics
competition this year, Gary Barr won ﬁrst
place easily.

A major disappointment was lg Perez.
Entered in four events, he never placed 
higher than third. “Perez is capable of
much better,” said Neiger.

‘- feels the recent ruling by
the Eastern Collegiate Ath-
letic Association on spring
sports will benefit his team.
The December 11 ruling by
the ECAC permits university ath-
letes to compete in spring sports
without attending school during
"the spring trimester.

Lewis said he had several pros-
pects last year who had to work
during the spring, who did not
have sufficient time to play base-
ball and attend school. With the
elimination of mandatory atten-
dance in the spring trimester,

=.-these students will have time to
play baseball. O

“I don’t feel the ruling will
be of any particular beneﬁt to

tennis,” said coach Ben Pope. “
“Our problem won’t change until

we get our own courts.”

The tennis courts are part of I 
the new athletic complex to be  m I 
completed by the Spring of 1966. . |

Pope’s main problems are tran-

sportation and the trimester. ’ _
