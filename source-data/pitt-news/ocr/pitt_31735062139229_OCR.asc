THE NEVVHBOARD

' “The new PITT .WEEKLY ‘board

, extends greetings to

the students,
alumni and faculty of the University.

The staff, which has just completed

its term of. service, takes ‘With it the

S ' heartiest congratulations of the whole
institution for their success and faith-

ful performance of their duties. Too

.A much praise cannot be given them for
‘-the standards to which THE WEEK-

”{Froi_n a-monthly literary journal, “The
Courant,” to one _ofv'the most ﬂourish-

ing University ‘Weeklies in the coun-

.try,~is. the record offthe past three
boards." With the news systematically
gathered and Writtenup according to
journalistic principles, ,t'he PITT

NVEEKLY has reached a place of real

efficiency as‘ a’ newspaper, its columns
have been spicy and: have grown to
be a requisite of -the University life.
The sporting page has been thorough

and expressive of the “dope” and bids.
“fair to continue in that capacity. Of

all the members of the past year’s
staff it can be said——w
their able and conscienti labors.
The staff appreciates -the “glad
hand” proffered them by our. prede-
cessors.‘ We realize t-hat journalism
is a profession and" recognize the
value of trainedtmen and newspaper
precedents and there,for-e.wi‘ll gladly
-receive all advice and suggestions
that may be of assistance to ‘he ef-

. A forts 0 this half dozen men». ,

In der to .make this paper con-
tinue in t-he success t_hat_it has en-
joyed .there are duties that every stu-
dent and faculty member must per;
form. News must reach the staf£..Re-
porters will gather all tlfat is possible,
but as any “one knows,.’A there’ are
events that pass -unnoticed. This
happens becau‘se’t‘he studentsfail to
report it.‘ No'item is ‘too trivial; no
eventof too l’ittle.conse‘<i'uence to be

‘ . brought to the noticepf the reporters.

If it ‘be merely asuggestion it will be
gratefully received‘ anﬂ investigated.

.Again. ‘the sentiments.,and' wishes ’of

our subscribers are necessary in? order
to fulﬁll. our purpose. Remember the

‘news box in Thaw Hall and drop in

notes of anything of interest to you,
ofyour ideas or suggestions.

and faculty should subscribe to the
remaining. :issues andiread the paper.
Bear inmind thatthis is yourpaper,
your representative. and act accord-

ingly. Instead of the few on the staff
let us have every one connected with

the University take interest enough to

9 make himself a‘ staff correspondent.

Then. and then only,_ will the PITT

 AVVEEKLY be a success."

Muskingum College, New Concord,

 Ohio, will be the next place that the

men‘ will_play.. Nothing deﬁnite is
known of the _str.engA_th _of the team
representing this institution this sea-

, turned out some f'ast_te'ams. The next
‘ .day the playerswill move over to Ada,

Finds Alleghen‘yCo1lege Easy Pick-
i_ng——F,inal Result e11-3.

 

 

The varsity baseball team‘ opened
the season by takingrevenge on Alle-
-gheny College for the basket ball. de-
feats ‘received last winter. The score
was 11 to 3. «

Har-enski pitched great ball, hold-
ing the Methodists to four scattered
hits.- In addition he knocked out.a
three—baggT=:r. ‘, ‘ ~

Robinson, who pitched a , no—hit
game against Carnegie Tech last»sea—
son, was on the mound for Allegheny.
A total of "seven hits was "gathered
from him in’ six innings, including.
triples by_ Dillon and Harenski.
-Ricker, who relieved him in the sev-
enth, was touched for six hits, two of
which were- for extra bases.

Considering that this'was‘ the‘first
game of the season the boys played
great -ball. ' “ _ V . ‘

Thqmembers of the team were
royally entertained -overnight at the
various fraternity houses,
possible being done to makethem
have a good-time. , '

Three—base hit —-‘Dillon, Harenski,
Honaker,‘Robinson. Two-base hit —-
Wilson. S.truck out—By Harenski, 7;
by "Robinson, 5 in 6 .innings; by
Ricker, 4'in.3 innings. Base on balls

Allen, 7, (Crossan 2, Hawk, Gilbert 2,
Richards 2). Sacriﬁce hits -— Dillon,
Allen, Harenski- ‘Umpire——Kelsky of
.Spirella’s. Scorer——Grove.

conﬁdent that the Pitt team will have
a good season. ,

Daily practice games are being
played and in thismanner the ability
of the men is being brought out.
There is no -position on the team that
has been isettled for the rest of the
season and every man that sticks with
the squad has a chance‘ of making
good even if he has not ‘been put on
,the ﬁrst team so far. i A

The trip next week -will show the
strength of the team and if any weak
places-are -found the coach will have
ample time to make _stror_ig the weak
spots before the games with W. &'J'.

PITT MEN. OFF  

The University of. Pittsburgh relay
team, which will run in't‘he,University
of.-Pennsylvania games at Franklin

ACapt. J. W. Rosenthal, Wallace B.
Thomas, Matt Marshall and Harry D.
Shoff. The ﬁnal heat VVednesday be-
tween Shoff and “Red” McDonald, the
fast little sprinter from Hawley. Prep
School, resulted in a victory for the
former. Shoff ra_n a fast and heady
race, his time being as good as any
negotiated in the trials. McDonald’s‘
shoe caught in" the turf on the second
lap and he was forced to give up his
lead. , . ,
Director of At'hletics C. S. Miller
isn’t quite decided how he will run the
‘local boys, although Marshall will
probably lead off. Shoff will run the
second‘ quarter. Rosenthal the third
and Thomas will wind up the race.
Short and Thomas are both freshmen
in.the School of Mines and will run
their ﬁrst relay race at Franklin Field.
Capt. -Rosenthal has been on the team
for three years for Pitt and had pre-
viously competed for Pittsburgh Hig_h

A School there. i.Matt Marshall ran on

the relav team last year. The four
Boys mentioned form the fastest team
of quarter milers_the University ever
sent to Philadelphia. They will com-
‘pete against Lafayette,.Rutgers, New
"ork University, Michigan Aggies,
Trinitv and Johns Hopkins; I

Manager Chalmers Hall ‘left with
the team last eveningat 10:40 o’clock
‘for the [Quaker City, McDonald’ going
along to compete in the dashes. Sholf,
who is a member of the Cap and Gown
Club. which ‘gives its annual play at
the Alvin to-day and, to-morrow after-
noon, will go Friday night.

xeﬂarlani Elected H   A
  Assistant Coach

, Univer.si.ty of’ Pittsburghiwill have
another Princeton football star of All-
American fame to work with Head

 

ner for the Blue and Gold next fall,
the’ announcement being made that
E. H. W."(Nubs) Harlan. oneiof the
best backﬁeld men the Tiger‘ ever
had, and _Walter CairLp’s choice for
one-of the half back positions on his
mythical All-American tea-rnsof 1907,
would pair with Duff. -As the Pitt
was an All—American‘ line-
man, the itt football situation seems
to be in very capable hands. 3

. Harlan"sf home .is in Baltimore,
where he is an attorney. He played
on the Princeton varsity for three
-years, 1905, 1906. and 1907, and‘later
returned to Old Nassau as a varsity
coach for"two years. He was rated
by Walter Camp as the bestkicker
of the year 1907. He was also a ﬁrst-
class drop kicker, and negotiated a
ﬁeld goal against Yale that .year... As
Pitt will have to develop kicker? ow-
ing to the graduation of Captain Gal-
vin, Harlarl’s presence will be doubly
.valuable.' * ' ‘ ‘ ~

ltiis rumored that “Dick”'Hoblit— F

against the.Varsity at Trees Field to-
morrow afternoon,
that the managerof the Alumni team
has sent a telegram to Manager.“Joe”
Pinker of the Reds, asking‘ that

“Dick” be permitted to come to Pitts- '

burgh __Saturday and-. play for- the
Alumni._« If “Joe” will grant this re-
quest and Hoblitzell is inclined*to
make the trip to Pittsburgh, for the
sake of helping to defeat t-he»Varsity
in the ﬁrst- home game of the season,

the old Pitt star willibe found atthe “

initial sack to-morr-ow‘ ‘afternoon.
However,.we think that the “if” isof
sulﬁcient magnitude to put out of the
question any possibility of havi_ng the

great player of the Reds participate in «

the game. ,

Regardless of whether this great
star IS in the game or not to-morrow,

give the regulars the battle of the

team that have the “goods.” They

may-he getting a little old, but”they' A  A

have the speed to last about one-good

have nothing. to think about but‘ the
one game that they play to-morrow
and if they can win that game, or
even play a reasonably ‘decent game
against the men ‘that represent "Pitt

have done all -that -is required of them
along ‘baseball lines for the next 12»
months. '

Manager

Grove stated yesterday

that thelineup of the varsity for the

game to-morrow will be practically

the same as that of last Saturday, and A

the men will put forth every effort,‘
as they do, not look upon the game
as an easy one by any means. Har-
enski will be on the rubber, according
to the dope at the present time, and

it is likely that Thounhurst, one of

the greatest pitchers that~ever wore
a Pitt uniform, will be on the ﬁring
line for the Alumni:

It is probable that a large crowdiof .

rooters will turn out to see the ﬁrst

home game of the season, despite the .

fact that the Chicago Cubs and "the
Pirates are booked to be making
things hot at Forbes Field." The stu-
dents are anxious to- see the men in
action and toiget a chance to size up
the team before it leaves on_ the west-
ern trip, which is scheduled .to com-
mence on Monday. ’ ‘ A ’

The probable lineup of the teams’

to-morrow is:

In commenting upon investigations
which have been made and are now
being conducted in conservation as
applied to ﬂood prevention, , Mr.
SchOles_sa-id that no‘ deﬁnite practical

“ IMPROVEMENTS ON CAMPUS.

 

With the shaping’ and‘ grading of
the’ campus nearing completion. a
squad of men is busy setting out trees
