Senior Court shoved aside its ma-

turned to its legal duties and tried‘
more than twelve‘ co-ed‘ cases dur-

dealt with offenses ranging from
violations of freshman customs to
indiscretions in dress. j

Most of the offenses dealt with
violations of freshman customs". To
come before the Senior Court a
freshman had to be caught violating
the sophomore code three times. A
combination of three such felonies
as sitting on- a bench in Alumni hall,
entering the main door of State" hall
and failing to wear a green arm
band brought the offender before the
court. Sentences in these cases took
the form of compelling the girls to

period, or to wear f‘Pecavi” signs.

Musical
Annual Banquet Of Pitt
Downtown Club.

 

By ELLA CHALFANT
Downtown Correspondent

Pitt Business Women's club held
its annual banquet and election of
officers at Heinz House, Saturday
evening, January 19. . .

The election resulted in -choosing
of the following oﬂicers to direct
the club’s activities for the year,
February, 1929, to January, 1930,
inclusive: Ethel Morrow, president;
Evelyn -» Lemley, vice president;
Frances Beard, secretary, and Helen
Anderson, treasurer.‘ ’ * .

Miss Evelyn Lemley directed
group singing, with Miss Frances
Beard at the piano. Between courses
of the dinner Mrs. ‘Frank Troup, of
Chicago, sang ﬂseV‘8_1'al delightful
solos, her sister, Mrs. Helen Downs,
being accompanist.

The toastmistress was Miss Nell
McKenry——the very first resident
of Pitt Business Women’s c ub-—_-who
recalled the humble beginnings of
the club amon the few women stu-
dents of the owntown Division. At
the ‘ present time, with the great

numbers of women enrolledin the

Downtown Division, such ‘an organ-
ization is almost »indisp’ensable.,

Each woman enrolled is eligible
to membership, as well as faculty
members" and wives of the faculty.

The keynote of vMiss McKenry’s
‘talk was “Contacts.” Pitt Business
Women’s club closes another suc-
cessful. year, and great credit is due
the social chairman, Miss Ethel
M_orro'w,_ as‘ well as the other mem-
bers of the executive committee, for
the activities carried on.

The nominating committee, with

I Miss Mabel Belcher-as‘ chairman, is

to be congratulated on its selection
of candidates this year. The con‘-_
stitution of Pitt Business Women's’
club is rigid in its requirements of
consistent membership and the mat-
ter of credits earned before a mem-
ber‘is~ eligible; and, in _addi.tion to
fulﬁlling these, ‘each member of the
new executive ‘staff has worked for
the interest of the club‘ in various
capacities. We anticipate a very
"prosperous year for Pitt Business
their leader-
ship.

 

Director  Nluseuiii,
Speaks To Sigma Xi

“The animal populiitionyof North;
America and Eu asia show certain
traces of aﬁini y,” declared Dr.
Andrey Avinoﬂ‘, director of the
Carnegie Museum,’ in his talk “Some”
Zoogeographical Relationships of
the Old World and. the New,” ._be-_'
fore a meeting. of the Slg‘Il’l8'}'\l
Alumni Association, January 23, at

Th-aw hall.’ Continuing Dr. Avinoff .
said: “A comparative study of '-the ‘

distribution ‘of insects, particularly
butterﬂies and moths, leads one to a-
conclusion that there existed a land-
bridgefconnecting the continents of
America and Asia, taking the place.
of the present-Bering Strait. It" may
be considered that.s_ome seven per
cent of North American species of
butterﬂies are. in common with rep-

resentatives of the-' same group in.

the ‘Old World. Among these
holartic species none: was found to
be conﬁned to American soil, prov-G
ing thus that in no case, did, such
species enetrate over so_me former
land-bri ge between the European
and North American continents.”

DRU-IDS .TO CONVENE

HERE IN SPRING _

 

Preparations are under way for
the Druids’ n-atfional convention to
be held herethis spring, with dele-
gates from Penn State, 'Bucknell,__
Carnegie Tech, University of Dela-
ware, Washington and Jefferson and

ance. ‘ ‘

Peter, Col. ’31, and Richard Hamil-
ton, Col. ’31, to assist him.

ing delegates are being arranged

considered for rental.

James Lindsay, Bus. Ad. ’30,
former president of the Pitt chap-
ter, was elected national secretary
and treasurer of the organization at
last year's convention at Bucknell
University. _,

MISS MILLS CHOSEN
SENIOR COURT JUDGE

Adelaide ‘Mills, Ed. ’29, has. been
chosen by the executive committee
of W. S. G. A. to ﬁll the vacancy
left on Senior Court by the resigna-
tion of Sarah Long, Col. ’29, in com-
pliance with the requirements of the
point scale system. ‘

Miss Long, as president of Phi
Mu, national social fraternity, W.
S. G. A. representative from Senior
Court, senior mentor and treasurer
of Y. W. C. A., could not carry the
additional points which membership
on Senior Court gives. Miss Mills

first W. S. G. A. meeting after the
holidays. She is active in Pitt Play-
ere, Glee Club and is a member of
Chi Omega, national social frater-
nity. -

Pitt Students Buy ’
i Fewer Bool<s——Nleese

Pitt students are buying fewer
text books in the opinion of Harry
E.’ Meese, .manager of the Univer-
sity book store, after a .preliminary'

‘comparison of sales last year and

this. -With the second semester rush
soon to begin, Mr. Meese declared
that.incomplete ﬁgures for first se-
mester -sales showed that between
_70' and 75 students out of 100 pur-
chased text books in the average
class, while in some cases the ﬁgure
wasas low as 60. Last year, he
siifyted, the average was 80 out of
1 .
More - than 60 requisitions have
been made upon the book store for
next semester textbooks, and about
90 more are expected. said Mr.
Meese. Because of the great demand

-upon publishing houses at this time,

it requires a week to have an order
ﬁlled, he added. Consequei_i_tly,.in.
order that books. be here _the first
day of .the new semester, orders
must. be placed at the store by Feb-

‘ ruary 4. This means professors must

estimate the number wanted before
they, know t1ie- size of their classes,
unless they are willing to wait for
their orders until several days fol-
lowing -the semester opening. The
‘_b00l{ _s_tore then ‘4‘cuts” the orders
‘as past‘ ‘experience’ advises, "in" order
not to overstock, said Mr.-"Meese,
for it is not privileged to return
any books except’ '20 -per cent. of
those _on introductory orders: '

I ‘Beautifying Program

‘ An extensive program of work by
university employees with the view
of beautifying and improving the
buildings andgrounds of the cam-
pus is being carried out under the
supervision of John A. Weber, busi-
ness‘ manager of the university.

The corridors and. walls of State
Hall are being replastered and re-
painted. ’ Although no additional

 

fworkmen have been hired for this
$199_ The statement refutes the. ;;W01'k said M1‘. Weber, the work in

State’ Hall is going ahead. The
painters ‘are working at night and
should be ﬁnished within a month.
A preliminary coat of white paint is
being applied, but it has‘ not yet
been decided whether" the corridors
and walls will be ﬁnished in gray
or buﬂ’. " _

.»The telephone wires. that were
formerly carried between State and
Thaw halls by wooden: poles have
beenylaidgp in underground conduits.
In St'ate._-I-I~all,. the. telephone wires
that ran. along the walls have been

duct 9' successfulaffair wig year ‘transferred to conduits behind the

plaster. Because.-' of the many oﬂices
in" university, buildings, a new
switch-board. has been installed in
State H_all‘to facilitate’ the easier
handling. of calls to and from" the
campus. Twenty , years ago when

the old switchboards were first in-

stalled there were eleven oﬂices in
State Hall, while today there are
over ﬁfty. - .

To; beautify the upper portion of
the campus ﬁfteen "hundred bushes

 ‘ "members of the ‘teain.'.are.;as much ‘
or even. more responsible for the

“score‘:t_han. the . man who made'it.

Pitt System Tops-Many

Our system at Pitt is one of the
ﬁnest in. the . country. When the
score is close or when the other
team is too good‘ individually, it.is
mighty good to know that we have
a system_ to‘fall back on to get the
“two pointers.” Speaking ‘of systems
recalls the time ‘and energy spentto
perfect each play that is a vital part
of the game, Coach Carlson’ andhis
squad‘ started practice in the. last
part of October, almost two months
before the ﬁrst game. Usually the

ties do not ‘report~until‘ a onth or
less before the ‘first game. ' .

_ Coach Car_lson’s' complicated‘, yet
tremendously ‘efficient system, takes
a long time to master. Even during
Inid-season,‘ changes are“ made for
the smoother and better workingof
the _machine.' _W_hole- days are spent
on _one or two important: points, and

, even when practice is over"our work“

continues. Wefgo. over the plays in-
our minds at times‘ during the_ day
andbefore we-go to bed;-f ‘  ‘.2 ‘

Our regular practices‘ -usually‘ last
from. about 4:30,, to ,.7:30. o’clock in

Eighteen Players ‘Awarded
Varsity Letters At
Annual Fete

"Albert “Luby” DiMeolo, Col. '30,
stellar Panther guard for two sea-

varsity at the annual football‘ ban-
cmct, held Saturday night at Hotel
Schenley. _ .

The eighteen players
Maria er David Stewart, who re-
celv letters and took part in the
election, are, Joe Donchess, A. L.
Corson,_ Phil Goldberg Ray Mont-
gomery, ex-Captain Alec Fox, Tom
Parkinson, Charley E d w a r d s,

Scanlon, Captain-elect A1 DiMeolo,
Jim Rooney, Al Guarino, Markley
Barnes, Eddie Baker, William Wal-
inclius, Mike Getto and Harold Wil-
liams. Following the announcement
of the election of DiMeolo, the vote
was made unanimous upon the sug-
gestion ‘of ex-Captain Fox.
Luby Has Good Record

~A long_ series of successful ath-
letic exploits lie behind DiMeolo,
who should make a capable leader
for what looms as one of the best
teamsin the history of Pitt «foot-
ball. He first attracted attention in
the sports world while a student in

town he still resides. He was a
three le§ter man, taking part in
football, basketball and track. His
high school record gained him an
invitation to attend Jimmy Hughes’
During his two
years ‘it the academy, DiMeolo par-'
ticipated in -football, basketball,

Upon, entering Pitt in 1925, Di-
-Meolo became a candidate for the
‘Panther baseball and football fresh-
.man teams. He was a -member of
‘the’ last frosh ‘baseball team Pitt
had, and earned his numerals in both
sports‘, The following year he earned
hislﬁrst varsity football letter. Dur-
‘mg the 1927 season, the star Pan-
ther guard was declared ineligible
for athletic competition along with
Jimm Rooney, expert «punter. Last
year? _'Meolo returned tothe squad.
and held down his guard. position in
"superb" fashion.
 To Hold Testimonial _
w DiMeolo is a member of Theta
Kappa Nu, social fraternity, and is
the ﬁrst man the local chapter’ has
ever had at the helm of the Pan-'
ther varsity grid team. The Theta
Kapps plan to pay ﬁtting tribute to
the Coraopolis boy with a testi-
monial dinner February 10.'A1umni
and active inenibers in charge of
the dinner include Henry \G. Ber-
genzer, Edward C. Smith, Earl
‘Weimer and James V. Funaro.
 Although the election of the cap-

ning, numerous ‘speeches, under
Toastmaster Carlton G. Ketchum,
the presentation of The Pitt Weekly
horseshoe trophy and‘ a dinner made
thebanquet one of the most suc-
cessful since Pitt ﬁrst honored her
gl’_id_ teams by féting. Over 500, per.-_
sons attended.

nition of their winning the interfra-
ternity horseshoe tournament.‘ .
In the ﬁrst address of ‘the. eve-
ning, G. Dixon Shruni, '25, spoke in
behalf of the‘ alumni and told the
gathering that the “grads” were
proud of the record of the, team and
the Panther coaches. Ex-Captain
Fox, one of the lightest ‘linemen
ever to play for Pitt, then spoke in
praise of his teammates. ("He cited
the spirit of Mike Getto, in particu-
lar, who played’-in the Penn State
game despite a serious injury.wFox
closed by naming Coach Sutherland
the greatest coach in the country.

Largest Crowd Of Year Sees
Panthers Lose By
40 to 35 Score.

..-..-

Coach, Stadsvold’s gang of hefty
Mountaineer basketball men proved.
that strong reserve material is a
whale of a. help in the hardwood
game, when they nosed out Carl-V
son's phantom five in one the
greatest basketballdgames ever [een
onthe local ﬂoor, last "Friday night,
40_ to 35. From start to ﬁnisli, the
contest was a toss-up, neither team
holding -more than a six-point-lead
at "any point during the battle.

Friday night’s affair glrew the
largest crowd that has ever wit-
nessed a cage game in Pittsburgh.

» ‘The game was a. series of thrills
and excitement from the initial tip-
oﬂ. The Panthers started off with a
swift offense" that threatened the
strong West Virginia guards, Baker‘
tossing the ﬁrst counter with Hyatt
following with a foul goal. Not to be
0 ii t d o n e, ﬁatcliife, Mountaineer
guard, tossed a foul, which. seemed

Glenn, who -started his spectacular

basket, and Lepera came back a
moment later to give his team a
one-point margin with another per-
fect shot. Hyatt ‘then brought the
‘crowd to its feet with an almost im-
possible shot from the side line.

, On the first play of the third
stanza, Poison Paul ‘Zehfuss found
an: opening and tossed a pretty shot
from the foul line, followed almost

Les ‘Cohen. Charley Hyatt pounded

play and left the Pitt enthusiasts
crying for joy. when he looped in the
third consecutive tally with ghost-
like ‘display of beautiful basketball,
giving the locals a six-point lead.
Pitt lost the lead late in the third
quarter when the Panther defense
began to weary of the chase and

‘Virginia score soared as ‘a result of
the ﬁve tallies which he made in
the short space of ten minutes.

Varsity And Froslr Teams Of

February 26.

 

Pitt's Golden Panthers triumphed
in their second game of the season
with Carnegie Tech, Wednesday
evening at‘ the Tech gymnasium.
After a" determined comeback in the’
second half, the Tartan passers
failed to top the Panther lead and
lost, 35 to 28. Char1ey,Hyatt, Pan'-
ther forward, grabbed the laurels
forthe evening with ﬁve ﬁeld goals
and three fouls. ;

Coach Carlson's men Jumped oﬂ‘
to a comfortable lead shortly after
the start of the game, Hyatt scoring
four of his ﬁve tallies during the
ﬁrstghalf. With the same team play-
ing during the second "half, Coach
Irwin’s Tartans revived to make a
threatening assault on the Panther
lead, with Crum,_ forward, and
Nease, guard, tossing some of the
prettiest baskets seen on the Tartan
ﬂoor.

West Point Is Pitt’s. Second
Undefeated Opponent.
_ Of The Season

Pitt’s Golden. Panthers meet their
second .undefe‘a.ted opponent in as
many weeks when they stack up
against Coach Leo Novak’s West
Point passers tomorrow night at the
stadium in a basketball game which
is regarded as the biggesthome at-
traction of the season. , A capacity
crowd is expected for the event.

When Coach Stadsvold, and his
West Virginia quintet came to Pitts-
burgh last Friday, they were
heralded as the best team in the his-
tory of the school and boasted an
undefeated record. Coach N ovak and
his Army ﬁve have amassed an even
more ‘imp'ressive"1ist of scores and
indications’ point to“ an interesting
evening for both‘ teams; and au-
dience. . . ' .

Coach Novak Is Great Leader

The Army ‘coach is known as one
of the outstanding cage mentors of
the country and his annual product
is always a formidable threat to the
aspirations , of every opponent.
Among this year’s Army victories
are Princeton, New York University
and Lehigyi University. The. New
York team was nosed out in the last
minute of play, Armyj taking. the
game, 29 to 28. The Lehigh game,
another close one, playedlast Sat-
urday, ended with the Army leading,
29’ to 25. .

The locals have -apparently re-
covered from the sock on the jaw
that they received at the hands of
West Virginia’s Mountaineers... last
Friday night at the stadium‘. A stiff
work-out,-following a two-hour men-
tal session on Monday, served to
work the Panthers into a spirit,
which, if maintained, will present a
battle even more interesting, than
last Friday’s affair.

Smarting under the sting of the
West Virginia disaster of lastweek,
which was the ﬁrst home defeat in
two years, Carlson's men have re-
solved to'ti_1rn back the West Point-
ers. This week's practices ' were
strenuous iaffairswith the Pitt‘ coach
pushing his men through a--series of,
long fastﬂoor drills. Unless some
improvement is shown, it is - possible
that Carlson will present a shifted
lineup Saturday evening. However,
the game. with the ‘Carnegie Tar‘-_
tans, last .. ‘Wednesday evening,
served to keep the Panthers in trim
and Carlson expects yesterday’s and
today's workouts to put . the Pitt
men on edge for tomorrow’s en-
counter. '

Army Scouts Pitt"

When, Pitt was" struggling with
West Virginia, last week, Coach
Novakgand his assistant were in the
stands, taking in the show with
eagle eyes. The dope_ that he re-
ceived whenreviewing the-‘ contest is
enough to warrant a good deal of
attention on the; part of ,spectators
when they view the type of defense
that he has prepared to combat the
antics of Chipper Cholly. Hyatt and

PITT RIFLERS pnorssr 1 ,
MATCH WITH, wrommay

Last week the Pitt riﬂe team) shot
the best they knew how, thinking
that they were battling Wyoming-'

University, but when the Wyoming."

scores were received, the Panthers
were in for a bit of sad news. ’

Wyoming had fired from a‘sitting'
position instead‘ of a standing posi-
tion. According to Major Horsfall,
“the rules call fr a standing position ‘
and it is much easier to attains.
higher score from a sitting posi-_
tion.” Pitt has written Wyoming
explaining that they would not
‘count the match because of the mis-
Enderstanding as to shooting posi-
ion. -

The Panther riﬂers are shooting
with Mississippi Aggies, University
of Washington and V. P I. this.
week. They have defeated Columbia,-
and V. M. I., suffering their lone
setback at the hands of Syracuse. ’

.Dr. Coleman rifﬁth, associate:
professor of psychology and direc-
tor of research in athletics at the
University of Illinois, spoke- on

dents,” before two hundred members
of the student body and members.
of the faculty, last Friday at Heinz
House.
Dr. Griﬂith suggested that the de-
velopment; of a prope_r,_,frAame. of_
mind and‘. attitude is ‘essential to‘
one’s‘ human welfare. .He further
‘suggested that justjas life itself is
‘evolutionary, so_ are the concepts
which influence it. Many college ‘stu-
dentsare astounded to ﬁnd. that re-
ligion is a changing concept, but,
according‘ to Dr. Griffith, it must
change. .Sex,_ too, should be looked
upon as a perfectly natural -thing.
With all these ‘changing. inﬂuences
Dr. Griﬂith says-, that ‘we should act‘
lik: man who has aspired. to.-great
heights rather than an amoeba,.and
that we should .devel_op a_ high mo-
raleiand-; a ‘realization that there is
a future to which we"may aspire;

Silverinan Presents Cameo.

Glass:Replica Of Antique
.To Chemistry Museum.

» Dr. Aleimnder Silvermankhead of

icliemistry department, has presented ‘

to the chemistry museum 9. full
sized Cameo glass replicaof »the fa-

.mous Portland vase, one of. the

three reproductions of this vase» in
the _U. S. This copy is the finest
‘example of Cameo glass in exist-
ance.

’The Portland .-vase, which is now
in the Gold‘ Orn‘am’ent Roomof the
British. Museum, was_ the work of
an unknown Roman artist of the
first century A. D. It was discov-
ered betwee’n 1625 and 164.4 in’ 8
-mould of earth’ called Monte de
Grano, which was three miles from
Rome. -

Laborers, digging in -the mould,
‘perceiver that it covered a‘, large
vault which contained a sepulchral
chamber enclosing a sacophous of
excellent workmanship. Within» this
was found the sepulchral urn which
became ; known» historically as  the
Barberini-Portland vase- For a cen-
tury the urn was placed in the libra-
‘ry of.the BarbeArini1.family of Rome.
After the library was dispersed. the
vase wasppurchased by the Duke «of

Portland‘ in 1786;:

Josiah Wedgewood, a ‘famous pot-
ter__ of Etruria, England, had‘ de-

purpose’ of‘ reproduction.‘ ‘Portland
lent Wedgewood the..vase"~wh_o after
arduous l-abo‘r‘”produced several ex-
cellent copies.

The copy, which Dr. Silverman
purchased while. he was abroad last
summer, .is_ one; of the‘ three repro-
Aductions of‘-this famous vase in the
