Intra-Club Activities to
Feature ‘Girls’ Debating

That club activitiesﬂrather than
intercollegiate debates'will be em-
phasized on the new program of the
Co-ed Debating club was the decision
reached at the initial meeting of the
organization last week. However, the
tentative schedule as previously an-
nounced still holds good, it was de-
cided. 2

Girls may try out for varsity
debating without being members of"
the club, providing they take’ an ac-_
tive part in club activities, stated
Theresa Kahn, coach.. The club ac-
tivities include discussions, argu-

ments and practice in public Speak- tor Albert Beebe _believes that in

Foster, J r., graduate manager of non-_

“About the only way to make up the-‘

Straney As Executive

 R I Secretary of Y.M.C.A.

Agnew K. Van-Tine has been ap-

University. of Pittsburgh Y. M. C.
A. to succeed M. D. Straney, who
left Friday night to take up new
work with the city, association of
Salina, Kansas. The announcement
was made at the banquet held in the
First Baptist Church-Friday evening

- in honor of the retiring secretary,

by Dr. S. B. Linhart, chairman of
the_ board of management of the
University “Y.” Van Tine will be-
gin work about November 1.

_Many of the closest associates of

here during the past ﬁve years were
present at the banquet. W. E. Both-
well, secretary at the Oakland
Branch Y.  C. A.; William Fen-
nell,. who held the chair at Canton
‘College, China, last year, and Au-
brey Wolford, gave short talks of
appreciation of his many accom-
plishments. A chiines clock was
presented toVStrane'y by Albert F.
Randolph, president of the “Y” cab-
inet, from a group of friends. Jim
Godfrey, of “Y” Hut fame, then
gave Straney an electric waﬁle iron
for remembrance. Two vocal solos
by J. Curtis MacBurney, leading
man of last year’s “Red Moon,” con-
cluded the meeting. Straney left
with his family for Kansas imme-
diately after the banquet. _

Van Tine comes from the Law-
renceville Y. M. C. A., where he was
director of boys’ work. He is re-
sponsible for the idea now in prac-
tice there of bringing in University
students to help in the boys’ work.
Van Tine entered the University of
Pittsburgh in 1916, but left the fol-
lowing year, upon the outbreakof
the war, to enter the air ‘service. In
1919 he returned to the University,
and, among other things, became in-
terestedin “Y” work. He was pres-
ident of the “Y” cabinet for one
year after M. D. Straney had been
appointed secretary. .

He graduated in 1921.and entered
the Pittsburgh Theological . Sem-
inary. Later he went to New York
where he studied at the Union The-
ological Seminary, taking an active
part at the same time in the Boys’
Work at the Union Settlement House

to Pittsburgh, he was appointed as-

Y. M. ‘C. A., and later took charge
of 'the<.Boys’.*Work where he intro-
duced';,_numerous- id_eas._ After an
‘;oi5j§é'i1cé"or ﬁve yearshe returns to
the'U'niversity to take up the tasks.

_ Varsity “Set” ‘

The victory over’ Colgate has
fired up the Pitt crowd, and a team
ﬂashing the «football which Captain

.Mc-Millin’s boysshowed in the Col-

gate game will be hard to beat. ‘The
development of the team this season

.haé,: naturally, been gra-dual’, as

thejiyfe were seven holes to be takgii
card of -by graduation, and the hard

games at the very ‘outset made the

path of Coach “Jock” Sutherland a
rather rocky-§one. It was to be ex-
peeted, therefore,‘ that the team
coiild not go into the Tech game
without a defeat, and those who are
familiar’ with conditions feel that
eveiljyoiie shoijildbe satisﬁed that the
Lafayette game only is on the

tory over Colgate was a notable one,

-:was» to "increase attendance. _ » We
"doubt the eificacy of this prescrip-
gtion because the difference between
a. dyed-in-the-wool fan and a radio»
‘ football‘ fan ' is . one » of . interest; and

which

{‘what‘ better medium than the radio

‘could possibly be employed to stimu-
late their interest to, a degree. _Where
-they would ’ take their football

 of the consideration due our disabled

rule. The ‘editors will do allin their

 to‘ co-operate with campus

{the sake of the readers of the
paper, that activities co-operate with

solve these problems, and would give

It might be explained that the

‘number ‘of’ bulletins used by the
‘Downtown, Division is. so much in ,A
excess ‘of the number of _bul-leAti.ns.A  , _~:
used by other schools, because. the .‘jAA Y _

COLGATE WILTS
BEFORE PlTT’S

  SAVAGE ATTACK

 

Sriff hiélalléih "t  "tih‘gof‘ a third
-Straight Lafayette defeat, the

Pitt ‘Panthers staged a Vbrilliant up-—.
set in defeating Colgate ‘University, ,

19-16’; in _the Stadm.IrT1 last. Saturday-
The ,Victory was more than pleasing
in view of the fact’ that the defeat
was fiC?o1gate’s ﬁrst in two years and

that.-1 Pitt-.,,,was the- u.I1de1'd08‘- _.1-3-St .

year-,9 Col-gate. was ranked next. to
Dartmouth for -.Eastern_ champion-
ship ihonors because of its record.

The weatherman also upset the
dope“’in ‘offering "a real football day,
just '_V_ "enough" moisture and chill" to
keepfjthe players and the 20,000 spec-
tators active. T_ _
active -spec.tTators were the. 5,000
school children who attended the
game on _ -the special admission
charge.’ ' - - V
The game showed a marked im-
provement in the playms Of. the
Panthers. .’ .. ..  ‘ T .'

One of the feature plays of the

game] ca‘n_1ej in:-“'the' latter part of the

o ening ’ch'ap‘ter -when Fischer, play-
IliI1)g‘ his first game in the backﬁeld,
scored the second touchdown as a
1-esu1’t~,_of a 25-yard run after receiv-
ing of pass from Welch. His inter-
ference took one man after another
out‘of the.p1ay. Fischer’s work.,was
commendable in that he ran the 25

. yards -after «having hurt his side T
The injury

earlier in the game. _
forced him to retire in favor of

Rooney for the remainder of the

game. _ _ '
Colgate received two points in the

last quarter through an unusual safe-

ty. Rooney apparently had kicked
out of danger from behind his own
goal line when the ball was brought
back:-by-the referee and Colgate was
credited with two more points. The
ruling was made because _Rooney had
steppedout of the playing field in
making the long punt.

In the dying moments of the
game the Maroons added seven more

passes after an entirely new Pitt
team faced them. Brewer received a
long passfrom Mehler for a touch-
down and Shaughnessy added the ex-
"_V'tTby placement. _T T

_ T7-fistood out for the visitors
as a clependable line backer. Shangh-
nessy was the Hamiltonian’s best bet

   

in ad,y.ancing the ball"  lineT'_‘.'
