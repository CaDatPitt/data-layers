Annual Pitt jobs fair

to benefit minorities

By Ugochi Oyoyo
Staff Writer

At least 60 different companies
will gather in the Ballroom of the
William Pitt Union for the Fifth
Annual Minority Jobs Fair on
NOV. 10.

Opportunities available

W through the fair are not limited to
upperclassmen, select fields of

study, or even to currently en-
rolled students.

’’If you're a freshman, you can
get an internship, and if you're a

, sophomore, yOU can get entry-

level employment,” said Wilhel-
mina Tarpeh, one of the fair’s two
coordinators.

”Alumni participate so they‘

can broaden their career perspec-
tives and increase their employ-
abi|ity,” said James. Raymond,
assistant director of Student Ac-
tivities.

”This year, we strived to in-
clude every major offered at Pitt,”
said Tarpeh. But some courses of

Students and Youth Against Ra-
cism, an affiliate organization of

the All Peoples Congress, is

mobilizing high school and col-

’ lege students to ”Stop the Klan”

on Nov. 5 in Philadelphia, the

same day the Ku Klux Klan has

called for a ”White Power Day”

‘demonstration in that city's

historical district.

The APC and SYAR sent
numerous leaflets to college cam-
puses around the Philadelphia
area, such as Temple, Rutgers,
Swarthmore and the University of
Pennsylvania, asking for students
to join the anti-Klan demonstra-

«tion, and they received a

”tremendous response,” accord-
ing to Ray Ceci, a Philly-based
APC volunteer.

This successful response comes
just after the SYAR held a region-
al conference in New York City,
at which groups from over 30 col-
leges and high schools pledged to
mobilize and stop the Klan.

”Youth [from] all around this
country have a tremendous stake
in opposing racism. Racism is
used to uphold inferior schools,
lo'w paying jobs and discrimina-
tion of all types. The Klan preys
on demoralized white youth.
Youth is ready to fight,” said
Jelayne Miles, national coordina-
tor of SYAR.

”We would like to see an over-
whelming number of people at
the demonstration so [that]
perhaps the Klan won't show

up,” said Ceci.

John Weiss, a Philadelphia
based KKK representative, was
unavailable for comment.

Ceci explained that the SYAR
formed from the APC, which’it—
self formed in response to cut-
backs in social reform spending
under the Reagan administration
and out of what the organization
sees as a rise in racism during the
Reagan years. ‘It was formed to
combat racism, particularly on
college campuses, and to spread
egalitarianism to the geiieral
public. .

Members of the APC and SYAR
do not believe that the Klan has
the right to exist anywhere in the
world because they are a terrorist
organization, according to an
APC spokesperson. ,

”We don't believe this is a free-
dom of speech issue. They're not

protected any more under the-

First Amendment than are drug
dealers,” said Ceci, in reference
to the fact that drug dealers
would not be allowed to promote
the sale of their products through
public demonstration.

Carmen Roundtree, a New
York City based APC spokes-
woman, believes that the K|an’s
right to speak is a moral issue,
rather than a legal one, and that
groups such as the American
Civil Liberties Union (an organi-
zation dedicated to the protection
of all people's rights to free
speech without concern for ideol-
ogy) perceive their actions to be
moral, even though she believes
the Klan has no right to be pro-

tected for any reason. i

”Everyone has their own views
on morality. The ACLU does
some very good work.

”But I don't believe the Klan
has the right to speak [out] —— like
Hitler didn't have the right to kill
Jews,” she said.

According to Roundtree, in re-
cent years the Klan has demon-

strated in other cities, such as_

Washington, D.C. and Atlanta,
Ga., and the APC has been there.
She said that at many of these
demonstrations, the Klan has
been escorted politely out of
town by the local police. This-has
outraged Roundtree and others
within the APC and has led them
to believe that sometimes the
police and the Klan are, at least
ideologically, one and the same.

According to Ceci, ’’In several
cities where the Klan has ap-
peared, the police have been
quite vigorous in protecting
them. In the '60s and '70s,
studies of large police stations,
such as [those found] in Chicago,
many police officers were iden-
tified as being members of the
KKK. We're not saying that every
cop is a Klansman, but in gener-
al, there seems to be close ideo-
logical identification.”

”The police and the Klan go

hand and hand. They wear blue.
suits by day and white sheets by

night,” said Roundtree.
Theresa Young of the Philadel-
phia Police Department's Public
Affairs Office said in response to
accusations that members of that

because they have different
recruiting processes and aren't

sure if this kind of recruiting will
work for them,” said Tarpeh.

”Work is such a monumental
part of our lives,” said Robert
Hopkins, director of placement
services. ”Employment is the way
people acquire success, status,
improve their self worth, prepare
for old age or their children's fu-
tures, and even find life more
pleasurable.”

Programs such as this fair ”sub—
stantially increase students’ read-
iness for their job search” if they
don't ‘already have adequate
career information, said Hopkins.

”It provides growth in under-

standing what work is, what bus-

iness is, what drives it and how
to succeed in it.” C

Angela Gordon, a CAS junior
studying communications, plans
to ”see if [she] can meet the stan-
dards and requirements for a job
as a speech pathologist” through
information that will be available
at the fair.

One freshman, Alicia Smith,
considers the fair ”very valuable
because most freshmen may pick
[a field of study] without know-
ing what it takes to do it or what

other options are available to *

them.”

The local toll-free cancer in-
formation hotline has met with
more of a demand than its
founders anticipated when
they established it in July.

”The need is greater than
what we thought when we
were going into it,” said Joyce
Yasko, assistant director of
nursing .and patient care for
the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute,
which established the hotline.

Yasko also said the Cancer
Information and Referral Serv-
ice was popular even before it
gained the publicity it is cur-
rently receiving.

The CIRS is a toll-free num-
ber anyone can call to find out
more about early detection,
prevention and treatment of
cancen

The service is used by
cancer patients, their families
and the general public, as well
as by some health care profes-
sionals. According to Yasko,
”We receive a variety of
calls.”

A staff of oncology

specialists is available to an-
swer callers’ questions direct-
ly or to refer them to a
specialist. The staff may offer
to mail literature to callers and
always invites them to call
again.

Yasko said people who use
the CIRS are ”very grateful.
They have looked at this as a
very valuable resource.”

The American Cancer Soci-
ety has another service similar
to the PCI. The American
Cancer Society referral service,
which deals mostly with early J
detection and prevention of
the disease, is not in competi-
tion with the CIRS, however.

According to Yasko, ”We
refer callers to them, and they
refer callers to us. We have a
collaborative relationship.”

The nearest referral services
outside of Pittsburgh are locat-
ed in Philadelphia and Colum-
bus, Ohio.

Yasko said the CIRS is fund-
ed completely by the PCI, but
she feels it would be an ”ex-
cellent community resource
for a foundation in the com-

‘munity to fund.”

Jury selection to beginfor white supremacist trial 

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Jury
selection was scheduled for
Thursday in the trial of a Homer
City white supremacist accused
of distributing counterfeit money.

James P. Wickstrom, 45, and
co-defendant David Gardner, 44,
of Greensburg, are scheduled to
reappear for jury selection before
U.S. District Judge Glenn C.
Mencer.

A trial for the two men ended
in a mistrial last Thursday after an
agent for the U.S. Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms testified
that Wickstrom said he was a
member of the Aryan Nations, ”a
conservative, right-wing, para-
military organization.”

Mencer said the prosecution
and defense had agreed to refrain
from describing Wickstrom’s po-
litical and religious beliefs during
the trial. -

Two men dro wn
when boat capsizes

NEW KENSINCTON, Pa. (AP)
- Two workmen riding with four
others to their Allegheny River
dredging barge drowned Monday
when their 12-foot aluminum
skiff capsized in strong winds,
heavy rain and sleet.

The bodies of Paul Santoro, 27,

of Monessen, a crane operator, I
and James Forester, 31, of Kittan—
ning, a deck hand, were reco-
vered about two hours after their
boat capsized approximately 75
feet from the River Forest Yacht
Club in Allegheny Township,
Westmoreland County, authori-
ties said.

The men were employees of
the derrick boat division of C.C.
Marine Maintenance Co. of Ge-
orgetown, Beaver County.

DiFonso said the six workers
were heading from shore in Har-
rison Township to a river derrick
in ’’pitch black’’ about 6:40 a.m.
when a high wind caused a wave
to capsize the boat, which had a
five-horsepower motor. —

The survivors said neither dead
man was wearing a life jacket
when the boat capsized.

Corruption denied
by Auditor General

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ Auditor
General Don Bailey denied alle-
gations of job-selling and corrup-
tion in his office, while
Republican opponent Barbara
Hafer insisted during a video-
taped debate on Monday that the
agency needs ”a spring house-
cleaning, and I’m the woman to
do it. —

NEWS BRIEFS

”He not only maces, he con-
tinually asks people, demands of
people, to give him money for his
own political ambitions,” Hafer
said.

The candidates’ first televised
showdown, sponsored by the
League of Women Voters, was
taped at WQED-TV. The half-
hour debate was scheduled to be
broadcast on Tuesday and Wed-
nesday on Pennsylvania's public
television stations as a special
report of The People's Business.

”You know the facts,” she told
Bailey, ”and the facts are there is
job selling; there’s corruption in
your office. It is a legacy of in-
competence and corruption that
you are perpetuating.”

Bailey said her claims were
’’simply false.” The Democratic
candidate, 43, an attorney seek-
ing election to a second four-year
term, said his office has done _”a
remarkable job” since he suc-
ceeded Democrat Al Benedict in
1984.

Swift action by
police ends standoff

FRANKLIN, Pa. (AP) — A
police lieutenant used his thumb
to disarm a Mercer County man

who allegedly shot his ex-wife
and her boyfriend and then took
them to a hospital for treatment,
authorities said.

Colleen McDivitt, 30, and
Frederick S. Walter, 39, both of
Polk, Venango County, were
reported in critical condition in
the Franklin Regional Medical
Center, officials said.

State police said Harry E.
McDivitt Jr., 31, of Sandy Lake,
was held in the Venango County
Jail in lieu of $85,000 bond on
two counts of attempted homi-
cide and aggravated assault and
one count of committing a crime
with a firearm. A preliminary
hearing is scheduled for Nov. 1.
I McDivitt was arrested in the
hospital's emergency room early
Sunday morning after a one-hour
standoff with state and local
police, authorities said.

Police said Franklin Lt. Terry L.
Schultz and several backup
officers first tried to talk McDivitt
into surrendering and finally
decided to distract him.

’’I saw him cocking the gun,
and I made my move,” Schultz
said. ‘'1 was able to jam my
thumb between the hammer and
the firing pin. The cylinder
couldn't turn, and the gun
couldn't fire with my thumb in
there.” I

Trooper Herbert A. Bruggeman

Yet. today‘s Pill is as effective as
yesterdays. In fact. it‘s still the most
effective birth control available
other than sterilization.

But is the Pill right for you? You
should see your doctor to help you
answer that. If the answer is yes,
then the ultimate decision is yours.
And it‘s important that you learn all
you can about oral contraceptives.

First and foremost, what are the
risks? Does the Pill cause cancer?
Will it make you less fertile? Do you
need to take a rest from it? These are
just a few questions that have sur-
rounded the Pill since 1960. Ques-
tions which must be addressed by
you and your physician.

What about the Pill and breast
cancer? Although there are conflict-
ing reports concerning this issue,
the Centers for Disease Control
reported that women who took the
Pill. even for 15 years, ran no higher
risk of breast cancer than women
who didn’t. The CDC also reported
that ovarian and uterine cancer are
substantially less common among
women who use oral contraceptives.

The Pill has been shown to have
other health benefits as well. Pill
users are less likely to develop pelvic
inﬂammatory disease (tubal infec-
tions). benign breast disease and
iron deficiency anemia, not to men-
tion menstrual cramps.

But ifthe Pill is so effective at pre-
venting pregnancy. can it later pre-
vent you from having a baby when
you're ready to have one? Studies

But of all the major changes that
have taken place since the 60’s, one
is hardly visible at all: the change
that has taken place in the Pill.

In 1960, the Pill contained as
much as 150 megs. ofthe hormone

megs. or less. That‘s afraction ofthe

indicate that if you were fertile

before you took the Pill, taking it

will not affect your ability to have
children later. Some women may
experience a short period of read-
justment after discontinuing the
Pill. Even so, most women usually
become pregnant soon.

One piece of advice you may have
heard if you’re on the Pill is that you
should take an occasional rest from
it. Yet there's no medical basis for
this advice. Furthermore, a rest
could turn out to be anything but
restful, since switching to a less

effective form of birth control
increases your chances for un-
planned pregnancy.

Now that you know what the risks
aren’t. you should know what the
risks are. For example, if you are
taking the Pill, you should not
smoke. Especially if you are over 35.
Cigarette smoking is known to
increase the risk of serious and pos-
sibly life-threatening ad verse effects
on the heart and blood vessels from
Pill use. What’s more, women with
certain conditions or medical histo-
ries should not use the Pill.

Even ifyou’re already on the Pill,
you should see your doctor at least
once a year. And read the patient
information regularly.

Taking the Pill is easy. Deciding
whether or not to take it isn't. That’s
why it’s so important for you to
make an informed decision. Contin-
ue reading everything you can about
birth control methods. Seek out reli-
able sources. Talk to your doctor.

right direction. Just think, since you
began reading this, there’s a good
chance your knowledge level about
the Pill has increased. Considerably.

”For me, just being able to use
this opportunity to brush up on
my interpersonal skills so that I
can talk to authority [figures]
much better is worthwhile,” said
Ugochi lrondi, coordinator for
the fair.

”About four or five years ago,
I saw [the National Society for
Black Engineers] holding job fairs
for their students and saw a need
to extend this kind of service to
as much of the [campus] commu-
nity as possible,” said Raymond,
advisor for the Black Action
Society.

”And for those black students
that tend not to utilize college
placement services as much as
they could, this is a major way to
get them to do so.

”We started preparing as far
back as June,” said Raymond,
”by inviting companies to partic-
ipate and send representatives to
our fair. We also contacted other
[college and universitie] black or-
ganizations, asking them to join
us.” -

Placement has also contributed
to publicizing the fair by provid-
ing leads for companies interest-
ed in participating. ”Companies

call and ask us questions — is it
worth doing, how many students
do you think we'll get, how suc-
cessful is the fair — and we en-
courage their support,” said
Hopkins.

”We’ve had students from as
far away as Ohio,” said Ray-
mond. And this is probably be-
cause companies are ”pub—
licizing to other schools that
they're sending representatives to
our job fair.”

Various changes from previous
presentations have been initiated
to enhance this year's fair. First,

set costs of production,” said
Raymond.

According to Raymond, adver-
tising is the main cost and mail-
ing is a minor one.

”So far, it has cost close to
$5,000,” said Tarpeh.

A second improvement is that
areas that past participants in-
quired about were integrated into
this year's program.

For example, ”we’ve added
hea|th—related professions which
we didn't do last year,” said Ray-

mond. ”We don't have as many
health—re|ated professions as we'd
like, but it's a start.”

Finally, the BAS and NSBE
have placed special emphasis on
advertising the fair.

’’If an event is advertised too far
in advance, people don't recog-
nize the date and miss the
event,” said Raymond. ”Timely
publicizing is as important as, if
not more than, the abundance of
advertising.”

ing, she could in some way en-

courage future slanderous

The Philadelphia Police

Department does plan to monitor
the Klan’s behavior on Nov. 5 but
specifics on manpower and
deployment are not available.

Both Roundtree and Ceci ex- 1

pect a great deal ofshouting to
take place between the Klan and
their organization on Nov. 5, bUt
neither can say at this time what

the outcome of the event will be.
Neither looks forward to a violent
outcome, but both assured that
their group is more than willing
to defend itself.

”We have no well-defined
philosophy on social change.
There's probably a wide range of
feelings towards violence within
our organization,” said Ceci.

Celeste Myers, president of
Pitt's Black Action Society, ex-
pressed a great deal of interest in
the events to occur on Nov. 5 and
remarked that she feels it is very
important for youth to be in-
volved in opposing racism. She
added, however, that she would
never condone the use of vio-
lence to get a point across.

New Dukakis tactic
no better than Bush

Oh, how the tables havebeen turned.
In July, just after the Democratic Convention, Michael
Dukakis was riding a crest of favorable public opinion.

«George Bush, who had fallen far behind in the polls,

brought up the fact that Michael Dukakis had vetoed a
bill requiring teachers in Massachusetts to lead their stu-
dents in the Pledge of Allegiance. Bush used this incident
to imply that Dukakis was unpatriotic. '
I The attack, as unfounded as it was, managed to bring
the Dukakis campaign down in midswing. Just a couple
of months after Bush first brought up the issue of patri-
otism, he now has a commanding lead over Dukakis with
only two weeks remaining before the election.

Now the faltering Dukakis campaign has claimed that
the Bush campaign is ”racist..” Lloyd Bentsen, Jesse Jack-
son and Dukakis’ campaign manager, Susan Estrich, have
all made comments referring to the Bush ads about a black
convict on furlough in Massachusetts who raped a white
woman. Estrich said, ”There is no stronger metaphor for
racial hatred in our country than the black man raping the
white woman.” This is yet another example of the unfair
and unfounded claims being tossed about in this
campaign. ' . . I

It is a sad commentary when the campaign for the office
of president of the United States has to sink to such lev-
els. In an election devoid of debatable issues, it seems only .
logical that the two candidates would have no option but
to sully each other’s reputations in the hope that the ”less
dirty” of the two will win the Oval Office.

It may betoo late in the election for either candidate
to resort to actually trying to win by virtue of what his
platform is, but then, does anyone really know what the
candidates stand for?

Why is there

This Nov. 22 marks the. 25th

Anniversary of the JFK assassinav

tion. This means that the news-
weeklies will once again
”celebrate” theevent by splash-
ing their covers with portraits of
the man. Indeed, just last week
John Kennedy appeared on the
covers of both Time and US.
News and World Report. Why?

For some mysterious reason,
Kennedy and images of ”Came-
lot” fascinate the public more
than any other administration
has. Kennedy was in office for a
little over 1,000 days — just long
enough for him to ingratiate him-

‘ self with the American public.

Time after time, Kennedy's name
appears on the ”best U.S. presi-
dents" list. Again, why? Because
of his menu of accomplishments?
What accomplishments? The

hackneyed answer, of course, is ,

Kennedy's resolve on the Cuban
Missile Crisis that occurred in Oc-

tober, 1962. However, if Kenne-
dy had listened to his CIA
director, John McCone, who told
Kennedy in August that offensive
nuclear missiles were suspected
in Cuba, the conflict might not

have advanced as tar as it had.

Perhaps it was Kennedy's sup-
port of the civil rights movement
that endears him to the people.
Kennedy may have verbally sup-
ported the civil rights movement,
but what did he actually do? The
omnibus civil rights bill wasn't
passed until 1964, the new Vot-
ing Rights Act until 1965. Both of
these measures occurred under
the Great Society initiatives of the
Johnson administration. The first
black U.S. Supreme Court Justice,
Thurgood Marshall, said in his
report a year-and-a-half ago that

A group of us was having lunch
the other day when Beeman
came hurrying in. He was flushed
with what seemed like victory.

”I think I've got it,” he ex-
claimed.

»”What is that?”

”I just made ‘an appointment

with my daughter. I haven't been

able to see her for two months,
but she informed me that she
could fit me in at 6 o'clock on
Thursday.” ‘

”That’s neat,” I said. ”How did
you do it?” V

”It wasn't easy. I kept leaving
messages at her dorm saying that
I would be grateful to simply

meet with her and talk over how I

things were going.

”The first time she turned me
down was because she was go-
ing to Vermont to look at the
leaves. Thevsecond time she ac-
tually made a date with me, but
then canceled it, as she had been
invited to wash her boyfriend's
car. And three weeks ago, she
called to say that she couldn't see
me on her birthday because she
wanted to enter a 26-mile mara-
thon where you could meet a lot
of neat guys.”

”How can you be sure that she
will show up forthe appointment
she's made now?” I wanted to
know.

”She sounded as if she were

John Kennedy did little to ad-
vance the cause of the civil rights
movement. Only Ronald Reagan
has done less. Marshall gave
more, albeit faint, praise to LBJ for
the aforementioned acts.

Kennedy, much to the chagrin
of the liberals, was no dove. The
Special Forces, a.k.a., ”the Green
Berets,” a branch of the army that
specialized in guerrilla warfare,
was created under the Kennedy
administration. Was this to com-
pensate for the Peace Corps? The
United States also got its feet wet
in Vietnam under the Kennedy
administration. U.S. troops (”ad-
visers”) in Vietnam totaled over
15,000 by the end of 1963 —— aid
to South Vietnam during that
same year exceeded $500
million.

Why then the hoopla? — the
non—partisan brouhaha that oc-
curs every anniversary ofJFK’s in-

assumption into Heaven? Has

”You’re a lucky man, Bee-

THE PITI NEWS, .

‘Dorsett returns to Pittsburgh just in time

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

It was Homecoming at Pitt this ‘
past weekend, so Anthony Dor-
sett came home.

But it was not actually by his
own doing.

The Denver Broncos, who ‘ac-
quired Dorsett in an off—season
deal with the Dallas Cowboys,
were in town for Sunday's match-
up with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
The game just happened to fall
on Homecoming Weekend, and
so ”T.D.,” a native of nearby

Hopewell," Pa., took full advan-
tage of it.

”A couple of the defensive
backs [for the Broncos] and I went
to my mom's house for dinner
[on Saturday night]," said Dor-
sett. ”We all ate very well, need-
less to say.”

~ Due to a late flight in from
Denver, Dorsett was unable to at-
tend the Panthers’ game against
Navy. But that doesn't mean the
outcome was not on his mind.

”My roots are here. I love it
here. This is football country. I

Offense keeps moving
“higher as Dickerson

matures with season

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

The quarterback spot may be
the single most important posi-
tiongon a football team. He con-
trols the offense and is usually the
determining factor between win-

ning and losing. Without a good
quarterback, the " team falters.
With a good QB comes success
and championships.

At the beginning of the season,

Pitt quarterback Darnell Dicker-
son had a few disbelievers. Some

said he couldn't throw the ball.
Others said he wasftoo slow.

ther offense. ‘ A

He has proved those people.

' wrong.

Two weeks ago, against the

Temple Owls, Dickerson threw

for 287 yards, completing 15 of

21 passes. He also ran for a

45-yard touchdown during that

game, the longest of his career.

Last "week against Navy, Dicker-
son threw for 135 yards in a game

where the pass wasn't needed.
For the season, Dickerson has

completed 64 of 125 attempts for
1,138 yards and seven touch-

downs. Before the Navy game,

he was ranked eighth in the na-
tion in passing efficiency and the
highest rated sophomore in‘th‘e

NCAA.‘
”Each week we set goals, and

‘so far we have met most of those
goals," Dickerson said. ”Right

now, I feel, the team is moving
right up the ladder. We can go all
the way up to the top.”

Even more said he wouldn't be
able to run the complicated Pan-

’ Dickerson is the type of player
who can do a lot for an offense.
He has the ability to run the ball
just as well as he can throw it. He
can elude oncoming rushers with
ease, [and has taken pressure off
an injured offensive line. .

When Tom Ricketts and Ro-
man Matusz went down, the Pan-
thers were forced to play
freshmen Scott Miller and Dave
Dixon. Not the best of times, but
Dickerson can help that;

”You always give your best, no
matter who is playing quarter-
back,” center Dean Caliguire
said’. ”Yet, when you see a kid
working that hard, it pumps you

, up a little bit and gives you a lit-

tle more incentive.”

Not that the Pitt offense needs l

more incentive. They have
scored 256 points through seven
games so far this season, compare
this to last season when they
scored 230 points through all 12
games. The school record stands
at 604 by the '71 Panthers. _
”At the beginning of the sea-
son, I thought the offense was go-
ing to have to carry us while our
defense got the experience,” Pitt

coach Mike Gottfried said. ’’I

think Darnell makes [the offense
dangerous]. He is such a, threat.
I think to stop our ballclub right
now, you have to stop Darnell.”

An, offshoot of this is that the
rest of the offense has also come
alive. Freshman running back

and 202 yards against Boston

when I do, I love it.

”I still follow Pitt’s football
team’. ’Go Pitt!’ by the way. Mat-
ter of fact, I was at the University
of Pittsburgh yesterday with some
of the guys,” Dorsett said.
”Coach Gottfried is doing a nice
job with the team [here].

’’I was surprised when I saw
the score [52—6, Pitt]. Not sur-
prised that they beat them, but
that they beat them that bad.
Navy has a history of giving Pitt
a hard time. They did when I was
here.” ”

 

 

Tuesday, October 25, I988

Dorsett played at the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh from 1973 to
1976 and currently owns school
records for career and single-
season rushing yardage (6,526
and 2,150, respectively) and
career scoring (380 points), along
with a host of others.

But as a professional, Dorsett
and his teams historically have
some of their worst outings
against Pittsburgh, and Sunday
was no exception.

The downtrodden Steelers.

whipped the two-time defending
AFC champion Broncos, 39-21,

holding Dorsett to a measly 24
yards on 12 carries. ,

’’It’s tough always having bad
days against Pittsburgh,” Dorsett
griped. ”I wanted to leave the
fans of Pittsburgh something to
remember me by. They out-
played us inevery aspect of the
game. You like to perform well,
but we stunk.”

Dorsett owns only one Super.

Panther defense forced to rely on more youth

. By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

When two of the anchors of the
University of Pittsburgh's staunch
defensive line —— preseason All-
American candidates Marc Spin-
dler and Burt Grossman —— fell
victim to injury early in the sea-
son, head coach Mike Gottfried
and his defensive coordinator,
John Fox, were obviously placed
in an extremely precarious po-
sition.

A quick glance at the depth
chart revealed that the reserve
defensive line was dominated by
first-year players, many of whom
were ”natural” freshmen in that
they had not yet been redshirted.

If the Panther defense was to be
able to complement their high-
powered offensive counterparts,
the play of Jeff Esters, Gary
Gorajewski, Mike Chalenski and
Ken Radinick was certainly going
to be the key.

According to Fox, those four
have passed the test with flying
colors, especially when taking
their performance against Navy
on Saturday into account.

”The defensive line positions
have been like a spinning door,”
Fox said after the 52-6 Pitt win.

”We felt really good about the
performance ofleff Esters. He's a
young guy who has come on
quickly.

”Goraiewski, Chalenski and

Radinick are other guys who are

playing well for us. It has really
been a struggle for these guys be-
cause they've had to learn their
positions quickly, but they've all
done well.”

Since Grossman is back at his
position and Spindler is out for
the remainder of the season, the
chip will continue to be placed
squarely on the shoulders of the
frosh players for the rest of '88.

”I look at'it as a challenge,
knowing where I was and where
I have to be to perform at this lev-
el," the 6-foot—5, 240-pound
Chalenski said of his playing
time. ”I would have probably
played in spots this year [if not for
the injuries], anyhow, but this is

i

an opportunity for me now.

’’I’m starting to learn a lot now.
The biggest thing is getting my as-
signments down, and [defensive
line] coach [Frank] D’Alonzo has
helped a lot and has done a good
job."

Esters is another player who
feels he has significantly im-
proved since he was first thrown
into action against Notre Dame
three weeks ago.

”Until now, I was fairly incon-
sistent because I wasn't adjusted
to the tempo," said Esters, a 6-3,
265-pound tackle, also known as

”Top Dog.”
”The tempo in high school was
a lot different — I was big and

overpowering. Now, I have to

learn some technique and things
like that,” Esters added.
Obviously, Esters and his peers
have done a great deal of learn-
ing in a short period of time.
Along with Grossman, Richard
Allen and Tom Sims, the four
combined to stop the Navy at-
tack, holding the Midshipmen to
a miniscule 33 yards on 52 at-
tempts and pressuring Navy quar-
terback Gary Mclntosh all day
when they weren't slamming him
on the drenched Pitt Stadium turf
seven times. Esters and Chalenski
led the way for the frosh class
with four tackles apiece. Chalen-
ski also tacked on a sack, while
Esters assisted on~a takedown on

receivers with 414 yards on 22
receptions. Altogether, they have
gained 3,149 yards in total
offense this season. Not too bad
considering the team is 4-3.
”We know we have a good
offense,” Richards said. ”All we
have to do is execute the plays to
perfection like we do in practice.

Then we'll put 35 or 40 points on C’...

the board every week.”
We are taking one

game at a time and try-
ing to win them all.

— Reggie Williams
ll

Reggie Williams was injured
early in the season and hasn't
been the most active Panther
receiver this season (eight
catches, 146 yards), but he came
back in a big way against Navy
last Saturday. Starting in place of
the injured Billy Osborn (twisted
ankle), Williams caught two pass-
es for 94 yards. Both times he
came very close to scoring
touchdowns.

”We are prepared for every
week,” Williams said. ”Every
team has to be like Notre Dame
and Penn State for us. We are tak-
ing one game at a time and try-
ing to win them all.

”The offense is working really
well right now, and Darnell is do-
ing a good job.”

It all goes back to Dickerson.
After every game so far this sea-
son, opposing coaches have

raved about his play and say he
is just getting better all the time.

His teammates agree.

”Darnell was a great quarter-
back to begin with,” Caliguire
said. ”Now he is starting to get
the system down more. He's just
[now] coming into his own.”

With each passing game, Dick-
erson is getting stronger, and he
is only a sophomore. He still has

enough, the Denver Broncos in
Super Bowl XII.

But he would be sporting two
championship rings, had the
Steelers not toppled Dallas in the
following season’s Super Bowl,
35-31.

In Dorsett’s previous four regu-
lar season contests against Pitts-
burgh, he averaged only 72.3
yards per game on the ground,
while scoring just two touch-
downs. Sunday’s effort was by far
his worst output against the team.

’’I’m in excellent shape,” said
Dorsett. ”| feel great.  I always
seem to have a tough time against
the Steelers. I know I'm on the
last leg of my career. I really did
think beforehand that this could
be my last time playing in

0-Pittsburgh.

”It is surprising to me that I've
been able to play 12 years. Every
year the players are getting bet-
ter and better. They're almost like
freaks to be as big and strong and
fast as they are.”

Dorsett’s latest effort did make
him only the second player in the
history of the NFL to‘ gain over
16,000 combined yards in receiv-

ing and rushing. He recently
moved into second place for
career rushing yardage, only be-
hind the great Walter Payton.

”I’m not a statistic freak,”
claimed Dorsett. ”When my
playing days are over, then I’ll
look back and cherish it more.
Right now, I don't pay much at-
tention to it.

”A guy that gave you your
money's worth, that's how I want
to be remembered.”

Mclntosh. Radinick (6-5, 210
pounds) and Gorajewski (6-4,
230 pounds) also saw action and
played well, combining for three
tackles and one sack.

What is even a bigger credit to
the young players is the fact that
all four were slated to be redshirt-
ed if at all possible. They all ex-
pected to be in Pittsburgh for an
extra year, but those thoughts
evaporated quickly as Spindler's
body hit the ground in agony due
to a torn ligament in his knee.

’’I know that extra year could
only have helped me,” said Es-
ters, who runs a 4.8 second
40-yard dash and benches 460
pounds. ”Being a defensive line-
man, you really want to save that
year because you never know
when you'll be iniured.

”But I think I've adjusted well
to playing this season. Experience
will help me a lot. You can't real-
ly say I'm a veteran right now, but
you could say I'm seasoned a lit-
tle bit. My biggest concern right
now is getting myself prepared
for these lastfour games [Rutgers,
Penn State, North Carolina State,
and Syracuse] because those will
determine whether or not we get
a bowl bid.”

”We’re just getting some peo-
ple on the field [for whom] the fu-
ture [seems] very bright,”
Gottfried said. ’’I was concerned
about whether [or not] our young

guys could hold them out, but.

they did.”

Gottfried shouldn't be half as
concerned as Rutgers’ offensive
linemen will be a week from
Saturday. I

Soccer team’s problems continue.
to mount in disappointing season

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

After beginning their season
with four wins against fourloss-
es, the Pitt soccer team has been
hard pressed to come up with a
victory.

Why? Look no further than the
box scores. Pitt has produced
only one goal during its four-
game winless stretch, that com-
ing in a 1-1 tie with Carnegie
Mellon.

The problem reached new
proportions last week when Pitt
lost to Robert Morris, 2-0, on
Wednesday, and 1-0 to George-
town on Saturday.

The Panthers are 0-3-1 in their
last four games and are making a
run toward equaling last season's
abysmal 5-I0-1 overall record.

Coach Joe Luxbacher is past
the point of frustration. He has
tried numerous player combina-
tions in the midfield, switched
goalkeepers and has started many
inexperienced freshmen to try to
produce a winning team, or at
least one that scores goals.

”We’re looking for leaders;
anybody who stands out and
takes charge, they're going to
play,” Luxbacher said. ”Right
now we don't have anybody do-
ing that. Nobody, with the excep-
tion of a few [people], is really
showing us that he deserves to be
the only guy out there in that po-
sition.

’’It still comes down to doing
the basics in order to win. We're
just putting different guys here
and there, hoping something will
click. That’s not how you do it.
You want to have a solid group
doing the job. I don't like having
different line-ups every game,”
Luxbacher added.

A major factor in Luxbacher’s
disappointment is the below-par
play of his veterans.

’’I’m not satisfied at all, no way.
In the beginning of the season, I
thought we were solid in certain
areas that we're not getting
production from. We've played
Austin Grace, Mike Laus, Brian
Pellegrino [all freshmen], a lot.
You wouldn't think we would
have to do that. There are guys

who have played two or three
years who should be improving
and are not.

”As a result, we have to experi-
ment. And when you experiment
midway through the season, it's”
a sign that you have trouble."

The season has been character-
ized by one major flaw: missed
scoring opportunities. Pitt has
had countless breakaways, shots
inside the 18 and flubbed assist
passes. Every game, the potential
for scoring is there. The ball just
does not wind up in the oppo-
nent’s net. i

Luxbacher is tired of giving his
team credit for the one that got
away.

The starting goalkeeper for Pitt _

changes as often as one can I
change his mind. Mark Hen-
dricks, Jay Kapusta and Tim
Sobelman all have an equal
chance of appearing in the net at
the start of every game. The in-
consistency in the starting spot
bothers a few members of the
team. I
Assistant coach Bob Campbell,
who is in charge of making the
goalkeeping decisions, has a

slight problem because he views 5

all three keepers as excellent.
”All three guys are tough,
there's no doubt about that. I
think that when a person doesn't
start, they should look at their
game more closely and see how
they can improve,” Campbell

said.

Thus, the 1988 Panther squad
has been marked by experimen-

tation in all positions. Very few

players have shown consistent
excellence throughout the sea-
son. As aresult, the team has
been struggling.

Pitt is 0-4 in the Big East with
one conference game remaining

against Villanova. Pitt takes on ,
Niagara tomorrow night at 7:15 

pm. in the stadium.

,Wyoming hopes Top 10 visit isn't a short one

By Kurt I. Repanshek

Associated Press Writer

CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Wyom-
ing's meteoric rise in The As-
sociated Press college football
poll is a tribute to the turnaround
that has the Cowboys riding the
nation's longest regular-season
winning streak.

A .500 team two years ago,
Wyoming cracked the Top 10 on
Monday for the first time in 21
years, following Saturday's 61-18
rout of Utah. UCLA, Notre Dame
and Southern California held on
to the top three spots.

”We’re certainly happy about
it,” Wyoming coach Paul Roach
said. ”lt’s good for our state, our
program, the university. And it's
good for the WAC [Western Ath-
letic Conference] to receive some

. recognition.

”However, for our players and
our coaches, it's a peripheral
thing. We still focus in on our No.
1 goal, and that's to defend our
[WAC] championship.”

Wyoming is 8-0 overall, 5-0 in
conference play and has won its

last 17 regular-season games.

The No. 10 ranking marked
Wyoming's fifth consecutive
week in the poll and was the
highest since the Cowboys were
No. 6 in the final 1967 listings
with a 10-0 record.

”We don't use it as incentive/’,

Roach said of the rankings. ’’I’m
sure that pleases our players to
receive that recognition. But
we're not defending a ranking.
We're defending a champion-
ship, and therein lies the
difference.”

Roach couldn't single out any-
thing that has transformed the
Cowboys from a 6-6 team in
1986 to an undefeated power-
house, other than to point to his
players’ and coaches’ dedication
and ambition.

”We just happen to have
enough of the right things and the

right chemistry, at least up to this
point,” he said. ’’All those things
[rankings, winning streaks] at
some point in time come to an
end. Cinderella takes her wand
and goes home.”

UCLA, which became No. 1
last week after Miami lost to
Notre Dame, defeated Arizona
24-3 Saturday and received 35 of
60 first-place votes and 1,171 of
a possible 1,200 points from a na-
tionwide panel of sports writers
and sportscasters.

Notre Dame, a 41-13 winner
over Air Force, was second for
the second week in a row, with
19 first-place votes and 1,144
points. UCLA and Notre Dame
are 7-0-0.

Southern Cal, 6-0-0, was idle
over the weekend. The Trojans
received five first-place votes and
1,086 points. UCLA plays
