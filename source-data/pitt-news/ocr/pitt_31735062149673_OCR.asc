Former Filipino Instructress

By Georgia Shuset and Edith
Rosenblatt
“Nyah, nyah, nyah,” is probably
what some little Filipinos would say
if they sould see Natalia Abuton
now.
Their former teacher is on the
receiving end of the instructions.
Natalia, a freshman in pre—edu-
cation at the University, taught Eng-
lish in the public school of her na-
tive town, Oroquieta, Philippine is-
lands. The manner of the petite,
black-haired student contrasts strik-
ingly with the hurried, see-you-in-
ﬁve—minutcs attitude of the average
Pitt student.
She has been in the United States
a little over four months, and has
not found it diff‘1~cult to adjust her-
self to the customs. However, she
is an individualist—refusing to eat
bread. “It was never served at my
home in the Philippines, and I can’t
get used to it,” she said. “I eat rice
instead.”
_ Illilstrating her point that the
Philippines are becoming more and
more “occidentalized,” she explain-
ed that in this land of 17 dialects,

‘Enters as First Year Student

English is the language taught in
the schools. Students, boys an.d
girls together, attend three schools
before going to colle-ge——-four years
of primary school, three years of
elementary school, and four of high
school. Natalia was graduated from
high school in 1932.

The Filipinos dress in the style
of the Western world. However, she
has brought with her a few rem-
nants of the old culture, including
Oriental jewelry, and an old-fash-
ioned native costume. She has pre-
sented a snapshot of herself in this
outﬁt to her senior mentor, Gene
Pyle, C41.

Natalia stated that swimming was
her favorite pastime in Oroquieta.
She is also interested in music, and
studied the piano for some time.

The gentle-mannered, eager—to-
please, l.ittle scholar is doubtful as
to whether the Philippines will
achieve their independence in 1946,
because of present world conditions.

She does not intend to return to
her homeland until she has com-
pleted her four—year course at the
Universitty.

The cyclotron, which will be

c- erected on . the campus, probably
- behind the Old. Mellon institute and

Thaw hall, will be the special ward
of the School of Medicine and the
department of physics. It will also
be available for research by any
industrial organization in the Pitts-
burgh area.

them having been built in this very
country already and several others
abroad. They are well-proven
Their great
value is being felt already in such
diverse ﬁelds as biology, chemistry,
geology, medicine, metalurgy, and
physics. The use of the artiﬁcial
radioactive materials made in cyclo-
trons is a new scientiﬁc method
which promises to equal in impor-
tanoe the invention of the balance
on the microscope.

Urgently Needed

The need of a cyclotron on the
campus is so urgent that much of
the research now being done in the
University cannot be ﬁnished until
the radioactive materials from this
cyclotron are available. Important
discoveries are being made in the
ﬁeld of medicine. Typical of these
are: The role of phosphorus in body
metabolism, metabolism of nerves,
muscles, or cells, and the action of
drugs.

Used For Cancer

Research is in progress on cancer,
vitamins, and animal nutrition in
the School of Medicine; fertilization
of egg cells, in the biology depart-
ment; diffusion of metals and the
scattering of atomic particles in the
physics of metals; and other im-
portant subjects in biophysics. Cy-
clotrons are also being used in the
treatment of cancer and leukemia.

The present cyclotrons are kept
busy" twenty hours a day to meet
the demands of their own institu-
tions so that practically no mate-
rial is available to anyone not affil-
iated with those institutions.

The Pitt cyclotron, which will be
built by Dr. Allen, will be of great
value to the.School of Medicine and
the physics department.

Klimcliek Hails
Yellin’s Work

As Craftsman

Just after. he put theﬁnishing
touches on over 10 years of work _on
the Cathedral wrought-iron, the
“blacksmith,” as he liked. to call
himself, put his tools away and died
peacefully. ‘ _ _

Samuel Yelli_n, America’s greatest
wrought-iron designer, died late last
week of a heart attack in his New
York home at 200' West 57th street.
Yellin had just completed his con-
tract with the University with the
setting up of the Commons Room
gate this summer. , ,

Albert Klimchek, University
architect, commented, “He was the
outstanding metal ‘craftsman in
America of any day and age. He
was the greatest craftsman who ever
lived in America.”

Yellin had received medals from
the American Institute of Archi-
tects, the Boston Architectural

' league, and the Pennsylvania Mu-

seum and School of Industrial Art.
He also received the Bok civic
award for being the outstanding
citizen of Philadelphia in 1925._
All the wrought-iron at the Uni-
versity was made by Yellin. He is
famous for his work on the Memor-
ial chapel at Valley Forge, the
gates at Harkness Memorial quad-
rangle at Yale, the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine, and the Federal
Reserve building in New York."

This is what Dr.
W. Jacobsen, dean of the

hally-esterday morning as the
twelfth annual Western Pennsyl-

for a thre-e-day meeting. .

Several hundred teachers and ad

other speakers yesterday. Eight to
ten thousand teachers, administra-
tors, and pro: essors are expected
to attend the various meetings
throughout the Oakland district to-
day and tomorrow.

In speaking on “The Home and
the Public School,” Dr. Jacobsen
told the teachers: “Many agencies
are participating in the education
of the child of today. .This has re-
sulted in chaos and confusion. There
has been a tendency for the home
to lose some of its responsibilities
and for other agencies to increase
their activities.

“In addition to its, speciﬁc re-
sponsibilities of giving» our youth
certain deﬁnite training,” Dr. J acob-.

ityof acting as a coordinator of all

Dr. Watson Advises All Women at University
To Prc pare Now for War Industry Positions

By Alice Lewis
University women should begin

now to prepare for a war—time emer-

gency when they are called upon
to take over industrial positions for-
merly held by men, stated Dr. J.
P. VVatson, acting director of the
University Bureau of Business Re-
search and professor of economics,
in a recent address before members
of WSGA career—clinic.

Commenting that most women
aren’t even aware of the problem
that faces them, Dr. Watson said he
hoped to collaborate with the clinic
in its campaign of the year: “to
make University women conscious
of their work in the national de-
fen:-:e program.”

According to Dorothy Ornitz, E41,
c-hairman, this is the first attempt
of its kind to be made on any camp-
us, and she invitesall women to at-
tend the series of 40 conferences.
the ﬁrst to be held Tuesday, from
3:30 to 4:30 o’clock in 132 Cathe-

dial.

Purpose of the preliminary talk
before the clinic, stated Dr. Watson,
was to obtain a cross—section of stu-
dent opinion and to discuss ques-
tions submitted to him. In answer
to the question, “What kind of work
will college-educated women be
able to do?” he said, that since they
are the logical ones to replace spec-
ially-trained men, their greatest op-
portunity lay in specialized ﬁelds of
technical employment, such as lore-
women, supervisors, inspectors, and
personnel administrators in large
industrial plants.

Dr. Watson added that this will
necessarily require a great amount
of reaoljustmcnt, because many wo-
men will be entering ﬁelds from
which they were previously barred,
and students will be discontinuing
theircourscs in home economics and
education in favor of science, phys-
ics, and chemistry.

Another aspect, not to be over-

looked is the great demand for skill-
ed labor that will arise. Then, here,
as in England, there may be woman
mechanics, bus—drivers, and tool-
makers, prophesied Dr. Watson. .

What will happen to women who
have taken over men’s positions-
when men return was another prob-
lem he considered vital. “Whether or‘
not a woman can hang on to her-job:
depends upon the woman herself.
and the job she selects,” he said.

If she shows that she iseas good’.
as, or better than a man, she will
probably be kept. If, however, _the;
women are forced to give their posi-
tions back to men,,they will have
to undergo a period of retrain'ih’g..

“The problem is still too _,ne.w,”
continued Dr. Watson, “-to obtain any
real statistics on it." He announced
that most of his assumptions .were

v “as-ed on figures fro_m the World

War and from the literature_oI,1_ la-
bor rehrltions which was applicable.

I’ve been watching these freshman Roticy men
clomping around out on the ﬁeld lately, and it kind
of makes me feel like a veteran: a veteran after the
six weeks we spent at Fort Monroe this last summer.

When I was a junior I was scared about camp,
They said you had to stand stiff at attention for so
long that you’d ﬂop over on your face. They said

I ' ‘ your ear drums would burst and
bleed on account of those big
guns. They said the chiggers
would chig you, and the drilling
would drop you. They said
Virginia was stinking and the
sun would sizzle you.

Well, we did march

and we did drill. Everyday
and everyday and sometimes
twice a day. Hut, two hut, two
We lugged those big old

riﬂes around all the time. They
madeus play nursemaid to those
old riﬂes: we scoured ’em, and
shot ’em; we polished ’em and
primped ’em. Hut, two, hut,
two We did everything
but sleep with ’em. And it was
hot lugging a riﬂe in that Vir-A
ginia sun—-damn hot! Hut, two,
hut, two The sun made
thick grease ooze out around
the riﬂe stock and soak up on
your shirt. And little puffs of
dust would squish out under
those army clodhoppers. We
stood at attention in that blister,
and blobs of sweat dribbled
down our back bones. Once I
darted my hand up to knock the
water bead that hung on the
end of my nose. I marched 10
minutes extra for that: a man
at attention doesn’t twitch a bit.
We tramped out to the guns sometimes and drilled
and drilled and drilled. We used dummy shells on the
anti-aircraft guns--just for the practice—and worked
up a nice easy pace of “fuze, cut, ram, wham!”———nice
easy about 20 times a minute. There were three crews
sometimes and we used to race each other, “fuze, cut,
ram Wham!” “Meet the all-

 
 
 

. shun!!!

to say. And when we ﬁred
the real stuff aimed at a tiny
tube towed by an airplane,
those ram-—WI-IAMS nearly
blasted you off the platform.
‘The fellows said it wasn’t the
noise, it was the concussion.

There were big

12-inch guns that roared and
belched out 1000-pound bul-
lets at something like $2000 a .
throw—2000 bucks——that ain’t

12-inch babies really set you
on your ear, and people all
the reservation were

sciemuic equipment

dows ‘open the day the big ones went off.
And they kept loading us! up with more and more

inside of a gas mask? and ‘marched us through tear
gas and a smoke screen. Wesniﬂed bare-nosed at the
poison stuff and learned to get ’em on in two counts:
GAS: hut, two. They gave us those packs, too. And
we grunted and groaned. The U. S. Army pack_equip—

‘ment “is probably the most scientiﬁcally designed of
any in thelworld,” the manual says, and when you

haveithe pack slung on you just right you‘-hardly know
you're carrying it—it’s that scientiﬁc! Uh-huh! My
old tail was always draggin’. '

It all goes back a decade or so.
We were just entering our teens,

I

A and i‘ul.l of wise thoughts. One dark

and moonlcss night while we Sat
up late, reziding our inediaeval man-
uscripts by the light of a candle
held between the grinning teeth of
a skull, we got the bright idea that
if we could master the art of black
magic we would be Sure to get on
in the world. There ensued some
fearsome thoughts of the conse-
quences, namely the possession of
our soul by the devil, but since we
had been damned and consigned to
Hades by persons innumerable al-
ready, we decided repentance, if
any, could not but come too late.

Anyhow, we straightway betook
ourselves to the studies of magic, as
one olde philosopher called it. Dis-
dainiul of mere sleight-of—hand we
dug into books on Chaldean magic,
-‘ancient Egyptian and Sanskrit man-
uscripts.

 

over everything from the Mahab-
harata and the Ramayana to the
Egyptian Book of the Dead, con-
vinced us that we were a whiz of a
wizard, and we began looking about
for a soul to secure in -thrall.

We had a youngerybrother who

.. was our favorite laboratory animal,

and Sin-ce he had earned our imper-
ial disfavor at the time, over a
small matter of tattling on the cause
of certain disappearances of cigars
around the house, we determined to
' irn him into a creature condemned
to haunt diiunkards for forever-and-
a-day, taking the form of a green
dragon by night and the appear-
ance of a scarlet zombie with orange
borders by day.

9 While I Pondcred . . .

Accordingly, following up on this
beneﬁcent design, we made sundry
purcliases of incense, brz-izi_ei'S, e‘tc._,
drawing up a list of grievances
against our victim and stating fully
and clearly just what we wanted
done to him, since the genii who
benignly presided over this spell
demanded a bill of particulars to
produce.

The dark of the moon came and
we lay awake till midnight, when
we arose and Stealthily repaired to
a guest room where our apparatus
was hidden under a bed. We set it
up, lit the incense, and were just
preparing to burn the deposition in
the sacred ﬁre that would carry it
in the form of smoke to the demon
who granted Such requests, when
Fate in the form of a mother awak-
ened by incense fumes swarmed
down on us and snatched up said
deposition. Followed readings, mut-

nasty boy,” etc., and, luckless Sorc-er-
er that we were, we found ourselves
stretched over a parental knee.
0 . . . Of Forgotten Lore

Hastily we muttered a charm
which would encase us in a suit of
armor and make us invulnerable.
Alas, our charm did not work. I
hope I may be turned blue by a bad
fairy if I did not turn black and
blue shortly thereafter. Thus end-
ed my public career as a necrom-
ancer.

We did not retire completely on

this ignominious note, however
Thaurnaturgy was out at home,
but we used it among our

contemporaries to inspire fear and
respect. One day while visiting a
friend we spotted a large and lusci-
ous piece of candy reposing on a
table. Our sweet tooth is world-
famed, and with Machiavellian cun-
ning we proposed a bout. of magic,
in which we promised the party of
the second part to make that piece
Oi candy disappear beyond the ken
of mortal man.

Our friend consenting, we took
up that toothsome confection, slip-
ped it down the back of our shirt,
and then proceeded in incant cer-
tain spells, hoary with age, which
had orginated four thousand years
before in Ur of the Chaldees and
in Ancient Egypt. VVell, we showed
our empty hands to our friend, re-
membered an important engage-
ment and left. Outside we slipped
our hand into our shirt, mouth
watering, and paused a moment in
shocked surprise. The candy was
not there. We have been looking
for it ever since.

John Wishart Hoeveler has done
went and did it——he is now a Phi
Alpha Delta After crashing
the news for four long years in every
situation from political aggressor
to great lover, Hoeveler has ﬁnally
hit the obituary column with his
last mistake . . For the beneﬁt
of you freshmen who might wonder
how this group rushed past you, this
week, the Phi Alpha Delts are Strict-

Kitty Lou Haughton is telling a
smashing story of one car versus an-
other . She was driving, she
missed the crossing and lost the
race to the tune of crinkling fend-

$45. She could just see the dough
leaving her bank book!

Jim Jacobs is just as happy as
he would be in his right mind . . .
Pink Snow has settled round Jim's

the thaw.

Intra-squad Tilt

Pitt’s freshmen football prospects
get a chance to show how well
they’ve learned the Pitt system to-
day when coach Nick Kliskey runs
his charges through the ﬁrst of a
proposed series of intra-squad
games- .

After weeks of drilling in block-
ing and tackling, and practice in a
few“basic plays, the Panther cubs
have progressed to the point where

gthe coaching staff is anxious to see

how the boys look in a real game.
The freshmen have scrimmaged in
a few plays against skeleton defense
set-ups, a six-man line ‘and —no‘back-
ﬁeld, but today’s clash will give
them their first chance at real offen-
sive scrimmage against ,a full team.

and Klemcyak, the latter a 157-
pound scooter from Har-Brack, are
providing plenty of competition.

Several outstanding ends have
come up to ﬂank the strong fresh-
man lines. Olszewski, described by
Pitt coaches as “one of the best
punters ever t'o"A'com‘e up‘ to‘ the
practice ﬁeld, ” is a step ahead of

Coach Kliskey’s worries on. line

WAA Jottings

Announcing a complete program
of women’s sports for the coming
year, Adele Yorio, Ed41, president
of Women’s Athletic Association,
revealed today that both the Ca-
thedral lawn and the Cathedral
gymnasium will be utilized in “a
super-special, action-packed activi-
ties schedule for Pitt Amazons.”

As a new and special feature on
the schedule, WAA is introducing
“Bowling on the Green,” to be held
on the Cathedral lawn. Special in-
struction will be given to all girls
who are interested in participating
in this activity.

A great variety of sports is being
offered to members, including bowl-
ing on the green, tennis, archery,
modern dancing, badminton, volley-
ball, and ping pong. In each of these
activities, there will be instructors
present who will help girls who
are unfamiliar with the activity.

A new member of the physical
education faculty, Miss Elizabeth
Myer, will instruct the girls in all
the activities on the schedule. Miss
Riland, instructor of the modern
dance, will have charge of the danc-
ing classes.

The game of the day! It’s for the

ity the public schools must attempt
to build the prestige and responsi-
bility of the home. The public
schools can do this by: 1) having all
the members of the teaching staff
recognize the importance of the
home; 2) establishing a program of
reciprocal relations with the home;
3) giving instruction for family life
in the school; 4) establishing coun-
seling service ior the parents
through classes or through visiting
teachers or through conferences; and
5) making it possible for yotuigsters
to receive systematic religious in-
struction outside of the public
schools.

Better Homes

“The public schools of the day are
interested in building better homes
for a better America,” Dr. Jacobsen
concluded. Before coming to the
University as dean "of the School
of Education this September, Dr.

schools in Oakland, Calif.

The conference today will be
made up of two general meetings in
Syria Mosque and Memorial hall,

Tomlinson pioneered the newest wonder of
modern air travel— the Stratoliner. In rain,
snow, hail, and sleet, this veteran ﬂyer “asked
for trouble” to prove that high-altitude planes
can ﬂy over most bad weather.

Skill, vision, perseverance...“Tommy”
Tomlinson has them all—-in extra measure.
Mildness, coolness, ﬂavor—the qualities of a
fine cigarette—he gets them all in his smoking,
with an extra measure of each. He smokes

Extra Mildness

O Twenty years —— 7,000 hours of ﬂying — more hours
above 30,000 feet than any other ﬂyer. 19 national rec-
ords for speed and endurance. That’s the ﬂying log of
“Tommy” Tomlinson (above). His smoking log would
read: "I wanted more mildness in my cigarette. I
changed to Camels and got what I wanted—extra mild-
ness with a grand ﬂavor.”

Slower-burning Camels give you the natural mild-
ness and coolness of costlier tobaccos plus the freedom
from excess heat and irritating qualities of too-fast
burning. Try Camels. Get the extras-including extra

smokin g (see rig/at).
