Police scanner recordings from Friday
night indicate a scene of confusion
and confrontationinwhich Pitt police
resisted other ofﬁcers’ attempts to
enter Towers Lobby.

‘ “Stand back. That’s not happening

a Pit police ofﬁcer said over the ra-
dio.

discuss their arrests.

Delaney said DistrictAttomey Ste-

Earlier inthe night, Pitt police and

whether to enter University property,

“Pitt doesn’t want us to make en-

persisted.

“They’re trespassers, we need to
sort out that ASAP,” one non-Univer-

They even agreed that they
thought the protester was going to
pull the ﬁre alarm in Towers, caus-
ing thousands of people to evacuate
the buildings and head toward the
streets.

police official came to the dorms.
Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney de-
clined to give the name of the “high-
ranking” officer who resolved the
situation because the city is still in-
vestigating police actions.

But he did say, “I admire the guys i

for standing up —- the Pitt ofﬁcer. I

City Council full of thanks

Oﬁicials answer few questions about Oakland demonstrations

Lindsay Carroll
‘Assistant News Editor

City Council thanked public officials
and police officers yesterday, devot-
ing little time to discussingthe use of
police force in Oakland Thursday and
Friday during the G-20 Summit.

Councilmanjim Motznik thanked
public safety oflicers for their “tre-
mendous success.”

“Those people who don’t under-
stand what it means when a police of-

cludes Bloomﬁeld and Lawrenceville,
said he was in Lawrenceville when
people protested in Arsenal Park.

“We can learn and improve,”
Dowd said, “but I want to point out
that the police did a ﬁne job — a re-
ally ﬁne job — at least in the parts
that I saw.”

During the meeting, Council
President Doug Shields thanked
Gov. Ed Rendell for sending 1,200
state troopers to Pittsburgh during
the Summit.

“There are some problems we’re

don’t know what is going to happen,”
Shields said. '

Before the meeting, two people
publicly commented on the events
in Oakland.

One man in attendance said the
city created “a police state.” He re-
ferred to the Long Range Acoustic.
Device, a device police used to emit
messages and high—pitched sounds
inoakland. _‘ '-

Over the weekend, District 8
Councilman Bill Peduto ——- who was
at an out-of-state conference during
the council’s meeting — told The
Pitt News that City Council would
address the question of police con-
duct in Oakland as part of an overall
analysis of G-20 planning.

“I assure you that the incidents
that occurred both Thursday and
Friday will be part of that commit-
tee’s work,” Peduto said.

Peduto’s district includes Shady-
side and North Oakland.

Councilman District 7 Council-
man Patrick Dowd, whose‘ district in-

dent, he holds the responsibility
of forming the G-20 analysis com-
mittee, which had been previously
proposed by Dowd.‘ .

Shields said he wanted to wait
until the Citizen Police Review Board
establishes some facts before look-
ing at the arrests in Oakland. So far,
Shields said, the board has received
a “signiﬁcant number” of complaints
against officers.

He said there could be lawsuits as
a result of the complaints — some-
thing the city didn’t buy insurance
for because it didn’t expect them to
happen.

“In an event like this, you really

had.” She talked about students who
said they didn’t know where to dis-
perse.
_ “You may think that the Pitt
students should have stayed away,
but they’re college students, and
something exciting was occurring
on campus, so they felt they were
compelled to watch,” she said.

She said Pittsburgh looked like a
scene from “another country.” ~

“Last week was not a success,” the
woman said. “City Council — please
launch an investigation into this.”

"LBBT ATHLETES AND LLLIES“
In 2000, when Brian Sims  
was the captain of the
Bloomsburg University
football team, the un-
thinkable happened: He
was outed to his team-
mates. Though he was
afraid that his outing
would ruin his college
football career, it actually
brought the team closer
together during what
would be the greatest
season in the school’s his-
tory. The regional All-
American became the only
openly gay college football
captain in NCAA history
and the most notable col-
lege player to ever come
out.

Who knew a bake sale could protest gender

‘discrimination?

Pitt’s Campus Women’s Organization sold
brownies, cupcakes and cookies yesterday to
raise awareness for the gender wage gap —

Pennsylvania has an
earnings gap of 73
percent between men
and women.

symbolically charging women 75 cents for every
man’s dollar on baked goods.

Joy Horner, president of the organization,
said a former member who graduated came
up with the idea.

“We didn’t even think about it,” Horner
said.

“It’s part of our socialization,” memberKeely
McCaskie added.

McCaskie said this kind of socialization is
the conditioning ofwomen to believe ina“Cin-
derella situation.” .

Edie Cook, president of the Fox Chapel area
branch of the American Association ofUniver-
sity Women, spoke to about 20 women and a
man on the socialization of women last night
at the William Pitt Union.

Cook said one of the biggest obstacles to

Campus Women’s Organization sells brownies to ﬁght wage gap

women in the work place today is the illusion
that “if I’rn good, if I work hard enough, I will
be awarded.” _

“Men ask for things women don’t even real-
ize they can ask for,” she said.

Cook described her ﬁrst experience with .

the gender wage gap.

She said she was training a new hire for her
employer of ﬁve years. In the course other train-
ing, she discovered her trainee was making
signiﬁcantly more than her. ‘

She mentioned it to her boss — who gave
her a raise of $130 that same week.

Lauren Baines, the organization’s vice presi-
dent, said there was another reason for the
wage gap. . _

A “Its because we have vaginas,” she said.

The group proceeded to discuss how the
overlap of prime promotional years in the busi-
ness world with prime conceiving years in the
biological world could be an impediment to
Women’s progress in closing the wage gap.

Members of the organization encouraged

r attendees tolwrite letters to state senators be-

fore they went home. They hope the letters
will express the support of the pending equal
pay legislation.

The event was especially relevant to Penn-
sylvania, which is currently ranked 43rd in dis-
crepancy between men’s wages and Women’s

-wages, said Robin Lane, the group’s political

action chair.

Pennsylvania has an earnings gap of 73 per-
cent between men and women, according to the
American "Association of University Women.

Despite the choice of a bake sale to raise
awareness, Hornerinsisted the groupwas not
comprised of “home—makers.” _

“I was proud the brownies. My ﬁrst batch
was horrible.” .

Pitt police lead

0 say that police actions

I over ‘the weekend have
left a lot of students mad
would be an understatement.

Students are disillusioned with
the law, and perhaps none are

' angrier than those arrested for

being — in their terms — on-
lookers. But amid the scathing
criticisms, police — at least the
Pitt police —— are doing some-
thing right in the aftermath, just
as many of them did in the middle
of the chaos. - .
Pitt police are being far more
proactive than the city police.
Pitt police, along with nine
other police forces arrested near-
ly 200 individuals — mostly for

failure to disperse, disorderly '

conduct and criminal mischief.
Pitt police chiefTim Delaney said
he’s working with the district at-
torney to drop charges for some
students arrested Thursday and
Friday night. Of the 188 arrested,
Delaney believes about a quar-
ter to be Pitt students, and those
with failure to disperse charges

. and disorderly conduct charg-

es might be able to have their
charges dropped. Delaney said
he himself cannot dismiss the
charges, but he can recommend
the district attorney do so. Those
students he meets with will have
a chance to explain their situa-
tion. The district attorney has
already dropped four students’
charges, because of the quick re-
sponse by the Pitt police.y.

made the majority of arrests. So
what are they doing tohelp those
who may have been wrongly ar-

' rested‘?

According to the deputy city
police chief, Pittstudents who
can prove they were .“caught up”
with protestors might be able
to have their charges dismissed
—- an action with good inten-
tion. But students with pending
charges need concrete help and
they need it soon.‘Not to mention
this standard requires students
to prove their innocence, which
isn’t exactly how things are sup-
posed to work.

Students arrested over the
weekend in Oakland need their
charges dropped" right away if

they were, in fact, only bystand- _

ers. Soon, they’ll have court dates

to attend. If they’re looking to

ﬁght their charges, some will
want to hire attorneys — a pro-

cess that is, expensive and time

consuming. This situation fur-
thers the need to accelerate the
process.

The student bystanders forced -

into handcuffs those nights have
faced enough problems at the
hands of the law. They’ve faced
humiliation and, if nothing else,
one hell of a headache. Yes, in
some situations it was undoubt-

edly difficult for police to discern ~

who might have been a volatile
protesterand whowas just an
onlooker. But now the riots
are over. While the authorities
should seek to prosecute the real
wrongdoers, at this point, their
priority should be quickly clear-

j ing charges from those wrongly

arrested.

Old phone, new meaning  

Despite its mammoth size, on old phone can have therapeutic benefits

Once upon a time, my sister’s cell

It was supposed to be mine, but

But I could not continue to live my life

And yet, with an upgrade no lon-
ger available, it was my only option It
looked like I would have to transfer my
contacts and information to an old cell
phone that happened tobelyingaround

that weighed at least 65 pounds. The
phone was cumbersome, ugly and

leaders with kid gloves and granted
them international legitimacy by en—
gaging them diplomatically.

Obama-should recognize that the
Iranian government thrives on illu-

every time that Obama refers to Iran
as an “Islamic republic,” he is par-

representative government.

Seth Glier; a 20-year-old piano-play-
ing falsetto, fondly recalled the time
he played in front of roughly 20,000
people at the National Mall.

“I think I  that when Iwas 16 or
17,” Glier said. “We had this really kind
ofpictnresque stage where, aswe were
performing, the sun was setting right
behind the Washington Monument.
So you would .look out from stage at

Seth’s music — a delicate strain of

piano pop—hastal<enhimon multiple
tours across the country, to venues big
and small. But it evolved at home in a
musically eclectic household.

“My father would listen to every-
thing ﬁom Middle Eastern trans-Si-
berian punk to Charlotte Church and
Enya,” Glier said.

. Although he has a long history of .
performance — singing the national
anthem during Little League games
were his ﬁrstlive gigs — Glier said he
was never inspired to write songs until
the events of Sept. 11.

“I went to a very small, hill-town
countryhighschool, and we just didn’t
talk about 9/11,” Glier said. “I feel like

He enrolledinBerklee College ofMusic,
where he studied underhis mentor Liv-

a yearwhen he found he had begun to
deﬁne himself“less as a musician and
more as a writer.”

As awriter, Glier tries to counter to
the model of the -repetitive pop song,
whichhecalls,“bandintheboxinterrns

Glier said he prefers to emulate a
romantic American icon: the helpless,
everyday people. \

“I tend to take .on characters of
other people,” Glier said. “I like to tell

who aren’t telling the stories for them-

Diving headﬁrst into the lives
of a wide variety of talented stu-

“Fame” blatantly struggles to
grasp onto the coattails of “High

There are plenty of characters
on display: the shy actress (Kay
Panabaker), her too—cute love
interest (Asher Book), the good-
girl—waiting-to—go-diva (Naturi
Naughton), a dancer born without
a personality (Kherington Payne,
hot off her “So You Think You Can

young actors who appear to rel-

Stahl: It’s okay to steal ideas, make your own

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

I started using Twitter recently. A little late in
the game, Iknow. ‘
I haven’t done a whole lot with it yet. At this

. point, the sole reason I joined Twitteris to follow

the entire Kardashian family. There’s something
particularly warming about knowing exactly
when Kim is headed to the gym or how happy

Khloe is about getting married that I couldn’t '

resist any longer.

My weird obsessionwith the Kardashianfam-
ily is hardto explain. I’rn certainly not suggesting
that these girls are intellectual role models. No
——Iwould never recommend that anyone drive
under the inﬂuence (Khloe) or make a sex tape
(Kim). The family, in case you don’t know, is a
group of people famous for no signiﬁcant reason
otherthanthat Ryan Seacrest decided they’d be
entertaining enough to have a reality show on E!

.Really,Ithinkthe reason Iglikethem so muchis by A

that they dress well.

There’s something about having style that '

makes you a more intriguing person. Think the
Olsen twins. I harbor quite the ﬁxation on the
Michelle Tanner duo, not because oftheir acting
skills ——- trust me. I’ve seen “New York Minute,”

‘ and that’s exactly how long it took for me to

forget it. But because of their fashion sense, I’m
a total sucker for anything with an Olsen twin

‘on it. Mary—Kate’s the cover girl of some fashion

magazine? I’ll buy the issue right now. .

I’m hesitant to use the term “girl crush” be-
cause it’s alittle too Seventeen magazine for me.
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been afan of the glossy
since middle school and enjoy reading about
packing the perfect healthy lunchbox as much
as the next girl, but as I approach the age of 22,
I feel like I shouldn’t be relating to their cover
features anymore. I’rn not exactly hankering to
steal Hannah Montana’s style secrets. Give me
more creditthan that —— I’n1 at least up to Selena
Gomez’s level

Anyway, I’ll admit that I have a passionate-
ly idolizing view of certain people. I’m a huge
fan of Kate Winslet More for her regal beauty
than style choices, though they’ve certainly irn—
proved recently. Thank God you can’t trot up
to the stage and grab that Academy Award in
a potato sack.

My love for Rachel Bilson was delayed, for I
refused to watch the ﬁrst season of “The O.C.”
because it all seemed too dramatic. Then my
hairdresser convinced me to watch a few epi-
sodes, just for the clothes. ‘

“Sam, these girls are goingto dictate fashion
right now,” he proclaimed likethe Vogue version
of Nosferatu. ‘

So Iwatched; my hairdresserwas right. Since
the show’s unfortunate ending, Miss Bilson has
continued to impress me with her ability to put
together casual but completely on-trend day-
wear. .

Sincejosh Schwartz has aknackfor selecting
“It Girls,” I also must thank him for giving me
Leighton Meester. Her headband-wielding“Gos-
sip Girl” character Blair Waldorf is a personal
favorite of mine. This is another instance inwbich

I was ﬁrst sucked into a television show for the
sole purpose of wardrobe analysis.

My tomboy roots relate to British transplant
Alexa Chung’s quirkypairings, while myfeminine
side lives for Scarlett]ohansson’s ultra-fe_mme,
retro ensembles.

I look to  of these girls for fashion inspira-
tion when I’m stuck in a style rut. There’s nothing
that pulls you out of the wardrobe doldrums
quite like a quick flip through a celebrity-laden
magazine. That’s not to say you shouldn’t come
up with your own clothing ideas, though.

You know that scene in “Mean Girls” where A

Gretchen is crying in the girls’ bathroom? She’s

explaining how Regina wouldn’t let her wear
those “really expensive white gold hoops” be-
cause they were “her thing.” I shouldn’t admit
thisbut, I’ve always sided with Regina onthis one.
Her desire to be unique is practically a fashion
commandment.

And yet, I’matotal hypocrite. To borrow the
words of Chuck Palahniuk, “Nothing of me is
originaL I am the combined effort of everybody
I’ve ever known.” I’m constantly on the lookout
for outﬁt inspiration. The amount of time I spend
readingfashion blogs is probably on parwith the
most dedicated cancer research labs.

I actively follow what people are wearing

and subtly let it inﬂuence my own ensembles.
Personal style is a stealth operation. Copying
another’s look too blatantly is a major fashion.-2
offense. The trick is to draw influence from a
pool of sources wide enoughthatthe exact origin
can’t be placed.

So the moral of the story: Cast a wide net,
ﬁsh around for ideas and then make them your
own. Feel free to show me the outﬁts you come .
up with on Twitter —— just don’t be offended if If H '
end up stealing your ideas.

Adams to lead women’ 3 tennis this

Junior Elizabeth Adams had a strong showing in her Honors Singles appearance last weekend

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

It seems like Elizabeth Adams is
going to do just ﬁne in her junior
season. A
Last year, Adams teamed up
with now-graduated senior Kristy
Borza on her way to 25 wins — a
single-season record at Pitt -—— in
No. 1 doubles.
But despite the loss of Borza, Ad-
Jams looked sharp on her way to an

Honors Singles ﬁnals appearance 

at a tournament in West Point this
past weekend.

 

The purpose of

these early season
tournaments is to face
ﬁne competition.

George Dieﬁenbach —

That’s good news for the Pan-
thers, who are expecting big things
from Adams this year.

“She picked herself back up
[after her second-round loss] and
beat some good players,” head coach

George Dieffenbach said. “She made
good progress this weekend andwill
get better after this toumamen ”

l The Panthers were one of nearly
30 teams to travel to New York for
the West Point Eastern Tennis Invi-
tational —. the ﬁrst of the year for
Pitt.

As the No.5 seed in the touma—
ment, Adams fell to Victoria Aiello
from Middleburg College in the sec-
ond round of No. 1 singles, but that
didn’t slow her down. She went on
to ﬁnish second in her consolation
bracket, the Honors Singles-

It was a strong showing, but not ‘

the only one for the Panthers at -the
tournament. . '
-Sophomore Minh Evans, who
started out playing in the No. 4
singles bracket, lost to Lauren Rott-

kamp of Bucknell in the ﬁrst round. _

But she went on to capture the Faith
Singles title. '

Both Evans and Adams ﬁnished
the tournament going 2-2.

Their success comes as no sur-

prise to Dieffenbach. The Panthers _

are coming off a successful season,
which included a 12-10 overall record
and a 6-3 showing in Big East play.

“It’s a very strong tournament,”
he said. “The purpose of these early
season tournaments is to face ﬁne
competition. [Adams and Evans]
grew from this and it will help
them.”

Last year also marked the highest
ﬁnish at the Big East Championships
for the Panthers. Pitt tied for seventh
after entering the tournament as the
No. 9 seed. A

In the conference tournament,
Adams led the Panthers toa ﬁrst-
round defeat of Cincinnati in the Big

"East Championships — the victory

was the ﬁrst—ever for the team in the

.ﬁrst round of the tournament.

She ﬁnished the season witha

22-6 record, was named the team . 
MVP after the tournament,-and T
-earned All-Big Easthonors after
"the season.‘ ’ '2 i“~'“‘”'*"“'l A  A 

Adams looks to lead the Panthe
this year, but other athletes are also
stepping up. Senior Shannon Benic
(2-2) and junior Adela Aprodu (1-1)
also collected wins at the Invita-
tional. . .

' Benic took part in the third sin-
gles bracket, losing her ﬁrst match
but advancing to the semiﬁnals of
the consolation bracket. In the No.
2 singles bracket, Aprodu won her
ﬁrst round matchup before falling
in the Round of 16.

In doubles action, freshmen
Karma Parbhu and Gabrielle Cat-
anzariti went 4-2 on the weekend
and ﬁnished third in the Lichtenberg
Doubles bracket. Two of their wins
came against conference opponents
Alexandra Harvey and Slavina Ka-
planska of Seton Hall.

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Junior Elizabeth Adams lost in the Honors Singles ﬁnals in this-past
weekend’s tournament, but head .coach George Dieffenbach thinks the
team learned a lot in West Point and will be ready forthe spring season.

For Dieffenbach, early season
wins against Big East rivals are some-
thing to keep in mind. .

“That’s what we want,” he said
about the doubles wins. “We want to

g be able to face teams we’ll see later

on. We have conﬁdence heading into

the spring season that we can beat
Big East opponents.”

The Panthers willtake part intwo
more tournaments before the winter
break. They will be in Norfolk, Va.,
this weekend to take part in the Ser-

V gio Tacchini Invitational.

Cat heads, garne——f1Xing, adultery and more!’

Who knew sports could be so scandalous?

Littman 4 10

ofﬁciated and is now in jail for allegedly violat-
ing his probation, claimed Stem told oﬂicials
to ﬁx games during the 2006 play-offs and not
to call fouls on star players.

Fixing games doesn’t bother me. Telling

. oﬂicials not to call fouls on star players is just

smart planning. But suspending the greatest
playerinthe history ofyour sport fortvvo years
when he’s only 30 years old and has led his
team to the last three NBA titles? That’s athing
of beauty. I -
Secondly: Did former New York MetKevin
Mitchell cut the head off of his girlfriend’s cat?
In his 1999 autobiography, Mitchell’s former
teammate Dwight Gooden said he went to
Mitchell’s apartment and saw an incredibly
angry Mitchell cutting the head off his girl-
friend’s cat. In a book about the 1986.Mets by
Jeff Pearlman, Mitchell vehemently denied, the
story. I really want to know if Mitchell cut the
head off that cat because, well, because it’s a
story about him cutting the head off a cat and

and two meaning a breaking p-itch. A player in .

the bullpen would toss aball in the airto signal
fastball, or nottoss a ball to say abreakingball
was coming. _

While some players have admitted doing it,
Thomson said he didn’t know what pitch was
coming and hasn’t budged from that stance.

Is Kareem Abdul—Jabbaractually two men in
a 7—foot—2'—inch costume? A little known rumor
is that two men — Kareem Abdul and Kareem

Jabbar—_with decent basketball abilities de-
cided if theyjoined forces they could dominate
the sport. This one might have been made up
like 10 seconds ago, but has anyone proven
this isn’t true? ’

Did Alex Rodriguez really try to sleep with

Jose Canseco’s wife? Canseco claims A-Rod did,
but A-Rod denies it. Canseco has been right
about pretty much everything he’s claimed in

the past, yet seems very sleazy. He might have

twisted some compliments from Rodriguez '

into a full-on crush.

Mainlylwantto knowifthisistruebecause
my theory is the only reason Canseco wrote
his two books about the rampant steroid use,
in baseball is to get back at A-Rod. He inadver-
tently blew open the biggest sports story in the
past decade just because A-Rod tried to sleep
with his wife. It’s quite possible that Jessica
Canseco saved baseball.

  

 

Secondly: Did former New
York Met Kevin Mitchell
cut the head off of his
girlfriend’s cat?

that’s just weird.

Also: Did a certain loud-mouthed pitcher
from the 2004 Red Sox really give an underage
girl Quaaludes at Jack Nicholson’s house and
sleep with her‘? Oh, wait, no. That was Roman
Polanski. Sorry.

Next, did Bobby Thomson of the then—New
York Giants know what pitchwas coming from
the Dodgers’ Ralph Branca when Thompson hit
his famous home run to win the 1951 National
League pennant? The homer capped off an
improbable run by. the Giants, who erased a
13.5 game deﬁcit in less than ‘a month. The
home rim, alongwith armouncer Russ Hodges’
screaming, “The Giants win the pennant! The
Giants win the pennant!” is one of baseball’s
most iconic moments. But is it tarnished?

In 2001, the Wall Streetjournal published
an article in which Giants players from that year
— Monte Irvin, catcher Sal Yvars and pitcher
Al Gettel~— admitted that the team stole signs
from the opposing teams’ catchers and relayed

- them to Giants hitters so that they knew what

pitch to expect.

The Giants supposedly hada coach in the
Giants’ clubhouse in centerﬁeld using binocu-
lars to look at the catcher’s signs. The coach
would then signal players inthe bullpen witha
buzzer system, with one buzz meaningfastball
