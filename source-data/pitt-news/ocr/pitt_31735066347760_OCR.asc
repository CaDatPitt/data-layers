Senate Hearing Board Reviews

Nyden Case In FinalAppeal Stage‘

By MREA CSORBA

Paul Nyden’s ﬁght to retain his
teaching position at Pitt is down to
the wire as the last University
grievance channel reviews his
charge of political discrimination
involving his termination effective
this Saturday.

A panel of four representatives
from the University Senate Council
and an independent faculty mem-
ber, law professor Richard Seeber-
ger, who was chosen by Chancellor

eWesley Posvar to chair the board,
are charged with making,a speciﬁc
recommendation to the Chancellor
for either “no action”—which
would ﬁnalize Nyden’s termina-

tion—or for the immediate renewal
of the assistant sociologist’s initial
three-year contract.

This review, granted by the
Chancellor at Nyden’s request, is
the ﬁfth internal evaluation of the
Marxist sociologist’s case in a little
over a year.

‘ Nyden appealed to Posvar for this
ﬁnal review following FAS Dean
Jerome Rosenberg’s refusal to
appoint a non-partisan
sociology panel to review his works.
Such an ad hoc committee was
recommended by the previous
review committee, the FAS Tenure
and Promotions hearing board,
which studied Nyden’s case last fall
term. '

Caryl Kline Appointed

Secretary of Education

Caryl M. Kline, Pitt's director of
Continuing Education for Women,
was confirmed by the Pennsylvania
State Senate last Wednesday for the
$44,000 post of Secretary of
Education. -

The appointment has been
regarded as a patronage position
from Lt. Governor Ernest Kline (no
relation), although during hearings
on her appointment Kline denied
this. i

Kline has been affiliated with Pitt
since 1964, when she took the
position of Assistant to the
Chancellor under Chancellor Ed-‘
ward H. Litchfield.

Kline also has been involved in
various pursuits ‘related to educa-
tion; member North Allegheny

School Board from 1959-1964;
President of the Bradford Woods
School Board (Pa.) 1960-1964) and
as consultant to Women’ s In stituted
program run by the Department of
Education of Sierra Leone Govern-
ment 1954-55.

She was also appointed i by
President John F. Kennedy as
Special Ambassador to Sierra
Leone.

Kline is currently a member of
the Pittsburgh City Planning
Commission, the Committee on
Affirmative Action, Pennsylvania
Department of Health and Welfare,
the~Board of Trustees of Allegheny
General Hospital, and other com-

1 mittees as well.

Unlike that committee’s recom-

coming conclusion from the Senate
Council panel should be decisive,
according to University Senate
President Gerald Massey.

“This is a very serious matter.
The University Senate Council’s
hearing board is the ultimate faculty
appeals body, and their recom-

mendation will be absolutely-

decisive,” Massey maintained. “It
would be a great jeopardy for the
administration not to heed the
recommendation of a duly appoint-
ed hearing board.”

According to University Senate President Gerald Massey, the opinion delivered
by the University Senate Hearing board on Paul Nyden’s appeal “will be ab- ‘

solutely decisive" in determining whether his three-year teaching contract.
due to expire this Saturday, will be renewed in the final appeals channel.

country’s social, cultural and
political aspects.

“We were told to stay away from
politics, ’ ’ junior David Boehm said.
Despite this warning, he chose to
lstudy the life and death of Latin
American sociologist and revolu-
ttionary priest, Camile Torres.

Another participant in the
program sponsored and ﬁnanced by
Pitt’s Latin American Studies
department surveyed her fellow
expedition participants about their
feelings towards Columbians,
Boehm said. She will re-survey the
group on their return to determine if
attitudes change as facts challenge
stereotypes.

Still all is not politics, with
Columbia boasting a wealth of art
ranging from pre-conquest to
contemporary themes. These
treasures will be the topic of another
participant’s report.

Selected from about 30 applicants
for the annual program, each
student will receive nine credits for
his participation in weekly seminars
conducted last term and the trip,
which culminates in a long research
paper on their findings.

University ofﬁcials and panel

commenting on the review pro-

untypical stance, Nyden too has
reserved comment until the panel

ENERGY ROADBLOCKS
ATTACKED

HARRISBURG (AP)—A pro-
posal to clear away many of the
roadblocks holding up construction
of energy plants around the state
was introduced in both the House
and Senate yesterday.

The bill would create a “one-
stop" state agency to handle all
site and construction permits.

Local and country governments
would be offered grants and loans
to win their approval for energy
plants.

The $14 million annual cost
would be paid from an extension of
the gross receipts tax to 12
out-of-state utilities that run power
plants in Pennsylvania.

The bill's sponsors hope the
money incentives will overcome
some of the local opposition that
killed the energy park idea.

FREEDOM or THE

Pottsville Republican and -other
heirs of the newspaper’s founder

are ﬁghting court appointment of

two trustees. which they claim.

threatens freedom of the press.

The dispute. revolving around
the issue of freedom of the press,
reached its local climax a week ago
when Schuylkill County Judges
James J. Curran and Guy A. Bowe
brushed aside objections of the
heirs and conﬁrmed appointment
of two of their banker friends as
trustees. They also appointed a
third banker who had been
recommendedlby the lone surviving
trustee.

The newspaper in recent years
has been critical of .the Curran
family. which has

dominated

 

Democratic politics in the county ,

and also has had a voice in the
area's economy through its control
of the Reading Anthracite Co. and
radio station .WPAM.

“We became concerned when
the court appointed as a trustee of
the newspaper trust someone who
comes out of the interlocking
family, business and other rela-
tionships among President Judge
Curran, his son, and his nephew,"
Martz said.

"7; Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

To Stop A Hike

The third, or as it is sometimes called, summer term started yesterday
for College of Arts and Sciences students.

This term is noted for its painfully long classes, as 15 weeks of
informationiscramrnedintonine. It isfulloftemptinglyhotdays when
studentsmustresi_sttlie urgeto sunbatheonthe Cathedral lawn instead

of attending class.

Fewer studentsiattend summer classes. So it is the term noted for
attempts by the administration trying to railroad programs through
before students come back in September.

, Tuitionhikes alwayshappeninthe summer. Not enough students are
around who care enough to voice opposition. So even those who care
about student input ﬁnd none and allow an increase to go through.

It's still early in the term so no one in administrative circles has
uttered the words ‘ ‘tuition hike’ ’ when next year’s budget is discussed.
Noﬁnalﬁgureshavebeenset,itistoosoontotell. ’

Itwouldbealot easierfor students to stop atuition hike ifit was
merely a question of squaring off against the administration. But the
mere presence of opposition will not bring in money to avert the

- intrease. To prevent an increase and also not cutback operations and
services is a feat similar to the proverbial squeezing of blood from

turnips.

Pitt is in the red because Governor Shapp short-changed its budget
request by aproximately $7 million. Sothe lowkey approach being made
by the Student Government and the  is the right move to

make so far.

Theyareriieetirigoneononeyvithlegislatorsinan attemptto getthe
state senate to approve abudget that is amended to improvePitt’s ﬁscal

situation.

. Ifthislfails, or falls short, it is up to Student Govermnent and the
administrationtoworktogethertocutwaste fromthe budget inorderto
balance it without the loss of essential services.

What’ one side calls an essential service and what the other side
considers necessary can be as different as night and day. Compromise
will be necessary. The administration must seek student input and the
Student Government must assert its right to provide it.

Only by working together can these two groups turn around the
downhill slide quality education has made here in recent years.

 

In response to the Pitt News
article of April 6 headlined, “Two
Blast Bullman, ’ ’ I would like to offer
some of the impressions I had as a
former Pantherette volleyball play-
er concerning Ms. Bullman and her
interplay with the vollyball pro-
gram.

To begin, I was extremely
disappointed to learn of the
resignation of Coach Mary Kromer
Picchi over the issue of control of

her team. Having played under her V

direction for three years in high
school, I knew her as a strong and
competent coach, one who knew her
sport and was ﬁnely skilled in
dealing with the individuals who
made up her team. Learning of

incidents wherein Ms. Bullman had
tried to interfere with her style of
coaching irritated me immensely,
and all the more because her own
knowledge of volleyball was so
limited. Hiring a coach should
involve a measure of trust in that

person’s judgments and talents, as
well as a respect for her freedom to
coach without pressure. Looking
back on the 1975 season it is easy to

see that Mrs. Picchi was not
afforded these basic deferences. It
was due only to her determination
not to effect the play and morale of
the team that she never indicated
the pressure to which she was
subjected.

Letters To The Editor

  Theatre Patron
In Ticket Mixup

I would like to comment on the
ticket policy at the Studio Theater. I
came to Pittsburgh from Madison,
Wisconsin, for Easter vacation.
Twice reservations were made for
the Saturday, April 9 performance
of “Three Sisters.-” »We arrived at
the theater at 7:55 and were
informed quite abruptly that our
‘ ‘reserved’ ’ tickets had been sold to
earlier patrons. We were not aware
that we had to purchase these
tickets twenty minutes prior to
curtain time (if such a policy exists).
So-I drove.600 miles and left the
Studio Theater with a bitter

  Letter Adds toBu||man Gripes

As far as the members of the
team, there was also an almost
universal disapproval of Ms.
Bullman and her actions. In
speaking directly to the girl
involved, I learned of Ms.
Bullman’s conversation with one of
the players between games at 1974
regionals wherein it was suggested
that the team was losing specifically
because of that player’s perfor-
mance. I knew players who were
promised four-year scholarships by
Ms. Bullman when it was properly
the coach's place, and not hers, to
decide the question of who would
receive aid. I also knew of the
pressure placed on Kathy I-Iudgens
to play as if healthy or to lose the
scholarship which had brought her
to Pitt, and countless other similar
incidents. Yet at each collective
meeting of the women’s athletic
teams over which Ms. Bullman
presided, we were smilingly
reminded of the concern the athletic
department supposedly had for us
as individuals as well as athletes. I
suggest that the above incidents
were poor evidences of that
concern. .
As I am no longer involved with
the women’s athletic program at
Pitt, my interest in this issue is
solely in sympathy to those who
have been hurt by Ms. Bullman’s
policies and attitudes. Perhaps by
now the ﬁrings and resignations are
a page of Pitt's history, and the
ex-coaches’ names are merely
memorials to a time which is no
longer. Yet what remains are
athletes and coaches of this year
and next whose careers will be
either formed or deformed by those
same attitudes.

impression of Pitt theater.

I have lived in Wisconsin for two
years and every chance I get, I
inform my friends here how less
bureaucratic and more efficient
events and operations are handled
at Pitt. I always say that Pitt serves
the people. But the Studio Theater
policy is a disgrace compared to the
professionalism of the University
Theater at the University of
Wisconsin. Their ticket policy

invites, season_ subscriptions at

both student and general public
prices. They maintain box office
hours for the general public and
present ten performances for each
production. The caliber of the
actors and the variety of the
productions are exceptional. This
season they have presented “Six
Characters in Search of an Author, ’ ’
“The Trojan Woman,” “The
Doctor in Spite of Himself, ’ ’ among
others. In -the past they have
presented “Death of a Salesman,”
“Kennedy’s Children,” and “The
Little Foxes.” I hope that in the
future the Studio Theater can
conduct its theatrical season in the
same way.

Security Policy
Questioned

I am writing a simple inquiry:

’What would happen if for some
V reason the University police actual-

ly were around when they were
supposed to be or if the University
really had an effective security
system?

I must admit I don’t spend more
than 60 or 70 hours on campus
weekly, mostly at the Graduate.
School of Public Health, so I don’t
know where else they may be. But
it’s safe to say that except for
morning coffee breaks in the GSPH
cafeteria they're seldom around
these parts. But, Iguess  there’s
no need for them to be.

Possibly they have managed to
solve the burglary in several offices
on the second floor of GSPH which
happened a few weeks ago; or
maybe they have found the “purse
stealer’ ’ who frequents the building
particularly on payday; or maybe
they are satisfied with the weekend
security aides who require the
faculty and students to “sign in"

into the building must tempt those
who are in the building who should‘
not be. But then again, who needs
to sneak in? They can sign in as
“John Doe” and no one would
I wonder if “A.
Burglar” has even signed in?

And for goodness sake, let me not

understand that the entire Univers-

ity faculty and staff should schedule
their work around the hours set by
our efficient University security
office. Just because‘ it’s a weekend
or early morning hours should be
enough to keep faculty and staff
away from their offices and their
work which only needs attention
during the selected hours set by the
University security. Then again, I
shouldn’t complain, it’s not infre-
quent that they are seen ticketing
cars’ ‘illegally parked, -which will
likely increase now that the warm
weather is returning. After all,
that’s a hard job.

Oh, and I forgot to thank them.
After being called last weekend at
noon to unlock the building so

people doing research or studying 

could enter, they did manage to
come “and open the door from
inside the building,” 20 minutes
later. But then again, I guess I

‘ shouldn’t be sarcastic. I'm sure it’s
only my perception that the
University security is doing such a
ﬁne job. After all, if you’re ever in
need, simply yell”help.” And 
good luck. I

I would like to respond to the
letter by Ms. Sharon DePue printed
in the Pitt News of Wednesday,
March 30, 1977.

To set the record straight, Jewish
students are not excused from
classes on the high holy days of
Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur.
We must attend classes at the
University on these days the same
as any day. And, should we decide
not to attend, the work missed must
also be made up.

As for Ms. DePue’s feeling that
she is being discriminated against,
please remember the University is
excused for Christmas but not for
Hanukah. Now who is the target of
discrimination? -

Carter Energy Plan, Nation's Reaction Assessed

'procedures to make licensing of
these cars increasingly expensive
and difficult. Recent claims by
General Motors and other manufac-

reasonably-appointed, full-sized
cars satisfactorily fuel-efficient.
The only automobiles that need fall
under this tax are America’s
beloved over-weight, unnecessarily
powerful, automatic-everything
dreamboats. Actually, such cars
should probably be prohibited
altogether—being able to afford it
should not constitute a license to be

By GARY GOVERT

President Carter has often been
accused of being a man “whowants
nothing more than to be well-
liked.” If so, he has certainly
chosen to consolidate his popularity
in an odd fashion.

Now that the Administration’s
comprehensive national energy
program has been dropped into the
American public’s lap, both ideo-
logical and sentimental loyalties to
Mr. Carter are likely to wane.
Consumers, energy corporations,
auto manufacturers, and congress
will anguish loudly over parts of the
program that threaten to thin their
wallets, cut their profits, or harm
their chances for reelection. The
energy debate has the potential to
be pocketbook politics’ ﬁnest hour.

An important part of the nation’s
future direction will be determined
during the coming months. We are
forced at long last to choose
between a responsible approach to
energy consumption and the
ultimate collapse that continuation
of present attitudes will bring. The
choice made will tell us whether the
wisdom for which Americans have
traditionally congratulated them-
selves does in fact exist.

Though not without its foggy
areas and apparent faults, the
Administration’ s energy program is
acgood one, relatively solid ground
upon which to build consumption
patterns that reﬂect a realistic view
of environmental limits.

Short of severe rationing, stiff
taxes on oil and gas are probably the
most effective means of encoura-
ging conservation. Because it
“would not solve long range
problems of dwindling supplies,”
President Carter has rightly rejec-
ted immediate decontrol of oil and
natural gas prices. As a result,
increased taxes are needed if
Americans are to be introduced to

the real cost of energy. Returning
these taxes to the public in a manner
that would reward those who
conserve is a good idea, but there
are several things to keep in mind
here:

1) Low-income families will be
hardest hit by these taxes, so any
rebates should be distributed
accordingly. Care must be taken
that the poor aren’t driven further
into the hole while wealthier
citizens . (Who are ,, better able to
conserve) simply absorb an incon-
sequential few dollars more. It
should also be remembered that
without conservation now the poor
will be in an even worse position in
the future.

2) It is essential that labor and
industry refrain from matching

higher energy costs with increased »

wage and price demands. The

spectre of inflation looms large
unless both groups realize that
energy and environmental ‘respon-
sibilities are every bit as important
as take-home pay and the bottom
line. If one group can afford a

   

reduction in disposable income or
proﬁts better than the other, then

that is the sacriﬁce it must make.

Unless “the American spirit’ ’ is just
a- pseudonym for'greed, we should

be able to curb or energy a . etites

  

necessarily mean as much as they
can get.’ Immediate decontrol
would certainly increase produc-
tion, but the last thing we need now
is a continued illusion of abun-
dance. Thomas Aquinas, com-
menting 700 years ago on profit

    

motivation, noted that it recognized
no natural limits and tended toward
inﬁnity. So it is today, in an energy
scenario that is anything but
inﬁnite.

before wage» and price controls
become necessary.

In a similar vein, if the burden of
belt-tightening must be shared by
labor and industry, so should any
rewards for conservation (i.e.,
rebates or tax breaks). To do
otherwise could foster resentment
and might very well work against
the goals sought. On the other
hand, those who refuse to conserve
should get nothing but trouble.

3) There are no provisions in the

(Continued from Page 6)

President’s plan for improvements
in mass transit. (According to Mr.
Carter, such improvements are
being handled separately by the
Dept. of Transportation.) Trains
and buses are among the most fuel-
efﬁcient means of transportation we
have, but in many cities inadequate
service and exorbitant fares prevent
people from using them. Diverting
large amounts of new tax revenues
into this area (and therefore
decreasing rebates) should be
seriously considered. Until the
improvements are made, however,
the public must be willing to
exchange convenience for conser«
vation. l -
The tax on ‘ ‘ gas-guzzlers” is long
overdue; the only question is
whether it is harsh enough. l- States
should now revise registration
Tax incentives designed to
encourage home insulation and
other individual conservation
measures will probably meet with

little opposition.- The development -

of new fuel sources———particularly
renewable ones—-is essential if
consumption of scarce fuels is to be
cut signiﬁcantly. Until, safety
questions can be answered more
fully, the use of nuclear power
should be held to a tightly controlled
bare minimum. «

Industry and utilities are likely to
resist conversion from oil and gas to
coal, and at the same time they will
probably attempt to tie conversion
to a relaxation of environmental
standards. Any such maneuverings
must be strongly opposed if coal
reserves are to be effectively
utilized and if recent improvements
in air quality are to continue. Still,
we have to remember that coal has
its limits too, both physical and
environmental. Our aggregate use
of non—renewable, pollution-gener-
ating fuel sources can only grow so
much and go on so long. Ifwe could
view the world holistically (rather
than in the context of artiﬁcial
dichotomies such as economic
prosperity vs. environmental qual-
ity) we might ﬁnd that the absolute
limits to energy use have already
been reached, at least for thetime
being.

Important as the ramiﬁcations of
speciﬁc measures are, they are as
individual leaves on a tree when
compared to the fundamental
direction of a total energy policy.
President Carter’s emphasis on
conservation—if it is strong enough
and persistent enougli—-—is an
important step in the right
direction. From simple conserva-
tion we can move toward a move
responsible, less selﬁsh perspective
on\ management of the earth's
resources.

But convincing Americans that
they must pay more and get less will
not be easy. Asking an American to
reduce consumption is tantamount
to asking him to change his religion.

As things now stand, those of us
who have the means to overcon-
sume do so, and those who don't
have the means want them. This
kind of attitude, operative in
government, business, and the
public at large, is the heart of the
energy problem. Unless it changes,
there can be no solution.

Boton Run
pllparwlﬁ 
Cup Of Tea,

By DAVE McDONALD

When one thinks of long
distance runners the first question

everyone invariably asks is: “Did
you ever run in the Boston
Marathon?"

In the latest Boston Marathon
held on Patriot’s Day April 18, an
unusually large contingent of Pitt
staff and students made the
three—hour qualifying time for men
and the three-and-one-half hour
qualifying time for women enabling

‘them toirun in the 81st annual 26

mile 385 yard race from Hopkinton,
Massachusetts to the Prudential
Center in downtown Boston.

Pitt was well represented at
Boston this year with over five

-runners competing in the race for

the Human Energy Road Racing
team, which is sponsored by'the
Human Energy Lab at Trees Hall.
Making the trip to Boston from
Pitt’s Human Energy team were
many‘ Pitt notables: Ed Barvick, an
anesthesiologist at Pitt, who also
tests human stress in the Human
Energy Lab in Trees Hall; Greg
Leroy, a doctoral student in
International Education; Tom Alli-
son. the founder of the team and a
doctoral student in Exercise Phy-
siology and a teacher in the
Physical Education department;
'55-year-old Cliff Ham, a professor
in the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, and Lisa
Matovcik, a lab technician in the
Micro Biology Lab and a part time
Pitt graduate student.

It was another hot day for the
26-mile conquest with tempera-
tures ranging from 75-80 degrees
at the starting line at high noon.
About 3,000 runners were officially
entered from the United States and
many foreign countries for the long
trek to Boston.

Ham, the senior member of the
team, was the only Human Energy
runner to not quite make it to the
Prudential Center due to a nagging
foot injury that forced him out of
the race with only the last grueling
six miles to complete.

The other Human Energy run-
ners faired much better though,
ﬁnishing in fifth place in the team
competition. Human Energy beat
other well-known teams such as the
Irish and Puerto Rican National

teams (Puerto Rico's National team
was the pre-race favorite, winning
in the past two years).

Tom Allison led the way for the
Pittsburgh runners, ﬁnishing a
respectable Slst place with a good
time of 2 hours, 29 minutes and 18
seconds.

' "‘I thought it was one of my best
performances in a marathon’ thus
far,” Allison said. “It wasn't my
fastest time for 26 miles,.but you
have to take into account the heat
and the headwind most of the
way."

Grey Leroy placed 73rd with a
time of 2:31.24; Skip Brown, a
native of Mt. Pleasant and a
Human Energy regular, finished
85th with a 2:32.26. Ed Barvick,

21-year-old Lisa Matovcik, run-

Panther Proflile

Felder Fulfilling Fond Dream

By MARY T. CONNORS

All his life, Pitt Panther LeRoy
Felder dreamed of a life in sports.
Ever since fourth grade he has
played one team sport or another,
including sandlot football, baseball
and basketball. V

For the 5-11, 190 pound defensive
cornerback, baseball was his first
love. He envisioned a professional
career as a shortstop until a
shoulder injury in his freshman year
at college wiped out those hopes.

But lucky for Felder, he excelled .

in other sports. While attending
high school in Baltimore he was
named a defensive All-American
and attracted overtures from
schools like Syracuse, Florida State ‘
and Kansas State in addition to Pitt.

LEROY FELDER

Felder said he opted for Pitt
because “their defense was not too
good, and I thought I’d get a chance
to play sooner.”

At first, it didn’t work out that
way.. During his freshman year he
injured his right shoulder and was
unable to play despite being listed
on the team’s traveling squad for
the Georgia game.

Felder didn’t get his big chance in
the collegiate ranks until his
sophomore year against Duke. He
intercepted an endzone pass in that
game. Felder considers the theft
his greatest moment in his playing
career.
In retrospect, Felder said he
never felt parental pressure push-
ing him to excel in sports.

Pressure, according to Felder,
came from another source.

‘ ‘The real pressure came from the
kids, especially the fans,” Felder
said.

He admitted “home fans inspire
you,” but he also confesses to an
occasional desire to silence an
obnoxious fan.

“What can you do? You can't go
up and hit him,” Felder said,
adding, “He (a fan), sees
something go wrong and just wants
to lay the blame on someone.
Sometimes I’m the unlucky one.”

Felder’s most loyal fans are
located on his dorm ﬂoor in Tower

C. He is accorded a hero’s welcome
after each game.

BE ABLE TO SAVE 400°

ON A PAIR OF THE COUNTRY’S
BEST SELLING LOUDSPEAKER
THE LARGE ADVENT

If you have been thinking of owning the most popular loudspeaker above $100,
now is your chance to buy it at a savings from Pittsburgh’s oldest authorized
Advent dealer, Opus One. You will receive the full 5 year warranty. The speaker’s
great popularity has come about because many satisfied Advent owners sound to
many other people. Consequently, some NON Advent dealers will advertise this
very desirable loudspeaker at a low price, and then attempt to change your mind
to their choice when you visit their store. This is called “bait and switch.” With this
authorized, current sale on the Advent speakers you get baited with no switch.

Following the game, however,
there was no sign of ABC showing
the Felder banner. Felder’s friends
learned from an intelligent by-
stander that they made a mistake
when they printed the words
“Orange Bowl” on the banner. It
turned out that rival NBC was
charged with airing the game and
wanted to avoid any free advertising
for the competition by showing the
banner on television.

Despite his friends, Felder’s idea.

of recognition is the crowd cheering
whenever he intercepts an enemy
pass.

This August, Pitt football will
have a new dimension in addition to
the new recruits working out with
the team. New head coach Jackie
Sherrill will now be running the
show, assuming the demanding role
of replacing Johnny Majors as head
man of a national champion.

Felder believes Sherrill is up to
the challenge.

“Sherrill isn’t exactly new to all
ofus,” he said. “He was here as an
assistant coach during my freshman
and sophomore years. I think we
have a good chance to repeat last
year’s showing.”

Meanwhile Felder is preparing
for training and the obligatory laps

cises, sit—ups and pull-"ups. Weight
lifts and running plays.

“I never really have time to get «

out of shape,” Felder said.

Despite the large amount of time
Felder puts into the game, football
is not his only interest. .

Schoolwork rates highly with
Felder. He tries to schedule his
classes around practice time and the
Fridays when the Panthers plays on
the road. Felder, an economics
major, maintains a 2.5 QPA.

“When I have to miss a class,” he
said, “I go to my instructor to ask
how I can make up the work I
missed.”

Felder, who will graduate next
year, is considering three options
for his future: a masters degree in
economics; “a good p job starting
about $17,000 with good chances for
promotions”; and landing a job in
professional football.

“I’d like to go in the first three
rounds,” Felder says of the
prospect of being drafted. He hopes
to be picked by a good team, like the
hometown Baltimore Colts.

g Felder is hoping his academic and
physical efforts will reward him in
the future and he’s aware that being
a professional football player will
give him a more “saleable name”
on the job market.

Theatre Express Rocks the ”Cats Cradle”

By PATTY TASCARELLA

It works as a play, too. Kurt
Vonnegut’s sciene ﬁction classic,
“Cat’s Cradle,” maintains its
frenetic pace when translated to the
stage via the antics of the Theatre
Express, a CMU based touring
company.

“Call me Jonah,” begins the
narrator. “My parents did, or
nearly did—they named me John. ’ ’

Jonah is a writer working _on a

Hiroshima. He wants some
background on what the late Dr.
Felix Hoenikker, “the father of the
bomb,” did on that fateful day and
contacts the ‘three Hoenikker
children—Frank, Angela, and
Newt.

Through a series of events, Jonah
winds up on the Caribbean island of
San Lorenzo and meets up with the
dictator “Papa” Monzano, his
adopted daughter Mona, and an
outlawed religious leader named
Bokonon. Also on hand is the

Suspense Builds In
”Mirro District”

By PATTY TASCARELLA

In the Mirro District & Other Stories
By Peter Taylor
Alfred A. Knopf

A “In the Mirro District” is. Peter
Taylor’s long awaited collection of
eight stories. The eight years that
elapsed between this book and
Taylor’s last novel, “A Woman of
Means,” were well spent—“Mirro
District” is an excellent, diverse
cross section of Taylor’s talent.

Each story has the richness of a
novel. Each selection deals with the
mysteries, the subtleties, of life.
While most of the stories take place
in Tennessee (speciﬁcally Nashville

and Memphis)—each has a stamp .

of uniqueness, a quality of its own.
A few are set up in a nonrhyming
poetic form, some are told in first
person, yet each is bound by the
southern setting and set apart by
plot;

The title story recounts the false
relationship between a boy and his
grandfather, leading to the . day
when they are desinted to have it
out, brutally and decisively.

“The Captain’s Son” is the story
of a strange young man and his
bride who move in with her parents
and are transformed into copies of
his alcoholic parents that they
strive to ignore. his is a
particularly suspenseful story,
leading up to a striking and
unsuspected climax.

“The Instruction of a Mistress,”

told in neo-poetic form gives two
views of an affair between an aging
famous poet and the woman he
mistakes to be an ignorant but
worshipful girl. He discusses her
education, how he molded her into
an intelligent attractive woman who
changed merely out of her adoration
for him. She (via letters to a lesbian
friend) reveals that her interest was
solely exploitive—-she had wanted
to check out his work before it was
printed.

“The Hand of Emmagene” is a
bizarre tale about a country girl who
visits relatives so she can meet
some nice Nashville boys. The title
is a dark humored pun on the
outcome of Emmagene”s romances.

“Daphne’s Lover” deals with a
man’s vicarious participation in his
best friend’s romances—-—an invol-
vement that both sustains and
contains him.

“Her Need” and “Three Her-
oines” both deal with mothers and
sons, but their plots and outcomes
are quite different. The former
deals with the rambling thoughts of
a divorced woman driving her
teenage son to his summer job. But
her apparent pleasure conceals a
dangerous ambivalence towards the
boy.

The latter is about a middle aged
man escorting his aged mother to
the Country Club for what he and
everyone else knows is her last
elegant evening. While both stories
are told in poetic stance, the
differences in maternal love are
striking and well drawn.

The final selection, “The
Throughway,” is the story of a
couple in their 60’s faced with the
prospect of a new highway that will
destroy the home they have lived in
since the beginning of their
marriage. During the crisis, they

Iggy/sldiot LackingLife  

By JIM FARERI
The Idiot
Iggy Pop
RCA

Iggy Pop has been a cult‘ hero

\since his “Iggy. and the Stooges”

band was formed in 1969. Iggy’s
fame rested on savage hard rock,
performed amidst startling feats of
masochism and audience-ex-
change.

After cutting a legendary LP
called “RAW POWER” in ’73, he
disappeared. Now, in close
association with pal David Bowie,
Iggy is staging a comeback.

Bowie worked with Iggy on “The
Idiot” at the same time and place as
his own “Low.” The LP is produced
and cowritten with Bowie, and
although we can’t be sure, the
mysterious “Iggy Pop and his
band’ ’ may be no other than Bowie,
Eno, and the whole “Low’T crew.
The music both ﬂaunts and
disguises this. ~

“The Idiot” is the aging punk’s
lament. It isn't the Iggy of four

‘years ago—any hopes of reﬁlling

the old shoes at 30 have been
abandoned.

Iggy drolls his irreverently low
monotone over the rhapsodic
pounding of the band’s machinery.
Everything here is synthesized,
muted, twisted—but never beyond
recognition. The music is stained
with distortion, not overcome by it.

The production, which involves a

their life together, its staleness and
emptiness.

Put together, this collection of
stories alternately shocks and
delights, amuses and terriﬁes.
Taylor’s technique of mixing
styles—-various forms of narration
and particularly, the poetic stance
are unique, interesting, and
fascinating.

“Mirro District” is a gripping
book, suspense-filled and spine-

happened, Jonah and the Hoenik-
kers plan to cremate the body, but it
accidently tumbles into the ocean
which freezes from the contact with
ice-nine.

Randy Kovitz is excellent as
Jonah, a believable everyman who
goes through Vonnegut’s chaos
with just the right attitude of
surprise, enthusiasm, and indigna-
tion.

J. Christopher O’Connor is a
delight in the dual role of Felix
Hoenikker and Monzano. Despite
thick accents for both characters,
O’Connor’s portrayals are light,
seemingly effortless, and hilarious-
ly well-paced. He shines in the
scene where the old doctor attempts
to amuse Newt by making a cat’s
cradle from a piece of string. Newt

’ later laments, “Grown-ups have

been doing that for years but there's
no damn cat and no damn cradle.”

There’s a sour note, however, in
Tawnya Pettiford’s portrayal of
Newt—she’s shrill and pushes too
hard, a sharp contrast to the
character in the‘ original novel and
O’Connor’s subtleness.

Jed Harris also overdoes it as the

probably his sax we hear too; some
of the guitar work is reminiscent of

Y,Bowie’s “Diamond Dogs” LP (on

which he played guitar) while other
licks on “The Idiot” ‘are distinc-
tively Carlos Alomar’s. Either Eno
or an Eno-schooled Bowie is all over
this album, dabbing the music with
nuances and surprises.

The best three cuts are “Fun-
time,” “China Girl,” and “Dum
Dum ‘Boys/’ “Funtime” is the
typical “Idiot” song, a heavy
irresolute hum-drum, in this case
rising to the climax of one of Iggy’s
marvellous screams. “China Girl”
is a perfectly structured number
mooded nicely with oriental piano
and heavy handed power chords. It
compares power-lusting western
man (Iggy-Bowie) with the yet
unscathed China Girl.

“Dum Dum Boys” is Iggy looking
back on his punk days: ‘ ‘Where are
you now my Dum Dum Boys  the

sniveling Frank. He’s too campy,
like an imitation Marx brother.
Fortunately, neither Pettiford nor
Harris is on stage that much to
detract from the whole of the
performance.

Susan Cash scores in a trio of
roles, most notably as Sandra, the
hooker Jonah picks up in an Illium,.
New York bar while doing research
on the Hoenikkers. In. fact, the
barroom scene with Randell Harnes
as a Brooklynese bartender and
William Tumer’s sleazily honky
tonk type music is one of “Cat’s
Cradle.”

The practice of interrupting the V

acting with signs bearing Bokon-
on’s terminology (such as wampet-
ers and granfalloons) with long
winded explanations becomes a bit

tedious, but the dialogue remains-

amusing and thought provoking.
Director Ken Kuta and Bruce
Jeremy Pribram skillfully adapted

A Cockburn Lights Up ” Darki”

By TOM WASELESKI

In the Falling Dark.
Bruce Cockburn.
Island Records, TL TN 9463.

So you've turned on the old FM
and you think you've heard some
strong new stuff by Gordon
lightfoot and Jesse Colin Young?

If you didn’t catch the song
credits, chances are you might
have heard a track or two from this
record.

Bruce Cockburn is a brilliant
guitarist, serving up one of the
bolder acoustic efforts of recent
years. He has a slightly reggae
folk style, with a tendency to get
French on the rhythm and lyrics
every once in a while.

The album's title track is a slowly
sinister acoustic piece reminiscent
of “Madman Across the Water”
minus the orchestration. Written
last September in Ottawa, the
lyrics give a taste of the somber
message found throughout this
concept album about Cockburn’s
Candian sojourn: “...slipping from
hand to hand. catching the light
and falling into dark, the world
fades out likes an overheard
remark in the falling dark...”

“Lord of the Starﬁelds" opens it
all up with perhaps the best vocal
and acoustic strum on the album.
Cockburn's voice is deep, extreme-
ly mellow, and becomes thin only at
the upper reaches of the scale. He
handles the lead‘ guitarwork him-

«,g,sel'f, leaving the bass to Michel

IV

D

Donato and percussion to Bill
Usher.

“Silver Wheels" speaks of
motion—interstate, ﬂatbed, fading
radio, lost on the highway motion.
Cockburn’s voice is a dead ringer
for Jesse Colin Young’s, but one
can ignore the imitation for music's
sake. Cockburn rolls along his
twelve-string like a 16-wheeler
passing a Greyhound, while Fred
Stone’s fluegelhorn taunts the
slogans in the lyrics that have

become catchwords in a society
that won't stay put.

There are several cuts where
Cockburn lets his guitar do all the
talking. “Giftbearer” is a hot,
suspenseful instrumental just
sweating with percussion and
torrid flute solos;
practically see. the heat waves
steam off the vinyl. “Water into
Wine" is a bit more on the classical
side, sort of a la Leo Kottke, but
uptempo and enjoyable just the
same. .

Cockburn has less luck with his

During the non-snow off season the U.S. Women’s Alpine Ski
Team members go on the “Ski Team” diet to lose 20 pounds in two
weeks. That's right - 20 pounds in 14 days! The basis of the diet is
chemical food action and was devised by a famous Colorado physician
especially for the ‘US. Ski Team. Normal energy is maintained (very
important!) while reducing. You keep “full” —- no starvation - V‘
. because the diet is designed that way. It's a diet that is easy to follow
whether you work, travel or stay at home. (Not the grapefruit diet!).

This is, honestly, a fantastically successful diet. If it weren’t, the
U.S. Women’s Ski Team wouldn't be permitted to use it! Right? So,
give yourself the same break the U.S. Ski Team gets. Lose weight the
scientiﬁc, proven way. Even if you've tried all the other diets, you owe
it to yourself to try the U.S. Women’s Ski Team Diet. That is, if you
really do want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks. Order today. Tear this

lays on the French lyrics,‘ over-
weighing any romantic effect he
may have been trying to achieve.
An unusually disarming tune is
“Little Seahorse,” which is dedi-
cated “to Jenny at eight weeks of
fetal life." The soft six-string and
flute tones highlight Cockburn’s
unique lines: “Little Seahorse,
swimming in a primal sea,
heartbeat like a leaf quaking in the
breeze. I feel magic as coyote in
the middle of the moon-wild
night..."

A Reading Associates believes that the popular
speed reading courses have been outrageously
overpriced for too long. THE PRINCIPLES
OF SPEED READING ARE EXTREMELY
SIMPLE, even the big speed reading com-
panies admit that. Yet, until now, learning to
speed read meant paying $100.00, $200.00, or
even more for a handful of short classes.

We’ve done something about it. After inten-
sive research and testing, Reading Associates
offers their revolutionary learn-at-home speed
reading course that will teach you to READ

FOUR TO FIVE TIMES FASTER WITH

THE SAME OR BETTER COMPREHEN-
SION.

The Manual of Speed Reading—A Com-
plete Speed Reading Course teaches the most
successful and popular known method of
speed reading instruction. Using this tested’ and
proven technique, people of all a es and from
all walks of life have changed their lives by
dramatically increasing their reading speed.

The Manual is a scientifically designed
course of exercises and instruction that will
double your reading speed in one week. After
one month, the average student will read four
to five times faster with the same OR BETTER
comprehension. That means instead of reading
200 words per minute, you will -read 1,000
words per minute. A one hour reading assign-
ment will take twelve minutes. All with the
same or better comprehension. The maximum
‘possible speed is. up to you. Exceptional speed
readers have attained speeds of up to 15,000
words per minute (about thirty pages in the
average book), although this is rare.

If you have thought about learning to speed
read before, but just couldn’t fit expensive
speed reading courses into your budget, now is
the time to act. The price of The Manual of
Speed Reading is only $7.50 (plus ’50c hand-
ling). That is the total cost. If you think $7.50
isn’t too much to pay for a skill that may
change your life, fill out the coupon below
and mail it to us today.

“Yes, I want to read four to five (or more)
times faster. I understand if I am not 100%
satisﬁed with The Manual of Speed Read-
ing, I may return it and my money will be
quickly refunded in full.”

 Varsity Tops Alums
But Everyone Wins

Ar .7 By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

They came back, some five dozen of them, to discover whether they
could still hit and be hit as they could in previous days of Panther
football, when they were undergraduates and the electric bill wasn’t as
formidable as was Notre Dame.

They heard their names» on the public address . system and, to a
smattering of applause ampliﬁed by memory, ran across a Pitt Stadium
ﬁeld that must have seemed a healthy ten yards wider than it had those
past autumns. . 7

The past three decades were well-represented by these graduated
Panthers; the oldest alumnus, John LaFrankie (linebacker, class of '50),
buoyed by one of the larger ovations, had crossed the entire width of the
ﬁeld before slowing to a walk. ’ V

  

7 . Jackie Sherrill’s idea for a spring practice ﬁnale—an alumni-varsity

game——was making Saturday afternoon a time for memories to be made

and retrieved. Everyone-p—fans, alums, coaches and varsity

players—had the opportunity to enjoy a good time Saturday. And not
just because no one was hurt.

For the estimated 7,500 fans who sat through four weather changes

” and four quarters of loose football. it was a great time. They cheered for

the alumni--a group of hand-clap-
ping, back-slapping enthusiasts

how much fun the game could
7 be——and appreciated the efforts of a _
varsity that didn’t make the
afternoon too tough for some of the
. older-timers.

Many of the returning players
were products of Pitt’s 1950s—.Dick
Dietrick, 240-pound “Tiny” Linn
and current linebacker coach
“Foge” Fazio, to namea few.

,1 More familiar to most fans were
the names from the ’60s. Paul
Martha, Rick Leeson, Jim Irwin and
All-Pro tight end Mike Ditka were

And there were quite a few
alumni who knew the burn of
Astroturf, a relatively recent
addition to the stadium, including
Bryant Salter, Dave Havern, Bill
Daniels, Dennis Moorhead, Glenn
Hyde, -Ernie Webster, Bobbi
Hutton, Rodney Clark, Stan Os-
trowski and Mike Bulino. V

Some thought the alumni would

killed these old Cats. ‘ ‘But after you \
got in there and made contract a few times,” said Martha, Pitt’s last
All-America before Tony Dorsett, ‘ ‘you found out it was still the same.”

‘ ‘After awhile, it got to where there wasn’t enough time to go around
for the people who wanted to play more,” said Dietrick, a gynecologist
who turned tight end, at one point for more than a dozen consecutive
plays. “But you still appreciated that breather.” _

The alumni had a reason to do some heavy breathing at

3 halftime——some decent play, a few breaks and some gracious ofﬁciating

led them to a 12-7 halftime lead. 
First, an onrushing surge of alumni defenders blocked a Woody

A Jackson/punt and sent it bounding into the end zone, where it was

corraled by Glenn Hyde, who then bounded both into the air and toward
‘his teammates, who joined him for a perfect rendition of “the thrill of
victory.” — '

Howard Heit, a ’66 grad who was a kicker and tackle in earlier years,
followed that score with a extra-point attempt that could have been
'equaled—-easily——by his daughter, if he had one. It was enough to
remind those present of the painful days before Carson Long came to
Pitt. 6' «

. After Larry Sims’ four-yard run put the varsity ahead, 1974 graduate

Bill Englert went in from a yard out to put the alums back on top, 12-7. A

however, making the halftime edge 12-7. H ”

Netters Chip Rock, 6-3

By JIM PANE

Pitt tennis coach George Dieffen-
bach-has a talent for understate-
ment. After yesterday’s 6-3 win
over Slippery Rock at’ Trees Courts
boosted his season record to an
impressive 4-0, he simply said.
"it's nice to be undefeated."

Dieffenbach apparently has an
added talent in coaching a team to
come back and beat the same
Slippery Rock squad that defeated
Pitt by an identical 6-3 margin last
year. i

The Panthers wasted little time in
turning the tables this season as
they took the first three singles
matches of the day and turned them
into a 3-0 Pitt lead. Tom Liebenguth
started things off with a 6-3, 6-4

Alumni All-Pro Dave Havern came out of the ’60s to return to his old quarter-
back position. Havern’s presence didn’t quite help the alumni as they fell to
the varsity, 28-12.

decision over Colin Levkanich and
Mike Habbel and Kevin Quay
followed by disposing their respec-
tive opponents, 6-2, 6-0 and 6-1,

The Rockets took the next two
matches but not without facing a
Panther struggle. Harry Habble
was the first Panther to go down to
defeat even though it took his
opponent, Mark Eckendorf, three
games to pull out a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4
victory.

Fred Pierce made it two in a row
for Slippery Rock by beating Tom
Gault, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, but Pitt’s Chuck

Brand won the sixth and ﬁnal‘

singles match, 6-2, 6-4', giving the
Panthers a 4-2 lead going into
doubles action.

Doubles play had given the
Panthers problems recently, but
Dieffenbach was “very pleased”
with the way the pair-ups went

against Slippery Rock.

Liebenguth and Mike Habbel
teamed up to defeat Levkanich and
Eckendorf, 6-1, 6-4, immediately
giving Pitt an unsurmountable 5-2
lead.

The Rockets salvaged the next

match but, not to be outdone, Quay
and John Girty closed out the
Panther victory in straight sets, 6-2,
6-3. ' A

The Panther coach displayed
mixed emotions after the victory,
though. He was happy about the
team’s performance but disap-
pointed by the lack of fan support
for his team.

‘ ‘I'm very proud to have our team
win 6-3, especially after losing by
thesame score last year at Slippery
Rock,” Dieffenbach said, “but the
players would play much better if
people would come to the mat-
ches.”

‘ -Tennis fans have only two more
chances to see the Panthers in
action this year—Wednesday after-
noon at 2 p.m. against Duquesne
and the home ﬁnale on May 2
against Robert Morris at 3:30 p.m.

NET NOTES: The Panthers beat
Carnegie-Mellongiand Robert Mor-
ris earlier this month and Akron last
Thursday, 5-4, to account for their
other three wins. They have 10
maftches remaining on their
schedule, including a 9 p.m. start
against WVU today.

MORGANTOWN—While every-
one at Pitt was preparing for finals
and graduation, Pitt’s track team
was performing double duty. The
Panthers, while losing sleep for
ﬁnals, were losing inches on their
jumps and gaining seconds on their
times.

Pitt appeared to be on the right
track this past weekend, at West
Virginia University’s Mountaineer
Relays.

“We showed definite improve-
ment,” Panther coach Mike Agos-
tinella said after the meet. “We
looked a lot better than our
performances against West Vir-
ginia last week and at the Nittany
Lion Relaysthe week before that.”

The Panthers not only lowered

their times at WVU but picked up‘

some awards to go with it. Pitt
captured one first-place, four

second-place and four third-places

tinishes. . p

two-mi1e"‘relay in a rainsoaked
7246.1.

Herrmann came back in the
spring medley relay to outkick a
fading East Carolina half-miler,
boosting Pitt into second-place.
Completing the relay in. 3:30.0 was
Bud Cooper running the quarter-
mile leg and Wayne Hursen and

Willie Walker sprinting the 220-

yard legs.

The longest relay of the day-the
four-mile relay—saw the Panthers
leading the ﬁrst 3-7/8 miles only to
be passed in the last 200 yards by
the meet’s most valuable runner,
Jim Villela of West Virginia.

Dattilo, anchoring for Pitt, just _

couldn't hold the lead built up by
Nort McDonald, Gary Siriano and
Mark Studnicki.

Boyd continued his dominance on i

the track circuit in the 10,000-meter
run. Boyd wasn’t quite able to run
down former All-American Alex

Kasich, now assistant track coach at '
.WVU who set a blazing early pace B

the hard WVU track, and it almost

former Pitt players from many eras
came back to face the challenge,
and none were disappointed.

Better still, none got hurt.

“I haven’t had this m_uch fun
since my wedding night,” said
quarterback Dave Havern, a 1971
graduate who is now an assistant
coach at Indiana of Pennsylvania.

Havern never enjoyed a winning

season at Pitt, so the 28-12 loss the 7 \

Alumni suffered against the varsity,
Saturday at Pitt Stadium, was not an
unfamiliar feeling to “White
Shoes,” as he was known.

going to ask Alex what he was doing
the first two miles-,. but I

7 remembered that he is a crazy
runner, so I didn’t bother.”
But even with the early fast pace

painfully familiar to veteran Pitt
watchers.

Havern will always be remem-
bered best for engineering Pitt’s
miraculous comeback victory over
West Virginia in 1970. Trailing 35-6
at halftime, Havern guided the
Panthers to four unanswered
touchdowns as they stunned the
Mountaineers, 36-35.

Another quarterback for the
alumni was Pittsburgh National
Bank employee Bill Daniels.
Daniels is better known around
Oakland as the quarterback who led
the first Pitt (Johnny Majors) squad
to the Fiesta Bowl in 1974.

“I was kinda scared,” said
Daniels, who completed all five of
his passes, two of them to the
opposition. “I didn’t know how to
react.”

Actually, Daniels and Havern
were quite impressive, and either
one could probably be second string
(behind Matt Cavanaugh) on the
varsity.

Also apparently good enough for
the varsity (according to no less an
authority than head coach Jackie
Sherrill), is Mike Ditka, class of
1961. The former All-Pro tight end
and current Dallas Cowboy defen-
sive coach looked formidable at
defensive end.

The game was played in a
humorous vein at times—-when the
officials (half of whom were late for
the start of the second half) allowed

. the alumni to ﬁeld 15 playersat a

time.

Varsity coaches John Gary and
Larry 0’Brien of WTAE-radio put in
a trick play that won’t be seen in a
regulation game.

The disc jockeys had the entire
Pitt line except for the center shift
away from the ball. Instead of
having the ball snapped to a
halfback who shifted with the line,
as in a properly executed play,
O'Brien and Gary ordered the ball
snapped to Cavanaugh. Cavanaugh
was stampeded instantly by the
alumni, with linebacker Foge Fazio
(class of 1959, current Pitt assistant
coach) leading the charge.

Cavanaugh lobbed the ball into
the waiting arms of Proctor &
Gamble salesman Dave Janasek,
who came up with thﬁ 635)’

interception.

“How about that?” he shrieked
after the game. “My first play ever
on defense at Pittsburgh and I got
an interception."

Janasek, who played linebacker
Saturday, was the I-formation

fullback whose excellent blocking
enabled Tony Dorsett to become the
first freshman ever to rush for 1,000
yards in a season. It was~in part
because Majors could not replace

‘Most run Since My Wedding Night’

name for hours.

Tackle Dave Blandino, a Fiesta
Bowl veteran, was typical of the
younger alumni in his preparation
for the game. The Pitt Medical
School student began running and
lifting weights several weeks prior
to the game. Though he gained 12
pounds in that time, Blandino
played at 25 pounds below his
230-pound playing weight.

One alumnus who isn’t in'pro
football and yet did no extra

preparation (or so he says) is mining
engineer Mike Bulino. Considered

one of the hardest hitters in Pitt if

history when he played monster
back from 1971-74, Bulino cracked,
“I’m always in great shape.”

The future of the game also
seems to be in great shape. as 7500
fans showed up for the -maiden
game on the soggy Saturday.

2 Panthers ﬁnished fourth

Page l8—THE PITT NEWS~—Tuesday, April26, 1977

Bright Spa ts Few For Duffers

By JOHNFINN

The Pitt golf team spent an
enjoyable; week on the golf
oourse—-or did they?

It is a fact that the Panthers spent

_ the last seven days on ﬁve different

golf courses, but it is doubtfulthat
they enjoyed anything except the
weather.

Pitt began its tour last Tuesday at
West Virginia University where the
in a
quadrangular match that, in
addition to the host team, included

Glenville and Miami of Ohio.

The only bright spots in the
Panthers initial loss were freshman
Jim McGrath from Penn Hills and
captain Bill Burkardt from Munhall,
both of whom shot 74. . _

In addition, Kevin McCarthy shot
a 77, Jim Fitzsimmons an 82 and
Alan English turned in an 86.

McGrath noted that the loss of
BobCoury had quite an affect on the
team. “He is a-ﬁne player,” said
McGrath, “and I am sure we would

have done better had he been
there.” Coury had returned home
for personal reasons.

The following day, the Panthers
faired slightly better. In another
quadrangular match that included
California, Duquesne and Robert
Morris, Pitt ﬁnished second.

McGrath and Burkardt turned the V

lowest Pitt scores again——each shot
77. -

Last Thursday, it was to the links
again for the third consecutive day.
In a triangular match with Slippery
Rock and Westminster, the Pan-
thers ﬁnished last. The match was
played at New Castle Country Club,
and this time it was English teaming
up with McGrath—to turn in Pitt’s
low‘ team score--Once again 77.
Meanwhile, Burkardt skyrocketed
to an 84 after being plagued with
viral ulcers that knocked him out of

2 action. He is not expected to return 0’
1 for sometime. The loss of Burkardt,
last year's MVP for Pitt, further

dampened any hopes for a victory.
After an off day on Friday, the

Panther traveled to Champion
Lakes Country Club for the Indiana
University of Pennsylvania Invita-
zional.

Even without Burkardt and
Coury, Pitt managed to finish sixth
nut of 12 teams‘. Young McGrath
zontinued his superior play as he
shot a 78 and ﬁnished fourth
individually in the tournament.

Elsewhere, McCarthy shot a 79,
Fitzsimmons and English an 87 and
Bob Elliot an 89. -

After Sunday, Pitt traveled to
West Virginia yesterday, this time
for the West Liberty Invitational.

Tliiswas the Panthers’ weakesf

performanceinthe last week. Only ‘S
Bruce "Stephen, who recently ’

became eligible scored well,
shooting an 82.

The tournament was played on
the Spiedel Golf Course where
many pro events are held.

“The wind and the tough course
really -made things difﬁcult for

-everybody,” said McGrath.

Despite this dismal past week, all
is not lost for the Panther golfers.
“We’re a young team and we're

going to be good in the future,”'
McGrath said. ‘ ‘But we could really
salvage the season if we do well at
the Penn State Invitational. That’s
the big one, and if we all play our
best and if Bill (Burkardt) recovers I
think we will do very well.”

almost broke Pitt’s record. His ﬁnal
time was 30:21, missing the record
by ten seconds. Panther distance
runner Bob Lee, back a ways behind
Boyd, ﬁnished third with a time of
31:50.

In the high jump, which was
badly effected by the rain, Pitt’s
Dan Goodyear was leading in the
competition until a jumper from
West Virginia Wesleyan cleared
6-10 (his best ever) to win. =

‘ ‘He pulled out his best jump ever '

and right before the rain started
again, ’ ’ Goodyear explained. ‘ ‘You
can forget about any good jumps
when the rain starts.” , 1

Goodyear wound up in second
place with a leap of 6’8”; while
Keith Taylor picked up third with a
jump of 6-6.

In the triple jump, Taylor
garnered another third with a hop,
skip and jump of 46-11.

Senior Dan Schuerle provided the
last third-place ﬁnish for the
Panthers in running the 120-yard
high hurdles in 14.4.

PANTHER TRACKS—Dan
Schuerle ran his last meet in a
Panther uniform—he will be off to
Michigan to complete his engineer-
ing studies. Also gone from the
track team are distance aces Terry
Wile and Ron Wirick. Wile is gone
due to commitments at home and
Wirick is studying in Mexico and
will be transferring to Hagerstown
Junior College in the fall.
Freshman shotputter Jim Munier
has also gone home to Hackensack,
New Jersey.

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP)——
The Minnesota Twins have lost
pitcher Mike Pazik for at least the
rest of the baseball season and relief
hurler Don Carrithers for about two
to three months after they were
seriously injured in a two-car
collision Monday.

Pazik, 27, a right-handed starter
who had a 1-0 record, suffered
fractures of both legs.

The 27-year-old Carrithers, who
had worked ﬁve innings and
allowed five runs, had a compound
fracture of his right kneee and a
fractured right wrist on his pitching
arm. He had no won-lost record
with the Twins, who purcased him
from the Montreal Expos near the
end of spring training.

Ah, the thrill of rip-
ping off someone elses
ad campaign.

Since we first said,
“Schmidts outscores Coors,’
a whole bunch of beers (who will remain
nameless) have challenged the canny con-
sumer to do his/ her own taste test. All of
which is cool, not to mention original. But.
Nobody seems to be stopping the presses
to get results out.

Well, here are our results, full dis-
closure fans.

Largely because a lot
 of people thought we
were crazy, we actually
got many letters and some
formal reports of blind taste
test ﬁndings. People being homo sapiens,
you'd think wed get letters like, “I did your
phoney test and I think you’re a disgrace
to free enterprise’

But. As far as we know, going against
every beer our skeptics could think of, we
