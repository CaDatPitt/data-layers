 

Changed R

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ
Staff News Editor

A registration survey taken by
the Academic Procedures Com-
mittee during the past SG elec-
tion indicates that University stu-
dents definitely approve of the
new procedures’ implemented by
the committee for the present
term. ‘

By a vote of 1,306 to 215, stu-
dents ‘approved the registration
method, ‘tried on,an experimen-
tal basis last term. Under this sys-

tem-, students carry an advisor-ap-’

proved tenative schedule to the
Registrar’s office. They are‘ in-
formed immediately, or within
two days, whether their schedule

has- been approved. Under the old _

system, students were informed
by mail, and often had to wait
several weeks for notification.-

Also approved, by a vote of 1,-
196 to 206, was registration by
class. Starting this fall, seniors
will register the first week, jun-
iors second, sophomore third, and
freshman last." The committee
feels that this system is not un-
fair because although un‘derclass-

,3, man will register last, they do not

compete with juniors and seniors
for space in most classes. Also,
upperclassman may need certain
classes to graduate.

At a special meeting, deans and
the registrar voted unanimously

V to implement the student-approv-

ed procedure permanently begin-
ning with registration for fall.

Also to be implemented will be
a reduction of transcript fee. Pre-
viously, a student paid one dollar
per transcript. In order to alle-
viate the financial burden placed
on graduate students who must
purchase many transcripts, the
price will now be one dollar for
the first transcript and 25 cents
for each additional transcript, if
they are all purchased at one
time. Students must provide ap-
propriate postage.

Speeches by outgoing President

Ken Schueler and incoming Pres— ,

ident Scott Baum headed the list
of ceremonies at the SG inaugura-
tion banquet Monday evening in
the Faculty Club.

Schueler recognized the efforts
of those students who aided him
in his term during the past year,
before‘ he gave a brief resume of
the change he experienced after
the NSA conference he attended
last summer.

Lenny Baxt, Joe Kociubes, Vic
Willem, Dianne Ulyon, and mem-
bers of the Allocations Commit-

tee were mentioned by Schueler‘
as committed, sincere workers,

without whom he could not have
headed such a successful Student
Government.

Schueler also announced that

‘Joanne Telerico was selected" by

her fellow senators as the Best
Senator of the Year.

In reading from his inaugural
address of last year, Schueler
pointed out that his ideas about
student representation did not
change in the past year, but that
as a result of the NSA conference.
he learned different ways to ex-
press those ideas.

Schueler drew a parallel be-
tween his own successful search
for an identity free of the securi-
ty that one finds in religion, fam-
-ily and society’s myths and ‘the

self-searching that students must V

g   Automation Moves Ahead   A _ g g
a City ‘Yellow Light’ Replacing ‘Red Raincoat’

Whatdoes he do in his spare time? “What spare
time? I get out there at 20 minutes before the hour
and stay till ten after. Then I run" up and stand in
the doorway of Clapp Hall /to try and get warm.’
The whole time I’m standing there I have to watch
in case someone in a wheelchair or .on crutches
tries to get across. You know, these drivers won’t
stop for anything.” As he said it, a student on
crutches appeared at the curb and Mentkowski left"
the ‘warm confines of the hall as he raced down to
the street to stop the cars.

This job 'isn’t as easy as it seems,” he went on.

As automation continually replaces men with
machines, Regis Mentkowski, a campus police of-
ficer, has lost his duty assignment. No, he didn’t
“goof-up” the job, but the long—awaited traffic,
lightsgat’ Fifth and Tennyson have "finally arrived.
Now, the familiar face and red raincoat are being
replaced by shining yellow lights that blink red,
amber, and green instead of blowing a whistle.

Early in the Fall term after many student pro-
tests, Chancellor Wesley Posvar requested a traffic
light be ‘installed at that intersection. When City
Hall didn’t act, the Chancellor fought back by
sending Officer Mentkowski to direct traffic at the
crossing between Clapp Hall‘and the Cathedral.
This was a temporary arrangement that began to
look permanent—at least -until last week when the
installation of the lights and poles was begun by

the city.

No longer will Mentkowski stand for nine hours
in the freezing cold and blasting winds. No longer
will be be soaked by the driving rain and snow.

undergo not only in the academic
community, but in society as well.

After taking the oath of office,
Baum talked about the challenge
_the new SG Senate must face. He
stressed the fact that each sena-
tor must divorce himself from his
other activities and devote full at-
tention to the Senate in order for
it to work as a constructive body.

Baum concluded his speech
with a quote from The Plague,
by Camus, which dealt with‘ the
fact that the bacteria which cause
the plague lie dormant in the hap-
py city long after the disease has
been cured.

“I hope we can continue to kill
the rats which carry the plague

bacteria in this University during‘

the n_e_x_t_ year,”Baum stated,

“and make it a ‘happy city’ for
the students.”

students can cross. A push-button traffic light will
take care of that. With one major difference.
Whereas the students had up to a minute to cross
under Mentkowski, they will have only 15 to 30

seconds with the lights.

Here’s what the friendly officer had to say
about it: “They’re gonna miss me. I’d get at least
50 compliments a day on my raincoat alone. Even
the bus drivers would signal me when they were
going to make a stop. I made a lot’ of friends out

In his monster role. Boris Karloff stood
for everything bad in mankind. As Frank-

Stop The Tax

 

’ by ALLAN SE 10
Contributing Columnist

' V If it were not for the Federal Income
Tax, America might not even be close to
falling under a Socialist-Dictatorship. The
monstrous federal income tax takes such
huge_sums from the people that state gov-
ernments have no adequate source of rev-

. All the people’s dol-
lars are down in Wash-

kissing contests to see
who will get the big-

 

“federal” money (peo-
ple’s money) from states who won’t dance
to the federal tune has been a most effec-
tive weapon againstour once strong sys-

_ tern of checks and balance.

THE AVERAGE US citizen has come
to view the Washington bureaucracy as
his Great Protector and Provider. The man
in the street has been led to think that gov-
ernment is responsible for our roads,
schools, and industry. What we fail to real-
ize at times is that government in and of
itself never produces anything.

It _can and does rob the productive cit-

I 1 . izens in order to buy the votes of the mass
 of lazy parasites, but government cannot

create wealth.

It can only give away that which is has
first stolen. It is a fact of life that those
who do accept federal “aid” end up fol-
lowing federal guidelines laid down by

  “some big whig in D.C.

- SOME’ PEOPLE FEEL that govern-

 ment must have lots of money in order to
‘ give us all the things we want. I warn

':these;.,fools that. any government whose

power is so extensive that it can give us
everything, can do anything at all to us.
When the income tax was adopted many
people felt that a little bit of Socialism
was OK, and that the “Big Businessmen”
could be brought down. —

This thinking illustrates human nature
at its lowest. When the government inter-
venes to tax to death the wealthy, it is at
the same time making it impossible for
the poor man ever to achieve wealth. An-
other fact is that big business and big gov-
ernment tend to be very chummy. The
really big boys put their millions into tax-
exempt foundations. while the middle and
lower classes pay most of the taxes.

That little bit of socialism was just
enough. We gave them the money and
what have they done with it? They have
used it to take-over our schools, they have
poured billions down the foreign aid sew-
er pipe, and worst of all much of the mon-
ey has been used to instigate and finance
a racial war in the United States. Through
such unconstitutional programs as OEO,
War on Poverty, and VISTA our govern-
ment has provoked racial antipathy to the
explosive point.

ONE PARTICULARLY deceptive fea-
ture of the income tax operation is the
“withholding” scheme. By this, employ-
ers are required to hold back a part of a
man’s pay from each pay check.

The worker sees a small amount with-
drawn for taxes each week. Thereby most
of the workman’s anger is displaced onto
his boss who is compelled to make the de-
ductions. If the government took the work-
er’s full last month’s pay, the real culprit
would be known.

American.’s should refuse to file their
returns this year. The evil would be stop— «
ped at the source.  , _ r «

The day’s light is fading. And the
twinkling dimness of Venus hangs in the
lower western sky. It is dusk now; the twi-
light of all existences.

The red ants and the black ants forget
their perpetual battle and return to their
underground homes. The ants, at this re-
flective time, have finished their daylight
burdens; the food has
been gathered.

Birds of all types fly
to their favorite tree
top perch, and close
one eye. All is peaceful
for them; their wing
muscles and feathers
are at rest. They rest in
order to start the same
routine the next day.

THE LIZARDS ARE getting out of

the hot beams of the desert sun. Their.

bodies are cooling‘ off. The lizard blood
and skin becomes cold. The next after-
noon, the temperature of the lizard blood
will rise. The routine has been going on
for ages.

The warm blooded carniverous mam-
els gather around a fresh carcus. The tall
grass blows gently, and the big cats chomp
on the raw meat. They sleep in large com-
munity circles. Their stomachs bulge with

sustenance.

The street lights have just been illum-

choke along the crowded, supérhighways.
These little machines filled with faceless
beings inch minute by minute from the
smog filled city to the clean air of su-
burbia. The car radios are playing fami-

IN THE CLEAR Venus dimmed sky,
wives without form slave over their kitch-

green beans, roast beef, lamb chops, and»

smell of boiling, baking, and broiling food

Female voices echo in the emptiness.
Mother calls child, and child skips home.
The young voices bubble with laughter
and‘ happiness. They are hungry. Young
bodies must be fed each day at dusk.

And students walk from afternoon

Contributing Editor

It’s good to know that the FBI is keep-
ing its over-vigilant eye turned to the uni-
versitites. J. Edgar Hoover seems to have
been born believing in some sort of sedi-
tious conspiracy and one wouldn’t want
him to change now. Indeed, I_Ioover’s, and
the FBI’s, paranoia merely‘ adds a little
spice to the noxious ,/I
guardianship of the stat— 
us quo currently popu- / //,1
lar in this country.

Reading between the  I
lines of the article on the " I

University senior-FBI ‘,I _

\ ..

7!" ‘I , ‘ '1
quisling, it seems likely /M/y  I .
that any student on this  * ’

   
 

campus who believes in
any political view left
of Nazism is dutifully followed by a
trench-coated government bird-dog. Which
is nothing new in this country.

HOWEVER, THE TREND is likely to
continue. Mr. Nixon’s plan for “law and
order” to date has taken the-form of more
ill-trained and badly paid white ‘police-
men for predominately black Washington.

Since during the Johnson administra-
tion blacks and students were the main
target of Federal and local suppression,
one can assume that coupled with more

cops will be more campus finks. Of course, ,

there is a point at which it becomes diffi-
cult to tell an informer from a movement
member. but by that time this country
should be quite solidly fascist. Or can’t
that happen here? (It can—it is. . . )

Colonel Drew’s current exploits are al-
ready old news but they deserve mention
here. The American Legion is in effect
saying to the University “If you don’t
teach how to kill, then you can’t teach
anything else.” — '

It is the contention of .a. greatnumber

‘ of people, however, that “if you do ‘teach

\
V .

 

how to kill, then you can’t teach anything
else.” But then those who believe in this
philosophy are probably the same ones
whose pictures are in FBI files. It would
seem in a sane society that life is to be
treasured, but in 1969 America the offi-
cial position is one of a lemming—down on
all fours groveling to the sea and suicide.

FROM SUCH AN almost-prone posi-
tion, it’s very easy to stick one’s head in
the sand. This, too, seems to be a common
American habit. Instead of attempting to
humanely reform society, current policy is
to make it even more rigid, rigid to the
point of atrophy. Blacks are oppressed in
the ghetto while their houses fall in on
their heads.

Students meet with apathy and equi-
vocation as administrators call in the po-
lice. Fortunately, at the University, at-
temps at reform are being made. but with
the recent letter from Dean Halliday un-
dercutting the Faculty’s decision to deny
ROTC credit, one can only wonder if
we’ve all been duped. This question be-
comes especially relevant in light of the
recent agreement signed with the Black
Action»_Society——will the University honor
its committments?

The student informer who “can’t even
buy a case of beer” with his bounty mon-
ey claims to be a patriot., it might be.more
useful to think of him as one of the warn-
ing signals of cancer.

 C1ear—Up ‘Hog’

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am the person David Rosen-
blum so vividly describes as a
“rather large hog or a rather
small elephant” in his column

of Jan. 27, 1969. /A candidate must’

expect criticism of his actions
during a campaign. If Mr. Rosen-
blum would have confined his
comments to my actions at the
debate in question, there would
be no need for this letter.

Instead, he chose to write a ma- I

licious and personal attack con-
cerning my appearance. This had
nothing to do with what I did. He
is guilty of the same thing he ac-
cuses the other senatorial can-
didate of doing: Judging a person
by his appearance. Beyond that.
he explicitly says that I support
the position of Senator Fleming.
This is ‘entirely false.

He never interviewed me, or
asked me my position. He made a

- statement on his own judgement

which in this case is false’. Mr.

»Rosenblum earlier this year used

this‘paper’s space to write a
satirical column concerning the
Black Power movement. He label-
ed his plan J.E.W.I.S.H. power.

So, you see, the sword cuts both 0

ways. I

The personal attack of Mr. R0—'
senblum is journalism at its low-
est level. The name calling and
personal slurs are : characteris-
tic of William Randolph Hearst‘s
“yellow sheets.” By printing this
type of attack. The Pitt News is al-
so guilty of the lowest type of
journalism that exists: cheap

- sensationalism and personal ‘at-

tack. This practice is an anathema
to good newspapers. To use edi-
torial license as a shield for this
type of hack journalism is an
abuse of that privilege.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to comment on
your article “Traumatic Exper-

appeared in The Pitt News on Wed-

port that the men in charge of
administering the physical have
changed their policies and atti-
tudes considerably since you
took the examination (if you did
take it). I experienced none of the
abuses sensationalized (as truly
they were) in your article. I have
no more desire than you to go into
the service, but why not be truth-

_ful.

Your “Letter Policy” mandates

Ullman Defends Cancellation

Editor, Pitt News:

As the person most directly
connected with all of the events
of Student Union Week and advis-
or to the Student Union Board, I
feel compelled to comment upon
the letter from Mr. Friedman
and Miss Ripp in the Jan. 29, issue
of the PITT NEWS. I would like to
know where they get their infor-
mation. Although I am aware that
Mr. Friedman is a member of the
Social Committee, the decisions
for the week as a whole were
made by the SUB Chairmen and
since neither Mr. Friedman nor
Miss Ripp attended any of these
meetings or discussed the sub-
ject with me, I can only assume
that their source is at best, sec-
ond hand.

Let me explain first the events
leading up to the ultimate cancel-
lation of the concert. It has al-
ways been the aim of the Student
Union Board to schedule the best
entertainment possible at the best
time and for the best price. In
deciding upon a Student Union
week as a concept, a risk was ac-
cepted in programming this type
of entertainment.

Once a single week or single
date is decided upon, one is not in
a position to ‘fshop around” for
talent as one would wish. The con-
cert that was finally decided upon
(Martha and the Vandellas and Jr.
Walker and the All Stars) was not
the Board’s first choice. r

It was, however, the only pro-
gram available for that date
which we felt would have any ap-
peal to the student body. The rea-
son there was so little publicity
in the beginning was that wehad
not received signed contracts
from both acts and could not
therefore publicize in good faith.
Jr. Walker did not back out but
simply forgot to return. his con-
tract to us which automatically
became void in 15 days. At this
point the Brooklyn Bridge was
decided upon as a substitute group
and Martha Reeves had returned
her contract signed. On the day
the Brooklyn Bridge contract
was expected, I was called and
told that they would not appear.

This was one week before the

concert, too late to book a third‘

group, and we were forced to con-
sider the possible success of the
concert with Martha alone. 1

At this point 400 tickets (not I

200) had been sold but all of these
under the impression that there
would be two groups. Thus, we had

to assume that some tickets
would be returned. Martha’s con-
tract called for a $4,000.00 pen-
alty for cancellation, and $1,000
for the Mosque. Both the.Board
and the Union Advisory Committee
felt that cancellation at this price
($5,000) would be too costly but
that holding a concert for the few
people we expected in a hall as
large as the Mosque would be just
as bad, and cost about as much.
Thus, when the agent offered to
‘reduce the penalty to 50% the
Union Advisory Committee ac-
cepted this and the contract was
canceled.

In closing, I would like to touch
on three other points. Mr. Fried-
man and Miss Ripp mention that
student opinion callsfor top name
groups (at top prices of course)
for which highe r» admission
should be charged, and that Sat-
urday night concerts are better
than week nights.

They were correct in their state-
ment that Wednesday night con-
certs are more inexpensive than
Saturday night concerts. Howev-
er, the Student Union Board is not
a speculative nor a profit-mak-
ing organization. Before we can
sign a contract for a concert we
must have the full ‘contract price
available in our budget. In other

-words, if a group is $10,000.00

and we have only $5,000.00 to
spend we cannot depend upon our
income for the proposed concert
to make up the other $5,000.00.
As our budget ‘now stands, if we

‘don’t have it all in the beginning

then we cannot have the act.

The Student Union Board does
not frown upon charging the Pitt
student for top entertainment to
a larger degree than has been
done in the past. We do feel, how-
ever, that once our budget has
permitted us to book an act that
we should charge as little as pos-
sible to the student. There is and
can be at present no relation what-
ever between admission price and
entertainment costs for the same
event.

I agree that it is a shame that
$2,000.00 has been spent with
nothing received in return but I
must also insist that at least
the fingernail of  of F. be re-
turned to Mr. Friedman and Miss
Ripp for accusations, the basis
for which they do not understand.

are undisciplined. Then, nur-
tured on the present, they-come
to a college that requires written
expression, memorization and a
foundation in the past. Their frus-
tration grows and seeks an outlet,
which is usually a drive for more
“relevant” studies which threat-
en to be so narrowly contempor-
ary as to produce an anti-histor-
ical and even anti—intellectual
trend.

Then there are those who view
student restlessness in a wider
context of the social protest of the
1960’s which is supposedly taking
the form of “The ‘Equality Rev-
olution” (The New York Times
Magazine, Nov. 3, 1968). Within
this “revolution,” the students

taking a more orderly course. At
least one observer of this year’s
events, lumping them all togeth-
er, calls 1969 “The Year That
Failed to Turn (New York Times,
Dec. 30, 1968) and compares it
to 1848.

The parallels are striking. Now.
as then, a certain hardening and
sobering up is taking place. This
inclues the academia. At Colum-
bia, which was the headliner of
1968, the acting president, Dr.
Cordier, has made,it clear to rad-
ical students that he is prepared
to listento proposals for changes
at the university but not to de-
mands. Meanwhile, several stu-
dents are suing Columbia Univer-
sity’s Board of Trustees for fail-
ure to maintain “a state of tran-
quility” last spring. At City Col-
lege of New York, traditional base
for student militants, radical stu-
dents are losing ground (New
York Times, Dec. 15, 1968). They
have alienated a large body of
students, politically near them,
who don’t go for confrontation

Wilkins, a moderate civil rights
leader, voiced strong opposition
to demands by Negro students for
all-black studies departments on
college campuses (New York
Times, Jan. 14, 1969). And an
opinion survey of this year’s fresh-
man class of 435 colleges and uni-
versities disclosed that more than
half of the students believe that
“most college officials have been
too lax in dealing with student
protests on campuses” (New York
Times, Dec. 22, 1968).

The protesters themselves have
been lampooned by Professor
Searle, former faculty leader of
the Free Speech Movement of
1964 at Berkeley," in an amusing
article, “A Foolproof Scenario for
Student Revolts (The New York
Times Magazine, Dec. 29. 1968).
While making fun of the methods
used by students in presenting
their grievances, he nevertheless
correctly points out that the issue,
in America, is always related to
race and Vietnam. In this, h_e is

POLITICS PERVADES ISSUES

Fred M. Hechinger, an ex-
tremely well informed writer of
the New York Times editorial
staff, in his perceptive Annual
Education Review of Jan. 9. 1969,
goes even further and states that
“the great issues in American ed-
ucation last year were not aca-
demic but political.” This is un-
fortunate, but inevitable, and it
explains why the only recent aca-
demic disruptions are those
which have either racial (San
Francisco, Brown, Brandeis,
Queens, etc.) or military over-
tones (Harvard RTOC). It testi-
fies to the inability of today’s uni-
versities to escape current issues.

Sidney,Hook, the philosopher;
told his fellow-scholars at a meet-
ing of the Modern Lanuage As-
sociation in New York that “we
cannot and should not escape the
world of politics” (New York
Times, Dec. 29, 1968). But he in-
sisted, probably as a reaction to
the radical agitation among the
younger faculty at the MLA con-
vention, that “in a rational and
humane society there must be
some activities and institutions
that are beyond politics.”

In America, universitites can
become such institutions again
when the current issues are ei-
ther solved or on their way to be
solved. Then, and only then can
the universitites move beyond po-
litics and go about legitimate aca-
demic reforms without being pres-
sured into them.

Coming back to our university,
how does Pittsburgh fit into these
patterns? (A possible follow-up.)

Biafran Crisis Discussed B

The Council for International
Relations and United Nations Af-
fairs (CIRUNA) made an attempt
to clear up some of the misunder-
standing clouding the recent Biaf-
ran crisis in a forum held Sunday
from 7:30 — 10:30 in the SU Ball-
room.

The format was a question and
answer session between a panel
consisting of three representa-
tives of the Biafran Student Asso-
ciation, and three Nigerian stu-
dents and an audience of 70.

It was brought out that the

base cause for the Biafran strug-
gle to secede from Nigeria, lies
in tribal hatred and jealousy. The
Biafran section of the nation con-
sists of a mixed population, 60%
of which are Ibos, a native tribe.

The solution offered by the Ni-
gerian Federation, that the ar-
rangement of a cease fire follow
a renounciation of the secession,
was rejected by the Biafrans.
The latter insisted t_hat their in-
dependence be recognized be-
fore negotiations should begin.

It came across to the audience

3that perhaps the only solution
remains a military one.

On the whole the CIRUNA forum
succeeded in throwing some light
on both sides of a darkening cri-
sis for the Nigerians and allevi-
ated the confusion born of con-
flicting reports from biased
sources.

An Underm'ning of Belief

»

By BRUCE LEY
Staff News Writer

A question was raised as to
whether Campina thought the
Communists could triumph in the
United States, and how. The lec-
turer replied that “If Commu-
nism succeeds in the United
States, it will be subtle, an un-
dermining of belief. It will take
advantage of apathy.”

One individual, claiming to
have “just made an intensive
study” of the current medical

situation in Cuba, argued with

Campina that the present regime
makes better provision for medi-
cal care of the people than any
previous rule. The dialogue would
have been a stalemate, except
that a young lady of Cuban na-
tionality joined the argument to
insist that while she had lived
“in a little, dinky town,” she

had always had quick access to"

proper medical care. She allow-
ed that some of the mountain-
dwelling people were unfortun-

ate in this respect, that we should

remember that “the area of Cuba,

as a nation is less than that of
Pennsylvania. To get to a hospi-
tal in another province, one should
think in terms of getting from
Oakland to Bethel Park.’-’ She also
pointed out that “We have more
schools under Castro. true; but
sixth—grade students are teach-
ing.” She said that her own fam-
ily had been deeply divided by
this ideology conflict.

At this point the challenging
individual explained that he had

not expected anyone to “be for

Castro” because of his own stand.
Campina smiled ruefully and re-
plied, “As the young lady said.’
‘we are neutrals and where are
we now? We ‘never thought we
would leave Cuba.’ ”

Campina sketched some de-

tails of the Bay of Pigs invasion,
from which he "and 25 other men
escaped in the only uncaptured
war-surplus Landing Ship Tank.

“We spent 20 days at sea.” A,

murmur went around the room.
Campina laughed softly. “Don’t
let anybody kid you about things
like that. They tell you in a situ-
ation like that you will eat a
‘crap.’ I ate a crap and it tasted
wonderful.”

The lecture was cut short when
someone interrupted to announce
that Campina had a plane to catch.
This reporter accompanied Cam-
pina on his ride to theairport,
which had been offered by Jim
Mavrey of Students for Conserva-
tive Action, who had sponsored
the lecture. En route Campina re-
lated that he thought Castro’s
logical successor would be his
brother, Raul.

Campina (who made it in time,

by the way) had ended histalk ..

Future of Cuban Communism Argued

 

on an ironic and compelling note:
asked if he thought that another
invasion or revolution was pos-
sible, he had nodded affirma-
tively, expressed the belief that
it would probably happen “from
within, by assassination or other
violent means,” and remarked:

“Everybody wants to go to
Castro_’s funeral. Nobody wants to
go to his own.” -

‘Beyond the Law’:

Realistic,

“A realistic, powerful rend-
ering of the police milieu” is how,
Variety described Norman Mail-
er’s second feature length film.
Beyond the‘ Law. University stu-
dents will be able to see the Pitts-
burgh premiere of this film Feb.
6 and 7 in the SU Ballroom. The
film will be screened three

times each day at 6:30 p.m., 8:30
p.m., and 10:30 p.m. but will run
only these two days in the city.

The event is being sponsor-

Powerful

ed by the University’s Depart-
ment of Educational Communi-
cations and Cinema Pittsburgh, a
group of local film-makers. All
proceeds from the $1.50 admission
fee will -be used for the establish-
ment of a workshop fund under
Cinema Pittsburgh.

The film Beyond the Law is‘ a
realistic study of the policeman

and his world. It depicts a night.

at a Manhattan police station
and goes on to detail how three

of the detectives spend the re-
maining evening hours
their work is completed.

The film presents a large gal-
lery of character portraits. It
is a series of confrontations with
murderers, gamblers, perverts
and prostitutes. These characters
are brought to life by such pro-

fessionals as Rip Tom and Nor- .

man Mailer and such newcomers
as George Plimpton.

One of the most interesting

features of Beyond the Law is.

that it is a film without a script.
The script was improvised with
Mailer describing the basic "situa-

tion to his actors and with dialogue ,

and story details coming from
the actors themselves. The re-
sult is a sort of psychodrama
with the appearance of a discip-
lined structure.

' , by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
After battling Pistol Pete Maravich

e_ Carnegie-Mellon University Tar-
tans offer the eagers a retreat tonight

 Page 103-TIIE PITT NEWS4Wednesday, February 5, 1969

_ their traditional exhibitions against the

cagers, they may be the victims of disaster.
The hoopsters are a battered team looking
for the punching bag that will put them on
that unfound road of winning basketball.

In the past, Carnegie-Mellon has play-
ed the role of the punching bag for eager
fives. In fact, since 1907, when the ri-
valry between the two clubs began, the
eagers have compiled a, 99-16, mark against
their Tartan foes. What is more, the eagers
have won the last 26 games consecutively.

But basketball coach Buzz Ridl refuses
to take tonight’s contest lightly. After all,
his squad owns a dismal, 3-13 mark, a pace
that falls short of the last four losing sea-
sons.

“We can’t take them" lightly,” said
Ridl. “They will be up for this game and
they” be coming at us. If we take them
lightly, we’ll be in trouble.”

The Tartans are off to a slow start this
season. In his third year as head coach,
Moe Fassinger" has watched his team’ drop
eight of ten games. But the Pittsburgh na-
tive will be looking to another Pittsburgh
bred hoopster for help.

Senior Mark Lang, ‘one of the district's
finest players, will be a eager nemisis to-

night. Lang, who had scored 970 points in

his varsity career before this season, is
well on his way to becoming the second
leading scorer in Tartan history.

Last year, Lang was a key Tartan
roundballer in the eagers’ final game. The
Tartans walked off with an 85-74 defeat, but
troubled the eagers enough to rack up a
moral victory.

Along with the 6-5 ex-South Catholic
star. ‘the Tartans have Juniors Bob Graz-
zini (6-6), Bill Abraham (6-4). and Bill

Weborg (6-4) playing underneath. Abra- »

ham’s progress as a Tartan late last season
also makes Fassinger optimistic.

CMU also has four returning guards
from last year’s squad. Heading the list is
John Meister, who placed second on the
team in scoring behind Lang. -

Meister will team with either Sno
Mitchell, Dave Stobbe, or Leigh DeHuff
in the baekeourt. None of the guards are

scoring threats. In fact, Meister’s 6.1 aver- . l A

age was high among the backeourtmen last
year.

On the other hand, "Ridl has found an ef— 

ficient outside scoring combination in re-

cent games. Sophomore Mike Caldwell and 

junior Bob Petrini have been hitting for
double figures often. Petrini’s high was his
25 points against Louisiana State; Caldwell
hit for 25 against WVU and 20 against
Tulane.

“Petrini’s done a fine job,” said Ridl’

after the eagers returned from the South.

“He shot 11-14 against LSU. Maravich had .

40 points but shot only 13-34. So he had
a good showing for himself.”

Ridl will probably start the remainder
of his usual ‘starting five —— Jerry Causer,
Rob McFarland, and Mike Pateher — but
if things work out as in the last 15 years,
the eager subs will get much needed work.

Particularly slated to see more action
is sophomore forward-guard Tom Withers,
an Indiana-bred recruit. Withers saw his
most action during the Southern tour when

the eagers were in desperate need of all
the available help.

Tonight the hoopstes will try to’ change
the situation, play the role of the bully,

and win their second straight home con-
test.

early in the second period and then
rode out Sonntag for the entire
third period to win. Sonntag has
been billed by the Maryland pub-
licists as “the best heavyweight in
the East."

“Ralph did a great job,” quip-
ped Adams. “The whole team did.
We were aggressive and better on

Cubs Host CMU I V’ s,

d Hope for Zone Practice

by BILL NAAB

Tonight the Panther basketball Cubs oppose the Carnegie-
Mellon JV team at the Field House in a 6:15 start. The.Cubs
have won four while losing three. The losses came against
undefeated Robert Morris Junior College, University of Pitts-
burgh at J ohnstown, and Duquesne.

Meanwhile, Carnegie-Mellon
has won just one of six contests.
The Little Tartans have lost to the
Art Institute of Pittsburgh twice,
but have beaten Allegheny Com-
munity College (North Side).

Besides an obvious advantage in
talent, the Cubs should have a
distinct height advantage. The
probable starting lineup for the

Tartans is, 6’5” Frank Sacco-for- .

ward, 6’5” Frank Westmeyer-cen-
ter, 6’3” Mike Canrot, forward.
6’0”. Ed Aulguard, and 6’1” Tony
Wright-guard. ‘

Wright hails from Sto-Rox
High School and is a friend of the
former Canevin star and present
Cub guard Bob Cizmarik. Wright
remarked, “Cizmarik’s a pretty
good ballplayer. A couple of our
guys have seen your freshmen and
are pretty impressed with the
squadf’

The Tartans have no special
plans to test the Cubs, but will
stick to their regular style. The
Carnegie-Mellon offense is some-

I what similar to that of the Cubs.

They try to work for the good
shots and do very little freelanc-
mg.

Moreover, the Tartan defense
will be basically man to man.
They have spent a considerable
amoutn of time practicing a zone
defense, but Wright mentioned
they they have used it infrequent-
ly thus far. It might be best for
the Cubs if the Tartans would set
up the zone defense.

In the loss to Duquesne last
Thursday, the Cubs were com-
pletely thwarted by the Dukes’
second half zone. In the first half,
the Cubs held a three point lead
against the man to man defense.
And after the 17 point loss, assis-
tant coachVJim Monroe stated the
Cubs would have to get more ex-

" L perience against the zone in order.

to defeat the Little Dukes in
their rematch, February 14.

However, the Cubs feel that
they would be better prepared
this time if the Tartans threw the
zone at them. The squad went
over their mistakes in practice and
believe that they know exactly
what went wrong.

Cub guard Kent Scott remark-
ed, “There was confusion when
Duquesne came up with the zone.
Maybe we should have called
timeout and went over things.”

The Cubs’ regular coach, Tim
Grgurich, will be back tonight
and is expected to fire his squad
up just in case they aren’t already
up for the lowly Tartans.

Skip 0rszulak’s days of an-
onymity may soon be over. The
speedy flanker was drafted by
the American Football League
San Diego Chargers last Tues-
day in the pro football draft, and
the record-breaking receiver may
be ready to follow Eric Crab-
tree’s lead in the AFL.

Crabtree graduated when Skip
was a freshman and is now one
of the leading pass receivers in
the AFL, hauling them in for
the Denver Broncos.

Orszulak was selected by the
Chargers on the fifth round and
was mildly surprised.

“I thought Atlanta or Minneso-
ta would be the one to take me,”
confided Orszulak, “but I’m
glad I’m going where it’s warm.

San Diego, besides having one
of the AFL’s leading passers in
John Hadl, also has one of the
premier flankers of the league in
Lance Alworth. And the split end,
Walt Garrison, is no slouch
either.

“They've got Alworth and Gar-
rison,” figured Orszulak, “but no
backup men .tha_t are any good
that I know of. They’re in real
need of receivers. Besides, Al-
worth is getting old and he’s been
getting a lot of injuries.”

It was the same confident Skip
Orszulak talking that backed up
his sounding-off during the sea-
son by catching 50 passes for a
new school single-season record.

. “You always want to go high in
the draft,” commented_Orszulak,
“at least in the first six rounds.
I was thinking, ‘My God, I might
not even go.’ When I stop and
think about some of the boys
that went ahead of me, it makes
me wonder.”

Part of the reason that Skip
may not have gone earlier is that
San Diego had some of his sta-
tistics mixed up. For example,
the Chargers had him listed for
a 4.7 40-yd dash; he does a 4.4.

While Orszulak sat in his room
all day awaiting a call with some
friends, a teammate tried keep-

ing him loose with several crank
calls, such as one from the Green

Bay Bombers, a non-existent team-

“I could tell it was Eddie Gallin
calling,” revealed Orszulak. “You
could tell it was him even if he
had an apple in his mouth.”

Eventually the real call came
through, though, from Sid Gill-
man of the Chargers, who told
Orszulak he was pleased to have
him. Now Skip will concentrate
on learning the Chargers’ sys-
tem, work out with the track
team, and follow a lift and run
program for getting into shape.

“Rookie camp starts the fif-
teenth of July, with free agents
reporting a week before,” related
Orszulak. “I plan on going early
so I can get a good jump. I’ll see
if I can work - out this summer
with Marty Dombres, (Columbia
quarterback drafted in the first
round by the Chargers ) .”

Although he was selected quite
some time ago, the Pitt News is
happy to pass along the selection
of Ken Snyder as varsity baseball
captain for the coming season.

Incidentally, the mitters are cur-
rently working out daily in Trees

Monday when he na_med 40-year
old Tom Fletcher. a former

- Steeler assistant. Fletcher joins

Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi as De-
Pasqua’s two top assistants.

Fletcher brings a broad back-
ground of football experience to
the job. After finishing his col-
lege career at Arizona State as an
All-Conference defensive half-
back in 1954, Fletcher passed up
a chance at the pros because of a
knee injury and became an as-
sistant at ASU. He remained there
until 1957.

That year Dan Devine. left Ari-
zona State for Missouri, and he
took Fletcher with him. Coach-
ing at Missouri from 1958-65,
Fletcher handled both the of-
fensive backfields at various
times. During those eight years,
Missouri went to four bowls.

Then in 1966, when Bill Aus-
tin took «over the Steeler head
‘coach, Fletcher was invited to
join the Pittsburgh staff. This
past year he worked together with

DePasqua, who was the Steeler de-

fensive line coach. .

Meanwhile, Dave Hart’s old
staff continues to find good job
offers. Bill Neal,who was Hart’s
top aide, recently signed to co-
coach Indiana State (Pa.) with
Chuck Klausing next year and
assume total control the follow-
ing season.

Defensive backfield coach Bill
Lewis went to Cal Stoll at Wake
Forest while Hart’s defensive co-
ordinator Dan Sekanovich just
joined the new staff at Navy. Of-
fensive line coach under Hart,
Howard Weyers, takes over as
offensive co-ordinator at Miami
of Ohio. ’ «
