I That seasonal epidemic, Yule-
tide spirit, has attacked the Uni-
versity.
The symptoms are a rash of
«Christmas parties and Christmas
-carol melodies.
The ﬁnal and almost certain
cure is attendance at the Com-
,mon’s Room Christmas party
Tuesday at 3 p.m. This prescrip-
tion, recommended by Common’s
,,Room Council which sponsors the
party annually, is advised for the
whole student body and faculty.
One of the more traditional fig-
ures usually present at the party

State Budget
Appropriation
Still Up In Air

The state legislature today had
not yet acted on an expected Pitt
budget appropriation of about
$2,500,000.

A tentative statewide budget
submitted» to the legislators by
Governor S. Fine called for that
amount to go to the University.

Last Thursday a Senate Repub-

lican caucus agreed-‘to lop $1,5-00,- '

0-00 off the tentative Penn State
budget of $17,500,000. ‘ ‘
The Penn State reduction, how-
ever, is not yet ﬁnal. '
University authorities here at
Pitt were unavailable for com-
ment as to whether the Pitt budget
might also be lowered. s

Bob Gardner moved that a committee made up of con-
fgressmen should investigate the problem. He said it was

out if there is discrimination on

campus. Gardner said he felt that

there is some discrimination here,
but it is not a pressing problem.

_ In discussion of the motion,
Jack Burwinkle, Men’s Council
president, said, “It seems that
the problem of prejudice is
brought up by The Pitt News

. every year around this time. I
don’t think there is any dis-
crimination. However, if some-
one can show me that there is,
I will be willing to accept their

appointed to the investigating com-

University debaters tied for ﬁrst
place last Saturday with the Car-
negie Tech debating team in the
Fourth Annual Pitt Cross—Exarn-

gram of wage and price controls."
Members of the aﬂirmative team
were Lud Lippert and Dan Purdy.

‘excellent ratings.”

Debate teams from 40 high
schools in western Pennsylvania
gather here tomorrow for the 14th

Sponsored by the Pitt Men’s
Debating Association, the tourna-
ment-clinic gives orators from

experienced men.

Bill McKinley, debate public-
ity chairman, said about 300 de-
baters and coaches are expected
to attend the tournament.

Each entry has been limited to
two four-man teams and each has
been requested to furnish one
judge for the tournament.

Prepared by Franklin Black-
stone, director of Men’s Debating
Association, and Ludwig Lippert,
audience manager; the all-day
program begins at 9 a.m. with reg-
istration in the Stephen Foster
Memorial.

The two rounds of debate will
start at 1 p.m. At 4 p.m. the re-
sults of the two rounds will be
announced in the headquarters
room. _

Decisions will be rendered by
judges supplied by the high
schools and the University.

Peterson Doffs Santa
Outfit After 10 Years

By JOAN LISOTTO

Pitt’s traditional Santa Claus
has forfeited the reins of his
sleigh.

He’s turned in his beard and
handed over his worn crimson
costume to someone new. After a
decade as St. Nick, Edwin L. Pe-
terson, professor of English, will

year’s Common Room Christmas
Party. ' A
It was in 1941 that Prof. Pe-
terson ﬁrst played the role of
Santa. And today it is that
Christmas party which remains
the most memorable to him.
It wasn’t a very happy yule-

tide season. The Japanese had
bombed Pearl Harbor ‘only a few
weeks before. The Cathedral was
bustling with soldier-students
who were bunking in renovated
class rooms above the Commons
Room. There were very few
men at Pitt that year, other than
those in uniform. But it was
Christmas and the holiday had
to be maintained despite the war.

GI’s Hear Festivities

The Commons Room was
adorned with traditional, fes-
tive rainment. Evergreen
branches branches bent low un-
der their colorful burden of
lights and ornaments, and the
ﬁrelight threw ﬂickering shadows
into the corners. _ Wreaths and
holly clasped the gray pillars.

The professor had distributed
his gifts and the carolers_raised
their voices. Suddenly someone
began singing “Keep the Home
Fires Burning,” and the audi-
ence, catching the mood, joined
in. The song rose high in the
Commons Room.

Ranks Broken

Doors on the ﬂoors above ﬂew
open and soon the balconies were
jammed with‘servicemen disre-
garding orders to stay in their
rooms. Their voices swelled the
chorus from below and many of
them sang from their hearts for
they were a long, long way from
home.

Below, the students stood
watching, their eyes raised, their
faces covered with tears. It was
truly a magic moment. And on
the platform stood a man with an
empty sack and a-bowed head. It
was Christmas but Santa was
weeping too.

Shiny balls on evergreens,
carolers on Christmas Eve,

I‘ rich fruit-cakes, and mistle-
'toe are old established tradi-
tions for most Pitt students.

To many members of the
University’s ‘International
Club, however, the mention of
Christmas brings memories of cus-
toms quite diﬁerent from ours.

Yusseff Ibrahim, president of the
club and ‘a native of India, recalls
the Indian custom of placing part
of the Christmas feast in the cor-
ner to chase devils away.

A Lighter Side

 There is, of course, a lighter side 4

to Christmas in India. The curly-

f haired Ibrahim noted that the peo-
' ple there also hang" stockings.

“But,” he added, “if your stocking
has a hole in it, you’ll get only

needle and thread.”

Petite blond Violet Petkevicius
points out that, in Lithuania, the
Christmas Eve feast is the most
important tradition. ,

Upon a cloth-covered pile of
straw in the center of the table,
holy wafers, and many different
foods are placed. A

The family places food under
the table to feed the returning
souls of deceased relatives.

No Christmas Gifts

In many countries gifts are not
exchanged on Christmas Day.
Spanish people, according to Philip
Gonzalez, give gifts on Jan. 6.

“Merrie Olde England” has a
holiday the day after Christmas,
also. On that day, “You just re-
cover,” says Englishman Joseph
Levy.

The hale and hearty Swedes trek
out Dec. 24, and chop down a
Christmas tree. Then, on Christ-
mas morning, says Eivor Eeg-
Clofsson, the oldest daughter rises
at 5 a.m., dons a white robe, and

make up the holiday meal.

Christmas is not a particularly
holy day. “But on New Years,”
Kiroo Mukai hastened to add, “the
celebration lasts three days.” Rice
cakes and rice wine are the re-
freshments for this holiday.‘

The Internationals don’t feel
particularly unhappy about spend-
ing Christmas away from their na-
tive lands. _As club president
Ibrahim says, “No matter how you
celebrate it, in any country, it’:
still Christmas.”

gone the same way as the Du-

The ill-fated MOONSHINE
reached the stands Nov. 9
bulging with pure “locker

the campus had the students
howling, but the faculty was
singing a different tune. Espe-
cially a Dr. Patrick Gainer,
faculty . advisor to the maga-
zine. .

Seems that Dr. Gainer, a
family man, deleted quite a.
few of the more vulgar jokes.
But the staff restored all the

had been stricken.

Did Garcia Really Care
About Getting That Message?

This is the sad story of
a senior who was Seri-
ous about a Girl. In
the straightforward
manner of seniors, he
invited her up for the
Big Weekend.

He sat down and wrote her a nice letter
1 month ahead. Then he sat back and
waited. And got no answer in three weeks.
F inslly, in desperation, he phoned Her.

(bet him $4.25 in quarters. When the
banging of the Coin Box stopped, all he
could hear at the other and of the wire
was 1 stutter of Snilis. “Honey?” he
asked. She sobbed more plainly.

“Harold,” she veiled, “You used to send

telegrams to invite me to Big Weekends

,—-'l'hisyur,allIget is nlittle o1dLetter.
You don’t love me.” And hung up.

Herold goes everywhere stag now. Says
he prefers it that way. But when he passes’
I Western Union oﬂice, he sighs.

A telegram takes any message right out
of the casual class. It’: subtle-—-it ﬂutters
the person who gets it. Next time you
send an invitation, or a bowl home for
cash or s birthday greeting to Mother-
inot all Western Union or head for your

. The Student Congress committee now investigating dis-
« crimination should unearth some interesting and authorita-

tive information about that recurring problem. They should
come up with a fairly accurate estimate of the size of the

ﬁre which annually sends up so much smoke.

They must enter their study with open and inquiring

minds, determined to seek out the ugly spectre of. prejudice
. ‘wherever it exists. If any of the nine men hold precon-
ceptions about the prevalence or seriousness of the prob-
lem, they should-hold them in abeyance during their study.

Justification for discriminating against a man on the basis
. of_ his ‘race, creed or national aiﬁliation. We are all humans,
alike in the eyes of our God and similar inour beliefs and
aspirations. _It IS immoral as well as undemocratic to penal-
,1_Z‘e a minority merely because that group is different in
some physical or philosophical manner from the majority.
This is especially signiﬁcant as We approach the cele-
bijation of the birth of a man who preached that all men
. are brothers. We shall watch thiscommittee with’ inter-
; est and await its report with eagerness.

One Blueprint » (Io wn

The. ﬁrst blueprint in the University’_s Building Pro-
gram‘ will be tossed into the ash can tomorrow night when
the new Field House is dedicated. What we see on the Hill
will be the culmination of many years of planning and ne-
gotiating. and an example of what persistence and faith
can achieve. |
_ The sleek new building should provide a stimulating
incentive for our future athletic teams. It offers them ec-
. cellent and almost luxurious facilities for training. If they
.can equal the spirit of the men who put the building there,
they will certainly bring honor to the University.

Intramural sports should ﬁnd the facilities available
for their use more than adequate. And at long last the
physical education program of Captain Hamilton will no
in longer be restricted by our physical plant.

, The Memorial Field House is a symbol of the Uni-
versity s renewed interest in the ﬁeld of_athletics. It augers
of good things to come.‘

Overt Ia parte

, A freshman, last week. found out that ‘he must be a
,member of Men s Council in order to attend its meetings.
He was denied admission on the basis of a section in the
Council» constitution. A

Men's Council is an elective body, responsible to the
students who passed on the membership at the polls last
spring. As such there is no reason why they should conduct
a their meetings behind closed doors. ”‘
At their next meeting the members of Council should
«amend their constitution to provide for attendance by the
putblic. The provision should be stricken from the consti-
I 11 ion. -

There is not now, nor has there ever been, an honest _

 
    
    
 

   

This is the timegof the year --when the Pitt
student squirms restlessly in anticipation of good
old Saint Nick, the happy spirit who leaves in his
wake gifts, good cheer and a nice long vacation.

Soon we shall sally forth from these memory-
shrouded halls and return to the scenes of our
earlier triumphs in Homestead, Sturgeon, J ohns-
town, Three Springs’ Sauna’  ..........   
Orbisonia, Nanticoke and the
dear old 14th Ward. There we
will bask in all of the glory that
envelopes the college man who
has not yet ﬂunked out.

If we are lambs here, we shall
become lions on our Main Streets
back home. We’ll blush becom-
ingly under the approving pats
of our elder coeds; We’ll ex—  
change ﬁrm hand shakes with the old grads; We’ll
cluck appreciatively over Mrs. Dodson’s new baby
and We’ll tell the latest dirty jokes we’ve picked up.

  

Our triumphant return may lack some of the ,

romance it had last year because the threat of hav-
ing to defend the home town in Korea is -not so im-
minent. But the parties will be as spirited and con-
genial as always, the which leads us into our topic
for the day.

We periodically receive on The News -a publica-
tion called the Clipsheet which is put out by the
Board of Temperance of the Methodist Church. As
you might gather from the name this publication

‘has something to say about Yule spirits.

The Board of Temperance does not approve of
drinking in any way, shape or ‘form; on any occa-
sion and for any reasons other thaneritual or med-
icinal purposes. There is more than just an in-
dication that they approved of Prohibition, there
is a suggestion that they are in favor of its return.

The Clipsheetxis composed "of items, selected

from newspapers throughout the land, which show ,

the disastrous effects of drinking. It might be
well for us to bear them in mind as we prepare
for our traditionally besotted holidays.
Thirsty Bandit

An item clipped from the Los Angeles Times
shows the relationship between drinking and crime:
“Bandit With Thirst-and Gun Robs Bar—he drank
a beer, and robbed the place of $1500.” Let them
go, they’ll put each other out of business.

An interesting little item from the Daily Okla-

Theater Roundup

‘Oedipus Rex‘ Called

Players Show. Polish   ~  

In Greek Classic
' By Dick Snyder

Mr. Harvey Pope and his actors may well be
proud of themselves these evenings. They have
gone to the Greeks for their second play, “Oedipus
Rex,” and come away with one of the most im-
pressive dramas in Player history. '

Everything about this production has a superior
look, from Mr. Pope’s adroit staging to Tess Mvr-
insky’s costuming, and the piercing ﬂuttery of Ethel
Fine.

Dabbling in high Greek _tragedy is like living
next to an abyss. It is an exacting business, but Mr.
Pope, with a large assist from Robert Prenderville’s
set and lighting, and an extraordinarily well-train-
ed army of Players, makes this a distinguished piece
of theater. -

For the uninitiated, this is the Greek classic—-
complete with male and female chorus-—about
King Oedipus and his troublesome destiny, which
includes murdering his father, incest with his
mother, and eventual, self—begotten blindness.

This is no comedy, but then, the Greek dramat-
ists never laughed when they could thrust a spear
instead.

I In his casting Mr. Pope has chosen extremely
well. The stage is charged with ﬁrst-rate acting.
As Oedipus, Ben Tatar adds a moving and anguish-
ed performance to his growing list of accomplish-
ments; John Schano is more than a match for
Teiresias; Sue Delphey and Russel Malone display
an unusual ﬂair for restrained dramatics; and
there are admirable moments from Jerry Lynch,
Herbert Carson, Ray Moran, and Frank Kopta,

plus a haunting shot of melancholy from Anna .

Lou Alex, one of the shapliest Greeks in these
parts.

There is a word for all these Greeks at Stephen
Foster. Remarkable.

misuasen

homan found its way into the Sheet: “State Has
Roads, Drunk Driving Law—The ‘state criminal
court of appeals overruled the contention of the
prisoner, arrested on a‘ drunk driving charge, that
a deﬁnition of highways did not appear in the law
and therefore the court could not‘say WHERE he
had been drunk.” The bottle sometimes inspires
the mind. ~

Dr. Andrew C. Ivy, an M.D. and a vice presi-
dent of the University of Illinois, contributed a
bit of information. He says “It is generally ‘ac-

knowledged that alcohol consumption increases a

divorces, venereal disease, illegitimate births, sex-
ual promiscuity, vice and crime in general.” I
dare you to take a drink after that.

An item taken from the Washington Star seems
‘to have some signiﬁcance, but I can’t decide just
what. “Policeman is Suspended on Drinking
Charge.—-The’ man is a veteran of both World
Wars.” ‘ P

Reckless Paddling

From the same city but in_a different news-
paper there comes another clip of interest. “Drunk
Bike Rider—(he was) arrested on the charge of
drunkenness and reckless bike riding.” Booze and
biking don’t mix.

An item from the Miami Herald sounds a note

I,

of hope. “Sees the Light; Wants to be Preacher; , ;

Homestead Moonshiner Gets Religion——While in
jail on moonshine charge, the man learned to read
and write, and know God.” Sounds like a man
from Homestead but when did they start making
moonshine over there? '

From the New Orleans Time Picayune, the

Clipsheet editors gleaned this little communication;'

“Woman injured gravelyby fall—Drunk, the wom-
an leaned over a balcony too far.” Must have al-
ways fancied herself a Juliet.

From the capital of this great nation there
comes more enlightening news: “Denounces Hus-A
band; Wife Denies Oﬁicer Broke Up Marriage-—

the woman characterized her husband as a chronic I

liar and punch drunk, a most unlikely person to
live with.” Even punch is‘ dangerous.

In closing I throw out an item from another
temperance sheet, the name of which I have for-
“God says no drunkard will get in
heaven.”

has been arranged. _

The service will be available for

the“ basketball opener tomorrow
night with Columbia.
Five Cent Fare

V Chartered buses will operate on
a ﬁve-minute schedule beginning

Ceremonies Begin at 8 p.m.

Game time is 8:30 p.m. The ded-
ication ceremonies are scheduled
to begin at 8 p.m.

Bill Sutherland, radio sports-
caster, as master of ceremonies,
will introduce the principle speak-
ers of the evening.

W. F. Trimble and Dr. John H.
Wagner, representing the Board
of Trustees, along with Chancel-
lor Rufus Fitzgerald and Athletic
Director Tom Hamilton, will speak
on the dedication program.

22-1 Record Last Year

Students must present their ID
and activity cards at the north-
east gate to enter the Field House.

The main attraction, however,
is the appearance of the Colum-
bia Lions——NCAA District I
champs and undefeated in 22
straight games before Illinois de-
feated them in the NCAA tourna-
ment last year. ‘

Under Rossini’s guidance the
Lions have lost only once on the
courts in two years. Rossini, an
assistant to Gordon Ridings just
one year ago, took over when Rid-
ings became ill.

Coach of the Year

Philadelphia s p o r t s writers
named the ﬁrst-year mentor Coach
of the Year and rated his team
the best in the East.

Only two regulars—Captain Al
Stein and Bob Reiss—-of Colum-
bia’s top seven performers re-
turned this season, but the Lions
are still rated tops. ,

Stein (5-11) and Reiss ‘(6-2)
play the guard positions, with Stan
Marotas (6-3) at center, and Paul
Brandt (6-3) and Howie .. Rosen-
ﬁeld (6-5), forwards.

A Wheel of Fortune

Carlson counters with the tall-
est varsity in Pitt’s history and
the tight, deliberate continuity of-
fense. He compares his offense to
a wheel of fortune.

“If a player doesn’t spot a
teammate circling under the
basket once,” Carlson says, ‘‘he’ll
have another chance to catch him

Editor

Everything happens at once at Pitt. The 1oser—Pitt.
Not that Pitt is wholly at error. For the psychologi-
cal makeup of a sports writer causes many strange things
to come from his typing ﬁngers. v

The district sports Writers

have been involved in a guess-

ing game since last August when Len Casanova packed his
grip to seek his fortune in the west.

After the Season, Boys

During the football season Cap-
tain Tom reiterated time and time
again that the football coaching
selection would not be made until
after the season. That is, the
ground work would not be laid
until after the completion of the
grid campaign.

Nevertheless, the enterprising
sports writers kept harping on
the subject that so-and-so might
be the next man. Some went as
far as giving their prediction.

But Hamilton true to his word
stuck out the season. The Miami
Hurricanes were no sooner calmed
to a breeze when Hamilton an-
nounced that the Athletic Com-
mittee would hold a meeting on
Tuesday to decide the procedure of
naming the next coach. In other
words to get the ball rolling.

A Neglected Field House

Now this sounds harmless. But
the intuition of a sports writer
tells him that something import-
ant is cooking and the fact that
Pitt is dedicating its new ﬁeld
house tomorrow goes unnoticed.

Sports writers are known for
ﬁnding a multitude of details in

, some irrelevant matter.

Besides this mixup the Panther
hoopsters are scheduled for a New
Year’s Eve engagement with Yale
and three games during exam
week. All games are home games.

should have been changed to 2600.
Then the chances for a full house
at the ﬁeld house would be good.

Wait’ll Next Year

How are Pitt’s chances this sea-
son?

Dr. H. C. Carlson, who is em-
barking on his 30th ‘Win-’em-all’
year, says, “When things are
dark, you don’t ‘know where to
get help from, but you get it
somewhere.”

“Last week we looked bad, but
the boys found themselves on Sat-
urday against Geneva.”

Captains Were Subs

“You know four of our last six
captains were subs in high school.
We only have one senior (Ken-
drick), but we’ll make the most
of it.” I

In Saturday’s game Geneva

Pitt’s All-Opponent

Michigan State and Ohio State
all - opponent
team this year. Each had six on
the 22-man offensive and defen-
sive units.

The Pantheg footballers picked

Don Coleman_ 190-pound tackle
of Michigan State, as the outstand-
ing offensive limeman. Another
Spartan, quaterback Al Dorow,
was named the outstanding offen-
sive back.

On the defensive team the
Blue-and—Gold gridders thought
that Dick Chapman, sophomore
Rice guard, was the best defen-
sive lineman. In the backﬁeld two
opponent gridders were tied for
leadership with equal votes.

They are Miami’s Jim Dooley
and Ohio State’s safety man Fred

Bruney.

On the offensive team Indiaha’s
Gene Gedman, who practically
beat the Panthers himself, was
named by the Pitt gridders. Ged-
man went 85 yards for a touch-
down from scrimmage.

Bill Reichardt of Iowa is an-
other choice that the Panthers
couldn’t overlook. Reichardt open-
ed the Pitt defense when it ap-
peared that the Hawkeyes were
stopped for the afternoon.

Memories of Blaine Eaton and
Ed Meadows of Duke, who played
at the Stadium in the opener,
stayed in the Panther’s mind long
enough to make the a1l—opponent
team.

For three of the opponents—Jim
Mutscheller, Don Coleman, and
Vic Janowicz, it marked the sec-

Head Yogi

Jim (Foot) Marks, the
champion Yogi of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, was
tendered a banquet last night at
the Friendly Inn.

After the Yogis hadbelched for
the last time, runnerup Yogi, Don
(I told you so) Murdock, presented

» Marks with a gift. After much

handshaking and congratulating,
Marks opened the large package
andfound a one-way ticket to Si-
beria, good anytime.

Should Be in Jail

The kind and thoughtful Marks,
'a father of three dear little babies,
then broke down and explained
that he had been cheating. He
sobbed, “I thought ' so much of
The Pitt Mews that I bribed Pitt
into beating Penn State.”

Captain Tom, who ﬁnished in
last place, yelled, “That's a lie.”
That was the signal for all the
Yogis to grab Marks and crown
him champ. ‘A ten-ton block of

While there, they decided to see

so all the Yogis took to the dart-

They now respect Gentleman

They hit the bullseye everytime.

Newmeyers Whip Kapsules

Two IM quintets were com-
pressed into quartets for a contest
on Falk floor. The Newmeyer Tig-
ers overcame the lack of manpow-
er mauling the hapless Kapsule
Kids, 63-26. Only four men took
the court on each side.

Ronald Brandt pitched in 20
points for the Tigers. Brandt shar-
ed the high-scoring honors with
teammate John Streibich, a 19-
point man. Aiding the Tigers’
cause was their sharpshooting at
the foul line. The Newmeyer team

missed only one opportunity from
the charity line.

The Tigers towered over three
undersized Kapsule Kids. Yet the
fourth Kapsule man was six-foot
two-inch Dave Barton, the tallest
man on the floor. Barton account-
ed for 11 of his team’s 26 points.

Newmeyer’s passers kept the
ball high over the Kapsule cagers’
heads all evening. In defensive
work the Tigers outclassed the
poor efforts of the Kapsule phar-
macy boys.

, ~ Perhaps you’ve noticed that lamp bases,

traditionally made of brass, now are being
made of aluminum. There’s a story be-
hind this change and it tells a lot about
the kind of jobs going on at Alcoa. ‘

It started several years ago when en-
gineers of two leading lamp manufacturers
agreed with..our suggestion that bases of
aluminum would host less. “But will they
beasgood. ..willwehavetoreviseour
methods?” they asked.

The potential savings, a few mills per,‘

lamp times the 830 million sold each year,
made ﬁnding the answers worth—while.
Together we started two long-range re-
search projects. One, to test aluminum
alloys in the weather, fumes and years of
standing idle that lamps must endure.
The other, to ﬁnd the alloy that would
take ﬁve progressive draws, then thread
rolling and ﬁnally, the high temperature
of the red-hot glass that is poured in the
base.

 

 
 

ALCO

 

We tested samples, changed alloys,

the right solder and ﬂux to join the side

Students for Combat

’ By CLARK SUTTON
A Every year about this time, a
certain group of studentsleaves
“the safety of its classrooms and
ventures out into the business
.world to be thoroughly pushed
,7 around by a gift-happy public.
it They are students in the Re-
. search Bureau for Retail Train-
ing, and every Christmas they are
sent to downtown department
stores as junior executives. There
they put in practice all the things
they have learned about selling.
0' As section managers, their ears
are pounded by complaints of
outraged shoppers and their gen-
erosity is taken advantage of by
clerks who want “an extra break
J for a cup of coffee.”
, Tough Assignment
.; That, of course, is the way
[they look at it. Their charges
7 behind the counters are likely to
tell you that the section man-
agers. are the original slave driv-
:e,rs,;,.who wouldn’t give an extra
Freliefperiod to their own grand-
~ni’others. From any angle, it’s a
tough assignment for the student
executives, and they often won-
der, asthey watch children pull
vsanta Claus’s beard, if they
_wouldn’t have been better oﬁ in
; the. army.

students said. “They ﬁgure that

Second Unit in Stores

November to March marks the
length of the second unit, most
of that time being spent in the
stores. In January they return
for studies in a major ﬁeld of
selling, either merchandising, ad-
vertising, personnel, control or
others. A " »

Early in March, the classes are

again suspended for four weeks

and the students work in the
stores as apprentices in their ma-
jor ﬁeld.

dents are, of course, paid for the
time they spend.working in the
stores, therefore their outlay
runs close to $900 for the year.
Total tuition, without payment
from the stores, would average
about $1400 a year. '

Not Always At Home

Contrary to popular belief, the
students are not always assigned
to Pittsburgh department stores
for their Christmas “and spring
selling assignments. At the pres-
ent time,
working in Chicago and Cleve-

land, but the majority are taking.

During their three months of
selling they work-—and work
hard. At Christmas it’s a con-

X-Ray tests last week, according to, Jack Burwinkle, Stu-
dent Congress chairman in charge of the survey.

During the entire ﬁve day per-9

iod that the machine was located
on the ground ﬂqor, it operated at
full capacity. The technicians op-
erating the machine said that they
could not have taken any more
pictures “no matter how we tried.”

Dr. H. C. Carlson, head of the
men’s health service, who helped
Student Congress obtain the nec-

essary equipment, said that he was
“very happy with the way the stu-
dents ‘responded. They couldn’t
have done a better job.” .

Students who took the X-Ray

test will receive notices from the

city health department notifying

them of the outcome of their tests
before Christmas holidays begin.

AF ROTC Gets New Insignia;
Buttons Replaced by Boards

Something new has been added in the way_of Air Force

ROTC insignia.

Shoulder boards with stripes denoting rank have re-
placed circles and diamonds for cadet commissioned ofﬁcers.

Formerly, one, two, or three sil-9

ver discs on the shoulder of the
AFROTC cadet meant second lieu-
tenant, first lieutenant or captain,
respectively. The new insignia
consists of one, two, or three
stripes on the shoulder board for
corresponding ranks.

Under the new plan, cadet ma-
jors will wear one heavy stripe,
lieutenant colonels are designated
by a heavy stripe topped by a
thin one. Colonels rate one large
and two thin stripes.

N 0 n - c o m m i ssioned ofﬁcers’
stripes are basically the same ex-
cept that a roof-like attachment
has been added to the V—shaped
chevrons and the circled star has
been removed altogether.

Sometime in the future, basic
AFROTC students will be issued
blue uniforms to replace the pres-
ent olive drab ones.
