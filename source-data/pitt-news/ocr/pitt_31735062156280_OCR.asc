V A committee has been appoint-

the possibilities of _ a point scale

‘system. for men’s activities.

 Fred Benson, engineering rep-
resentative, was appointed chair-
_man of this temporary committee
by Ronald Ecker, president of MC,
and was instructed to “determine

such a scale.” '

scale is necessary, a permanent.
committee will be appointed by
Ecker.

Goldstein’s Idea
The Councilmen ﬁrst became in-
terested in the proposal a few
weeks ago when Mort Goldstein,
vice president of MC, mentioned
it to other members of council at

a meeting on Dec. 2.

He conceived the idea after at-

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of

proposed plan several Weeks ago
and at the time he was in agree-
ment with it; however, since then
neither he nor MC,has taken any
real action until‘Tu,esday when the
committee was formed.

a. To Limit Activities

‘The scale system would limit
the‘ number of activities, to which
men could belong, since it would
evaluate each activity and deter-

.mine how many points each ac-

tivity deserves. ..
Men in the university would
then be allowed a certain number
of points, and would therefore be
restrained from branching out in-
to too many? ‘activities.
Ecker feels this plan will give

more men an opportunity to in-
dulge in campus activities.

The dean of women’s ofﬁce now
has a scale in operation similar
to the proposed men’s scale,

‘ Evaluating Group Opposes

Election Slates,   In ternal lections

Student Congress’s self evaluation committee report came°
out Monday containing some apparently deeply thought out

Chairman of the committee, Ross Reese, noted some
¢general comments on Congress

and its suggested operation. He
ﬁrst said that he opposed election
slates and internal elections. He
pointed out that in the past, due
to internal election of SC mem-
bers from one year to another,
the important positions in the
group were ﬁlled almost entirely
by the holdovers. '

He said the original idea of
internal elections, to keep capable
students in Congress, had often
been forgotten for the sake of po-
litical slate operation. _
Capable- students, he contented,
are usually re-elected on the basis
of their records by the student
body anyway. Council president
Jack Burwinkel, himself a pro-
duct. of internal elections, agree
with Reese’s report. .
Adele .Marricini in her evalua-
tion of the interest of Congress
members asked a sample of the
group, “Why, did you seek to be-
come a member of Student Con-
gress?” She found that most of
the members wanted to become
solons because they were in ac-
tivities already. Her criticisms of
the status quo were: The people
who get elected are too busy for
the job. Men, because of their ma-
jority in the group,‘ receive all of
the important posts. Internal elec-

Military formal attire,‘ similar‘

tions of members from year to

Committ,ee’s Selection Scored

In his report on the commitee
activity of the congressmen, Joe
Marasco contended that the very
nature by which committees and
committee heads are selected by
the group is unconstitutional.

He pointed out that under the
present system of free appoint-
ment held by chairmen of SC com-
mittees on social, publicity, and

 

appointments, political allies and‘

friends were usually placed on
the committees. He felt that rep-
resentation of each of the major
campus groups, such as IF, Pan
Hell, YMCA, YWCA, and others
would make for better function-
ing committees. _,«,». T

The Social committee, his own
committee, Marasco suggested,"
should not bea standing commit-
tee, but rather a group to set up
the University social calendar. He
felt that it could be called together
when violations of social rules
were discovered. The dean of
women’s office, he claimed, could
handle the processing of social
event petitions. S"

Special Y uletides Recalled

By JOAN HUSTON

There is a special aura that sur-
rounds the Christmas season. In
many cases, each new Christmas
suggests others that have passed.
And in retrospect, there are al-
ways one or two yuletide holidays
that remain outstanding through
the years. Dean Theodore Biddle
and Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell,
two of Pitt’s leading administra-
tors, have seen many of these De-
cember holidays here" at the Uni-
versity. And they, like many peo-
ple, have their special Christ-
masses.too.

Dean Remembers

Dean Biddle remembers World‘

War II best. As he says, “Celebra-

tions here at Pitt have varied 1it- =
tle.”. But from 1941 to 1945 it was_

quite different, for most of the
boyswere gone.

He had undertaken the task of
sending “news letters” to Pittites
stationed all over the world. At
first heihad sent only a few hun-
dred to the boys he_had known
well during their college days.
They were ﬁlled .with intimate
items about the University’s teach-
ers, administrators, and student or-
ganizations. At Christmas time
they told of the various celebra-
tions ‘throughout the Cathedral.

Form Letter Sent — V ,

The Chancellor,‘ hearing of Dean
Biddle’s endeavor, suggested th .t
he compose a form letter that could
be sent to all Pitt servicemen. The
letters then went outto thousands
of boys in every battle-station.

He remembers the replies he re-
ceived, especially at Christmas
time, when the cards arrived in
bundles, and it took him days to

open ‘them. Sometimes. it was

tragic because _he received — cards
and notes from boys who had died,

’ Christmas was different in those days,

* 3% 3!!
a few hours or days after mailing
them, on the bloody battleﬁeld
from Italy to IWo Jima. ;
. But the Christmas icelebrations

continued, though in r a somber

mood. Dean Biddle believes that
the true Christmas spirit was not

at home or here in the Cathedral,

but somewhere on ] some distant
battleﬁeld with a boy who was re-
membering the‘ Christmasses he
had known at Pitt. ‘
Christmas‘ And War

It is perhaps_ ironic that ’ Mrs.
Mitchel1’s ﬁnest memoryof Christ-
mas at the University occurred also

lV[en’s Council to Discontinue .

F rosh Smokers This Seinester  

End of this semester marks the end, perhaps temporari-
ly, of the Men’s Council smokers. for the frosh.

Bill Leach, social chairman for MC, made this announce-
ment at a recent meeting of the men legislators. r

'MC has held this semi-annual’

event in previous years to acquaint
new members of the male stu-

-dent body with activities that are

open to them.

Leach stated, “each semester has
marked a decline in people at-
tending the smoker,” so he and

, Jack H. Hardman, assistant to the

dean of men, held a meeting to

A decide what could be done about

the disinterest among the frosh
for activities. A '
Three Alternatives

They formulated three alterna-
tives to the smoker and on Tues-
dayj presented them to‘the coun-
cilmen. These plans are (1) elim-
inate the smoker entirely (2) hold
the smoker in the afternoon in-
stead of the policy in previous
years of having it in the evening,
‘and (3) set up a booth in the
Panther Room for one week-with
information gathered from all the
activities open to the male por-
tion of the student body, having
a member from MC there at all
times to answer questions.

alternative was chosen as “most
feasible.” ‘
Objections Raised

However, Bob Dickinson ob-
jected to this plan because he felt
it would inconvenience many
councilmen to put several hours
into the project. He favored the
second plan. '

Leach explained it may not take
an entire Week to make the booth
a success and that a schedule
could be developed so that “no

The rest of council agreed with

Harriet Pincus broke into print the hard way.
As one of two Pitt delegates to the National Student
Association conference at Bryn 'Mawr college last weekend,

Harriet and ﬁve other delegates from Seton Hill and St.

Vincent’s had almost reached Haize ,

risburg on Friday night; but a
ﬁat tire forced them to transfer
their luggage to the trunk of an-
other car.

The owner _of the car then drove
them to Harrisburg, unloaded
their belongings, and drove away.
What he didn’t -know was that
Harriet’s notebook was still rid-
ing merrily in his trunk.

Harriet takes lecture notes in
her -notebook. ‘ She needs it for
examinations. Harriet’s mother
decided to do something about it.

She called the Pittsburgh Press
to see how the news could be cir-
culated through the state, so the
man would look into his trunk
and discover the errant notebook.

United Press, scenting a human
interest story, picked up the item,
and printed it in , their member
newspapers. ‘

The idea it c-:+.rr,ies rises above and
beyond the iniixigciizzte tempest that
grips the World. It is emblematic
of the serenity of peace, which will
be won at last by the sacriﬁcial ef-
forts of mankind.”

When the parade of speakers,
representing the other Nationality
Rooms had’ ﬁnished their ad-
dresses, the group sang, “Silent
Night.” And the words and the
spirit of the moment touched
everyone. It was a joyous season
for hope, and the conviction that

b .
peace would triumph at last was
present in all.

He rose and said, “At;

Little “Cathy”

Panther Jay Garber is wear-'
ing a warm glow these days.

At the annual Stadium Review
on Dec. 12, .a little girl named,
Cathy sat there, waiting eagerly
for the Panther to recognize her.‘

A few years ago, during a ‘pa-
rade, the mascot had seen Cathy ‘
in the crowd and had carried her
along for a short distance in his
fuzzy ars. The memory stayed
fresh in her mind.-

An anonymous person told Jay
the whole story", pointed out
Cathy, and the Panther took
over from there. ‘

“I remember you. You’re,
Cathy,” he said. The little girl’s_,
eyes were bright with excite-
ment. The Panther had remem-
bered her. '

‘J: Christmas is one time of —year when yoii hav-e the.
ha_nc‘e to be the kind of person you would like to be all

eeling aboutit. Generosity—the attitude that makes giving

who still trusts his parents and the people he meets from ~

ay to day enough to share with them his deepest and most

This ‘urge to share with them what,he possesses. A naive‘

What is, the point to grinding

to shame the students of Pitt in-
to having a social life on a par
with his personal concept of
“normal college people.” Or does
he have in mind the tomplete
undermining of Pitt’s good rela—,

pective students, and with he: .

many good friends in high school

posts in the area? How can he
‘ feel that he speaks for the thou-

“changes will give the woman

living in a student house more-

freedom _._ . . and will also give
her added responsibility in gov-
erning her own life and in pp-
holding the standards of the Uni-
versity.” ' .

This sounds more like a lecture
for a wayward gir1’s school than
a mesage for college ‘women.
How did the University get con-
trol of the freedom of all the

women here? Did they or their

parents sign it away when they
came here or is it an automatic

- entrance requirement? ,
This business of “giving her

added responsibility in govern-
ing her own life” is ﬁne, but it is
something which the University
has no right to take in the ﬁrst
place. The Universityalso seems
to be underthe impression that
woinen are not responsible after
on weekdays. This
changes on weekends when the

I am greatly disappointed with 1 V

the stand Mr. Kulamer has taken

in his columns of the 5th and‘

10th on Sen. McCarran’s plan to
launch an investigation of the
Communist inﬂuence in Ameri-
can schools. As editor of the stu-
‘dent newspaper of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, Mr. Kulamer

should‘ take pride in the fact that-..’
,_ this is one school that has with-

stood any subversive inﬂuence
and remained absolutely free of
any “pink” tinge. Heading his
last column is the statement,
“Subversive Inﬂuence Greatly
Overstated.” (The correct word
was “OverrateCl,”——Ed.) This I
could never believe. Anything so
much as a hljlit of subversive in-
fluence in, our schools Warrants a

thorough investigation at any ex- .

pense; and in my mind,l‘,O0«0 card

carrying Communists teaching in V .

American schools is a very strong
hint.‘ This investigation is not

By JOHN De NINNO.

On Christmas eve when
most .of Pittsburgh is “nestled
snug in their beds” with snow
piledhigh on the window sills
and the cold wind blowing
outside, Mr. John Huston, lec-
turer in history and hiswife
Joan will leave this ._stereotype
Christmas scene with “visions»of
Puerto Rico dancing in their
and board an airplane
which will carry them to the land
of their dreams for a gay and busy
week there. -

Actually it may not be so gay
as busy, since they are going to
attend a national convention of
Phi Alpha Theta, honorary history
fraternity.

Mr. Huston is the president of
the Beta chapter of the large na-j
tion wide fraternity and with his
wife will represent that chapter at

the convention which opens Dec.

27 and ends with a New Year’s
party Dec. 31.
Beta Chapter Largest

Beta chapter, which has .its
headquarters at Pitt, is the largest
chapter of over 100 that exist
throughout the United States to-
day. '

Since its origin in March of 1922
by N.A.N. Cleven, then a pro-
fessor here who also founded the
national organization, the chapter
has boasted a membership of over
800 people from all over the tri-
As" Mr. Huston ex-
plained, “since many of its mem-

’ bers have moved to other parts of

'the country our chapter can claim~
people from all over the U.S.”

The purpose of the convention,
according to Mr. Huston, is to ex-
change and adopt new ideas, re-
vise the national constitution
where necessary, elect national of-
ﬁcers, and all the other matters
that go with a convention. .

At one gathering the delegates

‘will be addressed by the Governor
1-of Puerto Rico.

should make an ideal delegate be-
cause of his congenial, easy man-

Justified, Goldstein Says

Students are complaining about
the limit placed by the Athletic
Committee on the number of stu-

dent tickets to the Steel Bowl
tournament.

However, Men’s Council Vice
President Morton Goldstein up-
held the action./of the‘ Athletic
Committee. “The action of the
Athletic Committee appears to be
justified,” he said. -»

-The committee is attempting to
bring better basketball to the Field
House by making more money, he
explained.‘ Teams such as Du-

are an assetto Pitt so far as bas-
ketball prestige, according to
Frank Carver, graduate manager
of athletics.

Such teams must be paid $1000

minimum per game or 25 percent
net; also, regular expenses includ-
ing lighting, police, and person-
nel must be considered.

A 750 Pitt quota was arrived at
after considering the number of
students present , at both games

to guarantee that game expenses
‘will be covered by gate receipts.

Deitrick New" Captain

Dick Deitrick, offensive end and
basketball regular, has been elect-
ed as captain to succeed Joe
Schmidt, who announced the se-
lection at last Monday’s banquet
honoring the grid and cross-coun-
try squads.

Deitrick promised the gathering,
which included the frosh and var-
sity players, harriers, coaches, "ath-
letic .family, alumni, and press,
that next .year the Panthers would
equal, if not better, the 1952 rec-

ord in spite of many key regular
being lost. '
The rugged but scholarly pre-
med student cited the number of
good freshmen coming up to bol-
ster the varsity as the brightest
prospect for the future.
Pitt Is Back
More than the usual measure of
optimism blossomed as both Ath-
letic Director Tom Hamilton and

forced Pitt’s intention‘ of ﬁghting
back to the top, particularly when
the latter declared that it is pos-
sible to have good teams and good
students at the same time.

‘EXPERIENCED TYPING—desires

 

Without a doubt the draw for the second Steel Bowl.

- tournament will be Duquesne’s Dukes from Bluff, Pa. They

are the culprits-—though no fault of theirs—who have Pitt
students racing around, hustling valuable activities cards
from others.

It is their hopes of seeing the Dukes in action-not just
one night but two. The trip up Stadium Rd. Dec. 29-30 will
reward the climber four games at L TGURN 5.1 .
the Field House where Duquesne . _v____,_‘2...——--—-
and Pitt co-host Ivy League tour-
ists, Cornell and Dartmouth.

But before I strongly ad-
vocate that 5300 fans will
see Pitt’s most outstanding
basketball card in many years,
let me remind Mr. Dudey
Moore of the Dukes not to
foget to bring along Dick
Ricketts and Fletcher ‘Johnson.

Because if Moore would lose the 6-6 Richard and 6-4 Fletch
among the ever-loving hoop fans in Bluff, Pa.,. the expected throng
would not be seeing the top Pittsburgh attraction. Instead, they
might even witness a defeat for the Dukes.

From my first observation of the Dukes in action, the Blufﬁtes
aren’t “very fabulous” without Ricketts and Johnson.

Somehow, I thought that the reason Duquesne scheduled Car-
negie Tech in basketball was only as a neighborly gesture. But very
rudely the Tartans, who take two cracks at Pitt themselves later

  

Win the season, cut down the Dukes Tuesday-—all of them except

Ricketts and Johnson. .
"Tech lost, 72-55, but without. the talented basket dunkers
theother dwarfed Dukes didn’t look very convincing‘.

The pair in question, though, are really big time.’ Before the
game, for example, ‘they delighted fans by “dropping” balls through
the basket. In the game the pattern was slightly changed. Ricketts
would miss a shot, sometimes, and reliable Fletch was on the spot,
-peering down at the ﬂoor and ‘dropping two points through the hole.

The result of the evening’s frolic meant 17 points for Ricketts

‘ and 16 for Johnson. .

And to top off the affair, both boys are excellent actors,
especially Johnson. He prances around the court, like a Sher-
lock looking for angles. On_one occasion Fletch was awarded a
free’ throw. On the trip to the foul line he forgot he was shoot- ‘
ing and returned very embarrassed, but to the laughter of the
crowd.

Injuries Weaken   at s.,......«

By WILL -HLIVKO ‘

, Injuries to three of Coach
Rex Peery’s ﬁrst-line wrest-
lersccmay prove to be disas-
trous as the Panthers embark
to Michigan for meets with
Michigan and Michigan State over
the ‘Christmas recess.

As in yesterday’s meet with Case
Institute at Cleveland, the absence
of Harold Miller, 130-pounder, Joe
Solomon, 157, and Adam Mat-
scherz, 167, will again weaken a
potentially great year for Peery.
The matmen won nine of eleven
meets last year. .

_Injuries to Miller, Solomonsand
Matscherz is not the only problem
of Coach Peery and his grapplers.
The absence of Eldred _Kraemer,
All—Americ_a gridder and promis-
ing heavyweight, is a blow.

"Kraemer Doubtful

Kraemer, who Coach Peery con-
siders one of the top prospects in
his entire coaching career, is du-
bious about returning to the mats
this winter. The big Swede, victor
in four of ﬁve bouts last season,
hinted that he may give up the
sport.

Coach Peery, on the other hand,
announced Wednesday that he ex-
pects Kraemer to begin workouts
after the Christmas holidays.
Meanwhile, Harold Hunter, who
split two matches last, year, will

A Playhouse Review

Playhouse Has Holiday Hit

By HENRY LANGE
Spirit of the season is displayed at its best this Inonthl

at the Playhouse, with its production of the English hit, “The
Holly and The Ivy" by VVynyard Browne. All the joy and

the audience that cheerful feelinge

so appropriate to this time oﬁ year
———and a reminder of the true
meaning of Cliristmas.

The scene is a small Vicarage
in Norfolk, England, on Christmas
eve. Reverend Martin Gregory, an
aging Anglican parson, and his
daughter, Jenny, are awaiting the
arrival of guests for the holiday.

These guests include an alco-
holic claughter, Margaret; a son,
Michael in the service of the
Queen; two aunts and an old
friend of the family, Aunt Lydia
is a wealthy widow, while Aunt
Bridget, a poor spinster with the
power of vitriolic speech.

Margaret decides that the only
way to overcome her alcoholism
is to remain at home and care
for her father. This allows Jenny
to leave with David Paterson, her

- humility of the Christmas season is present, leaving with

Scot suitor. Rev. Gregory’s prob-‘
lem is much more involved.

After thirty years in the minis-
try, he is beginning to believe
that his work has gone in‘ vain,
that the people of his small parish
are more interested in the local
movie house and pub than their
church.

Russell Whitney scores a hit
with his portrayal of the humor
and love of humanity of the his-
tory—loving parson. The suitor,
William Skelton, is successful with

0

his Scotch burr and humor.

Mary Elizabeth Kane as Jenny,
and Gloria Abdou as Margaret de-
serve tribute also, but the out-
standing feminine role is that of
Alma Lind as Aunt Bridget. All
the harshness of a maiden aunt,
the outward hard shell of crabbi-
ness covering a warm heart, pro-
vide one of the best performances.

William Ryan's ﬁne setting is
also deserving of A acknowledge-
ment. A typical English country
living room is expertly worked
out, and helps set_ the mood of
the play. The fine handling of the
play, its setting, background and
music of carols all combine to ex-
emplify the spirti of the season.
