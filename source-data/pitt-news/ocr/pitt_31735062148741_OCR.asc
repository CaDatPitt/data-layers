2 owman Says
At Dedication

34 Actives, Alumni
Hear Chancellor Tell
Story of Senior Wralk

By Ralph Kallock

“More p1‘0~l.ld of the names than
of the stone walk,” Chancellor John
G. Bowman officially-accepted the
inscribed Omicron Delta Kappa
senior walk from Richard Cassiano,
Ed40, president of Gamma circle, at
the dedication ceremony Monday
afternoon.

All but three of the persons
whose names are inscribed upon
the walk, designating them as the
outstanding graduate of their re-
spective classes, attended the dedi-
cation. Thirty-four active and
alumni members. of ODK partici-
pated.

Among theeformer awardees was
Mrs. A. ‘D. Robb, who, as Anna B.
Schaab, was selected for represen-
tation in 1925. She is the only
woman who has had her name in-
scribed.

Commenting upon the selection of
outstanding seniors, Dr. Bowman
said, “I am proud that Omicron
Delta Kappa has selected men and
women with brains and a quality of
leadership and character which
makes for designs of great living.”

Another name will be added to
the walk on Friday during Tap Day
erxzercises, when members of ODK
reveal the name of the senior who
has been chosen as the most out-
standing member of the 1940 grad-
uating class.

At the dedication, which marked
the opening of Spring Festival
weeli, Chancellor Bowman related
the story behind the senior walk.

“Almost as many_ years ago as
names on the walk, Senator George
Wharton Pepper came to dinner.
One of the reasons he was there
was to raise some money. After
dinner I handed him an envelope
and check and a little later he re-
turned it saying, ‘The devil would
get me if I accepted the check. Give
it to some boy or girl who most
nearly represents the ideal of Pitt.”

For 10 years Senator Pepper‘con—
tinued to send a check. Then the
function was taken over by the
University for several years. In
3935 Omicron Delta Kappa assumed
the responsibility.”

Introductory remarks were made
by: C. Stanton Belfour, dedication
chairman, and national vice presi-
dent of ODK; Dr. W. George
Crouch, assistant professor of Eng-
lish: Sam Camarata, C40, Festival
chairman; and Don Cefaratti, C40.

PVVA
City Will Wid.en Fifth
Avenue to Bouquet

The PWA sign on the corner of
Bigelow boulevard and Fifth ave-
nue does not mean that the lawn
will be excavated or the Cathedral
ﬁnished with the .aid of government
funds.

It only indicates that Fifth a-ve- 

nue will be widened and resurfaced
to Bouquet street.

According to city Oll“lCl8.lS, PWA
contracts are granted to the lowest
bidder and enough money was left
from the recent Fifth avenue
widening project to extend the work
another block.

Work will begin in about ﬁve
weeks since the granite curbing has
not yet been cut.

Although the work will begin at
University place. the PWA sign was
posted on the Bigelow boulevard
to warn drivers not to turn down
Fifth avenue because of the con-
struction.

Panther salesman you see are try-
ing to get rid of extra copies of the
Cap and Gown issue, informed and
generally prejudiced sources dis-
close that the May number of Per-

editor Frank Miller as “a sort of
Spring Festival issue,” the new
Panther begins with an unusual.
Frank Kristufek cover and ends
with a full-page advertisement in
color.

In between comes such extrane-
ous matter as three short—short
stories on the Spring Festival scene,

Eines-or-less gags.

solutions to the parking problem.
This includes ‘a description of what
might happen if the PAA cop mis-

Player ---From Both Sides of the F ootlights

The Audience:

By Nancy Welf er

Abandoning the social significance of their last play, “Adding Ma-
chine,” Pitt Players returned Monday night to the comedy of Moss Hart

and George Kaufman’s “You Can’t Take It with You.”

The perform-

ance was in the main quite satisfactory.

After a rather slow first act, due
probably to the “coldness” of the
audience, the cast helped prove
why the pl.ay was «called one of the
greatest laugh riots in years. One

of the chief reasons for the slow-
ness of the audience in warming up
was, perhaps, their familiarity with
the lines. After a succession of
stage, screen, and radio perform-
ances, some of the freshness had
worn off.

The cast, headed by Mollie Or-
tenberg Penny and Bill lVltcEl_-
wain as Grampa Sycamore, did a
very nice job, McElwain’s delivery
of lines is very effective. However,
he has a tendency toward, overgesti-
culation. Moll-ie~ played the =ifeat1j1_er-
Witted mother of the household
very charmingly, lfow Anne Tum-
pane and ,Ge1$t1:ude Broido did on
Tuesday'n'igh.t we do not know.

Peggy Megee’s performance as
the only sensible member of the
family added the ﬁnal touch to her
many splendid parts during the
last three years. Alice Lewis, as
Essie, achieved the epitome in un-
graceful ballet-dancing, which was
exactly what the part called for.
Julius Cubernek was a very, very
happy DePinna.

Allen Gould as Kolenkov was
splendid. It was, we understand,
his second time in the part, as he
played it in high school. Edna
Kauffman as the other Russian. the
former Grand Duchess Olga Ka-
trina, was equally aristocratic.

If we could suggest anything, it
would be older ‘make-up and louder
Xylophone effects. The characters
looked a little too young for their
parts, especially Robert Shissler as
Paul.

The Actors:

By Bill McElwain

Audiences have the drop on actors and actresses.

The audience can

see the players, but the footlights make the audience practically invisible

to anyone on stage.

But you can hear the audience, behind those footlights, and you can

“feel” them. Through those two
mediums the cast can tell how well
the show’ is going over. Monday’s
performance of “You Can’t Take It
with You” was full of illustrations
of that fact, although the audience
was probably never conscious of it.

VVhen the curtain went up, every-
one backstage waited anxiously for
the first laugh. It didn’t come. Es-
sic, Penny, Rheba, all punched their
lines hard, but still nothing hap-
pened. At that moment, the cast’s
conﬁdence was somewhere down
around zero. Then, Paul came on,
give his lines, and lit a ﬁrecracker.

That ﬁrecracker did it. The un-
expectedness of the explosion
brought a dead silence, then a wave
of chuckles. From that time on
we knew that everything was all
right.

Of course, the lines the audience
l.ikes are often not the ones the cast

thought would be appreciated. After
you go over and over a comedy in

rehearsal, you lose sense of perspec-
tive of what you may expect laughs
on.

We found out something else
Monday night which we all knew,
although most of us hadn’t given
much thought to it. The crowd
enjoyed the actions, such as the
near-riot when the Kirbys enter,
more than the lines, which pretty
well dispels the idea that, “Anyone
can do a comedy. All you have to
do is read the lines.”

That audience, all in all, was
just about the most important fac-
tor in Monday’s performance. An
unreceptive .,.audience. can wreck
even a great cast. The cast of
“You Can’t Take It with you" was
not great, but it was better than
it might have been, because th
audience was with it. ;

Eailitol-’s Holiday

By Alvin Malakoff

Before May, Life at Pitt can only be looked at as a
series of vignettes. It is a few things that have hap-
pened to us that we like to remember, sandwiched in
between a dull routine of classes, of commuting, and of
living the social life we have inherited from our parents.
‘These little pictures aren’t many: a Saturday afternoon
in the Stadium, perhaps, or pushing through the crowd
listening for the first strains of Russ Morgan at the
Military, or the Duquesne riot. Just a series of little
pictures sandwiched into our lives and not many of "them
common to us all.

Our Senior Sta)?‘ . .

That’s before May. But when the first groups sit
on the lawn, when the girls are in their bright dresses,
and the boys in their brighter sports coats, when the
tops come down on the convertibles, and when the cor-
ner benches in all the halls are filled with couples, then
the vignettes end and Life at Pitt becomes one full
canvas. The things that are memories of school stop
being little ﬁllers between other parts of our lives; the
things that are memories of school become life itself.
The University becomes the center of things, the place
where everything happens.

The front porches of the fraternity houses are ﬁlled
every night; intramurals draw little groups even to the
top of the hill to watch; the archers shoot away on the
grass below Lilly Court; fellows and girls walk with
clasped hands through the Commons Room and out to-
ward Belleﬁeld to sit on Heinz Chapel steps; the lawns
are always brilliantly green except when the dew is still
on them during an 8::30. Life is full at Pitt then.

Get’s Nostalgic . . .

It isn’t the little vignettesanymore, but a full pic-
ture, and for most everyone. Cap and Gown, and listen-
ing to gags that no matter how bad they may be, have
something special about them; dancing and singing, and
pointing out how sweet Trembath is as a girl. Spring
Festival week: leis and sitting on the lawn watching the
dedication of senior walk; :1 Players’ show that is a little
more than the others; “cutting” and “wolﬁng” at the
Wednesday afternoon tea dance; carnival night with all
of Pitt there,.really being happy; and ﬂoat parade with
everyone lining the street to watch the ﬂoats and the
races. ,

Almost everyone visits the Tuck Shop of an after-
noon and slips out to the Schenley or the Strand or the
Welland. Almost everyone whiles away hours in the
Schenley Tap room or Frankie’s or the Boot and Saddle.
Almost every one forgets about catching the.street—car
to get home to supper; forgets about getting back in
r-rder to go to the show with the folks and Aunt Tilly;
forgets about meeting with the Ajax AC and keeping
the record of not having missed a regular Tuesday
night meeting since 1936.

‘W . . . Impressions in May

May provides an intellectual ﬁllup, and you go to
class with a little more zest. What the professors have
to say seems a little more important, a little more worth
listening to, or even worth talking about. And you don’t
rush in and out of the Tuck Shop, but saunter into Oak-
land with a gang for lunch. And when someone asks,
you say ‘‘I’m from Pitt” with a little thrill. That’s in
May.

Probably there’s some rational explanation for the
change in May, some reason for this being the best time
of the year. Maybe it has to do with the sun or its
spots, maybe because the windows are open in the
Cathedral and you get fresh air for the first time in six
months. Maybe it is because the year or all four years
are almost over and you get a little sentimental. Prob-
ably, there is an answer somewhere to why this all is
so, but it is not important. .'lt’s just enough to be here.

Human Relationships
By Robert Hamilton

As one with the best interests of Pitt always at
heart, we feel called upon, periodically, to point out
to administration and faculty, the error of their ways.
We ignore the students, because, being one ourself, we
know their ‘case is hopeless. (We know because we
are pretty much an average student and the last alienist
we went to took off his hat, bowed his head on his
breast, and stood at half mast.)

IVe’ve Cot Four Flashers

What we’re getting at is this-—We’d like to see
something more in the nature of human relations be-
We have
several reasons behind this wish. First, there are, to

tween profs and pupils here at dear old Pitt.

put it baldly, a good many four-ﬂushers, mediocrities,
and downright sadists here on the faculty, as any.-
There are bound to be some on the staff of
any large school.

where.
If opportunities were offered for
students to know their teachers better, a good many
of these would be eliminated by student boycott, and
at least it would be known that they are unﬁt to pass
judgement on anyone, much less dish out grades, on
which, "unfortunately, most people outside of school
judge our intelligence and ability.

Second, we ﬁrmly believe that (1) a knowledge of
huma-n nature is essential not only to a successful life
but to a well-rounded, reasonably happy one, and (2)
the only way to gain this knowledge is by knowing
people. An acquaintanceship’ with even the types
mentioned above is valuable, and to become friends
with some of our teachers here is an experience that
will enrich a life. There is more to be learned from
some profs merely by knowing them than by attend-

ing classes for a month of Sundays.

Text-Book Psychology

For example, a knowledge of text-book psychology
may, or may not, help us out in slinking through the
back-alleys of life, but we certainly are going to get
along better with a prof if we know that one of the
accomplishments of which he is most proud, is the
smuggling of enough American cigarette into Germany
to last him on a four months tour. '

‘Or again, if nothing else, it is a lot of fun to ﬁnd out
that a favorite professor once sat up all night to guard
$60,000 in buried Spanish gold which a group of his
friends were supposed to dig up and bring to him by
stealth in'the dark. Sadly enough the friends were
over-optimistic and didn’t ﬁnd the gold. It is less fun,
but still interesting, to find that it wasn’t this pro-
fessor who was the hero of the story at all, but his
father. ' “

Or again, one can get a pretty good idea of what
kind of exams a prof will give, and how he will mark
them, by knowing that he likes to shovel sugar into
his coffee with a knife and hoards pennies.

Many Minds Institutionalized

Lastly, we think that knowing their students bet-
ter would be good for the teachers.
faculty minds are “Institutionalized;” they don’t. know
that there is a world outside the University. They
don’t realize that students have other problems, and
perhaps more important ones, than doing an assign-
ment for Friday, and that at times doing such an as-
signment is impossible. Too many of them rely im-
plicitly on exams for plumbing the depths of their
students. It is evident that the whole exams premise
is based on a fallacious assumption. We never yet got
a fair mark on an exam. A good many of our low
marks, and more than one of our high marks, have
been as representative of our actual knowledge of the
subject concerned as the temperature at the South
Pole on Dec. 7, 1776.

In most big schools extra-curricular communication
between prof and student is an accepted fact. There
are certain difﬁcultiesin its way here at urban Pitt,
but we would like to see more informal seminar classes,
and faculty offices open for purely social talks, with
speciﬁc invitations for the shy students. That’s all,
clear faculty, school’s out.

It is now open-season for after-
dinner speakers. Almost anyone
who is willing to give a free lecture
in return. for a free dinner can ﬁnd
engagements, for the campus ban-
quet season is in full swing.

For the benefit of anyone willing
to earn his dinner the hard way, we
are going to describe some of the
ciifferent banquets on campus and
indicate which ones are worth at-
tending.

The annual Publications banquet
has very bad food, Speakers have
to tell how glad they are to be there;
then they can sit down. To recom-
mend it, this banquet has excellent
u_uips, pranks, and free cigarettes.
in brief, this is the kind of affair
where every man is witty and only
lcod is vile.

In contrast, the annual banquet of
Pi Tau Phi, honorary scholastic fra-

ternity in the College, has excellent
food and short hours. The speakers
are required to make a stab at the
solution of world problems and to
try hard to ﬁnd a place for the
scholar in civilization. Since the
diners have such a wide range of
interests, it is difficult to manage
table talk, and the conversation,
time and time again, returns to the
subject of food.

Omicron Delta Kappa, men’s hon-
orary activities fraternity, sponsors
the best banquet on campus, though
they are particular about whom
they invite to speak. They will not
hesitate to let a local man starve
while they call in an out-of-towner.
Here, too, the general rule is, “If
you can’t be clever, be quiet.”

The atmosphere at the Quill Club
banquet is one of forced gaiety,
since all the “guests,” excepting
the speaker, pay for their own din-

Big Jeff reclined against a bould-

and l’ve never read such drivel be-
fore. You and a couple of other
ninny columnists are sitting at type-

that you can do damn little about.
How in the devil can you either

there’s something you can write

Belated Praise
For Cap & Gown

By Kal'war_y

One of the best machines for,pro-
moting goodwill for the University
is the Undergraduate Cap and Gown
club, and, as such, it deserves the
undivided support of the student
body and the :‘i'aculty.

“Snap Your Fingers” rewarded its
audiences last week with two and
a half hours of good fun each even-
ing. How many student-manned
organizations can you name that
have exercised their efforts to pro-
vide ente.ri,ainment for persons not
even remotely associated with Pitt,
and be satisfied with only some un-
identiﬁed applause? Certalnly, not
the football teuin. Yet '18 beef-
trust inspires or attracts more zit-
tention than any other student ac-
tivity from on and off campus
sources.

Sure, I’m stumping for Cap and
Gown. I’ve seen Mr. Biddle and
Marty Fallon and Ruth Miller and
Max Adkins at work-—-“But Cap
and Gown music is good!" .
“‘We’ll try the entrance from this
side now!" . . “C’mon, kick like
girls, boys!" . “"l‘ake the up»-
beat, the upbeat!” -

l’ve watched Ed ’l‘remb:ith and

xvhon something didn’t come off as
planned. And these aren’t the only
persons responsible for Cap and
Gown. There are about 913 others
who make the annual production
pos;sible.

Yc‘.i.h, I'm st1impii'i9; for tl1ein——
all of them——an-d l’m proud to do it.

For some men in the Grziduute
Cap and Gown Club, I 3.-mnot
stump. This year Cap and Gown
had a student-written script, and
it could have been improved with
some help from the older men in
the graduate ‘ group.
Miller’s script was accepted, how-
ever, they kept their ideas to them-
selves,’ thus depriving the show of-
some help in getting a few new
gags in some full situations.

 

Once Frank ‘

man can accomplish anything with-
in the realm of the possible, if he
wants to. All he has to do is to
cultivate his mind and body to a
determination that is all but un-
beatable, and that’s far from im-
possible. Give me a normal chap
'~vho’s willing to ﬁght likehell for
the things that he wants, and in
six months I’ll make a man of him
that the world won’t be able to ig-
nore. Guts is what does it, I sup-
pose. The guts that’s necessary to
watch two or three years’ work
crash into nothing, then grin and
light a cigarette, and then get back
to work. I’ll tell you something.
Life is a long series of failures. The
cowards fall to the bottom of the
pile; the guys with the guts build
a bigger tower of Babel on the ruins
of other failures!

_“The coward and the lazy man
are never happy; they never accom-
plish anything. You’ve got to grab
life in your two ﬁsts and squeeze
good luck out of it.

What’s Wro rth While

“There’s only two things that can
make a man’s life worth while, the
guts to ﬁght for what he wants and
a wife the world’s well lost for.
Real living is made up of the wind,
the stars, and love of the earth. The
man who ﬁnds a woman who loves
the simple things is luckier even if
he lives in a hovel, than the million-
aire whose heart is barren of the
poetry of life.

“Get this, boy. Lots of people
hitch their wagon to the tinsel stars
of social success. There’s nothng
in the world that any of us own
that we can’t lose except that patch
of blue right over our ears. Never
be afraid of anything. There is an
old Australian saying, ‘Man can die
but once . . at the worst, he can
die but little sooner.’ Remember
that in anything you do . . Now
set the devil out of here; l’ve got
work to do. Go home and put that
in your column!”

food served makes this banquet
eminently worthwhile.

No speaker at the Pitt Riﬂes ban-
quet is ever surprised if the men
hesitate before sitting down, since
this affair comes immediately after
Hell Week. The food has much to
recommend it.

In comparison, the men and W0-

Womeii Reach Revived Panther N etters Hope

SAM Leads in I-F M ushball
As Half-way Mark is Reached

By Alex Zelenski

Half-way mark in the IF race
for nmshball supremacy was
reached today despite the re.-
peated delays caused by the re-
cent unpi"edictable winter and
ea 1-ly spring seasons.

Sigma Alpha Mu, undefeated
pride of the Greeks, is perched in
the league leading position after
notching seven straight victories.
Since they have already played the
weaker teams in the league the
Sammies must still meet their lead-
ing opponents. Pi Lambda Phi, Sig-
ma Chi. and Phi Gamma Delta.
Seven Victories

Pi Lambda Phi, although defeated
by Sigma Chi, also has seven wins.
They are the second place team,
one-half game ahead of the Fijis
and Sigma Chi. Their most im-
pressive victory was over the Phi
Gams, 3-2. Pi Lambda Phi has
been a one-man team all season,
resting all their hopes on Bert Jaffe.

The third place occupants, Phi
Gamma Delta and Sigma Chi, each
have six triumphs against one de-
feat. The Fijis are mainly an of-
fensive team, basing their power on
a lineup of hitters.

A decided contrast is the Sigma
‘Chi team that relies solely on the
defensive support of its inﬁeld.
Both have an outside chance for
victory as they have yet to play the
Sammies.

Phi Epsilon Pi has sole owner-
ship of third place having won 4
and lost 2. Their chance for the
championship is very slight as they
must meet the Fijis, Sigma Chi and
the Pi Lams.

PiKA, Phi Delts Tied

Pi Kappa Alpha and Phi Delta
Theta are tied for the next position
with a .500 average of 4- wins and
4 losses. Pi Kappa Alpha started
off the season on the wrong foot but
of late have been on the long end
of many scores. '

The Phi.Delts after taking second
place last year, were pre-season
favorites for the crown, but bad
play this year knocked their hopes
sky 1/llgll. _

Weekend scores were not marked
by upsets, but many of the contests
were very close.

Pi Lambda Phi was the only team

 

After successfully passing the
first test in the toughestidual track
meet schedule inlPitt history, coach
Carl Olson’s cinder squad bumps
against Penn State in the annual.
battle between the two schools this
Saturday at the Stadium.

The event should provide a ﬁtting
climax for a great Spring Festival
with some of the outstanding spiked
shoe artists in the nation stepping
on the track. In addition to the ap-
peal of big names, an added feature
is the tradition and rivalry between
the two schools. The Panthers like
better to take the Lions into camp
than any other teams on their ath-
letic programs and the same feel-
ing, naturally in reverse, exists in
the heart of every loyal son of Mt.
‘Nittany.

Ten Straiglit Vvins

Another interesting angle on Sat-
'urday’s er.-counter is the fact that
coach Chick Werner’s lads admin-
istered the last defeat on the
Panther record books when they
‘trimmed the Panthers in the ﬁnal
‘contest of l93'.7. Consequently, the
‘Blue and Gold thinclads wi.ll do
everything in their power to stretch

their victory string to‘ ten straight

-at the expense of the Nittanyites. .

Naturally, most attention will be
‘focused on Barney Ewell the Lions’
‘sensational sophomore. dash man,
and Nick Vukmanic, Penn State
captain and one of the nations lead-
‘ing javelin tossers.

Local fans looked with great an-
ticipation to the three cornered bat-
tle among Ewell, Bill Carter and
Happy Stickel, the famed. Pitt soph-
omore sprinting duo. However this
field has been narrowed to Stickel

Baseball Team to Face
Nemesis in Penn State

Staters Will Bring Strong Club to Stadium
Friday for Scrap with F umhling Panthers

Pitt’s rather consistent baseball nine will attempt to stop losing when
they meet one of the best Penn State teams in Lion history next Satur-

day on the Stadium diamond.

, The Panthers showed some signs of life in splitting their two game
series with the Mountaineers but will have to improve a great deal to
worry the State nine. In their last few games, the Blue and White squad

and Ewell since Carter’s bad leg
still bothers him.

It is doubtful whether the blonde
Panther yearling is ready for Ewell,
since the dusky State ﬁyer ranks as
a veteran of the track wars despite
the fact he’s only a sophomore. Al-
ready national AAU titlist in the
200 meter dash, and Drake Relays
100 yard king, Ewell will enter Sat-
urday’s race as favorite.
Vukmanic Favorite

Vukmanic will also rate the fav-
orite’s role in his specialty, the
javelin toss. He holds the Penn Re-
lays record of 223 feet 7% inches,
won the ICAAAA titles in 1938 and
1939, and took the NCAA honors in
7938. His chief competition will.
come from sophomore Jim Elliott,
former state title-holder.

Elliott has yet to attain the 200
feet predicted for him this year.
but if he does Saturday afternoon,
he  cause the Lion leader some
consternation.

Leaders Fall
In F.-TGA. Golf

Eastern lntercoll.egiate Golf As-
sociation champions in both the
Northern and the Southern divi-
sions were defeated in play over
last week end.

Princeton, northern and Associa-
tion title holder for two years, was
defeated by Georgetown, while
Dartmouth, southern leader last
year, bowed to Harvard.

Georgetown and Cornell are tied
for the lead in the Northern divi-
sion, with Harvard and Yale occu-
pying joint positions at the top of
the Southern loop.

Division leaders will be decided
this week end, wth the playotf for
Association championship taking
place the following weekend.

Nine EIGA matches will take
place at Oa‘-:.mont Country Club in
Pittsburgh Friday and Saturday
with Pitt participating in three of
them.

Friday afternoon the Panthers
meet Pennsylvania, which has been
defeated in both its matches to date.
Saturday morning they tangle with
Georgetown, the team tied for first
place in the Northern division, and
Saturday afternoon the Panthers
engage Princeton, the team now
tied for second place with Pitt.

Also on Friday afternoon Cornell
_meets Princeton, while Georgetown
tackles Penn State. Saturday morn-
ing Cornell is paired with Pennsyl-
vania and Penn State with Prince-
ton.

has displayed outstanding pitching
and timely hitting in defeating all
opponents.

Shut Out Syracuse

A contributing factor to the Lions’
successful splurge has been the out-
standing work of hurler Ed Bastian,
who is undefeated in eight starts
over the past two seasons. His most
brilliant piece of work was a three
hit shut out against an outstanding
Syracuse team.

Thus far this year, Penn State has
been victorious over Bucknell, Syra-
cuse, and West "Virginia among
others. The 5-2 win over the
Mountaineers came against highly
touted Charley Seabright.

Keep Same Line-up

' -~ -.;;.-Vgﬁﬂ

Pitt will be out to make up for
the humiliation which fell upon
them when they dropped four games
in as many starts to the Staters last
year. The Lions topped the Panthers
by large margins as the Pitt pitch-
ing corps took a severe pounding.

Prominent in the Penn State line-
up are a number of hard-l1itt.in.g
athletes. Among them are Gates,
left fielder, l\/lenzie, third baseman
and captain, and Sapp, second sack-
er.

Pitt is expected to rely upon the
same lineup which  back the
Mountaineers, when they meetlthe
Lions. The probable pitcher is big
Ben Kish, holder of Pittis lone vic-
tory.

Face Good Catcher

Another outstanding catcher will
face the Panthers when Valerie han-
dles the Penn State catching duties.
Earlier in the season the Pitt nine
saw Charley Hockenberry, Moun-
taineer receiver, perform in major
league fashion.

Pitt baseball mentor Ralph Mit-
terling is still plagued with first
base trouble. Lefty Drobnuski
opened the year on the bag, but
smooth—~ﬁeldi'ng Eel Ziollzowski soon
took his place. li'owevei', Ed’s hit-
ting has become a minus quantity.
and Drobnuski’s sup-:':rior hitting has
given him the job again.

To Paddle Alleghieny Invaders

Anxious to extend their newly
created winning streak, Pitt’s re-
juvenated tennis team clashes with
the inconsistent Allegheny netters
tomorrow afternoon. The match
will be played on either the Trees
Gym or North park rectangles.

Schedule difﬁculties forced the
date change for the match, which
was originally slated for Meadville,
Pa.. this afternoon.

Pitt’s baseline-belters remain
slight favorites to cop the decision
over the ’Gators, who have shown
little in the way of top-flight tennis
this spring. The Panthers, for that
matter have not been overly-im-
pressive, but their improved per-
formances during the last two
matches, indicates that they may at
last be out of the dol.drums.

Pitt’s lineup, as revised by coach
Dave O’Loughlin last Saturday,
looks like a winning‘ combination.
Under the new set-up, captain Joe
Kristufek continues to blast the ball
from number one spot, but from
there on the playing positions
change.

Ed Goehring, who has been play-
ng bang—up ball lately, has been

Registrar Refuses to Set Early Date

Conflicting statements from Vari-
ous sources in the University fore-
shadow the possib:i.lity that senior
University students may not be
dismissed earlier tl~.:;n other stu-
dents. V '

Following custom, seniors take
their final examinations from one
to two weeks earlier than the rest
of their classmates, and consequent-
ly are dismissed from‘ classes. The
office of the registrar has always set
a date on or before which. the grades
of the graduating students must be
registered in the office of their re-
spective schools. The seniors’ dead-
line was to precede that of the
other students.

But this year Endicott A. Batch-
elder, assistant registrar, put the

damper on the seniors’ spirits by
hinting that the czustorn may not be
put into practice this year.

According to Mr. Batclielder, he
instructor m:=.y give the seniors their
exams at the same time as the rest
of the students if he chooses to do
so. And the question of when to
disiniss the graduating class is up
to the discretion of the individual
professors.

In other words. the office. of the
registrar‘ has not issued any official
date on which senior grades must be
in.

But Dr. Omar C. I-leld, personnel
2'-SSlSIEll’ll to the dean of the College,
zind Dr. Ch;-irles S. Tippetts, dean of
the School of Business Administra-
ticn, think differently. They agree

Tetanus znlteport

Oﬁicial proceedings of the latest
issue of American Association of
Anatomists contains an account of
research by Dr. Peter Gray, associ-
ate professor of biology, and Helen
W01-thing, Buhl foundation research
assistant in biology.

‘The .«experiment, to inject Weak
tetanus toxin in such a way that the
embryo is not mechanically dis-
turbed, resulted, according to the
two University scientists, in that
the brain is small in relation to the
body and the effect is not propor-
tional to dosage.

Tetanus toxin is the bacterial
poison which, through its effect on
the brain, cause “l.ockjaw” and
death from infected wounds. The
resultant argument advanced is
that the rate of development of the
brain may be reduced with effect-
ing development of the rest of the
embryo.

SF A Assembly Tries Revival,
Elects Officers Tuesday Night

After a two-month period of relative inactivity, the assembly of the
Student-Faculty Association will meet Tuesday evening at 7:30 o’clock to
elect officers and an executive committee for 1940-41.

It will be the first important meeting of the regular assembly since
some time in March, the April session producing no action when a quorum

failed to attend.

Although internal elections are
usually held at a dinner meeting,
the diminished state of the SFA
treasury made the event impossible
this year. Thus, new junior mem-
bers must wait until the Chan-
cellor’s banquet next fall before re-
ceiving their first political free meal.

Interest in the elections will cen-
ter upon the efforts of the 19 fra-
ternity otlice-holders to push
through a complete executive com-
mittee, a move which could be ac-
complished should the faculty mem-
bers swing the bulk of their votes
to the fraternity candidates.

Under the present elective system,
each member of the assembly votes
for two men and one woman for
executive committee. The co"=nmit-
tee in turn nominates from its
membership two candidates each for
president, secretary, and treasurer,
the final vote falling to the assem-
bly.

Vice president Jack Hoeveler, C40,
proposed a constitutional amend-
ment at the March meeting, pro-
viding for the election of the officers
by the executive committee. How-
ever, April’s no-quorum session left
the present rule still standing.

Members of the executive coin-
mittee for 1939-40 have been Pat
Cusick, E40, president: Hoevcler;
Nancy Digby, C40, secretary; Sam
Whiteman, C40, treasurer; Gertrude
Eroido, C40; and Clarence Shepard,
C40.

10 Freshman Units
Start Scrapbook

The work and play engagedtin
by the 10 freshman units for the
past year will be recorded in a
scrapbook which units are prepar-
ing, announces Betty Teal, C40, unit
chairman.

Each unit will ﬁll ﬁve pages with
clippings, pictures and souvenirs re-
lated to its activities this year. _

A prize will be awarded to the
unit possessing the “most interest-
ing material” arranged in the “most
orignal” fashion. ‘ ’
