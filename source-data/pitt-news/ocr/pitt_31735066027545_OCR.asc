The Pitt Police recently rolled out its newest weapon in the
war against campus crime: a motorcycle unit.

Two new Harley-Davidson 1350 CC, fuel-injected “Road
King” motorcycles became the latest addition to Pitt’s campus

police force at the end of April.

They were purchased with a grant attained through the leg-
islative efforts of Representative Dave Mayemick, who is also a

member of Pitt’s Board of Trustees.

The motorcycle unit will be utilized mainly for nafﬁc control
and special events, according to Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd.
“Sometimes, it’s a problem to block off streets,” said Boyd,

Senate president.

Macleod thought he had lost the race
because,bymistake,aoolleaguehadsenta

“I just assumed that she knew some-
thing I didn’t,” Macleod Said, of the col-
league. “SoItold Keith, ‘Iguessoongratula-
tions are in order’ .”

McDuﬂ'1e, however, knew better.

McDuﬂie’s hrmch proved to be correct.

including Macleod himself, who thought the

but he added that getting patrol vehicles where they’re needed —
quickly and efficiently —— will no longer be a problem. He also said
the motorcycles will be “pretty ﬂexible” in their patrolling meth-
ods and be able to be dispatched “just about anywhere.”

Boyd said the motorcycles patrol from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. most
weekdays, depending on weather conditions, and operate in a sirn- V . _
ilar manner as the current bicycle patrol does. .  ; -. .  _    _

‘They will provide an added measure of versatility and visi- 5; ‘i '

very important.”

0 The Pittsburgh Police Department
went through a major overhaul during
Murphy’s administration and recently
reported a marked increase in performance
under new police Chief Robert McNeilly.

- Murphy has focused on the develop-
ment of both Pittsburgh’s Downtown and
other nei . Last year, the city
spent $254.5 million on development down-
town, $351.5 million on area neighborhood
development, $113 million in riverfront
development and $117.7 million on industri-
al site re-use developments.
Some-examples of where that money
went:
0 Of the neighborhood development
money, Murphy has seen to $73 million in
city-wide ﬁnancial assistance to owners and
developers of residential and commercial

es.

- Murphy has used $10.3 million to tinn
the once-slag-heap of Washington’s
Landing, near Downtown Pittsburgh, into a
residential community. ’

- For industrial site re-use, $16 million
was spent to develop the Aristech Chemical
Corporation at the Pittsburgh Technology
Center, which the city projects will save or
create 270 jobs.

Punch: ‘

Murphy has focused less on w
with his opponents, instead focusing on
city’s record and reaching out to
Pittsburghers with that information.

Murphy has promoted his “It’s not us
versus them” attitude when it comes to
Downtown and neighborhood development.
He says he views these areas as having equal
importance and will continue to do so.

Essentially, Murphy is resorting to let-
ting his actions do all the talking.

Political All'ilialion:Dcmocrat
'|'ale of the lope in 
 Pittsburgh:
0 Since Roston has never held a politi-

' cal oﬂice, it’s diﬁicult to judge him on his

past record. Having lived most of his life in

Pittsburgh, he says he knows the city and
lmows the people better than either Tom
Murphy or Bob O’Connor.

- He opposes tax breaks and grants to
big businesses, saying the money could be
better spent improving the city’s neighb0r{
hoods. ;
- Crooked contractors are the biggesil
problem facing the elderly, Roston saidfia

adding that his youth program would solve 

this problem as well.

“There are many older Pittsburghers
who live in these 100—ycar—old homes, and
the houses are falling down; the neighbor-
hoods are crumbling,” he said. “We can
rebuild these neighborhoods under my plan
and improve the lives of the older citizens.”

Tale of the lape in 
0 O’Connor worked to develop the “88
Cops for 88 Neighborhoods” program,
which placed 100 community-oriented oﬂi-
cers in each neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

0 He initiated the acquisition of the
Nine Mile Run Slag Heap —— an area
between Swisshelrn Park and Squirrel Hill
— to clean it up, develop new housing and
attract people to the city.

0 He started programs to get more
mounted police patrols in the Downtown
and City Parks areas.

- He created the Pitt Project Tutor-
Hazelwood, where Pitt students volunteer to
teach children in Hazelwood, and the
Pittsburgh Community Enrichment
Program, which provides community recre-
ation programs in schools throughout the
city.

0 He revised the zoning code to prohib-
it the sale of ﬁrearms in residential districts.

0 City budget-wise, O’Connor fought
against what he has called the city’s “waste-
ful” spending. Earlier in the year, O’Connor

 

 Oaldand: -

- O’Connor voted to keep Bigelow
Boulevard open, claiming that “l lth—hour
politics” and a change of terms in city coun-
cil chambers inﬂuenced his vote. There’ has
been no vote in city council to approve the
Murphy-Ferlo proposal to narrow the street,
so O’Connor has not had the opportunity to
let that vote speak for or against him yet.

- He has worked with the Pitt Greek
Organizations for their armual “Greek
Week” festival. He has said that he, like
Mayor Miuphy, hopes to halt the ﬂow of
college graduates out of Pittsburgh.

0 O’Connor has played a part in the
lease management agreements for the both
Phipps Conservatory and Schenley Golf
Course, keeping them in the Oakland area,
and says he will ﬁght to develop the area’s
neighborhoods.

Says he'll:
- work to streamline the city’s budget.
0 oppose privatization. He has argued
that the city must focus on efficient man-

agement of the resources it already has.
Strongest Punch: .
Citing evidence from The

Pemisylvania Economic League’s 1994
budget projection report for the mayor,
O’Connor predicts the city’s revenue will
drop from its current $111 million to $104
million.

O’Connor maintains taxes will go up
under Murphy. ‘

He argues that Murphy’s ﬁgures of pro-
jected ﬁnancial success aren’t backed up
and that many of his development projects
were started by the previous Pittsburgh
mayor, Sophie Maslof.

Roston.

“I would support putting a dome on the
thing so we could get a Superbowl here,”
he said. “Something that would bring peo-
ple from 99 different places into the city.”

If the team owners desperately need a
new stadium, Roston suggests they sell
stock in their team.

 Oakland:

0 The Bigelow Boulevard issue is a

' “joke,” according to Roston. “I say, if

you’re 18 years old and can’t cross the
street without getting hit by a car, you
should just stay home,” he said.

- Roston includes South Oakland in his
plans to revitalize area neighborhoods by
training unemployed youths.

“There are a lot of boarded up build-
ings and empty lots that should be utilized,”
he said. “If we want to keep these college
kids in the area, we have to give them a nice

area to live in.”

0 Although Pitt is one of the largest
employer in Allegheny County, Roston
says the University is not his priority.
“They would not get doodely—duck from
me!” he said.

“Financially, Pitt is hurting the city
more than helping it,” he said. “We need to
focus on helping the kids in middle and
high school, the kids who want to go to col-
lege but can’t.”

Says he'll:

0 Fire the police chief on his ﬁrst day in
office. Roston claims Robert McNeilly is
the cause of all the conuption and abuse
pervading the city police department. “I’ve
already got a new chief picked out,” he
said.

Cycles

He was in charge of determining
not only what was the most cost eﬂi-
cient way to establish a motorcycle
unit, but how to keep his oﬁicers safe.

Delaney said he contacted other
police departments — such as the Pa.
State Police and the Pittsburgh Police
— with questions about their own
motorcycle units.

He added that talking to com-
manders of police departments with
one to three motorcycles —— such as
Monroeville, Shaler and Ross town-
ship —_ was the most helpful because
they had experience with units of the
size the Pitt Police were intending.

By talking with his fellow law
enforcement ofﬁcials, Delaney estab-
lished guidelines for the officers.

All the while, Delaney was call-
ing dealers, trying to ﬁnd the most
safety and reliability at the lowest
possible price.

He settled on the Harleys.

“Harley is tested and true,” said
Delaney, adding that the motorcycles
also “hold their value really well.”

Delaney said after deciding on
the style, it was a matter of waiting
for the bikes to come in.

While most Harley-Davidson
motorcycle purchasers must get on a
waiting list of a year or more, the
company halts production to make its

police models, according to Delaney.

“It took a good six months to get
the bikes from Harley,” said Delaney.
‘These bikes are designed for an ofﬁ-
cer to be on for eight hours [a day]. 
Most Harleys aren’t made for that.”

Delaney explained some fea-
tures unique to police-style Harleys:

0 He said their rubber—mounted
engines reduce‘ wear on the vehicle
during its long hours of operation.

- The fuel injection system offers
a crucial “quick start” feature and
improves the already phenomenal
fuel economy of the vehicles.

- Police option packages are
installed on the motorcycles, allow-
ing officers to use the radio, without
removing their hands from the han-
dlebars, and to dismount immediate-
ly, without getting tangled in a snarl
of wires. The trademark ﬂashing
lights of police vehicles are also part
of this option.

Riding into history

Officers Ron Bennett and Al
Mitchell are the two campus police-
men assigned to the unit.

“This is our original tearrr of
bike-onauts,” joked Boyd. He said
more ofﬁcers will be trained in the
future, but Mitchell and Bennett are

8,000 more students toreceive PHEAA grant inautumn

The agency doling out state grants
announced 8,0()() additional students will
receive ﬁnancial aid this fall because of
appropriations in the Pennsylvania budget.
This will raise ﬂie number of students receiv-
ing state aid to 149,000.

The grants awarded by Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Agency are
need-based grants that, unlike loans, do not
have to be paid back upon graduation.

“One of the most important items this

board of directors.

Despite their veteran motorcycle

to go through over 40 hours of training in

The motorcycles — weighing 750
pounds apiece without gas in them —— are
heavier than most, and ofﬁcers have to
remain constantly alert for cars, pedestri-

“Any time you get near people and
more traffic [such as in Oaldand], your
risks on a motorcycle go up,” said Bennett.

“It feels pretty good,” said Bennett,
“and it’s kind of a privilege.”

Compute ches can't claim cleverness quite yet

 

“I was playing against myself and some-
thing I couldn’t recognize,” said Gary Kasparov
following his tournament loss to the IBM super-
computer Deep Blue. Sunday marked the ﬁrst
timethatacomputerhaseverbeatenagrand-

In 1957, Herbert Simon, a professor from
CMU, predicted that computers would eventu-

Pennsylvanians can’t drive out of a wet paper bag  

 

People are stupid, especially on
r the road —— amend that: They are both
.stupid and dangerous. Why is the
speed limit talked about like some
kind of big deal, when the obvious
-reason that accidents happen is that
most people are lousy drivers? Why
are they lousy drivers? Because they
are stupid, clearly, but I also wonder if
it could have anything to do with the
~- fact that the Pennsylvania driving test
is such a travesty of the word “test.”

I took my Pa. test 12 years ago,
and at that time, it took less than 10
minutes, involved driving around a
police simulation of a highway, did
not involve going more than 10 miles
per hour at any time and focused heav-
ily on the abilities of reading a stop
sign and parallel parking. Sure, I had
to show my knowledge of other signs

_ and symbols of the highway, but that

has very little do do with acceptable
driving competence. V
And now legislators are wonder-
ing why people can’t drive 55!
I Let me explain two-lane high-

Tl-IE PITT NEWS

ways: The left lane is sometimes
referred to as the “passing lane.”
There is a reason for this. Assume you

are driving down the highway, at a I

comfortable spacing from the other
traffic, doing about 65 in the right-
hand lane. You see a vehicle approach-
ing to your right from the “on ramp.”
Miracle of miracles, this appears to be
a person who knows how to drive, and
their speed is actually approaching 50
or 60 miles an hour.

What do you do? Slam on your
brakes and panic? Wrong. You check
your rearview mirror and turn your
head to double check the situation
(remembering that little blind spot
thing). Let’s assume that the left lane
is empty. Decision? Using your left
turn signal, you would execute a
smooth move into the left-hand “pass-
ing” lane, in order to allow the “on
ramp” driver to “merge.”

Now, suppose there is another
vehicle in the left hand lane and you
cannot move over. Well, in that case,
you might consider the following
options: a) speed up and move ahead
of the “on ramp” driver, b) speed up
and move left ahead of the left-hand

lane driver, or c) slow down and let
the “on ramp” guy move ahead of you.

Here’s a trick to the “slowing
down” part: I realize that this may be
a novel _ concept in Western
Pennsylvania, however, slowing down
on the highway does not necessarily
mean hitting your brakes. Have you
ever thought of just easing up on the
gas -pedal a tad? It is amazing how
well this works, especially uphill.

Back to the passing lane: I use it to
pass everything that is in my way or
getting on my nerves. Sometimes, I
pass simply because I don’t like the
color of the car in front of me.
However, once I have passed every-
thing, I then zip smoothly back into
the right—hand lane, unlike half the
goddamn morons and idiots on the
damned road who get all excited when
passing a farm tractor at 40 miles an
hour and then seem to think they are
speed kings and deserve to sit forever
in the passing lane. Who are these
people, anyway?

In my experience, they could be
anybody. Young stoned guys, old
drunk guys, greyhairs, purplehairs,
moms with baby seats in every possi-

7

ble combination and dads with their
purchases sticking out of the rear pas-
senger window.

For some insight into driver-stu-
pidity, just check out the bumper
sticker brigade, which seems to sum
up the mentalities of so many people
on the road. “My kid is an Honor
Student.” (And I am a boastful brag-
gart who lives vicariously through my
children, damaging them with my psy-
chological baggage.) “My kid beat up
your Honor Student.” (I am an ignora-
mus of the first degree, and further-
more, I endorse domestic violence.)
“How’s my driving? Dial 1—800-Be-
A—Snitch.” (I know I’m stupid, so
please have some pity.). “Baby on
Board.” (I am so dumb I think acci-
dents are preventable through emo-
tional blackmail — I’ll use that tech-
nique later to get an “Honor Student”
sticker).

I still have to get my own favorite
bumper sticker printed up —— “How’s
my driving? Dial 1.-800-BITE-ME!”

p.r. taylor is a very good driver,
despite a strong instinctive urge to
drive on the left side of the road.

Big political changes in Zaire will affect U.S. future

 

, Almost two and a half years

; remain until the end of the dead-

lliest century ever known to man,
and economic and social insta-

bility continues. Today, Mobutu
Sese Seko, the president of

Zaire, ﬁnds himself battling ter-
minal prostate cancer and des-
perately ﬁghting to remain in
power. The overwhelmed
Mobutu now has little chance of
retaining control.

While Mobutu amassed a
fortune during his 30 years of
rule, his people lived in destitu-
tion, caught in incessant tribal
warfare and economic despair.

,Mobutu’s authority is being‘
“ challenged by‘ rebel leader

 Laurent Kabila, who, to the dis-

‘. ' 3 may of Mobutu, is being recog-

L lnized by many countries as the

;new head of one of the most

 resource-laden countries in the

V,
‘V

world.

Laurent Kabila is coming
closer to taking over the capital
city of Kinshasa. The only thing
that seems to be slowing him

 

down is the mediation of
Western powers like the United
States and other African coun-
tries, such as South Africa, who
want to see a peaceful transfer of
power. This very precarious situ-
ation appears in the news daily.
The whole world is watching
closely. The U.S. State
Department has already com-
mitted a large number of its
diplomatic personnel to this hot
spot.
One might wonder: Who
cares about Aﬁica or any other
country for that matter? We
should all care; with the collapse
of the Soviet Union and many
Eastern European governments,
this once-bilateral world is
quickly becoming multilateral.
Whether it wants to or not, the
U.S. must recognize its new pos-
sible competitors.

Mobutu came to power at a
time when European colonial
rule in Aﬁica was being chal-
lenged by a wave of African
nationalism. Until the mid-
1960s, Zaire was known as the
Belgian Congo, with its orders
coming from the Belgian capital

of Brussels. As done by many
other hegemonic powers,
Belgium controlled its colony’s
mineral industry. The native
people of Zaire remained poor
and had no say, in governmental
affairs. After being forced to rec-
ognize the growing enmity
toward the European powers,
the Belgian Congo became inde-
pendent in 1960. The ﬁery and
powerful speaker Patrice
Lumumba was the prime rr1inis-
ter. Mobutu was the chief of
staff.

However, civil war ensued
as the conﬂict developed
between the ubiquitous Belgian
Army and the native Congolese.
As Lumumba tried to negotiate
with the Soviets for help,
Mobutu saw an opportune
moment and took control from
Lumumba — with Western help
because Lumumba’s plans to
accept communist aid was not
well received by the West. The
1960s was the height of the Cold
War, and anything would have
been done to protect Aﬁica from
the domino effect. In 1965,

-Mobutu became the head strong-

man of Zaire after a coup he
organized himself. It was then
that the Congo was renamed
Zaire, and the capital city of
Leopoldville became Kinshasa.
Sadly, Mobutu joined the
long list of African leaders who
ruled heartlessly while he and
his associates lived lavishly,
owning expensive cars, eating
the best—prepared food and occa-
sionally making token donations
to the poor. The elected parlia-
ments were too often loyal only
to their own t1ibes, while totally,
ignoring the needs of those
tribes that did not have a foot in
the power structure. This bred
heightening enmity among the
tribes that often boiled over into
the civil wars we have seen on
television. Mobutu relied on his
armyto put down these upris-
ings. For the first decade of his
rule, he successfully put down
the rebellions. Lately, however,
we have seen that an unpaid
army is not that reliable. But
after the collapse of the Soviet
Union and its satellite states,
civil unrest in Africa was no
longer a prime concern for the

United States and the rest of the
Western world. Mobutu
promised, in 1991, to introduce
multi-party rule to Zaire. Yet, his
iron-ﬁsted rule only galvanized
opposing political parties.

By the time you read this
article, Mobutu may have ofﬁ-
cially abdicated power. Political
independence apparently is not a
panacea to the chaos caused by
hegemonic rule. Zaire, like
many other countries, is too
dependent on its unpredictable
exports. An ever—increasing debt
and the variability of production
earnings only add to civil unrest.

Representative government
has taken a back seat to tribal
priorities. The end of the Cold
War removed the leverage that
Mobutu had over the West. It
appears that Mobutu simply
allowed greed and duplicity to
turn him into a ruthless and das-
tardly leader.

aware of international affairs, _ as
we will have to be in order to

ing century.

 

Celtic Green
drives Pitino’s
decision

They say money can’t buy happiness.

That’s good news‘ for Rick Pitino,
because it’s going to take more than the
almost $70 million the Boston Celtics are
paying him to turn the 16-charnpionship-
banner franchise around from their 15-67
mark last season. .

The Celtics have been in a wicked
downward spiral since their last title in
1986, and once the likes of Bird, Parrish
and McHale left in the early ‘90s, the pride
of Boston became the laughing stock of the
Eastern Conference.

After a combination of honible drafts,
bad coaching and even worse free agent
dealings, the Celtics stand tall as the “chal-
lenge” that Pitino said drew him away from
Kentucky.

Sure, Rick. I bet the $70 million had

1 nothing to do with it.

Pitino may be one of the best coaches
in the land, but who does he think he’s kid-
ding when he says that the money had little
to do with his decision?

Money is the main motivator deep
down inside most human beings, and in the
world of sports, it has replaced the champi-
onship ring as the goal most strived for.

No longer do many athletes talk about
championship rings. They work toward
becoming the highest-paid player at their
respective position or in their sport in gen-
eral, no matter what team they suit up for.

Add Pitino to that list.

Ironically, only hours after the
Philadelphia 76ers made Downtown Larry
Brown the highest paid coach in the pro
ranks, Pitino realized that Boston would be
more of a challenge than Kentucky.

Wow, Pitino really is a genius.

Just look at what the Celtics have done

in recent memory compared to the annals A

of Pitino:

Over the past two years, under M.L.
(Massive Loser) Carr, the Celts have lost
126 games. In his 15 years as a college
coach, starting at Boston University before
moving to Providence and ﬁnally on to
Kentucky, Slick Rick has lost 124 games
total. Keep in mind that 38 of those 124
losses came in three seasons, too.

Pitino went 13-14 with Boston
University in the 1980-81 season, 17-14
with Providence in the 1985-86 season and
14-14 with Kentucky in his inaugural sea-
son of 1989-90. Granted, the NBA season
is roughly 45 games longer than most col-
lege seasons, but you get the point when

Coach talking extension, will not join Pitino in Boston

Brian Knavish and Kevin lilley

 

Pitt basketball fans + who have
suffered through the departures of
Mark Blount, Isaac Hawkins, Andre
Howard and Assistant Coach Bobby
Jones —— could breath a little easier
last week after learning that the head
of the program was staying put.

On Friday, Head Coach Ralph
Willard announced that he will
remain with the Panthers, putting to
rest speculation that had him follow-
ing Rick Pitino to Boston.

In a Tuesday interview, Willard
said he was contacted by outside
interests, but wanted to stress that he
hadn’t initiated the talks.

“It’s important to notice that I
didn’t go out and seek the opportuni-
ties.~I wasn’t looking to leave,” he
said.

Last week’s speculation caused
some of Willard’s recruits to call
Pitt’s basketball office. While the
coach said he had not considered
holding a press conference, he did so
Athletics
Director Steve Pederson and
Assistant Athletics Director Ron

Wahl, who thought it wise to clear up
the rumors.

“One of the things you can’t con-
trol is what’s written about you in the
papers,” said Willard.

The press caught both the coach
and his players by surprise.
According to senior Chris Gardella,
Willard did not contact him to discuss
the rumors.

“I actually heard through reading
the newspaper,” Gardella said. “I
called Kevin [Willard], and he told
me Coach was staying.”

Despite the press, Gardella said
he never doubted that the coach
would be back.

“I actually thought he’d stay with
the team because of the kids we have
coming back. and the kids we have
coming in,” said the Pitt guard, one of
only five returning Panthers. “I think
he thinks we can still win.’’ 4

Despite the player departures th
Panthers have suffered, Willard does
remain optimistic about the squad.

“When I came here, I thought the
program had great promise. I still
believe that,” he said.

Willard remains convinced that a
new convocation center is perhaps the

Pederson reuilding from ground up

 

The recent rumors of the immi-

of Pitt basketball Head Coach

football.

Pederson countered by naming

The new A.D. gave Harris the
green light to select his football
staff.

“One of the things I told
[Harris] was that I wanted him to
go out and find the best people he
could find,” Pederson said. “I
knew that was one of the things
[Harris] would do  and he did a
good job of that.”

The results of Pederson’s
efforts include a staff with seven
combined years of NFL and USFL
experience who have helped to
guide numerous Division I football
programs to post-season bowl play.

The criticism resumed after an

Panthers run through rain,
opponents at Pitt Invitational

Rain, rain, go away.

Please?

Mother Nature wasn’t willing to
work with the Pitt track team last

Saturday, but the rain didn’t stop the

Panthers, who ran, leaped, threw and
dominated the Pitt Invitational track
meet.

Members of 11 colleges and sev-
eral independent competitors came
together in the annual event, braving
45—degree weather, 20 mi1e—an-hour
winds and a chilling rain.

“The weather didn’t allow for
the best times,” said Head Coach
Steve Lewis. “We didn’t expect to
have rain and horrible weather on
May 10. But we got a lot‘ done this
meet.”

Run sprints in the rain? No prob-
lem.

Pitt junior Joetta Purter took the
100-meter hurdles in 15.52 seconds,
smoking her only competitor,
Malone College’s Paula Mann, who
finished almost a second and a half
behind her. In the 400 hurdles,
Purter continued her fiery ways by
taking first place in 61.2 seconds,
nine seconds over the nearest com-
petitor. ’

The surprise was Thiel College’s
Latiffa Peoples, who defeated Pitt’s
Nina Carter in the 100—meter dash.

I On the men’s side, Panthers
Orrel Green and Jere] Williams fin-
ished first and second in the 400 hur-
dles. Jack Jeffreys was Pitt’s only
competitor in the men’s 110 hurdles,
winning in 14.53 seconds. Carl

department.

“When I took the job, one of the
commitments I made was to take a
look at where we are and what we
needed to do to be competitive,”
Pederson said the day
the restructuring took
place. “I wanted an
effective organization
focusing on supporting
our athletes and servic-
ing our fans. [The
moves] will make us a
stronger, better organi-
zation in the future.”

The result of his
vision has been a more
committed, more
focused athletic department staff, a
renewed focus on Pitt’s fans and
supporters, and some lucrative mar-
keting moves which will soon be
unveiled.

“I think we’ve set a different
tone,” Pederson said. “I think we’ve
set a caring, interactive tone. We
want to make sure that we’re meet-
ing the needs of the donors who are
out there, and meeting the needs of
our fans. They’re really our cus-
tomers, and they’re the most impor-
tant people we have. We’re going to
be unveiling a lot of new projects in
the next several months.

shoe and apparel companies, we
will have some announcements on
that sometime in the next month,
month and a half.”

Then came the early May
announcement that Pitt basketball
Assistant Head Coach Bobby Jones
was leaving to accept a position at
the University of Minnesota. This,
coupled with the rumored departure
of Willard, became the impetus for
the latest round of attacks on the
rebuilding effort.

“I think sometimes people make
too much of [coaching
departures],” Pederson
said. “People some-
times leave because
the opportunity, finan-
cially, is better, and
that’s kind of the way
it goes sometimes in
business. There’s also
sometimes the oppor-
tunity for working for
somebody different. I
always view somebody
trying to hire your staff away as a
compliment to you.” —

Willard’s announcement that he
would remain at Pitt quieted the
recent criticism. But the root of the
negative prognostication remains.
Most critics want success now,
rather than patiently wait while
Pitt’s program is rebuilt.

“We’re here for the long term,”
Pederson said. “There are no quick
fixes in this business. You can win
sometimes quicker than you think,
or than you plan to. But there are no
quick fixes in the world. It’s either

there, or is isn’t there. You have to

be reasonable about it.” ‘

you compare what Pitino has done with the
accomplishments of the Celtics in the ‘90s.

On top ofa contract that places him at
the head of the Celtics bench for the next

six years and in the front office for four ‘

more after that, Pitino has a 3 percent own-
ership of the team. That’s power. »

Can Pitino really be the savior the .

Celtics need? It’s going to take more than a
quick ﬁx to right the wrongs of this fran-
chise.

First thing ﬁrst, Pitino will have to brief
the less-than-qualiﬁed draftees that have
helped Boston become a perennial joke at
the Draft.

VV1th the exceptions of Antoine Walker
from Kentucky in 1996 and Eric Wrlliarns
from Providence in 1995, the Celtics have
done a good job of turning decent picks on
paper into pathetic picks on the hardwood.

In 1991, the Celtics took Rick Fox, one
of the best things to come out of Canada
since Molson, and he eventually became
the team’s captain. A winner in North
Carolina, Fox grew tired of losing and exer-
cised his right to become a free agent after
this past season.

In 1992, the Celtics took Jon Barry
with the 21st overall pick in the ﬁrst round
and in the second round selected Darren
Momingstar with the 47th overall pick
Barry no longer plays for the Celts, and as
for Momingstar — I won’t go there.

Boston had one pick in 1993, and they
took Acie Earl from Iowa. He proved to be
such a force at center that, the next year,
they took another goon in Erie Montross, a
great college player who has panned out in
the NBA about as well as Pervis Ellison,
who ironically is also on the Celtics roster.

Coincidence? I think not.

has inherited is like looking at a a bunch of
no names with a hint of one-hit wonders.

were: Greg Minor, Dana Barros, Ellison,
Frank Brickowski and Dino Radja. This
looks like an all—star team compared to the
yahoos that were healthy down the stretch.
Their backcourt was slim, with David
Wesley, Michael Hawkins and Nate
Driggers coming off the bench. These leg-
ends-in-their-own-minds gave much-need-
ed breathers to guys like Dee Brown,
whose best move was pumping up his
Reeboks at a dunk contest that might as
well have been 20 years ago, and Todd Day,
who left his game back atArkansas just like
Scotty Thurman and Corliss Williamson

1 did.

Must be a Hog thing.

Their healthy interior game consisted
of Wrlliarns and Walker, two budding stars,
but any light ended there. Alton Lister,
Steve Hamer and Marty Conlon saw time
at the center position. Erough said.“

Taking over this team isn’t a challenge,
it’s a death wish.

Boston will have two lottery picks in
the June draft, hopefully for them they get
the ﬁrst pick Trrn Duncan will likely be the
top selection, but where will they get the

‘ cash to pay him? Also, don’t be surprised if

the Celtics take Ron Mercer with their other
pick, if he’s still on the board. It’s too early
for Rick to forget his roots.

Pitino should have taken some advice
from John Calipari, the same man who took
the New Jersey Nets job that Pitino turned
down. Calipari once said that he would
never leave UMass for the pros, but once
the huge purse was dangled in front of his
greedy mug, he cracked and headed down
the Jersey tumpike straight to NBA hell.

Don’t look now, but Pitino may have
just bought himself a similar one-way tick-
et.

Willard is

“There is no real place where students
can congregate in an atmosphere of
togetherness.” A convocation center
would improve overall campus life,
making the University a better magnet
for the nationwide talent pool, accord-
ing to the coach. .

A new venue is also one of
Pederson’s top priorities, and Willard
praised Pederson’s dedication to the
project as‘ well as his administrative
work overall.

“[Pederson] understands that [a
convocation center] has to be a priori-
ty for the University in general,”
Willard said. “He has some great ideas
in terms of financial support.”

Willard also spoke of the signiﬁ-

 

cance of the deal Pederson worked out
between Pitt and Adidas. In the agree-
ment, Pitt will be provided with
Adidas products and equipment for all
sports teams.

Only four other- entities have simi-

lar deals with the company: Notre
Dame, Northwestern, Tennessee and
the New York Yankees.

“That’s a tremendous accomplish-
ment,” said Willard of the package. “It
says something about the program
when you are ranked with such an elite
group in any field.”

Speaking of elite teams, Willard
predicted success for Pitino in his new
job with the tradition-rich Celtics.

“Everywhere he’s been, he’s had a

dramatic impact,” Willard said of his
former colleague. “He will bring a
tremendous energy to Boston. Within
three years, they’ll be challenging for
the Atlantic Division Title.”

Discussions on a contract exten-
sion to keep Willard behind Pitt’s
bench have already begun. The talks
are ongoing, according to Willard, but
his desire to remain with Panthers and
Pitt’s desire to keep the marriage
intact seem clear.

“We’ve agreed as to what’s going
to happen, and now it’s just ﬁnalizing
the legal documents,” Pederson said of
negotiations with Willard.

Willard’s current contract has four
years remaining.

The men’s 5,000 posed the
biggest problem for the Panthers.
Matt Samuel had the lead in the first
half of the race, but the rain and cold
took its toll, and Samuel slipped
back to third, then dropped out of the
race with less than four laps to go.

A little girl's soul comes to life
thanks to The Miracle Worker

Once upon a time,
Americans believed in
heroes. We believed that
some people lived their lives
in such a way as to be
respected, emulated and
even honored. Helen Keller
and her -teacher, Annie
Sullivan, were two such
heroes; what a disgusting
thing it is that today, Keller’s
name is most often heard in
the context of derogatory
jokes about her blindness.

‘The Miracle Worker,”
based by playwright Wﬂliarn
Gibson on letters Sullivan
wrote during the ﬁrst weeks she spent with
Keller in March 1887, is structured as a dra-
matic prelude of sorts to Keller’s own
memoir, “The Story of My Life.” Keller’s
book tells of the years she spent learning
about the world around her; Gibson’s play
instead focuses on the time in Keller’s
childhood when everyone around her had
despaired of ever being able to communi-
cate with the vio1entblind—deaf girl.

Seven—year-old Helen, as powerfully
portrayed by Megan Smith, is a soul

trapped in a box. VV1th eyes that
don’t see and ears that don’t hear,
her awareness of the universe is
 to what she can smell and
touch immediately around her;
like an infant, her only method of
making her emotions known is
throwing tantrums. Her father, a
former Confederate oﬁicer turned
newspaper editor, is almost
resigned to accepting her as a
mental defective when he allows
Mrs. Keller to hire Helen a tutor
from Boston’s Perkins Institution
for the Blind.

« Annie Sullivan’s arrival
at the Keller home in Alabama
marks the beginning of a passionate strug-
gle to make Helen understand that there is
an alternative to her wretched existence.
The miracle referred to in the play’s title is
not only Sullivan’s success, but the‘ fact that
she breaks through the barriers of Helen’s
closed mind in a mere three weeks despite
the seeming impossibility of the task

Elisa Malona’s portrayal brings to light
Sullivan’_s relentless detemrination to tri-
umph at any cost; as Helen’s brother James

Psychiatrist relates her own battle against manic depression

As a psychiatrist, Kay Redﬁeld
Jamison is accustomed to hostility.

In her memoir, “An Unquiet Mind,”
she writes of “a woman who, having seen
an announcement of a lect11re I was to
give, was outraged that I had used the
word ‘madness’ in the title of my talk. I
was, she wrote, insensitive and crass and
very clearly had no idea at all what it was
like to suffer from something as awful as
manic—depressive illness.”

The irony of the accusation must
have seemed particularly sharp to
Jamison, whose success in treating
manic-depressive patients has been great-

ly aided by her personal knowledge of the
affliction — which she shares.

“An Unquiet Mind” portrays a life
spent leaping to great heights of passion
and crashing back down to the depths of
suicidal apathy. Jamison tells of her con-
servative military childhood and her fam-
ily’s history of depression; her attraction
to studies of the mind in general and
mood disorders in speciﬁc; her descent
into chaos and madness while trying to
attain tenure in UCLA’s psychiatry
department; her wild bouts of frenzied
activity and long stretches of lethargic
misery; and her eventual reconciliation to

life with her illness, attained through con-
stant study, careful medication, and the
love and support of friends, family and
colleagues.

J arnison’s powerful language renders
manic-depressive illness as comprehensi-
ble as possible to a reader who has not
experienced it, including the surprising
fact that the “high” periods of the illness
can be just as traumatizing as the lows:

“My mind was beginning to have to
scramble a bit to keep up with itself. 
The more I tried to slow down my think-
ing the more I became aware that I could-

Milla Jovovich and Bruce Willis: How did lwo Hollywood sex symbols end up in such a pure movie?

They say love conquers all; The
Fifth Element proves them right

An evil force is invading
Earth. It can’t be stopped by air,
water, earth or ﬁre — only by the
mysterious ﬁfth element.

The ﬁfth element, it turns
out, is love. Fortunately, despite
such a sappy premise, The Fifth
Element manages to escape being
a sappy love story — although
Bruce Willis does ﬁnally manage
to save the world by uttering the
L—word.

Oops! I probably shouldn’t
have told you that. But since this
is a sci—fi fantasy made in
Hollywood, am I really telling
you anything you didn’t already
know? In any case, we get a visu-
ally interesting vision of the year
2214.

Though he lives in a future of
airborne traffic and automated
apartments, heroic cab driver
Korben (Willis) is still lighting up
cigarettes with a pack of matches;

while this seems ;  
-‘ FILMVIEW

anachronistic, it turns
out to be an important
plot element. More at
home in the 23rd cen-
tury are the airborne
Thai restaurant, the
genetically engi-
neered opera Diva
(the aria she sings is
painfully beautiful)
and the piles of garbage that litter
the surface of the planet —— a
small token of moralism from
which no Hollywood movie can
escape, apparently.

Willis plays his unlikely
superhero role with a charmingly
understated air of self—mockery,
and his heroine, Milla Jovovich
as LeeLoo, brings a creative
interpretation to the impossible
role of The Supreme Being.
LeeLoo’s natural attributes (great
body, fantastic eyes, original hair)

attract Korben’s atten-
tion enough to embroil
him into the story. (It
doesn’t hurt that she
can plunge unscathed
through glass and
metal barriers.) The
villain, Zorg, is por-
trayed by Gary
 Oldman with equal
  parts melodrama and
evil.

The Fiﬁh Element in a nut-
shell: good vs. evil, laughter,
tears, Thai restaurants, marauding
aliens and, finally, sex. Of course,
there’s no overt sex because this
is a movie about special effects
and all that neat cool stuff. As a
summer adventure ﬂick: thumbs
up. For an analysis of the human
condition: Go watch something
not made by Americans.

— Penny Taylor

 

Miracle T.

(played by Rob Smith with delightful teenaged snideness)
observes, the Herculean feat requires the same unyielding
Yankee spirit that led to the Northern victory in the Civil
War. Malona’s Sullivan might well be a military general:
planning her strategy in every spare second, outwitting
Helen’s stubborn efforts to get the outsider kicked out of
the family and turning each of her own weaknesses —-
youth, partial blindness and contrariness — into a

strength.

Though nominally about Sullivan and Keller, The
Miracle Worker pays tribute to every teacher who has
known the joy of helping someone to understand a part of
the world that was previously a frightening unknown.

Memoir

n’t.  I could no longer process what I was
hearing; I became confused, scared and disori-
ented. I could not listen for more than a few
minutes to any particular piece of music. 
Sentences ﬂew around in my head and frag-
mented ﬁrst into phrases and then words.  I
[became] wildly agitated, paranoid and physi-
cally violent.”

Jamison emerges as a proponent — and an
example —— of tempering powerful emotion
with informed consideration. An Unquiet Mind
speaks to anyone who has ever sought to bal-
ance the teetering see—saw of his mind.
