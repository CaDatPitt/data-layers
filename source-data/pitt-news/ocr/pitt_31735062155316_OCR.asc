Comedy Opens February 18;
Final Tryout Session Tonight

By AL D’IPP0LIT0 ,
The University Theatre’s

production of The Playboy of .

the Western World by John
Millington Synge will open
Feb. 18. The play, an Irish
folk comedy, will run for
two weeks.

Tryouts, which began last
Wednesday, will end with a 7 to
10 p.m. session tonight, announced

Wandalie Henshaw, instructor of ’

theatre arts and director of the
play.

Playboy of the Western World
takes place in a pub in a county
village in western Ireland. The
story revolves around the ro-
mance between Pegeen, “a wild
but ﬁne girl of 20,” and Cliristy
Mahon, “a young fugitive run-
ning from ‘peelers’ (policeman),”
said Miss Henshaw.

The play, which is “one of the
greatest modern comedies,” has
“elements of savagery, irony,
and high romance but basically
it’s funny,” she added.

“Playboy in this context has
nothing to do with bunnies or
the magazine, and western. world
merely refers to a county in lie-
land.”

The set for the production is
being designed by Philip R. Eek,
assistant professor of speech.

The script is spoken in Irish
dialect and is given by seven men
and ﬁve women.

“This coordination and interre-

The Clinic renovation also will

consist of re-wiring and relight-

tions between the Clinic and_
Presbyterian-University Hospital;
new elevators, and other verti-

cal conveyors for transporting A

supplies, records and pharmaceu-
ticals within the Clinic.

Painting and minor renovations
will constitute the remainder of
the project.

Said the Chancellor: “Falk
Clinic currently" handles some
65,000 patient visits yearly. This
number will increase as modern
medicine puts increasing em-
phasis on ambulatory care to,
reduce the expenses for the pa-
tient while at the same time

maintaining the quality level of  

care he receives. V

“As an outpatient facility, the

History Department
At Yale Plans Chang

(Collegiate Press Service) ‘

The history department at Yale University has abol-
ished the intensive (formerly “honors”) major in the junior
year and abandoned the division of major seminars into
“standard” and “honors.” The department’s goal is to dou-
ble the number of seminars previously offered.

_ The department also has abolished its discussion courses
for advanced placement freshmen and has added a new col-

lege discussion courses, “Great
Works of History.”

Seminars this fall were open I

on .a competitive basis to seniors
as well as juniors, regardless of
whether they are standard or in-
tensive majors.

No history major is required‘
to take a seminar, but students in
the Class of 1966 who hope to
enter the intensive major in sen-
ior year remains unchanged. In-
tensive students will continue to
write an essay based on individ.
ual research. In addition to their
regular historycourses they will
continue in the senior reading
program.

According to Henry A. Turn-
er,_ J r., director of undergraduate
studies in history, “Under the
old system the decision regarding
the intensive program had to be

Yhade in the spring of their sopho-
more year when most students
had taken only inductory courses.
The new system pushes back the
system a whole year, giving us
information, and giving the stu-
dent more experience.

“The large number of seminars
will give us the opportunity to
expose more students to the close
supervision and intensive work
that can only be conducted in
a seminar forma ."

He noted that the old 

tion» between “standard" and
“honors” seminars was “arbitrary
and destructive.” Often, he said,
the honors candidates want to
pursue subjects offered in the
standards seminars.

Minnesota President Recommends
Adoption of British Tutorial System 

(Collegiate Press Service)

The president of the Uni-
versity of Minnesota has rec-
ommended that American
universities adopt a version
of the tutorial system com-
mon to British universities
and said he plans to inaug-
urate such a program on his own
campus.

0. ‘Meridith Wilson said he felt

in the long run such a program

would require no larger number
of faculty members per student
than is now required for conven-
tional classroom lecture courses.
The tutorial. system differs
from the familiar lecture system
in that a tutor-professor meets
with college students when ne-
cessary and‘ directs or guides
their work — often independent
research -— which the students
have been assigned to do.
Wilson, speaking at the annual
convention of the Association of
State Universities and Land
Grant Colleges, said a tutorial
system should begin with a de-

partment’s faculty outlining “a'

series of fundamental problems
or propositions,” essential to re-
ceive a degree.

This, he said, should resultlin
deﬁning eight to ten “benchmark”
problems that ought to be clear.-
ly understood or mastered by a
student if he is to be considered
proﬁcient in his major.i

Each student would prepare
an essay under the guidance of
his tutor, explaining each of the
problems, relying heavily on a
list of books relating to each
problem.

“At the conclusion of the edu-
cational experience,” Wilson said,
“the young man would have
eight to ten chapters that would
be his best possible expression
of the major proposition in his
ﬁeld.

“By the end of the tenth essay,
he would have been forced to
master the technique of essay
writing as well as could be done
in a two-year period and he
would have pride in the cumula-
tive consequences of his efforts,”
Wilson said. ‘

_ The Minnesota president, who
would limit the tutorial program
to juniors and seniors, said it
would permit American higher
education to reap the two princi-
pal benefits of the British educa-
tional system without forcing
U.S. schools to be as rigid and
highly selective as British ones.

He termed those two beneﬁts a

thorough knowledge of a subject

that comes from early specializa-
tion and an intensive training in
language and literature.

Wilson opposed adopting the
British system of preparing stu-
dents for college. In Britain, he
said, students are given a test at
age 11 which determines whether
or not they will go to college
preparatory school or to a tech-
nical school.

bers and the student “Free Speech

said, however, that “the change
of one person is hardly enough
to solve the problem” of political
rights at the Berkeley campus.
Leaders of the FSM stood firm
in their opposition to_the regula-
tions and scheduled a mass rally

ACLU Fights Rule

On Draft Obj ectors

(Collegiate Press Service)

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a brief
with the United States Supreme Court contending that the
requirement that conscientious objectors avow belief in a
Supreme Being as a qualification for draft exemption is

unconstitutional.

The friend—of-the-court brief——submitted in behalf of

three men who were refused conscientious objector status,

because of non-adherence to or-
thodox religious beliefs and were
convicted for draft evasion —
contends the requirement “cre-
ates a governmentally sanctioned
form of religion and thus directly
aifronts the First Amendment.”

Two of three — who had ex-
pressed “religious faith in a
purely ethical creed”—-won re-
versals of their convictions in
the Second U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which ruled that Con-
gress “has transgressed the lim-
its imposed by the Constitution”
in enacting the requirement.

The conviction of the third.

however, was upheld by the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The ACLU is asking the Supreme _

Court to uphold the decision of
the Second Court and reverse
that of the Ninth.

The ACLU brief left unchal-
lenged the constitutionality of
“conﬁning" exemption of con-
scientious objectors to “religious
grounds,” but questioned the gov-
ernment’s right to deﬁne the
kind of religious beliefs which

- qualify.

The requirement, the ACLU
contends, violates the free exer-
..cise of religion clause of the First
Amendment, because. by exclud-

-.-ing. non-believers in a Supreme
:: Being from conscientious status,

it penalizes them. -The‘ brief‘ re-

fers to several high court deci- _

sions which have condemned im-
position by the government of
any “burden upon the free exer-
cise of religion . . .”

“Religious beliefs have always
been a matter of individual con-
science. Government cannot test
their validity,” the brief says.

Toastmasters Club Pinches
Pennies and Stops ‘Ah-ing’

By MARSHA REHNS
Toastmasters are eloquent
—or else they’re penny-poor.

At their bi-weekly dinner
meetings “ah” -counters

keep tabs of every undue
pause a Toastmaster makes
-during a speech; each one
costs a penny. This is only a
part of the program the Univer-
sity chapter of the International
Toastmasters Club follows in its
attempt to improve speaking
ability through practice in a
small» group.

At a typical evening meeting
of the men's club, members might
be required to decide in a few
seconds what they would do if
they were paupers who had the
opportunity to‘ make $1,000 from
$20, or to extemporaneously ex-
plain their image of the life of a
secret service man guarding the
President.

The ten University members in-
clude foreign students and mem-

bers of the faculty as well as
American students.

Following the three mi_nute ex-
temporaneous table talks there
are two previously prepared sev-
en minute speeches. A recent
speaker at the club was James
Riley, Assistant Governor of
Pennsylvania, Area I. In addition
to the speakers at each session, a
presiding officer, evaluator and
general critic are chosen. These
.members write reports on the
evening's speakers and time all
speeches, often cutting off their
fellow members in the middle of
a pause.

In addition to counting the
pauses, the “ah”-counter, who is
selected at each meeting, also
judges grammar and pronuncia-
tion. ’ ' .

Lt. Colonel William Tinsley,
professor of air science and tem-
porary president of the Univer-
sity chapter, explains that being
a Toastmaster can be one of the
most beneﬁcial experiences a stu-

dent can have at college. “It is
one of the most effective ways he
can learn to communicate ver-
bally with others,” a skill which
can often be overlooked in classes.

“Since every member eventual-
ly serves as speaker, presiding
officer, and critic,” Colonel Tins-
ley added, “he learns skills which
can be utilized in private con-
versations as well as in group
speeches. Students also have an
opportunity to criticize their pro-
fessors methods of speech in an-
unreserved atmosphere and offer
suggestions which can often be
helpful in lectures.”

A special beneﬁt, commented
Col. Tinsley, is derived by for-
eign students whose talks are
often colored by idioms from
their own language. “But there
is no one who cannot beneﬁt
from belonging to the club.” . . .

As an international organiza-
tion open to men only, Toastmas-
ters is attended by everyone from
doctors and steel executives to
carpenters and store clerks, who
“have found the conﬁdence and
efficiency gained from the club
an asset in their lives and pro-
fessions."

Toastmistress Clubs have been
established in many parts of the
country -to give women the same
experiences in public speaking.
“But men probably need it more,"
quipped Col. 'I‘insley, “since they
are more longwinded.”

AnsweriiniFaict i    

It has been a month now since the panel on ‘women’s housing regulations batted

 . pros and cons. on two signiﬁcant proposals— one, that seniors or women 21 or older have

the privilege of living in off-campus housing, and two, that these women could live in the

' ~i , -dorms with no curfew restrictions. -

Dean of Students Helen Rush made it clear at that time that she alone would not
make the decision and accordingly referred the‘proposal to an advisory sub-committee of

I the Student Affairs Committee. This group, besides Miss Rush and Vice-Chancellor of
 Student and General Affairs Alan Rankin, included such student representation as Stu-
“ dent Government President John Vrana and AWS President Faith Leitzel.
_ It is understandable that the end-of- term rush made it difficult to have a decisive
~_ meeting in December, but with typical January optimism the -student body is looking for
  immediate action from this sub-committee and subsequent decision on Dean Rush’s part

so that the idea doesn’t slosh over into an other term. The matter is too vital to ge

 bogged down in red tape, too important a policy not to get cleared. -

From the administration’s standpoint, there seems to be a pressing empirical P1'0b~
lem that letting women live off-campus would help solve and, therefore, may help speed
the decision. The ‘freshman class last September pushed the 1600 mark and there was
some fast maneuvering between» the men's and women’s housing departments to convert

A ‘ study lounges in Holland to bedrooms and to double up in the Towers. .

This year Director of Admissions Jack Critchﬁeld seems to be heading for a fresh-
man class of the same size, and some administrators are hypothesizing a 350 Surplus Oi
students for the number of dormitory beds available. The University has. Webster Hall,
to be sure, but it might be quite to their advantage ‘$0 1“ Sen“? Women hve off-campus
if they choose to help ease the situation. . '

From the women’s standpoint, this issue is a question of philosophy: the pro-
ponents are asking, and j ustiﬁiably so, for a privilege senior and 21-year-olds. should have.
But this practictical element is here as well, and it will not be surprising if it enters into

the decision we expect to see soon.

Administration Faulted 

  The Meaning

of Berkeley Riots

   Allan Schloser

During the last several

' several months, "the Univer-’

sity of -California at Berke-
ley. has been the scene of

‘ widespread discontent. The
‘ Berkeley upheaval, although

ignited by the question of
“free speech” (specifically,
the right to espouse any
‘ cause and to
guarantee im-

munity from
" university
disciplinary
a c ti on f o r
,_ off - campus
A» civil disobedi-
ence),re-
m a i n s pri-
marily an in-
tra-university
in which
students. and faculty alike
are revolting against a near-
ly omnipotent administra..

    

V tion.

It must be emphasized

1 that this crisis is not simply

the product of undergradu-
ate frustration or restless-
ness. There is far more to
the Berkeley incident than

- the demagogic rantings of a
i- Mario Savio or the ubiquity

of beards, sandals, and gui-
tars. It_must be remembered
that the Berkeley faculty
overwhelmingly end o rs e d ,
point by point, the reform

I’ V proposals of the Free Speech

Movement. During the stu-
dent strike, furthermore,
large numbers of graduate
assistants and professors
cancelled their classes as a
gesture of sympathy for the
arrested demonstrators.

IN SHORT, the conflag.
ration at Berkeley represents
a rather violent reaction to
excessive power of the ad-

. ministration and the Board

of Regents. The Berkeley
administration, not unlike

 _ the administrations of other

American universities, is too

i . often influenced by reaction-
 ary pressure outside the uni-
 pversity and is generally out

ident of the University of
California, remarked that
“the ‘multiversity’ is a con-
fusing place for the stu-
dent,” he should have added
that it is perplexing to the
administrator as Well. For
when confronted with dem-
onstrations, panic - stricken
Berkeley administrators
over-responded with an ill-
advised phone call to Gover-
nor Pat Brown.

What was most alarm-
ing, however, was the Board
of Regents’ report of De-
cember 18, in which the fac-
ulty was relegated solely to
the teaching function. Ac-
cording to the Regents, the
administration, not the fac-
ulty, is charged with the re-
sponsibility of formulating
academic policy
curriculum and academic
freedom). It is only natural,
given such a milieu, that the
faculty should protest the
usurpation of its legitimate
powers. _

SOME FORTY years ago,
economist Thorstein Veblen
wrote an essay in which he
warned about the dangers
inherent in the American
“board of trustees” concept.
He argued that such a
governing body, composed
largely of business execu-
tives, represented a threat
to faculty sovereignty and

(e. g., the ‘

free expression. The Berke-
ley eruption, and there will
be similar crises elsewhere,
may well signal the begin-
ning of a student -faculty
campaign to regain their tra-
ditional rights.

The function of a uni-
versity administration, as
Paul Goodman has stated,
should be “to expedite the
essential academic business
of teaching and learning.”
Its immediate responsibili-
ties should be of a clerical
and maintenance nature,
while on a long-range basis
it should be concerned with
fund-raising, physical ex-

pansion, and the like-. In aca- ,

demic matters, however, the
faculty must play more than
an advisory role. Indeed, the
faculty — and the faculty
alone —— must control what
it teaches and how it teach-
es.

‘ALTHOUGH CIVIL dis-
obedience may have been too
extreme an alternative in
the Berkeley situation, the
“strike” remains a legiti-
mate exercise in student and
faculty rights.

One "can only hope that
administrations, be they in
Berkeley or Pittsburgh, will
in the future respect and
consult the other two bran-
ches of the university com-
munity.

Student Critical
Of University

Editor, The Pitt News:

Several weeks ago the Assis-
tant Dean of Liberal Arts was
quoted in The Pitt News as hav-

ing said that this University is ‘

not primarily concerned with the
undergraduate. At the time, such

“ a statement, if accurately. quoted,

seemed irresponsible and per-
haps even ridiculous, but certain-
ly not to be taken seriously. I
was wrong. It was in fact an all
too accurate statement of cur-
rent administration policy.

The University is certainly in
a state of change and of growth
which has understandably creat-
ed numerous problerns. Some-
where, however, in its seeking
for answers to these problems,
the administration has seen ﬁt to
simplify the situation by remov-
ing one minor consideration —
the welfare of the individual stu-
dent.

Witness the deplorable situa-
tion of admissions standards be-
ing redesigned to ﬁt budgetary
considerations, of a proposed cut
in scholarship aid to allow for
increased building construction,
of the head of the advising cen-
ter responding to criticism with
the remark that, “If you don’t
like it, leave.” It becomes obvi-
ous that in the effort to make
Pitt a “great university,” the ad-
ministration will spare no means
to reach its end.

The mockery of the ideal of a
liberal education and the sacri-
ﬁce of the individual student's
welfare are apparently consider-
ed among these justiﬁable means.

I don’t believe the ends justify
the means, and I propose that
the measure of "a “great univer-
sity” lies not in the number of
square feet of building space and
not in the corporate efficiency of
its administration, but in the

quality of its faculty and its stu-

dent body. As long as the admin-
istration of this university con-
tinues to be more concerned with
the quality of its prestige than

- the quality‘ of its. education, and
' "  more-interested: in.its}ir'na'g'e than I

its students, it will remain the
mediocre shell of the great uni-

History Prof j
Enjoys Issue,

Editor, The Pitt News:

Your fascinating Dec. 9 issue
is a collector's item. The “most
priceless” gem needless to say is

on page two. In case it escapes-

The New Yorker} I quote so that
those who missed it may have
this incredible item. Its speaker
is: obviously headed for a college
presidency:

“In answer to Miss Delaney’s
question,” Watson replied, “it isn't
all that bad if the advisor doesn’t
know about the courses being
oﬁered. It is just as valuable to
take a bad course as it is to take
a good course, because you learn
what courses are like.”

There was a time when Pitt
students had the guts to publish
their own evaluations of courses
and instructors and more recent-
1.V~to point ﬁngers publicly at
banquets. ' '

I am circulating this issue to
ex-Coileagues who have left.

“This generous and propitious
grant completes the construction
ﬁnancing of the Dl'0J'8Ct»” Chan-
cellor-Litchﬁeld said. “The Mich-
ael L. Benedum Hall of Engi-
neering will provide thea Univer
sity with study and classroom
facilities for 2,400 undergraduate
and 1,000 graduate engineering
students, approximately double
the present enrollment of the
School of Engineering.

“Moreover,” he added, “this de-
velopment, along with the plan-
ned third wing to our national
sciences quadrangle, will give
the University and the tri-state
area a valuable new engineering
and science research plant.

“Coupled with the University’s
program of ‘spin-off’ of basic re-
search ﬁndings to area industry,
this could be an important factor
in developing a broad research
and industrial base for future in-
dustry in the entire region,”
Litchﬁeld said.

The project is a key one in
plans for the development of the

will be able to expand from its

Matmenopen Here

THE EASTERN Collegiate Athletic Committee's recent de-

cision to permit athletes to compete in spring sports with-

. out attending school during the spring trimester will
strengthen the spring athletic program.

With the new rule, more baseball players, golfers
and track stars will want to come here. They would
only have to attend school seven and aihalf months out
of the year, and they could compete during the latter
part of April and all of May without the handicap of
studies.

COACHES OF the spring sports at Pitt now have a market-
able item: time and money. Time, because very few schools
can offer a boy close to ﬁve months of working time or
vacation time. Time because very few schools can offer
the boy a chance to play baseball without attending
school at the same time. Money, because a student will
be able to work 30 hours a week in April and May and
still compete. After Memorial Day he could work full-
time until September. ‘
Coaches here now hold a recruiting edge over other
E-CAC schools. This spring will tell if they sold their
product.

THE ECAC ruling went unopposed at the New York meet-
ing, showing the trust other schools have in the University’s
- athletic department. Although Athletic Director Frank
Carver said after the meeting that he expected no op-
position from the ECAC, he had been reluctant to re-
lease the news for publication before the meeting.
The ECAC ruling Went unopposed for two reasons.
First, the schools involved in the trimester program
or other accelerated programs have always acted in
good faith. They observe the rules in the spirit that
they were originally intended. .
SECOND, other athletic departments, thinking about pos-
sible changes in the calendar at their own schools, realize
that one day they too, could be on a trimester-type

calendar. So rather than hindering themselves in the

near future, they went along_with a proposal that will
eventually beneﬁt them the Way it will now benefit
Pitt. >

THIS NEW ECAC ruling reflects a spirit of forward-mind-

edhess by the Eastern colleges and universities. The ECAC.

Against Michigan

By BILL CABIN
The wrestling team opens its season against the Uni-
versity of Michigan at 2 :00 p.m. tomorrow at the Fitzgerald
Field House. Michigan was the Big Ten champion in 1964
and poses a similar attack this year.

“They’re a real good team,” said coach Rex Peery,” and
are too tough for us all along the line.” The Wolverines have
already defeated Cornell and Penn State, and have a well-
balanced attack led by Lee Die- b A .
and Rick Bay.

The matmen may have a chance
to pick up some points in the
lower weight divisions, but
chance are slim in the heavier
weights. Tom Heniff or Tony
Liberati will wrestle in the 123-
pound class, and Don Caslow
will complete in the 130-pound
class.

Dino Boni, who’ placed third
in the Wilkes Tournament will
wrestle in the 137-pound divi-
sion. Frank O’Korn and Clair Ril-
ey will wrestle-off this week with

Hoopsters Aiming to
 Even A Record at 44

By FRANK SMIZIK
Syracuse will be the Panthers next opponent as the
hoopsters travel to the Orangemen’s home hardwood to-

morrow night. Syracuse, supposed to be a strong team at.

the start of the season, shows only a 2-7 record.
The main cog in the Syracuse offense is Dave Bing, a

6-foot-3 junior who led the Orange in scoring last year. He

“ impressed ‘Coach Bob Timmon with his passing and scoring
(23 points at Fitzgerald Field House last year).

Timmons intends to have ‘Larry
Szykowny guard the high-scoring
Bing. Szykowny is Timmon’s
most consistent player and his
six foot two inches should en-
able him to guard the only slight-

“ly taller Bing.

Timmons plans to have a new
line-up against the Orange. He
will start Jim LaValley at center
and keep Bob Lovett at forward.

“Lovett is a, much better for-
ward than a center. He has shots
from all over the floor,” said
Timmons. “LaValley is not much

"iof an offensive threat but he is

getting rebounds and hustles for
us." '

Another change is the moving
up of Brian Fisher to the gﬁrst
team. Fisher had been sixth man

and the third backcourt man on
the team.

“We need Fisher's experience
out on the court,” said Tirmnons.
“It was evident that we needed
him in the Quaker City Tourna-
ment when we couldn’t bring
the ball up court against the
other team's press.

“Fisher couldn’t make the trip
because he had the three day
measles. He is a good playmaker
and defensive ballplxayer and I
know he can score although he
hasn't showed it yet.”

The rest of the Panther team
will remain unchanged. Daryle
Ruby will be the other forward

along .with Lovett. Fisher and.

Szykowny will be the guards and
LaValley will be the center.

Gymn astTeains 1... 
But, Still Have Far to Go

By TOM SACKS
Gymnastics is a young sport which is growing in popu.
larity and quality, but there is still plenty of room for
achievement according to coach Warren Neiger.

The gym team‘ will be revealed tomorrow in its home
meet against Slippery Rock. “Tomorrow, you’ll see some
good performances which will "
make you admire the sport,” said
Neiger, “and then again you’ll
see some poor performances
which will make you stop and
wonder whether this sport is
really worth watching.”

This statement by Neiger in-
dicates the state of transition
that gymnastics is undergoing.
One of the main reasons for the
lack of proﬁciency on the college
level is the lack of emphasis in
the high school sports schedule.

In city-leagues around the
country the sport is practically
ignored. It has been in the su-
burbs that the sport has attract-
ed attention and then only as
entertainment between halves of
basketball games.

“There is more of the sport
than ever before,” _said_ Neiger,
“but it’s not really popular yet,
Lack of qualiﬁed coaches has
deﬁnitely handicapped gymnas-
tics. Slowly we're bridging this
gap, thoug .” V

Neiger feels that the sport has
attracted top competitors due to
the daring required in its exe-
cution. “There is a fear of it
at ﬁrst,-” continued Neiger, “but
later there's a tremendous feel-
ing of accomplishment.”

One of_ these performers is
sophomode Jim Saco, who, if
eligible, will perform in the all-
around event tomorrow which‘
includes everything but trampo-
lining. The all-around is proba- .
bly the most important event
in the meet in terms ofscoring.
