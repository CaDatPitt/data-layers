Applications Up 20 Percent

Pitt Reports Anilncreased Enrollment .

By BARRY ZASLOFF

At a time when there is a
strong national trend toward
declining enrollments, when
other universities are cringing
under a weak economy, Pitt con-
tinues to prosper. And at a
record pace.

In fact, it appears that the slug-
gish economy is a rather solid
weapon on Pitt‘s side. The
number of freshman applica-

-cent,

tions here is currently up 20 per-
according to _Kevin
Altomari, assistant director of
admissions. _

“It's partly a matter of eco-
nomics,” Altomari said. “If vo_u
look at the institutions in this
area—except for Allegheny
Community College—since we»
are state funded, we are the most
affordable.”

Michael
counselor at

senior
High

Romzy, a
Peabody

School who currently advises 25
Pitt applicants, also believes that
the economic crunch is helping
Pitt. He said the average student
cannot afford to leave home or
enter into private education.

“I can draw a 50-mile radius,”
Romzy said, “and put 95 percent
of my students in that radius.”

Some credit goes to the
Admissions Office. In recent
years, the lowest figure it has
reported was a 2 percent

increase. Few ‘other universities
are on the plus side. Even then,
for those that have shown
increases, 20 percent is a wild
dream. _ .

Altomari attributes the suc-
cess to direct mailing and good
marketing efforts that his ~ofﬁce
has undertaken in recent years.

Romzy has noticed these
efforts. He said that the Admis-
sions Office has had a considera-
ble input into what is happening ‘
at Pitt. He called the office a
“well-organized group" "that .
“communicates swell and -says —
what it’s going to do, then goes
out and does it.

“Pitt did a hell of a job in
recruiting through the Admis-
sions Office this year,” Romzy
said. “The recruiter that came in
here in October was super in sel-
ling Pitt. They turned our stu-
dents on to Pitt.”

Romzy added that the Admis-
sions Office has, as of late, been
doing an outstanding job. He
credited the office for not losing
a single transcript and for screen-
ing students and sending letters
out quickly, saying that within 4
to 6 weeks, “students knew
whether they were in or out.”

Many of those who were in,
according to Alomari, are look-

‘ ing for a more vocational~ly»-.-._x..
-oriented education. He said that

there has been large increases of ,
enrollments -in engineering and
in nursing.

“But,” Altomari added, “there
has also been an increase in CAS,
which speaks for itself, consider-
ing that most colleges are down
in that area.”

So now Pitt is showing
increases across the board. An
interesting question surfaces:
will Pitt be more selective with

Lobby Trip Endorsement Requested

By PAUL CORREA

The Pirogressivestudent Network

(PSN) asked the Student Govern-.

ment Board to endorse a student
lobbying trip .to Washington, D.C.,
in last week’s meeting.

Thomas Wanko, spokesman for
PSN, said, “Given the cuts in stu-
dent aid and other important issues
affecting students, we would like to
work with the student government
and the Governmental Relations
Committee to send interested stu-
dents to Washington, D.C., to par-
ticipate in National Student Action
Day.” A

PSN’s plan is to brief interested
students on specific issues such as
student aid cuts. After they have
been briefed, the students will take a
bus on March 7 to Washington to
participate in the last day of the
National Student Action Confer-

.ence. A rally on the nation’s Capitol

is planned for that day. -
According to Wanko, Pitt stu-
dents will_bc able to meet with Penn-
svlvania Senators John Heinz and
Arlen Specter and with local Con-
gressmen John Coyne and Doug

_ Walgren.

The Governmental Relations
Committee is already planningto
send four students to the conference,
according to Chairperson Connie

will leave on Thursday‘, March 3,
and return Monday, March 7.

SGB president Mark Downs said 5

he would like to wait until early next
week before making a final decision.

‘Downs said, “I have been talking to

the other members of the board and
they seemed to think it was a good
idea, but we’d like a little time to
think about it.”

In business matters, the board
heard two requests from the Resi-
dent .Student Association (RSA)
and one from the Engineering Stu-
dent Cabinet (ESC).

The first request by-RSA was for
$567. The moneywas to be used to
buy glasses with the _RSA logo
inscribed on them. The glasses were
to be distributed to the guests at the
annual RSA banquet. The Alloca-
tions Committee’s recommendation
was not to fund the request. Alloca-
tions spokesman Steve Smith said,
"As a matter of policy we don’t fund
gifts.” The board voted to reject the
RSA request.

The second RSA request was for
$1,310.80 for its “Evening at the

'Meadows” program. Of the total,

$1,140 .is for rental of four PAT
buses. The remaining $170 is for stu-
dent admission to the Meadows
Race Track and‘ an ad campaign.
Allocations’ recommendation was
to fund the request. The board voted
unanimously to approve the request.

\

request was for $2,898.60 for their
“Omni Lecture Series.” Two thou-
sand dollars is to be used to cover the
lecture fees of William H. Dobolle,
Ph.D., who will lecture on biomedi-
cal engineering. The remaining
$898.60 is to cover Dobolle’s trans-
portation and lodging expenses as
wellas an ad campaign.

Dobolle was actually ESC’s
second choice for the lecture.
According to the ESC spokesman,
their first choice, John DeLorean,
was overbudget and “there were a
few other problems.”

Allocations’ recommendation
was to fund the request with the fol-
lowing stipulations-—that the meal
allowance for Dobolle be cut from
$50 to $35, that his hotel expenses be
cut from $134 to $59.95 and the ESC
resubmit a request for Dobolle’s
transportation expenses. ESC had
originally requested a $50 transpor-
tation allowance for Dobolle’s
transportation to and from the
airport.
~ The board approved the request
as long as the stipulations recom-
mended by the Allocations Commit-
tee are met.

In individual board reports, Dan
Lecce reported that ORL’s Alcohol
Study Committee‘s recommenda-
tions are being submitted to Senior
Vice-Chancellor Jack Freeman and
ORL director JoAnn Woodson.

With Rape

Two Pitt students were
charged with rape Saturday
night following an incident that

happened in Forbes Hall,
’ according to a Pittsburgh
policeman.

Both campus and city police,

however, refused to elaborate on
the charges and refused to release
the names of the suspects and the
victim to the media.

Forbes Hall resident assistants
and directors also would not
comment on the matter and said
they were not at liberty to discuss

Board.

Kathy Brown, a member of the

Student Union Alcohol Task Force,

said that the “majority of the policies

Often times, people in the world
tend to categorize others into neat
little molds. Once in a while, a per-
son will come along who will break
out of .that mold and category and
do what he wants, regardless of what
society says. Grover Wilkins III is
one of those people. -

Wilkins is the director of the
Heinz Chapel Choir, the University
Choral Society, the University
Orchestra and the New Pittsburgh
Chamber Orchestra.

Although choral conducting is his
first love, Wilkins said he developed
an interest in orchestra conducting
while attending graduate school at
the University of Michigan. It’s not
too often that one hears about a
choral director also conducting an
orchestra. '

“Not only in the music world but
in society in general, people have the
intense need to categorize,” Wilkins
said. “Once I became known as an
established choral director, it
became my ‘category,’ and for me to
step out of that was something rarely
done.”

Wilkins said categorizing can be
cumbersome and difficult for college
students because it tends to prevent
a student’s branching out. A

“College should be considered a
time for thinking and exploration,”
he said. “When one finds himself in a
category, he won't step out of these
boundaries, therefore, losing man
opportunities.” ‘

Wilkins was surrounded by music
while growing up in. Dallas and
started singing at an early age with
his father in the church choir. Acting

Southern California, New York,

book is designed to offer short-
cuts to students who ‘would

on the advice of relatives and
friends, he earned a music degree at
Stetson College in Florida before
continuing on to Michigan.

Although higher education is
important, Wilkins said he learned a
great deal more by travelling to
other countries. He spent a summer
at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Aus-
tria, and travelled to such places as
the Orient, the Soviet Union,
Europe, the Caribbean and Canada
while he was with different perform-
ing groups.

The reputation of the Heinz
Chapel Choir brought Wilkins to
Pitt six years ago. He said he saw the
opportunity to do more at Pitt and
recognized the university’s interest
in starting an orchestra.

Wilkins had a dream for the choir
when he came to Pitt, and his dream
eventually became a reality. Because
Wilkins’ last assignment before
coming to Pitt was in France, he said
he knew of a choral opening there,
and he decided that if he got appro-
val, the choir would perform in
France.

Mostquniversity choirs travel to
England and parts of Italy every
year to compete, but Wilkins said he
did not like all of the American com-
petitions, so he formulated his own
travel plans. -

courses for the choir members, and
with a little help from the interna-
tional studies program, the project
got off the ground.

The choir began its excursions to
France in 1978 and went again in
1980 and 1982 and is making plans
for a trip in 1984.

Wilkins said he feels the students
in the choir are beneﬁting from a
wonderful learning experience by
travelling to other countries because
they are able to see France as many
tourists do not. “Since the choir vis-
its the country of France on an in-
depth basis, we do not simply see the
superficiality of the tourist
attractions. —

“We actually live with - French
families in certain villages in which
we perform, in addition to staying in
all types of hotels,” he said. “We gain,

« an image of France that will be

remembered as different from that p
which one sees on a tourist
brochure."

Currently, there are 40 members
in the Heinz Chapel Choir, and most
of the members are not music
majors. Positions in the choir are by
audition; the quality of the choir in

future years will be determined by _

the quality of the people who are
selected. ' V

Wilkins said he is dedicated to the
art of conducting and enjoys sharing
it with the students in his groups. He
said he especially likes to talk with
students as freshmen and again as
seniors, asking them the same ques-
tions and listening to the difference
in the manner in which the question
is approached and subsequently
answered.

the type of students that it

Altomari said “no” to both
questions. “Students aren’t con-
sidered against applicants of the
same year,” he said. “We’re
increasing in number and in
quality. The trend has been that
way for years now.”

Romzy disagrees, “They are
screening a larger. number .of stu-
dents, which is raising the level of
quality,’‘ he said. “They are more
selective now. They refused ever-
yone in my class sections that
didn’thave two years of a foreign
language. They wouldn’t bend
the rules at all.”

It appears they don't have to,
for they have mastered the trick.
They are all smiles.

RSA Ep|ectionsBegin

By BRIAN BALK

The Resident Student Associa-

tion (RSA) elections for next year’s

officers are taking place this
Monday-Wednesday.

According to incumbent vice-
president Patti Gaffigan, the compe-
tition for this year’s is less dramatic
than the intense election last year.

“I really don’t know the people
running in this year’s election, but
last year all the people who ran
really wanted their office,” Gaffigan
said.

President Jay Nalli agreed with
Gaffigan, saying, “There is not as
much interest in this year’s candi-
dates. They really aren’t going out
and seeing what the problems are.”

Currently there are two candi-
dates battling for the presidency—
Allan Grossman and Tom
Shellenberger. Grossman is pres-
ently on the RSA Executive Board
and is the only candidate, according
to Gaffigan, to have any RSA
experience.

“The RSA Executive Board is
composed of representatives from
all the dorm councils,” Gaffigan

 said. “The board helps coordinate

all the councils.”_

For the vice-presidency two can-
didates are officially listed. They are
Cathy Ptaskowicz and Jim Glass.

Running for treasurer is Brian
Foster and Janine Fogel. And two
candidates also registered to run for
the position of secretary—Sara
Stueuer and Keith Reich.

There has been a change in this
year’s elections in’ regard to the
placement of candidate’s campaign
posters.

A “Since last year’s election was so
competitive, we got too many com-
plaints that there were posters and
signs in classrooms and lecture
halls,” Gaffigan explained. “Because
of this, we had to set stipulations to

confine the posters and signs to the
resident halls.”

Gaffigan also mentioned that a
new time for the elections might be
more advantageous.

“I think an earlier date for the
election would permit the incoming
officers to work more closely and
learn the responsibilities ofthe office
better,” Gaffigan said. She also said
that an earlier date would allow stu-
dents to look into the issues more
carefully because they would not be
burdened with school work.

~ “Earlier elections would also give
the candidate more time to cam-
paign more seriously,” she added.

“I think this year’s RSA used as

much energy and enthusiasm in
office as they did while campaign-
ing,” Gaffigan said.

She cited some of the 1982-83
RSA achievements: the establish-
ment of the annual “Pittnic,” the
“Lothrop Challenge” for charity, the
formation of special task forces
(such as the Alcohol Task” Force)
which works more closely with the
administration, the annual “Spring
Fling” and a Holland Hall Coffee
House. '

“Unfortunately, our programs
don’t always get that much public-
ity, and the students don’t get to see
the results of our efforts,” Gaffigan
said. - .

The RSA elections for 1983-84
officers will start today and the vot-
ing schedule runs as follows:

0 Monday—Tuesday, ll -a.m.-1
p.m. and‘ 4-6 p.m. at the Towers
Lobby. *

0 Tuesday, 11 a.m.-2 p.m. at

0 Wednesday, 4-6 p.m. at Lothrop

All students who live in the resi-
dent halls are eligible to vote.

Pitt Group Strives For Peace“

By PATTI VISHNESKY

News about the Middle East is
heard and seen everyday in America.
To better understand the happen-
ings of that region, a Pitt student
organized the Youth Institute for
Peace in the Middle East (YIPME),
and last semester, the group received-
partial recognition from the Student
Government Board. V

YIPME is part of a nationally-
based organization established in
the late 1960s to provide an educa-
tional program that would provide
students with an understanding of
the Arab-Israeli conflict, emphasize
the need of democratic institutions
in the Mideast and examine policies
that WOUIO promote peace’ auu
democracy. The group hoped to
explain American interests in the
Mideast and inform students of the
need to justify lsrael’s existence and
attain a sincere Arab-Israeli
reconciliation. .

The Pitt based organization is
basically an informative group that
strives to be as unbiased as possible.
This way, the group is able to main-
tain a broad-based coalition of
groups that support democratic
values. '

When the club first formed, most
of the members were graduate stu-
dents; now there are 25 members

A that are all involved in a wide variety .

of things. ,

“The Middle East has always been
considered a hot-spot by the press in
the United States,”. said club
founder Donna Ricker, “because of
the continuous intervention of for-
eign powers trying to use the area for
theirown purposes.”

Zamir Zahavi, business manager
of the group, said the main problem
in the Mideast is the lack of correct
information coming out of the
region.

Zahavi, economics major, has
lived in many countries and said he

can accurately separate reality from
myth in information distributed in
the .U.S.

“Political awareness in the U.S. is
higher than most countries because
of the press and broadcasting net-
works,” Ricker said. “But that

doesn’t make it accurate.”

Due to the press and foreign
ambassadors, the Middle East has
received the short end of the stick
where information on the culture
and the actual situation in the region‘
is concerned, she said.

 

A Pregant?
5 We can help.

“The American people in contact
with the Middle East are only there —
on a short-term basis because of the
frequent change of presidents,"
Zahavi said, “and no one really gets
to ‘know the area."

The national organization of
YIPME organizes seminars and
briefings, both independently and
with youth organizations nation-
wide, to educate the American
public. I A

Activists in YIPME often organ-
ize and participate in rallies, demon-
strations and petition drives and

distribute literature each year as a

way to inform people about the
Mideast. ' ' .
Because Pitt’s group is only a par-
tially recognized group, it must co-
sponsor its programs with other

organizations. Many Pitt professors ‘

are active in‘ Middle East politics
and frequently co-sponsor
programs. M

In the spring, the group will co-
sponsor programs dealing with the
women, energy, labor and interna-
tional intervention in the Mideast.

An'niversary Marked

Pitt’s University Center for
Social and, Urban Research
(UCSUR) is marking its tenth
anniversary today. As a program
which could have impact on eco-
nomic growth and the redirec-
tion of the commonwealth, it has
been assembling economic,
industrial and social data forthe
Western Pennsylvania region
which could have a bearing on
the industrial future of the area.

The center is a university--
based research facility in_volved
in many programs and has made
some progress in its current
undertakings—-—analyzing chan-
ges in employment by industry

‘from 1969 to 1980 for l0 counties
in southwestern Pennsylvania.
According. to Roger Ahlbrandt,
Jr., associate director. of
USCUR, there are many factors p
which could be particularly use-

ful to attracting new industry
and jobs in the area. The ‘data
UCSUR is compiling could help
determine those. factors.

factors. -

The center also focuses on
problems that plague specific
communities such as housing.

The Ben Franklin Partnership
Program, which the center was‘
instrumental in drafting, is
expected. to be set into motion.
Under this program, Pitt and
CMU will organize a business
consortium which will consist of
Western Pennsylvania’s busi-
ness, education and investment
groups. Pitt and Carnegie-
Mellon University jointly ap-'
plied for the partnership». grant.
Research done under this grant
could have significant impact on
the future of technology in the
area.

Yes,.Virginia, student editors do have rights.
V A recent column in The Pittsburgh Press by that
savior of democracy, James J. Kilpatrick, stated, in
brief, that editors of college newspapers have no rights
becausethey are ownedby the universityand therefore
. should abide by the university’s wishes. _
Kilpatricl(’s column stemmed from a court incident
that pitted the editor of the Howard University paper
against the administration of Howard. The paper's _, -
editor found out that Howard's legal system was dis-- . I ' ' ' « ' . 1

promotion. The story appeared in print, and when the I ‘  | I h '  t .
president of the university ordered the editor to stop - e  0 * ' e - I

The president then found out that the editor had V _r A _ V _ ‘ _ — . .

The Pitt News, Monday February‘ 28, I983

. By ‘MARTY WILLIS '

Each of us has some vision of the world as
we would like it to be. However, it’s natural
for us to notice that what is going on in the
world around us doesn’t exactly reflect our
vision of social life as it could be. Giventhe

. current state of the local, national and world

economy, it’s getting harder and harder to
find anyone who rally likes the present state
of affairs. Unemployment. inﬂation and vio-
lence do not appear to have staunch_sup-
porters, and yet they continue. Few favor the
wholesale build—up of nuclear weapon stock-
piles if it will lead to a nuclear war, and yet
the arms race progresses——more danger-
ously today than ever before.

What's going on around here? Could it be
that we need to participatemore, socially

and politically, if we want our ‘visions to"

come true? I believe so. Life is short and
consists of so much more than mere survival
and nice relationships with friends and fam-
ily. While we’re here, we owe it to ourselves

-/;§,}».to make some kind of an impact on the

planet. To me, it really looks like some of us
have lost sight .of our dreams and visions, to
the point‘ that we forget ‘that we ever had
them. But we do have them.

If you’re an undergraduate here at Pitt,
you have probably noticed the number of
people around here who don’t even register
to vote. If you ask them why, thev often sav.
“I’m not into politics, man,” as though poli-
tics is not an important area of life. Ah, but it
is—over the long haul, you can’t get around

' it. Political decisons that affect you and me,

directly or indirectly are made every day.

By JIM KANE

I know what will happen and how I will
act. I really have no choice. Then again,
none of us ever has a choice when it comes to
what we are ultimately up against. Some
people, including myself, try to resist—and

The area of politics is similar to the area of
romance—you can put it out of your mind,
say, for a year or two, but ultimately, every
person will be compelled to face the ques-
tion, “Am I going to get involved or not?”

A Vision Of What The World Should Be

probably come to dominate the political
area, making the pluralist ideal of American
society even more mythical than it already is.

And, here at Pitt, the students who go into
student government end up finding a good
bit of money each year which they‘ must

“The opportunity always exists for us to make
some contribution on a social or societal level.”

force the status quo. But few really like the

status quo, consideringthepresent shape of

theeconomy. Are we willing, however, to
take action? If we don’t even try to partici-
pate politically, we ensure that our national
leaders won’t hear us. We can count on not
making any real impact——ever. '

If the l970s were characterized by an all-
consuming concern for the self of the “Me
generation,” it should be no surprise that
today fewer people participate on any level
and have created a void by their inaction.
But when you allow a “participaition void”
to develop, you surrender powder as well.
Those sitting at the top of the American
policy are already playing and win:ning a

power game and will be only too willing to.

claim more decision-making power. If we
are not willing to use our power pie, however
small it may be, somebody else will. On a
national level, a small group of actors will

responsibly decide how to spend within
guidelines. They don’t get a whole lot of ~

input from students so those groups that do
ask for money usually get it.
-Democracy simply will not maintain itself
and if we take it for granted, it deteriorates.
For example, many citizens are not aware
thatithe Reagan administration has actively
sought to rescind the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act (which requires that the govern-

icans must be committed to taking astand
against these dangerous proposals, or they
may well succeed. .
Therefore, like a house or a car, demo-
.cracy must be actively maintained, rebuilt
and remodeled. By whom? By us—who else
do we expect to take care of us? When we
“leave politics to the politicians,” they cut

student aid, cut job training programs, med-
dlerin Indochinaand Central America and
radically escalate the arms race. When we

abdicate our right to get involved, those at '

the top lose all touch with middle and
working-class citizens. Just look at the

' results.

If we don’t like what we see, we can
respond in a number of ways. We can block
out reality by blowing our minds with alco-
hol or other substances, but that doesn't
make matters any better. We can give up and
withdraw the job of building the future, but
then all that’s left is living, working and
dying. We can complain bitterly, but that
only inspires those who already agree to
complain with us. Or we can actively work
together with people who share our visions
in creating the new and hopefully better real-
ities of tomorrow.

The opportunity" always exists for us to
make some contribution on a social or socie-
tal level. Voting could be viewed as only the
bare minimum of what is available in the
area of political participation.

When you play the game of simply surviv-
ing, getting by or getting through school,
you are playing what is really a rather small-
time game. I happen to be unemployed and
broke as many are, but I look around this
country and see that, ultimately, everybody

ii ’ ends up surviving anyway, whether he limits

himself to “just getting by” or not. A much
bigger and more satisfying game to play is
that of making a difference on this planet in
the short time that we have. ‘

lnsearch OfHeroes

By KATHERINE M. BEZAK

Since the early 1970s, those with access to
the media have repeatedly stated that the
youth of this country no longer have any
heroes to admire and emulate.

Gone are the days, these pessimists claim,
when charismatic figures such as Will Rog-
ers, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, J.
Edgar Hoover and John F. Kennedy awed
America's youth with their larger-than-life
appearances. I say not so—I see many mod-
ern heroes, and, although they are scaled-
down versions of those of yore, they still set
quite an example for this country's young
people. As proof of their existence, I offer a
list of a few modern-day heroes.

0 Alan Alda: Star of M*A*S*H and
pseudo-feminist. Unofficial sources say he
plans to run for God.

0 Anita Bryant: Religious divorcee whose
work to cure homosexuals (and Save Our
Children) caused her to be martyred by the
Florida Orange Juice Company.

0 Jesse Helms: Senator from North Carol-
ina. Valiant defender of the tobacco industry
and reigning monarch of the New Right.

0 Andy Kaufman: a humorless little man
who makes a successful living by imperson-
ating a stand-up comic.

0 Bill Moyers: Commentator for the CBS
Evening News. -Known as the Conscience of
America, he will be a write-in candidate
against Alda. ,

O Phyllis Schlaﬂey: Happily married ERA
combatant who traverses the country telling
women they belong at home—on pedestals.

0 Brooke Shields: Sultry teenage pin-up
for the American Cancer Society and Calvin
Klein’s denim goddess.

0 James Watt: Secretary of What’s Left of
the Interior. To the delight of the Reagan
Administration and the applause of the oil
companies, he is successfully dismantling his
department from the top down.

These men and women are today’s heroes,
the role models for the youth of the 1980s.
Admittedly, none of them can hold a candle

song.

After watching a few more “video” songs,
I muttered something to my friends about
having to study for a test‘ and left, dazed
from having turned into a speechless zombie
for over 15 minutes. Little did I know that it
would happen again and again in the future.

MTV (Music Television) and, intelligent
conversationare like General Khadaffi and
sane humans—polarized. As soon as MTV
is turned on at a party or while two or three
people are talking, the conversation stops
for as long as the “video” music is on. Flash-
ing colors, rapidly changing scenes and the
blatant surrealism of video music overpow-
ers the rational-seeking side of our sensa-
tions. In other words, we become (in the
terms of a contemporary critic of television)
“vidiots.”

Why is MTV so popular among college‘

students? Does MTV act as a powerful
relaxant? Well, it seems _t_o; just as all of
television does in general. Unfortunately,
MTV also inhibits conversation to such a
degree that I know of people who sit in front
of their televisions watching MTV all night,
doing and saying practically nothing.

In many ways MTViis a form of social
control that is even more perverse than regu-
lar television programming. Mothers often
pacify their children by placing them in front
of the television while cartoons or cop shows
are on. We pacify ourselves by sitting in
front of MTV. If MTV stimulated the imagi-
nation, it might not be so bad. In fact, MTV
does just the opposite; it does the “imagin-

Loan

Appﬁcaﬁon
Charged

Several colleges have begun to
charge students fees when they

apply for federal loans because

of the growing costs associated
with processing Guaranteed Stu-
dent Loans.

College officials say that the

extra income is needed because»

state and institutional support
for many financial aid offices has
not kept pace with the increase in
paperwork involved in handling
loan forms. And, although the
practice is limited to only a few
institutions, many large, public
universities are considering fol-
lowing suit.

Guaranteed loans are made by
commercial lenders after a col-
lege has first certified that the
student is eligible to apply. This

’ _ has become, a time-consuming

procedure since more loan appli-
cations have been ﬂooding in in
recent years.

Those who oppose the fee have
argued that administrative costs
should not be passed to needy
students who must already pay
state loan-guarantee agencies up
to one percent of the amount
borrowed and another -five per-
cent that is charged to reduce the
program's cost to the federal
government.

SATScores

Decrease

Fewer students have been.

scoring at high levels on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test, and
this could pose a problem for col-
leges and universities that are on
the lookout for such students.
The number of students who
have been scoring at high levels
on the verbal and mathematics
sections of the SAT has been on
the decline over the last decade,
according to an analysis by Stan-
ford University. The dean of
Stanford admissions, Fred Har-

gadon, presented his findings at a ,

recent meeting of the Stanford
Academic Council.

More evidence that the
number of students performing
at high levels has been declining
came in a report issued by the
National Assessment of Educa-
tional Progress. The report
noted that in math and science,
the “performance of American
youth declined during the
l970s.” ' '

According to Hargadon’s
study, in the years from 1972 to
1982, the number of students
who scored higher than 650 on
the verbal section fell by 45 per-

- cent while mathematics saw a

decrease of 23 percent. '

Maybe it has become routine? Fill
in the right numbers and the picture
will turn out ﬁne.

The numbers looked the same: a
sellout crowd of 6,180 and then
some, a visiting team ranked in the
Top 20, Clyde Vaughan’s hitting for
his bankable 22 points...but the
Panther basketball team Eouldn’t

the fate of Pitt’s last five home-floor
opponents, leaving the Fitzgerald
Field House with a 70-52 victory.

The 18 point stomping was the
worst the Panthers have suffered
since the early season folly against
Villanova, and the- 10 for, 40 shoot-
ing display put on by the Panthers in
the second half mayhave been their
worst ever. _

P
. Lgpset, and the sleeper of the Big East

By BARRY ZASLOFF

The crowd burned itself out while
coaxing the Panthers into turning‘
the normal pre-game layup routine
into a slam dunk exhibition. At
about the same time, Pitt saw its
chances of another in a string of
upsets at Fitzgerald Field House les-
soned considerably.

The scene: Pitt players were trying
to out-dunk each‘ other about 10
minutes before game time. The fans
were making perhaps as much noise

Matt Miklasevich almost tore apart
this arm on an attempted rimshaker.
Joey David had a nice two-handed
reverse stuff. The crowd roared.
Boston College, meanwhile, was
practicing its layups. They reacted
with a stare every once in awhile, as
if to say, “Better save it for the game,
boys.” ‘

as they would the rest of the night."

said. “We shouldn't be shooting the
ball 76 times.”

Vaughan, who had been saving
his heroics for the second half most
of this season, came out sizzling, fin-
ishing up the first 20 minutes with 18
points and eight rebounds. But
Vaughan reminded us that nobody
plays 40 minutes of Big East basket-
ball every night without tiring as the
junior forward hit on only 2 for 10 in
the second half. Vaughan had to be
helped off the court due to severe leg
cramps midway through the half,
but he returned a couple of minutes
later, finishing the night with a sea-
son high 17 rebounds.

“I think they tired him out,” Chip-
man said. “The thing that’s killing us
is that we aren’t getting any post
play. Our two forwards are killing
themselves to rebound the
basketball.” . -

Pitt managed to squeeze only
three points and five rebounds out of
its new dualing centers Andre Willi-
ams and Matt Miklasevich. .

Pitt was having too much fun.
Miklasevich missed another, this
time almost separating his ankle
from his leg.‘_Another two-hander
for David. Again, thecrowd roared.
Then came about 10 other variations
of the dunk.

Then came the game. Pitt may
now wish that it had saved some
energy (not to mention dunks). Bos-
ton College slammed the Panthers
to the ground, 70-52, in front of
6,180 onlookers.

Now, it was the Eagles‘ center
John Garris slamming three sky

passes through the basket. Garris‘
» totaled 19 points and 12 rebounds in

the game.

Now, it was David missing shots
by rather large margins. He was 2 for
ll, scoring just four points in 22
minutes. i

Now, it was Miklasevich doing
perhaps as little as one can do in 17

Boston College Soars To 70-52

Panthers Find Birds In Hand
Not Worth Win At Home

Boston College got double the
play from their two big men, 6-10
junior Jay Murphy and 6-8 senior
John Garris. Garris looked like
another great Boston center—Phil
Esposito—as he camped out in the
lane laying in easy shots and throw-
ing down alley-oop passes on his
way to a team high 19 points.

“He’s hurt us twice now more than
any other big man in the league,-”
Chipman said of Garris.

_Murphy was fouled as he made a
layup off a steal at 7:42 of the first
half, and his foul shot put the Eagles
up by three and they never looked
back. Murphy hit two jumpers to

It was Boston ,.Col1ege’s turn to
give the rims a workout. It was Pitt's
chance to watch. The Panthers’ﬁnal
dunk came about five minutes
before the game began. And that’s
about the same time the crowd’s last

“We came out playing hard, but . '

when the ball wouldn’t go in, we got
discouraged,” Pitt coach Roy Chip-
man said afterward. “You can’t beat
anyone shooting the way we did
tonight." '

Even Pitt forward Clyde Vaughan
had an off shooting night, connect-
ing on just 11 of 27 shots. He lasted

through the pre-game show, scored -

22 points——l8 in the first half—and
grabbed 17 rebounds. Boston Col-
lege, quite understandably, had him
worn to the hardwood floor by
game’s end.

The Panther volleyball team is '

into trends. Discounting its early
start in January, the team has been

winning a few matches, then losing a,

few. After venturing into New Jersey
this past weekend, Pitt continued
their off-and-on style of play.

The Panthers had an easy time
against East Stroudsburg Friday
night, walloping the Warriors, l5-
l0, 15-13”, 15-2. The trend of win-
ning, followed by the losing became
clear Saturday when Rutgers con-
tinued its mastery over Pitt, l5-l2,
6-l5, l5-l2, 15-7, 15-5. Pitt has
failed to exit victorious from the
Scarlet Knights’ home court the last
five years.

Perhaps hindering him some-
what, Pitt coach Ray Reilly had to
once again refer to that inexpe-
rienced label that was plastered over
the team like a postmark right from
the season‘s start.

“We were in the Rutgers match,

the whole way..Ijust think it's a case ‘

of a young team not ready to beat
that old-established team," Reilly
explained. “I couldn’t say Rutgers
was a typical match—it’s typical of a
young team like ours in that we got
to the fifth game, and just weren’t
mentally tough enough to walk
away with it.” .

Senior Dave Baird acknowledged
that there may have been an added
factor in the loss to Rutgers. He is,
however, unwilling to shove all the
blame over Pitt's losing onto poor
officiating.

“Last year we took Rutgers to five
games,” the two-time All-East setter
said. “It’s tough to beat them there,
because they got a lot of help from
the referees.

“That really wasn’t that big a fac-
tor, though,” Baird added. “Overall,
(the referees) were favorable, but
that’s no excuse....We just weren't
consistent; they played well the last
two games.”

Indeed, the Panthers took the

Knights .to five games for the second .

able to put away the victory. As
Baird had earlier said, “We played
well in the first (game), played off in
the second, played well in the third.”

Even the match was fairly sym-
bolic of the Panthers’season to date:
trendy. ~\

When Pitt is playing “on" volley-
ball, it’s fluid passing is just about
unstoppable. The»East Stroudsburg
match was indicative enough of that /
type of sure-ﬁre play that will earn
the freshmen-dominated team more
wins than losses.

“We were serving excellently
against Stroudsburg,” Reilly said.
“We took them out of a lot of their
offense—a lot of quick stuff on the

to do; that was the key.”

Why Reilly’s squad could not
carry over this masterful type of
game might be equated to unlocking,
the secret of the key to more youth-
ful life. The team’s inexperience,
again, might be considered. Or,

Wrestlers Finish 6th Despite Jelic’s 2nd EWL Titlegﬁg

By TIM DINEGER

Jeff Jelic was the only Panther to ‘

qualify for the national tournament
by winning his second Eastern Wres-
tling League (EWL) title at I58 lbs.
this weekend at Clarion.

Pitt as a team came in sixth, while
Penn State won the team champion-_
ship, qualifying eight wrestlers for
nationals.

“I thought we could have done
better,” wrestling coach Rande Stet-
tlemyer said. “I wanted to take at
least 3 guys to nationals, but we only
have one.

“Jeff did a super job. He beat‘peo-
ple who had beaten him during the
year. He still isn’t at his peak yet, but
we hope to get him ready over the
‘next two weeks.”

Jelic went into the tournament
with a third seed, but was still consi-
dered a favorite to win the EWL
crown. '

In the opening round, Jelic faced
sixth seeded Kurt Anderson of West
Virginia. Jelic routed Anderson 17-2
to move into the semi-finals- against

Clarion’s Nate Carter. Last week,
Jelic wrestled Carter in the dual
meet, and Carter pulled out an 8-7
win. -

This time, however, Jelic scored
an easy _6-3 victory. Jelic scored
takedowns in the first and second
periods, and an escape in the second.
Riding time gave Jelic the extra
point. Carter's only scoring came on
a pair of escapes and a penalty point
against Jelic for illegally locking his
legs. '
In the finals, Jelic met up with first
seeded Doug Buckwalter of Lock
Haven. It was another avenging
match for Jelic because earlier in the
season, Buckwalter had knocked
him off in the dual meet 4-2. But
once again Jelic came out on top 6-3
to capture his second straight title
and second trip to the national

‘ tournament.

“I’m not putting any pressure on
Jeff," Stottlemyer said. “He's a good
wrestler and he knows what he can
do. We’re going out there [Okla-
homa] to find out.” ’

volleyball is no joke.

“There was no carry-over (from
one match to the next),” Reilly
recalled, “because of the dominance
that Rutgers has had the last five
years. That’s tough to get out of your
head; you see that over the years,
and my younger players know how
awesome Rutgers is, then all of a
sudden they get in the match and
, ‘Oh my gosh, here we are.’
 “We played well against
(Rutgers). We really did. It's just a
matter of the inexperience beating
us right now.” '

That’s where junior Mike Petock
hit the nail on the head.

4

“Against Rutgers I thoughtwe
beat ourselves,” he said. “We kept
getting stuck at seven for a while, at
10 for a while, we just couldn’t keep
pushing forward to get the next
point....We just didn’t play well
enough to beat them.

“We’re sort of a team that has to
play well enough to beat them——we
can’t lay down and just cruise
through to wait for things to
happen?’

Good point. However, Pitt’s 12-9-
1 match record might lead some to
believe that the team’s players are
only ready for matches when the
motivation hits them. Reilly quickly

Panther G ymnasts
Break Record

y PETE I. MADAUS

In the world of gymnastics, most
formidable powers have trouble
excelling over meek opponents. But
not the Panthers.

The Panther gymnastics team had

.no difficulty downing the Slippery
Rock Rocketts last Thursday night
by a score of 271.5 to 232.85. In the
process of boosting their record to
10-1, the Panthers broke the pre-
vious school record of 269.75.

Leading the way for the Panthers
was freshman Mark Klafter. Klafter

‘captured first on the rings with a

_ gore-of 9.2. He also won the all-

‘round, compiling a score of 54.5
and creeping up on the school record

--.1 ....<.>.f.5.4-9,=.. _

)IaElN\i€)NIS2InN

 

Junior Dave Smith, with his
thundering tumbling and precision
execution, won the floor exercise
with a score of 9.65.

The side horse was won by senior
Mike Lloyd scoring an outstanding
9.2, and junior Frank Lratz lead all
opponents in the vault, scoring 9.5.

Freshman Matt Peters had a suc-
cessful day,“ tying for first in the high
bar with sophomore Ed Miller (9.45)
and winning the parallel bars with a
9.0. '

The Panthers’ next meet is at West
Point, N.Y., Saturday, March 5,
where they face the Cadets of Army.
The Panthers defeated Army earlier
this year at the Farmingdale Open,
but nevertheless, they are armed and
ready for a battle.

NURSING WEEK

disagrees, pointing out that his sche-
dule for the season is the most
demanding in five years.

He also had several players drop
off from last year‘s squad—all due to
different reasons. And, Reilly will
say, he never would have scheduled
so stringent a schedule had be
known in advance that six of the
roster’s 10 players would be
freshman. . -

“These guys are into heavy com-
petition,” Reilly said. “But they
aren’t quitting, they’re holding
tough.” .

When also asked if this team is
somewhat stuck in quicksand, and
swaying back and forth from win to
loss, Petock attributed the heavy
burden of the schedule’s compo-
nents to a near -.500 record.

“I think it’s just the way the sche-
dule- is set up,” the third year outside
hitter said. “We’ll play a team we
know we should beat like Edinboro
or East Stroudsburg, one out of our
caliber, and then we play a team that
we know we have to play well to

beat. 4

“I wish I knew the problem,
because I want to start winning as
much as we’re supposed to win.”

The mystery problem surfaced
quite evidently, as Petock pointed
out, against Rutgers. “(After we
forced them) into a lot of mistakes
and won pretty easily (against
Stroudsburg), this couldn’t carry

over because we’ve never beaten.

Rutgers before. So, I think that
there’s a little aura surrounding their
team——it was a difficult game to
describe.”

GAME SERVES: Just about the
only enjoyable aspect of the week-
end, Reilly said, was the plane trip to
New Jersey. Actually cheaper than
driving the;e, the ﬂight was the first
in thew history of the program

NURSING WEEK

....Reilly declined to say that the
squad’s win over East Stroudsburg
came easily, although the game
scores may indicate otherwise:
“Stroudsburg is a very well-coached
team. Bob Sweeney is in his seventh
year and should be a lot tougher by
the end of the year. As a matter of
fact, they did beat George Mason
last week in a five-game match."
That was the same Patriot team

that crushed Pitt last weekend a__t__
Trees Hall, in four games....Despite
opinion to the contrary, both Petock
and Reilly believe that the moun-
tainous schedule the Panthers are
plowing through is only to benefit a .
team that will probably be stronger
by season's finale, when it counts
most. Said Petock, “It’s all a learn-
ing experience. It gives the freshmen
playing, experience.”

Other Panthers to fair well at the
tournament were Joe Throckmor-
ton (134 lbs.), who placed third,

’ Gary Bolin (142 lbs.) and Eric Wertz

Throckmorton was seeded third

In the semi-finals, Throckmorton
met old rival Mark Ciccarello of
Clarion, One weekend ago, Cicca-

the dual meet match-up, but this
week, he eased past the Panther cap-
tain 17-9, dropping Throckmorton

Lady Panthers’ Early Scoring Overcomes Rutgers

By LAURIE I(UBLl

“We’ll be tough to beat," Coach
Judy Saurer said after the Lady

Panther ‘basketball team defeated

Rutgers—a team Pitt has never
before defeated—Saturday night at
Fitzgerald Field House, 75-68.
Saurer was referring to her team's
trip to Providence, R.I., for the Big
East championships this coming
weekend. , ’

“I can't say for sure, of course—
there are games being played tonight
[Saturday] that may have a bearing
on the seeding at the tournament-
but we'll probably be seeded third,

behind Providence and St. John’s,’’ ’

she said. “We could be playing Syra-
cuse or Seton‘ Hall.”

_ Execution and board control
keyed the Panther victory.

“We set the tone by scoring 42
points in the first half, working the
ball in to Jennifer Bruce and Pam
Miklasevich,” Saurer said. “Either
of these two players can take on_,any-
one, one-on-one.

“Our rebounding also played an
important part in controlling the
pace of the game.”

Bruce was the leading scorer and
rebounder with 23 points and 17
rebounds, while teammate Miklase-
vich scored 20 and had 8 boards.

Pitt ran into trouble in the early
going, taking the lead just once in
the first 10 minutes of the game, and
was down. by seven at the ll:53
mark. The Lady Panthers charged
back and took the reins on a driving
layup by sophomore Becky Mazi-
arz, who contributed a 10-point,
ﬁve-rebound effort. '

“Becky really did a good job,”
Saurer said. “She and the other
guards handled the ball well, coming

in to replace [Kim] Tirik, who really -

wasn't feeling well. As a matter of
fact, we’re lucky she played at all.”

Freshman Kim Gannis came off
the bench to make the shot from the
top of the key that gave the Lady
Panthers their biggest lead of the
game, 10 points, with just under five
minutes left in the half.

“Everybody did a great job,”
Saurer said, “especially coming off
the bench. Gannis, Lynn Love, Ste-
phanie Collins—everyone contri-
buted.” I

The Scarlet Knights, however,
battled back to within two points of
the home team with 1:50 remaining
in the first half, 36-34. It was as close
as Rutgers would get; Pitt scored six
points to take an eight-point lead
into the locker room, 42-34.

“The shooting percentages were
the difference,” according to Saurer.

Pitt shot 58.9 percent from the field
in the first half, while Rutgers hit on
only 37.5 percent.

“In .the second half, we didn't
shoot as well,” Saurer said. “Pam
[Miklasevich] threw a couple of
bricks. I think she and the rest of the
team were getting tired.”

Rutgers again drew first blood as
Lorrie Lawrence opened the second
half with a double-pump layup, and
within minutes, the Scarlet Knights
had tied the score 45-45.

Although the Scarlet Knights
never took the lead, Pitt never led by
more than seven.

Both teams used the full-court
press, and one of the reasons Pitt
was able to maintain a lead was 6-
foot sophomore Ellen Gilhooley.

“Ellen did a terrific job bringing
the ball up the court, which Tirik
usually does," Saurer said. “She beat
the press, not turning the ball over.”

Twice in the last three and one-
half minutes, Rutgers made it a one-

point game on scores by Lawreneé,’7

and the second time there was only
1:58 to play. It was a l4-footjumper
by Lawrence that. brought the
Knights clo_se,,but Pitt put the game
away with a layup from Bruce and
two free throws each from Miklase-
vich and Tirik.

The Lady Panthers finished the
regular season 17-10, 5-3 in the Big
East. ' ~

The team will leave for the Big
East tournament Wednesday and.
Saurer believes her team will play'e§J
Friday. .

“We’ll have to minimize turnovers
and not force the shots,” she said.
“We need to maintain our endur-
ance, which is why I cancelled prac-
tice the day after Villanova—we
didn‘t get back until 4 a.m. If we
continue playing the way we have
been, we should come out in good
shape.” V

Runners Slowed By In/uries

By CHARLIE O'HARA

\

This past weekend, the Panther
track team placed second in a quad

‘meet at West Virginia. The host

school won the meet with 69 points,
followed by Pitt with 51 and North

. Carolina and Kent State, who '

scored 20 points each.

The Panthers were without the
services of distance runners Todd
Colas and Terry Gallagher, both of
whom were nursing minor injuries.

“We lost a lot not having Terry or
Todd,” head coach John Vasvary
said. “The meet would have been a
lot more competitive had we been
able to run everybody. But I don’t
want to make excuses.”

Despite these problems, several
fine performances were turned in by
the Panthers. Junior Bill Moorhead

won the 1500-meter run and placed
second in the I000-meter run with
times of 3:52.17 and 2:26.44 respec-
tively. Moorhead qualiﬁed for the
lC4A (Intercollegiate Amateur
Athletic Association of America)
track championship, which will be
held March 5-6, in both events.

Brain Pollock won the 500-meter
run in 1:04.39, also qualifying for the
IC4As while Rich Baderinwa, Ralph
Mitton and Roger Kingdom were
the only other Panther winners in
the 400-meter run, the triple jump
and the 55-meter hurdles‘
respectively.

Even though Rick Asberry ﬁn-
ished second in the 55-meter dash,
the senior broke a school record,
running the event with a time of
6.37.

Other top finishers came from
Bob Buczkowki, (second in the shot

during the 800-meter run), the two-

“He was tired,” Chipman said of
Vaughan. “They just tired him
down. We’re not getting any post
play...both of my forwards are kil-
ling themselves trying to rebound."

Pitt got no dunks, either. In fact, it

‘ had difficulty reaching the rim. The

Eagles swatted no fewer than six
Panther shots away from the basket.
On numerous other occasions, Pitt
attempts barely grazed the steel. The
Panthers converted on only 24 of 76
shots, just under 32 percent.

By SARA STRICKLAND

The Lady Panther gymnasts lost’

to the Lady Gators of Floria 176.55-
168.85 Friday night at Trees Hall.
Karen Martin, with an excellent
all-around score of 35.35, placed
second behind Florida’s Elfie
Schlegel. Individually, Martin
shared second place on uneven bars

~_ }.%..with a 9.05. She also scored an 8.85

on balance beam, placing her third
in that category.

Despite a badly pulled leg muscle,
senior Babbie Flock accumulated a

_re_s_pectablc all-around score of 34.4,

The Field Housemagic, which
had brought Pitt upset victories over
St. Johns,'Syracuse and George-

town in recent weeks, disappeared
into Boston College’s red outfits.
The crowd noise, which in those pre-
vious upsets had threatened to raise
the Field House roof, was relegated
to an occasional outburst.

“We just couldn’t get the ball in
the basket,” Chipman said. “We
didn't let the crowd get into the

game.”
Boston College didn't help mat-
ters. It played like a team capable of

placing her fifth. A score of 9.0
placed Flock fourth in vaulting and
an 8.9 helped her secure third place
on the unevens behind Martin.
Senior Gretchen Speich added
strength to the Panther lineup with
her consistent performance. She
placed sixth in the all-around with a
score of 33.45. --
Sophomore Debbie Dabkowski
and freshman Jackie Calderone also
excelled. Executing a fine routine on
unevens, Dabkowski took fourth
with a score of 8.8. Calderone con-
tributed to Pitt's vaulting total by
scoring an 8.65 on a handspring f_ull
vault. . ' _
The Lady Panthers were counting

winning the upcoming Big East-
Tournament, a team ranked in the
Top 20. '

“They certainly were ready for
us,” Chipman said. “Even when we‘

were ahead‘ early, I wasn’t‘happy
with- the way that the game was
going. It was far too uptempo for
us." - .

And as Chipman departed from
the crowd of reporters, he said, “24
of 76; _I could probably shoot that
good.” 8
' But can he dunk the ball?_

on scoring l70.00.

“We need to keep our average
high." Pitt coach Donna Sanft said.
‘‘It is necessary that we score 170 in

. our two remaining meets so we can

quality for regionals.”

The Lady _ Panthers’ remaining
meets against Ohio State and Clar-
ion will be challenges.

“It gets tough toward the end of
the season, but we seem to be
improving with every meet. I think
we can quality for regionals," Speich
said.

“It is now just mind over matter,”
said senior Babbie Flock. “We can
do it.”

» The_ Pitt News, Monday, February 28, 1983- . :

Panthers Can’t Find Key

continued from page eleven

sion cameras or wait for Tiger Paul’s
antics instead of giving the team any
kind of lift. ,

“I thought we did a good job of
controlling the crowd,” Boston Col-
lege head coach Gary Williams said.
“We hit the big shots to keep the
crowd out of the game.”

Another Adams breakaway fol-
lowed by a jump shot from the
corner by the 5-10 sophomore built
the Eagle lead to 17 and the Fitzger-
ald fair-weather fans started to file
out with more than five minutes
remaining in the game.

Williams continued to tighten the
grip on Big East coach of the year
honors in this his first season with
the Eagles who lifted their record to
20-5 overall and l0-4 in the Big East
conference.

“We felt we needed number 20,"
Williams said. “This puts us in good
position for an NCAA bid. There
just aren’t many teams in the coun-
try with 20 wins."

The Panthers, however, may have

seen their post-season tournament
hopes dashed after Tuesday’s loss at
Seton Hall and the defeat here.
Panther guard Billy Culbertson
remained optimistic, though, after-
wards in a quiet Pitt locker room.
“We definitely got our butts
kicked,” Culbertson said. “l3-l2
isn’t good by any standards, [but] we
can still go to the tournament.”
Before they can get there, the
Panthers have to weather two road
games, tonight at Providence and
Saturday at St. Johns. Fatigue may
have set in on the Panther’s trio of
workhorses—Vaughan, Culbertson
and senior Trent Johnson.
“Maybe we are emotionally
tired,” Culbertson said. “I thought
that we would have played a lot
tougher as it was senior appreciation
night.” _
“They are just better than we are,”
Chipman said. “They wore us down,
and they didn’t let the crowd influ-
ence the way they played.”
When asked about the prospects
of facing his first losing season ever,
Chipman said, “I’m more concerned

about our getting untracked.”

‘Head coaches could probably
come up with easier ways to regain
their team's composure than on the
road in the Big East, but as Culbert-
son said afterwards, they really have
no choice now, do they?

PANTHER NOTES: The Panthers
are now 6-8 in the Big East stand-
mgs, still in sixth place in the confer-
ence race ahead of Providence, U.
Conn. and Seton Hall....Vaughan’s
22 points marks his 39th consecutive
game scoring in double-

figures....Senior Trent Johnson was '

honored before the game as part of
the senior night activities....The only
other Panther to score in double-
figures was Culbertson who contrib-
uted 10 points....He also dished off7
ass1sts....The sellout crowd of 6,180

was the Panthers’ fourth straight at ~

the field house and sixth of the sea-
son....Tonight’s game will be the Big
East game of the week and will be
broadcast on both ESPN and
WPTT (Channel 22).
