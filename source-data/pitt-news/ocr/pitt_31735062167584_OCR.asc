‘King Arthur, J r.”

by MICHAEL EDELSTEIN
Staff Writer

We sat around the large table
talking of the need for interna-
tional peace, how our nation
should not get involved in the
affairs of other distant nations,
and about our need for construct-
ing a Utopia at home. Taking a
puff at his fat cigar, the smoke

oouring from his lips blurring ,
his red and black polkadot bow

tie, King Arthur, Jr. summed up
his un-Camelot like position,
“We can’t be world saviors; we
must be an example" to the
world.”

In a news conference and a
personal interview prior to his
October 8 talk in the Student»
Union, Arthur M. Schlessinger,
Jr. elaborated on this position.

Our problems stem in part
from the fact that we have “the
most imcompetent. administra-
tion that we’ve had for a long-'
time.” the Eisenhower adminis-

tration also being cited in this

category. “Neither have made,
sensible appointments, or stuck,

’ to decisions; they’r'e either" so

lazy or incompetent that they

I ‘ can’t make government work.”

Case in point is the Hayns-
worth Supreme Court nomination,
which has made Republican
senators furious at Nixon because
they so actively opposed Fortas

_ ' on a similar issue. The Nixon
 appointment of Carl C. Turner

as Chief U.S. Marshall was an-

‘- other Fawx pax, as Turner’s re-

cent testimony on his involve-

vrnent in massive military swin-

dles.

The Senate, “quite liberal”
compared to the House, has
shown “much more sobriety and
intelligence than the executive”

. in the last few years. While he
T ’cautioned of the senates attempt
‘”-to set a deadline for Vietnam

withdrawal, Schlessinger termed
Nixon’.s call for a continuation
of the moratorium on criticism
of the administration “phony.”

I He added, 5‘If the Nixon admin-

istration continues its present
downward spiral, continuing to

it make’ no progress in Vietnam
and producing higher prices and
' unemployment at the same time,”

the outlook of the Democratic

V _party will look even better. '

-With relation to the Vietnam,

xalbatross, Schlessinger comment-
gged, “There’s no "face-saving way

out of Vietnam, as long as we
, leave a government that can’t

last 24 hours without the U_.S.

.~ If- we had a sensible and compe-
f._"5tent administration, we’d sene-
_ -Averal Harriman back to Paris.”

To make matters worse, our
involvement’ in Southeast Asia
has caused us to allow other
relations to suffer. “Europe,
Latin America and our Soviet
relations are of far more conse-
quences than Africa, the Middle
East and Asia.”

Questioned about U.S._ involve-
ment in the Middle East, the
Aniericans for Democratic Ac-
tion Vice Chairman cautioned
that “the US and USSR can
decide the future of the Middle
East is as wrong as deciding
the future of Southeast Asia.”

concept applies. Because
United States is at the farthest
frontier ‘of industrial change

a unique role to play. “America

It is this very change which

- has created a new atmosphere,

one in which “America’s young
people have become a separate
faction, beleaugered and oppres-
sed.”

Borrowing McCluhan’s analy-

sis, Schlessinger explained the.

growing generation gap on his
transition from mechanical to
electrical society. In addition,
the bespeckled speaker noted
that, while today’s parents grew
up in a world, of depression,
youth live in a time of afflu-
ence.

in Schlessinger’s eyes, youth
have become an important and
powerful faction, as shown by
the McCarthy and McGovern
campaigns. “Politicians take cam-
puses more seriou-sly.” Predict-
ing that the approaching Viet-
nam Moratorium will be “very
effective”, he added, “I’m all
for it.”

While he refused to discount’
any possible Democratic presi-
dential nomination contenders
for 1972, Schlessinger comment-
ed on Ted Kennedy, “he’s been

the nationwide reaction to the

ed, “our country enjoys kicking

BARGAIN  
RELIGIONS

EWELRY MANUFACTURERS do a very proﬁtable business in imita-
tion gold crosses. It’s human nature to hunt for bargains, even
in religious items. That’s why so many people turn to religions
that cost them little, modern cults and isms that offer a com-

iorting sense of God's nearness and do awaylwith the idea of hell
entirely. It is only human to want a religion that de-emphasizes
punishment for sin. However, albargain may have serious hidden
ﬂaws. The thing you buy cheaply often turns out to be worthless.

Genuine Christianity is not a
cheap religion, although many
offer bargains in its name. It was

a critical moment in

RI-ZADIN history when Christ

TIME: had to tell His disci-
2 Minutes ples what His procla-
20 Seconds mation of the truth_

is would cost; Him: cru-
ciﬁxion. Who wants to follow a
defeated leader? Christ’s offer
was, “If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross daily, and fol-‘

’ low me.”

Christianity is a religion of
choice. The consequences of that
choice are clearly set forth in the
Bible. He who chooses Christ‘ is
reconciled with God, born anew,
assured of eternal life. He who.
rejects Christ and chooses to con-.
tinue in the sin of a self-directed
life condemns himself to trouble-.
of soul, divorces himself from re-"
ality and ultimate pur ose, and in
the end suffers eterna loss. Even
the most sophisticated person is

. haunted at some time «by the fear,

What if I wake up after all this

is over and ﬁnd out that I was
wrong?

Yet Christianity is not a reli-
gion of fear but of love. Fear may
drive a man to religion. but re-
ligion will drive fear out of a
man. To love God and be loved by
Him makes heroes out of cowards,
sober men out of alcoholics, re-
sponsible and creative men and
women out » of ﬂoundering, un-
directed, confused human beings.
Christianity is not mere morality,
it is commitment to a person, the
Lord Jesus Christ. The rice isn't
cheap. It cost Christ IS life; it
will" cost you your ego-ﬁlled per-
sonality, your right to self-direc-
tion; it will bring you into oppo-
sition with the world. .

But the cross was followed by
the resurrection. When you take
up the cross and follow Christ,
your feet will be set on a road

.that leads to joy, peace, released

creativity, and relatedness to
what life is all about, here and
hereafter. The Christian life will
cost you something, but it’s
worth it. Its joys surpass its sor-
rows. Try it.

“But ‘how do I come to Christ?” you ask. “Where is He?" Let me

In an art form which has pro-
duced relatively few great prac-
titioners, comparisons of one
artist with others seems to be
inevitable. Yass Hakoshima, the
Japanese mime who will perform
at the SU Ballroom Thursday in
.a lecture demonstration and con-
cert, has created a subtle blend-
ing of Western and Far Eastern
art elements.

Curriculum Change,

I Supplement Lists Courses

by DIANE ULYON
Staff News Writer

Descriptions for those courses which

i have been added to the curriculum and

those courses whose formats have changed
since the last publication of the academic
bulletins will be distributed at the Of-
fice of the Registrar, Student Records,
G-60 CL. The more than one hundred
new courses in the curriculum are de-
scribed in this supplement. It is oped

_ that the supplement will be available for
‘ distribution tomorrow (Wednesday).

Through the, initiative of the Student

it-”,;‘.Government Committee on Academic Pro-
V’-cedures and with the full co-operation of
-A -the University Registrar, Dr. Pete Alls-

house and the chairmen of each academic
department, this supplement has been com-
piled to assist students as they prepare for
Winter Term registration. ,

r_ The descriptions will include courses

“in -the , College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS),and the School of General Studies.
The current academic bulletins for these
schools do not include these courses. It
should be noted that the new bulletin for

.,the CAS will not be available until late

November, after Winter term registration
is completed. _

The undergraduate /academic bulletins
for the other schools are up-to-date and
currently available at the University In-
formation Centers and the Advising Center
on the ninth floor of the Cathedral. 6

The Academic Procedures Committee
is} responsible for initiating the complia-
-tion of these course descriptions. This
committee was created within the Aca-
demic Cabinet of the CAS last year to “re-_
view academic procedures as they effect
the undergraduate schools,” according
to Carl Van Horn, one-of the Committee’s
chairmen.._

A Page 4—THE PITT NEWS—Monday, October 13, 1969

Van Horn explained that the committee
has assumed a more autonomous role
from the Academic Cabinet in the past
year, while still maintaining a work-
ing relationship in areas of common in-
terest.

This year the committee’s chairmen,
Van Horn and Mike Staschak, hope to work
with representatives from all undergrad-
uate schools to gain maximum support for
any projects undertaken. Students inter-
ested in serving on the committee or
chairmen of academics cabinets who
wish to recommend a representative from
their school’s cabinet should contact
Mike Staschak, at 681-6403 as soon as pos-
sible. '

Reporter’s Footnote :$a
As Winter term registration approaches,
we will all once again face the procedural
red-tape of the registration. If seeming-
ly unnecessary problems and confusion

' beset you during the process, don’t keep

your frustration to yourself. The Academic
Procedures Committee is off to a produc-
tive start this year, and it is receptive to
any suggestions about problems to be
tackled to make the registration process
less painful. ’

In addition, the University Registrar,
Dr. Pete Allshouse has been a tremendous
asset to the committee. Dr. Alls-
house has demonstrated his willingness to
assist in planning and -financing any
changes in the procedures‘ which are
more reasonable than those currently fol-,
lowed. -

Refer yourcomplaints or suggestions
to the committee chairmen. Carl Van

4;The ‘Arts and Sciences Review Committee was formed last spring by the Under-

 

graduate" Council of the College. Composed of six faculty members and three stu-
dents, the Committee was charged with re-evaluating the entire C. A. S. undergradu-
ate experience — admissions, curriculum, gradnign, advising center, intra-class '
mechanics, living space, and extra-curricular activities — in short, to study that which
happens to the student from the moment he applies to Pitt to the moment he leaves.

_The faculty Committee members include Professors David Bramhall (Chair-
man) and David Houston, Economics; Barrett Mandel, English; William Loerke, Fine
Arts; _Orlando Taylor, Psychology; and John Towsend, Physics. Student members were

chosen by the Arts and Sciences Student Cabinet and include Michael FalNicant .6

Chairmanof the Cabinet); Everett Bannister, and ‘Ellen Wartella. -

During the year they will be meeting with groups of students, faculty, and other
members of the ,_University community to formulate a concise evaluation of the C.A.S.
_ ):Pitt._ Whatever recommendations are_made during the year, and particularly in
the formal report during the Winter Term, 1970, will be submitted to a series of
groups for approval — first to the Undergraduate Council, then to the F.A.S. Coun-
¢i1,,,,and finally to the entire Faculty of Arts and Sciences for their approval.

Editor, The Pitt News

After a two week shut-down, The Pitt News is back on the streets.

The shut-down resulted when the staff decided that until it received
monetary and academic rewards for itswork, it could not continue to pub-
lish. The shut-down was also supposed to allow the staff decide if students
wanted and needed a campus newspaper. This was to be determined by their
reaction to the shut-down. It was hoped by the staff thatthe students, if
they missed having the campus newspaper, would urge the administration and
other parties to act in obtaining the money and credit the staff wanted be-
fore it continued publishing. 0

Student action was minimal, although staff members received many op-

As far as the money and credit, the staff will receive the $9000 it asked
for as payment for its work in the form of merit scholarships. Thus no prece-
dent will be set whereby other activities on campus who previously were un-
paid must now demand payment. for the staff has received merit scholarships
in the past. Also, a one-credit - per - term seminar will begin in January for
staff members who are interested in journalistic techniques. Presently, there
is only one course offered in journalism, and is limited to upper class stu-
dents. Since the students in this class were at one time sent up to The Pitt
News one hour per week for experience, no precendent was set in this area
either. ~

In addition to these actions, the Student Government Allocations Com-
mittee is going to review its allocation to The Pitt News and a committee
headed by a University -Trustee, Judge Adisert, is going to meet to study the
problems of student publications, an recommend solutions to the financing
of them to the administration.

During the shut-down, Joe Coangelo, head of University News and Pub-
lications and editor of The University Times, agreed to purchase $4000 worth
of subscriptions of the Pitt News for faculty and administrative use.

So," when staff members are asked if they got what they wanted to con-
tinue bpulishing, they must give their opinion. Most staff members feel we
received enough in actual commitments and future promises, while others feel
we should have waited until the promises became commitments before we
continued publication.

No matter what each staff member feels about what we “got” and what
we didn’t “get,” he or she does return to his or her job with the thoughts un-
curred during two weeks of studying, ‘partying, reading, dating, and listen-
ing to their fellow students discuss the good and bad sides of The Pitt News.
This addition to each mind will hopefully add something to the paper, but
more ideas and more bodies are needed. One of the main ideas of the‘ pay-
ment idea was to recruit new members by offering them some small payment
for their efforts. ~ -

You, as our readers, have alwo had two weeks without. the paper to‘
think about its function and purpose and all, and your ideas (although we
V can’t pay you for them) are encouragement.

"Before We Change the World
We Must Learn How to Laugh’

Editor, The Pitt News:

There is a new and vital poli-
tical movement starting today;
it is a movement based upon the
principles of understanding, af-
fection, and care. It is a singul-
arly unique and colorful move-
ment, yet it has no trademarks or
distinguishing features. There is
no way to recognize someone as
one of its members without com-
ing out and asking, “Are you
a member of that movement?”
There are no requirements or
rules.

Unlike all other movements,
this is neither a heart-throb nor
an intellectual game. It is, rath-
er, the conjunction of heart
and mind into a totally non—prag-
matic spiritual exercise.

These are troubled times, and
this is a troubled place. No one
over thirty can be trusted by any-

-insane,

E +Ll c-:.sday~— in/I4.

one under thirty. No one under
thirty can be trusted with any
responsibilities by anyone over
thirty. People are fighting back-
lash and front lash. Leftists and
rightists denounce each other
while moderates denounce both.
The cops jump the freaks and the
freaks jump the cops. Everybody
smokes dope, drops out, gets in-
volved, resists, goes to jail, shoots
smack, dies, rebels, revolts, count-
er-revolts, tries, fails fornicates,
defecates, laughs, cries, grows
beards, grows hair, wishes it
were all over, ends it all, goes
hates, loves, breathes,
seethes, and generally wants to
be home, hiding under the bed,
crying for mommy.

For each hurt, for each discom-
fort. for each stupidity we can
learn to respond with joy and
happiness. This is the essence of
the movement. It is a movement
of joy. It is a movement of gaiety
and happiness and youth. But
most especially, it is a movement
of fun. Yes, a movement of fun.
The politics of Fun!

The Politics of Fun. An exer-
cise in learning how to be three
years old. “There is a little bit
of Peter Pan in each of us,”
wrote James M. Barrie; The Poli-
tics of Fun is an effort to bring
that portion of us out into the
open, to create a world in which
it will be impossible to legis-
late against joy.

I have been told that the
name The Politics of Fun forces
this movement to be too poli-
tical ever to be fun, but I say
that The Politics of Fun is too
much fun ever to be political.

The Politics of Fun makes no
demands of the political inclina-
tions of its members. Its guiding
path can never be marred by
political dissension._We ask and
demand but one thing: that in our

efforts to create a better world

we never forget the joy of laugh-
ter. the spirit of gaiety, the mean-
ing of fun. We must never let
winning become of greater im-
portance to us than having a good
time. If it ever should, we shall
have achieved no more than a
hollow victory.

Through all of recorded history,
man has been devising ways to
make death and destruction more
distant and yet more vonvenient;
now he is finally beginning to
show the first signs of a reason
which, with a tremendous amount
of luck, might just make it pos-
sible for him to survive. The re-
volutionary forces of the world
are finally attempting to unite,
not to divide. They are reaching
for unity. They are striving to
create one strong and vital world.
Yet, what sort of a world can be
founded upon terror and hate?
No, I am not shouting for love; I
am shouting for joy!

For what kind of a world can
we create without a laugh?
Would any one of us like to live
in such a Brave New World?
I think not. George Santayana
wrote: “The young man who
has not wept is a savage, and the
old man who will not laugh is a
fool.’’ These savages and these
fools must be pities, and we
must learn to laugh at ourselves,
and to cry at ourselves as well.
Only then can we set out to seek
a better world. Only then can

we truly have a revolution.

Let each action feel as good as

Let each moment embody all of

joice in living and in learning
to live. Then and only then can
the true revolution be founded.

The revolution is a belly laugh
in the middle of a subway car at
rush hour. It is a meal when you
are hungry. It is a moon on a
quiet beach with the person you
love most. It is learning to stop
fornicating
make love. The refolution is fun.
The Politics of Fun is the revolu-

,;7N_ew Release

by BOB BONN
Staff Writer

 ‘7.October first saw the release of a new
Beatle‘ album. Entitled Abbey Road, it is
one of the group’s best yet. V

excellent cuts on the first side and a long
series of interlocked tunes on the second
side. i j

 . Side one of the disk contains six songs,
-ea‘ch7 great in its own way. The first, “Come
.'_I'ogether,” appears to be,a pace-setter.
Its‘ beat" and harmony are _almost haunting,
and this style is likely to be copies by
other artists in the future.

 George Harrison’s “Something” is the
’ ‘second song. The other Beatles have said
thatgthey consider it the best,on. the al-

 
     
    
   
   
   
     
  
  

 Harrison, incidentally, has been
spending a lot of time with Bob Dylan on
lErigland’s Isle of Wight, and ‘this com-
inunication may. influence his music a
great- deal in.futur_e compositions.

The number three song is “Maxwell’s
Silver Hammer,” and it almost reminds
the listener of “Bungalow Bill” on the pre-
vious Beatle release. This one is a spoof
on the jet-set society sort of person.

“OhP Darling” is written in the style
of the early soul era. Lead singer Paul
McCartney pulls off a successful little
joke as he imitates the Sam Cooke sound,
and the whole cut is actually funny.

Ringo Starr tries his hand at singing
and composing the next song, “Octopus’s

-Garden.” The melody is catchy, but one

wonders if Ringo ever really left his yel-
low submarine. ~ T

A seven-minute song concludes the

first side of “the disk. Entitled"‘I Want

You (She’s So Heavy)/’ it is a medley of.

two songs. The “I Want You” part is good
blues, but the highlight is the “She’s So
Heavy” portion. It’s a repeatingjmelody

that just seems to go on andon and en-,

grosses the listener more and more with
eacy cycle. And just as it becomes to-
tally surrounding, it’s sharply cut off in the
middle of a beat. It rates as’ one of the
best cuts.

The xecond side, as mentioned, be-
fore, leads the listener from childlike
innocence to experience. Harrison’s “Here
Comes the Sun” begins the journey’. Mus-

ically, “Here Comes, ‘the sun” soundsf,

 

exactly like what one would expect a song
with_such a title to sound like.

“Becau'se,”‘ sung in choirboy fashion,

contains such classif lines as,“because the
world is round, it turns me on” and‘ “be-

‘ cause the sky is blue, it makes me cry.”

The first little crisis in the odyssey oc-
curs in “You Never Give Me Your Money.”
It’s an abstract story that tells of first at-
tempts at love, life and independence; and
the subsequent failures. - V

“Sun King” serves as a short interlude
in the series. It’s a happy, warm song
sung in two languages (English and
Italian). '

Bad experiences: come back in the next
two songs, “Mean Mr; Mustard” and

“Ploythene Pam.” The first of these nasty -

characters is a mean old cheapskate who
“who carries a ten-buck note up his
nose”_ and yells obscene words at the
Queen. Polythene Pam is a teenybopper,
yea, yea, yea.’ i ' ~ - _

Other ‘short selections are “She Came
in Through the Bathroom Window,” a rock-
blues number, and “Golden Slumbers,”

 which\is probably the loudes, most un- 7

soothing lullabye ever written; Y
.“Carry That Weight”. ties" the -songs on

prise of earlier‘ songs as wellas a short

Vida”«beat. T . 4 A

“The End” sums up ‘all the experiences
with a. highly moralized ending that sounds
like a Grimm Brothers fairy tale: “And
in theend, the love you take is.equal to
the love you make.” Of course, a group
can’t leave its audience with an ending
that strong, so perched on the end is a
25-second ditty which calls Her Majesty
“a pretty nice girl.” ~

The entire album is musically superb.
John Lennontwas quoted as saying that
the Beatles were more together during
this album’s recording-session that they had
been for at long time. It certainlyyshows,
especially in Starr’s drums,
rhythm guitar, and McCartney’s bass.
And the album is almost entirely without

- electronic effects which sometimes tend ‘

to make the music sound overdone. A
All in all, Abbey Road rates as one of
the Beatles’ very best. And that is very
good indeed. ‘ =

Moratorium: 1. a legally authorized period. of delay in the performance of
a legal obligation or the payment of a debt
2. a suspension of activity; _a temporary ban on the use or pro-
duction of something. TT
If you take apart a phrase like “Vietnam Moratorium” and break it down into
objective word definitions, it becomes removed and impersonal. T Put it together
again, and the phrase takes on connative meaning and picks up emotional charge.‘
To more and more people in this country, the meaning of “Vietnam Moratorium
is becoming charged with similar emotions. ’ ’

peaceful demonstration

The University of Pittsburgh Committee
for the moratorium endorses the descript-
ion of the national moratorium day as pub-
lished by the New York Times:

“The Oct. 15 Vietnam moratorium, in-
spired and organized by students with the

committment

that one does not kill if his heart forbids it
even if the cause be an inconvenient war‘of
the protection of the American image.

Idea-commitment transcends the super-
ficial games that threaten to warp'it,‘but
only if the individual himself can see what
he is doing with his life. Idea-commitment
is no more and no less than self-comm~it—:
ment.

But ah, words again. Words fight the
wars‘; people, are merely the instruments
and the victims. The words communism,
capitalism, patriotism, nationalism stand

behind the soldiers and carry the bullets to._.

their marks.

Revolution is also a word. Many times
revolution substitutes one power structure
for another, while the lives of the people do
not change for the better in any real degree.

And what else is there? What else is
there but the basic freedoms-, such a‘sthe
basic freedom to live without fear?

The Cuban revolution has been touted as
a great victory of the people. But there are
still a large number of unhappy, suffering

people existing in concentration camps or ,
forbidden to practice their religion.

A war of words has triumphed, ideas
have not.

American soldiers are dying in THE WAR
because their government has committed
itself to vaguely defined concepts. How-
ever, these concepts have not protected

the Vietnamese people from the dangers.

and realities of starvation, violence, fear
and confusion.

What are we doing?

 erI?}'-'Divisi9!!;,

support of faculty members has turned from

a localized protest of the campus into a
broad-based and stirring national appeal
for peace.” —

“The developmentgives the lie to those .

who claim that only disruption and violence
are effective in the effort to achieve reform
and that the only thing that can make itself
heard in this democracy is force.”

 . . ...it (the October 15 movement)

has the additional benefit of taking the peace ‘

‘issue away from ‘those who abuse it for
their own ulterior motives. It is at last re-
establishing between campus and public
that essential bond of trust and,understan-
ding.”

The local plans for the University and for
the entire city that have been made by the
groups organizing the moratorium in Pitts-
burgh reflect this position. The organizers

' have madeplans to deal with any kind of

foreseeable violence that might occur and
disavows all forms of violence in regard to

Vietnam: W b.

by BILL GORMLEY
Staff News Writer

Vietnam’s strategic location, fertile
territory, and mineral resources have
been curses as well as blessings. Richly
endowed by nature and nestled conven-
iently between the sea and the Asian
mainland, Vietnam has inevitably been
eyed lustfully by mightier nations and
has sound freedom an elusive ideal.

In 111 B.C., Vietnam was annexed by
China, her powerful northern neighbor.
Submitting for a millenium, the Viet-
namese finally rebelled against their
masters, bringing Chinese hegemony to
an end in 939 A.D. Except for a brief
period during which the Chinese resumed
control, Vietnam remained independent
for over 900 years.

During the latter half of the’ 19th
century, however, western nations pro-
ceeded to bear their share of “the white
man’s burden.”France, with little dif-
ficulty, colonized Vietnam. Although
some Vietnamese physically resisted the
French and later harassed French soldiers
and officials, most Vietnamese felt impo-
tent before the European giant.

Rise of Nationalism

Conditions changed, though, as the
20th century ushered in a new era. Con-
tagious nationalistic fervor spread quickly.
Resentment against colonial rulers be-
came pronounced. Those Vietnamese who
journeyed to Europe to be educated or to
fight the Kaiser’s troops could "hardly
fail to be impressed by the gap between
democratic theory and colonial practice.

One such Vietnamese, a young nation-
alist who would later be known as Ho
Chi Minh,’ appeared at the Versailles
Peace Talks in 1919, begging the great
powers to grant his people their indepen-
dence. Ho’s plea fell on deaf ears. Turn-
ing to another source for help, Ho be-
came a member of the French Commun-
ist Party, which sympathized with his
cause.

Quickly acquiring a reputation, Ho

was sent to the Soviet Union and China-

where he worked as a political organizer.
In 1930, he established the Vietnamese
Communist Party, dedicated to the evic-

tion of the French colonialists. Before‘

long, Ho’s organization emerged as the
strongest anti-French group in Vietnam,
attracting support from communist and
non—communist sources.

Organization of Vietminh

Late in the 1930’s, the Japanese in-
vaded Indochina, ousted the French, and
imposed a new dictatorship on the people
of Vietnam. In response to this different
threat, Ho‘ Chi Minh organized a broader
independence movement, the ‘- Vietminh,
which soon encompassed Vietnamese
nationalists of various political affilia-
tions. “ I

v In the vanguard of the Japanese re-
sistence ,movement, Ho Chi Minh and
the’ Vietminh won the informal recogni-
tion’ of the Allies and the special appre-

ciation of the United States. In addition’
to supplying the U.S. with vital intelli-

gence - information, Vietminh soldiers
helped rescue American pilots shot down

, over Indochina.

President Roosevelt, grateful for the
assistance of the Vietminh and commit-_
ted .to the principle ‘-of self'-determina-
tion for. all peoples, vowed to press for

V _a free Vietnam after the war. Although
‘President Roosevelt didn’t live to witness’

the event, his "hope was realized on Sep-
tember 2, 1945, when Ho proclaimed
Vietnam’s independence.

Establishment of Free State

Ousting.\ the Japanese puppet, Bao.
Dai, the Vietminh, established a govern- '
xment which F_rance recognized as “a

free state” in March, 1946. In November
however,’ convinced‘ that they’ could re-

impose colonial control over Vietnam_,

the French bombed «the ‘port of Hai-

 . pong, - Killing g-6,000,; _Vietnamese gcivilians

 

d s%S,i.I!_I,1..iI1..8.3';‘19PS.3n.d..l?l99s1ywar-,

ture of Atlantic defense alliance propos-
als, refused to back Vietnam’s freedom
fighters, despite the commitments of his
predecessor. Vietnamese nationalists con-
cluded that the Allies had double crossed
them.

Boldly, the French sought American
support for their campaign against the
Vietminh, softpedaling the nationalistic
nature of the independence movement.
At first, the United States shrank scrup-
ulously from involvement and actually
urged the French to meet the Vietminh’s
demand for an end to colonial rule.

Change in Sympathies

Two events, however, changed Ameri-
ca’s attitude toward the Vietnamese con-~
flict. First, China went communist. Sec-
ond, the Korean War broke out. As a re-
sult of the two developments, the United
States stopped viewing the struggle in
Vietname as a struggle for freedom. Sud-
denly, it was part of a devious commun-
ist attempt to take over the world.

The United States decided to side
with the French" against the_ Vietminh.
By 1954, America was supplying 80 per
cent of France’s war material. In the
end, however, the overwhelming desire
of the Vietnamese people for indepen-
dence proved decisive. Assisting the guer-
illas, Vietnamese peasants -helped bring
about France’s humiliating defeat at
Dienbienphu.

The Geneva Accords of 1954 ended
the conflict, “providing for a temporary
division of Vietnam in order to "separate
the hostile sides and make a cease-fire
effective. French forces were to assemble’
south of the 17th parallel. Vietminh
troops were to gather north. Most im-
portantly, nationwide elections were to
be held in 1956.

Results of Division

France, anxious to leave Vietnam and
little concerned about the country’s fu-
ture, departed unceremoniously, allow-
ing the United States to fill the power

vacuum. Backed by American dollars, 

Ngo Dinh Diem, a . Catholic aristo-
crat who had not opposed“ the French,
emerged as the most important leader in

A the southernzone.

Ho ChiiMinh, a’ xnational hero as "a
result of his primary role in the war for
independence, basked in the warmth
of his countrymen’s esteem and confi-

dently looked forward to the elections_

he almost certainly would win. Accord-
ing to the late President Eisenhower,,Ho
was so popular at the time of the fight-
ing that he could have garneredgas much
as 80 per cent of the national vote.

- Diem, gazing into his crystal ball,

- reached the same conclusionand recog-

nized that if the elections were held, he
would lose his post. Despite the specific

language of the Geneva Accords, Diem‘

announced in July, 1955 that he would
not permit the promised elections ‘to
occur.

The thought of a communist electoral
victory in Vietnam alarmed the‘ United
States little less than it disturbed Diem.
Dreading the probable consequences
of the implementation of the treaty,
America unabashedly applauded Diem’s
decision, arguing that elections in the
northern zone of Vietnam would not be
‘free. * -

In response to charges that the'Gen-
eva Accords had been violated,‘ ‘Diem
correctly pointed out that he had not
signed the agreements. However, the
Geneva Accords specifically provided

American spokesmenyalso aptly argu-
ed that the United Stateshad not signed
the Geneva Accords. However, in‘ a uni-

lateral declaration‘ issued June 29, 1954, A

the U.S. government had solemnly pledg-
ed to support the principle of “unity
through free elections” with reference

to Vietnam and hadpromised not to con?

travene the Geneva Agreements;

.' called upon‘ Diem to alter his decision

and pleaded with the French to see that

the Geneva Accords were carried out.

Their efforts were to no avail. Embitter-«
ed, the Vietminh felt betrayed.

Weighing his alternatives, Ho decided
againstdeclaring war. on Diem. Weary
of strife, Ho’s supporters needed a re-_
spite after 15 years of exhausting con-
flict. Recognizing that his followers
could endure only so much, Ho chose to
build up the northern’half of his country
before challenging the man who had
seized control of the southern half.

Diem, in the meantime, attempted to
strengthen his position by abolishing
village elections in the south, replacing
elected leaders with his own appointees.
Labeling Vietminh and communist sym-
pathizers ipso facto enemies of the state,
he rounded up dissenters of various sorts,
imprisoning some and executing others.

Displaying little tact, Diem.’ limited
the autonomy of the Montagnards and
persecuted the powerful Cao Dai and Hoa
Hao sects. Forcing the peasants to pay
rents to absentee landlords, he alienated
the bulk of the population steadfastly
refusing to V initiate a. significant land
reform program. Resentment against the
southern leader mounted quickly.

The northern government made a
similar mistake. Confiscating private

property and redistributing the -land to

the peasants, overzealous officials exe-
cuted and imprisoned landlords with
little» finesse. Opposition to the brutal

' excesses of agrarian reform was wide-

‘spread and one village finally rose in
revolt.

Unlike Diem, however, Ho Chi Minh
opted to admit his errors. The northern
government engaged in an exercise of
self-criticism, apologizing to the people
for its mistakes. The two men responsible
for the persecutions of the landlord class
resigned from their posts and a more
popular agrarian reform program was

_ inaugurated.

Meanwhile, a number of powerful
southern groups became increasingly up-
set with the repressive tactics of the
Diem regime and began to retaliate
vigorously. In the spring of 1960, a group
of prominent sougherners issued a dec-
laration of grievances and were subse-
quently arrested. In November, military
forces. launched an abortive coup.

Although \southern communists’. and
former Vietminh, Diem’s primetargets,
were perhaps more disturbed than any-
one else by Diem’s actions, they had re-
framed, by and large, from fighting back,
because Ho Chi Minh had counseled

otherwise. Convinced that Diem’s unpop— -
\ ularity made his downfall
‘Ho argued that there was no need for

imminent,

vigorous guerilla activity.

‘Conditions in the south, however, be-
came so intolerable for some that native
_ communists decided to move, with or
without Ho’s support. On December 20,
1960 the National Liberation Front (NFL)
was established by southern Vietminh
veterans: Ho, realizing that conflict could
no longer .be postponed, formally recog-
nized the NLF early in 1961.

The southern insurgents mounted an
intense guerilla campaign and achieved
a considerable degree of success. Native
Southerners who had gone north in 1954,
«expecting to stay only two years, return-
ed home after a long absence to fight
against Diem. Later, native northerners
joined them.- . '

American Intervention

From America’s point of view, the
“infiltration” represented an act of

aggression. The Geneva Accords had la-V

beled the 17th parallel a “provisional
military demarcation line  . not in any

way (to) be interpreted as constitutinga

political or territorial boundary.” How-
ever, the United States had come ‘to
regard the line as a permanent border
and Vietnamfs southern zone as a se-

JI. parate state. ;" . 1 .

As American aid to Diem and», north

fighting in the south grew bloodieran
more intense. Religious friction ,co'm"p
cated the picture. Arresting Buddhi;

Diem incurred the wrath of an extreme‘
ly powerful group. 4 I

On November 1, 1963‘ a militar;
junta gunned down Diem ‘and seize
the reins of power in the southern par
of Vietnam. On November_ 22;, “Job
Kennedy was assassinated and Lyndo,‘
Johnson became President of the Unite]

quarters, it seemed possible that the wa

However, President Johnson continued: '-

had been to relinquish their power._':to

Although the war dragged on,“ its")
nature changed significantly as a result T

of several, developments. Late in July
1964, southern vessels,
American destroyers, bombarded. som
northern islands and attacked‘ a grou
of fishing boats in the Gulf of Tonkin
In retaliation, northern torpedo vessel
attacked two American destroyers. "

Escalation

Calling the action unprovoked, “Presi-
dent Johnson asked for the power,-to
“take all necessary measures to repel

any armed attack against the forcesofu
the United States and to prevent further;

aggression.” Without full knowledge of"

the facts and not realizing the implij-._g
cations of such a blank check, the Sen-_
ate complied with the President’s_\re-__

quest. .  .-

On February 7, 1965 NLF -.-‘forces
launched a surprise raid "on an American
barracks in Pleiku. »Deeming a reprisa
necessary,/. President Johnson ordered
U.S. planes to bomb the north. Shovirf“
into the background his campaignrefe ,
_ences to the undesirability of a “wider
war,” the President continued the bomb‘.-
ing raids after the initial retaliation, - ~

Escalation proceeded at a rapid pace.
In June, President Johnson authorized

the use of American troops in combat; :

and America’s involvement. in the war
changed dramatically. The other side’_fs
forces swelled too and China and «the

Soviet Union began to pump more and -

more equipment into Vietnam.

Appeasement

Panthers Win Back to Back Games
Ferris Gets Four TD’s;

At The

Goal Post

by Jerry Gruebel
Sports Editor

 

PittSNevvPs O R T S

This reporter wasn’t really hit with the reality of the last two
weeks of Panther football until a jubilant mob of students tore
down the goal post after Saturday’s home opener against Navy.

When the Panthers upset Duke and just about every prognos-
ticator in the country, there was still good reason to believe that
the win was nothing more than a fluke. After all, the Panthers
won by a narrow, 14-12, margin, and they scored a big fat zero in
the second half.

But the margin of victory against Navy was a particularly
The 46-19 score left little doubt that new coach
Carl DePasqua has molded the Panthers into a respectable foot-
ball team, and the students heartily approved.

Perhaps Navy coach Rick Forzano said it all after the
game when he said, “Coach DePasqua and his staff has done a
fantastic job.”

, “Before the season,” commented Forzano, “I thought Pitt
would be the most improved team in the East, and from what I
saw today, I know they are.”

PANTHER BACKERS had their day Saturday, too. After the Pan-.

thers trotted off theifield in the season home opener, the fans celebrated
the big, 46-19, score by tearing down the goal post. Coach Carl DePas-
qua and his magical Panthers hope to give the fans cause to celebrate

again next Saturday.

‘The sinking of the Midshipmen marked the first time in 46

3 games that the Panthers were able to put together back-to-back

victories. The last time the Panthers won two straight was in
1964 when the Blue and Gold dumped William & Mary, 34-7, and
West Virginia, 14-0. , '

1 “We're progressing in every game,” said DePasqua, smil-
ing, and yet unsurprised, or almost so. “I didn’t think we'd score
that much.”

The 46 points against Navy was the most points scored in a

single game by any Panther eleven since 1965, when John Michel-
son’s squad lost to WVU, 63-48.

But the scoreboard. looked a bit weird when the game ended,
and one reporter who still doubted the Panther feat, asked Forz-

‘> ano to compare Pitt with the Nittony Lions.

“Pitt,” said Forzano, who watched Penn State dump his
Navy squad, 45-22, in the season opener, “will give Penn State
a real go for their money.”

Forzano may have been a bit generous in evaluating the
Panthers, but DePasqua is not looking that far ahead, anyway.
The Alpine fedora-clad coach is attacking the season one game at
a time, and.that could spell trouble for Tulane (which is no Penn
State). ‘

It looks like DePasqua enjoys the traditional “tear down the

‘, goal post” ceremonies, an activity reserved for winning football -
_ games, as much as the students. A 5‘

Defense "°Zeroes” Rush

After the crowd had stopped
roaring, the band had stopped
playing, and the students had car-
ried off the remains of the goal
posts from the stadium, ABC
Sports commentator Howard Co-
sell proclaimed to America that
the Panthers were no longer the
patsies of college football.

Navy’s Midshipmen didn’t have
to be told. Carl DePasqua’s grid-
ders crushed Navy 46-19 Saturday
afternoon and for the first time in
46 games the Panthers had put to-
gether back to back victories. And
it was the first time since 1961 that
a Pitt team had beaten the gridders
from Annapolis.

“This was a tremendous team
effort,” explained DePasqua.“We
let down a little in the second half
with the fumbles, but there’s no
question I’m satisfied with the ef-
fort. We played 60 minutes of foot-
ball today.”

“We’re starting to put it togeth-
er,” he continued. “We’ve been
progressing every game and I hope
we’ll continue to progress.”

Displaying a well-balanced run-
ning and passing game, the Pan-
thers jumped off to a 20-0 lead in
the first quarter, scoring the first
three times they had the ball. The
offense scored at least once in each
quarter and the 46 point total on the
scoreboard is the highest in a win-
ning effort since 1952.

Tailback Denny Ferris scored
four touchdowns and was named
the outstanding player in the
game. The junior speedster pick-
ed up 81 yards in 24 carries and
scored on a 19 yard run, two one-
yard dives and on a 42 yard pass
play from quarterback Jim Friedl.

Friedl had hisubest day as a Pan-

ther completing l8 of 27 passes for V
220 yards and one touchdown. He

also ran for one touchdown. In the
first half, Friedl was a perfect 7-7
in passing. Steve Moyer grabbed
eight of the Friedl passes for 99
yards, while George Medich had
seven receptions.

The Panther defense, mean-
while, completely crushed the
Navy ground game and forced Mid-
die mistakes all afternoon. Navy
was held to zero yards rushing,
which was one yard better than
Duke could manage last week when
the Panther defense yielded minus
one yards rushing to the Blue De-
vils. " »

Heads up effort by the defense
gave the offense good field position
all afternoon. On Navy’s-second
offensive series linebacker Geoff
Brown blocked a punt and the Pan-
thers had possession at the Navy
four. On the next series for Navy,
Jack Dykes recovered a fumble
by quarterback Mike McNallen on
the Navy five. Lloyd Weston also
recovered a fumble, while Dave

THE SCOREBOARD tells the story. It’s been a long time since

Panther backers saw their team trounce a Pitt Stadium guest, but in

McNallen was continually har-

dumped nine times for minus 45
yards. He put the ball in the air
51 times for a new Navy record,
and completed 23 for 254 yards,

coming late in the third quarter.

The other two Navy’ scores re-

Panther offense. On the first play . , ,
of the second quarter, Joe Spicko . ’ '

a punt attempt and Navy recovered

In the third quarter, Navy’s Tom
Sher intercepted a Jim Friedl pass‘
and returned it 42 yards for a touch
down.

“We felt we would stop them a
little better than we did,” explained
Navy coach Nick Forzano. “Our
pass ‘protection broke down and we
didn’t have time to throw.”

Some people never give up.

Let’s go. back about three weeks. At that time, I wrote

-_ . about an equal rights problem which I found surprising and am-

- using. Yet today, almost three weeks later, dear Mr. C. still

persists in his battle to keep me out of the press luncheons,
press box — and who knows what next.

Now I hate to keep harping on a personal problem, but
we gals have our rights too . . .

Before going any further, I think it’s-now safe to identify

' my friend, since he has been so kind as to do the same for me.

I - He’s none other than ex-Pitt News sports editor Myron Cope,

. who is currently the sports director of WTAE radio

5 and a contributing writer for Sports Illustrated magazine. So
' much for personalities. -

After my first radio encounter, I expected the whole issue
to die; surely Myron would feel relieved by getting his big
, 1‘ hang-up off his ches. The issue did die for aboutcone week
 ..—while Myron was out of town. But sure enough, last Wed-

of Myron and Company on the air.

g “Carl DePasqua held another sports luncheon but that
girl reporter (it seems he hadn’t gotten up the courage to
, ‘identify me yet) turns it into a weather report,” bables Mr.
 Cope. ' .
So what’s all this about the weather? At the Oklahoma
, game, a lot of Panther Players suffered from heat exhaustion
 due to the 95 degree temperatures on the playing field. Fans
.5 even collapsed due to the heat. With the team traveling south
 once again to North Carolina for the Duke game, wasn’t it
-6 logical to inquire about the wheather conditions?

 I’m' not sure just what Cope hoped to gain by the repeat
‘ -performance on the radio but if his intentions were to scare
me away from the future luncheons, he failed. And thus, we
set the stage for the most recent adventure into the mass
media. - -

-, Last Tuesday evening, Mr. Cope put me on television’.
_ Thank-you Myron. Thank-you for the publicity you didn’t want
I, to give me. Mr. Cope claimed that all his radio fans were
 cu_rious to see me. His fans got their wish and Myron got still
another chance to flingarrows.

. “Why do you insist on intruding at these luncheons,” he
pleaded; “And what does your father think about your un-
ladylike behavior? Herlfather should take her home and give
her a good spanking,” he concluded.

 Well Mr. Cope, what does your mother ‘think about your
ungentlemanly like behavior? Is chivalry dead? If I were
you, Myron, I’d worry about my father (ex-football player)

Quinter will have able if not
ample replacements. The starting
team, yet to be named, will be
spelled often by the remainder
of the squad.

Thus far, the Cubs have avoid-
ed any serious mishaps. The
usual assortment of pulled and
aching muscles should not keep
anyone out of Friday’s fracas.
Following that contest, the only
game remaining for the Cubs is
at Penn State October 24.

Streaking past some of the
best cross country teams in
the nation, the Pitt harriers
gallopped to a third place finish
in the Notre Dame Invitation, Sat-
urday in South Bend, Ind.

According to Coach Jim Banner,
although yesterday’s official re-
sults found the Panther squad in
third. an unofficial tally by Coach
Banner has them finishing one
higher. in second place. The dis-
crepany arose as a result of the
seventh place finish of Mark Vorn—
hagen. Banner claims he finished
higher and is confident that the
final scoring will have the har-
riers in the number two spot.

With 25 teams competing, the
field was crowded. Among the
schools participating were the
likes of Michigan State, Purdue,
Penn State. and Notre Dame.
Leading the field for the Pitts-
burgh contingent was Jerry Rich-
ey again, who finished fourth. Fol-
lowing him was Greg Rogers,
Dave Chesborogh and then the
controversial finish of Mark Vorn—
hagen. Dave Szabat and Bill Har-
vey also ran.

“Bill is coming around,” Coach
Banner commented. About Richey,
who is almost back to his pre-sur-
gery condition Banner remarked
that “Jerry’s coming along fine.”

The Notre Dame Invitational
was the fourth meet the harriers
have entered this season. Their
first two were triangular meets,
one with Ohio U. and Kent State,
followed by the Bowling Green-
Buffalo meet.

In the Bowling Green-Buffalo
triangular meet, run here on Sept.
22, Pitt completely overpowered
their opponents, winning handily
23-34-104. Bowling Green came in
second and Buffalo third. Jerry
Richey, who for the second week
in a row was only expected to run
a mile, went all the way. Richey
finished second.

day, Oct. 2, again on Flagstaff

Hill, the Pitt harriers masacred a
relatively week Cleveland State
squad, 15-61. Indicating what a
lopsided affair it really was is the
fact that both Richey and top
freshman Dave Szabat didn’t even
run. Yhe Pitt squad still streaked
to the first seven places, com-
pletely dominating the field.

The team now boasts a 3-0 rec-
ord with two more individual
meets left. The harriers meet

West Virginia, at home on Satur-
day at 11 a.m., and then on Nov. 8
they travel to Penn State to meet
the Nitanny Lions.

"They’re all doing a great job,”
commented Coach Banner. He is
extremely pleased with the team’s
progress and is frank enough to
admist that “they’re doing much
better than I expected.”

An independent team,,known as The Table, clinched the
campus intramural softball championship by handing the Del-

ta Tau Delta batmen an 8-2 defeat.

The Table, confident of vic-
tory from the outset, spent the
pregame warmup discussing
their victory celebration.

Their confidence was justi-
fied. In the first inning Steve
Volk and John Stanich scored
on Ron Meigs’ triple. Bob Ma-

‘: dar’s double scored Meigs. Bill
' _Pavlisak and Les Zupon also ac-

counted for two runs to put a to-

tal of six on the scoreboard.

Denny McGlone came home
to give the Delts one run in the
second inning.

The Table increased their
lead by two runs in the .fourth

inning. Gus Henicles scored
the .last run for the Delts in
the sixth inning, making the
final score 8-2 with The Table
as victors.

Both teams performedwell in
their dividion play-offs. Delta
