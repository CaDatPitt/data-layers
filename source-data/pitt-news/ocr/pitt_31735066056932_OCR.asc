Blacks need the capability to
establish and operate their own
community, according to rap
activist Chuck D.

Thursday, in a two—hour lec-
ture at David Lawrence Hall
sponsored by the Black Action
Society, the leader of the rap
group Public Enemy covered
issues ranging from hip—hop
and its inﬂuence on the libera-
tion struggle to media distor-
tion to the situation of the
black community in the United
States.

He discussed the two differ-
ent states of reality facing black
and white students in America.

“Blacks don’t need to worry
about whether they are at a
black school or white school.
Any way you can get an educa-
tion, get it,” Chuck D said. “It’s
backward thinking to go to
school just to get a job, you
have to take your skills back to
the community.”

Chuck D addressed many
other topics including Black
Histoiy Month, which he said
should be every month for the
black community.

“You don’t wait for someone
to give you a holiday, you take
it,” he explained.

O'Connor to meet Mt.

Graham activists today

Byjohn Temple and Beth Kovaly
The Pi1tNews

Bolstered by the prospect of todayfs long-awaited meeting with
Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor, opposers of the telescope con-
struction project on Mount Graham plan to redouble the intensity
of their protats.

Members of Friends of Mt. Graham, which opposes the Pitt-
aided project, said they have been completely ignored by universi-
ty astronomers and administrators, despite their claim that the pro-
ject was ill-conceived

“Basically«we’re going to present him with the information,
show him we have overwhelming campus support and say that
the University of Arizona [which began the project] has been deal-
ing with riots and protests since they began the project 12 years
ago,” spokesperson Josh Knauer said. ‘

Other than Arizona, Pitt is the only U.S. institution to continue
supporting the project According to Knauer, anti-telescope rioters
caused about $200,000 in damage to the Arizona campus.

“If the chancellor is foolish enough to continue with this, the
same type of things will be happening here,” Knauer said “We
believe and will always believe in nonviolent protests, but we will
let our presence be known a lot more than we have in the past”

Representatives from Friends of Mt. Graham meet O’Connor
today at 1 p.m. A rally will be held on the William Pitt Union patio
at noon and a press conference after the meeting with the chancel-
lor.

at BiGALA meeting

ByThanitaAdams
ForIbePtttNews

Substituting handshakes for sex-
ual contact, approximately 15
people hypothetically contracted
the HIV virus last Wednesday.

Participants at the Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance meeting
found that shaking hands with
one person was like shaking
hands with ﬁve or 10 people in a
viral sense. Only one person
remained uninfected, because he
had not shaken hands with any-
one else in the room.

The mock demonstration
showed how easily the AIDS virus
can be spread. Afterward, the co-
chair of the Education Committee
for BiGALA defined Acquired
Immune Deﬁciency Syndrome.

“AIDS causes a breakdown of
the body’s defense system by
affecting the body’s t-cells, the
white blood cells that ﬁght off dis-
ease,” said the speaker, who
asked not to be identiﬁed. “AIDS

is not a single disease, but a con-
stellation of symptoms caused by
infection, a group of disorders.”

A person carrying HIV may
appear healthy for many years but
can infect others even if there are
no outward symptoms.

The speaker, who is a Pitt facul-
ty member, reviewed ways that
AIDS can and cannot be transrnit-
ted, which she learned by training
for the Northeast Ohio Task Force
on AIDS.

“HIV is found in semen, blood
and vaginal secretions in the high-
est concentrations,” she explained.
“It is found in low concentrations
in saliva, tears, urine and, in rare
cases, breast milk. HIV is transrnit-
ted through oral, anal and vaginal
sex, needle sharing, blood transfu-
sions and sometimes from mother
to fetus. The virus (HIV) cannot
pass through undamaged skin or
latex but can enter through mucus
membranes.”

The speaker pointed out that

UP Gallery Art exhibit begins today

By Steve Abate
For The Pitt News

An art exhibition created by husband and
wife team Thomas J. Hagen and Anna Annus
Hagen is showing at Pitt's UP Gallery from now
until March 6 and from March 16 through April
16.

The work of Anna Hagen is a surreal type of
art combining the techniques of metalworking
and sculpture. She created this style and has
dubbed it “Multiples."

“Some may consider my work to be sick," she
said. “I have a light side and a dark side."

Thomas Hagen is a very detailed painter. In
contrast to his wife’s work, he said he concen-
trates on constructing the most accurate paint-
ings possible. He works and does his art part-
time.

“I consider painting like model making. I cre-
ate my works in parts and continue building
upon them,” he said.

Anna Hagen was born in Latvia and Thomas
Hagen spent his childhood in Montana. The
couple now resides in New York City.

The UP Gallery is located on the corner of
Forbes Avenue and Bouquet Street across from
Miami Subs.

media, and Chuck explained
his viewpoint as to where mass
media stands.

“The media shows basically a
white-American viewpoint that
does nothing but shape peo-
ple’s minds, straight-forward
cardboard living." he said.
“Anything that is threatening to
the masses is controversial."

According to Chuck 1), the
visual means of the media is a
power that cannot be underes-
timated. as it is responsible for
the perceptions that children
form about their role models.
This situation, he said, has
transformed a great deal in the
last two decades.

“Black people had no view-
point as far as the media went
in the ‘70s,’’ he said. “When I
was growing up, there was
nothing to pattern yourself
after."

Chuck directly confronted the

issue of whether a true black
community exists in 1993, then
explained the necessary steps
to create one.

“The black community ain’t
nothing but a plantation," he
said. “For it to be a true black
community, blacks must have
control over their economic sit-
uation, their educational situa-
tion and have the ability to
make their own laws. The
existing law protects black
crime and black chaos and
keeps it in the black cornmuni-
ty so that it can destroy itself."

The need for enforcement of
laws in communities and con-
trol ove.r the educational struc-
ture and black curriculum in
high schools composed two
vital aspects of Chuck’s discus-
sion. If those elements fall into
place, “then you’ll have your
own police structure," he said.

As far as Chuck D is con-
cerned blacks must run their

own communities. “We need to
service ourselves as much as
possible,” he explained.

Chuck D elaborately outlined
key steps in this plan:

First, the rebuilding of the
black man. “The black man
must step up and take respon-
sibility and stop leaving it up to
the black woman.”

Secondly, rebuilding the
black family structure. “Adults
must act like adults and raise
their children, children need a
mother and a father figure.”

Third, “We must have proper
information learning centers,
and we must have our own
black schools with our own
curriculum. A school is not
black because it’s filled with
black people.”

And finally, “We must also
have a proper networking sys-
tem between the black busi-
nesses, and make deals for our-
selves,” Chuck explained.

attended the meeting and held discussions with the direc-
tor of Affrmiative Action, the assistant dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences and other administration.

After brainstorming in small group discussions for possi-
ble causes and potential solutions for Pitt’s high minority
drop-out rate, the students reported their findings, includ-
ing:

-Financial problems — many students may not be aware
of the availability of financial aid and the procedure for
acquiring it. Workshops on filling out financial aid forms
and the advertising of their due dates were suggested.

°Lack of focus for first-year students. Many first-year
minority students are first-generation college students and
are not familiar with advising and other assistance pro-
grams. Study groups and mentor programs were recom-
mended.

-The Pitt environment — attending a large urban school
is a potential culture shock for many students. The need
for more African—American counselors and advisors for
academic and social problems was expressed. A consolida-
tion of African-American campus organizations was sug-
gested.

While James said he will make suggestions for change to
the administration, he said that no one is accountable
except African-American students.

“The whole purpose of this seminar is to determine what
we can do for ourselves — a movement by our people on
how to act and think,” James said.

Continued from page 2
HIV infection through a blood transfusion is now
extremely unlikely, and the most common means of
infection by far is unprotected sex.

She dispelled the myths that AIDS can be contract-
ed by sharing things such as toilets and utensils.

“HIV is not transmitted by inanimate objects,” she
said. “HIV is very fragile and can be killed by heat,
alcohol and even soap and water.”

There is currently no cure for AIDS, and preven-
tion was stressed. Altemrtives safer than intercourse
were suggested, such as masturbation, massage, kiss-
ing and sex toys (which should always be washed
and not shared). As long as no bodily fluids come in
contact with broken skin, HIV cannot be contracted.

When using condoms, only water-based lubn'cants
should be used to prevent breakage. Oil—based prod-
ucts such as petroleum jelly will destroy a condom
and render them ineffective. Lubricants with a sper-
micide such as Nonoxynol-9 were suggested and
have been shown to kill HIV in laborxtory tes's.

Although some said they felt that practicang safe
sex was a bother and “ruined the spontaneity,”
everyone agreed that safe sex was well worth it
when faced with me harsh reality of death.

The speaker brought the meeting to a close with
one last point.

“Safe sex can be hot sex. Make it fun, don’t make
it a chore. Practice it, do it; if you make safe sex a
habit, it’s no big deal.”

Accepting the degree, Star’/.l said, “This yearly ceremo-

stands in relation to society’s other great institutions. It
also is a reminder that any one of us who walks the. uni-

A group of 120 high school seniors and their families
were honored at the ceremony.

“I would now like to recognize other important

dents, chosen by their principal or guidance counselor

O’Connor asked their families to rise also, saying,
“Your effort, your words of encouragement and your

Empty aid

Candidate Clinton criticized the Bush Administration for not doing
more to help Brxnia and promised to enforce a no-ﬂy zone, tighten
sanctions against the Serbs and possibly arm Bosnia’s Muslims. But while
President Clinton rejected all those ideas, he still contended that some-
thing must be done.

By the time you read this, American planes may have already
dropped vital medical and food supplies into the war-tom countryside of
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sounds like the Clinton Administration is finally
doing something noble and humanitarian for that country’s starving and
suffering on both sides of the war, right? Wrong. ,

Even before the first plane takes oif, the Pentagon has described the
action as merely symbolic, and an  of the exercise shows that it
will almost certainly fail in substance. Unarmed and unescorted U.S. C-
130 cargo planes will ﬂy at 10,000 feet or higher while trying to thread a
needle of narrow, mountain valley regions and gently drop the supplies
into the towns. Hardly an easy task from such a high altitude. Most of
the aid will certainly land out of the reach of the people it is supposed to
help. With the exception of Tuzia, the targeted towns are reportedly sur-
rounded by hostile Serbian factions and extreme right-wing paramilitary

J groups. If Muslims leave the relative safety of the town to get the sup-

plies in the countryside, they will certainly be killed.

The only people who will be able to safely collect the humanitarian
aid are the ones who have been causing the strife all along — the ones
with the guns.

Although he is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin
Powell assured Clinton that there is limited risk to American pilots.
Refusing to give the cargo planes armed escorts opens them up to
attack. A constant of the war has been that when one side gets a chance
to attack without retaliation, they do it.

The suffering and starving people in Bosnia—Herzegovina do not need
a symbolic gesture, they need help. This superﬁcial attempt to show the
United Nations that we are serious about solving the problem in the for-
mer Yugoslavia will only serve to show the world that we don’t have the
resolve to make the proper moral decision. We must give real aid to the
suffering in Bosnia—Herzegovina, not false hope.

A Welcomed presence

Thursday night, the University of Pittsburgh was graced with the
appearance of rap activist Chuck D of the group Public Enemy. Chuck
D spoke for two hours at David Iawrence, addressing a variety of issues.

Whatever money was spent, if any, by the Black Action Society to
bring him here was much more worthwhile than the thousands of dol-
lars spent by PPC to bring ex-Los Angeles Police Chief Darryl Gates to
this campus.

The continuing theme in his speech was one of independence, some-
thing he not only says but lives.

Public Enemy was one of the pioneers of hard-core rap and, in its
early years, was almost completely isolated by the mainstream media.
Chuck D persevered and even thrived although his message and his art
has been distorted and misunderstood up to the present day.

Although the group now receives more mainstream acceptance,
Chuck D's message has remained constant: black liberation and black
community.

And he doesn’t only say what isn’t being done but cogently says what
he thinks should be done, along the lines of the creation of a true black
community with economic and educational power.

In almost every way, Chuck D is a better role model for students than
Michael Jordan or Emmitt Smith because no one can say that he relies
mostly on his “natural” talent.

“A school is not black because it’s filled with black people,” Chuck D
said. And just because someone is on the speaking circuit doesn’t mean
that he/she has anything worthwhile to say. But Chuck D is no Darryl
Gates, and Pitt has been enriched by his presence on campus.

The doctrine which sepa-
rates church from state in the
United States has proven itself
to be one of the strongest
weapons in the oppression of
the nation’s blacks. This is due

‘ to the fact that regardless of

the variety of religions
adhered to by Americans,
America as a unit remains a
society of paganisms, seeing
that a pagan is one who “has
little or no religion  and is
marked by a frank delight in
and uninhibited seeking after
sensual pleasures and material
goods.”

Therefore, through the
pagan practices of American
presidents and government,
African ex-slaves are dealt
blows by politicians who have
been given the hand to rule
without any implication of
moral or spiritual values or
principles. For the African in
the United States, this means
her history as an ex-slave has
no moral significance, and for
the non-African, the status of
being an ex-slave is accepted
as just.

But why should this be so
for the African as the original
woman, as the creator of civi-
lization and as the source of
all spiritual inspiration? Would
it not make sense for
Americans and all human
beings to critically study a
blend of what they distinguish
as history and religion, and
then apply it to how they gov-
em themselves?

All people, whether they be
Jewish, Christian, Buddhist,
Hindu or Moslem trace their
spiritual origins to particular
individuals who hold their
spiritual ideals. The Jews point
to Abraham as .a father,
Christians worship Jesus,
Buddhists derive purity from

The pain of separating church and state

Buddha, Moslems praise
Mohammed and Hindus vener-
ate Shiva, Vishnu and Krishna.
All these individuals, who are
perceived as sacred, owe their
existence to the ‘African
woman, the mother of
humans, whose descendents
now suffer the hatred of those
who worship them.

Deriving truth through such
a study would benefit not only

Oscar
Eybers

Africans but those who remain
mystified as to the origins of
humans and the human, spiri-
tual evolution.

The separation of church
and state also confuses the
youth as to the relevance of
spirituality in the political
realm and the determinant fac-
tor of the past on the present.
Seeing that the majority of
America adheres to the Judeo-
Christian tradition, the youth
revere the plight and survival
of Abraham, Moses and their
families but are incapable of
connecting the moral lessons
provided by the lives of these
Africans to the lives of Africans
in America today. It is "almost
as if the struggles of.the
Harriet Tubman, Angela Davis,
the Nat Turner and Dr. Martin
L. King, as presented by text
books, are mere facts to be
remembered and then forgot-
ten. Unlike the glorification of
European history in school
texts and of figures in the
Torah or Bible, Africans in
America are downplayed and
rejected as worthless.

Contrary to the predicament
Africans in America face within
the institutionalized separation
of church and state, the

descendants of Tubman and
Turner continue to struggle for
spiritual and_social liberation.
Here on the University of
Pittsburgh campus, the Black
Action Society, on behalf of
the entire black population in
Pittsburgh, has recently.sub—
mitted a proposal to
Chancellor O’Connor for the
building of an African-
American cultural center.

Vanessa Liles, who is a
member of BAS’ steering com-
mittee and is the chairperson
of its Public Relations
Committee, sees an African-
American cultural center on
Pitt’s campus as “a place of
spiritual sanctity in which
Africans in Pittsburgh, both on
and off campus, may achieve
unity and rebuild their knowl-
edge of their African heritage
and culture.”

As well, Ms. Liles believes
the cultural center “will pro-
vide non-Africans with a
greater opportunity to learn,
appreciate and understand
African culture, which will, in
turn, reduce racialtension on
campus.” H

We see that regardless of the
moral and spiritual drawbacks
of the separation of church
and state in America, the
moral and spiritual struggle of
Africans in America and on
Pitt’s campus has yet to cease.
As demonstrated by Ms. Liles,
this spiritual struggle is inclu-
sive not only of the concerns
of Africans but for the
improvement of multicultural
understanding for all of
American ethnic groups; This
contradicts the singular
Eurocentric perspective of the

majority of Pitt’s professors A

and the history that Pitt’s chan-
cellors have administered the
university. '

The end of an era.

Pitt men’s swimming and diving
team's record string of 10 consecu-
tive Big East titles ended yesterday
at Trees Pool as Villanova knocked
the Panthers from their throne.

The \X'/ildcats took their first lead
of the meet during Saturdays ﬁnals
and never looked back on their
way to 700.50 points and their first
men’s conference title since 1981.
Pitfs final day rally came up short
as the Panthers ﬁnished second
with 686 points.

Pitt head coach Chuck Knoles

from its first loss in 11 years.

 Villanova dominates Big

East Women's swimming

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

To call the Big East women’s
swimming and diving champi-
onships at Trees Hall Pool this
past weekend a competition
may be stretching it a bit.

When a team rolls to :i doin-
inating 197-point victory over
its nearest competitor in a field
of 10 teams, it’s hard to muster
up any argument to the con-
trary.

That’s the only way to
describe the devastating efforts
of the Villanova Lady \Y-’ildcats,
the latest repeat champion in
collegiate sports. Employing a
firestorm of record-breaking
swimmers, ‘Nova pounded out
785.50 points, nearly 200 bet-
ter than their nearest competi-
tion, Miami of Florida which
had 588.5().

The Pitt women — winners
of nine straight before relin-
quishing the crown for the first
time ever last season — placed
a solid third with 565 points.

For Panther head coach
David Belowich, the four-day
exploits of the Lady Wildcats
left a distinct impression —
one he will not soon forget.

“This is one of the best
teams I’ve ever seen. Period,”
Belowich said. “To have five
pool records from one team in
one weekend — I’m real
impressed.

“Some of those records have
hung on since 1979. That’s just
something else.”

Led by Outstanding
Swimmer ofthe Meet Mary
Dowling, Villanova overcame
a weakness in diving to rout
the rest of the Big East
Conference. Dowling won the
200, 50() and 1,65(l free, while
anchoring several ‘Nova relay
victories. Her accomplish-
ments, coupled with the
efforts of Lisa Flood (two firsts
— 100 and 200 breaststroke)
and Meghan McCaffrey (two
firsts - 50 and 100 free), were
a trifecta of talent too much
for Pitt — or anyone in the
meet.

“To me, Lisa Flood is one of
the most talented athletes I
have ever seen,” Belowich
said. “She has set a standard in
the breaststroke that will be
difficult to top.”

Belowich was equally
impressed with the unsung
McCaffrey, a sophomore with
an untold future certainly full
of more conference titles.

“Honestly, I had McCaffrey
for my first choice,” Belowich
said, referring to the
Outstanding Swimmer ballot-
ing, “Because she held down
the relays. She qualified indi-
vidually for NCAAs in the 50
freestyle, she won two events
and really was so instrumental

Men's hoops shows signs of life-, lbeats iHoyas

By Matt Silverman
Staff Writer

In honor of Senior
Appreciation Day prior to
the Pitt Panthers game
against the Georgetown
Hoyas yesterday, the popu-
lar song, “It’s So Hard to
Say‘Goodbye, to Yesterday”
was piped throughout the
Civic Arena.

The Boyz II Men hit may
have been an apt theme to
yesterday’s performance.

For Pitt (16—8 overall, 8-8
in the conference), it was
goodbye to the seniors and
the usual man-to-man defen-
sive scheme. For the Hoyas
(13-11, 6-10) it was goodbye
to their heralded nickname
of “Hoya Paranoia” and
goodbye to 14 years of con-
secutive NCAA tournament
appearances.

It was a game typified by
slow zone-against—zone
defense and horrid shooting
by both teams, as Pitt’s Jerry
McCullough sunk two key
free throws in the final hur-
ried minute of play to give
the Panthers a 51-48 victory
and keep their own NCAA
chances alive. ’

Women's hoops crushes the Orange, 57-48

Byjason Brame
Staff Writer

,The Pitt women’s basketball team con-
cluded its 1992-'93 home schedule with a
57-48 win over Syracuse University, send-
ing the squad into its ﬁnal Big East game at
Miami riding a two-game winning streak.

The Panthers used 18 points from game-
high scorer Jonna Huemrich to cruise
against an Orangewoman team that had
previously beaten them 61-59 at Manley
Field House in Syracuse.

“I thought we got good shots,” Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce said. “It’s the same phi-
losophy we had in the UConn game -
we’re spreading things out a little more
which allows us to make easier passes and
screen a little better.”

The Panthers consistently ran 15 to 20
seconds off of the 30—second shot clock,
holding on to a lead that grew to as many
as 19 points.

“I think it’s best to try to use 30 sec-
onds," Bruce said. “I’ve never been one to
say, ‘Bring it up and take the first available
shot we find.’ Everyone can get a shot
here, and it’s a matter of just getting the
right ones.”

Unlike the Jan. 13 game, Pitt found a
way to handle Syracuse center Holly

Oslander, who scored only six points — 16
fewer than previously.

“Last game she crushed us; we didn’t
play her well ‘at all,” Pitt center Turia
Ransom said. “Our game plan [today] was
keep it out of the post position with a

three-quarter front la defensive technique]

and keep it away from her.”

“We changed our offense from last
game, I know that,” Oslander said. “Our
offense now is that I’m out away from the
basket and am not posting up at all. I don’t
know why. It’s all very frustrating.”

“Sometimes the players don’t understand
what the coaching staff is telling them,”
Jacobs said of Oslander’s offensive misgiv-
ings. “What we were trying to do is to go
to our four player [power forward]. If they
were going to key on Holly then we were
going to key on [power forward Kristen
McCoryl and it finally got going late in the
game.”

Much like Wednesday’s win against the
University of Connecticut, Bruce instituted
pressure on the ball throughout the game.
The three-quarters press forced the Orange
into 20 turnovers and enabled Pitt to
snatch 12 steals.

“That’s what our guards are supposed to
do — defend and get in their face,”

Panther guard Jill McElhinny said. “Coach '

Bruce always says ‘Pressure the passer’ so
it’s easier for our big girls to defend and
get around.

“We knew we could [force a lot of
turnoversl,” Ransom said. “I guess they
didn’t take care of the ball and we benefit-
ed from it.”

“[The press] caused some problems
early,” Syracuse head coach Barbara Jacobs
said. “We didn’t practice for it, but right
before the game we got an inkling that
they were going to do that. We just didn’t
adjust well right away. Once we adjusted
they had to take it off.”

Syracuse was led by senior guard Erin
Kenneally who matched Huemrich with 18
points. Because of Oslander’s lack of
involvement, Kenneally was forced to run
almost every aspect of the Orangewomen’s
offense.

“She got [inside on cuts] because we
helped out a lot and we opened it up for
her,” Pitt center Turia Ransom said. “Once
she gets going it’s hard to stop her because
she’s good on the drive. Whenever we
picked her up early she wouldn’t hurt us,
but when we let her get into the flow of
things she would.”

“She plays [that well] all the time,” Jacobs
said. “She’s a very steady player. All year

gymnastics
rebounds
at Ball St.

By Ken Gaither
and Todd 8. Rimer
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s gym-
nastics team was on
shaky ground heading
into Ball State this week-
end. Not only was it com-
ing off a season—low team
performance of 178.90
points last week at
George Washington
University, but two of its
top performers were side-
lined with the flu.

Without the services of
senior Kristin Brown and
sophomore Michaelene
“Mikie” Myers, Pitt
women’s gymnastics
Coach Debbie Yohman
said she knew it would
take a solid team effort to
compensate and also to
erase the low morale on
the team coming off a
string of disappointing
losses.

“Before the meet, I told
them I expected nothing
less than 100 percent
from all of them,” she
said. “And they delivered.
I’m very happy with their
performances.”

A strong and experi-
enced Central Michigan
team took first with 188.7
points in the tri-meet,
while host Ball State fin-
ished second with 185.25
and Pitt third with 182.0
points. Despite the loss,
Pitt’s performance was
highlighted by a complete
team effort and some stel-
lar individual perfor-
mances.

The Panthers began in
a spectacular fashion,
scoring a season high of
46.05 points on the vault.
Meg Johns (9.2), Alisha
Friend (9.4) and Bethany
Toellner (9.4) all scored
career highs, while senior
Karen Jlorgenson con-
tributed with a typically
Solid 9.0. First-year stu-
dent Christine Battista
filled in admirably for
Myers, chipping in with a
score of 9.15.

“Some of the judges
said our vaults were the

. best they’ve ever seen,”

Yohman said.

On the bars, Pitt tallied
a score of 44.10 points,
led by first-year gymnast
Shannon Brown’s 9.2
points and Karen
]orgenson’s 9.05. Other
scores were provided by
Alisha Friend (8.85) and
Deena Daller' (8.65).
Battista, who had never
participated ‘on the bars
before, rounded out Pitt
scoring with an 8.35.

in the success of the relays.

“Of the pool records that
were set, three of the
records were her records.”

As for the performance of
the young Panthers,
Belowich emitted a tone
reminiscent of a proud
papa — supportive in
defeat, strong in his convic-
tion that they performed as
hard as they could.

“I am so happy and
proud of this group,”
Belowich said. “They never
stopped trying — even
when things got out of
reach. You can’t say
enough about them.”

He was particularly
pleased with the profound
curtain call of departing
senior Clare McShane.

The co-captain from
Morristown, N.J., made
finals in all three of her
individual events, placing
fourth in the 500 free, ﬁfth
in the 200 free and fifth in
the 100 free. '

“Clare has meant a lot for
our program,” Belowich
said. “Particularly in things
you don’t see in a meet.
Keeping the younger swim-
mers loose, keeping them
in focus. I’m very happy for
her.”

Christy Knobloch also
proved a brilliant battler,
swimming to three

event finals despite the
constant pain of a herniated
disc.

The sophomore from
Tampa, Fla., took third in
the 100 butterﬂy, seventh in
the 200 butterﬂy and sixth
in the 200 backstroke.

In diving, Miami's Julia
Cruz dominated both
boards and was appropri-
ately named the meet’s
Outstanding Diver.

First-year Pitt diver
Sunday Lewandowski and
the Panthers’ diving corps
also stepped up strong, out-
pointing the vaulted
Hurricane diving program
on the strength of
Lewandowski’s two second-
place finishes and high
places from Kara Sixbury,
Diane Maiese and Amy
Spinnenweber.

SPLISHCES AND SPLASH-
ES: Other top women’s Fm-
ishes include: Jill Fletcher
(third — 200 breaststroke;
third — 100 breaststroke);
women’s 400 free relay
(third); women’s 200 free
(third); women’s 400 med-
ley relay (fourth); women’s
200 medley relay (second);
Laura Zdyb (fourth — 400
IM); women’s 800 free relay
(fourth).

Villanova assistant coach Liz
Kennedy said itwas a great victory.

“This was way above what we
had expected,” Kennedy said.
“Everyone had outstanding swims,

“Itallcamedowntowhogotthe
breaks. We got the breaks.”

Pitt sophomore Matt Brady, who
took ﬁrst in the 400-yard 
medley, said that Pitt may have
been overconﬁdent going into the
meet

“We were pretty nonchalant
about the meet,” Brady said. “We
probably ﬁgured that we had the
meet in the bag because we have
10 banners hanging up on the
wall}!

Senior co—captain Kevin
Mclaughlin, who ﬁnished seventh
in the 200 breaststroke, said that
Vﬂlanova’s laid was just too much
to overcome.

“It was just too little, too late,”
Mclaughlin said. “It is pretty disap-
pointing, but the freshmen really

pidced it up for us. It was an excit-
ing meet”

Sophomore Gary Mule said it
wasjustacaseofoneteamwanti—
ng to win more.

“They worked harder than us
and were gearing up for us,” Mule
said “We gve it our best shot, but
they were a better team”

Mule also said the loss was not
necessarily all bad for the Panthers.

“We’re not down, it’s a reality
check for us,” Mule said. “We
learned a lot from this meet with
the great competition, and we’re
getting right back up.”

Jay Craft of Syracuse was named
Most Outstanding Swimmer for the
second consecutive year. Craft took
first-place finishes in both the 500
and 1,650 freestyle, along with the
200 butterfly. With his victories,
CraftsetanewBigEastrecordwith
nine individual titles in his four
years.

Darn Panaro of Miami, last year’s
NCAA diving champion, won the
one-meter competition and was
awarded the meet’s Most
Outstanding Diver for the second
straight year. Panaro also took third
place on the three-meter board.

Sebastien Goulet from Syracuse
had an excellent meet, taking first-
place ﬁnishes in the 200 
medley, the 100 butterﬂy and the
100 freestyle.

For Pitt, junior Zac Economos
won the 50 freestyle and sopho-
more David \Vlliams took the 200
freestyle. Pitt men’s 200 freestyle
relay team also took first in its
event Knoles said that as a coach
he also learned from the loss.

“The results would have been
different if we would have been
more focused on Saturday,” Knoles
said. “But I’m very proud of my
athletes. They have improved a lot
this year and this will make them
stronger.”

SPLISHFS AND SPIASHES: In

the diving events, Pitt junior co-
captain Sean Braud ﬁnished sixth in
the one-meter and fifth in the three-
meter.. Steve Wolfe placed eighth
in the one-meter and 10th in the
three—meter. First-year diver Jeremy
McClean placed fifth in the one-
meter competition. First-year swim-
mer Sami Vattiainen ﬁnished sec-
ond in the 100 and 200 freestyle.
First-year swimmer Aaron Fortner

son due to injuries, was forced
to compete with only five
instead of the usual six gym-
nasts on the beam. Those who
did participate, however, per-
formed solidly. Top scores were
recorded by Friend, who tied a
season high with 9.4 points,
Jorgenson with a season high of
the same score, Toellner with a
career best 9.35, Daller with 9.1

and Johns with an 8.6.

Pitt completed the meet with
a score of 46.0 in the floor exer-
cise, which has been one of its
strongest events this season.
The Panthers were paced by
Friend (9.4), Jorgenson (9.45),
Toellner (9.35), Johns (8.85)
and Heather Halovanic (8.75).
Yohman increased the difficulty
of the routines of Johns and
Halovanic in practice this week,
which contributed to their sub-
par scores in the event.

Though Pitt lost, the meet
was pivotal in restoring the
team’s confidence level, still
shaky after last week’s disas-
trous showing.

“There was a huge difference
in attitude and performance this
meet,” Alisha Friend said after
scoring a team high 37.25
points this weekend. “Things
were getting worse, but now
they’re getting better. It was just
25,000 times better than usual
for us.”

The Panthers have a chance

Hoyas
Continuedfrompage7
shoot a frigid 33 percent
yesterday, a season-tying
high of eight three—pointers
from beyond the tightly
packed Panther zone kept

Georgetown in the game.

Pitt, which only shot a
cool 40.5 percent from the
field, relied mostly on half-
court execution against
Georgetown’s zone, most
notably anchored down with
6-foot-10-inch first-year cen-
ter and Big East Newcomer
of the Year candidate
Othella Harrington.

Harrington, who averages
16 points and nearly nine
rebounds a game, was held
to eight points and six
boards.

“We made them shoot the
outside shot and kept the
ball out of Othella’s hands,”
Antigua said.

“Ice” McCullough, who
indeed iced the game for
the Panthers with his free
throws and tough defense
down the stretch, also
acknowledged Pitt’s oppor-
tunity to fill the lane.

“We knew from scouting
that they were a poor shoot-
ing team, so we decided to
pack it in on the inside [of

the zone],’’ McCullough said.

McCullough was also
quick to compliment senior
Chris McNeal, who scored
11 points in the contest,
including his 1,000th as a
Panther.

“I think the key to today’s
win was Chris McNeal,”
McCullough said. “He con-
trolled the boards and got
over double-digit rebounds
for the first time since
Illinois.”

“Big Daddy’s” 12 rebounds
was certainly one of the
keys to Pitt’s victory in this
slow-tempo half-court game,
but there were others.

“The key was that we did
not let down. They made a
couple of runs at us and got
the lead, but we just out-
hustled them,” Antigua said.

With 36.8 seconds remain-
ing in the game,
Georgetown did have the
lead at 48-46.

Junior point guard Joey
Brown, who started the
game for the Hoyas but
spent most of the game on
the bench in foul trouble,
hustled to check into the
game.

When Brown received the
inbounds pass he was

swarmed by McCullough
and Generalovich, who
trapped the sure-handed
ballhandler in the backcourt
and forced a traveling viola-
tion.

The play, designed by
assistant coach Joe Desantis,
was a sort of revenge for
Generalovich after he had
turned the ball over 30 sec-
onds earlier. The senior,
who was averaging 4.3 min-
utes of play coming in, saw
14 minutes as he fit into the
two-guard spot in Evans’
three—two offensive zone
against the Hoya’s defensive
zone.

“There are times when we
can use Brock against
zones," Evans said of the
former walk-on known for
his shooting.

Brush, whose contribu-
tions off the bench have
been immense all season
long, started for the flu—bit-
ten Mobley at the center
spot.

On paper, Brush con-
tributed four points and five
rebounds, but as he has
been doing all season long,
Brush’s intangible contribu-
tions proved to be his most
valuable asset.

“With Brian in there, we’re
more active — he talks a
lot,” McNeal said. “He
brings enthusiasm.”

“Brian gave us a great lift.
He got us going,” Antigua
said. “He’s a great role play-
er.”

Brush was pulled out of
the game down the stretch
for Mobley, whom the
Panthers looked to on the
play after Brown’s turnover.

Mobley was fouled
and promptly missed
his two free throws, but
McNeal ran down the sec-
ond one and he too was
fouled.

In his last game in front of
the home crowd, the senior
nailed one shot to cut the
Hoya lead to one at 48-47.
Georgetown first-year player
Duane Spencer grabbed
McNeal’s second shot and
was fouled by Antoine
Jones. But Spencer could
not convert his one-and-

one, as McNeal once
again grabbed a key
rebound.

This time‘ “Big Daddy” hit
both free throws and put
the Panthers up 49-48 with
eight ticks remaining on the
clock.

Georgetown’s two ensuing
timeouts proved fruitless
as McCullough once
again found himself in a
position to live up to his
nickname.

McCullough iced two more
free throws with 5.8 seconds
left to give the Panthers the
51-48 win.

“The team said to me at
the bench that if we want
anyone to win or lose the
game, it was you,”
McCullough said. “So I
guess they put the ball in
my hands to make the last
two shots.”

THE PI'lT NEWS, Mongay, March 1, 1995

Antigua
Continued from page 7
for today, and I just have to
continue doing what I’ve

been doing.”

After starting 18 games at
small forward last season
and developing into an
invaluable role player,
Antigua has spent most of
his sophomore campaign
watching from the bench,
averaging just 11 minutes
per game.

But Pitt has fallen on hard
times of late, and Panther
head coach Paul Evans felt
the need to shake up his
fading crew. With NCAA
Tournament hopes in jeop-
ardy, Evans felt a lineup
changewas in order, a
change that would restore
confidence and again stoke
a smoldering fire.

So yesterday Antigua
made his first start of the
season — at the unfamiliar
guard spot. Evans inserted
Antigua into the lineup in
place of Ahmad Shareef, and
the result was typical
Antigua —— an inspiring dis-
play of guts and enthusiasm
on both ends of the floor.

“He did it all last year.
This is just what you saw
last year from Orlando,”
point guard Jerry

McCullough said. “He gives
the hustle, he can score
points - that’s what makes
him a threat. He blocks
shots, and today he did
most of those things.”

Antigua has watched
senior Antoine Jones log the
large majority of minutes at
small forward all season,
and this should have been
his afternoon of personal
satisfaction. But that is not
part of Antigua’s selfless
mindset, as all season he
has maintained a constant
upbeat attitude despite a
significantly reduced role.

“I guess it’s just part of my
character,” Antigua said. “I
want the team to do well,
and if I can’t be out there, I
use my energy to try to help
motivate the other players.”

Against the Hoyas, he
sparked Pitt with nine
points and seven rebounds
in 26 minutes. Antigua dis-
played his trademark hus-
tling style and helped the
Panthers to a 38-51
rebounding margin.
Crashing the boards is
something Antigua takes
great pride in doing.

“I would say it’s a state of
desire, a state of heart,”
Antigua said. “You just have

to come out there, you gotta
want it more than they do. I
think we came out there
and we showed that.”

Pitt may have shown its
desperation, but at times,
not much more than that. In
an ugly first half marked by
miserable shooting, Antigua
sparked Pitt, hitting three
big field goals and aggres-
sively attacking the glass.
He finished off an 8-0 Pitt
run that closed the half by
canning a pretty pull-up
jumper off the dribble for a
24-20 Pitt lead.

“Orlando did a very good
job for us, especially the
first half,” Evans said. “He
gave us some good offense,
some spark and he rebound-
ed very well for us.”

Evans also cited Antigua’s
relentless defensive effort.
Pitt employed a zone
defense, hoping to take
advantage of Georgetown’s
shooting troubles, and the
Hoyas struggled, connecting
on just 19 of 57 field goals
(33 percent). Evans credited
Antigua and Brian Brush,
who both played the zone
very actively while keeping
their teammates in the flow.

However, Antigua’s sec-
ond-half contribution came

in small doses, largely due
to almost 12-and—a-half min-
utes spent on the bench.
With 12:35 remaining,
Antigua and an ailing Eric
Mobley left the game for
Brock Generalovich and
Brush. Antigua did not
return to the fray until the
final minute of the game but
credited Generalovich rather
than questioning the substi-
tution pattern.

“I think because Brock got
in there and had the rhythm
going,” Antigua said. “You
don’t want to take out a
shooter when he has his
rhythm going.”

Before intercepting that
final pass, Antigua also
managed to keep alive
a crucial offensive rebound,
tipping it back to
Chris McNeal after McNeal
missed ‘the front end of a
one-and-one with Pitt up
49-48.

That forced another
Hoya foul and allowed
McCullough to seal the deal
with two free throws.

It was just another invalu-
able Antigua contribution.
But that forgotten play per-
haps best exemplified the
performance of Pitt’s forgot-
ten soldier.

long there hasn’t been a
game where Erin hasn’t
produced for us.”

The win came on
Senior Day, the final
chance for Pitt seniors to
play at home.

In pregame ceremonies
the university presented
plaques and roses to the
four nonreturning mem-
bers of the team,
McElhinny, Ransom, Lisa

Fessler and Tiffany
Fingers.

“It’s an emotional after-
noon,” Bruce said.

“Everyone wants to do so
well for the seniors.”

When asked if she
went out the way she
wanted, McE1hinny was
emphatic.

“Yes, most definitely,”
she said. “We went out
with a victory — it
doesn’t matter if it was
one point, two points,
whatever.”

“Yes, [we went out]
with a win,” Ransom
said. “However we got it
I don’t care, but as long
as we won, it made the
day.”
