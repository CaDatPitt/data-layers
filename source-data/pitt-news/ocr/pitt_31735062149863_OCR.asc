Fraternities to Accpiaint

Frosh with Campus Life

Dance, Style Clinic
Highlight Program

To acquaint freshman men
with the fraternity system at the
University, the Interfraternity
council next week will open a
freshman fraternity program,
the first of its kind ever to take
place at Pitt.

“All freshman men are urged to
attend the functions, which will be
free, and question fraternity men,
who will be identiﬁed by .bouton-
nieres, on campus,” declares Jack
Stauﬁ, C42, chairman of the pro-
gram.

A tea dance to which all fresh-
man men, fraternity men, and all
women are invited will be held at
the Webster Hall hotel Monday
from 3 to 5:30 o’clock. No admis-
sion. will be charged but men will
have to identify themselves.

A free men’s “style cl.inic” to
which. all University students are
invited, will open in the Stephen
Foster Memorial, Wednesday at 1
o’clock. _

“The purpose of the ‘clinic,’ ”
claims Stauﬁ, “is to show college
men "how todress in good taste and
inexpensively. Everyone is invited
and .there will be no charge.”

The freshman‘ fraternity program,
which is expected to eliminate the
confusion of pledging by acquaint-
ing the freshman with‘ fraternities
before he c_onsiders joining, will be
an annual event, ’ according to
Stauff. ~ ' ‘

Members of/_ the program com-
mittee, exclusive of the chairman,
include: ' ‘Roy’ Ruan_e,I‘ ’ C42; MOIW
Dietz, C43‘,‘a’n_d Edgar Cooke, C41.

Hospital Aid
Deadline Nears

Enrollees Must Pay‘
Fee by Next Tuesday

All students enrolled under the
Pitt News-Student Health Service
Hospitalization plan must pay their
ﬁrst semester’«s fees‘, amounting to
$2.50, before next Tuesday at» the
treasurer’s .office,_ 7 State. hall. ,

In order to be protected under
the plan, a student must do BOTH
of the following. things: ,

(1) Sign a blue card of appli-
cation, recording your intention to
enroll in the plan. (Students who
have not signed these blue cards,
but who want hospitalization insur-
ance may get applications at the

  

(2) Complete“ the  in

paying $2.50 a semester, the ﬁrst

of which payments must be made"

before October 1.

"Immediately upon payment, the
student becomes the holder of a
hospitalization insurance‘ a policy,
which gives him 21 days of hospi-
talization in any of Pittsburgh’s 25
largest hospitals.

Students who signed up for the
plan when it was introduced on
campus last spring are urged to
make the $2.50 payment before next
Tu.esday’s deadline, since the ﬁling
of an application means nothing
unless it is now followed up with
the fee payment.

Heads of the News and Health
service, organizations sponsoring
the drive, said today, “Failure to
pay before Tuesday means that you
have no protection whatever, even
if you did apply for hospitalization
insurance last spring.

Phi Gamma Delta Gets Trophy
As Druids Tap F ice At Smoker

Five sophomore men were tapped
into Druids, national honorary ac-
tivities fraternity for sophomore
men, Wednesday as over 400 fresh-
men gathered at Logan armory to

tivities and meet campus leaders at
the annual Druid smoker.

Chosen on the basis of scholar-
ship, activities, and personality, the
men were initiated and welcomed
into the fraternity by Charles
Cusick, BA43, president.

Those tapped and their activ-
ities were Fred Lange, C43, Pitt

Engineering and Mines freshmen
will be staged in 332 Cathedral next
Tuesday at 11:30 o’clock.

Dr. Davenport Hooker, professor

Reverend Shadrach Meshach
Abednigo Jc-nes, who “finally re-
sembles” a certain professor in the
School of Business Administration,

Called Love.” As a part of the pro-
gram James Potts, director of intra-
mural athletics, presented the all-
point trophy for intramural sports
to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.
Serving of refreshments and visit-
ing of the 17 activity booths con-
cluded the evenings program.

Five men were tapped instead of
the’ customary four, sinhe Robert
Osterloh, who was tapped last
spring, has withdrawn from school.

Medical Students
To Attend Dance

Students in the School of Medi-
cine will attend a dance tomorrow
evening at the Churchill Valley
Country club, sponsored by the in-
terfraternity council.

Last night freshman students
were introduced to upperclassmen
and faculty members at the an-
nual Students’ Medical society
smoker in Heinz house. Dr. Wil-
liaam S. McE]lroy, dean of the
School of Medicine and professor
of physiological chemistry, spoke
to the group. Richard Home was
chairman of the affair.

rections:

“Take U.S. 22 to Lancaster,
Ohio; from there U. S. 133 will
take you straight to Columbus

books are sold in the exchange.

No?--No!
It Didn’t Happpen
Here, Or Did It?

As is well known, the CA Howdy
Hop was not held last Wednesday,
September 25.

The reasons for this are perfect-
ly obvious.

The ﬁrst campus dance of the
season was to have been held in the
Hotel Webster hall. Well, Hotel
Webster hall is not approved by
the social committee. of SFA. So
the dance was not held there.

And a ruling for hostesses pro-
vides for University hostesses, not
house mother hostesses. So the CA
planned on house mothers and
didn’t hold the dance.

Also they were supposed to reg-
ister with somebody or other and
they didn’t do that.

It is quite obvious to all who
were at the dance that the CA
Howdy Hop was not held, officially
at least.

Injuries Keep
J ones, Gervelis

On ‘Bench’ List

By BILL lVIcELWAIN
Sports Editor

Fully equipped with a supply
of dire forebodings, injured
stars, towels for head coach
-.Charlcy Bowser to sob into, and

s all the other absolute requisites

for the proper opening of a col-
_,_legc football season, the Pitt
'§Pa11the1*s, 1940’ ‘edition, entrain
this morning for Columbus, O.,
‘where they oppose the favored Ohio
State Buckeyes tomorrow after-
noon.
Both coaches, Bowser and Ohio
State’s Francis Schmidt, eye the
battle with trepidation. Bowser’s
eleven may enter the game without
the services of Edgar Jones, bril-
liant junior left halfback, and Stan
G—ervelis, clean-blocking junior end.
Schmidt, with nearly his entire
squad of Big Ten 1939 crown wear-
ers returning, is worrying over a
twisted ankle suffered by, left half
Jim Strausbaugh. Schmidt is also
complaining that his Buckeyes are
not four deep at all positions, hav-
ing no more than two good men for
two or three spots.

Saksa for Jones

However conjectural Straus-
baug‘h’s and Gervelis’ woes may be,
the Jones boy really seems to be a
"problem. Eddie has continually
denied that he will be unable to

start, but Bowser has held the
Scranton ﬂash out of scrimmages
ever since. last Saturday when
Jones aggravated an old injury, first
received in his high school days. _

Should Jones be riding the bench
at 2:01 o’clock tomorrow afternoon,
Frank Saksa, ‘sophomore passing

£_a_ce from North Braddock, will take
his place. Both Saksa and Jones
have given the Pitt air attack a real
shot in the arm, but Jones has a
big edge over Saksa as a runner.
The sophomore has considerable
drive but lacks Eddie’s shiftiness.

Jones has been the sparkplug of
the ﬁrst team’s attack during the
entire fall practice drive, and his
absence would be bound to be felt.
With Saksa as a starter, the second
string would be ﬁlled by another
sophomore. Jack Stetler, Shaler
township speedster. In the past
two weeks Stetler has also m.ade
considerable progress as a passer.

Gervelis May Play

Chances that both Gervelis and
Strausbaugh will be in there at the
start are high. Stan was banged up
about two weeks ago and has been
rested frequently since, but should
have recovered enough by tomor-
row afternoon to go to work on the
Buckeye right tackle. Straus-
baugh’s bad ankle may have been
a coincidence but temporarily served
to take a little pressure off the high-

Opening a year of activities, the
University YM and YWCA will
stage a fall frolic at the farm house
in Highland park today from 2
until 10 o’clock.

Tennis, mushball, volleyball, and
horseshoes are on the afternoon
program, while dinner, monopoly,

Pitt Band Hopes
To Out-Maneuver
Ohio Musicians

Pitt’s attempts to out-maneuver
Ohio State’s gridders tomorrow will
not slow down when the ﬁrst half
ends, and the ‘battle of the bands”
gets under way.

Tomorrows display promises to
be "a re-al “contest of champions,”
since the Pitt Band in recent
years has been classed as “the best
college band in the East,” while
Ohio State’s band is regarded as one

of the top-ﬂight. musical organiza-

tions in the country.

Both bands have been drilling
iard the past few weeks, each re-
hearsfng part of one mammoth for-
mation which will feature both
bands’. The formation will show

about 400. men, playing the ‘Star...

Spangled Banner” before the game.

Following the game both organi-
zations will attend a reception,
given by the Ohio State band in
honor of the Pitt musicians.

Bettors . . .

Ask First Panther:
Aintcha Comin’ Out?

Frank S. Mil1er’s ﬁrst Panther
made a belated appearance today.
Although the betting boys saw the
Panther, felt it and read it, they
were still wagering 2 to 1 that no
campus humor magazine had been
published.

The Pitt News, always on the
alert to aid innocent inmates, de-
tails the formula for recognizing
the Panther. It has a cover—it’s
all wrong, but it’s a cover. It has
ads, which is a good thing for
Panther custom.ers—-the ads keep
the cost price down. President
Roosevelt comes to the University,
by courtesy of “the staff.”

The Robert Gestrich touch—just
like Lubitsch—-smudges page after
page. Business Manager Alvin
Gross promises an eraser with sub-
sequent issue-for the Gestrich
touch, of course.

Oscar Sheﬂer and Kal Kalwary
and some other questionable char-
acters supply some ﬁller.

Symphony Orchestra
Plans First Rehearsal

First rehearsal of the University
Symphony orchestra will take place
Tuesday evening, October 1, at 7
o’clock in 2317 Cathedral, announc-
es Walt-er Logan, C41, student man-
ager. ,

Freshman women are permitted
to participate and tryouts are not
required.

Oboeists, cellists, and violinists
are especially needed this year.

Woven Linen Cloth to Cover
Walls of Lithuanian Room

The tenth in the Universit.y’s ser-
ies of nationality rooms will be ded-
icated next Friday evening when
the Lithuanian room becomes an
integral part of Pitt.

The room, which is now the third
“Russian” room in the Cathedral,
is unique in its use of linen woven
in a design. “The Path of Birds”
was taken from the museum at
Kaunas, Lithuania, and made by
Lithuanian women. The cloth will
be used as a wall covering.

-Finished in oak, the room will

have a door made of diagonally—laid
oak planks with a carved rosette in
the center. The floor and wains-
coting will be ﬁnished in light oak
in contrast to the black oak trim-
mings.

Also in the Lithuanian room are
an old household table which will
be used as a proiess’o1"s desk, a
fresco in the rear wall with a paint-
ing based on an old Lithuanian
story of “The Two Kings,” and
windows containing leaded medal-
lions symbolic of the sun.

A Policy Is Tested

Nothing can be fairly judged on the basis of
8. ﬁrst. year trial.

Such is the case with the University’s “noble
experiment” in football. Last year Dr. John llain
Sutherland had just given way to Chisel Bowser
as head coach, the squad had a definite “caste”
system with seniors, juniors. and sophomores all
coming under different degrees of subsidization,
and "a large number of pro-Sutherland sports
writers had their knives out, ready to slash at the
least" pretext.

Tomorrow the Panthers open a difficult eight
game schedule at Columbus, Ohio. Athletically it
will be one of the most rigorous campaigns ever
engaged in by a Pitt. team. But more than that,
it will mark the opening of the real test. year for
the University’s drastically revised football pol-
icy.‘ ' To be specific, the policy applies to all sports,
butthe revamping of the football setup was so
complete as to focus interest chieﬂy on that branch
of xathletfics.

‘ To the relief of practically all concerned, the
outlook is at least hopeful. Bowser has had a
full year in which to get to know his players, the
caste. system has been broken down to the point
where only the seniors are out—and-out scholar-
ship men, and the Sutherland-was-kicked-out club
has gradually become less and less voluble.
latt'er group was qu‘ieted somewhat by Jock-’s de-
ci.,Si,oi1 to move over  professional ranks, although
iI;.is,not inconceivable that they will be readyjto
shout “I told you so" if the silent Scot’s Brook-

lyn.".I)otlgc+.rs have an_vwl1.ere‘near the _s_1_icce_ss_ o_f__;g_

tile teams. .

'“r*-Barring the latter possibility, the way seems

We View With Alarm

 ..It is with slight shudderings that we re-admit
“Senator” Ziskind to the columns of the News.
Last year, the Senator’s Cassandra-like utterings
brought forth everything from laughter to Letters
to the Editor, depending on how persons viewed his
single-handed jousts with “Shicky,” “Musso,”
and “Dirty Joe,” as Dr. Tyson so playfully calls
Europe ’s terrible three. This year, we editorially
preface the Senator’s battles with this advice: Go
in thereand ﬁght, fella, but keep it clean.’ Peace,
 wonderful, even in a college newspaper.

\ Prodigal Miamian Fears
| Face Powder--Not Guns!

by Marjorie Munroe and Roy Ruane
Face powder will put more Pitt men down and
out this year than gun powder, says Herbie Hochstet-
ter, as he eyes the fresh beauty of the fresh cuties . . .
He should know his women after lolling in the Unversity
of Miami, where the fascinating frolicking females are
famous . . . Joe Hammer refuses to spare time to com-
ment, but his actions indicate approval of the wearers
of the green arm bands . . . He is offering free cokes
for introductions to some of the new pretties that are
cluttering up the campus . . . Bob McVey came down
from the med school to collect a few frosh addresses.

Stink Was the Rage

1). J. (Stinky) Baily and Skunk Hollow boys, Jack
Stauff and Gus Wilde were the stage hands and deco-
rators of a smelly scene at frosh camp . . They
tied a pink ribbon to a skunk, a string to its head and
tail and dangled the perfumed pussy over the heads
of sleeping buddies. (Now ex-buddies). We believe
that it was by mistake that the nose of faculty ad-
viser Ted Parker was stenched . . . Instead of teach-
ing history, thc peaceful prof made it!

Former Pittpouri dirt slinger and tennis champ Joe
Kristufek is still clinging to his seat in the Tuck Shop

. . Joe has closed his tennis shop and is awaiting an
OK to report to Randolph Field.

sister who dates an air pilot has returned with some

when she came to Pitt campus last spring; it wasn’t
love at ﬁrst sight, but Tom wanted a second look . . .
He got it but found that long distance courting costs
money and isn’t so protable__.. .. . After his most recent
trip to ‘Celluloid city, Arleen left Tom moaning . . . She

ly favored State eleven. The odds
are that jolting Jim will carry on as
usual.

Replacements for the pair would
be senior Al Gurczenski, a made-
over tackle with pass catching o'e-
ﬁciencies, replacing Gervelis, and
triple-threater Dick Fisher backing
up Strausbaugh. Both boys will
be in before the game is half over,
even if they do not start.

Aside from the holes caused by
injuries, key spot for the Panthers
will be fullback where George Kra-
cum, last year a left halfback, has
added 20 pounds and terriﬁc drive
to a weak spot in the 1939 lineup.
Kracum will also do much of the
Pitt passing, throwing either to
the ends or right half Bobby Thur-
bon, Erie veteran.

Plenty of Halfbacks

John Ross and Joe Connell, both
juniors, are running two-three in
Connell started
a game or two last year while Ross,
a potentially ﬁne ball player, has
been held back by difficulty in mast-
ering his shifts. Behind Thurbon
-come hard—driving Ernie Bonelli
and snake-hipped Bill Dutton. The
three sets of halfbacks make Pitt
stronger at that point than the
Panthers have been in several sea-
sons.

Starting‘ Ht , ‘quarterback will be, ,
Windber Mike Sekela, an experi-'

enced sen_i_or who has suddenly de-
veloped place-kicking talents to add
to his value. Reserve forces for
Mike are 'l‘ommy Murphy and Walt
West, who have taken turns in the
past few days at‘ running the ’sec-

ond team. Murphy is a superior

line backer but West has the edge
in blocking.

Coach Eyes Grady Must Rebuild Squad
After Graduation Takes Toll

First Year Men
Please Kliskey
In Early Drills

Early practice sessions of the
1940 Pitt freshman football squad
have almost shocked Coach Nick
Kliskey out of his persistent pes-
simism as Panther cubs parade their
accomplishments before the Pitt
staff.

Sixty—three potential Goldbergs
and Daddios have reported for duty
thus far, with more expected in the
next few days. Brightened by the
familiar names of Skladany and
Sinco, the Pitt roster includes boys
who have proved their athletic
prowess in high school ball and need
only live up to their reputations to
click with future Pitt machines.

And this squad includes -boys
whose -courage and determination
are enough to overcome any deﬁc-
iency in natural ability. One of
the Panther cubs, Ripple, nudges
the scales at a bare 135. Like many
others in this spirited group, the
little fellow is determined to endure
the grind as long as he has a chance
to play and to help the school.

As the future Panthers run

through their. drills under the watch-

ful eyes ofrlthe Freshman coaching
staff, theirefforts do not pass un-
noticed by head man Charley Bows-
er. Pitt’s chief-of-staff is vitally
concerned with theprogress of the
frosh squad and shows it by his
frequent strolls across the hilltop
ﬁeld to give advice and inspiration.
Though the drills have been lim-
ited so far to practice in a few
simple plays, the Panther coaching
staff is making certain that the boys
learn their assignments thoroughly.
And the Panther cubs, catching the
spirit of the varsity, are digging in
-for the long-siege of drills with en-
thusiasm. : . : , _ .
Depending on the number of b.oys
who stay with the squad and the
progress they "make, an intra-squad
league will ‘be ‘formed within the
next few weeks, I ‘ ‘ '

Ben Grady, coach of last year’s
pions, now ﬁnds himself face to
face with the annual job of rebuild-
ing and reshaping a squad that has
been stripped of most of its power
by graduation. With this in mind
Grady has set Monday, October 7,
at 3 o'clock as the day for all var-
sity and freshmen swimming can-
didates to report for the ﬁrst ses-
sion of the new year at Trees Pool.

A quartet of returning veterans,
consisting of Herb Cosgrove, East-
ern Collegiate breast stroke cham-
pion, Joe Orloff, 50 and 100 yard
free style runner-up, Dick Ames,
who placed second in the diving
events, and free styler A1 Samson,
will be the foundation around which
Grady expects to build this year’s
squad.

Moving up from last year’s re-
serve squad will be Joe Kaule, Al
Fedor, Marty Kramer, and Vity
Schulness. Bob Schultz, Gus
Wilde, Tony Notaro, Bob Jackson,
and Bob Soles are ready to blitz-
kreig any and all of the lettermen
in the splashing battle for regular
positions.

Edward Popiel, swimming man-
ager, has requested those interested
in becoming his assistants, to report
at the same time as the swimming
candidates.

Coach Grady also announces that

Faculty Gets Opportunity
For Group Hospitalization

In line with the popular current
student hospitalization plan offered
to University students, members of
the faculty are again given an op-
portunity to participate in a group
hospitalization service this week.

This plan, made available to em-
ployees of the University through
the Hospital Service association of
Pittsburgh, a non-proﬁt community
project, is carried out through the
University only in the exception that
it must supply the necessary
clerical expense incident to carry-
ing out the payroll deductions and
remitting these deductions monthly
to the association.

The monthly subscription charges
are as follows: Individual, $.75;
husband and wife, $1.40; and fam-
ily, $1.75. "

Inasmuch as the Hospital Service
association must be paid monthly
for 12 months, the University has
adopted a program of salary deduc-
tion whereby the 12 monthly ac-
cumulations will be obtained in 10
months (September to June).

H. E. Daer, assistant bursar, an-
nounced that all faculty members
interested in this group plan must
call at the treasurer’s office before
Monday.

bration was an inspiring event.
The program was certainly rich in
speakers and material.”

Commenting on Dr. lVloulton’s ad-
dress on “Wartime Price Controls”
Dr. Tyson believed that “economics
would have wished that Dr. Moul-
ton had had time to review the
problem of general innovating pro-
grams of control. Perhaps only a
general program such as that ad-
vanced by John Maynard Kaynes
for Great Britain could deter or pre-
vent wartime inﬂation or postwar
deﬂation, with all their disturbing
ills.”

This tenth anniversary banquet
of the Falk foundation sounded the
keynote of discussion for business-
men and students alike. Will
students ﬁnd their living expenses
increasing‘ during the next year?
Will the new “war generation” ride
on the crest of a speculative boom‘!

Cum pus Dictionary Introduces

Famed Six Lessons of Adam L——

By Oscar Sheﬂer

(Editor’s note: This is the third.
in the ‘series of space-ﬁllers known
as the campus dictionary.)

A small man giving his initials as
A. L. walked into the News office
the other day. Offering to lend as-
sistance to the paper’s campaign to
supplement the orientation pro-
gram, the smartly-dressed little
gentleman diyulged the following
information:

Lesson one, is for the chronic
waiter-upon-elevators. Our shrunk-

' en friend advises the freshman to

prepare ﬁrst a chart computing the
average speed of each elevator,
having ﬁrst numbered these from
one to eight. Following this, the
mulling martyr is to stand before
any pre-selected door and, at the
ﬁrst appearance of a car travelling
in the opposite direction from the
one he desires, to set his stopwatch
into motion. When, ﬁfteen minutes
later, the elevator zooms past with
a full load, he is to set his stop-
watch upon the ﬂoor, grind it
slowly with his right heel, and
shred, not rip, his speedograph into
thirty-two sections of equal size.
‘Campus Queen’ Query

Lesson two, is for the ediﬁcation
of the student who is unfortunate
enough to have left his cigarettes in
his other suit. (Editor’s note: Ha,
ha.) Demonstrating his technique,

the gentleman, whom we shall
henceforward refer to as A.L.,
reached into a side-pocket, pro-

duced an_ empty‘, pack of cigarettes,
and sighed soulfully and long.‘ We
immediately offered him one of our
own, upon which he referred to us
as an excellent example of the spe-
cies suckerus suckerum.

Intended for the co-ed is lesson
three, involves a burning question,
not to be confused with the institu-
tion now being presented at the
Art Cinema. The question, “How
can I become Senior Queen?” was
lengthily answered by A.L., not to
be confused with Abe Lincoln or
the American Legion. First step
in the process is the bonﬁre. In
this, the hopeful candidate should
‘look through her wardrobe and
gather therefrom all articles of a
crimson hue. These should be
baled, set in a neat pile on the
campus lawn, and burned in a most
conspicuous fashion.

Cutting Remark

Lesson four, makes cutting re-
marks in regard to?‘ the subject of
voluntary absence from classes. In
those assemblages where roll is by

the expedient of passing a sheet of
paper around the class, the services
of an expert calligrapher may be
enlisted at a nominal fee. Under
the oral system, track stars may be
employed to ﬂit from seat to seat,
yelling alternately “here,” “Pres-
ent,” and “I believe myself to be
within the conﬁnes speciﬁed.” This
system reached its full prominence
at a certain convention in Phila-
delphia.
On Getting Tickets

For those who would procure
books from the University library,
there is lesson ﬁve. In this process,
the student should ﬁrst equip him-
self with a mattress, two warm
blankets of the Freshman camp
type, soap, towels, toothbrush,
razor, and provisions for a period
of six months. He is then to rush,
with his equipment, to all the li-
brary rooms, screaming in a shrill,
untraceable falsetto, “Fire, ﬁre, the
building’s on ﬁre.” It may take a
bit of nudging to rouse the faculty
from their seats. Here, as an al-
ternate means, the culprit may
merely whisper, “Tenure.”

Lesson six, lists ways and means
of ﬁnding ticket salesmen for the
current campus shindig. The
method here is merely to walk down
the ground ﬂoor corridor waving
a ﬂock of dollar-bills in one hand
and wearing a naive expression.
Buyers are warned against this pro-
cedure on days when the Panther is
on sale, Dr. Carlson stating that any
injuries thus received will not be
taken care of under the Student
Hospitalization Plan.
