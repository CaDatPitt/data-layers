No sale

-Are magazine sellers legit?-

By Alison _ Sterne and
Dan Bates
The Pitt News

Jackie O’Malley, a Pitt student,
was sitting outside of the student
union enjoyingrthe Friday sunshine
when two men sat down next to her;
They introduced themselves. They
were trying to sell her’ magazines.
She maybe lucky that she declined.

Thirty-five magazine salesmen.

have been confronting young
women on the Pitt campus for the
past two weeks. They tell their pros-
‘ pective buyers that they are involved

in a contest and get points for each .

magazine that they sell. . - .
Summit Publications, based in
.Houston, Texas, is supposedly

Breakdowns

Pitt students are getting stuck with faulty eleva-
tors. ‘

behind this ‘contest. One hundred

and fifty people are selected~to par-_

ticipate in the twelve-week drive to

sell magazines. Each. magazine. is -

worth a certain number of points. It
takes 20,000 points to win the con-
test; the winner receives $1,000 and a
trip to Europe. '
So, what's wrong with such a con-
test? Reportedly, the buyer never

gets his magazine. a

Gerard Cinigliano, a Pitt student,
said that his girlfriend__ was
approached by two men who asked
for her money onvthe spot. He said
she believed the contest pitch and
paid for a subscripti_on but has not
seen any magazines.

O’Malley agreed that the sales-
man who approached. her had
requested cash up front. “I just told

them that I didn't have any money
with me._”

Another Pitt female reported that
she had told two magazine salesmen
the same thing. After they found out
that she didn't have any money with
her, they offered to walk her to her
bank.

The two" salesmen who

approached O’Malley and the.

second student said others may be

ripping off students butginsisted that '
their operation was legitimate.

Robert Bronson‘ and Tim Leven-

Foreign affairs
Call for  -

world stability  

By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

A speaker appearing before the
World Affairs Council declared this
to be a time in which the coming
presidential election holds “extraor-
dinary import" for foreign affairs.
Mondale had, through his perfor-
mance in the first presidential
debate, “burst the bubble” and
proven himself to be a “strong
leader, strong in foreign affairs."

The National Director of the
Democratic National Committee,
Michael R. Steed, addressed the.
World Affairs Council of Pittsburgh

» this past Tuesday, reading a text

entitled “US. Foreign Policy lssuesz. .
A Democratic View.”
Steed, a native of California and

graduate of Loyola University's law .

school, spoke to an audience of civic
and business leaders and high school
students‘ at ‘Kaufrnann’s department-
store indowntown Pittsburgh. .
According to Steed, the Demo-
crats have one “simple proposal"
regarding foreign affairs: The next
Democratic president mustgreverse
the “American drift toward isola-

tion” in order to build a “stable .

world order.” .
Explaining that he did not mean
“isolationist” in its traditional mean-
ing, Steed said that under the Rea-
gan administration, the U.S. has
become a country of “Lone Rangers
and go-it-aloners.” He accused the
U.S. of moving away from full par-
ticipation in world alliances and for-
saking international responsibilities.
“There is a new sickness across the
country," said Steed, “a feeling or
attitude intolerant to change. A
right-wing ideology has taken over.”

He went on to attack the_ Reagan
administration. He said that a lack
of leadership on the part of the cur-.
rent administration has left the
country vulnerable to nuclear
extinction, the world oil cartel and
the blackmail of terrorism.

“We can be better prepared,” said
Steed.

Continuing his attack, Steed said
the Reagan administration has
adopted a confrontational style of
foreign policy with too much
emphasis on the military. He con-
demned the so-called “Star Wars"
proposal as “Fortress America” and
said the current approach to Latin
America is a “Big Stick" policy.

, “The path to follow is one of inter-
dependence,” said Steed, not Rea-
gan’s “Lone Rangerism.”

The“Democrats will slow the rate
of the Pentagon's buying “gold-
plates strategic weaponry” and
spend more on conventional forces.
Steed said the state of our conven-
tionalforces is “suicidal.”

“Arms control is not a weakness,"
Steed declared. He said effective
arms control will add predictability
to weapons planning and “save us
from nuclear nightmare.”

 Accordingto Steed, resumption
of arms talks would reassure our

allies and enable the U.S. and its V
allies to present a solid political ,,

front. Joint planning between the
U.S. and its NATO allies would be a
major thrust of the Democratic‘
policy.

We must adopt a more realistic .

view of the Soviet Union, said Steed.
According to him, they are neither
purely. evil nor just like us, and both-
the UYST and the Soviet Union have a
mutual interest in “preventing
nuclear annihilation." Immediately
upon assuming office, Steed said,
Mondale would seek a moratorium

on weapons testing and space wea- »

pons. Through “protracted negotia-
tions," Mondale would work toward

a steady decrease in nuclear wea- i

pons stockpiles.

Steed lauded the National
Endowment for Democracy, a _
group of labor unions working to’-

foster democratic institutions in

-developing countries and Eastern

Bloc nations.

Steed said a Democratic adminis-

tration would take a “genuine inter- — _

est in seeing other nations free [by

. fostering] our own values there."

In response to a question concern-
ing the hostage crisis during the Car-
ter administration, Steed said that
history would prove that Carter did
the right thing in “exercising
patience.” - v

“Under Reagan, we got 252 body
bags,” he said. “Under Carter] Mon-
dale, we had 52 people in and 52
people out.”

Steed ‘hinted at a reduction in U.S. ,
troop strength in Europe. Citing‘
Senator Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and his
repeated attempts to pull U.S. sol-
diers from Europe, Steed called for a
restructuring of the NATO alliance.-
“Europe must assume more of the

E responsibility [for its own defense].” ,

What goes up doesn’t
necessarily come down

By Greg Evanlna
For the Pitt News

On a Thursday evening two weeks
ago at around 7:30, two students
walked onto a Tower C elevator.
They didn’t walk off until approxi-
mately two hours later.

-- ‘Reports like the previous one
have been springing up from allover
Tower C lately. It seems that almost
everyone has a story to tell about
having come close to or actually
having been stuck in a Tower C
elevator. . .

These incidents have even
attracted the attention of Tower C
Resident Director Siobhan Gray-
son, who said she feels the break-

. downs are being caused by student
abuse. Last week, in an effort to
solve the problem, Grayson directed

-Fill International Inc.

FCC

   

her resident assistants to ha.ig_some
signs in the elevators. The signs,

which were posted for a few days,‘

informed residents that the elevators
are a privilege which may be perma-
nently revoked if abuse ofthem con-
tinues.

Grayson, although not responsi-
ble for the maintenance of the eleva-
tors, has taken it upon herself to
remedy the situation.

“My main concern stems from the

fact that there is alot of abuse from
the students as far as theyelevators
go. My concern is that the elevators
remain safe for all of us to use. I
didn't feel that this was the case in
many times.”

To illustrate her point, she gave
the example ofa man whom she saw
extinguish his cigarette by dropping
it down the elevator shaft, thereby
causing a fire hazard.

Grayson stresses that incidents
like this are caused by a minority of
the students. However, she says that
in a sense, the majority of students
are at fault for not reporting or try-
ing to stop the abusers. A

At Sunday night’s Tower C Resi-
dent Student Association meeting,
Grayson proposed a measure
designed to make everyone appre-
ciate the elevators. Grayson feels
that residents would learn to take
better care of the elevators if they
were turned off for a weekend. “It’s
been my experience throughout life
that when people are deprived of
something, they finally realize how
much use it is to them,” Grayson
said. Turning off the elevators, she
admits, is a little extreme and proba-
bly will not happen.’

Over 2,000 years of tradition and
culture will be brought to Pittsburgh
when the Chinese Magic Revue of
Taiwan appears at Soldiers and Sai-
lors Memorial Hall on Tuesday,
Oct. l6. _
dancers and acrobats, the Chinese
Magic Revue consists of a group of
highly trained and disciplined artists
performing feats of balance, acro-
batics, Chinese magic, comedy,
kung fu, chi kung and more.

Also included in the performance
are brilliantly costumed folk dances
that, like most of the other acts in
this show, were created and per-
formed by the Chinese in the second
century B.C. and still remain an inte-
gral part of the Chinese cultural
today.

Training to become a member of
the acrobatic team is a family affair,
usually taken up by the children of
the performers themselves. The
children spend some four hours each
day going through their paces so
that by the time they re’ach’the age of
l4 or 15, their art has become a part
of their daily lives, virtually second
nature. .

Part of that training includes the
cultivation of “Chi,” roughly trans-
lated as “inner strength” or “life
energy.” Chi is an ancient concept in
the Orient,- the achievement of per-
feetion' through finding harmony
between mind and body. '

In all of theiracts, the performers
of the magic revue attempt to dem-
onstrate this perfection with a mix-
ture ‘of spectacle and daring. Some
of the highlights of the show include
a girl who seemingly levitates, sup-
ported only by‘the’po'int of alsword
under her neck, and a man who bal-

ances with one handon atower of ,

six chairs that rest on four wine
bottles.

But she still is adamant in her
_ quest formore dependableelevators
in Tower C. “I guess I took on this
crusade because I do live in the
building also and I want to feel safe
when I get on an elevator that I'm
going to get off on my floor. I think
that all I can ask as a resident direc-
tor is that everybody be more con-
scious of'the- use of the elevators.”
So, the controversy continues
over whom to blame — the elevators
or the students -— for the break-
downs. Untila solution is found, res-
idents of Tower C are going to have
to put up with a lack of elevator
service. .

Public Matter

Bishop James W. Malone, president of the U.S. Catholic
Conference, stated on Saturday that “as a nation we are consti-
tutionally committed to the separation of church and state, but
not to the separation of religious and moral values from public
life.” Malone accurately perceives the need for moral integrity
in our public life and among decision makers though he creates
the impression that Catholicism is the representative religion of
the American nation.

The bishop declared, “We [the U.S. Catholic Conference] do
not seek the formation ofa voting bloc nor do we preempt the
right and duty of individuals to decide conscientiously whom
they will support for public office.” It is easy to say that a group

the size of the conference does not intend to become a voting —

bloc. lfthat is in fact the case, why was Bishop Malone asked by
the conference’s administrative board to issue a statement
“reaffirming the conference’s position on the question of reli-
gion and politics?” The conference has taken a stand on politi-
cal issues that it views to be inseparable from religious beliefs.
Rather than use the term “voting bloc,” let us say that the
conference has become a normative interest group.

The prevention of nuclear war and the opposition to abor-
tion are issues that, according to Bishop Malone, cannot be
separated from public life. The prevention of nuclear war is

obviously inseparable from publicilife. A state of war affects ‘

each and all simultaneously, more directly than indirectly.
Abortion is an event that most directly affects the individual. It
is an issue that affects the public when it chooses to beaffected,
or if abortion is not a legal option and the unwanted child
becomes a social burden. ,

The philosophical, moral, and legal arguments for and
against an arms race, for and against abortion, are valid and
complex issues to examine the situations of non-war and non-
abortion. In the case made by Bishop Malone on abortion, we
need to ask: “Is it still a matter of public life when a woman

‘ gives birth to an unwanted child and has no means with which

to support the child? is it a public concern when a 12-year-old
girl is raped and becomes pregnant? In both examples, an
emphatic yes, these are issues of public concern. The public,
however, is not as vocal about accepting this type of
responsibility.

«Faced with these types of modern problems, it has become a
necessity for policy makers to employ a firm sense of morality
in their decision making. At the same time, these decision
makers should not be overly‘ inﬂuenced by an organized reli-
gious constituency. it is honorable for Catholics, Protestants,
Baptists and Buddhists to oppose abortion or nuclear war.
Even more honorable are the attempts made by church groups

‘ to eliminate poverty, crime, drug abuse and general despair

often attributable to overpopulationrand economic injustice.
However, one church among a myriad of others need not

impose its practices upon people outside of its group nor

attempt to influence legislatures.

Letters i  to the Editor

On Jan.,9, 1984, a subcommittee
of the Senate Budget Policies Com-

mittee reported theresults of its two- '

year study of the practice plans of
the School of Medicine. The report
was called the Pratt Report after the

chairman, Dr. Richard Pratt, of the A

committee that conducted the study.
._The practice plans are the secret pri-
vate corporations that the clinical
departments in the medical school
formed over the past decade; their
purpose and effect, in the words of
the Pratt Report, have been to
return‘ almost all practice plan
incomes to the department that
earns them. According to the report,
this has created an “unbalanced
institution where some departments
are free to grow without obvious
limit," fueled by whatever practice
plan income they can generate.
While some departments ﬂourish,
others, like medicine, are running
chronic- million-dollar annual
deficits.

Dr. Robert Olson, then associate
dean for academic affairs in the

School of Medicine, was abruptly‘

ﬁred by Dean.Leon because he had
openly challenged the dean's asser-
tion that ~l2 percent of the practice
plan resources were being channeled
into the hard operating budget of the
School of Medicine; Olson, with
access to the same data used by the
dean, concluded that the practice
plans relinquished less than one per-

cent of their proﬁts to ‘university .

' budgets. Olson’s apparent misjudge-
ment, in the eyes of medical school
administrators, was that he con-

tested this issue in the presence of the ‘

vLiaison Committee on Medical

‘ Education that was ‘on an accredita-

tion site visit to the School of Medi-
cine. Olso'n wasgnot only fired for
discussing the results of his own
analysis but soon thereafter also suf-
fered the loss of a $2" million nutri-
tion grant from the Heinz
Foundation, which he had organ-
ized and written. Thus, for daring to
challenge practice» plan myths, Dr.
Olson was punished both as an
administrator and scholar-faculty
member.

Dr. Olson also rejected the claim
of the practice planchairmen that all
of the clinical departments of the
School of Medicine are self-
supporting, that is, that they do not
receive funds from the hard operat-
ing budget of the ‘medical school.
Olson cited speciﬁcally the case of

Poor Practice Plans  

ining, coordination and controliof

deficits. This year alone, the medi-
cine department isi$2.5 million in the
red, and the entirety of this deficit is
being covered by funds from the
hard operating budget of the-School
of Medicine, not from other clinical
departments that are awash in prac-
tice plan profits.

The basis for the plight of the,
medicine department is not obscure;
it is the result of a combination of
poor planning by the chairman of
medicine and imprudent and inef-
fective management of the practice
plans by the dean and the chancel-
lot. The chairman of medicine made
two fundamental mistakes; first, he
hired more facultythan the patient
load in the teaching hospitals could
support, and secondly, the people he

' recruited were either disinclined to

seek external grant support or were
of’a caliber that has madethem
uncompetitive in the grants compe-
tition. Asa result, the medicine
department is $2.5 million in the
hole. Rather than draw upon the

profits from other practice plans of ‘

the clinical departments (which
amount to more than $40 million

annually) to make up this deﬁcit, the’ '
’ dean and Chancellor Posvar chose

to pay the medicine department's
bills with hard money from univer-
sity budgets. It appears that tuition
dollars and state funds are being

used to support the expensive life-
-styles of the imbalanced, profit-

seeking practice plans. The practice
plans, as they currently operate, are
an intellectual, economic, adminis-
trative and moral embarrassment to
the state-related University of Pitts-

burgh." .

While considering these points,
, the reader should reflect on the fol-"
lowing conclusions drawn by the "

Pratt Committee: - - j
0, “There seems to be a marked

difference in perception between the 3

chairs of the clinical departments in’
the School of Medicine and proba-
bly in other schools of the university
as to the relationship bet_ween the
university - and the School of
Medicine." ' i

0 “The chairs of the individual‘

practice plans know little of the
functioning of the other plans, and
similarly, the members of the indi-
. know little
about the governance and opera-
tions of their own plans." ' '

. The report’s last conclusion was .

that there are. f‘significant weak-

   

regard: .t.

agement,.- plan-

the medical,-. {school ,‘ 

    

programs, personnel and budget.”
The persistence of the multimil-
liondollar deficitin the School of
Medicine and the Subvention of
undergraduate tuition dollars and

‘funds from the medical school’s

hard operating budget are proofthat
little has "changed these past ten
months, and that as far as the prac-
tice plans are concerned, it's laissez-
faire, business as usual. So long as
the practice plansare permitted to
travel their merry, independent
paths by a passive and disinterested
faculty and weak central administra-
tion, we will continue to witness high
and restrictive tuitions, the drain of
precious dollars from undergradu-
ate programs and the deterioration
of the basic sciences inthe School of
Medicine. ,
The inadequately supervised and
poorly regulated and coordinated
practice plans at Pitt have changed
little since the Pratt Committee drew

its conclusions and made its recom-.

Early this month the Advising
Center published the preliminary
results of the 1984 Freshman Place-
mente Tests, and the results are no
less than pathetic.

Out of 2,014 CAS freshmen, 1,137
failed the minimum competency test
for algebra. Ninety-one freshmen
failed to placeout of Basic Reading
and Writing, 754 failed to place out
of Basic Writing, and 1,142 failed to
place out of General Writing; only
l3 of the University of Pittsburgh’s
freshmen —— 0.6 percent — can read
and write at college level.

These results make one wonder
about the university’s admissions
criteria. On what basis are freshmen
accepted? Certainly not on an aca-
demic basis, for freshmen have
‘scored progressively worse on place-
ment tests over the past three years.
Interestingly enough, however,
there are 4 percent more students
enrolled in the university than there
were last year, and tuition fees have

come up with the “right” theme or
slogan with which to “galvanize the
community."

Robert Hickey, according to last
week’s (Oct. ll) University Times,
believes that “the bicentennial offers

a rare chance for the city’s children." "
He states, “the bicentennial celebra-
tion offers as much an opportunity
as the building of the Cathedral
[when children were asked to donate
10 cents for a brick] to involve the
imagination of the school children. ”

Meanwhile, the University Times
reports, “Wesley Posvar said Pitt
should do what it can to entice
national educational associations to
hold their 1987 meetings and confer-
ences in Pittsburgh.”

It would seem to me that the uni-
versity might do well to ‘fgalvanize
the community" toward a concern
for its children’s educational ability.
One can probably state without fear
of contradiction that most of west-
ern Pennsylvania’s parents hold

The Pitt News

Oakland on a Wednesday night.
Even at 10 p.m., Fifth Avenue is
crowded with people. Students are
‘walking home from classes. People
are waiting for the bus on the corner.
There are men with briefcases and
nurses in white uniforms and a
woman who is screaming. She runs
out from the darkness of University
Place. Her face is red, bleeding. She
clutches on to the arm of a passing
businessman. He pulls his arm away
and walks on. He doesn ’t look back.
She is on Fifth Avenue, pleading
amidst a sidewalk full of people. No

one stops. ‘
Oct. 17, I983

This woman is just one of the
hundreds that were assaulted in
Oakland last year. In the first six
months of 1984, according to the
Census track of reported Oakland
offenses, there were two murders,
eight rapes, I43 robberies, 243
assaults, 390 burglaries, 733 thefts
and 499 automobile thefts. Many of

e these incidents occurred because no

one cared enough to notice.

, “This is exactly the kind of situa-
tion that we are trying to prevent,”
Paul Martinelli said, shaking his
head. At 18 he is the leader of Pitts-
burgh's self-appointed anti-crime

nteres

the perfect example of a self-
indulgent society. People are look-
ing out for number one. They see the
crime happen and they don’t care.
At least we care enough to get
involved," said Martinelli.

The Guardian Angels began as a
group of people who cared enough
to defend the rights of others. They
originated in New York City in 1979
as the Magnificent 13, a group of
unarmed street-smart youth patrol-
ling the subways in an attempt to
deter crime. Six years and 5,000
members later, this organization has
expanded to include chapters in 49
cities across the country and in Can-
ada, ages 10 to 42 -— all united in the
same anti-crime effort.

The Pittsburgh chapter of the
Guardian Angels is characterized by
the same diversity. Presently there
are about 40 members, ranging
between the ages of IO and 22, men,
women, students, lab_orers, from a
multitude of Pittsburgh communi-
ties including Braddock, Home-
wood, Manchester, Ambridge, Penn
Hills and others but all wearing the
same white T-shirts and red berets.
The only other common characteris-
tic of the Angels is their youth, and it
is for this reason that they are often
discredited.

“Authorities encourage people to
get involved, and we’re criticized
because we’re young and getting
involved,” said Martinelli. “But if
you’re getting mugged, and someone
comes to save you, I don’t think
you’re going to care how oldthey
are.”

Each Angel is trained through a
10-week, nine-hour-a-week training
program. From professional
instructors they learn karate, self-
defense and the proper way to make
a citizen’s, arrest. Each is certified in
CPR to assist the elderly.

“If you take on the youth that are
committing the crime and put them
on the other side of the fence, then
you’re accomplishing something.
That is what we’re all about,” said
Martinelli.

At present the Guardian Angels
are patrolling downtown and South
Side Pittsburgh, usually in groups of
seven, armed with nothing more
lethal than a whistle, and using mar-

\ tial arts rather than weapons to

apprehend their criminals. When the
Angels do uncover a criminal sus-
pect, the action they take is, as Mar-
tinelli said, “down to a science.”One
Angel stays with the victim, one calls
the police,.one gets witnesses, and
those remaining chase thegsuspect.
The Guardian Angels have made
several citizen’s arrests, but this is
not their main objective.

“We are a calming influence,” said
Martinelli. “People see an Angel and’
they know someone is watching.
They know we’ll get involved.”

Although the Guardian Angels
did encounter resistance from
Mayor Richard Caliguiri when they
began patrolling downtown, the
group collected 42,000 signatures 0
supporting their work. Last Febru-
ary during the arson crisis in South_
Side, a group of concerned citizens

ted in guarding Oakland

asked the Angels to begin patrols
there. Now the Guardian Angels
want to start patrolling Oakland,
but their request has been treated
with mixed enthusiasm. Many ofthe
students at the University of Pitts-
burgh are supporting the Angels,
but university officials are having
their doubts.

According to Director of Public
Safety, William Tucker, “The
Guardian Angels are not needed
here.” Tucker said that he has not
experienced any negative situations
with the Angels but has no intention,
of approving their presence at .Pitt.
“They have to be on campus for a
purpose. I can see no purpose,” said
Tucker. “There is not a crime prob-
lem in Oakland. [The campus
police] do a good enough job.”

But according to Officer Williams
of the Pittsburgh police, the crime in
Oakland is a significant problem.
“Oakland is a commercial area,”

said Williams. “The crime rates are.

the highest in the commercial areas.
Just look at the numbers; they speak
for themselves.” In August alone,
there were four rapes, 25 assaults, 27
robberies, 128‘ thefts, -56 burglaries
and 65 auto thefts in Oakland.
“Another problem in Oakland is
that a lot of the Oakland population

is transitory. Nobody knowsanyone ‘

and nobody helps anyone,” said
Williams. ’

Assistant Director of Public
Safety, Lt. Walt Watters sees the
same problem. “There are a" lot of

outsiders thatxcome to Oakland,”

said Watters, “especially on V the
weekends. We have to remember
that it’s not just students around
here.” '

According to Tucker, the univer-
sity police are primarily concerned
with the students in the immediate
campus area, and he feels that the
crime incidents occuring in Oakland
are not affecting these students.

“Most ofthe calls I get now are for
lo'w-grade thefts,” said Tucker, “and
I think the students trust the univer-
sity police enough to report any
crime.” '

But even if the university police
are covering the campus area suffi-
ciently, many of the 34,000 students
at Pitt are living off campus. What

- about their safety?

Pitt junior Mary Braithewait has
experienced safety problems living
off campus. “I used to walk home
from class about 10 p.m. along Daw-
son and Atwood. These strange guys
would follow me home and yell ob-
scene remarks. I never saw a single
policeman. I’d feel more safe with
the Guardian Angels around. Why
not? It's someone extra’ to help you
out.”

Pitt junior Anita Kinnear has had
the same problem. “I’ve been fol-
lowed to my car twice in Oakland,
and the campus police were nowhere
in sight. I hope the Guardian Angels
do come to Pitt. We need them. I
think students would relate more to
young people than they do to adult
policeman.” '

The students may be willing to
trust the Guardian Angels, but offi-
cials are still wary. They are unfamil-
iar with this organization and

suspicious about their procedures

and effects.

Tucker said, “Why should we
invite [the Guardian Angels] to Pitt?
I don’t know them, and I don’t trust
them.” -

_ Pitt junior M'ark"'Smith has the
same skepticism. “I think -that they

are a group of vigilantes,” said_

Smith. “They try to act like police

officers, and we don’t need them. I’

feel safe with the campus police.”
“A lot of people don’t understand
us. They are-*-going by'media-hyped
images of big black and Hispanic
youth patrolling the streets with
weapons and chains,” said Marti-
nelli, who with his short hair, fair,
freckled skin and oxford shirt, looks
more like the student body president
than the leader of an anti-crime
squad. “What the people at Pitt have
to understand is that we are not
going to come onto campus and
impose something that is not going
to fit their environment.”

continued irom _p¢_rge six_

Not‘ every Oakland official is
against the Guardian Angels.
Officer Richard Borghini of the
Oakland police is willing to give
them a chance.

“I think that they have to prove
themselves,” said Borghini. “If they
can come in and do a goodjob, fine.”

At present the Angels do have
working agreements with the police
of eight different cities, and have
established ﬁve national college
chapters, but until the university
police approve them, according to
Tucker, they will not be able to set
up shop at Pitt.

“Even if I believed there was a
need for an additional security ser-
vice,” said Tucker, “I would start a
student service. I trust students.”

Freshman Kathy Brennan is a stu-
dent at Pitt, and is also a recent

member of the Guardian Angels. ‘

Brennan intends to initiate’a recruit-
ing drive on campus during the next
couple of weeks. .

“I think that there is a need for the
Angels at Pitt,” said Brennan, “but
students need to be educated about
them. I’m just trying to drum up
some support by circulating ﬂyers
and petitions." .

Pitt's Parking Office is now
offering evening campus bus ser-
vice to commuting students who
park their cars in Panther
Hollow.

For a two-week trial period,
the bus will take students to
Panther Hollow between the

hours of7:20 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
The bus, though, will only go to
that parking lot upon request.

If enough students show inter-
est, the service will be continued.

teann  
loses

The name of the game for the
Pitt soccer team is defense, but in
the words of coach . Joe Lux-
bacher, “you have to score to
win.” The Panthers failed to heed
those words and lowered their
record to 5-4-1 by losing to West
Virginia Saturday in Pitt Sta-
dium 1-0.

“It was a pretty even game,”
said Luxbacher, who is just over
.500 in his first year as head
coach. “Neither team had many
chances, and both teams played
good defense. They scored late in
the first half on kind of a contro-
versial score, but it was a score.”

Luxbacher said the team’s
inability to maintain a consistent

‘ scoring attack has been chronic
this season. “We’re not very good
in the offensive parts of the field.
It was a tough loss.”

Wednesday, the team takes on
Robert Morris. Luxbacher says,
the school has a strong soccer .
team with particularly effective
scorers. “As a comparison, we
beat Youngstown 1-0, and they
beat Youngstown 5-l. _ We’re
strong defensively, but we’ll have

“I don’t know if we beat our

country. We can play with anyone in
the country. I believe it. Hopefully,
faith in my teammates and myself

Tennis  
team  
overcomes
W. Liberty

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s tennis team
finally held on to the match that
almost got away on Saturday as they
defeated West Liberty five matches
to four.

By winning their first one-match
contest of the year, the Lady Panth-
ers upped their season record to 9-3

I with one match remaining. The

score was deadlocked at three

matches apiece after the six singles
matches were played, leaving the
best of three in doubles play to
decide the game’s victor. Faced with
this same situation three times ear-
lier in the season, the Lady Panthers
had folded and lost the match.
Against West Liberty,.the team
was determined not to have a repeat
performance of those earlier losses.
“We really wanted to win this one,
especially because it was so close,”
said Jenny Leach, who won in the
No. 3 singles match. Leach and.
Rhonda Gibbs were defeated in their
doubles effort. “It was a really tough
match, but we showed a lot of team
spirit. We all got really psyched up
for this match, because we knew it
would be another IUP-type match,”
' a match the Lady Panthers lost 5-4.
Pitt was able to win the match

despite losses by two of its most con- .

sistent winners this season, Rhonda
Gibbs and Carrie deVera. deVera
was decisiv ly defeated 2-6,. 3-6 in
her singles atch. “I played a good
match," deVera stated. “I thought
we were pretty even; she just! hit
-more winners than Iidid and that
was‘ the difference.” deVera atoned
for that loss later with a critical dou-
bles victory. “We played really well.
In fact, I think it was the best Ste-
phanie [Nelson] and I ever played
together. We are getting more confi-
dent with every match, and if we
keep improving we should be ready
for the Big East.”‘

With her win in the No. 6 singles
match, Nelson was able to assure the
Lady Panthers of at least a tie at the
end of singles play. “I felt really

_ good,” said Nelson, who won 6-4,

7-5. “We were really working
together. It’s been a longtime since
we won a close match."

When eight of the nine matches
had been completed, the teams again
found themselves tied, this time at

. four matches apiece. Pitt lost the

No. 2 doubles matchin three sets
and coupled with the Nelson-deVera

win in the No. 3 match; the entire A

match rested with the success or fail-

ure of Julie Gress and Jodi Levine in _

the No. li, doubles” match. Gress
explained the action: “We won the
first set 6-4, but in the second set we
lost 7-6. The score of the tiebreaker
in that set was 5-7,'so it was as close
as you could get it. Then in the third
set the score was‘4-4. We knew we
had to win, so we just pulled

together and got the next two games .

and won it 6-4.” It was, Gress hardly
needed to add, “the best match Jodi
and I played all year.”

The Lady Panthers meet West

Virginia University, at 3:30 p.m. on
Trees Courts. It is their final regular
season match before headingto the
Big East Championships in’ New
York. . -

 
 
 
  
 
 
  

‘ Carrie deVera lost in singles but won inidoubles.

By Rich McKenzie '
The Pitt News .. '

On Saturday, the University of
Pittsburgh’s cross-country team tra-
veled to Slippery Rock and ‘ran
straight past the Rockets by the
score of 17-40, to raise their record
to‘4—l, as three, of the Panther
runners -registered course records.
Running first for the squad was the
continually improving freshman
Bob Wiener. When asked about
him, Coach Vasvary said, “Bob is
getting stronger and stronger with
every meet.” ‘

Others coming in under the record
were sophomores John Mooney and
John Thomas.. Other Panther
runners who scored were freshmen
Scott Abel and Rodney Giles, who
ran in his first meet after being held
out of the first two’ because of a knee
injury. Coach Vasvary said, “Rod-
ney ran well, considering that he
missed two meets and much practice

   

Runners. topple Rock”

, time because of the injury. We”:
expect high things of Rodney in the 

future.” *

Overall, Coach Vasvary noticed a g 7
great deal of improvement in his_ 
team since the West Virginia meet. - 
He said, “There seemed to be aji
greater amount of overall effort‘- I

Against West Virginia our top ﬁve

runners were 2:20 apart, but against ,  
, Slippery Rock our top seven runners
were only 1:17 apart." Coach Vas- 

vary then went on to say, “We have
to use this to build on and to con-

tinue to get better and better. With -

such a young team it helps to give us
the conﬁdence that we need going
into the tough Big East Champion-'
ships, which are coming up next

Saturday.” “ 

The Slippery Rock squad was pre-
viously undefeated and according to
Coach Vasvary, “area mainstay at
the top of their section, nearly every
year.” This victory hopefully will
give the Panthers momentum which
will help them in the Big East Cham-
pionships, where there will be a high

number of quality teams with high- j  

caliber runners.

Louise O’Shaughnessy were two Pitt
players selected to the all-
tournament team.

“Sue is developing into a national-
caliber middle blocker,” Collier
commented. “We relied a lot on her,
and she played extremely well.”
Hoover was second for Pitt in kills
with 48, including 23 in the Duke
match alone, and that was tops in
the match.

“I’m very, very happy that we won
this tournament,” Hoover gushed.
“I'm glad we came, because it
improved the team. After losing
three matches last weekend, it felt
really good to win. I was really ner-
vous at the beginning of each game,

and when I had to play for Ulana, it
made me extra nervous."

Kohutiak, a regular on all-
tournament teams and often the
MVP, was selected as the tourna-
ment MVP again despite being
forced to sit out the last of the four
matches with a back injury suffered
in the third match (LSU).

“We compensated for Ulana's

vabsense emotionally,” Hoover said.

“We put our minds to it and did it.”

0’Shaughnessy is Pitt’s first fresh-
men selection to an all-tournament
team this season. “It pleases me a
great deal,” said Collier. “Especially
in view of her being a freshman. She
has been showing improvement, and
this is her reward.” .

“Our whole team could’ve been
selected,” said O’Shaughnessy.
“We're really coming together as a

team. We had to play a lot harder '

when Ulana got hurt. This win [tour-
nament] puts‘ us on the right track,
where we should be.”

According to Collier, it was “basi-
cally” up to freshman Krista Zeiner
to replace the veteran Kohutiak.

“Not having all the seniors didn’t A

really affect me,” Zeiner remarked.
“It was great to know I could go in
and play strong when the team
needed me. I knew I had to do it; I
went in thinking about [my role] and
working with the team.”

Dante Wiley (18) holds on for the interception but the Panthers lost their fifth game anyway.

“Two guys made big, big plays to
keep us out of it."

Hold almost put Pitt back in when
his fumble on a keeper to open the
second half — the first of USC’s ﬁve,
lnishandlings that half — was recov-
ered by linebacker Troy Benson.
The Panthers returned the favor two
plays later when tackle Glenn
Woodley stuck his paw between
Jelic and tailback Charles Gladman.

“I felt like we had a chance to
score [then] and move the ball well,”
Jelic said. “No way are you going to
hold on to the ball when a guy had
his hands on it.”

“Seemed to me when we got the
breaks we gave it right back,” Fazio
added. “When they got the breaks,
they stayed with the breaks.”

From there the Panthers broke
down. It only took a little over two

'minutes after Woodley’s recovery

for Hold to drill Wade with a 33-
yard touchdown pass down the right

“We tackled very, very poorly,”
Fazio assured everyone. “We were
trying to force more turnovers, we
wanted to win so badly. We wanted
to get the ball, but we didn’t wait, we
didn’t give ourselves time.”

It hasn’t been something confined

to Saturday, either. Like a mosquito 5

bite that won't heal, explaining Pitt’s

self-defeating tendencies makes‘

players and coaches bristle.

“Seems like we‘re always‘ asked
that question,” J elic said. “You have

to keep your head ‘up, you -can't _

change your character."

Both. USC and The Wave did a
good job of drowning out Pitt Satur-
day afternoon on a’ nice, sunny day.

completed only one of six for seven
yards. Scales finished the day with
I25 yards after four catches, by far
his best day as a ﬂanker.

On the running ledger, Heyward
led Pitt with 58 yards on 14 carries
and scored Pitt's first fourth-quarter
touchdown this year. Gladman was
close behind with 55 yards. Jelic was
getting 50 yards aypzunt after three
kicks in the first half, but slumped to
a 43-yard average overall after hit-
ting eight punts.

As is his custom, Benson led all
tacklers with 20 while end Steve
Apke checked in with a next-best I4.
Pitt recorded ﬁve sacks, with middle
guards Dennis Atiyeh and Walter
Johnson each in on two.

Doleman wore No. 36 for a while
in the first half; while ‘getting his
usual No. 56 stitched together after
it was torn.

Tackle Lorenzo Freeman suffered
a sprained ankle early in the second

quarter and watched the second half a

on crutches in street clothes. Defen-
sive end Chuck Williams popped his
left knee, but he’s expected to be
ready for Miami thisweek. End Bill
Sapio suffered a sprained knee in the
game. _ ~ ‘

“They have probably one of the.
most complex offenses in the
nation,” said Collier. “It’s Olympic
style. Ulana was easily the dominant
player and turned in one of the best
performances of any player ever at
Pitt.” Kohutiak tallied a school
record of 33 kills for a single match.
With Hoover’s 14 kills, the pair
recorded a total of 47 kills — one
more than LSU’s entire team. A

“We decided not to utilize senior
Pat Belcher because she experienced
some knee problems, so we had to
use two freshmen,” Collier said.
“The first game we played extremely
well. The second was highly con-
tested, and in the third we showed a

lot of maturity as a team. The bad

news is that Ulana sustained a back
injury in the fourth game.”

“It's a muscle spasm,” explained
Kohutiak. “I am treating it very deli-
cately so I don’t reinjure it.”She was
not sure whether she would be prac-
ticing today or not.

In yesterday morning's victory
over Duke, Pitt was forced to play

. without Kohutiak and Belcher was

reinserted, along with freshman
Krista Zeiner. “The team was con-
cerned about how to _play without
their best player,” Collier said. “Pat
played ‘with a great deal of pain but
responded, well to the situation."

; ‘In addition, Collier noted the

invaluable play of sophomore Kris
Wexell and junior Sally Gillespie

“A lot of credit-should go to. Sally

and Kris, who werevthe two shortest
starters [5-5 and ‘5-4] of any team

‘there. Their- defense, ser_ving’and

emotional intensity were keys to our

winning. They" were really good

under pressure. . '
“This was a major volleyball tour-

‘nament in" the national volleyball

scope, and a big one for us,” Collier
said. _ * ' *

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Forget the
tales coming from Detroit, Seattle
or anywhere in between about this

5 human phenomenon called The
Wave. Stadium partisans there

 claim, falsely at that, to perform the
' finest renditions of synchronized ris-

. ing from and settling back in their
" seats section by section. ‘
Somehow Williams-Brice Sta-

- dium here was lost in the shufﬂing of

feet and the waving. of arms. Foot-
, ball fans in these parts are so attuned

 

to making The Wave work, you'd
think exhaustive rehearsals were
behind it. It's serious work, because

much more goes into making The -

Wave complement the on-field
‘exploits of their most-watched foot-
ball team, South Carolina.
Crammed into the 50-year-old
structure, 73,100 of the faithful
taunted, razzed, tormented, ridi-
culed and sneered at the Panthers all
afternoon Saturday as Pitt dropped
to 1-5 with a.45-21 loss to the Game-
cocks, who now stand 5-O. ‘
Don’t expect any of the Pitt
coaches or players to lay blame on a
crowd that remained continually

 

 sports Mg  

boisterous for over three hours. But

something was terribly wrong in the ..

first half, an inequity that needed
explaining. The Pitt defense wasn't
making the critical tackles. Hint of
that showed. on USC’s firstplay
from scrimmage when end Chris
Doleman let quarterback Allen Mit-
chell slip through his grasp on a pass
play. _

That series ended in a punt. Oth-
ers proved more injurious. In USC’s
fifth drive alone, at least five Pan-
thers. swarmed around Mitchell in
the pocket before his nine-yard
‘pickup. Later the junior picked up
another first down with a 13-yard

 

scamper that saw him spin off
defenders like a pinball off bumpers.
Two plays later back Tom Dendy
scored his first of two touchdowns
36 seconds into the second quarter.
Two series later the Panthers
recorded two critical sacks before
Mitche1l’s alternate," Mike Hold,
actually ran on one hand and his feet
for 12 yards through the middle.
Two plays later Doleman and mid-
dle guard Walter Johnson had Hold
running for dear life near the Pitt 45
before he unleashed a 31-yard
touchdown strike to Chris Wade, his

A first of two touchdown catches. The

dary, Dante Wiley, was 10 yards
distant.

“I could see there was the quarter-
back scrambling and a couple of de-
fensive backs were coming up to the
line of scrimmage. We .were in the
right coverage, but came up too
soon,” said Wiley, who started his
first game at free safety. ,

For its part, Pitt not onlyhad to
surmount an early 14-0 deficit, but
do so without quarterback John
Congemi, who suffered a concussion
when linebacker Carl Hill blind-
sided him late in the first quarter.

Spikers win invitational down
South, Kohutiak MVP despite injury

By Laurie Kubli
The pm News

The Pitt women’s volleyball team

raised its record to 16-4 over the-

weekend, but mere numbers fail to
-measure the full impact of the spik-
ers’ winning of Louisiana State Uni-
versity’s invitational yesterday.
“This was one of the most mean-
ingful tournaments I have won in
five years at Pitt," stated head coach
Shelton Collier.
The team defeated Rice, Missis-

sippi State, LSU and Duke to win ‘

the three-day tournament held in
"New Orleans. Senior Ulana Kohu-
tiak was the tournament MVP de-
spite missing the fourth and final
match due to an injury suffered in

to South Carolina.

' Caged Panther

Dennis Atiyeh seemed to sulk like “a
cagedanimal” following Saturday’s loss

   

the third match, and Cathy Rupp,
sophomore Sue Hoover and fresh-
man Louise O’Shaughnes_sy were
selected to the all-tournament team.

“Everybody’s_ beaming down
here,” Kohutiak said during the
team's stopover in Atlanta. “We're
just radiating, really proud.” Kohu-
tiak led the tournament in kills with
57 — in just three matches —— which-
Collier said is extremely significant.

Rupp led the tournament in two
categories, assists with 115 and ser-
vice aces with 27, both of which Col-
lier said were “far ahead of anybody
else.” Sophomore Kris Wexell was
second for Pitt with 14 service aces,
and Sally Gillespie was among the
leaders with 38 digs.

Pitt’s first opponent was Rice on
Friday, who Pitt defeated 15-5, 15-
12, 15-2. Rupp scored 13 service aces.

Pitt defeated host LSU i-n the '0

cable-televised, Saturday night
match in what Collier said was “the
most exciting match of our season,
definitely one of the most exciting in
my five years at Pitt.” Pitt won,l5-
10, 13-15, 16-14, 15-6. The LSU
team has one starter under_6-0, while

the average Pitt playeriis‘ 5-7. “We '
lost 5 or 6 inches at every position,” ‘

Young spikers shine

‘By Laurle_Kub1l

And they all fall  up?
According to nursery rhymes, .
Sir Isaac Newton and many oth-
ers, people fall down; but when
its seniors began to disappear,
Pitt’s women’s volleyball team
turned to the freshmen and
sophomores, righted itself and
won Louisiana ,State’s
invitational.

There is no joy in Oakland, but
last night in New Orleans there
was an overabundance of it. In
one of the biggest" weekends in
the program’s history. ‘Pitt
defeated four established teams‘

from the South and Southwest:
Rice, Mississippi, LSU and
Duke. _

,“We have the smallest number
of players on our roster of any
team at the tournament," said
head coach Shelton Collier. “We
have the shortest team, and we
had several top players’ out -
Judy Young, Ulana Kohutiak
and Pat Belcher — and we still
found a way to win.”

The entire team played
extremely well, according to C01-
lier but the results would have
been very different without‘ sev-
eral of the younger athletes’
exceptional level of play. Sopho-
