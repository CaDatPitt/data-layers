Bulletin

The University opens this morning with an enrollment far in excess of any preceding year; the various de-

partmemts have been enl-argened and strengthened materially.

Along with this gratifying news the announcement is made with pleasure that the time honored monthly
publication, The Ciourant, has been superseded by an up. to.date weekly newspaper, which will be known as THE

PITT WEEKLY.

Courant, who deem the move in keeping with the greater ‘University.

It is the intention to publish a four page paper, the pages being the same size as this -one, and to make the
weekly the real representative of the student ‘body. Every department will be taken care of with the greatest
pains; athletics will be written up from the students standpoint; the editorials will always be free from prejudice
-and endeavor to clearly interpret the wish of the students of the University. In :a word the weekly is going to be

the student’s paper, in which every one has a common interest. L

Beginning Wednesday October the ﬁfth THE PITT WEEKLY will be issued every Wednesday during the
school year. The price of the paper will be ﬁve cents percopy, one dollar and ﬁfty cents for the year.

The board solicits the kindly interest of students and faculty alike until the ﬁrst regular number of the
weekly comes out one week from Wednesday. The initial number will contain all the features of the year, includ-

ing a full account of the lrst football game.

FOOT BALL, IS ‘HERE

Saturday of this week the {football
seas-on opens with Ohio Northern as
our opponents and from pres-ent ex-
pectations the game will arouse a
great deal -of interest, not alone-from
the fact that it is the ﬁrst game of
the season, but because of ‘the initial
demonstration of the new playing
rules in this city. Coacih Thompson
tells us that we have something
pretty good ‘this fall and as a general
rule his word is worth some consid-
eration. T-he -m-en have been out for
several days prior to the opening of
college and all indications point to a
fairly good start for the season’s
campaign. At this «date it is impos-
sible to give a comrplelte list of all the
candidates, but, it is ‘hoped to be able
to present all the names in the regu-
lar issue next Wednesday;

The opening of ‘the season means
that all students should be on the
lines on Saturday afternoon and do
but one thing, ***** JROOT. The
time to -start the Pitt spirit is NOW’,
not ne-ar the W. an-d J. game, but, at
the very beginning of things, which
means at the game Saturday.

BUILDING NOT READY

Owing ‘to .a slight delay in the work
on the -Medical building the regular

ses-sion‘s -of the school of medicine

will not be held in the new structure
on the hill as originally planned. For
a :few weeks the clas=ses will be con-
ducted in the old building on Brere-
ton Avenue. It is hoped the medical
student-s will get in their "new home
as soon as possible.

LARGE ENROLLMENT   I

_-—¢

The enrollment is larger this term‘,

than any time in ‘the history of the
University; a large number of the
students coming from many different
parts of the country as w-ell as the
immediate vicinity. The school of
engineering is, of course, receiving
many men who are interested in the
cooperative plan, w=hile the school of
economics is attracting a great many
to its numbers; the new school of
eduvca-‘ti-on is assured of «a ‘healthy
growth from the start; the school of
mines is drawing its usual number of
devotees; the college is -making
strides far in excess of the past when
its numbers were comparatively
small.

NEW DEANS

The new students -as well as the
old ones will ﬁnd the new deans in
chalrsge today for the ﬁrst time since
-their election last year. The deans
and their schools are as follows:
Holdsworth, Economics; Fetterman,
College; Chambers, 'Educa-tion. VVad*s-
worth, Mines; IBishop, "Engineering.

TO FRESHMEN

,-Freshmen will tﬁnd it to ‘their ad-
vantage to learn the -football yells as
soon as-*possi-bl-e, as we are going to
use :them at the game -on Saturday
afternoon. The Weekly will 'prinL
the complete yells and song-s as devisi-
ed last year in the next issue. -Bo
sure to get the paper next week ant‘.
every week after.

FACULTY CHANGES

A ‘few slight changes have been
made in the faculty since last year;
a complete list of the new men will
be given in the regular issue next
week.

 

BOARDING HOUSES

New students will ﬁnd a list -of
suitable boarding houses posted -on
the bulletin boards which it will -be
proﬁ=table to look over. It would -‘be
well -to enlist rt-he services of an old
student when a room is desired as
the latter is more familiar wit-h con-
ditions in the -city.

 

O'“'F|C|Al_ NOTICES

The board has received assurance
from the faculty -that all notices per-
taining to lectures, examinations,
etc., will be given for publication in
this paper. A spe-cial invitation is
extended the professors to use these
-columns for that purpose. This is an
innovation, which will surely meet
with the approval 0-f instructors and
s-tudents alike because bulletin board
information is not always reliable.

 

NAMES CHANGED
—-1:-rd
It is no longer polite to say the
Engineering or Mines building, but,
the proper caper is now, Thaw Hall
and State Hal-1. The -change in name
is -much more digniﬁed and is a ﬁt-

BOOK STORE MOVED

Students will ﬁnd the -book st-ore
moved from its former location in
Thaw Hall to -the basement of the
same building. Owing to the great
demand :for rooms it -was found im-
perative to assign the book store less
com.modi~ou=s quarters. Professor
Bankson admits that :he is -cornered
as far location is -concerned but in
respect -to business he is still at the
“same old stand. The new men will
flnsd a cordial welcome at the book
store.

STUDENT NOTICES

The various student -oﬂicers, su-ch

officers and -the like are earnestly in-
vited to send all the notices for meet-
ings, etc., to the Weekly. tAabsolute-
ly no charge will be made for print-
ing all notices—bring them around
that’s all.

HOUR CHANGED

‘The ﬁrst -hour this ‘term begins at
eight-thirty instead of eight o’olock
as was the custom last year. Many
mo-re Saturday classes ar-e -also sched-
uled than for-merly. We defer men-
tioning another ven-tu-re, which ef-
fects the inner man. ‘
