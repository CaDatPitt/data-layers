Actress Dislappgoints Crowd 

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

Greta Thyssen left ’em crying
Thursday in what must be the
biggest’ disappointment at the
University since Sacco-.-Van-
zetti.

Miss Thyssen, currently star-
ring at the Nixon in the comedy
“In One Bed,
Other)," failed to appear as
scheduled before the University
Community that afternoon in
the SU Ballroom. The former

. Miss Denmark had promised to

pose for photographers in any
costume -— including a bikini.
Consequently one of the larg-

(and Out the ‘

Schweiger, a Pitt News col-
umnist, had his hands full
controlling the restless audi-
ence, Schweiger did every-
thing but handstands as he
manned the microphone for
better than one and one-half A
hours. Johnny Carson’s ten-
ure at NBC may be threaten-
ed if Schweiger ~ decides to
make emceeing his career.
His composure wasﬁrm and
his stage, presence, if not
commanding, was impressive.
The upcoming Honors Con-
yocation is thus secure. Could
C. P. Snow have hoped to fol-
low the ample Miss Thyssen?

est crowds seen this year
(mostly male) gathered in the
ballroom to await the appear-
ance of the buxom actress. Wait
they did, some for over two
hours.
Scheduling Problems

It was later revealed that the
director of the Nixon comedy,
not informed of the‘ scheduled
appearance here of his star, de-
cided to revise his first act the
same afternoon. At the news,
the: students howled in a man-
ner that no tuition raise could
provoke.

For Engineers W eek
‘ ' ' By PATRICK POLLING I ’

It's enevitable that St. Patrick will arrive at noon, in front of

the Student Union’ next.Monday. He does every year. The only
question is, “How will he arrive?"

Attired in traditional Irish garb, St. Patrick, in the person of
an engineering student, will headline a, parade slated to usher in
this year's Engineers’ Week. There's talk that the Irishman may
abandon last year’s. souped-up auto entrance and instead fly in on
a shillelagh. However, David Poscich, chairman of the Engineers;
Week steering committee, refused to conﬁrm the idea.

“Each year St. Patrick chooses a unique approach,” explained
Poscich. “This year will‘ be no exception. However, I can’t really
say what it will be.”

Originate at Hall

The parade, said Poscich, will originate at Engineering Hall,
come down the hill past the Syria Mosque and culminate in front
of the Student Union. He noted that it will include “semi-ﬂoats,”
a number of placard-toting engineers’ and engineering students in

the University Marching Band.

Theme for the week, “Engineering the Future,"’ will be

evident both in the parade and in the displays to be viewed at
Engineering Hall that same day. "

Mellon Lecture Begins
Tribute to Avon Bard  ,

By NANCY FUCHS
The University is taking part in the world—wide celebra-
tion of the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s birth

by offering a series of free programs commemorating the» *

“Bard of Avon” this week. Tonight Dr. Frederick W. Stern-
feld, visiting Mellon Professor of Music, will discuss “Shake-
speare’s Songs and Their Sources,” in the Graduate School
of Public Health Auditorium at 8:15 p.m. ‘

‘Last month, Shakespeare expert Dr. Allardyce Nicoll
gave a series of three Andrew Mellon lectures on “Shake-n

speare, the Elizabethans, and Ourselves.”

Shakespearean actor Morris Carnovsky will be Mid-
day guest at noon Wednesday in the Student Union Ball-

Set Today c
On CF. Show

Today’s Student Union Forum
Series at 3 p.m. In the SU Sup-
per Room will feature a debate on
the merits of Thursday’s Convo-
cation speaker, C. P. Snow. The
title of‘ the program is “Quotes
and Comments.” f

Snow is considered'one of the
most controversial men in liter-
ature today. His concern with the
distinction between the scientiﬁc
and humanistic approach to life
has earned .him the undying‘ re-
spect of some critics and the vehe-
ment disgust of others. ' ’

The debate will center about
_Dr. Joseph Lipson of the Physics
Dept., an avid follower of Snow,
and Dr. Richard Tobias of the
English Dept., a critic of Snow.
The rest of the panel will be an-
nounced at the program. ’ -

‘The significance of Snow’s most
widely read book, Two Cultures,
will be debated. The ﬂoor will be
opened for audience participa-
tion. ’

Actor Speaks
At Midday i

Morris Carnovsky, a Shake-
spearean actor, will be featured
by the Midday Series noon Wed-
nesday in the Student Union Ball-
room. During his talk, which is
part of the special Shakespeare
Week programs, he will present
readings and give criticisms.

Having made his acting debut
with the Henry. Jewitt Players in
Boston, Carnovsky made his ﬁrst
New York appearance with the
Provincetown Players in God of
Vengeance in 1922.

Period Cross-Section ‘

The aim, according to Glori-_i 
anne Engle, program director, is .

to “present a cross-section of
the entire Elizabethan period as
viewed by the people who lived
in it.” ,
Commenting on the plan of,
action,“ Miss Engle noted that
“all readings will proceed with- _;
out’ introduction -or comment. f
All scenes will be played, but
the actors will neither look at
nor react to one another. All
their acting will be directed‘
toward the audience proper as
is usually the case ‘m dramatic

The subject matter of the pub-
lic documents, private journals,
letters, and sermons which will
be read includes different kinds

ment, supernatural visions, king-
ship, villainy, and death. '

Losers Doused

“The Gimmick’s” rules reward losers with a thorough douse
from a water hose, while awardingthe winner points toward the
week’s total, which will determine the recipient of the Shamrock
Award. 0 A 0

“The Shamrock Award,” explained Poscich, “is an annual

total points at the week’s end after all activities have been
judged." _ i '.

According to Poscich, the Shamrock Award -- a plaque — be-
comes the possession of the winning department at the Shamrock

Ball, _a semi-formal closing out the week. The award is then held I

by that department until next year’.s Engineers’ Week competition.

T Chemical Engineering has copped the award the past two years.

Ball at Penn Sheraton
The Shamrock Ball will be held at 8 p.m. March 20 at the

"Penn Sheraton Hotel, music to be provided by the Baron Elliott

“Tickets can be bought at the door at $3.50 per couple.”

As a preface to the week’s activities, the committee has sched-
uled a mixer dance at 8 p.m. Friday in the SU Ballroom. Tickets
will be available at the door at a cost of 50 cents. The Playboys
will be featured entertainment. ‘

Events in Judging

Events to be judged for the Shamrock Award by a special

‘Shamrock Ball attendance, parade arrival, seminar, mixer dance

attendance, freshman and sophomore participation at both dances,
“The Gimmick,” and St. Patricia contest. They have- been sealed in

order of importance.

“All engineering classes will be cancelled from noon Mon-
day to noon Wednesday,” said Poscich. “with the exception of
freshman and‘ sophomore classes Wednesday morning.”

Two representatives from each department in the School of

Increase    

The University has announced

vania teachers from the tuition

 

_:*$~—#-1

r

that it will exempt all Pennsyl;’

increase which becomes effective _

in September.

This means that any public,
private, or parochial school teach-
er in the state will receive a tui-
tion scholarship of $8 per credit
on any graduate course which will
contribute to his ability as an edu-
cator. 0

Starting in September, in-ser-
vice teachers will thus pay lower
tuition than other University stu-
dents. Tuition for these teachers
would ordinarily have risen to $47
per -credit.

Included in the category “in-
service teachers” will be such staff
members as principals, guidance
counselors, and a few education
employees studying as under grad-
uates. College faculty members
studying for advanced degrees in
the School otfEducation will also
be eligible forthe lower ‘rate.

School of Education Dean
Paul H. Masoner said, “The de-
cision reflects the special obli-
gation _which the University as
an educational institution quite
naturally feels toward the
schools.” -

Dean Masoner said it was hoped
the tuition scholarships would en-

courage more teachers to continue .

their education.

An estimated 2,000 teachers take
graduate courses in the various
University divisions each year.

«Convocation Diseussedi”atSG Meeting ‘

r

By VIJAY JAIN

Despite lack of a quorum, Stu-
dent Government held discussions
on parking, Honors Convocation
and the health service. No re-
solutions could, however, be in-

. troduced or passed.

A spokesman for parking com-
mittee disclosed that Charles Ray,
Captain
proposes to close the entire quad-
rangle on weekends to alleviate
the bottleneck of traﬁic caused
when students come to pick up
and drop oil‘ their dates.

Ray proposed ‘to close the quad
between 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. and
1-1:30 a.m. on Friday and Satur-
day, on a_trial basis for the week-
end of March 20, the day of the
Shamrock Ball.

Under the system approxi-
mately 50 spaces will be made
available to students in the un-
derground parking lot beneath
the quad with entrance from
the Towers. Students wishing
the space will have to ﬁll out a
reservation form. The driver
will be then issued a ticket for

. parking‘ for the time it takes to

pick up and drop off the women.
Tickets will be issued on a first
come first serve basis. '

The senators present were op-
posed to the scheme and a com-
mittee was instructed to oppose
the move.” I have a feeling that
Capt. Ray will try it out with or
without our approval and sup-
port,” the committee chairman an-'
nounced, “however I will see him

«tomorrow ‘and try to gain time

0‘ till we can make a counter pro-

posal.”

Objections to the proposal were
about the red tape and inconveni-
ence that will be caused. Emily
Klieman pointed out that Capt.

Ray had said the same thing about ~

closing the inner quad but the
students didn’t have any say when
it was closed off permanently.

Counter suggestions made
were: to have inner quad open-
ed on weekends, approach city
to limit parking, on Fifth Ave-
nue and ‘Forbes to 15 minutes
"so these spaces will be avail-
able, and approach neighboring
parking lots to ‘ provide short.
time parking free of charge.
None of the proposals, however,
were thought to be feasible.

The health service ,committee
is conducting a random survey in
the dorms to evaluate the health

service. The report is expected in "

three weeks. Susan Druckmiller re-

/

quested that all students who have
questionnaires should fill them out
honestly and turn them in-at the
earliest opportunity. '

Scholars Banquet will be held
Thursday at 6:30 in the Faculty

speaker, was to deliver a speech
but he may not be able to attend.

Editorial: A lousy

afternoon. She never showed up.‘

C. P. Snow, a distinguished author and educator, has likewise
accepted an" invitation from the University to display his considerably
more literate wares at the Spring Honors Convocation this Thursday.

He will show up.

~ There will most probably be a slight contrast between the two
receptions. Itis very doubtful whether the Syria Mosque will be packed
with panting students desiring to catch a glimpse of the famous Mister
Snow. Rather, the gallery will be ﬁlled — speckled is a more apt phrase
-- with faculty members and a scattering, of the curious -— the students.
Outside of the fact that C. P. Snow would probably make a very unap-

The SC-uessing C-ame

Making political predictions is a
hazardous profession. It led to
the demise of the Literary Digest

‘in 1936 when they predicted a

smashing victory for Landon over

less, it’s a fas-
cinating g a m e
and like cigar-

With full reali- ' .

»zation of the hazards involved,‘ 

would like to embark on the
perilous journey of predicting the
outcome of the Republican con-
test for the presidential nomina-
tion, by way of a look at the con-
tenders.

Senator Barry Goldwater, the
best bet in September, is running
poorly in, March. As soon as he
took the cast off his ankle, all he
succeeded in doing was putting
his other foot in his mouth. His
exposure in New Hampshire has
uncovered two glaring weaknesses.
First, he has found it diﬂicult to
get out with the people and do
some old fashioned handshaking

‘ r and baby-kissing. This is a great
surprise, because Goldwater is re--
garded as no slouch with regard'

to his personal charm.

Secondly, his position on pub-
lic questioning. New Hampshire
senior citizens are hostile to his
views on social security, and
the voters are skeptical as to the
depth of his analysis on foriegn
affairs. This comes as no sur-
prise to Goldwater's detractors.

Governor Nelson Rockefeller,
’the worst bet in December, has
made phenominal gains. However
dimly New Hampshire voter view

his liberal posture, they cannot
resist his personal magnetism. He
strikes up an immediate rapport
with the public and in spite of his
unbelievable wealth the -voters
seem. to identify with him. ‘Sec-
ondly, he has taken issue with
Goldwater on ‘specific issues and
has convinced many-people that
he has the intellectual ability and
unﬂinching determination to run
the U.S. as well as anybody else
can. His image is not unlike the
late President Kennedy’s. 
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge
is somewhat .of an anamoly. He
has made no effort to push him-
self, but is a strong contender in
the New Hampshire primary. His
experience as a senator and am-

bassador has left the image of a.
dedicated public servant, admired '

by Republican and Democrat alike.
Voters know what he can do and
have extreme confidence in him. A
Governor William Scranton is‘
the hardest running non-candi-
date the public has seen in a
long time. He has_ powerful
backing not only from the busi-
ness community, but more im-
portantly from the nation’s big-
gest publishers. It .is no mere
coincidence that in the past two
months Newsweek, Look, Life,
Saturday Evening Post, Fortune,
and Business _Week have given
the nation a highly favorable
look at William Scranton. And ‘
isn’t it strange that a Governor
of Pennsylvania is giving an in-
creasing number of public
speeches on U.S. foreign policy?
Governor Scranton is the only
person who believes he is not
seeking the nomination, and then
he’s suffering from a self-delusion.
Governor Romney is not trusted
by the Republican party, Harold
Stassen is a misguided soul who
hasn’t yet realized he no longer
is Minnesota’s thirty-one year old

The hot news that Greta Thyssen, a Danish bombshell with a tri-

It's Not What You Are . .

    It's WhaiYou Have‘

The other day I went ‘to one of the local
stores to buy a gift for a friend. After I had
selected something I liked, I asked the salesgirl

. to remove the price tag and manufacturer’s guar-

antee. The request seemed ,
reasonable enough, but the
salesgirl was puzzled by this
strange demand and advised
me to leave the manufacturer’s
propaganda intact so as to im-

« press the recipient with the
monetary value of my present.
The attitude of the salesgirl
merely reflects the increasing
trend to equate "friendship with
money. .

Needless to say, this turn of .
events is rather unfortunate. The almighty dol-
lar which has taken over in other sanctiﬁed insti-

.tutions seems to have added another triumph to
its list of victims. I will be the last .to state that
wealth is bad, but I do believe that increasingly,
more and more emphasis is being placed on false
‘values. It is an evil institution to measure every-
thing in terms of ﬁnancial beneﬁts-— especially
friendship. -
People now do not look for qualities or com-
patibility in their friends but rather seek as
‘ their friends those having power or position so
‘ that the friendship may prove to be of some
material value to them both in school and later
in life. -

Such political friendships are becoming so
prevalent that one does not know whether the
friend is genuinely interested in the person or
has an insincere motive. There have been in-
stances, for example, where students have become
friends of certain student leaders so that they

might get into an honorary, and having failed at

their objective have called these ‘student leaders
insincere friends for not helping them with their
selﬁsh desires. Again, Greeks often make friends
with freshmen, but if the friendliness doesn’t
continue when they do not join the group or
are passed over by the fraternity or sorority,
they feel misled and terminate their relationship.

A coed was quite frank tome about what she
expected out of our friendship. She said that her
time was valuable and if I expected to have her
company I could pay for it — the pay—oﬁ being
in the form of expensive dinners and opera dates.
I admired her for her frankness, and soon the
relationship petered out when she felt that I did
not put the proper amount of value on her time.

The. attitude about ﬁnding “the right kind of
date” is quite prevalent on the part of coeds,

though I do know of coeds who do go about
with students who are not wealthy and thor-
oughly enjoy their date.

The desire to ﬁnd a ‘suitable mate is natural
enough but I feel too much emphasisis placed on
present and future economic status of the person.
This is true not only of the female but also of
the male students.

There is nothing wrong with helping out a ,

friend but such help should come unsolicited and
unexpected. A true friend must have faith in
the good intentions of a friend, and as such his
position should never be compromised to achieve
a selﬁsh objective.

As matters rest now one can never be sure if
friends are honest and if whatever one does will
not go unappreciated. There have been instances
where one’s best intentions are misinterpreted
and have fostered misunderstandings. A re-eval-
uation of the institution of friendship may still
be in time to reverse a very unhealthy trend that-
threatens tostiﬂe it. - '

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

‘That master showman, Ed
Sullivan, better known as Ed
Solomon, has ﬁnally choked
in his own endeavors as tele-
visions number one impre-
sario. He introduced {the
Beatles to the nation via the air-
waves two weeks ago and the

furor created by these barber’s.

delights drew more attention than
the combined parades for Lind-
bergh, MacArthur, and Glenn.
That was ﬁne and dandy as far
as Mr. Solomon was concerned.
He then made the fateful error
of transporting_ the Beatle pack
to Miami Beach and booking a
young lady named Mitzi Gaynor

to follow the group on last Sun-

day’s program-
The after-effects of Miss Gay-
nor’s “bit” still haven’t worn off.

-I asked about twenty people if
they had "seen the Bntles and

their responses were “Boy, wasn’t -
Before I attempt»

she terri_ﬁc!’_’
to analyze ' Miss Gaynor’s ‘per,-
formance I think a few remarks
about the Bottles, er, Beatles,
would be pertinent.

If the Beatles showed up with
haircuts one of these days they
will have as much popularity
as Yul Brynner doing a Vitalis
commercial. They have some
talent but there are many bet-
ter singing groups and more
gimmicky performers. Some of
the tunes they have recorded
are wild and unhibited to the
point that they seem to grow

on the listener. "After each lis- S ’

tening the songs and the beat
seem to jump up on you and
grab. It is an ingratiating ef-
fect to say the least. .I would,
however, have "to ‘group them
with the same sort of frenzy
and madness of which curiosity
pieces or new fads are made.
I doubt if they will survive the
summer as recording idols. (I

said the same thing about Elvis, .

Rick, Frankie, and Fabe and
wasn’t too far off base in my
predictions.)

Now comes Mr. E’d’s booking
bun-gle. He probably thought that
everything after the Beatles would
be ﬁll-ins for time until the group
made their return appearance. So

I just sat back, opened a bottle
of diet-rite, and watched the
“other performers.” When Mitzi
Gaynor came onstage, suntanned,
dressed in a low-cut white, cock-
tail gown,I spilled my glass of
diet-rite. Then she sang, danced,
and, cavorted and tore down’ the
Deauville Hotel. She had four
companions to assist in the songs
and dances but that would be like

teammates on the Warriors. She

, sang and danced to “Too Darn
A Hot,”

and my temperature in-
creased by three hundred degrees.
Then she came back _ later and

saying Wilt Chamberlain has four,

sang “The More I See You,” one
of my favorite numbers. As a
ﬁnale Mitzi and the group went
through some rockin’ tunes like
“When the Saints Go Marching
In,’l’ andthat was that.

It had to be one of the most
exciting . and" electrically-charged
moments in the history of tele-
vision and I’m sure that I’m not

alone in my thinking. Miss Gay-V
nor has. always been a lovely,=

talented actress but who thought
of her as a singing and dancing
nitery attraction? It was a dev-
astating performance that left
the Beatles in the Lone Ranger’s
cloud of dust. Mr. Solomon
wasn’t the wise showman this
time out and he has probably
-been oncthe phone all day apol-
ogizing to the Beatles’ caretakers
and fans.

Last Saturday’s win over
Penn State gave the Pan-
ther wrestling team' the
mythical dual meet champ-
ionship of the East and thus
establishes them as the fa-

vorite in the Eastern champion-
ships this weekend at Franklin
and Marshall College in Lan-
caster, Pa.

Although having the best dual

meet team does not necessarily '

indicate the best tournament
team the Panthers earned their
favorite role because competi-
tion in the East has been so
close this season and their dual
meet supremacy was the de-
termining factor.

Army was the only Eastern
team to defeat the Panthers.

'rrciisrEws‘i-’1i1onagiy;‘~Ma_m;h 9, 1964

Strangely enough, this was
Army’s only win over another
Eastern - school. The Panthers
had a 4-1 record in the East with
wins over Syracuse, Cornell, Le-

high and Penn State.

The two biggest factors in the
Panthers copping the dual meet
crown and ending the season
with a 7-2 mark were Mike

Johnson and Lee Hall. Both
were undefeated with Johnson
winning eight. matches and Hall
nine. Johnson missed the Michi-
gan meet because he was sick.

Johnson, who was unbeaten,
thought tied twice last season,
now has the opportunity to be-
come the third Panther wrestler
to ﬁnish his collegiate career
unbeaten if he can equal this
year’s performance next season.

 

Only Ed Peery and Rich Martin
have been undefeated in their
dual meet careers at Pitt.

Hall improved tremendously
over last year when he turned
in a mediocre 4-4 record and
ranks along with Johnson and
Ken Barr as the Panthers best
hopes of winning individual
titles at Easterns.

Barr posted a 4-2 record dur-
ing the season, but five of his
matches were ineitherlthe 191-
pound class or at heavyweight.
He will enter Easterns at 177-
pounds where he has twice'been
runnerup. Barr was 2-1 at 191-
pounds, 1-1 at hegyyweight and
1-0 at .177—poun'ds during the
season.

After Barr, Hall and Johnson,
Pitt’s best hope for an Eastern
title lies with Frank O’Korn.

 

 

O’Korn ﬁnished the season with
a 5-3-1 record, but this doesn’t
tell a true story. He wrestled
his first four matches of the sea-
son at 147 or 157-pounds and

compiled an 0-3-1 mark. After
he dropped down to 137-pounds
he was unbeaten in his last ﬁve
outings. O’Korn ﬁnished third
in last year’s’ Eastern’s at 137-
pounds. A

O’Korn’sv case is_ somewhat
similar to Tom Baily’s. Baily
wrestled his first four matches
at 167-pounds where he compil-
ed a 2-2 record. Once Rex Peery

got his lineup set, Baily'h.'was:

dropped to 157-pouhdsjwhere he
compiled a 3-1-1 record" to "end

7the season with a 5-3-1 mark.‘

Another position where‘_ the
Panthers made a big improve-

 

men Rate as T opDualMeet Team in East  

ment this season was in the
1'23-pound class. Last year the
team had a 2-2-3 record in this

weight class. This year, how-

ever, Duff Killian was 5-2 at
123-pounds and Tom Heniff 1-1.
Heniff was also 2-1 at 130-
pounds. 9

Hall and Johnson proved the

most valuable members of the-

team by scoring 29 and 28 team
points, respectively.

Bob Snizik:
Matmen Overcame
.Many Obstacles

The performance of the Panther wrestling team this
season is one of the most amazing in the recent history
of Pitt athletics. The Panthers were hit with what ap- ‘
péared to be insurmountable losses at the start of the
season but still came on to be- the top dual meet team in
the East. '

Peeryelost ﬁve‘ regulars before the season started.
Dave Clery, 1,37-pounder, and John
Carr, 157-pounder, failed out; Tim

1 Gay, 167-pounder, and Bill Buch-
anan, heavyweight, were declared
ineligible and Jeff Ware, heavy-
'weight,'who would have started in
place of Buchanan, signed a profes-
sional football- contract. _’

E x p e r t s gave Peery little
chance of coming up with a winn-
ing season, let alone the top team
in the East. But Peery is not an or-

dinary coach and he does not per-

’ A mit his athletes to be ordinary

, BOB SMIZIK either_ ' ‘

The team worked harder than in the past. Frank
O’Korn sacriﬁced and moved down to 137-pounds where

'he is of much more value to the team. Lee Hall dropped

off ten pounds for the Lehigh meet and this was in-
strumental in giving the Panthers a victory in that match.

The team knew that had a -job to do and they did it.

Surprised E ven Peery

’ The results surprised even Peery. Early in the sea-
son, after he had been hit withthe bad news, he said,
“If he hadn’t lost all those boys we’d be right up there
with the best in the.East."' Perhaps Peery was being coy,
but it’s doubtful if even he expected the kind of season
that it turnedout to be.

He really didn’t have the right to expect it. Peery’s
losses would be about equal to the basketball team
losing Cal Sheﬂield and Dave Sauer or the football team
losing Paul Martha, Rick Leeson and Ernie Borghetti.
Those two teams never could have had the kind‘ of.
seasons they did with those losses. But Peery suffered
equally severe losses and still came out best in the East.

Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the team’s suc-
cess was that they did so well even though they gave
up six points before just about every match started.
Peery had to use highly inexperienced_Bil1 Beck in seven
matches this season and Beck just couldn’t be expected
to win against heavier more experienced foes. ‘ I

Had To Use Small Men

In four matches Peery had to use 137-pounder Clair
Riley at 167-pounds and the best‘ Riley could do was one
draw. Once Peery used 137-pounder Don Caslow at
heavyweight and on another occasion he had to use foot-~
ball player Bill Bodle at heavyweight.

There was only one senior on the team — Ken Barr.
The rest of the team was made up of mainly juniors and
sophomores Riley and Dino Boni. Things look even better
for the wrestlers next year, when Peery hopes that Gay
and Buchanan will be off the ineligibility lists.

But right now Peery’s only concern is Eastern Tourna-
ment this weekend. He hasn’t won a title since 1960 and
for Peery that’s bad. He’s used to winning with much
greater frequency. Despite an outstanding season the
Panthers are far from being an overwhelming favorite at
Easterns. But the way Peery and his boys have been

Panthers Play Drake Saturday
InFi1-st Round Game of NIT

Thevﬁrstltrip to the NIT could prove to be a disasterous one for the Panther basket-
ball team. Their opponent is Drake, perhaps the best team in the tournament.

Drake ﬁnished second in the Missouri Valley Conference, considered to be the best"con-
ference in the country. Other teams in the MVC are Wichita, Bradley and Cincinnati. Wichita
defeated Drake in a playoff, 58-50, Friday night to earn the right to go’ to the NCAA. . _

The second place ﬁnisher in the MVC perenially goes to the NIT. This year the

A [second and third place teams are going. Bradley ﬁnished in third
place. Although they ﬁnished in second place in the MVC and were
_among the top ten teams in the country for a while, Drake, was
not one of the seeded teams. ' ’

Bradley, Duquesne, New Mexico and DePaul did get see'd- ‘L

ed. Other teams in the tournament besides Pitt and Drake are
Syracuse, New York University, St. Josephs, Miami of Florida,
Army and St. Bonaventure. \7; 4 . q "

The tournament opens Thursday night, but the Panthers will
not play until Saturday afternoon. Army and St. Bonaventure will
play at 2 p.m. and Pitt and Drake at 4 p.m. The Pitt-Drake game is
scheduled to be televised nationally. ' , ’ f

If the Panthers win on Saturday afternoon, they willfplay New
Mexico‘ Tuesday night. ' I - '

The-"game against Drakewill be the ﬁrst for the Panthers in
two weeks. Coach Bob Timmons has had few practices, prefering to
give his team needed rest. Beginning today, the team will practice
through Thursday. They will leave for,New York Friday. and will
practice in Madison‘ Square Garden-. A

Dave Sauer sat out both practices last week. Sauer strained

-some ligaments in his knee and thought it wiser to rest rather
than aggravate the injury. -He will resume practice today.

‘No other injuries have plagued the Panthers since early in the
year- when Brian Generalovich was at half strengths for'the ﬁrst
few. games and Paul Krieger was forced to sit" out the Dartmouth
game. ' V H

Although losing their ﬁnal game of the season to Penn State,
78-63, the—Panthers did win 13 of their last 16 games.

Had the Panthers- won against State, it seems probable that
they would have been seeded.

W ° I de mi nt Loop
I By BILL CABI1\l '

The most troublesome game of the intramural basket-

ball season was played last Thursday as Bruno’s Boys won

the Independent League playoffs by defeating the Drifters,

62-47. .  

The scheduling of this game and not the playing of it was
troublesome. The Drifters eluded a forfeit to the Nomads in the
semi—ﬁnals on February 26th. They arrived a half hour after for-

stead of giving the forfeit to the Nomads, Leo Bemis, intramural
director, rescheduled the game because he felt the Drifters were
the better team and deserved to play.

After the Drifters won their semi-ﬁnal game, they were
scheduled to play Bruno’s Boys last Monday for the Indepen-
dent championship game. This time it was the Brunos who
claimed ‘they couldn’t play because a player’s wife had had a
baby on Sunday. =

At four. o’clock on Monday, both Tom Black of the Drifters and
this reporter spoke to Bemis who said the game ‘was to be played
regardless of Bruno’s _protests. At game time, however, the Brunos
didn’t show and on Tuesday the Drifters were ‘notified that the game
was postponed.

Last Thursday the game was ﬁnally played, but not with-
out complications. It was scheduled to be played at Fitzgerald
Field House instead of the stadium gym, but neither the referees
nor Jim Young, intramural assistant, were present. H

Mr. Bemis said that he had told Young about the game but that
“he must have misunderstood me.” The game was refereed by two
spectators and the Bruno’s win earned them a spot in this week’s
championships. ‘

SEXAND THE COLLEGE GIRL is based on
hundreds of on and off campus interviews
with parents, teachers, and undergraduates
at more than 100 schools all over America'-

. from Big Ten to Bible Belt, Ivy
League to UCLA. interviewed by '
a prize-winning reporter and fea-
ture writer, the girls talk can-
didly about themselves-and"
about weekends, petting (“every-
thing but...”), promiscuity,
technical virgins, affairs, chas-
tity, curfews, motels, drive-ins,
status, marriage, and love. The
results are jarring educators,
fascinating undergraduates, and
keeping parents awake nights
throughout America.
