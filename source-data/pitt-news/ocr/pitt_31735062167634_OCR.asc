terview room, passing out anti- '
CIA leaflets and pamphlets. Jeff
Bauman and Mike Kosloff, RSU
members, were among those

— handing ‘out .leaflets. They were

waiting to confront the CIA man.
“We are purposely holding this
peacefully, because we wanted the

/opportunity to confront him.”

A SU official, Mr. Kolman, in- '

...i.ui¢  24, ion,

formed Kosloff and Bauman that
no demonstrations are permitted
within the SU. Kosloff replied.
“This is not a demonstration; I
think we’re a little beyond that
stage.” '

Kosloff spoke to a student who
was waiting for his interview.
“Why are you interested in the
CIA?” asked Kosloff. “Because
they wrote a brochure and I'm
very interested in it,” answered
the student.

Later, Kosloff asked another
student the same question. The
student replied, “I’m interested
because it’s a draft-deferrable
job.” “You wouldn’t be any safer
working for them than you would
if you were fighting in Vietnam.
They’re trained to assassinate
people,” responded Kosloff.

Kosloff, Bauman. and a few
other RSU people continued to
wait" outside the door. At 11 a.m..
after about two hours of inter-
viewing, the CIA representative
came out of room 0217 and left the
SU. accompanied by Mr. Kolman.
Kosloff and Bauman followed them
to try and get a statement. but
they left the campus without an-
swering questions. ‘

Pete told the audience that he

was asked by the Republican Par- '

ty. after he had beaten the Demo-
crats in the primary, to run as a
coalition candidate with the sup-
port of both parties. "They’re
willing to go along as’ long as they
get the candidate of thei_r choice,
a controlled candidate.” he con-
tended. "Four years ago the Re-
publican establishment support-

‘ ed the Democratic machine."

The independent candidate also
stated that this campaign has
been a first in Pittsburgh. “We’ve
seen a unique mayorality cam-
paign. It’s the first mayorality
campaign Pittsburgh has had in
20 -years.“ He also posed an-
other unique point about the cam-
paign, the fact that the Republi-
cans have spent over $750,000 on
this campaign.

Concerning his opponent, Flah-

by ELEANOR Animsrs
Staff News Writer

A proposal to establish credit

-for out-of-classroom learning was

"adopted in principle" by Under-
graduate Council Wednesday
morning. The proposal. submitted
by the Student Cabinet of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences (CASL
will be revised and resubmitted
to the Council for "final approval
at a meeting scheduled for next
week. -

Undergraduate students engaged
in research and study outside con-
ventional classroom work could
qualify for*‘University credit un-
der the "proposal. Eligibility for
credit would be determined by a
University faculty member‘s ap-
proval of a student's out-of-class
study program. Independent study
programs with faculty sponsor-
ship and extra-crricular activ-
ities which are closely related to
academic disciplines are the two

major areas of proposed credit. .

Active community service and
study abroad may also qualify for
credit if the student secures fac-
ulty approval’ and can demon-
strate in the form of a research
paper. or another valid method.

TIME——

He leaned closer, only slightly clos-
er, to breach their apartness, then he
kissed her on the cheek.

And at that moment, time on earth
ceased to be and all things were ar-
rested in the postures of an instant.
Trees in the park hardened as things
of stone in the quiver of tangled
branches and tousled leaves. The foun-
tain water held a second’s form, veil-
ing the nude cherub in a film of twisted
light and hanging over the concrete
bowl like sheets of shredded plastic.
Grass growing between the cement
slabs of the walk lay rigid, matted by
the footprints of the last living mo-
ment.

Businessmen who populated the
park during lunchtime stood transfix-
ed in poses of fatigue and boredom;
one eternally chewing the last bite of
his ham sandwich, another protecting
his hat from the breeze which no long-
er breathed through the city, and yet
another bending over his shoe at the
edge of the fountain, eyes rivitted to a
half-tied bow. A mother’s quiet anger
suspended in the stillness, her mouth
open in an endless shout to her truant
son who ran, sweat clinging to his tem-
ples and upper lip, grinning over his
,shoulder at the sound of the silent rep-
rimand.

And the postures of arrested life
were not limited to the square. In all
streets of the city, men stood damned
in crowds of fellow strangers. Scores
of people stood at that point of absurd
balance just before weight shifts from
street to curb. Drivers sat alert, eyes
on traffic lights, feet just easing off
brakes. A cigarette burned without be-
ing consumed in the hand of a man who
would spend the greater part of eterni-
ty trying to toss stub from his car
window. And in one of the alleys near
the center of town, darkened by the
shadows of the highest walls, a body
lay face down. A few feet beyond, a

man ran nowhere, his face twisted by

triumph and the most intense fear. V

Yet all were not silenced in the
open sunlight of that place. Some stood
buried forever in the twenty-story
tombs of the city, accursed in the
agony of incompleted purchases,
mouths‘ open, insensible hands yearn-
ing for the touch of cash. «A woman re-
mained suspended inithe frustration of
trying to return a blouse, the flash of
her anger never touching the nerveless
grin of the sales manager. And wheth-
er the cash registers’ ringing died in
the void ‘or rang forever in the eternal
suspension, there was no one to hear
or not hear.

And over all the wide world thus

were the people stilled. In the rain,’

drenched but not dripping, among the
broken clods of a new field, at tables
of food, in bathing pools, men caught
in all poses of the living self. They lay
dying on white-sheeted beds and piles
of blood-clotted rags; they remained
contorted in frenzied dances to ward
off spirits who were themselves froz-
en. In all, they were fixed in those pos-
tures which fade with each second of
time, the rhythm of whose appearance
and disappearance is the single move-
ment of the life of man.

And it was curious that over all the
earth, among all manner of men, there
was but one person in a posture of lov-
ing at that instant. No mother fondled

‘her suckling babe; neither did one

child cling to his father’s strength.
Hands shared not the moment’s
warmth; lips tasted no wetness in a
lover’s mouth. Among the animals,
perhaps, there was the bite of passion
caught in the stillness, but among men
there was no sign save that of apart-
ness.

Only in the park, in one space of
greenness, a man sat with lips brush-
ing a woman’s cheek. And had she wel-
comed that kiss, had her lips parted,
who can say what time would have
been?

Yet she did not.

Instead she gazed for an instant,
for the eternal instant, at her hand
resting on the ground.

So it was that man ended in that in-
stant, caught in his absolute humanity
and suspended there without time. All
movement was ended, all save the
thought of man. Thus he remained,

thoughts ranging freely over the earth-
lv tomb. intensely aware of the still-
ness, and the peculiar senseless cold.
There was no tiredness, no aching of
moveless limbs, nothing to divert the
imagination from the moment. And af-
ter the amusement of those caught in
the most ridiculous of human poses, af-
ter their amusement of tens of eons,

came the weight of eternal awareness.
To the lover in the park was gra_nt-
ed the peace of non-humanity, and he
became as a stone or a thing of ice.
Happily. 
Ever after.

by DAVE TIERNAN
“Aris! . . . Aris! . . . Aris!”

“I’m coming, Mom. I just wanta finish
this chapter.” ,

“I don’t know what I'm going to do with
that child,” Aris’ mother stated aloud as
she strode from the foot of the stairs tow-

. . ard the dining room.

' brother, but the memories he had were _

“What’s the matter now?’-’ Aris’ father
asked, looking up from the evening paper.

“All he does anymore is read up there
in his brother’s old room. He doesn't play
with the other kids on the street, or any-

thing anymore. And even if he just read, ,

it wouldn’t be so bad. But he only reads in
Butch’s old room. He won't read down
here. Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s normal
for a ten-year-old, I don’t know.”

Aris had finished the chapter of The
Rookie Who Made It, but he didn’t go down-
stairs. He sat on the floor of the large bed-
room and stared at the picture on the wall.
It had always interested him, but today it
seemed to be more appropriate. The tan-
ned image of his brother reminded him of
what “the Rookie” must have looked like
at that age. He could barely remember his

fond ones.
“Aris, get down here. Dinner’s-ready,

. and your mother called you 15 minutes ago.

And wash your hands before you come to

V the table.”

Aris felt sorry for his father. He always
seemed to be tired and unhappy. The only
time he smiled was when he was watching
the ball games on television and the team
he-was rooting for did something right. The
rest ‘of the time, he either sat in his chair
and read the paper or slept. “Hardiday

-down there today,” his father would say

when he returned from working in the
mines. And oftenhe would walk slowly
toward the stairs and say, “Have to get up

i ' early in the morning, gonna hit the hay ear-

ly,” and go to bed—often before the sun had

_slipped down behind the West Virginia
‘hills.

After dinner Arisexcused himself from
the tableand retreated to his favorite spot

~ in the world. He propped his back against

the neatly-made bed and continued his book.
But he soon lost interest and began to
browse through the drawers of his broth-
er’s desk. (He had often been tempted to’
look in the top drawer, but always limited
his investigations to the bottom two.) Here
he found numerous magazines containing
pictures of girls and cartoons, a few old
school books and notebooks, and clippings
from the Morgantown newspapers about
Notre Dame football games. He recogniz-
ed serveral of the names from the old No-
tre Dame teams as members of various
professional teams. '

Aris neatly replaced the clippings in the

‘ bottom drawer andclosed it. He sat in front

ofthe desk and stared at the top drawer. He
tried to remember the exact reason his
mother had given him for not looking in‘ the
"top drawer. He couldn’t even remember if .
she had actually forbidden him to look in _it
or if she had just warned him not to. He slid
his slight body toward the desk, and slowly
moved his hand toward the drawer handle.
As if anticip_ating an electrical shock; he
moved his fingers toward the handle and

. pulled them quickly away. He repeated ._this_

action three times before he let his hand
rest on the handle. He _slowly pulled the
handle, and experienced .a strange shiver
all over his body when he realized that the
drawer was not locked, as he had always

Q suspected..

. remember anythinghe could to
‘ fear to himself. ‘

The fear that crept over Aris’ body was
a new experience to him. He did not know
why he was afraid to look‘ into the drawer.’
He tried to strain his mind to its limits to
explain his

After long minutes had passed slowly
by, Aris slowly inched his head toward the
drawer. With great caution be stretched-
his neck and investigated the drawer with

, squinting eyes. His body was tense, as if

her-expected a snake to leap outat him. All
his eyes saw, however, was a tabloid news-
paper and some notepapergwith writing on

‘est Part for Butch." He scanned the page‘

and in the smaller print read that the news-
paper was the University of Pittsburgh’s
Pitt News. The date was November 22,
1968. “That was over six years ago,”
Aris thought as he began to read the story
under the headline.

FARMINGTON, W. Va. — Butch will never be~a stu-
dentat rm.

“l’ll probably end up in the mines, like my father,”
Butch said as he stared at the shampoo bottles on the
shelf of the Champion Coal Company Store. He, along with
hundreds of other friends and relatives, was waiting to
hear an optimistic word about the 78 miners who were
trapped in the coal mine a few miles away.

“They try to keep their spirits up," he said, looking at
some of the others. They were huddled in groups of four
or five‘, talking inlow voices. Their faces bore the same ex-
pression as Butch’s: sad, taut, weary; but their eyes told
the whole story. Many had kept the 36 hour vigil, waiting
for news of the trapped men, and their eyes were red and
swollen from lack of rest and crying. V

“We're like a country of our own," Butch noted. "We
live our lives in our own little ways during regular times,-
this is like a country during a war-‘—all the people band
together to help each other.'' ,

Butch is 18, and said he couldn't remember the dis-
dster in T954 which claimed the lives of i6 miners. He
also explained that after his graduation in June, he had .
applied to work in the very mine that now held 78 men
captive. '‘I could have been working the midnight shift,
too," e said. “Most of the new workers start off on mid-,

Although he had no relatives trapped in the mine, six

' of his friends were down there. “My father should have

been down there, too," Butch said. “He was going to
switch shifts with a friend so we could go hunting today.
He changed his mind at the last minute and decided to

’ work his regular daylight shift.

/

"The mines are all we have,” Butch reflected. “Most
of us want to get away, but in order to get enough mon-
ey, we work in the mines for two or three years. By then
we have forgotten . . .," he trailed off as an older lady
behind him began to sob loudly.  7

In his conversation, Butch explained the complex laby-
rinth of tunnels as most kidshisl age would explain the
single wing or the table of chemical elements. Between

the lines of his explanation, however, was the pessim- '

ism that was evident on the faces of the-others. He also
explained the gases, explosions, and fires that were
hampering rescue_attempts during the night.

"The waiting is the hardest part of this for us," Butch»
added after a pause. ‘‘If there was only_ something we
could do besides just standing around waiting . . ." Again
he trailed off, his voice choked with emotion. .

Many of the miners who were trapped were sons or '

nephews of the men who had lost their lives in me. I954 -

disaster. Butch explained that families who lose their fa-
thers do not move away, even though the company pays
them insurance. ‘

"They have no place to go," Butchsaid of the father-
less families. “They/have probably lived here for genera-
tions. This is the only life they know. To them the mines
are the only work their families have done since they
came to this country." , '

During his conversation, Butch constantly referred to
his father, whowas standing between’. the frozen food

Butch accepted the reality of a mining disaster. We
faced the reality of his future in the mines. He said that
the hardest part of the crisis for the people was the wait-
ing——the helpless, hopeless waiting. For the majority of
people, the waiting was just time until the deaths of the
men would be confirmed. Few were blindly optimistic
about the survival of the miners. They, too, accepted the
disaster as one of the dangers of the mines.

No, Butch will never be or student at Pitt. His future

is decided. All there is ‘for him now is the mines and the '

waiting—the hopeless,helpless waiting for the day when
he no longer “owes his sould to-the company store."

But for-Butch, that day will never come.

Aris reread the story and stared at the
picture of his father and brother for a long
time before he glanced at the.notepaper,
which he had almost forgotten about.

On the notepaper was a short letter. ad-
dressed to the person who had writtenthe
article in The Pitt News. Aris guessed
from the crossed-o_ver words that it must
have been a rough draft. As he read the let-
ter, he wondered if his brother had ever
mailed ‘a copy, and if he had, had he re-
ceived an answer.

The rough draft was short, and.A ris re-

_ read it. . ~

Dear Mr. Tiernan,

' Thanks for sending me a copy of
your story. I didn’t_.know how to take
it-when I read it the first time, but af-
ter I read it through a few times, I
seemed to get the idea you felt sorry
for me. Well, don’t, because I’m get-
ting out of here. I'm going to make it
alone. .» .

At the end of your story, you re-
peated that I will never be a student at
Pitt. Maybe not, but I'll never be a coal
miner either. I'm going to join the

‘service, and if 1 don’t ‘like it, I'll be

free from this place when I get out and
I can get a job somewhere else.

i I just thought you might want to
know. - H ‘

Butch

The story and letter brought many mem-
ories to Aris’ mind. He strained to remem-
ber all he could, but the facts of Butch’s de-

parture from home were no clearer to him :
than they had been the many other times

he had tried to remember.  I , _

. Within minutes he was asleep. It wasjlajtei
. and the long cry had exhausted him. 1   '

Aris stood up and looked at the clock,'.on;
the table beside the bed. It would soon--be:

cide when _be would ask his-mother. As he
thought about it more, he felt ‘he’ hadxtoj
know immediately. ~

He descended the stairs slowly,
over in his mind how. he would askhis ‘
mother about Butch. ' . _

Aris’ mother was in -the kitchen sewing‘ 3
one of his father's shirts when he ente_re_'d
from the dining room. She looked up from
her work as he slo'wly"walked across the
floor, then continued her sewing-. After _he-
stood in front of her for a while without’
speaking or moving, she looked up again. .

“Well?” X 

, “I, ahh, I wanted to ask you a question.’-‘l.

“Go ahead.“  

“What happened to Butcb?”«Aris blurt-
ed out.  ;

Aris’ mother "thought for a long time be?
fore she spoke. By the look in her eyes;
Aris could tell that what she would tell him:
would not be good. He felt a slight tremors. .
in his stomach, as if he was getting sick._,_g:‘..
He wished he had waited until later to ask,
for he sensed that his mother was going to‘__ [
tell him where Butch was, and he was 
afraid to hear. " 

“Well, Aris, it’s a long story, but if-.you-
'wa‘nt,’I’ll tell /you. I’ve wantedto tell you,
for a long time, but wanted to wait until you:
were old enough to understand. You see,"
when Butch got out of high school, he want-
ed to work in the mines like your fa,tl1_er‘.'?_v'
While he was waiting to be hired, there wasj
an explosion in the mines and many of,the'
miners‘ were trapped for days, and they

were never found.” g 
" ‘‘You mean‘ they all died?” be inter-’
rupted. , - 
.“Yes, theyall died.” “

Aris felt he should tell his mother that   ~
‘ he had read‘ the newspaper and letter, but i , 1
before he could decide, she continued.   A 

“Your brother decided to get away
from the mines and see what else he‘ could.
do. He said before he leftjthat he wasn't]
afraid of the mines, that he just wanted to i
see more of the world before he spent the 
rest of his life working here.” She stared 
at the shirt she had been sewing. , 1 1

“And,” Aris probed. “What happened
then?” T ..

“Butch joined the marines and was a
paratrooper. They’re the ones who jump_f ;
from airplanes, to rescue people in trouble.’_’

“I know that,” Aris replied, a little in- 7’
sulted, but too interested in what his moth-
er was saying to let it bother him. “Mom,
where's Butch now?” A '

“Aris, like I said, I wanted to tell you
this for a long time, but never knew when."
Your father never liked to talk about _it’,_
and every time I would try to discuss it}
with him, he would become very upset.”  1

' Aris looked at his mother very strange-_L_;
ly. He felt old, almost like a grown—up. He .1‘
wished he hadn't mentioned it, but knew it:
was too late to forget about it. He waited at:
long time before his mother spoke. '

“Your brother was killed in Vietnam .
about four years ago,” Aris’ mother said "
slowly. Her eyes immediately filled’with?"
tears, but they were tears for Aris not for
Butch. , * ' -

Aris stood in front of his motherwith
out speaking for what seemed to him to be;
half the night. Twice she looked at him as’:-
if she was going to finish telling the story,-.:
but both times she looked back to her sew-
ing._ Aris finally felt he should saysomie,
thing, but couldn’t think of anything tosay-H. 
He felt he should apologize to his mother,-V
but he didn’t really feel he had done any '
thing wrong. Then he turned, and withhi_
head bowed and tears in his eyes, he ran
through the living room, up the stairs, and
into his brother’s room. .-

while. Andy Mollura's been limb-
ering the leg in practice. placing
Joe Spicko’s job in jeopardy.
Spicko’s 40.9 yard punting aver-
age means his punting position is
safe. though.

Whoever does the kicking he‘ll
be wearing a different type of
shoe. along with the rest of the
squad. Because ‘of the Mountain-
eers’ new Astroturf. Carlen will
supply the Cats with special shoes.

Following two lopsided victories‘ over Cincinnati and Mary-
land, the West Virgina publicists issued tones ofvblurbs calling

 their team one of the greatest in the school’s history. Cincin-

Defensive Tackle

Penn State will hand you your
comeuppance.“

The Mountaineer faithful laugh-
ed. strode majestically into Col-

_lege‘ Park. and choked, as Penn

State handed their comeuppance.
Now. after two‘ weeks of soul
searching and wound licking, the
well-rested Mountaineers will be
out to prove to the Panthers that
their reputation is not made from
papier-mache. .

If statistics alone counted to-
ward the ratings,‘ West Virginia
would be the undisputed number
one team in the nation. Fullback
Jim Braxton and tailback Bob
Gresham, solving the riddle of the

nati and Maryland, the disbelievers were quick to reply, are not

Tulane then-fell before the WVU machine, and the fervent

Astro Turf, have rushed for 474
and 478 yards, respectively. Brax-
ton, who doubles as the place kick-
er, has clicked on 15 of 17 extra
points and three field goals to
compliment his seven touchdowns.

Coach Jim Car1en’s offense. us-
ing the ever-more-popular triple
option, has concentrated on its
ground attack. outrushing its op-
ponents by more than 1.000 yards.
Neglected though he has been.
quarterback Mikelsherwood is a
potent weapon in the West Vir-
ginia arsenal.

rick, Sherwood‘s favorite target.
has been lost for the season due
to a knee injury. If Carlen should
decide to unwrap his junior quar-
terback. wingback Wayne Porter
of Mt. Lebanon'High will be eager
to latch on to a pass or two.

West Virginia Focus

The Mountaineer defense has
been as stingy as the offense has
been prolific. Anchored by All-
America candidate Carl Crennel
at middle guard and tackle George
Henshaw. the rugged defense has
surrendered but 1,014 yards to
five opponents. Before the Penn
State game. the Mountaineers had
outscored their victims by 30
points a game.

But it is the specter of the Penn
State nightmare that continues_to
haunt the Mountaineers. Added to
the chorus of the reinforced cynics
are the nagging self doubts that
the Mountaineers must feel. That
West Virgina is good is beyond
debate. That they "are overrated
and beneficiaries of an ego-build-
ing schedule is a popular position
among football buffs. Just how
good they are remains a mystery
that the Pitt—WVU clash tomor-
row may begin to unlock. '

‘Today at West Virginia the booters will lbe trampinglon"

“new” ground in an attempt to avenge last season’s 3-0 loss.

But Coach Leo Bemis doesn’t anticipate any adjustment dif-
ficulties due to West Virginia’s new Astro-Turf. He noted that

Cleveland State ‘beat the ~Mou_i,1,-rig;

taineers. 4-1, on the synthetic
grass and afterwards mentioned
no problems caused by the Astro-
Turf field.

In addition to losing to Cleve-
land State, a team the booters
tied. 3-3, the Mountaineers drop-
ped a 4-1 decision to South Flori-
da and were bowled over by pow-
erful Navy, 8-1. Meanwhile, WVU
has knocked off Penn State, St.
Francis, and Jersey City State.
Their record stands 3-3-1.

According to Bemis, a much
greater worry than the synthetic
grass is the prospect that the_

“They've got a good team, but
they’re young. WVU has five or
six starting sophomores and
they’re coming into their own.
John McGrath. their first year
coach, has some excellent play-
ers,” stated Bemis.

Nevertheless, West _ Virginia
has only six lettermen returning
from last season’s squad which
thoroughly battered opponents and
did not lose until the'NCAA tour-
