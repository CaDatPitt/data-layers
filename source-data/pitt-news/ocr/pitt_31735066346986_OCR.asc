German Department

Gets $82,293 Grant

When Dr. J. Alan Plefier comes to the University this
fall to head the newly created Department of Germanic
Languages and Literature, he will bring with him the In-
stitute of Basic German which he directs and initiated in
1960 at the University of Buffalo.

The Institute has been awarded a contract of $82,293 by

the U.S. Department of Health,O~- -
and Welfare, accord-‘

Education,
ing to Dr. Charles H. Peake. vice-
chancellor for the Academic Dis-
ciplines.

Purpose of the project is to
develop a basic list of German
words, along with a sematic in-
dex. The index will guide teach-
ers of German and writers of
textbooks by indicating how
many times a given word is used
in spoken German as well as
the different meanings each word
has.

A Year in Europe

Dr. Pfeffer has spent a year
in Europe conducting research
for the Institute of Basic Ger-
man. He collected 400 tape re-
cordings which represent the
standard colloquial German spo-
ken in Germany, Austria, and
‘Switzerland -— ,Europe's major
German-speaking areas.

Research conducted with
2,000 German-speaking stu-
dents yielded written lists of
the common nouns, verbs, and
adjectives. The master word

-~ lists and the sematic index will

be assembled from these two
sources.

The list and index, along with
future studies to be conducted
in sematics, word patterns, and
languages structure are expect-
ed to improve the methods of
teaching non-academic German.

The entire project is scheduled
to be completed by August, 1953-
The total cost will be $151,504.

Tragedy of Error:

The recent atmosphereof confusion which surrounded
«the various deferred payment tuition programs offered by
the University and the Tuition Plan, Inc. calls to mind
the image of a giant whose left hand is unaware of the
actions of its mate.

As it has done for a large proportion of the student
body for several years, the University is continuing to per-
mit students to pay tuition on a trimester-long installment
plan. Recently, however, the University granted the Tuition
Plan, Inc. permission to offer parents of the student body

' life-insured, long-term installment programs for tuition

and other academic expenses. According to Jesse T. Hud-
son, Jr., comptroller and assistant treasurer, this was done
because “The University cannot afford such long-term
ﬁnancing.” ‘ -

The New York ﬁrm, backed by the Commercial Credit
Corporation, then promptly proceeded to inform each

‘member of the student body and their parents of their

ﬁnance program.

As has been previously pointed out, the letter which
the Tuition Plan, Inc., circulated stated incorrectly, but
nevertheless in large block letters, that no deferred tuition
payment plan other than their own would be made avail-
able to the University population. .

The officials of the Office of the Comptroller have
said that they were entirely unaware of the misstatement
in the letter, even though the circular was printed on
stationery headed with the name of that Oiﬁce.

It is further ironic that the administrative officials re-
mained unaware of the mistake as they continued to distri-
bute this same letter from their own Ofﬁce of Student Ac-
counts.

The next act of this almost unbelieveable tragedy of er-
rors unfolded when the oﬁicials still refused to recognize
the contradictory facts of the letter when they were point-
ed out in the pages of this newspaper. And while the Oﬂice
ﬁnally investigated the matter, the letters were still avail-
able to students on the twenty-fourth floor of the Cathedral.

Their investigation completed, the Office of the Comp-

troller has now acknowledged the mistake which brought

them several day’s worth of anguish over the numerous
visits and phone calls from concerned students. Hudson
and his associates have contacted the Tuition Plan people,
who have subsequently promised to mail out corrected out-
lines of their offer. In addition, the University is also in
the process of posting a clariﬁcation ofythe installment
plan situation to all students.

It is ineﬂiciency of this sort which costs the University
valuable labor, money and shading of student opinion.

I fell asleep during the  show the other
evening and had «a nightmare more horrible than

V Dante's Inferno. Strindberg’s Spook Sonata and the

complete works of Edgar Allen Poe rolled into
one peyote hangover. V

My TV DT began with the
image of an almost nude, blonde,
illiterate male speaking with an
announcer and an attractive
young lady. This personiﬁca-
tion of “Dynamic Tension” comic
book ads, I gleaned from the an-
nouncer’s babblings, was the one
and (thank God) only, world’s
champion wrestler, Buddy ,
Rogers. V . . '

After making several modest
but illuminating remarks about the fate of his next
opponent, Mr. Rogers indicated his female com-
panion and said: “I amire dis young lady vera
much, for not only is she bootiful and inelligent but
she has excellent taste which is necessary to be
president of my fan club."

The world’s champion wrestler and discerner
of good taste then climbed into the ring to grapple

‘ with a tightly girdled, dyspeptic individual whose

name I missed. Mr. Roger‘s conduct toward those
in ringside seats was unseemly for a world's cham-
pion anything. Rather than appearing appreciative
before fans who, as I later learned, could only
have crowned him for his fifth-rate histrionic abil-
ity, Rogers seemed inclined to rush at them like
a rabid prosimian.

Lower Bipeds

His immediate kinship to the lower forms of
bipeds became more evident as his time in the
ring progressed. Displaying an antagonism to his
opponent which would make a wounded lion look
like a fraternity rush chairman, Rogers snarled
throughout the preliminary formalities.

Evidently this is the only time that an attempt
is made to explain rules to the contestants. At any
rate, the world’s champion jumped the other beast
in ,a most unethical fashion as he was returning to
his corner to wait for the starting bell. Fortu-
nately my dreams have a Mosaic justice in them

and for a few moments Rogers was hurled, twisted
and battered in a fashion which would have 
duced a human being to a pile of mortuary,
scrappings. A rapid comeback, however, showed}
me the stamina and remarkable recuperative ab,ilg;t
ity which doubtlessly was responsible for Rogerfs I
championship. ‘  v
After the champion’s successful defense, thebik,
of undigested beef which was causing my nightﬁtg
mare presented me with an even more grotesqtxg,,,;,
series of unlikelies, among who appeared: a bald?’
headed creature sporting a mustache and fur unv:
derpants known as the “Mongoloid” or something;
to that effect; a stocky Arab who called himself,
the “Good Shepherd” but looked nothing, like 
biblical namesake; and ' an obese Negro who
squeezed skulls like soggy lemons. The climax of
my slumbertime spectacle came when one of 
grapplers was used as a demolition ball to ﬂatten‘?
the referee. With the omcial out cold, it wagon”, 1

Public Orgies , ~ . : 9

But the nightmarish element is yet to come.
These hideous orgies were not performed privately
but before spectators who seemed to enjoy and‘
believe this sadistic comedy with vicarious credul,-U
ity. Admittedly the faces beyond the first four rows
were pasted up photographs and the crowd roar
was more apropos to football cheering but those
which were real were imbued with bestial thirst
to see pain which I thought had died with the
Roman Empire. ’

I am rarely surprised by the occurances in my
dreams and have not allowed them to disturb me
since I started sleeping in beds without sides. The
announcer‘s final words, however, still ring in my
ears with a distressingly undreamlike quality. “See
over 1,000 pounds of muscular manhood in the ring
at Forbes Field. Coming soon. Tickets are avail-
able at Kaufmanns.” They sounded so real. Was
I really dreaming?

Seven Hours of Hell

Saturday evening at five a train pulled out
from Harrisburg. It carried baseballfans destined
to see the Pirates play the Phillies at Connie Mack
Stadium. Seven minutes later the train plunged
from the track and three of its
cars rolled down a bank and
came to rest in the Susquehanna
river. Inside the train were
Midget Leaguers, parents, and
other baseball fans.

I was having coffee in a
nearby hospital when the call
for help came in. Putting down
the phone, the doctor asked me
if I wanted to ride along. Al-
though I was only a lab assist— gm, __,
ant, I volunteered my services.

Within the hour we arrived at the accident scene.

Charlie and I offered to carry a stretcher. An
intern, Charlie has witnessed other scenes of trag-
edy. But he summarized what was around us with
“Christ, was a mess.” Below me and to the right,
three cars from the train were half submerged in
the river. Above was the railway. Lugging an end
of the stretcher we waded over bodies. The air
vibrated with steady moan, a moan which I soon
recognized to be that of injured people, some of
them dying. In front and behind me along the
tracks was strewn a scene too chaotic for motion
picture reproduction.

  

Pirate Pennant
In a crimson pool lay a Pittsburgh Pirate pen-
nant. The cardboard picture of the Bucs was
wrinkled from the blood. A sailor in dress white
was hunched over a blanket, his head in his hands,
heaving spasmoclically. He was part of a rescue
unit’ which arrived just before we did. At the
river’s edge a ﬁreman waded toward us carrying a
fellow in a Little League uniform. The man was
ﬁghting back tears, the Little Leaguer was silent,
his mitt clutched in a bloody hand.
Up and down the bank we moved, carrying in-

treat open wounds. A woman was lying on ‘her’
side, her arms pulled against her breasts.’ “Doctor, I
please give me something. It really hurts.” I didn’t
bother to explain I,wasn’t a doctor, but merely re-
minded her she had just received morphine.

I left the woman and continued up the row. I
stopped in front of a man. His eyes moved upward
to stare at me, then resumed their vigil on the
river. He was partially scalped. A few minutes»
and many casualties later I returned to check on
the woman who had requested something for pain.

{Q

Called Effective Drama

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Pitt Players presented an interpretive reading of “Spoon
River Anthology” last Thursday and Friday evenings as its
last production of the spring trimester.

The lengthy Edgar Lee Masters masterpiece was neatly
condensed by director Jeff Rash and the seven readers to an
absorbing sixty minutes of varied entertainments, ranging

from profound speculations on
life to wryly comic-commentary
on the human condition.

All of the human beings
are quite dead and quite buried
at the outset of “Spoon River
Anthology.” The seven read-
ers each took a multitude of
parts; residents of a small town
cemetery who suddenly feel
compelled to explain why they
have been planted.

The style of the production
varied among its participants
greatly. Several members of the
cast applied modern interpretive
reading techniques to the script,
while others appeared to be in-
dulging in "good old-fashioned
play actin’.”

This inconsistency was the
only flaw in this effective pro-
duction. Cindy Caplan, William
Bennett and James Hufnagel
shone in the former category,
while Esther Mandel, Pat Cratty
and Ronald Caplan concentrated
on the dramatic value of the
poetry. with Carol Harter some-
how shuffling between the two
camps.

Bennett sparked particular
interest with his speeches of
the “Village Atheist” and the
self-eulogy of the meek clerk
who willed himself to death at
the recognition of his own ab-
surdity.

Miss Cratty proved herself a
convincing actress in all of her
roles, succeeding in moving the
audience with her cry, “Sex is
the curse of life!" as she read
the part of the unfortunate im-
migrant girl who met only de-
floration in the Land of the Free.

Miss Harter described the sim-
ilar fate of Nellie Clarke, who
was ruined at the tender age of
eight years and who was never

deferrment plan, Hudson replied
that the University can't afford
it.

The letter being sent out by
Hudson asserts that the stu-
dents are required to pay their
tuition, fees, and for room and
board at the beginning of the
trimester when they register.
“This is not a new policy.”

The letter, however, goes on to
say “it is realized that there are
causes where these costs can-
not be met from savings, and it
‘is necessary to pay some or all
iof the total on an installment
basis.”

Four Alternatives

Four alternatives are sLig2gest(:(l
for such cases: a) The Tuition
5Plan, b) University Plan, c) The
,Bank Plan and d) State Higher
Education Assistance Plan.

The Tuition Plan Inc. loans
money for all college expenses
to students’ parents from one
to four year periods. The two,
5’ three, and four year loans are
3 life insured. The loans must be
1

repaid in ten, 20, '1 and 40
equal monthly installments re-
spectively.
§ The University Installment
‘plan starts with payment of not
,less than 25 per cent of total
trimester charges payable at the
time of registration.
 Small Service Charge
 No installments are granted
.for less than $50 and a small
%service charge is made calculated
at the rate of 4 per cent per an-
num on any installment.

Students using this install-
ment payment plan must com-
plete an application form each
registration period.

“Local banks and their branch
offices have established other
plans,” Hudson's letter states.

“Life insurance is provided un-
der the Bank Plan, which means
the student's education is as-
sured -— free from the possibility

of stamps issued.” The contest is
designed to attract artists.

Ex-Cats Find
Grind Rough

Many ex-Pitt football play-

ers are popping up on the

pre-season rosters of pro-
fessional football teams about

now, but some are already
pooping out.

Andy Kuzneski, last year‘s
center here, was released last
week by the Pittsburgh Steclers
who had picked him up as a free
agent. Kuzneski apparently just
couldn’t cope with the out-sized
competition at the pivotal post.

End Steve Jastrcmbski went to
Canada to try his luck, but he
quit after surveying the lot.
Larry Vignali will stay in Dental
School here and forego a chance
with the Pittsburgh Stcelcrs. who
also drafted End John Kuprok of
last year’s squad.

The C-Boys. Fred Cox and Bob
Clemens, are working out with the
Cleveland Browns and Baltimore
Colts respectively. Halfback John
Yaccino is getting a try out with
the New York Giants defensive
secondary which is seeking to re-
place All-Pro Dick Nolan this
year.

Mike Ditka of the 1961 team
and Rookie-of-the-Year last sea-
son is being tabbed All-Pro for
the Chicago Bears. Ed Sharock-
man is scheduled for pass pro-
tection work with the Minnea-
polis Vikings.

Joe Schmidt, a perennial All-
Pro at the center linebacker slot,
is back with the Detroit Lions.
Joe is the topic of a story in the
current issue of SPORT.

Other former Pitt men in action
and their teams are:

Dave Mills, Detroit Lions; Dave
Hodge, Buffalo Bills: Joe Walton,
New York Giants; Jim McCusker,
Philadelphia Eagles; Dick Haley
and John Reger, Pittsburgh Steel-
ers; and John Paluck and Jim
Cunningham, Washington Red-
skins.

Badminton Finals Near

The ﬁnals of the intramural
badminton and tennis tournament
will be held this week. In the bad-
minton singles, Barry Wetzel will
meet David Ruskin. Wetzel is
favored in the match. /

Wetzel will team up with Larry
Burch in the doubles ﬁnale to op-
pose Ruskin and Ray Hess.

The winner of the match be-
tween Bob Drew and Sandy Le-

» vine will meet Ed Brown for the ,4

tennis championship.

Exit State

Less than one-third of the
shoolboy football stars
taking part in this year's Big

33 classic are planning to
play ‘college, football in
Pennsylvania.

Penn State is almost certain to
get eight of this year's Big 33’ers
and three are headed for Pitt.
Nine of the stars are still un-
decided about their futures.

Leading this patient lot is Bill
Malinchak, a 6-1, 190-pound end
from Monessen who has 95 offers
to think over. It was said it was
between Pitt and Penn State and
the Lions seem assured of his tal-
ents. I

His brother is presently a stu-
dent at College Park.

Those coming tolPitt include.
tackle Tom Raymond of Browns-
ville; halfback Eric Crabtree of
Monessen; and tackle Jim Jones,
a 265-pounder from Easton.

Last year only seven of the
Big 33 players qualified academ-
ically for the University and Pitt
recruited three of those eligible.

Once again the Big Ten has
corraled many of the area's fin-
est grid products and arch-ri-
val West Virginia raided the
Pennsylvania towns with equal
efficiency. One of their prize
picks Wilkinsburg’s Rich
Martha, brother of Pitt's Paul.

Leoleos Stars

Chem. Engrs.

Top Intramural

Softball Loop

By STU BERNSTEIN
The Chemical Engineers
defeated the Losers last Fri-
day to win the Intramural

Softball Championship. Behind
the clutch hitting of Gus Leoleos
and Ed Kondis, the Engineers
displayed the same all around
play they evidenced all season,
stopping the American League
champs 7-2 in the softball finale.

Leoleos raised his season bat-
ting average to .565 with three
of the winners’ 11 hits. Team-
mate Kondis, who led both
leagues with a .636 average, add-
ed two more hits to the winning
total.

The Chemical Engineers’ four-
run first inning was the big blow
to the losers, who did all their
scoring in the second inning.

Winning pitcher, Leoleos, held
the Losers to eight hits in gain-
ing his eighth victory of the ‘sea-
son. Leoleos’s unblemished record
made him the winningest hurler
in both leagues.

The long-ball hitting that the
Chem. Engrs. showed all sea-
son was missing from the champ-
iomhip contest, but they made
each of their 11 hits count in
their winning effort.

Intramural Sports Director, Leo
Bemis, called the softball sea-
son “a fine display of team and
individual eﬁort.” He added that
this season's play was a great
improvement over last year, and
expressed hopes for an expanded
program next spring.

 

Bemis Names His

IM All - Star Team

The Chemical Engineers and
the Losers Dominated the All-
Star team recently selected by Leo
Bemis, Director of Intramural
Sports. The Engineers placed four
members on the team, while the
Losers added two outﬁelders to
the lineup.

Gus Leoleos and Ed Kondis of
the Engineers were selected as
the top pitcher and catcher, re-
spectively. Teammates Ed Pokrzy-
winski and Jim Wingard were
also named to the roster.

The Losers’ John Young and
Paul Ash, along with Jim Jaffe of
the Yankees, were selected to out-
ﬁeld posts.
