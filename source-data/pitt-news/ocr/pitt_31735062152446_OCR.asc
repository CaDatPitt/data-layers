Mr. Pillich has been active in the

The young tap dancers are in-

the essential part of the dance. It

Mr. Pillich has the assistance of

Mr. Pillich thinks that the course
in tap dancing, inaugurated with 
opening of the second semester, will
see a great improvement in the co-

means, when translated, that if a
young football player could ass

forty yards, then, dancing would
correct that defect to the extent that
next fall he would be able to pass
any distance. Likewise, if the arms
couldn’t put the ball just exactly be-

course in tap dancing would make

Cwens Will Convene

. At Allegheny, Apr. 10

Cwens, national sophomore hon-
orary activities fraternity, will hold
its sixth annual national convention
April 10, 11 and 12 at Allegheny
College, Meadville, Pa. Pitt will be
oﬂicially represented by Rose Marie
Demestichas, Col. '33, president of
the local chapter.

Owens started on the Pitt cam-
pus as a local club under the lead-
ership of Dean Amos in 1916‘, and
took the name Cwen from the_ old
Anglo Saxon word meaning
“Queens." During the next ten
years the organization grew and cic-
panded to other campuses until in
1926 it became a national organiza-
tion. .

Besides possessing the founder of
Cwens on our campus we have also
the national president,
Hal-1, Col. ’31, who has held this of-
fice for the past two years. _

Plans for _an extensive social pro-
gram for the week-end are being
made by the hostess at Allegheny
including the traditional formal ban-
quet on Saturday night.‘

Over half of the active 'chapte_r
here at Pitt plan to attend in addi-
tion to the oﬂicial delegates.

Annual Medal

National Chemists’ G r o u p
Praises Institute Work

Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B.
Mellon, trustees of the University
and founders of Mellon Institute of
Industrial Research, were jointly
honored this week by the American
Institute of Chemists with its an-
nual medal for “distinguished serv-
ice to the science and profession of
chemistry.” The award was an-
nounced Tuesday on the occasion of
A. W. Mellon’s 76th birthday.

Dr. Frederick Breithut, president
of the chemists’ professional or-
ganization, praised the work of the
Mellon brothers in no uncertain
terms. He said: “They have contrib-
uted to chemistry in its broadest as-
pects and have fostered industry by
their unselﬁsh efforts.

Since the establishment of Mellon
Institute in March, 1913, it has
grown from a single building insti-
tution to one re uiring two large
structures, a thir beingnow, in the
process of construction at Belleﬁeld
and Fifth avenues. At present 76
fellowships are being conducted by
109 industrial fellows and 31 assist-
ants. Important contributions from
artiﬁcial sausage-casings to novel
rooﬁ ' materials have been made in
the 1 years of existence.

Pitt Players Will Produce
‘Alice Sit-By-The-Fire’

When one is given the opportu-
nity to read diaries of a_very young
and very sentimental girl, without
incurring-_ the stigma of being a
snooper, it certainly is unwise to
D395 ‘ID the Opportunity. Pitt Play-
e,rs. by p_roduc_m-g Sir James M. Bar-
_rie’s “Alice Sit-by-the-ﬁre,” are giv-
ing everyone this opportunity.

_ “Alice S_it-by-the-ﬁre” reveals the
intimate life of all one 'girl’s fam-
ily. Barrie has  rated in this
ay (as he has in the plays he
ever wrote) all the little whimsicali-
ties, sentiments and heart longings
_of all human beings. And through
it all runs the usual Barrie humor.

Ellen Terry and Ethel Barrymore
have both starred in this play. Bar-
ne himself asked Miss ore
to play the part of the mother be-
cause he felt “that she would un-
derstand the part.” :

Makes Fun of Self

Barrie -always makes a little bit
offunofliimselfinhisplays. His
ﬁrst uiblished work was called
“Vaga nd Students” and revealed
the hfe Barrie and his fellow stu-
dents led. “Peter Pan” is, of course,
his best known production. How-
ever, “Alice Sit-by-the-ﬁre” has the
same qualities of the impossible be-
coming the possible under the mag-
ic of Barrie’s pen;

Pitt Players are rounding the play
into shape under the direction of
Carl Cass. . The day on which they
will present this comedy will be se-
eoted soon.

Pajamas, Purple At That,
Pertarb Lost And Found!

 

The attendants who listen to your
tales of woe at the lost and found
department are blase when it comes
to strange things turning up, but
there is a limit to everything! Nat-
urally, when one ﬁnds a pair of
purple and white silk pajamas hang-
ing around the somewhat prosaic
Alumni Hall, one cannot help but
think things.

The Pitt Players can’t be blamed,
for they don’t hold dress rehearsals
there, and even if they did, they
wouldn’t put on a boudoir scene. The
ﬁlmy unmentionables were found
wrapped up in a copy of the Pitts-
burgh Press, if that has anything to
do with it. Any ordinary pair might
start a sensation, but when a three-
piece combination appears, the
third part being. a sort of cape to
draw about the shoulders if the
weather turns cold, or if the fur-
mace burns low, ’nuﬂ’ ced.

The c_lescend=ant of the old-fash-
ioned nlghtie with puﬁed shoulders
and a ﬂannel bow in front has been
claimed, and for the sake of the
staid and reserved Alma Mater, we
sincerely hope that it never again
strays from home. Remember the
‘old adage, “Woman's place is in the
home,” and what's sauce for. a wom-
an goose (goes) for‘ her pajamas.

- Let it here be reminded that the
brewery odor emanating from the
vicinity of the lost and found oﬂice
is nothing but denatured alcohol,
used in keeping important mechan-

The Queen

The King

in MARGARET BEINHERR
By this time the most popular
Pitt coed is probably wondering why
Mrs. Post didn't add a chapter to
her famous blue book on “How To

Behave Though a Contest Winner.”

For Adelaide Hunter, despite h_er
experience in stage dancing, has
felt the natural embarrassment of
being suddenly thrown into a posi-
tion which is really trying at times.

Her ﬁrst trouble was newspaper
reporters, who insisted on asking
all kinds of questions, personal and
theoretical. Next came congratula-
tions. from other students-—-which
all sorts of important people tell us
are really hard to bear.

For of course every person, no
matter how popular h,e—-in the
generic sense——is, has th se friends
of everyday life to live ith. Peo-
ple who knew you when you wore
rompers, girls who went to grade
school with you, high school pals,
and ﬁnally fraternity sisters. To
them Adelaide is the girl who’s
wanted nearly every time the phone
rings at the Tri Delt house-—the one
whom Miss Nannah (the house-
mother) thinks is ju.st about -alright
—the eternal committee chairman

' and W. A. A. booster.

Naturally--or strangely -- Ade-
laide has a well—balanced theory of
life. She is, among tepid college
religionists, a Christian Scientist.
She can-—and does—carry on a con-
versation about everything from
Plato, success, the weather, men,
food, education courses, travel, false
teeth-—no, hers are real—-other peo-
ple’s we mean, the Bible, dieting—-
her only known insincerity is the
frequent remark: “I must lose
some weight right away.”

Although only men voted for her
in the popularity contest, there is
at least one part of her feminine
public who was glad that the Pitt
men showed their usual good judg-
ment in selecting some one who adds
to her beauty and friendliness the
intelligence and judgment of mind
which is seldom troubled by the in-
signiﬁcant and trivial, but has a
sure. sense of its own powers and

Woman’: Auxiliary

Hears Enron Talk

Professor Roswell H. Johnson,
head of the department of oil and
gas, well-known lecturer on eugenics,
spoke to the Woman's Auxiliary of
the Allegheny County Medical So-
ciety at the club rooms in the Key-
stone Athletic Club last Tuesday.
The subject, upon which he spoke
was “Eugenics.”

By SUNNY vvmsnaemn

Tediously wading my way through
the shrieking mob of fair ladies, I
discovered the Campus King in the
act of receiving a luscious blonde
kiss on his cheek.

I coughed, ostentatiously cleared
my throat, and after receiving two‘
or six displays of ‘affection not in-
tended for this toughened cheek, I
grasped the arm of Ralph Watson
Harkins and began a formal, inter-
view. _

Sometime in 1908 before Hoover
prosperity, a little bald-headed boy
graced the domicile of Les Harkins.
Innocently his blue eyes twinkled,
and in a childish voice piped,
“Where are the women.” Through
public school, and in and out of
Homestead High, the same innocent
query echoed, “Where are the wom-
en.’ '
Ralph’s ﬂaming. red hair, besides
being the bane of Pittsburgh bar-
ber’s existence, served as a stimu-
his for wandering girlish hands. He
entered the college of the Univer-
sity in 1927. In order to defray
his college enses, “Red”. worked
as a laborer in a Homestead‘ "mill,
and after a gruelling year at the
open hearth was advanced as secre-
tary to the superintendent. Ra1ph’s
fat er also is an adept -politician.

Maybe Red's experience. as cheer-
leader in high school prompted his
decision to pursue a legal career. Or
possibly it was because his brother,
Kenneth, who is a lawyer, discov-

Voifice as cheaply as one. Whatever
‘it was, “Red” will study law, titer
graduation in June.

At present, Ralph Harkins is

J working, as a private secretary to

Dick Powell. _

Ralph reads poetry and modern
novels. He admires the older poets,
and Coleridge’s “Kubla Kahn’? is
his favorite verse. Among the mod-
«.ern writers, he devotedly follows
‘Theodore-Dreiser and Sinclair Lew-
is. He sa s his favorite -humorous
column is ‘Pittpourri." (Is my face
red?)

His favorite diversions are bas-
ketball, women, swimming, ,-women
and dancing. And as proven by the
number of votes cast, by the women
in the University, Ralph is a mas-
ter of at least one of his diversions.
He is humored at the Theta Kappa
Nu igloo and was even treasurer
there for one year. One year.

His favorite girl in school is Miss
Adelaide Hunter, although one still
hears him ask, “Where are the
women?” _

Schenley At ROTC, Dance
The sixth annual mill ball,
held at Hotel Schenley last day,

has passed into history as one of the
most successful and colorful for-
mals ever held on the Pitt campus. .
The facilities of the Schenle were
taxed to the utmost to ban ethe
630 enthusiastic couples who crowd-
ed the ballroom. Austin Wylie and
his orchestra outdid themselves in
providing some of_ the best music
heard for a long time.

The blue and gold uniforms of R.
O. T. C. members furnished a pleas-
ing background for the evening
dress of the other ‘guests.
Promptly at 10:30. , the cured
march, ‘led by Cadet Flrst Cap?-8111
McLean, and Honorary Major Her-
mine Ruoﬂ’, got under way,‘ and

booth where Cadet Captain Edgar
M. Wittan, assisted by Honorary
Captain Olga Sekey, gave each lady
one of the favors, an onyx lavaliere
with the insignia of the Coast A1‘-
tillery Corps attached on the. stone.
Due to the attendance, which ex-
ceeded the most optimistic estimate
of the committee, there was a short-
age of favors. These have been or-
dered, and the military department
has the assurance of the manufac-
turers that they will be. "mailed dur-
ing the week. -

tickets sold have been tabulated,

political science at the University,
addressed members and‘ alumni of
Lambda Alpha Phi, national legal
fraternit , at the University, at a
meeting eld on the seventh ﬂoor of

This lectur: was one of a series
dealing with current legal problems
to be presented -to the fraternity
during the ‘year. Dr. Schramm made
an extensive,study of legal machin-
ery in Allegheny county in 1928, and
is a widely recognized authority on
the subject.
At the next meeting to be held
on Monday, the first of the moot
court arguments for the present se-
mester will take place. Ben Sieger

several sizes of scrap books. What's
more important is that they cost
very little——the dollar ones are really

Dance Crowds -
HE MILITARY BALL, last. Friday, was

successful from the ‘ point. of

view of numbers. That itwas altogether a so-
cial success will be disputed by those in attend-
ance. Therecan be slight pleasure when each
step‘ forward means that [one can be expected
to be pushed‘ back twice asfar.
’, The spectacle of seven hundred couples at-
tempting to dance on a ﬂoor that is crowded
when occupied by half that number is truly a

Again, when all pretense of a

grand march must be given up and favors are
handed to those persons who are the most suc-
cessful in -a free-for-all scramble, it becomes
highly expedient to guard against such a ‘re-
currence at future University dances.
, Like the man who buys a railroad ticket and
ﬁnds that he must stand‘ during his journey,
the student who purchases a dance ticket and
comes to ﬁnd the" capacity of the ﬂoor greatly
overtaxed, is being imposed upon. .
What was true of the Military Ball_ has been

dances this year and for this

reason the committee in chargeof last week's
affair should not be censured too severely. It
is entirely proper, however, to ask them why
they continued to sell tickets, although the floor
was already too crowded for pleasure and the
number of favors was too small?

At future dances, the ticket sale should be
carefully restricted to a number that will make’

a ﬁnancial success and a social

pleasure. This may be done by refusing to sell
tickets at the door, or by selling only as many
there as will enable the committee to meet ex-
penses. . Underthis plan only those students

buy ‘tickets at the door will be

admitted. Such arrangements will be feasible

As opposed to "the aim in boxing
which is to win the ﬁght, the object
of the duel is to prove the courage
of the combatants? A duelist wins
respect from the other students and
receives honor if he can keep him-
self -and his temper under control.
He must not step back from his as-
signed position or he is disgraced,
dishonored and defeated. Dr. Tietjens
has the two badges of his courage
and he wears them on his face for
all the world to see.

In dueling a stabbing blow is not
permitted. Injury must be inflicted
with a cutting blow, and points are
awarded for “cuts" on the opponent.
A step back from his position, how-
ever, 's much more to a duelist’s
discr 't than a score of cuts and
scratches.

Dr. Tietjens has not kept up his
fencing. At present he is working
on streamline designs for interur-
ban cars. His researches have shown
that from 30 to 50 per cent of the
power required by high-speed cars
and trains can be saved by reducing
wind resistance to a minimum. 43

Scribner Gives
‘-‘Papyri’,’ Talk

Describes Plant And Rolls;
Shows Specimens.

 

 

Speaking on the subject, “Glean-
ing from the Greek Papyri," Pro-
fessor Henry S. «L Scribner, head of
the Greek department, delivered the

seventh of the series of faculty lec-
tures Wednesday afternoon.

Professor Scribner described the
papyrus plant, the making of the
papyrus rolls, andtheir use and val-
ue, as well as, the ﬁndin of the
papyrus in tombs and ash eaps of
the Egyptian Fayum.

‘From the great Zeno papyrus
and from others,” the" speaker
stated, “the administration and eco-
nomic life of Egypt under the Ptol-
emies are now for the ﬁrst time
revealed." The Greek professor
then went on to point out how it ,is
possible to picture the daily life of
the common people and the natives
of ancient Egypt from the non-lit-
erary papyri, many thousands of
which have been found.

«Professor Scribner concluded his
talk with the exhibition and com-
ment upon a specimen of an origi-
nal Greek papyrus document, ‘and
also of arare book describing Bibli-
cal papyri found in Thebes, Egypt.
Both exhibits were loaned by Dr.
Avienoff, director of the Carnegie
Museum. ‘ ‘

my ego was sadly warped the other

should be abolished. How I would
enjoy a nice hot debate on the sub-

Pittsburgh permitted and he were
willing!

One experiences a. great man in-
teresting sidelights in this business
of ‘photography. This year, to date,
I have photographed from ﬁve to
eight thousand students in various
institutions throughout the country.
If I can please over half that num-
ber, I am hap y. No photographer,‘
living or dea , ever pleased every-
one he photographed. Some people
refuse to be, ﬂattered, while others
take to a camera like Mencken takes
to cynicism. Some appear absolute-
ly devoid of character, while others
reproduce in their ‘pictures more
than they actually have. There are
certain types of women, beautiful,
roseate with color, and yet be the
photographer great or just a “year-

To‘ the Editor of the Weekly!

Permit me to say a fewthings in
.fg_vo;- of the Weekly editorial man-.
agement in answer to the letter from
Mr_ Dave Cornmain printed in the
last issue. '

Mr. Cornman observes that the
complete lack of space in the Weekly
devoted to material of any artistic
or intellectual interest is a comment
upon the caliber of the men and
women the University is educating-
It is a comment altogether ,_too_ true.

It shouldbe understood that I am

those who are interested enough in
the school to take a hand in running

It would be impossible for the

bad policy. The paper is. however.

Higher Educational” Trends
' Is Theme Of Topic

 

 

“The trend of higher education is-
discarding - childish tendencies and
ideas,” declared -Miss Thyrsa Amos,
dean of women, atthe weekly‘me’et-
ing of the Inquiry Club last Wednes-
day. The topic for her address was
“Trends in Higher E_ducati_on'."- A '

.“T,he. antagonistic status of teach-
er-student rel-ationship“. must, of
necessity, become abandoned,""‘she
said. “They must realize that they
are no longer opponents in a game.
We have to give up the childish
ideas of service and up-to-dateness;
and we have to completely. discard
in higher education‘ the departments
that are of non-academic grade.
Utilitarianism is not the goal of
education. certainly and‘ we» must dis-
card the vocational ‘stress which im-
pairs the academ_ic.”- .- I. .

Miss Amos explained the experi-
ment in higher education which the
University of Chicago will attempt
this fall: She sugg_es-ted; .-
though the ‘four-year plan which
President Hutchins ‘ will attempt
might __ fail, she nevertheless was
strong in -her appeal for at least a

Almost ninety men reported to
Jock Sutherland for spring football
practice last Monday. This number
included almost thirty from last
year's varsity squad, twenty from
last season’s freshman team and
about forty new men.

This past week has been ‘devoted
mainly to calisthenics, hitting the
charging machine, driving into _the
tackling dummy and other exercises
intended to limber up the players’
Some time has also been
spent in practicing aerial offense and
defense, signal practice and drills in
the fundamentals. _

This next week will see Suther-
the squad into. teams
with the assistant coaches teaching
the candidates their various duties.

' The linemen will practice charging,

- passing, punting and tacklin

blocking, tackling and breaking
through. The backs will go over the
complete list of their functions,
which include cutting, blocking,

One serious problem of
land is to ﬁnd a capable kicker. Last
year there was ‘no one who could
takeover the punting duty of Eddie
Baker and perform it as well ‘as
might be wished. This year with

. Baker gone, it seems as if the Pitt

eleven will be badly handicapped
unless some kicker is developed or,

,  jay some mi_ra_.cle,,t_urns up without

any advance notice. So far Suther-

land has had Rocco Cutri, last year's

substitute quarterback; Hogan, last
season's freshman signal caller; Paul
Reider, varsity halfback, and Cap-
tain Eddie Hirshberg, all booting;
Although in the ackfleld a ole
which needs to be badly ﬁlled is that
of quarterback, in the line every

_ position can be ﬁlled by experienced

performers or by up-and-coming
members of the old freshman group.
From center, held down by Daugh-
erty or Tormey, to-ends, ﬁlled by
players like Hirshberg, Timmons,
Collins, Dailey or Skladany, every
spot is airtight. Sutherland can give

 a- sigh of satisfaction and relief

Kowallis Undergoes
Operation On Elbow

Willie Kowallis, a regular on the
basketball team for the past two
years, underwent an operation on
his right elbow Tuesday evening.

The elbow was first hurt by K0-
wallis when he was a child. It never
properly healed, but Willie contin-

 

aed to play a ﬁne brand of basket- -

ball despite this handicap.

The arm was injured once more
this season in the ﬁnal game of the
Panthers’ mid-western trip against
Creighton, the injury forcing him
out of the lineup until the game
New Year’s night with Indiana at
the stadium.

After the close of the present sea-
son, Willie was advised by physi-
cians to have an operation per-
formed and he agreed. The opera-
tion will not cause him to be absent
from his class rooms, but he will be
forced to carry his arm in a sling
for several weeks.

 

Kaufmann Speaks On
Unemployment Plans

“Unemployrnent” was the subject
of an address given yesterday by
Edgar Kaufmann, chairman of the
Pittsburgh Plan for relief of unem-
ployment, to members of the busi-
ness conference group. at 315 Alum-
ni Hall.

The business conference group,
composed entirely of seniors, meets
fourth hour every Thursday, under
the supervision of A. H. Armbrus-
tcr,_ acting» «dean -of the school of
business administration. j

 

Siithep -

be much lighter, but, st

reasons, the races for the champion-
ship of the various sections were
very interesting, no team beingsure
of the title in ‘its league until its
schedule had been cpmpleted.

In section A, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon, defending champions, and Phi
Delta Theta went through their first
four games undefeated and met last
week to decide the championship
which was won by the latter team in
the ﬁnal minutes of play, 14-12.

A playoﬁ’ was necessary to decide
the championship of section B,
Sigma Alpha Mu, Delta Tau Delta,
1. 1 Kappa Sigma winding up their
regular playing. season with four
victories and one defeat on their
records.

Kappa Sigma opened its season
with a victory over the Delts, 13-11.
They lost their second game to S. A.
M., 16-14, but the Delts turned
around in the ﬁnal game of the
season to defeat the Sammies 16-8
and cause a triple tie for the sec-
tional leadership.

The latter two teams met Tuesday ‘

evening .at Trees gym in the first
game of the playoff series, the
iappa Sigs having drawn the bye,
and the Sammies reversed the count
on the Delts to. win, 15-7. The
Sammies and the Kappa Sigs played
last night for the loop championship.
The race in section C was the most
complicated one of the three. This
circuit started out with seven teams
composing the league, one more than
were enrolled in -the other sections,
and when Theta Kappa Nu dropped
out of section B and Delta Sigma
Phi was transferred to section B, the
schedule for section C had to be
revised. '
In the revision of the schedule,
several mistakes were made and this
causedmany complications and de-
lays. After the diﬂiculties had" been
smoothed over Phi Gamma Delta
played Kappa Nu in a game which
oomed as a championship affair.

The Kappa Nus won this game.
_,12+8,. but af__ter._the game _had_ been
completed, an error was discovered
in the score-book. Yotfe, a forward

for the winners, had had four per-'

sonal fouls charged against him be-
fore the end of the third quarter
when the teams were tied at 8 points
apiece, but due to the fact that the
scorekeeper had listed one of these
personal fouls as a technical one, he
was permitted to remain in the

me.

The Phi G‘ams protested the game
for that reason, and it was ordered
replayed. The ame took place
Tuesday night wit the Kappa Nus
again emerging the victors, 17-13.

The Interfraternity Athletic Com-
mittee has made a change in the
awards to be made. No cup will be
awarded to the team ﬁnishing in the
runnerup position as was announced
in last week's Weekly. ,

EDDIE BAKER
The above picture shows Eddie Baker, captain of the Pitt foot-
ball team last year, banding a ball to Eddie Hirshberg, who will
lead the Pitt gridders in their fall conquests this year. The scene"
took place Monday afternoon which marked the

spring training period.

No Date Set

For Practice

Carlson D e f e n d s Sessions
Despite Opposition

 

In accordance with the custom
adopted three years ago, the Pitt
basketball team will go into spring

training‘ in the near future. No deﬁ-

nite date has been set as to when
the practice sessions will start or
through what length of time they
will extend.

Despite the talk of over-emphasis
concerning collegiate sports, the Pitt
authorities have seen fit to have
spring basketball practice. The feel-
ing of Coach Carlson in regard to
spring training is the same as that
of Head Football Coach Sutherland
concerning football. Carlson feels
that due to the short time which the
basketball team has to prepare it-
self for the schedule which gets
more pretentious every year, it is
necessary to have spring training to
get the newcomers accustomed to
the Carlson system, which is very
involved.

After the national championship
team of 1927-28 had been broken up
by the graduation of “Sykes” Reed
and “Stash” Wrobleski, the first
spring practice was held in the en-
suing spring. The practice was
very‘ beneﬁcial as the record of the
team the following year bears out.

Spring practice was held last.

gvoear and the year before, and the
ys who were out felt no ill effects
so the custom will be continued.

LEAVE FOR EAST

 

Hiram Howard, chairman of the
Pitt Panther, and Merlin Chute,
business manager, left yesterday for
New York where they will attend

0 the annual convention of the As-

sociation of College Comics of the
East. They are making the trip by
automobile and will return Monday.

F rash Boxers

Meet Rankin

Will Open And Close Season With Match

Against High

School Team

 

The Pitt freshman boxing team will open and close its ‘season simul-

taneously tonight against the Rankin high team at the latter team’s gym.

No deﬁnite lineup has been chosen

being

sure of seeing action for the Panthers.
Patterson, Joe Milutis and Jack Schricker.

for the Pitt men, but three men
These three are George

Patterson appeared in the opening meet of the season for the pan-

‘there against the H. T.'Little club,
winning his bout. Patterson had
some experience last year while he
was a student at Mercersburg Acad-
emy, and this advantage should en-
able him to defeat his younger and
less ex erienced opponent.

Joe llvlilutis fought in both the
Little club match -and in the one
with Duquesne. He did not win
either of his bouts, but his steady
improvement since then should stand
in his favor tonight.

Jack Schricker, although only a
freshman, is the outstanding colle-
giate boxer in Pittsburgh. He won
his ﬁghts in the matches with the
Little club and with the Dukes, and
last week when the Panthers met
the Mountaineers at Morgantown,
he fought an exhibition bout with a
West Virginia freshman whom he
easilydefeated. but unfortunately,
his victory did not count ill the ﬁnal
score of his team.

He will be a big favorite to win
his ﬁght tonight and to close his

-first season-of collegiate competition

with a perfect record.

’and he made a favorable showing in

_ The varsity team will not see ac-
tion again this year. The match
originally scheduled with Carnegie
Tech for tonight was called off by
the Tai-tans because of the wear of
the strenuous training grind upon
the _Tech boxers and because of the
punishment which they have ab-
sorbed in their ﬁghts to date.

Efforts were made last week to
schedule Washington and Jeiferson
College, conquerors of the Tartans,
in place of the latter team, and ar-
rangements had practically been
completed when the students at lit-
tle Washington decided to strike.
Téie match was consequently called
o .

Despite the end of the regular
season, the boxers have been going
through their daily practice grind in
an attempt to gain experience for
next year. Not one man on the var-
sity team will graduate this year,
leaving;-prospects for -next’ season
very bright.

co... Luck!

-will Meet--At Annapolis

For 0-Ass-ociation Title

The Pitt varsity riﬂe team will close. the most successful season in.
the history of the University tomorrow with the shooting of the National
Riﬂe Association shoulder-to-shoulder match at Annapolis. After a poor

 

three weeks and its average total scope for the same period of time is 1,412.
The average of the team for the‘°'

stsrtfthe team began to improve and will end__the season with a record of
_' .12 matches won and 8 lost. The team-has not lost a match in the last

entire season’ is 1,885. The best
average of any player is that of
 Hempel, who has a score of
Backlsn with an avers e‘ of 275.3.
I-Ismpel also has the hig estaverage
for ‘any one position, a score of 98.7
in the prone.

The best score the team made dur-

when it rung up a mark of 1,431.
The lowest score was made in its
iigxgzs match when it totaled only
I ' . ‘ ,

During the last three weeks Pitt
defeated successively Kansas Aggies,
Gettysbur , Columbia, Virginia Poly-
technical nstitute,' Syracuse, Johns
Hopkins, Washington ‘ University in
St. Louis, Maryland, Stevens Insti-
tute and Penn, State. 1 . s .
. The team left last night for An-
napolis where it hopes to have ii
great deal to say. concerning the
college which will bear the title of
national champion for the next year.
Considering the excellent scores it
has made lately,-it is as likely as not
that its hopes will be fulﬁlled.

power and industrial processes . . . andtthe
Crane contribution to help make it possible.

In carefree days “before the war,” a steel’
belt was a steel bolt. It was made of any
easily obtained steel that forged easily and
took threads well. Industry moved forward
. . . stronger bolts were asked for. Ordinary
steels were improved to tensile strength of
45,000 pounds. Not enough. A bolt with
forged-on head -and tensile strength of
50,000 pounds was developed. Still not
enough. Cold rolled-steel bolts with tensile
strength of 80,000 pounds were oﬁ'ci-ed.
‘ They had atcndency to snap. '

To fully meet the dcmandsof modern high
pressure and temperature technology, Crane
Co. brought out for its cast and forged steel
materials their Triplex steel stud bolts, of
"chrome nickel steel with tensile strength of I

ints .

I 2 5,000 pounds. The limit is not yet. Even

140,000 pounds and retaining strength at
well past i000° F.

entirely new for ‘T’. . A. The dance

tertainment: there will be natural,

character, tap, toe, folk, acrobatic I

and classical waltz dance features.
. Gretchen Brooks, Ed. ’32, general
chairman o_f Coed Dance Night, will
do a natural ” dance entitled
“A.rachne.” In this dance she will
‘interpret one free hour of a spider,
--an hour which is given to her by
the Gods—to let her curved arms
free.’ The costume is very colorful
and the effect is real.

The Kahr Sisters will play before .

the performance. This ensemble in-

, cludes four violinists and one pian-

ist. An additional feature of Coed
i-Dance Night will be the ten minute
intermission during which Mr. Ste-

Revised Constitution

Put To Vote Monday

(Continued from Page One)

medicine with 251 men and phar-
macy with 270 men will each be
given one member in the legislative
division of M. S. G. A. _

If the constitution is formally
ratiﬁed on Monday, the present Stu-
dent Council will meet in special
session next Wednesday to appoint a
nominating committee which shall
name candidates for the various of-
ﬁces and seats in the legislative
chamber of the association. This

system will be employed only this

year, all such nominations in the
future being made by a standing
committee of the association.

End of Council

Passage of the M. S. G. A. con-
stitution also means that Student
Council will cease to exist this
spring and segregated student gov-
ernment in the form of a W. S. G.
A. and an M. S. G. A. will -be set
up in its place. It is proposed by
the supporters of the M. S. G. A.
constitution, as well as by the ex-
isting Student Council, that once
segregated student government is
established, a joint committee con-
sisting of representatives from each
legislative group shallbe formed to
pass on matters of general Univer-
sity policy, affecting both men and
women students. ,

Suddenly awakened from the pass-
ive attitude of indifference which
has held them ever since the M. S.
G. A. ideaf was ﬁrst discussed last
spring, Pitt men in the past few
days have begun. to take an active
interest in the referendum of next
week. Speculations-over the out-
come of the vote are rife on, the
campus with supporters of the meas-
ure predicting that the constitution
will be ratiﬁed by big majorities in
every school.

Considerable opposition is ex-
pected to be met in the Dental school
which at present boasts its
quota of ﬁve \members on Student
Council. Under the new plan of
government, this school will have
only one representative because of

Council and with it their strangle

to be settled in the vote here. Ad-
vocates of M. S. G. A. and Charles
Edwards, president of Student-
Council, himself a dental student,
profess to see the passage of the
measure by the dents, although they
are unwilling to predict the size of
the majority.
Qualiﬁcations

Qualiﬁcations for voting on Mon-
