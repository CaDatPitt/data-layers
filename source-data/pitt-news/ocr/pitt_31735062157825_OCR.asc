Ilartl Race Forseen in Battle
To Elect 23 Representatives
For - Congress and ifauncil

VVith the bitterest elections in many years expected men
voters go to the polls tomorrow to pick eight Student Congress  ‘
representatives and ﬁfteen new members of Men ’s Council._

Interfraterniity Council, ﬁghting to maintain its long con-
trol of student government, declined to release its slate of can-'
didates until nearly the time of election. At the same time the
Council took the unprecedented action of threatening to slap
a $20 ﬁne on any fraternity whose member runs for office With-
out Council backing. '

Cause of IF’s stiff: warning was an opposition slate com-
posed of Independents, Engineering and Mines Association, and ‘
various unaffiliated groups. ~ - '

Led by ex—Congress member Stu VVorkmaster the “Coali-'
tion” formed soon after the "nominations were made and de-
cided to back the following men: Bob McKowen, Bill Dean, Lou
Cecconi, and Dick Swierzck for senior Congress posts. _

' Among the Junior Candidates they hope to elect Roy Nel-
son, Ralph Douglas, Jim Donaldson, and Vic Schmidt. 

Though at the time the News went to ‘press IF had not ‘
released the names of their candidates it was ‘thought that it
?would chooseBill Swanson, Budd Schulberg, Dick Campbell, .

  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
   

This is how you’ll vote. ‘ _ .

i All college, ‘bus ad, and education students will vote in 3
the Commons Room from 9:30 a.. m. to 4:30 p. in. There ~will_;-I
be four lines arranged alphabetically and approximately 20_:._
voting booths. '  _
Engineering and Mines students will vote in Sta.te,Ha.1l at-~_
same hours as above in Student Lounge. ' '1' "
Ellsworth Centerites, with the exception of Center Enginf
eering students, vote in Room G2 at the Center. Ellsworth En;
gineers must vote at State Hall. _ ~ 5
Pharmacy School polls will be open only from 11:30 to

1 :30 in the Chem Lab on the Oﬁice Floor of the Pharmacy Build.
mg. ‘ ‘ ' 
Every student must have an ID ‘card or axvalid’ schedul__
card before he will be permitted to vote. He can vote for. four
junior and four senior men for Student Congress. He can vot
for Men’s Council nominees from his class and school. . '-

and either Dozie Frazier or Carleton Knox for seniors and‘ Ra ‘"1
Maher, Howard Greenberger, Dave Clelland, and Don Murray fo
juniors. ‘fl,

IF’s slate for'Men’s Council is also a..close secret but it will ‘b
of little importance since the Coalition has not eveniattempted to ﬁel
candidates for the Council openings. ' » - 

No reason for IF’s secrecy was advanced, though it was though
that IF’ either feared that an announcement would put the Coialitio
into a position to back men for Men’s_ Council or that it would giv.
time for opposition inside the fraternities to form an alternate slate

Though the IF slate itself-was a well—kept. secret since its'for
mation last Tuesday, the news of the threatened ﬁne leaked on
‘fast and spread faster. But any opposition that there may hav
been within the fraternities seems to have died. - I ‘  .

Before election time six men who presumably were not on th
Frat approved list dropped out of the race. They were-‘Roy’ Titch
worth, candidate for junior position on Student Congress, and Han
.Syzmanski, Bill Krayer, George Hitchins, Harvey Douglas, and

  
   

Sullivan, all candidates for Men’s Council. None of the six oﬁere

THE RULING HAND
It has been an open secret for a number of years that the
Fraternities were the owners and operators of the male por-
tion of Student government. But last week IF Council decided
to drop the secret part and bring its proprietorship into the
0 en. ' A
P That, in effect is what it did with its recent decree that
a fraternity would be subjected to a 20-dollar ﬁne for any of
its members who ran for a student government post in oppo-
sition to the IF slate. This means that in the future any fra-
ternity man nominated by the Student Congress nominating
committee will be told by IF Council whether or not he shall
run

  

IF Council‘ defends its‘ ﬁne on the grounds that it is
needed for party solidarity. That would hold true if candidates
were nominated byiparties. But under the current arrange-
ment of nominations by a Congress-appointed committee» it is
making.IF Council the arbitor over a list of nominees theoreti-
cally nominated by a non-partisan group.

‘ VVhatever the weaknesses of the present nominating pro-
cedure, and they are many, Student Congress should be the
one to change it. On the basis of. past performances itéis cer-
tainly that IF Council can hardly qualify asan impartial judge
of candidates. I .

I think that’s a pretty, true state-

been at Pitt I’ve become “mixed
up about” a lot of things. For in-
stance,’ on page 77 of the College

Don't Know Answers

However, there are a greatmany students who don’t know
. the right answers, and who are afraid to just “accept” the
obviousbecause it could be wrong. They don’t know how to
"ﬁnd the official answer. _ ’

These students, rather we stu-
dents, would appreciate having a
member of the faculty who we
know’ personally and who either
. could answer our.questions or di-
rect us to someone who could.

I had a little experience which
is oneof the reasons I'm in favor‘
of the advisor plan. I have some
interest in entering_ one of the
special schools in the University.
According to the College Bulletin
 thereis a special bulletin for that
school which can be gotten at
either the Registrar’s Ofﬁce or then conferred privately, and sug-
from __any member of that par- gested I return the next week.

Faculty Aid‘ Effective ‘ ‘ ‘

A few days later I was’ discussing my dilemna with a mem-
ber of the faculty who called the head of the department.
I had my bulletin and an interview with the department head
the next hour. .
One of the major criticisms of
the plan is that it would take away
initiative on the part of the stu-
dent. The plan could very easily
develop into that, where the stu-
.dent runs to the advisor for every-
thing from planninghis schedule
‘to his inability to secure a book
for a class. i
in . However, while this could easily
happen, it doesn’t necesarily have
to: ‘ That would be the job of the
-advisor—-that he only advises and
‘hot directs.

even more _ bewildered than he
was. ' .

True, there may be very obvious
answers to these questions. So
obvious that they may even ap-
pear stupid or silly to those who
know the answers.

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
  
 
 
    
  
   
 
  
  
    
 
 
  
  
  
   
    
  
   
 

ticular department. .

Knowing how to ﬁnd the Regis-
trar’s Oﬁice, I decided to try there
ﬁrst. I went up to the 18th floor,
where I was politely directed to
the College Oﬁice across the hall.

I followed directions and went
to the College Ofﬁce which sug-
gested that I see a member of
the department. Stil not giving up
hope I went to the department,
asked about the bulletin. Two sec-
retaries gave me blank stares.
They hunted around fora while,

Pitt is a large school. So large
that the entering student very
easily loses sight of himself. He
thinks of himself’ as lost and un-
important. This shouldn’t‘ be true.
So many varied activities at Pitt
offer everyone a chance to meet
people and to work at what they‘re
interested in doing. 4 '

Many students however who
feel like “just one lost.member of
a crowd” could use and would ap-

gest and advise‘ them to lead a
better, a more rounded college

By LES GALLAGHER

The coming Student Congress
election promises to supply more
excitement than a triple tease
show at the local burlesk house.‘
The political dealings, double and
other wise, leave the coming elec-
tion a doubtful guess as to whom
will emerge the victor, Indepen-
dents or‘ Fraternities. As far as
the majority of the student body
is concerned it is_not too import-
ant which faction gains the laurels
of the sacred and reverend du-
ties of Student Congress but this
daunts not the will to win by the
contending parties. I
' This year the Fraternities are
more than a might worried about
their chances of regaining their
seats in Congress. They see the
possibility for the opportunity of
doing close to absolutely nothing
in Student Congress, _, slipping
through their fingers. The Frater-
nities hate to. see a wh__ol‘e_ year‘
of questionable glory pass ,-into
the handsaof their rivals.’ . _.~

Maybe, if another faction woul
gain the Congress offices, and do

something while in thoseCongre_ssj

‘offices, itjust might happen that
a do—something Independent Con-
gress would break the __back ‘of
Fraternity politics for a few years
-to come.

Fine idea

‘ The Fraternities must stop this
possibility at all cost and the cost

is $20 dollars._ It is rumored that

the Fraternity" political, big »wi‘/gs‘
have passed a motion-whereby all
fraternity -men, actively giving
support to the opposition_ party
(the Coalitionists),’will have the
Fraternity, which that black
sheep is affiliated with, be ﬁned
twenty dollars. This 20-buck ﬁne

Fraternity‘ « whose man supports‘
the opposition but that same Fra-
“ternity will be .20 skins poorer if
one of their men campaigns on
hisown behalf for a Congress seat.
The political wheels of the Fra-
ternity ..feel that this will ‘guar-
antee all hoped for votes will be

cast in the direction of their own .

_adopted Fraternity slate.-

This move by the Fraternities
will hurt their chances, of elec-
tion‘ by a far greater estimate
than anything they never did
while they were in Congress,
When money ‘and politics ‘are
mentioned in the same breath,
the connotation gets downright
ﬁlthy. One student even got so
mad that he started screaming
about an infringement on his
democratic principles. He. cried
that it was a moral threat to his
freedom of will and a detriment ‘to
his alienable, right of self ex-
pression. “Forbid it, Almighty
God,” he opined.

Wore Bh°nd_ei_‘s_. . _ H . . V

It is at this point that one won-
ders just what young, red-blood-
ed, American fraternity boy came"
up with this bright, young, Amer-

ican idea on how to save Frat pol— ,

itics at this UniVersity..The poor
lout musthavei been blinded by
the possibilities for self-publicity.
How could he have failed’ to see
the» damaging results of such "a
coercive move as the 20-buck ‘ﬁne,
ifvhe had the interests of his
party rather than self-interest.
close to’ his heart.

Not only does this stupid blun-
der by a Frat politico give the
Coalitionists ’ something to harp,
on but I’ll bet a three-legged chair
that it will also give the Young
Progressives an opportunity to
print up a smelly little handbill
to toss away at the entrance of the
school.

They’ll call thetprocedure un-
American and throw in wire-tap,-
ping, Civil Rights and ask us to
write our Congressman to stop
the red-herring trials before every
one in the country is asked to
contribute 20' bucks to put the Frat
men back in office.

Attention communists: I know
not what course. others may choose
but give me liberty minus the 20--
buck ﬁne. Our chains are forged
and their clanking may be heard
in the streets of Warsaw’, Sofia’ and

between Fifth and Forbes.

Music Notes

Coming Soon . . .

Dixielan(l,'in all its true glory, will be presented at the
Syria Mosque on April 29. Making thepresentation will be

Louis ‘.‘Satchm0” Armstrong and his unit. Some of the better ,,

known musicians that will appear on the program with Arm-

strong will be Jack Teagarden, trombone, Earl “Fatha” Hines, ‘ a

piano, “Big Sic ” Catlett, drums and Barney Bigard on clarinet.

Satchmo was raised on jazz and is‘ probably the mostf

colorful living personality in the ﬁeld of two beat.

He gained a. great_deal.of experience playing with King
Oliver. He and Oliver worked as a perfect combination onad
lib solos. Louis couldsense what Oliver was going to play and_
then ad libed in harmonybehind him. Louis got his start with
Oliver i11 1922. Since that time he has played on thestage,
in the movies..and on the radio.’ He has become the most "out-
standing exponent of Dixieland. ' ..

Editor, The Pitt News: V

I, like most tsudents, shake my
head in agreement with your ed-
criticizing
Pitt’s traditional‘ hodge-podge of ,
meaningless elections and Student
Congresses. Limited criticism,
however, can; be leveled against
the rank-and-ﬁle‘ student" simply
because he has failed to partici-
pate in hodge-podges. Had past
Congresses and the present been

would ' still have hodge-podge.
All this for a very good reason:
the various coalitions that appear

offer a _program worth the exer-
tion of voting ‘for it. This, also,
for a good reason: these coalitions.

do not concern‘ themselves with
the needs of the student body at
large, whose‘ votes ‘they hardly
bother to solicit; Asa result of
this situation, 'our'University of-
ﬁcials never even feel ‘a tug on
the leash you say they haveon
Student Congress. A

Unlike past years, an-effort is
being made this‘ year to rally
broad student support for a pro-
gram dealing with student issues.
This is being, done by a Com-
mittee for a Better Student Con-
gress, which has drawn up a pro-
gram and is circulating it as a
petition to the incoming Congress.
The CBSC platform asks the new
Student Congress to carry out the
main features of the following
program: ‘

Domestic—Work,  lower P

food and book prices; work for
a University low-rental dorm
project.

Social—Sponsor free month-
ly dances; provide a broad pro-

L _

‘the leash we are supposedly held.

By the time this letter appears,
the CBSC will have surveyedall,»
candidates in the. ﬁeld for their
position on this program. To help,
elect a better Student Congress,‘
the Committee ‘will recommend’
the support of those candidates‘
who take a ﬁrm stand for the plat-‘
form. If the independent voter
can recognize -the sincerity of the
CBSC and the possibility of ac-
complishing much of its program
through broad student action, this
election may upset the coalitions
and establish ’a precedent ' for
campaigning in the years ahead.

When there is a uniﬁed pull on

in check by, I believe we will ﬁnd

andthat. a big partvof our prob-
lem‘has been, with Student Con-
gresses that have not tried’ to

Denmnstration Black Planned
For Next Fall} Grid Games

All indications point to a new demonstration block at Pitt foot-
games next fall. Student Congress has accepted unanimously a report
on‘the proposal which was introduced at its meeting last Monday.

Firm backing for the project has been promised by the athletic

The actual running of the block is to be the joint responsibility
of a three-man committee composed of one representative each

Student Congress,. and the» head
cheerleader. Ben Grady has al-

ready been selected to act for
the athletic department; Student
Congress will appoint a repre-
sentative for its committee in the
near future.

Pitt has had demonstration
blocks before. Its last effort some
two years ago, however, lapsed
into oblivion because of cold stu-
dent support.

Scholar's Day

Program

Ogden Nash, famous writer andwit, will be the featured speak-J

er of the Scholar’s Day program,

scheduled it for April 27. '

Members of the faculty will also lead discussion groups. The
forums, each an hour long, will last from 9:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. 
and will cover a variety of subjects, according to Carol Kurtz,
publicity chairman. Two forums are scheduled for each hour.

This year’s Scholar’s Day will introduce an entirely new type-

of event to Pitt. Custom in the past has been for the_ event to béﬁ

held in_ Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and consisted 

tapping ceremonies only.

,‘ .g.

However, because of the poor attendance and the lack of en’-::3

thusiasm on the part of the stu-9

dents in past years, it was de-
cided to hold a new‘ type of cere-
mony .Following suggestions of
Dean Helen Rush, the Scholar’s
Day committee planned the pres-
ent program. .

Those students slated for tap-
ping will receive their _ribbons
through the mail before next
Wednesday and will wear them

during Scholar’s Day so that they"

can be recognized asbeing tapped.

Booklets containing gcomplete
lists of the tapped students will
be placed at convenient places in
the University for all to receive
one. '

The Scholar’s Day Committee
stressed that Scholar’s Day should
not be confused with Tap Day
which occurs during’ Spring. Festi-
val. .
Scholar’s Day is set aside to
honor those _students ‘active in
extra-curricular activities.

Students must have an overall
two point average to be eligible
for tapping on Scholar’s Day.’ _

Hit by Discus,
Finfrock Lucky
To Be Alive

For 11 years baseball and
track have thrived together at
The Stadium without an acci- ~
dent. Last Wednesday Left-
ﬁelder John Finfrock was rush-
ed to’ Presbyterian Hospital
lucky to be alive after being hit
on the head with an eight-pound
discus.

X-rays taken Thursday and
Friday showed there were no
broken bones. Hospital attend-
ants stated, although the injury
is not serious, Finfrock will not
be able to play baseball the re-
mainder of the season. He was
released fro-m the hospit_a_1 S_at_-
urday. ’ ‘--~_"

The accident, which could
easily have proved fatal, occur-
red when Dave Christofer’s foot‘
slippedgin the soft Stadium
track just as he 'made a practice
discus throw. ‘-

Christofer and several by-
standers warned Finfrock to
duck. He hunched his shoulders
and covered his head with his
hands. Fortunately the ﬂat part
of the saucer struck Finfrock
on the shoulder ﬁrst and then
glanced off the back of his head.

Finfrock spent 52 months as_
a B-29 pilot with nary a scratch.

If ‘balance is the dominant asset

To OSU, 7-2

Pitt won’t lose many tougher
tennis matches than the 7-2 de-
cision they handed to Ohio State
at Columbus on Saturday.

It was one of those matches
where a few breaks could have
turned a bad drubbing into an
easy victory.

' Johnny Lohstoetter was the
only Panther to win in singles
play. He then teamed up with
Stan Well in doubles to cop Pitt’s
--only other match triumph.

The Paiithers won the opening
set in four of the other ﬁve single
matches but then fell apart. Out-
side of Lohstoetter and Wei1’s vic-
tory, Pitt was outclassed in the
doubles, losing both matches in
straight sets. ‘

About the hardest’Pitt setback to
take was Joe Rauterkus’, 4-6, 7-5,
10-8, marathomloss.

Snow ﬂurries and high winds
cut down_the par of play onboth
sides. It was a day better suited
for 'a snowball battle than a ten-

BY LYNN C. MITCHELL

Ralph Mitterling’s Mittmen will have their eyes on the
sky hoping for clear Weather when they travel to Hunting-
don tomorrow for a single game with Juniata College.

A weekend of rain and snow put a damper on baseball
activity over the Easter holiday and brought with it a can-

cellation of the game scheduled with VVestern Reserve Satur-

day at the Stadium.

The Panthers will try once more
to prolong their winnings ways
when they face the Indians, who

.. ................................... .. two games of
the season.

ed six runs against the. Waynes-
burg Yellow Jackets l0 days ago
at The Stadium. .Calder shut out
the Jackets, 6-0., striking out 14
batters while giving up but four
hits. ‘

The Indians and the Panthers
each have won ﬁve games in the
10—game series which started orig-
inally in 1912. Last year Juniata
outlasted Pitt‘3-2 in a 15-inning
contest at The Stadium.

The Indians dropped their open-
er on April 1 at Bucknell, 13-2,
but were able to bang out a win
over Susquehanna in a free-hit-
ting affair, 8-6, on April 12.

Juniata Coach Bill Smaltz has
been faced with the task.of ﬁnd-
ing a starting hurler to replace
his 1948 star, Tom Kyper, but has
not met with much success.

Kyper became ineligible last-
summer when he played organiz-
ed ball. Smaltz is depending heav-
ily this year on Paul Peoples, who
did relief work in the 1949 game
at The Stadium. '

The Panthers return home for
the next game on. Friday with

Johnny Chickerneo, the man whom Mike Milligan recently hired
to nurse his quarterbacks, should get along well with his pupils. He

"stands for quarterbacks’ rights.

Prior to this year's rule change on unlimited substitution, the
coaches have -been calling the plays. And that is a situation whic/h
certainly needed alterations, says Chickerneo, who was once;a sig-

career ran a normal. course.

In spring drills back in 1936, he
was plugging away as a substi-
tute fullback for Jock Sutherland’s
squad. The quarterback ranks,
however, were ‘struck with _a
plague of injuries, and soon Suth-
erland found himself with prac-
tically no quarterbacks on hand. ‘

“Somebody had to take the job,”
said Chickerneo.

And then, nodding.toward Line

“But to the very end of my col- _

lege days, I was sorry I was a
quarterback. I always wanted to

play fullback.”

Although it is true that” the
blocking quarterback in Jock
Sutherland’s single. wing system

was an .. unglamorous performer,
was it not also true that Chicker-
neo might not have earned a ﬁrst

_“I don’t‘think so,” he replied.
